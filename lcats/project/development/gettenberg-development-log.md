# Gettenberg development process log

For [WS-GETTENBERG](../workstreams/proposed/WS-GETTENBERG.md) under the
[pilot charter](gettenberg-pilot-charter.md). WIs/execution records remain
authoritative for scope/delivery. Historical entries retain their original state;
current run checkpoints appear below.

## Entry and checkpoint format

Entries record UTC time, run/parent and WI/execution links, actor role,
base/head SHAs, decision/hypothesis, action/result, verification evidence,
friction/rework, and proposed LRH improvement. Label observations separately
from interpretations and proposals. Amend explicitly; omit transcripts/secrets.

Checkpoints add charter revision/grant, start/deadline, elapsed and worker
minutes, assignment count/active workers, measured usage or unavailable,
staged dependency evidence, review/check status, remaining scope, unresolved
findings, and exact next action. Live state belongs in this log and execution
records, never an assistant role directory. Avoid duplicating WI statuses.

## 2026-10-14 — Planning capture; execution not started

- Authority: human requested one review PR for charter/initial plan; accepted
  three maximum agents, two-hour first-run ceiling, and one final promotion
  unless review size, integration risk, or a design issue justifies an earlier
  milestone proposal.
- Planning base: LCATS `75eaf9e6`; governing design merged in PR #501.
- Observation: `/lrh-execute` requires origin/main availability and resolved
  dependencies; current chain defaults stop on failing CI. These differ from
  the proposed integration-branch repair loop.
- Interpretation: a scoped adapter requires explicit authority and staged
  dependency evidence; unchanged skill invocation would misrepresent lifecycle.
- Proposed procedure: preserve native records/checks; distinguish staged
  integration from main landing and agent decisions from human approval.
- Proposed usage: 120 coordinator plus 60 cumulative worker minutes; four
  assignments; 20 worker minutes reserved for review; final 30 elapsed minutes
  for verification/checkpoint. This is not a credit guarantee. No pilot token
  or monetary consumption has been measured.
- Hypothesis: bounded delegation reduces human interruptions while retaining
  review quality at acceptable total effort. No speedup is established.
- LRH recommendation candidate: represent branch-scoped dependency acceptance
  and delegated integration separately from main delivery/human approval.
  Future acceptance test: staged evidence may unblock a scoped child but cannot
  resolve a global WI or authorize main merge.
- Evidence: [workstream/charter creation](../executions/AD_HOC/2026_10_14_06_19_47_WS_GETTENBERG.md)
  and [bootstrap item creation](../executions/AD_HOC/2026_10_14_06_19_47_WI_GETTENBERG_0001.md)
  record planning validation; they do not represent implementation.
- Next: review/land the planning PR, then obtain explicit start authority and
  create the first run checkpoint. No execution grant or deadline is implied.

## 2026-10-14 07:55:39 UTC — Run 1 authorized and started

- Run: `gettenberg-20261014`; human explicitly instructed "Please start the
  two-hour pilot as previously discussed." Charter revision `1dff24a94f37a5f341d11c30301a9cc50cdffe6a`;
  main/base `5cfd2d71caf6f3eedfdfc0b830b5c5ff1a74ba3b` includes planning closeout
  and the separately confirmed gate restamp. Integration branch:
  `codex/gettenberg-pilot-20261014`.
- Deadline: 09:55:39 UTC; no new features after 09:25:39 UTC. Limits: 3 live
  agents, 4 assignments, 60 worker minutes including waits; 20 reserved for
  review. No runtime-enforced credit meter; per-run tokens/cost unavailable.
- Coordinator plan accepted under charter: execute WI-GETTENBERG-0001 first,
  modifying baseline/evidence, development log, release reconciliation, and
  scoped downstream WIs. No library, notebook, CI, dependency, or corpus edits
  in this item. Prior-art check present; native readiness true with no warnings;
  prompt idempotence check returned no records.
- Prompt: `PROMPT(WI-GETTENBERG-0001:WI_GETTENBERG_0001)[2026-10-14T07:56:37+00:00]`.
  Validation: project environment, bound imports, version/format/lint/test,
  LRH validation, native WI readiness, manual matrix/caller evidence trace,
  independent review and exact-head checks before internal integration.
- [Preflight](evidence/gettenberg-pilot-20261014/preflight.json): CLI
  `0.2.5.dev3596+gd86755f50`; all 18 watched Claude/Codex fingerprints fresh;
  skip consent invalid as expected. Explicit charter grant supplies run authority.
  No restamp or consent writes. CLI prompt/readiness/merge operations available.
- Observation: installed validation guidance supports `scripts/test --log`, but
  LCATS's actual script forwards that option to unittest. Adapter uses output
  redirection around `scripts/test`; it preserves tests without modifying tools.
- Assignment 1: `pilot_caller_audit`, read-only, base equal to main, dispatched
  about 07:57 UTC, deadline 08:12 UTC, 15-minute ceiling. No allowed write paths,
  no recursive delegation/network acquisition. Returns cited caller inventory
  and migration/library-extraction recommendations to coordinator. Other agents
  from earlier planning runs are completed/errored, not live assignments.
- Review state: none yet; no staged prerequisites accepted. Remaining scope:
  baseline, reconciliation, downstream planning, then only qualified work that
  fits the budget. Next action: inspect current upstream capabilities/cache
  inputs and establish offline baseline evidence.
