# Summary

Pre-merge verification pass on PR #147 (follow-up discussion review
fixes). Verification was classified inline (user declined the offered
cold-subagent pass). `rerun_of` is left empty: this PR was a direct
user-directed content update, not a `/lrh-work-item`/`/lrh-implement`
flow, so no primary execution record was minted for this specific
branch/slug.

# Result

`lrh github threads --mode raw --state all` filtered to `isResolved ==
false` showed all 4 original threads were still unresolved before this
run (none auto-resolved by a bot this round).

All 4 verified against the current `HEAD` diff and file content (not the
prior `_REVIEW` execution record's claims):

- `PRRT_kwDOKlhIbM6TVE7K` (chatgpt-codex-connector, bot) — torchdata
  consumers — confirmed the current text acknowledges `KMo/scenes.py`,
  `KMo/analyze.py`, and the notebooks as real consumers, no longer claims
  the module is unused. **Clear-satisfied.**
- `PRRT_kwDOKlhIbM6TVE7Q` (chatgpt-codex-connector, bot) — UDPipe
  multilingual comparison — confirmed UDPipe's 93-language/169-model UD
  2.15 coverage is now included, no longer framed as Stanza-only.
  **Clear-satisfied.**
- `PRRT_kwDOKlhIbM6TVE7R` (chatgpt-codex-connector, bot) — downstream
  spaCy instruction — confirmed option 2 in the "Tension" section now
  points to the roadmap decision (spaCy/Stanza/UDPipe depending on
  direction) instead of naming spaCy as settled. **Clear-satisfied.**
- `PRRT_kwDOKlhIbM6TVFms` (copilot-pull-request-reviewer, bot) — same
  torchdata-consumers issue as the first thread — confirmed fixed.
  **Clear-satisfied.**

All 4 were bot-authored, pre-selected, user-confirmed as a single batch,
and resolved via `resolveReviewThread`. No exceptions surfaced.

Thread-resolution verdict: **green** — every unresolved thread resolved, no
exceptions remain.

# Validation

- `lrh github threads --mode raw --state all` — 4 threads, all
  `isResolved: false` before this run
- Fresh-eyes diff/file read against each comment — all 4 Clear-satisfied
- `gh api graphql resolveReviewThread` — all 4 threads now `isResolved: true`
- Provisional CI (`gh pr checks --json name,state,bucket`, after confirming
  0 `required_status_checks` rules via `rules/branches/main`): `coverage`,
  `lint`, `test` x2 all `pass`
- Re-checked CI against post-push `HEAD` in the readiness report below

# Follow-up

- `session_transcript: pending` should be updated to `claude-app:<session-id>`
  after this session ends.
- Final merge-readiness verdict and `gh pr merge` one-liner are reported to
  the user after this record is pushed and CI is re-checked against the new
  `HEAD`.
