    "body": "\nThe moonbeams came through two deep and narrow windows, and showed a\nspacious chamber, richly furnished in an antique fashion.  From one\nlattice, the shadow of the diamond panes was thrown upon the floor;\nthe ghostly light, through the other, slept upon a bed, falling\nbetween the heavy silken curtains, and illuminating the face of a\nyoung man.  But, how quietly the slumberer lay! how pale his features!\nand how like a shroud the sheet was wound about his frame!  Yes; it\nwas a corpse, in its burial-clothes.\n\nSuddenly, the fixed features seemed to move, with dark emotion.\nStrange fantasy!  It was but the shadow of the fringed curtain, waving\nbetwixt the dead face and the moonlight, as the door of the chamber\nopened, and a girl stole softly to the bedside.  Was there delusion in\nthe moonbeams, or did her gesture and her eye betray a gleam of\ntriumph, as she bent over the pale corpse-pale as itself--and pressed\nher living lips to the cold ones of the dead?  As she drew back from\nthat long kiss, her features writhed, as if a proud heart were\nfighting with its anguish. Again it seemed that the features of the\ncorpse had moved responsive to her own.  Still an illusion!  The\nsilken curtain had waved, a second time, betwixt the dead face and the\nmoonlight, as another fair young girl unclosed the door, and glided,\nghost-like, to the bedside.  There the two maidens stood, both\nbeautiful, with the pale beauty of the dead between them. But she, who\nhad first entered, was proud and stately; and the other, a soft and\nfragile thing.\n\n\"Away!\" cried the lofty one.   \"Thou hadst him living!  The dead is\nmine!\"\n\n\"Thine!\" returned the other, shuddering.   \"Well hast thou spoken!\nThe dead is thine!\"\n\nThe proud girl started, and stared into her face, with a ghastly look.\nBut a wild and mournful expression passed across the features of the\ngentle one; and, weak and helpless, she sank down on the bed, her head\npillowed beside that of the corpse, and her hair mingling with his\ndark locks.  A creature of hope and joy, the first draught of sorrow\nhad bewildered her.\n\n\"Edith!\" cried her rival.\n\nEdith groaned, as with a sudden compression of the heart; and removing\nher cheek from the dead youth's pillow, she stood upright, fearfully\nencountering the eyes of the lofty girl.\n\n\"Wilt thou betray me?\" said the latter, calmly.\n\n\"Till the dead bid me speak, I will be silent,\" answered Edith. \"Leave\nus alone together!  Go, and live many years, and then return, and tell\nme of thy life.  He, too, will be here!  Then, if thou tellest of\nsufferings more than death, we will both forgive thee.\"\n\n\"And what shall be the token?\" asked the proud girl, as if her heart\nacknowledged a meaning in these wild words.\n\n\"This lock of hair,\" said Edith, lifting one of the dark, clustering\ncurls, that lay heavily on the dead man's brow.\n\nThe two maidens joined their hands over the bosom of the corpse, and\nappointed a day and hour, far, far in time to come, for their next\nmeeting in that chamber.  The statelier girl gave one deep look at the\nmotionless countenance, and departed,--yet turned again and trembled,\nere she closed the door, almost believing that her dead lover frowned\nupon her.  And Edith, too!  Was not her white form fading into the\nmoonlight?  Scorning her own weakness, she went forth, and perceived\nthat a negro slave was waiting in the passage, with a wax light, which\nhe held between her face and his own, and regarded her, as she\nthought, with an ugly expression of merriment.  Lifting his torch on\nhigh, the slave lighted her down the staircase, and undid the portal\nof the mansion.  The young clergyman of the town had just ascended the\nsteps, and bowing to the lady, passed in without a word.\n\n\nYears, many years rolled on; the world seemed new again, so much older\nwas it grown, since the night when those pale girls had clasped their\nhands across the bosom of the corpse.  In the interval, a lonely woman\nhad passed from youth to extreme age, and was known by all the town,\nas the  \"Old Maid in the Winding-Sheet.\"  A taint of insanity had\naffected her whole life, but so quiet, sad, and gentle, so utterly\nfree from violence, that she was suffered to pursue her harmless\nfantasies, unmolested by the world, with whose business or pleasures\nshe had naught to do.  She dwelt alone, and never came into the\ndaylight, except to follow funerals.  Whenever a corpse was borne\nalong the street, in sunshine, rain, or snow, whether a pompous train,\nof the rich and proud, thronged after it, or few and humble were the\nmourners, behind them came the lonely woman, in a long, white garment,\nwhich the people called her shroud.  She took no place among the\nkindred or the friends, but stood at the door to hear the funeral\nprayer, and walked in the rear of the procession, as one whose earthly\ncharge it was to haunt the house of mourning, and be the shadow of\naffliction, and see that the dead were duly buried.  So long had this\nbeen her custom, that the inhabitants of the town deemed her a part of\nevery funeral, as much as the coffin pall, or the very corpse itself,\nand augured ill of the sinner's destiny, unless the  \"Old Maid in the\nWinding-Sheet\" came gliding, like a ghost, behind.  Once, it is said,\nshe affrighted a bridal party, with her pale presence, appearing\nsuddenly in the illuminated hall, just as the priest was uniting a\nfalse maid to a wealthy man, before her lover had been dead a year.\nEvil was the omen to that marriage!  Sometimes she stole forth by\nmoonlight, and visited the graves of venerable Integrity, and wedded\nLove, and virgin Innocence, and every spot where the ashes of a kind\nand faithful heart were mouldering. Over the hillocks of those favored\ndead would she stretch out her arms, with a gesture, as if she were\nscattering seeds; and many believed that she brought them from the\ngarden of Paradise; for the graves, which she had visited, were green\nbeneath the snow, and covered with sweet flowers from April to\nNovember.  Her blessing was better than a holy verse upon the\ntombstone.  Thus wore away her long, sad, peaceful, and fantastic\nlife, till few were so old as she, and the people of later generations\nwondered how the dead had ever been buried, or mourners had endured\ntheir grief, without the  \"Old Maid in the Winding Sheet.\"\n\nStill, years went on, and still she followed funerals, and was not yet\nsummoned to her own festival of death.  One afternoon, the great\nstreet of the town was all alive with business and bustle, though the\nsun now gilded only the upper half of the church-spire, having left\nthe housetops and loftiest trees in shadow.  The scene was cheerful\nand animated, in spite of the sombre shade between the high brick\nbuildings.  Here were pompous merchants, in white wigs and laced\nvelvet; the bronzed faces of sea-captains; the foreign garb and air of\nSpanish creoles; and the disdainful port of natives of Old England;\nall contrasted with the rough aspect of one or two hack settlers,\nnegotiating sales of timber, from forests where axe had never sounded.\nSometimes a lady passed, swelling roundly forth in an embroidered\npetticoat, balancing her steps in high-heeled shoes, and courtesying,\nwith lofty grace, to the punctilious obeisances of the gentlemen.  The\nlife of the town seemed to have its very centre not far from an old\nmansion, that stood somewhat back from the pavement, surrounded by\nneglected grass, with a strange air of loneliness, rather deepened\nthan dispelled by the throng so near it.  Its site would have been\nsuitably occupied by a magnificent Exchange, or a brick block,\nlettered all over with various signs; or the large house itself might\nhave made a noble tavern, with the  \"King's Arms\" swinging before it,\nand guests in every chamber, instead of the present solitude.  But,\nowing to some dispute about the right of inheritance, the mansion had\nbeen long without a tenant, decaying from year to year, and throwing\nthe stately gloom of its shadow over the busiest part of the town.\nSuch was the scene, and such the time, when a figure, unlike any that\nhave been described, was observed at a distance down the street.\n\n\"I espy a strange sail, yonder,\" remarked a Liverpool captain; \"that\nwoman in the long, white garment!\"\n\nThe sailor seemed much struck by the object, as were several others,\nwho, at the same moment, caught a glimpse of the figure that had\nattracted his notice.  Almost immediately, the various topics of\nconversation gave place to speculations, in an undertone, on this\nunwonted occurrence.\n\n\"Can there be a funeral, so late this afternoon?\"  inquired some.\n\nThey looked for the signs of death at every door,--the sexton, the\nhearse, the assemblage of black-clad relatives,--all that makes up the\nwoeful pomp of funerals.  They raised their eyes, also, to the sun-gilt\nspire of the church, and wondered that no clang proceeded from its\nbell, which had always tolled till now, when this figure appeared in\nthe light of day.  But none had heard that a corpse was to be borne to\nits home that afternoon, nor was there any token of a funeral, except\nthe apparition of the \"Old Maid in the Winding-Sheet.\"\n\n\"What may this portend?\" asked each man of his neighbor.\n\nAll smiled as they put the question, yet with a certain trouble in\ntheir eyes, as if pestilence, or some other wide calamity, were\nprognosticated by the untimely intrusion among the living, of one\nwhose presence had always been associated with death and woe.  What a\ncomet is to the earth, was that sad woman to the town.  Still she\nmoved on, while the hum of surprise was hushed at her approach, and\nthe proud and the humble stood aside, that her white garment might not\nwave against them.  It was a long, loose robe, of spotless purity.\nIts wearer appeared very old, pale, emaciated, and feeble, yet glided\nonward, without the unsteady pace of extreme age.  At one point of her\ncourse, a littly rosy boy burst forth from a door, and ran, with open\narms, towards the ghostly woman, seeming to expect a kiss from her\nbloodless lips.  She made a slight pause, fixing her eye upon him with\nan expression of no earthly sweetness, so that the child shivered and\nstood awe-struck, rather than affrighted, while the Old Maid passed\non.  Perhaps her garment might have been polluted even by an infant's\ntouch; perhaps her kiss would have been death to the sweet boy, within\na year.\n\n\"She is but a shadow,\" whispered the superstitious.   \"The child put\nforth his arms and could not grasp her robe!\"\n\nThe wonder was increased, when the Old Maid passed beneath the porch\nof the deserted mansion, ascended the moss-covered steps, lifted the\niron knocker, and gave three raps.  The people could only conjecture,\nthat some old remembrance, troubling her bewildered brain, had\nimpelled the poor woman hither to visit the friends of her youth; all\ngone from their home, long since and forever, unless their ghosts\nstill haunted it,--fit company for the  \"Old Maid in the\nWinding-Sheet.\"  An elderly man approached the steps, and reverently\nuncovering his gray locks, essayed to explain the matter.\n\n\"None, Madam,\" said he, \"have dwelt in this house these fifteen years\nagone,--no, not since the death of old Colonel Fenwicke, whose funeral\nyou may remember to have followed.  His heirs being ill-agreed among\nthemselves, have let the mansion-house go to ruin.\"\n\nThe Old Maid looked slowly round, with a slight gesture of one hand,\nand a finger of the other upon her lip, appearing more shadow-like\nthan ever, in the obscurity of the porch.  But again she lifted the\nhammer, and gave, this time, a single rap.  Could it be that a\nfootstep was now heard, coming down the staircase of the old mansion,\nwhich all conceived to have been so long untenanted?  Slowly, feebly,\nyet heavily, like the pace of an aged and infirm person, the step\napproached, more distinct on every downward stair, till it reached the\nportal.  The bar fell on the inside; the door was opened.  One upward\nglance, towards the church-spire, whence the sunshine had just faded,\nwas the last that the people saw of the \"Old Maid in the Winding-Sheet.\"\n\n\"Who undid the door?\" asked many.\n\nThis question, owing to the depth of shadow beneath the porch, no one\ncould satisfactorily answer.  Two or three aged men, while protesting\nagainst an inference, which might be drawn, affirmed that the person\nwithin was a negro, and bore a singular resemblance to old Caesar,\nformerly a slave in the house, but freed by death some thirty years\nbefore.\n\n\"Her summons has waked up a servant of the old family,\" said one, half\nseriously.\n\n\"Let us wait here,\" replied another.   \"More guests will knock at the\ndoor, anon.  But the gate of the graveyard should be thrown open!\"\n\nTwilight had overspread the town, before the crowd began to separate,\nor the comments on this incident were exhausted.  One after another\nwas wending his way homeward, when a coach--no common spectacle in\nthose days--drove slowly into the street.  It was an old-fashioned\nequipage, hanging close to the ground, with arms on the panels, a\nfootman behind, and a grave, corpulent coachman seated high in\nfront,--the whole giving an idea of solemn state and dignity.  There\nwas something awful, in the heavy rumbling of the wheels.  The coach\nrolled down the street, till, coming to the gateway of the deserted\nmansion, it drew up, and the footman sprang to the ground.\n\n\"Whose grand coach is this?\" asked a very inquisitive body.\n\nThe footman made no reply, but ascended the steps of the old house,\ngave three raps with the iron hammer, and returned to open the\ncoach-door.  An old man possessed of the heraldic lore so common in\nthat day examined the shield of arms on the panel.\n\n\"Azure, a lion's head erased, between three flower-deluces,\" said he;\nthen whispered the name of the family to whom these bearings belonged.\nThe last inheritor of its honors was recently dead, after a long\nresidence amid the splendor of the British court, where his birth and\nwealth had given him no mean station.  \"He left no child,\" continued\nthe herald, \"and these arms, being in a lozenge, betoken that the\ncoach appertains to his widow.\"\n\nFurther disclosures, perhaps, might have been made, had not the\nspeaker suddenly been struck dumb, by the stern eye of an ancient\nlady, who thrust forth her head from the coach, preparing to descend.\nAs she emerged, the people saw that her dress was magnificent, and her\nfigure dignified, in spite of age and infirmity,--a stately ruin, but\nwith a look, at once, of pride and wretchedness.  Her strong and rigid\nfeatures had an awe about them, unlike that of the white Old Maid, but\nas of something evil.  She passed up the steps, leaning on a gold-headed\ncane; the door swung open, as she ascended,--and the light of a\ntorch glittered on the embroidery of her dress, and gleamed on the\npillars of the porch.  After a momentary pause--a glance backwards--and\nthen a desperate effort--she went in.  The decipherer of the coat\nof arms had ventured up the lowest step, and shrinking back\nimmediately, pale and tremulous, affirmed that the torch was held by\nthe very image of old Caesar.\n\n\"But, such a hideous grin,\" added he, \"was never seen on the face of\nmortal man, black or white!  It will haunt me till my dying day.\"\n\nMeantime, the coach had wheeled round, with a prodigious clatter on\nthe pavement, and rumbled up the street, disappearing in the twilight,\nwhile the ear still tracked its course.  Scarcely was it gone, when\nthe people began to question whether the coach and attendants, the\nancient lady, the spectre of old Caesar, and the Old Maid herself,\nwere not all a strangely combined delusion, with some dark purport in\nits mystery.  The whole town was astir, so that, instead of\ndispersing, the crowd continually increased, and stood gazing up at\nthe windows of the mansion, now silvered by the brightening moon.  The\nelders, glad to indulge the narrative propensity of age, told of the\nlong-faded splendor of the family, the entertainments they had given,\nand the guests, the greatest of the land, and even titled and noble\nones from abroad, who had passed beneath that portal.  These graphic\nreminiscences seemed to call up the ghosts of those to whom they\nreferred.  So strong was the impression, on some of the more\nimaginative hearers, that two or three were seized with trembling\nfits, at one and the same moment, protesting that they had distinctly\nheard three other raps of the iron knocker.\n\n\"Impossible!\" exclaimed others.   \"See!  The moon shines beneath the\nporch, and shows every part of it, except in the narrow shade of that\npillar.  There is no one there!\"\n\n\"Did not the door open?\"  whispered one of these fanciful persons.\n\n\"Didst thou see it, too?\" said his companion, in a startled tone.\n\nBut the general sentiment was opposed to the idea, that a third\nvisitant had made application at the door of the deserted house. A\nfew, however, adhered to this new marvel, and even declared that a red\ngleam, like that of a torch, had shone through the great front window,\nas if the negro were lighting a guest up the staircase.  This, too,\nwas pronounced a mere fantasy.  But, at once, the whole multitude\nstarted, and each man beheld his own terror painted in the faces of\nall the rest.\n\n\"What an awful thing is this!\" cried they.\n\nA shriek, too fearfully distinct for doubt, had been heard within the\nmansion, breaking forth suddenly, and succeeded by a deep stillness,\nas if a heart had burst in giving it utterance.  The people knew not\nwhether to fly from the very sight of the house, or to rush trembling\nin, and search out the strange mystery. Amid their confusion and\naffright, they were somewhat reassured by the appearance of their\nclergyman, a venerable patriarch, and equally a saint, who had taught\nthem and their fathers the way to heaven, for more than the space of\nan ordinary lifetime.  He was a reverend figure, with long, white hair\nupon his shoulders, a white beard upon his breast, and a back so bent\nover his staff, that he seemed to be looking downward, continually, as\nif to choose a proper grave for his weary frame.  It was some time\nbefore the good old man, being deaf, and of impaired intellect, could\nbe made to comprehend such portions of the affair as were\ncomprehensible at all.  But, when possessed of the facts, his energies\nassumed unexpected vigor.\n\n\"Verily,\" said the old gentleman, \"it will be fitting that I enter the\nmansion-house of the worthy Colonel Fenwicke, lest any harm should\nhave befallen that true Christian woman, whom ye call the 'Old Maid in\nthe Winding-Sheet.'\"\n\nBehold, then, the venerable clergyman ascending the steps of the\nmansion, with a torch-bearer behind him.  It was the elderly man, who\nhad spoken to the Old Maid, and the same who had afterwards explained\nthe shield of arms, and recognized the features of the negro.  Like\ntheir predecessors, they gave three raps, with the iron hammer.\n\n\"Old Caesar cometh not,\" observed the priest.  \"Well, I wot, he no\nlonger doth service in this mansion.\"\n\n\"Assuredly, then, it was something worse, in old Caesar's likeness!\"\nsaid the other adventurer.\n\n\"Be it as God wills,\" answered the clergyman.  \"See! my strength,\nthough it be much decayed, hath sufficed to open this heavy door. Let\nus enter, and pass up the staircase.\"\n\nHere occurred a singular exemplification of the dreamy state of a very\nold man's mind.  As they ascended the wide flight of stairs, the aged\nclergyman appeared to move with caution, occasionally standing aside,\nand oftener bending his head, as it were in salutation, thus\npractising all the gestures of one who makes his way through a throng.\nReaching the head of the staircase, he looked around, with sad and\nsolemn benignity, laid aside his staff, bared his hoary locks, and was\nevidently on the point of commencing a prayer.\n\n\"Reverend Sir,\" said his attendant, who conceived this a very suitable\nprelude to their further search, \"would it not be well, that the\npeople join with us in prayer?\"\n\n\"Well-a-day!\" cried the old clergyman, staring strangely around him.\n\"Art thou here with me, and none other?  Verily, past times were\npresent to me, and I deemed that I was to make a funeral prayer, as\nmany a time heretofore, from the head of this staircase.\n\n\"Of a truth, I saw the shades of many that are gone.  Yea, I have\nprayed at their burials, one after another, and the 'Old Maid in the\nWinding-Sheet' hath seen them to their graves!\"\n\nBeing now more thoroughly awake to their present purpose, he took his\nstaff, and struck forcibly on the floor, till there came an echo from\neach deserted chamber, but no menial, to answer their summons.  They\ntherefore walked along the passage, and again paused, opposite to the\ngreat front window, through which was seen the crowd, in the shadow\nand partial moonlight of the street beneath.  On their right hand was\nthe open door of a chamber, and a closed one on their left.  The\nclergyman pointed his cane to the carved oak panel of the latter.\n\n\"Within that chamber,\" observed he, \"a whole lifetime since, did I sit\nby the death-bed of a goodly young man, who, being now at the last\ngasp--\"\n\nApparently, there was some powerful excitement in the ideas which had\nnow flashed across his mind.  He snatched the torch from his\ncompanion's hand, and threw open the door with such sudden violence,\nthat the flame was extinguished, leaving them no other light than the\nmoonbeams, which fell through two windows into the spacious chamber.\nIt was sufficient to discover all that could be known.  In a\nhigh-backed oaken arm-chair, upright, with her hands clasped across her\nbreast, and her head thrown back, sat the  \"Old Maid in the\nWinding-Sheet.\"  The stately dame had fallen on her knees, with her\nforehead on the holy knees of the Old Maid, one hand upon the floor, and\nthe other pressed convulsively against her heart.  It clutched a lock of\nhair, once sable, now discolored with a greenish mould.  As the priest\nand layman advanced into the chamber, the Old Maid's features assumed\nsuch a resemblance of shifting expression, that they trusted to hear\nthe whole mystery explained, by a single word.  But it was only the\nshadow of a tattered curtain, waving betwixt the dead face and the\nmoonlight.\n\n\"Both dead!\" said the venerable man.  \"Then who shall divulge the\nsecret?  Methinks it glimmers to and fro in my mind, like the light\nand shadow across the Old Maid's face.  And now't is gone!\"",
