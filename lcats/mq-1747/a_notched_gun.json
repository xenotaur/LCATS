    "body": "By Walt Coburn\n\n    Walt Coburn gives us a moving little story that swings a\n    dramatic arc from the Old West to the battlefields of France.\n\n\nSam Graybull was a killer. He proved it now as he backed slowly out of\nthe Valley Bank with a smoking Colt in one hand and a gunnysack full of\ncurrency in the other. The teller had made a move for the automatic\nbelow the money counter. Sam Graybull\u2019s bullet had caught the\nunfortunate man between the eyes.\n\nThe cashier, his movements sluggish from stark fear, made a break for\nthe side door and was shot in the back.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be next,\u201d he told the young lady stenographer, \u201cif you let out\none yap.\u201d\n\nThe blizzard outside muffled the sound of the shots. There was no one\nabroad in the little storm-swept cow town to block San Graybull\u2019s\ndeparture. He mounted the horse that stood humped in the snow. In five\nminutes he was lost in the storm, made thicker by the shadows of dusk.\nHe left no telltale sign. Because the country between Milk River and the\nBad Lands was as familiar as a child\u2019s back yard, he had no fear of\ncapture. He tied the sackful of money to his saddle and fashioned a\ncigaret with thick, blunt fingers that were steady.\n\n\u201cThat damn\u2019 bank dude\u2019s mouth flopped open shore comical.\u201d The rattle of\nSam Graybull\u2019s laugh was blurred by the wind.\n\nNo fear of pursuit marred the killer\u2019s flight. He knew the ways of\nsheriff\u2019s posses. They would hole up at the first ranch. That is why he\nhad held off till the storm broke, then rode into town and stuck up the\nbank. A one man job. Cunningly planned, cold bloodedly executed. The\nlives he had taken were but tally notches on his gun, no more. He would\nboast about it when he got drunk.\n\n\u201cThat other\u2019n piled up like a beef.\u201d\n\nThe storm swirled and moaned. The horse drifted with the wind, headed\nsouth for the Bad Lands. A man could hole up there and get plenty drunk.\nGrub in the cabin. Wood enough for a month. Hay a-plenty. A keg of\nmoonshine licker. When a man got hard up for company, there was Pete\nPeralta and his wife across the river. Pete was a damn\u2019 fool but he\nknowed how to keep his mouth shut. Pete was all right. Just didn\u2019t have\nthe guts to go out and take chances, that was all. Mebbe if it wasn\u2019t\nfer the missus, Pete might swap a hayfork fer a gun and pick up some\neasy money. Pete\u2019s missus was just a young thing. Purty enough, so far\nas looks went. Kinda quiet. Scairt, like as not, because she wa\u2019n\u2019t used\nto men that had guts. But she had sense. Close mouthed like most \u2019breed\nwomen. No damn\u2019 sheriff\u2019d ever git anything outa Rose Peralta.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was getting dark now. Black as a hat. Sam Graybull shrank into his\nbuffalo coat and let his horse drift along. He rode good horses.\nWhenever Sam Graybull stole a horse he picked a good one. It was nearly\na hundred miles into the Larb Hills where they dropped in timbered\nridges to meet the Missouri River. To travel all night in a blizzard was\nonly part of a man\u2019s job. The same as killing those two bank dudes. And\nby evening tomorrow he would be at his cabin in the Bad Lands.\n\n\u201cThat keg\u2019ll look good.\u201d\n\nSam Graybull liked whisky. He liked whisky like most men like women.\nLiked the color of it in a glass. Liked the gurgle of the stuff as it\nspilled out of a jug into a tin cup. Talk about music. The burn of it\nwhen a man tilted a jug and drank it thataway. God, fer a drink right\nnow.\n\nBut Sam Graybull dared not drink till he got home. Tried it onct. Fell\noff a horse and froze both feet sleepin\u2019 in the snow. Peter Peralta was\nhorse huntin\u2019 and found him. Pete\u2019s missus taken care of him. Pete\nwasn\u2019t much of a hand to drink. A few shots and Pete had a-plenty. Just\nenough to make that fiddle talk good. \u201cThe Red River Jig\u201d and \u201cHell\nAmong the Yearling\u2019s\u201d and \u201cCross Eyed Moses.\u201d \u2019Breed tunes.\n\nSam hadn\u2019t seen Pete and his missus since early last spring. They were\nthe only friends he claimed. A man on the dodge can\u2019t have many friends.\nNot when there\u2019s a big bounty on his scalp. That\u2019s the way most of the\nboys got theirs. Trustin\u2019 somebody. Hell, them fool posses never got\nnowhere. Milled around. And when they followed Sam Graybull they kept\nbunched. Damn\u2019 right they did.\n\nSam had been in Wyoming all summer. Gamblin\u2019 some amongst the sheep\nshearers. Gettin\u2019 drunk and eatin\u2019 good. Nobody the wiser. Who\u2019d look\naround sheep camps fer a cow hand? Then he\u2019d up and shot that Mexican\nshearer and had to drift back into Montana again. Too quick on the\ntrigger.\n\nSam\u2019s rattling laugh broke forth again. He took out his .45 and with the\nnail file blade of his jacknife, he made two fresh notches on the gun\u2019s\nbone handle. That was the Indian in him. Sam was about a quarter breed\nSioux. He was proud of those notches. Six, all told, counting the two\nbank dudes. Not bad fer a man thirty-one. He\u2019d tell Pete and his missus.\nPete\u2019d grin kinda silly. The missus\u2019d just sit and shiver like she was\ntook with a chill. Scairt of a man that had guts. A man that was quick\non the trigger.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nInto the black maw of the ca\u00f1ons and draws. Snow piling in till a man\nfelt smothered. Black as a hat. Cold. Give a dollar fer a drink. Hell,\ngive five dollars. Ten. There was money a-plenty in that sack. Whisky\nmoney.\n\nTopping out on a long ridge. Into a dawn that was the color of dirty\nslate. A wind that bit plumb into a man\u2019s innards. Didn\u2019t dast drop into\na ranch or even a sheep camp fer grub. There'd be no fool sign fer a\nposse to pick up. Nobody but Pete knew of that little log cabin tucked\naway in a pocket of the Bad Lands. Pines and brush and rocks. Grub\ncached. Shoot a black-tail buck or a yearlin\u2019. What\u2019s two days without\ngrub? Make a man eat good when he got it. Whisky and meat. Good whisky\nand fat meat. Half way home now. Safe as dog in a hole.\n\nKeep to the coulees, just under the rim of the ridges. No use skylinin\u2019\na man\u2019s self. All day. Horse gittin\u2019 laig weary. Stumbled into a badger\nhole. No harm done. Wind that shriveled a man\u2019s heart. Wind that cut the\nhide on a man\u2019s face. Feet like ice cakes. Like the blood was dried up.\nGod, but that whisky\u2019d send it chargin\u2019 through a man\u2019s veins, though.\nFill a jug and go acrost to Pete Peralta\u2019s. A man needed talk when he\u2019d\nbin alone so long. Pete\u2019d drag out the fiddle. \u201cRed River Jig.\u201d \u201cHell\namong the Yearlin\u2019s.\u201d \u201cBlue Bottles.\u201d\n\nHe pulled into his hidden ca\u00f1on that afternoon. A frost seared, fur clad\nfigure, red eyed from the wind and loss of sleep. A lone figure in a\nvast white world. Cold, hungry, craving whisky as a man on a parched\ndesert craves water. With a fortune tied in a gunnysack. Two fresh\nnotches on the bone handle of a short barreled Colt .45. A laugh\nrattling in his throat.\n\nHay in the barn. Pete had put up that hay. The spring above the cabin\nwas warm. It never froze. Had an iron taste to it.\n\nSam Graybull watered and fed his gaunt horse. While no law of God or man\nhad weight with the killer, he never violated that creed of the range\nthat commands its men to care for a horse that has carried a man. After\nthat he may look to his own comfort.\n\nSam Graybull found the whisky keg buried under the hay. He found a tin\ncup, and with a corner of his fur coat he wiped some of the dust from\ninside it. Then he squatted there by the keg and drank a cup of whisky\nas if the stuff were water. He sat there for better than half an hour.\nDrinking until the ache thawed from his bones and the hunger pains left\nhis empty stomach. Now and then he laughed. The horse would give a start\nand look around, ears erect. Sam Graybull\u2019s laugh was unlike the\nlaughter of any other man because there was no humor in it. More like a\ndeath rattle.\n\nHe was steady enough on his feet when he got up and went to the cabin.\nAs steady as a man can be when he has been frozen into the saddle for a\nnight and a day, and when he is bundled in fur coat and chaps and four\nbuckle overshoes.\n\n\u201cFill a jug and go visit Pete Peralta. To hell with cookin\u2019. Pete\u2019s\nmissus\u2019ll sling up some grub.\u201d His cracked, frost blackened lips split\nin a grin as he saw smoke coming from the Peralta cabin, across the\nriver among the skeleton cottonwoods.\n\nHe found a jug and filled it. Then he kicked off his chaps and located a\npair of snowshoes. It was as easy goin\u2019 afoot as it was a-horseback. He\nslung the jug about his shoulder with a bit of rope. Then he took his\ncarbine and fitted it into a worn buckskin sheath.\n\n\u201cWhisky. Ca\u2019tridges. All set.\u201d Then he remembered the money in the\ngunnysack. \u201cWhisky\u2019s takin\u2019 holt.\u201d He hid the money in the hay. Then,\nshuffling along on his webs, he crossed the river to Pete Peralta\u2019s\nplace.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nEven before he rapped on the door, Sam Graybull sensed that something\nwas wrong at the home of Pete Peralta. Horses in the hay corral,\nnibbling from the snow capped stack. Gate down. No tracks around.\nCattle, gaunt flanked and hollow eyed, bawling for water in the lower\npasture. Woodpile buried in the snow. Yet there was smoke coming from\nthe chimney. A light inside, against the coming dusk.\n\n\u201cCome in!\u201d Was that the voice of Pete Peralta? Sam could not see through\nthe window. Frost had made the panes opaque.\n\nCautiously Sam Graybull opened the door. His jug and carbine laid aside,\nhe held his Colt in his hand, the hammer thumbed back. He kicked the\ndoor open.\n\nFor a moment Sam Graybull stood there, half crouched, ready. Then he\nstraightened. The gun hammer lowered gently and the weapon went back\ninto its holster.\n\nFor propped up on a bunk beside the stove, one leg in rude splints, sat\nPete Peralta. A hollow eyed, gaunt cheeked, unshaven Pete.\n\n\u201cSam! Sam Graybull!\u201d His voice was like the hoarse call of a crow. But\nthere was a prayer in its welcome, as he voiced the name of the killer.\n\nFrom the bedroom beyond came a broken, moaning sob. A woman\u2019s sob. A\nwoman half delirious with pain.\n\n\u201cHorse fell and busted my leg . . . About a week ago . . . Rose took\ncare of me until she had to quit . . . She's goin' to have a baby--and\nno doctor inside a hundred miles. I reckon she\u2019ll die.\u201d\n\nIt took Sam Graybull some seconds to comprehend fully. A pint or more of\nraw whisky on an empty stomach does not make for quiet thinking. The\nfact that he could retain even a semblance of his faculties proved the\ntoughness of the killer.\n\n\u201cDoctor, eh?\u201d Sam Graybull pushed back his muskrat cap and ran blunt\nfingers through his shock of coarse black hair. \u201cDoctor? Yeah, you sure\nneed one, don\u2019t you, Pete?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot me, Sam. Her. She\u2019s out of her head, kinda.\u201d\n\n\u201cDyin\u2019, Pete?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe will, I reckon. There has to be a doctor when a baby comes.\u201d\n\nSam Graybull passed his hand across his eyes. He knew nothing of\nchildbirth. There had never been room in his killer\u2019s heart for sympathy\nfor man or woman. Life and the losing of life meant but little to him.\nHe nodded, black brows knit in a thoughtful scowl. Then he stepped\noutside and brought in the jug.\n\nHe poured three drinks into tin cups.\n\n\u201cDo us all good, Pete. Then we\u2019ll kinda figger this thing out.\u201d He took\none of the cups and went into the next room.\n\n\u201cHowdy, Rose. Git outside o\u2019 this. Nothin\u2019 like it to kill pain.\u201d\n\nDimly, through eyes that were mere slits of red, he saw the white face\nof the girl. White as the pillow against the mass of black hair. He\nlifted her head and held the cup against the lips that seemed drained of\nblood.\n\n\u201cThe pain--the pain. . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHell, ain\u2019t it? But that drink\u2019ll do you good.\u201d\n\nHe went back into the other room and handed Pete his cup.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s luck, Pete. Down \u2019er. More where that come from.\u201d\n\nSam gulped down his drink without a grimace. His brain seemed to be\nclearing.\n\n\u201cWhere do you keep your pencil and paper, Pete?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat shelf. God, Sam, if we could only do somethin\u2019 to help her.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep your shirt on.\u201d Sam found the writing pad and pencil. He handed\nthem to the crippled man.\n\n\u201cWrite a note to the doctor, Pete. Tell it scary.\u201d Sam pulled on his cap\nagain. \u201cI\u2019ll be ready by the time you git it wrote.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere you goin\u2019, Sam?\u201d\n\n\u201cOut to saddle up the best horse you got. I\u2019m goin\u2019 fer the doctor. I\u2019ll\nstop by the nearest ranch and have \u2019em send over somebody to ride herd\non you.\u201d The door banged shut behind him.\n\nSam caught Pete\u2019s best horse. When he had saddled the animal, he came\nback inside.\n\n\u201cGot that note finished?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. But you can\u2019t make it into town, Sam.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hell I can\u2019t. The storm\u2019s quit. I know the road, and I ain\u2019t so\ndrunk but what I kin ride. Lemme have that pencil.\u201d\n\nHe scrawled something at the foot of the note. Then he folded the paper\nand put it into his pocket.\n\n\u201cHang and rattle, Pete, till the doc gits here.\u201d He poured some of the\nwhisky into an empty vinegar bottle and put the corked bottle into his\novercoat. Then he filled the two cups.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s how, Pete. If the kid looks like you, I shore feel sorry fer the\ncritter.\u201d\n\nSam tossed down his drink and before Pete Peralta could say a word, he\nwas gone.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nIt was almighty hard luck, the way things had turned out for a man. When\nthe only friend a man had was laid up with a busted laig and a sick\nwife. No \u201cRed River Jig\u201d. No fire to set by. No Pete to talk to and tell\nhow comical that bank dude looked when he dropped. No warm grub. Only\nthat bottle. Better drop past the cabin and fill a jug. When a man ain\u2019t\nslept ner et he\u2019d orter have a jug along to keep him alive.\n\nHe stopped at his cabin long enough to fill the jug. Then he pulled out.\nHe rode into a Long X line camp. A slit eyed, frost blackened man who\nstaggered a little when he walked. The two cowpunchers stared hard at\nhim.\n\n\u201cPeter Peralta\u2019s in bad shape. Broke a laig. His missus is dyin\u2019. I\u2019m\nridin\u2019 fer a doctor. One o\u2019 you boys git over there and look after\nthings.\u201d\n\nHe wolfed some meat and beans and gave them a shot out of his jug. One\nof the cowpunchers was getting ready for the trip to Pete\u2019s. Sam\nGraybull climbed back into the saddle and rode on.\n\nThe storm had quit. The stars glittered like white sparks against the\nclear sky. The moon pushed up over the ragged ridges. Sam Graybull\nswayed a little as he rode, half asleep, half awake, back along the\ntrail to town.\n\nHe took some tobacco and rubbed it into his eyes to sting them open. Now\nand then he took a drink from the jug. Not as big a drink as he wanted.\nJust enough to keep a man alive. That grub made a man sleepy. A paunch\nfull of meat always made a man sleepy. Almighty hard luck that a man\ncouldn\u2019t git off and lay down. For five minutes. Yeah. Five hours. Be\nfroze stiff as a stick. Hadn\u2019t he froze his feet thataway? Wouldn\u2019t he\na-died there only Pete come by? Hell, he was payin\u2019 Pete back right now.\nA man paid his debts thataway. Took guts, too. But when a man\u2019s got one\nfriend on earth, he\u2019d be a hell of a kind of man not to lend a hand. It\ntook guts. Somethin\u2019 Pete didn\u2019t have. Pete was a chicken hearted cuss.\nWith his wife and his fiddle. Never taken a chance. Never would get\nnowhere. Like a cow pasture. A muley cow. Well, no man had ever sawed\nSam Graybull\u2019s horns. No fence made ever held him. No jail, neither.\nNever bin ketched. Them as tried it had some hard luck. Have a drink.\nDamn that cork. A man\u2019s hands stiff and numb. There she comes. Good\nwhisky. Thawed a man\u2019s belly. Fightin\u2019 whisky.\n\nSam Graybull\u2019s laugh grated on the silence of the winter night. There\u2019d\nbe fightin\u2019 a-plenty if a man run into that fool posse. Sam took a\nbeaded buckskin pouch and put into it the note to the doctor. Then he\nfastened the pouch around his neck outside his coat. He moved with a\ndogged, sluggish precision. Like a machine that needs oil. He lost one\nof his mittens. The right mitten. He put the other mitten on his right\nhand, leaving the left one bare. Sam Graybull\u2019s right hand was his gun\nhand.\n\nOut of the hills and onto the main road to town. Daylight now. Sleepy.\nDozing in the saddle. Ridin\u2019 that horse like he owned him. Payin\u2019 off\nthe only debt he owed to his only friend.\n\nYonder was Beaver Crick. Old gray wolf a-comin\u2019 outa the bare willers.\nWith a belly full of meat, headin\u2019 fer a safe place to sleep it off. Sam\nnever killed a wolf. Hell, he was a wolf, hisself. A he-wolf. A killer.\nNo rabbit, like Pete Peralta. Pete, whinin\u2019 over a busted laig. What\u2019d\nhe do if he had a .30-.40 slug in him and had to gouge it out with a\njacknife? Sam Graybull had done that.\n\nWhat\u2019s a-comin\u2019 yonder? Horsebackers. A dozen er more. Posse men. Time\nfer a drink. A big\u2019n this time. No nibble. Bin holdin\u2019 off. Waitin\u2019.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s lookin\u2019 at you boys!\u201d Sam Graybull\u2019s hoarse voice carried a note\nof triumph. \u201cHere\u2019s lookin\u2019 at you acrost gun sights!\u201d And he left the\nfiery stuff gurgle down his throat.\n\nA rifle bullet whined past Sam Graybull\u2019s head. He taunted the marksman\nwith a yell of derision and, tossing aside the jug, jerked his carbine\nand rode at a run straight for the men.\n\nA hail of bullets met his rush. Sam Graybull\u2019s horse somersaulted, shot\nbetween the eyes. Sam tried to kick his feet from the stirrups. Too\nlate. Horse and man crashed together. A dull pain shot through the\nkiller\u2019s leg. That leg was pinned under the dead weight of the horse.\nBullets spatted and droned. Sam Graybull emptied his carbine. Two of the\nposse felt the searing sting of the outlaw\u2019s bullets. Sam pulled his\nsix-gun--the .45 that had taken deadly toll of human life. His thumb\nfanned the hammer.\n\n\u201cCome an\u2019 git it! Come on, you red necks!\u201d\n\nBlack lips bared from tobacco stained teeth. Slit eyes swollen almost\nshut. It took guts.\n\nSomething white hot stabbed Sam Graybull\u2019s chest. He hardly felt it.\nAbove the flat spat of rifles in the dawn, sounded the mirthless laugh\nof Sam Graybull. A laugh that sounded like the death rattle. Tumbing the\nhammer of an empty gun. Then the weary head dropped back into the snow.\nSam Graybull, killer, was dead.\n\nThe last of the whisky gurgled out of the uncorked jug into the trail.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201cHe must have got drunk, blind drunk, and lost his way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sheriff pulled the dead outlaw clear of the horse. Grimly\ntriumphant, the grizzled old officer examined the body of the killer.\nThen he opened the pouch and found the note.\n\nAs he read it, there in the sunrise of that winter morning, the warm\nglow of victory chilled. He turned to a man who carried a small black\nbag instead of a gun.\n\n\u201cThis is fer you, Doc. You\u2019re wanted down on the river.\u201d He handed over\nthe note. Then he turned to his men.\n\n\u201cHandle Sam easy, boys. He come back a-purpose, to do the only decent\nthing he ever done in his life. Pete Peralta\u2019s wife is about to have a\nbaby. Sam Graybull come to fetch Doc. Handle \u2019im easy.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff and Doc Steele rode along the trail together. Doc read aloud\nthe postscript to Pete Peralta\u2019s note.\n\n      \u201cThe bank money is in a sack under the hay at my cabin.\n      What bounty there is on my hide goes to Pete Peralta.\n      If the kid\u2019s a boy, name him Graybull. Use the bounty\n      money to educate him. So long\u201d\n                                               --SAM GRAYBULL.\n\nAnd so it was that Doc Steele brought into the world a boy named\nGraybull Peralta. Some of the A.E.F. will remember him as Captain\nGraybull Peralta, the fighting chaplain of the --th Division, made up of\nmen from the cow country. He was killed in action in the Argonne. In the\npocket of his blouse was a bullet drilled, blood soaked Bible. In his\nhand was a bone handled six-gun with six notches filed on its age\nyellowed handle.\n\nMajor Steele, who found him, gently removed the empty gun from the dead\ncaptain\u2019s hand. He looked with memory misted eyes at the face of the\nfighting parson. The bared lips, the swollen, slitted eyes.\n\n\u201cHandle him gently, men,\u201d he told the stretcher bearers. \u201cGently, as we\nhandled his father twenty years ago. May the son of Sam Graybull find\nfat meat in the Shadow Hills!\u201d\n\nAnd they were too busy, those stretcher bearers, to wonder at the queer\nwords of the white haired surgeon.",
