    "body": "Herbert Hyrel settled himself more comfortably in his easy chair,\nextended his short legs further toward the fireplace, and let his eyes\ntravel cautiously in the general direction of his wife.\n\nShe was in her chair as usual, her long legs curled up beneath her, the\nupper half of her face hidden in the bulk of her personalized,\nthree-dimensional telovis. The telovis, of a stereoscopic nature,\nseemingly brought the performers with all their tinsel and color\ndirectly into the room of the watcher.\n\nHyrel had no way of seeing into the plastic affair she wore, but he\nguessed from the expression on the lower half of her face that she was\nwatching one of the newer black-market sex-operas. In any event, there\nwould be no sound, movement, or sign of life from her for the next three\nhours. To break the thread of the play for even a moment would ruin all\nthe previous emotional build-up.\n\nThere had been a time when he hated her for those long and silent\nevenings, lonely hours during which he was completely ignored. It was\ndifferent now, however, for those hours furnished him with time for an\nescape of his own.\n\nHis lips curled into a tight smile and his right hand fondled the\nunobtrusive switch beneath his trouser leg. He did not press the switch.\nHe would wait a few minutes longer. But it was comforting to know that\nit was there, exhilarating to know that he could escape for a few hours\nby a mere flick of his finger.\n\nHe let his eyes stray to the dim light of the artificial flames in the\nfireplace. His hate for her was not bounded merely by those lonely hours\nshe had forced upon him. No, it was far more encompassing.\n\nHe hated her with a deep, burning savagery that was deadly in its\npassion. He hated her for her money, the money she kept securely from\nhim. He hated her for the paltry allowance she doled out to him, as if\nhe were an irresponsible child. It was as if she were constantly\nreminding him in every glance and gesture, \"I made a bad bargain when I\nmarried you. You wanted me, my money, everything, and had nothing to\ngive in return except your own doltish self. You set a trap for me,\nbaited with lies and a false front. Now you are caught in your own trap\nand will remain there like a mouse to eat from my hand whatever crumbs I\nstoop to give you.\"\n\nBut some day his hate would be appeased. Yes, some day soon he would\nkill her!\n\nHe shot a sideways glance at her, wondering if by chance she\nsuspected.... She hadn't moved. Her lips were pouted into a half smile;\nthe sex-opera had probably reached one of its more pleasurable moments.\n\nHyrel let his eyes shift back to the fireplace again. Yes, he would kill\nher. Then he would claim a rightful share of her money, be rid of her\ndebasing dominance.\n\n\n\nHe let the thought run around through his head, savoring it with mental\ntaste buds. He would not kill her tonight. No, nor the next night. He\nwould wait, wait until he had sucked the last measure of pleasure from\nthe thought.\n\nIt was like having a bottle of rare old wine on a shelf where it could\nbe viewed daily. It was like being able to pause again and again before\nthe bottle, hold it up to the light, and say to it, \"Some day, when my\ndesire for you has reached the ultimate, I shall unstopper you quietly\nand sip you slowly to the last soul-satisfying drop.\" As long as the\nbottle remained there upon the shelf it was symbolic of that pleasurable\nmoment....\n\nHe snapped out of his reverie and realized he had been wasting precious\nmoments. There would be time enough tomorrow for gloating. Tonight,\nthere were other things to do. Pleasurable things. He remembered the\ngirl he had met the night before, and smiled smugly. Perhaps she would\nbe awaiting him even now. If not, there would be another one....\n\nHe settled himself deeper into the chair, glanced once more at his wife,\nthen let his head lean comfortably back against the chair's headrest.\nHis hand upon his thigh felt the thin mesh that cloaked his body beneath\nhis clothing like a sheer stocking. His fingers went again to the tiny\nswitch. Again he hesitated.\n\nHerbert Hyrel knew no more about the telporter suit he wore than he did\nabout the radio in the corner, the TV set against the wall, or the\npersonalized telovis his wife was wearing. You pressed one of the\nbuttons on the radio; music came out. You pressed a button and clicked a\ndial on the TV; music and pictures came out. You pressed a button and\nmade an adjustment on the telovis; three-dimensional, emotion-colored\npictures leaped into the room. You pressed a tiny switch on the\ntelporter suit; you were whisked away to a receiving set you had\npreviously set up in secret.\n\nHe knew that the music and the images of the performers on the TV and\ntelovis were brought to his room by some form of electrical impulse\nor wave while the actual musicians and performers remained in the\nstudio. He knew that when he pressed the switch on his thigh something\nwithin him--his ectoplasm, higher self, the thing spirits use for\nmaterialization, whatever its real name--streamed out of him along an\ninvisible channel, leaving his body behind in the chair in a conscious\nbut dream-like state. His other self materialized in a small cabin in a\nhidden nook between a highway and a river where he had installed the\nreceiving set a month ago.\n\nHe thought once more of the girl who might be waiting for him, smiled,\nand pressed the switch.\n\n\n\nThe dank air of the cabin was chill to Herbert Hyrel's naked flesh. He\nfumbled through the darkness for the clothing he kept there, found his\nshorts and trousers, got hurriedly into them, then flicked on a pocket\nlighter and ignited a stub of candle upon the table. By the wavering\nlight, he finished dressing in the black satin clothing, the white\nshirt, the flowing necktie and tam. He invoiced the contents of his\nbillfold. Not much. And his monthly pittance was still two weeks\naway....\n\nHe had skimped for six months to salvage enough money from his allowance\nto make a down payment on the telporter suit. Since then, his\nexpenses--monthly payments for the suit, cabin rent, costly liquor--had\nforced him to place his nights of escape on strict ration. He could not\ngo on this way, he realized. Not now. Not since he had met the girl. He\nhad to have more money. Perhaps he could not afford the luxury of\nleaving the wine bottle longer upon the shelf....\n\nRiverside Club, where Hyrel arrived by bus and a hundred yards of\nwalking, was exclusive. It catered to a clientele that had but three\nthings in common: money, a desire for utter self-abandonment, and a\nsales slip indicating ownership of a telporter suit. The club was of\nnecessity expensive, for self-telportation was strictly illegal, and\npolice protection came high.\n\nHerbert Hyrel adjusted his white, silken mask carefully at the door and\nshoved his sales slip through a small aperture where it was thoroughly\nscanned by unseen eyes. A buzzer sounded an instant later, the lock on\nthe door clicked, and Hyrel pushed through into the exhilarating warmth\nof music and laughter.\n\nThe main room was large. Hidden lights along the walls sent slow beams\nof red, blue, vermillion, green, yellow and pink trailing across the\ndomed ceiling in a heterogeneous pattern. The colored beams mingled,\ndiffused, spread, were caught up by mirrors of various tints which\ndiffused and mingled the lights once more until the whole effect was an\never-changing panorama of softly-melting shades.\n\nThe gay and bizarre costumes of the masked revelers on the dance floor\nand at the tables, unearthly in themselves, were made even more so by\nthe altering light. Music flooded the room from unseen sources.\nLaughter--hysterical, drunken, filled with utter abandonment--came from\nthe dance floor, the tables, and the private booths and rooms hidden\ncleverly within the walls.\n\nHyrel pushed himself to an unoccupied table, sat down and ordered a\nbottle of cheap whiskey. He would have preferred champagne, but his\ndepleted finances forbade the more discriminate taste.\n\nWhen his order arrived, he poured a glass tumbler half full and consumed\nit eagerly while his eyes scanned the room in search of the girl. He\ncouldn't see her in the dim swirl of color. Had she arrived? Perhaps she\nwas wearing a different costume than she had the night before. If so,\nrecognition might prove difficult.\n\nHe poured himself another drink, promising himself he would go in search\nof her when the liquor began to take effect.\n\nA woman clad in the revealing garb of a Persian dancer threw an arm\nabout him from behind and kissed him on the cheek through the veil which\ncovered the lower part of her face.\n\n\"Hi, honey,\" she giggled into his ear. \"Havin' a time?\"\n\nHe reached for the white arm to pull her to him, but she eluded his\ngrasp and reeled away into the waiting arms of a tall toreador. Hyrel\ngulped his whiskey and watched her nestle into the arms of her partner\nand begin with him a sinuous, suggestive dance. The whiskey had begun\nits warming effect, and he laughed.\n\nThis was the land of the lotus eaters, the sanctuary of the escapists,\nthe haven of all who wished to cast off their shell of inhibition and\nbecome the thing they dreamed themselves to be. Here one could be among\nhis own kind, an actor upon a gay stage, a gaudy butterfly metamorphosed\nfrom the slug, a knight of old.\n\nThe Persian dancing girl was probably the wife of a boorish oaf whose\nidea of romance was spending an evening telling his wife how he came to\nbe a successful bank president. But she had found her means of escape.\nPerhaps she had pleaded a sick headache and had retired to her room. And\nthere upon the bed now reposed her shell of reality while her inner\nself, the shadowy one, completely materialized, became an exotic thing\nfrom the East in this never-never land.\n\nThe man, the toreador, had probably closeted himself within his library\nwith a set of account books and had left strict orders not to be\ndisturbed until he had finished with them.\n\nBoth would have terrific hangovers in the morning. But that, of course,\nwould be fully compensated for by the memories of the evening.\n\nHyrel chuckled. The situation struck him as being funny: the shadowy\nself got drunk and had a good time, and the outer husk suffered the\nhangover in the morning. Strange. Strange how a device such as the\ntelporter suit could cause the shadow of each bodily cell to leave the\nbody, materialize, and become a reality in its own right. And yet ...\n\n\n\nHe looked at the heel of his left hand. There was a long, irregular scar\nthere. It was the result of a cut he had received nearly three weeks ago\nwhen he had fallen over this very table and had rammed his hand into a\nsliver of broken champagne glass. Later that evening, upon re-telporting\nback home, the pain of the cut had remained in his hand, but there was\nno sign of the cut itself on the hand of his outer self. The scar was\npeculiar to the shadowy body only. There was something about the shadowy\nbody that carried the hurts to the outer body, but not the scars....\n\nSudden laughter broke out near him, and he turned quickly in that\ndirection. A group of gaily costumed revelers was standing in a\nsemi-circle about a small mound of clothing upon the floor. It was the\ncostume of the toreador.\n\nHyrel laughed, too. It had happened many times before--a costume\nsuddenly left empty as its owner, due to a threat of discovery at home,\nhad had to press the switch in haste to bring his shadowy self--and\ncomplete consciousness--back to his outer self in a hurry.\n\nA waiter picked up the clothing. He would put it safely away so that the\nowner could claim it upon his next visit to the club. Another waiter\nplaced a fresh bottle of whiskey on the table before Hyrel, and Hyrel\npaid him for it.\n\nThe whiskey, reaching his head now in surges of warm cheerfulness, was\nfilling him with abandonment, courage, and a desire for merriment. He\npushed himself up from the table, joined the merry throng, threw his arm\nabout the Persian dancer, drew her close.\n\nThey began dancing slowly to the throbbing rhythm, dancing and holding\non to each other tightly. Hyrel could feel her hot breath through her\nveil upon his neck, adding to the headiness of the liquor. His feeling\nof depression and inferiority flowed suddenly from him. Once again he\nwas the all-conquering male.\n\nHis arm trembled as it drew her still closer to him and he began dancing\ndirectly and purposefully toward the shadows of a clump of artificial\npalms near one corner of the room. There was an exit to the garden\nbehind the palms.\n\nHalf way there they passed a secluded booth from which protruded a long\nleg clad in black mesh stocking. Hyrel paused as he recognized that part\nof the costume. It was she! The girl! The one he had met so briefly the\nnight before!\n\nHis arm slid away from the Persian dancer, took hold of the mesh-clad\nleg, and pulled. A female form followed the leg from the booth and fell\ninto his arms. He held her tightly, kissed her white neck, let her\nperfume send his thoughts reeling.\n\n\"Been looking for me, honey?\" she whispered, her voice deep and throaty.\n\n\"You know it!\"\n\nHe began whisking her away toward the palms. The Persian girl was\npulled into the booth.\n\nYes, she was wearing the same costume she had worn the night before,\nthat of a can-can dancer of the 90's. The mesh hose that encased her\nshapely legs were held up by flowered supporters in such a manner as to\nleave four inches of white leg exposed between hose top and lacy\npanties. Her skirt, frilled to suggest innumerable petticoats, fell away\nat each hip, leaving the front open to expose the full length of legs.\nShe wore a wig of platinum hair encrusted with jewels that sparkled in\nthe lights. Her jewel-studded mask was as white as her hair and covered\nthe upper half of her face, except for the large almond slits for her\neyes. A white purse, jewel crusted, dangled from one arm.\n\nHe stopped once before reaching the palms, drew her closer, kissed her\nlong and ardently. Then he began pulling her on again.\n\nShe drew back when they reached the shelter of the fronds. \"Champagne,\nfirst,\" she whispered huskily into his ear.\n\nHis heart sank. He had very little money left. Well, it might buy a\ncheap brand....\n\n\n\nShe sipped her champagne slowly and provocatively across the table from\nhim. Her eyes sparkled behind the almond slits of her mask, caught the\ncolor changes and cast them back. She was wearing contact lenses of a\ngarish green.\n\nHe wished she would hurry with her drink. He had horrible visions of his\nwife at home taking off her telovis and coming to his chair. He would\nthen have to press the switch that would jerk his shadowy self back\nalong its invisible connecting cord, jerk him back and leave but a small\nmound of clothes upon the chair at the table.\n\nDeep depression laid hold of him. He would not be able to see her after\ntonight until he received his monthly dole two weeks hence. She wouldn't\nwait that long. Someone else would have her.\n\nUnless ...\n\nYes, he knew now that he was going to kill his wife as soon as the\nopportunity presented itself. It would be a simple matter. With the aid\nof the telporter suit, he could establish an iron-clad alibi.\n\nHe took a long drink of whiskey and looked at the dancers about him.\nSight of their gay costumes heightened his depression. He was wearing a\ncheap suit of satin, all he could afford. But some day soon he would\nshow them! Some time soon he would be dressed as gaily....\n\n\"Something troubling you, honey?\"\n\nHis gaze shot back to her and she blurred slightly before his eyes. \"No.\nNothing at all!\" He summoned a sickly smile and clutched her hand in\nhis. \"Come on. Let's dance.\"\n\nHe drew her from the chair and into his arms. She melted toward him as\nif desiring to become a part of him. A tremor of excitement surged\nthrough him and threatened to turn his knees into quivering jelly. He\ncould not make his feet conform to the flooding rhythm of the music. He\nhalf stumbled, half pushed her along past the booths.\n\nIn the shelter of the palms he drew her savagely to him. \"Let's--let's\ngo outside.\" His voice was little more than a croak.\n\n\"But, honey!\" She pushed herself away, her low voice maddening him.\n\"Don't you have a private room? A girl doesn't like to be taken\noutside....\"\n\nHer words bit into his brain like the blade of a hot knife.\n\nNo, he didn't have a private room at the club like the others. A private\nroom for his telporter receiver, a private room where he could take a\nwilling guest. No! He couldn't afford it! No! _No!_ NO! His lot was a\ncheap suit of satin! Cheap whiskey! Cheap champagne! A cheap shack by\nthe river....\n\nAn inarticulate cry escaped his twisted lips. He clutched her roughly to\nhim and dragged her through the door and into the moonlight, whiskey and\nanger lending him brutal strength.\n\nHe pulled her through the deserted garden. _All the others had private\nrooms!_ He pulled her to the far end, behind a clump of squatty firs.\nHis hands clawed at her. He tried to smother her mouth with kisses.\n\nShe eluded him deftly. \"But, _honey_!\" Her voice had gone deeper into\nher throat. \"I just want to be sure about things. If you can't afford\none of the private rooms--if you can't afford to show me a good time--if\nyou can't come here real often ...\"\n\nThe whiskey pounded and throbbed at his brain like blows from an unseen\nclub. His ego curled and twisted within him like a headless serpent.\n\n\"I'll have money!\" he shouted, struggling to hold her. \"I'll have plenty\nof money! After tonight!\"\n\n\"Then we'll wait,\" she said. \"We'll wait until tomorrow night.\"\n\n\"No!\" he screamed. \"You don't believe me! You're like the others! You\nthink I'm no good! But I'll show you! I'll show all of you!\"\n\n\n\nShe had gone coldly rigid in his arms, unyielding.\n\nMadness added to the pounding in his brain. Tears welled into his eyes.\n\n\"I'll show you! I'll kill her! Then I'll have money!\" The hands\nclutching her shoulders shook her drunkenly. \"You wait here! I'll go\nhome and kill her now! Then I'll be back!\"\n\n\"Silly boy!\" Her low laughter rang hollowly in his ears. \"And just who\nis it you are going to kill?\"\n\n\"My wife!\" he cried. \"My wife! I'll ...\"\n\nA sudden sobering thought struck him. He was talking too much. And he\nwasn't making sense. He shouldn't be telling her this. Anyway, he\ncouldn't get the money tonight even if he did kill his wife.\n\n\"And so you are going to kill your wife....\"\n\nHe blinked the tears from his eyes. His chest was heaving, his heart\npounding. He looked at her shimmering form. \"Y-yes,\" he whispered.\n\nHer eyes glinted strangely in the light of the moon. Her handbag glinted\nas she opened it, and something she took from it glittered coldly in\nher hand.\n\n\"Fool!\"\n\nThe first shot tore squarely through his heart. And while he stood\nstaring at her, mouth agape, a second shot burned its way through his\nbewildered brain.\n\n\n\nMrs. Herbert Hyrel removed the telovis from her head and laid it\ncarefully aside. She uncoiled her long legs from beneath her, walked to\nher husband's chair, and stood for a long moment looking down at him,\nher lips drawn back in contempt. Then she bent over him and reached down\nhis thigh until her fingers contacted the small switch.\n\nSeconds later, a slight tremor shook Hyrel's body. His eyes snapped\nopen, air escaped his lungs, his lower jaw sagged inanely, and his head\nlolled to one side.\n\nShe stood a moment longer, watching his eyes become glazed and\nsightless. Then she walked to the telephone.\n\n\"Police?\" she said. \"This is Mrs. Herbert Hyrel. Something horrible has\nhappened to my husband. Please come over immediately. Bring a doctor.\"\n\nShe hung up, went to her bathroom, stripped off her clothing, and slid\ncarefully out of her telporter suit. This she folded neatly and tucked\naway into the false back of the medicine cabinet. She found a fresh pair\nof blue, plastifur pajamas and got into them.\n\nShe was just arriving back into the living room, tying the cord of her\ndressing gown about her slim waist, when she heard the sound of the\npolice siren out front.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n",
