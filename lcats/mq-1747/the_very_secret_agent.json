    "body": "In their ship just beyond the orbit of Mars the two aliens sat looking\nat each other.\n\n\"No,\" Riuku said. \"I haven't had any luck. And I can tell you right\nnow that I'm not going to have any, and no one else is going to have\nany either. The Earthmen are too well shielded.\"\n\n\"You contacted the factory?\" Nagor asked.\n\n\"Easily. It's the right one. The parking lot attendant knows there's a\nnew weapon being produced in there. The waitress at the Jumbo Burger\nGrill across the street knows it. Everybody I reached knows it. But\nnot one knows anything about what it is.\"\n\nNagor looked out through the ports of the spaceship, which didn't in\nthe least resemble an Earth spaceship, any more than what Nagor\nconsidered sight resembled the corresponding Earth sense perception.\nHe frowned.\n\n\"What about the research scientists? We know who some of them are. The\nsupervisors? The technicians?\"\n\n\"No,\" Riuku said flatly. \"They're shielded. Perfectly I can't make\ncontact with a single mind down there that has the faintest inkling of\nwhat's going on. We never should have let them develop the shield.\"\n\n\"Have you tried contacting everyone? What about the workers?\"\n\n\"Shielded. All ten thousand of them. Of course I haven't checked all\nof them yet, but--\"\n\n\"Do it,\" Nagor said grimly. \"We've got to find out what that weapon\nis. Or else get out of this solar system.\"\n\nRiuku sighed. \"I'll try,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSomeone put another dollar in the juke box, and the theremins started\nin on Mare Indrium Mary for the tenth time since Pete Ganley had come\ninto the bar. \"Aw shut up,\" he said, wishing there was some way to\nturn them off. Twelve-ten. Alice got off work at Houston's at twelve.\nShe ought to be here by now. She would be, if it weren't Thursday.\nShield boosting night for her.\n\nWhy, he asked himself irritably, couldn't those scientists figure out\nsome way to keep the shields up longer than a week? Or else why didn't\nthey have boosting night the same for all departments? He had to stay\nlate every Friday and Alice every Thursday, and all the time there was\nSusan at home ready to jump him if he wasn't in at a reasonable\ntime....\n\n\"Surprised, Pete?\" Alice Hendricks said at his elbow.\n\nHe swung about, grinned at her. \"Am I? You said it. And here I was\nabout to go. I never thought you'd make it before one.\" His grin faded\na little. \"How'd you do it? Sweet-talk one of the guards into letting\nyou in at the head of the line?\"\n\nShe shook her bandanaed head, slid onto the stool beside him and\ncrossed her knees--a not very convincing sign of femininity in a woman\nwearing baggy denim coveralls. \"Aren't you going to buy me a drink,\nhoney?\"\n\n\"Oh, sure.\" He glanced over at the bartender. \"Another beer. No, make\nit two.\" He pulled the five dollars out of his pocket, shoved it\nacross the bar, and looked back at Alice, more closely this time. The\nID badge, pinned to her hip. The badge, with her name, number,\ndepartment, and picture--and the little meter that measured the\nstrength of her Mind Shield.\n\nThe dial should have pointed to full charge. It didn't. It registered\nabout seventy per cent loss.\n\nAlice followed his gaze. She giggled. \"It was easy,\" she said. \"The\nguards don't do more than glance at us, you know. And everyone who's\nsupposed to go through Shielding on Thursday has the department number\nstamped on a yellow background. So all I did was make a red\nbackground, like yours, and slip it on in the restroom at Clean-up\ntime.\"\n\n\"But Alice....\" Pete Ganley swallowed his beer and signaled for\nanother. \"This is serious. You've got to keep the shields up. The\nenemy is everywhere. Why, right now, one could be probing you.\"\n\n\"So what? The dial isn't down to Danger yet. And tomorrow I'll just\nput the red tag back on over the yellow one and go through Shielding\nin the same line with you. They won't notice.\" She giggled again. \"I\nthought it was smart, Petey. You oughta think so too. You know why I\ndid it, don't you?\"\n\nHer round, smooth face looked up at him, wide-eyed and full-lipped.\nShe had no worry wrinkles like Susan's, no mouth pulled down at the\ncorners like Susan's, and under that shapeless coverall....\n\n\"Sure, baby, I'm glad you did it,\" Pete Ganley said huskily.\n\nRiuku was glad too, the next afternoon when the swing shift started\npouring through the gates.\n\nIt was easy, once he'd found her. He had tested hundreds, all\nshielded, some almost accessible to him, but none vulnerable enough.\nThen this one came. The shield was so far down that contact was almost\neasy. Painful, tiring, but not really difficult. He could feel her\nmomentary sense of alarm, of nausea, and then he was through,\nintegrated with her, his thoughts at home with her thoughts.\n\nHe rested, inside her mind.\n\n\"Oh, hi, Joan. No, I'm all right. Just a little dizzy for a moment. A\nhangover? Of course not. Not on a Friday.\"\n\nRiuku listened to her half of the conversation. Stupid Earthman. If\nonly she'd start thinking about the job. Or if only his contact with\nher were better. If he could use her sense perceptions, see through\nher eyes, hear through her ears, feel through her fingers, then\neverything would be easy. But he couldn't. All he could do was read\nher thoughts. Earth thoughts at that....\n\n_... The time clock. Where's my card? Oh, here it is. Only 3:57. Why\ndid I have to hurry so? I had lots of time...._\n\n\"Why, Mary, how nice you look today. That's a new hairdo, isn't it? A\npermanent? Yeah, what kind?\" _... What a microbe! Looks like pink\nstraw, her hair does, and of course she thinks it's beautiful...._\n\"I'd better get down to my station. Old Liverlips will be ranting\nagain. You oughta be glad you have Eddie for a lead man. Eddie's cute.\nSo's Dave, over in 77. But Liverlips, ugh....\"\n\nShe was walking down the aisle to her station now. A procession of\nnames: _Maisie, and Edith, and that fat slob Natalie, and if Jean\nAndrews comes around tonight flashing that diamond in my face again,\nI'll--I'll kill her...._\n\n\"Oh hello, Clinton. What do you mean, late? The whistle just blew. Of\ncourse I'm ready to go to work.\" _Liverlips, that's what you are. And\nstill in that same blue shirt. What a wife you must have. Probably as\nsloppy as you are...._\n\nGood, Riuku thought. Now she'll be working. Now he'd find out whatever\nit was she was doing. Not that it would be important, of course, but\nlet him learn what her job was, and what those other girls' jobs were,\nand in a little while he'd have all the data he needed. Maybe even\nbefore the shift ended tonight, before she went through the Shielding\nboost.\n\nHe shivered a little, thinking of the boost. He'd survive it, of\ncourse. He'd be too well integrated with her by then. But it was\nnothing to look forward to.\n\nStill, he needn't worry about it. He had the whole shift to find out\nwhat the weapon was. The whole shift, here inside Alice's mind, inside\nthe most closely guarded factory on or under or above the surface of\nthe Earth. He settled down and waited, expectantly.\n\nAlice Hendricks turned her back on the lead man and looked down the\nwork table to her place. The other girls were there already. Lois and\nMarge and Coralie, the other three members of the Plug table, Line 73.\n\n\"Hey, how'd you make out?\" Marge said. She glanced around to make sure\nnone of the lead men or timekeepers were close enough to overhear her,\nthen went on. \"Did you get away with it?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Alice said. \"And you should of seen Pete's face when I walked\nin.\"\n\nShe took the soldering iron out of her locker, plugged it in, and\nreached out for the pan of 731 wires. \"You know, it's funny. Pete's\nnot so good looking, and he's sort of a careless dresser and all that,\nbut oh, what he does to me.\" She filled the 731 plug with solder and\nreached for the white, black, red wire.\n\n\"You'd better watch out,\" Lois said. \"Or Susan's going to be doing\nsomething to you.\"\n\n\"Oh, her.\" Alice touched the tip of the iron to the solder filled pin,\nworked the wire down into position. \"What can she do? Pete doesn't\ngive a damn about her.\"\n\n\"He's still living with her, isn't he?\" Lois said.\n\nAlice shrugged.... _What a mealy-mouthed little snip Lois could be,\nsometimes. You'd think to hear her that she was better than any of\nthem, and luckier too, with her Joe and the kids. What a laugh! Joe\nwas probably the only guy who'd ever looked at her, and she'd hooked\nhim right out of school, and now with three kids in five years and her\nworking nights...._\n\nAlice finished soldering the first row of wires in the plug and\nstarted in on the second. So old Liverlips thought she wasted time,\ndid he? Well, she'd show him. She'd get out her sixteen plugs tonight.\n\n\"Junior kept me up all night last night,\" Lois said. \"He's cutting a\ntooth.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Coralie said, \"It's pretty rough at that age. I remember right\nafter Mike was born....\"\n\nDon't they ever think of anything but their kids? Alice thought. She\nstopped listening to them. She heard Pete's voice again, husky and\nsending little chills all through her, and his face came between her\nand the plug and the white green wire she was soldering. His face,\nwith those blue eyes that went right through a girl and that little\nscar that quirked up the corner of his mouth....\n\n\"Oh, oh,\" Alice said suddenly. \"I've got solder on the outside of the\npin.\" She looked around for the alcohol.\n\nRiuku probed. Her thoughts were easy enough to read, but just try to\ntranslate them into anything useful.... He probed deeper. The plugs\nshe was soldering. He could get a good picture of them, of the wires,\nof the harness lacing that Coralie was doing. But it meant nothing.\nThey could be making anything. Radios, monitor units, sound equipment.\n\nOnly they weren't. They were making a weapon, and this bit of\nelectronic equipment was part of that weapon. What part? What did the\n731 plug do?\n\nAlice Hendricks didn't know. Alice Hendricks didn't care.\n\nThe first break. Ten minutes away from work. Alice was walking back\nalong the aisle that separated Assembly from the men's Machine Shop. A\nchance, perhaps. She was looking at the machines, or rather past them,\nat the men.\n\n\"Hello, Tommy. How's the love life?\" He's not bad at all. Real cute.\nThough not like Pete, oh no.\n\nThe machines. Riuku prodded at her thoughts, wishing he could\ninfluence them, wishing that just for a moment he could see, hear,\nfeel, _think_ as she would never think.\n\nThe machines were--machines. That big funny one where Ned works, and\nTommy's spot welder, and over in the corner where the superintendent\nis--he's a snappy dresser, tie and everything.\n\nThe corner. Restricted area. Can't go over. High voltage or\nsomething....\n\nHer thoughts slid away from the restricted area. Should she go out for\nlunch or eat off the sandwich machine? And Riuku curled inside her\nmind and cursed her with his rapidly growing Earthwoman's vocabulary.\n\nAt the end of the shift he had learned nothing. Nothing about the\nweapon, that is. He had found out a good deal about the sex life of\nGenus Homo--information that made him even more glad than before that\nhis was a one-sexed race.\n\n\n\nWith work over and tools put away and Alice in the restroom gleefully\nthinking about the red Friday night tag she was slipping onto her ID\nbadge, he was as far from success as ever. For a moment he considered\nleaving her, looking for another subject. But he'd probably not be\nable to find one. No, the only thing to do was stay with her, curl\ndeep in her mind and go through the Shielding boost, and later on....\n\nThe line. Alice's nervousness.... _Oh, oh, there's that guy with the\nmeter--the one from maintenance. What's he want?_\n\n\"Whaddya mean, my shield's low? How could it be?\" _... If he checks\nthe tag I'll be fired for sure. It's a lot of nonsense anyway. The\nenemy is everywhere, they keep telling us. Whoever saw one of them?_\n\"No, honest, I didn't notice anything. Can I help it if.... It's okay,\nhuh? It'll pass....\"\n\nDown to fifteen per cent, the guy said. Well, that's safe, I guess.\nWhew.\n\n\"Oh, hello, Paula. Whatcha talking about, what am I doing here\ntonight? Shut up....\"\n\nAnd then, in the midst of her thoughts, the pain, driving deep into\nRiuku, twisting at him, wrenching at him, until there was no\nconsciousness of anything at all.\n\nHe struggled back. He was confused, and there was blankness around\nhim, and for a moment he thought he'd lost contact altogether. Then he\ncame into focus again. Alice's thoughts were clearer than ever\nsuddenly. He could feel her emotions; they were a part of him now. He\nsmiled. The Shielding boost had helped him. Integration--much more\ncomplete integration than he had ever known before.\n\n\"But Pete, honey,\" Alice said. \"What did you come over to the gate\nfor? You shouldn't of done it.\"\n\n\"Why not? I wanted to see you.\"\n\n\"What if one of Susan's pals sees us?\"\n\n\"So what? I'm getting tired of checking in every night, like a baby.\nBesides, one of her pals did see us, last night, at the bar.\"\n\n_Fear. What'll she do? Susan's a hellcat. I know she is. But maybe\nPete'll get really sick and tired of her. He looks it. He looks mad.\nI'd sure hate to have him mad at me...._\n\n\"Let's go for a spin, baby. Out in the suburbs somewhere. How about\nit?\"\n\n\"Well--why sure, Pete....\"\n\nSitting beside him in the copter. _All alone up here. Real romantic,\nlike something on the video. But I shouldn't with him married, and all\nthat. It's not right. But it's different, with Susan such a mean\nthing. Poor Petey...._\n\nRiuku prodded. He found it so much easier since the Shielding boost.\nIf only these Earthmen were more telepathic, so that they could be\ncontrolled directly. Still, perhaps with this new integration he could\naccomplish the same results. He prodded again.\n\n\"Pete,\" Alice said suddenly. \"What are we working on, anyway?\"\n\n\"What do you mean, working on?\" He frowned at her.\n\n\"At the plant. All I ever do is sit there soldering plugs, and no one\never tells me what for.\"\n\n\"Course not. You're not supposed to talk about any part of the job\nexcept your own. You know that. The slip of a lip--\"\n\n\"Can cost Earth a ship. I know. Quit spouting poster talk at me, Pete\nGanley. The enemy isn't even human. And there aren't any around here.\"\n\nPete looked over at her. She was pouting, the upper lip drawn under\nthe lower. Someone must have told her that was cute. Well, so what--it\nwas cute.\n\n\"What makes you think I know anything more than you do?\" he said.\n\n\"Well, gee.\" She looked up at him, so near to her in the moonlight\nthat she wondered why she wanted to talk about the plant anyway.\n\"You're in Final Assembly, aren't you? You check the whatsits before\nthey go out.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" he said. No harm in telling her. No spies now, not in this\nkind of war. Besides, she was too dumb to know anything.\n\n\"It's a simple enough gadget,\" Pete Ganley said. \"A new type of force\nfield weapon that the enemy can't spot until it hits them. They don't\neven know there's an Earth ship within a million miles, until\n_Bingo_!...\"\n\nShe drank it in, and in her mind Riuku did too. Wonderful integration,\nwonderful. Partial thought control. And now, he'd learn the secret....\n\n\"You really want to know how it works?\" Pete Ganley said. When she\nnodded he couldn't help grinning. \"Well, it's analogous to the field\nset up by animal neurones, in a way. You've just got to damp that\nfield, and not only damp it but blot it out, so that the frequency\nshows nothing at all there, and then--well, that's where those\nCorcoran assemblies you're soldering on come in. You produce the\nfield....\"\n\nAlice Hendricks listened. For some reason she wanted to listen. She\nwas really curious about the field. But, gee, how did he expect her to\nunderstand all that stuff? He sounded like her algebra teacher, or was\nit chemistry? Lord, how she'd hated school. Maybe she shouldn't have\nquit.\n\n_... Corcoran fields. E and IR and nine-space something or other.\nShe'd never seen Pete like this before. He looked real different. Sort\nof like a professor, or something. He must be real smart. And\nso--well, not good-looking especially but, well, appealing. Real SA,\nhe had...._\n\n\"So that's how it works,\" Pete Ganley said. \"Quite a weapon, against\nthem. It wouldn't work on a human being, of course.\" She was staring\nat him dreamy-eyed. He laughed. \"Silly, I bet you haven't understood a\nword I said.\"\n\n\"I have too.\"\n\n\"Liar.\" He locked the automatic pilot on the copter and held out his\narms. \"Come here, you.\"\n\n\"Oh, Petey....\"\n\nWho cared about the weapon? He was right, even if she wouldn't admit\nit. She hadn't even listened, hardly. She hadn't understood.\n\nAnd neither had Riuku.\n\n\n\nRiuku waited until she'd fallen soundly asleep that night before he\ntried contacting Nagor. He'd learned nothing useful. He'd picked up\nnothing in her mind except more thoughts of Pete, and gee, maybe\nsomeday they'd get married, if he only had guts enough to tell Susan\nwhere to get off....\n\nBut she was asleep at last. Riuku was free enough of her thoughts to\nbreak contact, partially of course, since if he broke it completely he\nwouldn't be able to get back through the Shielding. It was hard enough\nto reach out through it. He sent a painful probing feeler out into\nspace, to the spot where Nagor and the others waited for his report.\n\n\"Nagor....\"\n\n\"Riuku? Is that you?\"\n\n\"Yes. I've got a contact. A girl. But I haven't learned anything yet\nthat can help us.\"\n\n\"Louder, Riuku. I can hardly hear you....\"\n\nAlice Hendricks stirred in her sleep. The dream images slipped through\nher subconscious, almost waking her, beating against Riuku.\n\nPete, baby, you shouldn't be like that....\n\nRiuku cursed the bisexual species in their own language.\n\n\"Riuku!\" Nagor's call was harsh, urgent. \"You've got to find out. We\nhaven't much time. We lost three more ships today, and there wasn't a\nsign of danger. No Earthman nearby, no force fields, nothing. You've\ngot to find out why.\" Those ships just disappeared.\n\nRiuku forced his way up through the erotic dreams of Alice Hendricks.\n\"I know a little,\" he said. \"They damp their thought waves somehow,\nand keep us from spotting the Corcoran field.\"\n\n\"Corcoran field? What's that?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" Alice's thoughts washed over him, pulling him back\ninto complete integration, away from Nagor, into a medley of heroic\nPetes with gleaming eyes and clutching hands and good little Alices\npushing them away--for the moment.\n\n\"But surely you can find out through the girl,\" Nagor insisted from\nfar away, almost out of phase altogether.\n\n\"No, Pete!\" Alice Hendricks said aloud.\n\n\"Riuku, you're the only one of us with any possible sort of contact.\nYou've got to find out, if we're to stay here at all.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Alice Hendricks thought, \"maybe....\"\n\nRiuku cursed her again, in the lingua franca of a dozen systems.\nNagor's voice faded. Riuku switched back to English.\n\n\n\nSaturday. Into the plant at 3:58. Jean's diamond again.... _Wish it\nwould choke her; she's got a horsey enough face for it to. Where's old\nLiverlips? Don't see him around. Might as well go to the restroom for\na while...._\n\nThat's it, Riuku thought. Get her over past the machine shop, over by\nthat Restricted Area. There must be something there we can go on....\n\n\"Hello, Tommy,\" Alice Hendricks said. \"How's the love life?\"\n\n\"It could be better if someone I know would, uh, cooperate....\"\n\nShe looked past him, toward the corner where the big panels were with\nall the dials and the meters and the chart that was almost like the\nkind they drew pictures of earthquakes on. What was it for, anyway?\nAnd why couldn't anyone go over to it except those longhairs? High\nvoltage her foot....\n\n\"What're you looking at, Alice?\" Tommy said.\n\n\"Oh, that.\" She pointed. \"Wonder what it's for? It doesn't look like\nmuch of anything, really.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know. I've got something better to look at.\"\n\n\"Oh, _you_!\"\n\nCompared to Pete, he didn't have anything, not anything at all.\n\n... _Pete. Gee, he must have got home awful late last night. Wonder\nwhat Susan said to him. Why does he keep taking her lip, anyway?_\n\nRiuku waited. He prodded. He understood the Restricted Area as she\nunderstood it--which was not at all. He found out some things about\nthe 731 plugs--that a lot of them were real crummy ones the fool day\nshift girls had set up wrong, and besides she'd rather solder on the\n717's any day. He got her talking about the weapon again, and he found\nout what the other girls thought about it.\n\nNothing.\n\nExcept where else could you get twelve-fifty an hour soldering?\n\nShe was stretched out on the couch in the restroom lobby taking a\nshort nap--on company time, old Liverlips being tied up with the new\ngirls down at the other end of the line--when Riuku finally managed to\ncall Nagor again.\n\n\"Have you found out anything, Riuku?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\nSilence. Then: \"We've lost another ship. Maybe you'd better turn her\nloose and come on back. It looks as if we'll have to run for it, after\nall.\"\n\nDefeat. The long, interstellar search for another race, a race less\ntechnologically advanced than this one, and all because of a stupid\nEarth female.\n\n\"Not yet, Nagor,\" he said. \"Her boy friend knows. I'll find out. I'll\nmake her listen to him.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Nagor said doubtfully. \"All right. But hurry. We haven't much\ntime at all.\"\n\n\"I'll hurry,\" Riuku promised. \"I'll be back with you tonight.\"\n\nThat night after work Pete Ganley was waiting outside the gate again.\nAlice spotted his copter right away, even though he had the lights\nturned way down.\n\n\"Gee, Pete, I didn't think....\"\n\n\"Get in. Quick.\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" She climbed in beside him. He didn't answer until\nthe copter had lifted itself into the air, away from the factory\nlanding lots and the bright overhead lights and the home-bound\nworkers.\n\n\"It's Susan, who else,\" he said grimly. \"She was really sounding off\ntoday. She kept saying she had a lot of evidence and I'd better be\ncareful. And, well, I sure didn't want you turning up at the bar\ntonight of all nights.\"\n\nHe didn't sound like Pete.\n\n\"Why?\" Alice said. \"Are you afraid she'll divorce you?\"\n\n\"Oh, Alice, you're as bad as--look, baby, don't you see? It would be\nawful for you. All the publicity, the things she'd call you, maybe\neven in the papers....\"\n\nHe was staring straight ahead, his hands locked about the controls. He\nwas sort of--well, distant. Not her Petey any more. Someone else's\nPete. Susan's Pete....\n\n\"I think we should be more careful,\" he said.\n\nRiuku twisted his way through her thoughts, tried to push them\ndown.... _Does he love me, he's got to love me, sure he does, he just\ndoesn't want me to get hurt...._\n\nAnd far away, almost completely out of phase, Nagor's call. \"Riuku,\nanother ship's gone. You'd better come back. Bring what you've learned\nso far and we can withdraw from the system and maybe piece it\ntogether....\"\n\n\"In a little while. Just a little while.\" Stop thinking about Susan,\nyou biological schizo. Change the subject. You'll never get anything\nout of that man by having hysterics....\n\n\"I suppose,\" Alice cried bitterly, \"you've been leading me on all the\ntime. You don't love me. You'd rather have _her_!\"\n\n\"That's not so. Hell, baby....\"\n\n_He's angry. He's not even going to kiss me. I'm just cutting my own\nthroat when I act like that...._\n\n\"Okay, Pete. I'm sorry. I know it's tough on you. Let's have a drink,\nokay? Still got some in the glove compartment?\"\n\n\"Huh? Oh, sure.\"\n\nShe poured two drinks, neat, and he swallowed his with one impatient\ngulp. She poured him another.\n\n\n\nRiuku prodded. The drink made his job easier. Alice's thoughts calmed,\nswirled away from Susan and what am I going to do and why didn't I\npick up with some single guy, anyway? A single guy, like Tommy maybe.\nTommy and his spot welder, over there by the Restricted Area. The\nRestricted Area....\n\n\"Pete.\"\n\n\"Yeah, baby?\"\n\n\"How come they let so much voltage loose in the plant, so we can't\neven go over in the Restricted Area?\"\n\n\"Whatever made you think of that?\" He laughed suddenly. He turned to\nher, still laughing. He was the old Pete again, she thought, with his\nface happy and his mouth quirked up at the corner. \"Voltage loose ...\noh, baby, baby. Don't you know what that is?\"\n\n\"No. What?\"\n\n\"That's the control panel for one of the weapons, silly. It's only a\nduplicate, actually--a monitor station. But it's tuned to the\nfrequencies of all the ships in this sector and--\"\n\nShe listened. She wanted to listen. She had to want to listen, now.\n\n\"Nagor, I'm getting it,\" Riuku called. \"I'll bring it all back with\nme. Just a minute and I'll have it.\"\n\n\"How does it work, honey?\" Alice Hendricks said.\n\n\"You really want to know? Okay. Now the Corcoran field is generated\nbetween the ships and areas like that one, only a lot more powerful,\nby--\"\n\n\"It's coming through now, Nagor.\"\n\n\"--a very simple power source, once you get the basics of it. You--oh,\noh!\" He grabbed her arm. \"Duck, Alice!\"\n\nA spotlight flashed out of the darkness, turned on them, outlined\nthem. A siren whirred briefly, and then another copter pulled up\nbeside them and a loudspeaker blared tinnily.\n\n\"Okay, bud, pull down to the landing lane.\"\n\nThe police.\n\nPolice. Fear, all the way through Alice's thoughts, all the way\nthrough Riuku. Police. Earth law. That meant--it must mean he'd been\ndiscovered, that they had some other means of protection besides the\nShielding....\n\n\"Nagor! I've been discovered!\"\n\n\"Come away then, you fool!\"\n\nHe twisted, trying to pull free of Alice's fear, away from the\nintegration of their separate terrors. But he couldn't push her\nthoughts back from his. She was too frightened. He was too frightened.\nThe bond held.\n\n\"Oh, Pete, Pete, what did you do?\"\n\nHe didn't answer. He landed the copter, stepped out of it, walked back\nto the other copter that was just dropping down behind him. \"But\nofficer, what's the matter?\"\n\nAlice Hendricks huddled down in the seat, already seeing tomorrow's\npapers, and her picture, and she wasn't really photogenic, either....\nAnd then, from the other copter, she heard the woman laugh.\n\n\"Pete Ganley, you fall for anything, don't you?\"\n\n\"Susan!\"\n\n\"You didn't expect me to follow you, did you? Didn't it ever occur to\nyou that detectives could put a bug in your copter? My, what we've\nbeen hearing!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" the detective who was driving said. \"And those pictures we\ntook last night weren't bad either.\"\n\n\"Susan, I can explain everything....\"\n\n\"I'm sure you can, Pete. You always try. But as for you--you little--\"\n\nAlice ducked down away from her. Pictures. Oh God, what it would make\nher look like. Still, this hag with the pinched up face who couldn't\nhold a man with all the cosmetics in the drugstore to camouflage\nher--she had her nerve, yelling like that.\n\n\"Yeah, and I know a lot about you too!\" Alice Hendricks cried.\n\n\"Why, let me get my hands on you....\"\n\n\"Riuku!\"\n\nRiuku prodded. Calm down, you fool. You're not gaining anything this\nway. Calm down, so I can get out of here....\n\nAlice Hendricks stopped yelling abruptly.\n\n\"That's better,\" Susan said. \"Pete, your taste in women gets worse\neach time. I don't know why I always take you back.\"\n\n\"I can explain everything.\"\n\n\"Oh, Pete,\" Alice Hendricks whispered. \"Petey, you're not--\"\n\n\"Sure he is,\" Susan Ganley said. \"He's coming with me. The nice\ndetectives will take you home, dear. But I don't think you'd better\ntry anything with them--they're not your type. They're single.\"\n\n\"Pete....\" But he wouldn't meet Alice's eyes. And when Susan took his\narm, he followed her.\n\n\"How could you do it, Petey....\" Numb whispers, numb thoughts, over\nand over, but no longer frightened, no longer binding on Riuku.\n\nFools, he thought. Idiotic Earthmen. If it weren't for your ridiculous\nreproductive habits I'd have found out everything. As it is....\n\"Nagor, I'm coming! I didn't get anything. This woman--\"\n\n\"Well, come on then. We're leaving. Right now. There'll be other\nsystems.\"\n\n_Petey, Petey, Petey...._\n\nContact thinned as he reached out away from her, toward Nagor, toward\nthe ship. He fought his way out through the Shielding, away from her\nand her thoughts and every detestable thing about her. Break free,\nbreak free....\n\n\"What's the matter, Riuku? Why don't you come? Have the police caught\nyou?\"\n\nThe others were fleeing, getting farther away even as he listened to\nNagor's call. Contact was hard to maintain now; he could feel\ncommunication fading.\n\n\"Riuku, if you don't come now....\"\n\nHe fought, but Alice's thoughts were still with him; Alice's tears\nstill kept bringing him back into full awareness of her.\n\n\"Riuku!\"\n\n\"I--I can't!\"\n\nThe Shielding boost, that had integrated him so completely with Alice\nHendricks, would never let him go.\n\n\"Oh, Petey, I've lost you....\"\n\nAnd Nagor's sad farewell slipped completely out of phase, leaving him\nalone, with her.\n\nThe plant. The Restricted Area. The useless secret of Earth's now\nunneeded weapon. Alice Hendricks glancing past it, at the spot welding\nmachine, at Tommy.\n\n\"How's the love life?\"\n\n\"You really interested in finding out, Alice?\"\n\n\"Well--maybe--\"\n\nAnd Riuku gibbered unheard in her mind.\n\n",
