She, too, wanted ROMANCE, and wasn't coy about running after her\n\"guy\"]\n\n\n\"There you are!\" Judson Taylor, the eccentric physics prof, pulled a\nmetallic object out of his pocket and laid it on the table between us.\nThe object was a solid chunk of some kind of metal, judging from its\nbright silver color, about the size and shape of a pocket knife.\n\nI looked at it stupidly and said, \"_Where_ are we?\"\n\nI am Bill Halley. Some of the adolescent undergraduate brats at this\none-horse college have nicknamed me \"Comet\" and it burns me up every\ntime some pimply-faced baby waves his arm at me and says, \"Hiya, Comet.\"\nBut I smile and don't let them know I don't like it, because if they\nknew there would be no living with them. Jud is head of the physics\ndepartment and I am one of the three profs under him. When I first came\nhere last fall he looked at my papers, said \"BILL HALLEY?\" and since\nthen has treated me with the respect he reserves only for the gods of\nPhysics. Probably assumed I was a direct descendant of the Halley who\ngot his name plastered all over Halley's Comet.\n\nAnyway, between classes this morning he had excitedly asked me to meet\nhim at the Campus Lunch during the noon hour and he would show me his\nlatest discovery--and here we were, wherever that was. I picked up the\nhunk of metal and turned it over in the palm of my hand, sipping my\ncoffee from a cup held in my other hand, and tried to figure out why he\nwas so excited.\n\nThere was a peculiar warmth to the stuff. Maybe it was radioactive. But\nno, it was too light to be one of the heavy elements. I tossed it back\nto the table top and then nearly rose to the ceiling. The stuff hadn't\nbounced with a metallic sound at all, but had settled slowly, coming to\nrest with no sign of a bump.\n\nI picked it up again and looked at Jud, puzzled.\n\nHe grinned and said, \"Watch this.\" Then he looked at the lump of metal\nin a peculiar manner like he might be trying mental telepathy out on it,\nand suddenly the stuff weighed a ton. It forced my hand down so fast\nthat it bruised as it struck the table. As suddenly the stuff became\nlight again and Judson Taylor had hold of my hand, rubbing it.\n\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry, Bill. I am not too good at controlling it yet.\"\n\n\"What the hell IS that stuff?\" I ground out.\n\n\"I don't know, exactly,\" he replied. \"Mallory, the biochemist, made it\nand brought it to me. He said he got a lot of chemicals spilled. One of\nthem was a rare enzyme that he didn't want to lose, so he mopped up the\nmess and put it in a large flask and added some alcohol, getting ready\nto recover this valuable enzyme. Suddenly this stuff started to form on\nthe sides of the flask, just like silver in the mirror coating process.\nBut all the chemicals were pure hydro-carbons with no silver or other\nmetal present. According to Mallory this stuff is some unknown\nhydro-carbon. I've been playing with it for two days now.\"\n\nJudson Taylor put the stuff back in his pocket and rose.\n\n\"Let's go over to my lab. I want to show you some things I've found out\nabout it.\"\n\nI gulped down the rest of my coffee and followed him. We crossed the\ncampus of good old Puget U to the antique building which housed the\nphysics department. We climbed the creaking stairs to the third floor\nwhich was devoted mostly to Jud's own private research and was filled\nwith apparatus that he had accumulated during the thirty years he had\nbeen kingpin of this department.\n\nJud crossed over to a bench on which there was a balance and some other\nstuff and placed the hunk of mystery on one tray of the balance. On the\nother tray he placed a ten-gram weight. The balance swayed a little and\nthen came to rest on the zero mark, showing the stuff weighed exactly\nten grams. Then he placed another ten-gram weight on the tray and the\nbalance came to rest on the zero mark, showing the stuff weighed exactly\ntwenty grams!\n\n\"Now watch,\" he said. He placed the silver chunk on the same side as the\ntwo ten-gram weights, leaving the tray it had been in absolutely empty.\nThe balance fluctuated a little and again came to rest on the zero mark,\nshowing a minus twenty grams!\n\nBy that time I had stopped believing what my eyes told me.\n\n\"That's quite a trick,\" I said skeptically. \"How do you work it?\" And I\nstooped to look under the table, hoping to see a setup of magnets hidden\nthere that would help restore my belief in my sanity.\n\n\"I don't work it,\" Jud exclaimed irritably. \"It acts that way itself.\"\n\n\n\nI forgot my one o'clock class entirely. Jud and I played around with\nthat hunk of metallic hydro-carbon most of the afternoon, arguing back\nand forth about what caused it to do the things it did. I found out that\nif I thought of beefsteak rare while I looked at it, it would weigh\nexactly ten pounds, and if I thought of a chicken with its neck being\nwrung the stuff would float up to the ceiling. I tried all sorts of\nthoughts on it and got some of the craziest results. But whatever I\nthought, when I thought of the same thing again I got the same results.\nBut my results were different than Jud's! When he thought of a chicken\nwith its neck being wrung the stuff didn't float up to the ceiling but\ninstead made the floor creak and groan. Finally we took it over to the\nfeed company and put it on their car scales. Then when Jud thought of a\nchicken with its neck being wrung, we found that the stuff weighed\ntwelve thousand four hundred and eighty pounds! And it was no bigger\nthan a pocket knife!\n\nAs we stood there and looked at the feed scales in utter amazement I\nsaid, \"Look, Jud, we've got something here. I've got an idea. Suppose we\nrig up a strong resting place for this stuff in my car. Then when I\nthink of the right thing it will push the car forward at any speed I\nwant to go. We'll have to be careful or it will wreck us, but--maybe\nafter we know what we are doing we can build a space ship!\"\n\nWell, to cut a long story short, two days later Mallory, the biochemist,\nJud Taylor, and I were speeding along the state highway with the needle\nhovering around eighty-five, the engine out of gear and dead, and a\ncrazy bit of silver stuff encased in a special frame in the dashboard\nwith reinforcing bars down to the chassis holding it steady.\n\nIt took two of us to drive the car, though, because one of us had to\ndrive and the other concentrate on the stuff.\n\nJud had named the stuff \"tellepan\" before he showed it to me that noon,\nbut I pointed out that tellepan sounded too much like Japanese for\nturtle, so he renamed it \"tellecarbon.\" Mallory had been wracking his\nbrains trying to figure the chemical composition of the stuff, but all\nhe had found out was that the stuff could not absorb any heat whatever,\nnor emit any, it had any weight you wanted to give it, and when left\nalone assumed any weight it seemed to fancy at the moment. Moreover, no\nreagent could touch it. Even aqua regia and hydrofluoric acid couldn't\ntouch it. It could be manipulated like putty and molded into any shape\nwith a little persuasion; it always remained the same bright silver\ncolor, and it seemed to be the connecting link between gravity and\nthought.\n\nMallory even got some more bottles of the chemicals he had spilled and\nspilled them over again, cleaning them up and putting some alcohol in\nthe mess like he had done the first time, but no more tellecarbon\nappeared. We finally had to face the facts. Tellecarbon was some complex\nhydro-carbon because all of its basic constituents were hydro-carbons.\nWe had the only bit of it in existence and no more could be made.\n\n\n\nAfter we had driven for a couple of hours, Jud changed his thought to\nsomething else and we came to a halt on the highway. No one was in sight\nso we decided to try our second experiment. For that I had to do the\nthinking because none of Jud's thoughts seemed to work in the attempts\nwe had made in the laboratory. I brought to my mind's eye the image of a\nchicken with its neck being wrung. Then made it two of them. The car\nrose slowly off the ground. Then Jud thought his thoughts that made it\nmove forward. By regulating the number of dying chickens in my thoughts\nI could cause the car to rise or sink at will.\n\nSoon we were quite high, or at least Mallory said we were. I looked out\nof the window to see and the car started to hurtle to the ground. It\nscared me so much that I almost couldn't calm my mind enough to think of\nchickens, but finally made it just in time. By a supreme effort of will\nI managed to get the car down safely on the highway again. Then I gave\nin to my emotions and shook like a leaf.\n\nWe had had enough for the day, so we covered up the tellecarbon and\nstarted the motor, getting back to the U at dusk.\n\nWhen we alighted from the car in front of the boarding house in which\nMallory and I stayed, we were still a little shaky over our narrow\nescape. We stood on the sidewalk by the car for a moment trying to\ndecide whether to go up to my room, to Mallory's or down the street a\nblock to Jud's house. We compromised on Pokey's Malt Shop at the corner\nand finally settled with a sigh of relief in a booth way at the back.\n\nWith a round of black coffee in front of us we settled down to business.\nNothing less than a space ship would do. Here in our hands, or rather\nout in my car, we had the secret of untold power. With that little hunk\nof tellecarbon and a certain amount of concentration on it we could\ntravel to Mars and back like nothing flat. During summer vacation for\nthe last two years Mallory and I had worked in the shipyards and gained\npractical experience in welding, boilermaking and sheetmetal work. The\ntwo of us could build a small space ship by ourselves. All that would be\nnecessary would be to make it airtight, with enough insulation to keep\nour heat from radiating into space. The rest of the problem involved\nonly ordering stuff from catalogues. Carbon dioxide absorbers, tanks of\noxygen, food, various instruments, and so on. That would be Jud's work.\n\nJust as we were finishing our coffees, Lahoma Rice, the secretary in the\nDean's office, came in and discovered us. Mallory and I had been more or\nless competing for her affections for some time. It was the only thing\nthat had ever come between us in our years at college together and the\nyears since then. We both tried to keep it on a friendly basis, but\nunderneath it had become pretty serious.\n\nWhen we saw her coming Jud whispered quickly, \"Keep quiet about all this\nin front of her. We don't want anybody to know about our amazing\ndiscovery at this early date.\"\n\nComing over, she slid into the booth beside Jud and flashed a smile at\nme and Mallory.\n\n\"Well, what's all the hush-hush about?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing,\" answered Mallory, looking completely unconcerned.\n\n\"Ha, ha. That's right. Absolutely nothing at all,\" I echoed, to make it\nmore convincing. But somehow it didn't sound quite as convincing as I\nhad intended. Even I noticed that at once, and a secret dangled before\nthe nose of a woman. It awoke in her an undefeatable urge. Before we\ncould rally our forces she was in on the secret and determined to go\nwith us when we went to Mars.\n\n\"But Lahoma,\" Mallory desperately pleaded, \"you don't need to come\nalong. I'll be all right.\"\n\n\"I wasn't thinking of you,\" Lahoma retorted icily, and although she did\nnot look at me as she said that, my heart quickened its tempo at the\nhidden inference in her words.\n\nSo it was settled. The four of us were to go as soon as school let out\nthe next summer. During the winter Mallory and I would build the space\nship in the old boat house down on the beach just a few blocks from the\ncampus.\n\n\n\nIt was really fun that winter, working late into the night putting the\nspace ship together. Our crowning achievement was retractible wings for\nsteering the ship in atmosphere. In space, of course, steering would\nhave to be done by small steering rockets. The main drive force, though,\nwould be the missing link, as we had been calling it all winter.\n\nCame the spring, as somebody in the English department might say, and\nthe ship was complete. During the spring months we used the last of our\njoint resources to stock it with all sorts of things, including seeds\nfor planting, in case we could not get back, or didn't want to come\nback. Our final load, at the end of the school year, was books. Nothing\nbut books, and literally tons of them on everything from languages to\nphilosophy, from farming to the Bessemer Process.\n\nThen we were ready. During the winter we had all read everything we\ncould get on interplanetary travel. Most of it was, of course, fiction,\nbut each author had his own little idea that we could consider, so that\nby the time we were ready to shove off we had a fairly complete grasp of\nevery problem we could possibly encounter--or so we fondly hoped.\n\nThe ship was cigar-shaped, about eighty feet long and twenty feet in\ndiameter. It had been built so that in space, away from gravity, we\ncould start it spinning with the small rockets and use centrifugal force\nto keep us on the deck, which lined the shell. There were ballast tanks\nto keep one side down when in a gravity field, the water ballast being\ntransferred to the center tube tank before the spin was started, to\ntransfer the center of mass of the ship to the axis of rotation.\n\nWe started early in the evening, heading into the east to take advantage\nof the thousand-mile-an-hour speed of the earth's surface.\n\nThe missing link, the hunk of tellecarbon, was encased in a polished\nbrass case in the exact center of gravity of the ship, strong girders\nconnecting it to the shell. A sound-proof booth surrounded it in which\nthe operator would not be distracted. A panel of signal lights was\nimmediately below it where the operator could see it without taking his\neyes off the tellecarbon. When we took off I was in the driver's seat,\nLahoma standing beside me. We had found that when she thought of\nhamburger sandwiches the tellecarbon became antigravitational, just as\nwhen I thought of chickens being killed.\n\nIt took the combined power of our thoughts to lift the ship. As we found\nout later, the ship rose sluggishly from the water and floated\nerratically upward, reaching the stratosphere in a little over an hour.\nBy midnight we were over two thousand miles above the Earth's surface\nand rising more and more rapidly. By then both of us were exhausted and\nspelling each other off every ten minutes.\n\nJud was constantly determining our position and speed. At two o'clock in\nthe morning he relieved Lahoma and concentrated on the tellecarbon to\ngive us more forward speed. By eight o'clock in the morning our speed\nand direction of travel were correct for escape from the Earth's gravity\nfield toward the planet Mars, and I crawled out of the control booth,\npractically a wreck.\n\n\n\nFrom there on it was smooth sailing. We would coast along for two months\nbefore nearing Mars, and play with the gadgets we had brought along for\ntaking all sorts of measurements in outer space.\n\nSpace is very different than most writers picture it. Instead of being\ndark it is intensely bright in all directions. It was fortunate that we\nhad movable dark shields on each porthole. By varying the number over a\nporthole we could block out most of the light and keep our objective in\nview.\n\nOur most amazing discovery was that the temperature of interplanetary\nspace is not absolutely zero. Our outside thermostat, carefully shielded\nagainst all rays, that is, infrared, visible, and ultraviolet, and in\nthe vacuum of space, showed a constant temperature of minus one hundred\nand three degrees F. at all times in outer space. Jud explained that\nthis was probably due to x-rays and cosmic rays which could penetrate\nthe protective shield.\n\nOn the fifty-eighth day after leaving the earth, Jud, at the forward\ntelescope, became suddenly excited. Dashing from the telescope to the\nchart table he began scribbling figures, ignoring our queries as to what\nwas wrong. After fifteen minutes of figuring he straightened up, a\nworried frown on his face.\n\nMuttering, \"I was afraid of that,\" he brushed by us to the control booth\nand slammed the door behind him. A half-hour later he came out and again\nwent to the telescope. Glancing through it, he made adjustments and then\nread them. Dashing back to the table he again scribbled some figures.\nWhen he had finished he stood there, his head bowed, staring at them.\nThen he looked up at our faces and said solemnly, \"What I have been\nfearing in the back of my mind has happened. The tellecarbon no longer\nresponds to mental suggestion. It has taken over control of the ship\nitself and, judging from our present course, we aren't going to ever get\nto Mars.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Lahoma asked.\n\n\"I mean,\" Jud answered slowly, \"that at present we have a velocity great\nenough to escape from the solar system and that it is increasing every\nmoment. Furthermore, a half-hour of concentration on the tellecarbon has\nnot altered our course in the slightest. Wherever we are headed, it is\nnot any planet in this system!\"\n\n\n\nThe effect of his words cannot be imagined by anyone not in the position\nwe were in. We stood there stunned. Our little, spinning world of iron\nand steel kept on spinning. Our gravity, which we had become accustomed\nto, was different in many ways than flat gravity. For example, our floor\nwas curved, yet a dime dropped on it would roll in any direction along\nthe curve just like it was a flat surface. But something near the center\ntube of the ship was practically weightless. So the center of gravity of\nour bodies was not the same as its center of mass. This made itself felt\nin thousands of little things. Heart action, sense of balance, and even\nin walking.\n\nPicture, if you can, Jud standing several feet from me, his body forming\nan angle of about thirty degrees with mine, both of our bodies erect,\nour expressions serious. Picture also Lahoma and Mallory, their bodies\nat still different angles. Throw in the absolute silence of that moment.\nNot a single sound except our breathing, not even a creak from the ship.\nIf there had only been a cricket to chirp, or a snake, or a fly buzzing,\nto make it seem like good old terra firma--but there was only the\ninterstellar silence and the absolute lack of vibration in the air and\nthe ship. And nearly two months of it, soaked into the marrow of our\nbones.\n\nI for one would have welcomed a hit against the hull at that moment to\ntake us out of ourselves and make us fight for our existence. Anything\nexcept the silent impersonal inexorableness of the lonely universe.\n\nIn ten more months our food would be exhausted. In two years our air\ncould no longer be renewed because the chemicals which renewed it would\nbe no good. Our water supply would last forever, with the system of\nrecovery by distillation we had set up. But what is a year's food\nsupply? If we tossed the tellecarbon out into the void and rode free it\nwould be hundreds of years before our ship again entered the solar\nsystem in its long ellipse. And if we kept the tellecarbon in the ship,\nin another week even that hope would be gone. We could never return!\nUNLESS we could regain control of the tellecarbon.\n\nLahoma voiced the question that came to all our minds at the same time.\n\n\"What could possibly be the cause of the change in the tellecarbon?\" And\nnone of us had an answer.\n\nBut that was the key to our salvation. IF we could regain control of the\ntellecarbon we could at least return to Earth and give up our grand\nplans of exploration and discovery. Not a one of us would have been\nunwilling to return to good old PU at that moment and stay there, living\nour humdrum lives for the rest of our days!\n\n\"We'd better get busy,\" I said, taking the initiative. \"We must cut a\nbit of the tellecarbon off the parent chunk and experiment with it. We\nmust also keep constant check on our course to find out just what\naccelerating force is now acting, and whether it changes any. And we\nmust all think of everything we can that might be the cause of this\nrevolt of the tellecarbon.\"\n\n\n\nSuiting my actions to my words I got a wood chisel out of the tool\nlocker and went into the booth, going to work on the missing link. To my\nsurprise I had no trouble obtaining a thin slice of the silvery stuff.\nIt lay in my hand, apparently as tame as any other substance.\n\nI carried it out of the booth and laid it on the desk. The four of us\nstood looking at it. Suddenly it jumped forward and plastered itself\nagainst the forward porthole frame. We felt a slight lurch. The ship was\ngaining speed!\n\nWhat had happened? In all our experience with the stuff it worked only\nby thought. It had jumped forward, and the lurch of the ship told us\nthat the parent chunk as well as the sliver had acted together! Only one\nthing could account for that. Some intelligence was controlling it. Some\nintelligence so powerful that it could reach across space and blank out\nour control completely, taking over the direction of our ship!\n\nWe crowded around the forward porthole and peered out. Somewhere, far\nahead, was our destination. And at our destination some creature of vast\nmental power was aware of our presence. Was forcing us to come to it. We\nwere all aware of that without speaking.\n\nSuddenly Lahoma began to laugh hysterically. The insane noise shattered\nthe silence with painful abruptness. I grabbed her by the shoulders and\nshook her. Her laughter changed to sobs.\n\nAnd now the acceleration of the ship had become so great that it was\nhard to stand erect. The rubber soles of our shoes was all that kept us\nfrom sliding to the stern of the ship.\n\nLahoma got hold of herself by a tremendous effort, and shook off my arm\nwhich I had placed around her to keep her from falling.\n\n\"Look,\" she said to us, \"maybe there isn't any super intelligence\nsucking us into outer space. Maybe it's our own thoughts. I don't know\nhow the rest of you have been feeling, but for several days now I have\nhad a fear of outer space that has been growing simply terrific.\nSomething like the fear of falling as you look over the edge of a cliff.\nCould that have anything to do with what's going on?\"\n\n\"Maybe that's it!\" Jud exclaimed. \"We don't know half enough about this\nstuff. It could be that such a fear would make it do the very thing\nfeared.\"\n\nAs if in answer, the ship stopped accelerating.\n\n\"That MUST be it!\" Mallory shouted.\n\n\"We have a clue I hadn't thought of,\" Jud added. Looking at me he went\non, \"When you think of a chicken with its head being wrung, what thought\ngoes with it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I hesitated, \"I think of a swell chicken dinner.\"\n\n\"I think of how awful it is to kill!\" Jud exclaimed. \"It doesn't react\nto the idea but to the emotion.\"\n\nWe experimented from that basis--without result. The tellecarbon was in\ncomplete revolt. It paid no attention to us.\n\n\n\nTwo more days and we had to admit we were licked. Jud voiced what we had\nall begun to suspect.\n\n\"The tellecarbon must have developed a mind of its own,\" he said\ndispiritedly. \"We should have taken that into account. It reacts to\nthought, so undoubtedly it has a few of the properties of the mind. What\nwe must try to do now is reason with it--try to find out why it has\nbecome uncooperative. Let's all concentrate on that question and direct\nit at the tellecarbon and see what happens.\"\n\nWe tried it. Nothing seemed to happen for quite a while.\n\n\"An idea just came into my mind,\" Lahoma said suddenly. \"It's absurd. I\njust thought, 'Suppose there is another chunk of tellecarbon out here\nand our chunk is lonesome?' The way it has been cruising around the past\nfew days and ignoring us, it might have sensed another piece like it out\nhere and be looking for it!\"\n\n\"That's funny,\" I spoke up. \"The thought just occurred to me too!\"\n\n\"Me too,\" Mallory exclaimed.\n\n\"Then it must be so,\" Jud said. \"Obviously the thought came from the\ntellecarbon in reply to our question!\"\n\n\"But how can it think?\" Mallory questioned. \"After all it was\nprecipitated as a fine film, and you can quash it and even slice it up\nwithout any trouble.\"\n\n\"In science,\" Jud said, \"you don't try to argue away facts. You accept\nthe facts and go on from there.\"\n\n\"Let's go on from there, then,\" Lahoma spoke up. \"Tillie--we might as\nwell call her that now that we know she, the tellecarbon, you know,\nthinks--is looking for a companion. We might as well help her look.\"\n\n\"How do you know it isn't a him?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, just a feeling,\" Lahoma replied.\n\n\"Oh, fine,\" Mallory groaned. \"We should have suspected it was a female\nthe way it started galivanting all over the solar system.\"\n\n\"So that's the way you think of us females, Mallory!\" Lahoma exclaimed\nangrily.\n\nI smiled to myself. A few more remarks like that from Mallory and I\nwould have the field to myself. IF we ever got back to the Earth, which\nI doubted. Secretly I agreed with Mallory. If the chunk of tellecarbon\nwas a female we had much less of a chance than if it were a male or an\nit.\n\nJud went to the telescope and started looking for a stray chunk of\nsilvery looking stuff. An air of semi-hopelessness began to settle over\nall of us. The chances of finding such a thing were extremely slim.\n\nAlmost at once, though, Jud let out an exclamation of triumph. We rushed\nto his side and took turns looking into the telescope. There, less than\na quarter of a mile ahead of us, was something that flashed with silvery\nbrilliance like the belly of a trout in a clear stream. We followed the\nflashes and soon figured out that Tillie was not searching for her\ncompanion, but had found him long ago and was, female like, pursuing\nhim!\n\n\n\nWhen the distance between them shortened, the silvery chunk ahead of us\nspeeded up. When the distance between us increased, it slowed down\nagain. It was obviously enjoying the chase.\n\n\"This could go on forever,\" Mallory groaned, sticking his foot in his\nmouth again.\n\nLahoma ignored the opening.\n\n\"It's obvious what we must do,\" she said, sounding quite capable.\n\"Tillie needs a little advice on love making. I'm quite sure that Oscar,\nor whatever his name is, would pursue Tillie if she stopped CHASING him.\nWe've got to convince her of that and get her to try it.\"\n\nEvidently she didn't need convincing. She got the idea direct from\nLahoma and acted on it. The silver flash ahead swung away. Half an hour\nlater it showed up in the stern telescope.\n\nThis seemed to delight Tillie, the tellecarbon, no end. She cavorted\nabout like a drunken puppy, giving us all a bad case of sea sickness.\n\n\"Now,\" Lahoma gasped. \"We must coax Tillie into setting us back on\nEarth. I don't know how you men feel, but I would be quite willing to\nturn Tillie loose so she could join her mate--once we were safely home.\"\n\n\"But if we did that we wouldn't be able to explore the Solar System!\"\nJud exclaimed.\n\n\"And if we don't we'll probably wind up flattened against some asteroid\nas soon as Tillie decides to break out of her shell,\" Lahoma snapped.\n\nI blanched at the thought. Mallory's knees buckled and he sat down on\nthe floor weakly. Jud himself swayed a little.\n\nThat eventuality just hadn't occurred to us before. Obviously Tillie\nwould get tired of the chase and want to settle down and get cozy some\nday. If she hadn't acquired the idea from us she might figure it out by\nherself and dash us against some jagged bit of space rock.\n\n\"All right. All right,\" Jud said weakly. \"Let's see if we can talk\nTillie into taking us back home in exchange for her freedom. As an\narguing point you might all visualize the smashed ship, with her still\nimprisoned and all of us dead and unable to help free her.\"\n\nAn invisible hand seemed to push us to the back of the ship. We were\npicking up speed faster than we ever had before.\n\nI slowly climbed to the forward telescope and looked through it. Dead\ncenter was a small twinkling Earth with the Moon hovering near it.\n\nI informed the rest. They shouted with relief. We were on our way home!\n\nThe stern telescope showed the other piece of tellecarbon following\nus--almost sniffing at our heels. It held there, day after day, while\nthe Earth grew larger and larger.\n\n\n\nAt the last Jud stood at the telescope and directed us in. After\ncircling about ten thousand miles up until Puget Sound was directly\nbelow us, Tillie dipped down in obedience to his unspoken command.\n\nThe whistling sound of atmosphere on the shell was the sweetest music\never played by gods or men!\n\nWe landed on Puget Sound opposite the campus. The minute we touched\nshore I took a wrench and unscrewed the framework that held the\ntellecarbon in place in the center tube. I could feel a rapid, excited\nvibration as it waited--I mean she.\n\nNo sooner was the last bolt loosened than she darted away. She almost\nreached the open porthole where Mallory had taken his first breath of\nfresh air when she stopped and returned.\n\nTillie, the silvery blob of matter, came back and touched my cheek\nsoftly. Then she did the same to Lahoma.\n\nWe wasted no time in climbing out of the ship to the shore. There we\nlooked up. Far over our heads were two silver flashes of brilliance that\nzoomed in ever-widening spirals.\n\nI felt someone beside me and glanced down. Lahoma was standing there.\nCautiously I put my arm around her waist.\n\nWith a starry look in her bright eyes as she glanced at me, she twined\nher arm around me. Then we looked up again.\n\nFar above we saw a wonderful sight. The two silver flashes seemed to\ncome together. There was a blinding light as from a tremendous\nexplosion; but unlike an explosion it remained bright. It was like a\nmorning star--a sun, far, far away. It grew smaller and smaller until at\nlast it seemed just another star twinkling in the heavens.\n\nThere was an aftermath. We sold the space ship to a Ferry Boat company\nand they transformed it into a streamlined excursion boat with a\nconventional motor to drive it. But that isn't what I'm talking about.\n\nLahoma and I got married shortly after. I had sense enough to capitalize\non the romance of the tellecarbons and proposed right then and there.\nShe accepted, of course.\n\nBut it was two years later when our first child was born--little William\nLawrence. One Sunday we were down at the beach strolling along, pushing\nthe go-cart in the twilight.\n\nA full moon beamed down upon us and a million stars twinkled in the\nclear sky. The waves washed with sleepy sounds against the sandy shore\nand now and then a sea gull came close enough so we could hear the\nswishing of its wings.\n\nInto this pleasant scene came a sound--at first so faint it could hardly\nbe heard. It was a shrill scream of some object hurtling through the\natmosphere above, almost like the whine of plane struts, only much\nhigher pitched.\n\nLahoma and I glanced up. There, far up, something silvery flashed. As\nour eyes adjusted themselves we saw that there were at least two of\nthem, and they were coming closer.\n\nJust as they seemed about to crash into the sandy beach they paused.\nThere were two large pieces of silvery substance and five small pieces.\n\nThey hovered near us, quivering and scintillating. Then one of the two\nlarger ones came over and touched my cheek softly. The warmth of its\ntouch was almost human.\n\nWith coruscating brilliance it left me to pause and touch Lahoma's\ncheek. Then it darted down the beach, the other large piece just behind\nit, and the five little ones trailing along.\n\nLahoma put her arm around my waist and looked up into my eyes. And we\nboth chuckled and chuckled and chuckled.",
