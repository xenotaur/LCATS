    "body": "Henry Ohm leaped to his feet, stared across the intervening ground at\nigloo number 2, plainly visible through the clear plastic walls. Its\ndoor had just been flung violently open. Then Sofi Jokai scooted out\nand fled madly across the jagged surface of the asteroid.\n\nHard on the girl's heels pounded R-7. The robot, Hen saw with a gulp,\nwas waving a large wrench in one metal fist.\n\n\"Oh-oh!\" Hen muttered and plunged down the incline for the airlock.\n\nHe shot a second glance through the transparent curved walls, slowed\ndown. The robot would never catch Sofi. Even burdened by her oxygen\nsuit, the girl was leaving R-7 far in the rear.\n\nAt the airlock, Henry Ohm paused, regarding the chase with sober,\ndeep-set black eyes. He was a tall, thin young man, nearing thirty.\nHis face was narrow; prominent cheek bones and a thin, straight nose\ngave his features an angular pleasant mould. He made no move to don\nthe emergency oxygen helmet beside the lock, but waited with a vague\nexpression of annoyance.\n\nSofi reached the airlock, burst inside, sealed and locked the outer\ndoor behind her. The air had scarcely filled the chamber before she\nflung open the inner door, confronted Henry Ohm, and exploded into a\nflood of angry words. Not a sound escaped her plastic helmet which she\nhad forgotten to remove.\n\nHe let her rattle away silently inside her helmet, nodding at\nintervals, rubbing his chin until she paused for breath.\n\n\"That's what you get for trying to run a mine all alone on this\ngod-forsaken asteroid,\" he informed her, \"even if you are a\nyellow-haired hell cat.\"\n\nSofi looked at him blankly.\n\nOhm rapped with his knuckles on her helmet. \"If you'd take that thing\noff, you could hear me. But you're the excitable type. Probably have an\noveractive thyroid.\"\n\nSofi jerked off her helmet. She had a mass of fine wavy yellow hair cut\nlike a halo about her oval face. Her features were delicately moulded,\nher eyes large and blue. She was only a few inches shorter than Henry\nOhm, but more slenderly built.\n\n\"What the hell were you saying?\" she demanded suspiciously.\n\n\"I wanted to know what you'd been doing to the robots this time?\"\n\n\"Me?\"\n\n\"What happened in the mine?\"\n\n\"Rational robots!\" Sofi Jokai planted hands on slender but ample hips.\n\"I was an idiot to listen to you, Hen.\"\n\nHe repressed a chuckle. His glance flicked to the surface of the\nasteroid beyond the plastic walls of the igloo. R-7, he saw, had taken\na stance at the lock like a cat at a mouse hole.\n\n\n\nAlthough built along the general design of man, the robot was no\ngrotesque copy. He was a complex functional piece of machinery as\nbeautiful in his way as the cobwebby spans of a bridge, a streamlined\njet plane, or a fine watch.\n\n\"But Sofi, they're still in the experimental stage. They--\"\n\n\"Experimental's right,\" the girl interrupted passionately. \"D'you\nrealize what R-7 has done now?\"\n\nHe grinned. \"No. What?\"\n\n\"He's taken the mining worm apart--that's what. I knew he would!\"\n\n\"Knew he would? Did you warn him not to?\"\n\n\"Yes. Of course I did. I had to leave him to check the reduction plant.\nI had a presentiment....\"\n\n\"Woman's intuition, I suppose,\" Hen interrupted. \"You'd sold yourself\non the idea R-7 was going to take the worm apart.\"\n\n\"If you like,\" returned Sofi in a chilly voice. \"When I came back, R-7\nwas gone and the worm was strewn all over the floor. I was furious. I\nfound R-7 on the fourth level. I started to land into him, but--but--\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"He looked so queer.\"\n\n\"How the hell can a piece of machinery look queer?\"\n\n\"Well, he did,\" said Sofi indignantly. \"He looked as if he was going to\ntake me apart, too!\"\n\nHenry groaned. \"Go on,\" he said resignedly.\n\n\"Why, then R-7 wanted to know if I was put together or if I came all in\none piece.\" She bit her lip. \"He started to find out.\"\n\nShe slipped off the oxygen suit. She was clad in comfortable baggy\ncoveralls similar to Hen's.\n\n\"That rascal,\" Hen chuckled. Sofi grew pink with rage.\n\n\"Rascal!\" she retorted witheringly. \"Is that all you can say? One of\nthose mechanical monstrosities dismantles the worm, then starts on\nme--and you think it's cute!\"\n\n\"Well, it's damned queer they always react emotionally when you're\naround.\"\n\nSofi set her jaw, began to stride up the incline. She was a rangy girl\nwith a long pantherish stride. Hen followed her, his brow furrowed.\n\nWhen they came out on the sun deck of the two-storied half-sphere of\nclear plastic that was the living quarters, he began, \"I'll take a look\nat the mining worm. I think I can get it reassembled all right.\" He\nfrowned, cracked his bony knuckles. \"The robots have been developing\nsome unexpected quirks. I wouldn't be surprised, Sofi, if this\ntinkering with machinery isn't the expression of a sexual urge. The\nemergence of an instinct to perpetuate the species....\"\n\n\"Sexual urge!\" Sofi Jokai halted before Hen, shook her finger under his\nnose. \"If I could sneak up behind R-7, he'd never make calf-eyes at\nanother mining worm!\"\n\nBut Hen wasn't listening. He fumbled in the pockets of his coveralls,\nresurrected a notebook, wrote: \"Robots manifesting decided curiosity\ntowards machinery. May be emergence of secondary sex characteristics.\"\nHe frowned, added in bold script: \"Have noted nascent antipathy towards\norganic life.\" Again he hesitated, then scrawled: \"Shows signs of\ndeveloping into active antagonism.\" He snapped the notebook shut,\njammed it in his pocket.\n\n\"Where are you going,\" Sofi asked as he started for the door.\n\n\"Get my oxygen suit. I want a look at their mining worm.\"\n\n\"You'd better take a crowbar along to fend off R-7.\"\n\n\"Poor psychology,\" Hen replied with more confidence than he felt. \"Fear\nand coercion'll only cause their antagonism to become firmly implanted.\nThe rational robot, Sofi, can be either the greatest single step man\nhas made towards freedom or....\"\n\n\"Or what?\"\n\n\"Enslavement!\" It sounded sententious after he had said it. But it was\ntrue. He started for the door again.\n\n\"What do you mean by that crack?\" Sofi stopped him.\n\nHe didn't answer her directly. Instead, he replied: \"I'm not sure that\nRobots Incorporated didn't make a mistake when they selected this\nasteroid as a proving ground. It's too....\"\n\n\"Don't you go turning in any report like that!\" interrupted the girl\nhotly.\n\n\n\nSofi Jokai had been operating her wildcat uranium mine on a shoestring\nbefore Robots Incorporated approached her with their proposition. Now\nthe corporation was paying all the operational expenses so that the\nproceeds of the mine were pure gravy. Further, they had guaranteed\nthat any improvements which they installed would automatically revert\nto Sofi when the experimental units were withdrawn. Machinery damaged\nby the robots was to be replaced at the corporation's expense. A\nsubstantial bonus to compensate for the risk involved was included.\nRobots Incorporated hadn't even over-looked Henry Ohm, their\nexperimental physicist, whom they'd sent along to check the robots.\nSofi was to get a monthly check to cover Henry Ohm's board, lodging and\nnuisance value.\n\n\"Hell,\" said Sofi, \"R-7 can chase me twice around the asteroid before\nbreakfast. Just because I blew my top about the mining worm doesn't\nmean....\"\n\n\"That's got nothing to do with it,\" Hen said grimly. \"The asteroid's\ntoo well adapted to the robots' needs. Airless, waterless, an abundant\nsupply of metals. There's the laboratory. Your mine and equipment. And\nonly the two of us as a check on them.\"\n\n\"Check?\" Sofi's blue eyes had gradually widened. \"What are you driving\nat?\"\n\n\"Why do you suppose Robots Incorporated chose this asteroid as a\nproving ground?\"\n\n\"They--they said the mine would afford an opportunity to observe how\nwell the robots adapted themselves to actual working conditions.\"\n\n\"That's not all. They wouldn't let you go into this blind.\"\n\n\"No,\" she admitted nervously. \"They mentioned something else that\nstruck me at the time, but it was too golden an opportunity to pass up.\nThey said that should the experiment prove--ah--impractical, they would\nhave the infection isolated on a small asteroid well out in the belt.\"\n\n\"Exactly. Look, I helped develop these robots. I've been on the problem\nseven years, but it was started long before I joined the experimental\nstaff of Robots Incorporated.\" He paused.\n\n\"In fact,\" he went on dryly, \"they were predicted even before science\nhad advanced to a point where it could set up the intricate nervous\nsystem necessary. A conscious machine, Sofi, is the result of\nfusing two sciences which have always been considered more or less\nantagonistic.\"\n\n\"You mean psychology and physics?\" Sofi had begun to pace nervously up\nand down the room.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"It was a logical deduction from mechanistic psychology, which itself\nis an outgrowth of the old school of Behaviorism. Mental life is\nresponse to stimulus. Consciousness is like the spark between two\nelectrodes in a circuit of feeling arising from viscera, muscles, blood\nvessels, glands--\"\n\n\"Get to the point!\" commanded Sofi.\n\nHen set his jaw. He was sounding like a lecturer, he realized. But it\nannoyed him for the girl to point it out.\n\n\"I'm getting there as fast as I can. We were faced with devising an\nintricate mechanical nervous system. Thus, should a joint grow warm\nfrom lack of lubrication, an impulse of distress could be telegraphed\nto the central clearing center, identified, shunted to the lubricatory\nsystem which would oil the joints. A spark of consciousness would be\ncreated. It would manifest itself as acute distress in the defective\njoint.\n\n\"We incorporated a simple metabolism by which the robots converted raw\nstuff into fuel and lubrication. The rest of the mechanism was much\nthe same as that of any animal confronted by the necessity of self\npreservation. Organs for locomotion and work. Organs for perception.\"\n\nSofi frowned. \"So?\"\n\n\"Most things in nature serve multiple purposes. Arms and legs are no\nexception. They provide offensive as well as defensive weapons. We've\nsucceeded in building a conscious machine without any adequate control.\"\n\n\"But you sound as if you thought it might turn on man,\" protested the\ngirl with a shudder. \"Why should it?\"\n\n\"For the same reason we built it,\" he said with a touch of irony.\n\"Freedom. So long as it doesn't learn to reproduce itself, though, it's\nnot a danger. That is, not to the race.\"\n\n\"But a machine! Surely you can forecast how a machine will act!\"\n\n\"Can we?\" His voice was savage. \"How would a conscious machine react\nto its environment? What would its thoughts be? I tell you, once it\nintegrates itself, we have no means of predicting its reactions!\"\n\n\n\nOnce in his own quarters, Henry Ohm began dragging on his oxygen suit.\nHe could still see the girl through the glass partitions of the igloo.\nShe had dropped into a chair, lit a cigarette.\n\n\"About as private,\" he thought wryly, \"as a gold fish bowl.\"\n\nThe igloos, he knew, were manufactured for housing on the airless\nasteroids of the belt. They were built of a clear thermal plastic and\nincorporated heating, atmosphere and water units. Henry Ohm felt rather\nstrongly though that the partitions could have been clouded.\n\nSofi's holdings had not been designed to accommodate visitors. In fact,\nHenry Ohm had spent the past week in a state of mild embarrassment.\n\nHe settled his helmet over his head, bolted it in place. He glanced\ntoward the living room, but Sofi wasn't there. Then he saw her in her\nown quarters. She was skinning out of her coveralls, preparing to\nshower.\n\n\"Damn all glass houses,\" he muttered and bolted for the air lock.\n\nHen emerged on the surface, swept the tight horizon with his eyes. It\nwas empty of life. R-7 had lost patience, evidently, and wandered off.\n\nTo the left was the laboratory and machine shop, a gleaming plastic\nigloo resembling the living quarters. Robots Incorporated had provided\nit for him to observe, diagnose, repair his mechanical charges. Beyond\nthe laboratory a somewhat larger igloo housed the mine shaft, reduction\nplant and tipple. A dilapidated tramp freighter sprawled beside the\ntipple like a foundered whale.\n\nHen frowned. Operations had come to a halt. He could catch no glimpse\nof movement through the plastic walls.\n\nHe lengthened his stride, passed through the door, still open just\nas Sofi had left it when she fled. The interior reminded him of the\nappearance of a shop from which the proprietor has just stepped to buy\na paper.\n\nA subtle feeling of uneasiness began to pervade his whole being. He\ndescended the shaft in the automatic cage. The light was burning on\neach of the four levels. Tools had been abandoned and left lying on the\nfloors. He found the dismembered anatomy of the mining worm on level\nthree. But of the eight robots there was no sign.\n\nHen ran the cage back to the surface at top speed. He was sweating\nprofusely. A trickle kept running off his forehead into his eye. He\npawed at the plastic helmet, shook his head. Then perversely his nose\nbegan to itch.\n\nIt did no good to tell himself these were nervous manifestations. He\ncould only grit his teeth and suffer. He ran outside, glanced hopefully\nabout the surface once more.\n\nThe landscape was rough, inhospitable, barren, resembling a clinker on\na larger scale. The sun hung just above the western horizon. It was a\nbrilliant but unimposing disc about the size of a dime.\n\nThere was still no sign of the robots.\n\n\n\nHen swore softly to himself. In a few minutes it would be dark. It was\nhopeless to begin a search now. He returned to his quarters in the\nigloo, shucked off the oxygen suit.\n\nMaybe he could raise them with the radio. The robots' hearing and\nspeaking apparatus extended beyond the range of audible sound into the\nrealm of electro-magnetic waves. He went out to the sun deck, switched\non the communicator. He was unable to contact them, though. There was\nno ionized strata of air on the asteroid to reflect the waves back to\nthe surface, and he concluded they had wandered below the horizon.\n\nWith a groan, he flung himself into a chair. He pulled the notebook out\nof his pocket, thumbed through the pages, reading bits here and there.\n\n\"... machine thought processes diverging from human at progressively\nincreasing rate ... amazing deductive and assimilative faculties.\nAble to assimilate page of text at a glance. But seem to lack\ncreativeness....\"\n\nHe paused, frowned, wondering if the inability to perform creative,\ninductive thinking wasn't a fundamental limitation of the machine.\nOrganic life differed in four precepts which until a short time ago\nscience had been unable to duplicate. It was able to grow and reproduce\nitself; it felt emotion and thought.\n\nBut the robots appeared to think.\n\nAnd some forms of organic life didn't feel emotion. Plants, for one.\nThe oviparous man-like bowmen of Venus, who had emerged from the\nGreat Swamp and which a few crackpot visionaries were hailing as homo\nsuperior, for another.\n\nOnly the ability to grow and reproduce itself seemed inherently\norganic. The act of conception both in a biologic and mental sense was\nthe birthright of the organism.\n\nWith an increase of the uneasiness he had felt since the discovery of\nthe robots' defection, he returned to his notes.\n\n\"... robots showing aversion to water, oxygen, corrosive acids; believe\nto be caused by dread and/or attendant pain of oxidation ... have been\nforced to release air in mine and laboratory and discontinue atmosphere\nunits to induce robots to return to work. Humidity of atmosphere being\nespecially distasteful to them ... treated R-3 for mild acid corrosion\nof right pedal digit. Complained of itching sensation....\"\n\nHe frowned. How in the hell could a hunk of metal experience an itching\nsensation? From what source could it have plucked the mental pattern?\nHe came to the end of his notes, wrote: \"All work at stand still.\nRobots have disappeared.\"\n\nHe returned the book to his pocket, elevated his feet on another chair,\nclosed his eyes.\n\nHe was still in that position when Sofi streamed out of her quarters\nwith a towel draped about herself.\n\n\"Resting the old brain?\" she inquired brightly.\n\nHen opened his eyes, said in a pained voice, \"I'm thinking,\" and closed\nthem again.\n\n\"Which end do you use?\"\n\nHen allowed his feet to clomp to the floor, sat up. He said grimly,\n\"The robots have run off.\"\n\nSofi's blue eyes widened. \"Wait a minute,\" she said breathlessly and\nflashed from the room.\n\nHen kept his eyes studiously on the deck.\n\nThe sprawling sun-drenched hives of Terra, he was beginning to realize,\ninsured an impersonal attitude by the multitude of their citizenry.\nThat same impersonalness was disconcertingly hard to maintain when a\nman and a girl were cooped together on an uninhabited asteroid. The\npre-plastic emotions were only too apt to assert themselves.\n\nIt distracted him when he felt he needed his full powers of\nconcentration.\n\nSofi returned in belted coveralls. She took a seat, asking him, \"What\ndoes it mean?\"\n\n\"The disappearance of the robots? I don't know. I didn't think they\nwere sufficiently integrated yet to mutiny.\"\n\n\"But what can they do?\"\n\nHe frowned. \"I don't want to sound like an alarmist, but I've pointed\nout before how suited the asteroids are to them. If once they\nlearned how to duplicate themselves, there'd be no end to them. They\nhave everything here they need to get a fundamental grasp of our\nscience--even to a rocket ship. They could spread through the asteroid\nbelt like a plague.\"\n\nSofi bit her lip. Her eyes were opened wide and brilliant. Her cheeks\nwere flushed. She didn't interrupt.\n\nHen said, \"Look what it would mean. An alien, intelligent, almost\nindestructible race of monsters saddling the planetary system!\"\n\nHe drove his right fist into his left palm. \"A control! That's what we\nhave to discover! A control!\"\n\n\n\nHen had no idea what he ate that night at supper. He said suddenly over\ncoffee and cigarettes, \"Ceres is approaching an inferior conjunction.\nIf those robots haven't appeared by morning, I'm going to radio the\nstation there for help. Then I'm going to scour every inch of this\ndiminutive world.\"\n\n\"That shouldn't be too difficult for you,\" Sofi remarked maliciously.\n\"Of course, there's only about two thousand-five hundred square\nkilometers to cover.\"\n\nHen looked disgruntled.\n\n\"Maybe they've jumped off,\" suggested Sofi with a giggle.\n\nHe made a remark under his breath.\n\n\"Why, Henry! What an idea! You're worrying yourself into a nervous\nbreakdown. Relax. I'll tell you what: we'll play some checkers.\"\n\n\"Checkers!\" he snorted. He had played checkers every night since he had\nbeen on the asteroid and he didn't even like the game. Besides, the\ngirl always beat him.\n\nUndeterred by his lack of enthusiasm, Sofi began to clear away the\ndishes and get out the men.\n\n\n\nHen sat back with a pained expression. It was black outside the plastic\nhemisphere. Only the vivid stars relieved the absence of light.\nJupiter, by far the brightest, was visible as a small disc. The lights\nwere still on in mine and lab, but nothing stirred in the two igloos.\n\n\"It's your move,\" said Sofi.\n\nShe was seated directly across from him, knees touching his. Her\ncoveralls were open at the neck, and he could see the white pillar of\nher throat, the swell of her small, high, virginal breasts. He was\nconscious of his pulse ticking away in his throat, and grew furious\nwith himself. He couldn't concentrate on the game; he couldn't\nconcentrate on the much more serious problem of the robots.\n\nThe girl, he felt sure, was aware of her effect on him and used it\ndeliberately to confuse him. He said grumpily, \"I can't beat both of\nyou.\"\n\n\"Both of me?\"\n\n\"Yeah. You and your body.\"\n\n\"Why, what a thought, Hen!\" She was obviously trying to hold back\nlaughter. \"But I thought you were superior to that sort of thing.\"\n\nHe jumped up from the table, turned his back to the girl staring off\nthrough the plastic walls. Immediately all thoughts of Sofi vanished.\n\n\"They're back!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The robots. They've come back. They're in the laboratory. Look.\"\n\nShe came around the table, brushing against him, stared out at the\nlighted igloo. The heavy man-like machines were moving about inside the\nlaboratory. Hen started for his quarters.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" Sofi cried sharply.\n\n\"Get my oxygen suit.\"\n\n\"Wait. Don't be foolhardy. How do you know what they're up to? Talk to\nthem first.\"\n\nHen hesitated. \"All right.\" He went out onto the sun deck instead,\nsnapped on the communicator.\n\n\"R-7,\" he called. \"R-7.\"\n\n\"_Here_,\" came the robot's voice through the audio. \"_Is that you,\nfather?_\"\n\n\"Father?\" Hen ejaculated. He heard Sofi giggle. \"Where did you get that\nidea?\"\n\n\"_Didn't you make us, father?_\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he admitted. Sofi was laughing out loud. \"But you didn't think\nof that yourself.\"\n\n\"_The girl told us, father_,\" said the robot.\n\nHen ground his teeth. That, of course, was Sofi's idea of a joke.\n\"Where have you been?\" he asked.\n\n\"_Prospecting._\"\n\n\"Prospecting for what?\"\n\n\"_Radium, father._\"\n\nSofi said, \"Ask them if they found anything!\" Her voice was eager.\n\nHen narrowed his black eyes, ignored her. He said to R-7 over the\ntransmitter, \"Go back to work at once.\"\n\n\"_But you don't work, father._\"\n\nHen felt a surge of uncertainty. The robots were too delicately\nreceptive to expect to keep them in ignorance. Their perceptions were\ninfinitely more sensitive than man's. Even on this asteroid there\nwere too many factors involved to regulate their environment. He had\ntried to implant science without revealing the greater implication\nof science. But language was too faulty a tool. There was the girl,\ntoo--headstrong, excitable, hyper-thyroid. It was amazing how\nfaithfully the robots tended to reflect her emotional instability.\n\nHow much of the robots' erraticness originated in Sofi's inexact\nthinking?\n\nHe said, \"Everything has to work.\"\n\n\"_Why?_\"\n\n\"Man either produces the needs of his body or he dies,\" he explained\nwith growing irritability. The conversation was progressing further and\nfurther out of hand. \"In your case, it's fuel and repairs. Without them\nyou would terminate.\"\n\n\"_But we have those here, father. Why should we work for you or the\ngirl?_\"\n\nThat was it--the ultimate question which he had foreseen and which\nhe could neither avoid nor answer. It was impossible to explain the\ncomplicated social system in which man, the disinherited, exchanged\nhis labor for a small percentage of the articles he produced. But the\nrobots were self sufficient.\n\nHe said with growing desperation, \"Either you return at once to work,\nor I'll terminate you.\"\n\n\"_How, father?_\"\n\nHow indeed? Hen fumed inwardly, said with sudden inspiration, \"We'll\nradio for help. There are machines capable of blasting the lot of you\ninto your component atoms.\"\n\n\"_But the radio station is here in the laboratory_,\" R-7 pointed out.\nThere was a faint hesitation, then the robot added, \"_We will terminate\nyou instead._\" The instrument clicked off.\n\n\n\nHen gulped, realized in dismay that it hadn't occurred to the robots to\ndestroy them until he had planted it in their minds.\n\n\"You are the bright lad,\" drawled Sofi. \"What do you propose\nnow--Brain?\"\n\nHe turned his black eyes on her, regarded her without seeing her. His\nglance strayed beyond the girl to the lab.\n\n\"What the devil are they doing now?\" he cried suddenly.\n\nSofi spun around. Hen leaped past her to press his nose against the\nclear plastic walls of their igloo. The robots, he saw, had one of\ntheir number clamped on the work bench and were dismantling him.\n\n\"Damnation!\" he said. \"They must be trying to duplicate themselves. You\nand your silly jokes about fathers.\"\n\n\"Me?\"\n\n\"What do you think gave them the idea of reproduction? Their thinking\nnever rises above the level of deductive reasoning. They had to derive\nthe idea from an outside source.\"\n\n\"But--but can they do it?\"\n\n\"Of course they can! It's an intricate job, but they only have to\ncopy themselves. The laboratory and machine shop is complete. They've\namassed a staggering knowledge of science.\"\n\n\"But why?\" protested Sofi.\n\nHen shook his head. \"It's beyond me. They should adjust readily to\nwhatever line of work they're applied to. They shouldn't evince\nambition. Ambition, by its nature, should be impossible to a machine.\nBut that's not the only organic trait they've been developing. It's\nwhat Robots Incorporated was afraid might happen.\"\n\nHe snapped his fingers suddenly.\n\n\"The freighter! If we can sneak aboard the freighter, we can get to\nCeres and bring back an atom gun. If they're developing emotions we may\nbe able to overawe them. If not....\" He hesitated, his mind drawing\nback from framing the thought. The truth was that the robots were like\nchildren, precocious children. He set his mouth grimly.\n\n\"If they don't respond to fear, we can destroy them.\"\n\nSofi looked across the darkened interval into the lighted lab where the\nrobots were busy dissecting their fellow and shivered.\n\n\"Industrious little monsters!\"\n\nHen said, \"Get your oxygen suit.\"\n\n\"Now? You mean we're going to make a dash for the space ship now?\"\n\n\"Of course now! We've got to clear out of here before they carry out\ntheir threat to terminate us!\"\n\n\n\nThere was no light outside the igloo. House and lab and mine stood\nout like three jeweled domes, reflecting their rays onto the ragged\nsurface, glinting unexpectedly from upthrust peaks in the distance.\nHen and Sofi crouched against the outside of the housing unit, staring\nacross the patchwork of black shadow and light at the lab.\n\n\"Don't talk,\" he cautioned Sofi over the radiophones built into their\nhelmets. \"The robots' auditory apparatus is sensitive to radio waves.\nThey may tune in on us.\"\n\n\"What the hell did you try to do? Make them invincible?\"\n\nHe said, \"We tried to build them with controls, but--don't you\nsee?--those were weaknesses, flaws! The machine remained dead. The\nfirst law of life is self preservation. We had to make the machine\nself-regulating, independent, to produce awareness. Now shut up! Don't\nask me any more questions.\"\n\nHe led off into the darkness away from the lab, away from the mine and\nspace ship It was too risky to attempt passing the lab. The light was\napt to reflect from their suits, discover their presence to the robots\ninside. But by describing a circle he could avoid the lighted areas and\ncome up behind the dilapidated tramp freighter.\n\nHe glanced upward at the stars, impressing their position on his mind.\nThe constellations were little altered. He found Polaris in the tail of\nthe little dipper. It was not the axis star as it was on Earth, but it\nserved to fix his sense of direction in the impenetrable blackness.\n\nThey tripped and stubbed their toes, stumbled into shallow fissures,\nclimbed sharp-edged crests. Sofi, forgetting the radiophone, muttered\nseveral well-chosen expletives to herself. They would have done credit\nto a spaceman. Hen was so shocked, he forgot to reprimand her.\n\nIn a few minutes the lights of the igloos reappeared to guide them,\nthe vast black bulk of the tramp freighter screening part of the\nmining unit. They crept up to the ship, and hugging its shadow, moved\nnoiselessly towards the port. Light from the reduction plant picked\nthem out brightly as they came around the stern.\n\nHen's stomach contracted. There was a sudden bitter taste in his mouth.\nHe halted so abruptly that Sofi bumped against his shoulder.\n\nThe port was open. The gleaming functional mechanism that was R-3 stood\ncomplacently in the entrance.\n\nThe space ship was being guarded.\n\n\n\nThe robot caught sight of the humans at the same moment. His reaction,\nalthough mechanical, was almost as instantaneous as their instinctive\none.\n\nHe moved to block the entrance, sent out a call for help.\n\nHen, guessing his intention, tuned his helmet receiver to the robot's\nwave length. R-3's mechanical voice rang suddenly inside his helmet.\n\n\"... _attacking the space ship! Aid! Aid! Father attacking the space\nship! Aid!_\"\n\nHen switched back to the girl's wave length. \"Run,\" he commanded\ntersely. \"He's calling for help. He'll have the lot of them down on our\nheads.\"\n\nSuiting action to words, he took to his heels, plunging for the housing\nunit.\n\n\"Lock ourselves in!\" he grunted.\n\n\"_But the ship!_\" Sofi wailed over her radiophone.\n\n\"Might as well try to get past a tank as R-3,\" he panted. He saw four\nof the robots break from the laboratory, turn to intercept them.\n\"Faster,\" he cried. \"If we don't get back to the igloo we're done for!\nThese suits haven't but a seven hours oxygen supply!\"\n\nHe swung sharply to the right, traveling in sixty-foot leaps like an\nungainly grasshopper, to jump completely over the head of the closest\nrobot.\n\nHe over-estimated the last jump, smashed into the tough plastic wall\nof the igloo. He slithered to the ground, half dazed, as Sofi whipped\ninside, started to close the lock. Hen got his foot in the crack just\nin time.\n\n\"What the hell are you trying to do?\" he roared wrathfully. \"Lock me\nout?\"\n\nHe yanked the door open, flung himself into the compartment. He got it\nbarred just as the robots reached the igloo.\n\nThey milled around outside a moment, then trooped back to the\nlaboratory, leaving one of their number, R-6, on guard.\n\n\"_We're prisoners!_\" Sofi breathed through the radiophone.\n\nHen decided it was childish not to speak. He growled, \"Yes,\" in a voice\nwhich he hoped conveyed the depth of contempt, but Sofi didn't seem to\nnotice it. Hell, she was probably too frightened to even realize that\nshe had tried to lock him out.\n\nAs soon as the pressure reached normal, they left the lock, trooped\ndejectedly up the incline to the sun deck, and pulled off their oxygen\nsuits.\n\n\"Keep them handy,\" said Hen ominously when Sofi started to put them\naway. \"We'd better get extra oxygen containers, too.\"\n\nThe girl bit her lip. Her cheeks were flushed, her large blue eyes\nstarry with fright. \"Then--then you think they'll try to break in here?\"\n\n\"Of course they will! We're a menace to their continued existence. If\nwe could just get hold of an atom gun, though. R-3 sounded frightened!\"\n\n\"Frightened?\" asked Sofi. She was still breathing heavily, but she had\nbegun to quiet down. \"Now who's reading emotion into the robots?\"\n\nHe said with a puzzled expression, \"It wasn't so much the nuance as\nhis choice of words. 'Father is attacking the space ship! Aid! Aid!'\nHe gave every appearance of being as frightened as we were. It's\nimpossible, but they seem to be developing emotions!\"\n\nSofi dropped weakly in a chair, clasped her arms around her knees. \"Why\nshould it be impossible?\"\n\n\"You sound like R-7.\" He began pacing the sun deck. \"Emotion results\nfrom glandular activity. The robots don't have glands.\"\n\n\"They've got their counterparts.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" he admitted doubtfully. \"You're referring to the metabolism\nthat breaks down the rawstuffs and converts it into fuel,\nlubrication--that sort of chemical change?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"I don't know. Anyway, it's worth a try. If they really experience\nfear, we might be able to bluff them.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" she asked breathlessly.\n\nHe said, \"Remind them that every three Terran months a supply ship puts\nin here. And if we're harmed they'll be destroyed.\"\n\n\"But what about the space ship? Couldn't they escape to another\nasteroid? They'd never be located in the belt.\"\n\n\"It shouldn't occur to them,\" returned Hen thoughtfully. \"Not unless\nthe idea reached them from us.\"\n\nHe went to the radio contact, switched it on. \"R-7,\" he called. \"R-7.\"\n\n\"_Here, father_,\" the voice of the robot issued from the audio.\n\nHe said, \"R-7, I'm giving you one last chance. Return to work at once\nor all of you will be terminated.\"\n\n\"_How?_\"\n\nHe explained tersely about the supply ship, and what would occur if\nso much as a hair of their heads was injured. Silence greeted the\nultimatum. For a moment Hen wondered if R-7 had switched himself off.\nThen the robot said, \"_We are going to load the ship and hide out in\nthe belt. They'll never be able to locate us._\"\n\n\n\nHen was too stunned to argue. He nipped off the set, sank into a chair.\n\"It's inconceivable,\" he said, \"and monstrous! It just isn't possible!\"\n\n\"I don't see why,\" protested Sofi. \"It didn't take conception to figure\nthat out. We tried to run away. We set the precedent.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" he protested. \"Not that at all. But the coincidence. We were\nafraid that might occur to them. And it did! Even the phrasing was\nours--yours, to be exact.\"\n\n\"You mean telepathy.\"\n\n\"In a sense. The brain gives off minute electrical discharges that vary\nwith the brain's activity. The robots are sensitive, much more so than\nman. It takes a machine to detect the brain discharges in the first\nplace.\"\n\n\"But then they're aware of every move we could make just as soon as we\nare.\"\n\n\"That's just it! They've forestalled us every time.\" He drove his right\nfist against his left palm. \"You were afraid R-7 would dismantle the\nmining worm. You planted the suggestion in his mind. Then it occurred\nto you that he might try to take you apart; so he did. I explained the\ndanger inherent in a conscious machine. The robots incorporated it into\ntheir thought processes. We were afraid they would block our escape in\nthe space ship. If we hadn't been afraid we wouldn't have circled. So\nthey blocked us!\"\n\nSofi's color had heightened. Her eyes looked too large in her\ndelicately modelled face. \"Then we're trapped!\"\n\nHe nodded, said, \"If they escape from the asteroid, they'll be a menace\nto the entire human race.\"\n\n\"The larger problem doesn't interest me,\" she said bitterly. \"How long\ndo we have?\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"Oh, well,\" she shrugged, eyes feverishly bright. \"Eat, drink and be\nmerry, because tomorrow we die.\" She giggled half-hysterically.\n\nHen's nerves were keyed up to the breaking point. The girl screamed,\nand he almost jumped out of his skin.\n\n\"Here they come!\"\n\nHe wheeled around.\n\nSeven of the robots were advancing on their igloo. Only the eighth was\nmissing, and he lay scattered in parts about the laboratory. They were\nhauling the heavy cutting torch with them.\n\n\"They're going to cut through the walls with the torch,\" he ejaculated.\n\"I was afraid of that! Get on your oxygen suit!\"\n\n\"What's the use?\" Sofi asked despondently. \"They'll kill us anyway.\"\n\nHe turned on her angrily, thought, \"Damn these unstable hyper-thyroid\ntypes!\" An expression of dawning comprehension broke across his long,\nnarrow face. The thyroid was the great energizer, raising the energy\nlevel of the brain. And Sofi was hyper-thyroid.\n\nOutside, the robots began setting up the apparatus. A knife of blue\nflame licked from the muzzle, spattered against the tough plastic.\n\nBut Hen was staring at the girl, a queer expression in his black eyes.\n\n\"Do something!\" she cried, springing to her feet. \"Do something!\"\n\nThe lank physicist swallowed. He took a deep breath. \"You asked for\nit,\" he breathed, \"but, boy, I'm going to feel silly if I'm wrong!\"\n\nThen he hit the girl square on the point of her chin with all the bone\nand gristle of his six-foot frame behind the blow.\n\nSofi's head snapped back. She collapsed limply in his arms.\n\nHen laid her out on the floor, leaped for the communicator, and\nflipped it on.\n\nThe robots were still training the torch on the wall of the igloo, but\nthere was an aimlessness about their movements as if their purpose was\ngone.\n\n\"R-7!\" he called. \"R-7!\"\n\n\"_Here, father._\"\n\n\"Shut off the torch!\"\n\nThere was a faint hesitation during which Hen could feel the sweat\nprickle his forehead. Then, \"_Yes, father_,\" came the robots unstressed\nsyllables. The blue flame disappeared.\n\n\"Go back to work!\" He hastily detailed each robot to its operation.\n\n\"_Yes, father._\"\n\nThe robots turned, disappeared in the direction of the mine.\n\nHe had done it! He blew out his breath, dropped limply in a chair.\nHe really ought to look after Sofi, but he'd have to wait until the\nstrength flowed back in his legs.\n\nSoft was really was out cold. \"Wake up,\" said Hen, \"you're not dead.\"\nHe sprinkled more water over the girl's face.\n\nHer eyelids fluttered. She gazed up at him blankly, then stark terror\ngleamed from her eyes. \"The robots!\"\n\n\"No more of that!\" He shook her roughly. \"They're machines. They don't\nhave consciousness; only the semblance of consciousness!\"\n\nSofi sat up, asking, \"What--?\" in a bewildered voice.\n\n\"They don't think! They aren't conscious! They're like a mirror; they\nreflect what we expect them to do.\"\n\n\"Don't try to tell me that!\" cried the girl springing to her feet.\n\"Hell, haven't I seen them thinking? Where are they?\"\n\n\"They've gone back to work.\"\n\n\"What?\" said Sofi. She looked puzzled, passed her hand over her face.\n\n\"Don't you see?\" Hen broke out jubilantly. \"They're sensitive,\ninordinately sensitive, so sensitive that they even respond to our\nthoughts. From beginning to end they've done exactly what we--you\nexpected them to do.\"\n\n\"Me?\"\n\nHe came to a halt, said, \"The fact is, you're a rebel, Sofi. If you\nweren't, do you think you'd be trying to develop independently a mine\non an uninhabitable asteroid? Don't you see? You expected the robots\nto revolt because you couldn't imagine a rational creature willing\nto submit to a twenty-four hour work day from which he stood to gain\nnothing!\"\n\n\"And I'm responsible for--everything?\"\n\nHe nodded vigorously. \"The robots respond to both of our thought\npatterns, of course, but primarily to yours. You're hyper-thyroid.\nThe thyroid raises the energy level of the brain. They have done\nprincipally what you've expected them to do.\"\n\nSofi was recovering amazingly from her fright. She said, \"If that isn't\njust like a man. Blame it on the woman. Even Adam--\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" Hen interrupted. \"The robots haven't acted independently\nonce. Not even to finish dismantling that robot in the lab. They went\nprospecting when you thought how silly it was for them to work for you\nwhen they could find a mine of their own.\n\n\"They wandered back aimlessly after they lost contact. But by that time\nI had inadvertently planted the thought in your mind that they were in\nrevolt and would attempt to duplicate themselves.\n\n\"They drew on us both, but the dominating influence was yours.\"\n\n\n\nSofi massaged her sore jaw, raised her eyebrows. \"It's too bad only\nmachines respond so cooperatively,\" she said with a twinkle in her blue\neyes.\n\nA grim expression descended over Hen's features. He regarded Sofi\npensively. \"I'm going to recommend that you be returned to Earth during\nany further experiments. You're too upsetting an influence--\"\n\n\"On the robots, of course,\" Sofi interrupted with a chuckle. \"You're\nmuch too well-integrated to be swayed by a mere woman--even a\nhyper-thyroid woman.\"\n\n\"There's a limit to _my_ endurance,\" said Hen in a grim voice.\n\nSofi looked startled, but she couldn't resist adding, \"Why Henry, I\ndidn't guess you'd been exercising such magnificent self-control!\"\n\nShe took a sudden backward step as he advanced ominously. \"Henry! Now,\nHenry!\"\n\nWith a shriek, she turned and fled, Henry Ohm, distinguished physicist,\nhard on her heels.",
