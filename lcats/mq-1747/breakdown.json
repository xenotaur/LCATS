    "body": "He didn't know exactly when it had started, but it had been going on\nfor weeks. Edna begged him to see the doctor living in that new house\ntwo miles past Dugan's farm, but he refused. He point-blank refused to\nadmit he was sick _that_ way--in the head!\n\nOf course, a man could grow forgetful. He had to admit there were\nmoments when he had all sorts of mixed-up memories and thoughts in his\nmind. And sometimes--like right now, lying in bed beside Edna, watching\nthe first hint of light touch the windows--he began sweating with fear.\nA horrible, gut-wrenching fear, all the more horrible because it was\nbased on nothing.\n\nThe chicken-run came alive; the barn followed minutes later. There were\nchores to do, the same chores he'd done all his forty-one years. Except\nthat now, with the new regulations about wheat and corn, he had only\na vegetable patch to farm. Sure, he got paid for letting the fields\nremain empty. But it just didn't seem right, all that land going to\nwaste....\n\n_Davie. Blond hair and a round, tanned face and strong arms growing\nstronger each day from helping out after school._\n\nHe turned and shook Edna. \"What happened to Davie?\"\n\nShe cleared her throat, mumbled, \"Huh? What happened to who?\"\n\n\"I said, what....\" But then it slipped away. Davie? No, that was part\nof a dream he'd had last week. He and Edna had no children.\n\nHe felt the fear again, and got up fast to escape it. Edna opened her\neyes as soon as his weight left the bed. \"Like hotcakes for breakfast?\"\n\n\"Eggs,\" he said. \"Bacon.\" And then, seeing her face change, he\nremembered. \"Course,\" he muttered. \"Can't have bacon. Rationed.\"\n\nShe was fully awake now. \"If you'd only go see Dr. Hamming, Harry. Just\nfor a checkup. Or let me call him so he could--\"\n\n\"You stop that! You stop that right now, and for good! I don't want to\nhear no more about doctors. I get laid up, I'll call one. And it won't\nbe that Hamming who I ain't never seen in my life! It'll be Timkins,\nwho took care'n us and brought our son into the world and....\"\n\nShe began to cry, and he realized he'd said something crazy again. They\nhad no son, never had a son. And Timkins--he'd died and they'd gone to\nhis funeral. Or so Edna said.\n\nHe himself just couldn't remember it.\n\nHe went to the bed and sat down beside her. \"Sorry. That was just a\ndream I had. I'm still half asleep this morning. Couldn't fall off last\nnight, not till real late. Guess I'm a little nervous, what with all\nthe new regulations and not working regular. I never meant we had a\nson.\" He waited then, hoping she'd say they _had_ had a son, and he'd\ndied or gone away. But of course she didn't.\n\n\n\nHe went to the bathroom and washed. By the time he came to the kitchen,\nEdna had hotcakes on a plate and coffee in a cup. He sat down and ate.\nPart way through the meal, he paused. \"Got an awful craving for meat,\"\nhe said. \"Goddam those rations! Man can't even butcher his own stock\nfor his own table!\"\n\n\"We're having meat for lunch,\" she said placatingly. \"Nice cut of\nmulti-pro.\"\n\n\"Multi-pro,\" he scoffed. \"God knows what's in it. Like spam put through\na grinder a hundred times and then baked into slabs. Can't hardly taste\nany meat there.\"\n\n\"Well, we got no choice. Country's on emergency rations. The current\ncrisis, you know.\"\n\nThe way she said it irritated him. Like it was Scripture; like no one\ncould question one word of it without being damned to Hell. He finished\nquickly and without speaking went on out to the barn.\n\nHe milked and curried and fed and cleaned, and still was done inside\nof two hours. Then he walked slowly, head down, across the hay-strewn\nfloor. He stopped, put out his hand as if to find a pole or beam that\nwas too familiar to require raising his eyes, and almost fell as he\nleaned in that direction. Regaining his balance after a sideward\nstaggering shuffle, he looked around, startled. \"Why, this ain't the\nway I had my barn....\"\n\nHe heard his own voice, and stopped. He fought the flash of senseless\npanic. Of course this was the way he'd had his barn built, because it\n_was_ his barn!\n\nHe rubbed his hard hands together and said aloud, \"Get down to the\npatch. Them tomatoes need fertilizer for tang.\" He walked outside and\ntook a deep breath. Air was different, wasn't it? Sweet and pure and\nclean, like country air always was and always would be; but still,\ndifferent somehow. Maybe sharper. Or was sharp the word? Maybe....\n\nHe went quickly across the yard, past the pig-pen--he'd had twelve\npigs, hadn't he? Now he had four--behind the house to where the\nhalf-acre truck farm lay greening in the sun. He got to work. Sometime\nlater, Edna called to him. \"Delivery last night, Harry. I took some.\nPick up rest?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he shouted.\n\nShe disappeared.\n\nHe walked slowly back to the house. As he came into the front yard,\nmoving toward the road and the supply bin, something occurred to him.\n_The car._ He hadn't seen the old Chevvy in ... how long? It'd be nice\nto take a ride to town, see a movie, maybe have a few beers.\n\nNo. It was against the travel regulations. He couldn't go further than\nWalt and Gloria Shanks' place. They couldn't go further than his. And\nthe gas rationing. Besides, he'd sold the car, hadn't he? Because it\nwas no use to him lying in the tractor shed.\n\n\n\nHe whirled, staring out across the fields to his left. Why, the tractor\nshed had stood just fifty feet from the house!\n\nNo, he'd torn it down. The tractor was in town, being overhauled and\nall. He was leaving it there until he had use for it.\n\nHe went on toward the road, his head beginning to throb. Why should\na man his age, hardly sick at all since he was a kid, suddenly start\nlosing hold this way? Edna was worried. The Shanks had noticed it too.\n\nHe was at the supply bin--like an old-fashioned wood bin; a box with\na sloping flap lid. Deliveries of food and clothing and home medicines\nand other things were left here. You wrote down what you needed, and\nthey left it--or whatever they allowed you--with a bill. You paid the\nbill by leaving money in the bin, and the next week you found a receipt\nand your new stuff and your new bill. And almost always you found some\nmoney from the government, for not planting wheat or not planting corn.\nIt came out just about even.\n\nHe hauled out a sack of flour, half the amount of sugar Edna had\nordered, some dried fruit, a new Homekit Medicine Shelf. He carried it\ninto the house, and noticed a slip of paper pinned to the sugar bag. A\ntelevision program guide.\n\nEdna hustled over excitedly. \"Anything good on this week, Harry?\"\n\nHe looked down the listings, and frowned. \"All old movies. Still only\none channel. Still only from nine to eleven at night.\" He gave it to\nher, turned away; then stopped and waited. He'd said the same thing\nlast week. And she had said the films were all new to her.\n\nShe said it now. \"Why Harry, I've never seen this movie with Clark\nGable. Nor the comedy with Red Skeleton. Nor the other five neither.\"\n\n\"I'm gonna lie down,\" he said flatly. He turned and stepped forward,\nand found himself facing the stove. Not the door to the hall; the\nstove. \"But the door....\" he began. He cut himself short. He turned and\nsaw the door a few feet to the left, beside the table. He went there\nand out and up the stairs (they too had moved; they too weren't right)\nand into the bedroom and lay down. The bedroom was wrong. The bed was\nwrong. The windows were wrong.\n\nThe world was wrong! Lord, the whole damned world was wrong!\n\n\n\nEdna didn't wake him, so they had a late lunch. Then he went back to\nthe barn and let the four cows and four sheep and two horses into the\npastures. Then he checked to see that Edna had fed the chickens right.\nThey had only a dozen or so now.\n\nWhen had he sold the rest? And when had he sold his other livestock?\n\nOr had they died somehow? A rough winter? Disease?\n\nHe stood in the yard, a tall, husky man with pale brown hair and a face\nthat had once been long, lean and strong and was now only long and\nlean. He blinked gray eyes and tried hard to remember, then turned and\nwent to the house. Edna was soaking dishes in the sink, according to\nregulations--one sinkful of dishwater a day. And one tub of bath water\ntwice a week.\n\nShe was looking at him. He realized his anger and confusion must be\nshowing. He managed a smile. \"You remember how much we got for our\nlivestock, Edna?\"\n\n\"Same as everyone else,\" she said. \"Government agents paid flat rates.\"\n\nHe remembered then, or thought he did. The headache was back. He went\nupstairs and slept again, but this time he had dreams, many of them,\nand all confused and all frightening. He was glad to get up. And he was\nglad to hear Walt and Gloria talking to Edna downstairs.\n\nHe washed his face, combed his hair and went down. Walt and Gloria were\nsitting on the sofa, Edna in the blue armchair. Walt was saying he'd\ngotten the new TV picture tube he'd ordered. \"Found it in the supply\nbin this morning. Spent the whole day installing it according to the\nbook of directions.\"\n\nHarry said hi and they all said hi and he sat down and they talked\nabout TV and gardens and livestock. Then Harry said, \"How's Penny?\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Gloria answered. \"I'm starting her on the kindergarten book\nnext week.\"\n\n\"She's five already?\" Harry asked.\n\n\"Almost six,\" Walt said. \"Emergency Education Regulations state that\nthe child should be five years nine months old before embarking on\nkindergarten book.\"\n\n\"And Frances?\" Harry asked. \"Your oldest? She must be starting\nhigh....\" He stopped, because they were all staring at him, and because\nhe couldn't remember Frances clearly. \"Just a joke,\" he said, laughing\nand rising. \"Let's eat. I'm starved.\"\n\n\n\nThey ate in the kitchen. They talked--or rather Edna, Gloria and Walt\ndid. Harry nodded and said uh-huh and used his mouth for chewing.\n\nWalt and Gloria went home at ten-fifteen. They said goodbye at the\ndoor and Harry walked away. He heard Gloria whispering something about\nDoctor Hamming.\n\nHe was sitting in the living room when Edna came in. She was crying.\n\"Harry, please see the doctor.\"\n\nHe got up. \"I'm going out. I might even sleep out!\"\n\n\"But why, Harry, why?\"\n\nHe couldn't stand to see her crying. He went to her, kissed her wet\ncheek, spoke more softly. \"It'll do me good, like when I was a kid.\"\n\n\"If you say so, Harry.\"\n\nHe left quickly. He went outside and across the yard to the road. He\nlooked up it and down it, to the north and to the south. It was a\nbright night with moon and stars, but he saw nothing, no one. The road\nwas empty. It was always empty, except when Walt and Gloria walked over\nfrom their place a mile or so south. But once it hadn't been empty.\nOnce there'd been cars, people....\n\nHe had to do something. Just sitting and looking at the sky wouldn't\nhelp him. He had to go somewhere, see someone.\n\nHe went to the barn and looked for his saddle. There was no saddle. But\nhe'd had one hanging right behind the door. Or had he?\n\nHe threw a blanket over Plum, the big mare, and tied it with a piece of\nwash line. He used another piece for a bridle, since he couldn't find\nthat either, and didn't bother making a bit. He mounted, and Plum moved\nout of the barn and onto the road. He headed north, toward town.\n\nThen he realized he couldn't go along the road this way. He'd be\nreported. Breaking travel regulations was a serious offense. He didn't\nknow what they did to you, but it wasn't anything easy like a fine.\n\nHe cut into an unfenced, unplanted field.\n\nHis headache was back, worse now than it had ever been. His entire\nhead throbbed, and he leaned forward and put his cheek against Plum's\nmane. The mare whinnied uneasily, but he kicked her sides and she moved\nforward. He lay there, just wanting to go somewhere, just wanting to\nleave his headache and confusion behind.\n\nHe didn't know how long it was, but Plum was moving cautiously now. He\nraised his head. They were approaching a fence. He noticed a gate off\nto the right, and pulled the rope so Plum went that way. They reached\nthe gate and he got down to open it, and saw the sign. \"Phineas Grotton\nFarm.\" He looked up at the sky, found the constellations, turned his\nhead, and nodded. He'd started north, and Plum had continued north.\nHe'd crossed land belonging both to himself and the Franklins. Now he\nwas leaving the Franklin farm. North of the Franklins were the Bessers.\nWho was this Phineas Grotton? Had he bought out Lon Besser? But\nanything like that would've gotten around.\n\nWas he forgetting again?\n\n\n\nWell, no matter. Mr. Grotton would have to excuse his trespass. He\nopened the gate, led Plum through it, closed the gate. He mounted and\nrode forward, still north, toward the small Pangborn place and after\nthe Pangborns the biggest farm in the county--old Wallace Elverton's\nplace. The fields here, as everywhere in the county, lay fallow. Seemed\nas if the government had so much grain stored up they'd be able to get\nalong without crops for years more.\n\nHe looked around. Somehow, the country bothered him. He wasn't sure\nwhy, but ... everything was wrong.\n\nHis head weighed an agonized ton. He put it down again. Plum went\nsedately forward. After a while she stopped. Harry looked up. Another\nfence. And what a fence! About ten feet of heavy steel mesh, topped by\nthree feet of barbed-wire--five separate strands. What in the world had\nSam Pangborn been thinking of to put up a monster like this?\n\nHe looked around. The gate should be further west. He rode that way.\nHe found no gate. He turned back, heading east. No gate. Nothing but\nfence. And wasn't the fence gradually curving inward? He looked back.\nYes, there _was_ a slight inward curve.\n\nHe dismounted and tied Plum to the fence, then stepped back and figured\nthe best way to get to the other side.\n\nThe best way, the only way, was to claw, clutch and clamber, as they\nused to say back when he was a kid.\n\nIt took some doing. He tore his shirt on the barbed wire, but he got\nover and began walking, straight ahead, due north. The earth changed\nbeneath his feet. He stooped and touched it. Sand. Hard-packed sand.\nHe'd never seen the like of it in this county.\n\nHe walked on. A sound came to him; a rising-falling whisper. He\nlistened to it, and looked up every so often at the sky, to make sure\nhe was heading in the right direction.\n\nAnd the sand ended. His shoes plunked over flooring.\n\nFlooring!\n\nHe knelt to make sure, and his hand felt wooden planks. He rose, and\nglanced up to see if he was still outdoors. Then he laughed. It was a\nsick laugh, so he stopped it.\n\nHe took another step. His shoes sounded against the wood. He walked.\nMore wood. Wood that went on, as the sand had. And the roaring sound\ngrowing louder. And the air changing, smelling like air never had\nbefore in Cultwait County.\n\n\n\nHis entire body trembled. His mind trembled too. He walked, and came to\na waist-high metal railing, and made a tiny sound deep in his throat.\nHe looked out over water, endless water rolling in endless waves under\nthe night sky. Crashing water, topped with reflected silver from the\nmoon. Pounding water, filling the air with spray.\n\nHe put out his hands and grasped the railing. It was wet. He raised\ndamp fingers to his mouth. Salt.\n\nHe stepped back, back, and turned and ran. He ran wildly, blindly,\nuntil he could run no more. Then he fell, feeling the sand beneath him,\nand shut his eyes and mind to everything.\n\nMuch later, he got up and went to the fence and climbed it. He came\ndown on the other side and looked around and saw Plum. He walked to\nher, mounted her, sat still. The thoughts, or dreams, or whatever they\nwere which had been torturing him these past few weeks began torturing\nhim again.\n\nIt was getting light. His head was splitting.\n\nDavie. His son Davie. Fourteen years old. Going to high school in\ntown....\n\n_Town!_ He should've gone there in the first place! He would ride east,\nto the road, then head south, back toward home. That would bring him\nright down Main Street. Regulations or not, he'd talk to people, find\nout what was happening.\n\nHe kicked Plum's sides. The mare began to move. He kept kicking until\nshe broke into a brisk canter. He held on with hands and legs.\n\nWhy hadn't he seen the Pangborns and Elvertons lately--a long time\nlately?\n\n_The ocean. He'd seen the ocean. Not a reservoir or lake made by\nflooding and by damming, but salt water and enormous. An ocean, where\nthere could be no ocean. The Pangborns and Elvertons had been where\nthat ocean was now. And after the Elvertons had come the Dobsons.\nAnd after them the new plastics plant. And after that the city of\nCrossville. And after that...._\n\nHe was passing his own farm. He hadn't come through town, and yet here\nhe was at his own farm. Could he have forgotten where town was? Could\nit be north of his home, not south? Could a man get so confused as to\nforget things he'd known all his life?\n\nHe reached the Shanks' place, and passed it at a trot. Then he was\nbeyond their boundaries and breaking regulations again. He stayed on\nthe road. He went by a small house and saw colored folks in the yard.\nThere'd been no colored folks here. There'd been Eli Bergen and his\nfamily and his mother, in a bigger, newer house. The colored folks\nheard Plum's hooves and looked up and stared. Then a man raised his\nvoice. \"Mistah, you breakin' regulations! Mistah, the police gonnah get\nyou!\"\n\n\n\nHe rode on. He came to another house, neat and white, with three\nchildren playing on a grassy lawn. They saw him and ran inside. A\nmoment later, adult voices yelled after him:\n\n\"You theah! Stop!\"\n\n\"Call the sheriff! He's headin' foah Piney Woods!\"\n\nThere was no place called Piney Woods in this county.\n\nWas this how a man's mind went?\n\nHe came to another house, and another. He passed ten all told, and\npeople shouted at him for breaking regulations, and the last three or\nfour sounded like Easterners. And their houses looked like pictures of\nNew England he'd seen in magazines.\n\nHe rode on. He never did come to town. He came to a ten-foot fence with\na three-foot barbed-wire extension. He got off Plum and ripped his\nclothing climbing. He walked over hard-packed sand, and then wood,\nand came to a low metal railing. He looked out at the ocean, gleaming\nin bright sunlight, surging and seething endlessly. He felt the earth\nsway beneath him. He staggered, and dropped to his hands and knees, and\nshook his head like a fighter hit too many times. Then he got up and\nwent back to the fence and heard a sound. It was a familiar sound, yet\nstrange too. He shaded his eyes against the climbing sun. Then he saw\nit--a car. _A car!_\n\n\n\nIt was one of those tiny foreign jobs that run on practically no gas at\nall. It stopped beside him and two men got out. Young men with lined,\ntired faces; they wore policemen's uniforms. \"You broke regulations,\nMr. Burr. You'll have to come with us.\"\n\nHe nodded. He wanted to. He wanted to be taken care of. He turned\ntoward Plum.\n\nThe other officer was walking around the horse. \"Rode her hard,\" he\nsaid, and he sounded real worried. \"Shouldn't have done that, Mr. Burr.\nWe have so very few now....\"\n\nThe officer holding Harry's arm said, \"Pete.\"\n\nThe officer examining Plum said, \"It won't make any difference in a\nwhile.\"\n\nHarry looked at both of them, and felt sharp, personal fear.\n\n\"Take the horse back to his farm,\" the officer holding Harry said. He\nopened the door of the little car and pushed Harry inside. He went\naround to the driver's side and got behind the wheel and drove away.\nHarry looked back. Pete was leading Plum after them; not riding him,\nwalking him. \"He sure must like horses,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Am I going to jail?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Where then?\"\n\n\"The doctor's place.\"\n\nThey stopped in front of the new house two miles past Dugan's farm.\nExcept he'd never seen it before. Or had he? Everyone seemed to know\nabout it--or was everyone only Edna and the Shanks?\n\nHe got out of the car. The officer took his arm and led him up the\npath. Harry noticed that the new house was big.\n\nWhen they came inside, he knew it wasn't like any house he'd ever seen\nor heard of. There was this long central passageway, and dozens of\ndoors branched off it on both sides, and stairways went down from it in\nat least three places that he could see, and at the far end--a good two\nhundred yards away--a big ramp led upward. And it was all gray plaster\nwalls and dull black floors and cold white lighting, like a hospital,\nor a modern factory, or maybe a government building. Except that he\ndidn't see or hear people.\n\nHe did hear _something_; a low, rumbling noise. The further they came\nalong the hall, the louder the rumbling grew. It seemed to be deep down\nsomewhere.\n\n\n\nThey went through one of the doors on the right, into a windowless\nroom. A thin little man with bald head and frameless glasses was there,\nputting on a white coat. His veiny hands shook. He looked a hundred\nyears old. \"Where's Petey?\" he asked.\n\n\"Pete's all right, Dad. Just leading a horse back to Burr's farm.\"\n\nThe old man sighed. \"I didn't know what form it would take. I expected\none or two cases, but I couldn't predict whether it would be gradual or\nsudden, whether or not it would lead to violence.\"\n\n\"No violence, Dad.\"\n\n\"Fine, Stan.\" He looked at Harry. \"I'm going to give you a little\ntreatment, Mr. Burr. It'll settle your nerves and make everything....\"\n\n\"What happened to Davie?\" Harry asked, things pushing at his brain\nagain.\n\nStan helped him up. \"Just step this way, Mr. Burr.\"\n\nHe didn't resist. He went through the second door into the room with\nthe big chair. He sat down and let them strap his arms and legs and let\nthem lower the metal thing over his head. He felt needles pierce his\nscalp and the back of his neck. He let them do what they wanted; he\nwould let them kill him if they wanted. All he asked was one answer so\nas to know whether or not he was insane.\n\n\"What happened to my son Davie?\"\n\nThe old man walked across the room and examined what looked like the\ninsides of a dozen big radios. He turned, his hand on a switch.\n\n\"Please,\" Harry whispered. \"Just tell me about my son.\"\n\nThe doctor blinked behind his glasses, and then his hand left the\nswitch. \"Dead,\" he said, his voice a rustling of dried leaves. \"Like so\nmany millions of others. Dead, when the bombs fell. Dead, as everyone\nknew they would be and no one did anything to prevent. Dead. Perhaps\nthe whole world is dead--except for us.\"\n\nHarry stared at him.\n\n\n\n\"I can't take the time to explain it all. I have too much to do. Just\nthree of us--myself and my two sons. My wife lost her mind. I should\nhave helped her as I'm helping you.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Harry said. \"I remember people, and things, and\nwhere are they now? Dead? People can die, but farms, cities....\"\n\n\"I haven't the time,\" the doctor repeated, voice rising. \"I have to run\na world. Three of us, to run a world! I built it as best I could, but\nhow large could I make it? The money. The years and years of work. The\npeople calling me insane when they found out ... but a few giving me\nmore money, and the work going on. And those few caught like everyone\nelse, unprepared when the holocaust started, unprepared and unable to\nreach my world. So they died. As I knew they would. As they should have\nknown they would.\"\n\nHarry felt the rumbling beneath him. Engines?\n\n\"You survived,\" the doctor said. \"Your wife. A few hundred others in\nthe rural areas. One other family in your area. I survived because\nI lived for survival, like a mole deep in the earth, expecting the\ncatastrophe every minute. I survived because I gave up living to\nsurvive.\" He laughed, high and thin.\n\nHis son said, \"Please, Dad....\"\n\n\"No! I want to talk to someone _sane_! You and Petey and I--we're all\ninsane, you know. Three years now, playing God, waiting for some land,\nany land, to become habitable. And knowing everything, and surrounded\nby people who are sane only because I made sure they would know\nnothing.\" He stepped forward, glaring at Harry. \"Now do you understand?\nI went across the country, picking up a few of the few left alive. Most\nwere farmers, and even where some weren't I picked the farmers anyway.\nBecause farmers are what we'll need, and all the rest can evolve later.\nI put you and the others, eighty-six all told, from every section of\nthe country, on my world, the only uncontaminated land left. I gave\nyou back your old lives. I couldn't give you big crops because we\ndon't need big crops. We would only exhaust our limited soil with big\ncrops. But I gave you vegetable gardens and livestock and, best of all,\n_sanity_! I wiped the insane moments from your minds. I gave you peace\nand consigned myself, my sons, my own wife....\"\n\nHe choked and stopped.\n\nStan ran across the room to the switch. Harry watched him, and his\nbrain struggled with an impossible concept. He heard the engines and\nremembered the ocean on two sides; on four sides had he bothered to\ncheck south and east; on _all_ sides if that fence continued to curve\ninward. Ocean, and there was no ocean in Iowa.\n\nAnd this wasn't Iowa.\n\n_The explosions had ripped the world, and he'd tried to get to town to\nsave Davie, and there'd been no town and there'd been no people and\nthere'd been only death and poison in the air and even those few people\nleft had begun to die, and then the truck with the huge trailer had\ncome, the gleaming trailer with the little man and his trembling wife\nand his two sons...._\n\n\n\nSuddenly, he understood. And understanding brought not peace but the\ngreatest terror he'd ever known. He screamed, \"We're on....\" but the\nswitch was thrown and there was no more speech. For an hour. Then he\ngot out of the chair and said, \"Sure glad I took my wife's advice and\ncame to see you, Doctor Hamming. I feel better already, and after only\none.... What do you call these treatments?\"\n\n\"Diathermy,\" the little doctor muttered.\n\nHarry gave him a five-dollar bill. The doctor gave him two singles in\nchange. \"That's certainly reasonable enough,\" Harry said.\n\nThe doctor nodded. \"There's a police officer in the hall. He'll drive\nyou home so there won't be any trouble with the travel regulations.\"\n\nHarry said, \"Thanks. Think we'll ever see the end of travel regulations\nand rationing and all the rest of the emergency?\"\n\n\"You will, Mr. Burr.\"\n\nHarry walked to the door.\n\n\"We're on an ark,\" the doctor said.\n\nHarry turned around, smiling. \"What?\"\n\n\"A test, Mr. Burr. You passed it. Goodbye.\"\n\nHarry went home. He told Edna he felt just great! She said she'd been\nworried when an officer found Plum wandering on the road; she thought\nmaybe Harry had gone off somewhere and broken travel regulations.\n\n\"Me?\" he exclaimed, amazed. \"Break travel regulations? I'd as soon kill\na pig!\"",
