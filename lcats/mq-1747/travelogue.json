    "body": "Adventure came late--at thirty-two, if the detail matters--into\nthe diffident life of Wesley Filburn, but with all the fictional\nimprobability of the wistful little fantasies he wrote for his living.\n\nIt called, in a voice Wesley failed at first to recognize because he\nhad long ago given up listening, just when he least expected it--when\nhe was walking one late April afternoon along the rocky banks of\nSampson's Creek, temporarily blind to the drowsy mountain charm of the\nplace while he mulled over an inconsistency that niggled at his current\nplot-line.\n\nThere was this utopian little planet, he mulled, that circled the\nmajor sun of a binary star named Aldhafera (no other star would do;\nthe name _Aldhafera_ was perfect, too laden with the romance of the\nstarways to surrender) upon which his space-roving protagonist was to\ndiscover his true self--and the glory of the One Love inevitable to\nevery such spacefaring gallant--by destroying his ship and so making\nit impossible to betray Her people's unspoiled paradise to his own\ngrasping mechanical culture. The rub was, and Wesley was too honest\nto dismiss it unresolved, that any world circling one primary of a\ndouble star would very probably be something less than a paradise.\nCaught between two such stellar furnaces, it was more likely to be a\nslag-shelled inferno of heat and desolation.\n\nStill, if one sun should be very small or nearly spent, there might\nbe no problem at all. It might even offer fresh background detail as\na novel sort of moon, shedding living light upon an already exotic\nsetting. He'd have to check further on Aldhafera, though he doubted\nthat his scanty astronomical texts would supply his want.\n\nThe call, too strong for a bird's piping yet too slight and musical\nfor even a child's voice, drew him back from Aldhafera to the banks of\nSampson's Creek.\n\nIt was a child after all, but an improbably tiny one.\n\nShe floundered in a pool deep enough to drown even an adult, so\nmanifestly helpless that Wesley plunged instantly to her rescue without\narguing his own inability to swim. He had a briefest glimpse of hair\nfloating like a small silver cloud about a frightened elfin face\nwith enormous lilac eyes; then the icy pool received him and he was\nsplashing mightily to keep his own head above water.\n\nMomentum took him near enough for the child to grasp his sleeve. The\nrest, the immemorial emergency of learning to swim the hard way, was up\nto Wesley.\n\nHe made it, not because he was capable of meeting such a challenge at\na moment's notice but because the bank and safety were after all only\na few feet away. His frantic paddlings brought the two of them out, to\nlie panting and dripping side by side in the welcome heat of sunlight.\n\nWhen he had recovered enough to sit up, Wesley examined his find with\nmore amazement than satisfaction.\n\n\n\nThe child was smaller than any child could be, he thought, and turned\nout with a fragile perfection more doll-like than human. Her hair\nwas drying rapidly to look more like spun platinum than like silver;\nher dress, a mothlike wisp that changed color with mother-of-pearl\niridescence, seemed not to have been wet at all. There was a belt of\nslender metal links about her tiny waist, caught with a flattened oval\nbuckle the size of a pocket watch.\n\nHer lilac eyes, more blue than purple now with the shock gone out of\nthem, looked up at him wonderingly.\n\n\"Are you hurt?\" Wesley asked. The child winced from the sound and he\nlowered his voice, feeling like an ogre before such fragility. \"Can you\ntalk yet?\"\n\nHe reached out to help her and she caught his thumb with both tiny\nhands and stood knee-deep in grass that barely covered his own ankles.\n\nHer voice was as high and clear as a sleigh-bell. \"Clellingherif,\" she\nsaid, as if that unintelligibility settled everything.\n\nWesley considered her unhappily. It was not Adventure yet; he saw only\nthat he was saddled with a lost child who looked like a pixie and who\ntalked like a bird, and that he would very probably lose the rest of\nhis afternoon getting her off his hands.\n\nHe tried again.\n\n\"Where do you live?\" It was so unlikely that her parents might have\nmoved to Sampson City, with its insular aloofness and its once-a-day\ntrain, that he dismissed the idea at once.\n\nSecond thought heartened him briefly. \"Are your parents staying at the\ninn?\"\n\nThe \"inn\" was a rambling, seedily genteel resort catering mainly to\nretired couples and trout fishermen. He owned a half interest in it\nand lived there with his Aunt Jessica, who owned the other half and\ncontrolled both, and Miriam Harrell, who taught sixth grade at the\nSampson County school and nursed a determination to become Mrs. Wesley\nFilburn. If the child's parents were new guests of his Aunt Jessica's,\nhis problem was solved already.\n\nIt was not so simple. The child fingered the oval buckle of her belt,\nshaping a curious suggestion of pattern.\n\n\"_Mitsik_ Clellingherif,\" she said.\n\nShe caught Wesley's thumb again and as quickly as that they were no\nlonger on the banks of Sampson's Creek.\n\nThey were in a place that Wesley, for all his experience at contriving\nthe unlikely, could not have dreamed up in a month of trying. It was\nessentially a room, not large yet seemed to extend indefinitely, that\nlooked at first glance like a conservatory for exotic plants and at\nsecond like a library stocked with tables and files and endless shelves\nof books. There was a sprinkling of what might have been furniture,\nwith here and there an erect oval that could have been either mirror or\ncrystal screen.\n\nThe whole was scaled to a diminution that made Wesley feel like\nGulliver in Lilliput, and through it breathed a barely perceptible\nscent somewhere between honey-suckle and crushed mint.\n\nThe man and woman who came out of that improbable background seemed\nto Wesley's dizzied senses hardly taller than the child who held his\nthumb, but their resemblance to her was as unmistakable as their serene\nair of having the situation completely in hand.\n\nThe girl's mother took her away, making admonishing birdlike sounds.\nThe father, as if aware of Wesley's wavering control, gripped his thumb\nin turn and led him to an open expanse of soft-rugged floor large\nenough to hold them both.\n\n\"Sit down,\" he said in unexpected sleigh-bell English.\n\nWesley sat, and realized finally that Adventure had come.\n\n\n\nIt had come to him, he discovered, because the child--Mitsik--had not\nvisited a world with fish before. The fascination of a sunning trout in\nSampson's Creek had proved too much for her small caution; maneuvering\nfor a closer look had tumbled her into the pool, and her transporter\nunit did not work under water.\n\nHis rescue had placed her parents--the father's name was Clelling and\nher mother's Herif, explaining her cryptic pipings--under an obligation\nthat seemed to demand fulfillment. It was something like letting a\ngenie out of his bottle and being granted a wish, except that Clelling\nand Herif were no sort of djinni and their capacity for granting wishes\nwas strictly limited.\n\n\"A travel advisor's work is more interesting than profitable,\" Clelling\nsaid. \"But be assured that we shall offer as much as lies within our\nmeans.\"\n\nEmbarrassed, Wesley made deprecating sounds. \"I don't really want\npayment. I'm more interested in knowing how and why you're here.\"\n\nThe information was readily given. Clelling, completely telepathic\namong his own kind and nearly so with humanity--as witness his instant\ngrasp of English--anticipated Wesley's questions with answers that left\nhim dizzier than before.\n\n\"The galaxy is a more populous place than you imagine,\" Clelling said.\n\"And civilized to a degree beyond your comprehension. Transportation\nand trade among so many differing worlds is a complex business\noccupying the attention of millions. My wife and I deal in travel for\npleasure--we are what you would call tourist agents.\"\n\nA vision of seeing Aldhafera at first hand electrified Wesley. \"You're\nselling star trips _here_? On Earth?\"\n\nClelling denied it with regret. \"Your world has been under observation\nfor years by a galactic ecological group in upstate Pennsylvania,\nbut you are not ready yet. Economic and social stabilization, and\nelimination of war, must come before you can be admitted as a culture.\"\n\nWesley sighed and Clelling made hasty correction.\n\n\"Under the circumstances, that ban need not apply to you. We can offer\nhelp too with the information on galactic conditions you need to lend\nauthenticity to your writing.\"\n\nHe went to a file that nestled between two feathery flowering shrubs\nand drew out a glossy folder that glowed in three-dimensional\nillustration as if lighted from within.\n\n\"Aldhafera,\" Clelling said.\n\nWesley took it almost reverently. The binary suns of Aldhafera _did_\nhave planets--not one, as he had postulated, but five--capable of\nsupporting life. The minor sun was negligible and all but extinct,\nfurnishing precisely the exotic moon he had been considering when he\nfirst heard Mitsik piping in her pool.\n\n\"It's priceless,\" Wesley said. The text was undecipherable, but the\nphotography so perfect that his eyes misted and refused to leave it.\n\"It more than repays me.\"\n\nAnxiety dimmed his rapture. \"You did mean that I could keep it, didn't\nyou?\"\n\nClelling looked abashed. \"Of course. It's only a sort of tourist\ntravelogue.... I'll select a group of them dealing with worlds that\nmight interest you and see that our local outpost makes up English\ntranslations. They will be mailed to you as they are completed.\"\n\nHis wife appeared out of the shrub-and-file background, leading a\nchastened Mitsik, and stood beside him. Her fair head was hardly even\nwith the seated Wesley's shoulder.\n\n\"We mustn't leave Sonimuira out of the group,\" she said. Her lilac eyes\nlaughed with an inner, private amusement. \"He'll like Sonimuira.\"\n\n\"Out of this group we can offer you one physical visit to the world\nof your choice,\" Clelling said. \"Each brochure will have round-trip\ntear-off coupons attached. Bring them here when you have decided where\nyou will go.\"\n\n\"If I have the nerve,\" Wesley said. The prospect dazzled him until he\nremembered his Aunt Jessica. \"You'll still be here?\"\n\n\"This is a permanent relay point,\" Clelling told him. \"Our agency's\ngalactic transporter has been here for centuries of your time.\"\n\nThere was more, but none of it was clear to Wesley later. It seemed\nonly seconds before he was standing again on the banks of Sampson's\nCreek, perhaps a hundred yards upstream from the pool from which he\nhad fished Mitsik. But the sun hung lower over the mountains and the\nbirds were choosing perches for the night; he had been \"away,\" Wesley\nestimated, for something over an hour.\n\nIt did not occur to him until he had walked back to the inn, and\ndiscovered in the walking that he had left the Aldhaferian booklet\nbehind, that he might only have dozed during his stroll and dreamed it\nall. The dampness of his clothing reassured him--and disturbed his Aunt\nJessica and Miriam--without eliminating that doubt.\n\nStill later came the grimmer thought that he might even be losing his\nsanity. He worried about that, too upset to finish the Aldhaferian\nstory he had begun, for a week.\n\nThen the mail brought his first travelogue.\n\n\n\nCharlie Birdsall, the rural carrier, blew his horn at the gate and\nhanded over the sealed manila packet along with a letter from Wesley's\nliterary agent. Charlie was a friend from high-school days and a\nperennial bachelor who found Wesley's future appalling.\n\n\"Got a circular from some tourist bureau,\" Charlie said. \"And a letter\nfrom that agent fellow in New York. Letter's got a check for forty\ndollars in it.\"\n\nHe shook his head darkly at Wesley's worn look. \"Fellow, you better get\nsquared away before your lid slips. You can't write that wild stuff of\nyours and stand off two women at the same time. When're you going to\nlearn?\"\n\nWesley hefted his packet wistfully, wanting the privacy of his room but\nreluctant to offend Charlie by rushing off.\n\n\"I have to write,\" he said. \"And as for marrying--maybe Aunt Jessica is\nright. Maybe a man wasn't meant to live alone.\"\n\nCharlie snorted. \"How wrong can you get? Look, a bunch of us are having\na poker sit and beers tonight at Landon's service station. Why not come\ndown with me, Wes?\"\n\nWesley begged off. \"Work to do, Charlie. I haven't turned in much\nmaterial lately and my agent is getting impatient.\"\n\n\"When you wake up some morning on a leash,\" Charlie said, \"don't say I\ndidn't warn you.\" He put his car into gear and departed.\n\nIn his room, Wesley opened the letter first. There was a check for\nforty dollars, as Charlie had said, and a terse note from his agent\nthat said:\n\n    _This one just made it, as see the seedy stipend. Can you come up\n    with something fresher in the way of alien settings?_\n\n                                                               _Henry._\n\nWesley reserved answer until the packet was opened and his first\nbrochure scanned.\n\n\"I can now,\" he said.\n\nHis eyes filled and his hands shook with the beauty and the wonder of\nit. The folder was like the one he had examined at Clelling-Herif's\nway-station, but with a difference; here colors and perspective had\nbeen rescaled to suit his familiar values, and the exposition was in\nbeautifully lucid English.\n\nHe fingered the round-trip coupons at the bottom of the last page.\n\"To _see_ a place like that,\" he said reverently. \"If I only had the\nnerve....\"\n\nBut he lacked the nerve, and knew it--how ever to explain it all to\nhis Aunt Jessica?--and settled on the brochure as compensation in\nitself. It solved his difficulties with Aldhaferian story before he had\nfinished the first two pages. The second planet of Aldhafera's major\ntwin was precisely what he had needed for his space-rover's utopia, but\nwith innovations wonderful to behold.\n\nIts dominant race owned a corner on pleasant privacy that put Swift's\nLaputans, with their magnetic flying island, to shame; this world was\ndotted with air-borne masses of tiny, gas-filled aerophytes which\nmultiplied after the fashion of coral polyps to build personal estates\nof any size from a few acres to whole square miles. On these luxurious\nclouds, in sylvan groves and orchid gardens and dew-bright dells, lived\na benevolent race of humanoids further advanced in the gentle art of\nkeeping the peace with one another than humanity was ever likely to be.\n\nBelow lay an ocean world dotted with green-and-coral archipelagoes,\ninhabited by a satisfactorily savage species of non-humanoids whose\nevolutionary line had worked the flotation principle into its own\nmakeup. These monsters prowled fiercely upon the waters, following\nafter the cloud islands in the perennial hope of discovering one low\nenough to plunder.\n\nThe contrast, for Wesley's purpose, was perfect. His hero could\nland on a floating preserve, forcing it down by overload. There was\noccasion for a first-class battle with the water-walkers in which he\ncould rescue his One Love at least twice, and a crashing denouement in\nwhich the argonaut atoned for his injury by blasting his ship away\ntenantless under robot control, so saving the day for all concerned and\nmaking it forever impossible to betray Her people to his own.\n\nAbove all Wesley had at hand a wealth of detail, of color and\natmosphere unarguably convincing because it was true, that offered\nhim the idea-lode writers dream of. Ordinarily the most cautious of\nworkmen, Wesley flung himself into such an orgy of creation that the\nAldhaferian epic was reorganized, written and rewritten within three\ndays.\n\nFor Wesley, the wordage was tremendous. It ran to novelet length, and\nit was all good.\n\n\"Damned good,\" said Wesley, who was more given to mailing his\nmanuscripts in fear and trembling than in confidence.\n\n\n\nThat confidence waned during the succeeding week when Charlie Birdsall\ncontinued to drive past the inn with nothing more encouraging than a\nwave of the hand. Miriam grew more intent in her attentions as Wesley\nspent less time at his writing. His Aunt Jessica, gauging his ebbing\nresistance, put the first of her matrimonial trumps on the table.\n\nShe cornered Wesley one morning just after Miriam had driven away to\nschool in her coupe.\n\n\"It's high time you stopped mooning around with the stars, Wesley\nFilburn,\" his Aunt Jessica said, \"and took stock of yourself. You're\nthirty-two years old, you've no income except the miserable dribble you\nget from your wild stories and you've no more responsibility than a\nwild goat in the hills. It's time you settled down.\"\n\nWesley might have protested his independence, but his lifelong\nconditioning had left him too little to discover. His Aunt Jessica had\nbrought him up from childhood after the death of his parents, who had\nowned his half of the inn before him; he owed her a great deal for\nher care and affection, as he had been told often enough to remove\nany lingering doubt, and the least he could do now was heed her wiser\ncounsel.\n\n\"I'm too old and worn to keep the inn as it should be kept,\" his Aunt\nJessica went on firmly. \"I'm ready to retire and live with my widowed\nsister in California, but I can't go until you're safely settled with\nsomeone who will see that you take care of your own interests. You\ncouldn't deny me the comfortable retirement I've earned, could you?\"\n\nWesley couldn't. It occurred to him that his Aunt Jessica was only\nfifty-five and that her retirement had been provided for out of\nthe net proceeds of the inn--it had always taken his share to meet\nexpenses--but he put the ungrateful thought away guiltily. Aunt Jessica\nhad earned her retirement while he idled, too busy spinning dreams to\nattend to his trust. If he had had no Aunt Jessica to turn to--\n\n\"It's simple enough,\" his Aunt Jessica said. \"I'll move in with my\nsister as soon as you are married. Miriam is an excellent manager; the\ntwo of you should have a comfortable thing of it, the tourist trade\nholding up as it is.\"\n\n\"I suppose you're right,\" Wesley said. \"You usually are.\"\n\nMiriam _was_ a competent manager; he could picture her without strain\nwith her rimless spectacles clamped firmly on her adequate nose, meager\nlips set while she totted up their assets. Miriam was an inch taller\nthan himself and a year or two older, but such details, his Aunt\nJessica was fond of saying, mattered a fig or less. It was the heart\nthat counted.\n\n\"All that's needed,\" his Aunt Jessica finished, \"is telling Miriam.\nWill you, or shall I?\"\n\nSome spark of repressed independence made Wesley mutter, \"I'll tell\nher.\"\n\nIt was not really necessary, he found when he sat with Miriam on the\nverandah that evening and looked down over the slope of mountains\ntoward the handful of lights that marked out Sampson City. The weight\nof his decision weighed on him so heavily that Miriam, who was nothing\nif not decisive, took the initiative.\n\n\"Your Aunt Jessica is planning to retire and live with her sister in\nCalifornia,\" she said. \"Can you run the inn alone, Wesley?\"\n\n\"I doubt it,\" Wesley said. He knew he couldn't; there were too many\nprosaic but vital details, too many procurings and disbursings for his\ndreamer's nature to cope with. \"I was thinking that maybe you--\"\n\n\"Of course I will,\" Miriam said. She peered in the gloom, saw his\ntension and contented herself with patting his hand. \"I'll resign as\nsoon as school is out in June. We'll be married, and I'll look after\nthings when Miss Filburn goes to her sister's. Is that the way you want\nit, Wesley?\"\n\nWesley wondered if it was. The spring darkness below and beyond the\ninn was warm and alive, vibrant with the tantalizing nebulous promise\nthat had led him on like a will-o-the-wisp all his life without once\nrevealing itself. The romance of strange places never seen and never to\nbe seen called powerfully, a tocsin so familiar that his response was\nas much nostalgia as longing.\n\nHis Aunt Jessica joined them on the verandah, saving any need of\nfurther talk unnecessary. He had an impression, instantly rejected as\nunworthy, that she had been listening behind the screen for the outcome\nof his proposal.\n\n\"It's all settled, Miss Filburn,\" Miriam said comfortably. \"Wesley and\nI are going to be married in June.\"\n\n\n\nThe second brochure arrived next morning, again, coincidentally, with a\nletter from Wesley's agent. Terse as ever, the note said:\n\n    _Great stuff; background so convincing I dammed nearly believed in\n    it myself. Shoot me another._\n\n                                                               _Henry._\n\nWith it came a check that left Wesley faint with disbelief.\n\nThe second travelogue advertised a world vastly different from\nAldhafera's utopia. The system was Alpha Geminorum, Castor--a visual\nbinary subdivided into spectroscopic doubles, presenting a four-sun\nfamily revolving in pairs about itself, a cosmic madhouse that gave\nprecarious shelter to only one inmate.\n\nThat planet, called Turlak, was unique in the galaxy. Caught at a\nfocal point between its various primaries, it suffered every extreme\nof heat and cold, of grinding glacier and roaring volcano. Approach\nor retreat of an ascendant sun could double a visitor's weight or\nlevitate him; the air itself rushed from hemisphere to hemisphere in a\ncontinuous demoniac hurricane.\n\nThe possibilities were unlimited.\n\nOut of them Wesley contrived for an exploring party to crash under\nTurlak's freakish gravity, for a beautiful girl ecologist to be\nsnatched from the ship by the perpetual hurricane and for the\nexpedition's handsome young hydroponicist to rescue her. Because there\nwere no convenient inimical life forms on Turlak, Wesley threw in a\ncouple of logical menaces in the way of red-hot lava serpents and\nbat-winged flying crocodiles whose natural element was the rushing wind.\n\nThe following week saw this thumbnail synopsis turned into another\nnovelet, less idyllic but more hectic than the first. He handed it\nover, weighed and stamped and sealed with scotch tape, to Charlie\nBirdsall on the morning of the first Monday in May.\n\nCharlie eyed the flat packet with respect. \"Looks like you're getting\nthe range,\" he said. \"Wes, if you turn 'em out regular like this for\nthe price that last one brought, you've got it made.\"\n\nHe squinted appraisingly when Wesley made deprecating sounds. \"I'd keep\nit quiet if I was you, though. Miriam will want to renovate the inn\nafter you're married, maybe add a new wing.\"\n\nWesley stiffened. \"How did you know?\"\n\n\"The announcement was in yesterday's paper,\" Charlie told him.\n\nMiriam had wasted no time, Wesley thought. Confound it, you'd almost\nthink she was deliberately burning his bridges behind him by making the\nthing public before he could reconsider.\n\nCharlie startled him further.\n\n\"Maybe you know what you're doing, at that,\" Charlie said cryptically.\n\"Maybe you're keen enough to know a good deal when you see one, after\nall.\"\n\nHe put the car into gear and paused with a foot on the clutch. \"So busy\ntalking I nearly forgot I had another one of those tourist ads for you.\nWhat did you do, join a vacation club?\"\n\n\"In a way,\" Wesley said. \"I won't have a chance to use it, though.\"\n\n\"Tough,\" Charlie said, and drove away.\n\n\n\nTo distract resentful thought Wesley turned to his Adventure again,\nforgetting in the fascination of his third brochure that, for him,\ndoom rhymed with June. The locale this time was a planet called\nPorizinia, circling Alpha Bootis--Arcturus. No life existed upon the\nsurface of Porizinia because of her primary's tremendous heat, but\nthe subterranean world below was something else again. The planet was\nlargely igneous and so translucent, clear enough to let Arcturus light\nwith fairy luminescence the endless labyrinth of caverns and tunnels\nthat made up a nether environment all their own.\n\nThe maze was filled in its lower levels with a buried ocean that ran\nin crystal tides past coral shoals where mermaid autochthons sunned\nthemselves in the filtered glow and sang siren songs to enchant\nvisitors. Those sections passable to air-breathers were carefully\ndesignated. Wesley, fingering the round-trip coupons at the end of the\nbrochure, was startled to find himself eaten with the desire to see the\nplace at first hand.\n\nHe rejected the impulse partly because he knew the outcry his Aunt\nJessica and Miriam would set up and partly because he understood it for\nwhat it was, an instinctive groping for an escape from the catastrophe\nof June.\n\nIt was better in any case to wait, he decided, recalling the\nnear-impish look of Herif when she had promised that he would like the\nSonimuiran travelogue. What, he wondered, was Sonimuira like?\n\nBefore the Porizinian story was finished he had another note from his\nagent:\n\n    _The Turlak job went like a collector's item. They're screaming for\n    more. Can do?_\n\n                                                               _Henry._\n\nEnclosed was another check that would have made Wesley drunk with\ntriumph but for the knowledge that June was only three weeks away.\n\nThe Porizinian story was mailed. Another brochure arrived, and another;\nlife became a predictable routine; half labor, half escape. Wesley\nwrote and dreamed and talked briefly over the gate with Charlie\nBirdsall. Now and then, too tired to sit longer at his typewriter, he\nsat on the verandah at night with his Aunt Jessica and Miriam.\n\nThey did not press him now because their victory was won and their\nlaurels assured. May dwindled away, quiet as a candle; Wesley's account\nfattened in the Sampson City bank; his agent promoted an anthology of\nhis later stories and suggested a novel.\n\nWesley, in his room, laughed hollowly. Success, now that it had come,\nhad an ashy taste.\n\nThe Sonimuiran booklet arrived on the twenty-fifth of May. A\nnewly-envious Charlie Birdsall passed it to him over the gate, and a\nbombshell of disillusion with it.\n\n\"Have to admit I figured you wrong all these years,\" Charlie said. \"You\n_do_ know a good deal when you see it. Glad to see you making the most\nof it, Wes.\"\n\nWesley hefted his packet. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"You know what I mean,\" Charlie said. \"When Miss Jessica retires you'll\nreally have it made, with Miriam looking after the inn while you pull\nin big money writing.\"\n\nHe stretched his underlip with thumb and forefinger and let it snap\nback. \"It could be as good for a man with a job like mine, if he had a\nhalf interest in a place like this to begin with. I'd jump at it just\nlike you did.\"\n\nWesley was amazed and chilled. \"You'd marry for _convenience_?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Charlie said. \"There's no percentage in this romance stuff.\"\n\nHe went on in sudden confessional candor: \"Most women figure it the\nsame way. I know Miriam does--she tried to hook me when I first got\nmy job with the post office, but the odds were all hers and I wasn't\nhaving any. That was before you came to room with your aunt--and why\ndo you think she picked the inn here, anyway? Miriam's not getting any\nyounger and she's looking out for herself. I'm glad to see you've got\nbrains enough to do the same.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Wesley said. There was nothing to add to it. \"Well.\"\n\n\"Well, I better go,\" Charlie said, and did.\n\nIn his room, Wesley sat with his unopened packet in his hand and\nthought gray thoughts.\n\nIt was one thing to plod dutifully to doom because of loyalty to his\nAunt Jessica and an unwillingness to hurt Miriam, but another matter\nentirely to be maneuvered into a selfish solution of their problems.\nMiriam wanted security, however obtained. His Aunt Jessica wanted\nretirement with the income that would continue to roll in as long as\nthe inn remained under Miriam's capable hand. The two of them had\narranged it all between them as calmly as they might have made up a\ngrocery list.\n\n\"Sucker,\" Wesley said. \"If there were a way out--\"\n\nBecause there was none he let it drop and opened his latest brochure.\n\nThe planet of Sonimuira circled a star listed as Beta Aquilae,\nAlschain. Details of distance and placement meant nothing to the\nelectrified Wesley; what did register was that Herif, in venturing that\nhe would like Sonimuira, had made a galactic understatement.\n\nOne look sent Wesley headlong to town in his Aunt Jessica's car.\nReturning an hour later, he ripped his small armful of travelogues to\npieces and--except for one page that fell behind his desk--burned them\nin the backyard incinerator.\n\nThen he disappeared in the direction of Sampson's Creek.\n\n\n\nIt was not until the middle of July, when the estate was settled\nand Miss Jessica Filburn was securely domiciled with her sister in\nCalifornia and Charlie Birdsall and Miriam had married and moved into\nthe inn, that any light was shed upon Wesley's going. Then Charlie, in\nmoving out Wesley's desk to furnish a new guest room, found the final\npage of the Sonimuiran booklet and set up a cry that brought Miriam,\ndust-capped and aproned, on the run.\n\n\"This is where Wes went,\" Charlie said.\n\nMiriam pored without comprehension over the lone page. \"How do you\nknow?\"\n\n\"He got these folders all along from some vacation club,\" Charlie\nexplained. \"Must have paid his passage in advance, because this one\nhad tear-off tickets at the bottom.... Where else would he go?\"\n\nMiriam sniffed critically at a picture showing a smiling bevy of girls\ndisporting themselves against a lush semi-tropical background.\n\nCharlie took back the page. \"Can't tell where the place is, but it says\nhere that the climate is about like Samoa's, that there's no trade or\nindustry and that the population--get this!--is ninety-four and six\ntenths female. Even Wes should do all right for himself there.\"\n\n\"He'll be back,\" Miriam said. \"He can't stay long in a place as\nexpensive as that.\"\n\nCharlie snorted in disgust. \"Would he come back after having Judge\nTalbot draw up a paper leaving his bank account to Miss Jessica and his\nhalf of the inn to me, and then disappearing with nothing but a bathing\nsuit and a pair of sun glasses?\"\n\n\"He could still come back,\" Miriam said stubbornly.\n\nAn irregularity at the bottom of the page caught Charlie's eye and\nsettled the issue.\n\n\"He can't, either,\" Charlie said. \"He didn't tear out his return\nticket.\"",
