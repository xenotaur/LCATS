    "body": "The nurse at the desk of Floor 24, Ward 5, flexed a smooth, tan arm\nand looked at the hall chronometer. She sighed inaudibly. 20:13:09,\nsaid the dial. Two more hours on duty for Miss Markett Travenor,\nF-2349464-23a-10-256W-26. Which was to say that her file was Female\nnumber 2349464 in the Register of Persons, that she lived in apartment\n23 on floor 10 in building 256 on the West side of parkzone 26.\nExamination of her face and figure would have convinced you that one\nas lovely as she could have existed by accident only in the Twentieth\nCentury. Happily, however, by the year 2046 (in which she was born),\nscientific mating was no dream of a few forward-looking visionaries,\nbut a reality: she was the lovely offspring of a couple carefully\npaired.\n\nMarkett looked down from her chronometer, her green eyes darkly\nthoughtful. Dr. Ward Alfreed (M-2536478-13a-20-358E-22) was late. She\nlooked down the white-enameled corridor, then at the indicating finger\nof an elevator. It had not moved. Easily she pressed a communicator\nattached to a strap of her uniform. Immediately a voice spoke:\n\n\"Entrance hall speaking--Central Information Desk.\"\n\nMarkett snapped a button. \"Lee?\", she asked. \"Is the hotter down there\nyet?\" \"Hotter,\" in the year 2066, meant boy-friend.\n\n\"Dr. Alfreed,\" replied the voice, \"is going up now with Patient--just a\nmoment--Patient sixty-six-twenty-five.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" replied Markett, snapping off the contact. She picked a card\nfrom the full-view files before her. Patient sixty-six-twenty-five,\nPsycho Clinic. \"Marked degeneration,\" read the card. \"Cowardly\ntendencies--fear of falling, fear of floating, fear of slipping, fear\nof standing still. Three attempted suicides unsuccessful due to lack of\ncreative technique. Prognosis: doubtful. Use of Psychological Regulator\nsuggested. E. B.\" All that, and the date for the operation--today.\n\nShe rose and faced the elevator as sharp-tuned ears caught the\nalmost imperceptible hum of doors opening. Dr. Alfreed nodded\ncheerfully to her, twitched his head for her benefit toward the man\nwhose arm he was grasping. Patient sixty-six-twenty-five, no doubt,\nshe thought, glancing again at his card. Name was Clark Stevens\n(M-3972677-234a-150N-190), she saw. Tall, too, and well-built. But,\nsomehow, his posture and bearing were almost utterly lacking in\nmasculinity; at the moment he looked the role of a weak, vacillating\nsubject of a rehabilitation test, and he shocked Markett's sense of\nwhat was right and decent with his overclad body. He wore a shirt\nand trousers, seemingly improvised from a number of the one-piece,\nshort-sleeved suits worn by the world as fashion and comfort decreed.\nYet there was something about him--? She wrenched her eyes back to the\nfigure of the doctor, small, compact, and natty in leatheret bandolier.\nPity, she thought with professional coldness, must not interfere with\nher operative functions. However, the sight of Stevens could not help\nbut make her think of pictures she had seen of nurses in the old days,\nhideously overclad, their freedom of movement hampered. She, as all\nnurses of this enlightened era, wore only a bandolier, to which was\nattached a harness carrying the various items which must always be on\nher person, regulation shorts, and shoes.\n\nDr. Alfreed took the patient's card from her and scribbled notations.\nShe turned to take the patient's arm, but, with a cry of fear, he\ncowered from her.\n\n\"Now,\" she said soothingly. \"Let's come along and not have--\" she\nwas backing him into the arms of the doctor, of course. He pinioned\nthe patient, and winked at Markett. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"He's afraid\nof women too. Forgot to tell you. Let's take him in.\" And the little\ndoctor lifted the big-boned patient easily to his shoulders, holding\nhim helplessly balanced, and trotted down the enameled corridor into\na high-walled, darkish room. He dumped the psychotic into one of\nmany deep, padded chairs, and Markett promptly slapped thick, strong\nbands of a tough plastic across the man's knees and chest. Patient\nsixty-six-twenty-five began to weep.\n\nThe doctor busied himself with a little projector and screen that\nconstituted the equipment of the room. \"What reel?\" he called to\nMarkett.\n\nShe wrinkled her nose. \"Are you going to do it in one shot or work him\nup to it?\" she asked.\n\n\"One shot. Might kill him, of course. But if it doesn't, we'll have\nreclaimed a citizen--and from all accounts a good one. He used to be an\norganizer for a coal-mine before this happened to him. Pathetic, isn't\nit?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Markett, busy fastening meshes of pure copper about the\nlimbs and head of the now quiet patient. \"But how about these--these\n_swathings_ of his? Do the bus-bars have to contact his skin?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the doctor. \"We'll just turn the stuff on and see what\nhappens. It's as strong as they come--you wouldn't understand it; I've\nstudied ancient history, so it's a little clearer to me.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Markett, uncertainly, as the doctor turned off the lights\nand started the projector. She settled herself in a comfortable double\nseat, and the doctor joined her, while Experimental Reel Seven, Full\nPower, went clicking through the camera and onto the screen. But they,\nbeing otherwise absorbed, paid little or no attention to it.\n\nThe patient--sixty-six-twenty-five--whimpered and tried to scrape off\nthe copper bus-bars that confined him. Then his eyes drifted to the\nscreen, and he beheld a marvelously real landscape, not frozen in paint\non canvas but quivering with life. A rabbit started, and the patient,\nwho had never seen a rabbit, recognized the little creature, and worked\nhis jaws. There was an unfamiliar taste in his mouth, as though he\nwere champing something tough-fibred, like a woven cloth or bit of soft\nwood. He had never eaten meat, so to the still-dominant presence of his\nego there was no connotation.\n\nAs though he were slowly turning he saw the landscape move, and a\nwalled city came into view. What a walled city was he couldn't say,\nbut the words were in his brain; and quivering with rage, he wanted\nto tear down the massive bastions with his own hands, and rend the\nmailed men who were pacing the ramparts. He clenched his right fist,\nand felt the hilt of Al Azaaf, his scimitar. Slowly Roald stood up from\nthe grass and settled his greaves about his thighs. \"Rouse up, sons\nof Yggdrasil,\" he hissed fiercely, and his men--his terrible Norse,\nscourge of the coast--appeared from bushes and brakes, drawing axes\nfrom belts and fitting pikes to shafts.\n\n\"Seventy-and-nine of us there be,\" growled Roald without preamble,\n\"and of them an hundred and eighty or more. Who complains?\" There was\nsilence on the moor, save for the clank of metal as when dirk touched\nagainst breastplate.\n\nRoald grinned savagely and swept aside his long red beard to spit. \"The\nless men the more booty,\" he snarled. \"Eh? And women--?\" He laughed\ntremendously. Then, whirling his sword he roared, \"By the hammer of\nThor--_Come on_!\" Roaring wildly Roald and his red-bearded band made\nacross the common at a dead run.\n\nThere were screams from the city, and much blowing of horns. Arrows\nbegan to smack into the clayey soil about them, and Roald raised\nhis buckler. He saw the gates of the city swinging shut; yelling\ninarticulately he tore a blazing torch from the fist of a companion and\nhurled it into the knot of porters and marketmen that was struggling\nwith the heavy bar and hinges; they scattered in terror, only a second\nbefore the red demons were within the gates, slashing and clubbing\nwith keen swords and murderous axes.\n\nRoald was the spearhead of the attack, and as he and his men plowed\ncontemptuously through the rabble ... tradesmen and shopkeepers ...\nhe laughed wildly. \"Guard ho!\" he yelled. \"Who will come to do battle\nwith the chosen of Odin. The curse of Cornwall and the damned, stinking\nIsle of Britain? Guard ho!\" Slash! through the shoulder of a boy with\na pike. He drove a mailed fist into the face of a gammer who was\nstruggling aside, unwilling to leave her heavy basket of turnips behind.\n\nRoald grinned savagely in the eyes of an archer. \"Draw,\" he shouted,\nand as the Englishman reached he spitted him on the curve of Al Azaaf.\nA new blade crossed his, and with dirk and sword he ranged up and down\nthe length of a square with his foe, a dark-eyed young man who fought\nprecisely and quietly. Behind him he felt the spearhead break into bits\nand the body of the guard charged the Norse. The youth extended his\nbody in a strange thrust, and Roald cursed the queer, slim weapon he\nused--a thing like a dart with a hilt. The Viking slashed once, and the\nyouth parried. Roald slashed again, and there was the shock known to\nswordsmen as steel clashed steel. The youth was weaponless, and Roald\ncut him down where he stood, kicked the body in the ribs, then spun to\ndefend himself against an assault from a clumsy pike.\n\nThe Viking grinned savagely, and swept aside his beard. \"With this\ndraught,\" he roared to his men, \"I name this city fief to the Vikings\nand to Roald, and all its values, be they goods or women or children,\nfief also to their conquerors.\" He glared about him from the eminence\nin the walled city's central square, on the scene of desolation and\nbutchery. He stood among his Norse having left not one of the hundred\nand eighty defenders. \"_Skoal!_\" he roared, and drank.\n\nAnd Six-six-twenty-five, otherwise known as Clark Stevens\n(M-3972677-234a-150N-190), shuddered violently, stared at the screen\nthat had just run blank. \"What--?\" he began, sitting erect. \"Damn!\"\nsaid Stevens, finding himself strangely trammeled by webworks of pure\ncopper. He wrenched his hands free and tore the wires from his ankles\nand head. \"You!\" he roared at a couple snuggled in an easy chair.\n\n\"Quite recovered?\" smiled Dr. Alfreed, unfastening the plastic bands\nthat were restraining Stevens. \"A little dizzy?\"\n\nStevens glared at him, and the Doctor backed away. There was a blinding\nflash about three inches away from the doctor's chin, and he went down\nand out. The patient, rubbing his fist, squinted through the gloom\nand perceived Miss Travenor. \"Ah,\" he said gutturally. He stepped out\nof his improvised shirt and trousers; Markett saw with relief that\nhe was wearing the conventional shorts and bandolier beneath. More\nunconventional than his former attire, however, was the patient's new\nbehavior. He spurned the doctor's body with one foot and picked up the\nnurse. \"Excuse me--\" she began plaintively.\n\n\"Shut up!\" growled Stevens, slinging her over his shoulder.\n\nAnd that was that.\n\nDr. Alfreed awoke to realize that he had committed a serious breach\nof experimental technique. It had been a mistake not to observe the\nscreen during the process of rehabilitation, and it had been a grievous\nmistake not to check on the patient's reactions. He cursed softly to\nhimself when he saw clearly enough to be sure that neither patient nor\nnurse were anywhere in the room.\n\nAlfreed was a thoughtful man; he realized that, in the old days,\nsomeone would have gotten hell for a blunder of this nature and scope.\nIn the old days technical superiors would have fired the responsible\nparty for the incompetency when revealed, so Alfreed was thankful\nthat these were not the old days. But further than that he did not\nthink. Perhaps, therefore, he was the truly responsible party for what\nwas to happen to his snug little world of file numbers, ventilated\nhouses, air-conditioned clinics, amiable objectives and pneumatically\ncomplacent nurses.\n\nHe wasn't spectacularly worried, having no technical superiors to whom\nto answer. But he had failed in a social duty. Enough of his careful\nconditioning had remained to remind him of that.\n\n\"Oh, Hell!\" he swore softly, thinking of the consequences.\n\nHe reached over to his hyper-typer, banged out a full report of the\naffair and shot it into a tube system, one of whose many mouths\ngaped from a nearby wall. This, too, was routine. If anything worked\nto correct his mistakes this would. Section headquarters all over\nthe city would be semi-automatically notified, bulletins flashed to\nrural districts. Within half an hour millions of citizens would be\ninformed--_not_ alarmed--by the quick-changing public information\nscreens.\n\nAnd with a sense of duty well done he retired to his quarters on the\nsame floor and stared for a while at a forbidden bottle of wine. Then\nhe got drunk.\n\nClark Stevens carried Markett Travenor as far as the elevator door.\nGlancing back at the prostrate form of the man he had hit in the jaw\nhis eyes narrowed. Something of cold reason was coming back. Then,\nsuddenly, he became aware--but acutely--of the girl he was carrying in\nhis arms. \"Ah,\" he said. Abruptly he shifted one of his hands a trifle;\nthe girl shivered and giggled.\n\nSlowly awareness returned to Stevens. Then he let her drop to the\nfloor. She looked at him again, quizzically, like a trusting child.\nThis man, she thought, is masculine. But not with the familiar air of\nequality to which I am accustomed--but overbearingly male. A sort of\naura covered his body--she sensed something brutish, irresponsible,\nuncivilized. Everything he did confirmed this idea:\n\n\"What--?\" said the girl. She scrambled to her feet, not taking her eyes\noff Stevens.\n\nThe man shook his head dazedly. \"I won't hurt you,\" he said. \"I'm all\nright.\" He hesitated. \"I'm--different.\" Markett nodded. \"What I did\nback there in England--\" he said slowly, and paused. \"Do you know?\" he\nasked. \"Could you see what I did?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Markett. \"I should have watched and checked, but the doctor\nand I let it go.\"\n\n\"The doctor,\" said Stevens. \"The man I hit?\" She nodded, half smiling.\n\"And you'd better be getting out of here,\" said Markett. \"He might wake\nup angry.\" She pushed the button of the elevator, and the doors rolled\nopen. \"Come on,\" she said, as the man stood silently. \"You're not\nafraid any more, are you?\"\n\n\"Afraid?\" Stevens laughed. \"I was. It was something that happened in\nthe mine--\" He drew a hand across his eyes; the elevator's doors rolled\nshut, and they began their ascent to the roof.\n\n\"Explosion?\" asked Markett. \"They happen, I hear.\"\n\n\"Maybe. What the hell?\" he said, grinning happily. \"I'm here, you're\nhere, and I'm just after storming a castle in England with my Norsemen.\nIt was terrible, but somehow--I don't know. I shouldn't be proud of the\nthings I did.\" He shuddered a little. \"Killing. Maiming. And I burned\nthe town when there was nothing left I could take from it.\"\n\nThe doors of the elevator rolled open, and a flood of sunlight poured\ninto the tiny cage. \"There,\" said the man, pointing out a plane.\n\"That's the one we'll take.\"\n\n\"Did you fly here?\" asked the girl. \"I thought you were afraid.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Stevens, confidently opening the unlocked door of the plane.\n\"This doesn't belong to me.\"\n\nMarkett gasped, as her twenty-odd years of inculcated respect for\nproperty came down on her head like a ton of bricks. \"You can't!\" she\ncried. \"It isn't yours--you said so.\" Her voice trailed off as she saw\nthe baffled stare in his eyes.\n\n\"Come in,\" he offered, making room for her beside the pilot's seat.\nLimply she entered and closed the door. \"Now,\" said Stevens, \"what did\nyou say?\"\n\n\"The plane isn't yours, Clark!\" Oddly, she flushed as she called him by\nhis given name.\n\n\"Well,\" said Stevens, puzzlement written over his face, \"it is now.\"\nHe started the motor with one kick at the pedal and the plane snapped\ninto the air, hovered for a moment, and shot diagonally up, through and\nabove low-hanging cumulus clouds that glittered in the afternoon sun.\n\n\"Why did you come here?\" asked Markett. Somehow she felt safe.\n\n\"More beautiful,\" said Stevens. \"And I have plans.\"\n\n\"Plans?\" asked the girl. \"For yourself?\"\n\n\"For the world,\" said Stevens. He nodded his head over the control\nboard, and a shaft of light was caught in his hair; made it shine like\nlittle curly brass wires. \"I must ask you questions,\" said the man. \"I\nam different. Can you see it?\"\n\n\"I can,\" said the girl. And at that moment she felt that it would be a\nbetter thing for man if she were to seize the controls, send their ship\ntearing down to smash into the ground.\n\nTraffic control ship seven (for the district) swooped three times on\nthe hovering plane. Pilot Petersen scratched his head. \"What's he\ndoing?\" he asked Engineer Handel.\n\n\"I dunno. Hold it,\" said Handel, bending over his radio set.\n\n\"Report from hospital,\" said the radio. \"Psychotic escaped in\nplane. Give warnings. The plane will be identified later; its owner\nis undergoing a serious operation and no records are immediately\navailable. Be advised.\"\n\n\"That must be it,\" said Handel practically. \"He's out of all accepted\nzones and he hasn't got any right to hover over a residential district.\nCall him, Pete.\"\n\nPetersen aimed his short beam radio antenna in the general direction of\nthe disputed plane. \"Calling Monoplane of class ten,\" he said into the\nmike. \"You with the brown body and blue wings. Can y' hear me?\"\n\nHarshly a voice answered. \"We hear. What is it?\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" said the pilot, \"but you're hovering over a residential area.\nThat's not allowed. What's your number, pilot?\"\n\n\"I have no number,\" said the voice, \"and I have no license. Stand off\nor take the consequences!\"\n\n\"It's him--the psycho,\" hissed Petersen to Handel. \"Call HQ on your set\nwhile I keep him busy.\"\n\n\"Right,\" snapped the engineer, tuning in the traffic center.\n\nThe pilot turned to his set, his brow wrinkled. How do you handle a\npsycho? Humor him. \"What was that you said?\" asked Petersen, smooth as\nsilk.\n\n\"Stand off, you fool, or take the consequences! I'll give you five\nseconds to get away.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said Petersen. \"Why don't you--\" Then he gasped, as his plans\ncrumbled. The psycho's ship had winged over with terrible speed and was\nheading for his ship nose-on. \"Stop!\" he shrilled into the mike, his\nhand on the throttle. Then he sent his own plane into a loop that made\nhis bones bend, and streaked for altitude, with the demon plane and its\ndemon pilot on his tail. \"I warned you,\" ground out of the speaker.\n\"You'll do well to tell the world that there's one man alive who's\nnot afraid to kill or be killed to achieve his ends. Spread the word,\nfriend!\" And, when Petersen looked around, the plane was a vanishing\nspeck in the north, as he watched it reach the blending point and\nvanish in the sky.\n\nHandel, gibbering in a corner of the traffic ship where the last loop\nhad flung him, cried, \"What happened to it?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said the pilot soberly. \"Did you get HQ?\"\n\n\"Yes, but the loop smashed my set. What do we do now?\"\n\n\"Fly back, but fast,\" said Petersen, giving his ship the gun.\n\n\"Pete,\" said Handel.\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"What do we do with a thing like that? I mean how do you finally get\nrid of them?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said the pilot slowly. \"Lock them up once you catch\nthem, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Catch _that_? He tried to ram us! As he said--he's not afraid to kill\nor be killed.\" The engineer shuddered. \"Do you think,\" he asked, \"we'll\nhave to kill him?\"\n\nPetersen frowned. \"I hope not,\" he said, his eyes ahead of him as he\nprepared to land. \"But if there's no other way--what else can we do?\"\n\n\"How long since they killed a man--purposely, I mean?\" The ship was\nrolling to a stop.\n\n\"I dunno. Maybe a hundred years; maybe more. And who that was, I don't\nknow either.\"\n\nThe two left the plane and headed for the manager's office, their\nfaces wry. Petersen was thinking of blood. He was hoping that if they\nhad to kill the psycho they'd do it some dry, quiet way. And Handel,\nnursing a bruised lip, was hoping exactly the same thing. Mankind,\nafter many years of mutual hatreds had at last reached unanimity, and\nan idealistic one at that.\n\nThe stolen plane crashed to a halt through the brush and bracken of the\nabandoned clearing. Markett looked about her.\n\n\"Do you know where we are?\" asked Stevens.\n\n\"I think so,\" said the girl slowly. \"It must be a park district that's\nbeing allowed to lie fallow. Probably it won't be touched by anyone for\na few years. Or wouldn't have been.\"\n\nStevens stared at her. \"You mean--?\" he asked.\n\n\"I mean that in a matter of hours the world will be down on you. Sheer\nforce of numbers will make you yield to them. Oh, Clark, can't you see\nthat you're _wrong_?\" Her eyes suddenly widened with dread as she saw\nhis hands work convulsively.\n\n\"Get out,\" he ordered, and she obeyed, thinking wildly of a dash to\nsafety. Safety among the trees? Without a man to help her for perhaps\nhundreds of miles! Meekly she stood, waiting for what might happen. She\ncould not believe that her life was to end at the hands of a madman.\nShe found it hard, indeed, to believe that Stevens was mad. Confused,\nrather, by the overdose of the Regulator to which he had been subjected.\n\n\"Brave woman,\" he said. \"I see you do not fear my madness. _That_ is\nwell. You are to be my mate--no, my wife.\"\n\n\"Wife?\" she replied calmly. \"But marriages are no longer customary.\nAnd, even when they do happen, it is only through consent of the bride.\"\n\n\"All this,\" he said slowly, \"must be changed. There is no life in this\nworld, no struggle.\" He thought further. \"Men must fight--if not each\nother, as I did in England, then something bigger. We must fight now\nto bring life to this silly paradise we're in. Even if it means the\nspilling of blood.\"\n\nShe, the nurse, shuddered at the thought of blood. For radio-knife\nsurgery had made incisions a dry affair, without confusion or\ninfection. Accidents were few; many lived their entire lives without\nseeing their own blood. \"Can you do it alone?\" she asked.\n\n\"I can start alone,\" he decided. \"I shall find my warriors in the\nmad-houses and the clinics. Many of the inmates of these institutions\nare no more mad than I; they've merely been put away because they saw\nclearly, as I do.\"\n\n\"But they'll find us. They'll find you!\" she cried in sudden anguish.\n\"They'll find you! Kill you!\" Suddenly sobs choked her.\n\n\"They will forget me after awhile. They will think I was a fool and\ndrove my plane into the ground or a hillside. So I shall wait. And\nthen, when it is clear, and they have grown weary of looking, or\nexpecting an attack from me, I'll go out after my men and women.\nWe'll place them where best suited; some in transportation; some\nin utilities, and some in communication. And some with the Psycho\nRegulators. Then we strike, strike _there_, and the world is free\nagain!\"\n\nMarkett grew white as she realized that this dream of power could be\nmore than a dream. She looked up into his face, quiet now. What had\nhappened to him? Would he become more and more obsessed, more violent?\nPerhaps if she could persuade him to wait--to stay there quietly with\nher while he worked out plans--the influence of the Regulator would\nbegin to wear off.\n\nOver the course of some two hundred years the white man of North\nAmerica had lost what backwoods skill he once possessed. The little\nparty snapped twigs and stumbled over stones as they advanced through\nthe wilderness at the dead of night.\n\n\"How long?\" asked a neuro-muscular specialist.\n\n\"About ten minutes more,\" said a general practitioner.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said the specialist, who became violently sick in a bush.\nReturning he said, \"'M not ordinarily weak like this, but--\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said a civil engineer. \"It's a pretty revolting notion\nat best.\" He hefted a pick in his hand, and sighed.\n\n\"I don't see why--\" began the specialist in loud and irritated tones,\nonly to be cut off by a terrified chorus of \"shh!\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" he whispered. \"I was saying that I don't see why there aren't\nspecial bodies of men for this sort of thing. I mean, why pick men like\nus to do work we haven't studied?\"\n\n\"Haven't had the opportunity,\" said a pianist. \"And there's good\nreason why we haven't a body of men as you suggested.\"\n\n\"I can't think of it,\" whispered the specialist.\n\n\"Assume,\" said the pianist, \"that there is a group chosen--by lot, I\nsuppose--to keep in line all eccentrics like the gentlemen on whom we\nare about to call. Then how do we keep this group in line?\"\n\nThe general practitioner pondered, and, still pondering, fell into a\nbrook. \"Sorry,\" he gasped, being helped out. \"But I have the answer to\nyour question. How to keep them in line, I mean--if they misbehave you\nstop their salaries. Right?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the pianist. \"Because if they're trained to inflict\nsuffering as a negative bribe to good conduct how are we to keep\nthem from utilizing their training as a negative bribe to the end of\nexacting tribute?\"\n\nA historian unexpectedly spoke up: \"In ancient days that technique was\nknown as the 'shakedown racket'.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said the general practitioner, pondering again. \"There must\nbe some way of insuring good conduct,\" he brooded. \"Why not set up two\nrival bodies of men to check on each other?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said the specialist, now quite won over, \"they would either\njoin forces--disastrous to the common welfare--or they would struggle\nopenly for supremacy and the victor would assume that he had the\n_right_ to oppress common folk.\"\n\n\"I see,\" sighed the general practitioner. \"How much farther?\"\n\n\"As I remember it,\" said a radio engineer, \"the message came from\nthe plane as it lay half wrecked by their dwelling. That makes it\nabout--there.\" He pointed, and silhouetted in the starlight they could\nsee the outlines of a monoplane. \"Type ten,\" said a transportation\nengineer, regretfully tightening his grip on an electric drill's\nponderous bit. \"Shall we kill him first or get the girl to safety?\"\n\n\"Kill him first, I say,\" volunteered the historian. \"All in favor?\"\nThere was a soft chorus of assent. \"Well, then,\" said the historian,\n\"let's get as close as possible before he wakes up.\"\n\nStealthily they crept into the clearing and approached the little shack\nof boughs and trunks which had been flung together.\n\n\"Not bad,\" whispered a structural operator. \"Well chinked,\nventilated--in a primitive way one couldn't wish for anything better.\"\n\nThe neuro-muscular specialist took a heavy pair of operative forceps\nfrom his bandolier, and pushed on the door. It swung open after\noffering only a slight resistance. The seven others crowded into the\nlarge room and distributed themselves strategically. The pianist\nsquinted through the dark and whispered, \"There he is. I mean they\nare.\" Lying on a sort of semi-permanent bower were the two outlanders,\nside by side.\n\n\"I saw,\" whispered the transportation engineer, \"I hadn't thought it\nwas anything like _that_--\"\n\n\"He probably threatened her,\" said the specialist. \"That _must_ be it.\"\nHe raised his forceps and said uncertainly, louder than he had meant\nto, \"Well!\"\n\nAnd Clark Stevens awoke. \"Now,\" he muttered, and his eyes opened.\nLike a shot from a gun, his lean body snapped into steely action. The\nspecialist he grasped by the wrist, flung away like a rat.\n\nThere was a shrill intake of breath in the room, and the men with\nweapons poised were frozen where they stood. Every man there knew\nwhat should be done, what had to be done for the safety of their\ncivilization, and had spent time studying the use of the weapon he\ncarried. But they couldn't do it. The genteel conditioning, in which\nall thoughts of physical violence had been carefully weeded out from\nbirth, left them helpless before this man.\n\nStevens rose before them, and, in the gloom of the hut, his eyes blazed\nlike twin embers of a burning city. He uttered one inarticulate\nroar, and started for them. That galvanized them into action; they\nwere capable of as swift motion as he, but in another direction. They\ndropped their weapons and fled.\n\nStevens watched the last of them vanish, then felt a hand take his.\n\n\"They--they didn't hurt you?\"\n\nSilently he drew her through the door and their bare feet felt the loam\nof the clearing. The night wind fanned their faces. He turned to her.\n\"I made them run,\" he laughed, and she smiled. Markett was used to the\nbursts of childlike glee, and she loved her husband. He had insisted\nupon some sort of ceremony which apparently was tied up with Roald. And\nbeside the usual broad grin was a kind of shrewd, calculating glint.\n\n\"_They_ can't fight. They've forgotten how. But now they know it.\"\n\n\"Then,\" she whispered, \"we're safe.\"\n\n\"Safe,\" he repeated broodingly. \"From men, yes. But they have their\nmachines. And machines can be set to kill as well as to build. We must\nmove on.\"\n\nMarkett turned slowly and looked at the lean-to where they had been\nliving. She laughed, a little nervously.\n\n\"Strange,\" she said. \"At first I didn't like our--home. It was\nsmall--smaller than any of the apartments in the District Dwellings.\nAnd we always had to go outdoors for water--cold water that I couldn't\ndrink because it hadn't been distilled so that all the salts and taste\nhad been removed. Must we go, Clark?\"\n\nHe held her tighter. \"It was our home,\" he said, \"but we must go on!\"\n\n\n\nFar to the north, where sane men did not go, where enormous trees\nguarded the silent paths of animals to the water-hole, there was a\nfire, man-built, cunningly piled against the bole of a tree and slanted\naway from the wind so that it would burn through the long night as a\nbed of glowing embers, little tongues of blue flame leaping up now and\nagain to warn off any bear or wildcat that might seek easy pickings\namong the silent forms huddled in a circle. Men they were, big men with\ngnarled beards and knotted shoulder-muscles, sleeping restlessly and\nlightly, with one hand lying near cunningly constructed spring-guns and\nflat, gleaming backswords, into whose steel blades had been let threads\nof blue and red enamel in glowing, wide designs.\n\nThe crack of a twig broke the stillness of the forest night. With a\ngrunt, the largest of the men sat up, his fist closing tight around the\nhardwood hilt of his sword.\n\n\"Hibron?\" he called softly. \"Is it you?\"\n\nThrough the dusk strode a figure--a huge-boney male whose hair and\nbeard were like twisted, golden wires, whose loins were girded in the\npelt of a lynx, and who carried a hardwood staff a weaker man could not\nhave lifted. He thundered: \"Who're you and who d'ye take me for?\"\n\nAround the fire men sprang to their feet, gripping weapons and raising\nbows. Their leader held his sword at guard and eyed the stranger\ncoldly. \"I mistook you for a missing member of our party,\" he said.\n\"Name yourself, stranger.\" There was an angry growl from the men around\nthe fire; they advanced, their weapons twitching.\n\n\"Are you Fotchy?\" spoke up a man in the background.\n\n\"Not Hibron nor Fotchy nor any of your people,\" answered the stranger,\nsurveying them. \"I'm Clark Stevens, wildman and sworn enemy of the city\npeople. Who are you?\"\n\nThe bearded man lowered his sword. \"Come by the fire, enemy of the\nFotchy, for their enemies are our friends. Are you alone?\"\n\nStevens beckoned into a brush and a slim, firm-muscled woman dressed\nbriefly in patched remnants of cloth came forth. \"Markett, my wife,\" he\nexplained. Then to her: \"These men are our friends, but who they are,\nI do not know. They are honest people, I think. Let us sit by their\nfire.\"\n\nHe and the woman crossed their legs before the blaze, and one of the\nband piled wood on top. As the flames rose, the forest shadows were\ndriven back, and every pebble in the little clearing cast its long\nshadow on the ground. The black-bearded man seated himself before the\ntwo strangers and his people arranged themselves in council behind him.\n\n\"Selim, Stevens,\" began the leader. \"I am Isral, one of the judges\nof the clan of Hebers, expelled and hunted down by the accursed\nFotchy these seven generations and more. Are you, too, hounded by the\nmurderous, invading swine?\" The firelight gleamed on his nose and\nplayed about his curly beard and hair.\n\n\"These Fotchy,\" said Stevens slowly. \"I have never heard of them. But\nI am hounded by another kind, perhaps. I have forsworn the cities of\ngleaming metal and glass, with their tasteless water and pulpy food.\nThis I have left to live in the wilderness with my wife, and for that\nreason, they seek to kill me. These Fotchy--who were they?\"\n\nIsral spat. \"They came from over the ocean and conquered all things.\nThey imprisoned women and tortured men. Their leaders grew fat and\nluxurious while the common people were ground into the earth. The\nHebers (those who we are) were singled out for destruction, though no\none seems to know why. All this have I heard from my father, and there\nis much in the story that is strange.\n\n\"The Hebers were driven into the wilderness one winter to die, but even\nthen we were a hardy people and most of us survived the snow and sleet\nof the first season. There was trouble as the isolated people met and\nformed clans, and much struggling for power. In the midst of this they\nneglected to store up sufficient food for the next winter and many\ndied. For years--twenty, thirty, perhaps--they lived as brutes, with\nlittle more than fire to aid them. But, as a new generation grew up,\nthey learned to make things with their hands, to build crude machines,\nand to turn the laws of nature to the common welfare. And from this\ntime, we have risen in numbers and the enjoyment of life.\"\n\nIsral held up a gleaming sword. \"We work with iron and pottery and\nwood, as well as such metals as we can find in the mountains of the\nnorth; we have flocks of goats, sheep and bison. Although we live close\nto nature, we are not helpless before natural forces, though wholly\ndependent upon them. We whom you see here are a hunting party sent far\nsouth to capture living deer for breeding purposes.\"\n\nHe fell silent and stared inquiringly at Stevens, who cast his eyes\nover the man, and solemnly extended his hands. The gold-bearded man\ngrinned and said: \"You are a _real_ people. I will be your friend.\"\nFrom the group behind Isral was a pleased murmur. \"Then,\" said Isral,\n\"you will come with us to the North and live with us, and tell us all\nyou can about the world you have left. There may be much that we can\nput to good use.\"\n\n\"I will,\" said Stevens. And he was thinking, \"These men can fight!\"\n\n\n\nDr. Alfreed had begun by discussing the Stevens affair hotly in the\nMedicos Club; a colleague had mildly objected to his neglect of duty.\nAlfreed had flared up and called the colleague a dirty name. From then\nonward Alfreed's progress was spectacular. There was a challenge to\ndebate the question, and Alfreed had won hands down. His opponent had\npresented his case clearly and logically, then retired from the stage.\nAlfreed had walked on with a sneer, the subconscious necessity of\ndefending himself boiling in his breast.\n\nHis speech was like nothing that had been heard from the debating\nplatform for a hundred years or more, for he began by lashing out\nbitterly at the private life of his opponent. Patiently the audience\nwaited for him to get around to the issue in question, finding\nthemselves strangely stirred by the wild denunciation. One man yelled\nfrom the floor: \"He's right! I'm for Alfreed!\" and the cry was repeated\nin the hall.\n\nAt this the doctor frowned heavily on the audience. \"Enough of this!\"\nhe barked. \"You, my friend, have seen the menace of this wildman loose\nin our midst. I say to you: '_Hunt him down! Clark Stevens must be\ndestroyed!_'\"\n\nThe abrupt switch in logic disturbed the crowd not at all. For a\nhundred years or more they had lain fallow, ready for the first\ndemagogue who came along with a phony cause and a platform technique.\nIn a tremendous burst of enthusiasm the doctor was cheered off\nthe platform and carried through the streets in a spontaneous\ndemonstration, and the cry of the first man to rise had been mutilated\ninto \"Right for Alfreed!\" which rang all over the city by nightfall.\n\nDeposited at his doorstep the doctor made a gracious speech, referring\nto the menace of Clark Stevens, and, passing a hand before his eyes,\nbegged to be excused. Once in his apartment, Alfreed fell into a\nchair, astonished at himself. As he analyzed the matter there had\nbeen a psychological necessity to excuse his own mistake by violence\nmisdirected, or not directed at all. But it was a good thing at any\nrate. Knowing in his heart of hearts that what he told himself was not\ntrue, he pledged himself to release what he already thought of as \"his\nmen\" as soon as the menace of Stevens was eliminated. Then he went to\nbed. But all night there rang beneath his window the cry or challenge:\n\"Right for Alfreed!\"\n\nWhen he woke, it was to find that his men had been working fast,\nranging over the city, spreading the news to their friends--news of\nthis wonderful Dr. Alfreed who had emerged from public obscurity to\ndenounce the dangerous maniac who had been permitted to menace the city\nby the softlings in administrative control.\n\nHis door-signal flashed. \"Come,\" he called luxuriously from his bed.\n\"'Lo, Winters,\" he greeted an agitated colleague who strode into the\nroom.\n\n\"Alfreed,\" snapped Winters, \"how did you do it? And how are you going\nto stop them? It isn't healthy, this concentration on the death of one\nman.\"\n\n\"One ruthless, murdering maniac,\" said the doctor coldly. \"Do you call\nunhealthy the operation that removes a cancer?\" He sat up in bed and\nbrought his fist down emphatically on his knee. \"No! The day that Clark\nStevens dies I shall rest from my labors, but until then it must and\nshall be my only thought--and not mine alone but all the people in the\ncity. And those who say otherwise shall be _crushed_!\"\n\nWinters stared him in the eye. \"If you're not mad,\" he said, \"you're\ngiving a very accurate imitation of megalomania. But, for the sake of\nthe record, I assure you that I shall never be a Rightman, and that\nmany others have told me the same. Alfreed, you'll never get a majority\nin any election, so why continue a futile opposition?\"\n\nThe doctor frowned. \"Get out,\" he said. \"You will see how a _man_ gets\nwhat he wants. He _takes_ it!\"\n\nAs the door closed on Winters' back he relaxed in bed. \"_Rightman_,\"\ndid the old fool say? Not bad. Not bad at all. He leaped out of bed\nand dressed. He was nervous, almost hysterically so. As he strode down\nthe corridor of the dwelling, his friends greeted him with cries of\n\"Right!\" They were on his side, he thought.\n\nHe had to make a speech in the breakfast room of the dwelling and\nleft with the cry of \"Right for Alfreed!\" crashing in his ears. Time\nto organize now, he thought. The enthusiasm must not be allowed to\ndie down, for once cold reason was permitted to set in, his cause\nwas lost. There could be no such thing as full debate; he must imbue\nhis followers with such a sense of their truth and right that they\nwould, unthinkingly, stamp on the first murmur of opposition, without\nlistening to what the opposer had to say. Had he really been fooling\nwhen he intimated to Winters that he would take over by force? Maybe.\nHe didn't know yet. First thing the Rightmen would need, he decided,\nwould be some sort of identification. Badges--stars? No, these were\ntoo flimsy; they might get lost easily, or then some scoundrel who had\nno right to them, who did not swear allegiance to the cause, might get\nhold of them.\n\nWhat was needed was an ensign more substantial--a staff, perhaps. How\nabout a rod, he thought. A nice, heavy one, of course--it'd look better\nthat way--and it should be painted with bright colors. They could even\nwear bandoliers and shorts of the same color. Red, of course. Red stood\nout, attracted attention, and was the color of enthusiasm and violence.\nThe sight of solid red ranks would at once intimidate opposition and\nattract recruits. \"Right Red,\" it should be called. \"Right Red\" for the\n\"Rightmen.\" It is the duty, he thought, of the Rightman to defend his\nperson against irresponsible attacks, that he may be preserved for the\ngood of the state.\n\nAnd, a few hours later, these same words thundered through a microphone\nto all parts of the city: \"It is the Duty of the Rightman to defend\nhis person against irresponsible attacks that he may be preserved for\nservice to the state!\" And a thousand bright Red staffs swung up in\nsalute, while from the throats of the bearers came the chant: \"Right\nfor Alfreed! _Right! Right! RIGHT!_\"\n\n\n\nIsral pointed. \"See, Stevens, the sharpened tops of the stockade; logs\nhalf buried, upright, ten feet out of the ground showing, so close\ntogether that a rabbit couldn't squeeze through. We're safe here from\nany animal or man, I think.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Stevens, shifting his rucksack. \"It's most ingenious. But\nshouldn't you have sentries posted there by the gates?\"\n\n\"We usually do,\" said Isral, puzzled. \"I don't understand--\" He broke\noff sharply as his eyes caught something. \"Thundering heavens! _The\ngate's open!_ Somebody's going to catch hell from the judges for this.\nCome on!\" he shouted at the straggling column of men carrying, in a\nsort of palanquin cage, the live deer they had gone so far South to\ncapture. \"I can't understand it,\" he mused fretfully as he and Stevens\nand Markett ran on the double. They halted before the picketed gate and\nMarkett wrinkled her nose. \"What's that smell?\" she asked.\n\nStevens grimaced at the foul stench that drifted over the high\npalisade, and turned to Isral for an answer. The Heber had forced his\nface into lines of composure, but beneath his weather-beaten tan, his\nskin was white with shock. \"Fever,\" he said, pushing open the gate.\n\"But twice before it has come, and both times we were able to combat\nit. Now--look--\" Hopelessly he stretched forth his hand, and Stevens\nturned his head.\n\nThere was a long street of neat little houses, log houses, punctuated\nhere and there by little shops of artisans. At the end of the street\nwas a meeting-hall on which, in wood contrasting with the rough,\nunfinished logs on the outside, was nailed the six-pointed star, tribal\nsymbol of the Hebers. But the pottery wheels and grindstones and forges\nbefore the shops were untended, and there was no smoke of cooking from\nthe neat little chimneys of the houses. Lying in the street, or half\nhidden in doorways, were drawn, gaunt figures, women, children and old\npeople.\n\nWith a little cry of alarm, Markett bent over the form of a child and\nfelt its pulse and skin. \"Still alive,\" she said anxiously. \"How do you\ncombat this?\"\n\n\"A kind of berry,\" replied Isral. \"But there were none growing this\nyear when we left. They were small and bitter.\"\n\n\"I know the general type,\" said Markett. \"The bark does just as well,\nif you soak it in water. Have you any of the wood about?\"\n\n\"Here,\" replied the Heber, pointing to a bush outside the gate. \"This\nis the kind that grows the berries. And there are others in the\nforest.\" He turned to the bearers. \"You!\" he barked. \"Go pull up every\nfever-bush you can find and bring it here. You, Samel, draw clean water\nfrom the Old Well and fill some tubs. Wash them first. You three, dig a\ntrench. Some of our people are past any service save that.\"\n\n\"That settles it,\" broke in Stevens grimly. \"You can't live here any\nlonger.\"\n\n\"Why not, friend?\" asked Isral, his eyes on the men who were carrying\nout his orders.\n\n\"This sort of thing might strike you any moment. To save those who are\nstill here, we have to kill every fever-bush by uprooting and stripping\nthe bark. How many people live here?\"\n\n\"There are about two thousand in this suburb. Of these, one thousand\nmay already have died; others have fled to our other cities and towns.\nIn them, if the plague has not been spread; and we have means of\nkeeping it down if there is time for warning; we have seventy thousands\nin all.\"\n\n\"Seventy thousand,\" Stevens whispered to himself. Then, with a great\nroar, he cried: \"We'll do it!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Go South--all of us, men, women and children. We can do it\neasily--take the city from which I fled and live there, peacefully and\nhealthily.\"\n\nIsral stared at him. \"How can we take a great city of the South?\"\n\n\"Isral,\" answered Stevens, \"you don't know what has happened to men in\nthe great cities. They have become soft and helpless. A score of them,\nall armed, came after me, and fled at the first sign of opposition. A\nband of determined infants could take the city, for these city-dwellers\nare incapable of violence. What do you say to that, friend?\"\n\n\"I say,\" declared Heber slowly, \"that we'll do it!\"\n\n\n\nThe Historian faced the little group of men, sweeping the small room\nwith a glance. \"Where's Denning?\" he asked.\n\nThe General Practitioner coughed. \"The Rightmen got him,\" he said.\n\"Since Alfreed linked up the entire scientific council with what he\ncalls the subversives, none of us have been able to appear in public\nsafely. Denning's apartment was raided last night and I think he's been\nliquidated.\"\n\nThe Neuro-specialist drummed the table-top nervously. \"It's incredible\nthe way this psychopathia has spread all over the city. In three short\nmonths Alfreed and his followers have become so powerful that they do\nnot need to intimidate opposition; they're a majority.\"\n\n\"You're wrong there,\" said the Historian. \"They make a lot of noise.\nBut the investigation has shown--well, let's hear it from first hand\nsources. Would you please repeat what you told me this morning,\nGallacher?\"\n\nA tall, thin man arose. \"Despite appearance to the contrary,\" he\nbegan, \"Alfreed has only succeeded in winning over a certain part of\nthe population. Those people who have succumbed, and become Rightmen,\nare those whose social position has been such as to require a minimum\ntraining in social consciousness and responsibility, those whose\nfunctions are such to require the minimum application of intelligence.\n\n\"These people, despite the facilities that the city offers, have been\nleading very narrow, cramped lives. Their emotional attainment has been\nvery low, frustrated in many cases. Thus, the terrific emotional appeal\nof Alfreed's insane program has swept them away, made them willing\nfollowers.\"\n\n\"What,\" asked the Practitioner, \"has been the actual range of violence\nand intimidation on the part of the Rightmen?\"\n\n\"Enough to have a demoralizing effect upon the city as a whole. In\nfact, enough to make many feel insecure to such an extent that they\nwould join the Rightmen sheerly for self-protection. The cases of\nviolence against citizens, although still small in number, have been\nincreasing, and have been sufficiently ferocious to paralyze, almost\ncompletely, any attempt at public opposition.\"\n\n\"Quite right,\" agreed the Historian. \"You were correct in one sense,\"\nhe said to the Neuro-specialist. \"Alfreed does not _need_ a majority to\nwin an election, or to seize power now. He can either intimidate the\ncitizens into voting for him, or to refrain from voting at all.\"\n\n\"What has been done to combat Alfreed, without using his own methods,\nof course?\" asked an engineer.\n\n\"Rightmen have been captured by the ambulance squads, interrogated,\nthen treated with Regulators. The interesting thing is that, once\nremoved from Alfreed's influence, they return to normal very quickly,\nand a bit of Regulating makes them permanently immune.\"\n\n\"The difficulty is,\" he went on, \"that, so far, the psychopathia has\nspread more quickly than the antidote. What we must do is set machines\nto capture the Rightmen, Alfreed in particular, and regulate them. We\ncannot afford to use violence ourselves because of the deadly effects\nit has upon those involved in its use.\"\n\nThe Historian nodded. \"We must move quickly,\" he stated, \"because I\ngreatly think that Alfreed will make an open bid for full power very\nshortly. Unless there is something else to come up, gentlemen, I\nsuggest we adjourn and get to work.\"\n\n\n\nA tent camp for women, children and the animals had been pitched far\noutside the city, and the forty-thousand armed men of Heber were\nswinging down one of the great, out-moded superhighways which led into\nthe city. Overhead circled spotting planes, a vivid red in hue, marked\nwith symbols strange to the Hebers, and even to Markett and Stevens.\n\"Something must have happened in the city,\" the girl hazarded. They\ncould see it not far off, and from it issued along the highway men\nmarching in ragged file, with none of the snap and precision of the\nHebers.\n\n\"Fools!\" spat Stevens. \"If they want to reduce our numbers why don't\nthey drop weights from those planes?\" Markett was shocked. \"That's a\nvery clever idea,\" she said. \"I wonder that nobody's thought of it\nbefore.\"\n\n\"They haven't the military mind,\" said Stevens. \"Such things do not\noccur to them.\" The men from the city were drawing nearer; calmly the\nHebers unshipped their weapons, front ranks armed with spring-bows,\nrear ranks with throwing darts and the savage backswords that could cut\ndown a grizzly bear in midcharge.\n\nAn especially large plane roared overhead, and, from it, thundered a\ngreat voice. \"Halt your forces!\"\n\n\"Dr. Alfreed!\" cried Markett. \"That little fool's trying to order us\naround.\"\n\n\"Ignore that,\" advised Stevens. \"Go straight ahead. Meet that mob and\nyou won't find any resistance worth speaking of.\"\n\n\"I have arranged for everything,\" said Isral serenely. \"Quarter will\nbe given when asked; corpses will not be mutilated, and no vengeance\nfor our own casualties will be taken once resistance has stopped. We\nwill accept them as equals once we have the city in our hands.\" He\nfell silent and the tension grew as the two armies marched toward one\nanother at a steady gait. The huge red plane of Dr. Alfreed yawped\nhysterical injunctions at the advancing Hebers, who didn't even look up.\n\nThen, suddenly, there was a brief exchange of throwing-weapons and the\narmies made contact. Automatically they split up into groups, clubbing\nand slashing. Stevens waded into the thick of it, swinging a broadsword\nHe was startled to see that all the enemy were wearing vivid red shorts\nand bandoliers and were uniformly armed with heavy, short clubs.\nRemembering the timorous party that had first sought to kill him, he\nwas dazed at the savagery with which the city men came to attack, with\na suicidal disregard for their own safety and lives.\n\nFurther speculation he could not indulge in, for he was hard-pressed\nby a piquet of men who charged with strange cries of \"_Right for\nAlfreed!_\" One he spitted on his point; another's legs were cut away\nfrom beneath him, and a third landed a wild blow on Stevens' shoulder\nbefore the sizzling sweep of the backsword cut him down.\n\nStevens' head was curiously clear in the midst of the turmoil. With a\nmental start, he realized that something had happened; that this sort\nof thing no longer seemed glorious. He was not afraid; he saw it as\na necessity, but now he realized that his only desire was to get it\nover with as soon as possible and have done with violence and fighting\nfellow men. Mechanically he fell in line with a spearhead of Hebers\nand worked his way along it to the apex; there he stayed, slashing\nand parrying till a concerted attack from behind dissolved it into\nskirmishing knots of men.\n\nBut now, from the city, came forth things that made the warriors gasp\nin amazement. Metal cylinders, upright, wheeled, each equipped with\ntentacle-like projections. They bore down upon the fray, plunging into\nthe ranks of the red-clad fighters. For a moment, Stevens thought\nthem to be reinforcements, but, now, he saw that the machines were\nfor another purpose. The tentacles lashed out and seized the red-clad\nwarriors firmly, yet, it appeared, carefully, so as not to do them\nharm, and, when their arms were full, turned and made back for the city.\n\nStevens swung wide of a head that bobbed, and a red club came down on\nhis head, while another crashed into his ear. The world spun around,\nthen the ground reached up and struck him sharply. And, suddenly, it\nwas night.\n\n\"Hold your head up,\" said a voice.\n\nStevens opened his eyes. \"Markett,\" he whispered. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"Concussion. You've been unconscious for three days. And what days!\"\nShe rolled her eyes.\n\n\"Exciting? What happened?\"\n\n\"We were on the verge of losing the battle--they had us\noutnumbered--when the pursuit machines attacked the Rightmen--that's\nwhat the red-clad fighters are called. That completely demoralized\nthem, and they broke and fled back toward the city. We were almost too\namazed to know what to do, but Isral ordered us on, so we advanced\nafter them. When we were almost upon the entrance, a voice came through\ncalling me.\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"Yes. The council was watching the whole affair through tele-screens\nin the control room. They asked us what we wanted, who we were, and\nso forth. Isral and I explained, and they offered to take us in if we\nwould lay down our weapons and promise to come peacefully; if we did\nnot, they said they had a sort of gas which would make us all lose\nconsciousness.\"\n\n\"So you agreed?\"\n\n\"Certainly. You see, they explained about the Rightmen, too. The people\nwe were fighting are not the city's army; they were a sort of club\ntaking orders from Dr. Alfreed. A historian told me that it was what\nyou call a dictatorship. They had seized control of the city (although\nthe council had escaped and continued to work opposition, preparing\nthe pursuit machines, etc.) and were beating down the people, not\nallowing any freedom of speech, so when they saw that we were losing,\nthe people came out and attacked the Rightmen from behind. At the same\ntime the pursuit machines came out, because, of course, no one except\nthe council knew that there was a weapon which could be used against\nAlfreed's army.\n\n\"It was really the citizens who won because there were not enough of\nthe pursuit machines to beat the Rightmen; all they could do was to\ncreate confusion in the Rightmen ranks, and work demoralization by\ncarrying off fighters.\"\n\nStevens was silent for a moment, then: \"What happened to the\nRightmen--those who weren't killed?\"\n\n\"They were Regulated, Alfreed among them, and all came out sane again.\"\n\n\"And Isral--the Hebers?\"\n\n\"Doing fine; they're going into arts and crafts, something which the\nChief Historian says has been a lost function with us. We needed them\nbadly.\"\n\nHe scratched his head. \"Somehow,\" he said, \"I feel different. I'm not\nthe old, frightened Clark Stevens that I once was; and I'm not the man\nI was when I first ran away with you.\n\n\"I want to live here, in the city. Yet I'm still not satisfied with it.\nIt has to be changed.\"\n\nHe broke off as the Neuro-specialist came in. \"Hello,\" he said, \"what's\nup?\"\n\n\"'Lo, Stevens,\" replied the man. \"Feeling all right?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"We want you on the council. There was a faction that wanted to\nregulate you again, but most of us agree that we need men of your kind\nhere, so long as they're not extremists. You seem to have levelled off\nto just the right point to make you valuable.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Strange, Clement, but I feel the same about you fellows. At\none time, I thought you were all fit for scrapping, but now I see that\nthe city needs you as much as it does me. I think that's the answer: we\nneed all kinds of people; no one kind can be permitted to dominate, but\nno one kind can be suppressed, either.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Markett. \"After that one big burst of violent battle,\nyou worked the ego of Roald the Viking almost completely out of your\npsychology. Only the part that I like, that I love, is left--and I\nthink that will stay put.\"\n\nStevens reached out and took her hand.\n\n\"I--I'd like to wear cloth again instead of leather, Clark.\" Markett\nsaid--and both men laughed.",
