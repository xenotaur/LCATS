    "body": "They are boys; we found it out long ago. It was their coming in that\nsmall, immature shape that puzzled us; we were not used to it. There\nare some girls now. Abel is a good boy, but if Cain had stayed a bear\nit would have improved him. After all these years, I see that I was\nmistaken about Eve in the beginning; it is better to live outside the\nGarden with her than inside it without her. At first I thought she\ntalked too much; but now I should be sorry to have that voice fall\nsilent and pass out of my life. Blessed be the chestnut that brought us\nnear together and taught me to know the goodness of her heart and the\nsweetness of her spirit!",
