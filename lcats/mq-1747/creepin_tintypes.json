    "body": "by W. C. Tuttle\n\nAuthor of \u201cTippecanoe and Cougars Two,\u201d \u201cBetween Pike\u2019s Peak and a\nPickle,\u201d etc.\n\n\nThere ain\u2019t no question but what me and \u201cDirty Shirt\u201d Jones would like\nto go back to Piperock. Sort of a call of the wild, I reckon, and at\nthat there ain\u2019t many places wilder than Piperock.\n\nMe and Dirty started in to help \u201cScenery\u201d Sims, the sheriff, put\n\u201cTombstone\u201d Todd in jail. It was dark and Scenery didn\u2019t have no\nhandcuffs, so me and Dirty helped him handle his prisoner. Me and Dirty\nhave peered upon the wine when it was red and neither of us cared much\nfor Scenery with his squeaky little voice; so when Piperock awoke the\nnext morning they had to dynamite the jail to get their sheriff out of\nhis own cell. No, I don\u2019t know where Tombstone went.\n\nThereupon Piperock riseth in a body and follers me and Dirty plumb to\nthe border. Maybe they wanted to congratulate us, but we\u2019re very, very\nmodest. Me and Dirty ain\u2019t bad. We was just joking with Scenery.\n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t think Tombstone was guilty of rustling Seven A cows. He\nsaid he wasn\u2019t, and there wasn\u2019t no reason for him lying about it to me\nand Dirty, unless he was afraid we\u2019d want part of the proceeds. This is\nwhy we\u2019re in a strange county, at a strange bar and talking with a\nstranger. He\u2019s a pe-culiar-looking _hombre_, sort of sad-eyed, as he\npeers through his glass of hard liquor.\n\n\u201cThe West,\u201d says he, \u201cis the bunk. There ain\u2019t none such.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat for kind of a West does you require?\u201d asks Dirty, like he was\ntrying to sell the feller a necktie.\n\n\u201cWild,\u201d says he. \u201cWild like the writers tell us about. The kind of a\nWest that Buffalo Bill knew. I\u2019ve hunted for it loud and long, but she\nain\u2019t and that\u2019s an end to it. Have another drink?\u201d\n\n\u201cMister,\u201d says Dirty, \u201cyou came West but you never got there. Somehow\nyou missed Piperock.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhither lieth said Piperock?\u201d\n\n\u201cLieth is a good word,\u201d nods Dirty. \u201cIn direction, she\u2019s south of here\nand as the crow flies she\u2019s a hundred miles.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that real West?\u201d\n\n\u201cMan, that\u2019s the West. All others is imitations and frauds.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou brings me great cheer,\u201d says he. \u201cBartender, do your duty.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou bring cheer to two of us, the same of which makes three cheers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldst have you take me to this Piperock place.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d says Dirty. \u201cMe and Ike Harper are not taking anybody within\nsheriff-shot of Piperock, although our hearts are homesick for the old\nvillage of vice. We wouldst go there, pardner, but circumstances are\nagainst us. We\u2019ll tell yuh some few things pertaining to that hamlet of\nhorror, but that\u2019s as far as we\u2019ll go.\n\n\u201cThe city limits of Piperock are the distance a sheriff can ride in two\nhours and then shoot with a .30-30; the same of which marks a spot\nseveral miles removed from the turmoil of town. Me and Ike are outside\nthat distance and we stays out, eh, Ike?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t \u2019a\u2019 said more if yuh hired a hall,\u201d says I. \u201cWhy does yuh\nwish to see the West in its raw state, mister?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a realist,\u201d says he, dreamy-like. \u201cI hate the artificial.\u201d\n\n\u201cGawd bless and keep yuh,\u201d says Dirty. \u201cYou\u2019ll find it there, but yuh\nmay never return back. The sheriff sells cemetery space.\u201d\n\nHe absorbs his liquor and seems a heap interested.\n\n\u201cIs there a bank there that might be robbed and does they have a stage\nthat might have a reason for carrying bullion?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d says Dirty, \u201cme and Ike appears shocked at your question, but at\nthe same time we\u2019re a heap interested. Let\u2019s go outside where there\nain\u2019t no walls to have ears and speak of such things as banks and\nstages. Yuh never can tell who might overhear us and suspect us of\nphilanthropy.\u201d\n\nWe goes across the street and sets down on the sidewalk.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d says Dirty, \u201cthere is a bank and there is a stage. Me and Ike are\nbroke, but up to the present our records are as clean as our six-guns.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you know how to rob a bank or a stage?\u201d he asks. \u201cDo the job like\nit ought to be done?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe ain\u2019t got no references from bank nor stage-lines,\u201d says I.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d says Dirty, \u201cwe\u2019re honest. We\u2019ll split three ways, mister.\u201d\n\nHe thinks it over for a while, and then says\u2014\n\n\u201cWell, I feel that I\u2019ve struck what I\u2019ve been looking for.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what \u2018Mighty\u2019 Jones said when he fell off into Hellgate Ca\u00f1on\nand dislodged a hunk of galena ore, fifty feet from the bottom,\u201d says\nDirty.\n\n\u201cA feller never knows his luck till the wheel stops.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou two are going with me,\u201d says he.\n\n\u201cUs two ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to do no such a thing,\u201d says I. \u201cYou don\u2019t know\nPiperock like we do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re going with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a danged poor fortune-teller,\u201d observes Dirty. \u201cMe and Ike would\nlast about as long as a snowball in Yuma and you\u2019d be alone. They\u2019d put\nus in a nice little jail and then you\u2019d get lost, strayed or stolen.\n\n\u201cNo, sir. You write to all your folks, predictin\u2019 your demise, leave\nyour watch and chain with the bartender, and then walk into town,\nunarmed and with your hands in the air.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy golly, that\u2019s the town I\u2019ve been looking for,\u201d says he. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cMister, she\u2019s a great place for freaks,\u201d says Dirty. \u201cYou won\u2019t be in\nthat place long until you\u2019ll join P. T. Barnum.\u201d\n\n\u201cBarnum?\u201d says he. \u201cBarnum is dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure\u2014I know it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d says he, after a while. \u201cYou\u2019re going with me. I\u2019ll disguise you\nso nobody will know you, you understand? I must have you with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMister,\u201d says I, \u201care you just a \u2014\u2014 tenderfoot who wants to be a bad\nman, or what\u2019s all your talk about banks and bullion?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a realist, as I said before. The West has never been depicted as I\nfeel it really is and I am going to show them something new. I have a\nstory, \u2018The Twilight Trail,\u2019 which has been partly done, but I want\nrealism. I want the spirit of the old West in it. I want a stage\nhold-up, a bank robbery, with real people in it, in a Western town\u2014real\nWest. Now, do you understand?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust like I do Chinese,\u201d says I. \u201cYou said a lot, but she don\u2019t somehow\nfit into my mind. You don\u2019t want much, I _sabe_ that part of it, don\u2019t\nyou, Dirty?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s plumb modest and meek, Ike. Are you a writer?\u201d\n\n\u201cMoving-pictures, gents. I am Llewellyn Waldemar.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds like a breed of bird-dogs,\u201d says Dirty, \u201cbut his ears are too\nsmall.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to insult me,\u201d he snaps.\n\n\u201cNow, wait,\u201d begs Dirty. \u201cDid you ever see a Llewellyn dog?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I never did.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then don\u2019t get insulted. They\u2019re a \u2014\u2014 nice-lookin\u2019 animile. You\nsay you\u2019re a movin\u2019-pitcher?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I take \u2019em.\u201d\n\n\u201cHm-m-m-m,\u201d says Dirty. \u201cI never seen any, but I\u2019ve heard tell about\n\u2019em. Does them pitchers make yuh think they\u2019re movin\u2019?\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe feller looks at Dirty, like he was a new species of animal, and then\nwipes his eyes. He wipes his eyes several times and acts like he had a\nfish-bone in his throat, but he gets all right after while and says:\n\n\u201cCome on. I\u2019m going to find a disguise for you to wear.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a wonder if you can conceal me,\u201d says Dirty, who is cock-eyed in\none optic. \u201cAll them snake-hunters has to do is take one look at me and\nI\u2019m due to chase buffalo in the happy hunting-ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmoked glasses will fix you,\u201d says he.\n\n\u201cSmoked glasses won\u2019t help my bowlegs,\u201d says I. \u201cMagpie says he can roll\nme like a hoop.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d live to see the day when I\u2019d have to look at\nPiperock through smoked glasses,\u201d wails Dirty.\n\nWell, he fixed us up; that\u2019s a cinch. When he got through with us we\nlooked like a couple of shepherds gone to seed. Down at one of them\ntwo-handed stores he purchased us both a outfit. He got us each a pair\nof smoked specs and some whiskers which makes us resemble a pair of\nowls.\n\n\u201cYour home town won\u2019t recognize you now,\u201d says he.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Dirty, \u201cbut that won\u2019t profit us much. Piperock may not\npenetrate our disguise, but that won\u2019t stop \u2019em from pot-shooting a pair\nof freaks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one cinch,\u201d says I. \u201cThey won\u2019t never kill us in our own\nnames.\u201d\n\nHe takes us up to a hotel where all his stuff is and we sets down on the\nbed while he packs up.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a sheriff have they got in Piperock?\u201d he asks.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a wonder,\u201d says Dirty, \u201cand very fast with a gun.\u201d\n\nThen me and Dirty thinks about Scenery Sims. He\u2019s about five feet two\ninches tall and his face is so danged thin that his mustache looks like\na buffalo-robe hanging on a hatchet. I could rummage around in a sack\nand get a gun faster than Scenery could pull one out of his holster.\n\nWaldemar got us a pair of valises to pack our own clothes in and then we\ndrinks to our disguises and pilgrims to the depot.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d says Dirty, as we climb on the train, \u201cI know \u2014\u2014 well that\nwe\u2019re pilin\u2019 up for grief for our side. We ain\u2019t got no sense, Ike.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll never know you,\u201d says Waldemar.\n\n\u201cAfter we\u2019re dead they will,\u201d wails Dirty, \u201cand I ain\u2019t never deceived\nanybody yet. I can just hear \u2018Old Testament\u2019 Tilton sayin\u2019, \u2018Man is of\nfew days and full of trouble, O, my brethren, and these two grabbed off\nmore than they could chew,\u2019 and then the Cross J quartet will sing,\n\u2018Jee-e-e-roo-o-o-sa-lem, Jee-e-e-roo-o-o-sa-lem, lee-e-ft up your voice\nan\u2019 see-e-ng.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Holy City,\u201d says Waldemar. \u201cA beautiful thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s only skin-deep with that bunch,\u201d sighs Dirty. \u201cI hope they just\nbury me and dispense with the sermon and songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t hear none of it,\u201d says I. \u201cWe\u2019ll be layin\u2019 there with our\nsmoked glasses on and a cactus flower on our breast.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m goin\u2019 to like Piperock,\u201d says Waldemar.\n\n\u201cYour taste is all in your mouth, then,\u201d says Dirty. \u201cWhat are we\nsupposed to be, in case anybody asks us?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou two?\u201d\n\nHe thinks for quite a while, and then says:\n\n\u201cTell you what\u2014you two are scientists, looking for the remains of a\u2014a\ndinosaur. Mister Jones will be Professor Doolittle and Mister Harper\nwill be Professor Smythe. How\u2019s that for names?\u201d\n\n\u201cLookin\u2019 for a dinny-sor,\u201d nods Dirty. \u201cMight as well die for that as\nanything else, I reckon. Do we have to describe said\u2014uh\u2014thing? Is it a\npredatory animile, bird of prey or a crippled crawler?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dinosaur,\u201d says he, \u201cdied a million years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome fortune-teller likely told him what Piperock was goin\u2019 to be\nlike,\u201d says Dirty.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe got off the train at Paradise, just in time to catch Art Miller\u2019s\nstage to Piperock, and on that stage is \u201cMagpie\u201d Simpkins and Judge\nSteele. Magpie looks us over, careful-like and then shakes his head.\n\n\u201cThere ain\u2019t none,\u201d says he.\n\n\u201cNone what?\u201d asks Dirty.\n\n\u201cE-clipse of the sun.\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Smythe and Professor Doolittle have ruined their eyes working\non scientific data,\u201d explains Waldemar.\n\n\u201cWhy confine your post mortem to eyes?\u201d asks Magpie. \u201c\u2019Pears to me that\nthey\u2019ve ruined the rest of \u2019em, too. I suppose that one\u2014\u201d pointing at\nme\u2014\u201cgot warped in the legs from studyin\u2019 the shape of the earth. Can\u2019t\nthey talk United States?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were born in this country,\u201d says Waldemar.\n\n\u201cWhat part?\u201d asks the judge.\n\n\u201cAll of us, you \u2014\u2014 fool!\u201d I snaps.\n\n\u201cThink we were assembled?\u201d\n\n\u201cGoin\u2019 to Piperock?\u201d asks Magpie.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Waldemar. \u201cYes, we are bound for there.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn a mission?\u201d asks the judge.\n\n\u201cMostly for a rest,\u201d says Waldemar.\n\n\u201cYou likely will be,\u201d admits Magpie, \u201cand there\u2019s plenty of room in the\njail.\u201d\n\nWe goes to Sam Holt\u2019s hotel. Old Sam sizes us up kinda close-like, and\nthen Waldemar says\u2014\n\n\u201cHave you three rooms?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have,\u201d says old Sam, \u201cand two of \u2019em I\u2019ll keep.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asks Waldemar.\n\n\u201cThem two,\u201d pointing at me and Dirty, \u201ccan\u2019t get no room from me. The\nlast shepherd what stayed in my hotel left a lot of his mee-nag-i-ree\nbehind.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour danged old hotel didn\u2019t need \u2019em,\u201d says Dirty. \u201cYou ain\u2019t changed\nblankets since the battle of Little Big Horn.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you know about me?\u201d he asks. \u201cWho in \u2014\u2014 are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Professor Doolittle,\u201d says Dirty, \u201cand I\u2019m lookin\u2019 for a\ndinny-sor.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look like you\u2019d do much and I ain\u2019t got none today,\u201d says\nSam, meanlike. \u201cYou \u2014\u2014 shepherds are always loco about something.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we sleep in the barn?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cNo, yuh can\u2019t! My horses are all pets.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there any other hotel?\u201d asks Waldemar.\n\n\u201cI can give yuh a place to sleep,\u201d squeaks a voice behind us, and we\nturns to see Scenery Sims.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d says Waldemar, \u201canother landlord looking for business.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t no landlord\u2014I\u2019m the sheriff,\u201d squeaks Scenery. \u201cI\u2019ve got a\nempty jail if yuh wants a place to sleep.\u201d\n\nMe and Dirty are sort of thinking it over when Magpie Simpkins shows up.\nHe asks what the trouble is, and Sam Holt tells him.\n\n\u201cScientists is always welcome to my shack,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cI\u2019ve got\nroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t wish to deprive yuh,\u201d says Dirty.\n\n\u201cThere ain\u2019t no depravity about it,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cI hankers to talk\nwith learned men, being as this is such a ignorant neighborhood, and\nyou\u2019re just as welcome as the flowers in January. What seek ye here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m lookin\u2019 for a dinny-sor,\u201d says Dirty.\n\n\u201cNever heard of him,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cThere used to be a Dinny McCall\nworkin\u2019 for the Five Dot outfit, down near Sulphur Flat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has been dead a million years,\u201d explains Dirty.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d says Magpie, fussing with his mustache. \u201cOh, yeah. That was before\nI came here. What killed him?\u201d\n\n\u201cWear and tear, I reckon,\u201d says Dirty.\n\nHe takes me and Dirty down to his cabin, and makes us to home.\n\n\u201cI had a pardner once,\u201d says Magpie, \u201cbut the \u2014\u2014 fool went loco, and\nsome law-abidin\u2019 citizens chased him across the border.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he done wrong?\u201d asks Dirty.\n\n\u201cIf he ever done right he came back and corrected himself. Him and\nanother cross between a bed-bug and a bee-sting went away together, and\nPiperock profiteth thereby. Make yourselves to home. You gents comes\nhere at a opportune time, you know it? Tomorrow is the tenth anniversary\nof Piperock and we\u2019re goin\u2019 to celebrate.\u201d\n\n\u201cCelebrate?\u201d whispers Dirty, hoarse-like. \u201cCelebrate what? Is the town\nmarried?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnniversary,\u201d explains Magpie, \u201cmeans a year. Piperock is ten years old\nand she\u2019s goin\u2019 to celebrate her growth and civilization. This is her\nbirthday.\n\n\u201cThey will come from near and far, gents, and great will be the day and\ndate. There will be bronco-bustin\u2019, et cettery, and bull-doggin\u2019 of\nsteers. There will be ropin\u2019 contests, et cettery and some shootin\u2019.\nShe\u2019ll be worth your patience.\u201d\n\nMagpie goes out and me and Dirty sets there and looks at each other.\n\n\u201cMy \u2014\u2014!\u201d gasps Dirty. \u201cI feel that everything is not well with my soul.\nSomebody is goin\u2019 to see Dirty Shirt Jones behind these whiskers and\nspecs and I\u2019ll be forced to stand on nothin\u2019 and look up a rope.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe of good cheer,\u201d says I, \u201cfor I will be with thee. They\u2019ll have\nsomething except Piperock\u2019s birthday to celebrate next year.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo scientists drink hard liquor, Ike?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey has a throat and a tongue,\u201d says I. And then we pilgrims uptown,\nand goes into Buck Masterson\u2019s saloon, where we gets fortified against\nour fears of the near future. Waldemar is there, and Waldemar has\nsurrounded himself with enough hooch to make him expand considerable.\nWhen we gets there he\u2019s talkin\u2019 politics with \u201cHalf Mile\u201d Smith, and\n\u201cSwan River,\u201d and neither of them snake-hunters knows anything about\npolitics, except who is sheriff.\n\nHe introduces us to them two misfits, and they gets agreeable.\n\n\u201cMister Smythe,\u201d says Swan River, looking me over, \u201cyour legs are twins\nto the legs of a \u2014\u2014 fool I know, but from the waist up you look like a\nbum thrower. I\u2019m pleased to meetcha.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe sure is built so he don\u2019t have to go around nothin\u2019,\u201d agrees Half\nMile.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very brilliant man,\u201d says Waldemar. \u201cThey both have degrees.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey look about zero to me,\u201d says Buck Masterson.\n\n\u201cThey know things which are concealed from ordinary men,\u201d says Waldemar.\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d says Half Mile. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be surprized. Any horse-thief is\nin the same fix\u2014if he\u2019s got any sense.\u201d\n\nA little later on we corrals Waldemar and asks him what he thinks of the\ntown.\n\n\u201cYou sure led me to the right place,\u201d says he. \u201cI have dreamed of this\nkind of a place.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ought to stick to dreams,\u201d advises Dirty. \u201cWe\u2019re wishin\u2019 you\u2019d\nhurry up and finish your business here, \u2019cause me and Ike hankers for\nthe open places. _Sabe?_ This city air stifles our lungs and makes our\nnecks ache.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m framing it all up in my mind,\u201d says he, \u201cand in the morning we\u2019ll\nset up the camera in the hotel window which will give me a full shot at\nthe street, with the bank in the foreground, and then\u2014can you two get\nhorses?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d says Dirty. \u201cWe have got \u2019em\u2014at times.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe a little risky for you two,\u201d says he. \u201cI\u2019ll have two of \u2019em at\nthe hitch-rack across the street. I won\u2019t have you ride into town,\nbecause some one might spot you. I can fake the entrance. You fellows\nwill dress in your range clothes, you understand? At the right time you\nwill come around the corner of the saloon, swing on to your horses, dash\nacross the street, where one of you will go inside, rob the bank and\ncome out, get your horses and dash out of town. I hope the sheriff will\nget quick action with the posse.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy \u2014\u2014!\u201d gasps Dirty. \u201cYou\u2019re all through with us, are yuh? You can\u2019t\nuse us any further, mister? What has we done to you that you should wish\nour demise?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t taking many chances,\u201d says he. \u201cYou\u2019ll take \u2019em so by\nsurprize that they\u2019ll forget everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcept to shoot,\u201d says I. \u201cPiperock never forgets their guns. No, sir,\nyou\u2019ve got to figure out something easier than that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a chance of a life-time,\u201d says he, sad-like, and then he gets this\nidea\u2014\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you a hundred dollars apiece.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen?\u201d asks Dirty.\n\n\u201cAfter the robbery.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe a sport and make it a million apiece,\u201d says Dirty. \u201cWe\u2019ll never live\nto collect and a man don\u2019t mind dying for a big stake.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can keep what you get from the bank.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to take no money,\u201d says I. \u201cWe\u2019re just goin\u2019 in and come\nright out again. _Sabe?_ Folks will think it\u2019s a robbery.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want this done right,\u201d says he. \u201cI want the real thing. Take it and\nthen bring it back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says Dirty, \u201cif you feel thataway\u2014how about yuh, Ike?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes me no never mind, Dirty. When they finds my remains with my\ndear hands folded around stolen money it won\u2019t hurt my reputation none.\nI\u2019m willing to do danged near anything, so as we get away where I can\ntake off this beard. My own whiskers are growing circles inside \u2019em.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs the hundred satisfactory?\u201d asks Waldemar.\n\n\u201cIn advance,\u201d nods Dirty. \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 to enjoy myself before the old\nfeller with the hay-hook comes along and cuts me off at the pockets.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nWaldemar starts to argue, but we both stands pat and he gives us the\nmoney. A hundred dollars is a lot of money to a man who expects to die\nthe next day. There ain\u2019t no rainy days in his future. He don\u2019t care a\nwhoop what comes to pass. Some folks might prepare themselves by\npraying, but me and Dirty never have asked for anything we ain\u2019t got the\nnerve to go and get for ourselves. We just throws dull care out of the\nwindow and gets cheerful.\n\nInto our rosy existence cometh \u201cBig Foot\u201d Benson and \u201cHoodoo\u201d Harris.\nThem two pelicans proclaims it open season on anything that comes in\nbottles.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a danged queer-looking pair,\u201d says Big Foot, \u201cbut it takes all\nkinds of folks to herd sheep. Klahowya.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour whiskers ain\u2019t orthodox,\u201d says Hoodoo, peering at Dirty, \u201cor has\nyou reverted to the reptiles and sheds your skin in the hot days?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re scientists,\u201d says Dirty, \u201cand we\u2019re lookin\u2019 for a dinny-sor.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d says Hoodoo. \u201cWell, you come to the right place, gents. The\nLord knows you can find anything here, except a square deal. Why does\nyou cover your eyes with gloomy glasses thataway? Does you hanker for\nthe dark side of life?\u201d\n\n\u201cYuh never could find a dinny-sor with the naked eye,\u201d says I, and they\naccepts the verdict.\n\nThat was one wild night for science. I reckon every puncher within fifty\nmiles showed up for the celebration, being as there\u2019s prizes offered,\nand me and Dirty, after absorbing considerable cheer, has a hard time\nsticking to plain science.\n\nDirty had a fight with Mighty Jones, when the two of \u2019em gets to\ndiscussing whether man came from monkey or not. Mighty debates that they\nare, and offers Dirty as a living proof. Two sheep-herders from over on\nMedicine Creek, cries on my neck and calls me \u201cbrother,\u201d and I licked\n\u2019em both.\n\nYes, it sure was a regular evening and my throat was raw from trying to\nchange my natural voice and talk like a scientist ought to talk. Dirty\nShirt\u2019s whiskers tried to crawl under his chin several times, but the\ncrowd was too joyful to pay any attention to whiskers.\n\nSomehow I can\u2019t just remember what happened after midnight, except that\nWaldemar corrals me and tells me to pull off the stunt at ten o\u2019clock.\nHe explains the details, but I only hears half of it, \u2019cause Hoodoo is\ntrying to tell me something about a mosquito that bit him when he was at\nthe North Pole.\n\nDirty and Big Foot are trying to sing something about a wild Irish rose\nand Buck Masterson is standing on the bar, trying to nominate a Populist\nfor president. We all voted for Buck\u2019s candidate, I remember that much,\nand then me and Dirty starts home, amid much applause.\n\nAcross the street the Cross J quartet is singing\u2014\n\n\u201cJee-e-e-roo-o-o-sa-a-a-lem, Jee-e-e-roo-o-o-sa-a-a-lem, lee-e-e-ft up\nyour voice and see-e-e-ng.\u201d\n\nAnd Judge Steele is orating about\u2014\n\n\u201c\u2014and in the glorious land of our forefathers, where the\u2014the\u2014sun never\nsets and the\u2014the\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIke,\u201d says Dirty, \u201ca man is of few days and full of trouble, but right\nnow I\u2019m a mockin\u2019-bird, with spreadin\u2019 pinions and a dazzlin\u2019 top-knot.\nI may die tomorrow, but right now I\u2019m a feathered songster, light of\nheart and sound of limb. O death, where is thy stinger?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe devil has it on the grindstone, Dirty,\u201d says I, \u201cand by ten o\u2019clock\ntomorrow she\u2019ll be sharper than a serpent\u2019s tooth.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next morning we sure slept peacefully, while Magpie goes uptown.\nHe\u2019s one of the leading lights, as usual. I reckon it\u2019s about nine\no\u2019clock when me and Dirty gets something to eat. Dirty is a danged long\nways from being a mocking-bird. We can\u2019t eat. Maybe it\u2019s from looking\ntoo much into the future, but I think it\u2019s from looking too much into\nthe bottom of a glass.\n\n\u201cIf they sees us before we gets them broncs, Waldemar\u2019s moving-pitcher\nis going to be a failure,\u201d says I, as we puts on our own clothes, after\nsoaking them beards loose.\n\n\u201cWaldemar?\u201d says Dirty. \u201cMy gosh, Ike, you are getting temperamental,\nlike a regular primmydonner. His pitcher a failure? What\u2019s his danged\npitcher beside my breath of life? If them or\u2019nary saddle-slickers see us\nbefore we reach them broncs\u2014Waldemar gets a regular necktie pitcher.\nThey\u2019ll hang us to that tree right near Sam Holt\u2019s porch, Ike.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s too bad, Dirty. Where\u2019ll we go if we get away with it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere yuh are!\u201d wails Dirty, flopping his arms. \u201cNo place to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ve got to go, anyway; so it might as well be now.\u201d\n\nWe went out of there and sneaked up on the town of Piperock, like it was\na wild thing. Maybe that statement ain\u2019t far wrong. We crawls in behind\nBuck\u2019s place, and gets behind a pile of cord-wood. Me and Dirty has both\ngot watches. Mine says ten minutes to ten, and Dirty\u2019s says fifteen\nminutes after ten.\n\n\u201cMine\u2019s right,\u201d says Dirty, positive-like. \u201cThat watch ain\u2019t lost a\nsecond in two years. I can correct the sun with that watch, yuh betcha.\nWe\u2019re late!\u201d\n\n\u201cYuh can\u2019t beat a Swiss movement,\u201d says I, \u201cand that\u2019s the kind mine is.\nIt is now ten minutes of ten.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re crazy, Ike. Lemme tell yuh something about this\u2014huh\u2014listen to\nyour watch and see if she\u2019s runnin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t,\u201d says I, after listening. \u201cI forgot to wind it last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe, too,\u201d says Dirty. \u201cMy \u2014\u2014, we\u2019re in an awful fix.\u201d\n\nComes a few yells and a few shots out on the street and then the clatter\nof six-shooter explosions.\n\n\u201cThe celebration is on,\u201d says I. \u201cIt was due to start at ten o\u2019clock.\nLet\u2019s take a chance. I hope to gosh them broncs are there for us.\u201d I\ntakes my life in one hand, a six-shooter in the other and leads the way.\nThere\u2019s more than two broncs at the rack, but there ain\u2019t no time to\nfigure out ownership, et cettery. There\u2019s considerable humanity in\nsight.\n\n\u201cTake that gray one, Dirty,\u201d says I, and then I happens to think that we\nain\u2019t figured out who is to go inside the bank.\n\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d says I. \u201cDo you go inside or do I, Dirty?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes no difference who goes in, Ike. We\u2019ll be deader than \u2014\u2014 in\nabout three minutes anyway. You go in, will yuh?\u201d\n\n\u201cA-a-a-board!\u201d says I, and hops on to that mouse-colored bronc, which\nlooks like it might go as far and fast.\n\nSomehow I don\u2019t no more than hook the right stirrup before I realizes\nthat I\u2019ve made a mistake. I hears Dirty sort of hiccup a curse, and I\u2019m\nbetting that he has the same thoughts. I don\u2019t know about that\nmouse-colored bronc going fast and far, but I sure know it went high.\nAlso, I soon realized that my saddle wasn\u2019t cinched tight. Every time we\nwent high and handsome I can feel the slack in that cinch and it makes\nme nervous.\n\n\u201cGit to \u2014\u2014 out of the way!\u201d I hears Dirty yelp, and into me comes that\ngray bronc, sunfishin\u2019 like forked lightning and whistling like a scared\nbuck. It\u2019s about sixty feet across that street to the front of the bank.\nKnow how long it took us to get there? I ain\u2019t there yet, if you\u2019re\ncurious to know, and this happened a long time ago.\n\nBut Dirty got there. Yessir, he got there. At the edge of the sidewalk\nhis cinch busted and he went right in through one of the front windows.\nHe went in feet first, into the window with the sign painted on it, and\nhe stopped with one leg through the cashier\u2019s window and the other leg\nwaving for help.\n\nMy bronc stopped bucking long enough for me to see all that and then we\nturns right around\u2014me and that high-minded piece of deviltry\u2014and we\nbucked straight for Buck Masterson\u2019s saloon. There\u2019s a big crowd there,\nand they sure give us room. Some danged fool must \u2019a\u2019 tried to kill that\nbronc, but missed and one bullet burned my ear, and the other peeled my\nknuckles on my left hand. Yes, we went in. By that time the cinch is\nback in the bronc\u2019s flanks, and I\u2019m riding wild and free on its rump,\nwith the saddle going further back all the time.\n\nI didn\u2019t dare to fall off, so I done my dangdest. I got a view of scared\nfaces as we made a mulligan of a perfectly healthy poker game and then I\nwent up and jammed my head through the bale of a hanging-lamp, and took\nit with us, hanging around my neck.\n\nThe back door was partly open and we took it away, hinges and all, and\nthen we\u2019re out in the open again, with Piperock, et cettery, howling in\nour rear. I banged the bronc with my hat and swung him back toward the\nstreet, where I runs into Dirty, backing across the street, shooting\nevery direction. I skids that bronc to a standstill, and yells\u2014\n\n\u201cGet up behind me!\u201d\n\nDirty stubs his heel and falls down and danged near shot me. Then he\ngets to his feet and runs up to me.\n\n\u201cGet on behind you?\u201d he yells. \u201cHow in \u2014\u2014 can I? You\u2019re as far back as\nyou can get! I\u2019ll get on in front.\u201d\n\nDirty got on. The first jump that bronc made landed him up on its neck,\nwhere he locks his legs around under its jaws and away we went, me way\nback on its rump and him almost on its head, while Piperock fired\nsalutes and cheered in a loud voice.\n\nWe turned a corner and bucked around and around until we slammed up\nagainst the jail, where my cinch slid down around the bronc\u2019s hind legs\nand I got kicked in the belly with both hind feet. Then the bronc\nwhirled sideways, and slammed Dirty against the corner of the building.\nHe just lets loose and drops like a suit of clothes, while the bronc\nwhistles again and hits for the open country.\n\nI ain\u2019t got no ambition left, but I\u2019ve got sense enough to throw the\nsaddle and Dirty Shirt Jones inside the jail, and then fall in after\nhim. I kicked the door shut, but Piperock cometh not. There ain\u2019t no\nsign of pursuit. Pretty soon Dirty\u2019s lips open and he begins singing:\n\n\u201c\u2014le-e-e-ft up your voice and see-e-e-e-ng. Ho-o-o-o-o-sa-a-na-a\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up!\u201d I croaks. \u201cYou ain\u2019t dead\u2014yet.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe sets up and licks his lips while he feels of his head.\n\n\u201cWhat did yuh say?\u201d he asks, weak-like.\n\n\u201cI said, you ain\u2019t dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cFeller, there\u2019s a lot of things that you don\u2019t know. Where are we?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the jail.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank the Lord! This is better than I expected. What are we charged\nwith?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much did yuh get in the bank?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t anybody there,\u201d he wails. \u201cI left one boot. It hung in the\ncashier\u2019s window and I didn\u2019t have time to get it loose. How did we get\nhere?\u201d\n\nI told him all I knew about it, and he marvels exceedingly.\n\n\u201cWe obtained money under false pretenses, Ike,\u201d says he. \u201cWe agreed to\nrob a bank and there wasn\u2019t nobody to hold up.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe agreed to plant a couple of horses for us,\u201d says I, \u201cand he either\nhas a danged poor idea of what a feller rides to a bank robbery or we\npicked the wrong steeds.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrognostications don\u2019t alleviate the crack in my head,\u201d says Dirty.\n\u201c\u2019Pears to me that my brain is runnin\u2019 out.\u201d\n\n\u201cCast aside all fear,\u201d says I. \u201cYou never could hit that hard. I\u2019ve got\na splintered wish-bone and my stummick has been turned wrong side out.\nWhat will we do next, Dirty?\u201d\n\n\u201cGet away from here,\u201d says Dirty, which shows that his brains ain\u2019t\nleaking to no great extent.\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d I asks. \u201cLooks to me like this quiet little jail is about the\nonly safe place for me and you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, why in \u2014\u2014 don\u2019t somebody come along and chide us?\u201d complains\nDirty, nervous-like. \u201cIt ain\u2019t like Piperock to do things like this,\nIke. Why don\u2019t they kill us and have it over with?\u201d\n\n\u201cWant to die, feller?\u201d I asks. \u201cPinin\u2019 away for death, are yuh?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I ain\u2019t, Ike, but if I\u2019ve got to die\u2014hurrah for \u2014\u2014! Who\u2019s afraid of\nfire?\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we sneak back to the shack and get our disguises, Dirty?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot me! If I\u2019m goin\u2019 to die, good. I\u2019ll die as Dirty Shirt Jones, not\nas a buzzard-headed bug-hunter who is lookin\u2019 for somethin\u2019 that crawled\naway and died a million years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what yuh goin\u2019 to do, Dirty? Figure a little, can\u2019t yuh?\u201d\n\n\u201cFiggers be \u2014\u2014! I\u2019m to camp right here until dark, or until some figger\nof vengeance cometh along and herds me hence. _Sabe?_ Give yourself up,\ngo out and get shot, choke yourself to death with your own fair hands\u2014do\nwhat you think best, Ike, but old man Jones\u2019 little fair-haired child is\ngoin\u2019 inside a nice cool cell and sleep off a headache.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do nothin\u2019 but foller yuh,\u201d says I, sad-like.\n\n\u201cYour attachment for me is sweet,\u201d says he. \u201cI\u2019m all choked up with\ne-motion, and if I didn\u2019t feel so bad I would cry.\u201d\n\nSometimes I wonder who left that quart of hooch under that bunk. We\nmoved the bunk over, so nobody could see us from the sheriff\u2019s office,\nand there she stood, brave and bold. Me and Dirty surrounds it, inhales\nthe odors of Araby, originated in Kentucky and fixed with equal parts of\nalkali water, copperas, chewing-tobacco and coal-oil, for the\nconsumption of Piperock\u2019s leading citizens.\n\nThen we humps up on the bunk and wishes each other a great deal of\npleasure in the future. I reckon we done a lot of wishin\u2019. I dreamed of\na whole danged string of wishes hanging on a line like laundry out to\ndry, and when I woke it was dark. Dirty Shirt sounds like a dry saw\ngoing through a greasewood butt. I\u2019m about to wake him up, when I hears\nvoices. I jabs my heel into Dirty\u2019s shins, and he sets up like one of\nthem mechanical toys.\n\n\u201cYeah, and I hope yuh gets ninety-nine years and the balance of your\nlife,\u201d we hears Scenery Sims saying in his rusty voice. \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 to\nput yuh in and then I\u2019m goin\u2019 up-town and tell all about it. Some of\nthem snake-hunters think I\u2019m no good as a sheriff, but I gets my man.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome old lady must \u2019a\u2019 got drunk and fell down and busted her leg,\u201d\nsays Dirty in a hoarse whisper. \u201cHear that woodchuck peep?\u201d\n\nThe door of the cell is yanked open, and two men comes inside. Me and\nDirty ain\u2019t ready for to be locked in, so as they comes in we goes out.\nScenery stands there in the dark, sort of stiff-like. Dirty Shirt lights\na match and holds it up. I hears Scenery give a gasp and then the match\nwent out. Then his gun falls on the floor.\n\nI feels two men slip past us in the dark, but I don\u2019t reckon that\nScenery heard \u2019em. He moved over the table, knocked the lamp-chimney on\nthe floor, and then managed to light the rest of the lamp. He squints at\nus, and then goes over to the cell, where he peers inside. Then he sets\ndown in a chair and stares at us. We don\u2019t say a word, but we\u2019re dang\nnear bustin\u2019 inside. Pretty soon Scenery gets up, like a feller walking\nin his sleep, and goes inside and pulls the door shut after himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know,\u201d he squeaks in a whisper, staring at us through the\nbars. \u201cI ain\u2019t felt good for a week\u2014dang it! Seein\u2019 spots in front on my\neyes. It sure is \u2014\u2014 to see things thisaway. Must be my stummick.\u201d\n\nDirty stepped over, blowed out the light and we went outside.\n\n\u201cWhere to?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cAny civilized port,\u201d says Dirty.\n\n\u201cSomewhere, Ike, there must be a place where a feller can use up the\nrest of his misspent life without hidin\u2019 behind a stump every time a\nhuman bein\u2019 shows up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get transportation,\u201d says I. \u201cLet\u2019s go boldly and take a\nhorse per each from the tie-rack, and go hence rapidly.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a crowd in front of Sam Holt\u2019s place. Me and Dirty went right to\nthe rack, picked a likely looking bronc per each and got aboard, minus\nsaddles and with nothing on their hammer-heads but hackamores and hair.\n\nMan, I thought that mouse-colored animile could do everything in the\nbook, but this long-legged roan proved to me that my other mount was\npeckin\u2019 along in the kindergarten class.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nHigh and mighty we went. We changed ends, sunfishin\u2019 and worm-fencin\u2019,\nbut Ike Harper didn\u2019t pull leather\u2014\u2019cause there wasn\u2019t any; but he sure\ndid anchor himself to that bronc\u2019s mane with both hands, got a toe-holt\nunder each shoulder and rode regardless of sun, moon, or tide.\n\nI gets a glimpse of Dirty Shirt Jones ahead of me, and I\u2019d tell a man\nDirty is high above that animile\u2019s back, the same of which ain\u2019t healthy\nto nervous systems nor stummicks.\n\nInto that crowd we went, \u2014\u2014ity blip. I got a rope under my chin, the\nsame of which cut off my wind. Somebody got one arm around my neck and\nseems to caress me, and then I\u2019m out in the open, far from the maddening\ncrowd. I manages to get a breath, shoves the encircling arm from around\nmy neck and finds that there\u2019s two of us.\n\nI\u2019m all mixed up in a rope. Out of the dark comes another rider, just as\nmy bronc gets hoppled in this danged rope, and turns a handspring. This\nother horse goes over the top of us, and as far as I\u2019m concerned the\nearth and sky have met.\n\nLater on I removes the veil and comes back to material things. All is\ndark and dreary. I hears Dirty singing, soft and low\u2014\n\n\u201cI sa-a-a-a-w the-e-e-e new Jee-e-e-ru-u-u-u-sa-a-a-lem\u2014\u201d and on every\nword he quavers like some one was shaking his soul.\n\n\u201c\u2014\u2014!\u201d says I. \u201cI went further back than that, Dirty. I saw the old\ntown.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014le-e-e-e-e-e-ft up your voice and see-e-e-ng,\u201d wails Dirty.\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t got none to lift!\u201d I yells, and Dirty stops. Then he says\u2014\n\n\u201cIke, I\u2014I feel that my days are numbered.\u201d\n\n\u201cMine too\u2014thirteen,\u201d says I, and just then we hears a faint voice\nsaying:\n\n\u201cO-o-o-oh! O-o-o-oh!\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes your horse talk English, Ike?\u201d whispers Dirty, and just then a dim\nfigure reels up to us and sets down. It\u2019s still got some rope around its\nneck. We peers at it, and then Dirty scratches a match. It\u2019s Waldemar,\nwearing a half-inch rope for a necktie. He was the man I picked up on my\nway through the crowd.\n\n\u201cWaldemar,\u201d says Dirty, \u201cwe welcome you to our graveyard.\u201d\n\nHe wheezes for a moment and then manages to croak:\n\n\u201cTake that money back! Take it back!\u201d\n\n\u201cBack to the bank,\u201d he wheezes, when we don\u2019t say anything. \u201cThey\u2014they\nwas hanging me, bub-because I\u2014I told \u2019em it was just a picture stunt.\nTake the money back!\u201d\n\n\u201cWay around \u2019em, Shep,\u201d gasps Dirty. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get no money. Dang it,\nthere wasn\u2019t anybody in the bank!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d wails Waldemar. \u201cI seen you. I got a hundred feet of\nthe best hold-up on earth, and they were going to hang me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we didn\u2019t rob the \u2014\u2014 bank!\u201d I yowls.\n\nWaldemar is silent for a while and then he says, weary-like\u2014\n\n\u201cWell, somebody did.\u201d\n\n\u201cI dimly remember tellin\u2019 Big Foot and Hoodoo what we was goin\u2019 to do,\u201d\nsays Dirty, sad-like. \u201cThat must \u2019a\u2019 been them two that Scenery brought\nto jail.\u201d\n\nMe and Dirty gets to our feet. My feet don\u2019t line up good, but I\u2019m too\ngood to lay down and quit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just walk,\u201d says Dirty, sad-like; \u201cjust walk and walk until we\nfinds the place which is farthest from Piperock, and then we\u2019ll beg,\nborrow or steal some broncs and keep on goin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about me?\u201d wails Waldemar.\n\nWe stops and looks at him, kinda wondering-like.\n\n\u201cI must go back and get my film and camera before I leave,\u201d says he,\napologetic-like. \u201cThen where shall I go?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo just as yuh please,\u201d says Dirty, \u201cbut as far as me and Ike Harper\nare concerned, all things bein\u2019 equal, you can take your \u2014\u2014 creepin\u2019\ntintypes and go plumb to \u2014\u2014!\u201d\n\nWe pilgrims away in the darkness, two sufferin\u2019 souls, holding hands\nthat our feet may keep pointing ahead. We\u2019re in no shape to walk and\nDirty says:\n\n\u201cSlow up, can\u2019t yuh? They\u2019re lookin\u2019 for Big Foot and Hoodoo, not us.\nScenery likely thinks he\u2019s got snakes. Don\u2019t go so fast, yuh\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSa-a-a-y!\u201d yowls Waldemar, far away. \u201cThey made me tell who done it.\u201d\n\nWe didn\u2019t answer him. Dirty said\u2014\n\n\u201cMy \u2014\u2014, ain\u2019t yuh got no speed a-tall, Ike?\u201d\n\nTHE END",
