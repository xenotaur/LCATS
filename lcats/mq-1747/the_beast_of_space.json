    "body": "Here the dark cave, along which Nat Starrett had been creeping,\nbroadened into what his powerful searchlight revealed to be a low,\nwide, smoothly circular room. At his feet lapped black, thick-looking\nwaves of an underground lake, a pool of viscous substance that gave off\na penetrating, poignant odor of acid, sweetish and intoxicating, unlike\nany acid he knew. The smell rolled up in a sickening, sultry cloud that\npenetrated his helmet, made him cough and choke. Near its center\nprojected from the sticky stuff what appeared to be the nose of a\nspaceship.\n\nHe looked down near his feet at the edge of the pool where thick,\nslowly-moving tongues of the liquid appeared to reach up toward him, as\nif intent on pulling him into its depths. As each hungry wave fell\nback, it left a slimy, snake-like trail behind.\n\nNow came a wave of strange music, music such as he had never heard\nbefore. Faintly it had begun some time back, so faintly he was barely\naware of it. Now it swelled into a smooth, impelling wail lulling him\ninto drowsiness. He did not wonder why he could hear through the\nsoundproof space helmet he wore; he ceased to wonder about anything.\nThere was only the strange sweetness of acid and the throbbing music.\n\nAbruptly the spell was broken by something shrilling in his brain,\nsending little chills racing up and down his spine. Digger! A small,\noddly canine-like creature with telepathic powers, a space-dweller\nwhich men found when first they came to the asteroids. The relationship\nbetween spacehounds and men was much the same as between man and dog in\nthe old, earthbound days. Appropriate name for the beast, Digger. With\nthose large, incredibly hard claws, designed for rooting in the metal\nmake-up of the asteroids for vital elements, the spacehound could\neasily have shredded the man's spacesuit and helmet, could, at any time,\ntear huge chunks out of men's fine ships.\n\nThe half-conscious man jerked his thin form erect. His mouth, which had\ngaped loosely, closed with a snap into firm lines.\n\n\"She isn't in this hell hole, Digger. You wouldn't expect her to be\nwhere we could find her easily.\"\n\nScooping the small beast up under his good arm, he quickly climbed the\nsteep, slimy slope of the cave. The other arm in his suit hung empty.\nThat empty arm in the spacesuit told the story of an earthman become\nvoluntary exile, choosing the desolation of space to the companionship\nof other humans who would deluge him with unwonted sympathy. The\nspacehound was friendly in its own fashion; fortunately, such complex\nthings as sympathy were apparently outside its abilities. The two could\ninterchange impressions of danger, comfort, pleasure, discomfort, fear,\nand appreciation of each other's company, but little more. Whether or\nnot the creature could understand his thoughts, he could not tell.\n\nAs he went on, he reviewed, mentally, the events leading up to his\nlanding here. The sudden appearance on his teleview screen of the\nface and slim shoulders of a girl. Her attractiveness plainly\ndistinguishable through her helmet; for a moment he forgot that he\ndisliked women. The call for help, cut short ... but not before he had\nlearned that apparently she was being held prisoner on Asteroid Moira.\nHe knew he'd have to do what he could even if it meant unwonted\ncompany for an indefinite length of time. The spell was gone soon\nafter her face vanished; he remembered former experiences with\nattractive-looking girls. Damn traditions!\n\nA change in his course and a landing on Asteroid Moira. Here he'd\nfound a honeycomb of caves, all leading from one large main tunnel.\nThe cavern walls had been of a translucent, quartz-like substance,\nranging in color from yellowish-brown to violet-grey. It looked\nvaguely familiar, yet he could not place it. There was not time to\nexamine it more carefully.\n\nThe room in which he'd found the evil, hungry lake had been the first\none to the right. Now he crossed to the opening in the opposite wall.\nThe mouth of this cave was much larger, wider than the other. He stood\nin the opening, slowly swung the beam of his torch around the smooth\nwalls, still holding Digger, who, by now, was indicating that he'd like\nto be set down. Nat released him unthinkingly, his mind fully taken up\nwith what the light revealed.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nSpaceships! The room was packed with them--all sizes, old and new. A\nveritable sargasso. At first, he thought they might be craft belonging\nto nameless inhabitants of this world, but, as he approached them, he\nrecognized Terrestrial identifications.\n\nThe first was a scout ship of American Spaceways! Nat recognized the\nname: _Ceres_, remembered a telecast account of its disappearance in\nspace. There was a neat little reward for information as to its\nwhereabouts. Nat's lips curled in derision: it wouldn't equal the\nexpense of his journey out here. There was a deep groove in the smooth\nmaterial of the floor where the ship had been dragged through the\ndoorway into the room. What machines could have done this work without\nleaving their own traces? He went to the other ships: all were small,\nmostly single or two-passenger craft. The last entry in the logs of\nmany was to the effect that they were about to land on the Asteroid\nMoira to rescue a girl held captive there.\n\nNone had crashed; all ships were in perfect order. But all were\ndeserted. Two doors were gone from the interior of one of the vessels.\nThey might have been removed for any of a hundred reasons--but why\nhere?\n\nNat's glance swept the room, came to rest on the figure of a heavy duty\nrobot of familiar design. Semi-human in form, it looked like some\nmisshapen, bent, headless giant. He inspected it: _Meyers Robot, Inc._\nEarth designed for mining operations on Mars.\n\n\"Well, Digger, I can see now how these ships were brought in here; that\nrobot could move any one of these with ease. But that doesn't explain\nwhere the humans have gone. It might be space pirates using this\nasteroid for a base, or it might be some alien form of life. We're\nstill free. Shall we beat it or stay and try to check this out?\"\n\nHe did not know how much of this got over to the spacehound, but the\nimpressions he received in answer were those of approving their\nremaining where they were.\n\n\"I suppose the best system is to explore the rest of the caves in\norder; let's go.\"\n\nFollowed by Digger, he walked quietly toward the next cave on the left,\nslipped through the doorway, and, standing with his back against the\nwall, swung the light of his torch in a wide, swift arc about the room.\nHalfway around, he stopped abruptly; a slim, petite figure appeared\nclearly in the searchlight's glare. The girl he had seen on the\ntelevisor stood in the middle of the room, facing a telecaster, her\nback toward him. She did not seem aware of him as he moved forward.\nWhat could be wrong; surely that light would arouse her.\n\nThe figure did not turn as he approached. So near was he now that he\ncould seize her easily, still she made no move. Nat stepped to one\nside, flashed his torch in her face. Her beautifully-lashed eyes stared\nstraight ahead unblinkingly; the expression on her lovely composed face\ndid not change. A robot! He laughed bitterly. But then, he was not the\nonly one....\n\nShe was an earth product; Nat opened her helmet and found the\ntrade-mark of _Spurgin's Robots_ hung like a necklace about her throat.\nBut whoever had lured him here easily could have removed her from one\nof the vessels in the front cave. It did not seem like the work of\npirates, more likely unknown intelligent beings.\n\nHe turned to examine the televisor. It, too, was an earth product. The\nmechanism was of old design; evidently it had been taken from the first\nof the ships to land here. Outside of the telecaster and the solitary\nrobot, there was nothing to be seen in this cave.\n\nA sound behind him. He whirled, heat-rod poised for swift, stabbing\naction. Nothing--except--small bowling-ball things rolling in through\na narrow door. Ridiculous things of the same yellowish-quartz material\nas composed the cave-walls. At regular intervals a dull, bluish light\npoured forth from rounded holes in their smooth sides. And issuing\nforth from within these comic globes was the same weird, compelling\nmusic he had heard before. They rolled up to him, brushed against his\ntoes; a shrilling in his brain told him that Digger was aware of them.\n\n\"Back, Digger!\" he thought as he drew away from the globes. They poured\ntheir penetrating blue light over him, inspectingly, while the music\nfrom within rose and fell in regular cadences, sweetly impelling and\ndulling to the senses as strong oriental incense.\n\nBut Digger was not soothed. The spacehound lunged at one of the globes;\ninstead of slashing its sides, he found himself sailing through the\nair toward it. Nat received impressions of irritation combined with\nastonishment. Within the globes, the music rose to a furious whine\nwhile one of the things shot forth long tentacles from the holes in its\nside. Lightning-swift they shot forth, wrapped themselves about the\nbody of the spacehound, constricting. Digger writhed vainly, his claws\npowerless to tear at the whip-like tentacles. Nat severed the tentacles\nat their base with the heat-beam.\n\nHe turned, strode toward the door watching the spheres apprehensively\nout of the corner of his eye, ready to jump aside should they roll\ntoward him suddenly. But they followed at respectful distances, singing\nsoftly.\n\nBefore he reached the door, he found himself walking in rhythm to the\nmusic, his head swaying. It came slowly, insidiously; before he was\naware, his body no longer obeyed his will. Muscles refused to move\nother than in coordination with the music. His arm relaxed, the\nheat-rod sliding from his grasp.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Digger! The spacehound sent out a barrage of vibrations that fairly\nrocked his brain out of his skull. Simultaneously, the beast attacked\nthe nearest globes, tearing fiercely at them. Rapidly the others rolled\naway, but two lay torn and motionless, the music within them stilled.\n\nNat reached down, retrieved the heat-rod. \"I think we'd better look for\na 'squeaker'. Next time they might get you, Digger.\"\n\nThey returned to the room of the spaceships, seeking one of the small,\nportable radio-amplifiers used for searching out radium. It was known\nas a \"squeaker\" because of the constant din it made while in use; the\nnoise would cease only when radium was within a hundred feet of the\nmechanism. He found one after searching a few of the smaller ships.\n\nWith the portable radio strapped to his back, power switched on, he\nstarted again down the main tunnel. The globes set up their seductive\nrhythms as before, but he could not hear them above the discord of his\nsqueaker. Failing to lure him as before, they sought to force him in\nthe direction they desired him to go by darting at him suddenly,\nlashing him with their tentacles. But it was a simple thing to elude\nthem. Still remained the question: why could they want to lure him into\nthat stinking pool of acid?\n\nHe flashed a beam of heat at the nearest of the annoying globes. Under\nthe released energy it glowed, yet did not melt. But the tentacles\nsheared off and the blue lights faded. The flow of music changed to\nshrill whines as of pain and its rolling ceased. The others drew back;\nhe turned down another tunnel.\n\nThey stopped at the cave beyond the one where he had found the\nrobot-girl. It was sealed by a locked door, one of the airlock-doors\nfrom that space vessel, firmly cemented into the natural opening of the\ncave.\n\nNat bent forward, listening, his helmeted head pressed against the\ndoor. No sound. He was suddenly aware of the dead silence that pressed\nin on him from all sides now that the globes no longer sang and his\n\"squeaker\" had been turned off. The powerful energy of his heat-beam\nsputtered as it melted the lock into incandescent droplets which\nsizzled as they trickled down the cold metal of the door. The greasy,\nquartz-like material at the side of the door glowed in the heat from\nhis rod, but no visible effect upon it could be seen. What was that\nmaterial? He knew, yes, he knew--but he could not place a mental finger\non it.\n\nHe thrust the shoulder of his good arm against the heavy door, swung it\ninwards, stepped inside. The light of his torch pierced the silence,\npicked out a human skeleton in one corner. He hurried toward it--no, it\nwas not entirely a skeleton as yet. The flesh and bone had been eaten\naway from the lower part of the body to halfway up the hips, as though\nfrom some strong acid. The rest of the large, sturdy frame lay sunken\nunder the remains of a spacesuit which was tied clumsily around the\nmiddle to retain all the air possible in the upper half of it.\nEvidently some acid had eaten away the lower half of the man's body\nafter he had suffocated. The face was that of a Norwegian.\n\nBy one outstretched hand a small notebook lay open with the leather back\nupward. The corners of several pages were turned under carelessly--Nat\nswung the torch around the room. It was bare. The notebook--quickly he\npicked it up. The page on which the writing began was dated May 10,\n2040. About two months ago.\n\n\"Helmar Swenson. My daughter, Helena, aged nineteen, and I were lured\ninto the maw of this hellish monster by a robot calling for help in our\ntelevision screen. This thing, known to man as Asteroid Moira, is, in\nactuality, one of the gigantic mineral creatures which inhabited a\nplanet before it exploded, forming the asteroids. Somehow it survived\nthe catastrophe, and, forming a hard, crustaceous shell about itself,\nhas continued to live here in space as an asteroid.\n\n\"It is apparently highly intelligent and has acquired an appetite for\nhuman flesh. The singing spheres act as its sensory organs, separated\nfrom the body and given locomotion. It uses these to lure victims into\nits stomach in the first cave. I escaped its lure at first because\nof the 'squeaker' I carried with me. We set up these two doors as a\nprotection from the beast while we stayed here to examine it. But the\nmonster got me when I fell and the 'squeaker' was broken. My daughter\nrescued me after the acid of the pool had begun eating away my flesh.\n\n\"My Helena is locked in the room opposite this one. She has food and\nwater to last until July 8th. Oxygen seeps in there somehow--the beast\nwants to keep her alive until it can get her out of the room to devour\nher.\"\n\nHere the writing became more cramped and difficult to read.\n\n\"I have put the key in my mouth to prevent the spheres from opening the\ndoor should they force their way into this room. Some one must come to\nsave my Helena. I can't breathe--\"\n\nThe writing ended in a long scrawl angling off the page. The pencil lay\nsome distance from the body.\n\nJuly 8th! But that had been almost a week ago!\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe unscrewed the man's helmet, tried to pry the jaws open. They would\nnot move; the airless void surrounding the tiny planetoid had frozen\nthe body until now it was as solid as the quartz cave-walls. There was\nbut one thing to do: the other door must be melted down.\n\nHe leaped halfway across the room toward the door in the opposite wall.\nCould it be possible that he was in time? Anxiously he flung a bolt of\nenergy from his heat rod toward the lock, holding a flashlight under\nthe other stump of an arm. The molten metal flowed to the floor like a\nrivulet of lava.\n\nThe door, hanging off balance, screeched open; air swooshed past him in\nits sudden escape from the room. He squeezed himself through, peered\ncarefully about to see a slim spacesuit start to crumple floorward in\na corner. The girl was alive!\n\nHe started toward her; the slim figure pulled itself erect again. He\nsaw a drawn, emaciated face behind the helmet. Then, with a fury that\nunnerved him, she whipped out a heat rod, shot a searing bolt in his\ndirection. He felt the fierce heat of it as it whizzed past his\nshoulder; in his brain Digger's thoughts of attack came to him, he\nflung an arm around the spacehound, dragged it back as he withdrew\ntoward the door. The girl continued to fire bolt after bolt straight\nahead, her eyes wide and staring.\n\nThey made the door, waited outside while the firing within continued.\nWhen at last it was still within, he peered around the corner of the\nroom. She lay in a crumpled heap in the corner; quietly he re-entered,\npicked her up awkwardly. Through the thin, resistant folds of the\nspacesuit, he could feel the warmth of her, but could not tell whether\nthe heart still beat or not. They would have to take her to one of the\nships.\n\nHer limp form was held tightly under his good arm as Nat hurried down\nthe main tunnel. Digger apparently realized the seriousness of the\nsituation, for he received impressions of \"must hurry\" from the beast\nand another creature, looking much like him, surrounded by small\ncreatures of the same type, trapped in a crevice. \"Aren't you a bit\npremature, old fellow,\" he chided.\n\nHalfway there, the globes met them again. The things were not singing;\nfrom their many eyes poured a fierce, angry blue light. They rolled\nwith a determination that frightened him. Yet he strode on, until they\nwere barely a foot away.\n\n\"Jump, Digger!\"\n\nThe spheres stopped short, reversed their direction toward the little\ngroup at a furious rate, flinging out long, whip-like tentacles. One\nwrapped itself around Nat's ankle, drew him down. He shifted the limp\nform over to his shoulder, slipped out his heat-rod. Quickly the\ntentacle was severed. But now others took their place; he continued\nfiring at them, making each bolt tell, but the numbers were too great.\n\nDigger sprang into action, rending the globes with those claws that\nwere capable of tearing the hulls of spaceships. But tentacles lashed\naround him from the rear, snaked about him so that he was helpless.\n\nThe girl was slipping off Nat's shoulder. He could not raise the stump\nof an arm to balance her; it was stiff and useless. He stopped firing\nlong enough to make the shift, even as the spheres attacked again. The\nbolts had put out the lights in fully half of the marauders but the\nothers came on unafraid.\n\nNat straddled Digger's writhing body, held the spacehound motionless\nbetween his legs. At short range, he seared off the imprisoning\ntentacles, knowing that it would take far more than a heat-bolt to\ndamage the well-nigh impregnable creature. He swooped the dog up under\nhis good arm and fled from the madly-pursuing spheres, thanking\nnameless deities that the gravity here permitted such herculean feats.\nThe spheres rolled faster, he soon found, than he could jump; so long\nas he was above them, all was well, but by the time the weak gravity\npermitted him to land, they were waiting for him. He tried zig-zagging.\nGood! It worked. He eluded them up to the mouth of the cave, then\njumped for the door of his ship's outer airlock.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nNat placed the girl in his bunk, removed the cumbersome spacesuit. Her\neyes blinked faintly, then sprang open. But they did not see him; they\nwere staring straight ahead. Her mouth opened and shut weakly as though\nshe were speaking, but no sound issued from it. He brought her water,\nbut when he returned she had fallen asleep. He returned to the kitchen\nto prepare some food.\n\n\"You're still running around in that pillow case,\" he remarked to\nDigger as he extracted the spacehound from it. \"Attend me, now. We know\nwhy and how those people disappeared. It would take the Space Patrol\nship at least a month to arrive here; I don't intend to perch on the\nback of this devil as long as that. And if we leave, old thing, it'll\njust lure other chivalrous fools to very unpleasant ends.\n\n\"And we've got to get this kid back to civilization. She needs a\ndoctor's care, preferably a doctor with two arms.\"\n\nDigger's vibrations were one of general approval.\n\n\"We could poison it,\" he went on. \"Only I'm not a chemist; even if I\nknew the compounds contained in that reeking stomach I wouldn't know\nwhat would destroy them. Might blow it up, but we haven't enough\nexplosive.\n\n\"No, we'll have to get down into the thing's insides again. In fact--\"\nHe paused suddenly, mouth open. \"Congratulate me, Digger! I have it!\"\n\nThe smell of burning vegetables cut short his soliloquy. He fed the\nstarved, half-blind girl, then left her sleeping exhaustedly as he\nsquirmed into his suit.\n\nNo sooner had he entered the mouth of the cave than a half-dozen of the\nsinging sensory organs rolled quickly, yet not angrily, toward him. The\nbeast was apparently optimistic, for the globes sang in their most\nsoothing, seductive tones. They tried to herd him into the first cave\non the right, but he had remembered the _squeaker_; they could not\ndistract him.\n\nEffortlessly he leaped over them toward the mouth of the cave on the\nleft. That was where the spaceships lay, pointing in all directions\nlike a carelessly-dropped handful of rice.\n\nAll the ships were in running order. Good; had there been one vessel he\ncould not move, then all was lost. The fuel in several ran low, but\nafter a few moments of punching levers and pulling chokes, the under\nrockets thundered in the big room.\n\nTaking care not to injure the motor compartments of the other ships,\nusing only the most minute explosion-quantities, he jockeyed each ship\naround until all their noses pointed in one direction. The exhausts\npointed out through the wide doorway. It was well that the beast had\nformed curved corners in the room, otherwise the scheme would not have\nworked. The exhausts which did not point toward the door, directly,\nwere toward the curved walls which would deflect the forceful gasses\nexpelled doorward.\n\nWhen he emerged from the ship, the spheres attacked. He seared off\ntheir tentacles throughout what seemed to be eternities. His body was\nbecoming a mass of bruises from the lash of their tentacles. He burned\nhis way through the swarm on to ship after ship.\n\nAs he stepped from the last vessel there was a rumbling beneath his\nfeet. Did the monster understand his intent? Was it stirring in its\nshell? Most of the globes had disappeared; now a nauseatingly sweet\nodor penetrated the screen in his headpiece, which permitted him to\nsmell without allowing the oxygen to escape. He hurried around to the\nrear of the ship, an apprehensive, sickening feeling at the pit of his\nstomach. A thick jelly-like wave of liquid was rolling over the\nfloor--the reeking, deadly juices from the beast's stomach. If the\nliquid touched him, it would eat through the heavy fabric, exploding\nthe air pressure from around his body. How was he to escape from the\ncave?\n\nThe answer came to him suddenly. Quickly he darted back toward the\nnearest vessel. Two of the screaming spheres blocked his way; he sent\nbolt after searing bolt into them, more of a charge than he had given\nany of the others. The lights in the globes went out; their voices\nceased. And they burst into slowly mounting incandescence. Yet, they\nwere not consumed by their fire, only glowed an intense white light\nlike that of a lighthouse.\n\n\"Lighthouse!\" The word flashed through his mind clearly, strongly. They\nglowed like the \"zirconia lights\" of a lighthouse. Why hadn't he\nrecognized the greasy, quartz-like material before? It was zirconia, a\ncompound of zirconium, of course. A silicate base creature could easily\nhave formed a shell of it about itself.\n\nZirconia--one of the compounds he'd intended prospecting for on the\nmoons of Saturn. Worth over a hundred dollars per pound. Because of its\nresistance to heat, it was used to line the tubes of rockets; Terra's\nsupply had long been used up. Here was a fortune all around him; but\nthat fortune was about to be destroyed, he along with it, if he did not\nhurry.\n\nIf he could only reach the timing mechanism to yank from it the wires\nconnecting it to the other ships. It was at the other end of the line.\nHe started in that direction, but a surge of fatal, thick acid rolled\nbefore him, reaching for him with hungry, questing tongues.\n\nWhen it was almost touching his toes, he leaped. As he floated toward\nthe floor, he placed a chair beneath him so that his feet landed on the\nseat. The legs of the chair sank slowly into the liquid.\n\nAgain he leaped, his moment retarded by the fluid which now reached\nhalfway up the chair legs, sucked and clung there. The sweetly-evil\nsmelling stuff was rising rapidly. But the next leap carried him into\nthe main cave. Abandoning the chair, he leaped once more, out through\nthe cave's mouth, pursued by the waving tentacles of the sensory\nspheres.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had lost precious minutes eluding that deadly acid. It would take\nat least five minutes to get his ship away from the asteroid; he must\nhurry before all those rocket motors were thrown into action, or it\nwould be too late.\n\nLeap and leap again. It seemed ages, but he reached the ship, bolted\nthe door shut. Thumps against the door as the pursuing globes ran up\nagainst it. A thought came to him; swiftly he opened the door,\npermitted a few of them to enter, then slammed it shut. With the heat\ngun he sheared off their tentacles; he could sell the zirconia in the\nentities. Then he turned to the controls and the ship zoomed up and\nout.\n\nNat had barely raised his ship from the Asteroid Moira when he saw the\nsmall planetoid lurch suddenly, bounding off its orbit at almost a\nright angle. The sudden combined driving force of all the rockets\nwithin the cave had sent it hurtling away like a rocket itself.\n\nThe asteroid housing the monster was heading into the Flora group of\nAsteroids. There the fifty-seven odd solid bodies of that group would\ngrind, crack, and rend that dangerous beast into harmless, dead\nfragments.\n\n\"A good job,\" said a weak, but softly friendly voice behind him. He\nwhirled. The girl stood in the doorway of the pilot room, supporting\nherself against the door frame. Digger rubbed thoughtfully against her\nlegs.\n\n\"We'll just follow that asteroid, Miss,\" he said, \"and see if we can't\npick up some odd fragment of zirconia when it's smashed in the\ngrindstone there. Then we'll light out for Terra.\"\n\nShe smiled. Earth, to him, seemed like a very good place to go as soon\nas possible.\n\n\n\n   This e-text was produced from Comet July 1941.
