    "body": "Once when I was doing a hitch with the Shaulan Space Guard out Scorpio\nway, my partner Jeff Bogart developed just about the most harmless\npsychosis you could imagine: he got himself an imaginary companion.\n\nAnd the imaginary companion turned out to be me.\n\nWell, I\u2019m a pretty nice guy and so having two of me in the ship didn\u2019t\nseem a particularly bad idea. At first. In fact there\u2019d be advantages of\nit, I thought. For instance, Jeff liked to talk a weary lot ... and the\nimaginary Joe Hansen could spell me listening to him, while I projected\na book or just harkened to the wheels going around in my own head\nagainst the faint patter of starlight on the hull.\n\nI met Jeff first at a space-rodeo, oddly enough, but now the two of us\nwere out on a servicing check of the orbital beacons and relays and\nrescue depots of the five planets of the Shaulan system. A completely\nroutine job, its only drawback that it was lengthy. Our ship was an\nionic jeep that looked like a fancy fountain pen, but was very roomy for\nthree men\u2014one of them imaginary.\n\nI caught on to Jeff\u2019s little mania by overhearing him talking to me. I\u2019d\nbe coming back from the head or stores or linear accelerator or my bunk,\nand I\u2019d hear him yakking at me. It embarrassed me the first time, how to\ngo back into the cabin when the other me was there. But I just swam in,\nand without any transition-strain at all that I could observe Jeff\nlooked around at me, smiling sort of glaze-eyed, and said warmly, \u201cJoe.\nMy buddy Joe. Am I glad they paired us.\u201d\n\nIf Jeff had a major fault, as opposed to a species of nuttiness, it was\nthat he was strictly a speak-only-good, positive-thinking guy who always\ndeferred to me. Even idolized me, if you can imagine that. He\u2019d give me\nsuch fulsome praise I\u2019d be irked ten times an orbit.\n\nAnother thing that helped me catch on was that he always called the\nother me Joseph.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt first I thought the whole thing might be a gag, or maybe a deliberate\nway of letting off steam against me without violating his\nalways-a-sweet-guy code\u2014like happy husbands cursing in the bathroom\u2014but\nthen came the scrambled eggs.\n\nI\u2019d slept late and when I squinted into the cabin there was Jeff\nhovering over a plate of yellow fluff and shaking his finger at my empty\nseat and saying, \u201cDammit, Joseph, eat your scrambled eggs, I cooked \u2019em\n\u2019specially for you,\u201d and when he crawfished out toward the galley a\ncouple seconds later he was saying, \u201cNow you start on those eggs,\nJoseph, before I get back.\u201d\n\nI thought for a bit and then I slid into my place and polished them off.\n\nWhen he floated in with the coffee he gave me another of those\nglaze-eyed God-fearing looks\u2014but just a mite disappointed, I thought\u2014and\nsaid, \u201cDammit, Joe, you\u2019re perfect! You always clean your plate.\u201d\n\nApparently when I was there, Joseph just didn\u2019t exist for Jeff. And vice\nversa. It was sort of eerie, especially with the hum of space in my ears\nlike a seashell and nobody else for five million miles.\n\nBeginning with the scrambled eggs, I discovered that Jeff didn\u2019t exactly\nidolize Joseph\u2014or even take with him the attitude of \u201cMy buddy can do no\nwrong,\u201d like he did with me. I overheard him criticizing Joseph.\nReasonably at first; then I heard him chewing him out\u2014next bullying him.\n\nIt made me wistful, that last, thinking how good it would feel to be\nfull-bloodedly cursed to my face once in a while instead of all the\nsweetness and light. And right there I got the idea for some amateur\ntherapy, Shaula-Deva help me.\n\nI waited for a moment when we were both relaxed and then I said, \u201cJeff,\nthe trouble with you is you\u2019re too nice. You ought to criticize things\nmore. For a starter, criticize me. Tell me my faults. Go ahead.\u201d\n\nHe flushed a little and said, \u201cDammit, Joe, how can I? You\u2019re perfect!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo man is perfect, Jeff,\u201d I told him solemnly, feeling pretty foolish.\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re my buddy I always can trust,\u201d he protested, squirming a bit.\n\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t talk this way.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201cJeff, you can\u2019t trust anybody too far,\u201d I said. \u201cEven good guys can do\nbad things. When I was a boy there was a kid named Harry I practically\nworshipped. We lived on a pioneer world of Fomalhaut that had good snow,\nand we\u2019d hitch rides with our sleds off little airscrew planes taking\noff. We\u2019d each have a long white line on his sled and loop it beforehand\naround the plane\u2019s tail-gear and back to the sled. Then we\u2019d hide. As\nsoon as the pilot got aboard we\u2019d jump on our sleds and each grab the\nfree end of his line and have one comet of a ride, until the plane took\noff. Then we\u2019d quick let go.\n\n\u201cWell, one frosty morning I let go and nothing happened, except I\nstarted to rise. Harry had tied the free end of my line tight to my\nsled.\n\n\u201cI could have just rolled off, I suppose, but I didn\u2019t want to lose my\nsled or my line either. Luckily I had a sheath knife handy and I used\nit. I even made a whizeroo of a landing. But ever afterwards my feelings\ntoward Harry\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cStop it, please, Joe!\u201d Jeff interrupted, very red in the face and\nshaking a little. \u201cThat boy Harry was utterly evil. And I don\u2019t want to\nhear any more about this, or anything like it, ever again. Understand?\u201d\n\nI told him sure I did. Heck, I could see I\u2019d gone the wrong way about\nit. I even begged his pardon.\n\nAfter that I just sweated it out. But I found I couldn\u2019t spend much time\non books or my thoughts, I\u2019d keep listening for what Jeff was saying to\nJoseph. And sometimes when he\u2019d pause for Joseph\u2019s reply I\u2019d catch\nmyself waiting for the imaginary me to make one. So I took to staying in\nthe same cabin as Jeff as much as I could.\n\nThat seemed to make him uncomfortable after a while, though he pretended\nto glory in it. He\u2019d ask me questions like, \u201cTell me about life, Joe. So\nI\u2019ll know how to handle myself if we\u2019re ever parted.\u201d\n\nBut the weariest things come to an end, even duty orbits around Shaula.\nAnd so the time came when we were servicing our last beacon\u2014outside the\nplanet Shaula-by, it was. Next step would be a fast interplanetary orbit\nfor Base at Shaula-near.\n\nI was out working\u2014on a safety line of course, but suit-jetting around\nmore than I needed to, just for the pure joy of it, so that my suit tank\nwas almost dry. I\u2019d switched my suit radio off for a bit, because,\nworking in space, Jeff had taken to just gabbling to me nervously all\nthe time\u2014maybe because he figured there couldn\u2019t be room for Joseph with\nhim in his suit.\n\nI finished up and paused for a last look at the ship. She was sweetly\nslim from her conical living quarters to the taper-tail of her ionic\njet, but she had more junk on her than an amateur asteroid prospector\nhangs on his suit the first time out. Every duty orbit, fifty scientists\ncome with permission from the Commandant to hang some automatic research\ngadget on the hull. The craziest one this time was a huge flattened band\nof gold-plated aluminum, little more than foil-thick, attached crosswise\njust in front of the tail and sticking out twenty feet on each side. I\ndon\u2019t know what it was there for\u2014maybe to measure the effects of space\non a Moebius strip\u2014but it looked like a wedding ring that had been\nstepped on. So Jeff and I called it Trompled Love.\n\nBut in spite of the junk, the ship looked mighty sweet against the\nsaffron steppes and baby-blue seas of Shaula-by with Shaula herself, old\nLambda Scorpii, flaming warm and wildly beyond, and with \u201cUnited States\u201d\nstanding out big as life on the ship\u2019s living quarters. United States of\nShaula, of course.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was almost dreaming out there, thinking how it hadn\u2019t been such a\nterrible duty after all, when I saw the ship begin to slide past Shaula.\n\nPoking out of her tail, ghostlier than the flame over a cafe royale, was\nthe evil blue glow of her jet. In an instant I\u2019d guessed exactly what\nhad happened and was beating myself on the head for not having\nanticipated it. Joseph had swum into the cabin right after Jeff. And\nJeff had yelled at him. \u201cIt\u2019s about time, you lazy lunkhead! Everything\nsecure? Okay, I\u2019m switching on the beam!\u201d And I\u2019d probably brought the\nwhole thing about by telling him that damfool sled story\u2014and then\nsticking to him so close he just had to get rid of me, so as to be with\nJoseph.\n\nMeanwhile the ship was gathering speed in her sneaky way and the wavy\nsafety line between me and the airlock was starting to straighten.\n\nAs you know, an ionic jet\u2019s only good space-to-space. It\u2019s not for\nheavy-G work; ours could deliver only one-half G at max and was doing\nless than one-quarter now. Which meant the ship was starting off slower\nthan most ground cars.\n\nBut the beam would fire for hours, building up to a terminal velocity of\nfifteen miles a second and carrying the ship far, far away from lonely\nJoe Hansen.\n\nExcept that we were tied together, of course.\n\nI was very grateful then for the weeks I\u2019d practiced space-roping,\nthough I\u2019d never won any prizes with it, because without thinking I\nstarted to whip my line very carefully. And on the third try, just as it\nwas getting pretty straight, I managed to settle it in a notch in one\noutside end of Trompled Love. After that I took up strain on the line as\ngradually as I could, letting it friction through my gloves for as long\nas I could before putting all my mass on it\u2014because although one-quarter\nG isn\u2019t much, it piles up in a few seconds to quite a jerk. I spread\nthat jerk into several little ones.\n\nWell, the last jerk came and the line didn\u2019t part and Trompled Love\ndidn\u2019t crumple much, though the Shaula-light showed me several very\nnasty-looking wrinkles in it. And there I was trailing along after the\nship, though out to one side, and feeling about as much strain on the\nline as if I were hanging from a cliff on the moon, and knowing I was\ngoing about five feet a second faster every second.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy idea wanting to be out to the side (and bless my impulses for\nrealizing it was the one important thing!) was to keep my line and\nmyself out of the beam. An ionic jet doesn\u2019t look hot from the side. But\nfrom straight on it\u2019s a lot brighter than an arc light\u2014it\u2019s almost as\ntight as a laser beam\u2014and I didn\u2019t want to think about what it would do\nto me, even trailing as I was a hundred yards aft.\n\nThough of course long before it had ruined me, it would have\ndisintegrated my line.\n\nMy being out to the side was putting the ship off balance on its jet and\npresumably throwing its course toward base and Shaula-near little by\nlittle into error. But that was the least of my worries, believe me.\n\nI thought for a bit and remembered I could talk to Jeff over my suit\nradio. I decided to try it, not without misgivings.\n\nI tongued it on and said, \u201cJeff. Oh, Jeff. I\u2019m out here. You forgot me.\u201d\n\nI was going to say some more, but just then he broke in, angry and so\nloud it made my helmet ring, with, \u201cJoseph! Did you hear anything then?\u201d\nA pause, then, \u201cWell, clean the wax out of your ears, stupid, because I\ndid! I think we got an enemy out there!\u201d\n\nAnother and longer pause, while my blood curdled a bit thicker, then,\n\u201cWell, okay, Joseph, I\u2019ll go along with you this time. But if I hear the\nenemy once more, I\u2019m going to suit up and take a rifle and sit in the\nairlock door until I\u2019ve potted him.\u201d\n\nI tongued the radio off quick, fearful I\u2019d sneeze or something. I had\nonly one faint consolation: Joseph seemed to be a bit on my side, or\nmaybe he was just lazy.\n\nI thought some more, a mite frantic-like now, and after a while I said\nto myself, _Been going five minutes now, so I\u2019m doing about a quarter of\na mile a second\u2014that\u2019s fifteen miles a minute, wow!\u2014but out here\nvelocities are purely relative. My suit does a little better than a\nquarter G full on. Okay. I\u2019ll jet to the ship._\n\nNo sooner said than acted on\u2014I was beginning to rely too much on impulse\nnow. The suit jet killed my false weight at once and I was off, mighty\ncareful to aim myself along my line or a little outside it, so as not to\nwander over into the beam.\n\nPretty soon the tail and Trompled Love were getting noticeably bigger.\n\nThen a lot bigger.\n\nThen my suit fuel ran out.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nI\u2019d built up enough velocity so that I was still gaining on the ship for\na few seconds. In fact, I almost made it. My gauntlet was about to close\non Trompled Love when the ship started slowly to pull away. Oh, it was\nfrustrating!\n\nI remembered then what I should have a lot earlier, and grabbed for the\nship-end of my line so as not to lose the distance I\u2019d gained\u2014and in my\nhaste I knocked it away from me. The only good thing was that I didn\u2019t\nknock it out of the notch.\n\nNow I was losing space to the ship faster and faster. Yet all I could do\nwas reel in the me-end of the line as fast as I could. Suddenly the\nwhole line straightened and gave me a bigger jerk than I\u2019d intended. I\ncould see Trompled Love crumple a little. And I was swinging just a bit,\nlike a pendulum.\n\nI used a glove-friction to spread the rest of the jerk, but still I was\nat the end of my line and Trompled Love had crumpled a bit more before I\nwas coasting along with the ship again.\n\nMy side of Trompled Love was bent back maybe twenty degrees. The eye of\nthe beam shone at me from the tail like a pale blue moon. For quite a\nwhile it brightened and dimmed as I tick-tock swung.\n\nMeanwhile I was beating my skull for not having thought earlier of the\nobvious slow-but-safe way of doing it, instead of that lunatic\nsuit-jetting. I once heard a psychologist say we\u2019re mental slaves to\npower-machinery and I guess he had something.\n\nClearly all I had to do was climb hand-over-hand up the line to the\nship. At moon gravity that would be easy. If I should get tired I only\nhad to clamp on and rest.\n\nSo I waited for my emotions to settle a bit, and then I reached along\nthe line and gave a smooth, medium-strength heave.\n\nMaybe there is something to ESP\u2014at least in a devilish sort of\nway\u2014because I picked the exact moment when Jeff decided to feed the beam\nmore juice.\n\nThere was a _big_ jerk and I saw Trompled Love crumple a lot, so that it\nwas pointing more than forty-five degrees aft.\n\nNow there was a steady pull on the line like I was hanging from a cliff\non Mars. And the eye of the beam was a blue moon not so pale\u2014in fact\nmore like a sizzling blue sun seen through a light fog.\n\nAfter that I just didn\u2019t have the heart to try the climb again. Once I\nstarted to draw myself up, very cautious, but on the first handhold I\nseemed to feel along the line Trompled Love crumpling some more and I\nquit for good.\n\nI figured that at this boost Jeff would be up to proper speed for\nShaula-near in less than two hours. Well, I had suit-oxy and\nrefrigeration for longer than that.\n\nOf course if Jeff decided not to cut the beam on schedule, maybe with\nthe idea of eloping with Joseph to the next solar system\u2014well, I\u2019d\ndiscover then whether suit-oxy running out would stimulate me to try the\nclimb again alongside the beam.\n\n(Or I could wait until he got her up near the speed of light, when by\nthe General Theory of Relativity the line ought to be shortened enough\nso that I could hop aboard if I were sudden enough about it.... _No, Joe\nHansen, you quit that_, I told myself, _you don\u2019t want to die with the\ngears in your head all stripped_.)\n\nThinking about the beam got me wondering exactly how close I was to it.\nI unshipped my suit-antenna and pulled it out to full length\u2014about eight\nfeet\u2014and fished around with it in the direction of the beam.\n\nNothing seemed to happen to it. It didn\u2019t glow or anything; but I\nsuddenly got a little electric shock, and when I drew it back I could\nsee three inches of the tip were gone and the next couple inches were\npitted. So much for curiosity.\n\nNext I reattached the antenna to my suit\u2014which turned out to be a lot\nmore troublesome job than unshipping it\u2014and tongued on the radio with\nthe idea of listening in on Jeff.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nRight away I heard him say, \u201cWake up, Joseph! I\u2019m going to tell you your\nfaults again. I got a new way of cataloguing them\u2014chronologically. Begin\nwith childhood. You hitched sled-rides on airplanes. That was bad,\nJoseph, that was against the law. If the man had caught you doing it, if\nhe\u2019d seen you whizzing along there back of him, he\u2019d have had every\nright to shoot you down in cold blood. Life is hard, Joseph, life is\nmerciless....\u201d\n\nRight then I felt a tickle in my throat.\n\nI tried quick to shut off the radio, but it is remarkably difficult to\ntongue anything when you have a cough coming. It came out finally in a\nseries of squeaky glubs.\n\n\u201cSnap to, Joseph, and listen hard,\u201d I heard Jeff say. \u201cIt\u2019s started\nagain. Animal noises this time. You know if they make spacesuits for\nblack panthers, Joseph?\u201d\n\nI tongued off the radio quick, before the follow-up cough came.\n\nI didn\u2019t have anything left to do now but think. So I thought about\nJeff\u2014how there seemed to be one Jeff who hated my guts and another Jeff\nwho idolized me and another Jeff sneaking around in a jungle of\nsabertooth tigers and ... heck, there was probably a good twenty Jeffs\nsitting around inside his skull, some in light, some in darkness, but\nall of them watching each other and arguing together all the time. It\nwas an odd way to think of a personality\u2014a sort of perpetual\n_Kaffeeklatsch_\u2014but it had its points. Maybe some of the little guys\nweren\u2019t Jeffs at all, but his father and mother and a caveman ancestor\nor two and maybe some great-great-grandchild butting in now and then\nfrom the future....\n\nWell, I saw that speculation was getting out of hand so, taking a tip\nfrom Jeff, I began to count my own sins.\n\nIt took quite a while. Some of them were pretty interesting reading,\nalmost enough to take my mind off my predicament, but I tired of it\nfinally.\n\nThen I began to count the stars.\n\nIt was really the longest two hours plus I ever spent, except maybe the\ntime my first big girl disappeared. But I don\u2019t know. The experiences\nare hard to compare.\n\nI was about halfway through the stars when I went weightless. For an\nawful instant I thought the line had parted at last, but then I looked\ntoward the ship and saw the bright little moon was gone.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nRight away I gave a couple of tugs on the line and began to close slowly\nwith the tail. No trouble at all\u2014actually my only difficulty was\nresisting the temptation to build up more momentum, which would have\nresulted in a crash landing.\n\nI softed-in on Trompled Love okay, except there was a big spark. The\nbeam must have charged me good. Then I worked my way to the true hull.\nAfter that there were handholds.\n\nFinally I got to a porthole in the living quarters, and I looked in, and\nthere was Jeff jawing away at my empty seat. I put my helmet against the\nhull and very faintly I heard him say, \u201cJoseph, I\u2019m still worried about\nthe enemy. I keep thinking I hear him or it. I\u2019m going to make us some\ncoffee, so we\u2019ll stay real alert. You break out the guns.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t suppose anyone ever moved quite so quietly _and_ so quickly in a\nspacesuit as I did then. I got in the airlock, I got her up to pressure,\nI got unsuited\u2014and all in less than five minutes, I\u2019m sure. Maybe less\nthan four.\n\nI swam to the cabin. It was empty. I slid into my seat just as Jeff\nfloated in with the coffee.\n\nHe went real pale when he spotted me. I saw there might be some trouble\nthis time with the Joseph-Joe transition. But I knew the only way to\nplay it was real cool. I nested there in my seat as if I hadn\u2019t a worry\nor urge in the world\u2014though my nerves and throat were just screaming for\na squirt of that coffee.\n\n\u201cJoe!\u201d he squeaked at last. \u201cMigod, you gave me an awful scare. I\nthought you\u2019d done a bunk, I thought, you\u2019d spaced yourself, I kept\npicturing you outside the ship.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy no, Jeff,\u201d I answered quietly. \u201cOne way or another, I\u2019ve been in\nthis seat ever since take-off.\u201d\n\nHis brow wrinkled as he thought about that.\n\nI looked at the board and noticed that our terminal trip-velocity read\nfifteen miles a second. My, my.\n\nFinally Jeff said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, you have.\u201d And then, just a shade\nunhappily, \u201cI might have known. You always tell the truth, Joe\u2014you\u2019re\nperfect.\u201d\n\n\n                                  END\n\n\n\nPunctuation has been normalized.
