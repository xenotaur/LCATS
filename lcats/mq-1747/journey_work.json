    "body": "In a central California tomato field a dusty-faced man opened the\nautodriver of a nuclear-powered truck and inserted a cannery's address\ncard so the truck would know where to deliver its load.\n\nSix old men--the tomato pickers--waited for their pay in the truck's\nlengthening shadow. Most of them smoked or dozed, too tired for talk.\n\nOllie Hollveg, tallest and oldest of the pickers, eyed the heavy-set\nrancher who sat at the tally table figuring the payroll. For this\nday's work Ollie expected even less pay than usual; the mumbling,\npencil-licking rancher--his name was Rost--seemed to be overacting the\nrole of harried proprietor.\n\nSoon Ollie saw his guess confirmed. A look of frustrated rage spread\nfrom face to face as each of the other pickers was in turn called to\nthe table and paid.\n\nAll were overage. None dared protest.\n\nAt seventy a poor man without relatives willing to care for him was\nsupposed to let himself be permanently retired to a Home for Seniles.\nIf he wasn't senile and didn't want a home with barred windows and a\nbarbed wire fence, he had to lie low and keep his mouth shut.\n\nAnyone could charge an overage person with incompetence. The charge was\nnot a crime and so had no defence.\n\nAll of which was old stuff to Ollie Hollveg. He'd been dodging the\ngeriatricians for sixteen years. He considered himself used to the\nsetup.\n\nYet something about the rancher, Rost--maybe his excessive weight, in\ncontrast with the pickers' under-fed gauntness, or maybe his cardboard\ncowboy boots and imitation sombrero--made Ollie boil in spite of\nhimself.\n\nHe tried not to show his feelings. But when he was called to the tally\ntable the rancher scowled up at him defensively and said, \"Don't\nglare at me, Hollveg! If you moved as fast picking tomatoes as you do\ncollecting your pay, you'd have earned more than this.\"\n\nHe pushed out a little pile of coins that came to four dollars\neighty-seven cents.\n\n\"Odd pennies?\" Ollie's voice broke as he fought to keep it under\ncontrol. \"Odd pennies, when picking's at the rate of two bits a lug?\nThat can't be right. Just because we're old, you're stealing from us!\"\n\nRost's fat face turned livid. \"Call me a thief?\" he sputtered. \"Get off\nmy land!\"\n\nRost jumped clumsily to his feet, upsetting the tally table. Ollie bent\nto retrieve the coins scattered in the dust.\n\n\"Don't try to steal from me!\" Rost shouted. He pulled out a small gas\ngun and discharged it under Ollie's nose. Ollie pitched forward onto\nhis face, twitched, moaned, and lay still.\n\n\n\nThe deputy sheriff held an ampoule under his nose and brought him to\nafter setting the squad car on the beamway, proceeding under remote\ncontrol toward the county seat.\n\nThe first thing Ollie thought of was his day's pay. He'd never received\nit. Worse--his bedroll was left behind. And there was no stopping nor\nturning on the beam way.\n\nHe complained bitterly.\n\n\"You won't need that stuff,\" the sharp young deputy said. \"Not where\nyou're going.\"\n\n\"I suppose Rost needs it!\" Ollie protested.\n\n\"He might at that. All he's got is those measily four rented acres of\ntomatoes. The cannery pays him the same as if he had four hundred acres\nand could pick by machine.\n\n\"About all the profit he can make is what he chisels out of his\npickers. You'll be better off in a Home, Pop, than trying to work\ncheaper than a machine.\"\n\n\"Those Homes are prisons!\"\n\nThe deputy sighed. \"I know how you feel. My old grandfather cried when\nwe put him in. But we couldn't support him and he had no way of making\na living.\n\n\"The world changes faster than the people in it, Pop. Science all the\ntime lets us live longer, but faster and faster it keeps changing the\nway we do things. An old guy falls so far behind the times, the only\nplace for him is a Home.\"\n\n\"But if a man wants to stay out,\" said Ollie, \"I don't see why he\ncan't.\"\n\n\"Old guys are dangerous to the rest of us. I saw three people killed,\nnot long ago, trying to dodge an oldtimer who walked too slow to get\nacross a wide street before the lights changed against him.\"\n\n\"They could have slowed the signal,\" Ollie said. \"But no! Always it's\nthe man who has to adapt to the machine, not the machine to the man.\nThe only way to get by in this world is to find some machine you just\nnaturally fit.\"\n\n\"You sound kind of bitter.\"\n\n\"Why not? I used to be a stock control clerk, keeping track of spare\nparts supply for a nationally distributed line of machine tools. I had\ntwenty girls working for me. Then one day they put in a big computer.\"\n\nHe sighed. \"No wonder these suicide salesmen do so well. If I had the\nmoney I'd hire somebody to knock me off right now.\"\n\n\"Don't be stupid!\" the deputy snarled. \"You wouldn't be losing your\nfreedom if you'd had sense enough to stay out of a fight. And when you\ntalk about suicide salesmen, you sure prove you can't take care of\nyourself!\"\n\nBut the deputy was kinder than he sounded. Rather than allege\nincompetence, he charged Ollie with an assault against Rost. So instead\nof being remanded to the geriatricians, Ollie was kept overnight in\njail and ordered held, next morning, for want of fifty dollars bail.\n\nAn hour after bail had been set, a dapper thin faced bailbond broker\ncame to see him.\n\n\"Want out?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"If I put up bail you'll be out.\"\n\n\"No Home?\"\n\n\"You're classified as a criminal, ineligible for a Home till either\nyou're found not guilty or serve your time.\"\n\n\"Well, but I'm broke. I can't buy a bailbond.\"\n\n\"You can work it off. I'm going to spring you right now. As soon as\nthey let you out, meet me in the southwest corner of the park, just\nacross from the post office.\"\n\nOllie did. He thought his bail had been arranged by the deputy.\n\nThe broker kept him waiting in the park for half an hour, but was brisk\nwhen he appeared.\n\n\"My name is Lansing,\" he said. \"Come on. We're taking a little trip.\"\n\nHe steered Ollie to the copter tower at the park's center and with him\nboarded its endless-belt manlift. They were carried ten stories to the\nroof, and as they stepped off the manlift an empty copter hovered at\nhand. It bore on sides and bottom an address, a phone number, and the\nword _Bailbonds_, all in big letters.\n\nThe copter rose under the tower's control as soon as they'd entered it,\nand continued to rise till Lansing selected a prepunched destination\ncard and slipped it into the auto-pilot. Then a knowing red light\nwinked on, the copter levelled off and headed southwest, and Lansing\ntook one of a pair of chintz-padded wicker seats, motioning Ollie into\nthe other.\n\n\"How do you like the idea of going to a Home?\" he asked abruptly.\n\n\"I'd rather be dead.\"\n\n\"I know someone who agrees with you. A fellow with bad health who wants\nto die but doesn't have the guts to do the necessary. Feel like helping\nhim out?\"\n\nOllie sighed, smiled grimly, and shook his head. \"No, thanks!\"\n\n\"You might die yourself, Hollveg.\" Lansing's voice was heavy with\nmenace.\n\n\"I might,\" Ollie agreed hotly. \"I might get murdered. And maybe the\nsame thing will happen to this supposedly sick man you want me to help\nout. He may not want to die any more than I do. I've heard you suicide\nsalesmen do a lot of murder-for-hire.\"\n\n\"You've heard too much, Hollveg.\"\n\nLansing took a plushlined metal case from an inside pocket and removed\nfrom it a filled syringe, complete with needle.\n\n\"This won't hurt,\" he said in a sneering imitation of a doctor. \"But\nit'll end your independence like a barbed wire fence.\"\n\nOllie began to sweat. \"I've heard of those zombie-shots too,\" he said.\nHe looked wildly around, then controlled himself and gestured almost\ncalmly toward the sky, land, and water visible through the cabin's\nplastic walls.\n\n\"Maybe you can put the needle away for a while,\" he suggested. \"I'm not\ngoing to walk out on you right now.\"\n\nLansing smiled and complied. \"You may keep your health a long time\nyet,\" he said urbanely. \"If you're sensible, we might even find steady\nwork for you.\"\n\nOllie suppressed a shudder.\n\nLansing tuned in a Western on the physeo. Soon the odor of sage and\nhorse-sweat filled the cabin.\n\nOllie watched avidly. He hadn't seen enough physeo to be bored with it.\n\nThere was a mouth watering camp supper scene, with pleasant odors of\nbroiling beef and burning wood; and a stirring moonlit love scene with\na wholesome girl who smelled of soap and starch, and only faintly of\ncosmetics.\n\nBut then came the climactic chase, a combined stampede, stage-coach\nrace, and Indian fight. So much alkali dust poured from the physeo that\nOllie got a fit of coughing.\n\nHe couldn't stop. After several excruciating minutes he lay down on the\nfloor and gasped to Lansing for a drink of water.\n\n\"There isn't any,\" Lansing told him sharply. \"And brother, you'd better\nget up from there, because you'll have to move fast when we get to\nFrisco.\"\n\nWithout knowing what would result, Ollie made sure he neither got up\nnor stopped coughing till they reached San Francisco which was fifteen\nminutes later.\n\nThe pretense involved intense effort for so old a man. His voice went.\nHe was clammy with sweat from head to foot. His face was pale and his\nhands cold.\n\nBy the time the copter reached the roof of San Francisco's Union Square\ntower, Ollie was actually unable to jump out of the cabin in the thirty\nseconds allotted by the remote traffic-control system. Lansing tried to\ncarry him out, but the result was merely a delay that damned the stream\nof traffic.\n\nA winged inspector buzzed them, took remote control of their copter,\nand led it to the emergency tower at Civic center.\n\nOllie was taken off on a stretcher. Lansing, his urbanity washed away\nin a flood of redfaced rage, was still in the copter when it rose.\nAnd the hypo was still in his pocket; with Ollie due to get medical\nattention, he hadn't been able to use it.\n\nOllie didn't dare stay long in the hospital. As soon as his stretcher\nwas set down on the receiving ward floor, he rolled out of it and with\nthe help of a fat steward struggled to his feet.\n\n\"Thanks,\" he whispered hoarsely. \"I have to go now.\"\n\n\"You can't!\" said the steward. \"You haven't even been examined yet.\"\n\n\"It's against my religion to have to do with medicine,\" Ollie\nimprovised. \"Besides, I'm perfectly well.\"\n\n\"Yeah? What about your voice--or lack of one?\"\n\n\"A coughing spell. I'm over it now. And my voice is coming back.\" It\nwas.\n\nThe steward unbuttoned his coat and scratched his belly meditatively.\n\"If you don't want treatment you don't have to have it,\" he said\nfinally. \"The joint's overcrowded now.\"\n\nOllie didn't congratulate himself when he got out. He was now a\nfugitive from both the geriatricians and the underworld. Soon the\npolice would want him for bail-jumping, and meanwhile they'd grab him\nfor vagrancy if they caught him off skidrow.\n\nHe headed that way at once, walking over to Mission and down it toward\nThird. A clock on a store-front said five twenty. He felt overdue for\nsupper and bed.\n\nHe counted his change--three dollars and forty-two cents. He had no\nbedroll; no overcoat, either. Even in this nice summer weather it might\nbe a little tough for a fellow to get by on the road with so little\nplunder. Eighty-six was a trifle old for the rugged life.\n\nWhat he needed, of course, was a white-collar job. Not only needed, but\ndeserved--he was a good clerk. Therefore he should go to the Hearst\nBuilding at Third and Market and scan the want ads posted there. As\nhe'd been doing when in San Francisco for forty years.\n\nHe thought of some of the many times he'd stared at that bulletin\nboard. He'd gone there often during the years he'd worked as a\nconstruction timekeeper, before that skill became obsolete. Then\nthere'd been an interval when he'd sold rebuilt window washers--for a\nfirm which still owed him money. And he'd haunted the board during the\nmonths he'd had that job in the automatic grocery, replenishing the\ndispensing machines' merchandise.\n\nNone of his jobs had come from a want ad. But he had to go look. It was\na ritual.\n\n\n\nThe years had made the ritual a hard one for him. He could read the\nfine-printed columns only with head cocked an arm's length away from a\ncheap reading glass held up to them. He took a lot of room; forced a\nwhite-capped young mechanic to peer awkwardly around him.\n\nEmbarrassed, Ollie moved out of the way. He'd begun to walk off when\nthe young fellow stopped him. \"I don't think you saw this one, Dad,\" he\nsaid, pointing.\n\n    OLDER MEN (the ad read) without dependents needed for dangerous\n    scientific experiments. If able to pass intensive physical and\n    mental tests report for interview to Civilian Personnel Office,\n    Short Air Force Base, Short, Utah.\n\n\"I don't know where the place is at all,\" Ollie complained wearily.\n\n\"Just this side of Salt Lake, on the main line,\" the young man said. \"I\nserved there, so I'm curious. If you're not--well--\" He shrugged and\nedged away.\n\n\"Thanks, son,\" Ollie called after him. \"I'm going to follow that up.\"\n\nThe young man walked on without looking back.\n\nOllie felt committed, not only by his offhand declaration, but by his\nritual. He'd come to look for a job; he'd found one for which he was\neligible; he must go after it.\n\nHe headed down Third Street toward the freight yards but stopped at a\nskidrow restaurant for a bowl of stew and a cup of coffee. Passing an\nold-fashioned catchpenny grocery he went in and bought a half-dozen\nrolls to take with him. The proprietor, squat, unshaven, and swarthy,\npicked out a large red apple and slipped it in with the rolls.\n\n\"Good for you,\" he said, smiling.\n\nOllie shook his head.\n\nThe grocer frowned, then replaced the apple with an orange. \"Easier on\nteeth,\" he said.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Ollie, smiling. \"You make me feel lucky. I'm\nanswering a want ad--maybe I'll get the job.\"\n\nThe grocer smiled vaguely. \"I hope.\" Then his face livened. \"What job?\nIn paper?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" There could be no other, for a man his age.\n\n\"It says 'dangerous,'\" said the grocer. \"I think maybe they cut you up,\nfind out how you live so long. Or make you sick to try new cure.\n\n\"You find better job--or Home. That one bad.\" There was a slight pause.\n\n\"Look. I close soon. You sweep store, I give you dollar.\"\n\n\"You're a good guy,\" said Ollie. \"But I've got three dollars now.\" He\nshowed them proudly. \"You save yours for somebody who doesn't have a\njob to try for.\"\n\nHe tucked the rolls and orange inside his shirt, marched valiantly out\nof the dark little store, and continued on to the yards.\n\nThe heavy traffic there confused him briefly. Transcontinental freight\nwas carried in long trains of rubber-tired cars towed on elevated\nbeamways by remotely-controlled, nuclear-fueled steam tractors. Here at\nthe San Francisco yards the trains were broken up and the individual\ncars hauled by turbo-tractor on city streets and suburban roads for\ndelivery at the addressees' doors.\n\nThe cars were huge, the noise and bustle awe-inspiring. Ollie stood\noutside the main exit watching the little tractors and big cars emerge,\ntill a beamway bull came over, flashed a badge, and told him to move on.\n\nHe did. He was a fugitive from so many things; he couldn't afford\nresentments.\n\nHe went on around the yards. They were vast. He felt sure that\nsomewhere there must be an unguarded entry, and set out to find it,\nmoving cautiously from shadow to shadow along the high plasti-board\nfence.\n\nTwice he blundered into watchmen. Once he nearly got himself run over.\nBut after a couple of hours he saw a bindlestiff slip through an\nunguarded gate, and in half a minute he was right behind the man.\n\nOllie moved away from him. There was safety in solitude. Besides, he\nhad to find a Salt Lake train.\n\nThe sealed cars were addressed like so many packages. But he had to\nhave light to read by, and he risked discovery every time he moved into\nthe light and took his stance behind the reading glass.\n\nThere were other hazards; television beams for the yard clerks to read\nnumbers by, invisible beams for the bulls to catch him with, headlights\nthat suddenly flashed on blindingly, humped cars rolling unattended on\nsilent, murderous tires.\n\nOllie felt like an ant on a busy sidewalk, liable to be crushed under\nfoot at any moment.\n\nBut an added hazard helped him find his train. The bulls had read that\nwant ad too. They were out in force around a string of cars. He slipped\nbetween two sleepy-looking men, checked an address, and then slipped\nout again, certain every car would be inspected before departure.\n\nA good way down the yard he hid at the base of the fence, dozing and\nshivering for several hours as he lay stretched out on the dew-chilled\nconcrete. He checked each outbound train as it went by, and again knew\nhis by the bulls on it.\n\nThey were on the cowcatcher and in the cab, on the car roofs, and in\nthe caboose with the train-crew of three trouble-shooting mechanics.\nHighlights gleamed on their weapons. Their job was to keep or get all\ntransients off that train--and they would if they could.\n\nOllie let most of the train go past. The caboose came by at about\nfifteen miles an hour with a sharp-eyed guard head-and-shoulders out of\nthe cupola. Ollie let him get past, too--and hoped he went on looking\ntoward the front.\n\nHe began to hobble parallel to the train, dismayed at the stiffness\nthat had set in while he lay out on the damp concrete.\n\nAs the rear of the caboose drew even with him he emerged from the\nshadows and dived for the coupling at the car's rear. He caught it\nclumsily, tore the nail off his left ring finger, but hung on.\n\nHe tried to trot but the train dragged him. He gave a leapfrog player's\njump and landed on top of his own hands, his thighs around the\ncoupling, his nose against the rear platform-wall of the caboose.\n\nThe engine jerked slack out of the long train and nearly dislodged him.\nOne at a time he moved his hands from the coupling to the base of the\nwall. He edged in a little closer. The train gathered speed.\n\nHe wasn't really on but he couldn't safely get off. He'd intended\nclimbing under the caboose to its rear truck, but the bulls and his own\nlack of agility made this impossible so now he must ride where he was,\nexposed to battering wind and searching cold as the train crossed the\nHigh Sierras, and also exposed to the whims of the trainmen if any\nshould come out on the platform and look down.\n\nHe'd seen men shot off trains. But he didn't worry about it. Instead,\nlike the old hand he was, he tried to sleep while clinging there.\n\n\n\nAt Sparks the train stopped for a maintenance check. The guards formed\na perimeter but Ollie was inside it. Too stiff to move far, he stayed\nin a shadow while the mechanics inspected, then he climbed under the\ncaboose and stretched out on a girder separating two tires of the\nrearmost, six-tired truck.\n\nThe tremendous tires fanned up hot winds when rolling, and these had\nwarmed the steel he lay on. Before the train started he ate a roll,\nsucked the orange, and stretched out face down for the speed run across\nthe central Nevada flatlands.\n\nThe guards stayed behind. After the train had started, one of them\nshined a light directly in Ollie's eyes.\n\nThe train kept on. And he was too close to the tires to be shot at;\nrubber-coated death whirled within three inches at either side of him.\n\nAs the train picked up speed he was careful to lie still, but beyond\nmaking sure he didn't touch the tires Ollie tried to put all thought of\nrisk from his mind.\n\nHe saw a sudden vivid picture of his dead wife and son as they'd looked\nbefore the undertaker fixed them. They'd been killed while travelling.\nIn times when to succeed was to get somewhere, they'd been killed en\nroute. He couldn't remember where to.\n\nThey'd died in a head-on crash caused by a stranger's error in\njudgment. A thing that didn't happen any more, now that highway\nvehicles were controlled by beamed energy instead of individual drivers.\n\nThe highway was one place where the human had been tested against\nthe machine and found inferior. The office was another. If Minna and\nCharlie hadn't died so long ago, they might have lived to see him\nnow--a bindlestiff so low he even lacked a bindle.\n\nStill, it was lonely with no one in the whole wide world to care\nwhether he lived or died.\n\nHe sighed, shifted his position, and was nearly jerked under the wheels\nby sudden contact with the tire on his right.\n\nIt was over in an instant. The tire simply ripped the coat from his\nback.\n\nHe still wore the sleeves. The rest was gone. Weathered thread had\nsaved him.\n\n\n\nHe had ample time to think about the irony of that before rosy\ndawnlight was reflected into his face from a glittering salt-pan. He\nknew then he was still west of Salt Lake City, and that Short Air Force\nBase was close.\n\nAlso close, now that night had withdrawn its concealment, was\ndiscovery. He was sure to be found when next the train stopped.\n\nTherefore he eased himself out of his coatsleeves. He moved gingerly,\nbut still chanced death to improve his appearance.\n\nThe train slowed, stopped.\n\nSomeone called, \"Here he is,\" and a redhaired Air Policeman leaned\nunder the caboose, looked him over, and said, \"Come on out, Pop.\"\n\nOllie's legs were stiff. The airman had to help.\n\n\"You're in kind of rough shape,\" he said. \"Where did you think you were\ngoing?\"\n\n\"Why--uh--east.\" Ollie cast down his eyes, ashamed even to admit he'd\nonce entertained the notion he might get a job.\n\nThe airman wasn't fooled. \"You slipped through the train guards after\nthe job we've got here. Didn't you, Pop?\"\n\n\"All I want is out,\" said Ollie stubbornly.\n\n\"Well,\" said the airman, \"you can't get off the Base without a pass.\nYou'll have to go up to Civilian Personnel and get one.\"\n\n\"Can't I wash first?\"\n\nHe could. He could also get a jeep ride to the terra-cotta headquarters\nbuilding, with a stop along the way for a canteen-cup of coffee and a\nslice of bread.\n\nWhen they got to headquarters the airman asked, \"Tell the truth, now;\ndidn't you really come after this job?\"\n\nOllie wouldn't admit he'd lied about it, so he lied again.\n\n\"I've seen some of the other guys come in after it,\" the airman\ninsisted, \"and you look as good as any of them. Why not try for it, now\nyou're here?\"\n\nHe gave Ollie a long application to fill out and left him at a desk\njust outside the personnel office.\n\nFrom somewhere came the clatter of a facsimile-printer, carrying the\nday's message from GHQ. A boy whistled above the squawk of a superwave\nradio. But otherwise the place seemed deserted at that early-morning\nhour.\n\nFor lack of anything better to do, Ollie filled out the application,\nleaving the job title blank. The only thing that gave him pause, aside\nfrom the difficulty of seeing, was his arrest record, and in time he\ndecided to put it down just as it was, including the pending assault\ncharge with its implication of jumped bail.\n\nAfter an hour a young captain entered the building and went to the\noffice marked Adjutant. A fat major gave Ollie a piercing glance and\nthen entered the Civilian Personnel office. At about five minutes of\neight the place suddenly boiled with military and civilian people of\nall ages and both sexes.\n\nThings quieted promptly at eight. A blond youth came out of the office,\nglanced at Ollie's application form, kept it, and invited him inside.\n\n\"First thing for you,\" he said, \"will be a physical exam.\"\n\nHe took Ollie to another room and turned him over to a young medic\nwho put him in a box like a steam cabinet, attached electrodes to his\ntemples, wrists, ankles, and chest, and put a helmet on his head.\n\nFor five minutes Ollie stood encased, his stomach fluttering as he\nrecalled the grocer's warning. He waited for the vivisection to begin.\n\nIt didn't. He was removed from his shell and handed an inked graph.\n\n\"Here's your profile,\" the medic said. \"It's good, considering. Take it\nback to the fellow who brought you here.\"\n\nHe did and was ushered into a glassed-in office containing two desks,\neach labelled Civilian Personnel Officer. At one sat the fat major. At\nthe other, a tallish young civilian held Ollie's application.\n\n\"My name is Katt,\" the civilian said, getting up to shake hands. \"This\nis Major Brownwight.\"\n\nThe major also shook his hand. Katt placed a straightbacked chair\nbetween the two desks, and invited Ollie to sit in it. Ollie did,\ngazing uncertainly from one man to the other.\n\n\"We heard you arrived by train early this morning,\" Katt said.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You were first reported in Sparks, but I'll bet you boarded that train\nin San Francisco.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. What's the penalty?\"\n\n\"None. I like it. It's enterprising, athletic, and even brave for a man\nof your years to do that for a job. Shows resourcefulness. Also skill,\nbecause men are trying to nip rides here from all over the United\nStates, but very few arrive.\"\n\n\"They're too old,\" said Major Brownwight. He turned to Katt and added,\n\"I still don't think it's an old man's job!\"\n\n\"Well sir,\" said Katt, stifling a sigh, \"your predecessor understood\nand approved of it. These old-timers have a lower metabolic rate\nthan younger people, with all that that implies. They don't mind the\nenforced inactivity, they won't use up so much oxygen nor need so much\nfood, they won't spend so many hours in sleep. All qualities we need.\"\n\n\"Maybe so.\" The major turned to Ollie and said, \"I just transferred in\nhere. You know more about this than I do.\"\n\n\"I don't even know what you're talking about,\" Ollie told him.\n\n\"Without divulging classified information,\" said Katt, \"for which you\nare not yet cleared, I can tell you these are little one-man jobs.\nSmall stuff--for pioneering. That's why we want you men with lots of\npatience, who're used to being alone. People without a fixed place in\nsociety, and not too much to leave behind. A husky old itinerant like\nyou is just what we want.\"\n\n\"For what?\" Ollie insisted.\n\n\"To travel--as a sort of working passenger, since piloting will of\ncourse be mechanical--in the first manned spaceships to leave Earth for\nthe stars.\"\n\n\"Spaceships?\"\n\n\"Sure. Solo spaceships. Super-fast, which means the trip will\nseem relatively short while you're on it, and will give you extra\nearth-years of life in the end.\n\n\"The job is much easier and less hazardous than the train ride that\nbrought you here. You're a natural for it. You really fit it.\"\n\n\"Do I, now?\" A quick glow of inner warmth melted many bad years away.\nOllie grinned.\n\n\"You know,\" he said, \"in a way that's a disappointment.\"\n\n\"How so?\" asked the major aggressively. \"Don't you want the job?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I want it. But all these years I've been telling myself that\nsomewhere on this earth was a place I'd fit into, if only I could find\nit. Now you tell me I fit in, but the place isn't here on Earth after\nall!\"\n\n\"Not right now, no,\" said Katt. \"But you'll be back. Rich and famous,\ntoo. No Home for you, Mr. Hollveg--you'll have a nice place of your\nown.\"\n\nAnd he did--after photographing the planets of Arcturus.",
