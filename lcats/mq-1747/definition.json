    "body": "It is a truism that a human being can get used to very nearly\neverything. The hardy Eskimo, lying belly-down on a plain of ice that\nstretched unbroken to the sky, probably spent little of his time in\nmeditating upon the vastness and inscrutability of the Universe ... he\nwas thinking of his dinner. And Charles Samson, seven hundred years\nlater, looked past his long nose at a scene of equal majesty--our\ngalaxy, viewed from a ship in mid-arc--in a similar frame of mind.\n\nIt was approximately sixteen hours, galactic time; a trifle later\naccording to Samson's stomach. He had played a vicious game of handball\nwith his wife an hour and a half before, and now he was hungry.\n\nThe Eskimo, although a patient man, might have reflected that it was\nunreasonable of this particular seal to wake up and look around him at\nthis precise moment. Samson, equally virtuous, told himself that his\nwife might have chosen a more opportune time to experiment with her\ncookery. Midge had conceived an idea for a souffl\u00e9 such as had never\nbefore been seen by Man, and had accordingly been adding new circuits\nto the autochef for the past eighty-five minutes.\n\nIf she ran to form, the souffl\u00e9--which would be a triumph, in spite of\nseventeen separate miscalculations--would be served in about twenty\nminutes more. Samson would have preferred an artless slab of steak\n_now_.\n\nThese, it may be considered, were picayune thoughts to occupy a brain\nwhich had been interminably trained and tested, stocked with a fabulous\nassortment of knowledge, and then sent out, with one other human mind\nfor company, to patrol a hegemony ten billion times as vast as Caesar's.\n\nAt the moment, however, there was nothing world-shaking for it to do.\nCharles and Midge, like a thousand other teams of trouble-shooters\nassigned to the volume of space known as Slice 103, earned their pay by\nintense, difficult, and sometimes dangerous labor which averaged three\nmonths out of the year; the rest of their time was spent in traveling\nfrom one assignment to the next, or simply in drifting, waiting for\nsomething of importance to turn up.\n\nTwo days ago, for example, they had been halfway along a leisurely arc\nbetween the Hilkert system and the observatory settlement on de Broglie\nII, when Slice H.Q. had buzzed them and told them to change course\nfor Kenilworth IV--an isolated and obscure one-man post out on the\nperimeter of the Slice. Tomorrow, as likely as not, another message\nwould inform them that the trouble, whatever it was, had simmered\ndown. Then they would blast into a new arc, and it would be six days,\nat least--even if another wild-goose chase did not intervene--before\nthey touched ground. Meanwhile, they amused themselves as well as they\ncould....\n\n\n\nAs for the stars, which lay spread out to the infinity beyond the\ninch-thick vitrin of the ship's veranda window, the trouble with them\nwas that they were always the same. Maugham records that when he first\nsaw the Taj Mahal, he felt an ineffable surprise and joy; but on the\nfollowing day, it was only a beautiful building. He had seen it before.\n\nSamson had been in space for something over half his lifetime.\nAccordingly, when the communicator bell rang, it shattered no\nmeditations on the relations of Man to Nature; on the contrary, Samson,\nuncoiling himself and walking through the doorway into the lounge,\ncarried with him the firm mental image of a ham sandwich, with relish\nand mustard.\n\n\"Let's hear it,\" he said.\n\nObediently, the communicator uncorked a quiet male voice: \"Harlow\ncalling the Samsons. Acknowledge if you're awake, will you? Over.\"\n\nMidge appeared at the opposite end of the room, brushing a strand\nof black hair back from her forehead. \"We read you, Harlow,\" said\nSamson. \"Go ahead. Over.\" The light-tube which encircled the ceiling,\nhaving turned pink at Harlow's \"Over,\" glowed spectrum-white again at\nSamson's, indicating that the communicator was ready to receive.\n\n\"Something?\" said Midge, coming forward.\n\nSamson waved his hand at her, palm down, in a gesture that meant \"Shut\nup and listen.\" Simultaneously, Harlow's voice began again: \"I'll give\nyou the story, anyhow; you can pick it up from the cube later if you're\nnot reading me now. Kids, this Kenilworth thing is a lot bigger than\nit looked two days ago. It may be even bigger than I think it is now,\nin which case we'll all have to start digging hidey-holes. It's all\nyours--I haven't got anybody else within two weeks' run of the place.\nSo listen.\"\n\nThere was a pause and a click, which Samson identified as the sound of\nHarlow's teeth gripping his ever-present pipe. Then, \"Here's the call\nI got from Jackson, the Kenilworth deputy. That was three days ago.\nI don't think there's anything in it that I missed, but I'll let you\ndecide that. It came in at three-oh-five hours G.T.\"\n\nA younger voice said excitedly, \"Jackson, Kenilworth IV, calling\nHarlow, Slice 103 H.Q. Urgent. Harlow, hold onto your hair. _The\nKassids are back._ Over to you.\"\n\nHarlow's recorded voice, sounding sleepy, answered: \"Better hold onto\nyours. Who are the Kassids, and what if they're back? I didn't even\nknow they were gone. Over.\"\n\n\"Who are the Kassids! Just the big medicine men of Slices 42, 43, 102\nand 103, is all! See your manual, page 9581 _et seq._ They landed on\nKenilFour ten days ago; I just got the message. It seems the local boys\ntold them about me as soon as they got past the language difficulty,\nand they're anxious to meet me. I'm going over there now--call you back\nin about six hours. Over.\"\n\n\"Give them a big, juicy kiss for me,\" said Harlow. \"Clearing.\"\n\nHis voice began again immediately: \"You can look up the Kassids in\nthe manual; I had to. They're a legend, a group of legends, fifteen\nthousand years old. At that point, my opinion was either that a gang of\nbackwoods Messiahs were passing themselves off as 'Kassids' in hopes of\ngain and glory, or else that some of Jackson's charges were playing a\nbig fat joke on him. So I rolled over and went back to sleep. The only\nthing is, Jackson never called back.\n\n\"I waited twenty-four hours and then alerted you. It still didn't look\nbig. Jackson might have crash-landed somewhere and broken his leg. Or\nhe might have got hold of some local antiquities and forgotten to eat,\nsleep, breathe or say his prayers. Nothing else happened until several\nhours ago. Then this came in, from an experimental organics outfit on\nLoblich VII.\"\n\n\n\nThe Samsons listened to a high, exasperated voice complaining that a\nmaniac named Jackson had landed at the station, 'preached a kind of a\nsermon,' and taken off again with seventeen of the group's twenty-two\nmembers. The group was now hopelessly undermanned; eight years' work\nwould be ruined unless H.Q. sent them trained replacements sooner than\nimmediately.\n\nHarlow demanded more information. What had Jackson's 'sermon' consisted\nof, exactly?\n\n\"He talked about Love,\" said the organics man irritably. \"And\nPeace--and a Message for the Universe. Stuff like that. If you ask me,\nthe man's insane. And if you want to know why three-quarters of this\noutfit dumped their work and walked out with him, don't ask me. When do\nwe get those replacements?\"\n\nThere was another pause, punctuated by the click of pipestem against\nteeth. \"Now that,\" said Harlow, \"began to seem a little smelly. If\nyou'll look at the tank, you'll see that Loblich is the nearest human\nsettlement to Kenilworth, and it's a long jump--Jackson must have\nblasted at maximum to get there in two and a half days. But from\nLoblich to any of three well-settled systems is just a hop.\n\n\"So I got the signal pattern of Jackson's ship out of the files and\nhad a warning broadcast to all the patrol centers in 103 and adjoining\nSlices. I also started a call going out to Jackson at twenty-minute\nintervals. He didn't answer it. That was all, until fifteen minutes ago.\n\n\"Jackson turned up in a landing orbit around Xavier III. The local\npatrol put a beam on him and warned him not to land. But instead of\nshunting into a parking orbit and waiting for instructions, as he was\ntold, Jackson headed for open space under full drive.\n\n\"The patrol burned him out of the sky. There was nothing left to pick\nup.\"\n\nThis time the pause was longer. \"If he had landed,\" Harlow's tired\nvoice said finally, \"and if he'd got anything like the same percentage\nof response in a larger group, this thing would already be too big to\nstop. I tell myself that.\" The Samsons could hear his teeth grating\nagainst the pipestem. \"All right, that's all I can give you,\" he said\nafter a moment. \"Land on KenilFour, get in touch with these Kassids,\ntalk to them and find out what this is all about and how they do it.\nI've got two cruisers and a battleship on the way from the naval\nstation in Kleinmuller, and if it turns out that they'll do any\ngood, they'll be there in fifteen days. But we've got to have more\ninformation. And just incidentally, don't let them sell you whatever\nthey sold Jackson. If you do, I can't offer you any guarantee you won't\nend up the way he did.\" There was a thump, and then a gargling noise\nthat meant Harlow was sucking on an empty pipe. \"Take every precaution\nyou can think of,\" he finished. \"Keep in continuous touch after you\nland. Over.\"\n\n\"Check, Papa,\" said Samson. \"Clearing.\"\n\nSamson, who was tall, beefy and blond, looked at Midge, dark and\napparently fragile, who was curled into a very small ball among the\ncushions on the other side of the room. \"Did you know Jackson?\" he\nasked.\n\nShe nodded soberly. \"A very good boy,\" she said.\n\n\"M-hm. You got that manual?\"\n\n\"Here.\" She put the cube into the reader set into the table in front\nof her, and began scanning for page 9581. Samson walked over and sat\nbeside her.\n\nThere was a good deal about the Kassids, also known as the Akassa, the\nKsits, the Karsis, the Krassit, the Karss and the Krathis. All the\nolder races in this section of the galaxy had legends about them. It\nwas not particularly surprising that Harlow had had to look them up;\nthey were just one item among the tangled mass of folk-legend and myth\nthat had been gleaned from a thousand inhabited worlds.\n\n\n\nNobody, said the manual, knew whether the Kassids had been a historic\nculture or a widespread myth. They were magicians, or demigods, or, as\nJackson had put it, big medicine men; they were purer and nobler than\nanybody else, they knew more about everything, they could change their\nshapes at will, et cetera. The fact that more than five hundred planets\nhad the same or similar legends proved nothing, because all the races\nin question, dull as they were, had had limited interstellar travel\nmillenia before the arrival of Man. Most of the legends agreed that the\nKassids had gone away, amid weeping and wailing from the lesser tribes,\nsome fifteen thousand years ago.\n\nBut now they were back--and something they had done to Jackson had made\nhim leave his post, and caused seventeen other people to leave theirs,\nand had got them all killed.\n\n\"I won't say I like it much,\" Midge said. \"How are you fixed for ideas?\"\n\n\"Information first,\" said Samson didactically; \"ideas after.\" He added,\nnot to Midge, \"Take a message.\"\n\nThe light-tube glowed pink.\n\n\"Charles Samson to Head Librarian, Lubyanka Central Archives. Urgent.\nRequest all available material on the Kassids, K-A-S-S-I-D-S. Don't\ndigest it--put it straight through on facsimile. Over to you.\"\n\nHe clipped a fresh cube into the receiver in the center of the room.\nAfter twenty minutes, a female voice said, \"Information coming through.\nOver.\" The recording light glowed; Samson turned on the reader and\nglanced at the page of type that appeared on the screen. \"I read you.\nThanks. Clearing.\"\n\n\"Coffee, chef,\" said Midge resignedly. \"And two ham sandwiches.\" She\ncame over and sat beside Samson. \"Hold that page till I finish it.\"\n\nSamson was a man with an open mind, a faculty which served him well in\ndealing with the weird and wild inhabitants of many planets in Slice\n103, but which, it occurred to him, was not just the thing wanted for\nthe task in hand. He kept his misgivings to himself, however, and aided\nby numerous steaming pots of coffee served up by the ship's autochef,\nbored his way determinedly through the twenty tubes of surmise,\nconjecture and hearsay provided by Lubyanka Archives. Midge, who had\na female-superiority complex, sat and took it alongside him, cube for\ncube.\n\n\n\nWhen they had finished, as Midge took the trouble to remind him, they\nhad learned next to nothing that wasn't in the Slice 103 manual. \"A\ntotal loss, wasn't it?\" she demanded.\n\n\"Sure. Just a precaution; there _might_ have been something in there\nthat the manual skipped. If it doesn't rain one Sunday, do you give up\nwearing waterproofs?\"\n\nMidge's expression indicated that the question deserved no answer.\n\"You've had your information--_now_ have you got any ideas?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Samson reflectively, \"Harlow seems to think there's some\nkind of compulsion involved, maybe hypnotic. I don't see how we can\nexclude the possibility, even though that kind of contact between alien\nminds is supposed to be impossible. But I've got a hunch that's not it.\nI think maybe they simply talked to Jackson--they _convinced_ him--and\nhe did the same to the seventeen that followed him.\"\n\n\"In my own fumbling way,\" said Midge, \"I got that far three hours ago.\nBecause if it was compulsion of any kind, why did it only work on\nseventeen out of twenty-two? I even made a stab at answering another\nlittle technical question--why didn't Jackson use the communicator?\"\n\n\"That's easy enough,\" said Samson. \"If you got a call from somebody\nyou didn't know, and he started spouting pseudo-religious propaganda\nat you, would you listen quietly until he was finished, or would you\ncut him off and complain to the Privacy Commission? And if he'd called\nanybody who knew him--you or Harlow, for example--we would have smelled\nsomething. Jackson might have found himself cut off before he ever left\nKenilworth, if he'd tried that. He couldn't take the chance.\"\n\n\"But if you don't mind,\" Midge said coolly, \"what I meant by my\nquestion was, have you got any ideas about what we're going to do?\"\n\n\"Sure. I'll go in there doped to the eyebrows. I'll use--\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said Midge. \"Please. You said, 'I'll go in?'\"\n\n\"That's right. I go in; you stay in the ship and watch. You also\nlisten, but through a whisper mike--you'll hear everything I say but\nnot what the other fellow says. In other words, I go over the cliff,\nyou hold my legs. Catch on?\"\n\nMidge said nothing.\n\n\"As I was saying, I'll use antihypnotics, and you might as well give me\na good dose of countersuggestion, too, but those are just playing it\nsafe. What I'm counting on to do the stunt is arnophrene.\"\n\n\"Arnophrene!\" Midge stared at him.\n\n\"Sure. In heavy dosage, the stuff inhibits your ability to add two and\ntwo. You can follow an argument, in pieces, and even make reasonably\nintelligent replies, but you can't hang onto it long enough to put it\nall together. In other words, if they convince me of anything, it'll\nbe on the order of 'Your nose is on the front of your face'... I'll be\nsick as a dog afterwards, of course, and I may not remember much of\nwhat they feed me. But you can hold my head, and drag the information\nout of me under hypno if you have to. Remember to be careful what you\nask for, in that case--we want to know who these people are and what\nthey're up to, not what they think about the Great Spirit.\"\n\nMidge kept looking at him somberly. \"I don't like it,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't like it either. Neither will Harlow, if he has to get me\nburned down for trying to save souls ... although, come to think of\nit, I can think of ways to play it smarter than Jackson did. Make a\nphony report, duck out somewhere along the line between here and\nH.Q., and then find me a nice uninhabited planet to hide on for a\nwhile. Pirate another ship later, maybe; wear a false beard.\" He\nsighed. \"But, come to think of it again, I guess all that has occurred\nto Harlow, too.\"\n\nHe looked at Midge. \"What'll you do if I should get sold before you can\nyank me out of there?\"\n\nHer eyes were steadier than her husband's. \"Follow you down and buy\nmyself a tambourine,\" she said. \"What did you think?\"\n\n\n\nMidge's small hands were painfully tight on the edge of the control\npanel. On the screen before her, reproduced with excellent fidelity in\nspite of the transmitter's peanut size, appeared whatever Samson was\nseeing: at the moment, the interior of a bronze-green room and two of\nthe roly-poly, stumpy-legged tentacled autochthons of Kenilworth IV.\nShe could see Samson's hands, whenever he happened to raise them; she\ncould not see his face.\n\nOn a smaller screen to the left was a view from a pickup in the\nship's hull--a grassy plain, seen from above, with a huge, black,\nlozenge-shaped spaceship and a cluster of the little KenilFour air-cars.\n\nSamson's voice remarked, \"They say the Kassid is coming now.\"\n\nMidge wanted to say something encouraging and affectionate, but her\nvoice stuck in her throat.\n\nAfter a moment, a doorway dilated at the end of the pictured room and\nsomething hopped in. For the benefit of the listening Harlow at H.Q.,\nMidge began to describe it. \"About a meter and a half tall--must be an\noxygen breather, I can't see any mask--it's a uniped. Moves partly by\nhopping, partly by contracting its foot. Rather thick trunk and four\nlimbs besides the foot, two at the very top, two where the trunk joins\nthe leg. A lot of flabby fingers, can't tell how many. Three eyes in a\nhorizontal line, vertical mouth under them. No clothes. Whole thing a\ndull tan color, with dark pa--\"\n\nShe broke off, as Samson began to speak. He was evidently replying to\nthe Kassid's speech of welcome. \"I'm very happy to be here. My people\nhave heard great things of you from your pupil, David Jackson.\"\n\nAnother long pause, during which Midge said, \"Dark patches, apparently\nat random--no pattern. I would guess the thing to be recently evolved\nfrom an undersea stage, tail altered to a foot. Don't know whether\nthere are any exterior organs on the other side--there, it turned\naround for a minute. No organs. Now the KenilFours are leaving....\"\n\nSamson said, \"That's why I came.\"\n\nAnother pause, and then, \"Yes, thank you.\" Something that ran on a\ngreat many thin, twinkling legs brought in a low stool and ran out\nagain. The interview went on, a meaningless sequence of short questions\nand comments by Samson, each followed by a long silence. \"Yes, of\ncourse, that's true.\" ... \"I see\" ... \"How clear that is now\" ... \"But\nin the case of war\" ... After a while, Samson's speech began to grow a\nlittle thick. He stumbled over occasional words, but always recovered.\n\nAfter a long time, Samson said, \"The word will be spread. My government\nwill want to know about your needs and your history, so that we can\nreceive you properly. Will you show me through your ship, and tell\nme something about yourselves?\" The view turned toward the doorway,\napproached it and went through into a long corridor.\n\nMidge closed the sending circuit between herself and Samson. \"Charlie,\nare you all right?\" she whispered. If he was acting, she told herself\nmiserably, it was a magnificent performance. Under the fuzziness of his\nspeech was something else ... an awe, a quiet joy.\n\n\"All right, Midge,\" said Samson's voice quietly, naturally. \"Don't\nworry.\"\n\nA long succession of rooms: control chamber, power plant, a garden with\nplants unlike any that Midge had seen before, star charts, transparent\ntanks full of murky fluid ... Samson's hand, and a narrow strip of\nsomething being put into it. Patterns of dots on the strip. Samson's\nvoice: \"What does it mean?\" Then more corridors, more rooms. Finally\nSamson's voice again, weak and hollow. \"Feeling rocky, Midge. Coming\nout.\"\n\n\n\nIt was Harlow's voice asking, \"How is he now?\" The \"now\" was an irony,\nsince even at second-order speeds, his voice had taken fourteen minutes\nto reach them, and he would not hear the answer for another fourteen.\n\nSamson, in orange pajamas, very pale, said, \"Ready to talk, Papa.\" He\nlooked at the ceiling. \"Don't think I need the hypno. I can remember\nmost of it. Fuzzy--a dreamlike quality to it--but I think it's almost\nall there.\"\n\n\"I've already had you under hypno,\" said Midge quietly. \"As soon as I\ngot you inside.\"\n\nSamson turned his head to look at her. \"So? What for?\"\n\n\"I wanted to find out if you'd had your soul saved.\"\n\nSamson grinned weakly. \"Is it likely? Harlow--get this. The Kassids\naren't invaders in the usual meaning of the term. They haven't got any\nmind-rays or insidious hypnotic powers, and they aren't interested in\ntaking over anybody's property. That's the first thing. Second, they're\nnot a race and they're not an empire. I saw at least twenty different\nlife-forms aboard their ship, and I learned enough to know that they\nwere all Kassids. That would seem to account for that business in the\nlegends about their being able to change forms. The local lads thought\nthe same thing about us at first, remember, on account of our having\ntwo sexes. Over to you.\"\n\n\"An interesting conundrum,\" Harlow commented, fourteen minutes later.\n\"They're neither a race nor an empire. What are they? Over.\"\n\n\"They're an idea,\" said Samson grimly. \"The idea is a pretty complex\none, and I don't think I got all of it, luckily. The effect of that\narnophrene, at a guess, was to drop my I.Q. about forty or fifty\npoints. But I can tell you what it is: it's a completely convincing\nargument--on the emotional _and_ logical levels--why you should never\nbreak the peace or stop loving your neighbor. If you're thinking that\nyou've heard arguments like that before, and we're still the same old\nrobbing, raping and fire-setting crew, you're wrong. _You haven't\nheard this one._ I'm telling you that I only got the fringe of it, and\nit made me want to bawl. Once you've heard it--_if_ you've got the\nintellect to take it completely--you'll never forget it for a minute,\nand you won't find any loopholes. You won't backslide, and you won't be\na Sunday believer. You'd sooner cut your throat.\"\n\n\"Over,\" added Midge quietly.\n\nSamson smiled at her and waited for Harlow's reply.\n\n\"I guess I believe you,\" said Harlow's voice when the time was up, \"but\nit would be hard to swallow if it hadn't been for Jackson. I want to\nask you two things. First, is there any question in your mind about\nwhat would happen to homo sap if this state of mind spread? Second,\nwhat do you think we can do about it? Over.\"\n\n\"One,\" said Samson promptly, \"no. Once you've heard the Word, and\nunderstood it, you _know_ there isn't anything more important than\nspreading it to other people. We would become Kassids--meaning that the\nWord would come before everything else--meaning in turn that we'd stop\nbeing the masterful mayflies who boss this half of the galaxy. We might\nnot even stay where we are. In fact, there would be a lot of changes,\nsome big, some small, but they would all add up to this: the human race\nas we know it would cease to exist ... and we can't have that, can we?\nThe universe may belong to the angels, but we're men. You can believe\nthat I'm not telling you this just to put your mind at rest about\nJackson. We've never had any serious opposition in the six hundred\nyears we've been spreading out, but this is it. These are the kids that\ncan finish us with one hand tied behind their backs.\"\n\nHe paused. \"It occurred to me a long time ago, when I was a student,\nthat if anything ever did fold us up, it wouldn't be a gang of monsters\nbreathing pure fluorine and squirting death rays from every tentacle,\nit would be an idea. You can kill monsters, but you can't kill an idea.\nFrom Genghis Khan to Hitler, not one of the real conquerors--the guys\nwho just wanted to grab everything in sight--hung onto a-half-credit's\nworth of what they got. But the Roman Empire was an idea; so was Islam,\nChristendom, Communism and Anticentrism.\n\n\"Two, I don't know what we can do about it. I'll tell you some things\nwe can't do. We can't make war on the Kassids. If we did, everything\nwe've got in this Slice, from shipyards to outhouses, would be buried\nunder crowds of howling neuters in about two seconds. I don't think we\ncan quarantine them, or ourselves, forever. There isn't anything they\nwant in the universe, except to spread the Word, so I don't see how we\ncould make any kind of a deal with them.\"\n\n\n\nHe took a deep breath. \"Let me tell you what else I found out, and\nmaybe something will occur to you. I said before that the idea is\ncomplicated. That's why ethics go up with intelligence, maybe. And\nthat's why the races we've met, that remember the Kassids, aren't\nKassids themselves. They're not bright enough. That explains something\nthat's had us wondering for the last six centuries--why there isn't a\nsingle race in our part of the galaxy that rates higher than a fairly\nbright twelve-year-old on our scale. There isn't any correlation\nbetween sexual reproduction and intelligence, as my wife and some\nothers would have you believe. It's simply that the others grasped\nthe idea--became Kassids. Eventually the Kassids had done all the\nproselytizing they could. That was roughly fifteen thousand years ago.\nEither they missed us altogether, or we weren't much better than an\nape's cousin at that stage; otherwise they made a clean sweep of the\ngalaxy. Do you know what happened then? Do you know where they went?\"\nHe paused for breath again. \"They went to the nearer Magellanic Cloud,\nand that's where they've been all this time. Some of the forms I saw\nare from there. The same thing happened--eventually they absorbed all\nthe intelligence there was. So they came back, hoping some had grown in\nthis galaxy--and they found us.\" He sighed. \"Over.\"\n\nHarlow's voice came back. \"Sounds stinking. Anything else?\"\n\n\"One more thing,\" Samson told him. \"This slip of plastic they handed\nme as a souvenir. They gave me a verbal translation, and I remember\nit word for word. It's a dictionary entry: '_Man, noun. A pentagonal,\ndipolar, monoplane dominant of intelligence 96_'--that's on their scale\nwith the average Kassid race at 100--'_native of District so-and-so_.'\nThe significance of it, from their point of view, is the '96.' It's\nthe first time they've been able to make an entry over 75 in the last\ntwelve or fourteen hundred years.\"\n\nHe frowned. \"When I first got back and Midge neutralized the drugs, I\nthought of it, and it seemed to me there might be an answer there. A\ndefinition describes the observer as well as the thing observed. That\nseemed like a brilliant thought to me at the time, but I can't see any\nhelp in it now.\" He blinked unhappily. \"All it seems to say is that\nthey've got a superficial and oversimplified system of classification,\nmeaning that physical structure isn't important to them--which we know\nalready ... my guess would be, incidentally, that the one who talked to\nme was picked because the Kassids thought I'd feel at home with it. It\nhad five extremities, although none of them was a head; it had a top\nand bottom and it faced in one direction. Ergo, it looked just like a\nman. Over.\"\n\nMidge said thoughtfully, \"It's funny. If they were so geometrical\nabout it, why didn't they say bisexual?\"\n\nSamson chortled. \"You _would_--\" he began, and stopped abruptly, with\na stricken expression. \"Wait a minute,\" he said. \"Cancel the over.\nEverybody shut up, even you, Harlow. The Midget has said something.\"\n\nMidge seemed to be trying to look indignant, pleased in spite of\nherself.\n\n\"Harlow, Midge,\" said Samson slowly after a time, \"there's one other\nthing about life in this universe that's been puzzling us for the\nlast six centuries. We know now that it has nothing to do with the\nintelligence level, but we still don't know why everybody else but us\nreproduces by simple division, budding, spores or conjugation--and in\nconsequence, lives a damn sight longer than we do, almost long enough\nto make up for their low native intelligence. But just suppose that\nEarth really is a freak planet--suppose that even the Kassids have\nnever run into a bisexual organism before. I didn't mention it to them,\nand I'm willing to bet Jackson didn't either. You know how tough it\nis to explain to a xeno--it generally takes ten days to convince them\nyou're not kidding. And, Harlow--suppose that I go down there again,\nand take Midge along....\"\n\n\n\nWhen they re-entered the ship, Harlow's voice was saying, \"Are you\nthere, Charles and Midge? Speak up, dammit. Over.\"\n\nThe Samsons looked at each other, glassy-eyed. \"With you in a minute,\nHarlow,\" Samson croaked, and lurched after Midge into the sick bay.\nBoth of them were full of arnophrene--Samson's second dose within two\nhours, and an extra-heavy one for Midge.\n\nThey staggered into the living chamber again, some time later, and\ncollapsed on opposite sides of the couch.\n\n\"Never again,\" said Midge faintly.\n\nSamson wet his lips. \"It worked, Papa. They swallowed it. I gave Midge\nenough of the stuff to make her about twice as disconnected as usual. I\nwalked in with a long face and told them that the change had started\nin my absence. They wanted to know what change. I pointed to Midge, and\nwe stripped for them. They may not be interested in shapes, but there\nwas enough difference there to make them take notice. They called a\nconference, and probed and poked and x-rayed us. I told them the story\nof the caterpillar and the butterfly. Or the nymph and the waterbug,\nI should say. You're the ugliest and dumbest member of this family,\nMidge.\"\n\nMidge made an inarticulate sound.\n\n\"I told them we're a two-stage organism,\" Samson said. \"One stage\nbuilds all the tall buildings, writes all the novels, does all the\nhigh-class thinking. The other stage reproduces. I said we have a\nforty-thousand-year cycle, half to each, but the first stage always\ntries to retard the metamorphosis, because the second stage is so\nstupid that it ruins our civilization every time, and we have to start\nfrom scratch. I said I was awfully sorry, but the change had come\nearlier than we expected this time, and there was nothing we could do\nabout it ... they're going off to the great nebula in Andromeda. Maybe\nthey'll find sixteen quintillion brainy races there, and they'll never\ncome back. The other way, at least we've got twenty thousand years to\nthink up another gag.\"\n\nHe sighed. \"All right, Papa. Over.\"\n\nFourteen slow minutes went by. Samson and his wife looked at each other\nand said nothing.\n\nThe Kassids had tried converting Midge, to see if she were as moronic\nas described. Midge had reacted properly, being so befuddled that she\ncould hardly work her way through a sentence; but she had heard a faint\necho of the Word.\n\nHarlow said, \"I don't know what to say to you, kids. You'll be\nremembered for this, both of you. A long time. History's been a dull\nsubject for the last few centuries, but this will liven it up. I don't\nthink anybody will hesitate to call it a major victory. Over.\"\n\nSamson smiled, bitterly and sadly.\n\n\"That depends,\" he said, \"on how you define 'victory'.\"",
