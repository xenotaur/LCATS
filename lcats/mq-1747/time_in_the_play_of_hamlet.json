    "body": "If it were not for the fact that we find conflicting opinions as to the\nforce and meaning of some one or more words or phrases in almost every\nscene of Shakespeare's dramas, and that--as to \"Hamlet\" in\nparticular--nearly every critic differs in many vital points from all\nothers of his army of co-laborers, it might be a matter of some surprise\nto see the great divergence of opinion as to the length of time covered\nby the action of this tragedy.\n\nOn the one side it has been seriously contended that its entire action\ntranspired within a period of not more than ten days; while on the other\nit has been thought to extend over at least ten years. Nay, more, there\nhave been those who, in eloquent phrase, have urged the view that\nShakespeare's method of dealing with the dramatic element of time is to\nartfully convey two opposite ideas of its flight--swiftness and\nslowness--so that by one series of allusions we receive the impression\nthat the action of the drama is driving on in hot haste, and that all\nthe events are compressed within a period of but a few days; while by\nanother series we are insensibly beguiled into the belief that they\nextend over months or years. \"So,\" say they, \"whenever time comes in as\nan element, we are subject to Shakespeare's glamour and gramarye--to his\nlegerdemain. We are held in a confusion and delusion about the time.\"\n\nThis theory is so pretty and striking--it harmonizes so nicely with our\nnatural love of mysticism and transcendental lore, and with the vague\nviews of those who fancy that they are diving into the depths of\nShakespeare when they do but skim the surface--that it is a pity that\nthe facts are all against it.\n\nNow, the truth is that our immortal poet has laid out the action of the\ndifferent scenes with minute consideration both of the time occupied by\neach and of the interval elapsing between them, when any occurs, and he\nhas so carefully indicated the lapse of time that he who runs may read,\nif he will but look as he runs. There is no conflict, no glamour;\nneither confusion nor delusion.\n\nHenry A. Clapp has recently shown this so clearly that it may seem a\nwork of supererogation to again discuss the matter. He, however,\nconsidered the general subject of the passage of time in all of\nShakespeare's plays, and, therefore, could devote but little space to\nthe one drama of \"Hamlet\"; hence, it seems possible that to his masterly\npresentation of the subject something may be added which will be of\ninterest to Shakespearean students.\n\nACT I., Scene i., of the tragedy of \"Hamlet\" opens at midnight and\ncontinues until dawn, and at its close, Marcellus, speaking of Hamlet,\nsays:\n\n    I this morning know\n    Where we shall find him most conveniently.\n\nIn Scene ii. Horatio says of the ghost:\n\n    My lord, I think I saw him yesternight,\n\nand Hamlet declares:\n\n    I'll watch to-night.\n    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve\n    I'll visit you.\n\nThis watch and its events are given in Scenes iv. and v., while the\nthird scene fills out the day, before the night comes on.\n\nBetween the first and second acts, one--and the principal one--of the\ntwo intervals in the play occurs; a lapse of time, as will hereafter be\nshown, of a little more than two months.\n\nIn ACT II., Scene i., Polonius says:\n\n    I will go seek the king.\n\nand in Scene ii. he enters the Audience Chamber and announces that he\nhas found\n\n    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.\n\nIn the same scene the players arrive, and Hamlet says of the play of\n\"The Murder of Gonzago:\"\n\n    We'll ha't to-morrow night.\n\nThis act, therefore, covers but one day, while the first scene of the\nnext act occurs on the following day, as is proven by the words of\nRosencranz in reference to the actors:\n\n              They have already order\n    This night to play before him.\n\nIn Scene ii. this mimic drama is given, and Scenes iii. and iv. occur\nthe same night, Hamlet's interview with his mother taking place, in\naccordance with the message brought to him, immediately after the\nbreaking up of the play:\n\n    She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.\n\nAct iv. commences with a continuation of the events of the same night,\nas is shown by Gertrude's words:\n\n    Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!\n\nwhile the king declares:\n\n    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,\n    But we will ship him hence.\n\nMorning has not dawned at the close of Scene iii., for among the last\nwords of the king is the declaration:\n\n    I'll have him hence to-night.\n\nBetween Scenes iii. and v. the second interval of the play occurs; a\nperiod, probably, of not less than two weeks, nor more than about a\nmonth.\n\nIn the last words of Scene v. the king says to Laertes:\n\n    I pray you go with me,\n\nand the conversation between them is concluded in Scene vii. In the same\nscene the letter from Hamlet is read, in which he writes:\n\n    To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes.\n\nOphelia's burial, in Act v., Scene i., takes place on the following day,\nfor the king says to Laertes:\n\n    Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech:\n\nand there is no reason for thinking the action of the final scene to be\ndelayed beyond the close of the same day, for in it Hamlet concludes his\nexplanations to Horatio, and is welcomed \"back to Denmark\" by Osric, who\nmust, therefore, then meet him for the first time since his return.\nMoreover, the words of the king in his last speech, in Scene i.,\n\n    We'll put the matter to the present push,\n\nindicate clearly that it was not his intention to allow any delay to\noccur.\n\nIt, therefore, appears that ACT I. represents the events of two nights\nand the intervening day, and that some interval of time then elapses.\nACT II., Scene i., to ACT IV., Scene iii., inclusive, covers two days\nand the night following the second day; and, after a second interval,\nthe events of two days are given in ACT IV., Scene v., and the remaining\nscenes of the play.\n\nIt now remains to determine the length of the two intervals.\n\nACT I. opens when the late king was\n\n    But two months dead; nay, not so much, not two;\n\nwhile in the third act the time since his death is stated to be \"twice\ntwo months.\" The interval is, therefore, two months, or a little more.\nDuring this time Hamlet, in pursuance of his studied plan,\n\n    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,\n    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,\n    Thence to a lightness, and by this declension\n\ninto his feigned madness. During this time Ophelia, in accordance with\nher father's commands,\n\n    Did repel his letters, and denied\n    His access to her.\n\nThat she had not spoken with him for some length of time is shown by her\nstatement that the presents given her by him she had\n\n    Longed long to re-deliver,\n\nand it was only on the day preceding the opening of ACT II. that Hamlet\nhad carried his feigned insanity so far as to force his way into her\ncloset and frighten her with his antics. It was at about this time also\nthat the king decided upon his \"hasty sending\" for Rosencranz and\nGuildenstern, that they, by associating with him, might learn the cause\nof his affliction. The ambassadors, whose departure for Norway is\nmentioned in the first act, are welcomed home again in the second, thus\ngiving us another evidence of the lapse of time. Still another\nindication of the length of the interval is contained in the fact that\nLamond, a gentleman of Normandy, reached the Danish court after Laertes'\ndeparture and \"two months\" before his return.\n\nIn the second interval there has been time enough for the news of the\ndeath of Polonius to reach Laertes in Paris, and for him, \"in secret,\"\nto return and spend some time in hiding, while he\n\n    Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,\n    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear\n    With pestilent speeches of his father's death:\n\nuntil at last he raises the body of men by whose aid he breaks through\nthe defences of the king and demands vengeance for the death of his\nfather. The interval had also been sufficient for Fortinbras to march\nfrom Denmark to Poland, win a victory there, and then return as far as\nthe Danish court on his way home. It was not sufficient, however, for\nRosencranz and Guildenstern to reach England, there to meet their\ndeaths, and for the news to be brought back from England to Denmark.\nAlthough Hamlet leaped upon the \"pirate\" ship when only two days out at\nsea, it is likely that a much greater time would elapse before his\nreturn. If it were only for appearances' sake, it would be necessary\nthat he should remain on the ship for some little length of time to keep\nup the pretence that it was a \"pirate\" that had attacked him, and in\norder that the fact might not become known that it was in reality one of\nthe vessels of Fortinbras that had rescued him in accordance with a plot\nagreed upon between the two princes. On his return he recognized the\nfact that the interim before the arrival of the news from England would\nbe but short, and that in this time, if ever, he must act. In truth he\nhad not an hour to spare, for the English ambassadors reached the Danish\ncourt only a few minutes after the death of the king.\n\nThe best clue to the length of the interval between Scenes iii. and iv.\nof the fourth act is, however, given by the flowers that were in bloom\nat each of the two periods.\n\nIn the last scene there are named pansies, columbines, daisies,\ncrowflowers, nettles and long-purples; flowers which in England (and it\nis the English rather than the Danish flora that is referred to by\nShakespeare) are all in bloom during the month of April. The time of\nPolonius's death is fixed with beautiful precision by the words of\nOphelia:\n\n    I would give you some violets, but they withered all when my father\n    died.\n\nIt is in March that the English violets bloom and pass away.\n\nThe early violets of the United States, the \"Johnny Jump-ups\" of the\nchildren, have a curious synchronism in their flowering, which\ndistinguishes them from other plants, and which seems to have passed\nunnoticed. Go at the right time, and you may find the grass beneath the\ntrees and in moist or shady spots fairly blue with unnumbered myriads of\nthese blossoms. Go two days later, and you may look in vain for a single\nspecimen. They wither, literally, in a day. This little phrase of\nShakespeare's shows the same peculiarity to be true of the English\nviolets; and yet Shakespeare is the only writer who has observed it.\nMany another poet would have made it the basis of a dozen similes, and\nwould have spun out verse after verse with varying references to it, yet\nShakespeare in his wealth makes but this unnoticed and incidental\nallusion to the fact, and refers to it no more forever.\n\nThe flowers that are mentioned, therefore, show that the tragedy ends in\nApril, and that it was some time during the month of March that Polonius\nwas slain. The action commenced some two months, or a little more,\nbefore that time, or during the first half of the month of January, a\ntime when\n\n    The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.\n\nAbout two months before this, or early in November, the treacherous\nClaudius stole upon his sleeping brother,\n\n    With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,\n    And in the porches of his ear did pour\n    The leperous distilment.\n\nAnd it was in December, or\n\n                Within a month--\n\n    A little month!\n\nafter her first husband's death that Gertrude married his murderer.\n\nWhy was it that for thirty days the perturbed spirit of the former king\nallowed\n\n    The royal bed of Denmark (to) be\n    A couch for luxury and damned incest,\n\nand made no sign?\n\nThe answer is given by Marcellus:\n\n        Ever 'gainst that season comes\n    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated\n    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;\n    And then, they say no spirit dare stir abroad.\n\nIt was, therefore, not until after the Christmas holidays were passed,\nthat the ghost of Hamlet's father could bring his message from the\ngrave.\n\nHere it may be well to notice a variation between the first quarto and\nthe following editions of Hamlet, the only one in which the time is\nchanged. In the first form of the play that has come down to us,\nGertrude's marriage did not occur until about two months after her first\nhusband's death, and the drama opens immediately after her wedding. The\nwinter's cold is but slightly referred to, and the season of the year\nseems not to have been as firmly fixed in Shakespeare's mind as it was\nby further thought and study.\n\nThere are two passages which seem to indicate warmer weather than is\nconsistent either with the \"bitter cold,\" which is twice referred to, or\nwith a January night. These are:\n\n    The morn, in russet mantle clad,\n    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastern hill\n\nand\n\n    The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,\n    And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire.\n\nThese I can only account for by the theory that they formed part of the\ndrama in an earlier state, before the time of the play had been fully\ndeveloped, and that their beauty saved them in the later forms that we\nnow have, notwithstanding their inconsistency with the \"bitter cold\" of\na winter's night.\n\nIt cannot escape attention that the first days of November would be very\nlate for the elder Hamlet to be able to continue his afternoon custom of\nsleeping within his orchard. Still, it is not impossible that pleasant\nautumn weather might continue until that season of the year.\n\nIt may be worthy of notice that the action in the original \"Hystorie of\nHamblet,\" on which the drama is founded, covers a period of \"many\nyears,\" and that in the German play, \"Fratricide Punished,\" which by\nsome is thought to be an adaptation of an early form of the drama which\nhas not otherwise reached us, there is not a single indication of any\ndefinite lapse of time or of the season of the year.\n\nIn the tragedy, as we now possess it, there are, as shown above, two or\nthree passages in which there is some apparent conflict with the\nremainder of the play, as to the season of the year in which the action\ntook place; but for any evidence of uncertainty as to the lapse of time;\nfor any legerdemain or glamour, the student will look in vain. On the\ncontrary, there are but few creations of the intellect in which the\npassage of time is as clearly and unmistakably indicated.\n\nAs for the various points that have been thought to show some confusion\nin the mind of our poet, there are none which upon careful examination\nwill not be found to have melted into air--thin air--leaving not a rack\nbehind.\n\nWhen Hamlet learned the truth of his suspicions, and resolved to obey\nhis father's entreaties for revenge, he needed the aid of a stronger\nmind, and felt the want of sympathy and counsel; but it is not\nremarkable that Horatio should have remained unnoticed about the court\nfor some two months after his arrival, during the time that Hamlet was\nfirst occupied in brooding over his father's death and his mother's\nshame; for then his melancholy filled his mind to the exclusion of all\nother thoughts, and he had not felt it necessary to take any immediate\naction. Polonius was surprised at Ophelia's account of the outbreak of\nHamlet, for it had but just occurred, and no such indication of violent\nmadness had preceded it; Hamlet's former state having been that of a\ngradual passage from sadness to fasting, sleeplessness, weakness and\nlightness, and his feigned insanity had but just reached a state which\nfrightened the king into sending for the former companions of the prince\nto keep him company.\n\nOphelia had longed for a considerable period to re-deliver Hamlet's\nremembrances, for, in accordance with her father's instructions, she had\ndenied him all access to her for some two months, and on the occasion\n(the day before she returned his gifts) when Hamlet, in fantastic\nattire, came suddenly before her, no word was spoken, and her surprise\nand agitation would naturally have prevented all thought of his\nremembrances.\n\nWhen Hamlet tells Rosencrantz and Guildenstern that he has \"of late\nforegone all custom of exercises,\" it is merely as an excuse for his\nloss of mirth, in order that they may not learn its true cause; but the\nfact was, as Hamlet confessed to Horatio, that since the time when\nLaertes went into France (that is to say, since the time when the ghost\nfirst appeared to him) he had been in continual practice with the foils.\n\nLaertes had been at home, \"in secret,\" for some little time before he\nforced his way into the presence of the king, gathering the populace to\nhis side and maturing his plans for rebellion. There is no reason to\nbelieve that he had failed to take time to go to his own home after\nreturning from France. On the contrary, Ophelia's words,\n\n    My brother shall know of it,\n\nindicate that even in her madness there remained in her mind a knowledge\nof her brother's presence near her. Laertes was surprised at her\ninsanity, for her mind had but just given way, and he, with the king and\nqueen, saw her first violent outbreak.\n\nIt seems strange that the King should propose a fencing match but a few\nhours after the burial of Ophelia, and that her brother should be\nwilling to engage in it; but the King's fear of Hamlet, and Laertes'\ndesire for revenge, were so great as to override all other\nconsiderations.\n\nThe discrepancy between Hamlet's apparent \"youth\" and the thirty years\nwhich are fixed as his age by the words of the grave-digger and of the\nplayer King, is the last point to which reference need be made; and,\nwithout stopping to discuss the subject here, it may be briefly said\nthat much of the apparent discrepancy disappears upon careful\nexamination, and that sufficient explanation may be found for the little\nthat may appear to remain.\n\nIn this, as in other cases, the truth is, that Shakespeare wrote with\nall care, and indulged in neither legerdemain nor clap-trap. We may\nsafely conclude that whenever faults appear to us to exist in his work,\nthey are much more likely to lie in our own carelessness and ignorance\nthan in any imperfection in the poet.\n\n\n\n\nCOMMUNICATION\nFROM\nJ. O. HALLIWELL-PHILLIPPS, Esq.\n\n\n\n\nCOMMUNICATION\n\n\nFrom J. O. Halliwell-Phillipps, F. R. S., F. S. A., Hon. M. R. S. L.,\nHon. M. R. I. A.: First Honorary Member of the Shakespeare Society of\nNew York.\n\n(Read in Society December 3rd, 1885, and ordered incorporated in the\nMinutes.)\n\n    Hollinbury Copse, Brighton, England, }\n                14th November, 1885.     }\n\n_Dear Mr. Appleton Morgan_,\n\nIt will, I fear, be too difficult for me to express, in adequate terms,\nmy appreciation of the compliment that the Shakespeare Society of New\nYork propose to bestow upon me. I take it as exceedingly kind of them so\nto notice an old bookworm, and let me hope that you will offer my\nresponsive acknowledgements.\n\nBut it occurs to me to submit to their notice a few memoranda on the\nhistory of the first Shakespeare Society that was ever formed, in the\nhope that they may prove of some little interest, especially as\nevidences that it is possible for Shakespearean research and criticism\nto be amicably and temperately conducted for a lengthened period, and\nthence presumably forever.\n\nThe Shakespeare Society of London was instituted in the year 1840, the\nthen leading members of the council being the director, Mr. Payne\nCollier; the secretary, Mr. F. G. Tomlins; the treasurer, Mr. Dilke,\ngrandfather of the present Sir Charles Dilke; Rev. William Harness;\nCharles Knight; Campbell, the poet; Macready, Alexander Dyce, Douglas\nJerrold, Sergeant Talfourd, Thomas Wright, and Young, the tragedian. To\nthese were added shortly afterward Bolton Corney, Charles Dickens, Henry\nHallam, J. R. Planche and Peter Cunningham, the last named taking the\nplace of Mr. Dilke as treasurer. Later acquisitions included Boyle\nBernard, Knight Bruce, John Forster, Rev. H. H. Milman and Sir George\nRose.\n\nThe society was especially fortunate in the selection of its director. A\nfluent speaker, courteous to all, ever in a good humor, always ready to\nencourage younger men in his favourite pursuits, and, withal, a good\nfinancier, Payne Collier was the beau ideal of the chairman of a\nliterary society.\n\nMr. Tomlins, a journalist and dramatic critic, made in every respect an\nexcellent secretary. Replete with good humor and fun, he frequently\nenlivened what might otherwise have been a somewhat too dull and\ntechnical meeting of the council; without allowing all this, I need\nscarcely add, to interfere with the legitimate duties of his office.\n\nMr. Cunningham--kind-hearted, genial Peter--was our excellent treasurer\nfrom nearly the commencement to the termination of our society. In\ncommon with most literary and scientific bodies, the power of government\nrested in an oligarchy, and I have specially mentioned these three\nnames, being those in whom the real control of the society was vested,\nhowever wisely they accepted the services or adopted the advices of\nothers. But there was, indeed, no one who desired to share in the\nabsolute responsibility of the management; least of all, no one who was\nfoolish enough to aim at the position of a supreme dictator. A few\nobservations from recollection of two or three of the other members of\nthe council may, perhaps, be admissible.\n\nMacready only attended occasionally, but one of his first steps (he\nbeing then the lessee of the Drury Lane Theater) was an announcement\nthat he had placed the names of every member of the council on the free\nlist of that establishment, made an indelible impression on my memory.\nIt was a delightful communication, money then being an exceedingly\nscarce commodity with me; and thus I was enabled to witness and study\nnearly every evening the best acting of the day, including the unrivaled\npersonification of _Imogen_ by Helen Faucit.\n\nAlexander Dyce was a frequent attendant. Although sometimes caustic in\nhis writings, he was the reverse at the council and in conversation, and\nthat he was personally one of the kindest and best hearted of men few\ncan vouch with more accuracy than myself, having enjoyed the advantage\nof his friendship from the days of my boyhood until his death in the\nyear 1869.\n\nPlanche, the most prolific English dramatist England has seen since the\ndays of Heywood, was also a frequent attendant. He was one of the most\namiable and genial of men, one whose genius and graceful humor have not\nas yet been adequately recognized.\n\nThere was not, in fact, a single member of the council in whom was\nembedded an element of discord in respect to the objects or management\nof the society, and having belonged to the council from the time of its\ninstitution in 1840, until its dissolution in 1853, I can bear\nsufficient testimony to the enduring harmony that prevailed.\n\nThe same kind feelings and good humor characterized the annual general\nmeetings, where, I verily believe, if an egotistical literary firebrand\nhad ventured to disturb the general concord--and no one else could have\nmanaged such an achievement--he would have been gently and courteously\nlynched. It is true that I am speaking of a primitive and unenlightened\nperiod, before it had been suggested that Shakespeare was somebody else:\nbut even the enunciation of so startling a theory as that would not, I\nam persuaded, have disturbed the serenity of a body who had perfect\nreliance on freedom of criticism, leading eventually to the victory of\ntruth.\n\nA similar catholicity of spirit--the absence of a specific platform--the\ntrenchant and spontaneous rejection, if I understand your scheme\nrightly, of nothing but offensive dogmatism and insolent\ncriticism--these are the elements that will commend the Shakespeare\nSociety of New York to every temperate student, and demand his earnest\nwishes for its influence and permanency.\n\nWith a reiteration of my grateful acknowledgments to your society for\ntheir kindness, and apologies for intruding upon them this little\nspecimen of an old man's garrulity, believe me, yours faithfully.\n\n  [Signed]      J.
