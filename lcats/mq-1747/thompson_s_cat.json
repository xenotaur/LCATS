Forgotten\nin the panic was Buster, Thompson's wise cat._]\n\n\n\"It's a dead world,\" Thompson spoke. There was awe in his voice, and in\nspite of his sure knowledge that nothing could happen to him or to his\ncrew here on this world, there was also somewhere inside of him the\ntrace of a beginning fear.\n\nStanding beside him on the rooftop of the building, Kurkil spoke in a\nwhisper, asking a question that had been better unasked. \"What killed\nit?\"\n\nThompson stirred fretfully. He hadn't wanted to hear this question, he\ndidn't want to hear it now. His gaze went automatically to the trim\nlines of the space cruiser resting quietly in the square below the\nbuilding. His spirits lifted at the sight. That was his ship, he was in\ncharge of this far-flung exploring expedition thrown out from Sol\nCluster to the fringes of the universe, thrown out by Earth-sired races\nbeginning their long exploration of the mysteries of space and of the\nworlds of space. There was pride in the sight of the ship and pride in\nthe thought of belonging to this space-ranging race. Then his gaze went\nover the deserted city radiating in all directions from them and he was\naware again of the touch of fear.\n\nResolutely he turned the feeling out of his mind, began seeking an\nanswer to Kurkil's question.\n\nThis place had been a city once. If you counted buildings and streets,\ntall structures where people might work quietly and effectively, broad\navenues leading out to trim homes where they might rest in peace after\ntheir labors of the day, if you counted these things as being important,\nit was still a city. But if you thought that the important element in\nthe make-up of a city was its inhabitants then this place no longer\ndeserved the name.\n\nIt had no inhabitants.\n\n\"I don't know what killed it,\" Thompson said. Before landing they had\ncircled this world. From the air they had seen more than a dozen cities\nsuch as this one. All of them dead, all of them deserted, all of them\nwith streets overgrown by shrubbery, the pavements buckling from the\nsimple pressure of roots pushing upward, the buildings falling away into\nruin for the same reason. But they had seen no inhabitants. They had\nseen the roads the inhabitants had built to connect their cities,\ndeserted now. They had seen the fields where these people had once\nworked, fields that now were turning back into forests. They had seen no\nevidence of landing fields for air craft or space ships. The race that\nhad built the cities had not yet learned the secret of wings.\n\nFrom the roof of the building where they stood, the only living\ncreatures to be seen were visible through the plastic viewport of the\nship below them--Grant, the communication specialist, and Buster, the\nship's cat.\n\nGrant had been left to guard the vessel. Buster had been required to\nremain within the ship, obviously against his will. He had wanted to\ncome with Thompson. A trace of a grin came to Thompson's face at the\nsight of the cat. He and Buster were firm mutual friends.\n\n\"I don't like this place,\" Kurkil spoke suddenly. \"We shouldn't have\nlanded here.\"\n\nKurkil paused, then his voice came again, stronger now, and with\novertones of fear in it. \"There's death here.\" He slapped at his arm,\nstared around him.\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"Something bit me.\" He showed the back of his hand. A tiny puncture was\nvisible.\n\n\"Some insect,\" Thompson said. The matter of an insect bite was of no\nconcern. Kurkil, and every other member of this expedition, were\ndisease-proof. Back in Sol Cluster vaccines and immunizing agents had\nbeen developed against every known or conceivable form of germ or virus.\nEach member of the crew had been carefully immunized. In addition, they\nhad been proofed against stress, against mounting neural pressure\nresulting from facing real or imaginary danger.\n\nBarring space collision or an accident on a world they were exploring,\nnothing could happen to them.\n\n\"We checked the air, took soil and vegetation samples, before we\nlanded,\" Thompson said. \"There is nothing here that is harmful to a\nhuman.\" There was comfort in the thought.\n\nKurkil brightened perceptibly. \"But, what happened to the race that\nbuilt this city?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Thompson answered. A tinge of gruffness crept into his\nvoice as he forced out of his mind the memories of what they had seen in\nthis building they had entered and had climbed. This had once been an\noffice building, a place where the unknown people who had worked here\nhad handled their business transactions and had kept their records. They\nhad seen no bookkeeping machines, none of the elaborate mechanical\ndevices used in Sol Cluster to record the pulse of commerce. This race\nhad not progressed that far. But they had left behind them books written\nin an unintelligible script, orders for merchandise still neatly\npigeonholed, all in good order with no sign of disturbance.\n\nThe workers might have left these offices yesterday, except for the\ncarpets of dust that covered everything.\n\n\"There isn't even any animal life left,\" Kurkil spoke.\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"But what happened? A race that has progressed to the city-building\nstage doesn't just get wiped out without leaving some indication of what\nhappened to them.\"\n\n\"Apparently they did just that.\"\n\n\"But it's not possible.\"\n\n\"It happened.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"There's Neff,\" Thompson spoke. Far down the avenue below them, three\nfigures had appeared, Neff, Fortune, and Ross. Neff tall and slender,\nFortune round like a ball, and Ross built square like a block of\nconcrete. Neff saw them on top of the building and beckoned to them.\nThere was urgency in the gesture.\n\n\"They've found something,\" Thompson said. With Kurkil following him he\nwent hastily out of the building.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Come and see,\" Neff answered. Neff's face was gray. Fortune and Ross\nwere silent.\n\nThe building in front of which they were standing had been a house once.\nThe architecture resembled nothing they had ever seen on Earth but the\npurpose of the structure was obvious. Here somebody had lived. Thompson\ntried to imagine people living here, the husband coming home in the\nevening to the dinner prepared by the wife, kids running to meet him.\nHis imagination failed.\n\n\"Back here,\" Neff said.\n\nThey went around what had been a house into what had been a garden of\nsome kind, a quiet nook where a family might sprawl in peace. \"There,\"\nNeff said pointing.\n\nThe three skeletons were huddled together in an alcove in front of what\nhad once been a shrine. They lay facing the shrine as if they had died\npraying. Above them in a niche in a wall was--\n\n\"An idol,\" Kurkil whispered.\n\n\"They died praying to their god,\" Thompson said. He was not aware that\nhe had spoken. Three skeletons....\n\nThe bones indicated a creature very similar to the human in structure. A\nlarge, a middle-sized, and a small skeleton.\n\n\"We think the small one is that of a child,\" Ross spoke. \"We think this\nwas a family.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Thompson said. \"Did you find other skeletons?\"\n\n\"Many others. We found them almost everywhere but usually tucked away in\ncorners, as if the people had tried to hide from something.\" His voice\nwent suddenly into uneasy silence.\n\n\"Any indication as to the cause of death?\"\n\n\"None. It apparently came on quite suddenly. We judge that the\ninhabitants had some warning. At least we do not seem to find enough\nskeletons for a city of this size, so we estimate that part of the\npopulation fled, or tried to.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Thompson repeated tonelessly. He caught a vague impression that\nsomething had passed before his eyes, like a darting flicker of light,\nand he caught, momentarily, a fast rustle in the air, as of souls\npassing. His mind was on the flight of this race, the mass hegira they\nhad attempted in an effort to escape from some menace. What menace?\n\"What do you think caused it?\"\n\nRoss shrugged, a gesture eloquent with a lack of knowledge and of\nunderstanding. \"War--\"\n\n\"No wars were fought on this planet,\" Neff spoke quickly. \"These cities\nshow no evidence of conflict.\"\n\n\"Um,\" Thompson said. The four men were looking uneasily at him. They\nwere waiting for him to make up his mind, to decide on a course of\naction.\n\nThompson did not like his own thinking. Something--the blood-brother of\ndeath--had been here on this planet, that much was certain. The evidence\nwas everywhere.\n\n\"We will return to the ship,\" Thompson said.\n\nGrant saw them coming, had the lock open for them. His worried face\nlooked out at them. \"What gives here?\"\n\n\"We don't know,\" Thompson answered. The cat, Buster, pushed forward\nbetween Grant's legs, took a long leap at Thompson's chest, made a\ntwenty-claw safe landing there. \"Hi, old fellow, were you worried about\nme?\"\n\nThey passed through the lock. \"Take her up,\" Thompson said. \"We need a\nlittle time to think about this enigma. Maybe we can think better when\nwe're not so close to it.\"\n\nAt his words, relief showed on the faces of the men. \"Maybe sometime\nsoon we'll be heading for home?\" Kurkil spoke, grinning hopefully.\n\n\"You can be certain of that,\" Thompson said.\n\n\n\nThe ship lifted, hung miles high in the air above the silent planet. The\ngroup considered the problem.\n\n\"I vote to make a complete investigation,\" Grant said. He was full of\neager enthusiasm. \"There was a race here. Something happened to it.\nWe've got to find out what happened because--\" He got no further. Slowly\nthe enthusiasm went from his face. \"No, that's not possible,\" he ended.\n\n\"There's no danger of the virus that destroyed this race crossing space\nto Sol Cluster,\" Kurkil spoke. \"The distance is too great.\"\n\n\"The distance wasn't too great for us to cross it,\" Fortune spoke.\n\n\"Please,\" Thompson interrupted. \"We can't use logic on this situation\nuntil we have adequate data. The only data we have--\" His voice trailed\noff into silence as his memory presented him with a facsimile of that\ndata--silent, deserted cities, a world going back to vegetation, three\nskeletons in front of a shrine.\n\nAbruptly he reached a decision. It was impulsive. \"Our tour of\nexploration is near an end anyhow. We're leaving. We're heading back to\nSol Cluster. We'll mark this planet on the star maps for further\nexploration.\"\n\nThe face of every man present brightened as he made the announcement.\nSol Cluster! Home! The green world of Earth across the depths of space.\nIn even the thought there was almost enough magic to wipe out the fear\nof what they'd seen back there on the deserted planet.\n\nLess than an hour later, the drone of the drivers picked up as the ship,\nalready set on course, began to accelerate in preparation for the jump\ninto hyper-flight. Thompson was in his cabin making a final check of the\nmachine-provided flight data. Buster was in his lap half-asleep.\nSuddenly the cat jumped from his lap and seemed to pounce on some\nelusive prey in the room. The cat caught what it was seeking, its jaws\ncrunched, it swallowed.\n\nThompson stared at the cat from disbelieving eyes. \"Buster, are you\ndreaming? Did you dream there was a mouse in here?\"\n\nThe cat meowed, came toward him, jumped again into his lap and went back\nto sleep. Thompson returned to his figures. They were correct.\n\nOver the ship's communication system came the soft throb of a gong. The\nwarning that the jump was coming. In his lap, Buster awakened, instantly\nsank twenty claws into Thompson's clothing. Thompson reached out and\ntook a firm grip on the hand holds on his desk, began to breathe deeply.\nThe gong sounded again. Final warning that the ship was going into\nhyper-flight. Thompson took as deep a breath as possible, held it.\n\nThe gong went into silence. The ship throbbed. The jump was in progress.\nThompson had the dazed impression that every atom in his body tried to\nturn over at once. For a moment, there was a feeling of intense strain.\nThen the feeling was gone as the ship and its contents passed into\nhyper-flight. Thompson began to breathe again. In his lap, Buster\nrelaxed his claw holds, began to purr. Buster was an old hand at taking\nthese jumps.\n\n\"EEEEEEyooow!\"\n\nThe eerie scream that came echoing through the ship seemed to lift up\nevery single strand of hair on Thompson's head. Thompson ran out of the\ncabin. The scream came again, from the lounge. Thompson entered the\nlounge just in time to see Kurkil standing in the middle of the room,\nrip the last remnant of clothing from his body. Revealed under the\nlights, his skin was turning a vivid green.\n\nFortune was trying to approach him. Kurkil was warning the man off.\n\n\"Stay away, stay away. Don't touch me. You'll get it.\"\n\nIn the split second that was needed for Thompson to take in the\nsituation, the green color flowing over Kurkil's body deepened in\nintensity.\n\nAs the color deepened, the screams bubbling on his lips began to die\naway. He fell slowly, like a man who is coming unhinged one joint at a\ntime.\n\nHe was dead before he hit the floor. Dead so completely that not even a\nconvulsive tremor passed through his body.\n\nA frozen silence held the lounge. For this was a dream, a nightmare,\nwild, distorted imagery.\n\nFortune's hand waved vaguely in the direction of Sol Cluster. \"It looks\nas if we're not as bug and stress proof as they said we were.\"\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"He was sitting there in the chair and I thought he was asleep. Then he\nwas screaming and tearing his clothes off.\" Ross spread his hands. \"I\ntried to help--\"\n\n\"I know,\" Thompson said. He was trying to decide what to do. This ship\npossessed no facilities for handling the dead. Such a contingency had\nbeen thought too remote for consideration. Well, there was the ejection\nport. \"Get sheets,\" Thompson said. With Fortune and Ross helping, he set\nabout doing what had to be done.\n\n\n\nLater, in the lounge, they met to decide what had to be done. Neff,\nleaving the drivers on automatic control, came up from the engine room.\nGrant came forward from the control room. If any danger presented\nitself, warning bells would call them back to their posts.\n\nThey were a silent and an uneasy group. Only Buster remained unaffected.\n\n\"There seems no doubt that we brought the infection back on board ship\nwith us,\" Thompson said.\n\nHe had stated the obvious. It got the answer it deserved. Silence.\n\n\"We also must consider the possibility that another of us, possibly all\nof us, are infected.\"\n\nNo man stirred, no man spoke. Apparently they hoped they had not heard\ncorrectly the words that had been spoken. In Thompson's lap Buster\ngrumbled as if he had understood and did not like what had been said.\n\n\"What are we going to do?\"\n\n\"How can we find out what's causing this disease?\"\n\nTwo voices came. Then came Fortune's voice. \"And even if we find out,\nwhat can we do about it? _They_ couldn't do anything about it.\"\n\n\"The fact that the race back there couldn't stop the disease, doesn't\nmean we can't stop it. We're a different race with a different\nmetabolism and a different body structure--\"\n\n\"Kurkil had the same metabolism and the same body structure,\" Ross said.\n\n\"We will do what we can,\" Thompson spoke flatly. In spite of the fact\nthat these men were supposed to be nerve proof, there was panic in the\nair. He could sense it, knew that it had to be stopped before it got\nstarted. Inwardly he cursed the fact that there was no doctor aboard,\nbut he knew only too well the line of reasoning that had led to the\nomission of a physician.\n\n\"We have a medical library,\" Ross said, tentatively.\n\n\"Yes,\" Fortune spoke. \"And it tells you exactly how to treat every\nconceivable form of accident but it doesn't say a single damned word\nabout infections, and if it did we don't have any medicine to treat\nthem.\n\nAgain silence fell. In Thompson's lap, Buster squirmed, dropped to the\nfloor. Tail extended, body low, he moved across the plastic floor as if\nhe were stalking something that lay beyond the open door. \"We'll\nfumigate anyhow,\" Thompson said. \"We'll scour the ship.\"\n\nThere was some relief in action. The clothing that had been worn by the\nlanding party went out through the ejection lock. Inside the ship, the\nfloors, walls, and ceilings were scoured by sweating men who worked\nfeverishly. Fumigants were spread in every room.\n\nWith the spreading of the fumigants, spirits began to rise, but even\nthen the signs of stress were still all too obvious. No one knew the\nincubation period of the virus. Hours only had been needed to bring\nKurkil to his death. But days might pass before the virus developed in\nits next victim.\n\nMonths or even years might pass before they were absolutely sure they\nwere free from any chance of infection.\n\nBy the time the ship reached Sol Cluster, and the automatic controls\nstopped its hyper-flight, they might all be dead.\n\nIf that happened, the ship's controls would automatically stop its\nflight. It would be picked up by the far-ranging screens of the space\npatrol, a ship would be sent out to board it and bring it in.\n\nAt the thought of what would happen then, Thompson went hastily forward\nto the control room. Grant, thin-lipped and nervous, was on duty there.\nThompson hastily began plotting a new course. Grant watched over his\nshoulder.\n\n\"Make this change,\" Thompson said.\n\n\"But, Captain--\" Grant protested. The man's face had gone utterly white\nas he realized the implications of this new course. \"No. We can't do\nthat. It'll mean--\"\n\n\"I know what it will mean. And I'm in my right mind, I hope. This course\nis a precaution, just in case nobody is left alive by the time we reach\nSol Cluster.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Make the change,\" Thompson ordered bluntly.\n\nReluctantly Grant fed the new course into the computers. A throb went\nthrough the vessel as the ship shifted in response.\n\n\"We'll come out of hyper-flight in less than three hours,\" Grant spoke.\n\"Heaven help us if this course is not changed before that time.\"\n\n\"If this course is not changed before that time, Heaven alone can help\nus. From now on, you're not to leave this control room for an instant.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nWith Buster following behind him, Thompson left the control room.\n\n\"Yoooow!\" The scream coming from the lounge this time was in a different\nkey and had a different sound. But the meaning was the same as it had\nbeen when Kurkil had screamed. Thompson went forward on the run.\n\nThe victim was Ross. Like Kurkil, he was tearing his clothes off. Like\nKurkil, he was turning green. When he went down, he did not rise again.\n\nAs he stood staring down at Ross, Thompson had the vague impression of\nwhirring wings passing near him. Whispering wings, as if a soul were\ntaking flight.\n\nFrom the engine room Neff appeared. \"I heard somebody scream over the\nintercom. Oh, I see.\" His face worked, his jaws moved as if he was\ntrying to speak. But no sound came.\n\nFortune emerged from his quarters to look down at Ross. \"Our fumigating\ndidn't work, huh?\"\n\n\"Maybe he caught the bug on the planet,\" Thompson said. He tried to put\nconviction into his voice. The effort failed. \"Get sheets,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThere was no prayer. There was no burial ceremony. The body went through\nthe ejection port and disappeared in the vast depths of space.\n\nThompson returned to his cabin, slumped down at his desk, Fortune and\nNeff following.\n\nBuster meowed. \"Okay, pal.\" The cat jumped into Thompson's lap.\n\n\"I guess there's not much point in trying to kid ourselves any longer,\"\nFortune said. His voice was dull and flat, without tone and without\nspirit. A muscle in Neff's cheek was twitching.\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" Thompson said.\n\n\"Hell, you understand me well enough. The facts are obvious. We've\neither all got the virus, or it's here in the ship, and we will get it.\nAll we're doing is waiting to see who goes next. What I want to know\nis--Who'll shove the last man through the ejection port?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Thompson answered.\n\n\"Isn't there anything else we can do?\" The tic in Neff's cheek was\nbecoming more pronounced.\n\n\"If there is, I don't know--What the hell, Buster?\" The cat which had\nbeen lying in his lap, suddenly leaped to the floor. Tail extended,\ncrouched, eyes alert, the cat seemed to be trying to follow the flight\nof something through the air above him.\n\nVery vaguely, very dimly, Thompson caught the rustle of wings.\n\nThe actions of the cat, and the sound, sent a wave of utter cold washing\nover his body.\n\nBefore he could move, the cat leaped upward, caught something in\nsnapping jaws.\n\nIn the same split second Thompson moved. Before Buster had had time to\nswallow, Thompson had caught him behind the jaws, forcing them shut. On\nhis desk was a bell jar. He lifted it, thrust the cat's head under it,\nforced his thumb and forefinger against the jaws of the cat.\n\nThe outraged Buster disgorged something. Thompson jerked the cat's head\nfrom under the jar, slammed down the rim. The angry cat snarled at him.\nNeff and Fortune were staring at him from eyes that indicated they\nthought he had lost his senses. Thompson paid them no attention. He was\ntoo busy watching something inside the bell jar even to notice that they\nexisted.\n\nHe could not see the creature under the jar.\n\nHe knew it could fly but he did not know its shape or size. He could\nhear it hitting the falls of the jar. And each time it hit the wall, a\ntiny greenish smudge appeared at the point of impact.\n\n\"What--what the hell have you got there?\" Neff whispered.\n\n\"I don't know for sure. But I think I've got the carrier of the virus.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Watch.\"\n\n\"I can't see anything.\"\n\n\"Nor can I yet, but I can hear it and I can see the places where it hits\nthe wall of the jar. There's something under the jar. Something that\nBuster has been seeing all along.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nThompson pointed at the jar. \"One or several of those things came into\nthe ship when the lock was open. We couldn't see them, didn't know they\nexisted. But Buster saw them. He caught one of them in this cabin soon\nafter we took off. I thought he was playing a game to amuse himself,\nor--\" He broke off. From the back of his mind came a fragment of\nhistory, now in the forgotten Dark Ages of Earth, whole populations had\nbeen ravaged and destroyed by a fever that was carried by some kind of\nan insect. Did they have some kind of an insect under his jar?\n\nHolding his breath, Thompson watched.\n\nThe pounding against the walls of the jar was growing weaker. Then it\nstopped. On the desk top, a smudge appeared. Wings quavered there, wings\nthat shifted through a range of rainbow colors as they became visible.\n\nAs the flutter of the wings stopped the whole creature became visible.\nMade up of some kind of exceedingly thin tissue that was hardly visible,\nit was about as big as a humming bird.\n\nSilence held the room. Thompson was aware of his eyes coming to focus on\nthe long pointed bill of the creature.\n\n\"Alive it was not visible at all,\" Fortune whispered. \"Dead, you can see\nit.\" His voice lifted, picked up overtones of terror. \"Say an hour or so\nago Ross was complaining that something had bit him.\"\n\nLike the last remnant of a picture puzzle fitting together, something\nclicked in Thompson's mind. \"And Kurkil. While we were out of the ship\nsomething bit him.\"\n\nSilence again. His eyes went from Neff to Fortune. \"Did--\"\n\nThey shook their heads.\n\n\"Then that ties up the package,\" Thompson whispered. \"This creature\ncarried the virus, or poison, or whatever it was. Without being bitten,\nthe virus cannot spread. We've found the cause. We've got it licked.\"\n\nHe was aware of sweat appearing on his face, the sweat of pure relief.\nHe sank back into his chair. Buster, recovering from his indignity at\nthe outrage he had suffered, jumped to the top of the desk, settled down\nwith his nose against the glass, watching the dead creature inside the\nbell jar.\n\n\"He caught one of those things right in this cabin,\" Thompson whispered.\nA shudder passed over him and was gone. He had been so close to death,\nand had not known it. Buster had saved him.\n\nInstead of seeking protection from him, the cat, in a sense, had been\nprotecting him. His gaze centered fondly on the cat.\n\n\"What if there are more of those things in the ship?\" Fortune spoke.\n\n\"We can solve that one,\" Thompson spoke. \"Space suits. And, now that we\nknow what we're looking for, we can clean out the ship. If we don't,\nBuster will do it for us.\"\n\n\"Space suits!\" As if he had heard no more than those two words, Fortune\nran from the room. He returned with three suits. They hastily donned\nthem.\n\n\"No damned bug can bite through one of these things,\" Neff said\nexultantly. \"Say, what about Grant? Hadn't we better take him a suit\ntoo?\"\n\n\"I should say so. Fortune....\" But Fortune was already leaving the room\non his errand. Thompson snapped open the intercom system. \"Grant?\"\n\n\"Yes, what is it?\"\n\n\"We've found the cause and we've got the disease licked.\"\n\nGrant's voice a shout coming back from the control room. \"Thank God.\nI've been sitting here watching Sol grow bigger and bigger....\" His\nvoice suddenly choked, went into silence, then came again, asking a\nquestion. \"Is it all right to change course now?\"\n\n\"Definitely it's all right,\" Thompson answered. \"In fact, it's an\norder.\"\n\nAn instant later, the ship groaned as the direction of flight was\nshifted. Thompson took a deep breath, was aware that Neff was staring at\nhim. \"What was that he said about watching Sol grow bigger and bigger?\nSay, what course were we on?\"\n\n\"Collision course with the sun,\" Thompson answered.\n\n\"What?\" Neff gasped. \"Do you mean to say that you were going to throw\nthe ship into the sun?\"\n\nSlowly Thompson nodded. \"I didn't know whether we would be alive or not\nbut I didn't want this ship to enter Sol Cluster and turn loose there\nthe virus that had already depopulated a planet.\"\n\nHe spoke slowly, with the sure knowledge of a desperate danger safely\npassed. Neff stared at him from round and frightened eyes.\n\nOn the desk top Buster gave up his vigil, meowed, and jumped into the\ncaptain's lap. With the thick gloves of his space suit clad hands,\nThompson fondly stroked him.\n\nBuster arched his back in grateful appreciation and began to purr.",
