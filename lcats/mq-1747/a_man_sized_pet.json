    "body": "by W. C. Tuttle\n\nAuthor of \u201cMagpie\u2019s Nightbear,\u201d \u201cA Bull Movement in Yellow Horse,\u201d etc.\n\n\nIt was an incongruous group that sat around the rough pine table in\nMagpie Simpkins\u2019s cabin, and played pitch by the light of an old smoky\nkerosene lamp.\n\nMagpie Simpkins, six feet two, slender to the point of emaciation, with\nthe face of a scholar above his walrus-like mustache, sat there peering\nat his cards through the only pair of glasses on Sleeping Creek.\n\nMagpie had been to Missoula a short time before and at the earnest\nsolicitation of an optician had purchased a pair of glasses, sans bows,\nwhich he fastened to his person through the medium of a wide silk\nribbon. At the present time he wore the ribbon around his neck for\nsafety.\n\nTellurium Woods, the second of the trio, was as fat as any outdoor man\ncould ever expect to be, and his bald head and luxuriant brown beard\ngave one the impression of looking at a billiard ball on a rug.\nTellurium affected buckskin shirts of his own manufacture and design,\nand it was impossible to tell, at the neck, just where the shirt left\noff and the skin began.\n\nBantie Weyman was the exact opposite of the others. He was about five\nfeet two inches in height and would weigh about a hundred. He had a\nsoprano voice, a gold tooth, and took baths. In the latter he differed\nfrom any one else on the range.\n\nBantie wasn\u2019t exactly a man\u2019s man but he did a man\u2019s work on his claim\nin Bear Gulch and claimed to be the champion sourdough bread-maker of\nthe world. Bantie was timid--so timid that he wouldn\u2019t pack a gun, and\nthe only armament of his cabin consisted of a .22 rifle with a section\nof cleaning-rod broken off inside the barrel.\n\nThese three represented the social column of Sleeping Creek. Their\ncabins were situated within a radius of two miles, and in order to keep\nup the social life of the district they had instituted a private pitch\nclub--two bits a corner and ten cents set back. The three were to\nalternate as hosts.\n\nAt this, their first session, there was a fourth party present. It\nseemed very much interested in the hands held by Bantie, much to\nBantie\u2019s embarrassment and to the huge delight of the others. Bantie\nplayed the jack of diamonds and snorted loudly as Magpie took it with\nthe queen and a chuckle.\n\n\u201cMagpie, yuh got to put that bear outside!\u201d he shrilled. \u201cHe gits his\ndanged nose in m\u2019 ear and I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m playin\u2019 th\u2019 jack or\nth\u2019 ace! I got th\u2019 ace--see? By golly! That sets me back three and\ncosts me ten cents! I ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to riffle another card until yuh puts\nthat emblem uh California out in th\u2019 shed, _sabe_?\u201d\n\n\u201cHaw! Haw!\u201d roared Tellurium. \u201cBe uh man, Bantie. That pore li\u2019l\ngrizzly won\u2019t hurt yuh. Look at him! He\u2019s plumb heart-broke over them\nwords, Bantie. While yore uh fair--jist fair--pitch player, Bantie, yuh\nlacks something. If yuh was simply sloppy with th\u2019 milk uh human\nkindness like me and Magpie you\u2019d git uh pet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat ultimatum,\u201d replied Bantie, \u201ccovers that wolf uh yours under th\u2019\nbunk, Tellurium. Every time I turns to spit I got to look into his\nshinin\u2019 eyes. Don\u2019t th\u2019 loafer never sleep?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d grinned Tellurium, \u201che ain\u2019t no regular Rip Van Winkle, but he\u2019s\ntame--tame enough fer uh man. I believes in uh man-sized pet and fer\nthat reason I cottons to th\u2019 wolf. Uh course he\u2019s only good fer uh grown\nman.\u201d\n\nBantie grunted and put on his coat.\n\n\u201cMy re-marks goes as she lays,\u201d he stated. \u201cI don\u2019t play with no danged\nmenagerie. It\u2019s bad enough to be whipsawed by uh pair uh snake-hunters\nlike you and Magpie but I draws th\u2019 line at havin\u2019 uh wolf under m\u2019 feet\nand uh grizzly workin\u2019 down wind behind m\u2019 ear. Why I----\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, Tellurium, did yuh ever see my bear dance?\u201d interrupted Magpie.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s there four ways from th\u2019 jack. Watch him now.\u201d\n\nMagpie slid the table over against the wall and took a rusty gold-pan\nfrom behind the stove. Using it as a tambourine, he began a shuffle on\nthe rough floor.\n\nThe bear watched him for a minute and then with a squeal of delight got\nup on its hind legs and began to prance around the cabin. Bantie forgot\nhis fear and began to shuffle too, while Tellurium sat with his feet\nover the end of the bunk and sang \u201cAnnie Laurie\u201d in a husky voice to the\ntune of \u201cA Hot Time.\u201d\n\nWhether through accident or design the bear danced straight for the\nshuffling Bantie, who was intent on watching his own toes. Bantie looked\nup as the bear was almost against him and he stepped back hurriedly out\nof harm\u2019s way. At least he was out of the bear\u2019s way but unfortunately\none of his boot heels landed squarely on the front foot of the wolf\nunder the bunk.\n\nA description of the rest of the action would be pure fiction as no one\nin the cabin ever knew just what did happen. Suffice to say that when\nthe explosion was over Magpie was under the table, Tellurium was under\nthe bunk, the bear was whining up on the rafters, Bantie and the wolf\nwere gone and so was the one window to the cabin.\n\nIt was probably ten minutes later that Bantie stuck his head into the\nopen window and panted:\n\n\u201cMy remarks still goes as she lays! I\u2019ll play solitaire until m\u2019 mind\ngoes abroad before I\u2019ll play in uh zoo like this again! Any time you\njaspers want to play with me jist leave th\u2019 specimens tied up, _sabe_?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid yuh git cut up any, Bantie?\u201d grinned Magpie.\n\n\u201cLost m\u2019 pants,\u201d stated Bantie in a soprano voice.\n\nTellurium grinned and took a fresh chew.\n\n\u201cBetter git uh pet to keep yuh company. Fine thing fer uh man.\u201d\n\nHis accent on the last word irritated Bantie so much that he shrugged\nhis thin shoulders and started off in the dark toward his cabin without\nreplying.\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d yelled Tellurium. \u201cWhat did yuh do with my wolf?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll git back some time tomorrow!\u201d shrilled Bantie. \u201cThat is, if he\ndon\u2019t lose m\u2019 return trail.\u201d\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next night Magpie and Tellurium ambled down to Bantie\u2019s cabin,\nostensibly to square things with Bantie but it is worthy of notice that\nthey took their pets along. Bantie wasn\u2019t home and the cabin was locked,\nso they went back to Tellurium\u2019s cabin and played single-handed poker.\n\nIt was four days later that Bantie sat in front of his cabin, and the\nstoop was gone from his shoulders. He was having the time of his life\nwatching a little gray kitten pull off stunts with an old newspaper.\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t he th\u2019 little rascal?\u201d he chuckled. \u201cGosh, he shore is some pet\nand that\u2019s whatever. I\u2019m shore pleased with his color--yes sir. Almost\nuh dead ringer fer--huh! That\u2019s goin\u2019 to be uh good joke if it works.\nIt\u2019s goin\u2019 to re-quire some thinkin\u2019. Twenty dollars rent! That\u2019s uh\nheap uh--gosh! Here comes Magpie down th\u2019 trail! Kitty, kitty,\nkitty--well, git in th\u2019 house then. Doggone, I got to cache that cat\nbefore he gits here.\u201d\n\nBantie was busy with his broom when Magpie leaned against the doorway\nwith a broad grin.\n\n\u201cHello, Bantie. When did yuh git back?\u201d\n\n\u201cYesterday afternoon. Come inside while I sweeps this dirt out.\u201d\n\nMagpie came in and sat down on the bunk.\n\n\u201cTo see yuh handle that broom, Bantie, reminds me uh heap of uh fee-male\nperson. You shore are finicky about yor floor.\u201d\n\nBantie blushed through his tan and swept vigorously.\n\nMagpie saw that he had riled Bantie so he continued:\n\n\u201cYou shore ought to have uh pet around yore cabin. Uh feller gits uh\nheap uh comfort out of uh pet. Now, old man Sims down at th\u2019 forks, has\ngot uh litter uh gray kittens and I know he\u2019d shore admire to give yuh\none. Uh course yuh don\u2019t want nothin\u2019 bigger nor more fee-rocious than\nhouse cats. Wild animal pets are only fit fer----\u201d\n\nHe had started to make a deprecatory gesture with his right hand, which\nhad suddenly come into contact with fur. Also the fur moved. Magpie took\none look and then swallowed his tobacco. A wildcat was sitting on the\nbunk beside him and two big, yellow eyes stared into his. Magpie knew\nwildcats--knew that no living animal could move more quickly. But if any\nwildcat had caught Magpie in the next ten seconds it would have set a\nnew record for the species.\n\nBantie dropped his broom as Magpie went past and then leaned against the\ndoorway and watched him slow down a hundred yards away and pull his gun\nas he whirled. The little gray kitten rubbed against Bantie\u2019s leg and he\npicked it up and cuddled it to his face as he watched Magpie scratch his\nneck and then amble off up the trail.\n\nTo say that Magpie was astonished as he plodded off up that trail would\nbe putting it mildly.\n\n\u201cI wonder if that was uh bob-cat?\u201d he queried aloud. \u201cDang it all, my\neyes ain\u2019t what they used to be. Leavin\u2019 my specs to home that away puts\nme plumb dim in th\u2019 vision, but--huh, that shore looked like uh\nbob-cat--yes sir! But shucks, it ain\u2019t possible! Bantie with uh\nbob-cat! No siree, it ain\u2019t reasonable I tell yuh! Must \u2019a\u2019 been my\neyes I reckon.\u201d\n\nHe went rumbling along the trail with his head down and nearly ran\nheadlong into Tellurium.\n\n\u201cWhoa, yuh old goat!\u201d yelled Tellurium. \u201cWhat yuh tryin\u2019 to do--butt\nyore way home?\u201d\n\n\u201cHowdy, Tellurium. Where yuh goin\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cReckoned I\u2019d pilgrim down and see if Bantie\u2019s got home yet. Did yuh see\nhim?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-ha. I stopped by his cabin fer uh spell.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he have anything to say about me and you and th\u2019 pets?\u201d asked\nTellurium, with a grin.\n\n\u201cNot uh word. I reckon he\u2019s done forgot it. Nice li\u2019l feller that\nBantie.\u201d\n\n\u201cNice enough fer uh runt, but I don\u2019t admire th\u2019 breed none. He\u2019s too\ndoggone scary, Magpie.\u201d\n\n\u201cUn-ha,\u201d agreed Magpie. \u201cHe shore ain\u2019t got no corner on nerve. Well, I\ngot to be goin\u2019. Come over tonight and play uh little poker. I don\u2019t\nsuppose Bantie wants to play but yuh might ask him.\u201d\n\nTellurium rambled off down the trail and Magpie stood there and watched\nhim for a while. Finally he scratched his neck and murmured:\n\n\u201cMebby I\u2019d ought to have told him but--shucks, it wasn\u2019t nothin\u2019--not uh\ndanged thing! But jist th\u2019 same I--huh!\u201d\n\nBantie was washing a pair of overalls in a battered dishpan when\nTellurium hove in sight, and he threw them over a stump to dry.\n\n\u201cHowdy, Bantie,\u201d greeted Tellurium, with a wide-mouthed grin. \u201cAs uh\nparticular feller you shore got \u2019em all skinned. Washin\u2019 overalls!\nWhat\u2019s th\u2019 use uh that? Say, I\u2019ll bet you takes uh bath too when nobody\nain\u2019t lookin\u2019. Haw! Haw! I knowed uh feller oncet who used to take uh\nbath twice uh month regular. Dang near rubbed all th\u2019 skin off hisself.\nYou ought to git uh buckskin shirt like mine, Bantie. Them skin shirts\nkeep yuh from gittin\u2019 dirty--sort a fit so tight th\u2019 dirt can\u2019t git in,\n_sabe_?\u201d\n\nBantie grinned and dried his hands.\n\n\u201cGo inside, Tellurium, and sit down while I gits some fresh water. I\ndrinks uh lot uh water this hot weather.\u201d\n\n\u201cUn-ha, I reckon yuh would,\u201d replied Tellurium, as Bantie took the pail\nand started for the creek. \u201cYes sir, I wouldn\u2019t put it uh bit past\nyuh--drinkin\u2019 lots uh water.\u201d\n\nIt was probably two minutes later when Bantie came back whistling with\nhis pail of water and entered the cabin.\n\n\u201cThis old Sleepin\u2019 Creek shore produces th\u2019 fine water,\u201d he remarked but\nthere was no response--the cabin was empty.\n\nHe walked to the door and looked around but there was no sign of\nTellurium.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s danged funny!\u201d he exclaimed aloud. \u201cWhere in thunder is\nTellurium?\u201d He went outside and walked around the cabin and then came in\nand looked under the bunk.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be uh----\u201d\n\nHe gasped as he pulled an object from under the bunk and held it up to\nthe light. It was a battered old sombrero and in the crown was punched\nthe initials, T. W.\n\n\u201cMama mine!\u201d chuckled Bantie. \u201cAnd Tellurium shore wasn\u2019t built fer\nsuch speed neither!\u201d\n\nThe little gray kitten on the bunk voiced its hunger and got a whole can\nof precious condensed milk for supper that night.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nTellurium went over to play poker with Magpie that night but neither of\nthem mentioned Bantie until the evening was nearly over. Magpie shoved\nback from the table and began to polish his glasses on a piece of\nbuckskin.\n\n\u201cMy eyes are gittin\u2019 plumb bad,\u201d he complained. \u201cSometimes I think I see\nthings and I know doggone well I don\u2019t. I reckon I\u2019d better wear my\nspecs all th\u2019 time.\u201d\n\n\u201cReckon I\u2019ll have to git some too,\u201d agreed Tellurium.\n\n\u201cYore vision botherin\u2019 yuh too?\u201d\n\n\u201cSame as yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen did yuh notice it first?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis afternoon. I--huh--say, Magpie, did yuh notice anything--well,\nsort a unusual down to Bantie\u2019s?\u201d\n\n\u201cSay!\u201d exploded Magpie, leaning across the table. \u201cDid you see it too?\u201d\n\n\u201c _Felt_ it is nearer th\u2019 word. Th\u2019 danged thing kept my Sunday hat!\u201d\n\nMagpie continued to polish his glasses and seemed lost in reflection.\n\n\u201cJist about what do yuh reckon it is?\u201d questioned Tellurium. \u201cI didn\u2019t\nstay long enough to make uh good estimate.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and me both,\u201d agreed Magpie. \u201cWhat little I saw of it shore\nre-sembled uh bob-cat, but bein\u2019 hasty thataway uh feller can\u2019t depend\non snap judgement. Knowin\u2019 Bantie like we do I\u2019m inclined to argue that\nwe both was seein\u2019 things which ain\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, mebby,\u201d half agreed Tellurium. \u201cBut if it was it\u2019s th\u2019 first time\nthat bad eyesight ever caused uh streak uh gray dynamite to crawl my\nframe and spit brimstone over my carcass and forcibly take my hat away.\nMebby I\u2019m seein\u2019 things, Magpie, but if I am I shore didn\u2019t start in th\u2019\nlower grades. No sir, I reckon I got into fast company immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell yuh what we\u2019ll do,\u201d continued Tellurium, getting up and\nputting on his coat, \u201cwe\u2019ll go down there tomorrow and take our pets\nalong. If that is uh bob-cat I\u2019d shore admire to have it hop my wolf.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd git yore wolf all scratched to shoestrings,\u201d grinned Magpie. \u201cMy\ngrizzly is more like it. Bob-cats as uh rule don\u2019t hanker none to climb\nth\u2019 frame of grizzlies.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take \u2019em both,\u201d replied Tellurium, settling the argument. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t care a dang what happens jist so I gits my hat back. That lid cost\nme twelve dollars five years ago and I longs fer it something\nscandalous, Magpie.\u201d\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next morning Magpie and Tellurium arrived at Bantie\u2019s cabin with\ntheir pets. The grizzly was a poor leader and Magpie was worn out\ntrying to drag several hundred pounds of protesting bear for two miles\nover a trail. Tellurium was equally tired from having to dig his heels\ninto the ground all the way trying to hold his wolf to a sedate pace.\n\nBantie was sitting in the shady side of his cabin reading, and on his\nlap lay a little gray kitten. Tellurium saw the kitten first and stopped\nin his tracks, but the wolf kept right on going and nearly upset\nBantie\u2019s chair. The kitten arched its back, clawed its way up the side\nof the cabin and spat at the wolf from the eaves.\n\n\u201cWhat yuh tryin\u2019 to do?\u201d yelled Bantie, trying to escape from the\nattentions of the pets. \u201cGol dang it! When yuh comes visitin\u2019 why don\u2019t\nyuh come a-lone!\u201d\n\n\u201cGivin\u2019 th\u2019 pets uh little airin\u2019,\u201d mumbled Magpie, still eying the\nkitten on the roof. \u201cWhere did yuh git th\u2019 kitten, Bantie?\u201d\n\n\u201cGot him from old man Sims uh few days ago. I needed company so I gits\nth\u2019 kitten. Didn\u2019t yuh see him when yuh was here before?\u201d\n\n\u201cSay,\u201d continued Bantie, before Magpie had a chance to answer, \u201cwhere\ndid yuh go th\u2019 other day, Tellurium? When I gits back with that pail uh\nwater yuh was gone. I finds the kitten maulin\u2019 yore hat around th\u2019 floor\nand you ain\u2019t no place in sight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI--I--huh! You say yuh finds that kitten playin\u2019 with my hat?\u201d\n\nBantie picked the hat off the bed and handed it to Tellurium.\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t that yore hat?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy golly, she shore is!\u201d exclaimed Tellurium. \u201cHow do yuh reckon that\nhat got down here? I must be gittin\u2019 absent minded, Magpie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckon yore both that way,\u201d grinned Bantie. \u201cTh\u2019 other day Magpie is\nhere sittin\u2019 comfortably on m\u2019 bunk, and all to oncet he shoots out of\nth\u2019 door and gallops off up th\u2019 trail. I stands here plumb surprised.\nI\u2019m plumb scared that he\u2019s loco.\u201d\n\nMagpie looked at Tellurium in an inquiring way, but Tellurium\u2019s face was\nhopelessly blank.\n\nThe bear and wolf, unleashed, wandered into the cabin just as Bantie\nstood up and remarked:\n\n\u201cYou fellers might as well come in out of th\u2019 sun. Mebby it was th\u2019 heat\nthat affected yuh. I\u2019ve got uh li\u2019l bottle of hooch from old man Sims\u2019\nkeg, and he told me that it was th\u2019----\u201d\n\n\u201cSay no more, Bantie,\u201d beamed Tellurium, starting for the cabin door\nclosely followed by the willing Magpie. \u201cOld man Sims gives me uh shot\nuh that stuff oncet and ever since that time I\u2019ve wished----\u201d\n\nCame a roar of pain and a yelp of surprise and the upheaval started. A\nstreak of roan-colored bear, with a gray hump on its back, hit Magpie\ndead center, knocking him back into Tellurium, and as they fell the bear\nraked them fore and aft and the wolf, yipping like the fiends of the bad\nplace were tied to its tail, raced across their prostrate bodies and\ndisappeared in a cloud of dust up the trail.\n\nThe wolf, running at its best speed, was a poor second to the bear. The\nbear was carrying weight but handled it nicely.\n\nBantie leaned against the door frame and shrilled his mirth in a high\nkey while the little gray kitten stood in the door and looked\ninquiringly at the two in the dust.\n\n\u201cWhat in ---- happened?\u201d wailed Magpie, feeling tenderly of a spot on\nhis chest where the bear had grasped a foothold.\n\n\u201cAvalanche!\u201d gasped Tellurium. \u201cTop of th\u2019 mountain busted right off\nand half of it hit me in th\u2019 belt-buckle. I reckon I\u2019d better light uh\nmatch to see if I\u2019m conscious.\u201d\n\nMagpie gazed ruefully up the trail as he brushed off his clothes.\n\n\u201cI wonder what got into them pets? Gosh, uh grizzly shore has uh lot uh\nmotive power when he gits a-goin\u2019! Where yuh goin\u2019, Tellurium?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 to find them animiles and see what\u2019s th\u2019 matter. Gol darn! I\nwouldn\u2019t take uh fortune fer that wolf. He\u2019s uh----\u201d\n\n\u201cMan-sized pet,\u201d finished Bantie with a grin, as he picked up the little\ngray kitten and snuggled it to his face. \u201cPore li\u2019l kitty, did they\nscare yuh?\u201d\n\n\u201cScare----!\u201d exploded Magpie. \u201cI\u2019ll bet--huh!\u201d\n\nHe turned and followed Tellurium up the trail, and Bantie watched them\nwith an expectant grin on his face. The trail led over a point of rocks\nabove the creek and at that point there was a sheer drop of about\nfifteen feet to the water, which was about five feet in depth.\n\nMagpie caught up with Tellurium at this place and they stopped to argue\nthe question. Beyond them the trail curved sharply around another cliff\nof rocks.\n\nTellurium shoved his hands into his pockets and faced Magpie\nbelligerently.\n\n\u201cIt don\u2019t stand to reason, Magpie, that uh house cat----\u201d\n\nHis argument was cut off. The avalanche had returned.\n\nBeing as the two were occupying most of the trail there was no chance to\navoid the shock. Tellurium had hold of Magpie\u2019s arm and the two of them\nperformed their aerial spin and dip of death as one person.\n\nThe chase had evidently turned as the wolf was in the lead and using all\nthe power of its legs and voice to hold that lead. The bear was due to\nslow up or run over the wolf if the race continued for a hundred yards\nfurther.\n\n\u201cLeggo my face!\u201d spluttered Magpie, trying to shake Tellurium\u2019s grip\nloose and grab a trailing willow shoot at the same time. \u201cWhat yuh\ntryin\u2019 to do, drown me?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t claw me--gimme room!\u201d gasped Tellurium. He lunged toward the\nbank and shook Magpie\u2019s hold from the willow.\n\n\u201cDanged hippopotamus, tread water!\u201d choked Magpie. \u201cLeggo my arm! If I\never gits you--gurgle--gurgle--on dry land--leggo!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did yuh push me in fer?\u201d wailed Tellurium.\n\nHe tried to stand up but the current was too strong and he went\npin-wheeling his way down the creek to a sand-bar. Magpie, relieved of\nTellurium\u2019s clutches, managed to grab the bank and pull himself out. He\nwandered down to where Tellurium was pouring the water out of his boots\nand sat down disconsolately on a log.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d shore admire to know what happened?\u201d he remarked. \u201cSomething shore\nhas happened that I ain\u2019t got no light on. Now, that danged little\nkitten ain\u2019t--huh, I dunno, I dunno.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it shore ain\u2019t,\u201d agreed Tellurium foolishly. \u201cBut if it ain\u2019t, what\nis? I asks yuh, Magpie, what is?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy ask me?\u201d demanded Magpie.\n\n\u201cDo yuh reckon I\u2019m uh palmist? I know one thing, I\u2019m goin\u2019 over and git\nmy bear. Whatever it is it ain\u2019t no place fer bears. I reckon I\u2019ll have\nto tame that pet all over again. Let\u2019s go over and interview Bantie.\u201d\n\nBantie was still standing in the door with his kitten on his arm and he\ngrinned widely at their dilapidated appearance.\n\nMagpie wiped his mustache and glared at Bantie.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my bear?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd also that wolf uh mine!\u201d snapped Tellurium.\n\n\u201cDo yuh want \u2019em sudden like or jist natural?\u201d inquired Bantie.\n\n\u201cSudden like suits me!\u201d stated Magpie. \u201cIf I could git away from this\nplace goin\u2019 uh thousand feet uh second I\u2019d feel that I was sort a\nloiterin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cWatch m\u2019 root-house door,\u201d said Bantie, as he shoved the kitten back\ninto the cabin and shut the door.\n\nThe root-house was simply a dug-out under the cabin, with a rough hinged\ndoor opening on a slant from the ground. The door was closed but not\nfastened. Magpie started to walk over and open it but he moved too late.\n\nCame a yelp and a grunt of fear and the door heaved up, nearly tearing\nthe hinges off, and the bear sailed out of the cellar and streaked for\nthe nearest tree.\n\nThe wolf hit only the highest points of the scenery until it came to a\nhigh point across the creek, where it stopped long enough to elevate its\nnose and voice its displeasure to the world.\n\nInside the cabin Bantie was down on his hands and knees, peering down\ninto the cellar through a hole made by removing some of the rough\nflooring. He pulled on a short rope and called softly and a full-grown\nwildcat climbed out of the hole and rubbed affectionately against his\nleg. Bantie tied the leash to the bunk leg and the cat crawled under the\nbunk.\n\n\u201cBy th\u2019 great horn spoon!\u201d exclaimed Bantie. \u201cYou shore are some pet!\nFrenchy Burgoyne said uh mouthful when he said that yuh didn\u2019t allow\nstrangers to trespass. Li\u2019l cat, yuh cost me jist twenty dollars rent\nbut yore shore worth it--every cent. I plumb hates to take yuh back but\nuh bargain\u2019s uh bargain. As uh bare-back rider of grizzlies I takes m\u2019\nhat off to you, li\u2019l bob-cat.\u201d\n\nOutside, Magpie and Tellurium leaned against each other and watched the\nwolf bid farewell to humanity.\n\nFinally, evidently with misgivings, the bear slid down out of the tree.\nIt gazed at the two with melancholy in its little eyes and then waddled\noff into the willows down Sleeping Creek.\n\nTellurium sat down heavily on a log and wiped his bald head with a wet\nhandkerchief.\n\n\u201cThis is gittin\u2019 to be th\u2019 dangdest----\u201d\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d exclaimed Magpie, pointing to the open root-house door. The\nlittle gray kitten was perched on the top step and its little ears\ntwitched as it looked cautiously about before coming out.\n\n\u201cWhat General Sherman said about war, goes double fer cats!\u201d remarked\nTellurium.\n\nMagpie scratched his neck thoughtfully for a moment and then started off\ndown the Sleeping Creek trail on a half run.\n\n\u201cWhere in ---- yuh goin\u2019?\u201d yelled Tellurium.\n\nMagpie stopped for a moment and considered the little kitten on the\nroot-house door, before he yelled back:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 down to dicker with old man Sims before he gits rid of all\nthat litter uh cats. I needs uh pet and I shore admires th\u2019 best there\nis.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and me both,\u201d agreed Tellurium fervently, and they went down the\ntrail together.",
