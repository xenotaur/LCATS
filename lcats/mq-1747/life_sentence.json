    "body": "Outside, bells were ringing. \"Happy New Year!\"\n\nThe mad sound of people crazed for the moment, shouting, echoed the\nbells.\n\n\"Happy New Year!\"\n\nA sound of music, waxing, waning, now joined in wild symphony by the\nvoices, now left alone to counterpoint the noise of human\ncelebration....\n\nFor a while, Oliver Symmes heard the raucous music of the crowd. It\nbecame a part of him, seemed to come from somewhere inside him, gave him\nlife. And then, as always, it passed on, leaving him empty.\n\nShadows....\n\nThe door to his room opened and a young-looking woman, dressed in a\npleasant green uniform, came in and turned up the light. On her sleeve\nshe wore the badge of geriatrician, with the motto, \"To Care for the\nAged.\"\n\n\"Happy New Year, Mr. Symmes,\" she said, and went over to stand by the\nwindow. In the mild light, the sheen of her hair attracted attention\naway from the slight imperfections of her face.\n\nShe watched the crowd outside, wishing she could be a part of it. There\nseemed so little life inside the prison where the only function of\nliving was the awaiting of death. \"To Care for the Aged.\" That meant to\nlike and love them as well as to take physical care of them. Only,\nsomehow, it seemed so hard to _really_ love them.\n\nShe sighed and turned away from the window to look at one of the reasons\nshe could not be with the rest of the world that night.\n\n\n\nHe sat bunched up in his chair like a vegetable. She could have closed\none of her hands around both his arms together. Or his legs. Bones and\nskin and a few little muscles left, and that was all. Skin tight,\ndrumlike, against the skull. Cheeks shrunk, lips slightly parted by the\ncontraction of the skin. Even the wrinkles he should have had were\nerased by the shrinkage of the epidermis. Even in a strong light, the\nfaint wrinkle lines were barely visible.\n\nAfter a moment of looking at him, she put a smile back on her face and\nrepeated her greeting.\n\n\"I said, 'Happy New Year,' Mr. Symmes.\"\n\nHe raised his eyes to her for a moment, then slowly lowered them,\nuncomprehendingly.\n\n\"He looks just a little bit like a caricature,\" she said to herself,\nfeeling a little more tenderness toward him. \"A cute little stick man\nmade of leaves and twigs and old bark and ...\"\n\n\n\n_Shadows._ For so long there had been shadows. And for a time the\nfleeting passage of dreams and past memories had been a solace. But now\nthe shadows were withered and old, debilitated and desiccated. They had\nbeen sucked dry of interest long ago.\n\nBut still they flitted through his mind on crippled wings, flapping\nabout briefly in the now-narrowed shell of his consciousness, then\nfading back among the cobwebs. Every once in a while, one of them would\nreturn to exercise its wings.\n\n\"Did she say, 'Happy New Year?'\" he wondered. \"New Year's?\"\n\nAnd, at the thought of it, there came shadows out of the past....\n\n\n\nYoung Oliver Symmes laughed. The girl laughed, too. She was good to hold\nin one's arms, soft like a furry animal, yielding and plush of mouth.\n\n\"I love you, Ollie,\" she said; the warmness of her body close against\nhis.\n\nHe laughed again and wrapped her in his arms. He owned her now, owned\nher smile, her love for him, her mind and her wonderful body. She\nbelonged to him, and the thrill of ownership was strong and exciting.\n\n\"I'll always love you, Ollie. I'll love only you.\" She ran her fingers\nin and out of his hair, caressing each strand as it went through her\nfingers. \"I love the strength of your arms, the firmness of your body.\"\n\nAgain he laughed, surrendering all his consciousness to the warm magic\nof her spell.\n\n\"I love the shading of your hair and eyes, the smooth angularity of your\ntallness, the red ecstasy of your mind.\" Her fingers slipped down the\nback of his neck, playing little games with his flesh and hair. \"I'll\nalways love you, Ollie.\"\n\nHe kissed her savagely.\n\nDuring the daytime, there was his work at the anthropological\nlaboratories, the joy of poking among the cultures of the past. And at\nnight there was the joy of living with her, of sharing the tantalizing\nstimulations of the culture of the present, the infinite varieties of\nlove mingling with passions.\n\nFor months there was this happiness of the closeness of her. And then\nshe was gone from him, for the moment. He still owned her, but they were\nphysically apart and there was the hunger of loneliness in him. The\nmonths his work kept them apart seemed like centuries, until, finally,\nhe could return.\n\n\n\nHe was walking through a happy, shouting crowd, walking back to her. It\nwas the eve of the new year, a time for beginnings, a time for looking\nfrom the pleasures of the past to those waiting in the future. There was\na happy outcry inside him that matched the mood of the crowd.\n\n\"Happy New Year!\"\n\nWomen stopped him on the street, asking for his affection. But he passed\nthem by, for she was waiting for him and he was hungry for the\npossessive love of his slave.\n\nHe went eagerly into the building where they lived.\n\n\n\nThe crowd was gone. A door was opening. The voice of his love, sudden,\nfull of naked surprise, bleated at him. And another voice, that of a man\nstanding behind her, croaked with hasty excuses and fear.\n\nA change of hungers--it seemed no more complex than that.\n\nHe put his hand to his side and took out a piece of shaped metal,\npointing it at the man. A blast of light and the man was dead. He put\nthe weapon aside.\n\nYoung Oliver Symmes walked toward the girl. She backed away from him,\npleading with words, eyes, body. He noticed for the first time the many\nsmall imperfections of her face and figure.\n\nCornered, she raised her arms to embrace him. He raised his arms to\nanswer the embrace, but his hands stopped and felt their way around the\nwhiteness of her neck. He pressed his hands together, thumbs tight\nagainst each other.\n\nMinutes later, he dropped her to the floor and stood looking at her. He\nhad owned her and then destroyed her when his ownership was in dispute.\n\nHe bent to kiss the lax lips.\n\n\n\nShadows. As a man grows older, the weight and size of his brain\ndecrease, leaving cavities in his mind. The years that pass are a\ndigger, a giant excavator, scooping the mass of past experience up in\nthe maw of dissipation. The slow, sure evacuation of the passing decades\nleaves wing-room in a man's head for stirring memories.\n\nThe withered man looked up again. The woman in the green uniform was\nsmiling at him through parted, almost twisted lips.\n\n\"I suppose that this time of year is the worst for you, isn't it?\" she\nasked sympathetically. The first requirement of a good geriatrician was\nsympathy and understanding. She determined to try harder to understand.\n\nThe old man made no answer, only staring at her face. But his eyes were\nblank--seeing, yet blind to all around him. She frowned for a moment as\nshe looked at him. The unnatural hairlessness of his body puzzled her,\nmaking it difficult for her to understand him while the thought was in\nher mind--that and the trouble she had getting through to him.\n\nShe stared at him as if to pierce the blankness of his gaze. Behind his\neyes lay the emptiness of age, the open wound of stifled years.\n\n\"I'll move you over to the window, Mr. Symmes,\" she told him in soothing\ntones, her smile reappearing. \"Then you can look out and see all the\npeople. Won't that be fun?\"\n\nPicking up a box from the table, she adjusted a dial. The chair in which\nhe was sitting rose slightly from the floor and positioned itself in\nfront of the window. The woman walked to the wall beside him and\ncorrected the visual index of the glass to match the weakness of the old\nman's eyes.\n\n\"See, down there? Just look at them pushing about.\"\n\nA rabble of faces swam on the glass in front of him, faces of unfamiliar\npeople, all of them unknown and unknowable to him.\n\nInside him the whisper of the wings mounted in pitch with a whining,\nleathery sound. The images of dead faces came flying up, careening\nacross his mind, mingling and merging with the faces of the living. The\nglass became an anomalous torrent of faces.\n\nDead faces....\n\n\n\nFour walls around him, bare to the point of boredom. Through the barred\nwindow, the throbbing throat of the crowd talked to him. His young body\ntook it in, his young mind accepted it, catalogued it and pushed it out\nof consciousness. And for each individual voice there was an individual\nface, staring up at his cell from the comparative safety of outside.\nYoung Oliver Symmes could not see the faces from where he sat, waiting,\nbut he could sense them.\n\nThere came a feel of hands on his shoulder; his reverie was interrupted.\nArms under his raised him to his feet. A face smiled, almost kindly, in\nunderstanding.\n\n\"They're waiting for you, Mr. Symmes. It's time to go.\"\n\nMore words. Walking from this place to that, mostly with a crowd of\npeople at his shoulders, pressing him in. Then a door ahead of him,\nornate in carving, a replica of the doors to the Roman Palace of Justice\nmany centuries before. Again his mind catalogued the impressions.\n\nThen, like the faces of the people outside his cell, the pictures of the\nbas-relief faded away, melted and merged into a pelagic blackness.\n\nThe doors opened and, with part of the crowd still at his side, he went\nthrough. The people inside were standing; stick men, it seemed to him,\nwith painted balloons for faces. The sound of the rapping of a gavel\ncaught his ear. The people sat, and the trial began.\n\n\"This court will admit to evidence only those events and artifacts which\nare proved true and relevant to the alleged crime.\"\n\nAn obsequious clearing of throats. A coughing now and then.\n\n\"... And did you see the defendant, Oliver Symmes, enter the apartment\nof the deceased on the night of the Thirty-first of December, two\nthousand and ...\"\n\n\"I did. He was wearing a sort of orange tunic ...\"\n\nSomeone whispered in his ear. Oliver Symmes heard and shook his head.\n\n\"... You are personally acquainted with the defendant?\"\n\n\"I am. We worked for United Anthropological Laboratories before he ...\"\n\n\"Objection.\"\n\n\"Sustained.\"\n\nThe blackness of the judge's robe puzzled him. A vestige, an\nanachronism, handed down from centuries before. White was the color of\ntruth, not black.\n\n\"You swear that you found the defendant standing over the body of the\ndeceased woman on the night of ...\"\n\n\"Not standing, sir. He was bending over, kissing ...\"\n\n\"Your witness.\"\n\n\n\nDays of it, back and forth, testimony and more testimony. Evidence and\nmore evidence and the lack of it. Smiling lawyers, grimacing lawyers,\nsoothing lawyers and cackling lawyers. And witnesses.\n\n\"You will please take the stand, Mr. Symmes.\"\n\nHe walked to the chair and sat down. The courtroom leaned forward, the\nstick men bowed toward him slightly, as in eager applause of the coming\nmost dramatic moment of a spectacle.\n\n\"You will please tell the court in your own words ...\"\n\nHe mouthed the words. The whole story, the New Year's crowd, his hunger\nfor her, his arrival, the other man and his babbling, the woman and how\nshe looked, his feelings, his transfigured passions, and the deaths. He\ntold the story again and again until they seemed satisfied.\n\n\"You understand, Mr. Symmes, that you have committed a most heinous\ncrime. You have killed two people in a passion that, while it used to be\nforgiven by the circumstances, is no longer tolerated by this\ngovernment. You have killed, Mr. Symmes!\"\n\nThe face before him was intense. He looked at it, not understanding the\nreason for the frozen look of malice and hatred.\n\n\"She was mine. When she betrayed me, I killed her. Is that wrong?\"\n\nThe stick men snorted and poked each other in the ribs with derisive\nelbows.\n\nThere were more words and more questions. He looked at the face of the\njudge and wondered, for a moment, if perhaps the color of the robe was\nto match the apparent disposition of the man.\n\nAnd then came the silence, a time of sitting and waiting. He sensed the\nwondering stares of the stick men, wide-eyed in apprehension, suspended\nfrom the drabness of their own lives for the moment by the stark\nvisitation of tragedy in his. They gabbled among themselves and wagered\non the verdict.\n\nThe man next to him leaned over and tapped him on the arm. Everyone\nstood up and then, curiously, sat down again almost at once. He felt the\ntension present in the courtroom, but was strangely relaxed himself. It\nwas peculiar that they were all so excited.\n\n\"Your Honor, having duly considered the seriousness of the crime and the\nevidence presented ...\"\n\nThe balloon faces on the stick men stretched in anticipation.\n\n\"... taking full cognizance of the admitted passion on the part of the\ndefendant and the circumstances ...\"\n\nThe balloons were strained, contorted out of all proportion in their\neagerness.\n\n\"... we find the defendant guilty of murder, making no recommendation\nfor consideration by the Court.\"\n\nThe balloons exploded!\n\n\n\nDeafening and more than deafening, the uproar of the voices was beyond\nbelief. He threw his hands up over his ears to shut out the noise.\n\nThe gavel crashed again and again, striking the polished oak in deadly\ncadence, stifling the voices. Over the stillness, one man spoke. He\nrecognized the black voice of the judge and took his hands from his ears\nand put them in his lap. He was told to stand and he obeyed.\n\n\"Oliver Symmes, there has been no taking of human lives in this nation\nfor many years, until your shockingly primitive crime. We had taken\npride in this record. Now you have broken it. We must not only punish\nyou adequately and appropriately, but we must also make of your\npunishment a warning to anyone who would follow your irrational example.\n\n\"Naturally, we no longer have either the apparatus to execute anyone or\nan executioner. We do not believe that a stupidly unreasoning act should\nincite us to equally unreasoning reprisal, for we would then be as\nguilty of irrationality as you.\n\n\"We must establish our own precedent, since there is no recent one and\nthe ancient punishments are not acceptable to us. Therefore, because we\nare humane and reasoning persons, the Court orders that the defendant,\nOliver Symmes, be placed in the National Hospital for observation, study\nand experimentation so that this crime may never again be repeated. He\nis to be kept there under perpetual care until no possible human skill\nor resource can further sustain life in his body.\"\n\nSomeone jumped erect beside him, quivering with horror and indignation.\nIt was his lawyer.\n\n\"Your Honor, we throw ourselves upon the mercy of the Court. No matter\nwhat the crime of the defendant, this is a greater one. For this is a\ncrime not just against my client, but against all men. This sentence\nrobs all men of their most precious freedom--the right to die at their\nappointed times. Nothing is more damaging to the basic dignity of the\nhuman race than this most hideous ...\"\n\n\"... This Court recognizes only the four freedoms. The freedom of death\nis not one of these. The sentence stands. The Court is adjourned.\"\n\nThere were tears in the eyes of his lawyer, although young Oliver Symmes\ndid not quite comprehend, as yet, their meaning. Hands, rougher than\nbefore, grasped his arms with strange firmness and led him off into ...\n\n\n\nShadows. They come in cycles, each prompted to activity by the one\npreceding it. They flutter in unbelievable clusters, wheel in\nuntranslatable formations through the cerebric wasteland that is the\naged mind of Oliver Symmes. They have no meaning to him, save for a\nfurtive spark of recognition that intrudes upon him once in a while.\n\nThe woman in the green uniform, standing to one side of the window,\nsmiled at him again. It was much simpler to care for him, she thought,\nif only one conceived of him as being a sort of sweet little worn-out\nteddy bear. Yes, that was what he was, a little teddy bear that had\ngotten most of its stuffing lost and had shriveled and shrunk. And one\ncan easily love and pamper a teddy bear.\n\n\"Can you see the crowd all right, Mr. Symmes? This is a good place to\nwatch from, isn't it?\"\n\nHer words fell upon his ears, setting up vibrations and oscillations in\nthe basilar membranes. Nerve cells triggered impulses that sped along\nneural pathways to the withered cortex, where they lost themselves in\nthe welter of atrophy and disintegration. They emerged into his\nconsciousness as part of a gestaltic confusion.\n\n\"Isn't it exciting, watching from here?\" she asked, showing enthusiasm\nat the sight of the crowd below. \"You should be enjoying this immensely,\nyou know. Not all the people here have windows to look out of like\nthis.\" There, now, that should make him feel a little better.\n\nHis eyes, in their wandering, came to rest upon her uniform, so cool and\ncomforting in its greenness. A flicker of light gleamed from the\nmetallic insignia on her sleeve: \"To Care for the Aged.\" Somewhere\ninside him an association clicked, a brief fire of response to a past\nevent kindled into a short-lived flame, lighting the way through cobwebs\nfor another _shadow_....\n\n\n\nHow many years he had been waiting for the opportunity, he did not know.\nIt seemed like decades, although it might have been only a handful of\nmonths. And all the time he had waited, he could feel himself growing\nolder, could sense the syneresis, the slow solidifying of the life\nelements within him. He sat quietly and grew old, thinking the chance\nwould never come.\n\nBut it did come, when he had least expected it.\n\nIt was a treat--his birthday. Because of it, they had given him actual\nfood for the first time in years: a cake, conspicuous in its barrenness\nof candles; a glass of real vegetable juices; a dab of potato; an\nindescribable green that might have been anything at all; and a little\nsteak. A succulent, savory-looking piece of genuine meat.\n\nThe richness of the food would probably make him sick, so unaccustomed\nto solid food was his digestive tract by now, but it would be worth the\npain.\n\nAnd it was then that he saw the knife.\n\nIt lay there on the tray, its honed edge glittering in the light of the\nsun. A sharp knife, capable of cutting steak--or flesh of any kind.\n\n\"Well, how do you like your birthday present, Mr. Symmes?\"\n\nHe looked up quickly at the woman standing beside the tray. The yellow\npallor of her middle-aged skin matched the color of her uniform. She\nwore the insignia of a geriatrics supervisor.\n\nHe let a little smile flicker across his face. \"Why, it's ... it's\nwonderful. I never expected it at all. It's been so long, you know. So\nvery long.\"\n\nHow could he get rid of her? If he tried anything with her watching, she\nwould stop him. And then he'd never get another chance.\n\n\"I'm glad you like it, Mr. Symmes. Synthetic foods do get tiresome\nafter a while, don't they?\"\n\nThe idea came with suddenness and he responded to it quickly.\n\n\"But where are my pink pills? I always take them at lunch.\"\n\n\"You won't need them if you're eating real food.\"\n\nHe whipped his voice into petulance. \"Yes, I will! I don't care if it is\nreal food--I want my pills!\"\n\n\"I'll get them for you later. Go ahead and eat first.\"\n\n\"I can't eat until I take my pink pills! You ought to know that! I won't\ntouch a thing until I get them! You've ruined my birthday party.\"\n\nThe whims of the aging are without logic, so she went to get the pills,\nleaving Oliver Symmes and the gleaming, sharp knife together,\nunattended.\n\n\n\nWhere should he start? The heart? No, that would be too quick, too easy\nto repair. Then where?\n\nHe remembered his studies of the middle Japanese culture and the methods\nof suicide practiced at that time. The intestines! So many of them to\ncut and slash at, so much damage that might be done before death set in!\nMaybe even the lungs! But he must hurry.\n\nPicking up the knife, he pointed it at his appendix. For a moment he\nhesitated, and his eyes observed again the little feast laid out before\nhim. He thought briefly about pausing for just a while to taste the\nlittle steak, to nibble briefly at the delectable-looking cake. He hated\nto leave it untouched. It had been such a long time....\n\nThe sudden memory of time, and how much of it he had spent hoping for\nthis moment, snapped his attention back to the knife. Steeling his grip\non it, he pressed it in hard.\n\nHis eyes bulged with the excruciating pain as he wrenched the knife from\nright to left, twisting it wildly as he went, blindly slashing at his\nvital organs with the hope that once and for all he could stop the long\nand eternal waiting.\n\nHis mouth filled with the taste of blood. He spat it out through\nclenched teeth. It gushed down his chin, staining the cleanness of his\nrobe. His lips parted to scream.\n\nAnd then his eyes closed.\n\n\n\nAnd opened again! He was staring at the ceiling, but the men and women\nstanding around him got in his way.\n\nTheir lips were moving, their faces unperturbed.\n\n\"That was a nasty thing for him to do.\"\n\n\"They all do it, once or twice, until they learn.\"\n\n\"Third time for him, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, I believe so. First time he tried hanging himself. Second time he\nwas beating his head against the wall when we came and stopped him.\nBloody mess that one was.\"\n\n\"Nothing to compare with this, of course.\"\n\n\"Well, naturally.\"\n\nOliver Symmes felt sick with fear of frustration.\n\n\"Nice technique you showed, Doctor. He'd been dead at least an hour when\nwe started, hadn't he?\"\n\n\"Almost two,\" someone else said. \"An amazing job.\"\n\n\"Thank you. But it wasn't too difficult. Just a little patching here and\nthere.\"\n\nHe felt his legs being shifted for him.\n\n\"Be careful there, Nurse. Handle him gently. _Fragilitas Ossium_, you\nknow. Old bones break very easily.\"\n\n\"Sorry, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Not that we couldn't fix them up immediately if they did.\"\n\n\"Naturally, Doctor.\"\n\n\"I wish they'd try something different for a change.\"\n\n\"The woman in the next room lost an eye last year, trying to reach the\nprefrontals. Good as new now, of course.\"\n\nHe wanted to vomit at the uselessness of it all.\n\n\"By the way, what's he in for? Do you know?\"\n\n\"No, I'd have to look it up.\"\n\n\"Probably newness.\"\n\n\"Or taxes.\"\n\n\"Or maybe even slander.\"\n\n\"Is that on the prescribed antisocial list now?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. It was passed just before the destructive criticism law.\"\n\n\"Think he'll try this messy business again?\"\n\n\"They all do.\"\n\n\"They do, don't they? Don't they ever learn it's no use?\"\n\n\"Eventually. Some are just harder to convince than others.\"\n\nThe pain was gone. He closed his eyes and slipped off into darkness\nagain and into ...\n\n\n\nShadows. In slow and ponderous fashion they float across the sea of his\nmind, like wandering bits of sargasso weed on the brackish water of a\ndying ocean. Each one dreamed a thousand times too many, each separate\nstrand of memory-weed now nothing but a stereotyped shred of what might\nhave once been a part of life and of living.\n\nWith the quietness of deserted ships they drift in procession past his\nsphere of consciousness. Wait! There's one that seems familiar. He stops\nthe mental parade for a moment, not hearing the voice of his companion,\nthe woman in the green uniform.\n\n\"It's getting late, Mr. Symmes.\" She turned from the window and glanced\nat the wizenedness, the fragile remainder of the man, the almost empty\nshell. It was a pity he wasn't able to play games with her like some of\nthe others. That made it so much easier. \"Don't you think it's about\ntime you went to bed? Early to bed and early to rise, you know.\"\n\nThat memory of a needle, pointed and gleaming. What was it?\n\nOh, yes. Stick it in his arm, push the plunger, pull it out; and wait\nfor him to die. First one disease and then another, to each he happily\nsuccumbed, in the interests of science, only to be resuscitated. Each\ntime a willing volunteer, an eager guinea pig, he had hoped for the ease\nof death, praying that for once they'd wait too long, the germs would\nprove too virulent, that something would go wrong.\n\n\"There, now, you just lie back and get comfortable,\" she said, walking\nover to the table. \"But it has been fun, hasn't it? Watching the crowds,\nI mean.\" She felt he must be much happier now, and the knowledge of it\ngave her a sense of success. She was living up to her pledge, \"To Care\nfor the Aged.\"\n\nDiabetes, tuberculosis, cancer of the stomach, tumor of the brain. He'd\nhad them all, and many others. They had swarmed to him through the\ngouged skin-openings made by the gleaming needle. And each had brought\nthe freedom of blackness, of death, sometimes for an hour, sometimes for\na whole week. But always life returned again, and the waiting, waiting,\nwaiting.\n\n\"I enjoy New Year's myself,\" the woman said, her hands caressing a dial.\nSlowly, with gentle undulation, his chair rose from the floor and\ncradled the aged tiredness that was Oliver Symmes to his bed. With\nalmost tender devotion, his body was mechanically shifted from the\nportable chair to the freshly made bed.\n\n\n\nOne of his arms was caught for just a moment under the slight weight of\nhis body. There was a short, snapping sound, but Oliver Symmes took no\nnotice. His face remained impassive. Even pain had lost its meaning.\n\n\"It's a pity we couldn't have been outside with the rest of them,\ncelebrating,\" she said, as she arranged the covers around him, not\nnoticing the arm herself.\n\nThis was the part of her job she enjoyed most--tucking the nice little\nman into bed. He did look sweet there, under the covers, didn't he?\n\n\"Just imagine, Mr. Symmes, another year's gone by, and what have we\naccomplished?\"\n\nHer prattle seeped in and he became aware of it and what she was saying.\nNew Year?\n\n\"What--what year--is this?\" He spoke with great difficulty, from the\nlong disuse of vocal cords. It was hardly more than a whisper, but she\nheard and was startled.\n\n\"Why, Mr. Symmes, it's been so long since you've talked.\" She paused,\nbut realized that she had not answered his question.\n\n\"It's '73, of course. Last year was '72, so tonight's the start of '73.\"\n\n'73? Had it been fifty years since he came here? Had it been just that\nlong?\n\n\"What--\" She leaned closer to him as he struggled for the word.\n\"What--century?\"\n\nHer astonishment was gone. He was teasing her, like the woman on the\nnext level. These old ones were great for that!\n\n\"Now, Mr. Symmes, everybody knows what century it is.\" She smiled at him\nglowingly, thinking she had caught him at a prank. It was nice, she\nthought, to have gotten through to him tonight, on the eve of the new\nyear. That meant that she was living up to her motto the way she ought\nto be.\n\nShe'd have to tell the supervisor about it.\n\nOliver Symmes turned to face the ceiling, his mind full of dusty\nwhispers. What century was it? She hadn't answered. It might have been a\nhundred and fifty years ago he came here, instead of just fifty. Or\npossibly two hundred and fifty, or ...\n\n\"Now, you be good, and sleep tight, and I'll see you in the morning.\"\nHer hand passed over a glowing stud and the room light dimmed to a quiet\nglow. Lying there in the bed, he did look like a teddy bear, a dear\nlittle teddy bear. She was so happy.\n\n\"Good night, Mr. Symmes.\"\n\nShe closed the door.\n\n\n\nOutside, bells were ringing.\n\n\"Happy New Year.\"\n\nThe ceiling stared back at him.\n\nThe mad sound of people crazed for the moment, shouting, echoed the\nbells.\n\n\"Happy New Year!\"\n\nHe turned his head to one side.\n\n\"Happy New Year!\"\n\nAnd again ... and again ... and again.\n\n                                                     --JAMES McCONNELL\n\n",
