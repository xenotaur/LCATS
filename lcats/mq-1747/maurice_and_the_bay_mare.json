    "body": "Maurice the groom sidled up to me, indecision in the flicker of his\nbright brown eyes--indecision, which held him, with one hand raised to\nthe level of my shoulder affectionately, as though he wished to\nemphasize the appeal so evident in his attitude. A quaint smile touched\nthe corner of his mouth and vanished. A stranger might have thought\nMaurice timorous--Maurice, who had in his day ridden many a steeplechase\nin Ireland.\n\n\u201cWhy do you take the mare out?\u201d he said and glanced about to make sure\nthat the other grooms could not hear him. \u201cWhy not have one of the boys\ngive her a half hour in the ring, first? She has stood up three days,\nsir. I\u2019m begging your pardon for mentioning it, but we\u2019ve both been\nhurted by horses before, sir, and, you know, it ain\u2019t like when we were\nyounger. Why do you take the risk?\u201d\n\nThere was a fine deference in his manner and more--a solicitude that\nrather astonished me.\n\n\u201cThen the mare is in your string?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThey fetched her up from the lower stable three days ago,\u201d he replied.\n\nI had forgotten that Maurice did not know the mare well. She had but\nrecently arrived from Tennessee, and even more recently she had been\ntransferred to his stable.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t take the risk, sir,\u201d he reiterated in a whisper.\n\nI was about to say, \u201cOh, yes, you would!\u201d but I could hardly resort to\nsuch a cheap acknowledgment of his kindness. To have overcome his usual\ndiffidence and made any suggestion at all, had cost him an effort,\nevident in the heightened color of his clean-shaven, pink cheeks. He\nglanced toward the grooms. A quick light shone in his brown eyes when he\nagain looked up at me.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll ride her, sir?\u201d\n\nThis was not so much a question as a challenge. He had raised his voice\na bit, evidently intending the other grooms should hear him. I thanked\nhim and told him to get the mare ready. I wondered if she had developed\nsome dangerous trick since he had been taking care of her. I was curious\nand, I admit, a trifle nervous.\n\nInstantly Maurice\u2019s manner changed. He nodded, shuffled to the stall,\nand led the mare out. Deftly he snapped the pillar reins in the halter\nring. With brush and cloth he went over her from muzzle to hoof\naccompanying each stroke with a sibilant breath. The mare was spotless\nand sleek, yet Maurice\u2019s old-country pride would not allow him to turn a\nhorse out that did not shine like burnished copper. Even in the\nsemidarkness of the runway, her coat glowed and shimmered like sunlight\non water. When it came to \u201cdoing\u201d horses, Maurice had no favorites. He\nwas as impartial as a machine.\n\nI could hear him talking to the mare.\n\n\u201cThere, now! Be quiet, ye huzzy! \u2019Tis old Maurice that\u2019s taking up your\nfoot and not some murdering horseshoer, me lady! Be a good girl, now!\n\u2019Tis not I that would hurt you!\u201d\n\nSchooled to the pillar reins, yet resenting them, the mare stamped with\nhaughty impatience.\n\nBridled and saddled, she was led out, her fine, glossy coat changing\nhue, as she moved, her head high, her ears sharply to the front. In her\nfull eye glowed the courage of her breeding, not unmixed with mischief.\nMaurice made her pose and held down the right stirrup.\n\n\u201cShe has ideas of her own, sir,\u201d he said, as I mounted. \u201cA light hand\nand firm is what she needs. Good luck, sir.\u201d\n\nGently he let go of her head and stepped back. The mare quivered and\nbounded forward, tugging at the snaffle. She swept out of the yard and\nstruck into a singlefoot--a gait natural to her, as natural as the high\ncarriage of her head and tail. We swung into the bridle trail leading up\nthe valley toward the hills.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe trail was arched by wide-spreading branches of oaks and\nsilver-mottled sycamores, and dappled with sunlight and shade. A gray\nsquirrel scampered along a limb and leaped to a slender branch that bent\nand swayed above us. Yet the mare did not flinch, but swept on, her\nhoofs sounding a muffled rhythm on the soft earth. I marked squirrels\noff the tentative list of unpleasant possibilities. Round a wide bend in\nthe trail the mare stepped on a slender, fallen branch. It snapped, and\na piece of it flicked up and struck her, yet she did not flinch or play\nup. A vagrant wind, drifting along the afternoon hillside, scattered a\nheap of dead leaves piled beside the trail. The mare hesitated the least\nbit, then shook her head and went on. Fallen branches and dead leaves\nwere scratched from the list. Farther along, a Mexican, clearing out\nbrush, rose suddenly and stared at us. The mare stopped and snorted, not\nbecause she was actually frightened, but rather because she was\nindignant at being startled.\n\nI scratched sudden Mexicans off the list. A horse would hardly be worth\nriding that would not be startled by such an apparition. A straight\nstretch offered, and I put the mare into a canter. She went collectedly,\nsmoothly, and with fine restraint. My suspicions were rocked to sleep. I\nhad begun to get the pace of the mare, to get in tune with her mood and\nmanner of going. When such harmony is attained, riding becomes a\nsuperlative delight. But delights are ephemeral.\n\nAt the head of the valley are the gravel pits. And up toward the head of\nthe valley a road crosses the bridle trail diagonally, a modern road,\nhard-surfaced and commercial. It is a highway for mammoth steel gravel\ntrucks that, empty and loaded, go and come day and night. Their right of\nway is never disputed or ignored. What do they care about mere\nautomobiles or even more insignificant horses and riders? These trucks\nare the clamoring juggernauts of civilization.\n\nShortly before we came within sight of this hazardous crossing, both the\nmare and I were aware of the heavy boom and roar of a motor. The mare\nstopped abruptly. I urged her on. She responded, going at a walk, but\ndaintily, as though afraid of treacherous ground. I felt her grow tense.\nI surmised that she intended to whirl and run. The sound of the motor\ngrew louder. I tried to take the mare on, that she might at least see\nwhat caused the noise, but she refused. Then, with the rattle and clash\nand clang of a drayload of iron pipe over cobbles, an empty gravel truck\nthundered past. The mare laid back her ears, whirled, and bolted.\n\nIt happened that I was fortunate enough to accompany her, but in a more\nor less impromptu manner. I had been told, often enough, that there are\ncertain rules to observe in such cases: Use your legs; take a firm hold\nof the snaffle; don\u2019t take hold too hard; give your horse his head; sit\ndown and ride; let him see that you are not afraid of that which\nfrightened him; speak to him quietly; keep him going on. These rules are\nall very well, but the difficulty seems to be that there are no two\ncases exactly alike. About all there was left to do was to sit down and\ntry to ride. Also, there were branches and tree trunks to dodge. The\nmare was cutting turns, with a wild disregard of obstacles. She did not\nseem especially interested in taking me past them if she cleared them\nherself.\n\nI had a vision of foliage whisking past, of a winding trail that swept\ndizzily underneath, and of a sharp pair of upstanding ears, ever pointed\ntoward the south and the stables. By great good fortune, I managed to\nget the mare down to a reasonable gallop before we made the turn into\nthe stable yard. We made it together, but I came along merely as a\npassenger, not a rider. She stopped at the entrance to the stable, drew\na deep breath, and stood quietly, with ears pointed sharply to the\nfront.\n\nMaurice came up, a quizzical smile tugging at one corner of his mouth.\nHe stroked the mare\u2019s neck.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be taking her out again?\u201d he asked.\n\nI told him that I had dropped my whip, and thought I\u2019d go back and get\nit.\n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget to pick up your hat, also,\u201d he said. \u201cI have known a\ngentle horse to shy at a hat in the road, him thinking, most like, that\nit was no place for a hat, anyhow.\u201d\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain the mare went out of the yard, now, at a walk. Arrived at the\nmemorable crossing, she sidled, but went on. And when we returned, about\nan hour later, it was evident that she had not forgotten the gravel\ntruck. While she was doing her best to behave, she did not intend to be\ncaught napping. Back at the stable, I sat down in Maurice\u2019s old\narmchair, fetched from the tack room. Patiently he led the mare round\nand round the quadrangle, cooling her. He gave her a little water, then\nwalked her again. Presently he fetched her up, took off her cooler, and\nwent to work. Sponge, rag, brush, and water bucket--ten minutes, twenty\nminutes, and he was still at it. At last he led her to her stall,\nblanketed her, and gave her some hay.\n\nTwo of the grooms came from the stable, on their way to supper. Maurice\nputtered about, hanging up this tie rope and that halter, straightening\nthe coolers on their racks, and tidying up the runway. Long shadows of\nearly evening reached across the quadrangle. Quail called plaintively\nfrom the brushy hillside, west of the stable buildings. The sound of\ncontented munching came from the stalls. Maurice fetched another chair\nfrom the tack room and sat down.\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t you be late for supper?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cIt can wait. I\u2019ll rest a bit.\u201d He glanced at me, his head the least bit\nto one side, a twinkle of humor in his bright brown eyes. \u201cThe mare,\nnow--and did you have a good ride?\u201d\n\nI nodded and tried to appear casual.\n\n\u201c\u2019Twas good that you took her out the second time,\u201d he said. \u201cGood for\nthe both of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt might have been worse,\u201d I told him.\n\n\u201cAnd you need not be telling me that, sir. But you must have patience\nwith her. She is young and green--a country girl, sir, with manners to\nlearn and city ways and the like. She is not mean, nor is she a fool.\nIt\u2019s the wise head she has, and all the more reason for a man to be wise\nin the handling of her. You cannot fight her kind, nor can you let her\nbe the boss. I would take her along at any gait, but I would not let her\ntake me, when she had a mind to. \u2019Tis hard to explain, but if you have\nthe feeling for a horse, \u2019tis but a matter of time and patience, and\nyou\u2019ll be riding as sweet a mare as ever I laid a brush to. You see,\nsir, I was not always a groom.\u201d\n\nI told him that he was a whole lot more than that, as far as I was\nconcerned. Perhaps, because I meant it, Maurice felt inclined to talk\nintimately of his past or a portion of it.\n\n\u201cI was not always a groom,\u201d he reiterated. \u201cOne time I had a little\nmoney put by and some good clothes.\u201d He smiled wistfully. \u201cI\u2019ll not tell\nyou about Ireland and the steeplechases and flat races I rode when I was\na lad. And I was no more than a young man when I came to America. New\nYork it was, where I worked for a gentleman, at his country place, a\nmillionaire, sir, but that did not hinder him from being a fine\nhorseman. I rode his hunters, trained them, and showed many a jumper of\nhis at the Garden. Being a bit handy with the ribbons, there would be\ntimes when I would be driving his four-in-hand. He paid good wages. I\nput by a little money, thinking that maybe some day I would set up in\nthe horse business, myself--in a small way, of course.\n\n\u201cBut you know how it is. A man would be having a lot of friends, and\nwhat with the treating, and lending to them who would be forgetting to\npay back, the money went. But I kept me good clothes, sir. I have some\nof them yet. Anyhow, one day I quit me job. I\u2019ll not be telling you why,\nbut it was not the fault of me boss, and maybe not so much me own fault.\nI bought a ticket and came West. One time I would be working on a ranch,\nbut always I would be moving on. One good job I had taking care of fifty\nbrood mares and their colts. But when the man sold out, I left. I worked\nin many places, sir, and always where there were horses. But I must\nalways be moving on. Maybe it was me pride that kept me moving on. I was\nnot always a groom. Anyhow, I kept me trunkful of good clothes against\nthe day when I would have the job I was looking for. And I thought I had\nfound it when I came to this city and went to work for a man I\u2019ll not\nname, but maybe you\u2019ll be knowing who he is without that.\n\n\u201cBut it makes no difference. He gave me a string to do--mostly jumpers\nthat he was getting ready for the winter show. And there was my work,\nand I knew how to do it. It was not long before I was taking some of\nthem over the jumps, with him leaning on his cane and watching me. One\nday he called me into the office and tells me that he will be putting\nanother groom on my string, and that I will be exercising the jumpers\nand getting them ready for the winter show. And he tells me that if I\nkeep straight, I\u2019ll be riding some of them over the jumps at the show.\nIt was my chance. But it would have been better if I had never had that\nchance. You see, the man had in his stable some boarders and some school\nhorses and some show horses, five-gaited and jumpers and the like. But\nwhat he cared for most was to buy and sell. He was not so much a\nhorseman, sir, as a horse dealer, and there\u2019s a bit of a difference.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nYou see, sir, he would be buying a sick horse, or a lame one, or one\nwith a bad temper, and doctoring them and patching them up and doping\nthem till he had something that looked like a real horse. Then he would\nsell it. And he was clever at it. But it was not for me to say a word to\nanybody, although there was times when I felt like telling some nice\nyoung lady, who didn\u2019t know horses at all, at all, to buy somewhere\nelse, and not to buy something that looked pretty and went sound with a\ntrainer up, and the horse gingered and primped and too scared to show\nlame. But it was not for me to speak. My work was to condition and train\nthe jumpers, and that I did.\n\n\u201cYes, the man I speak of was clever at buying and selling. But tell me,\nsir, what dealer has not been fooled at one time or another? Now, there\nare some dealers who will buy a horse and get fooled on him, and,\nfinding it out, they will take their medicine. They are the kind that\nwill try to get rid of the horse to some other dealer who is supposed to\nknow his business. And there be dealers who would sell anything with a\nmane and tail to it, to anybody. And the man I speak of was that kind.\nAnd that is the great trouble with the horse business. Buying a bad one\nor a lame one discourages them as would spend their money, and you know,\nsir, \u2019tis the money of the amateur horseman that keeps the game going.\nAnd it is a queer game, at best. There be riders who will spoil the best\nhorse money can buy, in a week, and say that the horse is no good and\nthat they have been cheated. You have noticed, sir, that some rich\npeople, who ride because it is the fashion, are always having trouble\nwith their horses. And there be riders who will get along with most any\nkind of a horse. But money never made a rider, sir, much less a\nhorseman. The best money can do, in the way of lessons, is to make a\nnatural rider a better one. And it is a poor stick of a man that cannot\nlearn something from a horse.\n\n\u201cBut I would be telling you about the man who would be buying and\nselling, and who would cheat his best friend. In every stable you will\nfind, maybe, one or two horses that it would be best to shoot before\nthey kill some one. The man I am telling you about had one--a big\nchestnut hunter, with a blaze and one white foot. He stood close to\nsixteen hands and had good bone and muscle. His powerful hind quarters\nhad just the right drop to make him a good jumper. He was the type. I\nhave seen many like him in Ireland, but not with his temper. I would be\nthinking his sire was a thoroughbred and his dam a range mare. You see,\nhe was shipped down from Alberta, with a bunch of hunters, and sold at\nauction. The man I was working for bought him cheap.\n\n\u201cIt was not long before the horse had a bad name. He crippled one boy,\nbroke his leg, and he like to tore the shoulder off one of the grooms.\nHe was sullen, sir. There would be days when he would behave like any\ndecent animal, sir, and then, without warning, he would bite or strike\nor kick or rear and go over backward. A devil he was. But I paid little\nattention to him, being busy with my own string. And the grooms that\nknew him didn\u2019t say much. They knew the old man wanted to get rid of\nhim, and they were hoping he would, and that soon. You see, \u2019tis not so\nbad when a horse is honestly mean and shows it. But this one was sullen\nand tricky. I have seen one of the boys put him over two or three jumps\nand bring him in with never a wrong move. And I have seen him rear and\ncome over back before he was scarce out of the stable. Just tricky,\nsir.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had been working on my own string, and I was bringing in one of my\nhorses, when the old man told me to put a saddle on the blaze-face\ngelding and take him over two or three jumps. I wondered what the old\nman was up to, till I saw a young fellow with him--one of them kind that\ndresses horsy and tries to make himself believe that he has a right to\nbe wearing them kind of clothes. As I brought the gelding out, I heard\nthe old man telling the young fellow that the gelding could jump\nanything up to six feet, and that anybody who knew his business could\nhandle him. \u2018He\u2019s got plenty of life,\u2019 says the old man, \u2018but that\u2019s\nwhat you want in a jumper. Go ahead, Maurice.\u2019\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, sir, that horse took the first jump as square and clean as any\nhorse I ever sat on. I brought him back and was for taking him in before\nhe got a chance to show his meanness, when the old man told me to take\nhim over the first jump again. I was for leaving well enough alone, but\nit was not for me to say. So I turned him and put him at the jump again.\nAnd, before he got his stride, I knew that he intended to run wide or\nrefuse. And, knowing that, I forced him, and it took all I had to keep\nhim from running into the corner of the wing and crashing through. But I\ngot him over and fetched him back, him plunging and fighting his head.\n\n\u201c\u2018He\u2019s a good one,\u2019 says the old man to the young fellow. \u2018I admit it\ntakes a man to handle him.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018That don\u2019t worry me any,\u2019 says the young fellow. And then I knew he\nwas no horseman at all, at all, and that it would be plain murder to\nsell him the horse. For, by the same token, any man who could tell one\nend of a horse from the other, could see that it was all I could do to\nput him over the jump the second time, and that he intended to run blind\ninto the corner of the wing and not take off at all. I had him in the\nstable and was just turning him over to his groom, when the old man\ntells me to fetch him out again. I was afraid that the young fellow was\ngoing to try him, but it was not that. And, just as I came out, leading\nthe gelding, the bookkeeper called the old man to the telephone.\n\u2018Begging your pardon for asking,\u2019 says I to the young fellow, \u2018but was\nyou thinking of buying this horse?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018And suppose I was?\u2019 says he, and he might just as well have gone on\nand said: \u2018What business is it of yours?\u2019 It was in his eye.\n\n\u201c\u2018He\u2019s dangerous. I wouldn\u2019t buy him,\u2019 says I. And maybe I looked at the\nyoung fellow\u2019s riding breeches and new boots a bit longer than was\ncalled for.\n\n\u201c\u2018Are you afraid of him?\u2019 says he, smiling.\n\n\u201c\u2018I am,\u2019 says I. \u2018He\u2019d kill a man if he got half a chance.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe young fellow laughed in me face. I haven\u2019t much use for the opinion\nof a man who would knock his employer\u2019s business,\u2019 says he. It was a\nqueer way of thanking me for trying to save his neck. And, what with\nhandling the horse and the young fellow\u2019s talk, and how the old man was\nwilling to chance having me break my neck, showing a devil to a buyer, I\ngot hot in the collar. I had it in mind to say more to the young fellow,\nbut the old man came from the office and walked up, swinging his cane.\nThe young fellow takes out a cigarette and lights it. \u2018I\u2019ll buy him,\u2019\nsays he, \u2018if your man will put him over that jump again.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018All right,\u2019 says the old man. \u2018Take him over, Maurice.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2019I was thinking of the show coming on, and the other jumpers,\u2019 says I.\n\n\u201c\u2018That\u2019s my business,\u2019 says the old man. \u2018If you haven\u2019t nerve enough to\nput a real jumper over that jump, you can\u2019t show any of my horses.\u2019\n\n\u201cNow, the grooms had all come out and were standing by the doorway,\nwatching us, and maybe expecting to see somebody get hurt. And it was\nthe first time in me life, sir, that anybody had ever said to me that I\ndidn\u2019t have nerve enough to take a horse over a jump. \u2019Twas a black rage\nthat took hold of me. \u2018No man has ever said the like to me,\u2019 says I. And\nI mounted and took the horse down the field and turned him. When he\nlunged out and went toward the jump, I knew that I had lost my judgment\nof distance and stride, and more, that I didn\u2019t care. I was as blind mad\nas the horse himself. I fought him up to the wings, and I tried to hold\nhim straight, him rearing and lunging. But no living man could have held\nhim to the jump. He went into the corner. He didn\u2019t even try to take\noff. They told me he turned over twice. I knew nothing about that. I was\ndown and under him.\u201d\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nMaurice shrugged his shoulders. The ghost of a smile twitched at the\ncorners of his mouth.\n\n\u201cWe all get it, sir, sooner or later. Of course, I have seen some of the\nboys that got hurted bad ride again, but they would have to have the\nliquor to do it. Their nerve was gone. And that is a terrible thing to\nhappen to a man. But it was not nerve that made me put that horse at\nthat jump. It was pride. I knew better. I should have refused to take\nhim over. \u2019Twas plain reckless, and \u2019tis no credit to a man to be\nreckless, for then he has no judgment. If he comes through, \u2019tis luck\nthat does it. And, sir, I had plenty of time to think about it all, on\nme back in the hospital. It was close to six months before they let me\ngo. And me being a stranger in this city, never a soul came to see me,\nsaving a young man who was riding master at the stable, a boy from\nIreland, like meself.\n\n\u201cHe would be bringing me a package of tobacco, or maybe some fruit, or a\nbit of a book to read, and telling me a joke or two to pass the time.\nAnd when I was to leave the hospital, he put some money in me hand, and\nsays the boys at the stable had took up a collection to pay me hospital\nbill. You see, sir, grooms and stablemen and trainers will always be\nhelping one another, when a man is sick or hurted bad. And many the\ndollar that is give outright, and many is the dollar lent and by the\nsame token never paid back. But, then, sir, the fellow that will borrow\nand not pay back will be helping some other fellow, so it is all in the\nfamily, like. But the old man, who had money, he never came to see me\nonce. But one day a lawyer came and told me I could sue the old man for\ndamages.\n\n\u201cThe lawyer would be asking me to sign a paper, saying he would take the\ncase for half when we got out of it. But I did not like his talk, and I\nsigned no paper. I told him it was me own fault that I got hurted, and\nthat I knew the horse was bad, and the chance I took. It was a long time\nafter that I found out the old man sent the lawyer to see what I\nintended to do about it. A trick of the trade, sir. But I signed no\npaper. I would not be blaming the old man. He knew the horse was bad,\nbut also he knew I would be knowing it meself. They say there is some\ngood comes out of everything. I don\u2019t know. But maybe my getting broke\nup saved that young fellow from getting killed complete. If so, I am\nglad. But I paid a terrible price for saving him, sir. Look at me hands!\nSometimes I look at them and wonder if they belong to some old man with\nthe palsy. And I am not an old man, sir. Ah, well, \u2019tis all in the way\nof our business. I\u2019ll always be with the horses. \u2019Tis in me blood. I was\nborn and raised to it, in Ireland, and me father before me.\u201d\n\nOne of the grooms came back from supper. Maurice got up stiffly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be getting a bite to eat,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut the mare,\u201d I said, as we walked across the quadrangle; \u201cthere\u2019s\nnothing mean about her. She\u2019s just young and lively. You can\u2019t blame her\nfor wanting to play.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, she is not mean,\u201d said Maurice deliberately. \u201c\u2019Tis not that. I got\nto thinking, sir, why take any risk at all? You see, it is not just\nyourself--you have a family. With me it would be different. I have no\none. I was paid for riding. It was my business. But you ride for\npleasure. You are your own boss. You do not have to take any chances.\u201d\n\n\u201cChances? Why, Maurice, I take a longer chance driving my car from here\nto my home, through this town, than I do when riding the mare.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt may be so, sir. They do be smashing up cars and people something\nwicked. \u2019Tis hard to say what a man should do to keep his bones whole.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just it,\u201d I said. \u201cWhere can we draw the line? Why, a man isn\u2019t\nsafe, even in jail. There might be an earthquake. But we were talking\nabout the mare. I am going to let you make a decision. I\u2019ll stand by it.\nIf you were in my place would you keep on riding the mare, or would you\nride a deadhead and try to make yourself believe you enjoyed it?\u201d\n\n\u201cDeadhead, is it? There are no deadheads in this stable.\u201d Maurice\u2019s tone\nwas brusque, but he smiled instantly. \u201cAnd the others--well, I would be\nthinking the mare is the best of the lot. I will have her ready for you\nat the same time to-morrow, sir.\u201d",
