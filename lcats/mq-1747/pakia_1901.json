    "body": "C. Arthur Pearson Ltd.\n\n1901\n\nLate one evening, when the native village was wrapped in slumber, Temana\nand I brought our sleeping-mats down to the boat-shed, and spread them\nupon the white, clinking sand. For here, out upon the open beach, we\ncould feel a breath of the cooling sea-breeze, denied to the village\nhouses by reason of the thick belt of palms which encompassed them on\nthree sides. And then we were away from Malepa's baby, which was a good\nthing in itself.\n\nTemana, tall, smooth-limbed, and brown-skinned, was an excellent savage,\nand mine own good friend. He and his wife Malepa lived with me as a sort\nof foster-father and mother, though their united ages did not reach mine\nby a year or two.\n\nWhen Malepa's first baby was born, she and her youthful husband\napologised sincerely for the offence against my comfort, and with many\ntears prepared to leave my service. But although I was agreeable to let\nMalepa and her little bundle of red-skinned wrinkles go, I could not\npart with Temana, so I bade her stay. She promised not to let the baby\ncry o' nights. Poor soul. She tried her best; but every night--or rather\ntowards daylight--that terrible infant would raise its fearsome voice,\nand wail like a foghorn in mortal agony.\n\nWe lit our pipes and lay back watching a moon of silvered steel poised\n'midships in a cloudless sky. Before us, unbroken in its wide expanse,\nsave for two miniature islets near the eastern horn of the encircling\nreef, the glassy surface of the sleeping lagoon was beginning to quiver\nand throb to the muffled call of the outer ocean; for the tide was about\nto turn, and soon the brimming waters would sink inch by inch, and\nfoot by foot from the hard, white sand, and with strange swirlings and\nbubblings and mighty eddyings go tearing through the narrow passage at\neight knots an hour.\n\nPresently we heard a footfall upon the path which led to the boat-shed,\nand then an old man, naked but for his _titi_, or waist-girdle of grass,\ncame out into the moonlight, and greeted us in a quavering, cracked\nvoice.\n\n\"_Aue!_ white man, my dear friend. So thou and Temana sit here in the\nmoonlight!\"\n\n\"Even so, Pakfa, most excellent and good old man. Sit ye here beside us.\nNay, not there, but here on mine own mat. So. Hast thy pipe with thee?\"\n\nThe ancient chuckled, and his wrinkled old face beamed as he untwisted a\nblack and stumpy clay from his perforated and pendulous ear-lobe, which\nhung full down upon his shoulder, and, turning it upside down, tapped\nthe palm of his left hand with it.\n\n\"See!\" he said, with another wheezing, half-whispered, half-strangled\nlaugh, \"see and hear the emptiness thereof! Nothing has been in its\nbelly since cockcrow. And until now have I hungered for a smoke. Twice\ndid I think to come to thee to-day and ask thee for _kaitalafu_ (credit)\nfor five sticks of tobacco, but I said to my pipe, 'Nay, let us wait\ntill night time.' For see, friend of my heart, there are ever greedy\neyes which watch the coming and going of a poor old man; and had I\ngotten the good God-given tobacco from thee by daylight, friends would\narise all around me as I passed through the village to my house. And\nthen, lo, the five sticks would become but one!\"\n\n\"Pakia,\" I said in English, as I gave him a piece of tobacco and my\nknife, \"you are a philosopher.\"\n\nHe stopped suddenly, and placing one hand on my knee, looked wistfully\ninto my face, as an inquiring child looks into the eyes of its mother.\n\n\"Tell me, what is that?\"\n\nI tried to find a synonym. \"It means that you are a _tagata poto_--a\nwise man.\"\n\nThe old, brown, bald head nodded, and the dark, merry eyes danced.\n\n\"Aye, aye. Old I may be, and useless, but I have lived--I have lived.\nAnd though when I am dead my children and grandchildren will make a\n_tagi_ over me, I shall laugh, for I know that of one hundred tears,\nninety and nine will be for the tobacco and the biscuit and the rice\nthat with me will vanish!\"\n\nHe filled and lit his pipe, and then, raising one skinny, tattooed arm,\npointed to the moon.\n\n\"Hast such a moon as that in _papalagi_ land?\"\n\n\"Sometimes.\"\n\n\"Aye, sometimes. But not always. No, not always. I know, I know. See, my\nfriend; let us talk. I am full of talk to-night. You are a good man, and\nI, old Pakfa, have seen many things. Aye, many things and many lands.\nAye, I, who am now old and toothless, and without oil in my knees and my\nelbows, can talk to you in two tongues besides my own.... Temana!\"\n\n\"_Oi_, good father Pakia.\"\n\n\"Go away. The white man and I would talk.\"\n\nI placed my hand on the bald head of the ancient \"Temana shall go to the\nhouse and bring us a bottle of grog. We will drink, and then you shall\ntalk. I am one who would learn.\"\n\nThe old man took my hand and patted it \"Yes, let us talk to-night And\nlet us drink grog. Grog is good to drink, sometimes. Sometimes it is\nbad to drink. It is bad to drink when the swift blood of youth is in our\nveins and a hot word calls to a sharp knife. Ah! I have seen it! Listen!\nDost hear the rush of the lagoon waters through the passage? That is the\nquick, hot blood of youth, when it is stirred by grog and passion, and\nthe soft touch of a woman's bosom. I know it I know it. But let Temana\nbring the bottle. I am not afraid to drink grog with _thee_, Ah, thou\nart not like some white men. Thou can'st drink, and give some to a poor\nold man, and if prying eyes and babbling tongues make mischief, and the\nmissionary sends thee a _tusi_ (letter), and says 'This drinking of grog\nby Pakia is wrong,' thou sendest him a letter, saying, 'True, O teacher\nof the Gospel. This drinking of grog is very wrong. Wherefore do I send\nthee three dollars for the school, and ask thy mercy for old Pakfa, who\nwas my guest.'\"\n\nI slapped the ancient on his withered old back.\n\n\"To-night ye shall drink as much grog as ye like, Pakfa. The missionary\nis a good man, and will not heed foolish talk.\"\n\nPakfa shook his head. \"Mareko is a Samoan. He thinketh much of himself\nbecause he hath been to Sini (Sydney) and stood before many white\ngentlemen and ladies, and told them about these islands. He is a vain\nfool, though a great man here in Nukufetau, but in Livapoola{*} he would\nbe but as a pig. Livapoola is a very beautiful place, full of beautiful\nwomen. Ah! you laugh.... I am bent and old now, and my bones rattle\nunder my skin like pebbles in a gourd. Then I was young and strong.\nListen! I was a boat-steerer for three years on a London whaleship. I\nhave fought in the wars of Chile and Peru. I can tell you many things,\nand you will understand.... I have seen many lands.\"\n\nTemana returned with a bottle of brandy, a gourd of water, and three\ncups.\n\n\"Drink this, Pakfa, _taka ta-ina_{**} And talk. Your talk is good to\nhear. And I can understand.\"\n\n     * Liverpool.\n\n     **Lit, dear crony.\n\nHe drank the liquor neat, and then washed it down with a cupful of\nwater.\n\n\"_Tapa!_ Ah, the good, sweet grog! And see, above us is the round moon,\nand here be we three. We three--two young and strong, one whose blood\nis getting cold. Ah, I will talk, and this boy, Temana, will learn that\nPakia is no boasting old liar, but a true man.\" Then, suddenly dropping\nthe Nukufetau dialect in which he had hitherto spoken, he said quietly\nin English--\n\n\"I told you I could speak other languages beside my own. It is true, for\nI can talk English and Spanish.\" Then he went back into native: \"But\nI am not a vain old man. These people here are fools. They think that\nbecause on Sundays they dress like white men and go to church five times\nin one day, and can read and write in Samoan, that they are as clever\nas white men. Bah! they are fools, fools! Where are the strong men of my\nyouth? Where are the thousand and two hundred people who, when my father\nwas a boy, lived upon the shores of this lagoon? They are gone, gone!\"\n\n\"True, Pakfa. They are gone.\"\n\n\"Aye, they are perished like the dead leaves. And once when I said in\nthe hearing of the _kaupule_ (head men) that in the days of the _po-uri_\n(heathen times) we were a great people and better off than we are now, I\nwas beaten by my own grand-daughter, and fined ten dollars for speaking\nof such things, and made to work on the road for two months. But it is\ntrue--it is true. Where are the people now? They are dead, perished;\nthere are now but three hundred left of the thousand and two hundred who\nlived in my father's time. And of those that are left, what are they?\nThey are weak and eaten up with strange diseases. The men cannot hunt\nand fish as men hunted and fished in my father's time.\n\n\"_Tah!_ they are women, and the women are men, for now the man must work\nfor the woman, so that she can buy hats and boots and calicoes, and\ndress like a white woman. Give me more grog, for these things fill my\nbelly with bitterness, and the grog is sweet. Ah! I shall tell you many\nthings to-night.\"\n\n\"Tell me of them, old man. See, the moon is warm to our skins. And as we\ndrink, we shall eat. Temana here shall bring us food. And we shall talk\ntill the sun shines over the tops of the trees on Motu Luga. I\nwould learn of the old times before this island became _lotu_\n(Christianised).\"\n\n\"_Oi._ I will tell you. I am now but as an old, upturned canoe that is\nused for a sitting-place for children who play on the beach at night.\nAnd I am called a fool and a bad man, because I sometimes speak of the\ndays that are dead. Temana, is Malepa thy wife virtuous?\"\n\n\"_Se kau iloa_\" (\"I do not know\"), replied Temana, with a solemn face.\n\n\"Ah, you cannot tell! Who can tell nowadays? But you will know when some\nday she is fined five dollars. In my time if a man doubted his wife, the\nclub fell swiftly, or the spear was sped, and she was dead. And, because\nof this custom, wives in those days were careful. Now, they care not,\nand are fined five dollars many times. And the husband hath to pay the\nfine!\" He laughed in his noiseless way, and then puffed at his pipe.\n\"And if he cannot pay, then he and his wife, and the man who hath\nwronged him, work together on the roads, and eat and drink together\nas friends, and are not ashamed. And at night-time they sing hymns\ntogether!\"\n\n\"People must be punished when wrong is done, Pakia,\" I said lamely.\n\n\"Bah! what is five dollars to a woman? Is it a high fence set with\nspears over which she cannot climb? If a man hath fifty dollars, does\nnot his wife know it, and tell her lover (if she hath one) that he may\nmeet her ten times! Give me more water in this grog, good white man with\nthe brown skin like mine own!\"\n\nThe old fellow smoked his pipe in silence for a few minutes; then again\nhe pointed to the moon, nodded and smiled.\n\n\"_Tah!_ What a moon! Would that I were young again! See, in the days of\nmy youth, on such a night as this, all the young men and women would be\nstanding on the outer reef fishing for _malau_, which do but take a bait\nin the moonlight. _Now_, because to-morrow is the Sabbath day, no man\nmust launch a canoe nor take a rod in his hand, lest he stay out beyond\nthe hour of midnight, and his soul go to hell to burn in red fire for\never and ever. Bah!\"\n\n\"Never mind these things, Pakia. Tell me instead how came ye to serve\nin the wars of Chile and Peru, or of thy voyages in the _folau manu_\n(whaleship).\"\n\nHis eyes sparkled. \"Ah, those were the days! Twice in one whaleship did\nI sail among the ice mountains of the far south, where the wind cuts\nlike a knife and the sea is black to look at _Tapa!_ the cold, the\ncold, the cold which burneth the skin like iron at white heat! But I\nwas strong; and we killed many whales. I, Pakfa, in one voyage struck\nthirteen! I was in the mate's boat.... Look at this now!\" He held up his\nwithered arm and peered at me. \"It was a strong arm then; now it is but\ngood to carry food to my mouth, or to hold a stick when I walk.\" The\nlast words he uttered wistfully, and then sighed.\n\n\"The mate of that ship was a good man. He taught me many things. Once,\nwhen we had left the cold seas and were among the islands of Tonga,\nhe struck me in his rage because I threw the harpoon at a great sperm\nwhale, and missed. That night I slipped over the side, and swam five\nmiles to the land. Dost know the place called Lifuka? 'Twas there I\nlanded. I lay in a thicket till daylight, then I arose and went into a\nhouse and asked for food. They gave me a yam and a piece of bonito, and\nas I ate men sprang on me from behind and tied me up hand and foot.\nThen I was carried back to the ship, and the captain gave those pigs of\nTongans fifty dollars' worth of presents for bringing me back.\"\n\n\"He thought well of thee, Pakia, to pay so much.\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Aye, for I was a good man, and worth much to him. And I was not\nflogged, for the mate was my friend always. All the voyage I was a lucky\nman, till we came to a place called Amboyna. Here the mate became sick\nand died, so I ran away. This time I was not caught, and when the ship\nwas gone, I was given work by an Englishman. He was a rich merchant--not\na poor trader like thee. He had a great house, many servants, and many\nnative wives. Thou hast but two servants, and no wife. Why have ye no\nwife? It is not proper!\"\n\nI expressed my deep sense of the insignificance of my domestic\narrangements, and gave him another nip of brandy.\n\n\"But, like him, thou hast a big heart. May you live long and become a\n_mau koloa_ (rich man). Ah! the grog, the good grog. I am young again\nto-night... And so for two years I lived at Amboyna. Then my master went\nto Peretania--to Livapoola--and took me with him. I was his servant, and\nhe trusted me and made much of me.\n\n\"Ah, Livapoola is a fine place. I was six months there, and wherever my\nmaster went I went with him. By and by he married, and we went to live\nat a place by the sea, in a fair white house of stone, with rich lands\nencompassing it. It was a foreign place, and we crossed the sea to go\nthere. There were many women servants there, and one of them, named\nLissi, began to smile at, and then to talk to me. I gave her many\npresents, for every week my master put a gold piece in my hand. One day\nI asked him to give me this girl for my wife. He laughed, and said I was\nfoolish; that she was playing with me. I told her this. She swore to me\nthat when I had fifty gold pieces she would be my wife, but that I must\ntell no one.... Ah! how a woman can fool a man! I was fooled. And every\ngold piece I got I gave to her to keep for me.\n\n\"I have said that there were many servants. There was one young man,\nnamed Harry, whose work it was to take my master about in his _puha tia\ntia_ (carriage). Sometimes I would see him talking to the girl, and then\nlooking at me. Then I began to watch; but she was too cunning. Always\nhad she one word for me. Be patient; when we have the fifty gold pieces\nall shall be well. We shall go away from here, and get married.'\n\n\"One night, as I lay upon the grass, smoking my pipe, I heard voices,\nthe voices of the man Harry and Lissi. They were speaking of me. They\nspoke loudly, and I heard all that was said. 'He is but a simple fool,'\nshe said, with a laugh; 'but in another month I shall have the last\nof his money, and then thou and I shall go away quietly. Faugh! the\ntattooed beast!' and I heard her laugh again, and the man laughed with\nher, but bade her be careful lest I should suspect.\"\n\n\"She was a bad woman, Pakfa,\" I began, when he interrupted me with a\nquick gesture.\n\n\"I crept back into the house and got a knife, and waited. The night was\ndark, but I could see. Presently they came along a narrow path which led\nto the house. Then I sprang out, and drove my knife twice into the man's\nchest. I had not time to kill the woman, for at the third blow the knife\nbroke off at the hilt, and she fled in the darkness. I wanted to kill\nher because she had fooled me and taken my money--forty-six gold pieces.\n\n\"There was a great wood which ran from my master's house down to the\nsea. I ran hard, very hard, till I came to the water. I could see ships\nin the harbour, quite near. I swam to one, and tried to creep on deck\nand hide, but heard the sailors talking. Presently I saw a vessel--a\nschooner--come sailing slowly past. There was a boat towing astern. I\nswam softly over, and got into the boat, and laid down till it was near\nthe dawn. There was but little wind then, and the ship was not moving\nfast, so I got into the water again, and held on to the side of the\nboat, and began to cry out in a loud voice for help. As soon as they\nheard me the ship was brought to the wind, and I got back into the boat\nI was taken on board and given food and coffee, and told the captain\nthat I had fallen overboard from another ship, and had been swimming\nfor many hours. Only the captain could speak a little English--all the\nothers were Italians. It was an Italian ship.\n\n\"I was a long time on that ship. We went first to Rio, then down to the\ncold seas of the south, and then to Callao. But the captain never gave\nme any money, so I ran away. Why should a man work for naught? By and by\nan American whaleship came to Callao, and I went on board. I was put in\nthe captain's boat. We sailed about a long time, but saw no whales, so\nwhen the ship came to Juan Fernandez I and a white sailor named Bob ran\naway, and hid in the woods till the ship was gone. Then we came out\nand went to the Governor, who set us to work to cut timber for the\nwhaleships. Hast been to this island?\"\n\n\"No,\" I replied; \"'tis a fair land, I have heard.\"\n\n\"Aye, a fair, fair land, with green woods and sweet waters; and the note\nof the blue pigeon soundeth from dawn till dark, and the wild goats leap\nfrom crag to crag.\"\n\n\"Didst stay there long, Pakia?\"\n\nHe rubbed his scanty white beard meditatively. \"A year--two years--I\ncannot tell. Time goes on and on, and the young do not count the\ndays. But there came a ship which wanted men, and I sailed away to Niu\nSilani.{*} That, too, is a fair land, and the men of the country have\nbrown skins like us, and I soon learnt their tongue, which is akin to\nours. I was a long time in that ship, for we kept about the coast, and\nthe Maoris filled her with logs of _kauri_ wood, to take to Sydney. It\nwas a good ship, for although we were paid no money every man had as\nmuch rum as he could drink and as much tobacco as he could smoke, and a\nyoung Maori girl for wife, who lived on board. Once the Maoris tried\nto take the ship as she lay at anchor, but we shot ten or more. Then we\nwent to Sydney, where I was put in prison for many weeks.\"\n\n     * New Zealand\n\n\"Why was that?\"\n\n\"I do not know. It was, I think, because of something the captain had\ndone when he was in Sydney before; he had taken away two men and a\nwoman who were prisoners of the Governor had seen them on board at Juan\nFernandez; they went ashore there to live. But the Governor of Sydney\nwas good to me. I was brought before him; he asked me many questions\nabout these islands, and gave me some silver money. Then the next day I\nwas put on board a ship, which took me to Tahiti. But see, dear friend,\nI cannot talk more to-night, though my tongue is loose and my belly warm\nwith the good grog. But it is strong, very strong, and I fear to drink\nmore, lest I disgust thee and lose thy friendship.\"\n\n\"Nay, old man. Have no fear of that. And see, sleep here with us till\nthe dawn. Temana shall bring thee a covering-mat.\"\n\n\"Ah-h-h! Thou art good to old Pakfa. I shall stay till the dawn. It is\ngood to have such a friend. To-morrow, if I weary thee not, I shall tell\nthee of how I returned to Chile and fought with the English ship-captain\nin the war, and of the woman he loved, and of the great fire which burnt\ntwo thousand women in a church.\"\n\n\"_Tah!_\" said Temana incredulously; \"two thousand?\"\n\n\"Aye!\" he snapped angrily, \"dost think I be drunk, boy? Go and watch thy\nwife. How should an ignorant hog like thee know of such things?\"\n\n\"'Sh, 'sh, old man. Be not so quick to anger. Temana meant no harm. Here\nis thy covering-mat. Lie down and sleep.\"\n\nHe smiled good-naturedly at us, and then, pulling the mat over him to\nshield his aged frame from the heavy morning dew, was soon asleep.",
