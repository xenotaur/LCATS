    "body": "It was always hot in the Bitter Water Valley, and the hills were like\nrumpled yellow and gray blankets, shimmering in the summer sun. Folks\ndidn\u2019t tan there--they simply charred. The winds were hot, even in the\nshade--when there was any wind.\n\nThe old dirt road, inches deep in dust, wound in and out among the old\nlava beds, like a long, yellow worm, with its head in the town of Calor,\nits few tails ending at the scattered ranches. The valley was not a\nsummer resort, and those who were financially able went into the far\nmountains, to escape the heat.\n\nAlong this winding, yellow road came a team and wagon, almost hidden in\na cloud of dust, which drifted up from wheel and hoof like the smoke\nfrom a foundry stack. On the seat were a man and a woman, and in the\nback of the wagon was a single trunk, already dust covered.\n\nThe woman had a scarf twisted about her mouth and nose, while the man\u2019s\nface to his eyes was covered with a bandana handkerchief; two masked\nfigures, their dusty eyes blinking, red-rimmed. Their conversation was\nlimited; had been limited for several weary miles, but now they struck a\nslight raise, where the dust was less deep.\n\n\u201cI had to do it, Joe,\u201d said the woman, as though picking up the\nconversation of an hour gone. \u201cI just had to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know it, Mrs. Deming,\u201d said the man nodding slowly. \u201cI seen it\ncomin\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe spat dryly, still nodding. \u201cI told Jim. I told him he was a fool.\nBut,\u201d resignedly, \u201cyuh can\u2019t tell him nothin\u2019. Bull-headed as hell, Jim\nis. He read me the riot act. Said fer me to mind my own business.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he\u2019ll fire you, Joe.\u201d\n\nThe man turned slowly and looked at the woman. She had removed the scarf\nnow. Mrs. Jim Deming, wife of Jim Deming, sheriff of Calor, had been a\npretty girl in her youth. She was still pretty, except that her hair was\ngray and her once smooth face was creased with deep lines. Her gray eyes\nwere clouded with sadness, as she looked at Joe Mills, her husband\u2019s\ndeputy.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nJoe was tall, thin, harsh-faced, burned to the color of a dark Indian.\nJoe Mills was as hard as the lava beds, but he had found a man harder\nthan he. Jim Deming, known as \u201cDuty\u201d Deming, was so hard that he rather\nappalled even Joe Mills.\n\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019ll fire me,\u201d agreed Joe slowly. \u201cBut that\u2019s fine, ma\u2019am. I\u2019m\nkinda sour on this county, anyway. Seems to me that I\u2019d kinda like to go\nsomewhere else, where there\u2019s green grass and lakes. I\u2019ve allus lived\nhere, yuh see. Don\u2019t you worry about me, ma\u2019am; you\u2019ve got a-plenty to\nworry about for yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Joe. I\u2019m glad you don\u2019t blame me. It had to come. He--he\nwasn\u2019t so bad until they elected him sheriff. We got along, yuh know.\nGoin\u2019 onto three years now. I--I hoped they\u2019d defeat him last election.\u201d\n\n\u201cShore. Prob\u2019ly been better if they had. But they say he\u2019s the best\nsheriff they ever had--I dunno.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause he sent my son to prison,\u201d she said painfully.\n\n\u201cYeah. It was his son, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoe, you know Harry wasn\u2019t a thief, don\u2019t yuh?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t reckon he was. The JB outfit started out to git Harry--and they\ngot him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis own father got him, you mean!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Deming. \u201cJim was\nalone when he found that evidence at Harry\u2019s place. It was nothing but a\nJB hide. Jim could have buried it and warned Harry. That hide was\nplanted there by the JB. But Jim took the evidence and arrested Harry.\nTen years! It was Jim\u2019s evidence that sent my boy to the penitentiary.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he sent Al Seymour up for stealing a horse, which he didn\u2019t steal.\nAl was drunk that night and got the wrong one. It was wrong for him to\nget drunk, I know; but he didn\u2019t intend to take the wrong horse. Jim\nknew it. Oh, yes, he did. But he went straight out and arrested Al,\ninstead of bringing the horse back. He could have explained it all. Al\nwas no thief.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was going to marry Jane, wasn\u2019t he, Mrs. Deming?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. It broke her heart, Joe. I\u2019m going to her now. Oh, I\u2019ve pleaded\nwith Jim; talked and pleaded until my throat was raw. But what\u2019s the\nuse? He defends himself by saying that he swore to uphold the law, and\nboth Harry and Al broke the law. His duty to the law! He sits in\njudgment on this whole desert; brags about his iron hand. Oh, it\u2019s iron,\nall right. It smashed his home; it will smash him, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno; he\u2019s pretty hard, ma\u2019am. I never knowed a man as hard as Jim,\nand I\u2019ve knowed a lot of hard ones. His job is a religion with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some day it will raise up and kill him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis star is his god,\u201d said the deputy slowly.\n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t the Bible say something about thou shalt have no other gods\nbefore me?\u201d\n\n\u201cMebbe. I dunno much about the Bible. I don\u2019t reckon that God operates\nmuch around here--it\u2019s too hot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve wondered about it,\u201d she said, wearily. \u201cI\u2019ve prayed a lot, Joe;\nbut nothing came of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo hot, Mrs. Deming. I don\u2019t reckon a fried prayer ever got any\nfurther than a fried aig. Mebbe not as far, because yuh can eat the aig.\nWell, there\u2019s the town. Yuh\u2019ve got plenty time, \u2019cause the train ain\u2019t\nnever on time. Lotsa folks would miss the train if it ever came on\ntime.\u201d\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe train was of the mixed variety, half passenger, half freight; a\nbranch line train, using something like seven hours to complete the\nsixty mile run from Santa Leone to Levering, which was twenty miles\nsouth of Calor.\n\nCalor was the usual desert type of town. Perhaps a little larger, due to\nthe fact that it was a county seat, but the buildings were unpainted,\nscourged by wind and sand, until they blended nicely with the gray of\nthe desert. Two huge water tanks, thrusting their ungainly bulk upward\non their scaffolding, like huge, rotund giants, with spindling legs,\nsupplied the town with water, which was always warm.\n\nThe depot had once been painted a bright red, but time had dimmed its\nluster until it was a sickly pink, where any color yet remained.\n\nThe team came up to the depot platform, guided in close to the high\nplatform. The deputy helped the woman down, and unloaded the trunk. He\ntied both horses securely to the platform, because they were unused to\ntrains, and then began twisting the trunk around to the front, the woman\nfollowing him.\n\nThe telegraph wires hummed in the hot wind, and there was a strong odor\nof pitch frying up from the planks of the platform. A man stood near the\ndoorway to the waiting room; a tall, lean figure of a man, harsh of\nfeature, his gray eyes deep set under beetling brows, and separated with\na high-arched nose. His mouth was wide and thin lipped.\n\nIn raiment he was practically the same as ninety-nine per cent of the\ndesert men; well-worn sombrero, colorless shirt, stringy vest, overalls,\nfrom which the color had long since fled, tucked in the tops of\nhigh-heeled boots. Around his lean waist hung a belt and holstered gun,\nand on the lapel of his vest gleamed the insignia of office. Such was\nDuty Deming, sheriff of Calor.\n\nHe shot one sharp glance at his deputy, who handled the trunk awkwardly\nas he rolled it out near the edge of the platform. The woman stopped\nshort and studied the face of her husband.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t think I\u2019d come, did you?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t be up here,\u201d he said slowly.\n\nThe deputy walked from the trunk to the waiting room. He had Mrs.\nDeming\u2019s ticket, and was going to check the trunk. The sheriff\u2019s eyes\nfollowed him.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to blame Joe,\u201d she said.\n\nHis eyes shifted from the doorway and came back to her.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not sorry?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cWhat for? I\u2019ve got nothing to be sorry about.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter thirty years, Jim?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. You said you\u2019d go away. I\u2019ve provided for yuh all these years,\nand----\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd sent my son to prison; drove my daughter away.\u201d\n\nHis jaw set grimly for a moment. \u201cWell?\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s all, Jim.\u201d\n\nThey were silent now. Came the soft humming of the rails, as the train\ncame creeping through the desert. The telegraph instrument in the office\nclanked spasmodically.\n\n\u201cThey call you Duty,\u201d she said bitterly. \u201cAnd you\u2019re proud of it. You\nthink more of that than you do of your family. Your evidence ruined the\nhappiness of your daughter; your evidence ruined my happiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI swore to do my duty,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cI raised my right hand and\nswore to uphold the law. It doesn\u2019t mean that an officer can be lenient\nto _anybody_. I\u2019ve been the best sheriff this county ever had, and I\u2019ll\nkeep on bein\u2019 the best sheriff. The voters put their trust----\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard all that, Jim. I\u2019m going away now; going to be gone forever.\nI\u2019ll never come back to the desert--to you. You\u2019ve made a god of your\njob, Jim. Maybe they\u2019ll put up a monument to you some day.\u201d\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe train whistled shrilly, as it came into view. The deputy came out\nand gave Mrs. Deming her ticket and her trunk check.\n\n\u201cThank you, Joe,\u201d she said, holding out her hand. They shook hands, and\nshe turned her back on her husband, watching the train come in. There\nwere only a few people at the station. The engine clanked past and the\ntrain ground to a stop. The sheriff\u2019s eyes were looking down the train,\nand without a word he walked away from his wife and strode down the\nplatform.\n\nShe looked curiously after him, but he did not look back. So this was\nhis good-by. Stifling a sob she climbed up the steps of the coach and\nwent inside, while the agent\u2019s helper threw her trunk in the baggage\ncar.\n\nDuty Deming walked down to a box-car and hunched on his heels, speaking\nto a man who clung to the rods beneath the car.\n\n\u201cCome out of that,\u201d he ordered gruffly.\n\nThe man slowly edged off the rods and almost fell headlong. His legs\nwere cramped from the uncomfortable position, and he was black with dirt\nand sand; his clothes driven full of it.\n\n\u201cStealin\u2019 a ride, eh?\u201d grunted the sheriff.\n\nThe hobo straightened up, looked around through bloodshot eyes, which\nfinally came back to the sheriff. The train was moving again.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the big idea?\u201d asked the hobo hoarsely. \u201cWhat right have you to\ndrag me off here? You\u2019re just a hick sheriff and this is a little town.\nI was just travelin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cStealin\u2019 a ride,\u201d said the sheriff grimly. He did not look up as the\ncoaches passed him. \u201cYou know it\u2019s agin the law, young man.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s up to the railroad company. Or do you own this particular\nbranch?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t own the railroad,\u201d replied the sheriff harshly, \u201cbut I do\nrepresent the law around here.\u201d\n\n\u201cRepresent it, eh?\u201d\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe hobo sighed deeply and looked at the passing coaches. The sheriff\ndid not look at them.\n\n\u201cHot ridin\u2019 under there,\u201d said the hobo. \u201cI was just heading out of this\ncountry. Tough riding, I\u2019ll tell you; but they had all them box-cars\nsealed. Still, I could have made it to Levering.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yuh didn\u2019t!\u201d snapped the sheriff.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true. Still, you haven\u2019t any rock pile. All you can do is to put\nme in jail and feed me. That\u2019s not a profitable thing. Better let me sit\nhere in the shade, until the next train comes along.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd let you steal another ride, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you care, as long as you don\u2019t own the railroad?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m paid to uphold the law,\u201d said the sheriff stiffly.\n\nThe hobo sighed wearily, as he scraped his heel against the cinders.\n\n\u201cDo you always uphold the law?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways--that\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\u201d\n\n\u201cA little authority has made you your brother\u2019s keeper, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the sheriff.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I can see that. But what right have you to haul me off that train?\nIt isn\u2019t your train. You\u2019re not paid to guard that train, are you? Don\u2019t\nshove me. Can\u2019t you see I\u2019m a sick man?\u201d\n\n\u201cSick man!\u201d sneered the sheriff. \u201cSick because I\u2019m goin\u2019 to lock yuh up\nfor a few days. Don\u2019t play \u2019possum with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not playing \u2019possum, as you say; I\u2019m sick.\u201d\n\nThe man really looked sick, in spite of his grimy face, but the sheriff\ntwisted him around by the shoulder and started him toward the jail.\nSeveral persons, including the deputy, waited on the depot platform to\nsee what the sheriff was going to do, and as the sheriff marched his\nprisoner past them he told the deputy to come with him.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe deputy followed down to the jail, where the hobo was locked behind\nthe bars. The deputy made no comment, but followed the sheriff back to\nthe office, where they sat down.\n\n\u201cSaid he was sick,\u201d remarked the sheriff disgustedly.\n\n\u201cLooked sick,\u201d said the deputy wearily, fanning himself with his\nsombrero.\n\nThe sheriff studied the lean face of his deputy for a length of time.\n\u201cHow did you happen to bring the old lady in today, Joe?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cShe asked me to. I came past the ranch. I told her I\u2019d take the team\nback and get my horse. She was comin\u2019, anyway,\u201d as though to defend his\nposition in the matter.\n\n\u201cShe was, eh? You never stopped to think that you were workin\u2019 for me,\ndid yuh? You waste a day, bringin\u2019 her in, and waste another day in\ngoin\u2019 back with that team. Do you think I\u2019m payin\u2019 you to use up time\nthat way?\u201d\n\nThe deputy flushed slightly and his lips tightened.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that _you_ paid me anythin\u2019, Deming. Ain\u2019t I paid by the\ncounty?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m part of that county, Joe; the sheriff part of it. I hired yuh,\ndidn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nThe deputy got slowly from his chair and put on his hat.\n\n\u201cYou hired me, Deming, but I\u2019ll be damned if you fire me; I quit right\nnow.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right; suit yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI intend to, Deming. In fact, I intended to quit yuh when I came down\nhere. You never even told yore wife good-by; just walked away to arrest\na hobo, who wasn\u2019t doin\u2019 you any harm. Yo\u2019re plumb loco over duty, ain\u2019t\nyuh? I\u2019m scared of yuh, Jim; honest, I am. Yore wife said you was\nworshippin\u2019 that tin god on yore vest; that sheriff\u2019s star. I reckon yuh\nare.\n\n\u201cShe said somethin\u2019 about it raisin\u2019 up and killin\u2019 yuh. Said somethin\u2019\nabout what the Bible said about not havin\u2019 wrong gods. I don\u2019t sabe just\nwhat she meant. But I do sabe how she feels toward yuh. Deming, you\u2019ve\ngone crazy over duty to the law. It\u2019s all right to enforce the law, but\nyo\u2019re just a damn\u2019 fool over it. I knowed you was crazy when yuh sent\nHarry to the pen. You didn\u2019t need to do it, and you know yuh didn\u2019t. Oh,\nI\u2019m glad I quit yuh.\u201d\n\nDeming\u2019s face flushed hotly and he started to rise from his chair, but\nsank back heavily, a queer expression in his hard gray eyes.\n\n\u201cWhat did she mean by sayin\u2019 that it would rise up and kill me?\u201d he\ndemanded. \u201cThat\u2019s fool talk; women\u2019s talk. Nobody can scare me. I\u2019m glad\nyuh quit, if yuh feel the way yuh do about me--and yore job. You didn\u2019t\nalways fulfill yore oath, Joe. Mebbe it\u2019s best that yuh did quit. I\u2019m\ngoin\u2019 to be more particular in the next deputy I hire.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll probably be, too,\u201d said Joe. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a hell of a time,\nhirin\u2019 a new man, \u2019cause everybody knows how hard yuh are, Deming. Well,\nI\u2019ll pack my stuff and get out.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, Joe; give me your star. And them ca\u2019tridges in yore belt\nbelong to the county.\u201d\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nSeveral days passed in which Deming was obliged to run the office alone,\nwhich meant that twice a day he must carry food to his prisoner, against\nwhom no formal complaint had been made. But the hobo was far too ill to\ncare whether he had food or freedom. He spent most of the time on his\ncot, talking deliriously, and in the dim light of the little cell the\nsheriff could see nothing wrong with the man, except a fever.\n\nBut finally he called in the doctor, who was also the coroner, and he\nimmediately pronounced it a malignant case of smallpox; quarantining the\njail. He was minded to quarantine the sheriff, but while he was making\nup his mind just what to do a cowboy, Slim Delong, fairly tore up the\nstreet of Calor, bringing news of a murder.\n\nDelong was fairly incoherent. Red Cowan, another cowboy working for the\nJB outfit, had murdered Al Mitchell, owner of the outfit, and had headed\nfor the lava beds. Delong, riding in at the ranch, had seen Red Cowan\nriding away swiftly toward the lava bed country, and a few minutes later\nhe had found Mitchell lying on the front porch, shot through the heart.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nMitchell was a big cattleman in that part of the country, and the\nsheriff\u2019s son had been sent to the penitentiary for stealing Mitchell\u2019s\ncattle. The town was rather in an uproar over the murder, but the\nsheriff did not ask any of the cowboys to ride with him.\n\nHe saddled his roan horse, tied a quantity of food to his saddle, filled\na canteen and headed for the lava bed country. He did not need help. He\nknew every inch of the lava bed country, although he did not know Red\nCowan. Red had only been there a short time and he had heard Joe speak\nof meeting him at the JB.\n\nShortly after Delong had delivered his message to the sheriff, Delong\nimbibed a few drinks before starting back to the JB ranch with the\ncoroner and several others, who were going out there to bring the body\nto town. He happened to be riding a half-broke bronco, and in the flurry\nat the hitchrack, as they were starting out, Delong\u2019s horse bucked\nwickedly, throwing Delong against one of the hitchrack posts.\n\nIn the parlance of the range, it knocked Delong flatter than a snake\u2019s\nbelly, and he was unable to get on his horse; so they half carried, half\nled him back to the saloon, where they left him propped up in a chair.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sheriff did not hurry his horse. He swung in west of the JB ranch\nand headed for the lava bed country, making no attempt to pick up the\ntracks of Red\u2019s horse. He knew that Red would cut straight through the\nlava beds and head for the Mesquite River country, sixty miles away;\nsixty miles of waterless waste, a broken mass of twisted lava, which\nseemed never to have cooled since those prehistoric days, when it had\nbeen poured indiscriminately over the landscape.\n\nThe sheriff felt reasonably certain that Red Cowan had started without\nany preparations for food or water, and would probably expect, at least,\nto find water. But there was no water in that part of the country. And a\nman must ride slowly, because the sharp lava would soon ruin the feet of\nhis horse, unless the animal was allowed to make its own pace.\n\nMile after mile he plodded along, squinting his eyes against the glare\nof the sun, until he developed a queer sort of a headache; a dull throb\nin the back of his head, which caused him to wince at times. It bothered\nhis eyes. He drank from his canteen, but the water did not seem to\nquench his thirst.\n\nHis mouth felt dry a moment later; so he took another drink, which\ncaused him a slight nausea. Must be the sun, he decided. Still, the idea\ndid not seem so good, because he was used to the sun. It made him angry.\nAfter a while he filled and lighted his pipe, but after the first few\npuffs of the pungent weed, he put the pipe in his pocket.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nAhead of him stretched the interminable wastes of the lava beds, where\nthe heat devils danced before his eyes, and he cursed them aloud, as\nthough they could heed his voice. Then it seemed as though he realized\nthe utter absurdity of such things, and cursed himself.\n\nThe setting sun found the sheriff riding aimlessly. His eyes ached\ncontinuously now, and he had lost all desire to scan the country. But he\nwas not going to turn back. He was following a murderer, a cold-blooded\nkiller, and the law must be avenged.\n\nHe felt a little better when the sun went down and the short desert\ntwilight had blended with the night; a time in which the temperature\ndrops swiftly from a hundred and fifteen in the shade to sixty in the\ndark. The sheriff had ridden away without any blankets, and now he\nshivered in a sudden chill, which seemed to crinkle his vertebrae.\n\nQueer thing, that chill. It rattled his teeth like castanets and\nincreased his headache until every movement of the horse brought him\nfresh misery. So he dismounted, uncoiled his lariat and picketed his\nhorse. It was only after several minutes that he was able to summon\nenough energy to remove the saddle.\n\nDuty Deming was a sick man--and knew it. He thought of saddling his\nhorse and heading for Calor, but he had lost all sense of direction. The\nstars blurred in his eyes, and he flopped down beside his saddle,\nburying his aching head in his arms.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was possibly two hours later that the sheriff\u2019s horse nickered softly\nin the darkness, but the sheriff did not lift his head. Came the sound\nof a horse walking, and the bulky form of a horse and rider came in\nthrough the broken rocks, plainly visible by the light of the stars.\n\nThe rider drew rein near the picketed horse, as though rather surprised\nto find a horse there. He dismounted and discovered the rope, speaking\nsoftly to the horse. He turned away and soon discovered the sheriff.\n\n\u201cSleepin\u2019 kinda heavy, ain\u2019t yuh, pardner?\u201d he asked in a soft, drawling\nvoice; but the sheriff did not move.\n\nComing in closer, the man scratched a match. He was of medium height,\nthin-faced, blue-eyed, dressed in a faded blue shirt, well-worn bat-wing\nchaps, black Stetson. The light of the match glistened on the butt of a\nbig Colt in the holster swinging at his thigh. As he removed his hat to\nshield the match the light glistened on his copper-colored hair.\n\nHe was Red Cowan, the murderer. He knelt down beside the sheriff and\nshook him by the shoulder.\n\n\u201cWake up, pardner,\u201d he said softly, but the sheriff merely grunted and\nbegan mumbling deliriously.\n\n\u201cSick, eh?\u201d muttered the red headed one. \u201cFunny. Got a bad fever and\nhe\u2019s plumb loco. And it\u2019s a long ways to a doctor. Jist what\u2019ll I do\nnext?\u201d\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe squatted on his heels and rolled a cigarette. After due deliberation\nand another cigarette he saddled the sheriff\u2019s horse. The sheriff was\nnot easy to arouse but he talked steadily, mumbling his words, swearing\nand laughing foolishly, while Red Cowan swung him into the saddle and\nroped him on. He swayed forward, both arms dangling loosely, while Cowan\nmounted his own horse and picked up the lead-rope.\n\nCowan took his bearings from the North Star and started out, looking\nback at the humped figure of the sheriff, swaying in the saddle.\n\n\u201cStay with her, pardner,\u201d he grunted. \u201cWe\u2019ll make the old Alkali Spring\nranch by mornin\u2019, and mebbe we\u2019ll find somebody there.\u201d\n\nAnd all through the night they wended their way through the lava beds,\nand it was just about daybreak when they came out at an old tumbledown\nranch house. The old buildings seemed about to fall down, the corrals\nwere in bad repair, and only one fan was left on the old windmill, which\ncreaked in the morning breeze.\n\nDown by the old stable was an alkali spring, where a few cattle,\ndrifters from the herds in the Mesquite River ranges, came to drink. Red\nCowan looked them over appraisingly. They meant fresh meat.\n\nHe unroped the sheriff and lifted him to the ground, propping him\nagainst the wall while he went inside. The inside of the house was not\nas bad as the exterior, as it had been used by some cattlemen during a\nrecent roundup. There was a roll of blankets, tightly wrapped in a\ntarpaulin, swinging from a rafter, while from a tightly closed box he\ntook flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, beans and some cans of\nvegetables and fruit.\n\n\u201cThought there might be a cache here,\u201d he said, as he removed the\nprovisions.\n\nHe took down the bed-roll and spread it out on one of the bunks, before\ngoing out after the sheriff, whom he dragged in and put to bed. He\nlooped the sheriff\u2019s belt around a bunk post, removed his clothes, and\nprepared a breakfast, before attending to the horses.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sheriff was burning with fever, tossing his arms, mumbling\nincoherently all the while.\n\nAfter a breakfast, in which the sheriff did not join him, Cowan brought\na pail of the cold water to the house and proceeded to give the sheriff\na sponge bath. This treatment seemed to sooth the sick man, and he\ndropped into a slumber.\n\nCowan found an old pair of hopples, which he put on the sheriff\u2019s horse,\nand turned his own mount loose to forage. There was little to be done.\nCowan did not want to leave the sick man long enough to go after a\ndoctor, which would take at least two days; so there was only one thing\nfor him to do, and that was to stay and see it through, hoping that\nsomeone might come along and lend them a hand.\n\nFor the next three days and nights he worked with the sheriff. There\nwere no medicines of any kind, and it seemed to be a losing battle. He\nkilled a steer and made beef broth, which the sheriff could not eat,\ngave him both cold and hot baths, worked over him like a mother over a\nchild, and on the evening of the third day the sheriff awoke--conscious\nfor the first time.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter a period of deliberation he remembered starting out after Red\nCowan. Seated near the bed, his head in his hands, snoring loudly, was a\nred-headed man. The sheriff did not know any red-headed men. He was very\nweak; so he shut his eyes and tried to think. After a while he heard the\nman move, and opened his eyes.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d said the red-head wearily.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked the sheriff, and was surprised that his voice was\nso weak.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Red Cowan.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff closed his eyes quickly.\n\n\u201cI guess I don\u2019t know yuh,\u201d he said slowly.\n\n\u201cMebbe not. I was with the JB a while. What\u2019s the matter with yuh,\nanyway? You\u2019ve been here three days.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree days?\u201d The sheriff\u2019s eyes popped open.\n\nRed told him all about it.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t have no medicine,\u201d he explained. \u201cHad to do the best I could.\u201d\n\n\u201cKnow who I was?\u201d\n\n\u201cSaw yore star. Yo\u2019re Deming of Calor, ain\u2019t yuh? Yeah, I thought yuh\nwas. I\u2019ve heard of yuh. How\u2019d yuh happen to be out there in the lava\nbeds?\u201d\n\nThe sheriff closed his eyes, thinking swiftly. Cowan must not know why\nhe was out there.\n\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d he said. \u201cTook sick. Must have ridden a long ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou picketed yore horse.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I wasn\u2019t plumb out until after--just awful sick.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shore know how to be sick,\u201d grinned Cowan. \u201cDo you feel like some\neats?\u201d\n\nThe sheriff shook his head.\n\n\u201cBetter not talk any more, pardner. You\u2019ve been pretty sick, and it\nmight fever yuh up, if yuh talked much.\u201d\n\nThat suited the sheriff. He didn\u2019t want to talk; he wanted to think. His\neyes shifted to his belt and gun on the bunk-post at the head of his\nbed, and he wondered if the gun was loaded.\n\nWhen Cowan went outside he lifted a hand toward the gun, and as he did\nso he glanced at his hand. He felt of his stubby face, and a look of\nhorror spread over his face.\n\n\u201cSmallpox!\u201d he exclaimed to himself. \u201cThat\u2019s what it is--all them little\nred specks. I got it from that damn\u2019 hobo!\u201d\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nCowan came back into the house, but the sheriff did not tell him. He was\nafraid that Cowan might leave him in fear of the disease. Not exactly\nthat he felt an immediate need of Cowan, but he wanted to take Cowan\nback a prisoner.\n\n\u201cStill feelin\u2019 pretty good?\u201d asked Cowan as he busied himself around the\nstove.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel so good, Cowan.\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably not. Can\u2019t expect to. But I reckon I\u2019ve busted the fever. How\nabout a little broth, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot now.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh. Tomorrow mornin\u2019, if yo\u2019re feeling pretty good, I think I\u2019ll\nhead for Mesquite River and send some folks in to take care of yuh. You\nneed a doctor pretty bad, and you\u2019ll need the right kinda food.\u201d\n\nThat was not so good. The sheriff huddled down in bed, trying to think\nof some way to prevent Cowan from leaving. Just now his thoughts ran in\ncircles, because his head ached again. Ten minutes later he was\ndelirious again.\n\nAnd all that night Cowan had to use force to keep him in bed. He babbled\nof murderers, horse thieves and of his own prowess as a sheriff. And in\nthe light of the candle Cowan saw the rash on the sheriff\u2019s hands and\nface.\n\n\u201cSmallpox!\u201d grunted Cowan. \u201cSo that\u2019s what\u2019s the matter, eh? Lucky I\u2019ve\nhad a good dose of it. Tomorrow I\u2019ll tie him down and head for a\ndoctor.\u201d\n\nIt was daylight again before the sheriff became conscious. The fever had\nabated enough to allow him to realize and recognize again. Cowan\u2019s face\nwas drawn and tired, his eyes red from lack of sleep.\n\n\u201cSane again, eh?\u201d he grunted. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve shore been off yore nut\na-plenty, pardner. Listen to me and get this straight. I\u2019m goin\u2019 out and\nround up my bronc. You\u2019ve got a sweet case of smallpox, which means\nyo\u2019re goin\u2019 to be here mebbe a couple weeks. I can\u2019t stay all that time;\nso I\u2019m headin\u2019 for Mesquite River to get yuh a doctor and a nurse.\n\n\u201cYuh take her easy while I get my horse. Mebbe I better tie yuh down,\n\u2019cause you might go wanderin\u2019 around and die out in the desert. Anyway,\nyo\u2019re all right for a while, and I\u2019ll see yuh before I pull out. I\u2019ll\nleave plenty water, such as it is, where yuh can reach it. But you\u2019ve\ngot to have plenty nursin\u2019 and the right kinda food.\u201d\n\nRed Cowan picked up his rope and went out, leaving the sheriff staring\nat the rafters, trying to force his mind to function properly. He didn\u2019t\nwant Red Cowan to leave him. He had never failed to bring in his man,\nand if Red Cowan ever left that ranch----\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis hand reached up weakly and drew the heavy Colt from the holster. It\nwas fully loaded. The weight of it quickly tired his wrist, and he\nstared at his bloodless hand. The fever had sapped his strength badly,\nand he lay back wearily, cursing himself for a quitter.\n\nHe was no match for Red Cowan now. Hadn\u2019t Cowan said something about\ntying him down? The sheriff tried to sit up. If Red Cowan tied him\ndown----\n\n\u201cGet up, you fool!\u201d he told himself. \u201cYo\u2019re all right. Are you goin\u2019 to\nlie here and let a murderer escape? You are Duty Deming, sheriff of\nCalor!\u201d\n\nWith a superhuman effort he managed to swing around on the bunk and get\nhis feet over the edge; but toppled back, where he lay breathing\nheavily, gripping the gun in his right hand.\n\nHe could feel the fever coming back, but he would not let that stop him.\nIt was now or never. No thought of the future--only the present. The law\nmust be served.\n\nHe managed to reach the doorway, where he went to his knees, blinking\nout at the sunlight. It dazzled his eyes, until the tears ran down his\ncheeks, and he dropped his head to one knee, covering his eyes with his\narm.\n\n\u201cNo other gods before Me,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWhat did she mean? What would\nrise up and kill me?\u201d\n\nHis fumbling fingers tried to locate his star, not realizing that he\nwore nothing but his underclothes. He laughed foolishly in the crook of\nhis elbow. His mind was clouding again.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t die,\u201d he told himself. \u201cIt\u2019s my duty to live. I\u2019ve got to\nlive!\u201d\n\nHe got slowly to his feet, fighting hard. \u201cThey\u2019ll hang him--hang Red\nCowan. Eye for an eye. The law demands that. I\u2019m the law of Calor, ain\u2019t\nI? Don\u2019t the law demand his life?\u201d\n\nThe sheriff sagged wearily, gripping the side of the door with his left\nhand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the law,\u201d he muttered drunkenly. \u201cI demand----\u201d\n\nThe fever cloud was enveloping him again, and the little blue devils\nwith their sledges were beating on his brain, trying to batter him into\ninsensibility.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhere was Red Cowan, he wondered? Where had he gone? He was obliged to\nuse both hands to cock the Colt. Red Cowan. That was what he wanted. The\nman with the flame-colored hair. There was no gratitude for what Red had\ndone for him. No thought of the days and nights of nursing. The law must\nbe satisfied, and Duty Deming was the law.\n\nHe went stumbling across the uneven ground, sagging at the knees, his\nhead swinging from side to side, almost trailing the cocked revolver in\nhis right hand; fighting, fighting all the while.\n\nThen he saw his quarry just at the corner of the old stable. It was Red\nCowan, looking at him. The big Colt swung up and his finger tightened on\nthe trigger. The recoil jerked the gun from his hands and he almost\nfell.\n\nHe did not look for the gun. One shot had been enough. He hunched one\nshoulder against the old stable wall, gasping for breath. The law had\nbeen satisfied. He closed his eyes for a moment. The devils were still\nhammering on his brain, but above it all he could hear another sound; a\nthump, thump, thump of horses walking.\n\nSlowly he opened his eyes and tried to see what the blurred thing was.\nHe knew it was a man on a horse, although his eyes did not register the\nfigures.\n\n\u201cJim Deming!\u201d said a voice. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Jim!\u201d\n\nIt was Joe Mills, the ex-deputy.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t yuh know me, Jim?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cThis is Joe Mills.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d whispered Deming. \u201cYuh quit me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAw, forget that. We\u2019ve been huntin\u2019 all over the country for you, Jim;\nand I----\u201d\n\n\u201cI had to do my duty,\u201d whispered Deming. He lifted his right hand with a\nsupreme effort and pointed a finger waveringly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Red Cowan,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYo\u2019re crazy!\u201d blurted the deputy. \u201cThat ain\u2019t Red Cowan.\u201d\n\nFor several moments the sheriff did not move. His face twisted\nstrangely. \u201cYou say that ain\u2019t Red Cowan?\u201d he whispered hoarsely.\n\n\u201cOf course not, you danged fool.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, Joe! My God, don\u2019t lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t lyin\u2019, Jim. Yo\u2019re crazy, I tell yuh. Of course this ain\u2019t Red\nCowan. I know Red.\u201d\n\nFor a moment the sheriff\u2019s head sagged heavily, but he swung himself\naway from the stable, started toward the house on uncertain legs, but\ncollapsed, falling flat on his face.\n\n\u201cNow, wouldn\u2019t that rasp yuh!\u201d snorted the deputy, as he swung off his\nhorse and walked over to the prostrate sheriff. He picked him up and\ntook him to the shade, where he laid him on the ground.\n\nSomething about the sheriff caused the deputy to make a quick\nexamination.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be totally darned!\u201d he said slowly.\n\nThen he turned his head and saw Red Cowan, riding in from beyond the\nstable; riding a bareback horse and leading another.\n\n\u201cHello, Mills!\u201d yelled Cowan. \u201cWhere\u2019d you come from?\u201d\n\n\u201cC\u2019mere,\u201d said the ex-deputy, and Cowan rode up to him.\n\n\u201cBy golly, I thought I should have tied him down,\u201d said Cowan.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d said Mills slowly.\n\n\u201cDead? Whatcha know about that? I found him several nights ago, plumb\nflat over there in the lava beds. He was too sick to talk; so I brought\nhim here. I\u2019ve had one hell of a time, nursin\u2019 him, Joe. Got smallpox, I\nreckon.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeasles,\u201d said Joe. \u201cMust \u2019a\u2019 got \u2019em from a hobo he had in jail at\nCalor. Hobo almost died, too. Didn\u2019t Deming tell yuh what he was doin\u2019\nin the lava beds?\u201d\n\n\u201cToo sick, I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was lookin\u2019 for you, Red. Wanted yuh for the murder of Mitchell.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cFact. Delong brought the news of it, and Deming started on yore trail.\nBut Delong got throwed against a hitchrack post that mornin\u2019, and it\nhurt him so bad he died that same afternoon. But before he died he\nconfessed to murderin\u2019 old Mitchell himself. He just thought he\u2019d put\nthe deadwood on you, \u2019cause you quarreled with Mitchell before yuh\nquit.\u201d\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nRed Cowan laughed shortly. \u201cSo that was it, eh? Deming didn\u2019t mention it\nto me. Mebbe he was too sick.\u201d\n\n\u201cProb\u2019ly. Too bad he didn\u2019t live longer, Red. Delong confessed that\nMitchell hired him to plant evidence that sent Harry Deming to the pen.\nWe\u2019ll have Harry out in a few days.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be danged!\u201d\n\n\u201cQueer, ain\u2019t it?\u201d mused Joe, looking down at the body of the sheriff.\n\u201cHis wife said that some day his star would rise up and kill him. She\nsaid he was makin\u2019 a god out of his star. I dunno, Red. Things have a\nqueer way of workin\u2019 out. If he hadn\u2019t been so strong on duty he\u2019d never\nhave taken that sick hobo off that train. Deming always had the idea of\nbein\u2019 his brother\u2019s keeper, yuh know.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard. Duty they called him, didn\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. Awful set in his ways. I suppose we might as well start back with\nhim.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure; might as well. Sorry I didn\u2019t rope him down. But he seemed to be\nall right when I left. Fever made his heart weak, I suppose. But he\nnever told me he was after me, Joe.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t. I can figure out where he got the measles and I can figure\nout why he didn\u2019t tell yuh what he was doin\u2019 in the lava beds, but I\u2019ll\nbe damned if I can figure out why he killed the red bull calf and said\nit was you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know about that, Joe. He must have been crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cMm-m-m-m,\u201d said Joe slowly. \u201cI s\u2019pose he was. Red, do yuh believe in\nthem Ten Commandments?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever read any of \u2019em. What are they about?\u201d\n\n\u201cEverythin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cMust be good, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cWorth readin\u2019. Git a rope and we\u2019ll take him home.\u201d",
