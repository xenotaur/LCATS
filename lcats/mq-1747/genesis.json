    "body": "The unreal silence of outer space closed in about _The Traveler_. In\nfront of the huge atom-powered space rocket hung the sun's dazzling\ndisc and behind the pale, silver face of the earth echoed the light.\nCaptain Vic Arlen was a god in the heavens; Dave McFerson, the\nengineer, was a demi-god. And what was Harry Renzu? It was hard to\ncall a great scientist a devil.\n\nThere was Gheal--neither god nor devil, only a poor, hideous,\nhalf-human slave that had been brought with Renzu to the earth from a\nprevious expedition to Venus. Captain Arlen quit trying to classify\nhimself and his passengers. They were neither gods nor devils. Not even\nmen, taking the group as a whole.\n\nAn ominous chill seemed to reach through the beryllium hull of the ship\nfrom outer space, caressing Arlen's backbone. A faint cry sounded in\nthe passageway that led to the sleeping quarters behind the control\nroom.\n\nThe captain tripped the controls into neutral. The acceleration was\ncomplete and from now until the braking rockets were fired, the craft\nwould follow its carefully calculated orbit.\n\nAgain came the cry, a groan of pain and a moaning sob. The captain\nstrode into the passage.\n\n\"Gheal!\" he called, recognizing the Venusian's hoarse voice. \"Gheal!\nWhat's the matter?\"\n\nA repetition of the cry was the only answer. The passageway was open,\nbut the sobs seemed to be coming from the cabin of Harry Renzu, the\nscientist who had chartered the moon rocket for his second expedition\nto Venus.\n\nThe captain paused before the cabin door, listening. The cry came again\nand he pushed open the door.\n\nThe hideous Venusian was on the floor, looking upward with his two\nlight-sensitive eye-glands at Renzu, who stood over him with an\nupraised cane.\n\nGheal's rubbery, lipless mouth was agape, revealing his long, sharp\nteeth. He had raised one of his long, rope-muscled arms to catch the\ndescending blow. His hairless, leathery body trembled slightly with\npain.\n\n\"You dumb, dim-witted chunk of Venusian protoplasm!\" Renzu snarled as\nhe brought the cane crashing over the monster's shoulders. \"When I want\na thing done, I want it done!\"\n\nArlen pushed into the room and seized Renzu's arm before the scientist\ncould strike again.\n\n\"Hold on, Renzu!\" Arlen commanded, pushing the scientist back and\nseizing the cane. \"Lay off! Can't you treat this miserable wretch with\ndecency?\"\n\nRenzu's face flushed angrily. His deep-set eyes burned with fury.\n\n\"This is none of your affair!\" Renzu snapped. \"Go back to your business\nof running this ship. I didn't hire you to run my business.\"\n\n\"This may be your expedition,\" Arlen replied stubbornly, \"but while\nwe're in space, I'm the captain of this ship and my orders are to be\nobeyed. My orders are to give this Venusian beast humane treatment.\"\n\nA whimpering sob broke from the throat of the brute on the floor.\n\nRenzu sullenly twisted his arm loose from the captain's grasp. He\nappeared more calm now.\n\n\"You are right, Arlen,\" he said. \"Your orders are to be obeyed. But you\naren't a scientist. You don't know Gheal. He's not like the animals we\nknow on the earth. He has to be beaten.\"\n\n\"Not while we're in space. I won't stand for it.\"\n\n\"You can't stand in the way of science, Arlen. I shall whip Gheal, if I\ndeem it necessary.\" Renzu ended his words with a suggestive snap of his\nfingers in Gheal's direction. The monster cringed into a corner of the\nstateroom.\n\n\"Come with me, Gheal,\" Arlen ordered, beckoning to the monster.\n\nThe creature, seeming to understand, rose to his feet and followed\nArlen out of the door.\n\n<tb>\n\nThe captain took the Venusian forward into the control room, where he\ndaubed the welts on the creature's naked shoulders with arnica.\n\nMcFerson, easy-going, but dependable old spaceman, watched the\noperation critically. Gheal winced as the arnica touched his skin. He\nsquirmed and tried to resist.\n\n\"Hold on a minute, Cap,\" McFerson said. \"Look at the right shoulder,\nwhere you put the arnica; it's red and inflamed.\"\n\n\"So it is, but arnica ought to help.\"\n\n\"Look at the left shoulder, where you haven't put any arnica.\"\n\n\"Great guns! It's almost healed!\"\n\n\"I'd say maybe arnica wasn't the best treatment.\"\n\nCaptain Arlen corked the bottle and put it aside. \"Gheal looks like a\nman. Sometimes he acts like a man. Yet he's entirely different most of\nthe time.\n\n\"I've been watching him, Cap. I somehow get the idea that Gheal finds\nit unhandy, most of the time, to be built like a man.\"\n\nThe captain laughed. He took Gheal's arm and held it up. \"Look at that.\nGood, human bones, but the body of a monster. I wish you could talk,\nGheal. I wish you could tell us more about yourself. Why are you almost\na man yet the farthest point south?\"\n\nGheal uttered a sort of deep-throated growl.\n\n\"Renzu says you can be vicious--that you're a killer at heart. Renzu\nsaid one of your kind killed Jimmy Brooks on the first expedition. You\ndon't look like a killer. Brooks was a big man. You'd have a hard time\nkilling him.\"\n\nGheal's sight-glands stared from Arlen to McFerson.\n\nArlen laughed and patted Gheal's hairless head and pointed to a\nbuilt-in seat in the corner.\n\n\"You're welcome to stay here as long as you don't bother us,\" he said.\n\nGheal shuffled uneasily and whimpered, but he did not go to the\nseat. Instead, he turned and moved toward the door. The creature\nlooked ridiculous, clad as he was only in a pair of Renzu's discarded\ntrousers, which had been rolled at the bottom to fit his stubby legs.\n\nAt the door the Venusian hesitated and glanced back at the captain.\nThen he slowly turned and shuffled down the passageway.\n\n\"Hey you!\" Captain Arlen shouted. \"Come back here!\"\n\nGheal did not stop. He was striding to Renzu's room. He pushed open the\ndoor.\n\nA fear for Renzu's safety rushed into the captain's mind. He ran after\nthe creature and entered Renzu's cabin. But as he opened the door he\ngasped in astonishment.\n\nGheal was crawling into a corner of the room, while Renzu stood nearby\nlaughing.\n\n\"You see, Arlen,\" smiled Renzu, \"I'm his master. He recognizes my\nauthority and no one else's. He would not desert me, no matter how I\ntreated him.\"\n\nRenzu picked up the cane that Arlen had tossed on the bunk a few\nminutes before. As the scientist shook the stick at Gheal, Arlen\nthought he saw a look of satisfaction creep into the creature's face.\n\n\"Just the same,\" Arlen said, \"I can't stand your beating him. He may\nenjoy it. He may be a masochist at heart, but I won't stand for it.\"\n\n\"Your mind is provincially human, Arlen,\" said Renzu. \"When you look\nat Gheal you see the product of an entirely different evolution. You\nsee a creature without emotions, without ethics. He's devoid of every\nterrestrial feeling, especially gratitude. He may even hate you for\ntaking his side against me.\"\n\nThere was a trace of bitterness in Renzu's voice.\n\n\"I wouldn't be too sure, Renzu,\" Arlen said. \"If the laws of physics\napply on Venus, as well as the earth, why couldn't biological and\npsychological laws apply there also. Even the lowest of creatures show\nunderstandable reactions on earth. Why not on Venus?\"\n\n\"Because Gheal has been made differently,\" Renzu said, with a repulsive\ngrin.\n\n<tb>\n\nHour by hour Captain Arlen watched Venus grow in size. The planet\nexpanded from a glowing crescent to the size of the moon as seen from\nthe earth; soon it floated large in space, filling half the sky ahead\nof the ship, a billowing, fluffy ball of shining clouds. Its surface\nwas entirely obscured by its misty atmosphere.\n\nArlen began braking the ship and he called Renzu into the control room\nfor a conference on where to pierce the cloud blanket.\n\nRenzu, huge and muscular, overdid himself in graciousness as he greeted\nArlen in the control room. The scientist seemed to radiate exaltation\nand he strained himself to appear congenial.\n\nThe man was excited, Arlen decided, for Arlen himself was thrilled\nat the prospect of adventure, of seeing strange sights on a strange\nplanet. But the reaction was different in Arlen. Where Renzu swelled\nand swaggered, Arlen looked dreamily into the clouds ahead.\n\n\"I'm bringing the ship around to the sunward side,\" Arlen said. \"It's\nbest to land about noon--that is the noon point. The planet turns once\nin thirty hours and that will give us a little more than seven hours of\ndaylight to orient ourselves after the landing.\"\n\nRenzu nodded in agreement. All this had been threshed out before.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said, \"but it is best that you pierce the clouds at\nabout forty-five degrees north latitude. There's ocean there that\nnearly circles the planet and there's fewer chances of running into\nmountains beneath the clouds. Once we're through the cloud belt, we'll\nhave no difficulty. The clouds are three or four miles above the\nsurface and there's plenty of room to maneuver beneath them.\"\n\nArlen twisted the valves and the deceleration became uncomfortably\nviolent. Renzu's first trip had determined the existence of a\nbreathable atmosphere on the surface of Venus, although the cloud belt\nwas filled with gases given off by Venusian volcanoes, and many of\nthese gases were poisonous to man.\n\nIn a few minutes the rocket ship stood off just above the cloud belt.\nMcFerson checked the landing mechanism and made his final report to the\ncaptain. Arlen checked the gravity gauge, which now would be used as an\naltimeter during the blind flying in the Venusian clouds.\n\n\"Okay!\" Captain Arlen called.\n\n\"Okay!\" echoed McFerson.\n\n_The Traveler_ nosed downward into the rolling clouds. A whistling\nwhine arose as the craft struck the atoms of the atmosphere. Repulsion\njets set up their thunder and the landing operation began.\n\nThe ship settled slowly through the clouds. The mist completely\nobscured everything outside the craft and Arlen flew blind, trusting\nhis meteor detection devices to warn him of mountain peaks, which he\nfeared despite Renzu's assurance that there were no high ranges at this\nlatitude.\n\nAt last the craft dropped through the wispy canopy to float serenely\nover a calm ocean which bulged upward toward them in the solar flood\ntide.\n\nTo the northwest was a dim coastline. High mountains were faintly\nvisible against the horizon.\n\n\"Perfect!\" said Renzu. \"That is my continent--our destination. Sail\ntoward it.\"\n\nThe ship zoomed toward the land at the comparatively slow speed of five\nhundred miles an hour. In a few minutes it was decelerating again, with\nthe continent before them.\n\nThe high mountain range clambered up from a narrow plain that skirted\nthe sea. This plain was sandy, a desert waste, but Renzu indicated it\nwas the spot for the landing.\n\nArlen brought _The Traveler_ down gently alongside a broad stream that\nemptied into the sea. When the dust of the landing cleared away, he\nlooked with dumbfounded amazement at the Venusian scene.\n\nAs far as his eyes could see were barren rocks and sand: there were\nno trees, no grass, no signs of life. The planet was as sterile as an\nantiseptic solution. Even seaweed and mosses were missing from the\nseashore.\n\n\"Maybe you know what you're doing, Renzu,\" Arlen said, \"but it looks to\nme as if you've directed us to the edge of a desert.\"\n\n\"'Tain't no small desert, either,\" chimed McFerson.\n\n\"My dear Arlen,\" Renzu replied, cracking his lips in another of his\nirritating smiles, \"this is one of the most fertile spots on the entire\nplanet. You must remember, Venus is much different from the earth.\"\n\n<tb>\n\nImmediately after the landing all hands, including Renzu, were busy\nwith the routine duties that the expedition required. Gheal was given\nsimple tasks, such as unpacking boxes of equipment to be used by the\nexpedition, but the Venusian seemed to attend to these in a preoccupied\nmanner. He worked in sort of a daze, frequently whimpering like a\nsick dog, and turning his globular eyes from time to time out of the\nporthole at the landscape of his native planet.\n\n\"He's homesick,\" McFerson suggested to Arlen. \"But look! What's he got\nin his hand?\"\n\nIt was a long white bar of metal. Arlen quickly seized the bar and\nexamined it. It was pure silver. Gheal had been unpacking a box\ncrammed with silver bars of assorted lengths and thicknesses, ranging\nfrom the size of small wire up to rods half an inch thick and a foot or\nmore in length. A fortune in silver had been transported to Venus.\n\n\"Well, that's Renzu's business, not mine,\" Arlen decided.\n\nHe returned to his duties. There was much to do: the engines had to be\nrecharged, preparatory to a quick takeoff, should conditions arise to\nmake the planet untenable for earthmen.\n\nTests of the soil revealed utter sterility of all forms of life. It\nwas baffling. Some sort of bacteria should have been in the soil, even\nthough the place was only a desert.\n\nArlen opened the arms chest and issued small but powerful atomic\ndisintegrators to McFerson, Renzu and himself. He did not give Gheal\none of the weapons, for Gheal did not appear to have the skill\nnecessary to operate it. His uncanny ignorance was so obvious.\n\nThe disintegrators were simple magnetic mechanisms capable of\ncollapsing atoms of atmosphere and sending the resultant force of\nenergy in a directed stream toward a target. Fire from disintegrators\ncould melt large rocks almost instantly and it could destroy any living\ncreature known to man.\n\nRenzu strapped his weapon at his side and turned to Arlen.\n\n\"I'm going outside for a walk with Gheal,\" he said. \"Gheal seems\nnervous and uneasy. Perhaps his actions are due to his return to his\nnative land. A walk might make him happier, in his own peculiar way.\"\n\nArlen nodded and went back to the control room to talk to McFerson. He\nfound the engineer looking out of a porthole.\n\n\"Look!\" McFerson said, pointing out the porthole.\n\nTrudging along the beach, carrying the case containing the silver rods,\nwere Renzu and Gheal. The Venusian was walking with difficulty, but as\nhe faltered, Renzu would kick him unmercifully and force him on.\n\n\"The devil!\" Captain Arlen said. \"He doesn't dare beat Gheal when he\nknows I'm watching.\"\n\nMcFerson shook his head.\n\n\"Maybe he's right, treating Gheal that way,\" he said. \"After all,\nRenzu is a scientist and he knows more about Gheal than we do. Maybe\nhe's right in saying beating is the only treatment Gheal understands.\nBesides, I don't know if I trust Gheal. Since we've landed he's acted\nlike a tiger in a cage. Gheal's a Venusian and Venusians are supposed\nto have murdered Renzu's partner on the first expedition.\"\n\n\"But even the worst creature on earth--except man, perhaps--doesn't\nkill without a reason. And even man sometimes has a reason, when\napparently he hasn't.\"\n\nDarkness descended rapidly on Venus and Renzu did not return. The two\nspacemen decided it was unnecessary to stand guard and turned in. Renzu\nknew how to operate the space locks from the outside of the ship and\ncould enter when he returned. Gheal, whose clumsy fingers were too\nunwieldly even to operate a disintegrator gun, would not be able to\noperate the locks, nor would any creature like him.\n\nIt was still dark when Arlen awakened. The long, fifteen-hour Venusian\nnight was completed and still Renzu had not returned.\n\nThe captain awakened McFerson. They ate a light breakfast and did minor\nchores on the ship until daylight suddenly lighted the landscape.\n\n\"Do you suppose we ought to look for them? Maybe Gheal went haywire.\nMaybe something's happened.\"\n\nArlen considered. Renzu was armed, while Gheal was not. Renzu claimed\ncomplete mastery over the Venusian, yet something might have happened\nto give Gheal the upper hand. Not that Renzu didn't deserve it.\n\n\"I'll go outside and look around,\" Arlen said.\n\nArlen stepped through the locks. The warm Venusian air was\ninvigorating. He took a deep breath.\n\nA shuffling sound behind him caused the captain to turn. There,\nrounding the end of the ship was a creature, fully naked, staring at\nhim with gland-like eyes and baring his teeth in a vicious snarl.\n\n\"Gheal!\" Arlen cried. \"Gheal! Where's Renzu?\"\n\nThe creature did not reply. Instead, it advanced slowly with a\nshuffling crouch, stretching his arms menacingly toward Arlen.\n\n<tb>\n\nArlen's hand went to his disintegrator. The creature resembled Gheal,\nbut it did not act like Gheal. The captain's eyes swept over the animal\nagain. No, it wasn't Gheal. There were differences. It was another of\nGheal's race.\n\nArlen hesitated to kill the creature. If there were a tribe of the\ncreatures in the vicinity, such an act would arouse enmity. It would\nlead to complications that would endanger Renzu, who was away from\nthe ship. Yet, Arlen could not be sure what reaction would follow a\nslaying. Renzu had said that Venusians had no emotions, in the sense\nthat man has them. But Gheal certainly had been nostalgic on the day\nbefore. That at least was understandable in a human sense.\n\nArlen leveled his pistol. Suddenly another figure appeared.\n\nA low-voiced whine sounded as the second figure darted forward.\n\nIt was the real Gheal. He was still wearing Renzu's trousers.\n\nThe first Venusian turned. He hesitated stupidly, undecided whether\nto continue his charge toward Arlen, or to meet the foe who came from\nbehind. Finally, the beast apparently decided that Arlen was the most\ntempting.\n\nThe animal sprang at the captain.\n\nArlen held his gun ready to fire, but the Venusian had acted with a\nswiftness that belied his clumsy appearance. Before Arlen could fire, a\nheavy, rubbery arm crashed down on his skull. A meteor shower seemed to\nflash through Arlen's brain, and then darkness closed in about him as\nhe tumbled to the sandy beach.\n\nArlen opened his eyes. He had no way of telling how long he had lain\non the ground. On Venus one never sees the sun; daylight appears and\ndaylight fades, but there is no way of telling the time of day from the\nposition of the sun overhead.\n\nThe captain's head ached as he lifted himself from the ground. He shook\nhis head to clear away the haze and he stretched his arms to rise. His\nfingers struck something leathery and cold.\n\nThere at his side lay the Venusian monster who had attacked him. A wave\nof nausea swept over him as he saw the lifeless body horribly mutilated\nand torn. The sandy soil of the beach was torn with the struggle that\nhad taken place.\n\nArlen forgot his aching head at he examined the dead Venusian. His\ndisintegrator had not slain the Venusian; clearly Gheal had done the\njob.\n\n\"So Gheal came to my rescue!\" Arlen exclaimed. \"Renzu must have been\nwrong. These Venusians do have gratitude.\"\n\nHis eyes saw something else as they traveled over the body.\n\nProtruding from the body was a silver rod. Gingerly Arlen tried to pull\nthe rod from the animal's body, but it would not budge. Was it a weapon?\n\nArlen saw other rods sticking from the animal, covered with blood. All\nof them seemed firmly set in the body of the Venusian.\n\nArlen looked behind him. The locks of the space ship were open. He\nmoved wearily to the door and stuck his head inside.\n\n\"McFerson!\" he called.\n\nThere was no answer.\n\nArlen entered the ship. He carried his disintegrator in his hand.\nVenusians might have entered the ship ahead of him. Lights were still\nburning in the living quarters, but McFerson was gone.\n\nArlen moved on; he searched each cabin, but there was no sign of\nMcFerson, until he reached the control room. There furniture had been\noverturned, instruments smashed, and a pool of blood lay on the floor.\n\nGheal had done this. Arlen was sure that no other Venusian could have\nentered the ship and crept up on McFerson without arousing suspicion.\nMcFerson's disintegrator lay on the floor beside the pool of blood,\nindicating that McFerson had grown suspicious too late. The gun had not\nbeen discharged.\n\nThe first thing Arlen had to do was to protect himself from further\nattack. He drew his own gun and closed the outer locks. The next thing\nwould be to decide what had happened and what to do.\n\nRenzu probably had suffered the same fate as McFerson, Arlen decided.\nHe was alone, in a strange world, face to face with a race of\nmankilling monsters. The only thing in his favor was that one of these\nmonsters had befriended him. But how long and how far could Arlen trust\nthis friendship?\n\nThere was, however, a chance that McFerson or Renzu still might be\nliving. He had to know for sure about this before he did anything else.\nAnd the only way to learn was to investigate.\n\nHe left the ship, carefully closing the locks and fastening them behind\nhim. He found many tracks leading away from the ship, along the banks\nof the stream that flowed from the mountains.\n\nFrom among the tracks he picked out Renzu's bootprints. There were\ntracks of Gheal going away, coming back, and going away again. He\ndistinguished the two sets of Gheal's prints leading toward the\nmountains by the fact that one set was more deeply imprinted in the\nmoist sand than the other. Gheal had been carrying McFerson's body.\n\nBut what was this? There was another set of tracks coming toward the\nspace ship. They were not Gheal's prints, for they were three toed.\nGheal had five toes. Gheal and the creature who had attacked Arlen were\ndifferent--one had three, the other five toes.\n\nGheal might not have rescued Arlen out of gratitude after all. A\nnatural enmity might have existed between the two races of Venusians.\nArlen's rescue might have been an accident.\n\nArlen studied. There was something else that fitted into the picture.\nIf he could fit it correctly, he would have the answer. Somehow, now,\nhe doubted if Gheal had rescued him out of gratitude; yet, he doubted\nif the rescue had been purely accidental.\n\nArlen returned to the space ship and loaded a haversack with food. He\nwas going into the mountains to get to the bottom of the mystery. He\nscribbled a note and left it in the control cabin in case Renzu or\nMcFerson returned; if either were alive.\n\n<tb>\n\nThe captain followed the stream into a deep-walled canyon opening\ninto the mountains. A short distance from the ship he found Gheal's\ndiscarded trousers, indicating beyond a doubt that the Venusian had\ncome this way after Arlen had been knocked unconscious in the sand.\n\nA mile or so farther on he saw a print where Gheal had placed McFerson\non the ground. Then, a thrill of gratitude swept over Arlen, another\nset of boot prints appeared on the trail. McFerson was not dead. He\nwas walking.\n\nThe daylight was fading and Arlen realized he would not have much more\ntime to follow the tracks without the aid of his flashlight. The walls\nof the gorge were almost perpendicular now and nearly a mile high on\neach side of the stream. The river boiled and churned over the barren\nrocks, but its movement was the only animation of the scene. Nowhere\nwere there signs of life, excepting the footprints on the trail.\n\nAt last the trail forked upward from the stream, following a narrow\nledge of rock along the canyon wall. The footprints of the slain\nVenusian now were wide apart and deeply imprinted in the sand,\nindicating that the creature had run rapidly down the path.\n\n\"He probably spotted our ship landing and headed toward us right away,\"\nmuttered Arlen. \"His presence outside the craft may have been what made\nGheal so uneasy yesterday. Gheal sensed an enemy near at hand.\" But\nthis didn't seem to be the answer, either.\n\nBeyond the next curve the canyon walls slid back and the ledge widened\ninto a gentle slope leading to the top of the canyon. As Arlen climbed\nover the rim he found himself on a plateau.\n\nIt was dark now, but the place was lighted by a huge campfire not far\naway. Huddled around the campfire were four figures. In the still air\nof the night, Arlen heard guttural grunts of Venusians and above these\ntones he heard the sharp voice of Harry Renzu issuing commands to these\nalien beasts.\n\nArlen crept forward and concealed himself behind a rock. There were\nthree Venusians. He saw something else, too. McFerson, his head swathed\nin bandages, was sitting in the shadow of a huge square stone.\n\nArlen watched. He could not hear Renzu's words and he moved forward to\nobtain a better view, when his hand sank into a sticky mass of slime.\n\n\"Ugh!\" he grunted in disgust, lifting his hand.\n\nIt was covered with a thick, viscous jelly. It was sticky and as he\nturned his flashlight on the stuff he saw that it was colorless and\ntranslucent. It was not a plant or an animal. It did not move, it was\ncold, and had no structure, nor roots.\n\nShielding his light so that it could not be seen from the campfire,\nArlen examined the ground around him. There were other small pools of\nthe stuff in the hollows of rocks and in thick masses on the ground.\n\nThe captain examined the material more closely. It looked strangely\nfamiliar, and some of the text-book science he had learned in\ncollege came back to him. He remembered examining stuff like this\nonce under a microscope. It was not petroleum, but something vastly\ndifferent--something that was synonymous with life.\n\nIt was protoplasm!\n\n<tb>\n\nVic Arlen gasped.\n\n\"Protoplasm! Inanimate protoplasm!\"\n\nHe forgot he had been nauseated by the slime a moment before and began\nto examine the stuff closely. Of course, it was protoplasm, it couldn't\nbe anything else. Vic Arlen had studied it. He knew. Nothing could hold\nwater granules in suspension in exactly the same way; nothing had the\nsame baffling construction.\n\nBut there was a question: scientists admitted life could not exist\nwithout protoplasm, but could protoplasm exist without life?\n\nIn living protoplasm, death alters the structure. But other processes\nthan life could, conceivably, preserve the stability of the substance.\nThis would explain the existence of inanimate protoplasm on Venus.\n\nAnd why didn't inanimate protoplasm exist on the earth? Arlen thought\nfor a moment and had the answer for that too. Animal life lives on\nprotoplasm, as well as being protoplasm itself. Animate protoplasm\ncan reproduce its kind, but the inanimate kind can neither fight back\nnor replace its losses. The inanimate protoplasm on the earth had\ndisappeared with the appearance of the first animal life. The coming of\nthe first microbes had caused it to \"decay.\"\n\nIf protoplasm existed on the face of Venus it meant there were no\nbacteria, no germs of any sort--_no life!_\n\nHow could Arlen explain Gheal without evolution from the simple to the\ncomplex? Was evolution working differently on Venus? Again Arlen had\nrun up a blind alley.\n\nThe campfire cast a flickering red glow against the clouds. In spots\nabove the skies were tinted with other glows from the craters of\nVenusian volcanoes. It was not absolutely dark, but it was far from\nbeing as light as a moonlit night on the earth.\n\nArlen crept closer to the scene. He could see the Venusians plainly\nnow. Two of them had three toes, while one had five. The five-toed one\nwas Gheal.\n\nRenzu stood before them, grasping his cane. He would make sharp\ncommands and the Venusians would rise. If they disobeyed, he would\nstrike them with the cane. They would shriek with pain. At last these\nmaneuvers ceased and Renzu turned to McFerson.\n\n\"They have to be taught everything,\" he said. \"They have no reflex\nactions, no emotions, no instinct--nothing that the lowest creatures on\nearth may have. Yet they have everything that makes those things in the\ncreatures of the earth.\"\n\nMcFerson did not reply. He was watching with staring eyes; eyes filled\nwith horror.\n\nRenzu reached behind a rock. He drew what appeared to be a human\nskeleton from the shadow. As Arlen looked a second time, he saw that\nit was not a human skeleton, but an imitation built of the silver rods\nand wires that Renzu had transported to Venus. The truth was dawning on\nArlen, but it was unnecessary now, for Renzu was explaining.\n\n\"I have created life, McFerson. I have moulded a human likeness out of\nprotoplasm and fitted it over bones of silver. An electrical device I\nhave made starts the biological processes going and the protoplasm,\nworking with chemical exactitude, reforms itself into glands, organs,\nmuscles and nerves. The product is a beast, inferior to man but\nsuperior to the highest animal on earth, except that he is totally\ndevoid of such things as reflexes, instincts, emotions and other\nsurvival psychological processes.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Renzu was moulding some of the protoplasm over the\nframework of bones. Arlen understood now why the silver rods had\nprotruded from the Venusian he had found on the beach. Those pieces of\nsilver had been the creature's bones.\n\n\"I made four of the creatures on my previous expedition. Brooks helped\nme construct three of them, including the creature that attacked\nand killed Arlen on the beach. I made Gheal myself. Gheal was a\nmasterpiece. He was almost, but not quite human. That is why I took him\nto earth with me.\"\n\n\"You're inhuman, Renzu!\" McFerson managed to say. \"You're less human\nthan Gheal!\"\n\n\"Gheal was more human than you think, McFerson. Brooks, you know, was\nkilled by one of his creations. The same monster that killed Arlen\naccounted for him. Yet that monster, in some ways, was above average.\nAt least he had the beginnings of an instinct. He wanted to kill. After\nBrooks was killed, I used his bones for Gheal's skeleton.\"\n\nArlen stared in speechless horror and amazement.\n\n\"And that isn't all. I'm going to use Arlen's bones for a creature\nmore human than Gheal. Perhaps, McFerson, your bones may be used for\nsomething greater still. I will make other men, and women, from silver\nwire and protoplasm, and create a race of Venusians that will bring\nlife to this planet. Think of a planet that has evolution beginning\nwith man and ending with something greater than man has ever dreamed.\nAnd I, McFerson, will be the god of this race!\"\n\nMcFerson tried to rise, but Gheal rose with a low throated growl, and\nthe spaceman sank back on the ground.\n\n<tb>\n\nRenzu had finished moulding the protoplasm over the silver bones. With\nthe help of one of the Venusians he lifted the still form into the air\nand placed it carefully inside the stone behind McFerson.\n\nThe stone had been hollowed to form a rock sarcophagus.\n\nArlen saw in the firelight that electric wires ran from a small battery\nbeside the box.\n\nRenzu touched the switch.\n\nThere was a flash of blinding light and sparks flew over the box. Then\nRenzu turned off the current and opened the sarcophagus. He worked\nrapidly with his hands and then stepped back, holding his cane before\nhim.\n\nFrom the box emerged another Venusian. A replica of Gheal's three-toed\ncompanions.\n\nFor a moment the creature stood motionless, staring from the sight\nglands at his surroundings. Renzu struck the monster sharply with his\ncane. The brute moved. Again Renzu struck and the creature moved. At\nlast it seemed to understand, after Renzu struck it repeatedly. The\nbeast got out of the box.\n\nRenzu belabored his creation unmercifully with the cane, each movement\nhad to be directed.\n\n\"They have to be taught everything,\" Renzu said. \"They understand\nnothing but pain. I have to beat instincts and reflexes into their dumb\nbrains, for they have no inherited ones.\"\n\nThat also explained why Renzu was a complete master over Gheal. The\nVenusian depended on Renzu for everything.\n\nSo interested was Arlen watching Renzu train the newly made Venusian,\nthat the captain did not hear the scrape of a leathery hide on the\nrocks behind him. He was unaware of the danger until a ropy cord of\nsome vile, repulsive tentacle seized him, pulled him off his feet to\nthe ground and dragged him toward the camp fire.\n\nThe rays of the firelight revealed Arlen's captor: a serpent as large\nas a python which held him in the crushing folds of its body as it\nmoved deliberately toward Renzu.\n\nRenzu was amazed at the sight of Arlen.\n\n\"I thought you were dead!\" he gasped.\n\n\"No,\" Arlen said. \"Your creation didn't quite succeed in killing me.\"\n\nRenzu smiled. \"But I see that you did bring your fine bones to me after\nall!\" He struck the serpent sharply with his cane and the monster\nreleased his grip on Arlen. \"The animal that caught you, captain, was\none of our first experiments. It was by charging a string of protoplasm\nwith electricity, that we discovered that we could make it live. The\nresult was the pseudo-python, who makes a good watchdog, if nothing\nelse. It's entirely harmless, since it feeds entirely on inanimate\nprotoplasm. Unfortunately for Brooks, it was this creature that caught\nhim and held him while No. 3--the Venusian--killed him.\"\n\n\"It was deliberate murder,\" said Arlen.\n\n\"Perhaps terrestrial law would define it as murder,\" Renzu said. \"But\nhere on Venus there is no law. It was a scientific experiment.\"\n\n\"And you will murder McFerson and me?\"\n\n\"I need your skeletons. They will be a fine heritage for future races\nof Venusians. Think how you and McFerson will be glorified in Venusian\nmythology.\"\n\nRenzu's eyes were glowing in the firelight with madness. Arlen looked\nat the hideous Venusians, seated nearby, watching idiotically. It was\ndiabolical!\n\n\"Now comes an important decision. Shall I use you, or McFerson, first?\"\n\n<tb>\n\nMcFerson closed his eyes.\n\n\"The man's insane, Cap!\"\n\nArlen looked about him. The python was nearby, coiled neatly beside a\nrock, ready to spring if he tried to escape.\n\nOne of the Venusians rose and threw some shale on the fire. It was\ncrude petroleum shale. An idea came to Arlen. If he could put out the\nfire, he might be able to escape in the darkness.\n\nThen Arlen remembered. His disintegrator was still in his pocket.\nRenzu, interested in his experiment, had forgotten to search him,\nbelieving perhaps that Arlen had been disarmed in the attack on the\nbeach.\n\nArlen was tempted to use the weapon now, and to blast Renzu and his\nhideous tribe of monsters out of existence. But to kill a man without\ngiving him a chance was not Arlen's way of doing things. The Venusians,\ntoo, now had a right to live. Had they attacked, Arlen would not have\nhesitated to kill, but Arlen realized that the only vicious Venusian\nwas dead. Perhaps Renzu himself had taught that single Venusian how to\nkill.\n\n\"McFerson,\" spoke Arlen, \"are you all right? Did Gheal hurt you?\"\n\n\"He bloodied my nose and knocked me out,\" McFerson said. \"He didn't\nmean to harm me. Gheal really is gentle as a kitten.\"\n\n\"I think I will use your bones first, Arlen,\" said Renzu. \"You may sit\ndown beside McFerson. I may as well warn you that there is no chance of\nescape. The python guards the only way back and my Venusians enjoy the\ncreation of another of their kind. They won't let a chance to see it be\nspoiled.\"\n\nRenzu began filling some woven baskets with the inanimate protoplasm as\nArlen sat down beside his companion.\n\n\"Could you run for it, if I knocked out the campfire?\" Arlen asked.\n\n\"I can run, but how will you knock out the fire?\"\n\nVic Arlen acted quickly. His hand brought the disintegrator out of\nhis pocket and he fired straight into the center of the campfire. The\natomic blast instantly consumed the inflammable material in the fire\nand the plateau was dark.\n\n\"Run!\" Arlen cried. \"And look out for the python.\"\n\nArlen sprang forward. He heard a leathery scrape ahead of him. It was\nthe serpent. He dodged back. Suddenly from behind came a hoarse cry.\n\nArlen turned, ready to blast the Venusian that had shouted. But the\nVenusian did not attack. Instead, it darted forward, and with a flying\nleap it sprang upon the python. A roar came from the Venusian's throat.\n\nIt was Gheal. Arlen would have recognized the voice anywhere.\n\nThe faint glow from the volcanoes showed him the edge of the plateau.\n\nRenzu was screaming behind him and he heard the pad-pad of the running\nfeet of the three remaining Venusians. But Arlen was clear and McFerson\nwas running beside him.\n\nArlen took his flashlight from his pocket and used it to follow the\nnarrow ledge down the mountain into the canyon. Behind the two men,\nsounds of pursuit grew fainter.\n\n\"We're safe,\" Arlen said, slackening his pace. \"Renzu won't follow us\nas long as he knows we're armed.\"\n\n\"He's armed, too,\" McFerson said.\n\n\"He wants our bones too badly to use a disintegrator on us,\" Arlen\nlaughed.\n\nThe two men traveled on. The Venusian dawn came swiftly.\n\n\"You see, Mac,\" Arlen went on, \"we're not human beings to Renzu,\nbut part of an experiment. Science has overshadowed Renzu's sense\nof values. Perhaps he murdered Jimmy Brooks; we know he would have\nmurdered us to perfect an experiment. Renzu was creating life, and he\nwould kill to do it. He wanted to be the god of a world that started\nwith a complex organism instead of a simple microbe.\"\n\n\"The only trouble is that the life lacked instincts that it took\nterrestrial animals millions of years to acquire,\" McFerson added.\n\n\"That's what creation may be, Mac,\" said Arlen. \"We did more in a few\nminutes than Renzu did with all his scientific knowledge. Gheal learned\nthe meaning of gratitude. I treated him kindly, and he repaid me by\nhelping us escape.\"\n\nThey reached the ship. The sea was boiling over the sands. Here and\nthere, along the water's edge as the dawn broke over Venus, they\nsaw globose formations of inanimate Venusian protoplasm, seemingly\nawaiting the spark that would turn them into living organisms.\n\nVenus was in an azoic age, but life was beginning to appear. It was\nlife created by a human god, who also was a human devil, a monster.\nFuture generations of Venusians might worship Harry Renzu, unknowing\nthat it was the lowly Gheal that brought the first worthwhile instinct\nto their race.\n\nSomewhere, far behind in the canyon, were four hideous monsters and a\nbeast that resembled a serpent. This stampede of protoplasmic creation\nwas led by its mad god, driven onward by the lust of this insane\ndemiurge for the bones of his fellow deities.\n\n\"Okay!\" said Arlen, priming the rockets.\n\n\"Okay!\" shouted McFerson.\n\n_The Traveler_ was ready to rocket home.",
