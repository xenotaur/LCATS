    "body": "The first half mile into the swamp hadn't been so bad, but now Mallard\nbegan to feel really afraid. There were things in here that no spaceman\nhad ever seen and against some of them the small blaster on his hip\nwould be about as effective as a popgun.\n\nA little way ahead of him, he could dimly see the naked body of the\nMercurian swamp girl and he swore enviously at the way she slipped\nthrough the dense fern growth, her webbed feet gripping the mud firmly.\nOnce she held up her hand warningly and he slipped down behind a fallen\ntree fern to let a huge plant slug glide past. The thing was nearly\nforty feet in length and it could move with the speed of an express\ntrain.\n\nWhen it was gone, he got up and followed the swamp girl again. He\nhugged the helmet to him closer and grinned at the feel of the strange\nmetal in his hands. That helmet was his one last chance for all the\nthings he had ever wanted and he would hold on to it as long as he had\nlife left. With that helmet he could be free of Bill Olger and D'ulio,\nthe Martian, and go back to Earth with more wealth than a space rat\nlike himself had ever brought back. It was now, he reflected, one month\nfrom the night he had met them, back in Venusport....\n\nMallard was sitting at a table in the Green Star the night they came\nin. Sitting there, drinking Sre, the raw native wine, and wondering if\nhe could afford another glass of the stuff. He was surrounded by the\nriff-raff of the spaceways and his nerves were raw from a week-long\nbout with the Sre.\n\nThe two men came in, looked the dingy place over for a moment, then\nmade directly for his table. They were both big men, the Earth man a\nred-haired giant with the cold eyes and the hard, ruthless face of\nthe space rat. Mallard had come to know plenty of men like him since\nhe had been kicked out of the Patrol. Hard, bitter men, shrewd and\nutterly conscienceless. The Martian beside him he hardly noticed.\nHis red, skeleton-like face was the typical Martian mask and Mallard\nwasted no time trying to form an estimate of him. No Earth man ever\nwould know what a Martian was like until he'd lived beside him for\nyears--sometimes not even then. And, anyway, Mallard wasn't too\ninterested in either of them. Not even when they came over and sat at\nhis table.\n\n\"I'm Bill Olger,\" the Earth man began without preliminaries. \"This\nis my friend, D'ulio, one of the smartest scientists Mars has ever\nproduced. We know about you. You're George Mallard, owner of the Space\nLark.\"\n\n\"If you're getting ready to make a touch you can save your breath,\"\nMallard said sourly. \"I haven't got a hundred credits to my name.\"\n\n\"We're not getting ready to make a touch, Mallard,\" Olger said. \"We're\ngetting ready to let you in on the chance of a lifetime. Now, do you\nwant to let us buy you a drink of something decent while we tell you\nabout it, or would you rather keep on sitting here alone drinking this\nslop?\"\n\nMallard looked from his hard face to the spidery red mask of the\nMartian, then shrugged his shoulders and pushed out his empty glass.\nOlger beckoned to the Venusian waiter and presently Mallard was sipping\na glass of pale green brandy that soothed his raw nerves like the\nalmost forgotten touch of an Earth woman's hands. Bill Olger yanked his\nchair closer and bent his head over the table.\n\n\"Look, Mallard, I'm not going to beat around the bush with you. I've\nkept pretty close tabs on you since you were kicked out of the Patrol\nand I know you're at the end of your rope. You've been picked up twice\nby the Patrol, on suspicion of piracy and, both times, you got away by\nthe skin of your teeth. So our proposition is made to order for you,\nif you've got as much nerve as I think you have. The proposition is\nrhizoids.\"\n\nMallard whistled softly. Rhizoids! Those incredible gems brought back\nfrom the fringes of the impenetrable swamp belt of Mercury. Gems that\ngrew, layer upon layer, like a pearl growing within an oyster, in the\nheart of a fungus shrub that looked like a dead, white stump. There\nwere less than a dozen of those gems in all the Galaxy and they were\nworth upwards of a hundred thousand credits each.\n\nMallard had seen one only once and that had been at a distance. It was\nworn by a Martian desert queen and he had never forgotten the exquisite\nbeauty of the thing. Even yards away he could see the sultry fires\nimprisoned in that incredible stone and it made every other jewel he\nhad ever seen look like a piece of cheap cut glass.\n\n\"Sounds very nice, Olger,\" he said slowly. \"There's just one little\ncatch to it. The fungus stumps where those things grow are loaded with\nspores and those spores are the deadliest things in all the System. A\nfriend of mine, First Mate on the Jupiter run, went on an expedition to\nbring back some of those rhizoids a few years back and he told me what\nit was like.\n\n\"They wear glassite suits while they're hacking the stumps apart to\nget at the rhizoids. The instant one of those stumps is touched it\nsends out a fine cloud of spores and when those spores settle down on\na glassite suit it looks like the man was covered by hoar frost. They\nthrow the suits away when they leave the scene.\n\n\"One of the men, this mate said, happened to step on a piece of one of\nthose stumps, after he'd gotten out of his glassite suit. I got kind of\nsick listening to the mate tell about what happened then. Ever see an\nEarth wasp sting another insect and then lay its eggs in that insect's\nbody, Olger? Well, it was like that. The man was paralyzed the minute\nthe spores settled on him and he started screaming. A couple of minutes\nand the spores had paralyzed his vocal chords and after that he stopped\nscreaming. He--well, he just kept screaming with his eyes, the mate\nsaid. They put a blaster to the poor devil's head before they left.\n\n\"That's what those spores are like, Olger, and I don't want any part of\nthem, thanks. I don't mind taking a chance on dying from a ray gun but\nthose rhizoids are only worth a hundred thousand credits apiece and I'd\nwant a hundred million before I'd take a chance on dying like that.\"\n\n\"And what if we could show you a chance to make your hundred million?\"\nBill Olger asked softly.\n\nMallard's fingers tightened around his glass. \"I'm listening.\"\n\n\"You see,\" Olger began slowly, \"the trouble up to now has been that\nno one could get those stones out of the fungus stumps unless he was\nprotected by a cumbersome glassite suit and the swamp belt is too dense\nto bring those suits into. That meant they could only pick up a few\nthey found growing around the rim of the belt. There are rumors that\nthe natives have found a way to handle the spores but they regard the\nfungus as sacred and won't help.\n\n\"But, a couple of years back the Galactic Colonization Board finally\nmanaged to get one of the plants back to Earth. It isn't generally\nknown but they really did it. They used a low powered force field and\nfinally worked it into a glassite cage. They kept it quiet because they\nlost three of their men getting the thing caged.\n\n\"When they got the fungus stump back to Earth they began to experiment\nwith it. They started coating white rats with different chemicals and\ncoverings, or injecting different drugs in them, and then sending them\ninto the cage with the thing. They used up an awful lot of white rats,\nMallard.\"\n\nGeorge Mallard shuddered. \"I can believe that.\"\n\n\"The main thing, though, the thing that matters to us, is that they put\nD'ulio, here, in charge of the experiments. And D'ulio had ideas of his\nown. He was just out of the Martian University and he just couldn't see\nany point in working for Terrans for the rest of his life for a small\nsalary.\n\n\"The second week D'ulio worked on the fungus stump he discovered\nthat the spores could be killed as fast as they were released by a\nplain, ordinary Overton ray. You remember the old Overton ray gun that\nwas used in the war against the Martian desert tribes? The gun was\noriginally meant to be rigged up on a ship but D'ulio made a smaller\nmodel that could be carried by two men and it worked on the spores as\nwell as a big gun.\n\n\"As soon as D'ulio was sure of his findings he opened the fungus stump,\ntook out the rhizoid from it, then 'accidentally' burned the stump to a\ncrisp. He reported that there was no rhizoid inside it. Sometimes they\ndon't have, you know, just as lots of pearls don't happen to be there\nwhen you open the oyster. He was fired for his carelessness. As soon as\nit was safe he contacted me. He knew I had ways of getting rid of the\nrhizoid that he didn't have. So, here we are. D'ulio has the equipment\nwe need. We have the money to finance the expedition--and you have the\nship. What do you say, Mallard?\"\n\n\"It would take the best part of fifty thousand credits to get the Space\nLark ready for a trip like that,\" Mallard said doubtfully.\n\n\"And I've got twice that, right here in my pocket, chum.\" Bill Olger\nreached into his pocket and handed something to Mallard under cover of\nthe table. Something that was smooth and round and hard. Mallard held\nit below the level of the table top and looked. Then he drew in his\nbreath as sharply as if he had been hit in the stomach.\n\nAt first glance, the thing looked like a large and very perfect Terran\nfire opal. But no opal ever gleamed with the unbelievably sultry fires\nthat lived in this stone. It looked as though every sun of the Galaxy\nwere imprisoned within its depths. George Mallard looked at the rhizoid\nin his hand for a moment longer, then turned to Bill Olger. When he\nspoke, his voice was shaky.\n\n\"We can be ready to blast off in forty-eight hours.\"\n\n\n\nThe Swamp Belt of Mercury! Mallard looked at the almost impenetrable\ngrowth of tangled fern trees and undergrowth and swore wearily. They\nhad been here for three weeks, now, and it had been three weeks of\npure, unadulterated hell. The dank, steamy air made every breath a\npainful effort and, day and night, giant insects made their life\nmiserable. They could take the miniature Overton ray gun a little way\ninto the swamp belt but at every step they had to be on the alert for\nthe great reptiles that floundered through the dense undergrowth. And\neven more, for the deadly plant life that lay in wait.\n\nAnd always they were under watch from the natives. Scaly-hided men,\nnot much past the anthropoid stage, but the crude wooden spears they\nused could be very dangerous. The Overton ray gun was scaled down to\nnear zero for use against the fungus stumps but it could be turned up\nto full power for its original use as a weapon. And the gun had saved\ntheir lives on more than one occasion when those wooden spears began to\nfly past them. It was a tense, miserable life.\n\nBut they did find the rhizoids. Not as many as they had hoped for,\nbecause the Overton gun could be taken into the swamp belt only a\nlittle way, but they found far, far more than had ever been brought out\nbefore. Day after day the tiny hoard of stones grew. Night after night\nthe three men sat around the cabin of the Space Lark, gloating over\nthem. At least Bill Olger and the Martian D'ulio did. Only Mallard was\nsullen and dissatisfied. Once he put his feelings into words.\n\n\"Look. You two are all steamed up because we've got a handful of these\nthings. A handful that's got to be divided three ways. Do you know\nhow long your share's going to last once you hit the bright lights in\nVenusport? Well, I'll tell you. A year, two years. Maybe three years\nif you're careful. You might be satisfied with that but I'm not. Me, I\nwant those hundreds of millions we were talking about when we started\nthis thing. Yes, and if I can figure out some way of getting further\ninto this damned swamp I'll get them, too.\"\n\nOlger looked at him in unconcealed disgust. \"I can understand a man\nbeing a bum loser, Mallard, but not a bum winner. You know that we've\nalready gone as far into the swamp belt as we can with the Overton and\nif you think I'm going into that hellhole without the ray gun, you're\ncrazy. It makes my skin crawl to think of the narrow escapes we've had,\neven with it. Be reasonable, fella.\"\n\nMallard nodded glumly. He knew, of course, that Olger was right, but\nthe nightly sight of the rhizoids, softly gleaming in his hands, was\nraising a fever in his brain that would not be stilled. If there was\nonly some way to establish contact with the natives, maybe get a guide.\nHe fondled the rhizoid in his fingers and stared thoughtfully at the\nsultry fires within its depths.\n\nThe next day he started making overtures to a native girl they had\ndubbed Tiny. The natives they had seen flitting about the swamp seemed\nto average around seven feet tall but Tiny was not much larger than\nan Earth girl. She seemed very young, barely out of her childhood,\nalthough they had no way of knowing the age of these natives. Like\nyoungsters of any race, she was filled with curiosity and she often\nhung around the outskirts of the camp after her tribesmen had been\ndriven away.\n\nMallard set to work winning her confidence the same way he would have\ndone with a wild animal. The first time she was alone he squatted down\non the ground and made encouraging sounds toward the fern tree behind\nwhich she hid. Then he took a piece of Earth candy from his pocket,\nnibbled at it, made sounds of delight, and threw it on the ground\nbefore her. He walked away and when he looked back and saw her pick up\nthe candy, he knew that he had made a start. In another two days, he\nwas squatting on the ground, a few feet from her, trying to learn the\nrudiments of her language.\n\nIt was no easy task he had set for himself. Her language was a series\nof barking consonants that were terribly hard for his Terran vocal\nchords to form and her thought processes were so primitive that it was\nlike trying to talk to a four-year-old child in a strange language.\n\nBut he did progress to the point where he could communicate simple\nideas to her. Then he made the mistake of telling her that he wanted\nto find more of the rhizoid bearing fungus. Many, many more of them.\nWhen she understood what he wanted, she ran away and he did not see her\nagain for nearly a week.\n\nAnd when he did see her again it was almost too late for her to be of\nany further use to him. He was prospecting alone, that day, Olger and\nD'ulio having set out to explore another section of the swamp belt. He\nhad gone only a little way into the swamp when he saw Tiny struggling,\nhalf mad with fear, in the grip of two burly natives. They were tying\nher with vines to a fallen log and another native was coming forward,\ncarrying something in his arms.\n\nSuddenly Mallard swore incredulously. The third native was carrying one\nof the white fungus stumps in his arms, carrying that deadly thing as\ncarelessly as he would have carried a stick of wood! And then Mallard\nsaw that he was wearing a helmet on his head, a metal helmet, ringed by\nsome sort of crystal stones. The helmet was pouring a protective flood\nof soft green light downward, completely covering the native's body. He\nseemed unharmed by the green light but the spores from the fungus stump\nwere shriveling the instant they were touched by the light.\n\nMallard leaped forward, then, his blaster spitting wildly. His first\nshot brought down the native with the helmet and the other two went\ndown a moment later. When he rushed forward and took the helmet off the\ndead native, Tiny cowered down on the ground, her child eyes rolling\nup fearfully at him. Mallard ignored her as he bent his head over the\nhelmet.\n\nThe thing was made of some purplish metal that was like nothing he\nhad ever seen anywhere in the System. Certainly it had never been\nconstructed by these primitive people and Mallard wondered briefly what\nalien race from what far distant star had left it here in these fetid\nswamps.\n\nBut he was too filled with wild exultation to waste much time in idle\nspeculation. The thing that mattered was that he now had a really\nperfect device for getting out the rhizoids. He alone had it! Let Olger\nand D'ulio keep their cumbersome Overton ray gun and squirm around the\nedge of the swamp belt with it. With this thing he could go deep inside\nthe belt and bring out all the rhizoids he could carry.\n\nAnd he was savagely determined to keep them when he brought them out.\nLet Bill Olger and D'ulio go back with him, carrying a basketful of\nthose wonderful stones? Why, within hours after they hit Venusport,\nhalf the riff-raff of the space lanes would know about their discovery\nand be heading for Mercury. No, when he lifted the Space Lark off\nMercury, Olger and the Martian simply wouldn't be aboard. The thought\nof murder raised no particular horror in his brain. He had killed\nbefore. He whirled about and looked down at the cowering native girl.\n\n\"You--belong me--now. You--take me--to these.\"\n\nHe showed her a couple of the rhizoids. Tiny looked back at the swamp\nbehind her and whimpered like a beaten puppy just once. Then she nodded\nher head slowly. Mallard grinned with satisfaction as he bent down to\ncut her loose.\n\n\n\nThe girl led Mallard back into the very heart of the swamp belt. The\njourney was sheer nightmare. Hour after hour they plodded on while\nMallard's body was soaked with sweat and his lungs seemed ready to\nburst from the steamy air. But the feel of those stones in his pocket\nsomehow kept him plodding along after the naked girl ahead of him.\nThose stones had magic in them.\n\nIt seemed long eons before he saw Tiny come to a halt and looked\nfearfully around her. From her evident fright, Mallard guessed she\nwas in a taboo place. She made a furtive gesture and he hurried up to\nher. He reached the spot where she stood and drew in his breath with a\nshuddering gasp.\n\nThe swamp had thinned out at this point and there before him was a\nwhole grove of the white fungus stumps! They stood in serried ranks,\nlike a yardful of ghosts and Mallard knew that within those white\nstumps there was a fortune that no space rat had ever dreamed of before.\n\nHe broke into a stumbling run forward, the girl completely forgotten.\nAt the edge of the grove he paused only a moment to make sure the\nshielding light of the helmet was properly adjusted. Then he swung his\nblade down upon one of the white stumps. It split easily and he drew\nforth a perfect rhizoid, larger than any they had found so far. For\na moment he held it shakily in his hand. Then he slipped it into the\nleather pouch he carried on his belt.\n\nIn little more than an hour Mallard had filled the pouch he carried. He\nwas working like a madman, now, the sweat pouring from him in torrents,\nand he was numb with fatigue but the fever in his brain swept away all\nthoughts of stopping.\n\nHe wanted more of these gleaming stones. He wanted to fill his pockets\nwith them, carry them away in his cupped hands. He was still moving\nforward on tottering feet when he heard Tiny scream. He whirled about\nsavagely, his hand darting to the small blaster at his belt.\n\nA tangled horde of Mercurian warriors was pouring out of the swamp into\nthe clearing. Their bestial faces were twisted with rage and their\nwooden spears raised menacingly. Even as Mallard turned and sprinted\nback, those wooden spears were flying past his head. He ducked down\nbehind a log, the native girl crouched, whimpering like a puppy, beside\nhim.\n\nMallard put the helmet and the bag of rhizoids down beside him and\nbegan picking off the scaly-hided warriors, one by one. He fired\ncarefully, anxious to conserve the remaining charges in his small hand\nblaster. In his mind was a new dread.\n\nHe knew that, long ago, Bill Olger and the Martian would have returned\nto the Space Lark and found him gone. They would immediately set out\nlooking for him and the sound of this fight would draw them to him.\nThey must not find him with his pouch full of rhizoids! Never would he\nshare those stones with any one else, that much he knew.\n\nSuddenly he saw something that caused him to open his eyes in stark\ndisbelief. One of the warriors in that milling throng was wearing\nanother helmet, an exact duplicate of the one lying beside him. And he\nwas carrying a fragment from one of those deadly fungus stumps in his\nhands! Holding it ready to hurl the moment he was close.\n\nMallard started to put on his own helmet, then realized that in his\nprone position it would not shield him. He let it lie and started\nfiring more rapidly, trying to reach the wearer of that helmet. He\nducked aside as one of the spears barely missed him and heard a moan of\nanguish from the girl beside him. One of the spears had gone into her\nside and blood was pouring from the wound.\n\nFrom out in the swamp, there was the sound of signal shots, followed\nby loud shouts. It was Olger and D'ulio and they were not far away.\nMallard began firing at top speed, now, and the Mercurians fell like\ntenpins. The moaning girl beside him he ignored. And then the whole\naction exploded into nightmare.\n\nThe Mercurian with the helmet stepped forward and called out a\nperemptory command to the girl. And she answered! Snatching up the\npouch of rhizoids, she jumped clear of the log and started hobbling\npainfully toward her own people. At the same moment, Mallard saw big\nOlger and D'ulio leap out into the clearing, guns drawn.\n\nFor one long moment, Mallard stared in horrified fascination at the\ngirl carrying away the thing that mattered more than life itself to\nhim. Then he had leaped clear of the log and was sprinting after her.\nAs in a slow motion picture, he saw Olger and D'ulio firing into the\ntangled mass and saw the helmeted Mercurian warrior raise the fragment\nof deadly white fungus.\n\nFor just a split part of a second he started to turn, to jump back and\nreach that protective helmet behind the log. But the limping girl was\nso close. Only another step. He reached forward for the leather pouch\nand the fungus landed directly at his feet!\n\nA cloud of fine spores lifted up like a puff of smoke and Mallard\nfelt pain greater than he had ever known man could experience. He\nfelt himself falling, literally pulled to the ground by the wave of\npain that was tightening every muscle in his body into an individual\nagonized knot. From a long way off he heard some one screaming and knew\nthat it was his own voice.\n\nMallard was no longer conscious of the action all around him. True, he\ncould dimly sense the horde of scaly-hided Mercurians rushing panic\nstricken past him and he could hear that monotonous screaming that was\nhis own voice. But the only thing that really existed for him was the\nhundreds of knots of agony in his own paralyzed body.\n\nThe only thing? From the corner of his eyes he could see the pouch of\nrhizoids lying almost touching him and he tried to force his agonized\nbody into one last effort to cover it before he called out to Olger\nand the Martian to put the helmet on him. That helmet would stop\nthe searing pain, yes, but if only he could hold out for one moment\nlonger--just one moment. Long enough to hide those glorious gems with\nhis body--\n\nHe tried and found that he could not move one inch. He gave up the\neffort and drew in one last breath to call out to them, to tell them to\nput the helmet on him.\n\nAnd he could not speak! The poison of the spores had already reached\nhis vocal chords.\n\nHe was still screaming with his eyes when the others came up to him.",
