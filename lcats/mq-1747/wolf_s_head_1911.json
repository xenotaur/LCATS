    "body": "By Charles Egbert Craddock\n\n1911\n\n\nIt might well be called the country of the outlaw, this vast tract of\ndense mountain forests and craggy ravines, this congeries of swirling\ntorrents and cataracts and rapids. Here wild beasts lurked out their\nsavage lives, subsisting by fang and prey,--the panther, the bear, the\ncatamount, the wolf,--and like unto them, ferocious and fugitive, both\nfearsome and afraid, the man with a \"wolf's head,\" on which was set a\nprice, even as the State's bounty for the scalps of the ravening brutes.\n\nOne gloomy October afternoon, the zest of a group of sportsmen, who had\npitched their camp in this sequestered wilderness, suffered an abatement\non the discovery of the repute of the region and the possibility of\nbeing summoned to serve on a sheriff's posse in the discharge of the\ngrimmest of duties.\n\n\"But he is no outlaw in the proper sense of the term. The phrase has\nsurvived, but the fact is obsolete,\" said Seymour, who was both a prig\nand a purist, a man of leisure, and bookish, but a good shot, and vain\nof his sylvan accomplishments. \"Our law places no man beyond the pale\nof its protection. He has a constitutional right to plead his case in\ncourt.\"\n\n\"What is the reward offered to hale him forth and force him to enjoy\nthat privilege--five hundred dollars?\" asked Bygrave, who was a\nnewspaper man and had a habit of easy satire.\n\n\"Of course he would never suffer himself to be taken alive.\" Purcell's\nvocation was that of a broker, and he was given to the discrimination\nof chances and relative values. \"Therefore he is as definitely _caput\nlupinum_ as any outlaw of old. Nobody would be held accountable for\ncracking his 'wolf's head' off, in the effort to arrest him for the sake\nof the five hundred dollars. But, meantime, how does the fellow contrive\nto live!\"\n\n\"Jes by his rifle, I reckon,\" replied the rural gossip whom intrusive\ncuriosity occasionally lured to their camp-fire. \"Though sence that thar\nbig reward hev been n'ised abroad, I'd think he'd be plumb afraid ter\nfire a shot. The echoes be mighty peart these dumb, damp fall days.\"\n\nThe old jeans-clad mountaineer had a certain keen spryness of aspect,\ndespite his bent knees and stooped shoulders. His deeply grooved,\nnarrow, thin face was yet more elongated by the extension of a high\nforehead into a bald crown, for he wore his broad wool hat on the back\nof his head. There was something in his countenance not dissimilar to\nthe facial contour of a grasshopper, and the suggestion was heightened\nby his persistent, rasping chirp.\n\n\"That's what frets Meddy; she can't abide the idee of huntin' a human\nwith sech special coursers ez money reward. She 'lows it mought tempt\na' evil man or a' ignorant one ter swear a miser'ble wretch's life\naway. Let the law strengthen its own hands--that's what Meddy say. Don't\nkindle the sperit of Cain in every brother's breast. Oh, Meddy is plumb\ncomical whenst she fairly gits ter goin', though it's all on account of\nthat thar man what war growed up in a tree.\"\n\nThe dryadic suggestions of a dendroidal captivity flashed into Seymour's\nmind with the phrase, and stimulated his curiosity as to some quaint\nrural perversion of the legend.\n\nBut it was grim fact that the old mountaineer detailed in answer to the\nquestion, as he sat on a log by the fire, while the sportsmen lay on the\nground about it and idly listened.\n\n\"One day--'t war 'bout two year' ago--thar war a valley-man up hyar\na-huntin' in the mountings with some other fellers, an' toward sunset\nhe war a-waitin' at a stand on a deer-path up thar nigh Headlong Creek,\nhopin' ter git a shot whenst the deer went down to drink. Waal, I reckon\nluck war ag'in' him, fer he got nuthin' but durned tired. So, ez he\nwaited, he grounded his rifle, an' leaned himself ag'in' a great big\ntree ter rest his bones. And presently he jes happened ter turn his\nhead, an', folks! he seen a sight! Fer thar, right close ter his cheek,\nhe looked into a skellington's eye-sockets. Thar war a skellington's\ngrisly face peerin' at him through a crack in the bark.\"\n\nThe raconteur suddenly stopped short, while the group remained silent\nin expectancy. The camp-fire, with its elastic, leaping flames, had\nbepainted the darkening avenues of the russet woods with long, fibrous\nstrokes of red and yellow, as with a brush scant of color. The autumnal\nair was dank, with subtle shivers. A precipice was not far distant on\nthe western side, and there the darksome forest fell away, showing above\nthe massive, purple mountains a section of sky in a heightened clarity\nof tint, a suave, saffron hue, with one horizontal bar of vivid\nvermilion that lured the eye. The old mountaineer gazed retrospectively\nat it as he resumed:\n\n\"Waal, sirs, that town-man had never consorted with sech ez\nskellingtons. He lit out straight! He made tracks! He never stopped till\nhe reached Colbury, an' thar he told his tale. Then the sheriff he tuk\na hand in the game. Skellingtons, he said, didn't grow on trees\nspontaneous, an' he hed an official interes' in human relics out o'\nplace. So he kem,--the tree is 'twixt hyar an' my house thar on the\nrise,--an', folks! the tale war plain. Some man chased off 'n the face\nof the yearth, hid out from the law,--that's the way Meddy takes it,--he\nhed clomb the tree, an' it bein' holler, he drapped down inside it,\nthinkin' o' course he could git out the way he went in. But, no! It\nmonght hev been deeper 'n he calculated, or mo' narrow, but he couldn't\nmake the rise. He died still strugglin', fer his long, bony fingers war\ngripped in the wood--it's rotted a deal sence then.\"\n\n\"Who was the man?\" asked Seymour.\n\n\"Nobody knows,--nobody keers 'cept' Meddy. She hev wep' a bushel o'\ntears about him. The cor'ner 'lowed from the old-fashioned flint-lock\nrifle he hed with him that it mus' hev happened nigh a hunderd years\nago. Meddy she will git ter studyin' on that of a winter night, an' how\nthe woman that keered fer him mus' hev watched an' waited fer him, an'\n'lowed he war deceitful an' de-sertin', an' mebbe held a gredge agin\nhim, whilst he war dyin' so pitiful an' helpless, walled up in that\ntree. Then Meddy will tune up agin, an' mighty nigh cry her eyes out.\nHe warn't even graced with a death-bed ter breathe his last; Meddy air\npartic'lar afflicted that he hed ter die afoot.\" Old Kettison glanced\nabout the circle, consciously facetious, his heavily grooved face\ndistended in a mocking grin.\n\n\"A horrible fate!\" exclaimed Seymour, with a half-shudder.\n\n\"Edzac'ly,\" the old mountaineer assented easily.\n\n\"What's her name--Meggy?\" asked the journalist, with a mechanical\naptitude for detail, no definite curiosity.\n\n\"Naw; Meddy--short fer Meddlesome. Her right name is Clementina Haddox;\nbut I reckon every livin' soul hev forgot' it but me. She is jes\nMeddlesome by name, an' meddlesome by natur'.\"\n\nHe suddenly turned, gazing up the steep, wooded slope with an expectant\nmien, for the gentle rustling amidst the dense, red leaves of the\nsumac-bushes heralded an approach.\n\n\"That mus' be Meddy now,\" he commented, \"with her salt-risin' bread. She\nlowed she war goin' ter fetch you-uns some whenst I tol' her you-uns war\nlackin'.\"\n\nFor the camp-hunt had already been signalized by divers disasters: the\nstore of loaves in the wagon had been soaked by an inopportune shower;\nthe young mountaineer who had combined the offices of guide and cook was\nthe victim of an accidental discharge of a fowling-piece, receiving a\nload of bird-shot full in his face. Though his injury was slight, he had\nreturned home, promising to supply his place by sending his brother, who\nhad not yet arrived. Purcell's boast that he could bake ash-cake proved\na bluff, and although the party could and did broil bacon and even birds\non the coals, they were reduced to the extremity of need for the staff\nof life.\n\nHence they were predisposed in the ministrant's favor as she appeared,\nand were surprised to find that Meddlesome, instead of masterful and\nmiddle-aged, was a girl of eighteen, looking very shy and appealing as\nshe paused on the verge of the flaring sumac copse, one hand lifted to\na swaying bough, the other arm sustaining a basket. Even her coarse gown\nlent itself to pleasing effect, since its dull-brown hue composed well\nwith the red and russet glow of the leaves about her, and its short\nwaist, close sleeves, and scant skirt, reaching to the instep, the\nimmemorial fashion of the hills, were less of a grotesque rusticity\nsince there was prevalent elsewhere a vogue of quasi-Empire modes, of\nwhich the cut of her garb was reminiscent. A saffron kerchief about her\nthroat had in its folds a necklace of over-cup acorns in three strands,\nand her hair, meekly parted on her forehead, was of a lustrous brown,\nand fell in heavy undulations on her shoulders. There was a delicate but\ndistinct tracery of bine veins in her milky-white complexion, and she\nmight have seemed eminently calculated for meddling disastrously with\nthe peace of mind of the mountain youth were it not for the preoccupied\nexpression of her eyes. Though large, brown and long-lashed, they were\nfull of care and perplexity, and a frowning, disconcerted line between\nher eye-brows was so marked as almost to throw her face out of drawing.\nTroubled about many things, evidently, was Meddlesome. She could not\neven delegate the opening of a basket that her little brother had\nbrought and placed beside the camp-fire.\n\n\"Don't, Gran'dad,\" she exclaimed suddenly, stepping alertly\nforward--\"_don't_ put that loaf in that thar bread-box; the box 'pears\nter be damp. Leave the loaf in the big basket till ter-morrer. It'll\neat shorter then, bein' fraish-baked. They kin hev these biscuits fer\nsupper,\"--dropping on one knee and setting forth on the cloth, from the\nbasket on her arm, some thick soggy-looking lumps of dough,--\"I baked\nsome dodgers, too--four, six, eight, ten,\"--she was counting a dozen\ngolden-brown cates of delectable aspect--\"knowin' they would hone fer\ncornmeal arter huntin', an' nuthin' else nohow air fitten ter eat with\nfeesh or aigs. Hev you-uns got any aigs!\" She sprang up, and, standing\non agile tiptoe, peered without ceremony into their wagon. Instantly\nshe recoiled with a cry of horrified reproach. \"Thar 's ants in yer\nshort-sweetenin'! How _could_ you-uns let sechez that happen!\"\n\n\"Oh, surely not,\" exclaimed Purcell, hastening to her side. But the fact\ncould not be gainsaid; the neglected sugar was spoiled.\n\nMeddlesome's unwarranted intrusion into the arcana of their domestic\nconcerns disclosed other shortcomings. \"Why n't ye keep the top on yer\ncoffee-can? Don't ye know the coffee will lose heart, settin' open?\" She\nrepaired this oversight with a deft touch, and then proceeded: \"We-uns\nain't got no short-sweetenin' at our house, but I'll send my leetle\nbrother ter fetch some long-sweetenin' fer yer coffee ter night. Hyar,\nSol,\"--addressing the small, limber, tow-headed, barefooted boy, a\nludicrous miniature of a man in long, loose, brown-jeans trousers\nsupported by a single suspender over an unbleached cotton shirt,--\"run\nter the house an' fetch the sorghum-jug.\"\n\nAs Sol started off with the alertness of a scurrying rabbit, she shrilly\ncalled out in a frenzy of warning: \"Go the other way, Sol--up through\nthe pawpaws! Them cherty rocks will cut yer feet like a knife.\"\n\nSol had nerves of his own. Her sharp cry had caused him to spring\nprecipitately backward, frightened, but uncomprehending his danger.\nBeing unhurt, he was resentful' \"They ain't none o' _yer_ feet, nohow,\"\nhe grumbled, making a fresh start at less speed.\n\n\"Oh, yes, Sol,\" said the old grandfather, enjoying the contretemps and\nthe sentiment of revolt against Meddlesome's iron rule. \"Everything\nbelongs ter Meddlesome one way or another, 'ca'se she jes makes it\nhern. So take keer of _yer_ feet for _her_ sake.\" He turned toward her\njocosely as the small emissary disappeared among the undergrowth. \"I jes\nbeen tellin' these hunter-men, Meddy, 'bout how ye sets yerself even\nter meddle with other folkses' mourning--what they got through with a\nhunderd year' ago--tormentatin' 'bout that thar man what war starved in\nthe tree.\"\n\nShe heard him, doubtless, for a rising flush betokened her deprecation\nof this ridicule in the presence of these strangers. But it was rather\nthat she remembered his words afterward than heeded them now. It would\nseem that certain incidents, insignificant in themselves, are the pivots\non which turns the scheme of fate. She could not imagine that upon her\naction in the next few seconds depended grave potentialities in more\nlives than one. On the contrary, her deliberations were of a trivial\nsubject, even ludicrous in any other estimation than her own.\n\nSol was small, she argued within herself, the jug was large and sticky.\nHe might be tempted to lighten it, for Sol had saccharine predilections,\nand the helpless Jug was at his mercy. Sol had scant judgment and one\nsuit of clothes available; the other, sopping wet from the wash, now\nswayed in the process of drying on an elder-bush in the dooryard. Should\nhis integrity succumb, and the jug tilt too far, the stream of sorghum\nmight inundate his raiment, and the catastrophe would place him beyond\nthe pale of polite society. The seclusion of bed would be the only place\nfor Sol till such time as the elder-bush should bear the fruit of dry\nclothes.\n\n\"Poor Sol!\" she exclaimed, her prophetic sympathy bridging the chasm\nbetween possibility and accomplished fact. \"I'll fetch the jug myself.\nI'll take the short cut an' head him.\"\n\nThus she set her feet in the path of her future. It led her into dense,\ntangled woods, clambering over outcropping ledges and boulders. By the\nflare of the west she guided her progress straight to the east till she\nreached the banks of Headlong Creek on its tumultuous course down the\nmountainside. In her hasty enterprise she had not counted on crossing\nit, but Meddlesome rarely turned back. She was strong and active, and\nafter a moment's hesitation, she was springing from one to another of\nthe great, half-submerged boulders amidst the whirl of the transparent\ncrystal-brown water, with its fleck and fringe of white foam. More\nthan once, to evade the dizzying effect of the sinuous motion and the\ncontinuous roar, she stood still in midstream and gazed upward or at the\nopposite bank. The woods were dense on the slope. All in red and yellow\nand variant russet and brown tints, the canopy of the forest foliage was\nimpenetrable. The great, dark boles of oak and gum and spruce contrasted\nsharply with the white and greenish-gray trunks of beeches and\nsycamore and poplar, and, thus breaking the monotony, gave long, almost\nillimitable avenues of sylvan vistas. She noted amidst a growth of\nwillows on the opposite bank, at the waters-edge, a spring, a circular,\nrock-bound reservoir; in the marshy margin she could see the imprints of\nthe cleft hoofs of deer, and thence ran the indefinite trail known as\na deer-path. The dense covert along the steep slope was a famous\n\"deer-stand,\" and there many a fine buck had been killed. All at once\nshe was reminded of the storied tree hard by, the tragedy of which she\nhad often bewept.\n\nThere it stood, dead itself, weird, phantasmal, as befitted the housing\nof so drear a fate. Its branches now bore no leaves. The lightnings of\na last-year's storm had scorched out its vital force and riven the fibre\nof the wood. Here and there, too, the tooth of decay had gnawed fissures\nthat the bark had not earlier known; and from one of these--she thought\nherself in a dream--a ghastly, white face looked out suddenly, and as\nsuddenly vanished!\n\nHer heart gave one wild plunge, then it seemed to cease to beat She\nwondered afterward that she did not collapse, and sink into the plunging\nrapids to drown, beaten and bruised against the rocks. It was a\nmuscular instinct that sustained her rather than a conscious impulse of\nself-preservation. Motionless, horrified, amazed, she could only gaze\nat the empty fissure of the tree on the slope. She could not then\ndiscriminate the wild, spectral imaginations that assailed her untutored\nmind. She could not remember these fantasies later. It was a relief\nso great that the anguish of the physical reaction was scarcely less\npoignant than the original shock when she realized that this face\nwas not the grisly skeleton lineaments that had looked out thence\nheretofore, but was clothed with flesh, though gaunt, pallid, furtive.\nOnce more, as she gazed, it appeared in a mere glimpse at the fissure,\nand in that instant a glance was interchanged. The next moment a hand\nappeared,--beckoning her to approach.\n\nIt was a gruesome mandate. She had scant choice. She did not doubt that\nthis was the fugitive, the \"wolf's head,\" and should she turn to flee,\nhe could stop her progress with a pistol-ball, for doubtless he would\nfancy her alert to disclose the discovery and share in the reward.\nPerhaps feminine curiosity aided fear; perhaps only her proclivity to\nfind an employ in the management of others influenced her decision;\nthough trembling in every fibre, she crossed the interval of water, and\nmade her way up the slope. But when she reached the fateful tree it was\nshe who spoke first. He cast so ravenous a glance at the basket on her\narm that all his story of want and woe was revealed. Starvation had\ninduced his disclosure of his identity.\n\n\"It's empty,\" she said, inverting the basket. She watched him flinch,\nand asked wonderingly, \"Is game skeerce?\"\n\nHis eyes were at once forlorn and fierce. \"Oh, yes, powerful skeerce,\"\nhe replied with a bitter laugh.\n\nThere was an enigma in the rejoinder; she did not stay to read the\nriddle, but went on to possess the situation, according to her wont. \"Ye\nhev tuk a powerful pore place ter hide,\" she admonished him. \"This tree\nis a plumb cur'osity. Gran'dad Kettison war tellin' some camp-hunters\n'bout'n it jes this evenin'. Like ez not they'll kem ter view it.\"\n\nHis eyes dilated with a sudden accession of terror that seemed always\na-smoulder. \"Lawd, Lawd, Lawd!\" he moaned wretchedly.\n\nMeddlesome was true to her name and tradition. \"Ye oughter hev\nremembered the Lawd 'fore ye done it,\" she said, with a repellent\nimpulse; then she would have given much to recall the reproach. The man\nwas desperate; his safety lay in her silence. A pistol-shot would secure\nit, and anger would limber the trigger.\n\nBut he did not seem indignant. His eyes, intelligent and feverishly\nbright, gazed down at her only in obvious dismay and surprise. \"Done\nwhat?\" he asked, and as, prudence prevailing for once, she did not\nreply, he spoke for her. \"The murder, ye mean? Why, gal, I warn't even\nthar. I knowed nuthin' 'bout it till later. Ez God is my helper and my\nhope, I warn't even thar.\"\n\nShe stood astounded. \"Then why n't ye leave it ter men?\"\n\n\"I can't _prove_ it ag'in' the murderers' oaths. I had been consarned\nin the moonshinin' that ended in murder, but _I_ hed not been nigh the\nstill fer a month,--I war out a-huntin'--when the revenuers made the\nraid. There war a scrimmage 'twixt the raiders an' the distillers, an'\nan outsider that hed nuthin' ter do with the Federal law--he war the\nconstable o' the deestrick, an' jes rid with the gang ter see the fun\nor ter show them the way--he war killed. An' account o' _him_, the State\nlaw kem into the game. Them other moonshiners war captured, an' they\nswore ag'in' me 'bout the shootin' ter save tharselves, but I hearn thar\nfalse oaths hev done them no good, they being held as accessory. An' I\nbe so ez I can't prove an alibi--I can't _prove_ it, though it's God's\ntruth. But before high heaven\"--he lifted his gaunt right hand--\"I am\ninnercent, I am inner-cent.\"\n\nShe could not have said why,--perhaps she realized afterward,--but\nshe believed him absolutely, implicitly. A fervor of sympathy for his\nplight, of commiseration, surged up in her heart. \"I wisht it war so I\ncould gin ye some pervisions,\" she sighed, \"though ye do 'pear toler'ble\ntriflin' ter lack game.\"\n\nThen the dread secret was told. \"Gal,\"--he used the word as a polite\nform of address, the equivalent of the more sophisticated \"lady,\"--\"ef\nye will believe me, all my ammunition is spent. Not a ca'tridge lef',\nnot a dust of powder.\"\n\nMeddy caught both her hands to her lips to intercept and smother a cry\nof dismay.\n\n\"I snared a rabbit two days ago in a dead-fall. My knife-blade is bruk,\nbut I reckon thar is enough lef' ter split my jugular whenst the eend is\nkem at last.\"\n\nThe girl suddenly caught her faculties together. \"What sorter fool talk\nis that!\" she demanded sternly.' \"Ye do my bid, ef ye knows what's good\nfer ye. Git out'n this trap of a tree an' hide 'mongst the crevices\nof the rocks till seben o 'clock ternight. Then kem up ter Gran'dad\nKettison's whenst it is cleverly dark an' tap on the glass winder--not\non the batten shutter. An' I'll hev cartridges an' powder an' ball for\nye' an' some victuals ready, too.\"\n\nBut the fugitive, despite his straits, demurred. \"I don't want ter git\nold man Kettison into trouble for lendin' ter me.\"\n\n\"'T ain't his'n. 'T is my dad's old buckshot ca'tridges an' powder an'\nball. They belong ter me. The other childern is my half-brothers, bein'\nmy mother war married twice. Ye kin _steal_ this gear from me, ef that\nwill make ye feel easier.\"\n\n\"But what will yer gran'dad say ter me?\" \"He won't know who ye be; he\nwill jes 'low ye air one o' the boys who air always foolin' away thar\ntime visitin' me an' makin' tallow-dips skeerce.\" The sudden gleam\nof mirth on her face was like an illuminating burst of sunshine, and\nsomehow it cast an irradiation into the heart of the fugitive, for,\nafter she was gone out of sight, he pondered upon it.\n\nBut the early dusk fell from a lowering sky, and the night came on\nbeclouded and dark. Some turbulent spirit was loosed in the air, and the\nwind was wild. Great, surging masses of purple vapor came in a mad rout\nfrom the dank west and gathered above the massive and looming mountains.\nThe woods bent and tossed and clashed their boughs in the riot, of\ngusts, the sere leaves were flying in clouds, and presently rain began\nto fall. The steady downpour increased in volume to torrents; then the\nbroad, pervasive flashes of lightning showed, in lieu of myriad lines,\nan unbroken veil of steely gray swinging from the zenith, the white foam\nrebounding as the masses of water struck the earth. The camp equipage,\ntents and wagons succumbed beneath the fury of the tempest, and, indeed,\nthe hunters had much ado to saddle their horses and grope their way\nalong the bridle-path that led to old Kettison's house.\n\nThe rude comfort of the interior had a heightened emphasis by reason\nof the elemental turmoils without. True, the rain beat in a deafening\nfusillade upon the roof, and the ostentation of the one glass window, a\nsource of special pride to its owner, was at a temporary disadvantage in\nadmitting the fierce and ghastly electric glare, so recurrent as to seem\nunintermittent. But the more genial illumination of hickory flames, red\nand yellow, was streaming from the great chimney-place, and before\nthe broad hearth the guests were ensconced, their outstretched boots\nsteaming in the heat. Strings of scarlet peppers, bunches of dried\nherbs, gourds of varied quaint shapes, hung swaying from the rafters.\nThe old man's gay, senile chirp of welcome was echoed by his wife,\na type of comely rustic age, who made much of the fact that, though\nhousebound from \"rheumatics,\" she had reared her dead daughter's \"two\norphin famblies,\" the said daughter having married twice, neither man\n\"bein' of a lastin' quality,\" as she seriously phrased it. Meddy, \"the\neldest fambly,\" had been guide, philosopher, and friend to the swarm\nof youngsters, and even now, in the interests of peace and space and\nhearing, was seeking to herd them into an adjoining room, when a sudden\nstentorian hail from without rang through the splashing of the rain from\nthe eaves, the crash of thunder among the \"balds\" of the mountains, with\nits lofty echoes, and the sonorous surging of the wind.\n\n\"Light a tallow-dip, Meddy,\" cried old Kettison, excitedly. \"An' fetch\nthe candle on the porch so ez we-uns kin view who rides so late in sech\na night 'fore we bid 'em ter light an' hitch.\"\n\nBut these were travelers not to be gainsaid--the sheriff of the county\nand four stout fellows from the town of Colbury, summoned to his aid as\na posse, all trooping in as if they owned the little premises. However,\nthe officer permitted himself to unbend a trifle under the influence of\na hospitable tender of home-made cherry-bounce, \"strong enough to walk\nfrom here to Colbury,\" according to the sheriff's appreciative phrase.\nHe was a portly man, with a rolling, explanatory cant of his burly head\nand figure toward his interlocutor as he talked. His hair stood up in\ntwo tufts above his forehead, one on each side, and he had large, round,\ngrayish eyes and a solemn, pondering expression. To Meddy, staring\nhorror-stricken, he seemed as owlishly wise as he looked while he\nexplained the object of his expedition.\n\n\"This district have got a poor reputation with the law, Mr. Kettison.\nHere is this fellow, Boyston McGurny, been about here two years, and a\nreward for five hundred dollars out for his arrest.\"\n\n\"That's Boy's fault, Sher'ff, not our'n,\" leered the glib old man. He,\ntoo, had had a sip of the stalwart cherry-bounce. \"Boy's in no wise\nsociable.\"\n\n\"It's plumb flying in the face of the law,\" declared the officer. \"If\nI had a guide, I'd not wait a minute, or if I could recognize the man\nwhenst I viewed him. The constable promised to send a fellow to meet me\nhere,--what's his name!--yes, Smith, Barton Smith,--who will guide us to\nwhere he was last glimpsed. I hope to take him alive.\" he added with an\ninflection of doubt.\n\nCertainly this was a dreary camp-hunt, with all its distasteful\nsequelae. Purcell, who had no more imagination than a promissory note,\nsilently sulked under the officer's intimation that, being able-bodied\nmen, he would expect the hunters also to ride with him. They were not of\nhis county, and doubted their obligation, but they would not refuse\nto aid the law. Bygrave, however, realized a \"story\" in the air, and\nSeymour was interested in the impending developments; for being a close\nobserver, he had perceived that the girl was in the clutch of some\ntumultuous though covert agitation. Her blood blazed at fever-heat in\nher cheeks; her eyes were on fire; every muscle was tense; and her brain\nwhirled. To her the crisis was tremendous. This was the result of her\nunwarranted interference. Who was she, indeed, that she should seek\nto command the march of events and deploy sequences? Her foolish\nmaneuvering had lured this innocent man to ruin, capture, anguish,\nand death. No warning could he have; the window was opaque with the\ncorrugations of the rainfall on the streaming panes, and set too high\nto afford him a glimpse from without. And, oh, how he would despise\nthe traitor that she must needs seem to be! She had not a moment for\nreflection, for counsel, for action. Already the signal,--he was prompt\nat the tryst,--the sharp, crystalline vibration of the tap on the glass!\n\nThe sheriff rose instantly with that cumbrous agility sometimes\ncharacterizing portly men. \"There he is now!\" he exclaimed.\n\nBut Meddy, with a little hysterical cry, had sprung first to the opening\ndoor. \"Barton Smith!\" she exclaimed, with shrill significance. \"Hyar is\nyer guide, Sher'ff, wet ez a drownded rat.\"\n\nThe pale face in the dark aperture of the doorway, as the fire-light\nflashed on it, grew ghastly white with terror and lean with amazement.\nFor a moment the man seemed petrified. Seymour, vaguely fumbling with\nhis suspicions, began to disintegrate the plot of the play, and to\ndiscriminate the powers of the dramatis personae.\n\n\"Now, my man, step lively,\" said the officer in his big, husky voice.\n\"Do you know this Royston McGurny?\"\n\nTo be sure, Seymour had no cause for suspicion but his own intuition and\nthe intangible evidence of tone and look all as obvious to the others as\nto him. But he was at once doubtful and relieved when the haggard wretch\nat the door, mustering his courage, replied: \"Know Royston McGurny! None\nbetter. Knowed him all my life.\"\n\n\"Got pretty good horse?\"\n\n\"Got none at all; expect ter borry Mr. Kettison's.\"\n\n\"I'll go show ye whar the saddle be,\" exclaimed Meddy, with her wonted\nofficious-ness, and glibly picking up the bits of her shattered scheme.\nSeymour fully expected they would not return from the gloom without,\nwhither they had disappeared, but embrace the immediate chance of escape\nbefore the inopportune arrival of the real Barton Smith should balk the\npossibility. But, no,--and he doubted anew all his suspicions,--in\na trice here they both were again, a new courage, a new hope in that\npallid, furtive face, and another horse stood saddled among the equine\ngroup at the door. Meddlesome was pinning up the brown skirt of her\ngown, showing a red petticoat that had harmonies with a coarse, red\nplaid shawl adjusted over her head and shoulders.\n\n\"Gran'dad,\" she observed, never looking up, and speaking with her mouth\nfull of pins, \"Barton Smith say he kin set me down at Aunt Drusina's\nhouse. Ye know she be ailin', an' sent for me this evenin'; but I hed no\nway ter go.\"\n\nThe sheriff looked sour enough at this intrusion; but he doubtless\nimagined that this relative was no distant neighbor, and as he had need\nof hearty aid and popular support, he offered no protest.\n\nThere was a clearing sky without, and the wind was laid. The frenzy\nof the storm was over, although rain was still falling. The little\ncavalcade got to horse deliberately enough amid the transparent dun\nshadows and dim yellow flare of light from open door and window. One\nof the mounts had burst a girth, and a strap must be procured from\nthe plow-gear in the shed. Another, a steed of some spirit, reared and\nplunged at the lights, and could not be induced to cross the illuminated\nbar thrown athwart the yard from the open door. The official impatience\nof the delay was expressed in irritable comments and muttered oaths; but\nthroughout the interval the guide, with his pallid, strained face,\nsat motionless in his saddle, his rifle across its pommel, an apt\npresentment of indifference, while, perched behind him, Meddy was\ncontinually busy in readjusting her skirts or shawl or a small bundle\nthat presumably contained her rustic finery, but which, to a close\napproach, would have disclosed the sulphurous odor of gunpowder. When\nthe cluster of horsemen was fairly on the march, however, she sat quite\nstill, and more than once Seymour noted that, with her face close to\nthe shoulder of the guide, she was whispering in his ear. What was their\ngarnet he marvelled, having once projected the idea that this late comer\nwas, himself, the \"wolf's head\" whom they were to chase down for a rich\nreward, incongruously hunting amidst his own hue and cry. Or, Seymour\nagain doubted, had he merely constructed a figment of a scheme from his\nown imaginings and these attenuations of suggestion? For there seemed,\nafter all, scant communication between the two, and this was even less\nwhen the moon was unveiled, the shifting shimmer of the clouds\nfalling away from the great sphere of pearl, gemming the night with\nan incomparable splendor. It had grown almost as light as day, and the\nsheriff ordered the pace quickened. Along a definite cattle-trail they\nwent at first, but presently they were following through bosky recesses\na deer-path, winding sinuously at will on the way to water. The thinning\nfoliage let in the fair, ethereal light, and all the sylvan aisles\nstood in sheeny silver illumination. The drops of moisture glittered\njewel-wise on the dark boughs of fir and pine, and one could even\ndiscriminate the red glow of sour-wood and the golden flare of hickory,\nso well were the chromatic harmonies asserted in this refined and\nrefulgent glamour.\n\n\"Barton Smith!\" called the sheriff, suddenly from the rear of the party.\nThere was no answer, and Seymour felt his prophetic blood run cold.\nHis conscience began to stir. Had he, indeed, no foundation for his\nsuspicion?\n\n\"Smith! _Smith_\" cried the irascible officer. \"Hey, there! Is the man\ndeaf!\"\n\n\"Not deef, edzac'ly,\" Meddlesome's voice sounded reproachfully; \"jes a\nleetle hard o' hear in'.\" She had administered a warning nudge.\n\n\"Hey? What ye want?\" said the \"Wolf's Head,\" suddenly checking his\nhorse.\n\n\"Have you any idea of where you are going, or how far?\" demanded the\nofficer, sternly.\n\n\"Just acrost the gorge,\" the guide answered easily.\n\n\"I heard he had been glimpsed in a hollow tree. That word was telephoned\nfrom the cross-roads to town. It was the tree the skeleton was in.\"\n\n\"That tree? It's away back yander,\" observed one of the posse, reluctant\nand disaffected.\n\n\"Oh, he has quit that tree; he is bound for up the gorge now,\" said the\nguide.\n\n\"Well, I suppose you know, from what I was told,\" said the sheriff,\ndiscontentedly; \"but this is a long ja'nt. Ride up! Ride up!\"\n\nOnward they fared through the perfumed woods. The wild asters were\nblooming, and sweet and subtile distillations of the autumnal growths\nwere diffused on the air. The deer are but ill at road-making,--such\ntangled coverts, such clifty ledges, such wild leaps; for now the path\nthreaded the jagged verge of precipices. The valley, a black abyss above\nwhich massive, purplish mountains loomed against a sky of pearly tints,\nwas visibly narrowing. They all knew that presently it would become a\nmere gorge, a vast indentation in the mountain-side. The weird vistas\nacross the gorge were visible how, craggy steeps, and deep woods\nfilled with moonlight, with that peculiar untranslated intendment which\ndifferentiates its luminosity in the wilderness from the lunar glamour\n'of cultivated Scenes--something weird, melancholy, eloquent of a\nmeaning addressed to the soul, but which the senses cannot entertain or\nwords express.\n\nWith a sudden halt, the guide dismounted. The girl still sat on the\nsaddle-blanket, and the horse bowed his head and pawed. The posse were\ngazing dubiously, reluctantly, at a foot-bridge across a deep abyss. It\nwas only a log, the upper side hewn, with a shaking hand-rail held by\nslight standards.\n\n\"Have we got to cross this?\" asked the officer, still in the saddle and\ngazing downward.\n\n\"Ef ye foller me,\" said the guide, indifferently.\n\nBut he was ahead of his orders. He visibly braced his nerves for the\neffort, and holding his rifle as a balancing-pole, he sped along the\nlight span with a tread as deft as a fox or a wolf. In a moment he had\ngained the farther side.\n\nThey scarcely knew how it happened. So unexpected was the event that,\nthough it occurred before their eyes, they did not seem to see it. They\nremembered, rather than perceived, that he stooped suddenly; with one\nsingle great effort of muscular force he dislodged the end of the\nlog, heaved it up in the air, strongly flung it aside, whence it went\ncrashing down into the black depths below, its own weight, as it fell,\nsufficing to wrench out the other end, carrying with it a mass of earth\nand rock from the verge of the precipice.\n\nThe horses sprang back snorting and frightened; the officer's, being a\nfine animal in prime condition, tried to bolt. Before he had him well\nin hand again, the man on the opposite brink had vanished. The sheriff's\nsuspicions were barely astir when a hallooing voice in the rear made\nitself heard, and a horseman, breathless with haste, his steed flecked\nwith foam, rode up, indignant, flushed, and eager.\n\n\"Whyn't ye wait for me, Sher'ff? Ye air all on the wrong track,\" he\ncried. \"Boyston McGurny be hid in the skellington's tree. I glimpsed him\nthar myself, an' gin information.\"\n\nThe sheriff gazed down with averse and suspicious eyes. \"What's all\nthis!\" he said sternly. \"Give an account of yourself.\"\n\n\"Me!\" exclaimed the man in amazement. \"Why, I'm Barton Smith, yer guide,\nthat's who. An' I'm good for five hundred dollars' reward.\"\n\nBut the sheriff called off the pursuit for the time, as he had no means\nof replacing the bridge or of crossing the chasm.\n\nMeddlesome's share in the escape was not detected, and for a while she\nhad no incentive to the foolhardiness of boasting. But her prudence\ndiminished when the reward for the apprehension of Boyston McGurny was\nsuddenly withdrawn. The confession of one of the distillers, dying of\ntuberculosis contracted in prison, who had himself fired the fatal shot,\nhad established the alibi that McGurny claimed, and served to relieve\nhim of all suspicion.\n\nHe eventually became a \"herder\" of cattle on the bald of the mountain\nand a farmer in a small way, and in these placid pursuits he found a\ncontented existence. But, occasionally, a crony of his olden time would\ncontrast the profits of this tame industry at a disadvantage with the\nquick and large returns of the \"wild cat,\" when he would \"confess and\navoid.\"\n\n\"That's true, that's all true; but a man can't holp it no ways in the\nworld whenst he hev got a wife that is so out-an'-out meddlesome that\nshe won't let him run ag'in' the law, nohow he kin fix it.\"",
