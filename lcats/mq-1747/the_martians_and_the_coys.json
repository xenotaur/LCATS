    "body": "Maw Coy climbed the fence down at the end of the south pasture and\nstarted up the side of the creek, carrying her bundle over her shoulder\nand puffing slightly at her exertion.\n\nShe forded the creek there at the place where Hank's old coon dog\nJigger was killed by the boar three years ago come next hunting season.\nJumping from rock to rock across the creek made her puff even harder;\nMaw Coy wasn't as young as she once was.\n\nOn the other side she rested a minute to light up her pipe and to look\ncarefully about before heading up the draw. She didn't really expect\nto see any Martins around here, but you never knew. Besides, there\nmight've been a revenue agent. They were getting mighty thick and\nmighty uppity these days. You'd think the government'd have more to do\nthan bother honest folks trying to make an honest living.\n\nThe pipe lit, Maw swung the bundle back over her shoulder and started\nup the draw. Paw and the boys, she reckoned were probably hungry as a\npassel of hound dogs by now. She'd have to hurry.\n\nWhen she entered the far side of the clearing, she couldn't see any\nsigns of them so she yelled, \"You Paw! You Hank and Zeke!\" Maw Coy\nliked to give the men folks warning before she came up on the still.\nHank, in particular, was mighty quick on the trigger sometimes.\n\nBut there wasn't any answer. She trudged across the clearing to where\nthe still was hidden in a cluster of pines. Nobody was there but Lem.\n\nShe let the bundle down and glowered at him. \"Lem, you no-account, why\ndidn't you answer me when I hollered?\"\n\nHe grinned at her vacuously, not bothering to get up from where he sat\nwhittling, his back to an old oak. \"Huh?\" he said. A thin trickle of\nbrown ran down from the side of his mouth and through the stubble on\nhis chin.\n\n\"I said, how come you didn't answer when I hollered?\"\n\nHe said, \"You called Paw and Hank and Zeke, you didn't holler for me.\nWhat you got there, Maw, huh?\" His watery eyes were fixed on the bundle.\n\n\n\nMaw Coy sighed deeply and sat down on a tree stump. \"Now what you think\nI got there, Lem? I been a bringing your vittles to you every day since\nPaw and you boys started up this new still. Where's Paw and Zeke and\nHank?\"\n\nLem scratched himself with the stick he'd been whittling on. \"They\nwent off scoutin' around for the revenooers or maybe the Martins.\" He\nlet his mouth fall open and peered wistfully into the woods. He added,\n\"I wish I could shoot me a Martin, Maw. I wish I could. I sure wish I\ncould shoot me a Martin.\"\n\nThe idea excited him. He brought his hulking body to its feet and went\nover to pick up an ancient shotgun from where it leaned against a mash\nbarrel.\n\nMaw Coy was taking corn pone, some cold fried salt pork, and a quart of\nblack-strap molasses from her bundle and arranging it on the top of an\nempty keg. \"You mind yourself with that gun now, Lem. Mind how you shot\nup your foot that time.\"\n\nLem didn't hear her, he was stroking the stock of the shotgun\nabsently. \"I could do it easy,\" he muttered. \"I could shoot me a Martin\neasy. I sure could Maw. I'd show Hank and Zeke, I would.\"\n\n\"You forget about the Martins, son,\" Maw Coy said softly. \"Yore my\nsimple son--there's at least one in every family, mostly more--and\nit ain't fittin' that you get into fights. You got a strong back,\nstrongest in the hills, but yore too simple, Lem.\"\n\n\"I ain't as simple as Jim Martin, Maw,\" Lem protested.\n\n\"Son, they don't come no more simple than you,\" his mother told him\ngently. \"And mind that gun. You know how you bent the barrel of Zeke's\nWinchester back double that time, absent-minded like.\"\n\nHe stroked the gun stock, patted it, half in anger, half in protest.\nHis lower lip hung down in a pout. \"You stop talkin' thataway, Maw,\" he\ngrowled, \"or I'll larrup you one.\"\n\nMaw Coy didn't answer. She reckoned she'd better set off into the woods\nand see if she could locate the rest of the men folks, so they could\neat.\n\nLem said under his breath, \"I could shoot me a Martin real easy, I\ncould.\"\n\n\n\n_To the Most High, the Glorious, the Omnipotent, Omnipresent, and\nOmniscient, the Lord of the Seven, the Leader of the Chosen, Neo Geek\nXXXVIII:_\n\nIn regard to: _Testing of special weapons designed to eliminate present\npopulation of the third planet with the eventual view of colonizing._\n\nFrom: _Seegeel Wan, Commander of Spacecruiser 12B44._\n\n_Your Omnipotence_:\n\nUpon the receipt of your orders, we proceeded to the planet in question\n(known to its inhabitants as Earth, or Terra) first touching at its\nsatellite (Luna) in order to pick up the observation group which has\nbeen studying the potential foe for several decals.\n\nCommander of the observation group, Baren Darl, has enjoyed the\nreputation of being our most outstanding authority on Earthlings. It\nhas been principally through his recommendations that the secret,\nsupplementary weapons, worked upon for the past decal, were devised.\nBaren Darl has successfully deciphered the principal language of\nEarth and though listening to their radio emanations has compiled a\nformidable work on his findings. But of his abilities, more later.\n\nIt might be added here that Baren Darl and all his group were more than\nready to proceed to Earth and begin the slaughter of its inhabitants.\nIt seems that these investigators have for decals listened most\ncarefully to every radio emanation possible to pick up. This has\nevidently led them to the edge of complete frenzy--especially those\nwho have been assigned the morning programs, sometimes known as \"soap\noperas\" by the Earthlings.\n\nBaren Darl inspected the newly created weapons with considerable care\nand proclaimed them excellent for our purposes. In particular he was\nimpressed with the I.Q. Depressor; the deadly poison, _nark_; and the\nlepbonic plague carrying fleas. He was convinced that these secret\nweapons would give our forces that advantage we seek before launching\nour all out attack upon Earth.\n\nActing on Darl's suggestions, we avoided the more heavily populated\nareas of Earth and landed our Spacecruiser in a mountainous area of\nthe planet known as Kentucky, a sub-division of the United States of\nAmerica, one of the more advanced Earth nations.\n\nOur plans did not work out exactly as expected.\n\n\n\nKeeping well in mind the need for secrecy, we made every attempt to\nland the Spacecruiser without detection. We settled in a small valley\nnear a stream and immediately sent out scouts to determine if there was\nany sign that our craft had been sighted in descent.\n\nEvidently, the population of the vicinity was so small that our\nplans were successful. Our patrols reported only one small group of\nEarthlings in the immediate area.\n\nDeciding to test the new weapons on this gathering, we disembarked a\nforce of a dozen warriors, all disguised as Earthlings and with myself\nas commander and Baren Darl as our technical advisor.\n\n\"We must keep our senses alert for Sam Spade, Superman and the Lone\nRanger,\" Baren Darl said nervously, peering around among the strange\nexotic trees and other vegetation that grows on Earth.\n\nI was somewhat surprised at his tone and obvious unease.\n\n\"Who?\" I asked. \"What?\"\n\n\"Three Terran warriors of amazing ability and viciousness,\" he told me.\n\"I have been gathering reports of their activities from the radio for\nsome time. They seem to have clairvoyant minds; one or the other of\nthem almost invariably appears on the scene of violence.\"\n\nI said impatiently, \"Without doubt, our weapons would mean the end of\nthese warriors.\"\n\nI did not share his belief that any Earthling warriors might be our\nequals or superiors, but to remain on the cautious side, I immediately\nordered that the Elect-no be switched on. This weapon, one of the\nseveral designed for the Earth campaign, as your Omnipotence is\nundoubtedly aware, is so constructed as to prevent the use of any\ninternal combustion engine within a dozen miles of the Elect-no. In\nthis case, no aircraft, nor landcraft, utilizing internal combustion,\ncould enter our zone.\n\nBaren Darl seemed somewhat relieved at this precaution, but his\nattitude to a certain extent began to affect the rest of us. To\nprepare for any eventuality, I had the Fission-Suppressor activated.\nThis, of course, automatically made it impossible for nuclear fission\nto take place within a hundred miles of our ship.\n\n\n\nThat measure pleased Baren Darl exceedingly in view of the fact that\nthe Earth nations seemed to be spending practically all of their\nmilitary appropriations on their so-called A-Bombs and H-Bombs.\nAccording to the radio emanations our Luna base had picked up, the\nEarthlings were interested in little else in a military way, except\npossibly bacteriological weapons, and, of course, we were prepared\nto deal them a strong blow along that line with our lepbonic plague\nspreading fleas.\n\nAt any rate, knowing that we had suppressed the use of their major\nweapon, the fission bomb, and had prevented transportation from\nentering the vicinity, we proceeded toward the clearing where the\nEarthlings had gathered, determined to test the I.Q. Depressor, _nark_,\nand the lepbonic plague fleas, for it was upon the success of these\nweapons that our Earth campaign depended.\n\nWe proceeded with care toward the clearing on the edge of which our\nscouts had detected the Earthlings, and carefully approached from\nbehind the one specimen we saw there. Evidently, the others had gone\noff.\n\nBaren Darl, the only member of our little group who was familiar with\nthe language, acted as spokesman, and we concealed for the moment at\nleast, the purpose of our \"visit.\" The following conversation was\nrecorded by Baren Darl himself and later translated as literally as\npossible into our own superior language.\n\nEarthling: \"Huh? What's that?\"\n\nBaren Darl: \"Have no fear.\"\n\nEarthling: \"Revenooers! Paw! Hank!\"\n\n(The meaning of the word _revenooers_ was completely unknown to Baren\nDarl but from the Earthling's tone of voice it is to be assumed that\nthe term is a derogatory one.)\n\nBaren Darl: \"We are not revenooers. We are friends.\"\n\nEarthling: \"Huh?\"\n\nBaren Darl: \"We are not revenooers. We are friends.\"\n\nEarthling (suspiciously): \"Well, you can't have no free corn, if that's\nwhat you're looking for. Can't buy none neither. Paw won't sell no raw\ncorn. Says corn ain't fitten to drink unless it's been aged a week.\"\n\n(This conversation seemed to puzzle Baren Darl and I was beginning to\nsuspect already that his knowledge of the Earthlings was somewhat less\nthan he had led me to believe.)\n\nBaren Darl: \"Where are the others?\"\n\nEarthling: \"Huh?\"\n\n(This continual inability on the Earthling's part to understand the\nquestions put to him by Baren Darl also caused me to wonder whether or\nnot the decals spent on Luna in observing Earth were quite as fruitful\nas they might have been.)\n\nBaren Darl: \"Where are the others?\"\n\nEarthling: \"Oh, you mean Maw and Paw and Hank and Zeke. They're off\nlooking for Martins.\"\n\n(Your Omnipotence is of course aware that in the language of the\nEarthlings our glorious planet is known as _Mars_, and we as\n_Martians_, or, evidently, as this Earthling pronounced it, _Martins_.)\n\n\n\nThis information was, as you can well imagine, startling, since we had\nsupposed that our landing had been made in the most complete secrecy.\nWhat means they had utilized to discover us is unknown.\n\nBaren Darl: \"Ahhhhh. And, er ... what made them suspect there were\nMartians in the vicinity?\"\n\nEarthling: \"Huh?\"\n\nBaren Darl: \"What made Maw and Paw and Hank and Zeke think there were\nMartians around?\"\n\nEarthling: \"Oh.\"\n\nBaren Darl: \"What made them think there were Martians about?\"\n\nEarthling: \"Paw says he can smell him a Martin from most twenty miles\naway. Paw's got a regular feelin' for Martins, like. Paw'd rather shoot\nhim a Martin than eat fried chicken. I wish I could shoot me a Martin,\nI wish. Yup, I sure wish I could shoot me a Martin. I wish--\"\n\n(This sixth sense of some of the Earthlings had been unsuspected by\nBaren Darl in spite of his decals of investigation. Evidently, the\nEarthlings have an unusual ability to detect the presence of alien life\nforms. Also surprising was the fact that the Earthlings were evidently\naware of our plans to conquer their planet and were already worked up\nto a pitch of patriotism which made them extremely anxious to destroy\nus.)\n\nBaren Darl turned to me and explained that there were four more of the\nEarthlings in the woods searching for us and that undoubtedly they\nwould soon return. He suggested that we immediately try some of our\nweapons upon this specimen.\n\nThe plan seemed feasible enough so I ordered one of the warriors to\nfind a suitable liquid in which to place a portion of the poison _nark_.\n\nUltimate plans, as you are aware, had been to drop, by spacecraft,\nsmall containers of _nark_ in the reservoirs, rivers and lakes of the\nEarthlings. One drop was designated to be, as your Omnipotence knows,\nsufficient to poison a reservoir capable of supplying the water needs\nof a hundred thousand Earthlings.\n\nAlthough water was not available, the warrior was soon able to find\nwhat was obviously a container for some type of beverage. It was\nnearly full of a colorless fluid.\n\nThe following conversation then took place between Baren Darl and the\nEarthling:\n\nBaren Darl: \"What is this?\"\n\nEarthling: \"Huh? Oh, that's _white mule_. Yup, sure is.\"\n\nBaren Darl (puzzled): \"I thought a mule was a four legged animal of\nburden particularly noted for kicking.\"\n\nEarthling (vaguely): \"Paw's white mule's got lots of kick in it. Yup.\"\n\n\n\nUpon finding it was a beverage, as we had suspected, a small quantity\nof _nark_ was quickly inserted.\n\nBaren Darl: \"Try a drink.\"\n\nEarthling: \"What say?\"\n\nBaren Darl: \"Have a drink?\"\n\nEarthling: \"Uhhhhh. Maybe I will, but don't tell Paw. Paw says I'm\nsimple enough without no white mule.\"\n\n(Here he took a long draught without seeming effect, although we were\nexpecting him to fall dead at our feet. We stood there staring at him,\nunbelievingly.)\n\nEarthling: \"That tasted mighty good. Got more of a kick than usual.\nYup, sure did. Tasted like maybe somebody put in a wallop of\nturpentine.\"\n\nHe seemed perfectly at ease. I turned to Baren Darl and snapped, \"The\ntype of poison you recommended seems less than effective.\"\n\nBaren Darl was obviously shocked. \"It is inconceivable,\" he said.\n\"Possibly the fluid in which we dissolved the _nark_ acted as an\nantidote.\"\n\nI turned my back on him angrily. \"I begin to wonder about the effect of\nyour other weapons!\"\n\nHe waved to one of the warriors who had been burdened with the I.Q.\nDepressor. \"We'll try this immediately,\" he said, anxiety in his tone.\n\nWhile the machine was being readied, Baren Darl explained its workings\nto me in some detail. Meanwhile, the Earthling continued to sip at\nthe jug which supposedly contained sufficient poison to eliminate an\naverage large Terran city.\n\n\"As you know,\" Baren Darl told me, \"the mind, whether of Earthlings or\nMartian type, is capable of being either stimulated or depressed. For\nhundreds of decals our race has possessed chemicals capable of such\ndepression or stimulation. However, to my knowledge, this device is the\nonly one yet developed which can suppress the intelligence quotient of\nanyone within an area of many square miles.\n\n\"The plan for utilizing it is a simple but effective one. When we\nconfront a body of Earthling soldiery, our men need only to turn on the\nI.Q. Depressor to turn the enemy into brainless idiots. Their defeat\nwould then obviously be quite simple.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" I told him stiffly, \"let us proceed to try it on this\nEarthling.\"\n\n\n\nThe device seemed quite elementary in construction. Baren Darl\nactivated it by the simple flicking of a switch. We ourselves, of\ncourse, were immune to its workings since it was tuned only to the\nEarth type brain.\n\n\"It is now in operation?\" I asked Baren Darl.\n\n\"Definitely. Watch the Earthling.\"\n\n\"I am watching.\"\n\nThe supposed top authority on Earth and Earthlings approached the\nspecimen and eyed him carefully. The following conversation ensued:\n\nBaren Darl: \"How do you feel?\"\n\nEarthling: \"Huh?\"\n\n(Baren Darl seemed pleased at this response, and, indeed, it would seem\nthat the subject was on the verge of idiocy.)\n\nBaren Darl: \"How do you feel?\"\n\nEarthling: \"I guess I feel fine. Yup, yup. Feel fine.--How'd you feel,\nstranger?\"\n\nBaren Darl (scowling): \"Does your head feel somewhat different? Does\nyour mind seem more sluggish?\"\n\nEarthling: \"Huh?\"\n\nBaren Darl: \"Does your thinking seem weaker?\"\n\nEarthling: \"Nope. Can't say it does, stranger. Fact is, it'd be purdy\nhard to make my thinking much weaker. Yup, sure would.\"\n\nBaren Darl stared at him for a long period, unbelievingly. Obviously,\nthe I.Q. Depressor had been worthless as far as undermining the\nearthling's intelligence is concerned.\n\nFinally this alleged authority on Earthlings and upon Earth affairs\nflashed a look of despair at me, and at the others of us who stood\naround him.\n\n\"The fleas,\" he blurted finally, \"the lepbonic plague fleas. This\nweapon alone might well destroy the whole population of earth. Bring\nthe fleas.\"\n\nI said coldly, \"We shall see, Baren Darl.\" Then to one of the warriors,\n\"Bring the fleas that carry this so _deadly_--so Baren Darl tells\nus--lepbonic plague.\"\n\n\n\nThe Earthling was ignoring us now and had gone back to taking an\noccasional drink from his jug. Our warrior approached carefully from\nbehind him and dropped a half dozen of the supposedly deadly insects\nupon the Earthling's back.\n\nWe then stood back and watched cautiously. According to Baren Darl, the\nfast spreading disease should take effect almost immediately.\n\nThe Earthling sat there, the I.Q. Depressor still tuned on but\nobviously unable to lower his intelligence an iota. He continued to\nsip from the jug of white mule, which had enough _nark_ in it to kill\nthousands. Occasionally, he scratched himself.\n\n\"I guess I'll take me a nap,\" he said thickly, his words slurred. He\nscratched himself once again, yawned deeply, and slumped against the\ntree, obviously in sleep.\n\nBaren Darl looked at me triumphantly. \"The reaction is somewhat\ndifferent than we'd expected, but obviously the fleas have given him\nlepbonic plague. This weapon at least is as successful as we had--\"\n\nI peered down at the Earthling suspiciously. His clothes were\ndisarrayed and torn. I pointed at a speck on his uncouthly hairy chest.\n\n\"And what is that?\" I snapped at Baren Darl.\n\nHe bent down to see what I indicated.\n\n\"It seems to be one of the fleas,\" he told me.\n\n\"Then what is it doing on its back with its feet up in the air?\"\n\n\"It seems indisposed.\"\n\n\"It seems _dead_ you numbskull!\" I roared at him. \"After biting this\nEarthling your fleas have died!\"\n\nIn a high rage, I strode up and down the clearing trying to coordinate\nmy thoughts to the point where I could make an intelligent decision on\nthis situation. Obviously, a crisis was at hand. Using these weapons\ndevised by our scientists, after detailed instructions on their\nconstruction by Baren Darl and his group of efficient \"experts,\" would\nobviously be suicidal. They were completely worthless.\n\nI came to a snap conclusion. Our plan must be to reveal ourselves to\nthe Earthlings as Martians and pretend to come bearing them only good\nwill and desire for peace and commerce. A few months on their planet,\nclosely--but unbeknown to them--studying their life form, should give\nus ample opportunity to plan more effective weapons against them.\n\nThis then was my decision.\n\nI snapped to Baren Darl. \"Awaken the Earthman; tell him that we are\nMartians and that we seek peace with the inhabitants of Earth.\"\n\n\n\nThere was some difficulty in the awakening, but finally Baren Darl\nsucceeded. The Earthling shook his head groggily and scowled at my\ninterpreter. The following conversation ensued:\n\nBaren Darl: \"Awaken. We have a message of great importance for you.\"\n\nEarthling: \"Huh?\"\n\nBaren Darl: \"We have a message for you.\"\n\nEarthling (Rolling over on his other side): \"Oh.\"\n\nBaren Darl said impressively: \"In the name of the Most High, the\nGlorious, the Omnipotent, Omnipresent, and Omniscient, the Lord of\nthe Seven, the Leader of the Chosen, Neo Geek XXXVIII; we bring you\ngreetings from the Martians.\"\n\nEarthling: \"Huh?\"\n\nBaren Darl: \"We Martians offer you the friendship and the good will of\na people that--\"\n\nEarthling: \"Martins! Are you'uns Martins?\"\n\nBaren Darl: \"That is correct. We Martians come with the greetings and--\"\n\nAt this point, your Omnipotence, my account must of necessity be\nsomewhat vague, for even after we had made good our escape back to the\nspacecruiser, bearing our more serious casualties with us, we were\nunable to agree among ourselves on just what had happened.\n\nBaren Darl, who is now under arrest and in the darkest recess of the\nSpacecruiser 12B44 laden down with chains, is of the opinion that the\nEarthling was none other than either Superman or the Lone Ranger in\ndisguise. He contends that both of these earthling warriors are prone\nto adopt disguises in this manner, revealing themselves only at the\nlast moment to their enemies.\n\nSuffice to say, however, that we were all successful in making good our\nretreat to the spacecruiser although all of our equipment and supplies\nwere destroyed in the melee. Upon regaining the spacecraft we blasted\noff hurriedly, to return to our own sacred planet.\n\nI recommend, your Omnipotence, that the plans to subjugate the planet\nEarth be indefinitely postponed in view of the fact that our specially\ndesigned weapons proved worthless and in particular view of the\nabilities of Earthling warriors.\n\nI further recommend that the unspeakable Baren Darl, who obviously\nfrittered away his time during the decals spent on Luna supposedly\nstudying the Earthlings, be sent to the Nairebis Salt Mines.\n\n                                                            Obediently,\n                                                            Seegeel Wan\n                                                              Commander\n                                                    Spacecruiser 12B44.\n\n\n\nMaw and Paw Coy and Hank and Zeke came back into the clearing wearily.\nThe boys had done a lot of tramping and were hungry for their vittles,\nand Maw was feeling bodacious about their taking off to go hunting for\nMartins. Paw had told her to shut up two or three times but it hadn't\nbeen much use.\n\nLem was sitting on an upended mash barrel loading his old shotgun and\ngrinning vacuously. He seemed unaware of the fact that the stock of the\ngun was a splintered ruin.\n\n\"Guess what, Paw,\" he yelled. \"I got me a Martin. I got me a whole\npassel of Martins, Paw, I sure did. Yup, I--\"\n\nPaw Coy grunted, and started poking around in the vittles Maw had\nbrought up from the cabin.\n\nThe boys leaned their rifles up against the oak and each picked up a\nhandy fruit jar of corn squeezins.\n\nHank said nastily, \"Sure you got a whole passel of Martins, Lem. In\nyore sleep, you got a passel of Martins.\"\n\nLem said belligerently, \"Don't you go a talkin' thataway Hank, or\nI'll ... I'll throw you up into the tree the way I did that time you\nhit me with the ax. I did so get me some Martins. I was a sittin' here\nwhen a whole passel come outen the woods. Didn't know they was Martins\nat first. Then--\"\n\nMaw Coy handed him a chunk of corn pone. \"Now you be quiet, Lem, and\neat your vittles. Sure you got yourself a Martin, Lem.\"\n\nA thin trickle of brown ran down from the side of Lem's mouth. He spit\non the ground before him, with an air of happy belligerence.\n\n\"I sure did, Maw. I sure got me a passel of Martins. Yup, I sure did.\"",
