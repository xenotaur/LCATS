She looked about her with bright,\nalert eyes, hoping no one had been a witness to her desertion, and then\ncarefully began to climb down. She need not have alarmed herself, for\nshe was no bigger than a minute, and clearer eyes than those of the\nrheumatic old antiquarian who kept the shop would have been needed to\ncomprehend her departure. Fortunately, the shelf onto which she had\nemerged was not high, and by exercising great caution the little girl\nwas able to reach the floor without mishap.\n\nStill watching the old man closely, she reached a hand into the pocket\nof her print dress and produced a few crumbs of cake, which she\nimmediately ate. Almost instantly she began to grow, and, in a moment,\nfrom a tiny little mite of three or four inches, she had shot up into\nas tall a schoolgirl of thirteen as the proudest parent could wish. The\nascent, indeed, was so rapid that before she quite realized what had\nhappened, there was her head on a level with the shelf upon which, only\nan instant before, she had been standing; and there was the prison\nfrom which she had escaped. \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland,\u201d read\nthe gold letters over the door.\n\nShe plucked the volume from its place, and advanced with it toward the\nguardian of the bookshop.\n\n\u201cIf it is not too high,\u201d said Alice, \u201cI think I shall take this.\u201d\n\nThe old bookseller, whose wits had been woolgathering for many years,\nwould not have admitted for worlds that he had not heard her enter the\nshop. He took the book from her hand.\n\n\u201cYou choose wisely,\u201d he said, and patted the red covers lovingly.\n\u201cAlice\u2015\u2015the ageless child! It is one of the greatest compendiums of\nwit and sense in literature. There are only two books to match it. You\nshall have it for fifteen cents, for it is far from new, and I see what\nI had not noticed before, that the frontispiece is missing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what are the other two?\u201d asked Alice, eagerly.\n\n\u201cWhen you are older you will read them,\u201d said the old bookman. \u201cThey\nare called \u2018Don Quixote\u2019 and \u2018The Pickwick Papers\u2019.\u201d\n\nThen very suddenly Alice blushed, for she remembered that she could not\npay. Timidly, she handed back the red-covered volume.\n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I have no money. I don\u2019t know why I was so\nstupid as to come away without any.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoney!\u201d cried the antiquarian. \u201cDid I ask you money for this book?\nForgive me! It is a habit I have fallen into for which I am very\nsorry. Money is the least important thing in the world. Only the\nworthless things are to be had for money. Those things which are beyond\nprice\u2015\u2015thank God!\u2015\u2015are to be had for the asking. Take it, child!\nTomorrow is Christmas day. I should be grieved indeed if there were no\n_Alice_ for you on Christmas day\u2015\u2015as grieved as if there were no Santa\nClaus.\u201d\n\nThere was something so unearthly about this strange old man that Alice\nwondered if she were not yet in Wonderland. With a sobriety quite out\nof keeping with her usually merry disposition, she thanked him and went\nforth into the snow-clad streets.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe plethora of Santa Clauses spending the holiday week-end in the city\nbewildered Alice, and now, after a long afternoon in the hurly-burly\nof metropolitan life, she was becoming tired. The number of Santa\nClauses resident upon earth appalled her, and the extravagance of their\npromises, while pleasant enough, almost frightened her. Without any\nquestions asked\u2015\u2015even her address, which, had it been requested, would\nhave taxed her wits rather severely\u2015\u2015they accepted her commissions and\nguaranteed immediate delivery. The final excursion through the great\ndepartment stores had been adventurous and diverting, but now\u2015\u2015toward\nnightfall\u2015\u2015was becoming monotonous, what with its profusion of Kris\nKringles and street hawkers, and its babble of eleventh hour shoppers.\nIt was like witnessing a really thrilling movie drama for the second\ntime, thought Alice, who had initiated herself into the delights of\nmoving-picture entertainment for the first time that day, and wondered\nat its remarkable duplication. By five o\u2019clock the little girl knew\njust what each and every Santa Claus was going to say to her, and what\nwas coming next, and that one\u2015\u2015at least\u2015\u2015of the three remaining Santas\nwould want to kiss her. She had been kissed almost to death, as it was,\nand that was beginning to bore her, too.\n\nIt occurred to Alice, who was a shrewd little girl and not one of your\nbleating lambs, that Santa Claus, despite his profusion\u2015\u2015or because of\nit\u2015\u2015might be something of an old fraud, after all. She was entirely\ncertain that not one of him resembled the jolly old saint of her mental\npicture. The cottony fellow at Wanacooper\u2019s was not a bit red and\nchubby, nor very jovial either; and she hoped that the others\u2015\u2015at the\nEmporium, and the Bargain Store, and the Bon March\u00e9\u2015\u2015would agree more\nsympathetically, as to corpulence, with the merry and very dear old\ngentleman of her favorite poem.\n\nShe repeated the first lines, softly, under her breath:\n\n    _\u2019Twas the night before Christmas,\n      And all through the house\n    Not a creature was stirring,\n      Not even a mouse...._\n\nWell, that was not not surprising. Obviously, all the creatures who\nmight otherwise have been stirring about the house on the night before\nChristmas were crowding and jostling each other in department stores,\nbuying useless presents for people they didn\u2019t like. Alice thought it\nodd that this hadn\u2019t occurred to her before. It made the beginning of\nthe poem quite clear.\n\nThe Santa Claus at the Emporium was entirely surrounded by children.\nEntirely surrounded? Why not? The schoolroom definition of an island\nis authority for it: \u201cAn island is a body of land entirely surrounded\nby water.\u201d Sticklers for accuracy will have it that the \u201centirely\u201d is\nextraneous. If, they say, if he\u2015\u2015or it\u2015\u2015that is, Santa Claus or the\nisland\u2015\u2015is surrounded by anything (whether water or children), he\u2015\u2015or\nit\u2015\u2015is surrounded, and that is all there is to it. Not \u201centirely\nsurrounded\u201d; just surrounded. Happily, Alice knew nothing of this.\nAs for us, we are nothing if not independent, and care nothing for\ngrammarians\u2015\u2015nothing at all. The Santa Claus at the Emporium was\nentirely surrounded by children, just like all his duplicates, and, in\nthe midst of an alarming racket, was writing long lists of juvenile\nwants in a big bookkeeper\u2019s ledger. The big bookkeeper was nowhere\nabout, and so the old fellow went right ahead, just as if it had been\nhis own ledger, and filled as many columns as a child wished, in the\nmost amiable manner in the world. He was the nicest Santa Claus Alice\nhad yet seen.\n\nHe did not immediately notice Alice, who was neither larger nor smaller\nthan most of the other children shouting around him; but when he did\nnotice her he liked her right away. He liked the old-fashioned way of\nher, and her last century clothes, and from the way she looked at him\nhe was sure that _she_, at least, believed in him, and wasn\u2019t dropping\nin just to see how much she could get out of him. And then he hurried,\nso that he could finish quickly with the others and get around to\nAlice. It wasn\u2019t very long until there she was\u2015\u2015right up beside him,\nwith his dear old whiskers tickling her shell-like ears (one of them,\nanyway), and his pen poised over a perfectly blank page, ready to write\ndown anything that Alice asked him to. And his voice, too, was very\npleasant.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d said this kindly old saint, adjusting his eyebrows with some\ncare, for they were slightly moth-eaten and appeared to be falling\noff\u2015\u2015and no wonder, either, for some hundreds of boys and girls had\nbeen leaning against them all day\u2015\u2015\u201cNow,\u201d said this nice old man, \u201cwhat\ndo you wish me to bring _you_ for Christmas, little Golden-hair?\u201d\n\nThere was something charming about the way he emphasized the _you_ that\nput Alice at ease immediately. So she told him all about the lovely\ndoll, and the darling kitten, and the sweet bird she wanted, and had\nbeen wanting for a long time, and all about the books she needed with\nwhich to catch up on the world. For she had been locked away for so\nlong that she felt a bit out of date, and such phrases as \u201cLeague of\nNations\u201d and \u201cMaple Nut Sundae\u201d simply meant nothing to her, while they\nwere the common property of every other girl and boy in the land.\n\nThe good-natured old soul wrote them all down very carefully, and then\nkissed Alice just as she had expected he would. He promised faithfully\nto deliver every one of her orders, in person, and warned her about\nseeing that the hearth fire was extinguished before midnight.\n\n\u201cBecause promptly at midnight,\u201d he said, \u201cI shall come down the\nchimley.\u201d\n\nAlice giggled at that.\n\n\u201cYou mean the chimney, don\u2019t you?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cChimney, indeed!\u201d snorted Santa Claus. \u201cAfter all these years, don\u2019t\nyou think I know the difference between a chimney and a chimley? No,\nsir! I come down a chimley, every time. I\u2019ll leave it to everyone here.\u201d\n\nAnd turning to the crowd of boys and girls around him, he asked: \u201cHow\ndo I get into the house, children?\u201d\n\n\u201cDown the chimley!\u201d roared the chorus.\n\n\u201cYou see?\u201d said Santa Claus.\n\nAlice did see, and felt very much ashamed of her display of ignorance.\n\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d said Santa Claus, kindly. \u201cBut I think,\u201d he added, \u201cyou\nhad better go with my assistant, and be quite sure we have all these\nthings in stock. He\u2019ll be glad to show you around. It\u2019s all free, you\nknow. Just look around as long as you like, and if you see anything\nelse you want, come right back and tell me about it.\u201d\n\nThere was a little boy standing beside Santa Claus, with a metal tag\non his collar, and the generous old gentleman turned to him and told\nhim to go and fetch his\u2015\u2015that is, Santa Claus\u2019s\u2015\u2015assistant. While Alice\nwas waiting, a lot of other children pushed forward, and Alice was\npretty nearly forgotten. But after a while she heard some one say,\n\u201cHe\u2019s coming now. He\u2019ll be here in just a minute, now,\u201d and at the same\nmoment she saw Santa Claus\u2019s assistant coming toward her.\n\nHe was a sprightly little fellow, and Alice decided to like him. He\ncame up in a sort of blue-green light, which danced all around him, and\nwithout the slightest hesitation Alice took his hand and walked away\nwith him.\n\nThe little man\u2019s fingers were so cold and hard, though, that Alice was\nsurprised, and when she was sure he wasn\u2019t looking she looked him over\nearnestly. After she had done that, she almost screamed, used as she\nwas to odd things in Wonderland. For the little man was made of wood.\nEverything was wood, and Alice was holding on to his wooden fingers,\nand he was talking out of his wooden mouth, and the whole affair was\nthe most wooden episode Alice could remember. His remarks concerning\nsome of the books Alice wanted, the little girl thought, were the most\nwooden thing about him. But the little man\u2019s face was rather nice, for\nit was highly painted in blue and green, and he had bright yellow eyes\nthat fairly sparkled with enamel.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d said the wooden man. \u201cDolls were first on the list,\nweren\u2019t they? Well, here we are. We call this room \u2018The Kingdom of\nDolls,\u2019 although as a matter of fact it is ruled by a Queen, and never\ndid have a King, because the Queen is rather old and nobody will marry\nher. And as she won\u2019t allow any of the other dolls to marry until she\nherself finds a King, it makes it hard for the younger ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cDear me,\u201d said Alice. \u201cDo you suppose I might get a peep at the Queen,\nwithout being seen?\u201d\n\n\u201cEasy enough,\u201d said the wooden man, \u201cfor there she is\u2015\u2015that long-haired\ndoll with the purple robe. She likes to be looked at, and I need hardly\nremark that her hair is false. She\u2019s awfully stuck up, though, and we\nwon\u2019t tarry long, for she\u2019d only snub us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a funny crown she is wearing,\u201d laughed Alice, turning her head to\nlook back.\n\n\u201cYou may well say so,\u201d said the wooden man, ironically, \u201cfor it is made\nof kistletoe. She never takes it off!\u201d\n\n\u201cKistletoe!\u201d said Alice, and then, forgetting her humiliating experience\nabout the chimley, \u201cDon\u2019t you mean mistletoe?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I mean kistletoe,\u201d replied the wooden man, rather impatiently.\n\u201cEverybody knows what kistletoe is. But then, perhaps you are too\nyoung. When you are older you will know more.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thirteen,\u201d said Alice, with proper dignity.\n\n\u201cThirteen!\u201d shrieked the wooden man, so loudly that Alice felt sure\nshe had offended again. \u201cWhat a dreadfully unlucky number! I should be\nfrightened to death to be thirteen. How long have you been thirteen?\u201d\n\n\u201cNearly two months now,\u201d Alice confessed, miserably. Then she\nbrightened. \u201cBut everybody has to be thirteen sometime. Weren\u2019t you\never thirteen?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever!\u201d declared the wooden man, firmly. \u201cWhen my thirteenth birthday\napproached, I tore off an entire year of the calendar, and passed\nright into my fourteenth year. Of course, there was a fearful row\nabout it! But it\u2019s really just like skipping a grade at school. If\nyou\u2019re smart enough you can do it. We have some very nice calendars,\u201d\nhe added, professionally.\n\nAlice was frankly bewildered, but she had forgotten her wounded\ndignity. In a moment her attention was attracted by a succession of\nmelodious sounds, ending on a queer upward inflection that seemed to\nleave the phrase unfinished, and hanging in the air.\n\n\u201cDo listen!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cIsn\u2019t that too sweet? It sounds like a\nbird singing.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost birds do,\u201d said the wooden man, drily. \u201cThat\u2019s your bird,\u201d he\nadded, more politely. \u201cYou asked for a bird, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why does it end its song so abruptly?\u201d asked Alice. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t\nseem to finish.\u201d\n\n\u201cConfinement,\u201d answered the little guide, briefly. \u201cIts cage is too\nsmall. Its notes only reach the top of the cage, and then echo back\ninto its own ears, which naturally surprises it into silence. It\u2019s too\nbad, for it\u2019s losing its upper register. It once sang very well.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall let it go when I get it,\u201d declared Alice, with decision.\n\n\u201cYou may do as you please, of course,\u201d agreed the wooden man, \u201cbut\nyou\u2019ll only be wanting another one, next Christmas.\u201d\n\nThey hurried forward, pressing through the crowd about the cage. It\nwas humorous the way the people fell back on either side of the wooden\nman\u2019s sharp-elbows. What they saw, when they reached the cage, was a\nbeautiful yellow bird with black wings, and big black eyes, swinging\nand singing on a perch of gold.\n\n\u201cWound up too tightly,\u201d muttered the wooden man. \u201cOne of the monkeys\nhas been monkeying with the key.\u201d\n\nWith a ferocious glare at the children around him, he reached in a\nhand, and Alice heard a sharp click. The bird stopped singing in the\nmiddle of a note. Then the wooden man lifted the little creature from\nits perch and brought it forth with as little concern as if it were\nmade of wood, too.\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d cried Alice, in distress. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t hurt the bird! It wasn\u2019t\nits fault that somebody monkeyed with the key.\u201d\n\nThe word _monkeyed_ puzzled her, but she supposed it was all right,\nsince that was what the wooden man had said.\n\nBut the wooden man only laughed and held out the bird for her\ninspection. Then Alice saw that it was not a real bird at all, but was\nmade of thin metal so skilfully painted as to look real.\n\n\u201cYou forget this is Toyland,\u201d grinned the wooden man. \u201cThis bird is no\nmore real than I am, than these children are\u2015\u2015than you are!\u201d\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t I real?\u201d asked Alice, in alarm. Quickly correcting herself, she\nsaid: \u201cAm I not real?\u201d\n\n\u201cReal enough,\u201d said the wooden man, casually. \u201cA real nuisance,\u201d he\nmuttered, under his breath; but fortunately Alice did not hear this\nrude remark. He continued, more pleasantly: \u201cOh, the bird is real\nenough, too. But it\u2019s been wound up too tightly. It doesn\u2019t know what\nit is singing, or why it is singing. It lacks a soul.\u201d\n\nThis remark was too deep for Alice, so she made no reply. After a\nminute, she asked:\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t there any more animals?\u201d\n\n\u201cBirds aren\u2019t animals,\u201d sneered the wooden man, and then he was very\nmuch ashamed of himself. \u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d he said, contritely. \u201cI\nhad forgotten you are only thirteen.\u201d (He shuddered as he mentioned\nthe sinister number.) \u201cWell, yes, there is the Performing Pony, and\nthe Whistling Toad, and the Talking Dog, and the Teddy Bear, and the\nLaughing Hyena, and the Sorrowful Snake, and the Ingenious Ibex, and\nthe Loquacious Lynx, and\u2015\u2015Oh, we have quite a menagerie!\u201d\n\nHe looked quizzically at Alice, and suddenly began to sing:\n\n    _O, ferocious and atrocious is the beast they call the lynx;\n    And fierce his howl, and black his scowl, and red his jowl,\n        methinks...._\n\n\u201cYou have a very nice voice,\u201d said Alice, as the singer paused.\n\n\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t interrupt,\u201d snapped the wooden man. \u201cFirst you\nwant to hear about the animals, and then you don\u2019t.\u201d He stopped short.\n\u201cDo you really like my voice?\u201d he asked eagerly. Then his head drooped\nwoodenly, for he saw that Alice was no longer paying attention.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t much of a voice myself,\u201d mused the little girl, \u201cbut I think\nI could speak a piece.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hear it,\u201d urged the wooden man. And moment Alice heard herself\nreciting:\n\n    _I thought I heard a parson swear\n      Because his eyes were sore;\n    I turned around, and saw it was\n      The watchdog\u2019s honest snore.\n    \u201cAlas,\u201d he whispered, tearfully,\n      \u201cThat two times two is four!\u201d_\n\n    _I thought I saw a mastodon\n      Upon the pantry shelf;\n    I looked again, and saw it was\n      A picture of myself.\n    \u201cO dear,\u201d I said, \u201cthe albatross\n      Is eating all the pelf!\u201d_\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s pelf?\u201d demanded the wooden man, critically.\n\n\u201cPelf is\u2015\u2015I think it\u2019s something to eat,\u201d explained Alice. \u201cBut I\ndidn\u2019t have to say pelf, could have said elf, or delf\u2015\u2015\u201d\n\n\u201cOr skjelf!\u201d jeered the wooden man. \u201cPoetic license is a dangerous\nthing for a girl of thirteen. I shall see that yours is revoked at\nonce.\u201d\n\nAlice began to cry with shame and humiliation.\n\n\u201cThere, there,\u201d cried the wooden man, ashamed of himself again. \u201cI was\nonly plaguing you. You rhyme beautifully\u2015\u2015much better than I do. Now,\nlet\u2019s go and see P. D.\u201d\n\n\u201cP. D.?\u201d queried Alice, drying her tears. \u201cWho is P. D.?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy the Plausible Donkey, to be sure,\u201d laughed the wooden man. \u201cYou\nsaid you wanted to see some more animals.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you call him D. P.?\u201d asked Alice, after a moment, as they\nwalked toward the menagerie.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d The wooden man seemed suspicious.\n\n\u201cDemocratic Party,\u201d giggled Alice; and then stopped as she caught sight\nof the wooden man\u2019s face, which was contorted with pain. \u201cI beg your\npardon,\u201d she added, hastily.\n\nBut the wooden man wouldn\u2019t speak another word until they had arrived\nat the Donkey Shelter, when he became cheerful once more.\n\n\u201cLet me introduce you to the Plausible Donkey,\u201d he said, gallantly.\n\n\u201cPleased to meet you, Mr. Donkey,\u201d said Alice, timidly. \u201cWhat beautiful\neyes you have.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe better to see you with, my child,\u201d quoted the Plausible Donkey,\njust to show that he was not such a donkey as he looked. \u201cWhat can I do\nfor you to-day?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you sing?\u201d asked Alice, innocently.\n\n\u201cHeavens!\u201d groaned the wooden man, in her ear. \u201cNow you\u2019ve done it! He\nhas no more voice than a crow!\u201d\n\nBut the Plausible Donkey was pleased by the question.\n\n\u201cIt is not surprising that you do not know my ability in that respect,\u201d\nhe smiled, \u201csince this is your first visit. The fact is\u2015\u2015\u201d He blushed\nmodestly. \u201cThe fact is, I am descended from that notable singer,\nMaxwelton.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaxwelton!\u201d echoed Alice, in surprise. \u201cI thought that was a song.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was originally,\u201d the Plausible Donkey said plausibly. \u201cMy ancestor\nwas named after the song because his brays were bonnie.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Alice, politely; but the wooden man snickered and spoiled it\nall.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re making fun of me,\u201d she cried, with tears in her voice, \u201cand I\ndon\u2019t want to hear you sing now.\u201d\n\nShe hurried away, leaving the wooden man to apologize as best he could\nfor Alice\u2019s impoliteness. He was puffing mightily when he overtook her.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve had enough of animals,\u201d he said between gasps. \u201cLet\u2019s\ngo over and see the books.\u201d It was evident, even to Alice, that he was\ngetting tired of his charge.\n\nThey were in the book department before they knew it\u2015\u2015before Alice\nknew it, at any rate. All around them were books\u2015\u2015heaps and heaps of\nthem\u2015\u2015on tables and shelves, and piled on long counters, and hung up in\nbooths; and in the very center of the immense room, whose horizon could\nnot be seen for the stacks of books, was a great American Eagle, made\nentirely of books, the work of the chief window-dresser, who was a very\nliterary man.\n\n\u201cHave you \u2018The Young Visiters\u2019?\u201d asked Alice.\n\n\u201cYoung visitors!\u201d echoed the wooden man. \u201cSanta Claus has dozens of\nthem\u2015\u2015hundreds\u2015\u2015every day. Thousands, I guess!\u201d\n\n\u201cSilly! It\u2019s a book,\u201d said Alice. \u201cIt was written by a friend of mine,\nDaisy Ashford, when she was only nine years old.\u201d\n\nThe wooden man looked very suspiciously at his charge.\n\n\u201cNobody could write a book at nine,\u201d he said with finality.\n\n\u201cDaisy could, and did,\u201d declared Alice.\n\n\u201cNobody could get it published, anyway,\u201d sneered the wooden man. \u201cOf\ncourse, anybody could write one.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd she had it published, and here it is!\u201d cried Alice, triumphantly.\nShe snatched a book from a long counter, and presented it to her\ncompanion.\n\nThe wooden man cautiously took it, turned it over, and handed it back.\n\n\u201cWhere does it say she is only nine years old?\u201d he demanded.\n\n\u201cIn the preface, of course,\u201d answered Alice. \u201cShe\u2019s older now, but she\nwas only nine when she wrote it.\u201d\n\nShe whirled over the leaves until she found the place.\n\n\u201cThere it is! Sir James Barrie himself says so, in the preface.\u201d\n\n\u201cHumph!\u201d said the wooden man. \u201cHe probably wrote it himself. And he\nwasn\u2019t nine when he wrote it, either, although he\u2019s pretty childish, at\nthat. He\u2019s writing introductions, now, for anybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe would at least know how to spell visitors, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\nThe wooden man stared at the cover. At sight of the title he was\nvisibly shaken.\n\n\u201cIt might be a typographical error,\u201d he ventured. \u201cBut, if you know\nthis Daisy Ashford, what\u2019s her book about?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about a man who\u2015\u2015who was in love with\u2015\u2015with a young woman,\u201d\nlucidly explained Alice. \u201cHe was rather an old man, and\u2015\u2015\u201d\n\n\u201cThen Barrie wrote it!\u201d interrupted the wooden man. \u201cThat ends _that_!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t end anything,\u201d cried Alice, almost in tears. \u201cAnd he\ndoesn\u2019t write as many introductions as H. G. Wells, anyway!\u201d\n\n\u201cO-ho!\u201d said the wooden man. \u201cWell?\u201d\n\n\u201cWells!\u201d said Alice, sharply. \u201cWells, Wells! How many wells make a\nriver?\u201d\n\n\u201cReally,\u201d admonished the wooden man, \u201cyou mustn\u2019t get out of temper. I\ndon\u2019t like Wells any more than you do. I find it difficult to get to\nthe bottom of them....\u201d He fell to singing:\n\n    _Mr. Britling saw it through,\n    That was more than I could do!\n    Central, ring up Heaven\u2019s bells\u2015\u2015\n    Get me God, for H. G. Wells._\n\nAlice appeared shocked at this levity.\n\n\u201cYou should not be so Leviticus,\u201d she said, \u201ceven in a good cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be irrelevant,\u201d replied the wooden man. \u201cI was only\nreviewing Mr. Wells in rhyme. Would you like to hear the next verse?\nIt\u2019s about Amy Lowell.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019d better,\u201d answered Alice, nervously. \u201cIs she\nanything like Daisy Ashford?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not exactly as like as twins,\u201d admitted the wooden man. \u201cYour\nDaisy is rather\u2015\u2015er\u2015\u2015slender, is she not?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, very!\u201d\n\n\u201cThen she\u2019s not,\u201d said the wooden man, with conviction. \u201cI have never\nseen Amy Lowell, but Mr. Bitter Wynner, who was here one day last week,\ntold me that he had got up in a street car and offered to be one of\nthree men to give Miss Lowell a seat.\u201d\n\n\u201cDear me!\u201d exclaimed Alice. \u201cShe needs some of my cake.\u201d\n\n\u201cCake?\u201d asked the wooden man.\n\nBut Alice, fearing she had betrayed herself, would say no more about it.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the wooden man, \u201cwe\u2019ve checked on the doll, and the bird,\nand the books. There was to be a kitten, I believe. That means that\nwe\u2019ll have to go back to the menagerie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t go back to the menagerie,\u201d Alice said firmly, \u201cand if the\nkittens are no more polite than the donkeys, I won\u2019t have one.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask Santa Claus to strike it off the list then, or\nyou\u2019ll have it sure tomorrow morning. And we\u2019ll have to hustle, too,\nfor the old boy closes up at eight o\u2019clock. He went on strike for a\nshorter day, last month\u2015\u2015seven hundred of him\u2015\u2015and after eight o\u2019clock\nhe won\u2019t do a lick of work.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hurry,\u201d cried Alice, breathlessly.\n\nSo they hurried back through the teeming aisles, past the Plausible\nDonkey, who brayed after them jeeringly, past the Singing Bird, which\noffered to finish its song if they would only tarry, past the stuck-up\nQueen of the Dolls, who ogled the Wooden Man, shamefully, and at length\narrived at the cottony dwelling of Santa Claus. But\u2015\u2015alas!\u2015\u2015the door\nnow was closed, and tacked to the outer panel was a large sign, \u201cGone\nto the Races. Back Next Year.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Alice, \u201cisn\u2019t it provoking! Now I shall have to have a\nkitten, after all\u2015\u2015and I suppose it will eat the bird, and scratch the\ndoll, and tear up the books, and make me angry all day long.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo doubt,\u201d said the wooden man, callously.\n\n\u201cBut what does he mean by the races?\u201d asked curious Alice.\n\n\u201cThe reindeer races,\u201d replied the wooden man. \u201cThey race annually on\nSaturn\u2019s race track, and the winning Santa Claus is the boss Santa\nClaus of the year, and makes the rounds on Christmas eve. It doesn\u2019t\ntake a minute to get there, and probably by this time the races are\nover.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope our Santa Claus won, don\u2019t you?\u201d cried Alice.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d asked the wooden man. \u201cThey all look alike.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so,\u201d said Alice, reflectively, \u201cbut this one was very nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re paid to be nice,\u201d said the wooden man cynically. \u201cI\u2019m paid to\nbe nice. You don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been piloting _you_ round all afternoon\nfor fun, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Alice, with spirit, \u201cI like that! I\u2019m sure if I knew\nwho paid you, I\u2019d report you and you wouldn\u2019t get a penny. You don\u2019t\ndeserve it, for you haven\u2019t been nice. I shall leave you, this minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood-bye,\u201d grinned the wooden man, mockingly. \u201cClose the door after\nyou as you go out.\u201d\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201cThat was a very rude wooden man,\u201d thought Alice to herself, as, half\nblinded with tears, she hurried through the snowy streets. \u201cIt is very\nevident that he tore off his thirteenth year. That is the year when\npeople learn to be polite. And he said I was not real! I never knew\ntill I was thirteen how real I was.\u201d\n\nWithout quite knowing where she was going, unconsciously her footsteps\nstrayed toward the shop of the old bookman, the only friend she had\nfound who seemed to be genuine. The precious volume, which once she had\nthought a prison, was safe beneath her arm. Well, she knew now what she\nwould do. She would give it back, and if the old man were so kind as to\nlet her, she would creep back into the pages, and be happy there again\nforever....\n\n\u201cPoor child,\u201d smiled the old bookman, when she had related her\nadventures, and cried over them. \u201cIndeed he did need his thirteenth\nyear. That is the age at which one best appreciates what reality is.\nOnce learned, it is a lesson never to be forgotten. To the child of\nthirteen, all things are real if they are beautiful, and all things\nare unreal which are ugly. Anything is real that we want to be real.\nSensible writers, like Barrie, learn this at thirteen and tear off\n_all_ the remaining years of the calendar. Time passes, but they remain\nthirteen; they improve their style, their appreciation of beautiful\nthings deepens, their outlook is broader and finer, but at heart they\nare still children. They have never escaped from their thirteenth year,\nand they never will\u2015\u2015and they are very glad about it.\u201d\n\nTo this astonishing harangue, Alice had no reply, for truth to tell she\nunderstood very little of it; but it sounded real, and she liked the\nlook on the old bookman\u2019s face as he said it.\n\n\u201cWould you mind, sir,\u201d she timidly asked, \u201cif I were to creep back into\nmy book, and hide again on your shelf?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you quite sure you can manage it?\u201d asked the old man.\n\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Alice, \u201cfor I still have a piece of cake that I brought\nwith me. I had two pieces\u2015\u2015one to make me grow, and one to make me\nsmall again. Just watch me!\u201d\n\nThen she took a few crumbs of cake from her pocket and began to eat\nthem; and the old bookman standing by, saw her shrink down and down and\ndown, until she was such a tiny little thing at his feet that his eyes\ncould barely find her.\n\nHe picked her up gently, and opened the book lying on the counter.\n\n\u201cYou must find the place,\u201d he said: \u201cDo you remember it?\u201d\n\nWith a little sigh of relief, Alice slipped into the right picture,\nwhere, to her great joy, she fitted like a glove\u2015\u2015and suddenly the\npicture was complete again, and the old bookman turning the leaves over\ncould not find her\u2015\u2015there were so many of her, and he did not know\nwhich one was really _her_.\n\nSuddenly the book fell from his hand, and clattered onto the floor,\nstriking his foot as it fell. At the same instant, of course, he awoke,\nsitting in his chair near the old stove. He smiled a little, but was\nnot surprised, for he was used to dreaming strange and pleasant dreams.\nAs he stooped to pick up the book, a customer entered the store.\n\n\u201cWhat have you there?\u201d asked the stranger, looking at the book in the\nold man\u2019s hand. \u201c\u2018Alice in Wonderland?\u2019 Charming thing! What do you ask\nfor it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot this copy,\u201d said the old man, firmly. \u201cThis is my personal copy.\nThis is one book you cannot buy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                    TWO HUNDRED COPIES OF THIS BOOK\n                    WERE PRINTED BY THE TORCH PRESS\n                    CEDAR RAPIDS IOWA IN THE MONTH\n                    OF DECEMBER NINETEEN NINETEEN\n\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n \u2015\u2015Text in italics is enclosed by underscores (_italics_).\n\n \u2015\u2015Printer\u2019s, punctuation, and spelling inaccuracies were silently\n   corrected.\n\n \u2015\u2015Archaic and variable spelling has been preserved.",
