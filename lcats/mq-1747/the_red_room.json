    "body": "\"I can assure you,\" said I, \"that it will take a very tangible ghost to\nfrighten me.\" And I stood up before the fire with my glass in my hand.\n\n\"It is your own choosing,\" said the man with the withered arm, and glanced\nat me askance.\n\n\"Eight-and-twenty years,\" said I, \"I have lived, and never a ghost have I\nseen as yet.\"\n\nThe old woman sat staring hard into the fire, her pale eyes wide open.\n\"Ay,\" she broke in; \"and eight-and-twenty years you have lived and never\nseen the likes of this house, I reckon. There's a many things to see, when\none's still but eight-and-twenty.\" She swayed her head slowly from side to\nside. \"A many things to see and sorrow for.\"\n\nI half suspected the old people were trying to enhance the spiritual\nterrors of their house by their droning insistence. I put down my empty\nglass on the table and looked about the room, and caught a glimpse of\nmyself, abbreviated and broadened to an impossible sturdiness, in the\nqueer old mirror at the end of the room. \"Well,\" I said, \"if I see\nanything to-night, I shall be so much the wiser. For I come to the\nbusiness with an open mind.\"\n\n\"It's your own choosing,\" said the man with the withered arm once more.\n\nI heard the faint sound of a stick and a shambling step on the flags in\nthe passage outside. The door creaked on its hinges as a second old man\nentered, more bent, more wrinkled, more aged even than the first. He\nsupported himself by the help of a crutch, his eyes were covered by\na shade, and his lower lip, half averted, hung pale and pink from his\ndecaying yellow teeth. He made straight for an armchair on the opposite\nside of the table, sat down clumsily, and began to cough. The man with\nthe withered hand gave the newcomer a short glance of positive dislike;\nthe old woman took no notice of his arrival, but remained with her eyes\nfixed steadily on the fire.\n\n\"I said--it's your own choosing,\" said the man with the withered hand,\nwhen the coughing had ceased for a while.\n\n\"It's my own choosing,\" I answered.\n\nThe man with the shade became aware of my presence for the first time,\nand threw his head back for a moment, and sidewise, to see me. I caught\na momentary glimpse of his eyes, small and bright and inflamed. Then he\nbegan to cough and splutter again.\n\n\"Why don't you drink?\" said the man with the withered arm, pushing the\nbeer toward him. The man with the shade poured out a glassful with a\nshaking hand, that splashed half as much again on the deal table. A\nmonstrous shadow of him crouched upon the wall, and mocked his action\nas he poured and drank. I must confess I had scarcely expected these\ngrotesque custodians. There is, to my mind, something inhuman in\nsenility, something crouching and atavistic; the human qualities seem\nto drop from old people insensibly day by day. The three of them made me\nfeel uncomfortable with their gaunt silences, their bent carriage,\ntheir evident unfriendliness to me and to one another. And that night,\nperhaps, I was in the mood for uncomfortable impressions. I resolved to\nget away from their vague fore-shadowings of the evil things upstairs.\n\n\"If,\" said I, \"you will show me to this haunted room of yours, I will\nmake myself comfortable there.\"\n\nThe old man with the cough jerked his head back so suddenly that it\nstartled me, and shot another glance of his red eyes at me from out of\nthe darkness under the shade, but no one answered me. I waited a minute,\nglancing from one to the other. The old woman stared like a dead body,\nglaring into the fire with lack-lustre eyes.\n\n\"If,\" I said, a little louder, \"if you will show me to this haunted room\nof yours, I will relieve you from the task of entertaining me.\"\n\n\"There's a candle on the slab outside the door,\" said the man with the\nwithered hand, looking at my feet as he addressed me. \"But if you go to\nthe Red Room to-night--\"\n\n\"This night of all nights!\" said the old woman, softly.\n\n\"--You go alone.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" I answered, shortly, \"and which way do I go?\"\n\n\"You go along the passage for a bit,\" said he, nodding his head on his\nshoulder at the door, \"until you come to a spiral staircase; and on the\nsecond landing is a door covered with green baize. Go through that, and\ndown the long corridor to the end, and the Red Room is on your left up\nthe steps.\"\n\n\"Have I got that right?\" I said, and repeated his directions.\n\nHe corrected me in one particular.\n\n\"And you are really going?\" said the man with the shade, looking at me\nagain for the third time with that queer, unnatural tilting of the face.\n\n\"This night of all nights!\" whispered the old woman.\n\n\"It is what I came for,\" I said, and moved toward the door. As I did so,\nthe old man with the shade rose and staggered round the table, so as to\nbe closer to the others and to the fire. At the door I turned and\nlooked at them, and saw they were all close together, dark against the\nfirelight, staring at me over their shoulders, with an intent expression\non their ancient faces.\n\n\"Good-night,\" I said, setting the door open. \"It's your own choosing,\"\nsaid the man with the withered arm.\n\nI left the door wide open until the candle was well alight, and then I\nshut them in, and walked down the chilly, echoing passage.\n\nI must confess that the oddness of these three old pensioners in\nwhose charge her ladyship had left the castle, and the deep-toned,\nold-fashioned furniture of the housekeeper's room, in which they\nforegathered, had affected me curiously in spite of my effort to keep\nmyself at a matter-of-fact phase. They seemed to belong to another age,\nan older age, an age when things spiritual were indeed to be feared,\nwhen common sense was uncommon, an age when omens and witches were\ncredible, and ghosts beyond denying. Their very existence, thought I, is\nspectral; the cut of their clothing, fashions born in dead brains; the\nornaments and conveniences in the room about them even are ghostly--the\nthoughts of vanished men, which still haunt rather than participate in\nthe world of to-day. And the passage I was in, long and shadowy, with\na film of moisture glistening on the wall, was as gaunt and cold as a\nthing that is dead and rigid. But with an effort I sent such thoughts\nto the right-about. The long, drafty subterranean passage was chilly and\ndusty, and my candle flared and made the shadows cower and quiver. The\nechoes rang up and down the spiral staircase, and a shadow came sweeping\nup after me, and another fled before me into the darkness overhead. I\ncame to the wide landing and stopped there for a moment listening to a\nrustling that I fancied I heard creeping behind me, and then, satisfied\nof the absolute silence, pushed open the unwilling baize-covered door\nand stood in the silent corridor.\n\nThe effect was scarcely what I expected, for the moonlight, coming in by\nthe great window on the grand staircase, picked out everything in vivid\nblack shadow or reticulated silvery illumination. Everything seemed in\nits proper position; the house might have been deserted on the yesterday\ninstead of twelve months ago. There were candles in the sockets of\nthe sconces, and whatever dust had gathered on the carpets or upon the\npolished flooring was distributed so evenly as to be invisible in my\ncandlelight. A waiting stillness was over everything. I was about to\nadvance, and stopped abruptly. A bronze group stood upon the landing\nhidden from me by a corner of the wall; but its shadow fell with\nmarvelous distinctness upon the white paneling, and gave me the\nimpression of some one crouching to waylay me. The thing jumped upon\nmy attention suddenly. I stood rigid for half a moment, perhaps. Then,\nwith my hand in the pocket that held the revolver, I advanced, only\nto discover a Ganymede and Eagle, glistening in the moonlight. That\nincident for a time restored my nerve, and a dim porcelain Chinaman on a\nbuhl table, whose head rocked as I passed, scarcely startled me.\n\nThe door of the Red Room and the steps up to it were in a shadowy\ncorner. I moved my candle from side to side in order to see clearly the\nnature of the recess in which I stood, before opening the door. Here it\nwas, thought I, that my predecessor was found, and the memory of\nthat story gave me a sudden twinge of apprehension. I glanced over my\nshoulder at the black Ganymede in the moonlight, and opened the door\nof the Red Room rather hastily, with my face half turned to the pallid\nsilence of the corridor.\n\nI entered, closed the door behind me at once, turned the key I found\nin the lock within, and stood with the candle held aloft surveying the\nscene of my vigil, the great Red Room of Lorraine Castle, in which the\nyoung Duke had died; or rather in which he had begun his dying, for\nhe had opened the door and fallen headlong down the steps I had just\nascended. That had been the end of his vigil, of his gallant attempt to\nconquer the ghostly tradition of the place, and never, I thought, had\napoplexy better served the ends of superstition. There were other\nand older stories that clung to the room, back to the half-incredible\nbeginning of it all, the tale of a timid wife and the tragic end that\ncame to her husband's jest of frightening her. And looking round that\nhuge shadowy room with its black window bays, its recesses and alcoves,\nits dusty brown-red hangings and dark gigantic furniture, one could\nwell understand the legends that had sprouted in its black corners, its\ngerminating darknesses. My candle was a little tongue of light in the\nvastness of the chamber; its rays failed to pierce to the opposite\nend of the room, and left an ocean of dull red mystery and suggestion,\nsentinel shadows and watching darknesses beyond its island of light. And\nthe stillness of desolation brooded over it all.\n\nI must confess some impalpable quality of that ancient room disturbed\nme. I tried to fight the feeling down. I resolved to make a systematic\nexamination of the place, and so, by leaving nothing to the imagination,\ndispel the fanciful suggestions of the obscurity before they obtained\na hold upon me. After satisfying myself of the fastening of the door, I\nbegan to walk round the room, peering round each article of furniture,\ntucking up the valances of the bed and opening its curtains wide. In\none place there was a distinct echo to my footsteps, the noises I made\nseemed so little that they enhanced rather than broke the silence of the\nplace. I pulled up the blinds and examined the fastenings of the several\nwindows. Attracted by the fall of a particle of dust, I leaned forward\nand looked up the blackness of the wide chimney. Then, trying to\npreserve my scientific attitude of mind, I walked round and began\ntapping the oak paneling for any secret opening, but I desisted before\nreaching the alcove. I saw my face in a mirror--white.\n\nThere were two big mirrors in the room, each with a pair of sconces\nbearing candles, and on the mantelshelf, too, were candles in china\ncandle-sticks. All these I lit one after the other. The fire was\nlaid--an unexpected consideration from the old housekeeper--and I lit\nit, to keep down any disposition to shiver, and when it was burning\nwell I stood round with my back to it and regarded the room again. I\nhad pulled up a chintz-covered armchair and a table to form a kind of\nbarricade before me. On this lay my revolver, ready to hand. My precise\nexamination had done me a little good, but I still found the remoter\ndarkness of the place and its perfect stillness too stimulating for the\nimagination. The echoing of the stir and crackling of the fire was no\nsort of comfort to me. The shadow in the alcove at the end of the\nroom began to display that undefinable quality of a presence, that odd\nsuggestion of a lurking living thing that comes so easily in silence\nand solitude. And to reassure myself, I walked with a candle into it\nand satisfied myself that there was nothing tangible there. I stood that\ncandle upon the floor of the alcove and left it in that position.\n\nBy this time I was in a state of considerable nervous tension, although\nto my reason there was no adequate cause for my condition. My mind,\nhowever, was perfectly clear. I postulated quite unreservedly that\nnothing supernatural could happen, and to pass the time I began\nstringing some rhymes together, Ingoldsby fashion, concerning the\noriginal legend of the place. A few I spoke aloud, but the echoes were\nnot pleasant. For the same reason I also abandoned, after a time, a\nconversation with myself upon the impossibility of ghosts and haunting.\nMy mind reverted to the three old and distorted people downstairs, and I\ntried to keep it upon that topic.\n\nThe sombre reds and grays of the room troubled me; even with its seven\ncandles the place was merely dim. The light in the alcove flaring in\na draft, and the fire flickering, kept the shadows and penumbra\nperpetually shifting and stirring in a noiseless flighty dance. Casting\nabout for a remedy, I recalled the wax candles I had seen in the\ncorridor, and, with a slight effort, carrying a candle and leaving the\ndoor open, I walked out into the moonlight, and presently returned with\nas many as ten. These I put in the various knick-knacks of china with\nwhich the room was sparsely adorned, and lit and placed them where\nthe shadows had lain deepest, some on the floor, some in the window\nrecesses, arranging and rearranging them until at last my seventeen\ncandles were so placed that not an inch of the room but had the direct\nlight of at least one of them. It occurred to me that when the ghost\ncame I could warn him not to trip over them. The room was now quite\nbrightly illuminated. There was something very cheering and reassuring\nin these little silent streaming flames, and to notice their steady\ndiminution of length offered me an occupation and gave me a reassuring\nsense of the passage of time.\n\nEven with that, however, the brooding expectation of the vigil weighed\nheavily enough upon me. I stood watching the minute hand of my watch\ncreep towards midnight.\n\nThen something happened in the alcove. I did not see the candle go out,\nI simply turned and saw that the darkness was there, as one might start\nand see the unexpected presence of a stranger. The black shadow had\nsprung back to its place. \"By Jove,\" said I aloud, recovering from my\nsurprise, \"that draft's a strong one;\" and taking the matchbox from the\ntable, I walked across the room in a leisurely manner to relight the\ncorner again. My first match would not strike, and as I succeeded with\nthe second, something seemed to blink on the wall before me. I turned my\nhead involuntarily and saw that the two candles on the little table by\nthe fireplace were extinguished. I rose at once to my feet.\n\n\"Odd,\" I said. \"Did I do that myself in a flash of absent-mindedness?\"\n\nI walked back, relit one, and as I did so I saw the candle in the\nright sconce of one of the mirrors wink and go right out, and almost\nimmediately its companion followed it. The flames vanished as if the\nwick had been suddenly nipped between a finger and thumb, leaving the\nwick neither glowing nor smoking, but black. While I stood gaping the\ncandle at the foot of the bed went out, and the shadows seemed to take\nanother step toward me.\n\n\"This won't do!\" said I, and first one and then another candle on the\nmantelshelf followed.\n\n\"What's up?\" I cried, with a queer high note getting into my voice\nsomehow. At that the candle on the corner of the wardrobe went out, and\nthe one I had relit in the alcove followed.\n\n\"Steady on!\" I said, \"those candles are wanted,\" speaking with a\nhalf-hysterical facetiousness, and scratching away at a match the\nwhile, \"for the mantel candlesticks.\" My hands trembled so much that\ntwice I missed the rough paper of the matchbox. As the mantel emerged\nfrom darkness again, two candles in the remoter end of the room were\neclipsed. But with the same match I also relit the larger mirror\ncandles, and those on the floor near the doorway, so that for the moment\nI seemed to gain on the extinctions. But then in a noiseless volley\nthere vanished four lights at once in different corners of the room, and\nI struck another match in quivering haste, and stood hesitating whither\nto take it.\n\nAs I stood undecided, an invisible hand seemed to sweep out the two\ncandles on the table. With a cry of terror I dashed at the alcove, then\ninto the corner and then into the window, relighting three as two more\nvanished by the fireplace, and then, perceiving a better way, I dropped\nmatches on the iron-bound deedbox in the corner, and caught up the\nbedroom candlestick. With this I avoided the delay of striking matches,\nbut for all that the steady process of extinction went on, and the\nshadows I feared and fought against returned, and crept in upon me,\nfirst a step gained on this side of me, then on that. I was now almost\nfrantic with the horror of the coming darkness, and my self-possession\ndeserted me. I leaped panting from candle to candle in a vain struggle\nagainst that remorseless advance.\n\nI bruised myself in the thigh against the table, I sent a chair\nheadlong, I stumbled and fell and whisked the cloth from the table in\nmy fall. My candle rolled away from me and I snatched another as I rose.\nAbruptly this was blown out as I swung it off the table by the wind of\nmy sudden movement, and immediately the two remaining candles followed.\nBut there was light still in the room, a red light, that streamed across\nthe ceiling and staved off the shadows from me. The fire! Of course I\ncould still thrust my candle between the bars and relight it.\n\nI turned to where the flames were still dancing between the glowing\ncoals and splashing red reflections upon the furniture; made two steps\ntoward the grate, and incontinently the flames dwindled and vanished,\nthe glow vanished, the reflections rushed together and disappeared, and\nas I thrust the candle between the bars darkness closed upon me like the\nshutting of an eye, wrapped about me in a stifling embrace, sealed my\nvision, and crushed the last vestiges of self-possession from my brain.\nAnd it was not only palpable darkness, but intolerable terror. The\ncandle fell from my hands. I flung out my arms in a vain effort to\nthrust that ponderous blackness away from me, and lifting up my voice,\nscreamed with all my might, once, twice, thrice. Then I think I must\nhave staggered to my feet. I know I thought suddenly of the moonlit\ncorridor, and with my head bowed and my arms over my face, made a\nstumbling run for the door.\n\nBut I had forgotten the exact position of the door, and I struck myself\nheavily against the corner of the bed. I staggered back, turned, and was\neither struck or struck myself against some other bulky furnishing. I\nhave a vague memory of battering myself thus to and fro in the darkness,\nof a heavy blow at last upon my forehead, of a horrible sensation\nof falling that lasted an age, of my last frantic effort to keep my\nfooting, and then I remember no more.\n\nI opened my eyes in daylight. My head was roughly bandaged, and the man\nwith the withered hand was watching my face. I looked about me trying\nto remember what had happened, and for a space I could not recollect.\nI rolled my eyes into the corner and saw the old woman, no longer\nabstracted, no longer terrible, pouring out some drops of medicine\nfrom a little blue phial into a glass. \"Where am I?\" I said. \"I seem to\nremember you, and yet I can not remember who you are.\"\n\nThey told me then, and I heard of the haunted Red Room as one who hears\na tale. \"We found you at dawn,\" said he, \"and there was blood on your\nforehead and lips.\"\n\nI wondered that I had ever disliked him. The three of them in the\ndaylight seemed commonplace old folk enough. The man with the green\nshade had his head bent as one who sleeps.\n\nIt was very slowly I recovered the memory of my experience. \"You\nbelieve now,\" said the old man with the withered hand, \"that the room is\nhaunted?\" He spoke no longer as one who greets an intruder, but as one\nwho condoles with a friend.\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"the room is haunted.\"\n\n\"And you have seen it. And we who have been here all our lives have\nnever set eyes upon it. Because we have never dared. Tell us, is it\ntruly the old earl who--\"\n\n\"No,\" said I, \"it is not.\"\n\n\"I told you so,\" said the old lady, with the glass in her hand. \"It is\nhis poor young countess who was frightened--\"\n\n\"It is not,\" I said. \"There is neither ghost of earl nor ghost of\ncountess in that room; there is no ghost there at all, but worse, far\nworse, something impalpable--\"\n\n\"Well?\" they said.\n\n\"The worst of all the things that haunt poor mortal men,\" said I; \"and\nthat is, in all its nakedness--'Fear!' Fear that will not have light\nnor sound, that will not bear with reason, that deafens and darkens and\noverwhelms. It followed me through the corridor, it fought against me in\nthe room--\"\n\nI stopped abruptly. There was an interval of silence. My hand went up to\nmy bandages. \"The candles went out one after another, and I fled--\"\n\nThen the man with the shade lifted his face sideways to see me and\nspoke.\n\n\"That is it,\" said he. \"I knew that was it. A Power of Darkness. To put\nsuch a curse upon a home! It lurks there always. You can feel it even\nin the daytime, even of a bright summer's day, in the hangings, in the\ncurtains, keeping behind you however you face about. In the dusk it\ncreeps in the corridor and follows you, so that you dare not turn. It is\neven as you say. Fear itself is in that room. Black Fear.... And there\nit will be... so long as this house of sin endures.\"",
