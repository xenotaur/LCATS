Schule, S.E.D.:\n\n\"Even then, in the beginning of the twenty-third century, crime per\nse, itself had ceased to exist. The lower emotions had already been\nbred out of the people. Envy, hate, avarice and kindred responses were\nvirtually non-existent. Every citizen had a crude type of emotiograph\nattached to his person, which was examined periodically by the Eye. If\nany deviation from the norm was observed, the accused was called up for\nquestioning.\n\n\"In the absence of actual crime, any emotion which might have\nprecipitated crime was considered unlawful, and men were tried for\ntoo much anger, or too little pity. The only purpose of a trial was\nto ascertain whether sufficient provocation could be established to\nwarrant a given reaction. If the cause, or the incident, justified the\nemotional response, the defendant was exculpated.\n\n\"Trial procedure was extremely simple. The use of the witness was\nobsolete. Above the defendant's box was a concentric screen upon which\nhis thoughts could be projected. The Questioner would channel the\nthoughts of the accused into whatever date periods were pertinent, and\nin that way, the defendant reviewed his own case.\n\n\"It is into this category that the celebrated, and very controversial,\nJohn Hastings case falls. You all remember that, of course, as the\n'cause c\u00eal\u00eabre' of the year 2375 A.D.\"\n\nNo. Amer. Sec., Book Two, p. 675.\n\n\n\nOne night they watched a column of flame lift a silver speck into the\nsky. And one night, much later, they heard a voice call into space,\nsaying, \"Come back, John Hastings, come back.\n\n\"Our inspection has shown serious deviations in your emotiograph. You\nwill turn your rocket and rechart for Earth, John Hastings. For trial,\nJohn Hastings.\"\n\nAnd they came to the trial. Out of the ripe, wet hills, down from the\nblistering dome over the city, up through the shafts of the gritty\nSubstructure. They came and stood in lines, wiping the August sweat\nfrom their eyes, littering the levels with orange peels as they ate.\nWomen, with babies strapped to their shoulders, and suppers left\nunradiated on the cooker. Men, with lead-shielded faces, and tools\nlaid aside in the middle of a movement. But they came, and stood and\njostled one another, milling and gossiping:\n\n\"Gonna be some trial!\"\n\n\"... might even resort to electrocution....\"\n\n\"Naw, that's dark time methods.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah?\"\n\nOh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah....\n\nBut they felt good, the people, for it wasn't their trial. The words\ncould come easy and undammed, for it was John Hastings who was on\ntrial. They could look at him all they wanted to, and talk.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, they could look at me too. Because I was called as\nthe thirteenth juror on the John Hastings trial.\n\n\n\nI walked into it after a night that held no sleep. And looked at\nit. The yawning amphitheatre where humanity poured. And saw it. The\nthirteen chairs raised high in the center. And heard it. The crowd's\nsusurrus gentling under insistent reminders from a bodiless Questioner.\n\nI glanced at the faces in the other twelve boxes, recognizing some\nof them. Angus Vortler, the psychosurgeon. William Bax, head of\nIntergalactic, a bleak, wintery man who doodled constantly. Dollar\nsigns, probably. Fred Kitson, of the horny palms, chief mechanic on the\n_Darkness_. All men who, because they had once reached out and touched\nhands with John Hastings, were now called to judge him. Several of them\nnodded to me as I took my place.\n\nWait.\n\nThey brought him in. I remembered the first time I had ever seen\nhim, in the classroom. Eager and tall ... tall and eager. Lord, what\nchanged him? Something had taken the straightness from his shoulders,\nthe sureness from his stride. There were furrows on his face where the\ntears had already been.\n\nHe stood silently in the box where they had put him. A box just big\nenough for his bulky body, and maybe a little of the misery he carried\nwith him.\n\nA voice spoke.\n\n\"This, John Hastings, is your trial. You stand before this Court of\nTruth-Probity, accused of registering the emotion of hate. A hatred\nso violent, that had we permitted you to carry out your anticipated\nactions, it would have resulted in the murder of one Mary Hastings,\nyour wife. Do you understand the charge?\"\n\n\"I do.\" He didn't know what to do with his hands.\n\n\"How do you plead?\"\n\n\"I plead not guilty.\"\n\n\"On what ground?\" asked the voice.\n\nThe defendant raised his head. \"On the ground that I had good and\nsufficient reason to justify my emotion.\"\n\n\"The reactographs on your wife, Mary Hastings, have been thoroughly\nexamined, and it has been determined that she performed no act which in\nany way deviated from the norm. Had any disturbances taken place within\nMary Hastings during the week of last March ninth to sixteenth, it\nwould have shown up plainly in a flux on the charts. Your contention is\nimpossible.\"\n\nThe man in the box bit his lip. \"Nevertheless, I contend it. My wife\ngave me sufficient reason. She--she was unfaithful to me.\"\n\nOnly silence for a full minute.\n\n\"It is impossible.\"\n\n\"_But_ true!\" Hastings shouted.\n\nThe multitude leaned forward, a misted inquiry rustling its skirts.\n\n\"Very well,\" the voice almost sighed. \"Will you submit, Captain\nHastings, to the use of the concentric screen? We wish to know more of\nthe circumstances surrounding several pertinent dates.\"\n\nHis face was the color of picked bones. \"Yes, I will submit.\"\n\nTwo men advanced carrying a mesh complexity between them. Placing it\nover the defendant's head they allowed it to fall to his shoulders.\n\n\"Are you ready, John Hastings?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" It seemed he was already gone from the place.\n\n\"Then concentrate. Remember. Permit your mind to have freedom.\" The\nvoice washed over him in waves. \"It is a day in December ... the\nfourteenth.... Take my words and let them carry you....\"\n\nThe screen above the defendant's head began to cloud and draw in.\n\n\"It is cold outside ... the snow is falling. There is a warm room. A\nfire is burning....\"\n\nThe mists opalesced and formed a nucleus.\n\n\"There is a pool of light on the desk, unexpected flowers in a bowl,\nthe odor of duck, roasted brown....\"\n\nSomething was struggling for existence in the screen.\n\n\"There is a brown-haired woman--\"\n\nAnd the image was born....\n\n\n\nShe bent over a card. \"Candlelight, best service for two, white wine,\ncelebration atmosphere,\" she wrote and put it into the dining table\nselector. Somewhere an orchestra started playing Debussy.\n\n\"John,\" she called. \"Almost ready.\"\n\nA card shot back at her from the mirror as she passed. \"Your nose is\nshiny,\" it read. She powdered quickly, taming wisps of hair as an\nafterthought.\n\n\"Any further comments?\" she wanted to know, and held out her hand. A\nsecond card appeared. \"I can't whistle.\"\n\nHer laughter brimmed over, laced in delight. \"John, dinner's ready.\"\n\nShe called into three rooms, empty rooms. Crossing to the terrace, she\nopened a door on the night. Snowflakes rode in on an icy draft.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"John! What are you doing out there? I can't even see you.\"\n\n\"That seems to be one of your habits recently.\"\n\nShe drew him inside, and leaned against the door, closing. \"Is it going\nto be like that tonight?\"\n\n\"Maybe.\" His face was steeped in cold.\n\n\"Please. Not the day before you go.\"\n\nThe white crystals on his hair melted into drops, and a sudden warmth\nstrained all harshness from his voice. \"No, you're right, Mary. Not the\nday before I go.\"\n\nPushing him toward the fire, Mary took his cloak. \"Didn't you notice?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The table, silly. It's 'Happy Homecoming' tonight!\"\n\n\"Leavestaking, you mean.\"\n\n\"No, homecoming. It's not December. It's August. You've just opened\nthe front door and said, 'Mary, I'm home!' And all the time in between\nhasn't been. It never will be.\"\n\nHe smiled for the first time.\n\n\"Now that's better.\"\n\nThe woman handed John Hastings a goblet, plump with yellow liquid. \"To\nAugust, dear,\" she said, and raised her glass. \"To the moment your foot\ntouches Earth again. And to the wine ... warm and golden, like our life\ntogether.\"\n\n\"Let's eat,\" he said. \"Let's not ask questions.\" He faltered in a lack\nof direction.\n\n\"Wait a minute.\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"For the questions you can't ask.\" The gaiety was gone. It was real\nnow. \"I think it's time we swept out the corners.\"\n\nJohn nodded, his face slack.\n\n\"You've been strange lately.\"\n\n\"Oh that!\" he shrugged. \"Let's say it's the getting ready ... the heart\nplunge just before you jump into space.\"\n\n\"No.\" It was definite. \"It's more than that. You've been a rocket man\nall your life. You don't get nervous any more.\"\n\nHis fingers twisted the glass. Something else twisted his voice. \"There\nare things in it that might make a man nervous, Mary. Black winds.\nBurning worlds. Holes in space waiting for him. You think it might be\nthat, Mary?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"But this is Alpha Centauri. This is faster-than-light.\" He bowed.\n\"This is when baby-God Hastings tests his brain child ... when the\nelectron lightscope goes to bat. You think it might be that, Mary?\"\n\n\"Don't make nasty fun.\"\n\n\n\nHer husband regarded her a long, serious moment. \"No. You're right\nagain.\" Leaning in to her, he spoke softly. \"Did you know, Mary, that\nit isn't the big things that make a man nervous any more? Only the\nlittle things--\"\n\n\"Say it!\" she insisted. \"Get it out. You'll feel better.\"\n\nHe hadn't moved. \"Just the very little things. A supper unradiated. An\nempty wrap hanger. An unfilled chair. Emptiness where there should be\nsomething.\"\n\n\"Where has there been emptiness?\" Mary was surprised.\n\n\"Between us.\"\n\n\"Oh darling ... that just isn't so.\"\n\n\"Isn't it?\" He took her hands. \"Cards on the table, Mary. Right?\"\n\n\"Right!\"\n\n\"You've been going to meetings for the last month.\"\n\n\"It's my turn on the committee.\"\n\n\"You've been out late quite a bit.\"\n\n\"I can't leave till they check me out....\"\n\n\"There have been other people there.\"\n\nShe pulled her hands away and escaped to the other side of the room.\n\"Lots of them.\"\n\n\"But there was _one_ face in particular.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" There was a finality in it. \"Who told you?\"\n\n\"Does that matter?\" His hand waved it aside. \"Why didn't you tell me\nCharles Lathrop was on the committee with you?\"\n\n\"Because I knew how you'd feel.\" Instantly, she was at his side. \"Oh\ndarling, don't you suppose I know what you think? You've never accepted\nthe fact that when I married you, my feeling for him was over and done.\"\n\n\"Is that true?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes! Can't you understand? What I felt for him four or five\nyears ago was that young thing everyone goes through.\"\n\n\"Young things grow. Great oaks....\"\n\n\"Not this one. When you came, it was over. Is over.\"\n\nHe shook his head, and passed his hand over his face. \"God knows I want\nto believe that. You're my wife, Mary. I love every bit of you. But\nLathrop keeps bobbing up.\"\n\nThe fire crackled like dry leaves, rouging the unhappy walls. \"There\nare more questions?\" she wanted to know.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Ask them.\"\n\n\"Did you know he was going to be on the committee?\"\n\n\"Of course not.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, Mary, but--but have you spent any extra time with him?\"\n\n\"Oh John! We _talk_ at the meetings--'Hello--it's a roaring day--have\nyou heard the latest about Ganymede?'\"\n\n\"That's all?\"\n\n\"I swear.\"\n\n\"You don't feel anything?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Absolutely nothing. He's a friend, a brother, a comfortable\ndog.\"\n\nThe stiffness went out of Hastings. He sank back breathing hard, as\nif he had been running too fast. \"Mary, you don't know how good that\nhears. You just don't know!\"\n\n\"Oh my darling!\" She held his head in her arms, her mouth close to his\near. \"Has it been this, all these months?\"\n\nThe man nodded, laughing a little. \"I just couldn't take the thought\nthat maybe--\"\n\n\"Hush, hush! Don't even say it any more. Drink the wine and remember\nwhat I said ... 'To its warm glow, like our home together.'\"\n\nHis hand reached out, and trembling slightly, the fingers grasped, and\nfumbled, and clutched at air. The glass shattered prettily, spilling\nits golden life on the unalterable stone throat of the hearth.\n\nAnd they stood there, hands untouching. Watching the glistening\nfragments trap the last warm glow of the fire.\n\n\n\n\"Enough, enough,\" a voice said. \"You will rechannel your thoughts,\nCaptain Hastings. There is another day in time.\"\n\nThe screen misted, and the veils swirled.\n\n\"March eleventh ... on a ship ... a glazed splinter in blackness....\"\n\nThe curtains quivered.\n\n\"Men gather tight against the void ... a clarinet wails ... there is\nthe smell of sweat....\"\n\nKitson and Holmes were doing a dance. They had their breechskins rolled\nover their knees, and four grapefruit tied to their fronts.\n\n\"Take it off ... take it off ... _take it off_!\" The men rode a ground\nswell of tinny music. Rhythm stamped out in the pattern of magnetic\nboots fought with the sucking sound of beer cans. The air curled with\nsmoke.\n\nAbove their heads a hatch opened, and the Captain's legs appeared,\ndescending ladderwise. Abruptly, the melee subsided into leftover\nclarinet tones.\n\n\"Mr. Kitson.\"\n\nKitson brought himself to attention, his grapefruit swinging. \"Sir?\"\n\n\"I've been informed there was news from home.\" The men looked at one\nanother.\n\n\"Only the broadcast from the Sector, sir. Nothing unusual.\"\n\n\"You took it down on the tapes?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I should like to hear it.\" From one corner a reluctant shuffling\nreplaced the lately dead downbeats. The reproducer scratched badly.\n\n\"... at a banquet given for members of the committee. Prominent among\nthe guests was Mrs. Mary A. Hastings, wife of Captain John Hastings who\nis making history in his FTL flight to Alpha Centauri. Captain Hastings\nwill test his invention, the electron-lightscope, from our neighboring\nsun. It is reliably reported that the lightscope will revolutionize\nastral observation, in that it will replace the telescope, and will\nbring distant galaxies to within a few hundred feet of the earth.\n\n\"Mrs. Hastings, smartly gowned, was seated next to Co-ordinator Charles\nLathrop, who had--\"\n\nSomeone jostled into the machine. The groove was lost.\n\nHastings spoke slowly. \"I'd like to hear the rest of it.\"\n\nKitson was carefully unrolling his breechskins.\n\n\"I'd like to hear the rest of it, I said.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" someone murmured.\n\n\"... was seated next to Charles Lathrop, who had escorted her to the\nbanquet, in the absence of the Captain. They danced frequently to the\nstrains of the Deimos Orchestra which was rocketed here for the pro--\"\n\n\"That's enough,\" said Hastings, staring whitely.\n\nThe mechanic took two steps toward him. \"Is something wrong, sir? You\nlook ill.\"\n\n\"Not at all, Mr. Kitson, not at all.\" His eyes snapped back to the man\nin front of him, astraddle a newborn idea. \"I was merely considering\nPeeping Toms, Mr. Kitson.\"\n\n\"Beg pardon, Sir?\"\n\n\"Peeping Toms. Never heard of them, have you?\"\n\n\"No, sir. I don't think any of us have.\"\n\n\"What a pity. A most fascinating subject. Found in a twentieth century\nhistory of the minor vices.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You display no curiosity, Mr. Kitson.\" His eyebrows raised. \"In this,\nyou differ significantly from our Peeping Tom. _He_ wanted to know\na great many things, and he settled the whole matter with a pair of\nbinoculars.\" His voice sounded like scraped stone. \"Yes indeed--_a pair\nof binoculars_.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I wasn't subjected to that facet of knowledge\nindoctrination, sir.\" Kitson shrugged imperceptibly. When the captain\ngot like this--his shoulders spoke for him.\n\nHastings had caught the movement, however. \"You find my words\nuninstructive?\"\n\n\"No, sir--I mean--\"\n\n\"Very well.\" Something was growing big in the man. \"Since you view your\ndeficiencies so lightly, you may report for punishment duty in the\nmorning.\"\n\n\"But, sir! I only said--\"\n\n\"That will be all, Mr. Kitson.\" Hastings climbed the ladder, an ear\nsplitting silence hurrying him upward. His face appeared through\nthe hatch. A face withdrawn behind vacant eyes, ready to crumble.\n\"Remember, Kitson, I'll see you topside tomorrow. You will endeavor to\ncompensate for this most regrettable omission in your education, while\nI--I will contemplate the advantages of twentieth century sins.\"\n\nThe hatch closed.\n\nEveryone was suddenly very busy. Holmes picked up empty beer containers\nand threw them into the deatomizer. A big sandy man laced and unlaced\nthe binding-pad on his bunk. Kitson sat down and stared vacantly.\n\nAfter three or four minutes he said something.\n\n\"The sonovagun,\" he said. \"The poor, poor, sonovagun.\"\n\n\n\nImpersonal words broke into the dream. \"We have seen. It is\nsufficient.\" The screen flickered and grew dim. \"Can you stand further\nprobing, Captain? May we proceed?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"There is yet one more time. March fifteenth.\"\n\n\"I remember.\"\n\n\"Then relax ... drift. There are two men. They hang above a yellow\nsun ... space sleeps at their feet....\"\n\nAn image formed and wavered and formed again.\n\n\"Their words are whispered ... they speak softly in the presence of\nimmensity....\"\n\nIt crystallized....\n\n\"I'm asking as Vortler, your friend. Not Vortler, the psychosurgeon.\"\n\nSide by side, they sat in the tattered light of the observation hull.\nCentauri lay less than one day ahead. It dangled like a full, blush\npeach, their silhouette its only bruised spot. Rockets hummed.\n\n\"There's no use asking any more questions Angus. The time for questions\nis past. This is exams.\"\n\n\"That's what I mean, John. Remarks like that. You've gotten to be a man\nwho talks to himself.\"\n\nHastings sat without moving a muscle. \"What did the men tell you?\"\n\n\"Nothing actually.\" The other made a nasty sound. \"No, that's true. I\ndidn't need them. I've seen it for myself this entire trip.\"\n\n\"And how do you diagnose it, Doctor?\" A whisky bottle gleamed in the\nlight of the creamy sun.\n\n\"Just like that, he wants it. In two or three words. Where I need\nbooks, where Freud took volumes, he wants it in two or three words.\"\n\n\"And the doctor doesn't have them,\" John said. Angus shook his head.\n\"But I do.\" He poured from the bottle. \"She's seeing Charles.\"\n\nVortler snorted. \"You're mistaken.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not. I've thought about her a lot these last three months, and\nI think I know her now.\" He leaned his head back and shut his eyes.\n\"She's an August woman, Angus. An August woman. One night a warm breeze\ncomes through the door and sweeps a girl into your arms. You say\nthings, and she says things, and you both end up saying 'I do!' Then\nshe wakes up one morning to find she _doesn't_ any more. And another\ndoor will open, another breeze carry her off.\"\n\n\"Mary's not like that.\"\n\n\"I didn't think so in the beginning.\"\n\n\"You surprise me, John. I thought you had more faith.\"\n\n\"Not any more. With me, it's what I can touch or smell or hear or see.\nNothing more.\"\n\n\"Then there's never any proof for you. You can't watch her every\nminute.\"\n\nJohn raised himself unsteadily, and stitched his finger into the air.\n\"That, my dear Doctor, is where you are wrong.\" He stood and groped his\nway into the light of the cabin. Angus followed, trying to see his face.\n\n\"There is something more to this, John. Let's stop the riddles and say\nwhat we mean.\"\n\nThe captain spun in sharp, stifled anger. \"Shall I tell you, Angus?\nShall I let you in on my secret?\" The anger detonated. \"All right, damn\nit! You came here for it. I'll give it to you! You know my lightscope?\nWell, it works. It works fine!\"\n\n\"What has this--?\"\n\n\"Do you know what Johnny-boy has been doing with the blasted thing?\" he\ncried, \"I've been using it to play inquirer. I've been using it to spy\non my wife.\"\n\nThe doctor's jaw dropped. \"You have _what_?\"\n\n\"That's right. Night after night, I've come back here. I've set up the\ngod-dammed thing--and I've scanned.\"\n\n\"This is incredible!\"\n\n\"Three nights ago I found New York. Two nights ago, I co-ordinated\nto the Hudson River. Last night I got as far as the third level.\nTonight--\" his arms swept a circle--\"East Lynne.\"\n\nVortler's hand smashed down. \"It's got to stop! There's no reason for\nthis. I won't permit it.\"\n\n\"What can you do? It's my lightscope--my ship. My orders supersede\nyours.\"\n\nVortler closed the space between them, his fists knobbed white. John\nlaughed. \"Don't overdo it, Angus. I'm not worth it.\" The sound died to\na chuckle, \"Besides, remember your emotiograph. Somebody will spank.\"\n\nThe doctor's hands opened slowly, a finger at a time.\n\n\"Tell me, Angus. Can you honestly blame me? I suspect my wife. I'm\ntrying to find out.\"\n\n\"But you're wrong!\"\n\n\"It _could_ be. The thing is possible.\" He leaned toward the\npsychosurgeon. \"You think about it and tell me. It's _possible_?\"\n\nVortler looked defeated.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And that's that.\"\n\nAngus started for the barway. \"I don't know what started this thing\noff, John. Perhaps if a man loves his wife a little too much, a thing\nlike this can happen. Maybe that's why they've watched our charts so\ncarefully.\"\n\nHastings was already talking to himself. \"If I can just prove it one\nway or the other. If I can just know she's--alone.\"\n\nThe white clad figure paused. \"Think it over, John. Change your mind. I\ndon't like any part of it.\"\n\n\"Angus,\" John said softly. \"I don't like it either. I don't want the\nsight of Mary on that lens! To leave what print? A dream smashed? A\ndishonor? Who knows?\"\n\nThe doctor shook his head. \"Look out the viewplate, John. What do you\nsee? Planet systems, galaxies, eons. What is one tiny less-than-a-mite\nin all of that? What does it mean to you? The mind of the Almighty--or\na few cents worth of bone, and hair, and tissue? Ask yourself, John.\nWhat do you see?\"\n\nHe closed the barway behind him.\n\nJohn followed and threw the pressure lock. Going to a sleek instrument,\nhis hands inquired softly along its lines. Cold as space. Sure. Doubt\nproof. He swept the litter from his desk, and set the instrument in\nits center. Levers spun, mirrors sent out chips of light, adjusters\nadjusted.\n\nThen, pausing, he moved to the viewplate and stood looking out a long\ntime. His hands mangled themselves constantly behind his back. A star\ntwinkled--one star in particular--as if through the prism of a cold\ntear.\n\nBut he went back to the instrument, and bent to it slowly. And as he\ngripped the desk, his knuckles erupted, pale as washed gravestones....\n\n_And the graph lines shivered and glowed hot, and the hate came pouring\nout of the shining needle between the stars, and somewhere a voice\ncalled into space...._\n\n\n\n\"Come back, John Hastings, come back,\" the Questioner said. \"You may\nreturn to the present.\"\n\nThrobbing, the screen died as a stirring exhalation came from the\ncrowd. Someone asked for more air. A baby cried, and was lulled to\nsleep.\n\n\"We have seen the pictures, Captain Hastings, and we accept them. The\nfacts were presented as they happened. It is unfortunate that we can\nshow no evidence of what reached John Hastings' eye as he looked into\nthe electron-lightscope. Mechanical tabulations cannot be transmitted\nto our screen, since its envisioning powers are limited to the sensory\nmemory patterns of the brain. We must therefore go to the defendant\nhimself for further evidence.\"\n\nThey had removed the heavy mesh, but the captain's head remained bowed.\n\n\"Do you swear, John Hastings, that by the power of the God whom we know\nto be, and by the strength of your own mind, you will tell us what you\nsaw in that instrument?\"\n\n\"I do so swear.\"\n\n\"You may proceed.\"\n\nHe drew himself together. \"I found her at her mother's house. Even\nthough it's vacant now, she liked to go back there occasionally when I\nwas away.\"\n\nThe twelve other jurors were leaning forward in their boxes. I could\nfeel my body itching from the strain.\n\n\"You located her at her mother's house, at 4AH54 on the Third Level,\nEighty-first Sector, west of the Hudson?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Continue.\"\n\n\"She was sitting on the lawn in front of the house, talking to a man.\nHis back was toward me.\"\n\n\"You could not see his face?\"\n\n\"Not then.\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"They talked for a while. Then he moved to her on the grass. She smiled\nand they put their arms around one another. He kissed her.\"\n\n\"What happened then?\"\n\n\"He lifted her to her feet, and I saw it was Charles Lathrop. They went\nto the door, and she opened it.\" He found it hard to get the words past\nhis lips.\n\n\"Please proceed.\"\n\n\"When she got inside, she turned around and smiled. It looked as if\nshe was laughing at me. Then she reached out and touched his arm.\nShe--she--\"\n\n\"Please speak louder. She what?\"\n\n\"She took him inside and shut the door.\"\n\nHeaped silence greeted the words. Men turned quietly and gazed at their\nwives, their eyes asking a question for the bewildered, the undecided.\n\n\"John Hastings, we have checked thoroughly. Your wife did spend the\nnight of the fifteenth in the vacant house of which you speak. She\nspent the night, however, alone. Her graphs show no disturbances, no\nemotional exhilaration. You are perpetrating an untruth.\"\n\n\"I'm not. I saw it! I saw it as plainly as I can see the box in which I\nam standing now.\"\n\n\"You could not have seen it.\"\n\n\"Before my God, I did! I saw every detail. The yellow pannier she wore.\nThe blue hydrangea bush on the lawn. That broken aneroid beside the\ndoor. Every detail.\" His voice crescendoed.\n\n\"It is impossible.\"\n\n\n\nHe raised his fists in the air. \"Say it's impossible if you like.\nRepeat it a thousand times! But I saw her do it just the same!! I _saw_\nit!\"\n\nSomething inside me had pulled tight. Thoughts of the classroom flooded\ninto my mind. Long forgotten formulae, theories ... somewhere! The\nvoice droned on, charging the jurors:\n\n\"--having reviewed the evidence--\"\n\nI kept groping toward a page in a book. Somewhere there was a piece\nthat would fit in. \"The majority ballot rules.\" It was going too fast\nfor me. They were calling for the vote.\n\n\"Juror Number One, please stand and tell the court; how do you find?\"\n\nWith great deliberation, he turned his back on the defendant in the box.\n\n\"Juror Number One designates guilt. Juror Number Two, how do you find?\"\n\nVortler was second. He stood and gazed at John Hastings for a long\nmoment. Then he raised his arms toward the defendant, palms upward.\n\n\"Juror Number Two designates innocence.\"\n\nI went back to the classroom again and again. There was a thing waiting\nthere for me, but it had been so long ago.\n\nThe count was going fast....\n\n\"Juror Number Six, how do you find?\" Bax. I knew his vote before he\ncast it. He turned his back.\n\nWhere did it stand now? Four guilty, two innocent!\n\nMy heart began to pound. It felt as if I were standing on the edge of a\ndeep water. Where was it, that I groped after? I tried to shut myself\nin and think.\n\nThe semi-circle was almost completed. The voice had reached the juror\non my left. Six men stood with their backs to John Hastings. Five stood\nwith their arms outstretched, \"Juror Number Twelve, how do you find?\"\n\nI asked for help then. I asked the Lord to turn the pages. And I asked\nHim to help Kitson too. Kitson raised his arms high. The score was even.\n\nIt waited until then to come. The piece ... the little piece, falling\non my brain from that half-forgotten book.\n\n\"Juror Number Thirteen, how do--?\"\n\n\"Mr. Questioner,\" I cried. \"I would like to interpose.\"\n\n\"It is incorrect procedure to interrupt the vote--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I know.\" My voice shook. \"But there is something I just\nremembered. Something pertinent to what John Hastings saw.\"\n\n\"Can it prove anything further one way or the other?\"\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\nAn unseen conference. \"Very well. Dispensation granted. What is your\ninformation?\"\n\nI took a deep breath. \"John Hastings viewed his wife on Earth from one\nof the planets of Alpha Centauri.\"\n\n\"That is correct.\"\n\nMy tongue was dry; my hands wet.\n\n\"Alpha Centauri is four years, four months distant, measuring in light\nyears. Therefore, in his travel, John Hastings lost three of those\nmonths, but when he turned his instrument backward, he was looking at\nlight images which had started from the Earth long before he ever left\nit. He was looking at--\"\n\n\"_At ... what happened four years ago...._\" John Hastings had finished\nthe sentence for me. He was looking at something as if it were the\nfirst sunrise he had ever known.\n\nSpeculation brought the amphitheatre to its feet. For the only time\nduring the trial, the mob found its voice. Uncertainty, relief and\nsurprise mingled, ebbed and flowed.\n\nThe voice called for attention. \"Quiet, please, quiet. The information\nis correct,\" and the storm was over.\n\n\"Since the jury is thus far hung, we will leave the decision to the\nlast, thirteenth talisman. We would like your vote, Juror Thirteen. How\ndo you find?\"\n\nJohn looked at me. It was the first time since they had brought him in.\n\nAnd I stretched my arms out toward him....\n\nWho can say whether I was right or wrong? It is too delicate a thing to\ncome out all white or all black. But I think that in order for a man to\nhate a woman so very much, it is also necessary for him to have loved\nher very much, too.\n\nAnd sometimes, I wake up, shaking, in the night. I am thinking of what\nmight have happened if I hadn't remembered that old discarded pannier,\nor the way Mother transplanted the blue hydrangea bush before she died,\nor how Dad swore when she made him throw that aneroid away. If I hadn't\nremembered those things, I would never have seen the look on John's\nface as he walked into my outstretched arms and said: \"Is it time for\nus to go home now, Mary? Is it?\"",
