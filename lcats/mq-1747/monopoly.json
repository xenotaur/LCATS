    "body": "\"That all, chief? Gonna quit now?\"\n\nBrian Hanson looked disgustedly at Pete Brent, his lanky assistant.\nThat was the first sign of animation he had displayed all day.\n\n\"I am, but you're not,\" Hanson told him grimly. \"Get your notes\nstraightened up. Run those centrifuge tests and set up the still so we\ncan get at that vitamin count early in the morning.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow morning? Aw, for gosh sakes, chief, why don't you take a day\noff sometime, or better yet, a night off. It'd do you good to relax.\nBoy, I know a swell blonde you could go for. Wait a minute, I've got\nher radiophone number somewhere--just ask for Myrtle.\"\n\nHanson shrugged himself out of his smock.\n\n\"Never mind Myrtle, just have that equipment set up for the morning.\nGood night.\" He strode out of the huge laboratory, but his mind was\nstill on the vitamin research they had been conducting, he barely heard\nthe remarks that followed him.\n\n\"One of these days the chief is going to have his glands catch up with\nhim.\"\n\n\"Not a chance,\" Pete Brent grunted.\n\nBrian Hanson wondered dispassionately for a moment how his assistants\ncould fail to be as absorbed as he was by the work they were doing,\nthen he let it go as he stepped outside the research building.\n\nHe paused and let his eyes lift to the buildings that surrounded the\ncompound. This was the administrative heart of Venus City. Out here,\nalone, he let his only known emotion sweep through him, pride. He had\nan important role in the building of this great new city. As head of\nthe Venus Consolidated Research Organization, he was in large part\nresponsible for the prosperity of this vigorous, young world. Venus\nConsolidated had built up this city and practically everything else\nthat amounted to anything on this planet. True, there had been others,\npioneers, before the company came, who objected to the expansion of the\nmonopolistic control. But, if they could not realize that the company's\nregime served the best interests of the planet, they would just have to\nsuffer the consequences of their own ignorance. There had been rumors\nof revolution among the disgruntled older families.\n\nHe heard there had been killings, but that was nonsense. Venus\nConsolidated police had only powers of arrest. Anything involving\nexecutions had to be referred to the Interplanetary Council on Earth.\nHe dismissed the whole business as he did everything else that did not\ndirectly influence his own department.\n\nHe ignored the surface transport system and walked to his own\napartment. This walk was part of a regular routine of physical exercise\nthat kept his body hard and resilient in spite of long hours spent in\nthe laboratory. As he opened the door of his apartment he heard the\nwater running into his bath. Perfect timing. He was making that walk\nin precisely seven minutes, four and four-fifths seconds. He undressed\nand climbed into the tub, relaxing luxuriously in the exhilaration of\nirradiated water.\n\nHe let all the problems of his work drift away, his mind was a peaceful\nblank. Then someone was hammering on his head. He struggled reluctantly\nawake. It was the door that was being attacked, not his head. The\nbattering thunder continued persistently. He swore and sat up.\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\nThere was no answer; the hammering continued.\n\n\"All right! All right! I'm coming!\" He yelled, crawled out of the tub\nand reached for his bathrobe. It wasn't there. He swore some more and\ngrabbed a towel, wrapping it inadequately around him; it didn't quite\nmeet astern. He paddled wetly across the floor sounding like a flock of\nducks on parade.\n\nRetaining the towel with one hand he inched the door cautiously open.\n\n\"What the devil--\" He stopped abruptly at the sight of a policeman's\nuniform.\n\n\"Sorry, sir, but one of those rebels is loose in the Administration\nCenter somewhere. We're making a check-up of all the apartments.\"\n\n\"Well, you can check out; I haven't got any blasted rebels in here.\"\nThe policeman's face hardened, then relaxed knowingly.\n\n\"Oh, I see, sir. No rebels, of course. Sorry to have disturbed you.\nHave a good--Good night, sir,\" he saluted and left.\n\nBrian closed the door in puzzlement. What the devil had that flat-foot\nbeen smirking about? Well, maybe he could get his bath now.\n\n\n\nHanson turned away from the door and froze in amazement. Through the\nopen door of his bedroom he could see his bed neatly turned down as\nit should be, but the outline under the counterpane and the luxuriant\nmass of platinum-blond hair on the pillow was certainly no part of his\nregular routine.\n\n\"Hello.\" The voice matched the calm alertness of a pair of deep-blue\neyes. Brian just stared at her in numbed fascination. That was what the\npoliceman had meant with his insinuating smirk.\n\n\"Just ask for Myrtle.\" Pete Brent's joking words flashed back to him.\nNow he got it. This was probably the young fool's idea of a joke. He'd\nsoon fix that.\n\n\"All right, joke's over, you can beat it now.\"\n\n\"Joke? I don't see anything funny, unless it's you and that suggestive\ntowel. You should either abandon it or get one that goes all the way\nround.\"\n\nBrian slowly acquired a complexion suitable for painting fire plugs.\n\n\"Shut up and throw me my dressing gown.\" He gritted.\n\nThe girl swung her legs out of bed and Brian blinked; she was fully\ndressed. The snug, zippered overall suit she wore did nothing to\nconceal the fact that she was a female. He wrapped his bathrobe\nausterely around him.\n\n\"Well, now what?\" she asked and looked at him questioningly.\n\n\"Well, what do you think?\" he burst out angrily. \"I'm going to finish\nmy bath and I'd suggest you go down to the laboratory and hold hands\nwith Pete. He'd appreciate it.\" He got the impression that the girl was\nstruggling heroically to refrain from laughing and that didn't help his\ndignity any. He strode into the bathroom, slammed the door and climbed\nback into the bath.\n\nThe door opened a little.\n\n\"Well, good-by now.\" The girl said sweetly. \"Remember me to the police\nforce.\"\n\n\"Get out of here!\" he yelled and the door shut abruptly on a rippling\nburst of laughter. Damn women! It was getting so a man had to pack\na gun with him or something. And Pete Brent. He thought with grim\nsatisfaction of the unending extra work that was going to occur around\nthe laboratory from now on. He sank back into the soothing liquid\nembrace of the bath and deliberately set his mind loose to wander in\ncomplete relaxation.\n\nA hammering thunder burst on the outer door. He sat up with a groan.\n\n\"Lay off, you crazy apes!\" he yelled furiously, but the pounding\ncontinued steadily. He struggled out of the bath, wrapped his damp\nbathrobe clammily around him and marched to the door with a seething\nfury of righteous anger burning within him. He flung the door wide, his\nmouth all set for a withering barrage, but he didn't get a chance. Four\npolice constables and a sergeant swarmed into the room, shoving him\naway from the door.\n\n\"Say! What the--\"\n\n\"Where is she?\" the sergeant demanded.\n\n\"Wherethehell's who?\"\n\n\"Quit stallin', bud. You know who. That female rebel who was in here.\"\n\n\"Rebel? You're crazy! That was just ... Pete said ... rebel? Did you\nsay rebel?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I said rebel, an' where is she?\"\n\n\"She ... why ... why ... she left, of course. You don't think I was\ngoing to have women running around in here, do you?\"\n\n\"She wuz in his bed when I seen her, sarge,\" one of the guards\ncontributed. \"But she ain't there now.\"\n\n\"You don't think that I--\"\n\n\"Listen, bud, we don't do the thinkin' around here. You come on along\nand see the chief.\"\n\nBrian had had about enough. \"I'm not going anywhere to see anybody.\nMaybe you don't know who I am. You can't arrest me.\"\n\n\n\nBrian Hanson, Chief of Research for Venus Consolidated, as dignified as\npossible in a damp bathrobe, glared out through the bars at a slightly\nbewildered Pete Brent.\n\n\"What the devil do you want? Haven't you caused enough blasted trouble\nalready?\"\n\n\"Me? For gosh sakes, chief--\"\n\n\"Yes, you! If sending that damn blonde to my apartment and getting me\narrested is your idea of a joke--\"\n\n\"But, my gosh, I didn't send anybody, chief. And this is no joke.\nThat wasn't Myrtle, that was Crystal James, old man James' daughter.\nThey're about the oldest family on Venus. Police have been after her\nfor months; she's a rebel and she's sure been raising plenty of hell\naround here. She got in and blew out the main communications control\npanel last night. Communications been tied up all day.\" Pete lowered\nhis voice to an appreciative whisper, \"Gosh, chief, I didn't know you\nhad it in you. How long have you been in with that bunch? Is that girl\nas good-looking as they say she is?\"\n\n\"Now listen here, Brent. I don't know--\"\n\n\"Oh, it's all right, chief. You can trust me. I won't give you away.\"\n\n\"There's nothing to give away, you fool!\" Brian bellowed. \"I don't know\nanything about any damn rebels. All I want is to get out of here--\"\n\n\"Gotcha, chief,\" Brent whispered understandingly. \"I'll see if I can\npass the word along.\"\n\n\"Come here, you idiot!\" Brian screamed after his erstwhile assistant.\n\n\"Pipe down there, bud,\" a guard's voice cut in chillingly.\n\nBrian retired to his cell bunk and clutched his aching head in\nfrustrated fury.\n\nFor the nineteenth time Brian Hanson strode to the door of his cell and\nrattled the bars.\n\n\"Listen here, guard, you've got to take a message to McHague. You can't\nhold me here indefinitely.\"\n\n\"Shut up. Nobody ain't takin' no message to McHague. I don't care if\nyou are--\"\n\nBrian's eyes almost popped out as he saw a gloved hand reach around\nthe guard's neck and jam a rag over his nose and mouth. Swift shadows\nmoved expertly before his astonished gaze. Another guard was caught and\nsilenced as he came around the end of the corridor. Someone was outside\nhis cell door, a hooded figure which seemed, somehow, familiar.\n\n\"Hello, pantless!\" a voice breathed.\n\nHe knew that voice!\n\n\"What the devil are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Somebody by the name of Pete Brent tipped us off that you were in\ntrouble because of me. But don't worry, we're going to get you out.\"\n\n\"Damn that fool kid! Leave me alone. I don't want to get out of here\nthat way!\" he yelled wildly. \"Guards! Help!\"\n\n\"Shut up! Do you want to get us shot?\"\n\n\"Sure I do. Guards! Guards!\"\n\nSomeone came running.\n\n\"Guards are coming,\" a voice warned.\n\nHe could hear the girl struggling with the lock.\n\n\"Damn,\" she swore viciously. \"This is the wrong key! Your goose is sure\ncooked now. Whether you like it or not, you'll hang with us when they\nfind us trying to get you out of here.\"\n\nBrian felt as though something had kicked him in the stomach. She was\nright! He had to get out now. He wouldn't be able to explain this away.\n\n\"Give me that key,\" he hissed and grabbed for it.\n\nHe snapped two of the coigns off in the lock and went to work with the\nrest of the key. He had designed these escape-proof locks himself. In a\nfew seconds the door swung open and they were fleeing silently down the\njail corridor.\n\nThe girl paused doubtfully at a crossing passage.\n\n\"This way,\" he snarled and took the lead. He knew the ground plan of\nthis jail perfectly. He had a moment of wonder at the crazy spectacle\nof himself, the fair-haired boy of Venus Consolidated, in his flapping\nbathrobe, leading a band of escaping rebels out of the company's best\njail.\n\nThey burst around a corner onto a startled guard.\n\n\"They're just ahead of us,\" Brian yelled. \"Come on!\"\n\n\"Right with you,\" the guard snapped and ran a few steps with them\nbefore a blackjack caught up with him and he folded into a corner.\n\n\"Down this way, it's a short cut.\" Brian led the way to a heavily\nbarred side door.\n\nThe electric eye tripped a screaming alarm, but the broken key in\nBrian's hands opened the complicated lock in a matter of seconds. They\nwere outside the jail on a side street, the door closed and the lock\njammed immovably behind them.\n\nSirens wailed. The alarm was out! The street suddenly burst into\nbrilliance as the floodlights snapped on. Brian faltered to a stop and\nCrystal James pushed past him.\n\n\"We've got reinforcements down here,\" she said, then skidded to a halt.\nTwo guards barred the street ahead of them.\n\nBrian felt as though his stomach had fallen down around his ankles\nand was tying his feet up. He couldn't move. The door was jammed shut\nbehind them, they'd have to surrender and there'd be no explaining\nthis break. He started mentally cursing Pete Brent, when a projector\nbeam slashed viciously by him. These guards weren't fooling! He heard\na gasping grunt of pain as one of the rebels went down. They were\nshooting to kill.\n\nHe saw a sudden, convulsive movement from the girl. A black object\ncurved out against the lights. The sharp, ripping blast of an atomite\nbomb thundered along the street and slammed them to the ground. The\nglare left them blinded. He struggled to his feet. The guards had\nvanished, a shallow crater yawned in the road where they had been.\n\n\"We've got to run!\" the girl shouted.\n\nHe started after her. Two surface transport vehicles waited around the\ncorner. Brian and the rebels bundled into them and took away with a\nroar. The chase wasn't organized yet, and they soon lost themselves in\nthe orderly rush of Venus City traffic.\n\n\n\nThe two carloads of rebels cruised nonchalantly past the Administration\nCenter and pulled into a private garage a little beyond.\n\n\"What are we stopping here for?\" Brian demanded. \"We've got to get\naway.\"\n\n\"That's just what we're doing,\" Crystal snapped. \"Everybody out.\"\n\nThe rebels piled out and the cars pulled away to become innocuous parts\nof the traffic stream. The rebels seemed to know where they were going\nand that gave them the edge on Brian. They followed Crystal down into\nthe garage's repair pit.\n\nShe fumbled in the darkness a moment, then a darker patch showed as\na door swung open in the side of the pit. They filed into the solid\nblackness after her and the door thudded shut. The beam of a torch\nstabbed through the darkness and they clambered precariously down a\nsteep, steel stairway.\n\n\"Where the dickens are we?\" Brian whispered hoarsely.\n\n\"Oh, you don't have to whisper, we're safe enough here. This is one of\nthe air shafts leading down to the old mines.\"\n\n\"Old mines? What old mines?\"\n\n\"That's something you newcomers don't know anything about. This whole\narea was worked out long before Venus Consolidated came to the planet.\nThese old tunnels run all under the city.\"\n\nThey went five hundred feet down the air shaft before they reached a\nlevel tunnel.\n\n\"What do we do? Hide here?\"\n\n\"I should say not. Serono Zeburzac, head of McHague's secret police\nwill be after us now. We won't be safe anywhere near Venus City.\"\n\n\"Don't be crazy. That Serono Zeburzac stuff is just a legend McHague\nkeeps up to scare people with.\"\n\n\"That's what you think,\" Crystal snapped. \"McHague's legend got my\nfather and he'll get all of us unless we run the whole company right\noff the planet.\"\n\n\"Well, what the dickens does he look like?\" Brian asked doubtfully.\n\n\"I don't know, but his left hand is missing. Dad did some good shooting\nbefore he died,\" she said grimly.\n\nBrian was startled at the icy hardness of her voice.\n\nTwo of the rebels pulled a screening tarpaulin aside and revealed\none of the old-type ore cars that must have been used in the ancient\nmines. A brand-new atomic motor gleamed incongruously at one end. The\nrebels crowded into it and they went rumbling swiftly down the echoing\npassage. The lights of the car showed the old working, rotten and\ncrumbling, fallen in in some places and signs of new work where the\nrebels had cleared away the debris of years.\n\nBrian struggled into a zippered overall suit as they followed a\ntwisting, tortuous course for half an hour, switching from one tunnel\nto another repeatedly until he had lost all conception of direction.\nCrystal James, at the controls, seemed to know exactly where they were\ngoing.\n\nThe tunnel emerged in a huge cavern that gloomed darkly away in every\ndirection. The towering, massive remains of old machinery, eroded and\nrotten with age crouched like ancient, watching skeletons.\n\n\"These were the old stamp mills,\" the girl said, and her voice seemed\nto be swallowed to a whisper in the vast, echoing darkness.\n\nBetween two rows of sentinel ruins they came suddenly on two slim\nVenusian atmospheric ships. Dim light spilled over them from a ragged\ngash in the wall of the cavern. Brian followed Crystal into the smaller\nof the two ships and the rest of the rebels manned the other.\n\n\"Wait a minute, how do we get out of here?\" Brian demanded.\n\n\"Through that hole up there,\" the girl said matter-of-factly.\n\n\"You're crazy, you can't get through there.\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah? Just watch this.\" The ship thundered to life beneath them\nand leaped off in a full-throttled take-off.\n\n\"We're going to crash! That gap isn't wide enough!\"\n\nThe sides of the gap rushed in on the tips of the stubby wings. Brian\nbraced himself for the crash, but it didn't come. At the last possible\nsecond, the ship rolled smoothly over. At the moment it flashed through\nthe opening it was stood vertically on edge.\n\n\n\nCrystal held the ship in its roll and completed the maneuver outside\nthe mountain while Brian struggled to get his internal economy back\ninto some semblance of order.\n\n\"That's some flying,\" he said as soon as he could speak.\n\nCrystal looked at him in surprise. \"That's nothing. We Venusians fly\nalmost as soon as we can walk.\"\n\n\"Oh--I see,\" Brian said weakly and a few moments later he really did\nsee. Two big, fast, green ships, carrying the insignia of the Venus\nConsolidated police, cruised suddenly out from a mountain air station.\n\nAn a\u00c3\u00abrial torpedo exploded in front of the rebel ship. Crystal's face\nset in grim lines as she pulled the ship up in a screaming climb. Brian\ngot up off the floor.\n\n\"You don't have to get excited like that,\" he complained. \"They weren't\ntrying to hit us.\"\n\n\"That's what you think,\" Crystal muttered. \"Those children don't play\nfor peanuts.\"\n\n\"But, girl, they're just Venus Consolidated police. They haven't got\nany authority to shoot anyone.\"\n\n\"Authority doesn't make much difference to them,\" Crystal snapped\nbitterly. \"They've been killing people all over the planet. What do you\nthink this revolution is about?\"\n\n\"You must be mistak--\" He slumped to the floor as Crystal threw the\nship into a mad, rolling spin. A tremendous crash thundered close\nastern.\n\n\"I guess that was a mistake!\" Crystal yelled as she fought the controls.\n\nBrian almost got to his feet when another wild maneuver hurled him back\nto the floor. The police ship was right on their tail. The girl gunned\nher craft into a snap Immelmann and swept back on their pursuers,\nslicing in close over the ship. Brian's eyes bulged as he saw a long\nstreak of paint and metal ripped off the wing of the police ship. He\nsaw the crew battling their controls in startled terror. The ship\nslipped frantically away and fell into a spin.\n\n\"That's them,\" Crystal said with satisfaction. \"How are the others\ndoing?\"\n\n\"Look! They're hit!\" Brian felt sick.\n\nThe slower rebel freight ship staggered drunkenly as a torpedo caught\nit and ripped away half a wing. It plunged down in flames with the\nwhite flowers of half a dozen parachutes blossoming around it. Brian\nwatched in horror as the police ship came deliberately about. They\nheard its forward guns go into action. The bodies of the parachutists\njerked and jumped like crazy marionettes as the bullets smashed into\nthem. It was over in a few moments. The dead rebels drifted down into\nthe mist-shrouded depths of the valley.\n\n\"The dirty, murdering rats!\" Brian's voice ripped out in a fury of\noutrage. \"They didn't have a chance!\"\n\n\"Don't get excited,\" Crystal told him in a dead, flat voice. \"That's\njust normal practice. If you'd stuck your nose out of your laboratory\nonce in a while, you'd have heard of these things.\"\n\n\"But why--\" He ducked away instinctively as a flight of bullets spanged\nthrough the fuselage. \"They're after us now!\"\n\nCrystal's answer was to yank the ship into a rocketing climb. The\npolice were watching for that. The big ship roared up after them.\n\n\"Just follow along, suckers,\" Crystal invited grimly.\n\nShe snapped the ship into a whip stall. For one nauseating moment they\nhung on nothing, then the ship fell over on its back and they screamed\ndown in a terminal velocity dive, heading for the safety of the lower\nvalley mists. The heavier police ship, with its higher wing-loading,\ncould not match the maneuver. The rebel craft plunged down through the\nblinding fog. Half-seen, ghostly fingers of stone clutched up at them,\ntalons of gray rock missed and fell away again as Crystal nursed the\nship out of its dive.\n\n\"_Phew!_\" Brian gasped. \"Well, we got away that time. How in thunder\ncan you do it?\"\n\n\"Well, you don't do it on faith. Take a look at that fuel gauge! We\nmay get as far as our headquarters--or we may not.\"\n\n\n\nFor twenty long minutes they groped blindly through the fog, flying\nsolely by instruments and dead reckoning. The needle of the fuel gauge\nflickered closer and closer to the danger point. They tore loose from\nthe clinging fog as it swung firmly to \"Empty.\" The drive sputtered and\ncoughed and died.\n\n\"That's figuring it nice and close,\" Crystal said in satisfaction. \"We\ncan glide in from here.\"\n\n\"Into where?\" Brian demanded. All he could see immediately ahead was\nthe huge bulk of a mountain which blocked the entire width of the\nvalley and soared sheer up to the high-cloud level. His eyes followed\nit up and up--\n\n\"Look! Police ships. They've seen us!\"\n\n\"Maybe they haven't. Anyway, there's only one place we can land.\"\n\nThe ship lunged straight for the mountain wall!\n\n\"Are you crazy? Watch out--we'll crash!\"\n\n\"You leave the flying to me,\" Crystal snapped.\n\nShe held the ship in its glide, aiming directly for the tangled foliage\nof the mountain face. Brian yelped and cowered instinctively back. The\nlush green of the mountainside swirled up to meet them. They ripped\nthrough the foliage--there was no crash. They burst through into a\nhuge, brilliantly lighted cavern and settled to a perfect landing. Men\ncame running. Crystal tumbled out of her ship.\n\n\"Douse those lights,\" she shouted. \"The police are outside.\"\n\nA tall, lean man with bulbous eyes and a face like a startled horse,\nrushed up to Crystal.\n\n\"What do you mean by leading them here?\" he yelled, waving his hands.\n\n\"They jumped us when we had no fuel, and quit acting like an idiot.\"\n\nThe man was shaking, his eyes looked wild. \"They'll kill us. We've got\nto get out of here.\"\n\n\"Wait, you fool. They may not even have seen us.\" But he was gone,\nrunning toward a group of ships lined up at the end of the cavern.\n\n\"Who was that crazy coot and what is this place?\" Brian demanded.\n\n\"That was Gort Sterling, our leader,\" the girl said bitterly. \"And\nthis is our headquarters.\" One of the ships at the back of the cavern\nthundered to life, streaked across the floor and burst out through the\nopening Crystal's ship had left. \"He hasn't got a chance! We'll be\nspotted for sure, now.\"\n\nThe other rebels waited uncertainly, but not for long. There was the\ncrescendoing roar of ships in a dive followed by the terrific crash of\nan explosion.\n\n\"They got him!\" Crystal's voice was a moan. \"Oh, the fool, the fool!\"\n\n\"Sounded like more than one ship. They'll be after us, now. Is there\nany other way of getting out of this place?\"\n\n\"Not for ships. We'll have to walk and they'll follow us.\"\n\n\"We've got to slow them down some way, then. I wonder how the devil\nthey traced us? I thought we lost them in that fog.\"\n\n\"It's that Serono Zeburzac, the traitor. He knows these mountains as\nwell as we do.\"\n\n\"How come?\"\n\n\"The Zeburzacs are one of the old families, but he sold out to McHague.\"\n\n\"Well, what do we do now? Just stand here? It looks like everybody's\nleaving.\"\n\n\"We might as well just wait,\" Crystal said hopelessly. \"It won't do us\nany good to run out into the hills. Zeburzac and his men will follow.\"\n\n\"We could slow them down some by swinging a couple of those ships\naround so their rocket exhausts sweep the entrance to the cavern,\"\nBrian suggested doubtfully. She looked at him steadily.\n\n\"You sound like the only good rebel left. We can try it, anyway.\"\n\n\n\nThey ran two ships out into the middle of the cavern, gunned them\naround and jockeyed them into position--not a moment too soon.\n\nHalf a dozen police showed in brief silhouette as they slipped\ncautiously into the cavern, guns ready, expecting resistance. They met\na dead silence. A score or more followed them without any attempt at\nconcealment. Then Brian and Crystal cut loose with the drives of the\ntwo ships.\n\nStartled screams of agony burst from the crowded group of police as\nthey were caught in the annihilating cross fire of roaring flame.\nThey crisped and twisted, cooked to scorched horrors before they\nfell. A burst of thick, greasy smoke rushed out of the cavern. Two of\nthe police, their clothes and flesh scorched and flaming, plunged as\nshrieking, living torches down the mountainside.\n\nCrystal was white and shaking, her face set in a mask of horror, as she\nclimbed blindly from her ship.\n\n\"Let's get away! I can smell them burning,\" she shuddered and covered\nher face with her hands.\n\nBrian grabbed her and shook her.\n\n\"Snap out of it,\" he barked. \"That's no worse than shooting helpless\nmen in parachutes. We can't go, yet; we're not finished here.\"\n\n\"Oh, let them shoot us! I can't go through that again!\"\n\n\"You don't have to. Wait here.\"\n\nHe climbed back into one of the ships and cut the richness of the fuel\nmixture down till the exhaust was a lambent, shuddering stutter,\nverging on extinction. He dashed to the other ship and repeated the\nmaneuver, fussing with the throttle till he had the fuel mixture\nadjusted to critical fineness. The beat of the stuttering exhaust\nseemed to catch up to the other and built to an aching pulsation. In\na moment the whole mass of air in the cavern hit the frequency with a\nsubtle, intangible thunder of vibration.\n\nCrystal screamed. \"Brian! There's more police cutting in around the\nentrance.\"\n\nBrian clambered out of the ship and glanced at the glowing points\nin the rock where the police were cutting their way through outside\nthe line of the exhaust flames. The pulsating thunder in the cavern\ncrescendoed to an intolerable pitch. A huge mass of stalactites crashed\nto the floor.\n\n\"It's time to check out,\" Brian shouted.\n\nCrystal led the way as they fled down the escape tunnel. The roaring\ncrash of falling rock was a continuous, increasing avalanche of sound\nin the cavern behind them.\n\nThey emerged from the tunnel on the face of the mountain, several\nhundred yards to the east of the cavern entrance. The ground shook and\nheaved beneath them.\n\n\"The whole side of the mountain's sliding,\" Crystal screamed.\n\n\"Run!\" Brian shoved her and they plunged madly through the thick tangle\nof jungle away from the slide.\n\nHuge boulders leaped and smashed through the matted bush around them.\nCrystal went down as the ground slipped from under her. Brian grabbed\nher and a tree at the same time. The tree leaned and crashed down the\nslope, the whole jungle muttered and groaned and came to life as it\njoined the roaring rush of the slide. They were tumbled irresistibly\ndownward, riding the edge of the slide for terrifying minutes till\nit stilled and left them bruised and shaken in a tangle of torn\nvegetation.\n\nThe remains of two police ships, caught without warning in the rush as\nthey attempted to land, stuck up grotesquely out of the foot of the\nslide. The dust was settling away. A flock of brilliant blue, gliding\nlizards barking in raucous terror, fled down the valley. Then they were\ngone and the primeval silence settled back into place.\n\nBrian and Crystal struggled painfully to solid ground. Crystal gazed\nwith a feeling of awe at the devastated mountainside.\n\n\"How did you do it?\"\n\n\"It's a matter of harmonics,\" Brian explained. \"If you hit the right\nvibratory combination, you can shake anything down. But now that we've\nmade a mess of the old homestead, what do we do?\"\n\n\"Walk,\" Crystal said laconically. She led the way as they started\nscrambling through the jungle up the mountainside.\n\n\"Where are we heading for?\" Brian grunted as he struggled along.\n\n\"The headquarters of the Carlton family. They're the closest people we\ncan depend on. They've kept out of the rebellion, but they're on our\nside. They've helped us before.\"\n\n\n\nTwo days later, Crystal and Brian, weary, bedraggled and bushworn,\nstumbled on a rocky trail that twisted up through a narrow valley\ntoward the Carlton place. Trails were scarce in the terrific Venusian\nmountain country where nearly all communication was by air.\n\nCrystal knew this path.\n\n\"We're almost there,\" she said, and they pushed along faster.\n\n\"Listen! What's that?\" Brian stopped and they both heard the sound of\naircraft taking off. The pulsing roar of the rocket drives approached\nand a V formation of five ships swept by overhead.\n\nCrystal looked at Brian with dawning horror behind her eyes. \"Police!\"\n\n\"Good. They're just leaving; they were probably just checking up on the\nCarltons.\"\n\nCrystal shivered. \"When Serono Zeburzac checks up on someone, there\nusually isn't much left. Come on.\" She started at a run down the trail.\n\nThey slowed at the sight of a clearing ahead. A faint sound reached\nthem, a sobbing, inarticulate moan of unexpressible agony that froze\nthem in their tracks.\n\n\"What's that?\" Brian gasped.\n\nCrystal's face was dead-white as they moved cautiously forward.\nThey stared out into the clearing in dumb horror. The huge, rambling\nCarlton mansion was a smoking heap of ruins. A giant Venus thorn bush\nin front of the house was scorched and charred by the flames. One of\nits murderous, yard-long spikes carried a terribly gruesome burden.\nCrystal whimpered and stumbled forward before Brian could stop her. She\ncollapsed in a sobbing heap in front of the gray-haired man impaled on\nthe giant thorn. The figure stirred feebly.\n\n\"He's alive,\" Brian muttered. \"Crystal! Snap out of it. Get up and give\nme a hand. We'll cut him down.\"\n\nWith Crystal's help Brian hacked off the thorn and gently eased the\nfrail, old man to the ground. His breath fluttered out between lips\nflecked with pink-tinged froth. His eyes tried to smile his thanks\nthrough their haze of pain.\n\nCrystal held the weakly gripping hands. \"Who did this to you?\"\n\nThe gray lips moved and worked, struggling painfully to form words. The\nwhisper was almost inaudible:\n\n\"Serono ... Zeburzac.\"\n\nCrystal's face hardened to a mask of vicious cruelty as she fought her\nemotions down.\n\n\"We'll get him.\"\n\n\"No.\" The elder Carlton seemed to gather strength. \"Get away--escape.\"\n\nCrystal gripped his hands and seemed to hold him back from the edge of\nEternity by sheer strength of will.\n\n\"Where? Where can we go?\"\n\nThe eyes fluttered open again, the shadow of death lurked in their\ndepths. \"Go ... the place where the Five Valleys meet ... beware ...\nZeburzac.\"\n\nHis breath drifted out in an effortless sigh. The tortured body was\nstill. Crystal rose unsteadily to her feet. She turned blindly and\nBrian took her in his arms, trying to comfort her as her wild sobbing\ngot out of control. He patted her shoulder awkwardly.\n\n\"Take it easy, kid,\" he muttered helplessly. His laboratory experience\nhadn't covered any such contingency as this.\n\n\"Brian, take me away. I can't stand this. Hide me somewhere before that\nfiend comes back.\"\n\n\"I thought we were part of a revolution that was going to clean them\noff the planet,\" Brian reminded her grimly.\n\n\"We can't fight this. We haven't got a chance. Zeburzac has everything.\"\n\n\"He hasn't got us yet. Where's this Five Valleys place? Can we get\nthere?\"\n\n\"Yes, but it will be no use. I want to quit now.\"\n\nBrian's arms tightened around her. His voice was bleak and cold. \"I'm\nnot quitting. I'm going to get Serono Zeburzac.\"\n\nThe girl in his arms was still for a moment. Then she let go a long,\ntrembling sigh of weary resignation.\n\n\"All right, I'm with you. Let's start traveling.\"\n\n\n\n\"The place where Five Valleys meet.\" Crystal waved her arm out toward\nthe tremendous green bowl of emptiness that curved away all round them.\n\nThe sides of the gigantic cup had been cracked and split by some\ncataclysmic upheaval in the turbulent youth of the young planet. They\nstood at the mouth of one of the sheer, ragged slashes that had given\nthe place its name. The other four were streaks of darker green against\nthe distant walls. Beneath the eternal-night cloud level the air was\nclear.\n\nDirectly across from them a tremendous, sharp-prowed promontory\nsheered up from the depths. Capping it, against the somber green of\nthe valley walls, the snow-white structure of a dream palace rose\nin airy splendor. In the dark setting, the walls were radiant with\nbreath-taking beauty, so perfect in balance and line that it concealed\nthe huge massiveness of the buildings, postponed for a moment the\nrealization that the great structure was a glorious ruin.\n\nBrian let his breath go. \"I didn't know there was anything like that on\nVenus,\" he said in open admiration. \"Who built it?\"\n\n\"The Martins. They used to operate the mines in this district, but they\nwere worked out years ago and the family scattered. They still own this\nplace. Nobody lives in it officially, but there must be some help here\nor Grenville Carlton wouldn't have told us to come. Maybe the rebels\nare using the old hangars.\"\n\n\"Well, there's only one way to find out. We gotta climb.\"\n\n\n\n\"There's somebody here, all right,\" Brian said as they entered the\ngreat courtyard through a ruined gateway. \"Look, there's a couple of\nships over there.\"\n\n\"And they're our people, too.\" There was a lilt in Crystal's voice.\n\"That far ship is Jimmy Thornton's--I'd know it anywhere.\" They\napproached the huge main doors of the great, white mansion.\n\nOne door swung partly open and a swarthy, powerful man stepped hastily\nout. He carried an atomic projector.\n\n\"Halt!\" he commanded. \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Oh, you don't need to get excited, we're rebels, too,\" Crystal told\nhim. \"Who's here?\"\n\n\"Who is it, Max?\" a pleasant voice inquired from the dim hallway.\n\n\"Two more of the rebels, sir,\" the guard replied woodenly.\n\n\"Oh--rebels? Oh, yes, of course. Show them in, Max.\" The guard stood\nrespectfully aside as Crystal and Brian entered the huge, echoing\nchamber.\n\n\"To your right,\" the guard directed and they entered a small, exquisite\nroom. The man behind the desk seemed to fit perfectly into this\ncultured setting, he was small and neat, silver hair frosted his\ntemples, framing gentle, delicate features. He smiled with pleasant,\ndisarming frankness as he rose to greet them.\n\n\"You'll have to excuse Max, we didn't know you were coming, of course.\nJust make yourselves at home. Young Jim Thornton arrived a short while\nago. You'll be able to see him presently. You'll be hungry, of course.\nMax, bring some refreshment.\"\n\n\"Have many of us arrived?\" Crystal asked anxiously.\n\n\"I'm sorry to say, very few. Just Jim Thornton and his party and you\nand Mr. Hanson.\"\n\nBrian started. \"How do you now know my name?\" he asked in surprise.\n\n\"Oh, we've all heard of you, Mr. Hanson, and how you got Miss James out\nof Venus City. Brilliant work, I must say, and the way you routed the\npolice in the caverns was truly a remarkable accomplishment. But--what\nmade you come to this place? We've not been established here long.\"\n\n\"Grenville Carlton told us about it,\" Crystal said briefly.\n\n\"Carlton? Old Grenville. How is he?\"\n\n\"He's dead.\" Crystal's face hardened to a white mask of hatred at the\nmemory. \"We found him impaled on a thorn bush in front of the ruins of\nhis own house.\" Her words were brutally blunt with the tremendous surge\nof emotion behind them.\n\n\"Impaled ... _tut tut tut_ ... my goodness, how terrible! Do you know\nwho could have done it?\"\n\n\"Yes. We found Carlton before he died. It was that rat Serono Zeburzac\nwho killed him.\"\n\n\"Oh--do you know what this Serono Zeburzac looks like?\"\n\n\"We've never seen him,\" Crystal cut in grimly, \"but my father did, over\nthe sights of an atomic flame projector. Serono Zeburzac has no left\nhand.\"\n\n\"Oh--\" The gray-haired man behind the desk was interrupted by a\nterrible scream of human agony.\n\n\"No ... NO--\" The words rose in a tortured frenzy. \"Oh, God!... Not\nthat again.... AAAAaaaaa--\"\n\n\n\nCrystal leaped to her feet.\n\n\"Jim--that was Jim Thornton! What's happened--\" Her eyes turned\nin startled question to the slight, calm figure behind the desk.\nHis benign expression of quiet peace had not been disturbed in the\nslightest by the soul-rending cry. He placed his fingertips precisely\ntogether.\n\n\"Are you sure Zeburzac was missing his left hand?\"--he flexed the\nfingers of his own left hand for emphasis--\"and not--his right?\" There\nwas a sickening click in the sudden, dead stillness of the room as he\ntwisted at his right hand. It came away at the wrist, the thumb dropped\nlifelessly down. The fingers of his left hand curled around it. The\nwrist of the severed member was pointed toward them. In fascinated\nhorror they stared down the muzzle of a tiny, short-range, atomic\nprojector concealed in the artificial hand.\n\nCrystal recoiled, one faltering step.\n\n\"Serono--Grenville was trying to warn us!\"\n\nBrian caught her before she fell.\n\n\"There is no cause for excitement. Sit down, please.\" The quiet\ncourtesy of Serono's voice did not alter, but the steel thread of\ncommand was subtly woven into his words. \"You have been very clever,\nHanson, too clever. I thought, almost, you had escaped me, but no one\never does. My enemies are delivered into my hands; soon there will be\nnone on Venus.\"\n\nThe moment of shock passed. Brian's superlatively keen faculties keyed\nacutely to the emergency. They needed time first.\n\n\"How do we rate as your enemies?\" he stalled.\n\n\"Mr. Hanson, we are not children. You know why you are my enemy. I\nrecognized you years ago, you are far too brilliant a man to have\nagainst me, and you would never be with me. Your loyalty to Venus\nConsolidated made you dangerous.\"\n\n\"My loyalty? What about yours? I thought you were working with McHague\nand the company.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course, as long as it suits my purpose.\"\n\n\"Suppose someone got word to the Earth Council. You wouldn't last long,\nthen.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not, but Venus Consolidated controls all communication with\nEarth and soon I will control Venus Consolidated. But I'm sure you must\nbe tired. Max will show you to your quarters.\" The guard ushered them\nout with the muzzle of a projector.\n\n\n\nThey started across the huge, ruined hall. Crystal stumbled blindly\nover a fragment of broken masonry. She sagged to her knees. The guard\nstopped abruptly.\n\n\"Don't try nothin', you guys,\" he snarled warningly.\n\n\"Quit being a fool, you idiot,\" Brian barked to cover Crystal's quick\nwhisper of instructions. \"This girl's sick. Give me a hand. You take\nher feet,\" he directed, as he lifted her shoulders. The guard hesitated\ndoubtfully; his instructions didn't cover this.\n\n\"O. K., but just don't try nothin'.\" He hung the projector on his\nbelt and bent down. One startled yelp gurgled and died in his throat\nas Crystal's feet slammed into his jaw and Brian's clenched hands\nrabbit-punched down on the back of his neck.\n\n\"That ought to hold him,\" Crystal muttered as she struggled to her feet.\n\nBrian picked up the projector. He recognized it; it was a new model,\ntwo of this type had been sent to his laboratory for testing before the\ncompany invested in them.\n\n\"Well, what are we waiting for? C'mon, we'll go shoot Serono's other\nhand off,\" Crystal suggested grimly.\n\n\"D'you think that'd stop them? Us with one projector against what\nthey've got?\"\n\n\"Well, it would make it interesting for a while. You don't think we\nhave a chance of getting away from here, do you?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Brian said thoughtfully. \"But when we were testing\nthis model projector one of them kind of blew up in our face. I think\nit developed a short that converted it into the old-type regenerative\ncircuit. We never were sure about it; there wasn't enough left to\nfind out. Those old regeneratives are always dangerous, they were\nliable to heat up and explode at any time if you didn't watch them.\nIf we'd been testing the model with a full charge of fuel, I wouldn't\nbe here in this mess now.\" He slid back the inspection cover of the\nprojector's compactly complicated ignition circuit and started poking\nexperimentally at the system of tiny coils and delicate wires.\n\n\"Damn!\" He swore briefly as a white-hot spark jabbed at his fingers,\nbut he held on and the wires fused together. \"That should do it. Now\nwe're all set. Where's a hole to get out through?\"\n\n\"How do you like that one?\" Crystal suggested, indicating a ragged gap\nin the broken, ancient wall of the hall. \"That's big enough to fly\nthrough and there's two guards out there in the courtyard with nice,\nshiny, new projectors ready to make smoke out of us. Want to go and\ninterview them?\"\n\n\"No. If we make enough noise here, they'll come and see us,\" Brian\nmuttered as he closed the firing switch of the projector. There was\nno stab of flame from the muzzle. He heaved the weapon back into\nthe middle of the hall. \"As soon as that warms up there should be\nconsiderable distraction taking place in here.\"\n\n\"Why? What's going to happen?\" Crystal asked.\n\n\"C'mon. Get over by the wall and be ready to run.\"\n\nThey started for the gap in the wall. A dull, heavy rumble got under\nway behind them. It built to a terrific, thundering crash as the\nuniverse split in a sheet of roaring flame. They were lifted and hurled\nbodily outward. They sprawled in a tangled heap on the pavement. Brian\nstruggled to his feet in a choking swirl of dust and yanked Crystal\nwith him. The progressive explosion of the projector's fuel battered\nthe ancient structure, the wall bulged and cracked. The startled guards\ngawped stupidly at the two figures that had erupted so violently.\n\nMasonry crashed to the pavement. The guards climbed over each other\nin a mad scramble to escape. Crystal and Brian staggered groggily\nafter them, heading for Jim Thornton's ship. Brian boosted Crystal in,\nscrambled after her and slammed the hatch shut. The drive spluttered\nand roared to life, the ship ripped crazily into the air.\n\n\n\nArnold McHague, Director in Chief of Venus Consolidated, swung his\nheavy body around in fearful expectancy. Just a faint snick as though\na lock had sprung, but there was no door on that wall. A panel slipped\nnoiselessly aside.\n\n\"Serono--\" The half-voiced question hung on a note of fear.\n\n\"No, it's not Serono, McHague.\" A tall, ragged figure, followed by a\nsmaller one, stepped from the opening.\n\n\"Hanson!\" A surge of relief sounded in McHague's voice, then died\nout. Brian Hanson was a rebel. He fumbled vaguely for the panel of\ncall buttons on his desk, but his hand froze as he saw the projector\ntrained on his expansive middle.\n\n\"I couldn't miss your stomach from here,\" Brian told him softly.\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n\"I want to get to Earth and I want your private getaway ship.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about any ship.\"\n\n\"It's no good, McHague. The drive tests for that ship were run in my\nlaboratory.\"\n\n\"There's no fuel on board. It's in no condition to fly,\" McHague said\nhopelessly.\n\n\"It had better be ready to take off. Serono doesn't trust you any more\nthan you trust him. About your only chance of living is for me to get\nto Earth and bring enough of the Planetary Patrol to head Serono off.\"\n\n\"I can't help you. I'm in this with Zeburzac. If the police get him,\nthey've got me.\"\n\n\"You can be on our side. The way I'll tell it on Earth you were just\nstringing Serono along till I could get clear.\"\n\nMcHague shook his head. \"I wouldn't live for a day if I helped you. You\ndon't know Zeburzac. His family ran Venus in the old days. He means to\nrestore that rule with himself as absolute dictator. I wouldn't be safe\neven on Earth.\"\n\n\"You'll just have to take that chance.\"\n\n\"We're wasting time,\" Crystal cut in sharply anxious. \"Come on.\"\n\nHer words brought McHague reluctantly to his feet. \"I'll do it,\" he\nmuttered thickly. \"Come with me.\"\n\n\n\nThe misty gloom of a Venusian night shrouded the jungle as three\nfigures forced their way along an almost completely overgrown trail.\nThe lights of Venus City gleamed dimly through the night murk behind\nthem. McHague stumbled and swore in the lead as the trail twisted down\nthe steepness of the ridge. He came to a halt on a long, level bench.\n\n\"This is the place.\"\n\n\"I don't see anything,\" Crystal said doubtfully.\n\n\"You didn't think I was going to leave the ship where Zeburzac could\nfind it, did you?\"\n\nMcHague scrabbled around in the roots of a bush, found what he wanted,\na metal lever hardly distinguishable in the tangle, and yanked it up.\nHis action was followed by a slight vibration underfoot, a heavy, dull\nripping of roots sounded in front of them as the ground parted before\ntheir eyes. Two balanced sections tilted upward, away from each other,\nrevealing the Stygian blackness of a pit.\n\n\"It's a ventilating shaft of one of the old mines. The ship's down\nthere about two hundred feet. It's got a Nordenfeldt control panel. Can\nyou handle it?\"\n\n\"Sure, but how can I get down?\"\n\n\"There's a ladder--but wait a minute, Hanson.\" McHague's heavy-jowled\nface was ghastly in the dim light. \"You've got to play this straight,\nsee. I'm giving you a chance and you've got to stand by me. If Serono\nknew I was doing this--You've got to get those police here--\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" Brian told him grimly. \"Serono is no friend of mine,\neither. Where's this ladder?\"\n\n\"Just over the edge on this side.\"\n\nCrystal laid her hand on Brian's arm.\n\n\"Good luck.\" She started to smile encouragingly, but she couldn't quite\nmake it. \"Brian--\" Her voice choked up. \"Oh, Brian, be careful--\" It\nwas almost a sob. Then she was in his arms. He held her for a moment\nand buried his face in the soft, silver glory of her hair.\n\n\"I'll be all right. You take care of yourself till I get back. I won't\nbe long, then we'll get this mess cleaned up.\"\n\nHe disengaged himself gently. Crystal watched in silence as Brian\nclambered over the edge and disappeared into the blackness of the\nshaft. Minutes dragged slowly by.\n\n\"Oh, I hope he makes it,\" Crystal murmured.\n\n\"He probably will. Mr. Hanson is a very resourceful man.\"\n\nThe soft, quiet voice was just behind her. Crystal turned in slow,\nhopeless terror.\n\n\"Serono--\"\n\nMcHague's breath sucked in in a startled gasp of horror.\n\n\"Zeburzac!\"\n\n\"But, of course. I wanted to be here to wish Mr. Hanson _bon voyage_. I\nhope he has a pleasant flight--although it will be a short one.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" McHague whispered.\n\n\"Why, McHague, my dear friend, you didn't think I would overlook a\nsimple thing like this?\"\n\n\"You knew?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. I visited this place several times. I supposed you might be\nleaving me some time, so, of course, I made arrangements.\" The silky\nsoftness of Serono's voice, changed to a sinister rasp, \"That ship will\nbe blown apart fifty seconds after it takes off!\"\n\n\"No--\" Crystal screamed, \"Brian!\" She turned and stumbled toward the\nshaft, then staggered back as a tremendous, roaring rush of flame\nfountained madly upward behind the screaming flight of the escaping\nship. The exhaust trail towered magnificently into the night, arching\ngracefully over as the ship swung smoothly into its first acceleration\norbit.\n\n\"Brian ... Brian--\" Crystal sobbed hopelessly.\n\nThe burning streak of fire traced steadily across the sky--then\nabruptly it ended in a bursting nova of flaming incandescence. The\nlight faded slowly into the twilight darkness.\n\n\"He's gone,\" McHague whimpered.\n\nSerono laughed softly.\n\n\"Oh, don't sound so disappointed, McHague. You'll soon be with him.\"\nThe dry click of Serono's artificial hand crisped in McHague's ears.\n\n\"No... no... Serono... wait... wait a minute--\" McHague babbled. Half\nparalyzed with terror, he sidled desperately away from the hideous\nweapon in Serono's hand. \"He held a gun on me.... I had to--\" McHague's\nstumbling words trailed off as he read \"Death\" in Serono's eyes. His\nterrified scream ripped out as he turned blindly and plunged down the\nyawning blackness of the shaft.\n\nSerono's dry chuckle stirred like the rustling wings of a bat.\n\n\"And now, Crystal James--\" He turned. There was nothing but the\nimpassive stillness of the jungle; the girl was not in sight.\n\n\n\n\"--and that, gentlemen, completes my report on the present status of\nVenus. This folder contains the vital statistics for the period since\nyour last inspection. You will find there the reason for me presenting\nthis report instead of Governor McHague. He was killed, together with\nMr. Hanson, Chief of Research for Venus Consolidated, in an explosion\nduring an experiment in rocketry which Mr. Hanson was conducting.\"\n\n\"Ah, thank you, Zeburzac.\" Chief Inspector Nathan accepted the final\nfolio of the voluminous annual report on Venus. He sat with the other\nmembers of the Board of Inspection in the governor's offices as they\ncarefully sorted through the stacks of report form and record sheets.\n\"Hm-m-m--I see you have a Crystal James listed here as killed in an\naircraft accident. Was she one of the old Venusian family of James?\"\n\nSerono nodded regretfully. \"Yes, I believe she was the last of them. I\nknew them well.\"\n\n\"That is too bad,\" Inspector Nathan said softly. \"They were a fine, old\nfamily. Well, that cleans up the report, Zeburzac; everything seems to\nbe perfectly in order.\"\n\n\"Thank you, inspector.\" Of course, it was. He had spent three months\non those reports and everything had run smoothly on schedule. In a few\nmore hours this inquisitive crew of inspectors would be gone and Venus\nwould be his.\n\nThe mild gentleness of Serono's face revealed nothing of his\ndictatorial intentions as he listened to Inspector Nathan's closing\nremarks. In a moment they would be offering him the governorship,\nlegalizing the power he already possessed. With Venus in his hands to\nbe forged into a weapon, the easy-going democracy of Earth would be no\nserious obstacle. What one clever man could do--Nathan was speaking.\n\n\"There is one item here, however, that seriously affects several of\nthese reports. This Mr. Hanson--\"\n\n\"Hanson? Yes, I think I mentioned, he died. A very violent explosion.\"\n\nChief Inspector Nathan's formal politeness melted abruptly in the\nsudden fire of his rage.\n\n\"Explosion? I know all about that explosion, you blundering murderer.\nCome in here, Hanson!\"\n\n\"Hanson!\" Serono stared in shocked unbelief at the grim figure of a man\nwho should have died, but only for a moment. Then he leaned back and\nrelaxed, his fingertips met and tapped rhythmically.\n\n\"Mr. Hanson--hm-m-m--this is almost unbelievable.\"\n\n\"Next time you plant a time bomb in a ship, don't connect it through\nthe lighting circuit, it shows on the ammeter,\" Brian told him grimly.\n\"And if you want to keep people on Venus, you should watch your freight\nships more closely.\"\n\n\"Oh, I wasn't as careless as you might think. That trap was set for\nMcHague. I would have made other arrangements if I had known you were\nto be present. As it was I thought I had got you. However, I can\nremedy that slight omission almost immediately.\"\n\nSerono twisted abruptly to his feet. His right hand snatched at his\nleft. The spluttering crackle of a projector flame lashed out. Serono\nscreamed as he dropped the red-hot wreckage of his artificial hand.\n\n\"We'd been told about that, too, and I can still shoot,\" Inspector\nNathan growled.\n\nSerono stared stupidly at the empty socket on his left arm. His face\ngrayed lividly. He staggered against the desk, threw out his hand for\nsupport and vanished. There was a moment of stunned silence in the room.\n\n\n\n\"It's a trapdoor!\" Brian yelled and leaped for the opening. He caught\na glimpse of a descending chute as the section of floor swung solidly\nback into place.\n\n\"Where does that lead to?\" Nathan barked.\n\nBrian didn't answer; he was already on his way. Nathan and the rest of\nthe Board of Inspectors pounded along behind him. They thudded down two\nflights of stairs.\n\n\"There he goes!\" The pack of inspectors let out a howl and raced down\nthe corridor behind Brian.\n\nZeburzac, racing for his life, started to draw away from them. They saw\nhim stop. There were men in the corridor ahead of him, half a dozen of\nthem. They were on him!\n\nSerono screamed terribly, once, as a swinging knife ripped him open.\nHe was slammed to the floor, his head beaten in by the vicious blows\nof his assailants. One of them lunged viciously at the prostrate form.\nBrian felt sick as he saw the crushed and bloody form of Zeburzac\nstabbed through the middle with the yard-long spike of a giant Venusian\nthorn bush.\n\nHaving finished their business the killers calmly faced the projectors\nin the hands of Inspector Nathan and his crew.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Nathan demanded.\n\n\"My name's Carlton. We're rebels. You better hurry up and shoot, it'll\nsave you trouble.\"\n\n\"These men are all right,\" Brian defended hastily. \"Serono murdered\nsome of the Carltons.\"\n\nNathan grunted. \"Well, thanks, boys. You saved us a job.\" He slipped\nhis atomic projector back into its holster. \"We're inspectors from\nEarth. We'll have to arrest you for murder, but I guess it's up to\nGovernor Hanson here to decide what to do with you.\"\n\n\"Governor?\"\n\n\"Yeah. That was decided before we left Earth. Where was Zeburzac\nheading? Where does this corridor lead to?\"\n\n\"To his apartments. Maybe he had something there. I'll go and see.\"\nBrian started down the corridor.\n\nGovernor! Governor of this young, green frontier planet. There should\nhave been a thrill in it somewhere but he felt as though he had come\nto the end of a pointless journey. He opened the door of Serono's\napartment and stepped inside.\n\nThere was no one in the luxurious room. Brian's scalp tingled; he\nfelt that he was not alone. He shuddered as he remembered Serono's\nghastly death, then stepped quickly to the bedroom door. He opened\nit cautiously, then moved in and shut it noiselessly behind him. He\nstiffened as something prodded him in the middle of his spine.\n\n\"Don't move!\" The voice was thin and vicious with hate. It stopped\nincredulously--\"Brian!\"\n\nHe swung around in amazement, and in synchronism as perfect as a\ntrained chorus, he and Crystal James cried: \"You! I thought you were\ndead!\"\n\nTheir next moves were in perfect synchronism, too.",
