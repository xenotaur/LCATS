Jerome\n\nCopyright, 1908, By Dodd, Mead & Company\n\nPublished, September, 1908\n\n\n\n\nThe neighbourhood of Bloomsbury Square towards four o\u2019clock of a\nNovember afternoon is not so crowded as to secure to the stranger, of\nappearance anything out of the common, immunity from observation. Tibb\u2019s\nboy, screaming at the top of his voice that _she_ was his honey, stopped\nsuddenly, stepped backwards on to the toes of a voluble young lady\nwheeling a perambulator, and remained deaf, apparently, to the somewhat\npersonal remarks of the voluble young lady. Not until he had reached\nthe next corner--and then more as a soliloquy than as information to the\nstreet--did Tibb\u2019s boy recover sufficient interest in his own affairs to\nremark that _he_ was her bee. The voluble young lady herself, following\nsome half-a-dozen yards behind, forgot her wrongs in contemplation\nof the stranger\u2019s back. There was this that was peculiar about the\nstranger\u2019s back: that instead of being flat it presented a decided\ncurve. \u201cIt ain\u2019t a \u2018ump, and it don\u2019t look like kervitcher of the\nspine,\u201d observed the voluble young lady to herself. \u201cBlimy if I don\u2019t\nbelieve \u2018e\u2019s taking \u2018ome \u2018is washing up his back.\u201d\n\nThe constable at the corner, trying to seem busy doing nothing, noticed\nthe stranger\u2019s approach with gathering interest. \u201cThat\u2019s an odd sort of\na walk of yours, young man,\u201d thought the constable. \u201cYou take care you\ndon\u2019t fall down and tumble over yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThought he was a young man,\u201d murmured the constable, the stranger\nhaving passed him. \u201cHe had a young face right enough.\u201d\n\nThe daylight was fading. The stranger, finding it impossible to read the\nname of the street upon the corner house, turned back.\n\n\u201cWhy, \u2018tis a young man,\u201d the constable told himself; \u201ca mere boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d said the stranger; \u201cbut would you mind telling me\nmy way to Bloomsbury Square.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is Bloomsbury Square,\u201d explained the constable; \u201cleastways round\nthe corner is. What number might you be wanting?\u201d\n\nThe stranger took from the ticket pocket of his tightly buttoned\novercoat a piece of paper, unfolded it and read it out: \u201cMrs.\nPennycherry. Number Forty-eight.\u201d\n\n\u201cRound to the left,\u201d instructed him the constable; \u201cfourth house. Been\nrecommended there?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy--by a friend,\u201d replied the stranger. \u201cThank you very much.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d muttered the constable to himself; \u201cguess you won\u2019t be calling him\nthat by the end of the week, young--\u201d\n\n\u201cFunny,\u201d added the constable, gazing after the retreating figure of the\nstranger. \u201cSeen plenty of the other sex as looked young behind and old\nin front. This cove looks young in front and old behind. Guess he\u2019ll\nlook old all round if he stops long at mother Pennycherry\u2019s: stingy old\ncat.\u201d\n\nConstables whose beat included Bloomsbury Square had their reasons for\nnot liking Mrs. Pennycherry. Indeed it might have been difficult to\ndiscover any human being with reasons for liking that sharp-featured\nlady. Maybe the keeping of second-rate boarding houses in the\nneighbourhood of Bloomsbury does not tend to develop the virtues of\ngenerosity and amiability.\n\nMeanwhile the stranger, proceeding upon his way, had rung the bell of\nNumber Forty-eight. Mrs. Pennycherry, peeping from the area and catching\na glimpse, above the railings, of a handsome if somewhat effeminate\nmasculine face, hastened to readjust her widow\u2019s cap before the\nlooking-glass while directing Mary Jane to show the stranger, should he\nprove a problematical boarder, into the dining-room, and to light the\ngas.\n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t stop gossiping, and don\u2019t you take it upon yourself to answer\nquestions. Say I\u2019ll be up in a minute,\u201d were Mrs. Pennycherry\u2019s further\ninstructions, \u201cand mind you hide your hands as much as you can.\u201d\n\n***\n\n\u201cWhat are you grinning at?\u201d demanded Mrs. Pennycherry, a couple of\nminutes later, of the dingy Mary Jane.\n\n\u201cWasn\u2019t grinning,\u201d explained the meek Mary Jane, \u201cwas only smiling to\nmyself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat at?\u201d\n\n\u201cDunno,\u201d admitted Mary Jane. But still she went on smiling.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he like then?\u201d demanded Mrs. Pennycherry.\n\n\u201c\u2018E ain\u2019t the usual sort,\u201d was Mary Jane\u2019s opinion.\n\n\u201cThank God for that,\u201d ejaculated Mrs. Pennycherry piously.\n\n\u201cSays \u2018e\u2019s been recommended, by a friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy whom?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy a friend. \u2018E didn\u2019t say no name.\u201d\n\nMrs. Pennycherry pondered. \u201cHe\u2019s not the funny sort, is he?\u201d\n\nNot that sort at all. Mary Jane was sure of it.\n\nMrs. Pennycherry ascended the stairs still pondering. As she entered the\nroom the stranger rose and bowed. Nothing could have been simpler than\nthe stranger\u2019s bow, yet there came with it to Mrs. Pennycherry a rush of\nold sensations long forgotten. For one brief moment Mrs. Pennycherry saw\nherself an amiable well-bred lady, widow of a solicitor: a visitor\nhad called to see her. It was but a momentary fancy. The next instant\nReality reasserted itself. Mrs. Pennycherry, a lodging-house keeper,\nexisting precariously upon a daily round of petty meannesses, was\nprepared for contest with a possible new boarder, who fortunately looked\nan inexperienced young gentleman.\n\n\u201cSomeone has recommended me to you,\u201d began Mrs. Pennycherry; \u201cmay I ask\nwho?\u201d\n\nBut the stranger waved the question aside as immaterial.\n\n\u201cYou might not remember--him,\u201d he smiled. \u201cHe thought that I should do\nwell to pass the few months I am given--that I have to be in London,\nhere. You can take me in?\u201d\n\nMrs. Pennycherry thought that she would be able to take the stranger in.\n\n\u201cA room to sleep in,\u201d explained the stranger, \u201c--any room will do--with\nfood and drink sufficient for a man, is all that I require.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor breakfast,\u201d began Mrs. Pennycherry, \u201cI always give--\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is right and proper, I am convinced,\u201d interrupted the stranger.\n\u201cPray do not trouble to go into detail, Mrs. Pennycherry. With whatever\nit is I shall be content.\u201d\n\nMrs. Pennycherry, puzzled, shot a quick glance at the stranger, but his\nface, though the gentle eyes were smiling, was frank and serious.\n\n\u201cAt all events you will see the room,\u201d suggested Mrs. Pennycherry,\n\u201cbefore we discuss terms.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d agreed the stranger. \u201cI am a little tired and shall be glad\nto rest there.\u201d\n\nMrs. Pennycherry led the way upward; on the landing of the third floor,\npaused a moment undecided, then opened the door of the back bedroom.\n\n\u201cIt is very comfortable,\u201d commented the stranger.\n\n\u201cFor this room,\u201d stated Mrs. Pennycherry, \u201ctogether with full board,\nconsisting of--\u201d\n\n\u201cOf everything needful. It goes without saying,\u201d again interrupted the\nstranger with his quiet grave smile.\n\n\u201cI have generally asked,\u201d continued Mrs. Pennycherry, \u201cfour pounds a\nweek. To you--\u201d Mrs. Pennycherry\u2019s voice, unknown to her, took to itself\nthe note of aggressive generosity--\u201cseeing you have been recommended\nhere, say three pounds ten.\u201d\n\n\u201cDear lady,\u201d said the stranger, \u201cthat is kind of you. As you have\ndivined, I am not a rich man. If it be not imposing upon you I accept\nyour reduction with gratitude.\u201d\n\nAgain Mrs. Pennycherry, familiar with the satirical method, shot a\nsuspicious glance upon the stranger, but not a line was there, upon\nthat smooth fair face, to which a sneer could for a moment have clung.\nClearly he was as simple as he looked.\n\n\u201cGas, of course, extra.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d agreed the Stranger.\n\n\u201cCoals--\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shall not quarrel,\u201d for a third time the stranger interrupted. \u201cYou\nhave been very considerate to me as it is. I feel, Mrs. Pennycherry, I\ncan leave myself entirely in your hands.\u201d\n\nThe stranger appeared anxious to be alone. Mrs. Pennycherry, having put\na match to the stranger\u2019s fire, turned to depart. And at this point it\nwas that Mrs. Pennycherry, the holder hitherto of an unbroken record\nfor sanity, behaved in a manner she herself, five minutes earlier in her\ncareer, would have deemed impossible--that no living soul who had ever\nknown her would have believed, even had Mrs. Pennycherry gone down upon\nher knees and sworn it to them.\n\n\u201cDid I say three pound ten?\u201d demanded Mrs. Pennycherry of the stranger,\nher hand upon the door. She spoke crossly. She was feeling cross, with\nthe stranger, with herself--particularly with herself.\n\n\u201cYou were kind enough to reduce it to that amount,\u201d replied the\nstranger; \u201cbut if upon reflection you find yourself unable--\u201d\n\n\u201cI was making a mistake,\u201d said Mrs. Pennycherry, \u201cit should have been\ntwo pound ten.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot--I will not accept such sacrifice,\u201d exclaimed the stranger;\n\u201cthe three pound ten I can well afford.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo pound ten are my terms,\u201d snapped Mrs. Pennycherry. \u201cIf you are bent\non paying more, you can go elsewhere. You\u2019ll find plenty to oblige you.\u201d\n\nHer vehemence must have impressed the stranger. \u201cWe will not contend\nfurther,\u201d he smiled. \u201cI was merely afraid that in the goodness of your\nheart--\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it isn\u2019t as good as all that,\u201d growled Mrs. Pennycherry.\n\n\u201cI am not so sure,\u201d returned the stranger. \u201cI am somewhat suspicious of\nyou. But wilful woman must, I suppose, have her way.\u201d\n\nThe stranger held out his hand, and to Mrs. Pennycherry, at that moment,\nit seemed the most natural thing in the world to take it as if it had\nbeen the hand of an old friend and to end the interview with a pleasant\nlaugh--though laughing was an exercise not often indulged in by Mrs.\nPennycherry.\n\nMary Jane was standing by the window, her hands folded in front of her,\nwhen Mrs. Pennycherry re-entered the kitchen. By standing close to\nthe window one caught a glimpse of the trees in Bloomsbury Square and\nthrough their bare branches of the sky beyond.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing much to do for the next half hour, till Cook comes\nback. I\u2019ll see to the door if you\u2019d like a run out?\u201d suggested Mrs.\nPennycherry.\n\n\u201cIt would be nice,\u201d agreed the girl so soon as she had recovered power\nof speech; \u201cit\u2019s just the time of day I like.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be longer than the half hour,\u201d added Mrs. Pennycherry.\n\nForty-eight Bloomsbury Square, assembled after dinner in the\ndrawing-room, discussed the stranger with that freedom and frankness\ncharacteristic of Forty-eight Bloomsbury Square, towards the absent.\n\n\u201cNot what I call a smart young man,\u201d was the opinion of Augustus\nLongcord, who was something in the City.\n\n\u201cThpeaking for mythelf,\u201d commented his partner Isidore, \u201chav\u2019n\u2019th any\nuthe for the thmart young man. Too many of him, ath it ith.\u201d\n\n\u201cMust be pretty smart if he\u2019s one too many for you,\u201d laughed his\npartner.\n\nThere was this to be said for the repartee of Forty-eight Bloomsbury\nSquare: it was simple of construction and easy of comprehension.\n\n\u201cWell it made me feel good just looking at him,\u201d declared Miss Kite, the\nhighly coloured. \u201cIt was his clothes, I suppose--made me think of Noah\nand the ark--all that sort of thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be clothes that would make you think--if anything,\u201d drawled\nthe languid Miss Devine. She was a tall, handsome girl, engaged at the\nmoment in futile efforts to recline with elegance and comfort combined\nupon a horsehair sofa. Miss Kite, by reason of having secured the only\neasy-chair, was unpopular that evening; so that Miss Devine\u2019s remark\nreceived from the rest of the company more approbation than perhaps it\nmerited.\n\n\u201cIs that intended to be clever, dear, or only rude?\u201d Miss Kite requested\nto be informed.\n\n\u201cBoth,\u201d claimed Miss Devine.\n\n\u201cMyself? I must confess,\u201d shouted the tall young lady\u2019s father, commonly\ncalled the Colonel, \u201cI found him a fool.\u201d\n\n\u201cI noticed you seemed to be getting on very well together,\u201d purred his\nwife, a plump, smiling little lady.\n\n\u201cPossibly we were,\u201d retorted the Colonel. \u201cFate has accustomed me to the\nsociety of fools.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it a pity to start quarrelling immediately after dinner, you\ntwo,\u201d suggested their thoughtful daughter from the sofa, \u201cyou\u2019ll have\nnothing left to amuse you for the rest of the evening.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t strike me as a conversationalist,\u201d said the lady who was\ncousin to a baronet; \u201cbut he did pass the vegetables before he helped\nhimself. A little thing like that shows breeding.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr that he didn\u2019t know you and thought maybe you\u2019d leave him half a\nspoonful,\u201d laughed Augustus the wit.\n\n\u201cWhat I can\u2019t make out about him--\u201d shouted the Colonel.\n\nThe stranger entered the room.\n\nThe Colonel, securing the evening paper, retired into a corner. The\nhighly coloured Kite, reaching down from the mantelpiece a paper fan,\nheld it coyly before her face. Miss Devine sat upright on the horse-hair\nsofa, and rearranged her skirts.\n\n\u201cKnow anything?\u201d demanded Augustus of the stranger, breaking the\nsomewhat remarkable silence.\n\nThe stranger evidently did not understand. It was necessary for\nAugustus, the witty, to advance further into that odd silence.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to pull off the Lincoln handicap? Tell me, and I\u2019ll go out\nstraight and put my shirt upon it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you would act unwisely,\u201d smiled the stranger; \u201cI am not an\nauthority upon the subject.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot! Why they told me you were Captain Spy of the _Sporting Life_--in\ndisguise.\u201d\n\nIt would have been difficult for a joke to fall more flat. Nobody\nlaughed, though why Mr. Augustus Longcord could not understand, and\nmaybe none of his audience could have told him, for at Forty-eight\nBloomsbury Square Mr. Augustus Longcord passed as a humorist. The\nstranger himself appeared unaware that he was being made fun of.\n\n\u201cYou have been misinformed,\u201d assured him the stranger.\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d said Mr. Augustus Longcord.\n\n\u201cIt is nothing,\u201d replied the stranger in his sweet low voice, and passed\non.\n\n\u201cWell what about this theatre,\u201d demanded Mr. Longcord of his friend\nand partner; \u201cdo you want to go or don\u2019t you?\u201d Mr. Longcord was feeling\nirritable.\n\n\u201cGoth the ticketh--may ath well,\u201d thought Isidore.\n\n\u201cDamn stupid piece, I\u2019m told.\u201d\n\n\u201cMotht of them thupid, more or leth. Pity to wathte the ticketh,\u201d argued\nIsidore, and the pair went out.\n\n\u201cAre you staying long in London?\u201d asked Miss Kite, raising her practised\neyes towards the stranger.\n\n\u201cNot long,\u201d answered the stranger. \u201cAt least I do not know. It depends.\u201d\n\nAn unusual quiet had invaded the drawing-room of Forty-eight Bloomsbury\nSquare, generally noisy with strident voices about this hour. The\nColonel remained engrossed in his paper. Mrs. Devine sat with her plump\nwhite hands folded on her lap, whether asleep or not it was impossible\nto say. The lady who was cousin to a baronet had shifted her chair\nbeneath the gasolier, her eyes bent on her everlasting crochet work. The\nlanguid Miss Devine had crossed to the piano, where she sat fingering\nsoftly the tuneless keys, her back to the cold barely-furnished room.\n\n\u201cSit down!\u201d commanded saucily Miss Kite, indicating with her fan the\nvacant seat beside her. \u201cTell me about yourself. You interest me.\u201d Miss\nKite adopted a pretty authoritative air towards all youthful-looking\nmembers of the opposite sex. It harmonised with the peach complexion and\nthe golden hair, and fitted her about as well.\n\n\u201cI am glad of that,\u201d answered the stranger, taking the chair suggested.\n\u201cI so wish to interest you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a very bold boy.\u201d Miss Kite lowered her fan, for the purpose of\nglancing archly over the edge of it, and for the first time encountered\nthe eyes of the stranger looking into hers. And then it was that Miss\nKite experienced precisely the same curious sensation that an hour or so\nago had troubled Mrs. Pennycherry when the stranger had first bowed to\nher. It seemed to Miss Kite that she was no longer the Miss Kite that,\nhad she risen and looked into it, the fly-blown mirror over the marble\nmantelpiece would, she knew, have presented to her view; but quite\nanother Miss Kite--a cheerful, bright-eyed lady verging on middle age,\nyet still good-looking in spite of her faded complexion and somewhat\nthin brown locks. Miss Kite felt a pang of jealousy shoot through her;\nthis middle-aged Miss Kite seemed, on the whole, a more attractive\nlady. There was a wholesomeness, a broadmindedness about her that\ninstinctively drew one towards her. Not hampered, as Miss Kite herself\nwas, by the necessity of appearing to be somewhere between eighteen and\ntwenty-two, this other Miss Kite could talk sensibly, even brilliantly:\none felt it. A thoroughly \u201cnice\u201d woman this other Miss Kite; the real\nMiss Kite, though envious, was bound to admit it. Miss Kite wished to\ngoodness she had never seen the woman. The glimpse of her had rendered\nMiss Kite dissatisfied with herself.\n\n\u201cI am not a boy,\u201d explained the stranger; \u201cand I had no intention of\nbeing bold.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d replied Miss Kite. \u201cIt was a silly remark. Whatever induced me\nto make it, I can\u2019t think. Getting foolish in my old age, I suppose.\u201d\n\nThe stranger laughed. \u201cSurely you are not old.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thirty-nine,\u201d snapped out Miss Kite. \u201cYou don\u2019t call it young?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it a beautiful age,\u201d insisted the stranger; \u201cyoung enough not\nto have lost the joy of youth, old enough to have learnt sympathy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I daresay,\u201d returned Miss Kite, \u201cany age you\u2019d think beautiful.\nI\u2019m going to bed.\u201d Miss Kite rose. The paper fan had somehow got itself\nbroken. She threw the fragments into the fire.\n\n\u201cIt is early yet,\u201d pleaded the stranger, \u201cI was looking forward to a\ntalk with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ll be able to look forward to it,\u201d retorted Miss Kite.\n\u201cGood-night.\u201d\n\nThe truth was, Miss Kite was impatient to have a look at herself in the\nglass, in her own room with the door shut. The vision of that other Miss\nKite--the clean-looking lady of the pale face and the brown hair had\nbeen so vivid, Miss Kite wondered whether temporary forgetfulness might\nnot have fallen upon her while dressing for dinner that evening.\n\nThe stranger, left to his own devices, strolled towards the loo table,\nseeking something to read.\n\n\u201cYou seem to have frightened away Miss Kite,\u201d remarked the lady who was\ncousin to a baronet.\n\n\u201cIt seems so,\u201d admitted the stranger.\n\n\u201cMy cousin, Sir William Bosster,\u201d observed the crocheting lady, \u201cwho\nmarried old Lord Egham\u2019s niece--you never met the Eghams?\u201d\n\n\u201cHitherto,\u201d replied the stranger, \u201cI have not had that pleasure.\u201d\n\n\u201cA charming family. Cannot understand--my cousin Sir William, I mean,\ncannot understand my remaining here. \u2018My dear Emily\u2019--he says the same\nthing every time he sees me: \u2018My dear Emily, how can you exist among the\nsort of people one meets with in a boarding-house.\u2019 But they amuse me.\u201d\n\nA sense of humour, agreed the stranger, was always of advantage.\n\n\u201cOur family on my mother\u2019s side,\u201d continued Sir William\u2019s cousin in her\nplacid monotone, \u201cwas connected with the Tatton-Joneses, who when King\nGeorge the Fourth--\u201d Sir William\u2019s cousin, needing another reel of\ncotton, glanced up, and met the stranger\u2019s gaze.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m telling you all this,\u201d said Sir William\u2019s\ncousin in an irritable tone. \u201cIt can\u2019t possibly interest you.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything connected with you interests me,\u201d gravely the stranger\nassured her.\n\n\u201cIt is very kind of you to say so,\u201d sighed Sir William\u2019s cousin, but\nwithout conviction; \u201cI am afraid sometimes I bore people.\u201d\n\nThe polite stranger refrained from contradiction.\n\n\u201cYou see,\u201d continued the poor lady, \u201cI really am of good family.\u201d\n\n\u201cDear lady,\u201d said the stranger, \u201cyour gentle face, your gentle voice,\nyour gentle bearing, all proclaim it.\u201d\n\nShe looked without flinching into the stranger\u2019s eyes, and gradually a\nsmile banished the reigning dulness of her features.\n\n\u201cHow foolish of me.\u201d She spoke rather to herself than to the stranger.\n\u201cWhy, of course, people--people whose opinion is worth troubling\nabout--judge of you by what you are, not by what you go about saying you\nare.\u201d\n\nThe stranger remained silent.\n\n\u201cI am the widow of a provincial doctor, with an income of just two\nhundred and thirty pounds per annum,\u201d she argued. \u201cThe sensible thing\nfor me to do is to make the best of it, and to worry myself about these\nhigh and mighty relations of mine as little as they have ever worried\nthemselves about me.\u201d\n\nThe stranger appeared unable to think of anything worth saying.\n\n\u201cI have other connections,\u201d remembered Sir William\u2019s cousin; \u201cthose of\nmy poor husband, to whom instead of being the \u2018poor relation\u2019 I could\nbe the fairy god-mama. They are my people--or would be,\u201d added Sir\nWilliam\u2019s cousin tartly, \u201cif I wasn\u2019t a vulgar snob.\u201d\n\nShe flushed the instant she had said the words and, rising, commenced\npreparations for a hurried departure.\n\n\u201cNow it seems I am driving you away,\u201d sighed the stranger.\n\n\u201cHaving been called a \u2018vulgar snob,\u2019\u201d retorted the lady with some heat,\n\u201cI think it about time I went.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe words were your own,\u201d the stranger reminded her.\n\n\u201cWhatever I may have thought,\u201d remarked the indignant dame, \u201cno\nlady--least of all in the presence of a total stranger--would have\ncalled herself--\u201d The poor dame paused, bewildered. \u201cThere is something\nvery curious the matter with me this evening, that I cannot understand,\u201d\n she explained, \u201cI seem quite unable to avoid insulting myself.\u201d\n\nStill surrounded by bewilderment, she wished the stranger good-night,\nhoping that when next they met she would be more herself. The stranger,\nhoping so also, opened the door and closed it again behind her.\n\n\u201cTell me,\u201d laughed Miss Devine, who by sheer force of talent was\ncontriving to wring harmony from the reluctant piano, \u201chow did you\nmanage to do it? I should like to know.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did I do what?\u201d inquired the stranger.\n\n\u201cContrive to get rid so quickly of those two old frumps?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow well you play!\u201d observed the stranger. \u201cI knew you had genius for\nmusic the moment I saw you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could you tell?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is written so clearly in your face.\u201d\n\nThe girl laughed, well pleased. \u201cYou seem to have lost no time in\nstudying my face.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a beautiful and interesting face,\u201d observed the stranger.\n\nShe swung round sharply on the stool and their eyes met.\n\n\u201cYou can read faces?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me, what else do you read in mine?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrankness, courage--\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, yes, all the virtues. Perhaps. We will take them for granted.\u201d It\nwas odd how serious the girl had suddenly become. \u201cTell me the reverse\nside.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see no reverse side,\u201d replied the stranger. \u201cI see but a fair girl,\nbursting into noble womanhood.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd nothing else? You read no trace of greed, of vanity, of sordidness,\nof--\u201d An angry laugh escaped her lips. \u201cAnd you are a reader of faces!\u201d\n\n\u201cA reader of faces.\u201d The stranger smiled. \u201cDo you know what is written\nupon yours at this very moment? A love of truth that is almost fierce,\nscorn of lies, scorn of hypocrisy, the desire for all things pure,\ncontempt of all things that are contemptible--especially of such things\nas are contemptible in woman. Tell me, do I not read aright?\u201d\n\nI wonder, thought the girl, is that why those two others both hurried\nfrom the room? Does everyone feel ashamed of the littleness that is in\nthem when looked at by those clear, believing eyes of yours?\n\nThe idea occurred to her: \u201cPapa seemed to have a good deal to say to you\nduring dinner. Tell me, what were you talking about?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe military looking gentleman upon my left? We talked about your\nmother principally.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d returned the girl, wishful now she had not asked the\nquestion. \u201cI was hoping he might have chosen another topic for the first\nevening!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did try one or two,\u201d admitted the stranger; \u201cbut I have been about\nthe world so little, I was glad when he talked to me about himself. I\nfeel we shall be friends. He spoke so nicely, too, about Mrs. Devine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d commented the girl.\n\n\u201cHe told me he had been married for twenty years and had never regretted\nit but once!\u201d\n\nHer black eyes flashed upon him, but meeting his, the suspicion died\nfrom them. She turned aside to hide her smile.\n\n\u201cSo he regretted it--once.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly once,\u201d explained the stranger, \u201cin a passing irritable mood. It\nwas so frank of him to admit it. He told me--I think he has taken a\nliking to me. Indeed he hinted as much. He said he did not often get an\nopportunity of talking to a man like myself--he told me that he and your\nmother, when they travel together, are always mistaken for a honeymoon\ncouple. Some of the experiences he related to me were really quite\namusing.\u201d The stranger laughed at recollection of them--\u201cthat even here,\nin this place, they are generally referred to as \u2018Darby and Joan.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the girl, \u201cthat is true. Mr. Longcord gave them that name,\nthe second evening after our arrival. It was considered clever--but\nrather obvious I thought myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing--so it seems to me,\u201d said the stranger, \u201cis more beautiful\nthan the love that has weathered the storms of life. The sweet, tender\nblossom that flowers in the heart of the young--in hearts such as\nyours--that, too, is beautiful. The love of the young for the young,\nthat is the beginning of life. But the love of the old for the old, that\nis the beginning of--of things longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou seem to find all things beautiful,\u201d the girl grumbled.\n\n\u201cBut are not all things beautiful?\u201d demanded the stranger.\n\nThe Colonel had finished his paper. \u201cYou two are engaged in a very\nabsorbing conversation,\u201d observed the Colonel, approaching them.\n\n\u201cWe were discussing Darbies and Joans,\u201d explained his daughter. \u201cHow\nbeautiful is the love that has weathered the storms of life!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d smiled the Colonel, \u201cthat is hardly fair. My friend has been\nrepeating to cynical youth the confessions of an amorous husband\u2019s\naffection for his middle-aged and somewhat--\u201d The Colonel in playful\nmood laid his hand upon the stranger\u2019s shoulder, an action that\nnecessitated his looking straight into the stranger\u2019s eyes. The Colonel\ndrew himself up stiffly and turned scarlet.\n\nSomebody was calling the Colonel a cad. Not only that, but was\nexplaining quite clearly, so that the Colonel could see it for himself,\nwhy he was a cad.\n\n\u201cThat you and your wife lead a cat and dog existence is a disgrace to\nboth of you. At least you might have the decency to try and hide it from\nthe world--not make a jest of your shame to every passing stranger. You\nare a cad, sir, a cad!\u201d\n\nWho was daring to say these things? Not the stranger, his lips had not\nmoved. Besides, it was not his voice. Indeed it sounded much more like\nthe voice of the Colonel himself. The Colonel looked from the stranger\nto his daughter, from his daughter back to the stranger. Clearly they\nhad not heard the voice--a mere hallucination. The Colonel breathed\nagain.\n\nYet the impression remaining was not to be shaken off. Undoubtedly it\nwas bad taste to have joked to the stranger upon such a subject. No\ngentleman would have done so.\n\nBut then no gentleman would have permitted such a jest to be possible.\nNo gentleman would be forever wrangling with his wife--certainly\nnever in public. However irritating the woman, a gentleman would have\nexercised self-control.\n\nMrs. Devine had risen, was coming slowly across the room. Fear laid\nhold of the Colonel. She was going to address some aggravating remark\nto him--he could see it in her eye--which would irritate him into savage\nretort.\n\nEven this prize idiot of a stranger would understand why boarding-house\nwits had dubbed them \u201cDarby and Joan,\u201d would grasp the fact that the\ngallant Colonel had thought it amusing, in conversation with a table\nacquaintance, to hold his own wife up to ridicule.\n\n\u201cMy dear,\u201d cried the Colonel, hurrying to speak first, \u201cdoes not this\nroom strike you as cold? Let me fetch you a shawl.\u201d\n\nIt was useless: the Colonel felt it. It had been too long the custom of\nboth of them to preface with politeness their deadliest insults to each\nother. She came on, thinking of a suitable reply: suitable from her\npoint of view, that is. In another moment the truth would be out. A\nwild, fantastic possibility flashed through the Colonel\u2019s brain: If to\nhim, why not to her?\n\n\u201cLetitia,\u201d cried the Colonel, and the tone of his voice surprised her\ninto silence, \u201cI want you to look closely at our friend. Does he not\nremind you of someone?\u201d\n\nMrs. Devine, so urged, looked at the stranger long and hard. \u201cYes,\u201d she\nmurmured, turning to her husband, \u201che does, who is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot fix it,\u201d replied the Colonel; \u201cI thought that maybe you would\nremember.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will come to me,\u201d mused Mrs. Devine. \u201cIt is someone--years ago,\nwhen I was a girl--in Devonshire. Thank you, if it isn\u2019t troubling you,\nHarry. I left it in the dining-room.\u201d\n\nIt was, as Mr. Augustus Longcord explained to his partner Isidore,\nthe colossal foolishness of the stranger that was the cause of all the\ntrouble. \u201cGive me a man, who can take care of himself--or thinks he\ncan,\u201d declared Augustus Longcord, \u201cand I am prepared to give a good\naccount of myself. But when a helpless baby refuses even to look at what\nyou call your figures, tells you that your mere word is sufficient for\nhim, and hands you over his cheque-book to fill up for yourself--well,\nit isn\u2019t playing the game.\u201d\n\n\u201cAuguthuth,\u201d was the curt comment of his partner, \u201cyou\u2019re a fool.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, my boy, you try,\u201d suggested Augustus.\n\n\u201cJutht what I mean to do,\u201d asserted his partner.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d demanded Augustus one evening later, meeting Isidore ascending\nthe stairs after a long talk with the stranger in the dining-room with\nthe door shut.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t arth me,\u201d retorted Isidore, \u201cthilly ath, thath what he ith.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he thay! talked about the Jewth: what a grand rathe they\nwere--how people mithjudged them: all that thort of rot.\n\n\u201cThaid thome of the motht honorable men he had ever met had been Jewth.\nThought I wath one of \u2018em!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, did you get anything out of him?\u201d\n\n\u201cGet anything out of him. Of courthe not. Couldn\u2019t very well thell the\nwhole rathe, ath it were, for a couple of hundred poundth, after that.\nDidn\u2019t theem worth it.\u201d\n\nThere were many things Forty-eight Bloomsbury Square came gradually\nto the conclusion were not worth the doing:--Snatching at the gravy;\npouncing out of one\u2019s turn upon the vegetables and helping oneself to\nmore than one\u2019s fair share; manoeuvering for the easy-chair; sitting on\nthe evening paper while pretending not to have seen it--all such-like\ntiresome bits of business. For the little one made out of it, really\nit was not worth the bother. Grumbling everlastingly at one\u2019s food;\ngrumbling everlastingly at most things; abusing Pennycherry behind her\nback; abusing, for a change, one\u2019s fellow-boarders; squabbling with\none\u2019s fellow-boarders about nothing in particular; sneering at one\u2019s\nfellow-boarders; talking scandal of one\u2019s fellow-boarders; making\nsenseless jokes about one\u2019s fellow-boarders; talking big about oneself,\nnobody believing one--all such-like vulgarities. Other boarding-houses\nmight indulge in them: Forty-eight Bloomsbury Square had its dignity to\nconsider.\n\nThe truth is, Forty-eight Bloomsbury Square was coming to a very good\nopinion of itself: for the which not Bloomsbury Square so much as\nthe stranger must be blamed. The stranger had arrived at Forty-eight\nBloomsbury Square with the preconceived idea--where obtained from\nHeaven knows--that its seemingly commonplace, mean-minded, coarse-fibred\noccupants were in reality ladies and gentlemen of the first water; and\ntime and observation had apparently only strengthened this absurd idea.\nThe natural result was, Forty-eight Bloomsbury Square was coming round\nto the stranger\u2019s opinion of itself.\n\nMrs. Pennycherry, the stranger would persist in regarding as a lady born\nand bred, compelled by circumstances over which she had no control to\nfill an arduous but honorable position of middle-class society--a sort\nof foster-mother, to whom were due the thanks and gratitude of her\npromiscuous family; and this view of herself Mrs. Pennycherry now clung\nto with obstinate conviction. There were disadvantages attaching, but\nthese Mrs. Pennycherry appeared prepared to suffer cheerfully. A lady\nborn and bred cannot charge other ladies and gentlemen for coals and\ncandles they have never burnt; a foster-mother cannot palm off upon her\nchildren New Zealand mutton for Southdown. A mere lodging-house-keeper\ncan play these tricks, and pocket the profits. But a lady feels she\ncannot: Mrs. Pennycherry felt she no longer could.\n\nTo the stranger Miss Kite was a witty and delightful conversationalist\nof most attractive personality. Miss Kite had one failing: it was lack\nof vanity. She was unaware of her own delicate and refined beauty. If\nMiss Kite could only see herself with his, the stranger\u2019s eyes, the\nmodesty that rendered her distrustful of her natural charms would fall\nfrom her. The stranger was so sure of it Miss Kite determined to put\nit to the test. One evening, an hour before dinner, there entered the\ndrawing-room, when the stranger only was there and before the gas\nwas lighted, a pleasant, good-looking lady, somewhat pale, with\nneatly-arranged brown hair, who demanded of the stranger if he knew her.\nAll her body was trembling, and her voice seemed inclined to run away\nfrom her and become a sob. But when the stranger, looking straight into\nher eyes, told her that from the likeness he thought she must be Miss\nKite\u2019s younger sister, but much prettier, it became a laugh instead: and\nthat evening the golden-haired Miss Kite disappeared never to show her\nhigh-coloured face again; and what perhaps, more than all else, might\nhave impressed some former habitue of Forty-eight Bloomsbury Square\nwith awe, it was that no one in the house made even a passing inquiry\nconcerning her.\n\nSir William\u2019s cousin the stranger thought an acquisition to any\nboarding-house. A lady of high-class family! There was nothing outward\nor visible perhaps to tell you that she was of high-class family. She\nherself, naturally, would not mention the fact, yet somehow you felt\nit. Unconsciously she set a high-class tone, diffused an atmosphere of\ngentle manners. Not that the stranger had said this in so many words;\nSir William\u2019s cousin gathered that he thought it, and felt herself in\nagreement with him.\n\nFor Mr. Longcord and his partner, as representatives of the best type\nof business men, the stranger had a great respect. With what unfortunate\nresults to themselves has been noted. The curious thing is that the Firm\nappeared content with the price they had paid for the stranger\u2019s good\nopinion--had even, it was rumoured, acquired a taste for honest men\u2019s\nrespect--that in the long run was likely to cost them dear. But we all\nhave our pet extravagance.\n\nThe Colonel and Mrs. Devine both suffered a good deal at first from\nthe necessity imposed upon them of learning, somewhat late in life, new\ntricks. In the privacy of their own apartment they condoled with one\nanother.\n\n\u201cTomfool nonsense,\u201d grumbled the Colonel, \u201cyou and I starting billing\nand cooing at our age!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I object to,\u201d said Mrs. Devine, \u201cis the feeling that somehow I am\nbeing made to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idea that a man and his wife cannot have their little joke together\nfor fear of what some impertinent jackanapes may think of them! it\u2019s\ndamn ridiculous,\u201d the Colonel exploded.\n\n\u201cEven when he isn\u2019t there,\u201d said Mrs. Devine, \u201cI seem to see him looking\nat me with those vexing eyes of his. Really the man quite haunts me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have met him somewhere,\u201d mused the Colonel, \u201cI\u2019ll swear I\u2019ve met him\nsomewhere. I wish to goodness he would go.\u201d\n\nA hundred things a day the Colonel wanted to say to Mrs. Devine, a\nhundred things a day Mrs. Devine would have liked to observe to the\nColonel. But by the time the opportunity occurred--when nobody else was\nby to hear--all interest in saying them was gone.\n\n\u201cWomen will be women,\u201d was the sentiment with which the Colonel consoled\nhimself. \u201cA man must bear with them--must never forget that he is a\ngentleman.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, well, I suppose they\u2019re all alike,\u201d laughed Mrs. Devine to herself,\nhaving arrived at that stage of despair when one seeks refuge in\ncheerfulness. \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of putting oneself out--it does no good,\nand only upsets one.\u201d There is a certain satisfaction in feeling you\nare bearing with heroic resignation the irritating follies of\nothers. Colonel and Mrs. Devine came to enjoy the luxury of much\nself-approbation.\n\nBut the person seriously annoyed by the stranger\u2019s bigoted belief in\nthe innate goodness of everyone he came across was the languid,\nhandsome Miss Devine. The stranger would have it that Miss Devine was a\nnoble-souled, high-minded young woman, something midway between a Flora\nMacdonald and a Joan of Arc. Miss Devine, on the contrary, knew herself\nto be a sleek, luxury-loving animal, quite willing to sell herself to\nthe bidder who could offer her the finest clothes, the richest foods,\nthe most sumptuous surroundings. Such a bidder was to hand in the person\nof a retired bookmaker, a somewhat greasy old gentleman, but exceedingly\nrich and undoubtedly fond of her.\n\nMiss Devine, having made up her mind that the thing had got to be done,\nwas anxious that it should be done quickly. And here it was that\nthe stranger\u2019s ridiculous opinion of her not only irritated but\ninconvenienced her. Under the very eyes of a person--however\nfoolish--convinced that you are possessed of all the highest attributes\nof your sex, it is difficult to behave as though actuated by only the\nbasest motives. A dozen times had Miss Devine determined to end the\nmatter by formal acceptance of her elderly admirer\u2019s large and flabby\nhand, and a dozen times--the vision intervening of the stranger\u2019s grave,\nbelieving eyes--had Miss Devine refused decided answer. The stranger\nwould one day depart. Indeed, he had told her himself, he was but a\npassing traveller. When he was gone it would be easier. So she thought\nat the time.\n\nOne afternoon the stranger entered the room where she was standing\nby the window, looking out upon the bare branches of the trees in\nBloomsbury Square. She remembered afterwards, it was just such another\nfoggy afternoon as the afternoon of the stranger\u2019s arrival three months\nbefore. No one else was in the room. The stranger closed the door, and\ncame towards her with that curious, quick-leaping step of his. His long\ncoat was tightly buttoned, and in his hands he carried his old felt hat\nand the massive knotted stick that was almost a staff.\n\n\u201cI have come to say good-bye,\u201d explained the stranger. \u201cI am going.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall not see you again?\u201d asked the girl.\n\n\u201cI cannot say,\u201d replied the stranger. \u201cBut you will think of me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she answered with a smile, \u201cI can promise that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I shall always remember you,\u201d promised the stranger, \u201cand I wish\nyou every joy--the joy of love, the joy of a happy marriage.\u201d\n\nThe girl winced. \u201cLove and marriage are not always the same thing,\u201d she\nsaid.\n\n\u201cNot always,\u201d agreed the stranger, \u201cbut in your case they will be one.\u201d\n\nShe looked at him.\n\n\u201cDo you think I have not noticed?\u201d smiled the stranger, \u201ca gallant,\nhandsome lad, and clever. You love him and he loves you. I could not\nhave gone away without knowing it was well with you.\u201d\n\nHer gaze wandered towards the fading light.\n\n\u201cAh, yes, I love him,\u201d she answered petulantly. \u201cYour eyes can see\nclearly enough, when they want to. But one does not live on love, in our\nworld. I will tell you the man I am going to marry if you care to know.\u201d\n She would not meet his eyes. She kept her gaze still fixed upon the\ndingy trees, the mist beyond, and spoke rapidly and vehemently: \u201cThe man\nwho can give me all my soul\u2019s desire--money and the things that money\ncan buy. You think me a woman, I\u2019m only a pig. He is moist, and breathes\nlike a porpoise; with cunning in place of a brain, and the rest of him\nmere stomach. But he is good enough for me.\u201d\n\nShe hoped this would shock the stranger and that now, perhaps, he would\ngo. It irritated her to hear him only laugh.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cyou will not marry him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho will stop me?\u201d she cried angrily.\n\n\u201cYour Better Self.\u201d\n\nHis voice had a strange ring of authority, compelling her to turn and\nlook upon his face. Yes, it was true, the fancy that from the very\nfirst had haunted her. She had met him, talked to him--in silent country\nroads, in crowded city streets, where was it? And always in talking\nwith him her spirit had been lifted up: she had been--what he had always\nthought her.\n\n\u201cThere are those,\u201d continued the stranger (and for the first time she\nsaw that he was of a noble presence, that his gentle, child-like eyes\ncould also command), \u201cwhose Better Self lies slain by their own hand\nand troubles them no more. But yours, my child, you have let grow too\nstrong; it will ever be your master. You must obey. Flee from it and it\nwill follow you; you cannot escape it. Insult it and it will chastise\nyou with burning shame, with stinging self-reproach from day to day.\u201d\n The sternness faded from the beautiful face, the tenderness crept back.\nHe laid his hand upon the young girl\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou will marry your\nlover,\u201d he smiled. \u201cWith him you will walk the way of sunlight and of\nshadow.\u201d\n\nAnd the girl, looking up into the strong, calm face, knew that it would\nbe so, that the power of resisting her Better Self had passed away from\nher for ever.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d said the stranger, \u201ccome to the door with me. Leave-takings\nare but wasted sadness. Let me pass out quietly. Close the door softly\nbehind me.\u201d\n\nShe thought that perhaps he would turn his face again, but she saw\nno more of him than the odd roundness of his back under the tightly\nbuttoned coat, before he faded into the gathering fog.\n\nThen softly she closed the door.",
