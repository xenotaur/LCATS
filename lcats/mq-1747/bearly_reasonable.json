    "body": "\u201cIke,\u201d sez Magpie Simpkins, pointin\u2019 down th\u2019 trail, \u201cth\u2019 feller what\nsaid, \u2018Th\u2019 worst is yet to come,\u2019 must \u2019a\u2019 meant that outfit comin\u2019\nour way.\u201d\n\nI takes uh good look and agrees. In th\u2019 lead is Ricky Henderson, on\nhis calico bronc, and behind him is three figgers on burrows. Th\u2019\nleadin\u2019 one looks like uh cross between uh Holy Roller proselyte and\nuh fence picket. Th\u2019 legs of th\u2019 critter is bent back at th\u2019 knees to\nkeep its feet off th\u2019 ground, an th\u2019 rest of its body \u2019pears to have\nbeen soaked in starch before it seasoned.\n\nIt\u2019s wearin\u2019 uh swaller-tailed coat, buttoned at th\u2019 top, makin\u2019 it\nswell in th\u2019 breeze like th\u2019 wings of uh turkey-buzzard, and th\u2019\npeaked, side-whiskered face which bobs at th\u2019 top is crowned with uh\nhard hat. It is also wearin\u2019 black-rimmed specs, and enough black\nribbon floats from th\u2019 top to furnish mournin\u2019 fer uh wake.\n\nTh\u2019 next in line is uh fe-male person, and uh glance shows that she\nain\u2019t built fer neither speed nor comfort. Th\u2019 pore li\u2019l burrow she\u2019s\nridin\u2019 is wig-waggin\u2019 uh distress signal with its ears, and threatens\nto cave in at th\u2019 knees in uh short time.\n\nTh\u2019 next in line is one uh them human carbuncles. He\u2019s so danged fat\nthat his clothes ache, and he has to lift his yaller eyebrows plumb to\nth\u2019 top of his bald head to git his eyes open. When I first sees his\nface I\u2019m inclined to git th\u2019 skin of uh aig to put on it and draw it\nto uh head.\n\nBehind this caravan loiters five burros and they\u2019re so danged loaded\ndown with plunder that all yuh can see is their ears. While me and\nMagpie stands on th\u2019 steps of our cabin, at th\u2019 Silver Threads mine,\nthis aggregation peerades to uh standstill before us, and that\nshe-packin\u2019 burro hee-haws with relief.\n\n\u201cHere we are,\u201d states Ricky, turnin\u2019 in his saddle and grinnin\u2019 at his\nfollowers.\n\n\u201cThank goodness!\u201d snorts th\u2019 fe-male. \u201cI feel that I\u2019m jolted to a\nshadow. Shall we dismount?\u201d\n\n\u201cRicky, yuh might make us used to yore friends, and tell us why you\nterminates th\u2019 peerade at this point,\u201d sez Magpie.\n\n\u201cThis person,\u201d sez Ricky, pointin\u2019 at th\u2019 lean critter, \u201cis Perfessor\nPhinney. Th\u2019 lady is his wife, and this here robust party is Doctor\nDoolittle. They\u2019re from th\u2019 East\u2014\u201d and then he turns to them:\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, this slender party with th\u2019 hairy upper lip is\nMagpie Simpkins, and th\u2019 bow-legged party beside him is Ike Harper,\nhis mate. Now that yo\u2019re properly introduced I\u2019ll pilgrim back. _Au\nrevoir._\u201d\n\n\u201cYuh will\u2014in uh hearse,\u201d snaps Magpie. \u201cCome back here, yuh blamed\ncoyote and explain why yuh shirks yore duty. What\u2019s th\u2019 great idea?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy duty is done,\u201d states Ricky. \u201cThese here persons desire to hire\ncompetent persons so I brings\u2019 em up here. Every man in Piperock holds\nup their hands and swears that they ain\u2019t competent, so what could I\ndo? You and Ike shore must be. I reckon th\u2019 perfessor can tell yuh\nwhat he wants, Magpie. I hates to deprive yuh of my company, but I\u2019m\nuh right busy man.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo depravity, Ricky,\u201d sez Magpie. \u201cRun right along home.\u201d\n\nAnd then he turns to th\u2019 outfit. Th\u2019 three of \u2019em are off their\nmounts, and busy rubbin\u2019 th\u2019 circulation back into their legs. I feels\nthat th\u2019 perfessor has some chore, \u2019cause he has quite uh strip uh\ncountry to hear from.\n\n\u201cI\u2014er\u2014shall try and explain in a few words,\u201d sez th\u2019 perfessor,\npeekin\u2019 at us over th\u2019 tops of his specs. \u201cI am up here to settle an\nargument between myself and Professor Manning. Isn\u2019t it queer what an\nargument between friends will bring forth?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d agrees Magpie. \u201cShe shore is. I\u2019ve knowed six good men to\ngit killed on th\u2019 spot, four more in th\u2019 pen, and dozens who have been\ncrippled fer life over friendly arguments.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow unique!\u201d exclaims th\u2019 perfessor\u2019s heavier half. \u201cHow unique.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2019m,\u201d agrees Magpie, \u201ctwo of \u2019em was, but th\u2019 rest was jist common\nordinary arguments.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I was\u2014er\u2014saying,\u201d continues th\u2019 perfessor, \u201cI am up here to settle\na friendly argument.\u201d\n\n\u201cTh\u2019 question is?\u201d asks Magpie.\n\n\u201cDo rattlesnakes and prairie-dogs live together in harmony, and will a\nfemale grizzly recognize its own offspring after it has been away\nfrom, it for twenty-four hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s uh \u2014\u2014 of uh reason fer comin\u2019 way up here!\u201d snorts Magpie.\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t yuh write to me? I\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 told yuh.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said,\u201d cuts in th\u2019 human carbuncle. \u201cWhen you told me\nabout it I\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDoctor,\u201d pipes th\u2019 perfessor, \u201cthere\u2019s no use arguing with me. This\nis a serious question. Professor Manning\u2019s theory is wrong, and I am\ngoing to prove it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYuh can\u2019t prove nothin\u2019 by uh rattler,\u201d objects Magpie. \u201cAlso, yuh\ngot uh sweet chore on yore hands when yuh tries to git uh female\ngrizzly to let yuh take its cub and\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t I believe my own eyes?\u201d wails th\u2019 ol\u2019 pelican. \u201cCan\u2019t I see\nthese things?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy husband, being a scientist, is very observing,\u201d states Mrs.\nPerfessor.\n\n\u201cAlso set in his ways,\u201d states th\u2019 doc, lightin\u2019 one uh them dude\ncigarets, which smells like th\u2019 place where uh circus has jist moved\naway. \u201cAll I hope is that I get some good shooting.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf th\u2019 perfessor interviews uh fe-male grizzly and fambly, yuh shore\nstand uh good chance uh gittin\u2019 yore wish,\u201d sez I. \u201cUnpack them\nlong-sufferin\u2019 jackasses and make yoreself to home. Th\u2019 hills is\nyours.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnpack?\u201d asks th\u2019 perfessor. \u201cDo you mean to remove the impedimenta\nfrom the backs of our beasts of burden?\u201d\n\n\u201cBein\u2019 funny is a art,\u201d states Magpie, \u201cbut art ain\u2019t appreciated here\nin th\u2019 hills. Jist take th\u2019 plunder off them canaries, and settle\ndown.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, my man, that\u2019s your duty. That\u2019s part of what I\u2019m paying you\nfor.\u201d\n\nMagpie looks foolish like at me and then back at th\u2019 perfessor. Th\u2019\ndoc lifts his eyebrows to th\u2019 eaves of his face and manages to wiggle\none eyelid until uh person would almost admit it was uh wink.\n\n\u201cPerfessor,\u201d sez Magpie, \u201cI ain\u2019t yore man. I never seen yuh before,\nand I ain\u2019t worryin\u2019 about yuh in th\u2019 future. I never hired out to\nyuh, and I ain\u2019t acquainted with yore rollin\u2019 stock to th\u2019 extent that\nI wishes to remove their loads. Who wished yuh on to us anyway and\nwhy?\u201d\n\nTh\u2019 perfessor removes his hard hat and squints at Magpie.\n\n\u201cThe\u2014er\u2014person who brought us up here informed me that you were\nperfectly competent. Was we misinformed?\u201d\n\n\u201cMisinformed? No, ol\u2019-timer, you was lied to. Sabe?\u201d\n\n\u201cTh\u2019 fact of th\u2019 matter is this,\u201d states th\u2019 doc. \u201cProfessor Phinney\nwants to engage the services of you and Mister Harper. He is willing\nto pay you a reasonable amount for your services, and is also able to\noffer a substantial bonus in case you can help him prove or disprove\nhis contention. Am I right, Professor?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeaus,\u201d drawls th\u2019 ol\u2019 coot.\n\nHe\u2019s uh funny ol\u2019 rooster. He allus sez \u201cYeaus\u201d instead uh \u201cUh-huh.\u201d I\ndon\u2019t reckon he ever figgered that th\u2019 Lord only give him one set uh\nvocal cords, or else he didn\u2019t care if he did wear \u2019em out early in\nlife. Every danged word he orates sounds like th\u2019 letters had been\ncarved out uh granite, and he was afraid to let \u2019em all fall to oncet\nfer fear some of \u2019em might git scratched or busted.\n\n\u201cYuh might explain th\u2019 bonus part,\u201d sez Magpie.\n\n\u201cYou see,\u201d sez th\u2019 perfessor, \u201cfor my own personal satisfaction I\nwould observe the home life of the rattlesnake and prairie-dog, but\nthe most important is the test of the maternal instinct in the grizzly\nbear.\n\n\u201cI shall expect you to furnish me with the opportunity to carry out\nthis experiment to a satisfactory conclusion, and in case you can do\nso to my satisfaction, I am willing to remunerate you to the extent of\ntwo hundred dollars each. Of course I am prepared to pay you each five\ndollars per day. Do you feel competent to assist me?\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nMagpie sticks his thumbs into his belt, shifts his weight on to one\nleg, and squints at them burros.\n\n\u201cIke,\u201d sez he, \u201cremove th\u2019\u2014er\u2014imped\u2014 imped\u2014th\u2019 packs off them beasts\nuh burden.\u201d\n\nAnd then to th\u2019 perfessor:\n\n\u201cCompetent is my middle name. When it comes to th\u2019 maternal instinct\nof grizzly bears I feels as competent as uh hungry coyote in uh herd\nuh sick sheep. Ike is a authority on snakes and gophers, so between us\nI reckon you\u2019ll git enough material to last yuh a lifetime. What do\nyuh know about grizzlies?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing at all,\u201d sez th\u2019 perfessor. \u201cI fear that I wouldn\u2019t know one\nif I were to meet it. I\u2019ll admit it was a foolish argument, when\nneither Professor Manning nor myself are at all familiar with natural\nhistory, but it is things like this that lend zest to life. Am I\nright, Mister Simpson?\u201d\n\n\u201cSimpkins,\u201d sez Magpie. \u201cUh-huh, I reckon it does. Yessir, I\u2019d shore\nagree that it might. But, Perfessor, if I was in yore place, not bein\u2019\nfamiliar with grizzlies, I\u2019d shore side-step anythin\u2019 I met that\nwasn\u2019t familiar. There\u2019s one redeemin\u2019 feature about uh grizzly\u2014he\ndon\u2019t stop to argue. One or two uh them square-heads would put enough\nzest in uh man\u2019s life to keep him supplied fer right smart of uh\ntime.\u201d\n\nWell, that shore was some outfit. Them packs looks like uh travelin\u2019\nbanquet. There\u2019s three foldin\u2019 bunks, sleepin\u2019 bags, rubber bathtubs\nand most everything that uh man can\u2019t use in th\u2019 hills. Also there is\nenough fancy grub to feed uh roundup. I manages to git them things off\nth\u2019 jacks, and Magpie comes over and looks \u2019em over.\n\n\u201cMy Gawd,\u201d sez he. \u201cThis is th\u2019 limit, hammered to uh sharp point.\nWhat\u2019ll we do with \u2019em, Ike?\u201d\n\n\u201cYore uh competent,\u201d sez I. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me what to do, Magpie Simpson.\nIs th\u2019 perfessor\u2019s squaw goin\u2019 to git supper?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is not, and yuh might call me by my right name. Th\u2019 perfessor sez\nthat he was informed by Mister Henderson that Mister Harper is th\u2019\nbest culinary artist in th\u2019 State. Uh culinary artist is uh polite\nname fer uh bull cook, Ike.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds re-fined, anyway,\u201d I agrees. \u201cBut some uh these day\u2019s I\u2019m\ngoin\u2019 to git my meat-hooks on Ricky Henderson, and there\u2019s goin\u2019 to be\nsorrow in th\u2019 Henderson tribe. Culinary artist \u2014\u2014! Can\u2019t th\u2019 doctor\ncook?\u201d\n\n\u201cTh\u2019 doctor can\u2019t do nothin\u2019, Ike. He informs me that th\u2019 one ambition\nin life is to hit somethin\u2019 with his shotgun. Sez he never had and\nnever expects to, but he\u2019s game to keep on tryin\u2019.\u201d\n\nPretty soon th\u2019 doc comes down from th\u2019 cabin, and sets down on one of\nth\u2019 packs. He dusts th\u2019 end of uh cigaret on his hand, and grins at me\nand Magpie.\n\n\u201cSome outfit, eh?\u201d he sez. \u201cWhat do yuh think of it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d sez Magpie, \u201cI knowed uh feller oncet what got hung fer sayin\u2019\nwhat he thought, so with this one short remark I\u2019ll close\u2014awful!\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d agrees th\u2019 doc, explodin\u2019 uh cloud uh smoke that would\nasphyxiate uh gila monster. \u201cI quite agrees with you. You see th\u2019\nprofessor has a lot more money than any ordinary professor ought to\nhave and if he wishes to spend it on a proposition like this it\u2019s none\nof our funeral.\u201d\n\n\u201cTh\u2019 first part of yore oration sounds sensible,\u201d sez Magpie, \u201cbut th\u2019\nlast line ain\u2019t exactly true. Knowin\u2019 th\u2019 natcheral disposition of uh\nfe-male grizzly, I\u2019d say that it might be our funeral. Jist because\nwe\u2019re merely accessories to th\u2019 fact don\u2019t affect th\u2019 gray matter in\nth\u2019 skull of uh she-grizzly.\n\n\u201cAll men looks alike to her. Mebby she\u2019d shy at th\u2019 perfessor, but I\u2019m\nbettin\u2019 that uh rear view of th\u2019 ol\u2019 boy goin\u2019 up uh tree or doin\u2019 th\u2019\nvanishin\u2019 act over uh hill might fool uh mad grizzly into thinkin\u2019 she\nwas chasin\u2019 uh real, honest-to-grandma man. Uh course she\u2019d find out\nher mistake, but by that time it\u2019s too late to rectify it. No\nself-respectin\u2019 rattler\u2019d bite him, either, but yuh got to figger that\nnobody ever met uh self-respectin\u2019 rattler. No, sir, I reckon we got\nto close-herd th\u2019 perfessor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be there with my shotgun,\u201d grins th\u2019 doc. \u201cMebby I could hit uh\nbear with it. That would be some satisfaction.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it wouldn\u2019t bother th\u2019 bear,\u201d sez I. \u201cIf yuh feels like tryin\u2019\nout that two-tunneled spray-weapon on uh bear, take this advice: Try\none barrel on th\u2019 bear and th\u2019 other on yoreself. Mebby it\u2019s jist uh\nli\u2019l out uh place fer uh stranger to tell uh feller how to pass out uh\nthis here vale uh tears, but uh scatter-gun don\u2019t compare with uh\ngrizzly when it comes to messy-lookin\u2019 corpses. Them animiles shore do\nadmire to take yuh apart.\u201d\n\nI cooked supper that night. One thing in my favor was th\u2019 fact that\nth\u2019 perfessor\u2019s wife is too hungry and tired to make any suggestions.\nI ain\u2019t no dog-gone French cook, but I shore hates to have uh fe-male\nperson tell me how to cook beans. We worries through supper without no\ncasualties, and after we gits through, Mrs. Per-fessor goes to bed on\nmy bunk, and th\u2019 rest of us sets out in front of th\u2019 cabin and smokes\nuh while.\n\n\u201cMy man,\u201d sez th\u2019 perfessor to Magpie, \u201cit is my desire to investigate\nthe grizzly theory tomorrow morning. I suppose you are prepared to\nguide me to the lair of a fairly good specimen?\u201d\n\n\u201cShore,\u201d sez Magpie. \u201cUh course I\u2019ll have to look over my field notes\nuh while before I can locate edzactly th\u2019 specimen yuh needs. Uh\ncourse yuh wants uh grizzly with uh grizzly offspring.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeaus,\u201d drawls th\u2019 ol\u2019 pelican. \u201cYeaus, certainly. Quite naturally a\ngrizzly would have a grizzly offspring.\u201d\n\n\u201cNatcherally,\u201d agrees Magpie. \u201cBut yuh often finds \u2019em with black or\nbrown cubs. Yuh see, Perfessor, uh she-grizzly is uh motherly ol\u2019\nthing, and when she finds uh female black or brown bear which don\u2019t\ntreat their li\u2019l ones properly she jist natcherally adopts \u2019em.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite commendable,\u201d nods th\u2019 perfessor. \u201cI must make a note of it.\nSuch information is quite valuable. But don\u2019t the other bears object\nto losing the custody of their offsprings?\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite useless,\u201d drawls Magpie. \u201cAs I remarked before, uh grizzly\nwon\u2019t argue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a feeling that this trip is going to furnish some material for\nthe scientists to ponder over,\u201d laughs th\u2019 doc, gittin\u2019 up and\nthrowin\u2019 away his camel-hair cigaret. \u201cI must see that my shotgun is\nin good working order.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid yuh ever shoot any fool-hens?\u201d I asks.\n\nTh\u2019 doc grins at me in uh wise sort of uh way and replies:\n\n\u201cMister Harper, I may be a poor shot, but I\u2019m not that much of a\ntenderfoot, so don\u2019t try that old joke on me, please.\u201d\n\nMost of \u2019em won\u2019t bite on th\u2019 fool-hen stunt, fer th\u2019 simple reason\nthat there ain\u2019t no joke about fool-hens. Now, if yuh spoke about\nsnow-snakes they\u2019d stay all Winter to git uh specimen.\n\nIt wa\u2019n\u2019t edzactly what you\u2019d call chivalry that prompts us to give up\nour cabin to our employers that night. When uh two hundred and fifty\npound fe-male occupies yore three by six bunk, and fills th\u2019 air with\nsnores which resembles th\u2019 grunts of uh hungry bear trying to coax uh\nfat grub out of uh rotten stump, it\u2019s jist human nature to grab uh\nblanket and move out in th\u2019 brush. Th\u2019 doc crawls into his\nsleepin\u2019-bag alongside th\u2019 cabin, but me and Magpie holes up down near\nth\u2019 crick.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat night I wonders out-loud, in Magpie\u2019s hearin\u2019, what are we goin\u2019\nto do? Also I mentions in my oration that any man what ain\u2019t got no\nmore sense than to tie up with uh rattle-headed pardner, not\nmentionin\u2019 any names, but givin\u2019 uh fair description, ought to die\nearly in life in self-defense.\n\n\u201cField book!\u201d I howls at th\u2019 Big Dipper. \u201cHe\u2019s got uh field book what\nshows th\u2019 dwellin\u2019-place of suitable female grizzlies. Them records\nwill show jist which said grizzly has bears by adoption and which has\n\u2019em by maternal instinct. I\u2019m a expert on sidewinders and gophers, eh?\nShore. All my life I\u2019ve laid on my belly and observed th\u2019 home life uh\nsaid whistlin\u2019 diggers and crippled crawlers. I\u2019ve allus crawled in\nth\u2019 best society uh Prairie Dog town. Accordin\u2019 to th\u2019 latest reports\nI\u2019m livin\u2019 in uh dug-out and cultivatin\u2019 fangs. Pretty soon I\u2019m due to\ncoil up and bite somebody.\u201d\n\nMagpie don\u2019t say uh word all th\u2019 time I\u2019m reflectin\u2019 out loud, but\nafter I rolls up in my blanket and drowses off to sleep he grabs me by\nth\u2019 shoulder and hisses in my ear\u2014\n\n\u201cIke, I\u2019ve got it!\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep it,\u201d sez I. \u201cI don\u2019t care if we are pardners, Magpie, I don\u2019t\nwish to share it with yuh. I know you\u2019ve had it fer uh long time, ol\u2019\ntrapper, but I never mentioned it to anybody. If it hurts yuh worse\nthan usual, I\u2019d advise uh cold compress on yore dome.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Mighty\u2019 Jones,\u201d he yells joyful like. \u201cBy cripes. I can see it all!\u201d\n\nSometimes when uh feller gits to ravin\u2019 thataway he sez things about\nfolks that he don\u2019t like, so I don\u2019t comment on him mentionin\u2019 Mighty\nJones.\n\nUh course his right name ain\u2019t Mighty. He\u2019s uh pore li\u2019l runty person,\nwith corn-colored hair, and whiskers which makes him resemble uh\nmountain goat gone to seed. One day he gits into a argument with uh\nwhale of uh jasper named \u201cBuzzard\u201d Bell. Buzzard is big enough to tie\nJones in uh bow-knot, and he grins down at Jones and informs him of\nth\u2019 fact. Jones takes off his coat, throws it on th\u2019 floor, jumps on\nit with both boots, spits on his hands and yells:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m small but I\u2019m Gawd A\u2019mighty Jones!\u201d That\u2019s how he gits th\u2019\ncognomen.\n\nHe\u2019s livin\u2019 up in uh li\u2019l cabin at th\u2019 forks of Plenty Stone crick,\nand he ain\u2019t noways friendly nor confidential. He\u2019s plumb afraid that\nsomebody will jump his alleged copper claim, which don\u2019t assay enough\nper ton to plate uh twenty-two cartridge shell.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s goin\u2019 to work out to uh gnat\u2019s eyebrow, Ike,\u201d states Magpie\nwhen I don\u2019t seem uh heap concerned over his former joyful\ndeclaration.\n\n\u201cYuh might tell uh man yore troubles,\u201d sez I.\n\nMagpie sets up in his blankets and rolls uh cigaret.\n\n\u201cYessir,\u201d sez he, after th\u2019 smoke is goin\u2019, \u201cthat\u2019s th\u2019\nsolution\u2014partly. Ike, we could use Mighty Jones\u2019s bear fer this here\nscientific experiment.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d I agrees. \u201cWe shore could, only fer several reasons.\nMighty\u2019s animile happens to be uh brown bear and, bein\u2019 as its name is\nAbe, it don\u2019t stand to reason that its got any maternal instinct, much\nless uh cub. And what is uh heap more to th\u2019 point, Magpie: Mighty\nwould perforate anybody what bothered that brute. If Mighty had about\ntwice as much sense as he\u2019s got he\u2019d be half-witted, and I argues that\nuh fool and uh shotgun is dangerous. Them\u2019s my sentiments, Magpie. Th\u2019\nwhole thing is crazy. Yore all crazy, Magpie. Th\u2019 perfessor is loco,\nth\u2019 doc is likewise afflicted and Mrs. Perfessor is showin\u2019 symptoms.\nYou been crazy fer years and years, Magpie, and I\u2019m gittin\u2019 suspicious\nuh myself. Let\u2019s put some cyanide in their coffee in th\u2019 morning, and\nthen you and me will go down in Death Valley and dig fer coconuts,\nMagpie. And besides we ain\u2019t got no cub fer Abie.\u201d\n\n\u201cObjextions all overruled, Ike. In th\u2019 first place, Perfessor Phinney\nnor any of them wouldn\u2019t know uh brown bear from uh grizzly, and in\nth\u2019 second place, we\u2019ll go down cautious like and rent Mighty\u2019s bear.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll we do fer uh cub?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014\u2014!\u201d snorts Magpie. \u201cWe\u2019re sharin\u2019 fifty-fifty in this here ain\u2019t we?\nWell, I done furnished my part. I got th\u2019 mother grizzly didn\u2019t I?\nWell, you git th\u2019 cub. Sabe?\u201d\n\n\u201cLoan me yore field notes on cubs, will yuh? I\u2019m uh snake specialist\nand\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nDidn\u2019t Magpie tell th\u2019 perfessor he had one? Shore did. That\u2019s what\nmakes Magpie\u2019s conduct so danged inconsistent. He didn\u2019t have no right\nto git sore about it. Anyway, it\u2019s showin\u2019 danged little knowledge uh\nsocial etikette when uh feller hits yuh on th\u2019 head with uh rock as\nbig as yore fist\u2014especially when yore in bed. Uh course I returns it\nin th\u2019 proper spirit, but my feelin\u2019s is soarin\u2019 and I shoots high.\n\nDid yuh ever hear half uh dozen long-eared, flea-bitten jackasses\nsplit th\u2019 stillness of th\u2019 night with their melodjus voices? Don\u2019t\ntell me that animiles like that don\u2019t talk to each other. They shore\nmust or they couldn\u2019t know jist when to cut loose all to oncet\nthataway, and make th\u2019 short hair on th\u2019 back uh yore neck crawl right\nover and tickle yuh under th\u2019 chin.\n\nThat herd of Rocky Mountain canaries cuts loose right over our\nrecumbent forms and scares delirious delight out of our feelin\u2019s fer\nuh minute. They jist orates one short, \u201cHa-a-aaw!\u201d and then quits\ncold.\n\nWe stands erect in our blankets and sez things to them jacks, but they\njist nods in th\u2019 gloom, and wiggles their ears. They sorta surrounds\nus, and won\u2019t go away. Not bein\u2019 in need uh any more music, we gits\npeevish like.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go over across th\u2019 crick,\u201d sez Magpie. \u201cThem blasted animile\nCarusos is too friendly, and it\u2019s uh cinch they\u2019ll stay on this side\nof th\u2019 crick.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe ambles down toward th\u2019 crick, still wrapped in our blankets, like\nuh pair uh Injuns, when all to oncet we gits another sensation.\n\n\u201cWhang! Zee-e-e-e! Whang! Zee-e-e-e!\u201d\n\nTh\u2019 gentle evenin\u2019 is shattered. It\u2019s bad enough to have yore\near-drums shattered, but when each shatter is followed by uh handful\nuh bird-shot, which \u201cskees\u201d and \u201czees\u201d across yore form and fills yore\neyes with lint from yore blanket, it\u2019s time to investigate. Magpie is\nnear th\u2019 crick bank when it happens, and I looks up jist in time to\nsee Magpie disappear over th\u2019 bank, and uh splash informs me that he\nis in th\u2019 wet.\n\n\u201cMy \u2014\u2014!\u201d I hears uh voice opine. \u201cI believe I hit them. I wish I had\nsome buckshot, but I haven\u2019t and\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBung! Zee-e-e-e!\u201d goes that scatter-gun ag\u2019in, only this time it\u2019s\nboth barrels. I hears Magpie spit out uh personal cuss word and splash\nback into th\u2019 crick.\n\n\u201cHeaven is my home,\u201d states uh voice in th\u2019 gloom, which I recognizes\nas bein\u2019 that of th\u2019 doctor, and I hears him rastlin\u2019 around in th\u2019\nbrush.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s that blamed gun, anyway?\u201d he whines. \u201cI never shot two loads\nto once before, and after this\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCut\u2014cut\u2014cut it out, yuh blamed maverick!\u201d quavers Magpie, and I sees\nhis arms wavin\u2019 over th\u2019 bank of th\u2019 crick in uh signal uh distress.\n\n\u201cGracious! Did I hit you? Did it go past you?\u201d yells th\u2019 doc.\n\nMagpie raises his string-bean carcass on th\u2019 bank, shakes th\u2019 water\nout of his hair, and whoops:\n\n\u201cWhat went past? Yuh blasted, overfed, red-faced porkypine. What do\nyuh reckon yo\u2019re tryin\u2019 to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cCalm yourself,\u201d advises th\u2019 doc. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for me you all\nmight be dead. What do you think of that?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d sez Magpie. \u201cI\u2019m like Patrick Henry thataway. If I can\u2019t have\nliberty I\u2019ll take uh li\u2019l death. When fellers like you are pesticatin\u2019\naround uh feller\u2019s liberty is shore restricted. What was yuh tryin\u2019 to\nkill, anyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat made that noise?\u201d hedges th\u2019 doc. \u201cWhat made it, eh? I heard it,\nand comes out to investigate. I saw what I took to be two skulking\nanimals, so I gave each one a load of shot. One of them jumped into\nthe creek, but I gave it both barrels as it went out the other side.\nThis gun kicked so hard that it was impossible for me to determine\nwhat my execution was. I hope it was deadly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I ever has uh hand in it, Doc, it shore will,\u201d sez Magpie. \u201cBetter\ngo on back to bed.\u201d\n\nTh\u2019 doc ambles back to his bed, and we recovers Magpie\u2019s blanket. It\njist missed uh watery grave.\n\n\u201cGosh,\u201d sez Magpie. \u201cMissed with both barrels at ninety feet. Let\u2019s go\nover in th\u2019 brush and sleep. Mebby them jacks will wail ag\u2019in, and yuh\ncan\u2019t expect uh feller to miss every time with uh scatter-gun.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas it uh female?\u201d asks uh husky voice behind us, and there stands\nth\u2019 perfessor in uh white nightie, on one foot, while he industriously\npicks cactus out of th\u2019 other. He looks like th\u2019 ghost of some hy-iu\nwhite crane.\n\n\u201cWhat you heard, Perfessor,\u201d sez Magpie, \u201cwas uh fool! Better git back\nto bed before he mistakes yuh fer uh white owl.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeaus. Exactly,\u201d agrees th\u2019 ol\u2019 coot, and he limps back. Magpie is uh\nbit damp, but th\u2019 night is warm, so he states that he\u2019d rather sleep\nthataway than to take uh chance on goin\u2019 near th\u2019 cabin.\n\nWe sleeps some late th\u2019 next mornin\u2019, and th\u2019 first thing we hears is\nthat blamed shotgun. Somewhere up th\u2019 gulch th\u2019 doc is tearin\u2019 holes\nin th\u2019 solitude. We ambles up to th\u2019 cabin, and finds Mrs. Perfessor\nsettin\u2019 on th\u2019 steps. Honest to grandma, she\u2019s uh sight. That person\nwa\u2019n\u2019t no beautiful vi\u2019let last night, but this mornin\u2019 she don\u2019t\nqualify a-tall.\n\n\u201c_Klahowya_,\u201d sez Magpie. \u201cDid yuh sleep well, ma\u2019am?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, there you are,\u201d sez she, ignorin\u2019 Magpie\u2019s salutation, and\nlookin\u2019 at me. \u201cWhen do I get some hot water?\u201d\n\n\u201cDrink or laundry?\u201d I asks.\n\nShe bristles up as much as uh fat woman like her can bristle after uh\nnight on uh real hard bunk, and snorts\u2014\n\n\u201cDo you expect me to wash in cold water?\u201d\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d sez I, \u201cwhen it comes to expectin\u2019 things I pass up wimmen.\nNot havin\u2019 known me only uh few hours, and most uh them at night, I\ndon\u2019t see why my expectations should interest yuh so much. In this\ncountry uh person don\u2019t git so awful dirty jist sleepin\u2019, so we figger\nthat anybody what is so much of uh dude as to want to wash in th\u2019\nmornin\u2019 can do it in cold water.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want some hot water and I want it immediately!\u201d she howls, and\nwaddles into th\u2019 cabin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say that th\u2019 perfessor is more to be pitied than censured,\u201d sez\nMagpie. \u201cAfter listenin\u2019 to her, and observin\u2019 her face and figger, I\ncan\u2019t believe th\u2019 perfessor\u2019s statement that he\u2019s ignorant uh natural\nhistory. She\u2019s shore uh bear, Ike, and I\u2019d\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that water ready for my ablution?\u201d sez Mrs. Perfessor, stickin\u2019\nher head out of th\u2019 door.\n\n\u201cRight away,\u201d sez I, goin\u2019 over and pickin\u2019 up some sticks.\n\nI don\u2019t aim to invade her boodwah. Our stove ain\u2019t five feet from my\nbunk, so I makes our li\u2019l fire outside. Magpie follers me over with uh\ncan uh water and puts it on th\u2019 fire.\n\n\u201cCripes!\u201d sez he. \u201cAin\u2019t uh woman uh queer proposition, Ike? She said\nat first that she wants to wash her face and\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe said she wanted to wash. She didn\u2019t designate her face, Magpie.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. What is a ablution, Ike?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do I know,\u201d I snorts. \u201cI ain\u2019t no ladies\u2019 maid, Magpie. If yuh\nwanted to know about rattlesnakes I\u2019d be up on that.\u201d\n\nI gives her th\u2019 can uh hot water and she operates in th\u2019 cabin, so we\ndon\u2019t know yet what she done. I jist gits breakfast on th\u2019 fire when\nth\u2019 doc shows up. He does uh double shuffle in th\u2019 trail when he gits\nin sight and seems tickled all over about somethin\u2019.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t got breakfast ready yet have you?\u201d he whoops, as he leans\nhis shotgun ag\u2019in th\u2019 cabin. \u201cHeaven is my home! At last I have hit\nsomething.\u201d\n\nHe digs down in th\u2019 pockets of his huntin\u2019 coat, and dumps uh pile uh\nbirds on th\u2019 ground.\n\n\u201cBlue grouse,\u201d he pronounces. \u201cI found a fine flock of them up th\u2019\ngulch. Can we have them for breakfast, Mister Harper?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely,\u201d gurgles Mrs. Perfessor. \u201cI adore wild game.\nThis will be a breakfast to remember. It must be wonderful to live in\na country like this where you can go out and kill your meals.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeaus,\u201d agrees th\u2019 perfessor. \u201cI\u2019ll have mine grilled, if you don\u2019t\nmind.\u201d\n\nI looks at Magpie, who is rollin\u2019 uh cigaret and lookin\u2019 at th\u2019\nground, and sez to him\u2014\n\n\u201cHow would you like yore\u2019s, Mister Simpkins?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever eat meat fer breakfast,\u201d he states. \u201cI\u2019ll jist take some mush\nand bacon. Anyway, there ain\u2019t more\u2019n enough fer our guests.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can go and git some more,\u201d sez th\u2019 happy sawbones. \u201cGreatest sport\nI ever had. They\u2019re not a bit wild. I\u2019m going to enjoy this meal\nbecause it\u2019s the first one I ever furnished in this way.\u201d\n\nIt was th\u2019 only one of its kind I ever cooked, that\u2019s uh cinch. They\nate \u2019em, but there was\u2019n\u2019t much joy over that meal. Th\u2019 Doc rastles\none of \u2019em around fer uh while and gits up enough appetite to eat\nflap-jacks. When he finishes he lights one uh them burn-easy cigarets\nand opines to me that blue grouse is overrated as uh delicacy. I ain\u2019t\ngot th\u2019 heart to disagree with him, and Magpie jist nods and turns\naway to light uh cigaret. Moose birds ain\u2019t edzactly what you\u2019d call\n\u201csweet and tender.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201cAre yuh ready to go with me?\u201d asks Magpie, when we\u2019re alone ag\u2019in.\n\n\u201cGo where?\u201d\n\n\u201cDown to see Mighty Jones.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to take two of us to bring that tame ol\u2019 bear back\nhere, Magpie, and besides I\u2019m goin\u2019 to be uh heap busy tryin\u2019 to\nlocate uh offspring fer it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to bring it back here, Ike. Ain\u2019t yuh got no\nimagination a-tall? Th\u2019 perfessor orates that he desires uh wild\ngrizzly, and it\u2019s uh cinch he ain\u2019t ignorant enough to accept uh\ndomestic bear. We got to produce this here animile in his native\nhaunts to make th\u2019 play come right.\u201d\n\nAll th\u2019 time we\u2019re pilgrimin\u2019 down to Mighty\u2019s wickiup he\u2019s ponderin\u2019\non uh place to stake out that bear.\n\n\u201cBetter git th\u2019 cub and it\u2019s mama before yuh rents uh bungaloo fer\n\u2019em,\u201d I advises. \u201cI feels that there\u2019s liable to be many uh slip from\nth\u2019 grizzly to th\u2019 perfessor. I needs that two hundred, Magpie, but\nwhen it comes to gittin\u2019 into trouble, Ike Harper is neutral.\u201d\n\nThis here li\u2019l ol\u2019 goat-headed Jones party sticks his head out of his\ncabin door and stares at me and Magpie. He don\u2019t look friendly a-tall.\n\n\u201cWe come down to git yer bear,\u201d sez Magpie. \u201cIn th\u2019 interests uh\nscience I asks yuh to\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nMighty must uh had that shotgun in his hand behind th\u2019 door, \u2019cause\nMagpie only gits uh runnin\u2019 start on his oration when we\u2019re gazin\u2019\ndown uh two-barreled muzzle-loader.\n\n\u201cGit!\u201d sez Mighty.\n\nMagpie looks right past Mighty\u2019s off ear and yells\u2014\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t hit him with that club!\u201d\n\nI reckon Mighty must uh been excited to fall fer uh trick as ol\u2019 as\nthat, but he did. He whirls that ol\u2019 gun around, an th\u2019 next thing he\nknowed, Magpie has him pinned to th\u2019 floor and I\u2019m removin\u2019 the caps\noff that gun.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d sez Magpie, \u201cmebby you\u2019ll listen to reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will like \u2014\u2014!\u201d snaps Mighty. \u201cI\u2019ll listen to what Magpie Simpkins\nhas to say, but I\u2019ll be teetotally danged if I\u2019ll agree that it\u2019s\nreason.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe comes on uh peaceful mission and meets uh armed force,\u201d states\nMagpie. \u201cIf yuh wants visitors to carry uh flag uh truce, why don\u2019t\nyuh advertise th\u2019 fact, Mighty?\u201d\n\n\u201cI minds my own business,\u201d snorts Mighty. \u201cGo ahead and talk, and I\u2019ll\nlisten if it chokes me.\u201d\n\nMagpie sets on Mighty\u2019s floatin\u2019 ribs, and tells him our troubles.\n\n\u201cBut my bear ain\u2019t no fe-male and I ain\u2019t got no cub,\u201d protests\nMighty. \u201cAnyway, ol\u2019 Abe is sick. I reckon he\u2019s gittin\u2019 too blamed\nol\u2019. Seems like he don\u2019t harbor nothin\u2019 but uh bellyache, Magpie. I\nbeen dopin\u2019 th\u2019 ol\u2019 sinner fer weeks to keep him on his feet.\nDog-gone, he\u2019s th\u2019 only friend I got left. I tries to give him uh dose\nuh castor ile yesterday, and he tore my shirt off and swallers th\u2019\nwhole bottle. I don\u2019t reckon it\u2019ll do him any good thataway do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf yuh knowed jist what part uh his anatomy it\u2019s reposin\u2019 in yuh\nmight kick him and loosen th\u2019 cork,\u201d I suggests, but Mighty shakes his\nhead.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be done, Ike. Th\u2019 cork was broke off short.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d asks Magpie, risin\u2019 from Mighty\u2019s carcass, and\nsettin\u2019 on th\u2019 bunk.\n\nMighty rubs th\u2019 creases out of his skin, and rolls uh smoke.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s up on th\u2019 hill back uh my stable, I reckon. Danged ol\u2019 toothless\nwalloper\u2019s done formed uh friendship with uh badger. Can yuh beat it?\nThem two sets up there on uh rock in th\u2019 sun and snoozes all day.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeavenly dove!\u201d whoops Magpie, grab-bin\u2019 Mighty by th\u2019 wishbone. \u201cDo\nyuh suppose they\u2019re up there now?\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckon,\u201d gasps Mighty. \u201cLeggo my neck, dog-gone yuh. What\u2019s there\nto git excited about?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo yuh reckon we could ketch that badger?\u201d askes Magpie.\n\n\u201cI reckon yuh could. He ain\u2019t uh bit wild. I pretty nigh puts my hands\non him yesterday when I goes up to try and feed Abe some liver pills.\nI leaves some fer th\u2019 badger but I don\u2019t reckon he took \u2019em.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell yuh what I\u2019ll do,\u201d sez Magpie. \u201cIf you\u2019ll rent us yore bear and\nhelp us take him over to that ol\u2019 tunnel uh Big Foot Smith\u2019s and let\nus use him fer uh few days I\u2019ll give yuh ten dollars. We\u2019ll guarantee\nnot to hurt th\u2019 ol\u2019 feller none.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s reasonable, Magpie, but I don\u2019t sabe what yuh wants th\u2019 badger\nfer.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we can pass ol\u2019 Abe off as uh fe-male grizzly, I don\u2019t reckon\nwe\u2019ll have much trouble in passin\u2019 that badger off fer its cub.\nDog-gone it, they look uh heap like uh li\u2019l bear, at that, Mighty.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow yuh goin\u2019 to ketch him?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s yore chore, Ike. Git uh rope and make good.\u201d\n\nTh\u2019 Harper tribe allus was noted fer their gameness. I gits Mighty\u2019s\nrope and ambles up back of th\u2019 stable. I sees th\u2019 bear. He\u2019s sunnin\u2019\nout there on uh ledge uh rock, and don\u2019t pay no attention to me\na-tall. I reckon he\u2019s got troubles of his own which keeps him\noccupied. I sneaks around behind him, and there I sees Mister Badger.\nHe\u2019s shore uh whopper, and he\u2019s stretched out on th\u2019 rock with his\nhead turned th\u2019 other way.\n\nI gits th\u2019 loop to swingin\u2019 right, and braces my feet. I ain\u2019t what\nyou\u2019d call a expert with uh rope. In fact I\u2019m of th\u2019 garden variety\nwhen it comes to swingin\u2019 th\u2019 rope, but I\u2019m game. I gives th\u2019 rope uh\nlast whirl and lets her go. Did I git that badger? I\u2019d tell uh man I\ndid! Also, I gits th\u2019 bear.\n\nUh bear and uh badger may be good pals when they\u2019re separated, but\nfriendship ceases when yuh pulls \u2019em together in th\u2019 loop of uh rope.\nAlso they makes it uncomfortable fer th\u2019 party on th\u2019 other end of th\u2019\nrope.\n\nWhen I stops at th\u2019 cabin I ain\u2019t wearin\u2019 no pants, but I got uh\u2019\nstrangle holt on that ol\u2019 badger. Pore ol\u2019 Abie gits loose about\nhalf-way home, and he shore moves spry-like to th\u2019 top of th\u2019 cabin,\nwhere he orates his displeasure and shows symptoms uh liver trouble.\nThey helps me hog-tie that badger, and then Mighty complains uh heap\nabout his pet.\n\n\u201cIke, yuh ought to be careful about Abe,\u201d sez he. \u201cThere wa\u2019n\u2019t no\nsense in gittin\u2019 him all excited thataway. Mebby he\u2019ll have uh\nrelapse, and I ain\u2019t got uh liver pill left. He\u2019s uh sick animile.\u201d\n\n\u201cTh\u2019 \u2014\u2014 he is!\u201d sez I. \u201cHe tore my pants off, and almost clears th\u2019\ncabin in one jump, so I don\u2019t reckon he\u2019s so danged bad off. We got\nfemale folks at our house, so I reckon yuh better loan me uh pair uh\npants to go home in, Mighty.\u201d\n\nHe ain\u2019t got nothin\u2019 but uh pair uh overalls, which don\u2019t meet by six\ninches at th\u2019 waist and lingers jist below th\u2019 knee, but I puts \u2019em\non. We ties th\u2019 badger to uh pole, which me and Magpie packs, and\nMighty leads Abe and his bellyache with uh rope. Big Foot\u2019s prospect\nain\u2019t been worked fer so long that it\u2019s all grown up ag\u2019in and looks\nlike uh natcheral cave.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s th\u2019 idea,\u201d states Magpie. \u201cWe\u2019ll put th\u2019 bear and badger in\nth\u2019 ol\u2019 tunnel. Then we\u2019ll git th\u2019 perfessor and his outfit to come\nover and see us separate them. We\u2019ll keep that alleged cub over to th\u2019\ncabin long enough to satisfy th\u2019 perfessor. Sabe?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got another think comin\u2019 if you thinks that Abe and that ol\u2019\nbadger is goin\u2019 to hibernate peaceful like in that hole while yu goes\nover to head th\u2019 peerade,\u201d objects Mighty. \u201cSince Ike stirred \u2019em up\nthataway, Abe ain\u2019t acted noways friendly toward th\u2019 badger, and said\nbadger ain\u2019t got no love fer nobody after ridin\u2019 upside down on uh\npole fer two miles. How am I goin\u2019 to know how Abie\u2019s bellyache is,\nall this time. I can\u2019t stay with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think I\u2019m goin\u2019 to lose all that money jist because there\nain\u2019t no love lost between two dumb brutes?\u201d snorts Magpie. \u201cBig Foot\nmust uh been afraid that somebody was goin\u2019 to invade his ol\u2019 prospect\nwhen he built that door at th\u2019 entrance, but he shore simplified\nthings fer us. We\u2019ll stick Abe and his imitation cub inside an\u2019 block\nth\u2019 door. By th\u2019 time we git back they\u2019ll be friendly ag\u2019in.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbie\u2019s bellyache\u2014\u201d begins Mighty, but Magpie shuts him up.\n\n\u201cGosh A\u2019mighty, you gives me uh pain! No wonder that pore bear\u2019s got\nuh stummick ache. You\u2019d give uh wooden Injun th\u2019 pip, Mighty. Mebby if\nyuh quits givin\u2019 him all them patent medicines he\u2019d be uh heap better\nbear and last longer. That stuff\u2019s causin\u2019 all his hair to come out.\nIf yuh don\u2019t quit he won\u2019t even make uh decent rug.\u201d\n\nAbie goes in plumb willin\u2019 but the badger objects. He tries to squeeze\nout, but twistin\u2019 uh stick in his hide sorta disgusts him and he\nretires. Mighty pilgrims off home, and me and Magpie goes back to our\ncabin.\n\n\u201cIke,\u201d orates Magpie, \u201cthis is uh cinch. That badger resembles uh li\u2019l\nbear uh heap, don\u2019t yuh know it? Also, Abie is so shy on hair that\nnobody could prove whether he\u2019s black, brown or gray. Let\u2019s be glad.\u201d\n\n\u201cLets be glad uh li\u2019l later on,\u201d I suggests. \u201cI\u2019m strong on this here\ngladsome stuff, Magpie, but this here idea uh countin\u2019 yore scientific\nexperiments before they\u2019re done experimentin\u2019 is uh heap like lightin\u2019\nyore last match to see if it\u2019s uh good one before yuh goes to th\u2019\ntrouble uh makin\u2019 uh cigaret.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nTh\u2019 perfessor is sunnin\u2019 hisself by th\u2019 cabin when we gits back, and\nth\u2019 doc is fussin\u2019 with uh pho-tygraft apparatus. They welcomes us\nreal heartily, and th\u2019 perfessor is uh heap excited and pleased to\nknow that we\u2019re ready fer th\u2019 experiment.\n\n\u201cI hope I can get some good action in a bear picture,\u201d states th\u2019 doc.\n\u201cIt will help in provin\u2019 th\u2019 perfessor\u2019s experiments.\u201d\n\nThat was some pilgrimage. We strings out in single file, with Magpie\nin th\u2019 lead and th\u2019 perfessor next. We places th\u2019 fe-male next in\nline, allowin\u2019 considerable space between her and th\u2019 doc, in case she\nshould rear up and fall over backwards on some of th\u2019 steep pitches.\nAlso, fer safety sake I packs th\u2019 doc\u2019s shotgun. When we reaches the\nalleged bear den we finds Mighty settin\u2019 at th\u2019 door.\n\n\u201cAbe\u2019s ailin\u2019 ag\u2019in,\u201d sez he, solemn like, lookin\u2019 th\u2019 outfit over.\n\n\u201cWho is Abe?\u201d asks th\u2019 doc.\n\n\u201cHis pardner,\u201d states Magpie, winkin\u2019 hard at Mighty. \u201cHe seems to\nhave pains in his stummick most of th\u2019 time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAppendicitis,\u201d pronounces th\u2019 doc. \u201cMay need an operation.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoctor,\u201d sez th\u2019 perfessor, \u201cthis is no time to talk of operations.\nPrepare your camera and try and picture the proceedings.\u201d And then he\nasks Magpie\u2014\n\n\u201cAre you sure that the mother and young are in the cave?\u201d\n\n\u201cPore ol\u2019 Abe comes to th\u2019 door and\u2014\u201d complains Mighty, but th\u2019 doc\npats him on th\u2019 shoulder and sez:\n\n\u201cNever mind. Just as soon as possible I will diagnose his case. I may\nhave to remove his appendix.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t reckon that\u2019s what ails him a-tall,\u201d states Mighty. \u201cYuh see\nhe\u2019s been used to havin\u2019 his meat cut up fer him but, bein\u2019 as I ain\u2019t\nno Daniel, I didn\u2019t care to center th\u2019 den, so I jist throws in uh\nsaddle uh venison to him and slams th\u2019 door. Mebby he overeats.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnique way to treat a patient, isn\u2019t it, Doctor?\u201d puffs Mrs.\nPerfessor, from where she rests her bulk on uh log.\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d agrees th\u2019 doc, reprovin\u2019 like. \u201cYou should have given him\nsome broth.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever had none,\u201d sez Mighty. \u201cPatent medicines don\u2019t help him none,\nanyway. Say, Magpie, I got to worryin\u2019 about Abe and his roommate\ngittin\u2019 in uh fight so I comes over after you left and tied th\u2019 cub to\nuh timber in there.\u201d\n\nThat made it plumb easy. All we has to do is go inside, lead th\u2019 cub\nout and shut th\u2019 door. Ol\u2019 Abe pokes his head out and wails uh few\nstanzas, and th\u2019 doc snaps his pitcher machine.\n\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d whoops th\u2019 perfessor. \u201cYou men have earned that bonus\nright now. You have shown yourselves so competent that I am willing to\nchance the rest of it. Do you suppose your friend here, with the sick\npartner, would accept a small remuneration for his services?\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout uh doubt,\u201d sez Mighty, before Magpie has uh chance to open\nhis mouth and th\u2019 perfessor slips Mighty a yaller-backed bill.\n\n\u201cThanks, ol\u2019-timer,\u201d sez Mighty. \u201cThat\u2019ll buy me one uh them things\nwhat yuh grind meat up in. Yuh see, Abe\u2019s teeth ain\u2019t what they used\nto be, and when he eats meat he gits them pains and he\u2019s liable to\nbite or claw \u2014\u2014, I begs yore pardon, ma\u2019am, out uh me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot appendicitis symptoms,\u201d states th\u2019 doc. \u201cDoes he have\nhallucinations?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d sez Mighty. \u201cLeastwise I don\u2019t reckon he has. He\u2019s showed\nsymptoms uh St. Vitus dance and th\u2019 bellyache and has moulted most of\nhis hair, but I reckon that ol\u2019 age sneakin\u2019 up on him makes him\nthataway more\u2019n anythin\u2019 else.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow old is he?\u201d asks Mrs. Perfessor.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know edzactly, ma\u2019am. I killed his mother when he was comin\u2019 uh\nyear ol\u2019 but I don\u2019t remember what year that was. He\u2019s had uh lot uh\nsickness, ma\u2019am, and most all th\u2019 hair\u2019s rubbed off his belly, which\nuh course makes him look older than he really is. Sabe?\u201d\n\nMebby she don\u2019t sabe, but anyway, she don\u2019t ask no more questions. She\ntakes uh sixty hoss-power look at Mighty, and ambles right off up th\u2019\ntrail. Th\u2019 doc looks sorta surprised at Mighty, but th\u2019 perfessor\ndon\u2019t pay no attention. He\u2019s busy gloatin\u2019 over that badger.\n\n\u201cGracious,\u201d sez he. \u201cThe young of the grizzly surely do mature young.\nDoctor, just look at those claws. Do they lose that stripe on the back\nlike a young deer loses it\u2019s spots?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d sez Magpie. \u201cAll bears is striped when they\u2019re born, except\nblack ones and they\u2019re purple\u201d.\n\nMe and Magpie has to pack that badger all th\u2019 way over to our cabin.\nWe tries to lead it, but that wasn\u2019t a success. It starts all right,\nbut th\u2019 perfessor is in th\u2019 road, figgerin\u2019 in his note-book. That\nrope gits familiar with his long legs, and he\u2019s some strung out when\nwe gits \u2019em separated, but he don\u2019t mind. He sets there on th\u2019 ground\nand figgers in his note-book, while we untangles th\u2019 rope off his\nfeet, and never pays no attention a-tall.\n\nWhen we gits home we ties th\u2019 badger to uh tree. Me and Magpie figgers\nthat our labors is over fer uh while, so we aims to take life easy fer\nuh spell. Th\u2019 doc is busy shootin\u2019 up th\u2019 tin cans around camp, Mrs.\nPerfessor is croshayin\u2019 what looks like uh pair uh ear-muffs fer uh\nblacktail deer, and th\u2019 perfessor is studyin\u2019 th\u2019 actions of uh peeved\nbadger, so me and Magpie goes down on th\u2019 crick, where we got some\nbedrock stripped.\n\nWe\u2019re busy pannin\u2019 out some dirt about an hour later when we hears an\nuproar back at th\u2019 cabin.\n\n\u201cNow, somebody has gone and raised \u2014\u2014\u201d snorts Magpie. \u201cThem is\nnatcherally quiet folks, Ike, and not given to loud nor unseemly\nnoises, so there must be uh good reason. Mebby that danged badger\u2019s\ngot away.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore likely th\u2019 doc\u2019s hit somethin\u2019,\u201d I orates. \u201cMebby he mistakes\nth\u2019 perfessor\u2019s wife fer uh tin can. She\u2019s built thataway.\u201d\n\nWe hikes back to camp and finds things considerable disturbed. Th\u2019 doc\nis settin\u2019 on th\u2019 steps of th\u2019 cabin, wearin\u2019 uh injured expression\nand uh torn shirt. Mrs. Perfessor is limpin\u2019 around th\u2019 place like uh\nhound pup cuttin\u2019 circles to find uh place to lay down. Perfessor\nPhinney is still settin\u2019 there studyin\u2019 th\u2019 badger, which seems\nconsiderable riled over somethin\u2019.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s th\u2019 trouble?\u201d asks Magpie.\n\n\u201cMaternal instinct!\u201d snorts th\u2019 doc.\n\n\u201cNothing to get excited about,\u201d wheezes th\u2019 lady, tearin\u2019 uh strip uh\ncloth off her skirt, and cinchin\u2019 up uh cut on her wrist. \u201cPerhaps it\nwasn\u2019t a complete success, Doctor, but we\u2019ll have to do it again\nsooner or later. It was merely a humane act.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019m not very strong for humanity. Hereafter I draw the line to\nplaying wet nurse to a grizzly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe overlooked one point,\u201d states Mrs. Perfessor, wise like. \u201cTo\nremove an offspring of that age from its mother is like taking the\nsunshine from the flowers or the dew from the grass. Know what I\nmean?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe means,\u201d states th\u2019 doc, fingerin\u2019 th\u2019 long gash in his pant leg.\n\u201cShe means that th\u2019 blasted brute needs milk to prolong its young\nlife, and she induces me to help her let it imbibe condensed milk from\na can.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was interesting to note that condensed milk did not appeal to its\npalate,\u201d remarks th\u2019 perfessor, makin\u2019 more notes in his book.\n\n\u201cMy \u2014\u2014,\u201d sez Magpie. \u201cDid yuh try to feed it cold canned milk?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, did it need warming?\u201d asks th\u2019 lady.\n\n\u201cShore thing. They won\u2019t eat it cold. Next time yuh wants to set th\u2019\ncan on the stove fer about fifteen minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cLive and learn,\u201d quotes th\u2019 doc. \u201cI knew something was wrong.\u201d\n\nThat night Mighty Jones comes over to git somethin\u2019 fer uh tooth ache.\n\n\u201cGol\u2019 A\u2019mighty,\u201d sez he. \u201cI got to have somethin\u2019 or lose my mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s all, yuh ain\u2019t so danged bad off,\u201d sez Magpie. \u201cBut rather\nthan see yuh lose somethin\u2019 yuh never had I\u2019ll let yuh take our Jap\noil bottle. Rub uh li\u2019l on th\u2019 tooth, and she\u2019ll be better than new.\u201d\n\nMighty takes th\u2019 bottle and goes off down th\u2019 trail holdin\u2019 on to his\njaw. Did yuh ever hear of Jap oil? It\u2019s th\u2019 concentrated essense uh\ndynamite, hell\u2019s fire and asphyxiation. It cures anything. Never knew\nanybody to ask fer uh second helpin\u2019, but it shore is uh whole\nmedicine chest fer uh prospector. It\u2019s jist as good fer penumonia as\nit is fer uh busted leg, and I knowed uh feller oncet who kept th\u2019\npack-rats out of his cabin by jist pastin\u2019 th\u2019 label off uh bottle on\nhis front door. Achin\u2019 teeth is jist uh vacation chore to that\nmedicine.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nTh\u2019 next mornin\u2019 me and Magpie goes over to do uh li\u2019l work on th\u2019\ncrick, and th\u2019 doc goes off across th\u2019 hills with his shotgun. Th\u2019\nperfessor and th\u2019 badger gits busy watchin\u2019 each, other ag\u2019in. Long\nabout ten o\u2019clock we decides to drift back to camp to see how things\nis progressin\u2019.\n\nWe\u2019re up on uh point above th\u2019 shack where we can git uh clear view uh\nth\u2019 country, and about two hundred yards below th\u2019 cabin we sees th\u2019\ndoc. He\u2019s doin\u2019 uh reg\u2019-lar Injun sneak in some bull-pines. We watches\nhim sorta sad like fer uh while, figgerin\u2019 that he won\u2019t hit what he\u2019s\nsneakin\u2019 on, when we happens to see what he\u2019s after. Up th\u2019 creek\nbottom comes Mighty Jones and Abe. Abe is humpin\u2019 along about ten feet\nahead uh Mighty. Mighty seems uh heap sore at th\u2019 bear, and anxious to\novertake him.\n\n\u201cBlasted ol\u2019 ossified porkypine,\u201d wails Magpie. \u201cBringin\u2019 that\nmoth-eaten, alleged grizzly right over where it spoils our whole game.\nLet\u2019s git down there and stop him in th\u2019 brush.\u201d\n\nWe breaks down past camp. Th\u2019 perfessor is still studyin\u2019 th\u2019 badger.\nMrs. Perfessor sticks her head out of th\u2019 door and yells somethin\u2019 at\nus as we goes past, but we don\u2019t stop\u2014not a-tall. We\u2019re jist passin\u2019\nth\u2019 cabin, when:\n\n\u201cBlam! Blam!\u201d goes doc\u2019s shotgun down in th\u2019 timber.\n\n\u201cCome on, Ike!\u201d pants Magpie, stretchin\u2019 out his long legs like uh\nbull elk goin\u2019 to water, and hurdlin\u2019 everythin\u2019 except the\nlodge-pole. He didn\u2019t need to waste his wind thataway. I\u2019m with him.\n\nWe busts into uh li\u2019l clearin\u2019, where we first sees th\u2019 doc doin\u2019 his\nsneak, and we runs into th\u2019 queerest bunch uh misery I ever seen. I\u2019ve\nseen uh cougar with th\u2019 St. Vitus dance and an ulcerated tooth, and\nI\u2019ve beheld uh jack-rabbit which was shot in th\u2019 north end with uh\nload uh rock-salt, but by th\u2019 whisperin\u2019 wolves, this here exhibition\nmakes \u2019em all look like uh stachoo uh peaceful moments. Right there in\nth\u2019 clearin\u2019 is pore ol\u2019 Abe, and he shore is adjustin\u2019 hisself to\nsuit local conditions.\n\nFirst he puts his head down between his front legs and does uh lot uh\ncontortion work that would stump uh snake. He whizzes across th\u2019\nclearin\u2019 like uh fur pin-wheel, uncouples hisself and comes back with\nhis nose in th\u2019 dirt and sorrow in his soul.\n\nHe\u2019s jist about half-way back, and me and Magpie is standin\u2019 there\nwith our jaw-bones restin\u2019 on our chests, when:\n\n\u201cBling! Bling!\u201d goes uh six-gun.\n\nNot knowin\u2019 th\u2019 angle uh them shots, we immediate and soon assumes uh\nreclinin position.\n\nMebby them shots was uh heap opportune, cause if we hadn\u2019t uh laid\ndown of our own accord, ol\u2019 Abe shore would have spread us some.\n\nHe didn\u2019t seem to pay no attention to them shots, but somethin\u2019 in his\ncarcass seems to say, \u201cGo east, ol\u2019 bear, go east,\u201d and Abie shore\nheeds th\u2019 summons, and hurries right across us.\n\nHe plants one foot on th\u2019 part uh my carcass where uh civilized man\nwears his rear collar button, and his long toe-nails seems to shake\ndice all th\u2019 way down my vertebray.\n\nWe arises too late to see him leave, but he\u2019s shore pointed toward our\nhappy home.\n\n\u201cAbie seems to have hit his second childhood,\u201d yawns Magpie. \u201cI\u2019d \u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDid I hit it?\u201d yells uh voice across th\u2019 clearin\u2019, and there stands\nth\u2019 doc.\n\nHe shore is uh sight. He sets there, hangin\u2019 onto uh tree, and tries\nto watch four directions to oncet. His hat is gone along with uh lot\nof his clothes, and his respect as uh big game hunter seems to leak\nout of every pore.\n\n\u201cThere was two,\u201d he wails. \u201cI shot one, and before I could see whether\nI had killed it or not, the other one walked all over me. I didn\u2019t\nknow they went in flocks. I lost my gun. I wonder if I hit it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d states uh voice behind us, and there stands Mighty Jones.\nHe\u2019s standin\u2019 sorta bent forward at th\u2019 waist line, while one hand\nexplores th\u2019 rear of his pants.\n\n\u201cDid I hit it?\u201d asks th\u2019 Doc, ag\u2019in, sorta eager like, and Mighty\nreplies more in sorrow than in anger:\n\n\u201cYou shore did. Both loads, dad bust yore soul\u2014and me without no\ndrawers on. I tries to smear yuh with my six-gun, but finds that all\nI\u2019m shootin\u2019 at is yore hat and part uh yore shirt on uh bush.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, Mighty,\u201d sez Magpie, gittin\u2019 around on th\u2019 windward side of th\u2019\nol\u2019 jasper, \u201cyou must uh took uh bath in that Jap oil. You shore are\nodoriferous, ol\u2019-timer. Whew!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt slopped uh li\u2019l,\u201d sez Mighty. Abe was ailin\u2019 somethin\u2019 awful over\nin that ol\u2019 prospect, and I figgers that th\u2019 doc would relieve him uh\nheap if I brings him over. I reads th\u2019 epitaph on that bottle and it\norates that it\u2019s good fer cramps.\n\n\u201cI tries to give some to Abe but he don\u2019t warm up to th\u2019 smell a-tall.\nIn fact he won\u2019t even associate with me, and ambles ahead uh me all\nth\u2019 way over. Down here uh li\u2019l ways I manages to overhaul him and\nshoves th\u2019 whole works down his blamed neck. It shore animates him uh\nheap, Magpie. I\u2019m watchin\u2019 him go spry like and loudly off into the\nbrush, when all to oncet two loads uh bird-shot comes along and hives\ninto th\u2019 seat uh my pants. It riles me uh heap. I\u2019ll leave it to you\nif bird-shot ain\u2019t aggravatin\u2019, Magpie.\u201d\n\nTh\u2019 doc gits enough of th\u2019 conversation to learn that he\u2019s shot\nMighty, and he seems uh heap concerned. He\u2019s still hangin\u2019 onto that\ntree, but he holds up his other hand and sez:\n\n\u201cNo more, I\u2019m through using a gun. Mister Jones, would you accept that\ngun as a present?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, ain\u2019t that \u2014\u2014?\u201d wails Mighty. \u201cAin\u2019t it, Magpie? Here I been\nwantin\u2019 uh britch loader shotgun fer years, and jist when somebody\ngives me one I\u2019ve already tied th\u2019 danged thing around uh tree so it\nwon\u2019t never shoot no more. Ain\u2019t that cheerin\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d sez I, \u201clets go up to th\u2019 cabin and see how things is shapin\u2019\nup there. I has uh feelin\u2019 that all our good works is ravelin\u2019 out.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe gits almost to th\u2019 cabin when we sees th\u2019 perfessor. He\u2019s settin\u2019\non th\u2019 ground near where th\u2019 badger was tied to uh tree, but there\nain\u2019t no sign of th\u2019 badger, and Abe ain\u2019t in sight.\n\nTh\u2019 perfessor\u2019s black coat is split up th\u2019 back, and his hard hat is\ncirclin\u2019 his arm like uh band uh crape. There\u2019s uh scratch th\u2019 whole\nlength uh his face, but he\u2019s still grinnin\u2019 and tryin\u2019 to write on one\nleaf uh that li\u2019l book. Th\u2019 rest is some tore up and scattered.\n\n\u201cI was right!\u201d he squeaks. \u201cI told Professor Manning that the parent\nbear would seek and find its young. They went away together. I had\nuntied the cub to take it down to the creek for a drink, when the\noutraged mother came along and forcibly freed her baby. She\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBang!\u201d\n\nFrom th\u2019 inside of th\u2019 cabin comes th\u2019 report of uh heavy shootin\u2019\niron, and Mrs. Perfessor spills out of th\u2019 door, and skates her three\nhundred pounds off th\u2019 porch. She sets there and claws th\u2019 hair out of\nher eyes.\n\n\u201cRemarkable performance!\u201d exclaims th\u2019 perfessor. \u201cShe never fired a\nshot before.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2014it\u2014it buh\u2014buh\u2014busted,\u201d she stutters, pointin\u2019 at th\u2019 cabin.\n\n\u201cWimmin ought to let guns alone\u2014also some men,\u201d states Mighty, still\nprospectin\u2019 fer lead on th\u2019 rear of his personal property.\n\n\u201cGun,\u201d snorts th\u2019 injured lady. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t no gun.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was it, my dear?\u201d asks th\u2019 Perfessor.\n\n\u201cMilk,\u201d she snaps. \u201cMilk for the bear.

She forgot to\npunch uh hole in th\u2019 top of th\u2019 can.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind, my dear,\u201d consoles th\u2019 perfessor. \u201cMy contention is\nproved, and we can leave at once. We\u2019ll adjust matters with our\nemployees and go home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about th\u2019 snake theory, Perfessor?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cDo they or don\u2019t they?\u201d he asks, haulin\u2019 out th\u2019 remains uh that li\u2019l\nbook.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t,\u201d sez I. \u201cThey never have and never will.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt least I can point with pride to the fact that I hit something,\u201d\nremarks th\u2019 doc with uh grin, when he gits on his burro and lights\nanother one uh them stinkin\u2019 rolls. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t have a rifle,\nI might have killed a bear.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf yuh can see this far, and sabe th\u2019 direction, yuh might point with\npride to th\u2019 fact that I can\u2019t set down fer uh week,\u201d orates Mighty.\n\n\u201cPerfessor,\u201d sez Magpie, \u201cwould yuh mind tellin\u2019 me jist edzactly what\ncompetent means?\u201d\n\nTh\u2019 perfessor adjusts th\u2019 remains uh that hard hat on his peaked head,\nand squints at Magpie over th\u2019 top uh them funereal-rimmed glasses.\n\u201cWhy,\u2014er\u2014it means, adequate or sufficient.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d sez Magpie. \u201cIt shore is and we have had. _Adios._\u201d\n\n\u201cIt stands to reason\u2014\u201d begins Magpie, as th\u2019 caravan goes off down th\u2019\ntrail, with Mrs. Perfessor\u2019s burro squeakin\u2019 and groanin\u2019 at th\u2019 rear,\nbut Mighty ceases scratchin\u2019 long enough to snort:\n\n\u201cReason, eh?
