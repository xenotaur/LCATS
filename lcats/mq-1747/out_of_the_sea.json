    "body": "Anyone but Webb Fallon would have been worried sick. He was down to his\nlast five dollars and quart of Scotch. His girl Madge had sketched him\ncategorically in vitriol, and married somebody else. His job on the\nLos Angeles _Observer_ was, like all the jobs he\u2019d ever had, finally,\ndefinitely, and for all time, cancelled.\n\nBeing Webb Fallon, he was playing a fast game of doubles on the\nvolley-ball court at Santa Monica Beach, letting the sun and the salt\nair clear off a hangover.\n\nWhen he came off the court, feeling fine and heading for the water, big\nChuck Weigal called to him.\n\n\u201cSo the _Observer_ finally got wise to you, huh? How come?\u201d\n\nFallon grinned, his teeth white against the mahogany burn of his\nhard, lean oval face. His corded body gleamed in the hot sun, and his\nslanting grey-green eyes were mockingly bright.\n\n\u201cIf you must know,\u201d he said, \u201cI was busy drowning my sorrows on the\nnight of the big quake, two weeks ago. I didn\u2019t know anything about it\nuntil I read the papers next morning. The boss seemed to think I was a\nlittle--er--negligent.\u201d\n\nWeigal grunted. \u201cI don\u2019t wonder. A quake as bad as the \u2019Frisco one, and\nyou sleep through it! Phew!\u201d\n\nFallon grinned, and went on. About half-way down the beach a bright\nyellow bathing suit caught his eye. He whistled softly and followed it\ninto the water. After all, now that Madge was gone....\n\nHe knew the girl by sight. Fallon had an eye for blonde hair and\nDiana-esque figures. That was one thing Madge and he had fought about.\n\nThe girl swam like a mermaid. Fallon lengthened his stroke, came up\nbeside her, and said, \u201cHello.\u201d\n\nShe blinked salt water out of sapphire blue eyes and stared. \u201cI know\nyou,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re Webb Fallon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m flattered.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t be. I know a girl named Madge, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Fallon\u2019s grey-green eyes narrowed. His lean face looked suddenly\nugly, like a mean dog. Or more like a wolf, perhaps, with his thin\nstraight lips and slanting eyes.\n\n\u201cWhat did Madge tell you about me?\u201d he asked softly.\n\n\u201cShe said you were no good.\u201d The blue eyes studied his face. \u201cAnd,\u201d\nadded the girl deliberately, \u201cI think she was right.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d said Fallon, very gently. He hadn\u2019t yet got over his cold rage\nat being jilted for a dull, prosperous prig. The girl\u2019s face was like\na mask cut out of brown wood and set with hard sapphires. He made a\ntigerish, instinctive movement toward it.\n\nA wave took them unawares, knocked them together and down in a\nstruggling tangle. They broke water, gasping in the after-swirl.\n\nThen, quite suddenly, the girl screamed.\n\nIt was a short scream, strangled with sea-water, but it set the hairs\nprickling on Fallon\u2019s neck. He looked past the girl, outward.\n\nSomething was rising out of the sea.\n\n\n\nWebb Fallon, standing shoulder-deep in the cold water, stared in a\ntemporary paralysis of shock. The thing simply couldn\u2019t be.\n\nThere was a snout armed with a wicked sword. That and the head behind\nit were recognizable as those of a swordfish. But the neck behind them\nwas long and powerful, and set on sloping shoulders. Members like\nelongated fins just becoming legs churned the surface. A wholly piscine\ntail whipped up gouts of spray behind the malformed silver body.\n\nFallon moved suddenly. He grabbed the girl and started toward shore.\nThe Thing emitted a whistling grunt and surged after them.\n\nWaves struck them; the aftersuck pulled at their legs. They floundered,\nlike dreamers caught in nightmare swamps. And Fallon, through the\nthrashing and the surf and the sea-water in his ears, began to hear\nother sounds.\n\nThere was a vast stirring whisper, a waking and surging of things\ndriven up and out. There were overtones of cries from unearthly\nthroats. Presently, then, there were human screams.\n\nFallon\u2019s toes found firm sand. Still clutching the girl, he splashed\nthrough the shallows. He could hear the wallowing thunder of creatures\nbehind them, and knew that they had to run. But he faltered, staring,\nand the girl made a little choked sound beside him.\n\nThe shallow margin of the sea was churned to froth by a nightmare\nhorde. The whole broad sweep of the beach was invaded by things that,\nin that stunned moment, Fallon saw only as confused shadows.\n\nHe started to run, toward the hilly streets beyond the beach. The\ncreature with the swordfish snout was almost on them. A fish, out of\nthe sea! It reared its snaky neck and struck down.\n\nFallon dodged convulsively. The sword flashed down and buried itself in\nthe sand not five inches from his foot.\n\nIt never came out of the sand. A tail-less, stub-legged thing with\nthree rows of teeth in its shark-like jaws fastened onto the creature\u2019s\nneck, and there was hot mammalian blood spilling out.\n\nThey ran together, Fallon and the girl. The summer crowds filling\nthe beaches, the promenade, the hot-dog stands and bath-houses, were\nfighting in blind panic up the narrow streets to the top of the bluff.\nIt was useless to try to get through. Fallon made for an apartment\nhouse.\n\nBriefly, in clear, bright colors, he saw isolated scenes. A starfish\ntwenty feet across wrapping itself around a woman and her stupefied\nchild. A vast red crab pulling a man to bits with its claws. Something\nthat might once have been an octopus walking on four spidery legs, its\nremaining tentacles plucking curiously at the volley-ball net that\nbarred its way.\n\nThe din of screaming and alien cries, the roar of the crowds and the\nslippery, thrashing bodies melted into dull confusion. Fallon and the\ngirl got through, somehow, to the comparative safety of the apartment\nhouse lobby.\n\nThey found an empty place by a bay window and stopped. Fallon\u2019s legs\nwere sagging, and his heart was a leaping pain. The girl crumpled up\nagainst him.\n\nThey stared out of the window, dazed, detached, like spectators\nwatching an imaginative motion-picture and not believing it.\n\n\n\nThere was carnage outside, on the broad sunlit beach. Men and women and\nchildren died, some caught directly, others trampled down and unable to\nescape. But more than men were dying.\n\nThings fought and ate each other. Things of mad distortion of familiar\nshapes. Things unlike any living creature. Normal creatures grown out\nof all sanity. But all coming, coming, coming, like a living tidal wave.\n\nThe window went in with a crash. A woman\u2019s painted, shrieking face\nshowed briefly and was gone, pulled away by a simple marine worm grown\nlong as a man. The breeze brought Fallon the stench of blood and fish,\ndrowning the clean salt smell.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get out of here,\u201d he said. \u201cCome on.\u201d\n\nThe girl came, numbly. Neither spoke. There was, somehow, nothing to\nsay. Fallon took down a heavy metal curtain rod, holding it like a club.\n\nThe front doors had broken in. People trampled through in the blind\nstrength of terror. Fallon shrugged.\n\n\u201cNo way to get past them,\u201d he said. \u201cStay close to me. And for God\u2019s\nsake, don\u2019t fall down.\u201d\n\nThe girl\u2019s wet blonde head nodded. She took hold of the waistband of\nhis trunks, and her hand was like ice against his spine.\n\nOut through broken doors into a narrow street, and then the crowd\nspread out a little, surging up a hillside. Police sirens were\nbeginning to wail up in the town.\n\nDown below, the beaches were cleared of people. And still the things\ncame in from the sea. Fallon could see over the Santa Monica Pier now,\nand the broad sweep of sand back of the yacht harbor was black with\nsurging bodies.\n\nMost of the yachts were sunk. The bell-buoy had stopped ringing.\n\nThe sunlight was suddenly dim. Fallon looked up. His grey-green eyes\nwidened, and his teeth showed white in a snarl of fear.\n\nThundering in on queer heavy wings, their bodies hiding the sun, were\nbeasts that stopped his heart in cold terror.\n\nThey had changed, of course. The bat-like wings had been broadened\nand strengthened. They must, like the other sea-born monsters, have\ndeveloped lungs.\n\nBut the size was still there! Five to ten feet in wing-spread--and\nbehind, the thin, deadly, whip-like tails.\n\nRays! The queer creatures that fly bat-like under water--now thundering\nlike giant bats through the air!\n\nThere were flying fish wheeling round them like queer rigid birds. They\nhad grown legs like little dragons, and long tails.\n\nA pair of huge eels slid over the rough earth, pulled down a man and\nfought over the body. Policemen began to appear, and there was a\npopping of guns. The sirens made a mad skirling above the din.\n\nSome of the rays swooped to the crowded beach. Others came on, scenting\nhuman food.\n\nGuns began to crack from the cliff-tops, from the windows of apartment\nhouses. Fallon caught the chatter of sub-machine guns. One of the rays\nwas struck almost overhead.\n\nIt went out of control like a fantastic plane and crashed into the\nhillside, just behind Fallon and the girl. Men died shrieking under\nits twenty-foot, triangular bulk.\n\nIt made a convulsive leap.\n\nThe girl slipped in the loose rubble, and lost her hold on Fallon. The\nbroad tentacles on the ray\u2019s head closed in like the horns of a half\nmoon, folding the girl in a narrowing circle of death.\n\n\n\nFallon raised his iron curtain rod. He was irrationally conscious,\nwith a detached fragment of his brain, of the girl\u2019s sapphire eyes and\nthe lovely strength of her body. Her face was set with terror, but she\ndidn\u2019t scream. She fought.\n\nSomething turned over in Fallon\u2019s heart, something buried and\nunfamiliar. Something that had never stirred for Madge. He stepped in.\nThe bar swung up, slashed down.\n\nThe leathery skin split, but still the feelers hugged the girl closer.\nThe great ray heaved convulsively, and something whistled past Fallon\u2019s\nhead. It struck him across the shoulders, and laid him in dazed agony\nin the dirt.\n\nThe creature\u2019s tail, lashing like a thin long whip.\n\nWebb Fallon got up slowly. His back was numb. There was hot blood\nflooding across his skin. The girl\u2019s eyes were blue and wide, fixed on\nhim. Terribly fixed. She had stopped fighting.\n\nFallon found an eye, set back on one of the tentacles. He set the end\nof the iron rod against it, and thrust downward....\n\nWhether it was the rod, or the initial bullet, Fallon never knew, but\nthe tentacles relaxed. The girl rose and came toward him, and together\nthey went up the hill.\n\nThey were still together when sweating volunteers picked them up and\ncarried them back into the town.\n\nFallon came to before they finished sewing up his back. The emergency\nhospital was jammed. The staff worked in a kind of quiet frenzy, with\na devil\u2019s symphony of hysteria beating up against the windows of the\nwards.\n\nThey hadn\u2019t any place to keep Fallon. They taped his shoulders into a\nkind of harness to keep the wound closed, and sent him out.\n\nThe girl was waiting for him in the areaway, huddled in a blanket. They\nhad given Fallon one, too, but his cotton trunks were still clammy cold\nagainst him. He stood looking down at the girl, his short brown hair\nunkempt, the hard lines of his face showing sharp and haggard.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo thank you. You saved my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d said Fallon. \u201cNow you\u2019d better go before I\ncontaminate you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fair. I am grateful, Webb. Truly grateful.\u201d\n\nFallon would have shrugged, but it hurt. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said wearily.\n\u201cYou can tell Madge what a little hero I was.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI haven\u2019t any place to go. All\nmy clothes and money were in the apartment.\u201d\n\nHe looked at her, his eyes cold and probing. Brief disappointment\ntouched him, and he was surprised at himself. Then he went deeper, into\nthe clear sapphire eyes, and was ashamed--which surprised him even more.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd why haven\u2019t you fainted?\u201d\n\n\u201cJoan Daniels,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t had time.\u201d\n\nFallon smiled. \u201cGive me your shoulder, Joan,\u201d he said, and they went\nout.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER TWO\n\n                        Catastrophe--or Weapon?\n\n\nSanta Monica was a city under attack. Sweating policemen struggled\nwith solid jams of cars driven by wild-eyed madmen. Horns hooted and\nblared. And through it all, like banshees screaming with eldritch\nmirth, the sirens wailed.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll declare martial law,\u201d said Fallon. \u201cI wonder how long they can\nhold those things back?\u201d\n\n\u201cWebb,\u201d whispered Joan, \u201cwhat _are_ those things?\u201d\n\nStrangely, they hadn\u2019t asked that before.\n\nThey\u2019d hardly had time even to think it.\n\nFallon shook his head. \u201cGod knows. But it\u2019s going to get worse. Hear\nthat gunfire? My apartment isn\u2019t far from here. We\u2019ll get some clothes\nand a drink, and then....\u201d\n\nIt was growing dark when they came out again. Fallon felt better, with\na lot of brandy inside him and some warm clothes. Joan had a pair of\nhis slacks and a heavy sweater.\n\nHe grinned, and said, \u201cThose never looked as nice on me.\u201d\n\nSoldiers were throwing up barricades in the streets. The windows of\nCorbin\u2019s big department store were shattered, the bodies of dead rays\nlying in the debris. The rattle of gunfire was hotter, and much closer.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re being driven back,\u201d murmured Fallon.\n\nA squadron of bombers droned over, and presently there was the _crump_\nand roar of high explosives along the beaches. The streets were fairly\nclear now, except for stragglers and laden ambulances, and the thinning\ngroups of dead.\n\nFallon thought what must be happening in the towns farther south, with\ntheir flat low beaches and flimsy houses. How far did this invasion\nextend? What was it? And how long would it last?\n\nHe got his car out of the garage behind the apartment house. Joan took\nthe wheel, and he lay down on his stomach on the back seat.\n\nHis back hurt like hell.\n\n\u201cOne good thing,\u201d he remarked wryly. \u201cThe finance company won\u2019t be\nchasing me through this. Just go where the traffic looks lightest, and\nshout if you need me.\u201d\n\nHe went to sleep.\n\nIt was morning when he woke. Joan was asleep on the front seat, curled\nup under a blanket. She had spread one over him, too.\n\nFallon smiled, and looked out.\n\nThe first thing he noticed was the unfamiliar roar of motors overhead,\nand the faint crackling undertone of gunfire. They were still under\nsiege, then, and the defenders were still giving ground.\n\nThey were parked on Hollywood Boulevard near Vine. Crowds of\nwhite-faced, nervous people huddled along the streets. The only\nactivity was around the newsboys.\n\nFallon got out, stiff and cursing, and went to buy a paper. An extra\narrived before he got there. The boy ripped open the bundle, let out a\nstartled squawk, and began to yell at the top of his lungs.\n\nA low, angry roar spread down the boulevard. Fallon got a paper, and\nsmiled a white-toothed, ugly smile. He shook Joan awake and gave her\nthe paper.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s your answer. Read it.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe read aloud: \u201cJaps Claim Sea Invasion Their Secret Weapon!\n\n\u201cOnly a few minutes ago, the Amalgamated Press recorded an official\nbroadcast from Tokyo, declaring that the fantastic wave of monsters\nwhich have sprung from the ocean at many points along the Western Coast\nwas a new war-weapon of the Axis which would cause the annihilation of\nAmerican and world-wide democratic civilization.\n\n\u201cThe broadcast, an official High Command communique, said in part: \u2018The\nPacific is wholly in our hands. American naval bases throughout the\nocean are useless, and the fleet where it still exists is isolated. In\nall cases our new weapon has succeeded. The Pacific states, with the\nislands, come within our natural sphere of influence. We advise them to\nsubmit peacefully.\u2019\u201d\n\nJoan Daniels looked up at Fallon. At first there was only stunned\npallor in her face. Then the color came, dark and slow.\n\n\u201cSubmit peacefully!\u201d she whispered. \u201cSo that\u2019s it. A cowardly,\nfiendish, utterly terrible perversion of warfare--something so horrible\nthat it....\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Fallon. \u201cSave it.\u201d\n\nHe was leafing through the paper. There was a lot more--hurried\nopinions by experts, guesses, conjectures, and a few facts.\n\nFallon said flatly. \u201cThey seem to be telling the truth. Fragmentary\nradio messages have come in from the Pacific. Monsters attacked just\nas suddenly as they did here, and at about the same time. They simply\nclogged the guns, smothered the men, and wrecked ground equipment by\nsheer weight of numbers.\u201d\n\nJoan shuddered. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t think....\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d grunted Fallon. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d He flung the paper down. \u201cYah!\nNot an eyewitness account in the whole rag!\u201d\n\nJoan looked at him thoughtfully. She said, \u201cWell....\u201d\n\n\u201cThey fired me once,\u201d he snarled. \u201cWhy should I crawl back?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was your own fault, Webb. You know it.\u201d\n\nHe turned on her, and again his face had the look of a mean dog.\n\u201cThat,\u201d he said, \u201cis none of your damned business.\u201d\n\nShe faced him stubbornly, her sapphire eyes meeting his slitted\ngrey-green ones with just a hint of anger.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be a bad sort, Webb,\u201d she said steadily, \u201cif you weren\u2019t\nso lazy and so hell-fired selfish!\u201d\n\nCold rage rose in him, the rage that had shaken him when Madge told him\nshe was through. His hands closed into brown, ugly fists.\n\nJoan met him look for look, her bright hair tangling over the collar\nof his sweater, the strong brown curves of cheek and throat catching\nthe early sunlight. And again, as it had in that moment on the cliff,\nsomething turned over in Fallon\u2019s heart.\n\n\u201cWhat do you care,\u201d he whispered, \u201cwhether I am or not?\u201d\n\nFor the first time her gaze flickered, and something warmer than the\nsunlight touched her skin.\n\n\u201cYou saved my life,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel responsible for you.\u201d\n\nFallon stared. Then, quite suddenly, he laughed. \u201cYou fool,\u201d he\nwhispered. \u201cYou damned little fool!\u201d\n\nHe kissed her. And he kissed her gently, as he had never kissed Madge.\n\nThey got breakfast. After that, Fallon knew, they should have gone\neast, with the tense, crawling hordes of refugees. But somehow he\ncouldn\u2019t go. The distant gunfire drew him, the stubborn, desperate\nplanes.\n\nThey went back, toward the hills of Bel Air. After all, there was\nplenty of time to run.\n\nThings progressed as he had thought they would. Martial law was\ndeclared. An orderly evacuation of outlying towns was going forward.\nFallon got through the police lines with a glib lie about an invalid\nbrother. It wasn\u2019t hard--there was no danger yet the way he was going,\nand the police were badly overburdened.\n\nFallon kept the radio on as he drove. There was a lot of wild talk--it\nwas too early yet for censorship. A big naval battle east of Wake\nIsland, another near the Aleutians. The defense, for the present, was\ngetting nowhere.\n\nUp on the crest of a sun-seared hill, using powerful glasses from his\ncar, Fallon shook his head with a slow finality.\n\nThe morning mists were clearing. He had an unobstructed view of\nHollywood, Beverly Hills, the vast bowl of land sloping away to the\nsea. The broad boulevards to the east were clogged with solid black\nstreams. And to the west....\n\n\n\nTo the west there were barricades. There were clouds of powder smoke,\nand fleets of low-flying planes. And there was something else.\n\nSomething like a sluggish, devouring tide, lapping at the walls of the\nhuge M-G-M studios in Culver City, swamping the tarmac at Clover Field,\nflowing resistlessly on and on.\n\nBombs tore great holes in the restless sea, but they flowed in upon\nthemselves and were filled. Big guns ripped and slashed at the swarming\ncreatures. Many died. But there were always more. Many, many more.\n\nThe shallow margin of the distant ocean was still churned to froth.\nStill the things came out of it, surging up and on.\n\nFighting, spawning, dying--and advancing.\n\nJoan Daniels pressed close against him, shuddering. \u201cIt just isn\u2019t\npossible, Webb! Bombers, artillery, tanks, trained soldiers. And we\ncan\u2019t stop them!\u201d She stiffened suddenly. \u201cWebb!\u201d she cried. \u201cLook\nthere!\u201d\n\nWhere the bombers swooped through the smoke, another fleet was coming.\nA fleet of flat triangular bodies with bat-like wings, in numbers that\nclouded the sun. Rays, blind and savage and utterly uncaring.\n\nMachine guns brought them down by the hundred, but more of them came.\nThey crashed into heavy ships, fouled propellers, broke controls.\n\nJoan looked away, \u201cAnd there are so few planes,\u201d she whispered.\n\nFallon nodded. \u201cThe whole coast is under attack, remember, from\nVancouver to Mexico. There just aren\u2019t enough men, guns, or planes to\ngo round. More are coming from the east, but....\u201d He shrugged and was\nsilent.\n\n\u201cThen--then you think we\u2019ll have to surrender?\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t look hopeful, does it? Japan in control of the Pacific, and\nthis here. We\u2019ll hold out for a while, of course. But suppose these\nthings come out of the sea indefinitely?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to assume they can.\u201d Joan\u2019s eyes were dark and very tired.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s to prevent Japan from loaning her weapon to her friends? Think\nof these things swarming in over England.\u201d\n\n\u201cWar,\u201d said Fallon somberly. \u201cA hell of a long, rotten war.\u201d\n\nHe leaned against the car, his grey-green eyes half closed. The breeze\ncame in from the sea, heavy with the stench of amphibian bodies. The\nradio droned on. The single deep line between Fallon\u2019s straight brows\ngrew deeper. He began to talk, slowly, to Joan.\n\n\u201cThe experts say that the Little Brown Brothers must have some kind\nof a movable projector capable of producing rays which upset the\nevolutionary balance and cause abnormal growth. Rays like hard X-rays,\nor the cosmic rays that govern reproduction.\n\n\u201cCalifornia Tech has dissected several types of monsters. They say that\nindividual cell groups are affected, causing spontaneous growth in\nliving individuals, and that metabolism has been enormously speeded, so\nthat life-cycles which normally took years now take only a few weeks.\n\n\u201cThey also say that huge numbers--the bulk of these creatures--are\nmutants, new individuals changed in the egg or the reproductive cell.\nAll these monsters are growing and spawning at a terrific tempo.\nBillions of eggs, laid and hatched, even with the high mortality rate.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re evolving, at a fantastic rate of speed. They\u2019re growing legs\nand lungs and becoming mammals. They\u2019re coming out of the sea, just\nas our ancestors did millions of years ago. They\u2019re coming fast, and\nthey\u2019re hungry.\u201d\n\nHe fixed the girl suddenly with a bright, sharp stare.\n\n\u201cDo you think a thing as big as that is man-made?\u201d\n\n\n\nThere was a grim, stony weariness in her face. \u201cThe Japanese say so.\nWhat other explanation is there?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d said Fallon, \u201cwhy not South America, too?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were probably afraid the monsters might get out of hand and\ntackle their own people,\u201d said Joan bitterly.\n\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d Again Fallon\u2019s eyes were distant. Then he clapped his hands\nsharply and sprang up. \u201cYes! Got it, Joan!\u201d\n\nThe quick motion ripped at the wound across his back. He swayed and\ncaught her shoulder, but he didn\u2019t stop talking.\n\n\u201cEinar Bjarnsson! He was my last job. I interviewed him the day before\nthe quake. I want to see him, Joan. Now!\u201d\n\nShe took his wrists, half frightened. \u201cWhat is it, Webb?\u201d\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d he said softly. \u201cRemember the radio calls from the islands?\nThe monsters came out of the west here, didn\u2019t they? Well, out\nthere--_they came out of the east_!\u201d\n\nFallon explained, as he sent the car screaming perilously along winding\nmountain roads. Einar Bjarnsson was an expert on undersea life. He had\ncharted tide paths and sub-sea \u2018rivers,\u2019 mapped the continental shelves\nand the great deeps.\n\nBjarnsson\u2019s recent exploration had been in the Pacific, using a\nspecially constructed small submarine. His findings on deep-sea\nphenomena had occupied space in scientific journals and the Sunday\nsupplements of newspapers throughout the world.\n\nTwo days before the big quake Einar Bjarnsson returned to the place\nhe called home--a small bachelor cabin on a hilltop, crammed with\nscientific traps and trophies of his exploring. Webb Fallon drew the\nassignment of interviewing him.\n\n\u201cI was pretty sore at Madge, then,\u201d Fallon confessed, \u201cand I had a\nferocious hangover. The interview didn\u2019t go so well. But I remember\nBjarnsson mentioning something about a volcanic formation quite close\nto the Pacific coast--something nobody had noticed before. It was\napparently extinct, and the only thing that made it notable was its\nrather unusual conformation.\u201d\n\nJoan stared at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with anything?\u201d\n\nFallon shrugged. \u201cMaybe nothing. Only I recall that the epicenter of\nthe recent quake was somewhere in the vicinity of Bjarnsson\u2019s volcano.\nI remember that damned quake quite well, because it cost me my job.\u201d\n\nJoan opened her mouth and closed it again, hard. Fallon grinned.\n\n\u201cYou were going to tell me it wasn\u2019t the quake, but my own bad\ncharacter,\u201d he said mockingly.\n\nThere was something grim in the upthrust lines of her jaw. \u201cI can\u2019t\nmake you out, Webb,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cSometimes I think there\u2019s good\nstuff in you--and then I think Madge was right!\u201d\n\nFallon\u2019s dark oval face went ugly, and he didn\u2019t speak again until\nBjarnsson\u2019s house came in sight.\n\n\n\n\n                             CHAPTER THREE\n\n                         Bjarnsson\u2019s Submarine\n\n\nFallon stopped the car and got out stiffly, feeling suddenly tired and\ndisinterested. He hesitated. Why bother with a crazy hunch? The rolling\ncrash of gunfire was getting closer. Why not forget the whole thing and\ngo while the going was good?\n\nHe realized that Joan was watching him with sapphire eyes grown puzzled\nand hard. \u201cDamn it!\u201d he snarled. \u201cStop looking at me as though I were a\nbug under glass!\u201d\n\nJoan said, \u201cIs that Bjarnsson in the doorway?\u201d\n\nFor the third time Fallon\u2019s hands clenched in anger. Then he turned\nsharply, white about the lips with the pain it cost him, and strode up\nto the small rustic cabin.\n\nEinar Bjarnsson remembered him. He stood aside, a tall stooped man with\nmassive shoulders and a gaunt, cragged face. Coarse fair hair shot\nwith grey hung in his eyes, which were small and the color of frozen\nsea-water.\n\nHe said, in a deep, slow voice, \u201cCome in. I have been watching through\nmy telescope. Most interesting. But it gets too close now. I am\nsurprised you are here. Duty to your paper, eh?\u201d\n\nFallon let it pass. He might get more out of Bjarnsson if the explorer\nthought he was still with the _Observer_. And then the thought struck\nhim--what was he going to do if his hunch was right?\n\nNothing. He had no influence. The statesmen were handling things.\nSuppose Japan did take the Pacific States? Suppose there was a war? He\ncouldn\u2019t do anything about it. Let the big boys worry. There\u2019d be a\nbeach somewhere that he could comb in peace.\n\nHe made a half turn to go out again. Then he caught sight of a map on\nthe far wall--a map of the Pacific.\n\nSomething took him to it. He put his finger on a spot north and east of\nthe Hawaiian Islands. And even then he couldn\u2019t have said why he asked\nhis question.\n\n\u201cYour volcanic formation was about here, wasn\u2019t it, Bjarnsson?\u201d\n\nThe tall Norseman stared at him with cold shrewd eyes. \u201cYes. Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook here.\u201d Fallon drew a rough circle with his fingertip, touching\nthe Pacific Coast, swinging across the ocean through the Gilberts and\nthe Marshalls, touching Wake, and curving up again to Vancouver.\n\n\u201cThe volcanic formation is the center of that circle,\u201d Fallon said.\n\u201cIt was also the epicenter of the recent quake, according to Cal-Tech\nseismologists. That\u2019s what gave me the hunch. The monsters seem to be\nfanning out in a circle from some central point located about there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is already explained,\u201d said Bjarnsson. \u201cThe Japanese may have\ntheir projector located there. And why not?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo reason at all,\u201d Fallon admitted. \u201cYou mentioned, in your interview,\nsomething about a Japanese ocean survey ship coming up just as you\nleft. That ship might still have been near there at the time of the\nquake, mightn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is possible. Go on.\u201d There was a little sharp flame flickering in\nBjarnsson\u2019s eyes.\n\nFallon said, \u201cCould these super-evolutionary rays be caused by volcanic\naction?\u201d\n\nBjarnsson\u2019s grey-blond shaggy brows met, and the flame was sharper in\nhis eyes. \u201cFantastic. But so is this whole affair.... Yes! If an area\nof intense radioactivity were uncovered by an earth-shift, the sea and\nall that swims in it might be affected.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d Fallon\u2019s lips were drawn in a tight grin. \u201cSuppose the officers\nof the Japanese ship saw the beginnings of the effect. Suppose they\nradioed home, and someone did some quick thinking. Suppose, in short,\nthat they\u2019re lying.\u201d\n\n\u201c_Ja_,\u201d whispered Bjarnsson. \u201cLet us think.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already thought,\u201d said Fallon. \u201cTwo weeks would give them time\nto arrange everything. The important thing is this--if the force is\nman-made, even destroying the projector won\u2019t do any good. They\u2019ll\nhave others. But if it were a natural force, the psychological aspect\nof the thing alone would be tremendous. There\u2019d be a chance of doing\nsomething.\u201d\n\nThe explorer\u2019s deep light eyes glinted. \u201cOur people would fight better\nif it was something they _could_ fight.\u201d He swung to the big telescope\nmounted in the west windows. \u201cBah! It gets worse. Those creatures, they\ndon\u2019t know when they are dead. And the way they come! We must go soon.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe swung back to Fallon. \u201cBut how to find out if you are right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a submarine,\u201d said Fallon.\n\n\u201cSo has the Navy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they\u2019re all needed. Yours can go where the big ones can\u2019t--and\ngo deeper. These monsters are all heading for land, which means they\ngravitate to the surface. You might get through below.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Bjarnsson strode up and down the cluttered room. \u201cWe could take\na depth charge. If we found the volcano to be the cause, we might close\nthe fissure.\n\n\u201cTime, Fallon! That is the thing. A few days, a few weeks, and the\nsheer pressure of these hordes will have forced the defenders back to\nthe mountains and the deserts. Civilian morale will break.\u201d\n\nHe stopped, making a sharp gesture of futility. \u201cI am forgetting. The\nradiations, Fallon. Without proper insulation, we would evolve like the\nsea-things. And it would take many days to make lead armor for us, even\nif we could get anyone to do the work.\u201d\n\n\u201cRadiations,\u201d said Fallon slowly. \u201cYeah. I\u2019d forgotten that. Well, that\nstops that. Projector or volcano, you\u2019d never reach it.\u201d\n\nHe brushed a hand across his eyes, all his brief enthusiasm burned\naway. He was getting like that. He wished he had a drink.\n\n\u201cProbably all moonshine, anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyhow, there\u2019s nothing we\ncan do about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing!\u201d Joan Daniels spoke so sharply that both men started. \u201cYou\nmean you\u2019re not even going to try?\u201d\n\n\u201cBjarnsson can pass the idea along for what it\u2019s worth.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what that means, Webb! The idea would be either laughed at or\npigeonholed, especially with the Jap propagandists doing such a good\njob. The government\u2019s got a war on its hands. Even if someone did pay\nattention, nothing would be done until too late. It never is.\u201d\n\nShe gripped his arms, looking up at him with eyes like sea-blue swords.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a bare chance of saving them, Webb, you\u2019ve got to take it!\u201d\n\nFallon looked down at her, his wolf\u2019s eyes narrowed.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a fiction hero. We\u2019ve got an Army, a Navy,\nan air force, and a secret service. They\u2019re getting paid for risking\ntheir necks. Let them worry. I had a hunch, which may not be worth a\ndime. I passed it along. Now I\u2019m going to clear out, before anything\nmore happens to me.\u201d\n\nJoan\u2019s face was cut, sharp and bitter, from brown wood. Her eyes had\nfire in them, way back.\n\n\u201cYour logic,\u201d she whispered, \u201cis flawless.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saved your life,\u201d said Fallon brutally. \u201cWhat more do you want?\u201d\n\nThe color drained from the brown wood, leaving it marble. Only the\nangry fires in her eyes lived, in the pale hard stone.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re remembering how I kissed you,\u201d said Fallon, so softly that he\nhardly spoke at all. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I did. I don\u2019t know why I came\nhere. I don\u2019t know....\u201d\n\nHe stopped and turned to the door. Bjarnsson, very quietly, was picking\nup the phone. Fallon took the knob and turned it.\n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d said a quiet, sibilant voice. \u201cYou cannot leave. And you,\nsir--put down that telephone.\u201d\n\n\n\nA small neat man with a yellow face stood on the threshold. He was\nholding a small, neat, efficient-looking automatic. Fallon backed into\nthe room, hearing the click of the cradle as the phone went down.\n\n\u201cYou are Einar Bjarnsson?\u201d The question was toneless and purely\nrhetorical. The black eyes had seen the whole room in one swift flick.\n\u201cI am Kashimo,\u201d said the man, and waited.\n\n\u201cFallon,\u201d Webb said easily. \u201cThis is Miss Daniels. We just dropped in\nfor a chat. Mind if we go now?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am afraid ...\u201d said Kashimo, and spread his hands. \u201cI have been\ndiscourteous enough to eavesdrop. You have an inventive mind, Mr.\nFallon. An inaccurate mind, but one that might prove disturbing to our\nplans.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d grunted Fallon. \u201cI have no business whatsoever, and I\nattend to it closely. Your plans don\u2019t matter to me at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d Kashimo studied him with black, bright eyes. \u201cYou are either\na liar or a disgrace to your country, Mr. Fallon. But I may not take\nchances. You and the young lady I must, sadly, cancel out.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I?\u201d Bjarnsson asked.\n\n\u201cYou come with us,\u201d said Kashimo. Fallon saw four other small neat men\noutside, close behind their leader in the doorway.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018cancel out\u2019?\u201d He knew, before Kashimo\nmoved his automatic.\n\nKashimo said, \u201cMr. Bjarnsson, please to move out of the line of fire.\u201d\n\nNo one moved. The room was still, except for Joan\u2019s quick-caught\nbreath. And then motion beyond the west windows caught Fallon\u2019s eye. A\ncolder fear crawled in his heart, but his voice surprised him, it was\nso steady.\n\n\u201cKashimo. Look out there.\u201d\n\nThe bright black eyes flicked warily aside. They widened sharply, and\nthe cords went slack about the jaw. Fallon sprang.\n\nHe had forgotten the wound across his back. The shock of his body\nstriking Kashimo turned him sick and faint. He knew that the little man\nfell, staggering the others so close behind him.\n\nHe knew that Joan Daniels was shouting, and that Bjarnsson had caught\nup an ebony war-club and was using it. Shots boomed in his ears. But\none sound kept him from fainting--the thunder of slow relentless giant\nwings.\n\nHe got up in unsteady darkness. A round sallow face appeared. He struck\nat it. Bone cracked under his knuckles, and the face vanished. Fallon\nfound a wall and clung to it.\n\nHands gripped his ankle--Kashimo\u2019s hands. Bjarnsson was outside mopping\nup. Fallon braced himself and drew his foot back. His toe caught\nKashimo solidly under the angle of the jaw.\n\n\u201cJoan,\u201d said Fallon. The wings were thundering closer. Joan didn\u2019t\nanswer. A sort of queer panic filled Fallon.\n\n\u201cJoan!\u201d he cried. \u201cJoan!\u201d\n\n\u201cHere I am, Webb.\u201d She came from beyond the door, with a heavy little\nidol in her hand. It had blood on it. Her golden hair was tumbled and\nher neck was bleeding where a bullet had creased it.\n\nFallon caught her. He felt her wince under his hands. He didn\u2019t know\nquite what he wanted, except that she must be safe.\n\nHe only said, \u201cHurry, before those things get here.\u201d\n\nThe throb of wings was deafening. Bjarnsson came in, swinging his club.\nHis cragged face was bloody, but his pale eyes blazed.\n\n\u201cGood man, Fallon,\u201d he grunted. \u201cAll right, let\u2019s go. There\u2019s a cave\nbelow here. Take their guns, young lady. We\u2019ll need them.\u201d\n\nThe sky beyond the west windows was clogged with huge black shapes.\nFallon remembered the smashed windows of the department store in Santa\nMonica. \u201cJoan,\u201d he said, \u201ccome here.\u201d\n\nHe put his arm around her shoulders. He might have walked all right\nwithout her, but somehow he wanted her there.\n\n\n\nThey dropped down the other side of the hill into a little brush-choked\ncleft. There was a shallow cave at one end.\n\n\u201cThere go my windows,\u201d said Bjarnsson, and cursed in Swedish. \u201cIn with\nyou, before those flying devils find us.\u201d\n\nThey were well hidden. Chances were the rays would go right over\nthem--after they\u2019d finished off Kashimo and his men. Bjarnsson said\nsoftly, \u201cWhat did they want with me, Fallon?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one thing they couldn\u2019t get from somebody else,\u201d returned\nFallon. \u201cYour submarine.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. The mechanisms are of my own design. They would need me to\noperate it. Does that mean we are right about the volcano?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe. They\u2019d have made plans to control it, of course. Or they may\nwant your ship merely as a model.\u201d\n\nThere was silence for a while. Outside, heavy wings began to beat\nagain. They came perilously low, went over, and were gone.\n\nEinar Bjarnsson said quietly, \u201cI\u2019m going to take the chance, Fallon.\nI\u2019m going to try to get my ship through.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about the radiations?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Kashimo was planning to use the ship, he\u2019ll have arranged for that.\nAnyway, I\u2019m going to see.\u201d His ice-blue eyes stabbed at Fallon. \u201cI\ncan\u2019t do it alone.\u201d\n\nJoan Daniels said, \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d\n\nBjarnsson\u2019s eyes flicked from one to the other. Fallon\u2019s face was dark\nand almost dangerous.\n\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d he said gently.\n\nJoan faced him. \u201cI thought you were going away.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind.\u201d Looking at her, at her blue, unsympathetic\neyes, Fallon wondered if he really had. Perhaps the stunning shock of\nall that had happened had unsettled him.\n\nJoan put both hands on his shoulders and looked straight into his eyes.\n\u201cWhat kind of a man are you, Webb Fallon?\u201d\n\n\u201cGod knows,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere do you keep your boat, Bjarnsson?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a private steel-and-concrete building at Wilmington. Some of the\nimprovements are of interest to certain people. I keep them locked\nsafely away. Or so I thought.\u201d\n\nFallon rose stiffly. \u201cKashimo didn\u2019t come in a car, that\u2019s certain.\nHe\u2019d have been arrested on sight. Any place for a plane to land near\nhere?\u201d\n\nThe explorer shook his head. \u201cUnless it could come straight down.\u201d\n\nFallon snapped his finger. \u201cA helicopter! That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nHe led the way out. They found the \u2019copter on a small level space\nbeyond the shoulder of the hill. Fallon nodded.\n\n\u201cIngenious little chaps. The ship\u2019s painted like an Army plane. Any\npilot would think it was a special job and let it severely alone.\u201d He\nturned abruptly to Joan.\n\n\u201cTake my car,\u201d he told her. \u201cGet away from here, fast. Find someone in\nauthority and make him listen--just in case.\u201d\n\nShe nodded. \u201cWebb, why are you going?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause there isn\u2019t time to get anyone else,\u201d he told her roughly.\n\u201cBecause there\u2019s a story there....\u201d\n\nHe stopped, startled at what he had said. \u201cYes,\u201d he said slowly, \u201ca\nstory. My story. Oh hell, why did you have to come along?\u201d\n\nHe put his hands suddenly back of her head and tilted her face up, his\nfingers buried in the warm curls at the base of her neck.\n\n\u201cI was all set,\u201d he whispered savagely. \u201cI knew all the answers. And\nthen you showed up. If you hadn\u2019t, I\u2019d be half-way to Miami by now. I\u2019d\nstill be sure of myself. I wouldn\u2019t be so damned confused, thinking one\nway and feeling another....\u201d\n\nShe kissed him suddenly, warmly. \u201cI\u2019ll make somebody listen,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAnd then I\u2019ll wait--and pray.\u201d\n\nThen she was gone. In a minute he heard the car start.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d he snarled at Bjarnsson. \u201cI remember you said you fly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                             CHAPTER FOUR\n\n                         A Dead Man Comes Back\n\n\nIt was a nightmare trip. The battle below was terribly clear. Twice\nthey dodged flights of the giant rays, saved only because the scent of\nfood kept the attention of the brutes on the ground.\n\nThe harbor basin at Wilmington was choked with slippery, struggling\nbeasts. There was hardly a sign of shipping. Bjarnsson made for the\nflat top of a square building, completely surrounded.\n\nA flight of rays went over just as they landed. A trap door in the roof\nraised and was slammed shut again.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Fallon grimly, and jumped out.\n\nThey were almost to the trap when a ray sighted them. Fallon shot it\nthrough the eye, but others followed. Bjarnsson wrenched up the trap. A\nsurprised yellow face peered up, vanished in a crimson smear.\n\nBjarnsson hauled the body out and threw it as far as he could. The rays\nfought over it like monstrous gulls over a fish head.\n\nFallen retched and followed Bjarnsson down.\n\nThere were three other men in the building. One tried to shoot it out\nand was killed. The others were mechanics, with no stomachs for the\nguns.\n\nThey looked over the sub, a small stubby thing of unusual design, and\nBjarnsson nodded his gaunt shaggy head.\n\n\u201cThese suits of leaded fabric,\u201d he said. \u201cOne big, for me. The other\nsmaller, for Kashimo, perhaps. Can you get into it?\u201d\n\nFallon grunted. \u201cI guess so. Hey! Look there.\u201d\n\n\u201cHa! A depth charge, held in the claws I use for picking specimens from\nthe ocean floor. They have prepared well, Fallon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what that means!\u201d Fallon was aware of a forgotten, surging\nexcitement. His palms came together with a ringing crack.\n\n\u201cI was right! Kashimo was going to hold you here until the Government\ncapitulated. Then he was going out to shut off the power. There\u2019s\nno projector, Bjarnsson. It _was_ the volcano. If we can close that\nfissure while there\u2019s still resistance, we\u2019ll have \u2019em licked!\u201d\n\nBjarnsson\u2019s ice-blue eyes fixed Fallon with a sharp, unwavering stare,\nand he spoke slowly, calmly, almost without expression.\n\n\u201cIt will take about three days to get there, working together. One fit\nof cowardice or indecision, one display of nerves or temper may destroy\nwhat slight chance we have.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean,\u201d said Fallon, \u201cyou wish you had someone you could depend\non.\u201d He smiled crookedly. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best, Bjarnsson.\u201d\n\nThey struggled into the clumsy lead armor and shuffled into the small\ncontrol room of the submarine. Everything had been prepared in advance.\nIn a few seconds, automatic machinery was lowering the sub into its\nslip.\n\nWater slapped the hull. Bjarnsson started the motors. They went forward\nslowly, through doors that opened electrically.\n\nBallast hissed and snarled into the tanks.\n\nBjarnsson said, \u201cIf we can get through this first pack, into deep\nwater, we may make it.\u201d He pointed to a knife-switch. \u201cPull it.\u201d\n\nFallon did. Nothing seemed to happen. Bjarnsson sat hunched over the\ncontrols, cold blue eyes fixed on the periscope screen. Fallon had a\nswift, horrible sense of suffocation--the steel wall of the sub curving\nlow over his helmeted head, the surge of huge floundering bodies in the\nwater outside.\n\nSomething struck the hull. The little ship canted. Fallon gripped his\nseat with rigid, painful hands. Bjarnsson\u2019s armored, unhuman shoulders\nmoved convulsively with effort. Fallon felt a raw panic scream rising\nin his throat....\n\n\n\nHe choked it back. Heavy muffled blows shook the submarine. The motors\nchurned and shook. Fallon was afraid they were going to stop. Sweat\ndripped in his eyes, misted his helmet pane.\n\nThe screws labored on. Fallon heard the tanks filling, and knew that\nthey were going deeper. The blows on the hull grew fewer, farther\nbetween. Fallon began to breath again.\n\nEinar Bjarnsson relaxed, just a little. His voice came muffled by his\nhelmet. \u201cThe worst, Fallon--we\u2019re through it.\u201d\n\nFallon\u2019s throat was as dry as his face was wet. \u201cBut how?\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes, in the deeps, one meets creatures. Hungry creatures, as\nlarge even as this ship. So I prepared the hull. That switch transforms\nus into a travelling electric shock, strong enough to discourage almost\nanything. I hoped it would get us through.\u201d\n\nThinking of what might have happened, Fallon shut his jaw hard. His\nvoice was unnaturally steady as he asked, \u201cWhat now?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow you learn to operate the ship, in case something should happen to\nme.\u201d Bjarnsson\u2019s small blue eyes glinted through his helmet pane. \u201cToo\nbad there is not a radio here, Fallon, so that you might broadcast as\nwe go. As it is, I fear the world may miss a very exciting story.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor God\u2019s sake,\u201d said Fallon wearily, and he wasn\u2019t swearing. \u201cLet\u2019s\nnot make this any tougher. Okay. This is the master switch....\u201d\n\nIn the next twenty-four hours, Fallon learned to handle the submarine\npassably well. Built for a crew of two, the controls were fairly\nsimple, once explained. Nothing else was touched. The only extra switch\nthat mattered was the one that released the depth charge.\n\nFor an endless, monotonous hell, Fallon stood watch and watch about\nwith Bjarnsson, one at the controls, one operating the battery\nof observation \u2019scopes, never sleeping. They saved on oxygen as\na precaution, which added to the suffocating discomfort of the\nhelmet-filters.\n\nBlack, close, nerve-rasping hours crawled by, became days. At last,\nFallon, bent over the \u2019scope screen, licked the sweat from his thin\nlips and looked at Bjarnsson, a blurred dark hulk against the dim glow\nof the half-seen instrument panel.\n\nFallon\u2019s head ached. The hot stale air stank of oil. His body was tired\nand cramped and sweat-drenched, and the wound across his shoulders\nthrobbed. He looked at the single narrow bunk.\n\nThere was nothing out there in the water but darkness. Even the\ndeep-sea fish had felt the impulse and avoided the sub. Fallon got up.\n\n\u201cBjarnsson,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d\n\nThe explorer half turned in his seat.\n\n\u201c_Ja?_\u201d he said quietly.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing out there,\u201d growled Fallon. \u201cWhy should I sit and\nglare at that periscope?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d Bjarnsson returned with ominous gentleness, \u201cthere might be\nsomething. We will not reach the volcano for perhaps ten hours. You had\nbetter watch.\u201d\n\nFallon\u2019s hard jaw set. \u201cI can\u2019t go any longer without sleep.\u201d\n\nBjarnsson\u2019s cragged face was flushed and greasy behind his helmet, but\nhis eyes were like glittering frost.\n\n\u201cAll the whisky and the women,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThey make you soft,\nFallon. The girl would have been better.\u201d\n\nA flashing glimpse of Joan as she had looked in the car that morning\ncrossed the eye of Fallon\u2019s mind--the tumbled fair hair and the\nsunlight warm on throat and cheek, and her voice saying, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t\nbe bad, Webb ... so lazy and so hell-fired selfish!\u201d\n\nHe cursed and started forward. The dark blur of Bjarnsson rose,\nblotting out the green glow. And then the panel light rose in a\nshuddering arc.\n\nFallon thought for a moment that he was fainting. The low curve of the\nhull spun about. He knew that he fell, and that he struck something,\nor that something struck him. All orientation was lost. His helmet\nrang against metal like a great gong, and then he was sliding down a\ncluttered slope.\n\nA blunt projection ripped across his back. Even through the leaded\nsuit, the pain of it made him scream. He heard the sound as a distant,\nthrottled echo. Then even the dim green light was gone.\n\n\n\nThe screen flickered abominably. It showed mostly a blurred mob of\npeople, trampling back and forth. Then it steadied and there was a\npicture, in bright, gay colors.\n\nA starfish twenty feet across wrapping itself around a woman and her\nstupefied child.\n\n\u201cWe saw that,\u201d said Fallon. \u201cOn the beach. Remember?\u201d\n\nHe thought Joan answered, but there was another picture. A vast red\ncrab, pulling a man to bits with its claws. And after that, the\nshrieking woman outside the broken window, dragged down by a worm.\n\n\u201cWonder who got those shots?\u201d said Fallon. Again Joan answered, but he\ndidn\u2019t hear her. The pictures moved more rapidly. Rays, black against\nthe blue sky. Planes falling. Guns firing and firing and choking to\nsilence. People, black endless streams of them, running, running,\nrunning.\n\nJoan pulled at him. Her face was strangely huge. Her eyes were as he\nhad first seen them, hard chips of sapphire. And at last he heard what\nshe was saying.\n\n\u201cYour fault, Webb Fallon. This might have been stopped. But you had to\nsleep. You couldn\u2019t take it. You\u2019re no good, Webb. No good. No good....\u201d\n\nHer voice faded, mixed somehow with a deep throbbing noise. \u201cJoan!\u201d he\nshouted. \u201cJoan!\u201d But her face faded too. The last he could see was her\neyes, hard and steady and deeply blue.\n\n\u201cJoan,\u201d he whispered. There was a sound in his head like the tearing of\nsilk, a sensation of rushing upward. Then he was quite conscious, his\nface pressed forward against his helmet and his body twisted, bruised\nand painful.\n\nThe first thing he saw was Einar Bjarnsson sprawled on the floor\nplates. A sharp point of metal had ripped his suit from neck to waist,\nlaying his chest bare.\n\nFor a moment of panic horror, Fallon sought for tears in his own suit.\nThere were none. He relaxed with a sob of relief, and looked up at the\nlow curve of the hull.\n\nIt was still whole. Fallon shuddered. What product of abnormal\nevolution had attacked them in the moment that he had looked away?\nStrange he hadn\u2019t seen it coming, before.\n\nThe dim, still bulk of Einar Bjarnsson drew his gaze. Crouched there\non his knees, it seemed to Fallon that the whole universe drew in and\ncentered on that motionless body.\n\n\u201cI killed him,\u201d Fallon whispered. \u201cI looked away. I might have seen the\nthing in time, but I looked away. I killed him.\u201d\n\nFor a long time he couldn\u2019t move. Then, like the swift stroke of a\nknife, terror struck him.\n\nHe was alone under the sea.\n\nHe got up. The chronometer showed an elapsed time of nearly two hours.\nThe course, held by an Iron Mike, was steady. The beast that had\nattacked them must have lost interest.\n\nFallon clung to a stanchion and thought, harder than he had ever\nthought in his life.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t go on by himself. There had to be two men, to gauge\ndistances, spot the best target, control the sub in the resultant\nblast. Why couldn\u2019t he forget the volcano? There were lots of islands\nin the Pacific, beyond the affected sphere.\n\nHe could stay drunk on palm wine as well as Scotch.\n\nHe\u2019d never see Joan again, of course. Joan, accusing, hard-eyed,\ncontemptuous. Joan, condemning him for murder....\n\nFallon laughed, a sharp, harsh bark. \u201cJoan, hell! That was my own mind,\ncondemning me!\u201d\n\n\n\nHis gaze went back to Bjarnsson\u2019s body, rolling slightly with the\nmotion of the ship. It boiled down to that. Murder. His careless,\nselfish murder of Bjarnsson. The murder of countless civilians. War,\nbitter, brutal, desperate.\n\nFallon drew a long, shuddering breath. His head dropped forward in his\nhelmet, and his slanting wolf\u2019s eyes were closed. Then he turned and\nsat down at the controls.\n\nThe single forward \u2019scope field gave him vision enough to steer.\nAnything might attack from the sides or the stern--another beast grown\nincredibly huge, but not yet a lung breather.\n\nAlone, he probably wouldn\u2019t succeed. He wouldn\u2019t live to know whether\nhe had or not. His gloved hands clenched over the levers that would\nchange the course, send him away to safety.\n\nSavagely he forced his hands away. He gripped the wheel. Time slid by\nhim, black and silent as the water outside. And then....\n\nSomething moved in the dark behind him.\n\nSlowly, slowly, Fallon rose and turned. The veins of his lean face were\nlike knotted cords. The hard steel of the hull held him, tight and\nclose, smothering.\n\nBlurred, faint movement. The soft scrape of metal against metal. He had\nbeen so sure Bjarnsson was dead. He\u2019d been dazed and sick, he hadn\u2019t\nlooked closely. But he\u2019d been sure. Bjarnsson, lying so still, with his\nsuit ripped open.\n\n_His suit ripped open._ Volcanic rays would be seeping into his flesh.\nRays of change--perhaps they even brought the dead to life.\n\nThere was a grating clang, and suddenly Fallon screamed, a short choked\nsound that hurt his throat.\n\nBjarnsson\u2019s face looked at him. Bjarnsson\u2019s face, with every gaunt\nbone, every vein and muscle and convolution of the brain traced in\nlines of cold white fire.\n\nThe shrouding leaden suit slipped from wide, stooped shoulders. The\nheart beat in pulses of flame within the glowing cage of the ribs.\nThe coil and flow of muscles in arm and thigh was a living, beautiful\nrhythm of light.\n\n\u201cFallon,\u201d said Einar Bjarnsson. \u201cTurn back.\u201d\n\nThe remembered voice, coming from that glowing, pulsing throat, was the\nmost horrible thing of all.\n\nFallon licked the cold sweat from his lips. \u201cNo,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTurn back, or you will be killed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d whispered Fallon. \u201cI\u2019ve got to try.\u201d\n\nBjarnsson laughed. Fallon could see his diaphragm contract in a surge\nof flame, see the ripple of the laughter.\n\nA wave of anger cut across Fallon\u2019s terror, cold and sane.\n\n\u201cI did this to you, Bjarnsson,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to make up for it.\nI thought you were dead. Perhaps, if you put your armor back on, we can\npatch it up somehow, and it may not be too late.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it is too late. So, you blame yourself, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cI left my post. Otherwise, you might have dodged that thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cDodged it?\u201d Tiny sparkles of light shot through Bjarnsson\u2019s brain.\n\u201cOh, _ja_. Perhaps.\u201d And he laughed again. \u201cSo you will not turn back?\nNot even for the beautiful Joan?\u201d\n\nFallon\u2019s eyes closed, but the lines of his jaw were stern with anger.\n\u201cDo you have to torture me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d said Bjarnsson. \u201cWait a little. Then I will know.\u201d\n\n\n\nHis voice was suddenly strange. Fallon opened his eyes. The glowing\nfire in the explorer\u2019s body was growing brighter, so that it blurred\nthe lines of vein and bone and sinew.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Bjarnsson. \u201cNo need for torture. Turn back, Fallon.\u201d\n\nGod, how he wanted to! \u201cNo,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve got to try.\u201d\n\nBjarnsson\u2019s voice came to him, almost as an echo.\n\n\u201cWe were fools, Fallon. Fools to think that we could stop this thing\nwith a single puny bomb. Kashimo was a fool, too, but he was a gambler.\nBut we, Fallon, you and I--we were the bigger fools.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe kind of fools,\u201d said Fallon doggedly, \u201cthat men have always been.\nAnd damn it, I think I\u2019d rather be the fool I am than the smart guy I\nwas!\u201d\n\nBjarnsson\u2019s laughter echoed in his helmet. Fallon had a moment\u2019s eerie\nfeeling that he heard with his brain instead of his ears.\n\n\u201cWonderful, Fallon, wonderful! You see how circumstance makes us\ntraitors to ourselves? But there is no need for heroics. You can turn\nback, Fallon.\u201d\n\nThe lines of Bjarnsson\u2019s body were quite gone. He loomed against the\ndarkness as a pillar of shining mist. Fallon\u2019s weary eyes were dazzled\nwith it.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he muttered stubbornly. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nBjarnsson\u2019s voice rolled in on him suddenly, soul-shaking as an organ.\n\nVoice--or mind? A magnificent, thundering strength.\n\n\u201cThis is evolution, Fallon. So shall we be, a million million years\nfrom now. This is living, Fallon. It is godhood! Take off your suit,\nFallon! Grow with me!\u201d\n\n\u201cJoan,\u201d said Fallon wearily. \u201cJoan, dearest.\u201d\n\nCosmic laughter, shuddering in his mind. And then,\n\n\u201cTurn back, Fallon. In an hour it will be too late.\u201d\n\nThe shining mist was dimming, drawing in upon itself. And at the core,\na tiny light was growing, a frosty white flame that seared Fallon\u2019s\nbrain.\n\n\u201cTurn back! Turn back!\u201d\n\nHe fought, silently. But the light and the voice poured into him.\nAbruptly, something in him relaxed. He\u2019d been so long without rest.\n\nHe knew, very dimly, that he turned and changed the course, back toward\nthe coast of California.\n\n\n\nFrom somewhere, out of the gulfs between the stars, a voice spoke to\nhim as he lay sprawled across the control panel.\n\n\u201cThere was no need for you to die, Fallon. Now, I can see much. It\nwas no monster that struck us, but the first shock of a series of\nquakes, which will close the fissure far better than any human agency.\nTherefore, what happened to me was not your fault.\n\n\u201cAnd I am glad it happened. I, Bjarnsson, was growing old, I had\nnothing but science to hold me to Earth. Now my knowledge is boundless,\nand I am not confined by the fetters of the flesh. I am Mind--as some\nday we will all be.\n\n\u201cYou will be safe, Fallon. The invasion will fail as the power is shut\noff, and America can deal with any further dangers. Marry Joan, and be\nhappy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about myself, yet. The possibilities are too vast to be\nexplored in a minute. I am not dead, Fallon. Remember that! But--\u201d and,\nhere Fallon heard an echo of Bjarnsson\u2019s harsh, mocking laughter--\u201cif\nyou should ever cease to be a fool and become again a smart guy, I\nshall find a way to send you back along evolution, to a stupid ape!\n\n\u201cI go now, Fallon. _Skoal!_ And will you name your first-born Einar? I\ncan see that it will be a son!\u201d",
