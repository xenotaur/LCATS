    "body": "On his first day as a mail carrier, Sam Wilson noted that inscription,\ncribbed from Herodotus, on the General Post Office, and took it to\nheart: \"Not snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night stays these\ncouriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.\"\n\nIt couldn't be literally true, of course. Given a real blizzard, it\nwould be impossible to make his way through the pathless drifts; and\nif there had been a major flood, he could hardly have swum to deliver\nletters to the marooned. Moreover, if he couldn't find the addressee,\nthere was nothing to do but mark the envelope \"Not known at this\naddress,\" and take it back to be returned to the addresser or consigned\nto the Dead Letter Office. But through the years, Sam Wilson had been\nas consciously faithful and efficient as any Persian messenger.\n\nNow the long years had galloped by, and this was the very last time he\nwould walk his route before his retirement.\n\nIt would be good to put his feet up somewhere and ease them back into\ncomfort; they had been Sam's loyal servants and they were more worn\nout than he was. But the thought of retirement bothered him. Mollie\nwas going to get sick of having him around the house all day, and he\nwas damned if he was going to sit on a park bench like other discarded\nold men and suck a pipe and stare at nothing, waiting for the hours to\npass in a vacuum. He had his big interest, of course--his status as a\ndevoted science fiction fan; he would have time now to read and reread,\nto watch hopefully from the roof of his apartment house for signs of a\nflying saucer. But that wasn't enough; what he needed was a project to\nkeep him alert and occupied.\n\nOn his last delivery he found it.\n\nThe Ochterlonie Building, way down on lower Second Avenue, was a\nrundown, shabby old firetrap, once as solid as the Scotsman who had\nbuilt it and named it for himself, but now, with its single open-cage\nelevator and its sagging floors, attracting only quack doctors and\ndubious private eyes and similar fauna on the edge of free enterprise.\nSam had been delivering to it now for 35 years, watching its slow\ndeterioration.\n\nThis time there was a whole batch of self-addressed letters\nfor a tenant whose name was new to him, but that was hardly\nsurprising--nowadays, in the Ochterlonie Building, tenants came and\nwent.\n\nThey were small envelopes, addressed in blue, in printing simulating\nhandwriting, to Orville K. Hesterson, Sec.-Treas., Time-Between-Time,\n746 Ochterlonie Building, New York 3, N. Y. Feeling them with\nexperienced fingers, Sam Wilson judged they were orders for something,\ndoubtless enclosing money.\n\n\n\nIn most of the buildings on his last route, Sam knew, at least by\nsight, the employees who took in the mail, and they knew him. A lot\nof them knew this was his last trip; there were farewells and good\nwishes, and even a few small donations (since he wouldn't be there\nnext Christmas) which he gratefully tucked in an inside pocket of the\nuniform he would never wear again. There were also two or three\ninvitations to a drink, which, being still on duty, he had regretfully\nto decline.\n\nBut in the Ochterlonie Building, with its fly-by-night clientele, he\nwas just the postman, and nobody greeted him except Howie Mallory, the\ndecrepit elevator operator. Sam considered him soberly. It was going to\nbe pretty tough financially from now on; could he, perhaps, find a job\nlike Howie's? No. Not unless things got a lot tougher; standing all day\nwould be just as bad as walking.\n\nHe went from office to office, getting rid of his load--mostly bills,\nduns and complaints, he imagined, in this hole. There was nothing for\nthe seventh floor except this bunch for Time-Between-Time.\n\nThe seventh floor? He must be nuts. The Ochterlonie Building was six\nfloors high.\n\nPuzzled, he rang for Howie.\n\n\"What'd they do, build a penthouse office on top of this old dump?\" he\ninquired.\n\nThe elevator operator laughed as at a feeble jest. \"Sure,\" he said\nairily. \"General Motors is using it as a hideaway.\"\n\n\"No, Howie--no fooling. Look here.\"\n\nMallory stared and shook his head. \"There ain't no 746. Somebody got\nthe number wrong. Or they got the building wrong. There's nobody here\nby that name.\"\n\n\"They couldn't--printed envelopes like these.\"\n\n\"O. K., wise guy,\" said Howie. \"Look for yourself.\"\n\nHe led the way to the short flight of iron stairs and the trap door.\nWhile Mallory stood jeering at him, Sam determinedly climbed through.\nThere was nothing in sight but the plain flat roof. He climbed down\nagain.\n\n\"Last letters on my last delivery and I can't deliver them,\" Sam Wilson\nsaid disgustedly.\n\n\"Somebody's playing a joke, maybe.\"\n\n\"Crazy joke. Well, so long, Howie. Some young squirt will be taking his\nlife in his hands in this broken-down cage of yours tomorrow.\"\n\nSam Wilson, whom nothing could deter from the swift completion of\nhis appointed rounds, had to trudge back to the post office with 22\nundelivered letters.\n\nYears ago the United States Post Office gave up searching directories\nand reference books, or deciphering illiterate or screwy addresses,\nso as to make every possible delivery. That went out with three daily\nand two Saturday deliveries, two-cent drop postage, and all the other\namenities that a submissive public let itself lose without a protest.\nBut there was still a city directory in the office. Sam Wilson\nsearched it stubbornly. Time-Between-Time was not listed. Neither was\nOrville K. Hesterson.\n\nThere was nothing to do but consider the letters nixies and turn them\nover to the proper department. If there was another bunch of them\ntomorrow, he would never know.\n\n\n\nRetirement, after the first carefree week, was just as bad as Sam\nWilson had suspected it was going to be. Not bad enough to think yet\nabout elevator operating or night watching, but bad enough to make\nhim restless and edgy, and to make him snap Mollie's head off until\nthey had their first bad quarrel for years. He'd never had time enough\nbefore to keep up with all the science fiction magazines and books.\nNow, with nothing but time, there weren't enough of them to fill the\nlong days. What he needed was something--something that didn't involve\nwalking--to make those endless hours speed up. He began thinking again\nabout those 22 nixies.\n\nHe sat gloomily on a bench in Tompkins Square in the spring sunshine:\njust what he had sworn not to do, but if he stayed home another hour,\nMollie would heave the vacuum cleaner at him. In the public library he\nhad searched directories and phone books, for all the boroughs and for\nsuburban New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania; Orville K. Hesterson\nappeared in none of them.\n\nHe didn't know why it was any of his business, except that\nTime-Between-Time had put a blot on the very end of his 35-year record\nand he wanted revenge. Also, it was something to do and be interested\nin. In a way, science fiction and detection had a lot in common, and\nSam Wilson prided himself on his ability to guess ahead what was going\nto happen in a story. So why couldn't he figure out this puzzle, right\nhere in Manhattan, Terra? But he was stymied.\n\nOr was he?\n\nSam took his gloomy thoughts to Mulligan's. Every large city is\na collection of villages. The people who live long enough in a\nneighborhood acquire their own groceries, their own drugstores,\ntheir own bars. The Wilsons had lived six years in their flat, and\nMulligan's, catercornered across the street, was Sam's personal bar.\n\nHe was cautious as to what he said there. He'd heard enough backtalk\nalready when he had been indiscreet enough once, after four beers, to\nexpress his views on UFOs. He had no desire to gain a reputation as a\ncrackpot. But it was safe enough to remark conversationally, \"How do\nyou find out where a guy is when he says he's someplace and you write\nhim there and the letter comes back?\"\n\n\"You ought to know, Sam,\" said Ed, the day barkeep. \"You were a postman\nlong enough.\"\n\n\"If I knew, I wouldn't ask.\"\n\n\"Ask Information on the phone.\"\n\n\"He hasn't got a phone.\" That was the weirdest part of it--a business\noffice without a phone.\n\nIn every bar, at every moment, there is somebody who knows all the\nanswers. This somebody, a nondescript fellow nursing a Collins down the\nbar, spoke up: \"It could be unlisted.\"\n\nSam's acquaintance didn't include people with unlisted phones; he\nhadn't thought of that.\n\n\"Then how do you find out his number?\"\n\n\"You don't, unless he tells you. That's why he has it unlisted.\"\n\nThe police could get it, Sam thought. But they wouldn't, without a\nreason.\n\n\"Hey, maybe this guy's office is in one of them flying saucers and he\nforgot to come down and get his mail,\" Ed suggested brightly.\n\nSam scowled and walked out.\n\nNevertheless....\n\nNothing to do with UFOs, of course. That was ridiculous.\n\n\n\nBut suppose there was a warp in the space-time continuum? Suppose there\nhad once been another Ochterlonie Building, or some day in the future\nthere was going to be another one, somewhere in New York? There wasn't\nanother now, in any of the boroughs, or any other building with a name\nremotely like it; his research had already established that.\n\nSam went back to the Public Library. The building he knew had been\nerected in 1898. He consulted directories as far back as they went;\nthere never had been one of the name before. Then a time-slip from the\nfuture?\n\nThat was hopeless, so far as he could do anything about it, so he cast\nabout for another solution. How about a parallel world?\n\nThat could be, certainly: some accident by which mail for that other\nOchterlonie Building, the seven-story one, had (maybe just once)\narrived in the wrong dimension.\n\nHe couldn't do anything to prove or disprove that, either. What he\nneeded was a break.\n\nHe got it.\n\nOne morning in early summer his own mailbox in the downstairs hallway\ndisgorged a long envelope, addressed to Mr. Samuel Wilson. The upper\nleft-hand corner bore a printed return address: Time-Between-Time, 746\nOchterlonie Building, New York 3, N. Y. He raced upstairs, locked\nhimself in the bathroom, the one place Mollie couldn't interrupt him,\nand tore the envelope open with trembling fingers.\n\nIt was a form letter, with the \"Dear Mr. Wilson\" not too accurately\ntyped in. It enclosed one of those blue-printed envelopes in simulated\nhandwriting. The letterhead carried the familiar impossible address,\nbut no phone number.\n\nMaybe it was chance, maybe it was ESP, but he himself had got onto\nTime-Between-Time's mailing list!\n\n\n\nHe had trouble focusing his eyes to read the letter.\n\n    Dear Mr. Wilson:\n\n    Would you invest $1 to get a chance at $1,000?\n\n    Of course you would, especially if, win or lose, you got your\n    dollar  back.\n\n    In this atomic age, yesterday's science fiction has become today's\n    and tomorrow's science fact. Time-Between-Time, a new organization,\n    is planning establishment of a publishing company to bring out the\n    best in new books, both fact and fiction, in the field of science,\n    appealing to people who have never been interested until now.\n\n    Before we start, we are conducting a poll to find out what the\n    general public thinks and feels about our probabilities of success.\n    We're asking for your co-operation.\n\n    Our statisticians have told us that from the answers to one\n    question--which may look off the beam but isn't--we can make a\n    pretty good estimate. Here it is:\n\n    If tomorrow morning a spaceship landed in front of your house, and\n    from it issued a band of extraterrestrial beings, who might or\n    might not be human in appearance, what, in your best judgment,\n    would be your own immediate reaction? Check one, or if you agree\n    with none of the choices, indicate in the blank space beneath what\n    your personal reaction would probably be.\n\n    1. Phone for the police. 2. Attack the aliens physically. 3. Faint.\n    4. Run away. 5. Call for assistance to seize the visitors. 6. Greet\n    them, attempt to communicate, and welcome them in the name of your\n    fellow-terrestrials. 7. Other (please specify).\n\n    Return this letter, properly marked, in the enclosed envelope. To\n    defray promotion expenses, enclose a dollar bill (no checks or\n    money orders).\n\n    At the conclusion of this poll, all answers will be evaluated. The\n    writer of the one which comes nearest to the answer reached by our\n    electronic computer, which will be fed the same question, will\n    receive $1,000 in dollar bills. Ties will receive duplicate prizes.\n\n    In addition, all participants, when our publishing firm has been\n    established, will receive for their $1 a credit form entitling\n    them to $1 off any book we publish.\n\n    Don't delay. Send in your answer NOW. Only letters enclosing $1\n    will be entered.\n\n    Very truly yours,\n    Time-Between-Time,\n    Orville K. Hesterson,\n    Sec.-Treas.\n\n\n\nSam Wilson read the letter three times. \"It's crazy,\" he muttered.\n\"It's a gyp.\"\n\nWhat he ought to do was take the letter to the post office--Mr. Gross\nwould be the one to see--and let them decide whether this Hesterson was\nusing the mails to defraud. Let Mr. Gross and his department try to\nfind 746 in the six-story Ochterlonie Building. As a faithful employee\nfor 35 years, it was Sam's plain duty.\n\nBut then it would be out of his hands forever; he'd never even find out\nwhat happened. And he'd be back in the dull morass that retirement was\nturning out to be.\n\n\"Sam!\" Mollie yelled outside the locked door. \"Aren't you ever coming\nout of there?\"\n\n\"I'm coming, I'm coming!\" He put the letter and its enclosure back in\nthe envelope and placed them in a pocket.\n\nTime enough to decide that afternoon what he was going to do.\n\nHe escaped after lunch to what was becoming his refuge on a park\nbench. There he read the letter for the fourth time. For a long while\nhe sat ruminating. About three o'clock he walked to the General Post\nOffice--walking had become a habit hard to break--and hunted up the man\nwho now had his old route, a youngster not more than 30 named Flanagan.\n\nFrom the letter Sam extracted the return envelope.\n\n\"You been delivering any like this?\" he asked.\n\nFlanagan peered at it.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said. \"Plenty.\" He looked worried. \"Gee, Wilson, I'm glad\nyou came in. There's something funny about those deliveries, and I\ndon't want to get in Dutch.\"\n\n\"Funny how?\"\n\n\"My very first day on the route, I started up to the seventh floor of\nthat building to deliver them--and there wasn't any seventh floor. So I\nasked the old elevator man--\"\n\n\"Howie Mallory. I know him. He's been there for years.\"\n\n\"I guess so. Anyway, he said it was O. K. just to give them to him.\nHe showed me a paper, signed with the name of this outfit, by the\nsecretary or something--\"\n\n\"Orville K. Hesterson,\" Sam said.\n\n\"That was it--saying that all mail for them was to be delivered to the\nelevator operator until further notice. So I've been giving it to him\never since--there's a big bunch every day. Is something wrong, Sam?\nHave I pulled a boner? Am I going to be in trouble?\"\n\n\"No trouble. I'm just checking--little job they asked me to do for\nthem, seeing I'm retired.\" Sam was surprised at the glibness with which\nthat fib came out.\n\nFlanagan looked still more worried. \"He said their office was being\nremodeled or something, so he was looking after their mail till they\ncould move in.\"\n\n\"Sure. Don't give it another thought.\" Another idea occurred to him; he\nlowered his voice. \"I oughtn't to tell you this, Flanagan, but every\nnew man on a route, they kind of check up on him the first few weeks,\nsee if he's handling everything O.K. I'll tell them you're doing fine.\"\n\n\"Hey, thanks. Thanks a lot.\"\n\n\"Don't say anything about this. It's supposed to be secret.\"\n\n\"Oh, I won't.\"\n\nSam Wilson waved and walked out. He sat on the steps a while to think.\n\nWas old Howie Mallory pulling a fast one? Was _he_ Orville K.\nHesterson? Had he cooked up a scheme to make himself some crooked money?\n\n\n\nThree things against that. First, those nixies the first day: why\nwouldn't Mallory have told him the same thing he told Flanagan? Sam\nwould have believed him, if he had said they were building an office on\nthe roof and giving it a number.\n\nSecond, Howie just wasn't smart enough. Of course he could be fronting\nfor the real crook. But Sam had known him for years, and old Howie had\nalways seemed downright stupidly honest. A man doesn't suddenly turn\ninto a criminal after a lifetime of probity.\n\nThird, if this was some fraudulent scheme involving Mallory, nobody the\nold man knew--least of all the postman who used to deliver mail to that\nvery building--would ever have been allowed to appear on the sucker\nlist.\n\nSam Wilson thought some more. Then he hunted up the nearest pay phone\nand called Mollie.\n\n\"Mollie? Sam. Look, I just met an old friend of mine--\" he picked a\nname from a billboard visible from the phone booth--\"Bill Seagram, you\nremember him--oh, sure you do; you've just forgotten. Anyway, he's\njust here for the day and we're going to have dinner and see a show.\nDon't wait up for me. I might be pretty late.... No, I'm _not_ phoning\nfrom Mulligan's.... Now you know me, Mollie; do I ever drink too\nmuch?... Yeah, sure, he ought to've asked you too, but he didn't. O.K.,\nhe's impolite. Aw, Mollie, don't be like that--\"\n\nShe hung up on him.\n\nSam Wilson stood concealed in a doorway from which he could see the\ncramped lobby of the Ochterlonie Building. It was ten minutes before\nsomebody entered it and rang for the elevator. The minute Howie Mallory\nstarted up with his passenger, Sam darted into the building and started\nclimbing the stairs. He heard Mallory passing him, going down again,\nbut the elevator wasn't visible from the stairway. On the sixth floor,\nafter a quick survey to see that the hall was clear and the doors\nclosed that he had to pass, he found the iron steps to the trapdoor.\n\nThe roof was just as empty as the other time he had visited it. No, it\nwasn't. In a corner by the parapet, weighted with a brick to keep it\nfrom blowing away, was a large paper bag. Sam picked up the brick and\nlooked inside. It was stuffed with those blue-printed return envelopes.\n\nHe looked carefully about him. There were buildings all around,\ntowering over the little old Ochterlonie Building. There were plenty\nof windows from which a curious eye could discern anything happening\non that roof. But at night anybody in those buildings would be either\nworking late or cleaning offices, with no reason whatever to go to a\nwindow; and Sam was sure nothing was going to happen till after dark.\n\nIt was a warm day and he had been carrying his coat. He folded it and\nput it down near the paper bag and sat on it with his back against the\nparapet. He cursed himself for not having had more foresight; he should\nhave brought something to eat and something to read. Well, he wasn't\ngoing to climb down all those stairs and up again. He lighted his pipe\nand began waiting.\n\nHe must have dozed off, for he came to himself with a start and found\nit was almost dark. The paper bag was still there. It was just as well\nhe had slept; now he'd have no trouble staying awake and watching. He\nmight very well be there all night--in fact, he'd have to be, whether\nanything happened or not. The front door would be locked by now. Mollie\nwould have a fit, but he had his alibi ready.\n\nThere was only one explanation left. Not time travel. Not alternate\nuniverses. Not an ordinary confidence game. Not--decidedly not--a hoax.\n\nIf he was wrong, then tomorrow morning he'd take the whole business to\nMr. Gross. But he had a hunch he wasn't going to be wrong.\n\n\n\nIt was 12:15 by his wristwatch when he saw it coming.\n\nIt had no lights; nobody could have spotted it as it appeared suddenly\nout of nowhere and climbed straight down. It landed lightly as a drop\nof dew. The port opened and a small, spare man, very neatly dressed,\nas Sam could see with eyes accustomed to the darkness, stepped out.\nOrville K. Hesterson in person.\n\nHe tiptoed quickly to the paper bag. Then he saw Sam and stopped\nshort. Sam reached out and grabbed a wrist. It felt like flesh, but he\ncouldn't be sure.\n\n\"Who are you? What are you doing here?\" the newcomer said in a strained\nwhisper, just like a scared character in a soap opera. So he spoke\nEnglish. Good: Sam didn't speak anything else.\n\n\"I'm from the United States Post Office,\" Sam replied suavely. Well, he\nhad been, long enough, hadn't he?\n\n\"Oh. Well, now look, my friend--\"\n\n\"_You_ look. Talk. How much are you paying the elevator operator to put\nyour mail up here every day?\"\n\n\"Five dollars a day, in dollar bills, six days a week, left in the\nempty bag,\" answered Hesterson--it must be Hesterson--sullenly. \"That's\nno crime, is it? Call this my office, and call that my rent. All I need\nan office for is to have somewhere to get my letters.\"\n\n\"Letters with money in them.\"\n\n\"We have to have funds for postage, don't we?\"\n\n\"What about the postage on the first mailing list, before you got any\ndollars to pay for stamps?\"\n\nIf it had been a little lighter, Sam would have been surer of the alarm\nthat crossed Hesterson's face.\n\n\"I--well, we had to fabricate some of your currency for that. We\nregretted it--we aim to obey all local rules and regulations. As soon\nas we have enough coming in, we intend to send the amount to the New\nYork postmaster as anonymous conscience money.\"\n\n\"How about the $1,000 prize? And those dollar book credits?\"\n\n\"Oh, that. Well, we say '_when_ our publishing firm has been\nestablished,' don't we? That publishing thing is just a gimmick. As for\nthe $1,000, we give no intimation of when the poll will end.\"\n\nSam tightened his grasp on the wrist, which was beginning to wriggle.\n\n\"I see. O.K., explain the whole setup. It sounds crazy to me.\"\n\n\"I couldn't agree with you more,\" said Mr. Hesterson, to Sam's\nsurprise. \"That's exactly what, in our own idiom, I told--\" Sam\ncouldn't get the name; it sounded like a grunt. \"But he's the boss and\nI'm only a scout third class.\" His voice grew plaintive. \"You can't\nimagine what an ordeal it is, almost every week, to have to land in a\nsecluded place where I can hide the flyer, make my way to New York, and\nbuy a bunch of stamps and mail a batch of letters in broad daylight. We\ncan simulate your paper and printing and typing well enough, but\"--that\ngrunt again--\"insists we use genuine stamps. I told you we try to\nfollow all your laws, as far as we possibly can. It's very difficult\nfor me to keep this absurd shape for long at a time; I'm exhausted\nafter every trip. I can assure you, these little night excursions\nfrom the mother-ship to pick up the letters are the very least of my\nburdens!\"\n\n\"What in time does your boss think he's going to gain by such a screwy\ncome-on?\"\n\n\"'In time'? Oh, just an idiomatic phrase. Like our calling our\norganization Time-Between-Time, time of course being just a dimension\nof space. I learned your tongue mostly from the B.B.C. and I don't\nalways understand your speech in New York. My dear sir, do you here\non this planet ask your bosses why they concoct their plans? Mine has\na very profound mind; that's why he is the boss. All I know is that he\npersuaded the Council to try it out. A softening-up process--isn't that\nwhat you people call it when you use it in your silly wars with one\nanother?\"\n\n\"Softening for what?\" But Sam Wilson knew the answer already.\n\n\n\n\"Why, for the invasion, of course,\" said Orville K. Hesterson, whose\nown name was probably a grunt. \"Surely you must be aware that, with\nplanetwide devastation likely and even imminent, every world whose\ninhabitants can live comfortably under extreme radiation is looking to\nyours--Earth, as you call it--as a possible area for colonization? So\nmany planets are so terribly overcrowded--there's always a rush for a\nnew frontier. We've missed out too often; this time we're determined to\nbe first.\"\n\n\"I'll be darned,\" said Sam, \"if I can see how that questionnaire would\nbe any help to you.\"\n\n\"But it's elementary, as I believe one of your famous law-enforcers\nonce declared. First of all, we're gaining a pretty good idea of what\nkind of reception we're likely to meet when we arrive, and therefore\nwhether we're going to need weapons to destroy what will be left of the\npopulation, or can reasonably expect to take over without difficulty.\nWe figure that a cross-section of one of your largest cities will be\na pretty good indication, and we can extrapolate from that. In the\nsecond place, the question itself is deliberately worded to startle the\nrecipients, who have never in their lives contemplated such a thing as\nan extraterrestrial visitor--\"\n\n\"Not me. I'm a science fiction fan from way back. It's all old stuff to\nme.\"\n\nHesterson clicked his tongue--or at least the tongue he was wearing.\n\"Oh, dear, that _was_ an error. We tried particularly not to include\non our lists subscribers to any of your speculative periodicals. That\nwasn't my mistake, thank goodness; it was another scout who had the\nhorrible job of spending several days here and compiling the lists.\nUnder your present low radioactivity it's real agony for us.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you one mistake you did make, though,\" said Sam angrily.\n\"You ought to've arranged with the elevator man before your first lot\nof answers was due. If you want to know, that's how I got onto the\nwhole thing. I'm a mail carrier--I'm retired now, but I was then--and\nI was the one supposed to deliver the first batch. Mallory--that's the\nelevator operator--laughed in my face and told me there wasn't any\n746 in this building, and I had to take the letters back to the post\noffice--on my _last_ delivery!\" Sam couldn't keep the bitterness out of\nhis voice. \"After 35 years--well, that's neither here nor there. But I\ndidn't like that and I made up my mind to find out what was happening.\"\n\n\"So that's it. Oh, dear, dear. I'll have to compensate for that or I\n_will_ be in trouble.\"\n\nSam had had enough. \"You are in trouble right now,\" he growled, pushing\nthe little alien back against the parapet. \"We're staying right here\ntill morning, and then I'm going to call for help and take you and your\nflying saucer or whatever it is straight to the F.B.I.\"\n\nThe counterfeit Mr. Hesterson laughed.\n\n\"Oh, no indeed you aren't,\" he said mildly. \"I can slip right back into\nmy own shape whenever I want to--the only reason I haven't done it\nyet is that then I wouldn't have the equipment to talk to you--and I\nassure you that you couldn't hold me then. On the contrary. As you just\npointed out to me, I did make one bad error, and my boss doesn't like\nerrors. I have no intention of making another one by leaving you here\nto spread the news.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Sam Wilson cried. For the first time, after the\nyears of accustomedness to the idea of extraterrestrial beings, a\nthrill of pure terror shot through him.\n\n\"This,\" said the outsider softly.\n\n\n\nBefore Sam could take another breath, the wrist he was holding slid\nfrom his grasp, all of Mr. Hesterson slithered into something utterly\nbeyond imagining, and Sam found himself enveloped in invisible chains\nagainst which he was unable to make the slightest struggle. He felt\nhimself being lifted and thrown into the cockpit. Something landed on\ntop of him--undoubtedly the package of prize entries and dollar bills.\nHis last conscious thought was a despairing one of Mollie.\n\nSam Wilson, devoted mail carrier, was making a longer trip than any\nPersian courier ever dreamed of, and not snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor\ngloom of night could stay him from his appointed round.\n\nBut he may not be gone forever. If he can be kept alive on that planet\nin some other solar system, they plan to bring him back as Exhibit One\nwhenever World War III has made Earth sufficiently radioactive for\nOrville K. Hesterson's co-planetarians to live here comfortably.",
