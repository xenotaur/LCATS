    "body": "Len and Moira Connington lived in a rented cottage with a small yard,\na smaller garden, and too many fir trees. The lawn, which Len seldom\nhad time to mow, was full of weeds, and the garden was overgrown with\nblackberry brambles. The house itself was clean and smelled better\nthan most city apartments, and Moira kept geraniums in the windows.\n\nHowever, it was dark on account of the firs. Approaching the door one\nlate spring afternoon, Len tripped on an unnoticed flagstone and\nscattered examination papers all the way to the porch.\n\nWhen he picked himself up, Moira was giggling in the doorway. \"That\nwas funny.\"\n\n\"The hell it was,\" said Len. \"I banged my nose.\" He picked up his\nChemistry B papers in a stiff silence. A red drop fell on the last\none. \"_Damn_ it!\"\n\nMoira held the screen door for him, looking contrite and faintly\nsurprised. She followed him into the bathroom. \"Len, I didn't mean to\nlaugh. Does it hurt much?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Len, staring fiercely at his scraped nose in the mirror. It\nwas throbbing like a gong.\n\n\"That's good. It was the funniest thing--I mean funny-peculiar,\" she\nclarified hastily.\n\n\n\nLen stared at her; the whites of her eyes were showing: \"Is there\nanything the matter with you?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said on a rising note. \"Nothing like that ever\nhappened to me before. I didn't think it was funny at all. I was\nworried about you, and I didn't know I was going to laugh--\" She\nlaughed again, a trifle nervously. \"Maybe I'm cracking up.\"\n\nMoira was a dark-haired young woman with a placid, friendly\ndisposition. Len had met her in his senior year at Columbia,\nwith--looking at it impartially, which Len seldom did--regrettable\nresults. At present, in her seventh month, she was shaped like a\nrather bosomy kewpie doll.\n\n_Emotional upsets_, he remembered, _may occur frequently during this\nperiod_. He leaned to get past her belly and kissed her forgivingly.\n\"You're probably tired. Go sit down and I'll get you some coffee.\"\n\nExcept that Moira had never had any hysterics till now, or morning\nsickness, either--she burped instead--and anyhow, was there anything\nin the literature about fits of giggling?\n\nAfter supper, he marked seventeen sets of papers desultorily in red\npencil, then got up to look for the baby book. There were four\ndog-eared paperbound volumes with smiling infants' faces on the\ncovers, but the one he wanted wasn't there. He looked behind the\nbookcase and on the wicker table beside it. \"Moira!\"\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\n\"Where the devil is the other baby book?\"\n\n\"I've got it.\"\n\nLen went and looked over her shoulder. She was staring at a drawing of\na fetus lying in a sort of upside-down Yoga position inside a\ncross-sectioned woman's body.\n\n\"That's what he looks like,\" she said. \"_Mama._\"\n\nThe diagram was of a fetus at term.\n\n\"What was that about your mother?\" Len asked, puzzled.\n\n\"Don't be silly,\" she said abstractedly.\n\nHe waited, but she didn't look up or turn the page. After a while, he\nwent back to his work. He watched her.\n\nEventually she leafed through to the back of the book, read a few\npages, and put it down. She lighted a cigarette and immediately put it\nout again. She fetched up a belch.\n\n\"That was a good one,\" said Len admiringly.\n\nMoira sighed.\n\nFeeling tense, Len picked up his coffee cup and started toward the\nkitchen. He halted beside Moira's chair. On the side table was her\nafter-dinner cup, still full of coffee ... black, scummed with oil\ndroplets, stone-cold.\n\n\"Didn't you want your coffee?\" he asked solicitously.\n\nShe looked at the cup. \"I did, but--\" She paused and shook her head,\nlooking perplexed.\n\n\"Well, do you want another cup now?\"\n\n\"Yes, please. _No._\"\n\nLen, who had begun a step, rocked back on his heels. \"Which, damn it?\"\n\nHer face got all swollen. \"Oh, Len, I'm so mixed up,\" she said, and\nbegan to tremble.\n\nLen felt part of his irritation spilling over into protectiveness.\n\"What you need,\" he said firmly, \"is a drink.\"\n\n\n\nHe climbed a stepladder to get at the top cabinet shelf which cached\ntheir liquor when they had any. Small upstate towns and their school\nboards being what they were, this was one of many necessary financial\nprecautions.\n\nInspecting the doleful few fingers of whisky in the bottle, Len swore\nunder his breath. They couldn't afford a decent supply of booze or new\nclothes for Moira. The original idea had been for Len to teach for a\nyear while they saved enough money so that he could go back for his\nmaster's degree. More lately, this proving unlikely, they had merely\nbeen trying to put aside enough for summer school, and even that was\nbeginning to look like the wildest optimism.\n\nHigh-school teachers without seniority weren't supposed to be married.\n\nOr graduate physics students, for that matter.\n\nHe mixed two stiff highballs and carried them back into the living\nroom. \"Here you are. Skoal.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" she said appreciatively. \"That tastes--_Ugh_.\" She set the glass\ndown and stared at it with her mouth half open.\n\n\"What's the matter now?\"\n\nShe turned her head carefully, as if she were afraid it would come\noff. \"Len, I don't know. _Mama._\"\n\n\"That's the second time you've said that. What is this all--\"\n\n\"Said what?\"\n\n\"Mama. Look, kid, if you're--\"\n\n\"I didn't.\" She appeared a little feverish.\n\n\"Sure you did,\" said Len reasonably. \"Once when you were looking at\nthe baby book, and then again just now, after you said ugh to the\nhighball. Speaking of which--\"\n\n\"_Mama drink milk_,\" said Moira, speaking with exaggerated clarity.\n\nMoira hated milk.\n\nLen swallowed half his highball, turned and went silently into the\nkitchen.\n\nWhen he came back with the milk, Moira looked at it as if it contained\na snake. \"Len, I didn't say that.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"I didn't. I didn't say mama and I didn't say that about the milk.\"\nHer voice quavered. \"And I didn't laugh at you when you fell down.\"\n\nLen tried to be patient. \"It was somebody else.\"\n\n\"It _was_.\" She looked down at her gingham-covered bulge. \"You won't\nbelieve me. Put your hand there. No, a little lower.\"\n\nUnder the cloth, her flesh was warm and solid against his palm.\n\"Kicks?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Not yet. Now,\" she said in a strained voice, \"you in there--if you\nwant your milk, kick three times.\"\n\nLen opened his mouth and shut it again. Under his hand there were\nthree explicit kicks, one after the other.\n\nMoira closed her eyes, held her breath and drank the milk down in one\nlong horrid gulp.\n\n\n\n\"Once in a great while,\" Moira read, \"cell cleavage will not have\nfollowed the orderly pattern that produces a normal baby. In these\nrare cases some parts of the body will develop excessively, while\nothers do not develop at all. This disorderly cell growth, which is\nstrikingly similar to the wild cell growth that we know as cancer--\"\nHer shoulders moved convulsively in a shudder. \"_Bluh!_\"\n\n\"Why do you keep reading that stuff, if it makes you feel that way?\"\n\n\"I have to,\" she said absently. She picked up another book from the\nstack. \"There's a page missing.\"\n\nLen attacked the last of his medium-boiled egg in a noncommittal\nmanner. \"It's a wonder it's held together this long,\" he said, which\nwas perfectly just.\n\nThe book had had something spilled on it, partially dissolving the\nglue, and was in an advanced state of anarchy. However, the fact was\nthat Len had torn out the page in question four nights ago, after\nreading it carefully. The topic was \"Psychoses in Pregnancy.\"\n\nMoira had now decided that the baby was male, that his name was\nLeonardo (not referring to Len, but to da Vinci), that he had informed\nher of these things along with a good many others, that he was keeping\nher from her favorite foods and making her eat things she detested,\nlike liver and tripe, and that she had to read books of his choice all\nday long in order to keep him from kicking.\n\nIt was miserably hot. With Commencement only two weeks away, Len's\nstudents were torpid and galvanic by turns. Then there was the matter\nof his contract for next year, and the possible opening at Oster High\nwhich would mean more money, and the Parent-Teachers thing tonight at\nwhich Superintendent Greer and his wife would be regally present.\n\nMoira was knee-deep in Volume I of _Der Untergang des Abendlandes_,\nmoving her lips; an occasional guttural escaped her.\n\nLen cleared his throat. \"Moy?\"\n\n\"--_und also des tragischen_--what in God's name does he mean by\nthat--? What, Len?\"\n\nHe made an irritated noise. \"Why not try the English edition?\"\n\n\"Leo wants to learn German. What were you going to say?\"\n\nLen closed his eyes for a moment. \"About this PTA business--you sure\nyou want to go?\"\n\n\"Well, of course. It's pretty important, isn't it? Unless you think I\nlook too sloppy--\"\n\n\"No. No, damn it! But are you feeling up to it?\"\n\nThere were faint violet crescents under Moira's eyes; she had been\nsleeping badly. \"Sure,\" she said.\n\n\"All right. And you'll go see the doctor tomorrow?\"\n\n\"I said I would.\"\n\n\"And you won't say anything about Leo to Mrs. Greer or anybody?\"\n\n\n\nShe looked slightly embarrassed. \"Not till he's born, I think, don't\nyou? It would be an awful hard thing to prove--even you wouldn't have\nbelieved me if you hadn't felt him kick.\"\n\nThis experiment had not been repeated, though Len had asked often\nenough. All little Leo had wanted, Moira said, was to establish\ncommunication with his mother--he didn't seem to be interested in Len\nat all. \"Too young,\" she explained.\n\nAnd still--Len recalled the frogs his biology class had dissected last\nsemester. One of them had had two hearts. _This disorderly cell growth ...\nlike a cancer._ Unpredictable: extra fingers or toes or a double dose of\ncortex?\n\n\"And I'll burp like a lady, if at all,\" Moira assured him cheerfully\nas they got ready to leave.\n\n\n\nThe room was empty, except for the ladies of the Committee, two\nnervously smiling male teachers and the impressive bulk of\nSuperintendent Greer when the Conningtons arrived. Card-table legs\nskreeked on the bare floor; the air was heavy with wood polish and\nmusk.\n\nGreer advanced, beaming fixedly. \"Well, isn't this nice? How are you\nyoung folks this warm evening?\"\n\n\"Oh, we thought we'd be earlier, Mr. Greer,\" said Moira with pretty\nvexation. She looked surprisingly schoolgirlish and chic; the lump\nthat was Leo was hardly noticeable unless you caught her in profile.\n\"I'll go right now and help the ladies. There must be something I can\nstill do.\"\n\n\"No, now, we won't hear of it. But I'll tell you what you can do--you\ncan go right over there and say hello to Mrs. Greer. I know she's\ndying to sit down and have a good chat with you. Go ahead now, don't\nworry about this husband of yours; I'll take care of him.\"\n\nMoira receded into a scattering of small shrieks of pleasure, at least\nhalf of them arcing across a gap of mutual dislike.\n\nGreer, exhibiting perfect dentures, exhaled Listerine. His pink skin\nlooked not only scrubbed but disinfected; his gold-rimmed glasses\nbelonged in an optometrist's window, and his tropical suit had\nobviously come straight from the cleaner's. It was impossible to think\nof Greer unshaven, Greer smoking a cigar, Greer with a smudge of axle\ngrease on his forehead, or Greer making love to his wife.\n\n\"Well, sir, this weather--\"\n\n\"When I think of what this valley was like twenty years ago--\"\n\n\"At today's prices--\"\n\nLen listened with growing admiration, putting in comments where\nrequired. He had never realized before that there were so many\nabsolutely neutral topics of conversation.\n\nA few more people straggled in, raising the room temperature about\nhalf a degree per capita. Greer did not perspire; he merely glowed.\n\n\n\nAcross the room, Moira was now seated chummily with Mrs. Greer, a\nlarge-bosomed woman in an outrageously unfashionable hat. Moira\nappeared to be telling a joke; Len knew perfectly well that it was a\nclean one, but he listened tensely, all the same, until he heard Mrs.\nGreer yelp with laughter. Her voice carried well: \"Oh, that's\n_priceless_! Oh, dear, I _only_ hope I can remember it!\"\n\nLen had resolutely not been thinking of ways to turn the conversation\ntoward the Oster vacancy. He stiffened again when he realized that\nGreer had abruptly begun to talk shop. His heart began pounding\nabsurdly; Greer was asking highly pertinent questions in a\ngood-humored but businesslike way--drawing Len out, and not even\nbothering to be the slightest bit Machiavellian about it.\n\nLen answered candidly, except when he was certain that he knew what\nthe Superintendent wanted to hear; then he lied like a Trojan.\n\nMrs. Greer had conjured up a premature pot of tea and, oblivious of\nthe stares of the thirsty teachers present, she and Moira were hogging\nit, heads together, as if they were plotting the overthrow of the\nRepublic or exchanging recipes.\n\nGreer listened attentively to Len's final reply, which was delivered\nwith as pious an air as if Len had been a Boy Scout swearing on the\nManual. But since the question had been \"Do you plan to make teaching\nyour career?\" there was not a word of truth in it.\n\nHe then inspected his paunch and assumed a mild theatrical frown. Len,\nwith that social sixth sense which is unmistakable when it operates,\nknew that his next words were going to be: \"You may have heard that\nOster High will be needing a new science teacher next fall....\"\n\nAt this point Moira made a noise like a seal.\n\nThe ensuing silence was broken a moment later by a hearty scream,\nfollowed instantly by a clatter and a bone-shaking thud.\n\nMrs. Greer was sitting on the floor, legs sprawled, hat over her eye.\nShe appeared to be attempting to perform some sort of excessively\npagan dance.\n\n\n\n\"It was Leo,\" Moira incoherently told Len at home. \"You know she's\nEnglish--she said of course a cup of tea wouldn't hurt me, and she\ninsisted I go ahead and drink it while it was hot, and I couldn't--\"\n\n\"No, no--wait,\" said Len in a controlled fury. \"What--\"\n\n\"So I _drank_ some. And Leo kicked up and made me burp the burp I was\nsaving. And--\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord!\"\n\n\"--then he kicked the teacup out of my hand into her lap, and I wish I\nwas _dead_!\"\n\nOn the following day, Len took Moira to the doctor's office, where\nthey read dog-eared copies of _The Rotarian_ and _Field and Stream_\nfor an hour.\n\nDr. Berry was a round little man with soulful eyes and a\ntwenty-four-hour bedside manner. On the walls of his office, where it\nis customary for doctors to hang all sorts of diplomas and\ncertificates of membership, Berry had only three. The rest of the\nspace was filled with enlarged colored photographs of beautiful,\nbeautiful children.\n\nWhen Len followed Moira determinedly into the consulting room, Berry\nlooked mildly shocked for a moment, then apparently decided to carry\non as if nothing outre had happened. You could not say that he spoke,\nor even whispered; he rustled.\n\n\"Now, Mrs. Connington, we're looking just fine today. How have we been\nfeeling?\"\n\n\"Just fine. My husband thinks I'm insane.\"\n\n\"That's g--Well, that's a funny thing for him to think, isn't it?\"\nBerry glanced at the wall midway between himself and Len, then\nshuffled some file cards rather nervously. \"Now. Have we had any\nsoreness in our stomach?\"\n\n\"Yes. He's been kicking me black and blue.\"\n\nBerry misinterpreted Moira's brooding glance at Len, and his eyebrows\ntwitched involuntarily.\n\n\"The baby,\" said Len. \"The _baby_ kicks her.\"\n\nBerry coughed. \"Any headaches? Dizziness? Vomiting? Swelling in our\nlegs or ankles?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"All rightie. Now let's just find out how much we've gained, and then\nwe'll get up on the examination table.\"\n\nBerry drew the sheet down over Moira's abdomen as if it were an\nexceptionally fragile egg. He probed delicately with his fat\nfingertips, then used the stethoscope.\n\n\"Those X-rays,\" said Len. \"Have they come back yet?\"\n\n\"Mm-hm,\" said Berry. \"Yes, they have.\" He moved the stethoscope and\nlistened again.\n\n\"Did they show anything unusual?\" Len asked.\n\nBerry's eyebrows twitched a polite question.\n\n\"We've been having a little argument,\" Moira said in a strained voice,\n\"about whether this is an ordinary baby or not.\"\n\nBerry took the stethoscope tubes away from his ears. He gazed at Moira\nlike an anxious spaniel.\n\n\"Now let's not worry about _that_. We're going to have a perfectly\nhealthy wonderful baby, and if anybody tells us differently, why,\nwe'll just tell them to go jump in the lake, won't we?\"\n\n\"The baby is absolutely normal?\" Len said in a marked manner.\n\n\"Absolutely.\" Berry applied the stethoscope again. His face blanched.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Len asked after a moment.\n\nThe doctor's gaze was fixed and glassy.\n\n\"Vagitus uterinus,\" Berry muttered. He pulled the stethoscope off\nabruptly and stared at it. \"No, of course it couldn't be. Now isn't\nthat a nuisance? We seem to be picking up a radio broadcast with our\nlittle stethoscope here. I'll just go and get another instrument.\"\n\nMoira and Len exchanged glances. Moira's was almost excessively bland.\n\nBerry confidently came in with a new stethoscope, put the diaphragm\nagainst Moira's belly, listened for an instant and twitched once all\nover, as if his mainspring had snapped. Visibly jangling, he stepped\naway from the table. His jaw worked several times before any sound\ncame out.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" he said, and walked out in an uneven line.\n\nLen snatched up the instrument he had dropped.\n\nLike a bell ringing under water, muffled but clear, a tiny voice was\nshouting: \"_You bladder-headed pillpusher! You bedside vacuum! You\nfifth-rate tree surgeon! You inflated--_\" A pause. \"_Is that you,\nConnington? Get off the line; I haven't finished with Dr. Bedpan\nyet._\"\n\nMoira smiled, like a Buddha-shaped bomb.\n\n\"Well?\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"We've got to think,\" Len kept saying over and over.\n\n\"_You've_ got to think.\" Moira was combing her hair, snapping the comb\nsmartly at the end of each stroke. \"I've had plenty of time to think,\never since it happened. When you catch up--\"\n\nLen flung his tie at the carved wooden pineapple on the corner of the\nfootboard. \"Moy, be _reasonable_. The chances against the kid kicking\nthree times in any one-minute period are only about one in a hundred.\nThe chances against anything like--\"\n\nMoira grunted and stiffened for a moment. Then she cocked her head to\none side with a listening expression ... a new mannerism of hers that\nwas beginning to send intangible snakes crawling up Len's spine.\n\n\"What now?\" he asked sharply.\n\n\"He says to keep our voices down. He's thinking.\"\n\nLen's fingers clenched convulsively, and a button flew off his shirt.\nShaking, he pulled his arms out of the sleeves and dropped the shirt\non the floor. \"Look. I just want to get this straight. When he talks\nto you, you don't hear him shouting all the way up past your liver and\nlights. What--\"\n\n\"You know perfectly well he reads my mind.\"\n\n\"That isn't the same as--\" Len took a deep breath. \"Let's not get off\non that. What I want to know is, what is it like? Do you seem to hear\na real voice, or do you just know what he's telling you, without\nknowing how you know?\"\n\nMoira put the comb down in order to think better. \"It isn't like\nhearing a voice. You'd never confuse one with the other. It's\nmore--the nearest I can come to it, it's like remembering a voice.\nExcept that you don't know what's coming.\"\n\nLen picked his tie off the floor and abstractedly began knotting it on\nhis bare chest. \"And he sees what you see, he knows what you're\nthinking, he can hear when people talk to you?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"This is tremendous!\" Len began to blunder around the bed-room, not\nlooking where he was going. \"They thought Macaulay was a genius. This\nkid isn't even born. I _heard_ him. He was cussing Berry out like\nMonty Woolley.\"\n\n\"He had me reading _The Man Who Came to Dinner_ two days ago.\"\n\nLen made his way around a small bedside table by trial and error.\n\"That's another thing. How much could you say about his--his\npersonality? I mean does he seem to know what he's doing, or is he\njust striking out wildly in all directions?\" He paused. \"Are you sure\nhe's really conscious at all?\"\n\n\n\nMoira began, \"That's a silly--\" and stopped. \"Define consciousness,\"\nshe said doubtfully.\n\n\"All right, what I really mean--_why_ am I wearing this necktie?\" He\nripped it off and threw it over a lampshade. \"What I mean--\"\n\n\"Are you sure you're really conscious?\"\n\n\"Okay. You make joke, I laugh, ha-ha. What I'm trying to ask is, have\nyou seen any evidence of creative thought, organized thought, or is he\njust--integrating, along the lines of--of instinctive responses? Do\nyou--\"\n\n\"I know what you mean. Shut up a minute.... I don't know.\"\n\n\"I mean is he awake, or asleep and dreaming about us, like the Red\nKing?\"\n\n\"I don't _know_!\"\n\n\"And if that's it, what'll happen when he wakes up?\"\n\nMoira took off her robe, folded it neatly, and maneuvered herself\nbetween the sheets. \"Come to bed.\"\n\nLen got one sock off before another thought struck him. \"He reads your\nmind. Can he read other people's?\" He looked appalled. \"Can he read\nmine?\"\n\n\"He doesn't. Whether it's because he can't, I don't know. I think he\njust doesn't care.\"\n\nLen pulled the other sock halfway down and left it there. In a stiffer\ntone, he said, \"One of the things he doesn't care about is whether I\nhave a job.\"\n\n\"No. He thought it was funny. I wanted to sink through the floor, but\nI had all I could do to keep from laughing when she fell down.... Len,\nwhat are we going to do?\"\n\nHe swiveled around and looked at her.\n\n\"Look,\" he said, \"I didn't mean to sound that gloomy. We'll do\nsomething. We'll fix it. Really.\"\n\n\"I hope so.\"\n\nCareful of his elbows and knees, Len climbed into the bed beside her.\n\"Okay now?\"\n\n\"Mm.... Ugh.\" Moira tried to sit up suddenly, and almost made it. She\nwound up propped on one elbow, and said indignantly, \"Oh, no!\"\n\nLen stared at her in the dimness. \"What--?\"\n\nShe grunted again. \"Len, get up. All _right_. Len, _hurry_!\"\n\nLen fought his way convulsively past a treacherous sheet and staggered\nup, goose-pimpled and tense. \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"You'll have to sleep on the couch. The sheets are in the bottom--\"\n\n\"On that couch? Are you crazy?\"\n\n\"I can't help it,\" she said in a small faint voice. \"Please don't\nlet's argue. You'll just have to.\"\n\n\"_Why?_\"\n\n\"We can't sleep in the same bed,\" she wailed. \"He says\nit's--oh!--unhygienic!\"\n\n\n\nLen's contract was not renewed. He got a job waiting on tables in a\nresort hotel, an occupation which pays more money than teaching future\ncitizens the rudiments of three basic sciences, but for which Len had\nno aptitude. He lasted three days at it; he was then idle for a week\nand a half until his four years of college physics earned him\nemployment as a clerk in an electrical shop. His employer was a\ncheerfully aggressive man who assured Len that there were great\nopportunities in radio and television, and firmly believed that\natom-bomb tests were causing all the bad weather.\n\nMoira, in her eighth month, walked to the county library every day and\ntrundled a load of books home in the perambulator. Little Leo, it\nappeared, was working his way simultaneously through biology,\nastrophysics, phrenology, chemical engineering, architecture,\nChristian Science, psychosomatic medicine, marine law; business\nmanagement, Yoga, crystallography, metaphysics and modern literature.\n\nHis domination of Moira's life remained absolute, and his experiments\nwith her regimen continued. One week, she ate nothing but nuts and\nfruit, washed down with distilled water; the next, she was on a diet\nof porterhouse steak, dandelion greens and Hadacol.\n\nWith the coming of full summer, fortunately, few of the high school\nstaff were in evidence. Len met Dr. Berry once on the street. Berry\nstarted, twitched, and walked off rapidly in an entirely new\ndirection.\n\nThe diabolical event was due on or about July 29th. Len crossed off\neach day on their wall calendar with an emphatic black grease pencil.\nIt would, he supposed, be an uncomfortable thing at best to be the\nparent of a super-prodigy. Leo would no doubt be dictator of the world\nby the time he was fifteen, unless he would be assassinated first, but\nalmost anything would be a fair price for getting Leo out of his\nmaternal fortress.\n\nThen there was the day when Len came home to find Moira weeping over\nthe typewriter, with a half-inch stack of manuscript beside her.\n\n\"It isn't anything. I'm just tired. He started this after lunch.\nLook.\"\n\nLen turned the face-down sheaf the right way up.\n\n  Droning. Abrasing\n  the demiurge.\n  Hier begrimms the tale:\n  Eyes undotted, grewling\n  and looking, turns off\n  a larm, seizes cloes.\n  Stewed Bierly a wretch\n  Pence, therefore tchews we. Pons!\n  Let the pants take air of themsulves.\n\n\n\nThe first three sheets were all like that. The fourth was a perfectly\ngood Petrarchian sonnet reviling the current administration and the\npolitical party of which Len was a registration-day member.\n\nThe fifth was hand-lettered in the Cyrillic alphabet and illustrated\nwith geometric diagrams. Len put it down and stared shakily at Moira.\n\n\"No, go on,\" she said, \"read the rest.\"\n\nThe sixth and seventh were obscene limericks; and the eighth, ninth\nand so on to the end of the stack were what looked like the first\nchapters of a rattling good historical adventure novel.\n\nIts chief characters were Cyrus the Great, his jaunty-bosomed daughter\nLygea, of whom Len had never previously heard, and a one-armed\nGraeco-Mede adventurer named Xanthes. There were also courtesans,\nspies, apparitions, scullery slaves, oracles, cutthroats, lepers,\npriests and men-at-arms in magnificent profusion.\n\n\"He's decided,\" said Moira, \"what he wants to be when he's born.\"\n\nLeo refused to bothered with mundane details. When there were eighty\npages of the manuscript, it was Moira who invented a title and by-line\nfor it--_The Virgin of Persepolis_ by Leon Lenn--and mailed it off to\na literary agent in New York. His response, a week later, was\ncautiously enthusiastic. He asked for an outline of the remainder of\nthe novel.\n\nMoira replied that this was impossible, trying to sound as unworldly\nand impenetrably artistic as she could. She enclosed the thirty-odd\npages Leo had turned out through her in the meantime.\n\nNothing was heard from the agent for two weeks. At the end of this\ntime, Moira received an astonishing document, exquisitely printed and\nbound in imitation leather, thirty-two pages including the index,\ncontaining three times as many clauses as a lease.\n\nThis turned out to be a book contract. With it came the agent's check\nfor nine hundred dollars.\n\n\n\nLen tilted his mop-handle against the wall and straightened carefully,\nconscious of every individual gritty muscle in his back. How did women\ndo housework every day, seven days a week, fifty-two goddam weeks a\nyear?\n\nIt was a little cooler now that the Sun was down, and he was working\nstripped to shorts and bath slippers; but he might as well have been\nwearing an overcoat in a Turkish bath.\n\nThe faint whisper of Moira's monstrous new electrical typewriter\nstopped, leaving a fainter hum. Len went into the living room and\nsagged on the arm of a chair. Moira, gleaming sweatily in a flowered\nhousecoat, was lighting a cigarette.\n\n\"How's it going?\" he asked, hoping for an answer. He hadn't always\nreceived one.\n\nShe switched off the machine wearily. \"Page two-eighty-nine. Xanthes\nkilled Anaxander.\"\n\n\"Thought he would. How about Ganesh and Zeuxias?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" She frowned. \"I can't figure it out. You know who it\nwas that raped Marianne in the garden?\"\n\n\"No, who?\"\n\n\"Ganesh.\"\n\n\"You're kidding!\"\n\n\"Nope.\" She pointed to the stack of typescript. \"See for yourself.\"\n\nLen didn't move. \"But Ganesh was in Lydia, buying back the sapphire.\nHe didn't return till--\"\n\n\"I know, I know. But he _wasn't_. That was Zeuxias in a putty nose\nwith his beard dyed. It's all perfectly logical, the way Leo explains\nit. Zeuxias overheard Ganesh talking to the three Mongols--you\nremember, Ganesh thought there was somebody behind the curtain, only\nthat was when they heard Lygea scream, and while their backs were\nturned--\"\n\n\"All right. But for God's sake, this fouls everything up. If Ganesh\nnever went to Lydia, then he _couldn't_ have had anything to do\ndistempering Cyrus's armor. And Zeuxias couldn't, either, because--\"\n\n\"It's exasperating. I know he's going to pull another rabbit out of\nthe hat and clear everything up, but I don't see how.\"\n\nLen brooded. \"It beats me. It had to be either Ganesh or Zeuxias. Or\nPhilomenes, though that doesn't seem possible. Look, damn it, if\nZeuxias knew about the sapphire all the time, that rules out\nPhilomenes once and for all. Unless--no. I forgot about that business\nin the temple. Umm. Do you think Leo really knows what he's doing?\"\n\n\"I'm certain. Lately I've been able to tell what he's thinking even\nwhen he isn't talking to me. I mean just generally, like when he's\npuzzling over something, or when he's feeling mean. It's going to be\nsomething brilliant and he knows what it is, but he won't tell me.\nWe'll just have to wait.\"\n\n\"I guess so.\" Len stood up, grunting. \"You want me to see if there's\nanything in the pot?\"\n\n\"Please.\"\n\nLen wandered into the kitchen, turned the flame on under the silex,\nstared briefly at the dishes waiting in the sink, and wandered out\nagain. Since the onslaught of The Novel, Leo had relinquished his\ninterest in Moira's diet, and she had been living on coffee. Small\nblessings....\n\n\n\nMoira was leaning back with her eyes closed, looking very tired.\n\"How's the money?\" she asked without moving.\n\n\"Lousy. We're down to twenty-one bucks.\"\n\nShe raised her head and opened her eyes wide. \"We couldn't be! Len,\nhow could anybody go through nine hundred dollars that fast?\"\n\n\"Typewriter. And the dictaphone that Leo thought he wanted, till about\nhalf an hour after it was paid for. We spent less than fifty on\nourselves, I think. Rent. Groceries. It goes, when there isn't any\ncoming in.\"\n\nShe sighed. \"I thought it would last longer.\"\n\n\"So did I. If he doesn't finish this thing in a few days, I'll have to\ngo look for work again.\"\n\n\"Oh. That isn't so good. How am I going to take care of the house and\ndo Leo's writing for him?\"\n\n\"I know, but--\"\n\n\"All right. If it works out, fine. If it doesn't--he must be near the\nend by now.\" She stubbed out her cigarette abruptly and sat up, hands\nover the keyboard. \"He's getting ready again. See about that coffee,\nwill you? I'm half dead.\"\n\nLen poured two cups and carried them in. Moira was still sitting\npoised in front of the typewriter, with a curious half-formed\nexpression on her face.\n\nAbruptly the carriage whipped over, muttered to itself briefly and\nthumped the paper up twice. Then it stopped. Moira's eyes got bigger\nand rounder.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" said Len. He looked over her shoulder.\n\nThe last line on the page read:\n\nTO BE CONTINUED IN OUR NEXT\n\nMoira's hands curled into small helpless fists. After a moment, she\nturned off the machine.\n\n\"What?\" said Len incredulously. \"To be continued--what kind of talk is\nthat?\"\n\n\"He says he's bored with the novel,\" Moira replied dully. \"He says he\nknows the ending, so it's artistically complete; it doesn't matter\nwhether anybody else thinks so or not.\" She paused. \"But he says that\nisn't the real reason.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"He's got two reasons. One is that he doesn't want to finish the book\ntill he's certain he'll have complete control of the money it earns.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Len, swallowing a lump of anger, \"that makes a certain\namount of sense. It's his book. If he wants guarantees....\"\n\n\"You haven't heard the other one.\"\n\n\"All right, let's have it.\"\n\n\"He wants to teach us--so we'll never forget--who the boss is in this\nfamily.\"\n\n\n\n\"Len, I'm awfully tired,\" Moira complained piteously, late that night.\n\n\"Let's just go over it once more. There has to be some way. He still\nisn't talking to you?\"\n\n\"I haven't felt anything from him for the last twenty minutes. I think\nhe's asleep.\"\n\n\"All right, let's suppose he _isn't_ going to listen to reason--\"\n\n\"I think we'd better.\"\n\nLen made an incoherent noise. \"Well, okay. I still don't see why we\ncan't write the last chapter ourselves. It'd only be a few pages.\"\n\n\"Go ahead and try.\"\n\n\"Not me. You've done a little writing. Damned good, too. And if you're\nso sure all the clues are there--Look, if you say you can't do it, all\nright, we'll hire somebody. A professional writer. It happens all the\ntime. Thorne Smith's last novel--\"\n\n\"It wasn't Thorne Smith's and it wasn't a novel,\" she said\ndogmatically.\n\n\"But it sold. What one writer starts, another can finish.\"\n\n\"Nobody ever finished _The Mystery of Edwin Drood_.\"\n\n\"Oh, hell.\"\n\n\"Len, it's impossible. It is! Let me finish--if you're thinking we\ncould have somebody rewrite the last part Leo did--\"\n\n\"Yeah, I just thought of that.\"\n\n\"--even that wouldn't do any good. You'd have to go all the way back,\nalmost to page one. It would be another story when you got through.\nLet's go to bed.\"\n\n\"Moy, do you remember when we used to worry about the law of\nopposites?\"\n\n\"Mm?\"\n\n\"The law of _opposites_. When we used to be afraid the kid would turn\nout to be a pick-and-shovel man with a pointy head.\"\n\n\"Uh. Mm.\"\n\nHe turned. Moira was standing with one hand on her belly and the other\nbehind her back. She looked as if she were about to start practicing a\nlow bow and doubted she could make it.\n\n\"What's the matter now?\" he asked.\n\n\"Pain in the small of my back.\"\n\n\"Bad one?\"\n\n\"No....\"\n\n\"Belly hurt, too?\"\n\nShe frowned. \"Don't be foolish. I'm feeling for the contraction. There\nit comes.\"\n\n\"The--but you just said the small of your back.\"\n\n\"Where do you think labor pains usually start?\"\n\n\n\nThe pains were coming at twenty-minute intervals and the taxi had not\narrived. Moira was packed and ready. Len was trying to set her a good\nexample by remaining calm. He strolled over to the wall calendar,\ngazed at it in an offhand manner, and turned away.\n\n\"Len, I know it's only the fifteenth of July,\" she said impatiently.\n\n\"Huh? I didn't say anything about that.\"\n\n\"You said it seven times. Sit down. You're making me nervous.\"\n\nLen perched on the corner of the table, folded his arms, and\nimmediately got up to look out the window. On the way back, he circled\nthe table in an aimless way, picked up a bottle of ink and shook it to\nsee if the cap was on tight, stumbled over a wastebasket, carefully\nup-ended it, and sat down with an air of _Ici je suis, ici je reste_.\n\n\"Nothing to worry about,\" he said firmly. \"Women have kids all the\ntime.\"\n\n\"True.\"\n\n\"What for?\" he demanded violently.\n\nMoira grinned at him, then winced slightly and looked at the clock.\n\"Eighteen minutes this time. They're getting closer.\"\n\nWhen she relaxed, Len put a cigarette in his mouth and lighted it in\nonly two tries. \"How's Leo taking it?\"\n\n\"Isn't saying. He feels--\" she concentrated--\"apprehensive. He tells\nme he's feeling strange and he doesn't like it. I don't think he's\nentirely awake. Funny--\"\n\n\"I'm glad this is happening now,\" Len announced.\n\n\"So am I, but--\"\n\n\"Look,\" said Len, moving energetically to the arm of her chair. \"We've\nalways had it pretty good, haven't we? Not that it hasn't been tough\nat times, but--you know.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"Well, that's the way it'll be again, once this is over. I don't care\nhow much of a superbrain he is, once he's born--you know what I mean?\nThe only reason he's had the edge on us all this time is he could get\nat us and we couldn't get at him. If he's got the mind of an adult, he\ncan learn to act like one. It's that simple.\"\n\nMoira hesitated. \"You can't take him out to the woodshed. He's going\nto be a helpless baby, physically, like anybody else's. He has to be\ntaken care of.\"\n\n\"All right, there are plenty of other ways. If he behaves, he gets\nread to. Things like that.\"\n\n\"That's right, but there's one other thing I thought of. You remember\nwhen you said suppose he's asleep and dreaming, and what happens if he\nwakes up?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"That reminded me of something else, or maybe it's the same thing. Did\nyou know that a fetus in the womb only gets about half the amount of\noxygen in his blood that he'll have when he starts to breathe?\"\n\nLen looked thoughtful. \"I forgot. Well, that's just one more thing Leo\ndoes that babies aren't supposed to do.\"\n\n\"Use as much energy as he does, you mean. What I'm getting at is, it\ncan't be because he's getting more than the normal amount of oxygen,\ncan it? I mean he's the prodigy, not me. He must be using it more\nefficiently. And if that's it, what will happen when he gets twice as\nmuch?\"\n\n\n\nThey had prepared and disinfected her, along with other indignities,\nand now she could see herself in the reflector of the big\ndelivery-table light--the image clear and bright, like everything\nelse, but very haloed and swimmy, and looking like a bad statue of\nSita. She had no idea how long she had been here--that was the dope,\nprobably--but she was getting pretty tired.\n\n\"Bear down,\" said the staff doctor kindly, and before she could\nanswer, the pain came up like violins and she had to gulp at the\ntingly coldness of laughing gas.\n\nWhen the mask lifted, she said, \"I _am_ bearing down,\" but the doctor\nhad gone back to work and wasn't listening.\n\nAnyhow, she had Leo. _How are you feeling?_\n\nHis answer was muddled--because of the anesthetic?--but she didn't\nreally need it. Her perception of him was clear: darkness and\npressure, impatience, a slow Satanic anger ... and something else.\nUncertainty? Dread?\n\n\"Two or three more ought to do it. Bear down.\"\n\nFear. Unmistakable now. And a desperate determination--\n\n\"Doctor, he doesn't want to be born!\"\n\n\"Seems that way sometimes, doesn't it? Now bear down good and hard.\"\n\n_Tell him stop blurrrr too dangerrrr stop I feel worrrr stop I\ntellrrrr stop_\n\n\"What, Leo? What?\"\n\n\"Bear down,\" the doctor said abstractedly.\n\nFaintly, like a voice under water, gasping before it drowns: _Hurry I\nhate you tell him sealed incubator tenth oxygen nine-tenths inert\ngases hurry hurry hurry_\n\n\"An incubator!\" she panted. \"He'll need an incubator ... to live ...\nwon't he?\"\n\n\"Not this baby. A fine, normal, healthy one.\"\n\n_He's idiot lying stupid fool need incubator tenth oxygen tenth tenth\nhurry before it's_\n\nThe pressure abruptly ceased.\n\nLeo was born.\n\nThe doctor was holding him up by the heels, red, wrinkled, puny. But\nthe voice was still there, very small, very far away: _Too late same\nas death_\n\nThen a hint of the old cold arrogance: _Now you'll never know who\nkilled Cyrus._\n\nThe doctor slapped him smartly on the minuscule behind. The wizened,\nmalevolent face writhed open, but it was only the angry squall of an\nordinary infant that came out.\n\nLeo was gone, like a light turned off beneath the measureless ocean.\n\nMoira raised her head weakly.\n\n\"Give him one for me,\" she said.\n\n                                                         --DAMON KNIGHT\n\n",
