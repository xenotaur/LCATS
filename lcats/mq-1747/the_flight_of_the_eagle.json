    "body": "Humans are a strange breed. Forgetful. They grow accustomed to the\nwonders they live among so easily that they never really figure up the\ncost. A little time passes and the bright memories tarnish and are\ncovered over with newer ones. And the men who picked up the check and\nmaybe paid with their lives? Forgotten.\n\nFor example, when you're sitting comfortably in the New York to San\nFrancisco stratojet, and you take the trouble to look down at the\nlush verdure of the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada, do you ever\nremember that a few short years back that lovely fertile parkland was\na rocky, barren waste? Or when you taste the delicious tropical fruits\nthat are brought to your table from the Mojave Basin, do you think of\nBat Kendo, the man who made all that possible? Like fun you do! I'll\ngive you ten to one you never heard of Bat Kendo. Maybe you don't even\nknow that the reason those once sterile wastelands are now the larders\nof the North American continent is ... weather-plant. And I'll give\neight to five you don't even know where that weather-plant came from,\nor how it got here, or what it cost. Not in money ... in lives.\n\nWell, I know, and for once I'd like to have someone stand still long\nenough so I could tell the story. The minute anyone sees an old\nspaceman like me coming, they jet the hell out of there fast. \"Old\nCaptain Morley's got another shaggy dog to comb out!\" they say, and\nbeat it. My stories, it seems, are too old fashioned for this modern\nage. Just because I, and a lot of others like me--only maybe not so\nlucky--spent our lives opening up the spaceways instead of sitting home\non our venturiis, we're \"odd characters\" and \"old space-hacks,\" and our\nstories are tall tales--yarns to be avoided, or laughed at if it's not\npossible to avoid them.\n\nOkay, I expect that. But I still want to tell how that weather-plant\ncame to be where it is now, and what Bat Kendo had to do with it. He\nwas my shipmate on the R. S. _Eagle_, and I think he's got a little\ncredit coming to him.\n\nThe history books will tell you that during the last few years of the\n20th Century the population of North America increased by something\nlike 600 per cent. They might even tell you that this put such a load\non the continental resources--food, mainly--that famine became a\npossibility for the first time in the history of the continent. Things\nwere pretty tight. People were actually starving amid the technological\nwonders of the time. Hydroponics were tried, but they fizzled badly.\n\nThe only answer seemed to be complete utilization of all available\nland area for food production. And that meant that a lot of land that\ncouldn't grow weeds had to produce edible crops. That's the way things\nstood back in '02, just after the William Robert Holcomb Foundation's\nR. S. _Explorer_ returned from Venus with what the botanists thought\nmight be an answer.\n\nOf course, the Earth-Luna System was well traveled even then, but it\ntook the big money of the Holcomb Foundation plus a whopping World\nFederal Government grant to make a deep space mission feasible.\n\nIt was a Holcomb Foundation metallurgist's synthesis of impervium\nthat made deep space navigable. Before this time all ships were\nchemical-fuelled because the weight of lead needed to shield atomics\nwould nail any spacer built to terra firma ... but good. Chemical ships\ncould make Luna, but no farther. Lucky to get that far with the pumps\nfeeding the jets a stream of monoatomic hydrogen as thick as your\narm. A ship could carry about enough juice to get up the necessary\nseven-a-second with maybe enough for landing ... maybe. Even then\nplenty of ships that carried a pound or two of mass too much arced\nback to Earth and splashed themselves all over the ground. Others got\nup escape-velocity only to run dry trying to land on Luna. Their metal\nbones are still up there; if you care to look for them.\n\nImpervium changed all that. Here was a metal that was easily worked, as\nlight as a good quality aluminum-magnesium alloy, and strong as steel.\nAnd it was impervious to everything except neutrino bombardment. That\nwas the ticket to deep space. Atomics were in and chemicals out. I\nmight add that none of us were sorry to see them go, either.\n\nLuna remained the jumping-off place. And Foy City was the staging area\nfor trips to ... UP. Before the successful flight of the _Explorer_,\nFoy had been just a combination mining and scientific camp. After the\n_Explorer_ returned from Venus, spacemen began to pour up from Earth,\nand Foy City became one of the rowdiest places under Sol. Jetmen and\npilots, tubemen and ABs, all the restless flotsam of humanity flowed up\nto Luna in a steady stream to mingle with the miners from the Diggings\nand the longhairs from the Cosmiray Labs and the big dome of Starview.\n\nMars was reached and colonization began. And men set up a settlement on\nVenus. The Holcomb Foundation was convinced that they had the answer\nto the critical food shortage on Earth. Weather-plant. The one useful\nthing that stinking Venus produces.\n\nWeather-plant is a moss-like plant that will grow almost anywhere.\nThe Foundation botanists found that it gathered nitrogen and\nwater in some inexplicable way, and they became interested in its\npossibilities. Something had to be done about soil reclamation back\non Earth, or starvation would strangle the race. Weather-plant looked\nlike the answer. What the smart boys couldn't have guessed was that\nin addition to its other strange properties, weather-plant was\nintelligent--sentient, at least. And they didn't know that it liked its\nwet, foggy environment very, very much.\n\n\n\nI hit Foy City with a mammoth thirst and very little spending money.\nA bad combination. I had a Pilot's rating and a brand-new Second\nOfficer's ticket, and I needed a job.\n\nI'd been handling a regular chemical flight out of Foy to Montevideo\nfor a one horse concern that was still trying to make the low grade\nuranium ore found on the Moon pay off. When I came down onto the great\npumice plain of Mare Imbrium that served Foy as a spaceport, the\npatched-up blow-torch I was jockeying blew a venturi and buried herself\nunder twenty feet of pumice. If it had happened on Earth, we'd have\nbeen cooked, but Luna's one-sixth gravity saved our hides. Those were\nthe days before tractor-pressor beam landings, you see. Back then you\nlanded a can by balancing her on her tail-flare like a ball on a water\nspout. And that was a rough go anyway you want to look at it.\n\nAnyway, after the pileup I quit. There was some difference of opinion\non that particular point between the company and me. They claimed I was\nfired.\n\nQuit or fired, however, I didn't get paid, and that led me to seek\nsolace in the local pubs. That, in turn, led me to the city drunk-tank\nfor the night, and that's where I ran into Bat Kendo....\n\nBat was Chief Tubeman on the R. S. _Eagle_. He was also a mutation.\nNot that he wasn't human or anything like that. And he certainly\nwasn't the much kicked around \"homo superior.\" He merely had an extra\nsense. We all have it dormant. Bat had it well developed. That's why\nhe was called Bat. People thought he could see in the dark. It wasn't\nthat. Try closing your eyes and moving your head slowly toward an\nobstruction. If you are very careful and very alert, you'll be able to\nsense the obstruction before you touch it. Well, Bat could \"see\" things\nthat way ... perfectly. He even used to pick up beer money by getting\ninto the ring blindfolded and letting pugs throw punches at him. They\nhit him, but not often. And when they did connect it wasn't because he\ndidn't sense the blows coming; it was because he was slow on his feet\nand generally three quarters drunk.\n\nBat's father, Nakano Kendo, had grown up in Nagasaki. He'd been exposed\nto radiation by the second atom blast there. Bat had befuddled the\ngeneticists by showing up a mutation one generation before he was\nsupposed to. He used to laugh about that.\n\nHis mother had been Russian. Certainly you couldn't tell his\nnationality by looking at him. His face held a suggestion of the\nAsiatic, but trying to place him anthropologically would have been as\ndifficult as finding a pure Anglo-Saxon, whatever that is.\n\nBat was just the product of an insane age. A child of a man whose germ\nplasm had been dosed with radiation. But for all of that Bat Kendo was\nnormal. Two arms, two legs, two eyes. Only his built-in radar marked\nhim as different. That, and his terrific taste for booze. I never\nsaw him sober. Yet to see him, you'd never guess he was perpetually\nsaturated. There may have been bigger drunks in space, but I never knew\none.\n\nAs a tubeman, he never had an equal. As an all around right guy, he\nnever will have.\n\nIt was Bat that talked me into signing on the _Eagle_. They needed a\nPilot, and where a better place to find one than in the Foy City drunk\ntank? I knew the _Eagle_, of course. Everyone in the Luna-Earth System\ndid. She was a five hundred tonner, newly converted to atomics and\nfitting in the Foundation yards for a flight to Venusberg.\n\nShe was going to pick up a full cargo of weather-plant from the\nsettlement. A hundred tons of it. And brother, that's a lot of\nweather-plant.\n\nThis was to be the first quantity shipment of the stuff. The\n\"pilot-shipment.\" The botanists suspected a lot and had great hopes.\nBut it was up to the _Eagle_ to get the stuff to Earth. She was the\nonly ship available for the trip with enough storage space for the\nplant, and when I listened to Bat talk about it, the flight began to\ntake on the aspect of a mercy mission.\n\nI knew people were going hungry back Earthside, and old Bat was really\nsteamed up about it. I dare say if it hadn't been for his pep talk I'd\nnever have signed on. Deep space was still new, and I liked living.\nBut Bat talked me into it, and as soon as the turnkey shook us out of\nthe sack and shooed us out, Bat and I headed for the Foundation yards\nand the _Eagle_.\n\nMy first view of the ship didn't do much to make me happy about the\ntrip. She looked old and scabrous standing tall on her tail fins out on\nthe flat, glaring plain of Mare Imbrium. Her hull was meteor-scarred\nand eroded by atmospheric friction, and there seemed to be an abundance\nof patch-welds on her.\n\nHer tubes, however, were spanking brand new, and after I had inspected\nher control-tube-pile system--as all prospective pilots have a right to\ndo--in company with Bat and Captain Reynard, I signed.\n\nReynard was a decent enough skipper. He wasn't much of a\ndisciplinarian, but the boat only carried a crew of twenty, so that was\nno problem. As an astrogator, he had quite a reputation, and he'd been\nout to Venus before on one of the ships that lugged the settlers and\nscientific personnel out there.\n\nThere wasn't much fanfare when the time came for our departure. Ships\nwere lifting every day for Mars just then, and the departure of one\nfor Venus didn't seem important. Before we left though, a Holcomb\nFoundation man came aboard and spoke to us about the importance of\nour trip. He said that if we didn't bring back the weather-plant in\ngood shape, things might turn nasty on Earth. It would be another year\nand a half before Venus and Earth came into conjunction again, and by\nthat time it might be too late for the thousands who were going hungry\nback home. It gave us a sense of responsibility, all right. And it\nparticularly had an effect on Bat.\n\n\n\nWe lifted from Mare Imbrium on 11/9/02 Earth Date. I recall that I\ngave her 2G, easing her up to 6G and holding that acceleration for\nsixty hours. By that time our speed in MPH wouldn't have made sense.\nI revelled in the power under my hands, and the feeling that I could\nactually waste an erg or two without having to worry myself bald about\nlanding. The _Eagle_ carried fifty pounds of ingot thorium as fuel,\nand with our new atomics, that would have taken us to Centaurus, if\nwe'd had the time. It was wonderful to be able to keep the boat under\na steady 1G all the way to turn-over instead of having to endure the\nendless nausea of free-fall. Even seasoned spacemen never got used to\nfree-fall, and atomics eliminated it, thank God!\n\nThe sunward flight was something to remember for sheer beauty. Earth\nand Luna faded astern until they were just a bright point of light.\nThe sun blazed like a ball of white fire ahead of us, and Venus grew\nbrighter and brighter against the breath-taking backdrop of the Milky\nWay. It was a gorgeous sight--but frightening, too. I had the feeling\nthat I was terribly exposed, as though I were standing balanced atop\nthe spire of the Holcomb Tower, five hundred stories above the teeming\nstreets of New York. Agoraphobia, I think the psychs call it. The\nothers felt it too. In fact one of the jetmen went slightly off his\nrocker and had to be jugged. But most of the men came through the first\nfear of deep space well enough, and as an astrogator Captain Reynard\nwas strictly one hundred per cent.\n\nI didn't see much of Bat on the trip, since he was down in the heavily\nsheathed tuberoom with his \"black-gang.\" But I could tell whenever he\nwas on watch, because if I turned the interphone on without warning, I\ncould almost invariably hear his beery baritone singing the praises of:\n\n    \"That Lulu! Belle of ol' Foy City\n    Who wears two hammocks....\"\n\nBat was something of a poet, in his lighter moments--though most of his\nstuff was lamentably unprintable.\n\nI did get in on one little session with him and about a dozen of the\ncrew. That was down in the forecastle where he was entertaining the\noff-watches by letting them blindfold him and then try to hide a bottle\nof the tetrant alky we called our \"rations.\" Naturally, he always\nfound it, and naturally he always drank it. It took them most of the\nsunward trip to wise up to the fact that he was a mutation with his own\ndetecting system already built-in--courtesy of the Manhattan Project\nand Nakano Kendo's irradiated gametes. The crew lost most of its alky\nrations that way, and old Bat soaked the stuff up like a sponge.\n\nWe passed turn-over point and then the long fall down to Venus\nbegan--three weeks of it.\n\nContact was established with the settlement while we were still\nabove the stratosphere, and our Ultra-wave-radar went into action,\nthe endless scanning that is absolutely essential to the landing of\nspacecraft through cloud layers.\n\nI don't mind admitting that there was a cold sweat on my brow when I\nstarted down through the soup. The reports from UVR indicated plenty\nof clearance from the mountains, but I was still leery. Some of those\npeaks are reported to be as high as 200,000 feet. The _Eagle's_ gyros\nwere screaming and the muffled thunder of the jets filtered through\nevery plate of her. I'd let her slide a bit and then snatch her up\nwith a blast of the jets. Each time I touched the firing consoles, I\ncould hear the moan of the blasted atomic particles rushing through\nthe venturiis, and I could see the glitter of the cloud moisture that\nhugged the ports as it absorbed lethal radiations from the tail-flare.\n\nThen the clouds began to thin and I could make out the pattern of the\nspaceport beneath us through the billowing formaldehyde mists that\nserve Venus for an atmosphere.\n\nI was a wreck by the time the _Eagle's_ fins touched the ground and the\ndancing fire of the tubes flickered and died. I felt her sag as she\nsank slightly into the mushy soil, and then I was cutting the power\nswitches and listening to the slowly descending whine of the gyros as\nthey coasted silkily to a halt.\n\nI looked out of the ports at the miasmic swamp that surrounded us, at\nthe fifty foot ferns in ghastly colors, at the alien, repellent trees\nthat grew pulpy and squat all around the settlement. This was Venus....\n\n\n\nVenusberg wasn't the great domed city then that it is now. Back in\n'02 it was just a group of pressurized Quonset huts. There were about\nsixty men there, mostly maintenance workers and horticulturalists, and\nfive women. Four women were scientists, the fifth Bat Kendo spent his\nplanet-leave with.\n\nThe settlers were very cordial with us. I guess we must have been like\na breath of the home world to these poor characters who lived there.\n\nI accompanied Captain Reynard on a tour of the cultivated areas and the\nsettlement itself. We were shown how the weather-plant was cultivated\nand how it gathered nitrogen and water out of the fetid air to deposit\nit in the soil. We saw how there were always banks of mist over the\nrows of plants. It gave me quite a shock when I reached down to touch\nsome and the stuff actually shied away from my pressure-suit glove.\n\n\"We suspect that the stuff might actually be sentient,\" the settlement\nbotanist told us.\n\n\"You mean the stuff _thinks_?\" Captain Reynard demanded.\n\nThe botanist laughed. \"Oh, no. It's just that when there is a\nconsiderable amount of the stuff about it reacts peculiarly. As soon as\nthis ship load of yours gets to Earth, the Foundation staff can really\nget to work with it and see just what all it can do. We've great hopes\nfor it. It may be the answer to starvation back home.\"\n\nI looked out over the neat rows of tiny plants that vanished in the\nmisty distance, and I looked too, at the pressing jungle. I began to\nget a queasy feeling in my stomach. This was alien life. Life that had\nnever been meant for Earth's clean soil. There was no telling what the\nstuff might do away from here.\n\n\"We suspect,\" the botanist was saying, \"that the high formaldehyde\ncontent of Venus' atmosphere has an inhibiting effect on the action of\nthe plant. We have isolated small amounts in formaldehyde-free air,\nand gotten some interesting results. Freed of its native ecology, we\nbelieve the stuff can actually create its own weather.\"\n\nHis voice faded away as far as I was concerned. Somewhere in my head\na bell was trying to ring. There was something here that was escaping\nthis botanist and Captain Reynard. I couldn't put my finger on it. I\nhad the crazy feeling that something, like the Purloined Letter, was\nhidden here. Something obvious, something that could be, under the\nproper circumstances, dangerous.\n\nBut I didn't figure it out. Not just then. Not until it was too late.\nAll the clues were there; the plant and the way it could gather\nwater vapor and nitrogen, the threat of taking it from its native\necology. Everything. But I didn't tumble. Not until it was too late and\nthe obvious had taken a toll. In lives....\n\nOn 23/35/02 Venus Date the _Eagle_ was fully loaded and ready for the\nlong haul back up to Earth. The colonists gathered to bid us farewell,\nand the party was a corker. Bat did his human radar act somewhere\nalong about the time the fifteenth libation was poured. He was at his\nextra-normal best, telling astounded colonists just what they were\ndoing with their pinkies at ranges up to three hundred yards in pitch\ndarkness. I could have told them that he was almost as good as UVR, but\nthat might have spoiled the effect.\n\nThree hours later we had bid an enthusiastic good-bye to that mushy\nball of swamp and stench those poor colonials called home, and the\nvalves sighed shut in the _Eagle's_ flanks. The loading cranes pulled\naway and our own were retracted. The ramp was cleared and the lift-ship\nalarm blared through the _Eagle_.\n\nThe gyros reached operating RPM and I let my hands play over the\nconsoles. The boat shuddered and lifted slowly on a tail of fire. I fed\nher more power and the accelerometer moved up to 2G. I held her there\nuntil we broke out of the clouds and into the crystalline cobalt of the\nionosphere. I swung the power lever over and the _Eagle_ leaped upward,\nher needle-nose pointed for home.\n\nWe were well past turn-over, in fact just about nineteen hours from\nEarth when things began happening.\n\nBat called Control, his voice tense with excitement. \"Morley! There's\nsomething coming ... fast! I can feel it!\"\n\nI started to ask him what was coming in fast, and whether or not he\ncould \"see\" it clearly through the metal of the ship, but I never\nfinished. UVR flashed a red alert warning on my control panel ... and\nit was the last warning it ever gave.\n\nThe panel screeched: \"METEOR SWARM!\" and went dead. The lights\nflickered and went out as the _Eagle_ bucked and roared in protest. The\nsound of tearing metal knifed through the hull, and then the whooshing\nsound of escaping air. Alarm bells clattered futilely--bulkheads\nslammed. The ship's self-sealing mesoderm saved most of the air, but\nnot before the pressure in the boat dropped from 14.7 down to 6 lbs.\nper square inch in about two seconds and doubled me up in an agony of\naero-embolism. For a long while there was silence, and I fought the\nglittering knives of pain that seemed to be cutting me into hamburger.\nThen the lights came back on, dimly. There was still life in the old\n_Eagle_.\n\nI staggered to my feet and rang the tuberoom. A pilot's first instinct\nis to check the power. No matter what has happened to his ship, if\nthere's power there's hope.\n\n\"Morley...!\" It was Bat calling back through the interphone. \"We've had\nit down here! The sheathing is gone and I've got three men killed!\" I\ncould hear the sound of metal sizzling in the background as Bat looked\nabout for more dope to pass on. As it was it looked bad enough. If\nthe sheathing was shot, that meant that he was taking lethal doses of\nradiation even as he spoke to me.\n\n\"Bat!\" I shouted, \"Bat, you crazy fool! If that place is hot, get out\nof there!\"\n\nI got no reply.\n\n\"Bat! That's an order! Put the pile on automatic and get the hell out!\"\n\n\"No soap, Morley....\" Bat's voice seemed edged with pain. \"You know the\nautos won't last for more than thirty minutes. Strictly ... emergency\nstuff....\" And then his voice grew even tighter. \"The storage, Morley!\nThose stinking ... rocks ... took ... out ... the storage! All the\nthorium went out ... the side ... they hit ... the storage bunker!\"\n\nThat tore it. Without thorium ... without even an extra gram ... the\nbest we could hope for was making it to Earth. Luna and its lovely\none-sixth gravity for a crash landing was out.\n\nI tried to get Captain Reynard on the phone, but there was no answer\nfrom his quarters. I didn't need a diagram to figure out that he was\neither dead or so tied up with bends that he couldn't reach the phone.\n\nI started the compressors and the pressure began to build up, but the\nmesoderm patches wouldn't stand more than 9 lbs. Well, it had to do.\n\nThe griping pains eased a bit inside me and I tried to take stock of\nthe situation. Station by station, I called the crew and assessed the\ndamage. It was plenty.\n\nThe whole communications deck was gone and the only radio on board that\nworked was the tiny panel set in control. The UVR was mangled and so\nwas its crew of four men. Three tubemen had died in the tuberoom and I\ndidn't know how badly Bat might be hurt. No one could enter because the\nplace was hot. The thorium was gone and the sheathing on the pile too.\nI looked in on the Captain and scratched him off the list. Death from\nbends is not a pleasant thing to see. The _Eagle_ was my command now.\nAs pilot and Second Officer, I took over, for better or worse.\n\nI returned to Control and gave the crew a quick rundown on the\nsituation. Work parties were made up and the wreckage cleared away. The\ndead--the ones we could find--were wrapped in celoflex and consigned\nto space. I mumbled a prayer over them as they slipped out into the\nvoid. They weren't all Christians, but somehow I had a feeling that\nthey wouldn't mind too much. There's something about the immensity of\nthe cosmos that makes men relinquish their petty prejudices. And when I\ngot back into Control and watched the tell-tales on the Geiger-Muller\nCounters down in the tuberoom, I said another prayer--for Bat Kendo.\n\nI kept wondering why we had hit that meteor swarm. The normal chances\nof such an encounter are in the vicinity of a thousand to one. Bits of\nmemory kept tugging at me, but I couldn't get things properly trimmed\nup until a call from Bat in the tuberoom furnished the key.\n\n\"Morley, there's a piece of those damned rocks down here ... and it's\nmelting!\"\n\nIce! Water! Weather-plant! The pieces of the puzzle began to fit now.\nThe swarm was ice ... superhard ice ... tempered by the awful cold\nof the void. And the weather-plant in the hold--one hundred tons\nof it--had attracted it hungrily! The plant had more than just an\naffinity for water! It acted like a magnet! There had probably been\nnitrogen dissolved in the water, too, and that had added to the plant's\nattraction!\n\nA sick feeling moved into the pit of my stomach and stayed right there.\nThere was no way of jettisoning the cargo, and there wasn't enough\nfuel for a try at airless Luna! That meant....\n\nI could hear the Venusian botanist's words echo mockingly in my ears.\n\"... we suspect it can create its own weather!\"\n\nI knew real fear then. I looked at the great greenish globe of Earth\nthat grew hourly larger beneath us, and shuddered....\n\n\n\nSeventeen hours later we were into the ionosphere. My instruments\nwarned that I had just enough thorium left in the pile to keep the\n_Eagle_ up for another hour and ten minutes. The radar was gone, but\nthe weather-plant was fat and healthy.\n\nI tried to pick up a good spot for the landing. The Mojave Desert.\nChances for clear weather were better there than anywhere else, though\nI could guess even then what our chances were.\n\nThe _Eagle_ shuddered to a vibrating halt, balancing on her tail-flare\nat about twenty five miles. The gyros were climbing the sonic scale,\nsending their shrieking whine through every deck of the crippled ship.\nI looked outside, and cold sweat beaded my face. Even at this height, a\nfine mist was forming around the _Eagle_.\n\nFreed of Venus' formaldehyde atmosphere, our tons of weather-plant were\nhappily doing their job. Drawing water vapor out of Earth's air. It\nliked fog. _And it could make its own weather!_\n\nI looked at the chronometer. I had just one hour now to get this ship\ndown through this soup that clung to us--without UVR. I had one hour to\ndo the job or gravity would do it for me.\n\nI let her slip down to fifteen miles and held there, gyros protesting.\nThe mist thickened. I rang the crash alarm, sending all hands who were\nnot actually engaged in the running of the ship to their quarters and\nthe crash-hammocks. My hands were icy cold.\n\nThe _Eagle_ sank slowly down to five miles and hung there like a\nball bouncing on a jet of water. The mist billowed about us, turning\nradioactive from the vicious lashing of the tail-flare.\n\nI knew that the weather was perfectly clear perhaps two hundred yards\naway from the ship, but the weather-plant was creating the soggy\nweather it liked and I was being effectively blindfolded by the--\n\nBlindfolded!\n\nI grabbed for the interphone. \"Bat!\" I yelled, \"Bat! Can you see\nanything below?\"\n\nOld Bat knew right away what I wanted, but his answer wasn't what I\nwanted to hear. \"Too much metal under me, Morley ... too much metal.\"\nHis voice was unsteady and seamed with pain.\n\nI glanced at the chronometer. Thirty seven minutes left. And the fog\nclung to the ports.\n\n\"Morley,\" Bat sounded something like himself for just a minute. \"I've\ngot a notion. Maybe ... maybe it will work. Break out a pressure-suit\nand get the craneman on the ball. And Morley....\" Here I could imagine\nthat he was smiling. \"... break out a bottle of the skipper's bonded\nstuff, will you?\"\n\n\"What are you dreaming up?\" I demanded anxiously.\n\n\"We have to get this cargo down,\" Bat said thinly. \"You remember what\nthe Foundation man said before we left ... people need food, Morley....\"\n\n\"What are you thinking about?\" I asked again, and then as realization\ncame, I added angrily: \"Never mind that! I know what you're planning\nBat, and you can forget it! I'll get this can down all right!\"\n\nThe voice from the interphone was dry as dust. \"Like hell you will. Who\nare you kidding?\"\n\nI had no answer there. Without UVR to guide me, I was blind. I didn't\nhave a chance to get the _Eagle_ down, and we both knew it.\n\n\"I'm coming up,\" Bat said, \"The automatics can take care of things down\nhere now.\"\n\nI glanced at the chronometer. Twenty-two minutes to go. Bat was right.\nThe autos could carry on in the tuberoom now. I felt them cut into the\ncircuit.\n\nMy heart was heavy as I called a craneman into control to handle the\nequipment. Together we unlimbered a pressure-suit from the locker. Then\nI found the skipper's rations and uncorked a bottle. In a moment Bat\nwas in Control. When I saw him my stomach muscles tightened. He looked\nas though he'd been broiled. His face was a swollen mass of angry\nflesh and his clothes were seared into his hide. Every movement must\nhave been sheer hell for him, but he staggered into the suit and made\nhimself fast to the Control crane.\n\nBefore calling for the steelglas helmet, he reached thirstily for the\nskipper's bottle and took a long pull.\n\n\"Ahhh,\" he breathed, \"That's fine stuff ... real fine.\" He offered me\nthe bottle, grinning painfully. \"Have one on me, Morley....\"\n\n\n\nI let the fiery liquor drive down the lump that was sticking in my\nthroat and handed Bat the bottle. He finished it in two swallows,\nlooked at it regretfully, and tossed it aside. It landed in the corner\nof Control where it lay, rocking senselessly back and forth with the\njolting movements of the boat.\n\nBat fastened his helmet on and started for the valve. I wanted to reach\nout and stop him, but I couldn't. I wanted to say something to him ...\nbut what? How do you thank a man for buying your life with his own?\nWhat do you say to pay a man for his pain and his torture?\n\nThat's right. You don't say anything. And neither did I. You just stand\nthere and watch, with your heart a lump of lead inside you. I did that,\nand no more.\n\nHe turned toward me just as the inner valve closed on him and the\ncable he dragged behind him. \"See ya,\" he said with a clumsy wave.\nAnd then he was outside in that radioactive mist of death, riding the\ncrane out and down. Hanging by a thin cable in that stinking fog and\nusing his useless mutational powers to save the hides of his ship and\nshipmates ... _and_ the load of weather-plant that meant food to the\nstay-at-homes.\n\nThe mass-ratio altimeter gave its last reading--four miles--and then it\nwas through, its sensitive coils thrown out of phase by the mass of the\nplanetary globe under us. Here, now, was where UVR should have taken\nover.\n\nBut there was no UVR. Only a man hanging at the end of a cable in a\nglowing mist that was burning his last chance of life out of him.\n\nI heard his instructions clearly over the small panel set. \"About\nthree miles up now.\"\n\nI let the _Eagle_ down slowly. Two miles. One. Hold. Three thousand\nfeet. Two. One. Hold. Five hundred feet. Hold. Mojave Desert right\nunder us. Baldy off to the right. Lancaster about twenty miles north.\nDown easy....\n\nThe tail-flare was splashing against the desert beneath now, turning\nthe clinging mist into a ruddy shroud. A glance at the chronometer\nshowed about three minutes fuel.\n\n\"Let ... her ... down ... slow.\" Bat's voice was fading fast as the\nterrific heat seared him and the radiation burned deep.\n\nThe fuel should be gone now. No time left. Two hundred feet, one\nhundred, fifty, thirty....\n\nI heard Bat's voice sob just once through the radio. \"Oh ... dear\nGod...!\" And that was all.\n\nNo time. No fuel.\n\nSilence!\n\nThe thunder of the jets stopped abruptly, leaving a frightening void.\nThe _Eagle_ slewed about sickeningly and dropped the remaining thirty\nfeet like so much lead. There was a rending crash as her tail section\ncrumpled, battered plates sinking into the sand, and then she settled\nwearily to a halt amid the bubbling magma of atomized earth....\n\n\n\nSo the pilot-shipment of weather-plant got here all right, and it\nexceeded the Holcomb Foundation's fondest hopes. It brought fertility\nwhere there had been only barrenness. Long rows of it still bring\nrichness and life to the soil and the danger of famine is gone forever.\n\nJust remember now, the next time you take the Pacific stratojet. Look\nunder you at that garden of plenty. See the rows upon rows of richly\nbearing plants. Look too at the interstices where a tiny Venusian moss\ncalled \"weather-plant\" makes it all possible.\n\nBat Kendo? He died. He died doing what he wanted to do, and that's\nsomething. The others maybe weren't so lucky. Of course you never heard\nof Bat, or of the _Eagle_ for that matter. All this happened a long,\nlong time ago, and the old memories tarnish. Now people take their\nlives pretty much as they find it, and they never wonder about the guys\nwho made it what it is.\n\nYes, humans are a strange breed. Like I say ... forgetful. Very\nforgetful.",
