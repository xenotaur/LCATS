    "body": "On that evil planet, broken men who had once trod Earth\nknew only two things for sure. One, they all were dying at\ntwenty-five. Two, lovely Mona Darlanan was a dirty traitor.\n\n\nRod Harrow pawed futilely at the whirling sands in the gryxon mines on\nTetrarch IV. Dimly, as through a dark mist, he could see the line of\nbobbing lamps that etched the tunnel outlines. He raised his pick for\nanother weary stroke, when he noticed the slave next to him. The poor\ndevil\u2019s face was ghastly under its close-fitting helmet. It was deeply\nlined, worn--and old. Rod saw his twisted grin when the man crumpled\nagainst the rocky abutment. A despairing cackle pierced his audiphones:\n\n\u201c_I was twenty-five yesterday. I\u2019ll be glad to die!_\u201d\n\nRod eased him as he slid to the tunnel floor. He watched in bitter\nhelplessness while the stricken fingers worked their way toward glazing\neyes. Dribbles of foam spattered the inside of the man\u2019s helmet. Pity\nand a driving desire for vengeance struggled in Rod\u2019s mind when the\nslave\u2019s feeble shout died away. The doomed man\u2019s feet beat a weak\ntattoo on the sandy floor. The beat quickened spasmodically--and\nstopped.\n\nSmoke issued from the inert nostrils. It clouded the froth-filled\nhelmet. Hazily, the dead face took on a greenish glow. It glimmered\nlike a crucified Satan for a moment, and then fell away to dry embers.\n\nAn eerie glow flashed. Rod knew, after only a day in the mines,\nthat the tetrarchian guards were now on their way. Black-browed and\nhuge--with their curiously similar features--they came to drag away the\ncorpse.\n\nA sniveling slave on Rod\u2019s left stopped to watch them. A guard turned\nand raised his weapon suggestively. The sniveler bent to his digging\nwith renewed vigor.\n\nWhen the tetrarchs had gone another slave slipped in to take the place\nleft vacant by the dead man.\n\nRod winced in the act of lifting his pick. The gash he had taken in\nhis arm before he was captured on Earth was far from healed. He saw\nthen that the new slave was a woman. She was young and slender. Her\nhair was glowing gold in the dim lit tunnel. Under her broad forehead\nher eyes were an unfathomable grey.\n\n\u201cMona Darlanan!\u201d he breathed in wonderment.\n\nEven in the mines--in the serfdom of Tetrarch--her beauty caught him.\nThis was the girl who would always make him uncomfortable ... as it had\nback in the old days--when Earth was free. She had gone on the stage.\nHe had buried himself in a science laboratory. They had lost touch.\nWhen the tetrarchs overran Earth he had lost all knowledge of her.\nBesides, he had been busy ... busy on the most important project of\nEarth\u2019s Thirtieth Century A.D.\n\n\u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d he asked. He felt awkward. This was not\nthe way he had pictured their meeting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in the mines longer than you have.\u201d Her face was quiet,\nalmost submissive. \u201cDon\u2019t talk, or the guards will be back. Besides, I\nwant to change places with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? Does it make any difference?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d She brushed him aside impatiently and turned to the sniveling\nyouth at his side.\n\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d she asked anxiously.\n\n\u201cThey almost killed me,\u201d the whimpering slave was trembling.\n\n\u201cOh, Jerry!\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope we win them over.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know now that\u2019s the only way.\u201d The girl looked about her furtively,\n\u201cI\u2019ve been talking to Latham Koler....\u201d\n\nRod swung his pick with a vicious twist and unearthed a red cloud of\nMercury oxide. His reaction boiled like the crimson dust as it mingled\nwith the swirling sand in the tunnel. When he\u2019d gotten control of\nhimself he spoke flatly.\n\n\u201cA man just died here,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t taint his death with a\ntraitor\u2019s name.\u201d\n\n\u201cLatham Koler\u2019s not a traitor!\u201d the girl flashed. \u201cAt least he has\nenough influence to get some of us out of the mines.\u201d\n\nRod eyed her angrily. The memory of the human torch ripped words from\nhim.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re humans! Remember? From Earth! There was a time when a human from\nEarth would prefer dying to licking a conqueror\u2019s boots!\u201d\n\nMona shrugged her shoulders. She swung a pick on a gryxon outcropping.\n\u201cThat may be,\u201d she said briefly, \u201cbut we\u2019re slaves now. And we die\nwithin a day or so of our twenty-fifth birthday. If Latham Koler can\nget Jerry out of the mines,\u201d Mona indicated the youth by her side,\n\u201cI\u2019ll mention his name--I\u2019ll do anything--if Jerry can be saved.\u201d\n\nJerry patted her shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019ll help us, I know,\u201d he soothed.\n\nRod Harrow bent to wisp sandy ice from a blob of red oxide. He put the\ncrimson dust into his pocket.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be in the slave compartment tonight?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe girl turned to her work. \u201cThere\u2019s no place else except the sleeping\ncubicles. I suppose I\u2019ll be there. When will you be twenty-five?\u201d she\nasked abruptly.\n\n\u201cOne month from today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why ...\u201d Mona\u2019s voice died away as the guards worked\ntheir way down the tunnel. They were herding the humans back to the\nslave compartment for the night.\n\n\n\nRod Harrow entered the compartment for the first time. He was one of\nthe last on Earth to be captured and sent on the slave ship to Tetrarch\nIV. His eyes were narrow, waiting for the first sign of inevitable\nrecognition.\n\nHe had divested himself of his tight, transparent space suit. Heated\nspace suits were necessary on Tetrarch IV, except in the compartments\nassigned to human slaves. In them there was air and heat. The planet\nitself was bitterly cold. Its only atmosphere was inert Krypton which\nthe tetrarchians breathe. Through this dead gas activated sand coursed\nin eternal swirls.\n\nSlaves were pouring through the door in droves. There were no oldsters\nin this crowd. None over twenty-five. Earth\u2019s two hundred year life\nspan had been considerably reduced.\n\nA hard-thewed, ice-eyed youngster recognized him first. Steel fingers\nclosed on Rod\u2019s wrist.\n\n\u201cRod Harrow!\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019m Don Rickter. I thought you were\nholding out on Earth.\u201d\n\nRod kept his eyes on a card game that had started. \u201cI left our hideaway\nin the Rockies when I found out how I could help up here. There was no\nway of getting here except by the slave route.\u201d He paused thoughtfully.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been idle on Earth--the few of us that are left.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, man!\u201d Rickter was dubious. \u201cWe\u2019re trapped here. Right now those\ndevils are watching us. We can\u2019t even talk, but that they know about\nit. Sometimes even before we say anything. I swear they can read our\nthoughts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not quite as bad as that. How about getting some of our old gang\ntogether for a game of cards?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as you say, Rod. But it won\u2019t do any good to talk business.\u201d\n\nRod grinned. \u201cRemember the game we all played when we were kids?\u201d He\nemphasized his remark with a quick gesture.\n\nRickter\u2019s answering grin was sufficient response. \u201cI remember,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a grey-eyed girl around here. Name\u2019s Mona.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Mona Darlanan. She\u2019s hipped on getting that adopted brother of\nhers out of the mines. The Lord knows why! He\u2019s a cowardly little\nwretch.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter keep her from kibitzing if you can. She might have played the\nsame game ... and I don\u2019t think she can be trusted.\u201d\n\nThe first hand had hardly been dealt when Rod threw his cards down and\ncalled for a new deck. He emphasized his dissatisfaction by shaking his\nhand with index finger outstretched, middle finger and thumb conjoined.\nThen he clenched his fist and shook it at the intent players first\nwith the thumb down and then with the thumb up. His fingers stretched\nheaven-ward, except for the index finger when he swore the deck they\nwere using was too dirty.\n\nDon Rickter looked up in mock disgust. The icy glint in his eyes\ndeepened. Rod centered his displeasure on him. After a slight pause,\nRickter argued back. His own gestures were just as aggressive. Soon all\nof them joined in. The chatter continued, hand after hand, but the real\ndiscussion remained in the deaf and dumb sign language--the game all of\nthem had played on Earth before Earth succumbed to the tetrarchs.\n\n\u201cI let myself get caught,\u201d Rod commenced, \u201cbecause of a note smuggled\nthrough to me on a tetrarchian space ship.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds like a trap.\u201d Rickter was succinct. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get a message\nout from here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it came from here.\u201d Rod was equally terse. \u201cI think it\ncame from the survivors of the Hunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Rickter almost forgot to use his hands. \u201cThere can\u2019t be any\nsurvivors.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there are,\u201d Rod insisted. \u201cThey\u2019ve learned how to live on Tetrarch\nIV even when the oxygen in their space suits is exhausted.\u201d\n\nAt this point a rustling was heard among the gathering kibitzers. The\ncrowd was drawing back in sullen anger while a tall, black-robed,\ncadaverous personage forced his way through.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Latham Koler,\u201d he announced, \u201cI understand Rod Harrow is here.\u201d\n\nRod pushed his chair back. Silence settled over the crowd. It was\nbroken suddenly by a scuffle in the far corner of the compartment. A\ngolden-haired girl struggled in the arms of a slave who tried vainly to\nclamp his hand over her mouth.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s here all right.\u201d Mona Darlanan\u2019s disheveled hair fell over her\nshoulders. She pushed the slave from her and struck him sharply. Her\nclear voice shattered the quiet.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s here. And he\u2019s plotting rebellion. I just realized they\u2019ve been\ntalking to each other in sign language!\u201d\n\n\n\nThe walls of the slave compartment seemed to glow with thousands of\nalmost microscopic specks of violet light. A scant moment later the\ndoor to the compartment burst open and the guards entered. They marched\nwith beautiful precision, calmly, impassively.\n\nRod watched them as he rose from his chair. He took quick note of the\nmasks they wore to protect themselves from the air and then he launched\nhimself head first.\n\nHis skull landed with a satisfying plunk in the middle of the first\nguard\u2019s stomach. His reaching arms clasped the tetrarchian\u2019s legs just\nbelow the knees and the tetrarchian landed on the floor--hard. He\nslipped the guard\u2019s blaster from its holster on the way down, knocked\nthe tetrarchian mask loose and rolled to meet the next attacker. His\nturn was just in time to miss a pair of boots--lead-heeled--that were\njamming down on his head. As he twisted, Rod saw another boot. It was\ncoming toward him in the full arc of a fast kick. Rod caught it and\ntwisted. He was slightly surprised when the ankle turned a full three\nhundred and sixty degrees. The guard fell heavily.\n\nHe\u2019d gotten to his feet, blaster in hand, when they rushed him. With\na savage grin, Rod let go. It was good to put electronic slugs in the\nadvancing guards. A small return payment for the slave who had glowed\nto his death! Rod wasn\u2019t sure but what his eyes were playing him\ntricks. He swore the guard was still coming at him. The one with the\nhole in him! Only the unmasked tetrarch was inert on the floor.\n\nHe aimed carefully and let go again. The guard was still coming. The\nlights went out entirely. Rod blasted four times in quick succession,\nthen jumped and twisted sidewise to the floor. As a feint it did him\nlittle good. The guards were up, on him--including the one with five\nholes in his carcass. Rod was held in a vise-like grip while they\nkicked the blaster out of his hand and zipped a space suit over his\nframe.\n\nAs he was hustled out of the compartment he heard Rickter\u2019s voice. \u201cI\u2019m\nsorry, Rod. But I guess it\u2019s useless--and I couldn\u2019t have helped you.\nI\u2019ll be twenty-five next month!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be twenty-five myself,\u201d Rod yelled back. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a swell\nbirthday party.\u201d\n\nThe last sound he heard was Mona\u2019s hysterical laughter.\n\nThe heavy door closed softly and Rod found himself in the stinging sand\nof outside Tetrarch. But only for a moment. The guards took off their\nmasks with obvious relief and guided him to a small building some\nfifty yards from the slave compartment.\n\nHe was thrust through a circular aperture and turned to see himself\nviewed by an elderly tetrarch. It spoke with the peculiar sibilance\nwith which the tetrarchians handled human speech.\n\n\u201cYou are a rassh yonge manss, Ross Harros. Howefser, there iss\nssomething I musst ssay to you. With no one elsse of my rasce pressent.\u201d\n\nA door back of the tetrarch opened silently. Latham Koler slid\nnoiselessly through the opening. Rod scowled into the quisling\u2019s\npeering owl-eyes. It was an effort to resist the impulse to cover both\nof them with a left jab before crossing his right on the bony chin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry our helmets keep me from spitting in your face,\u201d he remarked.\n\nThe tetrarch motioned Koler forward.\n\n\u201cYou are not as mature as I expected.\u201d Koler\u2019s voice rustled like his\ndark garments, \u201cAnd your wits need more exercise. You\u2019d be quarry for\nthe Hunt at this moment, if I hadn\u2019t interceded on your behalf.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuarry?\u201d Rod\u2019s eyebrows raised.\n\n\u201cYes. Every so often one of the hot-heads decides to escape. The\ntetrarchs love it. Sometimes, they deliberately give them the chance.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe pointed to the oxygen cannisters attached to the back of Rod\u2019s space\nsuit. \u201cThe cylinders in our human space suits supply enough air to last\nfor eight hours. When the air is exhausted it seems to be a natural\nreaction to rip the suit open.\n\n\u201cImagine breathing this stuff!\u201d Koler grasped a handful of the sand\nswirling about them. \u201cThat\u2019s the climax of the Hunt. We--uh--they allow\nabout an hour\u2019s head start and then stalk the quarry. The idea is to\ncatch him just as he rips his suit. And to get him to the operating\nchamber just before he dies.\n\n\u201cThe tetrarchs are brilliant technicians, even if they are weak on\ntheory. So I\u2019ve helped them. We are anxious to find out why humans\nexposed to gryxon die on their twenty-fifth birthday. They think\nresearch on still-living humans will give them the answer.\u201d\n\nThe tetrarch waved an arm. \u201cHe is a good sscientisst,\u201d he commented.\n\nKoler\u2019s rustling voice paused while the owl-eyes continued to peer.\n\u201cBut that\u2019s of minor interest. I\u2019ve persuaded them to save you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have influence.\u201d Latham Koler\u2019s voice rustled while the tetrarch\nnodded approvingly. \u201cWe are well aware you were President of the Terran\nScience Association. And that you served in the terran army with\ndistinction in the fruitless fight against the tetrarchs. And we know\nthat you have thousands of devoted followers.\u201d\n\nKoler paused. He peered with bloodshot eyes to see if his remarks were\ntaking effect. \u201cThe tetrarchs are anxious to expand their conquests.\nThey need those that are spending their time guarding the humans now.\nIf you will throw in with us--the rest will follow....\u201d\n\n\u201cAs slaves! With time hanging a glowing torch over our heads! Try\nanother tack, Koler.\u201d\n\nThe bitter anguish in Rod\u2019s voice tightened the skin on the traitor\u2019s\ncadaverous skull. Unconsciously, he stepped back before Rod\u2019s\noverwhelming fury.\n\n\u201cSome day we\u2019ll rid ourselves of the tetrarchs. The time will come when\nEarth again will be free. When it comes, Koler, kill yourself. At least\nyou\u2019ll have your choice of the various kinds of death.\u201d\n\nKoler peered doubtfully at the tetrarch who nodded and walked to the\naperture. A guard stood at attention.\n\n\u201cBring the sslave, Mona Darlanan,\u201d the tetrarch commanded.\n\nWhen she entered Rod faced her impassively. \u201cYou\u2019ve turned traitor too,\nI see.\u201d\n\nThe girl faced him. She looked remote and submissive, but somehow\nuntouched. Her hand sought unconsciously to brush back the heavy golden\nhair under the confines of her helmet.\n\n\u201cI have a brother,\u201d she said simply, \u201cthe baby of our family. We\u2019re all\nthat\u2019s left. My parents adopted him to look after him. I\u2019ve taken over.\u201d\n\n\u201cSslave Darlanan,\u201d the tetrarch interrupted, \u201cwe wissh you to convinsce\nRoss Harros of the sstupidity of further resisstansce.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you do,\u201d Koler\u2019s voice rustled, \u201cperhaps Jerry--your brother--can\nbe put to work in the compartment instead of the mines.\u201d\n\nMona turned her breath-taking beauty on Rod. Her eyes glowed with\npassionate conviction. \u201cDon\u2019t you see,\u201d she said softly, \u201cwe only make\nthings worse by resisting? The tetrarchs want more slaves. Let them get\nthem--from other planets--other galaxies. If we help them perhaps they\nwill send us back to Earth. You\u2019ve _got_ to understand.\u201d\n\n\n\nBefore her his reason was powerless. Unconsciously, his arms encircled\nher waist. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to fight her.\n\nShe dropped her head on his chest. Then she raised her eyes, \u201cYou will\nhelp--with you and Latham Koler in the confidence of the tetrarchs....\u201d\n\nThe spell was destroyed. Rod stiffened. \u201cNot Koler!\u201d He grasped her by\nthe wrists and thrust her away. \u201cKoler!\u201d His voice deepened in contempt.\n\n\u201cWe knew him on Earth before these slave-makers lulled us into a false\nsense of security with their friendship and their gadgets. Koler never\namounted to anything then. He was always on the fringe of things. Here,\nhe\u2019s venting his spite on the few of us that are left--and he\u2019s gotten\nthat opportunity by toadying to these lousy, so-called powers.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo sso fasst,\u201d the tetrarch put out a restraining arm. \u201cWe are simply\nfollowing the desstiny by ensslaving you. Our rasce iss to be the\noverlords of all the galassies. You can have a sshare if you wissh.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can see your point though,\u201d Rod ignored the tetrarch to face Mona,\n\u201cbut don\u2019t you see there are some things more important than your\nbrother--that in spite of him--you can\u2019t turn traitor?\n\n\u201cDo you remember, Mona, how the tetrarchs first came to Earth--how\nfriendly they were and how they loaded us with those amazing\nlabor-eliminating gadgets? Press a button and everything was\ndone--power for our gyros, heat for our buildings, force for our\nmachines--anything and everything. With all our work eliminated we lost\nour watchfulness. They never let us know what powered the gadgets--we\nnever knew about gryxon power until the tetrarchs took over.\n\n\u201cWe found out about gryxon then--in the mines. Once it\u2019s sheathed by\nradium and the radium sheathed with lead--it\u2019s harmless. But--when\nhuman life is used to handle the raw ore--!\u201d\n\nThe vibrant timbre of Rod\u2019s voice seemed to die away to death\u2019s\nwhisper, \u201cWell, we all expect to die when we\u2019re twenty-five ... and\ntime\u2019s passing. Try weighing what you might loosely call the human race\nagainst one brother!\n\n\u201cAnd as for you--\u201d Rod stepped forward quickly and slammed his fist\nagainst the air tank attached to Koler\u2019s space suit. He wrenched it\nloose and threw it away. Not waiting to see the result, he stepped out\nof the aperture and gave the guard the same treatment.\n\nHe raced through the city, wondering why he was not pursued. Then it\ncame to him. There would be a Hunt.\n\nAs he ran across rocky ground he wondered how Koler was taking to a\nsilica diet.\n\nHis course was hazily sketched in his mind. The smuggled note that had\nstarted him from Earth had not been too specific. It couldn\u2019t have\nbeen. There was too much chance of its being intercepted. But he had\na good working knowledge of Tetrarch\u2019s surface. The problem was to\nget to the Survivors--those who had somehow escaped the gryxon mines\nand escaped the hunting tetrarchians--and in getting to them he had\nto throw his pursuers off the trail. There was a test in this, he was\nsure. He thought he had certain clues to that.\n\nWhy, for instance, did a tetrarch with a slug in him keep on fighting?\nWhy did the unearthly glow precede the coming of the guards? He felt he\nought to be glad about that eerie flash. It was a warning--something\nlike a rattlesnake\u2019s.\n\nHis course led him to rocky foothills. He had skirted them when another\ngnawing thought came. When did Mona adopt a brother? He\u2019d never known\nof one. He shrugged the thought aside. He was coming to a broad pass.\nHe kept his course straight, for it was still dark. When dawn came he\nwould seek cover--or did darkness mean anything to the tetrarchians? It\nprobably didn\u2019t.\n\nHe covered the pass and worked his way up the far right of three\ntowering mountains. It was cold--colder even than the bitter keenness\nof the level lands. He notched the heating element in his suit to\nthe top position and continued his climb. In the deep darkness that\npreceded dawn he felt his way along the edge of narrow, jagged ravines.\nThe swirling sands made sight impossible. His progress became slower.\n\nHe had reached almost to the top when dawn glimmered over the horizon.\nFar down over the rocky crags intermittent flashes glowed. Rod sat back\non his haunches and watched their approach.\n\nIn the dawn\u2019s half-light the glowing lights dimmed but he was able to\nmark their progress. Assuming their current speed and allowing for\nlost trails and going off course, they would overtake him in about two\nhours--if he continued at his past speed. They had established a nice\ncalculation--precisely balanced to catch him at the moment his air\nsupply hit zero.\n\nHe would soon be fair bait for the operating room.\n\nHe watched the flaring lights more intently. As they swarmed over the\nfoothills they seemed to lose some of their capacity for glimmering.\nRod nodded comprehension and turned to clamber up the almost vertical\nslope.\n\nIt was hard going and he was in plain view by the time he reached the\ntop. Up here the shifting sand was finer. There was less of it, and it\nhugged the ground more closely than in the lowlands.\n\nAnother hour passed before the flames sensed him. They were working\ntoward him but more slowly. They had lost all semblance of glimmer and\nhad taken on the aspects of a solid sheet, of flame. Rod glanced back\nand noted there was no sign of any figures following the flashes. He\nnodded decisively.\n\nThe facts had fallen into a definite pattern!\n\n\n\nBefore him stretched a plateau, rock-strewn and sand-swept. Beyond it,\nthe topmost peak of the range towered to challenge the pale tetrarchian\nsun. Rod checked his air supply. There was just enough to get him\nacross the plateau.\n\nHe examined the heating element in his suit more carefully and probed\nan exploratory finger across the pocket over his short ribs. The\npackage was still there. The gash under his arm was bothering him\nagain. Well and good! Maybe there would be a chance for it to heal\nproperly if he ever won through.\n\nHe started across the plateau at a fast trot.\n\nHe glanced back at first. But after an hour\u2019s steady progress there was\nno need to. He knew the flames were gaining on him. His breathing was\nthick and labored. The air gauge in his suit was oscillating at zero.\nAs he slowed the pursuing flames speeded forward. One shot ahead of the\nrest and circled over him like a gleam-buzzard. It watched him stagger\nwhile it poised motionless. Then it swooped.\n\nIt darted toward him. He paused and swung an almost drunken punch at\nit. His fist went through it and he recoiled, stricken at the terrific\nshock that traveled along his arm. The flame retreated sullenly to\ncontinue circling.\n\nHe drew a deep breath and held it. The peak wavered before him. It was\nclose now. His head throbbed and the gash in his arm had opened. Warm\nblood was seeping through his sleeve. His leaden feet refused to go\nfurther. He fell to his knees and crawled toward the base of the peak.\nSobbing, each breath a burning hell, he worked his way over the last\nfew yards. He reached the rocky slope and scrambled up crabwise until\nhe collapsed.\n\nThe hovering flames paused. They reached glowing tentacles toward him\nwhile he ripped frantically at his cloying, confining space suit.\n\nHe rolled over on his back when the fastenings gave way. The flames\nhuddled closer in the intense cold of the upper slope when Rod shorted\nthe heating element. It glowed white while he ripped his pocket in a\ndesperate search for red dust--red oxide from the gryxon mines.\n\nHis face was blue when he dropped the dust on the white hot heat coil.\nThe red dust changed to gleaming droplets of mercury. Oxygen--rich pure\noxygen was released in the change. He breathed the life-giving fumes\nthrough pinched nostrils.\n\nWhen strength came pouring back into his air-starved system he advanced\non the weakened flames. They hugged the rocks--inert in the savage\ncold of the mountain. Some of them had changed to glowing liquid.\nOne, higher on the slope than the rest, had frozen to an opalescent\nsolid. When the newly generated oxygen flowed over them they exploded\nharmlessly to grey powder. As the last one disappeared Rod turned to\nface a grinning, space-clad figure.\n\n\u201cNice work, Rod,\u201d the figure called, \u201cI see you answer your mail.\u201d\n\n\u201cBill Williamson!\u201d Rod grinned his relief. \u201cOblige me, pal, by not\nwriting any more notes.\u201d\n\nWilliamson was beside him. He slipped a fresh cannister of air into\nplace on Rod\u2019s space suit and supported him while they clambered\nfurther up the mountain-side.\n\n\u201cThat oxygen trick!\u201d he exulted. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice wrinkle! They sounded\nlike popcorn going off.\u201d\n\nWilliamson led him to a cave entrance buried deep in a gorge. The\nconcealed opening was covered with a heavy wind-proofed canvas. They\nentered through the double fold.\n\n\u201cOxygen equipped!\u201d Rod stared his surprise.\n\n\u201cWe have our creature comforts.\u201d Williamson unlatched his helmet.\n\u201cCrude but effective. We\u2019ve been heating mercury oxide. There\u2019s lots of\nit around. Set awhile--while I call the gang. They\u2019ll be glad to see\nyou.\u201d\n\nWhen the handshaking was over, Rod faced the hardbitten, sand-burned\nSurvivors. These were the men who, like himself, had come through the\ntesting. They had found the way to live on this planet--in the teeth\nof the conquerors of Earth. Now they needed him--needed his genius\nto guide them along the path to freedom--to conquest over the hated\ntetrarchs.\n\n\n\nRod looked at the intent faces about him. \u201cFirst,\u201d he said, \u201cI want the\nanswers to some questions. I\u2019ve figured part of it out myself--check me\nif I go wrong.\n\n\u201cThe Tetrarchs are not human in shape. They\u2019re really flame-like\ngobs of energy--probably phosphoric in nature. For some reason, they\nfashioned plastic bodies which resembled human figures. They have\nalways used these bodies in their dealings with humans--unless they\u2019re\nhunting.\u201d\n\nWilliamson nodded approvingly. \u201cWe stole a few of those imitation\nbodies. They\u2019re all pretty much the same, except for the masks.\nThe ones they use on Earth are built in. Here in Tetrarch they\u2019re\nremovable. They fashioned them to conceal their real structure after\nthey investigated Earth. We humans never knew of them until they made\ntheir appearance in camouflage. They studied us first, devised the body\nand then established relations.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d a Survivor interrupted, \u201cWhen they took us in, they took us\nover--but good! They couldn\u2019t have done it any other way--with their\none lousy town on a two-bit planet.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder normal temperature conditions,\u201d Rod continued, \u201cthey\u2019re gaseous.\nAs it gets colder they become less active and then they turn to liquid.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, chief, and when it gets really cold,\u201d another Survivor\nadded, \u201cthey turn to solid. When we win this fight I\u2019m going to get me\na tetrarch, freeze it, and use it for a light in my fishing lodge.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, you\u2019re not,\u201d a barrel-chested earthman, incongruously named\nBunny, informed him, \u201cyou\u2019re going to contribute it to help spell Mona\nDarlanan\u2019s name in lights on Broadway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019 that again?\u201d Rod\u2019s tone had sharpened.\n\n\u201cMona Darlanan, boss. She\u2019s the greatest actress of them all--bar\nnone.\u201d Bunny grinned disarmingly. \u201cBet you didn\u2019t know you was her\nmessenger boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Rod.\u201d Bill Williamson picked up Rod\u2019s discarded space\nsuit. \u201cHere,\u201d he suppressed a smile with difficulty, \u201cshe\u2019s put a note\non your helmet latching. It\u2019s in code and says she expects to get\ncalled in to start you on your way.\u201d\n\nThere was no stopping Williamson\u2019s laughter, \u201cLook! It says here she\u2019s\nknown you a long time and you\u2019re an old sober-sides. She expects to hug\nyou before you start out and she hopes you\u2019ll like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNice goin\u2019, chief. She didn\u2019t hug me.\u201d Bunny was glum on this point.\n\n\u201cWait a minute, guys.\u201d Rod silenced the laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re all wrong.\nThat girl betrayed me--she\u2019s gone over to the tetrarchs--lock, stock\nand barrel.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hear about it, Rod.\u201d Williamson was intent.\n\nRod recounted briefly what had happened when Mona Darlanan had read his\nsign language.\n\nWhen he was through, Bill Williamson was silent for a long moment. Then\nhe spoke slowly, \u201cRod, you\u2019re the only one who ever arrived on Tetrarch\nknowing of our existence. As a matter of fact, Mona was responsible\nfor smuggling that note aboard the space ship--the one that brought\nyou here. You came close to giving the whole show away with your sign\nlanguage gag. Mona Darlanan was smart enough to realize that and she\ntook the one sure way to get you on your way to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t catch.\u201d Rod Harrow\u2019s face was a study in bewilderment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised.\u201d Williamson was half smiling. \u201cMona does that to\nguys. We first got in touch with her when one of the boys--he\u2019s gone\nthe glowing way now--used one of our captured humanoid suits and made\nlike a guard. We selected Mona as our contact because she\u2019s completely\nand utterly loyal. And she\u2019s probably the finest actress there is.\n\n\u201cTo get herself solid with the tetrarchs she \u2018adopted\u2019 that little\njerk, Jerry Wilson. That was to convince them that she was sincere.\u201d\n\nRod, listening intently, nodded--he understood the why of that gnawing\nthought back on the lowlands now.\n\n\u201cShe keeps us informed of what the tetrarchs are planning--and she\u2019s\ngot them hoodwinked--particularly that rat, Latham Koler.\n\n\u201cGuys are always trying to escape from the mines. Sometimes they\nsurvive. When they do there\u2019s always some message from her. When they\ngo she tells them how to get to us. But they have to promise to destroy\nthe note if it looks as though they won\u2019t get through.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t say anything like that to me,\u201d Rod flared.\n\n\u201cShe had faith in you,\u201d Williamson said shortly, \u201cbesides she knew you\nknew.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you say so, Bill. I admit I missed the boat.\u201d Rod\u2019s thoughts were\nveering crazily.\n\n\u201cBut to get back to business, Rod,\u201d Bill Williamson said, \u201cI don\u2019t know\nhow long we\u2019re going to be safe here. Our one lucky string is the\ntetrarch\u2019s principle of the Hunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was going to ask you about that.\u201d Rod was now alert. \u201cWhy don\u2019t the\ntetrarchs account for every human that escaped?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, boss,\u201d the barrel-chested Bunny spoke, \u201cthey figure, how\ncan they lose? All of us are due for the torch parade once we hit\ntwenty-five.\u201d\n\n\u201cFurther,\u201d Williamson added, \u201cfrom the info I\u2019ve gotten from Mona,\nthe tetrarchs use the Hunt to test themselves. For each quarry caught\nwithout aid of any kind a tetrarchian guard gets promoted. If the\nguard himself is overcome--on his home field--so to speak--the idea\nis they\u2019re well rid of him. That means a constant process of self\nselection.... And it leaves us facing highly dangerous adversaries.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe canvas covering the cave entrance rippled and a Survivor entered.\n\u201cLook alive, pals,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s another guy looks like he\u2019s going\nto get through to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cHope he makes it,\u201d the barrel-chested Bunny rose. \u201cIt\u2019s my turn to put\nout the welcome mat.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does he plan to do?\u201d Rod turned to Bill Williamson.\n\n\u201c\u2019Bout the same thing I did for you. If the fellow gets far enough\nalong, the tetrarchs will retreat, or freeze, and the big fellow will\nbring him in.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we help the guy?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean? What can we do?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said we had plenty of oxygen, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. We got it stored in tanks we stole from the tetrarchs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, c\u2019mon, Bill. Let\u2019s explode a few or four.\u201d\n\n\u201cLor Lumme! Tetrarch popcorn! What all will we need, Rod?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout eight men. Two teams--two each--for diversion. And four men for\nthe push. We\u2019ll try it small scale for size.\u201d\n\nThe oxygen tanks were quickly distributed. Rod gave eight Survivors\nrapid instructions. \u201cI\u2019ll give you ten minutes to get in position,\u201d he\nfinished, \u201cWilliamson and I will watch from the top heights.\u201d\n\nBy the time Rod and Williamson had taken their position high\non the mountain-side the staggering human had won to within a\nhundred yards of the final slope. The flames were circling--darting\nforward--retreating--only to renew the attack. They were so intent on\ntheir prey they missed the helpless second figure--until he set up a\nhoarse scream for help.\n\nWhen the flames realized there was a second quarry they hesitated--but\nnot for long. If anything, the second man was farther gone than the one\nwho was now scrambling up the slope.\n\nThe new quarry was bent over a cylinder of some sort. His legs kicked\nfeebly. His arms were jerking spasmodically as he tried to tear his\nsuit fastenings.\n\nAlmost half the flames raced to him. Tentacles outstretched, they\nswooped--into the oblivion of hissing oxygen. A few tried to escape.\nAnother human stepped from behind a concealing boulder. Rod watched him\nplay an oxygen stream over them like a pest-sprayer.\n\nThe flames which had remained behind reacted instinctively. They\nretreated. Their vanguard exploded before two more humans who rose from\nthe sand-misted shadows of a narrow gorge in the plateau.\n\nThey broke then. They fled in wild disorder in the only direction open.\nNow, four men rose from concealed positions to bar their way.\n\nThe annihilation was complete!\n\nOn the heights above, Williamson was dancing a war jig. \u201cWe wowed \u2019em,\nRod,\u201d he screeched. \u201cWe wowed \u2019em. Look at that grey powder! Look at\nit! Them\u2019s dead tetrarchs, me boy.\u201d\n\nHe pounded Rod on the back in complete forgetfulness of the glowing\ndoom. \u201cWhen we get back to earth I\u2019m gonna marry me a nice girl. And\nI\u2019m gonna throw pop corn parties every night in the week. And I\u2019m gonna\ninvite all the neighbors. And when the kernels go \u2018Pop\u2019 I\u2019m gonna say,\n\u2018That\u2019s what we did to the tetrarchs.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe was still pounding Rod\u2019s back when Bunny came puffing up. \u201cYou\u2019d\nbetter come in a hurry, boss,\u201d he said, \u201cthat guy down there wants to\ntalk to you and he ain\u2019t got much time left.\u201d\n\nRod frowned. \u201cLets go,\u201d he said briefly.\n\nHe ran down the slope to the inert figure that lay like a blade of mown\ngrass at the base.\n\nWhen the others arrived he was kneeling by the fallen slave, supporting\nhim by the head and shoulders. There was no mistaking the ghastly\npallor spreading over the waxen face.\n\nHis breathing was jerky--almost spasmodic as he whispered, \u201cAnd then\nthey worked on Rickter. They had grown suspicious when things started\nto disappear ... when more slaves escaped and never got caught.\u201d\n\nHis breathing paused. The skin on the man\u2019s forehead lost its waxy\npallor. It became dry--harsh--yellow-tinged.\n\nRod braced him more firmly--the tortured chest heaved again. \u201cWhen they\nfound out ... about the Survivors ... they decided to finish us. They\nhad been working to find out about a cure for the gryxon burn. Koler\nworked with them and discovered how to make it work faster ... said it\nwas a catalyst ... forced us to eat it ... one by one.\u201d\n\n\u201cMona?\u201d Rod asked gently.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve saved her and a few more ... going to experiment ...\noperate ... say humans no use as slaves ... too stiff-necked ... make\nbetter guinea pigs ... we\u2019re finished.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe slave tried to speak again. But his chest was rigid, fixed. His\neyes filmed. He ceased the struggle.\n\nRod laid him down, still gently and straightened him, crossing his\nhands over his chest. Smoke came in a fine haze from the flaring\nnostrils. Bloody froth flew from between the drawn lips. The Satanic\ngrin came with the onslaught of the greenish glow.\n\nAnd then--there were ashes!\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready, boss.\u201d Bunny\u2019s voice was quiet.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Williamson\u2019s voice was equally low, \u201cwe\u2019ve got time until we\u2019re\ntwenty-five--to exterminate every tetrarch on the planet. The best we\ncan hope for is a dead draw. Shall we get started, Rod? There\u2019s little\ntime left to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have the advantage of surprise,\u201d Rod agreed, \u201cunless we walk\ninto a trap. But I think we can outmaneuver them.\u201d\n\nHe turned quickly. \u201cAnyone here within a week of their twenty-fifth\nbirthday?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so, Rod.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyone within a month of their twenty-fifth birthday who is also from\nthe Mediterranean section of Earth?\u201d\n\nHe paused. Their silence gave him his answer.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he said, \u201cin this game we\u2019ve still got our hole card.\n\n\u201cNow, remember this one thing. Our objective is the science\nbuilding--they operate there--and that\u2019s where they\u2019ll store the\ncatalyst. Anything else is secondary.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll try a feint on the slave compartment. We\u2019ll drive in force on\nall communication centers. I\u2019ll make maps showing their locations--I\nmade it my job to get that info before I left Earth. And we\u2019ve got\nto kill every tetrarchian space ship crew either at the same time or\nimmediately after we destroy communications. We\u2019ve none too much oxygen\nfor a job of this size. That\u2019s our main weapon. So make it count. We\u2019ll\nuse what blasters we have. And if you run into any tetrarchians with\nspace suits on aim for the mask. That\u2019s all you need to do before you\ngive him the explosion treatment. Is everything clear?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll we need is to know who\u2019s going to lead who to where,\u201d Bunny said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have plans drawn up at headquarters in half an hour,\u201d Rod\npromised. \u201cMeantime leave a twenty-percent reserve of oxygen here and\nbreak the rest down from tanks to all the cannisters you can get your\nhands on.\u201d\n\nRod walked rapidly up the hill outlining details of the battle plan to\nWilliamson as they entered the cave.\n\nThe slave compartment feint-party left first. Communications-destroyers\nleft in four groups. Space-hangar attack-parties followed. Under\nBunny\u2019s direction, they had managed to rig up a fairly creditable\ncamouflage.\n\nThere was an argument about command of the main force against the\nscience building. Rod had assumed it without second thought. Williamson\nwas obdurate.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care who handles it, Rod,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you can\u2019t. If\nanything goes wrong there\u2019ll be no one left to carry the fight. You\u2019ve\ngot to stay here until we control the lowlands.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be twenty-five next month,\u201d Rod said briefly. \u201cSo it can\u2019t matter\nmuch one way or the other.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, Rod. I forgot about that. I\u2019ve only six weeks to go myself. One\nof the youngsters will have to take over the reserve.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you and I will take a whack at this together.\u201d\n\nWilliamson draped two cannisters of oxygen about his waist. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d\nhe said.\n\nTheir pace down the mountain was swift but unhurried. On the plateau\nWilliamson scuffled tetrarchian ashes whenever he found them. They were\nfast disappearing in the swirling sand.\n\nThey scattered their force when they left the foothills. There was an\noccasional tetrarch flame to draw the men\u2019s fire.\n\n\n\nThey encountered their first resistance within blaster range of the\nmines. From the roof of the slave compartment purple blaster arcs\nrained down. The fire was scattered at first but it increased in volume\nwhen the main body of the Survivors surged into view.\n\nThe tetrarchs were no mean marksmen. The stench of burning, smoking\nflesh tainted the atmosphere.\n\nAs the men broke for cover Rod demonstrated counter measures. He\ntook position behind a corner wall and fired three times. Each shot\npunctured a tetrarchian mask. When the enemy huddled to replace them he\nlobbed an oxygen cannister over the roof and blasted it as it poised\nat the height of its arc. The hissing gas struck quickly. He saw one\nof the unprotected tetrarchs collapse. Its imitation body toppled over\nthe parapet to the ground. A Survivor wiggled toward it and snatched\na blaster from its limp hand. He accounted for three more on the roof\nbefore they killed him.\n\nHis sacrifice gave his fellows an opportunity. While he had engaged the\ntetrarchs two Survivors wedged themselves in the corner of a supporting\nabutment. One had clambered on the other\u2019s shoulders. The men scrambled\nup this living ladder and over the parapet.\n\nIn the midst of a wild melee support came--through the roof. The\nfeinting force that had attacked earlier had taken the interior of\nthe slave compartment. They cut through the roof when they heard\nthe scuffling. Oxygen roared through the opening into Tetrarch\u2019s\ndead atmosphere. The struggle was brief--and without quarter to the\ntetrarchs.\n\nRod, meanwhile, had reorganized his forces and directed them to proceed\nto the science building and surround it.\n\nHis Survivors were better equipped now. They had gained blasters.\nThe feint on the slave compartment had won them the oxygen-making\nequipment. It had diverted the enemy from Rod\u2019s main objective. And the\nmen of the feint-party now stood ready to reinforce him.\n\nA courier dashed to him. Bunny was reporting that all space ship\nhangars had been immobilized. He had then turned to assist in the\ncommunications clean up. He wanted further orders.\n\nThe orders were brief: to explode all tetrarchians encountered while\nproceeding to the science building.\n\nHis own men waited in silence. They waited before a quiet, ominous\nbuilding. It stood--a squat, sullen pile--a citadel of science\nperverted--of infamous torture.\n\nAnd from it--through a door quickly opened and as quickly shut--a human\nemerged. A human who limped and snuffled as he crossed the clearing\ntoward the Survivors.\n\n\u201cHarrow,\u201d he called, \u201cI\u2019m an emissary to Rod Harrow. I want to speak to\nRod Harrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right. What is it?\u201d Rod strode forward despite Williamson\u2019s\nrestraining hand.\n\nThe whimpering slave gathered himself together and spoke as if he had\nmemorized his piece.\n\n\u201cThe tetrarchs say if you\u2019ll surrender yourself they\u2019ll spare the rest\nof the humans.\u201d\n\n\u201cBluff! A miserable bluff!\u201d Williamson had come forward blazing with\nindignation. His contempt at the servile gestures of the slave was\nmounting. \u201cWe\u2019ll kill every tetrarch on the planet--and you with them,\nif you\u2019re not careful. You can sniffle on back there and tell them that\ntheir position is hopeless.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t you see,\u201d the coward was almost in tears, \u201cthey\u2019ve got the\ncatalyst.\u201d The tears, no longer denied, streaked down his face. \u201cAt\nfirst it would work in eight hours no matter what our age. Now, Latham\nKoler\u2019s got it so it can work in five min--O-oh! I\u2019ve been hit!\u201d\n\nRod caught a quick glimpse of Latham Koler\u2019s saturnine grin. He had\nappeared at the building opening for a moment and fired.\n\nRod couldn\u2019t see the weapon he had used but its results were plain. A\ntiny dart had pierced the coward\u2019s helmet. It protruded from the back\nof his neck.\n\nWilliamson plucked the dart and held it in his hand. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look\ndangerous,\u201d he said. But Jerry had collapsed.\n\nRod pointed to the fallen coward. A familiar pallor was spreading over\nhis features.\n\n\u201cThe glow! Rod! Look at it! It\u2019s working already!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a stepped-up catalyst all right.\u201d Rod was thoughtful. \u201cThat dart\nis really a hypo needle. Lets get to cover and see what we can do about\nit.\u201d\n\nWhen Rod outlined his plan Williamson was adamant. They couldn\u2019t go\nthrough with it. He, Williamson, wasn\u2019t going to permit it. But Rod had\nhis way.\n\nThey picked the best marksmen arbitrarily. There were volunteers in\nplenty to storm the building if the ruse worked.\n\nIt took a little time to stuff their clothes with sand. Williamson\nchecked them personally to make sure that the layer under their clothes\nwas at least three inches thick.\n\nWhen everything was ready Rod strode forward like Achilles taunting the\nTrojans. He exhausted his vocabulary. All the vituperative terms he\ncould remember and a few that came to him extempore were hauled out to\ndescribe the tetrarchs. He told them they would be frozen to provide\nlights for their own mines--that the humans would break them into small\nchunks to make jewels for Earth\u2019s women.\n\nIt worked. It was more than tetrarch nature could take.\n\n\n\nDoors opened for a fleeting second. The vengeful flames showered him\nwith darts.\n\nIn that brief interval they were met with withering blasts from the\nmarksmen. The humans had brought the oxygen machinery up from the slave\ncompartment. It streamed toward the building like water from a pressure\nhose.\n\nAt the same instant the volunteers rushed. For an instant the fight\nteetered in the balance--and then they were in.\n\nRod bristled with sand-blunted darts as he battered his way through the\nhoney-combed building, searching for the operating chamber. He burst\nthrough the entrance--to face Mona Darlanan.\n\nThey hadn\u2019t had time to work on her. But they\u2019d done their best. They\u2019d\ntied her to a vertical platform first.\n\nThe dart in her breast had drawn blood!\n\nLatham Koler squirmed from behind the platform. His cadaverous face was\ntransfixed with the grin of a skeleton skull. He aimed a blaster point\nblank at Rod and fired.\n\nThe streaming arc buried itself harmlessly in the three-inch sand layer\nover Rod\u2019s chest. And he was on Koler like a berserk.\n\nHe broke the traitor\u2019s helmet first. And forced fingers and thumb\naround his windpipe. When the peering eyes protruded and the\nthin-lipped mouth hung agape Rod lifted the dart gently from Mona\nDarlanan\u2019s body.\n\nHe jammed it down Koler\u2019s throat.\n\nWilliamson came pounding in. \u201cWe\u2019ve got them all, Rod. Tetrarch IV is\nin our hands!\u201d\n\nRod was frantically tearing at his sleeve. \u201cGet me a knife,\u201d he\nordered, \u201cquickly.\u201d\n\nHe ripped the sleeve off. As more and more Survivors came piling into\nthe room he ordered liters of distilled water.\n\nMeanwhile he was busily plying the scalpel Williamson brought to him.\nThe gash on his arm had never quite healed was getting probed. Rod dug\nwith the scalpel as though he were going after a bullet.\n\nThe small platinum capsule he forced from the cut in his arm was not\nunlike one.\n\nHe glanced anxiously at Mona\u2019s face. The pallor had gone. A harshening\nof her exquisite skin had taken its place.\n\nThe contents of the capsule dissolved in five liters of water in a\nmatter of seconds. Rod picked an unfilled dart from a litter on a\ntable. He filled it with his newly made solution and injected it in the\ngirl\u2019s arm.\n\nThey waited.\n\n\u201cWill it do any good, Rod?\u201d Williamson was solemn in the quiet room.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. We developed it on Earth in our lab in the Rockies.\nThere was plenty of gryxon in our machines. Volunteers exposed\nthemselves to it. That capsule, Bill, was purchased at the price of\nmartyrdom.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it works, our race is saved.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how they felt about it. We found that raw gryxon was instant\ndeath to humans over twenty-five. Those under twenty-five were immune\nunless they came from stock that matured early--as the Mediterranean\npeoples. They succumbed before twenty-five. That was what really gave\nus our answer. We knew that ankylosis--joining of certain spinal\nvertebrae--occurred earlier in humans that matured earlier--and\nthat age twenty-five was the time for the joinder to occur. So we\nturned to the serums that had increased human life spans by retarding\nankylosis--and developed this one.\u201d\n\nThey studied Mona\u2019s face again.\n\n\n\nWas it possible that the yellow tinge was stayed--was turned to waxen\nivory? The girl\u2019s breast rose and fell--ever so gently.\n\n\u201cI concealed our serum,\u201d Rod went on slowly, \u201cfrom the tetrarchs by\nburying it in my arm. I had to get a hypo needle before I could use it\nhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave I had a fever, Rod?\u201d Mona\u2019s grey eyes were open. \u201cOr is this\ndelirium?\u201d\n\nRod Harrow crossed to her swiftly. He cradled her head in his arms. She\nwas smiling again--relaxed.\n\nThen he turned to Williamson. \u201cLine \u2019em up, Bill. With five liters we\ncan inoculate every human on Tetrarch IV. There\u2019ll never be a gryxon\nglow again.\n\n\u201cAnd as soon as a company has had all men injected, send them to the\ncave to bring back the reserves. We\u2019ll need their help.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo celebrate?\u201d Williamson wanted to know.\n\n\u201cNot particularly.\u201d Rod was impatient. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to do some planet\ncleaning.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlanet cleaning!\u201d\n\n\u201cRight! We\u2019re ready now to wipe the tetrarchs off our Earth.\u201d",
