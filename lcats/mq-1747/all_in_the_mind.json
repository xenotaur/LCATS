But take the strange case of Mel Carlson who\ngave a lot of_ thought _to the matter_.]\n\n\nMel felt as if he were floating on clouds in the deepest, most intense\ndark he had ever experienced. He tried opening his eyes but nothing\nhappened, only a sharp pain. Little bits of memory flashed back and he\ntried to figure out what could have happened, where he was.\n\nThe last thing he could remember was the little lab hidden back in the\nmountains in an old mine tunnel. Remote, but only an hour's drive from\nthe city. What had he been doing? Oh yes, arguing with Neil again. He\neven recalled the exact words.\n\n\"Damn it, Mel,\" his partner had said. \"We've gone about as far as\npossible working with animal brains. We've got to get a human one.\"\n\n\"We can't,\" Mel had disagreed. \"There'd be enough of an uproar if the\npapers got hold of what we've been doing with animals. If we did get\nsomeone in a hospital to agree to let us use his brain on death, they\nwould close us up tighter than a drum.\"\n\n\"But our lab's too well hidden, they'd never know.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't work anyway. The brain might be damaged for lack of oxygen\nand all of our work would go for nothing. Worse, it might indicate\nfailure where a fresh, healthy brain would mean success.\"\n\n\"We'll never know unless we try,\" said Neil almost violently, dark eyes\nglittering. \"Our funds aren't going to last forever.\"\n\nMel had turned his back and was leaning over the tank where the latest\nbrain--that from a dog--was lying immersed in the life-giving liquid, a\nthin flickering line of light on the oscilloscope behind the tank the\nonly indication that the brain was alive.\n\nWhat had happened then? He thought hard, until a sharp pain and growing\nheadache almost made him lose consciousness. Either he'd passed out or\nsomething had happened. Maybe the cave had collapsed the concrete walls\nof their lab, although he didn't see how that could have happened.\n\nHe became aware of voices, faint at first, then growing stronger. He\nstrained to listen and just when it appeared that the words would become\ndistinct enough to understand, they faded away. He waited hopefully\nuntil they came back. This time he could understand words and parts of\nsentences.\n\n\"... connect this first and....\"\n\n\"No, be careful. Too much voltage would ruin everything and we'd have\nto....\"\n\n\"Where does this connection go, here?\"\n\nThe other voice boomed in then, deep vibrations feeling as if they would\nshatter his brain. There was a frantic quality in the words.\n\n\"No, no, you fool, don't....\" A penetrating pain knifed through Mel's\nhead and he tried to scream but heard nothing but a loud buzzing. He\nwelcomed the loss of consciousness as it blanketed him.\n\nHe struggled back to consciousness once more, a voice calling over and\nover in a monotone. \"Mel, Mel Carlson. Can you hear me, Mel? Mel, Mel\nCarlson. Can you hear me, Mel?\" he listened intently, recognizing it as\none of the first voices he had heard. He tried to move but could feel no\nresponse of legs or arms. It was like being buried alive and he tried to\ncall out for help. He must have lost his voice because he could still\nhear the same call.\n\n\"Mel, Mel Carlson, can you....\" It broke off abruptly, then came back\ntriumphantly. \"You do hear me, Mel, I can see.\"\n\nAgain Mel tried to call out, without success. The other warned quickly.\n\"Don't become alarmed. We're still working on your voice. Just try to\nrest.\" Mel suddenly realized that he'd been listening to Neil and a wave\nof thankfulness swept over him. There had been a cave-in then and he'd\nbeen injured. Neil was speaking again, a note of professional regret in\nhis voice.\n\n\"I'm sorry it had to happen this way but there was too much tied up in\nthe project to lose now.\" A growing realization and horror began to seep\nthrough Mel's mind. Neil continued, after a brief pause. \"The sine wave\njumped. I see you must realize now. I had to do it, Mel. After all, you\naren't dead you know, just your body is gone. Your brain may live for\nhundreds of years. Why just think, you'll be able....\" Oblivion again\nclaimed Mel.\n\n\n\nOnce more Mel was floating on clouds and this time the sensation was\nexhilarating. He tried moving his arms and legs to see if he could swim\nthrough the velvety darkness but failed. A faint glow began to appear\nahead of him and a low rumble of voices began to echo throughout his\nmind. Full realization of what had happened swept over him and he\nstruggled to retain his sanity. The voices were louder and he recognized\nthat of Neil, who was saying,\n\n\"... is conscious now. Easy on the voltage, remember last time.\" A brief\npause, then louder. \"Mel, I see that you hear me. Listen carefully. I've\ntried out several of my own theories, that's why you can hear. And, in\njust a moment, I'm going to give you eyesight. We're having trouble with\na voice.\" The light began growing in intensity and hurt his eyeballs.\nMel remembered then, depressed, that he had no eyes of his own. Even at\nthe thought, he tried to shut his eyes which only caused his brain to\nache more. He tried completely relaxing in an endeavor to capture the\nfloating sensation once more.\n\n\"Ah, that's better,\" approved Neil's voice. \"I see that the brain wave\nhas smoothed down. If you'll just accept what's happened, Mel, we should\nbe able to work together.\" Figures began to form in the white mist. As\nthey became stronger but out of focus, he saw Neil bent over a control\npanel, carefully making adjustments and glancing frequently at the\nleaping line of green light across the scope in front of him. He felt a\nsurge of hate sweep through his brain and saw the green line jump\nviolently. Neil's hand jumped instinctively toward a red-covered switch.\nAt the same time, he flashed a glance towards a tank that was barely\nwithin the range of Mel's vision. He realized almost at once that it\nmust be the same one in which his brain was resting. The full, sickening\nrealization of what had happened hit him and he almost went over the\nblack-out line. Then Neil's face loomed square in his direction and\nhate, the most intense he had ever experienced, brought the green line\nthat represented his brain's output up to full level.\n\nHis brain sent impulses out to the nerve ends that had controlled his\narms and legs. They felt as if they were still attached to him but\nparalyzed. His mind felt clearer and sharper now than it ever had before\nin his life. He determined to analyze his new mental capabilities\ncarefully in the hope he would find a means of striking back.\n\nDuring the next few weeks, only his hatred for Neil enabled Mel to keep\nhis sanity. The first empty feeling that the future could hold nothing\nfor him but horror gave way to planning and scheming. His mechanical\nvoice was perfected, operated by the nerve ends of his brain, much as\nhis original vocal cords had functioned. It enabled him to now assist in\nhis own rehabilitation by suggesting improvements or solutions to\nmechanical aids he could control. The steady growth or realization of\nhis mental powers were amazing to Mel. He realized that they must have\nbeen inherent and in his subconscious all of the time, only his loss of\nbody brought them out now. That, plus the fact that he required\npractically no rest if the stimulants pumped into the tank were\nsufficient.\n\n\n\nThis last was the clue to his use by Neil. It became apparent that his\nerstwhile partner planned on using him to the fullest possible extent.\nFirst Neil brought in a problem concerning a new type of paint to absorb\nthe rays of the sun and convert them into electrical energy. Not until\nhe had studied the problem and given Neil the answer did Mel realize the\nfull financial potentiality of his powers.\n\nHe immediately brought up the subjects. \"What about our partnership\nagreement on profits?\" he asked.\n\n\"Profits?\" repeated Neil with a nasty smile. \"Why? Where did you plan on\ngoing?\"\n\nFor once Mel was glad that his voice was flat and devoid of all\ninflection. It kept the other from sensing the rage that made him want\nto do something violent. \"You know what I mean,\" he insisted doggedly.\n\"Unless you want to admit murder, we're still partners.\"\n\nNeil laughed and said, \"That's right. Of course I can draw any and all\nfunds that I need but if the authorities ever check on your\ndisappearance, they'll find that a separate account has been opened in\nyour name in the City. All you have to do is go in and withdraw it any\ntime you want to.\" He chuckled, then grew serious.\n\n\"Don't get any ideas,\" he warned. \"We've been spending most of the time\nduring the past couple of months getting you in shape for your intended\nfunction and I'm going to bring more and more problems in to you.\" He\nexplained further, \"I've opened an engineering consultant service in the\ncity and this paint formula alone will bring us all the business we'll\nneed.\" He pretended to be busy at one of the computers being installed\nbut Mel could see that he was glancing out of the corners of his eyes at\nthe oscilloscope for indication of a brain reaction. Mel had learned\nseveral weeks ago that he could control the output of his brain and had\nbeen careful to conceal the fact from Neil.\n\nHis partner said, disappointment in his voice. \"Doesn't my attitude\nbother you anymore?\"\n\nMel's mechanical voice rolled out. \"When you destroyed my body, you\ndestroyed all emotions. If that's the way you want to do things, that's\nthe way it'll be.\"\n\n\"But the ethics....\"\n\n\"I know what would happen to me if you turned me over to the scientists.\nI'd be a freak and treated as such. I owe nothing to the world.\"\n\n\"Swell,\" enthused Neil, this time his face twisted into a grimace of\npleasure. \"I've got a lot of plans that you'll fit into.\"\n\nExperiments had been made with muscular control and they discovered that\nMel could govern an electrically powered table, controlled by short wave\nradio. Another \"eye\" that could swing in a 360 degree circle had been\nmounted on it and broadcast its information to Mel's optical circuit. A\nmechanical arm had also been installed on it and Mel spent long night\nhours when the lab was quiet perfecting his control over it. Before\nlong, he was as much--if not more--proficient with it as he had been\nwith his own arms. He began laying his plans.\n\nThe first thing he needed was a weapon. Getting his control cart out of\nthe cubicle was easy since Jenkins, the only assistant allowed in the\nentire laboratory, had left his key ring lying on a table one morning.\nIt had been but the work of a moment to wheel over, pick them up and\nthen conceal them. Jenkins had spent a frantic hour in search but\nfinally went into the machine shop to make up a new set. He had first\ncautioned Mel against letting Neil know, almost fawning in his gratitude\nwhen Mel promised.\n\nHe searched the entire lab the first two nights but discovered that Neil\nhad taken the revolver he had kept in a drawer of his old desk. It would\ntake too long to try and machine another one, although their machine\nshop had proven its capability of turning out anything. A knife he\ndiscarded as too clumsy for his means of control. He then carefully\nconsidered steel darts shot from a tube by compressed air or carbon\ndioxide but reluctantly abandoned that idea also. Since he had a\nmachine's limitations as well as advantages, he'd have to begin thinking\nless like a human. So, the first thing to base a weapon on would be the\nmaterial most plentiful in the lab. That was--electricity.\n\n\n\nOnce determined on the line of his endeavors, he briefly marvelled again\non the still unexplored potentialities of his brain. The weapon would be\nmounted on his own cart and electricity could either be broadcast or\nself-contained. For mobility, he decided on a power pack. The weapon\nitself evolved so easily that he wondered why no one had thought of it\nbefore now. Special type condensers built a battery charge up to over a\nmillion volts for a split second. This charge, invisible until it hit an\nobject more solid than air, was contained in a very narrow beam by\nstrong screens of opposite polarity. The entire sequence of operation\nwas almost instantaneous, and the bolt was more in the nature of an\nelectrical projectile than a continuous beam.\n\nHe decided that the unit, resembling a flashlight, could be mounted in a\nconcealed spot under his \"eye\" so that it could be fired at whatever he\nmight be looking at.\n\nNow that he had a means of defending himself, Mel felt more at ease but\nat a loss for his next step. Merely eliminating both Jenkins and Neil\nwould gain his revenge but what then? He could always notify the\nauthorities but mentally flinched at exposing himself to the world as a\nfreak and being at the mercy of the morbid curiosity of millions.\n\nHe had hardly begun to lay his plans before disaster struck. Neil came\nin early one morning and had Mel begin working on a problem concerning a\nnew type of steel that would combine structural strength with the\nlightweight qualities of aluminum. Mel energized his calculators that\nwere, electrically, practically part of his brain. He briefly wondered\nwhy Neil appeared so restless, wandering around the room with his hands\nbehind his back, studying everything. Then the problem became so\nintriguing that he completely forgot that anyone was in the room.\n\nHis first inkling that anything was wrong was when Neil straightened up\nfrom the cart with a twisted smile on his face and exclaimed:\n\n\"Ha!\"\n\nMel's first, startled conjecture was that the other had discovered the\nspecial weapon. He tried to rotate the lens so that the weapon would\npoint at Neil but could see, by other stationary lenses in the room,\nthat the one on the cart remained motionless. The same was true of the\nmechanical arm. In fact, the entire cart was dead.\n\n\"I pulled the main power fuse,\" said Neil, a slight smile on his face.\n\"I suppose you thought you were getting away with it completely.\" Not\npositive as to how much his partner knew, Mel, decided on silence as his\ndefense. The smile disappeared from the other's face and he continued,\nslowly:\n\n\"Something must be wrong with your reasoning. I knew something was up\nwhen the power company's statement showed an unusually high increase in\npower consumption. From there on it was easy to read the meters at night\nmyself, and then the next morning. What were you up to anyway?\" Mel\nstill maintained his silence.\n\n\"Okay if that's the way you want it,\" said Neil more harshly. He walked\nto the end of the tank and Mel felt his brain telegraphing warnings to\nsevered nerve connections not yet again in use. Neil reached out to a\nvalve Mel recognized as controlling the minute amount of chemicals that\nserved to nourish the cells in his brain. Relays were connected to it\nthat also regulated the injection of oxygen proportionately into the\nfluid. He turned it slightly then began watching the oscilloscope\nclosely. In a matter of seconds, Mel felt his usually sharp senses begin\nto dull. The oscilloscope blurred until, by great effort, he brought it\ninto focus again. He saw that the height of the wavy line denoting the\nstrength of his brain's output was abnormally low.\n\n\"Feeling all right?\" asked Neil in mock anxiety. He turned the valve\nback to its correct setting and almost instantly Mel felt better.\n\"That's just a sample of what can happen if you force me to it,\" warned\nthe other. \"A little more of a turn and that super brain of yours would\nbe garbage. Only I wouldn't do that, of course. There are a few more\nexperiments I want to make before your brain dies.\" Knowing the vicious\nnature of his partner, Mel decided to talk before the other goaded\nhimself into some unplanned action.\n\n\"Don't forget the fable about the goose that laid the golden eggs,\" his\nvoice rolled out. \"There's still a lot I could do for you, you know--or\n_not_ do.\" He saw with relief that the anger receded from the other's\nface to be replaced by a look of cunning.\n\n\"I almost forgot,\" said Neil. \"I've another surprise for you.\" He went\nto a circuit near the master calculator that he himself had installed\nonly several days ago. All the master components were open, a rheostat\nappearing to be the primary control. Mel had decided at the time it had\nto do with voltage regulation of the calculator since there had been\ntrouble with it.\n\nNeil placed his hand on it, then turned his head in the general\ndirection of the tank and said, \"Just in case you get ideas of not\nco-operating, I can use this for persuasion.\" He cracked the vernier\njust a trifle and agony knifed through Mel's brain. It receded, leaving\na slight ache.\n\n\"Not much voltage,\" Neil was saying with satisfaction, \"but, judging\nfrom the way your brain wave jumped, I don't imagine it felt very good,\ndid it?\"\n\n\"You win,\" was Mel's only comment, not wanting another jolt. Never\nbefore had he felt so helpless and completely at the mercy of another.\nHe realized more and more that he had less defense than a new-born baby,\nwhich could at least kick and wave its hands. He could do nothing except\ntry to retain his sanity and wait for his day to come....\n\n\"Good,\" approved his partner, his manner indicating that it was the most\nnatural thing in the world that Mel should give in. \"Just in case you\nforget, I think I'll keep the cart disconnected so that you can't do\nanything to harm yourself at night.\" His manner abruptly turned\nbusiness-like. \"Now then, that paint formula story got around and we've\ngot a lot of business to handle. Most of it's routine for you but we'll\ndrag it out and sock them plenty. A couple of items we'll copy after\nyou've solved them and say it couldn't be done.\"\n\n\n\nMel missed the cart more than he thought he would. It was much like the\ntime when, as a boy, he'd broken a leg and had to stay in bed for\nseveral weeks. He was forced to turn in on himself.\n\nThe real turn in the development of his mind, and above the level he had\nthought possible, came about as an accident one day. Resting, with\nnothing to do, he had the full room in vision with the stationary\nlenses. A flicker of motion caught his attention and careful waiting\ndisclosed it to be a small mouse that had somehow gained access to the\nlaboratory and then into his room. Welcoming any change in his routine,\nhe watched as the small creature scurried around the room looking for\nsomething to eat. Several times Mel amused himself by causing his voice\nbox to rumble, making the rodent scurry around madly for a hiding place\nuntil the imagined danger had passed. Eventually it became used to the\nnoise and not even talking affected it.\n\nIt disappeared from sight for several minutes and Mel had just begun to\nwonder if it had a nest in the equipment when it reappeared on top of\nthe calculator, near the electrical prod that Neil had used on his\nbrain. Remembering the searing jolt it had given him, Mel watched\nanxiously as the mouse pushed an inquisitive nose into the still exposed\ncomponents. He became more concerned as the animal became more\nintrigued. Not only was there danger that the mouse would push down on a\ndelicate relay and close it, but he could conceivably short out the main\npower supply. The result wasn't pleasant to contemplate. If it didn't\npermanently damage some of his brain cells, the pain might drive him\ninto insanity.\n\nHe tried shouting but the mouse paid no attention to him. He called for\nfirst, Jenkins and then Neil until he remembered that his partner had\nsaid they were going in after some special equipment. While he watched\nhelplessly, the mouse stretched out and touched a relay point. Instantly\npain knifed through his brain and he became aware of a roaring sound\nthat he realized was his voice blaring out. The extra loud and continued\nblast of sound had caused the mouse to withdraw nervously from the\nrelay. Something about it had made him determined, however, and as Mel\nwas barely recovering from the first jolt, the mouse moved back. Mel\nwished desperately that the cart had been left in operation so that he\nmight at least use the sound of motion or the mechanical arm to frighten\nhis tiny tormentor from the vicinity of the relay.\n\nHe watched intently as the mouse came closer to the points, oblivious to\neverything else in the room. As it almost touched the points, a violent\nsurge of hate coursed through his brain cells and he was surprised to\nsee the mouse flung violently back down to the floor. It lay there\nmotionless and he finally realized, with thankfulness, that it was dead.\nAs the pain from the jolt subsided to the point where he could barely\nfeel it, he began to wonder what had happened. The amount of voltage\nnecessary to hurt him was so small that nothing beyond a direct short\nacross the primary power would have affected the mouse. He began to\nanalyze everything preceding the point where the mouse had been flung\nfrom the top of the calculator. A check and recheck brought the same\nanswer, one that he had at first refused to believe--his thoughts had\nbeen responsible.\n\nFurther contemplation convinced him that, while his thoughts had\nundoubtedly been responsible, the mental power itself had not been\nenough, as pure, brute force, to accomplish the task, but must have\nstruck at the rodent's brain itself. That would have been enough to\nconvulse the animal's muscles and make it look at first as if some\noutside force had hurled it to the floor. The stolid Jenkins was\nsomewhat perturbed when he found the dead mouse.\n\n\"But how could it get in here,\" he demanded querulously. Then, as if in\nsudden thought, \"and what could have killed it?\"\n\nMel suddenly decided that it might be better if the other were set at\nease since even Jenkins could dissect it if he became curious enough and\nmight find enough to make Neil suspicious.\n\n\"I saw it yesterday,\" he said. \"I didn't say anything since it was\ninteresting and was company for me. I noticed that it was moving more\nslowly today and seemed to be weaker. It must have starved to death.\nNothing to eat in here, and he couldn't get out.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed the other, picking it up and throwing it into a\nwastepaper basket. The explanation had evidently satisfied him, since he\nwent about his routine tasks.\n\n\n\nAfter the excitement of his discovery had worn off, Mel began to\ncautiously test its potential. He carefully directed his thoughts at\nJenkins and caused an instant reaction. For a brief moment, he felt a\nresilient pressure as if something were pressing against his own brain.\nHe instinctively pushed back harder and heard Jenkins yell as the\nopposing pressure collapsed. The assistant was leaning against a work\ntable, a dazed look on his face.\n\n\"What happened?\" Mel asked.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said the other, pressing a hand to the side of his head.\n\"It felt as if something had hit me in the head, now it aches a little.\nGuess I'll have to do something about this cold.\" He left, still holding\na hand to his head.\n\nIt was obvious that his newly discovered power could be dangerous so Mel\nproceeded with his experimenting more slowly. Jenkins was still his only\nguinea pig and he learned to gage just when the assistant's resistance\nwas about to collapse and reduce the intensity of his own probing\naccordingly. He was disappointed to discover that either it was\nimpossible to read another's mind or that he hadn't discovered the\nmethod. However, he could roughly direct the other's actions. Jenkins\nhad been becoming increasingly nervous so Mel became even more subtle in\nhis experimenting. He'd wait until the assistant was idle and then\neither make him cross his legs or put one or the other of his hands up\nto scratch his head. He finally became so smooth and accurate in his\ncontrol that it lost most of its interest as a means of recreation.\n\nHe began to extend his range. Wood and concrete offered no impedance at\nall. Metal, with the exception of aluminum, cut the intensity roughly\nabout half. Jenkins was in Mel's room when he first probed Neil's brain.\nHis partner's mental resistance was much higher and he pressed slowly\nbut methodically so that the break-through would be controlled. To his\nsurprise, he found that Neil's brain was much easier to control than\nthat of Jenkins had been.\n\nIt was about this time that he found he was beginning to master the\nsharing of his host's eyesight. While he might not be able to read\nanother's mind, it would be a big help to know what someone else was\ndoing or what he was looking at. He tried searching outside the building\nbut found nothing, other than an occasional small spot of resistance\nthat would probably indicate a small animal. This wasn't surprising\nsince the lab was hidden in caves in a secluded canyon that had no\nattraction to the casual wanderer.\n\nHis next concentration was on the animals he encountered every so often.\nHis first few attempts resulted in sudden and complete collapse of\nresistance and he sadly concluded that his control had been too powerful\nand resulted in their death. He tried more carefully and was overjoyed\nwhen he established contact with their visual senses. The sensation was\nalmost as over-powering as if he had suddenly gained eyesight of his\nown. For the first time in months, he revelled in seeing the country\naround the outside of the lab and never before had he thought it so\nbeautiful. Once, while in control of a rabbit's mind, he saw an eagle\nflying overhead. He quickly transferred and, before the bird flew far\nenough away to make control impossible, he enjoyed the far-reaching\nvision of the bird's eyes as it swept on towards some hidden nest. He\ncould even see the city in the distance.\n\n\n\nSeveral times he neglected to notice Neil's entrance into the room, so\nabsorbed did he become in his newly discovered, if second-hand, freedom.\n\n\"What's happened to you anyway?\" demanded his erstwhile partner one day\nafter he had had to repeat a question. \"Half of the time lately you're\nlost in a world of your own. What're you up to anyway?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" replied Mel, suddenly alert to any new danger, although\nconfident he could take care of himself now. \"I was just going over some\nnew equations I've been formulating as a hobby. Now that you've taken\naway my cart, there isn't much to keep me occupied you know. You don't\nbegin to bring enough problems. What's wrong?\"\n\nMel wished that he could read the other's mind since Neil began to act\nevasive. He laughed with a false heartiness. \"Wrong? Why I've--we've--\"\nhe corrected, \"--already made a fortune on a couple of our own patents\nas well as commissions from project solutions. Someone might get\nsuspicious if we did too well or too much.\"\n\nThis made sense but Mel couldn't resist digging. \"You mean that your\npast record of success as measured against your supposed one now might\nmake the police ask questions?\" he asked. The other remained silent so\nhe pressed the attack. \"Or are they already wondering why I haven't been\nseen for so long?\"\n\n\"There were a few questions at first,\" admitted the other, \"but I think\nI've satisfied them all. However, I've been thinking that it might be a\ngood idea to move you somewhere else.\"\n\n\"But hardly anyone knows the lab exists,\" protested Mel.\n\n\"The power company does, even if the meters are way down the road. We\nshould've planned on our own generators from the first. Then there's the\ndeed recorder. This land is in both of our names you know.\"\n\n\"It'd still be a tremendous project,\" pointed out Mel. \"You couldn't\nbegin to keep the new location secret because you'd need help in moving\nme. One little slip and it'd be all over.\"\n\nThere was an upward curl to the other's lips that Mel didn't like. \"Oh,\nwe'd have to be careful,\" he admitted. \"Luckily the time delay wouldn't\nhurt any, there's so much money rolling in.\" He hesitated for a moment,\nas if in thought, then concluded, \"In fact, there's no project on now\nunless you have a private one of your own. It might be a good idea to\nplan on the move right away.\"\n\n\"I still don't like the idea,\" stated Mel flatly. \"I'd like to think it\nover for a couple of days.\"\n\n\"Think it over all you want,\" said Neil with a grin. He walked to the\ncalculator and patted it near the jolter. \"Only don't forget I don't\nhave to ask you.\" He waited almost hopefully but Mel said nothing,\ncontent with the feeling of power and knowledge that, so long as he was\nprepared, the other could do nothing immediate to harm him. The time had\ncome for action, however.\n\nMel kept mental contact with his partner after he had left. Neil went\ndirectly to the office and unlocked the center drawer of his desk. He\nthen began pulling out papers and scanning them rapidly, placing some\nback and keeping others out. Mel gasped to himself when he saw the bank\nstatement and the amount of money deposited under the name of the\npartnership. That in Neil's personal account was large but it was\nperfectly obvious, according to dates Mel could see through the other's\neyes, that the transfer of funds had not been underway for long. As it\nnow stood, they were both practically millionaires but he knew Neil\nwouldn't be satisfied.\n\nWatching through the other's eyes, Mel had his vision switched from the\ndesk to the door. He saw that Jenkins had just entered, mouth moving. He\nthought he could read his lips just enough to make out his own name.\nJenkins appeared to stop and listen to Neil, then his facial expression\nchanged as his lips protested over something. Mel's vision then switched\nto another desk drawer that had been opened and he saw his missing\nrevolver nesting in it. Neil withdrew it and pointed it at Jenkins. The\nassistant stepped back, hands up as if to ward off a blow. Then a\nplacating, if anxious, smile spread over his face and his mouth worked\nrapidly, too much so for Mel to read any words. Whatever had been said,\nit appeared to satisfy Neil since he lowered the revolver.\n\n\n\nMel broke contact and came back to his own room and stationary video\nscanners that served as his eyes. Jenkins came in and his manner made it\nplain to Mel that he was laboring under an intense pressure. He began\nputtering around the work table, gradually making his way closer to the\ntank housing Mel's brain.\n\n\"Jenkins,\" said Mel, purposely extra loud.\n\nThe assistant jumped nervously, dropping a piece of metal he had picked\nup.\n\n\"Yes,\" he almost quavered.\n\n\"Have you ever thought how it would be to be condemned to a life like\nmine?\"\n\n\"No-o-o, not especially. Why should I?\"\n\n\"You helped put me here, you know.\"\n\n\"I was only following orders, I--\"\n\n\"All right, all right. I know how Neil can force a person to do\nsomething. But you could help me, you know.\"\n\n\"How's that?\" suspiciously. \"I'm not going to tell anyone, if that's\nwhat you're driving at.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not trying to get you to do that. All I want is the fuse\nreplaced on the cart. Then it would feel as if I were moving around and\nbreak up the monotony. This is worse than any solitary cell in prison\ncould ever be.\"\n\n\"No,\" refused the assistant flatly. \"It wouldn't do you any good anyway.\nIt's just--\" He stopped, hand going to his mouth as if he had said\nsomething he wasn't supposed to.\n\n\"How's that, Jenkins?\" reminded Mel as gently as he could. \"What's\nsupposed to happen?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Jenkins sullenly.\n\n\"Put a fuse back in the cart,\" directed Mel. At the same time he applied\npressure almost to the breaking point against the other's mind.\n\n\"No!\"\n\nHe knifed through to the other's brain with ease and just enough power\nto accomplish his purpose without harming Jenkins. This was the most\ncomplete control Mel had ever attempted and Jenkins' legs moved\nspasmodically as though he were a puppet on strings. There was horror in\nhis bulging eyes and sweat began breaking out on his forehead.\nRelentlessly he was forced towards the cart until at last it had been\nreached.\n\n\"Jenkins,\" said Mel as low as he could. \"Can you hear me?\" A slight\ntwitch of the head was the only indication that he could, so Mel\ninstructed,\n\n\"There's a spare fuse near the holder, Jenkins. Take it out and place it\nin the primary circuit. Do that and I'll let you go. If need be, I could\nkill you now. The fuse, Jenkins.\" He relaxed his hold slightly but\nJenkins made no attempt to comply. Mel continued,\n\n\"Remember the dead mouse, Jenkins? I did that. The fuse, before I lose\nmy patience.\" He applied more power until the other's hand began moving\nunsteadily towards the cart. As he withdrew slightly, from mental\ncontact, Jenkins continued his task and in a moment Mel was able to move\nthe cart. He had momentarily forgotten Jenkins until he became aware\nthat the assistant had let out a yell of terror and was rushing for the\ndoor. Mel watched with amusement, knowing that he could have stopped the\nother with hardly a strain. Just before he reached the door, it opened\nand Neil appeared. Jenkins came to a halt and stared in terror at his\nemployer.\n\n\"Well,\" said the other impatiently. \"What's been keeping you, Jenkins?\nDid you--\"\n\n\"No, he didn't,\" answered Mel. At the same time he caused the cart to\nmove sideways and swung the video scanner until it was staring directly\nat Neil.\n\n\"Well,\" said the latter accusingly, switching his gaze to the terrified\nJenkins. \"So this is how you follow out orders.\"\n\n\"He made me do it, boss. He made me,\" babbled Jenkins as Neil, face set\nwith determination, drew his revolver from a pocket. Before the\nastounded Mel could do more than gaze incredulously, there were two\nsharp cracks and Jenkins slowly placed his arms around his stomach and\nrocked back and forth in agony, before toppling over to the floor to lie\nmotionless.\n\n\"Now you,\" said Neil, swinging his revolver towards Mel's tank. Mel\nfrantically stabbed at his partner's mind but could feel no pressure.\nAnother shot rang out and he felt a numbing pressure seemingly from\nevery direction that could only mean it was against his physical brain\nitself. The shock forced him to use every bit of power he possessed to\nkeep conscious. Neil had lowered the revolver a trifle and was saying in\na superior tone,\n\n\"Whatever you did to Jenkins, it's only hastened the inevitable, if that\nmakes you feel any better. I'd have had to get rid of him too, once you\nwere disposed of.\"\n\nHe began raising the revolver again and the dazed Mel instinctively\nrelayed power to the cart. The eye had been pointing directly at Neil\nand the only sound that indicated the energy gun had been set off was a\nslight hiss. The effect on Neil was not only instantaneous but horrible\nto see. His body appeared to swell until he looked bloated, then\ndisintegrated.\n\n\n\nMel felt himself becoming weak and hastily brought the cart over to\nexamine the damage the one shot had done to him. Almost fearfully he\nscanned himself and saw, with relief, that the shot had penetrated the\ntank and was letting the life-giving liquid escape onto the floor. A\nquick glance into the tank showed that the lead pellet had missed his\nbrain but the pressure on the liquid had caused him the initial pain.\n\nHe directed the cart over to the work bench and brought back a tapered\npiece of wood. The arm placed it into the hole and then applied pressure\nuntil the trickle had stopped. It would do until he could effect a\npermanent patch. He began to feel stronger almost immediately and knew\nthat the automatic features of his metal \"body\" were renewing the liquid\nat top speed.\n\nUsing the cart, he first checked the supply of chemicals, fed as needed\ninto the tank, and saw that there was a sufficient quantity to last him\nfor at least a month. He thanked the good fortune that had allowed\nJenkins to put the cart into operation before it was too late. Without\nit, his end would have been as certain as if Neil had been successful in\nkilling him.\n\nHis first task was to construct several more carts, each complete with\nvideo scanner. One of them was larger than the other. It's first task\nwas to dispose of the two putrefying bodies. Working almost 24 hours a\nday, he hooked an inter-communications system to every room of the\nunderground lab and directly into his system. Even the telephone was\nconnected to it so that, if necessary, he could answer it or make a\ncall.\n\nThe day finally arrived when there was no more he could do. The entire\nlab was almost like a steel and concrete body, so thoroughly had its\nevery function been integrated as part of his brain. The decision he had\nbeen almost frantically avoiding could no longer be put aside. He had\napproximately a week in which to decide. It would be simple to call the\npolice and in turn let them notify the various scientists as to his\nposition.\n\nHe dreaded the thought of the circus that the lab would become.\nErstwhile friends would troop in to look at him with morbid curiosity.\nThen when his potential became known, tasks would be assigned. There was\na definite possibility that he would be moved, even at the danger of\ninjury to himself. Countless thousands would demand it and their will\nwould be obeyed unless the curtain of national security could be drawn\nacross him.\n\nOne day was spent in contacting the animals outside the lab and\nrevelling in flight for awhile. Then he sped through the countryside,\nfirst with a coyote, then with a deer. There was a possibility that if\nthe scientists moved him, his new tank would be shielded so that it\nwould be impossible to enjoy himself as he now was. All in the name of\nscience of course.\n\nOn the other hand, if it were possible to have all supplies delivered to\na nearby point where he could pick them up, he could continue his\npresent method of existence. His mind jumped eagerly from problem to\nproblem which he could undoubtedly solve for the benefit of mankind. The\npresent patents in the partnership's name would bring enough money\nindefinitely to pursue them since much could be done by pure thought.\n\nThere was the survival phase first. He would devise an electronic\nblanketing ray that would dampen all atomic explosions. Then he could\nturn to the health of people all over the world, wipe out diseases. All\nthis would depend, of course on his being able to remain undisturbed and\nthat might tax his powers to their utmost. He wondered if it would be\nworth the effort.\n\nFinally he had less than three days left, which narrowed the safety\nmargin to the lowest point he cared to think about. He opened the\ntelephone circuit and heard the operator say, \"Number please.\"\n\nHe hesitated briefly, then said,\n\n\"The Waring Chemical Supply House, please.\" His order was soon placed\nand, afterwards, he felt almost as free and elated as when, as a boy,\nschool had let out for the summer. The manual dexterity of the metallic\nfingers he had constructed would enable him to write checks with his own\nsignature. A faint idea had even tickled his curiosity and he felt\ncertain that he could grow cells within a couple of weeks. From there,\nhe could work on a body for himself, one even more efficient than the\nold one Neil had destroyed.\n\nA human in the lab at that moment would have been startled. As near\npossible as it was for any wheeled vehicle to do so, he had several\ncarts almost doing a jig in the main office. His new life had just\nbegun.",
