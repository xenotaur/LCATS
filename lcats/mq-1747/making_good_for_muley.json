    "body": "If there\u2019s a word of truth in that old saying about beauty being only\nskin deep, Susie Abernathy was the thinnest-skinned person I ever saw.\nI may not be a judge of womanly beauty, and the poetry of my soul may\nhave been shook loose by pitching broncos, and buried deep under a\ncoating of alkali dust, but I sure do sabe when a woman is hard to\nlook at.\n\nSeems to me like it\u2019s human nature for a feller with squirrel-teeth,\nno jaw to speak about and a physique like a corn cultivator to marry a\nbeautiful female, and vice versa\u2014not that \u201cMuley\u201d Bowles qualifies in\nthe beauty division, but at that I reckon he shaded Susie a little.\n\nMuley was a poetical puncher, of considerable avoirdupois, and he\nfound Susie a thing of beauty and a joy forever. Susie was a niece of\nZeb Abernathy, who owned a sheep outfit on Willow Creek, and a grouch\ntoward all cowmen\u2014and Muley punched cows for the Cross J outfit, and\ndrew forty a month from old man Whittaker.\n\nI\u2019m not belittling Muley\u2019s salary, \u2019cause I drew the same, and so did\n\u201cTelescope\u201d Tolliver and \u201cChuck\u201d Warner. Back in the dim and distant\npast, when cows first come into style, the old-timers got together and\nsettled the pay of the average cow-hand.\n\nThey figured that any normal puncher\u2014if there is such an animal\u2014would\ntry at least three turns of the roulette wheel, at ten dollars per\nturn. That left him ten dollars. He\u2019d buy some tobacco, some red\nneckties and perfume, and what was left, at two-bits a drink for\nhooch, would just carry him a few inches short of the murder and\nsudden death stage.\n\nI\u2019ve just been up to the house to draw my stipend from the old man,\nand am on my way back to the bunk-house, when Muley rides in. He\u2019s\nhumped over in his saddle, like Misery going to a cemetery, and if you\ncan stamp despair on a full-sized milk-cheese he had it on his face.\n\nHe slips his saddle off, turns his bronc into the corral, leans\nagainst the fence and cuts loose the granddaddy of all sighs. There\nain\u2019t many men that you can hear sigh at pointblank range for a\n.30-30, but you could with Muley. It was like releasing the air on a\nfreight train.\n\nI wanders down there and passes the time of day with him, but he don\u2019t\nrespond. He exhausts deep into his soul once more, and hangs up his\nsaddle.\n\n\u201cSome of your relatives die, Muley?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cHello, Hen,\u201d says he, sad-like, \u201cI ain\u2019t got no relatives\u2014except one\naunt. I don\u2019t know whether she\u2019s alive or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cName of Bowles?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope. Name\u2019s Allender. Maw\u2019s name was Allender, and that\u2019s why I was\nnamed Lemule Allender, and\u2014what do you want to know for?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sighed a couple of times,\u201d I reminds him, and he nods and looks\noff across the range.\n\n\u201cHenry, how can I make some money? Regular money. I can\u2019t get along on\nforty a month\u2014no more.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou aim to marry Susie Abernathy?\u201d I asks.\n\nMuley digs a little trench with the toe of his boot, and shakes his\nhead, sad-like\u2014\n\n\u201cNo-o-o, I reckon not, Hen.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust come from there?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cUh-huh. Listen, Hen: can you keep a secret? I know danged well that\nyou can\u2019t, but I got to talk to somebody. Me and Susie\u2019s got it all\nframed up to get married, but she argues that I got to see Zeb. Susie\nain\u2019t of age yet, and Zeb is her guardian, Sabe?\n\n\u201cBelieve me, Henry, if I owned a penitentiary I\u2019d hire Zeb. I\u2019d a\nkilled him a long time ago if it wasn\u2019t for Susie, \u2019cause no sheep-man\ncan tell me where to head in at\u2014dang his old billy-goat face! He\u2019s a\ndarned\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot to change the subject, Muley,\u201d says I, \u201cbut why don\u2019t you ask\nhim?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did. Do you think I\u2019d feel this way over futures? You\u2019re darn well\nright I asked him! Know what he said? He said to me, just like this:\n\u2018Mister Bowles, you keep away from Miss Abernathy. She\u2019s got her\nsights set higher than a forty-dollar puncher.\u2019\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what he said, Henry, and then I said: \u2018Mister Abernathy,\nyou\u2019re tilting that gun for her: let her do her own shooting,\u201d and he\nsaid, \u2018Your reputation ain\u2019t none too good, and if the Vigilantes ever\norganize here Susie would be a widow.\u2019 \u2018You wouldn\u2019t know it,\u2019 says I,\n\u2018\u2019cause they\u2019d get you first.\u2019\n\n\u201cMuley,\u201d says I, \u201cwhich one of you shot first?\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither one. I beat him on the draw, but you can\u2019t kill your\nsweetheart\u2019s guardian. It ain\u2019t ethical, Hen. He told me that any old\ntime I could show enough money to buy out his herd I could have Susie.\nI told him I wasn\u2019t in the habit of buying either sheep or wives, and\nhe said he knowed that without me telling him. Said that no\nforty-a-month puncher was ever that foolish.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about Susie\u2014does she love you, Muley?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d he sighs, \u201cshe sure does. I don\u2019t know how she can, but she\ndoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know either, Muley, but it takes all kinds of folks to make a\nworld.\u201d\n\n\u201cI been thinking of marriage for a long time,\u201d he sighs, \u201cI been\nafraid to ask her, but today she up and kissed me, and that settled\nit, Hen. Funny what a little kiss will do thataway. It makes me\ndesperate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would have done the same to me, Muley. If a girl like her kissed\nme I\u2019d likely turn outlaw. You aim to go to Chicago with that train of\ncows?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t, Hen. I hope the old man don\u2019t ask me to. You going?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Telescope and Chuck are going, but the old man wants me to act as\nforeman while they\u2019re gone\u2014he\u2019s going, too. I\u2019ll ask him to let you\nstay, if you want me to, Muley.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love you like a brother, Hen,\u201d he sighs, \u201cI want to be near her.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s Muley. Being of a poetical temperament he has to confide in\nfolks. If me or Telescope or Chuck got kissed by a lady we\u2019d cherish\nthe memory to our graves\u2014unless it was Susie, and think of it only\nwhen alone.\n\nI ain\u2019t so bad to look upon, and a lady couldn\u2019t be censured for\ngiving me a kiss, but when it comes to Telescope and Chuck\u2014well, I\nsuppose they\u2019ll eventually marry beautiful women.\n\nTelescope is built like a bed-slat, and orates openly that he\u2019s a twig\nof the Tolliver tree, which flourished and bought colored help in\nKentucky before the plans were drawn for the pyramids. Chuck Warner\ndon\u2019t claim nothing, and don\u2019t get sore if you subtract from his\nancestry. He was born west of the Arizona line, and if he descended\nfrom anybody it was Ananias.\n\nChuck\u2019s legs are as short as his memory, and he was born with the face\nof a horse and the trusting eyes of an angel. He never told the truth\nbut once. A big feller, from down below Mesquite, took him down and\nbumped his head on the ground.\n\n\u201cYou got enough?\u201d asks the big person, and Chuck howls\u2014\n\n\u201cPlenty!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t lying, are you?\u201d asks the feller, after he lets Chuck up.\n\nChuck brushes off his clothes and shakes his sore head:\n\n\u201cNo! Dang it all! I wasn\u2019t in no position to lie about it!\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nMuley told me that I couldn\u2019t keep a secret, and I didn\u2019t. Me and\nChuck and Telescope rides to town that afternoon, to foller out the\nusual program expected of punchers with a month\u2019s pay aboard, and I\ntells them about Muley\u2019s troubles.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s more to be censured than pitied,\u201d admits Chuck. \u201cI don\u2019t blame\nZeb, but I do hate a shepherd what thinks a puncher ain\u2019t good enough\nfor his relatives.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoor Muley,\u201d says Telescope, sad-like, \u201cany man what is just one aunt\nshy of being an orphan has my sympathy. I\u2019ll promise you, Hen, that\nI\u2019ll do all I can.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Muley\u2019s name I thanks you,\u201d says I, \u201cbut if you can\u2019t do it for\nMuley don\u2019t do it on my account. I ain\u2019t going to marry her. I just\nfeel sorry for him. I\u2019d feel sorry for anybody what was in love with\nSusie.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe ain\u2019t exactly of the vampire type,\u201d agrees Chuck. \u201cMuley\u2019s got\none dead immortal cinch though: nobody\u2019s going to come along and steal\nher away from him.\u201d\n\n\u201cZeb says he\u2019ll have to marry her over his dead body or bring money\nenough to buy out his sheep,\u201d says I.\n\n\u201cThe latter is the more revolting,\u201d says Telescope. \u201cTell Muley we\u2019ll\nfix it for him after we get back if we have to steal Zeb\u2019s sheep so he\nwon\u2019t have nothing to sell.\u201d\n\nThe next few days we\u2019re a busy crew, loading twenty cars of beef for\nChicago, and we don\u2019t have much time for conversation. Muley is too\nfat to herd \u2019em up the chute, so he sets down cross-legged on top of a\ncar, and checks off the loads. Zeb Abernathy comes over to the yards\nand sets down on top of the fence, along with a lot of other loafers,\nand when Telescope sees him he crosses the corral and sets down beside\nZeb.\n\n\u201cHowdy, Zeb,\u201d says Telescope, rolling a smoke. \u201cYou going to leave\nhere after you sells out, or are you going to make your home with\nSusie and her husband?\u201d\n\n\u201cHu-u-u-u-h?\u201d grunts Zeb, amazed-like, \u201cwhat\u2019s that you said?\u201d\n\n\u201cHaw, haw, haw!\u201d laughed Telescope, slapping Zeb on the back. \u201cYou\ncan\u2019t keep things like that a secret around here, old-timer. What\u2019ll\nwe bring to the charivari\u2014sheep-shears or tin cans?\u201d\n\nZeb sets there, working his jaws faster and faster over his tobacco,\nand pretty soon he looks up at Muley. Muley grins at him, and nods.\nThat\u2019s the last straw.\n\n\u201cMuley\u2019s going to buy out Zeb and marry his niece,\u201d slates Telescope\nto Johnny Myers, owner of the Triangle brand. \u201cMuley\u2019s going to be a\nsheep-king, Johnny.\u201d\n\nAll this time Zeb has been getting off the fence, and he\u2019s so mad that\nhe dances a jig in the dust when he hits the ground.\n\n\u201cYa-a-a-a-ah!\u201d he whoops, waving his long arms like a swarm of bees\nwas after him. \u201cTelescope Tolliver, you\u2019re a liar if you think it!\nMarry that fat, forty-dollar fool! Buy my herd! Say, he ain\u2019t never\nhad money enough to buy a wool sock! Ya-a-a-a-ah! You think you\u2019re\nfunny, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYa-a-a-ah!\u201d mimics Chuck, wiggling his ears. \u201cZebbie, you\u2019re\nlearning. Now the chorus\u2014ba-a-a-a-a-ah!\u201d\n\nZeb\u2019s feelings can\u2019t stand no more, so he turns around like a man with\na sore throat, and goes back toward town stiff-legged like a bear with\na peeve on.\n\n\u201cZeb loves you fellers,\u201d laughs Johnny. \u201cI heard him say this morning\nthat there\u2019s just five things he hates. One is a rattlesnake and the\nother four draws a salary from Whittaker. What\u2019s he sore at you\nfellers for? Has the sheep affected his brain?\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch a theory is absurd, Johnny,\u201d says I. \u201cIt can\u2019t be proved, \u2019cause\nnobody with brains ever mixes up with sheep. You can\u2019t corrupt a\ncoyote.\u201d\n\nA little later on me and Muley are setting on the fence, when\nTelescope climbs up beside us and talks to Muley like a father.\n\n\u201cYou realize what this here marriage stuff means, Muley?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cYou sure you ain\u2019t just sick like a calf for it\u2019s maw?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know my own heart, liver and lights, Telescope,\u201d replies Muley.\n\n\u201cReally love her with all your heart and soul, eh? Say, I\u2019ll bet you\u2019d\nturn her down cold if it was to your advantage.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou dang well know I wouldn\u2019t!\u201d\n\n\u201cSuppose,\u201d says Telescope, \u201csuppose somebody said to you: \u2018Muley, I\u2019ll\ngive you a year\u2019s salary if you\u2019ll keep away from Susie?\u2019 What would\nyou do?\u201d\n\n\u201cMe? I\u2019d rise up on my hind legs and inform him that my love ain\u2019t for\nsale. Sabe? Not for the salary of a lifetime.\u201d\n\nTelescope thinks it over for a while, and then shakes his head,\nsad-like:\n\n\u201cMaybe you would, Muley. I sure hopes you gets them sheep, \u2019cause you\nqualifies for the shepherd class without no fixing. I\u2019ve read about\nlove making a fool out of a man, but\u2014well, it ain\u2019t no funeral of\nmine.\u201d\n\nThat night we shakes hands with Telescope and Chuck and the old man,\nand wishes them many happy returns of the day.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give up the ship, Muley,\u201d advises Telescope. \u201cDo a lot of\nthinking while we\u2019re gone, and if you can figure out any way of making\nmoney without robbing a bank, me and Chuck will put her over for you,\neh, Chuck?\u201d\n\n\u201cA stiff upper lip gathers no mustache,\u201d proclaims Chuck, \u201cand a faint\nheart never rustled no sheep, Muley. So-long, you pitch-fork puncher.\nAnd, Hen-ree, don\u2019t fall in love. One shepherd in the family is a\nplenty.\u201d\n\nMe and Muley rides back to the ranch, but Muley ain\u2019t got much to say.\nLove is a queer little animal, and affects folks different. Muley\u2019s\nwas the dark-blue variety, with circles around the eyes.\n\nThe next morning after breakfast Muley gets a sheet of paper and a\npencil, and seems to compose deep-like. After a while he cuts loose a\ndeep sigh, and looks, dreamy-like, at the ceiling.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d says I. \u201cCan I help you in any way, Muley?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d he sighs. \u201cYou can\u2019t appreciate it, \u2019cause you ain\u2019t\ngot no finer feelings, but I\u2019ll recite it to you:\n\n    \u201cI loved a darling angel,\n      And she loved me quite a lot.\n    Her ears are like the clam shell,\n      And I can forget her not.\n    She\u2019s doomed to marry money,\n      And my heart will break, I think,\n    If I don\u2019t wed this angel,\n      I will drown myself in drink.\u201d\n\n\u201cNice sentiment,\u201d I applauded. \u201cBobby Burns never had nothing on you\nexcept the long sound of his r\u2019s, but you\u2019ll have to put off your\ndemise for at least another month. You can\u2019t do an artistic job of\ndrownding in a couple of dollars\u2019 worth of hooch. If you was to get in\nover your depth in liquor, Muley, what brand would you prefer?\u201d\n\nRight then Muley gets sore at me. I finds that you can josh a man\nabout love just so far, and then he turns like a worm and tries to\nbite me.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor the next few days he writes poetry in the evening, and is absent\nmost all day. He ain\u2019t a pleasant critter to talk to, so I spends most\nof my time playing solitaire. One day down in Paradise I runs across\nSusie.\n\n\u201cSeen Muley lately?\u201d I asks, and she shakes her head.\n\n\u201cNo. Uncle Zeb ordered him off the ranch, and since then I\u2019ve only\nseen him at a distance. He\u2014he said he was going to try and convince\nuncle that he\u2019s something more than an ordinary cowboy. Do you think\nhe can, Mister Peck?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot unless uncle loses his sense of sight. Muley is pining away, day\nby day, and unless something comes up to relieve the situation he\u2019ll\nbe able to go through a door without turning the knob. I know this is\na leading question, Miss Abernathy, but would you marry that Lemuel\nBowles if you had a good chance?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy\u2014er\u2014uh-huh,\u201d says she, nodding her head brave-like, while her ears\nget hot enough to light a cigaret on.\n\n\u201cI feel sorry for Muley,\u201d says I, letting her take it any way she\nwants to, and then I lopes away, \u2019cause I sees Zeb coming.\n\nThe next morning we ain\u2019t no more than out of bed when in rides old\nPaddy Morse. Paddy runs the post-office, along with his little store,\nand this is the first time I ever seen him at the Cross J.\n\n\u201cIs Le-mule Allender Bowles to home?\u201d he inquires, peering over his\nspecs at me.\n\n\u201cRight here, Paddy,\u201d says Muley. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\n\u201cLetter for you. Reckon it\u2019s for you, \u2019cause there ain\u2019t no other\nBowles around this here neck of the woods. You got to sign your full\nname, same as on that letter or I can\u2019t let you have it. Sabe?\n\n\u201cThis here is a special delivery letter\u2014darn such things! Uncle Sam\nforces me to ride plumb up here to deliver this or take the\nconsequences, which I believe is three hundred days in jail or a\nyear\u2014sign right on that line. Now, I reckon I\u2019ll go on back. Hope it\nain\u2019t bad news, Muley. Mostly always a letter of that kind or a\ntelegram means death. Come from Milwaukee. You got any kin in\nMilwaukee?\u201d\n\nBut Muley has gone back into the house, and Paddy don\u2019t get the\ninformation he seeks.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later Muley comes down to the bunk-house, where\nI\u2019m putting some rosettes on a new bridle, and he\u2019s got a grin plumb\nacross his fat face. I glances at him and goes on working.\n\n\u201cHenry,\u201d says he, after a little while, \u201cwould you like to have a job\nherding my sheep?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour sheep? Sure. I\u2019ll herd all you got in my sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be the richest man in Yaller Rock County,\u201d he proclaims.\n\n\u201cYou better talk lower, Muley,\u201d I advises. \u201cIf the county\ncommissioners hear you talk thataway they\u2019ll way-bill you to the\nloco-lodge at Warm Springs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou remember me telling you about my Aunt Agnes, Hen? She died.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd left you a sheep?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cSheep\u2014always sheep! Take a look at this.\u201d\n\nHe hands me a letter\u2014the one what Paddy brought him, and I looks her\nover. The brand opines it to be from Milwaukee, and the top of the\nletter proclaims that Frederick & Quincy are lawyers. She listens\nsomething like this:\n\n    Dear Sir:\n\n    It grieves us to inform you that your aunt, Miss Agnes\n    Allender, of this city, died on the fifth day of August,\n    1900.\n\n    According to her last will and testament, you, which she\n    designates as her favorite nephew, will inherit the bulk\n    of her estate, which is valued at about one hundred\n    thousand dollars.\n\n    As you likely know she was a very eccentric person, and\n    her will imposes you as follows: without receiving a cent\n    of said inheritance you must, before the fifteenth day of\n    August, 1900, have invested four-fifths of said hundred\n    thousand dollars in sheep.\n\n    She also designates that: the said Lemuel Allender Bowles\n    must not marry for the space of five years under penalty\n    of forfeiture of entire inheritance. Also that he take a\n    care for Alfred and Amelia for the rest of their natural\n    lives. All of the foregoing requests must be complied with\n    or my estate is to be divided between charitable\n    institutions aforementioned in my will.\n\n    On the fifteenth day of August, 1900, our representative\n    will call on you and examine your investments. We wish you\n    luck.\n\nI hands it back to him, and goes on working.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says he, sort of choking-like, \u201cdon\u2019t I get congratulated?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs soon as I gets time I\u2019m going to feel sorry for you, Muley. How in\nthunder can you invest eighty thousand dollars around here, when\neverybody knows you ain\u2019t got a cent, and everybody hates sheep. You\ncan\u2019t get married for five years, and you\u2019ve got to feed, water and\ngroom Alfred and Amelia all the rest of their natural lives. Wonder\nwhat them twin-sounding things are, Muley?\u201d\n\nMuley sets to thinking it over, and folding and unfolding that letter:\n\n\u201cSince you sympathized with me, things don\u2019t look so rosy,\u201d he admits,\nwith a deep sigh. \u201cReckon I missed that marrying part. If Alfred and\nAmelia got a fair start they ought to be about due. Reckon I\u2019ll ride\ndown to Paradise\u2014dang the luck! I\u2019ve torn that letter plumb in two!\u201d\n\nHe puts the two pieces in his vest pocket and goes off down to the\ncorral.\n\nThe longer I thinks things over the harder it looks for Muley. Muley\nain\u2019t got the reputation of a saint around here, and can\u2019t even lie so\nfolks will believe him. Zeb owns all the visible supply of sheep, and\nMuley ain\u2019t got no time to spare if he\u2019s going to make good.\n\nAlong about noon Muley rides in. He\u2019s got a big bundle under one arm\nand a big box under the other. He deposits his plunder on the steps,\nand sets down. I sets down beside him to wait until he gets through\nsighing, when all to once a squeaky voice yells:\n\n\u201cWay \u2019round \u2019em. Shep! Who\u2019s crazy!\u201d\n\nI hops plumb off the steps, and whirls with my gun ready. Muley looks\nat me, sad-like, and sighs again\u2014\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Alfred, Henry.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlfred?\u201d I asks. \u201cAlfred who?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Nobody introduced me, but it don\u2019t matter\u2014Alfred is a\nparrot.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d says I, \u201cwhat\u2019s Amelia\u2014a lady bug?\u201d\n\n\u201cNaw-w-w! Cat.\u201d\n\n\u201c_Squr-r-r-r-reek! Sheep dip! Sheep dip! Har, har, har! Squr-r-reek!_\u201d\nannounces Alfred.\n\n\u201cHen, what\u2019s the natural life of a parrot?\u201d asks Muley, without\nlifting his head.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Why the question?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat letter specifies \u2018natural lifetime.\u2019 That\u2019s the joker.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid it say that?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure did. Wait, I\u2019ll show you.\u201d He fumbles around in his pockets for\na while, and then looks foolish-like at me: \u201cThe front half of that\nletter is gone, Henry! Now, where in thunder did I drop that?\u201d\n\nHe hunts some more but his pockets don\u2019t essay a trace.\n\n\u201cHar, har, har! Way \u2019round \u2019em, Shep!\u201d shrieks Alfred, and Muley kicks\nthe cage off the porch.\n\n\u201cShut up! You cross between a duck and a phonygraph! You ain\u2019t yelped\nnothing but sheep-talk since I got you. No wonder Aunt Agnes died\u2014she\nmust have had ticks!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t showing proper respect for the dead, Muley,\u201d I reminds him.\n\n\u201cIs that so!\u201d he yelps. \u201cIs that so! Well, dog-gone it, Hen, she\ndidn\u2019t show no respect for the living when she shipped me these\ntrinkets, did she? Sending a puncher a sheep-talking buzzard ain\u2019t\nshowing a whole lot of respect. That cat is so old I\u2019ll have to feed\nit on a bottle, and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSheep dip!\u201d screams Alfred. \u201cWho\u2019s crazy?\u201d\n\nMuley throws his coat over the cage, and slams the whole works into\nthe house. He follers it inside, and I sets there for a while thinking\nthings over. The slats on Amelia\u2019s home ain\u2019t none too secure, so I\nloosens one end, and as I goes inside the bunk-house I sees Amelia\ntrotting off toward the barn.\n\nMuley comes down after a while and sets down on the bunk. \u201cAlfred\ndanged near bit my finger off, and Amelia\u2019s made her getaway, Hen,\u201d he\nannounces in a sad voice. \u201cAmelia was down there on the corral fence,\nmaking faces at Chuck\u2019s coyote pup, and she offers fight when I tries\nto calm her spirits. Aunt Agnes must have been a nut over ferocious\nanimals.\u201d\n\n\u201cNevertheless she was your mother\u2019s sister, and left you all her\nwealth,\u201d I chides him.\n\n\u201cYah! Like throwing both ends of a rope to a drownding man, and\nforgetting to hang on to the middle. Can\u2019t marry for five\u2014huh!\u201d\n\nHe gets up and stomps out of the place, and I opines that Muley\u2019s\ninheritance is beginning to bear down upon his immortal soul.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next day Hank Padden, who owns the Seven A outfit, shows up, and\nsets down with me in the parlor. Muley is washing up, and when Hank\nasks for him he yells that he\u2019ll be out in a minute.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make Muley an offer,\u201d says Hank to me, confident-like.\n\u201cI hears that he\u2019s going to get married, and I needs a foreman what is\na married man. Sabe? Single men ain\u2019t got nothing to hold \u2019em down. I\nlike Muley\u2014dang his fat carcass\u2014and I rides over here to see him.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d says I, \u2019cause there ain\u2019t nothing else to say, and then\nHank yells at Muley:\n\n\u201cCome out here, you half-ton puncher! I want to talk to you about\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSheep dip! Sheep dip! Har, har, har!\u201d\n\nI know it\u2019s Alfred, but if it don\u2019t sound like Muley I\u2019ll eat my\nquirt. Same little wheeze that Muley has in his laugh.\n\nHank comes to his feet like a shot, and glares at the half-closed\ndoor. He puts on his hat, walks straight out of the door, gets on his\nbronc and fogs away from the Cross J.\n\nI hears a crash in the next room, a couple of shrieks, and out comes\nAlfred with most of his tail feathers missing. He sails around the\nroom a couple of times, finally hits the open door, and perches on the\nhitch-rack in front of the house.\n\nMuley comes out, with a shotgun in his hand, and glares around.\n\n\u201cNatural lifetime, Muley,\u201d I informs him, and he tosses the gun on the\nsofa.\n\n\u201cThat bird will be the death of me, Henry!\u201d he wails, \u201cyelping\nsheep-talk at Hank Padden is like lighting a cigaret with a stick of\ndynamite. What did he want of me?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe came over to sympathize with you about your aunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d says Muley, blank-like, looking out of the window. \u201cAin\u2019t this\nWick Smith coming?\u201d\n\nIt was Wick. He ties his bronc and comes inside. To hear him talk\nyou\u2019d think that rheumatism had typhoid-pneumonia and bubonic plague\nbeat so far that you could cure \u2019em both with internal applications of\npeach pie.\n\n\u201cI got to get away from here,\u201d states Wick, after we discusses the\nweather a while. \u201cEvery season I lives here brings me that much nearer\nthe grave. I want to take a pardner into my store, and while I ain\u2019t\ndecided exactly about it, I comes up here to have a talk with Muley. I\nneeds new blood in my place, and I got to have a married man, which\nhas a little money. Sabe?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got any sheep?\u201d I asks.\n\nWick sets up straight and glares at me.\n\n\u201cSheep? I\u2019m a merchant\u2014not a shepherd!\u201d\n\n\u201cWool is good for rheumatism,\u201d says I, offhand-like, trying to smooth\nover my mistake.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a married man with money you sure got into the\nwrong pew, Mister Smith,\u201d states Muley.\n\n\u201cZeb told me that you had an aunt\u2014\u201d begins Wick, wise-like, and then:\n\n\u201c_Squr-r-r-r-reek! Meo-o-o-o-o-ow! Yip, yip, yip!_\u201d\n\nFirst comes Amelia. She\u2019s traveling so blamed fast that she looks like\na string of about six cats. Right behind her comes that coyote pup,\ndigging deep into his soul for joyful sounds, and behind him,\nscreeching and screaming comes Alfred, and they invades the parlor.\n\nWick hops to his feet as they enters, and of course he\u2019s the highest\npoint in the room. A cat will always hit for elevation\u2014therefore Wick\ngot Amelia. Me and Muley sort of draws back to keep the score, but\nthings happens too fast for computation. Amelia draws all four feet\ntogether in Wick\u2019s scalp, the same of which makes Wick wrinkle up his\nface, and forget the rheumatism in his legs. The bird and the coyote\ndon\u2019t do much except cut circles until Wick starts, blind-like to\nleave there, and falls over a chair.\n\nWick turns over once, lands on his hands and knees, and pilgrims out\nof the door, with the cat prospecting his dandruff, Alfred hopping up\nand down on his back, and the coyote pup hanging on to his coattails,\nand skidding along, making little snappy barks of delight.\n\nThey all rolls off the porch, where the three animals tangles up,\nleaving Wick alone. He forks his bronc in a hurry, and sets there\nrubbing the haze out of his eyes.\n\nAmelia is setting a new cross-country record for cats, as she hunts\nfor a high spot, and the pup is singing along right behind her.\n\nAlfred walks circles around a post for a few seconds, and then\nflutters to the top of the hitch-rack. He ruffles up what feathers\nhe\u2019s got left, cocks his head on one side and screeches:\n\n\u201cHar, har, har! Sheep dip! Who\u2019s crazy?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy gosh!\u201d explodes Wick. \u201cThat cyclone hit me so hard that I can see\ngreen eagles and hear \u2019em talk!\u201d and he backs his bronc away,\ncautious-like, and leaves us in a hurry.\n\nMe and Muley looks at each other for a while, and then Muley yawns:\n\n\u201cI must have lost that piece of letter where Zeb could find it. Well,\nit didn\u2019t say nothing about buying sheep, anyway, Hen.\u201d\n\n\u201cLucky it didn\u2019t, Muley. If the community thought you intended to\nbring eighty thousand dollars\u2019 worth of sheep on to this range you\u2019d\nbe the honored guest at a cravat party. Your auntie didn\u2019t understand\nconditions when she wrote that will, Muley.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy emphasize \u2018when she wrote that will,\u2019 Henry!\u201d he asks, sad-like.\n\u201cAfter looking at Alfred and Amelia\u2014well, Henry, there\u2019s a destiny\nwhat shapes our ends.\u201d\n\nNext morning at breakfast we\u2019re interrupted. Comes a thump of feet\noutside the door, and a voice yells\u2014\n\n\u201cHello, the house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHello the \u2014\u2014!\u201d says I. \u201cThat sounds like Zeb Abernathy, Muley.\u201d\n\nMuley steps over and picks up the old man\u2019s shotgun.\n\n\u201cLet him in, Henry,\u201d says he. \u201cIf he comes on the prod I\u2019ll scatter\nhis remains to the four winds.\u201d\n\nI opens the door, and the old pelican bows to me like I was the fourth\nking in the deck to enter his hand.\n\n\u201cHowdy, Henry,\u201d says he, and then he happens to see Muley with the\nshotgun. \u201cI comes in sorrow not in anger,\u201d he states, \u201cmy soul is\nfilled with contrition.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs long as she\u2019s filled with something I\u2019ll save my buckshot,\u201d opines\nMuley. \u201cCome on in and rest your ticks, Zeb Abernathy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNice weather,\u201d observes Zeb, mopping his face with a red\nhandkerchief. \u201cMay rain and it may not. I kind of look for a dry\nspell.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Weather Bureau at Washington gets but annual reports, which reach\nus too late, so we thanks you for the information,\u201d says Muley.\n\n\u201cI hope I see you both well,\u201d opines Zeb.\n\n\u201cYour eyesight don\u2019t worry me none to speak about,\u201d states Muley. \u201cThe\nlast time I meets up with you I made you throw your gun down the well.\nHow\u2019s your sentiments concerning me at present?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m filled with meekness and contrition, as I aforementioned,\nLe-mule. It aches my heart to know that I provoked you thataway, and I\npilgrims over here to make amends. Sabe?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy this sudden change of attitude?\u201d inquires Muley, and Zeb sort of\nsquirms in his chair.\n\n\u201cShe comes to me like a yelp in the night,\u201d says he, pious-like, \u201cI\ngets to thinking thusly: \u2018Le-mule Allender Bowles, I ain\u2019t treated you\nright. I hops on to you like a coyote on a carcass, and reviles you\nabusive-like, \u2019cause you desires to marry into my family. I lets my\ninterest in Susie blind me to her best interests, but now I sheds the\nscales off my eyes, and comes out into the sunshine of true\nunderstanding.\n\n\u201cThe more I thinks about it, Le-mule, the worse I feels. Youth calls\nto youth, and what is stronger than the call of true love? She ain\u2019t\nnever yelped at me, boys, but I\u2019m a heap wise. While Le-mule is only\ngetting forty a month now, I feels that in the due course of time\nhe\u2019ll be a shining light of the community, and maybe go to Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood sentiments, Zeb,\u201d I agrees, \u201cbut it will likely be a close race\nbetween the voters and the sheriff to decide whether he goes to Helena\nor Deer Lodge.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaw! Haw! Haw!\u201d roars Zeb. \u201cMuley will never go to the penitentiary.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot willingly,\u201d I agrees. \u201cWhat are your sheep worth today?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no sheep, Henry,\u201d he grins. \u201cSold out to a feller from St.\nMarie\u2019s basin, and his drive started today. Yep. I\u2019m a civilian now.\u201d\n\n\u201cGot a good price, too,\u201d he grins, when he sees me look foolish-like\nat Muley. \u201cGlad I sold. Too much sentiment against sheep. Well, boys,\nI reckon I\u2019ll toddle along. I couldn\u2019t sleep until I comes over and\nsquares myself with Le-mule. Come over and make yourself to home at my\nplace, Le-mule.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Zeb-uleon,\u201d says Muley, \u201cI may do that little thing,\nZeb-uleon. How\u2019s Susie, Zeb-uleon?\u201d\n\n\u201cTolable, Le-mule. She\u2019s pining.\u201d\n\nWe watches him ride away, and then Muley spits, reflectively:\n\n\u201cHenry, if that old pelican had called me Le-mule once more I\u2019d have\nslaughtered him. He must have found that letter I lost.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ought to invest your money in a detective agency, and run it\nyourself. I suppose you\u2019ll go over to see Susie?\u201d\n\n\u201cDang well know I will! Why not?\u201d\n\n\u201cGo ahead. Go ahead, Muley, and lose a hundred thousand. What\u2019s a\nfortune beside her? Your brain ain\u2019t big enough, Muley. When it gets\nover forty dollars it all looks alike to you. You take my advice and\nbuy sheep.\u201d\n\n\u201cYah-h-h-h!\u201d he blats. \u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat will you give me if I buy \u2019em for you?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cYou? You got a dead aunt, too, Henry?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but I got brains, and I can buy sheep.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo buy \u2019em then!\u201d he snaps, \u201cI\u2019m from Missouri\u2014me.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nMuley rides away in the general direction of his heart\u2019s desire, and I\ngets an inspiration. Over in St. Marie\u2019s basin is plenty of sheep, and\nI never saw a sheep-man yet what wouldn\u2019t sell out. I like Muley.\nDog-gone his irresponsible heart, I like him. His mind ain\u2019t big\nenough to contemplate a hundred thousand dollars, and I feels glad for\nhim that he\u2019s got a friend like me to make good for him.\n\nI may be rewarded for my efforts, and maybe not, but anyway I\u2019ve\nalways wanted to handle big money, and show to the world that Henry\nPeck could be more than he\u2019s ever showed.\n\nI saddles up Glory and puts a pack on Blazer, and leaves a note for\nMuley, telling him that I\u2019ll be back on the fatal day to save him from\nruin. Little Henry is going to be a hero, and hopes to do his heroing\non a commission basis.\n\nI pilgrims over into a country that cowmen designates as being a fair\nexample of the place where sinners will reside in the hereafter, and\neats mutton and talks sheep.\n\nBelieve me I could talk sheep faster than the men that owned the\nherds, and I confides in \u2019em about Muley\u2019s inheritance. Of course I\ndidn\u2019t tell it all, but anyway I got options on enough sheep to cause\nYaller Rock County to build an extra wing on the insane asylum, and\nsaid options didn\u2019t cost me a cent.\n\n\u201cOld Testament\u201d Tilton rides back with me. I\u2019ve spent about fifteen\nthousand of Muley\u2019s credit with him, and being a minister, he\u2019s a\nlittle suspicious of his fellow-men.\n\n\u201cI ride with you for the good of my soul,\u201d orates the old boy, when he\noffers to accompany me.\n\nI reckon that when a shepherd goes into cow-land, it\u2019s like taking a\nship into fresh water to knock off the barnacles.\n\nHe\u2019s a queer old coot. Imagine a man of his cognomen, add the smell of\nsheep, dress him up around the neck like a preacher, tuck his pants\ninto the top of a pair of heavy boots, and you\u2019ve got a portrait of\nOld Testament. He rides a little calico bronc, with one cropped ear\nand a rat-tail, and calls it Ebenezer. The only way, I figure, that he\ncould ever hand out salvation would be by correspondence.\n\n\u201cNow, this here Le-mule Bowles,\u201d remarks the old boy, \u201cdo you think I\ncould induce him to come into the vineyard?\u201d\n\n\u201cMuley will go into anything that\u2019s got a door on it,\u201d says I. \u201cAlso,\nhe\u2019ll take anything what ain\u2019t nailed down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fear me it will be a task,\u201d he says, sad-like, and then he sort of\nbrightens up. \u201cHave you ever considered your soul?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no soul,\u201d says I.\n\n\u201cSay not that you are a lost sheep,\u201d he chides me, and it makes me\nsore, and I points off down the valley.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in cow-land now, old-timer, so you lay off on that lost-sheep\nstuff. Sabe? Down here they calls \u2019em plain strays.\u201d\n\nWe plods down into the Sleeping Creek country, and stops at Hank\nPadden\u2019s place for dinner. Old Testament and Hank are old friends, but\nHank don\u2019t more than give me a nod. I reckon he ain\u2019t forgot what he\nthought was Muley\u2019s voice, and he blames me, too. When we gets ready\nto leave Hank acts like I had a contagious disease.\n\n\u201cDrop in any old time, Tilton,\u201d says Hank. \u201cGlad to see you.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe, too, Hank?\u201d I asks, and he gives me a hard look.\n\n\u201cYou travels on your own responsibility,\u201d he replies.\n\n\u201cI wonder what Hank is sore at me for?\u201d I asks Old Testament, a little\nlater, but he shakes his head, and mumbles something about the flocks\non the seven hills and the wrath to come.\n\n\u201cDid you tell him that I bought them sheep?\u201d I asks, and he nods.\n\n\u201cYea. I did not lie, Henry Peck. I know naught of Bowles.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose you also told him that I was going to stock this here range\nwith sheep, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI merely told him that I surmised so.\u201d\n\nWe rides almost to the Cross J, when we overtakes Abe Evans, the depot\nagent at Paradise.\n\n\u201cGosh! I\u2019m glad you caught me,\u201d pants Abe, \u201cI never was built to fit a\nsaddle, and this here nag ain\u2019t no rocking-chair. Here\u2019s a telegram\nfor Lemule Bowles, charges paid. You sign for it, Hen, and let me go\nback home.\u201d\n\nWe pilgrims on to the ranch, but Muley ain\u2019t there. There\u2019s a note on\nthe table which orates that he\u2019ll be there at three o\u2019clock, and it\u2019s\naddressed to Weinie Lopp, of the Triangle.\n\n\u201cThis here telegram ought to be opened,\u201d opines Old Testament, who is\nas nosey as a pet coon. \u201cA telegram always means that something is\ngoing to happen, and it\u2019s better to be prepared.\u201d\n\nI tears the cover off and looks her over. It says\u2014\n\n       Will arrive your town this date meet me with a vehicle.\n\nAnd she\u2019s signed Frederick & Quincy.\n\nI looks at my watch and decides on quick action.\n\n\u201cYou set down here and rest your feet,\u201d says I to Old Testament, \u201cI\u2019ll\nhitch up the buckboard, and go to town. I just got enough time to get\nthere.\u201d\n\nThat was some ride. Them broncs were as wild as deer, and we went to\nParadise so fast that the dust didn\u2019t settle for thirty minutes after\nI ties up at the station.\n\nThe train is late, so I goes over to Mike Pelly\u2019s place, and washes\nthe sheep-taste out of my throat. It takes quite a lot of liquid, and\nwhen I goes back to the station I\u2019m sheep-proof.\n\nThe train pulls in and I spots my man. There\u2019s quite a crowd at the\nstation, but I knowed him the minute he got off, and it takes me about\nthree steps to get where he\u2019s standing. Being sheep-proof, I\u2019m also\npolite, so I takes his valise away from him, and starts for the rig.\n\n\u201cCome on, Blackstone,\u201d says I, \u201cyour carriage waits without.\u201d\n\nHe starts with me, but he seems to complain a heap, so I stops and\nasks him whyfore the objections.\n\n\u201cWhere the Sam Hill are you taking my bag?\u201d he asks, getting red in\nthe face. \u201cWho told you to take that valise?\u201d\n\n\u201cMister,\u201d says I, \u201cdon\u2019t excite yourself thataway. I\u2019m doing all I can\nto make you comfortable. Sabe? I advises you to come along peaceable,\nand anything you may say will be used against you.\u201d\n\nI always thought that lawyers tried to settle things peaceably, but I\ndon\u2019t reckon this one runs true to form, \u2019cause he hit me so hard\nunder the chin that he drove my head right up to the top of my hat.\nThat hat always was too small, but after that wallop I has to stuff\nthe sweat-band with paper so she\u2019ll fit.\n\nThe train is pulling out when I wakes up, and I sees that fat feller\nstanding on the rear platform.\n\n\u201cWhat was you aiming to do, Hen?\u201d asks Bill McFee, our sheriff, who is\nsetting beside me on the platform.\n\n\u201cThat was the feller I was here to meet, Bill,\u201d says I. \u201cHe\u2019s sure a\nsudden son-of-a-gun for a lawyer.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe ain\u2019t no lawyer, Henry,\u201d says Bill. \u201cHe\u2019s the railroad paymaster,\nand he thought you was trying to steal his roll.\u201d\n\n\u201cWrong man,\u201d says I. \u201cSeen any stranger get off the train?\u201d\n\nBill shakes his head, so I pilgrims around to where I tied my rig, and\nthere sets Telescope, Chuck and the old man. Them three acts like they\nwas tickled stiff, and Telescope yelps at me\u2014\n\n\u201cGot the telegram, did you, Henry?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t have nothing to say, and that seems to make \u2019em more joyful. I\ndon\u2019t keep silent from choice, but that feller darn near unjointed my\njaw and she hurts like thunder when I opens my face.\n\n\u201cMuley still wearing crape?\u201d asks Chuck, as we ride out of town, and\nall three of \u2019em busts out laughing.\n\n\u201cDanged mean trick,\u201d opines the old man. \u201cYou remember Jimmy\nFrederick, don\u2019t you, Hen? He was out here a few years ago. He knows\nMuley well. We were up in his office and Telescope and Chuck got him\nto write that letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many sheep has Muley bought on his nerve?\u201d asks Chuck.\n\n\u201cCome on through, Hen. Did he buy out Zeb\u2019s herd? I hope he ain\u2019t got\nmutton for our supper.\u201d And then Telescope sings sort of plaintive\nlike;\n\n    \u201cI love a little chicken and I love a little fish.\n    When somebody says \u2018ham and eggs,\u2019 I pass along my dish,\n    When I get good and hungry I could eat a roarin\u2019 bull,\n    But when they passes mutton meat my stummick\u2019s full.\u201d\n\nAnd then Chuck joins in the chorus:\n\n    \u201cI\u2019m a tough old rooster, and I\u2019ve eaten snakes,\n    I\u2019ve spread giant powder on my buckwheat cakes,\n    I\u2019ve drank rawhide stew \u2019till I was out of breath,\n    But when they serves up mutton meat I starves to death.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fine bunch of friends!\u201d I snaps, taking a chance that my jaw\nis still on its hinges. \u201cShe was his favorite relative, and since that\nletter he ain\u2019t done nothing but mope. You\u2019re a danged bunch of ghoul\ncomedians. Muley\u2019s due to kill somebody when he finds out about it.\nWhat was the main idea?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d laughs Telescope, \u201cwe made him rich for a while, didn\u2019t we?\nZeb orates that he wants Susie to marry money, so we gave it to him in\na lump. We puts in that marriage clause just to see if Muley loved her\nenough to lose the money, Sabe? We knowed danged well that he couldn\u2019t\nbuy no sheep. What did the parrot have to say, Hen?\u201d\n\n\u201cTold Hank Padden he could use sheep dip.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaw, haw, haw!\u201d whoops Chuck. \u201cDid he honest say that? I sat up all\none night and day trying to teach that parrot some sheep-talk, but all\nit ever did was to bite me. Telescope swiped that cat at the depot in\nMilwaukee.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nJust before we reaches the ranch, three people rides in ahead of us\nand waits for us to come up. It\u2019s Hank Padden, Johnny Myers and\n\u201cScenery\u201d Sims. They all got rifles.\n\nWe exchanges greetings, but they don\u2019t seem glad to see nobody but me.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t aim to be nosey, Mr. Peck,\u201d says Hank, \u201cbut we\u2019d admire to\nhear a little more about them sheep.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat sheep?\u201d I asks, surprised-like.\n\n\u201cOld Testament told me,\u201d says Hank. \u201cHe spoke about you going to start\na herd here and\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI thanks you for the compliment,\u201d says I. \u201cIt seems nice to be\nmistaken for a capitalist, Hank, but what I wants to know is this; how\nlong since have you been taking the word of a shepherd? Do I need to\ndeny it?\u201d\n\n\u201cOld Testament must have lied, Hank,\u201d states the old man. \u201cHe must\nhave been crazy to state such a thing. Somebody\u2019s crazy anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said,\u201d squeaks Scenery. \u201cHen Peck couldn\u2019t buy a pair\nof wool socks.\u201d\n\nThey all nods sort of agreeable-like, and he drives on.\n\n\u201cAfter a while, when there ain\u2019t nobody around to interrupt us, I\u2019m\ngoing to ask you a few questions, Henry,\u201d states Chuck, solemn-like.\n\n\u201cYou better bring a witness,\u201d says I. \u201cAll I wants is an uninterested\nthird party present so I can prove I shot in self-defense.\u201d\n\nWe pulls up to the ranch. The front door is open and two rigs are tied\nout in front. We pilgrims up to the door, and are greeted with some\nsight.\n\nThere\u2019s Old Testament standing in the middle of the room, with his\neyes rolled toward the rafters, while in front of him stands Susie\nAbernathy and Muley Bowles. Muley\u2019s vest is stretched to the bursting\npoint, and you could light a match on Susie\u2019s freckles.\n\nTo one side stands Zeb Abernathy, and on the other stands Weinie Lopp,\nall dressed up in a celluloid collar, and no place to put his hands.\n\nWe hears Old Testament finish up his prayer, and as Muley folds Susie\nto his bosom we troops inside. Muley sees us over Susie\u2019s shoulder,\nand breaks the clinch. Zeb grins out through his whiskers and Weinie\nLopp turns up the collar of his coat.\n\nEverything is still for a few seconds, and then Old Testament smiles\nat me over his specs:\n\n\u201cMy son,\u201d says he, \u201cit\u2019s fortunate that I came with you. I had\nconsidered taking a trip over into the Bitter Roots, and Mister Lopp\nwould have missed me.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d says I, having the understanding of a fish. \u201cAll very true.\nWas Weinie on your trail?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d gurgles Weinie,\u201cI\u2014I was after a preacher for Muley.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2014they just got married,\u201d chuckles Zeb. \u201cJust now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says Chuck, foolish-like, \u201cwho gets the first kiss from the\nbride\u2014after you, Muley?\u201d\n\n\u201cMuley, you\u2019re a hero!\u201d gasps Telescope. \u201cAny man is a hero who will\nsacrifice a hundred thousand dollars at the throne of love. Everybody\ntake off your hats to Muley Bowles.\u201d\n\nEverybody\u2019s got their hats off so we don\u2019t respond.\n\n\u201cWhat did you mean by that, Telescope?\u201d gasps Zeb. \u201cDo\u2014do you mean\nthat he\u2014he\u2019ll lose all that money \u2019cause he married Susie?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said it, Zeb,\u201d grins Telescope. \u201cAin\u2019t you proud of him? What a\nnephew-in-law!\u201d and then he turns to Muley: \u201cMuley, old-timer, I\ndidn\u2019t think you had it in you, but you never can tell which way a\ndill pickle will squirt. How does it seem to lose a hundred thousand\ndollars?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d grins Muley, putting one arm around the shrinking bride. \u201cI\nain\u2019t lying to you when I says I don\u2019t know how it feels. You see,\nTelescope, the name of Allender don\u2019t cover no branch of my\nfamily-tree, and I never had any Aunt Agnes.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a painful silence for a minute, and then comes a flutter of\nfeathers, and in waddles Alfred. He ain\u2019t got no tail-feathers left,\nand the rest of his carcass is pretty well plucked. He looks us over,\nwild-eyed, ruffles up his remaining foliage, croaks:\n\n\u201cHar, har, har! Who\u2019s crazy?\u201d\n\nZeb looks wide-eyed at the bird for a moment, and then sneaks past it\nand out on the steps:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going away,\u201d says he in a low, hoarse voice. \u201cGoing away before\nthat bird answers its own questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cTally three more,\u201d states Telescope, and him and Chuck and the old\nman sneaks out.\n\n\u201cMake it five,\u201d says I, and me and Weinie goes out, too.",
