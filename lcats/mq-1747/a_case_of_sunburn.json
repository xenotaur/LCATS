    "body": "Jonner's hand dropped to his pistol and he edged cautiously behind a\nbig rock as another groundcar appeared among the dunes to the south and\napproached the little group of men. He was sure Sir Stanrich had told\nhim there were to be four others in his little task force: and there\nwere four with him now.\n\nBut the new groundcar did not approach like a hostile patrol car. There\nwas an air of confidence about the way its driver swung it up to the\nothers. Jonner held his hand, thinking furiously, as the airtight door\nswung open and the newcomer leaped lightly to the ground.\n\nThe sun was settling over the iron-red wastes of the Isidis Desert. The\ngroundcars clustered like giant beetles at the top of the cliff that\ndropped straight down to the shadowed lowland of Syrtis Major. The six\nmen in marsuits, huddled at rendezvous, kept their helmet radios low,\nfor Mars City was less than fifty miles east of them.\n\nWith the twilight, the blue mist of Mars was beginning to settle toward\nthe ground.\n\nJonner debated with himself. Could he have misunderstood Sir Stanrich?\nOr could the plans have been changed after he left the Isidis\nspaceport? No. Then who was the sixth man? And which man was he?\n\n\"Regina fell right after I left,\" said the burly, gray-haired man.\nThat would be Tyruss, the former space captain, who had come here from\nRegina. \"Our troops were falling back along the Hadriacum Lowland. I\nsuppose they plan to make a stand before Charax.\"\n\n\"No, Charax is to be evacuated tonight,\" said Jonner, and savored the\nshock of that announcement on his hearers.\n\nHe studied the credentials each man had handed him on arrival. There\nwas Tyruss, from Regina. There was Farlan, an astrogator from the\nRebel defenses in the Strymon Canals, and there was Aron, who had just\narrived, a space engineer from the Hadriacum front. There were Stein,\nan astrogator, and Wessfeld, an engineer, who had come together in one\ngroundcar from Charax.\n\nThe credentials were all alike, except the names. But one of them\nwas--must be--a Marscorp spy.\n\n\n\nJonner could not check with Sir Stanrich by radio--Mars City was\ntoo close, and they would be overheard. He had no time to spend\ninvestigating his personnel--Sir Stanrich had impressed on him that\ntheir mission must be carried out on schedule.\n\nHe decided he would not tell them just yet that one of them could not\nbe trusted. He might be able to trip the spy. But he said:\n\n\"One or more of us may be killed or captured, so I'm going to brief\neveryone. No matter how many of us are lost, those who are left must\ncarry out the mission. What were you told about this?\"\n\n\"I was told to meet you here and follow your instructions. I was told\nit's a dangerous and important assignment. That's all,\" said Tyruss.\nThe others murmured agreement.\n\n\"The instructions I give you won't be mine, but those of Sir Stanrich\nO'Kellin, supreme commander of the Rebel forces,\" said Jonner. He\nsquatted on the sand and the others crowded around in the blue twilight\nas he sketched diagrams with his gloved hand while he talked:\n\n\"As some of you may have learned, the Charax Rebellion is in danger of\ncollapsing, because our supplies have been running out since Marscorp\nintercepted and destroyed our last space fleet from Earth. Plan Red,\nwhich was our master plan for defeating Marscorp in the field by\ncapturing the dome-cities one by one, has failed. Regina and Charax are\nbeing evacuated because we couldn't hold them much longer anyway, and\nall our people are being transported around the Marscorp territory to\nthe secret underground spaceport we established in the Isidis Desert\ntwo years ago.\n\n\"This is a temporary measure, to prepare for Plan Blue, our last-gasp\nemergency plan. Marscorp will no doubt find the location of the\nunderground base by observation of the refugees, but we hope to\nhave Plan Blue in operation before they can shift their forces from\nHadriacum to the desert and break through our defenses.\"\n\n\"I've heard rumors of this Plan Blue,\" said Farlan, a slight man with\nblond hair. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" conceded Jonner candidly. \"I don't think anyone does\nbut Sir Stanrich and a few of our top strategists. But our part of it\nis this:\n\n\"You may not know it, but we lost our last G-boat when we pulled that\nunsuccessful attack on Phobos early this year. We do have an old\nspaceship, riding in a polar orbit, that Marscorp doesn't know about,\nbut no way to get up to it. Our job is to capture a Marscorp G-boat,\nget to that spaceship, capture The Egg and tow it into an Earthward\norbit.\"\n\n\"The Egg?\" repeated Stein, a dark, chubby fellow. \"You mean that ovoid\nspace station of Marscorp's with the antennae sticking out all over it?\nI've seen that thing floating up there. I always wondered why we didn't\nblast it.\"\n\n\"Not important enough,\" said Jonner. \"It's an experimental laboratory\nthat amplifies the magnetic field of Mars, and they've been\nexperimenting with it as an auxiliary power station. But neither side\nis bothered by any lack of power from the atomic energy sources on\nMars.\"\n\nTyruss appeared annoyed at this.\n\n\"Tell me something, Jonner,\" he demanded. \"If it wasn't important\nenough to blast when we had the ships to do it, why is it important\nenough for us to capture now?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Jonner. \"Those are our orders. Now, we leave the\ngroundcars here and go on foot to Marsport. Check equipment, everyone.\"\n\n\"Say,\" commented Farlan after a moment, \"I don't seem to have any\nsunburn lotion.\"\n\n\"You can have mine,\" said Aron, laughing. \"This far from the sun, I\nhaven't been sunburned yet, and don't expect to be.\"\n\n\"Haven't been on Mars a year yet, have you?\" suggested Tyruss.\n\n\"No,\" admitted Aron. \"I came from Earth with the last space fleet and\nescaped in a lifeboat. Why?\"\n\n\"There's an Earth-sun conjunction coming up. Every time the Earth\nswings between Mars and the sun, everybody on Mars gets a bad sunburn.\nWhen it comes, you better cover yourself with lotion, because clothes\ndon't protect you and even if you're in a city, the domes and house\nroofs are transparent to pick up the sun's heat.\"\n\n\"We have enough among us,\" said Jonner. \"Besides, if our mission goes\noff on schedule, we'll be back at base by the time the Earth-sun\nconjunction starts. Let's head for Marsport.\"\n\n\n\nThe six men crouched in the concealing canal sage near the edge of\nMarsport, the spaceport outside Mars City. The blue mist was a heavy\nfog that swirled around them.\n\nIn the lighted circle of the spaceport area three stubby, two-stage\ngravity-boats sat upright, about a hundred yards apart. These were the\nheavy duty rockets that plied back and forth to Phobos, Mars' inner\nmoon and Marscorp's natural space station, entering the planetary\natmosphere of Mars where spaceships could not go. Workmen stirred\nbusily around one of the G-boats; a guard stood at the entrance port of\neach of the other two.\n\nJonner tried to assess the evidence, to decide which of his five\ncompanions was the Marscorp spy. How Marscorp had found out about the\nexpedition, how the credentials had been forged, how the rendezvous had\nbeen learned, did not matter now. Marscorp could not know their plans\nbeyond the rendezvous in the desert, because only he and Sir Stanrich\nhad known the orders Sir Stanrich had given him for this mission.\n\nThe fact that Stein and Wessfeld had arrived together from Charax\neliminated them as suspects, for the Charax command would have known\nwhether one or two men were to be sent from there.\n\nJonner did not believe Tyruss was the spy. Jonner had won his space\npapers just before the Rebellion began, but it was logical that Sir\nStanrich would send a more experienced space captain to handle their\nship.\n\nThat left Farlan and Aron, from different sections of the Hadriacum\nfront. Which one? In their specialties, Farlan was an alternate to\nStein as an astrogator, Aron an alternate to Wessfeld as an engineer.\nBut every spaceman could handle every other spaceman's duties in an\nemergency, and it was hard to say which task they had decided to double\nup on.\n\nJonner expected the spy to make some move here, tonight, and he had\nprepared for it on the way from the desert. One earphone of his helmet\nreceiver was tuned with his speaker to the Rebel band they used,\nthe other was tuned to the local frequency used by Marscorp. Jonner\nlistened with one ear to the occasional reports and orders that were\npassed around the spaceport.\n\nJonner punched Tyruss, next to him, twice on the shoulder. It was the\nsignal. The six men rose and moved forward together.\n\nThe sentry who loomed before them had no chance. A heat-gun beam is\ninvisible. They cut him down and scurried to the edge of the spaceport,\ninto the circle of light, running in long leaps toward the nearest\nG-boat.\n\nIt was as they broke from the canal sage that the thing happened which\nJonner had expected. The words were shouted into the earphone attuned\nto the Marscorp band: \"Attention, Marscorp! Att....\"\n\nJonner pressed a button on his belt, and his other defense went\ninto action. A scrambler beam cut in on the attempted warning, and\neverything on that channel dissolved into a buzzing roar.\n\nJonner cast a glance down the line of his companions, but they were too\nfar separated for him to see whether any of them was talking into his\nhelmet microphone.\n\nSome of the workmen at the far G-boat saw them running across the\nfield, and scattered in alarm, but the scrambling prevented them from\nwarning others through helmet communicators. The guard at the G-boat\nthat was their goal saw them when they were fifty feet away. He was cut\ndown as he tried to duck around the G-boat.\n\nThey ran up the ramp. Jonner, first to reach the port, stopped and\ntried to watch his companions as they hurried past him. Tyruss was\nfumbling at some control on the belt of his marsuit. His radio channel\ncontrol?\n\nArmed men were converging on the G-boat from all over the field as\nJonner slammed and fastened the port. They scrambled up to the nose of\nthe G-boat, and he and Tyruss sank into the pilots' seats.\n\n\"Strap down for blast-off!\" shouted Jonner, and wished viciously that\nthe spy would still be tuned on the Marscorp band and fail to hear him.\nBut everyone strapped down, hurriedly.\n\nA score of Marscorp soldiers were standing around the G-boat, firing\nup at its ports with heat-guns. The beams were futile, for G-boats\nwere built to stand frictional temperatures it would take a heat-gun\nminutes to build to. Halfway across the field, a squad of men wheeled\nan anti-tank gun into position.\n\nThe gentle gravity of Mars quadrupled as the G-boat strained upward\non roaring jets, gathering speed. Through the port, Jonner saw the\nanti-tank gun's muzzle elevate and blossom flame. There was no impact;\nand there was no opportunity for another shot.\n\nThe G-boat curved eastward in a long ascending arc. The first stage\ndropped off over the Aerian Desert, and in a few moments they were in\nfree fall.\n\n\n\nJonner unstrapped and floated to each man in turn, examining his\ncontrol belt. Farlan's channel dial was a fraction off the band they\nused.\n\n\"Farlan, your radio control's off center,\" said Jonner quietly.\n\n\"What?\" said Farlan's voice, blurred a little. He fumbled at the dial,\nand his words came in clearly. \"Must have hit it against something.\"\n\nOr he could have missed a little when he returned the dial to channel\nafter trying to warn Marscorp. But Tyruss had been fumbling with\nsomething on his belt as they ran onto the G-boat. No, it wouldn't do\nto make an accusation against the wrong man.\n\nAn automatic calendar on the G-boat's control board showed the date:\nupright, the Martian date, Aster 32, 24; reversed, the Earth date,\nJune 1, 2020.\n\nJonner looked down through the port at the inhabited hemisphere of Mars\nunfolding below them. Those green lowlands, those red deserts, now\nwere all in Marscorp hands--even the cradle of the Charax Rebellion,\nthe dome-city of Charax, at the edge of the edge of the Tiphys Fretum\nLowland in the south polar area.\n\nThere, six Martian years ago, the rebellion had flared bravely against\nthe Mars Corporation. Marscorp had held a monopoly on space travel\nbetween Earth and Mars since the first Martian colony was established\nat Mars City in the Earth year 1985. For the supplies Marscorp brought\nfrom Earth, the price was kept high. Marscorp also was the OGM--the\nOfficial Government of Mars, or, as the colonists read the initials,\n\"Old Greedy Marscorp\"--and Marscorp made and enforced the laws.\n\nIt had been a fairly even match at first. Marscorp's initial monopoly\nof the supply lines had been overcome when many of the people on Earth\nwere roused to sympathy for the Rebel cause. Gradually, the Rebels had\ninvested much of the Hadriacum Lowland with its dome-farms and had\ncaptured Regina, another of the planet's six dome-cities.\n\nThat had been before the disastrous space battle of the year 23. Now,\nin the past year, the Rebels had been pushed back to the wall. All that\nwas left to them was Plan Blue. And what was Plan Blue?\n\nJonner looked over his five companions. All helmets were off now, and\nJonner couldn't detect a guilty look in any face. He had never seen\nsuch pure unanimity of apparent innocence and loyalty.\n\n\"Now that we're aspace, we'll go on the customary shifts,\" he said:\n\"eight hours duty, eight hours sleep, eight hours free time. We'll pair\noff: Stein with Farlan, Wessfeld with Aron, Tyruss with me.\n\n\"And these are special orders: no one is to let the man with whom he is\npaired out of his sight.\"\n\nHe would not tell them more than that now; he hoped to trap the spy\nwhen they approached The Egg.\n\n\n\nThe spaceship slid up orbit, overtaking the shining ovoid from which\nantennae sprouted like pins from a pin-cushion. The captured G-boat was\nlashed to the spaceship's side.\n\n\"You'd think they'd have some defenses, anyhow,\" grumbled Tyruss,\nwatching the ovoid on the screen.\n\n\"Why?\" countered Jonner. \"They knew we didn't have any G-boats left,\nand they didn't know we had any spaceships left, either. Of course,\nthey don't know this is our target, but I'll bet they have some ships\nfrom Phobos on the way here now, anyhow.\"\n\nTheir timing was just right. Thirty minutes later The Egg would swing\naround the limb of Mars, in line of sight with Marsport. But so far\nthere had been no chance for The Egg to receive a radio warning of the\nstolen G-boat.\n\nThe spaceship pulled abreast of The Egg and Jonner and Tyruss went\nacross to it in spacesuits. They passed through the airlock to find The\nEgg's crew of three waiting with welcoming smiles. The smiles faded at\nthe sight of their levelled heat-guns.\n\n\"Sorry you weren't expecting us,\" said Jonner, opening the face-plate\nof his spacesuit with his left hand. \"You'll have to get into\nspacesuits.\"\n\nThey sent their captives through the airlock and across the\nintervening space to the spaceship, where the others would be awaiting\nthem. Then Jonner and Tyruss searched The Egg for other Marscorp\npersonnel. They found none.\n\n\"We'd better get a line on her and get under way before those ships\nfrom Phobos can get here,\" said Tyruss.\n\n\"Right,\" agreed Jonner, and they got busy.\n\nA towline secured between the two vessels, Jonner and Tyruss returned\nto the spaceship. The three Marscorp captives had been secured by\nchains to stanchions on the storage deck, just above the engine deck.\nStein and Farlan, the engineers, were standing by.\n\n\"We're getting under way,\" Tyruss told them.\n\nStein and Farlan descended to the engine deck, and Tyruss and Jonner\nclimbed to the control deck. On the centerdeck, Aron and Wessfeld, the\nastrogators, were asleep.\n\nTyruss climbed into the control chair and switched the radio to the\nMarscorp band. A voice blared from the communicator:\n\n\"Marscorp calling The Egg. Marscorp calling The Egg. Come in, Egg. Can\nyou hear us, Egg? Rebels captured G-boat here. Double alert. Marscorp\ncalling....\"\n\nTyruss switched it off, laughing.\n\n\"A little late,\" he commented.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jonner. \"Keep the receiver on that band, Tyruss, because we\nwon't be hearing from our side. But, until we finish our mission, I'm\ngoing to disconnect the sending equipment.\"\n\nJonner floated to the other side of the control deck and moved around\nbehind the control board. He was busy disconnecting wires, a few\nminutes later, when he heard an exclamation from Tyruss.\n\nHe peeked around the edge of the control board. The three Marscorp\ncaptives were floating up the companionway from below, heat-guns in\ntheir hands!\n\n\"Keep your hands off those controls, Reb,\" warned one of them. \"This\nship's staying right here.\"\n\n\"Wasn't there another one in this gang, Robbo?\" asked another.\n\nTyruss twisted in his chair and reached for his heat-gun. One of the\nMarscorp men rayed him through the throat.\n\nCautiously, Jonner poked the muzzle of his heat-gun around the edge\nof the control board. Methodically, he shot the three Marscorp men,\none by one. They died without discovering the source of the invisible\nheat-beam that cut them down.\n\nTyruss was dead. Cursing, Jonner went below, heat-gun in hand. On the\ncenterdeck, Wessfeld's body floated. Wessfeld was dead, burned through\nthe chest. Aron was not there.\n\nHe found all three of the others, locked in the airlock, without\nspacesuits. Jonner watched Aron suspiciously as they emerged.\n\n\"What happened?\" he demanded of Aron.\n\n\"I don't know,\" disclaimed Aron. \"They woke us up. They had heat-guns\nthen. Wessfeld tried to reach his, and they shot him. Stein and Farlan\nwere already in the airlock when they brought me down.\"\n\n\"Stein, were you and Farlan constantly in sight of each other,\nas ordered?\" asked Jonner, watching Aron. Did Aron's eyes widen\napprehensively?\n\nStein started.\n\n\"Why, no,\" he admitted. \"Farlan was on the engine deck, and I was\ndown in the airlock checking the spacesuits before blast-off. That's\nroutine, you know. They herded Farlan down and caught me by surprise.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said Farlan. \"I was checking the engines when they came\nthrough the hatch from above with heat-guns.\"\n\n\"Damn!\" exploded Jonner. \"I gave everyone strict orders--all right,\nit's too late now. It just cost us two men, and one of the four of\nus left is a Marscorp spy. Everyone get above and strap down for\nacceleration.\"\n\nThe spy was Aron or Farlan, but he still didn't know which. Aron could\nhave feigned sleep, and slipped down to the storage deck to release\nand arm the Marscorp men. Or Farlan could have climbed from the engine\ndeck and done it while Stein was in the airlock. Whoever it was, he had\nchosen to be locked in with the others--probably in case the sortie\nfailed.\n\nNow they were two men short, and still he would have to pair off with\nAron and pair Stein with Farlan. They would have to go on twelve-hour\nduty shifts, with only four hours free time.\n\nAnd to what purpose? As Tyruss had suggested several times, why\ncouldn't they have just blasted The Egg out of space, if the purpose\nwas to get rid of it? Why go to all the trouble of shifting it to an\nEarthward orbit? The Earth would be nowhere near the intersection point\nwhen The Egg reached Earth's orbit, if that made any difference.\n\nJonner had at last let the others know, as he should have before, that\none of them was a spy. But he would not tell them, as he had told\nTyruss, that he had disconnected the radio transmitter. Let the spy try\nto get in touch with Marscorp now!\n\n\n\n\"Jonner,\" said Aron, \"there are a couple of blips on the radar screen\nthat shouldn't be there.\"\n\nJonner swung the control chair to look at the screen. There were two\ndots there, almost directly to the rear of the spaceship. Jonner\nwatched them. They held their position on the screen.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said. \"Pretty large for meteors, and there doesn't\nseem to be any lateral movement.\"\n\nTheir ship had just begun acceleration, following a hyperbola that\nwould break them free of Mars' gravity. It was a hyperbola that swung\nthe ship against the direction of the planet's orbital travel, and,\nwhile speeding the ship away from the planet, slowed it in relation to\nthe sun.\n\nJonner and Aron were on duty on the control deck. Stein and Farlan\nslept on the centerdeck below. Two 24-hour periods had passed since\nthey captured The Egg and maneuvered it into the right orbit for their\ndeparture from the Martian area.\n\nThe blips grew on the screen, and still they did not move laterally.\n\n\"Spaceships,\" Jonner decided.\n\n\"They're following our course, and overtaking us.\"\n\n\"Marscorp ships!\" exclaimed Aron. \"But Jonner, we never were in radar\nrange of any Marscorp ship or installation. How could they know our\nposition and course?\"\n\nWithout replying, Jonner arose from the control chair and went around\nbehind the control board. The wires to the radio transmitter, which he\nhad disconnected so carefully, had been reconnected.\n\n\"Aron,\" said Jonner, coming back to the control chair, \"go down and\nchain Farlan to his bunk. He's our Marscorp spy.\"\n\n\"He is?\" Aron's eyes widened. \"How do you know?\"\n\n\"Because you haven't been out of my sight since we took The Egg in tow,\nand you haven't been near that control board while we were on duty.\nStein must have let Farlan get away from him again.\"\n\n\"Why not Stein?\"\n\n\"You forget. Stein and Wessfeld arrived together from Charax, at the\nrendezvous. They had to be clean.\"\n\nAron unstrapped and arose.\n\n\"Shouldn't we boost acceleration and try to evade them?\" he asked,\ngesturing at the radar screen.\n\n\"We can't now,\" said Jonner. \"We're on an escape hyperbola and we've\ngot to hold this acceleration until she runs out, or we'd throw it\ncompletely off.\"\n\nAron went below. Jonner watched the screen anxiously. The Marscorp\nships must have set an interception course, for their acceleration was\nmuch too high to be following their own escape orbit. They were getting\ncloser rapidly.\n\nJonner looked at the chronometer and at the tape still ticking through\nthe ship's control mechanism. Eleven minutes was a brief time, but\nit seemed long when enemy ships were overtaking them at twice their\nacceleration.\n\nTowing The Egg, this old ship could not match the Marscorp attackers'\nacceleration. It could accelerate much faster than it was, but if he\nwas to hit the Earthward orbit he had been ordered to take he would\nhave to hold his present acceleration until the eleven minutes was up.\n\nAnd the Marscorp ships got closer by the minute.\n\n\n\nAron climbed back to the control deck from below.\n\n\"Farlan's tied up, and he's madder than hell,\" Aron reported. \"Stein\nsaid Farlan _did_ go behind the control board on their last duty\nstretch, to 'adjust' the radio. What's the situation now?\"\n\n\"They've started decelerating to match our pace when they get abreast\nof us,\" said Jonner, indicating the rocket flares that now appeared on\nthe aft visual screen.\n\nThe tape suddenly ran out, and the rockets' roar faded. They were in\nfree fall again.\n\n\"Get into a spacesuit and cut that towline,\" commanded Jonner. \"We're\ngoing to make a run for it.\"\n\n\"We're not going to stay and guard The Egg?\" asked Aron, getting a suit\noff one of the hooks.\n\n\"No outside guns. This hulk was a supply ship. As soon as you get\nback in and secure the outer airlock, holler and we'll start partial\nacceleration. When you've strapped down somewhere below, holler again\nand we'll blow the tubes.\"\n\nWhile Aron went below to carry out his assignment, Jonner swung the\nship end-to with the gyroscopes. He prayed silently that the towline\nto The Egg wouldn't foul. They'd have to head back toward Mars, for\nfurther acceleration in this direction would throw them, helpless, in a\npath toward outer space.\n\nThe radio loudspeaker boomed:\n\n\"OGM ship Phobos-29 to Rebel spaceship. Stand by for boarding or get\nblasted.\"\n\nThe Marscorp ships were within a few miles now, slowing to match the\npace of the Rebel ship.\n\nThe outer airlock warning light flashed red, then green again.\n\n\"Ready!\" said Aron's voice on the ship's communicator.\n\nJonner flicked his radio transmitter to the Marscorp beam.\n\n\"Go to hell!\" he announced, and depressed the firing buttons.\n\nIt was uncomfortable for Aron, climbing out of the airlock, but Jonner\nthrew the ship into a full G acceleration. The Marscorp ships loomed\nsuddenly to each side, then faded behind them. A few futile flashes of\ngunfire blossomed from their noses. Then rings of fire appeared behind\nthem as they gave chase.\n\n\"Strapped down!\" called Aron, and Jonner gave the rockets full blast.\n\nThe ship leaped like a frantic old war-horse. Jonner was pressed down\nheavily in his control chair. Its beams and plates groaned as G was\npiled on G.\n\nThe Egg was gone from the rearward screens, released and floating free\nin an Earthward orbit. The Marscorp ships fell farther behind. Then\nthey stopped receding and began to grow on the screens again. Newer and\nmore powerful, they were overtaking the Rebel ship.\n\nSuddenly the ship's rockets ceased firing again, and they were in free\nfall. A moment later, Aron popped up from below.\n\n\"Are we hit?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, they aren't back in range yet,\" answered Jonner. \"We're out of\nfuel. Maybe it's just as well they came along, because I don't believe\nthis clunk had enough fuel to overtake Mars again, even if we hadn't\nblown it in that escape try.\"\n\nThe Marscorp attackers apparently interpreted the Rebel ship's dead\nrocket tubes as a surrender. Within half an hour they had drawn\nalongside, and armed men in spacesuits came through the airlock. Farlan\nwas freed of his chains, and Jonner, Stein and Aron were herded onto\nthe centerdeck of one of the Marscorp ships and secured to stanchions.\n\nThe Marscorp captain floated before them, looking them over quizzically.\n\n\"I don't know what you fellows were trying to prove, but you're lucky,\"\nhe said. \"If you hadn't cut your rockets when you did, we'd have\nblasted you out of space.\"\n\nJonner answered out of the knowledge that no ships which had\naccelerated as these two had in the past hour would have more than\nenough fuel left to get them back to Phobos. The Egg, trailing far\nbehind Mars now, would overtake the planet gradually as the pull of the\nsun sped it up, but it would pass Mars well to sunward in its plunge\ntoward the orbit of Earth. Any ship that tried to intercept it from\nMars now would fight increasing solar gravity and would run the risk of\nnot getting back to Mars.\n\n\"Well, we accomplished our mission, anyhow,\" Jonner said resignedly,\n\"for whatever it's worth.\"\n\n\"A fool's mission,\" said the Marscorp captain, and Jonner was inclined\nto agree with him. \"The Egg was an experimental laboratory and an\nauxiliary power station, and we can build another cheaper than we could\nrecover it. As for you fellows, you're better off than you realize.\"\n\n\"How's that?\" asked Stein.\n\n\"Why, if you aren't tried as war criminals, you ought to be freed\npretty quickly. According to the latest news reports from Mars City,\nour armies are driving your people back into your underground base in\nthe Isidis Desert. The war will be over as soon as we've cracked that.\"\n\n\n\nJonner, Stein and Aron lay around in the Marscorp brig on Phobos for\nmore than a month. To be precise, they floated around, for Phobos had\nlittle more surface gravity than a spaceship in orbit. When there was\nno indication they were going to be transferred from Phobos, Jonner\nset up a howl that at last was heard in the little moon's officialdom.\n\nJonner was taken before the adjutant of the Phobos base to air his\ncomplaint.\n\n\"Look,\" said Jonner, placing both hands belligerently on the official's\ndesk, \"the terms of the terrestrial Space Compact apply to Mars, too.\nNo prisoners of war shall be confined beyond a planetary atmosphere,\nexcept for so long as it is impracticable for them to be transferred to\na surface prison.\"\n\n\"That provision was written into the compact to permit inspection by\nneutral powers and because, ordinarily, a prisoner has some hope that\na surface prison will be overrun by troops of his own side and he will\nbe released,\" answered the adjutant mildly, peering at Jonner over\nold-fashioned rimless spectacles. \"In your case, that's not likely to\nhappen and I can't see why you're raising such a fuss. The last we\nheard up here, our troops were about to overrun your last base.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, the last you heard?\" demanded Jonner. \"I heard that\ntwo days before we were brought to Phobos.\"\n\n\"Radio communication with Mars has been out completely,\" explained the\nadjutant good-naturedly. \"Static's always bad during the Earth-sun\nconjunctions, as you ought to know, being a spaceman. This time we\nhaven't been able to get anything through at all.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe it's true that we've lost and the war's about over,\"\nsaid Jonner. \"But the three of us still want to be transferred to the\nsurface. Free fall can drive you nuts when you're in an eight-by-eight\ncell.\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact,\" said the adjutant, \"there hasn't been any\nG-boat traffic to and from the surface since the radio went out. It's\na dangerous business, trying to land at a spaceport without any radio\nguide. But we have to send a G-boat down for supplies in a couple of\ndays, and if you fellows are insistent about it, we'll send you down to\nMarsport on it.\"\n\nIt was not two days, but more than a week later that the three of them\nwere allowed to get into spacesuits and were escorted out to a G-boat\nanchored to the surface of Phobos.\n\nAbove them, the orange disc of Mars filled the sky. Phobos was swinging\nacross the inhabited hemisphere now, and the dark green areas of Syrtis\nand Hadriacum were plainly visible.\n\nJonner strained his eyes upward at the red spot that was the Isidis\nDesert. Somewhere in the heart of that red spot, Sir Stanrich O'Kellin\nwas directing the last-gasp stand of the Charax Rebels. They would be\nmanning the underground chambers of the base, perhaps fighting in the\ncorridors as the Marscorp troops battled to effect an entry.\n\nIt might even be that the base had fallen by now, overrun by the\ngovernment forces, and he and his companions would be, technically,\nfree men by the time they landed at Marsport. Jonner sighed unhappily.\nHe didn't want that kind of freedom.\n\nFollowing Stein and Aron, he climbed into the G-boat. It had a crew of\ntwo, plus an armed guard for the prisoners.\n\n\"There'll be no unstrapping during free fall,\" announced the G-boat\npilot. \"Everybody will remain strapped down until we land. With the\nEarth-sun conjunction over, we've re-established radio communication\npartially, but it's spotty, and we may crash.\"\n\n\"Is the war over?\" asked Jonner.\n\n\"How the hell should I know?\" grunted the pilot. \"We haven't had a\nsingle news broadcast that makes sense since the radio came back in.\nThey're all chopped up with static.\"\n\nThe G-boat lifted gently from the surface of Phobos and began its\nspiral downward toward Mars. The six men, crowded together in its\nsingle passenger compartment, listened to the radio that spat and\ngrowled over their heads.\n\nWhat they heard was unintelligible.\n\n\"Sector Four ... squawk ... spsst!\" snarled the loudspeaker.\n\"Colonel ... squawk ... troops in ... squawk ... move tank squad\nto ... spsst-crack-crack!... more ambulances ... squawk ... ninety\nper cent disabled....\"\n\nPeriodically the pilot tried to establish contact:\n\n\"G-boat MC-20 to Marsport. G-boat MC-20 to Marsport. Come in, Marsport.\"\n\nThe attempts were futile until the G-boat had entered the atmosphere\nand was gliding high above the desert on its broad wings. Then,\nmiraculously, the airwaves were clear for a moment.\n\n\"Marsport to G-boat MC-20,\" said the loudspeaker. \"Go ahead.\"\n\n\"G-boat MC-20 to Marsport,\" said the pilot hurriedly. \"Give us a beam.\nWe're coming in for a landing.\"\n\n\"Don't land! We're...!\" exclaimed the loudspeaker, and exploded into\nstatic in midsentence.\n\n\"What the hell do they mean, don't land?\" snorted the pilot, fiddling\nfrantically and uselessly with dials. \"They think I've got enough fuel\nto get back to Phobos?\"\n\nThe G-boat held its glide and swooped down on Marsport, a tiny landing\nfield and a miniature group of buildings set apart from the dome of\nMars City. Groups of men were scurrying about at the port like ants. A\ncolumn of smoke rose ominously from one of the buildings.\n\nThe G-boat touched ground and skidded to a stop in mid-field. Its\npassengers unstrapped and the pilot opened the port.\n\nMen crowded into the G-boat, men with drawn heat-guns, men in the\nblue-and-gold marsuits of the Charax Rebels!\n\n\n\nJonner, a free man again, rode into Mars City in a groundcar with Sir\nStanrich O'Kellin. Stein and Aron had remained at Marsport for the time\nbeing. Marsport was completely in the hands of the Rebels, and efforts\nwere being made to get through by radio to Phobos to give the Marscorp\nforces there a surrender ultimatum.\n\n\"What's happened to the Mars City dome?\" asked Jonner in astonishment\nas they approached the city. The once-transparent dome was cracked and\nbadly discolored.\n\n\"Plan Blue,\" answered Sir Stanrich with a smile.\n\n\"Look, sir, how about telling me what happened?\" said Jonner. \"When we\ngot captured in the middle of our wild goose chase with Marscorp's Egg,\nour troops had been driven into the ground at the Isidis base and we\ngot the impression it was only a matter of time before that fell. Then\nthe radio goes out for a few days and we land here to find Mars City\noverrun with our troops.\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Sir Stanrich, his mustache quirking mischievously, \"we\ncounter-attacked. We came out of the base, defeated the Marscorp army\nthere, drove across the desert to Mars City and took it. Task forces\nare out now, taking over the other cities. That's all there is to it.\"\n\n\"Simple!\" snorted Jonner. \"Except that they outnumbered us four or five\nto one, and probably outgunned us more than that.\"\n\n\"Science wins wars now; my boy, not numbers and guns.\"\n\nThey had entered the Mars City airlock and were driving down the broad\nAvenue of the Canals. Rebel soldiers swarmed through the city. The few\nmen and women they saw in Marscorp uniforms staggered around, groping\nblindly, their faces and arms fiery red and peeling from sunburn.\n\n\"You'll get a medal out of it, too,\" commented Sir Stanrich.\n\n\"Why? Why me?\"\n\n\"Because you followed orders, even though your mission appeared\nuseless. It was your 'wild goose chase' that made our victory possible.\n\n\"You see, only the blue mist of Mars protects its surface from the hard\nrays of the sun. Without it, we'd have no more protection than a naked\nman in space. The reason we're in for a bad sunburn every year is that\nthe blue mist dissipates partially at every Earth-sun conjunction.\"\n\n\"But what would The Egg have to do with that?\" asked Jonner.\n\n\"The Egg amplifies the effect of magnetic fields, the way a lens\nconcentrates light rays,\" answered Sir Stanrich. \"It's the Earth's\nmagnetic field, not that of Mars, that interferes with the blue mist\nevery time the Earth passes between Mars and the sun. And to amplify\nEarth's magnetic field, we had to place The Egg directly between Mars\nand Earth during the Earth-sun conjunction--and you put it there when\nyou got the Egg into an Earthward orbit on schedule.\"\n\n\"But, Sir Stanrich, I've been sunburned a dozen times at these\nconjunctions....\"\n\n\"Not like this. When the blue mist was stripped away completely this\ntime, everyone on the surface was affected. Marscorp's troops were\nput out of action as an effective fighting force when they received\nsevere burns over most of their bodies and were afflicted with acute\nconjunctivitis so badly they were half blinded. That's why we abandoned\nCharax and Regina and pulled all our people to the Isidis base while\nthe conjunction was under way, we were all protected from the sun ...\nunderground!\"\n\nThey had reached the center of the city. Above the old Syrtis Major\nHotel, which had served as Marscorp's supreme headquarters, the flag\nof the Charax Rebels was fluttering in the breeze from the city's air\ncirculators.\n\nMarscorp was beaten. Mars was free.",
