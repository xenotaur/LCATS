    "body": "by\n\nH. BEAM PIPER\n\n\nFor a moment, after the screen door snapped and wakened him, Lee\nRichardson sat breathless and motionless, his eyes still closed, trying\ndesperately to cling to the dream and print it upon his conscious memory\nbefore it faded.\n\n\"Are you there, Lee?\" he heard Alexis Pitov's voice.\n\n\"Yes, I'm here. What time is it?\" he asked, and then added, \"I fell\nasleep. I was dreaming.\"\n\nIt was all right; he was going to be able to remember. He could still\nsee the slim woman with the graying blonde hair, playing with the little\ndachshund among the new-fallen leaves on the lawn. He was glad they'd\nboth been in this dream together; these dream-glimpses were all he'd had\nfor the last fifteen years, and they were too precious to lose. He\nopened his eyes. The Russian was sitting just outside the light from the\nopen door of the bungalow, lighting a cigarette. For a moment, he could\nsee the blocky, high-cheeked face, now pouched and wrinkled, and then\nthe flame went out and there was only the red coal glowing in the\ndarkness. He closed his eyes again, and the dream picture came back to\nhim, the woman catching the little dog and raising her head as though to\nspeak to him.\n\n\"Plenty of time, yet.\" Pitov was speaking German instead of Spanish, as\nthey always did between themselves. \"They're still counting down from\nminus three hours. I just phoned the launching site for a jeep.\nEugenio's been there ever since dinner; they say he's running around\nlike a cat looking for a place to have her first litter of kittens.\"\n\nHe chuckled. This would be something new for Eugenio Galvez--for which\nhe could be thankful.\n\n\"I hope the generators don't develop any last-second bugs,\" he said.\n\"We'll only be a mile and a half away, and that'll be too close to fifty\nkilos of negamatter if the field collapses.\"\n\n\"It'll be all right,\" Pitov assured him. \"The bugs have all been chased\nout years ago.\"\n\n\"Not out of those generators in the rocket. They're new.\" He fumbled in\nhis coat pocket for his pipe and tobacco. \"I never thought I'd run\nanother nuclear-bomb test, as long as I lived.\"\n\n\"Lee!\" Pitov was shocked. \"You mustn't call it that. It isn't that, at\nall. It's purely a scientific experiment.\"\n\n\"Wasn't that all any of them were? We made lots of experiments like\nthis, back before 1969.\" The memories of all those other tests, each\nending in an Everest-high mushroom column, rose in his mind. And the end\nresult--the United States and the Soviet Union blasted to rubble, a\nwhole hemisphere pushed back into the Dark Ages, a quarter of a billion\ndead. Including a slim woman with graying blonde hair, and a little red\ndog, and a girl from Odessa whom Alexis Pitov had been going to marry.\n\"Forgive me, Alexis. I just couldn't help remembering. I suppose it's\nthis shot we're going to make, tonight. It's so much like the other\nones, before--\" He hesitated slightly. \"Before the Auburn Bomb.\"\n\nThere; he'd come out and said it. In all the years they'd worked\ntogether at the _Instituto Argentino de Ciencia Fisica_, that had been\nunmentioned between them. The families of hanged cutthroats avoid\nmention of ropes and knives. He thumbed the old-fashioned American\nlighter and held it to his pipe. Across the veranda, in the darkness, he\nknew that Pitov was looking intently at him.\n\n\"You've been thinking about that, lately, haven't you?\" the Russian\nasked, and then, timidly: \"Was that what you were dreaming of?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, thank heaven!\"\n\n\"I think about it, too, always. I suppose--\" He seemed relieved, now\nthat it had been brought out into the open and could be discussed. \"You\nsaw it fall, didn't you?\"\n\n\"That's right. From about thirty miles away. A little closer than we'll\nbe to this shot, tonight. I was in charge of the investigation at\nAuburn, until we had New York and Washington and Detroit and Mobile and\nSan Francisco to worry about. Then what had happened to Auburn wasn't\nimportant, any more. We were trying to get evidence to lay before the\nUnited Nations. We kept at it for about twelve hours after the United\nNations had ceased to exist.\"\n\n\"I could never understand about that, Lee. I don't know what the truth\nis; I probably never shall. But I know that my government did not launch\nthat missile. During the first days after yours began coming in, I\ntalked to people who had been in the Kremlin at the time. One had been\nin the presence of Klyzenko himself when the news of your bombardment\narrived. He said that Klyzenko was absolutely stunned. We always\nbelieved that your government decided upon a preventive surprise attack,\nand picked out a town, Auburn, New York, that had been hit by one of our\nfirst retaliation missiles, and claimed that it had been hit first.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"Auburn was hit an hour before the first American\nmissile was launched. I know that to be a fact. We could never\nunderstand why you launched just that one, and no more until after ours\nbegan landing on you; why you threw away the advantage of surprise and\npriority of attack--\"\n\n\"Because we didn't do it, Lee!\" The Russian's voice trembled with\nearnestness. \"You believe me when I tell you that?\"\n\n\"Yes, I believe you. After all that happened, and all that you, and I,\nand the people you worked with, and the people I worked with, and your\ngovernment, and mine, have been guilty of, it would be a waste of breath\nfor either of us to try to lie to the other about what happened fifteen\nyears ago.\" He drew slowly on his pipe. \"But who launched it, then? It\nhad to be launched by somebody.\"\n\n\"Don't you think I've been tormenting myself with that question for the\nlast fifteen years?\" Pitov demanded. \"You know, there were people inside\nthe Soviet Union--not many, and they kept themselves well hidden--who\nwere dedicated to the overthrow of the Soviet regime. They, or some of\nthem, might have thought that the devastation of both our countries, and\nthe obliteration of civilization in the Northern Hemisphere, would be a\ncheap price to pay for ending the rule of the Communist Party.\"\n\n\"Could they have built an ICBM with a thermonuclear warhead in secret?\"\nhe asked. \"There were also fanatical nationalist groups in Europe, both\nsides of the Iron Curtain, who might have thought our mutual destruction\nwould be worth the risks involved.\"\n\n\"There was China, and India. If your country and mine wiped each other\nout, they could go back to the old ways and the old traditions. Or\nJapan, or the Moslem States. In the end, they all went down along with\nus, but what criminal ever expects to fall?\"\n\n\"We have too many suspects, and the trail's too cold, Alexis. That\nrocket wouldn't have had to have been launched anywhere in the Northern\nHemisphere. For instance, our friends here in the Argentine have been\ndoing very well by themselves since _El Coloso del Norte_ went down.\"\n\nAnd there were the Australians, picking themselves up bargains in\nreal-estate in the East Indies at gun-point, and there were the Boers,\ntrekking north again, in tanks instead of ox-wagons. And Brazil, with a\nnot-too-implausible pretender to the Braganza throne, calling itself the\nPortuguese Empire and looking eastward. And, to complete the picture,\nhere were Professor Doctor Lee Richardson and Comrade Professor Alexis\nPetrovitch Pitov, getting ready to test a missile with a\nmatter-annihilation warhead.\n\nNo. This thing just wasn't a weapon.\n\nA jeep came around the corner, lighting the dark roadway between the\nbungalows, its radio on and counting down--_Twenty two minutes. Twenty\none fifty nine, fifty eight, fifty seven_--It came to a stop in front of\ntheir bungalow, at exactly Minus Two Hours, Twenty One Minutes, Fifty\nFour Seconds. The driver called out in Spanish:\n\n\"Doctor Richardson; Doctor Pitov! Are you ready?\"\n\n\"Yes, ready. We're coming.\"\n\nThey both got to their feet, Richardson pulling himself up reluctantly.\nThe older you get, the harder it is to leave a comfortable chair. He\nsettled himself beside his colleague and former enemy, and the jeep\nstarted again, rolling between the buildings of the living-quarters area\nand out onto the long, straight road across the pampas toward the\ndistant blaze of electric lights.\n\nHe wondered why he had been thinking so much, lately, about the Auburn\nBomb. He'd questioned, at times, indignantly, of course, whether Russia\nhad launched it--but it wasn't until tonight, until he had heard what\nPitov had had to say, that he seriously doubted it. Pitov wouldn't lie\nabout it, and Pitov would have been in a position to have known the\ntruth, if the missile had been launched from Russia. Then he stopped\nthinking about what was water--or blood--a long time over the dam.\n\nThe special policeman at the entrance to the launching site reminded\nthem that they were both smoking; when they extinguished, respectively,\ntheir cigarette and pipe, he waved the jeep on and went back to his\nargument with a carload of tourists who wanted to get a good view of the\nlaunching.\n\n\"There, now, Lee; do you need anything else to convince you that this\nisn't a weapon project?\" Pitov asked.\n\n\"No, now that you mention it. I don't. You know, I don't believe I've\nhad to show an identity card the whole time I've been here.\"\n\n\"I don't believe I have an identity card,\" Pitov said. \"Think of that.\"\n\nThe lights blazed everywhere around them, but mostly about the rocket\nthat towered above everything else, so thick that it seemed squat. The\ngantry-cranes had been hauled away, now, and it stood alone, but it was\nstill wreathed in thick electric cables. They were pouring enough\ncurrent into that thing to light half the street-lights in Buenos Aires;\nwhen the cables were blown free by separation charges at the blastoff,\nthe generators powered by the rocket-engines had better be able to take\nover, because if the magnetic field collapsed and that fifty-kilo chunk\nof negative-proton matter came in contact with natural positive-proton\nmatter, an old-fashioned H-bomb would be a firecracker to what would\nhappen. Just one hundred kilos of pure, two-hundred proof MC2.\n\nThe driver took them around the rocket, dodging assorted trucks and\nmobile machinery that were being hurried out of the way. The countdown\nwas just beyond two hours five minutes. The jeep stopped at the edge of\na crowd around three more trucks, and Doctor Eugenio Galvez, the\ndirector of the Institute, left the crowd and approached at an awkward\nhalf-run as they got down.\n\n\"Is everything checked, gentlemen?\" he wanted to know.\n\n\"It was this afternoon at 1730,\" Pitov told him. \"And nobody's been\nburning my telephone to report anything different. Are the balloons and\nthe drone planes ready?\"\n\n\"The Air Force just finished checking; they're ready. Captain Urquiola\nflew one of the planes over the course and made a guidance-tape; that's\nbeen duplicated and all the planes are equipped with copies.\"\n\n\"How's the wind?\" Richardson asked.\n\n\"Still steady. We won't have any trouble about fallout or with the\nballoons.\"\n\n\"Then we'd better go back to the bunker and make sure everybody there is\non the job.\"\n\nThe loudspeaker was counting down to Two Hours One Minute.\n\n\"Could you spare a few minutes to talk to the press?\" Eugenio Galvez\nasked. \"And perhaps say a few words for telecast? This last is most\nimportant; we can't explain too many times the purpose of this\nexperiment. There is still much hostility, arising from fear that we are\ntesting a nuclear weapon.\"\n\nThe press and telecast services were well represented; there were close\nto a hundred correspondents, from all over South America, from South\nAfrica and Australia, even one from Ceylon. They had three trucks, with\nmobile telecast pickups, and when they saw who was approaching, they\nreleased the two rocketry experts they had been quizzing and pounced on\nthe new victims.\n\nWas there any possibility that negative-proton matter might be used as a\nweapon?\n\n\"Anything can be used as a weapon; you could stab a man to death with\nthat lead pencil you're using,\" Pitov replied. \"But I doubt if\nnegamatter will ever be so used. We're certainly not working on weapons\ndesign here. We started, six years ago, with the ability to produce\nnegative protons, reverse-spin neutrons, and positrons, and the\ntheoretical possibility of assembling them into negamatter. We have just\ngotten a fifty kilogramme mass of nega-iron assembled. In those six\nyears, we had to invent all our techniques, and design all our\nequipment. If we'd been insane enough to want to build a nuclear weapon,\nafter what we went through up North, we could have done so from memory,\nand designed a better--which is to say a worse--one from memory in a few\ndays.\"\n\n\"Yes, and building a negamatter bomb for military purposes would be like\ndigging a fifty foot shaft to get a rock to bash somebody's head in,\nwhen you could do the job better with the shovel you're digging with,\"\nRichardson added. \"The time, money, energy and work we put in on this\nthing would be ample to construct twenty thermonuclear bombs. And that's\nonly a small part of it.\" He went on to tell them about the magnetic\nbottle inside the rocket's warhead, mentioning how much electric current\nwas needed to keep up the magnetic field that insulated the negamatter\nfrom contact with posimatter.\n\n\"Then what was the purpose of this experiment, Doctor Richardson?\"\n\n\"Oh, we were just trying to find out a few basic facts about natural\nstructure. Long ago, it was realized that the nucleonic\nparticles--protons, neutrons, mesons and so on--must have structure of\ntheir own. Since we started constructing negative-proton matter, we've\nfound out a few things about nucleonic structure. Some rather odd\nthings, including fractions of Planck's constant.\"\n\nA couple of the correspondents--a man from La Prensa, and an\nAustralian--whistled softly. The others looked blank. Pitov took over:\n\n\"You see, gentlemen, most of what we learned, we learned from putting\nnegamatter atoms together. We annihilated a few of them--over there in\nthat little concrete building, we have one of the most massive steel\nvaults in the world, where we do that--but we assembled millions of them\nfor every one we annihilated, and that chunk of nega-iron inside the\nmagnetic bottle kept growing. And when you have a piece of negamatter\nyou don't want, you can't just throw it out on the scrap-pile. We might\nhave rocketed it into escape velocity and let it blow up in space, away\nfrom the Moon or any of the artificial satellites, but why waste it? So\nwe're going to have the rocket eject it, and when it falls, we can see,\nby our telemetered instruments, just what happens.\"\n\n\"Well, won't it be annihilated by contact with atmosphere?\" somebody\nasked.\n\n\"That's one of the things we want to find out,\" Pitov said. \"We estimate\nabout twenty percent loss from contact with atmosphere, but the mass\nthat actually lands on the target area should be about forty kilos. It\nshould be something of a spectacle, coming down.\"\n\n\"You say you had to assemble it, after creating the negative protons and\nneutrons and the positrons. Doesn't any of this sort of matter exist in\nnature?\"\n\nThe man who asked that knew better himself. He just wanted the answer on\nthe record.\n\n\"Oh no; not on this planet, and probably not in the Galaxy. There may be\nwhole galaxies composed of nothing but negamatter. There may even be\nisolated stars and planetary systems inside our Galaxy composed of\nnegamatter, though I think that very improbable. But when negamatter and\nposimatter come into contact with one another, the result is immediate\nmutual annihilation.\"\n\nThey managed to get away from the press, and returned as far as the\nbunkers, a mile and a half away. Before they went inside, Richardson\nglanced up at the sky, fixing the location of a few of the more\nconspicuous stars in his mind. There were almost a hundred men and women\ninside, each at his or her instruments--view-screens, radar indicators,\ndetection instruments of a dozen kinds. The reporters and telecast\npeople arrived shortly afterward, and Eugenio Galvez took them in tow.\nWhile Richardson and Pitov were making their last-minute rounds, the\ncountdown progressed past minus one hour, and at minus twenty minutes\nall the overhead lights went off and the small instrument operators'\nlights came on.\n\nPitov turned on a couple of view-screens, one from a pickup on the roof\nof the bunker and another from the launching-pad. They sat down side by\nside and waited. Richardson got his pipe out and began loading it. The\nloudspeaker was saying: \"_Minus two minutes, one fifty nine, fifty\neight, fifty seven_--\"\n\nHe let his mind drift away from the test, back to the world that had\nbeen smashed around his ears in the autumn of 1969. He was doing that so\noften, now, when he should be thinking about--\n\n\"_Two seconds, one second_. FIRING!\"\n\nIt was a second later that his eyes focussed on the left hand\nview-screen. Red and yellow flames were gushing out at the bottom of the\nrocket, and it was beginning to tremble. Then the upper jets, the ones\nthat furnished power for the generators, began firing. He looked\nanxiously at the meters; the generators were building up power. Finally,\nwhen he was sure that the rocket would be blasting off anyhow, the\nseparator-charges fired and the heavy cables fell away. An instant\nlater, the big missile started inching upward, gaining speed by the\nsecond, first slowly and jerkily and then more rapidly, until it passed\nout of the field of the pickup. He watched the rising spout of fire from\nthe other screen until it passed from sight.\n\nBy that time, Pitov had twisted a dial and gotten another view on the\nleft hand screen, this time from close to the target. That camera was\nradar-controlled; it had fastened onto the approaching missile, which\nwas still invisible. The stars swung slowly across the screen until\nRichardson recognized the ones he had spotted at the zenith. In a\nmoment, now, the rocket, a hundred miles overhead, would be nosing down,\nand then the warhead would open and the magnetic field inside would\nalter and the mass of negamatter would be ejected.\n\nThe stars were blotted out by a sudden glow of light. Even at a hundred\nmiles, there was enough atmospheric density to produce considerable\nenergy release. Pitov, beside him, was muttering, partly in German and\npartly in Russian; most of what Richardson caught was figures. Trying to\ncalculate how much of the mass of unnatural iron would get down for the\nground blast. Then the right hand screen broke into a wriggling orgy of\ncolor, and at the same time every scrap of radio-transmitted apparatus\neither went out or began reporting erratically. The left hand screen,\nconnected by wiring to the pickup on the roof, was still functioning.\nFor a moment, Richardson wondered what was going on, and then shocked\nrecognition drove that from his mind as he stared at the\never-brightening glare in the sky.\n\nIt was the Auburn Bomb again! He was back, in memory, to the night on\nthe shore of Lake Ontario; the party breaking up in the early hours of\nmorning; he and Janet and the people with whom they had been spending a\nvacation week standing on the lawn as the guests were getting into their\ncars. And then the sudden light in the sky. The cries of surprise, and\nthen of alarm as it seemed to be rushing straight down upon them. He and\nJanet, clutching each other and staring up in terror at the falling\nblaze from which there seemed no escape. Then relief, as it curved away\nfrom them and fell to the south. And then the explosion, lighting the\nwhole southern sky.\n\nThere was a similar explosion in the screen, when the mass of nega-iron\nlanded--a sheet of pure white light, so bright and so quick as to almost\npass above the limit of visibility, and then a moment's darkness that\nwas in his stunned eyes more than in the screen, and then the rising\nglow of updrawn incandescent dust.\n\nBefore the sound-waves had reached them, he had been legging it into the\nhouse. The television had been on, and it had been acting as insanely as\nthe screen on his right now. He had called the State Police--the\ntelephones had been working all right--and told them who he was, and\nthey had told him to stay put and they'd send a car for him. They did,\nwithin minutes. Janet and his host and hostess had waited with him on\nthe lawn until it came, and after he had gotten into it, he had turned\naround and looked back through the rear window, and seen Janet standing\nunder the front light, holding the little dog in her arms, flopping one\nof its silly little paws up and down with her hand to wave goodbye to\nhim.\n\nHe had seen her and the dog like that every day of his life for the last\nfifteen years.\n\n\"What kind of radiation are you getting?\" he could hear Alexis Pitov\nasking into a phone. \"What? Nothing else? Oh; yes, of course. But mostly\ncosmic. That shouldn't last long.\" He turned from the phone. \"A devil's\nown dose of cosmic, and some gamma. It was the cosmic radiation that put\nthe radios and telescreens out. That's why I insisted that the drone\nplanes be independent of radio control.\"\n\nThey always got cosmic radiation from the micro-annihilations in the\ntest-vault. Well, now they had an idea of what produced natural cosmic\nrays. There must be quite a bit of negamatter and posimatter going into\nmutual annihilation and total energy release through the Universe.\n\n\"Of course, there were no detectors set up in advance around Auburn,\" he\nsaid. \"We didn't really begin to find anything out for half an hour. By\nthat time, the cosmic radiation was over and we weren't getting anything\nbut gamma.\"\n\n\"What--What has Auburn to do--?\" The Russian stopped short. \"You think\nthis was the same thing?\" He gave it a moment's consideration. \"Lee,\nyou're crazy! There wasn't an atom of artificial negamatter in the world\nin 1969. Nobody had made any before us. We gave each other some\nscientific surprises, then, but nobody surprised both of us. You and I,\nbetween us, knew everything that was going on in nuclear physics in the\nworld. And you know as well as I do--\"\n\nA voice came out of the public-address speaker. \"Some of the radio\nequipment around the target area, that wasn't knocked out by blast, is\nbeginning to function again. There is an increasingly heavy gamma\nradiation, but no more cosmic rays. They were all prompt radiation from\nthe annihilation; the gamma is secondary effect. Wait a moment; Captain\nUrquiola, of the Air Force, says that the first drone plane is about to\ntake off.\"\n\nIt had been two hours after the blast that the first drones had gone\nover what had been Auburn, New York. He was trying to remember, as\nexactly as possible, what had been learned from them. Gamma radiation; a\ngreat deal of gamma. But it didn't last long. It had been almost down to\na safe level by the time the investigation had been called off, and, two\nmonths after there had been no more missiles, and no way of producing\nmore, and no targets to send them against if they'd had them, rather--he\nhad been back at Auburn on his hopeless quest, and there had been almost\nno trace of radiation. Nothing but a wide, shallow crater, almost two\nhundred feet in diameter and only fifteen at its deepest, already full\nof water, and a circle of flattened and scattered rubble for a mile and\na half all around it. He was willing to bet anything that that was what\nthey'd find where the chunk of nega-iron had landed, fifty miles away on\nthe pampas.\n\nWell, the first drone ought to be over the target area before long, and\nat least one of the balloons that had been sent up was reporting its\ncourse by radio. The radios in the others were silent, and the recording\ncounters had probably jammed in all of them. There'd be something of\ninterest when the first drone came back. He dragged his mind back to the\npresent, and went to work with Alexis Pitov.\n\nThey were at it all night, checking, evaluating, making sure that the\nmasses of data that were coming in were being promptly processed for\nprogramming the computers. At each of the increasingly frequent\ncoffee-breaks, he noticed Pitov looking curiously. He said nothing,\nhowever, until, long after dawn, they stood outside the bunker, waiting\nfor the jeep that would take them back to their bungalow and watching\nthe line of trucks--Argentine army engineers, locally hired laborers,\nload after load of prefab-huts and equipment--going down toward the\ntarget-area, where they would be working for the next week.\n\n\"Lee, were you serious?\" Pitov asked. \"I mean, about this being like the\none at Auburn?\"\n\n\"It was exactly like Auburn; even that blazing light that came rushing\ndown out of the sky. I wondered about that at the time--what kind of a\nmissile would produce an effect like that. Now I know. We just launched\none like it.\"\n\n\"But that's impossible! I told you, between us we know everything that\nwas happening in nuclear physics then. Nobody in the world knew how to\nassemble atoms of negamatter and build them into masses.\"\n\n\"Nobody, and nothing, on this planet built that mass of negamatter. I\ndoubt if it even came from this Galaxy. But we didn't know that, then.\nWhen that negamatter meteor fell, the only thing anybody could think of\nwas that it had been a Soviet missile. If it had hit around Leningrad or\nMoscow or Kharkov, who would you have blamed it on?\"\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS CORRECTED\n\nThe following typographical errors in the text were corrected as\ndetailed here.\n\nIn the text: \"Could they have built an ICBM with a thermonuclear\nwarhead ...\" the word \"termonuclear\" was corrected to \"thermonuclear.\"\n\nIn the text: \"If it had hit around Leningrad or Moscow ...\" the word\n\"Lenigrad\" was corrected to \"Leningrad.\"\n\nIn the text: \"... from all over South America, from South Africa\nand Australia ...\" the word \"Austrailia\" was corrected to \"Australia.\"\n\nIn the text: \"Or Japan, or the Moslem States....\" the word \"Moselem\"\nwas corrected to \"Moslem.\"\n\nIn the text: \"... the director of the Institute, left ...\" the word\n\"Insitutue\" was corrected to \"Institute.\"\n\nMisspelt proper names were also corrected: \"Klyzneko\" was corrected to\n\"Klyzenko,\" and \"Pitou\" was corrected to \"Pitov.\"\n\n",
