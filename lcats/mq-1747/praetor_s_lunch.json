    "body": "The ancient magistrate is having lunch at noon and these are\nour attempts at capturing his thoughts in the midst of dining.\nThoughts are expressed in both verse and prose form.\nTake this morsel by morsel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIRST MORSEL\nWe wish an end to war with promises and hopes of peace. We wish for peace ,we\nprepare for war. We threaten peace of others with war. We rouse ourselves with the\ncry to arms. In peace or war we are restless. In peace we amuse ourselves by sparring\nand wargames .In war we sing our lamentations of peace.\nWhat are we ? A warlike race intent on keeping an empire with abundance .At the\nsame time advance in all directions with our might.\nThe horns of bulls are never far from another warring bull?s tips. When reins are\nloosened, gates thrown wide ,beasts lunge forth and lock horns again.\nMars. Venus. Ares. Aphrodite. Their temples are extremes. We invoke their benison at\nvarious stages of life.\nNature. Choice. Reason. They hatch outcome. We?re capable of breathing life force\nand personify the two exorbitant passions. There is another passion but its sedateness\nhardly qualifies it for that intense term. It is more an affliction. We are within range\nof it too. This frigid indifference.\n\n\nSECOND MORSEL\nAll will have their day. The thwarted, triumphant. The Gods ,their final say. All will\nbe, whatever they may be. What soothsayers are privy to ,what the oracle withholds.\nThe gods intervene, they alter destinies. It all rests on the will of the Being who wields\nthe armoury of Nature and reins of the universe.\nMiltiades and Alexander crushed the might of armed Persian pride. Marathon and\nSalamis undid Darius and Xerxes.\nPatroclus wasn?t meant to sack Troy. Struck by Apollo, slain by Hector.\nMenelaus could have slain Paris but his sword broke. Paris though defeated was\nspared by Aphrodite who returned him to Trojan lines.\nPandarus? arrow injured Agamemnon . That one arrow aggravated the wounds of\nGreeks. Troy was meant to fall .\nPoseidon shielded Aeneas from the furious sword of Achilles. Rome was meant to be.\n\n\nTHIRD MORSEL\nView of evening and morning are crowning achievements of nature?s light and\nshadow play. The rest of the day is a hiatus between splendour. We need to live\nthrough and endure the rest of it like life. Between glory and triumph, there are those\nsimple times which we seldom note or cherish. Times  of neither sadness or gladness.\nExistential. Not piquant vividness of  acute alertness.\n\n\n\n\n\nFOURTH MORSEL\nTo bear the fruits of victory and to have the muscle of vanquished people, the state\nhas to continually nurture a nation of courageous loyal  citizens. Conquest has to be\nmaintained, watched by ever vigilant sentries and keepers. The state neither needs\nnor reveres idlers whose business is to indulge themselves in Bacchanalian excesses\non account of their ancestry to heroes of preceding generations.\n\nLawmakers duel with wit, logic and words while the war machine duels with tools\nof the army .Laws made or repealed as fearless scions fight for aspirations of a\ngreater state.\nTo safeguard the abundance of far flung regions brought for the enjoyment of the\nhomeland. Have the names of conquerors venerated by the conquered people.\nHave kings, queens and chieftains of unknown lands pay tribute to the imperial\nstandard.\n\n\nFIFTH MORSEL\nTwo friends. They talk of things past, of bets against each other. They laud things,\ncondemn a few and lampoon absurdities.\nThey try things out , chalk up mutual experiences .Argue in good humour.\nThey are both the core of their world. All else backdrops. There are friendships\nwhich rival or surpass the closeness of blood relations.\nOther lives about them are ambience to their drama of life. All that the world holds\nenrich their learning. They have their own company to increase their happiness.\nThey help themselves and with relish exhaust the time granted.\n\n\n\n\nSIXTH MORSEL\nMorning recedes.\nNoon emerges.\n\nUp on the bridge ,the cobbled passage below, the sun nigh. Breeze blows mildly.\nDries noon swelter dry. A column on the march .At the outskirts of the garrison town,\nclatter of horses, armed men of war and metal are accustomed sounds ,\nfamiliar sights.\nJavelins high , tips glinting. Clear without scarlet stains of battle or rust of war.\nChins up. Feet in perfect stride. Sturdy steps in unison.\nBouncing blades , sheathed in their scabbards. Jangling armour as leather soles\nstamp the stone tiled road.\nNeighing mounts , tasselled reins, governed by their masters, they gallop obediently.\nShields glint. Their helmets of war inject ferocity to their visages.\n\nMeridian peaks.\nMorn recedes.\n\nThe proud standard borne by its bearer. Beast?s paws knotted at his chest.\nBeast?s maw agape from the top of his helmet till rear curvature of his neck.\nFangs in line with temples. His cohorts , the horn blowers ride nearby.\nThe visibility and density of dyed tufts discern common soldier from centurion,\ncenturion from officer.\nRed cloaks clasped and drape imperiously over backs of the empire?s officials.\nSaddled snugly atop their mounts, towards destination ,advance.\nTo the horizon ,another outpost awaits them. Keeping their presence seen and\nfelt. Mere manoeuvres .Necessary routine.\nTown square forums and resthouses. Aqueducts and baths of villas. They must forego\nthese comforts. They are duty bound for now.\n\nDaylight recedes.\nEvening emerges.\n\n\n\n\n\nSEVENTH  MORSEL\n\nProsperity has many friends and many envious schemers who duck  at blind corners .\nComrades and kin trumpet deeds . Generosity towards common masses too gains\nfavour .We?ll know it when the market place speak of none but the doer .\nTo detractors, motives are questioned  unflaggingly .\nAny hint of misdemeanour or misstep , the forum echoes with it with the zeal equalled\nonly by the homecoming of a victor crowned with honours  except it?s ill distinction\nand not exalted honour.\nWhisperings at public baths , hastened steps towards or away from the object of their\nspeculation .\nSome will speak well of them. Some will be too distant to know them well enough to\ndislike or to be fond  of with conviction  sprung  from  familiarity. Prosperity puts  a\nperson on  different plain yet this dagger is just as sharp on both sides for the one is\nalso vulnerable to the critical eye of scrutiny.\nDoubts, beliefs , suspicions and truths  addled  with  syllables  which make a name.\nCommon populace , will they choose to know the truth and live with the measure of\na human being or swallow myth and live with the flight of  legend ?\nThat shall be determined by conduct , attainments , favourable circumstances and an\norator?s persuasive logic.\n\n\n\n\n\nEIGHTH  MORSEL\n\nFear their leaders more than their faceless enemies . Guard the standard as if it were\none?s life .A source of pride to be defended. In all manner of weather or even in\npeace\nthe play of battle fills the gap of idleness.\nHardened muscles are not to grow soft and feeble.\n\nBarbaric tribes of east and west. Threats to outer reaches of reign. There our\ngarrisons cannot rest their tools . Craggy mountains and treacherous forests are\nhome to nomadic tribes which live to hunt and plunder , wild like their wilderness\ndwellings.\nThey have neither patience nor skill to cultivate the land. They are not of that ilk.\n\nCities and orderliness are strange to them. They are curiosities amongst us .We are\ngame in their company.\nThey see our numbers and strength .They do not venture forth . An uneasy peace\nsimply broken by the party which is the  first to charge ,  cry out and first to snatch\ntheir arms out of their housing .\n\n\n\nNINTH  MORSEL\n\n?Quot homines tot sententiae.?\nSo many people so many opinions. The voice of the leader slices across the\nindiscernible chatter. All persuading , nobly commanding . A clear voice brings with\nit a defined course. The rest obey , they lack the chief?s possessions.\n?Qualis Rex talis grex?. Such is the leader , such is the people.\nOne?s virtues are taken note of .The  most ardent admirers mold themselves  to that\nmanner. What their leaders do and and do not. Whatever those venerated say or\nwithhold. There are imitators  , emulators , travesty  smiths.\nOnce in a while , one or a small band of them rise to remold status quo. A  wave is\nhatched and unleashed .It becomes an acceptable convention.\nIt is the manner of people that which is proven will be used till the spring is parched\nor when something superior is offered and that offering tickles their longing.\nFar easier to remain constant than alter a course. Given the disposition toward ease ,\nthe well trodden tempts .Yet heed well that it is the passage of tribulation where  the\ncoronet of glory and honour rests on the head of those who are uncowed .They shall\nfind that fame latches  like their own skin to their name .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        TENTH  MORSEL\n\nWe who hold the torch\nWe must be patient\nDecorum requires it\nThe pride of a legion\nlives within its standard\none standard bearer bears\nsacrament of cohorts\n\n\nWe who hold the torch\nWe must be patient\nDecorum requires it\nOne official?s carriage\npersonifies the rest\none written inscription\nultimate seal of fate\n\n\nWe who hold the torch\nWe must be patient\nDecorum requires it\nMake way for those better\nwhile we wait with patience\nallow them the better seats\ntheir merit exceed  ours\n\n\n\n\n\n      ELEVENTH  MORSEL\n\nI am not one to dispute the will of  God ,\ndivine will becomes our lot ,\nbut I question the logic of some .\nFoolish is the soul who enters the place ,\nwho announces his innermost desires ,\nswears a gift in return ,\nshould they be fulfilled ,\nby divine consent ,\nupon his earthly cares ,\nmortal souls have none to offer better ,\nthan the rewards of paradise ,\nwhat are our trappings to heaven ,\nwhen it is God who grants ?\nIt is not worship or invocation ,\nit is a wager posed by hubris ,\ndisplace pomposity and affectation ,\ncome in a penitent pose ,\nhumility warrants attention ,\nor else snuff the lamp ,\ntake the oil elsewhere .\n\n\nI am not one to dispute the will of God ,\ndivine will becomes our lot ,\nbut I question the right of tyrants .\nCharred cities after their sacking ,\nthe cries of dependent humanity ,\nsent to feed searing flames ,\nthe weak , meek and lame ,\nno daylight dawns again ,\na winding trail of chains and clubs ,\nthe gathered wounded  ; conquered ,\nthese tyrants do not govern ,\nthey seize and consume their fill ,\nthen hunger rumbles again ,\nthey repeat their atrocities ,\ntill the Fates pluck them .\nFor each tyrant  reaped ,\nby droves victims precede them ,\ntheir number exceed sacrificial offerings ,\nmade to appease wrathful spirits ,\nor custom of ceremony ,\nof a deity worshipped .\n\n\n\n\nTWELFTH  MORSEL\n\nOur moments of glory\na lifetime to remember\nfair token of youth?s vigour\n\nCarve now before the die sets\nwhile still new and pliable\nwhen it dries your mark stays\nhardened and nobly set\nsurpassing life of wilted crowns\na monument in your honour\n\nOur moments of glory\na lifetime to remember\ncome pay heed to youth?s prayer\n\nWe won?t be here to bother\nhaving surpassed such worries\nearthborn to earth it goes\nlike Assyrian ruins\nto those with merits deserving\nGod and kind Fortune preserve them\n\nOur moments of glory\na lifetime to remember\nmementos of youth?s flower\n\n\n\n\n\nTHIRTEENTH  MORSEL\n\nA peasant who wishes for more\nchanges his plough for arms\nThe army has loyal farmers\nwith absent fathers away far\n\nChildren of empire?s troops\nthough honoured their father?s name\nthey hardly know the man well\nthough his name they proudly bear\n\nYears abroad have rendered fathers\nestranged from families and friends\nyet love and regard still remain\nafter gaps of years and distance\n\nA peasant who wishes for more\nchanges his plough for arms\nfertile fields left idle\nwhile we take grain from conquered lands\n\nFor children whom fathers left\nwhen they were too young to recall\nesteem comes to their hearts prior\nbefore the warmth of filial love\n\nAt long last parted faces meet again\nstrange and familiar strange yet familiar\nthey rekindle ties and retell tidings\nmemories and previous habits return\n\nFertile fields left idle\nwhile we take grain from conquered lands\nthe army has its own farmers\nwith absent fathers battling far\n\nFamilies once again reunited\nwhen warriors in togas turn civilians\ntheir children venture and nestle gladly\n\n\n\n\nFOURTEENTH  MORSEL\n\n?De mortuis nil nisi bonum?\nspeak well of the departed\nor else do not speak at all .\nThe now sacred departed\nimmune to our rebuke\nrejoice with their memory.\n\n?De mortuis nil nisi bonum?\nspeak well of the departed\nor else do not speak at all .\nAllow their good part live on\nthey have gone beyond the gates\nthose whom we regard dearly.\n\n\n\n\nFIFTEENTH  MORSEL\n\nWhat draws us to oracles ?\nThose structures where we worship ,\nThe place where future unfolds ,\nFor those who are uncertain ,\nGripped by Trouble?s tentacles .\n\n\nWhat draws us to oracles ?\nPriests and priestesses reveal ,\nWith omniscience in their being ,\nWith eyes of the temple gods ,\nFree from earthly manacles .\n\n\n\n\nSIXTEENTH  MORSEL\n\nThere is nothing loathsome ,\nin learning from others ,\nwith elders and with peers ,\nwe shared experiences ,\ntreasures of our  youth ,\namusing  in retrospect .\n\nIt is the matter?s worth\nthe source dictates not choice\nprogress comes not from disdain\nto live we nourish the form\nto advance we emulate\nthe source dictates not choice\nIt is the matter?s worth\n\nIf they should enrich us ,\nennoble the manner ,\nmagnify happiness ,\nincrease our contentment ,\nin learning from others ,\nthere is nothing loathsome .\n\n\nSEVENTEENTH  MORSEL\n\nFor common good and for own glory\na seat in the senate\nFor  common cause and own aspirations\na seat in the senate\nFor power over destinies for by themselves  they'll drown\na seat in the senate\nFor a hand in fate and privilege to avert a few unpleasantries\na seat in the senate\nFor the pristine tunic and the challenge to keep it unsoiled\na seat in the senate\nFor rhetoric comes with  quandaries of office\na seat in the senate\nThe toga is equal in prestige with the weight of armour\na seat in the senate\n\n\n\nEIGHTEENTH  MORSEL\n\nArena gladiators\nwith their lives amuse us\nliberty bought with blood\nthe last one is set free.\n\nSlaves of silver mines\nthey crawl in tunnels dark\nthey live with the terror\nof cave-ins and landslides .\n\nPrivilege of victory\nmarked by thriving slavery\nof  people subjugated.\n\nThe nameless galley slaves\nunpaid naval oarsmen\nchained to oars in battle\nlive or drown with the ship.\n\nSlaves who serve the household\nby bonded servitude\nare bound to their masters\nfor their food and lodging.\n\nOur state's territory\nwith empire's history\nadorned with places conquered.\n\n\n\n      NINETEENTH  MORSEL\n\nPORTION  I\n\ncallow upstarts\nthose who dare advise\nhindrances  to them\n\ncallow upstarts\nheedless of counsel\nunfelled by the mace\nuncut by the blade\nyoung and rash\n\ncallow upstarts\nthey shall not avert\nexcept the obvious\n\n\nPORTION  II\n\nTo the philosopher\nthoughts and writings\nare his close friends\nhe sees to needs\nhe then dotes on\nwork and study\n\nTo the philosopher\nthoughts and writings\nare his dear friends\nexile?s release\nfrom sycophants\nwary of him\n\n\n      TWENTIETH   MORSEL\n\nEmotion in the thick of bandying\nEloquence is reduced to instinct\nThe will to survive repeats in mind\nAsserts itself amidst the bedlam\nBarbaric ululations and cries\nEnemy?s breath and blows on the flesh\nAttack..defend..retaliate..avenge\nAdvance..retreat..encircle..scatter\nThere is no room to mourn the fallen\nWhile in the midst of war?s grim reaping\nThose destined to live long and see much\nShall live and thrive long after youth?s bloom .\n\n\nTWENTY  FIRST  MORSEL\n\nOne class wash clothing\ninside common pools\nwith scent and reek of others? washing\nOne class have clothing\ncleaned inside clear pools\nwater stored in lavish amphoraes\nDisparity exists\neven in the city of the world\n\nA part of the city\nis alive when the sun is out\nA part of the city\nlanguishes in darkness at dusk\nThe beast of disparity\nalso dwells and lurks in Rome\n\nGarrisons guard borders ever vigilantly\nbehind stone slabs of sturdy fortress walls\nBut it is  too risky to take a walk at night\nin the city without armed entourage\nOne quarter boasts stone and marble\nOne quarter built from brick and wood\nDisparity exists\neven in the city of the world",
