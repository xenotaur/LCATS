    "body": "[Sidenote: _They were out of place in the Manly Age--Stonecypher, a man\nwho loved animals; Moe, a bull who hated men. Together, they marched to\ninevitably similar destinies...._]\n\n\n\n\nPRELUDE\n\n\nM. Stonecypher lifted his reed sun hat with the square brim, and used a\nred handkerchief to absorb the perspiration streaking his forehead. He\nsaid, \"The pup'll make a good guard, 'especially for thrill parties.\"\n\nL. Dan's golden curls flickered in July 1 sunlight. The puppy growled\nwhen Dan extended a gloved hand. \"I don't want a guard,\" the hobbyist\nsaid. \"I want him for a dogfight.\"\n\nA startling bellow rattled the windows of the dog house and spilled in\ndeafening waves across the yard. Dan whirled, clutching his staff. Light\nglinted on his plastic cuirass and danced on his red nylon tights. His\nflabby face turned white. \"What--\" he panted.\n\nStonecypher concealed a smile behind a long corded hand and said, \"Just\nthe bull. Serenades us sometimes.\"\n\nDan circled the dog house. Stonecypher followed with a forefinger\npressed to thin lips. In the paddock, the bull's head moved up and down.\nIt might or might not have been a nod.\n\nThe crest of long red and blue-black hairs on the bull's neck and\nshoulders created an illusion of purple, but the rest of the animal\nmatched the black of a duelmaster's tam. Behind large eyes encircled by\na white band, his skull bulged in a swelling dome, making the distance\nbetween his short horns seem much too great.\n\n\"He's purple!\" Dan gasped. \"Why in the Government don't you put him in\nthe ring?\"\n\nStonecypher gestured toward the choppy surface of Kings Lake, nine\nhundred feet below. He said, \"Coincidence. I make out the ringmaster's\nbarge just leavin' Highland Pier.\"\n\n\"You're selling him?\"\n\n\"Yeah. If they take 'im. I'd like to see 'im in the ring on Dependence\nDay.\"\n\nGlancing at the watch embedded in the left pectoral of his half-armor,\nDan said, \"That would be a show! I'll take the dog and fly. I've a duel\nin Highland Park at 11:46.\"\n\n\"The pup's not for sale.\"\n\n\"Not for sale!\" Dan yelled. \"You told--\"\n\n\"Thought you wanted a guard. I don't sell for dogfights.\"\n\nA sound like \"Goood!\" came from the paddocked bull.\n\nDan opened his mouth wide. Whatever he intended to say died without\nvocalization, for Catriona came driving the mule team up through the\napple orchard. The almost identical mules had sorrel noses, gray necks,\nbuckskin flanks, and black and white pinto backs and haunches. \"Great\nGovernment!\" Dan swore. \"This place is worse than a museum!\"\n\n\"Appaloosa mules,\" Stonecypher said.\n\nCatriona jumped from the seat of the mowing machine. Dan stared.\nCompared to the standard woman of the Manly Age who, by dieting,\nposturing, and exercise from childhood, transformed herself into a\nsmall, thin, dominated creature, Catriona constituted a separate\nspecies. She was taller than Dan, slightly plump, and her hair could\nhave been classed as either red or blonde. Green overalls became her\nbetter than they did Stonecypher. With no trace of a smile on face or in\nvoice, Stonecypher said, \"L. Dan, meet Catriona.\"\n\n\n\nLike a hypnopath's victim, Dan walked to Catriona. He looked up at her\nand whispered, but too loudly. Stonecypher heard. His hands clamped on\nthe hobbyist's neck and jerked. Dan smashed in the grass with sufficient\nforce to loosen the snaps of his armor. He rolled to his feet and swung\nhis staff.\n\nStonecypher's left hand snatched the staff. His right fist collided with\nDan's square jaw. Glaring down at the hobbyist, Stonecypher gripped the\nstaff and rotated thick wrists outward. The tough plastic popped when it\nbroke.\n\nScuttling backward, Dan regained his feet. \"You inhuman brute!\" he\ngrowled. \"I intended to pay for her!\"\n\n\"My wife's not for sale either,\" Stonecypher said. \"You know how to\nfly.\"\n\nDan thrust out a coated tongue and made a noise with it. In a memorized\nsingsong, he declared, \"I challenge you to a duel, in accordance with\nthe laws of the Government, to be fought in the nearest duelpen at the\nearliest possible hour.\"\n\n\"Stony, don't!\" Catriona protested. \"He's not wo'th it!\"\n\nStonecypher smiled at her. \"Have to follow the law,\" he said. He\nextended his tongue, blurted, and announced, \"As required by the\nGovernment, I accept your challenge.\"\n\n\"We'll record it!\" Dan snapped. He stalked toward the green and gold\nbutterflier parked in a field of seedling Sudan grass. Horns rattled on\nthe concrete rails of the paddock.\n\n\"Burstaard!\" the bull bellowed.\n\nDan shied and trampled young grass under sandaled feet. His loosened\ncuirass clattered rhythmically. Raising the canopy of the butterflier,\nhe slid out the radioak and started typing. Stonecypher and Catriona\napproached the hobbyist. Catriona said, \"This is cowa'dly! Stony nevah\nfought a duel in his life. He won't have a chance!\"\n\n\"You'll see me soon then, woman. Where'd you get all that equipment? You\nlook like something in a circus.\"\n\n\"Ah used to be in a cahnival,\" Catriona said. She kept Stonecypher in\nplace with a plump arm across his chest. \"That's wheah you belong,\" she\ntold Dan. \"That's all you'ah good fo'.\"\n\n\"Watch how you address a man, woman,\" Dan snarled, \"or you'll end in the\nduelpen, too.\"\n\nStonecypher snatched the sheet from the typer. The request read:\n\n     Duelmaster R. Smith, Watauga Duelpen, Highland Park, Tennessee.\n     L. Dan challenges M. Stonecypher. Cause: Interference with\n     basic amatory rights. July 1. 11:21 amest.\n\nStonecypher said, \"The cause is a lie. You got no rights with Catriona.\nWhy didn't you tell 'em it's because I knocked you ears-over-endways,\nand you're scared to fight without a gun?\"\n\nDan shoved the request into the slot and pulled the switch. \"I'll kill\nyou,\" he promised.\n\nWhile the request was transmitted by radiophotography, minutes passed,\nbare of further insults. Catriona and Stonecypher stood near the\nconcrete fence enclosing the rolling top of Bays Mountain. Interminable\nlabor had converted 650 acres of the top to arable land. Below the\ncouple, the steep side of the mountain, denuded of timber, dangerously\neroded, and scarred by limestone quarries, fell to the ragged shore of\nKings Lake. Two miles of water agitated by many boats separated the\nshore and the peninsula, which resembled a wrinkled dragon with\nunderslung lower jaw distended. The town of Highland Park clung to the\njutting land, and the Highland Bullring appeared as a white dot more\nthan four miles from where Catriona and Stonecypher stood. The\nringmaster's barge was a red rectangle skirting Russel Chapel Island.\n\nDan pulled the answer from the buzzing radioak. He walked over and held\nthe radiophoto an inch from Stonecypher's long nose. It read:\n\n     Request OK. Time: July 4. 3:47 pmest.\n\nTwo attached permits granted each duelist the privilege of carrying one\nhandgun with a capacity of not more than ten cartridges of not less\nthan .32 caliber. Below the permits appeared an additional message:\n\n     L. Dan due at Watauga Duelpen. 11:46 amest. For duel with J.\n     George.\n\n\"Government and Taxes!\" Dan cursed. Throwing Stonecypher's permit, he\nleaped into the green and gold butterflier and slammed the canopy. The\nfour wings of the semi-ornithopter blurred with motion, lifting the\ncraft into the sky. The forward wings locked with negative dihedral, the\nrear wings angled to form a ruddevator, and the five-bladed propeller\nwhined, driving the butterflier in a shallow dive for the peninsula.\n\n\n\nCatriona said, \"Ah hope he's late, and they shoot him. Ah knew you'd\nfinally have to fight, but--\"\n\n\"You keep out of it next time,\" said Stonecypher. \"I happen to know that\nfeller's killed two women in the pen. He don't care for nothin'. Oughta\nknown better than to let him come here. He made out like he wanted a\nguard dog, and I thought--\"\n\n\"Nevah mind, Stony. Ah've got to help you. You nevah even fiahed a gun.\"\n\n\"Later, Cat. The ringmaster may want to stay for dinner. I'll look after\nthe mules.\"\n\nCatriona touched Stonecypher's cheek and went to the house. Stonecypher\nunharnessed the Appaloosa mules. While they rolled, he took, from an\nempty hay rack, a rubber-tipped spear and a tattered cloth dummy. The\ndummy's single arm terminated in a red flag.\n\nStonecypher concealed spear and dummy beneath the floor of the dog\nhouse. Going to the paddock, he patted the bull between the horns, which\nhad been filed to a needle point. \"Still goin' through with it?\"\nStonecypher asked.\n\n\"Yaaaa,\" the bull lowed. \"Yaooo kuhl Daan. Err'll kuhl uhhh kuhlerrs.\"\n\n\"All right, Moe. I'll kill Dan, and you kill the killers.\" Stonecypher\nstroked the massive hemisphere of the bull's jaw. \"Goodbye, Moe.\"\n\n\"Gooodba,\" the bull echoed. He lowered his nose to the shelled corn\nseasoned with molasses, the rolled oats, and the ground barley in the\ntrough.\n\nStonecypher walked down the road to the staircase of stone that dammed\nthe old Kingsport Reservoir, abandoned long before Kings Lake covered\nthe city. A red electric truck crawled up the steep road hewn from the\nslope of the gap formed by Dolan Branch. When the truck had crossed the\nbridge below the buttressed dam, Stonecypher spoke to the fat and\nsweltering man seated beside the driver. \"I'm M. Stonecypher. Proud for\nyou to visit my farm. Dinner's ready up at the house.\"\n\n\"No, no time,\" smiled the fat man, displaying stainless steel teeth.\n\"Only time to see the bull. I thought we weren't going to make that\ngrade! Why don't those scientists develop synthetic elements, so that we\ncan have atomic power again? This radio-electric is so unreliable! I am\nRingmaster A. Oswell, naturally. This heat is excruciating! I had hoped\nit would be cooler up here, but something seems to have happened to our\ninland-oceanic climate this summer. Lead us to the bull, Stonecypher!\"\n\nClinging to the slatted truck bed, Stonecypher directed the stoic driver\nto the paddock. The electric motor rattled and stopped, and Ringmaster\nOswell wheezed and squirmed from the cab. The ringmaster wore a vaguely\nArabic costume, in all variations of red.\n\nThe bull lumbered bellowing around the fence. His horns raked white\ngashes in the beech tree forming one corner. He tossed the feed trough\nto splintering destruction.\n\n\"Magnificent!\" Oswell gasped. Then the ringmaster frowned. \"But he looks\nalmost purple. His horns are rather short.\"\n\n\"Stay back from the fence!\" Stonecypher warned. \"He's real wide between\nthe horns, ringmaster. I reckon the spread'll match up to standard. Same\nstock my grandfather used to sell Boon Bullring before the water.\nWouldn't sell 'im, only the tenants are scared to come about the house.\"\n\nOswell fingered his balloon neck and mumbled, \"But he's odd. That long\nhair on his neck ... I don't know....\"\n\nThe bull's horns lifted the mineral feeder from the center of the\npaddock. The box rotated over the rails and crashed in a cloud of\nfloured oyster shells and phosphate salt at the ringmaster's feet.\n\nOswell took cover behind the truck driver, who said, \"Fergus'd like him.\nJeeze! Remember dat brown and white spotted one he kilt last year on\nForrest Day? Da crowd like ta never stopt yelling!\"\n\nRingmaster Oswell retreated farther, as, under the bull's onslaught, a\npiece of concrete broke from the top rail, exposing the reinforcing rod\nwithin. \"Fergus does like strange ones,\" he admitted.\n\nStonecypher said, \"Don't let the mane bother you. There's one of these\nlong-haired Scotch cows in his ancestors. He's not really purple. Just\nthe way the light hits 'im.\"\n\nOswell chewed lacquered fingernails with steel dentures. His bloodshot\neyes studied the spotted and speckled Appaloosa mules chasing around the\npasture, but the sight failed to register on his brain. \"The crowd likes\na good show on Dependence Day,\" he proclaimed. \"I considered trying a\nfat Aberdeen Angus with artificial horns for laughs, but this may do as\nwell. I must find some shade! I'll take him, Stonecypher, if fifteen\nhundred in gold is agreeable.\"\n\n\"Sold,\" Stonecypher said. The word cracked in the middle.\n\nWhile the ringmaster, muttering about trying bulldogs sometime, retired\nto the narrow shadow of the dog house, the driver backed the truck to\nthe ramp. Stonecypher opened the gate and waved his handkerchief. The\nbull charged into the truck, and the driver locked the heavy doors.\n\nFrom within his red burnoose, Oswell produced a clinking bag. \"Fifteen\nhundred,\" he said. From other recesses, he withdrew documents,\nnotebooks, and a pencil. He said, \"Here is a pass for you and one for\nany woman-subject you may wish to bring. You'll want to see your first\nbull on Dependence Day! And here is the standard release absolving you\nof any damage the bull may do. Oh, yes! His name and number?\"\n\n\"Number?\"\n\n\"Yes, his brand.\"\n\n\"Not branded. Make it Number 1. Name's Moe.\"\n\nOswell chuckled. \"Moe. Very good! Most breeders name them things like\nChainlightning and Thunderbird. Your GE number?\"\n\n\"I'm not a Government Employee.\"\n\n\"You're not?\" Oswell wheezed. \"How unusual! Your colors? He'll wear your\ncolors in his shoulder.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Black.\"\n\n\"Black?\"\n\n\"Dead black.\"\n\nOswell, scribbling, managed a faint smile. \"Sorry I can't accept that\ninvitation to lunch.\" He struggled into the truck. \"Hope this bull is\nbrave in the ring. Nice antique old place you have here! I don't see a\nfeed tower, but you surely don't use pasture--\" The ringmaster's babble\npassed down the road with the truck.\n\nStonecypher watched the vehicle descend the dangerous grade. He lifted\nhis square hat from his black hair, dropped it on the ground, and\ncrushed the reeds under a booted foot.\n\nThe temporary house, a squat cubical structure, stood at the end of a\nspruce-lined path beside the ruin that a thrill party had made of the\ncentury-old farm house. The plastic screen squeaked when Stonecypher\nopened it. He stood on the white floor of the robot kitchen and dug a\nfifty dollar gold piece from the bag Oswell had given him. Glaring at\nthe head of the woman with Liberty inscribed on her crown, he muttered,\n\"Thirty pieces of gold.\"\n\nCatriona called, \"Oswell's lucky he couldn't stay foah dinnah! Ah had\nthe potassium cyanide all ready.\"\n\nStonecypher passed through the diner door into a room containing more\nyellowed history books and agricultural pamphlets than eating utensils.\nCatriona waited by the table. She held a large revolver in her right\nhand.\n\n\n\n\nINTERMEZZO\n\n\nStonecypher stood on Bay Knob, near the ruins of the old FM transmitter\nstation, looking down at the Tennessee Lakes. Catriona sat behind him\nand held the revolver on her thigh. Stonecypher said, \"I never see it\nbut I wonder how it looked before the water.\"\n\nBefore him, North Fork, an arm of Kings Lake, twisted across the\nVirginia line four and one-half miles away, while to Stonecypher's\nright, Boone Lake sparkled like a gigantic, badly drawn V. He did not\nlook toward Surgoinsville Dam securing Kings Lake far to the west.\n\nThe Tennessee Lakes were born in 1918 when Wilson Dam spanned the\nTennessee River at Muscle Shoals, Alabama; but their growth was retarded\nfor fifteen years, until an Act of Congress injected them with vitamins.\nThen the mile-long bastions of concrete crawled between the ridges.\nNorris, Wheeler, Pickwick Landing, Guntersville, Watts Bar, Kentucky,\nCherokee, Fort Henry, Boone, Sevier, Surgoinsville--almost innumerable\ndams blocked the rivers. The rivers stopped and overflowed. The creeks\nswelled into rivers.\n\nCongressional Committees investigated, the Supreme Court tested the dams\nagainst the Constitution, ethnologists and archeologists hastily checked\nfor Indian relics; and the dams, infused with youthful vigor, matured.\nBeginning with Norris, which backed up the Clinch and Powell Rivers to\ninundate 25,000 acres and displace 3,000 families, the dams expanded\nmighty aquatic muscles. The Tennessee, the Little Tennessee, the\nNolichucky, the Holston, the French Broad, the Watauga, the Hiwassee,\nthe Little Pigeon--all the rivers spread their waters into lengthy,\nragged lakes, changing the map of Tennessee more than any natural\ncataclysm, such as the great earthquake of 1811, had ever done. The\nLakes provided jobs, electric power, flood control, soil conservation, a\nfisherman's paradise, milder winters, cooler summers, and they covered\nall the really good farming land in the eastern part of the state.\n\nCatriona loaded the revolver. It was an obsolete .357 Magnum with a\n6-1/2 inch barrel, and the cartridge cases of the metal-piercing bullets\nhad a greenish sheen. \"Now, put it in the holstah, and be ca'eful,\"\nCatriona said.\n\nStonecypher wore the holster, a leather silhouette studded with two\nspring clips opening forward, on a belt and secured to his leg by a\nthong. Gingerly, he took the revolver and slipped it under the clips.\n\"I've kept outa duels all my life,\" he said, \"but, so long as it's for\nyou, I don't much mind.\"\n\n\"Ah'll mind if he kills you. You do like I tell you, and you can beat\nhim. Why, mah best act in the How-To Cahnival was How to Win a Duel.\nCou'se, they didn't know ah was really drawin' befoah the buzzah\nsounded. Why, ah used to set two plates ten yahds apaht, draw two\nrevolvahs, and shoot both plates, all in foah-tenths of a second!\"\n\nStonecypher grinned. \"Sorry I missed that carnival first time it came\nthrough here. I coulda seen you in that costume they poured on you,\nthree years earlier.\"\n\n\"Nevah mind the veiled compliments. Now, try it!\"\n\nStonecypher faced the target, a sheet of plastiboard roughly sawed to\nthe shape of a man, and backed by a heap of earth removed from the new,\nas yet dry, pond in which they stood. Catriona pressed a small buzzer\nconcealed in her palm. Stonecypher's big hand closed on the revolver\nbutt, pushing the weapon up and forward. The sound of the shot rattled\naway over the mountain top.\n\n\"That's good!\" Catriona cried, consulting the sonic timer. \"One and\ntwo-tenths seconds from buzzah to shot!\"\n\n\"But I missed,\" Stonecypher protested. \"Look bad on tevee.\"\n\n\"You'll hit him. Watch the recoil next time.\"\n\nStonecypher drew and fired a second wild shot. He snorted, \"Confound\nWesterns, anyhow!\"\n\n\"Weste'ns?\"\n\n\"Sure. That's where this duelin' started. Used to, almost ever' movie or\ntevee was called a Western. Sort of a fantasy, because they were just\nslightly based on real history. They generally showed a feller in a\nflowered shirt, ridin' a Tennessee Walking Horse, and shootin' a gun.\nEver'body in these Westerns had a gun, and they all shot at each other.\n\n\"The youngin's were hep on 'em, so they all wore toy guns, and a whole\ngeneration grew up on Westerns. When they got big, they carried real\nguns. I've heard my great-uncle tell about it, how before the Government\nbuilt duel-pens and passed laws, you couldn't hardly cross the Lakes\nwithout runnin' into a bunch of fools on water skis shootin' at each\nother.\"\n\n\"You leave the histo'y books alone foah awhile,\" Catriona commanded,\n\"and practice. The tenants and ah'll tend to the wo'k. Try it loaded and\nempty. Hook this little buzzah to the timeah, and practice. Ah've got to\ngo see the chickens.\"\n\n\"'Bye, teacher.\" Stonecypher dropped the buzzer in his pocket and\nwatched her vanish into the grove. He fired the remaining shots, nicking\nthe target once. With the revolver holstered, he followed the path to\nthe summer pasture.\n\n\n\nBelly-deep in red clover, twenty-four cows, twenty-four calves, and\ntwenty-four yearlings grazed or played in the shady field. Stonecypher\ncupped his hands around his mouth and yelled, \"Smart-calves!\nSmart-calves to school!\"\n\nThe entire herd turned sorrowful eyes on him. Seven of the calves and\nfour of the yearlings trotted to the gate, which Stonecypher held open,\nand jostled out of the pasture. As the calves began to lie down under\nthe trees, a white heifer-calf nuzzled Stonecypher's hand and bawled,\n\"Paaapy gyoing a fyightt?\"\n\n\"Yeah, he's goin' to fight,\" Stonecypher answered. \"Your pappy's gone to\nthe bullring. He suggested it, and made the choice himself. He's got\nreal courage. You oughta all be proud of him.\"\n\nThe calves bawled their pride. Including those remaining in the pasture,\nthey presented a colorful variety of spots, specks, splotches, browns,\nreds, blacks, and even occasional blue and greenish tinges. Stonecypher\nsat facing them from a stump. He said, \"I'm sorta late for the lesson,\ntoday, so we'll get on with it. Some of this will be repetition for you\nyearlings, but it won't hurt. If you get too bored, there's corn and\ncottonseed meal in the trough, only be quiet about it.\n\n\"Now. To look at you all, nobody would think you're the same breed of\ncattle; but you, and your mammys, and Moe are the only Atohmy cattle on\nEarth. It's usually hard to say exactly when a breed started; but you\nall started a long, long time ago, on July 16, 1945, near Alamogordo,\nNew Mexico, when they exploded the first Atomic Bomb.\"\n\nAt mention of Atomic Bomb, who had succeeded the Bogger Man as a means\nof frightening children, one of the younger calves bawled. Her polled,\nbrindled mother ran in ungainly fashion to the fence and mooed with\ngreat carrying power.\n\n\"All right!\" Stonecypher yelled. The cow closed her big mouth, but\nstayed by the gate. \"Can't go by what you hear the tenants tell their\nkids,\" Stonecypher cautioned the calf. \"Atomic Bomb is as dead as the\ntank and the battleship.\n\n\"Now, like I was sayin', the scientists put Atomic Bomb on a hundred\nfoot tower and blowed him up. There was a flash of fire, and an awful\nracket, and the blast raised up a lot of dirt and dust from the ground.\nAll this dust achurnin' around in the cloud bumped into little bits of\nmetal and stuff that was highly radioactive. That means, the basic atoms\nof matter had been thrown out of kilter, sorta deranged. The protons and\nelectrons in an atom oughta be about equal for it to be stable, but\nthese were shootin' off electrons, or beta particles, and givin' off\nsomething like powerful x-rays, called gamma rays, and things like that.\n\n\"Anyhow, this radiation affected all the sand and bits of rock and dirt\nin that bomb cloud. This radiation is dangerous. Some of it will go\nright through several inches of lead. Enough'll kill you. Your ancestors\nwere ten miles or so from where Atomic Bomb went off.\n\n\"They were just plain Whiteface cattle. They weren't supposed to be\nthere, but I reckon none of the scientists bothered to warn 'em. The\ndust started settlin' all over your ancestors. In about a week, there\nwere sores and blisters on their backs. The red hair dropped off. When\nit grew back, it was gray.\n\n\"The scientists got real excited when they heard about it, 'cause they\nwanted to see how horrible they could make Atomic Bomb. So, they shipped\nfifty-nine cattle up to Oak Ridge. That was a Government town, a hundred\nmiles southwest of here, where they made some of the stuff to put in\nAtomic Bomb. The University of Tennessee was runnin' an experimental\nfarm there. They had donkeys, and pigs, and chickens, and other animals\nthat they exposed to radioactivity. Then they killed 'em and cut 'em up\nto see what had happened. I know it's gruesome, but that's how it was.\n\n\"The awful fact is, the scientists slaughtered more than half that\noriginal Atohmy herd for experiments. Some of the rest,\nthey--uh--married. Wanted to see if the calves had two heads, or\nsomething; if radioactivity had speeded up the mutation rate.\n\n\"Back then, they didn't understand much about mutation. Some claimed a\nlittle radioactivity would cause it, some said a whole lot, and some\nsaid it wouldn't hurt a bit.\"\n\n\"Whaa mootyaaonn?\" asked the calf which was not yet assured of the\nextinction of Atomic Bomb.\n\n\"Well, you-all are all mutations. I've told you how life starts from one\ncell. This cell has thread-like things in it called chromosomes, and the\nchromosomes are made up of things called genes. Mutations, sort of\nunexpected changes, can take place in either the chromosomes or the\ngenes. You see, when this one cell starts dividing, every gene makes a\ncopy of itself; but, sometimes, the copy is a little different from the\noriginal. Lots of things, like x-rays and ultraviolet rays, heat,\nchemicals, disease, can cause this. Radioactivity had caused mutation in\nsome experiment, so the scientists were anxious to see what happened\nwith these cattle.\n\n\"Genes determine the way an animal develops. Two mutant genes can start\nreactions that end up as a man with one leg, or maybe as a bull with the\nintelligence of an eight-year-old man. Lots of mutations are recessive.\nThey may be carried along for generations. But, when two like mutant\ngenes come together in reproduction, the animal is bound to be something\ndifferent, the way you eleven calves are.\n\n\"Now. The scientists watched the Atohmy cattle for fifteen or twenty\nyears, and nothin' much happened. They started sayin' radioactivity\nwasn't dangerous, and a man could walk into a place right after Atomic\nBomb went off, and it wouldn't matter. They should be here to see the\nmess in Japan today. All the time, though, I think the cattle were\nchanging. It may have been in little things like the length of hair, or\nthe shape of an eyeball, or the curve of a horn, so the scientists\ncouldn't tell without they made exact measurements all the time.\n\n\"Then, a bull-calf was born. He had shaggy black hair, and his horns\ngrew in a spiral like a ram's. Some scientists said, 'I told you so! It\nspeeded the mutation rate!'\n\n\"Others said, 'He's a natural mutation, or else, a throw-back to\nprehistoric wild cattle. It happens in every breed. Atomic Bomb had\nnothing to do with it.'\n\n\"They married the bull, and then they fixed to slaughter 'im to see what\nhis insides was like. The bull fooled 'em, though. He came down with\ncontagious pleuro-pneumonia, the first case in years, 'cause it was\nsupposed to have been wiped out in this country away back in the\nNineteenth Century. They had to cremate the bull for fear the disease\nwould spread. Ever' one of the calves were normal Whitefaces.\n\n\"Finally, the nineteen Atohmy cattle that were left were put up for\nsale. My great-grandfather, Cary McPheeter, bought 'em and shipped 'em\nhere to Bays Mountain. He's the man started this farm where there was\nnothin' but rattlesnakes, and trees, and rocks.\"\n\n\"Whyy theyea selll um?\" a red roan calf interrupted.\n\n\"Well, they sold 'em 'cause Oak Ridge had been condemned. That was\nseveral years after the German Civil War. It was peace time, for a\nchange, and folks were sick of Atomic Bomb. Anyhow, new, modern plants\nfor makin' the stuff had been built in secret places a lot easier to\ndefend. The women were cryin' for more automatic kitchens, so the Bureau\nof Interior Hydro-electric Power (that's the name Federal Power, Inc.,\nwent by then) put another dam across the Clinch River below Norris. Bush\nLake covered up Oak Ridge.\n\n\"There wasn't much mutation, except for color, in you Atohmy cattle,\ntill seven years ago when your pappy, Moe, was born. I remember--\"\n\nA hoarse excited voice shouted from a distance. \"Thrill party!\" it\ncried. \"Thrill party!\"\n\n\n\nStonecypher leaped off the stump, stamped his right foot to restore\ncirculation, and yelled on the run, \"That's all today! Stay under the\ntrees!\"\n\nHe loped along the pasture fence and across the makeshift target range.\nTwo tenants, Teddy and Will, stood on the dirt heap with pitchforks in\ntheir hands. Over Bay Knob, an old Model 14 butterflier hovered on\nvibrating wings. Sloppy white letters on the sides of the aircraft\nspelled such slang expressions as, \"Flash the MAGNETS,\"\n\"SupercOlossalSoniC Flap ship,\" and \"Redheads amble OTHer canop.\"\n\nAn impossible number of middleschool-age boys bulged from the cabin\nwindows. Methodically, they dumped trash and garbage over the\ntransmitter station ruins. The butterflier wheeled and flapped over the\npasture. Red clover bent and writhed in the artificial wind from the\nornithopter wings. Cows bawled and ran wild. Calves fell over each\nother.\n\nStonecypher jumped the fence. He wrested the revolver from the holster.\n\"Clear out, or I'll shoot!\" he howled.\n\nVoices spilled from the butterflier. \"He got a handgun!\"\n\n\"Dis ain't legal!\"\n\n\"Whatcha say, tall, bones, and ugly?\"\n\nStonecypher aimed the Magnum at the shaven head in the pilot's seat. The\nboys looked faint. Agitated air thundered as the butterflier lifted\nstraight up two hundred feet and glided away in the direction of\nSurgoinsville Dam.\n\nTeddy and Will stood by with pitchforks unrelaxed. Will spat a globule\nof tobacco juice. \"The thangs these here psychologists git made law!\" he\nsneered. \"You want me to make out a Thrill Damage Claim?\"\n\n\"No, Will,\" Stonecypher said, \"just deduct it from taxes.\"\n\nTeddy looked at the revolver and said, \"Ever'body oughta take guns to\nthem crazy youngin's. Reckon you'll git into trouble?\"\n\n\"No. It's an empty antique. That's legal. You guys did all right. Let\nthe calves back in, huh?\"\n\nThe tenants left by the gate, and, with a minimum of driving, urged the\ncalves into the pasture. Stonecypher watched the men pass through the\ngrove. Although the tenants undoubtedly recognized the peculiarities of\nthe calves, they never mentioned them. Since the late 1700's, through\nRevolution, Civil War, automobile, the Department of Internal Revenue,\nthe multiple bureaus that had controlled the Lakes, the Moon rocket, and\nthe expedition to Pluto, these people had remained suspiciously\ninterested in strangers, suspicious of indoor plumbing, doubtful of the\nGovernment, quick-tempered, and as immovable as Chimney Top. They had\nexchanged little except log and frame houses for concrete. The tenants,\nnot really tenants, had been squatting on Bays Mountain when Cary\nMcPheeter bought the farm; and there they stayed.\n\nStonecypher vaulted the fence. Catriona, with hands firmly planted on\nhips, stood in the dry pond. Stonecypher said, \"If I just knew what\nthese thrill parties think they're up to, it might help.\"\n\nCatriona shook her head of red-yellow hair. \"Nevah mind them. Ah told\nyou to practice shootin', but the minute ah turn mah back, you run off\nand staht teachin' those calves! You've got to practice, Stony! You've\nnevah done any shootin', and L. Dan's killed ten people. Ah--\"\n\n\"Watch the tears, or you'll have red and green eyes,\" Stonecypher said.\nClumsily, he ejected the shells and reloaded the revolver. He occupied\ntwo seconds in drawing and firing. The bullet struck dirt a yard to the\nleft of the target.\n\n\n\n\nSONATA\n\n\nA short vicious thunderstorm lashed Bays Mountain on the afternoon of\nJuly 3. As the storm passed, a blood-red butterflier, with a pusher\npropeller in the tail and a plastic bull head on the nose, descended in\nthe young Sudan grass. Stonecypher dropped the saw--he had been clearing\naway a beech limb the storm left in the abandoned paddock--and strolled\nto greet Ringmaster A. Oswell.\n\n\"Stonecypher!\" the ringmaster announced. \"That storm almost caught us!\"\nOswell's stainless steel teeth clacked, and the breezes trailing the\nthunderclouds ballooned his orange silk kimono. \"I never liked these\nbutterfliers. They're too slow, and that swooping motion! Five hundred\nmiles per hour may seem fast to a man your age; but in my day, back\nbefore petroleum was classified as armament, we had jets! Real speed!\"\n\n\"Come on up to the house, ringmaster,\" Stonecypher invited. \"I'll mix up\nsome dextrose and citric acid.\"\n\n\"No, no time,\" the fat man panted. \"Only time to see you about that bull\nyou sold me. The storm took a limb of your beech tree! Almost the only\none left, I suppose. About that bull, Stonecypher, you know I was a bit\nhesitant when I bought him, but my driver talked me into it. I'm so\ndisappointed I had him drafted immediately!\"\n\n\"But, what--\" Stonecypher attempted to ask.\n\n\"The young woman there in the butterflier is a much better driver and\npilot,\" Oswell babbled. \"I wouldn't have believed it of a woman! She\nweighs a good ninety-eight pounds, too! That bull--he has changed\ncompletely since we put him under the stands. He eats well, but he shows\nno spirit at all. Tomorrow is the big day, Stonecypher! I can't\ndisappoint the crowd! I thought he might be sick, but the vet says not.\nThat bull let the vet come into the cage and made absolutely no attempt\nto kill him!\"\n\n\"But does Fergus--\"\n\n\"Fergus's manager saw the bull! He's all for it. Fergus made an\nextremely poor showing on Memorial Day, and the manager thinks this odd\nbull would provide a real comeback! I advised against it. This heat is\nterrible! The storm didn't cool the air at all.\"\n\nStonecypher maneuvered the perspiring ringmaster into the shade of the\nbeech. He said, \"I wanta do the fair thing with you, ringmaster, so I'll\ngive you a guarantee, in writing if you want. If that bull's not the\nbravest ever fought in Highland Bullring, I give you double-money-back.\"\n\nOswell's face wobbled in a tentative smile. He counted his stubby\nfingers. \"Double-money-back?\"\n\n\"Yeah. I wanta get into the business. My grandfather used to sell bulls.\nThen my father came along, and he wouldn't sell a one.\"\n\n\"Yes. Yes, I once tried to reason with him, but--\"\n\n\"He had funny ideas,\" Stonecypher pressed his advantage. \"I never did\nunderstand the old man myself. He used to lecture me on something he\ncalled the Man-Animal War. He said one of the worst things in the war\nwas the thousands of bulls that had been tortured to death.\"\n\n\"Peculiar idea. Of course--\"\n\n\"He claimed bullfights slipped up on this country. Back when it wasn't\nlegal, they spaded up the ground real good. There were movies, and\nbooks, and magazines, and foreign broadcasts, all ravin' about how brave\nand noble it was for a bunch of men to worry and torture a stupid animal\nlike a bull, till he couldn't hardly hold his head up, and then run a\nsword in 'im.\"\n\n\"Naturally, you--\"\n\n\"I don't know how many times he told me a bull had more brains than a\nhorse, but less then a jackass. He said bullfightin' wasn't a sport,\neven if the bull got a man sometimes: and he had the idea the worst\nthing was the four or five horses, that ever' bull killed, took with\n'im. They had some bloodless bullfights in California, and the nut\ncolonies out there like it so good, first thing you know, we really had\nit. It came to East Tennessee 'cause this was one of the biggest\ncattle-raisin' sections, before the Lakes took the grazin' land.\"\n\n\"Surely, Stonecypher, you--\"\n\n\"My father always claimed if the bullfighters were near as brave as they\nsaid, they'd take on a really intelligent animal sometimes, like a\nman-eatin' tiger. He even thought a man was mentalill to fight a bull in\nthe first place.\" Stonecypher grinned. \"No, you don't need to worry\nabout me, ringmaster. I hate to admit it, but the old man is the one who\nwas mentalill.\"\n\nOswell revealed all of his steel teeth in a broad smile. \"You had me\nworried!\" he wheezed. \"Now, your offer.\"\n\n\"I'll go even better,\" Stonecypher said, \"just to show how set I am on\ngettin' back in the business. If Moe's not brave, I got two yearlin's\nyou can have for free.\"\n\n\"How generous! You've reassured me, Stonecypher. I have confidence, now,\nthat the show will be a great success! I must go! You have no conception\nof the life a ringmaster leads before a fight. I won't require a written\nguarantee. I trust you, Stonecypher! See you tomorrow, I hope! I never\nliked July. If the Government would only make more Lakes, it might cool\noff! I hope--\"\n\nThe whir of the red butterflier's wings terminated Oswell's discourse.\nWith a face like a gored bullkiller, Stonecypher watched the\nringmaster's departure. Another butterflier hovered above the mountain.\nThis one was green and gold with the canopy pushed back and a glint of\ntwin lenses in the cockpit.\n\nWill appeared at Stonecypher's side. He spat in a long arc and said,\n\"That's a new one, ain't it, peepin' from a butterfly? I reckon L. Dan\nnever got kilt in that other duel like I hoped he would. You want us to\ngit you outa this, Stonecypher?\"\n\n\"No, Will.\"\n\n\"We can see you git to the Smokies. The Givernment'll never find you\ndown in there.\"\n\n\"I'll be all right, Will. If he does kill me, take care of Catriona. And\nlook after the calf records.\"\n\n\"Sure thang.\"\n\nStonecypher walked slowly toward Catriona's open-topped sunbathing tent.\n\n\n\n\nDANSE MACABRE\n\n\nDuelmaster R. Smith adjusted his black tam. \"Do not touch your shooting\nhand to your weapon until the buzzer sounds,\" he instructed. \"Otherwise,\nthe weapon may be carried as you wish. At the slightest infringement of\nthe rules, a robot gun will kill you. If you have any elaborate last\nwords, say them now; because the pen is soundproof.\" He laughed an\nobviously much rehearsed laugh.\n\nL. Dan wore orange tights today, but no armor, since the rules required\ndeulists to present naked torsos for probable bullets. Stonecypher faced\nthe duelmaster. \"I reckon this room is the only place a man really has\nfree speech,\" he said. \"You're deaf, and can't see good enough to read\nlips, and me or him will soon be dead.\n\n\"I don't believe in this duelin'. It gives a man who's wrong a chance to\nkill one who's right. A man shouldn't oughta have to die because he's\nright. Just like ever'thing else in this Manly Age. It's painful. That\noughta be our motto, More Pain, just like in the Machine Age it was More\nGadgets At Any Cost.\"\n\n\"Why don't you go on tevee?\" Dan jeered. \"She'll soon forget you,\nfarmer.\"\n\nStonecypher's words rolled over the hobbyist. \"I reckon the Manly Age\ncame because a man started thinkin' he wasn't much of a man any more. He\nwas just as fast as his car, and just as strong as his electric lawn\nmower. And a loud minority of the women was claimin' they could do\nanything a man could, and maybe better. So the men started playin'\nfootball in shorts and huntin' each other on game preserves, and the\nwomen went back to the kitchen and bedroom. Lots of things that went on\nundercover come out in the open. Cockfights, dogfights, coon-on-a-log,\nduels, stallion fights, bullfights.\n\n\"And people like you, L. Dan, went on livin'. You got no right to live.\nYou don't do any useful work. The Earth is slowly starvin', and you take\nthe grub out of some feller's mouth who might could help a little.\nThat's why--\"\n\n\"Time!\" announced the duelmaster with his face close to a large clock on\nthe wall. He opened the door. Two men carrying a body on a stretcher\npassed. The body had four bullet wounds in it.\n\nDan said, \"That drivel gives me a real reason to kill you, farmer. I'll\nbe good to her for a few days.\"\n\nAs prearranged, Dan took the right branch of the corridor and\nStonecypher, the left. A hooded man gave Stonecypher the Magnum revolver\nand shut him into a space resembling a windowed closet with a door on\neither side. Stonecypher secured the revolver in the clip holster. His\nbony hands formed knotted fists.\n\nThe pen door slid back. Stonecypher stepped into a room thirty by ninety\nfeet with three bullet-marred concrete walls and a fourth wall of\nbulletproof glass, behind which sat the ghoulish audience. Dan, crouched\nand with his pistol in the crook of his left elbow, advanced. His right\nhand fluttered an inch from the pistol butt.\n\nStonecypher, grotesque with thin chest exposed and overall bib wrapped\naround belt, waited. Two photoelectric robot machine guns followed each\nmovement of the duelists. A buzzer sounded. Dan's index finger failed to\nreach the trigger, for a guardian machine gun removed the hobbyist's\nhead in a short efficient burst. The noise of a louder buzzer punctuated\nthe execution.\n\nWhen the soundproof inner door of the closet opened, the hooded man, who\nhad a pair of crossed pistols tattooed on the back of his right hand,\nsaid, \"He was too anxious.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Stonecypher grunted.\n\nThe man watched Stonecypher pass out to the street. Stonecypher snapped\nup the bib of his overalls. An extremely rare bird, a robin, hopped from\nhis path and continued a fruitless search for insects. Stonecypher\nwalked down Watauga Street until the pavement vanished under the\nbrownish-green water of Kings Lake.\n\nCatriona squealed when she saw him. Ignoring all Correct Procedures, she\nalmost knocked him down and attempted to smother him. \"Ah told you it\njust took practice!\" she blubbered. \"You did it, Stony!\"\n\nWith muffled mumbles, Stonecypher managed to put her in the Tenite\ncanoe. The few people along the quay, who had witnessed the illegal\nmanner of their meeting, watched with shock, or with incredulity, or\nwith guarded admiration. When they saw that Stonecypher's hand rested on\na holstered revolver, they lost their curiosity.\n\nWading, Stonecypher shoved the canoe off and hopped aboard. As he took\nup the paddle, his hand trailed in the water and released the small\nbuzzer that had made possible Catriona's best carnival act.\n\n\n\nFor July, the afternoon was cool. Blue-gray clouds drifted before larger\ndirty white masses. To the southwest opened the mile-wide mouth of Horse\nCreek; and, far beyond, the great blue pyramid of Chimney Top Mountain\nstood defiantly above Sevier Lake. The world seemed water broken only by\npartly submerged hills and mountains.\n\nStonecypher gazed across the Lake at Bays Mountain and at the five\nCement Islands apparently floating against that backdrop. Softly, he\nsaid, \"Some folks call the big one Martyrs Island. There's a marble\npillar right in the middle. Nobody knows who put it there, and the\nGovernment never bothered to knock it down. I reckon the poison ivy's\ncovered it by now, but I went and read the inscription, once, when I was\na boy. It says:\n\n    \"They moved me off the Powell River.\n    They covered my farm with water.\n    I bought me another near Beans Station.\n    The water covered it.\n    I was getting old, but I built at Galloway Mill.\n    When they flooded that, I gave up and lived in Kingsport.\n    I will not move again.\"\n\nThe canoe bounded over the choppy water, one hundred feet above the\nsilted streets of the flooded city of Kingsport. Stonecypher said, \"The\ntime I was there, you could still find a few copter-trooper helmets and\nold cankered shells. Couple of years back, a diver brought up two skulls\noff shore.\"\n\nCatriona's eyes remained moist, but she smiled. Her teeth were\nbeautiful. \"It'll be all rahght, Stony. You can't change the wo'ld in\none day. You did fine, and Moe will too.\"\n\n\"I told you to stay at the bullring,\" Stonecypher said.\n\n\"Ah couldn't watch that! And those puny, little, mousy women stare and\ntalk about me, because theah's a little meat on mah cahcass. Oswell said\nMoe would be last, anyhow. Ah was so wo'ied about you, ah couldn't sit\nstill.\"\n\nOnly a few boats, mainly those of piscatorial maniacs, were on the lake.\nStonecypher glared at them and muttered, \"I hope I did right by Moe. He\nwanted to fight. Maybe, Catriona, if I'd had you when I found out he\ncould talk--not just mimic--I'd of raised him different. Maybe I\nshouldn't have shown him that bullfight movie, but I wondered what the\nonly bull to see a bullfight from outside the ring thought about it.\n\n\"That led him to wantin' to know all about the Man-Animal War. I told\nhim the best I could, how one of a man's basic drives is to exterminate,\never' since prehistoric times when he did in the wooly mammoth and\nrhinoceros. The dodo, quagga, passenger pigeon, great auk, aurochs, Key\ndeer, bison, African elephant, gorilla, tiger--there's an awful list.\nWhy, five hundred species of mammals, alone, have become extinct since 1\nA.D., 'bout four hundred of them since 1850. A man'll even kill off\nother men, like the Neanderthals and the Tasmanians!\" Stonecypher rested\nthe paddle and grinned, faintly, at Catriona reclining in the bow. \"I\nguess you've heard this before.\"\n\n\"Go rahght ahead, Stony,\" Catriona sighed. \"Ah like to heah yoah speech.\nIt's the only time you really get angry, and you look so fine and\nnoble.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Well. I told Moe how a man exterminates useful or harmless\nspecies, and then he lets dangerous ones, like rats, eat him out of\nhouse and home. Course, I explained this was just kinship. Folks used to\nargue man come from a monkey, or from spontaneous combustion, or\nsomething. Now we got fossil proof he's not like anything anybody ever\nsaw. He's a case of straight line development all the way back to the\nfirst mammal, a sort of rat.\"\n\nThe canoe glided past Highland Pier. Every type of small watercraft,\nfrom a punt, through an electric motorboat, to a sloop, had docked. More\nboats lined the shore on either side of the pier. The flying field\ncontained so many butterfliers and copters that there seemed no\npossibility of any of them taking off. Human voices welled in a mob roar\nfrom the great open cylinder of the bullring. A huge banner draped on\nthe curving white wall proclaimed, in ten-foot letters:\n\n        DEPENDENCE DAY\n          BULLFIGHT\n        HONOR THE GREAT\n      GOVERNMENT ON WHICH\n          WE DEPEND\n    SIX BULLS--THREE KILLERS\n\nStonecypher ran the canoe aground in a patch of dead weeds, exposed by a\nslight lowering of the lake level, and helped Catriona over the rocks\nthat lined the bank. He said, \"I told Moe other things men do to\nanimals. All the laboratory butchery, done because it would be cruel to\ntreat a man like that, but it's all right with a animal, like takin' out\na dog's brains and lettin' 'im live. I told him about huntin', how the\nkudu become extinct 'cause a bunch of fools wanted to see who could kill\nthe one with the biggest horns.\n\n\"I told him the things done to domestic animals. Dehornin',\nemasculatin', brandin', slaughterin' with sledge hammers and butcher\nknives, keepin' 'em in filthy barns. A man tells hisself he's superior\nto other animals. If he does somethin' bad, he uses words like inhuman,\nbrutal, animal instincts, instead of admittin' it's just typical\nbehavior. And the psychologists take some animal, say a dog, and put him\nin a maze, something the dog never saw before. If the dog don't run the\nmaze in two seconds flat, they say he's a pretty stupid animal. He just\noperates on instinct, but they can't say how instinct operates. They'll\nhave a time explainin' Moe's instincts.\n\n\"I reckon the American bison made Moe madder than anything. They killed\nthe bison off, 'cept for protected herds, in the Nineteenth Century. A\nhundred years later, the herds had got pretty big, so they declared open\nseason on bison. No more bison.\"\n\nA recorded voice growled, \"No guns permitted in ring. Deposit gun in\nslot. No guns permitted in ring.\"\n\nStonecypher moved his permit in ineffectual passes before the electric\neye. He shrugged, dropped the revolver into the slot, and left his thumb\nprint. Catriona displayed the passes Ringmaster Oswell had given them.\nThe teveer blinked, and the gate granted admission. They rode the\nescalator to the sixth tier and squirmed through pandemonium to their\nseats.\n\nThe male portion of the crowd wore every possible style and color of\ndress, in complete emancipation from the old business suit uniform, but\nthe women wore sober false-bosomed sundresses and expressed excitement\nin polite chirps. Stonecypher pressed his mouth against Catriona's ear\nand whispered through the din, \"You got to understand, Cat, whatever\nhappens, Moe wanted it. He says he can scare some killers into givin' up\nbullfights and maybe help stop it.\"\n\n\"He'll do fine, Stony.\"\n\nSeveral spectators stopped venting their wrath on the unfortunate man in\nthe ring to gawk at the couple. Catriona's unorthodox physique aroused\nsufficient amazement; but, in addition, Stonecypher gave her the front\nseat and took the rear one, the correct place for a woman, himself.\n\nBelow, through a rain of plastibottles and rotten eggs, a tired man\nwalked to the barrier which Oswell advertised as the only wooden fence\nin seven states. Behind the killer, a small electric tractor dragged out\nthe bloody carcass of a bull.\n\nA gasping, gibbering little man grabbed Stonecypher's arm and yelped,\n\"Illard is the clumsiest killer, he ran the sword in three times, and\nthe kid with the dagger had to stick twice before they finished, Big\nDependence Day Bullfight my jet! This is the worst in years, Fergus made\nthe only clean kill all afternoon, and I flew every one of eighteen\nhundred miles myself to see it, this last bull better be good!\" The\nlittle man waved his bag of rotten eggs.\n\nAlthough the bullfight followed the basic procedures established by\nFrancisco Romero in the Spain of 1700, changes had occurred, including\nthe elimination of all Spanish words from the vocabulary of the\nspectacle since the unpleasant dispute with the Spanish Empire twenty\nyears before. The gaudy costumes worn by participants had been replaced\nby trunks and sneakers.\n\nA purring grader smoothed the sand. The crowd quieted, except for those\nnear the box of Ringmaster Oswell. They suggested in obscene terms that\ntheir money be refunded. A trumpet recording blared. A scarlet door,\ninscribed, \"Moe of Bays Mountain Farm,\" opened. The crowd awaited the\nfirst wild rush of the bull. It failed to materialize.\n\n\n\n\nGRAND FINALE\n\n\nSlowly, Moe came through the doorway. Above, on a platform inside the\nbarrier, stood a gray-haired man who stuck identifying, streamered darts\ninto bovine shoulders. His hand swept down, carrying Stonecypher's\nchosen colors, black.\n\nMoe's walk upset the man's timing. His arm moved too soon. Moe's front\nhooves left the ground. Horns hooked. The gray-haired man screamed and\ndropped the dart. With a spike of horn through his arm, between bone and\nbiceps, he gyrated across the barrier. He screamed a second time before\ncloven hooves slashed across his body.\n\nThe crowd inhaled, then cheered the unprecedented entrance. Killer\nFergus's team stood rigid, not comprehending. Then men dashed through\nshielded openings in the barrier, yelling and waving pink and yellow\ncapes to draw the bull from his victim.\n\nMoe ignored the distraction, trotted nonchalantly to the center of the\nring, and turned his bulging head to examine the spectators jabbering at\nhis strange appearance. The short horns, the round skull, the\nwhite-banded eyes, the mane that seemed slightly purple under the cloudy\nsky, and the exaggerated slope from neck to rump that made the hind legs\ntoo short--together they amounted to a ton of muscle almost like a bull.\n\"Where'd you trap it, Oswell?\" someone near the ringmaster's box yelled.\n\nForgetting the mess Illard had made with the previous bull, the crowd\ncommented. \"It's the last of the bison!\"\n\n\"He's poiple! Lookit! Poiple!\"\n\n\"The bull of the woods!\"\n\n\"Howya like 'im, Fergus?\"\n\nKiller Fergus posed behind the barrier and studied his specialty, an odd\nbull. Two stickers, Neel and Tomas, flourished capes to test the bull's\ncharge, with Neel chanting, \"Come on, bull! Come on, bull! Come on!\nBull, bull, bull!\"\n\nMoe did not charge. He moved, in a speculative walk, toward the chanting\nNeel who tantalized with the cape and retreated with shuffling steps.\nThe charge, when it came, occurred almost too fast for sight. Neel\nwriggled on the horns, struck the sand, and the horns lifted him again.\nHe smashed against the barrier. Tomas threw his cape over the bull's\nface. The left horn pinned the cape to Tomas's naked chest over the\nheart.\n\nMoe retired to the center of the ring and bellowed at the crowd, which,\ndelirious from seeing human blood, applauded. Blood covered Moe's horns,\ndripped through the long hair on his neck, and trickled down between his\neyes.\n\nQuavering helpers removed the bodies. The first lancer, livid and\ntrembling, rode a blindfolded horse into the ring. \"He'll fix this\nhorse!\" the crowd slavered. \"We'll see guts this time!\"\n\nMoe charged. The lancer backed his mount against the barrier and gripped\nhis weapon, a stout pike. Sand sprayed like water as Moe swerved. On the\nleft side of the horse, away from the menacing pike, Moe reared. The\nlancer left the saddle. A tangle of naked limbs thrashed across the\nwooden fence and thudded against the wall of the stands.\n\nTwenty-five thousand people held their breaths. The blindfolded horse\nwaited with dilated nostrils and every muscle vibrating in terror. Moe\nproduced a long red tongue and licked the horse's jaw.\n\nFergus dispersed the tableau. Red-haired, lean, and scarred with many\npast gorings, the popular killer stalked across the sand dragging his\ncape and roaring incomprehensible challenges. In the stands, the cheer\nleaders of the Fergus Fanclub lead a welcoming yell. \"Yeaaaa, Fergus!\nFergus! Fergus! Rah, rah, rah!\"\n\nMoe wandered through the helpers trying to distract him from the horse\nand looked at the killer. Fergus stamped his foot, shook the cape, and\ncalled, \"Bull! Come on! Charge!\" Moe completely circled the killer, who\nretired in disgust when another lancer rode into the ring. \"Stick him\ngood!\" Fergus directed.\n\nThe pike pointed at the great muscles of Moe's back, as the bull\ncharged. Moe's head twisted in a blur of violence. Teeth clamped on the\nshaft behind the point. Too surprised to let go, the lancer followed his\nweapon from the saddle. He released his hold when Moe walked on him.\n\nLike some fantastic dog stealing a fresh bone, the bull trotted around\nthe ring, tail high and pike in mouth. The crowd laughed. Wild-eyed men\ncarried out the trampled lancer.\n\nA third, and extremely reluctant, lancer reined his horse through the\ngate. A pike in the mouth of a ton of beef utterly unnerved the man. He\nstood in the saddle and jumped over the barrier where a rain of rotten\neggs from the booing fans spattered him thoroughly.\n\n\n\nAn uninjured bull pawed alone in the sand when the trumpet recording\nannounced the end of the lancers' period. The crowd noises softened to a\nbuzz of speculation, questions, and comment, as the realization that\nweird events had been witnessed slowly penetrated that collective mind.\nThe bull had not touched a horse, no pike had jabbed the bull, and five\nmen had been killed or injured.\n\n\"Great Government!\" a clear voice swore, \"That ain't no bull, it's a\nmonster!\" This opinion came from a sticker in Illard's team. Fergus\nattempted to persuade the man to help, since both of Fergus's stickers\nwere dead. Part of the crowd agreed with the sticker's thought, for\npeople began moving furtively to the exits with cautious glances at the\nanimal in the ring. They, of course, could not know that the bull had\nbeen trained, with rubber-tipped pikes and dummies, in every phase of\nthe bullfight; that he knew the first, and only, law of staying alive in\nthe ring, \"Charge the man and not the cloth.\"\n\nThe clouds that had obscured the sky all day formed darker masses tinted\nwith pink to the east, and the black dot of a turkey buzzard wheeled\nsoaring in the gloom. Carrying, in either hand, a barbed stick sparkling\nwith plastic streamers, Fergus walked into the ring. His assistants\ncautiously flanked him with capes.\n\nMoe dropped the pike and charged in the approved manner of a bull.\nFergus raised the sticks high and brought them down on the humped back,\nalthough the back was not there. The sticks dropped in the sand.\n\nAs the killer leaped aside in the completion of a reflex action, a horn\npenetrated the seat of his trunks. The Fergus Fanclub screamed while\ntheir hero dangled in ignominy from the horn. Moe ignored the flapping,\nfrantic capes. The killer gingerly gripped a horn in either hand and\ntried to lift himself off. Gently, Moe lowered his head and deposited\nthe man beside an opening. Fergus scrabbled to safety like a rat to a\nhole.\n\nFour helpers with capes occupied the ring. When they saw death\napproaching on cloven hooves, two of them cleared the fence. The third\nreceived a horn beside his backbone and tumbled into the fourth. A dual\nscream, terrible enough to insure future nightmares, echoed above the\nscreeching of the crowd. Moe tossed the bodies again and again across\nthe bloody sand.\n\nSilence slithered over the Highland Bullring and over a scene\nreminiscent of the ring's bloody parent, the Roman Arena. Men sprawled\ngored, crushed, and dead across the sand. A section of the blood-specked\nbarrier leaned splintered and cracked, almost touching the concrete\nwall. Unharmed, Fergus stood on one side of the battleground, Illard on\nthe other.\n\nFergus reached over the wooden fence for red flag and sword. Turning his\nback on the heaving Moe, who stood but ten feet behind, the killer faced\nthe quaking flesh that was Ringmaster Oswell, high up in the official\nbox. The killer's voice shook, but the bitter satire came through the\nsound of departing boats and aircraft. Fergus said, \"I dedicate this\nbull to Ringmaster Oswell who has provided for us this great Dependence\nDay Bullfight in honor of the Great Government on which we all depend.\"\nHe turned and faced the bull.\n\nMoe, for once, rushed the red flag, the only thing that made bullfights\npossible. His great shoulders presented a fair target for the sword.\n\nFergus, perhaps the only bull-fighter ever to be gored in the brain,\ndied silently. The sword raked a shallow gash long Moe's loin.\n\nIn the sixth tier of the stands, saliva drooled from the slack mouth of\nthe little man seated beside Stonecypher. \"Now's your chance, Illard!\"\nthe man squalled. \"Be a hero! The last of the bullfighters! Kill him,\nIllard!\"\n\nIllard walked on shaking legs over bodies he did not see. He was short,\nfor a killer, and growing bald. He picked up the sword Fergus had\ndropped, looked into the gory face of the bull, and toppled in the\nsticky sand. The sword quivered point-first beside his body.\n\n\n\n\nRECESSIONAL\n\n\nA wind whipped down into Highland Bullring. Riding the wind, blacker\nthan the clouds, the inquisitive turkey buzzard glided over the rim of\nthe stands with air whistling through the spatulate feathers of rigid\nwings. The buzzard swooped a foot above Moe's horns and soared swiftly\nover the opposite side of the ring.\n\nThat started the panic, although Moe's charge accentuated it. He crashed\ninto the sagging section of the barrier. Cloven hooves scraped the\nwooden inclined plane, and Moe stopped with front feet in the first tier\nof the stands. He bellowed.\n\nThe bull killed only one spectator, a man on whom he stepped. The\nhundreds who died killed themselves or each other. They leaped from the\ntowering rim of the ring, and they jammed the exits in writhing heaps.\n\nMoe's precarious stance slipped. Slowly, he slid back into the ring,\nwhere Ringmaster Oswell, quivering in a red toga, gestured from the\ndarkness under the stands. The fat man squeaked and waved. Moe's charge\nembodied the genuine fighting rage of a maddened bull. The scarlet door\nclosed behind him.\n\nStonecypher, with fists bloody and a heap of unconscious fear-crazed\nspectators piled before him, sat down. \"Well, Moe,\" he whispered, \"I\nreckon you got even for a few of the bulls that's been tortured to death\nto amuse a bunch of nuts. Maybe it wasn't the right way to do it. I\ndon't know. If I'd only had the gun--\"\n\nCatriona turned a white mask of a face up to Stonecypher. \"They killed\nhim, in theah?\"\n\n\"Sure. Bullfightin' never was a sport. The bull can't win. If he's not\nkilled in the ring, he's slaughtered under the stands.\"\n\n\"You have moah smart-bulls, Stony.\"\n\nThe black copter came in with the sunset and hovered over the sand. The\nface of Duelmaster Smith peered out under his black tam, while a hooded\nman, with pistols tattooed on his hand, aimed an automatic rifle. The\nduelmaster smiled at Stonecypher and cried, \"You really should have\nwaited until you were farther out in the Lake, before you dropped that\nlittle buzzer in the water.\"",
