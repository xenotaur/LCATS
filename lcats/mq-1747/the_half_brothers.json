    "body": "by Elizabeth Gaskell\n\n\n\n\nMy mother was twice married. She never spoke of her first husband, and\nit is only from other people that I have learnt what little I know\nabout him. I believe she was scarcely seventeen when she was married to\nhim: and he was barely one-and-twenty. He rented a small farm up in\nCumberland, somewhere towards the sea-coast; but he was perhaps too\nyoung and inexperienced to have the charge of land and cattle: anyhow,\nhis affairs did not prosper, and he fell into ill health, and died of\nconsumption before they had been three years man and wife, leaving my\nmother a young widow of twenty, with a little child only just able to\nwalk, and the farm on her hands for four years more by the lease, with\nhalf the stock on it dead, or sold off one by one to pay the more\npressing debts, and with no money to purchase more, or even to buy the\nprovisions needed for the small consumption of every day. There was\nanother child coming, too; and sad and sorry, I believe, she was to\nthink of it. A dreary winter she must have had in her lonesome\ndwelling, with never another near it for miles around; her sister came\nto bear her company, and they two planned and plotted how to make every\npenny they could raise go as far as possible. I can\u2019t tell you how it\nhappened that my little sister, whom I never saw, came to sicken and\ndie; but, as if my poor mother\u2019s cup was not full enough, only a\nfortnight before Gregory was born the little girl took ill of scarlet\nfever, and in a week she lay dead. My mother was, I believe, just\nstunned with this last blow. My aunt has told me that she did not cry;\naunt Fanny would have been thankful if she had; but she sat holding the\npoor wee lassie\u2019s hand and looking in her pretty, pale, dead face,\nwithout so much as shedding a tear. And it was all the same, when they\nhad to take her away to be buried. She just kissed the child, and sat\nher down in the window-seat to watch the little black train of people\n(neighbours\u2014my aunt, and one far-off cousin, who were all the friends\nthey could muster) go winding away amongst the snow, which had fallen\nthinly over the country the night before. When my aunt came back from\nthe funeral, she found my mother in the same place, and as dry-eyed as\never. So she continued until after Gregory was born; and, somehow, his\ncoming seemed to loosen the tears, and she cried day and night, till my\naunt and the other watcher looked at each other in dismay, and would\nfain have stopped her if they had but known how. But she bade them let\nher alone, and not be over-anxious, for every drop she shed eased her\nbrain, which had been in a terrible state before for want of the power\nto cry. She seemed after that to think of nothing but her new little\nbaby; she had hardly appeared to remember either her husband or her\nlittle daughter that lay dead in Brigham churchyard\u2014at least so aunt\nFanny said, but she was a great talker, and my mother was very silent\nby nature, and I think aunt Fanny may have been mistaken in believing\nthat my mother never thought of her husband and child just because she\nnever spoke about them. Aunt Fanny was older than my mother, and had a\nway of treating her like a child; but, for all that, she was a kind,\nwarm-hearted creature, who thought more of her sister\u2019s welfare than\nshe did of her own and it was on her bit of money that they principally\nlived, and on what the two could earn by working for the great Glasgow\nsewing-merchants. But by-and-by my mother\u2019s eye-sight began to fail. It\nwas not that she was exactly blind, for she could see well enough to\nguide herself about the house, and to do a good deal of domestic work;\nbut she could no longer do fine sewing and earn money. It must have\nbeen with the heavy crying she had had in her day, for she was but a\nyoung creature at this time, and as pretty a young woman, I have heard\npeople say, as any on the country side. She took it sadly to heart that\nshe could no longer gain anything towards the keep of herself and her\nchild. My aunt Fanny would fain have persuaded her that she had enough\nto do in managing their cottage and minding Gregory; but my mother knew\nthat they were pinched, and that aunt Fanny herself had not as much to\neat, even of the commonest kind of food, as she could have done with;\nand as for Gregory, he was not a strong lad, and needed, not more\nfood\u2014for he always had enough, whoever went short\u2014but better\nnourishment, and more flesh-meat. One day\u2014it was aunt Fanny who told me\nall this about my poor mother, long after her death\u2014as the sisters were\nsitting together, aunt Fanny working, and my mother hushing Gregory to\nsleep, William Preston, who was afterwards my father, came in. He was\nreckoned an old bachelor; I suppose he was long past forty, and he was\none of the wealthiest farmers thereabouts, and had known my grandfather\nwell, and my mother and my aunt in their more prosperous days. He sat\ndown, and began to twirl his hat by way of being agreeable; my aunt\nFanny talked, and he listened and looked at my mother. But he said very\nlittle, either on that visit, or on many another that he paid before he\nspoke out what had been the real purpose of his calling so often all\nalong, and from the very first time he came to their house. One Sunday,\nhowever, my aunt Fanny stayed away from church, and took care of the\nchild, and my mother went alone. When she came back, she ran straight\nupstairs, without going into the kitchen to look at Gregory or speak\nany word to her sister, and aunt Fanny heard her cry as if her heart\nwas breaking; so she went up and scolded her right well through the\nbolted door, till at last she got her to open it. And then she threw\nherself on my aunt\u2019s neck, and told her that William Preston had asked\nher to marry him, and had promised to take good charge of her boy, and\nto let him want for nothing, neither in the way of keep nor of\neducation, and that she had consented. Aunt Fanny was a good deal\nshocked at this; for, as I have said, she had often thought that my\nmother had forgotten her first husband very quickly, and now here was\nproof positive of it, if she could so soon think of marrying again.\nBesides as aunt Fanny used to say, she herself would have been a far\nmore suitable match for a man of William Preston\u2019s age than Helen, who,\nthough she was a widow, had not seen her four-and-twentieth summer.\nHowever, as aunt Fanny said, they had not asked her advice; and there\nwas much to be said on the other side of the question. Helen\u2019s eyesight\nwould never be good for much again, and as William Preston\u2019s wife she\nwould never need to do anything, if she chose to sit with her hands\nbefore her; and a boy was a great charge to a widowed mother; and now\nthere would be a decent steady man to see after him. So, by-and-by,\naunt Fanny seemed to take a brighter view of the marriage than did my\nmother herself, who hardly ever looked up, and never smiled after the\nday when she promised William Preston to be his wife. But much as she\nhad loved Gregory before, she seemed to love him more now. She was\ncontinually talking to him when they were alone, though he was far too\nyoung to understand her moaning words, or give her any comfort, except\nby his caresses.\n\nAt last William Preston and she were wed; and she went to be mistress\nof a well-stocked house, not above half-an-hour\u2019s walk from where aunt\nFanny lived. I believe she did all that she could to please my father;\nand a more dutiful wife, I have heard him himself say, could never have\nbeen. But she did not love him, and he soon found it out. She loved\nGregory, and she did not love him. Perhaps, love would have come in\ntime, if he had been patient enough to wait; but it just turned him\nsour to see how her eye brightened and her colour came at the sight of\nthat little child, while for him who had given her so much, she had\nonly gentle words as cold as ice. He got to taunt her with the\ndifference in her manner, as if that would bring love: and he took a\npositive dislike to Gregory,\u2014he was so jealous of the ready love that\nalways gushed out like a spring of fresh water when he came near. He\nwanted her to love him more, and perhaps that was all well and good;\nbut he wanted her to love her child less, and that was an evil wish.\nOne day, he gave way to his temper, and cursed and swore at Gregory,\nwho had got into some mischief, as children will; my mother made some\nexcuse for him; my father said it was hard enough to have to keep\nanother man\u2019s child, without having it perpetually held up in its\nnaughtiness by his wife, who ought to be always in the same mind that\nhe was; and so from little they got to more; and the end of it was,\nthat my mother took to her bed before her time, and I was born that\nvery day. My father was glad, and proud, and sorry, all in a breath;\nglad and proud that a son was born to him; and sorry for his poor\nwife\u2019s state, and to think how his angry words had brought it on. But\nhe was a man who liked better to be angry than sorry, so he soon found\nout that it was all Gregory\u2019s fault, and owed him an additional grudge\nfor having hastened my birth. He had another grudge against him before\nlong. My mother began to sink the day after I was born. My father sent\nto Carlisle for doctors, and would have coined his heart\u2019s blood into\ngold to save her, if that could have been; but it could not. My aunt\nFanny used to say sometimes, that she thought that Helen did not wish\nto live, and so just let herself die away without trying to take hold\non life; but when I questioned her, she owned that my mother did all\nthe doctors bade her do, with the same sort of uncomplaining patience\nwith which she had acted through life. One of her last requests was to\nhave Gregory laid in her bed by my side, and then she made him take\nhold of my little hand. Her husband came in while she was looking at us\nso, and when he bent tenderly over her to ask her how she felt now, and\nseemed to gaze on us two little half-brothers, with a grave sort of\nkindness, she looked up in his face and smiled, almost her first smile\nat him; and such a sweet smile! as more besides aunt Fanny have said.\nIn an hour she was dead. Aunt Fanny came to live with us. It was the\nbest thing that could be done. My father would have been glad to return\nto his old mode of bachelor life, but what could he do with two little\nchildren? He needed a woman to take care of him, and who so fitting as\nhis wife\u2019s elder sister? So she had the charge of me from my birth; and\nfor a time I was weakly, as was but natural, and she was always beside\nme, night and day watching over me, and my father nearly as anxious as\nshe. For his land had come down from father to son for more than three\nhundred years, and he would have cared for me merely as his flesh and\nblood that was to inherit the land after him. But he needed something\nto love, for all that, to most people, he was a stern, hard man, and he\ntook to me as, I fancy, he had taken to no human being before\u2014as he\nmight have taken to my mother, if she had had no former life for him to\nbe jealous of. I loved him back again right heartily. I loved all\naround me, I believe, for everybody was kind to me. After a time, I\novercame my original weakness of constitution, and was just a bonny,\nstrong-looking lad whom every passer-by noticed, when my father took me\nwith him to the nearest town.\n\nAt home I was the darling of my aunt, the tenderly-beloved of my\nfather, the pet and plaything of the old domestics, the \u201cyoung master\u201d\nof the farm-labourers, before whom I played many a lordly antic,\nassuming a sort of authority which sat oddly enough, I doubt not, on\nsuch a baby as I was.\n\nGregory was three years older than I. Aunt Fanny was always kind to him\nin deed and in action, but she did not often think about him, she had\nfallen so completely into the habit of being engrossed by me, from the\nfact of my having come into her charge as a delicate baby. My father\nnever got over his grudging dislike to his stepson, who had so\ninnocently wrestled with him for the possession of my mother\u2019s heart. I\nmistrust me, too, that my father always considered him as the cause of\nmy mother\u2019s death and my early delicacy; and utterly unreasonable as\nthis may seem, I believe my father rather cherished his feeling of\nalienation to my brother as a duty, than strove to repress it. Yet not\nfor the world would my father have grudged him anything that money\ncould purchase. That was, as it were, in the bond when he had wedded my\nmother. Gregory was lumpish and loutish, awkward and ungainly, marring\nwhatever he meddled in, and many a hard word and sharp scolding did he\nget from the people about the farm, who hardly waited till my father\u2019s\nback was turned before they rated the stepson. I am ashamed\u2014my heart is\nsore to think how I fell into the fashion of the family, and slighted\nmy poor orphan step-brother. I don\u2019t think I ever scouted him, or was\nwilfully ill-natured to him; but the habit of being considered in all\nthings, and being treated as something uncommon and superior, made me\ninsolent in my prosperity, and I exacted more than Gregory was always\nwilling to grant, and then, irritated, I sometimes repeated the\ndisparaging words I had heard others use with regard to him, without\nfully understanding their meaning. Whether he did or not I cannot tell.\nI am afraid he did. He used to turn silent and quiet\u2014sullen and sulky,\nmy father thought it: stupid, aunt Fanny used to call it. But every one\nsaid he was stupid and dull, and this stupidity and dullness grew upon\nhim. He would sit without speaking a word, sometimes, for hours; then\nmy father would bid him rise and do some piece of work, maybe, about\nthe farm. And he would take three or four tellings before he would go.\nWhen we were sent to school, it was all the same. He could never be\nmade to remember his lessons; the school-master grew weary of scolding\nand flogging, and at last advised my father just to take him away, and\nset him to some farm-work that might not be above his comprehension. I\nthink he was more gloomy and stupid than ever after this, yet he was\nnot a cross lad; he was patient and good-natured, and would try to do a\nkind turn for any one, even if they had been scolding or cuffing him\nnot a minute before. But very often his attempts at kindness ended in\nsome mischief to the very people he was trying to serve, owing to his\nawkward, ungainly ways. I suppose I was a clever lad; at any rate, I\nalways got plenty of praise; and was, as we called it, the cock of the\nschool. The schoolmaster said I could learn anything I chose, but my\nfather, who had no great learning himself, saw little use in much for\nme, and took me away betimes, and kept me with him about the farm.\nGregory was made into a kind of shepherd, receiving his training under\nold Adam, who was nearly past his work. I think old Adam was almost the\nfirst person who had a good opinion of Gregory. He stood to it that my\nbrother had good parts, though he did not rightly know how to bring\nthem out; and, for knowing the bearings of the Fells, he said he had\nnever seen a lad like him. My father would try to bring Adam round to\nspeak of Gregory\u2019s faults and shortcomings; but, instead of that, he\nwould praise him twice as much, as soon as he found out what was my\nfather\u2019s object.\n\nOne winter-time, when I was about sixteen, and Gregory nineteen, I was\nsent by my father on an errand to a place about seven miles distant by\nthe road, but only about four by the Fells. He bade me return by the\nroad, whichever way I took in going, for the evenings closed in early,\nand were often thick and misty; besides which, old Adam, now paralytic\nand bedridden, foretold a downfall of snow before long. I soon got to\nmy journey\u2019s end, and soon had done my business; earlier by an hour, I\nthought, than my father had expected, so I took the decision of the way\nby which I would return into my own hands, and set off back again over\nthe Fells, just as the first shades of evening began to fall. It looked\ndark and gloomy enough; but everything was so still that I thought I\nshould have plenty of time to get home before the snow came down. Off I\nset at a pretty quick pace. But night came on quicker. The right path\nwas clear enough in the day-time, although at several points two or\nthree exactly similar diverged from the same place; but when there was\na good light, the traveller was guided by the sight of distant\nobjects,\u2014a piece of rock,\u2014a fall in the ground\u2014which were quite\ninvisible to me now. I plucked up a brave heart, however, and took what\nseemed to me the right road. It was wrong, nevertheless, and led me\nwhither I knew not, but to some wild boggy moor where the solitude\nseemed painful, intense, as if never footfall of man had come thither\nto break the silence. I tried to shout\u2014with the dimmest possible hope\nof being heard\u2014rather to reassure myself by the sound of my own voice;\nbut my voice came husky and short, and yet it dismayed me; it seemed so\nweird and strange, in that noiseless expanse of black darkness.\nSuddenly the air was filled thick with dusky flakes, my face and hands\nwere wet with snow. It cut me off from the slightest knowledge of where\nI was, for I lost every idea of the direction from which I had come, so\nthat I could not even retrace my steps; it hemmed me in, thicker,\nthicker, with a darkness that might be felt. The boggy soil on which I\nstood quaked under me if I remained long in one place, and yet I dared\nnot move far. All my youthful hardiness seemed to leave me at once. I\nwas on the point of crying, and only very shame seemed to keep it down.\nTo save myself from shedding tears, I shouted\u2014terrible, wild shouts for\nbare life they were. I turned sick as I paused to listen; no answering\nsound came but the unfeeling echoes. Only the noiseless, pitiless snow\nkept falling thicker, thicker\u2014faster, faster! I was growing numb and\nsleepy. I tried to move about, but I dared not go far, for fear of the\nprecipices which, I knew, abounded in certain places on the Fells. Now\nand then, I stood still and shouted again; but my voice was getting\nchoked with tears, as I thought of the desolate helpless death I was to\ndie, and how little they at home, sitting round the warm, red, bright\nfire, wotted what was become of me,\u2014and how my poor father would grieve\nfor me\u2014it would surely kill him\u2014it would break his heart, poor old man!\nAunt Fanny too\u2014was this to be the end of all her cares for me? I began\nto review my life in a strange kind of vivid dream, in which the\nvarious scenes of my few boyish years passed before me like visions. In\na pang of agony, caused by such remembrance of my short life, I\ngathered up my strength and called out once more, a long, despairing,\nwailing cry, to which I had no hope of obtaining any answer, save from\nthe echoes around, dulled as the sound might be by the thickened air.\nTo my surprise I heard a cry\u2014almost as long, as wild as mine\u2014so wild\nthat it seemed unearthly, and I almost thought it must be the voice of\nsome of the mocking spirits of the Fells, about whom I had heard so\nmany tales. My heart suddenly began to beat fast and loud. I could not\nreply for a minute or two. I nearly fancied I had lost the power of\nutterance. Just at this moment a dog barked. Was it Lassie\u2019s bark\u2014my\nbrother\u2019s collie?\u2014an ugly enough brute, with a white, ill-looking face,\nthat my father always kicked whenever he saw it, partly for its own\ndemerits, partly because it belonged to my brother. On such occasions,\nGregory would whistle Lassie away, and go off and sit with her in some\nouthouse. My father had once or twice been ashamed of himself, when the\npoor collie had yowled out with the suddenness of the pain, and had\nrelieved himself of his self-reproach by blaming my brother, who, he\nsaid, had no notion of training a dog, and was enough to ruin any\ncollie in Christendom with his stupid way of allowing them to lie by\nthe kitchen fire. To all which Gregory would answer nothing, nor even\nseem to hear, but go on looking absent and moody.\n\nYes! there again! It was Lassie\u2019s bark! Now or never! I lifted up my\nvoice and shouted \u201cLassie! Lassie! for God\u2019s sake, Lassie!\u201d Another\nmoment, and the great white-faced Lassie was curving and gambolling\nwith delight round my feet and legs, looking, however, up in my face\nwith her intelligent, apprehensive eyes, as if fearing lest I might\ngreet her with a blow, as I had done oftentimes before. But I cried\nwith gladness, as I stooped down and patted her. My mind was sharing in\nmy body\u2019s weakness, and I could not reason, but I knew that help was at\nhand. A gray figure came more and more distinctly out of the thick,\nclose-pressing darkness. It was Gregory wrapped in his maud.\n\n\u201cOh, Gregory!\u201d said I, and I fell upon his neck, unable to speak\nanother word. He never spoke much, and made me no answer for some\nlittle time. Then he told me we must move, we must walk for the dear\nlife\u2014we must find our road home, if possible; but we must move, or we\nshould be frozen to death.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know the way home?\u201d asked I.\n\n\u201cI thought I did when I set out, but I am doubtful now. The snow blinds\nme, and I am feared that in moving about just now, I have lost the\nright gait homewards.\u201d\n\nHe had his shepherd\u2019s staff with him, and by dint of plunging it before\nus at every step we took\u2014clinging close to each other, we went on\nsafely enough, as far as not falling down any of the steep rocks, but\nit was slow, dreary work. My brother, I saw, was more guided by Lassie\nand the way she took than anything else, trusting to her instinct. It\nwas too dark to see far before us; but he called her back continually,\nand noted from what quarter she returned, and shaped our slow steps\naccordingly. But the tedious motion scarcely kept my very blood from\nfreezing. Every bone, every fibre in my body seemed first to ache, and\nthen to swell, and then to turn numb with the intense cold. My brother\nbore it better than I, from having been more out upon the hills. He did\nnot speak, except to call Lassie. I strove to be brave, and not\ncomplain; but now I felt the deadly fatal sleep stealing over me.\n\n\u201cI can go no farther,\u201d I said, in a drowsy tone. I remember I suddenly\nbecame dogged and resolved. Sleep I would, were it only for five\nminutes. If death were to be the consequence, sleep I would. Gregory\nstood still. I suppose, he recognized the peculiar phase of suffering\nto which I had been brought by the cold.\n\n\u201cIt is of no use,\u201d said he, as if to himself. \u201cWe are no nearer home\nthan we were when we started, as far as I can tell. Our only chance is\nin Lassie. Here! roll thee in my maud, lad, and lay thee down on this\nsheltered side of this bit of rock. Creep close under it, lad, and I\u2019ll\nlie by thee, and strive to keep the warmth in us. Stay! hast gotten\naught about thee they\u2019ll know at home?\u201d\n\nI felt him unkind thus to keep me from slumber, but on his repeating\nthe question, I pulled out my pocket-handkerchief, of some showy\npattern, which Aunt Fanny had hemmed for me\u2014Gregory took it, and tied\nit round Lassie\u2019s neck.\n\n\u201cHie thee, Lassie, hie thee home!\u201d And the white-faced ill-favoured\nbrute was off like a shot in the darkness. Now I might lie down\u2014now I\nmight sleep. In my drowsy stupor I felt that I was being tenderly\ncovered up by my brother; but what with I neither knew nor cared\u2014I was\ntoo dull, too selfish, too numb to think and reason, or I might have\nknown that in that bleak bare place there was nought to wrap me in,\nsave what was taken off another. I was glad enough when he ceased his\ncares and lay down by me. I took his hand.\n\n\u201cThou canst not remember, lad, how we lay together thus by our dying\nmother. She put thy small, wee hand in mine\u2014I reckon she sees us now;\nand belike we shall soon be with her. Anyhow, God\u2019s will be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cDear Gregory,\u201d I muttered, and crept nearer to him for warmth. He was\ntalking still, and again about our mother, when I fell asleep. In an\ninstant\u2014or so it seemed\u2014there were many voices about me\u2014many faces\nhovering round me\u2014the sweet luxury of warmth was stealing into every\npart of me. I was in my own little bed at home. I am thankful to say,\nmy first word was \u201cGregory?\u201d\n\nA look passed from one to another\u2014my father\u2019s stern old face strove in\nvain to keep its sternness; his mouth quivered, his eyes filled slowly\nwith unwonted tears.\n\n\u201cI would have given him half my land\u2014I would have blessed him as my\nson,\u2014oh God! I would have knelt at his feet, and asked him to forgive\nmy hardness of heart.\u201d\n\nI heard no more. A whirl came through my brain, catching me back to\ndeath.\n\nI came slowly to my consciousness, weeks afterwards. My father\u2019s hair\nwas white when I recovered, and his hands shook as he looked into my\nface.\n\nWe spoke no more of Gregory. We could not speak of him; but he was\nstrangely in our thoughts. Lassie came and went with never a word of\nblame; nay, my father would try to stroke her, but she shrank away; and\nhe, as if reproved by the poor dumb beast, would sigh, and be silent\nand abstracted for a time.\n\nAunt Fanny\u2014always a talker\u2014told me all. How, on that fatal night, my\nfather,\u2014irritated by my prolonged absence, and probably more anxious\nthan he cared to show, had been fierce and imperious, even beyond his\nwont, to Gregory; had upbraided him with his father\u2019s poverty, his own\nstupidity which made his services good for nothing\u2014for so, in spite of\nthe old shepherd, my father always chose to consider them. At last,\nGregory had risen up, and whistled Lassie out with him\u2014poor Lassie,\ncrouching underneath his chair for fear of a kick or a blow. Some time\nbefore, there had been some talk between my father and my aunt\nrespecting my return; and when aunt Fanny told me all this, she said\nshe fancied that Gregory might have noticed the coming storm, and gone\nout silently to meet me. Three hours afterwards, when all were running\nabout in wild alarm, not knowing whither to go in search of me\u2014not even\nmissing Gregory, or heeding his absence, poor fellow\u2014poor, poor\nfellow!\u2014Lassie came home, with my handkerchief tied round her neck.\nThey knew and understood, and the whole strength of the farm was turned\nout to follow her, with wraps, and blankets, and brandy, and every\nthing that could be thought of. I lay in chilly sleep, but still alive,\nbeneath the rock that Lassie guided them to. I was covered over with my\nbrother\u2019s plaid, and his thick shepherd\u2019s coat was carefully wrapped\nround my feet. He was in his shirt-sleeves\u2014his arm thrown over me\u2014a\nquiet smile (he had hardly ever smiled in life) upon his still, cold\nface.\n\nMy father\u2019s last words were, \u201cGod forgive me my hardness of heart\ntowards the fatherless child!\u201d\n\nAnd what marked the depth of his feeling of repentance, perhaps more\nthan all, considering the passionate love he bore my mother, was this:\nwe found a paper of directions after his death, in which he desired\nthat he might lie at the foot of the grave, in which, by his desire,\npoor Gregory had been laid with OUR MOTHER.",
