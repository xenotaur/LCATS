    "body": "You might say Garrity brought it on himself. The way I put it, Garrity\nwas the architect of his own disasters. It's a nicely put phrase, I\nthink. Anyway, a lot of people tried to tell him what might happen. I\ndid, for one, though I'd never have thought it would happen in just\nthat way. What I would have predicted for Garrity would be trouble, but\njust ordinary trouble: jail, or getting his Space Engineer's ticket\nsuspended, or something like that. Not the kind of trouble he's got.\n\nI remember distinctly the first time I heard Garrity explaining his\ntheory. It wasn't a new theory, but the way Garrity talked about\nit, you'd think he'd invented it personally. We were sitting in the\nmessroom in the _Aloha_--that was the old _Aloha_, the one that\nbelonged to the Muller Space Lines. Talking about women--trip like\nthat.\n\nNeither Garrity nor I had ever touched down on Seranis, which was where\nwe'd be in another week or so. The other off-watch man, Gloster, had\nbeen there several times and liked the place.\n\n\"A lot of Earthside Oriental in 'em,\" Gloster said. \"They're little\nbrown characters, real obliging. The girls especially. You just treat\n'em polite and they'll treat you right back.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" I said, considering the idea.\n\n\n\nGarrity curled his long lip. \"It'll cost you just as much in the end.\nWomen are always looking for something.\"\n\n\"Not this kind on Seranis,\" Gloster said. \"Best port I've ever been in.\nI'm staying on the _Aloha_ till I get to putting curtains on my cabin\nport.\"\n\nGarrity shook his head. He looked as cynical as he could, for his age,\nwhich was twenty-four. We were all of us fresh out of Lunar, with the\nink hardly dry on our Engineer tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you,\" said Garrity. \"I haven't seen a woman yet that\nwouldn't cost you more than she was worth in the long run.\"\n\n\"Long run?\" I asked him. \"We don't spend more than a few days down on\nSeranis. Isn't going to _be_ any long run. If she runs, let her to\ncatch her before takeoff time.\"\n\nGloster chuckled, but Garrity just looked righteous.\n\n\"You'll see what I mean,\" he told us.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Gloster said. \"I guess you and me will go downtown and pick up\na couple girls and take in some high-priced amusements, like listening\nto records at the Spaceman's Union Lounge. After which we hurl our\nhard-earned cash away on a quart of pink arrack and we take the girls\nhome with it. In the morning, we haven't got a credit left, so we blast\noff with nothing but a set of beautiful memories.\" Gloster crowed.\n\"What's the matter, anyway, Garrity? The Union gets us the best wage\nscale in any space fleet and you still think girls cost too much? Even\nthe Seranese?\"\n\nGarrity kept on looking wise. \"I'm not kidding. I've seen a lot of men\ncome up to retirement without a credit put away. Half-pay and nothing\nelse, all because they spent everything having a good time.\"\n\n\"You can do without women, maybe?\" I asked.\n\n\"No,\" Garrity admitted. \"I'm a normal man.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Gloster, very flat.\n\nGarrity looked peeved. \"Well, I am. But I'm careful, too. I figured it\nall out a long time back. I aim to have everything you guys look for\nand not go to half the trouble and expense.\"\n\n\"What did you figure out?\"\n\n\"I'm going to get married.\"\n\nGloster and I just sat there, looking at each other. After a while,\nGloster finished his coffee in silence. He got up, looked at Garrity,\nshook his head sadly, and went out.\n\n\n\nIt took me a while to finish looking Garrity over, myself. When I\nmanaged to get my voice under control, I asked him what he was talking\nabout.\n\n\"I saw what happened to my old man,\" Garrity told me. \"When he came\nup for retirement, he was broke. He doesn't complain, but he never\nhas anything left out of his retirement pay. Spends his time loafing\naround and writing his memoirs. It was women, mostly; after he lost my\nmother--she died when I was born--he went off to space again. Sent back\nenough to keep me, spent the rest in one port or another.\"\n\nI didn't say anything, but it was beginning to add up. I don't know\nanything about psychology, but I thought there might be something\nlike a reason in what Garrity was telling me for the way Garrity was.\nSomewhere he'd got the idea that his old man wasn't happy. I doubted\nit, because I've seen and talked to lots of old retired hands. Most\nof them had a good life behind them and they were still enjoying the\ntaste of it.\n\nBut I didn't argue with Garrity about it. I've got more sense. When a\nman's got a pet notion, leave it alone. You won't pry him off it and\nyou might get him mad at you. A spaceship's too small to make enemies\nin.\n\n\"Suppose you get married,\" I asked him. \"So you have a place to go, and\na girl in it, in one port. How about all the others? Going to take a\npermanent port watch instead of seeing a little fun?\"\n\n\"Easy,\" Garrity said. \"I'll just get married in all of them.\"\n\n\"_All_ of them?\"\n\n\"Well, the ones I'm in most often. Terra City, Chafanor, some other\nplaces. I'm thinking of homesteading on one line as soon as I pad on a\nlittle seniority.\"\n\nThe notion did have a certain cold practicality about it. I didn't like\nit, but as far as getting away with it went, he could.\n\nGarrity went on to explain a bit more; his system seemed to have been\nworked out to the last detail. He'd set up two, three, maybe four or\nfive happy little households, spend his end-of-run leave in each,\ndividing up his time nice and even. All of them together wouldn't cost\nhim what a night or two on the town might.\n\nTo add to that, he'd pick out his wives with care. They'd all be\ndifferent in a lot of ways, for the sake of variety, but they'd all\nbe affectionate, home-loving girls, and careful with money. They'd\nsave his credits for him. And when he retired, he could keep active\nand happy visiting them and his various families, which he expected to\ninclude a real lot of kids and grandchildren.\n\n\"I don't believe in small families,\" he explained.\n\n\n\nAt the time, I never thought he'd try to carry it through. I've heard\nwild ideas in messrooms before, particularly halfway through a long\ntrip. They usually fade out when a man gets his feet down on gravity\nagain. This one didn't.\n\nBut it might have worked out, at that. It was just Garrity's luck that\nhe signed on the _Brooklyn_.\n\nThe _Brooklyn_ carried ore from Serco to Terra, and Terran machinery\nback to Serco, a regular, steady run. When I bumped into Garrity in the\nhiring hall, he told me he'd just signed on her, and I told him I had,\ntoo. Naturally, I asked him how the Garrity old-age-insurance system\nwas working out.\n\n\"Well,\" he confessed, \"I'm not married yet. But I've got a likely girl\nhere in Terra City. All I've got to do is ask her. Now if I can line\none up in Serco--\"\n\n\"In Serco?\" I turned a little pale, I think. \"Listen, Garrity, have\nyou ever been in Serco?\"\n\n\"No. Why? Aren't they humanoids?\"\n\n\"Oh, sure.\" I was trying to think just how you'd describe Serco and its\npeculiar people. \"Only different.\"\n\n\"How're they different?\"\n\nLooking at that stubborn mug of his, I knew I wasn't going to be able\nto explain this in a million years. It was just no use. Garrity had\neverything all figured out. But I took one try.\n\n\"They've never been much of a mechanical culture; they buy all their\nstuff from outside, in exchange for ore and timber. But they're one of\nthe oldest civilizations in the Galaxy. They've spent a million years\nlearning about minds and thoughts, all that philosophy sort of thing.\nI don't mean they aren't perfectly all right. They're human, but they\nknow a lot. It wouldn't pay to fool around with them.\"\n\nGarrity laughed. \"Maybe they might read my mind?\"\n\nI knew it was no use. I just shrugged, bought Garrity a beer to\ncelebrate, and we headed for the spaceport.\n\nNo, the Sercoans don't read minds. At least, I don't think they do,\nthough there are times when they're that clever at adding you up that\nyou'd think they _were_ looking at your thoughts.\n\nGarrity didn't get caught that way. He got caught because he couldn't\nkeep from telling the rest of us about his great idea. One of the\nnavigators, a man named Lane, was the one who told Katha about it.\n\n\n\nLane was in love with Katha, naturally. Everybody was. She worked in\nthe port medical office and she was one of the reasons why it took a\nhigh-seniority card to sign on a ship for Serco. There were a lot of\nmen who'd take an extra set of immune shots just to have Katha give it\nto them. And it isn't a bit easy to figure out why.\n\nShe wasn't any beauty. Good-looking, sort of, but not especially so;\na tallish girl, with gray eyes and a long, narrow, sensitive face.\nBrowny-red hair that always looked a little carelessly cut. As I said,\nnothing at all special. It was just something about her. She could have\nhad her pick and she picked Garrity. And only Lane broke the rules and\ntold her. Trouble is, he told her a couple of weeks too late.\n\nIt was because Lane had never thought that Katha would fall for Garrity\nthat he hadn't told her before. But when he touched down at Serco port\nand heard that Katha and Garrity had gotten married the week before, he\ndidn't waste any more time. He called Katha up from the spaceport, and\ntold her all about the Garrity plan, and how she was only the first,\nbut definitely not the last.\n\nLane told me afterward what Katha had said.\n\n\"I am not jealous,\" she'd answered. \"If he had wanted others when he\nwas away, he could have done as he wished, as a man might. But he has\nspoken to you as a child, not a man. I do not like that.\"\n\nShe didn't sound terribly angry. It was the way she phrased it that\nbothered Lane.\n\n\"But he is not a bad man,\" she said thoughtfully to Lane. \"And he is a\ngood lover and makes a fine husband. I will not hurt him, but I think I\nwill give him something which will teach him, if he wants to learn. And\nwhen he has learned, I will take it away again and he may be as free as\nhe can ... as free as any of you of the outside ever are.\"\n\nI can't tell you what it was she did. Neither can Garrity. Hell, he\ndidn't even know she'd done anything! He kissed her good-by at the\nport gates and went on his way, and she went back to work in the port\nmedical office. As far as any of us could see, the Garrity plan was\nwell under way.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't six months before I saw the thing starting off. That was\nwhen I was invited to Garrity's second wedding. It was in Terra City,\nand when he asked me to come down with him for a witness, I assumed it\nwould be the girl he had been busily courting before he went to Serco.\nBut when I walked into the marriage registry office and took a look at\nthe girl, I got a clear, horrific idea of just what Katha had done to\nGarrity.\n\nHe didn't think anything had been done to him. He was all smiles. He\nbrought the girl toward me, proud and possessive, grinning all over his\nface.\n\n\"This is Mary Collins,\" he told me, and I kept on looking, not saying\nanything. She smiled, and shook hands, and I could tell by her\nexpression that she knew exactly what I was thinking.\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn't say a word about it to Garrity. There was\nalways the faint possibility that I might be wrong, in which case I\ncould make a lot of trouble by saying a few words. The words were\nthere, though, straining to get out. When he said, \"Mary Collins,\" what\nI wanted to say was, \"No, it isn't. It's Katha.\"\n\nBecause it was. After I watched the girl long enough, all the way\nthrough the marriage ceremony, then down in the elevator and out into\nthe street, I became dead certain.\n\nThere was a brown mole on Katha's arm. Mary had it, too. And there was\na look about the eyes--well, there could only be one Katha.\n\nWhat I could not understand was why Garrity didn't see it. After all,\nhe'd been _married_ to Katha.\n\nBut when I tried to say something to him, he brushed it off.\n\n\"Sure, Mary looks a little like Katha,\" he agreed with me. \"But there\nare all kinds of small differences. Things a man finds out as he goes\nalong. Look, I'm very fond of both of them. I know the difference.\nYou're just confused by the slight resemblance.\"\n\nThe clincher was the problem of how Katha had reached Terra City ahead\nof Garrity, to begin with, and whether there was still a Katha in\nSerco. I asked a man off a ship fresh from Serco and he told me Katha\nhadn't been there for some time. No one knew where she'd gone, but she\nhad said she'd be back.\n\nSo Mary _could_ be Katha, given a fast passenger ship.\n\nAnd Arnel could be Katha, too. Arnel had a mole in the right place. So\ndid Lillian. And Ruth. And Virginia.\n\n\n\nYes, Garrity married every one of them. Six girls, six planets. It took\nhim a while, and by the time he got as far as Ruth, he was going to a\nlot of trouble to arrange his shipping runs so he could make the full\ncircuit. But every so often I'd hear from him, or run into him, and\nthere would always be a new one.\n\nThe Garrity plan was going fine, but it lacked that one ingredient he\nhad counted on--variety. Every one of those girls was Katha.\n\n_He_ didn't think so. He could call off the differences between them\nby the hour. To listen to him, if you hadn't actually seen them, you'd\nhave believed every word he said.\n\nEach one of them gets a share of Garrity's pay--a big share, from the\nlooks of it. Each one of them keeps a nice place for Garrity and,\nwhen he comes into port, he eats and sleeps as well as any honest\ngroundwalker. And each one of them has a small fat baby boy, of whose\nexact age Garrity never seems to be quite sure. Two or three of the\nkids seem extremely advanced for their ages and they were all born\nfairly close together, which was enough to make Garrity as proud as a\nrooster.\n\nAnd Garrity seems to be the only one who can't tell.\n\nThinking about it might make a man want to rush off to Serco and find a\ngirl like Katha ... and Serco is full of them. I'd _like_ having a girl\nlike Katha. I'd like having _six_ Kathas even better.\n\nBut I'm not going to.\n\nI won't drive myself batty trying to figure out how she'd be keeping me\nfooled.\n\nAnd especially _why_.",
