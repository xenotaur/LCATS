    "body": "To everyone in the Solar System I was a big shot, understand? Everyone\nbut two--the two that counted most. One of the two was Suzi, and the\nother was me. The difference was that Suzi made no bones about telling\nme I was a fake; in my own mind the knowledge was there but more or\nless subconscious.\n\nOn this particular occasion Suzi was standing in the center of the half\nacre living room of my new penthouse on top the two hundred story\nSpacenter Building in Neuve Los Angeles. She had her hands on her hips\nand was glaring around at the furniture, the pictures, the statuary.\n\nShe said bitingly, \"Jak, you're a phony.\"\n\n\"A what?\" I complained. \"Listen, Suzi, don't start calling me those\nprehistoric names again.\"\n\n\"A phony,\" she said, \"a humbug, a four flusher, a quack, a faker....\"\n\nShe'd finally got to a word I knew. \"Hey,\" I protested, \"what's this\nall about?\"\n\nShe indicated the portraits of me hanging on the wall. She pointed out\nthe statuettes. She picked up a magazine and showed me the ad on the\nback page--me, endorsing a boomerang. I'd got a thousand credits for\nthat.\n\nShe went over to the bookcase and pulled out a copy of \"How I Became\nChamp\" and the first volume of \"Gladiator Technique\". Both by me. That\nis, ghost written for me; but my name was on the cover. She indicated\ntwo or three other books I was cashing in on.\n\n\"You're a phony, Jak,\" she repeated. \"You used to be a nice quiet\nfellow, actually more shy and retiring than was good for you. Now your\nhead is swollen beyond bearing.\"\n\nI was getting a little hot about this. For the past few months I'd been\nacquiring the habit of having people look up to me, admiring me, asking\nfor my autograph, that sort of thing.\n\n\"Look here,\" I said. \"Just because you've known me for years and\njust because for most of that time I've been chasing you, doesn't\nmean that the Gladiator Champion of the Solar System is a nobody.\" I\nfinished with what I thought would be the clincher. \"Let me tell you,\nthere isn't one girl in a billion who wouldn't be glad to be in your\nshoes--engaged to Jak Dempsi.\"\n\n\n\nIt was the clincher all right. She took her hands from her hips and\nfolded them over her breasts and glared. \"Oh yes there is,\" she told\nme. \"There's exactly one girl who isn't interested in being engaged to\nyou Gladiator Jak Dempsi. Me,\" she snapped.\n\nI glared back at her. \"Are you crazy?\" I asked. \"We're going to be\nmarried the day after tomorrow.\"\n\n\"That's where you're wrong,\" she snapped again. \"I became engaged to a\nnice, quiet, thoughtful, second-rate gladiator. A mistake happened and\nhe wound up Solar System Champion--and a stuffed shirt. The engagement\nis off.\"\n\n\"Second-rate gladiator....\" I blurted indignantly, but she was already\non her way, stamping across the Venusian Chameleon rug to the door.\n\nI was so surprised I stood there, letting her go. It took me a full\nminute to understand that Suzi had just run out on me. _Me!_ The\nvictor at the Interplanetary Meet. The sole survivor of the scores of\ngladiators who fought it out once every ten years to see which planet\nof the System would dominate interplanetary affairs.\n\nI went over to the bookcase and wrenched out one of the many books on\nprehistoric times that Suzi was always insisting I read. That's Suzi's\nbug, if you didn't know. Prehistoric times, customs, history, language,\nlegends--all of a period that most people don't even know ever\nexisted, and don't care.\n\nThe book was \"Glossary of Ancient Terminology.\" I thumbed through it\nand finally found my words.\n\n\"Stuffed shirt!\" I yelped indignantly. \"A _stuffed shirt_! Me?\"\n\n\n\nTen minutes later I was in the Gladiator Room of the Spacenter Building\nand already had three or four slugs of _woji_ under my belt.\n\n\"A stuffed shirt, yet. Me! Solar System Champ.\" I grunted sarcastically\nand made with a curt flip of my hand to the bartender. He was a\nVenusian spiderman, who of course, make the best barkeeps in the System.\n\n\"Another woji,\" I ordered.\n\nA guy drifted down to me from the other end of the bar. \"Hanging one\non, Champ?\" he asked. \"You must be out of training.\"\n\nI looked him up and down. I'd never seen him before. However, in my\nposition you have to be nice to the fans.\n\nI said, \"Woji doesn't bother me. I _train_ on it.\" Suzi's words were\nstill burning. I added, out of the side of my mouth, \"If you really got\nit, you got it, and if you haven't you haven't and all the training in\nthe world won't give it to you.\"\n\nI flexed my muscles. \"Woji isn't going to hurt a man like me.\"\n\nHe blinked in admiration. \"Guess you're right at that, Champ,\" he said.\n\"It's the second-raters that have to be watching everything they eat,\neverything they drink, everything they do.\"\n\n\"Right,\" I told him, condescendingly.\n\nHe climbed up on the stool next to me.\n\n\"Have a woji?\" I asked him. I was glad to have his company; at least\nit'd keep my mind off Suzi.\n\n\"No thanks,\" he said, shuddering. \"But I wouldn't mind a bloor.\"\n\nSo I ordered him a bloor and another double woji for me.\n\nMy new friend said hesitantly, \"Champ, what'd 'ya think of these\nvisitors, explorers, or whatever you want to call them, from Centaurus?\"\n\nHow is it that when you become a celebrity--no matter in what\nfield--your opinions on every subject seem noteworthy to everybody\nelse? I'd read a little about the Centaurians, seen an item or two on\nthe viziscreen, but I didn't know anything about them worth mentioning.\nI was too busy with my own rapidly developing affairs to spend much\ntime keeping up with Solar System news.\n\n\"What about them?\" I asked, noticing that my tongue was at last\nbeginning to get a bit thick. I ordered another drink. The bartender\nstarted to protest, but then shrugged six of his shoulders and began\nmixing it.\n\n\"Didn't you hear the latest?\" the guy asked. \"They're looking for room\nfor colonization and the Solar System attracts them.\"\n\nIt was shortly after this that the fog rolled in, and it didn't roll\nout again until the following morning when my manager gave me a\ndealcoholizer.\n\n\n\nHe was hopping mad. And when I say hopping mad I mean just that since\nMari Nown, my manager, is a chicken-headed Mercurian _Bouncer_. A\nnationalized citizen of Terra, of course, but a Mercurian with all\ntheir characteristic excitability.\n\nWhen my head cleared, he was jumping up and down in front of me\nand waving a sheet of newspaper he'd torn off the recorder on the\nviziscreen.\n\n\"Simmer down,\" I told him. \"My head still aches, and besides, I can't\nunderstand what you're yelling about.\" I added nastily, \"In fact, I\ncan't understand how anything could happen that you'd yell about. All\nyou do is sit around and let ten percent of everything I make roll into\nyour pockets. You're probably the richest gladiator manager in the\nsystem and--\"\n\nHe stopped hopping long enough to fix me with a beady eye. Finally\nhe became coherent. \"And that's exactly what I want to remain!\" he\nshrilled. \"You stupid _makron_, what're you trying to do, get yourself\nkilled?\" He waved the news sheet again.\n\nI began to catch on to the fact that I must have done something the day\nbefore while under the influence of--ugh, I couldn't even think of the\nword without my stomach churning.\n\n\"All right,\" I said. \"What is it? I don't remember.\"\n\nHe was prancing again. \"You don't remember! I'll say you don't\nremember! If you did, you'd be hiding under the bed.\"\n\nThat got to me. I raised up indignantly. \"Hiding under the bed? Me? I\ndon't have to hide from _anything_. I'm champ!\"\n\n\"That's pronounced _chump_,\" he whistled nastily. He tossed me the news\nsheet.\n\nThe headline read: _Interplanetary Champ says issues between Solar\nSystem and Centaurus should be settled in the arena._\n\n\"Did I say that?\" I said interestedly. \"When?\"\n\nHe was almost hopping again. \"To that cub reporter in the Gladiator\nRoom, you stupid _makron_!\"\n\n\"Don't swear at me,\" I growled. \"I didn't know he was a reporter.\nBesides, what're you so excited about? Maybe it'd be a good idea.\"\n\n\"Look at that next head,\" he shrilled.\n\nIt read: _Centaurians accept challenge of Jak Dempsi._\n\n\"Hey,\" I said, \"that ought to be quite a fight. Who do you think we'll\nhave representing the Solar System? A _Slaber_ from Jupiter would be a\ngood bet. He--\"\n\nThere he went again. He screamed, \"Of course! Of course, a _Slaber_\nwould be best, _but you're the champion! A stupid idiot--but\nchampion!_\"\n\n\n\nI gaped at that, then let my eyes go down to the news account. He was\nright. As champion, I was scheduled to meet the Centaurian gladiator.\nOn the outcome would depend the fate of the System.\n\n\"Well,\" I said slowly. \"Guess it makes sense at that. I _am_ the best\ngladiator in the System.\"\n\nHe closed his little bird eyes in anguish.\n\nI added, \"As a matter of fact, I could use the exercise. I haven't had\na meet in months.\" I eyed him accusingly. \"What kind of a manager are\nyou? Here I am, Solar System Champ and you haven't got me a fight since\nI won the Interplanetary Meet. The biggest drawing card in--\"\n\nHe'd got to the point where he was so mad he wasn't hopping any more.\nJust breathing real deep.\n\nHe said, \"The reason you haven't had any meets since you became champ\nis because I'd rather have a live champ making a good living endorsing\nCallipso Snak-goat Cheese--and me getting ten percent--than I would\nhave a dead champ.\"\n\n\"What'd'ya mean?\" I scoffed. \"Nobody gets killed in an exhibition\nmatch.\" I flexed my muscles. \"Besides, I can take care of myself up\nagainst any earth-side gladiator after--\"\n\nHe glowered at me. \"Anybody who killed the champ, by accident or\notherwise, in an exhibition match, would have a nice reputation for\nhimself. _You_ might go into the arena with the idea of not killing\nyour opponent, but would _he_?\"\n\nI shrugged uncomfortably. \"I can take care of myself--\"\n\n\"Look,\" he shrilled, \"let's go back over a little recent arena history.\nLess than a year ago you were a second-rater fighting at the state\nfairs. You went to Mars to watch the Interplanetary Meet which is held\nonce every decade to decide interplanetary affairs. The ship carrying\nTerra's gladiators was lost in space and you were tossed in as an\nemergency replacement.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said. \"The first time a Terran ever won an Interplanetary\nMeet.\"\n\nHe whistled disgustedly, \"The first time a Terran ever lasted more than\nfive minutes.\"\n\n\"Well?\" I said proudly.\n\nHe pointed a few fingers at me. \"BY A FLUKE! By using a lot of ideas\nyou got from that quotation spouting girl friend of yours, you won by a\nfluke! Among other things, you _played possum_, as you called it, under\na heap of corpses until all the others were either killed or wounded\nand then got up and finished them off. The fans throughout the system\nare still screaming about that.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm still champ,\" I said truculently. \"I licked them once,\nand....\"\n\n\"Aw, shut up,\" he shrilled. He whirled about and started for the door.\n\"I'll see what I can do.\"\n\n\n\nI didn't know what he meant by that, but I shrugged and rang for\nmy breakfast. The twinge of conscience I felt inside, I manfully\nsuppressed. I suppose that I really knew he was right, but I'd been\ngetting a good deal of ego-boo the past months and it was hard--almost\nimpossible, in fact--not to listen to it.\n\nBy noon the dealcoholizer had completed its work and I felt more or\nless normal. I suppose I should have been worrying about the bout with\nthe Centaurian, but I wasn't. Not particularly. I was worrying about\nSuzi.\n\nSuzi worked for a chain of publications as a female sports reporter\ncovering the gladiator meets from the woman's angle. What she wanted\nto do was write books about primitive culture, and for years that had\nbeen the barrier between us. She couldn't stand the fact that I wasn't\nparticularly interested in the ancients and spent half the time we\nhad together in trying to fill me with the lore she thought the big\ninterest in life. She'd even given me my professional name, explaining\nthat the original Jak Dempsi was one of the outstanding gladiators in\nancient times.\n\nAt any rate, I knew where she usually had her lunch and made my way\nthere, hoping to be able to patch things up. She'd promised to marry\nme, after I'd won the championship for Earth, and if there was anything\nI could do about it, I was going to see her hold to the engagement.\n\nThe Interplanetary Viziscreen Service, the I.V.S., occupies a building\nin Neuve Los Angeles nearly as large as Spacenter. Almost all of the\nI.V.S. people eat in the Auto Cafe, and it was there I made my way.\n\nSoft music was playing as I entered and looked over the three acre\nexpanse of tables. Of course, I didn't have to check them all--Suzi\nalways sat in the sport section with perhaps a few hundred others.\n\nThe soft pleasant dining music cut off abruptly and the autorch started\nblaring out an earsplitting tune that brought back enough of my\nheadache to make me grimace.\n\nSeveral thousand heads came up and looked toward the entrance where I\nstood. A movement started somewhere or other and before you knew it,\neverybody in the place was standing on his feet and slapping his hands\nlike crazy.\n\nEverybody but two.\n\nI could spot them now. Suzi and Alger Wilde were sitting at a table in\nthe sport section. I made my way toward them.\n\n\n\nAlger Wilde, I might as well explain here, is a _makron_ from the\nword _glorm_, if you'll pardon my language. He's been trying, in his\nsmirking way, to get in with Suzi for almost as many years as I have,\nand until I won the championship was doing at least as well as I. His\nstrong point was the fact that he was even further around the corner\nin regard to the ancients than was Suzi. They could sit and talk for\nhours about the primitive comic books and other cultural matters that\nthe average person had no interest in whatsoever.\n\nI still didn't know what all the clapping was about, and I still didn't\nlike the raucous music, but I ignored it all and made my way toward\ntheir table, rehearsing to myself what I was going to say to Suzi.\n\nWhen I got nearer, the two of them, self-consciously, also came to\ntheir feet and both made with feeble applause to the extent of clapping\ntheir hands together once or twice.\n\nI said, \"What goes on here?\"\n\nWe all sat down--with me congratulating myself that Suzi didn't\nobject--and Suzi, her eyes shining, gushed, \"Oh Jak, isn't it\nwonderful?\"\n\nI said, \"I guess so. What?\" I looked around the room in irritation.\n\"What's all the noise about? I can hardly hear ourselves talk.\"\n\nAlger Wilde said stiffly, \"It's the new anthem, _The Solar System\nForever_. Very patriotic. It was just completed by a staff of more\nthan three hundred of the System's outstanding musicians. I understand\nthat it's being played on every viziscreen on nine planets and twenty\nsatellites. On order of the governments of all Solar System League\nmembers, the musicians rushed it through.\"\n\n\"It sounds like it,\" I growled. At least everybody had sat down again\nand were eating their lunch.\n\nThe stars were still in Suzi's eyes. She said softly, \"It's dedicated\nto you, Jak.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nAlger Wilde bit out, \"Why'd you think everybody was clapping? You're\nthe hero of the System.\" He added, barely audibly, \"They know not what\nthey do.\"\n\nIt was beginning to dawn on me. My mind had been so full of Suzi that\nI'd almost forgotten about the Centaurian fight.\n\nSuzi cast her eyes down to the table and said softly, \"I'm sorry about\nyesterday, Jak. When I heard about your heroic challenge I realized how\nwrong I was.\"\n\nI scowled and said, \"I didn't exactly challenge them, just suggested\nthat the whole thing ought to be settled in the arena. Maybe a _Slaber_\nor a Saturnian gladiator, or--\"\n\nAlger said, satisfaction oozing, \"But you're the Champ, Jak.\"\n\nAnd Suzi gushed, \"So you'll certainly have the honor. Oh, Jak, our\nengagement will have to be postponed until after the fight.\"\n\n\n\nThere was a gleam in Wilde's eye. He said, \"And _after_ the fight the\nmarriage can take place. Only the brave deserve the fair, and; to the\nvictor belongs the spoils, as the ancients used to say.\"\n\nI knew what he was thinking. If I was killed in the arena, he'd be back\nin the running for Suzi. I growled, \"What the _kert_ do you mean by\nthat, Wilde?\"\n\nSuzi placed her hands over her ears. \"Please, Jak, your language.\"\n\nAlger Wilde said indignantly, \"Yes, what the hell is the idea talking\nthat way before Suzi?\"\n\nI said disgustedly, \"I'll be a _makron_\"--she covered her ears there,\ntoo--\"if I understand how you two figure. I say _kert_ and you're\nshocked. Five seconds later Wilde says _hell_, an ancient word meaning\npractically the same thing, and it's all right.\"\n\nWilde said indignantly, \"It's an entirely different matter. _Hell_ is\nnow a scholarly word, and quite acceptable. Of course, in ancient times\nit wasn't and when a cultivated person wished to use a strong expletive\nhe said _Hades_, which was still a more ancient word meaning the same\nthing. Using the scholarly expression made it all right.\"\n\n\"I give up,\" I said and turned to Suzi. \"Let's get out of here. I want\nto talk to you.\"\n\nShe said demurely, \"Yes, dear.\"\n\nI grunted a goodbye to Wilde and arose. There was applause again and\nthe autorch started blaring _The Solar System Forever_ as we left.\n\n\"You could get awfully tired of music like that,\" I said.\n\nSuzi said, \"Not me, Jak.\"\n\nThe usually crowded street outside the I.V.S. Building was curiously\nempty, but I didn't pay much attention. I was trying to figure out\nsome way of talking Suzi into marrying me before the fight, so it was\nseveral minutes before I noticed what was out of whack.\n\nA hundred yards before us, a hundred yards behind us, and across the\nstreet, were several scores of white uniformed officers, Solar League\npolice, clearing the pedestrians, and even vehicular traffic from our\nway.\n\nI started to say, \"What goes on here any--\"\n\nBut Suzi looked at me soulfully and said, \"Your guard of honor, Jak.\nThere's been some talk that the Centaurians might try to get at you\nbefore the meet.\"\n\nTo quote one of Suzi's favorite primitive exclamations, _Oh, Brother_.\n\n\"Look,\" I said. \"I can't talk to you in front of all this. I feel like\na parade. Let's go into a theatre, take a box and have this out.\"\n\nSuzi wasn't disagreeing with anything today.\n\n\n\nWe entered the theatre and made our way as quietly as possible toward a\nsound-proof box where we could be alone.\n\nSuddenly, the three dimensional figures on the stage faded, the\nlights went on and the autorch started blaring that confounded tune\nagain. Everyone in the theatre turned, spotted us and arose and began\nwhistling and clapping.\n\nI winced, but Suzi seemed to be in her glory. I hurried her along and\nwe entered the enclosed box where at least we couldn't hear them after\nI'd turned off the sound device.\n\nFinally, the lights went out again. Instead of resuming the play,\nhowever, we had a flash of the face of the President of Terra. He spoke\nvery seriously, very earnestly--and I had to sit through it after Suzi\nhad switched on the sound again. He pointed out at some length that we\nall must maintain faith and calm and hold in our hearts the image of\nthe champion of the Solar System, our own Terran Gladiator, Jak Dempsi.\n\nThe President's face faded and was replaced with a still of mine.\n\nThe audience rose to a man, faced our box and applauded like crazy. I\nhad a sneaking suspicion that the show wasn't going to go on as long as\nSuzi and I were there.\n\nI said, \"Let's get out of here before that autorch--\" but I was too\nlate. It started blaring _The Solar System Forever_ before we reached\nthe door. Everybody was singing too, which made it worse. I hadn't\nknown before that it had words.\n\nOtherwise, it was a successful evening. Particularly after I convinced\nthe Solar System League officers that there was no need for around a\ndozen of them to be stationed in my apartment. I told them that they\ncould patrol the corridors, my roof, and the street outside to their\nhearts' content, but my apartment was out. The officer in charge took\nanother look at Suzi and evidently decided I was probably right--there\nare things more important than personal safety.\n\nThe rest of the evening was spent by Suzi proving that she still loved\nme. She offered some excellent evidence. Anyway, it satisfied me....\n\n\n\nI was awakened again the next morning by Mari Nown who, as he had the\nmorning before, was waving a sheet of newspaper before my eyes. This\ncould grow into a very unpleasant habit.\n\nBut at least he wasn't hopping this time. In fact, he seemed quite\npleased with himself.\n\nI turned over on my other side and growled, \"Go away, I was having a\nbeautiful dream about Suzi.\"\n\nHe whistled happily, \"I've done it for you, Jak. Everything'll be fine\nnow.\"\n\n\"That's good,\" I began sleepily, but then I sat upright in bed, with\nquick suspicion. \"You've done what?\" I grabbed the newspaper from his\nhand. It read, _Champ's Manager reveals he has Venusian Elephantiasis_.\n\nI stared at it and then at him. \"What in _kert_ is Venusian\nElephantiasis, and where'd you get the idea I have it?\"\n\nHe shrilled proudly, \"I had to do a lot of research. It's one of the\nfew diseases left in the system that's incurable. So rare, for one\nthing.\"\n\nI was still half asleep. I shook my head.\n\nHe said, \"Don't you get it? You won't have to fight now. You can retire\nfrom the arena, as undefeated champ, and make a top notch living for\nthe rest of your life endorsing--\"\n\nI jumped out of the bed and dashed to the telo, but even before I could\nreach it it glowed on and Suzi's face, cold as a winter day on Pluto,\nwas there.\n\nHer eyes seemed to focus about three feet beyond my head and she said,\n\"Jak Dempsi, you're a phony. A cheap, petty, _cowardly_ phony. Venusian\nElephantiasis, indeed!\" Her voice dripped scorn. \"I never want to hear\nfrom you again.\"\n\n\"_Suzi_, wait a minute. I can explain,\" I yelled. \"My manager--\" But\nthe screen had died.\n\nI spun on him, but he wasn't at the side of the bed where I'd seen him\nlast. Instead he was over at the Viziscreen, the glee gone from his\nchicken-like face, and anxiety beginning to become evident.\n\nHe shrilled, \"They can't do this to me. We're being robbed!\"\n\n\n\nI started for him, my fingers stretched out like claws. Here was one\nMercurian _Bouncer_ who was going to have his neck wrung, like the fowl\nhe resembled.\n\nSomething in his attitude stopped me. I came up beside him and growled,\n\"What now, you _makron_?\"\n\nHe pointed at the news sheet which had recorded the item.\n\n_Forty-three thousand Solar System scientists working on cure for\nVenusian Elephantiasis._\n\nHe shrilled despairingly, \"They'll have you cured in days.\"\n\nI snorted, \"Especially since I haven't got it in the first place.\nListen, what gave you the idea I wanted to get out of this fight,\nanyway? I'm not afraid--\"\n\nHe started hopping at that. \"_You're_ not afraid! You're too stupid,\ntoo conceited to be afraid. _I'm_ afraid, understand? I'm your manager;\nI know how good a gladiator you are, and I'm afraid. I'm afraid first\nthat you'll get killed and I'll lose the best thing I've ever had, but\neven more than that I'm afraid that this Solar System isn't going to be\nfit to live in after you lose this fight and the Centaurians take over.\"\n\nI growled truculently, \"I can whip anybody in the Solar System and I\ncan whip--\"\n\nHe flung two of his wing-arms up in despair. \"We have _Slabers_, we\nhave fast moving Spidermen, we have four armed Martians; but who do we\nget to represent us in the most important gladiatorial fight in history?\nA second-rate, inflated, balloon headed--\"\n\n\"Hey....\" I protested indignantly.\n\nBut he'd stopped of his own accord and clicked his heels in the\nMercurian version of snapping of fingers in sudden inspiration.\n\n\"Look,\" he whistled. \"If they can put forty-three thousand scientists\nto work figuring out a way to cure a disease they think you have, why\ncan't they put ten times that number--a thousand times--to work on some\nnew weapons you can use against this Centaurian _makron_?\"\n\nI scowled at him, not getting it. \"You know better than that. In the\narena the only weapons allowed are primitive ones, swords, spears,\nbattle axes, boomerangs--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" he shrilled excitedly, beginning to hop again. \"But this\nis different. They--the Centaurians--don't know that.\" He clicked his\nheels together again. \"It's the solution! We'll devise, in the next\nmonth, some sure thing weapon. You can't lose!\"\n\nBut I was worried more about Suzi than about the fight. I growled at\nhim, \"I don't need anything but my short sword. All I want to be sure\nabout is that I'm in that fight, see? If I'm not I'll never see--\"\n\nBut he was already darting for the door.\n\n\n\nWell, within the week the scientists had \"cured\" me of the disease that\nMari Nown had dreamed up. I was scheduled for the fight again.\n\nBut no word from Suzi. And no way of getting in touch with her. I tried\neverything, but Suzi just wasn't having any of me.\n\nWe started my training, and it became more or less of an Earth-wide\nsecret that the scientists were fixing me up with some secret weapons\nwhich would guarantee the victory. Most of the sportswriters who came\nto the training camp were tight lipped and disapproving about it--not\nquite playing the game, you know--but the governmental big shots who\nwere trembling in their boots over the Centaurian threat, made it clear\nthat anything was going to go to insure Solar System victory. So the\nreporters didn't print the stories they might have.\n\nExcept for Suzi.\n\nEvidently the word got back to her about the weapons I was learning\nto use, and she let loose at me in her column. Nothing that the\nCentaurians would understand, of course, but the digs were there. She\nmade it pretty clear that Jak Dempsi was a phony and that only with the\nuse of unsportsmanlike weapons would he consent to go into the arena at\nall.\n\nShe had some nasty comebacks, because sentiment was running pretty high\nthroughout the League planets, and anybody saying a word against the\nChamp was apt to find himself mobbed. They were frightened, understand?\nThe whole Solar System was frightened, and they couldn't bear the\nthought that I was less than their saviour.\n\nBut Suzi kept it up. She was the only sports reporter in the system who\ndared point out what they were all probably feeling.\n\nThe great trouble in the training was that we hadn't the vaguest idea\nof what the Centaurians looked like. Their tremendous ship, several\ntimes the size of the greatest of ours, hovered motionlessly over\nKrishna-Krishna, the Venusian capitol city, but thus far not one of\nthem had been spotted. They communicated with us, blank-screened, and\nwe had nothing to go on to decide whether or not they were humanoid, or\neven if they were air breathers, although the latter would seem likely\nif they wished to colonize the Solar System since all our life forms\nare based on oxygen.\n\nThe only thing was to provide me with several weapons, one each for the\nvarious different types of creature our Centaurians might be. In fact,\nit was only by dint of argument that I was allowed to take my short\nsword with me into the arena when the day finally arrived. The managers\nwho'd had my training in hand wanted to use the space and weight the\nsword would take up to carry another half dozen atomic grenades.\n\nI growled at them. \"Listen, if these grenades are going to work--and\nhow the _kert_ they could possibly fail to work, I don't know--_one_ of\nthem will do the job. I'll take my sword along if only for a good luck\ncharm; I've never been in an arena without it yet.\"\n\nAnd I added sarcastically, \"This is going to be some fight, this is. I\nfeel like a murderer.\"\n\nI kept the sword.\n\n\n\nNeedless to say, the amphitheatre was packed. Tens of thousands must\nhave pauperized themselves for fare to Venus and for the highly priced\nseats. But whatever the cost, the stands were packed beyond belief.\nAnd, of course, throughout the system every man, woman and child, every\nbrim, mador and loet, every--but you get the idea. Every intelligent\nliving thing in the Solar System was glued to his viziscreen.\n\nAnd above the arena floated the Centaurian ship, silent, sinister.\n\nThere were no preliminaries. That would have been too much.\n\nInstead, when the moment of conflict arrived, I came out into the\narena--staggered, might have been the better word. I had a burden of\nweapons that was just about all I could carry.\n\nWhen the stands first saw me enter, they came to their feet and began a\ncheer that should have echoed and reechoed--but didn't. It died almost\nbefore it began. When they saw my equipment, the cheer faltered, then\ndied in shame.\n\nThey realized, those citizens from all over the Solar System, what was\nhappening. The stakes were too high. The Solar System was trading honor\nfor security. Instead of being armed with the traditional sword or\nspear, battleaxe or boomerang, I was laden with the most deadly devices\nour scientists could develop.\n\nAs I said, the cheers died almost before they began.\n\nMaybe I flushed a little. I don't know. But I tightened my jaw. At\nleast they didn't boo. Everyone in the stands knew the issue; however\nhe writhed in shame there must be no indication to the Centaurians that\nwe weren't playing the game, that we weren't living up to our own rules.\n\nI stood, my back to the judge's stand, and waited. To the left was the\nsports box, and I could make out Suzi, even at that distance. Her face\nwas expressionless.\n\nA great helicopter suddenly and deftly detached itself from the\nCentaurian ship and gracefully swooped down. It was beautifully\nhandled, settling to the opposite side of the arena as gently as a\nbutterfly.\n\nA large door in its side opened, the Centaurian emerged, and a gasp\nfrom the stands went up; a gasp louder than the cheer that had\noriginally greeted me.\n\nOf all Solar System intelligent life forms, Jupiter's _Slaber_ is by\nfar the largest, and, for that reason, that and its natural armor\nshell, Jupiter had been winning the Interplanetary Meets two out of\nthree times for centuries.\n\nBut this hulking brute made the _Slaber_ seem a babe in arms. It\nresembled somewhat a six legged turtle, roughly twice the size of a\nTerran elephant. It had two lobster-like claws and four other limbs.\n\n\n\nEvidently, it had decided to end the battle as quickly as possible,\nbecause without either salute or warning it headed for me, the dust\nchurning up behind it as it came. Its legs were short but fantastically\nfast. They seemed a blur of speed and before I had got over the\nsurprise of its appearance it was half way across the arena toward me.\n\nA shout, almost a moan, of warning went up from the stands, and\nsuddenly those citizens of the Solar System were no longer ashamed of\nthe weapons I carried, no longer contemptuous of my honor.\n\nI grasped my atomic grenade from its hook on my belt, dropped the\nprojectile thrower to the ground to give my arm free play, and threw.\n\nHalf the total acreage of the arena went up in a gust of dirt, dust,\ngravel and colored smoke. Seconds later I had been thrown prostrate\nby the blast. Probably half the amphitheatre's occupants had been\nsimilarly treated, and how many blast casualties might have been among\nthem, I couldn't know.\n\nBut at least, I thought, the fight was over and I'd done the Solar\nLeague's dirty work for it. I'd never be able to hold up my head again\nin a circle of gladiators, but the System was safe.\n\nI came to my feet and turned to go.\n\nA shout, incredulous, unbelieving, arose from the stands, drowning out\nthe cries of those wounded by the blast of my grenade.\n\nI spun and stared.\n\nCrawling laboriously over the lip of the crater my grenade had caused\nwas the Centaurian. One of his many limbs seemed limp and useless, and\nhis shell was battered and begrimed, but he was still alive, and not\ntoo much the worse for wear.\n\nWhen it got to level ground again it seemed to pause momentarily,\nseeking me out.\n\nI grabbed up the heavy submachine gat--as Suzi tells me they called\nthem in the old days--and threw it to my shoulder. The projectiles it\nthrew were only half an inch in diameter but each of them packed a\ncharge of atomic explosive.\n\n\n\nI trained it and held the trigger down. The two hundred round drum was\nexhausted in less than a half minute, and the sound of the projectiles\nexploding against the shell of my foe was ear shocking in intensity.\nOnce again, a cloud of smoke and dust enveloped the Centaurian. And\nonly after the last cartridge had been expended and the submachine\ngat now useless, was the sigh of relief that went up over the stands\naudible.\n\nBut through the smoke, of a sudden, charged the six legged Centaurian\nand my eyes almost bugged out of their sockets. He was seemingly not\nfurther injured.\n\nI dodged quickly to one side, stumbling over the gat I'd thrown away,\nthinking the fight over, and it uselessly empty. It was only the\nstumbling that saved me. I rolled to the side and it was past me and\nspinning about for another attack.\n\nThe Centaurian growled in a thunderous voice, \"And now the fight\nbegins, Terran _makron_.\" Its bulk evidently was no indication of\na lack of intelligence. It had already not only learned to speak\nAmer-English, but could swear in our language.\n\nI had one more major weapon in my deadly arsenal. I whipped the\nblunderbuss-nosed, pistol-like device from my belt and trained it.\nEven though shielded with my especially designed ear plugs, the\nsubsonic sounds flowed over me, enveloped me, terrified me. What it was\ndoing to the enemy I could only guess.\n\nShaking my head in an attempt to clear it of the desperate, soul\nshaking fears brought on by the subsonic vibrator, I stared in the\ndirection of the Centaurian.\n\nHe seemed to be watching me, questioningly. And suddenly I understood\nthat he was waiting for the weapon to work! He wanted to see what it\nwas going to do.\n\n_It wasn't doing anything!_\n\nA quarter of a mile away, on the other side of the amphitheatre, and\nsupposedly out of range, spectators were fainting in droves, literally\nthousands of them screaming or keeling over. But a few yards before me\nhe stood unimpressed.\n\nI swore and threw the thing down, ripped off the rest of the belts and\nequipment they'd foisted upon me and reached for my sword.\n\nIt dashed forward, extending a tentacle from its body that formerly I'd\nbeen unaware of. I swung desperately and the sword clanged against the\nlimb. I darted backward, noticing a large dent in the cutting edge.\n\nLike a flash one of the lobster claws snapped out at me, nipping a cut\nin my left side, just below the ribs. Had it been another six inches\nover, I would have been cut in half.\n\n\n\nI dashed to one side and it rushed past, stirring up a breeze as it\nwent. How such a large creature could get up momentum so rapidly was a\nmystery to me.\n\nI grated out one of Suzi's slogans to give myself courage. _The bigger\nthey are, the harder they fall._ And then it came to me that the\ntrouble was that if they're big enough perhaps they don't get around to\nfalling at all.\n\nIt was about and after me again.\n\nI stood in its path, sword in hand, waiting. A massive groan went up\nfrom the stands.\n\nJust before it reached me, I darted forward, crouched low, and dashed\nunder its belly. Here, if anywhere, was the soft spot. As I ran, I\nthrust desperately upward with all my strength, then I was suddenly\ncompletely under and beyond it.\n\nI spun around and stood there panting and staring at the end of my\nbroken pointed sword.\n\nIt turned too, as though looking to find my trampled body, and\nsurprised that I'd survived. It was about thirty feet away, and\nseemingly resting.\n\nSuddenly from its mouth gushed forth a stream of flame, reaching out\nfor me.\n\nIt was only by the merest chance that my grenade-made crater was\nimmediately behind me. I tripped again and fell backward, and the sheet\nof flame passed over me.\n\nA sigh went up from the stands.\n\nSuddenly, over the ridge it came tearing. Hoping, evidently, to catch\nme before I recovered from my fall.\n\nIt had miscalculated and passed a good six feet to my right. I sprung\nto my feet and dashed over in time to deal its tail a smashing\nblow--and to accumulate another dent in my blade.\n\nAt this pace, my strength was rapidly giving out, and his seemed as\ngreat as ever--but I was still quicker in that my size and build\nenabled me to turn, spin, dodge, more effectively.\n\nHe tried twice more to get me with his flaming breath, and both times I\nwas able to avoid it by inches. Or nearly so, at least. I kept my life,\nthough hair and clothes were singed.\n\n\n\nI had worked my way, involuntarily toward the press boxes, and took\ntime to shoot up a desperate glance in Suzi's direction. Her face had\nlost its coldness now; her lips were parted in fear.\n\nAlmost, I was able to smile. Suzi knew the signs--as did all the\nrest of the reporters--she'd seen too many meets not to know when a\ngladiator was using his last iota of strength and was on the verge of\ncollapse. She knew--possibly even better than I--how long I could keep\nup this pace. And then--\n\nSeeing her, recalled her way of finding a slogan, a quotation of the\nancients, for almost every situation that arose.\n\nAnd in the recalling one came to me!\n\n_Meet fire with fire._\n\nThe Centaurian was emerging from the crater where its most recent\ncharge had taken it. I ran with what speed I could muster to the\nJudges' stand and grasped one of the sacred Venusian torches that\nflanked the Judges' bench. I turned then and sped toward the enemy in\nhopes of getting him as he climbed over the crater edge.\n\nHe saw me coming and tried ineffectively to scorch me with his flaming\nbreath, but he was either growing weak, or had utilized all the fuel\nhis body produced for the effort. The flame leaped out a mere six or\neight feet.\n\nHolding the torch in hand, I dashed straight at him. As I had hoped,\none of the lobster claws darted at me. I leaped nimbly to one side,\nbounced up upon the claw and scampered up it toward the four glaring\neyes. I thrust the torch out and into them, hearing as though from a\ngreat distance, the cheer of victory that went up from the stands.\n\nThen sliding, falling, tumbling, I was on the ground again and hurrying\nas fast as possible from what I expected to be the painful, blinded\nthroes of the thing.\n\nI turned and stared. It stood there, watching me. Showing no signs of\ndistress.\n\nIt rumbled, finally, angrily, \"You can't fool me all of the time,\nTerran. Soon you will tire, then I will get you--\"\n\nSuzi's books came back to me again. What was it I was trying to\nremember? I stood there panting, realizing the ridiculousness of\nstanding exhausted in the middle of the arena and remembering odds and\nends that Suzi had told me about the ancients.\n\nAnd then, just as the Centaurian headed for me again, it clicked.\n\nA silence had settled down over the crowd. Arena wise, through years\nof watching gladiatorial events, they knew my knees were sagging, my\nreflexes slowed, my muscles screaming protest.\n\nI stood there, sword in hand, directly in its path--waiting. It had\nsaid, \"You can't fool me all of the time, Terran.\"\n\nAnd that's what had clicked.\n\n_You can fool some of the people some of the time...._\n\n\n\nPraying that I had strength enough left for this, I waited until it\nwas nearly upon me, its lobster claws out-thrust, its six heavy feet\npounding. Then I jumped, to one side, back again. I bounded high to the\nknee joint of the second limb on the left, as the Centaurian skidded\nto a halt. A second scrambling leap and I was on its back. Half on my\nfeet, half on my hands, I scampered forward toward its head, even as\nseveral tentacles made their way gropingly toward me.\n\nNo, I wasn't looking for a soft spot for my now dull sword. I knew\nthere wouldn't be any.\n\nThe tentacles were reaching, almost touching me, but I ignored them. I\nfound the tiny door right behind its massive head. I was right! I found\nthe lock and sprung it.\n\nThe door swung open and inside the tiny, leaded shielded compartment\nthe little creature occupying it looked up at me fearfully.\n\nI grasped it by the scruff of the neck and hoisted it out of its seat.\nThe \"Centaurian Gladiator\" had stopped completely now.\n\nI dropped to the ground and tossed the thing before me. It was about\nthe size of, and looked considerably like a small Terran pig. It was\npink, fat, and, as Suzi said later, cute. Right now I didn't appreciate\nits cuteness.\n\n\"Please,\" it squealed, \"don't touch me. I can't bear being hurt!\"\n\nI kicked it where its hams would have been had it really been a pig.\nIt squealed again and started out, hampered in its speed by its fat,\nrunning across the arena with me after it, giving it _kert_ with the\ntoe of my boot.\n\nIt dashed for the helicopter and I gave it one last kick as it\nscampered for the craft's door so that it flew the last four feet. In\nthe background I could hear the crowd roaring like thunder.\n\nIn seconds, the helicopter had taken off and returned to the spaceship\nabove. It was swallowed up and the Centaurian ship blasted off and\naway. Evidently, it wasn't waiting to see what the Solar System fleet\nwould do when the farce was made known.\n\nI turned, and for a moment stared at the robot the Centaurian had\noccupied. Then my injuries and fatigue caught up with me. The fog\nrolled in and I slumped to the arena sands.\n\n\n\nI explained later in the hospital room to the diplomats, the I.V.S.\nreporters, and the others. And I made the explanation as short as\npossible.\n\nIn the first place, how could a thing that big and awkward have handled\nthe helicopter so gracefully? How could _any_ organic creature survive\nthe explosion of an atomic grenade? How could it breath fire? How could\nit stand a burning torch being thrust into its eyes?\n\nBut it was the quotation that had brought it all home to me. I suddenly\nrealized I was being fooled--and another of Suzi's quotations came\nto mind. _This is a horse of another color._ Then it clicked in its\nentirety.\n\n_The Trojan Horse_, I had thought, something is inside. It's a robot, a\nmechanical fighting machine, like the tanks of old.\n\nSuddenly the diplomats and the reporters were gone and Suzi was there,\nthe star dust in her eyes again.\n\nBefore she could speak, I told her, humbly, \"You were right, Suzi, I am\na phony. I'm no champ. I was scared to death out there, when I found\nthat all the super-weapons they'd made for me were--\"\n\n\"But, _darling_, you won!\" She knelt beside the bed, but I turned my\nhead away.\n\n\"Won,\" I said bitterly. \"Sure, by a fluke again. I won against a little\nhalf pint that could have been defeated by a child.\" I snorted in\nself-deprecation. \"I wonder what the crowd out there is thinking. I\nenter the arena with enough weapons to depopulate a small planet, and\nit takes me half an hour to find out it's all a hoax.\"\n\nShe remained kneeling there, but it was another voice that said, \"The\ncrowd doesn't see it that way, Jak.\" It was Alger Wilde, who had\nentered with my manager.\n\n\"Of course not,\" Suzi insisted. \"You didn't know what you were against,\nbut you were in there all the time, taking on something worse than any\ngladiator in the System.--You proved yourself, Jak.\"\n\nAlger went to the window and opened it. \"Listen to this,\" he said\ngrudgingly. From the distance I could hear the arena crowd singing _The\nSolar System Forever_.\n\nEven Mari Nown was happy. It seemed as though the judges unanimously\nvoted to make me Interplanetary Champ for the rest of my life. The\nsituation was obvious. Terra couldn't afford to let anything happen to\nme now. As soon as I died, the next Interplanetary Meet would result in\na new champ and a new change in the balance of power. Terra wouldn't\nallow me to fight--not even in exhibitions.\n\nMari Nown's chicken head beamed as he bounced back and forth on his\nheels. \"You're going to live to a ripe old age,\" he shrilled happily,\n\"and the most dangerous thing you'll ever do is sign endorsements for\nVenusian Salt Water Taffy.\" He added, more happily still, \"And I'll get\nten percent of everything you make.\"\n\n\"Everything but Suzi,\" I told him, sticking out an arm to encircle her.\n\nAlger Wilde frowned. \"You know, Jak,\" he grunted, \"I think you're right\nabout that music. _The Solar System Forever_ is a raucous thing.\"\n\nIt was welling, ever louder, through the window.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" I said as soon as I took my lips from Suzi's. \"I'm\nbeginning to like it.\"",
