    "body": "\"Lewis,\" Martha said. \"I want to go home.\"\n\nShe didn't look at me. I followed her gaze to Earth, rising in the\neast.\n\nIt came up over the desert horizon, a clear, bright star at this\ndistance. Right now it was the Morning Star. It wasn't long before\ndawn.\n\nI looked back at Martha sitting quietly beside me with her shawl drawn\ntightly about her knees. She had waited to see it also, of course. It\nhad become almost a ritual with us these last few years, staying up\nnight after night to watch the earthrise.\n\nShe didn't say anything more. Even the gentle squeak of her rocking\nchair had fallen silent. Only her hands moved. I could see them\ntrembling where they lay folded in her lap, trembling with emotion and\ntiredness and old age. I knew what she was thinking. After seventy\nyears there can be no secrets.\n\nWe sat on the glassed-in veranda of our Martian home looking up at the\nMorning Star. To us it wasn't a point of light. It was the continents\nand oceans of Earth, the mountains and meadows and laughing streams of\nour childhood. We saw Earth still, though we had lived on Mars for\nalmost sixty-six years.\n\n\"Lewis,\" Martha whispered softly. \"It's very bright tonight, isn't\nit?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.\n\n\"It seems so near.\"\n\nShe sighed and drew the shawl higher about her waist.\n\n\"Only three months by rocket ship,\" she said. \"We could be back home\nin three months, Lewis, if we went out on this week's run.\"\n\nI nodded. For years we'd watched the rocket ships streak upward\nthrough the thin Martian atmosphere, and we'd envied the men who so\ncasually travelled from world to world. But it had been a useless\nenvy, something of which we rarely spoke.\n\nInside our veranda the air was cool and slightly moist. Earth air,\nperfumed with the scent of Earth roses. Yet we knew it was only\nillusion. Outside, just beyond the glass, the cold night air of Mars\nlay thin and alien and smelling of alkali. It seemed to me tonight\nthat I could smell that ever-dry Martian dust, even here. I sighed,\nfumbling for my pipe.\n\n\"Lewis,\" Martha said, very softly.\n\n\"What is it?\" I cupped my hands over the match flame.\n\n\"Nothing. It's just that I wish--I wish we _could_ go home, right\naway. Home to Earth. I want to see it again, before we die.\"\n\n\"We'll go back,\" I said. \"Next year for sure. We'll have enough money\nthen.\"\n\nShe sighed. \"Next year may be too late.\"\n\nI looked over at her, startled. She'd never talked like that before. I\nstarted to protest, but the words died away before I could even speak\nthem. She was right. Next year might indeed be too late.\n\nHer work-coarsened hands were thin, too thin, and they never stopped\nshaking any more. Her body was a frail shadow of what it had once\nbeen. Even her voice was frail now.\n\nShe was old. We were both old. There wouldn't be many more Martian\nsummers for us, nor many years of missing Earth.\n\n\"Why can't we go back this year, Lewis?\"\n\nShe smiled at me almost apologetically. She knew the reason as well as\nI did.\n\n\"We can't,\" I said. \"There's not enough money.\"\n\n\"There's enough for our tickets.\"\n\nI'd explained all that to her before, too. Perhaps she'd forgotten.\nLately I often had to explain things more than once.\n\n\"You can't buy passage unless you have enough extra for insurance, and\ntravelers' checks, and passport tax. The company has to protect\nitself. Unless you're financially responsible, they won't take you on\nthe ships.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"Sometimes I wonder if we'll ever have enough.\"\n\n\n\nWe'd saved our money for years, but it was a pitifully small savings.\nWe weren't rich people who could go down to the spaceport and buy\npassage on the rocket ships, no questions asked, no bond required. We\nwere only farmers, eking our livelihood from the unproductive Martian\nsoil, only two of the countless little people of the solar system. In\nall our lifetime we'd never been able to save enough to go home to\nEarth.\n\n\"One more year,\" I said. \"If the crop prices stay up....\"\n\nShe smiled, a sad little smile that didn't reach her eyes. \"Yes,\nLewis,\" she said. \"One more year.\"\n\nBut I couldn't stop thinking of what she'd said earlier, nor stop\nseeing her thin, tired body. Neither of us was strong any more, but of\nthe two I was far stronger than she.\n\nWhen we'd left Earth she'd been as eager and graceful as a child. We\nhadn't been much past childhood then, either of us....\n\n\"Sometimes I wonder why we ever came here,\" she said.\n\n\"It's been a good life.\"\n\nShe sighed. \"I know. But now that it's nearly over, there's nothing to\nhold us here.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"There's not.\"\n\nIf we had had children it might have been different. As it was, we\nlived surrounded by the children and grandchildren of our friends. Our\nfriends themselves were dead. One by one they had died, all of those\nwho came with us on the first colonizing ship to Mars. All of those\nwho came later, on the second and third ships. Their children were our\nneighbors now--and they were Martian born. It wasn't the same.\n\nShe leaned over and pressed my hand. \"We'd better go in, Lewis,\" she\nsaid. \"We need our sleep.\"\n\nHer eyes were raised again to the green star that was Earth. Watching\nher, I knew that I loved her now as much as when we had been young\ntogether. More, really, for we had added years of shared memories. I\nwanted so much to give her what she longed for, what we both longed\nfor. But I couldn't think of any way to do it. Not this year.\n\nOnce, almost seventy years before, I had smiled at the girl who had\njust promised to become my wife, and I'd said: \"I'll give you the\nworld, darling. All tied up in pink ribbons.\"\n\nI didn't want to think about that now.\n\nWe got up and went into the house and shut the veranda door behind us.\n\n\n\nI couldn't go to sleep. For hours I lay in bed staring up at the\nshadowed ceiling, trying to think of some way to raise the money. But\nthere wasn't any way that I could see. It would be at least eight\nmonths before enough of the greenhouse crops were harvested.\n\nWhat would happen, I wondered, if I went to the spaceport and asked\nfor tickets? If I explained that we couldn't buy insurance, that we\ncouldn't put up the bond guaranteeing we wouldn't become public\ncharges back on Earth.... But all the time I wondered I knew the\nanswer. Rules were rules. They wouldn't be broken especially not for\ntwo old farmers who had long outlived their usefulness and their time.\n\nMartha sighed in her sleep and turned over. It was light enough now\nfor me to see her face clearly. She was smiling. But a minute ago she\nhad been crying, for the tears were still wet on her cheeks.\n\nPerhaps she was dreaming of Earth again.\n\nSuddenly, watching her, I didn't care if they laughed at me or\nlectured me on my responsibilities to the government as if I were a\nsenile fool. I was going to the spaceport. I was going to find out if,\nsomehow, we couldn't go back.\n\nI got up and dressed and went out, walking softly so as not to awaken\nher. But even so she heard me and called out to me.\n\n\"Lewis....\"\n\nI turned at the head of the stairs and looked back into the room.\n\n\"Don't get up, Martha,\" I said. \"I'm going into town.\"\n\n\"All right, Lewis.\"\n\nShe relaxed, and a minute later she was asleep again. I tiptoed\ndownstairs and out the front door to where the trike car was parked,\nand started for the village a mile to the west.\n\nIt was desert all the way. Dry, fine red sand that swirled upward in\nchoking clouds, if you stepped off the pavement into it. The narrow\nroad cut straight through it, linking the outlying district farms to\nthe town. The farms themselves were planted in the desert. Small,\nglassed-in houses and barns, and large greenhouses roofed with even\nmore glass, that sheltered the Earth plants and gave them Earth air to\nbreathe.\n\n\n\nWhen I came to the second farmhouse John Emery hurried out to meet me.\n\n\"Morning, Lewis,\" he said. \"Going to town?\"\n\nI shut off the motor and nodded. \"I want to catch the early shuttle\nplane to the spaceport,\" I said. \"I'm going to the city to buy some\nthings....\"\n\nI had to lie about it. I didn't want anyone to know we were even\nthinking of leaving, at least not until we had our tickets in our\nhands.\n\n\"Oh,\" Emery said. \"That's right. I suppose you'll be buying Martha an\nanniversary present.\"\n\nI stared at him blankly. I couldn't think what anniversary he meant.\n\n\"You'll have been here thirty-five years next week,\" he said. \"That's\na long time, Lewis....\"\n\nThirty-five years. It took me a minute to realize what he meant. He\nwas right. That was how long we had been here, in Martian years.\n\nThe others, those who had been born here on Mars, always used the\nMartian seasons. We had too, once. But lately we forgot, and counted\nin Earth time. It seemed more natural.\n\n\"Wait a minute, Lewis,\" Emery said. \"I'll ride into the village with\nyou. There's plenty of time for you to make your plane.\"\n\nI went up on his veranda and sat down and waited for him to get ready.\nI leaned back in the swing chair and rocked slowly back and forth,\nwondering idly how many times I'd sat here.\n\nThis was old Tom Emery's house. Or had been, until he died eight years\nago. He'd built this swing chair the very first year we'd been on\nMars.\n\nNow it was young John's. Young? That showed how old we were getting.\nJohn was sixty-three, in Earth years. He'd been born that second\nwinter, the month the parasites got into the greenhouses....\n\nHe came back out onto the veranda. \"Well, I'm ready, Lewis,\" he said.\n\nWe went down to my trike car and got in.\n\n\"You and Martha ought to get out more,\" he said. \"Jenny's been asking\nme why you don't come to call.\"\n\nI shrugged. I couldn't tell him we seldom went out because when we\ndid we were always set apart and treated carefully, like children. He\nprobably didn't even realize that it was so.\n\n\"Oh,\" I said. \"We like it at home.\"\n\nHe smiled. \"I suppose you do, after thirty-five years.\"\n\nI started the motor quickly, and from then on concentrated on my\ndriving. He didn't say anything more.\n\n\n\nIt took only a few minutes to get to the village, but even so I was\ntired. Lately it grew harder and harder to drive, to keep the trike\ncar on the narrow strip of pavement. I was glad when we pulled up in\nthe square and got out.\n\n\"I'll walk over to the plane with you,\" Emery said. \"I've got plenty\nof time.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\n\"By the way, Lewis, Jenny and I and some of the neighbors thought we'd\ndrop over on your anniversary.\"\n\n\"That's fine,\" I said, trying to sound enthusiastic. \"Come on over.\"\n\n\"It's a big event,\" he said. \"Deserves a celebration.\"\n\nThe shuttle plane was just landing. I hurried over to the ticket\nwindow, with him right beside me.\n\n\"I just wanted to be sure you'd be home,\" he said. \"We wouldn't want\nyou to miss your own party.\"\n\n\"Party?\" I said. \"But John--\"\n\nHe wouldn't even let me finish protesting.\n\n\"Now don't ask any questions, Lewis. You wouldn't want to spoil the\nsurprise, would you?\"\n\nHe chuckled. \"Your plane's loading now. You'd better be going. Thanks\nfor the ride, Lewis.\"\n\nI went across to the plane and got in. I hoped that somehow we\nwouldn't have to spend that Martian anniversary being congratulated\nand petted and babied. I didn't think Martha could stand it. But there\nwasn't any polite way to say no.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't a long trip to the spaceport. In less than an hour the plane\ndropped down to the air strip that flanked the rocket field. But it\nwas like flying from one civilization to another.\n\nThe city was big, almost like an Earth city. There was lots of\ntraffic, cars and copters and planes. All the bustle of the spaceways\nstations.\n\nBut although the city looked like Earth, it smelled as dry and\nalkaline as all the rest of Mars.\n\nI found the ticket office easily enough and went in. The young clerk\nbarely glanced up at me. \"Yes?\" he said.\n\n\"I want to inquire about tickets to Earth,\" I said.\n\nMy hands were sweating, and I could feel my heart pounding too fast\nagainst my ribs. But my voice sounded casual, just the way I wanted it\nto sound.\n\n\"Tickets?\" the clerk said. \"How many?\"\n\n\"Two. How much would they cost? Everything included.\"\n\n\"Forty-two eighty,\" he said. His voice was still bored. \"I could give\nthem to you for the flight after next. Tourist class, of course....\"\n\nWe didn't have that much. We were at least three hundred short.\n\n\"Isn't there any way,\" I said hesitantly, \"that I could get them for\nless? I mean, we wouldn't need insurance, would we?\"\n\nHe looked up at me for the first time, startled. \"You don't mean you\nwant them for yourself, do you?\"\n\n\"Why yes. For me and my wife.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"I'm sorry,\" he said flatly. \"But that would be\nimpossible in any case. You're too old.\"\n\nHe turned away from me and bent over his desk work again.\n\nThe words hung in the air. Too old ... too old ... I clutched the edge\nof the desk and steadied myself and forced down the panic I could feel\nrising.\n\n\"Do you mean,\" I said slowly, \"that you wouldn't sell us tickets even\nif we had the money?\"\n\nHe glanced up again, obviously annoyed at my persistence. \"That's\nright. No passengers over seventy carried without special visas.\nMedical precaution.\"\n\nI just stood there. This couldn't be happening. Not after all our\nyears of working and saving and planning for the future. Not go back.\nNot even next year. Stay here, because we were old and frail and the\nships wouldn't be bothered with us anyway.\n\nMartha.... How could I tell her? How could I say, \"We can't go home,\nMartha. They won't let us.\"\n\nI couldn't say it. There had to be some other way.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" I said to the clerk, \"but who should I see about getting\na visa?\"\n\nHe swept the stack of papers away with an impatient gesture and\nfrowned up at me.\n\n\"Over at the colonial office, I suppose,\" he said. \"But it won't do\nyou any good.\"\n\nI could read in his eyes what he thought of me. Of me and all the\nother farmers who lived in the outlying districts and raised crops and\nseldom came to the city. My clothes were old and provincial and out of\nstyle, and so was I, to him.\n\n\"I'll try it anyway,\" I said.\n\nHe started to say something, then bit it back and looked away from me\nagain. I was keeping him from his work. I was just a rude old man\ninterfering with the operation of the spaceways.\n\nSlowly I let go of the desk and turned to leave. It was hard to walk.\nMy knees were trembling, and my whole body shook. It was all I could\ndo not to cry. It angered me, the quavering in my voice and the\nweakness in my legs.\n\nI went out into the hall and looked for the directory that would point\nthe way to the colonial office. It wasn't far off.\n\nI walked out onto the edge of the field and past the Earth rocket, its\nsilver nose pointed up at the sky. I couldn't bear to look at it for\nlonger than a minute.\n\nIt was only a few hundred yards to the colonial office, but it seemed\nlike miles.\n\n\n\nThis office was larger than the other, and much more comfortable. The\nman seated behind the desk seemed friendlier too.\n\n\"May I help you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said slowly. \"The man at the ticket office told me to come\nhere. I wanted to see about getting a permit to go back to Earth....\"\n\nHis smile faded. \"For yourself?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said woodenly. \"For myself and my wife.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr....\"\n\n\"Farwell. Lewis Farwell.\"\n\n\"My name's Duane. Please sit down, won't you?... How old are you, Mr.\nFarwell?\"\n\n\"Eighty-seven,\" I said. \"In Earth years.\"\n\nHe frowned. \"The regulations say no space travel for people past\nseventy, except in certain special cases....\"\n\nI looked down at my hands. They were shaking badly. I knew he could\nsee them shake, and was judging me as old and weak and unable to stand\nthe trip. He couldn't know why I was trembling.\n\n\"Please,\" I whispered. \"It wouldn't matter if it hurt us. It's just\nthat we want to see Earth again. It's been so long....\"\n\n\"How long have you been here, Mr. Farwell?\" It was merely politeness.\nThere wasn't any promise in his voice.\n\n\"Sixty-five years.\" I looked up at him. \"Isn't there some way--\"\n\n\"Sixty-five years? But that means you must have come here on the first\ncolonizing ship.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"We did.\"\n\n\"I can't believe it,\" he said slowly. \"I can't believe I'm actually\nlooking at one of the pioneers.\" He shook his head. \"I didn't even\nknow any of them were still on Mars.\"\n\n\"We're the last ones,\" I said. \"That's the main reason we want to go\nback. It's awfully hard staying on when your friends are dead.\"\n\n\n\nDuane got up and crossed the room to the window and looked out over\nthe rocket field.\n\n\"But what good would it do to go back, Mr. Farwell?\" he asked. \"Earth\nhas changed very much in the last sixty-five years.\"\n\nHe was trying to soften the disappointment. But nothing could. If only\nI could make him realize that.\n\n\"I know it's changed,\" I said. \"But it's _home_. Don't you see? We're\nEarthmen still. I guess that never changes. And now that we're old,\nwe're aliens here.\"\n\n\"We're all aliens here, Mr. Farwell.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said desperately. \"Maybe you are. Maybe a lot of the city\npeople are. But our neighbors were born on Mars. To them Earth is a\nlegend. A place where their ancestors once lived. It's not real to\nthem....\"\n\nHe turned and crossed the room and came back to me. His smile was\npitying. \"If you went back,\" he said, \"you'd find you were a Martian,\ntoo.\"\n\nI couldn't reach him. He was friendly and pleasant and he was trying\nto make things easier, and it wasn't any use talking. I bent my head\nand choked back the sobs I could feel rising in my throat.\n\n\"You've lived a full life,\" Duane said. \"You were one of the pioneers.\nI remember reading about your ship when I was a boy, and wishing I'd\nbeen born sooner so that I could have been on it.\"\n\nSlowly I raised my head and looked up at him.\n\n\"Please,\" I said. \"I know that. I'm glad we came here. If we had our\nlives to live over, we'd come again. We'd go through all the\nhardships of those first few years, and enjoy them just as much. We'd\nbe just as thrilled over proving that it's possible to farm a world\nlike this, where it's always freezing and the air is thin and nothing\nwill grow outside the greenhouses. You don't need to tell me what\nwe've done, or what we've gotten out of it. We know. We've had a\nwonderful life here.\"\n\n\"But you still want to go back?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"We still want to go back. We're tired of living in the\npast, with our friends dead and nothing to do except remember.\"\n\nHe looked at me for a long moment. Then he said slowly, \"You realize,\ndon't you, that if you went back to Earth you'd have to stay there?\nYou couldn't return to Mars....\"\n\n\"I realize that,\" I said. \"That's what we want. We want to die at\nhome. On Earth.\"\n\n\n\nFor a long, long moment his eyes never left mine. Then, slowly, he sat\ndown at his desk and reached for a pen.\n\n\"All right, Mr. Farwell,\" he said. \"I'll give you a visa.\"\n\nI couldn't believe it. I stared at him, sure that I'd misunderstood.\n\n\"Sixty-five years....\" He shook his head. \"I only hope I'm doing the\nright thing. I hope you won't regret this.\"\n\n\"We won't,\" I whispered.\n\nThen I remembered that we were still short of money. That that was why\nI'd come to the spaceport originally. I was almost afraid to mention\nit, for fear I'd lose everything.\n\n\"Is there--is there some way we could be excused from the insurance?\"\nI said. \"So we could go back this year? We're three hundred short.\"\n\nHe smiled. It was a very reassuring smile. \"You don't need to worry\nabout the money,\" he said. \"The colonial office can take care of that.\nAfter all, we owe your generation a great debt, Mr. Farwell. A\npassport tax and the fare to Earth are little enough to pay for a\nplanet.\"\n\nI didn't quite understand him, but that didn't matter. The only thing\nthat mattered was that we were going home. Back to Earth. I could see\nMartha's face when I told her. I could see her tears of happiness....\n\nThere were tears on my own cheeks, but I wasn't ashamed of them now.\n\n\"Mr. Farwell,\" Duane said. \"You go back home. The shuttle ship will be\nleaving in a few minutes.\"\n\n\"You mean that--\" I started.\n\nHe nodded. \"I'll get your tickets for you. On the first ship I can.\nJust leave it to me.\"\n\n\"It's too much trouble,\" I protested.\n\n\"No it's not.\" He smiled. \"Besides, I'd like to bring them out to you.\nI'd like to see your farm, if I may.\"\n\nThen I remembered what John Emery had said this morning about our\nanniversary. It would be a wonderful celebration, now that there was\nsomething to celebrate. We could even save our announcement that we\nwere going home until then.\n\n\"Mr. Duane,\" I said. \"Next week, on the tenth, we'll have been here\nthirty-five Martian years. Maybe you'd like to come out then. I guess\nour neighbors will be giving us a sort of party.\"\n\nHe laid the pen down and looked at me very intently. \"They don't know\nyou're planning to leave yet, do they?\"\n\n\"No. We'll wait and tell them then.\"\n\nDuane nodded slowly. \"I'll be there,\" he promised.\n\n\n\nMartha was out on the veranda again, looking down the road toward the\nvillage. All afternoon at least one of us had been out there watching\nfor our guests, waiting for our anniversary celebration to begin.\n\n\"Do you see anyone yet?\" I called.\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"Not yet....\"\n\nI looked around the room hoping I'd find something left undone that I\ncould work on, so I wouldn't have to sit and worry about the\npossibility of Duane's having forgotten us. But everything was ready.\nThe extra chairs were out and the furniture all dusted, and Martha's\ncakes and cookies arranged on the table.\n\nI couldn't sit still. Not today. I got up out of the chair and joined\nher on the veranda.\n\n\"I wonder what their surprise is....\" she said. \"Didn't John give you\nany hint at all?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"But whatever it is, it can't be half as wonderful as\nours.\"\n\nShe reached for my hand. \"Lewis,\" she whispered. \"I can hardly believe\nit, can you?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"But it's true. We're really going.\"\n\nI put my arm around her, and she rested her head against me.\n\n\"I'm so happy, Lewis.\"\n\nHer cheeks were full of color once again, and her step had a spring to\nit that I hadn't seen for years. It was as if the years of waiting\nwere falling away from both of us now.\n\n\"I wish they'd come,\" she said. \"I can hardly wait to see their faces\nwhen we tell them.\"\n\nIt was getting late in the afternoon. Already the sun was dipping down\ntoward the desert horizon. It was hard to wait. In some ways it was\nharder to be patient these last few hours than it had been during all\nthose years we'd wanted to go back.\n\n\"Look,\" Martha said suddenly. \"There's a car now.\"\n\nThen I saw the car too, coming quickly toward us. It pulled up in\nfront of the house and stopped and Duane stepped out.\n\n\"Well, hello there, Mr. Farwell,\" he called. \"All ready for the trip?\"\n\nI nodded. Suddenly, now that he was here, I couldn't say anything at\nall.\n\nHe must have seen how excited we were. By the time he was inside the\nveranda door he'd reached into his wallet and pulled out a long\nenvelope.\n\n\"Here's your schedule,\" he said. \"Your tickets are all made out for\nnext week's flight.\"\n\nMartha's hand crept into mine. \"You've been so kind,\" she whispered.\n\n\n\nWe went into the house and smiled at each other while Duane admired\nthe furniture and the farming district in general and our place in\nparticular. We hardly heard what he was saying.\n\nWhen the doorbell rang we stared at each other. For a minute I\ncouldn't think who it might be. I'd forgotten our guests and their\nsurprise party, even the anniversary itself had slipped my mind.\n\n\"Hello in there,\" John Emery called. \"Come on out, you two.\"\n\nMartha pressed my hand once more. Then she stepped to the door and\nopened it.\n\n\"Happy anniversary!\"\n\nWe stood frozen. We'd expected only a few visitors, some of our\nnearest neighbors. But the yard was full of people. They crowded up\nour walk and in the road and more of them were still piling out of\ncars. It looked as if everyone in the district was along.\n\n\"Come on out,\" Emery called. \"You too, Duane.\"\n\nThe two men smiled at each other knowingly, and for just a moment I\nhad time to wonder why.\n\nThen Martha clutched my arm. \"You tell him, Lewis.\"\n\n\"John,\" I said. \"We have a surprise for you too--\"\n\nHe wouldn't let me finish. He took hold of my arm with one hand and\nMartha's with the other and drew us outside where everyone could see\nus.\n\n\"You can tell us later, Lewis,\" he said, \"First we have a surprise for\nyou!\"\n\n\"But wait--\"\n\nThey crowded in around us, laughing and waving and calling \"Happy\nanniversary\". We couldn't resist them. They swept us along with them\ndown the walk and into one of the cars.\n\nI looked around for Duane. He was in the back seat, smiling somewhat\nnervously. Perhaps he thought that this was normal farm life.\n\n\"Lewis,\" Martha said, \"where are they taking us?\"\n\n\"I don't know....\"\n\nThe cars started, ours leading the way. It was a regular procession\nback to the village, with everyone laughing and calling to us and\ntelling us how happy we were going to be with our surprise. Every time\nwe tried to ask questions, John Emery interrupted.\n\n\"Just wait and see,\" he kept saying. \"Wait and see....\"\n\n\n\nAt the end of the village square they'd put up a platform. It wasn't\nvery big, nor very well made, but it was strung with yards of bunting\nand a huge sign that said, \"Happy Anniversary, Lewis and Martha.\"\n\nWe were pushed toward it, carried along by the swarm of people. There\nwasn't any way to resist. Martha clung to my arm, pressing close\nagainst me. She was trembling again.\n\n\"What does it mean, Lewis?\"\n\n\"I wish I knew.\"\n\nThey pushed us right up onto the platform and John Emery followed us\nup and held out his hand to quiet the crowd. I put my arm around\nMartha and looked down at them. Hundreds of people. All in their best\nclothes. Our friends's children and grandchildren, and even\ngreat-grandchildren.\n\n\"I won't make a speech,\" John Emery said when they were finally quiet.\n\"You know why we're here today--all of you except Lewis and Martha\nknow. It's an anniversary. A big anniversary. Thirty-five years today\nsince our fathers--and you two--landed here on Mars....\"\n\nHe paused. He didn't seem to know what to say next. Finally he turned\nand swept his arm past the platform to where a big canvas-covered\nobject stood on the ground.\n\n\"Unveil it,\" he said.\n\nThe crowd grew absolutely quiet. A couple of boys stepped up and\npulled the canvas off.\n\n\"There's your surprise,\" John Emery said softly.\n\nIt was a statue. A life-size statue carved from the dull red stone of\nMars. Two figures, a man and a woman, dressed in farm clothes,\nstanding side by side and looking out across the square toward the\nopen desert.\n\nThey were very real, those figures. Real, and somehow familiar.\n\n\"Lewis,\" Martha whispered. \"They're--they're us!\"\n\nShe was right. It was a statue of us. Neither old nor young, but\nageless. Two farmers, looking out forever across the endless Martian\ndesert....\n\nThere was an inscription on the base, but I couldn't quite make it\nout. Martha could. She read it, slowly, while everyone in the crowd\nstood silent, listening.\n\n\"Lewis and Martha Farwell,\" she read. \"The last of the pioneers--\" Her\nvoice broke. \"Underneath,\" she whispered, \"it says--the first\nMartians. And then it lists them--us....\"\n\nShe read the list, all the names of our friends who had come out on\nthat first ship. The names of men and women who had died, one by one,\nand left their farms to their children--to the same children who now\ncrowded close about the platform and listened to her read, and smiled\nup at us.\n\nShe came to the end of the list and looked out at the crowd. \"Thank\nyou,\" she whispered.\n\nThey shouted then. They called out to us and pressed forward and held\ntheir babies up to see us.\n\n\n\nI looked out past the people, across the flat red desert to the\nhorizon, toward the spot in the east where the Earth would rise, much\nlater. The dry smell of Mars had never been stronger.\n\nThe first Martians....\n\nThey were so real, those carved figures. Lewis and Martha Farwell....\n\n\"Look at them, Lewis,\" Martha said softly. \"They're cheering us. Us!\"\n\nShe was smiling. There were tears in her eyes, but her smile was\nbright and proud and shining. Slowly she turned away from me and\nstraightened, staring out over the heads of the crowd across the\ndesert to the east. She stood with her head thrown back and her mouth\nsmiling, and she was as proudly erect as the statue that was her\nlikeness.\n\n\"Martha,\" I whispered. \"How can we tell them goodbye?\"\n\nThen she turned to face me, and I could see the tears glistening in\nher eyes. \"We can't leave, Lewis. Not after this.\"\n\nShe was right, of course. We couldn't leave. We were symbols. The last\nof the pioneers. The first Martians. And they had carved their symbol\nin our image and made us a part of Mars forever.\n\nI glanced down, along the rows of upturned, laughing faces, searching\nfor Duane. He was easy to find. He was the only one who wasn't\nshouting. His eyes met mine, and I didn't have to say anything. He\nknew. He climbed up beside me on the platform.\n\nI tried to speak, but I couldn't.\n\n\"Tell him, Lewis,\" Martha whispered. \"Tell him we can't go.\"\n\nThen she was crying. Her smile was gone and her proud look was gone\nand her hand crept into mine and trembled there. I put my arm around\nher shoulders, but there was no way I could comfort her.\n\n\"Now we'll never go,\" she sobbed. \"We'll never get home....\"\n\nI don't think I had ever realized, until that moment, just how much it\nmeant to her--getting home. Much more, perhaps, than it had ever meant\nto me.\n\nThe statues were only statues. They were carved from the stone of\nMars. And Martha wanted Earth. We both wanted Earth. Home....\n\nI looked away from her then, back to Duane. \"No,\" I said. \"We're still\ngoing. Only--\" I broke off, hearing the shouting and the cheers and\nthe children's laughter. \"Only, how can we tell _them_?\"\n\nDuane smiled. \"Don't try to, Mr. Farwell,\" he said softly. \"Just wait\nand see.\"\n\nHe turned, nodded to where John Emery still stood at the edge of the\nplatform. \"All right, John.\"\n\nEmery nodded too, and then he raised his hand. As he did so, the\nshouting stopped and the people stood suddenly quiet, still looking up\nat us.\n\n\"You all know that this is an anniversary,\" John Emery said. \"And you\nall know something else that Lewis and Martha thought they'd kept as a\nsurprise--that this is more than an anniversary. It's goodbye.\"\n\nI stared at him. He knew. All of them knew. And then I looked at Duane\nand saw that he was smiling more than ever.\n\n\"They've lived here on Mars for thirty-five years,\" John Emery said.\n\"And now they're going back to Earth.\"\n\nMartha's hand tightened on mine. \"Look, Lewis,\" she cried. \"Look at\nthem. They're not angry. They're--they're happy for us!\"\n\nJohn Emery turned to face us. \"Surprised?\" he said.\n\nI nodded. Martha nodded too. Behind him, the people cheered again.\n\n\"I thought you would be,\" Emery said. Then, \"I'm not very good at\nspeeches, but I just wanted you to know how much we've enjoyed being\nyour neighbors. Don't forget us when you get back to Earth.\"\n\n\n\nIt was a long, long trip from Mars to Earth. Three months on the ship,\nthirty-five million miles. A trip we had dreamed about for so long,\nwithout any real hope of ever making it. But now it was over. We were\nback on Earth. Back where we had started from.\n\n\"It's good to be alone, isn't it, Lewis?\" Martha leaned back in her\nchair and smiled up at me.\n\nI nodded. It did feel good to be here in the apartment, just the two\nof us, away from the crowds and the speeches and the official welcomes\nand the flashbulbs popping.\n\n\"I wish they wouldn't make such a fuss over us,\" she said. \"I wish\nthey'd leave us alone.\"\n\n\"You can't blame them,\" I said, although I couldn't help wishing the\nsame thing. \"We're celebrities. What was it that reporter said about\nus? That we're part of history....\"\n\nShe sighed. She turned away from me and looked out the window again,\npast the buildings and the lighted traffic ramps and the throngs of\npeople bustling by outside, people who couldn't see in through the\none-way glass, people whom we couldn't hear because the room was\nsoundproofed.\n\n\"Mars should be up by now,\" she said.\n\n\"It probably is.\" I looked out again, although I knew that we would\nsee nothing. No stars. No planets. Not even the moon, except as a pale\nhalf disc peering through the haze. The lights from the city were too\nbright. The air held the light and reflected it down again, and the\nsky was a deep, dark blue with the buildings about us towering into\nit, outlined blackly against it. And we couldn't see the stars....\n\n\"Lewis,\" Martha said slowly. \"I never thought it would have changed\nthis much, did you?\"\n\n\"No.\" I couldn't tell from her voice whether she liked the changes or\nnot. Lately I couldn't tell much of anything from her voice. And\nnothing was the same as we had remembered it.\n\nEven the Earth farms were mechanized now. Factory production lines for\nfood, as well as for everything else. It was necessary, of course. We\nhad heard all the reasons, all the theories, all the latest\nstatistics.\n\n\"I guess I'll go to bed soon,\" Martha said. \"I'm tired.\"\n\n\"It's the higher gravity.\" We'd both been tired since we got back to\nEarth. We had forgotten, over the years, what Earth gravity was like.\n\nShe hesitated. She smiled at me, but her eyes were worried.\n\"Lewis--are you really glad we came back?\"\n\nIt was the first time she had asked me that. And there was only one\nanswer I could give her. The one she expected.\n\n\"Of course, Martha....\"\n\nShe sighed again. She got up out of the chair and turned toward the\nbedroom door, and then she paused there by the window looking out at\nthe deep blue sky.\n\n\"Are you really glad, Lewis?\"\n\nThen I knew. Or, at least, I hoped. \"Why, Martha? Aren't you?\"\n\nFor one long minute she stood beside me, looking up at the Mars we\ncouldn't see. And then she turned to face me once again, and I could\nsee the tears.\n\n\"Oh, Lewis, I want to go home!\"\n\nFull circle. We had both come full circle these last few hectic weeks\non Earth.\n\n\"So do I, Martha.\"\n\n\"Do you, Lewis?\" And then the tiredness came back to her eyes and she\nlooked away again. \"But of course we can't.\"\n\nSlowly I crossed over to the desk and opened the top drawer and took\nout the folder that Duane had given me, that last day at the\nspaceport, just before our ship to Earth had blasted off. Slowly I\nunfolded the paper that Duane had told me to keep in case we ever\nwanted it.\n\n\"Yes, we can, Martha. We can go back.\"\n\n\"What's that, Lewis?\" And then she saw what it was. Her face came\nalive again, and her eyes were shining. \"We're going home?\" she\nwhispered. \"We're really going home?\"\n\nI looked down at the Earth-Mars half of the round trip ticket that\nDuane had given me, and I knew that this time she was right.\n\nThis time we'd really be going home.\n\nTHE END\n\n",
