    "body": "The time was when the T. M. O. Transportation Co. occupied a proud\nposition in the latest infant industry--aerial passenger carrying.\n\nThe T., who was Jim Tyler; the M., Burt Minster; and the O., Delevan\nO\u2019Connell, each had a plane of his own. The company leased a field on the\nedge of a sizable little city and erected hangars. No less than three\nmechanics labored to keep the ships in the air.\n\nThe three partners had a bank account and a growing clientele among the\nmore progressive members of the community. They had carried doctors to\npatients, ministers to congregations and judges to court. Yes, undoubtedly\nthe T. M. O. Transportation Co. was the peer of any aeronautical outfit in\nthe country.\n\nAs Del O\u2019Connell put it, in one of his prophetic moods--\n\n\u201cThe day will come when T. M. O. means as much in this country as C. O.\nD.\u201d\n\nThat was rather strong, perhaps too strong, for not three days later,\nquite without reason, Del\u2019s motor threw a connecting rod clean through the\ncrankcase. In the consequent forced landing in a pasture some distance\nfrom the field, he cracked two struts of his landing carriage in a\nsuccessful effort to save the wings.\n\n                       FALLS THREE THOUSAND FEET;\n                                LIVES\n\nwas what the morning paper shouted to the city at large, and the growing\nclientele shriveled like a violet on a griddle, and the bank account was\nnot slow in following it. Of course Del O\u2019Connell hadn\u2019t fallen an inch;\nhe had merely glided down without motor; but how are you going to explain\nthat to a headline-reading public. It worried him, however, that the\ncracking of two struts should split their little business to its\nfoundations. And he prophesied no more.\n\nAt last the T. M. O. Transportation Co. loaded itself into the two good\nships remaining, left two of the mechanics behind and departed for fresh\nfields.\n\nAt another town, smaller than the first, they had pitched their tents and\ntaken a field--by the month. The hard work of building up reputation in a\nbusiness generally considered the apex of the risky was begun again. They\ncarried hundreds of passengers in safety. Not once did one of the pilots\nyield to the desire for a jazz ride and tailspin a ship or even roll it\nover once or twice. The strict aeronautical aristocrats consider such\nantics in commercial flying equivalent to the employment of a puller-in\noutside the store in the retail clothing business.\n\nProspects were good, though the company was not yet prosperous. Then, one\nmorning when Burt Minster took off alone to test-hop his ship, he banked a\nbit too much just after leaving the ground and came down in a side-slip\nthat completely washed out his plane and left him in the wreckage with a\nsplit ear and a bad headache.\n\nThat reduced the T. M. O. Transportation Co.\u2019s assets to Jim Tyler\u2019s\nancient training-ship. They moved on, minus the last mechanic. They were\nno longer an organization with a fixed base, a reputation and a bank. They\nhad descended in the world to the low estate of gipsy fliers, winging\nhither and yon, picking up such business as presented itself and landing\nin more cornfields than in airdromes.\n\nYes, they learned about flying from those cornfields--more than a pilot\nwill ever know who always has four hundred yards or so of neatly groomed\nturf in front of him to set his ship down on, but it didn\u2019t help their\nself-esteem any.\n\nAnd in Burt Minster\u2019s big head grew the conviction that if he hadn\u2019t\nside-slipped his bus in that silly way, the company wouldn\u2019t have dropped\nso low in the scale. He had made them aeronautical hoboes.\n\nThe day arrived when an offer came from the Baychester Fair for a\nstunt-flying, wing-walking, parachute-dropping exhibition. The three\npartners grasped it eagerly. Stunting a ship, walking around on wings and\nfuselage with a desert of space under you and dropping overboard with only\nthin silk between you and the next world are all hazardous propositions,\nbut not nearly so hazardous as consistently going without food. It was\nhard on their pride, of course, for they remembered the time, only days\nbehind them, when no money would have tempted them to descend so low as to\nindulge in thrillers to drag a crowd into a fair grounds. They were--had\nbeen--in the transportation, not the Desperate Desmond, business.\n\nThe contract was couched in terms that permitted them to kill themselves\nwithout incurring the animosity of one Jenkins, manager of the fair,\nprovided that they did it in a spectacular and public manner. In return\nfor this concession, they extracted sufficient cash from Jenkins to buy\ntwo parachutes and three square meals.\n\nAnd here they were, in an old shack within the mile track of the\nBaychester Fair Grounds on the evening before opening day, with discord\nrampant in their ranks, and threatening to blow the company into its three\ncomponent parts.\n\nAt one end of the rickety table sat Delevan O\u2019Connell, a slender, animated\nyoung man. His wiry body was so short that he was compelled to lean\nforward on his elbows in order to raise his angry blue eyes above the two\nbrand new parachute packs on the table and focus them on the big form of\nBurt Minster. Burt scowled back at him.\n\n\u201cOh, shut your traps, both of you,\u201d growled Jim Tyler, bestowing an\nimpartial glare on his two partners. \u201cWhat difference does it make which\nof you does the first jump?\u201d\n\nThe gist of the trouble was this: Both O\u2019Connell and Minster felt\nresponsible for the straits in which the company found itself, and\ntherefore each man aspired to go over the side in the new parachutes. Now\na chute jump is nothing much; but when you haven\u2019t made one before, and\nhaven\u2019t even a man alongside you who has and knows something about the\nsensation and the harness, it is somewhat lacking in dullness.\n\nDelevan O\u2019Connell was swift to answer Jim Tyler\u2019s question. Already the\ndiscussion had gotten well within the bounds of plain speaking.\n\n\u201cIt makes this much difference,\u201d he snapped, keeping his eyes fixed on\nBurt, although he spoke to Jim. \u201cThe first jump must not be botched.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd therefore you must make it!\u201d exclaimed Burt Minster, with a great\nlaugh.\n\nDel O\u2019Connell flared up.\n\n\u201cI can not have this outfit broken up because this great oaf lacks a\nlittle nerve at the crucial moment.\u201d\n\nBurt Minster leaned backward in his chair to give his chest room for the\ndischarge of another roar of mirth.\n\n\u201cWhy, you poor insect, you, I\u2019m only about twice your size, but I\u2019ve three\ntimes your grit, at least.\u201d\n\nJim Tyler thumped Del O\u2019Connell on the back in time to halt the fiery\nlittle man\u2019s response.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t nerve but nerves that both of you have,\u201d he asserted\nemphatically. \u201cYou\u2019re both worried about those crashed ships, and you both\nwant to take the first risk, in consequence.\u201d\n\nThe truth does not belong in an argument. This theory of their conduct was\ndrowned in a combined shout of protest, but Del O\u2019Connell was a bit faster\non the tongue than Burt.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make that first jump; I\u2019ve got to!\u201d he cried, springing to his feet\nand thumping a quick fist on the parachute packs. \u201cYou can\u2019t trust this\nfellow, and if he bungles it, we\u2019re gone!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll not bungle it,\u201d retorted Burt Minster stubbornly. \u201cAnd as for nerve,\nI\u2019ve more nerve than he has language, which is some.\u201d\n\nJim Tyler slumped wearily against the side wall of the shack and waited\nfor the argument to subside.\n\n\u201cI stand ready to prove you a liar in any way you want to pick,\u201d Del\nO\u2019Connell declared heatedly.\n\nBurt Minster did not answer at once. His face reddened at the challenge,\nbut his eyes, as they dwelt upon the parachutes, were merely thoughtful.\nJim Tyler plunged into the lull.\n\n\u201cSince none of us has ever gone over, perhaps we\u2019d better rehearse a jump\nthis evening, before we try it on the crowd,\u201d he suggested, in the hope\nthat action would halt dissension.\n\nBut Burt Minster had by no means given up the controversy. He had merely\nbeen planning.\n\n\u201cThis Jenkins who is running the fair intimated to-day that he might raise\nthe ante if we pulled something particularly spectacular the first day,\u201d\nhe said slowly. \u201cAnd we need the money, if we\u2019re ever to get back where we\nstarted. Well, I have a scheme that\u2019ll settle this nerve question once and\nfor all, and give us a big lift toward buying another plane as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cOut with it, then,\u201d snapped Del O\u2019Connell. \u201cI\u2019m willin\u2019 already.\u201d\n\nBurt Minster laid a hand on the parachute packs.\n\n\u201cWe have two of them, and we planned that the jumper should wear both, as\nis customary. Well, instead of that, we\u2019ll both jump, you and I, at the\nsame time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what would that prove?\u201d snorted Del.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not through yet,\u201d Burt rebuked him. \u201cWe\u2019ll announce the thing as a\nrace to earth, the man landing first winning. You see, you don\u2019t have to\npull the rip-cord that opens the parachute the minute you leave the ship.\nYou can fall free--an army expert fell almost two thousand feet before he\nopened his \u2019chute--\u201d\n\nDel O\u2019Connell\u2019s eyes glinted.\n\n\u201c\u2019Tis not a bad idea at all,\u201d he admitted, and looked upon Burt Minster\nwith less rancor. \u201cI like it fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d interposed Jim Tyler. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ll both jump, and let\nyourselves fall a quarter of a mile or more? Why, that\u2019s the craziest--\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the man who pulls his rip-cord last wins, for he\u2019ll land first,\u201d Del\nO\u2019Connell explained. \u201cAs good a test of nerve as ever I heard of.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you can fly yourselves, then, for I\u2019ll not have a hand in it,\u201d Jim\nTyler announced firmly. \u201cIt isn\u2019t necessary for you two to kill yourselves\nto prove you\u2019re fools. I\u2019ll believe it now.\u201d\n\nHis statement made no impression on his partners. This was no sudden\nquarrel. Each, feeling guilty, was consequently touchy, and doggedly set\non doing his utmost to retrieve their misfortunes. And from this attitude\nit was only a short step, in the ragged state of their nerves, to an open\nconflict over the issue of courage--or any other issue about which they\ncould contend.\n\n\u201cWell, Jim,\u201d said Burt Minster at last, as Tyler continued to stand his\nground unswervingly, \u201cthere\u2019s another plane here at the fair, you know.\nThat fellow will take us both up if you won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nJim Tyler gave in at that, for he saw that his opposition to the plan was\nonly making them more eager to try it. Secretly he nursed the hope that\nnext day would bring them back to rational behavior.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut the opening hour of the fair found them still fixed in their resolve\nto carry on perhaps the strangest duel of nerve that had ever been\ndevised. The three partners kept apart, since talk only led to acrimony,\nand each at his post of observation watched the crowds gathering.\n\nThey came in battered tin automobiles, and they came on foot, and they\ncame in ancient horse-drawn vehicles, from Baychester County and from the\ncounty across the Baychester River which flowed past the Fair Grounds. Jim\nTyler\u2019s airworn but still airworthy Burgess training-plane was the center\nof a milling mob, for Baychester was not so sophisticated as some of its\nneighbors, and a flying machine was still an object of doubt and an object\nof awe. The ropes about it strained under the pressure of the curious, and\nthe voices of the guards who reinforced the ropes grew hoarse and\nquerulous. And word of the race to the ground through the thin air spread\nthrough the murmuring crowds.\n\nThe time of the flight came.\n\n\u201cNow boys, be sure and give us a good treat,\u201d Jenkins, a stout, harassed,\nbadge-encrusted gentleman instructed, as he bustled up to the shack\nwherein the partners had come together again.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get it,\u201d returned Burt Minster grimly.\n\n\u201cTwo of them,\u201d promised Del O\u2019Connell, buckling the harness of his \u2019chute\nabout him, and taking a final glance at the dangling rip-cord and the ring\nattached to it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make it worth your while,\u201d the official declared, and dashed away.\n\nAt the plane the three men waited, while space for a takeoff in the\ninfield was cleared of spectators. Jim Tyler warmed up his motor, and\nthen, throttling down, left the cockpit and confronted his partners.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re set on going through with this fool thing I suppose I\u2019ll have\nto stand by,\u201d he said briefly. \u201cWhere are you jumping from--wing or\ncockpit?\u201d\n\n\u201cSince we\u2019re not pulling the rip-cords at once we might as well jump from\nthe cockpit,\u201d said O\u2019Connell. \u201cYou can signal to us better from there and\nit will look more spectacular.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat suits me,\u201d replied Burt Minster curtly.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be able to get this bus up over six or seven thousand feet with\nthe weight of three men in her,\u201d Jim calculated. \u201cSuppose we make it five\nthousand, to be sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cA mile is plenty, since it\u2019s going to be a sprint,\u201d Del O\u2019Connell said,\nwith a chuckle. \u201cThough of course,\u201d he added, looking sideways at Minster,\n\u201cone of us may not do much sprinting.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeak for yourself,\u201d growled the other man. \u201cYou\u2019ll probably starve to\ndeath before you get to the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember, when I turn and put up five fingers, get ready,\u201d Tyler broke in\nhastily. \u201cAnd when I nod, jump! One from each side. And jump hard, so\nyou\u2019ll clear the tail.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d assented Del O\u2019Connell eagerly, and Burt Minster nodded\nagreement.\n\nThe infield was clear at last. With a final glance at the fastenings of\ntheir harness and the rip-cords that would release the parachutes, the two\nmen silently climbed into the rear cockpit. They wedged themselves into\nthe narrow seat. Then both turned automatically and studied the direction\nand force of the wind, as revealed by the whipping flags on the\ngrandstand.\n\nJim Tyler gave the ship the throttle. Bouncing and lurching, it charged\ninto the wind, the propeller flickering as it cut the air and flung it\nback upon the tense faces of pilot and \u2019chute jumpers. Far across the\ninfield the plane raced. Finally the wings took the burden from the\nrubber-tired wheels. The ship, with a final jolt, parted company with the\nground, hung poised above the grass, and began its upward climb.\n\nThough it was an old story to them, the two men in the rear cockpit looked\ndownward, each upon his side, and the plane climbed in great circles above\nthe fair ground below. The green of the countryside prevailed, but the\nbrown of the oval racetrack cut through it, and just outside this ellipse\nwas a speckled band of many indistinguishable colors that is the\nindication of people in masses. Beyond that, behind the cigar-box\ngrandstand, stretched a tightly packed section of black and gray-black,\nwhere the automobiles of the crowd were parked. Booths and buildings, gay\nwith bunting, displayed their tiny square outlines in regular patterns\naround the ground.\n\nAnd then, as the plane rose higher, the fair grounds contracted until they\nwere a mere detail of the landscape below--the great green and brown\nsquares and oblongs, with larger irregular patches of woodland,\ninterspersed here and there by tracts of well-watered pasture land, of a\nlush green. Across it all, as if dividing all the world into two parts,\nran the almost straight course of the Baychester river.\n\nDel O\u2019Connell and Burt Minster at just the same time turned their\nattention from the earth to the back of Jim Tyler\u2019s head. They were\napproaching their mark and both sensed it, although there was no altimeter\nin their compartment.\n\nThe motor labored on, and both men thrust feet out straight, and moved\nshoulders tentatively, as if to drive away any incipient stiffness that\nmight hinder action in that one swift leap into space. Both were entirely\nat home in the air, as seamen are at home on the water, but neither had\never gone out, deserting their craft for the impalpable element in which\nit swam.\n\nSuddenly Jim Tyler turned a grim face toward the rear cockpit and raised\nhis left hand, with fingers outstretched. Five thousand! For an instant\nlittle Del O\u2019Connell and big Burt Minster turned and looked at each other.\nDetermination was imprinted in the lines of both countenances, and\ntogether they squirmed to their feet in that cramped compartment, standing\nfull in the buffeting stream of air flung back by the whirling propeller.\nDel O\u2019Connell, with an agile twist, got one foot up on the rim of the\ncockpit and gripped the edge with both his hands. His head turned forward,\nand his eyes fixed themselves on the stern face of the pilot.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nBurt, a little slower, slung a foot over his side of the machine, and with\none hand fumbled for the ripcord and dangling ring at the end of it. Tyler\nnodded.\n\nDel O\u2019Connell, with a quick spring, brought his other foot up out of the\ncockpit and, clinging with his hands, crouched on the edge of the\nfuselage. His legs bent more sharply for the leap that would carry him far\nout into space.\n\nBut just then the eyes of Jim Tyler caught a sudden flash of white from\nthe pack on Del\u2019s back. The next instant the great silken parachute\nwhipped out of its confining envelop. Del\u2019s rip-cord had fouled on\nsomething inside the cockpit, and his eager jump to the rim had jerked it.\n\nThe great spread of cloth billowed open instantly and whisked backward in\nthe grip of the wind. For just an instant Del, entirely unconscious of\nwhat had occurred, held his place on the fuselage. Then, like a stone from\na catapult, he was whipped off his feet and flung toward the tail of the\nracing plane.\n\nThe open parachute swept into the tail assembly. The tremendous force of\nthe wind ripped it from skirt to vent as it caught. Shroud lines parted\nlike threads. Then the silken cloth wrapped itself about elevators, and\nseveral of the shrouds that did not snap became entangled over the point\nof the balance of the rudder.\n\nO\u2019Connell\u2019s whirling body struck the tail of the machine. Then it swept\npast, dropping out into space. But the remaining shroud lines were\nsecurely held by the rudder. O\u2019Connell\u2019s fall was checked by a\nbone-jarring jerk. His body dangled below the tail of the plane, swaying\nin the rush of the wind.\n\nThe plane wavered in the air, its flying speed dropping fast under the\nresistance of the silken cloth whipping backward from the tail assembly,\nand the drag of the man\u2019s body swinging behind. Jim Tyler opened the\nthrottle full, and thrust the stick forward for a steep glide. The\nelevators responded. They had been unhurt by the lashing parachute. The\nnose of the plane turned earthward; its speed increased.\n\nThe sudden catastrophe had come before Burt Minster had gone over the\nside. He drew back in the cockpit and stared over at the figure of Del\nO\u2019Connell, dragging behind the plane by the precarious strength of a few\nunsevered shroud lines. As he watched, he caught sight of the white face\nof his partner, and saw that O\u2019Connell, dazed by the suddenness of the\naccident and his whip-like snap from the cockpit, was just coming to a\nrealization of what had occurred.\n\nJim Tyler turned and stared backward, too, and then the eyes of Jim and\nBurt met. Speech was impossible in the fury of the motor\u2019s roar, but their\neyes appealed to each other for help--for some way out. The plane was\ndiving sharply earthward; to check that dive meant losing control of the\nship; not to check it meant to crash at terrific speed into the ground.\nThere was no way of getting O\u2019Connell back into the ship; that was utterly\nimpossible.\n\nThat communion of eyes lasted but a brief second; then both men turned\ndespairingly to the doomed man trailing behind the plunging plane. They,\ntoo, were doomed in that headlong dash, but somehow their plight seemed as\nnothing compared to his.\n\nO\u2019Connell had not lost his senses. They perceived that with both hands he\nwas fumbling, working at his right hip. Even as they watched, his hand\nwent to his left side in the same peculiar movement. Then they\ncomprehended.\n\nO\u2019Connell was unbuckling his harness. Already he had unclasped the snap\nbuckles that fastened the heavy webbing straps about his thighs; now but\none more buckle remained--the one across his chest. He did not look toward\nthe plane; his whole attention was absorbed in his task, exceedingly\ndifficult in that lashing wind, dangling there in space at the end of the\ncords. But in an instant he would no longer be dangling. The ship would be\nsaved--at a price.\n\nJim Tyler watched, paralyzed by the horrible fascination of the thing. In\nanother instant O\u2019Connell would have cast himself off from the plane--and\nfrom life. His dry throat framed at last an inarticulate sound of protest\nat the sight of that sacrifice. The wind swept it away unheard.\n\nBurt Minster, too, was watching. The breast buckle came apart. Del\nO\u2019Connell was free of the harness. He hung there by his hands, and his\nface turned briefly toward them. A strained, twisted grin was on it.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nA pain shot through Jim Tyler\u2019s shoulder; it was a blow from Burt\nMinster\u2019s heavy fist. The big man was squatting on top of the fuselage.\n\n\u201cRight turn!\u201d\n\nHis voice blared in the pilot\u2019s ear, audible even above the thunder of the\nmotor. Jim obeyed automatically. The plane swerved sharply to the right.\n\nAs the machine swung around, O\u2019Connell\u2019s body whipped sidewise, no longer\ndirectly behind and below the tail. In that instant Burt Minster leaped\nout into the air, all the strength of his powerful muscles concentrated in\nthe thrust of his legs. His body, its momentum aided by the rush of air,\nshot through space. He crashed like a plunging bull into the lean, small\nbody of Del O\u2019Connell.\n\nThe two men dropped together as the long arms of Burt wrapped themselves\nabout his partner.\n\nThe plane disappeared instantly from their view; they plunged downward in\na free drop, locked together, face to face. Air was all about them; the\nthunder of the machine died away in their ears. Beneath, the countryside\nwas slowly expanding, opening up before them like a magically blossoming\nflower.\n\n\u201cR-r-r-r-rip-cord!\u201d roared Burt Minster. His own arms tightened their\nclutch on Del O\u2019Connell until the little man\u2019s breath was squeezed out of\nhis chest. But even before Burt had spoken the quick right hand of Del was\nwriggling downward, between Burt\u2019s shoulder and his own, toward the\nrelease ring. He found it. He pulled.\n\nBurt Minster\u2019s breath followed Del O\u2019Connell\u2019s out of his body as an iron\nband tightened across his breast; his thighs were squeezed as if a boa had\nwrapped his constricting merciless folds about them. Del felt a repetition\nof that shock that had hurled him from the fuselage.\n\nBurt emitted a sound, half expiration, half grunt. His parachute had\nopened.\n\nIt spread above them like a shield. The country below ceased its eerie\nexpansion. Burt Minster\u2019s grip about Del O\u2019Connell\u2019s chest relaxed\nslightly, and the smaller man breathed again--deep, lung-distending\nmouthfuls of sweet air. There was no longer any rush of wind or roar of\nmotor; nothing but a gentle, lulling sway from side to side under that\ngreat canopy of silk.\n\nBurt Minster spoke first.\n\n\u201cThese things are supposed to handle up to four hundred pounds, so I guess\nwe\u2019re all right,\u201d he remarked, with an effort at a casual tone.\n\nDel blinked.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ll loosen up on those arms of yours, I\u2019ll be able to get a grip\nmyself,\u201d he answered. They adjusted their positions, and Del took some of\nhis weight from his hands by fastening his belt about Burt\u2019s harness. They\ncontinued to drift downward. The sudden cessation of hubbub and speed made\nthis gentle movement dreamlike.\n\nDel O\u2019Connell cleared his throat--and cleared it again. Finally he\nmuttered:\n\n\u201cThat stuff about nerve, Burt--I\u2019m a liar of the first water. Nerve?\nYou\u2019re nothing else.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw what you were doing, yourself,\u201d mumbled Burt Minster, equally\nshamefaced and uncomfortable. \u201cThat certainly took guts, Del.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to be out of that mess,\u201d said Del fervently. \u201cLook! Here comes\nJim!\u201d\n\nJim it was, and he was not above but below them. He was climbing fast, and\nit was plain to see that he had complete control of the ship. As they\ncraned their necks toward the ascending plane he banked sharply, and went\ncircling under them, waving his hand toward the tail. Nothing but a few\ntatters of silk and several shroud lines trailed from the control surfaces\nof the tail assembly. Jim had dived his encumbrance into ribbons.\n\nWith the plane whistling around them, they were wafted downward almost\ndirectly over the fair grounds. A gentle wind was drifting them toward it,\nfor Jim had calculated well before signaling for the jump. The earth was\ncoming upward now with greater speed, as their horizon drew in upon them.\nNo longer could they survey half the county.\n\nLegs dangling, they waited. Past the eastern end of the racetrack they\ndrifted, and then, suddenly, the ground thudded up against their feet, and\ndown they went in a heap together. The parachute slipped sideways, and lay\nbillowing on the ground.\n\n\u201cWe finished together, Del. It\u2019s a dead heat,\u201d said Burt Minster, climbing\nto his feet and lifting the smaller man with him.\n\n\u201cDead enough,\u201d answered Del O\u2019Connell emphatically. \u201cBut I\u2019ve a hunch this\nlast little stunt has broken our run of bad luck, Burt.
