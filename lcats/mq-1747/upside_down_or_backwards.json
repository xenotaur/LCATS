    "body": "\u201cWell, she ain\u2019t changed an awful lot since I left,\u201d remarks Magpie\nSimpkins, as he cuddles his long legs up under his chin and tilts his\nchair against the side of the cabin.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t expect no big changes in uh wilderness like this in thirty\ndays,\u201d says I, and he nods emphatic like and spits at uh lizard.\n\n\u201cThe East looks good, Ike,\u201d he proclaims.\n\n\u201cDid the East look good to you or did you look good to the East?\u201d I\nasks. \u201cSeems to me that you gets uh heap civilized in thirty days.\nWhat\u2019s the idea uh that hard hat?\u201d\n\n\u201cLast word in head-gear, Ike,\u201d he states, picking the yaller,\npot-shaped thing off the ground, and patting it affectionate like.\n\u201cThey calls \u2019em Darby hats. Did yuh notice that green and red shirt in\nmy valise? I annexes that in Chicago, Ill., U. S. A., and she sure is\nuh humdinger. Got uh necktie pin in that valise, too, that only\nassessed me ten dollars and eighty-five cents, and nobody what never\nseen uh real diamond could tell the difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing as ignorance is bliss around here yuh may make uh hit, Magpie,\u201d\nI replies. \u201cThe fact that yuh hangs your person full uh Christmas tree\nornaments don\u2019t lessen my hankering to hear yuh tell about how much\ncapital yuh got interested in the Silver Threads.\u201d\n\nMagpie Simpkins is Ike Harper\u2019s pardner, and I\u2019m Ike Harper. We owns\nthe Silver Threads mine, four burros, uh little grub and uh desire to\nfind somebody with money to promote us.\n\nMagpie\u2019s physique is impressing, unless yuh views him edgeways, when\nyuh can\u2019t get more\u2019n uh glimpse. He\u2019s six feet several inches tall,\nwears uh kind look and uh long mustache, and has the ability to let me\ninto more trouble than man is heir to.\n\nWhen we gets nine hundred dollars\u2019 worth uh gold out of our placer\nmine on Plenty Stone Crick, Magpie gets the promoting itch. He orates\nthat in the East is uh tribe uh philanthropists who spend their time\nhunting for uh shaft to sink their money in.\n\nAlso he opines that as uh hunter and finder uh this certain person he\ncan\u2019t be beat or even tied. I protests audibly and often that we ought\nto let gold enough alone, but when Magpie gets an idea like that it\u2019s\nall off until he\u2019s proved that my objections were well founded.\n\nTherefore and immediate he packs his valise\u2014or rather one he borrows\nfrom Buck Masterson, the saloon-keeper at Piperock, and pilgrims East.\n\nI holds down uh chair on the shady side of our cabin for thirty days,\nand tries to figure out how long it will take \u2019em to get Magpie\u2019s nine\nhundred away from him. He indicates in his departing words that his\nstay is indefinite and his destination problematical, but he comes\nback on the thirtieth day.\n\nHe pilgrims up from Piperock, with the taste uh ashes in his mouth, uh\nyaller, hard hat on his head and kid gloves on his hands. I hands him\nuh welcome and uh cigaret, and he humps up in my chair.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s uh hard drag, Ike,\u201d he states. \u201cThe tribe I mentioned is either\ngetting scarce or somebody has declared uh closed season on \u2019em. I\ninvades Pittsburg and Chicago and other places too numerous to\nmention, but all I could find was folks who were kind enough to listen\nwhile they took uh drink on me. When the drink was gone they all lost\ntheir hearing, Ike.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid yuh expect to find capitalists in grog shops?\u201d I asked, chiding\nlike. \u201cMoneyed men don\u2019t get drunk\u2014they gets intoxicated. Didn\u2019t yuh\ndo uh thing to be thankful for, Magpie?\u201d\n\nHe shakes his head, sad-like, and fumbles in his pocket. After\nsearching through all his clothes he comes back to the first pocket he\nlooks in, where it was all the time and he knowed it, and pulls out uh\nletter.\n\n\u201cIke, this is uh mystery,\u201d he proclaims. \u201cHonest to grandma, I don\u2019t\nknow what it means, but this letter says it was paid for and is on its\nway here. I didn\u2019t think I got so drunk that I bought anything except\nmore drinks, but\u2014well, take uh look at this.\u201d\n\nHe hands me the letter. At the top it proclaims to be from the Fur and\nFeathers Pet Shop, of Chicago. They orates that they handles each and\neverything what wears fur and feathers, and will supply same with\ncheer and great speed. The letter reads like this:\n\n    Dear Sir:\u2014\n\n    As per your request and purchase we are shipping you today\n    one cassowary. This is a male, and, in case you desires uh\n    female, we can secure you one inside of thirty days.\n    Thanking you for past and future favors, we begs to\n    remain\u2014and so forth.\n\nI hands the letter back to Magpie, and rolls uh smoke.\n\n\u201cThe letter was waiting for me when I got here,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize, Magpie. How much did yuh pay for this\nmale bird, beast or reptile?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I don\u2019t know, Ike. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always are, Magpie,\u201d says I. \u201cYou can be sorry more times, hand\nrunning, than any man I ever seen. You were born to sorrow. Some folks\nare born to sorrow, but some are like me\u2014they has sorrow forced upon\n\u2019em. What\u2019ll we do with the danged thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do I know?\u201d he snaps at me. \u201cCassowary! What in \u2014\u2014 is uh\ncassowary, Ike?\u201d\n\n\u201cI ought to know!\u201d I snaps right back at him. \u201cYou must uh been pretty\nblamed drunk, Magpie Simpkins.\u201d\n\nHe nods, solemn-like, and spits at uh lizard again.\n\n\u201cMaybe. That Eastern hooch is awful stuff, Ike. I don\u2019t remember no\npet store. I must uh bought it the night I left Chicago for St. Louis.\nI wakes up in the morning and went to uh ticket office.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me uh ticket to St. Louis,\u201d says I to the clerk.\n\n\u201cHe looks queer like at me, and calls in uh policeman, and Ike, I had\nuh \u2014\u2014 of uh time convincing that officer that I wasn\u2019t crazy. He\nexplained to me that I\u2019m already in St. Louis.\u201d\n\n\u201cThem policemen must be uh nearsighted bunch,\u201d says I. \u201cYou\u2019d have uh\nnice time trying to prove that to an officer west uh Dakota.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t chide me, Ike,\u201d says he. \u201cI was uh stranger in uh strange land,\nand they took me in. Anyway I got uh green and red shirt, uh civilized\nhat and uh necktie pin to show for my trip.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget Cassie,\u201d says I. \u201cDidn\u2019t you talk mines uh-tall?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh. There was uh fat bartender in Chicago who sympathized with me\nuh heap. Said he wished I\u2019d uh showed up sooner with my proposition,\ncause he\u2019d sunk all his money in uh new diving apparatus. He sure was\nuh good old scout, Ike. Doggone, that feller could fix up uh drink uh\nhooch until she tastes almost temperance, but she sure was uh sheep in\nwolf\u2019s clothes. I rode all the way from Chicago to St. Louis on three\nof \u2019em and didn\u2019t know it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe big question before the house is this, Magpie: is this here\npurchase uh yours uh singer, uh beast, uh burden or uh nuisance?\u201d\n\n\u201cMust be uh useful utensil, Ike, or I\u2019d never bought it. I may get\nred-eyed from wobble water but I never loses my sense uh useful and\nornamental things. I\u2019m what you\u2019d call uh discerning person\u2014drunk or\nsober.\u201d\n\nAll uh which shows that there ain\u2019t no use arguing with Magpie\nSimpkins. He can do no wrong. Uh course he might do things that he\u2019d\nbe sorry for, but he never figures that he\u2019s wrong\u2014just uh little\nmistaken for the time being.\n\n\u201cCome back broke?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cUh-huh. My gosh, Ike, I must uh spent money like uh timber Willie. If\nI knowed what that animile cost me I could figure how much the trip\ncost me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to let X equal the missing quantity, Magpie,\u201d says I.\n\u201cYou had nine hundred when yuh left, and you\u2019re broke now; therefore\nthe trip cost me four hundred and fifty. Sabe?\u201d\n\nMagpie don\u2019t sleep well that night. First he has an argument with that\nChicago bartender. Uh course, me being an innocent bystander or\nbylayer, I gets hit in the nose. I cautions him to fight the other\nway. He apologizes uh heap, but inside uh five minutes he starts\nanother fight with some colored person over the way his bed is made\nand I gets pitched out of the bunk and hits my head on the stove.\n\nI\u2019ve been mistook for an Injun, and one time \u201cRed River\u201d Radkey\nabsorbs too much of the fermented foam, and mistakes me for uh pink\npollywog, but that\u2019s the first time that anybody ever mistook me for\nuh colored porter, and it makes me mad.\n\nI climbs right back on that bunk, gets Magpie by the feet, and drags\nhim around the yard in the moonlight. He\u2019s plumb awake and docile\nenough to apologize again when I finishes the third lap around the\nwoodpile, so he climbs back on the bunk and I takes uh blanket and\nsleeps on the floor.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next morning we saddles our burros and starts for town. We\u2019re out\nuh spuds, and we needs some drill steel. Magpie leads the procession,\nsetting on the rump of uh fuzzy-looking jackass. He\u2019s wearing that\nhard hat, green and red shirt\u2014he sheds his vest\u2014and on his hands he\nwears them gray gloves. He sure is uh thing to see. Even the burros\nacts bashful around him.\n\n\u201cI reckon I\u2019ll make the inhabitants uh Piperock set up and take\nnotice,\u201d he states, admiring himself.\n\nHe sets the pot-shaped hat on the peak of his head, and brushes off\nthat loco shirt with his gloves.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d says I. \u201cAll I hope is that they don\u2019t set up with uh gun in\ntheir hands. You sure look like uh cross between uh lodge-pole\nChristmas tree and uh zebra.\u201d\n\nWe pilgrims down to the main road, and ambles through the dust in the\ndirection of Piperock. We comes to uh turn in the road, where we sees\nuh man setting alongside on uh rock. He\u2019s all humped up, with his head\nbetween his hands, and don\u2019t look up until I hails him. Then we\nrecognizes him as being Chuck Warner, puncher for the Cross-J. I never\ndid know just how to take that feller. He never growed none to speak\nof from his waist on down, and I figures that he\u2019s the\nhonestest-looking liar I ever met. He sets there on that rock,\nsad-like, but when he sizes up our outfit his eyes gets bigger and he\nsort uh gasps:\n\n\u201cMy \u2014\u2014! It must be true!\u201d\n\n\u201cToo true,\u201d I replies, glancing at Magpie. \u201cToo true.\u201d\n\nHe gets off the rock and wobbles over to us. His eyes are blood-shot,\nlike he\u2019d been dallying unduly with the cheerful fluid, and he squints\nat Magpie.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Magpie Simpkins in disguise, Chuck,\u201d says I.\n\n\u201cHuh,\u201d says he, sort uh relieved like. \u201cMaybe I ain\u2019t so bad as I\nthought. You fellers got time to help out uh pilgrim in doubt?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour obedient servants,\u201d says I. \u201cLead us to the doubt.\u201d\n\nHe turns and ambles off across the country, and me and Magpie is right\nbehind him. About two hundred yards from the road he stops and points\nacross an open spot.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my bronc,\u201d he states. \u201cYessir, that\u2019s my little hawse, but,\nbut\u2014say, what in \u2014\u2014 is on that rope uh mine, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cFluttering fool-hens!\u201d explodes Magpie, fanning himself with his\ncivilized hat.\n\nI looks and swallers uh chaw uh natural leaf.\n\n\u201cDo\u2014do you see it, too?\u201d asks Chuck.\n\n\u201cJust exactly,\u201d states Magpie. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it ain\u2019t the granddaddy uh all blue grouse I\u2019ll eat my hat,\u201d\norates Chuck. \u201cYuh see I been down to Piperock for three days, trying\nto bust Buck\u2019s wheel, and drink all the hooch in town. I comes along\nthe road this morning, singing merrily, when I happens to see that\nbusted crate in the road. I pulls up to see what it is, and my bronc\ndanged near dumps me off. He\u2019s scared at something in the brush, and\nwhen I spurs him over to see what it is, we scares out that blasted\nthing!\n\n\u201cNot being responsible for my actions I takes down my rope and\nproceeds to annex the thing. Between that thing and my bronc, they\nmakes life miserable for me, so I gets off and leaves \u2019em to their\nfate. The rope is wound around the bush between \u2019em so they can\u2019t do\nnothing but stand there and contemplate each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t reckon there\u2019s any doubt about it being uh grown bird,\u201d\nstates Magpie, fussing with uh cigaret.\n\n\u201cYour perceptions are wide open, Magpie,\u201d nods Chuck. \u201cWonder where it\nflew from. It ain\u2019t no grouse nor yet it don\u2019t partake of any of the\nrequirements of the fool-hen. It might uh been uh hummingbird about\nthe time this here world was started.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s sure uh hummer,\u201d I agrees. \u201cIf I\u2019d been born with uh neck like\nthat I\u2019d uh died from delirium tremens years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d opine that somebody done lost that crate off uh wagon, and maybe\nthere\u2019s something around to tell what and whose it is,\u201d says Magpie.\n\nWe all pilgrims back to the road, and Chuck leads us to the busted\nbunch uh slats. On one side it says\u2014\n\n                            DO NOT TEASE.\n\nOn the other side, in letters uh foot high, it says\u2014\n\n                    MAGPIE SIMPKINS\n                             PIPEROCK\n                                MONTANA\n\nWe reads it over several times, and then Magpie steps back, cocks his\nyaller hat over one eye, sticks his thumbs in his belt and snorts\u2014\n\n\u201cThat is Cassie!\u201d\n\n\u201cMake it Caspar,\u201d says I. \u201cIt\u2019s uh male cassowary, Magpie.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh!\u201d snorts Chuck. \u201cYou wise guys knowed all the time what it was,\ndidn\u2019t yuh? What yuh going to do with the thing? What in \u2014\u2014 is it\nanyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat thing, Chuck,\u201d says I, \u201cis what uh man buys in the East when\nhe\u2019s drunk up seven hundred dollars\u2019 worth uh mixed hooch. Cassowary\nis uh French word what means, \u2018something yuh bought when you\u2019re too\ndrunk to consider the expense and necessity.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI always did like the French language,\u201d states Chuck. \u201cIt sure is\nexpressive that-away, \u2019cause yuh don\u2019t have to say much to mean uh\nwhole lot. My mother was French. Name was Jones. Yuh pronounces it\n\u2018Hones,\u2019 the J being silent like the Q in cassowary.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says I, \u201cwe got to do something, and, being as it belongs to\nyou, Magpie, I reckon yuh better suggest.\u201d\n\nBut Magpie sucks away on that cigaret, and shakes his head.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d admire to hear all about it,\u201d states Chuck. \u201cThere must be uh\ndeep and dark mystery about that bird, Magpie. If I knowed the details\nabout that bird\u2019s past, maybe I could help yuh out.\u201d\n\nMagpie is willing to receive help\u2014as usual\u2014so he sets down there and\ntells Chuck all about it \u2014what he can remember.\n\n\u201cHow much do yuh think yuh paid for it?\u201d asks Chuck. \u201cYou sure ought\nto remember that part of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDang me if I know,\u201d replies Magpie. \u201cCouple uh hundred, most likely.\nWhat yuh got on your mind, Chuck?\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, what good is uh cassowary? If she was worth something to\nhumanity we might peddle the blasted thing. If folks had an idea it\nwas\u2014cripes!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the exciting thought, Chuck?\u201d I asks, but Chuck begins to roll\nuh fresh cigaret and grin to himself. Pretty soon he busts out\nlaughing and slaps his quirt across his chaps.\n\n\u201cBy cripes,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cIt won\u2019t cost nothing to try.\u201d\n\n\u201cTry what?\u201d asks Magpie.\n\n\u201cSay, if you gets your two hundred back will yuh give me all I can\nmake over that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou answered your own question, Chuck,\u201d declares Magpie. \u201cYou get us\ntwo hundred for that overgrown fool-hen and you can have the rest.\nWhat yuh going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my business, Magpie. You and Ike go along about your business,\nand don\u2019t peep\u2014no matter what happens. Sabe? Here comes the stage.\u201d\n\nArt Miller swings his four broncs around in front of us, and looks us\nover, sort uh grouchy like.\n\n\u201cHowdy, Art,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cWhat yuh doing these days\u2014distributing\npoultry?\u201d\n\nArt spits over his off-wheeler, and considers the busted crate.\n\n\u201cDid yuh see what comes in that there box?\u201d he asks, and we nods. \u201cDid\nye ever hear it crow?\u201d\n\nWe all shakes our heads, and Art puts his hat on the brake lever and\nfumbles for his tobacco.\n\n\u201cSounds like \u2014\u2014!\u201d he snorts. \u201cWe was going along, sleepy like, when it\ncrows. Runaway. Lost the crate out the wagon.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d agrees Magpie. \u201cCrate busted and canary flew.\u201d\n\n\u201cCanary!\u201d Art spits out the word like he\u2019d pulled uh slug from his old\npipe. \u201cMagpie Simpkins, you can get the dangdest things sent to you.\nWhat yuh going to use that thing for?\u201d\n\n\u201cArt,\u201d says Chuck, chiding like, \u201cyou neglected your duty as uh\nstage-driver when yuh let that piece uh valuable freight get away.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, go ahead and say it,\u201d replies Art, resigned like.\n\n\u201cCan you forget that you ever had that bird in your care?\u201d asks Chuck.\n\n\u201cAudibly or mentally, Chuck?\u201d asks Art.\n\n\u201cAudibly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope to some day.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe worth uh five spot, and no questions asked, Art.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never seen it,\u201d states Art. \u201cWhat\u2019s the idea?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou fellers are as inquisitive as an old maid,\u201d replies Chuck. \u201cAll I\nasks is silence, and plenty of that. I\u2019ll pay the bills.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re as silent as the tomb, eh, Magpie?\u201d says Art. \u201cYou ain\u2019t got\nnothing against me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing but admiration, Art. Chuck, do what you please with that\nhooch-hen, and we\u2019ll go on to town. I don\u2019t sabe your play, young\nfeller, but I\u2019m for it all the way from the ace to the deuce.\u201d\n\nWe got our stuff at Piperock, and pilgrims right back home. The crate\nand bird are gone when we returns.\n\n\u201cI wish I knowed what Chuck aims to do?\u201d says Magpie, as we goes past\nthe spot.\n\n\u201cAnd bust up our chances to get back that two hundred,\u201d says I. \u201cIf\nyou didn\u2019t hunger and thirst for information so hard, Magpie, I\u2019d be\nliving uh life uh ease right now. You always wants to monkey with the\nwheels uh progress.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbout five days later \u201cScenery\u201d Sims and \u201cDirty Shirt\u201d Jones pilgrims\nup our way and stops to eat. They asks the usual questions and gets\nanswered.\n\n\u201cMagpie, did yuh ever see uh railami?\u201d asks Dirty Shirt.\n\n\u201cUh-uh which?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh railami. Didn\u2019t yuh ever hear of one?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes. I used to raise \u2019em.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did not!\u201d squeaks Scenery \u201cThere\u2019s only one specimen left on\nearth today. Sabe?\u201d\n\n\u201cMeaning you, I reckon, Scenery,\u201d says I. \u201cYou\u2019re the only specimen I\never seen that might fit that cognomen.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not me!\u201d snaps Scenery. \u201cIf yuh don\u2019t know and recognize one when\nyuh see it, maybe you\u2019ll wish yuh did.\u201d\n\nThere ain\u2019t much left to say, except unpleasant things, so they says\n\u201cKlahowya\u201d and departs.\n\n\u201cRailami,\u201d says Magpie, after they\u2019re gone. \u201cNever heard the name\nbefore. The way Scenery pronounces it makes it sound like uh\nhare-lipped Piegan with hay fever trying to make uh noise like uh\nblowsnake.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be uh serious condition,\u201d I replies. \u201cIt sure can\u2019t amount\nto much if Scenery and Dirty Shirt knows what it is, so I ain\u2019t\nworrying about it none, Magpie.\u201d\n\nThe next day bringeth forth \u201cHalf Mile\u201d Smith and \u201cTellurium\u201d Woods.\nThey rides in and partakes of bacon and beans.\n\n\u201cWhat you fellers doing up this way?\u201d asks Magpie. \u201cSeems like me and\nIke is being honored lately. Scenery and Dirty Shirt was up to see us\nyesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrazy as bedbugs, too,\u201d says I. \u201cThey was looking for\u2014say, Magpie,\nwhat was that word?\u201d\n\n\u201cRailami.\u201d\n\nHalf Mile and Tellurium looks foolish like at each other and then back\nat us.\n\n\u201cYou know what it is?\u201d asks Tellurium, but me and Magpie has to plead\ntotal ignorance.\n\n\u201cYou looking for it, too, Tellurium?\u201d I asks.\n\nHe rubs the bald spot on top of his head, and grins.\n\n\u201cUh-huh. She\u2019s worth looking for.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hate to have to ask questions,\u201d I states.\n\n\u201cWorth uh thousand dollars,\u201d says Tellurium. \u201cUh cold thousand.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo is sixty ounces uh gold, too, but that don\u2019t tell nothing but the\nvalue,\u201d orates Magpie. \u201cSpeak up, you\u2019re among friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t,\u201d states Half Mile. \u201cNo use letting everybody in on it,\nTellurium. If they don\u2019t know about it we hadn\u2019t ought to lessen our\nchances by telling.\u201d\n\nWe thanks \u2019em heartily for the information, and they rides away.\nMagpie gets out his dictionary and ponders deep like over it, but\nshakes his head.\n\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t in the book, Ike. Must be uh foreign substance.\u201d\n\nThe next day comes old Judge Steele and Ricky Henderson. They salutes\nus, and gets off to rest their saddles.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s law and justice, Judge?\u201d asks Magpie. \u201cYou fellers hunting for\nuh railami?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh!\u201d snorts the judge, like he didn\u2019t hear, and glances at Ricky.\n\n\u201cRailami,\u201d repeats Magpie.\n\n\u201cWhy\u2014uh\u2014you seen any?\u201d asks the judge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve quit drinking, Judge,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019d uh seen one\nnext, and I tapers off just in time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d exclaims the judge. \u201cRicky, I reckon me and you had\nbetter be going on. We\u2019re looking for uh couple uh strays. Two red\ncows. Seen anything of \u2019em up here, Magpie?\u201d\n\nWe disclaims all credit for seeing two red cows, and they departs.\n\n\u201cSomebody\u2019s uh heap crazy around here, Ike,\u201d states Magpie. \u201cEither\nthey\u2019re crazy to look for uh thing with uh name like that, or we\u2019re\ncrazy for not looking. Let\u2019s me and you go over on Roaring Crick\ntomorrow and do uh little gophering on that quartz seam. Maybe we\u2019ll\nmeet uh railami on the trail, eh?\u201d\n\nMe and Magpie gets enthusiastic over the way that quartz seam shows\nup, and when we leaves there we\u2019re out uh grub. Magpie suggests that\nwe pilgrims to Piperock and get uh banquet uh ham and aigs, and I\u2019m\nright with him, so we points our burros toward town.\n\nMagpie is still wearing that yaller hard hat. The burro he\u2019s riding\nturns its head once in uh while and looks back. It sizes him up,\nshakes its ears, sad-like, and pilgrims on. Magpie sure is dressed up\nlike uh plush horse, and all he needs is uh cane to be uh cripple for\nlife.\n\nThere seems to be uh certain degree of excitement in Piperock, when we\narrives. Chuck Warner is setting on his bronc out there in the middle\nof the street, and he\u2019s surrounded with uh crowd. Lying down in the\ndusty road is that blasted bird that Magpie bought, and uh rope runs\nfrom Chuck\u2019s saddle to its long neck. The bird seems to be the coolest\nthing in town.\n\n\u201cWhat do yuh reckon to do with it, Chuck?\u201d asks Dirty Shirt, and\neverybody seems interested.\n\n\u201cDanged if I know,\u201d replies Chuck. \u201cI ain\u2019t never seen nothing like it\nbefore. It just comes busting along down the road, and I hangs my rope\non it. Wish I knowed what she is.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much do yuh want for it, Mister Warner?\u201d asks Judge Steele,\nlooking the critter over, and fumbling in his pocket.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want it, do yuh, Judge?\u201d laughs Masterson. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t\neat it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what she\u2019s worth, Judge,\u201d states Chuck. \u201cAin\u2019t she some\nwhopper of uh piece uh poultry? What do yuh reckon she\u2019s worth?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give yuh ten dollars for it,\u201d squeaks Scenery Sims. \u201cI\u2019d give uh\nten just to own uh thing like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe \u2014\u2014 yuh would!\u201d snorts Half Mile. \u201cI\u2019ll give fifteen.\u201d\n\n\u201cFifteen\u2014fifteen\u2014fifteen,\u201d chants Chuck. \u201cWho\u2019ll give twenty?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make it twenty,\u201d yells Ricky Henderson.\n\n\u201cPoultry\u2019s going up!\u201d whoops Chuck, standing up in his stirrups.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019ll give Ricky uh raise?\u201d\n\n\u201cI makes it worth thirty,\u201d states the judge.\n\n\u201cForty!\u201d yelps Tellurium.\n\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d whoops Chuck. \u201cWait uh minute. What\u2019s the idea uh getting all\nheated up over uh overgrown fool-hen on stilts. First thing we knows\nthere\u2019ll be sorrow in our city. I got uh good scheme. I\u2019ll make a\nhundred tickets at five dollars each, and raffle the blamed thing. You\nfellers can gamble your heads off if yuh feels inclined.\u201d\n\nThat seems to suit the crowd, so Chuck puts the bird in Buck\nMasterson\u2019s stable, and him and some of the rest gets busy on making\ntickets.\n\nMe and Magpie sets there on the sidewalk and wonders what them Jaspers\nwant of that bird. Art Miller comes over, but he don\u2019t know any more\nthan we do.\n\n\u201cHow comes it that everybody covets that monstrosity, Art?\u201d I asks,\nbut Art shakes his head, and digs his toes in the dirt.\n\n\u201cDanged if I know, Ike. I never seen folks so crazy before. I felt\nthat there\u2019s something in the wind for several days. Tellurium, Half\nMile, Scenery, Ricky, Dirty Shirt and Judge Steele has been in\nconference several times up in the judge\u2019s office. Here comes\nTellurium. Maybe he\u2019ll tell us what it means.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nTellurium sets down with us for uh minute, and then gets up and turns\naround three times, like uh losing gambler does to change his luck.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d admire to know what you wants that freak bird for, Tellurium?\u201d\nstates Art.\n\n\u201cYou would, eh?\u201d chuckles Tellurium, hauling some pieces uh paper out\nof his pocket, and putting \u2019em into another. \u201cYou would, eh? Don\u2019t you\nknow, Art?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t ask if I did.\u201d\n\nTellurium fusses around in his inside pocket, and hauls out uh piece\nuh writing paper.\n\n\u201cI reckon the tickets are all sold now, so it won\u2019t do no harm to let\nyuh know,\u201d says he, handing Art the paper. \u201cI done invested\nseventy-five on my luck, but I reckon you fellers are too late to even\nbuy one ticket. When I left Judge Steele and Half Mile was quarreling\nover who gets the last number. Read that letter and be sorry yuh\ndidn\u2019t buy no chances. We don\u2019t know who it was written to, but we\nfigures that it was some uh them citified prospectors what was through\nhere uh short time ago. We found it on the floor in Buck\u2019s place, and\nthat\u2019s what brought us up to your place that day, Ike.\u201d\n\nThe three of us groups there on the sidewalk and reads what is left of\nthat epistle. The top and one corner is torn off, but that is how she\nreads from that on down:\n\n    \u2014little information. Some geologist friends of mine were\n    down in that country last Summer, and they brought me the\n    track of a bird\u2014dried in alkali mud. The measurements and\n    peculiar arrangement of the toes show it to be the track\n    of a Railami, a bird that is believed to have been extinct\n    for many years. The imprint is of recent times\u2014not over\n    six months\u2014and without a doubt, in the vicinity of the\n    town of Piperock lives and roams a specimen of this rare\n    bird. It greatly resembles an ostrich in size and\n    characteristics, but as there are no ostriches in that\n    country, it would be difficult to mistake anything else\n    for this rare bird. I would be willing to give one\n    thousand dollars for this specimen alive, and will gladly\n    welcome any information you can send me. Very truly yours,\n\n                              C. Ewein Church, New York, N. Y.\n\n\u201cMy \u2014\u2014!\u201d snorts Magpie. \u201cHere we\u2019ve had uh thousand dollars running\nloose around here and didn\u2019t know it. Ain\u2019t that the limit?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust uh case of grasping an opportunity when she comes your way,\u201d\nchuckles Tellurium, looking at his tickets again. \u201cSome of us are wide\nawake around here.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d I agrees. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned I tries to get my regular\nsleep.\u201d\n\nTellurium pilgrims back across the street, and pretty soon we opines\nthat we might as well go and see what\u2019s doing, so we enters Buck\u2019s\nplace. Chuck leads the bird in, and ties it to uh leg of the\npool-table. The bird squats down on the floor, and Chuck mounts uh\nchair.\n\n\u201cGents,\u201d says he, yelling for order. \u201cWe are gathered together here to\nraffle off uh bird that nobody seems to know nothing about. I puts my\nrope on it and, being it don\u2019t show no brand, I claims it as mine. Am\nI right?\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to law, Chuck,\u201d admits the judge.\n\n\u201cBeing all things is so we will proceed to raffle off said bird.\nGents, will the first number out of the hat win the bird or will we\ndraw more before the lucky number comes to view?\u201d\n\n\u201cMake it three draws,\u201d squeaks Scenery. \u201cThird number out wins.\u201d\n\nThe bunch seems satisfied, so Chuck takes up the hat with the numbers\nin, and begins to shake \u2019em up.\n\n\u201cWho will do the drawing?\u201d asks the judge. \u201cWe got to have this all\naccording to law.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t, Judge,\u201d states Tellurium. \u201cYou got too many chances. Let\u2019s\nget somebody what ain\u2019t got no interest. Let Ike Harper do it.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t want to be mixed up in the thing uh-tall, but uh feller can\u2019t\nrefuse uh simple request like that, so I moves into position.\n\n\u201cLet her go, Ike,\u201d squeaks Scenery. \u201cIf you draws my number I\u2019ll make\nyou uh present of uh calf.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust uh minute!\u201d yells the judge. \u201cThat sounds to me like he was\ntrying to bribe or coerce the drawee. Scenery, you keep your mouth\nshut. I\u2019d be willing to make Mister Harper uh present of uh calf if he\ndrawed my number, but I ain\u2019t proclaiming it.\u201d\n\nI reaches up twice and tears up the two numbers that I draws.\n\n\u201cThis one tells the tale,\u201d says somebody, excited like, as I pulls it\nout and hands it to Chuck.\n\nHe unfolds it and squints hard at the number, turning it around and\naround.\n\n\u201cNumber\u2014uh\u2014say, Ike, what number is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cLooks like uh sixteen to me,\u201d says I, and Scenery whoops:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s mi-i-i-i-ine! I got sixte-e-e-e-e-en! Whooe-e-e-e-e!\u201d\n\n\u201cWait uh minute!\u201d howls Chuck. \u201cMaybe I was wrong, Ike, but take uh\nlook at it the other way. If that ain\u2019t uh nine\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s mine!\u201d whoops Dirty Shirt. \u201cDog-gone, I knowed\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLooks like ninety-one,\u201d says I.\n\n\u201cMy number! My number,\u201d whoops the judge. \u201cNinety-one wins!\u201d\n\nThe judge comes clawing his way to the front, and the whole crowd\nstarts milling around me.\n\n\u201cOuch!\u201d yelps Ricky, above the noise. \u201cLet loose! Wow! That danged\npelican bit me on the leg!\u201d\n\n\u201cI claims that bird,\u201d yells the judge. \u201cLead her out to me, Ricky.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike \u2014\u2014 he will!\u201d howls Scenery, climbing up on the bar, and shaking\nhis number under the judge\u2019s nose. \u201cJust because you misrepresents the\nlaw, Judge, it don\u2019t give yuh no rights to take property away from\nhonest men.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s live in peace and harmony,\u201d states Buck Masterson, sliding his\ndouble-barreled shotgun across the bar, and covering the crowd.\n\u201cEverybody shut up and listen to me! Look at the tickets in the hat\nand maybe yuh can settle this argument.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour wisdom is to be applauded, Buck,\u201d says Chuck. \u201cSheath that\ncemetery promoter, and we\u2019ll rest easier and think clearer. Ricky,\ngive me that hat with the tickets in.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your danged hat?\u201d asks Ricky, down on his hands and knees\nunder the table. \u201cIf it was down here\u2014let loose, you cross between uh\nShanghai rooster and uh giraffe! Huh!\u201d\n\nRicky\u2019s hand comes up over the table-top, and produces one square of\nwhite paper.\n\n\u201cYour hat\u2019s still here, Chuck, but that danged bird has ate up all the\ntickets except that number thirteen. I took that away from him\nand\u2014ouch! Yuh will, will yuh!\u201d\n\n\u201c_Biff! Coo-oo-orlook._\u201d\n\nRicky must uh kicked that bird for getting familiar, \u2019cause it comes\nright up into our midst with dangerous intent written on its\ncountenance.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nI love birds. Maw used to have uh canary, and I cried when it passed\nout. I got uh lot uh feathered friends, and I never met uh bird before\nthat even attempted to kick me. I don\u2019t think that thing was uh bird\nin the first place. I\u2019d call it uh cross between uh mean disposition\nand uh piledriver, \u2019cause it kicked Ike Harper, Esq., right where he\nwears his pancakes. Ike Harper immediate and soon skids across the\nfloor and plays uh billiard off Judge Steele and Buck Masterson, and\nfinishes up by holing out under uh chair.\n\nI peeks out from my ambush and observes that alleged bird leave that\nlow grog shop with Scenery hanging on to its neck and Dirty Shirt hold\nof its tail. Somebody must uh cut that rope. The rest of the audience,\nexcept me and Buck and the judge, follers in the rear.\n\nI must uh hit Buck and the judge pretty hard. Buck has got uh cut over\nhis eye where he bumped against the bar on his way down, and the judge\nfell between the bar and the rail, with his feet under the rail.\n\nI hauls the judge around so his back is against the bar, with the rail\nacross his lap, and folds his hands. Then I helps Buck into uh chair,\nwhere he sets and makes funny little noises.\n\n\u201cRailami,\u201d states the judge, without opening his eyes.\n\n\u201c_Z-z-z-zunkuff_,\u201d says I.\n\n\u201c_Uf-uf-uf-fuf_,\u201d says Buck.\n\nIt sure was an intelligible conversation. It was just about sensible\nenough for uh gathering like that and we all enjoyed it. Sudden like\nthe noise starts percolating down the street again, and I starts for\nthe door. I said I \u201cstarted,\u201d and that\u2019s as far as I got. Pete\nGonyer\u2019s pet coyote pup must uh wanted uh railami, too, and it wasn\u2019t\nbelow its dignity to come right into uh saloon to get it either.\n\nIn they comes, crowding each other for first place, and starts making\na three-ring circus out uh Buck\u2019s place. I\u2019d tell uh man that there\nwas something going on in there. That stilt-legged, overgrown fool-hen\nsure can cut circles, and that pup ain\u2019t no slouch either. All\noutdoors seems to beckon that bird, but he don\u2019t sabe mirrors. He cuts\nhis last lap about two feet in the lead of that pup, hops high, wide\nand handsome to the top of the bar and meets itself in Buck\u2019s\nbar-mirror.\n\nBounce? Say, that bird simply turns over in the air and comes back\nlike uh rubber ball. The coyote is yelping its fool head off, trying\nto climb the bar, when that mass uh feathers and legs hits him dead\ncenter on the rebound.\n\nScenery Sims is just staggering in the door when that pup opines he\ncan hear his maw calling him, and he tangles with poor little Scenery\non his way out. Scenery loses his feet, so, as long as he ain\u2019t got no\nvisible means of support, he sets down on the back of his neck, and\nthat demented thing that Magpie bought meets its original owner right\nin the doorway and they goes into the street together.\n\n\u201cSix-te-e-e-e-en!\u201d shrieks Scenery, clawing at his head, where it had\nbanged against uh chair-leg.\n\n\u201cNinety-one,\u201d croaks the judge, clawing at the bar-rail across his\nlap.\n\n\u201cPass,\u201d declared Buck, vacant like, and just then \u201cDoughgod\u201d Smith\nweaves in.\n\nHe looks us over, foolish like, squints hard at the judge, under the\nrail, and then shakes his head and starts for the door.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Dud-Dud-Doughgod?\u201d stutters Buck.\n\n\u201cDe-de-de-delirium tut-tut-tut-tremens,\u201d stutters Doughgod, right back\nat him.\n\nHe flops his arms, and sighs deep.\n\n\u201cNo use,\u201d he states. \u201cMust be uh lot uh lye in hooch that\u2019ll make uh\nfeller see things like that. It was standing down the road with its\nhead under uh hard hat\u2014uh yaller one!\u201d He shrieked the last sentence,\nand lopes out to his bronc, and away he goes.\n\n\u201cHead under uh hat!\u201d whoops Scenery.\n\n\u201cMy \u2014\u2014! Hid out like uh ostrich!\u201d And then he lopes out of the door.\n\n\u201cI got uh claim to settle, too,\u201d announces the judge.\n\nHe slides out from under that rail, hitches up his belt and gallops\nafter Scenery.\n\nMagpie ambles in the door, snorts the dust out of his nose, and Chuck\nWarner is right behind him. Chuck looks like he\u2019d been through a\nrevolution. He weaves over to the pool-table, gets down on his knees\nand searches the floor. He shakes his head, solemn-like, and searches\nhis pockets once more.\n\nPretty soon he gets back on his feet and wobbles up to the bar.\n\n\u201cBuck, you got any caster ile?\u201d he asks. \u201cI had all that raffle money\nin my pocket, and I reckon that danged cross between uh greyhound and\nuh duck must uh ate it up with them tickets. I can\u2019t find nothing but\nuh five-dollar bill in my pocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see the bill, Chuck,\u201d says Buck, and Chuck hands it to him.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d says Buck. \u201cIt ain\u2019t much but it will help to pay for that\nglass.\u201d\n\n\u201cDog-gone yuh, Buck!\u201d wails Chuck, leaning against the bar, \u201cthat bird\nain\u2019t mine. It lays between Scenery Sims and Judge Steele.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe \u2014\u2014 it does!\u201d squeaks Scenery from the doorway. \u201cThat bird is too\nactive to lay.\u201d\n\nHe walks over to Magpie, and slams that yaller hat down over his head\nuntil his ears stand out like sails.\n\n\u201cTake your danged pot hat, Magpie!\u201d he snaps. \u201cNobody ought to wear uh\nhat like that. Will some strong unwounded man go out and bring in the\njudge? He took that thousand-dollar bird, beast or reptile by the leg\nwhile I takes the hat off its head. I\u2019d uh carried him in but I ain\u2019t\nable to do much. I suppose I got to own that bird.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much about it, Scenery,\u201d advises Buck. \u201cIf the judge\nopines that his number wins you got to fight it out among yourselves.\nIf the judge don\u2019t survive I reckon he\u2019s got an heir some place to\ntake it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cAir \u2014\u2014!\u201d squeaks Scenery. \u201cHe was trying to get some when I left.\nThat thing can give uh mule high, low and the game and win.\u201d\n\nJust then in comes the judge, with Tellurium, Half Mile and Dirty\nShirt helping to support him. They sets him in uh chair and he droops\nlike uh wilted lily.\n\n\u201cHow do yuh feel, Judge?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cParalyzed from the belt-line both ways, Ike,\u201d says he, painful like.\n\u201cI don\u2019t reckon the shadder uh death is afar off. I sure have had\nparticular \u2014\u2014 kicked out uh me this day and date.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about your claim to that bird now, Judge?\u201d squeaks Scenery. \u201cI\u2019ll\nfight it\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGo to it,\u201d wheezes the judge. \u201cI\u2019ll pay half your funeral expenses. I\nhereby waives all claim to said monstrosity, and grieves to think I\never coveted such uh piece uh property.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it!\u201d whoops Scenery. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWith certain formalities, Scenery,\u201d states Tellurium, wise like,\nproducing uh piece uh paper and unfolding same. \u201cThis here\nproclamation was picked up this day in the street of Piperock, and\nunless I\u2019ve forgot all the botany I ever learned in school we been\nbidding on the wrong bird. You might pe-ruse it, Scenery.\u201d\n\nHe looks at me and Magpie, and hands the letter to Scenery. I leans\nclose enough to see that it\u2019s the letter that Magpie got announcing\nthe shipment from the Fur and Feathers Pet Shop. Scenery spells it\nout, with uh squeak after each word.\n\n\u201cCassowary,\u201d he snorts at Tellurium, and then he turns appealing like\nto Magpie: \u201cYou ain\u2019t going to send for another one are you? Honest,\nyuh ain\u2019t, are yuh, Magpie?\u201d\n\n\u201c_Ker-boom! Ker-bang!_\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe house shakes with the concussion and Buck drops uh glass he\u2019s been\npolishing for ten minutes. He looks under the bar, and gasps\u2014\n\n\u201cMy riot-gun!\u201d\n\nWe sets there and looks at each other for uh minute, and then the\njudge runs his fingers painful like through his hair, and orates in uh\npeevish, wailing tone\u2014\n\n\u201cWell, dang it all, send for uh doctor or uh coroner.\u201d\n\nSomebody starts to get both when the door flies open and in walks\nChuck. He ambles the length of the room and slams the shotgun down on\nthe bar.\n\n\u201c\u2014\u2014!\u201d he snorts, \u201cI shot its crop all to \u2014\u2014!\u201d\n\n\u201cIs\u2014is it dead?\u201d quavers the judge.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Judge,\u201d replies Chuck, weary like. \u201cIt was when I\nleft.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019d yuh shoot it for?\u201d asks Scenery.\n\n\u201cIt ate up all that raffle money\u2014dang its hide! Now, I shot the\ntreasury all to flinders.\u201d\n\n\u201cRaffle money!\u201d snorts Tellurium. \u201cDid anybody pay yuh cash, Chuck? I\nknow danged well I didn\u2019t. I just signed your paper for it.\u201d\n\nChuck looks blank like for uh minute, feels of his head, and snorts:\n\n\u201cCripes! I sure must uh been kicked hard. Where\u2019s Ricky?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight here,\u201d chirps Ricky. \u201cWhat yuh want?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s that piece uh paper I gave yuh just before the raffle\nstarted?\u201d\n\n\u201cPiece uh\u2014oh, that piece. Gosh! Was that worth anything, Chuck? I\nremember you handing it to me, and telling me to put it in my pocket,\nbut I thought yuh was joshing. Well, I was standing over there by that\nshotgun, after Buck puts it back on the bar, and unless I\u2019m mistaken I\nsort uh absent-minded like shoved it into the muzzle uh that gun. I\u2019m\nsorry\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d states Chuck, offhand like. \u201cIt looks to me like I\u2019d\nshot the business all to \u2014\u2014 with the profits. I lose eleven dollars\nand four cents on the deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I want to know is this: is that bird critter still in the land\nof the living?\u201d interrupts Scenery Sims.\n\n\u201cWhat I want to know is\u2014has somebody got some liniment?\u201d states the\njudge, and then me and Magpie and Chuck goes outside.\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t it awful?\u201d complains Chuck. \u201cThe goose that was going to lay\nthe golden aig is dead, and your two hundred is all shot to pieces.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust because uh sixteen upside down is ninety-one,\u201d agrees Magpie.\n\u201cHow do yuh figure you\u2019re out eleven dollars and four cents?\u201d\n\n\u201cI gave uh five spot to Art for holding his tongue, and Buck took uh\nfive for the busted looking-glass. Sabe? That\u2019s ten. The dollar I had\nto pay uh feller in Great Falls for writing that scientific letter,\none dollar, and it cost me postage both ways. She totals up to eleven\ndollars and four cents, Magpie.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, Chuck, where did yuh invent the name \u2018Railami\u2019 for that bird?\u201d\n\n\u201cSpell it backward, Ike,\u201d says he.\n\n\u201cYou are,\u201d states Magpie.",
