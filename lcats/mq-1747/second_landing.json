    "body": "By FLOYD WALLACE\n\n\n _A gentle fancy for the Christmas Season--an\n oft-told tale with a wistful twistful of Something\n that left the Earth with a wing and a prayer._\n\n\nEarth was so far away that it wasn't visible. Even the sun was only a\ntwinkle. But this vast distance did not mean that isolation could endure\nforever. Instruments within the ship intercepted radio broadcasts and,\nwithin the hour, early TV signals. Machines compiled dictionaries and\ngrammars and began translating the major languages. The history of the\nplanet was tabulated as facts became available.\n\nThe course of the ship changed slightly; it was not much out of the way\nto swing nearer Earth. For days the two within the ship listened and\nwatched with little comment. They had to decide soon.\n\n\"We've got to make or break,\" said the first alien.\n\n\"You know what I'm in favor of,\" said the second.\n\n\"I can guess,\" said Ethaniel, who had spoken first. \"The place is a\ncomplete mess. They've never done anything except fight each other--and\ninvent better weapons.\"\n\n\"It's not what they've done,\" said Bal, the second alien. \"It's what\nthey're going to do, with that big bomb.\"\n\n\"The more reason for stopping,\" said Ethaniel. \"The big bomb can destroy\nthem. Without our help they may do just that.\"\n\n\"I may remind you that in two months twenty-nine days we're due in\nWillafours,\" said Bal. \"Without looking at the charts I can tell you we\nstill have more than a hundred light-years to go.\"\n\n\"A week,\" said Ethaniel. \"We can spare a week and still get there on\ntime.\"\n\n\"A week?\" said Bal. \"To settle their problems? They've had two world\nwars in one generation and that the third and final one is coming up you\ncan't help feeling in everything they do.\"\n\n\"It won't take much,\" said Ethaniel. \"The wrong diplomatic move, or a\ntrigger-happy soldier could set it off. And it wouldn't have to be\ndeliberate. A meteor shower could pass over and their clumsy instruments\ncould interpret it as an all-out enemy attack.\"\n\n\"Too bad,\" said Bal. \"We'll just have to forget there ever was such a\nplanet as Earth.\"\n\n\"Could you? Forget so many people?\"\n\n\"I'm doing it,\" said Bal. \"Just give them a little time and they won't\nbe here to remind me that I have a conscience.\"\n\n\"My memory isn't convenient,\" said Ethaniel. \"I ask you to look at\nthem.\"\n\n\n\nBal rustled, flicking the screen intently. \"Very much like ourselves,\"\nhe said at last. \"A bit shorter perhaps, and most certainly incomplete.\nExcept for the one thing they lack, and that's quite odd, they seem\nexactly like us. Is that what you wanted me to say?\"\n\n\"It is. The fact that they are an incomplete version of ourselves\ntouches me. They actually seem defenseless, though I suppose they're\nnot.\"\n\n\"Tough,\" said Bal. \"Nothing we can do about it.\"\n\n\"There is. We can give them a week.\"\n\n\"In a week we can't negate their entire history. We can't begin to undo\nthe effect of the big bomb.\"\n\n\"You can't tell,\" said Ethaniel. \"We can look things over.\"\n\n\"And then what? How much authority do we have?\"\n\n\"Very little,\" conceded Ethaniel. \"Two minor officials on the way to\nWillafours--and we run directly into a problem no one knew existed.\"\n\n\"And when we get to Willafours we'll be busy. It will be a long time\nbefore anyone comes this way again.\"\n\n\"A very long time. There's nothing in this region of space our people\nwant,\" said Ethaniel. \"And how long can Earth last? Ten years? Even ten\nmonths? The tension is building by the hour.\"\n\n\"What can I say?\" said Bal. \"I suppose we can stop and look them over.\nWe're not committing ourselves by looking.\"\n\nThey went much closer to Earth, not intending to commit themselves. For\na day they circled the planet, avoiding radar detection, which for them\nwas not difficult, testing, and sampling. Finally Ethaniel looked up\nfrom the monitor screen. \"Any conclusions?\"\n\n\"What's there to think? It's worse than I imagined.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"Well, we knew they had the big bomb. Atmospheric analysis showed that\nas far away as we were.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"We also knew they could deliver the big bomb, presumably by some sort\nof aircraft.\"\n\n\"That was almost a certainty. They'd have no use for the big bomb\nwithout aircraft.\"\n\n\"What's worse is that I now find they also have missiles, range one\nthousand miles and upward. They either have or are near a primitive form\nof space travel.\"\n\n\"Bad,\" said Ethaniel. \"Sitting there, wondering when it's going to hit\nthem. Nervousness could set it off.\"\n\n\"It could, and the missiles make it worse,\" said Bal. \"What did you find\nout at your end?\"\n\n\"Nothing worthwhile. I was looking at the people while you were\ninvestigating their weapons.\"\n\n\"You must think something.\"\n\n\"I wish I knew what to think. There's so little time,\" Ethaniel said.\n\"Language isn't the difficulty. Our machines translate their languages\neasily and I've taken a cram course in two or three of them. But that's\nnot enough, looking at a few plays, listening to advertisements, music,\nand news bulletins. I should go down and live among them, read books,\ntalk to scholars, work with them, play.\"\n\n\"You could do that and you'd really get to know them. But that takes\ntime--and we don't have it.\"\n\n\"I realize that.\"\n\n\"A flat yes or no,\" said Bal.\n\n\"No. We can't help them,\" said Ethaniel. \"There is nothing we can do for\nthem--but we have to try.\"\n\n\"Sure, I knew it before we started,\" said Bal. \"It's happened before. We\ntake the trouble to find out what a people are like and when we can't\nhelp them we feel bad. It's going to be that way again.\" He rose and\nstretched. \"Well, give me an hour to think of some way of going at it.\"\n\n\n\nIt was longer than that before they met again. In the meantime the ship\nmoved much closer to Earth. They no longer needed instruments to see it.\nThe planet revolved outside the visionports. The southern plains were\ngreen, coursed with rivers; the oceans were blue; and much of the\nnorthern hemisphere was glistening white. Ragged clouds covered the\npole, and a dirty pall spread over the mid-regions of the north.\n\n\"I haven't thought of anything brilliant,\" said Ethaniel.\n\n\"Nor I,\" said Bal. \"We're going to have to go down there cold. And it\nwill be cold.\"\n\n\"Yes. It's their winter.\"\n\n\"I did have an idea,\" said Bal. \"What about going down as supernatural\nbeings?\"\n\n\"Hardly,\" said Ethaniel. \"A hundred years ago it might have worked.\nToday they have satellites. They are not primitives.\"\n\n\"I suppose you're right,\" said Bal. \"I did think we ought to take\nadvantage of our physical differences.\"\n\n\"If we could I'd be all for it. But these people are rough and\ndesperate. They wouldn't be fooled by anything that crude.\"\n\n\"Well, you're calling it,\" said Bal.\n\n\"All right,\" said Ethaniel. \"You take one side and I the other. We'll\ntell them bluntly what they'll have to do if they're going to survive,\nhow they can keep their planet in one piece so they can live on it.\"\n\n\"That'll go over big. Advice is always popular.\"\n\n\"Can't help it. That's all we have time for.\"\n\n\"Special instructions?\"\n\n\"None. We leave the ship here and go down in separate landing craft. You\ncan talk with me any time you want to through our communications, but\ndon't unless you have to.\"\n\n\"They can't intercept the beams we use.\"\n\n\"They can't, and even if they did they wouldn't know what to do with our\nlanguage. I want them to think that we don't _need_ to talk things\nover.\"\n\n\"I get it. Makes us seem better than we are. They think we know exactly\nwhat we're doing even though we don't.\"\n\n\"If we're lucky they'll think that.\"\n\n\n\nBal looked out of the port at the planet below. \"It's going to be cold\nwhere I'm going. You too. Sure we don't want to change our plans and\nland in the southern hemisphere? It's summer there.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not. The great powers are in the north. They are the ones we\nhave to reach to do the job.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but I was thinking of that holiday you mentioned. We'll be\nrunning straight into it. That won't help us any.\"\n\n\"I know, they don't like their holidays interrupted. It can't be helped.\nWe can't wait until it's over.\"\n\n\"I'm aware of that,\" said Bal. \"Fill me in on that holiday, anything I\nought to know. Probably religious in origin. That so?\"\n\n\"It was religious a long time ago,\" said Ethaniel. \"I didn't learn\nanything exact from radio and TV. Now it seems to be chiefly a time for\neating, office parties, and selling merchandise.\"\n\n\"I see. It has become a business holiday.\"\n\n\"That's a good description. I didn't get as much of it as I ought to\nhave. I was busy studying the people, and they're hard to pin down.\"\n\n\"I see. I was thinking there might be some way we could tie ourselves in\nwith this holiday. Make it work for us.\"\n\n\"If there is I haven't thought of it.\"\n\n\"You ought to know. You're running this one.\" Bal looked down at the\nplanet. Clouds were beginning to form at the twilight edge. \"I hate to\ngo down and leave the ship up here with no one in it.\"\n\n\"They can't touch it. No matter how they develop in the next hundred\nyears they still won't be able to get in or damage it in any way.\"\n\n\"It's myself I'm thinking about. Down there, alone.\"\n\n\"I'll be with you. On the other side of the Earth.\"\n\n\"That's not very close. I'd like it better if there were someone in the\nship to bring it down in a hurry if things get rough. They don't think\nmuch of each other. I don't imagine they'll like aliens any better.\"\n\n\"They may be unfriendly,\" Ethaniel acknowledged. Now he switched a\nmonitor screen until he looked at the slope of a mountain. It was\nsnowing and men were cutting small green trees in the snow. \"I've\nthought of a trick.\"\n\n\"If it saves my neck I'm for it.\"\n\n\"I don't guarantee anything,\" said Ethaniel. \"This is what I was\nthinking of: instead of hiding the ship against the sun where there's\nlittle chance it will be seen, we'll make sure that they do see it.\nLet's take it around to the night side of the planet and light it up.\"\n\n\"Say, pretty good,\" said Bal.\n\n\"They can't imagine that we'd light up an unmanned ship,\" said Ethaniel.\n\"Even if the thought should occur to them they'll have no way of\nchecking it. Also, they won't be eager to harm us with our ship shining\ndown on them.\"\n\n\"That's thinking,\" said Bal, moving to the controls. \"I'll move the ship\nover where they can see it best and then I'll light it up. I'll really\nlight it up.\"\n\n\"Don't spare power.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about that. They'll see it. Everybody on Earth will see\nit.\" Later, with the ship in position, glowing against the darkness of\nspace, pulsating with light, Bal said: \"You know, I feel better about\nthis. We may pull it off. Lighting the ship may be just the help we\nneed.\"\n\n\"It's not we who need help, but the people of Earth,\" said Ethaniel.\n\"See you in five days.\" With that he entered a small landing craft,\nwhich left a faintly luminescent trail as it plunged toward Earth. As\nsoon as it was safe to do so, Bal left in another craft, heading for the\nother side of the planet.\n\n\n\nAnd the spaceship circled Earth, unmanned, blazing and pulsing with\nlight. No star in the winter skies of the planet below could equal it in\nbrilliancy. Once a man-made satellite came near but it was dim and was\nlost sight of by the people below. During the day the ship was visible\nas a bright spot of light. At evening it seemed to burn through the\nsunset colors.\n\nAnd the ship circled on, bright, shining, seeming to be a little piece\nclipped from the center of a star and brought near Earth to illuminate\nit. Never, or seldom, had Earth seen anything like it.\n\nIn five days the two small landing craft that had left it arched up from\nEarth and joined the orbit of the large ship. The two small craft slid\ninside the large one and doors closed behind them. In a short time the\naliens met again.\n\n\"We did it,\" said Bal exultantly as he came in. \"I don't know how we did\nit and I thought we were going to fail but at the last minute they came\nthrough.\"\n\nEthaniel smiled. \"I'm tired,\" he said, rustling.\n\n\"Me too, but mostly I'm cold,\" said Bal, shivering. \"Snow. Nothing but\nsnow wherever I went. Miserable climate. And yet you had me go out\nwalking after that first day.\"\n\n\"From my own experience it seemed to be a good idea,\" said Ethaniel. \"If\nI went out walking one day I noticed that the next day the officials\nwere much more cooperative. If it worked for me I thought it might help\nyou.\"\n\n\"It did. I don't know why, but it did,\" said Bal. \"Anyway, this\nagreement they made isn't the best but I think it will keep them from\ndestroying themselves.\"\n\n\"It's as much as we can expect,\" said Ethaniel. \"They may have small\nwars after this, but never the big one. In fifty or a hundred years we\ncan come back and see how much they've learned.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure I want to,\" said Bal. \"Say, what's an angel?\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"When I went out walking people stopped to look. Some knelt in the snow\nand called me an angel.\"\n\n\"Something like that happened to me,\" said Ethaniel.\n\n\"I didn't get it but I didn't let it upset me,\" said Bal. \"I smiled at\nthem and went about my business.\" He shivered again. \"It was always\ncold. I walked out, but sometimes I flew back. I hope that was all\nright.\"\n\nIn the cabin Bal spread his great wings. Renaissance painters had never\nseen his like but knew exactly how he looked. In their paintings they\nhad pictured him innumerable times.\n\n\"I don't think it hurt us that you flew,\" said Ethaniel. \"I did so\nmyself occasionally.\"\n\n\"But you don't know what an angel is?\"\n\n\"No. I didn't have time to find out. Some creature of their folklore I\nsuppose. You know, except for our wings they're very much like\nourselves. Their legends are bound to resemble ours.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Bal. \"Anyway, peace on Earth.\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n",
