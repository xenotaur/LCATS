    "body": "To the beef round-up camp, now in the last stages of the hectic\ntrail, there arrived, seeking the 77 outfit as by tryst, a party of\nfour in a buckboard--driving in at noon, across the brown parched\nplains, timely to the cook\u2019s shrill yelp, \u201cCome an\u2019 get it!\u201d\n\nThey were, to wit: a stout ruddy man, a younger man, and two\ndazzling girls of garb femininely adapted to the Wild West. The\nequipage pulled down; lengthy Tex, the 77 foreman, rose from his\nseat upon his hams, to meet it.\n\nThe four piled out, the girls gazing open-eyed.\n\nThat which they saw was a conclave of ten hungry, hardy, red-faced\npunchers, reeking of the sun and saddle, squatted in various\npostures around the cook\u2019s Dutch ovens and earnestly stowing away\nthe midday chuck of coffee, beef, beans, stewed canned tomatoes, hot\nbread and sorghum.\n\nThat which the diners saw was two damsels fabulously appareled and\nglowing with innocent curiosity, the young sprig in dude rig of\nriding-breeches and natty flannel shirt and polished puttees, the\nelder man caparisoned to similar \u201csporting\u201d effect and manifesting\nan important strut, aggravated, perhaps, by the bondage of the\nflesh.\n\nIt was one world imposed upon another.\n\nHere, then, was the 77 owner, from the East, evidently to see how\nhis--_his_ cows and men were stacking up! Had brought his friends or\nfamily (\u201ctourists,\u201d in any guise) to the show; and first they were\nwatching the \u201canimals\u201d eat.\n\n\u201cOh, how romantic!\u201d breathed one of the damsels, lips parted.\n\n\u201cOh, hell!\u201d murmured man to man.\n\n                 *       *       *       *       *\n\nDignified as \u201cMr. Matthews\u201d by virtue of his office, Tex acted host.\nThe party seated themselves. The somewhat flustered cook, Tex\nassisting with the utensils, proceeded to serve from his cow-camp\nmenu.\n\nThe 77 stoically swigged and champed. At last--\n\n\u201cAll right, boys.\u201d Tex had spoken from his feet. The horse-herd was\nin, confined by its rope corral. With creaking of joints the men\nrose from their post-prandial cigarettes, to take down their ropes\nfrom their saddles and to stump on to snare their afternoon mounts.\n\n                 *       *       *       *       *\n\nNo joints protested more than those of Laramie,--\u201cLaramie Red,\u201d--who\nhad been riding a hard-bitted horse all the morning and was due, he\nknew, to fork Old Thunder this afternoon.\n\nThe horses of one\u2019s string, however, should be ridden turn about.\nConsequently Laramie flicked his noose for Old Thunder; and at the\nclap of the hemp around his neck, Old Thunder followed the trend of\nthe rope. A mild-in-appearance, fly-bitten roan, he, with a sleepy\neye--but with Roman nose and aggressive chocky head wherein obstinacy\nhad its dwelling-place.\n\nWith \u201cOh!\u2019s\u201d and \u201cAh!\u2019s\u201d and sundry \u201cBy George! See that!\u201d the\ntourist squad had taken station to observe the very simple\noperations of tossing a noose over a horse\u2019s head, yanking him\nforth, and investing him with bridle, blanket and saddle, and man.\nPerhaps there was romance in this, too. Kin savvy? If so, it had\nbeen imported for the occasion.\n\n\u201cWhat a pretty horse!\u201d\n\nLaramie was conscious of blue eyes in a fair flushed face devouring\nhis every motion--fascinated, maybe, by his flaming thatch, his\nlargely freckled visage impervious to wind and weather, and his\nbowed legs set by thirty years of chasing cows.\n\nBut \u201cPretty hawss!\u201d Old Thunder? Who\u2019d ha\u2019 thought it?\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d\n\n\u201cSatan, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d\n\nLaramie grimly continued with his routine. Old Thunder submitted, as\nif contemplating that period of coltship when he indeed might have\nbeen \u201cpretty.\u201d His retrospective mien portrayed docility.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a genuine cow-pony,\u201d pronounced the elderly man, who was\ndoing the critical. \u201cHardy, obedient, faithful, the cowboy\u2019s most\nvalued partner. The real cowboy never abuses his horse. Depends on\nhim too much. That\u2019s why he changes mounts whenever he can. Well,\npeople, you\u2019re seeing the actual thing--the Western cowboy at work,\noff the films. That\u2019s good. You know your business, my man.\u201d\n\nLaramie did not deign answer to that exalted address \u201cMy man.\u201d He\nsensed the sly anticipation of his fellows as he gathered the lines,\nturned stirrup to his foot, and with hand to cheek strap and hand to\nmane vaulted aboard in single movement.\n\n\u201cGo!\u201d somebody yapped.\n\nOld Thunder exploded. Always did. But this present play caught\nLaramie in a frame of mind more savage than usual. Was he to be\nbutchered for a tourist holiday? He gave the brute its head and\nraked with spurs relentless, to have the fit over with in short\norder. And ride he could, could Laramie Red, veteran of the range\ndating back to the long trails, to Abilene, Ogalalla and Miles City.\n\nCheers and cries attended upon him, inciting Old Thunder. His hat\nsailed free. After the preliminary cavorting, Thunder, true to his\nsystem, launched himself into furious straight-away out across the\nbrush, with Laramie sitting heavily until the fit should expend.\n\nAnd when he rocked in upon an Old Thunder, now satiated, to get his\nhat and to receive instructions for duty, he encountered a blast\nextraordinary.\n\n                 *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe elderly man, swelling like a turkey cock, advanced upon him.\n\n\u201cIs that your horse, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo sir; I wouldn\u2019t claim any such animal,\u201d retorted Laramie,\nruffled anew.\n\n\u201cRight. It happens to be my horse. You\u2019re fired.\u201d\n\nLaramie gasped.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re fired, my man.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. I\u2019m owner of these cattle and these horses. I\u2019m full owner of\nthe Seventy-seven. Understand? I employ cowboys, not busters. I\u2019ll\nhave nobody in my service who abuses animals. They tell me this\nhorse is perfectly gentle when he\u2019s been handled properly. I can see\nthat for myself. You\u2019re ruining him. No doubt you meant to show off\na little, but that doesn\u2019t go with me. Give your time to the\nforeman, and he\u2019ll pay you to date. If you intend to be a cowboy, I\nhope this will be a lesson to you. Br-rumph! No words, now.\u201d The\noracular dignitary had finished.\n\nBut Laramie could muster no words of utterance before ladies. There\nthey were, those two, standing aloof and eying him with look that\nscorched. And--\u201cIf you intend to be a cowboy,\u201d the stout gent had\nsaid. \u201cIf you _intend_ to be a _cowboy_!\u201d Suffering cats! He,\nLaramie Red, intend \u201cto be\u201d a cowboy! And--\u201cThey tell me this horse\nis perfectly gentle when he\u2019s been handled properly!\u201d So he was. The\ndeviltry having been ridden out of him, he\u2019d be as meek as Moses; as\nwitness now--a staid old fool!\n\nFired! That verbal mandate waited upon no further repetition.\nLaramie swung from the astonished Thunder and commenced rapidly to\nunsaddle. Tex, who had been busied elsewhere, came hurrying with\ngait interrogative.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Laramie?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothin\u2019 the matter with me. I\u2019m turnin\u2019 in this hawss,\u201d\ngrowled Laramie, engaged.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the hawss, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothin\u2019. He\u2019s plump gentle--a putty little hawss. But I\u2019m quittin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou! No! Why\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cBeen fired, aint I? No man need tell me that more\u2019n once.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho told you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYore big boss over yonder.\u201d Laramie indicated with jerk of red\nhead.\n\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d\n\n                 *       *       *       *       *\n\nLaramie smiled sourly through the perspiration of his rugged\ncountenance.\n\n\u201c\u2019Cause I abuse his pet stock. Got to learn how to handle hawsses,\nyet.\u201d\n\n\u201cHold on! You say he fired you?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe shorely did. I\u2019m quittin\u2019. Here\u2019s his hawss. You got my time?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Tex implored. \u201cWait! Why, doggone his skin--\u201d He wheeled about,\nbut the \u201cbig boss\u201d was valiantly coming as if to impress the stamp\nof authority. And the lingering riders grinned.\n\n\u201cThis man says you\u2019ve discharged him, Mr. Bunyan,\u201d Tex accused.\n\n\u201cSo I have. On the spot, too. Look at that horse. The man\u2019s a\nbrute.\u201d\n\n\u201cEasy, now, Mister,\u201d Laramie warned, a glint in his hazel eyes.\n\n\u201cShore, I see the hawss. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the hawss,\u201d Tex\nwould placate, somewhat bewildered. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll say the man you\u2019re\nspeaking of is a top hand--there\u2019s not a better man in the outfit.\nYou can\u2019t fire _him_.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t I?\u201d The owner of the 77 repeated. \u201cLook at that horse. In a\nlather already! See how he\u2019s marked up. The man\u2019s a--hum!--he\u2019s too\nrough. I\u2019ll not have my horses foundered, or their tempers ruined.\nLet the man learn to handle horses; then if he wishes to come back.\nI\u2019ll consider him. How much do we owe him?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut great Scott, Mr. Bunyan!\u201d Tex writhed with honest anguish. \u201cThe\nhawss aint hurt. His hair\u2019s scurcely mussed. You can\u2019t set a man\nafoot for that! A hawss has got to be _ridden_, else he aint any\ngood in the herd. I wouldn\u2019t waste time with a plumb mean\nhawss--haven\u2019t much use for a buster, anyhow. And if I caught a man\nmistreating an animal regardless, I\u2019d be the fust to fire him. Old\nThunder aint been mistreated. He\u2019s just nacherly a trifle gay when\nhe\u2019s fust forked. He does it a-purpose; he _expects_ to be tapered\noff like Laramie tapered him--wants somebody to come right back at\nhim, and then he\u2019s peaceful. That hawss is ready to go all the rest\nthe day. He\u2019s only one o\u2019 them kind that\u2019s got to be uncorked. Why,\nLaramie wouldn\u2019t choose to hurt a hawss or ary other animal. But on\nthe range a man has to ride and to rope and to brand; that\u2019s what\nyou pay him for, aint it? Laramie\u2019s a cow-man--been at it twenty-five\nor thirty year. He knows the value of hawsses and cows as well as I\ndo. You can\u2019t fire him for nothing.\u201d\n\nMr. Bunyan pursed his lips and gave judicial answer.\n\n\u201cI still think he should be discharged. But perhaps he was only\nshowing off before the ladies. He\u2019s a ladies\u2019 man! Anyway, he\u2019d\nbetter stay until you\u2019ve shipped the cattle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had, had I?\u201d Laramie snorted. \u201cThanks. Wouldn\u2019t care for some.\nI\u2019ll leave my saddle in the wagon, Matthews, and hoof to town. I\u2019ll\ngo to cookin\u2019 before I\u2019ll ever lay hand on another Seventy-seven\nhawss.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Laramie!\u201d Tex pleaded. \u201cStay and we\u2019ll talk this over. I need\nyou. You _got_ to stay.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m full up on talk, and I\u2019m full up on punchin\u2019, too,\u201d replied\nLaramie. \u201cFor the information of this loco, I\u2019ll say I was goin\u2019 to\nquit anyhow. Decided that yesterday. He\u2019s late. But I\u2019ll finish out\non yore account, Tex; then I\u2019m done.\u201d\n\n\u201cOho!\u201d chuckled the aggravating Bunyan, out of wisdom excessive.\n\u201cPay-day; then wine, woman and song, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Cordin\u2019 to yore tell,\u201d growled Laramie. He resaddled Old Thunder,\nbrusquely mounted, and without instructions rode off on duty\nself-assigned.\n\n                 *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe virtuous Mr. Bunyan returned to his party.\n\n\u201cDid you discharge him, uncle?\u201d one of the girls asked breathlessly.\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t he go?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll stay till after the round-up. Was rather saucy about it. Said\nhe was going to quit anyhow. The sooner he quits, the better.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndependent, aye?\u201d the younger man queried.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s easy come, easy go, with these cowboys. He\u2019s probably\nsaved his wages. No way to spend \u2019em, you see. So at first\nopportunity he\u2019ll lay off and blow \u2019em all in. That\u2019s it. Then he\u2019ll\nbe hunting another job. The same old story. I don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\nLaramie rode on, for a distance, alone. Thud of hoofs sounded. Happy\nJack drew in to pace him and be his partner for the afternoon\u2019s last\ncircle.\n\n\u201cSay, Laramie, you aren\u2019t goin\u2019 to quit, are you?\u201d Happy blurted.\n\u201cSure not. Everybody knows you\u2019re all right.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou bet I quit.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you aint fired. Tex does the firing in this outfit, and you can\nstay till your feet drop off.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I fire myself. \u2018Brute\u2019 and \u2018ladies\u2019 man,\u2019 am I? I know when I\ngot enough, and I\u2019m plump sick o\u2019 ridin\u2019. There\u2019s no thanks to it.\nThere\u2019s nothin\u2019 to show but saddle-corns and rheumatics and a bad\nreputation. What\u2019s a puncher, outside o\u2019 story papers? Yep, I\u2019ve\nmade up my mind. I\u2019ll quit at the shippin\u2019-pens, when I aint needed.\nI aim to sell my saddle and straighten out my legs, and never ride\nno more. Mebbe I can live on my income,\u201d he dourly added.\n\n\u201cAw, Laramie!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said it. If you\u2019re goin\u2019 to talk, you can talk about the\nweather.\u201d\n\n                 *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis evening the 77 camped by themselves, for the outland guests had\nleft. After supper Laramie waddled over to sit beside Tex and put an\nimportant question.\n\n\u201cHow much\u2019ll I have comin\u2019 to me, Tex, when you pay off?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the shippin\u2019-pens. We draw our money when we strike town at the\nend of the drive, don\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\u201cShorely. You needn\u2019t worry about that. You\u2019ll get your share,\nunless you want me to hold back.\u201d\n\n\u201cNope: no holding back this time,\u201d said Laramie. \u201cHow much\u2019ll it be,\nTex? You can figger, can\u2019t you? I aint kept track.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want to know for?\u201d Tex demanded. \u201cCan\u2019t you wait?\nThere\u2019s no way to spend it here. You\u2019ll spend it fast enough when\nyou do get it. Why don\u2019t you let it grow?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Laramie, \u201cI\u2019m curious. It\u2019s mine, aint it? Then I get\nit, don\u2019t I? How much?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what\u2019ll you do with it? Throw it away?\u201d Tex reproved. \u201cFive\ndollars will give you a good time in that shipping burg; the rest\nwont harm you if I keep it for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t stop in that burg,\u201d announced Laramie. \u201cI told you I\u2019m\nquittin\u2019. I\u2019ll need all my money.\u201d\n\nTex deplored:\n\n\u201cOh, pshaw, Laramie! I was hoping you\u2019d got that out of your system.\nThe old man\u2019s gone. \u2019Twasn\u2019t only a flash in the pan. I mean for you\nto stay on. Blamed if I\u2019ll let you leave the Seventy-seven.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t help yoreself, Tex,\u201d said Laramie. \u201cI been thinkin\u2019 of\nquittin\u2019, two-three weeks now, and I do quit, soon as we reach the\npens. You\u2019ll have men enough there.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoing to join another outfit?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope. When I quit, I quit ridin\u2019, and I pull out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy--what do you aim to do? You\u2019re talking foolish!\u201d Tex censured.\n\n\u201cMe?\u201d said Laramie. \u201cWell, I reckon I\u2019ll go to little old K. C. I\naint been in a city since--gosh, I don\u2019t know when, Tex. It\u2019s time I\nwas learnin\u2019 something.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou might have gone,\u201d Tex snapped. \u201cYou\u2019ve been started--I\u2019ve\nstarted you, myself; but \u2019fore you got to the train, where were you?\nPlumb flat. But all right: I\u2019ll send you in with the stock. Give you\nanother chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir!\u201d said Laramie. \u201cI don\u2019t go as any stock-tender, Tex. I go\ncivilized. I know I\u2019ve fell by the way, on several occasions, Tex,\nbut this time will be different. There don\u2019t nary man call me a\nbrute ag\u2019in. I quit the range, and I live white. When I get to\nKansas City, I\u2019m goin\u2019 to the swellest cafe in that town, and I\norder me the best feed on the hull mee-noo, regardless. I been\nlivin\u2019 so long on beef, I moo whenever I see a calf. I reckon I\u2019ll\nput up at the best _ho_-tel, and I\u2019ll take in the best thee-ater,\nand I\u2019ll buy some store clothes. Wow! Hey?\u201d And Laramie fairly\nlicked his chops.\n\n\u201cShorely,\u201d agreed Tex in tone caustic. \u201cI see yuh. Easy come, easy\ngo. You fellows are alluz fools with your money. All right; what\u2019ll\nyou do then?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Laramie, \u201clackin\u2019 better while I was lookin\u2019 round, I\nsuppose I might get a job at the stockyards. I know cattle. But that\nwont be ridin\u2019. It\u2019ll be loafin\u2019. Now,\u201d he concluded, \u201cyou\nunderstand why I figger ahead on what\u2019s comin\u2019 to me. How much?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good,\u201d Tex rapped. \u201cSeeing you\u2019re bound to know, I\u2019ll give it\nto you straight. Close as I can calkilate, Laramie, at the pens\nyou\u2019ll have exactly thirty-three dollars and fifty cents due you.\nWant, cash or a gold bond?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you sayin\u2019, Tex?\u201d Laramie gasped. \u201cI got more than that!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t. You remember, Laramie, that last time you turned\nloose, after the calf round-up, you lost all your money, and your\nsaddle, and bridle, and boots, and your four-gallon Texas hat, in a\ntin-horn poker-game. So I had to stake you to a new outfit. Those\nthings cost. And you\u2019ve been drawing a dollar or two, now and again,\nsince. I can show you in black and white.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t, Tex. Yore word\u2019s good.\u201d But thirty-three dollars and\nfifty cents, after thirty years of dogging cows from the border to\nMontana! Shucks!\n\nLaramie rallied. He had faced worse crises.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it, anyhow,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cI aint clean busted.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Tex. And he added with significant disapproval: \u201cNot yet!\nBut if you come back with your fifty cents, you\u2019ll be doing well.\u201d\n\n                 *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo Laramie Red was quitting! Considerable more remained to be said\nupon the subject, chiefly among his mates. And the chantey welled\nwith drawl of chorus his-way directed:\n\n    After the round-up\u2019s over,\n    After the shipping\u2019s done,\n    I\u2019m going ho-ome, boys,\n    Never more to roam.\n\nCapped by the remindful--\n\n    Gimme a platter o\u2019 Lillian Russell,*\n    Gimme a look at a skirt and a bustle,\n    Then take my money and watch me hustle\n    Back to the sage and sun!\n\n[* Peaches and cream, of course!]\n\n\u201cLaramie wont get past the first stop with a \u2018Last Chance\u2019 sign over\na door,\u201d they laughed. \u201cWhat\u2019ll you bet, Laramie?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that\u2019s regulation with you-all,\u201d Laramie answered soberly.\n\u201cNope, I don\u2019t bet. Can\u2019t afford to, after only thirty year workin\u2019\nfor grub. But you needn\u2019t lay any plate for me. When I ride, I ride\nin the cars. And, while you or\u2019nary brute punchers are still ruinin\u2019\nhawsses, I\u2019ll be eatin\u2019 off French mee-noos and sleepin\u2019 in a real\nbed. Anybody who thinks I don\u2019t mean it had better make me an offer\non my saddle. I\u2019ve fired myself, and I\u2019m done.\u201d\n\n                 *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201cTrue to his promise, several days later Laramie found himself at\nthe railway station of the shipping town--a wayside town bared upon\nthe bare plains, drenched with sun and dust--a spasmodic little town\nlivened at intervals, as now, by the beef herds bawling in the pens\nand shutes, and by the brown, rollicking riders turned loose from\nthe durance of the trail for their brief fling.\n\nEasy come, easy go, this, where (in the language of the country)\n\u201cthe coyote howls and the poker-chips rattle and money rolls\nup-hill!\u201d Wow! A rebound to riotous living, even to the extent of\ncanned peaches and canned cream; then--\u201cback to the sage and sun.\u201d\nTherefore, the session being limited and sentiment for a \u201cplumb\nidjit\u201d scant, Laramie, having rigorously declined invitations to a\nfarewell that might have cut his travels short again, was alone at\nthe station. Behind him the revels beckoned. He licked his lips\nthirstily.\n\nHe had shed his chaps; he had consigned his saddle and bridle and\nbed-roll also to Tex, for disposal. Somebody would buy them--and pay\nout of future earnings. But he was free, and he had his ticket, and\nmoney besides--hard money for that feed, and a thee-ater, and a \u201ctop\u201d\nbed with sheets and pillers; reckoned he\u2019d have to get a nightshirt!\n\nThe long train thundered in. And he (a figure _sui generis_, in his\nhigh-heeled boots and his big hat and his stained checkered blouse\nand his dusty trousers shaped to irrevocably bowed legs) was\nstumping down the line, when he brought up against another figure,\njust mounting the steps of a Pullman.\n\nThis was his critic, name of Bunyan.\n\n\u201cHello, my man.\u201d Mr. Bunyan paused \u201cStock-tender, eh? Did you decide\nto stay on for another try?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo sir,\u201d said Laramie, holding himself in stern check. \u201cIt happens\nyore stock-tenders don\u2019t travel on passenger cars. They travel\ncaboose, if they\u2019re lucky. Besides, yore cows are old enough to\ntravel alone, and so am I. I\u2019ve quit; I\u2019ve drawed my pay and I\u2019m\nheadin\u2019 for Kansas City, never more to roam.\u201d\n\nMr. Bunyan smiled with smile exasperating.\n\n\u201cYou are, are you? Hunting a job there?\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose I\u2019ll have to earn my keep, after I\u2019ve been fed up and to\na thee-ater. Reckon I\u2019ll enjoy life a little, fust.\u201d\n\nMr. Bunyan laughed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it! Easy come, easy go! Can\u2019t spend your money fast enough\nin this town, eh? Those other boys don\u2019t seem to have any\ndifficulty, judging by what I\u2019ve seen and heard. You men are all of\nthe same stamp. You lack good sense. What you earn in one month, you\nguzzle and gamble away in half an hour. I suppose that\u2019s being a\ncowboy!\u201d\n\nLaramie recognized that in this ironical diatribe there might be a\ngrain of truth.\n\n\u201cAs for \u2018easy come,\u2019 I dunno,\u201d said he, out of memories of the\nthirty years\u2019 wind and weather, round-up and trail. \u201cBut I\u2019ve\nree-formed. If I hadn\u2019t, I\u2019d take no such talk from _you_.\u201d\n\nWith that, for fear he might tarnish his new shield at once, he\nwaddled on, red and resolute.\n\n                 *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe discovered a seat in the chair-car; and having sat right there\nand slept right there so as to hold it and himself down, he arrived\nin the morning at Kansas City. He stumbled out upon the platform of\nthis union station that clanged and buzzed, pent with energy.\n\nNow the vague city, meshing him about, lured his farther incursion.\nSomewhere there was the swell cafe, and the pulsing life, and the\nthee-ater, and the bed with sheets, and the nightshirt and the store\nclothes. And somewhere, he fully comprehended, there were seductive\nbars, welcoming such as he--a man off the range, with his pockets\nlined.\n\nPeople casually viewed him as he stood. They could not mistake him:\nthe typical cow-man, veteran showing in every wrinkle of face and\ngarb: a red-headed, sorrel-visaged, puzzled migrant from the land of\nchaps and saddle.\n\nAs he stood blinking, those \u201cbrute\u201d instincts surged within him\nagain. Powerful thirsty he was--it had been a long time. Hungry, too!\nHis money burned in his jeans. It clamored for air and action. His\nfeet twitched.\n\n\u201cGee gosh!\u201d quoth Laramie, scratching his thatch. \u201cI got to do\nsomething. Mebbe I\u2019d better eat a snack just to ca\u2019m me down. \u2019Twont\nmake no difference when I find the genuyine lay-out. It\u2019ll give me\nstrength to look careful, for the best\u2019ll be none too good for me.\u201d\n\nHe wandered amid reverberant gates and corridors, and boiling\ncrowds, and his nose and ears led him to the dining counter--to the\nwarm aroma of food and the clatter of laden dishes. He sat upon a\nstool, awkwardly forking it with his crooked legs and his tipsy\nboots, and he shoved his hat back and squared before the menu. Over\nthis he pondered, running it through with gnarled forefinger.\n\n                 *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe titles mocked him. He seemed likely to starve in the midst of a\nstrange plenty.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll it be?\u201d the waitress chided.\n\n\u201cOh, shucks!\u201d Laramie murmured. \u201cI\u2019m an orphan on this range, miss,\u201d\nhe apologized. In his desperation he could think of but one sure\nbet. \u201cFetch me a platter o\u2019 beef,\u201d blurted Laramie.\n\n\u201cSteak or roast?\u201d\n\n\u201cMake her steak,\u201d bade Laramie, still playing safe.\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d informed the waitress, \u201cwill take about fifteen minutes. It\nhas to be cooked to order.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Laramie. \u201cI reckon I can stick it out. You tell\nthe cook he can be cookin\u2019 me a can o\u2019 coffee, at same time.\u201d\n\nHe sapiently left his hat upon the stool, as sign, and wandered\nagain, for that poignant urge of unlawful thirst nagged him.\nPresently the wail of a child penetrated through the echoes of the\nwaiting-rooms; and like a knight errant seeking the source of\ndistress he was tolled on until, quite ignorantly, he had invaded\nthe women\u2019s section. Always was soft toward kids, anyhow.\n\nThis was an unhappy, protesting kid, asylumed in the lap of a plump\nyoung woman who, brightly if (to eyes other than Laramie\u2019s) somewhat\nextravagantly appareled, in vain hushed it and rocked it. Gazing\ndown, these he saw; and the woman, gazing up, saw him--a rough red\nhead, breaking his seamed countenance into a quizzical smile.\n\n\u201cThat yore kid, ma\u2019am?\u201d asked Laramie.\n\nShe answered, rather frightened, and clasping the child more\nclosely:\n\n\u201cMy sister\u2019s. Not mine--no!\u201d\n\nA comely young woman, she, with round cheeks and sloe-black\nappealing eyes. Laramie\u2019s heart fluttered responsively.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter of him? Sick?\u201d\n\n\u201cHungry, I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you feed him?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo mooney. Lost my mooney.\u201d The plaintive foreign intonation was\ndelicious. Laramie seized upon her helplessness.\n\n\u201cHey? Where you goin\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cDenver. Don\u2019t know now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYore man out there?\u201d\n\n\u201cGot no man. My sister\u2019s man send me mooney to bring baby. Now I\nlost my mooney. I teenk baby hungry. No breakfast.\u201d\n\n\u201cGee!\u201d Laramie commiserated. \u201cHow long you been here?\u201d\n\n\u201cFive hour. I not know what to do.\u201d Her wondrous eyes swam.\n\n\u201cGosh!\u201d quoth Laramie. \u201cI\u2019m yore man. You throw in with me. Gimme\nthe kid. I\u2019ve wrestled calves.\u201d\n\nHe took the child; he brazenly dragged her up; and to her alarmed\nexpostulations forced her on--\n\nMr. Bunyan, picking his teeth, crossed the trail.\n\n\u201cOho, my man! Already at \u2018work,\u2019 are you? Didn\u2019t look far, eh? Tut,\ntut! You can do better than that!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou--get--out o\u2019 my way!\u201d Laramie growled, suffused with wrath at the\nindictment from this satisfied, plethoric slanderer who alleged to\nhave caught him at something or other, to no credit.\n\n                 *       *       *       *       *\n\nLaramie proceeded. He swept his hat from the stool.\n\n\u201cSet there, now.\u201d The waitress was just bearing in the platter. \u201cI\ngot the chuck done already ordered. Here she comes. And say!\u201d\nLaramie burst out. \u201cIf \u2019taint enough, you order more. Then you buy\nsome sort o\u2019 ticket. I haint but twenty-five dollars, odd; here\n\u2019tis.\u201d He had fumbled in his hip pocket, and he plumped his buckskin\nsack into her unwilling lap.\n\n\u201cNo, no!\u201d protested the young woman in perplexity.\n\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d rebuked Laramie. \u201cShucks! There\u2019s plenty more where that\ncome from. Fust you see it, and then you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHe beat retreat, lest the incident be noticed. Now he was vastly\nrelieved. Had had his fill of city life, anyhow. He strolled the\nlength of the counter and paused to point.\n\n\u201cHow much are them sinkers?\u201d he demanded.\n\n\u201cDoughnuts? Two for a nickel.\u201d\n\n\u201cGimme a dozen and keep the change,\u201d directed Laramie. And he parted\nwith his remaining fifty cents.\n\nToting away the sack, at last he felt like himself--busted. He\nswaggered through the station outskirts and into the yards; and at a\nstring of empty stock-cars finally found a brakeman whom he knew.\n\n                 *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe 77 was at the tail-end of loading when he appeared, tousled and\nredeyed from journey by freight, at the camp near town--he having\nhopped off, convenient.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Laramie! Whoopee! Thought you were in Kansas City.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I was,\u201d said Laramie; and he took mental note of the ravages of\ntime in that period of his absence. All the outfit had not come to\nyet. \u201cHowdy, Tex? Need a hand?\u201d\n\nTex faced him.\n\n\u201cBy jiminy! Out by passenger, back by freight! Or did you _walk_!\nBusted, I\u2019ll bet.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou win,\u201d granted Laramie.\n\n\u201cWhat was it this time special? Liquor, cards or women?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, this time it was women,\u201d Laramie confessed, shamed.\n\n\u201cI knowed it!\u201d Tex vowed disgustedly. \u201cI wont ask you where you\u2019ve\nbeen or what you\u2019ve done. No use. Shore, you\u2019ve a job. Your stuff is\njust as you left it. Oh, heck!\u201d groaned Tex, lapsing into the lingo.\n\u201cYou fellers never l\u2019arn nothin\u2019. Easy come, easy go. You ought to\nwear that for your brand.\u201d\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d said Laramie, humble and crimson. \u201cI never did have no sense.\nI\u2019m a shore brute. What hawss do I ride ag\u2019in, fust?\u201d",
