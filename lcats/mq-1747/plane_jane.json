And ain\u2019t there another sort of girl who transforms\nherself into the most beautiful when she appears in a filmy evenin\u2019 gown\nand waits for you to waft her out into the moonlight? Then there\u2019s another\nthat becomes the one and only when she is wool from head to toe and\ncuddlin\u2019 beside you on a toboggan. And there\u2019s one who is a shade above\nVenus when she comes slashin\u2019 out of the surf glistenin\u2019 and lithe and\nfresh.\n\nJane Alton wasn\u2019t any of these kinds, but, oh, what a dream she was in a\nflyin\u2019 suit! Jane was born to ornament the air. With a stick in her hand\nand flyin\u2019 joy in her eyes, she was an angel--and, of course, bein\u2019 an\nangel, she belonged in the sky. She put herself there every chance she\ngot!\n\nIt was a mornin\u2019 full of smooth air and high visibility when Jane came\nrompin\u2019 around the hangars, shinin\u2019 leather all over and, seein\u2019 us,\nsmiled brighter \u2019n the sun and ran straight for our plane.\n\nNed Knight was in the fore cubby, jazzin\u2019 the motor, ready for a take-off.\nHe grinned and remarked over his shoulder:\n\n\u201cBenny, ol\u2019 nut-twister, here\u2019s where you lose your seat, back there.\nJane\u2019s all set to take another trip to her home port, Heaven, and there\u2019s\nno use tryin\u2019 to stop her. Better start gettin\u2019 out.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d already begun startin\u2019, and I was all the way out when Jane came up\nlaughin\u2019.\n\n\u201cThank you, you ol\u2019 darlin\u2019,\u201d she said to me, and I ain\u2019t so old, either.\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait another minute to get up into all that glorious sky. Ned,\nwould you mind changin\u2019 back to Benny\u2019s seat?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d barked Ned. \u201cListen, Jane. I\u2019m takin\u2019 this little Alton up for a\ncheck-ride. Your Dad is waitin\u2019 for the data on it. Just this time won\u2019t\nyou ride in back, just this once, and lemme--\u201d\n\n\u201cNed Knight,\u201d came back Jane, \u201cam I not the holder of a pilot\u2019s license?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but--\u201d\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you, my only instructor, pronounced me to be a flyer equal to any\nother you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sure are, Jane, but--\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t I handle that stick and do a good job of gatherin\u2019 data myself?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sayin\u2019 you can\u2019t, but--\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want me to go up in another plane, _without you_, Ned Knight?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Ned, and so he began gettin\u2019 out!\n\nMe, I couldn\u2019t \u2019ve held out half that long against Jane Alton. I was\nplenty crazy about that girl, but bein\u2019 only a grease-monkey, and havin\u2019 a\nmap resemblin\u2019 a mauled-up bulldog\u2019s, I confined myself to bein\u2019 just her\nslave. Ned Knight, however, being the best flyer in the state, and the\nhandsomest in six, got a lot of time from her. I suspected maybe that\nthere was some kind of romance goin\u2019 on there, between the flyer and the\ndaughter of the plant owner, \u2019cause they flew a lot together, those two.\n\nSo, with Ned back in the rear pit, Jane climbed into the front one,\nsettled to the controls, jazzed the motor, and waved one tiny gloved hand\nto me. I socked the blocks; she stepped on the gas; and the Alton was off.\nIt trundled to the other edge of the sand, and Jane pulled it up neatly;\nshe circled twice, got herself a nice lot of altitude, rode a few air\nwaves in sheer joy, and then deadheaded across the blue.\n\nNow and then she cut the motor. Say, there wasn\u2019t any tellin\u2019 what went on\nbetween them two, all alone up there, so close to Heaven! I know they\ndidn\u2019t exactly dislike the open solitude of that sky! I remember once,\nwhen Jane hopped out of the Alton, after a spell of hootin\u2019 with Ned, she\nsaid to him: \u201cI _love_ to be all alone with you up there!\u201d And Ned was\nnever quite the same when he came down from a flit with Jane, anyhow!\n\nWell, while the Alton was banking and skimming at about a thousand, Robert\nBennett Alton himself came out onto the field. He was owner of the field,\nand of the factory where the Altons were made. He was manufacturing a\nsturdy, speedy, almost foolproof plane that was just about the ultimate in\naviation on a small scale. A man dissatisfied with anything short of\nperfection--that was Alton. And a fine man, in and out from the heart. He\nstood beside me, watching his little moth weave across the sky.\n\n\u201cWhat a ship!\u201d I said. \u201cWhat a joy of a ship!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems to handle well, Benny,\u201d was all Alton said. \u201cWhat--what\u2019s that?\u201d\n\nStarin\u2019, I went cold. From the front of the plane some black smoke spouted\nout; and then came the flashin\u2019 of fire. Fire it was! The nose of that\nplane was bein\u2019 licked by the flames leapin\u2019 back from the engine. One\nsecond it had been all o. k., and the next it was pushin\u2019 a bonfire\nthrough the sky! If the fire reached the gasoline lines and the tank--if\nit kindled the linen--it meant disaster! And I, myself, I had inspected\nthat ship to make sure it was o. k. All but passin\u2019 out, I continued to\nstare, and Mr. Alton got as white as the clouds.\n\n\u201cBenny, who\u2019s pilotin\u2019 that ship?\u201d\n\n\u201cJane!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d\n\nNow the plane was sideslippin\u2019 away from the flames; it tore off them, and\nthey disappeared.\n\n\u201cAnd Jane knows her stuff!\u201d I shouted.\n\nOnce havin\u2019 snapped away from the danger, Jane dove at full throttle, but\nthe fire flashed out again, worse than before. As soon as it did, Jane\nsideslipped again, and the wind put the fire out. This time when she\nrecovered she banked steep, gradually losin\u2019 altitude and made for the T.\nMushin\u2019 out, she cut the gun, and the Alton glided for the sand. The fire\npopped out again, not so bad this time, but bad enough!\n\nThe burnin\u2019 ship trundled in, and before it stopped Ned Knight was out of\nit. Jane jumped right behind him. Ned scooped up sand and threw it on the\nfire, and Jane worked just as fast. Mr. Alton and me and some of the other\nboys ran for the ship, but by the time we got there, the fire was all out.\n\nNed Knight, plenty mad, stepped up to me chin first. \u201cBenny, your job is\nto keep these ships in trim, ain\u2019t it--\u2019specially this one, that\u2019s goin\u2019\nto fly the race--or was! Then how come the timin\u2019 is off, and fire got\nsucked back into the carburetor? I\u2019ll bet my hat that the screen and drain\nis in bad shape, too, you--. Good gosh!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I got it out all right, didn\u2019t I?\u201d inquired Jane, who seemed to\nthink that any scrape wasn\u2019t very bad if she got out of it alive.\n\n\u201cYou sure did! You got us out like a veteran. Jane, you\u2019re all right.\nBenny, dang you--\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t wastin\u2019 time standin\u2019 there and bein\u2019 bawled out. I put my head\ninto that motor, and it took only a minute for me to find out that some\nmonkey business had been goin on--grease-monkey business! The engine had\nbeen tampered with. Our pet Alton! The ship we were dressin\u2019 for the race!\nAnd with Jane in it! Lord!\n\nI whirled around and barked out my troubles. And then there was plenty of\nquiet for a minute.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nNed Knight moved first. Some other members of the hangar crew had come\nout to share the excitement. He singled out a pilot named Stud Walker, and\nstepped right up to him. Ugly eyes that man had, and an ugly face, and an\nugly heart--Walker. His eyes sort of flashed with fear, and he tried to\nback away, but Ned had him nailed.\n\n\u201cWalker, lemme ask you some questions! Last night, while I was fussin\u2019\naround the field, I heard somebody inside this Alton\u2019s hangar. That was\nstrange. By the time I got it unlocked, and went inside, the noises\nstopped, and the hangar was empty. But I found a hole in the sand, under\nthe tin wall, that was fresh dug, and that hole was hid by two empty oil\nbarrels. You know anything about that? I\u2019ll answer for you. You know _all_\nabout it. You\u2019re the man that tampered with the plane!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t prove--\u201d Walker gulped.\n\n\u201cYour guilty face proves it for me! I\u2019m goin\u2019 to smash--\u201d\n\nNed began to sail in with both hands and feet, but I grabbed him. While he\nwas talkin\u2019, two other greaseballs had got behind Walker, and blocked his\nretreat. Also, they kept Ned from killin\u2019 him. And right then Mr. Robert\nBennett Alton himself stepped up and spoke.\n\n\u201cNed, if you\u2019re accusin\u2019 this man of tamperin\u2019 with that plane, I hope you\ncan prove what you say.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Alton,\u201d Ned came back, \u201csome time ago I caught Walker tappin\u2019 a gin\nbottle on the field, and ever since then I\u2019ve been watchin\u2019 him. A few\ndays ago he acted funny. I watched closer. After dark a sedan drew up, and\nWalker got in. The car stayed, and I watched it. Inside it was Gifford, at\nthe wheel--Gifford, of the Stormbird people. He and Walker were talkin\u2019\nlow. Then I saw Gifford pass money to Walker. That is proof enough for me\nthat he\u2019s in Gifford\u2019s pay, working against us. He was clever enough to\njim the plane so I couldn\u2019t find the trouble last night, but he\u2019s got\nnow!\u201d\n\nWalker looked plenty sick. Alton looked at him, and he couldn\u2019t look back.\nHe might \u2019ve killed Ned Knight and Jane--Jane!--with his trick, done for\npay. He couldn\u2019t face the man that had hired him out of good faith.\n\n\u201cWalker, you look guilty!\u201d Alton spoke up. \u201cYou\u2019ve tried to cripple us in\nfavor of the Stormbird people--so they can win over us, of course, in the\nair derby tomorrow. Thank the Lord you won\u2019t have a chance to get in any\nmore of your dirty work! The Stormbirds are so afraid that we\u2019ll outfly\nthem that they have to hire crooks to beat us, eh? Do you know, Walker,\nthat you could be jailed for what you\u2019ve done?\u201d\n\nWalker was white around the gills.\n\n\u201cWalker, I don\u2019t want to bother with you. I think too little of you and\nwhat you\u2019ve done to prefer charges against you. Now, Walker, get off this\nfield. Get off! If you show your face on it again, man, I\u2019ll break you\nwith my bare hands!\u201d\n\nAlton didn\u2019t usually say much, but this was plenty for the occasion, and\nhe meant every word. Alton\u2019s contempt was worse than a lickin\u2019 for Walker\nto take. Let loose, he shambled away, looks of disgust and hate followin\u2019\nhim. When he disappeared around the hangars, the field seemed like a\nbetter place to stay.\n\nMr. Alton spoke quietly now to the boys, askin\u2019 \u2019em to look over the\nplanes careful, suggestin\u2019 that a guard be put around the hangars tonight\nso that nothin\u2019 could happen to the planes before the start of the air\nrace the next day; and they\u2019d better keep a gun handy; and--\n\n\u201cNed!\u201d Jane called out, not bein\u2019 able to hold herself in any longer.\n\u201cPlease, let\u2019s get another plane out and go right back up!\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201cJane,\u201d Mr. Alton said, \u201cI want to talk with Ned a little, so you\u2019d better\nlet the flyin\u2019 go a while. Benny, is that ship damaged much?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d I answered. \u201cBy adjusting the timer and putting in a screen,\nand some new ignition wires--they\u2019re burned off--she\u2019ll be shipshape\nagain.\u201d\n\n\u201cStart on it right away,\u201d Mr. Alton told me. \u201cNed, how did the ship feel\ntoday?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter than ever before,\u201d Knight answered. \u201cJane was at the stick, but I\ncould feel the pull of the new prop. We get the proper revs now when we\u2019re\nclimbing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe stabilizer?\u201d\n\n\u201cWorks like a dream. The ship\u2019s as steady as a Rolls Royce on Fifth Avenue\nand she stays that way. Also, it\u2019s easier to hold her head up. And the\nailerons can be used when she\u2019s throttled way down--that\u2019s somethin\u2019\nthat\u2019s improved with the new prop and stabilizer. She\u2019s ready for any race\nnow, Mr. Alton.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d said the Boss.\n\nThe boys\u2019d been helpin\u2019 me to roll the plane tail-to into the hangar, and\nthen, leavin\u2019 Mr. Alton, Jane, Ned and me in there alone, they went back\nto work. I tore off the old ignition wires while Mr. Alton talked.\n\n\u201cNed, are you ready to fly your best tomorrow? Goin\u2019 to reach Curtiss\nahead of all the other entries, are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure he is!\u201d spoke up Jane. \u201cI\u2019m his mascot!\u201d\n\n\u201cI think your plane is a better flyer than any other in the line-up, Mr.\nAlton,\u201d Ned answered. \u201cThe Stormbird will tail us, but we\u2019ll win.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope so!\u201d Mr. Alton came back, sighin\u2019. \u201cNed, I\u2019m goin\u2019 to take you\ninto my confidence. You\u2019re goin\u2019 to pilot that ship tomorrow, and Benny\nwill be along with you, and you both ought to know that I\u2019m bankin\u2019 on you\nboys heavily. Aside from the purse--which, of course, the pilot is goin\u2019\nto keep, for he\u2019s the man that is goin\u2019 to earn it--the reputation of the\nAlton is at stake. The number of accidents that have happened recently in\nAltons has given us a black-eye, Ned--you know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019ll forget that when we zip across the finish field first,\u201d Ned\nanswered.\n\n\u201cThey will--if we win,\u201d Mr. Alton answered. \u201cThat will help. But that\u2019s\nnot all. That ill will has hurt our business. We have been runnin\u2019 on a\nshoestring--and we\u2019ve just about reached the end of it. We need the\nwinnin\u2019 place in this race because of the good it will do our business. If\nwe don\u2019t come in number one, Ned, I\u2019m afraid that we\u2019ll have to be closing\nup the plant soon.\u201d\n\nNed got pale, and I forgot work, and Jane listened plumb excited. Mr.\nAlton was talkin\u2019 in a low, serious tone. Since the Alton plant was all\nany of us had in life right then, it was serious. We knew business had\nbeen bad, but we never suspected it was that bad--never suspected that\nthis air derby was becomin\u2019 a life and death matter for Alton planes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain a little more,\u201d Mr. Alton went on, solemn and quiet. \u201cYou\nknow that the United Airways is holding up a large order of planes--enough\nto keep us busy for the better part of a year--and will place its order\ndependin\u2019 on the outcome of the race tomorrow. They\u2019re lookin\u2019 for speed\nand stamina, and they think they\u2019ll find it in the winnin\u2019 ship. I had a\ntalk with Finley, the manager, last night. \u2018Win the race, and I\u2019ll place\nmy order with you,\u2019 he said. That\u2019s how the matter stands. And that United\norder, if we get it, will save our lives.\u201d\n\nLord!\n\n\u201cThere are other orders in the balance, too,\u201d Mr. Alton went on. \u201cThe\ngovernment is going to give the winner some places in the air mail and\nborder patrol fleets, to replace the antiquated DeHavilands. There\u2019s a\npassenger airport in Texas that I\u2019ve been tryin\u2019 to land, that\u2019s waitin\u2019\nfor the winner to take the order away from it. I could name half a dozen\nmore such examples; but it isn\u2019t necessary.\n\n\u201cYou understand, Ned, that when you fly tomorrow, you\u2019ll be flyin\u2019 to\nwin--win not only the purse for yourself, but a new life for us. And if\nyou lose--but we won\u2019t think about that now. You\u2019re goin\u2019 to win.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Ned. \u201cWe\u2019re goin\u2019 to win!\u201d He gave a look at Jane, and\nJane\u2019s eyes sparkled. \u201cThere\u2019s still another reason why I\u2019m goin\u2019 to win,\nMr. Alton!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is?\u201d\n\n\u201cA pilot that ain\u2019t married usually hasn\u2019t got a habit of savin\u2019 his\nmoney--and I\u2019ve spent all mine, till lately. But if I had to buy a house\nand a lot of furniture, right now, I couldn\u2019t do it. But with that purse\nin my pocket--five thousand dollars--it wouldn\u2019t be so hard! I want to do\nthat, Mr. Alton. I want to win that race, and then step up to you, and\nsay, \u2018Sir, I want to marry your daughter!\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Alton smiled. \u201cFrom Jane\u2019s conversation at home, which has just two\nsubjects--flyin\u2019 and Ned--I\u2019d suspected the situation.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cI\u2019d\nrather have a pilot for a son-in-law than anybody else, and of all the\npilots I know, you rate highest with me, Ned. Well, after you win that\nrace, and step up to me, and say your say, I\u2019ll talk with you about it!\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks!\u201d\n\nMr. Alton walked out of the hangar, havin\u2019 said _his_ say to us--which was\nplenty. For a few minutes I was stunned. Things was comin\u2019 too fast for\nme. That whole big plant, out there, was in danger of vanishin\u2019. Those\npeppy little Altons were in danger of eventually droppin\u2019 out of the air.\nAltons had been the subject of our talk and dreams for years, and if they\nwent--it would be worse than a death in the family. And yet, there the\nwhole matter was, flat up and lookin\u2019 us in the face-- and all of us\nswore, right then, that this Alton _had_ to win that race!\n\nI turned and got to work on it--and how I began to work!\n\nSomethin\u2019 that happened behind me sounded a whole lot like a kiss.\n\n\u201cSo!\u201d said Jane Alton. \u201cYou think, do you, Ned Knight, that you\u2019re goin\u2019\nto win me in a race as though I was a kewpie doll on a rack?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy--\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if you don\u2019t win the race, you won\u2019t ask me to marry you at all?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, gosh!\u201d\n\n\u201cYoung man,\u201d said Jane in her most business-like manner, \u201cI have somethin\u2019\nto say to you--in private!\u201d\n\nShe tugged him out of the hangar. Beyond the doors I could hear \u2019em\nwhisperin\u2019. Then they moved away, and I didn\u2019t see either of \u2019em again\nthat day--because I wasn\u2019t lookin\u2019 at anythin\u2019 but that plane.\n\nI worked on her like a maniac. I forgot lunch and dinner and kept workin\u2019\non her till my arms were about ready to drop off. I wouldn\u2019t let anybody\nelse touch her. I tested her everywhere, tuned her to the prettiest pitch\nshe could give, tightened her everywhere she would tighten. There wasn\u2019t\nany dingus on that plane that I overlooked. When I called a halt it was\nafter midnight.\n\nThen I put blankets beside her, and tried to go to sleep; but I couldn\u2019t\nsleep. I had to get up and look her over again. Every half hour after that\nI was up, to make sure I\u2019d tested somethin\u2019 that I thought I _might_ have\noverlooked. I couldn\u2019t stay away from that plane. Too much was dependin\u2019\non it and the shape it was in.\n\nAnd at last, as I was for the tenth time feelin\u2019 over the control wires, I\nsaw light comin\u2019 through the cracks of the door, and I knew it was\ntomorrow.\n\nThe day of the Trans-state Air Derby had come!\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was the day of days. All over the country, airplane makers had been\nlookin\u2019 forward to this day, and preparin\u2019 for it. Every maker of light\nplanes was goin\u2019 to be represented with the best job they could turn out.\nA string of single-motored planes was goin\u2019 to line up, every one ready to\ndo its best, and compete for the championship--and the competition was\ngoin\u2019 to be murder! A big Commission was behind the project, directin\u2019 it.\nNewspapers all over the world were runnin\u2019 notices of it, \u2019cause the\nresults were goin\u2019 to be official; and the winner\u2019s name was goin\u2019 to be\nwritten right into air history in big red letters.\n\nThere\u2019d been guards outside the hangar all night; and when a knock came, I\nopened the doors. Ned Knight, fresh and dapper, came in, bringin\u2019 a early\nmornin\u2019 paper. He showed it to me. Splashed all over the front page was\nbig headlines: _Planes Ready For Big Cross Country Race!_ There below was\nthe list of makers: Alton, Stormbird, Zephyr, Lightning, Ranbros, Impco,\nand all of \u2019em. And then the pilot\u2019s name: Alton carryin\u2019 Ben Benson and\npiloted by Ned Knight. Stormbird carryin\u2019 William Carson and piloted by--\n\n\u201cGood gosh, Ned!\u201d I busted out. \u201cThat must be a misprint!\u201d\n\n\u201cNope, Benny; it must be true. Stormbird\u2019s made a change in pilots at the\nlast minute.\u201d\n\nRight there in black and white it said that the pilot of the Stormbird\nentry was goin\u2019 to be Stud Walker! Stud Walker, the self-same crook that\nwe\u2019d fired off the field--who had been in Stormbird pay, and jimmed our\nplane! It was easy to see that Stormbird was usin\u2019 him because Walker\nwould be hell-bent to beat us out, for our handlin\u2019 of him. We were goin\u2019\nto have a real enemy flyin\u2019 against us!\n\n\u201cGosh!\u201d I croaked. \u201cNed, we can sure count on Walker\u2019s beatin\u2019 us if he\npossibly can. He\u2019ll fly like a wild man to beat us!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 to do some flyin\u2019 myself,\u201d Ned came back. \u201cIs the plane ready,\nBenny? If it is, we\u2019d better be gettin\u2019 over the field. We\u2019ve got to check\nin and get lined up. Mr. Alton has drawn third place for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThird? Who\u2019s second and first?\u201d\n\n\u201cImpco is second.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd--?\u201d\n\n\u201cStormbird is first.\u201d\n\n\u201cHang it all! They\u2019re gettin\u2019 the breaks all around. I suppose it figures\nout all right in the end, but-- I hate to have \u2019em leadin\u2019 us at the very\nstart!\u201d\n\n\u201cBenny, aren\u2019t you goin to dress up? Those overalls of yours \u2019re dirty\nenough to walk around by themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t change \u2019em for a suit of ermine, Ned,\u201d I answered. \u201cThey may\nbe dirty as mud, but I love \u2019em!\u201d\n\nThen, Ned tells me, we should be on our way. We roll the plane out, and\nblock her; Ned gets in, contacts her, and we pump the prop. She roars off,\nhigher and higher, and the engine begins to warm and sing a sweet song.\nWhen she\u2019s hot, she\u2019s the sweetest soundin\u2019 motor I ever heard. Grinnin\u2019\nall over our faces, Ned and I get set. She steps off down the field,\nswings into the air, and away we go, for the startin\u2019 field, as full of\nhope as any man could be without bustin\u2019.\n\nPretty soon the field slides into view. There\u2019s a crowd pushin\u2019 around on\nit, and lined up, staggered in back of each other, are planes. We circle\nand come down, and taxi smoothly across the field. Then we ground-loop\nneatly, and come amblin\u2019 back. Ned cuts the motor, and we hop out. For a\nminute we\u2019re busy registerin\u2019, and then official greaseballs push the\nplane into place, third in the line.\n\nAnd there\u2019s the Stormbird, our deadly opponent, with its nose \u2019way out in\nfront. As we come past it, the pilot comes away from it. It is Walker,\nlookin\u2019 uglier \u2019n ever, with gloatin\u2019 eyes and crooked sneer. We give him\nhard looks and want to go on, but he has somethin\u2019 to say.\n\n\u201cYesterday was your innin\u2019, you hooters. Today is mine. I\u2019m goin\u2019 to fly\nyou off the map!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot in that wash-tub!\u201d I come back.\n\n\u201cHush up, Benny!\u201d Ned nudges me. \u201cWalker, you\u2019re takin\u2019 all the joy out of\nthis race. We want to fly with real flyers, not with crooks. Depend on it,\nman, we don\u2019t intend to be beaten by dirty play. And if you fly square,\nWalker-- you\u2019ve only primed yourself for the lickin\u2019 of your life!\u201d\n\nWalker glares a killin\u2019 look at us, and cusses us out as we pass on.\n\nThen there\u2019s a squeal, and Jane Alton comes rushin\u2019 around the line of\nofficials, followed by her Dad. She runs up to Ned and, right out in\npublic, gives him a big kiss. She talks fast as a whirlwind, bein\u2019 all\njazzed up with excitement and hope. Her Dad just shakes us by the hand and\nsays:\n\n\u201cIn a few minutes you\u2019ll be off, boys. Remember--we\u2019re goin\u2019 to win.\u201d\n\nWe promise him--our hearts in our throats. That big Stormbird looks like a\nflyin\u2019 devil to us and winnin\u2019 won\u2019t be a cinch for anybody.\n\nJane asks, breathless: \u201cNed, won\u2019t you _please_ take me along?\u201d\n\nNed laughs. \u201cNo, Jane. It can\u2019t be done. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, please!\u201d she begs.\n\nAnd he chuckles again, \u201cNo!\u201d\n\nMr. Alton closes in then for a confidential talk with Ned; and Jane, in a\nminute, grabs my sleeve and pulls me a little bit aside.\n\n\u201cBenny, will you do somethin\u2019 for me?\u201d\n\n\u201cJane,\u201d I says, \u201cAll you\u2019ve got to do is ask.\u201d\n\nShe pulls me aside a little farther. \u201cWould you do it for me, even if it\nmeant a lot to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Jane,\u201d I say, \u201cI guess I can equal anybody so far as doin\u2019 things\nfor you is concerned. You know that.\u201d\n\nShe tugs me still farther, and we\u2019re gettin\u2019 close to the locker room.\n\n\u201cBenny,\u201d she says then, \u201cI want to fly in this race with Ned.\u201d\n\nI choke up at that unexpected request, but I might \u2019a\u2019 known Jane would\n\u2019ve been dyin\u2019 to get up in the air on this big occasion.\n\n\u201cGosh, Jane!\u201d I say. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t stow you away. It\u2019d overweight the plane\nand hurt our chances to--\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t want to stowaway!\u201d she says. \u201cI want you to let me take your\nplace!\u201d\n\nOh, boy! She was askin\u2019 the impossible. There she was, with her implorin\u2019\nblue eyes close to mine, eyes shinin\u2019 with hope and fire, and beggin\u2019 me,\nbeggin\u2019 me. No, sir, I couldn\u2019t let her do that--but there she was, a girl\nI just couldn\u2019t refuse if she\u2019d asked for my life. Lettin\u2019 her go up in my\nplace would be a crazy thing to do, but she kept beggin\u2019 me with little\npleases and won\u2019t-yous, and Bennies, spoken soft like, and--Lord!\n\n\u201cIf you let me get into your coveralls, and helmet and goggles, nobody\u2019ll\never know the diff\u2019rence!\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cJane, please don\u2019t go beggin\u2019 me!\u201d I begged her. \u201cIt ain\u2019t fair to me. I\ncan\u2019t resist you any more \u2019n the tail of a plane can resist the prop. You\nknow Ned would blow up if he heard of it, and your Dad--and Lord!\u201d\n\n\u201cBenny, it\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve ever asked of you; and it means more to\nme than anything else in the world right now. I\u2019ve _got_ to fly in that\nrace--_got_ to. Benny--Benny--please!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Lord!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll you\u2019d have to do is slip into that private locker and take off those\noveralls, and then stay out of sight. I\u2019d just get in \u2019em, and climb into\nthe plane, and stay there. Benny--please?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do any good up there--\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know that Ned will fly worlds better if I\u2019m along with him? And\nyou want us to win, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Lord!\u201d I said. \u201cWell--here goes!\u201d\n\nRight then she flung her arms around my neck, hugged me close, and kissed\nme one, two, three times right on the lips, and said, \u201cOh, Benny!\u201d And\nafter that I wasn\u2019t nearly in my right mind. I dived into the locker, shed\nmy overalls, and eased out again. With one last look at her, I dived into\nthe crowd and lost myself.\n\nJane hurried into the locker, and in a minute she was out, in my coveralls\nand helmet and goggles. I could hardly believe my eyes, she looked so much\nlike me! It was sure astonishin\u2019. She eased back toward the planes, just\nwhen a guy in a megaphone was shoutin\u2019 the last warnin\u2019. Jane walked right\npast Ned and Mr. Alton and made for the plane.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to get into the ship!\u201d Ned said. \u201cSay, where\u2019s Jane? Ain\u2019t she\ngoin\u2019 to wish me good luck?\u201d\n\nThey looked around for her, while she was within ten feet of \u2019em.\n\n\u201cSay, Benny, have you seen Jane?\u201d Ned hollered at her; and she wags her\nhead: no!\n\nThe last minute is gone; and Ned is forced to his plane. Jane was already\nin when he got there; he climbs in, not givin\u2019 her any special notice.\nThere is a poppin\u2019 and roarin\u2019 of motors all around, up and down the line.\nGreaseballs turn the Alton over, and she sings a sweet tune. The whole\nline-up is stirrin\u2019 up a tornado when _bang!_ a shot-gun goes off--which\nmeans the race is started!\n\nThe Stormbird tears off like a maniac, lifts, climbs steady, and then\ndeadheads on. Thirty seconds pass, forty, fifty, sixty. Then, _bango!_ the\ngun goes off again, and the Imp plane stretches itself out across the\nsand. It lifts, roars, pulls on, and flies in the wake of the Stormbird.\n\nNed Knight bends to his stick and glues his eyes to the instrument. The\nseconds are tickin\u2019 off. Forty--fifty--sixty! _Whacko!_ The gun! Ned\nstomps on the gas. Away goes the Alton. It takes off quick, climbs fast\nand, roarin\u2019 high, plows into the sky.\n\nAnd I, back on the field, watch it go with tears in my eyes!\n\nOne by one, at sixty-second intervals, the planes take off, and soon\nthey\u2019re parading along the sky, and trailin\u2019 out of sight. Once they\u2019re\ngone, there is nothin\u2019 to do but wait for reports along the way. The crowd\nlingers, and I avoid Mr. Alton. He goes to his car; I just float around.\nWhat\u2019s happenin\u2019 to Ned and Jane now, I wonder? What\u2019s goin to happen to\n\u2019em as they drive across half a dozen states. Are they goin\u2019 to pull onto\nLong Island and get down to Curtiss first? Oh, Lord!\n\nWell, plenty happened in that plane on the way, and this is what!\n\nNed Knight concentrated on his controls as he had never concentrated\nbefore. In the back seat Jane just sat and enjoyed herself. Little by\nlittle the Alton went up to her top speed. With the throttle gradually\nopened, she tore through the sky screaming. With the wires shrieking, the\nstruts rattling, the whole plane trembling and throbbing, it roared on its\nway, hell-bent for victory.\n\nThe string of planes kept goin\u2019 across the sky spaced like they were at\nthe take off for a while. At the Ohio line one of them began to drop, and\ntook to the ground, disabled, and disqualified, \u2019cause the race was a\nnon-stop affair. Another one soon followed. Others began to draw back a\nlittle, and still others drove ahead a little. And while Ned was strivin\u2019\nto pass the Impco and reach the Stormbird, Jane removed her helmet and\ngoggles, and then reached forward and gently tapped his shoulder.\n\nNed looked back; for a minute he thought he was dreamin\u2019. Then he shouted\nsomething that was lost in the thunder of the motors, and bored on. He\ncouldn\u2019t snap off the ignition a minute; \u2019t would slow the plane. Jane\nsmiled at him, still enjoyin\u2019 every minute; and then he looked back again,\nand grinned. He\u2019d caught onto the joy of the thing and then Jane was\nsatisfied.\n\nNed bent to his controls again, for the Impco was slippin\u2019 closer. It\nwasn\u2019t bearin\u2019 up under the continued, terrific strain. Ned grasped the\nopportunity and kept the throttle wide open. Bit by bit the Impco slid\nback, and Ned gave it a wide berth. Slowly, but surely, the Alton\nadvanced. For miles the planes bobbed side by side; and then the Alton\ncrept forward, inch by inch, until it was leadin\u2019.\n\nJane gaily waved at the Impco pilot and threw him a couple of kisses!\n\nThe Alton bored on, and Ned concentrated on the Stormbird. It was still\nthundering on, a strong ship, much better than the Imp, perhaps equal to\nours--perhaps even better! Ned kept the throttle wide; and Jane settled\ndown to the serious business of takin\u2019 the lead.\n\nThe earth was bobbin\u2019 below the planes, slidin\u2019 by gentle but fast; one\ntown and another came into view and disappeared. And then the Alton began\nto wobble. The motor roared up and down. Ned was actin\u2019 funny with the\ncontrols. Jane watched him close; and then she saw Ned\u2019s head bob, and his\nshoulders slide forward. Just then the ship began to dive and lose speed.\n\n\u201cNed!\u201d Jane screeched, grabbing his shoulder and shakin\u2019 him. \u201cWhat\u2019s the\nmatter?\u201d\n\nHe pulled himself together some, looked around; and in his eyes was a\ndreamy, sick look. Jane shook him again; but he acted almost drunk. His\nlips mumbled words that were lost in the motor\u2019s roar; but Jane knew that\nsomething was very much wrong with him.\n\nThe ship was losin\u2019 speed; the Stormbird was leading by a long distance;\nand even the Imp was drawing close again. Jane didn\u2019t wait for any more\ntrouble. She unsnapped her safety belt and, calm as you please, put one\nleg across and into the fore pit. Then she pulled forward, and came into\nthe pit with Ned. She crammed herself down into and on him, and grabbed\nthe stick. Ned\u2019s feet were loose on the rudder-bars, but the stabilizer\nkept the plane on an even keel without much help from the controls.\n\nJane shook Ned again; and he was conkin\u2019 out fast. He pulled off one glove\nand looked at his right hand. It was red and swole up, and across it was a\nred streak, a scratch. He looked up with eyes full of pitiful request for\nhelp, and tried to talk. Jane was desperate; she cut the switch to hear\nhim.\n\n\u201cSick,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cScratch--somebody on field. Bumped against me. Must\nbe--poisoned. Oh,--I can\u2019t--go on----\u201d\n\nAnd he slumped forward in the pit. Jane snapped on the ignition, kept the\nstick steady, pulled Ned back up, and pleaded in his ear.\n\n\u201cTry, Ned! Try to get up! Try to get back into the other pit. I\u2019ll handle\nthe stick. You get back--try! Please try!\u201d\n\nSick as he was, he tried. He dragged himself up and tottered in the air,\nwhile Jane assisted all she could. Then Ned tumbled into the rear pit,\nhalf on the seat, and without makin\u2019 a move to get up, passed out\ncompletely.\n\nJane settled to the controls with all the fire she had--which was plenty!\nShe snapped on the ignition and opened the throttle wide as she could. The\nmotor blasted. The plane almost jumped ahead. The Imp, which was almost\nnose to nose with the Alton again, gradually dropped back. There was the\nStormbird, far ahead. Jane fixed her blue eyes on that plane, and kept the\nthrottle open, and prayed.\n\nShe didn\u2019t understand perfectly then what had happened to Ned. It was\nthis: while he was on the field, talkin\u2019 with Alton--while Jane was\ntalkin\u2019 with me, private!--somebody brushed past him, and then Ned\ndiscovered a scratch on his hand, lookin\u2019 like it was made by a pin. He\nthought nothin\u2019 of it, but that scratch was full of a drug. What it was we\ndon\u2019t know yet, but it was powerful, and without the shadow of a doubt it\nhad been used by somebody in the Stormbird people\u2019s pay--somebody,\nprobably at Stud Walker\u2019s behest. The object was to put the Alton out of\nthe race by cripplin\u2019 its pilot--and, if it hadn\u2019t been for Jane, the\ntrick would have succeeded! But with Jane at the stick, it was far from\nsucceedin\u2019!\n\nJane stretched that ship to the limit. The Imp bobbed far behind.\nTerritory unreeled under her. The Stormbird loomed large again. Both ships\nwere goin\u2019 their limit. The race settled down to a question of which ship\nhad the more speed and power and stamina, and the victor would be decided\nby a very narrow margin. Jane kept the throttle wide, and waited for the\nAlton to do its stuff--and it did.\n\nSlowly she drew up. She kept the Alton on a level with the Stormbird\u2019s\ntail for a hundred miles. Then slowly the differences in the ships began\nto tell. The Alton crept up. An inch. Another inch. Another inch--forward\nalways, at a mad airspeed, the motor blasting like a demon loose out of\nhell, the whole ship shaking, the wires screaming. The earth spun and\nveered. Another inch--another. Little by little the Alton crept up on the\nStormbird until, prop even with prop, they drove ahead without either\ngainin\u2019 a mite.\n\nOnce again the Stormbird began to slip back; and Jane--yes!--tossed Mr.\nStud Walker an ironic kiss!\n\nJane kept that ship howlin\u2019. On she went. On. The skies began to darken.\nThe air got a little bumpy. The visibility dropped. The exhaust tubes of\nthe planes, white-hot, spouted orange fire. And Jane drove on. Little by\nlittle, again, the Alton took its margin of lead.\n\nWhat was that? Water! Long Island Sound! Only a few miles away was the\nfinish field!\n\nJane kept the plane drivin\u2019. The Stormbird howled on the Alton\u2019s tail.\nBoth planes were crazy flyin\u2019 things--crazy.\n\nThen the field, the big square! Closer and closer! Jane stepped down to\nit, slowin\u2019 as little as possible. Down she swooped, and the ground swung\nup at her. She felt the trucks touch. She zipped across the sand; she\nground looped; she trundled back. And as she came to a stop, and the crowd\nstarted for her, the Stormbird dropped out of the sky.\n\nJane jumped out of her plane. She knew Ned wasn\u2019t seriously hurt, but he\nneeded help, and to the first man she saw she shouted: \u201cGet a doctor!\u201d\nThen, with reporters mobbin\u2019 her, she just smiled, gave her name and that\nof the plane, and waited until a fat man with an official badge, head of\nthe Committee, came up to her. Then she said pertly:\n\n\u201cWell, I guess I won, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nThe Committeeman was flabbergasted. He hadn\u2019t expected to see a girl.\nReporters were yowlin\u2019 for Jane\u2019s name, and facts about her, knowin\u2019 that\na girl hadn\u2019t been scheduled to pilot the Alton, and sensin\u2019 a big story.\nThe Committeeman muffed a few words, not knowin\u2019 what to do or say, but\nseein\u2019 plain enough that she had got to the field first.\n\nThen a man in leather tunic and with goggle-prints around his eyes came\npushin\u2019 through the crowd, with four other Committeemen, all lookin\u2019\nindignant and outraged. That guy was Walker--Walker was howlin\u2019.\n\n\u201cThere she is!\u201d he yelped. \u201cThis race is bein\u2019 run on the square, ain\u2019t\nit? Well, you can\u2019t rate her winner. She isn\u2019t the pilot that belongs to\nthat ship. Her name is Alton--the pilot registered for this plane is named\nKnight!\u201d\n\nThe Committeeman got red-faced and mad and still more dignified. They\nwaved a hand for silence and bellowed to the reporters, after a hot and\nfast conference among themselves:\n\n\u201cThe Alton is not the winner of this race. The Alton is not the winner! It\nis disqualified because of irregularities. The official winner of the race\nis the Stormbird, with Walker pilotin\u2019!\u201d\n\n\u201cJust a minute!\u201d Jane spoke up, pert and clear. \u201cWhere are the\nirregularities? The Alton has come through clean, without any. The pilot\nof this ship is supposed to be Knight, and it wins the race because _my\nname is_ Knight!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a poser.\n\n\u201cI intended to fly this ship all along!\u201d Jane declared. \u201cAnd I win the\nrace--\u201d\n\n\u201cYour name is Knight?\u201d the Committeemen demanded in one big voice.\n\n\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d said Jane. \u201cMrs. Ned Knight. It has been that since last\nevenin\u2019. So there!\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhenever I see Jane comin\u2019 onto the testin\u2019 field of the big, boomin\u2019,\nprosperous Alton factory, to take a little sky-spin with her husband, I\nsize her up and sigh and tell myself all over again that that girl sure\nlooks right in a flyin\u2019 suit!\n\n                                THE END",
