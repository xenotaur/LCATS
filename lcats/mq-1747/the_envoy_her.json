    "body": "Despite the concentrated patrol defenses, the Emperor's space yacht\nslipped down to the surface of Klo, second moon of Jursa, without\nincident. Only recently, such a show of force would have drawn a\nflight of torpedo rockets from the rebellious planet; but the Jursan\nagitators for a scientific renaissance had at last been beaten to\ntheir knees.\n\nA landing tube was connected between the ship and the transparent dome\nthat had been constructed on this airless satellite for the\nconvenience of the lord of the system. Notables in military posts or\npresent on some other excuse gathered to greet their master.\n\n\"By Pollux!\" gasped one onlooker. \"Those guards must all be seven feet\ntall!\"\n\nThe file of magnificent soldiers, who gave the impression of being\nalmost entirely armor-plated, deployed on either side of the landing\ntube exit. They were followed by a figure glittering enough to be an\nemperor; but since he was attended by only four officials in bejeweled\nscarlet the crowd recognized him for a chamberlain.\n\n\"His Illustrious Sublimity the Lord Vyrtl, Viceroy for Terra, Emperor\nof Pollux, and of all its fourteen planets, and of all their\nthirty-seven satellites, and of all the nations thereon, Co-ordinator\nof the planet Hebryxid--\"\n\nIt went on at some length, but the man who led the next little parade\nout of the landing tube paid no heed. The part about Terra was a\nvestige of centuries before communications had lapsed, and served no\npurpose but to remind him that new contact with the original planet\nwas one of the Jursans' aims. The rest of his titles he could, by now,\nrecite backwards.\n\nThe crowd of officialdom gaped at him as he stood there. He was a tall\nman, which conveniently helped conceal a tendency toward obesity.\nUnder the excess tissue, his face had a massive strength, with broad\nbones and jutting chin and nose; but the gray eyes were weary and\ncynical.\n\n\"Wilkins!\" he ordered in a bored monotone. \"Find which yokel is in\ncharge, and burn a jet under him!\"\n\n\n\nA resplendent aide hustled forward to where the official in charge of\nthe dome was wetting his lips over his rehearsed greeting. It was\nquickly made plain that His Illustrious Sublimity desired\ntransportation and a look at the quarters he would have to put up with\nuntil the jackals on Jursa came to their senses.\n\nThe official had tried to provide for every known imperial fancy. He\nsmirked delightfully when Vyrtl caught sight of the lozards tethered\nat one side.\n\n\"By Pollux!\" exclaimed the Emperor, his eye brightening. \"We hadn't\nexpected the pleasure of riding till this was over.\"\n\n\"He tells me they have built a forest, Sire,\" reported the aide.\n\"About half a mile square. At least, you will have some relaxation.\"\n\n\"Good! It is all very well playing the soldier and roughing it\ninformally, but a man must have _something_!\"\n\nHe surveyed the reptilian mounts that were led forward and chose one\nwhose eight legs were a trifle longer than average. With reasonable\nagility, considering his bulk, he hoisted himself into the saddle and\nset off toward the miniature palace awaiting him. His guardsmen\ntrotted alongside while the rest of his retinue mounted and followed\nas best they could.\n\nHe drew rein once, to gaze up through the dome at the yellow-green\ndisk of Jursa. Wilkins overtook him.\n\n\"Note the dark line in the southern hemisphere, Sire,\" he said. \"The\nresult of Marshal Tzyfol's sweep--the one that broke through their\nfleets and led to their plea for terms.\"\n\n\"Excellent!\" said the Emperor. He lowered his gaze and stretched his\nneck uncomfortably. Vyrtl was unaccustomed to looking up at anything\nor anybody. \"They will bear our mark.\"\n\n\"It will teach them the lesson they deserve,\" agreed Wilkins\ndutifully. \"Autonomy, indeed!\"\n\n\"Quite,\" said Vyrtl, urging his lozard forward. \"Who are those fools\nto think they can demand exemption from established imperial laws ...\nthey should be satisfied with the standard textbooks and forget their\nputtering! Ha--what's this?\"\n\nHe pulled up before a small replica of the palace.\n\n\"The dome engineer built it for your wives, Sire.\"\n\n\"Our wives?\"\n\n\"Twenty of them volunteered to share the rigors of the campaign. Their\nspecial transport arrived just before us.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" grunted Vyrtl, riding past.\n\n\n\nEarly the next morning, after the engineers had arranged a dawn for\nhis benefit, Vyrtl called a council of his commanders. Chief-of-Staff\nRobert Tzyfol reported on the situation.\n\nThe rebellious Jursans were sending a representative to ask for terms.\nIn the Marshal's strongly expressed opinion, no leniency was\nnecessary. The imperial fleets were slowly but surely stamping out all\nresistance, making Jursa unlivable.\n\n\"Abject submission is their only course,\" he declared.\n\nIt was the sort of declaration with which Vyrtl might have agreed, had\nhe been able to voice it first.\n\nAs it was, he announced that he would keep it in mind when judging the\nfate of the rebels. He had no inclination to destroy a perfectly good,\ntax-paying planet if he could whip its inhabitants into line by other\nmeans.\n\nHe ended the conference by stating his intention to ride in the\nartificial forest. He enjoyed the glances of relief among the\ngenerals--especially the older and more brittle ones--when he gave\nthem leave to resume their military duties instead of attending him.\n\nA few hours later, Wilkins found Vyrtl and a small retinue resting\nbeside a pool at the edge of the forest.\n\n\"The rebel envoy has arrived, Sire,\" he reported.\n\nVyrtl kicked a pebble into the pool and spat after it. \"We shall see\nhim immediately,\" he announced. \"No use wasting ceremony on the\nvillain.\"\n\nReturning to the palace, he strode into the audience chamber and\nsignaled for the envoy to be admitted. Still warm from his ride and\ninsultingly disheveled, he sat in the imitation of the great throne on\nhis capital planet, Hebryxid.\n\n\"If he isn't brisk,\" he muttered to Wilkins, \"we may teach him\npromptness by hunting him through the forest tomorrow.\"\n\nAbove the whispers of hastily assembled officers, courtiers, and a few\nof Vyrtl's wives, a chamberlain announced, \"The Jursan envoy, Daphne\nFoster.\"\n\n\"A woman?\" murmured Vyrtl.\n\n\"So it seems. She looks quite ... distinguished.\"\n\n\"Ha! The witty Wilkins! A pretty choice of words.\"\n\nThe woman approached the throne amid a low buzz from Vyrtl's\nattendants, and bowed gracefully. Gracefully but not too abjectly,\nconsidering the situation and his own position, Vyrtl thought. She\nraised her head and endured his deliberate scrutiny.\n\nShe _would_ have to be a rebel, Vyrtl told himself. He supposed they\nhad scoured all Jursa for a real beauty to dazzle him; but they would\ndiscover that it would not work.\n\nAt first glance, she had seemed slim, but he saw now that, though\ntall, she was very well proportioned. A net of tiny, glittering jewels\nwas woven into the black hair that hung to her shoulders. Her features\nwere regular, but expressively alive compared to the artificial\nplacidity of the court beauties.\n\nBut what disturbed the Emperor of Pollux most was the way she looked\nat him! He felt that it was stretching diplomacy a bit far.\n\nA smile in deep blue eyes was pleasant, when someone was sufficiently\naccomplished to muster it in his presence; but this was a shade too\nfamiliar. She seemed to put herself on a level with him--as if to\nshare an amusement beyond the others present.\n\nThe next moment, he was trying to decide just what quality made hers\nthe most beautiful female voice he had ever heard. Consequently, he\nmissed most of the formula about \"the gratitude of all Jursa\" at his\nreceiving \"his humble slave.\"\n\n\n\nThat smile lit the blue eyes again. It was hard to tell if a ghost of\nit lingered at the corners of the full lips, but the total effect was\nof anything but humility. He pulled himself together, aware that\nWilkins had noticed his hesitation.\n\n\"So the Jursans seek to soften our just anger?\" he said. \"They send\ntheir surrender by one who is obviously the loveliest jewel of their\nmisguided world.\"\n\nA few of the courtiers snickered dutifully. Vyrtl was annoyed; he had\nnot meant to be funny. He glanced swiftly at the half-dozen wives\npresent, but their expressions showed no jealousy. He decided that the\nempty-headed creatures had at least learned not to embarrass him\npublicly.\n\n\"Your Illustrious Sublimity is too gracious,\" replied the envoy. \"I\nregret that my message is not unqualified surrender.\"\n\nVyrtl frowned. \"You dare ask terms?\"\n\n\"I must carry out the commands laid upon me by the Council.\"\n\nShe smiled into his eyes and made a rueful little gesture with both\nhands, which she allowed to fall gracefully to her sides. Vyrtl's gaze\nwas led up and down her figure again.\n\nHe forced himself to meet her glance. Rather than expressing any\nresentment of his appraisal, it suggested that her resistance to his\ndemands would be merely formal.\n\n_They've sent me a clever one_, he thought, _but they will find I\ncannot be bought off so cheaply. Still, it can do no harm to show that\nVyrtl can be the diplomat as well as a soldier._\n\n\"We are unprepared for any discussion,\" he said aloud. \"Since we are\nnot disposed, however, to be hasty in our judgement, you may wait upon\nus in the council chamber in two hours.\"\n\nThe envoy stepped lithely aside when he rose. With some difficulty,\nVyrtl kept his eyes front as he strode from the hall with Wilkins and\nhis personal guards at his heels. He hastened to his own chambers for\na bath and change of clothes.\n\nHe allowed himself to be bathed, scented, and dressed in the most\nimperial costume he had brought from Hebryxid. Blonde Xota, his\nofficial favorite who had taken no chance of losing her place by\nabsence from his side, admired his dazzling jewels and scarlet silks\nextravagantly. Vyrtl permitted her to serve him a light lunch, paying\nlittle attention to her chatter.\n\nOnce, when he had taken her from the Co-ordinator of his sixth planet,\nhe had fancied himself in love with her; now he merely amused himself\nguessing from day to day to whom she sold her supposed influence. He\nsometimes wondered if any wife he owned were innocent of spying.\n\nHe rose, summoned Wilkins, and led a small procession to the council\nchamber. They found the necessary quota of high officers waiting.\nDaphne Foster was summoned.\n\nVyrtl took his place on a dais at the head of the table, and his aide\narranged the gold-stiffened ceremonial robe. The generals made little\nprofessional jokes, each striving to act as if the victory had been\nmostly his own doing. Even the lean Chief of Staff, Tzyfol, looked\nsatiated.\n\nThe Jursan envoy was announced.\n\n\n\nOnce again, Vyrtl was so fascinated by the girl that he paid scant\nheed to the ceremonious greetings. He decided she was younger than he\nhad thought earlier.\n\nFinally, the conference got down to business.\n\n\"My people,\" said Daphne Foster, \"ask but a few minor concessions,\nwhich we believe will benefit the remainder of the Empire as much as\nJursa.\"\n\n\"We are disposed to believe your good intentions,\" said Vyrtl\nencouragingly.\n\nHe caught himself smiling, and immediately resumed the mask of\ndignity.\n\nThe Jursans, it developed, would give up demands for autonomy and\nresume allegiance to the Empire. They pleaded, however, for freedom of\nscientific research, promising that their discoveries would be placed\npromptly at Vyrtl's disposal.\n\nIn the matter of indemnities, they were willing, Daphne Foster said\nwith an intimate glance for Vyrtl alone, to rely upon his generosity.\nThey asked only that they be allowed a reasonable time to restore the\ndamage suffered in the fighting and that they be permitted to make\npart of the payments in the technical equipment they were so skilled\nat manufacturing.\n\nSome of the officers raised objections that Vyrtl thought well-put,\nbut he overruled them. The main point, he pronounced, was to restore a\nvaluable possession to productivity. There would be no looting and\ndestruction.\n\nHe felt less sure of himself when old Tzyfol protested that free\nresearch was one of the roots of the trouble. Consequently, perhaps,\nthe imperial glare that silenced the Marshal was the more withering.\n\nAfter that, Vyrtl sat back and allowed his cohorts to promulgate a\nnumber of minor, harassing conditions. These would satisfy their egos\nto some degree, keep the Jursans aware of the folly of questioning his\nauthority again, and show their envoy how things might have gone had\nVyrtl not been merciful.\n\nIn the end, he added one condition of his own.\n\n\"It will be necessary,\" he said, \"to hold frequent conferences on\nthese affairs. If the Jursan Council should appoint their envoy as\npermanent ambassador to our court, we should be inclined to approve.\"\n\nIt was tantamount to a command, but the girl showed no resentment. Not\nthat Vyrtl expected anything so rash as outward reluctance--but a\nlifetime of piercing the flattery of courtiers had made him a shrewd\nreader of facial expressions.\n\nHe granted permission for an immediate broadcasting of the treaty,\noverriding Tzyfol's desire for deeper consideration in favor of Daphne\nFoster's plea that delay would cost lives.\n\nAfter having copies of the rather simple document drawn up for the\nfacsimile broadcasters, Vyrtl gave her leave to depart. Without\nseeming to watch, he admired her gait as she walked from the\nconference chamber.\n\n\n\nAfterwards, he left the generals to their post-mortem and retired with\nWilkins to a private balcony for a bottle of wine.\n\n\"How did it go?\" he asked, leaning back more comfortably when his aide\nhad removed the heavy robe.\n\n\"You were most generous, Sire, or so I thought.\"\n\n\"It is a virtue that requires a public display now and then, to\nstrengthen the roots of the myth that grows from it. Too bad old\nTzyfol failed to see that. Why do you suppose he tried to be\nobstinate?\"\n\n\"I expect, Sire, he disliked having an old woman seem to get the\nbetter of him after he had won the military victory.\"\n\nVyrtl laughed indulgently and sipped his wine.\n\n\"Even Tzyfol,\" added Wilkins, \"might have been generous had she been\nyoung and pretty. Unfortunately, I suppose, it takes an old head to be\nan envoy.\"\n\nThe Emperor set his glass down very carefully.\n\n\"What did you say?\" he demanded evenly.\n\nWilkins stared, with the expression of a man who fears he may suddenly\nrecall having used an obscene word in polite company, or having\nbragged falsely and unwittingly of tax-evasion to an imperial\ncollector.\n\nVyrtl repeated his question in a tone a note higher.\n\n\"I-I-I said that if she were young and p-pretty--\"\n\n\"How old do you think she was?\" rasped Vyrtl.\n\n\"About s-s-seventy. Maybe seventy-five.\"\n\n\"_What?_\"\n\nHe surged to his feet, overturning the table. Immediately the glass\ndoors opening on the balcony were flung back with a splintering crash.\n\nFour gleaming guardsmen charged out with drawn weapons, each obviously\naching to become a hero. Wilkins prudently stood rooted, peering at\nthem from the corner of his eye.\n\nVyrtl recovered his poise with an effort.\n\n\"As you were!\" he ordered. \"Help General Wilkins pick up the table I\nknocked over. Clumsy thing!\"\n\nIt was done, and the guard captain apologized for the doors.\n\n\"Relax, Wilkins,\" said Vyrtl when they were again alone. \"It just\noccurred to me that I ought to have another word with that woman. Have\nsomeone get hold of her at once!\"\n\nHe left the disordered balcony and waited in a nearby library. The\nbooks lining the walls were real, he noticed idly--another painstaking\npoint by the designer of the palace.\n\nThere Wilkins found him presently, to report that the Jursan envoy was\nalready on her way back to that planet.\n\n\"I called the landing field guard,\" he explained, \"but she had already\ntaken off. His spotters swept space for them and got a curve on the\nship.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" mused Vyrtl. \"The treaty has been broadcast.\"\n\n\"Shall I have the patrols close in on her rocket?\"\n\n\"No.\" The Emperor pondered a moment. \"Have a telescreen set up in here\nso we can speak directly.\"\n\nA frenzied bustle ensued as Wilkins directed a platoon of awed techs\nthrough the process of bringing the mountain to Mohammed. In the end,\nthe Jursan ship was in communication. The aide called for Daphne\nFoster, then stood aside.\n\nVyrtl was glad, when she appeared, that Wilkins had placed a deep\narmchair before the screen for him.\n\nWas _this_ the woman with whom he had--?\n\n\n\nShe was still tall, but her white hair gave her the look of the\nseventy years with which Wilkins had credited her. Deep laugh-wrinkles\nbracketed the mouth, with more at the corners of the still bright\neyes. The delicate bones of her face were more prominent.\n\nThere was nevertheless a clear resemblance to the Daphne Foster he had\nreceived earlier.\n\n_She looks ... she looked_, thought Vyrtl, _as this woman might have\nlooked when she was young ... or might have wanted to look._\n\nNo, that was not quite it.\n\n_As she knew a man would have liked her to look!_\n\nThe woman on the screen spoke, her eyes smiling into his in a manner\nthat was painfully familiar.\n\n\"Your Illustrious Sublimity has become the first to share my little\nsecret.\"\n\nVyrtl, with a concentration of will, prevented his eyes from peeping\nsidelong at Wilkins' expression.\n\n\"We are somewhat surprised,\" he said, knowing it for an asinine remark\nbut afraid to risk his dignity by being plainer.\n\n\"Of course,\" she said, \"I hardly expect it to make any difference in\nthe imperial announcement of peace, but if any clarification is\ndesired of me, I shall be happy to oblige.\"\n\nVyrtl thought furiously. Had he actually _said_ anything to Wilkins or\nanyone else? He tried to remember every word spoken at the conference.\nIt seemed to him there had been one or two slips, but they had been\ntaken for imperial witticisms.\n\nNo, he was safe enough. The Jursan Council and their technicians\nnaturally must know the \"clarification\" offered him, but they would\nknow better than to publicize it. He could afford to show no mercy if\nthey did. As things stood, it might be best to stand by his published\nword.\n\n\"We desire,\" he said slowly, \"that you, as ambassador, return\nimmediately. You will have every facility to communicate with your\ngovernment, to repay the inconvenience.\"\n\nThe old woman stared him in the eye, then bowed silently.\n\nVyrtl saw that she realized what it might mean. He hoped she would not\narrange an \"accident\" before her ship returned.\n\nHe had Wilkins take over and check with the captain of the rocket. It\nwas determined that the best effort would bring the ship back to the\ndome on Klo about \"mid-morning.\" Vyrtl left orders that the woman was\nto be brought before him the moment she arrived, and retired for the\nnight.\n\nHe found Xota sprawled confidently upon his bed, and kicked her off in\na temper. His groping had found no loose object to fling after her as\nshe slunk out the door, and that made his temper worse. He was a long\ntime getting to sleep....\n\n\n\nThe next morning, he pecked at his breakfast and sneered at the\nartificial dawn that had been delayed for his benefit.\n\n\"Get me a lozard and a squad of guards!\" he snarled to Wilkins. \"I'll\nhave a run through the woods while I wait.\"\n\nHe left the guards at the fringes of his engineers' forest and rode\nthe eight-legged reptile recklessly among the huge trunks. Since the\nbuilder had artfully omitted all low branches, there was little chance\nof his knocking his head off.\n\nTowards noon, he paused to rest at the little pool on the edge of the\nwoods. He waved to a group of guards he saw peering at him across an\nopen field of what looked very much like grass. One of the men ran\nover.\n\n\"The Jursan envoy is back, Your Illustrious Sublimity.\"\n\nVyrtl sighed.\n\n\"Tell General Wilkins to bring her here immediately.\"\n\nHe turned away and sat upon a flat stone beside the pool.\n\nAfter a while, he noticed that the ground was liberally supplied with\npebbles for casting into the water. He was watching the spreading\nripples about fifteen minutes later when he heard approaching voices\nbehind him.\n\nA glance over his shoulder showed him Wilkins and two guards escorting\nthe old woman. He turned away, tossing another pebble into the pool\nwith a half-hearted motion of his arm.\n\nWhen Wilkins coughed discreetly behind him, he told the aide and the\nguards to withdraw. He listened to the footsteps until he knew they\nwere beyond range of ordinary conversation.\n\n\"You are the same Daphne Foster?\" he asked, still facing the pool.\n\n\"The same, Your Illustrious Sublimity.\"\n\n\"Let us dispense with formality. Tell me how you did it.\"\n\n\"It is simple ... in a way. But it requires the use of a not-so-simple\ninstrument.\"\n\n\"Such as I?\" he asked, apparently intent upon the water.\n\n\"I did not mean Your Illustrious--I did not mean it that way. It is a\nlittle triumph of our Jursan technicians, which will shortly be at\nyour disposal. I used it to force an illusion upon you.\"\n\n\"And very cleverly, I admit. Do you have it with you?\"\n\n\"Yes. It is compact. It merely operates upon the idea that other\nforces can be used to produce hypnosis besides lights, drugs, and\nsoothing sounds.\"\n\n\"Turn it on!\" ordered Vyrtl.\n\n\n\nHe waited a moment, then twisted around on the stone to face her.\nThere was no sign of the woman he had seen crossing the field. Before\nhim seemed to stand the black-haired, lithe girl.\n\nThe only change was in her eyes, which no longer smiled into his so\nprovocatively.\n\n_Funny_, thought Vyrtl. _When we actually were strangers, she seemed\nso intimate. Only now does she look at me so coldly._\n\n\"You see?\" she said, and started to reach for some switch or button\nconcealed by the jewel at her breast.\n\nVyrtl stopped her with a gesture.\n\n\"You must also be skilled in the sciences of the mind,\" he remarked.\n\"What I mean is ... I suppose you never really looked like that?\"\n\nShe shook her head a trifle ruefully.\n\n\"Not quite. Most of it is in your own imagination. We know a good deal\nabout you, Your--\"\n\n\"You deduced somehow what I would look for,\" interrupted Vyrtl,\nnodding. \"I can see how a study of the things I chose to have about\nme--paintings, statues, furnishings, even people--might yield keys to\nmy preferences. You did remarkably well.\"\n\nHe tossed another pebble and stared at the ripples.\n\n\"I suppose every man has his ideal of a woman,\" he said. \"I doubt that\nany man has _seen_ his absolute ideal--except me. I wonder if you know\nwhat it does to one?\"\n\nHe chose a flat pebble and sent it skipping across the surface with a\nvicious snap of his wrist. It bounced three ... four ... five times,\nand sank.\n\n\"I presume,\" said Daphne Foster, breaking a tight little silence,\n\"that you will grant me time to set my affairs in order?\"\n\nVyrtl weighed a pebble in his hand.\n\n\"You expect to be executed,\" he stated flatly.\n\n\"Naturally, we knew all along that someone would have to pay for\ntricking you. The Emperor of Pollux must, after all, maintain his\ndignity.\"\n\nVyrtl wondered if he had detected a note of irony in the musical\nvoice. He marveled anew at the pleasure of listening to her. But of\ncourse, he reminded himself, he heard his own imagined ideal of what a\nlovely woman's voice should be.\n\n\"No,\" he said abruptly, swinging about. \"I am merely going to insist\nthat you fulfill the terms of the agreement by remaining at my court.\nI want you near me from now on.\"\n\nShe blinked at that.\n\n\"But, surely ... you must realize ... it is only an illusion!\" she\nprotested.\n\n\"As am I,\" said Vyrtl. \"A figurehead imprisoned in a maze of\nformalities and so-called pleasures.\"\n\n\n\nHe saw that she could not understand what could be wrong with his\nposition.\n\n\"Once, when I was very young,\" he said, \"I thought I would rule. But\nfourteen planets require a whole _council_ of co-ordinators! I gave up\nthat idea and tried to enjoy myself.\"\n\nShe stared at him uncertainly. He waved a hand at the artificial\nforest.\n\n\"It has been like that ever since. They fall all over themselves to\ndevise new ways of getting my attention and to present pleasures and\nentertainment I am incapable of enjoying. I have more wealth than I\ncan estimate, I sometimes forget which palace I am in, even my wives\nlook alike by now.\"\n\n\"I must sympathize with Your Illustrious Sublimity.\"\n\nHe flung her a hard stare.\n\n\"Perhaps you ought! Even my generals and their soldiers have their\ndreams--of conquest or loot. The engineer who built this dome pictures\nhimself famous and admired. Wilkins is proud of his influence, and\nother courtiers have visions of doing away with Wilkins and replacing\nhim.\"\n\nHe stood up restlessly.\n\n\"You will laugh at me, I know--but there is little enjoyment in life\nwhen every whim is catered to at a snap of one's fingers. What have I\nto _desire_?\"\n\n\"I see.\" She nodded slowly. \"The old saying about the pleasure of\nanticipation outweighing that of attainment.\"\n\n\"You should know. You Jursans and your scientific renaissance, your\ngoal of contacting Terra again.\"\n\nHe beckoned to Wilkins and the two guards. They ran eagerly across the\ngrass.\n\n\"You see?\" he snorted. \"Sometimes I almost wish they would ignore me!\"\n\nHe looked at her and saw the blue eyes achieve their knowing, amused\nsmile once more.\n\n\"That's right,\" he said, smiling back. \"Now I shall have something to\nkeep my thoughts from becoming dull and bored. A man needs some\nimpossible dream for moments when he wants to relax.\"\n\nWilkins panted up, trying to look alert and willing.\n\n\"The unattainable Lady Daphne will accompany us to our capital,\" said\nVyrtl. \"Make the necessary arrangements.\"\n\nHe enjoyed the way his aide covered up a momentary bewilderment.\n\n_No one else will ever, ever understand this_, he thought with an\nunaccustomed thrill of pleasure and amusement.\n\n",
