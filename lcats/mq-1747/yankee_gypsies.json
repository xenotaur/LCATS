    "body": "by John Greenleaf Whittier\n\n\n\n\n     \"Here's to budgets, packs, and wallets;\n     Here's to all the wandering train.\"\n     BURNS.(1)\n\n\n\nI CONFESS it, I am keenly sensitive to \"skyey influences.\" (2) I profess\nno indifference to the movements of that capricious old gentleman\nknown as the clerk of the weather. I cannot conceal my interest in the\nbehavior of that patriarchal bird whose wooden similitude gyrates on the\nchurch spire. Winter proper is well enough. Let the thermometer go\nto zero if it will; so much the better, if thereby the very winds are\nfrozen and unable to flap their stiff wings. Sounds of bells in the keen\nair, clear, musical, heart-inspiring; quick tripping of fair moccasined\nfeet on glittering ice pavements; bright eyes glancing above the\nuplifted muff like a sultana's behind the folds of her _yashmak;_(3)\nschoolboys coasting down street like mad Greenlanders; the cold\nbrilliance of oblique sunbeams flashing back from wide surfaces of\nglittering snow, or blazing upon ice jewelry of tree and roof: there is\nnothing in all this to complain of. A storm of summer has its redeeming\nsublimities,--its slow, upheaving mountains of cloud glooming in the\nwestern horizon like new-created volcanoes, veined with fire, shattered\nby exploding thunders. Even the wild gales of the equinox have their\nvarieties,--sounds of wind-shaken woods and waters, creak and clatter\nof sign and casement, hurricane puffs, and down-rushing rain-spouts. But\nthis dull, dark autumn day of thaw and rain, when the very clouds seem\ntoo spiritless and languid to storm outright or take themselves out of\nthe way of fair weather; wet beneath and above, reminding one of\nthat rayless atmosphere of Dante's Third Circle, where the infernal\nPriessnitz(4) administers his hydropathic torment,--\n\n     \"A heavy, cursed, and relentless drench,--\n     The land it soaks is putrid;\"\n\nor rather, as everything animate and inanimate is seething in warm mist,\nsuggesting the idea that Nature, grown old and rheumatic, is trying the\nefficacy of a Thomsonian steam-box(5) on a grand scale; no sounds\nsave the heavy plash of muddy feet on the pavements; the monotonous,\nmelancholy drip from trees and roofs; the distressful gurgling of\nwaterducts, swallowing the dirty amalgam of the gutters; a dim,\nleaden-colored horizon of only a few yards in diameter, shutting down\nabout one, beyond which nothing is visible save in faint line or\ndark projection; the ghost of a church spire or the eidolon of a\nchimney-pot,--he who can extract pleasurable emotions from the\nalembic of such a day has a trick of alchemy with which I am wholly\nunacquainted.\n\n     (1) From the closing air in _The Jolly Beggars,_ a cantata.\n     (2)                             \"A breath thou art\n           Servile to all the skyey influences,\n           That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st\n           Hourly afflict.\"\n               Shakespeare: _Measure for Measure,_ act III. scene 1.\n     (3) \"She turns and turns again, and carefully glances around\n     her on all sides, to see that she is safe from the eyes of\n     Mussulmans, and then suddenly withdrawing the yashmak she\n     shines upon your heart and soul with all the pomp and might of\n     her beauty.\" Kinglake's _Eothen,_ chap. iii.  In a note to\n     _Yashmak_ Kinglake explains that it is not a mere\n     semi-transparent veil, but thoroughly conceals all the features\n     except the eyes: it is withdrawn by being pulled down.\n     (4) Vincenz Priessnitz was the originator of the water-cure.\n     After experimenting upon himself and his neighbors he took up\n     the profession of hydropathy and established baths at his native\n     place, Grafenberg in Silesia, in 1829.  He died in 1851.\n     (5) Dr. Samuel Thomson, a New Hampshire physician,\n     advocated the use of the steam bath as a restorer of system\n     when diseased.  He died in 1843 and left behind an\n     autobiography (_Life and Medical Discoveries_) which\n     contains a record of the persecutions he underwent.\n\nHark! a rap at my door. Welcome anybody just now. One gains nothing by\nattempting to shut out the sprites of the weather. They come in at the\nkeyhole; they peer through the dripping panes; they insinuate themselves\nthrough the crevices of the casement, or plump down chimney astride of\nthe raindrops.\n\nI rise and throw open the door. A tall, shambling, loose-jointed figure;\na pinched, shrewd face, sun-brown and wind-dried; small, quick-winking\nblack eyes,--there he stands, the water dripping from his pulpy hat and\nragged elbows.\n\nI speak to him; but he returns no answer. With a dumb show of misery,\nquite touching, he hands me a soiled piece of parchment, whereon I read\nwhat purports to be a melancholy account of shipwreck and disaster, to\nthe particular detriment, loss, and damnification of one Pietro Frugoni,\nwho is, in consequence, sorely in want of the alms of all charitable\nChristian persons, and who is, in short, the bearer of this veracious\ndocument, duly certified and indorsed by an Italian consul in one of\nour Atlantic cities, of a high-sounding, but to Yankee organs\nunpronounceable, name.\n\nHere commences a struggle. Every man, the Mahometans tell us, has two\nattendant angels,--the good one on his right shoulder, the bad on his\nleft. \"Give,\" says Benevolence, as with some difficulty I fish up a\nsmall coin from the depths of my pocket. \"Not a cent,\" says selfish\nPrudence; and I drop it from my fingers. \"Think,\" says the good angel,\n\"of the poor stranger in a strange land, just escaped from the terrors\nof the sea-storm, in which his little property has perished, thrown\nhalf-naked and helpless on our shores, ignorant of our language, and\nunable to find employment suited to his capacity.\" \"A vile impostor!\"\nreplies the left-hand sentinel; \"his paper purchased from one of those\nready-writers in New York who manufacture beggar-credentials at the low\nprice of one dollar per copy, with earthquakes, fires, or shipwrecks, to\nsuit customers.\"\n\nAmidst this confusion of tongues I take another survey of my visitant.\nHa! a light dawns upon me. That shrewd, old face, with its sharp,\nwinking eyes, is no stranger to me. Pietro Frugoni, I have seen thee\nbefore. _Si, signor,_ that face of thine has looked at me over a dirty\nwhite neckcloth, with the corners of that cunning mouth drawn downwards,\nand those small eyes turned up in sanctimonious gravity, while thou wast\noffering to a crowd of half-grown boys an extemporaneous exhortation in\nthe capacity of a travelling preacher. Have I not seen it peering out\nfrom under a blanket, as that of a poor Penobscot Indian, who had lost\nthe use of his hands while trapping on the Madawaska? Is it not the face\nof the forlorn father of six small children, whom the \"marcury doctors\"\nhad \"pisened\" and crippled? Did it not belong to that down-east\nunfortunate who had been out to the \"Genesee country\"(1) and got the\n\"fevernnager,\" and whose hand shook so pitifully when held out to\nreceive my poor gift? The same, under all disguises,--Stephen Leathers,\nof Barrington,--him, and none other! Let me conjure him into his own\nlikeness:--\n\n(1) The _Genesee country_ is the name by which the western part of New\nYork, bordering on Lakes Ontario and Erie, was known, when, at the\nclose of the last and beginning of this century, it was to people on\nthe Atlantic coast the Great West. In 1792 communication was opened by\na road with the Pennsylvania settlements, but the early settlers were\nalmost all from New England.\n\n\"Well, Stephen, what news from old Barrington?\"\n\n\"Oh, well, I thought I knew ye,\" he answers, not the least disconcerted.\n\"How do you do? and how's your folks? All well, I hope. I took this\n'ere paper, you see, to help a poor furriner, who could n't make himself\nunderstood any more than a wild goose. I though I'd just start him\nfor'ard a little. It seemed a marcy to do it.\"\n\nWell and shiftily answered, thou ragged Proteus. One cannot be angry\nwith such a fellow. I will just inquire into the present state of his\nGospel mission and about the condition of his tribe on the Penobscot;\nand it may be not amiss to congratulate him on the success of the\nsteam-doctors in sweating the \"pisen\" of the regular faculty out of him.\nBut he evidently has no wish to enter into idle conversation. Intent\nupon his benevolent errand he is already clattering down stairs.\nInvoluntarily I glance out of the window just in season to catch a\nsingle glimpse of him ere he is swallowed up in the mist.\n\nHe has gone; and, knave as he is, I can hardly help exclaiming, \"Luck\ngo with him!\" He has broken in upon the sombre train of my thoughts\nand called up before me pleasant and grateful recollections. The old\nfarm-house nestling in its valley; hills stretching off to the south and\ngreen meadows to the east; the small stream which came noisily down its\nravine, washing the old garden-wall and softly lapping on fallen stones\nand mossy roots of beeches and hemlocks; the tall sentinel poplars at\nthe gateway; the oak-forest, sweeping unbroken to the northern horizon;\nthe grass-grown carriage-path, with its rude and crazy bridge,--the\ndear old landscape of my boyhood lies outstretched before me like a\ndaguerreotype from that picture within, which I have borne with me in\nall my wanderings. I am a boy again, once more conscious of the feeling,\nhalf terror, half exultation, with which I used to announce the approach\nof this very vagabond and his \"kindred after the flesh.\"\n\nThe advent of wandering beggars, or \"old stragglers,\" as we were wont\nto call them, was an event of no ordinary interest in the generally\nmonotonous quietude of our farm-life. Many of them were well known; they\nhad their periodical revolutions and transits; we would calculate them\nlike eclipses or new moons. Some were sturdy knaves, fat and saucy; and,\nwhenever they ascertained that the \"men folks\" were absent, would order\nprovisions and cider like men who expected to pay for them, seating\nthemselves at the hearth or table with the air of Falstaff,--\"Shall\nI not take mine ease in mine inn?\" Others, poor, pale, patient, like\nSterne's monk,(1) came creeping up to the door, hat in hand, standing\nthere in their gray wretchedness with a look of heartbreak and\nforlornness which was never without its effect on our juvenile\nsensibilities. At times, however, we experienced a slight revulsion of\nfeeling when even these humblest children of sorrow somewhat petulantly\nrejected our proffered bread and cheese, and demanded instead a glass of\ncider. Whatever the temperance society might in such cases have done,\nit was not in our hearts to refuse the poor creatures a draught of\ntheir favorite beverage; and was n't it a satisfaction to see their sad,\nmelancholy faces light up as we handed them the full pitcher, and, on\nreceiving it back empty from their brown, wrinkled hands, to hear them,\nhalf breathless from their long, delicious draught, thanking us for the\nfavor, as \"dear, good children\"! Not unfrequently these wandering tests\nof our benevolence made their appearance in interesting groups of man,\nwoman, and child, picturesque in their squalidness, and manifesting\na maudlin affection which would have done honor to the revellers at\nPoosie-Nansie's, immortal in the cantata of Burns. (2) I remember some\nwho were evidently the victims of monomania,--haunted and hunted by some\ndark thought,--possessed by a fixed idea. One, a black-eyed, wild-haired\nwoman, with a whole tragedy of sin, shame, and suffering written in her\ncountenance, used often to visit us, warm herself by our winter fire,\nand supply herself with a stock of cakes and cold meat; but was never\nknown to answer a question or to ask one. She never smiled; the cold,\nstony look of her eye never changed; a silent, impassive face, frozen\nrigid by some great wrong or sin. We used to look with awe upon the\n\"still woman,\" and think of the demoniac of Scripture who had a \"dumb\nspirit.\"\n\n     (1) Whom he met at Calais, as described in his _Sentimental\n     Journey._\n     (2) The _cantata_ is _The Jolly Beggars,_ from which the\n     motto heading this sketch was taken.  _Poosie-Nansie_ was the\n     keeper of a tavern in Mauchline, which was the favorite resort\n     of the lame sailors, maimed soldiers, travelling ballad-singers,\n     and all such loose companions as hang about the skirts of\n     society.  The cantata has for its theme the rivalry of a \"pigmy\n     scraper with his fiddle\" and a strolling tinker for a beggar\n     woman: hence the _maudlin affection._\n\nOne--I think I see him now, grim, gaunt, and ghastly, working his slow\nway up to our door--used to gather herbs by the wayside and called\nhimself doctor. He was bearded like a he-goat, and used to counterfeit\nlameness; yet, when he supposed himself alone, would travel on lustily,\nas if walking for a wager. At length, as if in punishment of his deceit,\nhe met with an accident in his rambles and became lame in earnest,\nhobbling ever after with difficulty on his gnarled crutches. Another\nused to go stooping, like Bunyan's pilgrim, under a pack made of an old\nbed-sacking, stuffed out into most plethoric dimensions, tottering on\na pair of small, meagre legs, and peering out with his wild, hairy face\nfrom under his burden like a big-bodied spider. That \"man with the pack\"\nalways inspired me with awe and reverence. Huge, almost sublime, in its\ntense rotundity, the father of all packs, never laid aside and never\nopened, what might there not be within it? With what flesh-creeping\ncuriosity I used to walk round about it at a safe distance, half\nexpecting to see its striped covering stirred by the motions of a\nmysterious life, or that some evil monsters would leap out of it, like\nrobbers from Ali Baba's jars or armed men from the Trojan horse!\n\nThere was another class of peripatetic philosophers--half pedler, half\nmendicant--who were in the habit of visiting us. One we recollect, a\nlame, unshaven, sinister-eyed, unwholesome fellow, with his basket of\nold newspapers and pamphlets, and his tattered blue umbrella, serving\nrather as a walking-staff than as a protection from the rain. He told\nus on one occasion, in answer to our inquiring into the cause of his\nlameness, that when a young man he was employed on the farm of the chief\nmagistrate of a neighboring State; where, as his ill luck would have it,\nthe governor's handsome daughter fell in love with him. He was caught\none day in the young lady's room by her father; whereupon the irascible\nold gentleman pitched him unceremoniously out of the window, laming\nhim for life, on a brick pavement below, like Vulcan on the rocks of\nLemnos.(1) As for the lady, he assured us \"she took on dreadfully about\nit.\" \"Did she die?\" we inquired, anxiously. There was a cunning twinkle\nin the old rogue's eye as he responded, \"Well, no she did n't. She got\nmarried.\"\n\n     (1) It was upon the Isle of Lemnos that Vulcan was flung by\n     Jupiter, according to the myth, for attempting to aid his mother\n     Juno.\n\nTwice a year, usually in the spring and autumn, we were honored with a\ncall from Jonathan Plummer, maker of verses, pedler and poet, physician\nand parson,--a Yankee troubadour,--first and last minstrel of the valley\nof the Merrimac, encircled, to my wondering young eyes, with the very\nnimbus of immortality. He brought with him pins, needles, tape, and\ncotton-thread for my mother; jack-knives, razors, and soap for\nmy father; and verses of his own composing, coarsely printed and\nillustrated with rude wood-cuts, for the delectation of the younger\nbranches of the family. No love-sick youth could drown himself, no\ndeserted maiden bewail the moon, no rogue mount the gallows, without\nfitting memorial in Plummer's verses. Earthquakes, fires, fevers, and\nshipwrecks he regarded as personal favors from Providence, furnishing\nthe raw material of song and ballad. Welcome to us in our country\nseclusion, as Autolycus to the clown in \"Winter's Tale,\"(1) we listened\nwith infinite satisfaction to his reading of his own verses, or to his\nready improvisation upon some domestic incident or topic suggested by\nhis auditors. When once fairly over the difficulties at the outset of a\nnew subject his rhymes flowed freely, \"as if he had eaten ballads, and\nall men's ears grew to his tunes.\" His productions answered, as\nnearly as I can remember, to Shakespeare's description of a proper\nballad,--\"doleful matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant theme\nsung lamentably.\" He was scrupulously conscientious, devout, inclined\nto theological disquisitions, and withal mighty in Scripture. He was\nthoroughly independent; flattered nobody, cared for nobody, trusted\nnobody. When invited to sit down at our dinner-table he invariably took\nthe precaution to place his basket of valuables between his legs for\nsafe keeping. \"Never mind they basket, Jonathan,\" said my father;\n\"we shan't steal thy verses.\" \"I 'm not sure of that,\" returned the\nsuspicious guest. \"It is written, 'Trust ye not in any brother.'\"\n\n     (1) \"He could never come better,\" says the clown in\n     Shakespeare's _The Winter's Tale,_ when Autolycus, the\n     pedler, is announced; \"he shall come in.  I love a ballad but\n     even too well, if it be doleful matter merrily set down, or a very\n     pleasant thing indeed and sung lamentably.\"  Act IV. scene 4.\n\nThou, too, O Parson B.,--with thy pale student's brow and rubicund\nnose, with thy rusty and tattered black coat overswept by white, flowing\nlocks, with thy professional white neckcloth scrupulously preserved\nwhen even a shirt to thy back was problematical,--art by no means to\nbe overlooked in the muster-roll of vagrant gentlemen possessing the\n_entree_ of our farmhouse. Well do we remember with what grave and\ndignified courtesy he used to step over its threshold, saluting its\ninmates with the same air of gracious condescension and patronage with\nwhich in better days he had delighted the hearts of his parishioners.\nPoor old man! He had once been the admired and almost worshipped\nminister of the largest church in the town where he afterwards found\nsupport in the winter season, as a pauper. He had early fallen into\nintemperate habits; and at the age of three-score and ten, when I\nremember him, he was only sober when he lacked the means of being\notherwise. Drunk or sober, however, he never altogether forgot the\nproprieties of his profession; he was always grave, decorous, and\ngentlemanly; he held fast the form of sound words, and the weakness of\nthe flesh abated nothing of the rigor of his stringent theology. He had\nbeen a favorite pupil of the learned and astute Emmons,(1) and was to\nthe last a sturdy defender of the peculiar dogmas of his school.\nThe last time we saw him he was holding a meeting in our district\nschool-house, with a vagabond pedler for deacon and travelling\ncompanion. The tie which united the ill-assorted couple was doubtless\nthe same which endeared Tam O'Shanter to the souter:(2)--\n\n   \"They had been fou for weeks thegither.\"\n\nHe took for his text the first seven verses of the concluding chapter of\nEcclesiastes, furnishing in himself its fitting illustration. The evil\ndays had come; the keepers of the house trembled; the windows of life\nwere darkened. A few months later the silver cord was loosed, the golden\nbowl was broken, and between the poor old man and the temptations which\nbeset him fell the thick curtains of the grave.\n\n\n     (1) Nathaniel Emmons was a New England theologian of\n     marked character and power, who for seventy years was\n     connected with a church in that part of Wrentham, Mass., now\n     called Franklin.  He exercised considerable influence over the\n     religious thought of New England, and is still read by\n     theologians.  He died in 1840, in his ninety-sixth year.\n     (2) Souter (or cobbler) Johnny, in Burns's poetic tale of _Tam\n     O'Shanter,_ had been _fou_ or _full_ of drink with Tam for\n     weeks together.\n\nOne day we had a call from a \"pawky auld carle\"(1) of a wandering\nScotchman. To him I owe my first introduction to the songs of Burns.\nAfter eating his bread and cheese and drinking his mug of cider he gave\nus Bonny Doon, Highland Mary, and Auld Lang Syne. He had a rich, full\nvoice, and entered heartily into the spirit of his lyrics. I have since\nlistened to the same melodies from the lips of Dempster(2) (than whom\nthe Scottish bard has had no sweeter or truer interpreter), but\nthe skilful performance of the artist lacked the novel charm of the\ngaberlunzie's singing in the old farmhouse kitchen. Another wanderer\nmade us acquainted with the humorous old ballad of \"Our gude man cam\nhame at e'en.\" He applied for supper and lodging, and the next morning\nwas set at work splitting stones in the pasture. While thus engaged\nthe village doctor came riding along the highway on his fine, spirited\nhorse, and stopped to talk with my father. The fellow eyed the animal\nattentively, as if familiar with all his good points, and hummed over a\nstanza of the old poem:--\n\n  \"Our gude man cam hame at e'en,\n     And hame cam he;\n  And there he saw a saddle horse\n     Where nae horse should be.\n  'How cam this horse here?\n     How can it be?\n  How cam this horse here\n     Without the leave of me?'\n  'A horse?' quo she.\n  'Ay, a horse,' quo he.\n  'Ye auld fool, ye blind fool,--\n  And blinder might ye be,--\n  'T is naething but a milking cow\n     My mamma sent to me.'\n  'A milch cow?' quo he.\n  'Ay, a milch cow,' quo she.\n  'Weel, far hae I ridden,\n     And muckle hae I seen;\n  But milking cows wi' saddles on\n     Saw I never nane.'\"(3)\n\n     (1) From the first line of _The Gaberlunzie Man,_ attributed\n     to King James V. of Scotland,--\n\n         \"The pawky auld carle came o'er the lee.\"\n\n     The original like Whittier's was a sly old fellow, as an English\n     phrase would translate the Scottish.  _The Gaberlunzie Man_ is\n     given in Percy's _Reliques of Ancient Poetry_ and in Child's\n     _English and Scottish Ballads,_ viii. 98.\n     (2) William R. Dempster, a Scottish vocalist who had\n     recently sung in America, and whose music to Burns's song \"A\n     man 's a man for a' that\" was very popular.\n     (3) The whole of this song may be found in Herd's _Ancient\n     and Modern Scottish Songs,_ ii. 172.\n\nThat very night the rascal decamped, taking with him the doctor's horse,\nand was never after heard of.\n\nOften, in the gray of the morning, we used to see one or more\n\"gaberlunzie men,\" pack on shoulder and staff in hand, emerging from the\nbarn or other outbuildings where they had passed the night. I was once\nsent to the barn to fodder the cattle late in the evening, and, climbing\ninto the mow to pitch down hay for that purpose, I was startled by the\nsudden apparition of a man rising up before me, just discernible in the\ndim moonlight streaming through the seams of the boards. I made a rapid\nretreat down the ladder; and was only reassured by hearing the object\nof my terror calling after me, and recognizing his voice as that of a\nharmless old pilgrim whom I had known before. Our farmhouse was situated\nin a lonely valley, half surrounded with woods, with no neighbors in\nsight. One dark, cloudy night, when our parents chanced to be absent,\nwe were sitting with our aged grandmother in the fading light of the\nkitchen fire, working ourselves into a very satisfactory state of\nexcitement and terror by recounting to each other all the dismal stories\nwe could remember of ghosts, witches, haunted houses, and robbers, when\nwe were suddenly startled by a loud rap at the door. A strippling of\nfourteen, I was very naturally regarded as the head of the household;\nso, with many misgivings, I advanced to the door, which I slowly opened,\nholding the candle tremulously above my head and peering out into the\ndarkness. The feeble glimmer played upon the apparition of a\ngigantic horseman, mounted on a steed of a size worthy of such a\nrider,--colossal, motionless, like images cut out of the solid night.\nThe strange visitant gruffly saluted me; and, after making several\nineffectual efforts to urge his horse in at the door, dismounted and\nfollowed me into the room, evidently enjoying the terror which his huge\npresence excited. Announcing himself as the great Indian doctor, he\ndrew himself up before the fire, stretched his arms, clinched his fists,\nstruck his broad chest, and invited our attention to what he called\nhis \"mortal frame.\" He demanded in succession all kinds of intoxicating\nliquors; and on being assured that we had none to give him, he grew\nangry, threatened to swallow my younger brother alive, and, seizing me\nby the hair of my head as the angel did the prophet at Babylon,(1) led\nme about from room to room. After an ineffectual search, in the course\nof which he mistook a jug of oil for one of brandy, and, contrary to my\nexplanations and remonstrances, insisted upon swallowing a portion of\nits contents, he released me, fell to crying and sobbing, and confessed\nthat he was so drunk already that his horse was ashamed of him. After\nbemoaning and pitying himself to his satisfaction he wiped his eyes, and\nsat down by the side of my grandmother, giving her to understand that he\nwas very much pleased with her appearance; adding that, if agreeable to\nher, he should like the privilege of paying his addresses to her. While\nvainly endeavoring to make the excellent old lady comprehend his very\nflattering proposition, he was interrupted by the return of my father,\nwho, at once understanding the matter, turned him out of doors without\nceremony.\n\n     (1) See Ezekiel viii. 3.\n\nOn one occasion, a few years ago, on my return from the field at\nevening, I was told that a foreigner had asked for lodgings during the\nnight, but that, influenced by his dark, repulsive appearance, my\nmother had very reluctantly refused his request. I found her by no means\nsatisfied with her decision. \"What if a son of mine was in a strange\nland?\" she inquired, self-reproachfully. Greatly to her relief, I\nvolunteered to go in pursuit of the wanderer, and, taking a cross-path\nover the fields, soon overtook him. He had just been rejected at the\nhouse of our nearest neighbor, and was standing in a state of dubious\nperplexity in the street. He was an olive-complexioned, black-bearded\nItalian, with an eye like a live coal, such a face as perchance looks\nout on the traveller in the passes of the Abruzzi,(1)--one of those\nbandit visages which Salvator(2) has painted. With some difficulty I\ngave him to understand my errand, when he overwhelmed me with thanks,\nand joyfully followed me back. He took his seat with us at the\nsupper-table; and, when we were all gathered around the hearth that cold\nautumnal evening, he told us, partly by words and partly by gestures,\nthe story of his life and misfortunes, amused us with descriptions of\nthe grape-gatherings and festivals of his sunny clime, edified my mother\nwith a recipe for making bread of chestnuts; and in the morning, when,\nafter breakfast, his dark sullen face lighted up and his fierce eye\nmoistened with grateful emotion as in his own silvery Tuscan accent he\npoured out his thanks, we marvelled at the fears which had so nearly\nclosed our door against him; and, as he departed, we all felt that he\nhad left with us the blessing of the poor.\n\n     (1) Provinces into which the old Kingdom of Naples was\n     divided.\n     (2) Salvator Rosa was a Neapolitan by birth, and was said to\n     have been himself a bandit in his youth; his landscapes often\n     contain figures drawn from the wild life of the region.\n\nIt was not often that, as in the above instance, my mother's prudence\ngot the better of her charity. The regular \"old stragglers\" regarded her\nas an unfailing friend; and the sight of her plain cap was to them an\nassurance of forthcoming creature-comforts. There was indeed a tribe\nof lazy strollers, having their place of rendezvous in the town of\nBarrington, New Hampshire, whose low vices had placed them beyond even\nthe pale of her benevolence. They were not unconscious of their evil\nreputation; and experience had taught them the necessity of concealing,\nunder well-contrived disguises, their true character. They came to us\nin all shapes and with all appearances save the true one, with most\nmiserable stories of mishap and sickness and all \"the ills which flesh\nis heir to.\" It was particularly vexatious to discover, when too late,\nthat our sympathies and charities had been expended upon such graceless\nvagabonds as the \"Barrington beggars.\" An old withered hag, known by the\nappellation of Hopping Pat,--the wise woman of her tribe,--was in the\nhabit of visiting us, with her hopeful grandson, who had \"a gift for\npreaching\" as well as for many other things not exactly compatible\nwith holy orders. He sometimes brought with him a tame crow, a shrewd,\nknavish-looking bird, who, when in the humor for it, could talk like\nBarnaby Rudge's raven. He used to say he could \"do nothin' at exhortin'\nwithout a white handkercher on his neck and money in his pocket,\"--a\nfact going far to confirm the opinions of the Bishop of Exeter and the\nPuseyites generally, that there can be no priest without tithes and\nsurplice.\n\nThese people have for several generations lived distinct from the great\nmass of the community, like the gypsies of Europe, whom in many respects\nthey closely resemble. They have the same settled aversion to labor and\nthe same disposition to avail themselves of the fruits of the industry\nof others. They love a wild, out-of-door life, sing songs, tell\nfortunes, and have an instinctive hatred of \"missionaries and cold\nwater.\" It has been said--I know not upon what grounds--that their\nancestors were indeed a veritable importation of English gypsyhood; but\nif so, they have undoubtedly lost a good deal of the picturesque charm\nof its unhoused and free condition. I very much fear that my friend\nMary Russell Mitford,--sweetest of England's rural painters,--who has a\npoet's eye for the fine points in gypsy character, would scarcely\nallow their claims to fraternity with her own vagrant friends, whose\ncamp-fires welcomed her to her new home at Swallowfield.(1)\n\n     (1) See in Miss Mitford's _Our Village._\n\n\"The proper study of mankind is man;\" and, according to my view, no\nphase of our common humanity is altogether unworthy of investigation.\nActing upon this belief two or three summers ago, when making, in\ncompany with my sister, a little excursion into the hill-country of New\nHampshire, I turned my horse's head towards Barrington for the purpose\nof seeing these semi-civilized strollers in their own home, and\nreturning, once for all, their numerous visits. Taking leave of our\nhospitable cousins in old Lee with about as much solemnity as we may\nsuppose Major Laing(1) parted with his friends when he set out in search\nof desert-girdled Timbuctoo, we drove several miles over a rough road,\npassed the Devil's Den unmolested, crossed a fretful little streamlet\nnoisily working its way into a valley, where it turned a lonely,\nhalf-ruinous mill, and, climbing a steep hill beyond, saw before us a\nwide, sandy level, skirted on the west and north by low, scraggy hills,\nand dotted here and there with dwarf pitch-pines. In the centre of this\ndesolate region were some twenty or thirty small dwellings, grouped\ntogether as irregularly as a Hottentot kraal. Unfenced, unguarded, open\nto all comers and goers, stood that city of the beggars,--no wall\nor paling between the ragged cabins to remind one of the jealous\ndistinctions of property. The great idea of its founders seemed visible\nin its unappropriated freedom. Was not the whole round world their own?\nand should they haggle about boundaries and title-deeds? For them, on\ndistant plains, ripened golden harvests; for them, in far-off workshops,\nbusy hands were toiling; for them, if they had but the grace to note it,\nthe broad earth put on her garniture of beauty, and over them hung the\nsilent mystery of heaven and its stars. That comfortable philosophy\nwhich modern transcendentalism has but dimly shadowed forth--that poetic\nagrarianism, which gives all to each and each to all--is the real life\nof this city of unwork. To each of its dingy dwellers might be not\nunaptly applied the language of one who, I trust, will pardon me for\nquoting her beautiful poem in this connection:--\n\n  \"Other hands may grasp the field and forest,\n  Proud proprietors in pomp may shine,\n .    .    .    .    .     .     .\n  Thou art wealthier,--all the world is thine.\"(2)\n\n     (1) Alexander Gordon Laing was a major in the British army,\n     who served on the west coast of Africa and made journeys into\n     the interior in the attempt to establish commercial relations\n     with the natives, and especially to discover the sources of the\n     Niger.  He was treacherously murdered in 1826 by the guard\n     that was attending him on his return from Timbuctoo to the\n     coast.  His travels excited great interest in their day in England\n     and America.\n     (2) From a poem, _Why Thus Longing?_ by Mrs. Harriet\n     Winslow Sewall, preserved in Whittier's _Songs of Three\n     Centuries._\n\nBut look! the clouds are breaking. \"Fair weather cometh out of the\nnorth.\" The wind has blown away the mists; on the gilded spire of John\nStreet glimmers a beam of sunshine; and there is the sky again, hard,\nblue, and cold in its eternal purity, not a whit the worse for the\nstorm. In the beautiful present the past is no longer needed. Reverently\nand gratefully let its volume be laid aside; and when again the shadows\nof the outward world fall upon the spirit may I not lack a good angel to\nremind me of its solace, even if he comes in the shape of a Barrington\nbeggar.",
