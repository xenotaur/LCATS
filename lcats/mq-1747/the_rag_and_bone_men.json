    "body": "The other one--Charpantier, he called himself--he and I were going back\nup the hill to the Foundation, carrying our bags, when I happened to\nremark I didn't think the Veld was sane anymore. (I call myself Maurer.)\n\nCharpantier said nothing for a moment. We kept walking, up the gravel\npath between the unimaginatively clipped hedges. But he was frowning a\nlittle, and after a while he said in an absent way: \"Now, how would one\ndetermine that?\" He looked straight into my eyes, which is something\nthat has always upset me, and challenged: \"I don't think one could.\"\n\nI felt the shock of inadequacy. Words come out of me--perfectly\naccurate words, I know; but I never know how, and sometimes when asked\nI forget.\n\nNow I must be very lucid; I must be his kind of man, I thought, and\npicked my way among my words. \"These things he's had us get,\" I said,\nputting the burlap bag down and stopping so as to hold Charpantier in\none place.\n\n\"He wants to build something unEarthly,\" Charpantier said, annoyed\nbecause I was playing his kind of trick on him, and so baldly. \"What\nstandards do you propose to judge by?\"\n\nBut I was right and he was wrong. Now it remained to make him see how.\n\"Yes. He wants to build something unEarthly. Out of Earthly parts.\nHe wants to take six radio tubes for an Earthly radio, three pieces\nof Earthly Lucite exactly 1/4 Earthly inch thick, a roll of Earthly\n16-gauge wire, a General Electric heat lamp, and all these other\nthings--the polystyrene foam blocks, the polyurethane plastic sheeting,\nthe polyvinyl insulating tape; what have you in your bag, Charpantier?\nOut of all this, he wants to make a Veldish thing.\"\n\n\"He's spent years learning about Earthly things,\" Charpantier pointed\nout. \"For years, we've brought him books. Men. Everything he needs.\nNow he's learned what the Earthly equivalents of Veldish materials\nare, and he's ready to make his new transporter.\" Charpantier had a\ndark face--dark hair, dark beard, dark eyes. When his dark brows drew\ntogether it was easy to see that his best expression was dark scorn.\n\n\n\n\"I think he's desperate,\" I said. \"I think he's learned all he can.\nHe's learned what the nearest Earthly equivalents to Veldish things\nare. And he's learned that all Earth can give him nothing closer. I\ndon't see how he could do better. Even he. You cannot make apples of\ncabbages. But he wants to get home--you know he wants so much to leave\nhere and get home--and now he's desperate, and is going to try making\na new transporter out of materials nothing like those in the one that\nbroke and marooned him here.\"\n\n\"And it won't function?\" Charpantier asked. \"There is that risk. But\nwhy shouldn't he try? What's insane in that?\"\n\n\"I fear it might work. I fear it might work in ways a transporter\nshould not.\" And I shivered, for if I say something I feel it, and I do\nnot feel anything I don't believe is right. I have been wrong, but not\noften ... or perhaps I forget.\n\nCharpantier smiled. \"How should a Veld transporter work?\"\n\n\"That's not the point!\" I cried at Charpantier's obstinacy in being\nCharpantier. \"I don't have to know. The Veld has to know, and be insane\nenough to try something different. Look--\" I said, searching, being\nmy own kind of man, now, and letting the words come straight from the\nimages in my head. \"Assume a man. Assume a man stranded on an island,\nfor years. Assume he has ways of realizing his heart's desire, if only\nhe can find the things to work with. But it's a small island. And while\nit's a good island how can it give a marooned man not only comfort but\nheart's desire? He searches. He perhaps send messengers, if he himself\ncannot penetrate the jungle; such messengers as he can command. And,\nin the end, after years, he knows he cannot have exactly what he wants.\nBut he can have something very near it. So, in the end, he takes a rag,\nand a bone, and a hank of hair--\"\n\n\"And makes a woman?\" Charpantier laughed. \"If he fails, what of it?\"\n\n\"But if he succeeds, Charpantier! If he _succeeds_!\" Couldn't he see?\n\"What sort of woman?\"\n\nCharpantier looked at me for a moment, but I hadn't made him see. He\nsaw only me, and I had taken up his time without delivering value. So\nhe chastised me.\n\n\"The Veld made me and you. Are you dissatisfied?\"\n\nHe had that trick, Charpantier. If you tried to give him a problem he\ncouldn't solve, he gave you a greater problem of your own, to add to\nthe one you already carried.\n\nI picked up my bag and followed him up the hill to the Foundation,\nwhere the Veld timelessly waited.\n\nIt was dusk, and as I walked I turned my eyes up to the stars. One eye\nwas larger than the other, and a different color. My nose sat askew\non my lumpen face. Though Charpantier was a hunchback, and lacked a\nfinger, still he was a handsome hunchback. But I, whom the Veld had\nmade second, with Charpantier's example, was merely whole. And from my\neyes, tears.\n\n\n\nWe entered the Foundation. It had been erected around the Veld, when he\nfirst came and there were men who could question.\n\nNow the building was neat and kept up, but all its many rooms were\nempty, and all its many machines were still. Charpantier had his\ncottage on the West--a very learned man had used it, while working with\nthe Veld--and I had mine on the East, where a military commander had\nkept his family.\n\nThe Veld lived in the heart of the Foundation, in the odd-shaped room\nwhose walls traced the configuration he had been forced to assume when\nhis broken transporter had interrupted his journey between--where?--and\nthe home he pined for. Men came from the town below the hill to care\nfor the building, but Charpantier or I had to go fetch them. They no\nlonger questioned. They distressed us with their constant need for\ncommanding, and so every time they were finished with their work we\ncommanded them homeward. No Earthly creature lived on the hill.\n\nThe Veld was kindly, but an end comes to kindness. The time came when\nthe questioning of men would have led them, if answered, irrevocably\ninto Veldish ways.\n\nIt was perhaps a kindness, too, that the Veld did what he did to\nquestioning creatures. But however it may have been, now there were\nonly men to be commanded. Charpantier commanded in the West, and I in\nthe East, and the Veld, though he permitted us to question all men, and\neach other, commanded us.\n\nCharpantier and I did not often speak to each other while in the\nFoundation. We were too near the Veld, and insufficiently full of\nourselves. But as we rode down the elevator, with its noise of metal\nsliding all alone in the world, Charpantier looked at me. And I knew\nwhat he looked.\n\nI have thought to myself that Charpantier says of everything: \"Why\nis this thing not perfect?\" while I say to myself: \"Where is the\nperfection in this thing?\" Surely my thought is as potent as his. But\nyou see his advantage over me, for he was forever safe from what I\nmight look at him, but I, I was not safe.\n\nWe reached the chamber of the Veld. We opened the door and displayed\nour accumulation to his perceptions.\n\n\"My-being reflects you,\" the Veld told us from his perception, and\nseeing that he was become beautiful, I knew we had done well. \"Now will\nI make, and take my way, and you in your sorrow stay to see the world\nrestored.\"\n\nThis was as he had promised the world, and us, before he put an end\nto questioning. Though only we remembered. But I wondered--I did not\nquestion; I wondered--as I imagined his making of the new transporter,\ntaking my imagined thing from what I knew of how he had made us; I\nwondered whether the world was safe.\n\nI thought of the chamber beside this one, where we had been born. I\nhad often been there, only to look. There is the tank--the Rochester,\nMinnesota, Biophysical Equipment Co. tank. And there is the Velikaya\nSocialisticheskaya Rossiya coagulator, and the IBM 704, and the Braun,\nBoveri heater. There stand the cabinets, with their Torsen, Held\nArtztmetal refrigeration units. And the cabinets stand full of flasks\nand ampules, and there is the autoclave full of Becton-Dickinson Yale\nsyringes, and dangling from the wall are the Waldos the Veld used to\nmanipulate all these things.\n\nAnd of all these Earthly things, the Veld made men not entirely\nEarthly, for the Veld is a Veld.\n\nNow soon, the new transporter would take the Veld away--in ways I\nwondered were perilous--and it would be Charpantier and I who stayed to\nsee the world restored.\n\nCharpantier and I, who called ourselves, but had no names.\n\nHe commanded us to go and we went, I East, Charpantier West. I saw\nCharpantier hurry down his side of the hill, handsome and hasty under\nthe stars. I walked--for me, to run is to risk--and I trembled,\nfor me to feel is to know, and the Veld was desperate. He slept at\nnight, secure from questions even though he slept, for his power once\nexercised was irrevocable so long as he existed. But tonight he did not\nsleep; he made.\n\nI thought of my assumed man, on his assumed island, red-eyed and\ntremulous of hand, bent over his pot, stirring, stirring, unable to\nwait for morning. I thought of the light from his fire, shining on\nthe dumb eyes of his faithful messengers waiting at the edge of his\nclearing. The messengers are dismissed from service, yet not quite sure\nthey are dismissed. And I thought of this Earth, and the Veld's old\npromise to us that tomorrow it would wake knuckling its eyes, and need\na loving voice to say there was an end to nightmares.\n\nI would speak and Charpantier would speak, but what would we say? And\nin what voices, born of the Veld's touch on the Waldos? And would there\nbe more than speaking to do?\n\nI did not think there was much I could do but speak. Charpantier lacks\na finger, but I ... I have hands, but I lack them.\n\nOh, but the stars were cold! The Moon in this season was a day Moon,\nand now below the horizon. Stars, stars and galaxies, but beyond them,\nwhere the Veldish beings lived, nothing I could see, and below the\nstars, too, here where I reached the brow of the hill and clumsily\nopened my wings, here, too, nothing, as I lurched into the night and in\ngreat strain beat toward the places of men.\n\n\n\nI had a favorite place; the place I had chosen to begin to speak from.\nIt was small, as men measure things--a few lights in the darkness,\nhere the sheen of a lake, there the tiered wooliness of trees--a town\nin which I had disposed those men who must first unbind themselves\nfrom the years of no questioning. For unlike the Veld and his\ntransporter--and even the Veld needed a transporter--Charpantier and I\ncould not be everywhere.\n\nIt was my thought to reassure these men first, and have them go out\nand reassure others, as older brothers will soothe the younger in the\nnight. I knew from an old argument that Charpantier planned the same.\nBut, of course, they would not be the same sort of men for Charpantier\nas for me.\n\nStill, they were all men. Once they had all rubbed the sleep from their\neyes they would tell each other what they saw, and in the end and all\nmen would have agreed on the shape of the world, so it would not matter\nwhat imperfections Charpantier pointed out, or what implicit glories I\nperceived.\n\nIf the Veld's hand did not tremble as he stirred his pot.\n\nAnd yet it had--it had; Charpantier had said more than he thought, when\nhe thought to stop up my mouth with myself.\n\nI faced away from the Foundation, now mile on mile behind me. But my\neyes turned inward, and in me my mind hovered over the Veld. I had no\nactual distant eye--no way of seeing beyond the curve of the world or\nthrough the haze of the air; no ear to listen to a sound so far away it\ncannot urge the molecules of air my pinions grope at. But often it is\nwell enough to think, for any thought seems accurate enough to act on,\nand in time thoughts grow so practiced that they might well be eyes.\nAnd so I saw the Veld, though I did not see him, and I saw him falter.\n\nIn me, the Veld suddenly told: \"I have made, and I go. Forgive me for\nyour sorrow.\" And I forgave him, as I had forgiven him long ago. For\nhis duty was to men, not to ourselves who were part of that duty. And\nCharpantier, I knew, had nothing to forgive, for he was glad of his\nsorrow.\n\nThe wind numbed my eyes. I wept.\n\nUnder the cold stars, my crude cheeks glistened. I hovered over the\ntown, where some men slept and some men worked, because some machines\nrun during the day and some run at night, and I listened for anything\nelse the Veld might have to tell, for he was my irrevocable commander\nas long as he existed on this Earth. I also listened with the ear of\nhabituated thought.\n\nAnd I heard. In my mind's eye, I saw the Veld use the Earthly\ntransporter, but it was not with my mind's ear alone that I heard what\nI heard.\n\nThe pot erupts. The stranded man claws back in agony so great he\ncannot even scream, arms, legs and face smoldering, and jounces on the\nground, to lie, to moan, to be a long mindless time dying. And at the\nclearing's edge the little messengers have no one to say what could be\ndone to soothe him.\n\nWhat now? Where to go, what to do, how to repair?\n\nOh, Veld, Veld, long-living Veld, what truly eternal sorrow!\n\nI sank down through the air, bereft and graceless. What could I do for\nthe Veld? All that remained to me was what I could say to men. But I\nknew as I landed among them that the Veld's promise could not be kept,\nsince the Veld was still here.\n\nI cried out to the men: \"Awake! Arise!\" They stumbled out of their\nhouses, but when I said to the first of them: \"Question me!\" he\nobediently answered: \"How?\"\n\n\n\nI go back to where the Foundation was, now and then. I bring doctors\nwith me, after each time it seems to me I have found a way to tell them\nwhat to seek. The Veld lies where his chamber was, before the stone\ndecayed, and tells me nothing.\n\nIf he truly reflects me, as he is now, then I don't know if I can bear\nto wait for the day when I can dash myself down from the outraged air\nand surrender myself to the sea-speckled rocks. The doctors say that\nif only someone would tell them what questions to ask about the Veld,\nand if only someone would give them the answers to the questions, they\nmight be able to do something.\n\nCharpantier is there sometimes, and mocks me. \"You're getting crazier\nevery day, Maurer,\" he says. \"Suppose you restore the Veld? Then what?\nDoes he make another transporter?\" He shakes his head. \"Poor Maurer.\nWhat're you doing to these people you bring here? What do you want from\nthem? Something the Veld himself couldn't accomplish?\"\n\nI try. I try to tell them how to question, and I command them to\nquestion. And I hope the Veld dies. But though Charpantier and I--even\nCharpantier and I--are growing a little older, the Veld is only\nmoribund, and no more dead than he was before the days when thirty\ngenerations of men battled to keep the southernmost edge of the\ncreeping ice from burying the Veld beyond the reach of hope.\n\nFor I hope--though I can see a sprig of silver, here and there, in\nCharpantier's darkness now. The Veld must be accessible to my hope,\nthough I must command millions of men.\n\nAnd I think Charpantier hopes, too, because so long as he can see me\nfailing he knows I am imperfect, but he wishes perfection for me. I\nknow he brings no doctors only because he has not yet found a way for a\nman to respond to the command, \"Be perfect!\"\n\nEach time the hope dies, I tell my men: \"Go home, now. Rest.\" And\nthey go home. But I? I blunder about, thinking that perhaps if I\ncould kill the Veld, that would be an end to it. But nothing can kill\nthe Veld, unless it be something the Veld knows of. So first we must\nheal the Veld. And healed he will once again seek his heart's desire,\nhopelessly. As do I. As do I.",
