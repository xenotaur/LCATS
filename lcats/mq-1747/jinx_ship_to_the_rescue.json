    "body": "Brevet Lieutenant Commander David Farragut Strykalski III of the\nTellurian Wing, Combined Solarian Navies, stood ankle deep in the\nviscous mud of Venusport Base and surveyed his new command with a\njaundiced eye. The hot, slimy, greenish rain that drenched Venusport\nfor two-thirds of the 720-hour day had stopped at last, but now a\nmiasmic fog was rising from the surrounding swampland, rolling across\nthe mushy landing ramp toward the grounded spaceship. Visibility was\ndropping fast, and soon porto-sonar sets would have to be used to find\nthe way about the surface Base. It was an ordinary day on Venus.\n\nStrike cursed Space Admiral Gorman and all his ancestors with a wealth\nof feeling. Then he motioned wearily to his companion, and together\nthey sloshed through the mud toward the ancient monitor.\n\nThe scaly bulk of the Tellurian Rocket Ship _Aphrodite_ loomed\nunhappily into the thick air above the two men as they reached the\nventral valve. Strike raised reluctant eyes to the sloping flank of the\nfat spaceship.\n\n\"It looks,\" he commented bitterly, \"like a pregnant carp.\"\n\nSenior Lieutenant Coburn Whitley--\"Cob\" to his friends--nodded in\nagreement. \"That's our Lover-Girl ... old Aphrodisiac herself. The ship\nwith the poison personality.\" Cob was the _Aphrodite's_ Executive,\nand he had been with her a full year ... which was a record for Execs\non the _Aphrodite_. She generally sent them Earthside with nervous\nbreakdowns in half that time.\n\n\"Tell me, Captain,\" continued Cob curiously, \"how does it happen\nthat you of all people happened to draw this tub for a command? I\nthought....\"\n\n\"You know Gorman?\" queried Strykalski.\n\nCob nodded. \"Oh, yes. Yes, indeed. Old Brass-bottom Gorman?\"\n\n\"The same.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Cob ran a hand over his chin speculatively, \"I know Gorman's\na prize stinker ... but you were in command of the _Ganymede_. And,\nafter all, you come from an old service family and all that. How come\nthis?\" He indicated the monitor expressively.\n\nStrike sighed. \"Well, now, Cob, I'll tell you. You'll be spacing with\nme and I guess you've a right to know the worst ... not that you\nwouldn't find it out anyway. I come from a long line of very sharp\noperators. Seven generations of officers and gentlemen. Lousy with\ntradition.\n\n\"The first David Farragut Strykalski, son of a sea-loving Polish\nimmigrant, emerged from World War II a four-striper and Congressional\nMedal winner. Then came David Farragut Strykalski, Jr., and, in the\nabortive Atomic War that terrified the world in 1961, he won a United\nNations Peace Citation. And then came David Farragut Strykalski III ...\nme.\n\n\"From such humble beginnings do great traditions grow. But something\nhappened when I came into the picture. I don't fit with the rest of\nthem. Call it luck or temperament or what have you.\n\n\"In the first place I seem to have an uncanny talent for saying the\nwrong thing to the wrong person. Gorman for example. And I take too\nmuch on my own initiative. Gorman doesn't like that. I lost the\n_Ganymede_ because I left my station where I was supposed to be running\nsection-lines to take on a bunch of colonists I thought were in\ndanger....\"\n\n\"The Procyon A people?\" asked Cob.\n\n\"So you've heard about it.\" Strike shook his head sadly. \"My tactical\nastrophysicist warned me that Procyon A might go nova. I left my\nroutine post and loaded up on colonists.\" He shrugged. \"Wrong guess. No\nnova. I made an ass of myself and lost the _Ganymede_. Gorman gave it\nto his former aide. I got this.\"\n\nCob coughed slightly. \"I heard something about Ley City, too.\"\n\n\"Me again. The _Ganymede's_ whole crew ended up in the Luna Base brig.\nWe celebrated a bit too freely.\"\n\nCob Whitley looked admiringly at his new Commander. \"That was the night\nafter the _Ganymede_ broke the record for the Centaurus B-Earth run,\nwasn't it? And then wasn't there something about....\"\n\n\"Canalopolis?\"\n\nWhitley nodded.\n\n\"That time I called the Martian Ambassador a spy. It was at a Tellurian\nEmbassy Ball.\"\n\n\"I begin to see what you mean, Captain.\"\n\n\"Strike's the name, Cob.\"\n\nWhitley's smile was expansive. \"Strike, I think you're going to like\nour old tin pot here.\" He patted the _Aphrodite's_ nether belly\naffectionately. \"She's old ... but she's loose. And we're not likely to\nmeet any Ambassadors or Admirals with her, either.\"\n\nStrykalski sighed, still thinking of his sleek _Ganymede_. \"She'll\ncarry the mail, I suppose. And that's about all that's expected of her.\"\n\nCob shrugged philosophically. \"Better than tanking that stinking rocket\nfuel, anyway. Deep space?\"\n\nStrike shook his head. \"Venus-Mars.\"\n\nCob scratched his chin speculatively. \"Perihelion run. Hot work.\"\n\nStrike was again looking at the spaceship's unprepossessing exterior.\n\"A surge-circuit monitor, so help me.\"\n\nCob nodded agreement. \"The last of her class.\"\n\n\n\nAnd she was not an inspiring sight. The fantastically misnamed\n_Aphrodite_ was a surge-circuit monitor of twenty guns built some ten\nyears back in the period immediately preceding the Ionian Subjugation\nIncident. She had been designed primarily for atomics, with a\nsurge-circuit set-up for interstellar flight. At least that was the\nplanner's view. In those days, interstellar astrogation was in its\nformative stage, and at the time of the _Aphrodite's_ launching the\nsurge-circuit was hailed as the very latest in space drives.\n\nHer designer, Harlan Hendricks, had been awarded a Legion of Merit\nfor her, and every silver-braided admiral in the Fleet had dreamed\nof hoisting his flag on one of her class. There had been three. The\n_Artemis_, the _Andromeda_, and the prototype ... old Aphrodisiac. The\nthree vessels had gone into action off Callisto after the Phobos Raid\nhad set off hostilities between the Ionians and the Solarian Combine.\n\nAll three were miserable failures.\n\nThe eager officers commanding the three monitors had found the circuit\ntoo appealing to their hot little hands. They used it ... in some way,\nwrongly.\n\nThe _Artemis_ exploded. The _Andromeda_ vanished in the general\ndirection of Coma Berenices glowing white hot from the heat of a\nruptured fission chamber and spewing gamma rays in all directions.\nAnd the _Aphrodite's_ starboard tubes blew, causing her to spend her\nstore of vicious energy spinning like a Fourth of July pinwheel under\n20 gravities until all her interior fittings ... including crew were a\ntangled, pulpy mess within her pressure hull.\n\nThe _Aphrodite_ was refitted for space. And because it was an integral\npart of her design, the circuit was rebuilt ... and sealed. She became\na workhorse, growing more cantankerous with each passing year. She\ncarried personnel.... She trucked ores. She ferried skeeterboats and\ntanked rocket fuel. Now, she would carry the mail. She would lift from\nVenusport and jet to Canalopolis, Mars, without delay or variation.\nRegulations, tradition and Admiral Gorman of the Inner Planet Fleet\nrequired it. And it was now up to David Farragut Strykalski III to see\nto it that she did....\n\nThe Officer of the Deck, a trim blonde girl in spotless greys saluted\nsmartly as Strike and Cob stepped through the valve.\n\nStrike felt vaguely uncomfortable. He knew, of course, that at least a\nthird of the personnel on board non-combat vessels of the Inner Planet\nFleet was female, but he had never actually had women on board a ship\nof his own, and he felt quite certain that he preferred them elsewhere.\n\nCob sensed his discomfort. \"That was Celia Graham, Strike. Ensign.\nRadar Officer. She's good, too.\"\n\nStrike shook his head. \"Don't like women in space. They make me\nuncomfortable.\"\n\nCob shrugged. \"Celia's the only officer. But about a quarter of our\nratings are women.\" He grinned maliciously. \"Equal rights, you know.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" commented the other sourly. \"Is that why they named\nthis ... ship 'Aphrodite'?\"\n\nWhitley saw fit to consider the question rhetorical and remained silent.\n\nStrike lowered his head to clear the arch of the flying-bridge\nbulkhead. Cob followed. He trailed his Captain through a jungle\nof chrome piping to the main control panels. Strike sank into an\nacceleration chair in front of the red DANGER seal on the surge-circuit\nrheostat.\n\n\"Looks like a drug-store fountain, doesn't it?\" commented Cob.\n\nStrykalski nodded sadly, thinking of the padded smoothness of the\n_Ganymede's_ flying-bridge. \"But she's home to us, anyway.\"\n\nThe thick Venusian fog had closed in around the top levels of the ship,\nhugging the ports and cutting off all view of the field outside. Strike\nreached for the squawk-box control.\n\n\"Now hear this. All officer personnel will assemble in the flying\nbridge at 600 hours for Captain's briefing. Officer of the Deck will\nrecall any enlisted personnel now on liberty....\"\n\nWhitley was on his feet, all the slackness gone from his manner.\n\"Orders, Captain?\"\n\n\"We can't do anything until the new Engineering Officer gets here.\nThey're sending someone down from the _Antigone_, and I expect him by\n600 hours. In the meantime you'll take over his part of the work. See\nto it that we are fueled and ready to lift ship by 602. Base will start\nloading the mail at 599:30. That's about all.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Whitley saluted and turned to go. At the bulkhead, he\npaused. \"Captain,\" he asked, \"Who is the new E/O to be?\"\n\nStrike stretched his long legs out on the steel deck. \"A Lieutenant\nHendricks, I. V. Hendricks, is what the orders say.\"\n\nCob thought hard for a moment and then shrugged his shoulders. \"I. V.\nHendricks.\" He shook his head. \"Don't know him.\"\n\n\n\nThe other officers of the _T.R.S. Aphrodite_ were in conference with\nthe Captain when Cob and the girl at his side reached the flying\nbridge. She was tall and dark-haired with regular features and pale\nblue eyes. She wore a service jumper with two silver stripes on the\nshoulder-straps, and even the shapeless garment could not hide the\nobvious trimness of her figure.\n\nStrike's back was toward the bulkhead, and he was addressing the others.\n\n\"... and that's about the story. We are to jet within 28,000,000 miles\nof Sol. Orbit is trans-Mercurian hyperbolic. With Mars in opposition,\nwe have to make a perihelion run and it won't be pleasant. But I'm\ncertain this old boiler can take it. I understand the old boy who\ndesigned her wasn't as incompetent as they say. But Space Regs are\nspecific about mail runs. This is important to you, Evans. Your\nastrogation has to be accurate to within twenty-five miles plus or\nminus the shortest route. And there'll be no breaking orbit. Now be\ncertain that the refrigeration units are checked, Mister Wilkins,\nespecially in the hydroponic cells. Pure air is going to be important.\"\n\n\"That's about all there is to tell you. As soon as our rather\nleisurely E/O gets here, we can jet with Aunt Nelly's postcard.\" He\nnodded. \"That's the story. Lift ship in....\" He glanced at his wrist\nchronograph, \"... in an hour and five.\"\n\nThe officers filed out and Cob Whitley stuck his head into the room.\n\"Captain?\"\n\n\"Come in, Cob.\" Strike's dark brows knit at the sight of the uniformed\ngirl in the doorway.\n\nCob's face was sober, but hidden amusement was kindling behind his\neyes. \"Captain, may I present Lieutenant Hendricks? Lieutenant _I-vy_\nHendricks?\"\n\nStrike looked blankly at the girl.\n\n\"Our new E/O, Captain,\" prompted Whitley.\n\n\"Uh ... welcome aboard, Miss Hendricks,\" was all the Captain could find\nto say.\n\nThe girl's eyes were cold and unfriendly. \"Thank you, Captain.\" Her\nvoice was like cracked ice tinkling in a glass. \"If I may have your\npermission to inspect the drives, Captain, I _may_ be able to\nconvince you that the designer of this vessel was not ... as you seem\nto think ... a senile incompetent.\"\n\nStrike was perplexed, and he showed it. \"Why, certainly ... uh ...\nMiss ... but why should you be so....\"\n\nThe girl's voice was even colder than before as she said, \"Harlan\nHendricks, Captain, is my father.\"\n\n\n\nA week in space had convinced Strike that he commanded a jinx ship.\nJetting sunward from Venus, the cantankerous _Aphrodite_ had burned a\nsteering tube through, and it had been necessary to go into free-fall\nwhile Jenkins, the Assistant E/O, and a damage control party effected\nrepairs. When the power was again applied, Old Aphrodisiac was running\nten hours behind schedule, and Strike and Evans, the Astrogation\nOfficer, were sweating out the unforeseen changes introduced into the\norbital calculations by the time spent in free-fall.\n\nThe _Aphrodite_ rumbled on toward the orbit of Mercury....\n\nFor all the tension between the occupants of the flying-bridge, Strike\nand Ivy Hendricks worked well together. And after a second week in\nspace, a reluctant admiration was replacing the resentment between\nthem. Ivy spent whatever time she could spare tinkering with her\nfather's pet surge-circuit and Strike began to realize that there was\nlittle she did not know about spaceship engineering. Then, too, Ivy\nspent a lot of time at the controls, and Strike was forced to admit\nthat he had never seen a finer job of piloting done by man or woman.\n\nAnd finally, Ivy hated old Brass-bottom Gorman even more than Strike\ndid. She felt that Gorman had ruined her father's career, and she was\ndedicating her life to proving her father right and Brass-bottom wrong.\nThere's nothing in the cosmos to nurture friendship like a common enemy.\n\nAt 30,000,000 miles from the sun, the _Aphrodite's_ refrigeration\nunits could no longer keep the interior of the ship at a comfortable\ntemperature. The thermometer stood at 102\uc9f8F, the very metal of\nthe ship's fittings hot to the touch. Uniforms were discarded,\ninsignia of rank vanished. The men dressed in fiberglass shorts and\nspaceboots, sweat making their naked bodies gleam like copper under the\nsodium-vapor lights. The women in the crew added only light blouses to\ntheir shorts ... and suffered from extra clothing.\n\nStrike was in the observation blister forward, when Ensign Graham\ncalled to say that she had picked up a radar contact sunward. The\nIFF showed the pips to be the _Lachesis_ and the _Atropos_. The two\ndreadnaughts were engaged in coronary research patrol ... a purely\nroutine business. But the thing that made Strike curse under his breath\nwas Celia Graham's notation that the _Atropos_ carried none other than\nSpace Admiral Horatio Gorman, Cominch Inplan.\n\nStrike thought it a pity that old Brass-bottom couldn't fall into\nHell's hottest pit ... and he told Ivy so.\n\nAnd she agreed.\n\n\n\nOld Aphrodisiac had reached perihelion when it happened. The\nthermometer stood at 135\uc9f8 and tempers were snapping. Cob and Celia\nGraham had tangled about some minor point concerning Lover-Girl's\nweight and balance. Ivy went about her work on the bridge without\nspeaking, and Strike made no attempt to brighten her sudden depression.\nLieutenant Evans had punched Bayne, the Tactical Astrophysicist,\nin the eye for some disparaging remark about Southern California\nwomanhood. The ratings were grumbling about the food....\n\nAnd then it happened.\n\nCob was in the radio room when Sparks pulled the flimsy from the\nscrambler. It was a distress signal from the _Lachesis_. The\n_Atropos_ had burst a fission chamber and was falling into the sun.\nRadiation made a transfer of personnel impossible, and the _Atropos_\nskeeterboats didn't have the power to pull away from the looming star.\nThe _Lachesis_ had a line on the sister dreadnaught and was valiantly\ntrying to pull the heavy vessel to safety, but even the thundering\npower of the _Lachesis'_ mighty drive wasn't enough to break Sol's\ndeathgrip on the battleship.\n\nA fleet of souped-up space-tugs was on its way from Luna and Venusport,\nbut they could not possibly arrive on time. And it was doubtful that\neven the tugs had the necessary power to drag the crippled _Atropos_\naway from a fiery end.\n\nCob snatched the flimsy from Sparks' hands and galloped for the\nflying-bridge. He burst in and waved the message excitedly in front of\nStrykalski's face.\n\n\"Have a look at this! Ye gods and little catfish! Read it!\"\n\n\"Well, dammit, hold it still so I can!\" snapped Strike. He read the\nmessage and passed it to Ivy Hendricks with a shake of his head.\n\nShe read it through and looked up exultantly. \"This is _it_! This is\nthe chance I've been praying for, Strike!\"\n\nHe returned her gaze sourly. \"For Gorman to fall into the sun? I recall\nI said something of the sort myself, but there are other men on those\nships. And, if I know Captain Varni on the _Lachesis_, he won't let go\nthat line even if he fries himself.\"\n\nIvy's eyes snapped angrily. \"That's not what I meant, and you know it!\nI mean this!\" She touched the red-sealed surge-circuit rheostat.\n\n\"That's very nice, Lieutenant,\" commented Cob drily. \"And I know that\nyou've been very busy adjusting that gismo. But I seem to recall that\nthe last time that circuit was uncorked everyone aboard became part of\nthe woodwork ... very messily, too.\"\n\n\"Let me understand you, Ivy,\" said Strike in a flat voice. \"What you\nare suggesting is that I risk my ship and the lives of all of us trying\nto pull old Gorman's fat out of the fire with a drive that's blown\nskyhigh three times out of three. Very neat.\"\n\nThere were tears bright in Ivy Hendricks' eyes and she sounded\ndesperate. \"But we can save those ships! We can, I _know_ we can! My\nfather designed this ship! I know every rivet of her! Those idiots off\nCallisto didn't know what they were doing. These ships needed specially\ntrained men. Father told them that! And I'm trained! I can take her in\nand save those ships!\" Her expression turned to one of disgust. \"Or are\nyou afraid?\"\n\n\"Frankly, Ivy, I haven't enough sense to be afraid. But are you so\ncertain that we can pull this off? If I make a mistake this time ...\nit'll be the last. For all of us.\"\n\n\"We can do it,\" said Ivy Hendricks simply.\n\nStrike turned to Cob. \"What do you say, Cob? Shall we make it hotter in\nhere?\"\n\nWhitley shrugged. \"If you say so, Strike. It's good enough for me.\"\n\nCelia Graham left the bridge shaking her head. \"We'll all be dead soon.\nAnd me so young and pretty.\"\n\nStrike turned to the squawk-box. \"Evans!\"\n\n\"Evans here,\" came the reply.\n\n\"Have Sparks get a DF fix on the _Atropos_ and hold it. We'll home on\ntheir carrier wave. They're in trouble and we're going after them. Plot\nthe course.\"\n\n\"Yes, Captain.\"\n\nStrike turned to Cob. \"Have the gun-crews stand by to relieve the\nblack-gang in the tube rooms. It's going to get hotter than the hinges\nof hell down there and we'll have to shorten shifts.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" Cob saluted and was gone.\n\nStrike returned to the squawk-box. \"Radar!\"\n\n\"Graham here,\" replied Celia from her station.\n\n\"Get a radar fix on the _Lachesis_ and hold it. Send your dope up to\nEvans and tell him to send us a range estimate.\"\n\n\"Yes, Captain,\" the girl replied crisply.\n\n\"Gun deck!\"\n\n\"Gun deck here, sir,\" came a feminine voice.\n\n\"Have number two starboard torpedo tube loaded with a fish and a spool\nof cable. Be ready to let fly on short notice ... any range.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" The girl switched off.\n\n\"And now you, Miss Hendricks.\"\n\n\"Yes, Captain?\" Her voice was low.\n\n\"Take over Control ... and Ivy....\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Don't kill us off.\" He smiled down at her.\n\nShe nodded silently and took her place at the control panel. Smoothly\nshe turned old Aphrodisiac's nose sunward....\n\n\n\nLashed together with a length of unbreakable beryllium steel cable,\nthe _Lachesis_ and the _Atropos_ fell helplessly toward the sun. The\nfrantic flame that lashed out from the _Lachesis'_ tube was fading, her\nfission chambers fusing under the terrific heat of splitting atoms.\nStill she tried. She could not desert her sister ship, nor could she\nsave her. Already the two ships had fallen to within 18,000,000 miles\nof the sun's terrifying atmosphere of glowing gases. The prominences\nthat spouted spaceward seemed like great fiery tentacles reaching for\nthe trapped men on board the warships. The atmospheric guiding fins,\nthe gun-turrets and other protuberances on both ships were beginning\nto melt under the fierce radiance. Only the huge refrigeration plants\non the vessels made life within them possible. And, even so, men were\ndying.\n\nSwiftly, the fat, ungainly shape of old Aphrodisiac drew near. In her\nflying-bridge, Strike and Ivy Hendricks watched the stricken ships in\nthe darkened viewport.\n\nThe temperature stood at 140\uc9f8 and the air was bitter with the smell\nof hot metal. Ivy's blouse clung to her body, soaked through with\nperspiration. Sweat ran from her hair into her eyes and she gasped\nfor breath in the oven hot compartment. Strike watched her with\napprehension.\n\nCarefully, Ivy circled the two warships. From the starboard tube on\nthe gun-deck, a homing rocket leapt toward the _Atropos_. It plunged\nstraight and true, spilling cable as it flew. It slammed up against\nthe hull, and stuck there, fast to the battleship's flank. Quickly,\na robocrane drew it within the ship and the cable was made secure.\nLike cosmic replicas of the ancient South American \"bolas,\" the three\nspacecraft whirled in space ... and all three began that sunward plunge\ntogether.\n\nThe heat in the _Aphrodite's_ bridge was unbearable. The thermometer\nshowed 145\uc9f8 and it seemed to Strike that Hell must be cool by\ncomparison.\n\nIvy fought her reeling senses and the bucking ship as the slack came\nout of the cable. Blackness was flickering at the edges of her field\nof vision. She could scarcely lift her hand to the red-sealed circuit\nrheostat. Shudderingly, she made the effort ... and failed. Conscious,\nbut too spent to move, she collapsed over the blistering hot instrument\npanel.\n\n\"_Ivy!_\" Strike was beside her, cradling her head in his arm.\n\n\"I ... I ... can't make it ... Strike. You'll ... have to run ... the\nshow ... after ... all.\"\n\nStrike laid her gently in an acceleration chair and turned toward the\ncontrol panel. His head was throbbing painfully as he broke the seal on\nthe surge-circuit.\n\nSlowly he turned the rheostat. Relays chattered. From deep within\nold Lover-Girl's vitals came a low whine. He fed more power into the\ncircuit. Cadmium rods slipped into lead sheaths decks below in the\ntube-rooms. The whining rose in pitch. The spinning of the ships in\nspace slowed. Stopped. With painful deliberation, they swung into line.\n\nMore power. The whine changed to a shriek. A banshee wail.\n\nCob's voice came through the squawk-box, soberly. \"Strike, Celia's\nfainted down here. We can't take much more of this heat.\"\n\n\"We're trying, Cob!\" shouted Strike over the whine of the circuit. The\ngauges showed the accumulators full. \"_Now!_\" He spun the rheostat to\nthe stops, and black space burst over his brain....\n\nThe last thing he remembered was a voice. It sounded like Bayne's. And\nit was shouting. \"We're moving 'em! We're pulling away! We're....\" And\nthat was all.\n\nThe space-tug _Scylla_ found them.\n\nThe three ships ... _Atropos_, _Lachesis_, and old Aphrodisiac ...\nlashed together and drifting in space. Every man and woman aboard out\ncold from the acceleration, and _Aphrodite's_ tanks bone dry. But they\nwere a safe 80,000,000 miles from Sol....\n\n\n\nThe orchestra was subdued, the officer's club softly lighted. Cob\nleaned his elbow on the bar and bent to inspect the blue ribbon of the\nSpatial Cross on Strike's chest. Then he inspected his own and nodded\nwith tipsy satisfaction. He stared out at the Martian night beyond the\nbroad windows and back again at Strike. His frown was puzzled.\n\n\"All right,\" said Strike, setting down his glass. \"What's on your mind,\nCob? Something's eating you.\"\n\nWhitley nodded very slowly. He took a long pull at his highball. \"I\nunderstand that you goofballed your chances of getting the _Ganymede_\nback when Gorman spoke his piece to you....\"\n\n\"All I said to him....\"\n\n\"I know. I know what you said ... and it won't bear repeating. But\nyou're not fooling me. You've fallen for old Lover-Girl and you don't\nwant to leave her. Ver-ry commendable. Loyal! Stout fellah! But what\nabout Ivy?\"\n\n\"Ivy?\"\n\nCob looked away. \"I thought that you and she ... well, I thought that\nwhen we got back ... well....\"\n\nStrike shook his head. \"She's gone to the Bureau of Ships with a\ndesigning job.\"\n\nCob waved an expressive arm in the air. \"But dammit, man, I thought....\"\n\n\"The answer is _no_. Ivy's a nice girl ... but....\" He paused and\nsighed. \"Since she was promoted to her father's old rank ... well....\"\nHe shrugged. \"Who wants a wife that ranks you?\"\n\n\"Never thought of that,\" mused Cob. For a long while he was silent;\nthen he pulled out an address book and leafed through until he came to\nthe pages marked \"Canalopolis, Mars.\"\n\nAnd he was gratified to see that Lieutenant Commander David Farragut\nStrykalski III was doing the same.",
