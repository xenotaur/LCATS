    "body": "\"People are basically alike,\" Harding said democratically. He sat idly\nagainst the strawlike matting of the hut wall and reached for a native\nfruit in a nearby bowl. \"They're all suckers, even the smartest of them;\nin fact, the ones who think they're the smartest generally wind up to be\nthe dumbest.\" Carefully, he bit into the fruit which resembled an orange\nand, mouth full, nodded approvingly. \"Say, these aren't bad. Try one.\"\n\nSheckly shook his head, determined to avoid as many aspects of this\nculture as he could. \"But these aren't people,\" he reminded, not happy\nwith the thought. \"They're lizards.\"\n\nHarding shrugged and settled back, his grinning features ruddy in the\nflaring torchlight. \"Humanoids have no monopoly on suckerhood. When it\ncomes to that, we're all brothers under the skin, no matter what\ncolor or how hard the skin may be.\" He sighed, contemplating the\nharvest-to-be. \"No, Sheckly, it'll be like taking candy from a baby.\nWe'll be out of here with our pockets bulging before the Space Patrol\ncan bat an eyelash in this direction.\"\n\nUnconvinced, Sheckly stared glumly through the open doorway of the hut\ninto the warm humid night, where a fire flared in the darkness and long\nshadows danced and slithered around it.\n\n\"It's not the Space Patrol I'm worried about,\" he said, after a while.\n\"I don't mind fleecing humanoids--\" he shivered, grimacing--\"but\nlizards!\"\n\nHarding laughed. \"Their riches are as good as anybody else's. The\ntrouble with you, Sheckly, you're too chicken-hearted. If it weren't for\nme, you'd still be small-timing back on Earth. It takes imagination to\nget along these days.\"\n\nSheckly grunted, for he had no ready answer to deny this truth. While he\ndidn't like the reference to his inability to get along in the world\nwithout Harding's help, the man was right about other things. It did\ntake imagination, all right, mixed with a generous supply of plain\nordinary guts; that, plus an eye focused unfalteringly on the good old\ncredit sign.\n\nHe certainly could not get along without Harding's timing. The man knew\njust when Patrol Ships would be at certain spots, knew their schedules\nfor visiting these small otherworlds, and always he was several steps\nahead of them. They went into a planet, their rocket ship loaded with\ngambling devices--cards, dice, roulette wheels, and other cultural\nrefinements--and set up shop which could be folded at a moment's notice\nif necessary. Natives seemed almost eager to be skinned of their riches,\nand he and Harding happily obliged them.\n\n\"Listen to them out there,\" Harding marveled, leaning forward to hear\nthe sharp scrapings that represented music. \"They must be having some\nkind of ceremony.\"\n\nSheckly nodded, shivering slightly, though the air was hot and humid. He\nwished again, as he often had in the past, he could have some of\nHarding's assurance, some of that unrelenting optimism that insisted\neverything would turn out favorably. But he didn't like these strange\nprimitive worlds, he didn't trust them or their inhabitants. The\nlizard-people had seemed friendly enough, but by looking at a strange\nreptile you couldn't tell how far it would jump. When the Earth ship\nlanded, the creatures had come slithering to them with all but a brass\nband, welcoming the Earthlings with the hissings that composed their\nlanguage. One of them--the official interpreter, he proclaimed\nhimself--knew a peculiarly good brand of English, and welcomed them in a\nmore satisfactory manner, but still Sheckly didn't like it. Harding had\ncalled him chicken-hearted, and he felt a certain amount of justified\nindignance at the description. Cautious would be a better word, he\ndecided.\n\n\n\nThese people appeared friendly to the Earthlings, but so did the\nEarthlings give the appearance of friendliness to the natives; that was\nproof in itself that you couldn't trust actions to indicate purpose. But\neven more than that, their basic alienness troubled Sheckly more than he\ndared admit aloud. Differences in skin color and modified body shapes\nwere one thing, but when a race was on a completely different\nevolutionary track it was a time for caution. These were a different\npeople, on a different planet under a different star. Their customs\nwere strange, how strange he could yet only guess, though he preferred\nnot to. This ceremony now, for example, what did it mean? A rite for\nsome serpent god perhaps. A dance in honor of the Earthmen's arrival. Or\nit might just as easily be a preliminary to a feast at which the\nvisitors would be the main course.\n\n\"I just wish we knew more about the creatures,\" he complained, trying to\nshove that last thought from his mind.\n\nHarding looked annoyed, as he drew his attention from the alien music\nwhich had fascinated him. \"Stop worrying, will you? They're probably\namong the friendliest creatures in the universe, even if they do look\nlike serpents out of Eden. And the friendly ones rate A-1 on my\nsucker-list.\"\n\nSheckly shuddered and cast an annoyed glance into the night. \"How can\nanybody concentrate with that infernal racket going on out there? Don't\nthey ever sleep?\"\n\n\"Patience,\" Harding advised calmly, \"is a noble virtue. Ah, here comes\nour interpreter.\"\n\nSheckly started involuntarily, as a scaley head thrust itself into the\nhut. The serpentman had a long sharp knife gleaming in one hand.\n\"Pardon, sirs,\" the head said slurringly, as a forked tongue sorted over\nthe unfamiliar syllables. \"The leader wishes to know will you join us?\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" Sheckly said, staring at the knife.\n\nHarding said, \"We should join them. We don't want to offend these\ncreatures, and if we're real friendly we might make out better.\"\n\n\"_You_ go out then. I'm going to see if I can get some sleep.\"\n\nHarding shrugged, his glance making it plain he knew Sheckly lacked\nnerve more than sleep. To the serpentman he said, \"Tell your leader my\ncompanion is tired from our long journey and would rest now. However, I\nwill be happy to join you.\"\n\n\"Yesss,\" the serpent head hissed and withdrew.\n\n\"Boy, will I be glad to get out of here,\" Sheckly muttered.\n\n\"Sometimes I wonder why I ever teamed up with a pansy like you,\nSheckly,\" Harding said harshly, a disgusted look on his face. \"There are\ntimes when I regret it.\" He turned and walked from the hut.\n\nSheckly stared bitterly after him. He felt no anger at the denunciation,\nonly a plaguing irritableness, an annoyance with both Harding and\nhimself. He should have gone out there with Harding, if only to show the\nman that he was not afraid, that he was no coward. And yet, as he sat\nthere listening to the strange sounds creeping across the warm dampness,\nhe made no move to rise, and he knew he would not.\n\nGrunting disgustedly, Sheckly stretched out on the floor matting and\ntried to think of other things. He stared at the orange-flaring torch\nand contemplated putting it out, but the sounds from the outside drifted\nin upon him and changed his mind. After a while, he closed his eyes and\ndozed.\n\n\n\nHe woke suddenly and sat upright, a cold sweat making him tremble.\nWhat had wakened him? he wondered. He had the vague notion that someone\nhad screamed, yet he wasn't sure. In the faltering torchlight, he could\nsee Harding had not returned. He listened intently to the noises\noutside, the scraping, the hissing, the slithering. No screams came.\n\nI'm not going to stay here, he told himself. I'll leave tomorrow, I\ndon't care what Harding says. I'll go crazy if I have to spend another\nnight like this. Exhausted, he fell asleep.\n\nMorning came, and the alien sun slanted orange rays through the cabin\ndoorway. Sheckly opened his eyes and stared at the thatched roof. The\ntorch had burned out, but it was no longer needed for light. Thank\ngoodness for morning, he thought. Morning brought a temporary sanity to\nthis world, and after the madness of the night it was a reprieve he\nwelcomed gladly. He had not opposed Harding till now, but desperation\nwas a strong incentive to rebellion. When Harding returned-- Startled,\nhe considered the thought. _When_ Harding returned?\n\nHe sat up and stared around him. Harding was not in sight. Panic came,\nand he leaped up, blood racing, as though to defend himself against\ninvisible enemies. Perhaps he'd gotten up early, Sheckly thought. But\nsuppose he hadn't returned? Suppose--\n\nHe jumped, as the interpreter entered the hut behind him. \"The Leader\nwishes you to join him for eating,\" the serpentman said.\n\n\"No,\" Sheckly said hastily. They weren't going to make a meal out of\nhim. \"No, thanks. Look, I've got to leave your planet. Leave,\nunderstand? Right away.\"\n\n\"The leader wishes you to join him,\" the creature repeated. This time\nthe sword crept into his hands.\n\nSheckly stared at the sword, and his heart leaped. He thought there was\na tinge of red on the blade's edge. Mentally, he shook his head. No, it\nwas his imagination again. Just imagination. Still, the drawn sword\nclearly indicated that the invitation was not to be refused.\n\n\"All right,\" he said weakly. \"All right, in a few minutes.\"\n\n\"Now,\" the other said.\n\n\"Okay, now,\" the Earthling agreed listlessly. \"Where is my companion?\"\n\n\"You will see him,\" the creature promised.\n\nSheckly breathed a sigh of relief at that. Harding was probably all\nright then. It made him feel better, though it would make the task of\nleaving much harder.\n\n\n\nThey had arrived at twilight the previous day, so they hadn't the\nopportunity to see the village in its entirety. They hadn't missed much,\nSheckly realized as he walked along, for the grouped huts were\nunimpressive, looking somewhat like a primitive African village back on\nEarth. But the Earthling would have preferred the most primitive Earth\nnative to these serpents. In the distance, the slim nose of the rocket\nship pointed the way to freedom, and Sheckly looked longingly at it.\n\nAt one end of the village was a small mountain of what appeared to be\nplastic clothing, milkily translucent--which was strange, since these\ncreatures wore no clothing. The Earthling wondered at this but did not\nask about it. Other thoughts more important troubled him.\n\n\"In here,\" the interpreter told him, stopping before the largest hut.\n\nHesitating briefly, Sheckly entered and the creature followed him in.\nSeated on the floor were the leader and his mate and several smaller\nreptiles that evidently were the children. Between them lay several\nbowls of food. Sheckly grimaced and turned hastily away as he saw small\ncrawling insects in one bowl.\n\n\"Sit down,\" the interpreter directed.\n\nHarding was not in evidence. \"Where is my companion?\" he asked.\n\nThe interpreter conferred briefly with the leader, then told Sheckly,\n\"He could not come. Sit down--eat.\"\n\nSheckly sat down, but he didn't feel like eating. He wondered _why_\nHarding could not come. At a sudden thought, he said, \"I have rations on\nmy ship--\"\n\n\"Eat,\" the interpreter said, gripping his sword.\n\nSheckly nodded weakly and reached out for the bowl of fruit, taking one\nthat resembled that which Harding had eaten the previous night. It\nwasn't bad. The leader stuffed a fistful of squirming insects in his\nmouth and offered the bowl to Sheckly, who shook his head as politely as\nhe could and indicated the fruit in his hand.\n\nFortunately, the serpentman did not insist on his taking anything other\nthan fruit, so the meal passed without physical discomfort.\n\nWhen they were through, the leader hissed several syllables to the\ninterpreter, who said, \"The leader wishes to see your games. You will\nset them up now.\"\n\nSheckly ran his tongue over dry lips. \"They're in the ship,\" he said,\nand eagerness crept into his voice. \"I'll have to get them.\" Once inside\nthe ship, he'd never come back. He'd slam the airlock door and bolt it\nand then blast off as fast as he could get the motors going, Harding or\nno Harding. He got up.\n\n\"We will help you,\" the interpreter said.\n\n\"No. I can do it myself.\"\n\n\"We will help you,\" the interpreter insisted firmly. His eyes bored into\nthe Earthling, as though daring him to refuse again.\n\nSheckly's mouth felt dry once more. \"Where's Harding?\" he demanded.\n\"Where's the other Earth man? What have you done with him?\"\n\nThe interpreter looked at the leader, who nodded. The interpreter said\ngravely, \"It is too bad. It is the season for the shedding of skins. At\nthe shedding feast last night--\"\n\n\"The shedding of skins!\" Sheckly said, remembering the pile he'd seen at\none corner of the village; \"those translucent things were your cast-off\nskins.\" He recalled that some reptiles back on Earth had regular seasons\nof shedding. That intelligent creatures should do it made him feel\nslightly sick.\n\n\"Your friend joined us last night,\" the serpentman went on. \"But he\ncould not shed properly, so--\"\n\nSheckly felt his blood turn to ice.\n\n\"--so we helped him.\"\n\n\"You _what_?\"\n\n\"We helped him out of his skin,\" the serpentman went on calmly. \"We try\nto help those who are friends with us. Your friend had trouble getting\nhis skin off, but with our help--\"\n\n\"No!\" the Earthling cried, trying to reject the thought.\n\nThe full realization of what had happened struck him at once. Despite\nhimself, he could picture Harding struggling, trying to convince these\ncreatures that Earthlings don't shed their skins. His struggles must\nhave convinced them only that he was having trouble shedding, so they\n\"helped him.\" They had come to skin the natives, but the reverse was\nhappening--only literally.\n\n\"Where--where is he?\" he asked finally, though he knew it didn't really\nmatter.\n\n\"We will take you to him,\" the interpreter said.\n\n\"No,\" Sheckly cried. \"No, I--I'd rather not.\"\n\nThe serpentman nodded. \"As you wish. He does not look pretty. I hope\nthat tonight you do not have as much trouble.\"\n\nSheckly's eyes went wide. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"In your shedding,\" the serpentman explained. \"We will try to help you\nall we can, of course.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" the Earthling agreed weakly, licking cottony lips. He\nwondered how he could just stand there so apparently calm, instead of\nletting out a shriek and running as fast as he could for the rocket\nship. He decided it was some sort of paralysis, the shock of finding\nhimself in the middle of something so alien his mind told him it\ncouldn't possibly be.\n\n\n\nKnees wobbling, Sheckly went to the door and out into the morning. That\nhe had gotten that far surprised him pleasantly. The tall rocket ship\nwas in a clearing several yards beyond the edge of the village. He\nheaded for it. He thought of running, but his legs felt like rubber, his\nblood like ice. He walked past the pile of drying skins on the ground\nwithout looking at them, and he was followed by the interpreter and\nseveral others whom the serpentman had motioned to join them. Except for\ntheir swords, they had no weapons, he noticed. Poor Harding, he thought,\nand wondered if the Earthling's skin were somewhere in the pile; he felt\nsick, thinking about it.\n\n\"You'd better stay outside the ship,\" he suggested testily. \"I'll lower\nthe equipment to you.\"\n\n\"I will go aboard with you,\" the serpentman said.\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"I will go aboard with you.\"\n\nSheckly shrugged, but he hardly felt complacent. He felt as though a\ngiant icy hand held onto his spine with a firm paralyzing grip. He\ntrembled visibly. Got to think, he told himself desperately, got to plan\nthis out. But fear jumbled his thoughts, and he could only think of\nHarding back in the village minus his skin, and of what was going to\nhappen that night if all went as these creatures planned.\n\nThe second thought was the more terrifying, and when they were within a\nhundred feet of the rocket ship, Sheckly broke into a frantic run.\n\n\"Stop,\" the interpreter cried.\n\nSheckly had no intentions of stopping. His glands told him to run, and\nhe ran. He ran as fast as he could and didn't look back. He imagined the\nserpentman was on his heels, knife poised, and he ran even faster. He\nreached the rocket ship and went up the ladder, scrambling, missing his\nfoothold, pulling himself up with clutching hands. He threw himself\nthrough the airlock and slammed the massive door behind him.\n\nHe ran through the metal corridors to the control room. They must be on\nthe ladder, he thought, prying at the airlock with their metal swords.\nHe pressed switches, slammed down on the throttle, and the sweet music\nof the rockets came and pressed him into his seat.\n\nHe looked down at the planet dwindling into space below him and he\nlaughed hysterically, thinking of the narrow escape he'd had. No more\nplanets for him, no more trying to skin anyone.\n\n\n\n\"There it goes,\" the Space Patrolman said, watching the rocket rise.\n\nHarding trembled with helpless rage. \"That blasted fool Sheckly'll lead\nyou right to the money, too,\" he complained.\n\n\"That's the way we planned it,\" the Patrolman smiled. \"I must compliment\nour native friends on their fine acting. Your pal took off like a scared\nrabbit.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Harding grimaced, clenching his fists as though wishing he had\nsomeone's neck in them.\n\n\"Don't blame your friend too much,\" the Patrolman advised. \"Whether you\nrealize it or not, the fact that you were consciously avoiding our\nschedules caused you to follow a pattern in your visits to these\nouterspace planets; we just figured a bit ahead of you and posted hidden\npatrols on all the inhabited planets in this sector, knowing that sooner\nor later you'd land on one of them. We spotted your ship last night and\nhurried over by 'copter so we wouldn't be seen.\"\n\n\"Forget the synopsis,\" Harding growled. \"You walked in when these\nblasted lizards were making believe they were going to skin me alive.\nThey didn't have to act so realistic about it.\"\n\n\"You're wrong about one thing,\" the Patrolman said. \"The act didn't\nstart until after we arrived to direct it.\"\n\nHarding looked at him, puzzled. \"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"We arrived, as the books say, just in time,\" the Patrolman told him.\n\"They _weren't_ making believe.\" He offered a bowl of fruit to his\nprisoner. \"We'll be here for another hour yet. Eat something.\"\n\nWeakly, Harding shook his head no. He sat down, suddenly pale at what\nthe officer had said.\n\nHe didn't feel very hungry.\n\n                                                           ... THE END\n\n",
