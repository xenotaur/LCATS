    "body": "Richard Herrick was a young man with a gentle disposition, much\nmoney, and no sense of humor. His object in life was to marry Miss\nCatherweight. For three years she had tried to persuade him this could\nnot be, and finally, in order to convince him, married some one else.\nWhen the woman he loves marries another man, the rejected one is\npopularly supposed to take to drink or to foreign travel. Statistics\nshow that, instead, he instantly falls in love with the best friend of\nthe girl who refused him. But, as Herrick truly loved Miss Catherweight,\nhe could not worship any other woman, and so he became a lover of\nnature. Nature, he assured his men friends, does not disappoint you. The\nmore thought, care, affection you give to nature, the more she gives\nyou in return, and while, so he admitted, in wooing nature there are\nno great moments, there are no heart-aches. Jackson, one of the men\nfriends, and of a frivolous disposition, said that he also could admire\na landscape, but he would rather look at the beautiful eyes of a girl\nhe knew than at the Lakes of Killarney, with a full moon, a setting sun,\nand the aurora borealis for a background. Herrick suggested that,\nwhile the beautiful eyes might seek those of another man, the Lakes of\nKillarney would always remain where you could find them. Herrick pursued\nhis new love in Connecticut on an abandoned farm which he converted into\na \"model\" one. On it he established model dairies and model incubators.\nHe laid out old-fashioned gardens, sunken gardens, Italian gardens,\nlandscape gardens, and a game preserve.\n\nThe game preserve was his own especial care and pleasure. It consisted\nof two hundred acres of dense forest and hills and ridges of rock. It\nwas filled with mysterious caves, deep chasms, tiny gurgling streams,\nnestling springs, and wild laurel. It was barricaded with fallen\ntree-trunks and moss-covered rocks that had never felt the foot of man\nsince that foot had worn a moccasin. Around the preserve was a high\nfence stout enough to keep poachers on the outside and to persuade\nthe wild animals that inhabited it to linger on the inside. These wild\nanimals were squirrels, rabbits, and raccoons. Every day, in sunshine\nor in rain, entering through a private gate, Herrick would explore this\nholy of holies. For such vermin as would destroy the gentler animals\nhe carried a gun. But it was turned only on those that preyed upon his\nfavorites. For hours he would climb through this wilderness, or, seated\non a rock, watch a bluebird building her nest or a squirrel laying in\nrations against the coming of the snow. In time he grew to think he knew\nand understood the inhabitants of this wild place of which he was the\noverlord. He looked upon them not as his tenants but as his guests. And\nwhen they fled from him in terror to caves and hollow tree-trunks, he\nwished he might call them back and explain he was their friend, that it\nwas due to him they lived in peace. He was glad they were happy. He was\nglad it was through him that, undisturbed, they could live the simple\nlife.\n\nHis fall came through ambition. Herrick himself attributed it to his\ntoo great devotion to nature and nature's children. Jackson, he of the\nfrivolous mind, attributed it to the fact that any man is sure to come\nto grief who turns from the worship of God's noblest handiwork, by which\nJackson meant woman, to worship chipmunks and Plymouth Rock hens. One\nnight Jackson lured Herrick into New York to a dinner and a music hall.\nHe invited also one Kelly, a mutual friend of a cynical and combative\ndisposition. Jackson liked to hear him and Herrick abuse each other, and\nalways introduced subjects he knew would cause each to lose his temper.\n\nBut, on this night, Herrick needed no goading. He was in an ungrateful\nmood. Accustomed to food fresh from the soil and the farmyard, he\nsneered at hothouse asparagus, hothouse grapes, and cold-storage quail.\nAt the music hall he was even more difficult. In front of him sat a\nstout lady who when she shook with laughter shed patchouli and a man who\nsmoked American cigarettes. At these and the steam heat, the nostrils of\nHerrick, trained to the odor of balsam and the smoke of open wood fires,\ntook offense. He refused to be amused. The monologue artist, in whom\nJackson found delight, caused Herrick only to groan; the knockabout\ncomedians he hoped would break their collar-bones; the lady who danced\nSalome, and who fascinated Kelly, Herrick prayed would catch pneumonia\nand die of it. And when the drop rose upon the Countess Zichy's bears,\nhis dissatisfaction reached a climax.\n\nThere were three bears--a large papa bear, a mamma bear, and the baby\nbear. On the programme they were described as Bruno, Clara, and Ikey.\nThey were of a dusty brown, with long, curling noses tipped with white,\nand fat, tan-colored bellies. When father Bruno, on his hind legs and\nbare feet, waddled down the stage, he resembled a Hebrew gentleman in a\nbrown bathing suit who had lost his waist-line. As he tripped doubtfully\nforward, with mincing steps, he continually and mournfully wagged his\nhead. He seemed to be saying: \"This water is much too cold for me.\" The\nmamma bear was dressed in a poke bonnet and white apron, and resembled\nthe wolf who frightened Little Red Riding-Hood, and Ikey, the baby bear,\nwore rakishly over one eye the pointed cap of a clown. To those who knew\ntheir vaudeville, this was indisputable evidence that Ikey would furnish\nthe comic relief. Nor did Ikey disappoint them. He was a wayward son.\nWhen his parents were laboriously engaged in a boxing-match, or dancing\nto the \"Merry Widow Waltz,\" or balancing on step-ladders, Ikey, on all\nfours, would scamper to the foot-lights and, leaning over, make a swift\ngrab at the head of the first trombone. And when the Countess Zichy,\napprised by the shouts of the audience of Ikey's misconduct, waved a toy\nwhip, Ikey would gallop back to his pedestal and howl at her. To every\none, except Herrick and the first trombone, this playfulness on the part\nof Ikey furnished great delight.\n\nThe performances of the bears ended with Bruno and Clara dancing heavily\nto the refrain of the \"Merry Widow Waltz,\" while Ikey pretended to\nconduct the music of the orchestra. On the final call, Madame Zichy\nthrew to each of the animals a beer bottle filled with milk; and the\ngusto with which the savage-looking beasts uncorked the bottles and\ndrank from them greatly amused the audience. Ikey, standing on his hind\nlegs, his head thrown back, with both paws clasping the base of the\nbottle, shoved the neck far down his throat, and then, hurling it\nfrom him, and cocking his clown's hat over his eyes, gave a masterful\nimitation of a very intoxicated bear.\n\n\"That,\" exclaimed Herrick hotly, \"is a degrading spectacle. It degrades\nthe bear and degrades me and you.\"\n\n\"No, it bores me,\" said Kelly.\n\n\"If you understood nature,\" retorted Herrick, \"and nature's children, it\nwould infuriate you.\"\n\n\"I don't go to a music hall to get infuriated,\" said Kelly.\n\n\"Trained dogs I don't mind,\" exclaimed Herrick. \"Dogs are not wild\nanimals. The things they're trained to do are of USE. They can guard the\nhouse, or herd sheep. But a bear is a wild beast. Always will be a wild\nbeast. You can't train him to be of use. It's degrading to make him ride\na bicycle. I hate it! If I'd known there were to be performing bears\nto-night, I wouldn't have come!\"\n\n\"And if I'd known you were to be here to-night, I wouldn't have come!\"\nsaid Kelly. \"Where do we go to next?\"\n\nThey went next to a restaurant in a gayly decorated cellar. Into this\nyoung men like themselves and beautiful ladies were so anxious to hurl\nthemselves that to restrain them a rope was swung across the entrance\nand page boys stood on guard. When a young man became too anxious to\nspend his money, the page boys pushed in his shirt front. After they\nhad fought their way to a table, Herrick ungraciously remarked he would\nprefer to sup in a subway station. The people, he pointed out, would be\nmore human, the decorations were much of the same Turkish-bath school of\nart, and the air was no worse.\n\n\"Cheer up, Clarence!\" begged Jackson, \"you'll soon be dead. To-morrow\nyou'll be back among your tree-toads and sunsets. And, let us hope,\" he\nsighed, \"no one will try to stop you!\"\n\n\"What worries me is this,\" explained Herrick. \"I can't help thinking\nthat, if one night of this artificial life is so hard upon me, what must\nit be to those bears!\"\n\nKelly exclaimed, with exasperation: \"Confound the bears!\" he cried. \"If\nyou must spoil my supper weeping over animals, weep over cart-horses.\nThey work. Those bears are loafers. They're as well fed as pet canaries.\nThey're aristocrats.\"\n\n\"But it's not a free life!\" protested Herrick. \"It's not the life they\nlove.\"\n\n\"It's a darned sight better,\" declared Kelly, \"than sleeping in a damp\nwood, eating raw blackberries----\"\n\n\"The more you say,\" retorted Herrick, \"the more you show you know\nnothing whatsoever of nature's children and their habits.\"\n\n\"And all you know of them,\" returned Kelly, \"is that a cat has nine\nlives, and a barking dog won't bite. You're a nature faker.\" Herrick\nrefused to be diverted.\n\n\"It hurt me,\" he said. \"They were so big, and good-natured, and\nhelpless. I'll bet that woman beats them! I kept thinking of them as\nthey were in the woods, tramping over the clean pine needles, eating\nnuts, and--and honey, and----\"\n\n\"Buns!\" suggested Jackson.\n\n\"I can't forget them,\" said Herrick. \"It's going to haunt me, to-morrow,\nwhen I'm back in the woods; I'll think of those poor beasts capering\nin a hot theatre, when they ought to be out in the open as God meant\nthey----\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" protested Kelly, \"take 'em to the open. And turn 'em\nloose! And I hope they bite YOU!\"\n\nAt this Herrick frowned so deeply that Kelly feared he had gone too far.\nInwardly, he reproved himself for not remembering that his friend lacked\na sense of humor. But Herrick undeceived him.\n\n\"You are right!\" he exclaimed. \"To-morrow I will buy those bears, take\nthem to the farm, and turn them loose!\"\n\nNo objections his friend could offer could divert him from his purpose.\nWhen they urged that to spend so much money in such a manner was\ncriminally wasteful, he pointed out that he was sufficiently rich to\nindulge any extravagant fancy, whether in polo ponies or bears; when\nthey warned him that if he did not look out the bears would catch him\nalone in the woods, and eat him, he retorted that the bears were now\neducated to a different diet; when they said he should consider the\npeace of mind of his neighbors, he assured them the fence around his\ngame preserve would restrain an elephant.\n\n\"Besides,\" protested Kelly, \"what you propose to do is not only\nimpracticable, but it's cruelty to animals. A domesticated animal can't\nreturn to a state of nature, and live.\"\n\n\"Can't it?\" jeered Herrick. \"Did you ever read 'The Call of the Wild'?\"\n\n\"Did you ever read,\" retorted Kelly, \"what happened at the siege of\nLadysmith when the oats ran low and they drove the artillery horses out\nto grass? They starved, that's all. And if you don't feed your bears on\nmilk out of a bottle they'll starve too.\"\n\n\"That's what will happen,\" cried Jackson; \"those bears have forgotten\nwhat a pine forest smells like. Maybe it's a pity, but it's the fact.\nI'll bet if you could ask them whether they'd rather sleep in a cave\non your farm or be headliners in vaudeville, they'd tell you they were\n'devoted to their art.'\"\n\n\"Why!\" exclaimed Kelly, \"they're so far from nature that if they didn't\nhave that colored boy to comb and brush them twice a day they'd be\nashamed to look each other in the eyes.\"\n\n\"And another thing,\" continued Jackson, \"trained animals love to 'show\noff.' They're children. Those bears ENJOY doing those tricks. They ENJOY\nthe applause. They enjoy dancing to the 'Merry Widow Waltz.' And if you\nlock them up in your jungle, they'll get so homesick that they'll give a\nperformance twice a day to the squirrels and woodpeckers.\"\n\n\"It's just as hard to unlearn a thing as to learn it,\" said Kelly\nsententiously. \"You can't make a man who has learned to wear shoes enjoy\ngoing around in his bare feet.\"\n\n\"Rot!\" cried Herrick. \"Look at me. Didn't I love New York? I loved it so\nI never went to bed for fear I'd miss something. But when I went 'Back\nto the Land,' did it take me long to fall in love with the forests and\nthe green fields? It took me a week. I go to bed now the same day I get\nup, and I've passed on my high hat and frock coat to a scarecrow. And\nI'll bet you when those bears once scent the wild woods they'll stampede\nfor them like Croker going to a third alarm.\"\n\n\"And I repeat,\" cried Kelly, \"you are a nature faker. And I'll leave it\nto the bears to prove it.\"\n\n\"We have done our best,\" sighed Jackson. \"We have tried to save him\nmoney and trouble. And now all he can do for us in return is to give us\nseats for the opening performance.\"\n\nWhat the bears cost Herrick he never told. But it was a very large sum.\nAs the Countess Zichy pointed out, bears as bears, in a state of nature,\nare cheap. If it were just a bear he wanted, he himself could go to\nPike County, Pennsylvania, and trap one. What he was paying for, she\nexplained, was the time she had spent in educating the Bruno family, and\nadded to that the time during which she must now remain idle while she\neducated another family.\n\nHerrick knew for what he was paying. It was the pleasure of rescuing\nunwilling slaves from bondage. As to their expensive education, if\nthey returned to a state of ignorance as rapidly as did most college\ngraduates he knew, he would be satisfied. Two days later, when her\nengagement at the music hall closed, Madame Zichy reluctantly turned\nover her pets to their new manager. With Ikey she was especially loath\nto part.\n\n\"I'll never get one like him,\" she wailed, \"Ikey is the funniest\nfour-legged clown in America. He's a natural-born comedian. Folks think\nI learn him those tricks, but it's all his own stuff. Only last week we\nwas playing Paoli's in Bridgeport, and when I was putting Bruno through\nthe hoops, Ikey runs to the stage-box and grabs a pound of caramels out\nof a girl's lap-and swallows the box. And in St. Paul, if the trombone\nhadn't worn a wig, Ikey would have scalped him. Say, it was a scream!\nWhen the audience see the trombone snatched bald-headed, and him trying\nto get back his wig, and Ikey chewing it, they went crazy. You can't\nlearn a bear tricks like that. It's just genius. Some folks think I\ntaught him to act like he was intoxicated, but he picked that up, too,\nall by himself, through watching my husband. And Ikey's very fond of\nbeer on his own account. If I don't stop them, the stage hands would be\nalways slipping him drinks. I hope you won't give him none.\"\n\n\"I will not!\" said Herrick.\n\nThe bears, Ikey in one cage and Bruno and Clara in another, travelled\nby express to the station nearest the Herrick estate. There they were\ntransferred to a farm wagon, and grumbling and growling, and with\nIkey howling like an unspanked child, they were conveyed to the game\npreserve. At the only gate that entered it, Kelly and Jackson and a\nspecially invited house party of youths and maidens were gathered to\nreceive them. At a greater distance stood all of the servants and farm\nhands, and as the wagon backed against the gate, with the door of Ikey's\ncage opening against it, the entire audience, with one accord, moved\nsolidly to the rear. Herrick, with a pleased but somewhat nervous smile,\nmounted the wagon. But before he could unlock the cage Kelly demanded to\nbe heard. He insisted that, following the custom of all great artists,\nthe bears should give a farewell performance.\n\nHe begged that Bruno and Clara might be permitted to dance together. He\npointed out that this would be the last time they could listen to the\nstrains of the \"Merry Widow Waltz.\" He called upon everybody present to\nwhistle it.\n\nThe suggestion of an open-air performance was received coldly. At the\nmoment no one seemed able to pucker his lips into a whistle, and some\neven explained that with that famous waltz they were unfamiliar.\n\nOne girl attained an instant popularity by pointing out that the bears\ncould waltz just as well on one side of the fence as the other. Kelly,\ncheated of his free performance, then begged that before Herrick\ncondemned the bears to starve on acorns, he should give them a farewell\ndrink, and Herrick, who was slightly rattled, replied excitedly that\nhe had not ransomed the animals only to degrade them. The argument was\ninterrupted by the French chef falling out of a tree. He had climbed it,\nhe explained, in order to obtain a better view.\n\nWhen, in turn, it was explained to him that a bear also could climb\na tree, he remembered he had left his oven door open. His departure\nreminded other servants of duties they had neglected, and one of\nthe guests, also, on remembering he had put in a long-distance call,\nhastened to the house. Jackson suggested that perhaps they had better\nall return with him, as the presence of so many people might frighten\nthe bears. At the moment he spoke, Ikey emitted a hideous howl, whether\nof joy or rage no one knew, and few remained to find out. It was not\nuntil Herrick had investigated and reported that Ikey was still behind\nthe bars that the house party cautiously returned. The house party\nthen filed a vigorous protest. Its members, with Jackson as spokesman,\ncomplained that Herrick was relying entirely too much on his supposition\nthat the bears would be anxious to enter the forest. Jackson pointed out\nthat, should they not care to do so, there was nothing to prevent them\nfrom doubling back under the wagon; in which case the house party and\nall of the United States lay before them. It was not until a lawn-tennis\nnet and much chicken wire was stretched in intricate thicknesses\nacross the lower half of the gate that Herrick was allowed to proceed.\nUnassisted, he slid back the cage door, and without a moment's\nhesitation Ikey leaped from the wagon through the gate and into the\npreserve. For an instant, dazed by the sudden sunlight, he remained\nmotionless, and then, after sniffing delightedly at the air, stuck his\nnose deep into the autumn leaves. Turning on his back, he luxuriously\nand joyfully kicked his legs, and rolled from side to side.\n\nHerrick gave a shout of joy and triumph. \"What did I tell you!\" he\ncalled. \"See how he loves it! See how happy he is.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" protested Kelly. \"He thought you gave him the sign to\n'roll over.' Tell him to 'play dead,' and he'll do that.\" \"Tell ALL\nthe bears to 'play dead,'\" begged Jackson, \"until I'm back in the\nbilliard-room.\"\n\nFlushed with happiness, Herrick tossed Ikey's cage out of the wagon,\nand opened the door of the one that held Bruno and Clara. On their part,\nthere was a moment of doubt. As though suspecting a trap, they moved to\nthe edge of the cage, and gazed critically at the screen of trees and\ntangled vines that rose before them.\n\n\"They think it's a new backdrop,\" explained Kelly.\n\nBut the delight with which Ikey was enjoying his bath in the autumn\nleaves was not lost upon his parents. Slowly and clumsily they dropped\nto the ground. As though they expected to be recalled, each turned to\nlook at the group of people who had now run to peer through the wire\nmeshes of the fence. But, as no one spoke and no one signalled, the\nthree bears, in single file, started toward the edge of the forest. They\nhad of cleared space to cover only a little distance, and at each step,\nas though fearful they would be stopped and punished, one or the other\nturned his head. But no one halted them. With quickening footsteps the\nbears, now almost at a gallop, plunged forward. The next instant they\nwere lost to sight, and only the crackling of the underbrush told that\nthey had come into their own.\n\nHerrick dropped to the ground and locked himself inside the preserve.\n\n\"I'm going after them,\" he called, \"to see what they'll do.\"\n\nThere was a frantic chorus of entreaties.\n\n\"Don't be an ass!\" begged Jackson. \"They'll eat you.\" Herrick waved his\nhand reassuringly.\n\n\"They won't even see me,\" he explained. \"I can find my way about this\nplace better than they can. And I'll keep to windward of them, and watch\nthem. Go to the house,\" he commanded. \"I'll be with you in an hour, and\nreport.\"\n\nIt was with real relief that, on assembling for dinner, the house party\nfound Herrick, in high spirits, with the usual number of limbs, and\nawaiting them. The experiment had proved a great success. He told how,\nunheeded by the bears, he had, without difficulty, followed in their\ntracks. For an hour he had watched them. No happy school-children, let\nloose at recess, could have embraced their freedom with more obvious\ndelight. They drank from the running streams, for honey they explored\nthe hollow tree-trunks, they sharpened their claws on moss-grown rocks,\nand among the fallen oak leaves scratched violently for acorns. So\nsatisfied was Herrick with what he had seen, with the success of his\nexperiment, and so genuine and unselfish was he in the thought of the\nhappiness he had brought to the beasts of the forests, that for him no\ndinner ever passed more pleasantly. Miss Waring, who sat next to her\nhost, thought she had seldom met a man with so kind and simple a nature.\nShe rather resented the fact, and she was inwardly indignant that so\nmuch right feeling and affection could be wasted on farmyard fowls, and\nfour-footed animals. She felt sure that some nice girl, seated at the\nother end of the table, smiling through the light of the wax candles\nupon Herrick, would soon make him forget his love of \"Nature and\nNature's children.\" She even saw herself there, and this may have made\nher exhibit more interest in Herrick's experiment than she really felt.\nIn any event, Herrick found her most sympathetic' and when dinner was\nover carried her off to a corner of the terrace. It was a warm night in\nearly October, and the great woods of the game preserve that stretched\nbelow them were lit with a full moon.\n\nOn his way to the lake for a moonlight row with one of the house party\nwho belonged to that sex that does not row, but looks well in the\nmoon-light, Kelly halted, and jeered mockingly.\n\n\"How can you sit there,\" he demanded, \"while those poor beasts are\nfreezing in a cave, with not even a silk coverlet or a pillow-sham. You\nand your valet ought to be down there now carrying them pajamas.\"\n\n\"Kelly,\" declared Herrick, unruffled in his moment of triumph, \"I hate\nto say, 'I told you so,' but you force me. Go away,\" he commanded. \"You\nhave neither imagination nor soul.\"\n\n\"And that's true,\" he assured Miss Waring, as Kelly and his companion\nleft them. \"Now, I see nothing in what I accomplished that is\nridiculous. Had you watched those bears as I did, you would have felt\nthat sympathy that exists between all who love the out-of-door life. A\ndog loves to see his master pick up his stick and his hat to take him\nfor a walk, and the man enjoys seeing the dog leaping and quartering\nthe fields before him. They are both the happier. At least I am happier\nto-night, knowing those bears are at peace and at home, than I would\nbe if I thought of them being whipped through their tricks in a dirty\ntheatre.\" Herrick pointed to the great forest trees of the preserve,\ntheir tops showing dimly in the mist of moonlight. \"Somewhere, down in\nthat valley,\" he murmured, \"are three happy animals. They are no longer\nslaves and puppets--they are their own masters. For the rest of their\nlives they can sleep on pine needles and dine on nuts and honey. No one\nshall molest them, no one shall force them through degrading tricks.\nHereafter they can choose their life, and their own home among the\nrocks, and the----\" Herrick's words were frozen on his tongue. From the\nother end of the terrace came a scream so fierce, so long, so full of\nhuman suffering, that at the sound the blood of all that heard it turned\nto water. It was so appalling that for an instant no one moved, and then\nfrom every part of the house, along the garden walks, from the servants'\nquarters, came the sound of pounding feet. Herrick, with Miss Waring\nclutching at his sleeve, raced toward the other end of the terrace. They\nhad not far to go. Directly in front of them they saw what had dragged\nfrom the very soul of the woman the scream of terror.\n\nThe drawing-room opened upon the terrace, and, seated at the piano,\nJackson had been playing for those in the room to dance. The windows to\nthe terrace were open. The terrace itself was flooded with moonlight.\nSeeking the fresh air, one of the dancers stepped from the drawing-room\nto the flags outside. She had then raised the cry of terror and fallen\nin a faint. What she had seen, Herrick a moment later also saw. On the\nterrace in the moon-light, Bruno and Clara, on their hind legs, were\nsolemnly waltzing. Neither the scream nor the cessation of the music\ndisturbed them. Contentedly, proudly, they continued to revolve in hops\nand leaps. From their happy expression, it was evident they not only\nwere enjoying themselves, but that they felt they were greatly affording\nimmeasurable delight to others. Sick at heart, furious, bitterly hurt,\nwith roars of mocking laughter in his ears, Herrick ran toward the\nstables for help. At the farther end of the terrace the butler had\nplaced a tray of liqueurs, whiskeys, and soda bottles. His back had been\nturned for only a few moments, but the time had sufficed.\n\nLolling with his legs out, stretched in a wicker chair, Herrick beheld\nthe form of Ikey. Between his uplifted paws he held aloof the base of\na decanter; between his teeth, and well jammed down his throat, was the\nlong neck of the bottle. From it issued the sound of gentle gurgling.\nHerrick seized the decanter and hurled it crashing upon the terrace.\nWith difficulty Ikey rose. Swaying and shaking his head reproachfully,\nhe gave Herrick a perfectly accurate imitation of an intoxicated bear.",
