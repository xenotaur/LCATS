I am now making for home\nas fast as possible, and I have now nothing to detain me.\n\nSince I wrote to you last I have been again in quarantine for two days\nand a half at Trieste, but I am glad to say that I shall no longer be\ndetained on that account.  I was obliged to go to Trieste, though it was\nmuch out of my way, otherwise I must have remained I know not how long in\nCorfu, waiting for a direct conveyance.  After my liberation I only\nstopped a day at Corfu in order that I might lose no more time, though I\nreally wished to tarry there a little longer, the people were so kind.\nOn the day of my liberation I had four invitations to dinner from the\nofficers.  I, however, made the most of my time, and escorted by one,\nCaptain Northcott, of the Rifles, went over the fortifications, which are\nmost magnificent.  I saw everything that I well could, and shall never\nforget the kindness with which I was treated.  The next day I went for\nTrieste in a steamer, down the whole length of the Adriatic.  I was\nhorribly unwell, for the Adriatic is a bad sea, and very dangerous; the\nweather was also very rough.  After stopping at Trieste a day, besides\nthe quarantine, I left for Venice, and here I am, and hope to be on my\nroute again the day after to-morrow.  I shall now hurry through Italy by\nway of Ancona, Rome, and Civita Vecchia to Marseilles in France, and from\nMarseilles to London, in not more than six days' journey.  Oh, I shall be\nso glad to get back to you and my mother (I hope she is alive and well)\nand Hen. {7}\n\nI am glad to hear that we are not to have a war with those silly people,\nthe French.  The idea made me very uneasy, for I thought how near Oulton\nlay to the coast.\n\nYou cannot imagine what a magnificent old town Venice is--it is clearly\nthe finest in Italy, although in decay; it stands upon islands in the\nsea, and in many places is intersected with canals.  The Grand Canal is\nfour miles long, lined with palaces on either side.  I, however, shall be\nglad to leave it, for there is no place to me like Oulton, where live two\nof my dear ones.  I have told you that I am very tired, so that I cannot\nwrite much more, and I am presently going to bed, but I am sure that you\nwill be glad to hear from me however little I may write.\n\nI think I told you in my last letter that I had been to the top of Mount\nOlympus, in Thessaly.  Tell Hen that I saw a whole herd of wild deer\nbounding down the cliffs, the noise they made was like thunder.  I also\nsaw an enormous eagle--one of Jupiter's birds, his real eagles, for\naccording to the Grecian mythology Olympus was his favourite haunt.  I\ndon't know what it was then, but at present it is the most wild, savage\nplace I ever saw; an immense way up I came to a forest of pines; half of\nthem were broken by thunder-bolts, snapped in the middle, and the ruins\nlying around in the most hideous confusion; some had been blasted from\ntop to bottom and stood naked, black, and charred, in indescribable\nhorridness.  Jupiter was the god of thunder, and he still seems to haunt\nOlympus.  The worst is there is little water, so that a person might\nalmost perish there of thirst: the snow-water, however, when it runs into\nthe hollows is the most delicious beverage ever tasted--the snow,\nhowever, is very high up.  My next letter I hope will be from Marseilles,\nand I hope to be there in a very few days.\n\nNow, God bless you, my dearest.  Write to my mother, and kiss Hen, and\nremember me kindly to Lucy and the Atkinses.\n\n                                                              G. B[ORROW].\n\n\n\nLETTER II.\n\n\n                                                            53A PALL MALL,\n                                                        _Saturday_ [1854].\n\nDEAR CARRETA,\n\nI am thinking of coming to you on Thursday.  I do not know that I can do\nanything more here, and the dulness of the weather, and the mists, are\nmaking me ill.\n\nPlease to send another five pound note by Tuesday morning.  I have spent\nscarcely anything of that which you sent, except what I owe to Mrs. W.,\nbut I wish to have money in my pocket, and Murray and Cooke are going to\ndine with me on Tuesday.\n\nI shall be glad to be with you again, for I am very much in want of your\nsociety.  I miss very much my walks at Llangollen by the quiet canal; but\nwhat's to be done?\n\nEverything seems nearly at a standstill in London on account of this\nwretched war, at which it appears to me the English are getting the\nworst, notwithstanding their boasting.  They thought to settle it in an\nautumn's day; they little knew the Russians, and they did not reflect\nthat just after autumn comes winter, which has ever been the Russian's\nfriend.\n\nHave you heard anything about the rent of the cottage?  I should have\nbeen glad to hear from you this morning.\n\nGive my love to Hen, and may God bless you, dear.\n\n                                                            GEORGE BORROW.\n\nKeep this.\n\n\n\nLETTER III.\n\n\n                                                                     TENBY\n                                           _Tuesday_, 25 [_August_, 1857].\n\nMY DEAR CARRETA,\n\nSince writing to you I have been rather unwell, and was obliged to remain\ntwo days at Sandypool.  The weather has been terribly hot, and affected\nmy head, and likewise my sight slightly.  Moreover, one of the shoes hurt\nmy foot.  I came to this place to-day, and shall presently leave it for\nPembroke on my way back.  I shall write to you from there.  I shall\nreturn by Cardigan.\n\nWhat I want you to do is to write to me directed to the post office,\nCardigan (in Cardiganshire), and either inclose a post office order for\nfive pounds, or an order from Lloyd and Co. on the Banker of that place\nfor the same sum.  But at any rate write, or I shall not know what to do.\nI would return by railroad, but in that event I must go to London, for\nthere are no railroads from here to Shrewsbury.  I want, moreover, to see\na little more.\n\nJust speak to the Banker, and don't lose any time.  Send letter, and\neither order in it, or say that I can get it at the Banker's.\n\nI hope all is well.  God bless you and Hen.\n\n                                                            GEORGE BORROW.\n\n\n\nLETTER IV.\n\n\n                                                                  LAMPETER\n                                                _September_ 3_rd_, [1857].\n\nMY DEAR CARRETA,\n\nI am making the best of my way to Shrewsbury (my face is turned towards\nMama).  I write this from Lampeter, where there is a college for\neducating clergymen intended for Wales, which I am going to see.  I shall\nthen start for Radnor by Tregavon, and hope soon to be in England.\n\nI have seen an enormous deal since I have been away, and have walked\nseveral hundred miles.  Amongst other places I have seen St. David's, a\nwonderful half-ruinous Cathedral at the western end of Pembrokeshire; but\nI shall be glad to get back.\n\n                                                    God bless you and Hen,\n                                                            GEORGE BORROW.\n\nHenrietta!  Do you know who is handsome?\n\n\n\nLETTER V.\n\n\n                                                                EDINBURGH,\n                                      _Sunday_ [_September_ 19_th_, 1858].\n\nDEAR CARRETA,\n\nI just write a line to inform you that I arrived here yesterday quite\nsafe.\n\nWe did not start from Yarmouth till past three o'clock on Thursday\nmorning; we reached Newcastle about ten on Friday.  As I was walking in\nthe street at Newcastle a sailor-like man came running up to me, and\nbegged that I would let him speak to me.  He appeared almost wild with\njoy.  I asked him who he was, and he told me he was a Yarmouth north\nbeach man, and that he knew me very well.  Before I could answer, another\nsailor-like, short, thick fellow came running up, who also seemed wild\nwith joy; he was a comrade of the other.  I never saw two people so out\nof themselves with pleasure, they literally danced in the street; in\nfact, they were two of my old friends.  I asked them how they came down\nthere, and they told me that they had been down fishing.  They begged a\nthousand pardons for speaking to me, but told me they could not help it.\n\nI set off for Alnwick on Friday afternoon, stayed there all night, and\nsaw the castle next morning.  It is a fine old place, but at present is\nundergoing repairs--a Scottish king was killed before its walls in the\nold time.  At about twelve I started for Edinburgh.  The place is\nwonderfully altered since I was here, and I don't think for the better.\nThere is a Runic stone on the castle brae which I am going to copy.  It\nwas not there in my time.\n\nIf you write direct to me at the Post Office, Inverness.  I am thinking\nof going to Glasgow to-morrow, from which place I shall start for\nInverness by one of the packets which go thither by the North-West and\nthe Caledonian Canal.  I hope that you and Hen are well and comfortable.\nPray eat plenty of grapes and partridges.  We had upon the whole a\npleasant passage from Yarmouth; we lived plainly but well, and I was not\nat all ill--the captain seemed a kind, honest creature.\n\nRemember me kindly to Mrs. Turnour and Mrs. Clarke, and God bless you and\nHen.\n\n                                                            GEORGE BORROW.\n\n\n\nLETTER VI.\n\n\n                                                                INVERNESS,\n                                      _Sunday_ [_September_ 26_th_, 1858].\n\nDEAR CARRETA,\n\nThis is the third letter which I have written to you.  Whether you have\nreceived the other two, or will receive this, I am doubtful.  I have been\nseveral times to the post office, but we found no letter from you, though\nI expected to find one awaiting me when I arrived.  I wrote last on\nFriday.  I merely want to know once how you are, and if all is well I\nshall move onward.  It is of not much use staying here.\n\nAfter I had written to you on Friday I crossed by the ferry over the\nFirth and walked to Beauly, and from thence to Beaufort or Castle Downie.\nAt Beauly I saw the gate of the pit where old Fraser used to put the\npeople whom he owed money to--it is in the old ruined cathedral, and at\nBeaufort saw the ruins of the house where he was born.  Lord Lovat lives\nin the house close by.  There is now a claimant to the title, a\ndescendant of old Fraser's elder brother who committed a murder in the\nyear 1690, and on that account fled to South Wales.  The present family\nare rather uneasy, and so are their friends, of whom they have a great\nnumber, for though they are flaming Papists they are very free of their\nmoney.  I have told several of their cousins that the claimant has not a\nchance as the present family have been so long in possession.  They\nalmost blessed me for saying so.  There, however, can be very little\ndoubt that the title and estate, more than a million acres, belong to the\nclaimant by strict law.  Old Fraser's brother was called Black John of\nthe Tasser.  The man whom he killed was a piper who sang an insulting\nsong to him at a wedding.  I have heard the words and have translated\nthem; he was dressed very finely, and the piper sang:\n\n    _You're dressed in Highland robes_, _O John_,\n       _But ropes of straw would become ye better_;\n    _You've silver buckles your shoes upon_\n       _But leather thongs for them were fitter_.\n\nWhereupon John drew his dagger and ran it into the piper's belly; the\ndescendants of the piper are still living at Beauly.  I walked that day\nthirty-four miles between noon and ten o'clock at night.  My letter of\ncredit is here.  This is a dear place, but not so bad as Edinburgh.  _If\nyou have written_, don't write any more till you hear from me again.\n\n                                                    God bless you and Hen.\n                                                            GEORGE BORROW.\n\n\n\nLETTER VII.\n\n\n                                                                INVERNESS,\n                                               _September_ 30_th_, [1858].\n\nDEAR CARRETA,\n\nI write another line to tell you that I have got your second letter--it\ncame just in time, as I leave to-morrow.  In your next, address to George\nBorrow, Post Office, Tobermory, Isle of Mull, Scotland.  You had,\nhowever, better write without delay, as I don't know how long I may be\nthere; and be sure only to write once.  I am glad we have got such a\ndesirable tenant for our Maltings, and should be happy to hear that the\ncottage was also let so well.  However, let us be grateful for what has\nbeen accomplished.\n\nI hope you wrote to Cooke as I desired you, and likewise said something\nabout how I had waited for Murray.  Between ourselves that account of\ntheirs was a shameful one, whatever they may say.\n\nI met to-day a very fat gentleman from Caithness, at the very north of\nScotland; he said he was descended from the Norse.  I talked to him about\nthem, and he was so pleased with my conversation that he gave me his\ncard, and begged that I would visit him if I went there.  As I could do\nno less, I showed him my card--I had but one--and he no sooner saw the\nname than he was in a rapture.\n\nI am rather glad that you have got the next door, as the locality is\nhighly respectable.  Tell Hen that I copied the Runic stone on the Castle\nHill, Edinburgh.  It was brought from Denmark in the old time.  The\ninscription is imperfect, but I can read enough of it to see that it was\nerected by a man to his father and mother.  I again write the direction\nfor your next: _George Borrow_, _Esq._, _Post Office_, _Tobermory_, _Isle\nof Mull_, _Scotland_.\n\nGod bless you and Hen.\n\n                                                               Ever yours,\n                                                            GEORGE BORROW.\n\n\n\nLETTER VIII.\n\n\n                                                            FORT AUGUSTUS,\n                                        _Sunday_, _October_ 7_th_, [1858].\n\nDEAR CARRETA,\n\nI write a line lest you should be uneasy.  Before leaving the Highlands I\nthought I would see a little more about me.  So last week I set on a four\ndays' task, a walk of a hundred miles.  I returned here late last\nThursday night.  I walked that day forty-five miles; during the first\ntwenty the rain poured in torrents, and the wind blew in my face.  The\nlast seventeen miles were in the dark.  To-morrow I proceed towards Mull.\n\nI hope that you got my letters, and that I shall find something from you\nawaiting me at the post office.  The first day I passed over Corryarrick,\na mountain 3000 feet high.  I was nearly up to my middle in snow.  As\nsoon as I had passed it I was on Badenoch.  The road on the farther side\nwas horrible, and I was obliged to wade several rivulets, one of which\nwas very boisterous and nearly threw me down.  I wandered through a\nwonderful country, and picked up a great many strange legends from the\npeople I met, but they were very few, the country being almost a desert,\nchiefly inhabited by deer.  When amidst the lower mountains I frequently\nheard them blaring in the woods above me.  The people at the inn here are\nby far the nicest I have met; they are kind and honourable to a degree.\n\n                                                    God bless you and Hen.\n                                                            GEORGE BORROW.\n\nDon't write again if you have written.\n\n\n\nLETTER IX.\n\n\n                                                                INVERNESS,\n                                                 _November_ 7_th_, [1858].\n\nDEAR CARRETA,\n\nAfter I wrote to you I walked round Mull and through it, over Benmore.  I\nlikewise went to Icolmkill, and passed twenty-four hours there.  I saw\nthe wonderful ruin and crossed the island.  I suffered a great deal from\nhunger, but what I saw amply repaid me; on my return to Tobermory I was\nrather unwell, but got better.  I was disappointed in a passage to Thurso\nby sea, so I was obliged to return to this place by train.  On Tuesday,\nD.V., I shall set out on foot, and hope to find your letter awaiting me\nat the post office at Thurso.\n\nOn coming hither by train I nearly lost my things.  I was told at Huntly\nthat the train stopped ten minutes, and meanwhile the train drove off\n_purposely_.  I telegraphed to Keith in order that my things might be\nsecured, describing where they were, under the seat.  The reply was that\nthere was nothing of the kind there.  I instantly said that I would bring\nan action against the company, and walked off to the town, where I stated\nthe facts to a magistrate, and gave him my name and address.  He advised\nme to bring my action.  I went back and found the people frightened.\nThey telegraphed again--and the reply was that the things were safe.\nThere is nothing like setting oneself up sometimes.  I was terribly\nafraid I should never again find my books and things.  I, however, got\nthem, and my old umbrella, too.  I was sent on by the mail train, but\nlost four hours, besides undergoing a great deal of misery and\nexcitement.\n\nWhen I have been to Thurso and Kirkwall I shall return as quick as\npossible, and shall be glad to get out of the country.  As I am here,\nhowever, I wish to see all I can, for I never wish to return.  Whilst in\nMull I lived very cheaply--it is not costing me more than seven shillings\na day.  The generality of the inns, however, in the lowlands are\nincredibly dear--half-a-crown for breakfast, consisting of a little tea,\na couple of small eggs, and bread and butter--_two_ shillings for\nattendance.  Tell Hen that I have some moss for her from Benmore--also\nsome seaweed from the farther shore of Icolmrill.  God bless you,\n\n                                                            GEORGE BORROW.\n\n\n\nLETTER X.\n\n\n                                                                   THURSO,\n                                                _November_ 21_st_, [1858].\n\nMY DEAR CARRETA,\n\nI reached this place on Friday night, and was glad enough to get your\nkind letter.  I shall be so glad to get home to you.\n\nSince my last letter to you I have walked nearly 160 miles.  I was\nterribly taken in with respect to distances--however, I managed to make\nmy way.  I have been to Johnny Groat's House, which is about twenty-two\nmiles from this place.  I had tolerably fine weather all the way, but\nwithin two or three miles of that place a terrible storm arose; the next\nday the country was covered with ice and snow.  There is at present here\na kind of Greenland winter, colder almost than I ever knew the winter in\nRussia.  The streets are so covered with ice that it is dangerous to step\nout.  To-morrow D. and I pass over into Orkney, and we shall take the first\nsteamer to Aberdeen and Inverness, from whence I shall make the best of\nmy way to England.  It is well that I have no farther to walk, for\nwalking now is almost impossible--the last twenty miles were terrible,\nand the weather is worse than it was then.  I was terribly deceived with\nrespect to steamboats.  I was told that one passed over to Orkney every\nday, and I have now been waiting two days, and there is not yet one.  I\nhave had quite enough of Scotland.  When I was at Johnny Groat's I got a\nshell for dear Hen, which I hope I shall be able to bring or send to her.\n\nI am glad to hear that you have got out the money on mortgage so\nsatisfactorily.  One of the greatest blessings in this world is to be\nindependent.  My spirits of late have been rather bad, owing principally\nto my dear mother's death.  I always knew that we should miss her.  I\ndreamt about her at Fort Augustus.  Though I have walked so much I have\nsuffered very little from fatigue, and have got over the ground with\nsurprising facility, but I have not enjoyed the country so much as Wales.\n\nI wish that you would order a hat for me against I come home; the one I\nam wearing is very shabby, having been so frequently drenched with rain\nand storm-beaten.  I cannot say the exact day that I shall be home, but\nyou may be expecting me.  The worst is that there is no depending on the\nsteamers, for there is scarcely any traffic in Scotland in winter.  My\nappetite of late has been very poorly, chiefly, I believe, owing to\nbadness of food and want of regular meals.  Glad enough, I repeat, shall\nI be to get home to you and Hen.\n\n                                                            GEORGE BORROW.\n\n\n\nLETTER XI.\n\n\n                                                         KIRKWALL, ORKNEY,\n                                     _November_ 27_th_, _Saturday_ [1858].\n\nDEAR CARRETA,\n\nI am, as you see, in Orkney, and I expect every minute the steamer which\nwill take me to Shetland and Aberdeen, from which last place I go by\ntrain to Inverness, where my things are, and thence home.\n\nI had a stormy passage to Stromness, from whence I took a boat to the\nIsle of Hoy, where I saw the wonderful Dwarf's House hollowed out of the\nstone.  From Stromness I walked here.  I have seen the old Norwegian\nCathedral; it is of red sandstone, and looks as if cut out of rock.  It\nis different from almost everything of the kind I ever saw.  It is stern\nand grand to a degree.  I have also seen the ruins of the old Norwegian\nBishop's palace in which King Hacon died; also the ruins of the palace of\nPatrick, Earl of Orkney.  I have been treated here with every kindness\nand civility.  As soon as the people knew who I was they could scarcely\nmake enough of me.  The Sheriff, Mr. Robertson, a great Gaelic scholar,\nsaid he was proud to see me in his house; and a young gentleman of the\nname of Petrie, Clerk of Supply, has done nothing but go about with me to\nshow me the wonders of the place.  Mr. Robertson wished to give me\nletters to some gentleman at Edinburgh.  I, however, begged leave to be\nexcused, saying that I wished to get home, as, indeed, I do, for my mind\nis wearied by seeing so many strange places.  On my way to Kirkwall I saw\nthe stones of Stennis--immense blocks of stone standing up like those of\nSalisbury Plain.  All the country is full of Druidical and Pictish\nremains.  It is, however, very barren, and scarcely a tree is to be seen,\nonly a few dwarf ones.  Orkney consists of a multitude of small islands,\nthe principal of which is Pomona, in which Kirkwall is.  The currents\nbetween them are terrible.\n\nI hope to be home a few days after you receive these lines, either by\nrail or steamer.  This is a fine day, but there has been dreadful weather\nhere.  I hope we shall have a prosperous passage.  I have purchased a\nlittle Kirkwall newspaper, which I send you with this letter.  I shall\nperhaps post both at Lerwick or Aberdeen.  I sent you a Johnny Groat's\nnewspaper, which I hope you got.  Don't tear either up, for they are\ncurious.\n\n                                                    God bless you and Hen.\n                                                            GEORGE BORROW.\n\n\n\nLETTER XII.\n\n\n                                                                 STIRLING,\n                                                _December_ 14_th_, [1858].\n\nDEAR CARRETA,\n\nI write a line to tell you that I am well, and that I am on my way to\nEngland, but I am stopped here for a day, for there is no conveyance.\nWherever I can walk I get on very well--but if you depend on coaches or\nany means of conveyance in this country you are sure to be disappointed.\nThis place is but thirty-five miles from Edinburgh, yet I am detained for\na day--there is no train.  The waste of that day will prevent me getting\nto Yarmouth from Hull by the steamer.  Were it not for my baggage I would\nwalk to Edinburgh.  I got to Aberdeen, where I posted a letter for you.\nI was then obliged to return to Inverness for my luggage--125 miles.\nRather than return again to Aberdeen, I sent on my things to Dunkeld, and\nwalked the 102 miles through the Highlands.  When I got here I walked to\nLoch Lomond and Loch Katrine, thirty-eight miles over horrible roads.  I\nthen got back here.  I have now seen the whole of Scotland that is worth\nseeing, and have walked 600 miles.  I shall be glad to be out of the\ncountry; a person here must depend entirely upon himself and his own\nlegs.  I have not spent much money--my expenses during my wanderings\naveraged a shilling a day.\n\nAs I was walking through Strathspey, singularly enough I met two or three\nof the Phillips.  I did not know them, but a child came running after me\nto ask me my name.  It was Miss P. and two of the children.  I hope to\nget to you in two or three days after you get this.\n\n                                               God bless you and dear Hen.\n                                                            GEORGE BORROW.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n                                 LONDON:\n               Printed for THOMAS J.
