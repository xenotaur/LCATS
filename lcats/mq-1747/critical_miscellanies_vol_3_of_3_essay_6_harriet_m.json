She is\nnot a person to be judged by her writings alone, but rather by her own\ndeeds and life, than which nothing can be more exemplary or noble.'\n\nThe division which Miss Bronte thus makes between opinions and\ncharacter, and again between literary production and character, is at\nthe root of any just criticism of the two volumes of autobiography which\nhave just been given to the public. Of the third volume, _The\nMemorials_, by Mrs. Chapman, it is impossible to say anything serious.\nMrs. Chapman fought an admirable fight in the dark times of American\nhistory for the abolition of slavery, but unhappily she is without\nliterary gifts; and this third volume is one more illustration of the\nfolly of entrusting the composition of biography to persons who have\nonly the wholly irrelevant claim of intimate friendship, or kinship, or\nsympathy in public causes. The qualification for a biographer is not in\nthe least that he is a virtuous person, or a second cousin, or a dear\nfriend, or a trusty colleague; but that he knows how to write a book,\nhas tact, style, taste, considerateness, sense of proportion, and a good\neye for the beginnings and ends of things. The third volume, then, tells\nus little about the person to whom they relate. The two volumes of\nautobiography tell all that we can seek to know, and the reader who\njudges them in an equitable spirit will be ready to allow that, when all\nis said that can be said of her hardness, arbitrariness, and insularity,\nHarriet Martineau is still a singular and worthy figure among the\nconspicuous personages of a generation that has now almost vanished.\nSome will wonder how it was that her literary performances acquired so\nlittle of permanent value. Others will be pained by the distinct\nrepudiation of all theology, avowed by her with a simple and courageous\ndirectness that can scarcely be counted other than honourable to her.\nBut everybody will admit, as Charlotte Bronte did, that though her books\nare not of the first nor of the second rank, and though her\nanti-theological opinions are to many so repugnant, yet behind books and\nopinions was a remarkable personality, a sure eye for social realities,\na moral courage that never flinched; a strong judgment within its\nlimits; a vigorous self-reliance both in opinion and act, which yet did\nnot prevent a habit of the most neutral self-judgment; the commonplace\nvirtues of industry and energy devoted to aims too elevated, and too\nlarge and generous, to be commonplace; a splendid sincerity, a\nmagnificent love of truth. And that all these fine qualities, which\nwould mostly be described as manly, should exist not in a man but a\nwoman, and in a woman who discharged admirably such feminine duties as\nfell to her, fills up the measure of our interest in such a character.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nHarriet Martineau was born at Norwich in 1802, and she died, as we all\nremember, in the course of the summer of 1876. Few people have lived so\nlong as three-quarters of a century, and undergone so little substantial\nchange of character, amid some very important changes of opinion. Her\nfamily was Unitarian, and family life was in her case marked by some of\nthat stiffness, that severity, that chilly rigour, with which Unitarians\nare sometimes taxed by religionists of a more ecstatic doctrine. Her\nchildhood was very unhappy; the household seems to have been unamiable,\nand she was treated with none of that tenderness and sympathy for which\nfirm and defiant natures are apt to yearn as strongly as others that get\nthe credit of greater sensibility. With that singular impulse to suicide\nwhich is frequent among children, though rarer with girls than boys, she\nwent one day into the kitchen for the carving-knife, that she might cut\nher throat; luckily the servants were at dinner, and the child\nretreated. Deafness, which proved incurable, began to afflict her\nbefore she was sixteen. A severe, harsh, and mournful kind of\nreligiosity seized her, and this 'abominable spiritual rigidity,' as she\ncalls it, confirmed all the gloomy predispositions of her mind. She\nlearned a good deal, mastering Latin, French, and Italian in good time;\nand reading much in her own tongue, including constant attention to the\nBible, with all sorts of commentaries and explanations, such as those of\nus who were brought up in a certain spiritual atmosphere have only too\ngood reasons never to forget. This expansion of intellectual interest,\nhowever, did not make her less silent, less low in her spirits, less\nfull of vague and anxious presentiment. The reader is glad when these\nungracious years of youth are at an end, and the demands of active life\nstirred Harriet Martineau's energies into vigorous work.\n\nIn 1822 her father died, and seven years later his widow and his\ndaughters lost at a single blow nearly all that they had in the world.\nBefore this event, which really proved to be a blessing in the disguise\nof a catastrophe, Harriet Martineau had written a number of slight\npieces. They had been printed, and received a certain amount of\nrecognition. They were of a religious cast, as was natural in one with\nwhom religious literature, and religious life and observance, had\nhitherto taken in the whole sphere of her continual experience.\n_Traditions of Palestine_ and _Devotional Exercises_ are titles that\ntell their own tale, and we may be sure that their authoress was still\nat the antipodean point of the positive philosophy in which she ended\nher speculative journey. She still clung undoubtingly to what she had\nbeen brought up to believe when she won three prizes for essays intended\nto present Unitarianism to the notice of Jews, of Catholics, and of\nMahometans. Her success in these and similar efforts turned her mind\nmore decidedly towards literature as a profession.\n\nMiss Martineau is at some pains to assure us on several occasions that\nit was the need of utterance now and always that drove her to write, and\nthat money, although welcome when it came, was never her motive. This\nperhaps a little savours of affectation. Nobody would dream of\nsuspecting Miss Martineau of writing anything that she did not believe\nto be true or useful merely for the sake of money. But there is plenty\nof evidence that the prospect of payment stirred her to true and useful\nwork, as it does many other authors by profession, and as it does the\nfollowers of all professions whatever. She puts the case fairly enough\nin another place (i. 422):--'Every author is in a manner an adventurer;\nand no one was ever more decidedly so than myself; but the difference\nbetween one kind of adventurer and another is, I believe, simply\nthis--that the one has something to say which presses for utterance, and\nis uttered at length without a view to future fortunes; while the other\nhas a sort of general inclination towards literature, without any\nspecific need of utterance, and a very definite desire for the honours\nand rewards of the literary career.' Even in the latter case, however,\nhonest journeyman's work enough is done in literature by men and women\nwho seek nothing higher than a reputable source of income. Miss\nMartineau did, no doubt, seek objects far higher and more generous than\nincome, but she lived on the income which literature brought to her; and\nthere seems a certain failure of her usually admirable common sense in\nmaking any ado about so simple a matter. When doctors and counsel refuse\ntheir guineas, and the parson declines a stipend, it will be quite soon\nenough for the author to be especially anxious to show that he has a\nright to regard money much as the rest of the human race regard it.\n\nMiss Martineau underwent the harsh ordeal which awaits most literary\naspirants. She had a scheme in her head for a long series of short tales\nto illustrate some of the propositions of political economy. She trudged\nabout London day after day, through mud and fog, with weary limbs and\nanxious heart, as many an author has done before and since. The times\nwere bad; cholera was abroad; people were full of apprehension and\nconcern about the Reform Bill; and the publishers looked coldly on a\ndoubtful venture. Miss Martineau talks none of the conventional nonsense\nabout the cruelty and stupidity of publishers. What she says is this: 'I\nhave always been anxious to extend to young or struggling authors the\nsort of aid which would have been so precious to me in that winter of\n1829-1830, and I know that, in above twenty years, I have never\nsucceeded but once.' One of the most distinguished editors in London,\nwho had charge of a periodical for many years, told us what comes to the\nsame thing, namely, that in no single case during all these years did a\nvolunteer contributor of real quality, or with any promise of eminence,\npresent himself or herself. So many hundreds think themselves called so\nfew are chosen. In Miss Martineau's case, however, the trade made a\nmistake. When at length she found some one to go halves with her in the\nenterprise, on terms extremely disadvantageous to herself, the first of\nher tales was published (1832), and instantly had a prodigious success.\nThe sale ran up to more than ten thousand of each monthly volume. In\nthat singular autobiographical sketch of herself which Miss Martineau\nprepared for a London paper, to be printed as her obituary notice, she\npronounced a judgment upon this work which more disinterested, though\nnot more impartial, critics will confirm. Her own unalterable view, she\nsays, of what the work could and could not effect, 'prevented her from\nexpecting too much from it, either in regard to its social operations or\nits influence on her own fame. The original idea of exhibiting the great\nnatural laws of society by a series of pictures of selected social\naction was a fortunate one; and her tales initiated a multitude of minds\ninto the conception of what political economy is, and how it concerns\neverybody living in society. Beyond this there is no merit of a high\norder in the work. It popularised in a fresh form some doctrines and\nmany truths long before made public by others.' James Mill, one of the\nacutest economists of the day, and one of the most vigorous and original\ncharacters of that or any other day, had foretold failure; but when the\ntime came, he very handsomely admitted that his prophecy had been rash.\nIn after years, when Miss Martineau had acquired from Comte a conception\nof the growth and movement of societies as a whole, with their economic\nconditions controlled and constantly modified by a multitude of other\nconditions of various kinds, she rated the science of her earlier days\nvery low. Even in those days, however, she says: 'I believe I should not\nhave been greatly surprised or displeased to have perceived, even then,\nthat the pretended science is no science at all, strictly speaking; and\nthat so many of its parts must undergo essential change, that it may be\na question whether future generations will owe much more to it than the\nbenefit (inestimable, to be sure) of establishing the grand truth that\nsocial affairs proceed according to general laws, no less than natural\nphenomena of every kind' (_Autob._ ii. 245).\n\nHarriet Martineau was not of the class of writers, most of them terribly\nunprofitable, who merely say literary things about social organisation,\nits institutions, and their improvement. Her feeling about society was\nless literary than scientific: it was not sentimental, but the\nbusiness-like quality of a good administrator. She was moved less by\npity or by any sense of the pathos and the hardness of the world, than\nby a sensible and energetic interest in good government and in the\nrational and convenient ordering of things. Her tales to illustrate the\ntruths of political economy are what might be expected from a writer of\nthis character. They are far from being wanting--many of them--in the\ngenuine interest of good story-telling. They are rapid, definite, and\nwithout a trace of either slovenliness or fatigue. We are amazed as we\nthink of the speed and prompt regularity with which they were produced;\nand the fertile ingenuity with which the pill of political economy is\nwrapped up in the confectionery of a tale, may stand as a marvel of true\ncleverness and inventive dexterity. Of course, of imagination or\ninvention in a high sense there is not a trace. Such a quality was not\nin the gifts of the writer, nor could it in any case have worked within\nsuch limitations as those set by the matter and the object of the\nseries.\n\nLiterary success was followed in the usual order by social temptation.\nMiss Martineau removed from Norwich to London, and she had good reasons\nfor making the change. Her work dealt with matters of a political kind,\nand she could only secure a real knowledge of what was best worth saying\nby intercourse with those who had a better point of view for a survey of\nthe social state of England than could be found in a provincial town\nlike Norwich. So far as evening parties went, Miss Martineau soon\nperceived how little 'essential difference there is between the extreme\ncase of a cathedral city and that of literary London, or any other\nplace, where dissipation takes the turn of book-talk instead of dancing\nor masquerading.' She went out to dinner every night except Sundays, and\nsaw all the most interesting people of the London of five-and-forty\nyears ago. While she was free from presumptuousness in her judgments,\nshe was just as free from a foolish willingness to take the reputations\nof her hour on trust. Her attitude was friendly and sensible, but it was\nat the same time critical and independent; and that is what every frank,\nupright, and sterling character naturally becomes in face of an\nunfamiliar society. Harriet Martineau was too keen-sighted, too aware of\nthe folly and incompetent pretension of half the world, too consciously\nself-respecting and proud, to take society and its ways with any\ndiffidence or ingenuous simplicity. On the importance of the small\n_litterateur_ who unreasonably thinks himself a great one, on the airs\nand graces of the gushing blue-stockings who were in vogue in that day,\non the detestable vulgarity of literary lionising, she had no mercy. She\nrecounts with caustic relish the story about a certain pedantical lady,\nof whom Tierney had said that there was not another head in England that\ncould encounter hers on the subject of Cause and Effect. The story was\nthat when in a country house one fine day she took her seat in a window,\nsaying in a business-like manner (to David Ricardo): 'Come now, let us\nhave a little discussion about Space.' We remember a story about a\ncertain Mademoiselle de Launay, afterwards well known to the Paris of\nthe eighteenth century, being introduced at Versailles by a silly great\nlady who had an infatuation for her. 'This,' the great lady kept saying,\n'is the young person whom I have told you about, who is so wonderfully\nintelligent, who knows so much. Come, Mademoiselle, pray talk. Now,\nMadame, you will see how she talks. Well, first of all, now talk a\nlittle about religion; then you can tell us about something else.'\n\nWe cannot wonder that Miss Martineau did not go a second time to the\nhouse where Space might be the unprovoked theme of a casual chat.\nPretension in every shape she hated most heartily. Her judgments in most\ncases were thoroughly just--at this period of her life at any rate--and\nsometimes even unexpectedly kindly; and the reason is that she looked at\nsociety through the medium of a strong and penetrating kind of common\nsense, which is more often the gift of clever women than of clever men.\nIf she is masculine, she is, like Mrs. Colonel Poyntz, in one of\nBulwer's novels, 'masculine in a womanly way.' There is a real spirit of\nethical divination in some of her criticism of character. Take the\ndistinguished man whose name we have just written. 'There was Bulwer on\na sofa,' she says, 'sparkling and languishing among a set of female\nvotaries--he and they dizened out, perfumed, and presenting the nearest\npicture to a seraglio to be seen on British ground--only the\nindifference or hauteur of the lord of the harem being absent.' Yet this\ndisagreeable sight does not prevent her from feeling a cordial interest\nin him, amidst any amount of vexation and pity for his weakness. 'He\nseems to be a woman of genius inclosed by misadventure in a man's form.\nHe has insight, experience, sympathy, letters, power and grace of\nexpression, and an irrepressible impulse to utterance, and industry\nwhich should have produced works of the noblest quality; and these have\nbeen intercepted by mischiefs which may be called misfortune rather than\nfault. His friendly temper, his generous heart, his excellent\nconversation (at his best), and his simple manners (when he forgot\nhimself), have many a time 'left me mourning' that such a being should\nallow himself to sport with perdition.' Those who knew most about Bulwer,\nand who were most repelled by his terrible faults, will feel in this\npage of Miss Martineau's the breath of social equity in which charity is\nnot allowed to blur judgment, nor moral disapproval to narrow, starve,\nand discolour vision into lost possibilities of character. And we may\nnote in passing how even here, in the mere story of the men and women\nwhom she met in London drawing-rooms, Harriet Martineau does not lose\nherself in gossip about individuals looked at merely in their individual\nrelations. It is not merely the 'blighting of promise nor the forfeiture\nof a career' that she deplores in the case of a Bulwer or a Brougham; it\nis 'the intercepting of national blessings.' If this view of natural\ngifts as a source of blessing to society, and not merely of power or\nfame to their privileged possessor, were more common than it is, the\nimpression which such a thought is calculated to make would be the\nhighest available protection against those blighted promises and\nforfeited careers, of which Brougham and Bulwer were only two out of a\ntoo vast host of examples.\n\nIt is the very fulness with which she is possessed by this large way of\nconceiving a life in its manifold relations to the service of the world,\nthat is the secret of Harriet Martineau's firm, clear, calm, and almost\nneutral way of judging both her own work and character and those of\nothers. By calm we do not mean that she was incapable of strong and\ndirect censure. Many of her judgments, both here and in her _Biographic\nSketches_, are stern; and some--like that on Macaulay, for instance--may\neven pass for harsh. But they are never the product of mere anger or\nheatedness, and it is a great blunder to suppose that reasoned severity\nis incompatible with perfect composure, or that calm is another name for\namiable vapidity.\n\n                        Thoericht ist's\n    In allen Stuecken billig sein; es heisst\n    Sein eigen Selbst zerstoeren.\n\nHer condemnation of the Whigs, for example, is as stringent and\noutspoken as condemnation can be; yet it is a deliberate and reasoned\njudgment, not a mere bitterness or prejudice. The Whigs were at that\nmoment, between 1832 and 1834, at the height of their authority,\npolitical, literary, and social. After a generation of misgovernment\nthey had been borne to power on the tide of national enthusiasm for\nparliamentary reform, and for all those improvements in our national\nlife to which parliamentary reform was no more than the first step. The\nharshness and darkness of the past generation were the measure of the\nhopes of the new time. These hopes, which were at least as strong in\nHarriet Martineau as in anybody then living, the Whigs were soon felt to\nhave cheated. She cannot forgive them. Speaking of John and Edward\nRomilly, 'they had virtuous projects,' she says, 'and had every hope of\nachieving service worthy of their father's fame; but their aspirations\nwere speedily tamed down--as all high aspirations _are_ lowered by Whig\ninfluences.' A certain peer is described as 'agreeable enough in society\nto those who are not very particular in regard to sincerity; and was, as\nChancellor of the Exchequer or anything else, as good a representative\nas could be found of the flippancy, conceit, and official helplessness\nand ignorance of the Whig administration.' Charles Knight started a new\nperiodical for the people under the patronage of the official Whigs.\n'But the poverty and perverseness of their ideas, and the insolence of\ntheir feelings, were precisely what might be expected by all who really\nknew that remarkably vulgar class of men. They purposed to lecture the\nworking classes, who were by far the wiser party of the two, in a\njejune, coaxing, dull, religious-tract sort of tone, and criticised and\ndeprecated everything like vigour, and a manly and genial tone of\naddress in the new publication, while trying to push in as contributors\neffete and exhausted writers and friends of their own, who knew about\nas much of the working classes of England as of those of Turkey.' This\nenergetic description, which belongs to the year 1848, gives us an\ninteresting measure of the distance that has been traversed during the\nlast thirty years. The workmen have acquired direct political power;\nthey have organised themselves into effective groups for industrial\npurposes; they have produced leaders of ability and sound judgment; and\nthe Whig who seeks their support must stoop or rise to talk a Radicalism\nthat would have amply satisfied even Harriet Martineau herself.\n\nThe source of this improvement in the society to which she bade\nfarewell, over that into which she had been born, is set down by Miss\nMartineau to the most remarkable literary genius with whom, during her\nresidence in London, she was brought into contact. 'What Wordsworth did\nfor poetry,' she says, 'in bringing us out of a conventional idea and\nmethod to a true and simple one, Carlyle has done for morality. He may\nbe himself the most curious opposition to himself--he may be the\ngreatest mannerist of his age while denouncing conventionalism--the\ngreatest talker while eulogising silence--the most woful complainer\nwhile glorifying fortitude--the most uncertain and stormy in mood, while\nholding forth serenity as the greatest good within the reach of man; but\nhe has nevertheless infused into the mind of the English nation a\nsincerity, earnestness, healthfulness, and courage which can be\nappreciated only by those who are old enough to tell what was our\nmorbid state when Byron was the representative of our temper, the\nClapham church of our religion, and the rotten-borough system of our\npolitical morality.' We have no quarrel with this account of the\ngreatest man of letters of our generation. But Carlyle has only been one\ninfluence among others. It is a far cry indeed from _Sartor Resartus_ to\nthe _Tracts for the Times_, yet they were both of them protests against\nthe same thing, both of them attempted answers to the same problem, and\nthe _Tracts_ perhaps did more than _Sartor_ to quicken spiritual life,\nto shatter 'the Clapham church,' and to substitute a mystic faith and\nnot unlovely hope for the frigid, hard, and mechanical lines of official\northodoxy on the one hand, and the egotism and sentimental despair of\nByronism on the other. There is a third school, too, and Harriet\nMartineau herself was no insignificant member of it, to which both the\ntemper and the political morality of our time have owed a deep debt; the\nschool of those utilitarian political thinkers who gave light rather\nthan heat, and yet by the intellectual force with which they insisted on\nthe right direction of social reform, also stirred the very impulse\nwhich made men desire social reform. The most illustrious of this body\nwas undoubtedly John Mill; because to accurate political science he\nadded a fervid and vibrating social sympathy, and a power of quickening\nit in the best minds of a scientific turn. It is odd, by the way, that\nMiss Martineau, while so lavish in deserved panegyric on Carlyle,\nshould be so grudging and disparaging in the case of Mill, with whom her\nintellectual affinities must have been closer than with any other of her\ncontemporaries. The translator of Comte's _Positive Philosophy_ had\nbetter reasons than most people for thinking well of the services of the\nauthor of the _System of Logic_: it was certainly the latter book which\ndid more than any other to prepare the minds of the English philosophic\npublic for the former.\n\nIt is creditable to Miss Martineau's breadth of sympathy that she should\nhave left on record the tribute of her admiration for Carlyle, for\nnobody has written so harshly as Carlyle on the subject which interested\nHarriet Martineau more passionately than any other events of her time.\nIn 1834 she had finished her series of illustrations of political\neconomy; her domestic life was fretted by the unreasonable exigences of\nher mother; London society had perhaps begun to weary her, and she felt\nthe need of a change of scene. The United States, with the old European\ninstitutions placed amid new conditions, were then as now a natural\nobject of interest to everybody with a keen feeling for social\nimprovement. So to the Western Republic Miss Martineau turned her face.\nShe had not been long in the States before she began to feel that the\nAbolitionists, at that moment a despised and persecuted handful of men\nand women, were the truly moral and regenerating party in the country.\nHarriet Martineau no sooner felt this conviction driving out her former\nprejudice against them as fanatical and impracticable, than she at once\nbore public testimony, at serious risk of every kind to herself, in\nfavour of the extreme Anti-Slavery agitators. And for thirty years she\nnever slackened her sympathy nor her energetic action on English public\nopinion, in this most vital matter of her time. She was guided not\nmerely by humanitarian disgust at the cruel and brutal abominations of\nslavery,--though we know no reason why this alone should not be a\nsufficient ground for turning Abolitionist,--but also on the more purely\npolitical ground of the cowardice, silence, corruption, and hypocrisy\nthat were engendered in the Free States by purchased connivance at the\npeculiar institution of the Slave States. Nobody has yet traced out the\nfull effect upon the national character of the Americans of all those\nyears of conscious complicity in slavery, after the moral iniquity of\nslavery had become clear to the inner conscience of the very men who\nignobly sanctioned the mobbing of Abolitionists.\n\nIn the summer of 1836 Miss Martineau returned to England, having added\nthis great question to the stock of her foremost objects of interest and\nconcern. Such additions, whether literary or social, are the best kind\nof refreshment that travel supplies. She published two books on America:\none of them abstract and quasi-scientific, _Society in America_; the\nother, _A Retrospect of Western Travel_, of a lighter and more purely\ndescriptive quality. Their success with the public was moderate, and in\nafter years she condemned them in very plain language, the first of them\nespecially as 'full of affectations and preachments.' Their only\nservice, and it was not inconsiderable, was the information which they\ncirculated as to the condition of slavery and of the country under it.\nWe do not suppose that they are worth reading at the present day, except\nfrom a historical point of view. But they are really good specimens of a\nkind of literature which is not abundant, and yet which is of the utmost\nvalue--we mean the record of the sociological observation of a country\nby a competent traveller, who stays long enough in the country, has\naccess to the right persons of all kinds, and will take pains enough to\nmature his judgments. It was a happy idea of O'Connell's to suggest that\nshe should go over to Ireland, and write such an account of that country\nas she had written of the United States. And we wish at this very hour\nthat some one as competent as Miss Martineau would do what O'Connell\nwished her to do. A similar request came to her from Milan: why should\nshe not visit Lombardy, and then tell Europe the true tale of Austrian\nrule?\n\nBut after her American journey Miss Martineau felt a very easily\nintelligible desire to change the literary field. For many years she had\nbeen writing almost entirely about fact: and the constraint of the\neffort to be always correct, and to bear without solicitude the\nquestioning of her correctness, had become burdensome. She felt the\ndanger of losing nerve and becoming morbidly fearful of criticism on\nthe one hand, and of growing narrow and mechanical about accuracy on the\nother. 'I longed inexpressibly,' she says, 'for the liberty of fiction,\nwhile occasionally doubting whether I had the power to use that freedom\nas I could have done ten years before.' The product of this new mental\nphase was _Deerbrook_, which was published in the spring of 1839.\n_Deerbrook_ is a story of an English country village, its petty feuds,\nits gentilities, its chances and changes of fortune. The influence of\nJane Austen's stories is seen in every chapter; but Harriet Martineau\nhad none of the easy flow, the pleasant humour, the light-handed irony\nof her model, any more than she had the energetic and sustained\nimaginative power of Charlotte or Emily Bronte. There is playfulness\nenough in _Deerbrook_, but it is too deliberate to remind us of the\ncrooning involuntary playfulness of _Pride and Prejudice_ or _Sense and\nSensibility_. _Deerbrook_ is not in the least a story with a moral; it\nis truly and purely a piece of art; yet we are conscious of the serious\nspirit of the social reformer as haunting the background, and only\nsurrendering the scene for reasons of its own. On the other hand, there\nis in _Deerbrook_ a gravity of moral reflection that Jane Austen,\nwhether wisely or unwisely, seldom or never attempts. In this respect\n_Deerbrook_ is the distant forerunner of some of George Eliot's most\ncharacteristic work. Distant, because George Eliot's moralising is\nconstantly suffused by the broad light of a highly poetic imagination,\nand this was in no degree among Miss Martineau's gifts. Still there is\nsomething above the flat touch of the common didactic in such a page as\nthat in which (chapter xix.) she describes the case of 'the\nunamiable--the only order of evil ones who suffer hell without seeing\nand knowing that it is hell: nay, they are under a heavier curse than\neven this, they inflict torments second only to their own, with an\nunconsciousness worthy of spirits of light.' However, when all is said,\nwe may agree that this is one of the books that give a rational person\npleasure once, but which we hardly look forward to reading again.\n\nShortly after the publication of her first novel, Miss Martineau was\nseized by a serious internal malady, from which recovery seemed\nhopeless. According to her usual practice of taking her life\ndeliberately in her hands, and settling its conditions for herself,\ninstead of letting things drift as they might, she insisted on declining\nthe hospitable shelter pressed upon her by a near relative, on the\nexcellent ground that it is wrong for an invalid to impose restraints\nupon a healthy household. She proceeded to establish herself in lodgings\nat Tynemouth, on the coast of Northumberland. Here she lay on a couch\nfor nearly five years, seeing as few persons as might be, and working at\nsuch literary matters as came into her head with steadfast industry and\nfortitude. The ordeal was hard, but the little book that came of it,\n_Life in a Sickroom_, remains to show the moods in which the ordeal was\nborne.\n\nAt length Miss Martineau was induced to try mesmerism as a possible cure\nfor her disease, and what is certain is, that after trying mesmeric\ntreatment, the invalid whom the doctors had declared incurable shortly\nrecovered as perfect health as she had ever known. A virulent\ncontroversy arose upon the case, for, by some curious law, physicians\nare apt to import into professional disputes a heat and bitterness at\nleast as marked as that of their old enemies, the theologians. It was\nsaid that Miss Martineau had begun to improve before she was mesmerised,\nand what was still more to the point, that she had been taking heavy\ndoses of iodine. 'It is beyond all question or dispute,' as Voltaire\nsaid, 'that magic words and ceremonies are quite capable of most\neffectually destroying a whole flock of sheep, if the words be\naccompanied by a sufficient quantity of arsenic.'\n\nMesmerism was indirectly the means of bringing Miss Martineau into an\nintimate acquaintance with a gentleman, who soon began to exert a\ndecisive influence upon the most important of her opinions. Mr. Atkinson\nis still alive, and we need not say much about him. He seems to have\nbeen a grave and sincere person, using his mind with courageous\nindependence upon the great speculative problems which were not in 1844,\nas they are in 1877, the common topics of every-day intercourse among\neducated people. This is not the place for an examination of the\nphilosophy in which Miss Martineau was finally landed by Mr. Atkinson's\ninfluence. That philosophy was given to the world in 1851, in a volume\ncalled _Letters on the Laws of Man's Nature and Development_. The\ngreater part of it was written by Mr. Atkinson in reply to short\nletters, in which Miss Martineau stated objections and propounded\nquestions. The book points in the direction of that explanation of the\nfacts of the universe which is now so familiar under the name of\nEvolution. But it points in this way only, as the once famous _Vestiges\nof Creation_ pointed towards the scientific hypotheses of Darwin and\nWallace; or as Buckle's crude and superficial notions about the history\nof civilisation pointed towards a true and complete conception of\nsociology. That is to say, the Atkinson Letters state some of the\ndifficulties in the way of the explanations of life and motion hitherto\nreceived as satisfactory; they insist upon approaching the facts\nexclusively by the positive, Baconian, or inductive method; and then\nthey hurry to an explanation of their own, which may be as plausible as\nthat which they intend it to replace, but which they leave equally\nwithout ordered proof and strict verification.\n\nThe only point to which we are called upon to refer is that this way of\nthinking about man and the rest of nature led to repudiation by Miss\nMartineau of the whole structure of dogmatic theology. For one thing,\nshe ceased to hold the conception of a God with any human attributes\nwhatever; also of any principle or practice of Design; 'of an\nadministration of life according to human wishes, or of the affairs of\nthe world by the principles of human morals.' All these became to her\nas mere visions; beliefs necessary in their day, but not philosophically\nnor permanently true. Miss Martineau was not an Atheist in the\nphilosophic sense; she never denied a First Cause, but only that this\nCause is within the sphere of human attributes, or can be defined in\ntheir terms.\n\nThen, for another thing, she ceased to believe in the probability of\nthere being a continuance of conscious individual life after the\ndissolution of the body. With this, of course, fell all expectation of a\nstate of personal rewards and punishments. 'The real and justifiable and\nhonourable subject of interest,' she said, 'to human beings, living and\ndying, is the welfare of their fellows surrounding them or surviving\nthem.' About that she cared supremely, and about nothing else did she\nbring herself to care at all. It is painful to many people even to hear\nof a person holding such beliefs as these. Yet it would plainly be the\nworst kind of spiritual valetudinarianism to insist on the omission from\neven the shortest account of this remarkable woman, of what became the\nvery basis and foundation of her life for those thirty years of it,\nwhich she herself always counted the happiest part of the whole.\n\nAlthough it was Mr. Atkinson who finally provided her with a positive\nsubstitute for her older beliefs, yet a journey which Miss Martineau\nmade in the East shortly after her restoration to health (1846) had done\nmuch to build up in her mind a historic conception of the origin and\norder of the great faiths of mankind--the Christian, the Hebrew, the\nMahometan, the old Egyptian. We need not say more on this subject. The\nwork in which she published the experiences of the journey which was\nalways so memorable to her, deserves a word. There are few more\ndelightful books of travel than _Eastern Life, Past and Present_. The\ndescriptions are admirably graphic, and they have the attraction of\nmaking their effect by a few direct strokes, without any of the wordy\nelaboration of our modern picturesque. The writer shows a true feeling\nfor nature, and she shows a vigorous sense, which is not merely pretty\nsentiment, like Chateaubriand's, for the vast historic associations of\nthose old lands and dim cradles of the race. All is sterling and real;\nwe are aware that the elevated reflection and the meditative stroke are\nnot due to mere composition, but did actually pass through her mind as\nthe suggestive wonders passed before her eyes. And hence there is no jar\nas we find a little homily on the advantage of being able to iron your\nown linen on a Nile boat, followed by a lofty page on the mighty pair of\nsolemn figures that gaze as from eternity on time amid the sand at\nThebes. The whole, one may say again, is sterling and real, both the\nelevation and the homeliness. The student of the history of opinion may\nfind some interest in comparing Miss Martineau's work with the famous\nbook, _Ruins; or, Meditations on the Revolutions of Empires_, in which\nVolney, between fifty and sixty years before, had drawn equally\ndissolvent conclusions with her own from the same panorama of the dead\nages. Perhaps Miss Martineau's history is not much better than Volney's,\nbut her brisk sense is preferable to Volney's high _a priori_\ndeclamation and artificial rhetoric.\n\nBefore starting for the East, Miss Martineau had settled a new plan of\nlife for herself, and built a little house where she thought she could\nbest carry her plan out. To this little house she returned, and it\nbecame her cherished home for the long remainder of her days. London,\nduring the years of her first success, had not been without its usual\nattractions to the new-comer, but she had always been alive to the\nessential incompleteness, the dispersion, the want of steadfast\nself-collection, in a life much passed in London society. And we may\nbelieve that the five austere and lonely years at Tynemouth, with their\nevening outlook over the busy waters of the harbour-bar into the stern\nfar-off sea, may have slowly bred in her an unwillingness to plunge\nagain into the bustling triviality, the gossip, the distracting\nlightness of the world of splendid fireflies. To have discerned the Pale\nHorse so near and for so long a space awakens new moods, and strangely\nalters the old perspectives of our life. Yet it would imply a\nmisunderstanding of Harriet Martineau's character to suppose that she\nturned her back upon London, and built her pretty hermitage at\nAmbleside, in anything like the temper of Jean Jacques Rousseau. She was\nfar too positive a spirit for that, and far too full of vivid and\nconcentrated interest in men and their doings. It would be unjust to\nthink of Harriet Martineau as having no ear for the inner voices, yet\nher whole nature was objective; it turned to practice and not to\nreverie. She had her imaginative visions, as we know, and as all truly\nsuperior minds have them, even though their main superiority happens to\nbe in the practical order. But her visions were limited as a landscape\nset in a rigid frame; they had not the wings that soar and poise in the\nvague unbounded empyrean. And she was much too sensible to think that\nthese moods were strong, or constant, or absorbing enough in her case to\nfurnish material and companionship for a life from day to day and year\nto year. Nor again was it for the sake of undisturbed acquisition of\nknowledge, nor cultivation of her finer faculties that she sought a\nhermitage. She was not moved by thought of the famous maxim which Goethe\nputs into the mouth of Leonore--\n\n    Es bildet ein Talent sich in der Stille,\n    Sich ein Charakter in dem Strom der Welt.\n\nThough an intense egotist, in the good and respectable sense of\ninsisting on her own way of doing things, of settling for herself what\nit was that she was living for, and of treading the path with a firm and\nself-reliant step, yet Harriet Martineau was as little of an egotist as\never lived, in the poor and stifling sense of thinking of the perfecting\nof her own culture as in the least degree worthy of ranking among\nEnds-in-themselves. She settled in the Lake district, because she\nthought that there she would be most favourably placed for satisfying\nthe various conditions which she had fixed as necessary to her scheme of\nlife. 'My own idea of an innocent and happy life,' she says, 'was a\nhouse of my own among poor improvable neighbours, with young servants\nwhom I might train and attach to myself, with pure air, a garden,\nleisure, solitude at command, and freedom to work in peace and\nquietness.'\n\n'It is the wisest step in her life,' Wordsworth said, when he heard that\nshe had bought a piece of land and built a pretty house upon it; and\nthen he added the strangely unpoetic reason--'because the value of the\nproperty will be doubled in ten years.' Her poetic neighbour gave her a\ncharacteristic piece of advice in the same prudential vein. He warned\nher that she would find visitors a great expense. 'When you have a\nvisitor,' he said, 'you must do as we did; you must say: \"If you like to\nhave a cup of tea with us, you are very welcome; but if you want any\nmeat, you must pay for your board.\"' Miss Martineau declined to carry\nthrift to this ungracious extremity. She constantly had guests in her\nhouse, and, if they were all like Charlotte Bronte, they enjoyed their\nvisits in spite of the arbitrary ways of their energetic hostess.\n\nHer manner of life during these years is pleasant to contemplate;\ncheerful, active, thoroughly wholesome. 'My habit,' she says, 'was to\nrise at six and to take a walk, returning to my solitary breakfast at\nhalf-past seven. My household orders were given for the day, and all\naffairs settled out of doors and in by a quarter or half-past eight,\nwhen I went to work, which I continued without interruption, except from\nthe post, till three o'clock or later, when alone. While my friend was\nwith me we dined at two, and that was of course the limit of my day's\nwork.' De Tocqueville, if we remember, never saw his guests until after\nhe had finished his morning's work, of which he had done six hours by\neleven o'clock. Schopenhauer was still more sensitive to the jar of\nexternal interruption on that finely-tuned instrument, the brain, after\na night's repose, for it was as much as his housekeeper's place was\nworth to allow either herself or any one else to appear to the\nphilosopher before midday. After the early dinner at Ambleside cottage\ncame little bits of neighbourly business, exercise, and so forth. 'It is\nwith singular alacrity that in winter evenings I light the lamp and\nunroll my wool-work, and meditate or dream till the arrival of the\nnewspaper tells me that the tea has stood long enough. After tea, if\nthere was news from the seat of war, I called in my maids, who brought\ndown the great atlas and studied the chances of the campaign with me.\nThen there was an hour or two for Montaigne, or Bacon, or Shakespeare,\nor Tennyson, or some dear old biography.'\n\nThe only productions of this time worth mentioning are the _History of\nthe Thirty Years' Peace_ (1849) and the condensed version of Comte's\n_Positive Philosophy_ (1853), both of them meritorious and useful pieces\nof work, and both of them undertaken, as nearly all Miss Martineau's\nwork was, not from merely literary motives, but because she thought that\nthey would be meritorious and useful, and because nothing more useful\ncame into her head or under her hand at the moment. The condensation of\nComte is easy and rapid, and it is said by those who have looked very\nclosely into it to be hardly free from some too hasty renderings. It\nmust, however, on the whole, be pronounced a singularly intelligent and\nable performance. The pace at which Comte was able to compose is a\nstanding marvel to all who have pondered the great and difficult art of\ncomposition. It must be admitted that the author of the English version\nof him was in this respect no unworthy match for her original. Miss\nMartineau tells us that she despatched the last three volumes, which\nnumber over 1800 pages, in some five months. She thought the rendering\nof thirty pages of Comte a fair morning's work. If we consider the\nabstract and difficult nature of the matter, this must be pronounced\nsomething of a feat. We have not space to describe her method, but any\nreader who happens to be interested in the mechanism of literary\nproductions will find the passage in vol. ii. p. 391. _The History of\nthe Thirty Years' Peace_ is no less astonishing an example of rapid\nindustry. From the first opening of the books to study for the history\nto the depositing of the MS. of the first volume at press, was exactly\nsix months. The second volume took six months to do, with an interval of\nsome weeks of holiday and other work!\n\nWe think all this worth mentioning, because it is an illustration of\nwhat is a highly important maxim; namely, that it is a great mistake to\nexpend more time and labour on a piece of composition than is enough to\nmake it serve the purpose in hand. The immeasurable moment and\nfar-reachingness of the very highest kinds of literature are apt to make\nmen who play at being students forget there are many other kinds of\nliterature which are not in the least immeasurably far-reaching, but\nwhich, for all that, are extremely useful in their own day and\ngeneration. Those highly fastidious and indolent people, who sometimes\nlive at Oxford and Cambridge, with whom, indeed, for the most part,\ntheir high fastidiousness is only a fine name for impotence and lack of\nwill, forget that the less immortal kinds of literature are the only\nkinds within their own reach. Literature is no doubt a fine art--the\nfinest of the arts--but it is also a practical art; and it is deplorable\nto think how much stout, instructive work might and ought to be done by\npeople who, in dreaming of ideals in prose or verse beyond their\nattainment, end, like the poor Casaubon of fiction, in a little pamphlet\non a particle, or else in mediocre poetry, or else in nothing. By\ninsisting on rearing nothing short of a great monument more durable than\nbrass, they are cutting themselves off from building the useful little\nmud-hut, or some of the other modest performances by which only they are\ncapable of serving their age. It is only one volume in a million that is\nnot meant to perish, and to perish soon, as flowers, sunbeams, and all\nthe other brightnesses of the earth are meant to perish. There are some\nforms of composition in which perfection is not only good but\nindispensable. But the most are designed for the purpose of a day, and\nif they have the degree of elaboration, accuracy, grasp, and\nfaithfulness that suffice for the given purpose, then we may say that it\nis enough. There is literature proper, for which only two or three men\nand women in a generation have the true gift. This cannot be too good.\nBut besides this there is a mass of honest and needful work to be done\nwith the pen, to which literary form is only accidental, and in which\nconsummate literary finish or depth is a sheer work of supererogation.\nIf Miss Martineau had given twice as many years as she gave months to\nthe condensation of Comte, the book would not have been a whit more\nuseful in any possible respect--indeed, over-elaboration might easily\nhave made it much less so--and the world would have lost many other\nexcellent, if not dazzling or stupendous services.\n\n'Her original power,' she wrote of herself in that manly and outspoken\nobituary notice to which we have already referred, 'was nothing more\nthan was due to earnestness and intellectual clearness within a certain\nrange. With small imaginative and suggestive powers, and therefore\nnothing approaching to genius, she could see clearly what she did see,\nand give a clear expression to what she had to say. In short, she could\npopularise, while she could neither discover nor invent.... She could\nobtain and keep a firm grasp of her own views, and moreover she could\nmake them understood. The function of her life was to do this, and in as\nfar as it was done diligently and honestly, her life was of use.' All\nthis is precisely true, and her life was of great use; and that makes\nwhat she says not only true, but an example worth much weighing by many\nof those who meddle with literature.\n\nMiss Martineau was never tired of trying to be useful in directing and\nimproving opinion. She did not disdain the poor neighbours at her gates.\nShe got them to establish a Building Society, she set them an example of\nthrifty and profitable management by her little farm of two acres, and\nshe gave them interesting and cheerful courses of lectures in the winter\nevenings. All this time her eye was vigilant for the great affairs of\nthe world. In 1852 she began to write leading articles for the _Daily\nNews_, and in this department her industry and her aptitude were such\nthat at times she wrote as many as six leading articles in a week. When\nshe died, it was computed that she had written sixteen hundred. They are\nnow all dead enough, as they were meant to die, but they made an\nimpression that is still alive in its consequences upon some of the most\nimportant social, political, and economical matters of five-and-twenty\nimportant years. In what was by far the greatest of all the issues of\nthose years, the Civil War in the United States, Harriet Martineau's\ninfluence was of the most inestimable value in keeping public opinion\nright against the strong tide of ignorant Southern sympathies in this\ncountry. If she may seem to some to have been less right in her views of\nthe Crimean War, we must admit that the issues were very complex, and\nthat complete assurance on that struggle is not easy to everybody even\nat this distance of time.\n\nTo this period belong the Biographic Sketches which she contributed to a\nLondon newspaper. They have since been collected in a single volume, now\nin its fourth edition. They are masterpieces in the style of the\nvignette. Their conciseness, their clearness in fact, their definiteness\nin judgment, and above all, the rightly graduated impression of the\nwriter's own personality in the background, make them perfect in their\nkind. There is no fretting away of the portrait in over-multiplicity of\nlines and strokes. Here more than anywhere else Miss Martineau shows the\ntrue quality of the writer, the true mark of literature, the sense of\nproportion, the modulated sentence, the compact and suggestive phrase.\nThere is a happy precision, a pithy brevity, a condensed\nargumentativeness. And this literary skill is made more telling by the\nwriter's own evident interest and sincerity about the real lives and\ncharacters of the various conspicuous people with whom she deals. It may\nbe said that she has no subtle insight into the complexities of human\nnature, and that her philosophy of character is rather too little\nanalytical, too downright, too content with averages of motive, and too\nexternal. This is so in a general way, but it does not spoil the charm\nof these sketches, because the personages concerned, though all of them\nconspicuous, were for the most part commonplace in motive, though more\nthan commonplace in strength of faculty. Subtle analysis is wholly\nunreasonable in the case of Miss Martineau herself, and she would\nprobably have been unable to use that difficult instrument in\ncriticising characters less downright and objective than her own.\n\nThe moment of the Crimean War marked an alarming event in her own life.\nThe doctors warned her that she had a heart disease which would end her\ndays suddenly and soon. Miss Martineau at once set her affairs in order,\nand sat down to write her Autobiography. She had the manuscript put into\ntype, and the sheets finally printed off, just as we now possess them.\nBut the hour was not yet. The doctors had exaggerated the peril, and the\nstrong woman lived for twenty years after she had been given up. She\nused up the stuff of her life to the very end, and left no dreary\nremnant nor morbid waste of days. She was like herself to the\nlast--English, practical, positive. Yet she had thoughts and visions\nwhich were more than this. We like to think of this faithful woman and\nveteran worker in good causes, in the stroll which she always took on\nher terrace before retiring to rest for the night:--\n\n'On my terrace there were two worlds extended bright before me, even\nwhen the midnight darkness hid from my bodily eyes all but the outlines\nof the solemn mountains that surround our valley on three sides, and the\nclear opening to the lake on the south. In the one of those worlds I saw\nnow the magnificent coast of Massachusetts in autumn, or the flowery\nswamps of Louisiana, or the forests of Georgia in spring, or the\nIllinois prairie in summer; or the blue Nile, or the brown Sinai, or the\ngorgeous Petra, or the view of Damascus from the Salahiey; or the Grand\nCanal under a Venetian sunset, or the Black Forest in twilight, or Malta\nin the glare of noon, or the broad desert stretching away under the\nstars, or the Red Sea tossing its superb shells on shore in the pale\ndawn. That is one world, all comprehended within my terrace wall, and\ncoming up into the light at my call. The other and finer scenery is of\nthat world, only beginning to be explored, of Science.... It is truly an\nexquisite pleasure to dream, after the toil of study, on the sublime\nabstractions of mathematics; the transcendent scenery unrolled by\nastronomy; the mysterious, invisible forces dimly hinted to us by\nphysics; the new conception of the constitution of matter originated by\nchemistry; and then, the inestimable glimpses opened to us, in regard to\nthe nature and destiny of man, by the researches into vegetable and\nanimal organisation, which are at length perceived to be the right path\nof inquiry into the highest subjects of thought.... Wondrous beyond the\ncomprehension of any one mind is the mass of glorious facts and the\nseries of mighty conceptions laid open; but the shadow of the\nsurrounding darkness rests upon it all. The unknown always engrosses the\ngreater part of the field of vision, and the awe of infinity sanctifies\nboth the study and the dream.'\n\nIt would be a pity if difference of opinion upon subjects of profound\ndifficulty, remoteness, and manifold perplexity, were to prevent any one\nfrom recognising in such words and such moods as these what was, in\nspite of some infirmities, a character of many large thoughts and much\ngenerous purpose. And with this feeling we may part from her.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n  Sich ein Charakter im dem Strom der Welt.\n  has been changed to:\n  Sich ein Charakter in dem Strom der Welt.\n\n  literature which are are not in the least immeasurably far-reaching, but\n  has been changed to:\n  literature which are not in the least immeasurably far-reaching, but",
