    "body": "There was a queer feeling about the ship. \u201cHush,\u201d thought the man who\nstood by the gangway. That was the apt word. A battered ship, a dirty\ncraft, small, obscene, unseaworthy, of foreign register. And silent--hush!\nGrim faced men going about their business, sparing no word for him, though\nthey might have talked, he guessed, had they cared to.\n\nThis man who watched wore soiled dungarees. There was a day\u2019s stubble of\nbeard on his thin face. His expression, when a passing man darted a look\nat him, was blank. His eyes fell when other eyes probed him. He looked\nover his shoulder at times, at the rotting dock in the small British port\nof Beverstock near Liverpool, where this ship, the _Cora_, lay. He had\ncome aboard, nobody knew how. One moment, and the ship end of the gangway,\ncreaking as the current swayed the little tramp, was empty. The next\nmoment he was there. Nor did these others think it strange. They looked as\nif this sudden yet stealthy approach was usual, an accustomed thing, an\nitem, strange perhaps to some, yet of little moment in their full lives.\n\nThe man in dungarees stood there till the first cheerful man he had seen\naboard rolled up, the stout chief engineer.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s him,\u201d said the chief, and tapped him on the shoulder.\n\nThe man winced, turned, and saw, climbing the steep gangway, a man.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s him,\u201d repeated the stout chief. \u201cCaptain Bain.\u201d\n\nThe man in dungarees saw a tall, glum seafarer, with graying hair, his\nfrowsy shore going linen peeping from sleeves of shiny serge, his lapels\ngreasy; his boots polished long after polish had become a mockery; and,\ntopping all, a master\u2019s cap.\n\nThis was Captain Bain, right enough. He stopped, stared at the man in\ndungarees and said briefly--\n\n\u201cWhere from?\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican Bar,\u201d the man in dungarees replied.\n\n\u201cCome this way,\u201d said the captain. \u201cMy name\u2019s Bain. This is my cabin. We\ncan talk here. Out on deck talk\u2019s barred in port. Who sent you?\u201d\n\nHe fell silent, not because he waited for the answer, but more as if he\nhad run down, as if this long speech had been an effort, a breaking down\nof his accustomed reserve. The man in dungarees waited, as if expecting\nhim to say more, then at last replied:\n\n\u201cWho sent me? Dip Laplace.\u201d\n\nHe fumbled in the pocket of his dungarees and found a wad of crumpled\npaper.\n\n\u201cHe sent this, too.\u201d\n\nThe captain of the _Cora_ took the paper, opened it, held it up to the\nbeam of light that stole through the grimy port. The man in dungarees sat\ndown on a locker.\n\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Drake,\u201d he remarked.\n\nHis eyes were fixed on the captain. He saw a wave of color sweep up over\nold Bain\u2019s weatherbeaten neck, into his cheeks, then recede again.\n\nWhat the captain read, spelling out large printed words, was this:\n\n    Sparklers--they\u2019re wise--watch.\n\nThe captain of the _Cora_ crumpled the paper in his hand.\n\n\u201cYou read this, of course?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m no liar. I did, of course,\u201d the man in dungarees mimicked him. \u201cAs I\nsaid, my name\u2019s Drake--\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd this paper?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve forgotten what was on it,\u201d Drake told him.\n\n\u201cDip gave it to you. Dip grows jocular,\u201d the captain laughed harshly. \u201cAre\nyou another of his jokes?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a passenger.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t carry passengers.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy kind? Dip sent me, remember.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know then; you have money?\u201d\n\nDrake spread five fifty-pound notes out on his knee.\n\n\u201cAs bad as that?\u201d The captain whistled. \u201cYou could swank aboard a liner\nfor that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd swank off across the pond?\u201d\n\nThe captain stroked his long jaw reflectively. His eyes wandered over\nDrake\u2019s face, stopped for a moment on the wall clock above his head,\ndropped to the pile of treasury notes and dwelt there.\n\n\u201cAs bad as that?\u201d said the captain of the _Cora_. \u201cNot murder?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Dip sent me. He knows. Need you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNeed I? God forbid. Can you swim?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, why?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to. I see you don\u2019t know the game we play. Better learn\nbefore I take your money. You find it--convenient--to travel informally,\nto land on the other side incognito-- No, your name may be Drake, and I\ndon\u2019t care if it is or not. Names don\u2019t count here. But you wish to land\nas Drake, unknown to anyone. We arrange that. No immigration folk to\npester you. No police. We sail for Montreal. Below that city fifty miles\nor so are islands. Sometimes we go slowly through them, close to land. An\nactive swimmer, dropping overside--you have more money, have you not?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Captain, a little.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a man on one island, there. He has a boat. If you give him more\nthan five pounds, he\u2019s robbing you. After that your movements are not my\nconcern.\u201d\n\nAgain, as the captain paused, Drake had that strange feeling that here was\na man talking overmuch--a man more fond of silence.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s all?\u201d Drake asked. \u201cSimple, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI feared I\u2019d have to work my passage, and I\u2019m lazy.\u201d\n\nThe captain of the _Cora_ reached for the little pile of notes.\n\n\u201cA man must live,\u201d he growled, as if apologizing for his delinquencies. \u201cA\nman must live, and there\u2019s no money in tramp shipping. You\u2019ll find a small\ncabin on the port side--the empty one. It\u2019s yours. We sail with the tide.\nIf you come on deck before that and are nabbed--\u201d he patted his pocket\nwhere he had stowed those notes--\u201cthat\u2019s your lookout, Drake.\u201d\n\nDrake rose and crossed the little cabin. At the threshold he paused.\n\n\u201cThose other cabins--\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are three. The others, you won\u2019t meet till we are at sea.\u201d\n\nDrake stepped out, dropped down a steep iron stair to the deck, slid into\nthe port alley, where tiny doors formed a row, tried first one, then\nanother, till he found one unlocked, entered, and found himself in a cabin\nso small that it could scarcely contain a bunk and its occupant at the\nsame time.\n\nMen had watched him--shadowy figures, heads out of the galley, the\nengine-room, the firehold. They had said nothing, betrayed no surprise at\nhis coming. They were silent men.\n\n\u201cHush!\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe salt wind drifted across the deck of the _Cora_. She was wallowing in\nthe Atlantic.\n\nDrake and the fat chief sat in the lee of the funnel. They had struck up\nan acquaintance during the first half of the voyage. Drake had traveled;\nhe knew things. The fat chief, a jovial rascal, had the curiosity of a\nchild and a stout man\u2019s zest for effortless, vicarious adventure.\n\nThe two other passengers had kept apart. There was Quayle, as yet sticking\nclose to his cabin, save at mealtimes when he joined Drake at the\ncaptain\u2019s table. He had given that name, Quayle, casually, as if it had\njust occurred to him, as if names were matters of only passing importance.\n\nHe was a tall, silent man, middle-aged.\n\nThe third passenger messed with the crew. He was a small Liverpool dock\nrat. He claimed that he had not killed his wife, but had only beaten her.\nThe captain, after discreetly calling up a hospital, found that this was\ntrue. Because he had but twenty pounds they had taken him for that. He\nnever came up on the boat deck; he viewed the ocean with ignorant terror\nand kept behind the high steel bulwarks of the well deck, when he came out\nfor air.\n\nThe chief, having a romantic mind, decided that the Liverpool man\u2019s wife\nwould probably take a turn for the worse and die. He held that the other\npassenger, Quayle, was a Bolshevik.\n\nThe chief and Drake sat there and yarned through the long sea morning.\n\n\u201cA rum ship,\u201d Drake hazarded.\n\n\u201cWe are that,\u201d the chief grinned, \u201cat home to rum company.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue, but you know each other; we don\u2019t, we passengers.\u201d\n\n\u201cFive new faces in the ship\u2019s company,\u201d the chief laughed. \u201cYe see, we\ncan\u2019t keep \u2019em. We ship so many passengers that it has made _their_ pile\neasy, or on the way to make it easy. It corrupts the lads. Five new\nfaces--five old \u2019uns gone to do likewise--on the trail o\u2019 easy money. Man,\ndear, \u2019tis restless labor is getting to be--\u201d\n\n\u201cEight of us, new chums, not knowing each other--for five and three is\neight.\u201d\n\nDrake stared out to sea.\n\n\u201cEight souls,\u201d sighed the chief. \u201cWhere they comes from. Gawd only knows.\nWhere they\u2019re bound, Gawd don\u2019t care; speakin\u2019 more exact, nine. For I\u2019d\nforgot Sparks.\u201d\n\nDrake glanced forward. The tall radio man was in his hencoop, a scant\ntwenty feet away. The door was open.\n\n\u201cWhy him?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother bird o\u2019 passage. D\u2019ye notice his duds?\u201d\n\n\u201cNew and fancy.\u201d\n\n\u201cKnow what the pay is? Man, dear, if he bought them out of wages, he\u2019s\nnever had smoke nor drink in years. Ever see a tramp\u2019s wireless wonder\nbefore? No. Know what I think? He\u2019s an absconding Scot. He figured we\u2019d\nsoak him hard for an unconventional passage. You know what you paid, so--\u201d\n\nThe chief closed his eyes and gave the details of his imaginative romance\nin a few low words:\n\n\u201cSparks gets him a uniform. Eighty bob, mebbe; or steals one. He finds out\nwe\u2019re gettin\u2019 a new radio man this voyage. An\u2019 then, back in port some\npoor dub brass pounder is wakin\u2019 up, mebbe in hospital. And this\nsport--well, he\u2019s on the papers as Sparks, but we lose our dividend on his\npassage thereby.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you figure him, as you might say, a jailbird of passage.\u201d\n\nDrake had raised his voice. The chief clutched his arm.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ye now; don\u2019t rile that one. Man, dear, every time that devilish\ncontraption spits sparks I shudder. Think o\u2019 the slander yon lad could\nspread and nobody knowin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cSlander?\u201d\n\n\u201cSlander \u2019bout--you--or me, M\u2019Ginley. Oh, aye, there\u2019s tales he could\ntell, even if he\u2019s new. Would ye believe it?\u201d The old chief rose. \u201cYe\nmight not; but some o\u2019 the lads aboard here has loose tongues. A thing I\nabhor, personal.\u201d And off the old man waddled.\n\nDrake sat there a moment. He was thinking:\n\n\u201cI wonder. Another little swimmer when we come to that island? Will there\nbe four of us in the water? Will the fourth be Sparks? If so--best watch\nhim.\u201d\n\nRising, he added a codicil to this conclusion.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nine aboard, counting myself,\u201d he thought, \u201cnine that may be,\nwell, anything. Best start figuring this one out. That\u2019ll leave eight. And\none of the eight is me, Drake. Wonder what I\u2019ll be, when we come to the\nend of the voyage?\u201d\n\nHe glanced aft. The stout chief engineer was there, where he had paused on\nthe stair that led below.\n\n\u201cThem that don\u2019t talk here,\u201d said M\u2019Ginley, \u201cthem that don\u2019t talk on this\nship--they guesses.\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nDrake slipped forward till he stood by the open door of the wireless coop.\nThe new Sparks looked up.\n\n\u201cWant anything?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cJust loafing round.\u201d Drake rolled a cigarette slowly, clumsily. \u201cSmoke?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nThe wireless man reached for pouch and papers, twisted with swift fingers,\nstruck a match and was exhaling smoke, almost before Drake himself had\nlighted up.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been in the States?\u201d Drake asked. \u201cLearned to make a gasper there,\ndidn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re from the old country, calling a cig that?\u201d\n\n\u201cA good country to come from--and the faster the coming the better,\u201d Drake\ndrawled. \u201cOld country\u2019s not--healthy.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor some.\u201d\n\nThe wireless man bent over his complicated machinery, as it became alive.\nDrake looked on, wonder in his eyes, almost a childish wonder.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s marvelous,\u201d said he. \u201cWords coming out of the air.\u201d\n\n\u201cDot dash dot dash,\u201d said the wireless man. \u201cSee that smoke yonder? The\n_Paladin_. She\u2019s asking the _Caradoc_ if they\u2019ve met ice. Bergs drifting\nnow, you know.\u201d\n\nDrake glanced at the wall clock, then drifted toward the door.\n\nIt was eleven o\u2019clock. It was Wednesday--five days since they had left\nport. This old ruin of a ship was traveling with speed.\n\nThe voice of the wireless man followed him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Cray; come again,\u201d he called. \u201cThis packet doesn\u2019t run to rules.\u201d\n\nDrake turned. He seemed uneasy.\n\n\u201cIf--\u201d he began.\n\n\u201cIf what?\u201d Cray waited.\n\n\u201cIf you hear something with that gadget about a man named Drake, the fewer\nknow--the better. Get me?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t slip me money.\u201d Cray\u2019s hand met his, thrust it back. \u201cYou\u2019ll need\nall you got. A rum lot, on a rum ship.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you as rum as they come,\u201d thought Drake, as he walked away.\n\nCray watched him go.\n\n\u201cWonder if he knew what was on the air just now,\u201d he scowled. \u201cIf I shove\nit to the Old Man will he--well, this time I\u2019m a wireless man. Next time\nwe\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nTo him, too, this strange ship was saying, \u201cHush!\u201d Yet his pencil slid\nover flimsy paper. He rose with a message, took it to the captain on the\nbridge.\n\n\u201cRum lot aboard, sir.\u201d He handed the message over, winked.\n\nThe captain started, backed away into a wing of the bridge, scanned that\nmessage.\n\n\u201cYou are right,\u201d he replied. \u201cThis came in code, I presume?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why not leave it in code. We don\u2019t want the world knowing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s seen it, sir, but me.\u201d\n\n\u201cDamn you! That\u2019s an order. Anything else comes, leave it in code.\u201d\n\nCray went white and was about to speak. Then he checked himself. He walked\naway; he was thinking.\n\n\u201cHim, too--the Old Man. Wonder what he knows that the world don\u2019t, that\nhe\u2019s afraid of the world learning? I\u2019ll, maybe, find out. I\u2019ll see.\nTonight, maybe. He might work in. Who knows?\u201d\n\nThe captain, staring at the retreating back was staring at words that\nfloated before his eyes.\n\nFor that message had read:\n\n  All ships. All ships. All ships.\n    Varnavosk necklace stolen. Suspect at sea.\n    Watch passengers. Stand by for more.\n                              --Scotland Yard.\n\nThe urgency of the thrice repeated \u201cAll ships\u201d--that stabbed him, made him\nwince. Trouble, trouble in large consignments, coming out of the air.\nOther messages, and the field of search might narrow, perhaps, till it\ncentered on an old tramp wallowing across the Western Ocean; till some\nswift offshore craft might draw alongside, and some officious jackanapes\nwould climb up the ladder and ask fool questions about eight new faces\naboard the _Cora_.\n\nThere was trouble on the ship that said, \u201cHush.\u201d\n\nThe captain walked stiffly across the bridge and down to his cabin. Cray,\non the boat deck, watched him go.\n\n\u201cYes, we\u2019ll use you, my bucko,\u201d said Cray. \u201cNow I wonder--\u201d and he stared\ndown on the well deck, forward, where the little Liverpool passenger\nsprawled on a hatch cover.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a shiner on your eye, my lad,\u201d thought Cray, \u201cand you mess\nwith the crew. They\u2019ll be eating any moment now. I think we\u2019d better not\nwait. We\u2019ll begin with you.\u201d\n\nHe followed the old captain of the _Cora_ to his cabin.\n\nWhen the passengers who messed with the skipper came in to lunch, that\nworthy\u2019s chair was vacant. Cray it was who greeted them, smiling at Drake,\nbowing stiffly to tall Quayle.\n\n\u201cOld Man\u2019s busy,\u201d said Cray. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for him, gentlemen.\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat was Wednesday. On Thursday the fat engineer M\u2019Ginley sought the warm\nlee of the funnel once more. Drake was there, waiting.\n\n\u201cI made my peace with Cray. If he was mad about what I said, he didn\u2019t\nshow it.\u201d\n\n\u201cA bad case,\u201d the fat old chief growled. \u201cThere\u2019s more in this ship than\nballast. There\u2019s a mystery.\u201d\n\n\u201cEight little mysteries,\u201d Drake jeered, \u201cof which one is my humble self.\nMaybe nine, counting Cray. Or ten--\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you alludin\u2019 to now?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou, honest old M\u2019Ginley.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe? Man could see clean through me.\u201d The chief winked at him. \u201cBut look\nat this code; and all that pencilin\u2019 under it is writ by the most talented\nengineer on the Western Ocean.\u201d\n\nDrake glanced down at the flimsy bit of paper. He saw first a jumble of\nphrases and part words. But below that a penciled legend made sense.\n\n  All ships.\n    Varnavosk dying. Look for strong man capable killing bare-handed.\n\nNo signature this time.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you get this?\u201d\n\nDrake stiffened. He glanced forward uneasily; but Cray\u2019s blind was drawn\non the little window of his cabin. Cray\u2019s door was shut.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you think? Notice the Old Man yesterday and today?\u201d the old chief\nasked. \u201cWell, he\u2019s fair wild. He come down this mornin\u2019 an\u2019 asks me to\ntrot along, confidential. We goes to that wife beatin\u2019 runt\u2019s cabin. The\nrunt is out on deck. Old Man and me, we rip up the floorboards, we pry\napart the bunk.\u201d\n\n\u201cLooking for what?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t tell at first. Then, when we found nothin\u2019, he begun to rave\nabout jewelry. Him, that\u2019s carried such downan\u2019-outs before, lookin\u2019 for\njewelry in that cabin. Told me to shut up. Left me standin\u2019 on air, like.\nSo I mooched. Half an hour ago Cray comes down with this. Old Man looks\nher over, puzzles her out. He was standin\u2019 by his cabin. Next he dives in,\ngrabs somethin\u2019, pockets it--an\u2019 comes out again. Know what he grabbed?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis gun. Me, I grabs somethin\u2019 else. This. Now you know as much as I do,\nunless you know more.\u201d\n\nDrake stared at him, then dropped his eyes.\n\n\u201cAnd if I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cCray and the Old Man know a heap. My guess is there\u2019s been robbery; and\nnow it looks like murder. Like as not the search\u2019ll narrer down. Scotland\nYard ain\u2019t manned by fools. Like as not there\u2019ll be other messages.\nLiverpool runt\u2019s been cleared. He don\u2019t pack no valuables. There\u2019s seven\nnew faces aboard beside him, leavin\u2019 Cray out. If things gets hot and they\nstart to search the lot--well--him that has them jewels is like to swing.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless--\u201d Drake seemed to be master of himself now--\u201cunless!\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless the lad slipped \u2019em to a good natur\u2019d old fool of an engineer.\nThere\u2019s places below.\u201d Old M\u2019Ginley winked. \u201cWell, if you meet the man\naboard here, you tell him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, I will. Cray\u2019s blind\u2019s gone up.\u201d Drake rose. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a\nchin with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing more\u2019n another has hanged fool men, it\u2019s words,\u201d\nM\u2019Ginley warned, and left him.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nCray grinned as Drake opened the door.\n\n\u201cYou--you heard anything?\u201d Drake asked, nervously.\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThought, maybe, some message might have drifted in; seen you writing a\nwhile back.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was,\u201d Cray laughed. \u201cFool operator on the _Jessamine_ was askin\u2019 me\nif I\u2019d bought my girl that diamond yet.\u201d\n\nDrake stood by the table, his lean fingers clasped about its beveled edge.\nCray, watching covertly, smiled. That table was shaking, though it was\nfastened to the floor.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a strong man, ain\u2019t you?\u201d Cray asked.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s stronger aboard this packet,\u201d Drake answered tonelessly. \u201cWhere\u2019d\nthe Old Man dig up those new sailormen? Two of them I saw this morning,\nramming at that bent stanchion that supports this deck. Take four of me to\nmake one of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an idea,\u201d Cray smiled, as if relishing his chance to play with\nthis man.\n\n\u201cWhat is?\u201d Drake frowned. \u201cMakin\u2019 one of them from four of me?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen there\u2019s Quayle; he\u2019s husky, too. Well, beef don\u2019t count with me.\u201d\nCray shoved a chair forward. \u201cWant to listen in?\u201d\n\nHe reached for an extra headset, plugged in, adjusted it for Drake, then\nwatched him, keenly, as some faint message came.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what it sounds like?\u201d Drake looked up. \u201cI\u2019ve often wondered.\u201d\n\nBut Cray was busy, writing. His pencil fairly shook as it sped over the\npaper.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\nDrake looked over his shoulder. Too late, Cray shoved a hand over what he\nhad written, for Drake had seen, seen plainly, the uncompleted sentences:\n\n  All ships.\n    Varnavosk died this morning.\n    Communicate with us if....\n\n\u201cYou seen, hey?\u201d Cray fidgeted, seemed annoyed; yet he might be\npretending. He was, at any rate, ill at ease.\n\n\u201cYou seen? Well, what\u2019s a Russky more or less to you or me? Don\u2019t tell the\nOld Man I showed you. The others came in code. This one\u2019s plain English.\nBest beat it; I\u2019ve got to take this to the Old Man.\u201d\n\nDrake got up and walked silently out. On the threshold Cray stopped him\nwith:\n\n\u201cEver know any Russians, Drake? Some of them is big men--hard fighters.\nTake a powerful man to handle them.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeaning--\u201d Drake spun about fiercely-- \u201cMeaning--\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know more\u2019n you let on,\u201d Cray laughed. \u201cThought I\u2019d catch you. You\nknow who Varnavosk was, owner of the Varnavosk necklace? You know why he\u2019s\ndead--\u201d\n\nDrake rolled a cigaret with his usual clumsiness.\n\n\u201cWhat mobsman doesn\u2019t know?\u201d he asked. \u201cCome, come, Cray. You know what\nsort we passengers are on this dirty little ship. Know Varnavosk and his\nnecklace? Who does not, in my walk of life? What gang but has had their\neyes on him and his jewels? And now, that a cleverer man than myself has\npulled the trick--\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re a crook,\u201d Cray jeered. \u201cSo--\u201d\n\nDrake smiled pleasantly.\n\n\u201cDid you think me a lily?\u201d Drake was composed now. \u201cImagination\u2019s a grand\nthing, Cray. Sometimes it leads men into trouble, though. You\u2019ve been\nreading dime novels.\u201d\n\nDrake walked away. Cray watched him go aft along the boat deck and down\nthe steep stairs.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll worry, my man,\u201d growled Cray. \u201cNow, what\u2019s next. Liverpool swine\nis ruled out. That fool of a skipper--a child could see through him. He\u2019s\nripped that dub\u2019s cabin to pieces. At this rate he\u2019ll have the whole ship\ntorn apart, every manjack on edge. Not one\u2019ll get by him without him\npoking and prying. And he\u2019s fool enough to make a bad break. So, we\u2019re\nfive days from port, and--\u201d\n\nHe stared at that last message, which he had left incomplete. With a swift\npencil he ended it.\n\n  All ships, westbound. Communicate with us if you have news. Proceed with\n  caution.\n                                                           --Scotland Yard\n\n\u201cAnd that,\u201d said Cray to himself, as he took the message to the captain of\nthe _Cora_, \u201cthat\u2019ll hold him for a while. This ship is jammed full of\n_strong men_.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you can\u2019t find him, the thief,\u201d Cray jeered.\n\nThere was no deference in his tone, no respect. Here he sat in the Old\nMan\u2019s cabin and yarned away as if such a thing as discipline had ceased to\nexist.\n\n\u201cThe thief? He\u2019s been a murderer for two days.\u201d Old Bain scowled at him.\n\u201cYou have me nigh crazy. First we rip up that little rat\u2019s cabin--\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was you; I just hinted--\u201d Cray began.\n\n\u201cHinted like you did when that message came about lookin\u2019 for a strong man\nwho could kill barehanded!\u201d\n\n\u201cA strong man; you\u2019ve found several,\u201d Cray retorted. \u201cWas it me said it\nmight be one of those two sailors? Oh, yes. I admit I didn\u2019t contradict\nyou. I\u2019ll say I let you have your way, do your own crude sleuthing,\nsearching that forecastle. Don\u2019t you know that sailormen are a neat lot,\neven such scum as this? They know this moment that you have been prodding\nabout. And now you say--\u201d\n\n\u201cYou put things into my mind, damn you!\u201d The Old Man glowered at him. \u201cI\nthinks things, and says things, and there ain\u2019t no reason to them when\nsaid and thought. They ain\u2019t my thoughts; they ain\u2019t my actions, an\u2019--\u201d\n\n\u201cMine, of course, hey? I do it all? Mebbe I did this. This came today.\u201d\nCray shoved a sheet of paper at him. The Old Man ran his eye over a jumble\nof code, then reached for his book, translated.\n\n\u201cYou know what it is?\u201d He lifted his head and stared at Cray. \u201cYou know--\u201d\n\n\u201cAll ships? No, not this time. The search has narrowed down,\u201d Cray grated.\n\u201cThis one is:\n\n  \u201cShips outward bound, Beverstock. Man aboard you. Hold him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich means--\u201d The skipper of the luckless _Cora_ waited.\n\n\u201cUs!\u201d Cray\u2019s face was tense. \u201cScotland Yard--they\u2019ve got a line on us;\nthey\u2019re closing in on their man.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when--when some detective comes up the ladder-- We\u2019re nigh into St.\nLawrence Gulf--\u201d the Old Man stared out of the grimy port--\u201cWhen the\nshowdown comes.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever such a ship for secrets as this,\u201d Cray said. \u201cThey\u2019ll come for one.\nThey\u2019ll find a heap.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou, for instance,\u201d the captain suggested.\n\n\u201cSure, me an\u2019 you. Think I\u2019m sweating over this just for fun? Think I give\na damn if they get their man? Me? Hell, no! I got my reasons; so have you.\nThey\u2019ll come aboard with the pilot, maybe. They\u2019ll begin poking round.\nUnless--\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless what?\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless the man\u2019s ready for them. Then, it\u2019s a pat on the back and a clean\nbill of health for you; and, \u2018Thanks, my noble radio man; your message was\nmusic to our honest ears,\u2019 for me.\u201d Cray stopped.\n\n\u201cAnd so--\u201d\n\nCray leaned closer.\n\n\u201cGet this. There\u2019s two men we ain\u2019t searched yet--Drake and Quayle. Either\none, mebbe--\u201d\n\nThe old captain rose.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll start with Quayle, eh?\u201d He made for the door, but he stopped,\nturned. \u201cYou put that into my head, damn ye!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if I did?\u201d Cray cried. \u201cWhat if I did? Since you have no detective\naboard, what price Cray, hey?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat price Cray? I\u2019ll tell ye. I\u2019d as soon to God we had a detective\naboard,\u201d the captain growled. \u201cThat\u2019s what price Cray!\u201d He stumped out.\n\nThe wireless man got up slowly and idled about the cabin as if it were his\nown. That last remark of the skipper\u2019s had hit him.\n\n\u201cA detective,\u201d said Cray softly. \u201cMaybe we have, at that, my brave old\nsea-dog. Maybe we have, at that.\u201d\n\nHe followed the captain on deck and twitched his sleeve. He drew him into\na corner.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do this next job myself,\u201d said Cray.\n\n\u201cYou mean Quayle?\u201d\n\n\u201cHim. You better stick to your knitting. Talk like a human being at lunch,\nkeep that solemn-faced, secretive Quayle there, until-- You ever figure\nthere\u2019ll maybe be a reward for them diamonds?\u201d\n\n\u201cReward?\u201d The old captain of the _Cora_ snorted. \u201cReward? If I can sleep\nagain o\u2019 nights, that\u2019ll be reward enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could do with a good sleep myself,\u201d Cray laughed. \u201cI might sleep\nthrough lunch hour, while Quayle\u2019s cabin is empty.\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nMorning again and bright sunlight on the Gulf. Tomorrow would see the\npilot coming aboard at Father Point. Tomorrow would see, well, something\nrather ghastly to men who clutched secrets close, who feared the eye of\nthe law.\n\nBut today the sun shone. Drake and the old engineer sat there by the\nfunnel.\n\nOld M\u2019Ginley was sleepy. A bearing had been heating. He had not yet been\nto bed. He had come up for a whiff of fresh air. He was soon wide awake,\nfor Drake, leaning over, whispered--\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking what you said.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said a heap, laddie.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout hiding things.\u201d\n\nHe opened his dungaree suit. The old man saw a long thin packet of brown\npaper, sealed with wax, tied with many intricate knots.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking--and whispering a bit,\u201d Drake went on.\n\n\u201cOh, aye, doubtless.\u201d\n\nM\u2019Ginley\u2019s eyes glinted. A chief engineer, he knew, could hide things,\nwhere nobody, not even the man who had trusted them to him, could find\nthem.\n\n\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he repeated, \u201csomething else has whispered, me bold lad. Fear\nhas, I\u2019m thinking.\u201d\n\nDrake\u2019s face was blank.\n\n\u201cI told the person what you said. There\u2019s been funny work. Cray and the\nskipper searching yesterday, today, all cabins but mine. Tomorrow--\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps yours. Tomorrow the pilot and--\u201d\n\nThe old man too was leaning closer. The packet passed.\n\n\u201cIf a knot\u2019s untied, or a seal broken--my--my friend says there\u2019ll be no\nsplit,\u201d Drake grated.\n\n\u201cUnless he goes where splittin\u2019 is hard, save he split rocks,\u201d M\u2019Ginley\nlaughed, and he drew back. \u201cThat bearin\u2019--it needs a pile o\u2019 lookin\u2019\nafter.\u201d\n\nHe lumbered away. Drake sat there. The man Quayle, the silent, secretive\nQuayle came up on deck. He walked along. He bent over Drake. He whispered\nsomething. Drake sprang to his feet. Quayle was of an age with him, taller\nby a head, powerfully built.\n\nBoth the captain, staring down from the bridge, and Cray, peering out of\nhis little window, saw Drake\u2019s fist shoot out--a blow that seemed but to\nglance off Quayle\u2019s jaw. Yet Quayle fell, lay there, knocked out.\n\nDrake walked forward. He beat on Cray\u2019s door with his fists, crying:\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a ship\u2019s this? What sort o\u2019 man are you?\nBlabbin\u2019--blabbin\u2019--\u201d\n\nThe captain, clutching the bridge rail, leaned over and bawled:\n\n\u201cYou keep still, mister. What\u2019s wrong with ye? One more crack like that\nand--\u201d\n\nHe paused. Tomorrow, when the pilot and whoever else was waiting came\naboard, he would no longer have the power, save to stand dumbly by and\nwatch.\n\nBut now, now Cray had his door open and was talking to the enraged Drake.\nAnd Drake, calming himself by an effort, was being drawn inside. The\ncaptain wished that this strange man Cray would leave that door open. He\nhoped, at least, that afterward he would tell him frankly what now was\ngoing on.\n\nInside, Cray was talking swiftly:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019d he say? Did he tell you I was blabbing?\u201d\n\n\u201cBlabbing. What talking\u2019s been done--\u201d Drake paused, as if uncertain.\n\u201cForget it. A man don\u2019t like to be told he\u2019s like to swing. I\u2019m hot\nheaded. I figured mebbe you\u2019d told him what was in that cablegram--the one\nabout Varnavosk bein\u2019 dead--mebbe more, too. But--\u201d\n\n\u201c_Forget it_ is right.\u201d\n\nCray was acting strangely. Yesterday he had told the captain that the\nmurderer, supposedly on their ship, must be either Quayle or Drake. Now he\nseemed to have shifted his views, unless he wished to lull Drake into a\nstate of false security.\n\n\u201cForget it is right,\u201d he grinned, reaching for the spare headset, already\nadjusted to fit Drake. \u201cWant to listen in a spell? I\u2019m goin\u2019 out for a\nbreather. If you hear anything funny call me.\u201d\n\nDrake hesitated.\n\n\u201cWhat you planning to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Cray answered. \u201cBe a sport. Most men\u2019d get hot if you come\nravin\u2019 at \u2019em; but me, I\u2019m different. You set there. Forget it!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d Drake scowled. \u201cIf the Old Man says anything about that row\nwith Quayle, you tell him it\u2019s an old score we were settling.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight!\u201d\n\nCray crossed the threshold and slammed the door shut. Drake listened as he\nwalked down the deck; he heard other footsteps. Out of the window he\ncaught a glimpse of the captain\u2019s gray head, then the boatswain,\nsupporting a limp Quayle toward the stair.\n\n\u201cI wonder--\u201d Drake frowned at the wireless set--\u201cwhat\u2019s their next move.\nAnd old M\u2019Ginley--what\u2019s he doing?\u201d\n\nOld M\u2019Ginley, cutting loose cord after cord, breaking through wax seals,\nwas opening that brown paper parcel.\n\nWhat he found turned him into a covetous old man, who thought furiously.\nFinally, one hand fondling his pocket, he climbed heavily down ladders to\nhis own peculiar domain.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnce more Cray faced the old skipper in his cabin.\n\n\u201cYou saw that?\u201d Bain was eager. He sensed, at last, the end of this\nmystery. \u201cYou saw that Drake and heard him howl about blabbing!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Cray scoffed. \u201cHeard a heap; but I\u2019m not taking that for gospel.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must be him. You found nothing in Quayle\u2019s cabin?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Cray answered. \u201cI\u2019m figuring on looking again. Know what I\nthink? They\u2019re both in the theft, if not the murder. Take those names.\nBoth birds\u2019 names--Quayle and Drake--ain\u2019t they? Sort of funny, them both\nchoosing the same sort of monikers for this trip. Like one had thought of\none, and the other had followed suit. Crooks are like that.\u201d\n\nThe captain gazed at him speculatively.\n\n\u201cCray--crayfish--another zo\u00f6logical name. Well, go on. You don\u2019t pass as\nan honest man, Cray. Lay to that. You\u2019re no better, if no worse, than the\nrest aboard this packet. What were you going to say?\u201d\n\n\u201cI got an idea they been passing that necklace from one to t\u2019other,\u201d Cray\nexplained. \u201cThey had hard words. What if Quayle had it last, after I\nsearched his dump? What if he wouldn\u2019t hand over, an\u2019 Drake--I been\nworking on him, scaring him--if Drake, I say, figured Quayle was goin\u2019 to\ngyp him? How about that? Mebbe Quayle ain\u2019t scared of getting caught. I\nsearched his dump careful. He may figure he ain\u2019t suspected no more. He\nmay think, if he is suspected, that we don\u2019t know how to search right. And\nDrake, figurin\u2019 he\u2019s losin\u2019 out, gets mad.\u201d\n\nThe captain shook his head. Father Point was getting closer. Morning and\nthe pilot would come, and with them--well, iron bars, perhaps; certainly a\nlost ticket and a lot of trouble. A man couldn\u2019t account for three extra\nmen on his ship--and such men.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. If we miss this time--\u201d He paused.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll search both cabins,\u201d Gray broke in, \u201cand both at once. You take\nQuayle\u2019s; I\u2019ll go for Drake\u2019s. We\u2019ll win this time.\u201d\n\nThe captain stared at him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do it; but how?\u201d\n\n\u201cEasy,\u201d Cray smiled. \u201cThat worthless old chief engineer--let him tag on to\nDrake. They are thick, anyway. As for Quayle--he\u2019s battered up, ain\u2019t he?\nOr if he ain\u2019t exactly battered, he\u2019s shook. Take a couple of men, drag\nhim out, say you\u2019re givin\u2019 him your room, more light an\u2019 air. Sure, he\u2019ll\nsuspect, but what can he do? Take them two big sailormen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt might be; but when? Drake sticks below of afternoons.\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow morning we got a couple of hours,\u201d Cray went on. \u201cWhen we find\nthat necklace--\u201d\n\n\u201cWe give it up, and get clear of--\u201d\n\n\u201cLike hell! We keep it!\u201d Cray corrected him. \u201cOr I keep it. Never mind\nhow. I\u2019ll pin the job on one of them. Don\u2019t you worry.\u201d\n\nThe captain stared at him, aghast.\n\n\u201cBut they\u2019ll search the ship.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet \u2019em. They won\u2019t find it.\u201d Cray got up. \u201cI left Drake in my monkey-\nhouse. Best get him out of there. Tomorrow morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe captain looked out the door, as Cray opened it. The hills of the south\nshore of the Gulf stood out grim and gray, somber, all shadow. Tomorrow.\nWell, sooner it comes, sooner over.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe two big sailors dragged Quayle, protesting, out of his cabin. A\nstrangely ungrateful man he seemed. Up on the boat deck Drake heard the\nrow.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe old chief, M\u2019Ginley, leaned closer.\n\n\u201cThem--them diamonds,\u201d he whispered.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d you know. You\u2019ve broke the seals,\u201d Drake accused.\n\nM\u2019Ginley shrank back.\n\n\u201cMe? What you think? Ain\u2019t I acted straight with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better.\u201d\n\nDrake thrust one hand inside his dungaree suit. Something bulged under his\narm. M\u2019Ginley wasn\u2019t looking at a paper packet this time.\n\n\u201cYou go heeled; don\u2019t blame ye,\u201d he blustered. \u201cWhy pull a gun on me?\nThey\u2019re searchin\u2019 your cabin.\u201d\n\nHe told this with the air of one revealing a previous secret.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t find nothin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot in mine,\u201d Drake grated, \u201cbut elsewhere, perhaps. You sit still. We\u2019ve\nbeen playing blind man\u2019s buff overlong. You sit still. This is loaded, you\nold fraud. You figure on holding out, hey? Look me in the eye, in ten\nminutes, and maybe you\u2019ll change your mind.\u201d\n\nM\u2019Ginley quivered. He was gross mountain of a man, and shaking like jelly.\n\n\u201cTen minutes. What you mean? Why--\u201d\n\nDrake rose.\n\n\u201cIf you value your health, sit tight. If you don\u2019t, I play a hard game.\nI\u2019ve an ace in the hole. A neat little ace, isn\u2019t it, in its shoulder\nholster. Sit where you are.\u201d\n\nThe old man watched him as he walked, cat footed, to the stair, and as he\nslowly disappeared down it.\n\n\u201cSome one is goin\u2019 to catch plain hell,\u201d said he, \u201cbut it won\u2019t be me,\nM\u2019Ginley. Mebbe, when they finish their rough stuff there\u2019ll be a nice\ncorpse for Scotland Yard and--what\u2019s hid below for M\u2019Ginley.\u201d\n\nBut M\u2019Ginley was not down in the alleyway; and it was there that things\nwere due to happen.\n\nFirst the old captain\u2019s voice, as he cried through the thin partition\nbetween Drake\u2019s cabin and Quayle\u2019s:\n\n\u201cCome here, for God\u2019s sake, Cray! I found somethin\u2019...\u201d\n\nCray, running in from Drake\u2019s cabin, saw a velvet covered case, long,\nnarrow, bound with precious metal.\n\nThe captain laughed in relief.\n\n\u201cGot our man.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere--where\u2019d you find that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere!\u201d The captain kicked a disreputable handbag. \u201cIn the lining, sewn\nin. I felt it, first shot. Now--\u201d\n\n\u201cOpen it, open it,\u201d Cray urged. \u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s locked some way; but--\u201d\n\nOld Bain\u2019s strong fingers wrapped themselves about the slim thing of metal\nand velvet. The cords of his wrists stood out for a moment. Then the case\nwas open, cracked like a walnut shell. It was empty. The captain glared at\nthe fragments in his hands. Cray, leaning closer, muttered:\n\n\u201cNever mind. Hang on to that. It\u2019s evidence, ain\u2019t it? Quayle--he\u2019ll tell\nmore, when them detectives get after him. He\u2019ll talk. Man can shorten his\nstretch that way. Unless--\u201d he thrust his face close to the captain\u2019s\n--\u201cunless we find them diamonds, ourselves. Then, this\u2019d do for Quayle;\nthey\u2019d take him on the strength of this. And we\u2019d--\u201d\n\n\u201cTo hell with the diamonds!\u201d In the old skipper\u2019s voice was relief.\n\u201cThis\u2019ll do for me. You keep your gab shut, mister. The least you know the\nbest, I\u2019ve got Quayle locked in my cabin. He\u2019ll stay there. If trouble\ncomes aboard, it comes for him, personal. Not me, nor you, if you\u2019re wise.\nYou stop snooping round for them diamonds. I won\u2019t have it, I tell you.\nFirst thing there\u2019ll be a murder--another murder.\u201d\n\nCray, his voice edged, face pale, sneered:\n\n\u201cChanged your tune, hey? Now you found this useless junk, you figure\nyou\u2019ll let them diamonds go, hey? But you figure without Cray. I\u2019ll have\nthis ship apart, if need be, but I\u2019ll lay hands on them stones. I\u2019ll--\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll go easy!\u201d Captain Bain thundered. He was becoming himself rapidly\nnow. \u201cYou\u2019ll keep quiet. There\u2019s others besides Quayle can be locked in\ntheir cabins, and nothing said of it. And I\u2019m master of this ship, by\nGod!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if--\u201d Cray smiled, though he was still under tension, although that\nsmile was not a pleasant one. \u201cIf I told you the truth, would you sing\nsmall, I wonder?\u201d\n\n\u201cTruth? My God! Truth?\u201d the badgered skipper rasped. \u201cYou tell the truth?\nWhat in hell are you, to tell the truth?\u201d\n\n\u201cA detective,\u201d said Cray softly, \u201ca detective.\u201d\n\nThe captain stared, at first unbelieving; then he wilted. Too many little\nthings on Cray\u2019s side. The chances were that he might be. Certainly he\u2019d\nacted like one at times. And if he were, what of the _ Cora_, of her\nsecret sins?\n\n\u201cA detective?\u201d he gasped.\n\nFrom behind Cray came another voice; the cabin door swung open.\n\n\u201cA detective? That\u2019s fine; for there are two of us, then, my dear Cray.\u201d\n\nIt was Drake. He had his gun. In that tiny cabin a gun in the hand meant\nmastery. Drake closed the door after him. His gun covered Cray. He\ndisregarded the old captain. Indeed, old Bain hadn\u2019t an ounce of trouble\nmaking left in him. He was a crushed man. Not one detective, but two! Not\none man, who might conceivably be bribed, but two, each knowing his little\nimmigrant game, and, what was worse, each knowing that the other knew. He\nslumped down on the single bunk. He stared from Cray to Drake, from Drake\nto Cray. He shook his gray head sadly.\n\nCray, snarling, turned on him.\n\n\u201cA hell of a captain! Don\u2019t you see his game? His turn to hang on to them\ndiamonds. He figures we\u2019ll search his room next; likely found out I\u2019d been\nsearching it. He\u2019s desperate.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd a strong man, Cray, which you are not.\u201d\n\nDrake reached out suddenly with his left hand, caught both Cray\u2019s thin\nwrists, brought his hands together. Then with his right hand he laid his\nrevolver on the bunk.\n\n\u201cWhich you are not, Cray, my man,\u201d said Drake.\n\nThe captain heard steel jingle, then saw it flash. He heard a faint click.\nDrake turned to him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll adjourn to your cabin, Captain. This is a bit crowded.\u201d\n\nGlumly the old skipper obeyed. Cray stood there, handcuffed, silent now,\nas if with the snapping of the steel handcuffs had gone from him his last\nchance.\n\nThey stumbled out into the alleyway, Drake\u2019s steady hand on Cray\u2019s elbow.\nAs Cray walked along, men eyed him. He scowled at the first; his face was\nblank as he passed a second. But when the third man stared, he smiled\ncockily. He was on parade and would be on parade until Drake and his kind\nhad done their best, or worst. He must act out his part, confidence in\nevery look, every gesture. That was his code; he would follow it.\n\nDespite the reason for his captivity, there was a certain desperate\ngallantry about Cray, as Drake led him off, handcuffed, to the captain\u2019s\ncabin. He even managed to whisper, as they climbed the steep iron stairway\nto the boat deck:\n\n\u201cA pretty job, Drake; if your feet didn\u2019t look it, nobody\u2019d take you for a\ndick. Only thing is you got the wrong man.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave I?\u201d Drake asked. \u201cHave I? Maybe it\u2019s Quayle should be wearing\nthese.\u201d\n\nCray kept silent at that, as if reluctant to tell; as if, now the enemy\nhad appeared in his true form, he were changing his whole tune; as if\nthose under the law\u2019s suspicion must close up their ranks and stick\ntogether.\n\n\u201cQuayle--there he is in the cabin,\u201d Drake went on. \u201cI\u2019ll be bound, he\u2019ll\nbe glad to see us. You see, Quayle\u2019s my partner, Cray.\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nDrake and the old captain were alone. Quayle had taken Cray away, had\nlocked him up, was keeping an eye on him. Drake had remained with Bain. He\nwas talking jerkily, as if thinking back over this business, partly\nbecause he rather plumed himself on the way it had been managed and partly\nbecause he feared, should he stop, what would follow. Old Captain Bain,\nthere, lips moving, eyes downcast was probably going over the sins of a\nlong and pettily wicked life. Probably, as soon as he got the chance, he\u2019d\npour out a flood of confessions and would incriminate himself hopelessly\nin a dozen dark matters.\n\nDrake, a one idea man, busy with that one idea, didn\u2019t have time, or, to\ndo him justice, inclination for the r\u00f4le of father confessor to the\ncaptain of the _Cora_. So he talked, like a man talking against time,\nelliptically, as things came into his head. And the captain half\nlistening, heard:\n\n\u201cBegan at Dip\u2019s American Bar. Bless you, we at the Yard have known your\nlittle game for years, Captain. Began at Dip\u2019s, when this robbery thing\nbroke, we traced a motor car within a mile of his place. From then on,\nwell, it was chance and luck and, if I may say it, psychology. We came\naboard, Quayle and I, separately. We looked about, used our eyes, wormed\nin where we could. We had no idea what the man was like, what he had done\nbefore. We just played a hunch that he was aboard. Began with you--\n\n\u201cRemember that little note I brought you, ostensibly from Dip? Well, that\ntold me a lot. Bless you, Bain, you aren\u2019t the murdering, thieving sort. I\nruled you out, right then. But, to go on. You remember when the thing\nbroke aboard? That first message?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the old man nodded glumly, \u201cI won\u2019t forget. \u2019Twas as if some big,\nhorrible eye was lookin\u2019 all over, slow but steady. An\u2019 I knew that sooner\nor later it\u2019d stop on us; and then, o\u2019 course--\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d Drake laughed, hastily breaking in, \u201cthat was the intention. I\narranged for that wireless. Scotland Yard? Well, we at the Yard don\u2019t\nbroadcast what we know, unless we want it known for a damned good reason.\nI had that wireless sent. Fixed it up in the hour I had between trailing\nthe car to Dip\u2019s and coming aboard here. That was my bombshell.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut--\u201d the captain stared at him, puzzled--\u201chow\u2019d you--you didn\u2019t know it\nwas Cray you wanted?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I wanted was a disturbance. If he wasn\u2019t in the business he\u2019d\nperhaps talk. If he hadn\u2019t talked, I could fulfill that omission and blame\nit on him. I wanted every manjack aboard here to know that diamonds had\nbeen stolen, that Scotland Yard--they don\u2019t sign themselves that way, I\nmight confess--were on the trail. The rest--well, ever throw a rock into a\npool? The ripples follow each other to shore. The rest was plain Cray. I\u2019d\nstruck it lucky. Those other messages--he made \u2019em up, every one.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why--why?\u201d The Old Man was incredulous.\n\n\u201cHis game.\u201d Drake laughed. \u201cFirst half of the voyage, well, Cray was lying\nlow. He knew his job, you see. He figured on passing as the regular\nwireless man; but he didn\u2019t know his ship, or its company, and he didn\u2019t\nlike that company, when he looked \u2019em over. So he carried the necklace in\nhis pocket, like a pipe or a handkerchief. Well, the day after that first\nbombshell of a message came, he felt for the diamonds--and they were\ngone.\u201d\n\n\u201cGone?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, never mind how.\u201d\n\nDrake got up, walked across to the old skipper of the _Cora_, flipped one\nagile hand across his vest and dangled his watch, chain and seals before\nhis eyes.\n\n\u201cLike that,\u201d Drake laughed. \u201cWell, to get on, there he was, this Cray,\nwith those jewels gone and nothing for his pains. So he began to get\nmysterious messages. Bit by bit suspicion formed, centered, first on this\none, then on that one. You played right into his hands, Captain. You had\nme worried. I was afraid you two would run out of suspects before we made\nour landfall.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean he deliberately had me on?\u201d The captain shook his head. \u201cNo--if\n\u2019twas just theft--but murder--You mean this man let me think we had a\nmurderer aboard, let me know it, when he could have kept it dark--and him\nthe guilty one? Man don\u2019t tie his own hang-man\u2019s knot, mister, not even to\nget back diamonds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was no murder.\u201d Drake laughed, again. \u201cThat was just his artistic\ntouch. No fool, Cray. He knew you\u2019d rise to it. But you worried him. He\nwanted to search every last cabin, but he also wanted to make the job hang\nout till the last moment, in case you might show a rush of brain to the\nhead and get to suspecting him. Well, you did it as he planned, between\nyou. Until, well, there were two of us left, Quayle and myself. Cray was\ngetting scared by now. So, when he searched Quayle\u2019s cabin yesterday, he\nplanted the box that those diamonds had been in when he lifted them. Then\nhe worked things so that you would find it, not him.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why?\u201d\n\nDrake stared at him. What use going on like this? How could this man, who\nbut half listened, understand, when even he saw some things but vaguely?\nYou threw a straw into the water, then a dozen more. If one of them taught\nyou anything of drift or eddy, you were content. When he spoke again his\nvoice was crisp and incisive.\n\n\u201cThat fight. A fake of Quayle and me, in case Cray suspected us of working\ntogether, as he did, eh? Just a precaution. It bothered him, as other\nthings did, too. His problem was twofold. Those stories, you see; the\nwireless messages he was making up--they worked on him in the end, as well\nas on you. He almost believed them, believed that they might have some\naccidental truth in them. And, of course, he wanted his loot back. Safety\nand loot; two ends to gain. If you had it, it was as good as his, for he\u2019s\nsmooth and you--well, the thing\u2019s plain, isn\u2019t it? Notice how he gave in\nat the end? No gunplay. Clever men don\u2019t go in for that. Amateurish, that\nsort of thing. Watch the papers later on and you\u2019ll see how Cray fights\nthrough his mouthpiece. Good criminal lawyers are rich men.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why all this?\u201d the captain growled. \u201cYou knew in mid-Atlantic that he\nwas your man. You had the stuff and could have nabbed him easily then and\nthere.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my game a man never stops learning,\u201d Drake told him. \u201cYou may believe\nme, or not. Your ship said, \u2018Hush.\u2019 I wanted to make her talk, and Cray\ndid it for me, eh? I wanted to see what he\u2019d do and how he\u2019d do it. A\nclever rogue he proved, but too imaginative.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you raised hell with us, with me. Let me run round like a fool.\u201d\n\nThe captain of the _Cora_ bit his lip, for who was he, standing in a\nslippery place, to antagonize this detective. Drake looked at him\npityingly for a moment.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re worried. You\u2019re saying, \u2018Now Drake\u2019ll begin on me.\u2019 The answer is,\nof course, Drake won\u2019t. I\u2019ve known and the Yard\u2019s known, for years. If\nwe\u2019d wanted to, we could fill a gaol with you and your like; but what\u2019s it\nto us if now and then some petty thief gets away? Men like that Liverpool\nrat. It\u2019s the big, fat, long whiskered, clever rats we\u2019re after. When they\ncome drifting along, flying the country, we know where to look.\u201d\n\nHe turned toward the door.\n\n\u201cYou run our rat trap, Captain. Why in the world should we spring it?\u201d\n\nThe door opened as he put his hand on the knob. The fat engineer,\nM\u2019Ginley, crowded in. He laid something that gleamed and glittered on the\nlittle table. Beside this he methodically piled brown paper, broken wax\nseals, bits of cut and knotted string.\n\n\u201cYe\u2019ll bear witness,\u201d said M\u2019Ginley to the captain, \u201cye\u2019ll bear witness,\nI\u2019m an honest man. There it all is, Mr. Drake, everything ye gave me. I\u2019m\nan honest man; and besides, there\u2019s a ship comin\u2019 up astern flyin\u2019 the\nblue ensign, with the Canadian coat-of-arms in the fly of it. I\u2019m an\nhonest man. When they board us, ye\u2019ll tell \u2019em so, doubtless?\u201d\n\nBut Drake was not listening. Bending over the table, he was brushing coal\ndust from the Varnavosk necklace.\n\n                                 THE END",
