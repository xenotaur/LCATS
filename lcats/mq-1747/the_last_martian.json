    "body": "Peetn drew his cloak more firmly about his furry shoulders as the sun\nbegan to sink through the Martian sky and the wind throbbed a deeper\nnote in the gathering darkness. He stood gazing silently as the fading\nlight painted the sky in somber colors, preparing to disappear for\nanother night of screaming wind and penetrating sub-zero cold.\n\nHe watched until the twilight deepened to purple and then stalked\nlaboriously into the wind, up the gentle slope toward the little hollow\nwhere he went each night.\n\nHis tall, articulated form strode across the dusty plain. By the time\nhe had reached the foot of the bank the sky was totally blank, except\nfor the stars, and he could barely propel himself forward against\nthe raging world-wide currents of atmosphere. The last few yards he\ncrawled on his bellyplates. He tumbled into the central hollow and lay\nexhausted, his lungs sucking in and out--\n\nThe cry of a Martian _odlat_ would not be audible to human ears, but\nthe screech which emanated within an inch of Peetn's ear-cupulas\nsent paralyzing waves of terror washing to the tip of his spiny\ntail. He skirled in agony as inch-long teeth crunched savagely into\nhis shoulder, and the _odlat_, startled, let go. Peetn's tentacles\nshot beneath the flapping folds of his cloak and the night-dark was\nshattered in a hissing blaze of light. The headless corpse of the\n_odlat_ thudded to the ground. Black reaction smote Peetn a blow\nsomewhere inside, and the Martian lost consciousness.\n\nIt was after midnight that he awoke to the agonizing throb of his\npoisoned shoulder. His faculties returned somewhat, and he crawled\npainfully over to a little niche in the rocks, where he kept his scant\nstores. Extracting a few pieces of twisted root which had a slight\nmedicinal quality, he plugged the holes left by the _odlat's_ fangs.\nSoon, under the soporific influence of the whining wind, he dropped off\ninto a feverish, agitated sleep.\n\nThe Martian awoke just before noon of the next day and found that the\ncrude poultices he had applied to his wounds had been more effective\nthan he had expected. The shoulder still hurt, but with the gentle ache\nof healing tissues rather than the savage bite of newly-torn nerves.\nThe effect of the _odlat_ poison had worn off, and outside of a slight\nweakness and dizziness, Peetn felt nothing amiss in his interior. He\nslowly unwound from where he lay and stretched to his full height.\n\nThe body of the _odlat_ lay where it had fallen the night before,\nheadless and beginning to stiffen. The dominant race of Mars could use\nlittle of this altogether useless and dangerous beast, namely the ears\nand eyeballs, and if the animal were not too old, the tail. This fierce\nold reprobate was entirely worthless therefore, and Peetn dragged it\nout into the desert and threw it into a pit. It could not be left lying\nnear his hollow to draw other _odlats_ to the spot.\n\nHe returned from his errand and prepared for another day at his\nappointed duties.\n\nThe routine of caring for a Martian water-station is neither\ncomplicated nor arduous, being hardly more than a daily inspection\ntour. No Martian alive understood the methods or mechanisms which drew\nand pumped water from the massive ice-cap into the pool of the colony;\nno one could alter the flow of liquid through the pipes, or shut it\noff, for the valves had long ago corroded into their seats. Even the\ninspection was a mere gesture.\n\n\n\nPeetn always started his rounds in the underground pump room, partly\nbecause most of the machinery was there, but mostly because of a\nsubconscious certainty that there something was wrong. Somehow the\nconglomeration of squeaks, hisses, and shudders suggested things\nthat shouldn't be. Day after day he had gone over the maze of pipes\nand cylinders, looking for a dreaded break, but always he found\neverything the way he had left it the night before. He couldn't know of\noilless bearings burning slowly out during the centuries. The Martian\nartificers had built for incredible durability in that long-gone age of\nMartian glory, but they had not anticipated the mining of the last drop\nof oil or the last flake of graphite, which had occurred millennium\nbefore Peetn's time.\n\nOnce again he began to go over the machinery which he didn't vaguely\nunderstand. In the center of the floor squatted a huge, inscrutable\nmass of metal from which plumed the beginning of all the pipes. Peetn\ntraced with his sight organs the spidery lengths of hard, grey tubing\nto where they disappeared into the housings of the chugging pumps. It\nwas the pumps which emitted the disturbing noises most of all. Peetn\nstuck his head close and listened to the discords in their tune. It\nsounded like rasping, like two raw bones being rubbed together under\nthe flesh. He shook his bald head sadly and let his tentacle-tips\nflicker lightly over the smooth metal. As long as they didn't stop--\n\nHe watched the four bulky pipes crawl along the floor and up the wall,\nwhere they pushed through the ceiling into the valve-house above. He\nglanced over the gauges, meaningless to him, but still faithfully\nrecording the surge of water passing through the pipes. It had lessened\nby about four-fifths since this station had been in operation, but\nnobody noticed the difference. Those that had seen the greater flow\nwere less than dust these ages past.\n\nHe trudged back up the stairs counting them mechanically, and was in\nthe outer air again. The change from semi-darkness to light brought his\nmultiple eyelids winking shut, screening his sight. He squinted toward\nthe southern horizon, seeing nothing but wastes.\n\nWhat was that?\n\nFrom the tail of his eye he thought he saw a flash of light far out\ntoward the west, but although he gazed at the spot for several minutes,\nit did not repeat. Dismissing it as a result of the glare, he stopped\nand entered the valve-house, which stood in the shadow of the towering\nreservoir.\n\nHe finished his useless routine, touching gently the same things and\nlooking in the same places as every day, and came outside.\n\nThis time it was unmistakable. Something flashed in the sunlight out\nin the desert to the west, a piece of polished metal or glass. Or a\nweapon. Somebody was on the desert!\n\nHe was immediately prompted to run atop the knoll, whistle and wave his\ntentacles so that they would not miss him, but some primal caution held\nhim back until reason took hold of his chaotic mind.\n\nOut there was either a friend or an enemy. If it were a friend, it\ncould only be his relief, and he wasn't due for another three years.\nBesides, he would be coming from the south. Therefore it was an enemy,\nsome members of another colony coming to raid the water station!\n\nBending low, he raced up the hill and threw himself into the central\nhollow, facing west. He drew from its holster the flash gun, which had\nkilled the _odlat_, and cradled it beside him. His eyes strained on\ntheir stalks across the western wastes, ready for the first hint of\nsuspicious movement.\n\nIntra-mural war had again broken out on Mars! It disturbed Peetn to\nhave the first responsibility fall on him, but recollecting the tales\nthat the oldsters used to tell him, he was a little proud too. The\nlittle band of water-station defenders had been heroes in those days of\nthe past, not useless, forgotten automatons. There had been a real and\nvital reason for their bitter existence in the north. Peetn's presence,\nup till now, had been a formality.\n\nFor a long time he lay sweeping the desert before him, waiting for\nanother glimpse of his attackers, until suddenly he realized that\nanother night was near. The sky had already begun to edge toward the\ndark end of the spectrum, and the light was lessening visibly. Peetn\ngrew uneasy as the shadow of the box-like reservoir left its source and\nbegan a sinister march to the horizon behind him. The rising nightwind\nsend cold _odlat_-tongues up and down his spindly back, and although\nhe knew that no living thing could stand on the open desert during a\nMartian night, the coming of darkness brought fear rather than a sense\nof security.\n\n\n\nThe dusky sun touched the western plains and the wind howled higher\nin anticipation of the darkness. Abruptly, from out of the dull glare\nin the west, a figure, small from distance, moved. Peetn's limbs and\ntentacles tensed as he watched, and amazement riveted his gaze.\n\nThat small, chunky, ballooning figure was no Martian!\n\nCarried onward by the wind, staggering weakly on its thick legs, the\nfigure came on, weaving from side to side, blundering over the bare\nrock and hard-packed sand.\n\nPeetn made no move to lift the projector as the thing came within\nrange. Possibly the sight of this apparition had driven all thought of\nit from his mind; or possibly his analytical subconscious had reasoned\nthat all the menace of the unknown attacker had vanished, since this\nwas obviously no raiding Martians from another colony.\n\nWhatever it was, it seemed in no way belligerent. In fact, Peetn\nguessed that the creature was in trouble, possibly dying. It made no\neffort to hold back against the driving wind, as he would have done,\nand the erratic course which it followed bespoke numbed faculties.\n\nThe strange figure passed Peetn's hillcrest hollow a few rods to\nthe north and brought up with a thud against the sheer side of the\nreservoir, where it toppled limply over and lay still on the ground.\nBanks of sand began to accumulate against the windward sides of the\nbloated legs and body.\n\nPeetn hesitated only long enough to jam the flash pistol back into\nits holster, where it would be safe from the blasting sand, before he\nscuttled, bent double, toward the mysterious intruder's prone body. The\nthought that it was a corpse flashed through the Martian's mind, but\nthe chance that a living being lay in travail decided him in favor of\nthe risk.\n\nHe was down on his tentacles and knees when he reached the reservoir\nwall, and he burrowed down behind the inert form for a moment before\nattempting the more arduous trip back with the dead weight dragging\nbehind. He found to his surprise that it was covered by a case of metal!\n\nInch by inch, minute by minute, he conquered the two-score feet back\nto the small safety of his hilltop. Keeping the limp form between\nhimself and the wind, he strained against the uphill drag until finally\nhe topped the crest and slid down into the familiar haven. Dizzy from\nexertion and gulping air and sand indiscriminately, he relaxed on the\nfringes of oblivion while the Martian wind bawled in Jovian defeat.\n\nReturning vigor brought renewed interest in his prize of war, and\nhe raised himself on his bony knees, peering breathlessly into the\ntransparent faceplate of the metal suit. Nausea, fear, and amazement\nflooded his brain at the sight of the alien face which returned\nhis stare with sightless, open eyes. It was the face of a Martian\nnightmare; square, with jutting chin-bone; straight long nose, pierced\nunder the lobes by wide slits; hideous blue eyes with single skin-like\nlids; and a mouth--a long, gaping crack rimmed with soft red flesh and\nfilled with gleaming teeth, like a carnivorous beast's!\n\nAnd that mouth breathed! It was not dead!\n\nPeetn's tentacles fumbled with the unfamiliar drawcatch of the\ncreature's locked faceplate, until with a grating of sand crystals\nbetween metal, it slid out, and he lifted the glass off. A puff of\nevil-smelling vapor flew into the Martian's face, and he recoiled.\n\nThe awful face beneath writhed, and a low groan from the pulpy lips\nmade Peetn's eye-sacs pale in terror. He watched fascinated as the\nreturning light of consciousness slowly dissolved the glaze over the\nbluish eyes. One metal-clad hand raised feebly to the open faceplate\nand then dropped like lead as if the owner had used the last bit of\nenergy in his storm-beaten body for the effort. The monstrosity lay\npanting for breath and making murmuring sounds. Peetn bent closer to\nlisten, submerging his revulsion with curiosity.\n\n\"Water! Water!\" it was saying over and over.\n\nA wave of deep compassion engulfed Peetn's twin hearts as he looked\ninto that twisted face beneath its mat of stiff bristly black fur. He\nrealized instantly that this thing was suffering, probably from lack of\nthe things which kept it alive. He closed the faceplate again to keep\nout the whirling sand and rummaged out the last of his _merrl_ root\nand a small quantity of water, on the chance that his food might be\nsuitable to the alien tastes of this being.\n\nAn avid light sparkled in the cloudy eyes as Peetn held the food and\nwater close, and in a spasmodic burst of energy it grasped the metal\ncontainer and splashed the precious fluid into its sucking mouth.\nPeetn averted his eye-stalks from the horrible, yet pitiful sight. The\n_merrl_ root was snatched from his tentacle and crammed between the red\nlips with revolting smacking sounds and gasps of pleasure.\n\nStrength seemed to flow back into the stranger, and he assayed to sit\nup. He slumped into Peetn's supporting tentacles with a weak grin and\nclosed his eyes, dropping immediately into a deep sleep.\n\nPeetn lay the inert figure back on the ground and gazed fascinated at\nthe face, now relaxed in repose. From whence had this stranger come?\nMars could never have spawned such a creature! This was a being from\nanother world, maybe from _Gamtl_ itself! Peetn thrilled at the thought\nas he lay himself down to a food-and-water-less bed.\n\n\n\nLong, long ago the savants had predicted the death of Mars, the gradual\nwasting away of its ability to support life, until finally the last\nMartian would die alone. They pointed with eagerness and envy in their\ntelescopes at the soft green sphere of the third planet, picturing it\nas the Martian Eden, teeming with life-giving food and water.\n\nSpace ships were built. There was not nearly enough room for the entire\npopulation of Mars aboard, so it was agreed that they should act as\nferries, shuttling back and forth until Mars was evacuated.\n\nThe first contingent departed one day on the long trek to another\nworld, and the people left behind waited with renewed hope for their\nturn to go. Hope turned to uneasiness as a second fleet of ships\nrocketed toward Paradise, many years after the first ones should\nhave returned. A third and fourth fleet followed at ever-lengthening\nintervals, and with ever-lessening numbers, but all vanished into\nobscurity with the same finality.\n\nWeakening civilization soon could no longer strain the necessary\nresources from the perishing planet to send another fleet; Gamtl, the\nlush, life-choked pleasure-laden Paradise, became a myth of the past,\nand then even the myth became dim and half-remembered.\n\nLife was a sodden series of hungry days and frigid nights. The energies\nof each individual were strictly circumscribed to activities designed\nto give his colony one more day, one more hour of life. Birth, when\nit was allowed at all, was limited to the replacement of necessary\npersonnel to carry on the food gathering of the community. All contact,\noutside of occasional meetings between scouts searching for new patches\nof _merrl_ bushes, was lost between the colonies, which had settled\non the dust-covered sites of the ancient cities because of the trickle\nof water which still issued from the massive pipes. Even the sporadic\nraids made on the water stations were abandoned, and as the danger of\nattack lessened, small and smaller numbers of guards were spared from\nthe duties of procuring _merrl_ from the desert wastes, until finally\nonly one made the food-and water-less trip into the northern steppes of\nthe polar region. Every fifth year another was sent to relieve him, but\nthe oldest man in the colony could not remember when one had returned.\nWhat privation, what utter loneliness these martyrs endured would never\nbe known. What acts of heroism they might perform would go forever\nunsung.\n\nPeetn had been very young when he had set out for the far north and\nfive years of Martian hell at the water station, but the two years that\nhad passed so far had left him a dead-hearted, middle-aged Martian.\nWrinkles had appeared on his eye-sacs, and his fur had become sparse\nand gray. His mind, too, had turned gray, had withered from watching\ntoo many sunsets. He came to feel inside that he would never see his\ncolony again, just like the others.\n\n\n\nIn spite of his activity the day before, Peetn was up and about early\nthe next morning and went into the desert for _merrl_. Before he left,\nhowever, he placed the metal container half-full of water beside the\nstill-sleeping figure in the metal suit. An intermittent buzzing sound\nissuing from its mouth startled him, and he opened the faceplate. The\nsonorous sound stopped abruptly with a snort, and the stranger mumbled\na few words and squirmed in his sleep. Peetn hastily but softly closed\nthe lid and ambled off into the sea of rock and sand.\n\nWhen he returned, his visitor was standing shakily on his feet,\nwatching him stilt across the plain toward him. Peetn emptied his\npockets of the succulent _merrl_ he had gathered and faced the stranger\nwith a whistle of greeting, extending a friendly tentacle. It was\ngrasped by the prehensile tip of the creature's queer tentacle and\ngently oscillated up and down. Peetn interpreted the gesture as meaning\nfriendship and enthusiastically entered into the spirit of it, pumping\nthe thick arm up and down until the being cried out. The Martian,\nnoticing that his companion's eyes were fastened on the _merrl_ root\nwhich he had brought, snatched up one of the tubers and offered it to\nhim.\n\nThey broke their fast in genial camaraderie, this decadent Martian and\nhis un-Martian visitant, so utterly divergent in form, so different in\nmany ways. But such is the yearning of loneliness and bewilderment that\nall this was forgotten.\n\nPeetn was about to leave on his daily inspection when a gentle hand\nrestrained him. The stranger was making sounds at him, meaningless\nand unfamiliar, but it was apparent that he wanted Peetn to stay and\nlisten. So the Martian stayed and listened solemnly, strange thoughts\nmilling through his head.\n\n\"I know you're not going to understand a word of this,\" his companion\nwas saying, \"But I'm going to tell it to you, anyway--just for luck.\nMy name is Harrison Clark, late of San Francisco, U.S.A., Earth. I\ncracked up, like a damn fool, in the first rocket to reach Mars about\ntwo hundred miles out there in the desert. My food and water gave out,\nand the air inside my ship was getting bad, so I crawled into my can\nand started out, looking for God knows what! I was about done when\nyou must have found me, for I don't remember anything for a long time\nback. You saved my life, and now I want to do something for you. Got\nany lawns you want mowed, or houses I can haunt? I'll bet I'm quite a\nfright in these parts!\" He grinned broadly.\n\nPeetn listened gravely to this address, and when it was over, he\nextended a tentacle and shook hands.\n\n\"I get it, pal!\" laughed Harry Clark. \"We're friends no matter what I\nlook like. You'd be a sixteen cylinder haunt back on Earth yourself!\"\n\nPeetn disengaged his tentacle-tip and strode off down the slope to the\nsubterranean entrance of the pump room. Clark hesitated a moment and\nthen followed, more slowly because of his wasted strength, Peetn turned\nand waited for him at the head of the steps, and they entered the\ncavern together.\n\nClark could not see for a few minutes in the gloom, and he stood still,\nwhile Peetn, with his more adaptable sight organs, moved about with\nease in the familiar surroundings. The multiple noises which rebounded\nin the enclosed space beat through the Earthman's open faceplate,\nbetraying the secret of the darkly looming masses.\n\n\"Machinery,\" he said softly.\n\nPeetn went through his customary routine, conscious of the stranger's\neyes watching his every move, and conscious also of a pitying wonder in\nthem. They quit the underground room, Peetn gently tugging Clark away\nfrom the four gauges which measured the water-flow through the monster\npipes, and entered the valve-house.\n\nPeetn's tentacles caressed the valve-wheels and giant housings\nreverently--and uselessly--while the stranger once again watched with\ninterest. Peetn was suddenly startled by a gusty, explosive sound from\nthe alien.\n\n\"What a hell of a mechanic you are!\" laughed the Earthman. \"I don't\nbelieve you know the first thing about all this, and yet you're\nobviously the caretaker around here. The pumps down there are in a bad\nway. Why don't you oil them?\"\n\nPeetn stuck out his tentacle and they shook hands.\n\n\"Yeah, we're pals, but I still think you're a bust. Look,\" he walked\nover to one of the valve wheels and grasped it by the rim, \"there's\nhardly a trickle going through the pipes. Why don't you open her up,\nlike this--\" The valve creaked protestingly and moved a fraction of an\ninch under the Earthman's effort. Gauges on the wall quivered slightly\nand advanced an imperceptible amount along their calibrated scales.\n\nPeetn went suddenly berserk. He lashed out with his tentacles and\ncaught Harrison Clark's straining figure about the waist, flinging\nhim across the narrow room with a metallic clangor. He stood over the\ncowering figure, his tentacles poised threateningly. This creature was\nmeddling with the machinery!\n\n\"Hey, wait a minute!\" shouted the shaken Earthman, raising himself on\nan elbow and looking up into the inscrutable face of the Martian. \"I'm\nnot trying to hurt anything! Sorry if I've done anything wrong. Here,\nshake hands!\"\n\nHe extended his hand and reluctantly the Martian took it.\n\nThey went back to the little hollow, Clark limping a bit from his fall.\nPeetn enclosed himself in a shell of reticence after the episode in the\nvalve-house, and it was only by dint of hard labor that the Earthman\nwas able to coax him out of it.\n\n\n\nThe days went by, and sandwiched between them were the Martian nights\nwith their savage fury. Slowly the two mis-matched companions evolved\na crude method of making themselves understood to each other, and a\ndawning comprehension of the incredible state of Martian life came to\nHarry Clark. He spent much time in wandering about the water station,\nand slowly he pieced together the puzzle. He knew that it was water\nwhich was contained in the pipes almost the first day he had been\nthere. The intake pipes burrowed under the ground toward the north\ndirection of the ice cap, while the outlets stretched away to the\nsouth to an unknown destination. This, then, must be some kind of\nintermediary, where the ice of the polar cap was transformed into water\nand then pumped south to some place where it was needed. Examination\nof the huge machine in the center of the pump cavern convinced him\nthat this must be where the ice was turned into water. How the ice was\ntransported over the five hundred miles from the polar cap he could not\ndiscover. Water came out, however, so ice must go in.\n\nThe pumps carried the water up into the high-sided reservoir, from\nwhere it started its journey south after passing through the main\nvalves.\n\nBut something was missing. Where did the trickle of water go? Why was\nit so small? Why had the Martian gone off the deep end when he had\ntried to increase the volume of water flowing through _the_ pipes?\nHe made up his mind to worm the answers out of Peetn at the first\nopportunity.\n\nPeetn's mind was in a turmoil as he grubbed in the desert sands at the\nbase of the stubby, tree-like plant. He mechanically pulled up the\nbulbous roots, tearing them loose, but always leaving enough of a stem\nso that a new one would grow back on, but his thoughts were upon what\nthe stranger had made known to him by the diagram he had drawn in the\nsand. This being was from Gamtl! Gamtl, the mythical Eden, the planet\nto which legend told all good Martians would go some day. Some day, it\nwas said, the ghostly ships of space would return, and all Mars would\nbe happy again. This monstrosity claimed to have come from there. Could\nthis be the time of resurrection which Mars was promised by the old\nmyth? How could this thick-tentacled, hideous-faced being bring Mars\nback to its old lost glory?\n\nSuch were Peetn's thoughts as he approached the water station with his\npockets half full of _merrl_. The now familiar figure of the being from\nGamtl stood atop the knoll beckoning to him.\n\nThey shook hands solemnly after Peetn had dumped his load of food, and\nthe stranger drew Peetn over to a patch of cleared sand. Bending down,\nhe drew with his finger a crude diagram of the water-station, pointing\nto it, and then to the reservoir, pump-cavern, and the valve-house,\nindicating each in the sand in turn. He then drew a line from the\npump-cavern northward, and connected it to a large scrawl which Peetn\ndecided was supposed to represent the ice-cap. He nodded his head in\na gesture which he had learned from the Earthman, indicating that he\nunderstood, and that the diagram was right.\n\nClark then drew a line from the valve-house south. By means of much\npointing and insistent signs, the Martian finally discovered that he\nwished to know where it led, and what was at the end.\n\nPeetn jack-knifed his gangly legs and sank to his knees. The tip of\nhis tentacles traced a picture in the sand. It looked like a series\nof small circles interlinked by little curved lines. Peetn pointed to\nhimself, then at the circles. Then he made eighty-two little dashes in\nthe sand.\n\nThe Earthman understood immediately. So that was it! This water-station\nsupplied a colony of eighty-two Martians with drinking water, vital to\ntheir existence! They must live very far south near the equator, in the\nwarmest zone of the planet, where food and heat were more abundant. Of\ncourse! And Beany was shipped up here as watchman. Clark looked with\nnew respect at the Martian, thinking of the soul-deadening loneliness\nhe must have known. He certainly wasn't much good as a mechanic; why,\nhe couldn't even have known that the flow of water could be increased\nby opening those valves wider! Naturally, he had thought that Clark had\ntried to sabotage the plant when he had laid hands on the machinery.\nThose pumps--it was a wonder that they hadn't frozen stiff long before\nthis.\n\nHarrison Clark made up his mind.\n\nNext morning when Peetn arose, the man from Gamtl was gone. So was a\nthree-day supply of _merrl_ and water.\n\n\n\nIt was eight days later when the Martian emerged from the valve-house\nand saw the tiny figure come trudging out of the west. It was the\nalien, and behind him dragged a curious object, a black, cylinder-like\naffair trundling along on four wheels and pulled by a rope in the\nstranger's hands. Peetn stalked out to meet him and after they had\nshaken hands, he curled a few tentacles about the rope and together\nthey pulled the mysterious object into the water-station. Peetn watched\nwith his curiosity aroused as Clark heaved and grunted the thing down\nthe thirty-one steps into the underground pump room, talking all the\nwhile.\n\n\"You know what this is, Beany, old boy?\" he said. \"It's oil--for the\npumps. It'll take the squeaks out of 'em for a while anyway. It won't\nlast forever, but before it's gone, maybe you and I can figure out\nsomething else. Lucky I had this barrel left on the ship. There!\"\nHe stood up and dusted off his hands. \"If we can get those pumps to\nstop chattering, we can open up the valves and let a _real_ head of\nwater through to your pals. Be afraid to do it with the things in this\ncondition.\"\n\nHe unscrewed the cap and peered in, sniffing. He turned to the Martian\nwith a broad grin.\n\n\"About three-quarters full,\" he announced, marking the level on the\noutside of the drum with his hand.\n\nPeetn, deciding that the mystery had progressed just about far enough\nfor his Martian tastes, stilted over and inserted his tube-like\nproboscis into the hole left by the screw cap, and inhaled. He\nstraightened up abruptly and whistled, tears dropping from his yellow,\nsac-like eyes.\n\nClark laughed excitedly. \"That's oil, you Beanpole! We're going to\nrebuild Mars with that drum! You poor guys must have had a hell of\na time living in this hole,\" he continued, becoming serious and\npensive and indicating the desert with a wave of his hand. \"It would\ntake one of you a life-time to find food enough to live that long.\nYour civilization has sunk right down to rock bottom, but I think\nwe're going to change all that.\" He shook his head doubtfully. \"It's\naccording to how long we can make this oil last. Those machines which\nyour ancestors made are the real McCoy, all right, but God knows how\nlong they've been pounding away dry as a bone. The oil might pour out\nof every crack as fast as we pour it in. Well,\" he finished, shrugging\nhis shoulders, \"there's only one way of finding out!\"\n\nCarefully, lest he spill a drop of the priceless fluid, he filled a\nwater container with the lubricant.\n\n\"Keep your tentacles crossed!\" he shot at Peetn, who looked down upon\nhim from his superior height as the Earthman slowly poured the contents\nof his container into the oil-cup on the main bearing of No. 1 pump. He\nallowed the dregs to drain into the capacious pocket and then bent with\nhands on knees, looking for signs of a leak below.\n\nPeetn followed his every move tensely, wondering whether or not to\nforce a halt to this tampering with the vital machines, but somehow he\ntrusted this monster from Gamtl. He seemed to know what he was about,\nand there _was_ a chance that after he was through the disturbing\nnoises in the machines would be gone. So he watched and waited, always\non the alert to prevent any outright damage. He couldn't see, anyway,\nhow pouring some of that evil-smelling stuff into those little cups\nwould change anything.\n\nAnd then suddenly, the song of the pumps changed! The thumping and\ncreaking lessened to an almost imperceptible amount as a tiny ring of\noil appeared around the periphery of the bearing. The pump rose to a\nnew level of activity, the parts whirling and plunging at a greater\nspeed. Peetn thrilled in surprise.\n\nHis interest increased ten-fold as Clark filled the cups on the\nother three pumps in turn. Each one's voice dropped from a shout to a\nwhisper, and all chugged with more vigor under the relaxing influence\nof the lubricating oil. Peetn trembled all over as he noted that\nthe protesting groans which had worried him so were gone. This was\nunbelievable! This stranger from Gamtl was indeed a friend!\n\n\"Our work isn't done, Beany,\" said Clark, as he dumped what was left of\nthe oil back into the drum and wiped his hands in the sand. \"The really\nimportant part is yet to come. This is just preparing; now we've got to\nknock those rusty valves loose from their eye-teeth!\"\n\nHe screwed the barrel-cap back into place and, followed by Peetn whose\nanimation was visibly increased over his usual lethargic, fatalistic\nstate, he trod the stairs into the open air.\n\nThe Earthman gave a preliminary tug or two at the valve-wheels, and\nthen muttered under his breath. Peetn scowled inwardly. It was not\ngood, tampering with the machines. Then the Martian went all weak and\nfluttery inside as the stranger picked up a short metal bar which\nhad been lying in a dusty corner and began banging on the tops of\nthe machines! He was upon Clark like a flash, and the tendons in the\nEarthman's arms cracked agonizingly as the Martian giant wrested the\nbar away from him in mid-blow. Clark relaxed as the tense tableau\nthreatened to continue for a protracted length of time.\n\n\"Look, Beany,\" he said pleadingly. \"I'm only trying to jar the rust\nloose inside. Gimme back that thing and let me alone. I know what I'm\ndoing.\"\n\nThe Martian, of course, didn't understand a word, and he stood toying\nwith the length of metal rod, his yellow eyes blank and inscrutable.\nThen with a sudden gesture, he handed it back to Clark and extended a\ntentacle.\n\n\"He trusts me!\" gasped the Earthman as he pumped the furry limb up and\ndown enthusiastically.\n\nUsing the bar as a lever, he twisted the spoked wheel around several\nturns, watching the meters on the wall as the valve grated wider and\nwider. The indicator crept up and up, revealing the increased flow to\nClark's anxious eyes. The noise from the pumps below drifting through\nthe open archway thundered with new energy to catch up with the added\ndrain on their powers. Trembling with triumph, he disentangled the bar\nfrom the spokes and turned the handle on the petcock from which Peetn\ndrained their drinking water every morning. A stout stream as thick\nas his thumb spattered to the ground with a heavenly gurgling sound.\nPeetn's knees must have given way at the sight, for he folded up and\nsat down on the floor ungently, his eyes glued to that stream of life\nwhich issued from the pipette.\n\n\n\nSeveral weeks later, Harry Clark stood by with an amused grin on his\nface as Peetn tweedled excitedly to the three Martians who had come\nstilting out of the south the evening before. The whistling of the\nMartians was less than gibberish to him, but he got the idea from the\nvarious tentacle-wavings and yellow-eyed stares in his direction that\nPeetn was giving them the dirt about himself.\n\nAnd that was exactly what Peetn was doing.\n\n\"The monster is from Gamtl, the Paradise of the old legend,\" he was\nwhistling. \"Many days ago the wind blew him into the water-station,\nsick and dying from lack of life essentials. He was clad in the strange\nmetal suit which you still see upon him. He is a very strange and\nalien being. It seems inexplicable, but I believe that he understands\nmore about them than we for whom they exist. Well, one day in the\nvalve-house, he laid tentacles on one of the machines, and I had to\npull him bodily away from it. His interest did not carry him quite so\nfar as that in succeeding days, but about a week later I arose in the\nmorning to find him gone!\n\n\"His return, which I didn't expect, was the queerest sight I ever saw.\nHe came across the desert at about midday, from the direction he first\ncame, dragging behind him a cylindrical object which I later found to\nbe hollow and filled with a very amazing liquid. He took this container\ndown into the cavern of the chugging machines and unscrewed a small\ncircular section in the top. I smelled its contents; it smelled like\nthe juice of the _merrl_ plant when it was crushed, a very unpleasant\nodor, I assure you. It also had the same consistency and texture, as I\ndiscovered surreptitiously afterwards.\n\n\"Well, he poured some of it into the chugging machines, and the noises\nwhich they had been making--stopped! It was the most amazing thing I\nhave ever experienced. He seemed to wield some un-Martian control over\nthem!\n\n\"Then he did a thing which makes me shudder to recount! He picked up\na bar of metal half as long as my tentacle and began belaboring the\nmachines from which I had pulled him a few weeks before! Quickly I\nstopped him, but something, perhaps the memory of how he had quieted\nthe chugging machines, told me that this being could be trusted, and\nthat he knew what he was doing. I--I took an awful chance. I squirm\ninside when I think of what might have happened if my trust in this\nGamtlian had been misplaced. I gave him back the bar and allowed him to\ncontinue!\n\n\"He stopped banging before he broke anything, and then he did a\npeculiar thing. He turned the outer edge of the round machines in\nthere,\" Peetn indicated the valve-house, \"so that the whole top moved\naround itself. Then the miracle happened.\"\n\n\"Yes, go on,\" twittered the other one excitedly. \"What did he do?\"\n\nPeetn paused for a moment to gather weight, and then proceeded\nsolemnly. \"He opened the little machine from which I draw my drinking\nwater, and a stream shot forth as thick as my tentacle and spattered\nall about the room!\" He allowed himself to exaggerate. \"An unbelievable\nquantity of water poured out in the short space of time that I watched\nit.\"\n\nThe newcomers seemed slightly disappointed at the tale Peetn told,\nexpecting to hear about gigantic super-Martian operations by the\nstranger from Gamtl, the Martian spirit-world.\n\n\"Why that's just about what happened down at the colony, about the\nwater, I mean,\" said one of them. \"All of a sudden a flood came\ngushing out of the supply pipe and overflowed the pool and spreading\nout over the surrounding desert. A funny thing, too, was the way that\nthe _merrl_ plants grew where the water had spread. When we left,\nour colony had a full fifteen days' stock, and all of it was gathered\nwithin a five-minute walk of the caves!\"\n\nPeetn had a faraway look in his usually inexpressive, yellow eyes. A\nquiver was noticeable in his whistle as he replied.\n\n\"Can this be the fulfilment of the old legend of Gamtl?\" he asked.\n\"Already we owe this alien much; our lives have been made easier\nto live. Who knows, with the awful burden of food-gathering and\nwater-conserving lifted from our colony, we may be able to gain back\nsome of the lost glory of our ancestors; may again be able to build\nwater-stations and flash-guns! Yes, my friends, the day that stranger\nstaggered into this water-station was the first day of the rebirth of\nMars!\"\n\n\n\nHarrison Clark, for the first time since he had crashed on the Martian\ndesert in the rocket, did not dream so longingly of Earth as he lay\nin the little hollow he had come to know as home. He had work to do\nhere. A feeling of mingled exultation and determination had possessed\nhim when Peetn had shown him the liquid which resulted from crushing\n_merrl_. It was a very heavy and durable vegetable oil, quite capable\nof continuing the job of lubricating the machinery after his petroleum\nwas gone. Mars could be re-awakened with it; the task was his.\n\nThen, too, some day another rocket might arrive from Earth, one that\nwouldn't crash. The American Rocket Society wouldn't give up because\ntheir first rocket failed to return. In examining the pumps a day or so\nago, he thought he found what made them go. A small, ridiculously small\nbox, no larger than his two fists fastened to the eccentric. Obviously\natomic power, or something as efficient and ever-lasting. Earth could\nuse something like that.\n\nA sense of warmth and friendship suffused him, in spite of the frigid\nwind which blew all around, as he thought of the Martian monsters which\nlay sleeping beside him. They were _his_ people now! For when Peetn had\nstopped whistling to them, one by one they had filed past, and every\ndamn one had shaken his hand!",
