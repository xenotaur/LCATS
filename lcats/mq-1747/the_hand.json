    "body": "Alice McNearby was washing breakfast dishes and looking out the\nkitchen window at the November sky when she first spied Dobie. The way\nhe was sneaking up to the house she knew he had killed something.\n\nShe dried her hands on her apron and tried to put down the suspicion\nthat gnawed at the edge of her mind as she went to the door. During\nthe past month Dobie had killed a cat, a pheasant, two rabbits and a\nfield mouse and it seemed it would be only a question of time until he\ngot one of the chickens or even one of the suckling pigs. That would\nbe all Mac would need to throw one of his wild spells and he'd\nprobably take a gun to Dobie as he had threatened to do. To make it\nworse, Dobie seemed to know how Mac felt and often growled at him. Mac\ndidn't growl back but the look in her husband's eyes was enough to\nconvince her Dobie's continued existence was in doubt.\n\nIt was a wonder to Alice that Mac hadn't done away with him already,\njudging from the comfort she derived from the dog. Dobie never\nfretted, never whined and seemed so appreciative of everything she did\nfor him. She had scolded him for his killing but found herself unable\nto put her heart in it because he seemed to love it so. Instead, she\nalways managed to clear any bones away before Mac returned from town\nor came up from the barn and she was thankful he seemed as yet unaware\nof the brown dog's hunting nature.\n\nNow it appeared she'd have to cover up for the dog once again and she\nopened the door. Dobie was under a bush half way across the barn yard,\nhis kill still in his mouth. He was circling around, and she knew\nhe'd soon be on his stomach enjoying his feast.\n\n\"Dobie!\" she called in a low voice, hoping it would not carry to the\nbarn.\n\nDobie's ears came up. He looked her way.\n\n\"Dobie!... Come here, Dobie!\"\n\nThe dog was undecided, looking at her, unmoving for a moment. Then his\ntail started flicking, he lowered his head and came up to her.\n\nThen she saw what he had in his mouth and her blood stopped and only a\ngreat effort on the part of her heart started it going again.\n\nIt was a human hand, blood still oozing from the severed wrist.\n\n\"_Dobie!_\"\n\nThe way she said it, the way she looked--something made the dog drop\nthe hand. It fell to the ground, limp, palm down.\n\nDobie, head hung, tail down, ventured forward, nuzzled her hand. But\nAlice could not tear her eyes from the thing on the cold ground. She\nhad cared for Dobie like a baby ever since someone dropped him off\nout in the country and she had adopted the name Dobie because a\npassing child had called him that and it seemed like a good name ...\nand she loved him.\n\nBut this, this hand. That was too much.\n\nShe looked around, saw a milk pail, put it open end down over the hand\nand carried two large rocks from the garden border to put on top to\nsecure it. She didn't want it to be gone when she brought Mac back to\nsee it.\n\nShe heard her ring on the telephone--rather early for Mrs. Swearingen\nor Mrs. Abbey wasn't it?--but ignored it. There was something else she\nhad to do and do quickly. For the first time in months she felt\nthankful for Mac's presence. Surely he would know what to do. Though\nit was cold, she was unmindful of the fact that she did not wear a\ncoat as she hurried to the barn; she was thinking instead that perhaps\nshe should have answered the phone in case it might have been someone\nother than her women friends, possibly something in connection with\nthe severed hand. She shuddered as she remembered how it had looked.\n\nAlice found Mac in the loft. He had a forkful of hay over the opening\nwhen he saw her below. He stopped, narrowed his eyes before he slowly\nbrought the hay back to the loft floor and leaned on the pitchfork.\n\n\"Dobie's found something,\" she said and wished her voice hadn't\nquavered so.\n\nMac spat a blob of tobacco on the floor above her. \"He's a no-good\ndog,\" he said. \"Scares the pigs. Always sneakin' around. Ought to be\nrid of him. Should have got 'round to it before this. What did he\nfind?\"\n\n\"A hand.\" She swallowed ... and shivered.\n\n\"A what?\"\n\n\"A hand. A human hand.\" She suddenly took pride in the fact that she\nwas telling him something he didn't know and that he was interested.\n\"I don't know where he got it.\"\n\nMac put down the fork and lowered his burly frame over the edge of the\nopening and came down the ladder without a word. He followed her up to\nthe house and she was thankful Dobie was nowhere around. When he\nkicked over the pail she was gratified to hear his sharp intake of\nbreath.\n\n\"By God!\" he said, staring down at it. Then he flicked it over with\nhis boot. \"By God!\" he said again. Alice had never seen him so\nagitated.\n\nHe turned to her, his eyes narrower than she had ever seen them. \"You\ntake a good look at it?\"\n\nShe nodded, looked down at the way the fingers were bent upward as if\nthe hand were holding an invisible ball. She heard Mac spit, looked at\nhim running his fingers along his stubbled jaw.\n\n\"It ain't human,\" he said. \"Anybody with any sense could see that.\nIt's got six fingers.\"\n\n\n\nJust then the phone rang again. It seemed to come from a long way off\nand Alice hadn't consciously noticed it until her husband said. \"Ain't\nyou goin' to answer the phone?\" And then she went to the door, dazed\nand wondering. She turned before she went in.\n\n\"What are you going to do with it?\" she asked.\n\n\"You just go in and gab with those women folks,\" he said. \"I'll take\ncare of it.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't we call the sheriff?\"\n\nHis eyes came up level with hers. \"We ain't goin' to call nobody. I\ndon't want no trouble. And don't you go talkin' about it with _them_\neither.\"\n\nThe phone was Mrs. Swearingen who told her that she had been trying to\nget her for the last half hour ever since she heard about that ship\nthat crashed and wasn't it awful and that a person wasn't safe in his\nbed asleep any more with these planes flying around and crashing--and\nso far from an airport, too. Mrs. Swearingen was surprised that Alice\nhad noticed no smoke and didn't she know the wreck was closer to the\nMcNearby place than it was to the Swearingens?\n\n\"It's right south of your lower forty on the old Carnahan land, Alice.\nI'd figure it at about a mile from your place. Lots of people down\nthere.\"\n\nAnd then there was the call from Mrs. Abbey who told her she'd come\nfrom the crash site and wasn't it a peculiar plane with those funny\nwindows and that once-broken-one somebody had patched up from the\ninside.\n\n\"The sheriff won't let anybody go near it,\" Mrs. Abbey said. \"He says\nit's a space ship and the army ought to have a look at it first. But I\nsaw him trying to find where to get in. Except for that broken window\nand that crumpled nose it don't look too bad off. Big clouds of smoke\nwere shooting out the tail when I first got there but it's not smoking\nany more. Really, you ought to go down and see it, Alice.\"\n\nAlice told her husband about it. He had gone back to the barn and she\ndidn't see the severed hand anywhere on the way there.\n\n\"So that's where it come from,\" he said. \"Good thing it didn't land\non my place.\" He spat and wiped his mouth with the sleeve of his\noveralls. It always bothered Alice when he did this because the stain\nwas so difficult to get out but she had long ceased trying to change\nhim. \"If it'd landed here I'd of blown it up like a stump.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't we go down and see it?\" Alice asked, knowing too late she\nhad phrased the question the wrong way.\n\n\"Curiosity killed the cat,\" he said, and there was the faintest\nglimmer of a smile on his face but it was only fleeting. \"Let\neverybody else go down and I'll get my work done while they're\nstandin' around with their mouths hangin' open. I'm runnin' a farm and\nI aim to run it right.\"\n\n\"I think I'll go down.\" She tried to make it have resolve but didn't\nquite succeed.\n\nHe glared at her and spat again. \"Then git,\" he said. He threw down a\nlarge forkful of hay and she had to jump out of the way. She went\nright after dinner.\n\nShe saw a silver cylinder that looked ever so much like pictures of\nguided missiles she had seen in the newspapers except that this one\nwas bigger than any of them. Its nose was dug she could not tell how\nfar into the earth and some of the metal on the sides was battered and\nbent and the tail was she guessed about a hundred and fifty feet in\nthe air. It was about twenty-five feet across.\n\nThere were clusters of people about and she recognized many of them\nshe hadn't seen for a long time and she was glad she had come because\nit gave her a rare chance to visit; Mac seldom cared for just\nvisiting. She talked to the Blaines, the Purveses, to the Gordon\nchildren whose parents had let them remain at the wreck site even\nafter they had gone home for chores, to the Barfords and Hocholters\nand many others. They asked about Mac and she offered her usual\nexcuses for him.\n\nWhile she was there she saw an army car driven up. She watched while\nsome men got out and went through the roped-off area and pounded and\nscraped on the cylinder and then stood off looking at the tail of it,\nscratching their heads.\n\n\n\nWhen she went home she was surprised to see how far the sun had moved\nacross the sky and hoped Mac wouldn't be upset by her prolonged\nabsence. She was gratified to see that he wasn't in the house. She\npetted Dobie for a while before she went in to stir up the stove and\nprepare supper.\n\nDuring the meal Alice tried to tell her husband something of what she\nhad seen at the wreck site but if he paid any attention to her he\ndidn't reveal it. He had propped up a farm equipment catalogue against\nthe sugar bowl and studied the pages without saying a word. She\nresigned herself to eating in silence with this great hulk of a man\nbefore her and reflected that this night was no different from most of\nthe others. She wondered what it was that made him the way he was, so\nintent on his farm to the exclusion of everything else, including\nhumanity. It was a fetish, an obsession that didn't pay off because\nshe couldn't see that they were better off than the Swearingens or the\nAbbeys or any of the others in the neighborhood.\n\nWhen he was through he simply got up, put on his overcoat and went\noutside. In a few minutes she could hear the car start and knew it\nwould be another lonely evening. Mac would be home when he felt like\nit, reeking of liquor but handling it well. She did not begrudge him\nthese absences because the man obviously needed something to take his\nmind off his work. But she wished she had some comparable escape.\n\nShe had got out her writing board, had settled herself comfortably\nwith pen in hand in Mac's big chair and had even put the date on the\nletter to her mother who lived in Canada when she heard Dobie's\nexcited bark.\n\nShe picked up a shawl on the way to the kitchen, turned on the big\nlight on the windmill and looked out the window. Dobie was in the\nmiddle of the yard barking at something she couldn't see. She went\nout.\n\n\"Dobie,\" she called. \"What is it?\"\n\nThe dog whined and moved about nervously, looking first at her and\nthen at the darkness between the big barn and the machine shed. As she\nsought to pierce the blackness there, a shape moved out from between\nthe buildings and the sudden move caused her to step back. Dobie at\nonce set up loud and ferocious barking.\n\n\"Quiet, Dobie,\" she managed to say, laying a hand aside the dog's head\nand viewing the figure before her. It was a man--at least a man\n_shape_--with hands (she thanked God the creature had both its hands),\na head, neck, shoulders and legs. But the head was a lot larger than a\nman's, there was no hair on it and the eyes were smaller, the nose\nlonger and the mouth a narrow slash across the face. The neck was\nshort, the shoulders thin and the legs and arms were spindling. She\nsaw that each hand had six fingers. Across the narrow shoulders had\nbeen flung what looked like a carpet and from beneath this fell a\nskirt that went to the knees, held to the body with a metal rope belt\njust under his ribs. The shoes were enormous things for such pipestem\nlegs--until she saw they were soft and furry and that this gave them\ntheir size. For a moment she almost laughed because he presented such\na grotesque figure, but she did not dare. The creature spoke.\n\n\"Good evening, Mrs. McNearby,\" it said in a not unpleasant, whistling\nvoice and Alice wondered how it could talk so well to her.\n\n\"I come from the crashed ship. You know of it, of course. You were\nthere this afternoon.\"\n\nAlice was on the point of asking how he knew she had been at the wreck\nsite when he started in again.\n\n\"We have traced the severed hand of one of our crew to your place\nhere. We came down at considerable velocity when our ship went out of\ncontrol. We were lucky to escape with our lives. But one of us was\nthrown from the ship with such force that his hand was cut off by an\nobstruction on the ship. Your dog happened on the scene before we\ncould find the hand.\"\n\nThe chill of the November night air was beginning to penetrate her\nshawl and Alice could feel a stirring of air on her legs. Dobie moved\nrestlessly at her side but she did not let go of his neck hair for\nfear of what he might do.\n\n\"We need that hand, Mrs. McNearby. Without it the man who lost it will\nbe at a tragic disadvantage among us. That is why we were looking so\nhard for it this morning after the crash. If we can return the hand to\nhim in time it can, through proper treatment, be made as good as new.\nWould you be so good as to return it to me, now, please?\"\n\nThe eyes, though tiny, seemed not unkind, and the alien stood silent.\nShe was moved by his pleas.\n\n\"Mac--that's my husband--has it,\" Alice said. \"I saw Dobie here with\nit and put it under a milk pail and when Mac saw it he said he'd take\ncare of it.\" She hoped she was making sense.\n\n\"Do you know where it is?\"\n\n\"I don't know where Mac put it.\"\n\n\"Would you find it for me, please? I'll wait.\"\n\n\n\nAlice agreed and, wondering what Mac would say if he came home and\nfound the hand gone, started looking for it. But surely Mac would\nunderstand about the hand, she thought. I'll explain to him the\nurgency of it, that one of the aliens needs it to live and be useful.\n\nShe looked in the obvious places, in the storeroom just off the\nkitchen, in the cellar, then in the house itself, in Mac's room and\nthrough his things, and even in the attic, though she knew it couldn't\nbe there. She became frantic then, paced by the alien's necessity for\nhis hand, and did not bother to straighten things up after she looked.\nIt simply couldn't be in the house. But where else? She went out and\ntold the alien she could not find it but that she would look in the\nbarn.\n\nIn the end she could find it nowhere and when she told the alien he\nseemed as disappointed as she.\n\n\"I have seen you searching,\" he said. \"I want to thank you for your\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"I'm awfully sorry,\" she said. \"I don't know where Mac could have hid\nit. When he comes home I'll ask him.\"\n\n\"I'll wait for him,\" the alien said. \"It's imperative we have the\nhand. It is the only thing standing in the way of our leaving your\nplanet. Your husband will know where it is and return it to us.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he will,\" she said, hoping she was right but knowing how\nstubborn Mac could be. Then she got to worrying about what would\nhappen if he would refuse and as she went back to the house with Dobie\nat her side she was overcome with the shakes.\n\nShe did not get her composure back until she had drunk a cup of\nsteaming hot coffee. Then she looked at the clock, saw it was eleven\nand that she had spent nearly two hours looking for the hand. She saw,\ntoo, that the figure was still in the yard, standing there motionless,\nlike something carved out of stone.\n\nHer husband drove in at mid-night and it seemed an eternity between\nthe time the engine stopped and he entered the house.\n\nFrom the way he looked at her he was surprised to find her still in\nthe kitchen.\n\n\"You still up?\" His face was flushed, his tongue thick.\n\n\"Mac,\" she said, not knowing how to begin. \"Where is that hand?\"\n\n\"You still worried about that?\" He took off his coat and threw it on\nthe table.\n\n\"But Mac! They've come after it.\"\n\nHe looked at her dully. \"Who's come after it?\"\n\n\"The aliens--from the ship. There's one of them in the yard. Look out\nthe window.\"\n\nHe turned around and saw the stationary figure in the yard. He took a\ndeep breath. \"So that's one of 'em, eh?\" He laughed in a way that\nchilled her, then went to the cupboard and reached for his shotgun on\nthe wall next to it.\n\nAlice put her hand on his shoulders and he stopped before he touched\nthe gun.\n\n\"Listen, Mac. They need that hand. It belongs to one of their men and\nthey need it because they're going to put it back on and it will be as\ngood as new. Then they're going to leave.\"\n\nHe looked down at her with bloodshot, narrow eyes and she could see\nwhere tobacco had run out of the corner of his mouth and the only\nthing she could think of was what it would look like on the overalls\nwhen she'd wash them.\n\n\"That thing out there,\" Mac said, \"ain't got no business 'round here\nscarin' the pigs and chickens. And I aim to get it.\"\n\n\"I wish you had told me where the hand is,\" Alice said, her eyes\nscalded with tears. \"I tried to find it. I looked everywhere. If I had\nfound it I would have given it to him and now they'd be gone.\"\n\nHe shoved her from him rudely. \"Jest like a woman to do a thing like that.\nAnd without even askin' me.\" He was breathing hard and he moved to the\nwindow to look at the alien again. \"You, out there. You want that hand,\neh?\" He laughed again, then turned to her. \"You looked for it. That's what\nyou said. Well, you jest looked in the wrong place. I hid it good.\" He\nwent over to his coat and withdrew a newspaper-wrapped package from one of\nthe pockets. He unfolded it on the table. It was the hand.\n\n\"Please take it out to him, Mac,\" Alice said. \"He's waiting for it.\"\n\nHis face was sour and his lips a sneer. \"Give it to him, hell,\" he\nsaid. \"Dobie brought it here, didn't he? I've a mind to let Dobie have\nit.\"\n\n\"No, No!\"\n\nMac put his hands on the table, stared down at the hand and shook his\nhead. \"But Dobie don't deserve it.\"\n\nHe picked up the hand and a queasiness prevented Alice from looking\ndirectly at it.\n\n\"It's a matter of time,\" she pleaded. \"Please take it to them. They've\ngot to have it right away or they can't use it. She heard the clink of\none of the stove lids and watched in horror as Mac dropped the hand\nthrough the hole into the fire beneath. She was suddenly sick. During\nit all she could hear was Mac's laughter.\n\n\"Git on upstairs,\" he said a few minutes later. \"Git on up to bed.\"\n\n\n\nAlice looked at him, knowing her face was pale and her eyes wet and\nhating him for what he had done to her and what he had done to the\naliens. But she felt fear, too, because she had never seen him quite\nlike this.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\nHe went over, took down a box of shells from the cupboard. \"What d'you\nsuppose? I'm goin' to run that thing off my place.\"\n\n\"You can't do that!\"\n\n\"You wait and see.\"\n\n\"But he's done nothing to you!\"\n\n\"He's on my property, ain't he? Now you get on upstairs like I told\nyou. Git!\"\n\nAlice went up the stairs engulfed by a feeling of sorrow for the\naliens, particularly for the one that would never get his hand back,\nand filled with fury for her husband.\n\nFrom her bedroom window she could see the alien still standing in the\nyard and she wondered what he would think of them for burning the hand\nand for what Mac was about to do.\n\nShe stood there a long time before the alien moved. She heard the\ndownstairs door open and close and she knew Mac was outside and that\nthe two were approaching each other. The alien finally moved from her\nfield of vision.\n\nListening, she heard the alien's calm, whistling voice but she could\nnot make out what he said. She could only hear the raving of her\nhusband and this she did not want to hear.\n\nWhen the shotgun blast came she jumped as if she herself had been hit\nand once again she was flooded with compassion for the creature from\nanother world somewhere who had come in friendship and who had been\ngiven something hateful in return.\n\nShe went to the window but she could see nothing. She did not dare go\ndownstairs again with Mac in the mood he was in. She sat in an\narmchair at the window looking out into the barn lot illuminated by\nthe lone electric light high in the windmill. And eventually, she did\nnot know when, she fell asleep.\n\nWhen she woke up the day was just dawning and with a rush she\nremembered everything that had happened the night before and she found\nshe had slept through the night in the chair without removing her\nclothes. When she stood up, her muscles screamed protestingly. She\nlooked out into the yard and saw that the light in the windmill was\nstill burning.\n\nShe went to Mac's bedroom, expecting to find him sprawled out across\nhis bed. But his bed had not been slept in. Downstairs she expected to\nfind him, head in hands, asleep at the kitchen table. But he was not\nthere and the shotgun was not in its place on the wall.\n\nShe found the gun on the doorstep. But Mac wasn't in sight. Dobie came\nup to her and nuzzled her hands.\n\n\"Where is he Dobie?\" she asked. \"Where's Mac?\"\n\nDobie turned and trotted before her, looking back at her as if to say,\n\"This is the way.\"\n\nShe found Mac behind the barn.\n\nHe was alive, but in a state of shock, moaning in pain and fear.\n\nHis right hand was missing. Severed neatly at the wrist.\n\nTHE END.\n\n",
