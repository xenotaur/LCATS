    "body": "Charlie Mead, trapper, and Flip Miller, ex-prospector, started a\nforty-day drunk. Charlie just liked the idea. Flip had reasons.\n\n\"In a few hours it'll be wetter'n a swamp duck's gullet,\" said Charlie,\ngrinning behind his whiskers. \"And darker'n West Pluto!\" Charlie\nhad been trapping otters here for five years and accepted the long\nnights as resignedly as the mud, the eternal fog and the heat. He\npoured another glass of _loku_, squinted at its blue sparkle in the\ntube-light. The gray mists swirled through the open door and the raw\nwind whistled through the rusty holes in the wall.\n\nFlip leaned back against the bundles of fur and held up four fingers.\n\n\"To hell with the following,\" he counted, \"I.M.C., radios, fuel\ntanks, and this soggy planet of yours, Venus!\"\n\n\n\nNoted for his wild-goose chases and wilder ideas, Flip Miller was\nalways running into trouble. In fact it was just two months ago that\nthe Space Patrol found him marooned on Pallas. He had one pint of air\nleft when they found him, said he fell out of his plane while looking\nfor diamonds. The Patrol took him to Mars. There, he immediately got\nin a poker game and made a fortune--and immediately got in another and\nlost it all. That is, all except a doubtful map of a Venusian xanite\nmine which nobody else would accept as stakes. Which was his reason for\nbeing here, if Flip ever needed a sane reason for being anywhere.\n\nFor once however his screwball ventures panned out.\n\n\"And I've been here all these years without knowing a billion dollars\nwas in my back yard,\" said Charlie who considered the matter very\nfunny. \"Leastwise it was a billion till--\"\n\n\"Shut up, you blinking old veedle-chaser,\" said Flip. People always\nlaughed at his misfortunes. Maybe it was because he did too....\n\nCharlie's island was in the middle of the Black Swamp. The mine was\na few hundred miles east. Fused with asphalt and deep in the mire,\nthousands of miles from nowhere, it was small wonder it had lain there\nunvisited since its original discovery. The map had passed through the\nhands of sundry dissolute, short-lived sourdoughs till the location\nbecame as dubious as other bar-room talk. It was Flip's luck that the\nmap eventually got around to him. He was probably the only man in the\nsystem who would have believed in it.\n\nFilled with quick visions, he'd figured his treasure up on the spot. It\nwould cost about fifty dollars a ton to get it out of the swamp, smelt\nthe asphalt and ship the ore to Earth. On Earth xanite ore was worth\nover a thousand dollars a ton.\n\nThen the fates ran amuck.\n\nHis plane's fuel tank sprang a leak. Flip lost every drop of the\nreserve that was to carry him back to the mainland. The mainland was\n25,000 miles away. Then his sending set blew a transformer and he\ncouldn't radio for help. Last, while trying to ascertain his position\non the receiving set, he heard that I.M.C.--Interstellar Metallurgical\nCompany--had just opened a gigantic xanite deposit on Mars. The Market\nquoted xanite now at twenty dollars a ton. Venusian xanite suddenly\nwasn't worth swamp water.\n\n\"It shore is too bad,\" continued Charlie with smiling sympathy.\n\n\"You probably wished it on me,\" said Flip, \"so you could have company\non this mildewed damn island.\"\n\nThat was the one blessing in his barrage by malevolent fates--he'd\nglided to Charlie's island and the old fellow, one of many of his kind\nin the Venusian swamps, had placed his metal shack, his canned beans\nand his _loku_ at Flip's disposal. To all of which he was doomed till\nthe supply ship came around after the rains--forty days ahead.\n\n\"I wish one of your pirates would show up,\" mused Flip. \"I might could\nbum a ride out of here.\"\n\n\"Don't wish that, boy,\" said Charlie with quick seriousness. \"I've been\npretty lucky so far but I told you about the fellow who used to be\nhere--he's buried out yonder in the mud. These here Venusian pirates're\nabout the meanest critters you find anywheres.\"\n\n\"They come around during the nights, huh.\"\n\n\"Yeah, when the season's catch is ready for packing. They kill the\nfellow and take his pelts. You quit talking about pirates, boy. They'd\njust as soon skin you as an otter.\"\n\n\"Say! What about this female pirate I heard about on the mainland?\"\n\n\"Captain Vixen? I never seen her--never knew nobody that had. She\ndon't come out here and the natives won't talk about her. But you can\nbet your Sunday space-togs she's behind this swamp raiding--she runs\neverything on the mainland, about ruined the big industries there.\nSupposed to be a native queen back in the hills; hates foreigners. They\nsay she's nursed scorpions and killed men with her fingernails.\"\n\n\"Pretty tough date, huh.\"\n\nAnd now the twilight was coming on, it was starting to rain--and soon\nit would be blackness and constant rain for forty dreary days.\n\n\"Oh, hell,\" yawned Flip. \"And I didn't bring my bathing suit.\" He\njoined Charlie in a drink.\n\n\n\nThe thirty-eighth century Haliburton and the Black Swamp Bacchus were\ndoing nicely with the sixteenth verse of _Lulu Drank Loku on Pluto_\nwhen one of the more technical gestures necessary to the famous ditty\ncaused the bottle to be overturned.\n\n\"Now look what you've done,\" said Flip. \"We've got only enough left for\nthirty-nine days.\"\n\n\"Sho shorry,\" said Charlie.\n\nFlip felt in his shirt pocket for a cigarette and found the ill-starred\nmap which had brought him here. The lines were blurred with sweat but\nhe could still make out the circle designating the mainland port, the\ncrow's feet designating the swamp, the large X in the upper left where\nthe xanite was. He didn't need the map any more; for the location was\nstark in his mind. In fact he wished he could forget it.\n\n\"Ah, well,\" he said. He opened the tube-light, held the map over the\nhissing jet. It turned brown, then black and he crumbled the ashes in\nhis fingers. \"I sometimes wonder what'll happen to me next....\"\n\nHe heard something above the wind at the door; probably a stray veedle,\none of the mud-mice which infested the swamp. Then he noticed Charlie's\neyes. They were very big and slowly his mouth fell open. He's gone\n_loku_ loco, thought Flip. Charlie was staring past him, over his\nshoulder. Flip whirled around.\n\nA woman stood in the door.\n\nFlip dropped his glass. Behind the woman stood three men. The woman\nsaid something in Venusian. Flip couldn't understand and there was a\ndumb pause as he stared with eyes that grew wider. The woman wore\nhip-high swamp boots, two guns on her belt, a filmy shirt open at the\nthroat. Her hair, uncovered and flowing, was golden, vaporous as the\nmist. Flip heard Charlie replying in the native language. The woman\nstepped into the room. Eyes flicking into every corner, the three men\nfollowed her. In the hand of each was an .03 pistol.\n\nShe halted before them and Flip rose from his chair like a ghost.\nCharlie sat very still. His face was pale, eyes narrow.\n\n\"Sit down.\" It was a command and Flip sank back down helplessly. In his\namazement he'd probably have done anything she said. She spoke English,\nin the liquid tones of a native. And she was Venusian, in all its\nancient connotation. Her eyes met Flip's evenly, calmly. Her eyes were\nemerald green.\n\n\"You are Flip Miller,\" she said. \"You have a map. Give it to me.\" She\nheld out her hand, as if refusal to her easy words was unthinkable.\nFlip found his voice.\n\n\"Who--?\" he began. Her eyes were cold, commanding; his ego rebelled and\nhe stood up quickly. With a swift hand, one of the men pushed him back\ndown. Flip came up again with fists balled. A pistol was jabbed in his\nside.\n\n\"Jupiter's jumpers!\" cried Flip. \"What is this?\"\n\n\"Captain Vixen....\" breathed Charlie.\n\n\n\nThe .03 gun was persuasive and Flip sat down. The man was huge,\nugly with a welted blue scar across his cheek. He stepped back and\nstood with feet wide apart, the gun pointed at Flip's chest. Another\nstationed himself at the door, the other stood behind Charlie. The\nwoman leaned against the table, crossed her legs.\n\n\"The map?\" she said and produced a cigarette. Bravado was the word for\nFlip, naturally or _\u00c3\u00a0 la loku_, and forgetting his anger he struck a\nmatch for her. She ignored him, lit the cigarette herself. Without\nchanging his expression, Flip thumped the burning match toward the man\nwith the gun.\n\n\"So you're Captain Vixen,\" he said, meeting her gaze. \"Perhaps I should\nask for your autograph.\"\n\n\"I should brand it on your mouth, Earthman. But the map, please?\"\n\nShe wasn't beautiful, thought Flip; her eyes were too far apart,\nher lips too large--sensual. And her green eyes, her eyebrows long\nand slanting, her firm lithe sleekness--they were more feline than\nfeminine. Which was dangerously feminine, thought Flip, and perhaps she\nwas beautiful.\n\n\"Captain Vixen, the Legend does you an injustice,\" he observed. \"The\ncomplexion! Like swamp lilies in the mist....\" Then he laughed, for\nlovely women weren't danger to Flip Miller. Quite on the contrary. \"Now\nwhat's all this about a map? My xanite mine?\"\n\n\"Fool, did you think your arrival on Venus was not made known to\nme--and your purpose here?\"\n\n\"You followed me to get that map!\" Flip threw back his head with mirth.\nCharlie made shushing noises. But it was too funny, Flip thought.\nDidn't she know the mine was worthless? She must! But she had come out\nhere after him in person. Perhaps she didn't know the bottom had fallen\nout of the xanite market.\n\nThe woman motioned to the man with the scar. \"Search him,\" she said,\nsmoke curling from her lips. The fellow came forward, reached out a\nhairy hand. Flip slapped it aside, annoyed.\n\n\"Oh, drop the mask, Viki, and let's be friends,\" he said. \"And I don't\nlike the company you keep.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord!\" groaned Charlie. The man looked at the woman, waited for\norders.\n\n\"I said search him,\" she repeated.\n\nThe man holstered his gun, snatched at Flip's collar. The shirt ripped\nand Flip's fist came up as he rose. _Spat!_ The man staggered backward,\nhit the wall and slid to the floor. In the same second Flip hurled his\nchair at the man in the doorway. The woman was between him and the\nother fellow's gun, which probably saved him. He saw Charlie get to his\nfeet as he whirled upon the woman--to find her pistol only inches from\nhis belly.\n\nCharlie turned upon the man behind him and was struck in the face by a\ngun barrel. He fell across a pile of fur, was struggling up when the\nheavy man deliberately placed a foot upon his wrist. Flip heard the\nbone snap.\n\nHe ground his teeth in rage, started to lunge at the man and felt the\nwoman's gun press into his ribs. She had not moved from the table and\nher face was calm as ever. She had merely changed the cigarette to her\nleft hand.\n\nFingering their bruises, the men Flip had dealt with came up. The other\nhad his gun leveled on Charlie. Flip saw the little trapper get slowly\nto his feet, holding his limp arm. His face was very white. It was then\nthat Flip became quite sober to the situation. Suddenly he forgot this\nwoman's beauty, and what had been admiration turned to burning hate.\n\nHe told her so.\n\n\"For the last time,\" she said, \"I'm asking for that map.\" Her eyes were\ngreen ice and her hand did not waver on the gun.\n\n\"I burned the map.\"\n\n\"Then you will tell me the location.\"\n\n\"I will tell you nothing.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we can change your mind,\" she said. \"Bring a rope, Thorg.\"\n\n\n\nAfter being thoroughly searched, they were pushed through the door.\nCharlie didn't say anything and Flip knew his wrist must be agony.\n\nTwilight had come, the long twilight of Venus which precedes the longer\nnight, and the mist was wet with drizzling rain. Visibility was poor;\nFlip could see only a few yards ahead. The sun, never seen on this dank\nplanet, was now below the horizon leaving a dull gray afterglow--like\nfalse dawn on Earth. He did not know where they were going nor what\nmad torture the woman had conceived. He knew only that hate flamed in\nhis chest and her white throat in his hands would be a great pleasure.\nNever before had Flip desired to harm a woman. But never before had he\nseen one like this.\n\nThey passed a trim strato-plane, vague in the fog, and Flip discovered\nhow the pirates managed to land so noiselessly. On their craft's\npower jets were the slim serpentine coils of Doxim silencers, exhaust\nmufflers banned for years by Interstellar Law. If only a veedle would\ncrawl in one of those tubes, he thought; it might blow up the ship.\n\nSlashing through the rain at Charlie's side, the threatening guns\nclose behind, Flip was jerked from his heated musings by an .03 shot.\nHe whirled around, saw smoke curling from the pistol in the woman's\nhand. A dead veedle, an exceptionally small mud-mouse, lay at her feet.\nLordy, thought Flip as he was pushed on; the woman was heartless,\nmercilessly cruel for the sport of it....\n\nThe edge of the little island halted them. Here the rock fell away for\nseveral feet to the sickening ooze. Covering half of Venus, it was the\nBlack Swamp which stretched off in the dismal fog.\n\n\"Tie a rope around his neck and throw him over,\" came the woman's\nimpassive voice. \"He will become quite loquacious before he sinks....\"\n\nSo this was it. Flip looked at Charlie and Charlie looked at the swamp.\nFlip followed his gaze and the dark viscous mire rippled in a passing\nbreeze, hissed against the rock and sucked hungrily like a live thing\nwaiting to feed. The swamps were bottomless.\n\nThe man Thorg, the one who had broken Charlie's wrist, threw a loop\nover Flip's head, pulled it tight about his neck.\n\nFlip fingered the rope and stared at the woman. Would she really do\nthis? And would he talk? No! Damned if he would! He'd sink first. But\nthe mine was worthless. Why not tell her where it was? But he had no\nreason to expect a lesser fate if he did. Besides it was a matter of\nhonor now--and he knew one way to enhance that honor.\n\n\"Hold the rope when you shove him in,\" said the woman, her eyes mere\nslits against the mist. \"Let him sink slowly.\" The other two men had\ntheir guns trained upon Flip. He met Thorg's beady eyes.\n\n\"Son of a veedle!\" Flip said in his face. Suddenly he swooped down and\nupward with one long arm. The man was shoved forward, to the brink of\nthe rock. He tottered there a long second, waving his arms frantically.\nFlip sprang toward the woman. Flame burst around him, he wasn't hit.\nHe heard Thorg scream. He crashed into the woman as he heard a splash,\nmore screams. Then there was silence and he was struggling on the\nwet-rock, the woman fighting like a tiger.\n\nFlip found her gun hand, wrenched the weapon from her. He got to his\nknees. The two men stood before him, one holding his gun on Charlie.\nThey couldn't fire at Flip for fear of hitting the woman. Flip started\nto blast them, then turned the pistol upon their Captain Vixen beside\nhim.\n\n\"Drop your guns or I'll kill her,\" he said. He leveled his pistol, got\nto his feet and backed away from the group. \"Take their guns, Charlie,\"\nhe grinned. \"We're not licked yet.\"\n\n\"No?\" said the woman.\n\nHis eyes flicked to her. She had a pistol in her hand. Flip had his\nsights dead upon her. Damn, he thought; he'd forgotten she carried two\nguns. They stared at each other--stalemated. The very wind was still.\n\n\"I've never killed a woman--\" Flip said.\n\n\"I've never killed a man,\" she said quietly, \"before.\" For the first\ntime she smiled. Flip's gun was suddenly jerked away, fire streaked\ntoward him, he heard the crash.\n\nShe had shot the gun from his hand.\n\n\n\nHe stood there, helpless and dumb. Captain Vixen lit a cigarette, her\ngun still ready. She looked at him a long moment.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, green eyes never leaving his, \"what are we waiting\nfor?\" She motioned to the man with the scar. \"Take the end of the rope,\nVoss. Our Earthian friend hasn't tasted the mud yet, you know.\"\n\nCharlie hadn't said anything. A gun at his back, his white mustache\nruffled by the wind, he stood silently watching Flip, holding his\nbroken arm. The choice was up to Flip.\n\n\"Look at the mud, Flip Miller,\" said the woman. \"There is not even a\nripple where Thorg went down. He went quickly. You shall dip slowly,\nthat the conceit of your tongue and the rashness of your mind may be\nreflected upon with regret.\" Flip glanced over the rock's edge. There\nwas only the quiet, waiting mire; no trace of Thorg's body.\n\n\"Vixen--\" he began. He never finished for Voss pushed him over with\nboth hands.\n\nThe black surface of the mud rushed up at him. Arms flailing off\nbalance, he hit on his side with a heavy splash. He heard Charlie's\nyell from above. He raised his head from the mud, tried to brush the\nstuff from his eyes. A soft and clinging pressure was warm against his\nlegs, his waist. Through the mud in his eyes, he saw the dark flat\nplain of the swamp stretching away into the mist. Turning, he saw the\nperpendicular rock wall of the island rising above him. The hot ooze\ncrawled up to his chest and in his nostrils was the fetid smell of the\nswamp, dank with the warm breath of ancient decay.\n\nThe mud crawled higher. He struck out with his hands against it,\nstruggled to pull himself upward but a grim suction tugged at his feet\nand legs, slowly drew his body downward. Then his wrists were caught in\nthe irresistible pull. He couldn't move his arms. Looking down, he saw\nthe black mire high on his chest. As he watched, fascinated, the mire\nrose higher. It was at his shoulders.\n\nKeen and swift, panic struck like a knife in his belly and his arms\nstrained, every muscle in his body trembled with mad flight. But he\ncouldn't move and the mud climbed to his throat. This is _it_, he\nthought, and pictures paraded through his mind, irrelevant flashes. He\nsaw faces, dim in the mist above him, blurred with water and the mud\nin his eyes. He shook his head violently, the faces cleared. There was\nchoking pain in his throat. The faces were of three men, and a woman.\n\nIt was Vixen, looking down from the rock above. His head was strained\nback and upward against the rope, tight on his throat. He had stopped\nsinking.\n\n\"Have you found your tongue?\" It was the woman's voice. \"Where is the\nmine? Speak! Tell me or you sink!\"\n\nFlip stared at her and could say nothing. He was smothered with the\nnoose on his neck. His eyes burned with the pain, with red hatred of\nthe woman.\n\n\"Let him down slowly.\" Her voice again. Flip stared up at her with mute\npassion.\n\nThe mud caressed his chin, repulsive and warm. Slowly, he felt it creep\nhigher, moist against the back of his head.\n\n\"Speak, fool! Where is the mine?\"\n\nHe stared up at her with bulging eyes, couldn't speak. Her words were\nmeaningless. He felt only the pain in his throat, the pressure of the\nmire against his body. He knew only that he hated the voice that spoke\nand that his body was weak with that hatred. The mud crawled into his\nears and the voice stopped. The mud rose to his lips. He could taste\nthe thick salty warmth of it. He closed his mouth tightly but the taste\nremained. The mud bubbled at his nostrils. He couldn't breathe. He saw\nthe vast flat plain of black become level with his eyes.\n\nThe mud covered his eyes.\n\n\n\nThe air was good and he gulped at it. He was lying on the rock. He felt\nhis throat, wiped his face and saw somebody standing over him in the\nrain. The man had a scar across his cheek.\n\n\"Try the other one.\" It was the woman's voice. \"Perhaps the muddy\nEarthian will talk to save his friend if not himself.\"\n\nFlip sat up and stared at them, gathering his wits. Charlie had a rope\nabout his neck. The man Voss held a pistol at his back. Charlie grinned\nat him.\n\n\"Proud of you, boy,\" he said. His right arm dangled at his side.\nFailing the first time, Flip's scene was to be repeated with a new\nperformer.\n\n\"No,\" said Flip. \"No! Charlie doesn't know where the mine is--he had\nnothing to do with this.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" said the woman. \"Perhaps seeing him in the mud will affect\nyour obstinacy.\"\n\n\"That mine's worthless,\" Flip said. \"It's no good any more. Since\nI.M.C.--\"\n\n\"I know,\" she replied.\n\n\"Hush, Flip,\" said Charlie. \"There's more going on than we know about.\nDon't tell her. I'm an old man and--\"\n\n\"Throw him in,\" said the woman impatiently.\n\nFlip got to his feet, ignoring the gun in his face. Voss picked up the\nend of the rope around Charlie's neck.\n\n\"Stop,\" said Flip. \"I'll tell you.\" He couldn't let Charlie go through\nwith this. It wasn't his problem and he had a broken wrist already.\n\n\"Be quiet,\" said Charlie. \"I don't--\"\n\n\"Talk,\" the woman told Flip. The mine must mean a lot to her, Flip\nthought. Why? He was positive about the present market price. Could the\nradio report have been wrong? No. Not in a quotation affecting five\nplanets.\n\n\"What do you want with that mine?\" Flip stalled. \"You know the market\nprice.\"\n\n\"Your questions are unhealthy, Earthman. Tell me the mine's location or\nyour friend goes in the swamp--without a rope.\"\n\nFlip told her. He didn't lie. He gave the exact Venusio-magnetic\ndirection he'd taken to find it. But he was sure of one thing--that\nthere was more here than he knew. The radio report must have been\nwrong....\n\n\"You shouldn't of told her, Flip,\" said Charlie.\n\n\"Your life will be short if he lied,\" said the woman. She glanced up at\nthe fog. It was a shade darker than when they had come and the rain was\nstronger. The mist was thickening and it was much cooler, Flip noticed.\n\n\"Come,\" said the woman, \"we must prove his words while there is light.\"\nShe turned, walked up the rock toward the ship. \"Tie them in the\ncabin,\" she ordered over her shoulder. \"If he lied, we shall return.\nIf he spoke truth--they have only to free themselves before they\nstarve....\"\n\n\n\nWhen the men left, Flip immediately tried the rope. Pulling with all\nhis strength, he couldn't slacken it and, with the pain in his arm,\nthere was little Charlie could do.\n\n\"Lordy!!\" said Flip. \"What now?\"\n\n\"We're lucky to be alive,\" said Charlie. \"Captain Vixen must have taken\na fancy to you.\"\n\nFlip strained at his ropes with the thought of her. Venusian women were\nthe beauties of the Universe and this woman had surpassed them all, but\nin her dull beauty, thought Flip, there was nothing feminine. She had\nno heart. She had but one emotion--the pursuit of her goal.\n\n\"It gets pretty chilly during the nights,\" said Charlie happily. \"We'll\nget pneumonia before we starve.\"\n\nFlip looked helplessly about the room. They were bound to their chairs\nand the ropes looped through holes in the wall. There was no way Flip\ncould get to Charlie and perhaps untie him. The house was of metal and\nthrough the rusty walls and the open door came the increasing chill of\nnight. Captain Vixen's men had made them \"comfortable,\" left them to\nthe whistling wind.\n\nThere was a draft on Flip's neck and he turned to see the rust had\neaten away a small crack behind him. Just another thing, he thought.\nHe was still caked with mud. Then he almost turned over his chair with\nexcitement. He craned his neck, saw where the rope binding him was\nlooped through the wall. They were two small holes, rusty as the rest.\n\n\"Charlie,\" he said hoarsely, \"these dumb Venusians! They've tied us to\na _knife blade_!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The holes they put the rope through! Look at the edges!\" He began\nsee-sawing back and forth with his chair. The rope rubbed against the\nrusty edges as he did so. \"Maybe I can make it in time. It's been only\na few minutes and they've got to warm up the ship.\"\n\n\"You mean you're going to face them again. Saints o' Saturn! Leave well\nenough alone, boy!\"\n\nFlip kept at his work. If he could get this part of the rope cut the\nrest would be simple. \"And let 'em get that mine? Hell no! There's\nsomething about that xanite I don't understand and I'm going to find\nout what. I'd like a nice long chat with Miss Vixen too.\"\n\nCharlie gave up trying to dissuade him and Flip kept sawing. With the\nmufflers, he couldn't hear the ship leave but he was sure they hadn't\ngone yet. Those high-power planes took a lot of warming up, especially\nwith Moxims. What to do when he got there? Flip Miller's mind never\nstrayed far from the present.\n\nThe rope broke. It was a matter of minutes before he was free.\n\n\"Try the same thing, Charlie,\" Flip said at the door. \"You wouldn't be\nmuch good out there with a busted wrist and I'll be back before long.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Charlie doubtfully as Flip streaked out into the rain.\n\n\n\nThe ship loomed before him in the mist and Flip halted, some degree of\nsanity entering the elation of his escape. He couldn't see through the\nfogged windows, but there were three skillful guns inside and he was\nunarmed. They had taken all the guns from the shack when they left.\nBesides, the ship's door was closed and a strato-plane's hull is solid\nmetal. Though he considered it, he couldn't just go up and knock.\n\nThe rise-rockets were idling. A pink glow appeared at each blast but\nthere was only a soft hissing with the mufflers. The power jets hadn't\nstarted; they were geared with a synchronized heat progression which\nignited them only when the proper temperature was reached.\n\nA veedle scampered across Flip's foot and he jumped. If a veedle\ncrawled into one of those muffler tubes it would explode, he remembered\nthinking when he first saw the ship. Flip snapped his fingers. If a\nveedle could cause it, why not he? With mud! He could fill a power\njet and when the ignition started, it would burst like a clogged gun\nbarrel. They couldn't leave. Perfect!\n\nKeeping well below the windows, he approached the ship. The power jets,\nas usual, were outside and forward of the glowing rise-rockets so he\ncould work in safety. That is, unless the jets started while he was\nnear them. But he would never know it if they did.\n\nFlip scooped up a handful of mud, stuffed it into the five-inch\nopening. It was like pouring water in a veedle hole but he kept at\nit, and heat from the smaller tubes blistering his hands. He could\nhear people moving about inside the plane. Finally he packed one more\nhandful to make sure, grinning to himself.\n\nThe door in the side of the ship suddenly opened.\n\nFlip dropped down beside the hull. It was the big fellow with the\nscarred cheek. He jumped down, walked toward the rear of the ship where\nFlip was. Making a take-off inspection, Flip decided. What should he\ndo? He could make a break across the rocks, lose himself in the mist.\nNo--they'd track him down, get Charlie again too. Well, there was one\nthing to do then.\n\nThe man was silhouetted against the open door as he walked forward. In\nthe heavy mist, he couldn't see Flip yet. Crouched on hands and toes,\nFlip sank lower. The muscles in his knees tensed. The man came on. Flip\nshot toward him, hands outstretched.\n\nHis fingers found the thick throat, squeezed with all their might as\nthe force of his spring carried them both to the ground. Flip landed on\ntop, kept his hold on the man's neck. The fellow brought up his hands,\nplucked frantically at Flip's wrists but he made only soft gurgling\nsounds and soon his hands fell away. Flip turned him loose. He wasn't\ndead; a little out of breath. Flip took his pistol from its holster.\nTo keep him quiet a while longer, he slugged a finishing touch on his\nchin.\n\nWith a grin at this aesthetic work, he got to his feet. He had a gun\nnow. But it was still two against one--he'd learned to count the\nwoman--and they were inside. It would be risky entering the ship.\nBetter wait till somebody else came out. They'd be out looking for this\nfellow soon enough. The door was still open.\n\nFlip dragged the unconscious man under the rounded hull. Eyes on the\ndoor, he crouched down beside him to wait.\n\nSuddenly he remembered the mud he'd stuffed in the power jet. Wow! If\nthat thing exploded with him near it--! He leaped up, stuck the gun\nin his belt. He reached down to drag the man away too. As he turned,\nsomething jabbed hard in his side.\n\n\"So you haven't had enough, Earthman?\" It was the other fellow, Voss.\nHe must have come out the other side, circled around the back.\n\nThe rockets were glowing cherry red now. The power jets would ignite\nany moment.\n\n\n\n\"Get away!\" cried Flip. \"I clogged a tube! It'll explode--\"\n\n\"No more of your tricks, Earthman,\" said Voss. He yanked Flip's gun\nfrom his belt, stuck both of them in Flip's belly.\n\n\"You fool, we'll be blown to bits.\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" said Voss, eyeing his comrade lying beside the ship. He\npoked him with the toe of his boot. The man groaned, moved slightly.\n\nFlip saw bubbles ooze from the jet he'd stopped up. It was a matter of\nseconds.\n\nIgnoring the gun, Flip hit Voss in the face. The man staggered back.\nFlip whirled to run. As he turned, the mist exploded red. Something\ncrashed into him. An ear-splitting roar.\n\nHis head hit the rock and he was stunned for a moment. Something large\nand heavy lay across him. It was quiet in the mist and the rain was\ncool. It was a man's body across him. Something hot and sticky seeped\nthrough his clothes.\n\nFlip shoved the man aside, sat up. He looked at the man's face. It was\nVoss. The back of his head was gone. His shoulders were a crimson mass\nand his back and legs were shredded.\n\nFlip got to his feet. He was covered with blood too but could find only\nslight cuts. Voss had received the full force of the explosion and his\nbody had protected him.\n\n\"Are all Earthians so lucky?\" said a voice.\n\nFlip looked up. The woman, Captain Vixen, was standing before him in\nthe rain. One hand was on her hip. The other held a pistol.\n\nFlip stared at her a long time and neither spoke.\n\n\"Lady,\" he said finally, \"must this game go on forever?\"\n\n\"Not for you,\" she replied.\n\n\n\n\"Earthman,\" said the woman, \"in the hills, I am Queen. On the mainland,\nI am Terror. In the swamps, I am Death. Whatever defies me on this--my\nplanet--dies. It needs be so, for the resources of Venus have been\nplunder to the Universe. Imperialism ruled until my father, king before\nme, died fighting it. You, Earthman, are a symbol of those that killed\nhim, those that drove my people to poverty--until I came. I am a symbol\nof the Venus that _was_--and, as I live, shall be again. You understand\nnow why you die....\"\n\nFlip looked at the woman and the rain molded her hair into golden\nringlets, the wind shaped her body in the sheer lines of an ancient\ngoddess. The mist softened the chill beauty of her face and her green\neyes were misty in the deepening twilight.\n\nThe wind was keen and Flip shivered.\n\n\"You are the coldest woman I ever knew,\" he said.\n\n\"And you are the coolest man.\"\n\n\"Since I am to die,\" said Flip, \"you may tell me why you wanted that\nworthless mine.\"\n\n\"The xanite is worthless--\" She paused. \"The asphalt mixed with it is\npitchblende. It was a secret of my father's that the lost Swamp Mine\nholds enough _radium_ to buy the Universe--to return Venus to her\nrightful place again.\"\n\nShe raised the pistol, took aim at his chest. Her hand was without a\ntremor.\n\n\"At the swamps,\" said Flip, \"you said you'd never killed a man.\"\n\n\"I spoke truth. Now I am alone--I must.\"\n\nFlip heard a splash. A veedle scurried across the woman's boots. She\nscreamed. The mud-mouse streaked off into the mist. The woman's arms\ndropped to her sides. Her eyes were wide. For a fleeting second, the\nepitome of womankind was on her face. And the warmth of irrational\nhelplessness. Then quickly it was gone, the mask returned. She jerked\nup her gun and fired. The shot went over Flip's head as he dived. His\nlunge knocked her down. He snatched the pistol from her hand, hurled it\ninto the mist.\n\nPinning her arms to the ground, Flip sat upon her and laughed.\n\n\"You're a woman,\" he gritted, \"you're a woman--afraid of a mouse!\" She\nstruggled violently to free herself. \"You're a woman, forced into a\ndeadly legend--a persecution complex. You're beautiful....\"\n\nHe bent, kissed her full upon the lips.\n\nShe freed one arm, slapped him across the face. He didn't feel it.\nThere were tears in her emerald green eyes. Flip threw back his head,\nroared his laughter to the wind.\n\nHe'd forgotten Captain Vixen carried two guns.",
