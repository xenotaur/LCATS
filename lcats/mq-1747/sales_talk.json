    "body": "Looking out the window, I saw them crossing the court toward the\nbuilding--two of them. One, the taller with yellow hair, was carrying a\nflat, expensive briefcase, and the other, of course, was carrying the\nlarge square box that contained the Sim.\n\nThe buzzer sounded, announcing them at the door, and I opened it with\nmixed feelings. I wasn't sure myself how I would act and--well, you\nhear so many stories about EL, and this was really my first contact\nwith them.\n\nThey were standing out in front, looking just like a couple of\ndoor-to-door salesmen. And that's just what they were, even if they\nwere called Electro Medical Consultants. Just a fancy name for salesmen.\n\nThey were very neat in appearance, just as good salesmen should be.\nTheir hats looked new and so did their shoes.\n\n\"Ah, Mr. Gaines,\" said the yellow-haired one, sticking out his neatly\nmanicured but definitely masculine hand, \"I'm very happy to meet you,\nsir.\" His grin could only be described as sincerely boyish.\n\n\"Come in,\" I said, feeling like smiling back, so effectively pleasant\nwere their grins. \"Come in and sit down, won't you?\"\n\nSo they came in, doffing their hats, and sat down in two chairs that I\nordinarily didn't use. They seemed to know instinctively which was _my_\nfavorite chair. Oh, they were smooth!\n\n\"Now, Mr. Gaines,\" said the light-haired man, \"perhaps I should start\noff with a little introduction all around and a short explanation of\nwhat Electronic Living can mean to you.\"\n\nNo one had mentioned EL up to that point, yet they knew without a doubt\nthat I had correctly identified them. Talk about confidence--it was\nlike a physical force in the room.\n\n\"I'm Jake Long and this is Arnie Blik,\" said the light-haired one,\nrising and gripping my hand with a warm, dry, just right handshake.\n\n\"Pleased to meet you,\" said Blik, gripping my hand in turn with an\nidentical warm, dry, just right handshake.\n\n\"I'm going to ask you for a bit of your time,\" said Long, \"and\nI certainly hope you can grant us a few minutes without too much\ninconvenience.\"\n\n\n\nI murmured something about having plenty of time. That was a laugh, and\nhe and I both knew it. I had so little to do, I almost welcomed them\njust for sheer entertainment value.\n\n\"Well, that's fine,\" said Long, \"but rest assured we aren't going to\ntry to waste any of your time. We intend to make it short and sweet, as\nthey say.\" He did such a good job of keeping up the fiction of me being\na busy man that I almost believed it myself.\n\n\"You probably know more about Electronic Living than I do,\" he said,\nand I felt for an instant that I did, \"but we'll go over it anyway just\nso you understand me a little better. You'll remember back in 1958-1959\nthere was a lot of work done--or I should say a beginning made--in\ndeveloping an electronic eye for people who had lost their eyesight.\nThis was a start of Electronic Living in its crudest form. These early\npioneers, using what little knowledge was available of the brain\nthen, were actually able to insert a probe in the brain and enable\nthe blind person to 'see' light. At first it was just the difference\nbetween light and dark, but after a while they did develop a kind of\nvision--and then finally, after much work, the system grew into actual\nelectronic vision.\n\n\"This was, as I said, the start of Electronic Living because it\nadvanced the basic premise that the brain can utilize outside\nelectrical impulses for its own purposes. And of course it wasn't long\nbefore some experimenters had rigged up a human television receiver.\nWhat they did was set up a series of brain probes which were directly\nconnected to a small television receiving apparatus, and the subject\ncould then 'see' the broadcast image without the use of his eyes.\n\n\"Since this rough beginning, we at EL have done a lot of work, and we\nare now able to reproduce every sort of physical sensation known to man\nthrough electronic brain connections.\n\n\"And recently, as a further refinement, we have been able to capture\ninternal brain voltages and use them to reproduce thoughtlike\nsensations. Unfortunately, these are still in the realm of strong\nemotions and not true thoughts, but they are extremely effective.\n\n\"Now, it is this combination of physical sensation voltages and\ninternal brain voltages, when fed into your brain from a simple tape\nlike this, that produces what we call Electronic Living.\"\n\nWith that he pulled a piece of tape out of his pocket as if producing\nan elephant from a thimble.\n\n\n\nArnie Blik hadn't said a word up to this point. He had hung on every\nword his partner uttered as though it were all new to him. Now he took\nup the song.\n\n\"May I ask if you've ever experienced Electric Living?\" he asked.\n\n\"No,\" I said. I really had once or twice, but I figured it was none of\nhis business.\n\n\"Ah. Well, if you have no objection, I'd like to use this Simulator\nhere for a few minutes and give you a bare idea of what's going on in\nElectronic Living today.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said. \"Go right ahead.\"\n\nBlik opened up the Sim and fished out a hat that was shaped much like a\nmedieval knight's helmet, except that it had a couple of big fat wires\nconnected to it at the back.\n\n\"Just a moment while I tune it in,\" Blik said, lowering the helmet part\nway over his head. He closed his eyes and began fiddling with a series\nof small knots and buttons which were mounted inside the case. Finally\nhe took it off his head and approached me, carrying this ridiculous\nhelmet like it was a crown on a velvet pillow.\n\n\"You will be experiencing a basketball player,\" he said, and plopped it\ndown over my head.\n\nWhen the helmet came down, there was a momentary blank period,\nand then suddenly I was a basketball player who was playing a fast\nprofessional game. I was good, or should say he was? He felt exultation\nbecause his team was ahead and he'd put them there with a difficult\nshot. I could feel the pounding of his heart and the strain of his\nchest as he gulped in huge quantities of air. His eyes ranged around\nthe court, following his teammates and opponents.\n\nIt was something, all right, but not everything, because on top of the\nsensations and emotions of the basketball player, I was getting another\nseries of feelings and emotion which were my own.\n\nSuperimposed on the other players on the court was the image of my\nown living room with the two men watching me. Over the smell of sweat\nof the basketball players came the odor of my apartment. Above the\nsensation of running, jumping and colliding with other players was the\nsensation of sitting in my favorite chair with a weight on my head.\n\nIn short, I was two people at one time.\n\nEven the emotions of the basketball player--joy at making a basket,\na flare of rage at a rough opponent, and the surge of hope that a\nteammate would come through--were clouded over with my own emotions of\nnot completely accepting as right the whole concept of EL, coupled\nwith the feeling that I didn't want to show any reaction in front of\nthe EL men.\n\nAfter a short time, Blik removed the Sim, and the basketball player's\nLife Experience faded away. The two EL men looked at me expectantly.\n\n\"Hmmm,\" I said, forcing myself to appear neutral. They did not seem to\nbe disappointed by my reaction or lack of it.\n\n\n\n\"Quite an experience, wasn't it?\" said Blik, putting the Sim down on\nthe floor. \"Of course you realize that you don't get the full effect\nbecause you actually have two primary sets of electric images going\ninto the brain. We never have been able to overcome the subject's own\nreal physical and mental sensation with a device that works outside the\nskull.\"\n\n\"But I'm sure Mr. Gaines gets the idea,\" said Long.\n\n\"I'm sure I do,\" I said. The damn thing was plenty intriguing, but\nsomehow, despite all its good points, I wasn't really sold on it.\n\n\"Perhaps you'd be interested in the kind of thing we have programmed\nfor our EL subscribers,\" said Long with a kindly smile. \"If you are\nsomeone who likes active sports, we can give you an evening of that\nkind of thing. We don't program sports in the daytime or early evening\nbecause it interferes with the regular sports consumers, but it's\nnice to have later on in the evening if you like it.\"\n\nI nodded in what I hoped was a cold manner.\n\n\"Perhaps you'd like the milieu built up around a hard-working farmer\nor laborer for a daytime program. A certain amount of physical labor\nwhich is coupled with a strong emotion of accomplishment and pride. An\nexcellent milieu and one of our most popular currently.\"\n\n\"Very interesting,\" I said noncommitally, intrigued in spite of myself.\n\nThen it was Blik's turn. \"If you are interested in the social type of\nthing, we have several new milieus that fit right in with this sort\nof thing. I can recall one of a formal dinner party which has strong\nemotional connotations of well-being and a sense of--grandeur--yes,\ngrandeur in the old meaning of the word. And in this same milieu\nit is possible to get the bon-vivant type of thing. You know, the\nraconteur who is a real spellbinder. That has a strong emotion of\nego-fulfillment.\"\n\n\"Very interesting,\" I said again, \"but it doesn't quite fill the bill\nas far as I'm--\"\n\n\"Arnie, we've been overlooking the obvious,\" said Long. \"Mr. Gaines\nis looking more for the intellectual type of Life Experience. Now,\nI recall one of a sculptor which has a fine feel to it. Extremely\nintellectual and yet artistically creative, if you know what I mean.\nAnd then there's an extremely thrilling milieu dealing with a symphony\nconductor in which there is an absolute physical thrill that is\naudio-inspired. Just the thing for anyone who is an audiophile, I'd\nsay.\"\n\nI had to admit that it was beginning to sound more appealing all the\ntime and I found myself wondering just which Life Experience one would\npick first if he were to go EL.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Blik, with a manly grin, \"we have the thing we call\nour 'playboy milieu' which is strictly a sensual sort of a thing. It\noften appeals rather strongly to new subscribers, although I have to\nwarn you that it soon becomes an Experience which palls on you.\"\n\n\n\nHe almost had me with that one, because after all I have normal male\ncuriosity and all that, and naturally it's always these \"playboy\nmilieus\" that you hear the most about among people who are non-EL\nsubscribers. Yes, for a minute or two there, I was teetering on the\nbrink, but my better sense did ultimately win out and I could feel the\nemotion of resistance welling up inside me.\n\n\"Well, actually, gentlemen, it isn't a case of not finding the right\nmilieu, because I'm sure you have anything that I could ever want.\nIt's more on philosophical grounds that I find that I hesitate to go\nalong with Electronic Living,\" I said boldly. Just saying it gave me a\ntremendous lift.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Long, looking at the ceiling and making a tent of his\nfingers in front of his chest. \"I always enjoy talking with a man who\nhas a philosophical bent. In fact,\" he said, unfolding the tent and\nleaning close to me and lowering his voice a little, \"it's the one big\npleasure I get out of this job.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid that I have to agree with you there, Jack,\" said Blik,\ndigging his toe into the rug in a distinctly boyish manner.\n\n\n\n\"Why don't you sort of fill us in on your thinking, Mr. Gaines?\" urged\nLong.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, feeling warm under the collar and allowing my hand to\ntremble slightly with emotion as I got into what I now realized was the\nmeat of my resistance to EL. \"Well, let's take it from the word go. If\nI sign up with you now, I'll go down to the Electronic Living Center\ntomorrow or the next day and they'll take me into an operating room and\nput some tiny probes into my brain, and aside from a momentary twinge\nor two, I won't feel a thing. And then when it's over I'll walk out of\nthe room looking just the way I did before, except that I'll have a\nneat little connection mounted high on the left side of my head where\nit can be tastefully covered with hair when not in use.\n\n\"And I'll probably come back to this apartment to find the Electronic\nLiving Machine installed in that corner, tastefully decorated to look\nlike an old-fashioned antique bookcase, or a modern bar, or whatever\nI want it to look like. But whatever it looks like, there will be a\ncomfortable chair unobtrusively attached to the ELM and sooner or later\nI'll sit down in that chair and read over the list of Life Experiences\nand select one.\n\n\"Then I'll sink back in the chair and the little connection on my head\nwill fit neatly into another little connection on the chair, because my\nchair will fit only me, and it will fit me perfectly.\n\n\"And then, while I drift off to EL-land, the chair will unfold around\nme so that all sight and sound and almost all feeling will disappear\nand I'll be like a chrysalis in a cocoon.\n\n\"So for two or three or eight hours I'll stay inside the cocoon, living\nanother person's life. And while I'm in there, everyone will be sighing\na sigh of relief that here is another potential producer who has\nfinally given up the ghost and turned consumer.\n\n\"Then when the tape is through, the cocoon will open and I'll wake up\ntired or refreshed or satiated or somehow changed, and then I'll get\nout to the food center and dial a meal or call someone up, or go out\nand walk around or something.\"\n\n\n\nI was really getting wound up, but Long broke in on me. \"Tell me a\nlittle more,\" he said, \"about that one idea, will you? You know, the\nidea about how you will give up being a producer and will be all\nconsumer?\"\n\n\"I was just coming to that,\" I said hotly. \"Yes, they'll probably\nenroll my name on the EL subscribers roll with a big cheer, and all my\nnon-EL friends will hear about it and they'll raise their eyebrows, or\nmaybe they'll sign up too.\n\n\"But the point is this. Is it right for me, a big, strong, healthy\nhuman being with powers of perception and reasoning and a capability\nfor work and creativeness--is it right for me to substitute this dream\nworld of EL for actual real thinking, or doing, or creating? Do any of\nus have the right to subvert our normal impulses for creation and for\nliving in this way?\"\n\n\"A good question,\" said Long with a sigh. \"I'm afraid he's put it in\npretty unanswerable terms, all right. Except for one minor point, I\ncouldn't help but agree with everything he said, in spite of the fact\nthat I--well, I'm sold on EL, naturally.\"\n\nWe sat for a while just sort of gazing around at nothing.\n\nFinally Blik spoke up. \"What was that one point that you disagreed on\nJack?\" he asked his partner. \"I've been running Mr. Gaines' statement\nover in my mind and I can't seem to find the flaw you mentioned.\"\n\n\"Oh, it was nothing,\" said Long impatiently. \"Just a minor point.\"\n\n\"No, I mean it,\" said Blik. \"I'd really like to know.\"\n\n\"Not worth talking about. Let's pack up and not take any more of Mr.\nGaines' time.\"\n\n\"Come on, Jack, tell me what it was,\" said Blik, in a rather positive\nway, I thought.\n\n\"Really, Arnie,\" said Long, firing up a little, \"take it easy, will\nyou? We don't want to have to argue about some little point that\ndoesn't mean anything. Just forget it.\"\n\nHis attitude changed quickly from irritation to downright nastiness.\nApparently, as head of the sales team, he wasn't going to take anything\nfrom a subordinate. It kind of irritated me in turn, because he gave me\nthe impression that he felt as if he was too good to talk with us about\nit.\n\n\"All right, all right,\" said Blik, \"the hell with it. So it was a minor\npoint.\"\n\n\"Why not tell him?\" I asked Long, cutting in quickly as Blik made a\nmove to pack up the Sim.\n\n\n\nLong turned toward me with a supercilious look that put me in the same\ncategory as assistants who had the temerity to question the boss. Then\nin an instant the mask returned and he was just as polite and smooth\nas ever--but I'd seen the crack in the slickness before he changed. It\nreally got me where I live. That's one thing I can't stand--an assault\non the ego by a slick bum like that, who thinks he's so good.\n\n\"Oh, I don't see how it can be that small a point,\" I said. \"Especially\nif you thought of it.\" I said the last part as insultingly as I knew\nhow, and I saw the color rise in his face.\n\n\"Yes, speak up,\" said Blik, siding with me. \"He's got a right to know.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Long with some asperity that even the professional\nmask couldn't hide, \"but I warn you that it's strictly a minor point.\"\n\n\"So it's a minor,\" said Blik. \"Tell us.\"\n\n\"The point is,\" said Long, after a short pause to collect his\nthoughts, \"that EL fills a need for some people. You see, with the\nbig upsurge in automation years ago, it got harder and harder for a\nproduction-oriented economy to survive. Jobs got fewer and easier.\nPeople were thrown out of work. During the early years of automation,\nthere was a lot of population displacement because of a lack of jobs,\nand this made for a lot of economic juggling which really didn't help\nmatters.\n\n\"It wasn't until some ten years ago that people finally came to the\nconclusion that production was outstripping the need for labor and\nthat, in fact, production was beginning to become a burden on the\neconomy. And so they turned things around a bit. Instead of giving\nrewards and subsidies to the production end of the economy, they began\ngiving it to the consuming end. That was really the only way out of the\nhole.\n\n\"But it was soon found that people are not merely organisms geared\nto consume. At first it was grand and glorious, but after a bit the\nurge to create, to work, to think began to assert itself strongly, and\nthat's where EL came along. EL was developed to give unsatisfied people\nsatisfactions that they couldn't get anywhere else. They couldn't be\nallowed to produce because that was what was wrecking things. So they\nhad to be provided with a synthetic 'production-fulfillment.'\n\n\"Today these producer-minded people can get any sort of satisfaction\nthey need from EL, and it keeps them from wandering around trying to\nproduce something that would just be a hindrance. After all, what we\nneed is consumership, not production.\n\n\"But that's a relatively minor point, as I said earlier,\" Long\nconcluded looking at me with a superior air. \"It's such a minor point,\nit won't even bear discussion.\"\n\n\n\nHis manner, underneath the slick facade, implied that he wouldn't\ndeign to discuss it with two peasants like Blik and me under any\ncircumstances.\n\n\"Just a minute,\" I said. \"It's _not_ a minor point at all. It seems to\nme that you've hit the core of the problem.\"\n\n\"A minor point,\" insisted Long, his eyes blazing, although his face\nretained the mask of the smiling salesman.\n\n\"Perhaps I didn't make myself clear,\" I said. \"Have you ever stopped\nto think that if you take EL into the larger picture, it does serve a\npurpose, and perhaps we are all here for a different reason than I had\noriginally discussed? Maybe the thing to be is a super-consumer--maybe\ndefinitive consumership is the most vital thing in our life, not the\nproduction of things.\"\n\n\"Well, that's an idea, sure enough,\" said Blik suddenly. He had been\nsilent during the flare-up between Long and me. \"But I can't help\nbut think,\" he continued, \"that your original argument was a little\ntighter. The old virtues do have a place, don't they?\"\n\nYou see how slick, how well-trained, how cunning they were? When Blik\nopened his mouth, the bubble burst, and I knew that they had neatly\nswitched me around to where I was arguing against myself. Up until the\ninstant Blik started talking, I was actually selling myself on EL, and\nthe truth was that I had almost completed the job by that time. If he\nhad remained silent, I probably would have signed the contract--I think\nI would have fought to sign it.\n\nI felt an emotion of strength and power then. A top EL team had given\nme the works and I had seen through them. They still didn't know they\nhad lost, but they would--just as soon as I opened my mouth to speak.\nThe emotion of victory is sweeter than almost anything else, and all\nthe sweeter for having skirted defeat.\n\n\"You know, Arnie,\" I said, \"I agree with you. The old virtues are best.\nI think EL is a living hell.\"\n\nIt was a sight to see, believe me. Their slick, slick faces folded like\npaper houses in a hurricane. Blik's hands were shaking as he bent over\nand started packing up the Sim without another word. You have to be\ngood to know that fast that you have lost irrevocably.\n\nThey got up then and scooped their hats up from the floor and put them\non. The gracious, gentlemanly conduct was a thing of the past.\n\n\"Tell me,\" said Long, his hand on the door, the edge of the EL contract\npeeking untidily out of his expensive briefcase, \"where did we make our\nmistake?\"\n\nI laughed a good loud whoop. It felt good. \"It was when Arnie here\nswitched sides.\"\n\n\"Stupid fool,\" said Long, looking as though he wanted to slam the\nsquare box containing the Sim over Blik's head.\n\n\"Sorry, old man,\" Blik said, coloring a deep red. \"I'll try to make it\nup next time.\"\n\n\"Not with me, you won't,\" said Long. \"Technician!\"\n\nThey opened the door and went out. I jigged with glee as I looked out\nthe window and watched them cross the court. Long was walking along in\na high dudgeon, his briefcase swinging angrily with every step. Blik\nwas trotting along to one side and behind him, his shoulders slumped,\ndefeat written all over his form and walk.\n\n\n\nI looked around as the wall swung open and Rommy walked in with his\nhand outstretched.\n\n\"Congratulations!\" he said, beaming widely. \"It was perfect! My God,\nit's a delight for a director to work with a real group of competent\nactors. All three of you were perfect!\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" I said. \"I hope I was as good as you think when we play the\ntape back.\" I felt along the base of my skull where the transmitter\nhung encased in Natur-flesh and covered with fake hair. I could hardly\nbelieve it was there, it felt so natural.\n\nRommy looked out the window. Long and Blik were walking back through\nthe gate, talking and waving their arms the way people do when they're\nexcited about doing a good job.\n\n\"There's a pair of sweethearts,\" said Rommy. \"Real actors, those boys.\nI checked out the transmission right up to the last minute and they\nreally gave out--you couldn't find a quiver of disbelief or strain.\nThey _felt_ it.\"\n\n\"So did I,\" I said, sitting down and putting my feet up on a low table\non the set. \"Tell me, Rommy, what in hell is EL going to use these\ntapes for, anyway? It seems to me it would be sort of dangerous to put\nall this on tape.\"\n\n\"We couldn't tell you before because it might have spoiled your\nreactions, but we have a lot of EL subscribers who are down deep\nopposed to EL, and this tape will be sort of a catharsis for them.\nIt'll give them a real jolt.\"\n\n\"Oh, producer types who are struggling to become consumer types,\" I\nsaid. \"They'll experience the role I just got through playing, and it\nwill make them feel they didn't sign the contract, huh?\"\n\n\"There's more to it than that,\" said Rommy. \"There are some people who\njust like to experience an extremely strong sales-resistant emotion,\nmostly because they're pushovers. We wouldn't make a tape like this\njust for the anti-EL jerks. It's too expensive.\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" I said, \"what are you using Long and Blik for? I thought I\ndetected transmitters on them, too.\"\n\n\"Just the opposite from what you were doing. Some people like to\nexperience a setback or even a complete failure now and then. Sort of\nan opposite to the 'high' tapes. Lord knows we got hundreds of 'high'\ntapes, but not many low ones, so we're starting to build a library of\nthem now. A lot of subscribers are getting tired of winning all the\ntime and they'd like to experience a defeat or two once in a while just\nfor the contrast.\"\n\nLong and Blik came in the door without knocking.\n\nRommy was on his feet in an instant. \"Boys,\" he shouted, \"you were\ngreat! I checked the tapes and nobody could be lower than you guys\nwalking out across that court. It was sensational. Probably the best\nthing that's ever been done here at EL Studios!\"",
