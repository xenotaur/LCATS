A person what is as\nungrateful as you are can\u2019t partake of my cooking, neither will I\nbreak bread with such as he.\u201d\n\nI got my boots on, cooks me some bacon, and eats as far from that\nhombre as the room allows. A house divided can\u2019t ring with harmony,\nand love has put a breach as wide as the Grand Ca\u00f1on between me and\nMagpie. The little feller with the bow and arrer has rasped us raw.\n\nMagpie is the sheriff of our county, and I\u2019m his deputy. Me and that\nscantling-shaped hombre have been pardners ever since gold was\ndiscovered on bedrock, and this is the first rift in our lute. Of\ncourse there has been discords, but this is the first time that the\nstrings have all been busted!\n\nLove cometh at strange times. Me and Magpie have been over in the\nMedicine Hills, sort of looking for an alleged rustler, and are coming\nout, when we sees a nester\u2019s cabin with smoke coming out of the\nstovepipe. It\u2019s an old place, and ain\u2019t been occupied for some time,\nso we decides to investigate.\n\nWe\u2019re a heap hungry, and when we gets in shooting range we smells\nfried onions and coffee. There\u2019s an aroma of biscuits on the air, too,\nwhich don\u2019t hurt our noses none.\n\nWe pilgrims into the yard, and as we slips off our broncs the door\nopens, and we sees our heart\u2019s desire. She\u2019s a cute little filly.\nShe\u2019s slender, got a lot of eighteen-carat hair, and blue eyes as big\nas the end of a shotgun shell.\n\nShe\u2019s got a bowl full of dough in her hands, and she stares at us like\nwe\u2019re curiosities. Sudden-like she smiles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Sheriff Simpkins,\u201d states Magpie, removing his hat.\n\nShe gives a queer little squeak and drops her bowl on the ground.\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t done nothing!\u201d says she, sort of vacant-like.\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am, the queen can do no wrong,\u201d states Magpie. \u201cWe smells the\nodors of Araby, so our noses brings us hither.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnions,\u201d says she. \u201cDon\u2019t they smell.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfume of the gods,\u201d says I. \u201cI\u2019d wear one all the time if it wasn\u2019t\nfor the looks of the thing. I\u2019m your obedient servant, Ike Harper. You\nliving here alone?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she nods. \u201cA poor, defenseless woman. I hope there ain\u2019t no\nobjection to me using this cabin. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s yours,\u201d pronounces Magpie. \u201cIf anybody interferes with your\nhabitation you send for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd in case he\u2019s too busy I\u2019ll come,\u201d says I. \u201cHe\u2019s a busy man. I\u2019m\nsorry he was so quick to startle yuh, and make yuh bust your dough\nmug. He\u2019s abrupt that-away.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter,\u201d says she, \u201cWon\u2019t yuh come in?\u201d\n\nJust wouldn\u2019t we? Say! Them onions was the greatest and the biscuits\nwas the lightest yuh ever seen. Coffee? Nectar of the gods. There\nain\u2019t much furniture in the place, but what is in there looks\nhomelike. She\u2019s got a enlarged picture on the wall, the same of which\nseems familiar.\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d says Magpie, pointing at it, \u201cwould yuh mind telling me who\nthe distinguished-looking gent is?\u201d\n\n\u201cWas,\u201d says she, sad-like. \u201cHe\u2019s gone and\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMagpie,\u201d says I, \u201cdon\u2019t presume on short acquaintance to stir up sad\nmemories. There don\u2019t seem to be nothing sacred to him, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\nShe smiles at us, sweet-like, and nods;\n\n\u201cYes, he\u2019s gone, but his memory lingers. He was a good man.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou dang well know he was,\u201d agrees Magpie. \u201cIf he wasn\u2019t his picture\nwouldn\u2019t be on your walls. What did you say your name was?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say, Mister Simpkins: I am Lily Lester.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome pretty name. Call me Magpie\u2014pleased to meet yuh.\u201d\n\n\u201cI might not decipher the call if yuh said Mister Harper,\u201d says I.\n\u201cMaw used to call me Honey, but Ike suits me fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cHoney!\u201d snorts Magpie. \u201cNot comb-honey, Ike. You ain\u2019t used\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPersonalities are bad form, Magpie,\u201d I reminds him. \u201cRemember we\u2019re\nbefore a lady. Ma\u2019am, I\u2019d love to drop in once in a while and see how\nyou\u2019re making it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo it,\u201d says she, \u201cI\u2019d love to have yuh.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2019m,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cI will.\u201d\n\nShe thanks us\u2014I don\u2019t know what for\u2014and we rides away. We pilgrims off\nacross the hills towards Piperock, and we takes looks at that cabin\nuntil we\u2019re out of sight.\n\n\u201cIke, Lily is a lulu,\u201d states Magpie.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s an expression of admiration I remains torpid, but if that\napellation of lulu reflects on the lady in any way I resents it a\nheap.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet a dictionary, Ike,\u201d he grins. \u201cLulu is a Latin word meaning\n\u2018wonderful\u2019. Ain\u2019t she a wonder? Biscuits! Onions! Ike, I wish you\u2019d\nask her for her recipe for cooking coffee. I sure admire coffee that I\ndon\u2019t have to chew and what won\u2019t corrode my insides at each meal. I\nwonder if she contemplates future matrimony? She don\u2019t need to live\nalone, Ike. Reckon I ain\u2019t beyond matrimonial redemption myself. What\ndo yuh think?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf yuh don\u2019t like the way I cook coffee, Magpie, you can cook it\nyourself. And as far as matrimony and you are concerned, you\u2019d be like\na three-legged turtle trying to catch a scared wolf. There ain\u2019t\nnothing about you to catch the female fancy.\n\n\u201cIn the first place, you\u2019re too long. No woman wants to look up a\nlodge-pole all her life. An occasional glance at your face ain\u2019t going\nto hurt nobody, but as a steady diet\u2014no!\u201d\n\n\u201cFaces,\u201d he states, \u201cain\u2019t so much. Brains and companionship counts a\nheap more. You suffers a heap that-away, Ike. You\u2019re pretty in the\nface\u2014like a buffalo, and about as companionable as a porkypine, but\nwhen it comes to brains you ain\u2019t got a trump. I\u2019ll likely ride her\nway very soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe, too. Likely tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and likely yuh won\u2019t, Ike!\u201d he snorts. \u201cYou\u2019re working for me.\nSabe? You goes where I sends yuh.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you think for a holy minute that I ain\u2019t going to have no leisure\ntime, Magpie, you think again. You get too cocky, old-timer, and I\u2019ll\nquit or take a vacation. Sabe?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t fly off the handle, Ike,\u201d he advises. \u201cNobody ever said yuh\ncouldn\u2019t have no leisure time. You hops off half-cocked. Also you\u2019re\ncontrary. Did yuh ever hear about the dog what got in the manger? He\ncouldn\u2019t eat the hay, and he wouldn\u2019t let the bronc eat it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you figures yourself as the bronc in that moral, Magpie, you lose.\nYour ears are too long, old-timer. Where do yuh get the idea that I\ncan\u2019t get the lady? I made a living before I met you. The only thing I\never done that I was ashamed of was the day I pinned your star on my\nbosom. You thinks just because you\u2019re a sheriff you\u2019re better than\nmost folks. You didn\u2019t grab any honors when you beat \u2018Shep\u2019 Allen for\nsheriff. He\u2019s blind in one eye and string-halted in both legs. Just\nlet me whisper something to you, Magpie: if you don\u2019t grab some of\nthese cow thieves\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIke, you can desist. I\u2019m doing all that a mortal man can do. If I had\na deputy that was worth a cuss I\u2019d\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat\u2019s a sample of our conversation on the way home. Being partners\nfor so long, we hates to say hateful things to each other, but in a\ncase like this the truth does seep out. We gets real personal before\nwe gets to Piperock, and finds Zeb Abernathy and \u201cScenery\u201d Sims\nsetting in front of our office, waiting for us.\n\nZeb looks just like you\u2019d bet he would after hearing his name, but no\nname on earth could give an impression of Scenery. When I look at him\nI think thusly:\n\n\u201cThe person what built you, Scenery, must \u2019a\u2019 run mighty short of\nmaterial. They looks yuh over and says\u2014\u2018It ain\u2019t much of a man, but\nI\u2019ll put a squeak in it so growed-up folks won\u2019t step on it\naccidental-like.\u2019\u201d\n\nThey looks up at us as we rides in. Zeb almost unjoins his neck trying\nto expectorate across the street, crosses his legs and squints\u2014\n\n\u201cAny news, Magpie?\u201d\n\n\u201cHello, Zeb,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cNothing new. Heard anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cBank got robbed today,\u201d squeaks Scenery. \u201cDog-gone thing got\nabsolutely robbed. I been telling everybody that we ain\u2019t got no\nprotection around here. Whole sheriff\u2019s office couldn\u2019t find a ace in\na new pack of cards. Ain\u2019t yuh going to do nothing?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know something I\u2019d like to do,\u201d states Magpie, looking down at\nScenery. \u201cYou keep your squeak in your chest and let Zeb tells us\nabout it. What happened, Zeb?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile you fellers are picking flowers over in the hills a feller\nrides into town, throws down on the cashier with a gun and lopes off\nwith the treasure. He told the cashier to give you his regards. What\nyuh going to do, Magpie?\u201d\n\n\u201cCry a little,\u201d says Magpie, tired-like. \u201cI don\u2019t reckon there is much\nelse to do. Some of you folks gets the idea that just because I wears\na star all I got to do is yell, \u2018Come here, ye outlaws!\u2019 and they\u2019ll\ncome a-running.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I want to know is what are yuh going to do?\u201d squeaks Scenery.\n\u201cWhen we elects yuh sheriff\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey,\u201d corrects Magpie. \u201cYou voted for Allen, Scenery.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I got something to be proud of. I\u2019m glad that folks can\u2019t hold\nme responsible for you.\u201d\n\nHim and Zeb ambles off up-town, and we goes inside.\n\n\u201cThere ain\u2019t no joy in being a sheriff!\u201d yelps Magpie, throwing his\nboots over in the corner. \u201cYour duty sort of keeps yuh from pulling a\ngun and acting free-like. I\u2019m going out tomorrow and get that bad,\nbad-man, Ike. You watch me.\u201d\n\nThe next morning he shaves careful-like, and greases his boots.\n\n\u201cGoing to try and make a mash on him?\u201d I asks. \u201cYou ought to have some\nperfume, Magpie. You look like a bridegroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cIke,\u201d says he, ignoring the compliment, \u201cI wants you to ride up to\nSullivan Gulch, and see if anybody\u2019s living there. We got to locate\nsomething or somebody pretty soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere you going?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cInto the breaks between here and the Circle-Cross.\u201d\n\nI rides out of Piperock with joy in my heart, \u2019cause I\u2019m going in the\ngeneral direction of my heart\u2019s desire, and Magpie has gone the\nopposite. What do I care for outlaws? Duty to me is self-preservation.\n\nMe and Magpie meets at the door. We nods like distant relatives, and\neach knocks on our side of the door. The lady makes us welcome, and we\nsets down.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad to see yuh,\u201d says she, and Magpie walks plumb across the\nroom to shake hands with her.\n\n\u201cI wish I\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 known yuh was coming today,\u201d she states. \u201cI\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 had\nyuh bring me some stuff from town.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, ma\u2019am,\u201d says Magpie, \u201cif there\u2019s anything yuh want I can send\nIke after it. What\u2019s the use of having hired men if yuh don\u2019t use \u2019em.\nTell me what your heart desires.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t got no time,\u201d says I, \u201cI\u2019m headed for Sullivan Gulch. I\u2019d\nlove to do it, ma\u2019am, but I\u2019m rushed. Magpie\u2019s just loafing, so he\u2019ll\nbe glad to do it.\u201d\n\nMagpie glares at me and I glares right back at him.\n\n\u201cHow lovely,\u201d coos this here lady. \u201cIt will be lovely.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll both go, Ike,\u201d states Magpie. \u201cI got a little job of work in\nPiperock that you can attend to while I\u2019m bringing the stuff back.\nWrite out your list, ma\u2019am, and I\u2019ll deliver it right to your door.\u201d\n\nMe and Magpie pilgrims back to Piperock in silence, buys the stuff for\nthe lady, and goes down to the office.\n\nWe finds Buck Masterson on the steps.\n\n\u201cHowdy, Buck,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cWhat can I do for yuh?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, unless you improves your ways I don\u2019t reckon yuh can do\nanything,\u201d says Buck, sort of helpless-like. \u201cI been robbed!\u201d\n\n\u201c_Pshaw!_\u201d says I. \u201cHow comes that, Buck?\u201d\n\n\u201cFeller\u2014same one what robbed the bank, I reckon\u2014comes into my saloon\nthis morning, sticks a gun in my face and annexes what I got in the\nsafe. Said he knowed the sheriff was away. Say, Magpie, what in \u2014\u2014 are\nyou doing? Sending out proclamations of your absence?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t care to listen to no such conversation, so I goes inside, and\npretty soon Magpie and Buck pilgrims up-town. I takes that stuff,\nthrows it on a hoss, and points for the lady of my dreams.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nI gets almost to her place, when Magpie overtakes me. We rides up,\ndeposits stuff and partakes of a light lunch.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a outlaw-hunter,\u201d states Magpie, during the meal. \u201cIt\u2019s a\nprecarious existence, fraught with much danger, and takes a man of\nnerve.\u201d\n\n\u201cRomantic,\u201d says she. \u201cAnd what does Mister Harper do?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe holds my bronc.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile you runs,\u201d says I. \u201cMagpie don\u2019t want to be bothered with no\nbronc when he gets scared, ma\u2019am. If I was the sheriff of this county\nI\u2019d keep her swept clean of outlaws, believe me. It irks me some to\ntake orders when I know they ain\u2019t getting us no place.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you suppose I\u2019m in any danger living here alone?\u201d she asks.\n\n\u201cIf I thought you was I couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d orates Magpie. \u201cYou need the\nprotection of a man. If you\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hadn\u2019t ought to be here alone,\u201d I states. \u201cOf course I\u2019d love to\nstay here with you, but\u2014there\u2019s a preacher in Pipe-rock, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u201cPreachers ain\u2019t no protection,\u201d states Magpie. \u201cBeing sort of a legal\nguardian of this here county, I\u2019d admire to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMagpie, you ain\u2019t got no time,\u201d I reminds him. \u201cYou got to\ninvestigate that bank robbery and the one in Buck\u2019s place. You\u2019ve said\nyourself that I ain\u2019t no help to you. Why don\u2019t yuh appoint me to look\nafter the weaker sex in this county?\u201d\n\n\u201cIke, after knowing you as long as I have, I\u2019d hate to call \u2019em the\nweaker sex.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not afraid,\u201d she states. \u201cAs long as I\u2019ve got two big strong\nmen looking after me I feel safe. I do hope you can come often. Can\u2019t\nyou come tomorrow?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cOf course Ike will have to stay and tend to the\noffice routine work. It ain\u2019t much but it\u2019s got to be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cRoutine work,\u201d says I to Magpie, as we pilgrims back. \u201cWhat routine,\nMagpie?\u201d\n\n\u201cSeeing that nobody breaks into jail without showing a warrant,\u201d he\ngrins. Pretty soon he heaves a long sigh, and turns in his\nsaddle\u2014\u201cIke, it ain\u2019t going to be long before you\u2019ll be cooking grub\nfor yourself alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sure ain\u2019t,\u201d I agrees. \u201cI begins tonight. Your feller-feelings are\nparalyzed, Magpie Simpkins, and no more do I cook for an ungrateful\nhombre like you. Dang your slim soul! You ain\u2019t noways good enough for\nthat lady.\u201d\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t it true,\u201d he agrees. \u201cBut I\u2019m getting better all the time, Ike.\nDidn\u2019t yuh notice how the tears comes to her eyes, and how her breast\nheaved when I spoke about losing sleep? And then you\u2014dang yuh! You has\nto cut in with that sky-pilot talk when I\u2019m getting right down to\nbusiness. If I had five minutes alone with her I\u2019d have her hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet yuh would,\u201d I agrees. \u201cA feller what can lie as fast as you\ncan hadn\u2019t ought to take that long.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re one of the kind what makes love by main strength and\nawkwardness, Ike. Your idea of a courtship is to take a damsel by the\nhair, drag her home, slam her into a corner, and then hammer her with\na boot if she can\u2019t cook. You say I\u2019d lie to her. You got to, Ike. No\nwoman was ever told the truth when she was proposed to. She don\u2019t want\nthe truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never beat up no woman, Magpie,\u201d I advises him. \u201cAlso I ain\u2019t no\nsecond George Washington.\u201d\n\nThat night we cooks separate meals, and I got all the best of it,\n\u2019cause Magpie can\u2019t cook. The next morning he beats me to it. We\u2019ve\nonly got two eggs left, and of course he has to let mine roll off on\nthe floor. Now we\u2019re back where this tale began, with him orating\nabout breaking bread with me.\n\n\u201cOld trailer,\u201d says I, \u201cif you baked the bread, we couldn\u2019t break it.\u201d\n\nHe don\u2019t reply\u2014just snorts, so we eats on opposite sides of the shack.\n\nSome of Piperock\u2019s prominent citizens come down to see Magpie, and\ntheir conversation leads us to believe that we\u2019re incompetent. They\nhints around that they might \u2019a\u2019 made a mistake when they elects\nMagpie. Magpie sighs deep-like, and tells them to not take snap\njudgment, \u2019cause he\u2019s going out to get that feller right soon. Art\nMiller gets Magpie off to one side and speaks to him in whispers.\nMagpie shakes his head, emphatic-like, and Art acts disgusted. After\nthey\u2019re gone I asks Magpie what Art wanted.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s timid. Got some gold going out on the stage today and says he\nhates to take a chance. Said it was my duty to see that he got through\nsafe-like. Safe \u2014\u2014!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d says I. \u201cIts your duty, Magpie. I\u2019ll go up and see if\nthe lady needs anything. You can\u2019t shirk all your responsibility.\u201d\n\nMagpie smokes a while and nods:\n\n\u201cI reckon you\u2019re right, Ike. The office has to protect them what needs\nit, so I\u2019ll send you. I was thinking of the pleasant time you and me\nwas going to have up at that little cabin today, but since your\noration about duty I reckon we\u2019ll have to help Art out. You just tell\nhim I sent you for a guard. Who yuh writing to, Ike?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d says I, looking up from my labor. \u201cThis is my resignation,\nMagpie.\u201d\n\n\u201cCoward!\u201d says he, soft-like.\n\nThe Harper tribe are a peacefully inclined lot of human beings, and\nforgiving to a startling degree, but that word means light. I hits him\nin the neck, with the ink-bottle, and then we tangles.\n\nWhen we gets through I\u2019m on the floor with the stove in my lap, while\nMagpie sets half-way out of the door with a chair hung around his\nneck. Just then Scenery Sims sticks his head in the window, and yelps:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this? What\u2019s this?\u201d\n\nI lakes one of the legs off that stove, and bounces it off his head\nand yells:\n\n\u201cA draw! You squeaky fool!\u201d\n\nWe hears his boots just hitting the ground at intervals of three\nseconds, as he labors back up-town.\n\nMagpie wipes some of the blood and ink off his forehead, and glares at\nme.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re too danged touchy!\u201d he wails.\n\n\u201cWe sure do look like making social calls, now don\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t face her for a million,\u201d says he.\n\n\u201cNeither would I,\u201d says I.\n\nI cleans my face the best I can, and walks over to the door. I takes\noff my star and tosses it on the table.\n\n\u201cMagpie,\u201d says I, \u201cI\u2019m all through. No more will I chase the festive\noutlaw. From now on I\u2019m going to be a common citizen, and entitled to\ncome down here and raise thunder with you for not tending to your\nduty. I\u2019m wise to you, old-timer. Being a ordinary citizen and\nentitled to protection I hereby audibly objects to you frittering the\ncounty\u2019s time away making love. Remember, Magpie, I knows your secret.\nSabe?\u201d\n\nI goes over to the barn and saddles up. I ain\u2019t in no shape to fawn\nover a lady, but the call of love is strong upon me and I\nunconsciously rides in her direction. I forgets time and distance, and\nall of a sudden I\u2019m at her door and she\u2019s smiling at me.\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d says I, \u201cI know I looks repulsive, but my heart is in the\nright place. I been in a awful fight, and when a man\u2019s wounded he\nflies away to where his heart is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is the sheriff?\u201d she asks.\n\nThe question hurts, but I conceals my grief.\n\n\u201cWhy worry about that sandhill crane?\u201d I replies. \u201cI reckon he\u2019s\nforgot yuh already, ma\u2019am. I quit him today, and I\u2019m glad of it. I\u2019m\nof age and fancy free, ma\u2019am, I know I ain\u2019t much to look at. I\u2019m a\nregular old pelican, and I ain\u2019t so pure as snow, but I\u2019m getting\nbetter\u2014thank yuh. When a woman comes into a man\u2019s life it sure cleans\nhouse with him. The minute I sees your face I says to myself: \u2018There\nshe is, Ike. There\u2019s the one woman\u2014\u2014\u2019\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe hears the rattle of a bronc\u2019s hoofs and then\u2014\n\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d\n\nI hops to the window and sees Magpie Simpkins, and then I ducks and\nyelps:\n\n\u201cWhere can I hide? I don\u2019t want to see him.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder the bed,\u201d she whispers. \u201cHurry!\u201d\n\nI skids under the bunk. The blanket hangs almost to the floor, and\nhides me fine. She opens the door and lets Magpie in.\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d says he, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to come to see yuh looking like this, but\nI promised yuh I\u2019d come, and I\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 done it if it took my last drop\nof blood. I had a awful fight with a outlaw. All I had was my bare\nhands and ability against his modern weapons, and of course I didn\u2019t\ncome through unscathed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the outlaw?\u201d she asks, interested like. \u201cWhat of him?\u201d\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d Magpie replies, weary-like, \u201che crawled away to die. Like a\nanimile wounded unto death he crawled out of mortal sight to cash his\nchips.\u201d\n\nI hears Magpie sigh deep-like again, and then continues:\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am, I\u2019m\u2014a\u2014a common old coot. I\u2019ve lived alone so long that I can\u2019t\nseem to release the words that clamors in my bosom to be spoke. Until\nI seen your face I ain\u2019t given a thought to a double rig. I\u2019m pure in\nmind and of a forgiving nature. I asks yuh\u2014please don\u2019t smile, ma\u2019am.\nThis is a serious chore with me. I come here for succor\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA, Magpie,\u201d I corrects him, aloud. \u201cA sucker.\u201d\n\nThere is silence for some time. I hears Magpie\u2019s boots scrape\nnervous-like on the floor, and he clears his dry throat.\n\n\u201cDid\u2014did you hear somebody speak?\u201d he asks.\n\nShe must \u2019a\u2019 shook her head, \u2019cause he shuffles his feet again and\nsays:\n\n\u201cReckon I\u2019m getting jumpy. Well, ma\u2019am, what do yuh think of the\nproposition?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is Mister Harper today?\u201d she asks, ignoring his question.\n\nI peeks out from under the bed and I sees Magpie\u2019s feet real close to\nme. There\u2019s a piece of rope laying between his heels and the chair\nleg. Magpie is scared of snakes, and it gives me an idea.\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d says he, \u201clet\u2019s not speak of that person. He done me dirt.\nJust when I needs him bad he up and quits me. For why? Because he\u2019s\nscared. That feller ain\u2019t got no nerve a-tall. So long as he can lay\naround and do nothing but wear a star he\u2019s a hy-iu officer, but the\nminute he sees a little trouble showing up he quits cold. I hates a\ncoward, ma\u2019am. No man can ever say that a Simpkins flinched when\ndanger came his\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c_Z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z!_\u201d says I, and begins drawing that rope past his\nheels.\n\nHe freezes to his chair for about three seconds, and then just hits\nthe floor once before he exits through the door. I rolls out the side\nof the bed, slips the window open and drops out of the back of the\ncabin. I gets a glimpse of the lady\u2019s face as I slides over the sill,\nand she\u2019s got tears running down her face.\n\nI figured that this here ain\u2019t the proper time for me to make marriage\nproposals to the lady, and after taking one good look at her face, as\nI flopped over the window sill, I don\u2019t figure that Magpie will stand\nmuch show of getting her to sign up for life.\n\nMy bronc has drifted around to the back, which is the reason Magpie\nnever saw it, so I leads it away from there and laughs all the way\nhome.\n\nI rides up to Buck Masterson\u2019s saloon, and meets Pete Gonyer and a\nstranger. They immediate and soon surrounds me.\n\n\u201cIke, this is Mister Brand,\u201d states Pete, and I shakes the hand of\nthis stranger person. \u201cMister Brand would talk with somebody from the\nsheriff\u2019s office, Ike, so I turns him loose on you.\u201d\n\nPete wanders away and me and Mister Brand sets down on the sidewalk.\nHe pulls out a couple of photygrafts and hands \u2019em to me.\n\n\u201cLook at them and see if yuh recognize either one,\u201d says he.\n\nThere\u2019s something familiar about one of them but the other one is a\ncomplete stranger. I can\u2019t place the other one, but there\u2019s a trace\nsome place.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s \u2018Kid\u2019 Corey,\u201d says he. \u201cThis other one is \u2018Blazer\u2019 Bailey.\nThey\u2019re a clever pair. Artists in the hold-up line. I\u2019m a Federal\nofficer. They been grabbing off a lot of registered mail lately, and\nthe last stunt they pulls off was over on the main line. The Kid got\nhit, but somehow they both got away and headed across the divide in\nthis direction. You been having so much trouble over here that I\ndecides to look into it. It may not be them\u2014don\u2019t look like their\nwork, \u2019cause your cases have all been one man.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlazer is a big husky, but Corey wouldn\u2019t cause yuh to look twice. He\nused to be a sort of a actor, I believe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I can\u2019t help yuh much,\u201d says I. \u201cYuh see I ain\u2019t connected with\nthe sheriff\u2019s office no more. Maybe the sheriff can give yuh some\ninformation, but I doubt it. I know everything he does and all that I\nnaturally knows myself, but I can\u2019t help yuh none.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard some uncomplimentary things about the office,\u201d he admits,\n\u201cfolks around here seems to bare their feelings. Much obliged anyway,\nMister Harper.\u201d\n\nI goes down to the office to get my effects, when Magpie comes in. He\nsets down and pretends to read a paper.\n\n\u201cWhere yuh been?\u201d I asks, he yawns and folds up the paper. \u201cHunting\naround a little.\u201d\n\nI sets down on the table and rolls a smoke.\n\n\u201cMagpie,\u201d says I, \u201cwhat do yuh know about snakes?\u201d\n\nHe drops the paper and sets up straight in his chair. He\u2019s got sort of\na foolish look about his face, and he sort of gawps at me:\n\n\u201cUh-uh\u2014snakes? I\u2014I don\u2019t sabe, Ike?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think yuh did. A man\u2019s a sucker to ask questions of folks he\nknows can\u2019t answer \u2019em.\u201d\n\nHe uncoils from his chair, slides his gun around to the front and\nfaces me.\n\n\u201cIke, I got a question to ask you. Were you\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nJust then the door bangs open, and in comes Art Miller, all out of\nwind. He flops in a chair and pants:\n\n\u201cI\u2014I told yuh! The\u2014uh\u2014uh\u2014stage was huh-held up. About fuf-five miles\ndown the road. Took all I had\u2014dang the luck!\u201d\n\n\u201cMail, too?\u201d I asks, and he nods. \u201cEverything, I told yuh!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d says I. \u201cThat must \u2019a\u2019 been Kid Corey or Blazer Bailey.\nWorthy of your steel. Magpie.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, ain\u2019t yuh going to move?\u201d yelps Art. \u201cGoing to let \u2019em get\nplumb away as usual?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich way did they go?\u201d\n\n\u201cTowards Paradise. Yuh never can tell which way he went after he got\nout of sight.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny danged fool knows that,\u201d agrees Magpie. \u201cI reckon I better go\nafter him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckon yuh better had,\u201d pants Art, and then lopes back up-town.\n\nMagpie fusses around getting ready, oiling his guns and fixing a cinch\non his saddle.\n\n\u201cYou sure do go right after \u2019em, Magpie,\u201d says I. \u201cYou ought to be\ncalled \u2018Sudden\u2019 Simpkins. Don\u2019t let me hurry yuh. I\u2019ll go away so yuh\ncan oil your boots and shave. Haste makes waste, Magpie.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nI goes up-town, and she\u2019s boiling. They\u2019re organizing a posse to work\nindependent of the sheriff\u2019s office, but I don\u2019t join. I got sweeter\nthings to think of than killing or incarcerating my feller men. The\nlittle feller without no pants on, carrying a bow and arrer seems to\nbeckon me.\n\nI forks my bronc and rides north, lingering along, building\nair-castles and so forth. My bronc ain\u2019t none too energetic, and we\nconsumes plenty of time.\n\nI dips into a ca\u00f1on and rides up a cow trail, when a man with a\npack-animile cuts my path, and I recognizes Magpie Simpkins. I keeps\nbehind him, and pretty soon he gets off his bronc and seems to be\npicking up something off the ground. I rides up slow behind him, and\nrolls a smoke. The son-of-a-gun is so busy he don\u2019t hear me until I\nclears my throat and then he whirls around with his hands full of\nflowers.\n\nWe looks at each other for half a minute, and then he grins, sort of\nfoolish-like and holds out his hands:\n\n\u201cDaisies,\u201d says he. \u201cDaisies.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot today, little girl,\u201d says I. \u201cI ain\u2019t got no water to put \u2019em\nin.\u201d\n\n\u201cDang fool,\u201d he snorts.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought when I rode up.\u201d I agrees. \u201cFrom the looks of\nyour pack I\u2019d say you was on a protracted trip, I thought Art said the\nrobber went south.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d he nods, smelling his bouquet. \u201cI got to deliver this load\nbefore I\u2019m free to hunt outlaws, Ike.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor her?\u201d I asks, and he nods.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s paying for it, ain\u2019t she?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think I\u2019d let her?\u201d he snaps. \u201cA feller\u2019s got to do something\nfor his sweetheart, ain\u2019t he? I paid for that other load, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going down and kill that storekeeper,\u201d says I. \u201cI did, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaw!\u201d says Magpie, when I begins to laugh.\n\nHe hauls out a roll of bills, and spits on his thumb.\n\n\u201cHow much did yuh pay, Mister Harper?\u201d\n\n\u201cSeventeen-fifty,\u201d says I, and he counts it out and hands it to me.\n\u201cThat squares it, I don\u2019t want her under obligations to no other man.\nSabe?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think for a minute that you can buy me off?\u201d says I. \u201cYou think\nmy heart\u2019s love is for sale\u2014for seventeen-fifty? When did you get a\nmortgage on the lady, Mister Simpkins?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come to an understanding,\u201d he states. \u201cShe accepts my\nprotection, exclusive. Well, I must be going on. Adios.\u201d\n\nHe moves on and I rides with him. It sort of irritates him, and he\nswings around in his saddle.\n\n\u201cHarper,\u201d says he\u2014that\u2019s the first time he ever called me just\nHarper\u2014\u201cHarper, you\u2019ve heard that old saying, \u2018Three is a crowd\u2019?\nWell, I don\u2019t like crowds. Sabe?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe back-trail is open,\u201d says I, \u201cYou can\u2019t give me orders.\u201d\n\n\u201cDang you, Ike!\u201d he wails. \u201cAin\u2019t you got no finer feelings?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot since I lived with you, Magpie. You\u2019d blunt a piledriver.\u201d\n\nWe sets there and glares at each other for a spell. I rolls a smoke,\nand he follers suit.\n\n\u201cNo bowels of compassion?\u201d he asks, sad-like.\n\n\u201cNot a gut.\u201d\n\n\u201cIke,\u201d says he, after a while, \u201cwill you do me a favor? Just for old\ntimes\u2019 sake, Ike?\u201d\n\n\u201cShoot,\u201d says I.\n\n\u201cWell, Ike, I\u2014I\u2014I sort of got\u2014well, she\u2019s beginning to see things my\nway, and all I asks is ten minutes alone with her. You stay away for\nten minutes after I goes inside, and then you can come in and\ncongratulate the happy couple. Will yuh do it, Ike?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a mighty big favor, Magpie,\u201d I observes after sufficient\nthought. \u201cYou and me been more or less friendly for years and years,\nMagpie, and\u2014well, I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll give yuh ten minutes start of me.\nCut your wolf loose and go a-howling.\u201d\n\n\u201cIke,\u201d says he, with tears in his voice, \u201cyou\u2019ll never regret it. As\nsoon as we\u2019re married I\u2019ll have you up to supper.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you can propose in ten minutes, Magpie, I\u2019ll cook for you all the\nrest of your life for nothing. Propose in ten minutes! Why, you can\u2019t\nspit inside of fifteen. Go ahead and have it over with.\u201d\n\nWe pilgrims on until we tops a hill above her cabin. I stops there and\nlets Magpie go on down. I\u2019m to stick there until I figures that I can\nmake the cabin ten minutes after he goes inside.\n\nI rolls a smoke and watches him take his animile around to the back,\nand then open the door and walk right inside.\n\n\u201cGetting danged familiar,\u201d says I to my bronc. \u201cGoing in without\nknocking.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m glancing around the landscape, when I sees two men on hosses cut\nacross behind me not a quarter of a mile away. Suddenlike I sees some\nmore off to my left. They\u2019re acting queer, so I spurs my bronc for a\nbetter place to see.\n\n_Zow-w-w-w. Flup-p-p-p._\n\nA bullet goes past my ear, and another sticks into the ground a few\nfeet short and fills my bronc\u2019s eyes full of sand.\n\n\u201cBronc,\u201d says I, \u201csomebody desires our de-mise. Let\u2019s away.\u201d\n\nI sticks the spurs in his ribs, and races down the hill. That cabin is\nthe best cover in sight and, while I may be a little ahead of time, I\nfeels that Magpie will forgive me.\n\nI hits that door just ahead of a handful of lead and sort of busts up\nthe courtship. The lady looks sort of sick, and when I busts in Magpie\npulls his guns.\n\n\u201cEverybody get down low!\u201d I yelps.\n\n\u201cWho and what is it, Ike?\u201d asks Magpie, ducking when a bullet dusts\nsome of the mud from between the logs near his face.\n\n\u201cDanged if I know! They smokes me up and chases me here.\u201d\n\n\u201cSave me!\u201d yelps the lady, sprawling on the bunk. \u201cI\u2019m sick as \u2014\u2014!\u201d\n\nSuch language makes me glance up, but I glues my eyes back to that\ncrack again, where I got some chinking pushed out. I sees a bronc\u2019s\nlegs, so I elevates the muzzle of my gun and salutes him.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nA couple of bullets whispers logs, so I rolls over past the bed. My\nelbow bumps on something, and I glances down.\n\n\u201cCome here!\u201d I yells. \u201cHere\u2019s a cellar!\u201d and I begins tugging at the\ncarpet what covers the door. If the carpet hadn\u2019t been ripped I\u2019d \u2019a\u2019\nnever found it. Magpie skids over to me on his hands and knees, and\nbegins heaving on the handle.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d yelps the lady. \u201cDon\u2019t go down there! There\u2019s a\u2014a\u2014snake down\nthere!\u201d\n\n\u201cPreferable to hot lead,\u201d I yells, and slips over the square hole in\nthe floor.\n\nMagpie don\u2019t wait to crawl down\u2014he hopped. _Bang._ A gun explodes\nright at my lower extremity, and I feels that I got to buy a new pair\nof suspenders. It sure was close. I lets loose and drops about seven\nfeet. The door drops back and we\u2019re in darkness.\n\n\u201cDid I fall on yuh, Ike?\u201d asks Magpie.\n\n\u201cYou did not,\u201d says I, groping around.\n\n\u201cWell, I fell on somebody,\u201d he proclaims. \u201cGot a match handy?\u201d\n\nI lights a match and sees Magpie setting on a man\u2019s stummick. The\nfeller looks sort of yaller in the face, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s got\nmuch fight left in his carcass, He\u2019s still got a gun in his hand, the\nsame of which we removes. Magpie looks him over and snaps some\nbracelets on his wrists.\n\n\u201cSafety first, Ike,\u201d says he. Another match shows a rifle against the\nwall. Sudden-like Magpie remembers.\n\n\u201cGosh, Ike! We\u2019ve forgot the lady!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a box down there, which we hauls over under the door. Magpie\nclimbs up and lifts the trap so we can see, and it sure is some\ntableau.\n\nThe door is open. There stands that feller Brand, with a grin on his\nface, and behind him is all the Piperock population that can crowd in.\nThe lady is standing there against the wall, and all to once she drops\nher hand.\n\n_Bang_ This Brand person\u2019s gun comes up and explodes, and the lady\nfalls on her face. Magpie moves some quick. He flops out of that\ncellar, whirls on the crowd with a gun in each hand.\n\n\u201cYou danged coward!\u201d he yelps at Brand. \u201cShoot a defenseless woman,\nwill yuh! Drop your guns!\u201d\n\nEvery gun in sight hit the ground, and the lady staggers to her feet.\n\n\u201cGive me a gun,\u201d she pants at Magpie, but Magpie just stares at her.\n\nI takes a look and stares a few lines myself. Her hair is on her\nshoulder\u2014plumb off her head, and the hair of her head is brown and\nparted on the side.\n\n\u201cUh\u2014uh\u2014\u201d stutters Magpie.\n\nBrand steps over and takes the guns out of Magpie\u2019s unresisting hands.\nBrand turns to the partly scalped person:\n\n\u201cBetter set down, Kid. You got plenty of nerve, but we seem to have\ngot you this time, eh? Little pale around the gills.\u201d\n\n\u201cPale around the gills, eh?\u201d snarls the person. \u201cDang you, Brand, you\nwould be too. That blasted fresh sheriff busted in a while ago without\nknocking and I had to swaller my chew. I been too sick to fight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Blazer?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the cellar with irons on.\u201d says I. \u201cWe\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 had this Kid Corey,\ntoo, if yuh hadn\u2019t been so blasted previous. Any time yuh don\u2019t think\nthis sheriff\u2019s office is on the job yuh got another think coming.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose that\u2019s why Simpkins threw a gun down on me when I shot at\nthe Kid,\u201d laughs Brand. \u201cDid I hit yuh, Kid?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, dang yuh! It burnt my ribs, so I drops safe. I\u2019m just getting\nover one chunk of lead in the shoulder. That\u2019s why I had to let my\nhand down, Brand. It hurt like thunder. I told that fool of a Blazer\nto lay low with me, but he thought we had some easy pickings around\nhere. I kept cases on the sheriff\u2019s office, that\u2019s about all I was\nable to do. Didn\u2019t I make a good female?\u201d\n\n\u201cMagpie ain\u2019t to blame,\u201d says I. \u201cI\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 likely fell, too, if I\u2019d \u2019a\u2019\nbeen as susceptible as Magpie. He was wise to Blazer, but not to the\nKid. I reckon the money is in that box in the cellar, ain\u2019t it, Kid?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere ain\u2019t no use lying about it\u2014it is,\u201d he states.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019d like to know is this,\u201d states Ricky Henderson, \u201cwho was we\nshooting at? Was it Blazer or the Kid?\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither one,\u201d says I. \u201cYou was shooting at me. Danged fools try to\ntake the law in their own hands and mess things up. Think the sheriff\ndon\u2019t know his business, and\u2014gosh, I sure do hate a posse.\u201d\n\nWe deposits the Kid and Blazer in jail, and then me and Magpie goes\nback to our shack. I puts on some water for coffee, and then turns to\nMagpie.\n\n\u201cShall I make coffee like she did?\u201d I asks.\n\nMagpie lays his hat on the table.\n\n\u201cIke, you make it according to the old formula. I\u2019m sick for a cup of\nreal coffee.\u201d He smokes for a while and then\u2014\u2014\n\n\u201cIke, old-timer, we been a pair of fools.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave been,\u201d I agrees. \u201cLucky fools, Magpie. Luck in finding that\ntrap-door: lucky that I didn\u2019t give you ten whole minutes alone with\nher\u2014him. You might \u2019a\u2019 proposed, Magpie. Aw, yes, you would,\nold-timer, \u2019cause you was loco with love. Did yuh kiss her\u2014him,\nMagpie?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo-o-o. I was going to, Ike\u2014honest to gosh! But I sudden-like\nrecognized that picture, which we deciphers to be her dear departed,\nand then I didn\u2019t. Sabe?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, ho! So you lost heart when yuh recognized him, eh? Who was he?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Ike, she didn\u2019t lie about it\u2014now, did she? She only said he was\na good man. He sure was, Ike. Best they ever made.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bite, Magpie. Who was he?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbraham Lincoln.\u201d",
