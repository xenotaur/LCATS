    "body": "\n[Sidenote: What strange dimension was this where giants, gangsters,\nLucretia Borgia, dwarfs and Rip Van Winkle lived at the same time?]\n\n\n\"Too bad, Griffin,\" Hale Jenkins said to the man alongside. \"Now if\nyou'd have just stuck to bank stick-ups, you'd have been all right.\"\n\n\"Nah!\" Bud Griffin said, his mouth twisted in a wry grin. \"I'd have been\nall right if you'd have just stuck to being a traffic cop. But you had\nto show the Commissioner you were on the ball, so he sent you after me.\nThat's all.\"\n\nThe light suddenly flashed over the pilot's compartment with its warning\nto fasten safety belts. A few seconds later, the stewardess came around\nwith a smiling warning that they were coming over some bad pockets, and\nthat there was no need to worry.\n\nBoth men fastened their belts, as did all the other passengers on the\ngiant airliner, and after a while the elevator began its ride. Griffin\nreached up and pulled the air vent down, so that the cold air of the\nupper reaches at which they were flying could send its refreshing drafts\nof air down the vent. Jenkins had been airsick once and didn't want any\nmore of the same. He followed Griffin's gaze, and looked into the grey\nfog of a huge cloud bank.\n\nJenkins, to get his mind off the possibility of getting sick again, took\nup where the other had left off: \"Yeah. But like I say, you shoulda\nstuck to robbin' banks.\"\n\nHis lean, strong face with the unusual bone structure which made it a\nface of highlights and plane surfaces, broke into a wide-angled grin. He\nthrew the shock of black hair from his eyes, and continued: \"Guys like\nyou never learn. Gotta work with a heater.\"\n\nGriffin's opaque eyes shifted from the greyness which had encircled the\nplane, and met the dancing grey ones of the detective beside him.\nGriffin's lips mimicked the grin of the other. But his words were not so\nlight-hearted: \"Look, copper! You just got lucky. If it weren't for that\ndame.... Aah! I shoulda been smart. I shoulda known she'd of sung. No\ndame can keep her yap shut! But get this. We ain't in yet! So be smart\nand don't think Bud Griffin's fryin'. Not yet he ain't.\"\n\nJenkins was, for a detective, a rather amiable sort. In Griffin's case,\nhowever, he could not help but give an occasional needle. The hoodlum\nand murderer's bragging rasped on Jenkins' nerves.\n\n\"Now, don't blame the girl,\" Jenkins said. \"She was just the last step\nin my trail. The guy who really talked was Bud Griffin. There's a\ncharacter who'll never stop talkin'. If you hadn't talked to the\nbartender in that joint on the waterfront, I'd have never found out\nabout Myrtle. But he knew Myrtle and the kind of girl she was; he knew\nshe only went for the hoods who had dough, and no guy who drinks beer\nlike you do and leaves no tips ought to have dough. So when Myrtle walks\nin with a platina fox jacket and says you bought it, he gets mighty\nsuspicious.\n\n\"It was a cinch then, Bud. All I had to do was tell the girl she was\ngoing to be named as an accessory after the fact, and she spilled her\nload.\"\n\n\n\nPin points of flame suddenly danced in Griffin's eyes. His hands, lying\nquiescent on his lap, curled into balls of bone and muscle. Griffin had\nmany weaknesses; of them all, anger was his greatest. For in the heat of\nanger he would do anything, and not care about the consequences. It had\nproved his undoing many times. His last surge of anger had resulted in\nmurder during a robbery. The victim had resisted Griffin and had been\nshot in cold blood. As always, that anger showed in visible signs: there\ncame the pin points of flame to the eyes, the clenching of fists, and an\nodd curling of the mouth. But Jenkins, either because he did not know of\nthese signs, or because he was so wrapped in his own glory, did not\nnotice the other's shifting movement.\n\nWhen Griffin struck, it was with electric speed. Certainly, he had\nnothing to gain by his attack on Jenkins. For had he thought it out\nlogically, he would have realized there was no way of escape. Even a\nfool would have realized that there was no way of getting out of a plane\nwhich was flying at ten thousand feet, and coming down alive, unless one\nhad a chute. So it was sheer berserk anger which prompted the attack.\n\nGriffin's right elbow shot up and sideways, and landed with telling\nforce against Jenkins' jaw. At almost the same instant, he slipped loose\nof his safety belt, whirled on his companion and struck him two savage\nblows with his fists. Those blows stunned the detective. And like a\nsnake in movement, Griffin's hand reached for the pistol in Jenkins'\nholster and drew it.\n\nDazed as Jenkins was, he tried to stop Griffin. The barrel of the gun\nslashed a furrow in his cheek for the try. The blow rocked the\ndetective's head back, and allowed him to get out of his seat. In an\ninstant he was in the aisle, leaping for the pilot's compartment. He had\nno plan; he wasn't even thinking. In the background of his mind he knew\nthe panic he had created; he could see it reflected in the face of the\nwoman in the front seat, in the wide, suddenly terror-stricken eyes of\nthe man at her side. But what he was going to do when he reached the\nclosed door that was his goal, he did not know.\n\nThere were screams and hoarse commands. From the rear, the stewardess\nshouted for him not to go beyond the door. Griffin reached it, whirled\nand faced the length of the plane, a snarl on his lips, and the .38 in\nhis hand, a small-barreled threat of death to whoever was fool enough to\nattempt to stop him.\n\nAnd there was one who was going to be a fool.\n\n\n\nWhether Jenkins was just dazed by the last blow, or whether he really\nthought he could stop the other, is a matter of conjecture. But he rose\nto his feet and started forward in a stumbling run.\n\n\"Come on, copper,\" Griffin grunted, a terrible smile of anticipation on\nhis lips. \"I been wantin' to knock you off.\"\n\nEveryone on the plane froze in horror as the gun muzzle came up. The\nfinger on the trigger tightened in a sort of slow-motion action until it\nseemed as if the smallest pressure would set it off. And still Jenkins\nstumbled forward, until only a couple of feet separated the two. Then\nthe grin became a snarl on Griffin's lips, and all knew the instant of\ndeath had arrived.\n\nJenkins must have felt it also, for he took the last few steps in a\nshambling, wide-armed leap, as if he were welcoming it. It was at that\ninstant that the co-pilot decided to step through the door. The steel\ndoor slammed against the bent figure of the gunman just as he pulled the\ntrigger. The gun went off with a roar, and Jenkins hit Griffin like a\ntackler slamming into a ball carrier.\n\nBut louder than the pistol's sound, was the sound from without the\nplane. It was as if all the fury of hell had exploded out there. The\nplane became a straw licked upward and outward, sucked downward and\ninward, in some vortex of sound and fury which was completely\nunrecognizable. It was as if some external force was venting its spleen\non the craft. In the space of split seconds, in the time a picture forms\nin a mind, the plane and all its occupants lost their meaning.\n\nThere was a great rending sound and, following, the disintegration of\nthe great ship into space.\n\n\n\nHale Jenkins felt himself spinning, whirling, falling into a vast empty\nfog. There was peace and contentment in that fog, and a sort of\nforgetfulness. There was nothing above and nothing below, just the grey\nmurk. For a last instant of awareness, Jenkins saw not far from him the\nbody of Griffin describing the same gyrations as his own. Then there was\na wrenching at his bowels, a tearing at his brain, and unconsciousness\nslipped over him like the noose over the hanged man.\n\nOdd piping voices penetrated into Jenkins' brain. He stirred and rolled\nover, and after a few seconds got his hands under him and pushed himself\nerect. He felt rather than saw the tree close to him, and put one hand\nout to its friendly trunk, steadying himself against it. His head came\nup after a second and his eyes cleared of the fog before them. He stared\nin disbelief as he looked out over a great valley.\n\nIn the distance, made plain by the brilliant light of the sun, he saw a\ntremendous castle with many-turreted immense sides. It shimmered and\ndanced in the brilliant light, like a mirage conjured by a fevered mind.\nYet he knew, without being told, that it was real--as real as the three\ntiny men who regarded him with passionately intent though oddly\nfrightened eyes from a few feet off.\n\nBut sight was not the only sense of which Jenkins had the full use. He\nwas aware of an odd, rumbling sound in the distance, as of thunder, yet\nnot quite thunder. He noticed that the gnomes had also heard the sound,\nfor their eyes turned from their intent regard of him, to the castle\nperched on the mesa in the distance. He could not see their eyes now,\nyet he was aware that they held fear--cold, numbing fear--fright so\ngreat it binds the entrails, makes a stone statue of a man, even a\ndwarf.\n\nThey held their poses even after the dying sounds of the strange rumble\nhad passed in the distance. When Jenkins spoke, it took several seconds\nfor them to bring their attention to him:\n\n\"Where am I and who are you?\"\n\nTheir answering voices were childish pipings, making even less sense of\na confused situation:\n\n\"I am Loti ...\" said the smallest, who wore a fringe of beard from his\nforehead all the way around a pointed, slat-like chin.\n\n\"I am Gaino,\" said the second. He had a hooked nose so long it almost\ntouched his chin.\n\n\"I am Mikas,\" said the third, who had a round face, a bulbous nose whose\ncolor was that of a ripe tomato, flapping pointed ears too large for his\nface, and a pair of perfectly round eyes.\n\n\"Yeah? But where am I?\" Jenkins persisted.\n\n\"In the land of Gnat,\" all three piped in unison.\n\nSlowly the brain-fog was clearing for Jenkins. The miracle of his\nlanding safely was still not quite clear, nor could he understand the\npresence of these odd beings. But as reason returned to Jenkins, it told\nhim something had happened which would perhaps be unexplainable.\n\nHe pointed toward the castle and said: \"Who lives there?\"\n\n\"Lucretia ...\" they answered again in unison.\n\nNow there's a familiar name, Jenkins thought, while at the same time a\nhorrifying idea occurred to him. If it were Lucretia Borgia, he thought,\nthen he might be dead. Suddenly, there was a spine-chilling roar, a vast\ncrashing in the underbrush close by, and a tremendous boulder sailed by\nand disappeared over the lip of the chasm. Its crashing echoes could be\nheard for a long time afterward. When Jenkins recovered his balance, the\ngnomes had disappeared.\n\nJenkins' eyes narrowed in search of them, but after one look at the\nthick underbrush, he turned aside and began to search for a path leading\neither through the brush or down the steep sides of the cliff. There\nwasn't much choice, he discovered. In fact, there was no choice at all.\n\n\n\n\"Ho-ho!\" a stentorian voice bellowed, seemingly from at his very heels.\n\"Look what we have here!\"\n\nOnce more Jenkins did a pirouette. Facing him were three men. They\nseemed to come in series of threes in this screwy place, he thought. But\nthese were quite different than the gnomes he had first seen.\n\nThese were giants, all dressed in the same manner. Each wore the skin of\na wild animal draped about him. Only their middles were covered, and\ntheir immensely broad and hairy chests and legs, which were like\ntree-trunks, stood out in naked and unpretty relief. They had not known\nthe touch of a razor for a very long time. Their beards reached almost\nto their waists, while their heads were crowned with a tangled growth of\nwiry brush.\n\nEach man was armed with a spiked club, on which he was resting as he\nregarded the stranger.\n\n\"He's mine,\" one said suddenly. \"I saw him first.\"\n\n\"No!\" the second said. \"You're the youngest. I'm the oldest. I get him.\"\n\n\"And I'm the strongest,\" said the third. \"I'll take him.\" The last one\ndidn't wait for a reply, but leaped for Jenkins in a clumsy jump.\n\nOnly Jenkins didn't wait for him. He stepped aside as the giant came on,\nand as he went past Jenkins tripped him by simply putting out his leg.\nThe giant went sailing off into space and as he stumbled over the lip of\nthe chasm, his scream of fear was drowned in the roars of rage which\ncame from the other two. They came at him on splay feet, their clubs\nraised high, their mouths opened and their eyes slitted in rage. But\nthey were slow and clumsy, and Jenkins danced out of range.\n\nThe giants recovered their balance, turned and came at him again, this\ntime from opposite sides. Jenkins waited until they were almost upon him\nbefore moving. The two had their clubs raised as they ran, and just as\nJenkins leaped, they swung their murderous weapons. If it weren't for\nthe deadly seriousness of the situation, Jenkins would have found vast\nhumor in it. For in the swinging, both missed him, but one, the\nyoungest, caught his partner squarely on the skull with the spiked club.\nThe stricken one fell like an ox at the slaughter.\n\n\n\nSlobbering sounds of rage came from the remaining giant. His beady eyes\nwere red-rimmed, and his voice shook in passion as he charged again. And\nonce more Jenkins danced away. But this time the smile was wiped from\nthe Earthman's lips, as his moving steps struck against a protruding\nroot, and he went sprawling backward.\n\nRage turned to triumph! The club came on high and began its descent. And\nJenkins could only watch it in horror. The terrible club gained speed,\nsize, terror in its immensity, as it descended. And Jenkins seemed\nchained to the earth by a power greater than his will. The club was\ninches away, and Jenkins closed his eyes to it and made a silent prayer.\n\nThere was a dull thud as the club dropped from the giant's hand to the\nground. And another thud as the body of the giant landed with\nbreath-taking force across that of the Earthman. Jenkins grunted in\npain. He shoved at the inert figure sprawled across him and rolled it to\none side. His breath whistled through his nostrils as he arose and\nbrushed the dirt from him and he wondered dully how he had been saved.\n\n\"They are as children,\" a voice replied to his unspoken question. \"And\nlike children, they can't reason ...\"\n\nThe whistle came from his lips this time, as he did a double-take at the\nfigure which confronted him. She was standing not three feet from him, a\ntall, lissome figure, dressed in a sheer costume which hid her figure,\nyet left enough to be seen to entrance the eye. Midnight black hair, a\nbeautifully carved throat, perfection for nose and lips, and eyes\nhaughty as a queen's, made up the rest of her. He could only stare,\nopen-mouthed in admiration, lost in her beauty.\n\nA faint smile touched her lips as she advanced toward him. He caught the\nmovement of others, also, and from the corners of his eyes saw that she\nhad not come alone. Attending her were mailed bodyguards wearing\nsixteenth century armor.\n\n\"I thought the other came alone,\" Lucretia said, \"but now I see I was\nwrong. He is up there. You will be there, too.\"\n\n\"Up there?\" Jenkins asked somewhat foolishly, pointing to the castle in\nthe distance.\n\n\"Yes. Up there. Come along, now.\" She turned and moved away from him,\nand the mailed men took her place.\n\nThis time Jenkins made no move of protest. The long swords and small\nknives these men carried in their belts made foolish any attempt to\nfight them.\n\n\n\nIt took a great deal less time to reach the castle than Jenkins would\nhave thought possible. Yet, there were no means of transportation other\nthan walking. The castle was much like one Jenkins remembered in a movie\nhe had seen. A huge drawbridge swung down over the wide and deep moat\nbefore the perpendicular walls of the castle, trumpets sounded and\nmailed guards ran to appointed places at the castle's entrance. The\nbeautiful creature nodded in acknowledgment of their salute as she\nstepped past them, Jenkins at her side and the eight bodyguards, two\nabreast, walking behind. Thus they proceeded up the long and narrow\ncourtyard through another entrance, and into an inner courtyard which\npreceded the entrance hall proper to the castle.\n\nThings happened at a greater pace from then on. At her signal men came\nforward, took Jenkins with them and, from then until his return to the\nwoman, he was bathed, shaved, and dressed in a wondrously brocaded gown.\nWhen he returned, it was to find her in the immense banquet hall.\n\nShe motioned him forward and bade him sit at her right. His eyes went\nwide when he saw who was at her left--Griffin. And dressed in a gown\nsimilar to his own.\n\n\"Hi, chum,\" Griffin said. \"Nice layout, huh?\"\n\n\"I like him,\" Lucretia said, as she signalled for the food to be brought\nin. \"He has such ill manners and such a boorish way of expressing\nhimself.\"\n\nJenkins swallowed in haste as his eyes took in the rest of the company\naround the table. Never in all his days of police work had he seen such\na collection of cutthroats. Yet they, as he, were dressed in finery that\nwas worth a fortune. They saw his stare and answered him with wide\ngrins, which somehow had the power to make his blood run cold.\n\n\"Aah!\" she continued. \"They like you, I see. Ah, well. It's company fit\nfor a Borgia.\"\n\nBorgia--Lucretia Borgia--the infamous poisoner--the most hated woman of\nher time. He turned for another quick look and wondered how a woman with\nsuch beauty could.... He shook his head violently. And again she seemed\nto read his mind.\n\n\"My beauty is something I had nothing to do with. Perhaps you may come\nto hate it.\"\n\n\n\nSuddenly a vast anger filled Jenkins' breast. His nostrils dilated in\npassion, and when he spoke his voice was hoarse with it: \"Look! I don't\nknow what's going on. But whatever it is, I don't like it. Now get this!\nI'm a cop, and the character sitting alongside of you is my prisoner.\nAnd I'm going to take him come hell or high water!\"\n\nA ripple of laughter began which swelled to a roar as he finished. And\nthe one who laughed the loudest was Lucretia.\n\n\"Now tell me, my valorous warder,\" she said in dulcet tones, \"how will\nyou do this?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Jenkins answered darkly and somewhat foolishly. \"But\nI'll manage. And another thing,\" he went on after a few seconds, \"what's\nwith this rigmarole you're playing?\"\n\n\"Rigmarole?\" Her voice broke into tinkling laughter. \"Oh, come now! We\ndon't play games here. I'm really Borgia. So let us sup. Talk will come\nlater.\"\n\nA servant had placed a dish before Jenkins from which the most\nappetizing odors arose. Saliva formed in his mouth, and his empty belly\nreminded him he hadn't eaten for a long time. He raised his fork and\nstarted to dig in, but the gesture was never completed. For suddenly he\nbecame aware that every eye was on him and that every mouth was twisted\nin a grin, that laughter hung silently on the air ready to explode at\nthe right second. They were but waiting for him to taste the food.\n\nNerveless fingers dropped the fork, and Jenkins' gulp was audible. He\nknew why the grins and stares. _The food was poisoned!_ Yet the others\nwere eating, loudly, gaspingly, tearing at the food with fingers and\njaws, eating as though it was the last meal they were ever to have.\n\n\"Come, man! Eat!\" the woman said between mouthfuls. She, like the rest,\nheld little regard for manners.\n\n\"I--I'm not hungry,\" Jenkins said lamely.\n\n\"Too bad. It's so good!\" Lucretia remarked. Her eyes were daring him.\n\nThere seemed to be dozens of courses, and Jenkins' hunger grew with each\nserving. More than hunger seethed in his breast, however. Anger also\ngnawed at him. Anger got the better at last. He shoved his chair from\nthe table, and it clattered backward on stumbling legs. All eyes turned\nto him as he stood, his hands on his hips, his head shoved forward, chin\njutting out like a rock.\n\n\"I've had just about enough of this!\" Jenkins announced loudly. \"I'm\ngoing. And you, Griffin, are coming with me.\"\n\nGone now were the smiles; gone the laughter. The eyes were cold and\noddly expectant. Jenkins grew aware of the tense silence. He grinned,\nand began to withdraw slowly.\n\n\"Okay,\" he said softly, \"so I'll go alone.\"\n\n\"Not even that way,\" Lucretia said. \"My guests leave only at _my_\nbidding.\"\n\n\n\nAs though her words were a command, two of the men at opposite ends of\nthe table rose and started for Jenkins. Their hands were wrapped about\nthe hilts of the short swords stuck in their belts. Jenkins continued to\nretreat slowly, though, until his foot struck against the chair which\nhe'd shoved back. Then he moved like greased lightning.\n\nHis right hand swept around, gathered up the chair and flung it skidding\nacross the floor, so that it wound up among the folds of the robe worn\nby one of the men. At the same time Jenkins leaped toward his other\nwould-be attacker and chopped a right hook to his whiskered chin.\n\nIt was the signal for a general rush in Jenkins' direction, but Jenkins\nwasn't waiting. He hadn't even waited to see the effect of his hook. The\ninstant the blow was delivered, he had turned and leaped for the wide\nentrance. He ran with all speed, his mind busy trying to remember the\nturns and danger points which might lie before him.\n\nThere was no need of that, he discovered. The shouting voices which\nbayed the alarm brought other guards to the chase. Jenkins came to a\nsliding halt as he made a turn in the corridor. The grin was still wide\non his lips when his capturers brought him back to face Lucretia.\n\n\"I find it unseemly,\" she said as the guards forced him into a chair,\n\"that a guest should feel so strongly about not wanting my hospitality.\nSurely, I have not been amiss in my attentions? If so, I must remedy\nthat.\"\n\nA roar of laughter went up at the words.\n\n\"Therefore,\" she went on, \"we will do more than we have. Take him below\nand make him feel as welcome as he should have felt from the beginning.\"\n\n\n\nSweat streamed from the dank walls. Feeble light came from a pair of\ntorches set into wall brackets, light which was offset by the heavy\nsmoke the resinous torches gave forth. A dozen cloaked figures stood\naround the almost naked figure of a man chained wrists, ankles, and neck\nto the wall. Standing directly in front of the chained man, and facing\nhim, was another man, with a look of cunning cruelty on his face. The\none chained to the wall was Jenkins; and the man facing him was Griffin.\n\n\"Look, my friend,\" Lucretia Borgia said to Griffin, \"all about you are\nthe implements of the trade. Here,\" she pointed with daintily gesturing\nfingers to a many-thonged whip, \"is a tickler to make this fool dance.\nAnd when he tires, why here,\" she pointed to something which looked like\na coal scuttle, \"we have a bucket in which he can rest his wearied feet.\nOf course you may have to heat it a trifle, but I'm sure he won't mind.\"\n\nThe others shouted in glee at the humor they found in her remark.\n\nJenkins listened in bitter silence. The only visible sign of his\ndesperate feelings was a tiny trickle of blood which seeped from one\ncorner of his mouth and ran down to the side of his chin. He had given\nup straining against the steel chains which bound him. They had been set\ntoo strongly into the wall. He prayed that he could take the physical\ntortures to be inflicted on him without weakening.\n\nThen Griffin was reaching for the steel-tipped whip, and Jenkins braced\nhimself for the pain.\n\n\"Make him dance!\" Lucretia commanded. \"Pride needs music....\" She\nstopped suddenly and her head came up. The others also froze into\nlistening attitudes.\n\nJenkins had been aware of the odd sound for several minutes. He had\npresumed that the others were too interested in what was going on down\nin the cold, dank dungeon to be disturbed by sounds from the upper\nworld. The sound had a rumbling vibration, the rumble grew louder and\nlouder, and suddenly there was an ear-splitting crash. Dust and chips\nflew from the walls.\n\n\"The giants!\" Lucretia screamed in wild terror. \"They are bowling\nagain.\"\n\n\n\nAs one, everybody turned and began a pell-mell race for the stairs,\nuntil there was only the chained man left. And hard at their heels came\nanother of the ear-splitting crashes. More chips flew, and now tiny\nstreamers of water leaped from cracks which appeared in the stone. Again\nthere was the roar, another crash, and Jenkins moaned in pain as a large\nchunk of rock struck his side and tore the flesh.\n\nHe strained against the steel chains which bound him until he thought\nhis blood would burst the bounds of his veins. He pulled again and again\nand until he could strain no more, until he could only fall limply\nagainst his prison-links.\n\nHis mind was fevered and his thoughts jumbled. He had to escape somehow.\nAgain there was heard that terrorizing crash. He gasped, and turned his\nhead aside, as a torrent of water poured from a fissure in the rock\nclose to his head and shot into his face.\n\nHe turned his head and felt the metal tear from the wall. His head was\nfree. Like a madman, Jenkins tried again to loose himself. This time he\nsucceeded. And where the chains pulled free, water dribbled from that\nspot.\n\nWith a desperate intensity, Jenkins made a superhuman effort and pulled\nat the chains binding his wrists. The chains came apart, tearing the\nflesh and leaving raw wounds. Wincing at the pain, he placed his fingers\nbehind his neck and felt of the steel. After a few seconds of probing,\nhe twisted at the nut, which separated from the bolt with a single easy\ntwist. He did the same with the chain binding his ankles--and Jenkins\nwas free!\n\nThe last length of chain fell into the water, which by now had formed a\nfoot-deep puddle on the floor, and splashed loudly, as Jenkins raced\nagainst a new danger. Whatever was causing those crashing sounds was\nalso weakening the foundations of the castle. Water was beginning to\npour in a perfect torrent from many cracks. The stairs to the floor\nabove was but twenty feet from where he had been chained, but even in\nthat short distance the water rose another foot.\n\n\n\nJenkins took the wide stone steps three at a time, and raced like wild\naround the short curves. He had oriented himself as they brought him\ndown, and he knew exactly where he was going. Danger lay at the very top\nof the stairs, for here they were heavily guarded. Yet, when he reached\nthe head of the stairs, not a soul was to be seen.\n\nHe became cautious, then. Being weaponless, Jenkins knew he would have\nto rely on stealth. Slowly he advanced, until he was at the very\nthreshold of the large banquet hall. Now he heard voices, voices raised\nin anger.\n\nThe loudest, most shrill of these voices, the one who commanded\nattention, was that of Lucretia Borgia: \"You fools! Dolt heads! When\nthis is over I shall have you all flayed alive. Did not any of you\nrecognize the king of the giants as the one who was fighting the\nstranger? Now they are _bowling_ against us. And who among us can\nchallenge them?\"\n\n\"I can, baby.\" Jenkins recognized that voice. It belonged to Griffin.\n\"Duck pins, ten pins or any other kind. I'll match my hook with the best\nof them.\"\n\nThere was a short interval of silence. When Lucretia broke it, she spoke\nin more natural tones: \"It isn't the giants I'm worried about. I have\nseen them bowl. They rely on strength only. The dwarfs are the ones I'm\nworried about. We beat them the last time because they used the man from\nEarth and we got him drunk. They are cunning little men. Are you sure,\nmy friend, that you have the skill?\"\n\nBut Jenkins didn't wait to hear the answer. He knew Griffin had the\nskill. For Griffin, in his varied and checkered career, had once won an\nA.B.C. tournament. It was the clue by which he had been able to trace\nGriffin in his chase across the continent.\n\nJenkins peered into the hall. The men were all clustered around the\nwoman, listening intently to her words. Silently, he fled from the\nbanquet hall, and in a single leap crossed the open courtyard. From\nthere on he threw caution to the winds. Oddly enough he could have\nwalked, for not a single guard was to be seen even at the gate to the\ndrawbridge. Although the bridge was up, Jenkins didn't hesitate for an\ninstant. He dived in, and the waters of the moat closed over him.\n\nBut the moat was not wide, nor was it too deep. Ten strokes and he was\nacross. The moon flooded the night with light, and his path was clear\nbefore him. After reaching the opposite bank, Jenkins started for the\ndepths of the forest. But just as he reached it an odd procession\nmarched out.\n\n\n\nAt the head were the three dwarfs Jenkins had first met upon recovering\nconsciousness. Behind them streamed a host of other dwarfs. And from\nwhat was evidently another path into the forest came another procession.\nAlthough this group was not as large in number, in size the men were\ngigantic. The two processions saw Jenkins at the same time, and both\ngroups started toward him. Had it not been for the three little men,\nJenkins couldn't imagine what fate might have befallen him.\n\n\"Ho!\" shouted the dwarf called Loti. \"It is the one who was taken to the\ncastle. Come, my friend, we go to the castle. To bowl. For the _good\nwoman_ who rules there has made the mistake which might free us of her\nrule.\n\n\"She permitted one of our giant brethren to be killed by one of her men.\nAnd now we go to bowl against her champions. See, Mikas carries our\nball.\"\n\nJenkins looked at the one to whom Loti had gestured, and saw that in\ntruth the little man was carrying a bowling ball, a ball which was in no\nway different from those Jenkins had himself used in his world.\n\n\"Aye,\" Loti continued. \"Now we have again the chance to rid ourselves of\nher shackles.\"\n\nThe leaders of the giants had joined them while they were talking. One\nof them interrupted: \"Aye. Loti is right. We sent the boulders down\nagainst them from the heights. Now we go to bowl.\"\n\nJenkins grinned as he started back for that castle of terror which he'd\njust quitted. He blinked in surprise when he saw that the drawbridge had\nbeen lowered. The dwarfs and the giants were apparently expected, but\nthey would certainly be amazed to see him.\n\n\"You!\" Lucretia exclaimed when she saw him. \"How did you escape?\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders and stared coldly into her beautiful eyes. She\nfrowned back at him, then turned and motioned for her men to follow.\nTheir way was lit by torchbearers, and led up a winding path which ended\non a level bit of highland directly behind the castle. Here was grass\nland smooth as velvet; here were the grounds of combat, bloodless but\njust as decisive.\n\nThere was a single alley, at the far end of which stood ten pins.\nJenkins measured the alley with his eyes and figured it to be just about\nthe length of a conventional bowling alley. The backstop was built up of\nearth and was soft enough so that the pins would not splinter on\nstriking it.\n\n\"We all know the rules,\" Lucretia said. \"To the victor goes the rule of\nour land. To the loser, slavery. Therefore, let us begin. Since I hold\ntitle, I choose to have my champion bowl last.\"\n\n\n\nThe giant's man bowled first against Loti. Just as Lucretia had said, he\nhad speed but that was all. Loti had a much slower ball, but one that\nknocked down more pins on his hits. The giant got too many splits and\nrailroads to be able to beat the little man.\n\nThen, after a short wait, Griffin took the alley against Loti. And from\nthe first ball, Jenkins saw that the little man stood no chance.\nGriffin's hook worked beautifully on the velvet grass lawn. He literally\nswamped Loti, whose shoulders slumped in weariness and discouragement as\nGriffin struck out.\n\n\"And so we remain slaves once more,\" Loti said, as the pin setter set up\nthe last rack. \"Once, when the man called Rip Van Winkle bowled, I\nthought we had a chance. But she got him drunk and we lost that match.\nNow this.\"\n\nLucretia was elated. As the last strike scattered the pins, she ran up\nto Griffin and planted a kiss on his lips.\n\n\"My champion!\" she crowed. \"Now we will take care of these big and\nlittle creatures once and for all. Once I was generous. Now I will be\notherwise.\"\n\n\"Maybe!\" Jenkins suddenly spoke. \"But we're not through bowling. I am\nnow of the people here, and I challenge the winner of the two matches.\"\n\nLoti caught up the other's words:\n\n\"He speaks true. He has the right to challenge.\"\n\n\"Is it true,\" Jenkins asked, \"that the winner has the right to give\nterms?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" Loti said.\n\n\"Then let's bowl,\" Jenkins said.\n\nHe tried the grip of the ball Loti passed to him. It was a two-fingered\ngrip, and just a little small. As the challenger, Jenkins had to bowl\nfirst. He measured the distance carefully, tried to figure the angle\ninto the pocket, took a three-step run and let his ball go in a medium\nswing. The ball hooked in neatly, and left a four-seven split. A laugh\narose from Lucretia's followers. But silence fell among them as Jenkins\nmade the pickup.\n\n\"Nice shot, copper,\" Griffin said, as he stepped up to bowl, and made a\nstrike. From then on, they matched strikes to the eighth frame when\nGriffin hit the head pin directly and got a seven-ten railroad. He\npicked up the ten-pin. Jenkins had gotten a nine count and made the\nspare.\n\n\n\nIn the ninth frame, Jenkins struck. Griffin stepped up, wiped his right\nhand carefully against the trousers he had donned, took aim with great\ncare, and sent the ball down the side of the alley. It hooked in nicely\nand again hit the head pin directly, only this time the six, ten, four\nand seven pins were left standing. So badly shot was he by the bad\nbreak, that he fumbled the ball as he started for his second shot. But\nhe recovered quickly and neatly made the spare, the four pin barely\ngrazing the ten.\n\nThe score as they started the tenth frame was 206 for Griffin and 209\nfor Jenkins.\n\nJenkins knew he had to mark at the least to win, and a double to make it\nclose if Griffin got a double. Minutes went by while Jenkins made his\nlast sight. Then he took three quick steps and let the ball go. But just\nas he reached the foul line, Jenkins slipped. The grass had become slick\nwith all the running being done on its surface. And the ball, instead of\nhooking, went straight in, and left a very bad railroad, the four-ten.\n\nGriffin's sigh of relief was the only sound to break the silence, as\nJenkins stepped up for his second shot. He knew there was but one chance\nto make it, one chance alone.\n\nIf he could but get the ball over just right, it could make the four\nslide over against the ten.\n\nThunderous roars rent the air, and piping screams of delight, as the\ngiants and the dwarfs saw the dreaded four-ten split made! The strike\nJenkins hit for his last shot was an anti-climax. The score stood at 249\nfor Jenkins.\n\n\"Nice shot,\" Griffin said as he stepped up. \"But all I need is a\ndouble.\" He threw, and the ten pins fell. His second ball was also a\nstrike.\n\n\"And just to show you how good I am,\" Griffin declared, as he held the\nball for the last throw, \"I'm going to make just four pins so you won't\nfeel too bad.\"\n\nOnly he didn't! For what had happened to Jenkins, happened to him. His\nfoot also slipped on the grass, and this time he got three pins. The\nscore was tied.\n\nSuddenly Jenkins sat down, removed his shoes and stood erect. He wasn't\ngoing to take a chance on his last ball, for that was the rule on a tie.\nOne ball until the tie was broken, and a strike was just a strike. There\nwas no question of what Jenkins threw the instant he released the ball.\nRight in the pocket!\n\nGriffin's ball left the hard one, the ten pin. Griffin was still\nstooped, his hands on his hips and his face forlorn, when Jenkins' hand\nfell on his shoulder.\n\n\"I said I was taking you in, Griffin,\" Jenkins said. \"And come hell or\nhigh water, I'm going to.\"\n\nGriffin shrugged the hand off as he whirled on the other. \"Don't be a\nfool!\" he spat. \"Do you think we're alive?\"\n\n\"Rip Van Winkle was,\" Jenkins said, cryptically. \"And I think we are,\ntoo.\"\n\n\"He is quite right, my friend,\" Loti said, as he stepped up to them. \"I\ncan send you back, both of you, back to the time and place of your\nleavetaking. This instant....\"\n\n\n\nJenkins felt a wave of blackness wash over him, a terrible wrenching at\nhis innards, and a sudden thrust. He opened his eyes and looked about.\nThere was a pain in his left shoulder, and he could feel a sticky\nwetness running down his arm. Griffin stood before him, and in Griffin's\neyes was a dazed look. Behind Griffin, the door to the pilot's cabin\nswung crazily. Before Griffin knew what hit him, Jenkins had leaped upon\nhim. It took one blow, a terrific hook to the man's jaw, and Griffin\nslumped to the floor.\n\n\"What happened?\" Jenkins asked as the stewardess bandaged his shoulder\nwhere Griffin's shot had caught him.\n\n\"Why,\" she said, \"he shot, you went backward. Then, and it's the only\nway I can describe it, you both seemed to freeze up for an instant. The\nnext thing I knew, you had recovered and the fight was over.\"\n\nBut Jenkins knew better. He knew that in those few seconds, space and\ntime had changed for himself and Griffin, and it was a lucky bowling\nmatch which had brought them back.",
