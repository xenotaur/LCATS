    "body": "For over forty years, in one part of the world or another, old man\nMarshall had, served his country as a United States consul. He had been\nappointed by Lincoln. For a quarter of a century that fact was his\ndistinction. It was now his epitaph. But in former years, as each new\nadministration succeeded the old, it had again and again saved his\nofficial head. When victorious and voracious place-hunters, searching\nthe map of the world for spoils, dug out his hiding-place and demanded\nhis consular sign as a reward for a younger and more aggressive party\nworker, the ghost of the dead President protected him. In the State\nDepartment, Marshall had become a tradition. \u201cYou can\u2019t touch Him!\u201d the\nState Department would say; \u201cwhy, HE was appointed by Lincoln!\u201d\nSecretly, for this weapon against the hungry headhunters, the\ndepartment was infinitely grateful. Old man Marshall was a consul after\nits own heart. Like a soldier, he was obedient, disciplined; wherever\nhe was sent, there, without question, he would go. Never against exile,\nagainst ill-health, against climate did he make complaint. Nor when he\nwas moved on and down to make way for some ne\u2019er-do-well with\ninfluence, with a brother-in-law in the Senate, with a cousin owning a\nnewspaper, with rich relatives who desired him to drink himself to\ndeath at the expense of the government rather than at their own, did\nold man Marshall point to his record as a claim for more just\ntreatment.\n\nAnd it had been an excellent record. His official reports, in a quaint,\nstately hand, were models of English; full of information, intelligent,\nvaluable, well observed. And those few of his countrymen, who stumbled\nupon him in the out-of-the-world places to which of late he had been\nbanished, wrote of him to the department in terms of admiration and\nawe. Never had he or his friends petitioned for promotion, until it was\nat last apparent that, save for his record and the memory of his dead\npatron, he had no friends. But, still in the department the tradition\nheld and, though he was not advanced, he was not dismissed.\n\n\u201cIf that old man\u2019s been feeding from the public trough ever since the\nCivil War,\u201d protested a \u201cpractical\u201d politician, \u201cit seems to me, Mr.\nSecretary, that he\u2019s about had his share. Ain\u2019t it time he give some\none else a bite? Some of us that has, done the work, that has borne the\nbrunt\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThis place he now holds,\u201d interrupted the Secretary of State suavely,\n\u201cis one hardly commensurate with services like yours. I can\u2019t pronounce\nthe name of it, and I\u2019m not sure just where it is, but I see that, of\nthe last six consuls we sent there, three resigned within a month and\nthe other three died of yellow-fever. Still, if you insist\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nThe practical politician reconsidered hastily. \u201cI\u2019m not the sort,\u201d he\nprotested, \u201cto turn out a man appointed by our martyred President.\nBesides, he\u2019s so old now, if the fever don\u2019t catch him, he\u2019ll die of\nold age, anyway.\u201d\n\nThe Secretary coughed uncomfortably. \u201cAnd they say,\u201d he murmured,\n\u201crepublics are ungrateful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t quite get that,\u201d said the practical politician.\n\nOf Porto Banos, of the Republic of Colombia, where as consul Mr.\nMarshall was upholding the dignity of the United States, little could\nbe said except that it possessed a sure harbor. When driven from the\nCaribbean Sea by stress of weather, the largest of ocean tramps, and\neven battle-ships, could find in its protecting arms of coral a safe\nshelter. But, as young Mr. Aiken, the wireless operator, pointed out,\nunless driven by a hurricane and the fear of death, no one ever visited\nit. Back of the ancient wharfs, that dated from the days when Porto\nBanos was a receiver of stolen goods for buccaneers and pirates, were\nrows of thatched huts, streets, according to the season, of dust or\nmud, a few iron-barred, jail-like barracks, customhouses, municipal\nbuildings, and the whitewashed adobe houses of the consuls. The\nbackyard of the town was a swamp. Through this at five each morning a\nrusty engine pulled a train of flat cars to the base of the mountains,\nand, if meanwhile the rails had not disappeared into the swamp, at five\nin the evening brought back the flat cars laden with odorous\ncoffee-sacks.\n\nIn the daily life of Porto Banos, waiting for the return of the train,\nand betting if it would return, was the chief interest. Each night the\nconsuls, the foreign residents, the wireless operator, the manager of\nthe rusty railroad met for dinner. There at the head of the long table,\nby virtue of his years, of his courtesy and distinguished manner, of\nhis office, Mr. Marshall presided. Of the little band of exiles he was\nthe chosen ruler. His rule was gentle. By force of example he had made\nexistence in Porto Banos more possible. For women and children Porto\nBanos was a death-trap, and before \u201cold man Marshall\u201d came there had\nbeen no influence to remind the enforced bachelors of other days.\n\nThey had lost interest, had grown lax, irritable, morose. Their white\nduck was seldom white. Their cheeks were unshaven. When the sun sank\ninto the swamp and the heat still turned Porto Banos into a Turkish\nbath, they threw dice on the greasy tables of the Caf\u00e9 Bolivar for\ndrinks. The petty gambling led to petty quarrels; the drinks to fever.\nThe coming of Mr. Marshall changed that. His standard of life, his\ntact, his worldly wisdom, his cheerful courtesy, his fastidious\npersonal neatness shamed the younger men; the desire to please him, to,\nstand well in his good opinion, brought back pride and self-esteem.\n\nThe lieutenant of her Majesty\u2019s gun-boat _Plover_ noted the change.\n\n\u201cUsed to be,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cyou couldn\u2019t get out of the Caf\u00e9 Bolivar\nwithout some one sticking a knife in you; now it\u2019s a debating club.\nThey all sit round a table and listen to an old gentleman talk world\npolitics.\u201d\n\nIf Henry Marshall brought content to the exiles of Porto Banos, there\nwas little in return that Porto Banos could give to him. Magazines and\ncorrespondents in six languages kept him in touch with those foreign\nlands in which he had represented his country, but of the country he\nhad represented, newspapers and periodicals showed him only too clearly\nthat in forty years it had grown away from him, had changed beyond\nrecognition.\n\nWhen last he had called at the State Department, he had been made to\nfeel he was a man without a country, and when he visited his home town\nin Vermont, he was looked upon as a Rip Van Winkle. Those of his\nboyhood friends who were not dead had long thought of him as dead. And\nthe sleepy, pretty village had become a bustling commercial centre. In\nthe lanes where, as a young man, he had walked among wheatfields,\ntrolley-cars whirled between rows of mills and factories. The children\nhad grown to manhood, with children of their own.\n\nLike a ghost, he searched for house after house, where once he had been\nmade welcome, only to find in its place a towering office building.\n\u201cAll had gone, the old familiar faces.\u201d In vain he scanned even the\nshop fronts for a friendly, homelike name. Whether the fault was his,\nwhether he would better have served his own interests than those of his\ngovernment, it now was too late to determine. In his own home, he was a\nstranger among strangers. In the service he had so faithfully followed,\nrank by rank, he had been dropped, until now he, who twice had been a\nconsul-general, was an exile, banished to a fever swamp. The great Ship\nof State had dropped him overside, had \u201cmarooned\u201d him, and sailed away.\n\nTwice a day he walked along the shell road to the Caf\u00e9 Bolivar, and\nback again to the consulate. There, as he entered the outer office,\nJos\u00e9, the Colombian clerk, would rise and bow profoundly.\n\n\u201cAny papers for me to sign, Jos\u00e9?\u201d the consul would ask.\n\n\u201cNot to-day, Excellency,\u201d the clerk would reply. Then Jos\u00e9 would return\nto writing a letter to his lady-love; not that there was any-thing to\ntell her, but because writing on the official paper of the consulate\ngave him importance in his eyes, and in hers. And in the inner office\nthe consul would continue to gaze at the empty harbor, the empty coral\nreefs, the empty, burning sky.\n\nThe little band of exiles were at second break fast when the wireless\nman came in late to announce that a Red D. boat and the island of\nCura\u00e7ao had both reported a hurricane coming north. Also, that much\nconcern was felt for the safety of the yacht _Serapis_. Three days\nbefore, in advance of her coming, she had sent a wireless to\nWilhelmstad, asking the captain of the port to reserve a berth for her.\nShe expected to arrive the following morning.\n\nBut for forty-eight hours nothing had been heard from her, and it was\nbelieved she had been overhauled by the hurricane. Owing to the\npresence on board of Senator Hanley, the closest friend of the new\nPresident, the man who had made him president, much concern was felt at\nWashington. To try to pick her up by wireless, the gun-boat _Newark_\nhad been ordered from Culebra, the cruiser _Raleigh_, with Admiral\nHardy on board, from Colon. It was possible she would seek shelter at\nPorto Banos. The consul was ordered to report.\n\nAs Marshall wrote out his answer, the French consul exclaimed with\ninterest:\n\n\u201cHe is of importance, then, this senator?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs it that in\nyour country ships of war are at the service of a senator?\u201d\n\nAiken, the wireless operator, grinned derisively.\n\n\u201cAt the service of _this_ senator, they are!\u201d he answered. \u201cThey call\nhim the \u2018king-maker,\u2019 the man behind the throne.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut in your country,\u201d protested the Frenchman, \u201cthere is no throne. I\nthought your president was elected by the people?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the people think,\u201d answered Aiken. \u201cIn God\u2019s country,\u201d he\nexplained, \u201cthe trusts want a rich man in the Senate, with the same\ninterests as their own, to represent them. They chose Hanley. He picked\nout of the candidates for the presidency the man he thought would help\nthe interests. He nominated him, and the people voted for him. Hanley\nis what we call a \u2018boss.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Frenchman looked inquiringly at Marshall.\n\n\u201cThe position of the boss is the more dangerous,\u201d said Marshall\ngravely, \u201cbecause it is unofficial, because there are no laws to\ncurtail his powers. Men like Senator Hanley are a menace to good\ngovernment. They see in public office only a reward for party workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d assented Aiken. \u201cYour forty years\u2019 service, Mr. Consul,\nwouldn\u2019t count with Hanley. If he wanted your job, he\u2019d throw you out\nas quick as he would a drunken cook.\u201d\n\nMr. Marshall flushed painfully, and the French consul hastened to\ninterrupt.\n\n\u201cThen, let us pray,\u201d he exclaimed, with fervor, \u201cthat the hurricane has\nsunk the _Serapis_, and all on board.\u201d\n\nTwo hours later, the _Serapis_, showing she had met the hurricane and\nhad come out second best, steamed into the harbor.\n\nHer owner was young Herbert Livingstone, of Washington. He once had\nbeen in the diplomatic service, and, as minister to The Hague, wished\nto return to it. In order to bring this about he had subscribed\nliberally to the party campaign fund.\n\nWith him, among other distinguished persons, was the all-powerful\nHanley. The kidnapping of Hanley for the cruise, in itself,\ndemonstrated the ability of Livingstone as a diplomat. It was the\nopinion of many that it would surely lead to his appointment as a\nminister plenipotentiary. Livingstone was of the same opinion. He had\nnot lived long in the nation\u2019s capital without observing the value of\npropinquity. How many men he knew were now paymasters, and secretaries\nof legation, solely because those high in the government met them daily\nat the Metropolitan Club, and preferred them in almost any other place.\nAnd if, after three weeks as his guest on board what the newspapers\ncalled his floating palace, the senator could refuse him even the\nprize, legation of Europe, there was no value in modest merit. As yet,\nLivingstone had not hinted at his ambition. There was no need. To a\nstatesman of Hanley\u2019s astuteness, the largeness of Livingstone\u2019s\ncontribution to the campaign fund was self-explanatory.\n\nAfter her wrestling-match with the hurricane, all those on board the\n_Serapis_ seemed to find in land, even in the swamp land of Porto\nBanos, a compelling attraction. Before the anchors hit the water, they\nwere in the launch. On reaching shore, they made at once for the\nconsulate. There were many cables they wished to start on their way by\nwireless; cables to friends, to newspapers, to the government.\n\nJos\u00e9, the Colombian clerk, appalled by the unprecedented invasion of\nvisitors, of visitors so distinguished, and Marshall, grateful for a\nchance to serve his fellow-countrymen, and especially his countrywomen,\nwere ubiquitous, eager, indispensable. At Jos\u00e9\u2019s desk the great\nsenator, rolling his cigar between his teeth, was using, to Jos\u00e9\u2019s\necstasy, Jos\u00e9\u2019s own pen to write a reassuring message to the White\nHouse. At the consul\u2019s desk a beautiful creature, all in lace and\npearls, was struggling to compress the very low opinion she held of a\nhurricane into ten words. On his knee, Henry Cairns, the banker, was\ninditing instructions to his Wall Street office, and upon himself\nLivingstone had taken the responsibility of replying to the inquiries\nheaped upon Marshall\u2019s desk, from many newspapers.\n\nIt was just before sunset, and Marshall produced his tea things, and\nthe young person in pearls and lace, who was Miss Cairns, made tea for\nthe women, and the men mixed gin and limes with tepid water. The consul\napologized for proposing a toast in which they could not join. He\nbegged to drink to those who had escaped the perils of the sea. Had\nthey been his oldest and nearest friends, his little speech could not\nhave been more heart-felt and sincere. To his distress, it moved one of\nthe ladies to tears, and in embarrassment he turned to the men.\n\n\u201cI regret there is no ice,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you know the rule of the\ntropics; as soon as a ship enters port, the ice-machine bursts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell the steward to send you some, sir,\u201d said Livingstone, \u201cand\nas long as we\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nThe senator showed his concern.\n\n\u201cAs long as we\u2019re here?\u201d he gasped.\n\n\u201cNot over two days,\u201d answered the owner nervously. \u201cThe chief says it\nwill take all of that to get her in shape. As you ought to know,\nSenator, she was pretty badly mauled.\u201d\n\nThe senator gazed blankly out of the window. Beyond it lay the naked\ncoral reefs, the empty sky, and the ragged palms of Porto Banos.\n\nLivingstone felt that his legation was slipping from him.\n\n\u201cThat wireless operator,\u201d he continued hastily, \u201ctells me there is a\nmost amusing place a few miles down the coast, Las Bocas, a sort of\nConey Island, where the government people go for the summer. There\u2019s\nsurf bathing and roulette and cafes chantants. He says there\u2019s some\nSpanish dancers\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nThe guests of the _Serapis_ exclaimed with interest; the senator\nsmiled. To Marshall the general enthusiasm over the thought of a ride\non a merry-go-round suggested that the friends of Mr. Livingstone had\nfound their own society far from satisfying.\n\nGreatly encouraged, Livingstone continued, with enthusiasm:\n\n\u201cAnd that wireless man said,\u201d he added, \u201cthat with the launch we can\nget there in half an hour. We might run down after dinner.\u201d He turned\nto Marshall.\n\n\u201cWill you join us, Mr. Consul?\u201d he asked, \u201cand dine with us, first?\u201d\n\nMarshall accepted with genuine pleasure. It had been many months since\nhe had sat at table with his own people. But he shook his head\ndoubtfully.\n\n\u201cI was wondering about Las Bocas,\u201d he explained, \u201cif your going there\nmight not get you in trouble at the next port. With a yacht, I think it\nis different, but Las Bocas is under quarantine.\u201d\n\nThere was a chorus of exclamations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not serious,\u201d Marshall explained. \u201cThere was bubonic plague\nthere, or something like it. You would be in no danger from that. It is\nonly that you might be held up by the regulations. Passenger steamers\ncan\u2019t land any one who has been there at any other port of the West\nIndies. The English are especially strict. The Royal Mail won\u2019t even\nreceive any one on board here without a certificate from the English\nconsul saying he has not visited Las Bocas. For an American they would\nrequire the same guarantee from me. But I don\u2019t think the regulations\nextend to yachts. I will inquire. I don\u2019t wish to deprive you of any of\nthe many pleasures of Porto Banos,\u201d he added, smiling, \u201cbut if you were\nrefused a landing at your next port I would blame myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d declared Livingstone decidedly. \u201cIt\u2019s just as you\nsay; yachts and warships are exempt. Besides, I carry my own doctor,\nand if he won\u2019t give us a clean bill of health, I\u2019ll make him walk the\nplank. At eight, then, at dinner. I\u2019ll send the cutter for you. I can\u2019t\ngive you a salute, Mr. Consul, but you shall have all the side boys I\ncan muster.\u201d\n\nThose from the yacht parted from their consul in the most friendly\nspirit.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s charming!\u201d exclaimed Miss Cairns. \u201cAnd did you notice his\nnovels? They were in every language. It must be terribly lonely down\nhere, for a man like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the first of our consuls we\u2019ve met on this trip,\u201d growled her\nfather, \u201cthat we\u2019ve caught sober.\u201d\n\n\u201cSober!\u201d exclaimed his wife indignantly.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the Marshalls of Vermont. I asked him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wonder,\u201d mused Hanley, \u201chow much the place is worth? Hamilton, one\nof the new senators, has been deviling the life out of me to send his\nson somewhere. Says if he stays in Washington he\u2019ll disgrace the\nfamily. I should think this place would drive any man to drink himself\nto death in three months, and young Hamilton, from what I\u2019ve seen of\nhim, ought to be able to do it in a week. That would leave the place\nopen for the next man.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a postmaster in my State thinks he carried it.\u201d The senator\nsmiled grimly. \u201cHe has consumption, and wants us to give him a\nconsulship in the tropics. I\u2019ll tell him I\u2019ve seen Porto Banos, and\nthat it\u2019s just the place for him.\u201d\n\nThe senator\u2019s pleasantry was not well received. But Miss Cairns alone\nhad the temerity to speak of what the others were thinking.\n\n\u201cWhat would become of Mr. Marshall?\u201d she asked. The senator smiled\ntolerantly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that I was thinking of Mr. Marshall,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t\nrecall anything he has done for this administration. You see, Miss\nCairns,\u201d he explained, in the tone of one addressing a small child,\n\u201cMarshall has been abroad now for forty years, at the expense of the\ntaxpayers. Some of us think men who have lived that long on their\nfellow-countrymen had better come home and get to work.\u201d\n\nLivingstone nodded solemnly in assent. He did not wish a post abroad at\nthe expense of the taxpayers. He was willing to pay for it. And then,\nwith \u201cex-Minister\u201d on his visiting cards, and a sense of duty well\nperformed, for the rest of his life he could join the other expatriates\nin Paris.\n\nJust before dinner, the cruiser _Raleigh_ having discovered the\nwhereabouts of the _Serapis_ by wireless, entered the harbor, and\nAdmiral Hardy came to the yacht to call upon the senator, in whose\nbehalf he had been scouring the Caribbean Seas. Having paid his\nrespects to that personage, the admiral fell boisterously upon\nMarshall.\n\nThe two old gentlemen were friends of many years. They had met,\nofficially and unofficially, in many strange parts of the world. To\neach the chance reunion was a piece of tremendous good fortune. And\nthroughout dinner the guests of Livingstone, already bored with each\nother, found in them and their talk of former days new and delightful\nentertainment. So much so that when, Marshall having assured them that\nthe local quarantine regulations did not extend to a yacht, the men\ndeparted for Las Bocas, the women insisted that he and admiral remain\nbehind.\n\nIt was for Marshall a wondrous evening. To foregather with his old\nfriend whom he had known since Hardy was a mad midshipman, to sit at\nthe feet of his own charming countrywomen, to listen to their soft,\nmodulated laughter, to note how quickly they saw that to him the\nevening was a great event, and with what tact each contributed to make\nit the more memorable; all served to wipe out the months of bitter\nloneliness, the stigma of failure, the sense of undeserved neglect. In\nthe moonlight, on the cool quarter-deck, they sat, in a half-circle,\neach of the two friends telling tales out of school, tales of which the\nother was the hero or the victim, \u201cinside\u201d stories of great occasions,\nceremonies, bombardments, unrecorded \u201cshirt-sleeve\u201d diplomacy.\n\nHardy had helped to open the Suez Canal. Marshall had assisted the\nQueen of Madagascar to escape from the French invaders. On the Barbary\nCoast Hardy had chased pirates. In Edinburgh Marshall had played chess\nwith Carlyle. He had seen Paris in mourning in the days of the siege,\nParis in terror in the days of the Commune; he had known Garibaldi,\nGambetta, the younger Dumas, the creator of Pickwick.\n\n\u201cDo you remember that time in Tangier,\u201d the admiral urged, \u201cwhen I was\na midshipman, and got into the bashaw\u2019s harem?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you remember how I got you out?\u201d Marshall replied grimly.\n\n\u201cAnd,\u201d demanded Hardy, \u201cdo you remember when Adelina Patti paid a visit\nto the _Kearsarge_ at Marseilles in \u201965\u2014George Dewey was our second\nofficer\u2014and you were bowing and backing away from her, and you backed\ninto an open hatch, and she said \u2018my French isn\u2019t up to it\u2019 what was it\nshe said?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear it,\u201d said Marshall; \u201cI was too far down the hatch.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean the old _Kearsarge?_\u201d asked Mrs. Cairns. \u201cWere you in the\nservice then, Mr. Marshall?\u201d\n\nWith loyal pride in his friend, the admiral answered for him:\n\n\u201cHe was our consul-general at Marseilles!\u201d\n\nThere was an uncomfortable moment. Even those denied imagination could\nnot escape the contrast, could see in their mind\u2019s eye the great harbor\nof Marseilles, crowded with the shipping of the world, surrounding it\nthe beautiful city, the rival of Paris to the north, and on the\nbattleship the young consul-general making his bow to the young Empress\nof Song. And now, before their actual eyes, they saw the village of\nPorto Banos, a black streak in the night, a row of mud shacks, at the\nend of the wharf a single lantern yellow in the clear moonlight.\n\nLater in the evening Miss Cairns led the admiral to one side.\n\n\u201cAdmiral,\u201d she began eagerly, \u201ctell me about your friend. Why is he\nhere? Why don\u2019t they give him a place worthy of him? I\u2019ve seen many of\nour representatives abroad, and I know we cannot afford to waste men\nlike that.\u201d The girl exclaimed indignantly: \u201cHe\u2019s one of the most\ninteresting men I\u2019ve ever met! He\u2019s lived everywhere, known every one.\nHe\u2019s a distinguished man, a cultivated man; even I can see he knows his\nwork, that he\u2019s a diplomat, born, trained, that he\u2019s\u2014\u2014\u201d The admiral\ninterrupted with a growl.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell ME about Henry,\u201d he protested. \u201cI\u2019ve known\nHenry twenty-five years. If Henry got his deserts,\u201d he exclaimed hotly,\n\u201che wouldn\u2019t be a consul on this coral reef; he\u2019d be a minister in\nEurope. Look at me! We\u2019re the same age. We started together. When\nLincoln sent him to Morocco as consul, he signed my commission as a\nmidshipman. Now I\u2019m an admiral. Henry has twice my brains and he\u2019s been\na consul-general, and he\u2019s _here_, back at the foot of the ladder!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d demanded the girl.\n\n\u201cBecause the navy is a service and the consular service isn\u2019t a\nservice. Men like Senator Hanley use it to pay their debts. While\nHenry\u2019s been serving his country abroad, he\u2019s lost his friends, lost\nhis \u2018pull.\u2019 Those politicians up at Washington have no use for him.\nThey don\u2019t consider that a consul like Henry can make a million dollars\nfor his countrymen. He can keep them from shipping goods where there\u2019s\nno market, show them where there is a market.\u201d The admiral snorted\ncontemptuously. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell ME the value of a good consul.\nBut those politicians don\u2019t consider that. They only see that he has a\njob worth a few hundred dollars, and they want it, and if he hasn\u2019t\nother politicians to protect him, they\u2019ll take it.\u201d The girl raised her\nhead.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you speak to the senator?\u201d she asked. \u201cTell him you\u2019ve known\nhim for years, that\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGlad to do it!\u201d exclaimed the admiral heartily. \u201cIt won\u2019t be the first\ntime. But Henry mustn\u2019t know. He\u2019s too confoundedly touchy. He hates\nthe _idea_ of influence, hates men like Hanley, who abuse it. If he\nthought anything was given to him except on his merits, he wouldn\u2019t\ntake it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we won\u2019t tell him,\u201d said the girl. For a moment she hesitated.\n\n\u201cIf I spoke to Mr. Hanley,\u201d she asked, \u201ctold him what I learned\nto-night of Mr. Marshall, would it have any effect?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know how it will affect Hanley,\u201d said the sailor, \u201cbut if you\nasked _me_ to make anybody a consul-general, I\u2019d make him an\nambassador.\u201d\n\nLater in the evening Hanley and Livingstone were seated alone on deck.\nThe visit to Las Bocas had not proved amusing, but, much to\nLivingstone\u2019s relief, his honored guest was now in good-humor. He took\nhis cigar from his lips, only to sip at a long cool drink. He was in a\nmood flatteringly confidential and communicative.\n\n\u201cPeople have the strangest idea of what I can do for them,\u201d he laughed.\nIt was his pose to pretend he was without authority. \u201cThey believe I\u2019ve\nonly to wave a wand, and get them anything they want. I thought I\u2019d be\nsafe from them on board a yacht.\u201d\n\nLivingstone, in ignorance of what was coming, squirmed apprehensively.\n\n\u201cBut it seems,\u201d the senator went on, \u201cI\u2019m at the mercy of a conspiracy.\nThe women folk want me to do something for this fellow Marshall. If\nthey had their way, they\u2019d send him to the Court of St. James. And old\nHardy, too, tackled me about him. So did Miss Cairns. And then Marshall\nhimself got me behind the wheel-house, and I thought he was going to\ntell me how good he was, too! But he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAs though the joke were on himself, the senator laughed appreciatively.\n\n\u201cTold me, instead, that Hardy ought to be a vice-admiral.\u201d\n\nLivingstone, also, laughed, with the satisfied air of one who cannot be\ntricked.\n\n\u201cThey fixed it up between them,\u201d he explained, \u201ceach was to put in a\ngood word for the other.\u201d He nodded eagerly. \u201cThat\u2019s what _I_ think.\u201d\n\nThere were moments during the cruise when Senator Hanley would have\nfound relief in dropping his host overboard. With mock deference, the\nolder man inclined his head.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what _you_ think, is it?\u201d he asked. \u201cLivingstone,\u201d he added,\n\u201cyou certainly are a great judge of men!\u201d\n\nThe next morning, old man Marshall woke with a lightness at his heart\nthat had been long absent. For a moment, conscious only that he was\nhappy, he lay between sleep and waking, frowning up at his canopy of\nmosquito net, trying to realize what change had come to him. Then he\nremembered. His old friend had returned. New friends had come into his\nlife and welcomed him kindly. He was no longer lonely. As eager as a\nboy, he ran to the window. He had not been dreaming. In the harbor lay\nthe pretty yacht, the stately, white-hulled war-ship. The flag that\ndrooped from the stern of each caused his throat to tighten, brought\nwarm tears to his eyes, fresh resolve to his discouraged, troubled\nspirit. When he knelt beside his bed, his heart poured out his thanks\nin gratitude and gladness.\n\nWhile he was dressing, a blue-jacket brought a note from the admiral.\nIt invited him to tea on board the war-ship, with the guests of the\n_Serapis_. His old friend added that he was coming to lunch with his\nconsul, and wanted time reserved for a long talk. The consul agreed\ngladly. He was in holiday humor. The day promised to repeat the good\nmoments of the night previous.\n\nAt nine o\u2019clock, through the open door of the consulate, Marshall saw\nAiken, the wireless operator, signaling from the wharf excitedly to the\nyacht, and a boat leave the ship and return. Almost immediately the\nlaunch, carrying several passengers, again made the trip shoreward.\n\nHalf an hour later, Senator Hanley, Miss Cairns, and Livingstone came\nup the waterfront, and entering the consulate, seated themselves around\nMarshall\u2019s desk. Livingstone was sunk in melancholy. The senator, on\nthe contrary, was smiling broadly. His manner was one of distinct\nrelief. He greeted the consul with hearty good-humor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ordered home!\u201d he announced gleefully. Then, remembering the\npresence of Livingstone, he hastened to add: \u201cI needn\u2019t say how sorry I\nam to give up my yachting trip, but orders are orders. The President,\u201d\nhe explained to Marshall, \u201ccables me this morning to come back and take\nmy coat off.\u201d The prospect, as a change from playing bridge on a\npleasure boat, seemed far from depressing him.\n\n\u201cThose filibusters in the Senate,\u201d he continued genially, \u201care making\ntrouble again. They think they\u2019ve got me out of the way for another\nmonth, but they\u2019ll find they\u2019re wrong. When that bill comes up, they\u2019ll\nfind me at the old stand and ready for business!\u201d Marshall did not\nattempt to conceal his personal disappointment.\n\n\u201cI am so sorry you are leaving,\u201d he said; \u201cselfishly sorry, I mean. I\u2019d\nhoped you all would be here for several days.\u201d He looked inquiringly\ntoward Livingstone.\n\n\u201cI understood the _Serapis_ was disabled,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cShe is,\u201d answered Hanley. \u201cSo\u2019s the _Raleigh_. At a pinch, the admiral\nmight have stretched the regulations and carried me to Jamaica, but the\n_Raleigh\u2019s_ engines are knocked about too. I\u2019ve GOT to reach Kingston\nThursday. The German boat leaves there Thursday for New York. At first\nit looked as though I couldn\u2019t do it, but we find that the Royal Mail\nis due to-day, and she can get to Kingston Wednesday night. It\u2019s a\ngreat piece of luck. I wouldn\u2019t bother you with my troubles,\u201d the\nsenator explained pleasantly, \u201cbut the agent of the Royal Mail here\nwon\u2019t sell me a ticket until you\u2019ve put your seal to this.\u201d He extended\na piece of printed paper.\n\nAs Hanley had been talking, the face of the consul had grown grave. He\naccepted the paper, but did not look at it. Instead, he regarded the\nsenator with troubled eyes. When he spoke, his tone was one of genuine\nconcern.\n\n\u201cIt is most unfortunate,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am afraid the _Royal Mail_\nwill not take you on board. Because of Las Bocas,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf we\nhad only known!\u201d he added remorsefully. \u201cIt is _most_ unfortunate.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of Las Bocas?\u201d echoed Hanley.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean they\u2019ll refuse to take me to Jamaica because I spent\nhalf an hour at the end of a wharf listening to a squeaky gramophone?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe trouble,\u201d explained Marshall, \u201cis this: if they carried you, all\nthe other passengers would be held in quarantine for ten days, and\nthere are fines to pay, and there would be difficulties over the mails.\nBut,\u201d he added hopefully, \u201cmaybe the regulations have been altered. I\nwill see her captain, and tell him\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSee her captain!\u201d objected Hanley. \u201cWhy see the captain? He doesn\u2019t\nknow I\u2019ve been to that place. Why tell _him?_ All I need is a clean\nbill of health from you. That\u2019s all HE wants. You have only to sign\nthat paper.\u201d Marshall regarded the senator with surprise.\n\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t? Why not?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it certifies to the fact that you have not visited Las Bocas.\nUnfortunately, you have visited Las Bocas.\u201d\n\nThe senator had been walking up and down the room. Now he seated\nhimself, and stared at Marshall curiously.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like this, Mr. Marshall,\u201d he began quietly. \u201cThe President\ndesires my presence in Washington, thinks I can be of some use to him\nthere in helping carry out certain party measures\u2014measures to which he\npledged himself before his election. Down here, a British steamship\nline has laid down local rules which, in my case anyway, are\nridiculous. The question is, are you going to be bound by the red tape\nof a ha\u2019penny British colony, or by your oath to the President of the\nUnited States?\u201d\n\nThe sophistry amused Marshall. He smiled good-naturedly and shook his\nhead.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid, Senator,\u201d he said, \u201cthat way of putting it is hardly fair.\nUnfortunately, the question is one of fact. I will explain to the\ncaptain\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will explain nothing to the captain!\u201d interrupted Hanley. \u201cThis is\na matter which concerns no one but our two selves. I am not asking\nfavors of steamboat captains. I am asking an American consul to assist\nan American citizen in trouble, and,\u201d he added, with heavy sarcasm,\n\u201cincidentally, to carry out the wishes of his President.\u201d\n\nMarshall regarded the senator with an expression of both surprise and\ndisbelief.\n\n\u201cAre you asking me to put my name to what is not so?\u201d he said. \u201cAre you\nserious?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat paper, Mr. Marshall,\u201d returned Hanley steadily, \u201cis a mere form,\na piece of red tape. There\u2019s no more danger of my carrying the plague\nto Jamaica than of my carrying a dynamite bomb. You _know_ that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI _do_ know that,\u201d assented Marshall heartily. \u201cI appreciate your\nposition, and I regret it exceedingly. You are the innocent victim of a\nregulation which is a wise regulation, but which is most unfair to you.\nMy own position,\u201d he added, \u201cis not important, but you can believe me,\nit is not easy. It is certainly no pleasure for me to be unable to help\nyou.\u201d\n\nHanley was leaning forward, his hands on his knees, his eyes watching\nMarshall closely. \u201cThen you refuse?\u201d he said. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nMarshall regarded the senator steadily. His manner was untroubled. The\nlook he turned upon Hanley was one of grave disapproval.\n\n\u201cYou know why,\u201d he answered quietly. \u201cIt is impossible.\u201d\n\nIn sudden anger Hanley rose. Marshall, who had been seated behind his\ndesk, also rose. For a moment, in silence, the two men confronted each\nother. Then Hanley spoke; his tone was harsh and threatening.\n\n\u201cThen I am to understand,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cthat you refuse to carry out\nthe wishes of a United States Senator and of the President of the\nUnited States?\u201d\n\n\nIn front of Marshall, on his desk, was the little iron stamp of the\nconsulate. Protectingly, almost caressingly, he laid his hand upon it.\n\n\u201cI refuse,\u201d he corrected, \u201cto place the seal of this consulate on a\nlie.\u201d\n\nThere was a moment\u2019s pause. Miss Cairns, unwilling to remain, and\nunable to withdraw, clasped her hands unhappily and stared at the\nfloor. Livingstone exclaimed in indignant protest. Hanley moved a step\nnearer and, to emphasize what he said, tapped his knuckles on the desk.\nWith the air of one confident of his advantage, he spoke slowly and\nsoftly.\n\n\u201cDo you appreciate,\u201d he asked, \u201cthat, while you may be of some\nimportance down here in this fever swamp, in Washington I am supposed\nto carry some weight? Do you appreciate that I am a senator from a\nState that numbers four millions of people, and that you are preventing\nme from serving those people?\u201d Marshall inclined his head gravely and\npolitely.\n\n\u201cAnd I want you to appreciate,\u201d he said, \u201cthat while I have no weight\nat Washington, in this fever swamp I have the honor to represent eighty\nmillions of people, and as long as that consular sign is over my door I\ndon\u2019t intend to prostitute it for _you_, or the President of the United\nStates, or any one of those eighty millions.\u201d\n\nOf the two men, the first to lower his eyes was Hanley. He laughed\nshortly, and walked to the door. There he turned, and indifferently, as\nthough the incident no longer interested him, drew out his watch.\n\n\u201cMr. Marshall,\u201d he said, \u201cif the cable is working, I\u2019ll take your tin\nsign away from you by sunset.\u201d\n\nFor one of Marshall\u2019s traditions, to such a speech there was no answer\nsave silence. He bowed, and, apparently serene and undismayed, resumed\nhis seat. From the contest, judging from the manner of each, it was\nMarshall, not Hanley, who had emerged victorious.\n\nBut Miss Cairns was not deceived. Under the unexpected blow, Marshall\nhad turned older. His clear blue eyes had grown less alert, his broad\nshoulders seemed to stoop. In sympathy, her own eyes filled with sudden\ntears.\n\n\u201cWhat will you do?\u201d she whispered.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I shall do,\u201d said Marshall simply. \u201cI should have\nliked to have resigned. It\u2019s a prettier finish. After forty years\u2014to be\ndismissed by cable is\u2014it\u2019s a poor way of ending it.\u201d\n\nMiss Cairns rose and walked to the door. There she turned and looked\nback.\n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d she said. And both understood that in saying no more than\nthat she had best shown her sympathy.\n\nAn hour later the sympathy of Admiral Hardy was expressed more\ndirectly.\n\n\u201cIf he comes on board my ship,\u201d roared that gentleman, \u201cI\u2019ll push him\ndown an ammunition hoist and break his damned neck!\u201d\n\nMarshall laughed delightedly. The loyalty of his old friend was never\nso welcome.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll treat him with every courtesy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only satisfaction\nhe gets out of this is to see that he has hurt me. We will not give him\nthat satisfaction.\u201d\n\nBut Marshall found that to conceal his wound was more difficult than he\nhad anticipated. When, at tea time, on the deck of the war-ship, he\nagain met Senator Hanley and the guests of the _Serapis_, he could not\nforget that his career had come to an end. There was much to remind him\nthat this was so. He was made aware of it by the sad, sympathetic\nglances of the women; by their tactful courtesies; by the fact that\nLivingstone, anxious to propitiate Hanley, treated him rudely; by the\nsight of the young officers, each just starting upon a career of honor,\nand possible glory, as his career ended in humiliation; and by the big\nwar-ship herself, that recalled certain crises when he had only to\npress a button and war-ships had come at his bidding.\n\nAt five o\u2019clock there was an awkward moment. The Royal Mail boat,\nhaving taken on her cargo, passed out of the harbor on her way to\nJamaica, and dipped her colors. Senator Hanley, abandoned to his fate,\nobserved her departure in silence.\n\nLivingstone, hovering at his side, asked sympathetically: \u201cHave they\nanswered your cable, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have,\u201d said Hanley gruffly.\n\n\u201cWas it\u2014was it satisfactory?\u201d pursued the diplomat.\n\n\u201cIt _was_,\u201d said the senator, with emphasis.\n\nFar from discouraged, Livingstone continued his inquiries.\n\n\u201cAnd when,\u201d he asked eagerly, \u201care you going to tell him?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow!\u201d said the senator.\n\nThe guests were leaving the ship. When all were seated in the admiral\u2019s\nsteam launch, the admiral descended the accommodation ladder and\nhimself picked up the tiller ropes.\n\n\u201cMr. Marshall,\u201d he called, \u201cwhen I bring the launch broadside to the\nship and stop her, you will stand ready to receive the consul\u2019s\nsalute.\u201d\n\nInvoluntarily, Marshall uttered an exclamation of protest. He had\nforgotten that on leaving the war-ship, as consul, he was entitled to\nseven guns. Had he remembered, he would have insisted that the ceremony\nbe omitted. He knew that the admiral wished to show his loyalty, knew\nthat his old friend was now paying him this honor only as a rebuke to\nHanley. But the ceremony was no longer an honor. Hanley had made of it\na mockery. It served only to emphasize what had been taken from him.\nBut, without a scene, it now was too late to avoid it. The first of the\nseven guns had roared from the bow, and, as often he had stood before,\nas never he would so stand again, Marshall took his place at the\ngangway of the launch. His eyes were fixed on the flag, his gray head\nwas uncovered, his hat was pressed above his heart.\n\nFor the first time since Hanley had left the consulate, he fell into\nsudden terror lest he might give way to his emotions. Indignant at the\nthought, he held himself erect. His face was set like a mask, his eyes\nwere untroubled. He was determined they should not see that he was\nsuffering.\n\nAnother gun spat out a burst of white smoke, a stab of flame. There was\nan echoing roar. Another and another followed. Marshall counted seven,\nand then, with a bow to the admiral, backed from the gangway.\n\nAnd then another gun shattered the hot, heavy silence. Marshall,\nconfused, embarrassed, assuming he had counted wrong, hastily returned\nto his place. But again before he could leave it, in savage haste a\nninth gun roared out its greeting. He could not still be mistaken. He\nturned appealingly to his friend. The eyes of the admiral were fixed\nupon the war-ship. Again a gun shattered the silence. Was it a jest?\nWere they laughing at him? Marshall flushed miserably. He gave a swift\nglance toward the others. They were smiling. Then it _was_ a jest.\nBehind his back, something of which they all were cognizant was going\nforward. The face of Livingstone alone betrayed a like bewilderment to\nhis own. But the others, who knew, were mocking him.\n\nFor the thirteenth time a gun shook the brooding swamp land of Porto\nBanos. And then, and not until then, did the flag crawl slowly from the\nmast-head. Mary Cairns broke the tenseness by bursting into tears. But\nMarshall saw that every one else, save she and Livingstone, were still\nsmiling. Even the bluejackets in charge of the launch were grinning at\nhim. He was beset by smiling faces. And then from the war-ship,\nunchecked, came, against all regulations, three long, splendid cheers.\n\nMarshall felt his lips quivering, the warm tears forcing their way to\nhis eyes. He turned beseechingly to his friend. His voice trembled.\n\n\u201cCharles,\u201d he begged, \u201care they laughing at me?\u201d\n\nEagerly, before the other would answer, Senator Hanley tossed his cigar\ninto the water and, scrambling forward, seized Marshall by the hand.\n\n\u201cMr. Marshall,\u201d he cried, \u201cour President has great faith in Abraham\nLincoln\u2019s judgment of men. And this salute means that this morning he\nappointed you our new minister to The Hague. I\u2019m one of those\npoliticians who keeps his word. I _told_ you I\u2019d take your tin sign\naway from you by sunset. I\u2019ve done it!\u201d",
