    "body": "The rugged little stellar scout ship flared down to the surface of Kappa\nOrionis VII about a mile from the aboriginal village. The pilot,\nLieutenant Eric Haruhiku, scorched an open field, but pointed out to\nLouis Mayne that he had been careful to disturb neither woodland nor\nshoreline.\n\n\"The Kappans are touchy about those, Judge,\" he explained, \"They fish a\nlot, as you'd guess from all these shallow seas, and they pick fruit in\nthe forests; but they don't farm much.\"\n\n\"No use provoking trouble,\" Mayne approved. \"It's a long way from\nRigel.\"\n\n\"It's a longer way from Sol,\" said the pilot.\n\n\"Don't I know, boy! If it weren't, I'd be just another retired space\ncaptain, quietly struggling with my ranch on Rigel IX. As it is, to get\nthe grant, I had to remain on call as an arbitrator.\"\n\n\"Somebody has to settle these things,\" said Haruhiku. \"There's not much\nlaw way out here, except what the Space Force can apply. Well, if you'll\nexcuse me, sir, I'll have them get out the helicopter and take us over\nto the village.\"\n\n\"Let me see that last message again, before you go,\" Mayne requested.\n\nThe pilot extracted a sheet from his clipboard and handed it to Mayne as\nhe left. Mayne studied the text with little pleasure.\n\nTerran Space Force headquarters on Rigel IX wished to inform him that\nthe long awaited envoy from Terra to Kappa Orionis VII not only had\narrived but had departed two days behind Mayne.\n\nIt was hoped, the communication continued, that nothing would interfere\nwith the desired objective of coming to some friendly agreement with the\nKappans that would permit Terran use of the planet as a base for\nspaceships. The envoy, of course, was prepared to offer trade\ninducements and various other forms of help to the semi-civilized\nnatives. Mayne was requested to lay whatever groundwork he could.\n\n_In my spare time, no doubt_, he reflected. _I'm to settle this silly\nbusiness any way at all--as long as the natives get their way. But has\nanybody told the government about insurance companies? If it costs money\nor a lawsuit, will they back me up?_\n\nHe felt himself to be in a ridiculous dilemma. The Kappans were reported\nto have seized a Terran spaceship as it landed to trade. Naturally, the\ncaptain had squawked for help. He claimed he had crashed; his insurance\ncompany thought otherwise; the Kappans seemed to have some entirely\ndifferent idea in mind. Mayne had been summoned into action to render a\ndecision, after the rough and ready system of these settlements on the\nsurface of Terra's sphere of explored space.\n\nRegretfully, he made his way now to the cubbyhole allowed him on the\ncramped scout, where he changed to a more formal tunic of a bright blue\nhe hoped would look impressive to native eyes. By the time he was ready,\nthe helicopter was waiting. He and Haruhiku entered, and the crewman at\nthe controls took off for the scene of the dispute.\n\nArriving over the village, they hovered a few minutes while Haruhiku\nstudied the lay of the land. The lieutenant had been to this world\nbefore, long enough to pick up some of the language and customs, so\nMayne was content to follow his advice about landing a little way off\nfrom a spaceship that towered outside the village.\n\nThey came down about a hundred yards away, between a rutted sort of road\nand a long hut covered by a curved, thatched roof.\n\n\"They're expecting us,\" said Haruhiku, gesturing at the group before the\nhut.\n\nIt consisted of half a dozen humans and several of the Kappan natives.\nThe latter, naturally, caught Mayne's eye first. The most imposing\nindividual among them stood about five feet tall. The planet being of\nabout the same mass as Terra, the Kappan probably weighed over two\nhundred and fifty pounds. He was a rugged biped with something saurian\nin his ancestry; for his skin was scaled, and bony plates grew into a\nlow crown upon his long skull. His arms and legs were heavy and bowed,\nwith joints obscured by thick muscles and loose skin. Mayne was struck\nby the fancy that the Kappan's color, a blend of brown and olive, was\nthat of a small dragon who had achieved a good suntan. A yellow kilt was\nhis main article of attire, although he wore a few decorations of\npolished bone.\n\n\n\nOne of the Terrans stepped forward. He wore a semimilitary uniform.\n\n\"I suppose you're Louis Mayne?\" he asked.\n\n\"Right,\" answered Mayne. \"You would be Captain Voorhis, of the\n_Gemsbok_?\"\n\n\"Check. This here is Eemakh. He's more or less chief of the village, or\ntribe, or whatever you wanna call it.\"\n\nMayne found his gaze sinking into catlike slits of jet in a pair of huge\norange eyes shaded by massive brow ridges. The native made some\nstatement in a clicking language that had a harsh, choppy rhythm.\n\n\"He welcomes you to Kappa,\" Haruhiku interpreted. \"He hopes the gods\nwill not be displeased.\"\n\n\"What a warm welcome!\" commented Mayne. \"Have you been getting along\nthat well, Captain Voorhis?\"\n\n\"Just about,\" said the spacer. \"One of my boys knows a few words. Rest\nof the time, we make signs. I gotta admit they ain't been too\nunfriendly.\"\n\n\"But they _have_ seized your ship?\"\n\n\"You're damn' right! That insurance guy they sent out don't see it that\nway though.\"\n\n\"Where is this representative of the Belt Insurance Company?\" asked\nMayne.\n\n\"Melin? His ship landed over on the other side of the village, about\nhalf a mile. He oughta be along soon. Must've seen you land.\"\n\nMayne wondered whether it were necessary to await the arrival of the\ninsurance adjustor before asking any questions. To cover his hesitation,\nhe turned to take his first good look at the hull of the _Gemsbok_.\n\n\"What do they think they're doing?\" he demanded, staring.\n\nThe _Gemsbok_ was--or had been--an ungraceful, thick starship on the\nverge of aging into scrap. Towering here between the village and the\nhuge, bluish-green leaves of the Kappan forest, she was in the process\nof being transformed into a planet-bound object of a certain weird\ngrace.\n\nA framework was being constructed about the hull by a swarm of natives.\nThey had reached halfway up the ship, which served as a central column.\nMuch of the exterior appeared to be a network of strangely curved\nsections of wood that had been given a high polish. Mayne suspected the\ngreenish highlights were reflections of the forest color.\n\n\"Bone,\" said Voorhis succinctly. \"They collect it from things they catch\nin the sea. Main supports of timber, of course, built to fit the hull.\"\n\n\"The fish here grow very large,\" put in Haruhiku. \"If you could call\nthem fish, that is. I once saw them butchering what looked more like a\ndinosaur.\"\n\nMayne realized that the bone framework formed a sort of curtain wall. At\nthe lower levels, some of the natives seemed to be experimenting with a\ncoating of wet leaves which they were molding to the wall.\n\n\"They've soaked them in something they boil out of fish parts,\" his\npilot explained. \"Like the village roofs. When it dries, it's pretty\nhard, even waterproof. The stink never dries out.\"\n\n\"But what do they have in their bony little brains?\" asked Mayne. \"Just\nwhat is that mess supposed to be?\"\n\n\"A temple, believe it or not,\" answered Voorhis. \"They tell me I set her\ndown on land sacred to the great god Meeg!\"\n\nMayne looked at Haruhiku.\n\n\"Oh, come on, now! I came all the way from--\" He stopped as he noticed\nthe pilot's grave expression. \"Oh! That sort of thing _could_ be\nserious, I guess.\"\n\nHe imagined he had seen the chief, Eemakh, come alert at the mention of\nthe local god. Mayne sighed. It was going to be a long day.\n\nHe was saved for the time being by a hail from the direction of the\nvillage. A procession was approaching along the set of ruts between\nMayne and the ship.\n\n\n\nThe place of honor appeared to be occupied by a two-wheeled cart of\ncrude but massive design. Upon it rode a Kappan driver, two Kappans with\nspears and the look of official guards, and a Terran with a death-grip\nupon the side railing. A brace of truculent beasts of frighteningly\nsaurian mien shuffled ponderously along in the loose harness. From time\nto time, one or the other would stumble over a turn in his rut and emit\na menacing rumble as if he suspected his team mate of causing the\nmisstep.\n\nBefore and behind this conveyance marched a guard of honor of Kappan\nwarriors. The rear contingent kept close to the cart, but the advance\nparty had opened a noticeable gap between themselves and the hulking\nteam.\n\nThe procession halted, the soldier in charge raised his spear in salute\nto Eemakh, and the shaken Terran was assisted to dismount. He introduced\nhimself to Mayne as Robert Melin.\n\n\"Let's go over to the hut they made for us an' sit down,\" suggested\nVoorhis.\n\nMelin, a tall, gloomy blond whose civilian suit seemed a trifle formal\nfor the surroundings, acceded gratefully. He mopped the dust from his\nlong face and watched the cart being turned around.\n\nThe procession moved off in the direction of the village, the advance\nguard stepping out especially smartly, and Mayne began to get his\nconference arranged.\n\nHe learned that the evicted crew of the _Gemsbok_ had been living in the\nhut nearby. Before it stood a long table with benches, all evidently\nknocked together from recently felled timber. Melin was given credit for\nthis by Voorhis, since before the arrival of the insurance adjuster and\nhis crew, no power tools had been available to the men from the\n_Gemsbok_.\n\nMayne took a place at the end of the table. Some of the _Gemsbok's_ crew\ncame out of the hut to watch. Most of the Kappan warriors attending the\nchief took up stations between the table and the ship, in a manner\nsuggesting long habit. Mayne guessed that attempts had been made to\nre-enter the ship.\n\nHe put Haruhiku at his right hand to translate should it be necessary.\nMelin and Voorhis sat at his left, their backs to the hut. To the other\nside of the table, Eemakh brought two Kappans who were explained to\nMayne as being the tribal high priest, Igrillik, and Kaynox, who\nrepresented a sort of district overlord.\n\n\"I meant to land up by _their_ city,\" Voorhis put in, \"but we hit some\nbad winds up in the stratosphere. We got knocked around a bit in the\nstorm, and set down where we could.\"\n\n\"Well, tell me about the details,\" said Mayne. \"I want to get this\nstraight from the start, if I can. By the way, Lieutenant Haruhiku,\nexplain to the chief that a special envoy is on the way, that we want\nhis friendship, and that he will be dealt with fairly.\"\n\nHe waited out the exchange of choppy speech between the pilot and\nEemakh.\n\n\"He says he is sure he will be fairly dealt with,\" reported Haruhiku.\n\n\"I wonder what he meant by that,\" murmured Mayne. \"If we make a deal\nhere, and thereby with his overlord, will that cover enough territory to\nbe official?\"\n\n\"As much as you can get together anywhere on this world, sir.\"\n\nMayne nodded, then turned to Captain Voorhis.\n\n\"Now about this so-called crash?\" he prompted.\n\n\"Well, there was this storm, like I said. Trouble was we didn't expect\nto hit it and ... well ... somebody took it in his head to blow some of\nthe fuel tanks for a crash landing. That's why I'm not claimin' anythin'\non the fuel,\" he finished, turning to Melin.\n\n\"We are perfectly willing to pay on that item,\" replied the insurance\nman.\n\n\"Anyhow,\" continued Voorhis, \"I set down here where we saw the open\nspot, an' then of course we were stuck with nothin' to lift off with. It\nlooked all right. We'd unload our goods, an' if the local crowd couldn't\nuse them all, why they'd pass the rest on at a profit to themselves. So\nwe come out to palaver, an' then they won't let us go back in the ship.\nWe were just lucky my com man had sent out a landing report when it\nlooked like we piled up, or the Space Force patrol never woulda heard of\nus.\"\n\n\"Was there any trouble?\" asked Mayne. \"Any unnecessary hostility?\"\n\nVoorhis considered, rubbing the back of his head thoughtfully.\n\n\"Well ... I suppose, lookin' at it their way, they coulda been a lot\nrougher. A couple of punches got thrown, an' one of my boys got a spear\nbusted over his head, but mostly they acted ... well ... maybe more like\ncops than cannibals.\"\n\n\"Just enforcing the native laws, eh?\"\n\n\n\nVoorhis did not swallow that quite so graciously. He did not know or\ncare what the local laws might be, but he thought it suspicious in the\nextreme that he should have plopped down exactly upon the spot chosen by\nthe natives for a temple.\n\n\"So do they have to use my ship to hang it on?\" he finished plaintively.\n\n\"The company is in agreement with you there, captain,\" Melin put in.\n\"You see, Judge, our point is that nothing is really lost or seriously\ndamaged, neither ship nor cargo. They are merely being withheld from\ntheir rightful owner, and we believe that puts the responsibility for\nrecovery upon the Terran government. Captain Voorhis has our entire\nsympathy--\"\n\n\"Yeah!\" said Voorhis. \"An' if I get my head sliced off tryin' to get at\nthat undamaged cargo, you'll come to my funeral! I say it's a loss!\"\n\n\"Now, gentlemen!\" interrupted Mayne. \"Let me get on with this. Both of\nyou, I'm sure, realize that I'm not a lawyer in spite of being a special\njudge. If the colonies way out here had enough lawyers to spare, I\ncertainly wouldn't be sticking my head into this. Nevertheless, any\ndecision I make here will be regarded as legally binding by the\ngovernment of Rigel IX, so let us remain level-headed.\"\n\n\"Very well, Judge,\" said Melin. \"Here are the figures on--\"\n\n\"Please round them off,\" said Mayne. \"If I have to listen to a long list\nin centicredits, I'll probably go off to see what kind of beer they brew\nhere.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't like it,\" muttered Voorhis, staring sourly at the village.\n\n\"No doubt,\" grinned Mayne.\n\nMelin swallowed and returned to an inner pocket a sheaf of papers he had\nwithdrawn.\n\n\"Speaking very loosely,\" he went on, as if hating to do anything\nloosely, \"the coverage was about as follows: for the _Gemsbok_ herself,\ntwo million; but that was really a nominal figure accorded as a sort of\ncourtesy. Otherwise, at her true worth, the authorities would hardly\nhave permitted Captain Voorhis to take her into space--\"\n\n\"Get on with it,\" urged Mayne, to forestall any wrangle.\n\n\"Er ... yes. Then on the cargo, the purchase cost of two hundred\nthousand credits.\"\n\nVoorhis visibly flinched and began to acquire a ruddy hue.\n\n\"And, finally, on the fuel load, the cost price of three hundred\nthousand. Of course, Judge, there are detailed clauses as to normal use\nof fuel. He was actually insured against defects, premature explosions,\naccidental loss, et cetera.\"\n\nMayne did some addition in his head.\n\n\"So your company,\" he said aloud, \"is prepared to pay two and a half\nmillion for the loss sustained by Captain Voorhis. What seems to be\nwrong with that?\"\n\nBoth men began to talk but Melin, struggling less with temper, got the\nlead.\n\n\"Actually,\" he said, \"we feel liable for only three hundred thousand.\"\n\n_Now it will get tough_, thought Mayne. He silently awaited elucidation.\n\nThe combined stares of all parties, including the enigmatic glance of\nEemakh, calmed the spluttering Voorhis. Melin continued.\n\n\"In the first place, the true value of the ship, even if we consider her\nto be incapacitated--which we do not--is only about one hundred and\nfifty thousand.\"\n\n\"She's worth more than that as scrap!\" bellowed Voorhis.\n\n\"No, captain, just about that. It is exactly how we valued her. Do you\nhave any idea, Judge, of how old that crock is?\"\n\n\"Let's not go into that just yet,\" suggested Mayne.\n\n\"As to the fuel,\" said Melin, \"I am willing, as a gesture of good will,\nto stick my company's neck out--and mine with it, you may be sure--and\nhonor a full claim.\"\n\n\"Even though he used about half the fuel getting here?\" asked Mayne.\n\n\"We'll ignore that. We admit that he is out of fuel, and we want to--\"\n\n\"You want to give me a moon and take a star,\" said Voorhis.\n\n\"Just a minute!\" Mayne held up his hand. \"That's the ship and the fuel.\nWhat about the cargo?\"\n\n\"Why, as to that, Judge, we do not admit that it is lost. It is right\nover there, easily accessible. We consider it more the job of the Space\nForce to restore rightful possession than it is the responsibility of\nthe company to reimburse Captain Voorhis for the inflated value he sets\nupon it.\"\n\n\"I begin to see,\" murmured Mayne. \"You can't stick each other, so you're\nout to slip _me_ the bill.\"\n\nThat aroused a babble of denials. Mayne eventually made himself heard\nand demanded to know how the spacer's evaluation differed from Melin's.\nVoorhis pulled himself together, glowering at the insurance man.\n\n\n\n\"In the first place,\" he growled, \"I don't want his lousy payment for\nfuel. I said I'd take the blame for that, an' I will. On the ship ...\nwell, maybe she ain't worth two million. Maybe she ain't been for a few\nyears now--\"\n\nMelin made a show of counting on his fingers.\n\n\"... But they charged me premiums by that figure an' I say they oughta\npay by that figure.\"\n\n\"But can you prove she's a total loss, captain?\" asked Mayne.\n\nVoorhis grimaced and spat upon the ground.\n\n\"Try to get near her, Judge! You'll get proof fast enough!\"\n\n\"Well ... about the cargo, then?\"\n\n\"_That's_ where he's gouging me!\" exploded Voorhis. \"The idea of using\nthe cost as of loading on Rigel IX! Hell, you know the margin of profit\nthere is in trading on these new planets, twenty to one at least. I\nfigured to lift off with four million worth of ores, gems, curios, and\nwhatnot.\"\n\n\"So your point is that the mere transportation of the goods through\nspace to this planet increased their value. What about that, Mr. Melin?\"\n\nMelin shifted uncomfortably on his bench. Mayne would have liked to\nchange his own position, but feared splinters.\n\n\"There is an element of truth in that,\" admitted Melin. \"Still, it would\nbe rash to expect such a return every time a tramp spaceship lands to\nswap with some aboriginal easy marks.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Mayne, \"that our orange-eyed friends speak no Terran?\"\n\n\"I hope not!\" exclaimed Voorhis.\n\n\"Well, anyway,\" Melin said after a startled pause, \"how can we be\nexpected to pay off on hopes? He wants the paper figure for the ship;\nbut he refuses the paper figure for the cargo.\"\n\nMayne shrugged. He turned to Haruhiku.\n\n\"If Captain Voorhis and Mr. Melin don't mind, lieutenant, I'd like to\nget the chief's view of all this.\"\n\n\"Hah!\" grunted Voorhis, clapping both hands to his head.\n\nMelin contented himself with rolling his eyes skyward.\n\nWith Haruhiku translating, Mayne began to get acquainted with the\nKappans. The visitor from the neighboring city chose mostly to listen\nattentively, but Igrillik, the priest, occasionally leaned over to\nwhisper sibilantly into Eemakh's recessed ear. Mayne fancied he saw a\nresemblance between the two, despite Igrillik's professional\ntrappings--a long robe of rough material that had been dyed in stripes\nand figures of several crude colors, and a tall cap to which were\nattached a number of pairs of membraneous wings.\n\nThe first thing that Mayne learned was that the _Gemsbok_ was not a\nspaceship; it was a symbol, a sign sent to the Kappans by the great god\nMeeg.\n\n\"And why did he send it?\" asked Mayne.\n\nHe had sent it as a sign that he was impatient with his children. They\nhad vowed him a temple, they had set aside the necessary land, and yet\nthey had not begun the work.\n\n\"Is that why they're all over there, slaving away so feverishly?\"\n\nIt was indeed the reason. After all, Meeg was the god of the inner moon,\nthe one that passed so speedily across the sky. If he could guide the\nstrangers' ship directly to his own plot of ground, he might just as\neasily have caused it to land in the center of the village. They had\nseen the flames that attended the landing. Could the honored chief from\nthe stars blame them for heeding the warning?\n\n\"I see their point,\" muttered Mayne resignedly. \"Well, maybe we can talk\nsense about the cargo. Tell them that there is much in the holds that\nwould make their lives richer. Tools, gems, fine cloth--give them the\nstory, lieutenant.\"\n\nThis time, Eemakh conferred with the high priest. It developed that the\ncargo was a sacred gift to be used or not as the god Meeg might\nsubsequently direct. The chief meant no insult. The Kappans realized\nthat Voorhis and his crew were no demons, but starmen such as had often\nbrought valuable goods to trade. The Kappans had not sought to harm or\nsacrifice them, had they? This was because they were both welcome as\nvisitors and respected as instruments of Meeg.\n\nEemakh wished to be fair. The starmen might think they had lost by the\ndivine mission. Very well--they would be granted land, good land with\nforest for hunting and shoreline for fishing. But go near the temple\nthey should not!\n\n\"Could _I_ get in to inspect the cargo?\" asked Mayne.\n\nHaruhiku took this up with the Kappans, who softened but did not yield.\n\n\"The best I can get, Judge,\" said the pilot, \"is that they wish it were\npossible but only those who serve the purposes of Meeg may enter.\"\n\n\"They _would_ look at it that way,\" sighed Mayne. \"Let's leave it at\nthat, until we can think this over some more. It's time for a lunch\nbreak anyway.\"\n\n\n\nHe and Haruhiku were flown back to the scout ship. Mayne brooded\nsilently most of the way. Voorhis thought he was entitled to about six\nmillion credits for ship and cargo; Melin thought half a million for the\nship and fuel would be stretching it. Mayne foresaw that he would have\nto knock heads.\n\nThe two of them lunched in the pilot's cabin, with hardly room to drop a\nspoon. Except for companionship, Mayne would as soon have eaten standing\nin the galley.\n\nHe considered the vast area of the planet's land surface. Would it be\nwiser for the envoy to land elsewhere? What sort of ties were there\nbetween tribes?\n\n\"Loose,\" the pilot told him. \"Still, word gets around, with no great\nmountain or ocean barriers. They've split into groups, but there is a\nlot of contact.\"\n\n\"So if the Space Force should seize the _Gemsbok_, they'll all hear\nabout it?\"\n\n\"Within a few weeks, sir. That kind of news has wings on any world. I\nthink we could take her for you, but we might do some damage. The size\nof a scout crew doesn't lend itself to hand-to-hand brawls.\"\n\n\"And if you sling a couple of torpedoes at the Kappan village, you'll\nprobably wipe it out,\" said Mayne thoughtfully. \"Give the story a month\nto spread, and no Terran would be trusted anywhere on the planet. Hm-m-m\n... hardly practical!\"\n\n\"There would also be a chance of damaging the _Gemsbok_.\"\n\n\"Actually, Eric, I'd hardly care if you blew her into orbit, with\nVoorhis and Melin riding the fins! But I'm supposed to spread sweetness\nand light around here--not scraps and parts of spaceships.\"\n\nHe gnawed moodily upon a knuckle, but saw no way to escape putting up\nsome government money. Soaking the company would just make _them_ appeal\ninstead of Voorhis.\n\n\"This Meeg,\" he said to change the subject. \"How important is he?\"\n\nHaruhiku considered a moment before replying.\n\n\"They have a whole mess of gods, like most primitive societies. Meeg is\npretty important. I think he has a special significance to this tribe\n... you know, like some ancient Terran cities has a special patron.\"\n\n\"He's the god of that little moon?\" Mayne asked.\n\n\"Oh, more than that, I think. Really the god of speed, a message bearer\nfor the other divinities. There always seems to be one in every\nprimitive mythology.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" murmured Mayne. \"Let's see ... one parallel would be the ancient\nTerran Hermes, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"Something like that,\" agreed Haruhiku. \"I'm a little vague on the\nsubject, sir. At least, he isn't one of the bloodthirsty ones.\"\n\n\"That helps,\" sighed Mayne, \"but not enough.\"\n\nHe got a message blank from the pilot. With some labor, he composed a\nrequest to Terran headquarters on Rigel IX for authorization to spend\ntwo million credits on good-will preparations for the Terran-Kappan\ntreaty conference.\n\n_It almost sounds diplomatic_, he told himself before having the message\nsent.\n\nThe waiting period that followed was more to be blamed upon headquarters\npussyfooting than upon the subspace transmission. When an answer finally\ncame, it required a further exchange of messages.\n\nMayne's last communique might have been boiled down to, \"But I _need_\nit!\"\n\nThe last reply granted provisional permission to spend the sum\nmentioned; but gleaming between the lines like the sweep of a revolving\nbeacon was a strong intimation that Mayne had better not hope to charge\nthe item to \"good will.\" The budget just was not made that way, the hint\nconcluded.\n\n\"It's due to get dark soon, isn't it?\" he asked Haruhiku, crumpling the\nfinal message into a side pocket. \"I don't believe I'll resume the talks\ntill morning. Maybe my head will function again by then.\"\n\n\n\nIn the morning, one of the scout's crew again took the pilot and Mayne\nto the meeting by helicopter. Mayne spent part of the trip mulling over\na message Haruhiku had received. The spaceship _Diamond Belt_ could be\nexpected to arrive in orbit about the planet later the same day, bearing\nspecial envoy J. P. McDonald. The captain, having been informed of\nHaruhiku's presence, requested landing advice.\n\n\"I told him what I know,\" said the pilot. \"We can give him a beam down,\nof course, unless you think we should send him somewhere else.\"\n\n\"Well ... let's see how this goes,\" said Mayne. \"They seem to be waiting\nfor us down there.\"\n\nThey landed to find Voorhis, Melin, and the native officialdom gathered\nat the hut facing the new \"temple.\" After exchanging greetings, they sat\ndown at the table as they had the day before.\n\n\"All right, gentlemen,\" said Mayne to the two Terrans. \"You win. The\ngovernment is going to have to put something in the pot. I want to make\nit as little as possible, so let us have no more nonsense about the true\nvalue of ship or cargo as they stand.\"\n\nThey looked startled at his tone. Mayne went on before they could\nrecover.\n\n\"The object I have in mind, if it seems at all possible, is to put\nCaptain Voorhis back in business without costing Mr. Melin his job. Now,\nlet's put our heads together on that problem and worry about justifying\nourselves later.\"\n\nThe most difficult part was to convince Voorhis to surrender his dream\nof fantastic profits; but sometime before Mayne got hoarse, the captain\nwas made to see that he could not have his cake and eat it, too.\n\nMelin agreed that he might pay the paper value of the _Gemsbok_ if he\ncould pay likewise for the cargo, in which case he would admit a loss.\nAfter all, a spaceship anchored by a temple might reasonably be termed\nunspaceworthy. He would take over the cargo and cut his losses by\nallowing the government to buy it at two million.\n\n\"You wanna come with me next trip?\" invited Voorhis when he heard this.\n\"If that's how you cut loose, we'll make a fortune!\"\n\n\"Well, there it is,\" said Mayne, straightening up to ease his aching\nback. He must have been leaning tensely over the table longer than he\nhad thought. \"The captain gets two and a half million, Mr. Melin gets\noff with paying only half a million, and you've stuck me for the rest.\"\n\n\"Congratulations, Judge!\" said Melin. \"You now own a ship and cargo\nwhich I presume you will present to the Kappans.\"\n\n\"How can he?\" demanded Voorhis. \"They figure they own it already.\"\n\n\"We'll worry about that later,\" said Mayne.\n\n\"_You_ will!\" Voorhis guffawed. \"I hope you get _some_ credit out of\nit.\"\n\nHaruhiku interrupted to inform Mayne that the Kappans, who had been\ninterested if bewildered listeners, had invited the Terrans to a small\nfeast.\n\n\"I translated enough to let them understand there would be no attempt to\ndisturb their temple building,\" he explained. \"They now feel they owe us\nhospitality.\"\n\n\"Good, that's something,\" said Mayne.\n\n\"I'll tell you what else will be something,\" grunted Voorhis. \"The\nfood!\"\n\nThe assemblage repaired to the Kappan village. The Terrans--though it\ntook some doing--survived the feast.\n\nMayne thought it best not to inquire into the nature of the dishes\nserved. Eemakh was evidently determined to display his village's finest\nhospitality, so the Terrans even tried the Kappan beer. Mayne absorbed\nenough to get used to it.\n\n_Or did it absorb me?_ he wondered. _Igrillik's beginning to look almost\nhuman!_\n\nEventually, carts were brought, and they rode bumpily out to admire\nprogress made on the temple. A fresh breeze helped Mayne to remember\nthat it was now late afternoon and he had yet to settle one matter with\nEemakh.\n\nWhen they arrived at the site, crewmen from the _Gemsbok_ saw fit to\ntake Voorhis in charge and carry him into their hut. Mayne sank down at\nthe table outside, watching Melin grope to a place beside him. He\nnoticed that Haruhiku's helicopter pilot handed him a message as soon as\nthe lieutenant alighted.\n\n\"That will be from the _Diamond Belt_,\" Mayne guessed.\n\nHe eyed Melin with some amusement. The insurance man stared very quietly\nat the board beneath his elbows. His complexion held a tint of green.\nEven Eemakh, plodding ponderously up, lowered himself to a bench with a\nsigh. The high priest seemed less affected by the celebration, and Mayne\nwas proud when Haruhiku walked over with his normal bland alertness.\n\n\"They're getting near?\" he asked.\n\n\"Doing braking circles,\" reported the pilot. \"I sent an order for the\nscout to give them a beam. There may still be time to send them\nsomewhere else--\"\n\n\"One more try here first,\" Mayne decided. \"Tell Eemakh we want to\nstraighten out some confusion about Meeg and the cargo.\"\n\n\n\nHaruhiku permitted himself a small shrug and translated. Eemakh aroused\nhimself to a show of interest, while Igrillik turned a suspicious orange\nstare upon Mayne. The latter strove to frame in his mind an argument\nthat would strike them as logical.\n\n\"Tell him,\" he instructed, \"that we believe this Meeg was known on\nTerra, but by another name. Then describe the mythical Hermes and see\nwhat he says.\"\n\nHaruhiku began a conversation that lasted several minutes. Igrillik, as\nan authority, obviously felt moved to deliver a lengthy opinion. At\nlast, the pilot turned to Mayne.\n\n\"They say we are to be congratulated,\" he reported.\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"Well, they do seem a bit more friendly. I was going to try drawing a\npicture of that famous statue, with the winged heels and hat, but it\nwould never match their own conception. Igrillik asks if you claim\nbelief in Meeg.\"\n\n\"Avoid that,\" said Mayne. \"Now--do they know about ship communications?\"\n\n\"They are aware that it is done,\" said Haruhiku. \"After all, they just\nsaw me send a message to the scout over the helicopter screen.\"\n\n\"Good! Point out to them that the _Gemsbok_ also has such equipment.\"\n\nHaruhiku engaged in another long talk. The Kappans began to show signs\nof uneasiness at the end. They remained silent.\n\n\"And that therefore,\" added Mayne, \"the Terran who served this machine\nshould rank in their eyes as a servant of Meeg just as much as Igrillik.\nThe cargo in the ship was no more his than a message belongs to the\nmessenger bearing it.\"\n\nThe pilot put this into Kappan, with gestures.\n\n\"And furthermore,\" said Mayne, before it could be suggested that the\nowner might be Meeg, \"what I have arranged here with Melin and Voorhis\nis that the cargo now belongs to all of the Terran people.\"\n\nEemakh began to scowl, an impressive contortion on a broad, olive Kappan\nvisage. Mayne hurried on.\n\n\"This being the case, the Kappans _have absolutely no right_ to deny us\nthe privilege of contributing all these goods to the glory of their\ntemple!\"\n\n\"Oh, boy!\" grunted Haruhiku. He rattled off the translation.\n\nMayne watched it hit home. Igrillik leaned over to peer at him\nunbelievingly. Eemakh seemed to have difficulty in focusing his glowing\neyes on the Terran.\n\nThere were, of course, requests for clarification. Mayne left the\nrepetitions to the pilot.\n\nIn the end, Eemakh arose and embraced him, a startling action that left\nMayne feeling introspectively of his ribs. Igrillik called out something\nto the bodyguard attending the chief, causing Mayne to repress a shudder\nat the flashing display of big Kappan teeth. He assumed that a smile was\na humanoid constant.\n\nHaruhiku's pilot approached with a new message.\n\n\"Now they have to land near here, in half an hour or less,\" said the\nspacer.\n\n\"There's just one more thing,\" Mayne told him. \"Voorhis is satisfied,\nMelin--look, he's gone to sleep on the table!--is relieved, the Kappans\nare friendly, and J. P. McDonald will be happy when he lands. Now I have\nto get myself off the hook for two million!\"\n\nHe turned to the _Gemsbok_ crewmen loitering before the hut.\n\n\"Who was the communications man?\" he demanded.\n\nA lean, freckled youth with a big nose admitted to the distinction.\nMayne draped an arm about his shoulders and told him he was back in\nbusiness.\n\n\"Say to them,\" he instructed Haruhiku, \"that if they are to learn how to\nuse the equipment Meeg has provided for their temple, they must not\ndelay one minute in taking our friend here into the ship ... uh ... make\nthat 'temple.' He will show them how a spaceship is called down from the\nskies.\"\n\nHaruhiku gave him a straight-faced glance that was a masked guffaw. He\ntranslated, and orders began to be shouted back and forth among the\nKappans, all the way to the top-most level of the construction. The\nlieutenant called his pilot.\n\n\"I'll have him flash the scout an order to monitor the _Gemsbok_ and\ntransfer landing control as soon as they hear her on the air,\" he\nexplained.\n\nMayne nodded. He clutched the arm of the _Gemsbok_ operator, who was\nbeing urged away by Igrillik and a group of warrior escorts.\n\n\"Just one thing, son,\" he shouted over the babble. \"Forget about the\nship's call sign. You go on the air calling yourself Kappa Orionis\nCentral Control.\"\n\n\"Kappa Orionis Central...?\" repeated the youth distrustfully.\n\n\"You've got it,\" said Mayne, and shoved him on his way. He turned to\nHaruhiku. \"The last thing to do is to send the helicopter for some\npaint. I don't care if it _isn't_ dry when the _Diamond Belt_ touches\ndown--I want a sign over the door of this hut!\"\n\n\"A sign?\"\n\n\"Make it read 'Spaceport Number 1.' Two million is cheap enough for\nbuying a spaceport already in operation. There won't be any trouble,\nsince the Kappans promised the land.\"\n\nEveryone seemed to be running somewhere. Mayne wiped his face with a\nhandkerchief and sat down beside Melin, who looked comfortable enough\nwith his head on the table.\n\nFrom inside the hut, Mayne could hear snores that must have Voorhis as a\nsource; the rest of the _Gemsbok_ crewmen had followed the crowd to the\ncontrol tower that was also a temple. After a while, Haruhiku returned\nand sat down across from Melin.\n\n\"Magnificent, Judge!\" he said. \"We might even get away with it.\"\n\n\"Of course we will,\" said Mayne, gazing at Melin and listening to\nVoorhis. \"After all, Hermes was the god of thieves, too!\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n",
