    "body": "The man of fancy made an entertainment at one of his castles in the\nair, and invited a select number of distinguished personages to favor\nhim with their presence. The mansion, though less splendid than many\nthat have been situated in the same region, was nevertheless of a\nmagnificence such as is seldom witnessed by those acquainted only with\nterrestrial architecture. Its strong foundations and massive walls were\nquarried out of a ledge of heavy and sombre clouds which had hung\nbrooding over the earth, apparently as dense and ponderous as its own\ngranite, throughout a whole autumnal day. Perceiving that the general\neffect was gloomy,\u2014so that the airy castle looked like a feudal\nfortress, or a monastery of the Middle Ages, or a state prison of our\nown times, rather than the home of pleasure and repose which he\nintended it to be,\u2014the owner, regardless of expense, resolved to gild\nthe exterior from top to bottom. Fortunately, there was just then a\nflood of evening sunshine in the air. This being gathered up and poured\nabundantly upon the roof and walls, imbued them with a kind of solemn\ncheerfulness; while the cupolas and pinnacles were made to glitter with\nthe purest gold, and all the hundred windows gleamed with a glad light,\nas if the edifice itself were rejoicing in its heart.\n\nAnd now, if the people of the lower world chanced to be looking upward\nout of the turmoil of their petty perplexities, they probably mistook\nthe castle in the air for a heap of sunset clouds, to which the magic\nof light and shade had imparted the aspect of a fantastically\nconstructed mansion. To such beholders it was unreal, because they\nlacked the imaginative faith. Had they been worthy to pass within its\nportal, they would have recognized the truth, that the dominions which\nthe spirit conquers for itself among unrealities become a thousand\ntimes more real than the earth whereon they stamp their feet, saying,\n\u201cThis is solid and substantial; this may be called a fact.\u201d\n\nAt the appointed hour, the host stood in his great saloon to receive\nthe company. It was a vast and noble room, the vaulted ceiling of which\nwas supported by double rows of gigantic pillars that had been hewn\nentire out of masses of variegated clouds. So brilliantly were they\npolished, and so exquisitely wrought by the sculptor\u2019s skill, as to\nresemble the finest specimens of emerald, porphyry, opal, and\nchrysolite, thus producing a delicate richness of effect which their\nimmense size rendered not incompatible with grandeur. To each of these\npillars a meteor was suspended. Thousands of these ethereal lustres are\ncontinually wandering about the firmament, burning out to waste, yet\ncapable of imparting a useful radiance to any person who has the art of\nconverting them to domestic purposes. As managed in the saloon, they\nare far more economical than ordinary lamplight. Such, however, was the\nintensity of their blaze that it had been found expedient to cover each\nmeteor with a globe of evening mist, thereby muffling the too potent\nglow and soothing it into a mild and comfortable splendor. It was like\nthe brilliancy of a powerful yet chastened imagination,\u2014a light which\nseemed to hide whatever was unworthy to be noticed and give effect to\nevery beautiful and noble attribute. The guests, therefore, as they\nadvanced up the centre of the saloon, appeared to better advantage than\never before in their lives.\n\nThe first that entered, with old-fashioned punctuality, was a venerable\nfigure in the costume of bygone days, with his white hair flowing down\nover his shoulders and a reverend beard upon his breast. He leaned upon\na staff, the tremulous stroke of which, as he set it carefully upon the\nfloor, re-echoed through the saloon at every footstep. Recognizing at\nonce this celebrated personage, whom it had cost him a vast deal of\ntrouble and research to discover, the host advanced nearly three\nfourths of the distance down between the pillars to meet and welcome\nhim.\n\n\u201cVenerable sir,\u201d said the Man of Fancy, bending to the floor, \u201cthe\nhonor of this visit would never be forgotten were my term of existence\nto be as happily prolonged as your own.\u201d\n\nThe old gentleman received the compliment with gracious condescension.\nHe then thrust up his spectacles over his forehead and appeared to take\na critical survey of the saloon.\n\n\u201cNever within my recollection,\u201d observed he, \u201chave I entered a more\nspacious and noble hall. But are you sure that it is built of solid\nmaterials and that the structure will be permanent?\u201d\n\n\u201cO, never fear, my venerable friend,\u201d replied the host. \u201cIn reference\nto a lifetime like your own, it is true my castle may well be called a\ntemporary edifice. But it will endure long enough to answer all the\npurposes for which it was erected.\u201d\n\nBut we forget that the reader has not yet been made acquainted with the\nguest. It was no other than that universally accredited character so\nconstantly referred to in all seasons of intense cold or heat; he that,\nremembers the hot Sunday and the cold Friday; the witness of a past age\nwhose negative reminiscences find their way into every newspaper, yet\nwhose antiquated and dusky abode is so overshadowed by accumulated\nyears and crowded back by modern edifices that none but the Man of\nFancy could have discovered it; it was, in short, that twin brother of\nTime, and great-grandsire of mankind, and hand-and-glove associate of\nall forgotten men and things,\u2014the Oldest Inhabitant. The host would\nwillingly have drawn him into conversation, but succeeded only in\neliciting a few remarks as to the oppressive atmosphere of this present\nsummer evening compared with one which the guest had experienced about\nfourscore years ago. The old gentleman, in fact, was a good deal\novercome by his journey among the clouds, which, to a frame so\nearth-incrusted by long continuance in a lower region, was unavoidably\nmore fatiguing than to younger spirits. He was therefore conducted to\nan easy-chair, well cushioned and stuffed with vaporous softness, and\nleft to take a little repose.\n\nThe Man of Fancy now discerned another guest, who stood so quietly in\nthe shadow of one of the pillars that he might easily have been\noverlooked.\n\n\u201cMy dear sir,\u201d exclaimed the host, grasping him warmly by the hand,\n\u201callow me to greet you as the hero of the evening. Pray do not take it\nas an empty compliment; for, if there were not another guest in my\ncastle, it would be entirely pervaded with your presence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thank you,\u201d answered the unpretending stranger; \u201cbut, though you\nhappened to overlook me, I have not just arrived. I came very early;\nand, with your permission, shall remain after the rest of the company\nhave retired.\u201d\n\nAnd who does the reader imagine was this unobtrusive guest? It was the\nfamous performer of acknowledged impossibilities,\u2014a character of\nsuperhuman capacity and virtue, and, if his enemies are to be credited,\nof no less remarkable weaknesses and defects. With a generosity with\nwhich he alone sets us an example, we will glance merely at his nobler\nattributes. He it is, then, who prefers the interests of others to his\nown and a humble station to an exalted one. Careless of fashion,\ncustom, the opinions of men, and the influence of the press, he\nassimilates his life to the standard of ideal rectitude, and thus\nproves himself the one independent citizen of our free country. In\npoint of ability, many people declare him to be the only mathematician\ncapable of squaring the circle; the only mechanic acquainted with the\nprinciple of perpetual motion; the only scientific philosopher who can\ncompel water to run up hill; the only writer of the age whose genius is\nequal to the production of an epic poem; and, finally, so various are\nhis accomplishments, the only professor of gymnastics who has succeeded\nin jumping down his own throat. With all these talents, however, he is\nso far from being considered a member of good society, that it is the\nseverest censure of any fashionable assemblage to affirm that this\nremarkable individual was present. Public orators, lecturers, and\ntheatrical performers particularly eschew his company. For especial\nreasons, we are not at liberty to disclose his name, and shall mention\nonly one other trait,\u2014a most singular phenomenon in natural\nphilosophy,\u2014that, when he happens to cast his eyes upon a\nlooking-glass, he beholds Nobody reflected there!\n\nSeveral other guests now made their appearance; and among them,\nchattering with immense volubility, a brisk little gentleman of\nuniversal vogue in private society, and not unknown in the public\njournals under the title of Monsieur On-Dit. The name would seem to\nindicate a Frenchman; but, whatever be his country, he is thoroughly\nversed in all the languages of the day, and can express himself quite\nas much to the purpose in English as in any other tongue. No sooner\nwere the ceremonies of salutation over than this talkative little\nperson put his mouth to the host\u2019s ear and whispered three secrets of\nstate, an important piece of commercial intelligence, and a rich item\nof fashionable scandal. He then assured the Man of Fancy that he would\nnot fail to circulate in the society of the lower world a minute\ndescription of this magnificent castle in the air and of the\nfestivities at which he had the honor to be a guest. So saying,\nMonsieur On-Dit made his bow and hurried from one to another of the\ncompany, with all of whom he seemed to be acquainted and to possess\nsome topic of interest or amusement for every individual. Coming at\nlast to the Oldest Inhabitant, who was slumbering comfortably in the\neasy-chair, he applied his mouth to that venerable ear.\n\n\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d cried the old gentleman, starting from his nap and\nputting up his hand to serve the purpose of an ear-trumpet.\n\nMonsieur On-Dit bent forward again and repeated his communication.\n\n\u201cNever within my memory,\u201d exclaimed the Oldest Inhabitant, lifting his\nhands in astonishment, \u201chas so remarkable an incident been heard of.\u201d\n\nNow came in the Clerk of the Weather, who had been invited out of\ndeference to his official station, although the host was well aware\nthat his conversation was likely to contribute but little to the\ngeneral enjoyment. He soon, indeed, got into a corner with his\nacquaintance of long ago, the Oldest Inhabitant, and began to compare\nnotes with him in reference to the great storms, gales of wind, and\nother atmospherical facts that had occurred during a century past. It\nrejoiced the Man of Fancy that his venerable and much-respected guest\nhad met with so congenial an associate. Entreating them both to make\nthemselves perfectly at home, he now turned to receive the Wandering\nJew. This personage, however, had latterly grown so common, by mingling\nin all sorts of society and appearing at the beck of every entertainer,\nthat he could hardly be deemed a proper guest in a very exclusive\ncircle. Besides, being covered with dust from his continual wanderings\nalong the highways of the world, he really looked out of place in a\ndress party; so that the host felt relieved of an incommodity when the\nrestless individual in question, after a brief stay, took his departure\non a ramble towards Oregon.\n\nThe portal was now thronged by a crowd of shadowy people with whom the\nMan of Fancy had been acquainted in his visionary youth. He had invited\nthem hither for the sake of observing how they would compare, whether\nadvantageously or otherwise, with the real characters to whom his\nmaturer life had introduced him. They were beings of crude imagination,\nsuch as glide before a young man\u2019s eye and pretend to be actual\ninhabitants of the earth; the wise and witty with whom he would\nhereafter hold intercourse; the generous and heroic friends whose\ndevotion would be requited with his own; the beautiful dream-woman who\nwould become the helpmate of his human toils and sorrows and at once\nthe source and partaker of his happiness. Alas! it is not good for the\nfull-grown man to look too closely at these old acquaintances, but\nrather to reverence them at a distance through the medium of years that\nhave gathered duskily between. There was something laughably untrue in\ntheir pompous stride and exaggerated sentiment; they were neither human\nnor tolerable likenesses of humanity, but fantastic maskers, rendering\nheroism and nature alike ridiculous by the grave absurdity of their\npretensions to such attributes; and as for the peerless dream-lady,\nbehold! there advanced up the saloon, with a movement like a jointed\ndoll, a sort of wax-figure of an angel, a creature as cold as\nmoonshine, an artifice in petticoats, with an intellect of pretty\nphrases and only the semblance of a heart, yet in all these particulars\nthe true type of a young man\u2019s imaginary mistress. Hardly could the\nhost\u2019s punctilious courtesy restrain a smile as he paid his respects to\nthis unreality and met the sentimental glance with which the Dream\nsought to remind him of their former love passages.\n\n\u201cNo, no, fair lady,\u201d murmured he betwixt sighing and smiling; \u201cmy taste\nis changed; I have learned to love what Nature makes better than my own\ncreations in the guise of womanhood.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, false one,\u201d shrieked the dream-lady, pretending to faint, but\ndissolving into thin air, out of which came the deplorable murmur of\nher voice, \u201cyour inconstancy has annihilated me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo be it,\u201d said the cruel Man of Fancy to himself; \u201cand a good\nriddance too.\u201d\n\nTogether with these shadows, and from the same region, there came an\nuninvited multitude of shapes which at any time during his life had\ntormented the Man of Fancy in his moods of morbid melancholy or had\nhaunted him in the delirium of fever. The walls of his castle in the\nair were not dense enough to keep them out, nor would the strongest of\nearthly architecture have availed to their exclusion. Here were those\nforms of dim terror which had beset him at the entrance of life, waging\nwarfare with his hopes; here were strange uglinesses of earlier date,\nsuch as haunt children in the night-time. He was particularly startled\nby the vision of a deformed old black woman whom he imagined as lurking\nin the garret of his native home, and who, when he was an infant, had\nonce come to his bedside and grinned at him in the crisis of a scarlet\nfever. This same black shadow, with others almost as hideous, now\nglided among the pillars of the magnificent saloon, grinning\nrecognition, until the man shuddered anew at the forgotten terrors of\nhis childhood. It amused him, however, to observe the black woman, with\nthe mischievous caprice peculiar to such beings, steal up to the chair\nof the Oldest Inhabitant and peep into his half-dreamy mind.\n\n\u201cNever within my memory,\u201d muttered that venerable personage, aghast,\n\u201cdid I see such a face.\u201d\n\nAlmost immediately after the unrealities just described, arrived a\nnumber of guests whom incredulous readers may be inclined to rank\nequally among creatures of imagination. The most noteworthy were an\nincorruptible Patriot; a Scholar without pedantry; a Priest without\nworldly ambition; and a Beautiful Woman without pride or coquetry; a\nMarried Pair whose life had never been disturbed by incongruity of\nfeeling; a Reformer untrammelled by his theory; and a Poet who felt no\njealousy towards other votaries of the lyre. In truth, however, the\nhost was not one of the cynics who consider these patterns of\nexcellence, without the fatal flaw, such rarities in the world; and he\nhad invited them to his select party chiefly out of humble deference to\nthe judgment of society, which pronounces them almost impossible to be\nmet with.\n\n\u201cIn my younger days,\u201d observed the Oldest Inhabitant, \u201csuch characters\nmight be seen at the corner of every street.\u201d\n\nBe that as it might, these specimens of perfection proved to be not\nhalf so entertaining companions as people with the ordinary allowance\nof faults.\n\nBut now appeared a stranger, whom the host had no sooner recognized\nthan, with an abundance of courtesy unlavished on any other, he\nhastened down the whole length of the saloon in order to pay him\nemphatic honor. Yet he was a young man in poor attire, with no insignia\nof rank or acknowledged eminence, nor anything to distinguish him among\nthe crowd except a high, white forehead, beneath which a pair of\ndeep-set eyes were glowing with warm light. It was such a light as\nnever illuminates the earth save when a great heart burns as the\nhousehold fire of a grand intellect. And who was he?\u2014who but the Master\nGenius for whom our country is looking anxiously into the mist of Time,\nas destined to fulfil the great mission of creating an American\nliterature, hewing it, as it were, out of the unwrought granite of our\nintellectual quarries? From him, whether moulded in the form of an epic\npoem or assuming a guise altogether new as the spirit itself may\ndetermine, we are to receive our first great original work, which shall\ndo all that remains to be achieved for our glory among the nations. How\nthis child of a mighty destiny had been discovered by the Man of Fancy\nit is of little consequence to mention. Suffice it that he dwells as\nyet unhonored among men, unrecognized by those who have known him from\nhis cradle; the noble countenance which should be distinguished by a\nhalo diffused around it passes daily amid the throng of people toiling\nand troubling themselves about the trifles of a moment, and none pay\nreverence to the worker of immortality. Nor does it matter much to him,\nin his triumph over all the ages, though a generation or two of his own\ntimes shall do themselves the wrong to disregard him.\n\nBy this time Monsieur On-Dit had caught up the stranger\u2019s name and\ndestiny and was busily whispering the intelligence among the other\nguests.\n\n\u201cPshaw!\u201d said one. \u201cThere can never be an American genius.\u201d\n\n\u201cPish!\u201d cried another. \u201cWe have already as good poets as any in the\nworld. For my part, I desire to see no better.\u201d\n\nAnd the Oldest Inhabitant, when it was proposed to introduce him to the\nMaster Genius, begged to be excused, observing that a man who had been\nhonored with the acquaintance of Dwight, and Freneau, and Joel Barlow,\nmight be allowed a little austerity of taste.\n\nThe saloon was now fast filling up by the arrival of other remarkable\ncharacters, among whom were noticed Davy Jones, the distinguished\nnautical personage, and a rude, carelessly dressed, harum-scarum sort\nof elderly fellow, known by the nickname of Old Harry. The latter,\nhowever, after being shown to a dressing-room, reappeared with his gray\nhair nicely combed, his clothes brushed, a clean dicky on his neck, and\naltogether so changed in aspect as to merit the more respectful\nappellation of Venerable Henry. Joel Doe and Richard Roe came arm in\narm, accompanied by a Man of Straw, a fictitious indorser, and several\npersons who had no existence except as voters in closely contested\nelections. The celebrated Seatsfield, who now entered, was at first\nsupposed to belong to the same brotherhood, until he made it apparent\nthat he was a real man of flesh and blood and had his earthly domicile\nin Germany. Among the latest comers, as might reasonably be expected,\narrived a guest from the far future.\n\n\u201cDo you know him? do you know him?\u201d whispered Monsieur On-Dit, who\nseemed to be acquainted with everybody. \u201cHe is the representative of\nPosterity,\u2014the man of an age to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how came he here?\u201d asked a figure who was evidently the prototype\nof the fashion-plate in a magazine, and might be taken to represent the\nvanities of the passing moment. \u201cThe fellow infringes upon our rights\nby coming before his time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you forget where we are,\u201d answered the Man of Fancy, who overheard\nthe remark. \u201cThe lower earth, it is true, will be forbidden ground to\nhim for many long years hence; but a castle in the air is a sort of\nno-man\u2019s-land, where Posterity may make acquaintance with us on equal\nterms.\u201d\n\nNo sooner was his identity known than a throng of guests gathered about\nPosterity, all expressing the most generous interest in his welfare,\nand many boasting of the sacrifices which they had made, or were\nwilling to make, in his behalf. Some, with as much secrecy as possible,\ndesired his judgment upon certain copies of verses or great manuscript\nrolls of prose; others accosted him with the familiarity of old\nfriends, taking it for granted that he was perfectly cognizant of their\nnames and characters. At length, finding himself thus beset, Posterity\nwas put quite beside his patience.\n\n\u201cGentlemen, my good friends,\u201d cried he, breaking loose from a misty\npoet who strove to hold him by the button, \u201cI pray you to attend to\nyour own business, and leave me to take care of mine! I expect to owe\nyou nothing, unless it be certain national debts, and other\nencumbrances and impediments, physical and moral, which I shall find it\ntroublesome enough to remove from my path. As to your verses, pray read\nthem to your contemporaries. Your names are as strange to me as your\nfaces; and even were it otherwise,\u2014let me whisper you a secret,\u2014the\ncold, icy memory which one generation may retain of another is but a\npoor recompense to barter life for. Yet, if your heart is set on being\nknown to me, the surest, the only method is, to live truly and wisely\nfor your own age, whereby, if the native force be in you, you may\nlikewise live for posterity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is nonsense,\u201d murmured the Oldest Inhabitant, who, as a man of the\npast, felt jealous that all notice should be withdrawn from himself to\nbe lavished on the future, \u201csheer nonsense, to waste so much thought on\nwhat only is to be.\u201d\n\nTo divert the minds of his guests, who were considerably abashed by\nthis little incident, the Man of Fancy led them through several\napartments of the castle, receiving their compliments upon the taste\nand varied magnificence that were displayed in each. One of these rooms\nwas filled with moonlight, which did not enter through the window, but\nwas the aggregate of all the moonshine that is scattered around the\nearth on a summer night while no eyes are awake to enjoy its beauty.\nAiry spirits had gathered it up, wherever they found it gleaming on the\nbroad bosom of a lake, or silvering the meanders of a stream, or\nglimmering among the wind-stirred boughs of a wood, and had garnered it\nin this one spacious hall. Along the walls, illuminated by the mild\nintensity of the moonshine, stood a multitude of ideal statues, the\noriginal conceptions of the great works of ancient or modern art, which\nthe sculptors did but imperfectly succeed in putting into marble; for\nit is not to be supposed that the pure idea of an immortal creation\nceases to exist; it is only necessary to know where they are deposited\nin order to obtain possession of them.\u2014In the alcoves of another vast\napartment was arranged a splendid library, the volumes of which were\ninestimable, because they consisted, not of actual performances, but of\nthe works which the authors only planned, without ever finding the\nhappy season to achieve them. To take familiar instances, here were the\nuntold tales of Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Pilgrims; the unwritten cantos of\nthe Fairy Queen; the conclusion of Coleridge\u2019s Christabel; and the\nwhole of Dryden\u2019s projected epic on the subject of King Arthur. The\nshelves were crowded; for it would not be too much to affirm that every\nauthor has imagined and shaped out in his thought more and far better\nworks than those which actually proceeded from his pen. And here,\nlikewise, where the unrealized conceptions of youthful poets who died\nof the very strength of their own genius before the world had caught\none inspired murmur from their lips.\n\nWhen the peculiarities of the library and statue-gallery were explained\nto the Oldest Inhabitant, he appeared infinitely perplexed, and\nexclaimed, with more energy than usual, that he had never heard of such\na thing within his memory, and, moreover, did not at all understand how\nit could be.\n\n\u201cBut my brain, I think,\u201d said the good old gentleman, \u201cis getting not\nso clear as it used to be. You young folks, I suppose, can see your way\nthrough these strange matters. For my part, I give it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so do I,\u201d muttered the Old Harry. \u201cIt is enough to puzzle\nthe\u2014Ahem!\u201d\n\nMaking as little reply as possible to these observations, the Man of\nFancy preceded the company to another noble saloon, the pillars of\nwhich were solid golden sunbeams taken out of the sky in the first hour\nin the morning. Thus, as they retained all their living lustre, the\nroom was filled with the most cheerful radiance imaginable, yet not too\ndazzling to be borne with comfort and delight. The windows were\nbeautifully adorned with curtains made of the many-colored clouds of\nsunrise, all imbued with virgin light, and hanging in magnificent\nfestoons from the ceiling to the floor. Moreover, there were fragments\nof rainbows scattered through the room; so that the guests, astonished\nat one another, reciprocally saw their heads made glorious by the seven\nprimary hues; or, if they chose,\u2014as who would not?\u2014they could grasp a\nrainbow in the air and convert it to their own apparel and adornment.\nBut the morning light and scattered rainbows were only a type and\nsymbol of the real wonders of the apartment. By an influence akin to\nmagic, yet perfectly natural, whatever means and opportunities of joy\nare neglected in the lower world had been carefully gathered up and\ndeposited in the saloon of morning sunshine. As may well be conceived,\ntherefore, there was material enough to supply, not merely a joyous\nevening, but also a happy lifetime, to more than as many people as that\nspacious apartment could contain. The company seemed to renew their\nyouth; while that pattern and proverbial standard of innocence, the\nChild Unborn, frolicked to and fro among them, communicating his own\nunwrinkled gayety to all who had the good fortune to witness his\ngambols.\n\n\u201cMy honored friends,\u201d said the Man of Fancy, after they had enjoyed\nthemselves awhile, \u201cI am now to request your presence in the\nbanqueting-hall, where a slight collation is awaiting you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, well said!\u201d ejaculated a cadaverous figure, who had been invited\nfor no other reason than that he was pretty constantly in the habit of\ndining with Duke Humphrey. \u201cI was beginning to wonder whether a castle\nin the air were provided with a kitchen.\u201d\n\nIt was curious, in truth, to see how instantaneously the guests were\ndiverted from the high moral enjoyments which they had been tasting\nwith so much apparent zest by a suggestion of the more solid as well as\nliquid delights of the festive board. They thronged eagerly in the rear\nof the host, who now ushered them into a lofty and extensive hall, from\nend to end of which was arranged a table, glittering all over with\ninnumerable dishes and drinking-vessels of gold. It is an uncertain\npoint whether these rich articles of plate were made for the occasion\nout of molten sunbeams, or recovered from the wrecks of Spanish\ngalleons that had lain for ages at the bottom of the sea. The upper end\nof the table was overshadowed by a canopy, beneath which was placed a\nchair of elaborate magnificence, which the host himself declined to\noccupy, and besought his guests to assign it to the worthiest among\nthem. As a suitable homage to his incalculable antiquity and eminent\ndistinction, the post of honor was at first tendered to the Oldest\nInhabitant. He, however, eschewed it, and requested the favor of a bowl\nof gruel at a side table, where he could refresh himself with a quiet\nnap. There was some little hesitation as to the next candidate, until\nPosterity took the Master Genius of our country by the hand and led him\nto the chair of state beneath the princely canopy. When once they\nbeheld him in his true place, the company acknowledged the justice of\nthe selection by a long thunder-roll of vehement applause.\n\nThen was served up a banquet, combining, if not all the delicacies of\nthe season, yet all the rarities which careful purveyors had met with\nin the flesh, fish, and vegetable markets of the land of Nowhere. The\nbill of fare being unfortunately lost, we can only mention a phoenix,\nroasted in its own flames, cold potted birds of paradise, ice-creams\nfrom the Milky-Way, and whip syllabubs and flummery from the Paradise\nof Fools, whereof there was a very great consumption. As for\ndrinkables, the temperance people contented themselves with water as\nusual; but it was the water of the Fountain of Youth; the ladies sipped\nNepenthe; the lovelorn, the careworn, and the sorrow-stricken were\nsupplied with brimming goblets of Lethe; and it was shrewdly\nconjectured that a certain golden vase, from which only the more\ndistinguished guests were invited to partake, contained nectar that had\nbeen mellowing ever since the days of classical mythology. The cloth\nbeing removed, the company, as usual, grew eloquent over their liquor\nand delivered themselves of a succession of brilliant speeches,\u2014the\ntask of reporting which we resign to the more adequate ability of\nCounsellor Gill, whose indispensable co-operation the Man of Fancy had\ntaken the precaution to secure.\n\nWhen the festivity of the banquet was at its most ethereal point, the\nClerk of the Weather was observed to steal from the table and thrust\nhis head between the purple and golden curtains of one of the windows.\n\n\u201cMy fellow-guests,\u201d he remarked aloud, after carefully noting the signs\nof the night, \u201cI advise such of you as live at a distance to be going\nas soon as possible; for a thunder-storm is certainly at hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cMercy on me!\u201d cried Mother Carey, who had left her brood of chickens\nand come hither in gossamer drapery, with pink silk stockings. \u201cHow\nshall I ever get home?\u201d\n\nAll now was confusion and hasty departure, with but little superfluous\nleave-taking. The Oldest Inhabitant, however, true to the rule of those\nlong past days in which his courtesy had been studied, paused on the\nthreshold of the meteor-lighted hall to express his vast satisfaction\nat the entertainment.\n\n\u201cNever, within my memory,\u201d observed the gracious old gentleman, \u201chas it\nbeen my good fortune to spend a pleasanter evening or in more select\nsociety.\u201d\n\nThe wind here took his breath away, whirled his three-cornered hat into\ninfinite space, and drowned what further compliments it had been his\npurpose to bestow. Many of the company had bespoken will-o\u2019-the-wisps\nto convoy them home; and the host, in his general beneficence, had\nengaged the Man in the Moon, with an immense horn-lantern, to be the\nguide of such desolate spinsters as could do no better for themselves.\nBut a blast of the rising tempest blew out all their lights in the\ntwinkling of an eye. How, in the darkness that ensued, the guests\ncontrived to get back to earth, or whether the greater part of them\ncontrived to get back at all, or are still wandering among clouds,\nmists, and puffs of tempestuous wind, bruised by the beams and rafters\nof the overthrown castle in the air, and deluded by all sorts of\nunrealities, are points that concern themselves much more than the\nwriter or the public. People should think of these matters before they\ntrust themselves on a pleasure-party into the realm of Nowhere.",
