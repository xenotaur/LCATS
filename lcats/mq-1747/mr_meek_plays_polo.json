    "body": "The sign read:\n\n                    _Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted\n                    Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes\n                    Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out!_\n\nIt added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering:\n\n                          _We Fix Anything._\n\nMr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm\nattached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was\nwired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was\nfaint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed\nspectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl:\n\n                       ASK ABOUT EDUCATED BUGS\n\nA bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from\nthe sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was\nindicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of\ncomparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance\nfar beyond its size.\n\nThe slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even\nless. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of\nalmost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek\nrealized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's\nsake was still a long way off.\n\nOne of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.\nThe other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its\nentrance lock, was the _Saturn Inn_.\n\nThe rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had\nleveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\nTwo ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair\nshop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare\nDepartment, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.\nThe Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,\nMeek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a\npuzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure\nout what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the\nSolar System.\n\nSlowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once\nor twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his\ncumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to\nnon-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and\nremember where he was.\n\nBehind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged\nball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched\nwith angry, bright green patches.\n\nTo right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that\nmade up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to\nSaturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he\nimmediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of\nspace, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and\nas he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out\nwith a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to\nthink of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\nReaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to\nkeep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock\nspun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance\nvault and stepped into the office.\n\nA dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the\ndesk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\nMeek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity\nunder him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his\nshoulders.\n\n\"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic.\n\n\n\nThe mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no\nbe-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and\nstuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.\nHis blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.\nEven the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and\nslight frame.\n\nThe mechanic said nothing.\n\nMeek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So\nI....\"\n\nThe mechanic shook himself.\n\n\"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What\nyou got?\"\n\nHe swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than\ndust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\nHe fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps\nin clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.\nLots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\nMeek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a\npuncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\nThe mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to\nbring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a\nnavigator.\"\n\n\"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\nThe mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in\nalone? No one with you?\"\n\nMeek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\nThe mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,\nmister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot\nthat ever took to space.\"\n\n\"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up\nuntil just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar\nExports.\"\n\n\"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a\nship like that?\"\n\n\"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\"You learned it?\"\n\n\"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to\nsee the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\nDazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the\ndesk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have\nto wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you\ngo over to the _Inn_. Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering\nabout. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe\nbelong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus\ntook over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they\nsure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to\nfigure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even\nworse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up\nsides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it\nfigured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing\nabout them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.\nGus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks\nmaybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe\nit crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the\nRing. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They\ncome along with it, see.\"\n\n\"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I\nfind him?\"\n\n\"Go over to the _Inn_ and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll\ncome in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his\nrheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a\ndaily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all\nhe reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\"\n\n\n                                  II\n\nMoe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced\nhis chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog\nlook. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming\nin big batches.\n\n\"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The\nboys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't\nworth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\nHenrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare\ndepartment of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of\nanything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they\nlive in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some\nrivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...\nalthough they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them\nget killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if\nsome of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud\nof theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven\ndidn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to\nhave somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare\nlady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get\nthem to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and\ndisturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\nShe missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed\nPete with the deuces wild.\"\n\nThe inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited\nfigure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush\nof grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\nIt was Gus Hamilton.\n\nHe glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he\ndemanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be\nimportant.\"\n\nHe hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward\nhim, keeping out of reach.\n\n\"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's\ngoing to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out\nof my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know\nwho it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector\nwill fit.\"\n\n\"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors\nof the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven\nand yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\nHe took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\nHis eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\"Revenuer?\"\n\n\"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says\nthere ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting\nwith the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\nGus stared in disbelief.\n\nMoe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\nGus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace\nparleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been\nripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled\ndown. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It\nwon't do you any good.\"\n\n\"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,\nbesides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off\nBud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\nGus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds\ninto healthy competition.\"\n\n\"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we\ncould fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at\nfifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\"\n\n\n\nGus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he\ndenied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I\nwas thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.\nRead about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to\nsee a game, but never did.\"\n\nMiss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the\nspaceships to play it with.\"\n\nMoe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you\ninto it.\"\n\n\"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't\nshe. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best\nsociety.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would\nplay it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be\none of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,\nonce you got him in the open.\"\n\nMiss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates\nyou guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would\njust naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't\nplay polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you\nring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split\nwide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\nThe inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,\nthat is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to\nthis man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\nThe man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white\nhair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert\npiloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You\nthink of everything.\"\n\n\"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation\nmoss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one\non you.\"\n\n\"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.\nDrove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any\nkind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you\nto death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another\nrock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure\nand simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to\neat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\nMeek looked crestfallen.\n\n\"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let\nyou have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\"Stilts?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.\nSeem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you\nwant to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\nMeek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a\nplace where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper.\n\n\n                                  III\n\nThe bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese\nchecker board, and now were settling down into their respective places\npreparatory to the start of another game.\n\nFor a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus\nHamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one\ndifferent, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\nOliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of\nrock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of\nstone that jutted from the surface.\n\nEven in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes\non stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and\npractically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek\nknew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was\nample proof of that.\n\nComfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the\npouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping\nthe pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\nNone of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three\nother boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing\nout the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.\nWhich, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been\nreached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\nBut so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not\neven a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\nThe whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.\nThe whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of\na moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\nSaturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with\ndeadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a\ndistance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,\nwhere they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered\nthem out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation\nmoss.\n\nOne of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the\nmoss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,\non kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had\nbeen analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,\nbut there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that\ncould not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still\nwilted and died.\n\nAnd because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because\nit would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted\non the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men\nlike Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their\norbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured\nloneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when\nrickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the\nmockery of space before them.\n\nMeek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself.\n\n\n\nThe bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,\nwatching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\nCrawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly\npopping in and out of holes.\n\nIf there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have\nto be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek\nadmitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or\nrecognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each\nside.\n\nSuddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of\nthe bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.\nThen, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they\nwere on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,\ngoing back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\nJust as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical\nproblem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from\nthere.\n\n\"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\nMeek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly\non the rock below.\n\nA mathematical problem!\n\nHis breath gurgled in his throat.\n\nHe knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic\nhad talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had\nthrown him off.\n\nGames! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving\nmathematical equations!\n\nMeek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the\nstilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He\ndropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\nThe other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly\ndownward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his\nbalance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he\nwas falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\nHe pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.\nHe struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\nOn the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny\nprojection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\nSomething scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand\nbefore him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\nFumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot\nout into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of\nHamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\nOliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself.\n\n\n\nGus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic\nscurrying within it.\n\n\"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and\ndump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it\nwasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did\nhave a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked\nhim. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the\nwelfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on\nthick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and\nall that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\nHe shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be\nthe same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being\npolite to one another.\"\n\n\"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\nMeek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands\nand knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\nGus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug\ninside.\n\n\"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better\ntake another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right\ninto solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest\ncusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\nThe radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning\nin on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's\nbiggest moon.\n\nThe syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with\nexcitement and pride.\n\n\"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be\nplayed at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers\ntonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the\nsporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\nHe paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with\ndelight.\n\n\"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and\ndown the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here\nin our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two\nunknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the\nmen have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a\ngame. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what\nit was.\n\n\"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks\nthat make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety\nships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it\nout, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort\nof tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in\nthe Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten\nso it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when\nmen from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the\nfeud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the\nfeud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner\nRing go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space\npolo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy\nof one of the two sectors.\"\n\n\n\nMeek rose from his chair, opened his mouth as if to speak, but sank\nback again when Gus hissed at him and held a finger to his lips for\nsilence.\n\n\"The teams are now in training,\" went on the newscaster, the happy\nlilt in his voice still undimmed, \"and it is understood that sector\nTwenty-three has the advantage, at the start at least, of having a polo\nexpert as its coach. Just who this expert is no one can say. Several\nnames have been mentioned, but....\"\n\n\"No, no,\" yelped Meek, struggling to his feet, but Gus shushed him,\npoking a finger toward him and grinning like a bearded imp.\n\n\"... Bets are mounting high throughout the entire Saturnian system,\"\nthe announcer was saying, \"but since little is known about the teams,\nthe odds still are even. It is likely, however, that odds will be\ndemanded on the sector of Thirty-seven team on the basis of the story\nabout the expert coach.\n\n\"The very audacity of such a game has attracted solar-wide attention\nand special fleets of ships will leave both Earth and Mars within the\nnext few days to bring spectators to the game. Newsmen from the inner\nworlds, among them some of the system's most famous sports writers, are\nalready on their way.\n\n\"Originally intended to be no more than a recreation project under the\nsupervision of the department of health and welfare, the game has\nsuddenly become a solar attraction. The _Daily Rocket_ back on Earth is\noffering a gigantic loving cup for the winning team, while the _Morning\nSpaceways_ has provided another loving cup, only slightly smaller, to\nbe presented the player adjudged the most valuable to his team. We may\nhave more to tell you about the game before the newscast is over, but\nin the meantime we shall go on to other news of Solar int....\"\n\nMeek leaped up. \"He meant me,\" he whooped. \"That was me he meant when\nhe was talking about a famous coach!\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Gus. \"He couldn't have meant anyone else but you.\"\n\n\"But I'm not a famous coach,\" protested Meek. \"I'm not even a coach at\nall. I never saw but one space polo game in all my life. I hardly know\nhow it's played. I just know you go up there in space and bat a ball\naround. I'm going to....\"\n\n\"You ain't going to do a blessed thing,\" said Gus. \"You ain't skipping\nout on us. You're staying right here and give us all the fine pointers\nof the game. Maybe you ain't as hot as the newscaster made out, but\nyou're a dang sight better than anyone else around here. At least you\nseen a game once and that's more than any of the rest of us have.\"\n\n\"But I....\"\n\n\"I don't know what's the matter with you,\" declared Gus. \"You're just\npretending you don't know anything about polo, that's all. Maybe you're\na fugitive from justice. Maybe that's why you're so anxious to make\na getaway. Only reason you stopped at all was because your ship got\nstoved up.\"\n\n\"I'm no fugitive,\" declared Meek, drawing himself up. \"I'm just a\nbookkeeper out to see the system.\"\n\n\"Forget it,\" said Gus. \"Forget it. Nobody around here's going to give\nyou away. If they even so much as peep, I'll plain paralyze them. So\nyou're a bookkeeper. That's good enough for me. Just let anyone say you\nain't a bookkeeper and see what happens to him.\"\n\nMeek opened his mouth to speak, closed it again. What was the use?\nHere he was, stuck again. Just like back on Juno when that preacher\nhad thought he was a gunman and talked him into taking over the job of\ncleaning up the town. Only this time it was a space polo game and he\nknew even less about space polo than he did about being a lawman.\n\nGus rose and limped slowly across the room. Ponderously, he hauled a\nred bandanna out of his back pocket and carefully dusted off the one\nuncrowded space on the mantel shelf, between the alarm clock and the\ntarnished silver model of a rocket ship.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he said, \"she'll look right pretty there.\"\n\nHe backed away and stared at the place on the shelf.\n\n\"I can almost see her now,\" he said. \"Glinting in the lamplight.\nSomething to keep me company. Something to look at when I get lonesome.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" demanded Meek.\n\n\"That there cup the radio was talking about,\" said Gus. \"The one for\nthe most valuable team member.\"\n\nMeek stammered. \"But ... but....\"\n\n\"I'm going to win her,\" Gus declared.\n\n\n                                  IV\n\nSaturn Inn bulged. Every room was crowded, with half a dozen to the\ncubicle, sleeping in relays. Those who couldn't find anywhere else to\nsleep spread blankets in the narrow corridors or dozed off in chairs or\nslept on the barroom floor. A few of them got stepped on.\n\nTitan City's Junior Chamber of Commerce had done what it could to help\nthe situation out, but the notice had been short. A half-dozen nearby\nrocks which had been hastily leveled off for parking space, now were\njammed with hundreds of space vehicles, ranging from the nifty two man\njob owned by Billy Jones, sports editor of the _Daily Rocket_, to the\nhuge excursion liners sent out by the three big transport companies.\nA few hastily-erected shelters helped out to some extent, but none of\nthese shelters had a bar and were mostly untenanted.\n\nMoe, the bartender at the Inn, harried with too many customers, droopy\nwith lack of sleep, saw Oliver Meek bobbing around in the crowd that\nsurged against the bar, much after the manner of a cork caught in a\nraging whirlpool. He reached out a hand and dragged Meek against the\nbar.\n\n\"Can't you do something to stop it?\"\n\nMeek blinked at him. \"Stop what?\"\n\n\"This game,\" said Moe. \"It's awful, Mr. Meek. Honestly. The crowd has\ngot the fellers so worked up, it's apt to be mass murder.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" Meek agreed, \"but you can't stop it now. The Junior\nChamber of Commerce would take the hide off anyone who even said he\nwould like to see it stopped. It's more publicity than Saturn has\ngotten since the first expeditions were lost here.\"\n\n\"I don't like it,\" declared Moe, stolidly.\n\n\"I don't like it either,\" Meek confessed. \"Gus and those other fellows\non his team think I'm an expert. I told them what I knew about space\npolo, but it wasn't much. Trouble is they think it's everything\nthere is to know. They figure they're a cinch to win and they got\ntheir shirts bet on the game. If they lose, they'll more than likely\nspace-walk me.\"\n\nFingers tapped Meek's shoulders and he twisted around. A red face\nloomed above him, a cigarette drooping from the corner of its lips.\n\n\"Hear you say you was coaching the Twenty-three bunch?\"\n\nMeek gulped.\n\n\"Billy Jones, that's me,\" said the lips with the cigarette. \"Best damn\nsports writer ever pounded keys. Been trying to find out who you was.\nNobody else knows. Treat you right.\"\n\n\"You must be wrong,\" said Meek.\n\n\"Never wrong,\" insisted Jones. \"Nose for news. Smell it out. Like this.\n_Sniff. Sniff._\"\n\nHis nose crinkled in imitation of a bloodhound, but his face didn't\nchange otherwise. The cigarette still dangled, pouring smoke into a\nwatery left eye.\n\n\"Heard the guy call you Meek,\" said Jones. \"Name sounds familiar.\nSomething about Juno, wasn't it? Rounded up a bunch of crooks. Found a\nspace monster of some sort.\"\n\nAnother hand gripped Meek by the shoulder and literally jerked him\naround.\n\n\"So you're the guy!\" yelped the owner of the hand. \"I been looking for\nyou. I've a good notion to smack you in the puss.\"\n\n\"Now, Bud,\" yelled Moe, in mounting fear, \"you leave him alone. He\nain't done a thing.\"\n\nMeek gaped at the angry face of the hulking man, who still had his\nshoulder in the grip of a monstrous paw.\n\nBud Craney! The ring-rat that had stolen Gus' injector! The captain of\nthe Thirty-seven team.\n\n\"If there was room,\" Craney grated, \"I'd wipe up the floor with you.\nBut since there ain't, I'm just plain going to hammer you down about\nhalfway into it.\"\n\n\"But he ain't done nothing!\" shrilled Moe.\n\n\"He's an outsider, ain't he?\" demanded Craney. \"What business he got\ncoming in here and messing around with things?\"\n\n\"I'm not messing around with things, Mr. Craney,\" Meek declared, trying\nto be dignified about it. But it was hard to be dignified with someone\nlifting one by the shoulder so one's toes just barely touched the floor.\n\n\"All that's the matter with you,\" insisted the dangling Meek, \"is that\nyou know Gus and his men will give you a whipping. They'd done it,\nanyhow. I haven't helped them much. I haven't helped them hardly at\nall.\"\n\nCraney howled in rage. \"Why ... you ... you....\"\n\nAnd then Oliver Meek did one of those things no one ever expected him\nto do, least of all himself.\n\n\"I'll bet you my spaceship,\" he said, \"against anything you got.\"\n\nAstonished, Craney opened his hand and let him down on the floor.\n\n\"You'll what?\" he roared.\n\n\"I'll bet you my spaceship,\" said Meek, the madness still upon him,\n\"that Twenty-three will beat you.\"\n\nHe rubbed it in. \"I'll even give you odds.\"\n\nCraney gasped and sputtered. \"I don't want any odds,\" he yelped. \"I'll\ntake it even. My moss patch against your ship.\"\n\nSomeone was calling Meek's name in the crowd.\n\n\"Mr. Meek! Mr. Meek!\"\n\n\"Here,\" said Meek.\n\n\"What about that story?\" demanded Billy Jones, but Meek didn't hear him.\n\nA man was tearing his way through the crowd. It was one of the men from\nTwenty-three.\n\n\"Mr. Meek,\" he panted, \"you got to come right away. It's Gus. He's all\ntangled up with rheumatiz!\"\n\n\n\nGus stared up with anguished eyes at Meek.\n\n\"It sneaked up on me while I slept,\" he squeaked. \"Laid off of me for\nyears until just now. Limped once in a while, of course, and got a few\ntwinges now and then, but that was all. Never had me tied up like this\nsince I left Earth. One of the reasons I never did go back to Earth.\nSpace is good climate for rheumatiz. Cold but dry. No moisture to get\ninto your bones.\"\n\nMeek looked around at the huddled men, saw the worry that was etched\nupon their faces.\n\n\"Get a hot water bottle,\" he told one of them.\n\n\"Hell,\" said Russ Jensen, a hulking framed spaceman, \"there ain't no\nsuch a thing as a hot water bottle nearer than Titan City.\"\n\n\"An electric pad, then.\"\n\nJensen shook his head. \"No pads, neither. Only thing we can do is pour\nwhiskey down him and if we pour enough down him to cure the rheumatiz,\nwe'll get him drunk and he won't be no more able to play in that game\nthan he is right now.\"\n\nMeek's weak eyes blinked behind his glasses, staring at Gus.\n\n\"We'll lose sure if Gus can't play,\" said Jensen, \"and me with\neverything I got bet on our team.\"\n\nAnother man spoke up. \"Meek could play in Gus' place.\"\n\n\"Nope, he couldn't,\" declared Jensen. \"The rats from Thirty-seven\nwouldn't stand for it.\"\n\n\"They couldn't do a thing about it,\" declared the other man. \"Meek's\nbeen here six weeks today. That makes him a resident. Six Earth weeks,\nthe law says. And all that time he's been in sector Twenty-three. They\nwouldn't have a leg to stand on. They might squawk but they couldn't\nmake it stick.\"\n\n\"You're certain of that?\" demanded Jensen.\n\n\"Dead certain,\" said the other.\n\nMeek saw them looking at him, felt a queasy feeling steal into his\nstomach.\n\n\"I couldn't,\" he told them. \"I couldn't do it. I ... I....\"\n\n\"You go right ahead, Oliver,\" said Gus. \"I wanted to play, of course.\nSort of set my heart on that cup. Had the mantel piece all dusted off\nfor it. But if I can't play, there ain't another soul I'd rather have\nplay in my place than you.\"\n\n\"But I don't know a thing about polo,\" protested Meek.\n\n\"You taught it to us, didn't you?\" bellowed Jensen. \"You pretended like\nyou knew everything there was to know.\"\n\n\"But I don't,\" insisted Meek. \"You wouldn't let me explain. You kept\ntelling me all the time what a swell coach I was and when I tried to\nargue with you and tell you that I wasn't you yelled me down. I never\nsaw more than one game in all my life and the only reason I saw it then\nwas because I found the ticket. It was on the sidewalk and I picked it\nup. Somebody had dropped it.\"\n\n\"So you been stringing us along,\" yelped Jensen. \"You been making fools\nof us! How do we know but you showed us wrong. You been giving us the\nwrong dope.\"\n\nHe advanced on Meek and Meek backed against the wall.\n\nJensen lifted his fist, held it in front of him as if he were weighing\nit.\n\n\"I ought to bop you one,\" he decided. \"All of us had ought to bop you\none. Every danged man in this here room has got his shirt bet on the\ngame because we figured we couldn't lose with a coach like you.\"\n\n\"So have I,\" said Meek. But it wasn't until he said it that he really\nrealized he did have his shirt bet on Twenty-three. His spaceship. It\nwasn't all he had, of course, but it was the thing that was nearest to\nhis heart ... the thing he had slaved for thirty years to buy.\n\nHe suddenly remembered those years now. Years of bending over account\nbooks in the dingy office back on Earth, watching other men go out in\nspace, longing to go himself. Counting pennies so that he could go.\nSpending only a dime for lunch and eating crackers and cheese instead\nof going out for dinner in the evening. Piling up the dollars, slowly\nthrough the years ... dollars to buy the ship that now stood out on\nthe field, all damage repaired. Sitting, poised for space.\n\nBut if Thirty-seven won it wouldn't be his any longer. It would be\nCraney's. He'd just made a bet with Craney and there were plenty of\nwitnesses to back it up.\n\n\"Well?\" demanded Jensen.\n\n\"I will play,\" said Meek.\n\n\"And you really know about the game? You wasn't kidding us?\"\n\nMeek looked at the men before him and the expression on their faces\nshaped his answer.\n\nHe gulped ... gulped again. Then slowly nodded.\n\n\"Sure, I know about it,\" he lied.\n\nThey didn't look quite satisfied.\n\nHe glanced around, but there was no way of escape. He faced them again,\nback pressed against the wall.\n\nHe tried to make his voice light and breezy, but he couldn't quite keep\nout the croak.\n\n\"Haven't played it much in the last few years,\" he said, \"but back when\nI was a kid I was a ten-goal man.\"\n\nThey were satisfied at that.\n\n\n                                   V\n\nHunched behind the controls, Meek slowly circled Gus' crate, waiting\nfor the signal, half fearful of what would happen when it came.\n\nGlancing to left and right, he could see the other ships of Sector\nTwenty-three, slowly circling too, red identification lights strung\nalong their hulls.\n\nTen miles away a gigantic glowing ball danced in the middle of the\nspace-field, bobbing around like a jigging lantern. And beyond it were\nthe circling blue lights of the Thirty-seven team. And beyond them the\nglowing green space-buoys that marked the Thirty-seven goal line.\n\nMeek bent an attentive ear to the ticking of the motor, listening\nintently for the alien click he had detected a moment before. Gus'\nship, to tell the truth, was none too good. It might have been a good\nship once, but now it was worn out. It was sluggish and slow to respond\nto the controls, it had a dozen little tricks that kept one on the\njump. It had followed space trails too long, had plumped down to too\nmany bumpy landings in the maelstrom of the Belt.\n\nMeek sighed gustily. It would have been different if they had let him\ntake his own ship, but it was only on the condition that he use Gus'\nship that Thirty-seven had agreed to let him play at all. They had\nraised a fuss about it, but Twenty-three had the law squarely on its\nside.\n\nHe stole a glance toward the sidelines and saw hundreds of slowly\ncruising ships. Ships crammed with spectators out to watch the game.\nRadio ships that would beam a play by play description to be channeled\nto every radio station throughout the Solar system. Newsreel ships that\nwould film the clash of opposing craft. Ships filled with newsmen who\nwould transmit reams of copy back to Earth and Mars.\n\nLooking at them, Meek shuddered.\n\nHow in the world had he ever let himself get into a thing like this? He\nwas out to see the solar system, not to play a polo game ... especially\na polo game he didn't want to play.\n\nIt had been the bugs, of course. If it hadn't been for the bugs, Gus\nnever would have had the chance to talk him into that coaching business.\n\nHe should have spoken out, of course. Told them, flat out, that he\ndidn't know a thing about polo. Made them understand he wasn't going to\nhave a thing to do with this silly scheme. But they had shouted at him\nand laughed at him and bullied him. Been nice to him, too. That was the\nbiggest trouble. He was a sucker, he knew, for anyone who was nice to\nhim. Not many people had been.\n\nMaybe he should have gone to Miss Henrietta Perkins and explained. She\nmight have listened and understood. Although he wasn't any too sure\nabout that. She probably had plenty to do with starting the publicity\nrolling. After all, it was her job to make a showing on the jobs she\ndid.\n\nIf it hadn't been for Gus dusting off the place on the mantelpiece. If\nit hadn't been for the Titan City Junior Chamber of Commerce. If it\nhadn't been for all the ballyhoo about the mystery coach.\n\nBut more especially, if he'd kept his fool mouth shut and not made that\nbet with Craney.\n\n\n\nMeek groaned and tried to remember the few things he did know about\npolo. And he couldn't think of a single thing, not even some of the\nthings he had made up and told the boys.\n\nSuddenly a rocket flared from the referee's ship and with a jerk Meek\nhauled back the throttle. The ship gurgled and stuttered and for a\nmoment, heart in his throat, Meek thought it was going to blow up right\nthen and there.\n\nBut it didn't. It gathered itself together and leaped, forcing Meek\nhard against the chair, snapping back his head. Dazed, he reached out\nfor the repulsor trigger.\n\nAhead the glowing ball bounced and quivered, jumped this way and that\nas the ships spun in a mad melee with repulsor beams whipping out like\nstabbing knives.\n\nTwo of the ships crashed and fell apart like matchboxes. A third,\ntrying a sharp turn above the field of play, came unstuck and strewed\nitself across fifty miles of space.\n\nSubstitute ships dashed in from the sidelines, signalled by the\nreferee's blinking light. Rescue ships streaked out to pick up the\nplayers, salvage ships to clear away the pieces.\n\nFor a fleeting moment, Meek got the bobbing sphere in the cross-hairs\nand squeezed the trigger. The ball jumped as if someone had smacked it\nwith his fist, sailed across the field.\n\nFighting to bring the ship around, Meek yelled in fury at its\nslowness. Desperately pouring on the juice, he watched with agony as a\nblue-lighted ship streamed down across the void, heading for the ball.\n\nThe ship groaned in every joint, protesting and twisting as if in\nagony, as Meek forced it around. Suddenly there was a snap and the\nsudden swoosh of escaping air. Startled, Meek looked up. Bare ribs\nstood out against star-spangled space. A plate had been ripped off!\n\nFace strained behind the visor of his spacesuit, hunched over the\ncontrols, he waited for the rest of the plates to go. By some miracle\nthey hung on. One worked loose and flapped weirdly as the ship shivered\nin the turn.\n\nBut the turn had taken too long and Meek was too late. The blue-lamped\nship already had the ball, was streaking for the goal line. Jensen\nsomehow had had sense enough to refuse to be sucked out of goalie\nposition, and now he charged in to intercept.\n\nBut he muffed his chance. He dived in too fast and missed with his\nrepulsor beam by a mile at least. The ball sailed over the lighted\nbuoys and the first chukker was over with Thirty-seven leading by one\nscore.\n\nThe ships lined up again.\n\nThe rocket flared from the starter's ship and the ships plunged out.\nOne of Thirty-seven's ships began to lose things. Plates broke loose\nand fell away, a rocket snapped its moorings and sailed off at a\ntangent, spouting gouts of flame, the structural ribs came off and\nstrewed themselves along like spilling toothpicks.\n\nBattered by repulsor beams, the ball suddenly bounced upward and Meek,\ntrailing the field, waiting for just such a chance, played a savage\ntune on the tube controls.\n\nThe ship responded with a snap, executing a half roll and a hairpin\nturn that shook the breath from Meek. Two more plates tore off in the\nturn, but the ship plowed on. Now the ball was dead ahead and Meek gave\nit the works. The beam hit squarely and Meek followed through. The\nsecond chukker was over and the score was tied.\n\nNot until he was curving back above the Thirty-seven goal line, did\nMeek have time to wonder what had happened to the ship. It was sluggish\nno longer. It was full of zip. Almost like driving his own sleek craft.\nAlmost as if, the ship knew where he wanted it to go and went there.\n\nA hint of motion on the instrument panel caught his eye and he bent\nclose to see what it was. He stiffened. The panel seemed to be alive.\nSeemed to be crawling.\n\nHe bent closer and froze. It was crawling. There was no doubt of that.\nCrawling with rock-bugs.\n\n\n\nBreath whistling between his teeth, Meek ducked his head under the\npanel. Every wire, every control was oozing bugs!\n\nFor a moment he sat paralyzed by the thoughts that flickered through\nhis brain.\n\nGus, he knew, would have his scalp for this. Because he was the one\nthat had brought the bugs over to the rock where Gus lived and kept the\nship. They thought, of course, they had caught all of them that were\non his suit, but now it was clear they hadn't. Some of them must have\ngotten away and found the ship. They would have made straight for it,\nof course, because of the alloys that were in it. Why bother with a\nspacesuit or anything else when there was a ship around.\n\nOnly there were too many of them. There were thousands in the\ninstrument panel and other thousands in the controls and he couldn't\nhave brought back that many. Not if he'd hauled them back in pails.\n\nWhat was it Gus had said about them burrowing into metal just like\nchiggers burrow into human flesh?\n\nChiggers attacked humans to lay their eggs. Maybe ... maybe....\n\nA battalion of the bugs trooped across the face of an indicator and\nMeek saw they were smaller than the ones he had seen back on Gus' rock.\n\nThere was no doubt about it. They were young bugs. Bugs that has just\nhatched out. Thousands of them ... millions of them, maybe! And they\nwouldn't be in the instruments and controls alone, but all through the\nship. They'd be in the motors and the firing mechanisms ... all the\nplaces where the best alloys were used.\n\nMeek wrung his hands, watching them play tag across the panel. If\nthey'd had to hatch, why couldn't they have waited. Just until the game\nwas over, anyhow. That would have been all he'd asked. But they hadn't\nand here he was, with a couple of million bugs or so right smack in his\nlap.\n\nThe rocket flared again and the ships shot out.\n\nBitterness chewing at him, Meek flung the ship out savagely. What\ndid it matter what happened now. Gus would take the hide off him,\nrheumatism or no rheumatism, as soon as he found out about the bugs.\n\nFor a wild moment, he hoped he would crack up. Maybe the ship would\nfall apart like some of the others had. Like the old one hoss shay the\npoet had written about centuries ago. The ship had lost so many plates\nthat even now it was like flying a space-going box-kite.\n\nSuddenly a ship loomed directly ahead, diving from the zenith. Meek,\nforgetting his half-formed hope of a crackup a second before, froze\nin terror, but his fingers acted by pure instinct, stabbing at keys.\nAlthough in the petrified second that seemed half an eternity, Meek\nknew the ships would crash before he even touched the keys. And even as\nhe thought it, the ship ducked in a nerve-rending jerk and they were\nskinning past, hulls almost touching. Another jerk and more plates gone\nand there was the ball, directly ahead, with the repulsor beam already\nlicking out.\n\nMeek's jaw fell and a chill ran through his body and he couldn't move\na muscle. For he hadn't even touched the trigger and yet the repulsor\nbeam was flaring out, driving the ball ahead of it while the ship\ntwisted and squirmed its way through a mass of fighting craft.\n\nHands dangling limply at his side, Meek gaped in terror and disbelief.\nHe wasn't touching the controls, and yet the ship was like a thing\nbewitched. A split second later the ball was over the goal and the ship\nwas curving back, repulsor beam snapped off.\n\n\"It's the bugs!\" Meek whispered to himself, lips scarcely moving. \"The\nbugs have taken over!\"\n\nThe craft he was riding, he knew, was no longer just a ship, but\na collection of rock-bugs. Bugs that could work out mathematical\nequations. And now were playing polo!\n\nFor what was polo, anyhow, except a mathematical equation, a problem of\nusing certain points of force at certain points in space to arrive at\na predetermined end? Back on Gus' rock the bugs had worked as a unit\nto solve equations ... and the new hatch in the ship was working as a\nunit, too, to solve another kind of problem ... the problem of taking\na certain ball to a certain point despite certain variable and random\nfactors in the form of opposing spaceships.\n\nTentatively, half fearfully, Meek stabbed cautiously at a key which\nshould have turned the ship. The ship didn't turn. Meek snatched his\nhand away as if the key had burned his finger.\n\n\n\nBack on the line the ship wheeled into position of its own accord and a\nmoment later was off again. Meek clung to his chair with shaking hands.\nThere was, he knew, no use of even pretending he was trying to operate\nthe ship. There was just one thing that he was glad of. No one could\nsee him sitting there, doing nothing.\n\nBut the time would come ... and soon ... when he would have to do\nsomething. For he couldn't let the ship return to the Ring. To do\nthat would be to infest the other ships parked there, spread the bugs\nthroughout the solar system. And those bugs definitely were something\nthe solar system could get along without.\n\nThe ship shuddered and twisted, weaving its way through the pack of\nplayers. More plates ripped loose. Glancing up, Meek could see the\nglory of Saturn through the gleaming ribs.\n\nThen the ball was over the line and Meek's team mates were shrieking\nat him over the radio in his spacesuit ... happy, glee-filled yells\nof triumph. He didn't answer. He was too busy ripping out the control\nwires. But it didn't help. Even while he was doing it the ship went on\nunhampered and piled up another score.\n\nApparently the bugs didn't need the controls to make the ship do what\nthey wanted. More than likely they were in control of the firing\nmechanism at its very source. Maybe, and the thought curled the hair on\nMeek's neck, they were the firing mechanism. Maybe they had integrated\nthemselves with the very structure of the entire mechanism of the ship.\nThat would make the ship alive. A living chunk of machinery that paid\nno attention to the man who sat at the controls.\n\nMeanwhile, the ship made another goal....\n\nThere was a way to stop the bugs ... only one way ... but it was\ndangerous.\n\nBut probably not half as dangerous, Meek told himself, as Gus or the\nJunior Chamber or the Thirty-seven team ... especially the Thirty-seven\nteam ... if any of them found out what was going on.\n\nHe found a wrench and crawled back along the shivering ship.\n\nWorking in a frenzy of fear and need for haste, Meek took off the plate\nthat sealed the housing of the rear rocket assembly. Breath hissing in\nhis throat, he fought the burrs that anchored the tubes. There were a\nlot of them and they didn't come off easily. Rockets had to be anchored\nsecurely ... securely enough so the blast of atomic fire within their\nchambers wouldn't rip them free.\n\nMeanwhile, the ship piled up the score.\n\nLoose burrs rolled and danced along the floor and Meek knew the ship\nwas in the thick of play again. Then they were curving back. Another\ngoal!\n\nSuddenly the rocket assembly shook a little, began to vibrate. Wielding\nthe wrench like a madman, knowing he had seconds at the most, Meek spun\ntwo or three more bolts, then dropped the wrench and ran. Leaping for\na hole from which a plate had been torn, he caught a rib, swung with\nevery ounce of power he had, launching himself into space.\n\nHis right hand fumbled for the switch of the suit's rocket motor, found\nit, snapped it on to full acceleration. Something seemed to hit him on\nthe head and he sailed into the depths of blackness.\n\n\n                                  VI\n\nBilly Jones sat in the office of the repair shop, cigarette dangling\nfrom his lip, pouring smoke into his watery eye.\n\n\"Never saw anything like it in my life,\" he declared. \"How he made that\nship go at all with half the plates ripped off is way beyond me.\"\n\nThe dungareed mechanic sighted along the toes of his shoes, planted\ncomfortably on the desk.\n\n\"Let me tell you, mister,\" he declared, \"the solar system never has\nknown a pilot like him ... never will again. He brought his ship down\nhere with the instruments knocked out. Dead reckoning.\"\n\n\"Wrote a great piece about him,\" Billy said. \"How he died in the best\ntradition of space. Stuff like that. The readers will eat it up. The\nway that ship let go he didn't have a chance. Seemed to go out of\ncontrol all at once and went weaving and bucking almost into Saturn.\nThen blooey ... that's the end of it. One big splash of flame.\"\n\nThe mechanic squinted carefully at his toes. \"They're still out there,\nmessing around,\" he said, \"But they'll never find him. When that ship\nblew up he was scattered halfway out to Pluto.\"\n\nThe inner lock swung open ponderously and a spacesuited figure stepped\nin.\n\nThey waited while he snapped back his helmet.\n\n\"Good evening, gentlemen,\" said Oliver Meek.\n\nThey stared, slack-jawed.\n\nJones was the first to recover. \"But it can't be you! Your ship ... it\nexploded!\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Meek. \"I got out just before it went. Turned on my suit\nrocket full blast. Knocked me out. By the time I come to I was halfway\nout to the second Ring. Took me awhile to get back.\"\n\nHe turned to the mechanic. \"Maybe you have a second hand suit you would\nsell me. I have to get rid of this one. Has some bugs in it.\"\n\n\"Bugs? Oh, yes, I see. You mean something's wrong with it.\"\n\n\"That's it,\" said Meek. \"Something's wrong with it.\"\n\n\"I got one I'll let you have, free for nothing,\" said the mechanic.\n\"Boy, that was a swell game you played!\"\n\n\"Could I have the suit now?\" asked Meek. \"I'm in a hurry to get away.\"\n\nJones bounced to his feet. \"But you can't leave. Why, they think you're\ndead. They're out looking for you. And you won the cup ... the cup as\nthe most valuable team member.\"\n\n\"I just can't stay,\" said Meek. He shuffled his feet uneasily. \"Got\nplaces to go. Things to see. Stayed too long already.\"\n\n\"But the cup....\"\n\n\"Tell Gus I won the cup for him. Tell him to put it on that\nmantelpiece. In the place he dusted off for it.\"\n\nMeek's blue eyes shone queerly behind his glasses. \"Tell him maybe\nhe'll think of me sometimes when he looks at it.\"\n\nThe mechanic brought the suit. Meek bundled it under his arm, started\nfor the lock.\n\nThen turned back.\n\n\"Maybe you gentlemen....\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jones.\n\n\"Maybe you can tell me how many goals I made. I lost count, you see.\"\n\n\"You made nine,\" said Jones.\n\nMeek shook his head. \"Must be getting old,\" he said. \"When I was a kid\nI was a _ten goal_ man.\"\n\nThen he was gone, the lock swinging shut behind him.",
