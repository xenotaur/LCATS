    "body": "My job, finished now, had been getting them to Disneyland. The problem\nwas bringing one in particular--one I had to find. The timing was\nuncomfortably close.\n\nI'd taken the last of the yellow pills yesterday, tossing the bottle\naway with a sort of indifferent frustration. I won or lost on the\nvalidity of my logic--and whether I'd built a better mousetrap.\n\nThe pills had given me 24 hours before the fatal weakness took hold;\nnevertheless, I waited as long as I could. That left me less than an\nhour, now; strangely, as I walked in the eerie darkness of an early\nmorning, virtually deserted Disneyland, I felt calm. And yet, my life\ndepended on the one I sought being inside the Tour building.\n\nI was seeking a monster of terrible potential, yet so innocuous looking\nthat he'd not stand out. I couldn't produce him, couldn't say where in\nthe world he was. Nevertheless he was the basis, the motivation second\nonly to mine. I took the long, hard way--three years--making him come to\nme.\n\nTwo years were devoted to acclimatization, learning, and then swinging\nthis job: just to put the idea across.\n\nAssigned to Disneyland Public Relations in the offices at Burbank, I'd\nbegun with the usual low-pay, low-level jobs. I didn't, couldn't mind;\nat least I had a foot in the right door. Within six months, I reached a\npoint where I could present the idea.\n\nIt had enough merit. My boss--35 years' experience enabled him to\nrecognize a good idea--took it to his boss who took it to The Boss.\n\nTomorrowland is the orphan division of Disneyland, thrown in as sop to\nthose interested more in the future than the past. My idea was to sex up\nTomorrowland: Tour the Solar System.\n\nNot really, but we'd bill it that way. The Tour of the Solar System\nBuilding was to be large. Its rooms would reproduce environments of\nparts of the System, as best we knew them.\n\n\n\nI'll never forget the first planning session when we realists were\nunderdogs, yet swung the basic direction. By then, the Hollywood Mind\nhad appeared. The Hollywood Mind is definitely a real thing, a vicious\nthing, a blank thing, that paternalistically insists It knows what the\npublic wants.\n\nThere was general agreement on broad outlines. Trouble began over Venus.\n\n\"Of course,\" said one of the Minds, \"we'll easily create a swampy\nenvironment--\"\n\nI burst out with quiet desperation: \"May I comment?\"\n\nThe realists were churning. Right there, sides were being chosen. I let\nall know my side immediately.\n\n\"Venus is hot, but it's desert heat. Continuous dust storms with\nfantastic winds--\"\n\n\"People'd never go for that junk,\" interrupted the Mind. \"Everyone knows\nVenus is swampy.\"\n\n\"Everyone whose reading tastes matured no further than Edgar Rice\nBurroughs!\"\n\nThe Mind, with a if-you-know-so-much-why-aintcha-rich look, sneered,\n\"How come you know all about it?\"\n\nSpeechless, I spread my hands. This joker was leading with his chin,\nforcing the fight. I had to hit him again; if I lost, I lost good. \"A\nperson,\" I said slowly and rhythmically, \"with normal intelligence and a\nminute interest in the universe, will keep step with the major sciences,\nat least on an elementary level. I must stress the qualification of\nnormal intelligence.\"\n\nThe Mind, face contorted, was determined to get me. I was in a very\nvulnerable spot; more important, so was the idea.\n\nMind began an emotional tirade, and mentally I damned him. It couldn't\nhave mattered to him what environment we used, but he was politicking\nwhere he shouldn't.\n\nThere was silence when he stopped. This was the crux; The Boss would\ndecide. I held my breath.\n\nHe said, \"We'll make it hot and dusty.\" The realists had won; the rest\nclimbed on the bandwagon but quick; and the temple was cleansed.\n\nIt was natural--because at the moment I was fair-haired--for the project\nto become mine. God knows, I worked hard for it. I'd have to watch the\nMind, though; he would make things as difficult as possible.\n\nHowever, he'd proved he was the one person I wasn't seeking. One down\nand 2,499,999,999 to go.\n\nWithin a few days, a new opposition coalition formed, headed by the\nMind. Fortunately, they helped. I'd hesitated on one last point. Pushed.\nI gambled the momentum of the initial enthusiasm would carry it.\n\n\n\nOriginally the plan was a series of rooms, glassed off, that people\ncould stare into. There was something much better; engineering and I\nspent 36 hours straight, figuring costs, juggling space and equipment,\nuntil the modification didn't look too expensive--juggling is always\npossible in technical proposals. For the results, the cost was worth it.\nI hand-carried the proposal in.\n\nWhy not take people _through_ the rooms? We could even design a\nsimulated, usable spacesuit. There'd be airlock doors between the rooms\nfor effectiveness, insulation, economy. No children under ten allowed;\nno adults over 50. They'd go through in groups of 10 or 11.\n\nSure, I realized this was the most elaborate, most ambitious concession\never planned. The greatest ever attempted in its line, it would\ncost--both us and the public. But people will pay for value. They'd go\nfor a buck-and-a-half or even two; the lines of those filing past the\nwindows, at 50 cents a crack, would also bring in the dough.\n\nThey bought it. Not all--they nixed my idea of creating exact\nenvironmental conditions; and I didn't insist, luck and Hollywood being\nwhat they are.\n\nFrom the first, I established a special group to work on one problem.\nThey were dubbed the Gravity Gang, and immediately after, the GG. I\nhired them for the gravity of the situation, a standard gag that, once\nuttered, became as trite as the phrase. The Tour's realism would be\naffected by normal weight sensations.\n\nThe team consisted of a female set designer--who'd turn any male\nhead--from the Studio, a garage mechanic with 30 years' experience, an\nelectronics engineer, a science fiction writer, and the prettiest\ncompetent secretary available. I found Hazel, discovering with delight\nshe'd had three years of anthropology at UCLA.\n\nAs soon as they assembled, I explained their job: find a way to give the\nillusion of lessened gravity.\n\nWorking conditions would be the best possible--why I'd wanted the women\npretty--and their time was their own. I found the GG responded by\nworking 10 hours a day and thinking another 14. They were that sort.\n\nI couldn't know the GG was foredoomed to failure by its very collective\nnature; nor could I know, by its nature, the GG meant the difference\nbetween my success and failure.\n\nThe opposition put one over; we'd started referring to the job as Tour\nof the System Project. Next day, it was going the rounds as TS project.\nWords, words, and men will always fight with words.\n\nActually, the initials were worthy of the name. The engineering problems\nmounted like crazy. Words, words, and one of them got to the outside\nworld. Or maybe it was the additional construction crew we hired.\n\nOne logical spot for the building was next to the moon flight. The Tour\nbuilding now would be bigger than first planned, so we extended it\nsoutheasterly. This meant changing the roadbed of the Santa Fe &\nDisneyland R.R. It put me up to my ears in plane surveying--and gave me\na nasty shock.\n\nI looked up at someone's shout, in time to see a ton of cat rolling down\nthe embankment at me.\n\n\n\nWhat we were doing was easy. Using a spiral to transition gradually from\ntangent to circular curve and from circular curve to tangent. Easy?\nYeah. Sure.\n\nIf this was my baby, I'd damned well better know its personality traits.\nI was out with the surveyors, I was out with the construction gang, I\nwas out at the wrong time.\n\nAs the yellow beast, mindless servant of man, thundered down, I dove for\nthe rocks. Thank God for the rocks--we'd had to import them: the soil in\nOrange County is fine for oranges, but too soft for train roadbeds.\n\nChoking on the dust, I rolled over. The cat perched, grinning drunkenly,\non the rocks. The opposition or an accident? Surely the Mind wasn't\n_that_ desperate. But I was; I had to keep the idea alive, for myself as\nwell as completion of the original mission.\n\nSeveral million hands pulled me out; several million more patted away\nthe dust. Motionless, I'd just seen the driver of the cat. Seen him--and\nwas sorry.\n\nHe stood tall but hunched over; gaunt, with pasty skin, vapid eyes, and\na kind of yellow-nondescript hair.\n\nIt wasn't the physical characteristics, very similar to mine, that\nbothered me--once after an incomplete pass, I'd been told by a young\nlady that I was a \"thin, sallow lecher.\" I was swept by waves of\nimpending trouble, more frightened of him than of the opposition in\ntoto. Then, relieved, I realized the man wasn't the one I was expecting.\n\nBack in my office, I wasn't allowed the luxury of nervous reaction. Our\nspacesuit man wanted an Ok on design changes. Changes? What changes?...\nOh, yes, go ahead.\n\nA materials man wanted to know about weight. I told him where to go--for\nthe information.\n\nA written progress report from the GG briefly, sardonically, said: \"All\nthe talk about increased costs and lowered budget has decided us to ask\nif any aircraft, missile, or AEC groups have come up with anti-gravity.\nIt'd be a lot simpler that way. Love and kisses.\"\n\nI shrugged, wrote them a memo to take a week off for fishing, wenching,\nor reading Van Es on the Pleistocene stratigraphy of Java. I didn't\ncare, as long as they returned with a fresh point of view.\n\nThings were hectic already, less than four months after we'd started.\nAnd we hadn't much to show, except a shift in the roadbed of the SF & D\nRR. The opposition, growing stronger each day, could sit back and rest\nthe case, with nothing more than a smug, needling, I-told-you-so look.\n\nThe day finally came when we broke ground for the building. It was quite\nan achievement, and I invited the GG to dinner. I'd been drawn to the\nbunch of screwballs--the only name possible--more and more. Maybe\nbecause they were my brain-child, or maybe because lately they were the\nonly human company in which I could relax.\n\nThe Hotel is about a half-mile south of Disneyland. I arrived early,\nhoping to grab a ginger ale. Our set designer, Frank--christened\nFrancis--caught me at the door.\n\n\"Wanted to buy you a drink. This is the first time we've met socially.\"\n\nThat was true; it was equally true something bothered her. Damn it!\nTrapped, I'd have to drink. We ordered, and I mulled it over. Waited,\nbut she said nothing.\n\n\n\nThe drinks came. I shook several little, bright-yellow pills from the\nbottle, swallowed them, then drank. Frank cocked her head inquisitively.\n\n\"If you must know, they're for my ulcer.\"\n\n\"Didn't know you had one.\"\n\n\"Don't, but I'll probably get one, any day.\"\n\nShe laughed, and I drank again. I should do my drinking alone because I\nget boiled incredibly fast. It happened now. One second I was sober; the\nnext, drunk.\n\nResting a cheek on a wobbly palm-and-elbow, I said, \"Has everyone ever\nsaid you are the most beautiful--\"\n\n\"Yes, but in your present state, it isn't a good idea for you to add to\nthat number.\"\n\nI shifted to the other forearm. \"Frank, things might be different if I\nweren't a thin, sallow lecher.\"\n\n\"What a nice compliment--\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\n\"Especially since I work for you, nominally anyway--\"\n\n\"Uh huh, nominally.\"\n\n  \"Bosses should not make passes\n  At gals who work as lower classes.\"\n\n\"Uh, huh, familiar.\"\n\n\"But you are, and getting more so daily--\"\n\n\"Uh hu--are what?\" I asked in surprise.\n\n\"Thin, tired: the GG has decided you're working too hard.\"\n\n\"Because I don't use Vano.\" I grinned, having waited long to put that\none across.\n\n\"Be serious and listen--\"\n\n\"_You_ listen: if I'm working too hard, it's to finish. I _must_, and\nsoon.\"\n\n\"This compulsion,\" she paced her words, \"will kill you if you let it.\"\n\n\"It'll kill me if I don't let it--\"\n\n\"Here comes Harry.\"\n\nIt was time. Blearily, I fumbled with the pills, spilled the bottle.\nFrank helped me gather them up, as Harry arrived.\n\nHe said, a look of worry on his gaunt, gray features, \"The rest of us\nare waiting.\"\n\nConcerned, Frank asked, \"Think you're able?\"\n\n\"Anytime you say,\" I answered, in a cold-sober monotone.\n\nShe flushed, knowing I was sober, not knowing certainly if I were\nserious.\n\n\n\nWhen we were seated, I said enthusiastically, \"Chateaubriand tonight,\ngangsters.\"\n\nThe GG did not react as expected.\n\nDex, the electronics engineer, said quietly, \"If it's steak when the\nground is broken, what'll it be when the thing is finished?\"\n\n\"A feast, for all the animals in the world--just like\nSuleiman-bin-Daoud.\" This, from the GG writer, Mel.\n\nTheir faces showed the same thing that bothered Frank.\n\nHarry said, \"We have something to do.\"\n\n\"Well, do it!\" I tried weak joviality: \"It can't be anything of\nearth-shaking gravity.\"\n\nHazel, long since accepted as a GG member, replied, \"It's just that\nwe're ... resigned.\"\n\n\"_What?_\"\n\n\"We've produced nothing in months of sustained effort. That's why we're\nresigning,\" Dex replied disgustedly.\n\nFrank touched my arm, said softly, \"We've examined every angle. With the\nmoney available, it's just impossible to give a sensation of changed\nweight. And we know they've been pressuring you about us being on the\npayroll.\"\n\n\"Wait\"--desperately--\"if you pull out, everything will go. The\nopposition needs only something like this. Besides, the GG is the one\nbit of insanity I can depend on in a practical world, the prop for my\njudgment--\"\n\nHarry: \"Clouded judgment.\"\n\nMel: \"Expensive prop.\"\n\nHaving grown used to their friendly insults, I sensed their resolution\nweakening, felt the pendulum swinging back.\n\nThe waitress interrupted with news of an urgent phone call. It was the\nworst possible time for me to leave. And the news I got threw me.\nFeeling the weight of the world, I returned.\n\n\"Can't be in two places at once,\" I said bitterly. \"Go ahead without me;\nI'm leaving.\"\n\n\"Wait a few minutes,\" Mel said, between bites of steak, \"we want to\nresign. Sit down.\"\n\n\"Damn it, I can't! I spoke to The Boss. I've pulled a boo-boo, but big.\"\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"Bonestell will do the backgrounds, but he has to know what rocks we're\nputting in the rooms. What rocks are we? Anybody have an idea what the\nsurface of Mars looks like? God, how could I have missed that?\"\n\n\"Sit down,\" Dex said casually, \"we want to resign.\"\n\nHazel added, \"You can have your rocks in 24 hours. We worked it out\nweeks ago. I _did_ read Van Es, and Harry has prospected, and Dex knows\nminerals, and Mel pushed his way through Tyrrell's 'Principles of\nPetrology'--\"\n\n\"The science of rocks,\" Mel interrupted, between bites of steak.\n\n\"We got interested one day.\" Frank's pretty, dark eyes danced.\n\n\"We want to resign,\" Dex repeated casually, \"so sit down.\"\n\nI sat.\n\nThey began throwing the ball faster than I could catch: \"No atmosphere\non Mercury, then no oxidation; I insist there'd be no straight\nmetals.... The asteroids? Ferromagnesian blocks of some kind--any\nbasalts around here?... For Venus, grab a truckload of granodiorite--the\nspotted stuff--from the Sierra-Nevadas and tint it pink.... Lateritic\nsoils for Mars? You crazy? Must have water and a subtropical\nclimate....\"\n\nIt hit me: a valid use for the GG, one that already saved money. Make\nthem a brain team, trouble-shooters, or problem-solvers on questions\nthat could not be solved.\n\nI said, \"Fine, go ahead. About your resignations--\"\n\nMel said something indistinguishable--I'd caught him _on_ a bite of\nsteak.\n\nHazel, belligerent, demanded: \"Are you asking _us_ to resign?\"\n\nApparently I wasn't. So they stuck, and another crisis was met.\nUnfortunately, by then, I'd forgotten the shock and warning I got from\nthe cat.\n\n\n\nThings moved swiftly, more easily. The GG took over, becoming, in\neffect, my staff. They'd become more: five different extensions of me,\neach capable of acting correctly. As a team, they meshed beautifully.\n\nToo beautifully, at one point. Dex and Hazel were seeing eye-to-eye,\neven in the dark, and I worried about the effect on the others. I might\nas well have worried about the effect of a light bulb on the sun. They\nmarried or some such, refused time off, and the GG functioned, if\nanything, better. It was almost indecent the way the five got along\ntogether.\n\nA new problem arose: temperature. We weren't reproducing actual\ntemperatures, but the rooms needed a marked change, for reality's sake.\nI'd insisted on that, and having won the point, was stuck with it. It\nwas after 2 A.M.; I was alone in the office.\n\nThe sound of the outer door closing startled me. Footsteps approached; I\nhurried to clean my desk, sweeping the bottle into the drawer.\n\n\"You're up too late. Go home.\" Frank had a nonarguable look in her eye.\n\"You're supposed to be getting sleep.\"\n\n\"I am, far more than before you guys began helping, but--\"\n\n\"But with all that extra sleep, you're looking worse.\"\n\n\"I don't _need_ any more sleep!\" I said angrily, then tried diversion,\n\"Been on a date?\"\n\n\"Yes, but I thought I'd better check on you.\" She moved close to the\ndesk, and I remembered the last time we'd been alone, in the bar. Now I\nwas glad I wasn't drunk.\n\n\"What the devil are you up to?\"\n\n\n\nShe pawed through the desk drawers. \"Finding what you tried to hide--\"\n\n\"Wait, Frank!\" I yelled, too late.\n\nShe looked at the bottle, then me, with a strange expression: a little\npity--not patronizing--but mostly feminine understanding. \"Soda pop? Of\ncourse. You don't like alcohol, do you?\"\n\n\"No.\" Gruffly.\n\nHer eyes blinked rapidly, as though holding back tears. \"I know what's\nthe matter with you; I _really_ know.\"\n\n\"There's nothing the matter with me that--\"\n\n\"That beating this mess won't solve.\" We hadn't heard Mel enter. He\nleaned casually against the door. \"Terrific idea for a story.\"\n\nI shrugged. \"Seems to be homecoming night.\"\n\n\"Not quite,\" he glanced at his watch, \"but wait another few minutes.\"\n\nHe was right: Harry, out of breath, was the last of the GG to arrive.\n\n\"Now what?\" I asked. \"Surely this meeting isn't an accident?\"\n\nDex said thoughtfully, \"No, not really, but it is in the sense you mean.\nWe didn't agree to appear tonight. Yet logically, it's time for the\ntemperature problem--well, I guess each of us came down to help.\"\n\nWhat could I do? That was the GG, characteristically, so we talked\ntemperatures.\n\n\"What I was thinking,\" Harry began slowly, \"was a sort of\nsuperthermostat.\" Harry, as usual, came to the right starting point.\n\nFrank smiled, \"That's right, especially considering layout. Venus and\nMercury are hot; the others, cold. What about a control console that'll\nlight when the rooms get outside normal temperature range? Then the\noperator--\"\n\n\"Hey! Why an operator?\" Mel questioned. \"We ought to make this\nautomatic.\" He grinned. \"Giant computer ... can see it now: the brain\ncomes alive, tries to destroy anyone turning it off--\"\n\nI asked: \"Have you been _reading_ the stuff you write?\" Funny enough for\n3 A.M.\n\nDex said calmly, \"We _can_ work this--in fact, we can tie it in pink\nribbons and forget it. An electronics outfit in Pasadena makes an\nautomatic scanning and logging system. Works off punched-paper tape.\nWe'll code the right poop, and the system will compare it with the\nactual raw data. Feedback will be to a master control servo that'll\nactivate the heater or cooler. Now, we need the right pickup--\"\n\nI snapped my fingers. \"Variable resistor bridge. Couple of resistors\nequal at the right temperature. There'll be a frequency change with\nchanging temperature--better than a thermocouple, I think.\"\n\nThey looked at me as though I were butting in.\n\n\"You've been reading, too,\" Dex accused. \"Ok, we'll use a temperature\nbulb. Trouble is, with this system, we'd better let it run continuously.\nThat'll drive costs up.\"\n\nHazel asked, \"Can't we use the heat, maybe to drive a compressor? The\nsudden expansion of air could cool the rest. Harry?\"\n\nHarry hadn't time to answer.\n\n\"What'll this cost?\" I snapped.\n\n\"Roughly, 15 to 18 thousand,\" Dex replied.\n\n\"_What?_\"\n\nWith fine impartiality, they ignored me completely. Harry continued, as\nthough without interruption, \"Ye-es, I guess a compressor-and-coolant\nsystem could be arranged ...\"\n\n\n\nWe broke up at 6 A.M. I took one of my pills, frowning at the bottle.\nSeemed to be emptying fast. Sleepily, I shook the thought off and faced\nthe new day--little knowing the opposition had managed to skizzle us\nagain.\n\nThe last displays were moons of Jupiter and Saturn; it was impossible to\nrecreate tortured conditions of the planets themselves. Saturn's closest\nmoon, Mimas, was picked.\n\nOur grand finale: landing on Mimas with Saturn rising spectacularly out\nof the east. Mimas is in the plane of the rings, so they couldn't be\nobvious. We'd show enough, however, to make it damned impressive, and\nexplain it by libration of the satellite.\n\nThe mechanics of realistically moving Saturn was rougher than a cob. And\nthat's where the opposition fixed us. They claimed there wasn't enough\ndrama in the tour. Let it end with a flash of light, a roar, and a\nmeteor striking nearby.\n\nThe roar came from us. Mimas had no atmosphere--how could the meteor\nsound off or burn up? We finally compromised, permitting the meteor to\nhit.\n\nWe'd decided early the customers couldn't walk through. Mel first,\nHarry, then Dex, together produced an electric-powered, open runabout.\nThe cart ran on treads in contact with skillfully hidden tracks, for the\ncurrent channel. A futuristic touch, that--we'd say the cart ran on\nbroadcast power.\n\nThe power source provided cart headlights, and made batteries\nunnecessary for the guide's walkie-talkie and the customers' helmet\nreceivers.\n\nMimas' last section of track was on a vibrating platform. The cart\ntripped a switch; when the meteor supposedly hit, the platform would\ndrop and rise three inches, fast, twisting while it did--\"enough,\" Mel\nsaid grimly, \"to shake the damned _kishkas_ out of 'em!\"\n\nWe cracked that one, just in time for another. It began with Venus, as\nmost of my problems had. We planned constant dust storms for Venus. Real\nquick, there'd be nothing left of the Bonestell's backgrounds but a\nblank wall, from mechanical erosion.\n\nAnd how did we intend--?\n\nGlass--\n\nToo easily scratched. Lord, another one: how will the half-a-buck\ncustomers be able to see inside?\n\nGlass and one of those silicon plastics?\n\nBetter, but--\n\nHarry beat it: glass, plastic, _and_ a boundary layer of cold air,\njetted down from the ceiling, in front of the background painting and\nback of the look-in window. I was glad, for lately, Harry had begun to\nage. Thin and gray, he showed the strain--as did all of us.\n\n\n\nWe were sitting in an administration office at the park. I now\nrecognized the symptoms; when the GG had no real problems, its\ncollective mind usually turned to my health. I wouldn't admit it, but I\nfelt a little peaked. Little? Hell, bone-tired, dog-weary pooped. Seemed\nevery motion was effort, but soon it would end.\n\nThe phone rang. With the message, it _was_ ended.\n\n\"Let's go, grouseketeers.\"\n\nThere was almost a pregnant pause. Six months: conception of the idea to\ndelivery of finished product; six months, working together, fighting\nmen, nature, and the perversity of inanimate objects--all of this now\nwas done.\n\nNo one moved; Frank verbalized it: \"I'm scared.\" She sounded scared.\n\n\"Better than being petrified, which I am,\" I answered. \"But we might as\nwell face it.\"\n\nWe dragged over to the TS building, an impressive structure.\n\nThe guide played it straight, told us exactly how to suit up. Then, in\nthe cart, we edged into the tunnel that was the first lock, and--warned\nto set our filters--emerged onto the blinding surface of Mercury.\n\nWe felt the heat momentarily--Mercury and Venus were kept at a constant\n140 F, the others at 0 F--but it was a deliberate thrill. Then cool air\nfrom the cart suit-connections began circulating.\n\nBonestell was magnificent, as always. Yellow landscape, spatter cones,\nglittering streaks that might be metal in the volcanic ground--created\nby dusting ground mica on wet glue to catch the reflection of the sun.\nIt was a masterpiece.\n\nThe sun. Black sky holding a giant, blazing ball. Too damned yellow, but\nfiltered carbon arcs were the best we could do.\n\nDown, into the tunnel that was lock two. This next one ... Venus,\nobvious opposition point of attack, where we'd had the most trouble:\nVenus _had_ to be right.\n\nIt was! A blast of wind struck us, and dust, swirling everywhere. We'd\ndiscovered there's no such thing as a sand storm--it's really dust--so\nwe'd taken pains making things look right. Sand dunes were carefully\ncemented in place; dust rippling over gave the proper illusion.\n\nOddly shaped rocks, dimly seen, strengthened the impression of\nwind-abraded topography. Rocks were reddish, overlain by smears of\nbright yellow. Lot of trouble placing all that flowers of sulfur, but we\npostulated a liquid sulfur-sulfur dioxide-carbon dioxide cycle.\n\nOverhead, a diffused, intense yellow light. The sun--we were on the\ndaylight side.\n\nI sighed, relaxed, knowing this one had worked out.\n\nWe gave the moon little time. For those who had become homesick, Earth\nwas hanging magnificently in the sky. At a crater wall, we stopped,\nostensibly to let souvenir hunters pick at small pieces of lunar rock\nwithout leaving the cart.\n\nWe'd argued hours on what type to use, till Mel dragged out his rock\nbook. Most, automatically, had wanted basalt. However, the moon's\ndensity being low, heavier rocks are probably scarce--one good reason\nnot to expect radioactive ores there. We finally settled for rhyolite\nand obsidian.\n\nStopping on the moon had another purpose. We kept the room temperature\nat 70 F, for heating and cooling economy; the transition from Venus to\nMars was much simpler if ambient temperature dropped from 140 to 70 and\nfrom 70 to 0, rather than straight through the range.\n\n\n\nNext, a Martian polar cap, and we looked down a long canal that\ndisappeared on the horizon. Water appeared to run uphill for that\neffect. The whole scene looked like an Arizona highway at dusk--what it\nshould have. To our right, a suggestion of--damn the opposition's\neyes--culture: a large stone whatzit. It was a jarring note.\n\nWe selected one of those nondescript asteroids with just enough diameter\nto show extreme curvature. Frank had done magnificently. I found myself\nhanging onto the cart. Headlights deliberately dimmed, on the rocky\nsurface, the cart bumped wildly. The sky was black, broken only by\nlittle, hard chunks of light. No horizon. The feeling of being ready to\ndrop was intense, possibly too much so.\n\nEuropa, then, in a valley of ice. We'd picked Jupiter's third moon\nbecause its frozen atmosphere permitted some eerie pseudo-ice\nsculpturing. As we moved, Jupiter appeared between breaks and peaks in\nthe sheer wall. Worked nicely, seeing the monstrous planet distended\noverhead, like a gaily colored beach ball moving with us, as the moon\nfrom a train window. Unfortunately, the ice forms detracted somewhat.\n\nMimas, pitch black, then a glow. Stark landscape quickly becoming\nvisible. Steep cliffs, rocky plain. Saturn rising. The rings, their\nshadow on the globe, the beauty of it, made me sit stunned, though I\nknew what to expect.\n\nThe guide warned us radar spotted an approaching object, probably a\nmeteor. We ran, the cart at maximum speed--not much, really. It tore at\nyou, wanting to stare at Saturn, wanting to duck.\n\nHit the special section, dropped and rose our three inches--one hell of\na distance--and the tour was over. I kept thinking, insanely, that the\nmeteor _was_ a perfect conflict touch.\n\nWe unsuited silently. Finally, Hazel breathed, \"Hallelujah!\" It was\nsummation of success. There now remained but one thing: wait for the\nquarry to show.\n\nI estimated the necessary time at four days and nights after opening. It\nwas hard to wait, hard not to fidget under the watchful--the only\nword--eyes of the GG. They were up to something, undoubtedly. But there\nwas something far more important: I'd narrowed the 2,499,999,999 down to\nfive.\n\nThe one I sought was a member of the GG.\n\n\n\nOpening night brought Harry and Frank to my office. They tried to be\ncasual, engaged me in desultory nothings. Frank looked reproachful--I\nwas there too late.\n\nThe following night, Mel ambled in at midnight. He grinned, discussed a\nplot, suggested we go out for a beer, changed his mind, left.\n\nThe third night, I waited in the dark. Nor was I disappointed: Dex and\nHazel showed.\n\n\"What do you want? It's 2 A.M.!\"\n\nThere was a long regrouping pause; then Hazel said, \"Dex has a fine\nidea.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I've been thinking about gravity--\"\n\n\"About time,\" I said sarcastically, disliking myself but hoping it would\nget rid of them, \"we opened three days ago.\"\n\nHe ignored my petulance and grinned. \"No, I meant anti-gravity. I think\nit's possible. If you had a superconductor in an inductance field--\"\n\n\"Why tell me?\"\n\n\"Thought you'd have some ideas.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"That's what I hired _you_ for. My only idea right now\nis going to sleep.\"\n\nBewildered, they left.\n\nAnd on the fourth night, no one came. So I headed for the Tour. Now,\nhaving risked everything on my logic, I was a dead pigeon if wrong.\nThere were only minutes left.\n\nI eased through the back door, heard our automation equipment humming.\nDespite darkness, I shortcutted, nearly reaching the door to the service\nhallway in back of the planetary rooms. There was a distinct click, and\na flashlight blinded me. I waited, stifling a cry, knowing if it were\nhe, death was next.\n\nDeath never spoke in such quiet, sweet tones. Frank asked, \"What are you\ndoing here?\"\n\n_Frank, Frank, not you!_\n\nSurprise shocked me: the light, her voice, the sudden suspicion. Still,\ndiversion and counterattack ... \"Perhaps you've the explaining to do,\" I\nsaid nastily. \"Why are you here?\"\n\nHer wide-eyed ingenuousness making me more suspicious, she answered,\n\"Waiting to see if you'd appear.\" Then she stopped being truthful: \"You\nforget we had a date--\"\n\n\"We didn't have any damned date,\" I said flatly, hurting deep within.\n\n\"All right, I want to know why you're still driving yourself. It isn't\nwork; that's finished.\"\n\nThe way she talked made me hopeful. Maybe she wasn't the one ... and\nthen came fear. Frank, if he's here, you're in danger. The monster\nrespects nothing we hold dear--law, property, dignity, life.\n\nThere was one way to find out: make her leave. I wrenched the flashlight\nfrom her, smashed it on the concrete floor. \"I mean this: get the hell\nout of here, and stay out!\"\n\nShe said, distastefully, \"I've seen it happen, but never this fast.\nYou've gone Hollywood, you're a genius, you're tremendous--forgetting\nother people who helped. Go ahead with your mysterious deal--and I hope\nwe never meet again.\"\n\nI struggled with ambivalence. This might be a trick; if not, Frank now\nhated me irreparably.\n\n\n\nNo time to worry about human emotions, not any more. Nausea reminded me\nof the primary purpose. I continued down the dark hallway, listening for\nFrank's return, hoping she needn't die.\n\nLight was unnecessary: I knew the right door. Because it started here,\nit would end here. Quickly, silently, I slipped inside the Venus room.\nWith peculiar relief, I realized Frank wasn't it: my nose led me right\nto the monster.\n\nIn an ecstatic, semistuporous state, smelling strongly of sulfur\ndioxide, he couldn't have been aware of me. Couldn't?\n\n\"It took you long enough.\" He didn't bother to turn from the rock he was\nhuddled against.\n\n\"I had to be sure.\" I felt anything but the calm carried in my voice.\n\"No wonder the GG got the right answers, with you making initial starts.\nSay, were you responsible for the cat that rolled at me?\"\n\n\"An accident. Obviously, I wanted this room built as much as you.\"\nHarry, now undisguised, languorously turned. \"Your little trap didn't\nquite come off--a danger in fighting a superior intellect.\"\n\n\"No trap. I had a job to do; it's done.\"\n\n\"Job? Job?\" Infuriated, leaping to his feet, he shouted, \"Speak the\nnative tongue, filth!\"\n\n\"What's the use? Because of you, I'll never again have the chance. And\nyou no longer have a native tongue.\"\n\n\"Who were those judges,\" he asked bitterly, \"to declare _me_ an\noutcast?\"\n\n\"Representatives of an outraged society.\" I almost lost my temper,\nthinking of this deviant's crimes. \"You were lucky to get banishment\ninstead of death.\"\n\nHe grinned. \"So were you.\"\n\n\"True. I tried to find the proper place, where you'd have some chance.\"\n\nHe laughed openly. \"I fixed the ship nicely.\"\n\n\"You don't understand at all--\"\n\n\"I counted on your being a hero, trying to save us. So, I escaped.\"\n\n\"For three years only.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"One of us won't leave here.\"\n\nHarry frowned, then tried cunning. \"Aren't you being silly? We are\nhopelessly marooned. Surely there are overriding considerations to your\nchildish devotion to duty.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"This is too small a room for us. Even if I trusted\nyou, I couldn't allow you at this naive young world.\"\n\nVoices suddenly approached. \"The GG?\" Harry questioned.\n\n\"Didn't know they were coming.\" Desperately, I looked about, found an\neroded mass. \"Hide there; I'll get rid of them.\"\n\n\"You'd better--we have business.\" Possibly it was the only time I've\nagreed with him. Mel and Dex came in. I called, \"Over here!\"\n\n\n\nDex snapped his fingers. \"_Knew_ it was Venus.\"\n\nMel wrinkled his nose. \"Sulfur dioxide, too, like we figured. Soda pop,\nwhen I broke into that tender scene between you and Frank--that gave you\nnecessary carbon dioxide, right, am I not?\"\n\n\"Yes ... Why don't you guys leave me alone?\" Beginning to falter in the\nheat, they dripped perspiration. \"You could die in this chilly\nclimate.\"\n\nDex said, \"Listen for a second. We don't have to break up. Let's form a\nservice organization, 'Problems, Inc.' or some equally stupid title.\nVery soon we could afford a private bedroom, like this, for you to stay\nin all the time--\"\n\n\"Need only two or three nights in ten.\" Harry was moving restlessly. He\nwouldn't wait much longer. \"Combination of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and\nsulfur under relatively high temperature is how I eat. Pills can\nsubstitute, but not for protracted periods. That's why I had to build\nthis room. Couple of weeks, and I'll be in the pink; as pink as you,\nanyway.\"\n\nAbruptly, I lay down, ignoring them. I had to make my friends go. Harry\ncould literally have shredded them. Footsteps: the door closed; relief\nand loneliness joined me, but only for a moment.\n\nHis voice sliced the darkness: \"I'm a man of honor, and must warn you.\nIf we fight, you'll lose. I escaped with far more pills than you; you're\nweaker.\"\n\nI said sardonically, \"With you stealing parts of my supply, that's\nprobably the only truthful thing you've said!\"\n\n\"I've been in here three nights, adjusting my metabolism ...\"\n\nHe came at me then, not breaking his flow of speech. At home, I'd have\nbeen surprised at the dishonor. Instead, I was expecting it. He ran into\nmy balled fist.\n\nIf we'd been home ... if, if, if, if, if. At full strength, I could have\nbroken his neck with the blow. Now, he simply rolled back and fell.\nLaughing, he attacked again. We were weak as babes, and fought like it.\nClumsily, slowly, we went through the motions.\n\nHe'd been right--he was a little stronger, and the relative difference\nbegan to tell. Soon I was falling from his blows.\n\nHands on my neck, he kneed me hard in the stomach. Violently ill, I felt\nthe sulfur dioxide rush from my lungs.\n\nI remembered one trick they'd taught at school, and I used it. Unable to\nbreak his hold, I managed to get my hands around his throat. We locked,\neach silent.\n\nSilent until I felt my last reserves going, until the crooning of the\nSong of Eternity began. This couldn't happen, not to this planet. With\nall my strength, I gave one last squeeze--but it failed. From somewhere,\nlight-years of light-years away, I heard Frank, realized I'd played the\nfool: she'd been working for the monster.\n\nA blinding flash inside my head--and the Last Darkness descended.\n\n\n\nThe light hadn't been inside my head: it flooded the room. Dimly, I was\naware of the injection, and immediately felt better. Harry was gone.\n\nThe GG, minus one, was gathered around. Mel said, \"It was a dilute\nsolution of cerium nitrate. We figured the percentage on the basis of\nthe pill Frank swiped. Hope you aren't poisoned.\"\n\n\"No.\" My voice was weak, \"Need it. Oxidizing agent for the sulfur.\"\n\n\"Harry's dead,\" Hazel frowned. \"When we came in, you'd broken his neck,\nwere crooning to yourself.\"\n\nSo _I_ had been crooning the Song of Eternity? \"I'm a\"--I felt silly--\"a\ncop on a mission. I waited until whichever of you it was settled down\nhere. That one had to be the criminal, to be done away with.\"\n\n\"Dex and I got rid of the body,\" Mel said. \"No need to worry unless ...\nunless you've read my stories. Perhaps _you_ are the criminal. I'll be\nwatching.\"\n\n\"No proof, of course ... Do _you_ believe I'm the criminal?\"\n\nMel smiled. \"No, but I'll watch anyway.\"\n\n\"More closely than tonight, I hope,\" Hazel said acidly. \"If it hadn't\nbeen for her....\"\n\n\n\nI saw Frank, and was ashamed of my suspicions. She was silent, looking\nconcerned. They all did, and I was warmed. Because, despite discomfort,\nthey worried about me, an alien, a stranger. \"Better leave. Heat's\ngetting you.\"\n\nDex asked, \"When are you going back?\"\n\nI shrugged. \"Never. The ship is in the Gulf of California ... Harry did\nthat.\"\n\n\"What about our company? We can research anti-gravity. You might reach\nhome yet.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"Said I was a policeman. I don't know very much--\"\n\n\"Perfectly normal!\" Mel said before Hazel shooshed him.\n\nDex was insistent: \"Any cop knows at least something about his\nmotorcycle. Was I right about the superconductor?\"\n\n\"Yes. Now, get out of here, idiots, before there's no one left to form\nthe company!\"\n\nHazel, perspiring freely, red hair shimmering, kissed me. \"We figured\nyou out real, real early. We aren't ever wrong, and I'm glad we stayed\nwith you, Mr. Venus.\" She laughed joyously, \"First time I've ever kissed\na Venusian!\"\n\nFrank, head close to mine, said softly, \"I'm terribly sorry I said those\nthings, but you had to believe I was angry, so I could call the\nothers--\"\n\n\"And I did everything possible to get you out....\"\n\nWe were silent; then I said what I'd been fighting not to, for so long.\n\"Frank ... Francis?\"\n\nShe understood, and stared horrified at me. I'd lost. Bowed my head,\nfeeling like the damned fool I was.\n\nShe looked around the room. \"It's so strange!\"\n\n\"And with ingrained racial conditioning, you couldn't respond to a\nthin, sallow alien.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said hesitantly.\n\n\"I do!\" Mel said. \"The oldest story in science fiction; it's true; I\ncan't write it.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"No editor in right or wrong mind would buy the beautiful Earth damsel,\nafter whom lusts the Monster from Venus--\"\n\nFrank snapped: \"He isn't a monster! And his manners are better than many\nwriters' I could name ...\"\n\nHer voice trailed off with awareness of Mel's tiny smile--a smile that\nwidened. He pulled her toward the door. \"What a story! We'll hold the\nwedding in a Turkish Bath.\"\n\nAlone, I sighed, comfortable again after three years. I was grateful to\nthe GG, and would do anything, within limits, for them. Yet, my newly\nadopted planet needed protection. Babes in the woods, they'd be torn to\npieces outside.\n\nFortunately, the GG didn't know my meaning of \"policeman\", my home's\nhighest order of intellect. I'd assure the group finally getting\nanti-gravity and use of planetary lines of force. But not the hyperspace\ndrive, not for a good long while.\n\nI certainly couldn't destroy the GG's confidence. I couldn't hurt them.\nThey were so sure about me--so sure they were never wrong. How could I\nexplain I'd been looking for a decent, habitable planet like Venus to\ndischarge my captive, that I was from another galaxy?\n\n\nTHE END\n\n",
