    "body": "by Mark Twain\n\n\n\n          The Pathfinder and The Deerslayer stand at the head of Cooper's\n          novels as artistic creations.  There are others of his works\n          which contain parts as perfect as are to be found in these, and\n          scenes even more thrilling.  Not one can be compared with\n          either of them as a finished whole.\n\n          The defects in both of these tales are comparatively slight.\n          They were pure works of art.--Prof. Lounsbury.\n\n\n          The five tales reveal an extraordinary fulness of invention.\n          ...  One of the very greatest characters in fiction, Natty\n          Bumppo....\n\n          The craft of the woodsman, the tricks of the trapper, all the\n          delicate art of the forest, were familiar to Cooper from his\n          youth up.--Prof. Brander Matthews.\n\n          Cooper is the greatest artist in the domain of romantic fiction\n          yet produced by America.--Wilkie Collins.\n\n\nIt seems to me that it was far from right for the Professor of English\nLiterature in Yale, the Professor of English Literature in Columbia, and\nWilkie Collins to deliver opinions on Cooper's literature without having\nread some of it. It would have been much more decorous to keep silent\nand let persons talk who have read Cooper.\n\nCooper's art has some defects. In one place in 'Deerslayer,' and in the\nrestricted space of two-thirds of a page, Cooper has scored 114 offences\nagainst literary art out of a possible 115. It breaks the record.\n\nThere are nineteen rules governing literary art in the domain of\nromantic fiction--some say twenty-two. In Deerslayer Cooper violated\neighteen of them. These eighteen require:\n\n1. That a tale shall accomplish something and arrive somewhere. But the\nDeerslayer tale accomplishes nothing and arrives in the air.\n\n2. They require that the episodes of a tale shall be necessary parts of\nthe tale, and shall help to develop it. But as the Deerslayer tale is\nnot a tale, and accomplishes nothing and arrives nowhere, the episodes\nhave no rightful place in the work, since there was nothing for them to\ndevelop.\n\n3. They require that the personages in a tale shall be alive, except in\nthe case of corpses, and that always the reader shall be able to tell\nthe corpses from the others. But this detail has often been overlooked\nin the Deerslayer tale.\n\n4. They require that the personages in a tale, both dead and alive,\nshall exhibit a sufficient excuse for being there. But this detail also\nhas been overlooked in the Deerslayer tale.\n\n5. They require that when the personages of a tale deal in conversation,\nthe talk shall sound like human talk, and be talk such as human\nbeings would be likely to talk in the given circumstances, and have\na discoverable meaning, also a discoverable purpose, and a show of\nrelevancy, and remain in the neighborhood of the subject in hand, and\nbe interesting to the reader, and help out the tale, and stop when the\npeople cannot think of anything more to say. But this requirement has\nbeen ignored from the beginning of the Deerslayer tale to the end of it.\n\n6. They require that when the author describes the character of a\npersonage in his tale, the conduct and conversation of that personage\nshall justify said description. But this law gets little or no attention\nin the Deerslayer tale, as Natty Bumppo's case will amply prove.\n\n7. They require that when a personage talks like an illustrated,\ngilt-edged, tree-calf, hand-tooled, seven-dollar Friendship's Offering\nin the beginning of a paragraph, he shall not talk like a negro minstrel\nin the end of it. But this rule is flung down and danced upon in the\nDeerslayer tale.\n\n8. They require that crass stupidities shall not be played upon the\nreader as \u201cthe craft of the woodsman, the delicate art of the forest,\u201d\n by either the author or the people in the tale. But this rule is\npersistently violated in the Deerslayer tale.\n\n9. They require that the personages of a tale shall confine themselves\nto possibilities and let miracles alone; or, if they venture a miracle,\nthe author must so plausibly set it forth as to make it look possible\nand reasonable. But these rules are not respected in the Deerslayer\ntale.\n\n10. They require that the author shall make the reader feel a deep\ninterest in the personages of his tale and in their fate; and that he\nshall make the reader love the good people in the tale and hate the bad\nones. But the reader of the Deerslayer tale dislikes the good people in\nit, is indifferent to the others, and wishes they would all get drowned\ntogether.\n\n11. They require that the characters in a tale shall be so clearly\ndefined that the reader can tell beforehand what each will do in a given\nemergency. But in the Deerslayer tale this rule is vacated.\n\nIn addition to these large rules there are some little ones. These\nrequire that the author shall:\n\n12. Say what he is proposing to say, not merely come near it.\n\n13. Use the right word, not its second cousin.\n\n14. Eschew surplusage.\n\n15. Not omit necessary details.\n\n16. Avoid slovenliness of form.\n\n17. Use good grammar.\n\n18. Employ a simple and straightforward style.\n\nEven these seven are coldly and persistently violated in the Deerslayer\ntale.\n\nCooper's gift in the way of invention was not a rich endowment; but\nsuch as it was he liked to work it, he was pleased with the effects,\nand indeed he did some quite sweet things with it. In his little box of\nstage properties he kept six or eight cunning devices, tricks, artifices\nfor his savages and woodsmen to deceive and circumvent each other with,\nand he was never so happy as when he was working these innocent things\nand seeing them go. A favorite one was to make a moccasined person tread\nin the tracks of the moccasined enemy, and thus hide his own trail.\nCooper wore out barrels and barrels of moccasins in working that trick.\nAnother stage-property that he pulled out of his box pretty frequently\nwas his broken twig. He prized his broken twig above all the rest of his\neffects, and worked it the hardest. It is a restful chapter in any book\nof his when somebody doesn't step on a dry twig and alarm all the reds\nand whites for two hundred yards around. Every time a Cooper person is\nin peril, and absolute silence is worth four dollars a minute, he is\nsure to step on a dry twig. There may be a hundred handier things to\nstep on, but that wouldn't satisfy Cooper. Cooper requires him to turn\nout and find a dry twig; and if he can't do it, go and borrow one. In\nfact, the Leather Stocking Series ought to have been called the Broken\nTwig Series.\n\nI am sorry there is not room to put in a few dozen instances of the\ndelicate art of the forest, as practised by Natty Bumppo and some of the\nother Cooperian experts. Perhaps we may venture two or three samples.\nCooper was a sailor--a naval officer; yet he gravely tells us how\na vessel, driving towards a lee shore in a gale, is steered for a\nparticular spot by her skipper because he knows of an undertow there\nwhich will hold her back against the gale and save her. For just pure\nwoodcraft, or sailorcraft, or whatever it is, isn't that neat? For\nseveral years Cooper was daily in the society of artillery, and he ought\nto have noticed that when a cannon-ball strikes the ground it either\nburies itself or skips a hundred feet or so; skips again a hundred feet\nor so--and so on, till finally it gets tired and rolls. Now in one place\nhe loses some \u201cfemales\u201d--as he always calls women--in the edge of a wood\nnear a plain at night in a fog, on purpose to give Bumppo a chance to\nshow off the delicate art of the forest before the reader. These\nmislaid people are hunting for a fort. They hear a cannonblast, and a\ncannon-ball presently comes rolling into the wood and stops at their\nfeet. To the females this suggests nothing. The case is very different\nwith the admirable Bumppo. I wish I may never know peace again if he\ndoesn't strike out promptly and follow the track of that cannon-ball\nacross the plain through the dense fog and find the fort. Isn't it\na daisy? If Cooper had any real knowledge of Nature's ways of doing\nthings, he had a most delicate art in concealing the fact. For instance:\none of his acute Indian experts, Chingachgook (pronounced Chicago,\nI think), has lost the trail of a person he is tracking through the\nforest. Apparently that trail is hopelessly lost. Neither you nor I\ncould ever have guessed out the way to find it. It was very different\nwith Chicago. Chicago was not stumped for long. He turned a running\nstream out of its course, and there, in the slush in its old bed, were\nthat person's moccasin-tracks. The current did not wash them away, as\nit would have done in all other like cases--no, even the eternal laws\nof Nature have to vacate when Cooper wants to put up a delicate job of\nwoodcraft on the reader.\n\nWe must be a little wary when Brander Matthews tells us that Cooper's\nbooks \u201creveal an extraordinary fulness of invention.\u201d As a rule, I\nam quite willing to accept Brander Matthews's literary judgments and\napplaud his lucid and graceful phrasing of them; but that particular\nstatement needs to be taken with a few tons of salt. Bless your heart,\nCooper hadn't any more invention than a horse; and I don't mean a\nhigh-class horse, either; I mean a clothes-horse. It would be very\ndifficult to find a really clever \u201csituation\u201d in Cooper's books, and\nstill more difficult to find one of any kind which he has failed to\nrender absurd by his handling of it. Look at the episodes of \u201cthe\ncaves\u201d; and at the celebrated scuffle between Maqua and those others\non the table-land a few days later; and at Hurry Harry's queer\nwater-transit from the castle to the ark; and at Deerslayer's half-hour\nwith his first corpse; and at the quarrel between Hurry Harry and\nDeerslayer later; and at--but choose for yourself; you can't go amiss.\n\nIf Cooper had been an observer his inventive faculty would have worked\nbetter; not more interestingly, but more rationally, more plausibly.\nCooper's proudest creations in the way of \u201csituations\u201d suffer noticeably\nfrom the absence of the observer's protecting gift. Cooper's eye was\nsplendidly inaccurate. Cooper seldom saw anything correctly. He saw\nnearly all things as through a glass eye, darkly. Of course a man who\ncannot see the commonest little every-day matters accurately is\nworking at a disadvantage when he is constructing a \u201csituation.\u201d In the\nDeerslayer tale Cooper has a stream which is fifty feet wide where it\nflows out of a lake; it presently narrows to twenty as it meanders along\nfor no given reason; and yet when a stream acts like that it ought to\nbe required to explain itself. Fourteen pages later the width of the\nbrook's outlet from the lake has suddenly shrunk thirty feet, and become\n\u201cthe narrowest part of the stream.\u201d This shrinkage is not accounted for.\nThe stream has bends in it, a sure indication that it has alluvial banks\nand cuts them; yet these bends are only thirty and fifty feet long. If\nCooper had been a nice and punctilious observer he would have noticed\nthat the bends were oftener nine hundred feet long than short of it.\n\nCooper made the exit of that stream fifty feet wide, in the first place,\nfor no particular reason; in the second place, he narrowed it to less\nthan twenty to accommodate some Indians. He bends a \u201csapling\u201d to the\nform of an arch over this narrow passage, and conceals six Indians in\nits foliage. They are \u201claying\u201d for a settler's scow or ark which is\ncoming up the stream on its way to the lake; it is being hauled against\nthe stiff current by a rope whose stationary end is anchored in the\nlake; its rate of progress cannot be more than a mile an hour. Cooper\ndescribes the ark, but pretty obscurely. In the matter of dimensions \u201cit\nwas little more than a modern canal-boat.\u201d Let us guess, then, that it\nwas about one hundred and forty feet long. It was of \u201cgreater breadth\nthan common.\u201d Let us guess, then, that it was about sixteen feet wide.\nThis leviathan had been prowling down bends which were but a third as\nlong as itself, and scraping between banks where it had only two feet of\nspace to spare on each side. We cannot too much admire this miracle.\nA low-roofed log dwelling occupies \u201ctwo-thirds of the ark's length\u201d--a\ndwelling ninety feet long and sixteen feet wide, let us say a kind of\nvestibule train. The dwelling has two rooms--each forty-five feet long\nand sixteen feet wide, let us guess. One of them is the bedroom of the\nHutter girls, Judith and Hetty; the other is the parlor in the daytime,\nat night it is papa's bedchamber. The ark is arriving at the stream's\nexit now, whose width has been reduced to less than twenty feet to\naccommodate the Indians--say to eighteen. There is a foot to spare on\neach side of the boat. Did the Indians notice that there was going to\nbe a tight squeeze there? Did they notice that they could make money by\nclimbing down out of that arched sapling and just stepping aboard when\nthe ark scraped by? No, other Indians would have noticed these things,\nbut Cooper's Indians never notice anything. Cooper thinks they are\nmarvelous creatures for noticing, but he was almost always in error\nabout his Indians. There was seldom a sane one among them.\n\nThe ark is one hundred and forty feet long; the dwelling is ninety feet\nlong. The idea of the Indians is to drop softly and secretly from the\narched sapling to the dwelling as the ark creeps along under it at the\nrate of a mile an hour, and butcher the family. It will take the ark a\nminute and a half to pass under. It will take the ninety foot dwelling\na minute to pass under. Now, then, what did the six Indians do? It would\ntake you thirty years to guess, and even then you would have to give it\nup, I believe. Therefore, I will tell you what the Indians did. Their\nchief, a person of quite extraordinary intellect for a Cooper Indian,\nwarily watched the canal-boat as it squeezed along under him, and when\nhe had got his calculations fined down to exactly the right shade, as\nhe judged, he let go and dropped. And missed the house! That is actually\nwhat he did. He missed the house, and landed in the stern of the scow.\nIt was not much of a fall, yet it knocked him silly. He lay there\nunconscious. If the house had been ninety-seven feet long he would have\nmade the trip. The fault was Cooper's, not his. The error lay in the\nconstruction of the house. Cooper was no architect.\n\nThere still remained in the roost five Indians.\n\nThe boat has passed under and is now out of their reach. Let me explain\nwhat the five did--you would not be able to reason it out for yourself.\nNo. 1 jumped for the boat, but fell in the water astern of it. Then No.\n2 jumped for the boat, but fell in the water still farther astern of it.\nThen No. 3 jumped for the boat, and fell a good way astern of it. Then\nNo. 4 jumped for the boat, and fell in the water away astern. Then\neven No. 5 made a jump for the boat--for he was a Cooper Indian. In\nthe matter of intellect, the difference between a Cooper Indian and the\nIndian that stands in front of the cigarshop is not spacious. The scow\nepisode is really a sublime burst of invention; but it does not\nthrill, because the inaccuracy of the details throws a sort of air of\nfictitiousness and general improbability over it. This comes of Cooper's\ninadequacy as an observer.\n\nThe reader will find some examples of Cooper's high talent for\ninaccurate observation in the account of the shooting-match in The\nPathfinder.\n\n          \u201cA common wrought nail was driven lightly into the target, its\n          head having been first touched with paint.\u201d\n\nThe color of the paint is not stated--an important omission, but Cooper\ndeals freely in important omissions. No, after all, it was not an\nimportant omission; for this nail-head is a hundred yards from the\nmarksmen, and could not be seen by them at that distance, no matter what\nits color might be.\n\nHow far can the best eyes see a common house-fly? A hundred yards? It is\nquite impossible. Very well; eyes that cannot see a house-fly that is a\nhundred yards away cannot see an ordinary nailhead at that distance, for\nthe size of the two objects is the same. It takes a keen eye to see a\nfly or a nailhead at fifty yards--one hundred and fifty feet. Can the\nreader do it?\n\nThe nail was lightly driven, its head painted, and game called. Then the\nCooper miracles began. The bullet of the first marksman chipped an edge\noff the nail-head; the next man's bullet drove the nail a little way\ninto the target--and removed all the paint. Haven't the miracles\ngone far enough now? Not to suit Cooper; for the purpose of\nthis whole scheme is to show off his prodigy, Deerslayer--\nHawkeye--Long-Rifle--Leather-Stocking--Pathfinder--Bumppo before\nthe ladies.\n\n          \u201c'Be all ready to clench it, boys!' cried out Pathfinder,\n          stepping into his friend's tracks the instant they were vacant.\n          'Never mind a new nail; I can see that, though the paint is\n          gone, and what I can see I can hit at a hundred yards, though\n          it were only a mosquito's eye.  Be ready to clench!'\n\n\u201cThe rifle cracked, the bullet sped its way, and the head of the nail\nwas buried in the wood, covered by the piece of flattened lead.\u201d\n\nThere, you see, is a man who could hunt flies with a rifle, and command\na ducal salary in a Wild West show to-day if we had him back with us.\n\nThe recorded feat is certainly surprising just as it stands; but it\nis not surprising enough for Cooper. Cooper adds a touch. He has made\nPathfinder do this miracle with another man's rifle; and not only that,\nbut Pathfinder did not have even the advantage of loading it himself.\nHe had everything against him, and yet he made that impossible shot; and\nnot only made it, but did it with absolute confidence, saying, \u201cBe ready\nto clench.\u201d Now a person like that would have undertaken that same feat\nwith a brickbat, and with Cooper to help he would have achieved it, too.\n\nPathfinder showed off handsomely that day before the ladies. His\nvery first feat was a thing which no Wild West show can touch. He was\nstanding with the group of marksmen, observing--a hundred yards from the\ntarget, mind; one Jasper raised his rifle and drove the centre of the\nbull's-eye. Then the Quartermaster fired. The target exhibited no result\nthis time. There was a laugh. \u201cIt's a dead miss,\u201d said Major Lundie.\nPathfinder waited an impressive moment or two; then said, in that calm,\nindifferent, know-it-all way of his, \u201cNo, Major, he has covered Jasper's\nbullet, as will be seen if any one will take the trouble to examine the\ntarget.\u201d\n\nWasn't it remarkable! How could he see that little pellet fly through\nthe air and enter that distant bullet-hole? Yet that is what he did; for\nnothing is impossible to a Cooper person. Did any of those people\nhave any deep-seated doubts about this thing? No; for that would imply\nsanity, and these were all Cooper people.\n\n          \u201cThe respect for Pathfinder's skill and for his 'quickness and\n          accuracy of sight'\u201d (the italics [' '] are mine) \u201cwas so\n          profound and general, that the instant he made this declaration\n          the spectators began to distrust their own opinions, and a\n          dozen rushed to the target in order to ascertain the fact.\n          There, sure enough, it was found that the Quartermaster's\n          bullet had gone through the hole made by Jasper's, and that,\n          too, so accurately as to require a minute examination to be\n          certain of the circumstance, which, however, was soon clearly\n          established by discovering one bullet over the other in the\n          stump against which the target was placed.\u201d\n\nThey made a \u201cminute\u201d examination; but never mind, how could they know\nthat there were two bullets in that hole without digging the latest one\nout? for neither probe nor eyesight could prove the presence of any\nmore than one bullet. Did they dig? No; as we shall see. It is the\nPathfinder's turn now; he steps out before the ladies, takes aim, and\nfires.\n\nBut, alas! here is a disappointment; an incredible, an unimaginable\ndisappointment--for the target's aspect is unchanged; there is nothing\nthere but that same old bullet-hole!\n\n          \u201c'If one dared to hint at such a thing,' cried Major Duncan, 'I\n          should say that the Pathfinder has also missed the target!'\u201d\n\nAs nobody had missed it yet, the \u201calso\u201d was not necessary; but never\nmind about that, for the Pathfinder is going to speak.\n\n          \u201c'No, no, Major,' said he, confidently, 'that would be a risky\n          declaration.  I didn't load the piece, and can't say what was\n          in it; but if it was lead, you will find the bullet driving\n          down those of the Quartermaster and Jasper, else is not my name\n          Pathfinder.'\n\n          \u201cA shout from the target announced the truth of this\n          assertion.\u201d\n\nIs the miracle sufficient as it stands? Not for Cooper. The Pathfinder\nspeaks again, as he \u201cnow slowly advances towards the stage occupied by\nthe females\u201d:\n\n          \u201c'That's not all, boys, that's not all; if you find the target\n          touched at all, I'll own to a miss.  The Quartermaster cut the\n          wood, but you'll find no wood cut by that last messenger.\u201d\n\nThe miracle is at last complete. He knew--doubtless saw--at the distance\nof a hundred yards--that his bullet had passed into the hole without\nfraying the edges. There were now three bullets in that one hole--three\nbullets embedded processionally in the body of the stump back of the\ntarget. Everybody knew this--somehow or other--and yet nobody had dug\nany of them out to make sure. Cooper is not a close observer, but he is\ninteresting. He is certainly always that, no matter what happens. And he\nis more interesting when he is not noticing what he is about than when\nhe is. This is a considerable merit.\n\nThe conversations in the Cooper books have a curious sound in our modern\nears. To believe that such talk really ever came out of people's mouths\nwould be to believe that there was a time when time was of no value to\na person who thought he had something to say; when it was the custom\nto spread a two-minute remark out to ten; when a man's mouth was a\nrolling-mill, and busied itself all day long in turning four-foot pigs\nof thought into thirty-foot bars of conversational railroad iron by\nattenuation; when subjects were seldom faithfully stuck to, but the talk\nwandered all around and arrived nowhere; when conversations consisted\nmainly of irrelevancies, with here and there a relevancy, a relevancy\nwith an embarrassed look, as not being able to explain how it got there.\n\nCooper was certainly not a master in the construction of dialogue.\nInaccurate observation defeated him here as it defeated him in so many\nother enterprises of his. He even failed to notice that the man who\ntalks corrupt English six days in the week must and will talk it on\nthe seventh, and can't help himself. In the Deerslayer story he lets\nDeerslayer talk the showiest kind of book-talk sometimes, and at other\ntimes the basest of base dialects. For instance, when some one asks\nhim if he has a sweetheart, and if so, where she abides, this is his\nmajestic answer:\n\n          \u201c'She's in the forest-hanging from the boughs of the trees, in\n          a soft rain--in the dew on the open grass--the clouds that\n          float about in the blue heavens--the birds that sing in the\n          woods--the sweet springs where I slake my thirst--and in all\n          the other glorious gifts that come from God's Providence!'\u201d\n\nAnd he preceded that, a little before, with this:\n\n          \u201c'It consarns me as all things that touches a fri'nd consarns a\n          fri'nd.'\u201d\n\nAnd this is another of his remarks:\n\n          \u201c'If I was Injin born, now, I might tell of this, or carry in\n          the scalp and boast of the expl'ite afore the whole tribe; or\n          if my inimy had only been a bear'\u201d--and so on.\n\nWe cannot imagine such a thing as a veteran Scotch Commander-in-Chief\ncomporting himself in the field like a windy melodramatic actor, but\nCooper could. On one occasion Alice and Cora were being chased by the\nFrench through a fog in the neighborhood of their father's fort:\n\n          \u201c'Point de quartier aux coquins!' cried an eager pursuer, who\n          seemed to direct the operations of the enemy.\n\n          \u201c'Stand firm and be ready, my gallant 60ths!' suddenly\n          exclaimed a voice above them; wait to see the enemy; fire low,\n          and sweep the glacis.'\n\n          \u201c'Father? father!' exclaimed a piercing cry from out the mist;\n          'it is I!  Alice! thy own Elsie! spare, O! save your daughters!'\n\n          \u201c'Hold!' shouted the former speaker, in the awful tones of\n          parental agony, the sound reaching even to the woods, and\n          rolling back in solemn echo.  ''Tis she! God has restored me my\n          children! Throw open the sally-port; to the field, 60ths, to\n          the field! pull not a trigger, lest ye kill my lambs!  Drive\n          off these dogs of France with your steel!'\u201d\n\nCooper's word-sense was singularly dull. When a person has a poor ear\nfor music he will flat and sharp right along without knowing it. He\nkeeps near the tune, but it is not the tune. When a person has a poor\near for words, the result is a literary flatting and sharping; you\nperceive what he is intending to say, but you also perceive that he\ndoesn't say it. This is Cooper. He was not a word-musician. His ear was\nsatisfied with the approximate word. I will furnish some circumstantial\nevidence in support of this charge. My instances are gathered from\nhalf a dozen pages of the tale called Deerslayer. He uses \u201cverbal,\u201d\n for \u201coral\u201d; \u201cprecision,\u201d for \u201cfacility\u201d; \u201cphenomena,\u201d for \u201cmarvels\u201d;\n\u201cnecessary,\u201d for \u201cpredetermined\u201d; \u201cunsophisticated,\u201d for \u201cprimitive\u201d;\n\u201cpreparation,\u201d for \u201cexpectancy\u201d; \u201crebuked,\u201d for \u201csubdued\u201d; \u201cdependent\non,\u201d for \u201cresulting from\u201d; \u201cfact,\u201d for \u201ccondition\u201d; \u201cfact,\u201d for\n\u201cconjecture\u201d; \u201cprecaution,\u201d for \u201ccaution\u201d; \u201cexplain,\u201d for \u201cdetermine\u201d;\n\u201cmortified,\u201d for \u201cdisappointed\u201d; \u201cmeretricious,\u201d for \u201cfactitious\u201d;\n\u201cmaterially,\u201d for \u201cconsiderably\u201d; \u201cdecreasing,\u201d for \u201cdeepening\u201d;\n\u201cincreasing,\u201d for \u201cdisappearing\u201d; \u201cembedded,\u201d for \u201cenclosed\u201d;\n\u201ctreacherous;\u201d for \u201chostile\u201d; \u201cstood,\u201d for \u201cstooped\u201d; \u201csoftened,\u201d for\n\u201creplaced\u201d; \u201crejoined,\u201d for \u201cremarked\u201d; \u201csituation,\u201d for \u201ccondition\u201d;\n\u201cdifferent,\u201d for \u201cdiffering\u201d; \u201cinsensible,\u201d for \u201cunsentient\u201d; \u201cbrevity,\u201d\n for \u201ccelerity\u201d; \u201cdistrusted,\u201d for \u201csuspicious\u201d; \u201cmental imbecility,\u201d\n for \u201cimbecility\u201d; \u201ceyes,\u201d for \u201csight\u201d; \u201ccounteracting,\u201d for \u201copposing\u201d;\n\u201cfuneral obsequies,\u201d for \u201cobsequies.\u201d\n\nThere have been daring people in the world who claimed that Cooper could\nwrite English, but they are all dead now--all dead but Lounsbury. I\ndon't remember that Lounsbury makes the claim in so many words, still he\nmakes it, for he says that Deerslayer is a \u201cpure work of art.\u201d Pure, in\nthat connection, means faultless--faultless in all details--and language\nis a detail. If Mr. Lounsbury had only compared Cooper's English with\nthe English which he writes himself--but it is plain that he didn't;\nand so it is likely that he imagines until this day that Cooper's is as\nclean and compact as his own. Now I feel sure, deep down in my heart,\nthat Cooper wrote about the poorest English that exists in our language,\nand that the English of Deerslayer is the very worst that even Cooper\never wrote.\n\nI may be mistaken, but it does seem to me that Deerslayer is not a work\nof art in any sense; it does seem to me that it is destitute of every\ndetail that goes to the making of a work of art; in truth, it seems to\nme that Deerslayer is just simply a literary delirium tremens.\n\nA work of art? It has no invention; it has no order, system, sequence,\nor result; it has no lifelikeness, no thrill, no stir, no seeming of\nreality; its characters are confusedly drawn, and by their acts and\nwords they prove that they are not the sort of people the author\nclaims that they are; its humor is pathetic; its pathos is funny;\nits conversations are--oh! indescribable; its love-scenes odious; its\nEnglish a crime against the language.\n\nCounting these out, what is left is Art. I think we must all admit that.",
