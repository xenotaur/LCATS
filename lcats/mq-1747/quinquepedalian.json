    "body": "It lay there, an indentation in the soil, two inches deep and nine feet\nin diameter. It was flat, it was smooth, and the sand and the dirt were\ntwined with rotted leaves and stems in a marbled pattern. The edge,\ncut sharp and clean, exposed a miniature stratum leading up to the\nunpressed forest floor, and spoke of the weight that had stood on that\nspot, molding the earth into the shape of its fundament.\n\nIt was the mark of a foot, or a hoof, or whatever it is that touched\nthe ground when an animal ambulates. One print--\n\nCharles Tinnerman shook his head somberly. A single print could have\nbeen a freak of nature. This was one of many: a definite trail. They\nwere spaced twenty or thirty feet apart, huge and level; ridges\nof spadiceous earth narrowed toward the center of each, rounded and\nsmooth, as though squirted liquidly up between half-yard toes. Some\nwere broken, toppled worms lying skew, skuffed when the hoof moved on.\n\nAround the spoor rose the forest, in Gargantuan splendor; each trunk\nascending gauntly into a mass of foliage so high and solid that the\nground was cast into an almost nocturnal shadow.\n\nAt dusk the three men halted. \"We could set up an arc,\" Tinnerman said,\nreaching behind to pat his harness.\n\nDon Abel grunted negatively. \"Use a light, and everything on the planet\nwill know where we are. We don't want the thing that made that,\" he\ngestured toward the trail, \"to start hunting us.\"\n\nThe third man spoke impatiently. \"It rains at night, remember? If we\ndon't get close pretty soon, the water'll wash out the prints.\"\n\nTinnerman looked up. \"Too late,\" he said. There was no thunder, but\nabruptly it was raining, solidly, as it must to support a forest of\nthis type. They could hear the steady deluge flaying the dense leaves\nfar above. Not a drop reached the ground.\n\n\"The trees won't hold it back forever,\" Abel remarked. \"We'd better\nbreak out the pup tent in a hurry--\"\n\n\"Hey!\" Fritz Slaker's voice sang out ahead. \"There's a banyan or\nsomething up here. Shelter!\"\n\nColumns of water hissed into the ground as the great leaves far above\noverflowed at last. The men galloped for cover, packs thumping as they\ndodged the sudden waterfalls.\n\n\n\nThey stripped their packs and broke out rations silently. The dry\nleaves and spongy loam made a comfortable seat, and after a day of\nhiking the relaxation was bliss. Tinnerman leaned back against the base\nof the nearest trunk, chewing and gazing up into the bole of the tree.\nIt was dark; but he could make out a giant spherical opacity from which\nmultiple stems projected downward, bending and swelling for a hundred\nfeet until they touched the ground as trunks twelve feet in diameter.\n\nDon Abel's voice came out of the shadow. \"The monster passed right\nunder here. I'm sitting on the edge of a print. What if it comes back?\"\n\nSlaker laughed, but not loudly. \"Mebbe we're in its nest? We'd hear it.\nA critter like that--just the shaking of the ground would knock us all\na foot into the air.\" There was a sustained rustle.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Abel asked querulously.\n\n\"Making a bed,\" Slaker snapped.\n\n\"Do you think it's safe?\" Abel asked, though his tone indicated that\nhe suspected one place was as unsafe as another. After a moment, the\nrustle signified that he too was making a bed.\n\nTinnerman smiled in the dark, amused. He really did not know the other\nmen well; the three had organized an AWOL party on the spur of the\nmoment, knowing that the survey ship would be planetbound for several\ndays.\n\nThe bark of the tree was thick and rubbery, and Tinnerman found\nit oddly comfortable. He put his ear against it, hearing a faint\nmelodic humming that seemed to emanate from the interior. It was\nas though he was auditing the actual life-processes of the alien\nvegetation--although on this world, _he_ was the alien--and this\nfascinated him.\n\nThe other two were soon asleep. Sitting there in silence, the absolute\nblackness of a strange world's umbra pressing against his eyeballs,\nTinnerman realized that this outing, dangerous as it was, offered him a\nsatisfaction he had seldom known. Slaker and Abel had accepted him for\nwhat he was not: one of the fellows.\n\nThose footprints. Obviously animal--yet so large. Would a pressure of\na hundred pounds per square inch depress the earth that much? How much\nwould the total creature weigh?\n\nTinnerman found his pack in the dark and rummaged for his miniature\nslide rule. The tiny numbers fluoresced as he set up his problem: 144\ntimes the square of 4.5 times pi divided by 20. It came to about 460\ntons per print. And how many feet did it have, and how much weight did\neach carry when at rest?\n\n\n\nHe had heard that creatures substantially larger than the dinosaurs\nof ancient Earth could not exist on land. On an Earth type planet,\nwhich this one was with regard to gravity, atmosphere and climate,\nthe limits were not so much biological as physical. A diminutive\ninsect required many legs, not to support its weight, but to preserve\nbalance. Brontosaurus, with legs many times as sturdy as those of an\ninsect, even in proportion to its size, had to seek the swamp to ease\nthe overbearing weight. A larger animal, in order to walk at all,\nwould have to have disproportionately larger legs and feet. Mass cubed\nwith increasing size while the cross section of the legs squared; to\nmaintain a feasible ratio, most of the mass above a certain point would\nhave to go to the feet.\n\nFour hundred and sixty tons? The weight on each foot exceeded that of a\nfamily of whales. Bones should shatter and flesh tear free with every\nstep.\n\nThe rain had ceased and the forest was quiet now. Tinnerman scraped\nup a belated bed of his own and lay down. But his mind refused to be\npacified. Bright and clear and ominous the thoughts paraded, posing\nquestions for which he had no answer. What thing had they blundered\nacross?\n\nA jumping animal! Tinnerman sat up, too excited to sleep. Like an\novergrown snowshoe rabbit, he thought--bounding high, hundreds of feet\nto nip the lofty greenery, then landing with terrific impact. It could\nbe quite small--less than a ton, perhaps, with one grossly splayed\nbalancing foot. At night it might sail into a selected roost ... or\n_onto_....\n\nHe turned his eyes up to the impenetrable canopy above. In the\nflattened upper reaches of the banyan ... a nest?\n\nTinnerman stood, moving silently away from the bodies of his\ncompanions. Locating his pack a second time he dug out cleats and hand\nspikes, fitting them to his body by feel. He found his trunk, shaping\nits firm curvature with both hands; then he began to ascent.\n\nHe climbed, digging the spikes into the heavy bark and gaining\naltitude in the blackness. The surface gradually became softer, more\neven, but remained firm; if it were to pull away from the inner wood\nthe fall would kill him. He felt the curvature increase and knew that\nthe diameter of the trunk was shrinking; but still there was no light\nat all.\n\nHis muscles tensed as his body seemed to become heavier, more\nprecariously exposed. Something was pulling him away from the trunk,\nweakening his purchase; but he could not yet circle any major portion\nof the column with his arms. Something was wrong; he would have to\ndescend before being torn loose.\n\nRelief washed over him as he realized the nature of the problem. He\nwas near the top; the stem was bending in to join the main body of the\ntree, and he was on the underside. He worked his way to the outside and\nthe strain eased; now gravity was pulling him into the trunk, helping\nhim instead of leaving him hanging. Quickly he completed the ascent and\nstood at last against the massive nexus where limb melded into bole.\n\n\n\nHere there was light, a dim glow from overhead. He mounted the vast\ngnarled bulk, a globular shape thirty feet in diameter covered with\nswellings and scars. It was difficult to picture it as it was, a\nhundred feet above the ground, for nothing at all could be seen beyond\nits damp mound. Although it was part of a living or once-living thing,\nthere was no evidence of foliage. There was no nest.\n\nThe center of the crude sphere rose onto another trunk or stalk, a\ncolumn about ten feet in diameter, pointing straight up as far as he\ncould see. He was not at the top at all. The bark here was smooth and\nnot very thick; it would be difficult to scale, even with the cleats.\n\nTinnerman rested for about ten minutes, lying down and putting his ear\nto the wood. Again the melody of the interior came to him, gentle yet\ndeep. It brought a vision of many layers, pulsing and interweaving; of\ntumescence and flow, rich sap in the fibers. There was life of a sort\ngoing on within, either of the tree or in it.\n\nHe stood and mounted the central stalk. Quickly he climbed, spikes\npenetrating at fingers, knees and toes, bearing him ant-like up the\nsheer column without hesitation. The light above became brighter,\nthough it was only the lesser gloom of a starless night on a moonless\nplanet. Ahead the straight trunk went on and on, narrowing but never\nbranching. Huge limbs from neighboring trees crossed nearby, bare and\neerie, residual moisture shining dully; but his climb ignored them.\nFifty feet; seventy-five; and now he was as high above the bole as it\nwas above the ground. The stem to which he clung had diminished to a\nbare five foot diameter, but rose on toward the green upper forest.\n\nTinnerman's muscles bunched once more with strain. A wind came up; or\nperhaps he had come up to it. At this height, even the slightest tug\nand sway was alarming. He reached his arms around the shaft and hung\non. Below, the spokes of other trees were a forest of their own, a\nfairyland of brush and blackness, crossing and recrossing, concealing\neverything except the slender reed he held. Above, the first leaves\nappeared, flat and heavy in the night. He climbed.\n\nSuddenly it ended. The trunk, barely three feet through, expanded\ninto a second bole shaped like an upsidedown pear with a five foot\nthickness, and stopped. Tinnerman clambered onto the top and stood\nthere, letting his weary arms relax, balancing against the sway. There\nwas nothing else--just a vegetable knob two hundred feet above the\nground. All around, the dark verdure rustled in the breeze, and the\ngloom below was a quiet sea.\n\nNo branches approached within twenty feet of the knob, though the\nleaves closed in above, diffusing the glow of the sky. Tinnerman\nstudied the hollow around him, wondering what kept the growth away. Was\nthis a takeoff point for the hidden quarry?\n\nThen it came to him, unnerving him completely. Fear hammered inside him\nlike a bottled demon; he dared not let it out. Shaking, he began the\ndescent.\n\n\n\nMorning came, dim and unwilling; but it was not the wan light filtering\ndown like sediment that woke the explorers. Nor was it the warmth of\nday, soaking into the tops and running down the trunks in the fashion\nof the night water.\n\nThey woke to sound: a distant din, as of a large animal tearing\nbranches and crunching leaves. It was the first purposeful noise they\nhad heard since entering the forest; as such, it was unnatural, and\nbrought all three to their feet in alarm.\n\nThe evening deluge had eradicated all trace of the prints leading up to\nthe giant structure under which they had taken shelter. Beneath it the\nspoor remained, as deep and fresh as before; one print near the edge\nwas half gone.\n\nSlaker sized up the situation immediately. \"Guarantees the trail was\nfresh,\" he said. \"We don't know whether it was coming or going, but it\nwas made between rains. Let's get over and spot that noise.\" He suited\naction to word and set off, pack dangling from one hand, half eaten\nspace-ration in the other.\n\nAbel was not so confident. \"Fresh, yes--but we still don't know where\nthe thing went. You don't look as though you got much sleep, Tinny.\"\n\nTinnerman didn't answer. They picked up their packs and followed\nSlaker, who was already almost out of sight.\n\nThey came up to him as he stood at the edge of an open space in the\nforest. Several mighty trees had fallen, and around their massive\ncorpses myriad little shoots were reaching up. The sunlight streamed\ndown here, intolerably bright after the obscurity underneath. The noise\nhad stopped.\n\nThere was a motion in the bush ahead. A large body was moving through\nthe thicket, just out of sight, coming toward them. A serpentine neck\npoked out of the copse, bearing a cactuslike head a foot in diameter.\nThe head swung toward them, circularly machairodont, a ring of six-inch\neye stalks extended.\n\nThe men froze, watching the creature. The head moved away, apparently\nlosing its orientation in the silence. The neck was smooth and\nflexible, about ten feet in length; the body remained out of sight.\n\n\"Look at those teeth!\" Slaker whispered fiercely. \"That's our monster.\"\n\nImmediately the head reacted, demonstrating acute hearing. It came\nforward rapidly, twenty feet above the ground; and in a moment the\nrest of the creature came into sight. The body was a globular mass\nabout four feet across, mounted on a number of spindly legs. The\ncreature walked with a peculiar caterpillar ripple, one ten-foot leg\nswinging around the body in a clockwise direction while the others\nwere stationary, reminding Tinnerman of the problems of a wounded\ndaddy-long-legs. The body spun, rotating with the legs; but the feet\nmanaged to make a kind of precessional progress. The spin did not\nappear to interfere with balance or orientation; the ring of eye-stalks\nkept all horizons covered.\n\nSlaker whipped out his sidearm. \"No!\" Tinnerman cried, too late.\nSlaker's shot smacked into the central body, making a small but visible\npuncture.\n\n\n\nThe creature halted as if non-plussed, legs rising and falling\nrhythmically in place. It did not fall. Slaker's second bullet tore\ninto it, and his third, before Tinnerman wrested away the gun. \"It\nwasn't attacking,\" he said, not knowing how to explain what he knew.\n\nThey watched while the monster's motion gradually slowed, huge drops\nof ichor welling from its wounds. It shuddered; then the legs began\npounding the ground in short, violent steps, several at a time.\nCoordination was gone; slowly the body over-balanced and toppled.\nThe great mouth opened like a flower, like a horn, and emitted an\nearshattering blast of sound, a tormented cry of pain and confusion;\nthen the body fell heavily on its side.\n\nFor a moment the three men stood in silence, watching the death throes.\nThe creature's legs writhed as though independently alive, and the\nhead twisted savagely on the ground, knocking off the oddly brittle\neye-stalks. Tinnerman's heart sank, for the killing had been pointless.\nIf he had told the others his nighttime revelation--\n\nFrom the forest came a blast of incredible volume. Tinnerman clapped\nboth hands over his ears as the siren stridence deafened them with a\npower of twelve to fifteen bels.\n\nIt ended, leaving a wake of silence. It had been a call, similar to\nthat of the creature just shot, but deeper and much louder. There was a\nlarger monster in the forest, answering the call for help.\n\n\"Its mate?\" Abel wondered out loud, his voice sounding thin.\n\n\"Its mother!\" Tinnerman said succinctly. \"And I think we'd better hide.\"\n\nSlaker shrugged. \"Bullets will stop it,\" he said.\n\nTinnerman and Abel forged into the brush without comment. Slaker stood\nhis ground confidently, aiming his weapon in the general direction of\nthe approaching footfalls.\n\nOnce more the fog-horn voice sounded, impossibly loud, forcing all\nthree to cover their ears before drums shattered and brains turned to\njelly. Slaker could be seen ahead, one arm wrapped around his head to\nprotect both ears, the other waving the gun.\n\nThe ground shook. High foliage burst open and large trees swayed aside,\ntheir branches crashing to the ground. A shape vast beyond imagination\nthundered into the clearing.\n\nFor a moment it paused, a four legged monster a hundred feet high. Its\nlow head was twelve feet thick, with a flat shiny snout. A broad eye\nopened, several feet across, casting about myopically. A ring of fibers\nsprouted, each pencil-thick, flexing slightly as the head moved.\n\nSlaker fired.\n\nThe head shot forward, thudding into the ground thirty feet in front\nof him. The body moved, rotating grandly, as another member lifted and\nswung forward. They were not heads, but feet! Five feet with eyes. The\nmonster was a hugely sophisticated adult of the quinquepedalian species\nSlaker had killed.\n\n\n\nThe man finally saw the futility of his stand, and ran. The towering\ngiant followed, feet jarring the ground with rhythmic impacts,\nhoofs leaving nine-foot indents. It spun majestically, a dance of\nterrible gravity, pounding the brush and trees and dirt beneath it\ninto nothingness. As each foot lifted, the heavy skin rolled back,\nuncovering the eye, and the sensory fibrils shot out. As each foot\nfell, the hide wrinkled closed, protecting the organs from the shock of\nimpact.\n\nThe creature was slow, but its feet were fast. The fifth fall came down\non the running figure, and Slaker was gone.\n\nThe quinquepedalian hesitated, one foot raised, searching. It was aware\nof them; it would not allow the killers of its child to escape. The eye\nroved, socketless, its glassy stare directed by a slow twisting of the\nfoot. The circle of filaments combed the air, feeling for a sound or\nsmell, or whatever trace of the fugitives they were adapted to detect.\n\nAfter a few minutes the eye closed and the fibrils withdrew. The foot\nwent high; plummeted. The earth rocked with the force of the blow. It\nlifted again, to smash down a few feet over, leaving a tangent print.\n\nAfter a dozen such stomps the creature reversed course and came back,\nmaking a second row ahead of the first. This, Tinnerman realized, was\ncarpet-bombing; and the two men were directly in the swath.\n\nIf they ran, the five-footed nemesis would cut them down easily. If\nthey stayed, it would get them anyway, unless one or both of them\nhappened to be fortunate enough to fit into the diamond between four\nprints. The odds were negative. And quite possibly it would sense a\nnear miss, and rectify the error with a small extra tap.\n\nThey waited, motionless, while it laid down another barrage, and\nanother. Now it was within fifty feet, mechanically covering the area.\nBehind it a flat highway was developing.\n\nSaturation stomping, Tinnerman thought, and found the concept insanely\nfunny. Man discovers a unique five-footed monster--the Quink--and it\nsteps on him. Would the history books record the irony?\n\nHe saw the answer. He gave a cry and lurched to his feet, flinging his\npack aside and plunging directly at the monster.\n\nThe foot halted, quite fast on the uptake, and rotated its eye\nto cover him. It gathered itself, crashed down, an irresistible\njuggernaut. The earth jumped with its fury; but Tinnerman, running in\nan unexpected direction, had passed its arc.\n\nHe halted directly under the main body of the quinquepedalian. If his\nguess were correct, it would be unable to reach him there. It would\nhave to move--and he would move with it.\n\nFar above, the main body hovered, a black boulder suspended on\ntoothpicks. Above that, he knew, the neck and head extended on into the\nsky. A head shaped like a pear--when its mouth was closed. The first\nfoot turned inward, its eye bearing on him. It hung there, several\nfeet above the ground, studying him with disquieting intelligence. It\ndid not try to pin him. Balance, Tinnerman judged, was after all of\nparamount importance to a creature two hundred feet tall. If it lost\nits footing, the fall of its body would destroy it. So long as it kept\nthree or four feet correctly positioned and firmly planted, it could\nnot fall; but if it were to pull its members into too small a circle it\ncould get into serious trouble. Several hundred tons are not lightly\ntossed about.\n\n\n\nThe quinquepedalian moved. The feet swung clockwise, one at a time,\nstriking the ground with an elephantine touch. The bars of Tinnerman's\ncage lifted and fell, crushing the terrain with an almost musical\nbeat; the body turned, gaining momentum. The feet on one side seemed\nto retreat; on the other they advanced, forcing him to walk rapidly to\nkeep himself centered.\n\nThe pace increased. Now the feet landed just seconds apart, spinning\nthe vast body forward. Tinnerman had to break into a run.\n\nSmall trees impeded his progress; every time he dodged around an\nobstruction, the hind feet gained. On an open plain he might have been\nable to outrun the monster; but now it had maneuvered him onto rough\nground. If it didn't tire soon, it would have him. In time it could\nforce him over a cliff that its own legs could straddle, or into a bog.\nOr it might forget him and go after Abel--and he would have to stay\nunder it, not daring to place himself outside its circle. His respect\nfor it mounted; he was in the eye of a hurricane, and would soon have\nto find some other place of safety.\n\nTinnerman studied the pattern of motion. At this velocity, the\nindividual feet did not have time for more than peremptory adjustments;\nthe maintenance of forward motion dictated an involved but predictable\npattern. One foot had to vacate the spot for the next; he was not sure\nwhether two feet ever left the ground at the same time, but could see\nsharp limitations. If he were to cross a print just vacated--\n\nHe timed his approach and took off to the side, almost touching the\nascending foot. It twisted in flight, its eye spotting him quickly;\nbut it was unable to act immediately. It struck the ground far ahead,\ncasting up debris with the force of its braking action, and the\nfollowing member lifted in pursuit.\n\nTinnerman ran straight out at breakneck speed. He had underestimated\nQuink's versatility; the second foot went after him much more alertly\nthan an ordinary nervous system should have permitted. In a creature\nof this size, many seconds should have elapsed before the brain\nassimilated the new information and decided upon a course of action;\nyet the feet seemed to react promptly with individual intelligence.\nThis thing was far too large and far-flung for the operation of any\neffective nervous system--yet it operated most effectively.\n\nThe shadow of a leg passed over him, and Tinnerman thought for a\ndetached moment that he had been caught. But the impact was twenty feet\nto his rear. The next one would get him, unless--\n\nHe cut sharply toward a medium large tree at the edge of the clearing.\nHe dared not look; but he was sure the creature behind was milling in\ntemporary confusion. It could not dodge as fast as he--he hoped.\n\nHe reached the tree and ducked behind its fifteen foot diameter,\nfeeling safe for the moment.\n\n\n\nQuink brought up before the tree. One foot quested around the side,\nsearching for him. He could see its enormously thick hoof, completely\nflat on the underside: polished steel, with a reddish tinge in the\ncenter. Probably natural coloration; but he thought of Slaker, and\nshuddered.\n\nThe wooden skin drew back, uncovering the eye. The ankle above the hoof\nwidened, the skin bunching in a great roll. He knew now that it settled\nwhen the foot rested, coming down to make contact with the ground. He\nhad rested against that swelling last night; he had climbed that leg....\n\nAs though satisfied that it could not reach him so long as he hid\nbehind the tree, the quinquepedalian paused for an odd shuffle.\nTinnerman peeked around the trunk and saw the legs bunch together in\na fashion that destroyed some previous theories, then spread out in\na trapezoidal formation. One foot hung near the tree, supporting no\nweight, and seemingly over-balancing the body somewhat. Then the near\nfoot hefted itself high, swinging like a pendulum, and threw itself\nagainst the tree with resounding force.\n\nThe entire trunk reverberated with the blow, and a shower of twigs and\nleaves fluttered down from the upper reaches. The foot struck again,\nhigher; again the tree quaked and loosed a larger fall of detritus.\nTinnerman kept a cautious eye on it; he could be laid low by a\ncomparatively small branch.\n\nThe single foot continued its attack, striking the tree regularly about\nfifty feet above the ground. At that height the foot was about the same\ndiameter as the tree, and the weight behind it was formidable. Yet such\naction seemed pointless, because damage to the tree would not affect\nthe man behind it.\n\nOr was he underestimating Quink again?\n\nThe pounding ceased, and he poked his head cautiously around once more.\nWas the thing retreating? Somehow he did not expect it to give up\neasily; it had demonstrated too much savvy and determination for that.\nIt was a remarkable animal, not only for its size.\n\nThree legs stood in a tripod, while two came up simultaneously.\nTinnerman's brow wrinkled; it did not seem possible for it to maintain\nits balance that way. But it was acting with assurance; it had\nsomething in mind.\n\nThe two feet rose, together, one held just above the other. In awe,\nTinnerman watched the lofty body topple forward, unable to stand\nupright in such a position. Suddenly the two feet thrust forward with\nstaggering power; the entire body rocked backward as they smashed into\nthe tree. And this time the timber felt it. A gunshot explosion rent\nthe air as the fibers of the trunk split and severed, wood splaying;\nand the large roots broke the ground like sea monsters as the entire\ntree hinged on its roots.\n\nNow Tinnerman could see how the clearing had been formed. The parent\nopened a hole in the forest, so that the baby could feed on the little\nsaplings. As the vegetation grew, so did the child, until tall enough\nto reach the foliage of full sized trees.\n\nA few more blows would fell this one. Tinnerman waited for the next\nimpact, then fled, hidden from view, he hoped, by the tilting trunk.\nThe creature continued its attack, unaware that the real quarry had\ngone.\n\n\n\nTinnerman picked up the trail, human prints this time. Abel should have\nescaped during the distraction, and would be heading for the ship.\n\nThe mighty forest was quiet now, except for a slight rustle ahead.\nThat would be Abel. Tinnerman moved without noise instinctively,\ndisinclined to interrupt the medication of the great trees' eternal\nbeauty. And knew that he was a fool, for the forest hardly cared, and\nthe quinquepedalian, with all its decibels, would not worry about the\ndistant patter of Human feet.\n\n\"Don,\" he called, not loudly. Abel turned at once, a smile on his face.\n\n\"Tinny! I'm glad you got away.\" He too was careful of his volume;\nprobably the monster could not hear, but it was pointless to ask for\ntrouble. \"You seemed to know what you were doing. But I was afraid you\nhad not made it. I would have waited for you if--\"\n\n\"I know, Don.\" Abel was no coward; if there had been any way to help,\nhe would have done so. When dealing with the quinquepedalian, loitering\nwas futile and dangerous; the person involved either got away or he did\nnot. The most practical recourse was to trek immediately for the ship,\nso that at least one person would live to tell the story.\n\n\"Ship takes off in twelve hours,\" Abel said, shaking his pack into\ngreater comfort. \"If we move right along, we can make it in six hours.\nCan't be more than twenty miles.\"\n\n\"Going to make a full report, Don?\" Tinnerman was uneasy, without being\ncertain why.\n\n\"Fritz was killed,\" Abel said simply.\n\nTinnerman put out a hand and brought him to a stop. \"We can't do it,\nDon.\"\n\nAbel studied him with concern. \"I'll give you a hand, if you got\nclipped. I thought you were O.K.\"\n\n\"I'm all right. Don, we killed that thing's baby. It did what any\nparent would do. If we report it, the captain will lift ship and fry it\nwith the main jet.\"\n\n\"Code of space, Tinny. Anything that attacks a man--\"\n\n\"It didn't attack. It came to the defense of its child. We don't have\nthe right to sentence it.\"\n\nAbel's eyes grew cold. \"Fritz was my friend. I thought he was yours\ntoo. If I could have killed that monster myself, I'd have done it. You\ncoming along?\"\n\n\"Sorry, Don. I have no quarrel with you. But I can't let you report\nQuink to the captain.\"\n\nAbel sized him up, then took off his pack. He didn't ask questions. \"If\nthat's the way it has to be,\" he said evenly.\n\n\n\nDon Abel was a slow man, cautious in his language and conservative in\naction. But he had never been mistaken for a weakling. His fists were\nlike lightning.\n\nTinnerman was knocked back by two blows to the chin and a roundhouse on\nthe ear. He held back, parrying with his forearm; Abel landed a solid\npunch to the midriff, bringing down his guard, and followed that with a\nbruising smack directly on the mouth. Tinnerman feinted with his left,\nbut got knocked off his feet with a body check before getting a chance\nto connect with his right.\n\nHe rolled over, grasping for the feet, and got lifted by a blinding\nknee to the chin. His head reeled with a red haze; and still the blows\nfell, pounding his head and neck, while Abel's foot stunned the large\nmuscle of the thigh, aiming for the groin.\n\nTinnerman's reticence fell aside, and he began to fight. He bulled\nupward, ignoring the punishment, and flung his arms around the other\nman's waist. Abel retaliated with a double handed judo chop to the back\nof the neck; but he held on, linking his forearms in a bearhug, pulling\nforward. Abel took a fistful of hair, jerking Tinnerman's head from\nside to side; but slowly the hug lifted him off his feet.\n\nAbel was free suddenly, using a body motion Tinnerman hadn't met\nbefore, and once again fists flew.\n\nIt took about fifteen minutes. Abel finally lay panting on the ground,\nexhausted but conscious, while Tinnerman rummaged in the pack for first\naid. \"I knew you could take me,\" Abel said. \"It had to be fast, or that\ndamn endurance of yours would figure in. You ever been tired in your\nlife, Tinny?\"\n\nTinnerman handed him the sponge, to clean up the blood. \"Last night I\nclimbed the Quink,\" he said. \"I stood on its head--and it never made a\nmotion.\"\n\n\"Quink? Oh, you mean the monster.\" Abel sat up suddenly. \"Are you\ntrying to tell me--\" A look of awe came over his face. \"That thing with\nthe legs, the big one--you mean we slept under--\" He paused for more\nreflection. \"Those tracks--it does figure. If it hadn't been so dark,\nwe would have seen that the monster was still standing in them! That's\nwhy there were leaves under there, and a couple of prints from the\nfront feet. It must have been asleep....\" His mind came belatedly to\ngrips with the second problem. \"You _climbed_ it?\"\n\nTinnerman nodded soberly. \"It couldn't have slept through that. I used\nthe spikes.... I didn't catch on until I saw the way the leaves had\nbeen eaten around the head. All it had to do was open its mouth--but it\nlet me go. Live and let live.\"\n\nAbel came to his feet. \"O.K., Charlie--we'll wait six hours before\nheading for the ship. That'll give us time to look this thing over.\nDon't get me wrong--I haven't made up my mind. I may still tell the\ncaptain ... but not right away.\"\n\nTinnerman relaxed. \"Let's see what we can learn,\" he said. He\nreassembled Abel's pack, then glanced up.\n\n\n\nThe foot was there, poised with Damoclesian ponderosity fifteen\nfeet above their heads. The eye was open, fibrils extended. The\nquinquepedalian had come upon them silently.\n\n\"Split!\" Tinnerman yelled. The two men dived in opposite directions.\nOnce more the ground bounced with concussion, as he raced for the\nnearest tree. He slid around it, safe for the moment.\n\nA glance back showed the monster hauling its foot back into the air.\nOnly half of Don Abel had made it to safety. Then the huge hoof hovered\nand dropped, and the grisly sight was gone. There was only another flat\nprint in the earth.\n\nAbel might have been fast enough, if he hadn't been weakened by the\nfight. Just as Slaker would have been more careful, had he been warned.\nThe quinquepedalian was the agent; but Tinnerman knew that he was the\ncause of the two deaths.\n\nNow Quink approached the tree, spinning in her stately dance, hoofs\nkissing the shadowed ground without a sound. She stood.\n\nWhy hadn't she crushed them both as they fought, oblivious to the\ndanger above? She must have been there for several minutes, watching,\nlistening. One gentle stomp, and vengeance would have been complete.\nWhy had she waited?\n\nFair play?\n\nWas this thing really intelligent? Did it have ethics of its own--her\nown?\n\nThe familiar foot came around the trunk, perceptors out. He stood\ncalmly, knowing that he was safe from immediate harm. He stooped to\npick up a handful of dirt, tossing it at the light sensitive area. The\neye folded shut immediately, letting the earth rattle over the bare\nhide. Fast reflexes.\n\nToo fast. An animal of this size had to be handicapped by the distance\nbetween brain and appendages. It was manifestly impossible to have an\ninstantaneous reflex at the end of a limb one hundred feet long. No\nneural track could provide anything like the speed he had witnessed.\n\nTinnerman moved to the other side of the trunk, as though getting\nready for a dash to another tree. The foot swung around at once,\nintercepting him from the other direction, there was no doubt that it\nlearned from experience, and could act on it immediately.\n\nBut how could that impulse travel from eye to brain and back again\nso quickly? Usually, an animal's eye was situated quite close to the\nbrain, to cut down neural delay. Unless Quink had a brain in her foot--\n\nThe answer struck him stunningly. There _was_ a brain in the foot.\nThere had to be. How else could the pedal members be placed so\naccurately, while maintaining perfect balance? There would be a\ncoordinating ganglia in the central body, issuing general orders\nconcerning overall motion and order of precedence for the lifting\nof the feet; there could be another small brain in the head, to\nhandle ingestion and vocalization. And each foot would make its own\ndecisions as to exact placement and manner of descent. Seven brains in\nall--organized into a mighty whole.\n\nThe foot-brains could sleep when not on duty, firmly planted in the\nground and covered by a thick overlap of impervious skin. They were\nprobably not too bright as individuals--their job was specialized--but\nwith the far more powerful central brain to back them up, any part of\nQuink was intelligent.\n\n\"Creature of the forest,\" Tinnerman said to it in wonder.\n\"Quinquepedalian, septecerebrian--you are probably smarter than I.\" And\ncertainly stronger. He thought about that, discovering a weird pleasure\nin the contemplation of it. All his life he had remained aloof from his\nfellows, searching for something he could honestly look up to. Now he\nhad found it.\n\n\n\nEleven hours later, on schedule, the ship took off. It would be three,\nfour, five years before a squat colony ship came to set up frontier\noperations.\n\nQuink was stalking him with ageless determination and rapidly\nincreasing sagacity. Already she had learned to anticipate the\ngeometric patterns he traced. He had led her through a simple square,\ntriangle and star, giving up each figure when she solved it and set her\nbody to intercept him ahead. Soon she would come to the conclusion that\nthe prey was something more than a vicious rodent. Once she realized\nthat she was dealing with intelligence, communication could begin.\n\nPerhaps in time she would forgive him for the death of her child, and\nknow that vengeance had been doubly extracted already. The time might\ncome when he could walk in the open once more and not be afraid of a\nfoot. At night, while she slept, he was safe; but by day--\n\nPerhaps, when the colonists came, they would be greeted by a man riding\nthe mightiest steed of all time. Or by the quinquepedalian, carrying\nits pet. It did not matter who was ascendant, so long as the liaison\nwas established.\n\n\"Creature of the forest,\" he said again, doubling back as he perceived\nher bulk in wait at an intersection of the triquetra pattern. For a\nmoment he stood and looked at her, so vast and beautiful, spinning in\nthe dance of his destruction. \"Creature of the forest,\" he said, \"Thou\nart mighty.\n\n\"Thou art mightier than I.\" There was an answering blast bels in\nmagnitude, like a goddess awakening beyond the horizon.\n\n\n                                THE END",
