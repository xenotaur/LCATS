    "body": "Joseph Heidel looked slowly around the dinner table at the five men,\nhiding his examination by a thin screen of smoke from his cigar. He was\na large man with thick blond-gray hair cut close to his head. In three\nmore months he would be fifty-two, but his face and body had the vital\nlook of a man fifteen years younger. He was the President of the\nSuperior Council, and he had been in that post--the highest post on the\noccupied planet of Mars--four of the six years he had lived here. As his\neyes flicked from one face to another his fingers unconsciously tapped\nthe table, making a sound like a miniature drum roll.\n\nOne. Two. Three. Four. Five. Five top officials, selected, tested,\nscreened on Earth to form the nucleus of governmental rule on Mars.\n\nHeidel's bright narrow eyes flicked, his fingers drummed. Which one? Who\nwas the imposter, the ringer? Who was the Martian?\n\nSadler's dry voice cut through the silence: \"This is not just an\nordinary meeting then, Mr. President?\"\n\nHeidel's cigar came up and was clamped between his teeth. He stared into\nSadler's eyes. \"No, Sadler, it isn't. This is a very special meeting.\"\nHe grinned around the cigar. \"This is where we take the clothes off the\nsheep and find the wolf.\"\n\nHeidel watched the five faces. Sadler, Meehan, Locke, Forbes, Clarke.\nOne of them. Which one?\n\n\"I'm a little thick tonight,\" said Harry Locke. \"I didn't follow what\nyou meant.\"\n\n\"No, no, of course not,\" Heidel said, still grinning. \"I'll explain it.\"\nHe could feel himself alive at that moment, every nerve singing, every\nmuscle toned. His brain was quick and his tongue rolled the words out\nsmoothly. This was the kind of situation Heidel handled best. A tense,\ndramatic situation, full of atmosphere and suspense.\n\n\"Here it is,\" Heidel continued, \"simply and briefly.\" He touched the\ncigar against an ash tray, watching with slitted shining eyes while the\nashes spilled away from the glowing tip. He bent forward suddenly. \"We\nhave an imposter among us, gentlemen. A spy.\"\n\nHe waited, holding himself tense against the table, letting the sting of\nhis words have their effect. Then he leaned back, carefully. \"And\ntonight I am going to expose this imposter. Right here, at this table.\"\nHe searched the faces again, looking for a tell-tale twitch of a muscle,\na movement of a hand, a shading in the look of an eye.\n\nThere were only Sadler, Meehan, Locke, Forbes, Clarke, looking like\nthemselves, quizzical, polite, respecting.\n\n\"One of us, you say,\" Clarke said noncommittally, his phrase neither a\nquestion nor a positive statement.\n\n\"That is true,\" said Heidel.\n\n\"Bit of a situation at that,\" said Forbes, letting a faint smile touch\nhis lips.\n\n\"Understatement, Forbes,\" Heidel said. \"Understatement.\"\n\n\"Didn't mean to sound capricious,\" Forbes said, his smile gone.\n\n\"Of course not,\" Heidel said.\n\nEdward Clarke cleared his throat. \"May I ask, sir, how this was\ndiscovered and how it was narrowed down to the Superior Council?\"\n\n\"Surely,\" Heidel said crisply. \"No need to go into the troubles we've\nbeen having. You know all about that. But how these troubles originated\nis the important thing. Do you remember the missionary affair?\"\n\n\"When we were going to convert the Eastern industrial section?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Heidel said, remembering. \"Horrible massacre.\"\n\n\"Bloody,\" agreed John Meehan.\n\n\"Sixty-seven missionaries lost,\" Heidel said.\n\n\"I remember the Martian note of apology,\" Forbes said. \"'We have\nworshipped our own God for two-hundred thousand years. We would prefer\nto continue. Thank you.' Blinking nerve, eh?\"\n\n\"Neither here nor there,\" Heidel said abruptly. \"The point is that no\none _knew_ those sixty-seven men were missionaries except myself and you\nfive men.\"\n\n\n\nHeidel watched the faces in front of him. \"One case,\" he said. \"Here's\nanother. Do you recall when we outlawed the free selection system?\"\n\n\"Another bloody one,\" said Sadler.\n\n\"Forty-eight victims in that case,\" Heidel said. \"Forty-eight honorable\ncolonists, sanctioned by us to legally marry any couple on the planet,\nand sent out over the country to abolish the horrible free-love\nsituation.\"\n\n\"Forty-eight justices of the peace dead as pickerels,\" Forbes said.\n\n\"Do you happen to remember _that_ note of apology?\" Heidel asked, a\nslight edge in his voice. He examined Forbes' eyes.\n\n\"Matter of fact, yes,\" said Forbes, returning Heidel's stare steadily.\n\"'You love your way, we'll love ours.' Terribly caustic, what?\"\n\n\"Terribly,\" said Heidel. \"Although that too is neither here nor there.\nThe point again, no one except the six of us right here knew what those\nforty-eight men were sent out to do.\"\n\nHeidel straightened in his chair. The slow grating voice of Forbes had\ntaken some of the sharpness out of the situation. He wanted to hold\ntheir attention minutely, so that when he was ready, the dramatics of\nhis action would be tense and telling.\n\n\"There is no use,\" he said, \"in going into the details of the other\nincidents. You remember them. When we tried to install a free press, the\nSensible Art galleries, I-Am-A-Martian Day, wrestling, and all the\nrest.\"\n\n\"I remember the wrestling business awfully well,\" said Forbes. \"Martians\ndrove a wrestler through the street in a yellow jetmobile. Had flowers\naround his neck and a crown on his head. He was dead, of course.\nStuffed, I think....\"\n\n\"All right,\" snapped Heidel. \"Each one of our efforts to offer these\npeople a chance to benefit from our culture was snapped off at the bud.\nAnd only a leak in the Superior Council could have caused it. It is a\nsimple matter of deduction. There is one of us, here tonight, who is\nresponsible. And I am going to expose him.\" Heidel's voice was a low\nvibrant sound that echoed in the large dining room.\n\nThe five men waited. Forbes, his long arms crossed. Sadler, his eyes on\nhis fingernails. Meehan, blinking placidly. Clarke, twirling his thumbs.\nLocke, examining his cigarette.\n\n\"Kessit!\" Heidel called.\n\nA gray-haired man in a black butler's coat appeared.\n\n\"We'll have our wine now,\" Heidel said. There was a slight quirk in his\nmouth, so that his teeth showed between his lips. The butler moved\nmethodically from place to place, pouring wine from a silver decanter.\n\n\"Now then, Kessit,\" Heidel said, when the butler had finished, \"would\nyou be kind enough to fetch me that little pistol from the mantel over\nthere?\" He smiled outwardly this time. The situation was right again; he\nwas handling things, inch by inch, without interruption.\n\nHe took the gun from the old man's hands. \"One thing more, Kessit. Would\nyou please light the candles on the table and turn out the rest of the\nlights in the room. I've always been a romanticist,\" Heidel said,\nsmiling around the table. \"Candlelight with my wine.\"\n\n\"Oh, excellent,\" said Locke soberly.\n\n\"Quite,\" said Forbes.\n\nHeidel nodded and waited while the butler lit the candles and snapped\noff the overhead lights. The yellow flames wavered on the table as the\ndoor closed gently behind the butler.\n\n\"Now, then,\" Heidel said, feeling the tingling in his nerves. \"This,\ngentlemen, is a replica of an antique of the twentieth century. A\nworking replica, I might add. It was called a P-38, if my memory serves\nme.\" He held the pistol up so that the candlelight reflected against the\nglistening black handle and the blue barrel.\n\nThere was a polite murmur as the five men stretched forward to look at\nthe gun in Heidel's hands.\n\n\"Crude,\" Sadler said.\n\n\"But devilish-looking,\" Forbes added.\n\n\"My hobby,\" Heidel said. \"I would like to add that not only do I collect\nthese small arms, but I am very adept at using them. Something I will\ndemonstrate to you very shortly,\" he added, grinning.\n\n\"Say now,\" nodded Meehan.\n\n\"That should be jolly,\" Forbes said, laughing courteously.\n\n\"I believe it will at that,\" Heidel said. \"Now if you will notice,\ngentlemen,\" he said touching the clip ejector of the pistol and watching\nthe black magazine slip out into his other hand. \"I have but five\ncartridges in the clip. Just five. You see?\"\n\nThey all bent forward, blinking.\n\n\"Good,\" said Heidel, shoving the clip back into the grip of the gun. He\ncouldn't keep his lips from curling in his excitement, but his hands\nwere as steady as though his nerves had turned to ice.\n\nThe five men leaned back in their chairs.\n\n\"Now then, Meehan,\" he said to the man at the opposite end of the table.\n\"Would you mind moving over to your left, so that the end of the table\nis clear?\"\n\n\"Oh?\" said Meehan. \"Yes, of course.\" He grinned at the others, and there\nwas a ripple of amusement as Meehan slid his chair to the left.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Heidel. \"All pretty foolish-looking, perhaps. But it won't\nbe in a few minutes when I discover the bastard of a Martian who's in\nthis group, I'll tell you that!\" His voice rose and rang in the room,\nand he brought the glistening pistol down with a crack against the\ntable.\n\n\n\nThere was dead silence and Heidel found his smile again. \"All right, now\nI'll explain a bit further. Before Dr. Kingly, the head of our\nlaboratory, died a few days ago, he made a very peculiar discovery. As\nyou know, there has been no evidence to indicate that the Martian is any\ndifferent, physically, from the Earthman. Not until Dr. Kingly made his\ndiscovery, that is.\"\n\nHeidel looked from face to face. \"This is how it happened,\" he went on.\n\"Dr. Kingly ...\"\n\nHe paused and glanced about in false surprise. \"I beg your pardon,\ngentlemen. We might as well be enjoying our wine. Excellent port. Very\nold, I believe. Shall we?\" he asked, raising his glass.\n\nFive other glasses shimmered in the candlelight.\n\n\"Let us, ah, toast success to the unveiling of the rotten Martian who\nsits among us, shall we?\" Heidel's smile glinted and he drank a quarter\nof his glass.\n\nThe five glasses tipped and were returned to the table. Again there was\nsilence as the men waited.\n\n\"To get back,\" Heidel said, listening with excitement to his own voice.\n\"Dr. Kingly, in the process of an autopsy on a derelict Martian, made a\nrather startling discovery ...\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" Forbes said. \"Did you say autopsy?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Heidel. \"We've done this frequently. Not according to base\norders, you understand.\" He winked. \"But a little infraction now and\nthen is necessary.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Forbes. \"I just didn't know about that.\"\n\n\"No, you didn't, did you?\" said Heidel, looking at Forbes closely. \"At\nany rate, Dr. Kingly had developed in his work a preserving solution\nwhich he used in such instances, thereby prolonging the time for\nexamination of the cadaver, without experiencing deterioration of the\ntissues. This solution was merely injected into the blood stream,\nand ...\"\n\n\"Sorry again, sir,\" Forbes said. \"But you said blood stream?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Heidel nodded. \"This had to be done before the cadaver was a\ncadaver, you see?\"\n\n\"I think so, yes,\" said Forbes, leaning back again. \"Murdered the\nbastard for an autopsy, what?\"\n\nHeidel's fingers closed around the pistol. \"I don't like that, Forbes.\"\n\n\"Terribly sorry, sir.\"\n\n\"To get on,\" Heidel said finally, his voice a cutting sound. \"Dr. Kingly\nhad injected his solution and then ... Well, at any rate, when he\nreturned to his laboratory, it was night. His laboratory was black as\npitch--I'm trying to paint the picture for you, gentlemen--and the\ncadaver was stretched out on a table, you see. And before Dr. Kingly\nswitched on the lights, he saw the eyes of this dead Martian glowing in\nthe dark like a pair of hot coals.\"\n\n\"Weird,\" said Sadler, unblinking.\n\n\"Ghostly,\" said Clarke.\n\n\"The important thing,\" Heidel said curtly, \"is that Dr. Kingly\ndiscovered the difference, then, between the Martian and the Earthman.\nThe difference is the eyes. The solution, you see, had reacted\nchemically to the membranes of the eyeballs, so that as it happened\nthey lit up like electric lights. I won't go into what Dr. Kingly found\nfurther, when he dissected the eyeballs. Let it suffice to say, the\nMartian eyeball is a physical element entirely different from our\nown--at least from those of five of us, I should say.\"\n\nHis grin gleamed. He was working this precisely and carefully, and it\nwas effective. \"Now, however,\" he continued, \"it is this _sixth_ man who\nis at issue right now. The fly in the soup, shall we say. And in just a\nfew seconds I am going to exterminate that fly.\"\n\nHe picked up the pistol from the table. \"As I told you, gentlemen, I am\nquite versatile with this weapon. I am a dead shot, in other words. And\nI am going to demonstrate it to you.\" He glanced from face to face.\n\n\"You will notice that since Mr. Meehan has moved, I have a clear field\nacross the table. I don't believe a little lead in the woodwork will mar\nthe room too much, would you say, Forbes?\"\n\nForbes sat very still. \"No, I shouldn't think so, sir.\"\n\n\"Good. Because I am going to snuff out each of the four candles in the\ncenter of this table by shooting the wick away. You follow me,\ngentlemen? Locke? Meehan? Sadler?\"\n\nHeads nodded.\n\n\"Then perhaps you are already ahead of me. When the last candle is\nextinguished, we will have darkness, you see. And then I think we'll\nfind our Martian rat. Because, as a matter of fact,\" Heidel lolled his\nwords, \"I have taken the privilege of adding to the wine we have been\ndrinking Dr. Kingly's preserving solution. Non-tasteful, non-harmful.\nExcept, that is, to one man in this room.\"\n\nHeidel motioned his gun. \"And God rest the bastard's soul, because if\nyou will remember, I have five bullets in the chamber of this pistol.\nFour for the candles and one for the brain of the sonofabitch whose eyes\nlight up when the last candle goes out.\"\n\n\n\nThere was a steady deadly silence while the flames of the candles licked\nat the still air.\n\n\"I think, however,\" Heidel said, savoring the moment, \"that we should\nhave one final toast before we proceed.\" He lifted his glass. \"May the\nreceiver of the fifth bullet go straight to hell. I phrase that\nliterally, gentlemen,\" he said, laughing. \"Drink up!\"\n\nThe glasses were drained and placed again on the table.\n\n\"Watch carefully,\" Heidel said and lifted the pistol. He aimed at the\nfirst candle. The trigger was taut against his finger, the explosion\nloud in the room.\n\n\"One,\" said Heidel.\n\nHe aimed again. The explosion.\n\n\"Two,\" he said. \"Rather good, eh?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" Sadler said.\n\n\"Quite,\" said Forbes.\n\n\"Again,\" said Heidel. A third shot echoed.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, pointing the muzzle at the last candle. \"I would say\nthis is it, wouldn't you, gentlemen? And as soon as this one goes, I'm\nafraid one of us is going to find a bullet right between his goddam\nsparkling eyes. Are you ready?\"\n\nHe squinted one eye and looked down the sights. He squeezed the trigger,\nthe room echoed and there was blackness. Heidel held his pistol poised\nover the table.\n\nSilence.\n\n\"Well,\" said Forbes finally. \"There you have it. Surprise, what?\"\n\nHeidel balanced the pistol, feeling his palm go suddenly moist against\nthe black grip, and he looked around at the five pairs of glowing eyes.\n\n\"Bit of a shock, I should imagine,\" Forbes said. \"Discovering all of us,\nas it were.\"\n\nHeidel licked his lips. \"How? _How_ could you do this?\"\n\nForbes remained motionless. \"Simple as one, you know. Put men on rockets\ngoing back to Earth in place of returning colonists. Study. Observe.\nLearn. Shift a record here and there. Forge, change pictures, all that\nsort of thing. Poor contact between here and Earth, you know. Not too\ndifficult.\"\n\n\"I'll get one of you,\" Heidel said, still balancing his pistol tightly.\n\n\"Well, possibly,\" Forbes said. \"But no more than one. You have three\nguns pointed at you. We can see you perfectly, you know, as though it\nwere broad daylight. One shiver of that pistol, and you're dead.\"\n\n\"Why have you done this?\" Heidel said suddenly. \"_Why?_ Everything that\nwas done was for the Martian. We tried to give you freedom and culture,\nthe benefit of our knowledge....\"\n\n\"We didn't like your wrestlers,\" Forbes said.\n\nHeidel's nostrils twitched, and suddenly he swung the pistol. There was\na crashing explosion and then silence.\n\n\"Good,\" said Forbes. \"I don't think he got the last one fired.\"\n\n\"You're all right then?\" asked Meehan, putting his gun on the table.\n\n\"Oh, quite! Rather dramatic altogether, eh?\"\n\n\"Nerve tingling,\" Locke agreed.\n\nForbes turned in his chair and called, \"Oh, Kessit!\"\n\nThe butler opened the door to the darkened room, hesitated, and reached\nfor the light switch.\n\n\"No, no,\" Forbes said, smiling. \"Never mind that. Come over here, will\nyou please?\"\n\nThe butler crossed the room slowly.\n\n\"It's all right,\" Forbes said. \"The president will notice nothing\nwhatever, Kessit. Would you mind pouring us all another glass of wine?\nI'm frightfully crazy about that port, eh?\"\n\nThere was a murmur of agreeing voices. The butler lifted the silver\ndecanter and filled glasses, moving easily and surely in the darkness.\n\n\"Cheers,\" said Forbes.\n\n\"Cheers,\" said the others, over the clink of glasses.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n",
