Miss\nWilton is perfection.  Mr. Hare has genius, and his acting evinces\ncareful study.  The other performers are so excellent, each in his or her\nown way, that unless we mentioned all of them we dare not mention any;\nand, indeed, any notice now is somewhat after date, for has not all\nLondon seen the play, and all Pressdom said its say anent the same?",
