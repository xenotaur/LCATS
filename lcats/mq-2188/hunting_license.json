    "body": "The helicopters buzzed lazily overhead like fat flies in a warm May\nwind.\n\n\"There they go. Right on time,\" said William Karsten III. His hunting\njacket shone bright red in the early morning sun as he moved out into\nthe open to watch the planes.\n\n\"I do hope that they don't get airsick,\" replied Thomas Thurman from\nhis comfortable chair in front of the fire. He took a long stick and\nbegan poking the embers closer to the coffee container.\n\nWilliam Karsten turned around and looked at his companion. \"Why in\nheaven's name should you be so concerned about _them_?\" he asked. The\nearly morning light on his brown-and-gray hair gave it a more youthful\nappearance than it usually had.\n\n\"They don't hunt very well when they're sick,\" said Thurman. \"And\nthat of course, is my only concern for them.\" He smiled at his hunting\npartner, then motioned him over to the fire. \"Have a cup of coffee\nwhile we're waiting.\"\n\nKarsten walked over to the center of the little forest clearing where\nthey had built the fire. \"Might as well have a cup, I guess,\" he said.\nHis face, furrowed with deep lines that had taken half a life-time to\ncreate, wore a slight frown. \"But I wish that Emmett would get back.\nWhat's the sense of hiring a hunting guide if he's not around to take\ncare of things for you? I'm getting hungry.\"\n\nThurman laughed at him. \"If you'd worry more about where we're going\nto hunt instead of spending all your time thinking about your stomach,\nwe'd probably have better luck,\" he said. He poured a cup of sweet\nbrown coffee for both of them, then passed one of the cups to Karsten.\n\"Emmett probably couldn't get the Warden on the phone right away.\"\nThurman, who had once been something of an athlete, began to laugh, his\nheavy-set body shaking gently with the expressed mirth. \"If the worst\ncomes to the worst, Bill, we _could_ fix our own breakfast, you know.\"\n\nKarsten uttered a sigh. \"Hunting just isn't what it used to be.\nSometimes I wonder why I bother to come out at all.\" He settled down\ncomfortably on a collapsible chair and looked around him. He could just\nsee the top of a tall metal fence a few hundred yards away--the stout\ncircle of steel that engirdled the Game Preserve, cutting it off from\nthe rest of the world.\n\n\"You come hunting for the same reason that I do, Bill Karsten. Because\nyou love the thrill of the sport,\" Thurman told him. \"Because there's\nnothing like it in the world--the bright open air, the smell of a\ngreen forest, and the pleasure of pitting yourself against the hunted.\nThat's why you come hunting.\"\n\nKarsten shrugged. \"I suppose you're right, but--\" He stopped in\nmid-sentence, interrupted by the sound of trampled underbrush. \"Oh,\nhere's Emmett back.\"\n\n\n\nEmmett Packer, registered hunting guide, came from behind a clump of\nbushes into the little clearing in the woods. His bright yellow hunting\njacket reflected a dazzling pattern of sunlight and shadows in striking\ncontrast to the man's weathered complexion and dark black hair. He\nwaved a muscular arm at his employers.\n\n\"Sorry I took so long, boys,\" he said, walking towards them. \"But I had\ntrouble getting the Warden on the car telephone. The line was busy.\"\nEmmett poured himself a cup of coffee. \"But I finally got ahold of him,\nand he'll be along in a little while. And the horses are all lined up\nfor us at the Gate. So we shouldn't have any trouble at all.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Thurman.\n\nEmmett smiled, \"And now, I suppose you boys would like a little\nbreakfast?\" Emmett said it not quite as a question, but more as an\nassertion of a known fact.\n\n\"Of course, of course,\" said Karsten. \"I'm starving. Got to have energy\nto hunt, you know.\" He smiled jovially.\n\nEmmett set about opening canisters and boxes in preparation of the\nmeal. Thurman and Karsten leaned back in their comfortable chairs and\nstared at the scenery. Overhead one last helicopter droned by. In the\ntall forest grass a cricket chirped angrily.\n\n\"How would you like your steaks?\" asked Emmett.\n\n\"Medium,\" said Thurman.\n\n\"A little on the rare side, if you can manage it,\" said Karsten. \"And\nno onions for me. They give me indigestion.\" He glanced nervously at\nhis watch. \"I wonder if I'll have time to call the office before the\nWarden gets here?\"\n\nTom Thurman smiled. \"Relax,\" he said. \"Your office can take care of\nitself for a change.\"\n\n\"Well, I guess it can, but--\"\n\n\"Then why worry about it,\" said Thurman. \"Forget it. Make the most of\nyour vacation. After all, it isn't every day in the year that you come\nhunting humans, you know.\"\n\nShrugging his shoulders for an answer, William Karsten relaxed again.\nThe aroma of the cooking meat permeated the morning breeze, mingling\nwith the subtler smells of pine and warm rich earth. In the nearby\ntrees birds sang out loud.\n\n\"Wonder how many we'll get this year?\" asked Thurman after a while.\n\nEmmett looked up from his chores. \"If you boys will just follow my\ndirections, you'll get the limit.\" He smiled proudly. \"My hunters\n_always_ come back with the limit. You know that.\"\n\nKarsten harrumphed. \"I saw some of the sorry specimens you dug up for\nthe Kilpatricks last year. And I must say,\" he continued, \"they were\nthe poorest excuses for human beings I've ever seen.\"\n\nEmmett frowned and started to answer, but Thurman spoke first. \"That\nreminds me, Bill. If we bring back any bodies this year, Martha says\nwe'll have to wrap them up first.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with Martha?\" asked Karsten. \"She doesn't really\nobject to the sight of naked bodies lashed to the front fenders of your\ncar, does she?\"\n\nWith a laugh, Thomas Thurman said, \"No. Martha doesn't object to our\ndisplaying the spoils of the hunt. But she says that last year the\nblood spoiled the finish of the car. And I don't want to have it\nrepainted again this year.\" He sighed softly. \"Just one of her whims,\nI guess.\"\n\n\"Breakfast is ready,\" said Emmett.\n\n\n\nThe high-pitched whine of rotor blades interrupted their meal. The\nthree men watched the bright blue helicopter drop slowly out of the\nsky and come to a gentle landing at one edge of the clearing. Once the\nplane's engine had stopped and the blades were no longer twirling, the\ndoor to the air-craft opened and out stepped a rotund figure dressed\nin a uniform the same sky-blue color as that of the plane. He bounced,\nmore than walked, towards the seated trio.\n\n\"Good day! Good day, gentlemen!\" the Warden called out as soon as he\nwas within earshot. \"Oh, please don't get up on my account.\"\n\nThurman motioned with one hand. \"Have a seat, Warden. We're glad to see\nyou.\"\n\nThe Warden plopped his pudgy body down in one of the chairs. \"Thank\nyou,\" he said, his voice as round and as jolly as his appearance.\n\"Having breakfast, I see.\" He waved a hand \"Oh, please don't offer me\nanything to eat. I'm on a diet again.\" He sighed.\n\nEmmett rose to get the papers that the officer would want to see.\n\"How's the crop this year, Warden?\" he asked.\n\nA frown crossed the fat man's face. \"Fair. Just fair,\" he said. \"I\ncan't understand it, really. A few years ago there were so many of\nthem.\" His face brightened a bit. \"But, then, there's still enough to\ngo around, and that's the important thing. And, on the other hand, I\nsuppose that we ought to be happy--from the sociological point of view,\nof course--that there just aren't as many criminals in our society\ntoday as there used to be. It speaks well for us, don't you think?\"\n\nWilliam Karsten III made a slight noise with his tongue. \"But it ruins\nthe hunting. You can't have a hunt unless you've got criminals to hunt\nfor.\" He turned to his companion. \"You see, Tom,\" he said. \"I told you\nthat it wouldn't be too good this year.\"\n\n\"I wonder what's wrong with things nowadays that there just aren't\nenough criminals?\" mused Thurman.\n\nEmmett returned with the proper papers and handed them to the Warden.\nThe fat little man looked them over carefully, then handed them back\nto the guide with a wave of his hand. \"They look in excellent order,\"\nhe told Emmett. He turned to the hunters. \"You have a good man here in\nEmmett,\" he told them. Emmett favored the officer with a smile.\n\nReaching inside his jacket, the Warden extracted a little box and\nhanded it to Emmett. \"Here are the supersonic whistles, gentlemen, and\nthe crystals for your ear plugs so that you can hear them. Just be\nsure to use them. Remember the first time you sight a quarry, give one\nlong toot on the whistle. If you hear nothing in your ear plugs, he's\nyours to track down. But if you hear three short toots in answer, that\nmeans that someone else beat you to him.\" The officer wagged a finger\nat the two hunters. \"And let's have no mistakes and no arguments, like\nwe have had in the past. Just follow the rules--blow your whistles\ncorrectly--and everyone will have a fair chance at the game.\"\n\nEmmett fitted the slim crystals into the ear plugs. \"They look a little\ndifferent this year,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" the Warden told him. \"We had to go much higher up on the\nsupersonic scale this time since we discovered that one of the quarries\nlast year could hear up to 22,000 cycles.\" He smiled jovially. \"Can't\nhave the hunted hearing the whistles when they're being tracked down,\nyou know.\"\n\nKarsten wiped his lips with a napkin and then handed his empty plate to\nthe guide. \"Any new rules this year, Warden?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, I think the only new thing we have this year is that hunting\njacket of yours, Mr. Karsten. It _is_ new, isn't it?\"\n\nKarsten beamed. \"Why, yes it is. Latest style, I think.\" He raised his\narms to display the brilliant red garment the better. \"It's a new kind\nof material. Guaranteed to be seen for half a mile, even at night.\" He\nlowered his arms, then patted one of the chest pockets. \"But the best\nthing is that it's got a self-contained heating-cooling system built\nright in. All you have to do is to turn the dial and you get whatever\nweather you want.\"\n\n\n\nThe Warden looked impressed. \"My,\" he said. \"What won't they think of\nnext.\" He smiled again. \"I imagine that the people you're going to be\nhunting would give a pretty penny for one of those today. The weather\nman says it's going to be a bit chilly tonight.\"\n\nThurman lit a cigarette. \"I guess it is rather hard on them, being\ndumped in the middle of the Preserve completely naked, so to speak.\" He\nsighed. \"But then, they're criminals, after all.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said Karsten. \"And remember, they've got their paint to\nkeep them warm,\" he added, laughing.\n\nThe Warden snapped his fingers. \"I'm glad you reminded me, Mr.\nKarsten. The paint is a little different this year.\"\n\nKarsten looked surprised. \"They haven't changed the signals, have\nthey?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said the Warden. \"Black stripes painted all around the body\nstill mean he's an ordinary criminal, black and red alternating stripes\nmean crimes of passion, and all red stripes used for the subversives,\nof course. Just like always.\"\n\nCoughing discretely, the Warden continued. \"What I meant was that after\nthe complaints we got last year we decided to use a _really_ indelible\npaint so that not even a skilled surgeon could get it off.\"\n\n\"Complaints?\" asked Thurman.\n\nThe warden gave a gigantic sigh. \"That's right. It seems that some of\nthe hunters--not people like you, mind--but some of them have been\naltering the color of the stripes after they've bagged their game.\" He\nsmiled. \"And we can't have that, you know. It just isn't sporting. When\nyou display your trophies, you want all the glory that's coming to you.\n_But_ no more than you actually deserve.\"\n\nPutting his hands on the arms of the chair, the Warden made a valiant\neffort and managed, just barely, to remove his body from the comforting\nconfines of the chair. \"Well,\" he said, \"I must be off. Have a lot of\nother hunters to see before the season opens.\" The two hunters rose and\nshook hands with him.\n\n\"Now, let's synchronize our watches before I leave,\" the officer said.\nHe peered closely at his timepiece. \"It's now 7:23:05 by my official\nclock. I got word on my plane radio just as I was landing that the\ncriminals were dropped in the center of the Preserve at 7:03 exactly.\"\nHe looked up. \"The season opens at ten sharp. I'll see you at the Gate\nbefore then, of course.\" He turned around and bounced towards the\nplane. Before shutting the door to the air-craft, he gave them a final\nwave of his hand.\n\n\"Good hunting,\" he called.\n\n\n\nA little past ten the three men were riding their horses across the\ngentle plain that led to the mountains in the center of the Preserve.\nThey had passed through the gates with scores of other hunters the\nmoment the season was officially opened.\n\n\"Emmett,\" said Thurman, jogging along on his large horse. \"Are you\nstill going to insist on taking us down to that little pass first of\nall?\"\n\nEmmett reined his horse in between the mounts ridden by the two\nhunters. \"Well, I don't want to seem pig-headed about it, boys,\" he\ntold them. \"But that's where I think the hunting will be best this time\nof day.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" Karsten told him. \"I was talking to Morris Overman about\nit just last week. And he said he had his best luck over by that big\nwaterfall--you know the one, Emmett. It has lots of trees around it.\"\n\nEmmett raised his eyebrows, as if in disdain, \"Oh, I know the one, all\nright. And Mr. Overman is a pretty lucky hunter, too. But I think--\"\n\nThurman interrupted him. \"If you want _my_ opinion,\" he said, \"We'll do\nwell to try it down in that little valley just the other side of the\nLeaning Stone.\" He waved a magazine at them. \"There's an article on\nthe criminal mind in the latest issue of _Hunter's Scientific Monthly_\nby E. C. Stewart. He says that criminals always favor depressions, and\nthat ought to mean valleys too.\"\n\nFrowning, Emmett replied, \"Well, Stewart ought to know. He's a\npsychologist, after all. But I must remind you that my services are\nguaranteed only if you follow my directions. If you do like I tell\nyou, I promise that both of you boys will come back with at least one\ntrophy. Why, I even signed a contract to that effect with you.\"\n\n\"We know all that,\" Karsten told him.\n\n\"But if you insist on striking off on your own, the guarantee doesn't\nhold.\" Emmett paused a moment, as if for effect, then continued.\n\n\"Now, look, boys,\" he said. \"Doesn't it make sense, really, that since\nhunting is my job, I'd know where the big ones are? I don't mean to\nknock anyone else, but this _is_ my business, you know, and I've been\nat it for a good many years now. So you boys just stick with me, and\nyou won't come back empty-handed.\"\n\nThe two hunters made no reply, but Emmett could see that they weren't\nentirely satisfied. They rode along in silence for several moments.\nThen Emmett said to them in a confidential tone of voice, \"Frankly,\nboys, I didn't want to tell you this, because we guides like to keep\nour trade secrets to ourselves. But last year, the man I was guiding\nand I went to this little pass I'm taking you to, see, and we came up\nwith a whopper.\"\n\n\"Really?\" said Thurman, showing some interest.\n\n\"He must have weighed two hundred and fifty pounds--at least. One of\nthe biggest criminals I've ever seen. A magnificent creature,\" Emmett\ntold them.\n\n\"You don't say,\" said Karsten. \"Who got him?\"\n\nEmmett smiled. \"A Mr. Thompson, down from the northern part of the\ndistrict. The body was so big that Thompson had it skinned and tanned,\nand made a really nice-looking rug out of it. He sent me a picture to\nshow me.\"\n\nThurman's eyes were wide with delight. \"Amazing,\" he said.\n\n\"As for myself,\" commented Karsten. \"I don't hold with this rug\nbusiness. They're all right, I guess, for those who like them. But they\nget torn up so easily. Human beings just aren't thick skinned enough, I\nsuppose.\"\n\n\"Two hundred and fifty pounds,\" mused Thurman out loud.\n\n\"If he weighed, an ounce,\" Emmett said. \"You don't get many that size,\nyou know.\" He looked at the two hunters, then smiled securely. \"So\nshall we just follow my lead and head for the pass first thing?\"\n\n\"All right with me,\" Thurman said.\n\n\"Me, too,\" said Karsten. He belched loudly, then rubbed his stomach\ngently. \"I think I ate too much for breakfast,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe way to the little pass led up over the crest of one of the\nsmaller mountains. The three men jogged along at an even pace over\nthe level ground, but traveled more slowly up the steep facing of the\nmountainside. The two hunters often complained about the heat and the\nterrain as they rode. Emmett said little except when he urged them to\nhurry along.\n\nThe sun was high in the sky, just past the zenith, when the trio came\ndown the side of a small cliff and out through a little pass onto an\nopen space of ground.\n\nEmmett pulled up his horse and dismounted. \"Well, boys,\" he said.\n\"Let's get off here for a while.\" The other two dismounted and handed\ntheir animals over to the guide.\n\n\"Looks like a fairly good spot,\" said Thurman. Emmett tethered the\nhorses quickly and then began unpacking some of the equipment. He put\nup the collapsible chairs in the cooling shade of a single tree that\nstood near the center of the little clearing. Then he placed some of\nthe boxes containing food around the chairs and handed the two hunters\ntheir guns.\n\n\"If you boys will make yourselves comfortable, I'll go out and scout\naround for something to shoot at,\" he told them.\n\nKarsten settled down into one of the chairs with an audible sigh of\nrelief. Thurman gave his gun a casual inspection. \"All right,\" he said\nto the guide. \"Go ahead. And see if you can find something worth while.\"\n\nEmmett tucked his rifle under his arm and headed off into the dense\nunderbrush.\n\n\"Have something to eat,\" Karsten said, passing an open box to his\ncompanion.\n\nThurman helped himself to the food, then leaned back in his chair. \"I\ndon't mind saying that I hope Emmett will come up with a good-sized one\nright off,\" he said.\n\n\"You know what I'd like?\" Karsten said through a mouthful of food. \"I\nwish he'd find me a real red-head. That's all I really need to give my\ncollection balance.\" He waved a chicken leg at Thurman. \"If it were a\ngood-sized head, I'd hang it right in the center over the mantelpiece.\nI could surround it with heads that have dark hair and make quite an\nattractive pattern. My wife goes in for color schemes, you know.\"\n\nTom Thurman sighed. The day was dry and he could feel the drowsy heat\nof the sun even in the pleasant shade of the large tree. He began to\nfan himself with his hand. \"I understand the latest fad is to have\nthe whole body stuffed and mounted on a plaque before you hang it up\non the wall,\" he said. He shrugged his shoulders. \"Maybe I'm just old\nfashioned,\" he continued, \"but it seems to me that they would take up\nan awful lot of room if you did that.\"\n\nA tiny gnat began to pester Karsten as he ate. He brushed it aside\nseveral times, but it always returned to whine annoyingly around his\nface. \"Well,\" Karsten said, \"there's precedent for it. Remember how\nexcited old Morrie was the first time he bagged a two hundred pounder?\"\nKarsten guffawed. \"He was so damn proud he kept the whole body and\ntucked it away in his freezer. Used to pull it out to show to people\nwhen he gave a party.\" Sighing in reminiscence, he continued. \"Had to\ngive it up after a while, though. He thawed it out so many times that\nit began to spoil.\" He slapped violently at the gnat.\n\nThurman opened his canteen and began sipping at the cool liquid inside.\nHe was about to light a cigarette when he saw Emmett returning.\n\n\"Here comes Emmett,\" he said excitedly to Karsten. \"Maybe he's made\ncontact!\"\n\nKarsten got up from his chair heavily, \"He's smiling; I'll bet he found\nus a good one!\" He reached for his gun.\n\nEmmett walked up to the two hunters quickly. \"Well, boys, you're in,\"\nhe said, grinning broadly. \"I found one, just like I told you I would.\"\n\n\"Where?\" asked Thurman quickly.\n\n\"Down this little path here, about a quarter of a mile. He's hiding\nin a kind of thicket, but you won't have any trouble spotting him. The\nsun's bright there, and you can see the white of his body clearly.\" He\npaused to give them a superior grin. \"And I don't think he knew that\nI'd spotted him.\"\n\n\"You stay here and look after the horses,\" Thurman told the guide.\n\"We'll signal you at the kill.\"\n\n\n\nThe two hunters walked quickly down the path under the refreshing shade\nof the forest. Both of them were excited and they tended occasionally\nto stumble over tree roots and dead branches as they went.\n\n\"He must be just down the way there,\" Karsten whispered hoarsely after\nthey had gone for some distance into the woods.\n\n\"Shush,\" whispered Thurman, attempting to quiet his companion.\n\nThe path made a slight turn just beyond them, and when they had rounded\nit, they saw a thick clump of bushes ahead. Through the green-and-brown\npattern of the leaves they could see brief patches of pale white.\n\n\"That's it,\" whispered Karsten. Thurman nodded and pulled out his\nwhistle. He gave a long, silent blast on it that he could hear only as\na sharp rasping noise from the tiny plug he wore in one ear.\n\nThe two hunters stood quietly, waiting, their faces filled with\nexpectation. After a few brief moments, Thurman turned to his hunting\npartner. \"No answer. We must have spotted him first.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Karsten. \"Let's go get him.\"\n\nThey had no more than started towards their quarry when they saw a\nsudden movement in the bushes. The white patches disappeared, and they\ncould hear the sound of running feet.\n\n\"Damn!\" said Karsten loudly. \"He must have heard us.\"\n\nThurman smiled. \"It's better this way, Bill. I rather like tracking\nthem down. Don't you?\"\n\n\"Well, its kind of a bother, as far as I'm concerned. Especially so\nsoon after eating,\" Karsten said. But he followed quickly behind as\nThurman set off in pursuit.\n\nThe forest was too thick for a man to run with any real speed, so the\nhunters managed to stay close behind their quarry without expending too\nmuch energy.\n\n\"I wonder what he looked like,\" Karsten said they pushed their way\nthrough the thick underbrush. \"I didn't get a good look at him.\"\n\n\"Neither did I,\" Thurman replied, grabbing hold of a vine to pull\nhimself over a dead tree that stood in their path. \"I hope he isn't\njust an ordinary criminal. I've got enough black stripes at home as it\nis.\"\n\n\"Look out!\" Karsten cried suddenly. \"He's doubling back on us!\"\n\nThe two men turned rapidly and set off in a new direction, attempting\nto head off their quarry before he could make his way to open ground.\nThey managed to get in between him and the edge of the woods and were\nrewarded by seeing a brief ripple of white as the naked man turned and\nstarted back towards the center of the little forest.\n\n\"Good work,\" said Thurman.\n\nMost of the time they tracked him simply by listening to the directions\nthe noise of his running came from. Often they were close enough at his\nheels to get a quick glimpse of flesh in the distance--an arm, a leg,\nor part of his back. They got their first good look at him when they\ncame out from behind a rock into a little clearing. The quarry was just\ndisappearing into the forest on the other side of the open space.\n\n\"Red stripes!\" cried Karsten as they rushed across the clearing. \"He's\na subversive. Now, that is luck.\"\n\n\"Looks awfully small to me,\" said Thurman, \"whatever he is.\"\n\n\"Damn. You don't suppose it could be a woman, do you?\" Karsten asked\nsomewhat breathlessly. \"We only got a glimpse of it.\"\n\n\"I hope not. Supposed to be bad luck to shoot a woman first thing on a\nhunt, you know,\" Thurman replied as they reached the far side of the\nclearing. \"Anyway, we'll soon know.\"\n\nThey plunged into the heavy forest only a few hundred yards behind\ntheir game. Following rapidly along behind him, they left a wake of\nbroken branches and torn limbs as they went. The forest rang with the\nsounds of the chase.\n\nSoon, sloshing across a little stream, they came up over a grassy knoll\nand down into a shallow glade on the other side of it.\n\n\"He's heading for the rocks, over that way,\" Thurman said, turning off\nin pursuit. \"He won't be able to go much farther.\"\n\n\"I don't know if _I'll_ be able to go much farther,\" said Karsten, the\nperspiration beading out across his heavy face. \"I'm not used to this.\"\n\n\"Neither is he,\" Thurman reminded him. \"Remember, he's had nothing to\neat for almost a week, and they probably didn't let him sleep for three\nor four days back. He can't last much longer.\"\n\n\"I hope not,\" said Karsten.\n\nThey passed across a narrow strip of marsh land, carefully avoiding\nmost of the bog holes as they went. Just on the other side, as they\ncame around a series of heavy berry bushes, they heard a long, shrill\nbuzz from their ear plugs.\n\nThurman stopped quickly. \"Somebody else has spotted him!\" he said, and\ntook out his whistle. He gave it three lusty blasts and then stuck it\nback in his pocket. \"That should fix them,\" he told his partner. They\nset off again in pursuit.\n\nSoon it became obvious to the two hunters that they were gaining\nrapidly on their quarry. They increased their pace just a trifle to\ntake advantage of their lead.\n\n\n\nIt was perhaps five minutes later when they tracked their man down and\nfor the first time got a good look at him. They were very close to the\noutcroppings of a rather steep foothill when they came over a little\nrise and saw him scarcely a thousand yards in front of them.\n\n\"There he goes!\" cried Karsten. \"Into that little pass between those\ntwo rocks!\" Rapidly they closed in upon the narrow pass.\n\nThe opening between the big rocks was not much more than ten feet wide.\nIt led like a narrow corridor through the sides of the hill and then\nopened up beyond into a little canyon. The two hunters paused just on\nthe other side of the pass.\n\n\"I think he's trapped,\" said Thurman. \"I can't tell for sure, because\nthere are too many bushes in the way. But I think this is a little box\ncanyon, and that this pass is the only way out.\"\n\nWilliam Karsten looked around him. \"Seems that way to me,\" he told his\ncompanion. \"Let's move on in slowly.\"\n\nThey took their time as they walked through the narrow canyon, checking\nbehind each bush and rock as they went. The little valley was only a\nhundred yards wide but several hundred yards in length. On all sides\nrose a sheer cliff some fifty feet in height.\n\nWhen they were about two hundred yards from the end of the canyon, they\nstopped. The cliff walls had narrowed so that there was scarcely a\ntwenty-five yard distance from one side to the other. Only one last row\nof bushes separated the hunters from their quarry.\n\n\"I can see him from here,\" Karsten said. \"He's up against the back of\nthe canyon there, trying to hide.\"\n\n\"Well, this is it,\" Thurman said. \"It's a pity he's such a small-sized\none.\"\n\n\"Well,\" asked Karsten. \"Shall we flip a coin?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said Thurman. He reached in his pocket. \"Call it,\" he said.\n\n\"Heads,\" Karsten answered. Thomas Thurman tossed the coin high into the\nair. Its silver sides caught brightly at the sunlight as it mounted in\na smooth arc, then danced back to earth. The two men leaned over to\ninspect it.\n\n\"Heads it is,\" Karsten said, grinning. \"I win.\"\n\n\"This is your day, I guess,\" Thurman told him.\n\nKarsten moved forward to the clump of bushes, Thurman following close\nbehind. They could see the quarry clearly now, the whiteness of his\nbody in bold contrast with the thick red stripes.\n\n\"He has gray hair,\" Thurman said.\n\nThe criminal inched back along the rocky wall, seeking desperately for\nsome exit. He tried to climb up the side of the cliff, but could do\nno more than to stir up a small shower of loose stones as he lost his\nfooting. Suddenly he picked up a rock, twirled, and threw it at the\nhunters. It scarcely covered a third of the ground between them.\n\n\"Well, I like that,\" said Karsten. \"He's got his nerve.\" He raised\nhis rifle to his shoulder and looked carefully through the telescopic\nsight. For several moments he held his stance. Then slowly he lowered\nthe gun back to his side.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Tom,\" he said. \"But I think I'll let you have this one\nafter all.\"\n\nThurman looked surprised. \"What's the matter, Bill?\" he asked.\n\nWilliam Karsten sighed. \"I think I used to know him.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Thurman said. And then he frowned. \"You're sure it's not just\nbecause he's so small that you're giving him up?\" he questioned.\n\n\"No. Quite sure. I think he was one of my professors back in college.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, then,\" Thurman said. He put his gun to his shoulder and took\ncareful aim.\n\n\"Shoot for the body, Tom,\" Karsten whispered to him. \"Don't want to\nspoil the head.\"\n\nThurman pulled the trigger. The explosion split the quiet air apart and\ncast the pieces of silence as echoes up and down the little canyon.\n\n\n\n\"Good shot!\" Karsten told his companion. \"Nice and clean.\"\n\nThurman smiled. \"Thank you,\" he said. And then, \"Too bad you had to\ngive him up.\"\n\nShrugging his shoulders, Karsten said, \"Well, that's the way of things.\nI don't remember him too well, but I think he taught me anthropology.\nOld Mac something-or-other. I forget his name.\"\n\nThe two men started walking back towards the entrance to the canyon.\n\"I suppose that I could have taken him anyway,\" Karsten said as they\nwalked. \"But I've never considered it good taste to shoot someone whom\nI've known.\"\n\n\"I know how you feel,\" Thurman told him.\n\n\"It sort of ... well ... ruins the sport, if you know what I mean,\"\nKarsten said.\n\n\"Sure,\" replied Thurman.\n\nThey went quietly through the narrow little pass, stopping on the other\nside. Thurman lit a cigarette and leaned back against a rock to rest.\nKarsten put a star shell into his rifle, pointed it towards the sky,\nand fired. They both watched as it burst into a gaudy blossom of fire\nand smoke far above them.\n\n\"That ought to bring Emmett on the run,\" Karsten said. \"He can clean\nthings up and leave a marker. The plane will pick up the body later\ntoday.\"\n\nThurman took a deep breath. The air had a tangy smell to it of\nspringtime grass and early flowers. The warmth of the sun gave the\nforest a hazy sort of glow. In the nearby trees small animals chattered\nloudly.\n\n\"Nice day, isn't it, Bill?\"\n\n\"It certainly is,\" Karsten answered, gazing thoughtfully at the\npleasant landscape. \"But look at those clouds. It might rain tonight.\"\n\n\"It might at that,\" Thurman told him. He gave another sigh and then\nsmiled, dropping his cigar to the ground and crushing it out beneath\nhis boot.\n\n\"Well, shall we go?\" he asked. \"I'm getting hungry.\"",
