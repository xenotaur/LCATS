They want to sing in nightclubs and hook\nup with some millionaire and wear beautiful clothes. Housework is\nsomething for gadgets to take care of, with maids to run the gadgets.\nAfraid to get a few calluses on their dainty hands!_\n\n\"_We got a way to handle that on Deneb. A girl gets highfalutin up\nthere, the Doc puts her in the Ego Alter room. Thicken up her ankles a\nlittle, take some of the sparkle out of her eyes and hair, and you get a\nwoman fit to pull a plow!_\"\n\n_Hold it, Madam! H. L. Gold said that; not us. Personally, we like\ngirls--not Percherons!_]\n\n\nIf there was one thing Dr. Kalmar hated, and there were many, it was\nhaving a new assistant fresh from a medical school on Earth. They always\nwanted to change things. They never realized that a planet develops its\nown techniques to meet its own requirements, which are seldom similar to\nthose of any other world. Dr. Kalmar never got along with his assistants\nand he didn't expect to get along with this young Dr. Hoyt who was\ncoming in on the transfer ship from Vega.\n\nDr. Kalmar had been trained on Earth himself, of course, but he\nwistfully remembered how he had revered Dr. Lowell when he had been\nLowell's assistant. He'd known that his own green learning was no match\nfor Dr. Lowell's wisdom and experience after 30 years on Deneb, and he\nhad avidly accepted his lessons.\n\nWhy, he grumbled to himself on his way to the spaceport to meet the\nunknown whippersnapper, why didn't Earth turn out young doctors the way\nit used to? They ought to have the arrogance knocked out of them before\nthey left medical school. That's what must have happened to him, because\nhis attitude had certainly been humble when he landed.\n\nThe spaceport was jammed, naturally. Ship arrivals were infrequent\nenough to bring everybody from all over the planet who was not on duty\nat the farms, mines, factories, freight and passenger jets and all the\nrest of the busy activities of this comparatively new colony. They\nbrought their lunches and families and stood around to watch. Dr. Kalmar\nwent to the platform.\n\nThe ship sat down on a mushroom of fire that swiftly became a flaming\npancake and then was squashed out of existence.\n\n\"I'm waiting for a shipment of livestock,\" enthused the man standing\nnext to Dr. Kalmar.\n\n\"You're lucky,\" the doctor said. \"They can't talk back.\"\n\nThe man looked at him sympathetically. \"Meeting a female?\"\n\n\"Gabbier and more annoying,\" said Dr. Kalmar, but he didn't elaborate\nand the man, with the courtesy of the frontier, did not pry for an\nexplanation.\n\nLivestock and freight came down on one elevator and passengers came down\nanother. Slidewalks carried the cargo to Sterilization and travelers to\nthe greeting platform. Dr. Kalmar felt his shoulders droop. The man with\nthe medical bag had to be Dr. Hoyt and he was even more brisk, erect and\nmuscular than Dr. Kalmar had expected, with a superior and inquisitive\nlook that made the last assistant, unbearable as he'd been, seem as\ntractable as one of the arriving cows.\n\nDr. Hoyt spotted him instantly and came striding over to grab his hand\nin a grip like an ore-crusher. \"You're Dr. Kalmar. Glad to know you. I'm\nsure we'll get along fine together. Miserable trip. Had to change ships\nfour times to get here. Hope the food's better than shipboard slop. Got\na nice hospital to work in? Do I live in or out?\"\n\nDr. Kalmar was grudgingly forced to say rapidly, \"Right. Likewise. I\nhope so. Too bad. Suits us. I think so. In.\"\n\nHe got Dr. Hoyt into a jetcab and told the driver to make time back to\nthe hospital. Appointments were piling up while he had to make the\ncourtesy trip out to the spaceport, which was another nuisance. Now he'd\nhave all of those and a talkative assistant who'd want to know the\nreasons for everything.\n\n\"Pretty barren,\" said Dr. Hoyt, looking out the window at the\nvegetationless ground below. \"Why's that?\"\n\nHe'd known he was going to Deneb, Dr. Kalmar thought angrily. The least\nhe could have done was read up on the place. _He_ had.\n\n\"It's an Earth-type planet,\" Dr. Kalmar said in a blunt voice, \"except\nthat life never developed on it. We had to bring everything--benign germ\ncultures, seed, animals, fish, insects--a whole ecology. Our farms are\nclose to the cities. Too wasteful of freight to move them out very far.\nAnother few centuries and we'll have a _real_ population, millions of\npeople instead of the 20,000 we have now in a couple of dozen\nsettlements around this world. Then we'll have the whole place a nice\nshade of green.\"\n\n\"City boy myself,\" said Dr. Hoyt. \"Hate the country. Hydroponics and\nsynthetic meat--that's the answer.\"\n\n\"For Earth. It'll be a long time before we get that crowded here on\nDeneb.\"\n\n\"Deneb,\" the young doctor repeated, dissatisfied. \"That's the name of\nthe star. You mean to tell me the planet has the same name?\"\n\n\"Most solar systems have only one Earth-type planet. It saves a lot of\ntrouble to just call that planet Deneb, Vega or whatever.\"\n\n\"Is _that_ clutch of shacks the _city_?\" exclaimed Dr. Hoyt.\n\n\"Denebia,\" said Dr. Kalmar, beginning to enjoy himself finally.\n\n\"Why, you could lose it in a suburb or Bosyorkdelphia!\"\n\n\"That monstrosity that used to be New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut,\nRhode Island and Massachusetts? I wouldn't want to.\"\n\nHe was pleased when Dr. Hoyt sank into stunned silence. If luck was with\nhim, that stupefaction might last the whole day. It seemed as though it\nmight, for the sight of the modest little hospital was too much for the\nyoungster who had just come from the mammoth health factories of Earth.\n\nDr. Hoyt revived somewhat when he saw the patients waiting in the\nscantily furnished outer room, but Dr. Kalmar said, \"Better get yourself\nsettled,\" and opened a door for his immature colleague.\n\n\"But there's only one bed in this room,\" Dr. Hoyt objected. \"You must\nhave made a mistake.\"\n\nDr. Kalmar, recalling the crowded cubicles of Earth, gave out a proud\nlittle dry laugh. \"You're on Deneb now, boy. Here you'll have to get\nused to spaciousness. We like elbow room.\"\n\nThe young doctor went in hesitantly, leaving the door open for a fast\nescape in case an error had been made. Dr. Kalmar had done the same when\nhe'd arrived nine years ago. Judging by his own experience, it would\ntake Dr. Hoyt a full six months to get used to having a room all to\nhimself. There would be plenty of time to start showing him the ropes\ntomorrow, and in the meantime there were the backed-up appointments to\nbe taken care of.\n\nDr. Kalmar went to his office and had his nurse, Miss Dupont, send in\nthe first patient.\n\nIt was a girl of 17, Avis Emery, who had been brought by her parents.\nShe sat sullenly, dark-haired, too daintily pretty and delicately\nshapely for a frontier world like this, while Mr. Emery put the file\nfrom Social Control on the doctor's desk.\n\n\"We're farmers--\" the man began.\n\nDr. Kalmar interrupted, \"The information is in the summary. Avis is to\nbe assigned her mate next year, but she wants to go to Earth and become\na nightclub singer. She refuses to marry a boy who'd be able to help\naround the farm, and she won't work on it herself.\"\n\nHe looked up severely at the parents. \"This is your own fault, you know.\nYou pampered her. Farm labor is too valuable for pampering. We can't\nafford it.\"\n\n\"You can blame me, Doc,\" said Mr. Emery miserably. \"She's such a pretty\nlittle thing--I couldn't work her the way Sue and I work ourselves.\"\n\n\"And then she started getting notions,\" Mrs. Emery added, giving her\nhusband a vicious glare. Dr. Kalmar could imagine the nights of argument\nand accusation before they were at last forced to go for medical help to\nsolve their self-created problem. \"Singing in nightclubs back on Earth,\nmarrying a billionaire, living in a sky yacht!\"\n\n\"Avis,\" said Dr. Kalmar gently. \"You know it's not that easy, don't you?\nThere are lots and lots of pretty girls on Earth and very few\nbillionaires. If you did get a job singing in a nightclub, you know\nyou'd have to do some unpleasant things because there's so much\ncompetition for customers. Things like stripteasing, drinking at the\ntables and going out with whoever the owner tells you to.\"\n\nThe girl's face grew animated for the first time. \"Well, sure! Why do\nyou think I want to go?\"\n\n\"And you don't love Deneb and your farm?\"\n\n\"I hate both of them!\"\n\n\"But you realize that we must have food. Doesn't it make you feel\nimportant to grow more food so we can increase our population?\"\n\n\"No! Why should I care? I want to go to Earth!\"\n\nDr. Kalmar shook his head regretfully. He pushed a button on his desk.\nIt was connected to a gravity generator directly under the girl's chair.\nFour gravities suddenly pushed her down into it and a hypodermic needle\njabbed her swiftly with a hypnotic drug. She slumped. He released the\nbutton and the artificial gravity abated, but she remained dazed and\nrelaxed.\n\n\"You're not going to hurt her, are you, Doc?\" Mr. Emery begged.\n\n\"Certainly not. But I suppose you know Social Control's orders.\"\n\nThey nodded, the husband gloomily, the wife with a single sharp jerk of\nher head.\n\n\"You go right ahead and do it,\" she said. \"I'm sick of working my\nfingers to the bone while she primps and preens and talks all the time\nabout going to Earth.\"\n\n\"Come, Avis,\" Dr. Kalmar said in a low, commanding voice.\n\nShe stood up, blank-faced, and followed him out to the Ego Alter room.\nHe closed the door, sat her down in the insulated seat next to the\ncontrol console, put the wired plastic helmet on her and adjusted it to\nfit her skull snugly.\n\nRunning his finger down the treatment sheet of her Social Control file,\nhe set the dials according to its instructions. The psychic areas to be\nreduced were sex drive, competitiveness and imagination, while the areas\nof reproductive urge and cooperation were to be intensified. He\nregulated the individual timers and sent the varying charge through her\nbrain.\n\nThere was no reaction, no convulsion, no distortion of features. She sat\nthere as if nothing had happened, but her personality had changed as\ncompletely as though she had been retrained from birth.\n\nMiss Dupont came in without knocking. She knew, of course, that any\npatient in the Ego Alter room would be incapable of being disturbed.\n\n\"Rephysical, Dr. Kalmar?\" she asked.\n\n\"I'm afraid so. Will you prepare her, please?\"\n\nThe nurse removed the girl's clothes. There was no resistance.\n\n\"Such a lovely body,\" she said. \"It's a shame.\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"Until we have enough people and farms and industries, Miss\nDupont, we'll just have to get used to altering people to fit the needs\nof our society. I'm sure you understand that.\"\n\n\"Yes, but it still seems a shame. Bodies like that don't grow on trees.\"\n\nHe gently moved the girl into the Rephysical Chamber. \"They grow in this\nmachine, though. As soon as we can afford it, which ought to be only a\nfew hundred years from now, we can make any woman look like this, or\neven better.\"\n\n\"And don't forget the men,\" Miss Dupont said as he started the\nmitogenetic generator. \"We could use some Adonises around here.\"\n\n\"We'll have them,\" he assured her.\n\n\"Somebody will. None of us'll live that long.\"\n\nWorking like a sculptor with a cathode in one hand and an anode in the\nother, Dr. Kalmar began reshaping the girl who stood fixedly in the\nboxlike chamber. The flesh fled from the cathode and chased after the\nanode as he broadened the fine nose, thickened the mobile lips, squared\nthe slender jaw and drew out carefully the delicately arched orbital\nridges.\n\n\"I'll leave the curl in her hair,\" he said. \"Every woman needs at least\none feature she can be proud of.\"\n\n\"You're telling me,\" Miss Dupont replied.\n\n\"Synthetic tissue, please.\"\n\nShe drew out a tube with a variable nozzle and started working just\nahead of him. A spray of high-velocity cells shot through the girl's\nsmooth skin at the neck, shoulders, breasts, hips and legs, forming\nshapeless lumps that he guided into cords and muscles. The slim figure\nquickly broadened, grew brawny and competent-looking, the body of a\nwoman who could breed phenomenally while farming alongside her man.\n\nDr. Kalmar racked up the instruments and helped Miss Dupont dress the\ngirl in coveralls and sandals. He felt the pride of craftsmanship when\nhe found that the clothing supplied for her by Social Control exactly\nfitted her. He injected an antidote to the hypnotic and gave her the\nstandard test for emotional response as her expressionless face cleared\nto placidity.\n\n\"Do you know where you are, Avis?\"\n\n\"Yes. Ego Alter and Rephysical.\"\n\n\"What have we done to you?\"\n\n\"Changed me to fit my environment.\"\n\n\"Do you resent being changed?\"\n\n\"No.\" She paused and looked worried. \"Who's taking care of the crops\nwhile I'm here?\"\n\n\"They can wait till you and your parents get back, Avis. Let's show them\nthe change, shall we?\"\n\n\"All right,\" she said. \"I think they'll be proud of me. This is how they\nalways wanted me to be.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"Oh, I feel much better. As if I don't have to try so hard.\"\n\n\"I'm glad, Avis. Miss Dupont, better have a sedative ready when her\nfather sees her. I think he'll need it.\"\n\n\"And her mother?\" asked the nurse practically.\n\n\"She'll probably want a drink to celebrate. Give her one.\"\n\n\n\nDr. Kalmar's prognosis was correct, only it didn't go far enough. His\nyoung assistant from Earth had come scooting out of his disquietingly\nlarge quarters and was jittering in the office when they entered.\n\n\"Is _that_ the pretty girl who was waiting when we came in?\" he yelped\nin outrage. \"What have you done to her?\"\n\nDr. Kalmar gave the sedative to him instead of Mr. Emery, who was\nshocked, but had known in advance what to expect. Miss Dupont prepared\nanother sedative quickly, gave Mrs. Emery a celebration drink and moved\nthe family toward the door.\n\n\"She looks fine, Doctor,\" the mother said happily. \"Avis ought to be a\nbig help around the house and farm from now on.\"\n\n\"I'm sure she will,\" he said.\n\n\"But she was so lovely!\" wept Mr. Emery, though in a rapidly becalming\nvoice as the sedative took effect.\n\nThe door closed behind them.\n\n\"You ought to be reported to the Medical Association back on Earth!\" Dr.\nHoyt said angrily. \"Ruining a girl's looks like that!\"\n\nDr. Kalmar sighed. He had hoped to be able to put off this orientation\nlecture until the following day, when there wouldn't be so many patients\njamming his appointment book.\n\n\"All right, let's get it over with. First, I was also trained on Earth\nand know how Ego Alter and Rephysical are used there: Ego Alter to\nremove psychic blocks so people can compete better, and Rephysical so\nthey'll be more attractive. Second, we're not under the jurisdiction of\nEarth's Medical Association. Third, we'd damn well better not be,\nbecause our problems and solutions aren't the same at all.\"\n\n\"You'd have been jailed for spoiling that girl's chances of a good\nmarriage!\"\n\n\"I didn't,\" Dr. Kalmar said quietly. \"I improved them.\"\n\n\"You did nothing of the--\" Dr. Hoyt stopped. \"Improved? How?\"\n\n\"I keep telling you this is a frontier world and you keep acting as if\nyou understand, but you don't. Look, a family is an economic liability\non Earth; it consumes without producing. That's why girls have so much\ntrouble finding husbands there. Out here it's different. A family is an\nasset--if every member in it is willing to work.\"\n\n\"But a pretty girl like that can always get by.\"\n\n\"No Denebian can afford to marry a pretty girl. It's too risky. She\ncan't work as hard as we do and still take care of her looks. And he'd\nworry about her constantly, which would cut into his efficiency. By\nhaving me make her a merely attractive girl in a wholesome, hearty way,\nSocial Control guarantees more than just a marriage for her--it\nguarantees a contented married life.\"\n\n\"Sweating away on a farm,\" Dr. Hoyt said.\n\n\"Now that her anti-social strivings are gone, she'll realize that Deneb\nneeds farmers instead of nightclub singers. She'll take pride in being a\ngood worker, she'll raise as many children as she'll be capable of\nbearing, and she'll have a good husband and a prosperous farm. That\nwouldn't have satisfied her before. It will now. And she's better for it\nand so is Deneb.\"\n\nDr. Hoyt shook his head. \"It's all upside down.\"\n\n\"You'll get used to it. Why not take today off and explore Denebia? You\nneed a rest after all those months in space.\"\n\n\"Maybe I will,\" said Dr. Hoyt vaguely, slightly anesthetized.\n\n\"Good.\" Dr. Kalmar buzzed for Miss Dupont. \"Send in the next patient,\nplease. Oh, and Dr. Hoyt is taking the day off.\"\n\n\n\nBut the young assistant was stunned into staying by the huge size of the\nSocial Control file that was carried by the next patient, Mr. Fallon,\nand his wife.\n\n\"I know just what you're thinking, Dr. Kalmar!\" cried Mrs. Fallon\ndistractedly, but with a nervously bright smile. \"Those awful Fallons\nagain! I don't blame you a bit, but--\"\n\nAs a matter of fact, that was exactly what Dr. Kalmar was thinking, plus\nthe defeated feeling that they were all he needed to make the day\ncomplete.\n\n\"Good Lord, what's in all those files?\" Dr. Hoyt exclaimed.\n\nDr. Kalmar could have explained, but he didn't feel up to it.\n\nMr. Fallon, a wispy, shyly affable, poetic-looking chap, did it for him.\n\"Papers,\" he said.\n\n\"I know that, but why so many?\" Dr. Hoyt asked impatiently.\n\nMiss Dupont seemed wryly amused as she watched his consternation.\n\n\"I guess you might say it's because I can't make my mind up,\" confessed\nMrs. Fallon with an uneasy giggle. She was a big woman who might have\ngurgled over a collection of toy dogs on Earth, but here she was a\nfreight checker and her husband was a statistician in the Department of\nSupply, though on Earth he might have been anything from a composer to a\nsocial worker. \"No matter how often we rephysical Harry, I always get\ntired of his looks in a few months.\"\n\n\"And how often has that been done?\" Dr. Hoyt demanded.\n\n\"I think it's eleven times. Isn't that right, dear?\"\n\n\"No, sweet,\" said Mr. Fallon. \"Thirteen.\"\n\nDr. Kalmar could have interrupted, but he considered it wiser to let his\nassistant learn the hard way. Miss Dupont was enjoying it too much to\ninterfere.\n\n\"We've made him tall and we've made him short, skinny, fat, bulging with\nmuscle, red hair, black hair, blond hair, gray hair--I don't know, just\nabout everything in the book,\" said Mrs. Fallon, \"and I simply can't\nseem to find one I'd like for keeps.\"\n\n\"Then why the devil don't you get another husband?\"\n\nMrs. Fallon looked shocked. \"Why, he was assigned to me!\"\n\n\"Dr. Hoyt just came from Earth,\" Dr. Kalmar cut in at last, before a\nbrawl could start. \"He's not familiar with our methods.\"\n\n\"Let's hear the cockeyed reason,\" Dr. Hoyt said resignedly.\n\n\"We keep our population balanced,\" said Dr. Kalmar. \"Too many of either\nsex creates tension, hostility, loss of efficiency; look at Earth if you\nwant proof. We can't risk even a little of that, so we use prenatal sex\ncontrol to keep them exactly equal.\"\n\n\"There's a wife for every man,\" Mr. Fallon put in genially, \"and a\nhusband for every woman. Works out fine.\"\n\n\"With no surplus,\" Dr. Kalmar added. \"There are no floaters to allow the\nkind of marital moving day you have on Earth, where so many just up and\nshift over to new mates. We get ours for life. That's where Ego Alter\nand Rephysical come in.\"\n\n\"You mean people bring in their mates to have them done over?\"\n\n\"If they're not satisfied and if the mates agree to be changed.\"\n\n\"I don't mind,\" said Mr. Fallon virtuously. \"I figure Mabel will decide\nwhat she wants one of these changes, and then we can settle down and be\nhappy with each other.\"\n\n\"But what about you?\" asked Dr. Hoyt, bewildered. \"Don't you want her\nchanged?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. I like her fine just as she is.\"\n\n\"You see now how it works?\" Dr. Kalmar asked. \"We can't have a variety\nof mates, but we can have all the variety we want in one mate. It comes\nto the same thing, as far as I can see, and causes much less confusion,\nespecially since we need stable relationships.\"\n\nDr. Hoyt was striving heroically to stay indignant in spite of the\nsedative. \"And do many ask to have their mates changed?\"\n\n\"I guess we're a sort of record, aren't we?\" Mr. Fallon boasted.\n\n\"I guess you are,\" agreed Dr. Kalmar. \"And now, Dr. Hoyt, if there\naren't any more questions, I'd like to proceed with this couple.\"\n\nDr. Hoyt stretched his eyes wide to keep them open. \"It's all screwy to\nme, but it's none of my business. As soon as I finish my internship, I'm\nheading back to Earth, where things make sense, so I don't have to\nunderstand this mishmash you call a planet. Need help?\"\n\n\"If you'd find out what Mrs. Fallon has in mind this time, it would let\nme run the patients through a lot faster.\"\n\n\"How would they feel about it?\" Dr. Hoyt asked.\n\n\"It's all right with me,\" Mr. Fallon said amiably. \"I'm pretty used to\nthis, you know.\"\n\n\"But what are we going to make you look like, Harry?\" his wife fretted.\n\"I felt very jealous of other women when you were handsome and I didn't\nlike you just ordinary-looking.\"\n\n\"Why not go through the model book with Dr. Hoyt?\" suggested Dr. Kalmar.\n\"There are still some types you haven't tried.\"\n\n\"There _are_?\" she asked in gratified astonishment. \"Would you mind very\nmuch, Dr. Hoyt?\"\n\n\"Glad to,\" he said.\n\nMiss Dupont brought out the model book for him, and he and Mrs. Fallon\nstudied the facial and physical types that were very explicitly\nillustrated there in three-dimensional full color. Mr. Fallon,\ncontentedly working out math problems on a sheet of paper, left the\nchoice entirely to her.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Kalmar and Miss Dupont swiftly took care of a succession\nof other patients, raising the tolerance level of frustration in a\nwatchmaker, replating the acne-pitted skin of a sensitive youth,\nrestoring a finger lost in a machine-shop accident, and building up\ngood-natured aggression in an ore miner whose productivity had slumped.\n\nMrs. Fallon still hadn't decided when the last patient had been taken\ncare of. She said unhappily, \"I don't know. I simply absolutely don't\nknow. Couldn't you suggest _something_, Dr. Hoyt?\"\n\n\"Wouldn't be ethical,\" he told her bluntly. \"Not allowed to.\"\n\nDr. Kalmar, checking the Social Control papers with Miss Dupont,\nwondered if he should interfere. It would lower confidence in Dr. Hoyt,\nwhich meant that people would insist on Dr. Kalmar's treating them.\nThen, instead of having an assistant to remove some of the load, he'd\nhave to do the work of two men. He decided to let the young doctor\nhandle it.\n\nBut Dr. Hoyt stood up in exasperation, slammed the book shut, and said,\n\"Mrs. Fallon, if you know what you want, I'll be glad to oblige. But I'm\nnot a telepathy--\"\n\n\"Is there anything I can do?\" Dr. Kalmar interrupted quickly, before his\nassistant could create any more damage.\n\n\"He doesn't have to get huffy,\" Mrs. Fallon said indignantly. \"All I\nasked for was a suggestion or two.\"\n\n\"Insult my wife, will he?\" Mr. Fallon belligerently added.\n\n\"It's my fault,\" Dr. Kalmar said. \"Dr. Hoyt just got in today from Earth\nand he's tired and he naturally doesn't understand all our ways yet--\"\n\n\"_Yet?_\" Dr. Hoyt repeated in disgust. \"What makes you think I'll\never--\"\n\n\"And I shouldn't have burdened him with this problem until he's had a\nchance to rest up and look around,\" Dr. Kalmar continued in a slightly\nlouder voice. \"Now, let's see if we can't settle this problem before\nclosing time, eh?\"\n\nThe Fallons subsided, Dr. Hoyt watched with a sarcastic eye, though he\nkept silent as Dr. Kalmar and Miss Dupont, working as a shrewd team,\ngave them the suggestion they had been looking for. It was all done very\nsmoothly, so smoothly that Dr. Kalmar felt professional pride because\neven his stiff-necked assistant was unable to detect the fact that it\n_was_ a suggestion.\n\nDr. Kalmar got Mrs. Fallon to reminisce about the alterations her\nhusband had undergone, and Miss Dupont promptly agreed with her when she\nexplained why each had been unsatisfactory. It took some time, but he\neventually brought her back to what Mr. Fallon had looked like when\nshe'd first married him.\n\n\"Now, isn't that the strangest thing?\" she said, puzzled. \"I can't\nremember. Can you, dear?\"\n\n\"It's a little mixed up,\" Mr. Fallon admitted. \"Let's see, I know I was\ntaller and I think I had a long, thin face--\"\n\n\"Oh, we don't have to guess,\" Dr. Kalmar said. \"Nurse, we have the\ninformation on file, don't we?\"\n\n\"Yes, Doctor,\" she said, and instantly produced a photograph. They\nevidently thought it was merely filing efficiency; they hadn't noticed\nher searching for the picture quietly while Dr. Kalmar had been leading\nthem on. He had, in fact, delayed asking her until she'd nodded to\nindicate that she had found it.\n\nMr. Fallon frowned as if he'd recognized the face but couldn't remember\nthe name. His wife gave a little shriek of admiration.\n\n\"Why, Harry, you looked perfectly wonderful!\"\n\n\"Those deep dimples made shaving pretty hard,\" he recalled.\n\n\"But they're _darling_! Why did you ever let me change you?\"\n\n\"Because I wanted you to be happy, sweet.\"\n\nIt was as simple as that--a bit of practical psychology based on\nknowledge of the patients. Dr. Kalmar wished wistfully that old Dr.\nLowell had been there to observe. He would have approved, which might\nhave made up for Dr. Hoyt's unpleasant expression.\n\n\"I hope this is the one you want,\" Dr. Kalmar said as he took them to\nthe front door after the rephysical.\n\n\"Goodness, I hope so!\" Mrs. Fallon exclaimed. She looked fondly at her\nhusband, and this time had to look up to see his face. \"I'm almost\n_positive_ this is what I want Harry to be.\"\n\n\"Well, if it isn't, sweet,\" Mr. Fallon said, \"we'll try something else.\nI don't mind as long as it makes you happy.\"\n\nThey closed the door behind them, leaving the hospital empty of all but\nthe small staff.\n\n\"They're crazy!\" Dr. Hoyt exploded. \"He's not the one we should be\nchanging. That idiotic female needs a good Ego Alter!\"\n\n\"He hasn't asked for it,\" Dr. Kalmar pointed out patiently.\n\n\"Then he ought to!\"\n\n\"That's his decision, isn't it? There's such a thing as ethics, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"I've never seen anything more insane than the way you work,\" snapped\nDr. Hoyt. \"I can't wait to finish my stretch here and go home.\"\n\nHe stamped out, weaving slightly because of the sedative.\n\n\"Well, what do you think of our assistant?\" asked Dr. Kalmar.\n\n\"He's cute,\" Miss Dupont said irrationally.\n\nDr. Kalmar glowered at her. He'd forgotten that she was due to have a\nmate assigned to her this year.\n\n\n\nRoutine at the hospital was anything but routine. Dr. Hoyt barely kept\nfrom yelping each time someone was treated, and his help was given so\nunwillingly that Dr. Kalmar, sweating under a double load and with Dr.\nHoyt to argue with at the same time, was all for putting him on the ship\nand asking Earth for another intern. But Miss Dupont talked him out of\nit.\n\nFor no discernible reason other than loneliness, Dr. Hoyt was taking her\nout. She was pleased, even though he crabbed constantly about the\nshabby-looking clothes she wore, which were typical of Deneb, and the\nway they fitted her.\n\nEither the two of them didn't talk shop, or she had no influence with\nhim--his criticism and impatience grew sharper each week.\n\nIt bothered Dr. Kalmar more than he thought it should, and much more\nthan Mrs. Kalmar wanted it to. She was a pleasant little woman who liked\nthings as they were, which was why Dr. Kalmar had hesitated all this\nwhile to ask her to undergo a slight rephysical; he would have preferred\nher a little taller, more filled out, her slight wrinkles deleted and,\nwhile he was thinking about it, he wished she'd let him give her\nspace-black hair instead of her indeterminately blondish mop. But he'd\nrather have her as she was than peevish, so he had never mentioned it.\n\n\"Don't let the boy upset you, she said. \"It's only that he's so young\nand inexperienced. You can't expect him to adjust quickly to a new\nenvironment and a whole new medical orientation.\"\n\n\"But that's just what annoys me! Why, I used to hang onto every word of\nDr. Lowell's when I came here! I never thought I knew better than he\ndid.\"\n\n\"Well, dear, you're you and Dr. Lowell is Dr. Lowell and Dr. Hoyt is Dr.\nHoyt.\"\n\nHe tried to think of an answer and couldn't. \"I suppose so.\"\n\n\"Maybe you'd feel better if you spoke to Dr. Lowell about it.\"\n\n\"What could he do? This is really an internal problem that I should work\nout with Dr. Hoyt. I can't involve Dr. Lowell in it.\"\n\nBut it became intolerable when there was a young girl who wanted to be a\nboy and Dr. Kalmar and Dr. Hoyt got into the worst battle yet.\nNaturally, she had to be given an Ego Alter to make her happy about\nbeing a girl, whereas Dr. Hoyt argued that she should be allowed to be a\nboy if that was what she wanted. Dr. Kalmar explained angrily once more\nthat the sexes were exactly balanced and Dr. Hoyt quoted the rule of\npersonal choice. It was applicable on Earth, but not on Deneb, Dr.\nKalmar retorted, to which Dr. Hoyt snorted something about playing God.\n\nDr. Kalmar confessed harshly to his wife that she was right. He had to\nbring old Dr. Lowell into the situation; it was out of Dr. Kalmar's\ncontrol and was keeping the hospital in a turmoil. It was time for Dr.\nLowell to inspect the hospital, the job he had taken in place of actual\nretirement. Dr. Kalmar needed help from Miss Dupont to bring the problem\nout into the open. But she became unexpectedly obstinate.\n\n\"I won't hurt Leo's career,\" she explained flatly.\n\nDr. Kalmar gave her a vacant look. \"Leo?\"\n\nShe blushed. \"Dr. Hoyt. He's honestly trying to understand, but he finds\nit so different from Earth. Practically everything we do here is in\nreverse.\"\n\n\"But so is our environment, Miss Dupont. Earth is over-crowded and Deneb\nis under-populated, so of course our methods would be the opposite of\nEarth's. He has to be made to see that we must solve our problems our\nown way.\"\n\nShe studied his face suspiciously. \"That's all you want?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Damn it, do you think I want him fired and sent back to\nEarth before his internship's up? I know it would hurt his record.\nBesides, I need an assistant--but not one I have to bicker with every\ntime I make a move.\"\n\n\"Well, in that case--\"\n\n\"Good girl. All you have to do is help me hold off the cases he'd argue\nabout until Dr. Lowell gets here.\" He stared down glumly at his hands,\nwhich were gripping each other tightly. \"God knows I'm no diplomat. Dr.\nLowell is. He convinced me easily enough when I came here. Maybe he can\ndo the same with Dr. Hoyt.\"\n\n\"Oh, I hope he can,\" Miss Dupont said earnestly. \"I want so much to have\nyou and Leo work together in harmony.\"\n\nHe glanced up, curious. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I'm in love with him.\"\n\nHe found himself nodding bitterly. Having Dr. Hoyt go back to Earth\nwouldn't be a fraction as bad as Miss Dupont leaving with him. So now\nthere was something else to worry about.\n\n\n\nDr. Lowell came bouncing out of the jetcab a few days later. \"The\nhospital better be spotless!\" he called out jovially, paying off the\nhackie. \"I'm in a mean mood. Liable to suspend everybody.\"\n\nThere was a strange lift to Dr. Kalmar's spirits as the old man entered\nthe office. He wished without hope that he could inspire the same sort\nof reverence and respect. Impossible, of course. Dr. Lowell was great;\nhe himself was nothing more than competent.\n\nDr. Kalmar introduced his young assistant to the old man.\n\n\"Young and strong,\" Dr. Lowell approved. \"That's what we need on Deneb.\nSkill is important, but health and youth even more so.\"\n\n\"For those who stay,\" said Dr. Hoyt frostily. \"I'm not.\"\n\nDr. Kalmar felt himself quiver with rage. The wet-nosed pup couldn't\ntalk to Dr. Lowell like that!\n\nBut Dr. Lowell was saying cheerily, \"You seem to have made up your mind\nto go back. No matter. Some decisions are like egg-shells--made only to\nbe broken. I hope that's what you'll do with yours.\"\n\n\"Not a chance,\" Dr. Hoyt said. He didn't take the arrogant expression\noff his face even when Miss Dupont looked at him pleadingly.\n\n\"Then I say let's signal the next ship--\" Dr. Kalmar began.\n\nDr. Lowell cut in quickly, \"You two have patients to attend to, I see.\nDon't worry about me. I know my way around this poor little wretch of a\nbuilding. Not much like Earth hospitals, is it?\" He headed for the\nmedical supply room, adding just before he went in, \"A lot can be said\nfor small installations. The personal touch, you know.\"\n\nDr. Kalmar enviously realized how deftly the old man had put the\nyoungster in his place, whereas he would have stood there and slugged it\nout verbally. Lord, if he could only acquire that awesome wisdom!\n\n\"Well, back to work,\" he said, trying to imitate the cheeriness at\nleast.\n\n\"Sure, let's ruin some more lives,\" Dr. Hoyt almost snarled.\n\n\"Leo, _please_!\" whispered Miss Dupont imploringly.\n\nFive minutes later the two doctors were furiously arguing over a very\nold man who had been sent by Social Control to have his eyesight\nstrengthened.\n\n\"You have no right to let anybody dodder around like this!\" Dr. Hoyt\nyelled. \"What in hell is Rephysical for if not for such cases?\"\n\n\"You probably think we ought to make him look like 25 again,\" Dr. Kalmar\nyelled back. \"If that's all you've learned working here--\"\n\n\"Now, now,\" said Dr. Lowell soothingly. He'd come in unnoticed by either\nof the men. \"Dr. Hoyt is right, of course. We _would_ like to make old\npeople young and some day we'll be able to afford it. But not for some\ntime to come.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Dr. Hoyt demanded in a lower tone, visibly flattered by Dr.\nLowell's seemingly taking his side.\n\n\"Rephysical can't actually make anyone young. It can only give the\noutward appearance of youth and replace obviously diseased parts. But an\nold body is an old organism; it has to break down eventually. If we give\nit more vigor than it can endure, it breaks down too soon, much sooner\nthan if we let it age normally. That represents economic loss as well as\na humanitarian one.\"\n\n\"I don't follow you,\" Dr. Hoyt said bewilderedly.\n\n\"Well, our patient used to be a machinist. A good one. Now he's only\nable to be an oiler. A good one, too, when you improve his eyesight. He\ncan go on doing that for years, performing a useful function. But he'd\nwear himself out in no time as a machinist again if you de-aged him.\"\n\n\"Is that supposed to make sense?\"\n\n\"It does,\" said Dr. Lowell, \"for Deneb.\"\n\nDr. Hoyt wanted to continue the discussion, but Dr. Lowell was already\non his way to inspect another part of the hospital. Grumbling, the young\nman helped chart the optical nerves that had to be replaced and measure\nthe new curve of the retinas ordered by Social Control.\n\nBut he fought just as strenuously over other cases, especially a retired\nfreight-jet pilot who had to have his reflexes slowed down so he could\nbecome a contented meteorologist. Whenever there was a loud disagreement\nof this sort, Dr. Lowell was there to mediate calmly.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, Dr. Kalmar was emotionally exhausted. He said as\nhe and Dr. Lowell were washing up, \"The kid's hopeless. I thought you\ncould straighten him out--God knows I couldn't--but he'll never see why\nwe have to work the way we do.\"\n\n\"What do you suggest?\" Dr. Lowell asked through a towel.\n\n\"Send him back to Earth. Get an intern who's more malleable.\"\n\nDr. Lowell tossed the towel into the sterilizer. \"Can't be done. We're\nexpanding so fast all over the Galaxy that Earth can't train and ship\nout enough doctors for the new colonies. If we sent him back, I don't\nknow when we'd get another.\"\n\nDr. Kalmar swallowed. \"You mean it's him or nobody?\"\n\n\"Afraid so.\"\n\n\"But he'll never fit in on Deneb!\"\n\n\"You did,\" Dr. Lowell said.\n\nDr. Kalmar tried to smile modestly. \"I realized immediately how little I\nknew and how much more experience you had. I was willing to learn. Why,\nI used to listen to you and watch you work and try to see your reasons\nfor doing things--\"\n\n\"You think so?\" asked Dr. Lowell.\n\nDr. Kalmar glanced at him in astonishment. \"You know I did. I still do,\nfor that matter.\"\n\n\"When you landed on Deneb,\" said Dr. Lowell, \"you were the most\nstubborn, opinionated young ass I'd ever met.\"\n\nDr. Kalmar's smile became an appreciative grin. \"Damn, I wish I had that\nlight touch of yours!\"\n\n\"You were so dogmatic and argumentative that Dr. Hoyt is a suggestible\nschoolboy in comparison.\"\n\n\"Well, you don't have to go that far,\" Dr. Kalmar said. \"I get what\nyou're driving at--every intern needs orientation and I should be more\npatient and understanding.\"\n\n\"Then you don't follow me at all,\" stated Dr. Lowell. \"Invite Dr. Hoyt,\nMiss Dupont and me to your house for dinner tonight and maybe you'll get\na better idea of what I mean.\"\n\n\"Anything for a free meal, eh?\"\n\n\"And to keep a doctor here on Deneb that we'd lose otherwise.\"\n\n\"Implying that I can't do it.\"\n\n\"Isn't that the decision you'd come to?\"\n\n\"Yes, I guess it is,\" Dr. Kalmar confessed. \"All right, how about dinner\nat my house tonight? I'll round up the other two and call Harriet so\nshe'll expect us.\"\n\n\"Delighted to come,\" said Dr. Lowell. \"Nice of you to ask me.\"\n\nMiss Dupont was elated at the invitation and Dr. Hoyt said he had\nnothing else to do anyway. On the videophone Mrs. Kalmar was dismayed\nfor a moment, until Dr. Lowell told her to put through an emergency\norder to Central Commissary and he'd verify it.\n\nThat was when Dr. Kalmar realized how serious the old man was. On a raw\nplanet where crises were everyday routine, a situation had to be\ncatastrophic before it could be called an emergency.\n\n\n\nDinner on Deneb was the same as anywhere else in the Galaxy. To free\nwomen for other work, food was delivered weekly in cooked form. A\nspecial messenger from Central Commissary had brought the emergency\nrations and Mrs. Kalmar had simply punctured the self-heat cartridges\nand put the servings in front of each guest; the containers were\ndisposable plates and came with single-use plastic utensils. No garbage,\nno preparation, no cleaning up afterward, except to toss them all into\nthe converter furnace. Dr. Hoyt was still not accustomed to wholly grown\nfoods; he'd been raised on synthetics, of course, which were the staples\non Earth.\n\n\"Well, that was good,\" said Dr. Lowell, getting up from the table with\nhis round little belly comfortably expanded. \"Now, let's have a few\ndrinks before we start a professional bull session. Where do you keep\nyour liquor? I'd like to mix my special so Dr. Hoyt can see we colonials\nare not so provincial.\"\n\n\"Good Lord, I haven't had your special for years!\" exclaimed Dr. Kalmar.\n\"Since about the time I came to Deneb, in fact.\"\n\n\"That's why it's a special. Reserved for state occasions, such as\narrivals of colleagues from our dear old home planet.\"\n\n\"Oh, you don't have to go to all that bother,\" said Dr. Hoyt. \"You'd\nhave to make it twice--once now and once when I leave.\"\n\n\"That won't be for quite a while, will it?\" Miss Dupont asked anxiously.\n\n\"As soon as I finish my internship. No more alien worlds for me. I like\nEarth.\"\n\nMrs. Kalmar got him to talk about it, which was much easier than getting\nhim to stop, while Dr. Kalmar showed the old man where the liquor stock\nand fixings were kept. Watching him mix the ingredients with a chemist's\ncare, Dr. Kalmar felt a glow of nostalgia. He recalled the celebration\nat Dr. Lowell's house, several months after he had come from Earth, when\nhe'd enjoyed himself so much that he'd passed out. It was one of the\npleasanter memories of his start on Deneb.\n\n\"Can't mix them all in a single batch,\" Dr. Lowell explained, bringing\nthe drinks over one at a time as he finished preparing them. \"Mrs.\nKalmar ... Miss Dupont ... our gracious host, Dr. Kalmar ... and now Dr.\nHoyt and myself.\" He lifted his glass at Dr. Hoyt. \"Welcome to our\nlatest associate--product, like ourselves, of the great medical schools\nof Earth. It's a forlorn hope, but may he learn as much from us about\nour peculiar methods as we learn from him about the latest terrestrial\nadvances.\"\n\nDr. Hoyt, smiling as if he didn't think it possible, stood up when\nthey'd downed their toast to him. \"To Earth,\" he said. \"May I get back\nin record time.\" He gulped it, said, \"Delicious--for a colonial drink,\"\nand froze with his smile as fixed as if it had been painted on.\n\n\"Leo!\" Miss Dupont cried, and shook him, but he stayed frozen.\n\n\"The man's allergic to alcohol!\" said Dr. Kalmar, astonished.\n\n\"Do something!\" Mrs. Kalmar begged. \"Don't let him stand there like\nthat! He--he looks like a petrified man!\"\n\n\"Don't get panicky,\" said Dr. Lowell in a quiet, confident voice.\n\"That's when you passed out, Dr. Kalmar. Right after your first taste of\nmy special.\"\n\n\"But _we_ haven't,\" Dr. Kalmar objected.\n\n\"Naturally. Your drinks weren't drugged.\"\n\n\"Drugged?\" shrieked Miss Dupont. \"You doped him?\"\n\n\"That's rather obvious, isn't it?\"\n\n\"But--what for?\" Dr. Kalmar stammered.\n\n\"Same reason I slipped you a mickey not long after you got here. We\ncan't take any chances that he'll ship back to Earth. You see?\"\n\n\"I don't,\" raged Miss Dupont. \"I think it's a cheap, dirty, foul trick\nand it won't work, either. You can't _keep_ him drugged.\"\n\n\"I don't like you talking to Dr. Lowell like that,\" said Dr. Kalmar\nindignantly.\n\n\"You should be the last one to object,\" Mrs. Kalmar pointed out. \"He\nsaid he drugged you, too.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Dr. Kalmar said blankly. \"I don't understand--\"\n\n\"You will,\" promised Dr. Lowell. \"Just come along and don't interfere.\nBetter give him the order; it'll keep things straighter.\"\n\nMrs. Kalmar was grimly disapproving and Miss Dupont was close to\nhysteria. Only Dr. Kalmar retained his awed respect for Dr. Lowell. If\nthe old man said it was all right, it was, even if he couldn't see the\nreason.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" urged Dr. Lowell.\n\n\"Dr. Hoyt!\"\n\n\"Yes, Dr. Kalmar?\"\n\n\"You will come with us!\"\n\n\"Yes, Dr. Kalmar.\"\n\nDr. Lowell took them back to the hospital.\n\n\"Now what?\" asked Dr. Kalmar.\n\n\"You actually don't know?\" Miss Dupont demanded. \"He wants to put Leo\nthrough the Ego Alter.\"\n\n\"That's absurd,\" Dr. Kalmar said angrily, \"and an outright slander. Dr.\nLowell wouldn't consider such a thing--the boy didn't ask for it and it\nwasn't authorized by Social Control.\"\n\nDr. Lowell smiled genially and opened the door to the Ego Alter room. \"I\nhate to disillusion you, Dr. Kalmar. That's exactly what I have in\nmind--the same thing I did to you.\"\n\n\"That's absurd,\" Dr. Kalmar repeated, but with less conviction and more\nconfusion than before.\n\n\"It worked. Tell him to sit down.\"\n\nDr. Kalmar did, and automatically fitted the wired plastic helmet to Dr.\nHoyt's head.\n\n\"You can't!\" cried Miss Dupont as he reached for the dials on the\ncontrol console. \"It's not fair!\"\n\n\"Let's not get involved in a discussion on ethics,\" Dr. Lowell said.\n\"Deneb can't afford to lose him; we need every doctor we have. If he\ngoes back to Earth it may be years before we get a replacement.\"\n\n\"But you can't do it without his consent!\"\n\n\"There's time for that later,\" the old man grinned. \"Keep his eyes on\nyou, Dr. Kalmar, while you build up his father image. Cut down on\nhostility, aggression and power drive. Boost social responsibility and\nadventurousness. But make sure he's looking at you constantly.\"\n\n\"I won't allow it,\" said Mrs. Kalmar flatly. \"You won't make my husband\nviolate his oath.\"\n\n\"I did it to him, didn't I?\" Dr. Lowell replied jovially. \"It got you a\nhusband.\"\n\nMiss Dupont grabbed at Dr. Kalmar's hand, but he had already turned on\nthe current.\n\n\"Anything else?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well, he has to get married, of course,\" Dr. Lowell said. \"Let him look\nat Miss Dupont--she's scheduled for this year, isn't she?--while you\ngive him a shot of mating urge. Now, wipe out the memory of this\nincident and put him on a joy jag. We can validate that by liquoring him\nup afterward. When you're finished, bring him to.\"\n\nDr. Hoyt came out of it almost with a whoop. He lurched out of the\ninsulated seat, stared at Miss Dupont for a moment with eyes that almost\nglittered, and seized and kissed her.\n\n\"My goodness!\" she gasped.\n\n\"Now, what were you saying about ethics?\" Dr. Lowell asked.\n\nThere was no answer. Both Miss Dupont and Mrs. Kalmar had frozen.\n\n\"You drugged them, too?\" Dr. Kalmar weakly wanted to know.\n\n\"A bit slower-acting,\" admitted the old man. \"All you have to do with\nthem is wipe out the last half hour. Don't want any witnesses to an\nunethical act, you know. Oh, and put them on a jag also.\"\n\nDr. Kalmar followed instructions.\n\nFinished, they left the three uproariously drunk in the waiting room and\nwent to wash up. Dr. Kalmar went along bewilderedly. The old man was as\nunconcerned as if he did this sort of thing daily.\n\n\"I was as arrogant and belligerent as this squirt was?\"\n\n\"Worse,\" Dr. Lowell said. \"He was willing to finish out his internship.\nYou weren't. Still worried about the ethics?\"\n\n\"Yes. Naturally.\"\n\n\"All right, apply some logic, then. Are you happier on Deneb than you'd\nhave been on Earth?\"\n\n\"Well, certainly. I'd have been lucky to get a job doctoring in a summer\ncamp. I wouldn't trade a roomy planet like this for the jammed cubicles\nof Earth. And I like our methods better than terrestrial dogma. But\nthose are my preferences. I can't inflict them on anybody else.\"\n\n\"The hell they were your preferences. You bickered more about our\nmethods and longed more loudly for the tenements of Earth than this lad\never did. All it took was a slight Ego Alter and you have a happier life\nthan you would have had. Right?\"\n\nDr. Kalmar felt his tension ease. If the old man said it was right, it\nwas. He became momentarily resentful when he realized that that reaction\nhad been installed by Dr. Lowell, but then he smiled. It really was\nright. A bit arbitrary, perhaps, but for the good of Dr. Hoyt and Deneb\nin the long run, just as it had been for himself.\n\n\"Look,\" he said, drying his arms. \"I've been wanting my wife to go\nthrough a slight rephysical.\"\n\n\"Why don't you ask her?\"\n\n\"The fact is that I'm afraid she'll think I'm dissatisfied and I don't\nwant her to get resentful.\"\n\n\"Maybe she'd like you to do some changing, too.\"\n\n\"What for? I'm all right.\"\n\n\"She probably feels the same way about herself.\"\n\n\"But all I want are a few changes in her. She's as high as a space pilot\nnow. It would be a cinch to--\"\n\nDr. Lowell flung down the towel and gave him an outraged glare. \"There's\nsuch a thing as professional ethics, Dr. Kalmar!\"\n\n\"But you--\"\n\n\"That's different. It was a social decision, not a selfish one. If you\nask her and she agrees, that's up to her. But you can't take advantage\nof her in an egocentric, arbitrary way. You just try it and I'll have\nyou sent back to Earth.\"\n\nDr. Kalmar felt his knees grow weak in alarm. \"No, no. It's not that\nimportant. Just an insignificant kind of wish.\"\n\nAnd it was, he discovered when they went out to the waiting room. Unused\nto jags, Mrs. Kalmar was more affectionate than she'd been since they\nwere first married; he'd have to remember to go on them periodically\nwith her. Miss Dupont, unwilling to budge out of Dr. Hoyt's tight arms,\nhad glassily joyous eyes. Dr. Hoyt didn't let her go until he caught\nsight of Dr. Kalmar.\n\n\"Greatest doctor I ever met,\" he said enthusiastically. \"Won'ful planet,\nDeneb. Just wanna marry Miss Dupont, stay here and learn at your feet.\nOkay?\"\n\nDr. Kalmar's glance at the old man was no less worshipful. \"It couldn't\nbe okayer,\" he said.",
