Lift up yourselves to the\ngreat meaning of the day, and dare to think of your humanity as\nsomething so sublimely precious that it is worthy of being made\nan offering to God, and then go out to the pleasures and duties\nof your life, having been truly born anew into His Divinity, as\nHe was born into our humanity on Christmas Day.\n\n_Phillips Brooks._\n\n\n\n\nMost tangible of all the gods that be,\nO Santa Claus--our own since infancy!--\nAs first we scampered to thee--now, as then,\nTake us as children to thy heart again.\n\n_Riley._\n\n\n\nThen welcome snow of Christmas,\n  We read thy prophecy,\nWe know what wish lies hidden,\n  What germs of life may be\nConcealed beneath thy mantle,\n  All folded close away,\nAwaiting their fruition,\n  In heaven's eternal day.\n\n_M. C. O._\n\n\n\n\nOne wish ere yet the long year ends;\n  Let's close it with a parting rhyme,\nA pledge, a hand, to all our friends\n  As fits the merry Christmas time:\nOn life's wide scene you, too, have parts,\n  That Fate ere long shall bid you play;\nGood-night: with honest, gentle hearts,\n  A kindly greeting go alway.\n\n_Thackeray._\n\n\n\n\nIt was the winter wild,\nWhile the heaven-born child\n  All meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies:\nNature, in awe to him\nHad doff'd her gaudy trim,\n  With her great Master so to sympathize:\nIt was no season then for her\nTo wanton with the sun, her lusty paramour.\n\nOnly with speeches fair\nShe wooes the gentle air\n  To hide her guilty front with innocent snow:\nAnd on her naked shame,\nPollute with sinful blame,\n  The saintly veil of maiden white to throw;\nConfounded, that her Maker's eyes\nShould look so near upon her foul deformities.\n\nBut he, her fears to cease,\nSent down the meek-ey'd Peace;\n  She, crowned with olives green, came softly sliding\nDown through the turning sphere\nHis ready harbinger,\n  With turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing;\nAnd, waving wide her myrtle wand,\nShe strikes a universal peace through sea and land.\n\nNo war or battle's sound,\nWas heard the world around;\n  The idle spear and shield were high up hung,\nThe hooked chariot stood,\nUnstained with hostile blood;\n  The trumpet spake not to the armed throng;\nAnd kings sat still with awful eye,\nAs if they surely knew their sovran Lord was by.\n\nBut peaceful was the night,\nWherein the Prince of light\n  His reign of Peace upon the earth began:\nThe winds with wonder whist\nSmoothly the waters kist,\n  Whispering new joys to the mild ocean,\nWho now hath quite forgot to rave,\nWhile birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave.\n\n_Milton._\n\n\n\nSome say that ever 'gainst that season comes\nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,\nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long;\nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,\nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm,\nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\n\n_Shakespeare._\n\n\n\nO HOLY Child of Bethlehem!\n  Descend to us, we pray;\nCast out our sin, and enter in,\n  Be born in us to-day.\nWe hear the Christmas angels\n  The great glad tidings tell;\nOh come to us, abide with us,\n  Our Lord Emmanuel!\n\n_Phillips Brooks._\n\n\n\n\nSwell the notes of the Christmas Song!\n  Sound it forth through the earth abroad!\n  Blessing and honor, thanks and laud!\nTake the joy of the Christmas Song!\n  Are not the tidings good and true?\n    Peace to you,\n  And God's good will that is ever new.\n\n_Havergal._\n\n\n\n\nYou little children, in whose eyes\nUndimmed the light of heaven glows,\nWhose dreams are bright with paradise,\nWhose souls are whiter than the snows,\nFrom holy lips and undefiled,\nBreathe your soft prayer to Christ, the Child!\n\nAnd you whose thinning locks are sprent\n  With unreturning autumn's rime,\nWhose heads, like wind-worn trees, are bent\n  Beneath the savage storms of time--\nPray Christ, the Child, to be your guide\nPast the dim shoal, where shadows bide.\n\nO saving hands! O Christ, that hears\n  A mortal mother's lullabies;\nThat feels our agony and tears,\n  Whose bosom trembles with our sighs,\nGive us pure hearts and undefiled,\nMake us like thee, O Christ, the Child!\n\n_Unknown._\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHark! how all the welkin rings,\nGlory to the King of kings!\nPeace on earth, and mercy mild,\nGod and sinner reconciled!\nJoyful, all ye nations, rise,\nJoin the triumph of the skies;\nUniversal nature say,\nChrist the Lord is born to-day.\n\nChrist, by highest heaven adored;\nChrist, the everlasting Lord;\nLate in time behold Him come,\nOffspring of a Virgin's womb;\nVeil'd in flesh and Godhead see;\nHail, th' Incarnate Deity!\nPleased as man with men t' appear,\nJesus, our Immanuel here!\n\nHail! the heavenly Prince of Peace!\nHail! the Sun of Righteousness!\nLight and life to all He brings,\nRisen with healing in His wings.\nMild He lays His glory by,\nBorn that man no more may die,\nBorn to raise the sons of earth,\nBorn to give them second birth.\n\n_Charles Wesley._\n\n\n\n\nGod rest ye, merry gentlemen; let nothing you dismay,\nFor Jesus Christ, our Saviour, was born on Christmas-day.\nThe dawn rose red o'er Bethlehem, the stars shone through the gray,\nWhen Jesus Christ, our Saviour, was born on Christmas-day.\n\nGod rest ye, little children; let nothing you affright,\nFor Jesus Christ, your Saviour, was born this happy night;\nAlong the hills of Galilee the white flocks sleeping lay,\nWhen Christ, the Child of Nazareth, was born on Christmas-day.\n\nGod rest ye, all good Christians; upon this blessed morn\nThe Lord of all good Christians was of a woman born:\nNow all your sorrows He doth heal, your sins He takes away;\nFor Jesus Christ, our Saviour, was born on Christmas-day.\n\n_Dinah Maria Mulock._\n\n\n\nThere are many things from which I might have derived good, by which\nI have not profited, I dare say, Christmas among the rest. But I am\nsure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come\nround--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin,\nif anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good time;\na kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave,\nand not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And\ntherefore, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my\npocket, I believe that it _has_ done me good, and _will_ do me good;\nand I say, God bless it!\n\n_From \"A Christmas Carol.\"\nCharles Dickens._\n\n\n\nHark, the glad sound! the Saviour comes,\n  The Saviour promised long;\nLet every heart prepare a throne,\n  And every voice a song!\n\nHe comes, the prisoners to release\n  In Satan's bondage held;\nThe gates of brass before Him burst,\n  The iron fetters yield.\n\nHe comes, the broken heart to bind,\n  The bleeding soul to cure,\nAnd with the treasure of His grace\n  T' enrich the humble poor.\n\nOur glad Hosannas, Prince of Peace,\n  Thy welcome shall proclaim,\nAnd heaven's eternal arches ring\n  With thy beloved name.\n\n_Philip Doddridge._\n\n\n\n\nChrist is come to be my Friend,\n  Leading, loving to the end;\nChrist is come to be my King,\n  Ordering, ruling everything.\nChrist is come! Enough for me,\n  Lonely though the pathway be.\n\n_F. R. Havergal._\n\n\n\n\nYe who have scorn'd each other\nOr injured friend or brother,\n  In this fast fading year;\nYe who, by word or deed,\nHath made a kind heart bleed,\n  Come gather here.\nLet sinn'd against and sinning,\nForget their strife's beginning;\nBe links no longer broken,\nBe sweet forgiveness spoken,\n  Under the holly bough.\n\nYe who have lov'd each other,\nSister and friend and brother,\n  In this fast fading year:\nMother, and sire, and child,\nYoung man and maiden mild,\n  Come gather here;\nAnd let your hearts grow fonder,\nAs memory shall ponder\n  Each past unbroken vow.\nOld loves and younger wooing,\nAre sweet in the renewing,\n  Under the holly bough.\n\nYe who have nourished sadness,\nEstranged from hope and gladness,\n  In this fast fading year.\nYe with o'er-burdened mind\nMade aliens from your kind,\n  Come gather here.\n\n\n\n\nLet not the useless sorrow\nPursue you night and morrow,\n  If e'er you hoped--hope now--\nTake heart: uncloud your faces,\nAnd join in our embraces\n  Under the holly bough.\n\n_Charles Mackay, LL. D._\n\n\n\n\nCome all you weary wanderers\n  Beneath the wintry sky,\nThis day forget your worldly cares,\n  And lay your sorrows by:\n      Awake and sing\n      The church bells ring,\nFor this is Christmas morning!\n\nWith grateful hearts salute the morn,\n  And swell the streams of song,\nThat laden with great joy are borne,\n  The willing air along;\n      The tidings thrill\n      With right good will,\nFor this is Christmas morning!\n\nWe'll twine the fresh green holly wreath,\n  And make the yule-log glow;\nAnd gather gaily underneath\n  The winking mistletoe;\n      All blythe and bright\n      By the glad fire light,\nFor this is Christmas morning!\n\nCome, sing the carols old and true,\n  That mind us of good cheer,\nAnd like a heavenly fall of dew,\n  Revive the drooping year,\n      And fill us up\n      A wassail cup,\nFor this is Christmas morning!\n\n\n\n\nIn the rush of the merry morning\n  When the red burns through the gray,\nAnd the wintry world lies waiting\n  For the glory of the day;\nThen we hear a fitful rushing\n  Just without upon the stair,\nSee two white phantoms coming,\n  Catch the gleam of sunny hair.\n\nAre they Christmas fairies stealing\n  Rows of little socks to fill?\nAre they angels floating hither\n  With their message of good-will?\nWhat sweet spell are these elves weaving,\n  As like larks they chirp and sing?\nAre these palms of peace from heaven\n  That these lovely spirits bring?\n\nRosy feet upon the threshold,\n  Eager faces peeping through,\nWith the first red ray of sunshine,\n  Chanting cherubs come in view;\nMistletoe and gleaming holly,\n  Symbols of a blessed day,\nIn their chubby hands they carry,\n  Streaming all along the way.\n\n\n\nWell we know them, never weary\n  Of their innocent surprise:\nWaiting, watching, listening always\n  With full hearts and tender eyes,\nWhile our little household angels,\n  White and golden in the sun,\nGreet us with the sweet old welcome,--\n  \"Merry Christmas, every one!\"\n\n_Unknown._\n\n\n\n\nChristmas is here;\n  Winds whistle shrill,\n  Icy and chill,\nLittle care we;\n  Little we fear\n  Weather without,\n  Sheltered about\nThe mahogany tree.\n\nOnce on the boughs\n  Birds of rare plume\n  Sang in its bloom;\nNight-birds are we;\n  Here we carouse,\n  Singing, like them,\n  Perched round the stem\nOf the jolly old tree.\n\nHere let us sport,\n  Boys, as we sit;\n  Laughter and wit\nFlashing so free.\n  Life is but short--\n  When we are gone,\n  Let them sing on,\nRound the old tree.\n\n\n\nEvenings we knew,\n  Happy as this;\n  Faces we miss,\nPleasant to see.\n  Kind hearts and true,\n  Gentle and just,\n  Peace to your dust\nWe sing round the tree.\n\nCare, like a dun,\n  Lurks at the gate:\n  Let the dog wait;\nHappy we'll be!\n  Drink, every one;\n  Pile up the coals,\n  Fill the red bowls,\nRound the old tree!\n\nDrain we the cup,--\n  Friend, art afraid?\n  Spirits are laid\nIn the Red Sea.\n  Mantle it up;\n  Empty it yet;\n  Let us forget,\nRound the old tree.\n\nSorrows, begone!\n  Life and its ills,\n  Duns and their bills,\nBid me to flee.\n  Come with the dawn,\n  Blue-devil sprite,\n  Leave us to-night,\nRound the old tree.\n\n_W. M. Thackeray._\n\n\n\nNeath Mistletoe, should chance arise,\nYou may be happy if you're wise!\nThough bored you lie with Pantomime\nAnd Christmas fare and Christmas rhyme--\nOne fine old custom don't despise.\n\nIf you're a man of enterprise\nYou'll find, I venture to surmise,\n'Tis pleasant then at Christmas-time\n  'Neath Mistletoe!\n\nYou see they scarcely can disguise\nThe sparkle of their pretty eyes;\nAnd no one thinks it is a crime,\nWhen goes the merry Christmas chime,\nA rare old rite to exercise\n  'Neath Mistletoe!\n\n_J. Ashby Sterry._\n\n\n\n\nMist and cloud and darkness\n  Veil the wintry hour,\nBut the sun dispels them\n  With his rising power.\n\nMist and cloud and darkness\n  Often dim thy day\nBut a Christmas glory\n  Shines upon thy way.\n\nMay the Lord of Christmas,\n  Counsellor and Friend,\nLight thy desert pathway\n  Even to the end.\n\n_F. R. Havergal._",
