    "body": "\n\nBACK TO BACK\n\nMrs. Scutts, concealed behind the curtain, gazed at the cab in uneasy\namazement.  The cabman clambered down from the box and, opening the\ndoor, stood by with his hands extended ready for any help that might be\nneeded. A stranger was the first to alight, and, with his back towards\nMrs. Scutts, seemed to be struggling with something in the cab.  He\nplaced a dangling hand about his neck and, staggering under the weight,\nreeled backwards supporting Mr. Scutts, whose other arm was round the\nneck of a third man.  In a flash Mrs. Scutts was at the door.\n\n\"Oh, Bill!\"  she gasped.  \"And by daylight, too!\"\n\nMr. Scutts raised his head sharply and his lips parted; then his head\nsank again, and he became a dead weight in the grasp of his assistants.\n\n\"He's all right,\" said one of them, turning to Mrs. Scutts.\n\nA deep groan from Mr. Scutts confirmed the statement.\n\n\"What is it?\"  inquired his wife, anxiously.\n\n\"Just a little bit of a railway accident,\" said one of the strangers.\n\"Train ran into some empty trucks.  Nobody hurt--seriously,\" he added,\nin response to a terrible and annoyed groan from Mr. Scutts.\n\nWith his feet dragging helplessly, Mr. Scutts was conveyed over his own\ndoorstep and placed on the sofa.\n\n\"All the others went off home on their own legs,\" said one of the\nstrangers, reproachfully.  \"He said he couldn't walk, and he wouldn't go\nto a hospital.\"\n\n\"Wanted to die at home,\" declared the sufferer.  \"I ain't going to be\ncut about at no 'ospitals.\"\n\nThe two strangers stood by watching him; then they looked at each other.\n\nI don't want--no--'ospitals,\" gasped Mr. Scutts, \"I'm going to have my\nown doctor.\"\n\n\"Of course the company will pay the doctor's bill,\" said one of the\nstrangers to Mrs. Scutts or they'll send their own doctor.  I expect\nhe'll be all right to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I 'ope so,\" said Mr. Scutts, \"but I don't think it.  Thank you for\nbringing of me 'ome.\"\n\nHe closed his eyes languidly, and kept them closed until the men had\ndeparted.\n\n\"Can't you walk, Bill?\"  inquired the tearful Mrs. Scutts.\n\nHer husband shook his head.  \"You go and fetch the doctor,\" he said,\nslowly.  \"That new one round the corner.\"\n\n\"He looks such a boy,\" objected Mrs. Scutts.\n\n\"You go and fetch 'im,\" said Mr. Scutts, raising his voice.  \"D'ye\nhear!\"\n\n\"But--\" began his wife.\n\n\"If I get up to you, my gal,\" said the forgetful Mr. Scutts, \"you'll\nknow it.\"\n\n\"Why, I thought--\" said his wife, in surprise.\n\nMr. Scutts raised himself on the sofa and shook his fist at her.  Then,\nas a tribute to appearances, he sank back and groaned again.  Mrs.\nScutts, looking somewhat relieved, took her bonnet from a nail and\ndeparted.\n\nThe examination was long and tedious, but Mr. Scutts, beyond remarking\nthat he felt chilly, made no complaint.  He endeavoured, but in vain, to\nperform the tests suggested, and even did his best to stand, supported\nby his medical attendant.  Self-preservation is the law of Nature, and\nwhen Mr. Scutts's legs and back gave way he saw to it that the doctor\nwas underneath.\n\n\"We'll have to get you up to bed,\" said the latter, rising slowly and\ndusting himself.\n\nMr. Scutts, who was lying full length on the floor, acquiesced, and sent\nhis wife for some neighbours.  One of them was a professional furniture-\nremover, and, half-way up the narrow stairs, the unfortunate had to\nremind him that he was dealing with a British working man, and not a\npiano.  Four pairs of hands deposited Mr. Scutts with mathematical\nprecision in the centre of the bed and then proceeded to tuck him in,\nwhile Mrs. Scutts drew the sheet in a straight line under his chin.\n\n\"Don't look much the matter with 'im,\" said one of the assistants.\n\n\"You can't tell with a face like that,\" said the furniture-remover.\n\"It's wot you might call a 'appy face.  Why, he was 'arf smiling as we,\ncarried 'im up the stairs.\"\n\n\"You're a liar,\" said Mr. Scutts, opening his eyes.\n\n\"All right, mate,\" said the furniture-remover; \"all right.  There's no\ncall to get annoyed about it.  Good old English pluck, I call it.  Where\nd'you feel the pain?\"\n\n\"All over,\" said Mr. Scutts, briefly.\n\nHis neighbours regarded him with sympathetic eyes, and then, led by the\nfurniture-remover, filed out of the room on tip-toe.  The doctor, with a\nfew parting instructions, also took his departure.\n\n\"If you're not better by the morning,\" he said, pausing at the door,\n\"you must send for your club doctor.\"\n\nMr. Scutts, in a feeble voice, thanked him, and lay with a twisted smile\non his face listening to his wife's vivid narrative to the little crowd\nwhich had collected at the front door.  She came back, followed by the\nnext-door neighbour, Mr. James Flynn, whose offers of assistance ranged\nfrom carrying Mr. Scutts out pick-a-back when he wanted to take the air,\nto filling his pipe for him and fetching his beer.\n\n\"But I dare say you'll be up and about in a couple o' days,\" he\nconcluded.  \"You wouldn't look so well if you'd got anything serious the\nmatter; rosy, fat cheeks and----\"\n\n\"That'll do,\" said the indignant invalid.  \"It's my back that's hurt,\nnot my face.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Mr. Flynn, nodding sagely; \"but if it was hurt bad your\nface would be as white as that sheet-whiter.\"\n\n\"The doctor said as he was to be kep' quiet,\" remarked Mrs. Scutts,\nsharply.\n\n\"Right-o,\" said Mr. Flynn.  \"Ta-ta, old pal.  Keep your pecker up, and\nif you want your back rubbed with turps, or anything of that sort, just\nknock on the wall.\"\n\nHe went, before Mr. Scutts could think of a reply suitable for an\ninvalid and, at the same time, bristling with virility.  A sinful and\nfoolish desire to leap out of bed and help Mr. Flynn downstairs made him\nmore rubicund than ever.\n\nHe sent for the club doctor next morning, and, pending his arrival,\npartook of a basin of arrowroot and drank a little beef-tea.  A bottle\nof castor-oil and an empty pill-box on the table by the bedside added a\nlittle local colour to the scene.\n\n\"Any pain?\"  inquired the doctor, after an examination in which bony and\nvery cold fingers had played a prominent part.\n\n\"Not much pain,\" said Mr. Scutts.  \"Don't seem to have no strength in my\nback.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"  said the doctor.\n\n\"I tried to get up this morning to go to my work,\" said Mr. Scutts, \"but\nI can't stand!  couldn't get out of bed.\"\n\n\"Fearfully upset, he was, pore dear,\" testified Mrs. Scutts.  \"He can't\nbear losing a day.  I s'pose--I s'pose the railway company will 'ave to\ndo something if it's serious, won't they, sir?\"\n\n\"Nothing to do with me,\" said the doctor.  \"I'll put him on the club for\na few days; I expect he will be all right soon.  He's got a healthy\ncolour--a very healthy colour.\"\n\nMr. Scutts waited until he had left the house and then made a few\nremarks on the colour question that for impurity of English and strength\nof diction have probably never been surpassed.\n\nA second visitor that day came after dinner--a tall man in a frock-coat,\nbearing in his hand a silk hat, which, after a careful survey of the\nroom, he hung on a knob of the bedpost.\n\n\"Mr. Scutts?\"  he inquired, bowing.\n\n\"That's me,\" said Mr. Scutts, in a feeble voice.\n\n\"I've called from the railway company,\" said the stranger.  \"We have\nseen now all those who left their names and addresses on Monday\nafternoon, and I am glad to say that nobody was really hurt.  Nobody.\"\n\nMr. Scutts, in a faint voice, said he was glad to hear it.\n\n\"Been a wonder if they had,\" said the other, cheerfully.  \"Why, even the\npaint wasn't knocked off the engine.  The most serious damage appears to\nbe two top-hats crushed and an umbrella broken.\"\n\nHe leaned over the bed-rail and laughed joyously.  Mr. Scutts, through\nhalf-closed eyes, gazed at him in silent reproach.\n\n\"I don't say that one or two people didn't receive a little bit of a\nshock to their nerves,\" said the visitor, thoughtfully.  \"One lady even\nstayed in bed next day.  However, I made it all right with them.  The\ncompany is very generous, and although of course there is no legal\nobligation, they made several of them a present of a few pounds, so that\nthey could go away for a little change, or anything of that sort, to\nquiet their nerves.\"\n\nMr. Scutts, who had been listening with closed eyes, opened them\nlanguidly and said, \"Oh.\"\n\n\"I gave one gentleman twen-ty pounds!\"  said the visitor, jingling some\ncoins in his trouser-pocket.  \"I never saw a man so pleased and grateful\nin my life.  When he signed the receipt for it--I always get them to\nsign a receipt, so that the company can see that I haven't kept the\nmoney for myself--he nearly wept with joy.\"\n\n\"I should think he would,\" said Mr. Scutts, slowly--\"if he wasn't hurt.\"\n\n\"You're the last on my list,\" said the other, hastily.  He produced a\nslip of paper from his pocket-book and placed it on the small table,\nwith a fountain pen.  Then, with a smile that was both tender and\nplayful, he plunged his hand in his pocket and poured a stream of gold\non the table.\n\n\"What do you say to thir-ty pounds?\"  he said, in a hushed voice.\n\"Thirty golden goblins?\"\n\n\"What for?\"  inquired Mr. Scutts, with a notable lack of interest.\n\n\"For--well, to go away for a day or two,\" said the visitor.  \"I find you\nin bed; it may be a cold or a bilious attack; or perhaps you had a\nlittle upset of the nerves when the trains kissed each other.\"\n\n\"I'm in bed--because--I can't walk-or stand,\" said Mr. Scutts, speaking\nvery distinctly.  \"I'm on my club, and if as 'ow I get well in a day or\ntwo, there's no reason why the company should give me any money.  I'm\npore, but I'm honest.\"\n\n\"Take my advice as a friend,\" said the other; \"take the money while you\ncan get it.\"\n\nHe nodded significantly at Mr. Scutts and closed one eye.  Mr. Scutts\nclosed both of his.\n\n\"I 'ad my back hurt in the collision,\" he said, after a long pause.  \"I\n'ad to be helped 'ome.  So far it seems to get worse, but I 'ope for the\nbest.\"\n\n\"Dear me,\" said the visitor; \"how sad!  I suppose it has been coming on\nfor a long time.  Most of these back cases do.  At least all the doctors\nsay so.\"\n\n\"It was done in the collision,\" said Mr. Scutts, mildly but firmly. \"I\nwas as right as rain before then.\"\n\nThe visitor shook his head and smiled.  \"Ah! you would have great\ndifficulty in proving that,\" he said, softly; \"in fact, speaking as man\nto man, I don't mind telling you it would be impossible.  I'm afraid I'm\nexceeding my duty, but, as you're the last on my list, suppose--suppose\nwe say forty pounds.  Forty!  A small fortune.\"\n\nHe added some more gold to the pile on the table, and gently tapped Mr.\nScutts's arm with the end of the pen.\n\n\"Good afternoon,\" said the invalid.\n\nThe visitor, justly concerned at his lack of intelligence, took a seat\non the edge of the bed and spoke to him as a friend and a brother, but\nin vain.  Mr. Scutts reminded him at last that it was medicine-time,\nafter which, pain and weakness permitting, he was going to try to get a\nlittle sleep.\n\n\"Forty pounds!\"  he said to his wife, after the official had departed.\n\"Why didn't 'e offer me a bag o' sweets?\"\n\n\"It's a lot o' money,\" said Mrs. Scutts, wistfully.\n\n\"So's a thousand,\" said her husband.  \"I ain't going to 'ave my back\nbroke for nothing, I can tell you.  Now, you keep that mouth o' yours\nshut, and if I get it, you shall 'ave a new pair o' boots.\"\n\n\"A thousand!\"  exclaimed the startled Mrs. Scutts.  \"Have you took leave\nof your senses, or what?\"\n\n\"I read a case in the paper where a man got it,\" said Mr. Scutts.  \"He\n'ad his back 'urt too, pore chap.  How would you like to lay on your\nback all your life for a thousand pounds?\"\n\n\"Will you 'ave to lay abed all your life?\"  inquired his wife, staring.\n\n\"Wait till I get the money,\" said Mr. Scutts; \"then I might be able to\ntell you better.\"\n\nHe gazed wistfully at the window.  It was late October, but the sun\nshone and the air was clear.  The sound of traffic and cheerful voices\nascended from the little street.  To Mr. Scutts it all seemed to be a\npart of a distant past.\n\n\"If that chap comes round to-morrow and offers me five hundred,\" he\nsaid, slowly, \"I don't know as I won't take it.  I'm sick of this mouldy\nbed.\"\n\nHe waited expectantly next day, but nothing happened, and after a week\nof bed he began to realize that the job might be a long one.  The\nmonotony, to a man of his active habits, became almost intolerable, and\nthe narrated adventures of Mr. James Flynn, his only caller, filled him\nwith an uncontrollable longing to be up and doing.\n\nThe fine weather went, and Mr. Scutts, in his tumbled bed, lay watching\nthe rain beating softly on the window-panes.  Then one morning he awoke\nto the darkness of a London fog.\n\n\"It gets worse and worse,\" said Mrs. Scutts, as she returned home in the\nafternoon with a relish for his tea.  \"Can't see your 'and before your\nface.\"\n\nMr. Scutts looked thoughtful.  He ate his tea in silence, and after he\nhad finished lit his pipe and sat up in bed smoking.\n\n\"Penny for your thoughts,\" said his wife.\n\n\"I'm going out,\" said Mr. Scutts, in a voice that defied opposition.\n\"I'm going to 'ave a walk, and when I'm far enough away I'm going to\n'ave one or two drinks.  I believe this fog is sent a-purpose to save my\nlife.\"\n\nMrs. Scutts remonstrated, but in vain, and at half-past six the invalid,\nwith his cap over his eyes and a large scarf tied round the lower part\nof his face, listened for a moment at his front door and then\ndisappeared in the fog.\n\nLeft to herself, Mrs. Scutts returned to the bedroom and, poking the\ntiny fire into a blaze, sat and pondered over the willfulness of men.\n\nShe was awakened from a doze by a knocking at the street-door.  It was\njust eight o'clock, and, inwardly congratulating her husband on his\nreturn to common sense and home, she went down and opened it.  Two tall\nmen in silk hats entered the room.\n\n\"Mrs. Scutts?\"  said one of them.\n\nMrs. Scutts, in a dazed fashion, nodded.\n\n\"We have come to see your husband,\" said the intruder.  \"I am a doctor.\"\n\nThe panic-stricken Mrs. Scutts tried in vain to think.\n\n\"He-he's asleep,\" she said, at last.\n\n\"Doesn't matter,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Not a bit,\" said his companion.\n\n\"You--you can't see him,\" protested Mrs. Scutts.  \"He ain't to be seen.\"\n\n\"He'd be sorry to miss me,\" said the doctor, eyeing her keenly as she\nstood on guard by the inner door.  \"I suppose he's at home?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Mrs. Scutts, stammering and flushing.  \"Why, the pore\nman can't stir from his bed.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll just peep in at the door, then,\" said the doctor.  \"I won't\nwake him.  You can't object to that.  If you do--\"\n\nMrs. Scutts's head began to swim.  \"I'll go up and see whether he's\nawake,\" she said.\n\nShe closed the door on them and stood with her hand to her throat,\nthinking.  Then, instead of going upstairs, she passed into the yard\nand, stepping over the fence, opened Mr. Flynn's back door.\n\n\"Halloa!\"  said that gentleman, who was standing in the scullery\nremoving mud from his boots.  \"What's up?\"\n\nIn a frenzied gabble Mrs. Scutts told him.  \"You must be 'im,\" she said,\nclutching him by the coat and dragging him towards the door.  \"They've\nnever seen 'im, and they won't know the difference.\"\n\n\"But--\" exclaimed the astonished James.\n\n\"Quick!\"  she said, sharply.  \"Go into the back room and undress, then\nnip into his room and get into bed.  And mind, be fast asleep all the\ntime.\"\n\nStill holding the bewildered Mr. Flynn by the coat, she led him into the\nhouse and waved him upstairs, and stood below listening until a slight\ncreaking of the bed announced that he had obeyed orders.  Then she\nentered the parlour.\n\n\"He's fast asleep,\" she said, softly; \"and mind, I won't 'ave him\ndisturbed.  It's the first real sleep he's 'ad for nearly a week.  If\nyou promise not to wake 'im you may just have a peep.\"\n\n\"We won't disturb him,\" said the doctor, and, followed by his companion,\nnoiselessly ascended the stairs and peeped into the room.  Mr. Flynn was\nfast asleep, and not a muscle moved as the two men approached the bed on\ntip-toe and stood looking at him.  The doctor turned after a minute and\nled the way out of the room.\n\n\"We'll call again,\" he said, softly.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Mrs. Scutts.  \"When?\"\n\nThe doctor and his companion exchanged glances.  \"I'm very busy just at\npresent,\" he said, slowly.  \"We'll look in some time and take our chance\nof catching him awake.\"\n\nMrs. Scutts bowed them out, and in some perplexity returned to Mr.\nFlynn. \"I don't like the look of 'em,\" she said, shaking her head.\n\"You'd better stay in bed till Bill comes 'ome in case they come back.\"\n\n\"Right-o,\" said the obliging Mr. Flynn.  \"Just step in and tell my\nlandlady I'm 'aving a chat with Bill.\"\n\nHe lit his pipe and sat up in bed smoking until a knock at the front\ndoor at half-past eleven sent him off to sleep again.  Mrs. Scutts, who\nwas sitting downstairs, opened it and admitted her husband.\n\n\"All serene?\"  he inquired.  \"What are you looking like that for?\nWhat's up?\"\n\nHe sat quivering with alarm and rage as she told him, and then, mounting\nthe stairs with a heavy tread, stood gazing in helpless fury at the\nslumbering form of Mr. James Flynn.\n\n\"Get out o' my bed,\" he said at last, in a choking voice.\n\n\"What, Bill!\"  said Mr. Flynn, opening his eyes.\n\n\"Get out o' my bed,\" repeated the other.  \"You've made a nice mess of it\nbetween you.  It's a fine thing if a man can't go out for 'arf a pint\nwithout coming home and finding all the riffraff of the neighbourhood in\n'is bed.\"\n\n\"'Ow's the pore back, Bill?\"  inquired Mr. Flynn, with tenderness.\n\nMr. Scutts gurgled at him.  \"Outside!\"  he said as soon as he could get\nhis breath.\n\n\"Bill,\" said the voice of Mrs. Scutts, outside the door.\n\n\"Halloa,\" growled her husband.\n\n\"He mustn't go,\" said Mrs. Scutts.  \"Those gentlemen are coming again,\nand they think he is you.\"\n\n\"WHAT!\" roared the infuriated Mr. Scutts.\n\n\"Don't you see?  It's me what's got the pore back now, Bill,\" said Mr.\nFlynn.  \"You can't pass yourself off as me, Bill; you ain't good-looking\nenough.\"\n\nMr. Scutts, past speech, raised his clenched fists to the ceiling.\n\n\"He'll 'ave to stay in your bed,\" continued the voice of Mrs. Scutts.\n\"He's got a good 'art, and I know he'll do it; won't you, Jim?\"\n\nMr. Flynn pondered.  \"Tell my landlady in the morning that I've took\nyour back room,\" he said.  \"What a fortunit thing it is I'm out o' work.\nWhat are you walking up and down like that for, Bill?  Back coming on\nagin?\"\n\n\"Then o' course,\" pursued the voice of Mrs. Scutts, in meditative\naccents, \"there's the club doctor and the other gentleman that knows\nBill.  They might come at any moment.  There's got to be two Bills in\nbed, so that if one party comes one Bill can nip into the back room, and\nif the other Bill--party, I mean--comes, the other Bill--you know what I\nmean!\"\n\nMr. Scutts swore himself faint.\n\n\"That's 'ow it is, mate,\" said Mr. Flynn.  \"It's no good standing there\nsaying your little piece of poetry to yourself.  Take off your clo'es\nand get to bed like a little man.  Now! now!  Naughty!  Naughty!\"\n\n\"P'r'aps I oughtn't to 'ave let 'em up, Bill,\" said his wife; \"but I was\nafraid they'd smell a rat if I didn't.  Besides, I was took by\nsurprise.\"\n\n\"You get off to bed,\" said Mr. Scutts.  \"Get off to bed while you're\nsafe.\"\n\n\"And get a good night's rest,\" added the thoughtful Mr. Flynn.  \"If\nBill's back is took bad in the night I'll look after it.\"\n\nMr. Scutts turned a threatening face on him.  \"For two pins--\" he began.\n\n\"For two pins I'll go back 'ome and stay there,\" said Mr. Flynn.\n\nHe put one muscular leg out of bed, and then, at the earnest request of\nMr. Scutts, put it back again.  In a few simple, manly words the latter\napologized, by putting all the blame on Mrs. Scutts, and, removing his\nclothes, got into bed.\n\nWrapped in bedclothes, they passed the following day listening for\nknocks at the door and playing cards.  By evening both men were weary,\nand Mr. Scutts made a few pointed remarks concerning dodging doctors and\ndeceitful visitors to which Mr. Flynn listened in silent approval.\n\n\"They mightn't come for a week,\" he said, dismally.  \"It's all right for\nyou, but where do I come in?  Halves?\"\n\nMr. Scutts had a rush of blood to the head.\n\n\"You leave it to me, mate,\" he said, controlling himself by an effort.\n\"If I get ten quid, say, you shall have 'arf.\"\n\n\"And suppose you get more?\"  demanded the other.\n\n\"We'll see,\" said Mr. Scutts, vaguely.\n\nMr. Flynn returned to the charge next day, but got no satisfaction.  Mr.\nScutts preferred to talk instead of the free board and lodging his\nfriend was getting.  On the subject of such pay for such work he was\nalmost eloquent.\n\n\"I'll bide my time,\" said Mr. Flynn, darkly.  \"Treat me fair and I'll\ntreat you fair.\"\n\nHis imprisonment came to an end on the fourth day.  There was a knock at\nthe door, and the sound of men's voices, followed by the hurried\nappearance of Mrs. Scutts.\n\n\"It's Jim's lot,\" she said, in a hurried whisper.  \"I've just come up to\nget the room ready.\"\n\nMr. Scutts took his friend by the hand, and after warmly urging him not\nto forget the expert instructions he had received concerning his back,\nslipped into the back room, and, a prey to forebodings, awaited the\nresult.\n\n\"Well, he looks better,\" said the doctor, regarding Mr. Flynn.\n\n\"Much better,\" said his companion.\n\nMrs. Scutts shook her head.  \"His pore back don't seem no better, sir,\"\nshe said in a low voice.  \"Can't you do something for it?\"\n\n\"Let me have a look at it,\" said the doctor.  \"Undo your shirt.\"\n\nMr. Flynn, with slow fingers, fumbled with the button at his neck and\nlooked hard at Mrs. Scutts.\n\n\"She can't bear to see me suffer,\" he said, in a feeble voice, as she\nleft the room.\n\nHe bore the examination with the fortitude of an early Christian martyr.\nIn response to inquiries he said he felt as though the mainspring of his\nback had gone.\n\n\"How long since you walked?\"  inquired the doctor.\n\n\"Not since the accident,\" said Mr. Flynn, firmly.\n\n\"Try now,\" said the doctor.\n\nMr. Flynn smiled at him reproachfully.\n\n\"You can't walk because you think you can't,\" said the doctor; \"that is\nall.  You'll have to be encouraged the same way that a child is.  I\nshould like to cure you, and I think I can.\"\n\nHe took a small canvas bag from the other man and opened it.  \"Forty\npounds,\" he said.  \"Would you like to count it?\"\n\nMr. Flynn's eyes shone.\n\n\"It is all yours,\" said the doctor, \"if you can walk across the room and\ntake it from that gentleman's hand.\"\n\n\"Honour bright?\" asked Mr. Flynn, in tremulous tones, as the other man\nheld up the bag and gave him an encouraging smile.\n\n\"Honour bright,\" said the doctor.\n\nWith a spring that nearly broke the bed, Mr. Flynn quitted it and\nsnatched the bag, and at the same moment Mrs. Scutts, impelled by a\nmaddened arm, burst into the room.\n\n\"Your back!\"  she moaned.  \"It'll kill you Get back to bed.\"\n\n\"I'm cured, lovey,\" said Mr. Flynn, simply.\n\n\"His back is as strong as ever,\" said the doctor, giving it a thump.\n\nMr. Flynn, who had taken his clothes from a chair and was hastily\ndressing himself, assented.\n\n\"But if you'll wait 'arf a tick I'll walk as far as the corner with\nyou,\" he said, quickly.  \"I'd like to make sure it's all right.\"\n\nHe paused at the foot of the stairs and, glancing up at the palid and\nmurderous face of Mr. Scutts, which protruded from the back bedroom,\nsmiled at him rapturously.  Then, with a lordly air, he tossed him five\npieces of gold.",
