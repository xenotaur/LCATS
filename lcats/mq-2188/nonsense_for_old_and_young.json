The entire number of these quips was about 162, of which 94\nwere first published in book form as _The Tribune Primer_, in 1881.\nThe balance, with the exception of five which are so local in their\napplication that they have now lost some of their fine sarcastic humor,\nwe here present for the first time with illustrations.\n\nIn their original form the sketches were designated by Roman Numerals\ninstead of titles and were made up of short sentences, with a liberal\ndisplay of capital letters after the style of first lessons in reading\nfor children.\n\n                                                       THE PUBLISHERS.\n\n\n\n\nNonsense for Old & Young.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne Autumn Night.\n\n\n    A calm, delightful autumn night;\n    A moon\u2019s mysterious, misty light;\n    A maiden at her window height,\n    In proper robe of fleecy white.\n\n                    \u2766\n\n    The little wicket gate ajar;\n    A lover tripping from afar,\n    With tuneful voice and light guitar,\n    To woo his radiant guiding star.\n\n                    \u2766\n\n    The lute gave forth a plaintive twang--\n    Oh, how that doting lover sang!\n    A bull-dog with invidious fang--\n    A nip, a grip, and then a pang!\n\n                    \u2766\n\n    A maiden swooning in affright.\n    A lover in a piteous plight,\n    A canine quivering with delight--\n    A wild, delirious autumn night!\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nA Portrait of a Lady.\n\nHere we have a Lady. She was at a Party last Night, and the Paper spoke\nof her as the Amiable and Accomplished Wife of our Respected Fellow\nCitizen. Our Respected Fellow Citizen is now as Full as a Tick, and his\nAmiable and Accomplished Wife is Walloping him with the Rolling Pin.\nThe Lady seems to be more Accomplished than Amiable.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nWould You?\n\nIs this a Picture of an Actress? No, it is a Picture of a Boodle\nPolitician. Is it not Beautiful? The left Eye is Closed. It must be\nTired. He is Sitting on a Barrel. It must be a Barrel of Jam. Would you\nlike to get your Little Hand into the Barrel? We Would.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood James and Naughty Reginald.\n\n\nOnce upon a Time there was a Bad boy whose Name was Reginald and there\nwas a Good boy whose Name was James. Reginald would go Fishing when his\nMamma told him Not to, and he Cut off the Cat\u2019s Tail with the Bread\nKnife one Day, and then told Mamma the Baby had Driven it in with the\nRolling Pin, which was a Lie. James was always Obedient, and when his\nMamma told him not to Help an old Blind Man across the street or Go\ninto a Dark Room where the Boogies were, he always Did What She said.\nThat is why they Called him Good James. Well, by and by, along Came\nChristmas. Mamma said, You have been so Bad, my son Reginald, you will\nnot Get any Presents from Santa Claus this Year; but you, my Son James,\nwill get Oodles of Presents, because you have Been Good. Will you\nBelieve it, Children, that Bad boy Reginald said he didn\u2019t Care a Darn\nand he Kicked three Feet of Veneering off the Piano just for Meanness.\nPoor James was so sorry for Reginald that he cried for Half an Hour\nafter he Went to Bed that Night. Reginald lay wide Awake until he saw\nJames was Asleep and then he Said if these people think they can Fool\nme, they are Mistaken. Just then Santa Claus came down the Chimney. He\nhad lots of Pretty Toys in a Sack on his Back. Reginald shut his Eyes\nand Pretended to be Asleep. Then Santa Claus Said, Reginald is Bad and\nI will not Put any nice Things in his Stocking. But as for you, James,\nI will Fill your Stocking Plumb full of Toys, because You are Good. So\nSanta Claus went to Work and Put, Oh! heaps and Heaps of Goodies in\nJames\u2019 stocking but not a Sign of a Thing in Reginald\u2019s stocking. And\nthen he Laughed to himself and Said, I guess Reginald will be Sorry\nto-morrow because he Was so Bad. As he said this he Crawled up the\nchimney and rode off in his Sleigh. Now you can Bet your Boots Reginald\nwas no Spring Chicken. He just Got right Straight out of Bed and\nchanged all those Toys and Truck from James\u2019 stocking into his own.\nSanta Claus will Have to Sit up all Night, said He, when he Expects to\nget away with my Baggage. The next morning James got out of Bed and\nwhen He had Said his Prayers he Limped over to his Stocking, licking\nhis chops and Carrying his Head as High as a Bull going through a Brush\nFence. But when he found there was Nothing in his stocking and that\nReginald\u2019s Stocking was as Full as Papa Is when he comes home Late from\nthe Office, he Sat down on the Floor and began to Wonder why on Earth\nhe had Been such a Good boy. Reginald spent a Happy Christmas and James\nwas very Miserable. After all, Children, it Pays to be Bad, so Long as\nyou Combine Intellect with Crime.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nHis Busy Day.\n\nThis Man is very Busy. He is pushed for Time. He looks as if he had\nmore on his Hands than he could accomplish. We feel Sorry for him. He\nhas an Important Engagement to Keep, and he is Hurrying up Matters to\nMeet it. He is to be Hung at Noon to-morrow.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nThe Joyful Whirligig.\n\nHere is a Sewing Machine. It was Made for little Children to play with.\nPut your Feet on the Treadles and Make the Wheels go round Fast. See\nhow the Thread unwinds and the Needle bobs up and down! This is Lots of\nFun. Do not Deny baby the privilege of Putting his Fat little Finger\nunder the Needle. It will Make pretty holes in the Finger and give Baby\nsomething to occupy his Attention for a Long time.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nA Fairy Tale.\n\nHere we have Papa\u2019s watch. There is a Fairy in the Watch. Would you\nLike to Hear her Sing? If you will Drop the Watch on the Floor, the\nFairy in the Watch will Sing the Prettiest little Song you ever Heard\nand all the Wheels will Buzz just as Funny as can Be. When papa Comes\nhome and finds the Fairy has been Singing, maybe he will Ask you to\nStep out into the Woodshed with him on a Matter of Business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Epitaph.\n\n\n    Here lies the body of Mary Ann\n    Who rests in the bosom of Abraham.\n    It\u2019s all very nice for Mary Ann,\n    But it\u2019s mighty tough on Abraham.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nThe Hustler Hustling.\n\nWhat is that I see? That my Child, is the _News_ Interviewer, I and\nhe is now Interviewing a Man. But where I can see no Man. The Man, my\nChild is in his Mind.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nThe Maid of Orleans.\n\nHere is a Molasses jug. It is Full of Molasses. How many Flies are\nthere in the Molasses? That is a Hard one to Answer. Those flies will\nLook Proud spread out on Sister Lucy\u2019s buckwheat Cakes in the Mornings.\nBut Lucy will not Care. She will pick them out of the Molasses with her\nTaper Fingers, and Wipe them on the Bottom of her Chair. But if her\nBeau were there she would Yell and say, Oh, how Horrid. The strength of\na Woman\u2019s Stomach depends Largely on the surroundings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFancy vs. Fact.\n\n\nMabel is sitting at the Piano, and she is Singing a Song. The Song\nSays he is Waiting for Her in the Gloaming. Mabel appears to be giving\nherself Dead Away. He is Not Waiting for her In the Gloaming at all.\nHe has just Drawn a bobtail Flush, and he is Wondering whether he had\nBetter Pull out or stand in on a Bluff. Mabel would Touch a Responsive\nChord in his Bosom if she were to Sing take Back the Hand which thou\nGavest.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nSociety as Reported.\n\nThis is a Recherch\u00e9 Affair. Recherch\u00e9 Affairs are sometimes Met with in\nParlors and Ball Rooms but more Generally in the Society Department of\nNewspapers. A Recherch\u00e9 Affair is an Affair where the Society Editor is\ninvited to the Refreshment Table. When the Society Editor is told his\nRoom is Better than his Company, the Affair is not Recherch\u00e9.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nA Musical Genius.\n\nWho is the Man? The Man is Admiral McLean and he is Getting Ready to\nSing. Can the Admiral Sing? Those who have heard him Say he Can Not.\nHas he ever Sung a Song Through? Nobody can Tell.

He carries big\nTrunks all over the Country and Makes Love to Dining room Girls. He\nhas Been all Over and Under Europe and Taken in all the Great Masters.\nHe has Scoured the Alps clean. He can Tell more Smutty Stories than\na Politician, and he can get Bilin\u2019 slower on More Liquor than any\nGovernment official. The best Way to get along with the Travelling men\nis to get along Without them.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nLunar Lore.\n\nThe Moon is a Satellite. A Satellite is a Sort of Associate Editor.\nIt revolves around Somebody Else and gets full on Four Quarters.\nThe Moon is a great Way from the Earth. It would Take a Street Car\n16,000,000,239 years to Make the Distance. A Snail could Make it in\nhalf that Time. Break a piece of Glass out of Mamma\u2019s mirror, Smoke it\nover the Lamp, and look at the Moon through it.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nThe Senator.\n\nHere we have a Senator.

But not too Happy. Just Happy Enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Colonial Accident.\n\n\nMajor Andr\u00e9 was a British officer. Benedict Arnold hired him for Four\nDollars a day to go as Spy into the American Camp and hear the News.

Then they said they would hang him.\nHe was sorry for what he had Done and Said he was going to Heaven. He\nfell with a Dull, Sickening Thud. They are going to Build a Monument to\nhim, not because he did Wrong, but because he got Caught.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nA Natural Mistake.\n\nIs this an Ass?

Why did you think it was a fire? Because it looked so Red. The\nJudge is a Nice Man. He writes Articles about the Governor. You must\nnot Mistake Him for a Fire again.

There must be a Boy Planted somewhere Near it.\nWouldn\u2019t you Like to be Planted under a Cute little Stone like That?\nUnless you do Justice to your Dinner to-day you cannot Hope for such a\nReward of Merit.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nBeautiful Hortense.\n\nMiss Hortense is working a Beautiful Piece of Embroidery. It is a Motto\nin Green and Gold. It asks What is Home without a Mother. When Miss\nHortense gets it Done, she will Give it to her Beau, who Tends a Dry\nGoods counter. You cannot see Miss Hortense\u2019s Mother. She is in the\nBack Yard doing the Week\u2019s Washing. By and by she will be Bringing\nin Coal for the Parlor Stove, because Miss Hortense\u2019s beau is Coming\nto-night.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nA Toilet Episode.\n\nMamma\u2019s Tooth-brush is on the Bureau. Suppose we scrub out the Sink\nwith it. Then Mamma will wonder what she has Eaten to give her such a\nBad Breath. She will Think the Tooth-brush has been Sitting up with a\nCorpse.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nA Terrible Monster.\n\nOh, what an awful Sight! It is the Editor of the Colorado Springs\n_Gazette_. He has Long, White Teeth and there is Blood on his gums. He\nis a Bad Man and he has just Eaten a Poor Little Baby. He is trying to\nget the Capital Removed. If he gets the Capital Removed, he will Eat a\nPoor Little Baby every Day. You must Tell your Dear Papa not to vote to\nhave the Capital Removed.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nPoor Pussy.\n\nHere we have a Dornick and a Cat. The Cat is Approaching the Well. She\nthinks there is a Mouse there. Suppose we approach the well with the\nDornick. There is no Mouse as we Can See. Perhaps the Mouse is at the\nBottom of the Well. Let us Hitch the Dornick to the Cat and Put Them in\nthe Well. Then the Cat will not Come back without the Mouse.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nA Fish Story.\n\nSee the Fish. The Fish is a Trout and Breathes through his Ears. He\nlives in a Brook and May be if you try you can Catch him. Any little\nBoy who catches so many measles ought to be Able to Catch one little\nFish. The Trout Weighs four Ounces, but you can say he weighs four\nPounds. Do not call him a Speckled Beauty or you will be Shot. Eat him,\nHead, Tail, Inwards and All, and get a little Bone in your Throat if\nyou Can.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nBeware.\n\n    Oh, children you Must never chew Tobacco--it is Awful!\n    The Juice will Quickly make You sick,\n      If once you get your Maw Full.\n\n    --_S. J. Tilden._\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Vigilant Cop.\n\n\nDo not Make a Noise or you will Wake the Policeman! He is Sitting on\nthe Door Step asleep. It is very Hard on Him to Have to Sleep out of\nDoors these Cold Nights. There is a Bank being Robbed around the Corner\nand a Woman is being killed in the next Block. If the Policeman Waked\nup, he might Find it out and Arrest somebody. Some people Believe this\nis what Policemen are for, but the Policemen do not Think so.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nSomething Doing.\n\nIs this a Cemetery? No, it is a Picture of Pueblo during the Busy\nSeason. Do you see the Man Patting the Dog on the Back and Promising\nhim a Bone if he will lie Down and Go to Sleep again? This is What they\nCall an Intensely Exciting Sensation in Pueblo. The Earth is going to\nLive five hundred Million years Longer, and Pueblo expects to be the\nState Capital before the End of that Time. You will not Live to see it\nthe Capital--or, at least, you ought to Hope Not.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nPoor Little Bennie.\n\nBennie is Lying in the Cradle and he is Crying because Mamma will not\ngive him the Moon. What a Naughty Mamma not to Give her little Boy the\nMoon! But Mamma does not care how much Bennie Cries. She has a Son, and\nthe Moon can go to Thunder.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nOur Motor Press.\n\nIs this Not a Beautiful steam Press? The Steam is Lying Down on the\nFloor taking a Nap. He came from Africa and is Seventy years Old. The\npress Prints Papers. It can Print nine hundred papers an Hour. It takes\nOne hour and Forty Minutes to Print the Edition of the Paper. The paper\nhas a circulation of Thirty-seven Thousand. The Business Manager says\nSo.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nFreedom Defined.\n\nWhy is this great and glorious country called America? Principally\nbecause that is its name. Can you bound it? No, because it is a\nrepublic and will not be bound.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nA Political Object Lesson.\n\nDo you see that Candidate over There! He is standing still. He is a\nDemocratic Candidate. If he were a Republican he Would be Running.\nDemocratic Candidates are not real Candidates. They can not Run. They\ndo not even Walk. When you are very Tired and Want to rest you ought to\nBecome a Democratic Candidate.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nHonesty on the Run.\n\nIf a poor but honest voter chases a reformer four blocks in ten\nhours, how many blocks will he have to go to catch him? This depends\naltogether on the location of the Bank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Truth About the Cherry Tree.\n\n\nWho was George Washington? He was Mrs. Washington\u2019s little Boy. One\nDay he went out in the Orchard and got the Hired Man to chop down a\ncherry tree. \u201cWho has done this Deed?\u201d asked George\u2019s mother that Very\nAfternoon. There was Blood in the Old Lady\u2019s Eye. In order not to get\nfired, the Hired Man gave George two marbles and a Top to say he Did\nit. \u201cMamma,\u201d said George, \u201cI cannot Tell a Lie. I Done it with the Ax.\u201d\nWhereupon his Mother complimented him on his Truthfulness, but gave him\nOne in the Neck for using Bad Grammar.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nAn Ode to a Cat.\n\n    A hungry Cat--\n    A foolish Rat.\n      A lively Run--\n      Exciting Fun.\n\n    Ferocious Jaws--\n    Remorseless Claws.\n      A dying Squeal--\n      A hearty Meal.\n\n    Alas, poor Rat!\n    O happy Cat!\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nLook Out! Boogies!\n\nDid you ever see a Bugaboo? Ask Mamma to Blow out the Light to-night\nafter you Go to Bed and Let you See a Bugaboo? It has a Big Voice like\na Bear, and its Claws are as long as a Knife. It will Bite Good Little\nChildren and Run off with them to the Cold Dark Woods where they can\nNever see Mamma any More. If you are Good, Beware of Bugaboos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Air vs. Cold Water.\n\n\nSee the Wind Mill. It is a Pretty Sight. It has Sails that go Round\nand Round and Make a Noise like the Whirring of a bird\u2019s wings. The\nWind Mill Looks Sad. It has had Hard Luck. It used to be a Democratic\npolitician and Furnish Enthusiasm for Arapahoe county Campaigns. But\nWind will not Run a Campaign and so the Wind Mill lost its Job. And\nnow it Stands out on a Bleak Prairie and Hauls water out of the Cold,\nhard Earth for a living. Any Kind of Honest Labor is awful rough on a\nDemocrat, but Having Anything to Do with Water breaks him All Up.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nThe Worried Magnate.\n\nWho is the old man I see? The old man is a Railroad Builder, and his\nbrow is clouded. Why is his brow clouded? It is clouded because this\nis Monday and he cannot build any railroad track. Why can he not build\nrailroad track on Monday? Because he is pious and remembers the Sabbath\nday to keep everybody he can hire wholly--busy. He only builds on\nSunday. This is the reason he is so much respected in saloons and other\nmercantile establishments.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nHis Day of Rest.\n\nIs this a Sunday? Yes, it is a Sunday. How Peaceful and Quiet it is.\nBut Who is the Man! He does not Look Peaceful. He is a reporter and he\nis Swearing. What makes him Swear? Because he has to Work on Sunday?\nOh, no! He is Swearing because he has to Break the Fourth Commandment.\nIt is a sad thing to be a Reporter.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nThe Foxy Compositor.\n\nHas the Printer tobacco? He has But he will not Tell you So. He carries\nit in the Leg of his Boot and when he wants a Chew he Sneaks down in\nthe Back Alley where Nobody can See him. When he Spits tobacco, it\nSounds like a Duck diving in the Water. The printer is a Queer man. He\nis a Fickle person. Sometimes he has Ten thousand Ems on the string,\nbut they are Always his Dupes. If you are a Printer, Do not Be a\nBlacksmith, or you will get Fired.\n\n\n\n                          \u2019Tis sad--there\u2019s an\n                             end to all good\n                                 things.\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n\n\nOther Field Books.\n\n                                   \u2766\n\n\n  Eugene Field Book                           $0.60\n  Field--DeKoven Song Book                     2.00\n  Holy Cross and Other Tales                   1.25\n  House, The                                   1.25\n  Little Book of Profitable Tales              1.25\n  Little Book of Western Verse                 1.25\n  Love Affairs of Bibliomaniac                 1.25\n  Love-songs of Childhood                      1.00\n  Lullaby-land                                 1.50\n  Second Book of Tales                         1.25\n  Second Book of Verse                         1.25\n  Sketch of Field, by Francis Wilson           1.25\n  Songs and Other Verse                        1.25\n  Songs of Childhood                           1.00\n  With Trumpet and Drum                        1.00\n  Life and Letters.

His\ncharacters introduce themselves as old friends, who try to surprise us\nby thinly disguised voices, by the change of a beard, or the innocent\nassumption of ignorance of our identity. The people concerning whom Mr.\nFuller writes in these chronicles, he would have us believe dwell in\nMaine. But I knew them in Illinois; you have them in New York; they are\nyour neighbors in California. We recognize them as old friends. Some\nbusy years have separated us; a multitude of cares have swarmed into\nour lives and driven them out of our thought, and grateful are we that\nthis apostle of humor suddenly turns the limelight of his humor upon\nthe stage of this old work-a-day world of ours, revealing the little\ngroup of actors to our gaze saying, \u201cDid you ever see these people\nbefore?\u201d And our ready, happy looks of glad and instant recognition\ncontradict our \u201cNo we never did\u201d that goes with the extended hand of\nwelcome greeting. Into his book, Mr. Fuller has put the laughter of our\nown lives. Our highest and most grateful appreciation of what he has\ndone, will be to take the laughter of his book into our own hearts.\n\n                                                   ROBERT J.
