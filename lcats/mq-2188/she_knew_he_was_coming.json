    "body": "Outside, the bluish sun slanted low across the green dust of the Martian\ndesert, its last rays sparkling on the far mountain tops. One by one,\nlights flickered on in the city.\n\n\"Mary must be expecting that Earthman,\" Anne said. She held her glastic\nblouse tight together over her breasts and leaned a little out of the\nwindow.\n\nMilly nodded. \"The _Azmuth_ landed this morning.\"\n\nThe noises of commerce were fading. From the window Anne saw the neon\nblaze up over the door. For the thousandth time she blinked between the\nequivocal words: 30--BEAUTIFUL HOSTESSES--30. Laughter, dry and false,\nfiltered up from the tea bars along the street. She looked westward,\ntoward the spaceport, and made out the shadowy nose of the berthed space\nliner looming against the night. She could picture the scene--a thousand\nstevedores unloading cargo, refill men and native spacewriters scurrying\nover the sleek hull, the Earth voyageurs shouting orders and curses.\n\n\"Maybe he isn't even on it.\" Anne turned from the window. She crossed to\nthe couch and sat down, fluffing out the green crinkly glass of her\nskirt; pendant, multicolored birds flashed from the rings in her ears.\nShe tucked rosy feet under her scented body. \"I don't like Earthmen,\"\nshe said.\n\n\"They spend money.\"\n\n\"They make me sick,\" Anne said. \"With their pale skins and ugly eyes and\nhairy bodies.\"\n\n\"They have strong arms.\"\n\nAnne's wide, red mouth curled in distaste. \"They're like a bunch of\nkids.\"\n\nThe room was lighted by soft, overhead fire. Heavy drapes hung from the\nwalls. Sweet, spicy incense curled bluely from the burners by the\nwindow.\n\nBefore the mirror, Milly edged in the narrow line of her pink eyebrows\nwith a pencil. She folded her lips in, rubbing them together, licked\nthem, making them a glistening red. She pinched her cheeks.\n\n\"I wonder when they'll catch Crescent?\" she said.\n\nAnne yawned languorously. \"It won't be long.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't want to be in her shoes,\" Milly said.\n\nAnne patted her mouth lazily. \"She ought to have known she couldn't run\naway.\"\n\n\"What do you think Miss Bestris will do to her?\"\n\nAnne stood up, brushing out the wrinkles in her dress. \"I should care.\"\n\n\"But what will she do?\"\n\nAnne shrugged. \"Whip her, maybe. How should _I_ know?\"\n\n\"Don't you feel you'd like to run away, once in a while?\" Milly asked,\nturning to look at the other girl.\n\nAnne laughed coldly. \"I've got better sense.\"\n\n\"But don't you _want_ to?\"\n\nAnne tossed her purple hair. \"Where is there to go? Who is there to go\nto?\"\n\n\"Yes.... I guess you're right.\" Milly turned back to her reflection.\n\n_Buzzzzzz_....\n\nBoth girls turned their heads to the buttons on the wall. The white one\nwas glowing.\n\n\"It's Miss Bestris.\"\n\n\"We'd better go,\" Milly said.\n\nTogether they walked down the heavily carpeted stairs to the sitting\nroom.\n\nThe Madame was waiting. She was a large woman, rolling in creases of\nfat, and her pink hair was rough and clipped short. She had a pair of\ndimples in her cheeks and a single gold band around her right wrist. She\nwas leaning against the piano.\n\n\"Hurry now, girls, hurry right along,\" she said.\n\nMore girls were entering the room; they spread out, sitting on the\nchairs, curling at the Madame's feet. Their eyes--amethyst, gray or\ngolden--were on her face. Many had pink hair, others had tresses of\npurple or salmon.\n\n\"Now, girls, I suppose you know there's an Earth ship in port?\"\n\nThe girls nodded.\n\n\"So I expect we'll have visitors tonight. I want you to all look your\nvery best.\" She smiled at them. \"Anne, why don't you wear that low-cut,\norange plastic with the spangles, and June, you the prim white one? You\nlook like an angel in it.\" June smiled. \"And Mary...?\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss Bestris?\"\n\n\"Mary. Did you buy that neo-nylon I told you about?\"\n\n\"No, Miss Bestris.\"\n\n\"Mary, Mary, Mary. I just don't understand you at all.\"\n\n\"I'm saving my money, Miss Bestris,\" Mary said intently.\n\n\"Yes, dear, I know that. We're _all_ saving our money. But we simply\nmust look presentable. We have a reputation to hold up.\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss Bestris.\"\n\n\"Then, Mary, dear, do--do, _please_, buy yourself something decent.\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss Bestris. I will.... Tomorrow. Tomorrow morning, if I ...\"\n\n\"Child? If you what?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Miss Bestris.\"\n\n\"Well. See that you get it tomorrow. If you don't, I'm afraid I'll have\nto take some of your money and get it for you.\"\n\nMary looked down at the floor. The flaming glow of the hydrojet torches\ncast golden lights in her softly purple hair.\n\n\"By the way, Mary. Is that your cake in the oven?\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss Bestris.\"\n\nThe other girls snickered.\n\n\"Let her alone,\" said the Madame. \"If she wants to bake a cake, why\nshouldn't she?\"\n\nNo one answered.\n\nMiss Bestris went on around the room, discussing the girls' clothing,\nbrushing this girl's hair, pinching that girl's cheek, chucking this one\nunder the chin, smiling, frowning. Then finally she stepped back and\nnodded.\n\n\"You all look quite good, I think. I can be proud of you. And now, I\nwant you all to go to your rooms and make them extra attractive, and\nthen try to get a little rest, so you'll all be especially beautiful\nwhen the boys come. Run along now.\"\n\nThe girls filed out, and night continued to settle. After a while, her\ncigarette glowing in the gloom, the Madame waddled to her office. There\nthree people were waiting for her.\n\n\n\nThe office was plain, businesslike, masculine; no lace, no ribbons, no\nperfume, only the crisp smell of new paper, the tangy odor of ink, the\nsweet smell of eraser fluid. When she came in the door the three people\nstood up.\n\nShe waved her cigarette hand with a once delicate gesture and flame\nlight glinted dully on the gold band. \"Please don't get up for me,\" she\nsaid, but her tone was condescending and the three visitors sat down\nrespectfully.\n\nMiss Bestris crossed to her desk; she perched on a corner of it, leaned\nback, blew smoke.\n\n\"You wanted to see me about your girls?\"\n\nTwo of the people, man and wife, looked at each other. \"Yes,\" they said.\nAnd the other man said, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Did you bring any pictures?\"\n\nThey handed her pictures, and she held them up to the overhead torch.\nShe studied them critically, pursing and unpursing her lips in secret\ncalculation.\n\n\"This one,\" she said finally, holding out one of the pictures.\n\nThe man and wife rustled their clothing; they smiled faintly proud at\neach other.\n\nThe other man got up slowly, retrieved his picture, left the room\nwithout saying a word.\n\n\"We can't do for little Lavada,\" the woman whined. \"She was a late\nchild, and we're getting old, and we thought she would be better here.\nIt's hard to do for a growing girl when you get old. And my husband\ncan't keep steady work, because of his health and ...\"\n\n\"I'm sure she will be happy here,\" the Madame said, smiling.\n\n\"Yes,\" the man agreed. \"It's for the best. But--you know--well, we hate\nto do it.\"\n\n\"How old is she?\"\n\n\"... Fourteen.\"\n\nMiss Bestris studied the picture again. \"She doesn't look over twelve.\"\n\n\"She's fourteen.\"\n\n\"And healthy--\"\n\n\"We have doctors to see to that,\" the Madame said. \"How much did you\nhave in mind?\"\n\n\"Well,\" the man said, \"it's been a month now since I worked, and with\ndebts and everything....\"\n\n\"And something to put aside for winter,\" his wife added.\n\n\"We couldn't take less than a _milli dordoc_.\"\n\n\"And we wouldn't even think of it, but we don't have a scrap of bread in\nthe house.\"\n\n\"And all our bills, and winter coming on....\"\n\nMiss Bestris turned the picture this way and that. The parents waited.\nThe woman cleared her throat. The man shuffled his feet. The clock on\nthe wall went tick-tick, tick-tick.\n\n\"I'll give you eight hundred and thirty _dordocs_,\" the Madame said.\n\n\"Well....\"\n\nMiss Bestris bent forward, holding out the picture. \"Here, then. Take\nit. I wouldn't offer that, but I need a girl right now. One of mine ran\naway last week, and I'm afraid she won't be able to work for a month or\nso after they bring her back. I'm being generous. Eight hundred and\nthirty, or take your picture and don't waste my time.\"\n\nThe man and woman stared at her. And the clock went _tick-tick_.\n\n\"Take it, Chav.\"\n\n\"... All right,\" the man said. \"We need the money.\"\n\nMiss Bestris leaned across the desk, pressed a button on her panel.\nAlmost immediately, a door slid silently open and her lawyer entered\nwith a white, printed, standard-form sales contract in his hand.\nEfficiently and rapidly, he entered the particulars. \"Sign here,\" he\nsaid, and the parents signed.\n\n\"Now,\" said the Madame, \"if you'll bring in Lavada tomorrow at nine,\nI'll arrange for a doctor to be here. If his examination is\nsatisfactory, the money will be ready.\"\n\nThe lawyer left, and the woman said, \"You understand, we wouldn't do\nthis but for ...\"\n\n\"I understand, perfectly,\" Miss Bestris said. \"You don't need to worry.\nThis is the best kind of house--Earthmen only, you know, and they're\nvery particular. My girls are given the best of care. I'm like a mother\nto them, and if they are thrifty and diligent, they'll be able to save\nenough money in a--a very short time to redeem their contract as\nprovided by law. You needn't worry at all.\"\n\n\"Well,\" the woman said, \"I feel better after talking to you. I feel\nbetter about the whole thing to hear you talk like that.\"\n\nThe clock went _tick-tick_.\n\n\"Uh,\" the man said, \"you won't--? That is, our little daughter is\nsometimes wilful and ... uh ... well ... Sometimes.\"\n\nMiss Bestris smiled. \"We know how to handle girls.\"\n\n\"You'll treat her...?\"\n\n\"As I would my own child,\" Miss Bestris said; she took out another\ncigarette, lit it. \"I think we'll call her--well--Poppy. Earthmen like\nto feel at home, you know.\"\n\nThe clock went _tick-tick_.\n\n\"Well, uh,\" the man said. \"Uh. Thank you.\"\n\n\n\nIn one of the rooms upstairs Mary sat before the dressing table with her\nback to the mirror, while June and Adele occupied the two overstuffed\nchairs. Night sounds drifted up from the yellow canal, and fresh flower\nscents whispered on the warm air. The diaphanous glass curtains rustled\nat the open window.\n\n\"They're too expensive,\" Mary said. \"I'm sure Miss Bestris overcharges\nus for them.\"\n\n\"Hush,\" said June, glancing around at the walls nervously. \"Hush, Mary.\"\nShe smoothed at the delicate, plutolac lace fringe above her breasts.\n\"Imported material like this costs money. You can't get it for nothing,\nand we have to have the best.\"\n\n\"I still think she charges too much.\"\n\nAdele shrugged delicately and crossed shapely ankles. \"I think Miss\nBestris must like you, or she wouldn't let you wear that dress again\ntonight. You ought to watch out that you don't get on the wrong side of\nher.\"\n\nMary laughed, her amethyst eyes sparkling. \"I won't care. Not after\ntonight.\"\n\n\"You're not going to run away?\" June asked breathlessly. \"You wouldn't\ndare do that. You'd catch it, sure!\"\n\nMary shook her head. \"Not _run_ away.\"\n\nAdele leaned forward and said huskily, \"You got enough money to redeem\nyour contract?\"\n\nAgain Mary shook her head. \"No. It's nine hundred and ten _dordocs_. I\nhave only ninety-three. But I'll have enough in the morning!\" She stood\nup and crossed to the window, looked out toward the spaceport.\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Tell us, Mary!\"\n\n\"Tell you what?\" Anne asked, coming into the room. Languidly she drew\nthe door closed behind her and rested against it. \"Tell you what?\" she\ninsisted, narrowing milky eyes.\n\n\"Mary says she can redeem her contract tomorrow.\"\n\nAnne's wide mouth curled contemptuously. \"Nonsense!\"\n\n\"It's not,\" said Mary without turning.\n\nAnne glided sensuously across the room to the bed, her tight fitting\nplastic rippling with her tigerish muscles. She sat down.\n\n\"He said he'd take me away, this trip,\" Mary continued. \"He'll sign off,\nand then we'll both get a ship and go to one of the frontier planets.\nWhere it won't matter about--all this.\"\n\nAnne laughed harshly. \"My God! You believe _that_?\"\n\n\"We've both been saving our money,\" Mary said dreamily. \"He's in love\nwith me. He said so.\"\n\n\"Honey, that's what they all say.\"\n\nSmiling, Mary turned from the window and leaned backward, stretching.\n\"You don't know him. He's different.\"\n\n\"They're all the same,\" Anne said, her mouth twisting bitterly.\n\"They're just alike. Don't believe any of them.\"\n\nAnd Mary said, \"With him, it's different. You'll see.\"\n\nAfter a moment, Anne said, \"That Earthman? That what's-his-name?\" Mary\nnodded, and Anne brushed an imaginary something off her knee. \"An\nEarthman,\" Anne said. \"They're the worst of all.\"\n\n\"You don't know him, or you wouldn't say that.\"\n\nAdele looked away from Anne. \"You love him, don't you, Mary?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You're a fool,\" Anne said. \"Listen to me. _Love_ a man? God! You'll\nsee. After him, there'll be another and another, and--just like\nRosy--you'll watch 'em leave you and laugh at you until finally you're\nhurt so bad you don't think you can stand being hurt any more, and then\nalong comes another one, and it starts all over again, and then one\nnight you take a razor blade and go to the sink and stick out your\nthroat and....\"\n\n\"No! No! You're wrong! He's not like the rest!\"\n\nAnne leaned back carelessly, resting, propped on one hand. \"See. You\nknow I'm right, already.\"\n\n\"You're not!\"\n\nAnne shrugged. \"Honey, tell me that tomorrow night.\"\n\n\"I better go take my cake out,\" Mary said. She fled the room in a swirl\nof shimmering glastic.\n\nAnne sneered, \"I don't see why Miss Bestris puts up with her the way she\ndoes.\"\n\n\"You're jealous,\" June said quietly.\n\nAnne did not answer.\n\n\"Mary's decent,\" Adele said. \"Maybe that's why. She's from the sticks,\nand her parents still come to see her on visiting days, and there's\nsomething about her so--so innocent. Maybe that's why Miss Bestris likes\nher.\"\n\nJune said, \"I think she's better than the rest of us. I think Miss\nBestris feels sorry for her in a way.\"\n\n\"Don't make me laugh,\" Anne said, facing June. \"The only one that'll\never feel sorry for her is herself!\"\n\n\"You shouldn't have talked like that to her!\" June snapped. \"Why don't\nyou let her alone? She'll feel bad enough without you helping!\"\n\nAnne rolled over on the bed and stared up at the ceiling. June took a\nhelox lamp from her drawer and started to bake her hair darker. Those\nEarthmen were so funny about colors.\n\nIn the kitchen, Mary took the cake out of the oven. It was steamy and\nlight and fluffy, and it smelled sweet and warm. She set it on the table\nand mixed a two-minute green frosting which she spread, carefully, over\nthe cake. She patted here and there with the spatula and stood back, her\neyes proud and serious.\n\nShe hummed a little tune under her breath as she scrubbed the pots and\npans. Her hands moved in practiced rhythm, and the water splashed and\ngurgled. When the kitchen was again spotless, she looked once more at\nthe cake, and then, turning out the light, she went back to her room.\n\nAnne and Adele had left, but June was sitting quietly in the dusky\nmoonlight. Her white dress seemed vaguely luminous.\n\nLaughing, Mary flicked on the light.\n\n\"It's a wonderful cake,\" she said. \"The best one I ever made. Just the\nway it should be.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't feel too bad, Mary, if he doesn't come to eat it,\" June\nsaid. \"I don't want to sound like Anne, but there was a lot of sense in\nwhat she said.\"\n\n\"It's just like a real wedding cake.\" She hummed the snatch of Martian\ntune. \"Like in the tele-papers.\" She laughed with her eyes. \"The\nbridegroom takes the silver knife and cuts two large pieces of the cake\nwhile the bride, dressed in filament coral, stands at his right hand.\nShe carries a bouquet of--Anne just likes to be mean!\"\n\nJune frowned. Mary crossed to the dressing table. She studied her face\nin the mirror. It was heart shaped, elfin; her purple hair was a riot of\ncurls, and her eyes were amethyst and gold. She smiled at herself. \"I\nwant to look as pretty as I can tonight.\" She twisted around. \"You don't\nthink he'll come either, do you?\"\n\n\"I--no, Mary.\"\n\nMary looked back at the mirror. \"He likes our canal blossom perfume.\"\nShe dabbed some of it on her ear lobes. \"I like it best, too.\"\n\nJune stood up, crossed to the musikon, found a slow five-toned waltz.\nShe turned the music very low, and left the color mixer dim enough so\nthat only the faintest ghosts projected hues moved on walls and ceiling.\n\nMary continued to stare into the mirror. \"But he will come. I know it.\"\n\nJune said nothing.\n\n\"Don't you see. I just _know_ he'll come.\"\n\nJune crossed back to her seat.\n\nMary turned from the mirror. \"I'm sure he will. He's--I mean....\"\n\nJune smiled wanly.\n\n\"Well, he will! You'll see!\"\n\nJune said, \"Even if it is an old dress, you look very nice in it.\"\n\n\"I've been learning his language. I can say 'thank you' and 'yes' and\n'no' and 'I love you' and all kinds of things in it. He gave me a book,\nand I've been studying. I want to be able really to talk with him. We've\ngot a lot to talk about. I want to find out about his parents, and what\nhe likes for supper and what kind of music he likes to hear, and--and\nall sorts of things. I want to find out all about his planet, and....\"\n\n\"Yes,\" June said wearily, \"I know.\"\n\nThe music played on. The moving lights on the walls were like colored\nreflections from a sunlit river.\n\n\"He may be a little late tonight; he has a lot to do, first. But he'll\nbe here.\"\n\n_Buzzzzz_....\n\nIt was the red button; it blinked on and off.\n\n\"Visitors,\" June said.\n\n\"Look--\" Mary said. \"Look, June. I'm not half ready yet. Look. Tell Miss\nBestris I'll be down a little late. Tell her I have a special boy, and\nit'll be all right. He wants me to wait for him.\"\n\nJune was on her feet. \"... All right. You'd better not wait too long!\"\n\n\"I won't.\"\n\nAfter June was gone, Mary returned to the task of making her face\npretty, but after a moment, she turned from the mirror, leaned back, and\ntried to relax. Underneath her dress, her heart was pounding.\n\nThe warm air carried sounds of the night creatures. One of the great\ncanal insects, screeching, flapped by the window. The tiny third moon\ncrept up over the horizon, and the buildings cast triple shadows.\n\n_Buzzz. Buzzzz._\n\nStill Mary waited.\n\n_Buzzz. Buzzzz. Buzzzzzz...._\n\nShe was afraid to wait any longer. But by now she was sure that he would\nbe down stairs.\n\nThere was a last-minute flurry of combing and primping, and then she\nrustled out of the room, her head erect, her eyes shining.\n\n\n\nThe large reception room was filling. Overhead, the color organ threw\nshimmering, prismatic beams on the ceiling. Beneath it, stiff,\nembarrassed spacemen, mostly officers dressed in parade uniforms,\nchatted in space-pidgin with the laughing, rainbow-haired girls.\n\nMiss Bestris sat in one corner, her eyes roving the room: settling here\nfor a second, there for a second, checking, approving, disapproving,\nsilently. Occasionally she would smile or nod at one of the girls or one\nof the spacemen, and once she frowned ever so slightly and shook her\nhead.\n\nAnne was reclining on a couch, eating a golden Martian apple, listening\nto a second mate; she played with a lock of his hair and smiled her wide\nsmile.\n\nJune, angelic, sat primly in a straight-backed chair, the captain at her\nfeet, a boyish, space-pale Earthman, drew embarrassed circles on the\ncarpet with his index finger.\n\nIn the next room, three couples were dancing to the slow music of an\nEarth orchestra.\n\nAn inner door opened, and a uniformed native sheriff stepped in, a\ncrisp, military figure. \"Miss Bestris?\"\n\nShe stood up. \"Yes?\"\n\nThe Earthmen fell silent, waiting.\n\n\"We think we have your runaway.\" He turned to the door. \"Bring her in.\"\n\nTwo more sheriffs entered, and between them, there was a young, slender\ngirl. Her face was gaunt and tear-stained. Her body trembled. She looked\nat the Madame fearfully.\n\n\"You idiots!\" Miss Bestris screamed. \"Get her out of here! You'll ruin\nmy party! Take her out!\"\n\nThe two men removed the girl. To the remaining sheriff, Miss Bestris\nsaid, \"Damn you, if you ever do anything like that again, I'll ...\nI'll....\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Madame. But we wanted immediate identification. Would you\nwant us to hold the wrong girl?\"\n\n\"That's her, all right! Now, get out! Wait for me in my office.\"\n\nWhen they were gone Miss Bestris turned to the silent room. In quite\npassable Esperanto she said, \"I--am sorry. A misunderstanding. I assure\nyou, nothing. Go on with the party, and I'll see what I can do for the\npoor girl.\"\n\nShe stood up and in her own language said, \"Lively, girls! Smile! You,\nRita, hurry and serve tea!\"\n\nShe made her exit.\n\nThe spacemen grumbled among themselves, coughed uneasily, watched the\nclosed door through which the Madame had gone. Listening, they could\nhear only a muted mumble of sing-song sounds in several voices.\n\nWith determined animation, the girls moved about, smiled, chatted.\n\nRita came in, wheeling the tea tray, and the girls converged on it, each\ntrying to be the first to serve her escort. The tea was the Martian\nstuff, concocted of a kind of local hemp. The Earthmen found it harsh\nand bitter to the taste, but gentle on the soul.\n\nAnne had filled two cups and returned to the second mate when she caught\nsight of Mary coming down the stairs.\n\nOn the lowest step, Mary stood for a long time; her eyes eagerly\nsearched the crowd. Slowly a puzzled, hurt look came over her face.\n\nJune came to her side after a little while.\n\n\"Isn't he here?\"\n\n\"No. Not yet.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" June said, touching Mary's arm lightly.\n\n\"It's all right. It's early yet. I'll just sit down by Miss Bestris'\nchair and wait for him.\"\n\nShe turned from June and went to the chair. Before she could sit down, a\nspace corporal came over, bowed, tried to take her hand. She shook her\nhead. He smiled twistedly and walked stiffly away.\n\nAnother man smiled at her. She shook her head slowly.\n\nSomeone came in the front door, and she leaned forward. Then she slumped\nback limply.\n\nShe heard a tinkly laugh. She looked in its direction. She met Anne's\neyes, bright and amused. Just then Miss Bestris came in, her eyes angry\nand her cheeks flushed. She strode across the room.\n\n\"Well,\" she said. \"I'm glad to see you finally came down.\" She sank\nheavily into her chair. \"Cresent's back. They just brought her in. The\nidiots came right in here with her. I'll bet I lost half-a-dozen\ncustomers. These Earthmen are sensitive about such things.\"\n\nMary was still staring at the door; Miss Bestris looked down at her.\n\n\"Well, what are you sitting here for?\"\n\n\"Please, Miss Bestris. I'm waiting for my special boy friend tonight.\"\n\nShe snorted and looked away. \"Why isn't he here?\"\n\n\"He will be.\"\n\n\"He'd better. I'll let you wait another--half an hour. That's all.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Bestris. You're very kind to me.\"\n\n\"I indulge you more than I ought to, child,\" she said. \"More than is\ngood for you, if the truth were known.\"\n\nA man came in; Mary stiffened and then relaxed.\n\nThe mutter of voices blended into a steady hum. More couples were\ndancing. Miss Bestris moved around the room. The music was tinny.\n\nAnother man came in.\n\n\"Your time's up,\" the Madame told Mary.\n\n\"Please, let me just wait for another few minutes.\"\n\nMiss Bestris fixed her lips grimly. \"I've had enough nonsense for\ntonight. You heard me!\"\n\n\"_Please!_\"\n\n\"You heard what I said.\"\n\n\"Miss Bestris, I couldn't. Not tonight. Honest, I couldn't. If I had to\ntalk to anybody, I'd break down and cry. He'll ... come. I know he\nwill.\"\n\nMiss Bestris whirled on her. \"Listen, you little--\" But she stopped,\nsuddenly. \"All right,\" she said, gritting her teeth. \"I can't afford\nanother scene tonight. But you'll be sorry for this.\"\n\nMiss Bestris stormily looked away. The dancers danced; the music swelled\nlouder. Gradually, deliberately, the lights were waning.\n\n\"Haven't I always been good to you, Mary?\" the Madame asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then like an obedient girl, do as I say. If he hasn't come by now, he\njust won't. He's gone to some other house.\"\n\n\"No!\" Mary said doggedly.\n\n\"Just remember, tomorrow, how you deliberately disobeyed me. Your silly\nemotions are costing me money, and that's one thing I simply won't stand\nfor.\"\n\n\"He'll come.\" Mary said. \"You won't lose money.\"\n\nCouples sat side by side, laughing, talking in whispers. Occasionally\nthere were giggles. The room began to empty slowly.\n\nThe lights continued to dim until the rooms were gloomy. Even the\nshifting shades of the color organ were no more than a faint ambience.\nAnne, laughing, helped her second mate to his feet.\n\n\"I'll give you one more chance,\" Miss Bestris said. \"The next man that\ncomes in....\"\n\n\"No! I just couldn't! Not tonight!\"\n\nA few more customers drifted in. Then even the stragglers stopped\ncoming. It was very late.\n\n\"He's deserted you; you see that now?\" Madame Bestris sneered.\n\nMary stood up. There were tears in her eyes. \"You can't--you\ndon't--know--how I feel,\" she choked. \"You don't care!\" She turned and\nran up the stairs, crying.\n\nSeveral Earthmen, still in the big room, turned to watch. The torches\nwere misty twinkles now. The last couples climbed the stairs and then\nMiss Bestris, too, went to bed.\n\n\n\nThe blue morning came. The town awoke; commerce began.\n\nAt seven, Miss Bestris lay in bed frowning, considering the events of\nthe previous evening. But she was not so annoyed that she forgot to call\na doctor on the teleview and arrange for him to come at nine to give a\nphysical examination.\n\nHer bulk out of bed, she dressed and went to the kitchen to brew a pot\nof hemp tea. The cleaning maid, moving about in the next room, heard\nMiss Bestris call sharply: \"Flavia! Come in here!\"\n\nFlavia appeared with a dust rag in her hand.\n\n\"Did you cut this cake?\"\n\n\"No, ma'am.\"\n\nMiss Bestris glowered. \"That little idiot! She must have slipped down\nhere after we were all asleep and sat here and cried her silly little\neyes out! If she thinks she can pull that love-sick act on me she'll\nsoon find out different. Am I supposed to put up with having her moon\nover every space tramp that comes in? Why, I've taken more from her--!\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\nMiss Bestris waddled to the stairs, climbed them determinedly. At Mary's\ndoor she stopped and twisted the knob. Locked!\n\nMiss Bestris hammered. \"Open up, Mary!\" The door rattled under her hand.\n\"Open that door at once!\"\n\nNo answer.\n\nMiss Bestris pounded harder. \"Open up, I say!\"\n\nAnne sauntered into the hall, her dressing gown swishing. \"She really\nmade you look the fool last night, didn't she?\" Anne said lazily.\n\n\"You--you slut! Mind your own business.\"\n\nAnne smiled and shrugged.\n\n\"Open the door, Mary! Do you hear me! Open it!\"\n\n\"Maybe she killed herself,\" Anne said. \"It has happened.\"\n\n\"My God! No.... She wouldn't dare. You think she would?\"\n\nAnne shrugged again. \"They do funny things sometimes.\"\n\nMiss Bestris' face was red. \"Run down and get my keys. In my desk. You\nknow where they are.\"\n\nThen, \"_For God's sake, hurry!_\"\n\nWhile she waited Miss Bestris rattled the door, pleading and cursing.\n\nFinally Anne returned. Miss Bestris snatched the key with a shaking\nhand. She hurled the door open and burst inside.\n\n\"See here, you little--!\" She stopped.\n\nThe room was empty.\n\nOn the neatly made bed reposed a little stack of money. When Miss\nBestris got around to counting it, she found that it contained exactly\nnine hundred and ten _dordocs_.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nObvious punctuation errors repaired.\n\nPage 39 word \"lambence\" changed to \"ambience\" (no more than a faint\nambience) meaning a faint light.",
