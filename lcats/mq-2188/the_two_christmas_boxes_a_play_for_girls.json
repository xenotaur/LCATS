JENKINS       President of the Ladies\u2019 Aid\n    MRS. HODGES           Member of the Ladies\u2019 Aid\n    MRS. BANKS            Member of the Ladies\u2019 Aid\n    MRS. WINTER           Member of the Ladies\u2019 Aid\n    MISS LOOMIS           Member of the Ladies\u2019 Aid\n    MRS. DAVID BROWN          Missionary in Montana\n    DOROTHY BROWN            Daughter of Mrs. Brown\n    MILDRED BANKS            Daughter of Mrs. Banks\n    MRS. WORTHINGTON    Sister-in-law of Mrs. Banks\n    GLADYS             Daughter of Mrs. Worthington\n    MARIE                                    A Maid\n\nThe members of the Aid Society wear plain, rather old-fashioned street\ndresses, with the exception of Miss Loomis, whose dress should be so\nold-fashioned as to be amusing. In the first scene Mrs. Banks wears a\nplain house dress with white apron. Mrs. David Brown should be dressed\nneatly but plainly, and Dorothy wears shirtwaist and skirt. Mrs.\nWorthington should appear in an elaborate negligee, and Gladys in a\npretty house dress, while Marie wears black dress, white apron and cap.\nMildred wears sweater, cap and dark skirt. Beneath the sweater is worn\na middy blouse.\n\nThe first and last scenes take place in Mrs. Banks\u2019 sitting room. A\nfew chairs, a bookcase, pictures and table will be required, also two\nwooden boxes, exactly alike.\n\nIn the second scene a poorly furnished kitchen or living room is\nrepresented. Plain wood chairs should be used, while a red cover should\nbe upon the table. Mrs. Brown should have a large mending basket beside\nher. The Christmas box should be in the foreground.\n\nThe third scene should represent the living room of an apartment, and\nshould be as handsomely furnished as possible. The Christmas box should\nbe at the side of the room, but before unpacking, should be drawn into\nthe foreground.\n\n\n\n\nThe Two Christmas Boxes.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE I.\n\n\n(_Mrs. Banks enters carrying large pile of clothing, which she deposits\nupon a chair._)\n\n_Mrs. Banks._ Dear me, that was heavy! Now for the newspapers.\n\n(_Exit and returns with newspapers which she places on a table near the\npile of clothing._)\n\n_Mrs. B._ Now I have twine all ready and scissors, and everything but\nthe folks to do the work. It\u2019s the same way in every church. A few are\nwilling to do all the work and the rest are all willing to have them.\nThere comes Martha Jenkins now!\n\n(_Hurriedly straightens sofa cushion, changes position of chairs,\nsmoothes hair._)\n\n(_Enter Mrs. Jenkins._)\n\n_Mrs. B._ (_effusively_). Well, Martha, I am glad to see you! I began\nto think that not a soul was coming to help me pack the missionary box.\nTake off your things!\n\n_Mrs. Jenkins._ Thank you. (_Removes hat, gloves and coat._)\n\n_Mrs. B._ What a pretty waist! Did you buy it ready made?\n\n_Mrs. J._ New! No indeed! I made that out of last year\u2019s and the one\nbefore that pieced together. John has read an article about how you can\nmake nice dresses out of stuff you have in the rag bag, so he says I\u2019m\njust as smart as the woman that wrote that article, and he wanted me to\ntry it. (_sits_).\n\n_Mrs. Banks._ Well, William did say something about that to me, so I\nsuppose he read the same article, so I said all right, but I\u2019d have to\neconomize on him too. I\u2019d cut off the tops of his socks for wristlets\nfor cold weather, and I\u2019d make neckties out of Mildred\u2019s hairbows for\nhim, and I\u2019d try to make over his old frock coat into a sack coat to\nwear to the store on week days, so that silenced him all right!\n\n_Mrs. Jenkins._ There\u2019s really no reason for economy being an\nexclusively feminine virtue.\n\n_Mrs. B._ (_Taking up several of the articles from the pile of\nclothing_). These things look as if somebody had been economizing all\nright.\n\n_Mrs. J._ (_placing newspaper carefully in the bottom of the box_).\nSuppose we get busy now and pack the box.\n\n_Mrs. B._ (_doubtfully_). I don\u2019t believe any of the others are coming.\n\n_Mrs. J._ Emmeline Miller told me she couldn\u2019t come on account of\ndomestic affliction.\n\n_Mrs. B._ (_surprised_). How terrible! What was it?\n\n_Mrs. J._ Her husband\u2019s mother and two aunts have come to spend a week,\nand Emmeline said if that wasn\u2019t domestic affliction she didn\u2019t know\nwhat was!\n\n_Mrs. B._ Well we can soon get the box packed. Here\u2019s a nice overcoat!\n(_Holds it up._)\n\n_Mrs. J._ Marcia Hill sent that. The sleeves are a bit raggedy and the\nlining is torn quite badly but the missionary\u2019s wife can fix it. They\nsay that\u2019s one of the qualifications of a missionary\u2019s wife to be able\nto do anything.\n\n_Mrs. B._ I\u2019ll fold it and wrap it and you can put it in the box.\n(_folds coat, wraps in paper. Hands to Mrs. Jenkins who places it in\nthe box_).\n\n_Mrs. B._ I\u2019m going to give this white shawl. (_Holds up shawl._) It\nreally ought to be cleaned or washed but I simply haven\u2019t the time. You\nknow how busy everyone is just before Christmas.\n\n_Mrs. J._ O that can easily be cleaned in cornmeal or flour or\ngasoline, I forget which, (_aside_). I should think she\u2019d be ashamed to\nsend it!\n\n_Mrs. B._ (_wrapping shawl_). I know that the missionaries lead much\nsimpler lives than we do so of course they have more time.\n\n_Mrs. J._ Hand it to me and I\u2019ll put it beside the overcoat.\n\n_Mrs. B._ Mrs. Hodges sent this dress of Clara\u2019s. (_Holds up dress._)\n\n_Mrs. J._ It\u2019s rather fadey looking but there\u2019s a lot of wear in it yet.\n\n_Mrs. B._ There\u2019s a guimpe that goes with it, but when I asked Clara\nfor it, she said her mother said the guimpe was too good to give away.\n\n_Mrs. J._ (_examining dress_). It isn\u2019t a bad quality gingham and it\ncould easily be boiled out and used for a white dress. Wrap it up and\nhand it over, (_aside_). If she is going to hold a farewell service\nover every last thing that goes in the box, we\u2019ll never get it packed.\n\n_Mrs. B._ Here\u2019s Emmeline Miller\u2019s red dress! (_holding up shabby\ndress._)\n\n_Mrs. J._ (_surprised_). O that dress! I don\u2019t see how she ever brought\nherself to part with it for she has worn it years and years!\n\n_Mrs. B._ The material isn\u2019t so bad and it can be scoured, and scrubbed\nand pressed and mended and it will look quite respectable. (_Wraps\ndress and hands to Mrs. J._) I\u2019m going to give this suit of Albert\u2019s.\nAlbert simply insists that he will not wear it another day, and so I\nthought it would do very well for the missionary\u2019s son. (_Holds up\npatched and worn suit._)\n\n_Mrs. J._ Well, I\u2019m sure the missionary\u2019s son will be very thankful to\nget it. (_Places suit in box._)\n\n_Mrs. B._ I\u2019m going to give these ties too. (_holds up gaudy ties_).\nTwo or three of them are new but Albert is so fussy he won\u2019t wear them.\nI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve brought him up to be too particular.\n\n_Mrs. J._ I\u2019m afraid you have, Louisa.\n\n_Mrs. B._ (_indignantly_). I don\u2019t know as he is any more fussy than\nanybody else\u2019s boy. I like to see a boy particular about what he wears.\n(_Folds ties and wraps them._)\n\n_Mrs. J._ (_apologetically_). Well, don\u2019t get mad, Louisa. I was just\nagreeing with you. (_aside_). Isn\u2019t she a tinder-box when anybody\nmentions her boy!\n\n_Mrs. B._ Here\u2019s a cape from Mrs. Winter. It\u2019s warm, but you can\u2019t say\nmuch else about it.\n\n_Mrs. J._ Why it will be just the thing for those cold Montana winters.\nI think the missionary\u2019s wife will be glad to get it.\n\n_Mrs. B._ (_examining cape_). You see its some moth-eaten and I was\nscared for fear it would get moths in my house. I never have them.\n\n_Mrs. J._ Well wrap it up quick, and I\u2019ll tuck it in here beside the\nother things. Why we are getting quite a box full. (_Places package in\nbox._)\n\n_Mrs. B._ I thought I would contribute this red wrapper. It\u2019s warm,\neven though it isn\u2019t so good looking. (_Holds up shabby wrapper._)\n\n_Mrs. J._ I\u2019m sure that will be very useful. But what\u2019s that?\n\n_Mrs. B._ Miss Loomis has actually contributed her hat. Isn\u2019t it awful?\n\n_Mrs. J._ (_hesitating_). Really Louisa, we can\u2019t send that! It\u2019s\nterrible!\n\n_Mrs. B._ Miss Loomis would never forgive me if I didn\u2019t. I\u2019d like to\nput it in the ash barrel though. (_Holds up hat._)\n\n_Mrs. J._ Let\u2019s see it! (_examines hat_). Well, I suppose if it were\nsteamed and pressed and dyed and other trimming put on, it wouldn\u2019t be\nso bad. We\u2019ll have to put it in for a finishing touch.\n\n_Mrs. B._ (_handing hat to her_). I am certainly thankful that I will\nnot see that hat in front of me in church any more. Here\u2019s some more\nnewspapers, Martha, to stuff in at the top.\n\n_Mrs. J._ (_completes task by packing top of box firmly with papers._)\n\n_Mrs. J._ Now thank goodness, that\u2019s done. Dear me, it\u2019s five o\u2019clock\nand I must hurry home. I had no idea it was so late.\n\n_Mrs. B._ (_hospitably_). Can\u2019t you stay and have supper with us?\n\n_Mrs. J._ (_rising and pinning on her hat_). O no, thank you just the\nsame.\n\n_Mrs. B._ (_helping her on with coat_). Well thank you very much for\ncoming. I\u2019m glad that _one_ member of the society was conscientious\nenough to help.\n\n_Mrs. J._ (_drawing on gloves_). O I never shirk my duty. Good-bye\nLouisa. Come and see me real soon.\n\n_Mrs. B._ You come and see me. Thank you ever so much for helping me.\n\n_Mrs. J._ Good-bye.\n\n_Mrs. B._ Good-bye, Martha.\n\n_Mrs. B._ (_picking up papers and rearranging room_). I suppose Martha\nthought it would have been absolutely impossible for me to have packed\nthat box by myself. Well, thank goodness it\u2019s done, and Amelia\u2019s box is\ndone, and I\u2019m about done, too. (_Seats herself wearily._)\n\n(_Enter Mildred, swinging skates in one hand._)\n\n_Mildred._ Well, mother, you look about fagged out. (_goes over to her\nmother, and smoothes her forehead_). Is the rummage sale over?\n\n_Mrs. B._ Rummage sale? We were packing the missionary box.\n\n_Mildred._ (_smiling_). I hope the gifts will be appreciated. I wish I\nwere to get Miss Loomis\u2019 hat, and Mrs. Hodges\u2019 dress, and a few other\nadornments.\n\n_Mrs. B._ (_irritably_). Mildred, I am really too tired to stand any\nnonsense. I have your Aunt Amelia\u2019s box all ready, and I\u2019ve worried\nover that, for I know whatever I send will be criticised.\n\n_Mildred._ (_continuing to smooth her mother\u2019s hair_). Well, I don\u2019t\nsee how they could possibly find fault with those presents. Dad is\nalways so liberal about that box, but I know Aunt Amelia always finds\nfaults with every last thing we send. I should think though she would\nbe pleased with the waist I embroidered for her, and those lovely\nhandkerchiefs.\n\n_Mrs. B._ She won\u2019t though.\n\n_Mildred._ It was the limit though for Dad to go shopping on his own\naccount and buy Gladys a dress pattern that I\u2019d have given my eyes for,\nand fur gloves for Uncle and a fur cap for Joe, and an embroidered\ndress pattern for Aunt Amelia too. The saleswoman coaxed him into\ngetting those embroidered dress patterns, all right.\n\n_Mrs. B._ (_irritably_). O your father always has some foolishness\nabout Amelia loving him because he is her youngest brother. But the\nbox is packed anyway, and the expressman is to call in the morning the\nfirst thing. I\u2019ve just got to nail the cover on both boxes and mark\nthem.\n\n_Mildred._ (_eagerly_). O let me do that mother. I\u2019ve been gallivanting\nwith the girls out skating while you\u2019ve been working, and I feel\nashamed of myself. Let me do that little bit. (_coaxingly_).\n\n_Mrs. B._ (_gratefully_). Thank you, dear. I am tired and my head\naches, so I\u2019ll go rest awhile if you will finish up. Thank you ever so\nmuch, (_rises_). Be careful you don\u2019t spill ink.\n\n_Mildred._ (_reassuringly_). O I\u2019ll be careful all right. You go rest.\n\n(_Exit Mrs. Banks._)\n\n_Mildred._ (_cheerfully_). Now for the amateur carpentry! Who says\na girl can\u2019t drive a nail? (_Hums a tune as she nails the lid upon\nfirst box._) There, Mrs. Missionary! Your valuable donations are\nsafe. Let us hope that they may not be injured in transit! Now Aunt\nAmelia, here\u2019s something to complain about! (_takes up cards_). O poor\nmother! She\u2019s forgotten to put the cards on the presents. Well, I\ncan\u2019t unpack the box again, and I\u2019m not going to worry her by telling\nher that she forgot them. Uncle William will know that the sash and\nembroidered dresses aren\u2019t for him. (_nails box_). Now for the marking.\nLet\u2019s see how artistic I can be! Mrs. William Worthington, Morningside\nApartments, 524 W. 118th Street, New York. (_suddenly_). O I wonder if\nthat was the right box? (_hesitates_). O I\u2019m sure it was, I couldn\u2019t\nmake a mistake about anything like that! Now for the other! (_repeats\nas she marks_). Mrs. David Brown, Silver Creek, Montana. Now ladies,\nfor what you are about to receive may you both be truly thankful!\n\n\nCURTAIN.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\n\n\n(_Dorothy dusts room, while Mrs. Brown is seated at table mending._)\n\n_Dorothy._ (_mournfully_). Well, mother, it don\u2019t look much like\nChristmas with father and Rob away. I suppose you are going to\ncelebrate by mending, so I\u2019ll get out that old blue waist and see if I\ncan patch it up to look more respectable. (_Searches in mending basket\nand brings out waist ... Holds it up to view._) It\u2019s pretty hopeless\nthough! (_satirically_). What a merry lively Christmas it will be!\n\n_Mrs. B._ (_cheerfully_). Things might be lots and lots worse,\ndaughter. Since your father had to be away, I\u2019m glad that Rob could\nkeep him company, and we\u2019ll have a postponed Christmas when they come\nback. Thread this needle for me, please. Your eyes are better than\nmine. (_Dorothy threads needle._)\n\n_Dorothy._ (_handing needle to her mother_). A postponed Christmas is\nas cheerful as a warmed over pancake! But let\u2019s open the box instead of\nwaiting for father. He won\u2019t care.\n\n_Mrs. B._ (_hesitatingly_). I had planned to wait till he came back\nbut there may be something perishable in the box.\n\n_Dorothy._ Perishable! Everything perished long before it reached us!\nWait till I get the hammer and chisel to open it.\n\n(_Exit Dorothy._)\n\n_Mrs. B._ (_sadly_). Poor Dorothy! How I would love to have pretty,\ndainty clothes for her and how she would enjoy them.\n\n(_Enter Dorothy with child\u2019s shabby hat on head._)\n\n_Dorothy._ (_smiling_). This is the hat that was sent last year, so do\nyou wonder I am pessimistic about this year\u2019s box? (_Tosses hat into\ncorner_). Well, now for the opening, and I\u2019ll be hopeful anyway.\n\n_Mrs. B._ Look out for your fingers!\n\n_Dorothy._ (_cheerfully_). O I\u2019m a fine amateur carpenter! This lid was\nnailed on to stay, though! (_Removes lid from box._)\n\n_Dorothy._ (_surprised_). Well, I never! Mother, mother, put down that\nold mending and look here! (_Takes mending from her mother._) Did you\never see such a lovely box!\n\n_Mrs. B._ (_also surprised_). What a beautiful box! Is it really meant\nfor us?\n\n_Dorothy._ Here\u2019s the label all right. Mrs. David Brown, and that\u2019s\nyou! Just see the holly! Isn\u2019t it Christmas-y? (_Places sprig of holly\nin her hair._)\n\n_Mrs. B._ (_hesitating_). Hadn\u2019t we better wait till your father and\nRob come?\n\n_Dorothy._ (_reproachfully_). Wait? O mother what outrageous cruelty!\nWhy my fingers just itch to open those packages. There don\u2019t seem to be\nany labels, but we can guess at them. You take the first.\n\n_Mrs. B._ (_takes parcel, unwraps and displays white embroidered\nwaist_). Isn\u2019t that exquisite?\n\n_Dorothy._ (_enthusiastically_). Why, mother, you\u2019ll look as pretty as\na picture in it. Stand up and let\u2019s see how it looks on you. (_Holds up\nwaist upon her mother._)\n\n_Dorothy._ Mother, you just look sweet. And now for my turn. (_Takes\nparcels, unwraps, and holds up dress with flowered sash._)\n\n_Dorothy._ (_excited_). Why mother I never had any thing like this in\nmy life! It\u2019s the first thing that I\u2019ve ever owned that didn\u2019t look\nas if some one had worn it till they were sick of it, first. I wish I\ncould see it in the glass. Who\u2019s our fairy godmother?\n\n_Mrs. B._ Why the Ladies\u2019 Aid Society of the Meadowbrooke Church. Don\u2019t\nyou remember that they wrote, saying that they were sending a box?\n\n_Dorothy._ Well, this is surely some box! Now mother, it\u2019s your turn!\n\n_Mrs. B._ (_unwraps sweater_). This must be for Rob! How pleased he\nwill be! I\u2019ll wrap it up again.\n\n_Dorothy._ That may be Rob\u2019s but I know I\u2019m going to borrow it\nsometimes! (_Tries on sweater._)\n\n_Mrs. B._ Now it\u2019s your turn to take a package.\n\n_Dorothy._ It\u2019s just like Aladdin\u2019s lamp. (_takes package_). Now I\nwonder what this is? (_Opens box_). O mother what lovely neckwear! It\u2019s\nalmost too dainty to touch. That pale blue will look so pretty with\nyour waist. Did I ever see such a box!\n\n_Mrs. B._ (_taking parcel_). I guess I am as excited as you are about\nit, Dorothy. (_Opens package_). This scarf must be for your father, and\nsee, here are gloves to go with it.\n\n_Dorothy._ Then I am going to throw away those gloves which you have\nmended and mended till they are nothing but mends. (_Takes gloves from\nmending basket and throws them in waste basket._)\n\n_Mrs. B._ (_reprovingly_). It doesn\u2019t take you long to learn to be\nextravagant!\n\n_Dorothy._ (_taking large package from box_). I wonder what\u2019s in this\nbig one. The best way to find out is to open it. (_Opens package\nand holds up eiderdown robe._) O mother, won\u2019t this be nice for you,\nso warm and comfy! You must try it on right away! (_Slips robe over\nmother\u2019s shoulders._)\n\n_Mrs. B._ I\u2019ll enjoy this I know! Now for my turn. (_Opens box of\nhandkerchiefs._) How dainty and pretty! We\u2019ll divide these, but you\nmustn\u2019t lose one!\n\n_Dorothy._ My turn for the fairy gift box. (_Opens parcel._) A fur cap\nfor Father! _Won\u2019t_ he be pleased! (_Tries cap on._) This looks nicely\non me, but I mustn\u2019t be selfish!\n\n_Mrs. B._ I should hope not, with all the lovely gifts, that you\nhave! (_Takes prettily decorated package._) Candy! Well, this is for\neverybody! I\u2019ll just keep it till father and Rob come back.\n\n_Dorothy._ (_reaching for it_). Perishable goods!\n\n_Mrs. B._ (_firmly_). I know it will be perishable if I put it where\nyou can get it!\n\n_Dorothy._ (_resigned_). Well, I\u2019ll be patient and wait. Now I\u2019ll put\nback father\u2019s and Rob\u2019s presents, and then I\u2019ll take some of this holly\nand decorate with it. Dear me! We won\u2019t recognize ourselves!\n\n_Mrs. B._ (_earnestly_). I am going to write at once to the\nMeadowbrooke ladies, and tell them what a beautiful Christmas they have\nmade for us.\n\n_Dorothy._ I take back all I said about a blue Christmas, and while you\nwrite _I\u2019m_ going to try on my new clothes.\n\n\nCURTAIN.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE III.\n\n\n(_Gladys stands on a chair endeavoring to festoon a rope of evergreen\nover the doorway or window frame._)\n\n_Gladys._ Well, somebody has to get up enough energy for a little bit\nof Christmas decorating, with father and Joe both away. Maybe I\u2019ll get\na tumble, but it will be in a good cause.\n\n(_Enter Marie, with tray._)\n\n_Gladys._ O Marie put your tray down and help me fix up this place so\nit will look more like Christmas and less like an apartment.\n\n_Marie._ (_politely_). Yes, Miss Gladys, (_aside_). It is a pleasure\nto see some cheerfulness. The madame! (_imitating_). Marie, the coffee\nis weak, the rolls are cold, the grapefruit is impossible! (_sets down\ntray_).\n\n_Gladys._ You hang a wreath in the window, and I\u2019ll fix this rope of\ngreen over the door. (_Marie and Gladys arrange greens._)\n\n_Gladys._ Now that is something like.\n\n_Marie._ Miss Gladys, I will remove the tray, for madam would\ndisapprove of it remaining here.\n\n_Gladys._ (_stepping down from chair_). Yes, and I might put my foot in\nher blue and gold coffee cup, and she would disapprove still more.\n\n(_Exit Marie with tray._)\n\n(_Enter Mrs. Worthington._)\n\n_Mrs. W._ (_languidly_). Good morning, Gladys.\n\n_Gladys._ (_cheerfully_). Good morning, mother. Just in time to open\nAunt Louisa\u2019s Christmas box.\n\n(_Mrs. W. seats herself and takes up bottle of smelling salts._)\n\n_Mrs. W._ (_listlessly_). I really am not interested especially in your\nAunt Louisa\u2019s box. It is past my comprehension why when she is a woman\nof such plain, not to say plebeian taste, she and your uncle should\nenjoy a comfortable income, when we are obliged to strive so hard to\nkeep up the appearance which our social position demands.\n\n_Gladys._ (_calling_). Marie! Bring a screwdriver or a nail file or\nsomething and we\u2019ll open the box. Well, mother, maybe Aunt Louisa\neconomizes more than we do, but my definition is that economy is\nspending your money in such a manner that you don\u2019t get any pleasure\nout of it.\n\n(_Enter Marie._)\n\n_Gladys._ Thank you, Marie. Now let\u2019s open the box. (_Both try to pry\nup lid, and finally are successful._)\n\n_Gladys._ Now mother, brace up, there\u2019s a nice lady, and take some\ninterest in your pretty gifts.\n\n_Mrs. W._ (_carelessly_). Gladys, I have told you I am too nervous to\ntake an interest in anything today. (_changing tone_). How shocking!\nWhy your aunt has stuffed the box with newspapers! Newspapers for\npacking Christmas gifts! What execrable ignorance! Marie, take them out\nquickly!\n\n_Marie._ (_respectfully_). Yes madam. (_aside_). Madam is not too\nnervous to take an interest now.\n\n(_Exit Marie._)\n\n_Gladys._ (_smiling_). O that\u2019s a novelty mother. Holly seals and red\nribbon are monotonous.\n\n_Gladys._ (_taking out parcel, and unwrapping it_). O how charming,\nmother! Here is a hat for me to wear on Fifth Avenue! I\u2019ll try it on!\n\n_Mrs. W._ (_paralyzed with indignation_). O what can your aunt Louisa\nbe thinking of! To insult me in this manner! That hat! How atrocious!\nMarie take it out of my sight!\n\n_Marie._ (_respectfully_). Yes madam. (_aside, holding up hat to\naudience_). A charming token from the beloved relatives!\n\n(_Exit Marie._)\n\n_Mrs. W._ (_gasping_). Gladys! My smelling salts! It is\nincomprehensible! What will your father say!\n\n_Gladys._ (_laughing_). He will say that it is exclusive and that you\nwon\u2019t find another in New York like it. (_unwraps parcel, and takes out\nmoth-eaten cape_). This is an evening wrap, which you can wear to the\nopera to-morrow evening. (_examining cape_). It looks as if the moth\nfamily and their relatives had been having an informal supper on this\nstylish garment.\n\n_Mrs. W._ Gladys how can you laugh? I shall not recover from this shock\nfor a year!\n\n(_Enter Marie._)\n\n_Mrs. W._ Marie, take that thing and tell the ashman to give it to his\npoor relations!\n\n_Marie._ (_respectfully_). Yes madam! (_aside_). Such a charming wrap,\nI almost fear to touch it! (_carries it gingerly_).\n\n(_Exit Marie._)\n\n_Gladys._ My dear brother is not forgotten I am glad to see! These ties\nwill cultivate a love of beauty.\n\n_Mrs. W._ And my poor boy must be insulted too! Terrible, terrible!\n(_uses smelling salts_).\n\n(_Enter Marie._)\n\n_Mrs. W._ Marie give these ties to your cousin, the policeman that\ncomes to call. He can wear them when he is off duty.\n\n_Marie._ Thank you for your kindness, Madam. (_aside_). Alphonse wear\nties like these? Never!\n\n_Gladys._ (_satirically_). Aunt Louisa remembers that you are an\ninvalid, and has sent this negligee (_hands shabby eiderdown robe to\nher mother_).\n\n_Mrs. W._ (_in agitation_). Gladys, how you can laugh at my poor\nhealth, is more than I can comprehend, and why your Aunt Louisa should\nhave chosen to make me the target of her insults is more than I can\nunderstand. Marie, give it to the rag man.\n\n_Marie._ Yes madam. (_aside_). I fear he would not accept it.\n\n(_Exit Marie._)\n\n_Gladys._ Well, mother, brother and I are some targets too. Here\u2019s a\ndress to wear to the Van Schuyler\u2019s tea, and here\u2019s a very nifty suit\nfor Rob. (_exhibits faded gingham, and patched suit_). The gingham\nhowever is a bit decollette, but it has the fashionable short skirt.\n\n_Mrs. W._ I am mortified beyond expression that Marie should witness\nthis frightful scene. Marie!\n\n_Gladys._ What makes you subpoena her as a witness then?\n\n(_Enter Marie._)\n\n_Marie._ You called Madam?\n\n_Mrs. W._ (_with dignity_). Marie put these shocking garments where I\nshall never see or hear of them again.\n\n_Marie._ Yes, madam.\n\n_Gladys._ (_rummaging in box_). Wait a minute Marie, and save your\nsteps. Here are a couple more offerings that will need your kind care.\n(_unwraps shawl_). Dearest mother, a fleecy shawl for your shoulders,\nto shield you from the chill winds. (_attempts to place shawl about her\nmother\u2019s shoulders_).\n\n_Mrs. W._ (_screaming_). Gladys! Take it away. How horrible! The thing\nisn\u2019t a shawl, it\u2019s a moth-hole!\n\n_Gladys._ (_continuing_). I feared that my dear father was to be\nforgotten, but he too is remembered. (_holds up overcoat_). An\novercoat, neat but not gaudy, with a pleasing openwork effect in the\nlining.\n\n_Mrs. W._ (_sinks back in chair_). I am overcome. Marie, take these\nabominable things away. I shall never recover from this shock, and I\nshall never forget this insult. (_dries her eyes_). And I shall write\nyour Aunt Louisa at once and tell her in unmistakable language, my\nopinion of her, in sending to me, to _me_ a box evidently intended for\nthe almshouse!\n\n\nCURTAIN.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE IV.\n\n\n(_As curtain rises, members of Ladies\u2019 Aid Society are seen removing\nwraps, the President, Mrs. Jenkins, being in the chair._)\n\n_President._ (_rapping upon table_). Will the meeting please come to\norder?\n\n_Miss Loomis._ (_wildly_). Where _is_ my other rubber? They were brand\nnew last week, and\u2014\n\n_President._ (_rapping again_). Ladies, will you _please_ come to\norder? We will open with the minutes of the last meeting, and Miss\nLoomis, who acted as secretary pro-tem, will read them.\n\n_Miss Loomis._ (_apologetically_). I didn\u2019t have time to copy them in\nthe book, but I have them on a piece of paper. (_rummages in bag_). I\u2019m\nsure I brought them. Here they are! (_reads_). Take one dozen eggs\u2014Oh,\nmercy no, that\u2019s the recipe for angel cake. Wait till I look again.\n(_takes crochet pattern from bag_). That\u2019s the pattern for lace that\nBrother Tom\u2019s wife gave me. (_Holds it up._) It\u2019s real pretty, isn\u2019t it?\n\n_Mrs. Hodges._ (_eagerly_). Let me see it!\n\n_Miss Loomis._ (_explaining_). You make a double crochet, after you\u2019ve\nchained twelve.\n\n_Mrs. Hodges._ Oh, that\u2019s easy! I could pick that out myself.\n\n(_Other members endeavor to examine the crochet pattern._)\n\n_President._ (_with dignity_). Miss Loomis, we are waiting for the\nminutes of the meeting.\n\n_Miss Loomis._ (_holding up paper_). O here they are! I\u2019ll read them!\n\n_Miss Loomis._ The regular meeting of the Ladies\u2019 Aid Society was\nheld on November tenth at the residence of Mrs. Winter, seven members\npresent, and the President, Mrs. Jenkins, being in the chair. Minutes\nof last meeting read and approved. Report of supper committee read and\napproved. Proceeds of harvest supper, seven dollars and thirty-five\ncents.\n\n_Mrs. Winter._ We charged too much for that supper, or we\u2019d have made\nmore money.\n\n_Mrs. Hodges._ (_sharply_). I don\u2019t think we charged too much\nconsidering the terrible price of food.\n\n_Mrs. Winter._ (_irritably_). Well, I don\u2019t like to work my feet off\nfor a measly seven dollars.\n\n_President._ (_rapping_). Ladies, will you please come to order. Miss\nLoomis, continue with your report.\n\n_Miss Loomis._ (_nervously_). I lost my place. Let\u2019s see\u2014\n\n_President._ (_to help her_). You were reading about the harvest supper.\n\n_Miss Loomis._ O yes. It was voted to send a box to Mrs. David Brown,\ncommittee to meet at the home of Mrs. Banks, chairlady of the committee.\n\n_Mrs. Banks._ There were only two of the society there.\n\n_Miss Loomis._ I was too busy to come, but I sent a nice hat for the\nmissionary\u2019s wife.\n\n_Mrs. Banks._ (_aside_). That terrible hat!\n\n_President._ Ladies, I must insist that you come to order.\n\n_Miss Loomis._ (_worried_). Where\u2019s that crochet pattern? I can\u2019t lose\nthat!\n\n_Mrs. Hodges._ (_handing it to her_). Here you are. I was just counting\nthe stitches.\n\n_President._ Miss Loomis, if you have finished your report, we will\nhear a letter received by Mrs. Hodges, our secretary, from Mrs. Brown.\n\n_Miss Loomis._ Yes, I guess that was all.\n\n_Mrs. Hodges._ (_nervously_). Wait till I find my glasses. (_rummaging\nin bag_). Here they are. (_Opens letter._)\n\n\u201cMy Dear Friends: Words fail me when I try to express my thanks for the\nbeautiful box which you sent.\u2014\u201d\n\n_Miss Loomis._ Pleased, wasn\u2019t she?\n\n\u201cMy heart is too full to write, as I think of the wonderful kindness\nwhich prompted you to send it.\u201d\n\n_Mrs. Winter._ (_puzzled_). They ain\u2019t usually so thankful.\n\n_President._ Ladies, please come to order, and let us listen to the\nletter.\n\n_Mrs. Hodges._ (_continuing_). The beautiful dress for my daughter.\n(_aside_). She meant that gingham of Clara\u2019s\u2014Where was I\u2014\u201cThe clothing\nfor myself which seems far too good for a missionary\u2019s wife\u2014\u201d\n\n_Miss Loomis._ Somehow that don\u2019t just fit our box.\n\n_Mrs. Hodges._ (_continuing_). \u201cThe gifts for my son and husband are\nmost thankfully received. Believe me dear friends, I am more than\ngrateful for your kindness.\n\n                                  \u201cYours very sincerely,\n                                               \u201cRUTH M. BROWN.\u201d\n\n_Mrs. Winter._ Somehow I can\u2019t quite figure that out.\n\n_Mrs. Hodges._ Ours was a nice box, nice enough, but she didn\u2019t have no\ncall to say quite so much.\n\n_Mrs. Banks._ (_rising_). Ladies, I have here a letter from my\nhusband\u2019s sister, Mrs. Worthington, which may throw some light upon\nMrs. Brown\u2019s letter. Each Christmas we send a box to Mrs. Worthington,\nand I have received this acknowledgment for the gifts which we sent\nthis year. (_Opens letter._)\n\n\u201cLouisa: I have just supervised the opening of a box, which while\ndirected to me was evidently destined for the almshouse. In fact,\nI doubt whether the inmates of the almshouse would have found the\ndonations acceptable. Beneath newspapers which formed the packing, I\nfound an article, which at first appeared to be a abandoned birds\u2019\nnest, but which upon closer inspection was evidently intended for a\nhat.\u201d\n\n_Miss Loomis._ (_aghast_). My hat! Why I paid five dollars for that\nhat eight years ago and it was perfectly good. A bird\u2019s nest! My hat!\n\n_Mrs. Banks._ (_calmly_). May I continue?\n\n\u201cThere were a motley collection of ghastly neckties, a tattered\novercoat, a forlorn gingham\u2014\u201d\n\n_Mrs. Hodges._ (_indignantly_). That was a perfectly good dress, only\nClara said she wouldn\u2019t wear it any more!\n\n_Mrs. Banks._ (_continuing_). \u201cAnd other disreputable apparel. I cannot\nunderstand the insult and assure you that I deem it unwarranted and\nunpardonable. I need hardly say that the garments were given to the rag\nman.\n\n                                          \u201cYour sister-in-law,\n                                                \u201cAMELIA WORTHINGTON.\u201d\n\n_Mrs. Winter._ What an awful letter!\n\n_Mrs. Hodges._ (_shocked_). I\u2019m glad I haven\u2019t relations-in-law like\nthat!\n\n_Mrs. Banks._ It is evidently clear to you ladies, that the labels upon\nthe boxes were mixed, and the box for my sister-in-law reached Mrs.\nBrown, while the missionary box which we packed was sent by mistake to\nMrs. Worthington.\n\n_Miss Loomis._ (_indignantly_). To say that my hat was a birds\u2019 nest!\n\n_Mrs. Winter._ And disreputable apparel!\n\n_President._ Ladies, will you come to order! I regret of course that\nthe mistake has been made, for doubtless it places Mrs. Banks in a very\nembarrassing position.\n\n_Mrs. Banks._ (_nervously_). Embarrassing is no word for it. She\nwas so mad, it showed in her handwriting. (_Passes letter round for\ninspection._)\n\n_Mrs. Hodges._ (_gently_). Well, there is one good side to it. The\nmissionary was pleased with her box, and I guess Clara\u2019s dress was\npretty faded.\n\n_Mrs. Winter._ (_apologetically_). And I might have taken time to mend\nthe overcoat.\n\n_Miss Loomis._ (_firmly_). I make no apologies for my hat!\n\n_President._ I suppose we could have fixed up the box meant for the\nmissionary with pretty wrappings, like we do other peoples.\n\n_Mrs. Hodges._ (_rising_). Ladies, may I say a few words?\n\n_President._ Mrs. Hodges has the floor.\n\n_Mrs. Hodges._ I think this has been a lesson to us, although it has\nprobably made a peck of trouble for Mrs. Banks.\n\n_Mrs. Banks._ That\u2019s so!\n\n_Mrs. Hodges._ I think it shows us that our missionary likes pretty\nthings the same as we do.\n\n_Miss Loomis._ (_interrupting_). That\u2019s why I sent my hat!\n\n_Mrs. Hodges._ (_continuing_). And while I am sorry that it has made\ntrouble for Mrs. Banks, I can\u2019t help being glad that the missionary got\nthe nice box, so I would move that hereafter we make our missionary\nChristmas boxes as nice as those we send our husband\u2019s relations.\n\n_All._ Second the motion!\n\n_President._ It is moved and seconded that hereafter we make the boxes\nwe send to our missionaries as good as those which are intended for our\nhusband\u2019s relations. All in favor say \u201cAye.\u201d\n\n_All._ (_heartily_). Aye!\n\n_President._ Opposed?
