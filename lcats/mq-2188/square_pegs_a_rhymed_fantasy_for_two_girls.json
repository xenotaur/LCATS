Entrance right and left. Left, a table and two chairs. (The\ngeneral effect should suggest a little lawn which leads outward in\nseveral directions.)_\n\n_The arrival of a taxicab is heard, off. Enter left_, HILDA _in\nsummer hat and dress and with a light cloak on her arm. She carries a\nfolding-map and a small book._\n\nHILDA (_speaking off, left_).\n\n    What's that? As certain as your name's Joe Billings\n    The taximeter points at fifteen shillings.\n    Well, and you've had a pound. What? Made a slip?\n    _I_ thought five shillings was a handsome tip.\n    You want my father's home-address? 'The Haven,\n    Chad Crescent, Baystead, North-West 57.'\n    He'll write you out a cheque--I'm sure he will.\n\n                               [_Sound of a motor-horn growing fainter._\n\n    The creature's gone. These taxi-men! But still--\n    At last I've found the Enchanted Garden... Wait:\n    Suppose that isn't really Merlin's Gate,\n    Nor this the garden where a girl who loathes\n    Our Twentieth Century (all except its clothes)\n    May turn the Book of Time to any page\n    And find herself back in a lovelier age?\n    The map will show. Yes, there's the gate, and there's\n    That wall, that table, these two empty chairs...\n    Everything's right. How wonderful, how splendid,\n    To know that here the roar of time has ended!\n    Now, let me see...                            [_Consulting her map._\n\n                       If I should take that road\n    What century should I have for my abode?\n    'To Ancient Rome.' Lovely!\n\n                             [_She starts to go out, right. Then stops._\n\n                               It might be serious,\n    Though, if I chanced on Nero or Tiberius.\n    The Romans had no manners... This way here--\n    So the map says--would lead me to the year\n    Ten-sixty-six. I won't be such a fool\n    As go back where I stuck so long at school.\n    William the First was always dull. I know\n    He'd make me listen to him--standing so,\n    With Bayeux hands, knee crook\u00e8d, and neck bowed--\n    While he read all the Domesday Book aloud.\n    I shan't go there... Now, that's a pretty view!\n\n                                                [_Referring to the map._\n\n    'The Eighteenth Century: Boswell Avenue.'\n    I might try that. But no--that won't do either.\n    I'd have to wear a wig or tell them why there,\n    Love coffee-houses more than trees and birds\n    And talk in such tremendously long words.\n    I know, I know! If I can find the way\n    I'll wander back into the sumptuous day\n    When, in his gardens near the warm lagoon,\n    Titian gave feasts under the stars and moon.\n    That would be heavenly! Those were noble times.\n    There was a grandeur even about the crimes\n    Of people like the Borgias ... and their dresses,\n    And the sweet way they wore their hair in tresses,\n    And--oh, and everything! What was Titian's date?\n    I mustn't err into a time too late;\n    But how to make quite sure? I'll take a look\n    In this adorable fire-coloured book--\n    Addington Symonds... Oh, that I knew more!\n    Was it in fifteen-sixty or before?\n\n           [_Settling herself in one of the chairs, she becomes absorbed\n               in her book. Enter, right_, GIOCONDA _carrying two or\n               three modern novels_.\n\nGIOCONDA (_speaking off, right_).\n\n    I thank you, gondolier. You drowned my nurse\n    With true dramatic finish. Take this purse.\n    So--I am in that Garden where time speeds\n    Backward or forward as our fancy needs.\n    How sick I am of cloaks and ambuscades,\n    Of poison, daggers, moonlight serenades,\n    Of those dull dances that are all _I_ get--\n    Pavane, gavotte, forlana, minuet--\n    And the long pageant of our life at Venice!\n    Now, in the Twentieth Century there is tennis,\n    With cream and strawberries round a chestnut-tree,\n    And day-long idling in the June-blue sea,\n    And soda-fountains, too, and motor-cars,\n    And Henley Weeks and Russian Ballet 'stars.'\n    Oh, what a wealth of joy that century has!\n    To think that I myself may learn to jazz!\n    Truly, I judge it has no slightest flaw--\n    The glorious age of Bennett, Wells, and Shaw.\n\n                [_She sets her books on the table and curtsies to them._\n\n    Gramercy now--Shaw, Bennett, Wells, and Co.--\n    Since you have shown me what I longed to know,\n    How to behave, talk, smoke, and bob my hair\n    In nineteen-twenty, when at last I'm there.\n    Could I but find a guide! How shall I tell\n    Which road to follow? If I listen well\n    I ought to hear the roaring of their trains,\n    Their motor-horns, their humming monoplanes...\n\n                                   [_She listens intently for a moment._\n\n    The very bees are silent...                         [_Seeing_ HILDA.\n\n                                Who is that?\n    Surely, unless the books have lied, her hat\n    Came from 'Roulette's,' in Portman Square, West One!\n    A Twentieth-Century girl! The thing is done--\n    I need but ask her which way London lies.\n\n                                             [_Kissing her hand, right._\n\n    Farewell, Rialto! Farewell, Bridge of Sighs!\n\n                   [_She goes up to_ HILDA _and curtsies ceremoniously_.\n\n    Dear Signorina ... Signorina ... Deep\n    In Bennett's fragrant works, or can she sleep?\n    Could _The Five Towns_ have bored her? Let me try\n    Once more. Most noble Signorina...\n\nHILDA (_starting up_).\n\n                                       Why,\n    Who are you, lady? By your dress and ways\n    I think you must have come from Titian's days.\n\nGIOCONDA.\n\n    Indeed, I do. Old Titian! How he talks!\n    He did my portrait last July in chalks.\n    But grant me the great liberty, I pray,\n    Of asking what your name is...\n\nHILDA.\n\n                                   Hilda Gray.\n\nGIOCONDA.\n\n    How sweet and to the point!\n\nHILDA.\n\n                                And yours?\n\nGIOCONDA.\n\n                                           Gioconda\n    Francesca Violante Giulia della Bionda.\n\nHILDA.\n\n    It is a poem in itself! It shines\n    Like the soft sheen on Tasso's velvet lines.\n    What can have led you to forego an age\n    When life was an illuminated page\n    From some superb romance?\n\nGIOCONDA.\n\n                              And what, I wonder,\n    Can have torn you and your rich time asunder?\n\nHILDA.\n\n    I'll tell you, for I'm sure you'll sympathise.\n    I have a lover...\n\nGIOCONDA.\n\n                      That is no surprise.\n\nHILDA.\n\n    And by the post this morning came a letter--\n\nGIOCONDA.\n\n    From him?\n\nHILDA.\n\n              From him.\n\nGIOCONDA.\n\n                        What could have happened better?\n\nHILDA.\n\n    Ah! naturally you think that Harry writes\n    Of longing, suicide, and sleepless nights.\n    Did he, I'd read his letters ten times over--\n    But you don't know the Twentieth Century lover.\n    Oh, for a man who'd write through tears, all swimmily,\n    And woo me with grand metaphor and simile!\n    I couldn't bear the slang that Harry used\n    In asking for my hand.\n\nGIOCONDA.\n\n                  So you refused!\n\nHILDA.\n\n    Yes, and came here to seek a braver time.\n\nGIOCONDA.\n\n    How odd! _I_ had a letter, all in rhyme,\n    Brought by a lackey to my father's gate\n    Just when dawn broke. As if I couldn't wait!\n    He dashed up, panting; and his horse's mouth\n    Was flecked with blood and foam...\n\nHILDA (_clasping her hands_).\n\n                                      The passionate South!\n\nGIOCONDA.\n\n    The fellow gave the letter, gasped, went red,\n    And straightway horse and lackey fell down dead.\n    I scanned the note, observed the flowery phrases\n    In which the writer smothered me with praises;\n    Compared them with the style of Bernard Shaw,\n    And told him briskly that he might withdraw.\n\nHILDA.\n\n    If I could see that letter!\n\nGIOCONDA.\n\n                                So you shall,\n    Sweet friend--or, rather, right you are, old pal.\n    I'll read it.\n\n                [_She produces a letter tied with rose-coloured ribbon._\n\nHILDA.\n\n                  Do!...
