We know\nthem by name; their names are household words. We know them by fame;\ntheir fame is immortal. So we pay tribute to them by purchasing their\nbooks--and, too often, rest satisfied with that. The riches that they\noffer us are within arm\u2019s length, and we leave them there. We go our\nways seeking for mental nourishment, when our larders at home are full.\n\n\n\nThree hundred years ago last week William Shakespeare died, but\nShakespeare, the poet, is more alive today than when his bones were\nlaid to rest in Stratford. It was not until seven years after his\ndeath that the first collected edition of his works was published.\nToday there are thousands of editions, and new ones appear each year.\nIt seems that we must all have Shakespeare in our homes. And why? Is\nit simply to give character to our bookshelves; or is it because we\nrealize that the works of Shakespeare and of his fellow immortals are\nthe foundation stones of literature, and that we want to be near them\nand know them?\n\n\n\nWe value anniversaries most of all as occasions for placing fresh\nwreaths of laurel on life\u2019s altars. In the memory of Shakespeare, then,\nlet us pledge ourselves anew to our library gods. Let us turn their\nglowing pages again--and read once more those inspired messages of mind\nand heart in which we find life\u2019s meaning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Pioneer Prose Writers\n\nJONATHAN EDWARDS\n\nMonograph Number One in The Mentor Reading Course\n\n\nJonathan Edwards was one of the most impressive figures of his time.\nHe was a deep thinker, a strong writer, a powerful theologian, and\na constructive philosopher. He was born on October 5, 1703, at East\n(now South) Windsor, Connecticut. His father, Timothy Edwards, was a\nminister of East Windsor, and also a tutor. Jonathan, the only son, was\nthe fifth of eleven children.\n\nEven as a boy he was thoughtful and serious minded. It is recorded that\nhe never played the games, or got mixed up in the mischief that the\nusual boy indulges in. When he was only ten years old he wrote a tract\non the soul. Two years later he wrote a really remarkable essay on the\n\u201cFlying Spider.\u201d He entered Yale and graduated at the head of his class\nas valedictorian. The next two years he spent in New Haven studying\ntheology. In February, 1727, he was ordained minister at Northampton,\nMassachusetts. In the same year he married Sarah Pierrepont, who was an\nadmirable wife and became the mother of his twelve children.\n\nIn 1733 a great revival in religion began in Northampton. So intense\ndid this become in that winter that the business of the town was\nthreatened. In six months nearly 300 were admitted to the church. Of\ncourse Edwards was a leading spirit in this revival. The orthodox\nleaders of the church had no sympathy with it. At last a crisis came in\nEdwards\u2019 relations with his congregation, which finally ended in his\nbeing driven from the church.\n\nEdwards and his family were now thrown upon the world with nothing\nto live on. After some time he became pastor of an Indian mission at\nStockbridge, Massachusetts. He preached to the Indians through an\ninterpreter, and in every way possible defended their interests against\nthe whites, who were trying to enrich themselves at the expense of the\nred men.\n\nPresident Burr of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University)\ndied in 1757. Five years before he had married one of Edwards\u2019\ndaughters. Jonathan Edwards was elected to his place, and installed\nin February, 1758. There was smallpox in Princeton at this time, and\nthe new president was inoculated for it. His feeble constitution could\nnot bear the shock, and he died on March 22. He was buried in the old\ncemetery at Princeton.\n\nEdwards in personal appearance was slender and about six feet tall,\nwith an oval, gentle, almost feminine face which made him look the\nscholar and the mystic. But he had a violent temper when aroused, and\nwas a strict parent. He did not allow his boys out of doors after nine\no\u2019clock at night, and if any suitor of his daughter remained beyond\nthat hour he was quietly but forcibly informed that it was time to lock\nup the house.\n\nJonathan Edwards would not be called an eloquent speaker today; but his\nsermons were forceful, and charged with his personality. These sermons\nwere written in very small handwriting, with the lines close together.\nIt was Edwards\u2019 invariable habit to read them. He leaned with his left\nelbow on the cushion of the pulpit, and brought the finely written\nmanuscript close to his eyes. He used no gestures; but shifted from\nfoot to foot while reading.\n\n    PREPARED BY THE EDITORIAL STAFF OF THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION\n    ILLUSTRATION FOR THE MENTOR, VOL. 4, No. 6, SERIAL No. 106\n    COPYRIGHT, 1916, BY THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION, INC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Pioneer Prose Writers\n\nBENJAMIN FRANKLIN\n\nMonograph Number Two in The Mentor Reading Course\n\n\nProbably no American of humble origin ever attained to more enduring\nfame than many-sided Benjamin Franklin. The secret of his rise can be\ntersely told. He had ceaseless energy, guided by a passion for the\nimprovement of mankind. A recital of his accomplishments sounds like a\nround of the old counting game, \u201cdoctor, lawyer, merchant, chief.\u201d He\nwas, in fact, all the list except the \u201cthief.\u201d\n\nBoston gave him to America on January 17, 1706, but Philadelphia\nclaimed him early, and he stamped himself upon the Quaker City almost\nas definitely as did William Penn.\n\nPassing over his precocious boyhood, when he wrote for the Boston\npublication of his brother James with a skill that at the time was held\nastonishing, the day he reached Philadelphia he was a great, overgrown\nboy, his clothes most unsightly; for he had been wrecked trying to make\nan economical trip from New York by sailboat. With the exception of a\nsingle Dutch dollar he was penniless. As he trudged about the streets,\nhis big eyes drinking in the sights, his cupid-bow mouth ready to smile\nat the slightest provocation, he munched a roll of bread. His reserve\nfood supply was a loaf under each arm.\n\nHe was an expert printer, and printers were wanted in Philadelphia. He\nsoon got a job, after which he found a boarding place in the home of\none Read, with whose daughter, Deborah, he promptly fell in love.\n\nAfter a few years the governor of Pennsylvania urged him to go to\nLondon to purchase a printing plant of his own. The official had\npromised to send letters and funds aboard the ship in the mail-bag; but\nat the critical moment forgot all about it. So young Franklin landed in\nLondon without a cent, and played a short engagement as \u201cbeggar man.\u201d\n\nAgain his skill as a printer saved him from want, and he remained five\nyears, having a most interesting time, meeting many of the great men of\nEngland, all of whom were charmed with his wit and philosophy.\n\nIn all that period he did not write a single letter to Deborah Read;\nyet he seemed surprised and hurt on his return to Philadelphia to find\nthe young woman married to another. But Deborah\u2019s husband, who had\ntreated her cruelly, quite civilly left her a widow, so that Franklin,\ncareless but faithful, was able ultimately to claim her as his wife.\n\nFor the next twenty years Franklin did something new at almost every\nturn. He flew a kite in a thunder shower, drew down electricity,\nand invented the lightning rod, to the salvation of generations of\nrural sales agents. He invented a stove that still holds his name. He\norganized the first fire company in America, and founded the first\npublic library. All the while he was publishing \u201cPoor Richard\u2019s\nAlmanac,\u201d which to this day ranks as an epigrammatic masterpiece.\n\nAmerican politics soon claimed Franklin as an ideal diplomatist.\nEnglish and Scottish universities honored him with degrees for his\ndiscoveries and writings. In Paris he became the most popular man of\nthe period, and was overwhelmed with attention from all classes.\n\nHe was one of the first signers of the Declaration of Independence; and\nhe rounded out his political career as governor of Pennsylvania and one\nof the framers of the Constitution. He died in Philadelphia in April,\n1790, in some respects the greatest of Americans.\n\n    PREPARED BY THE EDITORIAL STAFF OF THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION\n    ILLUSTRATION FOR THE MENTOR, VOL. 4, No. 6, SERIAL No. 106\n    COPYRIGHT, 1916, BY THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION, INC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Pioneer Prose Writers\n\nCHARLES BROCKDEN BROWN\n\nMonograph Number Three in The Mentor Reading Course\n\n\nCharles Brockden Brown has often been called the earliest American\nnovelist; but today his books are very rarely read. All of them are\nromantic and weird, with incidents bordering on the supernatural. They\nare typical of the kind of novel general at the time Brown lived.\n\nHe was born on January 17, 1771, in Philadelphia. His parents were\nQuakers. As a boy his health was bad, and since he was not able to\njoin with other boys in outdoor sports he spent most of his time in\nstudy. His principal amusement was the invention of ideal architectural\ndesigns, planned on the most extensive and elaborate scale. Later this\nbent for construction developed into schemes for ideal commonwealths.\nStill later it showed itself in the elaborate plots of his novels.\n\nBrown planned in the early part of his life to study law; but his\nconstitution was too feeble for this arduous work. He had his share of\nthe youthful dreams of great literary conquests. He planned a great\nepic on the discovery of America, with Columbus as his hero; another\nwith the adventures of Pizarro for the subject; and still another\nupon the conquests of Cortes. However, as with the case of many great\ndreams, they were given up.\n\nWhen he was still a boy he wrote a romance called \u201cCarsol,\u201d which\nwas not published, however, until after his death. The next thing he\nwrote was an essay on the question of women\u2019s rights and liberties.\nThis question was already becoming an important one in England, where\nWilliam Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft were publishing their writings.\nBrown was much influenced by the works of both.\n\nAlthough Brown\u2019s books make heavy reading, yet his companionships were\nof the liveliest. It was said that no man ever had truer friends or\nloved these friends better. One of his closest friends was Dr. Eli\nSmith, a literary man. It was through him that Brown was introduced\ninto the Friendly Club of New York City, where he met many other\nworkers in the literary field. And it was under their influence that he\nproduced his first, important work.\n\nThis was a novel published in 1798, called \u201cWieland, or the\nTransformation.\u201d A mystery, seemingly inexplicable, is solved as a\ncase of ventriloquism, which at that time was just beginning to be\nunderstood thoroughly. His next book was \u201cArthur Mervyn,\u201d remarkable\nfor its description of the epidemic of yellow fever in Philadelphia.\n\u201cEdgar Huntley,\u201d a romance rich in local color, followed this. An\neffective use is made of somnambulism, and in it Brown anticipates\nJames Fenimore Cooper\u2019s introduction of the American Indian into\nfiction.\n\nThe novelist then wrote two novels dealing with ordinary life; but they\nproved to be failures. Then he began to compile a general system of\ngeography, to edit a periodical, and to write political pamphlets; but\nall the time his health was failing. On February 22, 1810, he died of\ntuberculosis.\n\nHis biographer, William Dunlap, who was the novelist\u2019s friend, says\nthat Brown was the purest and most amiable of men, due perhaps to his\nQuaker education. His manner was at times a little stiff and formal;\nbut in spite of this he was deeply loved by his friends.\n\n    PREPARED BY THE EDITORIAL STAFF OF THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION\n    ILLUSTRATION FOR THE MENTOR, VOL. 4, No. 6, SERIAL No. 106\n    COPYRIGHT, 1916, BY THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION, INC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Pioneer Prose Writers\n\nWASHINGTON IRVING\n\nMonograph Number Four in The Mentor Reading Course\n\n\nA bankruptcy produced one of the greatest American writers. If the\nbusiness house with which Washington Irving was associated had not\nfailed, he might never have seriously attempted to take up literature.\n\nWashington Irving was born in New York City on April 3, 1783. He was\nnamed after George Washington, who at that time was the idol of the\nAmerican people. Both his parents were immigrants from Great Britain.\nHis father was a prosperous merchant at the time of Irving\u2019s birth.\n\nIrving was a mischievous boy. Perhaps this was due to the fact that\nDeacon Irving was a severe father. He detested the theater, and\npermitted no reading on Sunday except the Bible and the Catechism.\nWashington was permitted on weekdays to read only Gulliver\u2019s Travels\nand Robinson Crusoe. Nevertheless, in spite of his father\u2019s strictness,\nthe boy managed to steal away from home to attend the theater.\n\nIrving intended to be a lawyer; but his health gave way, and he had\nto take a voyage to Europe. In this journey he went as far as Rome,\nand in England made the acquaintance of Washington Allston, the famous\nAmerican painter, who was then living there. On his return he was\nadmitted to the bar; but he made little effort at practising.\n\nIn the meanwhile, however, he, his brother William, and J. K. Paulding\nwrote some humorous sketches called \u201cSalmagundi Papers,\u201d which were\nquite successful.\n\nAbout this time came the single romance of Irving\u2019s life. Judge\nHoffman, in whose law office he was, had a daughter named Matilda.\nThe young lawyer fell in love with her; but this romance was brought\nto a tragic end by her death. Irving never married, remaining true\nthroughout life to the memory of this early attachment.\n\nIrving\u2019s first important piece of writing was the Knickerbocker History\nof New York. It was a clever parody of a history of the city published\nby Dr. Samuel Mitchell. The book was received with enthusiasm by the\npublic, and Irving\u2019s reputation was made.\n\nHis health, never of the best, again gave way. In 1815 he revisited\nEurope, and made the acquaintance of many important people there,\nincluding Disraeli, Campbell, and Scott. The business in which he was\na silent partner fell into bad conditions and ended with a bankruptcy\nwhich left Irving virtually without resources. His brother, who was\nan influential member of Congress, secured for him a secretaryship in\nthe United States Navy Department with a salary of $2,500 a year; but\nIrving declined this, with the intention of writing for a living.\n\nFrom that time he was successful. All his books were eagerly received,\nand it was not long before he was considered America\u2019s leading writer.\nHe went to Spain as attach\u00e9 of the American legation in 1826. When he\nreturned to the United States he found his name a household word. Then\nhe decided to settle down somewhere in the country and quietly enjoy\nlife. He built a delightful home on the Hudson River, New York, to\nwhich he gave the name of \u201cSunnyside,\u201d where he spent his last years.\nHis charming personality attracted to him many friends, and there were\nno worries to bother him. He continued his writing to the very last.\nHe died of heart disease at Sunnyside on November 28, 1859. On the day\nof his funeral all the shops in Tarrytown were closed and draped in\nmourning. Both sides of the road leading to his grave at Sleepy Hollow\nwere crowded with sorrowful mourners.\n\n    PREPARED BY THE EDITORIAL STAFF OF THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION\n    ILLUSTRATION FOR THE MENTOR, VOL. 4, No. 6, SERIAL No. 106\n    COPYRIGHT, 1916, BY THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION, INC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Pioneer Prose Writers\n\nJAMES KIRKE PAULDING\n\nMonograph Number Five in The Mentor Reading Course\n\n\n  \u201cPeter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers;\n  Where is the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked?\u201d\n\nIt is rather unusual to find that the most familiar writing of an\nauthor is merely a bit of nonsense. Yet the verse of James Kirke\nPaulding best known to us today is the tongue-twister quoted above. He\nwrote poetry, most of which is gracefully commonplace, and a good many\nnovels, attractive in style but of no great interest.\n\nJames Kirke Paulding was born in Dutchess County, New York, on August\n22, 1779. He attended the village school for a short time; but in 1800\nwent to New York City, where, in connection with his brother-in-law,\nWilliam Irving, and Washington Irving, another of the American pioneer\nprose writers, he began to publish in January, 1807, a series of short,\nlightly humorous articles called the \u201cSalmagundi Papers.\u201d In 1814 a\npolitical pamphlet of his, \u201cThe United States and England,\u201d attracted\nthe notice of President Madison. He was favorably impressed, and the\nnext year appointed him secretary to the Board of Navy Commissioners.\nHe held this position until November, 1823. He was navy agent in New\nYork City from 1825 to 1837.\n\nPaulding was always a successful man of affairs and an able politician.\nIn recognition of his ability, President Van Buren made him a member of\nhis cabinet in 1837 as Secretary of the Navy.\n\nLater he retired to Poughkeepsie, New York, where he divided his time\nbetween writing and farming. He died on April 6, 1860.\n\nPaulding came of good old Knickerbocker blood. In his work he never\nliked to revise what he had already written, nor did he plan out his\nbooks. His best known work is perhaps the \u201cDutchman\u2019s Fireside,\u201d which\nhas many pleasing pages of Dutch life.\n\nHe also wrote a number of poems; but these do not measure up to the\nstandards of good poetry. One of them, \u201cThe Backwoodsman,\u201d extends over\nthree thousand lines, few of which may be termed good.\n\nPaulding was one of the first distinctively American writers. From\nhis father, an active Revolutionary patriot, he inherited strong\nanti-British sentiments. Throughout his life he was a vigorous\nprotester against intellectual thraldom to the mother country.\n\n    PREPARED BY THE EDITORIAL STAFF OF THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION\n    ILLUSTRATION FOR THE MENTOR, VOL. 4, No. 6, SERIAL No. 106\n    COPYRIGHT, 1916, BY THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION, INC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Pioneer Prose Writers\n\nJAMES FENIMORE COOPER\n\nMonograph Number Six in The Mentor Reading Course\n\n\nJames Fenimore Cooper was one of the most popular writers that ever\nlived. Almost every American has read some or all of Cooper\u2019s books,\nand his stories have been translated into nearly all the languages of\nEurope, and indeed into some of Asia. Balzac, the French novelist,\nadmired him greatly. Victor Hugo, another famous French writer, said\nthat Cooper was greater than any novelist living at that time. Many of\nCooper\u2019s readers gave him the title of \u201cThe American Walter Scott.\u201d\n\nCooper was born at Burlington, New Jersey, September 15, 1789. His\nboyhood was spent in the wild country around Otsego Lake, New York. His\nfather was a judge and a member of Congress. Cooper entered Yale at the\nearly age of fourteen, and was the youngest student on the rolls.\n\nAt college he did not pay much attention to his studies, and in fact\nwas rather wayward. Before he had even completed his junior year, his\nresignation was requested. His father interceded for him; but it was\nuseless. The young man then entered the United States navy; but, after\nbecoming a midshipman, he resigned to marry. He then settled down in\nWestchester County, New York. His home life proved to be most happy.\n\nHe published his first book, \u201cPrecaution,\u201d anonymously. Then came \u201cThe\nSpy,\u201d in 1821, a success from the very first. Many novels followed in\nrapid succession. In 1826 he went to Paris, where he published \u201cThe\nPrairie,\u201d which many consider the best of all his books. He became very\npopular abroad. The most distinguished people of Europe felt honored to\nentertain him.\n\nIn 1833 he returned to America, where he discovered that his popularity\nwas declining, as American critics did not believe that his later\nbooks were measuring up to his earlier standard. He resented the sharp\ncriticism of several of his writings, and much ill feeling grew up\nbetween the novelist and the public.\n\nIn particular he was on bad terms with his neighbors in the village\nof Cooperstown, New York, where he lived. This came to a climax\nin a fierce quarrel over the ownership of a bit of woodland which\nextended into the lake near his home, Otsego Hall. Cooper won in the\ncourts;--but the villagers evened things up with him by personal\nattacks. Law-suits followed one after another. Although Cooper\npretended indifference to public opinion, nevertheless he suffered\nunder the abusive attacks.\n\nCooper was not on intimate terms with the prominent literary men of his\nday. Toward the end of his life he loved his home more and more. He\nwas fond of walking in the woods and fields, and, as he himself said,\nhe had \u201can old man\u2019s yearning for the solemn shadows of the trees.\u201d\nOn September 14, 1851, he died peacefully in his home at Cooperstown,\nsurrounded by members of his family.\n\n    PREPARED BY THE EDITORIAL STAFF OF THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION\n    ILLUSTRATION FOR THE MENTOR, VOL. 4, No. 6, SERIAL No. 106\n    COPYRIGHT, 1916, BY THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION, INC.\n\n\n\n\nAMERICAN PIONEER PROSE WRITERS\n\n_Author and Critic_\n\nMODELED BY GIUSEPPE CENACHI]\n\nTHE MENTOR\n\nMAY 1, 1916 \u00b7 DEPARTMENT OF LITERATURE\n\n    MENTOR GRAVURES\n\n    JONATHAN EDWARDS\n    BENJAMIN FRANKLIN\n    CHARLES BROCKDEN BROWN\n    WASHINGTON IRVING\n    JAMES KIRKE PAULDING\n    JAMES FENIMORE COOPER\n\nBuilt 1737--Torn down 1812]\n\nThe literatures of the great nations have begun with the childhood of\nthose nations; that is to say, with fairy tales and legends and songs\nof heroism; with Homer\u2019s \u201cIliad\u201d and \u201cOdyssey,\u201d the Song of Beowulf\n(bay\u00b4-o-wulf), to name a few among many of the great beginnings of\nwriting. In this country the pioneer writers shared the conditions of\nthe pioneer builders of homes and communities. They were not, however,\na people in their intellectual infancy. The country was new; but the\npeople were old. They had all left literature of a high order behind\nthem. Many of them must have been familiar with poetry and prose in\nEnglish, French, and German, to say nothing of the classic literature\nwhich the scholars knew; and there were many scholars, north and south,\namong the early settlers.\n\nThe exploration and settlement of the country was a great adventure,\nwhich involved not only peril, but very hard work. In every colony\npeople had to begin at the beginning,--to get roofs over their heads\nto protect them from the climate, to raise the things they were to\neat, to protect themselves from the Indians,--to do a thousand things\nof which people of our day are unconscious because they were done so\nlong ago. The distances between the colonies were great, the means of\ncommunication were slow and infrequent, and the colonists knew very\nlittle of one another. They were isolated communities, not in any\nsense a nation. And so the early writing was the expression of the\nexperiences and convictions of small communities. There cannot be a\nnational literature until there is a national consciousness; and in the\nearly days in America there was not even a sectional consciousness.\nThere was only local consciousness.\n\nSet by Jonathan Edwards in 1730--The house of Josiah D. Whitney stands\non the right of Edwards\u2019 house]\n\nThe first book written on the continent was by that flamboyant, but\nvery versatile Virginia colonist, Captain John Smith; a brave soldier,\nwith a very warm and highly inventive imagination, whose habit of\nboasting has robbed him of a great deal of credit which really belonged\nto him. He wrote an account of adventures in Virginia, which may be\ntaken as the beginning of American writing, and still has value. There\nwas a long interval during which the writing of the colonists was\ndevoted to theological discussion, or to accounts of the new world in\nwhich they were living.\n\nA large part of the early writings of New England was more or less\ntheological; but none of this writing rose to the rank of literature\nuntil Jonathan Edwards appeared in the first half of the eighteenth\ncentury.\n\n\nJONATHAN EDWARDS\n\nThe son of a minister who was a lover of learning as well as of\nreligion, like a great many other ministers of his time in New England,\nwho prepared young men for college, and gave his daughters the same\nkind of instruction in the same subjects. Edwards was also the grandson\nof a minister on his mother\u2019s side; and his ancestry, like his\ndescendants, was notable for intellectual vigor. He graduated from Yale\nCollege at the age of thirteen,--not an uncommon happening in that day\nof few entrance requirements,--and the qualities of his mind and the\ndirection of his taste are indicated by the fact that he was already\nmaking notes on the mind and on natural philosophy. He studied for the\nministry, and when he was twenty-four years old settled at Northampton,\nMassachusetts, where he was fortunate enough to marry a woman as\nremarkable as himself, of whom he wrote a description which has become\na classic in the literature of love. Edwards was pursued by a haunting\nsense of sinfulness, and the depravity of the world often weighed\nheavily upon him. Mrs. Edwards happily combined a piety equal to that\nof her husband with great cheerfulness of disposition.\n\nFifth and Arch Sts., Philadelphia]\n\n\nEDWARDS AS AN AUTHOR\n\nA man of his intensity was certain to come into collision with some of\nthe ideas held by his contemporaries and with much of their practice;\nand Edwards finally antagonized his congregation to such a degree\nthat at the age of fifty-six he preached his farewell sermon. Several\navenues of work were open to him, for he had become a man of wide\nreputation; but he settled at Stockbridge, Massachusetts, and wrote\nin the quiet of what was then a wilderness his famous treatise on \u201cThe\nFreedom of the Will,\u201d which is probably the most important American\ncontribution to philosophy. It is his sermons, however, rather than his\ntreatises, which entitle his work to a place in the history of American\nliterature. Between eleven and twelve hundred of these sermons are\npreserved in Yale University Library. They are characterized by great\nvigor of thought, intensity of feeling, and often impressive power of\nstatement. One of them, more famous, though in some respects not so\ntrue a piece of literature as others, \u201cSinners in the Hands of an Angry\nGod,\u201d created great commotion in its time, and the glow of the fire\nwhich possessed the preacher has not yet wholly faded from its pages.\n\n\nLITERATURE OF THE REVOLUTION\n\nAs the War of the Revolution approached the colonists began to have\nhopes and fears in common, and the war was preceded by a war of words.\nThe grievances of the colonists were stated many times, sometimes with\ngreat force of reasoning and clearness; and a literature of discussion\nand debate, which reached the public largely through pamphlets, came\ninto existence. Samuel Adams of Massachusetts wrote a stirring defense\nof the rights of the colonists. James Adams, James Otis, and Thomas\nJefferson came to the front in this discussion; and their writing took\non the dignity of literature.\n\n\nTHOMAS PAINE\n\nOne of the most vigorous contributors to this discussion was Thomas\nPaine, an Englishman by birth, whose ability as a writer attracted the\nattention of Benjamin Franklin, then in London, at whose suggestion\nPaine came to America. He had already made himself somewhat noted as\na radical critic of the English government and political system, and\nwithin a year of his arrival in this country became editor of the\nPennsylvania Magazine. His \u201cCommon Sense,\u201d a pamphlet published in\n1776, was a very vigorous argument in favor of severing all ties with\nthe mother country. The argument was put so strongly, and at the same\ntime with such simplicity, that it made a great impression on all\nkinds of people, and the Pennsylvania legislature, in recognition of\nthe services he had rendered to the American cause, made him a gift\nof five hundred pounds. This pamphlet was immediately translated into\nvarious European languages. His \u201cCrisis,\u201d which was published from time\nto time during the war, was also of great importance to the Americans,\nand the first number was read by order of Washington to every regiment\nin the colonial army. This was in the terrible winter of 1776, and\nthe spirit and courage expressed in these papers did much to relieve\nthe despondency of the time. The \u201cAge of Reason,\u201d an attack on the\nBible, published in 1794, shocked the world, and so beclouded Paine\u2019s\nreputation that his great service to the country has been largely\noverlooked.\n\n\nBENJAMIN FRANKLIN\n\nIf one wanted to name three men who are in a supreme degree\nrepresentative of three leading American types, he would not go far\nastray if he named Franklin, Emerson, and Lincoln. Several years\nbefore the Revolution Hume described Franklin as \u201cThe First and indeed\nthe first great Man of Letters in America\u201d; and Dr. Johnson, in that\nmost delightful exploitation of ignorance and eloquence, \u201cTaxation No\nTyranny,\u201d described him as \u201ca master of mischief.\u201d Franklin was then\none of the foremost representatives of the colonists, and one of the\nmost ardent advocates of their claims. For thirty years Europe knew\nmore about him than any other man in America, not excepting Washington.\nHe was a Bostonian by birth, the son of a tallow chandler. He had a\ncasual contact with the Boston Latin School; but his formal education\nwas finished in his eleventh year, when he began to work as a general\nutility boy in his father\u2019s shop. He was fond of reading, and was\nfortunate enough to possess Bunyan\u2019s works, and a little later he was\nreading Robinson Crusoe and other works by Defoe, who undoubtedly had\ngreat influence on his style. His love of books inclined him to the\nprinter\u2019s trade, and his self-education went on rapidly. Another piece\nof good fortune was finding a volume of the Spectator. He has given a\nvery interesting account of his use of this classic of sound, clear\nEnglish prose, and has described its influence on his language and\nstyle. Then he read Xenophon\u2019s \u201cMemorabilia,\u201d which gave him a clear\nidea of the Socratic method of discussion. At the age of fifteen he was\nalready writing for the colonial press, contributing essays notable for\ntheir very sensible moralizing and their practical wisdom; for Franklin\nwas, and still is, the representative of American practical sagacity\nand commonsense.\n\n\nPOOR RICHARD\u2019S ALMANAC\n\nFame and fortune came to him with the publication of Poor Richard\u2019s\nAlmanac, which began in 1732 and was continued for a quarter of a\ncentury. These almanacs went into almost every house in America,\nand served not only as calendars, lists of events, warnings about\nthe weather, with doggerel verses, but furnished proverbs of a very\npractical character, and also margins on which all sorts of notes could\nbe written. \u201cKeep thy shop and thy shop will keep thee,\u201d is a good\nexample of \u201cPoor Richard\u2019s\u201d practical wisdom. His personal experience\nat home and abroad made Franklin in many ways the most conspicuous\nAmerican of his time. His industry is shown by the fact that his work\nfills a hundred and seven volumes. In this mass of writing, of greatest\nimportance is his Autobiography, which told the story of his life from\nhis childhood to his arrival in London in 1757. It is a straight,\nclear, unpretentious piece of writing, and, all things considered,\nmust be considered one of the most important original contributions to\nAmerican literature.\n\nFrom the painting by Gilbert Stuart Newton]\n\n\nJOHN WOOLMAN\n\nIf John Woolman\u2019s work had borne any resemblance to that of Jonathan\nEdwards, Charles Lamb would never have said of it, \u201cLearn Woolman\u2019s\nwork by heart.\u201d It was as far as possible removed from the Dantesque\nvigor of the Puritan preacher. Woolman was a Quaker, born in New\nJersey, with very few educational opportunities, but of a naturally\nreligious nature, and seemed early, though in a perfectly normal way,\nto have thought of the world as the creation of a great and benignant\nGod. Like many other naturally serious youths of his time, as of\nBunyan\u2019s time, he was sorely beset by a consciousness of sinfulness,\nwhich he expressed in terms that today seem morbid in their intensity.\nHe accused himself of offenses of which it is quite certain that\nhe was innocent; but he began very early to understand the gospel\nof love and to desire above everything else to live in complete\nharmony with the will of God. He was not satisfied, however, to do\nthis by simply obeying the law of righteousness or acquiescing in a\nwill which he could not oppose. He was eager to make his obedience\npositive and active; so he became one of the earliest antislavery men\nin the country, and one of the most ardent. His genius saved him from\nfanaticism; while his simple earnestness and his effective appeal to\nthe higher ideals of his auditors made him a persuasive speaker. He\nhated slavery; but he never attacked the slaveholder. His nature was\none of singular purity and harmony; and as he had no self-consciousness\nand no ambition, and writing was simply a means of expression, his\nnature got into his style. Although an illiterate Quaker, an English\ncritic declared that \u201cHe writes in a style of the most exquisite purity\nand grace.\u201d His Journal, which is considered one of the classics\nof early American literature, is an unaffected and intimate record\nof his thoughts, feelings, and experiences. It was begun in his\nthirty-seventh year. It is not in any sense great literature; but it is\nreal literature, and as contrasted with all the colonial writing, save\nthat of Edwards and Franklin, it stands out by reason of the purity of\nits style and the beauty of its feeling and thought.\n\nThe note of mystery was struck early in American writing, \u201cPeter Rugg,\u201d\nby William Austin, appearing in the New England Galaxy in 1824-1826.\n\n\nCHARLES BROCKDEN BROWN\n\nCharles Brockden Brown\u2019s stories were published still earlier; and\nhe is often spoken of as the predecessor of Hawthorne. Like Francis\nHopkinson, he was a Philadelphian, who studied law and made literature\nhis profession. His first novel, \u201cWieland, or The Transformation,\u201d was\na story of ventriloquism, very artificial, but skilful and interesting.\nThis was followed by a much more striking tale, \u201cEdgar Huntley,\u201d a\ntale of terror, which seemed to predict Poe, and this in turn by three\nor four other novels. Brown was an industrious man, and his activity\nextended into other fields. He published a number of pamphlets and\nsemiscientific treatises. His work had little permanent value. It was\nsentimental and unreal, and lacked art; but its morbid psychology and a\ncertain kind of intensity gave it popularity at the time.\n\n\nWASHINGTON IRVING\n\nAmerican literature in the strictest sense of the word really began\nin the city of New York with the publication of Washington Irving\u2019s\nKnickerbocker History of New York. New York was then the most\ncosmopolitan of all cities of the New World, as it was the largest.\nIt was a pleasant town of twenty-five thousand people, and it had\npicturesque traditions; for it was first settled by the Dutch, who had,\nin a way, taken possession of the Hudson River. They were followed\nin turn by the English, and still later there was a large influx of\nFrench Huguenots. When the Revolution broke out eighteen languages were\nalready spoken in the city of New York. It was natural, therefore,\nthat the literature of imagination, of humor, and of sentiment should\nfind a soil in the cosmopolitan society of the town; and Irving, who\nwas born in the year in which the British troops embarked for England,\nwho declined to go to college, as his brothers had gone, but read\nlaw and, probably with greater avidity, books of general literature,\nand was a lover of nature, had both the temperament and the taste to\nwrite gentle satire. He was a born observer and loiterer, a man who\nsaw and felt and meditated. He had the high spirit of youth, and when\nhe returned in 1806 from Europe he was still a young man, and there\nwere some other gifted young men in New York to keep him company. They\npublished anonymously a series of semi-humorous, satirical comments\non men, women, and things social, dramatic, and literary, under the\ntitle \u201cSalmagundi,\u201d and in these papers Irving\u2019s humor, sentiment,\nand delightful style were conspicuous. They were followed by the\nKnickerbocker History of New York, in which the audacious young man\nbroadly burlesqued the ancestors of some of the foremost people in New\nYork. It was good-natured; but it gave great offense. It was, however,\nthe first book of quality and feeling written by an American. In 1815\nIrving went to Europe a second time, and did not return until 1832.\nDuring that interval he published two books, which made a reputation\nfor him on both sides of the Atlantic, \u201cBracebridge Hall\u201d and \u201cThe\nSketch-Book.\u201d These books made the colonists, irritated by their long\ndiscussion with England, more tolerant of the mother country, because\nthey recalled places and customs that had been dear to their ancestors,\nor to their own youth. Thackeray called Irving \u201cthe first ambassador\nwhom the new world of letters sent to the old.\u201d\n\nThe center house is the home of Capt. James Lawrence]\n\nCooper\u2019s boyhood home]\n\n\nJAMES K. PAULDING\n\nOne of the most prominent members of the little company of young men\nsubsequently known as the Knickerbocker writers, who were all friends\nof Irving, was James K. Paulding, whose youth fell in the period of the\nRevolutionary War. In consequence he received very little education,\nbut had great vigor of mind and energy of character. He early became\nacquainted with Washington Irving, and a strong friendship grew up\nbetween them. Paulding was one of the contributors to the Salmagundi\npapers, and began early to write for various periodicals. His diverting\nhistory of \u201cJohn Bull and Brother Jonathan\u201d passed through many\neditions, and his satirical tendency made him popular at a time when\nthe feeling in this country against Great Britain was very strong.\nA pamphlet entitled \u201cThe United States and England,\u201d which appeared\nin 1814, secured political preferment for Paulding, and he was made\nsecretary to the first board of navy commissioners. A story published\nin 1831, \u201cThe Dutchman\u2019s Fireside,\u201d founded on an earlier description\nof the manners of the early Dutch settlers, was his most successful\nproduction, passing through six editions in a year, and being\nrepublished abroad and translated into several languages. Paulding\u2019s\ntalent, although genuine, was not distinctive enough to secure his\npermanent reputation; but he remains a very interesting figure in a\ngroup of delightful writers, and his early skits, if they may be so\ncalled, were very keen satirical comments on some offensive British\ntraits and qualities.\n\n\nJAMES FENIMORE COOPER\n\nDavid d\u2019Angers--1828]\n\nCooper, who was also a New Yorker, published \u201cThe Spy\u201d in 1821.\n\u201cPrecaution,\u201d his first effort in fiction, which had already appeared,\nwas a study of English society life, about which Cooper knew very\nlittle, and it was a failure. In \u201cThe Spy,\u201d Cooper knew his ground\nand his people. He had spent much of his boyhood at Cooperstown, in\ncentral New York, near the scene of much of the Indian fighting. He\nhad heard stories of adventure from Indian fighters and trappers. Many\nof the men who had fought in the American ranks during the War of the\nRevolution were still living. \u201cThe Spy\u201d was instantly popular, because\nit was the first really American novel written by an American. It dealt\nwith a very interesting character, Harvey Birch; and it appealed alike\nto the men who knew of the war from experience, and to those who had\nbeen brought up to revere the veterans of the Revolution. Europe, too,\nwas intensely curious about the Indian, and the stories that followed,\nespecially those in the Leather Stocking Tales, were translated into\nalmost every European tongue, and are still read in all parts of the\nOld World. Boys in remote German villages are still playing Cooper\u2019s\nIndians.\n\nCooper was a very uneven writer, careless, and indifferent about\nartistic effects. He was often diffuse and often commonplace, and he\nhad not much skill in drawing portraits of men and women; but he could\ntell a story rapidly and dramatically. He knew how to keep his readers\nin suspense, and he knew nature, both on land and at sea.\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY READING\n\n    INTRODUCTION TO AMERICAN LITERATURE        _By Henry S.

What\u2019s in the name? We might have chosen any one\nof fifty names beside The Mentor. We had a list of fully 100 names\nbefore we made our selection. And the material that we have supplied\nunder the name of \u201cMentor\u201d would have served its purpose as well\nunder another name. But we chose our name very carefully. There\u2019s a\nreason for \u201cMentor.\u201d And yet, although we are now a little over three\nyears old and number nearly 100,000 in membership, no one has asked\nthe reason--at least until a few weeks ago. Then one of our earliest\nmembers put the question, \u201cWhat or who is The Mentor?\u201d The question was\nslow in coming, but I am glad it is here, because the answer is worth\nwhile.\n\n\n\nMentor was a very worthy individual of ancient Greece. You can read\nabout him in Homer\u2019s \u201cOdyssey.\u201d He was the son of Alcimus and the\nfaithful friend of Ulysses (Odysseus). When Ulysses set forth on his\nlong wanderings, he consigned his household and his family, including\nhis son Telemachus to the care of his friend Mentor. So faithful was\nMentor in his attention to Telemachus and so serviceable to him in\nprecept and example that his name has now come to be used in the sense\nof a wise and trustworthy advisor--\u201ca wise and faithful guide and\nfriend\u201d as a modern dictionary phrases it.\n\n\n\nThe name of Mentor was brought down nearer to our time by the eminent\nFrench writer, philosopher, and churchman, Fenelon, archbishop of\nCambria. He lived in the time of the Grand Monarch, Louis XIV, and\nso wise and cultivated was he that the king made him tutor to his\ngrandson, the Duke of Burgundy, eldest son of the dauphin, and eventual\nheir to the throne. In the course of his tutorship, and for purposes of\ninstruction, Fenelon wrote several remarkable books--prose poems, in\ntheir way, but each having a distinct moral purpose either religious\nor political. In one of these, published in 1699, and entitled\n\u201cTelemaque,\u201d Fenelon recounts the adventures of the son of Ulysses in\nsearch of his father. It is a Utopian novel dealing with conditions of\nlife in an idealistic way, and hovering between dreams and realities.\nIts object was to educate the young Duke of Burgundy\u2019s mind to the\nhighest purposes of life as they should be regarded by royalty--to keep\nbefore his eyes the \u201cgreat and holy maxim that kings exist for the sake\nof their subjects, not subjects for the sake of kings.\u201d In this book\nthe character of \u201cMentor\u201d figures prominently. His aims are educational\nin a gentle, lofty way, his hope being, as he puts it himself, \u201cto\nchange the tastes and habits of the people.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt was more due to Fenelon\u2019s employment of the character of \u201cMentor\u201d\nthan to that of Homer, that the name \u201cMentor\u201d came into use as a modern\nword. \u201cMentor\u201d now stands for a wise instructor and a guide, but, first\nand foremost, a friend. The underlying principle of \u201cMentor\u201d is an\ninterest in the welfare and improvement of others, and the dominating\npurpose of his life is _service_ to others.\n\n\n\nSo for that reason we selected the name. And when we made the selection\nwe thought that we were the first to use the name in the field of\nperiodical publication. We lived in that illusion but a short time.\nScarcely six months had gone by before we learned anew the old lesson\nthat the world is small and that there are many active minds in it. One\nmorning a plain, unpretentious periodical came into our office bearing\non its front the title \u201cThe Mentor,\u201d and with it came a friendly\nletter of greeting from its editor. The place of publication was the\nCharlestown Jail, and the object of the periodical was to reflect in\nprose and verse the daily life of the occupants of that quiet and\nsecure retreat. The editor extended his greetings to me and asked me if\nI would exchange with him--not positions, but periodicals. The request\nwas readily granted, and, as a result, we are now thoroughly informed\nof the affairs of that substantial institution of Charlestown, and we\nare carrying our message of information twice a month to the members of\nthe exclusive community located there.\n\nEDITOR]\n\n\n\n\nTHE MENTOR ASSOCIATION\n\n\nESTABLISHED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A POPULAR INTEREST IN ART,\nLITERATURE, SCIENCE, HISTORY, NATURE, AND TRAVEL\n\nTHE ADVISORY BOARD\n\n  JOHN G.
