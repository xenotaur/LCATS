furthermore in the temple were\nFul many a thousand louers here & there\nIn sondry wyse redy to compleyne\nVnto the goddesse, of her woo and peyne\nHow they were hyndred som for enuye\nAnd how the

wil god don so grete a cruelte\nTo ony man, or to his creature\nTo make hym so muche woo endure\nFor her, percas, whom he shal in no wyse\nReioyse neuer, but so fort[=h] in Iuyse\nLede his lif til that he be graue\nFor he ne durst of hir no mercy craue\nAnd eke [per]aunter thoug[=h] he durst & wolde\nHe can not wite where he hir fynd sholde\nI sawe ther eke, and therof had I couthe\nThat som were hyndred by couetyse & slougthe\nAnd so[=m]e also for their hastynes\nAnd other eke for their rechelesnes\nBut altherlast as I walked and behelde\nBeside pallas wit[=h] her Cristal sheld\nTofore the statue of venus set on height\nTher kneled a lady in my sight\nTo fore the goddesse, whiche as the sonne\nPasset[=h] the sterris, and eke the stormys donne\nAnd lucifer to voyde the nyghtes sorowe\n\nIn clerenes passet[=h] erly the morowe\nAnd so as maye hat[=h] the souereynte\nOf euery monet[=h] the fayrnes and beaute\nAnd as the rose in swetnes and odour\nSurmounted flouris, and baine

ensumyned enuyron\nAnd forto speke of her condicion\nShe was the beste that might be on lyue\nFor ther was none [that] wit[=h] her might stryue\nTo speke of bounte or of gentilesse\nOf womanhede or of lowlynesse\nOf curtoysie or of goodlihede\nOf speche of chere or of semelihede\nOf poort benigne or of daliaunce\nThe best taught and therto of playsaunce\nShe was the welle eke of honeste\nAn Examplair and mirrour eke was she\nOf secretnes of trouthe of feit[=h]fulnes\nAnd to alle other lady and maistres\nTo shewe vertu who so list to lere\nAnd so this lady right humble of chere\nKneling I sawe, clad in grene and whyte\n\nTo fore venus goddesse of al delyte\nEnbrowded al wit[=h] stones and perre\nSo richely that Ioye it was to see\nWit[=h] sondry rolles on her garnement\nFor texpowne

said agayn, lady that maist restore\nHertes in Ioye from theyr aduersite\nTo do your wil de mieulx en mieulx ma gree\n\nThus euer slepyng dremyng as I laye\nWit[=h]yn the temple me thought I saye\nGrete prees of folk wit[=h] murmur wonderful\nTo croude and shoue, the temple was so ful\nEueric[=h] ful besy, in his owne cause\nThat I ne may shortly in a clause\nDiscriuen alle the rites and the guyse\nAnd eke I wante connyng to deuyse\nHow so[=m]e ther were wit[=h] blood, encence & milk\nAnd so[=m]e wit[=h] flouris sote & softe as silk\nAnd so[=m]e wit[=h] sparowes & douues whyte\nThat for to offren gan hem delyte\nVnto the goddesse wit[=h] sighe and prayer\nHem to relese of that they most desire\nThat for the prees shortly to conclude\nI wente my way for the multitude\nMe for to refress[=h] out of the prees allone\nAnd by my self me thought as I gan gone\nWit[=h] in the estres and gan a whyle tarye\nI sawe a man that walked al solitarye\nThat as me semed for heuynes and dole\nHym to compleyne, that he walked so sole\nWit[=h] oute espyyng of ony other wight\n\nAnd yf I s[=h]al diseryuen hym a right\nYf that he had not ben in heuynes\nMe thought he was, to speke of semelines\nOf shap of fourme, and also of stature\nThe most passing, that euer yet nature\nMade in her werkes, and lyke to be a man\nAnd ther wit[=h] al as I reherce can\nOf face and chere the most gracyous\nTo be biloued happy and ewrous\nBur as it semed outward by his chere\nThat he complayned for lack of his desire\nFor by hym self as he walked vp and doun\nI herde hym make a lamentacion\nAnd said alas, what thing may this be\nThat now am bonde that whylom was fre\nAnd wente at large at myn election\nNow am I caught vnder subiection\nFor to become a beray homager\nTo god of loue, wher er I cam here\nFelt in myn herte, nought of loues peyne\nBut now of newe, wit[=h]in hur firy cheyne\nI am embraced so that I may not stryue\nTo serue and loue whyle I am on lyue\n\nThe godly freshe in the temple yonder\nI sawe right now, that I had wonder\nHow euer god, for to rekene a[=ll]\nMight make a thing so celestia[=ll]\nSo angelike on erthe to appere\nFor wit[=h] the stremes of her eyen
