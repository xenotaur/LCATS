He set his near-empty\ndrink--a Bacardi martini--on the mantel and waddled out of the room\ntoward the basement.\n\nI sat in my big leather chair, feeling very peaceful with the world,\nwatching the fire. Whatever Farnsworth would have to show to-night\nwould be far more entertaining than watching T.V.--my custom on other\nevenings. Farnsworth, with his four labs in the house and his very\ntricky mind, never failed to provide my best night of the week.\n\nWhen he returned, after a moment, he had with him a small box, about\nthree inches square. He held this carefully in one hand and stood by\nthe fireplace dramatically--or as dramatically as a very small, very\nfat man with pink cheeks can stand by a fireplace of the sort that\nseems to demand a big man with tweeds, pipe and, perhaps, a saber\nwound.\n\nAnyway, he held the box dramatically and he said, \"Last week, I was\nplaying around in the chem lab, trying to make a new kind of rubber\neraser. Did quite well with the other drafting equipment, you know,\nespecially the dimensional curve and the photosensitive ink. Well, I\napproached the job by trying for a material that would absorb graphite\nwithout abrading paper.\"\n\nI was a little disappointed with this; it sounded pretty tame. But I\nsaid, \"How did it come out?\"\n\n\n\nHe screwed his pudgy face up thoughtfully. \"Synthesized the material,\nall right, and it seems to work, but the interesting thing is that it\nhas a certain--ah--secondary property that would make it quite awkward\nto use. Interesting property, though. Unique, I am inclined to\nbelieve.\"\n\nThis began to sound more like it. \"And what property is that?\" I\npoured myself a shot of straight rum from the bottle sitting on the\ntable beside me. I did not like straight rum, but I preferred it to\nFarnsworth's rather imaginative cocktails.\n\n\"I'll show you, John,\" he said. He opened the box and I could see that\nit was packed with some kind of batting. He fished in this and\nwithdrew a gray ball about the size of a golfball and set the box on\nthe mantel.\n\n\"And that's the--eraser?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. Then he squatted down, held the ball about a half-inch\nfrom the floor, dropped it.\n\nIt bounced, naturally enough. Then it bounced again. And again. Only\nthis was not natural, for on the second bounce the ball went higher in\nthe air than on the first, and on the third bounce higher still. After\na half minute, my eyes were bugging out and the little ball was\nbouncing four feet in the air and going higher each time.\n\nI grabbed my glass. \"What the hell!\" I said.\n\nFarnsworth caught the ball in a pudgy hand and held it. He was smiling\na little sheepishly. \"Interesting effect, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Now wait a minute,\" I said, beginning to think about it. \"What's the\ngimmick? What kind of motor do you have in that thing?\"\n\nHis eyes were wide and a little hurt. \"No gimmick, John. None at all.\nJust a very peculiar molecular structure.\"\n\n\"Structure!\" I said. \"Bouncing balls just don't pick up energy out of\nnowhere, I don't care how their molecules are put together. And you\ndon't get energy out without putting energy in.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"that's the really interesting thing. Of course you're\nright; energy _does_ go into the ball. Here, I'll show you.\"\n\nHe let the ball drop again and it began bouncing, higher and higher,\nuntil it was hitting the ceiling. Farnsworth reached out to catch it,\nbut he fumbled and the thing glanced off his hand, hit the mantelpiece\nand zipped across the room. It banged into the far wall, richocheted,\nbanked off three other walls, picking up speed all the time.\n\nWhen it whizzed by me like a rifle bullet, I began to get worried, but\nit hit against one of the heavy draperies by the window and this\ndamped its motion enough so that it fell to the floor.\n\n\n\nIt started bouncing again immediately, but Farnsworth scrambled across\nthe room and grabbed it. He was perspiring a little and he began\ninstantly to transfer the ball from one hand to another and back again\nas if it were hot.\n\n\"Here,\" he said, and handed it to me.\n\nI almost dropped it.\n\n\"It's like a ball of ice!\" I said. \"Have you been keeping it in the\nrefrigerator?\"\n\n\"No. As a matter of fact, it was at room temperature a few minutes\nago.\"\n\n\"Now wait a minute,\" I said. \"I only teach physics in high school, but\nI know better than that. Moving around in warm air doesn't make\nanything cold except by evaporation.\"\n\n\"Well, there's your input and output, John,\" he said. \"The ball lost\nheat and took on motion. Simple conversion.\"\n\nMy jaw must have dropped to my waist. \"Do you mean that that little\nthing is converting heat to kinetic energy?\"\n\n\"Apparently.\"\n\n\"But that's impossible!\"\n\nHe was beginning to smile thoughtfully. The ball was not as cold now\nas it had been and I was holding it in my lap.\n\n\"A steam engine does it,\" he said, \"and a steam turbine. Of course,\nthey're not very efficient.\"\n\n\"They work mechanically, too, and only because water expands when it\nturns to steam.\"\n\n\"This seems to do it differently,\" he said, sipping thoughtfully at\nhis dark-brown martini. \"I don't know exactly how--maybe something\npiezo-electric about the way its molecules slide about. I ran some\ntests--measured its impact energy in foot pounds and compared that\nwith the heat loss in BTUs. Seemed to be about 98 per cent efficient,\nas close as I could tell. Apparently it converts heat into bounce very\nwell. Interesting, isn't it?\"\n\n\"_Interesting?_\" I almost came flying out of my chair. My mind was\nbeginning to spin like crazy. \"If you're not pulling my leg with this\nthing, Farnsworth, you've got something by the tail there that's just\na little bit bigger than the discovery of fire.\"\n\nHe blushed modestly. \"I'd rather thought that myself,\" he admitted.\n\n\"Good Lord, look at the heat that's available!\" I said, getting really\nexcited now.\n\n\n\nFarnsworth was still smiling, very pleased with himself. \"I suppose\nyou could put this thing in a box, with convection fins, and let it\nbounce around inside--\"\n\n\"I'm way ahead of you,\" I said. \"But that wouldn't work. All your\nkinetic energy would go right back to heat, on impact--and eventually\nthat little ball would build up enough speed to blast its way through\nany box you could build.\"\n\n\"Then how would you work it?\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, choking down the rest of my rum, \"you'd seal the ball\nin a big steel cylinder, attach the cylinder to a crankshaft and\nflywheel, give the thing a shake to start the ball bouncing back and\nforth, and let it run like a gasoline engine or something. It would\nget all the heat it needed from the air in a normal room. Mount the\napparatus in your house and it would pump your water, operate a\ngenerator and keep you cool at the same time!\"\n\nI sat down again, shakily, and began pouring myself another drink.\n\nFarnsworth had taken the ball from me and was carefully putting it\nback in its padded box. He was visibly showing excitement, too; I\ncould see that his cheeks were ruddier and his eyes even brighter than\nnormal. \"But what if you want the cooling and don't have any work to\nbe done?\"\n\n\"Simple,\" I said. \"You just let the machine turn a flywheel or lift\nweights and drop them, or something like that, outside your house. You\nhave an air intake inside. And if, in the winter, you don't want to\nlose heat, you just mount the thing in an outside building, attach it\nto your generator and use the power to do whatever you want--heat your\nhouse, say. There's plenty of heat in the outside air even in\nDecember.\"\n\n\"John,\" said Farnsworth, \"you are very ingenious. It might work.\"\n\n\"Of course it'll work.\" Pictures were beginning to light up in my\nhead. \"And don't you realize that this is the answer to the solar\npower problem? Why, mirrors and selenium are, at best, ten per cent\nefficient! Think of big pumping stations on the Sahara! All that heat,\nall that need for power, for irrigation!\" I paused a moment for\neffect. \"Farnsworth, this can change the very shape of the Earth!\"\n\nFarnsworth seemed to be lost in thought. Finally he looked at me\nstrangely and said, \"Perhaps we had better try to build a model.\"\n\n\n\nI was so excited by the thing that I couldn't sleep that night. I kept\ndreaming of power stations, ocean liners, even automobiles, being\noperated by balls bouncing back and forth in cylinders.\n\nI even worked out a spaceship in my mind, a bullet-shaped affair with\na huge rubber ball on its end, gyroscopes to keep it oriented\nproperly, the ball serving as solution to that biggest of\nmissile-engineering problems, excess heat. You'd build a huge concrete\nlaunching field, supported all the way down to bedrock, hop in the\nship and start bouncing. Of course it would be kind of a rough\nride....\n\nIn the morning, I called my superintendent and told him to get a\nsubstitute for the rest of the week; I was going to be busy.\n\nThen I started working in the machine shop in Farnsworth's basement,\ntrying to turn out a working model of a device that, by means of a\ncrankshaft, oleo dampers and a reciprocating cylinder, would pick up\nsome of that random kinetic energy from the bouncing ball and do\nsomething useful with it, like turning a drive shaft. I was just\nworking out a convection-and-air pump system for circulating hot air\naround the ball when Farnsworth came in.\n\nHe had tucked carefully under his arm a sphere of about the size of a\nbasketball and, if he had made it to my specifications, weighing\nthirty-five pounds. He had a worried frown on his forehead.\n\n\"It looks good,\" I said. \"What's the trouble?\"\n\n\"There seems to be a slight hitch,\" he said. \"I've been testing for\nconductivity. It seems to be quite low.\"\n\n\"That's what I'm working on now. It's just a mechanical problem of\npumping enough warm air back to the ball. We can do it with no more\nthan a twenty per cent efficiency loss. In an engine, that's nothing.\"\n\n\"Maybe you're right. But this material conducts heat even less than\nrubber does.\"\n\n\"The little ball yesterday didn't seem to have any trouble,\" I said.\n\n\"Naturally not. It had had plenty of time to warm up before I started\nit. And its mass-surface area relationship was pretty low--the larger\nyou make a sphere, of course, the more mass inside in proportion to\nthe outside area.\"\n\n\"You're right, but I think we can whip it. We may have to honeycomb\nthe ball and have part of the work the machine does operate a big hot\nair pump; but we can work it out.\"\n\n\n\nAll that day, I worked with lathe, milling machine and hacksaw. After\nclamping the new big ball securely to a workbench, Farnsworth pitched\nin to help me. But we weren't able to finish by nightfall and\nFarnsworth turned his spare bedroom over to me for the night. I was\ntoo tired to go home.\n\nAnd too tired to sleep soundly, too. Farnsworth lived on the edge of\nSan Francisco, by a big truck by-pass, and almost all night I wrestled\nwith the pillow and sheets, listening half-consciously to those heavy\ntrucks rumbling by, and in my mind, always, that little gray ball,\nbouncing and bouncing and bouncing....\n\nAt daybreak, I came abruptly fully awake with the sound of crashing\nechoing in my ears, a battering sound that seemed to come from the\nbasement. I grabbed my coat and pants, rushed out of the room, almost\nknocked over Farnsworth, who was struggling to get his shoes on out in\nthe hall, and we scrambled down the two flights of stairs together.\n\nThe place was a chaos, battered and bashed equipment everywhere, and\non the floor, overturned against the far wall, the table that the ball\nhad been clamped to. The ball itself was gone.\n\nI had not been fully asleep all night, and the sight of that mess, and\nwhat it meant, jolted me immediately awake. Something, probably a\nheavy truck, had started a tiny oscillation in that ball. And the ball\nhad been heavy enough to start the table bouncing with it until, by\ndancing that table around the room, it had literally torn the clamp\noff and shaken itself free. What had happened afterward was obvious,\nwith the ball building up velocity with every successive bounce.\n\nBut where was the ball now?\n\nSuddenly Farnsworth cried out hoarsely, \"Look!\" and I followed his\noutstretched, pudgy finger to where, at one side of the basement, a\nwindow had been broken open--a small window, but plenty big enough for\nsomething the size of a basketball to crash through it.\n\nThere was a little weak light coming from outdoors. And then I saw the\nball. It was in Farnsworth's back yard, bouncing a little sluggishly\non the grass. The grass would damp it, hold it back, until we could\nget to it. Unless....\n\nI took off up the basement steps like a streak. Just beyond the back\nyard, I had caught a glimpse of something that frightened me. A few\nyards from where I had seen the ball was the edge of the big six-lane\nhighway, a broad ribbon of smooth, hard concrete.\n\nI got through the house to the back porch, rushed out and was in the\nback yard just in time to see the ball take its first bounce onto\nthe concrete. I watched it, fascinated, when it hit--after the soft,\nenergy absorbing turf, the concrete was like a springboard.\nImmediately the ball flew high in the air. I was running across the\nyard toward it, praying under my breath, _Fall on that grass next\ntime_.\n\nIt hit before I got to it, and right on the concrete again, and this\ntime I saw it go straight up at least fifty feet.\n\n\n\nMy mind was suddenly full of thoughts of dragging mattresses from the\nhouse, or making a net or something to stop that hurtling thirty-five\npounds; but I stood where I was, unable to move, and saw it come down\nagain on the highway. It went up a hundred feet. And down again on the\nconcrete, about fifteen feet further down the road. In the direction\nof the city.\n\nThat time it was two hundred feet, and when it hit again, it made a\nthud that you could have heard for a quarter of a mile. I could\npractically see it flatten out on the road before it took off upward\nagain, at twice the speed it had hit at.\n\nSuddenly generating an idea, I whirled and ran back to Farnsworth's\nhouse. He was standing in the yard now, shivering from the morning\nair, looking at me like a little lost and badly scared child.\n\n\"Where are your car keys?\" I almost shouted at him.\n\n\"In my pocket.\"\n\n\"Come on!\"\n\nI took him by the arm and half dragged him to the carport. I got the\nkeys from him, started the car, and by mangling about seven traffic\nlaws and three prize rosebushes, managed to get on the highway, facing\nin the direction that the ball was heading.\n\n\"Look,\" I said, trying to drive down the road and search for the ball\nat the same time. \"It's risky, but if I can get the car under it and\nwe can hop out in time, it should crash through the roof. That ought\nto slow it down enough for us to nab it.\"\n\n\"But--what about my car?\" Farnsworth bleated.\n\n\"What about that first building--or first person--it hits in San\nFrancisco?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" he said. \"Hadn't thought of that.\"\n\nI slowed the car and stuck my head out the window. It was lighter now,\nbut no sign of the ball. \"If it happens to get to town--any town, for\nthat matter--it'll be falling from about ten or twenty miles. Or\nforty.\"\n\n\"Maybe it'll go high enough first so that it'll burn. Like a meteor.\"\n\n\"No chance,\" I said. \"Built-in cooling system, remember?\"\n\nFarnsworth formed his mouth into an \"Oh\" and exactly at that moment\nthere was a resounding _thump_ and I saw the ball hit in a field,\nmaybe twenty yards from the edge of the road, and take off again. This\ntime it didn't seem to double its velocity, and I figured the ground\nwas soft enough to hold it back--but it wasn't slowing down either,\nnot with a bounce factor of better than two to one.\n\n\n\nWithout watching for it to go up, I drove as quickly as I could off\nthe road and over--carrying part of a wire fence with me--to where it\nhad hit. There was no mistaking it; there was a depression about three\nfeet deep, like a small crater.\n\nI jumped out of the car and stared up. It took me a few seconds to\nspot it, over my head. One side caught by the pale and slanting\nmorning sunlight, it was only a bright diminishing speck.\n\nThe car motor was running and I waited until the ball disappeared for\na moment and then reappeared. I watched for another couple of seconds\nuntil I felt I could make a decent guess on its direction, hollered at\nFarnsworth to get out of the car--it had just occurred to me that\nthere was no use risking his life, too--dove in and drove a hundred\nyards or so to the spot I had anticipated.\n\nI stuck my head out the window and up. The ball was the size of an egg\nnow. I adjusted the car's position, jumped out and ran for my life.\n\nIt hit instantly after--about sixty feet from the car. And at the same\ntime, it occurred to me that what I was trying to do was completely\nimpossible. Better to hope that the ball hit a pond, or bounced out to\nsea, or landed in a sand dune. All we could do would be to follow, and\nif it ever was damped down enough, grab it.\n\nIt had hit soft ground and didn't double its height that time, but it\nhad still gone higher. It was out of sight for almost a lifelong\nminute.\n\nAnd then--incredibly rotten luck--it came down, with an ear-shattering\nthwack, on the concrete highway again. I had seen it hit, and\ninstantly afterward I saw a crack as wide as a finger open along the\nentire width of the road. And the ball had flown back up like a\nrocket.\n\n_My God_, I was thinking, _now it means business. And on the next\nbounce...._\n\nIt seemed like an incredibly long time that we craned our necks,\nFarnsworth and I, watching for it to reappear in the sky. And when it\nfinally did, we could hardly follow it. It whistled like a bomb and we\nsaw the gray streak come plummeting to Earth almost a quarter of a\nmile away from where we were standing.\n\nBut we didn't see it go back up again.\n\nFor a moment, we stared at each other silently. Then Farnsworth almost\nwhispered, \"Perhaps it's landed in a pond.\"\n\n\"Or in the world's biggest cow-pile,\" I said. \"Come on!\"\n\nWe could have met our deaths by rock salt and buckshot that night, if\nthe farmer who owned that field had been home. We tore up everything\nwe came to getting across it--including cabbages and rhubarb. But we\nhad to search for ten minutes, and even then we didn't find the ball.\n\nWhat we found was a hole in the ground that could have been a\nsmall-scale meteor crater. It was a good twenty feet deep. But at the\nbottom, no ball.\n\n\n\nI stared wildly at it for a full minute before I focused my eyes\nenough to see, at the bottom, a thousand little gray fragments.\n\nAnd immediately it came to both of us at the same time. A poor\nconductor, the ball had used up all its available heat on that final\nimpact. Like a golfball that has been dipped in liquid air and\ndropped, it had smashed into thin splinters.\n\nThe hole had sloping sides and I scrambled down in it and picked up\none of the pieces, using my handkerchief, folded--there was no telling\njust how cold it would be.\n\nIt was the stuff, all right. And colder than an icicle.\n\nI climbed out. \"Let's go home,\" I said.\n\nFarnsworth looked at me thoughtfully. Then he sort of cocked his head\nto one side and asked, \"What do you suppose will happen when those\npieces thaw?\"\n\nI stared at him. I began to think of a thousand tiny slivers whizzing\naround erratically, richocheting off buildings, in downtown San\nFrancisco and in twenty counties, and no matter what they hit, moving\nand accelerating as long as there was any heat in the air to give them\nenergy.\n\nAnd then I saw a tool shed, on the other side of the pasture from us.\n\nBut Farnsworth was ahead of me, waddling along, puffing. He got the\nshovels out and handed one to me.\n\nWe didn't say a word, neither of us, for hours. It takes a long time\nto fill a hole twenty feet deep--especially when you're shoveling\nvery, very carefully and packing down the dirt very, very hard.\n\n    --WALTER S. TEVIS",
