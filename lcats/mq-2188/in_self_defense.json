Tuttle\n\nAuthor of \u201cFor the Love of Annibel,\u201d \u201cAll Wool,\u201d etc.\n\n\n\u201cProhibition,\u201d remarked Ike Harper, loosening up a notch in his belt\nand rolling a fresh smoke, \u201cis goin\u2019 to make two roses bloom in this\ncountry where only one bloomed before. \u2019Cause why? One drink uh\nbootleg hooch will bring blossoms to th\u2019 face of uh wooden Injun,\nand also it\u2019s goin\u2019 to work uh hardship on real old maids and homely\nfemales of all descriptions. Lissen, and I\u2019ll orate how I knows.\u201d\n\n               *       *       *       *       *\n\nRen Merton was uh trouble-huntin\u2019 fool of uh puncher, and Sig Watson\nwas his first assistant. I might say that Sig was his aid-de-camp,\nsecretary and treasurer. Them two hombres punched cows fer uh livin\u2019\nand hunted trouble fer pastime.\n\nIf th\u2019 combined brains of th\u2019 two was turned to powder and put into\nuh .22 ca\u2019tridge shell it wouldn\u2019t blow th\u2019 bullet out of uh\nsix-inch pistol barrel, and if it was black powder it wouldn\u2019t foul\nth\u2019 shell.\n\nThey punched fer th\u2019 Triangle outfit all one summer, and then\ndecides to go into th\u2019 cattle business fer themselves. Not havin\u2019\nsaved enough between \u2019em to buy uh green hide, they decides to go\ninto th\u2019 business anyway.\n\nMagpie Simpkins was th\u2019 sheriff at th\u2019 time and, havin\u2019 uh real\nfriendly feelin\u2019 fer th\u2019 boys, he don\u2019t arrest \u2019em a-tall. He jist\nshoots th\u2019 hot cinch ring out of Ren\u2019s hand, cuts th\u2019 heifer loose\nand fergets th\u2019 whole affair.\n\nThey rides back to town, where Ren gits prodigal with his six-gun\nammunition, with th\u2019 result that th\u2019 atmosphere gits too warm fer\ncomfort, and they grabs their hosses and fogs off to th\u2019 Seven A\nranch and go to work again.\n\nWell, fer th\u2019 next month they behaves fine--said month bein\u2019 spent\non th\u2019 roundup out in th\u2019 Sweetgrass hills, so far from town that it\ntakes two days hard ridin\u2019 to find anything except personal\nanimosities, which ain\u2019t sufficient.\n\nTh\u2019 nearest town is Piperock. Piperock ain\u2019t what you\u2019d call uh\nthrivin\u2019 city--not havin\u2019 uh Chamber of Commerce or an Ad Club, but\nshe manages to angle along anyway. It contains about uh hundred\nhuman beings and a Greaser settlement.\n\nWell, as I said before, Ren and Sig works steady fer uh while and\nthen collects their stipend, rolls their war-sacks and moseys to\ntown to revel amid th\u2019 bright lights and enjoy th\u2019 fruits of their\nlabor.\n\nThey says \u201cKlahowya\u201d to Buck Masterson, th\u2019 saloon keeper, and\nproceeds to pay rent on th\u2019 saloon fixtures.\n\n\u201cBoys,\u201d says Buck, \u201ccurb yore feelin\u2019s fer this time. There\u2019s uh\nheap uh sentiment agin\u2019 yuh both here, and if yuh behave it\u2019s bound\nto die out in uh little while. That Chink is still in th\u2019 hospital\nat Helena.\u201d\n\n\u201cPshaw!\u201d exclaims Ren. \u201cThat\u2019s too danged bad. But I asks yuh, Buck,\nhow was I to know that th\u2019 Chink was behind that box, too? That\nGreaser ducks behind it and I never once thinks that there\u2019s room\nfer two people. It surprises me so I lets th\u2019 Greaser git away.\u201d\n\n\u201cI allus told yuh,\u201d stated Sig, \u201cthat you depends too much on th\u2019\njump of that ol\u2019 .41. Now, uh .45 is heavy enough that she don\u2019t\njump. To illustrate my point clearly----\u201d\n\nRight then Buck cuts in and talks \u2019em out of it. Uh six-gun\ndemonstration ain\u2019t no pink tea, especially when th\u2019 demonstrator\nhas about six scoops uh hooch under his belt.\n\nThey has a few more drinks and then decides to eat, so they ambles\nacross th\u2019 street to Jimmy Peyton\u2019s Boston Chop House, th\u2019 only\neatin\u2019 place in th\u2019 town. There ain\u2019t nobody in sight, so Ren\nyells--\n\n\u201cJimmy, yuh lop-eared son-of-uh-sea-cook, bring us uh meenoo!\u201d\n\nRight then they gits uh surprise. Instead of Jimmy, with his dirty\napron and a half-smoked cigaret hangin\u2019 out uh one side of his\nmouth, out waltzes th\u2019 swellest lookin\u2019 female person they ever saw,\nand she single-foots right up to \u2019em with uh smile, and then out\ncomes another she person, but this last one ain\u2019t noways in th\u2019 same\nclass as Number One.\n\nThey\u2019re both wearin\u2019 li\u2019l dinky white aprons and uh head full uh\nhair, but here th\u2019 similarity ceases some abrupt. Th\u2019 first one is\npackin\u2019 class by th\u2019 ton. She\u2019s--well, she looks uh lot like th\u2019\nlady on th\u2019 Empire Packin\u2019 Company\u2019s calendar, which ol\u2019 man Padden\nhas hangin\u2019 over his bunk.\n\nTh\u2019 other is older by twenty years and seems sort-a sprung in th\u2019\nknees. She\u2019s got uh forearm like Jefferies and needs uh shave. Th\u2019\nfirst one leans over th\u2019 table and hands uh printed bill uh fare,\nbut Ren don\u2019t read it a-tall. He says, \u201cThanks, ma\u2019am,\u201d and puts it\nin his pocket.\n\nTh\u2019 older one grins at Sig and says, \u201cNice day.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d agrees Sig. \u201cIt shore is. Don\u2019t hardly look like it might\nrain.\u201d\n\nRen just sits there lookin\u2019 at th\u2019 pretty one, like uh chickadee\nlookin\u2019 at uh rattler. He ain\u2019t able to even wink.\n\n\u201cSoup?\u201d asks th\u2019 lady.\n\n\u201cAre we?\u201d asks Ren, turnin\u2019 to Sig, who is also industriously sizin\u2019\nup th\u2019 beauty show.\n\n\u201cIntensely,\u201d agrees Sig, and th\u2019 two females beat it fer th\u2019\nkitchen.\n\n\u201cDo you gentlemen live here?\u201d asks th\u2019 pretty one, when she deposits\nth\u2019 soup on th\u2019 table.\n\n\u201cWe--huh--yes\u2019m I reckon yuh might say we do,\u201d stammers Ren, tryin\u2019\nto eat soup with his fork and keep both hands out of sight.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t usually live here,\u201d amended Sig. \u201cBut we can. You livin\u2019\nhere?\u201d\n\nTh\u2019 other female has jist come out of th\u2019 kitchen and she answers:\n\n\u201cMy cousin and I bought this place a week ago from Mr. Peyton. I am\nMiss Matilda Beebee, and my cousin here is Miss Rosalind Madeline\nMcGuire.\u201d\n\nRen spilt his soup gittin\u2019 up and reaches out his hand.\n\n\u201cPleased to meet yuh,\u201d says he, sayin\u2019 th\u2019 same thing to both of\nthem. \u201cI\u2019m Sigismund Alexander Watson, and my friend here is Ren\nMerton.\u201d\n\n\u201cChristened,\u201d says Ren, \u201cRenley St. Clair Merton. I welcomes yuh to\nPiperock.\u201d\n\n\u201cRen,\u201d says Sig, when they had managed to tear themselves away from\nth\u2019 eatin\u2019 house, \u201cwhere did you git that l-e-y on Ren, and also\nthat St. Clair?\u201d\n\n\u201cSlick-eared \u2019em,\u201d grinned Ren, \u201cjist like you did i-s-m-u-n-d and\nAlexander. Do you think fer uh minute that I eats dust from any\nbow-legged cow trailer when it comes to names? Not a-tall. Sabe?\u201d\n\n\u201cSome filly!\u201d states Sig. \u201cMama mine! Some filly!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re goin\u2019 to have preachin\u2019 tonight in Piperock,\u201d states Buck, as\nhe slides th\u2019 poison vial down th\u2019 bar to th\u2019 boys.\n\n\u201cWhat for is this preachin\u2019?\u201d asks Ren. \u201cSomebody dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope. Jist common Gospel. I figgers to take one of th\u2019 girls across\nth\u2019 street.\u201d\n\n\u201cAsked her yet?\u201d asks Sig, with uh grin.\n\nBuck polished off the bar and replaced the bottles before he\nreplied--\n\n\u201cNope--not yet.\u201d\n\nThey imbibes their drinks and wanders out on th\u2019 porch.\n\n\u201cDog-gone!\u201d exclaims Sig. \u201cI reckon I leaves my quirt over to th\u2019\nrestaurant. Better go and git it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTh\u2019 walk will do us good,\u201d grins Ren. \u201cCome on.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuirt?\u201d asks th\u2019 pretty one. \u201cOh yes, you mean that thing hangin\u2019\non your wrist don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI--I reckon I plumb overlooked it,\u201d stammers Sig. \u201cMuch obliged.\u201d\n\n\u201cI jist come over, ma\u2019am,\u201d says Ren, \u201cto see if you\u2019d go to th\u2019\nGospel meetin\u2019 with me tonight.\u201d He looks up and he\u2019s gazin\u2019 into\nth\u2019 eyes of Matilda Beebee.\n\n\u201cCharmed,\u201d says Matilda. \u201cYore pardner, Mr. Watson, might care to go\nwith Rosalind.\u201d\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d chuckles Sig, \u201cI takes off my hat to you as uh mind reader.\nThat lost quirt was jist an excuse to git over here, Sabe? I agreed\nto let Ren have first choice, ma\u2019am, and yuh shore can depend on Ren\nto make no mistakes on th\u2019 draw. Why I\u2019ve seen that _hombre_ discard\none small pair to git uh chance to----\u201d\n\n\u201cSig,\u201d says Ren sort-a hard like, \u201cif we\u2019re goin\u2019 to church we\u2019d\nbetter stable them broncs.\u201d\n\nAnd when he gits Sig outside he continues:\n\n\u201cYou dog-goned, ossified, bow-legged, paralytic son of-- Sig, what\ndid I ever do to you, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cHaw! Haw! Haw!\u201d roared Sig, leanin against his horse and laughin\u2019\nso hard he almost pushes th\u2019 bronc off its feet. \u201cMama mine, Renley,\nwhen it comes to pickin\u2019 \u2019em yo\u2019re there! \u2018Charmed,\u2019 says she and\nyore face looked like you\u2019d been caught stealin\u2019 uh sheep.\u201d\n\nWell, they takes th\u2019 gentle sex to th\u2019 meetin\u2019, which is held in th\u2019\nold Mint dance hall, and, while Sig sits there and smiles into\nRosalind\u2019s face like uh dyin\u2019 calf in uh mud-hole, and gittin\u2019 hated\nfluently by th\u2019 male portion of Piperock, pore old Ren is fidgitin\u2019\nalongside uh Matilda. Yuh could light uh match on his ears every\ntime he hears anybody clear their throat, and it shore did seem as\nthough every one in church had uh frog in their throats.\n\nAfter th\u2019 preacher gives th\u2019 crowd th\u2019 exit sign, Ren sort-a stalls\naround with Matilda and lets th\u2019 crowd drift out ahead. Th\u2019\npreacher, bein\u2019 uh stranger, shakes hands with Ren and asks his\nname.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d says he. \u201cAnd this is Mrs. Merton. Well, well, I shore am\npleased. May I call?\u201d\n\n\u201cShore,\u201d grunts Ren, \u201cWhat yuh got?\u201d\n\n\u201cHa, ha!\u201d laughs th\u2019 preacher. \u201cMen will have their little jokes,\nMrs. Merton. You see I understand a few poker terms. Ha, ha!\u201d\n\nHe slaps Ren on th\u2019 shoulder, and hurries to round up another\nprospect.\n\n\u201cHa, ha!\u201d snorts Ren, \u201c---- of uh--I beg yore pardon, ma\u2019am. You see\nI didn\u2019t----\u201d\n\n\u201cHow quaint,\u201d sighs Matilda, like uh turtle-dove with uh full crop.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t it seem comfy to be mistaken fer married folks, Renley?\nIsn\u2019t th\u2019 moon lovely tonight. Let\u2019s take a little walk, Renley,\nit\u2019s too lovely to go inside.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat moon,\u201d says Ren, \u201cshore is lovely. It\u2019s full. I wish I--shore\nI\u2019d enjoy uh walk.\u201d\n\n               *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn hour later Ren climbed th\u2019 rickety stairs of Holt\u2019s hotel and\nbusted th\u2019 lock off their door gittin\u2019 in. Sig is lyin\u2019 on th\u2019 bed,\nwith his leg draped over th\u2019 foot and he\u2019s playin\u2019 \u201cGood Night,\nBeloved, Good Night,\u201d sort-a soft like on his mouth harp. He rolls\nhis eyes at Ren and lets th\u2019 organ slip out of his hands and slide\nunder th\u2019 bed. He turns over and points at his six-shooter hangin\u2019\non th\u2019 wall.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t, Ren!\u201d says he sort-a sad like, \u201cI\u2019m unarmed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYo\u2019re safe,\u201d groans Ren, sinkin\u2019 into uh chair. \u201cI ain\u2019t in no\nkillin\u2019 mood, Sig. I\u2019m borderin\u2019 on uh fit of despondency and I\nneeds sympathy and advice like uh calf needs milk. Honest, I feel\nlike uh Digger Injun would if somebody washed his neck and ears. My\nliver ain\u2019t noways fresh an\u2019 I feels that my lights is burnin\u2019 low.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I used to be uh lawless character,\u201d stated Sig, as he fumbled\nunder the bed for th\u2019 mouth harp, \u201c\u2018preachin\u2019 allus affected me\nthataway. Gospel truths seem to--don\u2019t strike me, Renley!\u201d\n\nRen slumped down in the chair and held his head in his hands.\n\n\u201cI knowed it, I knowed it! Dang it all, them last two drinks--\u201d\n\n\u201cDid she accept yuh?\u201d grinned Sig.\n\n\u201cAccept me!\u201d wailed Ren. \u201cDog-gone it, Sig, she didn\u2019t wait fer\nthat. She took me fer granted! She said--oh Lord! She said she\ndidn\u2019t care if I did used to act wild and shoot Chinamen and\nGreasers. Can yuh beat it, Sig? She gits me by th\u2019 arm and leads me\n\u2019way off down th\u2019 road--it was awful hot in that church and th\u2019\nhooch gits to bubblin\u2019, and I ain\u2019t noways to blame--leads me to\nthat old cottonwood tree, which th\u2019 lightnin\u2019 hit last summer, and\nsits me down on uh log. Cripes! Why can\u2019t lightnin\u2019 hit twice in th\u2019\nsame place? Then she--aw, I dunno--I do know that in th\u2019 argument I\ndidn\u2019t have no more chance than uh snowball in Yuma!\u201d\n\n\u201cGoin\u2019 to marry her, Ren?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot by a danged sight!\u201d wailed Ren. \u201cMebby she\u2019ll marry me though.\u201d\n\nSig took a deep breath and the strains uh \u201cMoonlight\u201d permeated the\nroom. Ren slipped his boot off sort-a unconcerned like and,\n\u201c_Bing!_\u201d Sig saw it comin\u2019 and ducked off the other side and the\nboot hit the other side and started the nails.\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d yelled the voice of the harness drummer who was in the next\nroom. \u201cCut out th\u2019 orchestra practise, you drunken sheep-herders!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d states Ren, \u201cmakes me forget personal animosities, Sig.\nHere\u2019s yore gun. Pull jist below that bunch uh cauliflower pitchers\non th\u2019 wall paper and it\u2019ll jist about rake his bunk. Ready?\u201d\n\nTh\u2019 door of th\u2019 opposite room closed quickly and th\u2019 drummer padded\noff down stairs and slept in uh chair.\n\n\u201cSig,\u201d says Ren, as he rolls into bed, \u201cI\u2019ll allus blame my downfall\non uh quirt.\u201d\n\n\u201cMisspelled,\u201d mumbled Sig. \u201cShould \u2019a\u2019 been \u2018quart.\u2019\u201d\n\n               *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next mornin\u2019 Sig saddled his horse and sat down in the stable\ndoor to roll a smoke.\n\n\u201cRen, yo\u2019re uh lucky devil,\u201d he stated.\n\nRen dropped his latigo strap and stared at Sig.\n\n\u201cWhat do yuh mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cHave another aig, Renley?\u201d mimicked Sig. \u201cThem cakes is all cold.\nLet me git yuh some hot ones, Renley. Take all th\u2019 cream yuh can\nuse, there\u2019s a-plenty. Have some more nice maple sirup, Renley.\u201d\n\n\u201cSig!\u201d Ren snapped his cinch hook and walked over to th\u2019 door.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to bowels of compassion, you don\u2019t show uh gut. If\nyou was uh real friend you\u2019d be figgerin\u2019 some way to save me,\ninstead of passin\u2019 out low comedy.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe ain\u2019t much to look at,\u201d agreed Sig, as he swung into th\u2019\nsaddle, \u201cbut many uh kind word is often hidden by sparse whiskers.\u201d\n\n\u201c----!\u201d snorts Ren. \u201cThere\u2019s Matilda, of th\u2019 angel face, wavin\u2019 at\nme to come back. I wonder what she wants?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe probably wants to know whether you prefers uh Methodist or uh\nBaptist preacher. Tell her yore folks raised yuh in th\u2019 Mormon\nfaith, Ren, and you can\u2019t consider no other. That\u2019ll delay\nproceedin\u2019s until she can send to Utah and----\u201d\n\nBut Ren was on his way out of town, and Sig followed suit.\n\nWell, they goes back to th\u2019 Seven A and goes to work again. Th\u2019\nboss, Old Man Padden, sends Sig with uh couple of other punchers to\nride th\u2019 breaks of th\u2019 Shell River after strays, and he keeps Ren at\nhome where there ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 to do but water some stock and go to\ntown after th\u2019 mail. Sig is away fer ten days, and when he returns\nhe\u2019s plumb lonesome fer company--Rosalind\u2019s especially.\n\nRen is sittin\u2019 on th\u2019 corral fence braidin\u2019 uh quirt when Sig rides\nin.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s Old Man Merton\u2019s boy Renley?\u201d greets Sig, yankin\u2019 his saddle\noff and hazin\u2019 his bronc into th\u2019 pasture. \u201cHow\u2019s everything?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d grins Ren. \u201cI seen her and Ricky Henderson ridin\u2019\nalong th\u2019 Dancin\u2019 Prairie trail twice this week, and I hears that\nshe\u2019s furnishin\u2019 Buck Masterson with uh clean napkin at each meal.\nBuck\u2019s uh changed man, Sigismund. He\u2019s usin\u2019 ba\u2019r ile on his boots\nand bay rum on his head.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat ol\u2019 pelican?\u201d yells Sig. \u201cIf that\u2019s all that\u2019s tryin\u2019 to beat\nmy time I\u2019m as good as married right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hates to tell yuh,\u201d states Ren sadly, \u201cbut them Piperock fellers,\ntakin\u2019 em as uh tribe, are shore beatin\u2019 yore time with Rosalind. I\nreckon you made uh hit th\u2019 first time she ever saw yuh, but she\u2019s\nheard too much agin\u2019 yuh since. I done talked with her and I finds\nout that she\u2019s partial to heroes. _Sabe?_ Nothin\u2019 but uh heero need\napply, and, Sig, there ain\u2019t no use you tryin\u2019 to be one uh them.\n\n\u201cAnyway, yuh can\u2019t see her before Monday. She went down to Curlew uh\nfew days ago, and said she would be back Monday afternoon on th\u2019\nstage.\u201d\n\n\u201cLikes heroes, eh?\u201d mused Sig. \u201cJist about what causes uh man to be\nuh hero?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh heero,\u201d states Ren, \u201cis uh feller who does jist what any one\nelse would have done in his place, but he beat \u2019em to it. _Sabe?_ He\nallus saves th\u2019 girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cSaves th\u2019 girl, eh?\u201d Sig runs his fingers down th\u2019 creases in his\nchaps and thinks deeply.\n\n\u201cRen, I got a idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cShoot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll save Rosalind.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh!\u201d Ren spat his cigaret out and stared at Sig. \u201cSave her from\nwhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d stated Sig, eagerlike.\n\n\u201cHaw! Haw! Haw! Save her from me! That\u2019s uh hy-iu idea, Ren. What am\nI supposed to be?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh desperado. Lissen. Art Miller carries money sometimes on th\u2019\nstage and almost every trip he has uh passenger or two what would\nassay six bits or uh dollar, and they\u2019re liable to be held up any\ntrip. Here\u2019s th\u2019 big idea:\n\n\u201cRemember them big rocks on this side of th\u2019 Hell Gate crossin\u2019?\nPeach of uh place fer uh holdup, Ren. Now, on Monday afternoon, you\nbe up in them rocks, with uh mask on, and when Art drives out of th\u2019\nford you throw down on him with yore rifle and yell, \u2018Hands up!\u2019\nMebby yuh better shoot once or twice so as to make th\u2019 play good.\nWe\u2019ll pull th\u2019 bullets out of some ca\u2019tridges so nobody won\u2019t git\nhurt. When you yells and shoots uh few times, here I comes across\nth\u2019 ford ridin\u2019 like th\u2019 devil and starts throwin\u2019 lead and you\nducks, sabe? I\u2019ll save th\u2019 stage from bein\u2019 held up and, bein\u2019 as\nRosalind is on th\u2019 stage, I\u2019ll be uh hero. Ren, are yuh game to help\nuh needin\u2019 friend?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd mebby go to Deer Lodge and wear uh number like uh box-car,\u201d\nobjected Ren sarcastically.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019ll know yuh,\u201d pleads Sig. \u201cDon\u2019t throw me down, Ren. How\nmany times you been to Piperock since I left?\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery day,\u201d grinned Ren.\n\n\u201cGosh! When is it comin\u2019 off?\u201d\n\nRen shook his head and looked thoughtful.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s th\u2019 cook yellin\u2019 \u2018supper\u2019 now. Let\u2019s eat.\u201d\n\nRen slid off the fence and looked at Sig.\n\n\u201cAre yuh goin\u2019 to help me out?\u201d he asked pleadingly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve decided to give it uh whirl,\u201d stated Ren. \u201cTo make th\u2019 play\ngood I\u2019ll go to Curlew on Sunday mornin\u2019 and circle th\u2019 stage from\nthere in the mornin\u2019, after givin\u2019 it out that I\u2019m on my way to\nMica. _Sabe_ th\u2019 play, Sig? I\u2019ll also hint that when I comes down\nth\u2019 trail I sees uh person who looks like Pete Melcher to me. Pete\nis holed up somewhere in th\u2019 west part of th\u2019 state, but he\u2019s liable\nto start operatin\u2019 over here any old time.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood stuff!\u201d yells Sig \u201cIt\u2019s shore white of you, Ren. Dog-gone,\nthere ain\u2019t no chance of uh slip-up and me, I\u2019ll be th\u2019 li\u2019l hero\nand save th\u2019 girl, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about th\u2019 slips in th\u2019 game,\u201d states Ren. \u201cIf Art\nMiller does rim me with his ol\u2019 riot gun, or if I gits uh free ride\nto Deer Lodge, I won\u2019t have to marry--huh! Every cloud has uh silver\nlinin\u2019, Sigismund Alexander.\u201d\n\n               *       *       *       *       *\n\nTh\u2019 next mornin\u2019, bein\u2019 Sunday, Ren throws his saddle on his brown\nmare and points off across th\u2019 hills towards Curlew, and on Monday\nmornin\u2019 Sig puts his ridin\u2019 gear on Old Man Padden\u2019s best lookin\u2019\nbronc, polishes up his boots and slips off across th\u2019 hills towards\nHell Gate Ca\u00f1on.\n\nSig breezes across th\u2019 hills with joy in his heart, so much joy that\nhe thumbs that bronc, with th\u2019 result that he almost gits set on\nfoot. He has time to burn, so he decides to go out of his way to say\n\u201chello\u201d to Pete Gonyer. Pete lives in uh li\u2019l cabin up in Roarin\u2019\nGulch, and Sig ain\u2019t been up that way fer some time. It will give\nhim an excuse fer bein\u2019 seen in th\u2019 Hell Gate hills.\n\nHe finds that Pete ain\u2019t home, so he ambles down th\u2019 gulch, ties up\nhis bronc and takes uh nap under uh bush. He sleeps about an hour\nand then moves on. He ain\u2019t got no watch, but th\u2019 sun looks about\none o\u2019clock, so he drops off th\u2019 hills to th\u2019 road and turns back\ntowards Piperock.\n\nHe jogs along slow \u2019till he gits to th\u2019 spring near th\u2019 Rock of\nAges, and he swings off to git uh drink. Right there he spies uh\nletter layin\u2019 near th\u2019 spring under uh bush, and nacherally he picks\nit up and looks it over.\n\n\u201cHuh!\u201d says he. \u201cAddressed to Jack Elberton, Helena. I reckon Art\nmust \u2019a\u2019 lost it goin\u2019 out.\u201d\n\nAnd then like anybody else would, he opens it to see who to send it\nback to. He reads it through twice, takes off his hat and reads it\nagain. It says:\n\n    In reply to your letter I can say that you\u2019ve got more\n    nerve than a mule. Just because I let you kiss me don\u2019t\n    prove conclusively that I love you. Also your statement\n    (or hint) that I\u2019ve got a perfectly good husband in the\n    land of the living doesn\u2019t feaze me either.\n\n    Your threat to come to Piperock to see me is amusing. I\u2019ve\n    made a hit with a big cowboy up here, who would take you\n    apart like a picture puzzle if I said the word. Take my\n    advice, Jackie and forget that you ever knew    Rosalind\n\nSig looks at th\u2019 letter for uh while and then stares at th\u2019 road. He\ngits up suddenly and looks at th\u2019 hoss tracks in the road and then\nhops for his bronc.\n\n\u201cGosh!\u201d says he. \u201cTh\u2019 stage is past!\u201d\n\nAnd he spurs up th\u2019 hill and throws th\u2019 quirt into that bronc and\nfogs th\u2019 hills. He\u2019s plumb miscalculated th\u2019 time, and by racin\u2019 fer\nthree miles across th\u2019 hills he\u2019s got uh chance to cut in ahead of\nth\u2019 stage.\n\n\u201cLord A\u2019mighty!\u201d he whoops, when he hits th\u2019 road agin and sees uh\ncloud uh dust still hangin\u2019 around th\u2019 first turn of th\u2019 road.\n\u201cMebby I\u2019ll catch \u2019em yet. I shore got to do somethin\u2019 to crab this\nhold-up play! I can\u2019t let Ren take uh chance like this now. Cripes!\nMebby Art is lookin\u2019 fer uh play of this kind and he\u2019ll fill Ren\nfull uh buck-shot. Git a-goin\u2019 yuh buzzard-headed, bunch uh coyote\nbait! If I can git close enough to attract Art\u2019s attention before he\ndrives out of th\u2019 ford, Ren will sabe that somethin\u2019 has gone wrong\nand keep out-a sight.\u201d\n\nThe four hosses of th\u2019 stage had jist finished drinkin\u2019 as Sig races\nin sight, and as they starts out th\u2019 other side Sig waves his rifle\nand starts shootin\u2019.\n\nThat bronc wasn\u2019t noways gun broke, so it starts sun-fishin\u2019 at th\u2019\nfirst shot and bores straight fer th\u2019 stage. Sig sees Art Miller\nstand up in his seat and throw th\u2019 whip to his leaders with one hand\nand fire both barrels of his riot gun with th\u2019 other.\n\nSig ducks jist in time to save his life. Art shoots uh li\u2019l high and\nwhen Sig ducks all he gits is th\u2019 rakins of about six shot across\nhis shoulder. One shot punctures th\u2019 brone\u2019s ear and it shore moves\nup and down a-plenty.\n\nTh\u2019 stage is rockin\u2019 and swayin\u2019 up th\u2019 road as fast as four scared\nand whipped cayuses can yank it and Art Miller is bracin\u2019 hisself\nand throwin\u2019 leather promiscuous. Sig lost his rifle and is now\nridin\u2019 with both hands.\n\nArt drops his whip, wraps his lines around his arm and, in tryin\u2019 to\nput more shells in his gun, swings his team off th\u2019 road. They go\ngood for about ten jumps and then they\u2019re into th\u2019 timber.\n\nNatcherally th\u2019 leaders goes on opposite sides of uh tree, with th\u2019\nresult that th\u2019 wheelers skid to one side and th\u2019 stage turns uh\nhandspring. I reckon that Sig\u2019s bronc thinks it\u2019s uh real party fer\nits benefit, \u2019cause it pitches right into th\u2019 tangle and Sig lights\nsittin\u2019 down through th\u2019 glass door of th\u2019 stage, which is reposin\u2019\nserenely on its side when he arrives.\n\nSig sits there fer uh few minutes collectin\u2019 his thoughts, when he\ndiscovers that he\u2019s sittin\u2019 on somebody\u2019s head.\n\n\u201cRosalind!\u201d is th\u2019 first thought that comes into his head, so he\nslides part way out and takes said head between his hands.\n\n\u201cRosalind!\u201d he wails. \u201cMy Gawd!\u201d\n\nHe can\u2019t see very plain until he climbs out and leans over th\u2019\ncasing. \u201cSpeak to me, Rosalind!\u201d he sobs. \u201cHu-honey, I wants yuh\nto--the devil!\u201d\n\nA figger rises up from th\u2019 coach, looks him in th\u2019 eye and spits out\nthree perfectly good teeth.\n\n\u201cI begs yore pardon,\u201d says Sig, in a dazed sort of uh way.\n\n\u201cYo\u2019re welcome,\u201d says th\u2019 other party, puttin\u2019 his finger into th\u2019\nplace where his teeth used to be, and lookin\u2019 foolish.\n\n\u201cUh--hu--huh!\u201d says a voice behind them, and there stands Art\nMiller.\n\nMost of his clothes are missin\u2019 and he\u2019s nursin\u2019 uh skinned elbow\nand leanin\u2019 agin\u2019 uh wheel fer support.\n\n\u201cWhat happened, driver?\u201d asks th\u2019 party of th\u2019 missin\u2019 teeth.\n\nArt looks over th\u2019 wreck and then back at th\u2019 bald head stickin\u2019 out\nof th\u2019 stage.\n\n\u201cIf it was yore eyes instead of yore teeth I might take th\u2019 trouble\nto explain,\u201d he snaps. \u201cTake uh look and form yore own conclusions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe--huh--seem to have wrecked.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe--huh--have!\u201d snapped Art, and then to Sig: \u201cWhat do yuh mean by\nstampedin\u2019 my outfit thataway, eh? Comin\u2019 along a-shootin\u2019 like uh\ncrazy half-breed!\u201d\n\n\u201cArt,\u201d says Sig, \u201cI shore begs yore pardon if I done wrong, but I\u2019d\nalmost swear that I hears somebody yell \u2018Hands up!\u2019 at you, when you\npulls out of th\u2019 ford, and I comes to yore rescue. Dog-gone it all,\nthat\u2019s allus th\u2019 way. When yuh tries to do uh feller uh favor he\ndon\u2019t appreciate it.\u201d\n\nSig looks sorry fer himself and rolls uh smoke.\n\n\u201cYore hearin\u2019 is fine,\u201d states Art, after thinkin\u2019 fer uh minute.\n\u201cJist as we pulls out of th\u2019 ford, that rattle-headed, Roman-nosed,\noff leader uh mine leans back and lets th\u2019 pinto wheeler into th\u2019\nstretchers. What I yells was--I begs yore pardon, preacher, did you\nspeak?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d mumbles th\u2019 party of th\u2019 missin\u2019 teeth. \u201cThings are bad\nenough without repeatin\u2019 your former exclamations.\u201d\n\n\u201cPreacher,\u201d wonders Sig out loud. \u201cAnother preacher in th\u2019 country?\nWe done got one in Piperock now, Art. One with all his teeth, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d agreed Art. \u201cBut he\u2019s uh Baptist. This\u2019n is uh\nPresbyterian. Miss Beebee\u2019s uh Presbyterian, and she insists on her\nown tribe fer th\u2019 marriage _wau-wau_. _Sabe?_\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen is this event due to happen?\u201d grins Sig.\n\n\u201cTonight,\u201d states Art. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll bet Buck Masterson is runnin\u2019 rings\naround himself right now. We\u2019re due.\u201d\n\n\u201cBuck Masterson?\u201d mumbles Sig. \u201cI don\u2019t see----\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody does either,\u201d chuckles Art. \u201cAin\u2019t he gittin\u2019 uh prize\npackage?\u201d\n\nSig grunts and wonders if some of th\u2019 buck-shot didn\u2019t go deeper\nthan just through th\u2019 skin. He feels dazed like. Art Miller is\nfumblin\u2019 inside his shirt and finally produces a wrinkled envelope.\n\n\u201cI jist happened to remember it, Sig. I sees Ren Merton yesterday in\nCurlew and he sends you this. Wrote it too late to mail. Li\u2019l\nsurprise.\u201d\n\nHe finished with a wink at th\u2019 preacher person, who is huntin\u2019\naround inside th\u2019 wrecked stage fer his teeth.\n\nSig opened th\u2019 envelope and read th\u2019 followin\u2019 aloud:\n\n    \u201cDeer Sigismund:\n\n    Me and Rosalind were married here today and send you our\n    best wishes. I hated to double-cross you but I told her\n    about our plans and she said that heroes were born and\n    not made and that I\u2019d be one if I saved her from a\n    certain bow-legged person we both know. I asks your\n    pardon and wishes to state that I wouldn\u2019t have done it\n    if I had of been sober. You can have that new quirt\n    which is hangin\u2019 over my bunk. You know how a feller\n    loses his head when he\u2019s spifflikated.\n\n                        Yours respy\n                          Renley St. Clair Merton & wife.\n\n    P.S. The preacher what tied the not is in the stage and\n    can tell you all about it. I hope you don\u2019t kill him\n    during the rescue \u2019cause he never asked fer a cent.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou--you performed a marriage in Curlew last night?\u201d asked Sig, and\nth\u2019 preacher nods.\n\n\u201cYeth thir,\u201d he states, with his tongue explorin\u2019 where his teeth\nused to bed down. \u201cBut I never wath paid a thent.\u201d\n\nSig fumbled around in his pocket for a moment and then hauled out a\nsmall roll of bills.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s uh ten spot with my compliments, old-timer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWath he a friend of yours?\u201d asks th\u2019 preacher.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says Sig, feelin\u2019 of th\u2019 two envelopes in his chaps pocket,\n\u201che don\u2019t think so, but he don\u2019t know it all. If uh man would ask me\nI\u2019d say, yes.\u201d\n\nSig recovers his horse and pulls out fer Piperock, after promisin\u2019\nArt that he\u2019ll send help out to them. Buck is standin\u2019 in front of\nth\u2019 saloon and as Sig rides up he yells--\n\n\u201cSeen anythin\u2019 of th\u2019 stage, Sig?\u201d\n\nSig tells him about th\u2019 smash-up and then goes in and drapes himself\nover th\u2019 bar. Ricky Henderson is there and they crooks elbows\nnumerous.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Ren?\u201d asks Ricky. \u201cI ain\u2019t seen him since Saturday. Him and\nthat Rosalind person is thicker than axle grease in January. Been\nout ridin\u2019 every day last week. I thought you had aspirations\nthataway, Sig.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cNot me, Ricky. Yore uncle Siggie knows when he\u2019s safe. I\u2019m goin\u2019\nover to congratulate th\u2019 bride, and then I\u2019m goin\u2019 to come back and\nfill my hide with some more absent-minded juice. So long.\u201d\n\nHe ambles across th\u2019 street to th\u2019 restaurant and finds Miss Matilda\ntellin\u2019 th\u2019 Chink what to have fer supper.\n\n\u201cHowdy,\u201d says Sig. \u201cI reckon I can congratulate you on yore marriage\nto Buck.\u201d\n\nMatilda blushes through her whiskers and smooths her skirt.\n\n\u201cThanks, Sigismund. I had hopes that you and Rosalind could stand up\nwith us, but she\u2019s in Curlew and won\u2019t be back. I\u2019ll have to git\nMiss Harris. Would you like to stand up with her?\u201d\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d says Sig, \u201cwhile I admires such functions uh heap, I\u2019d uh\nlot rather jist sit on th\u2019 bench and watch \u2019em. Rosalind is uh real\nnice girl, I reckon, but her and me ain\u2019t----\u201d\n\nMiss Beebee pats Sig on th\u2019 shoulder in uh motherly way.\n\n\u201cRosalind is uh nice girl but she\u2019s got uh temper that would, when\nit busts, make uh stick of dynamite sound like th\u2019 scratchin\u2019 of uh\nsulfur match. She told me that she liked yore looks th\u2019 first time\nshe ever seen yuh, Sigismund, but it\u2019s money she wants--not love.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s done married Ren,\u201d states Sig sarcastically.\n\n\u201cAlready? My, my, she shore didn\u2019t take any chances. I\u2019ll tell you\nuh secret Ricky Henderson told.\u201d\n\nSig looked foolishly at her and scratched his head.\n\n\u201cRicky did, eh? Jist about how much did that _hombre_ e-lucidate?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe came in here the other day after Renley had gone, and he told us\nall about Renley being the real owner of the Triangle cattle and\nalso havin\u2019 uh big interest in th\u2019 Seven A. Oh, he told us all about\nRenley. Ricky had been drinkin\u2019, I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo Rosalind----\u201d\n\n\u201cJist a moment, Sigismund. I want to make a little confession. Her\nname is not Rosalind, but Matilda. We traded names when we came up\nhere because mine fits her better than her own. Of course all our\nfriends outside of Piperock know that my name is Rosalind. Of course\nwhen she found out all about Renley----\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2019m,\u201d agreed Sig. \u201cShe marries him fer his money. Honest, ma\u2019am,\nI feels fer both of them.\u201d\n\nSig walks back across th\u2019 street in uh dazed sort-a way and leans\nagainst th\u2019 bar.\n\n\u201cRosalind, eh?\u201d he snorts to himself. \u201cWell, don\u2019t that beat four of\nuh kind. Renley is th\u2019 owner of th\u2019-- Gosh! There\u2019s goin\u2019 to be uh\nnoise like uh ton of dynamite in that li\u2019l ol\u2019 honeymoon. Huh! That\nElberton person must shore be uh collector uh knick-knacks and--I\nwonder if he was drunk, too?\u201d\n\nBuck Masterson walks in from th\u2019 front and ranges alongside of Sig.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve sent fer th\u2019 preacher,\u201d he states.\n\nBut Sig jist grunts. He\u2019s tryin\u2019 to visualize th\u2019 face on Jack\nElberton, which would want to come clear to Piperock to kiss Miss\nBeebee.\n\n\u201cDid you know her name was Rosalind?\u201d asks Sig.\n\n\u201cShee,\u201d says Buck, and then he gits confidential and talks in uh low\ntone. \u201cDog-gone th\u2019 luck, Sig, I shore wish it was all over. It\u2019s\ngot me so danged jumpy that I flinches at everything. I wish--huh--I\nwish--say, Sig, uh feller hadn\u2019t ought to drink whisky a-tall. He\nhadn\u2019t ought to take even one li\u2019l friendly drink. I\u2019ll----\u201d\n\n\u201cSay,\u201d snorts Sig, \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to tell me that you was full when\nyou----\u201d\n\n\u201cFuller\u2019n uh shepherd,\u201d states Buck solemnly. \u201cBy cripes, I was so\nfull that I\u2019d have proposed to uh--say, where yuh goin\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cMe?\u201d asks Sig, turnin\u2019 around in th\u2019 doorway, and holdin\u2019 up his\nright hand. \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 out to meet that preacher person and\nI\u2019m--goin\u2019--to--sign--th\u2019 pledge! _Sabe?_ Self-preservation is th\u2019\nfirst law of nature, and I\u2019d rather be preserved than pickled. It\u2019s\nsafer.\u201d\n\n\n                               The End",
