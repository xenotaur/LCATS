    "body": "He should have known better. He admitted that, now. Listening to the\nspacemen in Trixon and Cleg would have saved his skin. They told him\nthat Flormaseron was a hellhole where Creation had run mad. The only\nthing was, even they hadn't known how bad it was. Clark Travis worked\nthe walnut stud of his _stil_ disintegrator hopefully, but when it\nsputtered he gave it up.\n\nThe arklings were coming for him. Through the opening in the stone\ntraceries of the ancient doorway, he saw the red aura that floated\nover them as they came up the stone ramp. Clark turned and ran along\nthe sloping floor, down into the black, labyrinthine windings of the\nancient city. His spacebooted feet made soft, slapping sounds. His\nbeamlight cast a white brilliant glow ahead of him. He ran past several\nintersecting corridors before he skidded around a corner into one.\n\nClark Travis lost himself in the ruins. He went down into the bowels of\nthis city that was in its glory before the Earth had been more than a\nspinning ball of fire in space. He saw odd animals carved in the walls,\nqueerly human things at work on ships and weapons, tall men and lovely\nwomen etched in bas-relief in the marble.\n\nThe deeper down he went, the more he was putting himself in the\narklings' power. They were familiar with this rotting pile of masonry,\nwhere the tunnels were dark strips out of Hades. Their red aura lighted\nthe winding passageways. Clark only had his beamlight for the blackness.\n\nHe snapped off the power, stood waiting. His breath came softly. The\ntunnels were black, as black as space itself; as black as Martin\nKent's eyes had been when he first told him about Flormaseron and the\nsleeping goddess of the crystal crypt.\n\n\"She isn't a goddess, of course,\" Kent had said, seriously. \"She's\nthe last remnant of the first race that ever came into existence. The\nproduct of a million generations of culture and scientific knowledge.\nWhen the disaster struck at her people, the chief scientists encased\nher in a block of crystal and hid her somewhere on Flormaseron. She's\nstill there--and still alive.\n\n\"Think of it, Clark! A woman with the knowledge of such a race. Before\nthey enclosed her, they thought-fed her brain with knowledge, and so\narranged the crystal that during all the years of her interment, she\nwould learn! A brain like that--why it would revolutionize our own\nculture. The Earth'd go millions of years ahead in science, if we could\nonly find her--and bring her back to life!\"\n\nTravis had said, \"If she's entombed on a hellhole like Flormaseron,\nhow'd you ever hear of her?\"\n\nMartin Kent took Travis by the arm, led him out the door of his office\nand into the museum corridor. Here in Solar Museum, Mars Division, Kent\nwas absolute ruler. Behind him he had the billions of credits that\nEarth and Mars and Venus poured into their cultural endeavors. From\nall over the solar system Solar brought stuffed animals, crumbling\nbricks from ancient cities, rusted weapons that experts studied and\nreconstructed in glittering _stil_.\n\nThey walked past a panoramic window of a Venusian sea-bottom and into a\nnarrow room that held a safe inset in its east wall. Kent put the flat\nof his hand on the lock, and waited. A deep humming throbbed from\nbehind the glistening metal wall. The huge door swung open.\n\nKent reached in and brought out a tiny vial of green metal. He\nunscrewed the lid, withdrew a folded scroll. \"It's all here, Clark.\nStylogrammed on flexible metal. It's ages old. One of our field parties\ncame across it in a dried sea-bed on Clex. It puzzled us a long time,\nuntil Fielding came across a key to the writing, and translated it.\"\n\nTravis turned the metallic paper over, looked at the queerly graceful\nwriting. He looked at Kent inquiringly.\n\nKent smiled, \"Well, what do you say? I'd go myself if I were younger.\nAnd, if it didn't cost so much, I'd send a field party. But it's a\ngamble, and the Board probably wouldn't agree to spending credits on\nit. But one man could go. One man--like you.\"\n\nTravis grinned. He was tall and saturnine, brown with the heat of many\nsuns. His body had been hardened on the deserts of Proxima Centauri,\nand under the seas of Venus.\n\nKent went on, \"You're the best archaeologist I know. You've been in\ntight spots before. You can fight, if you have to. A thing like trouble\nis an old friend to you.\"\n\nTravis remembered the polyps in the Venusian water-caves where he'd\nalmost lost an arm before he got past them to bring the museum the\nonly specimen of the primal undine race of Venus ever seen above the\nsea-mists. He had found a petrified boat on Sirius' third planet, to\nprove that at one time there had been seas on that baked potato of a\nplanet. But for the last six months he had moped around Mars Port,\nstudying alluvial deposits, wishing for something to take him and his\nequipment out into the star-paths again.\n\n\"I'll go, Mart. And if you'd only shaved this morning I might kiss you\nfor the chance!\"\n\nKent laughed and waved a hand. \"Order what you need. I guess the museum\ncan afford a few thousand credits, considering your record--even on\nsuch a gamble.\"\n\n\n\nTravis took his spaceboat out from Mars to Titan, and then on to\nProxima Centauri. He asked questions in taverns and study halls. He\nheard of the _arklings_, of the ruined cities and temples. He heard\nof the _arklings'_ hate for strangers. But Travis didn't scare easily.\nHe checked his weapons and equipment, tossed in an extra case of\n_safusas_-wine and waved a farewell.\n\nIn the darkness he tried to grin and failed. He could hear them coming,\nat a distance. Their queer _slip-pat_ footsounds carried a long way. He\ncouldn't tell just how far away they were.\n\nTravis went on, into the darkness.\n\nThe light came suddenly, as he rounded a bend in the tunnel. It was\nmilky-red, like the ancient ko-yao porcelains, delicately flushed and\ntinted. It shook as a veil might in a breeze. It bellied and leaped. It\nsent its streamers into the blackness and lighted up the tunnel.\n\nThere was a queer menace about the light, a beating like the breath of\nan angry Sindri, Venus-god of fire. It came in little pinkish puffs.\nThere was no heat, only that overbearing menace. Through the pink\nlight, Travis thought he saw queerly shaped forms standing still and\nbrooding. There was a series of cones, and huge globes that seemed to\nfloat in an orbit--\n\nHe did not hear the _slip-pat_ until too late. A hairy body landed on\nhis shoulders and he pitched to his knees on the eon-old stone floor.\nAs he fell he whirled and brought his _stil_-gun up. It was empty, but\nthe long, ringed barrel sideswiped the _arkling's_ face and knocked him\naway.\n\nTravis got to his feet as the others hurtled at him. Giant hands that\nwere smooth-palmed and hairy-backed hasked at his arms and leather\nspace-harness. He slammed fists at the faces revealed by the floating\nred aura over them. He tried to use footwork, but the space was too\nnarrow. It was kill or be killed, and he just didn't have the strength\nto stop them.\n\nA palm caught him on the ear and sent his head ringing like a carrillon\ntower. A fanged mouth fastened on his thigh, biting deep. Another hand\nraked at his naked arm and gouged out flesh.\n\nTravis leaped for them, hoping to run over their bodies and go back up\nthe tunnel faster than they could follow. But a big _arkling_ rose up\nfrom the pack and swung a flat hand. The blow caught him on his chest,\nsent him reeling and sickened, back and back--\n\nThe _arklings_ cried out just as the pink light swept up all around\nTravis. The menace was unbearable as he fell back and into the pale\nbarrier. It bathed him and whispered to him and threatened him with\nqueer and maddening ways to die. It caught him in its tenuous folds and\nheld him there, cradled, as the voices told him of a water-death that\ntook eleven years, each year more painful than the last; they gloated\nover a spit and a fire of red coals that cooked a man over a space of\nmonths; they whimpered, themselves scarcely daring to think of the\nbarbaric tortures of Rudra the eternal....\n\nA cool something touched his forehead. Travis tried to focus his eyes\nthrough the subtle distortions of the pink mists. He saw the twin blue\npools at first, and then the yellow shower of hair graced with the\ntriangular headgear blazing with jewels. The blue pool were her eyes,\nand they were wide and open, and filled with a wisdom that made Travis\nshudder deep in his guts.\n\nAnd yet, there was a _fear_ in those blue eyes, too.\n\nShe wore a transparent film with a slender golden thong looped at her\nmiddle. She murmured, \"You are Clark Travis, an Earth-thing. You came\nto kidnap me. Yes. And the _arklings_ have harmed you.\"\n\nThe woman turned and stared toward the tunnel. A white hand fumbled at\nher girdle, drew out a pencil-thin rod of metal. She went away from\nTravis and stepped into the tunnel. Travis tried to watch her, but the\npain of his wounds, and the ringing in his temples bothered his eyes.\nThere was a terrific green flare that tinted the pale pink light--\n\nAnd silence.\n\nTravis knew the _arklings_ were just so much powder drifting from\ntunnel ceiling and wall.\n\nThe woman came back, seeming to float through the light. She brooded\nat him with her wise eyes. Travis could read the fear in them more\ndistinctly, now.\n\n\n\nShe put out a hand and closed her warm fingers on his. She led him\nthrough the beams of pink light and into white brilliance, into a room\nthat he had beheld briefly through the pink mists from the tunnel. The\ncone-towers were there, grouped by threes around the room. And the\nglobes that rotated lazily overhead in orbits were fiery with golden\nluminescence. They warmed Travis as they floated.\n\nIn the middle of the room lay a huge crystal, scooped hollow by some\nlong-dead artisan. It had indentations and mounds in it. Travis\nrealized it was carved with exact care to fit a reclining body. From\nthe walls of the crystal calyx stemmed thin golden wires, reaching\nacross to the cones. And against the wall, humming and throbbing, were\nthe dynamos and engines that fed the cones.\n\n\"I am Nuala,\" the girl said in her silvery voice. \"I am of the\nNekkalad, the first humanoid race in our universe. I have been encased\nin the calyx for eons. Unrememberable eons. I have seen the rise and\nfall of your planet, and the fall of others. I have seen--\"\n\nShe broke off, shuddering.\n\nTravis said wonderingly, \"You look so young. If it weren't that Martin\nKent told me about you, I'd--\"\n\nShe let him look at her, standing with her eyes lowered. Travis had\nseen the _landuli_, the dancing girls raised by the princes of Orion-3;\nhad seen the white-tressed houris of Venus; had seen the golden women\nbred for men's pleasure by the Kafars of Proxima Centauri. He had\nnever seen anyone as lovely as this first woman. Her legs were long\nand white, her hips gently rounded. The high arch of her breasts were\npoetry.\n\nAnd then she raised her lashes.\n\nHer blue eyes were ancient as space itself, as filled with nameless\nknowledge, with wisdom beyond Travis's understanding. They had beheld\nall things, from the slug that came out of a borning world's ocean\nbottom to the scribblings of the universe's mightiest scientist. Her\nears had heard the songs of Sull and the symphonies of Bach and Lyrn.\n\nTravis was aware of all that staring into her eyes. He whispered,\n\"But--how?\"\n\nShe gestured at the calyx and the wires. \"Those machines feed me\nenergy that I need to stay alive. They also feed me the intellectual\nstimulation I need to stay sane.\n\n\"Man's thoughts can be recorded. You know that. Therefore they give off\nsome electrical flow. I will not go into the whys of it. You would not\nunderstand. But those electrical flows never die. They fade and fade,\nalmost to nothingness--but not quite. The dynamos here pick them up,\namplify them.\n\n\"Here in the crystal calyx I have been fed all thought since the\nWerwile smashed Flormaseron. I spent years with a being called the\nDiscoverer--before he disappeared into some strange twisting of the\nspace-time continuum. It was he who warned me of Rudra, the Werwile. He\nsaid he was stirring--about to come again.\"\n\nTravis muttered, \"The Werwile?\"\n\nThe girl laughed softly at his puzzled face. \"The Werwile, yes. The\neternal one. He who never sleeps. He who knows all things. Your race\ncalls him Devil ... a race-memory of the first beginnings of the\nhumanoid cell, of the one who smashed the first race just when it was\nrising to its glory. All your legends, all the legends of all men\ncontain mention of him. The Rebel. Loki. Venus's Badal. Cygni's Daldal.\"\n\n\"You mean, there is someone like that? An actual person?\"\n\n\"Why not? Your race has dreamed of immortality. So has every race. The\nWerwile found it.\"\n\nTravis hooked his thumbs in the metal loops of his space-harness and\nwaited. Nuala walked about the big chamber, touching a glittering cone,\nstaring up at a whirling golden globe.\n\nShe went on, \"He found it, smashed his own people in a holocaust of\ndestruction, and went into another cosmos. Now he is coming back. The\nirony of it is that he hollowed out this crystal crypt himself--and\nit was here he built his own evil knowledge. My people put me here,\nthinking he would never return....\"\n\nTravis chuckled, \"What can one man do to worry you?\"\n\nShe looked at him, and her contempt was as tangible as a slap across\nthe face. \"You are a child. Just a baby. You don't dream of the\nsciences that Rudra will employ. He can sweep your Earth-empire ahead\nof him as a breeze takes a dry leaf. Look about you. See the cones, the\nglobes, and ask yourself--can your science duplicate them? And then\nask, if Rudra, the Werwile, smashed a civilization that could produce\nall this, what will he do against Earth?\"\n\nThe fear in the blue eyes touched Travis then, under the leather of his\nbelt. His stomach tightened. Nervously, he licked at his dry lips. He\nthought of Mars Port, of New York Terminal, of the giant spacers that\nplied the starways throughout the System, of the jewels and food and\nriches they carried in their holds. He thought of his Iowa home, of his\nparents. He visualized that culture, those people, all smashed.\n\nHe whispered, \"What can we do?\"\n\nNuala shrugged white shoulders. \"Nothing. If Rudra smashed the\nNekkalad, what can your Earth-people do?\"\n\n\"We can fight!\" Travis grated.\n\nShe was amused. \"How?\"\n\n\"We could attack him, before he suspects. He does not know that we\nknow. A little surprise might turn the trick.\"\n\nThe pain of his wounds made him dizzy, but it seemed to Travis that\nNuala opened her eyes in surprise. She gloomed at him long moments,\na white-fingered hand toying with the golden hemp of her girdle. She\nmurmured softly, \"Surprise? Yes, a sudden attack might work. If we\ncould get past the barbarians who guard him, there is something we\nmight do.\"\n\nHer face grew blurred in his eyes. He saw her as through a mist. He was\nfalling away from her, dropping. She cried out in alarm, ran toward\nhim. Her soft hands caught him, but could not hold his big body. He hit\nthe floor and lay still.\n\n\n\nThere was perfume in his nostrils, and a faint murmur of sound. Travis\nopened his eyes, lay staring up at the white ceiling of the crystal\ncrypt. He turned his neck, saw Nuala with oddly-shaped jars set before\nher on a long, flat tabletop.\n\nShe was murmuring, \"If only I were sure of the cell formation, it would\nbe easy. Not like ours, yet different from that of the _arklings_.\nThis ... yes, this might be the right one.\"\n\nShe came toward him a blue jar grooved and opaque in her hand. Smiling\nat him, she unscrewed the top and dipped her fingers inside. She\nbrought out a reddish jelly that she smoothed gently into the bite in\nhis thigh, then into the torn flesh of his arm. There was faint pain, a\ntingle of nausea.\n\n\"It will pass,\" said Nuala. \"The red jelly is _celluvalin_. It is--you\nmight call it plastic flesh. It has the cell formation of blood and\nsinew, and will knit and unite with the torn sections of your body.\"\n\nTravis lay still. The pain was going swiftly. Tentatively he flexed his\nleg. It moved easily. He grinned, \"You could make a fortune with that\non Earth or Mars. What the Fleet wouldn't give for plastic flesh. Whew!\"\n\nNuala sighed and replaced the jars. \"If we defeat Rudra, I will return\nto the calyx. There is no place in the world for me.\"\n\nTravis saw the blue eyes and the tiredness, the wisdom and knowledge\nbehind them, and bit at his lip. She was right. Earth and Mars,\neven Cyngi and Lalande-80 would be boring to her. She knew too much\nto be happy with anyone less intelligent than she. And that meant\neveryone--except the Werwile.\n\nTravis swung his long legs in their torn spaceslacks off the table. He\nran his hands over the broad leathern belt that held his _stil_-gun and\nholster, over the leather-and-cloth jerkin with the ripped sleeves.\n\n\"Guess I'm ready to go. I feel good again. But I'd like to stay that\nway. Do you have another of those pencil-things?\"\n\nHe pointed at her girdle. She drew out the weapon and smiled, \"You mean\nthe displacer. It forces the electrons of an object out of their orbit.\nTurns them into other orbits, and makes them dust.\"\n\nShe went to a drawer, drew out three of the pencil-guns, and handed\nthem to him. \"You will be safe with these.\"\n\nNuala went to the pink barrier and beckoned to him. \"Hurry. The sooner\nwe surprise Rudra, the better.\"\n\nThe _arklings_ left them strictly alone. They went up through the\ntunnels, past the carven walls to the ruins of the Nekkalad temples.\nSprawled across acres of the barren, pitted surface of the planet, the\nwhite towers and jagged walls of the once-massive buildings were like\nhuge play-things scattered by a child-giant in petulant anger.\n\nNuala breathed, \"Before Rudra came and smashed them, they were the\nloveliest things in all the universe.\"\n\nThe silvered hull of Travis's spacer lay a hundred yards from the\ncrumbled wall, on a bed of powdered black rock. Nuala walked around\nit, frowning. She shook her head, her long yellow hair fluttering about\nher shoulders.\n\n\"It will never make the trip. There are things to be done to it.\"\n\nShe looked at him, troubled. She asked, \"Do you know what a Calakin\ncurvature-annihilator is? Or a Wilwal warping-beam?\"\n\nTravis shook his head.\n\nNuala said, \"I will have to make them, then. You do have a workshop,\nI know. I read your thoughts as you came toward Nekkalad. Even before\nthat, in Mars Port with Martin Kent.\"\n\nShe went up the metal ladder into the ship. She walked with calm\nassurance toward the repair room. Travis came after her, wondering, a\nlittle rattled. It was odd to see a woman so familiar with his life,\nwith his own inner thoughts. He thought of Jonquilon, the red-headed\ndancer at Mars Port. Cheeks red, he settled himself on a bench, and\nwatched her.\n\n\n\nNuala was murmuring, \"We'll need a speed-up job on your rockets to\nget them through the Break. And a super-blaster to add to your own\nspace-warper. Hmm ... wires all right. Sheet metal not too strong, but\nit'll do....\"\n\nHer voice droned on. Travis found himself lost in contemplation of her.\nShe looked like any girl you might see in the Chez Saturn or Planetary\nPark. She might be fussing over a jalanadon steak instead of a\nspace-warper. If it weren't for her eyes ... so blue ... but so filled\nwith that frightening knowledge, with wisdom, she'd make a guy a swell\nwife. He wondered how she kissed.\n\n\"Now you must help me,\" she said, turning to him. She saw his abrupt\nchange of expression and brooded at him. She shook her head suddenly\nand held out a small engine rigged with wheels and wires, with\narmatures and generator. \"Attach it to the drive shaft, ahead of the\ncombustion chambers.\"\n\nShe showed him how, and explained its working. Travis didn't get the\nwhole thing, but he understood enough to know that even the Chalmers\nrockets would be improved with this contraption. It smoothed the\nblastings of the jets, built them up on their own power. The ship\nwould be like a bullet that, once shot from the gun, would receive\nanother firing every ten feet. It was speed added to speed.\n\nNuala smiled at his blank look, \"Don't bother about whys and wherefors.\nJust let me handle things.\"\n\n\n\nTravis grumbled under his breath, cramped under the jets and installing\nthe super-blaster. It fretted his male pride to feel that a woman--even\nsuch a woman as Nuala--knew more about the workings of his own\nspace-ship than he knew himself.\n\nHe hit a Litson wrench against a fitting in anger. \"All this talk of\nRudra. The eternal werwile! Blah! How do I know there _is_ any such\nperson?\"\n\nThe thought stopped him. He lay there in the cramped space between\njet-sheathing and baffles and grinned at his own stupidity. \"How do I\nknow she's the one I came out here to find, even? I never saw her in\nthe calyx!\" Deep in the heart of him, he knew that Nuala was--Nuala.\nHer eyes told him that. He muttered, \"Just the same, I don't have any\nproof about this werwile!\"\n\nHe crawled out of the rocket-room and stood up in the narrow corridor,\nwiping sweat from his eyes. Under his feet the floor quivered as\nthe rockets thundered into life. Travis put a calloused hand on a\nwall-rail. The rockets blasted faster, turning the corridor into a\nmaelstrom of sound.\n\nThe ship was lifting, leaving the blackened planet and the ruined\ntemples far below it. There was a sudden weightlessness to his body\nthat told him they were out in space, now, slipping along with\nvertiginous speed.\n\nHe clanked the lock on the rocket-chamber door and went to find Nuala.\n\nShe was bent over the control panel, moving her white fingers across\nthe dials. She did not look up when he came to a stop beside her. She\nmerely said, \"I'll have to take this all apart. Your wiring system is\nonly 87 per cent efficient.\"\n\n\"That's pretty good,\" Travis rasped, \"On the first trampers that went\nto the moon, 35 per cent was hot stuff.\"\n\nNuala sniffed and reached for a kit of tools. Travis put out a hand and\nclosed it on her wrist. She looked up at him from under long yellow\neyelashes.\n\n\"How do I know there _is_ a Rudra?\" he said harshly. \"How do I know you\naren't just using me for ... for....\"\n\n\"For what?\" she asked serenely, not moving to draw her wrist away.\n\"Where in all your worlds would I want to go? I know everything there\nis to know about them--and you.\"\n\n\"Even--Jonquilon?\"\n\nShe let amusement reach up through the blue of her eyes. She mocked him\ngravely, \"I know about that weekend you spent with her, when you let\nthe museum get scooped on the canal-men bones on Mars.\"\n\nTravis let her hand go. He grumbled, \"It was worth it.\"\n\nHer laughter was like silver droplets. She mocked, \"What do you know\nabout women? Have you ever seen the water-girls on Tasselas, or the\nbubble-women that float in the Magellanic cluster? I could show you\nways of--\"\n\nShe broke off and shook herself. She said dryly, \"I'm letting my\nemotions run away with me. I can't do that with the werwile. And,\nspeaking of him--you ask proof, do you?\"\n\nNuala shrugged. \"I really can't prove him to you except by showing him.\nTrust me for three--four days. Then you will have your proof.\" The\nfear was back in her eyes as she whispered, \"You will have it then. By\nGrock, you will have it!\"\n\n\n\nThey hit the Break a thousand light-years from Van Maanen's star.\nTravis could see it through the thick, curved window: an oval of\ndarkness somehow shades deeper than the black of space. The pointed\nprow of the spacer steadied, then sped on. The slit grew larger.\n\n\"Pray Grock that Rudra is amusing himself with some new form of life,\"\nNuala whispered, white hand gripping the lever of the speed control.\n\"If he suspects we're entering his little world, he'll scatter our\nremains across the cluster.\"\n\nTravis prowled restlessly around the small room. He felt useless\nbeside Nuala. He glanced at the dials and levers she had improved, at\nthe racked disintegrators that the girl, with a hellish cunning, had\nout-moded by making them into larger replicas of the pencil-guns. His\nhard palms slid down his leather jacket, restless, eager to come to\ngrips with something.\n\nThe Break was on them, and they were in it. Darkness shrouded the ship,\nbut the rockets thundered through the insulation-sheets. Travis upped\nthe lights with a flip of his hand. Even at full brilliance, he saw\nNuala through a pale haze.\n\n\"The Break is a barrier that Rudra threw up around his worlds after he\nsmashed Flormaseron. He has three planets all to himself. One is his\nlaboratory, one his armory, one his palace. We'd have no chance at all\nby attacking the first two. Only on his palace-planet--where he retires\nto his kinds of pleasure--can we surprise him.\"\n\nThe darkness went away and they were back in space again. Far ahead of\nthem a star glittered with blue shimmerings. Faint and distant from the\nstar, tiny gray balls in space, were three planets.\n\nNuala touched a stud on the steel wall. \"A force-sheath,\" she smiled.\n\"We'd never get close enough to the planet to land if we didn't have\nit.\" A whiteness swept up before the windows, hiding the star and the\nthree planets. Nuala moved forward, past Travis. With a touch of her\nfinger, she slipped on the automatic pilot.\n\n\"There. Now we can do nothing else but--wait.\"\n\nThey did not wait long. The humming alarm of the warning buzzer drove\nNuala to the controls. With speeding hands, she upped the force sheath\nstud, depressed the landing lever. Travis was at her side, staring down\nat rolling grasslands, at the distant peak of a snow-topped mountain.\nHe muttered, \"It looks like Earth!\"\n\nThe space-ship rode on its belly across the grass. Travis went to the\ncurved door and flung it open. Sweet cool air drove inside the room on\nthe wings of a breeze.\n\nSomething clanged against the metal doorlock. Hooves drummed on the\ngrass. Another pellet dented the hull of the ship, blew into a thousand\nsplinters. Travis got his face out of the way just in time. His hand\ndropped to his holster, came up with the ringed _stil_-gun that had\nbeen changed over by Nuala. Horsemen were approaching, fast.\n\nHe slammed a finger down on the trigger. Green flame blasted from the\nmuzzle, swept like a cloud across the grasses.\n\nThe horsemen came up the side of a hill, heading for the ship.\nBefore the green light reached them, Travis had a quick look at the\nheavyset, white-skinned men who kneed their mounts, long tubes at their\nshoulders. They looked like barbarians, but they held those queer tubes\nin their hands.\n\nNuala screamed, \"Atholiners! Quick--jump for it!\"\n\nShe was at his side, clutching at his hands. \"Those little\npellets--they'll eat everything they hit. Quick! By Grock ... be quick!\"\n\nTravis had a confused glimpse of her flashing eyes, of a gaping hole\nrapidly spreading along the smooth, metallic side of the ship. His legs\ntensed, and he was jumping. Ahead of him the green light was bathing\nthe horsemen in its verdant flame. A man screamed. The scream gurgled,\ndied abruptly.\n\nHe landed and rolled. He came to his feet, _stil_-gun in hand. The\nhorsemen were just particles of lazily floating dust. Travis turned to\nhis ship, saw it eaten before his eyes, as though an invisible beast\nwere champing on it, taking huge mouthfuls.\n\nThen the ship was gone, and he and Nuala stood alone on the grassy\nknoll.\n\n\"Some surprise party,\" he said, and laughed harshly. \"We have one\ngun--which doesn't mean a thing, if Rudra is anything like you think he\nis.\"\n\n\"Rudra? Yes, we must think of him. He may or may not know we are\nhere.\" She looked about at the windswept knoll, at the gnarled pine\ntrees standing straight and tall, bleak and stern. She glanced away,\ntoward a tier of flattish rocks. \"Sometimes his horsemen take care\nof--intruders. Sometimes he lets visitors--wander. Never has he let\nthem escape him for very long.\"\n\nSomething of the menace of the man beat at Travis, as though a cold\nwind moaned above the pines and blew past his ear with mocking words.\n_Rudra will get you if you don't watch out. Rudra has never let a\nvisitor escape him for very long._\n\nHe put his hands on his _stil_-gun and stroked its rounded grip. \"We\ncan't just stay here. We'd starve to death in these wilds.\" His\nhand indicated the windbent oaks below, the gaunt pines, the rolling\ngrasslands that lifted toward distant hills.\n\nNuala brooded at him. Her red mouth quirked, almost angrily. She\nsnapped, \"I've been thinking! We still can surprise him if we could get\ninto Kovokod, the main city.\"\n\n\"Why not go disguised as some of his people?\" Travis wondered. He\ngrinned, \"You could be my wife--\"\n\nNuala sniffed her contempt. She lashed at him, \"I am above emotions. I\nam almost pure thought. Don't distract me from my planning.\"\n\nTravis chuckled, \"A couple of barbarians. We'd look pretty good as\nnomads, wouldn't we? Well, what do you say? What's to stop us?\"\n\nNuala snapped, \"Our features! They are too delicate, too finely formed.\nRudra hastened the evolution of his people, speeded up their ascent in\ntime. They are still brutish, thick of nose, of lip.\"\n\n\"If we had some of the celluvalin. I could do a pretty fancy job on our\nfaces. I've moulded life forms in clay often enough for Solar Museum.\"\n\nNuala eyed him wonderingly. \"You are a young race, but you Earth-things\ndo come up with some good ideas. There will be medical centers on\nRudraline. If we can find one, there will be celluvalin there.\"\n\nThey set out under the pines, walking for the windbent oaks, side by\nside.\n\n\n\nFor three days they moved southward. Here and there were farms,\nsprawled across the land. Travis walked with his eyes on them, studying\nthe architecture, the terrain. Already, he told himself, he could do a\nfew panoramic windows for Solar--if he ever got out of this thing alive.\n\nOnce Nuala caught him by the wrist, dragged him back to the shelter of\na dwarf bush. She whispered, \"A caravan. The Rudraldians are taking\ntheir produce to market at Kovokod!\"\n\nTravis watched, fascinated. The horsemen in plain leather harness rode\nwith the ease of Cossacks in the saddle, far ahead of the slower-footed\npack-animals, giant sloth-like creatures in rich trappings. They\nbore ornate palanquins on their backs, or pulled huge wagons by\ngilded reins. In the middle of the caravan rode the nobles, draped in\ncloth-of-gold, glittering with jewels.\n\nNuala shook his shoulder. She hissed. \"We can't waste time. Quickly,\nnow. They are almost past--\"\n\nThey scrambled unseen onto a wagon....\n\nThey found a medical station in the dawn of the fourth day. There was\na nurse inside, asleep at the table. Nuala crossed the room with long\nstrides, bent over her from the rear, did something to her at the base\nof the skull with her fingertips. The nurse pitched forward, sprawled\nalong the edge of the table.\n\nTravis scooped handsful of _celluvalin_ from an earthern jar and went\nto work on his face before a mirror. With steady fingers he altered his\nnose, broadened and widened it, gave it a snoutish look. He modeled\nhis mouth to brutish slackness. He lowered his forehead. When he was\nthrough he was a step above the ape.\n\nNuala was watching him with wide eyes. She whispered, \"I do not like\nyou--like that.\"\n\nHe stood over her, toweling his hands. He said, \"I feel different, too.\nAlmost like a--beast.\"\n\nShe was near him, blue eyes uplifted, red mouth quivering. He put his\nhands on her arms, lifted her against him. He bent and kissed her. For\na single instant she yielded to him and her mouth was a honeyed fire.\nThen she thrust him away, stood panting. Her anger crackled in her\neyes, in the rise of her pointed breasts.\n\n\"You are a beast! You--\"\n\nTravis chuckled, \"I just had to do it, honey. I wanted to see what it\nwas like.\"\n\nHe scooped _celluvalin_ in a hand and slapped it down on her cheek.\nHe worked swiftly, moulding and shaping the cell-jelly before it\nhardened and adhered to her skin. By the time he was finished, her\nrage was spent. He stepped back, eyed her calculatingly. He nodded.\n\"You look just like the nurse, now. Not a bad job, if I do ring my own\nalarm-bell.\"\n\nNuala lifted the mirror and looked into it for a long moment. Once she\nlifted her eyes and stared enigmatically at Travis. Then she casually\nlifted a hand and undid the fastenings of her translucent gown. Calmly\nshe stepped from it, ignoring Travis's sudden, \"Hey!\"\n\nShe lifted the white uniform from the prostrate nurse. Deftly she\nhooked it about her and stood back. \"Now the resemblance is complete.\nI will be a nurse. You--my amorous Earth-thing--will be my patient. A\nmental deficient. You look the part perfectly.\"\n\nTravis went, \"Ouch!\" and followed her out into the sunlight.\n\nToward noon they were overtaken on the broad highway by an advance\nguard of horsemen for another caravan. One of the horsemen shouted at\nthem. Nuala screamed back. Not understanding their language--Nuala had\nalways spoken spaceenglish to him--he said, \"What'd they want to know?\"\n\n\"If my _babuvol_ was too poor to buy me a horse,\" she snapped.\n\n\"_Babuvol?_\"\n\n\"Husband to you, Mate. I told them you weren't my husband.\" She added\nsweetly, \"I said you were crazy, that you suffered from the delusion of\nhaving glass toes, among other things.\"\n\nTravis scowled at her as she swung along blithely. He thought of a\nremark, but ignored it.\n\nThe caravan crept up to them, engulfed them. Travis stared rudely at\nthe sleek horses, at the handsomely wrought designs on saddle and\nstirrup. He eyed the monstrous pack-sloths carefully, making sure that\nhe was nowhere near the flat, gigantic paws when they tromped down on\nthe road. He caught sudden glimpses of foodstuffs, of silver jars, of\npriceless tapestries.\n\nOnce a nobleman reined in his mount and spoke to them. Nuala did not\nraise her eyes but she murmured, \"He is a feeble one, lordship. There\nis a sickness in his mind. If you could hear him speak--\"\n\nShe nudged Travis with an elbow, hissed into his ear, \"Say something\nfor the man, idiot!\"\n\nTravis babbled, \"Intry-mintry, look so sly--spaceman, spaceman, in your\neye!\" from the words of a song currently popular on Mars.\n\nThe nobleman made a pitying sound with his lips, ignoring Travis's\nglare. He tossed a ring to Nuala. \"The protection of the Lord Railan,\nnurse.\"\n\nNuala hid the ring in a pocket. Eyes straight ahead, she said to\nTravis, \"It was a happy thought, your passing as a lunatic. It is a\npart that comes easily to you.\"\n\nThe ring was a talisman that hired mounts, servants. The engraved seal\non the circlet opened men's eyes, and when Nuala whispered suavely,\n\"The Lord Railan will pay double ...\" the charm was complete. Soon they\nleft the caravan and went on ahead.\n\n\n\nThe twin towers of Kovokod were banded white and black. They dozed\nin the sunlight above the walled city. Outside the walls were sloped\nlaunching cradles for stratosphere fliers and spacers. Like toys,\npilots and passengers moved from stationhouse to ladders, crossed back\nand forth. Occasionally a police flier spiralled slowly over the ramped\nbuildings and arched levels of the city. Travis could see tri-wheeled\nvehicles speeding back and forth on the raised streets.\n\nNuala gestured and Travis saw a huge gate swarming with men and women\non foot, on horse, or seated luxuriously in the tri-wheelers. \"We'll\nmingle with the crowd. That way, and with the ring, we can get in\neasily enough.\"\n\nTravis gawked at the throngs. Nuala spoke occasionally, and Travis\nknew she was calling attention to his mental state. She was mocking\nhim, but Travis added to her words by singing ribald ditties that were\nfamous from Earth to Centauri. He even made up one about Nuala. Only\nher sudden hiss and pinch brought remembrance that she could speak any\ntongue.\n\nThe guard at the gate eyed the ring and Nuala. He licked his lips at\nher words and let them through. They faded into the crowds, Nuala\nwalking swiftly, not giving Travis a chance to stare at the straight,\nmany-windowed buildings, the ornate balconies, the several roads that\nwere like lattices linking the city together.\n\n\"We must get into one of those towers!\" Nuala hissed. \"They are Rudra's\nlaboratories. There he houses his discoveries, the rarest weapons, the\nfinest engines.\"\n\n\"Maybe the ring--?\"\n\n\"Not for the towers. I know this world, from the crypt. I have spent\ntoo many years spying on Rudra.\"\n\nTravis rubbed his knuckles thoughtfully. He murmured, \"I wanted\nsomething to come to grips with. Maybe I can get you into the tower.\"\n\nThe tower entrance was like a halved egg, bulging out from the straight\nwall of the black-and-white structure. There was no visible means of\nentry. It seemed a sheer rounded oval of stone. Travis stared at it\nuncertainly, walking past.\n\n\"Are you sure?\" he asked Nuala. \"That doesn't look like a door to me!\"\n\n\"What do you know of doors?\" she snapped. \"It opens to vibratory\nimpulses. Walk close enough and it will open--and a blast of power will\nturn you into smoke.\"\n\nTravis fingered his jaw. \"If I walk toward it and just as the thing\nopens I dart aside ... it might miss me.\"\n\n\"A crude approach,\" observed Nuala, but her eyes were thoughtful.\n\nStung, Travis snarled, \"Sometimes you accomplish more by crudeness. If\nthe other guy isn't expecting it.\"\n\nHe would not have done it, if he hadn't felt so helpless and useless\nbeside Nuala. He knew it was foolhardy, even as he ran, right hand\ngoing for the _stil_-gun. In a soberer moment he would have waited,\nhave let her figure out the answer, as she had figured out the other\nanswers.\n\nHis dark hair whipped in the wind that came up the street when he slid\nto a halt. The egg-shaped adit was lifting, disclosing black depths\nbehind it, glittering metal, a running figure.\n\nNuala screamed, but Travis moved before he heard her. The _stil_-gun\nbelched green mist into the darkness. Travis was sliding, scrambling\naside.\n\nLight--dazzling, blinding light--shot out of the glittering metal\nengine just before the green mist touched it. The light was hot.\nCrouched against the wall, face turned away from its brilliance, Travis\nfelt the heat of it. His brow beaded with sweat. The black hairs on his\nforearms stank where they crisped.\n\nNuala went by him, crying, \"Now! Now!\"\n\nStaggering, he followed her. She went into the blackness, was a pool\nof whiteness for an instant. He came low and fast on her heels. The\nclosing doors scraped his leg, it was that close.\n\nThe engine that spit the light beam was gone. There was just a gaping\nhole in the metal floor, a bent armature pulled loose from its housing,\na glob of red flesh....\n\nNuala was on the staircase, going up. Travis saw a Kovokodan face\nleer at her, saw a tube lifted. He showered the face with green mist,\nwatched it explode, blow into powder. Then he was beside her, thrusting\nher back.\n\n\"I'll take the lead,\" he growled.\n\nHe used the _stil_-gun twice more before they reached the big chamber\nat the top of the tower. Facing death, taking risks, using the muscles\nof his space-hardened body, Travis felt the elixir of battle pound in\nhis veins. He was a person again, not just a thing dragged along by the\nlast woman of the Nekkalad.\n\nNuala went by him as he stood in the doorway. She raced to banks\nof buttons spread across the western wall of the room. Her fingers\nslammed down, played like the digits of a Venusian pianist across the\ncomplicated keyboard.\n\nShe was just in time. The floor shuddered under their feet as the tower\nrocked. But the floor held. And the tower stood. Nuala threw back her\nhead, flung wild and eerie laughter at the flat ceiling.\n\n\"By Grock, I've won! I've _won_!\"\n\nShe put trembling fingers to her face, clawed at it, tearing strips of\nflesh away. Travis opened his mouth, closed it. Bit by bit, she pulled\nthe _celluvalin_ loose and cast it from her. She swung about, faced\nTravis. Once more her face was lovely, mouth warm and kissable.\n\n\"You helped me, Earth-thing. You helped me get here! I'll reward you\nfor that!\" She lifted her arms, did a girlish pirouette.\n\nTravis growled, \"What about Rudra?\"\n\nShe laughed. It was like tuned glass tinkling. \"Rudra himself\ndiscovered the warp-sheath. I've pulled this tower into another\ndimension. He can't harm us because he can't find us! Oh, Travis, my\ndear....\"\n\nHer hands touched his nose and mouth. Gently she removed the\n_celluvalin_, cleansed his cheeks until he stood tan and grim-lipped,\nthe Clark Travis she first had seen in the pink barrier outside the\ncalyx chamber.\n\n\"Now, Clark Travis ... you may kiss me!\"\n\nHe stretched out his arms, caught her warm and soft against him, bent\nhis mouth--\n\n\"Charming,\" sneered a cold voice. \"Of the _kovokodans_, this I would\nhave expected, but you two are from a higher race--\"\n\n\n\nHe stood in the center of the room, tall and lean; his height and\nspareness emphasized by the black cloak he pulled about him as though\nagainst the cold. His thin lips sneered. The narrow brows above black\neyes were upraised to form two living insults.\n\nNuala whimpered. She thrust a hand to her mouth. \"Rudra!\"\n\nThe dark man moved forward. Now Travis could see a circlet of tiny\nstars, revolving and shimmering, coruscating light, that swung like a\nfallen halo about his head. As the man went, so went the ever-turning\nstars.\n\n\"You know me? But you must, to be so familiar with my sciences. I do\nnot know ... you. Or do I?\"\n\nThe black eyes touched Travis, slid away. Travis growled low in his\nthroat at the blank dismissal of those eyes. He was less than a slug,\nnot given as much courtesy as a canal-minnow. Nuala was shrinking back\nagainst his chest as the eyes drove into her.\n\nRudra whispered, \"But--_you_! You are familiar. Something from out\nof the past ... the dead past ... centuries ... eons ... ages ago. A\nwoman--a queen--Nuatha of the Yellow Hair. Queen of the Nekkalad!\"\n\n\"I am Nuala. Her daughter.\"\n\nRudra looked interested. Nuala went on, \"Before you smashed\nFlormaseron, my parents and the Nekkalad scientists imprisoned me in\nyour own crystal crypt. They fed me energy ... and the thought-waves of\nall living things. I know of you, Rudra, of your plans....\"\n\nThe dark man laughed. \"By my beginning! I am knowing the first interest\nI've had in a thousand million centuries. You've set yourself up\nagainst--me? Against the eternal one? The Werwile?\"\n\nNuala moved her white fingers in a queer pattern. They seemed to blur\nbefore Travis's eyes, become faint and shadowy. Her hand disappeared.\nRudra moved suddenly, swore by a long-forgotten god. He said abruptly,\n\"You'd pull my heart into a different space-time, would you? Leave me\nlocked forever in some blackness?\"\n\nHis own hands moved, but Nuala was quicker. Her body swayed, twisted in\nodd manner. She disappeared. Rudra cried out. He brought his hand back\nto view again. There were teethmarks and blood on it. Nuala formed,\nlaughed softly beside Travis; blood on her ruby mouth.\n\n\"Am I a fit opponent, Rudra--not-long-to-be-eternal?\"\n\nRudra nursed his bitten hand in the black cloak. His black eyes\nglittered dangerously above the beaked nose, the ruddy mouth. Travis\nthought he looked like a cornered Saturnian vampire at that moment.\n\nRudra laughed. It was, surprisingly, a pleasant laugh. He bowed, and\nthere was no mockery in it.\n\n\"You are a worthy opponent, Nuala. None that I know of could have done\nthat to me--but you. You say you know my plans? Good! You know my\nthoughts, my sciences? Good again. Two equal opponents--you with that\ncreature beside you to aid you, me with my _kovokodans_. Let us see who\nwill turn the tide....\n\n\"I had the Lord Railan and others ease your way to me. I was--curious.\nNow I am glad. I will enjoy our duel, Nuala. Good--hunting!\"\n\nHe was gone.\n\nThe silence was cold, as though his passing had taken a fire from the\nroom. Nuala shivered, looked dubiously at Travis. He said tactlessly,\n\"I thought you said you'd won.\"\n\n\"I--underestimated him. I'd forgotten that Rudra smashed Flormaseron,\nthat he has all the science that ever was at his fingertips. I thought\nthat by taking his tower into another dimension I could strike at him\nbefore he knew where we were. Strike and annihilate! Now ... I do not\nknow.\"\n\nThere was doubt in the blue eyes, and the old fear. Only the fear was\nstronger, now. It was a curiously tangible thing, beating out and\naround the room, running chilled tentacles down Travis's back.\n\nHe shook himself, said savagely, \"So we can't surprise him. Then let's\nslug it out, toe to toe. It's him or--us!\"\n\n\"But he has so many sciences ...\" she wailed.\n\n\"Sciences you know just as well!\" Travis snapped. \"And before we're\nover it'll be the first law of nature all over again. The survival\nof--the fittest!\"\n\n\"If I only knew what he meant to do--\"\n\nTravis choked. He put out a hand, vised it on her arm. \"The crypt! By\nthe eternal! If you could move this tower into another dimension--move\nit to Flormaseron! Enter the calyx! Tap his mind! Checkmate him!\"\n\nHope dawned in the blue eyes. Hope stilled the shudder rippling\ndown her back. She cried, \"Yes, yes. That's our chance, our one big\nweapon--the calyx!\"\n\nNuala moved her hands in that queer, flowing motion. Her eyes were\nwide and staring. She whispered, \"It is easier to move the warping\ncontrols--this way. The distances in the dimensional flows are shorter.\"\n\nThere was a faint dizziness as the tower reeled. Travis had an odd\ninstant of vision, where he saw whirling clouds of elfin dust, heard\nthe discordant music of distorted space. In mind's eye, he glimpsed the\ntower as it swung through a blackness striped with red traceries. There\nwas a jar, a sudden shock--\n\n\n\nA wall of the tower shone with iridescent nacre. Through the pale pearl\nglitter, Travis saw the chamber of the calyx, the cones and globes\ncircling endlessly and shedding their soft light, the great sculped-out\nhollow of the crystal.\n\n\"Step quickly,\" whispered Nuala. \"Step through....\"\n\nShe was a blur of movement, leaping for the nacre. Travis clutched for\nher hand and found it warm and soft as he hit the shimmer with her. A\nmoment of cold, then they were inside the crystal crypt. Nuala went to\nthe crystal, lay down within it, attached wires to grips, rested her\ngolden head against the oddly wrought headpiece that was wired to the\ndynamos.\n\nTravis watched her hands lift and blur as a faint, nauseous color came\nseeping up through the very stones of the floor. Travis knew that some\nlight-colors could affect people physically, but this was sickening,\noverpowering. Much of that color, and he would go mad. His brain\nreeled. His stomach writhed--\n\nThe light went away, but Nuala's hands were still invisible, as she\nworked the forces hidden within the captured tower. Travis knew\nshe was hitting back at Rudra, reading his mind, searching for and\nfinding the counter-agent, the necessary checkmate. Her eyes opened a\nsecond, looked into his. She whispered, \"Watch the screen, Travis. The\nscreen....\"\n\nHe could see now what she was doing. The west wall of the tower that\nappeared through the nacre light was a giant visiscreen. In it the\ntower of Rudra in his city of Kovokod stood like a blackened giant\nabove the ruins of the leveled city. Stone buildings were tossed\nand flattened. Smoke eddied upward in huge billows from charred and\nstark stumps of buildings. A woman fled with clothes ablaze along\nthe upended stones of what had been a broad street. From the black\nand sullen sky red and fiery balls rolled and thundered, broke and\nsplashed, devouring, on the city. The balls toppled walls, exploding;\nate up wooden buildings with flaming tongues, caught and engulfed human\nbeings, burning.\n\nSickened, Travis turned away--\n\nIt caught him, then. Bent and flung him back. Staring, he saw Nuala\nhalf out of the crystal block, rigid and writhing, twisted and\ndistorted by some queer force. Her red mouth drew back in agony,\nscreams gurgling in her throat.\n\nAnd bent and twisted in her likeness, straining until their molecules\nwhined, were the dynamos and cones and globes.\n\n\"Magnetic ... flux ... by Grock! Grock!\" she screamed. \"I can't hang\non. It's got me. Grock ... good Grock....\"\n\nTravis dove to yank her free--and ran into it. He felt it in his\nfingers, first. It was a maddening wrench that bent them as if they\nhad been boneless. He leaped sideways and the thing caught him in the\nmiddle. On hands and knees he crawled away, crawled toward the only\nspot that offered safety.\n\nHe slid into the nacre coldness, dropped onto the stone floor of the\ncaptured tower. Sobbing, he lay there, listening to Nuala scream.\n\n_This is the end of it. There is no way out_--\n\nNo way out. Only death from torture. Or--maybe not death. Just torture\nfor Nuala. He remembered the pink and menacing girdle that secured the\ncrypt from the _arklings_. The unseen voices, recorded somehow by the\nfirst humanoid race, had told of tortures--_Nuala, stop screaming! God,\nI can't stand it!_\n\nNuala, screaming. And Rudra--gloating!\n\nRudra!\n\nTravis lifted his tanned face. His eyes burned savagely, staring across\nthe tower toward the dials and levers that controlled those forces\nthat only Rudra and Nuala understood. Travis moved his hands, getting\nto his feet. He looked at his hands, balled them into hard fists.\nHe whispered, \"I wanted something to come to grips with. I needed\nsomething to put my hands on, to hit, to batter!\"\n\nTravis snarled, \"Rudra!\" and slammed his hands on the levers. He had\nwatched Nuala move them. He knew how to move the tower through the\ndimensional paths Nuala had guided it.\n\nUnder his feet the tower swayed, reeled sickeningly.\n\nAnd then--\n\nThe two towers met with a jarring crash. Travis was already in midair,\nleaping through the gap. Stones met and tumbled. The roof of Rudra's\nblackened tower was caving in. Travis swept through the air, aimed for\na crumbled section of roofing. His hands went out to fasten on smashed\ntile. Through the rent, he saw Rudra at his visiscreen, laughing at the\ntwisted, helpless thing that was Nuala in the calyx--\n\n\n\nTravis went mad. He leaped for Rudra, leaped from the roof. His fist\ncaught him beside the cheek, drove his head back. His knees hit the\nman's chest as he fell, toppled him backward. Sobbing, Travis went for\nhim even before he hit the floor.\n\nThey rolled across the tiling, bounced off the metal leg of a table,\nrammed into the base of the great visiscreen. Travis fought with\nthe strength of a hundred men, thinking of the crumpled loveliness\nof Nuala. His fists were as ten. His endurance seemed drawn from a\nbottomless well of energy. He fought and hammered and sobbed, a red\nhaze of fury floating before his eyes.\n\nAnd Rudra weathered the storm. The stars that circled about his head\nglowed brighter and brighter. Strength grew and grew in Rudra's body.\nHe broke free of Travis, thrust him back with a vicious kick: laughed\nat him. He moved his hands in the fluid motion and there was blind,\nstabbing pain in Travis's guts, an agony that lanced red-hot needles\nfrom the roots of his hair to his toenails.\n\nTravis rolled on the floor, clutching his broken body. He saw legs, hit\nthem. Rudra fell over him.\n\nTravis summoned all his strength, tore loose from the pain inside him,\nfell on Rudra. The revolving stars cut his lip, blinded him with their\nbrilliance.\n\nIt was a voice whispering inside him, like Nuala's voice. \"_The\nstar-girdle is his weakness. Break the stars and you break Rudra.\nWithout the stars, Rudra is_--nothing!\"\n\nTravis lifted his hands and closed them on the stars. Rudra whispered.\nFor the first time, Travis detected fear in the man's eyes. He tried to\nwrench free, brought his hands back from inside Travis, scrabbled for\nhis wrists.\n\nSilently they struggled there. The pain was gone and Travis knew that\nthis was it. He had to win now, or not at all. Now ... _now_....\n\nThe stars came free. They whispered sibilantly, loosening in their\norbit, shooting wildly across the room. They stung and bit into\nTravis's hands. They whirled, exploding into puffs of silvery dust.\nThe dust showered down on Rudra, on Travis. It stung the nostrils, the\neyeballs....\n\n\"Rudra!\" whispered Travis.\n\nThere was no Rudra, only a widening glob of black wetness, melting away\nas wax melts from a candle in fierce heat. Travis rolled free, slapped\nat the blackish stains on spaceslacks and jacket.\n\nThe blob of jelly loosened rapidly, went to liquid as a breeze swept\nover the ruined city and into the blasted tower. The liquid ran freely,\nwent down the cracks, dripped wetly on the rafters and the stones far\nbelow.\n\n_Ancient! Ancient! So old the tongues of men had no word for it. From\nthe beginning he was, and was no more...._\n\nTravis turned away from the stench. He stumbled across the room toward\nthe control levers on the wall. With trembling hands he shut them off.\n\n\n\nIt was easy, going back. Through the nacre curtain, as the tower\nsettled down, Travis saw Nuala standing beside the shattered calyx.\nBoth hands were plunged in her thick golden hair. Her blue eyes were\nblank and staring.\n\nHer memory is gone, Travis thought, running toward her. The pain and\nthe magnetic flux did it. She isn't Nuala of the crystal crypt any\nlonger. She is only a girl.\n\nHis dream of Nuala cooking a _jalanadon_ steak in his little apartment\nat Mars Port would come true. This Nuala he could marry.\n\nTravis caught her in his arms. Her lips were sweet as he bent and\nkissed her.",
