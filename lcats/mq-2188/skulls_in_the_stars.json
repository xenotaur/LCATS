    "body": "There are two roads to Torkertown. One, the shorter and more direct\nroute, leads across a barren upland moor, and the other, which is\nmuch longer, winds its tortuous way in and out among the hummocks and\nquagmires of the swamps, skirting the low hills to the east. It was a\ndangerous and tedious trail; so Solomon Kane halted in amazement when\na breathless youth from the village he had just left, overtook him and\nimplored him for God's sake to take the swamp road.\n\n\"The swamp road!\" Kane stared at the boy.\n\nHe was a tall, gaunt man, was Solomon Kane, his darkly pallid face and\ndeep brooding eyes made more somber by the drab Puritanical garb he\naffected.\n\n\"Yes, sir, 'tis far safer,\" the youngster answered his surprized\nexclamation.\n\n\"Then the moor road must be haunted by Satan himself, for your townsmen\nwarned me against traversing the other.\"\n\n\"Because of the quagmires, sir, that you might not see in the dark.\nYou had better return to the village and continue your journey in the\nmorning, sir.\"\n\n\"Taking the swamp road?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nKane shrugged his shoulders and shook his head.\n\n\"The moon rises almost as soon as twilight dies. By its light I can\nreach Torkertown in a few hours, across the moor.\"\n\n\"Sir, you had better not. No one ever goes that way. There are no\nhouses at all upon the moor, while in the swamp there is the house of\nold Ezra who lives there all alone since his maniac cousin, Gideon,\nwandered off and died in the swamp and was never found--and old Ezra\nthough a miser would not refuse you lodging should you decide to stop\nuntil morning. Since you must go, you had better go the swamp road.\"\n\nKane eyed the boy piercingly. The lad squirmed and shuffled his feet.\n\n\"Since this moor road is so dour to wayfarers,\" said the Puritan,\n\"why did not the villagers tell me the whole tale, instead of vague\nmouthings?\"\n\n\"Men like not to talk of it, sir. We hoped that you would take the\nswamp road after the men advised you to, but when we watched and saw\nthat you turned not at the forks, they sent me to run after you and beg\nyou to reconsider.\"\n\n\"Name of the Devil!\" exclaimed Kane sharply, the unaccustomed oath\nshowing his irritation; \"the swamp road and the moor road--what is it\nthat threatens me and why should I go miles out of my way and risk the\nbogs and mires?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said the boy, dropping his voice and drawing closer, \"we be\nsimple villagers who like not to talk of such things lest foul fortune\nbefall us, but the moor road is a way accurst and hath not been\ntraversed by any of the countryside for a year or more. It is death\nto walk those moors by night, as hath been found by some score of\nunfortunates. Some foul horror haunts the way and claims men for his\nvictims.\"\n\n\"So? And what is this thing like?\"\n\n\"No man knows. None has ever seen it and lived, but late-farers\nhave heard terrible laughter far out on the fen and men have heard\nthe horrid shrieks of its victims. Sir, in God's name return to the\nvillage, there pass the night, and tomorrow take the swamp trail to\nTorkertown.\"\n\nFar back in Kane's gloomy eyes a scintillant light had begun to\nglimmer, like a witch's torch glinting under fathoms of cold gray ice.\nHis blood quickened. Adventure! The lure of life-risk and battle! The\nthrill of breathtaking, touch-and-go drama! Not that Kane recognized\nhis sensations as such. He sincerely considered that he voiced his real\nfeelings when he said:\n\n\"These things be deeds of some power of evil. The lords of darkness\nhave laid a curse upon the country. A strong man is needed to combat\nSatan and his might. Therefore I go, who have defied him many a time.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" the boy began, then closed his mouth as he saw the futility of\nargument. He only added, \"The corpses of the victims are bruised and\ntorn, sir.\"\n\nHe stood there at the crossroads, sighing regretfully as he watched the\ntall, rangy figure swinging up the road that led toward the moors.\n\n\n\nThe sun was setting as Kane came over the brow of the low hill which\ndebouched into the upland fen. Huge and blood-red it sank down behind\nthe sullen horizon of the moors, seeming to touch the rank grass with\nfire; so for a moment the watcher seemed to be gazing out across a sea\nof blood. Then the dark shadows came gliding from the east, the western\nblaze faded, and Solomon Kane struck out boldly in the gathering\ndarkness.\n\nThe road was dim from disuse but was clearly defined. Kane went swiftly\nbut warily, sword and pistols at hand. Stars blinked out and night\nwinds whispered among the grass like weeping specters. The moon began\nto rise, lean and haggard, like a skull among the stars.\n\nThen suddenly Kane stopped short. From somewhere in front of him\nsounded a strange and eery echo--or something like an echo. Again,\nthis time louder. Kane started forward again. Were his senses deceiving\nhim? No!\n\nFar out, there pealed a whisper of frightful laughter. And again,\ncloser this time. No human being ever laughed like that--there was no\nmirth in it, only hatred and horror and soul-destroying terror. Kane\nhalted. He was not afraid, but for the second he was almost unnerved.\nThen, stabbing through that awesome laughter, came the sound of a\nscream that was undoubtedly human. Kane started forward, increasing his\ngait. He cursed the illusive lights and flickering shadows which veiled\nthe moor in the rising moon and made accurate sight impossible. The\nlaughter continued, growing louder, as did the screams. Then sounded\nfaintly the drum of frantic human feet. Kane broke into a run.\n\nSome human was being hunted to his death out there on the fen, and by\nwhat manner of horror God alone knew. The sound of the flying feet\nhalted abruptly and the screaming rose unbearably, mingled with other\nsounds unnamable and hideous. Evidently the man had been overtaken, and\nKane, his flesh crawling, visualized some ghastly fiend of the darkness\ncrouching on the back of its victim--crouching and tearing.\n\nThen the noise of a terrible and short struggle came clearly through\nthe abysmal silence of the fen and the footfalls began again, but\nstumbling and uneven. The screaming continued, but with a gasping\ngurgle. The sweat stood cold on Kane's forehead and body. This was\nheaping horror on horror in an intolerable manner.\n\nGod, for a moment's clear light! The frightful drama was being enacted\nwithin a very short distance of him, to judge by the ease with which\nthe sounds reached him. But this hellish half-light veiled all in\nshifting shadows, so that the moors appeared a haze of blurred\nillusions, and stunted trees and bushes seemed like giants.\n\nKane shouted, striving to increase the speed of his advance. The\nshrieks of the unknown broke into a hideous shrill squealing; again\nthere was the sound of a struggle, and then from the shadows of the\ntall grass a thing came reeling--a thing that had once been a man--a\ngore-covered, frightful thing that fell at Kane's feet and writhed and\ngroveled and raised its terrible face to the rising moon, and gibbered\nand yammered, and fell down again and died in its own blood.\n\nThe moon was up now and the light was better. Kane bent above the body,\nwhich lay stark in its unnamable mutilation, and he shuddered--a rare\nthing for him, who had seen the deeds of the Spanish Inquisition and\nthe witch-finders.\n\nSome wayfarer, he supposed. Then like a hand of ice on his spine he\nwas aware that he was not alone. He looked up, his cold eyes piercing\nthe shadows whence the dead man had staggered. He saw nothing, but\nhe knew--he felt--that other eyes gave back his stare, terrible eyes\nnot of this earth. He straightened and drew a pistol, waiting. The\nmoonlight spread like a lake of pale blood over the moor, and trees and\ngrasses took on their proper sizes.\n\nThe shadows melted, and Kane _saw_! At first he thought it only a\nshadow of mist, a wisp of moor fog that swayed in the tall grass\nbefore him. He gazed. More illusion, he thought. Then the thing began\nto take on shape, vague and indistinct. Two hideous eyes flamed at\nhim--eyes which held all the stark horror which has been the heritage\nof man since the fearful dawn ages--eyes frightful and insane, with an\ninsanity transcending earthly insanity. The form of the thing was misty\nand vague, a brain-shattering travesty on the human form, like, yet\nhorridly unlike. The grass and bushes beyond showed clearly through it.\n\nKane felt the blood pound in his temples, yet he was as cold as ice.\nHow such an unstable being as that which wavered before him could harm\na man in a physical way was more than he could understand, yet the red\nhorror at his feet gave mute testimony that the fiend could act with\nterrible material effect.\n\nOf one thing Kane was sure: there would be no hunting of him across the\ndreary moors, no screaming and fleeing to be dragged down again and\nagain. If he must die he would die in his tracks, his wounds in front.\n\nNow a vague and grisly mouth gaped wide and the demoniac laughter again\nshrieked out, soul-shaking in its nearness. And in the midst of that\nthreat of doom, Kane deliberately leveled his long pistol and fired. A\nmaniacal yell of rage and mockery answered the report, and the thing\ncame at him like a flying sheet of smoke, long shadowy arms stretched\nto drag him down.\n\nKane, moving with the dynamic speed of a famished wolf, fired the\nsecond pistol with as little effect, snatched his long rapier from its\nsheath and thrust into the center of the misty attacker. The blade sang\nas it passed clear through, encountering no solid resistance, and Kane\nfelt icy fingers grip his limbs, bestial talons tear his garments and\nthe skin beneath.\n\nHe dropped the useless sword and sought to grapple with his foe. It was\nlike fighting a floating mist, a flying shadow armed with daggerlike\nclaws. His savage blows met empty air, his leanly mighty arms, in whose\ngrasp strong men had died, swept nothingness and clutched emptiness.\nNaught was solid or real save the flaying, apelike fingers with their\ncrooked talons, and the crazy eyes which burned into the shuddering\ndepths of his soul.\n\nKane realized that he was in a desperate plight indeed. Already his\ngarments hung in tatters and he bled from a score of deep wounds. But\nhe never flinched, and the thought of flight never entered his mind. He\nhad never fled from a single foe, and had the thought occurred to him\nhe would have flushed with shame.\n\nHe saw no help for it now, but that his form should lie there beside\nthe fragments of the other victim, but the thought held no terrors\nfor him. His only wish was to give as good an account of himself as\npossible before the end came, and if he could, to inflict some damage\non his unearthly foe.\n\nThere above the dead man's torn body, man fought with demon under the\npale light of the rising moon, with all the advantages with the demon,\nsave one. And that one was enough to overcome all the others. For if\nabstract hate may bring into material substance a ghostly thing, may\nnot courage, equally abstract, form a concrete weapon to combat that\nghost?\n\nKane fought with his arms and his feet and his hands, and he was aware\nat last that the ghost began to give back before him, that the fearful\nlaughter changed to screams of baffled fury. For man's only weapon is\ncourage that flinches not from the gates of Hell itself, and against\nsuch not even the legions of Hell can stand.\n\nOf this Kane knew nothing; he only knew that the talons which tore and\nrended him seemed to grow weaker and wavering, that a wild light grew\nand grew in the horrible eyes. And reeling and gasping, he rushed in,\ngrappled the thing at last and threw it, and as they tumbled about on\nthe moor and it writhed and lapped his limbs like a serpent of smoke,\nhis flesh crawled and his hair stood on end, for he began to understand\nits gibbering.\n\nHe did not hear and comprehend as a man hears and comprehends the\nspeech of a man, but the frightful secrets it imparted in whisperings\nand yammerings and screaming silences sank fingers of ice and flame\ninto his soul, and he _knew_.\n\n\n\n\n                                   2\n\n\nThe hut of old Ezra the miser stood by the road in the midst of the\nswamp, half screened by the sullen trees which grew about it. The\nwalls were rotting, the roof crumbling, and great, pallid and green\nfungus-monsters clung to it and writhed about the doors and windows,\nas if seeking to peer within. The trees leaned above it and their gray\nbranches intertwined so that it crouched in the semi-darkness like a\nmonstrous dwarf over whose shoulder ogres leer.\n\nThe road which wound down into the swamp, among rotting stumps and\nrank hummocks and scummy, snake-haunted pools and bogs, crawled past\nthe hut. Many people passed that way these days, but few saw old Ezra,\nsave a glimpse of a yellow face, peering through the fungus-screened\nwindows, itself like an ugly fungus.\n\nOld Ezra the miser partook much of the quality of the swamp, for he was\ngnarled and bent and sullen; his fingers were like clutching parasitic\nplants and his locks hung like drab moss above eyes trained to the\nmurk of the swamplands. His eyes were like a dead man's, yet hinted of\ndepths abysmal and loathsome as the dead lakes of the swamplands.\n\nThese eyes gleamed now at the man who stood in front of his hut. This\nman was tall and gaunt and dark, his face was haggard and claw-marked,\nand he was bandaged of arm and leg. Somewhat behind this man stood a\nnumber of villagers.\n\n\"You are Ezra of the swamp road?\"\n\n\"Aye, and what want ye of me?\"\n\n\"Where is your cousin Gideon, the maniac youth who abode with you?\"\n\n\"Gideon?\"\n\n\"Aye.\"\n\n\"He wandered away into the swamp and never came back. No doubt he lost\nhis way and was set upon by wolves or died in a quagmire or was struck\nby an adder.\"\n\n\"How long ago?\"\n\n\"Over a year.\"\n\n\"Aye. Hark ye, Ezra the miser. Soon after your cousin's disappearance,\na countryman, coming home across the moors, was set upon by some\nunknown fiend and torn to pieces, and thereafter it became death to\ncross those moors. First men of the countryside, then strangers who\nwandered over the fen, fell to the clutches of the thing. Many men have\ndied, since the first one.\n\n\"Last night I crossed the moors, and heard the flight and pursuing of\nanother victim, a stranger who knew not the evil of the moors. Ezra\nthe miser, it was a fearful thing, for the wretch twice broke from the\nfiend, terribly wounded, and each time the demon caught and dragged him\ndown again. And at last he fell dead at my very feet, done to death in\na manner that would freeze the statue of a saint.\"\n\nThe villagers moved restlessly and murmured fearfully to each other,\nand old Ezra's eyes shifted furtively. Yet the somber expression\nof Solomon Kane never altered, and his condor-like stare seemed to\ntransfix the miser.\n\n\"Aye, aye!\" muttered old Ezra hurriedly; \"a bad thing, a bad thing! Yet\nwhy do you tell this thing to me?\"\n\n\"Aye, a sad thing. Harken further, Ezra. The fiend came out of the\nshadows and I fought with it, over the body of its victim. Aye, how\nI overcame it, I know not, for the battle was hard and long, but the\npowers of good and light were on my side, which are mightier than the\npowers of Hell.\n\n\"At the last I was stronger, and it broke from me and fled, and I\nfollowed to no avail. Yet before it fled it whispered to me a monstrous\ntruth.\"\n\nOld Ezra started, stared wildly, seemed to shrink into himself.\n\n\"Nay, why tell me this?\" he muttered.\n\n\"I returned to the village and told my tale,\" said Kane, \"for I knew\nthat now I had the power to rid the moors of its curse forever. Ezra,\ncome with us!\"\n\n\"Where?\" gasped the miser.\n\n\"_To the rotting oak on the moors._\"\n\nEzra reeled as though struck; he screamed incoherently and turned to\nflee.\n\nOn the instant, at Kane's sharp order, two brawny villagers sprang\nforward and seized the miser. They twisted the dagger from his withered\nhand, and pinioned his arms, shuddering as their fingers encountered\nhis clammy flesh.\n\nKane motioned them to follow, and turning strode up the trail, followed\nby the villagers, who found their strength taxed to the utmost in their\ntask of bearing their prisoner along. Through the swamp they went and\nout, taking a little-used trail which led up over the low hills and out\non the moors.\n\n\n\nThe sun was sliding down the horizon and old Ezra stared at it with\nbulging eyes--stared as if he could not gaze enough. Far out on the\nmoors reared up the great oak tree, like a gibbet, now only a decaying\nshell. There Solomon Kane halted.\n\nOld Ezra writhed in his captor's grasp and made inarticulate noises.\n\n\"Over a year ago,\" said Solomon Kane, \"you, fearing that your insane\ncousin Gideon would tell men of your cruelties to him, brought him away\nfrom the swamp by the very trail by which we came, and murdered him\nhere in the night.\"\n\nEzra cringed and snarled.\n\n\"You can not prove this lie!\"\n\nKane spoke a few words to an agile villager. The youth clambered up the\nrotting bole of the tree and from a crevice, high up, dragged something\nthat fell with a clatter at the feet of the miser. Ezra went limp with\na terrible shriek.\n\nThe object was a man's skeleton, the skull cleft.\n\n\"You--how knew you this? You are Satan!\" gibbered old Ezra.\n\nKane folded his arms.\n\n\"The thing I fought last night told me this thing as we reeled in\nbattle, and I followed it to this tree. _For the fiend is Gideon's\nghost._\"\n\nEzra shrieked again and fought savagely.\n\n\"You knew,\" said Kane somberly, \"you knew what thing did these deeds.\nYou feared the ghost of the maniac, and that is why you chose to leave\nhis body on the fen instead of concealing it in the swamp. For you knew\nthe ghost would haunt the place of his death. He was insane in life,\nand in death he did not know where to find his slayer; else he had come\nto you in your hut. He hates no man but you, but his mazed spirit can\nnot tell one man from another, and he slays all, lest he let his killer\nescape. Yet he will know you and rest in peace forever after. Hate hath\nmade of his ghost a solid thing that can rend and slay, and though he\nfeared you terribly in life, in death he fears you not.\"\n\nKane halted. He glanced at the sun.\n\n\"All this I had from Gideon's ghost, in his yammerings and his\nwhisperings and his shrieking silences. Naught but your death will lay\nthat ghost.\"\n\nEzra listened in breathless silence and Kane pronounced the words of\nhis doom.\n\n\"A hard thing it is,\" said Kane somberly, \"to sentence a man to death\nin cold blood and in such a manner as I have in mind, but you must die\nthat others may live--and God knoweth you deserve death.\n\n\"You shall not die by noose, bullet or sword, but at the talons of him\nyou slew--for naught else will satiate him.\"\n\nAt these words Ezra's brain shattered, his knees gave way and he\nfell groveling and screaming for death, begging them to burn him at\nthe stake, to flay him alive. Kane's face was set like death, and the\nvillagers, the fear rousing their cruelty, bound the screeching wretch\nto the oak tree, and one of them bade him make his peace with God. But\nEzra made no answer, shrieking in a high shrill voice with unbearable\nmonotony. Then the villager would have struck the miser across the\nface, but Kane stayed him.\n\n\"Let him make his peace with Satan, whom he is more like to meet,\" said\nthe Puritan grimly. \"The sun is about to set. Loose his cords so that\nhe may work loose by dark, since it is better to meet death free and\nunshackled than bound like a sacrifice.\"\n\nAs they turned to leave him, old Ezra yammered and gibbered unhuman\nsounds and then fell silent, staring at the sun with terrible intensity.\n\nThey walked away across the fen, and Kane flung a last look at the\ngrotesque form bound to the tree, seeming in the uncertain light like\na great fungus growing to the bole. And suddenly the miser screamed\nhideously:\n\n\"Death! Death! There are skulls in the stars!\"\n\n\"Life was good to him, though he was gnarled and churlish and evil,\"\nKane sighed. \"Mayhap God has a place for such souls where fire and\nsacrifice may cleanse them of their dross as fire cleans the forest of\nfungous things. Yet my heart is heavy within me.\"\n\n\"Nay, sir,\" one of the villagers spoke, \"you have done but the will of\nGod, and good alone shall come of this night's deed.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" answered Kane heavily, \"I know not--I know not.\"\n\n\n\nThe sun had gone down and night spread with amazing swiftness, as if\ngreat shadows came rushing down from unknown voids to cloak the world\nwith hurrying darkness. Through the thick night came a weird echo, and\nthe men halted and looked back the way they had come.\n\nNothing could be seen. The moor was an ocean of shadows and the tall\ngrass about them bent in long waves before the faint wind, breaking the\ndeathly stillness with breathless murmurings.\n\nThen far away the red disk of the moon rose over the fen, and for an\ninstant a grim silhouette was etched blackly against it. A shape came\nflying across the face of the moon--a bent, grotesque thing whose feet\nseemed scarcely to touch the earth; and close behind came a thing like\na flying shadow--a nameless, shapeless horror.\n\nA moment the racing twain stood out boldly against the moon; then they\nmerged into one unnamable, formless mass, and vanished in the shadows.\n\nFar across the fen sounded a single shriek of terrible laughter.",
