Can\u2019t you tell us something new?\n\nSAM\u2014But, Pa, how are we going to get to town to buy our Christmas\npresents and things?\n\nPA (_gruffly_)\u2014We can\u2019t go and that\u2019s all about it. The horses couldn\u2019t\nplow half a rod through these snowdrifts.\n\nSAM\u2014But whatever are we going to do for Christmas?\n\nMA (_shaking her head_)\u2014I guess we will have to do without Christmas\nthis year.\n\n_Minerva enters_\n\nMINERVA\u2014Do without Christmas! Oh, Ma!\n\nMA (_brushing away tears_)\u2014I\u2019m sorry Minerva, but with the twins down\nwith the grippe last week and it snowing so hard this week we couldn\u2019t\nget to town and\u2014and (_puts apron to eye_). I feel every bit as bad\nas you youngsters. I\u2019ve always prided myself on giving you a happy\nChristmas, and to think that I haven\u2019t a thing ready this year. Oh, you\npoor, poor children (_cries_).\n\nPA\u2014Now, see what you\u2019ve done. Run away children and stop pesterin\u2019 your\nMa.\n\nMINERVA (_kissing Ma_)\u2014Never mind, Ma. We know it couldn\u2019t be helped.\nWe can do one year without Christmas, can\u2019t we, Sam?\n\nSAM (_patting Ma awkwardly_)\u2014Of course. Don\u2019t you worry about us kids,\nMa. We\u2019ll get along.\n\nMA\u2014Bless your dear, kind hearts. But the little ones, the twins, how\ncan I tell them that Santa can\u2019t come this year?\n\nPA\u2014Those kids have got enough toys as it is to last them a life time.\nLook at this room. You\u2019d think a hurricane had struck it.\n\nMA\u2014I know, I know. But they\u2019ve been stuck in the house so long that\nthey\u2019re bound to get their play things around. It\u2019s not the toys they\nneed, but to tell them Santa won\u2019t be here. Oh, I can\u2019t! I can\u2019t!\n\nMINERVA\u2014Perhaps, Ma, we older ones could make them some presents. I\ncould make a dandy nigger doll out of a bottle and a black stocking.\nSara Martin showed me how to do it.\n\nSAM\u2014-I\u2019ll go and get my tools right away and make a cradle for the doll.\n\nMINERVA\u2014And I\u2019ll give Jennie that ring that\u2019s got too small for me.\n\nSAM\u2014I\u2019ll paint my old sled over for Bobby and give Bill my hockey stick.\n\nPA\u2014That\u2019s the idea! You kids have got good heads on you.\n\nSAM\u2014Come on, Minerva, let\u2019s get busy.\n\n_Exit Minerva and Sam_\n\nMA\u2014The dear children! There\u2019s not a woman living has better children\nthan we have.\n\nPA (_blowing nose_)\u2014You\u2019re right there. I guess they take after their\nma.\n\nMA\u2014How you do talk! And to think that my own children have to teach\ntheir ma a lesson. Here am I moping away because I hadn\u2019t anything\nready when I should be hunting up and planning for them. What a silly\nold goose I\u2019m getting to be (_jumps up_). I\u2019ll\u2014\n\nPA\u2014Now, Ma, don\u2019t go and call yourself names. You\u2019re simply tired out\nworking yourself to death for these youngsters and\u2014\n\nMA\u2014There\u2019s that old Persian Lamb coat I got before I was married. I\u2019ll\nmake muffs and capes out of it for Jennie and Betty. It\u2019s moth-eaten in\nspots, but there\u2019s plenty good fur left and Minerva can help me make\nthem. And\u2014and\u2014for Minerva I\u2019ll (_rubs head_) oh, I know, I\u2019ll make\nMinerva a party dress out of my white silk wedding dress. I ain\u2019t never\nworn it much, and it\u2019s almost as good as new.\n\nPA\u2014Not your wedding dress! You ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to cut that up!\n\nMA\u2014Why ain\u2019t I? Laws-a-me, I can\u2019t wear it anymore. It wouldn\u2019t come\nwithin five inches of meeting round the waist, and it\u2019s too old\nfashioned for Minerva to wear the way it is.\n\nPA\u2014But your wedding dress, the dress you wore when we two was made\none, and you lookin\u2019 like an angel straight out of heaven in it. Oh, I\ncouldn\u2019t bear to see that cut up.\n\nMA\u2014Now, Pa, don\u2019t you go and talk nonsense. I didn\u2019t know you had that\nmuch sentiment in you. To tell the truth I hate to have it cut up\nmyself, but when it comes to making that dear child happy I\u2019d give her\nmy head on a charger if it would do her any good.\n\nPA\u2014Who\u2019s talkin\u2019 nonsense now? Well, since you\u2019ve got the girls fixed\nup I guess I\u2019ll have to think up something for the boys. Blest if I\nknow what I can give them (_scratches head_).\n\nMA\u2014It\u2019s awful hard planning for boys. They ain\u2019t so easy pleased as\ngirls with fixed over things. They\u2019re more for animals and such like.\n\nPA\u2014There you\u2019ve got it, Ma! I\u2019ll give Sam that little black colt\nall for his own. He\u2019s just crazy about it and Bill\u2014let\u2019s see\u2014what\ncan I give\u2014Oh yes, there\u2019s that Jersey heifer that\u2019s goin\u2019 to be a\nsure-enough winner some day\u2014I\u2019ll give him that. Then there\u2019s Bobby,\nwhat in the dickens can I give that tyke. He\u2019s too young\u2014\n\nMA (_at door_)\u2014Hush, I hear him coming.\n\n    _Bobby rushes in_\n\nBOBBY\u2014Oh, Ma, what do you think! I found a dozen eggs hid away in the\nhay-mow.\n\nMA\u2014Why Bobby, whatever are you doing with your Sunday trousers on?\n\nPA\u2014How\u2019d you happen to find the eggs?\n\nBOBBY\u2014I was jumpin\u2019 off the beam into the hay and I landed right on top\nof them. Didn\u2019t know they was there. Gee, there was some spill. I guess\nthem eggs was layed last summer, they smelt like it (_pause_). That\u2019s\nwhy I got my Sunday trousers on, Ma.\n\nMA\u2014Well, run along now and see that you don\u2019t get any more eggs for if\nyou spoil them trousers you go to bed. You ain\u2019t got any others.\n\nBOBBY\u2014All right, Ma. I only wished we had a swing in the barn like Pete\nMiller\u2019s. Yuh kin go clean to the roof in it. It beats jumpin\u2019 in the\nhay all holler (_runs out_).\n\nPA\u2014The very thing! I\u2019ll put a swing up in the barn for Bobby. I\u2019ll give\nhim a big bag of butternuts to crack to keep him out of the way \u2019till I\ngit it up.\n\nMA\u2014And I\u2019ll get Minerva to make taffy to put the nuts in (_exit Pa and\nMa_).\n\n    _Enter Minerva with bottle and stocking, Sam with chest of\n    tools and boards_\n\nMINERVA\u2014I\u2019m so glad I thought of this. It will be different from any\ndoll she\u2019s ever had (_puts stocking on bottle_). I\u2019ll sew on beads for\neyes with white paper pasted on for whites and red for a mouth and\u2014\n\nSAM (_sawing wood_)\u2014This will be some cradle when I get done, you bet\nyour life.\n\nMINERVA (_severely_)\u2014It\u2019s sure awful, the slang you use. You should cut\nit out.\n\nSAM (_jeeringly_)\u2014I should cut it out, eh! Cut it out isn\u2019t slang! Oh\nmy stars! (_turns handspring_). Say, Sis, don\u2019t you know that people\nin stone houses shouldn\u2019t throw glass?\n\nMINERVA\u2014No, I don\u2019t, and if I were you I wouldn\u2019t start quoting until I\ncould get it right.\n\nBOBBY (_outside_)\u2014I did hear Santa\u2019s reindeer. I know I did.\n\nMINERVA (_jumping up_)\u2014Here\u2019s the twins. Hide your stuff quick\n(_scramble_).\n\n    _Enter Bobby and Betty_\n\n_Betty has black sticking-plaster over front teeth to hide them._\n\nBETTY\u2014Aw, you didn\u2019t (_runs to Minerva_). Thanta only cometh at night,\ndon\u2019t ee, Nerva?\n\nMINERVA (_lifting her on her knee_)\u2014Yes, dear, when you\u2019re fast asleep\nin\u2014\n\nBOBBY\u2014But I did hear him, I heard the bells jingle in the roof.\n\nMINERVA\u2014Perhaps he\u2019s around seeing if you\u2019re good children and don\u2019t\nquarrel. You know he doesn\u2019t give presents to bad children.\n\nBETTY\u2014Uths hathn\u2019t fighted for two days. Uths been awful good, hathn\u2019t\nuth, Bobby?\n\nBOBBY\u2014Yep, but if Christmas doesn\u2019t hurry up and come I\u2019ll bust, I know\nI will.\n\n    _Enter Bill and Jennie_\n\nBILL\u2014Sam, what do you know, Pa says we can\u2019t get into town. How are we\ngoing to buy\u2014\n\nSAM (_shakes hand in warning behind twin\u2019s backs_)\u2014See here Bill, I\u2014I\u2014\n\nBILL\u2014Say, what\u2019s the matter with you, Sam? Have you got the palsy?\n\nSAM (_pulling him to front_)\u2014No, but I wish you had. Ain\u2019t you got any\nsense? Do you want the kids to quit believin\u2019 in Santa?\n\nBILL\u2014No, but how\u2014\n\nJENNIE (_to Minerva_)\u2014Ain\u2019t we goin\u2019 to get any Christmas presents,\nNervy?\n\nMINERVA\u2014Of course we are, dear.\n\nJENNIE\u2014But where are we going to get them?\n\nBETTY\u2014From Thanta, of courth. Where elth could you get them?\n\nMINERVA\u2014Of course. He\u2019s never failed us yet and I guess he isn\u2019t going\nto this Christmas either. Twinnies, have you all the pop-corn strings\nmade for the tree?\n\nBOBBY\u2014No, let\u2019s go to the kitchen and finish them, Betty (_exit twins_).\n\nJENNY\u2014But Nervy, where are we goin\u2019 to git them?\n\nBILL\u2014Yes, where? Pa and Ma never got to town and\u2014\n\nMINERVA\u2014By making them for each other.\n\nBILL and JENNIE\u2014By making them!\n\nSAM\u2014Yes, why not? (_gets tools, etc._). Sis and I are making our\npresents.\n\nBILL\u2014What are you makin\u2019?\n\nSAM\u2014Wouldn\u2019t you like to know, now?\n\nJENNIE\u2014But, Nervy, made things won\u2019t be real Christmas presents\n(_cries_). And I wanted a book, and a pencil box and a ring and\u2014and\u2014a\nmuff and\u2014and\u2014\n\nMINERVA (_fiercely_)\u2014Now see here, Jennie. You stop crying this\nminute, Ma\u2019s feeling dreadful bad as it is because she can\u2019t give us a\nreal-to-goodness Christmas without store presents\u2014\n\nBILL (_shaking her_)\u2014Aw, shut up, Jennie. I guess one Christmas\nwithout regular presents won\u2019t kill us. And there will be heaps of fun\nmakin\u2019 them and keepin\u2019 secrets and things. I bet I kin make Bobby the\ndandiest top you ever saw.\n\nJENNIE (_brightening_)\u2014And I\u2019ll make a picture book for Betty.\n\nMINERVA\u2014You\u2019re talking now. They\u2019ll be tickled to pieces with them.\n\nMA (_outside_)\u2014Minerva, where are you?\n\nPA (_outside_)\u2014Sam, come here a minute.\n\nMINERVA\u2014There\u2019s Ma calling me! (_exit_).\n\nSAM\u2014There\u2019s Pa calling me!

I\u2019m going to make a bag for Nervy to carry her crochet in\nand put featherstitching on it with the purple sil\u2014silk\u2014silklene I\u2019ve\ngot.\n\nBILL\u2014Aw shucks, you haven\u2019t time.\n\nJENNIE\u2014I have, too, it just takes a few minutes. Boys don\u2019t know\nnothin\u2019 about sewin\u2019.\n\nBILL\u2014Aw, sewin\u2019. Hockey beats that all to pieces. What kin I give\nSam? (_picks up magazine_). Oh, I know, I\u2019ll cut up the ads in\nour old magazine and glue them on pasteboard. They\u2019ll make swell\npicture-puzzles.\n\nJENNIE\u2014Oh goody! I just love picture-puzzles.\n\nBILL\u2014I ain\u2019t makin\u2019 them for you, they\u2019re for Sam, I told you.\n\nJENNIE\u2014Well, he\u2019ll let me play with them. He ain\u2019t stingy like some\npeople I know.\n\nBILL\u2014Hush, here\u2019s Sam now.\n\n    _Enter Sam and Minerva_\n\nMINERVA\u2014Sam and I have thought of presents for everybody but Ma and Pa.\nWhat can we give them, I wonder.\n\nSAM\u2014Have you kids anything for them?\n\nBILL and JENNIE\u2014No.\n\nJENNIE\u2014What can we give them?\n\nMINERVA\u2014I don\u2019t know. There isn\u2019t time to make much and I\u2019ve promised\nto help her make the f\u2014 (_puts hand on mouth_).\n\nJENNIE\u2014Make what?\n\nMINERVA\u2014Make some taffy. Bobby\u2019s cracking nuts for it.\n\nBILL (_turning somersault_)\u2014Oh, I\u2019ve got an idea.\n\nALL\u2014What is it?\n\nBILL\u2014I know what\u2019ll please them more\u2019n anything.\n\nJENNIE\u2014For goodness sake, Bill, get up and tell us. Don\u2019t keep us in\nsuspenders.\n\nBILL\u2014Well, I read a story once where a lot of kids instead of givin\u2019\ntheir pa and ma presents, wrote notes promisin\u2019 to do the chores and\nthings they hated most for a whole year without bein\u2019 told and\u2014\n\nMINERVA\u2014Oh, that\u2019s a splendid idea!\n\nSAM\u2014It is if we can stick to it.\n\nJENNIE\u2014I don\u2019t believe none of us could\u2014not for a whole year.\n\nMINERVA\u2014We can if we love them enough to really try. Will you do it?\n\nSAM\u2014All right, I\u2019m game.\n\nBILL\u2014So am I.\n\nJENNIE\u2014I\u2019ll\u2014has it got to be what you hate the very worst?\n\nBILL\u2014Of course, it ain\u2019t no good to promise something easy. Anyone\ncould do that.\n\nMINERVA\u2014And it will show whether you love them enough to sac-to\nsacer-sacerfice ourselves for them.\n\nJENNIE\u2014I, guess I can do it. Anyway I\u2019ll try awful hard.\n\nMINERVA\u2014I know you will, Jennie. I\u2019ll go and call the twins.\n\nSAM\u2014Do you think we had better let them in on it.\n\nMINERVA\u2014Why, of course, Pa and Ma would be so pleased.\n\nBILL\u2014That settles it. (_calls_) Bobby! Betty! Jennie, hunt up some\npaper and pencils.\n\n    _Enter Twins_\n\nTWINS\u2014What do you want?\n\nJENNIE\u2014We\u2019re talking about the Christmas present we\u2019re going to give Ma\nand Pa and\u2014\n\nBETTY\u2014Why, ithn\u2019t Thanta goin\u2019 to give them any prethents?\n\nMINERVA\u2014No, dear, Santa just brings presents to children. Would you\nlike to do something that will please Pa and Ma very much?\n\nBETTY\u2014Yeth, tell uth what it ith.\n\nMINERVA\u2014We are all going to promise to do something we hate doing for a\nwhole year without being told.\n\nBOBBY\u2014That ain\u2019t no present.\n\nSAM\u2014Oh, yes, it is the very best kind.\n\nBOBBY\u2014But you can\u2019t put a pwomise on a Christmas tree.\n\nBILL\u2014We put notes on instead. Will you do it?\n\nBOBBY\u2014I guess so. I like doin\u2019 everything I have to, so it won\u2019t be\nhard for me to pwomise.\n\nJENNIE\u2014Oh, you little lilac. What a fib.\n\nBOBBY\u2014It ain\u2019t then.\n\nJENNIE\u2014It is too. I could tell you half a dozen things you make a fuss\nabout. Here\u2019s paper and pencils (_distributes them_).\n\nMINERVA\u2014Now let\u2019s get around the table and write our notes. I\u2019ll write\nyours for you Betty.\n\nBETTY\u2014No. I\u2019ll wite it mythelf.\n\nJENNIE\u2014You can\u2019t write nothin\u2019 anyone could read.\n\nBETTY\u2014I can print then, ith\u2019s eathier to read.\n\nBOBBY\u2014So can I. You can spell the hard words for me, Sam.\n\nMINERVA\u2014You didn\u2019t give me a pencil, Jennie.\n\nJENNIE\u2014There wasn\u2019t enough to go around. Bill, see if you have one in\nyour pocket.\n\nBILL\u2014All right (_empties pocket full of truck, brings out dead mouse\nand pencil at last. Girls scream. Minerva jumps on chair_).\n\nMINERVA\u2014Oh Bill, you nasty boy.\n\nBILL (_laughs_)\u2014Girls are the beatenest. Afraid of a dead mouse!

We haven\u2019t any time to waste.\n\nMINERVA\u2014I don\u2019t know which I hate doing worse, washing dishes or\ndusting (_bites pencil_).\n\nJENNIE\u2014I wouldn\u2019t bite that pencil if I was you. It\u2019s been rubbin\u2019 up\nagainst that dead mouse.\n\nMINERVA (_slipping it down_)\u2014Ugh! I\u2019ll not touch it. I\u2019ll use yours\nwhen you\u2019re through.\n\nBOBBY\u2014I wish you\u2019d keep quiet so that I could think up something to\npwomise.

There\u2019ll be\nmore fun reading the notes tomorrow.\n\nBETTY\u2014Notes don\u2019t make much thow on a Chwismas tree.\n\nJENNIE (_claps hands_)\u2014I\u2019ve got it! I\u2019ve got it!
