    "body": "\n\nDIRTY WORK\n\nIt was nearly high-water, and the night-watchman, who had stepped aboard\na lighter lying alongside the wharf to smoke a pipe, sat with half-closed\neyes enjoying the summer evening.  The bustle of the day was over, the\nwharves were deserted, and hardly a craft moved on the river.  Perfumed\nclouds of shag, hovering for a time over the lighter, floated lazily\ntowards the Surrey shore.\n\n\"There's one thing about my job,\" said the night-watchman, slowly, \"it's\ndone all alone by yourself.  There's no foreman a-hollering at you and\noffering you a penny for your thoughts, and no mates to run into you from\nbehind with a loaded truck and then ask you why you didn't look where\nyou're going to.  From six o'clock in the evening to six o'clock next\nmorning I'm my own master.\"\n\nHe rammed down the tobacco with an experienced forefinger and puffed\ncontentedly.\n\nPeople like you 'ud find it lonely (he continued, after a pause); I did\nat fust.  I used to let people come and sit 'ere with me of an evening\ntalking, but I got tired of it arter a time, and when one chap fell\noverboard while 'e was showing me 'ow he put his wife's mother in 'er\nplace, I gave it up altogether.  There was three foot o' mud in the dock\nat the time, and arter I 'ad got 'im out, he fainted in my arms.\n\nArter that I kept myself to myself.  Say wot you like, a man's best\nfriend is 'imself.  There's nobody else'll do as much for 'im, or let 'im\noff easier when he makes a mistake.  If I felt a bit lonely I used to\nopen the wicket in the gate and sit there watching the road, and p'r'aps\npass a word or two with the policeman.  Then something 'appened one night\nthat made me take quite a dislike to it for a time.\n\nI was sitting there with my feet outside, smoking a quiet pipe, when I\n'eard a bit of a noise in the distance.  Then I 'eard people running and\nshouts of \"Stop, thief!\"  A man came along round the corner full pelt,\nand, just as I got up, dashed through the wicket and ran on to the wharf.\nI was arter 'im like a shot and got up to 'im just in time to see him\nthrow something into the dock.  And at the same moment I 'eard the other\npeople run past the gate.\n\n\"Wot's up?\" I ses, collaring 'im.\n\n\"Nothing,\" he ses, breathing 'ard and struggling.  \"Let me go.\"\n\nHe was a little wisp of a man, and I shook 'im like a dog shakes a rat.\nI remembered my own pocket being picked, and I nearly shook the breath\nout of 'im.\n\n\"And now I'm going to give you in charge,\" I ses, pushing 'im along\ntowards the gate.\n\n\"Wot for?\" he ses, purtending to be surprised.\n\n\"Stealing,\" I ses.\n\n\"You've made a mistake,\" he ses; \"you can search me if you like.\"\n\n\"More use to search the dock,\" I ses.  \"I see you throw it in.  Now you\nkeep quiet, else you'll get 'urt.  If you get five years I shall be all\nthe more pleased.\"\n\nI don't know 'ow he did it, but 'e did.  He seemed to sink away between\nmy legs, and afore I knew wot was 'appening, I was standing upside down\nwith all the blood rushing to my 'ead.  As I rolled over he bolted\nthrough the wicket, and was off like a flash of lightning.\n\nA couple o' minutes arterwards the people wot I 'ad 'eard run past came\nback agin.  There was a big fat policeman with 'em--a man I'd seen afore\non the beat--and, when they 'ad gorn on, he stopped to 'ave a word with\nme.\n\n\"'Ot work,\" he ses, taking off his 'elmet and wiping his bald 'ead with a\nlarge red handkerchief.  \"I've lost all my puff.\"\n\n\"Been running?\"  I ses, very perlite.\n\n\"Arter a pickpocket,\" he ses.  \"He snatched a lady's purse just as she\nwas stepping aboard the French boat with her 'usband.  'Twelve pounds in\nit in gold, two peppermint lozenges, and a postage stamp.'\"\n\nHe shook his 'ead, and put his 'elmet on agin.\n\n\"Holding it in her little 'and as usual,\" he ses.  \"Asking for trouble, I\ncall it.  I believe if a woman 'ad one hand off and only a finger and\nthumb left on the other, she'd carry 'er purse in it.\"\n\nHe knew a'most as much about wimmen as I do.  When 'is fust wife died,\nshe said 'er only wish was that she could take 'im with her, and she made\n'im promise her faithful that 'e'd never marry agin.  His second wife,\narter a long illness, passed away while he was playing hymns on the\nconcertina to her, and 'er mother, arter looking at 'er very hard, went\nto the doctor and said she wanted an inquest.\n\nHe went on talking for a long time, but I was busy doing a bit of 'ead-\nwork and didn't pay much attention to 'im.  I was thinking o' twelve\npounds, two lozenges, and a postage stamp laying in the mud at the bottom\nof my dock, and arter a time 'e said 'e see as 'ow I was waiting to get\nback to my night's rest, and went off--stamping.\n\nI locked the wicket when he 'ad gorn away, and then I went to the edge of\nthe dock and stood looking down at the spot where the purse 'ad been\nchucked in.  The tide was on the ebb, but there was still a foot or two\nof water atop of the mud.  I walked up and down, thinking.\n\nI thought for a long time, and then I made up my mind.  If I got the\npurse and took it to the police-station, the police would share the money\nout between 'em, and tell me they 'ad given it back to the lady.  If I\nfound it and put a notice in the newspaper--which would cost money--very\nlikely a dozen or two ladies would come and see me and say it was theirs.\nThen if I gave it to the best-looking one and the one it belonged to\nturned up, there'd be trouble.  My idea was to keep it--for a time--and\nthen if the lady who lost it came to me and asked me for it I would give\nit to 'er.\n\nOnce I had made up my mind to do wot was right I felt quite 'appy, and\narter a look up and down, I stepped round to the Bear's Head and 'ad a\ncouple o' goes o' rum to keep the cold out.  There was nobody in there\nbut the landlord, and 'e started at once talking about the thief, and 'ow\nhe 'ad run arter him in 'is shirt-sleeves.\n\n\"My opinion is,\" he ses, \"that 'e bolted on one of the wharves and 'id\n'imself.  He disappeared like magic.  Was that little gate o' yours\nopen?\"\n\n\"I was on the wharf,\" I ses, very cold.\n\n\"You might ha' been on the wharf and yet not 'ave seen anybody come on,\"\nhe ses, nodding.\n\n\"Wot d'ye mean?\" I ses, very sharp.  \"Nothing,\" he ses.  \"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Are you trying to take my character away?\"  I ses, fixing 'im with my\neye.\n\n\"Lo' bless me, no!\" he ses, staring at me.  \"It's no good to me.\"\n\nHe sat down in 'is chair behind the bar and went straight off to sleep\nwith his eyes screwed up as tight as they would go.  Then 'e opened\nhis mouth and snored till the glasses shook.  I suppose I've been one of\nthe best customers he ever 'ad, and that's the way he treated me.  For\ntwo pins I'd ha' knocked 'is ugly 'ead off, but arter waking him up very\nsudden by dropping my glass on the floor I went off back to the wharf.\n\nI locked up agin, and 'ad another look at the dock.  The water 'ad nearly\ngone and the mud was showing in patches.  My mind went back to a\nsailorman wot had dropped 'is watch over-board two years before, and\nfound it by walking about in the dock in 'is bare feet.  He found it more\neasy because the glass broke when he trod on it.\n\nThe evening was a trifle chilly for June, but I've been used to roughing\nit all my life, especially when I was afloat, and I went into the office\nand began to take my clothes off.  I took off everything but my pants,\nand I made sure o' them by making braces for 'em out of a bit of string.\nThen I turned the gas low, and, arter slipping on my boots, went outside.\n\nIt was so cold that at fust I thought I'd give up the idea.  The longer I\nstood on the edge looking at the mud the colder it looked, but at last I\nturned round and went slowly down the ladder.  I waited a moment at the\nbottom, and was just going to step off when I remembered that I 'ad got\nmy boots on, and I 'ad to go up agin and take 'em off.\n\nI went down very slow the next time, and anybody who 'as been down an\niron ladder with thin, cold rungs, in their bare feet, will know why,\nand I had just dipped my left foot in, when the wharf-bell rang.\n\nI 'oped at fust that it was a runaway-ring, but it kept on, and the\nlonger it kept on, the worse it got.  I went up that ladder agin and\ncalled out that I was coming, and then I went into the office and just\nslipped on my coat and trousers and went to the gate.\n\n\"Wot d'you want?\" I ses, opening the wicket three or four inches and\nlooking out at a man wot was standing there.\n\n\"Are you old Bill?\"  he ses.\n\n\"I'm the watchman,\" I ses, sharp-like.  \"Wot d'you want?\"\n\n\"Don't bite me!\" he ses, purtending to draw back.  \"I ain't done no 'arm.\nI've come round about that glass you smashed at the Bear's Head.\"\n\n\"Glass!\" I ses, 'ardly able to speak.\n\n\"Yes, glass,\" he ses--\"thing wot yer drink out of.  The landlord says\nit'll cost you a tanner, and 'e wants it now in case you pass away in\nyour sleep.  He couldn't come 'imself cos he's got nobody to mind the\nbar, so 'e sent me.  Why!  Halloa!  Where's your boots?  Ain't you afraid\no' ketching cold?\"\n\n\"You clear off,\" I ses, shouting at him.  \"D'ye 'ear me?  Clear off while\nyou're safe, and you tell the landlord that next time 'e insults me I'll\nsmash every glass in 'is place and then sit 'im on top of 'cm!  Tell 'im\nif 'e wants a tanner out o' me, to come round 'imself, and see wot he\ngets.\"\n\nIt was a silly thing to say, and I saw it arterwards, but I was in such a\ntemper I 'ardly knew wot I was saying.  I slammed the wicket in 'is face\nand turned the key and then I took off my clothes and went down that\nladder agin.\n\nIt seemed colder than ever, and the mud when I got fairly into it was\nworse than I thought it could ha' been.  It stuck to me like glue, and\nevery step I took seemed colder than the one before.  'Owever, when I\nmake up my mind to do a thing, I do it.  I fixed my eyes on the place\nwhere I thought the purse was, and every time I felt anything under my\nfoot I reached down and picked it up--and then chucked it away as far as\nI could so as not to pick it up agin.  Dirty job it was, too, and in five\nminutes I was mud up to the neck, a'most.  And I 'ad just got to wot I\nthought was the right place, and feeling about very careful, when the\nbell rang agin.\n\nI thought I should ha' gorn out o' my mind.  It was just a little tinkle\nat first, then another tinkle, but, as I stood there all in the dark and\ncold trying to make up my mind to take no notice of it, it began to ring\nlike mad.  I 'ad to go--I've known men climb over the gate afore now--and\nI didn't want to be caught in that dock.\n\nThe mud seemed stickier than ever, but I got out at last, and, arter\nscraping some of it off with a bit o' stick, I put on my coat and\ntrousers and boots just as I was and went to the gate, with the bell\ngoing its 'ardest all the time.\n\nWhen I opened the gate and see the landlord of the Bear's Head standing\nthere I turned quite dizzy, and there was a noise in my ears like the\nroaring of the sea.  I should think I stood there for a couple o' minutes\nwithout being able to say a word.  I could think of 'em.\n\n\"Don't be frightened, Bill,\" ses the landlord.  \"I'm not going to eat\nyou.\"\n\n\"He looks as if he's walking in 'is sleep,\" ses the fat policeman, wot\nwas standing near by.  \"Don't startle 'im.\"\n\n\"He always looks like that,\" ses the landlord.\n\nI stood looking at 'im.  I could speak then, but I couldn't think of any\nwords good enough; not with a policeman standing by with a notebook in\n'is pocket.\n\n\"Wot was you ringing my bell for?\" I ses, at last.\n\n\"Why didn't you answer it before?\" ses the landlord.  \"D'you think I've\ngot nothing better to do than to stand ringing your bell for three-\nquarters of an hour?  Some people would report you.\"\n\n\"I know my dooty,\" I ses; \"there's no craft up to-night, and no reason\nfor anybody to come to my bell. If I was to open the gate every time a\nparcel of overgrown boys rang my bell I should 'ave enough to do.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll overlook it this time, seeing as you're an old man and\ncouldn't get another sleeping-in job,\" he ses, looking at the policeman\nfor him to see 'ow clever 'e was.  \"Wot about that tanner?  That's wot\nI've come for.\"\n\n\"You be off,\" I ses, starting to shut the wicket.  \"You won't get no\ntanner out of me.\"\n\n\"All right,\" he ses, \"I shall stand here and go on ringing the bell till\nyou pay up, that's all.\"\n\nHe gave it another tug, and the policeman instead of locking 'im up for\nit stood there laughing.\n\nI gave 'im the tanner.  It was no use standing there arguing over a\ntanner, with a purse of twelve quid waiting for me in the dock, but I\ntold 'im wot people thought of 'im.\n\n\"Arf a second, watchman,\" ses the policeman, as I started to shut the\nwicket agin.  \"You didn't see anything of that pickpocket, did you?\"\n\n\"I did not,\" I ses.\n\n\"'Cos this gentleman thought he might 'ave come in here,\" ses the\npoliceman.\n\n\"'Ow could he 'ave come in here without me knowing it?\"  I ses, firing\nup.\n\n\"Easy,\" ses the landlord, \"and stole your boots into the bargain\"\n\n\"He might 'ave come when your back was turned,\" ses the policeman, \"and\nif so, he might be 'iding there now.  I wonder whether you'd mind me\nhaving a look round?\"\n\n\"I tell you he ain't 'ere,\" I ses, very short, \"but, to ease your mind,\nI'll 'ave a look round myself arter you've gorn.\"\n\nThe policeman shook his 'ead.  \"Well, o' course, I can't come in without\nyour permission,\" he ses, with a little cough, \"but I 'ave an idea, that\nif it was your guv'nor 'ere instead of you he'd ha' been on'y too pleased\nto do anything 'e could to help the law.  I'll beg his pardon tomorrow\nfor asking you, in case he might object.\"\n\nThat settled it.  That's the police all over, and that's 'ow they get\ntheir way and do as they like.  I could see 'im in my mind's eye talking\nto the guv'nor, and letting out little things about broken glasses and\nsuch-like by accident.  I drew back to let 'im pass, and I was so upset\nthat when that little rat of a landlord follered 'im I didn't say a word.\n\nI stood and watched them poking and prying about the wharf as if it\nbelonged to 'em, with the light from the policeman's lantern flashing\nabout all over the place.  I was shivering with cold and temper.  The mud\nwas drying on me.\n\n\"If you've finished 'unting for the pickpocket I'll let you out and get\non with my work,\" I ses, drawing myself up.\n\n\"Good night,\" ses the policeman, moving off.  \"Good night, dear,\" ses the\nlandlord.  \"Mind you tuck yourself up warm.\"\n\nI lost my temper for the moment and afore I knew wot I was doing I 'ad\ngot hold of him and was shoving 'im towards the gate as 'ard as I could\nshove.  He pretty near got my coat off in the struggle, and next moment\nthe police-man 'ad turned his lantern on me and they was both staring at\nme as if they couldn't believe their eyesight.\n\n\"He--he's turning black!\" ses the landlord.\n\n\"He's turned black!\" ses the policeman.\n\nThey both stood there looking at me with their mouths open, and then\nafore I knew wot he was up to, the policeman came close up to me and\nscratched my chest with his finger-nail.\n\n\"It's mud!\" he ses.\n\n\"You keep your nails to yourself,\" I ses.  \"It's nothing to do with you.\"\nand I couldn't 'elp noticing the smell of it.  Nobody could.  And wot was\nworse than all was, that the tide 'ad turned and was creeping over the\nmud in the dock.\n\nThey got tired of it at last and came back to where I was and stood there\nshaking their 'eads at me.\n\n\"If he was on the wharf 'e must 'ave made his escape while you was in the\nBear's Head,\" ses the policeman.\n\n\"He was in my place a long time,\" ses the landlord.\n\n\"Well, it's no use crying over spilt milk,\" ses the policeman.  \"Funny\nsmell about 'ere, ain't there?\"  he ses, sniffing, and turning to the\nlandlord.  \"Wot is it?\"\n\n\"I dunno,\" ses the landlord.  \"I noticed it while we was talking to 'im\nat the gate.  It seems to foller 'im about.\"\n\n\"I've smelt things I like better,\" ses the policeman, sniffing agin.\n\"It's just like the foreshore when somebody 'as been stirring the mud up\na bit.\"\n\n\"Unless it's a case of 'tempted suicide,\" he ses, looking at me very\n'ard.\n\n\"Ah!\" ses the landlord.\n\n\"There's no mud on 'is clothes,\" ses the policeman, looking me over with\nhis lantern agin.\n\n\"He must 'ave gone in naked, but I should like to see 'is legs to make--\nAll right!  All right!  Keep your 'air on.\"\n\n\"You look arter your own legs, then,\" I ses, very sharp, \"and mind your\nown business.\"\n\n\"It is my business,\" he ses, turning to the landlord.  \"Was 'e strange in\nhis manner at all when 'e was in your place to-night?\"\n\n\"He smashed one o' my best glasses,\" ses the landlord.\n\n\"So he did,\" ses the policeman.  \"So he did.  I'd forgot that.  Do you\nknow 'im well?\"\n\n\"Not more than I can 'elp,\" ses the landlord.  \"He's been in my place a\ngood bit, but I never knew of any reason why 'e should try and do away\nwith 'imself.  If he's been disappointed in love, he ain't told me\nanything about it.\"\n\nI suppose that couple o' fools 'ud 'ave stood there talking about me all\nnight if I'd ha' let 'em, but I had about enough of it.\n\n\"Look 'ere,\" I ses, \"you're very clever, both of you, but you needn't\nworry your 'eads about me.  I've just been having a mud-bath, that's\nall.\"\n\n\"A mud-bath!\"  ses both of 'em, squeaking like a couple o' silly parrots.\n\n\"For rheumatics,\" I ses.  \"I 'ad it some-thing cruel to-night, and I\nthought that p'r'aps the mud 'ud do it good.  I read about it in the\npapers.  There's places where you pay pounds and pounds for 'em, but,\nbeing a pore man, I 'ad to 'ave mine on the cheap.\"\n\nThe policeman stood there looking at me for a moment, and then 'e began\nto laugh till he couldn't stop 'imself.\n\n\"Love-a-duck!\" he ses, at last, wiping his eyes.  \"I wish I'd seen it.\"\n\n\"Must ha' looked like a fat mermaid,\" ses the landlord, wagging his silly\n'ead at me.  \"I can just see old Bill sitting in the mud a-combing his\n'air and singing.\"\n\nThey 'ad some more talk o' that sort, just to show each other 'ow funny\nthey was, but they went off at last, and I fastened up the gate and went\ninto the office to clean myself up as well as I could.  One comfort was\nthey 'adn't got the least idea of wot I was arter, and I 'ad a fancy that\nthe one as laughed last would be the one as got that twelve quid.\n\nI was so tired that I slept nearly all day arter I 'ad got 'ome, and I\n'ad no sooner got back to the wharf in the evening than I see that the\nlandlord 'ad been busy.  If there was one silly fool that asked me the\nbest way of making mud-pies, I should think there was fifty.  Little\nthings please little minds, and the silly way some of 'em went on made me\nfeel sorry for my sects.\n\nBy eight o'clock, 'owever, they 'ad all sheered off, and I got a broom\nand began to sweep up to 'elp pass the time away until low-water.  On'y\none craft 'ad come up that day--a ketch called the Peewit--and as she was\nberthed at the end of the jetty she wasn't in my way at all.\n\nHer skipper came on to the wharf just afore ten.  Fat, silly old man 'e\nwas, named Fogg.  Always talking about 'is 'ealth and taking medicine to\ndo it good.  He came up to me slow like, and, when 'e stopped and asked\nme about the rheumatics, the broom shook in my 'and.\n\n\"Look here,\" I ses, \"if you want to be funny, go and be funny with them\nas likes it.  I'm fair sick of it, so I give you warning.\"\n\n\"Funny?\" he ses, staring at me with eyes like a cow.  \"Wot d'ye mean?\nThere's nothing funny about rheumatics; I ought to know; I'm a martyr to\nit.  Did you find as 'ow the mud did you any good?\"\n\nI looked at 'im hard, but 'e stood there looking at me with his fat baby-\nface, and I knew he didn't mean any harm; so I answered 'im perlite and\nwished 'im good night.\n\n\"I've 'ad pretty near everything a man can have,\" he ses, casting anchor\non a empty box, \"but I think the rheumatics was about the worst of 'em\nall.  I even tried bees for it once.\"\n\n\"Bees!\"  I ses.  \"_Bees!_\"\n\n\"Bee-stings,\" he ses.  \"A man told me that if I could on'y persuade a few\nbees to sting me, that 'ud cure me.  I don't know what 'e meant by\npersuading! they didn't want no persuading.  I took off my coat and shirt\nand went and rocked one of my neighbour's bee-hives next door, and I\nthought my last hour 'ad come.\"\n\nHe sat on that box and shivered at the memory of it.\n\n\"Now I take Dr. Pepper's pellets instead,\" he ses.  \"I've got a box in my\nstate-room, and if you'd like to try 'em you're welcome.\"\n\nHe sat there talking about the complaints he had 'ad and wot he 'ad done\nfor them till I thought I should never have got rid of 'im.  He got up at\nlast, though, and, arter telling me to always wear flannel next to my\nskin, climbed aboard and went below.\n\nI knew the hands was aboard, and arter watching 'is cabin-skylight until\nthe light was out, I went and undressed.  Then I crept back on to the\njetty, and arter listening by the Peewit to make sure that they was all\nasleep, I went back and climbed down the ladder.\n\nIt was colder than ever.  The cold seemed to get into my bones, but I\nmade up my mind to 'ave that twelve quid if I died for it.  I trod round\nand round the place where I 'ad seen that purse chucked in until I was\ntired, and the rubbish I picked up by mistake you wouldn't believe.\n\nI suppose I 'ad been in there arf an hour, and I was standing up with my\nteeth clenched to keep them from chattering, when I 'appened to look\nround and see something like a white ball coming down the ladder.  My\n'art seemed to stand still for a moment, and then it began to beat as\nthough it would burst.  The white thing came down lower and lower, and\nthen all of a sudden it stood in the mud and said, \"Ow!\"\n\n\"Who is it?\" I ses.  \"Who are you?\"  \"Halloa, Bill!\" it ses.  \"Ain't it\nperishing cold?\"\n\nIt was the voice o' Cap'n Fogg, and if ever I wanted to kill a fellow-\ncreetur, I wanted to then.\n\n\"'Ave you been in long, Bill?\" he ses.  \"About ten minutes,\" I ses,\ngrinding my teeth.\n\n\"Is it doing you good?\" he ses.\n\nI didn't answer 'im.\n\n\"I was just going off to sleep,\" he ses, \"when I felt a sort of hot pain\nin my left knee.  O' course, I knew what it meant at once, and instead o'\ntaking some of the pellets I thought I'd try your remedy instead.  It's a\nbit nippy, but I don't mind that if it does me good.\"\n\nHe laughed a silly sort o' laugh, and then I'm blest if 'e didn't sit\ndown in that mud and waller in it.  Then he'd get up and come for'ard two\nor three steps and sit down agin.\n\n\"Ain't you sitting down, Bill?\" he ses, arter a time.\n\n\"No,\" I ses, \"I'm not.\"\n\n\"I don't think you can expect to get the full benefit unless you do,\" he\nses, coming up close to me and sitting down agin.  \"It's a bit of a shock\nat fust, but  Halloa!\"\n\n\"Wot's up?\" I ses.\n\n\"Sitting on something hard,\" he ses.  \"I wish people 'ud be more\ncareful.\"\n\nHe took a list to port and felt under the star-board side.  Then he\nbrought his 'and up and tried to wipe the mud off and see wot he 'ad got.\n\n\"Wot is it?\"  I ses, with a nasty sinking sort o' feeling inside me.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he ses, going on wiping.  \"It's soft outside and 'ard\ninside.  It----\"\n\n\"Let's 'ave a look at it,\" I ses, holding out my 'and.\n\n\"It's nothing,\" he ses, in a queer voice, getting up and steering for the\nladder.  \"Bit of oyster-shell, I think.\"\n\nHe was up that ladder hand over fist, with me close behind 'im, and as\nsoon as he 'ad got on to the wharf started to run to 'is ship.\n\n\"Good night, Bill,\" he ses, over 'is shoulder.\n\n\"Arf a moment.\"  I ses, follering 'im.\n\n\"I must get aboard,\" he ses; \"I believe I've got a chill,\" and afore I\ncould stop 'im he 'ad jumped on and run down to 'is cabin.\n\nI stood on the jetty for a minute or two, trembling all over with cold\nand temper.  Then I saw he 'ad got a light in 'is cabin, and I crept\naboard and peeped down the skylight.  And I just 'ad time to see some\nsovereigns on the table, when he looked up and blew out the light.",
