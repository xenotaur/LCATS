    "body": "\nTHE PERSECUTION OF BOB PRETTY\n\nThe old man sat on his accustomed bench outside the Cauliflower.  A\ngenerous measure of beer stood in a blue and white jug by his elbow, and\nlittle wisps of smoke curled slowly upward from the bowl of his\nchurchwarden pipe.  The knapsacks of two young men lay where they were\nflung on the table, and the owners, taking a noon-tide rest, turned a\npolite, if bored, ear to the reminiscences of grateful old age.\n\nPoaching, said the old man, who had tried topics ranging from early\nturnips to horseshoeing--poaching ain't wot it used to be in these 'ere\nparts.  Nothing is like it used to be, poaching nor anything else; but\nthat there man you might ha' noticed as went out about ten minutes ago\nand called me \"Old Truthfulness\" as 'e passed is the worst one I know.\nBob Pretty 'is name is, and of all the sly, artful, deceiving men that\never lived in Claybury 'e is the worst--never did a honest day's work in\n'is life and never wanted the price of a glass of ale.\n\nBob Pretty's worst time was just after old Squire Brown died.  The old\nsquire couldn't afford to preserve much, but by-and-by a gentleman with\nplenty o' money, from London, named Rockett, took 'is place and things\nbegan to look up.  Pheasants was 'is favourites, and 'e spent no end o'\nmoney rearing of 'em, but anything that could be shot at suited 'im, too.\n\nHe started by sneering at the little game that Squire Brown 'ad left, but\nall 'e could do didn't seem to make much difference; things disappeared\nin a most eggstrordinary way, and the keepers went pretty near crazy,\nwhile the things the squire said about Claybury and Claybury men was\ndisgraceful.\n\nEverybody knew as it was Bob Pretty and one or two of 'is mates from\nother places, but they couldn't prove it.  They couldn't catch 'im nohow,\nand at last the squire 'ad two keepers set off to watch 'im by night and\nby day.\n\nBob Pretty wouldn't believe it; he said 'e couldn't.  And even when it\nwas pointed out to 'im that Keeper Lewis was follering of 'im he said\nthat it just 'appened he was going the same way, that was all.  And\nsometimes 'e'd get up in the middle of the night and go for a fifteen-\nmile walk 'cos 'e'd got the toothache, and Mr. Lewis, who 'adn't got it,\nhad to tag along arter 'im till he was fit to drop.  O' course, it was\none keeper the less to look arter the game, and by-and-by the squire see\nthat and took 'im off.\n\nAll the same they kept a pretty close watch on Bob, and at last one\narternoon they sprang out on 'im as he was walking past Gray's farm, and\nasked him wot it was he 'ad in his pockets.\n\n\"That's my bisness, Mr. Lewis,\" ses Bob Pretty.\n\nMr. Smith, the other keeper, passed 'is hands over Bob's coat and felt\nsomething soft and bulgy.\n\n\"You take your 'ands off of me,\" ses Bob; \"you don't know 'ow partikler I\nam.\"\n\nHe jerked 'imself away, but they caught 'old of 'im agin, and Mr. Lewis\nput 'is hand in his inside pocket and pulled out two brace o' partridges.\n\n\"You'll come along of us,\" he ses, catching 'im by the arm.\n\n\"We've been looking for you a long time,\" ses Keeper Smith, \"and it's a\npleasure for us to 'ave your company.\"\n\nBob Pretty said 'e wouldn't go, but they forced 'im along and took 'im\nall the way to Cudford, four miles off, so that Policeman White could\nlock 'im up for the night.  Mr. White was a'most as pleased as the\nkeepers, and 'e warned Bob solemn not to speak becos all 'e said would be\nused agin 'im.\n\n\"Never mind about that,\" ses Bob Pretty.  \"I've got a clear conscience,\nand talking can't 'urt me.  I'm very glad to see you, Mr. White; if these\ntwo clever, experienced keepers hadn't brought me I should 'ave looked\nyou up myself.  They've been and stole my partridges.\"\n\nThem as was standing round laughed, and even Policeman White couldn't\n'elp giving a little smile.\n\n\"There's nothing to laugh at,\" ses Bob, 'olding his 'ead up.  \"It's a\nfine thing when a working man--a 'ardworking man--can't take home a\nlittle game for 'is family without being stopped and robbed.\"\n\n\"I s'pose they flew into your pocket?\" ses Police-man White.\n\n\"No, they didn't,\" ses Bob.  \"I'm not going to tell any lies about it;\nI put 'em there.  The partridges in my inside coat-pocket and the bill in\nmy waistcoat-pocket.\"\n\n\"The bill?\" ses Keeper Lewis, staring at 'im.\n\n\"Yes, the bill,\" ses Bob Pretty, staring back at 'im; \"the bill from Mr.\nKeen, the poulterer, at Wick-ham.\"\n\nHe fetched it out of 'is pocket and showed it to Mr. White, and the\nkeepers was like madmen a'most 'cos it was plain to see that Bob Pretty\n'ad been and bought them partridges just for to play a game on 'em.\n\n\"I was curious to know wot they tasted like,\" he ses to the policeman.\n\"Worst of it is, I don't s'pose my pore wife'll know 'ow to cook 'em.\"\n\n\"You get off 'ome,\" ses Policeman White, staring at 'im.\n\n\"But ain't I goin' to be locked up?\"  ses Bob.  \"'Ave I been brought all\nthis way just to 'ave a little chat with a policeman I don't like.\"\n\n\"You go 'ome,\" ses Policeman White, handing the partridges back to 'im.\n\n\"All right,\" ses Bob, \"and I may 'ave to call you to witness that these\n'ere two men laid hold o' me and tried to steal my partridges.  I shall\ngo up and see my loryer about it.\"\n\nHe walked off 'ome with his 'ead up as high as 'e could hold it, and the\nairs 'e used to give 'imself arter this was terrible for to behold.  He\ngot 'is eldest boy to write a long letter to the squire about it, saying\nthat 'e'd overlook it this time, but 'e couldn't promise for the future.\nWot with Bob Pretty on one side and Squire Rockett on the other, them two\nkeepers' lives was 'ardly worth living.\n\nThen the squire got a head-keeper named Cutts, a man as was said to know\nmore about the ways of poachers than they did themselves.  He was said to\n'ave cleared out all the poachers for miles round the place 'e came from,\nand pheasants could walk into people's cottages and not be touched.\n\nHe was a sharp-looking man, tall and thin, with screwed-up eyes and a\nlittle red beard.  The second day 'e came 'e was up here at this 'ere\nCauliflower, having a pint o' beer and looking round at the chaps as he\ntalked to the landlord.  The odd thing was that men who'd never taken a\nhare or a pheasant in their lives could 'ardly meet 'is eye, while Bob\nPretty stared at 'im as if 'e was a wax-works.\n\n\"I 'ear you 'ad a little poaching in these parts afore I came,\" ses Mr.\nCutts to the landlord.\n\n\"I think I 'ave 'eard something o' the kind,\" ses the landlord, staring\nover his 'ead with a far-away look in 'is eyes.\n\n\"You won't hear of much more,\" ses the keeper.  \"I've invented a new way\nof catching the dirty rascals; afore I came 'ere I caught all the\npoachers on three estates.  I clear 'em out just like a ferret clears\nout rats.\"\n\n\"Sort o' man-trap?\" ses the landlord.\n\n\"Ah, that's tellings,\" ses Mr. Cutts.\n\n\"Well, I 'ope you'll catch 'em here,\" ses Bob Pretty; \"there's far too\nmany of 'em about for my liking.  Far too many.\"\n\n\"I shall 'ave 'em afore long,\" ses Mr. Cutts, nodding his 'ead.\n\n\"Your good 'ealth,\" ses Bob Pretty, holding up 'is mug.  \"We've been\nwanting a man like you for a long time.\"\n\n\"I don't want any of your impidence, my man,\" ses the keeper.  \"I've\n'eard about you, and nothing good either.  You be careful.\"\n\n\"I am careful,\" ses Bob, winking at the others.  \"I 'ope you'll catch all\nthem low poaching chaps; they give the place a bad name, and I'm a'most\nafraid to go out arter dark for fear of meeting 'em.\"\n\nPeter Gubbins and Sam Jones began to laugh, but Bob Pretty got angry with\n'em and said he didn't see there was anything to laugh at.  He said that\npoaching was a disgrace to their native place, and instead o' laughing\nthey ought to be thankful to Mr. Cutts for coming to do away with it all.\n\n\"Any help I can give you shall be given cheerful,\" he ses to the keeper.\n\n\"When I want your help I'll ask you for it,\" ses Mr. Cutts.\n\n\"Thankee,\" ses Bob Pretty.  \"I on'y 'ope I sha'n't get my face knocked\nabout like yours 'as been, that's all; 'cos my wife's so partikler.\"\n\n\"Wot d'ye mean?\"  ses Mr. Cutts, turning on him.  \"My face ain't been\nknocked about.\"\n\n\"Oh, I beg your pardin,\" ses Bob; \"I didn't know it was natural.\"\n\nMr. Cutts went black in the face a'most and stared at Bob Pretty as if 'e\nwas going to eat 'im, and Bob stared back, looking fust at the keeper's\nnose and then at 'is eyes and mouth, and then at 'is nose agin.\n\n\"You'll know me agin, I s'pose?\" ses Mr. Cutts, at last.\n\n\"Yes,\" ses Bob, smiling; \"I should know you a mile off--on the darkest\nnight.\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" ses Mr. Cutts, taking up 'is beer and turning 'is back on\nhim.  \"Those of us as live the longest'll see the most.\"\n\n\"I'm glad I've lived long enough to see 'im,\" ses Bob to Bill Chambers.\n\"I feel more satisfied with myself now.\"\n\nBill Chambers coughed, and Mr. Cutts, arter finishing 'is beer, took\nanother look at Bob Pretty, and went off boiling a'most.\n\nThe trouble he took to catch Bob Pretty arter that you wouldn't believe,\nand all the time the game seemed to be simply melting away, and Squire\nRockett was finding fault with 'im all day long.  He was worn to a\nshadder a'most with watching, and Bob Pretty seemed to be more prosperous\nthan ever.\n\nSometimes Mr. Cutts watched in the plantations, and sometimes 'e hid\n'imself near Bob's house, and at last one night, when 'e was crouching\nbehind the fence of Frederick Scott's front garden, 'e saw Bob Pretty\ncome out of 'is house and, arter a careful look round, walk up the road.\nHe held 'is breath as Bob passed 'im, and was just getting up to foller\n'im when Bob stopped and walked slowly back agin, sniffing.\n\n\"Wot a delicious smell o' roses!\"  he ses, out loud.\n\nHe stood in the middle o' the road nearly opposite where the keeper was\nhiding, and sniffed so that you could ha' 'eard him the other end o' the\nvillage.\n\n\"It can't be roses,\" he ses, in a puzzled voice, \"be-cos there ain't no\nroses hereabouts, and, besides, it's late for 'em.  It must be Mr. Cutts,\nthe clever new keeper.\"\n\nHe put his 'ead over the fence and bid 'im good evening, and said wot a\nfine night for a stroll it was, and asked 'im whether 'e was waiting for\nFrederick Scott's aunt.  Mr. Cutts didn't answer 'im a word; 'e was\npretty near bursting with passion.  He got up and shook 'is fist in Bob\nPretty's face, and then 'e went off stamping down the road as if 'e was\ngoing mad.\n\nAnd for a time Bob Pretty seemed to 'ave all the luck on 'is side.\nKeeper Lewis got rheumatic fever, which 'e put down to sitting about\nnight arter night in damp places watching for Bob, and, while 'e was in\nthe thick of it, with the doctor going every day, Mr. Cutts fell in\ngetting over a fence and broke 'is leg.  Then all the work fell on Keeper\nSmith, and to 'ear 'im talk you'd think that rheumatic fever and broken\nlegs was better than anything else in the world.  He asked the squire for\n'elp, but the squire wouldn't give it to 'im, and he kept telling 'im wot\na feather in 'is cap it would be if 'e did wot the other two couldn't do,\nand caught Bob Pretty.  It was all very well, but, as Smith said, wot 'e\nwanted was feathers in 'is piller, instead of 'aving to snatch a bit o'\nsleep in 'is chair or sitting down with his 'ead agin a tree.  When I\ntell you that 'e fell asleep in this public-'ouse one night while the\nlandlord was drawing a pint o' beer he 'ad ordered, you'll know wot 'e\nsuffered.\n\nO' course, all this suited Bob Pretty as well as could be, and 'e was\nthat good-tempered 'e'd got a nice word for everybody, and when Bill\nChambers told 'im 'e was foolhardy 'e only laughed and said 'e knew wot\n'e was about.\n\nBut the very next night 'e had reason to remember Bill Chambers's words.\nHe was walking along Farmer Hall's field--the one next to the squire's\nplantation--and, so far from being nervous, 'e was actually a-whistling.\nHe'd got a sack over 'is shoulder, loaded as full as it could be, and 'e\n'ad just stopped to light 'is pipe when three men burst out o' the\nplantation and ran toward 'im as 'ard as they could run.\n\nBob Pretty just gave one look and then 'e dropped 'is pipe and set off\nlike a hare.  It was no good dropping the sack, because Smith, the\nkeeper, 'ad recognised 'im and called 'im by name, so 'e just put 'is\nteeth together and did the best he could, and there's no doubt that if it\n'adn't ha' been for the sack 'e could 'ave got clear away.\n\nAs it was, 'e ran for pretty near a mile, and they could 'ear 'im\nbreathing like a pair o' bellows; but at last 'e saw that the game was\nup.  He just man-aged to struggle as far as Farmer Pinnock's pond, and\nthen, waving the sack round his 'ead, 'e flung it into the middle of it,\nand fell down gasping for breath.\n\n\"Got--you--this time--Bob Pretty,\" ses one o' the men, as they came up.\n\n\"Wot--Mr. Cutts?\"  ses Bob, with a start.  \"That's me, my man,\" ses the\nkeeper.\n\n\"Why--I thought--you was.  Is that Mr. Lewis?  It can't be.\"\n\n\"That's me,\" ses Keeper Lewis.  \"We both got well sudden-like, Bob\nPretty, when we 'eard you was out.  You ain't so sharp as you thought you\nwas.\"\n\nBob Pretty sat still, getting 'is breath back and doing a bit o' thinking\nat the same time.\n\n\"You give me a start,\" he ses, at last.  \"I thought you was both in bed,\nand, knowing 'ow hard worked Mr. Smith 'as been, I just came round to\n'elp 'im keep watch like.  I promised to 'elp you, Mr. Cutts, if you\nremember.\"\n\n\"Wot was that you threw in the pond just now?\" ses Mr. Cutts.\n\n\"A sack,\" ses Bob Pretty; \"a sack I found in Farmer Hall's field.  It\nfelt to me as though it might 'ave birds in it, so I picked it up, and I\nwas just on my way to your 'ouse with it, Mr. Cutts, when you started\narter me.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" ses the keeper, \"and wot did you run for?\"\n\nBob Pretty tried to laugh.  \"Becos I thought it was the poachers arter\nme,\" he ses.  \"It seems ridikilous, don't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, it does,\" ses Lewis.\n\n\"I thought you'd know me a mile off,\" ses Mr. Cutts.  \"I should ha'\nthought the smell o' roses would ha' told you I was near.\"\n\nBob Pretty scratched 'is 'ead and looked at 'im out of the corner of 'is\neye, but he 'adn't got any answer.  Then 'e sat biting his finger-nails\nand thinking while the keepers stood argyfying as to who should take 'is\nclothes off and go into the pond arter the pheasants.  It was a very cold\nnight and the pond was pretty deep in places, and none of 'em seemed\nanxious.\n\n\"Make 'im go in for it,\" ses Lewis, looking at Bob; \"'e chucked it in.\"\n\n\"On'y Becos I thought you was poachers,\" ses Bob.  \"I'm sorry to 'ave\ncaused so much trouble.\"\n\n\"Well, you go in and get it out,\" ses Lewis, who pretty well guessed\nwho'd 'ave to do it if Bob didn't.  \"It'll look better for you, too.\"\n\n\"I've got my defence all right,\" ses Bob Pretty.  \"I ain't set a foot on\nthe squire's preserves, and I found this sack a 'undred yards away from\nit.\"\n\n\"Don't waste more time,\" ses Mr. Cutts to Lewis.\n\n\"Off with your clothes and in with you.  Anybody'd think you was afraid\nof a little cold water.\"\n\n\"Whereabouts did 'e pitch it in?\"  ses Lewis.\n\nBob Pretty pointed with 'is finger exactly where 'e thought it was, but\nthey wouldn't listen to 'im, and then Lewis, arter twice saying wot a bad\ncold he'd got, took 'is coat off very slow and careful.\n\n\"I wouldn't mind going in to oblige you,\" ses Bob Pretty, \"but the pond\nis so full o' them cold, slimy efts; I don't fancy them crawling up agin\nme, and, besides that, there's such a lot o' deep holes in it.  And\nwotever you do don't put your 'ead under; you know 'ow foul that water\nis.\"\n\nKeeper Lewis pretended not to listen to 'im.  He took off 'is clothes\nvery slowly and then 'e put one foot in and stood shivering, although\nSmith, who felt the water with his 'and, said it was quite warm.  Then\nLewis put the other foot in and began to walk about careful, 'arf-way up\nto 'is knees.\n\n\"I can't find it,\" he ses, with 'is teeth chattering.\n\n\"You 'aven't looked,\" ses Mr. Cutts; \"walk about more; you can't expect\nto find it all at once.  Try the middle.\"\n\nLewis tried the middle, and 'e stood there up to 'is neck, feeling about\nwith his foot and saying things out loud about Bob Pretty, and other\nthings under 'is breath about Mr. Cutts.\n\n\"Well, I'm going off 'ome,\" ses Bob Pretty, getting up.  \"I'm too\ntender-'arted to stop and see a man drownded.\"\n\n\"You stay 'ere,\" ses Mr. Cutts, catching 'old of him.\n\n\"Wot for?\" ses Bob; \"you've got no right to keep me 'ere.\"\n\n\"Catch 'old of 'im, Joe,\" ses Mr. Cutts, quick-like.\n\nSmith caught 'old of his other arm, and Lewis left off trying to find the\nsack to watch the struggle.  Bob Pretty fought 'ard, and once or twice 'e\nnearly tumbled Mr. Cutts into the pond, but at last 'e gave in and lay\ndown panting and talking about 'is loryer.  Smith 'eld him down on the\nground while Mr. Cutts kept pointing out places with 'is finger for Lewis\nto walk to.  The last place 'e pointed to wanted a much taller man, but\nit wasn't found out till too late, and the fuss Keeper Lewis made when 'e\ncould speak agin was terrible.\n\n\"You'd better come out,\" ses Mr. Cutts; \"you ain't doing no good.  We\nknow where they are and we'll watch the pond till daylight--that is,\nunless Smith 'ud like to 'ave a try.\"\n\n\"It's pretty near daylight now, I think,\" ses Smith.\n\nLewis came out and ran up and down to dry 'imself, and finished off on\n'is pocket-'andkerchief, and then with 'is teeth chattering 'e began to\ndress 'imself.  He got 'is shirt on, and then 'e stood turning over 'is\nclothes as if 'e was looking for something.\n\n\"Never mind about your stud now,\" ses Mr. Cutts; \"hurry up and dress.\"\n\n\"Stud?\" ses Lewis, very snappish.  \"I'm looking for my trowsis.\"\n\n\"Your trowsis?\" ses Smith, 'elping 'im look.\n\n\"I put all my clothes together,\" ses Lewis, a'most shouting.  \"Where are\nthey?  I'm 'arf perished with cold.  Where are they?\"\n\n\"He 'ad 'em on this evening,\" ses Bob Pretty, \"'cos I remember noticing\n'em.\"\n\n\"They must be somewhere about,\" ses Mr. Cutts; \"why don't you use your\neyes?\"\n\nHe walked up and down, peering about, and as for Lewis he was 'opping\nround 'arf crazy.\n\n\"I wonder,\" ses Bob Pretty, in a thoughtful voice, to Smith--\"I wonder\nwhether you or Mr. Cutts kicked 'em in the pond while you was struggling\nwith me.  Come to think of it, I seem to remember 'earing a splash.\"\n\n\"He's done it, Mr. Cutts,\" ses Smith; \"never mind, it'll go all the\n'arder with 'im.\"\n\n\"But I do mind,\" ses Lewis, shouting.  \"I'll be even with you for this,\nBob Pretty.  I'll make you feel it.  You wait till I've done with you.\nYou'll get a month extra for this, you see if you don't.\"\n\n\"Don't you mind about me,\" ses Bob; \"you run off 'ome and cover up them\nlegs of yours.  I found that sack, so my conscience is clear.\"\n\nLewis put on 'is coat and waistcoat and set off, and Mr. Cutts and Smith,\narter feeling about for a dry place, set theirselves down and began to\nsmoke.\n\n\"Look 'ere,\" ses Bob Pretty, \"I'm not going to sit 'ere all night to\nplease you; I'm going off 'ome.  If you want me you'll know where to find\nme.\"\n\n\"You stay where you are,\" ses Mr. Cutts.  \"We ain't going to let you out\nof our sight.\"\n\n\"Very well, then, you take me 'ome,\" ses Bob.  \"I'm not going to catch my\ndeath o' cold sitting 'ere.  I'm not used to being out of a night like\nyou are.  I was brought up respectable.\"\n\n\"I dare say,\" ses Mr. Cutts.  \"Take you 'ome, and then 'ave one o' your\nmates come and get the sack while we're away.\"\n\nThen Bob Pretty lost 'is temper, and the things 'e said about Mr. Cutts\nwasn't fit for Smith to 'ear.  He threw 'imself down at last full length\non the ground and sulked till the day broke.\n\nKeeper Lewis was there a'most as soon as it was light, with some long\nhay-rakes he'd borrowed, and I should think that pretty near 'arf the\nfolks in Clay-bury 'ad turned up to see the fun.  Mrs. Pretty was crying\nand wringing 'er 'ands; but most folks seemed to be rather pleased that\nBob 'ad been caught at last.\n\nIn next to no time 'arf-a-dozen rakes was at work, and the things they\nbrought out o' that pond you wouldn't believe.  The edge of it was all\nlittered with rusty tin pails and saucepans and such-like, and by-and-by\nLewis found the things he'd 'ad to go 'ome without a few hours afore, but\nthey didn't seem to find that sack, and Bob Pretty, wot was talking to\n'is wife, began to look 'opeful.\n\nBut just then the squire came riding up with two friends as was staying\nwith 'im, and he offered a reward of five shillings to the man wot found\nit.  Three or four of 'em waded in up to their middle then and raked\ntheir 'ardest, and at last Henery Walker give a cheer and brought it to\nthe side, all heavy with water.\n\n\"That's the sack I found, sir,\" ses Bob, starting up.  \"It wasn't on your\nland at all, but on the field next to it.  I'm an honest, 'ardworking\nman, and I've never been in trouble afore.  Ask anybody 'ere and they'll\ntell you the same.\"\n\nSquire Rockett took no notice of 'im.  \"Is that the sack?\"  he asks,\nturning to Mr. Cutts.\n\n\"That's the one, sir,\" ses Mr. Cutts.  \"I'd swear to it anywhere.\"\n\n\"You'd swear a man's life away,\" ses Bob.  \"'Ow can you swear to it when\nit was dark?\"\n\nMr. Cutts didn't answer 'im.  He went down on 'is knees and cut the\nstring that tied up the mouth o' the sack, and then 'e started back as if\n'e'd been shot, and 'is eyes a'most started out of 'is 'ead.\n\n\"Wot's the matter?\" ses the squire.\n\nMr. Cutts couldn't speak; he could only stutter and point at the sack\nwith 'is finger, and Henery Walker, as was getting curious, lifted up the\nother end of it and out rolled a score of as fine cabbages as you could\nwish to see.\n\nI never see people so astonished afore in all my born days, and as for\nBob Pretty, 'e stood staring at them cabbages as if 'e couldn't believe\n'is eyesight.\n\n\"And that's wot I've been kept 'ere all night for,\" he ses, at last,\nshaking his 'ead.  \"That's wot comes o' trying to do a kindness to\nkeepers, and 'elping of 'em in their difficult work.  P'r'aps that ain't\nthe sack arter all, Mr. Cutts.  I could ha' sworn they was pheasants in\nthe one I found, but I may be mistook, never 'aving 'ad one in my 'ands\nafore.  Or p'r'aps somebody was trying to 'ave a game with you, Mr.\nCutts, and deceived me instead.\"\n\nThe keepers on'y stared at 'im.\n\n\"You ought to be more careful,\" ses Bob.  \"Very likely while you was\ntaking all that trouble over me, and Keeper Lewis was catching 'is death\no' cold, the poachers was up at the plantation taking all they wanted.\nAnd, besides, it ain't right for Squire Rockett to 'ave to pay Henery\nWalker five shillings for finding a lot of old cabbages.  I shouldn't\nlike it myself.\"\n\nHe looked out of the corner of 'is eye at the squire, as was pretending\nnot to notice Henery Walker touching 'is cap to him, and then 'e turns to\n'is wife and he ses:\n\n\"Come along, old gal,\" 'e ses.  \"I want my breakfast bad, and arter that\nI shall 'ave to lose a honest day's work in bed.\"",
