    "body": "The man in the white jacket stopped at the door marked \"Re-Education\nProject--Col. H. H. Mudgett, Commanding Officer\" and waited while the\nscanner looked him over. He had been through that door a thousand\ntimes, but the scanner made as elaborate a job of it as if it had never\nseen him before.\n\nIt always did, for there was always in fact a chance that it _had_\nnever seen him before, whatever the fallible human beings to whom it\nreported might think. It went over him from grey, crew-cut poll to\nreagent-proof shoes, checking his small wiry body and lean profile\nagainst its stored silhouettes, tasting and smelling him as dubiously\nas if he were an orange held in storage two days too long.\n\n\"Name?\" it said at last.\n\n\"Carson, Samuel, 32-454-0698.\"\n\n\"Business?\"\n\n\"Medical director, Re-Ed One.\"\n\nWhile Carson waited, a distant, heavy concussion came rolling down\nupon him through the mile of solid granite above his head. At the same\nmoment, the letters on the door--and everything else inside his cone\nof vision--blurred distressingly, and a stab of pure pain went lancing\nthrough his head. It was the supersonic component of the explosion, and\nit was harmless--except that it always both hurt and scared him.\n\nThe light on the door-scanner, which had been glowing yellow up to\nnow, flicked back to red again and the machine began the whole routine\nall over; the sound-bomb had reset it. Carson patiently endured its\ninspection, gave his name, serial number and mission once more, and\nthis time got the green. He went in, unfolding as he walked the flimsy\nsquare of cheap paper he had been carrying all along.\n\nMudgett looked up from his desk and said at once: \"What now?\"\n\nThe physician tossed the square of paper down under Mudgett's eyes.\n\"Summary of the press reaction to Hamelin's speech last night,\" he\nsaid. \"The total effect is going against us, Colonel. Unless we can\nchange Hamelin's mind, this outcry to re-educate civilians ahead of\nsoldiers is going to lose the war for us. The urge to live on the\nsurface again has been mounting for ten years; now it's got a target to\nfocus on. Us.\"\n\nMudgett chewed on a pencil while he read the summary; a blocky, bulky\nman, as short as Carson and with hair as grey and close-cropped. A\nyear ago, Carson would have told him that nobody in Re-Ed could afford\nto put stray objects in his mouth even once, let alone as a habit;\nnow Carson just waited. There wasn't a man--or a woman or a child--of\nAmerica's surviving thirty-five million \"sane\" people who didn't have\nsome such tic. Not now, not after twenty-five years of underground life.\n\n\"He knows it's impossible, doesn't he?\" Mudgett demanded abruptly.\n\n\"Of course he doesn't,\" Carson said impatiently. \"He doesn't know any\nmore about the real nature of the project than the people do. He thinks\nthe 'educating' we do is in some sort of survival technique--That's\nwhat the papers think, too, as you can plainly see by the way they\nloaded that editorial.\"\n\n\"Um. If we'd taken direct control of the papers in the first place--\"\n\nCarson said nothing. Military control of every facet of civilian life\nwas a fact, and Mudgett knew it. He also knew that an appearance\nof freedom to think is a necessity for the human mind--and that\nthe appearance could not be maintained without a few shreds of the\nactuality.\n\n\"Suppose we do this,\" Mudgett said at last. \"Hamelin's position in\nthe State Department makes it impossible for us to muzzle him. But it\nought to be possible to explain to him that no unprotected human being\ncan live on the surface, no matter how many Merit Badges he has for\nwoodcraft and first aid. Maybe we could even take him on a little trip\ntopside; I'll wager he's never seen it.\"\n\n\"And what if he dies up there?\" Carson said stonily. \"We lose\nthree-fifths of every topside party as it is--and Hamelin's an\ninexperienced--\"\n\n\"Might be the best thing, mightn't it?\"\n\n\"_No_,\" Carson said. \"It would look like we'd planned it that way. The\npapers would have the populace boiling by the next morning.\"\n\nMudgett groaned and nibbled another double row of indentations around\nthe barrel of the pencil. \"There must be something,\" he said.\n\n\"There is.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Bring the man here and show him just what we _are_ doing. Re-educate\n_him_, if necessary. Once we told the newspapers that he'd taken the\ncourse ... well, who knows, they just might resent it. Abusing his\nclearance privileges and so on.\"\n\n\"We'd be violating our basic policy,\" Mudgett said slowly. \"'Give\nthe Earth back to the men who fight for it.' Still, the idea has some\nmerits....\"\n\n\"Hamelin is out in the antechamber right now,\" Carson said. \"Shall I\nbring him in?\"\n\n\n\nThe radioactivity never did rise much beyond a mildly hazardous level,\nand that was only transient, during the second week of the war--the\nweek called the Death of Cities. The small shards of sanity retained\nby the high commands on both sides dictated avoiding weapons with\na built-in backfire: no cobalt bombs were dropped, no territories\npermanently poisoned. Generals still remembered that unoccupied\nterritory, no matter how devastated, is still unconquered territory.\n\nBut no such considerations stood in the way of biological warfare. It\nwas controllable: you never released against the enemy any disease you\ndidn't yourself know how to control. There would be some slips, of\ncourse, but the margin for error--\n\nThere were some slips. But for the most part, biological warfare worked\nfine. The great fevers washed like tides around and around the globe,\none after another. In such cities as had escaped the bombings, the\nrumble of truck convoys carrying the puffed heaped corpses to the mass\ngraves became the only sound except for sporadic small-arms fire; and\nthen that too ceased, and the trucks stood rusting in rows.\n\nNor were human beings the sole victims. Cattle fevers were sent\nout. Wheat rusts, rice molds, corn blights, hog choleras, poultry\nenteritises fountained into the indifferent air from the hidden\nlaboratories, or were loosed far aloft, in the jet-stream, by\nrocketing fleets. Gelatin capsules pullulating with gill-rots fell\nlike hail into the great fishing grounds of Newfoundland, Oregon,\nJapan, Sweden, Portugal. Hundreds of species of animals were drafted\nas secondary hosts for human diseases, were injected and released to\ncarry the blessings of the laboratories to their mates and litters.\nIt was discovered that minute amounts of the tetracycline series of\nantibiotics, which had long been used as feed supplements to bring farm\nanimals to full market weight early, could also be used to raise the\nmost whopping Anopheles and A\u00ebdes mosquitoes anybody ever saw, capable\nof flying long distances against the wind and of carrying a peculiarly\ninteresting new strains of the malarial parasite and the yellow fever\nvirus....\n\nBy the time it had ended, everyone who remained alive was a mile under\nground.\n\nFor good.\n\n\n\n\"I still fail to understand why,\" Hamelin said, \"if, as you claim, you\nhave methods of re-educating soldiers for surface life, you can't do so\nfor civilians as well. Or instead.\"\n\nThe under-secretary, a tall, spare man, bald on top, and with a heavily\ncreased forehead, spoke with the odd neutral accent--untinged by\nregionalism--of the trained diplomat, despite the fact that there had\nbeen no such thing as a foreign service for nearly half a century.\n\n\"We're going to try to explain that to you,\" Carson said. \"But we\nthought that, first of all, we'd try to explain once more why we think\nit would be bad policy--as well as physically out of the question.\n\n\"Sure, everybody wants to go topside as soon as it's possible. Even\npeople who are reconciled to these endless caverns and corridors hope\nfor something better for their children--a glimpse of sunlight, a\nlittle rain, the fall of a leaf. That's more important now to all of us\nthan the war, which we don't believe in any longer. That doesn't even\nmake any military sense, since we haven't the numerical strength to\noccupy the enemy's territory any more, and they haven't the strength to\noccupy ours. We understand all that. But we also know that the enemy is\nintent on prosecuting the war to the end. Extermination is what they\nsay they want, on their propaganda broadcasts, and your own Department\nreports that they seem to mean what they say. So we can't give up\nfighting them; that would be simple suicide. Are you still with me?\"\n\n\"Yes, but I don't see--\"\n\n\"Give me a moment more. If we have to continue to fight, we know\nthis much: that the first of the two sides to get men on the surface\nagain--so as to be able to _attack_ important targets, not just keep\nthem isolated in seas of plagues--will be the side that will bring this\nwar to an end. They know that, too. We have good reason to believe\nthat they have a re-education project, and that it's about as far\nadvanced as ours is.\"\n\n\"Look at it this way,\" Col. Mudgett burst in unexpectedly. \"What we\nhave now is a stalemate. A saboteur occasionally locates one of the\nunderground cities and lets the pestilences into it. Sometimes on our\nside, sometimes on theirs. But that only happens sporadically, and\nit's just more of this mutual extermination business--to which we're\ncommitted, willy-nilly, for as long as they are. If we can get troops\nonto the surface first, we'll be able to scout out their important\ninstallations in short order, and issue them a surrender ultimatum with\nteeth in it. They'll take it. The only other course is the sort of\nslow, mutual suicide we've got now.\"\n\nHamelin put the tips of his fingers together. \"You gentlemen lecture\nme about policy as if I had never heard the word before. I'm familiar\nwith your arguments for sending soldiers first. You assume that you're\nfamiliar with all of mine for starting with civilians, but you're\nwrong, because some of them haven't been brought up at all outside the\nDepartment. I'm going to tell you some of them, and I think they'll\nmerit your close attention.\"\n\nCarson shrugged. \"I'd like nothing better than to be convinced, Mr.\nSecretary. Go ahead.\"\n\n\"You of all people should know, Dr. Carson, how close our underground\nsociety is to a psychotic break. To take a single instance, the number\nof juvenile gangs roaming these corridors of ours has increased 400%\nsince the rumors about the Re-Education Project began to spread.\nOr another: the number of individual crimes without motive--crimes\ncommitted, just to distract the committer from the grinding monotony of\nthe life we all lead--has now passed the total of all other crimes put\ntogether.\n\n\"And as for actual insanity--of our thirty-five million people still\nunhospitalized, there are four million cases _of which we know_,\neach one of which should be committed right now for early paranoid\nschizophrenia--except that were we to commit them, our essential\nindustries would suffer a manpower loss more devastating than anything\nthe enemy has inflicted upon us. Every one of those four million\npersons is a major hazard to his neighbors and to his job, but how\ncan we do without them? And what can we do about the unrecognized,\nsub-clinical cases, which probably total twice as many? How long can we\ncontinue operating without a collapse under such conditions?\"\n\nCarson mopped his brow. \"I didn't suspect that it had gone that far.\"\n\n\"It has gone that far,\" Hamelin said icily, \"and it is accelerating.\nYour own project has helped to accelerate it. Col. Mudgett here\nmentioned the opening of isolated cities to the pestilences. Shall I\ntell you how Louisville fell?\"\n\n\"A spy again, I suppose,\" Mudgett said.\n\n\"No, Colonel. Not a spy. A band of--of vigilantes, of mutineers. I'm\nfamiliar with your slogan, 'The Earth to those who fight for it.' Do\nyou know the counter-slogan that's circulating among the people?\"\n\nThey waited. Hamelin smiled and said: \"'Let's die on the surface.'\n\n\"They overwhelmed the military detachment there, put the city\nadministration to death, and blew open the shaft to the surface. About\na thousand people actually made it to the top. Within twenty-four hours\nthe city was dead--as the ringleaders had been warned would be the\noutcome. The warning didn't deter them. Nor did it protect the prudent\ncitizens who had no part in the affair.\"\n\nHamelin leaned forward suddenly. \"People won't wait to be told when\nit's their turn to be re-educated. They'll be tired of waiting, tired\nto the point of insanity of living at the bottom of a hole. They'll\njust go.\n\n\"And that, gentlemen, will leave the world to the enemy ... or, more\nlikely, the rats. They alone are immune to everything by now.\"\n\nThere was a long silence. At last Carson said mildly: \"Why aren't _we_\nimmune to everything by now?\"\n\n\"Eh? Why--the new generations. They've never been exposed.\"\n\n\"We still have a reservoir of older people who lived through the war:\npeople who had one or several of the new diseases that swept the\nworld, some as many as five, and yet recovered. They still have their\nimmunities; we know; we've tested them. We know from sampling that no\nnew disease has been introduced by either side in over ten years now.\nAgainst all the known ones, we have immunization techniques, anti-sera,\nantibiotics, and so on. I suppose you get your shots every six months\nlike all the rest of us; we should all be very hard to infect now, and\nsuch infections as do take should run mild courses.\" Carson held the\nunder-secretary's eyes grimly. \"Now, answer me this question: why is it\nthat, despite all these protections, _every single person_ in an opened\ncity dies?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Hamelin said, staring at each of them in turn. \"By your\nshowing, some of them should recover.\"\n\n\"They should,\" Carson said. \"But nobody does. Why? Because the very\nnature of disease has changed since we all went underground. There are\nnow abroad in the world a number of mutated bacterial strains which can\nbypass the immunity mechanisms of the human body altogether. What this\nmeans in simple terms is that, should such a germ get into your body,\nyour body wouldn't recognize it as an invader. It would manufacture\nno antibodies against the germ. Consequently, the germ could multiply\nwithout any check, and--you would die. So would we all.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Hamelin said. He seemed to have recovered his composure\nextraordinarily rapidly. \"I am no scientist, gentlemen, but what you\ntell me makes our position sound perfectly hopeless. Yet obviously you\nhave some answer.\"\n\nCarson nodded. \"We do. But it's important for you to understand the\nsituation, otherwise the answer will mean nothing to you. So: is it\nperfectly clear to you now, from what we've said so far, that no amount\nof re-educating a man's brain, be he soldier _or_ civilian, will allow\nhim to survive on the surface?\"\n\n\"Quite clear,\" Hamelin said, apparently ungrudgingly. Carson's hopes\nrose by a fraction of a millimeter. \"But if you don't re-educate his\nbrain, what can you re-educate? His reflexes, perhaps?\"\n\n\"No,\" Carson said. \"His lymph nodes, and his spleen.\"\n\nA scornful grin began to appear on Hamelin's thin lips. \"You need\nbetter public relations counsel than you've been getting,\" he said.\n\"If what you say is true--as of course I assume it is--then the term\n're-educate' is not only inappropriate, it's downright misleading.\nIf you had chosen a less suggestive and more accurate label in the\nbeginning, I wouldn't have been able to cause you half the trouble I\nhave.\"\n\n\"I agree that we were badly advised there,\" Carson said. \"But not\nentirely for those reasons. Of course the name is misleading; that's\nboth a characteristic and a function of the names of top secret\nprojects. But in this instance, the name 'Re-Education', bad as it now\nappears, subjected the men who chose it to a fatal temptation. You see,\nthough it is misleading, it is also entirely accurate.\"\n\n\"Word-games,\" Hamelin said.\n\n\"Not at all,\" Mudgett interposed. \"We were going to spare you the\ntheoretical reasoning behind our project, Mr. Secretary, but now\nyou'll just have to sit still for it. The fact is that the body's\nability to distinguish between its own cells and those of some foreign\ntissue--a skin graft, say, or a bacterial invasion of the blood--isn't\nan inherited ability. It's a learned reaction. Furthermore, if you'll\nthink about it a moment, you'll see that it has to be. Body cells die,\ntoo, and have to be disposed of; what would happen if removing those\ndead cells provoked an antibody reaction, as the destruction of foreign\ncells does? We'd die of anaphylactic shock while we were still infants.\n\n\"For that reason, the body has to learn how to scavenge selectively.\nIn human beings, that lesson isn't learned completely until about a\nmonth after birth. During the intervening time, the newborn infant is\nprotected by antibodies that it gets from the colestrum, the 'first\nmilk' it gets from the breast during the three or four days immediately\nafter birth. It can't generate its own; it isn't allowed to, so to\nspeak, until it's learned the trick of cleaning up body residues\n_without_ triggering the antibody mechanisms. Any dead cells marked\n'personal' have to be dealt with some other way.\"\n\n\"That seems clear enough,\" Hamelin said. \"But I don't see its\nrelevance.\"\n\n\"Well, we're in a position now where that differentiation between the\nself and everything outside the body doesn't do us any good any more.\nThese mutated bacteria have been 'selfed' by the mutation. In other\nwords, some of their protein molecules, probably desoxyribonucleic acid\nmolecules, carry configurations or 'recognition-units' identical with\nthose of our body cells, so that the body can't tell one from another.\"\n\n\"But what has all this to do with re-education?\"\n\n\"Just this,\" Carson said. \"What we do here is to impose upon the cells\nof the body--all of them--a new set of recognition-units for the\nguidance of the lymph nodes and the spleen, which are the organs that\nproduce antibodies. The new units are highly complex, and the chances\nof their being duplicated by bacterial evolution, even under forced\ndraught, are too small to worry about. That's what Re-Education is. In\na few moments, if you like, we'll show you just how it's done.\"\n\nHamelin ground out his fifth cigarette in Mudgett's ashtray and placed\nthe tips of his fingers together thoughtfully. Carson wondered just\nhow much of the concept of recognition-marking the under-secretary had\nabsorbed. It had to be admitted that he was astonishingly quick to\ntake hold of abstract ideas, but the self-marker theory of immunity\nwas--like everything else in immunology--almost impossible to explain\nto laymen, no matter how intelligent.\n\n\"This process,\" Hamelin said hesitantly. \"It takes a long time?\"\n\n\"About six hours per subject, and we can handle only one man at a time.\nThat means that we can count on putting no more than seven thousand\ntroops into the field by the turn of the century. Every one will have\nto be a highly trained specialist, if we're to bring the war to a quick\nconclusion.\"\n\n\"Which means no civilians,\" Hamelin said. \"I see. I'm not entirely\nconvinced, but--by all means let's see how it's done.\"\n\n\n\nOnce inside, the under-secretary tried his best to look everywhere at\nonce. The room cut into the rock was roughly two hundred feet high.\nMost of it was occupied by the bulk of the Re-Education Monitor, a\nmechanism as tall as a fifteen-storey building, and about a city block\nsquare. Guards watched it on all sides, and the face of the machine\nswarmed with technicians.\n\n\"Incredible,\" Hamelin murmured. \"That enormous object can process only\none man at a time?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Mudgett said. \"Luckily it doesn't have to treat all the\nbody cells directly. It works through the blood, re-selfing the cells\nby means of small changes in the serum chemistry.\"\n\n\"What kind of changes?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Carson said, choosing each word carefully, \"that's more or\nless a graveyard secret, Mr. Secretary. We can tell you this much: the\nmachine uses a vast array of crystalline, complex sugars which _behave_\nrather like the blood group-and-type proteins. They're fed into the\nserum in minute amounts, under feedback control of second-by-second\nanalysis of the blood. The computations involved in deciding upon the\namount and the precise nature of each introduced chemical are highly\ncomplex. Hence the size of the machine. It is, in its major effect, an\nartificial kidney.\"\n\n\"I've seen artificial kidneys in the hospitals,\" Hamelin said,\nfrowning. \"They're rather compact affairs.\"\n\n\"Because all they do is remove waste products from the patient's\nblood, and restore the fluid and electrolyte balance. Those are very\nminor renal functions in the higher mammals. The organ's main duty is\nchemical control of immunity. If Burnet and Fenner had known that back\nin 1949, when the selfing theory was being formulated, we'd have had\nRe-Education long before now.\"\n\n\"Most of the machine's size is due to the computation section,\" Mudgett\nemphasized. \"In the body, the brain-stem does those computations, as\npart of maintaining homeostasis. But we can't reach the brain-stem from\noutside; it's not under conscious control. Once the body is re-selfed,\nit will re-train the thalamus where we can't.\" Suddenly, two swinging\ndoors at the base of the machine were pushed apart and a mobile\noperating table came through, guided by two attendants. There was a\nform on it, covered to the chin with a sheet. The face above the sheet\nwas immobile and almost as white.\n\nHamelin watched the table go out of the huge cavern with visibly mixed\nemotions. He said: \"This process--it's painful?\"\n\n\"No, not exactly,\" Carson said. The motive behind the question\ninterested him hugely, but he didn't dare show it. \"But any fooling\naround with the immunity mechanisms can give rise to symptoms--fever,\ngeneral malaise, and so on. We try to protect our subjects by giving\nthem a light shock anesthesia first.\"\n\n\"Shock?\" Hamelin repeated. \"You mean electroshock? I don't see how--\"\n\n\"Call it stress anesthesia instead. We give the man a steroid drug that\ncounterfeits the anesthesia the body itself produces in moments of\ngreat stress--on the battlefield, say, or just after a serious injury.\nIt's fast, and free of after-effects. There's no secret about that,\nby the way; the drug involved is 21-hydroxypregnane-3,20 dione sodium\nsuccinate, and it dates all the way back to 1955.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" the under-secretary said. The ringing sound of the chemical name\nhad had, as Carson had hoped, a ritually soothing effect.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" Hamelin said hesitantly. \"Gentlemen, I have a--a rather\nunusual request. And, I am afraid, a rather selfish one.\" A brief,\nnervous laugh. \"Selfish in both senses, if you will pardon me the pun.\nYou need feel no hesitation in refusing me, but....\"\n\nAbruptly he appeared to find it impossible to go on. Carson mentally\ncrossed his fingers and plunged in.\n\n\"You would like to undergo the process yourself?\" he said.\n\n\"Well, yes. Yes, that's exactly it. Does that seem inconsistent? I\nshould know, should I not, what it is that I'm advocating for my\nfollowing? Know it intimately, from personal experience, not just\ntheory? Of course I realize that it would conflict with your policy,\nbut I assure you I wouldn't turn it to any political advantage--none\nwhatsoever. And perhaps it wouldn't be too great a lapse of policy to\nprocess just one civilian among your seven thousand soldiers.\"\n\nSubverted, by God! Carson looked at Mudgett with a firmly straight\nface. It wouldn't do to accept too quickly.\n\nBut Hamelin was rushing on, almost chattering now. \"I can understand\nyour hesitation. You must feel that I'm trying to gain some advantage,\nor even to get to the surface ahead of my fellow-men. If it will set\nyour minds at rest, I would be glad to enlist in your advance army.\nBefore five years are up, I could surely learn some technical skill\nwhich would make me useful to the expedition. If you would prepare\npapers to that effect, I'd be happy to sign them.\"\n\n\"That's hardly necessary,\" Mudgett said. \"After you're Re-Educated, we\ncan simply announce the fact, and say that you've agreed to join the\nadvance party when the time comes.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Hamelin said. \"I see the difficulty. No, that would make my\nposition quite impossible. If there is no other way--\"\n\n\"Excuse us a moment,\" Carson said. Hamelin bowed, and the doctor pulled\nMudgett off out of ear-shot.\n\n\"Don't overplay it,\" he murmured. \"You're tipping our hand with that\ntalk about a press release, Colonel. He's offering us a bribe--but he's\nplenty smart enough to see that the price you're suggesting is that of\nhis whole political career. He won't pay that much.\"\n\n\"What then?\" Mudgett whispered hoarsely.\n\n\"Get somebody to prepare the kind of informal contract he suggested.\nOffer to put it under security seal so we won't be able to show it\nto the press at all. He'll know well enough that such a seal can be\nbroken if our policy ever comes before a presidential review--and that\nwill restrain him from forcing such a review. Let's not demand too\nmuch. Once he's been re-educated, he'll have to live the rest of the\nfive years with the knowledge that he _can_ live topside any time he\nwants to try it--and he hasn't had the discipline our men have had.\nIt's my bet that he'll goof off before the five years are up--and good\nriddance.\"\n\nThey went back to Hamelin, who was watching the machine and humming in\na painfully abstracted manner.\n\n\"I've convinced the Colonel,\" Carson said, \"that your services in the\narmy might well be very valuable when the time comes, Mr. Secretary. If\nyou'll sign up, we'll put the papers under security seal for your own\nprotection, and then I think we can fit you into our treatment program\ntoday.\"\n\n\"I'm grateful to you, Dr. Carson,\" Hamelin said. \"Very grateful,\nindeed.\"\n\n\n\nFive minutes after his injection, Hamelin was as peaceful as a flounder\nand was rolled through the swinging doors. An hour's discussion of the\nprobable outcome, carried on in the privacy of Mudgett's office, bore\nvery little additional fruit, however.\n\n\"It's our only course,\" Carson said. \"It's what we hoped to gain from\nhis visit, duly modified by circumstances. It all comes down to this:\nHamelin's compromised himself, and he knows it.\"\n\n\"But,\" Mudgett said, \"suppose he was right? What about all that talk of\nhis about mass insanity?\"\n\n\"I'm sure it's true,\" Carson said, his voice trembling slightly despite\nhis best efforts at control. \"It's going to be rougher than ever down\nhere for the next five years, Colonel. Our only consolation is that the\nenemy must have exactly the same problem; and if we can beat them to\nthe surface--\"\n\n\"_Hsst!_\" Mudgett said. Carson had already broken off his sentence. He\nwondered why the scanner gave a man such a hard time outside that door,\nand then admitted him without any warning to the people on the other\nside. Couldn't the damned thing be trained to knock?\n\nThe newcomer was a page from the haemotology section. \"Here's the\npreliminary rundown on your 'Student X', Dr. Carson,\" he said.\n\nThe page saluted Mudgett and went out. Carson began to read. After a\nmoment, he also began to sweat.\n\n\"Colonel, look at this. I was wrong after all. Disastrously wrong. I\nhaven't seen a blood-type distribution pattern like Hamelin's since I\nwas a medical student, and even back then it was only a demonstration,\nnot a real live patient. Look at it from the genetic point of view--the\nmigration factors.\"\n\nHe passed the protocol across the desk. Mudgett was not by background\na scientist, but he was an enormously able administrator, of the breed\nthat makes it its business to know the technicalities on which any\nproject ultimately rests. He was not much more than half-way through\nthe tally before his eyebrows were gaining altitude like shock-waves.\n\n\"Carson, we can't let that man into the machine! He's--\"\n\n\"He's already in it, Colonel, you know that. And if we interrupt the\nprocess before it runs to term, we'll kill him.\"\n\n\"Let's kill him, then,\" Mudgett said harshly. \"Say he died while being\nprocessed. Do the country a favor.\"\n\n\"That would produce a hell of a stink. Besides, we have no proof.\"\n\nMudgett flourished the protocol excitedly.\n\n\"That's not proof to anyone but a haemotologist.\"\n\n\"But Carson, the man's a saboteur!\" Mudgett shouted. \"Nobody but an\nAsiatic could have a typing pattern like this! And he's no melting-pot\nproduct, either--he's a classical mixture, very probably a Georgian.\nAnd every move he's made since we first heard of him has been aimed\ndirectly at us--aimed directly at tricking us into getting him into the\nmachine!\"\n\n\"I think so too,\" Carson said grimly. \"I just hope the enemy hasn't\nmany more agents as brilliant.\"\n\n\"One's enough,\" Mudgett said. \"He's sure to be loaded to the last cc of\nhis blood with catalyst poisons. Once the machine starts processing\nhis serum, we're done for--it'll take us years to re-program the\ncomputer, if it can be done at all. It's _got_ to be stopped!\"\n\n\"Stopped?\" Carson said, astonished. \"But it's already stopped. That's\nnot what worries me. The machine stopped it fifty minutes ago.\"\n\n\"It can't have! How could it? It has no relevant data!\"\n\n\"Sure it has.\" Carson leaned forward, took the cruelly chewed pencil\naway from Mudgett, and made a neat check beside one of the entries on\nthe protocol. Mudgett stared at the checked item.\n\n\"Platelets Rh VI?\" he mumbled. \"But what's that got to do with.... Oh.\nOh, I see. That platelet type doesn't exist at all in our population\nnow, does it? Never seen it before myself, at least.\"\n\n\"No,\" Carson said, grinning wolfishly. \"It never was common in the\nWest, and the pogrom of 1981 wiped it out. That's something the enemy\ncouldn't know. But the machine knows it. As soon as it gives him the\nstandard anti-IV desensitization shot, his platelets will begin to\ndissolve--and he'll be rejected for incipient thrombocytopenia.\" He\nlaughed. \"For his own protection! But--\"\n\n\"But he's getting nitrous oxide in the machine, and he'll be held six\nhours under anesthesia anyhow--also for his own protection,\" Mudgett\nbroke in. He was grinning back at Carson like an idiot. \"When he comes\nout from under, he'll assume that he's been re-educated, and he'll beat\nit back to the enemy to report that he's poisoned our machine, so\nthat they can be sure they'll beat us to the surface. And he'll go the\nfastest way: _overland_.\"\n\n\"He will,\" Carson agreed. \"Of course he'll go overland, and of course\nhe'll die. But where does that leave us? We won't be able to conceal\nthat he was treated here, if there's any sort of an inquiry at all. And\nhis death will make everything we do here look like a fraud. Instead\nof paying our Pied Piper--and great jumping Jehosophat, look at his\nname! They were rubbing our noses in it all the time! Nevertheless, we\ndidn't pay the piper; we killed him. And 'platelets Rh VI' won't be an\nadequate excuse for the press, or for Hamelin's following.\"\n\n\"It doesn't worry me,\" Mudgett rumbled. \"Who'll know? He won't die in\nour labs. He'll leave here hale and hearty. He won't die until he makes\na break for the surface. After that we can compose a fine obituary\nfor the press. Heroic government official, on the highest policy\nlevel--couldn't wait to lead his followers to the surface--died of\nbeing too much in a hurry--Re-Ed Project sorrowfully reminds everyone\nthat no technique is fool-proof--\"\n\nMudgett paused long enough to light a cigarette, which was a most\nsingular action for a man who never smoked. \"As a matter of fact,\nCarson,\" he said, \"it's a natural.\"\n\nCarson considered it. It seemed to hold up. And 'Hamelin' would have a\ndeath certificate as complex as he deserved--not officially, of course,\nbut in the minds of everyone who knew the facts. His death, when it\ncame, would be due directly to the thrombocytopenia which had caused\nthe Re-Ed machine to reject him--and thrombocytopenia is a disease of\ninfants. _Unless ye become as little children...._\n\nThat was a fitting reason for rejection from the new kingdom of Earth:\nanemia of the newborn.\n\nHis pent breath went out of him in a long sigh. He hadn't been aware\nthat he'd been holding it. \"It's true,\" he said softly. \"That's the\ntime to pay the piper.\"\n\n\"When?\" Mudgett said.\n\n\"When?\" Carson said, surprised. \"Why, _before_ he takes the children\naway.\"",
