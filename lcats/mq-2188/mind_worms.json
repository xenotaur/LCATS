    "body": "The ambassador, whose smile had grown fixed, whose thin, broad-domed\nface was lined and tired, bowed before the screen saying, \"Thank\nyou--thank you.\"\n\nOn Earth, 26,000,000 miles away, a billion saw his final bow and\ncheered him. \"Luck! Luck! Luck!\" they roared.\n\nHis screen in his suite on the space ship _Ceres_ finally went blank\nand the voice of the ship's operator cut in nervously, \"I'll j-jibe\nwith the Center Room beam in a moment, sir.\" The operator, a capable\nman, was frightened. The Ambassador had more reason to be frightened;\nhe took the moment in which he was unlinked from Earth to wipe one hand\nnervously down across his face.\n\n\"On C-Center Room, Ambass--\"\n\nThe operator at either end was cut off as the tight official beams met\nin mid space. A different voice, older and deep bass, said, \"Relax,\nPhil.\" The Ambassador let his silvery cloak fall from its dramatic\nsweep about his shoulders and stood naturally, tall, a little stooped,\nheavy-shouldered, greying in the prime of his life at seventy-five.\nHis screen, which had been flashing to him a montage of the crowds in\nTimes Square, in Trafalgar Square, in the Champ de Mars, in Red Square,\nfilled with a view of Center Room, from which the Earth was governed.\n\nThe bass voice, backed by a large and friendly smile, belonged to the\nPresident, who sat at the head of the great ivory table in the huge,\nsoft-lit room. They all were there, the men whom custom deprived of\na name when it gave them their titles--the Executive Secretary, the\nCoordinator for Education, the Coordinator for Energy, the Terrestrial\nand Astral Coordinators for Commerce and the half-dozen others who\npossessed the ten-year term. If, privately, they called each other\nGeorge and Ahmed and Sven, it was for relaxation from the standard of\ndignity expected of them.\n\nAt the foot of the table sat a small group of important guests, and\nall the white, black, yellow and brown faces were turned to the image\nof the Ambassador who waited for permission from the Venusians to step\nupon Venus.\n\n\"Take it easy, Phil,\" the President said.\n\nThe Ambassador forced a smile. \"Alec, when it's all over, I will.\"\n\n\"It can't fail. The very fact that after fifty years of trying they're\nfinally willing to receive an Earthman and will consider trade--\"\nThe President made, a large, gathering gesture: _Everything's in the\nforce-field_. \"For fifty years,\" he said with the reassurance the\nAmbassador so greatly needed, \"we've been dropping them capsules of\nEarth goods and the means to learn our language. Drop, drop, drop, and\nwe've worn away the stone. Can't fail, Phil.\"\n\n\"I know,\" the Ambassador said. He thought: It isn't that. It was the\ntriple-distilled inferiority complex which gripped him and shook him.\nThe dread of the terrible brains below Venus' mist.\n\nOne by one around the table they gave him brief, friendly God-speed.\nThe distinguished guests were properly more formal with, \"The Assembled\nPhysicists have asked me to convey to you all our best wishes,\nAmbassador,\" and more on that style. He thanked them gravely.\n\n\n\nOne guest, however, distinctly annoyed him. It was Rupert Hoag, the\nlast of the pioneers, that walking fossil from the first days of\nspace travel. \"Wide-open, Ambassador,\" he creaked with an antiquarian\nreference to atom-jets and a wave of his one hand that was not formal\nat all. Otherwise crippled from long-ago radiations was Hoag, but at\na hundred and forty his one eye was bright. Probably he had not been\ninvited to the gathering but just had barged in, being one of the\nhalf-dozen holders of High Privilege, that peculiar, all-inclusive\nreward for distinguished service. The trouble with Hoag was that he\nnever would confine himself, like a decent old-timer, to remarking on\nthe progress his years had seen.\n\nThis official farewell had a purpose. The men on Earth, secure and\nsane, were trying to give one last tenuous thread of security to the\nvery sane, very well-adjusted (on Earth) Ambassador who in space was\nready for a mental crack-up. No psychiatry or long-distance hypnosis\nhad yet prevailed against the rampant inferiority, the primitive and\ninfantile desire to crawl and hide which came often to Earthmen in the\npresence of alien, superior races. A foreigner who came to Earth they\ncould respect and that was all; a foreigner met after a trip through\nspace they met with their every fear and complex laid naked perhaps by\nartificial gravity, by unknown rays--by something.\n\nLampell, the first to make contact with the first unworldly race--Good\nLord, Lampell actually had been a contemporary of leering old Hoag,\nthere!--had met on Mars a cynical bunch of mental wizards who had had,\nand still had the most unholy good time with the bumbling Earthmen who\nwould dare anything for trade. Of Lampell's crew, twelve out of forty\nreturned sane, half-dead but sane, and the twelve did not include\nLampell, first to set foot on Mars. That had been eighty years ago.\nTwo other cultures were discovered in the next thirty years, those on\nJupiter and upon Saturn's moon Phoebe. Always, the first few to expose\ntheir naked, terrified minds to a cosmic sophistication met the same\nfate. There was an old saying which the Ambassador now remembered a\nlittle too clearly:\n\n_Crazy as an ambassador...._\n\nThe Ambassador jerked his hand away from his face. But all in Center\nRoom had seen the desperate gesture, made as though one could wipe away\nfear.\n\n\"Say, Ambassador.\" That was old Hoag. \"Say, Ambassador, I've been\nsaving up something to tell you.\"\n\nAnnoyance ran around the ivory table. But High Privilege was High\nPrivilege. All Hoag had to tell the public was that the Ten-year men\nhadn't been polite to him--\n\n\"Say, Ambassador, you know, I had a funny experience once, my first\ntrip to Phoebe. Was the second trip made there, by the way. Mighty\nfunny experience and it wasn't ever made public, because you know how\nthings were.\" The old man chuckled rustily. \"Nobody wanted to say\nanything against space travel until all the stock was sold. But I've\nbeen saving it up for a time just like this, to tell an Ambassador\nwho's on a spot. Been saving up--\" Hoag's mind seemed to skip, and\nhe banged the table, laughing. \"Yes sir, that was years before the\nPhoebean platinum scandal, and what Rupert Hoag ever had to do with\nthat scandal, I'm _not_ saying!\"\n\nThe Ambassador said pointedly, \"I understand that you were rather\nfortunate upon Phoebe, Captain Hoag.\" His voice was unsteady with\nanger. The President signalled across space, anxiously, that he should\nplease be patient.\n\nHoag, still laughing and shaking his bald, scarred head reminiscently,\nsettled back in his chair of little tension-bubbles. \"Take a load off\nyour feet, Ambassador, and listen. Wish I could give you a cigar.\"\n\nThe Ambassador took a load off his feet while the old man lit up in\ngreat comfort. As well, the Ambassador thought, to bore himself with\nHoag while waiting for a Venusian signal as to pace about with jangling\nnerves. Soothing music, escapist motion pictures he could not listen to\nor look at, not in the grip of inferiority and fear.\n\n\n\nHoag blew a smoke ring. \"Those days, a space ship didn't go much faster\nthan that ring compared to nowadays. You know how we had to do when we\nheaded for an outside planet? Took off in the direction of the Earth's\nrevolution so our speed would be greater than Earth's and we'd tend to\nspiral away from the Sun, and we'd have to take a gravity-pull off a\nplanet here and a gravity-pull off a planet there to detour us wherever\nwe wanted to go. Many's the ship missed connections, or with the metal\nof those days she blew her tubes away and she's out there yet in an\norbit, just a coffin. Or those that first tried for Venus but went into\nthe Sun ... a lot of good friends of mine, Ambassador.\" The old man\nstared bleakly ahead of him for a moment.\n\n\"And of course there was just the radar that never could follow you\nmuch beyond five million miles. I was the first one to circle the Moon,\ny'know,\" he put in with senile pride. \"Repaired a jet in mid-course. My\nhand came off a month later.\n\n\"But, as I was saying, this was on the way to Phoebe, and about a month\nout....\"\n\nThe old man finally dug into his story and as he warmed up to it so\ndid his listeners, although with a kind of self-apology for being\ninterested in one of those gaudy old adventure yarns of the times when\nthe long ships had to stand on their tails to blast off the Earth.\nThey'd wobble up on polymerized liquid fuel, not daring to start the\natom-blast till they were well beyond the atmosphere, then jerk away\nat the heads of their beautiful, wasteful fiery trains. Even the early\natom-drive required conservation, so that it was necessary to take\nthose long leap-frog curves from gravity-field to gravity-field, during\nwhich, as the ship coasted, its blast-eroded tube liners could be\nreplaced.\n\nThe _Lone Star_, Hoag's ship--he was an unregenerate Texan--had to cut\nher drive on one of these occasions. A number of her crew, in shielded\nclumsy space suits, were at work at the stern upon those terrifically\nradio-active liners while they hoped for the best. Her primitive\nscreens picked up some approaching objects and in a little while the\ngreat worms, almost as long as the 500-foot ship, faintly glowing, swam\ninto plain view against the backdrop of illimitable stars.\n\n\"Worms,\" Hoag repeated, waving his cigar. \"Space-worms.\"\n\nThey were perhaps ten times as long as they were thick, blunt-ended,\nwith a cluster of tentacles at each end and another cluster belting\nthem in the middle, all the tentacles gently moving and apparently\npropelling them. They were covered, including the tentacles, with a\ncrystalline shell that had no visible opening, but there was an eye\nthat swam under this shell anywhere along the body. What metabolic\nprocess they sustained in space could not be said. It probably was\nsimilar to that of the solar nautilus which floats in great colonies,\npaper shelled, on the pressure of light inside the orbit of Mercury,\neach colony like one vast resentful brain.\n\nThere were six of these worms. They gyrated in peculiar patterns,\nat one time joining their bodies to form a gigantic hoop around the\nship. Different radiation patterns were made evident upon the ship's\ndials, and it was obvious that these vermiform beings were trying to\ncommunicate. Neither Hoag nor his two interpreters could make anything\nof the radiation patterns, and one of the interpreters, after trying\nhard, sat blindly in a corner and shivered.\n\nInferiority complex. Or that for a beginning while alien minds strove\nimpatiently to penetrate the naked and shivering Earth minds. This was\nspace, and worse it was space in the old times before warp-vibrant\ncommunication, before rattled Earthmen could scream to a home base for\nmoral support.\n\nThe crew was still out there at the tubes when those worms came along,\nand before they could crawl or jet their way to the airlock, one of the\nworms plucked up a crew member. It was Able-bodied Spaceman Kroner, as\ncapable and steady and fearless a man who ever had boarded the _Lone\nStar_. Kroner was seen at first to go rigid while the worm held him\nwith two tentacles and looked him over with that submerged, swimming\neye.\n\nSuddenly Kroner blasted his oxygen-alcohol shoulder jets. The worm let\nhim go and recoiled.\n\n\n\nKroner slammed away into space, into nothingness. Suddenly, almost\nat the half-limit of his short supply of fuel, he turned on his own\naxis. He was expert, this Kroner, and had flipped his jet control so\nperfectly that he had turned a hundred and eighty degrees and for a\ncouple of seconds he kept going directly backward on momentum against\nthe jets' renewed forward blast. While that happened he jerked his arms\nand legs in a wild, running motion, running as though forward while\nstill going backward. It was a comic thing to see.\n\nBut at the instant of equilibrium between forward motion and backward\nmotion, those in the _Lone Star's_ control compartment caught Kroner's\nface at a high magnification upon the screen.\n\n\"He'd been frightened mad,\" Hoag said. \"We didn't need any doctor to\ntell us. We saw his face. And what he was shrieking all that time was,\n'Ma--Ma--Ma--Ma--'\"\n\nHe came at _Lone Star_ like a meteor, his arms outstretched as though\nrunning to the safety of maternal arms, and he hit the space ship so\nhard that he started a seam in her outer skin. Whether he was killed\nby the impact or by the rupture of his suit was a rhetorical question.\nThe man's body exploded outward in frozen streamers through the rents\nin the suit. The space worm plucked him up, examined him, casually tore\nthe broken suit and the corpse into pieces....\n\nAnd, in the control compartment, the Second Officer began to scream and\nto hide, forcing his way into an impossible recess behind a switchboard.\n\nInferiority complex. That, the helpless psychologists always said, was\nat the root of the madness when space travelers' primitive fears and\nemotions were lashed up by the whip of space. Lampell, long ago, seemed\nto have brought back a virus from some planet, an endemic disease\nthat took control of all but the most hearty when confronted by new,\nterrible, intelligent life forms.\n\n\"It was the cold knowingness of those worms,\" Hoag said reflectively.\n\"It was the feeling that you were licked before you started. I felt\nthe complex, and I had a terrible desire to escape my death. The only\nrefuge for my mind, from those merciless minds, was in death. If I\nhadn't been a captain, with responsibility such an instinct within me,\nmaybe I would have picked up a gun ... but I didn't.\"\n\nHe forced himself to try to communicate. There was radio and radar\nand the first model of the beam. They ignored them all. And finally,\nwith an effort of will against the fear which literally sickened him,\nhe put on a suit and went out upon the shell of _Lone Star_ with a\npaint-spray. The worms watched while he painted for them that ancient,\nuniversal mathematical proposition, _The sum of the squares of the\nsides equals the square of the hypotenuse_.\n\nThey looked, with their horrible eyes. And finally, all together, they\nturned away in unmistakable disgust.\n\nThey began to build a little solar system.\n\nOf nothingness they fashioned the black spheres--flipped them into\nshape with complicated motions of their tentacles. Nine they made,\nand set them in space with an approximation of the distances between\nthe planetary orbits. It was the same kind of approximation which is\nnecessary in any model of the solar system, for no model in which the\nplanets are of recognizable size can cope, in scale, with inter-orbital\ndistances.\n\nFinally the worms grouped themselves in the center of all, merging\ntheir body glow into a fair replica of the sun. And all the eyes\nwatched the space ship while they waited for the stupid little beings\nwithin to understand.\n\n\"Couldn't reach our poor minds with their vibrations, so they gave\nus something solid to look at. What did it mean? That they were the\narchitects of the solar system? Some of my crew were screaming we had\nmet God. All I knew was that we had to get out of there while a few\nof us were sane. Finally I drove a work gang outside to the tubes\nagain, leading them myself, and we got to work on the liners, trying\nnot to look at the worms and their solar system but feeling their eyes\nand feeling their awful, overpowering intelligence right through our\nsuits....\"\n\nA buzzer cut in, not upon the tight beam but upon the _Ceres'_\ncommunicator.\n\n\"Excuse me, Captain Hoag,\" the Ambassador said acidly. \"There is word\nfrom Venus: It seems I have _business_ to attend to.\"\n\nThe old man, back on Earth, paused, and the President said, \"We'll stay\non beam, Phil, till you go.\"\n\n\"Say, wait a minute,\" Hoag said anxiously. \"I didn't get to the point\nof the story.\"\n\nBut the Ambassador had walked out of the room.\n\nHe met the _Ceres'_ captain hurrying toward him, white-faced. Infected\nby the man's haste and half-hysterical injunction to waste no time, he\nalmost ran to the special communications compartment.\n\n\n\nHere, in a screen whose outside viewer pointed downward, he saw the\nsmooth, liquid-seeming blanket of Venusian grey clouds, weirdly touched\nwith iridescence by a blinding sun. The clouds, believed to be over a\nhundred miles thick, blanketed the entire planet. They might contain\nwater and oxygen somewhere below; here, where they touched space,\nthey were metallic vapor charged so heavily that no beam could ever\npenetrate them. The Martians, who awesomely never lied, had told\nEarthmen that Venusians existed; told them contemptuously. It would\nnot be wise to attempt a landing upon Venus without permission, the\nMartians had said. Not wise for Earthmen, at any rate.\n\nBecause of the peculiar vapor there never had been electronic or\nwarp communication with Venus. So far, the only message from below\nthose clouds had come a month before to one of the patiently waiting,\npatiently capsule-dropping ships--the permission to land one unarmed\nambassador. The Ambassador saw now that communication this time had\nbeen by the same means. A rocket had come up through the clouds,\ntrailing a wire, and had been caught in the great cable net extended\nbehind the space ship.\n\n\"I had the wire plugged immediately,\" the sweating captain said.\n\"Expected to tell them to wait a minute and I'd put the Ambassador on.\nBut they're not listening to us, just telling us. And there's a time\nlimit. I would have had a line run to your suite if I'd known there was\na time limit, but I should have known there'd be a time limit, I should\nhave known how they act, all these races, because we're so feeble and\nstupid compared--\"\n\nThe man almost was gibbering. The Ambassador slapped his shoulder\nheavily and stopped him. The Ambassador wanted a slap himself and his\nhand missed the first time as he reached for the loud-speaker stud.\n\nThe voice came instantly, so mechanical and uninflected that it\noccurred to him that a machine had spoken into a recording machine. The\nVenusians must be so unearthly as to be unable to manage Earth sounds,\nif they made sounds at all.\n\n\"... authority will advise him on the question of trade with Earth. He\nwill be freed one hour thereafter. Your ship must remain in the same\nposition meanwhile. The ambassador from Earth will leave your ship in\nprecisely eighteen minutes proceeding directly downward. He will be\npicked up by our ship within the clouds. In this ship a representative\nof fifth authority will advise him on the question of trade with Earth.\nHe will be freed one hour thereafter. Your ship must remain in the\nsame position meanwhile. The ambassador from Earth will leave your\nship in precisely eighteen minutes proceeding directly--\"\n\nThe Ambassador snapped the stud, his teeth gritted hard against a\ntrembling. He was not even to land upon the alien planet, then. Not\neven to talk to the head of government but with \"a representative of\nfifth authority.\" It was so condescending, so contemptuous--and so\ndeserved, of course, he thought, staring at the captain who stared\nwild-eyed. You wanted to run. You wanted to hide. Already you felt\nthem inside your mind ruthlessly peering, destroying. _As crazy as an\nambassador._\n\nContemptuous time limit of eighteen minutes! They'd been told that it\ntook a minimum of sixteen minutes to get into a space suit.\n\n\"My suit! The dressers!\" shouted the Ambassador. Remembering the\nTen-year men who waited to reassure him, and badly needing one last\ncontact--\"Bring everything to the Earth screen!\"\n\nAs he fled the room he saw, in the screen which showed Venus, a vast\nsilvery ovoid lift momentarily to the surface of the vapor, then sink\nslightly and remain in a suggestion of menace neither in sight nor out\nof sight, waiting to engulf him.\n\n\n\nWhen he faced the Earth screen two expert dressers flung themselves\nupon him with the pneumatic pads whose donning before the space suit\ntook care and time. In Center Room, all the perfectly sane, shielded\nmen attempted to convey by smiles their confidence in the shuddering\ncreature being lapped in weirdness. The Ambassador strove with all his\nconsiderable mental power to hold the impression of those reassuring\nsmiles.\n\nAnd that doddering fool, Hoag, with his one arm waving unwanted\nfriendliness, said, \"Ahoy Ambassador! Now we can get to the point of\nthat story.\"\n\nA story about superior merciless beings, calculated to break the last\nweak thread of a man's confidence! \"Shut up!\" the Ambassador wanted to\nscream across space. And would have, had not the dressers jammed his\nmouth closed, at that moment, as they adjusted a throat pad.\n\nOn Earth, too, they tried to shut up Hoag but they couldn't. \"I'm not\nthe old fool you think I am,\" he said. \"Listen! Ambassador--gentlemen,\nHigh Privilege!--Ambassador,\" he said urgently, \"I told you I've been\nsaving this story to tell an Ambassador at the last minute when he's in\nthe spot you're in. I've been waiting fifty years. Listen!\n\n\"The vermiforms made this little solar system and we didn't understand,\ncouldn't understand. We got our liners replaced finally and no more\nthan half of us were capable of standing a watch when we blasted off.\nAmbassador, we blasted the hell out of there!\n\n\"The vermiforms stayed where they were for a few seconds. Then they\nbegan to follow. We were streaming a good train, of course, the old\nfission train, a couple of miles of very fancy destruction and waste.\nSo the worms came along. They overtook us easy. And they began to dance\nin and out of our train.\n\n\"Yes sir, Ambassador, they weaved and they circled in and out of that\nawful atom-blast. And I knew that the atom-blast will kill anything,\nchop through any armor. But not those worms! _Now_ they showed us how\nsuperior they were! _Now_ they made fun of our power!\n\n\"And I wanted to run and hide where my officer was hiding down among\nthe mattresses we rigged for him among the girders along the keel. My\nmind was scarred by space and by everything that Earthmen were not born\nto--\n\n\"And then it happened.\"\n\nAdjustments now had been made and the Ambassador could speak while the\ndressers almost threw him into the inner suit. His hand clawed his face\nand he said hoarsely, \"For God's sake man, spare me!\"\n\n\"And then it happened!\" old Hoag shouted, thrusting away from those in\nthe Center Room who were now trying physically to shut him up. \"The\nworms died! They died in the atom-blast!\"\n\nThe Ambassador stared, and around the ivory table they stared at the\nlast of the pioneers.\n\n\"Died! The vermiforms' natural armor was proof against all the rays of\nspace and it held out against the atom-blast for a quarter of minute.\nBut then it went. One after the other they went limp and the blast\nspewed them backward and we could see the spreading holes in them. And\nthen they were out of sight, dead, killed because they hadn't known\nany better, by George!\n\n\"And we went on to Phoebe and got along better than anyone else with\nthe things that sit inside their crystals, thinking. Got the platinum\nnobody else could take. Because we knew that the universe can breed\nmorons, incompetents! The crystal people are smarter than Earthmen,\nsure. But at least we knew we were smarter than somebody else!\n\n\"Don't you see, Ambassador,\" the old man said earnestly, \"that only the\ninferiority complex kept us from knowing right away that those worms\nwere no better than children? They hadn't been trying to send us any\nmessage with radiations. No, it had been only the natural radiations of\ntheir bodies, changing as they changed their formations around us--as\nthey _played_. One of them picked up poor Kroner. Why not? The thing\nwas curious. Took him apart, later, the way a child will take apart a\ntoy. My business with the square on the hypotenuse? Hell, how could\nthey understand when they'd never learned any mathematics?\"\n\n\"How could they?\" the Ambassador echoed, and he was smiling.\n\n\"And that little trick of theirs, making a solar system. Well, don't\nyou see that they had to show off? One of their natural functions is\nsimply gathering and stacking together the scattered atoms of space.\nI'll bet they can't make anything but black balls of amorphous matter.\nIt's possible they build themselves a little world here and there to\nlay their eggs on, or something. So, there they were feeling kind of\nabashed because they had no space ship or anything, so they just had to\nshow us what they could do, and that they actually had gone and counted\nthe planets of this system--on their tentacles, I'll bet, since they\nhad more than nine tentacles. And wasn't it childish, getting together\nin the middle to show us a nice, glowing sun?\"\n\n\n\nThey were locking the thorax section on the Ambassador. He stood\nstraight and silent. Very straight.\n\n\"Ambassador,\" the old man pleaded over thirty million miles, \"you\ndon't _know_ what you're going to meet on Venus. You don't _know_\nthat they're particularly smart. And they don't know about you. Maybe\nthey're a little afraid of you. Maybe they're a _lot_ afraid of you. We\ndon't know one way. But we don't know the other.\n\n\"But you know now, the best way and the best minute I can tell you,\nthat some pretty dumb creatures live beyond Earth. Now, the way my\ngrandfather's grandfather used to say, you wouldn't start selling your\nhorse to a stranger by telling him that your horse is no good?\"\n\nSilence, then, on the beam from Earth to Venus.\n\nThe dressers began to lower the helmet over the Ambassador's head. He\nstopped them. \"Wait a minute.\"\n\nStill that nakedness in his mind, and the fear ready to pounce again.\nBut that was only an effect of space, not Venusians. Or was it simply\nLampell's heritage. A conditioning?\n\nAnd that contemptuous message, with its almost-impossible time limit\nand its pointed refusal to allow him to set foot upon Venus and its\n\"representative of the fifth authority.\" He didn't know one way and\nhe didn't know the other, but it could be a defense mechanism on the\nVenusians' part.\n\nIn Center Room an old, old man had slumped in his chair, exhausted,\nreduced to crippled flesh that bore one bright, brave Earthman's eye.\nThe Ambassador waved. The old-timer waved back eagerly.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the Ambassador formally, but he spoke to the one\nadventurer, \"I thought I was in a hurry but I've decided I've plenty of\ntime. I think it will be a very good idea to open these negotiations by\nkeeping the other party waiting.\"",
