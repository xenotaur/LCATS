    "body": "1909\n\n\n\nPRIZE MONEY\n\n\nThe old man stood by the window, gazing at the frozen fields beyond.  The\nsign of the Cauliflower was stiff with snow, and the breath of a pair of\nwaiting horses in a wagon beneath ascended in clouds of steam.\n\n\"Amusements\" he said slowly, as he came back with a shiver and, resuming\nhis seat by the tap-room fire, looked at the wayfarer who had been idly\nquestioning him.  \"Claybury men don't have much time for amusements.\nThe last one I can call to mind was Bill Chambers being nailed up in a\npig-sty he was cleaning out, but there was such a fuss made over that\n--by Bill--that it sort o' disheartened people.\"\n\nHe got up again restlessly, and, walking round the table, gazed long and\nhard into three or four mugs.\n\n\"Sometimes a little gets left in them,\" he explained, meeting the\nstranger's inquiring glance.  The latter started, and, knocking on the\ntable with the handle of his knife, explained that he had been informed\nby a man outside that his companion was the bitterest teetotaller in\nClaybury.\n\n\"That's one o' Bob Pretty's larks,\" said the old man, flushing.  \"I see\nyou talking to 'im, and I thought as 'ow he warn't up to no good.\nBiggest rascal in Claybury, he is.  I've said so afore, and I'll say so\nagin.\"\n\nHe bowed to the donor and buried his old face in the mug.\n\n\"A poacher!\" he said, taking breath.  \"A thief!\"  he continued, after\nanother draught.  \"I wonder whether Smith spilt any of this a-carrying of\nit in?\"\n\nHe put down the empty mug and made a careful examination of the floor,\nuntil a musical rapping on the table brought the landlord into the room\nagain.\n\n\"My best respects,\" he said, gratefully, as he placed the mug on the\nsettle by his side and slowly filled a long clay pipe.  Next time you see\nBob Pretty ask 'im wot happened to the prize hamper.  He's done a good\nmany things has Bob, but it'll be a long time afore Claybury men'll look\nover that.\n\nIt was Henery Walker's idea.  Henery 'ad been away to see an uncle of 'is\nwife's wot had money and nobody to leave it to--leastways, so Henery\nthought when he wasted his money going over to see 'im--and he came back\nfull of the idea, which he 'ad picked up from the old man.\n\n\"We each pay twopence a week till Christmas,\" he ses, \"and we buy a\nhamper with a goose or a turkey in it, and bottles o' rum and whiskey and\ngin, as far as the money'll go, and then we all draw lots for it, and the\none that wins has it.\"\n\nIt took a lot of explaining to some of 'em, but Smith, the landlord,\nhelped Henery, and in less than four days twenty-three men had paid their\ntuppences to Henery, who 'ad been made the seckitary, and told him to\nhand them over to Smith in case he lost his memory.\n\nBob Pretty joined one arternoon on the quiet, and more than one of 'em\ntalked of 'aving their money back, but, arter Smith 'ad explained as 'ow\nhe would see fair play, they thought better of it.\n\n\"He'll 'ave the same chance as all of you,\" he ses.  \"No more and no\nless.\"\n\n\"I'd feel more easy in my mind, though, if'e wasn't in it,\" ses Bill\nChambers, staring at Bob.  \"I never knew 'im to lose anything yet.\"\n\n\"You don't know everything, Bill,\" ses Bob, shaking his 'ead.  \"You don't\nknow me; else you wouldn't talk like that.  I've never been caught doing\nwrong yet, and I 'ope I never shall.\"\n\n\"It's all right, Bill,\" ses George Kettle.  \"Mr. Smith'll see fair, and\nI'd sooner win Bob Pretty's money than anybody's.\"\n\n\"I 'ope you will, mate,\" ses Bob; \"that's what I joined for.\"\n\n\"Bob's money is as good as anybody else's,\" ses George Kettle, looking\nround at the others.  \"It don't signify to me where he got it from.\"\n\n\"Ah, I don't like to hear you talk like that George,\" ses Bob Pretty.\n\"I've thought more than once that you 'ad them ideas.\"\n\nHe drank up his beer and went off 'ome, shaking his 'cad, and, arter\nthree or four of'em 'ad explained to George Kettle wot he meant, George\nwent off 'ome, too.\n\nThe week afore Christmas, Smith, the landlord, said as 'ow he 'ad got\nenough money, and three days arter we all came up 'ere to see the prize\ndrawn.  It was one o' the biggest hampers Smith could get; and there was\na fine, large turkey in it, a large goose, three pounds o' pork sausages,\na bottle o' whiskey, a bottle o' rum, a bottle o' brandy, a bottle o'\ngin, and two bottles o' wine.  The hamper was all decorated with holly,\nand a little flag was stuck in the top.\n\nOn'y men as belonged was allowed to feel the turkey and the goose, and\narter a time Smith said as 'ow p'r'aps they'd better leave off, and 'e\nput all the things back in the hamper and fastened up the lid.\n\n\"How are we going to draw the lottery?\" ses John Biggs, the blacksmith.\n\n\"There'll be twenty-three bits o' paper,\" ses Smith, \"and they'll be\nnumbered from one to twenty-three.  Then they'll be twisted up all the\nsame shape and put in this 'ere paper bag, which I shall 'old as each man\ndraws.  The chap that draws the paper with the figger on it wins.\"\n\nHe tore up twenty-three bits o' paper all about the same size, and then\nwith a black-lead pencil 'e put the numbers on, while everybody leaned\nover 'im to see fair play.  Then he twisted every bit o' paper up and\nheld them in his 'and.\n\n\"Is that satisfactory?\" he ses.\n\n\"Couldn't be fairer,\" ses Bill Chambers.\n\n\"Mind,\" ses Smith, putting them into a tall paper bag that had 'ad sugar\nin it and shaking them up, \"Number I wins the prize.  Who's going to draw\nfust?\"\n\nAll of 'em hung back and looked at each other; they all seemed to think\nthey'd 'ave a better chance when there wasn't so many numbers left in the\nbag.\n\n\"Come on,\" ses Smith, the landlord.  \"Some-body must be fust.\"\n\n\"Go on, George Kettle,\" ses Bob Pretty.  \"You're sure to win.  I 'ad a\ndream you did.\"\n\n\"Go on yourself,\" ses George.\n\n\"I never 'ave no luck,\" ses Bob; \"but if Henery Walker will draw fust,\nI'll draw second.  Somebody must begin.\"\n\n\"O' course they must,\" ses Henery, \"and if you're so anxious why don't\nyou 'ave fust try?\"\n\nBob Pretty tried to laugh it off, but they wouldn't 'ave it, and at last\nhe takes out a pocket-'andkerchief and offers it to Smith, the landlord.\n\n\"All right, I'll go fust if you'll blindfold me,\" he ses.\n\n\"There ain't no need for that, Bob,\" ses Mr. Smith.  \"You can't see in\nthe bag, and even if you could it wouldn't help you.\"\n\n\"Never mind; you blindfold me,\" ses Bob; \"it'll set a good example to the\nothers.\"\n\nSmith did it at last, and when Bob Pretty put his 'and in the bag and\npulled out a paper you might ha' heard a pin drop.\n\n\"Open it and see what number it is, Mr. Smith,\" ses Bob Pretty.  \"Twenty-\nthree, I expect; I never 'ave no luck.\"\n\nSmith rolled out the paper, and then 'e turned pale and 'is eyes seemed\nto stick right out of his 'ead.\n\n\"He's won it!\"  he ses, in a choky voice.  \"It's Number I.  Bob Pretty\n'as won the prize.\"\n\nYou never 'eard such a noise in this 'ere public-'ouse afore or since;\neverybody shouting their 'ardest, and Bill Chambers stamping up and down\nthe room as if he'd gone right out of his mind.\n\n\"Silence!\" ses Mr. Smith, at last.  \"Silence!  How dare you make that\nnoise in my 'ouse, giving it a bad name?  Bob Pretty 'as won it fair and\nsquare.  Nothing could ha' been fairer.  You ought to be ashamed o'\nyourselves.\"\n\nBob Pretty wouldn't believe it at fust.  He said that Smith was making\ngame of 'im, and, when Smith held the paper under 'is nose, he kept the\nhandkerchief on his eyes and wouldn't look at it.\n\n\"I've seen you afore to-day,\" he says, nodding his 'ead.  \"I like a joke\nas well as anybody, but it ain't fair to try and make fun of a pore,\n'ard-working man like that.\"\n\nI never see a man so astonished in my life as Bob Pretty was, when 'e\nfound out it was really true.  He seemed fair 'mazed-like, and stood\nthere scratching his 'ead, as if he didn't know where 'e was.  He come\nround at last, arter a pint o' beer that Smith 'ad stood 'im, and then he\nmade a little speech, thanking Smith for the fair way he 'ad acted, and\ntook up the hamper.\n\n\"'Strewth, it is heavy,\" he ses, getting it up on his back.  \"Well, so\nlong, mates.\"\n\n\"Ain't you--ain't you going to stand us a drink out o' one o' them\nbottles?\" ses Peter Gubbins, as Bob got to the door.\n\nBob Pretty went out as if he didn't 'ear; then he stopped, sudden-like,\nand turned round and put his 'ead in at the door agin, and stood looking\nat 'em.\n\n\"No, mates,\" he ses, at last, \"and I wonder at you for asking, arter what\nyou've all said about me.  I'm a pore man, but I've got my feelings.  I\ndrawed fust becos nobody else would, and all the thanks I get for it is\nto be called a thief.\"\n\nHe went off down the road, and by and by Bill Chambers, wot 'ad been\nsitting staring straight in front of 'im, got up and went to the door,\nand stood looking arter 'im like a man in a dream.  None of 'em seemed to\nbe able to believe that the lottery could be all over so soon, and Bob\nPretty going off with it, and when they did make up their minds to it, it\nwas one o' the most miserable sights you ever see.  The idea that they\n'ad been paying a pint a week for Bob Pretty for months nearly sent some\nof 'em out of their minds.\n\n\"It can't be 'elped,\" ses Mr. Smith.  \"He 'ad the pluck to draw fust, and\nhe won; anybody else might ha' done it.  He gave you the offer, George\nKettle, and you, too, Henery Walker.\"\n\nHenery Walker was too low-spirited to answer 'im; and arter Smith 'ad\nsaid \"Hush!\"  to George Kettle three times, he up and put 'im outside for\nthe sake of the 'ouse.\n\nWhen 'e came back it was all quiet and everybody was staring their\n'ardest at little Dicky Weed, the tailor, who was sitting with his head\nin his 'ands, thinking, and every now and then taking them away and\nlooking up at the ceiling, or else leaning forward with a start and\nlooking as if 'e saw something crawling on the wall.\n\n\"Wot's the matter with you?\"  ses Mr. Smith.\n\nDicky Weed didn't answer 'im.  He shut his eyes tight and then 'e jumps\nup all of a sudden.  \"I've got it!\" he says.  \"Where's that bag?\"\n\n\"Wot bag?\" ses Mr. Smith, staring at 'im.  \"The bag with the papers in,\"\nses Dicky.\n\n\"Where Bob Pretty ought to be,\" ses Bill Chambers.  \"On the fire.\"\n\n\"Wot?\" screams Dicky Weed.  \"Now you've been and spoilt everything!\"\n\n\"Speak English,\" ses Bill.\n\n\"I will!\" ses Dicky, trembling all over with temper.  \"Who asked you to\nput it on the fire?  Who asked you to put yourself forward?  I see it all\nnow, and it's too late.\"\n\n\"Wot's too late?\"  ses Sam Tones.\n\n\"When Bob Pretty put his 'and in that bag,\" ses Dicky Weed, holding up\n'is finger and looking at them, \"he'd got a bit o' paper already in it--a\nbit o' paper with the figger I on it.  That's 'ow he done it.  While we\nwas all watching Mr. Smith, he was getting 'is own bit o' paper ready.\"\n\nHe 'ad to say it three times afore they understood 'im, and then they\nwent down on their knees and burnt their fingers picking up bits o' paper\nthat 'ad fallen in the fireplace.  They found six pieces in all, but not\none with the number they was looking for on it, and then they all got up\nand said wot ought to be done to Bob Pretty.\n\n\"You can't do anything,\" ses Smith, the landlord.  \"You can't prove it.\nAfter all, it's only Dicky's idea.\"\n\nArf-a-dozen of 'em all began speaking at once, but Bill Chambers gave 'em\nthe wink, and pretended to agree with 'im.\n\n\"We're going to have that hamper back,\" he ses, as soon as Mr. Smith 'ad\ngone back to the bar, \"but it won't do to let 'im know.  He don't like to\nthink that Bob Pretty was one too many for 'im.\"\n\n\"Let's all go to Bob Pretty's and take it,\" ses Peter Gubbins, wot 'ad\nbeen in the Militia.\n\nDicky Weed shook his 'ead.  \"He'd 'ave the lor on us for robbery,\" he\nses; \"there's nothing he'd like better.\"\n\nThey talked it over till closing-time, but nobody seemed to know wot to\ndo, and they stood outside in the bitter cold for over arf an hour still\ntrying to make up their minds 'ow to get that hamper back.  Fust one went\noff 'ome and then another, and at last, when there was on'y three or four\nof 'em left, Henery Walker, wot prided himself on 'is artfulness, 'ad an\nidea.\n\n\"One of us must get Bob Pretty up 'ere to-morrow night and stand 'im a\npint, or p'r'aps two pints,\" he ses.  \"While he's here two other chaps\nmust 'ave a row close by his 'ouse and pretend to fight.  Mrs. Pretty and\nthe young 'uns are sure to run out to look at it, and while they are out\nanother chap can go in quiet-like and get the hamper.\"\n\nIt seemed a wunnerful good idea, and Bill Chambers said so; and 'e\nflattered Henery Walker up until Henery didn't know where to look, as the\nsaying is.\n\n\"And wot's to be done with the hamper when we've got it?\"  ses Sam Jones.\n\n\"Have it drawed for agin,\" ses Henery.  \"It'll 'ave to be done on the\nquiet, o' course.\"\n\nSam Jones stood thinking for a bit.  \"Burn the hamper and draw lots for\neverything separate,\" 'e ses, very slow.  \"If Bob Pretty ses it's 'is\nturkey and goose and spirits, tell 'im to prove it.  We sha'n't know\nnothing about it.\"\n\nHenery Walker said it was a good plan; and arter talking it over they\nwalked 'ome all very pleased with theirselves.  They talked it over next\nday with the other chaps; and Henery Walker said arterwards that p'r'aps\nit was talked over a bit too much.\n\nIt took 'em some time to make up their minds about it, but at last it was\nsettled that Peter Gubbins was to stand Bob Pretty the beer; Ted Brown,\nwho was well known for his 'ot temper, and Joe Smith was to 'ave the\nquarrel; and Henery Walker was to slip in and steal the hamper, and 'ide\nthe things up at his place.\n\nBob Pretty fell into the trap at once.  He was standing at 'is gate in\nthe dark, next day, smoking a pipe, when Peter Gubbins passed, and Peter,\narter stopping and asking 'im for a light, spoke about 'is luck in\ngetting the hamper, and told 'im he didn't bear no malice for it.\n\n\"You 'ad the pluck to draw fust,\" he ses, \"and you won.\"\n\nBob Pretty said he was a Briton, and arter a little more talk Peter asked\n'im to go and 'ave a pint with 'im to show that there was no ill-feeling.\nThey came into this 'ere Cauliflower public-'ouse like brothers, and in\nless than ten minutes everybody was making as much fuss o' Bob Pretty as\nif 'e'd been the best man in Claybury.\n\n\"Arter all, a man can't 'elp winning a prize,\" ses Bill Chambers, looking\nround.\n\n\"I couldn't,\" ses Bob.\n\nHe sat down and 'elped hisself out o' Sam Jones's baccy-box; and one or\ntwo got up on the quiet and went outside to listen to wot was going on\ndown the road.  Everybody was wondering wot was happening, and when Bob\nPretty got up and said 'e must be going, Bill Chambers caught 'old of him\nby the coat and asked 'im to have arf a pint with 'im.\n\nBob had the arf-pint, and arter that another one with Sam Jones, and then\n'e said 'e really must be going, as his wife was expecting 'im.  He\npushed Bill Chambers's 'at over his eyes--a thing Bill can't abear--and\narter filling 'is pipe agin from Sam Jones's box he got up and went.\n\n\"Mind you,\" ses Bill Chambers, looking round, \"if 'e comes back and ses\nsomebody 'as taken his hamper, nobody knows nothing about it.\"\n\n\"I 'ope Henery Walker 'as got it all right,\" ses Dicky Weed.  \"When shall\nwe know?\"\n\n\"He'll come up 'ere and tell us,\" ses Bill Chambers.  \"It's time 'e was\nhere, a'most.\"\n\nFive minutes arterwards the door opened and Henery Walker came staggering\nin.  He was as white as a sheet, his 'at was knocked on one side of his\n'ead, and there was two or three nasty-looking scratches on 'is cheek.\nHe came straight to Bill Chambers's mug--wot 'ad just been filled--and\nemptied it, and then 'e sat down on a seat gasping for breath.\n\n\"Wots the matter, Henery?\"  ses Bill, staring at 'im with 'is mouth open.\n\nHenery Walker groaned and shook his 'ead.  \"Didn't you get the hamper?\"\nses Bill, turning pale.  Henery Walker shook his 'ead agin.\n\n\"Shut up!\" he ses, as Bill Chambers started finding fault.  \"I done the\nbest I could.  Nothing could ha' 'appened better--to start with.\nDirectly Ted Brown and Joe Smith started, Mrs. Pretty and her sister, and\nall the kids excepting the baby, run out, and they'd 'ardly gone afore I\nwas inside the back door and looking for that hamper, and I'd hardly\nstarted afore I heard them coming back agin.  I was at the foot o' the\nstairs at the time, and, not knowing wot to do, I went up 'em into Bob's\nbedroom.\"\n\n\"Well?\" ses Bill Chambers, as Henery Walker stopped and looked round.\n\n\"A'most direckly arterwards I 'eard Mrs. Pretty and her sister coming\nupstairs,\" ses Henery Walker, with a shudder.  \"I was under the bed at\nthe time, and afore I could say a word Mrs. Pretty gave a loud screech\nand scratched my face something cruel.  I thought she'd gone mad.\"\n\n\"You've made a nice mess of it!\" ses Bill Chambers.\n\n\"Mess!\" ses Henery, firing up.  \"Wot would you ha' done?\"\n\n\"I should ha' managed diff'rent,\" ses Bill Chambers.  \"Did she know who\nyou was?\"\n\n\"Know who I was?\" ses Henery.  \"O' course she did.  It's my belief that\nBob knew all about it and told 'er wot to do.\"\n\n\"Well, you've done it now, Henery,\" ses Bill Chambers.  \"Still, that's\nyour affair.\"\n\n\"Ho, is it?\" ses Henery Walker.  \"You 'ad as much to do with it as I 'ad,\nexcepting that you was sitting up 'ere in comfort while I was doing all\nthe work.  It's a wonder to me I got off as well as I did.\"\n\nBill Chambers sat staring at 'im and scratching his 'ead, and just then\nthey all 'eard the voice of Bob Pretty, very distinct, outside, asking\nfor Henery Walker.  Then the door opened, and Bob Pretty, carrying his\n'ead very 'igh, walked into the room.\n\n\"Where's Henery Walker?\" he ses, in a loud voice.\n\nHenery Walker put down the empty mug wot he'd been pretending to drink\nout of and tried to smile at 'im.\n\n\"Halloa, Bob!\" he ses.\n\n\"What was you doing in my 'ouse?\"  ses Bob Pretty, very severe.\n\n\"I--I just looked in to see whether you was in, Bob,\" ses Henery.\n\n\"That's why you was found under my bed, I s'pose?\"  ses Bob Pretty.\n\"I want a straight answer, Henery Walker, and I mean to 'ave it, else I'm\ngoing off to Cudford for Policeman White.\"\n\n\"I went there to get that hamper,\" ses Henery Walker, plucking up spirit.\n\"You won it unfair last night, and we determined for to get it back.  So\nnow you know.\"\n\n\"I call on all of you to witness that,\" ses Bob, looking round.  \"Henery\nWalker went into my 'ouse to steal my hamper.  He ses so, and it wasn't\n'is fault he couldn't find it.  I'm a pore man and I can't afford such\nthings; I sold it this morning, a bargain, for thirty bob.\"\n\n\"Well, then there's no call to make a fuss over it, Bob,\" ses Bill\nChambers.\n\n\"I sold it for thirty bob,\" ses Bob Pretty, \"and when I went out this\nevening I left the money on my bedroom mantelpiece--one pound, two\narf-crowns, two two-shilling pieces, and two sixpences.  My wife and\nher sister both saw it there.  That they'll swear to.\"\n\n\"Well, wot about it?\" ses Sam Jones, staring at 'im.\n\n\"Arter my pore wife 'ad begged and prayed Henery Walker on 'er bended\nknees to spare 'er life and go,\" ses Bob Pretty, \"she looked at the\nmantel-piece and found the money 'ad disappeared.\"\n\nHenery Walker got up all white and shaking and flung 'is arms about,\ntrying to get 'is breath.\n\n\"Do you mean to say I stole it?\" he ses, at last.\n\n\"O' course I do,\" ses Bob Pretty.  \"Why, you said yourself afore these\nwitnesses and Mr. Smith that you came to steal the hamper.  Wot's the\ndifference between stealing the hamper and the money I sold it for?\"\n\nHenery Walker tried for to answer 'im, but he couldn't speak a word.\n\n\"I left my pore wife with 'er apron over her 'ead sobbing as if her 'art\nwould break,\" ses Bob Pretty; \"not because o' the loss of the money so\nmuch, but to think of Henery Walker doing such a thing--and 'aving to go\nto jail for it.\"\n\n\"I never touched your money, and you know it,\" ses Henery Walker, finding\nhis breath at last.  I don't believe it was there.  You and your wife 'ud\nswear anything.\"\n\n\"As you please, Henery,\" ses Bob Pretty.  \"Only I'm going straight off to\nCudford to see Policeman White; he'll be glad of a job, I know.  There's\nthree of us to swear to it, and you was found under my bed.\"\n\n\"Let bygones be bygones, Bob,\" ses Bill Chambers, trying to smile at 'im.\n\n\"No, mate,\" ses Bob Pretty.  \"I'm going to 'ave my rights, but I don't\nwant to be 'ard on a man I've known all my life; and if, afore I go to my\nbed to-night, the thirty shillings is brought to me, I won't say as I\nwon't look over it.\"\n\nHe stood for a moment shaking his 'ead at them, and then, still holding\nit very 'igh, he turned round and walked out.\n\n\"He never left no money on the mantelpiece,\" ses Sam Jones, at last.\n\n\"Don't you believe it.  You go to jail, Henery.\"\n\n\"Anything sooner than be done by Bob Pretty,\" ses George Kettle.\n\n\"There's not much doing now, Henery,\" ses Bill Chambers, in a soft voice.\n\nHenery Walker wouldn't listen to 'em, and he jumped up and carried on\nlike a madman.  His idea was for 'em all to club together to pay the\nmoney, and to borrow it from Smith, the landlord, to go on with.  They\nwouldn't 'ear of it at fust, but arter Smith 'ad pointed out that they\nmight 'ave to go to jail with Henery, and said things about 'is license,\nthey gave way.  Bob Pretty was just starting off to see Policeman White\nwhen they took the money, and instead o' telling 'im wot they thought of\n'im, as they 'ad intended, Henery Walker 'ad to walk alongside of 'im and\nbeg and pray of 'im to take the money.  He took it at last as a favor to\nHenery, and bought the hamper back with it next morning--cheap.\nLeastways, he said so.",
