    "body": "\n[Sidenote: No wonder Stefanik meant to fight to the last--he wasn't\ngoing to turn his kids over to an old goat like Glinka!]\n\n\nThe seaplane cast its silhouette from aloft upon the blue Arabian Sea,\nleft its white wake across the shallows, and taxied alongside the\nancient stone jetty, clawing into the sandy bottom with its small fore\nand after anchors.\n\nColonel Glinka stepped out upon the wing, carefully measured the\ndistance to the jetty, and sprang for it, wetting himself up to the seat\nof his voluminous khaki shorts.\n\nThis lonely sandspit, these barren slopes and frowning, ocher cliffs,\nthe oceanic silence around him, broken by the plaintive cries of\nwheeling Caspian terns that were badly in need of laundering, were not,\nhe thought as he clambered ashore, exactly as one pictures a tropical\nparadise.\n\nAnd it helped the desolation of his mood not at all that upon these same\narid ridges scores of silent, burnoosed figures watched him as he stood\nthere, allowing the water to drain from his perforated white oxfords and\nall unaware that his vast pith helmet, curiously heavy malacca cane and\nformidable fundament cast a centaur's shadow upon the rocks in the later\nafternoon sun.\n\nColonel Glinka took a pair of green sun goggles from his pocket and put\nthem on, resolutely hitched up his shorts, assumed the stern yet\nconciliatory expression of a hedgehog in mating season, and set off up\nthe rocky path.\n\nAhead of him, the burnoosed ones scrambled nimbly up the slope, looking\nover their shoulders, intent upon not missing a thing, yet endeavoring\nto keep their distance. But two there had been who either had not seen\nhim arrive, or did not give a damn, for they suddenly appeared upon the\nrise before him, racing down toward the sea with very little regard for\nlife or limb.\n\n\n\nIn the lead, a brown young man in flying green turban and white duck\ntrousers appeared to be losing steadily to his pursuer, who, though\nswathed from head to food in that featureless native garb of the others,\nmight yet be identified by subtle conformations as a female.\n\nBoth of them stopped at once upon sighting Colonel Glinka in the\npathway, the female hurriedly retreating to what might be deemed a safer\ndistance, the young man standing as if petrified, with one foot upraised\nand a sun-snarl upon his mottled face, quivering at point.\n\n\"Oh, Effendi,\" he cried at last, \"if you are looking for Aden, then you\nare lost, for Aden is five hundred miles that way. And if you are\nlooking for Cairo--\"\n\n\"I am hardly ever lost,\" Colonel Glinka said, and, eying the young\nfemale, added, \"Tell me, what is the name of that rather tasteless game\nthat you are playing?\"\n\n\"No game, Effendi,\" the brown young man said. \"That one chases me every\ntime I go outside. They are worse than Tuaregs, these people.\"\n\n\"Are you not a native, then?\"\n\n\"I?\" The young man placed a hand of scorn upon his breast. \"Hadji Abdul\nHakkim ben Salazar? I am Saudi, and a Hadj besides. Say, Joe, have you\ngot an American cigarette?\"\n\n\"A great deal better than that,\" Colonel Glinka said, proffering an\nornate golden cigarette case. \"Try one of these, my boy.\"\n\nAbdul Hakkim ben Salazar took two, sniffing them suspiciously. \"They are\nvery brown,\" he said.\n\nLess critically, Colonel Glinka lighted one for himself. \"You know,\" he\nsaid, \"I was rather hoping that you might direct me to the house of a\nvery old friend of mine.\"\n\n\"What handle?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you what name he is presently affecting, but he is a\nsmall, crooked man with a heavy black beard--or, at any rate, he once\nhad such a beard. I know that he is somewhere on this island; therefore\nit will be useless for you to lie to me.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is the Sidi Doctor Stephens,\" Abdul said, puffing not too\nhappily upon his cigarette. \"His is the only house upon this island;\nalso, I am his flunky and so I ought to know.\"\n\n\"'Stephens' will do,\" said Colonel Glinka, thwacking him smartly with\nthe Malacca cane. \"Lead on. And you may dispense with the gutter\nAmerican dialect. I am not American, and besides I speak Arabic\nfluently.\"\n\n\"But I not so well,\" Abdul said, \"for I was raised in the Kuwait\noil-fields.\"\n\n\"By whom? A camel breeder?\"\n\n\"Socony Vacuum,\" Abdul said.\n\nThey toiled up the face of the cliff. At once, half a dozen of the\nwhite-robed gallery fell in behind them. When Colonel Glinka stopped and\nlooked back, they stopped. When he continued upon his way, they\ncontinued.\n\n\"Have they no homes to which to go?\" he complained. \"Have they nothing\nto do?\"\n\n\"They are a very backward people, who live in the open,\" Abdul said.\n\"They do not work.\"\n\n\"How, then, do the wretches live? Wall Street charity, I presume.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, when they are not able to forage, the Sidi Doctor Stephens\nfeeds them.\"\n\n\"The reactionary old fool! But you may be sure that they knew how to\nwork in the old days, before he came.\"\n\n\"I do not think so.\"\n\n\"And why, in your ageless wisdom, not?\"\n\n\"Because the Sidi Doctor made them,\" Abdul Hakkim ben Salazar said.\n\n\n\nColonel Glinka did not reply, for they had reached the summit of the\npath by this time and were looking down upon a small, white villa that\nnestled in a green microcosm between the naked chines of the dark,\ninterior hills. A miniature Eden indeed, thought Colonel Glinka, of figs\nand cinnamons, of date palms and patchouli, all enclosed within a high\nwire fence.\n\nThey descended, and Abdul Hakkim ben Salazar, with a flourish, produced\na great bronze key and unlocked the iron gate. \"The Sidi Doctor,\" he\nsaid, \"will doubtless be in his conservatory, making flowers.\"\n\n\"A godlike pastime,\" said Colonel Glinka with heavy irony. \"And where\nmay this hotbed of new life be found?\"\n\n\"Over there,\" Abdul said, pointing toward a narrow, screened,\nquonsetlike annex which protruded from the rear of the villa. \"Come with\nme and I will show you.\"\n\n\"You will not,\" Colonel Glinka said, smiting him upon the thigh once\nagain with the heavy cane. \"You will remain here and keep silent.\"\n\n\"Ouchdammit!\" Abdul exclaimed. \"You be careful with that thing, Joe,\nokay?\"\n\n\"_You_ be careful, my boy,\" Colonel Glinka said and marched swiftly\naround the corner of the house, opened the screen door of the\nconservatory, and entered.\n\nHere, amid long, terraced rows of tropical plants, a bearded dwarf in a\ngreen coat crouched before an earthen tray of lilies of the valley,\ntranquilly puffing up a massive, tobacco-stained meerschaum. He did not\nlook up at the sound of the intruder, for he was engaged in a delicate\nbusiness, the transfer of pollen from corolla to corolla with a\ntoothpick.\n\n\"So you are, after all, only a minor god,\" Colonel Glinka said.\n\n\"I heard your plane and I watched you come up the path,\" the black\nbearded little man said. \"Glinka, is it not?\"\n\n\"You remembered me!\" Colonel Glinka, quite affectedly, removed his\ngoggles and dabbed at his eye with a perfumed handkerchief. \"A humble\npoliceman, a fat little nobody, to be remembered by the great Dr.\nStefanik who was once our greatest scientist--yes, our most brilliant\ngeneticist--do not shake your head. Let me see, was it Ankara where last\nwe met? Yes, eight years ago in Ankara. You got away from me in Ankara.\nI was so ashamed, Comrade, that I cried.\"\n\n\"Nine years,\" the other corrected. \"For one remembers a mad dog. And do\nnot call me 'comrade,' Comrade. You know that I was never anything other\nthan a simple Cossack.\"\n\n\"And, as such, invariably troublesome to us,\" Colonel Glinka said. \"Yet\nyou were our white hope, Comrade Stefanik. We might have led the world,\nI am told, in organics as we now lead in physics. I have read all of\nyour books upon the fascinating subject of chromosomic change and the\nmorphology of rats. It was required reading for those of us who were\nassigned to you. Most interesting, though I confess I did not understand\nall of it.\"\n\n\n\nDr. Stefanik got slowly to his feet. His back was now revealed to be so\ncruelly deformed that his black beard curled against his smock, and he\nwalked with a shuffling, crablike motion as he limped over to pick up a\nsmall rubber irrigation hose.\n\n\"Why did you leave us, Comrade Stefanik?\" asked Colonel Glinka. \"Why\nshame us, discredit your government, by running away?\"\n\n\"I did not like it there,\" Dr. Stefanik said.\n\n\"We knew, of course, that you were on the verge of some great discovery,\nsome new process, perhaps, of controlling human development. A genetical\nmeans, our biologists tell me, which might have made us all supermen,\ntall and brilliant, and immune to disease. A race of Pavlovs and\nStakhanovs. Do you deny this?\"\n\nDr. Stefanik merely sucked upon his pipe calmly, twisted a valve half\nhidden in the greenery. A spray of brilliant green liquid emerged from\nthe nozzle of the hose, bathing the plants in a gentle emerald mist.\n\n\"It is true,\" he said at last, \"that I had experimented in those days\nwith a new process of alloploidy.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\"\n\n\"Alloploidy is the manipulation of chromosomic patterns which allows us\nto superimpose the character of our most perfect specimens upon those of\nless fortunate hereditary traits within the species.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Colonel Glinka, who had not really quite seen. \"Exactly. A\nsuper-race, to rule the world. Imagine, Comrade!\"\n\n\"Only super-rats and the like,\" Dr. Stefanik told him calmly, \"for you\nmay go home and tell them that I have never seen fit to experiment with\nhuman beings, Glinka, and I never will.\"\n\n\"_I_ tell them _that_?\" Colonel Glinka cried. \"Would I dare? Oh, no, you\nmust tell them yourself. That is why you will have to return with me.\"\n\n\"Never!\"\n\nColonel Glinka sighed prodigiously. \"I am afraid that our country is\ngoing to be dogs-in-the-manger in this matter,\" he said. \"You see, we\nare a jealous people by nature, and if we cannot have you, no one\nshall.\" And, deliberately, he laid the Malacca cane across his left arm,\nso that its tip was pointed squarely at Dr. Stefanik and the sinister\nround hole there clearly revealed to him.\n\n\"How melodramatic that is,\" Dr. Stefanik said.\n\n\"I know it,\" said Colonel Glinka, \"but you must remember that the\ncustoms officials in this part of the world are exceedingly tiresome\nabout firearms. This little gem, now, is quite discreet, and very\naccurate, and it will shoot you three times before you can say 'Never.'\nWill you not change your mind?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I _did_ so want to become tall and brilliant,\" Colonel Glinka said\nregretfully, and he started to press the handle of the cane.\n\n\"We are as tall as we stand,\" said Dr. Stefanik, and, swiftly focusing\nthe nozzle of the irrigation hose to a thin stream, squirted the\nstinging green fluid in Colonel Glinka's right and left eye.\n\n\n\n\"I know that you are in here somewhere!\" Colonel Glinka yelped. \"Be\nassured that I shall find you, Comrade, and when I do, it will not be\npleasant for you! Oh, my--no, indeed!\"\n\nHis eyes were red and streaming. He wiped them with the lavender-scented\nhandkerchief, got down upon his hands and knees and started to crawl\nalong the terraced rows of tropical plants, looking under each bench as\nhe came to it. When he had reached the end, he turned and crawled up the\nother side.\n\nAt the far end of the conservatory, he stood up with a baffled grunt. \"I\nknow that you are in here,\" he said.\n\nSomething tickled the back of his neck. He whirled like a Dervish, but\nfound only a drooping, blood-red plant like nothing ever created by\nnature confronting him.\n\n\"I am getting jumpy,\" Colonel Glinka growled. \"A little jumpy in my\nbusiness is good, but too much is bad for the health.\" And he went,\nstraightway, and closed the back door of the conservatory and dragged a\nheavy rack of trailing orchids in front of it, humming a furious little\nmarch from _The Guardsman_ as he worked.\n\n\"You must know,\" he said loudly, \"that I do not altogether believe you,\nStefanik, when you imply that you have abandoned this research. Nor will\nthey. For who, then, are these degenerate wretches who stand upon the\nhills and gawk at us, and why must you feed them? I know that they were\nnot created by you, but it is possible that they are paid to be your\nguinea pigs. Perhaps you are all in the pay of the British. Am I right?\"\n\nHe listened. There was no answer.\n\nCompleting his examination of the conservatory, he entered the main\nvilla and searched it thoroughly, as he had been trained to do, looking\nin every cupboard and closet and under the beds.\n\nWhen he had exhausted these hiding places, he left by the front door and\nclosed it after him, with a narrow, jamming wedge that he had made of\nhalf a lead pencil.\n\nThere were many places to hide in the garden, but Colonel Glinka took\nthem one by one, glancing behind him from time to time in order to make\ncertain that he was not being followed around and around the house in a\ngrim sort of Maypole dance.\n\n\"I know that you are out here, Comrade,\" he said.\n\nPresently he had arrived back where he had started, sweating profusely,\nand was about to retrace the entire circuit when he caught a glimpse of\nsomething moving in the undergrowth of patchouli near the gate. He aimed\nthe Malacca cane and pressed a part of its handle with his thumb. A\nbullet whined off the steel gatepost.\n\n\"Stop there, my friend!\" he commanded.\n\nAbdul Hakkim ben Salazar slowly rose from the bushes with his hands high\nabove his head.\n\n\"You got me, Joe,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe gate was wide open; Stefanik's route of escape now painfully\nobvious.\n\nColonel Glinka stared thoughtfully up at the darkening ridges where the\nsun set in that sanguinary glory observable only in these latitudes, and\nthe dusk crept swiftly up from the seaward-reaching ravines.\n\n\"So,\" Colonel Glinka said. \"That is where he has gone, thinking to elude\nme forever. But you--\" he waggled the cane at Abdul, who was already\nshaking his head in the negative--\"will lead me to him. You know his\nhabits, and, what is more, you are almost certainly familiar with every\nhiding place on this island, since it is your whim to be chased all over\nit by the females.\"\n\n\"Too dark, Effendi,\" Abdul said. \"If we go out now, they will not only\nchase us; they will catch us, for they are able to see very well in the\ndark.\"\n\n\"_Who_ will catch us?\"\n\n\"These people. They are worse than Tuaregs. For all I know, they may be\ndescended from the Tuaregs, and everyone knows that a Tuareg would as\nsoon cut a man's throat as kiss the hem of his burnoose.\"\n\n\"So now they are Tuaregs.\" Colonel Glinka nodded, with a slow, ferocious\nsmile. \"Yet you have hinted that they are the spawn of Comrade\nStefanik's genius, the children of genetical science, stamped with 'Made\nin the Seychelles' upon their bottoms. Perhaps they were grown in the\nconservatory, from Tuareg seed.\"\n\nAbdul grimaced. \"I do not remember saying that, though sometimes I say\nthings that I don't remember later. Perhaps they are not Tuaregs, then.\nTo tell the truth, they were already living here when I came to work for\nthe Sidi Doctor Stephens, and so naturally I thought that he had made\nthem, for there were no people upon this island in the old days. Only\nthe seabirds and a few wild goats, perhaps.\"\n\nColonel Glinka clasped his hand to his forehead. \"Stop, stop, or I shall\ngo mad!\"\n\nAbdul Hakkim obediently sat down and crossed his legs, starting to light\nthe second of the very bad cigarettes that he had cadged.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Colonel Glinka said softly.\n\n\"Nothing, Effendi.\"\n\n\"Get up! Get up and get moving, my boy, or make your peace with Allah!\nDid you suppose for one moment that I had forgotten what we were talking\nabout?\"\n\n\n\nIt was quite dark by the time they had reached the summit of the ridge,\nbut Colonel Glinka still marched along behind Abdul, high good humor\nrestored, prodding him from time to time with the Malacca cane and\nlecturing him upon social equalities and other Party doctrine.\n\n\"Are we nearly there?\" he would interrupt himself to ask from time to\ntime.\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"Call out, then.\"\n\n\"I am afraid.\"\n\nA savage poke with the cane, a war whoop from Abdul Hakkim ben Salazar.\nNo answer.\n\n\"We'll get him,\" Colonel Glinka would say. \"Oh, my, yes.\"\n\nBut an hour had passed and still they had encountered no living thing\nupon the path.\n\nAt last Abdul stopped abruptly. They were in a little, narrow ravine,\nhigh above the sea, with looming red cliffs all about them, and the\nbooming of the surf upon the distant, windward shore of the island\nplainly audible.\n\n\"Why have we stopped here?\" Colonel Glinka said, bumping into him.\n\n\"Look there, Effendi!\" Abdul whispered, gesturing toward a ledge not ten\nyards above their heads, where a burnoosed figure stood looking down\nupon them.\n\n\"And there--and there--and there!\" Abdul pointed at other little ledges\nwhere similar ghostly sentries stood, barely visible in the gloom.\n\nColonel Glinka looked behind him and saw that there were others that\nthey had passed within a very few feet of, standing upon every shelf and\nledge that afforded a foot-hold above the trail. Dozens and dozens of\nthem.\n\n\"Maybe we had better scram out of here, Joe,\" Abdul suggested.\n\n\"I perceive that you are trying to frighten me,\" Colonel Glinka said.\n\"It won't work.\"\n\nA stone rattled behind them.\n\n\"What was that?\" Colonel Glinka demanded, turning around quickly. \"Who's\nthere?\"\n\n\n\nSomething moved in the shadows, edging into the deeper shadows of the\nrocks. It was the pursuing female of earlier that afternoon.\n\nAbdul Hakkim ben Salazar, in deep, abdominal disgust, groaned.\n\n\"Come here, you!\" Colonel Glinka commanded. \"Come on over here. Don't be\nafraid, my little one--I won't hurt you.\"\n\nShe advanced ever so little, a shapeless white wraith attracted by the\nsyrup in his voice. He took one step forward. Carefully she retreated a\nstep.\n\n\"Come now,\" Colonel Glinka said. \"Surely it is time that we met. For you\nmay as well know that I am now the master of this island. Now and\nforevermore, so far as you are concerned, my child. Perhaps I may let\nyou help me clear up a little of its mystery.\"\n\nShe kept a maddening five or six feet between them, somehow. He could\nnot lessen the distance without alarming her. And so he balanced himself\nupon the balls of his feet and lunged.\n\nShe gave a little cry, stumbled and fell, rolling over and over into a\ndark little depression beside the path as he clutched at her robe. The\ngarment, still in his hand, unwound easily, peeling her very much like\nan apple.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" Colonel Glinka said, scrambling after her upon his\nhands and knees, groping for her with outstretched arms. \"I beg--\" His\nhand touched something which might have been her ankle. He seized it,\nheld it for a moment, and then, shuddering, let it go, drawing back his\nhand as if it had been stabbed. By now the night was quite dark.\n\nColonel Glinka scrambled to his feet, half instinctively raised the\ndeadly Malacca cane.\n\n\"Don't do it, Joe!\" cried Abdul, coming up from behind him and shoving\nhim hard.\n\nThe shot went wild, but the sound of it, echoing up and down the ravine,\nstarted an ominous, new sound, the growing, staccato murmur of many\nvoices, a rattling of stones, a hundred different movements in the\nblackness.\n\nColonel Glinka fired the last bullet more wildly still, hurled the\nMalacca cane at them, and ran.\n\n\n\nAbdul Hakkim ben Salazar, who had been many leaps ahead of him, arrived\nbreathless at the front gate of the villa, opened it, dived through,\nlocked it behind him, and threw himself upon the grass to catch his\nbreath.\n\nThere was a cheerful glow in the darkness. The slight, grotesque figure\nof Dr. Stefanik and his pipe emerged from the shadows.\n\n\"Ah,\" Abdul breathed, \"where were you, Sidi, when I was out there dying\nfor you?\"\n\n\"Hiding up the tallest cinnamon tree, like a monkey,\" Dr. Stefanik said.\n\nThey sat there upon the grass for a long while in companionable silence,\nheeding the sounds of the night, which was balmy and infinitely\npeaceful.\n\nThere came a high-pitched, long-drawn-out scream from somewhere on the\nridge.\n\n\"They got him,\" Abdul said.\n\n\"And now they will pluck him, I suppose,\" said Dr. Stefanik. \"There, by\nthe way, is a thing that even _I_ have never completely understood about\nthem. Their insatiable curiosity, of course, is a vestigial trait that\nwill pass, but this other drive, I fear, this rather alarming passion\nthat they have shown for the up-breeding of the species may be some\nuniversal of life itself that no man may touch or alter.\"\n\nDown the path from the ridge, a small, white-robed figure came running,\nfar ahead of the others, bent upon her own schemes of evolution.\n\nAbdul crouched lower in the shadows. \"That one makes even the heart of a\nman swell within his breast,\" he whispered, \"for she does not ever give\nup.\"\n\n\"That no man may touch,\" Dr. Stefanik repeated, and nodded his shaggy\nhead wisely. \"As an idealist, I may have given them shoes and\nenlightenment, but I did not give them this, and so they are not\naltogether mine. _His_ kind still professes to believe in the common\ndenominator and the common level, seeking to drag down the few from\ntheir gilt palaces and haul up the masses from the muck. Tell me, as a\nHadj who is, at the same time, undoubtedly vermin-ridden, do _you_\nbelieve in the equality of men--or can you honestly wish it?\"\n\n\"All of us to be Effendis?\"\n\n\"Something like that.\"\n\nAbdul Hakkim ben Salazar thought about it for a time with furrowed brow.\n\"No, Sidi,\" he said at last, \"for then there would be no one to chase\nus.\"\n\nThe female stopped, knelt in the path.\n\n\"What is she doing now?\" Dr. Stefanik asked.\n\n\"She is taking off her shoes, in order to run faster than me.\"\n\n\"'... And cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon\nthe earth after his kind'! And yet you told Glinka _I_ made them!\"\n\n\"Ah, but not out of _what_, Sidi,\" Abdul said.\n\nThe female, with a hopeful little bleat, arose and tucked her shoes\nunder her arm, for youth is hope and kids will be kids, and off she\nwent, clip-clop, clip-clop, down the rocky path to the sea.",
