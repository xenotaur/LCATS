    "body": "Kaiser stared at the tape in his hand for a long uncomprehending\nminute. How long had the stuff been coming through in this inane baby\ntalk? And why hadn't he noticed it before? Why had he had to read this\nlast communication a third time before he recognized anything unusual\nabout it?\n\nHe went over the words again, as though maybe this time they'd read as\nthey should.\n\n    OO IS SICK, SMOKY. DO TO BEDDY-BY. KEEP UM WARM. WHEN UM FEELS\n    BETTER, LET USNS KNOW.\n\n    SS II\n\nKaiser let himself ease back in the pilot chair and rolled the tape\nthoughtfully between his fingers. Overhead and to each side, large\ndrops of rain thudded softly against the transparent walls of the scout\nship and dripped wearily from the bottom ledge to the ground.\n\n\"Damn this climate!\" Kaiser muttered irrelevantly. \"Doesn't it ever do\nanything here except rain?\"\n\nHis attention returned to the matter at hand. Why the baby talk? And\nwhy was his memory so hazy? How long had he been here? What had he been\ndoing during that time?\n\nListlessly he reached for the towel at his elbow and wiped the moisture\nfrom his face and bare shoulders. The air conditioning had gone out\nwhen the scout ship cracked up. He'd have to repair the scout or he\nwas stuck here for good. He remembered now that he had gone over the\njob very carefully and thoroughly, and had found it too big to handle\nalone--or without better equipment, at least. Yet there was little or\nno chance of his being able to find either here.\n\nCalmly, deliberately, Kaiser collected his thoughts, his memories, and\nbrought them out where he could look at them:\n\nThe mother ship, _Soscites II_, had been on the last leg of its\nplanet-mapping tour. It had dropped Kaiser in the one remaining scout\nship--the other seven had all been lost one way or another during the\nexploring of new worlds--and set itself into a giant orbit about this\nplanet that Kaiser had named Big Muddy.\n\nThe _Soscites II_ had to maintain its constant speed; it had no means\nof slowing, except to stop, and no way to start again once it did stop.\nIts limited range of maneuverability made it necessary to set up an\norbit that would take it approximately one month, Earth time, to circle\na pinpointed planet. And now its fuel was low.\n\nKaiser had that one month to repair his scout or be stranded here\nforever.\n\nThat was all he could remember. Nothing of what he had been doing\nrecently.\n\nA small shiver passed through his body as he glanced once again at the\ntape in his hand. Baby talk....\n\n\n\nOne thing he could find out: how long this had been going on. He\nturned to the communicator and unhooked the paper receptacle on its\nbottom. It held about a yard and a half of tape, probably his last\nseveral messages--both those sent and those received. He pulled it out\nimpatiently and began reading.\n\nThe first was from himself:\n\n    YOUR SUGGESTIONS NO HELP. HOW AM I GOING TO REPAIR DAMAGE TO SCOUT\n    WITHOUT PROPER EQUIPMENT? AND WHERE DO I GET IT? DO YOU THINK I\n    FOUND A TOOL SHOP DOWN HERE? FOR GOD'S SAKE, COME UP WITH SOMETHING\n    BETTER.\n\n    VISITED SEAL-PEOPLE AGAIN TODAY. STILL HAVE THEIR STINK IN MY NOSE.\n    FOUND HUTS ALONG RIVER BANK, SO I GUESS THEY DON'T LIVE IN WATER.\n    BUT THEY DO SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME THERE. NO, I HAVE NO WAY OF\n    ESTIMATING THEIR INTELLIGENCE. I WOULD JUDGE IT AVERAGES NO HIGHER\n    THAN SEVEN-YEAR-OLD HUMAN. THEY DEFINITELY DO TALK TO ONE ANOTHER.\n    WILL TRY TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THEM, BUT YOU GET TO WORK FAST ON\n    HOW I REPAIR SCOUT.\n\n    SWELLING IN ARM WORSE AND AM DEVELOPING A FEVER. TEMPERATURE 102.7\n    AN HOUR AGO.\n\n    SMOKY\n\nThe ship must have answered immediately, for the return message time\nwas six hours later than his own, the minimum interval necessary for\ntwo-way exchange.\n\n    DOING OUR BEST, SMOKY. YOUR IMMEDIATE PROBLEM, AS WE SEE IT, IS TO\n    KEEP WELL. WE FED ALL THE INFORMATION YOU GAVE US INTO SAM, BUT YOU\n    DIDN'T HAVE MUCH EXCEPT THE STING IN YOUR ARM. AS EXPECTED, ALL\n    THAT CAME OUT WAS \"DATA INSUFFICIENT.\" TRY TO GIVE US MORE. ALSO\n    DETAIL ALL SYMPTOMS SINCE YOUR LAST REPORT. IN THE MEANTIME, WE'RE\n    DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN AT THIS END. GOOD LUCK.\n\n    SS II\n\nSam, Kaiser knew, was the ship's mechanical diagnostician. His report\nfollowed:\n\n    ARM SWOLLEN. UNABLE TO KEEP DOWN FOOD LAST TWELVE HOURS. ABOUT TWO\n    HOURS AGO, ENTIRE BODY TURNED LIVID RED. BRIEF PERIODS OF\n    BLANKNESS. THINGS KEEP COMING AND GOING. SICK AS HELL. HURRY.\n\n    SMOKY\n\nThe ship's next message read:\n\n    INFECTION QUITE DEFINITE. BUT SOMETHING STRANGE THERE. GIVE US\n    ANYTHING MORE YOU HAVE.\n\n    SS II\n\nHis own reply perplexed Kaiser:\n\n    LAST LETTER FUNNY. I NOT UNDERSTAND. WHY IS OO SENDING GARBLE TALK?\n    DID USNS MAKE UP SECRET MESSAGES?\n\n    SMOKY\n\nThe expedition, apparently, was as puzzled as he:\n\n    WHAT'S THE MATTER, SMOKY? THAT LAST MESSAGE WAS IN PLAIN TERRAN. NO\n    REASON WHY YOU COULDN'T READ IT. AND WHY THE BABY TALK? IF YOU'RE\n    SPOOFING, STOP. GIVE US MORE SYMPTOMS. HOW ARE YOU FEELING NOW?\n\n    SS II\n\nThe baby talk was worse on Kaiser's next:\n\n    TWAZY. WHAT FOR OO TENDING TWAZY LETTERS? FINK UM CAN WEAD TWAZY\n    LETTERS? SKIN ALL YELLOW NOW. COLD. COLD. CO\n\nThe ship's following communication was three hours late. It was the\nlast on the tape--the one Kaiser had read earlier. Apparently they\ndecided to humor him.\n\n    OO IS SICK, SMOKY. DO TO BEDDY-BY. KEEP UM WARM. WHEN UM FEELS\n    BETTER, LET USNS KNOW.\n\n    SS II\n\nThat was not much help. All it told him was that he had been sick.\n\nHe felt better now, outside of a muscular weariness, as though\nconvalescing from a long illness. He put the back of his hand to his\nforehead. Cool. No fever anyway.\n\nHe glanced at the clock-calendar on the instrument board and back at\nthe date and time on the tape where he'd started his baby talk. Twenty\nhours. He hadn't been out of his head too long. He began punching the\ncommunicator keys while he nibbled at a biscuit.\n\n    SEEM TO BE FULLY RECOVERED. FEELING FINE. ANYTHING NEW FROM SAM?\n    AND HOW ABOUT THE DAMAGE TO SCOUT? GIVE ME ANYTHING YOU HAVE ON\n    EITHER OR BOTH.\n\n    SMOKY\n\nKaiser felt suddenly weary. He lay on the scout's bunk and tried\nto sleep. Soon he was in that phantasm land between sleep and\nwakefulness--he knew he was not sleeping, yet he did dream.\n\nIt was the same dream he had had many times before. In it, he was back\nhome again, the home he had joined the space service to escape. He had\nrealized soon after his marriage that his wife, Helene, did not love\nhim. She had married him for the security his pay check provided. And\nthough it soon became evident that she, too, regretted her bargain,\nshe would not divorce him. Instead, she had her revenge on him by\npersistent nagging, by letting herself grow fat and querulous, and by\ncaring for their house only in a slovenly way.\n\nHer crippled brother had moved in with them the day they were married.\nHis mind was as crippled as his body and he took an unhealthy delight\nin helping his sister torment Kaiser.\n\n\n\nKaiser came wide awake in a cold sweat. The clock showed that only an\nhour had passed since he had sent his last message to the ship. Still\nfive more long hours to wait. He rose and wiped the sweat from his neck\nand shoulders and restlessly paced the small corridor of the scout.\n\nAfter a few minutes, he stopped pacing and peered out into the gloom of\nBig Muddy. The rain seemed to have eased off some. Not much more than a\nheavy drizzle now.\n\nKaiser reached impulsively for the slicker he had thrown over a chest\nagainst one wall and put it on, then a pair of hip-high plastic boots\nand a plastic hat. He opened the door. The scout had come to rest with\na slight tilt when it crashed, and Kaiser had to sit down and roll\nover onto his stomach to ease himself to the ground.\n\nThe weather outside was normal for Big Muddy: wet, humid, and warm.\n\nKaiser sank to his ankles in soft mud before his feet reached solid\nground. He half walked and half slid to the rear of the scout. Beside\nthe ship, the \"octopus\" was busily at work. Tentacles and antennae,\nextending from the yard-high box of its body, tested and recorded\ntemperature, atmosphere, soil, and all other pertinent planetary\nconditions. The octopus was connected to the ship's communicator and\nall its findings were being transmitted to the mother ship for study.\n\nKaiser observed that it was working well and turned toward a wide,\nsluggish river, perhaps two hundred yards from the scout. Once there,\nhe headed upstream. He could hear the pipings, and now and then a\nhigher whistling, of the seal-people before he reached a bend and saw\nthem. As usual, most were swimming in the river.\n\nOne old fellow, whose chocolate-brown fur showed a heavy intermixture\nof gray, was sitting on the bank of the river just at the bend. Perhaps\na lookout. He pulled himself to his feet as he spied Kaiser and his\ntoothless, hard-gummed mouth opened and emitted a long whistle that\nmight have been a greeting--or a warning to the others that a stranger\napproached.\n\nThe native stood perhaps five feet tall, with the heavy, blubbery\nbody of a seal, and short, thick arms. Membranes connected the arms\nto his body from shoulder-pits to mid-biceps. The arms ended in\nthree-fingered, thumbless hands. His legs also were short and thick,\nwith footpads that splayed out at forty-five-degree angles. They gave\nhis legs the appearance of a split tail. About him hung a rank-fish\nsmell that made Kaiser's stomach squirm.\n\nThe old fellow sounded a cheerful chirp as Kaiser came near. Feeling\nslightly ineffectual, Kaiser raised both hands and held them palm\nforward. The other chirped again and Kaiser went on toward the main\ngroup.\n\n\n\nThey had stopped their play and eating as Kaiser approached and now\nmost of them swam in to shore and stood in the water, staring and\npiping. They varied in size from small seal-pups to full-grown adults.\nSome chewed on bunches of water weed, which they manipulated with their\nlips and drew into their mouths.\n\nThey had mammalian characteristics, Kaiser had noted before, so it\nwas not difficult to distinguish the females from the males. The\nproportion was roughly fifty-fifty.\n\nSeveral of the bolder males climbed up beside Kaiser and began pawing\nhis plastic clothing. Kaiser stood still and tried to keep his\nbreathing shallow, for their odor was almost more than he could bear.\nOne native smeared Kaiser's face with an exploring paw and Kaiser\ngagged and pushed him roughly away. He was bound by regulations to\ndisplay no hostility to newly discovered natives, but he couldn't take\nmuch more of this.\n\nA young female splashed water on two young males who stood near and\nthey turned with shrill pipings and chased her into the water. The\nentire group seemed to lose interest in Kaiser and joined in the chase,\nor went back to other diversions of their own. Kaiser's inspectors\nfollowed.\n\nThey were a mindless lot, Kaiser observed. The river supplied them with\nan easy existence, with food and living space, and apparently they had\nfew natural enemies.\n\nKaiser walked away, following the long slow bend of the river, and\ncame to a collection of perhaps two hundred dwellings built in three\nhaphazard rows along the river bank. He took time to study their\nconstruction more closely this time.\n\nThey were all round domes, little more than the height of a man, built\nof blocks that appeared to be mud, packed with river weed and sand. How\nthey were able to dry these to give them the necessary solidity, Kaiser\ndid not know. He had found no signs that they knew how to use fire, and\nall apparent evidence was against their having it. They then had to\nhave sunlight. Maybe it rained less during certain seasons.\n\nThe domes' construction was based on a series of four arches built in a\ncircle. When the base covering the periphery had been laid, four others\nwere built on and between them, and continued in successive tiers until\nthe top was reached. Each tier thus furnished support for the next\nabove. No other framework was needed. The final tier formed the roof.\nThey made sound shelters, but Kaiser had peered into several and found\nthem dark and dank--and as smelly as the natives themselves.\n\nThe few loungers in the village paid little attention to Kaiser and\nhe wandered through the irregular streets until he became bored and\nreturned to the scout.\n\nThe _Soscites II_ sent little that helped during the next twelve hours\nand Kaiser occupied his time trying again to repair the damage to the\nscout.\n\nThe job appeared maddeningly simply. As the scout had glided in for\na soft landing, its metal bottom had ridden a concealed rock and bent\ninward. The bent metal had carried up with it the tube supplying the\nfuel pump and flattened it against the motor casing.\n\n\n\nOpening the tube again would not have been difficult, but first it had\nto be freed from under the ship. Kaiser had tried forcing the sheet\nmetal back into place with a small crowbar--the best leverage he had on\nhand--but it resisted his best efforts. He still could think of no way\nto do the job, simple as it was, though he gave his concentration to it\nthe rest of the day.\n\nThat evening, Kaiser received information from the _Soscites II_ that\nwas at least definite:\n\n    SET YOURSELF FOR A SHOCK, SMOKY. SAM FINALLY CAME THROUGH. YOU\n    WON'T LIKE WHAT YOU HEAR. AT LEAST NOT AT FIRST. BUT IT COULD BE\n    WORSE. YOU HAVE BEEN INVADED BY A SYMBIOTE--SIMILAR TO THE TYPE\n    FOUND ON THE SAND WORLD, BARTEL-BLEETHERS. GIVE US A FEW MORE HOURS\n    TO WORK WITH SAM AND WE'LL GET YOU ALL THE PARTICULARS HE CAN GIVE\n    US. HANG ON NOW!\n\n    SOSCITES II\n\nKaiser's reply was short and succinct:\n\n    WHAT THE HELL?\n\n    SMOKY\n\n_Soscites II's_ next communication followed within twenty minutes and\nwas signed by the ship's doctor:\n\n    JUST A FEW WORDS, SMOKY, IN CASE YOU'RE WORRIED. I THOUGHT I'D GET\n    THIS OFF WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR MORE INFORMATION FROM SAM.\n    REMEMBER THAT A SYMBIOTE IS NOT A PARASITE. IT WILL NOT HARM YOU,\n    EXCEPT INADVERTENTLY. YOUR WELFARE IS AS ESSENTIAL TO IT AS TO YOU.\n    ALMOST CERTAINLY, IF YOU DIE, IT WILL DIE WITH YOU. ANY TROUBLE\n    YOU'VE HAD SO FAR WAS PROBABLY CAUSED BY THE SYMBIOTE'S DIFFICULTY\n    IN ADJUSTING ITSELF TO ITS NEW ENVIRONMENT. IN A WAY, I ENVY YOU.\n    MORE LATER, WHEN WE FINISH WITH SAM.\n\n    J. G. ZARWELL\n\nKaiser did not answer. The news was so startling, so unforeseen, that\nhis mind refused to accept the actuality. He lay on the scout's bunk\nand stared at the ceiling without conscious attention, and with very\nlittle clear thought, for several hours--until the next communication\ncame in:\n\n    WELL, THIS IS WHAT SAM HAS TO SAY, SMOKY. SYMBIOTE AMICABLE AND\n    APPARENTLY SWIFTLY ADAPTABLE. YOUR CHANGING COLOR, DIFFICULTY IN\n    EATING AND EVEN BABY TALK WERE THE RESULT OF ITS EFFORTS TO GIVE\n    YOU WHAT IT BELIEVED YOU NEEDED OR WANTED.\n\n    CHANGING COLOR: PROTECTIVE CAMOUFLAGE. TROUBLE KEEPING FOOD DOWN:\n    IT KEPT YOUR STOMACH EMPTY BECAUSE IT SENSED YOU WERE IN TROUBLE\n    AND MIGHT HAVE NEED FOR SHARP REFLEXES, WITH NO EXCESS WEIGHT TO\n    CARRY. THE BABY TALK WE AREN'T TOO CERTAIN ABOUT, BUT OUR BEST\n    CONCLUSION IS THAT WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD, YOU WERE MOST HAPPY. IT\n    WAS TRYING TO GIVE YOU BACK THAT HAPPY STATE OF MIND. OBVIOUSLY IT\n    QUICKLY RECOGNIZED THE MISTAKES IT MADE AND CORRECTED THEM.\n\n    SAM CAME UP WITH A FEW MORE IDEAS, BUT WE WANT TO WORK ON THEM A\n    BIT BEFORE WE SEND THEM THROUGH. SLEEP ON THIS.\n\n    SS II\n\n\n\nKaiser could imagine that most of the crew were not too concerned about\nthe trouble he was in. He was not the gregarious type and had no close\nfriends on board. He had hoped to find the solitude he liked best in\nspace, but he had been disappointed. True, there were fewer people\nhere, but he was brought into such intimate contact with them that he\nwould have been more contented living in a crowded city.\n\nHis naturally unsociable nature was more irksome to the crew because\nhe was more intelligent and efficient than they were. He did his work\nwell and painstakingly and was seldom in error. They would have liked\nhim better had he been more prone to mistakes. He was certain that they\nrespected him, but they did not like him. And he returned the dislike.\n\nThe suggestion that he get some sleep might not be a bad idea. He\nhadn't slept in over eighteen hours, Kaiser realized--and fell\ninstantly asleep.\n\nThe communicator had a message waiting for him when he awoke:\n\n    SAM COULDN'T HELP US MUCH ON THIS PART, BUT AFTER RESEARCH AND MUCH\n    DISCUSSION, WE ARRIVED AT THE FOLLOWING TWO CONCLUSIONS.\n\n    FIRST, PHYSICAL PROPERTY OF SYMBIOTE IS EITHER THAT OF A VERY THIN\n    LIQUID OR, MORE PROBABLY, A VIRUS FORM WITH SWIFT PROPAGATION\n    CHARACTERISTIC. IT UNDOUBTEDLY LIVES IN YOUR BLOOD STREAM AND\n    PERMEATES YOUR SYSTEM.\n\n    SECOND, IT SEEMED TO US, AS IT MUST HAVE TO YOU, THAT THE SYMBIOTE\n    COULD ONLY KNOW WHAT YOU WANTED BY READING YOUR MIND. HOWEVER, WE\n    BELIEVE DIFFERENTLY NOW. WE THINK THAT IT HAS SUCH CLOSE CONTACT\n    WITH YOUR GLANDS AND THEIR SECRETIONS, WHICH STIMULATE EMOTION,\n    THAT IT CAN GAUGE YOUR FEELINGS EVEN MORE ACCURATELY THAN YOU\n    YOURSELF CAN. THUS IT CAN JUDGE YOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES QUITE\n    ACCURATELY.\n\n    WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU TEST OUR THEORY. THERE ARE DOZENS OF\n    WAYS. IF YOU ARE STUMPED AND NEED SUGGESTIONS, JUST LET US KNOW.\n    WE AWAIT WORD FROM YOU WITH GREAT INTEREST.\n\n    SS II\n\nBy now, Kaiser had accepted what had happened to him. His distress and\nanxiety were gone and he was impatient to do what he could to establish\nbetter contact with his uninvited tenant. With eager anticipation, he\nset to thinking how it could be done. After a few minutes, an idea\noccurred to him.\n\nTaking a small scalpel from a medical kit, he made a shallow cut in\nhis arm, just deep enough to bleed freely. He knew that the pain would\nsupply the necessary glandular reaction. The cut bled a few slow\ndrops--and as Kaiser watched, a shiny film formed and the bleeding\nstopped.\n\nThat checked pretty well with the ship's theory.\n\nPerhaps the symbiote had made his senses more acute. He tried closing\nhis eyes and fingering several objects in the room. It seemed to him\nthat he could determine the texture of each better than before, but\nthe test was inconclusive. Walking to the rear of the scout, he tried\nreading the printed words on the instrument panel. Each letter stood\nout sharp and clear!\n\nKaiser wondered if he might not make an immediate, practical use of the\nsymbiote's apparent desire to help him. Concentrating on the discomfort\nof the high humidity and exaggerating his own displeasure with it, he\nwaited. The result surprised and pleased him.\n\nThe temperature within the scout cabin seemed to lower, the moisture\non his body vanished, and he was more comfortable than he had yet been\nhere.\n\nAs a double check, he looked at the ship's thermometer. Temperature\n102, humidity 113--just about the same as it had been on earlier\nreadings.\n\n\n\nDuring the next twenty-four hours, Kaiser and the mother ship exchanged\nmessages at regular six-hour intervals. In between, he worked at\nrepairing the damaged scout. He had no more success than before.\n\nHe tired easily and lay on the cot often to rest. Each time he seemed\nto drop off to sleep immediately--and awake at the exact times he\nhad decided on beforehand. At first, despite the lack of success in\nstraightening the bent metal of the scout bottom, there had been a\nsubdued exhilaration in reporting each new discovery concerning the\nsymbiote, but as time passed, his enthusiasm ebbed. His one really\nimportant problem was how to repair the scout and he was fast becoming\ndiscouraged.\n\nAt last Kaiser could bear the futility of his efforts no longer. He\nsent out a terse message to the _Soscites II_:\n\n    TAKING SHORT TRIP TO ANOTHER LOCATION ON RIVER. HOPE TO FIND MORE\n    INTELLIGENT NATIVES. COULD BE THAT THE SETTLEMENT I FOUND HERE IS\n    ANALOGOUS TO TRIBE OF MONKEYS ON EARTH. I KNOW THE CHANCE IS SMALL,\n    BUT WHAT HAVE I TO LOSE? I CAN'T FIX SCOUT WITHOUT BETTER TOOLS,\n    AND IF MY GUESS IS RIGHT, I MAY BE ABLE TO GET EQUIPMENT. EXPECT TO\n    RETURN IN TEN OR TWELVE HOURS. PLEASE KEEP CONTACT WITH SCOUT.\n\n    SMOKY\n\nKaiser packed a mudsled with tent, portable generator and guard wires,\na spare sidearm and ammunition, and food for two days. He had noticed\nthat a range of high hills, which caused the bend in the river at\nthe native settlement, seemed to continue its long curve, and he\nwondered if the hills might not turn the river in the shape of a giant\nhorseshoe. He intended to find out.\n\nWrapping his equipment in a plastic tarp, Kaiser eased it out the\ndoorway and tied it on the sled. He hooked a towline to a harness on\nhis shoulders and began his journey--in the opposite direction from the\nfirst native settlement.\n\nHe walked for more than seven hours before he found that his surmise\nhad been correct. And a second cluster of huts, and seal-people in the\nriver, greeted his sight. He received a further pleasant surprise. This\ngroup was decidedly more advanced than the first!\n\nThey were little different in actual physical appearance; the change\nwas mainly noticeable in their actions and demeanor. And their odor was\nmore subdued, less repugnant.\n\nBy signs, Kaiser indicated that he came in peace, and they seemed to\nunderstand. A thick-bodied male went solemnly to the river bank and\ncalled to a second, who dived and brought up a mouthful of weed. The\nfirst male took the weed and brought it to Kaiser. This was obviously a\ngesture of friendship.\n\nThe weed had a white starchy core and looked edible. Kaiser cleaned\npart of it with his handkerchief, bit and chewed it.\n\nThe weed had a slight iron taste, but was not unpalatable. He swallowed\nthe mouthful and tried another. He ate most of what had been given him\nand waited with some trepidation for a reaction.\n\n\n\nAs dusk fell, Kaiser set up his tent a few hundred yards back from the\nnative settlement. All apprehension about how his stomach would react\nto the river weed had left him. Apparently it could be assimilated by\nhis digestive system. Lying on his air mattress, he felt thoroughly at\npeace with this world.\n\nOnce, just before dropping off to sleep, he heard the snuffling noise\nof some large animal outside his tent and picked up a pistol, just in\ncase. However, the first jolt of the guard-wire charge discouraged the\nbeast and Kaiser heard it shuffle away, making puzzled mewing sounds as\nit went.\n\nThe next morning, Kaiser left off all his clothes except a pair of\nshorts and went swimming in the river. The seal-people were already in\nthe water when he arrived and were very friendly.\n\nThat friendliness nearly resulted in disaster. The natives crowded\naround as he swam--they maneuvered with an otter-like proficiency--and\noften nudged him with their bodies when they came too close. He had\ndifficulty keeping afloat and soon turned and started back. As he\nneared the river edge, a playful female grabbed him by the ankle and\npulled him under.\n\nKaiser tried to break her hold, but she evidently thought he was\nclowning and wrapped her warm furred arms around him and held him\nhelpless. They sank deeper.\n\nWhen his breath threatened to burst from his lungs in a stream of\nbubbles, and he still could not free himself, Kaiser brought his knee\nup into her stomach and her grip loosened abruptly. He reached the\nsurface, choking and coughing, and swam blindly toward shore until his\nfeet hit the river bottom.\n\nAs he stood on the bank, getting his breath, the natives were quiet and\nseemed to be looking at him reproachfully. He stood for a time, trying\nto think of a way to explain the necessity of what he had done, but\nthere was none. He shrugged helplessly.\n\nThere was no longer anything to be gained by staying here--if they\nhad the tools he needed, he had no way of finding out or asking for\nthem--and he packed and started back to the scout.\n\nKaiser's good spirits returned on his return journey. He had enjoyed\nthe relief from the tedium of spending day after day in the scout, and\nnow he enjoyed the exercise of pulling the mudsled. Above the waist,\nhe wore only the harness and the large, soft drops of rain against his\nbare skin were pleasant to feel.\n\nWhen he reached the scout, Kaiser began to unload the sled. The\ntarpaulin caught on the edge of a runner and he gave it a tug to free\nit. To his amazement, the heavy sled turned completely over, spilling\nthe equipment to the ground.\n\nPerplexed, Kaiser stooped and began replacing the spilled articles in\nthe tarp. They felt exceptionally light. He paused again, and suddenly\nhis eyes widened.\n\n\n\nMoving quickly to the door of the scout, he shoved his equipment\nthrough and crawled in behind it. He did not consult the communicator,\nas he customarily did on entering, but went directly to the warped\nplace on the floor and picked up the crowbar he had laid there.\n\nInserting the bar between the metal of the scout bottom and the engine\ncasing, he lifted. Nothing happened. He rested a minute and tried\nagain, this time concentrating on his desire to raise the bar. The\nmetal beneath yielded slightly--but he felt the palms of his hands\nbruise against the lever.\n\nOnly after he dropped the bar did he realize the force he had exerted.\nHis hands ached and tingled. His strength must have been increased\ntremendously. With his plastic coat wrapped around the lever, he tried\nagain. The metal of the scout bottom gave slowly--until the fuel pump\nhung free!\n\nKaiser did not repair the tube immediately. He let the solution\nrest in his hands, like a package to be opened, the pleasure of its\nanticipation to be enjoyed as much as the final act.\n\nHe transmitted the news of what he had been able to do and sat down to\nread the two messages waiting for him.\n\nThe first was quite routine:\n\n    REPORTS FROM THE OCTOPUS INDICATE THAT BIG MUDDY UNDERGOES RADICAL\n    WEATHER-CYCLE CHANGES DURING SPRING AND FALL SEASONS, FROM EXTREME\n    MOISTURE TO EXTREME ARIDITY. AT HEIGHT OF DRY SEASON, PLANET MUST\n    BE COMPLETELY DEVOID OF SURFACE LIQUID.\n\n    TO SURVIVE THESE UNUSUAL EXTREMES, SEAL-PEOPLE WOULD NEED EXTREME\n    ADAPTABILITY. THIS VERIFIES OUR EARLIER GUESS THAT NATIVES HAVE\n    SYMBIOSIS WITH THE SAME VIRUS FORM THAT INVADED YOU. WITH\n    SYMBIOTES' AID, SUCH RADICAL PHYSICAL CHANGE COULD BE POSSIBLE.\n    WILL KEEP YOU INFORMED.\n\n    GIVE US ANY NEW INFORMATION YOU MIGHT HAVE ON NATIVES.\n\n    SS II\n\nThe second report was not so routine. Kaiser thought he detected a note\nof uneasiness in it.\n\n    SUGGEST YOU DEVOTE ALL TIME AND EFFORT TO REPAIR OF SCOUT.\n    INFORMATION ON SEAL-PEOPLE ADEQUATE FOR OUR PURPOSES.\n\n    SS II\n\nKaiser did not answer either communication. His earlier report had\ncovered all that he had learned lately. He lay on his cot and went to\nsleep.\n\nIn the morning, another message was waiting:\n\n    VERY PLEASED TO HEAR OF PROGRESS ON REPAIR OF SCOUT. COMPLETE AS\n    QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND RETURN HERE IMMEDIATELY.\n\n    SS II\n\n\n\nKaiser wondered about the abrupt recall. Could the _Soscites II_ be\nexperiencing some difficulty? He shrugged the thought aside. If they\nwere, they would have told him. The last notes had had more than just a\nsuggestion of urgency--there appeared to be a deliberate concealing of\ninformation.\n\nStrangely, the messages indicated need for haste did not prod Kaiser.\nHe knew now that the job could be done, perhaps in a few hours' time.\nAnd the _Soscites II_ would not complete its orbit of the planet for\ntwo weeks yet.\n\nWithout putting on more than the shirt and trousers he had grown used\nto wearing, Kaiser went outside and wandered listlessly about the\nvicinity of the ship for several hours. When he became hungry, he went\nback inside.\n\nAnother message came in as he finished eating. This one was from the\ncaptain himself:\n\n    WHY HAVE WE RECEIVED NO VERIFICATION OF LAST INSTRUCTIONS? REPAIR\n    SCOUT IMMEDIATELY AND RETURN WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY. THIS IS AN\n    ORDER!\n\n    H. A. HESSE, CAPT.\n\nKaiser pushed the last of his meal--which he had been eating with his\nfingers--into his mouth, crumpled the tape, wiped the grease from his\nhands with it and dropped it to the floor.\n\nHe pondered mildly, as he packed his equipment, why he was disregarding\nthe captain's message. For some reason, it seemed too trivial for\nserious consideration. He placated his slightly uneasy conscience only\nto the extent of packing the communicator in with his other equipment.\nIt was a self-contained unit and he'd be able to receive messages from\nthe ship on his trip.\n\n\n\nThe tracks of his earlier journey had been erased by the soft rain, and\nwhen Kaiser reached the river, he found that he had not returned to\nthe village he had visited the day before. However, there were other\nseal-people here.\n\nAnd they were almost human!\n\nThe resemblance was still not so much in their physical makeup--that\nwas little changed from the first he had found--as in their obviously\ngreater intelligence.\n\nThis was mainly noticeable in their facile expressions as they talked.\nKaiser was even certain that he read smiles on their faces when he\nslipped on a particularly slick mud patch as he hurried toward them.\nWhere the members of the first tribes had all looked almost exactly\nalike, these had very marked individual characteristics. Also, these\nhad no odor--only a mild, rather pleasing scent. When they came to meet\nhim, Kaiser could detect distinct syllabism in their pipings.\n\nMost of the natives returned to the river after the first ten minutes\nof curious inspection, but two stayed behind as Kaiser set up his tent.\n\nOne was a female.\n\nThey made small noises while he went about his work. After a time, he\nunderstood that they were trying to give names to his paraphernalia. He\ntried saying \"tent\" and \"wire\" and \"tarp\" as he handled each object,\nbut their piping voices could not repeat the words. Kaiser amused\nhimself by trying to imitate their sounds for the articles. He was\nfairly successful. He was certain that he could soon learn enough to\ncarry on a limited conversation.\n\nThe male became bored after a time and left, but the girl stayed until\nKaiser finished. She motioned to him then to follow. When they reached\nthe river bank, he saw that she wanted him to go into the water.\n\n\n\nBefore he had time to decide, Kaiser heard the small bell of the\ncommunicator from the tent behind him. He stood undecided for a moment,\nthen returned and read the message on the tape:\n\n    STILL ANXIOUSLY AWAITING WORD FROM YOU.\n\n    IN MEANTIME, GIVE VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO FOLLOWING.\n\n    WE KNOW THAT THE SYMBIOTES MUST BE ABLE TO MAKE RADICAL CHANGES IN\n    THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE SEAL-PEOPLE. THERE IS EVERY PROBABILITY THAT\n    YOURS WILL ATTEMPT TO DO THE SAME TO YOU--TO BETTER FIT YOUR BODY\n    TO ITS PRESENT ENVIRONMENT.\n\n    THE DANGER, WHICH WE HESITATED TO MENTION UNTIL NOW--WHEN YOU HAVE\n    FORCED US BY YOUR OBSTINATE SILENCE--IS THAT IT CAN ALTER YOUR\n    MIND ALSO. YOUR REPORT ON SECOND TRIBE OF SEAL-PEOPLE STRONGLY\n    INDICATES THAT THIS IS ALREADY HAPPENING. THEY WERE PROBABLY NOT\n    MORE INTELLIGENT AND HUMANLIKE THAN THE OTHERS. ON THE CONTRARY,\n    YOU ARE BECOMING MORE LIKE THEM.\n\n    DANGER ACUTE. RETURN IMMEDIATELY. REPEAT: IMMEDIATELY!\n\n    SS II\n\nKaiser picked up a large rock and slowly, methodically pounded the\ncommunicator into a flattened jumble of metal and loose parts.\n\nWhen he finished, he returned to the waiting girl on the river bank.\nShe pointed at his plastic trousers and made laughing sounds in her\nthroat. Kaiser returned the laugh and stripped off the trousers. They\nran, still laughing, into the water.\n\nAlready the long pink hair that had been growing on his body during the\npast week was beginning to turn brown at the roots.",
