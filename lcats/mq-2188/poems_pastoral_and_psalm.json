trial, every care,\n      Thy patient footsteps may we see;\n    The sorrows of thy cross to share\n      Shall then our joy and glory be.\n\n    Secure in thy unchanging love,\n      No toil, no suffering will we flee,\n    Assured that death itself shall prove\n      The path that leads to heaven and thee.\n\n\n\n\n     CHRISTUS CONSOLATOR.\n\n\n    In the day of tribulation,\n    In the hour of sore temptation,\n    With the strength of thy salvation,\n      Jesus, Saviour, comfort me.\n\n    When no more the heart may borrow\n    Hope and courage from the morrow,--\n    In the darkest depths of sorrow,\n      Jesus, Saviour, comfort me.\n\n    When all aid is unavailing,\n    Flesh and heart together failing,\n    Sin and death the soul assailing,--\n      Jesus, Saviour, comfort me.\n\n    On thy word alone relying,--\n    Never thy dear name denying,--\n    O, forsake me not when dying!\n      Jesus, Saviour, comfort me.\n\n    Crowned, at last, in light supernal,\n    Victor over foes infernal,--\n    With thy love, supreme, eternal,\n      Jesus, Saviour, comfort me.\n\n\n\n\n     HOLY SPIRIT, HEAVENLY GUEST!\n\n\n    Holy Spirit, heavenly Guest,\n    Make thy home within my breast;\n    Yearns for thee my weary heart,--\n    Come, and nevermore depart.\n\n    Where thou dwellest peace abides,--\n    Grace surpassing all besides,--\n    Priceless treasure, pure and blest,\n    Earnest of eternal rest.\n\n    God\u2019s dear will be done in me\n    Even as it pleaseth thee;\n    Only let me fully prove\n    The sweet comfort of thy love.\n\n    Cheerfully, for Jesus\u2019 sake,\n    May I every burden take,--\n    Glad to trace the pathway trod\n    By the suffering Son of God.\n\n    Blessed Comforter and Guide,\n    Keep me near the Saviour\u2019s side,\n    Till I in his likeness rise,\n    Crowned with bliss beyond the skies.\n\n\n\n\n     HOLY SPIRIT, LIGHT DIVINE!\n\n\n    Holy Spirit, Light divine!\n    On our souls in mercy shine;\n    Gates of heaven again unfold;--\n    Haste, for Time is waxing old.\n\n    On the Church of Jesus shower\n    All thy plenitude of power;\n    Heal earth\u2019s bitterness and strife\n    With the Saviour\u2019s love and life.\n\n    Over all created things\n    Brooded, once, thy bless\u00e8d wings;\n    Groans the world with grief and pain\n    Dove divine! descend again.\n\n\n\n\n      \u201cTHE DAY OF CHRIST.\u201d\n\n\n      The Son of man will come,--\n        His promise cannot fail;\n      The royal Conqueror\n        Shall over all prevail;\n    And Earth shall hear his summons dread,\n    And Death and Hell give up their dead.\n\n      Ten thousand thousand saints\n        His coming shall attend,--\n      And underneath his feet\n        The firmament shall rend;\n    And, prostrate at his judgment throne,\n    The world his sovereignty shall own.\n\n      O Son of Mary! hear\n        A helpless sinner\u2019s prayer,\n      And, on that awful day,\n        Make me thy gracious care;\n    O, be my heart\u2019s sure hope and stay\n    When the wide heavens shall flee away.\n\n      Keep faithful watch, my soul,\n        And pray \u201cThy kingdom come;\u201d\n      But leave it all to Him,\n        How he shall bring thee home;\n    The resurrection of the just\n    Shall recompense thy patient trust.\n\n\n\n\n     THE CONSUMMATION.\n\n\n    O Saviour, whose surpassing grace\n      Exceeds the guilt thy griefs atoned,\n    The praises of a ransomed race\n      Be thine, in highest heaven enthroned.\n\n    The Father\u2019s everlasting love\n      Thy blessed life and death declare;\n    And still, though crowned with bliss above,\n      Our deepest sorrows thou dost share.\n\n    O Jesus, merciful and kind,\n      The sad and sinful seek thy breast;\n    Our souls in thee their solace find,--\n      Our refuge thou, our only rest.\n\n    The goal is sure, O Guide divine!\n      Again the stars of morning sing;\n    All wills, all worlds, at last are thine,\n      O Christ, Creator, Saviour, King!\n\n\n\n\n     ALL SAINTS.\n\n\n    Ten thousand times ten thousand,--\n      Their shining ranks I see!\n    With robes of light resplendent,\n      And palms of victory!\n\n    The crowns they wear are golden,\n      And gemmed with jewels rare,--\n    Fair guerdon of the glory\n      They with their Saviour share.\n\n    Their home--the holy city,\n      Within whose ageless walls\n    No shade of sin, or sickness,\n      Or sorrow, ever falls;\n    For _He_ is ever with them,\n      The Lamb, their life, their light,--\n    The joy of all the ransomed,\n      The saints\u2019 supreme delight.\n\n    Dear vision of the bless\u00e8d--\n      How homelike heaven seems!\n    Sweet foretaste of the rapture\n      Exceeding all our dreams.\n    O Jesus, Shepherd, Saviour,\n      My guide and guardian be,\n    And bring me, through thy favor,\n      To dwell with them and thee.\n\n\n\n\n     OUR LIFE IS LENT.\n\n\n    Our life is Lent:\n    Our years are spent\n      In penance for the past;\n    Our songs are sighs,\n    Our brightest skies\n      With clouds are overcast.\n\n    Our life is Lent:\n    The old lament--\n      \u201cAll, all is vanity;\u201d\n    And Youth, in tears,\n    Awaits with fears\n      The morrow\u2019s mystery.\n\n    Our life is Lent:\n    Lord, we repent\n      Each folly, fault, and fall;\n    Our best resolve\n    Do thou absolve,--\n      Forgive, forget it all.\n\n    Our life is Lent:\n    Our hearts are rent,\n      As we thy gifts recount,\n    And mark again,\n    With bitter pain,\n      \u201cThe pattern in the mount.\u201d\n\n    Our life is Lent:\n    Our strength is spent;\n      O holy Judge, and just,\n    Receive our prayer,--\n    Poor sinners spare;\n      Remember we are dust!\n\n    Our life is Lent:\n    But Jesus went\n      This way; in him confide;\n    \u2019Twill soon be past;\n    Then, for thy fast,\n      _Eternal Easter-tide!_\n\n\n\n\n     IT DOTH NOT YET APPEAR.\n\n\n    \u201cIt doth not yet appear what we shall be;\u201d\n      The goal, the crown, but dimly we discern,--\n    For evermore from sin and sorrow free,\n      In that blest world for which we often yearn.\n\n    \u201cIt doth not yet appear what we shall be;\u201d\n      Eye hath not seen, nor was it ever told--\n    The height of honor we shall share with Thee,\n      Enthroned in light and rapture manifold.\n\n    \u201cIt doth not yet appear what we shall be,\u201d--\n      Redeemed from death and glorified above;\n    Enough, dear Lord, that we shall be like thee,\n      In that eternal life of cloudless love.\n\n\n\n\n     THE RAINBOW ROUND THE THRONE.\n\n\n    The sunshine and the shadow--alternately they flow\n    Across the fields of ether, across our hearts below;\n    The gloom and glory blending in beauty manifold,\n    The mists of morning ending in evening\u2019s gates of gold.\n\n    Forever and forever our human lives are so--\n    The sunshine and the shadow, alternate weal and woe;\n    Perpetually ascending, earth\u2019s mingled mirth and moan,--\n    But lo! above us bending, the rainbow round the throne!\n\n    Hold fast the heavenly vision; this hope thy soul sustain--\n    All things shall work together for thy eternal gain;\n    The mystery of sorrow, the mystery of pain,\n    Shall sure, some happy morrow, to every heart be plain.",
