vision.\n\nThrough a turbid town,\nA great man walks.\nThrough a troubled town,\nA great man talks.\n\nHe tells tales of bravery.\nOn attention he feeds.\nWith speech most savory\nHe boasts of great deeds.\n\nHe is well respected.\nHe enjoys much recognition.\nHe hopes to be selected\nFor a prestigious position.\n\nHe likes to be seen.\nHe likes to be heard.\nWhen he is on the scene,\nHe fills the air with word.\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\nAs greatness is a need\nThis need is his fate.\nHe is as great indeed,\nAs his need to feel great.\n\nOne day as he was walking,\nHe happened to overhear\nTwo girls that were talking.\nHe turned his curious ear.\n\nAs their words he overheard,\nHe felt his aid was required.\nAlways attracted to the spoken word\nTo the girls he inquired,\n\nWhy do you girls carry on\nIn such a vociferous way?\nTo you my attention is drawn\nUpon this beautiful day!!!\n\nAnd to him the him girls inquired,\nWhere does the sun go at night?\nHe knew an answer was required.\nBut he knew not what was right.\n\nWhere it goes, he could not say\nAs he covertly looked about.\nBeing a master of delay,\nHe calmly searched for an out.\n\nA man was passing by\nAnd overheard this conversation.\nHe thought he could supply,\nA goodly explanation.\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\nDetails of this man are unknown\nFor he lived a life withdrawn.\nHe prefers to be quiet and alone.\nA common life he has forgone.\n\nYou see, he was not like you and me.\nHis methods were strange and new.\nA different world his eyes would see.\nA world in which others would have no clue.\n\nDespite his odd looks.\nHe is more then he appears.\nHe has read many books,\nYet still wet behind the ears.\n\nEvery culture to its own will conform.\nThe mind of the crowd is a shallow creek.\nAs this man was far from the norm,\nHe was seen by the people as a freak.\n\nHe values his peace.\nHe is devoted to thought.\nThis is his release.\nNothing finer could be bought.\n\nAs peace is a need\nThis need is his fate.\nAttempting to run from greed,\nOn simplicity he would concentrate.\n\nHe never felt the peace\nThat he needed to feel.\nHe would never cease\nTo search for whats real.\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\nIf work was completed\nAccording to plan,\nIt should not be repeated\nBy a frustrated man.\n\nThe only exception\nFor such repetition\nIs the struggle for perfection,\nOr the folly of a politician.\n\nWhen he did a deed,\nWhen he found satisfaction,\nHe could see no need\nFor any further action.\n\nIf nothing was there broken\nOr no deed to be done,\nNo answer to be spoken,\nThen action was there none.\n\nIf there is no disruption\nAnd everything seems in balance,\nWasteful action is corruption\nOf the purest talents.\n\nA problem of complexity\nNeeds a simple solution.\nA mind in perplexity\nIs lost in convolution.\n\nNow for the girls question,\nHe felt he knew, really.\nHe had a suggestion,\nAnd he offered it freely.\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\nA weary sun will hide\nTo give a new night birth.\nThe sun then goes to the other side\nOf our blessed Mother Earth.\n\nThe problem seemed to be solved.\nThe great man saw this.\nHe went to get involved.\nFor attention he could not miss.\n\nThe freaks words had merit.\nAn advantage had been gained,\nBut the great man could not bear it.\nHis status must be maintained.\n\nThe freaks words he twisted\nWith his eloquent speech.\nHis charisma could not be resisted.\nIt was he who would teach.\n\nHe took the freaks idea\nAnd made it his own.\nNo man would be right\nExcept he alone.\n\nHe devised his own story\nUsing the freaks word.\nHe would take the glory\nAnd make the freak seem absurd.\n\nHe is not entirely correct.\nThe great man thus began.\nI mean no disrespect\nBut I am, of course, a great man!\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\nHe was on the right track.\nThis I wont deny.\nWhat truth may he lack,\nI will attempt to supply.\n\nHe does not know, it seems,\nThat our grateful relation\nTo the Suns warm beams\nLies in the Earths rotation.\n\nIf you but wait,\nThis problem I will solve.\nUpon its axis straight,\nDoes the Earth revolve.\n\nAs our great God\nIs wont to create,\nUpon this imaginary rod\nDoes the Earth rotate.\n\nThe sun remains still\nWhile the Earth moves and spins\nWhere the suns warmth may fill\nA new day on Earth begins.\n\nJust as the moon is the reason\nFor waves in the ocean\nThe change of the season\nIs the Earth in Her motion.\n\nIt is basic science.\nThe sun could never hide.\nOur Earth is in complete reliance\nOf the Sun on every side.\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\nThe girls were amazed\nAt this great display of speech.\nInto the great mans eyes they gazed\nAs he proceeded to teach.\n\nA lesson he had taught\nNot unlike a story compiled\nFrom a borrowed thought\nWith its author left reviled.\n\nThe freak was appalled\nWatching innocence beguiled.\nThe girls were enthralled\nWhile the great man smiled.\n\nWho was being deceived?\nThe freak felt some dismay.\nThe great man the girls believed.\nAnd the freak just walked away.\n\nIt seemed childish to contest.\nHe saw no reason to fight.\nHe thought best not to protest.\nBoth of their answers were right.\n\nOver time the great man grew\nTo earn a great mans reputation.\nHis words would cause much ado\nAnd even some speculation.\n\nA few weeks quickly went by\nDuring which time came a threat.\nNo rain had fallen from the sky,\nBut the ground seemed to be wet.\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\nWater trickled like blood from a gash.\nSoon the streets turned to mud.\nPeople could not walk without a splash.\nThere was fear that the town would flood.\n\nSlowly, this problem would develop.\nThe water would continue to run.\nEventually, the whole town it would envelop\nIf something was not soon done.\n\nWater does not feel sorrow nor care\nWherever it trickles and roams.\nThe people were becoming more aware,\nFor it was soon in their homes.\n\nTo the great man the people went\nFor some kind of solution.\nThere must be a way to prevent\nAny further ground dilution.\n\nThe great man promised thus,\nTo you I can assure,\nFor any problem threatening us\nFor sure there is a cure!\n\nI will stop this silly little flood.\nUpon the great man you can rely.\nThe ground may be covered in mud\nBut, somewhere, must a solution lie!\n\nIn his office the great man sat\nStaring at the water on the floor.\nHe knew not how to deal with that,\nBut he knew there would be more.\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\nDesperately trying to think of a plan\nHe repeatedly read the plaque on the wall,\nHere is a Great Man\nHe will save us all!\n\nThe sparkling water had a sense of beauty\nAs it reflected in the plaque.\nA painful reminder of his duty,\nA leader must never slack.\n\nSo, eagerly, he donned his heavy boots,\nAnd ventured forth for a walk\nThrough a series of muddy routes,\nFor to the people he must talk.\n\nThe great man noticed one man solitary\nAs he trekked a turbid trail.\nTo the woods with buckets he did carry\nIn a struggling effort his home to bail.\n\nThough his face he could not see,\nHe knew that this man to be clever and brave.\nHe could not dwell on who it could be\nFor the great man had a town to save.\n\nHe thought of the people as his duty required\nTo give them this instruction.\nBy this sight he was inspired\nTo save the town from destruction.\n\nTogether we must pull!\nThis I must accent!\nSo each man scooped a bucket full\nAnd into the woods with the water they went.\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\nSoon this method had no effect.\nThe water continued to rise.\nThe people were beginning to suspect,\nThis is not where the solution lies.\n\nThe great man saw this method would fail\nBut he knew he must not quit.\nAgain he trekked the turbid trail\nTo this problem he did commit.\n\nThen the great man saw a lone man dig\nA trench in which the water would drop.\nHe dug it deep and he dug it big.\nPerhaps, in this trench, the water would stop!\n\nHe thought of the people, as his duty required\nTo give them this instruction.\nBy this site he was again inspired\nTo save the town from destruction.\n\nWe must dig a great ditch\nIn which the water will drop.\nInto this we all must pitch\nIf the water we are to stop!\n\nA solution to this we must seek.\nLook to me in your time of need.\nThough the situation may now look bleak,\nWe will succeed with my lead!\n\nUpon his shoulder, he felt a hand.\nIt was, in fact, the odd man.\nThe great man, at first, did not understand.\nThen the freak thus began,\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\nYou may be great and the people strong,\nBut this wont stop the waters force.\nThis will not work for very long.\nWe must stop it at the source.\n\nThe great man let out a great big laugh,\nAnd to the odd man he talked down.\nYou think you can speak on the peoples behalf?\nA great man must save this town!\nWe all share the same concern.\nYour offer I do appreciate,\nHowever, to experience, we must now turn.\nThis issue is too great.\n\nAs the great man continued to give his speech\nThe freak had turned and walked away.\nA solution soon someone must reach\nNo matter what the great man would say.\n\nSoon the town will certainly be\nJust a huge pool of mud.\nIt is not really hard to see\nThat nothing is stopping this great flood.\n\nHis mind was cloudy and his feet were muddy.\nWhile the great man talked and talked,\nThe freak used this time to think and study,\nSo in search of the source he walked.\n\nThe freak followed the water alone.\nDeep into the woods he was led.\nThere he found a slab of stone.\nOn the stone it read,\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\nIn the event of a flood\nThis lesson should be learned\nUnless you like to live in mud,\nThe valve must be turned.\n\nBelow these words there was an arrow\nAnd it was pointing to the creek.\nThe creek had begun to overflow.\nThis was, no doubt, the source of the leak.\n\nThe freak was indeed happy to learn\nHow the flood had been produced.\nHe found the valve and gave it a turn.\nAnd the water immediately was reduced.\n\nHe went back up the muddy trail\nAnd told the people what he had done.\nBut no one would believe his tale,\nNot a single, solitary one.\n\nAfraid of being deceived,\nThe people showed only doubt,\nWhy should he be believed?\nWhat is he all about?\n\nSkepticism and emotion\nWere sparked by the freaks word.\nHis story caused quite a commotion,\nAnd the great man, of course, overheard.\nHe said, I will solve this dispute.\nWhatever the problem, there must be a plan.\nOf the truth, we are in pursuit.\nA great problem requires a great man!\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\nId like a word, please come with me,\nTo the freak the great man said.\nThe freak complied with his plea.\nTo the great mans office he was led.\n\nOnce in his office, he closed the door.\nHe could not wait to ask,\nWhat did you do, I want to hear more,\nAbout how you pursued this task.\n\nAs the freak began to describe\nThe valve at the creek and slab of stone.\nThe great man was not willing to subscribe\nTo this story by a man who lives alone.\n\nThe great man was in disbelief.\nHe began to give the freak a speech.\nHis talk was not short, nor was it brief.\nTo the freak, a lesson he would teach.\n\nHe told the freak about being great,\nAnd that by his word he would rule.\nBeing a master at debate,\nHe made the freak look like a fool.\n\nFrom the office the freak went,\nStuck on the words the great man had said.\nHe walked the path back home in resent,\nAs the great mans voice he heard in his head.\n\nIts obvious that the town is his.\nHe could hear the people as he walked through.\nWho in the world does he think he is?\nHe thinks he is a great man too!\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\nThe farther he walked the angrier he became,\nTo think that words could outshine skill.\nGreat man, bah...what a name!\nIll show them all, I will!\n\nInto the forest, he marched in retaliation.\nHe felt the need to settle the score.\nHe could not bear this indignation.\nThis town was not his home anymore.\n\nHe found again the slab of stone.\nHe found again the valve by the creek.\nNever before had he felt so alone.\nRevenge now did he seek.\n\nIn his anger, he turned the valve back.\nThe water began to overflow.\nHe thought, for a moment, about this attack.\nThen he decided the people must know.\n\nOn the way back, he felt some guilt.\nHis conscience was big and his mind was young.\nUpon action his existence was built.\nOnce back in town, he held his tongue.\n\nThe town again began to flood.\nAnd the people again began to worry.\nThe ground again had turned to mud.\nTo their buckets again the people would hurry.\n\nThe efforts again the great man would direct,\nBut an effort repeated is a lesson taught.\nSoon the bucket method had no effect,\nAnd this sent the great man into thought.\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\nThe man with the bucket, he only saw from afar.\nAnd the man in the trench, never showed his face.\nHe began to feel that this was bizarre,\nAnd then this pattern, he began to trace.\n\nThese men were indeed one and the same!\nThe great man was struck with revelation.\nThis peculiar freak, with no name,\nHad been the source of his inspiration!\n\nHe headed down the muddy trail,\nInto the forest he would withdraw.\nThere he dropped his water pale.\nHe could not believe what he saw.\n\nThere he found a slab of stone\nJust as the freak had said.\nHe wondered how this could go unknown\nAs the words on the stone he read,\n\nIn the event of a flood\nThis lesson should be learned\nUnless you like to live in mud,\nThe valve must be turned.\n\nBelow these words there was an arrow\nAnd it was pointing to the creek.\nThe creek had begun to overflow.\nNo doubt this was the source of the leak.\n\nThe great man was indeed happy to learn\nHow the flood had been produced.\nHe found the valve and gave it a turn.\nAnd the water immediately was reduced.\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\nHe went back up the muddy trail,\nAnd told the people what he had done.\nThe people all gathered to hear his tale,\nAnd all were intrigued, but one.\n\nKnowledge is power, the great man began.\nA man who knows power is a man who is wise.\nThe greater the problem, the greater the man\nWho can find the answer thats little in size.\n\nGreat men do heroic deeds.\nOver the common men they tower.\nGreat men are what this town needs...\nMen who face danger, and do not cower.\n\nI am a great man, but a hero am I?\nThats a title I cannot claim.\nThere are those whose talent we may deny,\nBut they are heroes just the same.\n\nAs they heard those words so profound,\nThe people hailed the great man and cheered.\nThe freak looked down at the ground.\nHe knew to them he would always seem weird.\n\nThe girls who argued about the sun walked by.\nThey offered him words so sweet,\nYoure a nice man, theres no need to cry.\nHes a great man, and he cant be beat.\n\nThe freak looked at the girls and smiled.\nHe could see that a leader is all they need.\nIts noble to protect the innocence of a child.\nYes, he said, He is a great man indeed.\n\nThe End",
