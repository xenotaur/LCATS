    "body": "The man ahead of me had a dragon in his baggage. So the Lamavic boys\nconfiscated it. Lamavic--Livestock, Animal, Mineral and Vegetable,\nInternational Customs--does not like to find dragons curled up in a\nthermos. And since this antipathy was a two-way exchange, the Lamavic\ninspectors at Philadelphia International were singed and heated all\nways by the time they got to me. I knew them well.\n\n\"Mr. Sol Jones?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" I said, watching the would-be dragon smuggler being\nmarched away. A very amateur job. I could have told him. There are only\ntwo ways to smuggle a dragon nowadays.\n\n\"Any livestock to declare, Mr. Jones?\"\n\n\"I have no livestock on my person or in my baggage, nor am I\naccompanied by any material prohibited article,\" I said carefully, for\nI saw they were recording.\n\nThe little pink, bald inspector with a charred collar looked at his\ncolleague.\n\n\"Anything known?\"\n\nHis colleague looked down at me from six feet of splendid physique,\nsmiled unpleasantly, and flipped the big black record book.\n\n\"'Sol Jones,'\" he read, \"'Lamavic four-star offender. Galactic\nregistration: six to tenth power: 763918. Five foot ten inches, Earth\nscale. Blue eyes, hair variable and usually nondescript brown, ear\nlobes and cranial....' You're not disputing identity, Mr. Jones?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. That's me.\"\n\n\"I see. 'Irrevocable Galactic citizenship for services to family\nof Supreme President Xgol in matter of asteroid fungus, subsequent\nSenatorial amnesty confirmed, previous sentences therefore omitted.\nLamavic offenses thereafter include no indictable evidence but total\ntwenty-four minor fines for introducing prohibited livestock onto\nvarious planets. Suspected complicity in Lamavic cases One through\nSeventy-six as follows: mobile sands, crystal thinkers, recording\nturtle, operatic fish, giant mastodon.' Mr. Jones, you seem to have\ngiven us trouble before.\"\n\n\"Before what?\"\n\n\"Before this--er--\"\n\n\"That,\" I said, \"is an Unconstitutional remark. I am giving no trouble.\nI have made a full declaration. I demand the rights of a Galactic\ncitizen.\"\n\nHe apologized, as he had to. This merely made both inspectors angry,\nbut they were going to search me anyway. I knew that. Certainly I am a\nsmuggler, and I had in fact a little present for my girl Florence--a\nwedding present, I hoped--but they would never find it. This time I\nreally had them fooled, and I intended to extract maximum pleasure from\nwatching their labors.\n\n\n\nI saw the Lamavic records once. The next leading offender has only\ntwo stars and he's out on Ceres in the penal colony. My four stars\ndenote that I disapprove of all these rules prohibiting the carrying\nof livestock from one planet to another. Other people extend the\nGalactic Empire; I extend my Galactic credit. You want an amusing\nextraterrestrial pet to while away the two-hour work week, I can\nprovide one. Of course, this pet business was overdone in the early\ndays when any space-hopper could bring little foreign monsters back to\nthe wife and kiddies. Any weird thing could come in and did.\n\n\"You are aware, Mr. Jones, that you have declared that you are not\ntrying to bring in any prohibited life-form, whether animal, mineral,\nvegetable, or any or all of these?\"\n\n\"I am,\" I said.\n\n\"You are further aware of the penalties for a false declaration?\"\n\n\"In my case, I believe I could count on thirty years' invigorating work\non a penal planet.\"\n\n\"You could, Mr. Jones. You certainly could.\"\n\n\"Well, I've made my declaration.\"\n\n\"Will you step this way?\"\n\nVery polite in Philadelphia Spaceport. I followed the inspectors into\nthe screening cubicles. There was a nasty looking device in the corner.\n\n\"I thought those things were illegal,\" I said.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Mr. Jones, you are, as you know, quite right. We may\nnot employ a telepath instrument on any unconvicted person.\"\n\nThey looked sorry, but I wasn't. A telepath would have told them\nimmediately where I had Florence's pet, and all about it. I smiled at\nthem. They paid no attention, took my passport and began turning up the\nLamavic manual on Antimony IX, Livestock of, Prohibited Forms. I had\njust come from there and so had Florence's little diver, which I had\nbrought as a happy surprise. I sat down. The two inspectors looked as\nif they were going to say something, then continued flipping pages of\ntheir manual.\n\n\"Here it is--Antimony IX.\"\n\nOne of them read out the prohibitions and the other tried to watch me\nand the reflex counter behind me at the same time--a crude instrument\nwhich should be used, in my professional view, only to determine a\nperson's capacities for playing poker with success.\n\n\"Ants-water, babblers, bunces, candelabra plants, catchem-fellers,\nCythia Majoris, divers, dunces, dimple-images, drakes, dunking dogs,\ndogs-savage, dogs-water, dogs-not-otherwise-provided-for, unspec.,\nelephants-miniature, fish-any....\"\n\nThey went on. Antimony IX is teeming with life and almost every\nspecimen is prohibited on other planets. We had passed the divers,\nanyway. I smiled and gave the reflex counter a strong jerk just as the\nsmaller inspector was saying \"Mammoths.\" They looked at me in silence.\n\n\"Funny man,\" one said, and they went on reading.\n\n\"Okay,\" the large inspector said at last. \"We'll examine him for\neverything.\"\n\n\n\nFor the next three hours, they took blood specimens to see if I had\nmicroscopic livestock hidden there, they X-rayed me and my baggage,\nfluoroscoped everything again, put the baggage through an irritator\nlife-indexer, investigated my orifices in detail with a variety of\ninstruments, took skin scrapings in case I was wearing a false layer,\nand the only thing they found was my dark glasses.\n\n\"Why don't you wear modern contact lenses?\"\n\n\"It's none of your business,\" I said, \"but these old-style spectacles\nhave liquid lenses.\"\n\nThere was a flurry and they sent away for analysis a small drop from\none of the lenses. There were no signs of prohibited life in the liquid.\n\n\"I could have told you that,\" I said. \"It's dicyanin, a vegetable\nextract. Diminishes the glare.\"\n\nI put the glasses on my nose and hooked on the earpieces. The effect\nwas medieval, but I could see the little diver now. I could also see\ndisturbing evidence of the inspectors' mental condition. A useful\nlittle device invented by Dr. W. J. Kilner (1847-1920) for the study of\nthe human aura in sickness and health. After a little practice, which\nI was not going to allow the Lamavic inspectors, the retina became\nsufficiently sensitive to see the micro-wave aura when you looked\nthrough the dicyanin screen. As was true of most of these psi pioneers\nat that time, nothing was done to further Kilner's work when he died.\nI noticed, without surprise, that the inspectors had a mental field of\nvery limited extent and that the little diver had survived the journey\nnicely.\n\n\"Can I go now?\" I asked.\n\n\"This time, Mr. Jones.\"\n\nWhen I left, the repair staff was building a new inspection barrier\nto replace the parts the dragon had got. Such an amateur performance!\nLeave smuggling to professionals and we'd have Lamavic disbanded from\nboredom in ten years. I nearly slipped on the fine silica dioxide which\nhad fused in the air when the dragon got annoyed. Nasty, dangerous pets.\n\nThe one for Florence was the only contraband I was carrying this\ntrip, which was purely pleasure. She was waiting for me in her\napartment, tall, golden, luscious, and all mine. She thought I was in\nimport-export, which in a sense was true.\n\n\"I've missed you so much, Sol,\" she said, twining herself on me and the\ncouch like a Venusian water-nymph. \"Did you bring me a present?\"\n\nI lay back and let her kiss me.\n\n\"Of course I did. A small but very valuable present.\"\n\nI let her kiss me again.\n\n\"Not--a Jupiter diamond, Sol?\"\n\n\"Much rarer than that, and more useful.\"\n\n\"Oh. Useful.\"\n\n\"Something to help you in the house when we're married, honey. Now,\ndon't pout so prettily, or I'll never get around to showing you.\"\n\nMy homecoming was not developing quite as I planned, but I put this\ndown to womanly, if not exactly maidenly, quirks. When she found out\nwhat I had brought her, I was sure she would be all over me again. I\nput on my dark glasses so that I could see where the diver was.\n\n\"Would you like a drink, honey?\" I asked.\n\n\"I don't mind,\" she said sulkily.\n\n\n\nI looked at the diver, concentrated hard on the thought of a bottle\nfrom the cabinet, two glasses and a pitcher of ice from the kitchen. He\nwent revolving through the air obediently and the items came floating\nout neatly. Florence nearly shattered the windows with her screams.\n\n\"Now calm down, honey,\" I said, catching her. \"Calm down. It's just a\nlittle present I brought you.\"\n\nThe bottle, glasses and pitcher dropped gently onto the table beside us.\n\n\"See?\" I said. \"Service at a thought. Remote control. The end of\nhousework. Kiss me.\"\n\nShe didn't.\n\n\"You mean you did that, Sol?\"\n\n\"Not me, exactly. I've brought you a little baby diver, honey, all the\nway from Antimony IX, just for you. There isn't another one on Earth.\nIn fact, I doubt if there's another one outside Antimony IX. I had a\nlot of trouble securing this rare and valuable present for you.\"\n\n\"I don't like it. It gives me the creeps.\"\n\n\"Honey,\" I said carefully, \"this is a little baby. It couldn't hurt a\nmouse. It's about six inches in diameter, and all it is doing is to\nteleport what you want it to teleport.\"\n\n\"Then why can't I see it?\"\n\n\"If you could see it, I wouldn't have been allowed to bring it for you,\nhoney, because a whole row of nasty-minded Solar Civil Servants would\nhave seen it too, and they would have taken it from your own sweet Sol.\"\n\n\"They can have it.\"\n\n\"Honey, this is a _rare_ and _valuable_ pet! It will _do_ things for\nyou.\"\n\n\"So you think I need something done for me. Well! I'm glad you came\nright out and said this before we were married!\"\n\nThe following series of \"but--but--\" from me and irrelevance from\nFlorence occupied an hour, but hardly mentioned the diver. Eventually I\ngot her back into my arms.\n\nMy urges for Florence were strictly biological, though intense. There\nwere little chances for intellectual exchanges between us, but I was\nmore interested in the broad probabilities of her as a woman. I could\ngo commune with wild and exotic intelligences on foreign planets any\ntime I had the fare. As a woman, Florence was what I wanted.\n\n\"Back on Antimony IX,\" I explained carefully, \"life is fierce and\nrugged. So, to keep from being eaten, these little divers evolved\nthemselves into little minds with no bodies at all, and they feed off\nsolar radiation. Now, honey, minds are not made of the same stuff\nbrains are made of, good solid tissue and gray matter and neural\ncortex--\"\n\n\"Don't be dirty, Sol.\"\n\n\"There is nothing dirty about the body, honey. Minds are invisible\nbut detectable in the micro-wavelengths on any sensitive counter, and\nlook like little glass eggs when you can see them--as I can, by using\nthese glasses. In fact, your diver is over by the window now. But,\nhaving evolved this far, they came across a little difficulty and\ncouldn't evolve any further. So there they are, handy little minds\nfor teleporting whatever you want moved, and reading other people's\nthoughts.\"\n\n\n\nShe gasped. \"Did you say reading other people's thoughts?\n\n\"Certainly,\" I said. \"As a matter of fact, that's what stopped the\ndivers from evolving further. If they brush against any thinking\ncreature, they pick up whatever thought is in the creature's conscious\nmind. But they also pick up the subliminal activity, if you follow\nme--and down at that level of a mind such as man's, his thoughts are\nnot only the present unconscious thoughts but also a good slice of what\nis to him still the future. It's one of those space-time differences.\nThe divers are not really on the same space-time reference as the\nphysical world, but that makes them all the more useful, because our\nminds aren't either.\"\n\n\"Did you say reading other people's thoughts, like a telepath?\" she\npersisted.\n\n\"Exactly like a telepath, or any other class of psi. We're really\nliving on a much wider scale than we're conscious of, but our mind only\ntracks down one point in time-space in a straight line, which happens\nto fit our bodies. Our subliminal mind is way out in every direction,\nincluding time--and when you pick up fragments of this consciously,\nyou're a psi, that's all. So the divers got thoroughly confused--that's\nwhat it amounts to--and never evolved any further. So you see, honey,\nit's all perfectly natural.\"\n\n\"I think you're just dirty.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"Everyone _hates_ telepaths. You know that.\"\n\n\"I don't.\"\n\n\"Oh, you go wandering all over the Galaxy--but my friends--what could\nI say to my friends if they learned I had something like a telepath in\nthe apartment?\"\n\n\"It's only a baby diver, I keep telling you, honey. And anyway, you'll\nbe able to tell what they're really thinking about you.\"\n\nFlorence looked thoughtful. \"And what they've been doing?\"\n\n\"Sometimes they will do what they think they'll do. And sometimes they\ndon't make it. But it's what their subliminal plans to have happen,\nyes.\"\n\nShe kissed me. \"I think it's a lovely present, Sol.\"\n\nShe snuggled up to me and I concentrated on bringing the diver over to\nher. I thought I'd read her, just for a joke, and see what she had in\nmind. I took a close look.\n\n\"What's the matter, Sol?\"\n\n\"Oh, honey! You beautiful creature!\"\n\n\"This is nice--but what made you say that?\"\n\n\"I just got the diver to show me your mind, and bits of the next two\nweeks you have in mind. It's going to be a lovely, lovely vacation.\"\n\nShe blushed very violently and got angry. \"You had no right to look at\nwhat I was thinking, Sol!\"\n\n\"It wasn't what you were thinking so much as what you will be thinking,\nhoney. I figure in it quite well.\"\n\n\"I won't have it, Sol! Do you hear me? I think spying on people is\ndetestable!\"\n\n\"I thought you liked the idea of tagging your friends?\"\n\n\"That's different. Either we go somewhere without that whatever-it-is,\nor you can marry someone else. I don't mind having it around after\nwe're married, but not before, Sol. Do you understand?\"\n\nI was already reaching for the video yellow pages.\n\n\n\nI turned on the television-wall in the apartment before we left and\ninstructed the diver to stay around and watch it. They are very curious\ncreatures, inquisitive, always chasing new ideas, and I thought that\nshould hold the diver happily for several days. Meanwhile, I had booked\nadjoining rooms at the Asteroid-Central.\n\nThe Asteroid-Central advertised in the video yellow pages that it\npracticed the Most Rigid Discrimination--meaning no telepaths,\nclairvoyants, clairaudients or psychometrists. Life was hard on a psi\noutside Government circles. But life was much harder on the rest of the\nworld seeking secluded privacy and discretion. The Asteroid-Central was\nso discreet, you could hardly see where you were going. Dim lights,\nelegant figures passing in the gloom, singing perfumes of the gentlest\nkind, and \"Guaranteed Psi-Free\" on every bedroom door.\n\nI was humming idly in my room, with one eye on the communicating door\nthrough which, were she but true to her own mind, Florence would\nshortly come, and I turned on the television-wall only to see how\nless fortunate people were spending their leisure. An idle and most\nregrettable gesture.\n\nThere was a quiz-game on International Channel 462, dull and just\nfinishing. All the contestants seemed to know all the answers. In\nfact, the man who won the trip around the Rings of Saturn, did so\nby answering the question before the Martian quiz-master had really\nfinished reading it out. When the winner turned sharply on the other\ncontestants and knocked them down, yelling, \"So that's what you think\nof my mother, is it?\" the wall was blacked out and we were taken\nstraight to the Solar Party Convention.\n\nThe nominee this decade was human. He seemed to be speaking on his\naims, his pure record and altruistic intentions. The stereo cameras\nlooked over the heads of the delegates. Starting in the row by the main\naisle, each delegate shot to his feet and started booing and jeering.\nIt rippled down the rows like a falling pack of cards, each delegate in\nturn after the man in front of him, and each row picking up where the\nback of the previous row left off. It was as if someone were passing a\ngalvanizing brush along the heads of the delegates, row by row.\n\nOr as if a diver were refreshing the delegates with a clear picture of\ntheir nominee's mind.\n\nI groaned and called Florence.\n\n\"Look,\" I said when she came. \"That damned pet has followed the program\nback to the cameras from your apartment, and there he is lousing up the\nConvention.\"\n\n\"I vote Earth,\" she told me indifferently.\n\n\"That isn't the point, honey. I'll have to bring the diver here, and\nquickly.\"\n\n\"You do that, Sol. I'll be at home when you get rid of it.\"\n\nBy the time the diver picked up my thoughts and came flickering into\nthe room through the walls, Florence had left.\n\nI felt the diver off the back of my head, made my thoughts as kindly as\npossible, and went downstairs to the largest, longest bar.\n\n\n\nThe evening passed profitably because I was invited to join a threesome\nof crooks at cards. With the aid of the little diver, I was able to\nshorten the odds to a pleasant margin in my favor. But this was doing\nnothing about Florence. A not altogether funny remark about teleporting\nthe cards did, however, suggest the answer.\n\nAfter the transaction was over, I sent the diver off to a friend on\nthe faculty of Luke University, where they had a long history of psi\ninvestigation and where the diver could be guaranteed to be kept busy\nrolling dice and such. This was easy to fix by a video call. There had\nbeen times in the past when certain services to the Extra-terrestrial\nZoology and Botanical Tanks had made me discreetly popular with the\nfaculty, and anyway they thought I was doing them a favor. They\npromised to keep the little diver busy for an indefinite period.\n\nI reported to Florence, and after a certain amount of feminine\nshall-I-shan't-I, she came back to the Asteroid-Central.\n\nThis time I did not turn on the television-wall. I lay still. I said\nnothing. I hardly thought at all. And after several years compressed\nthemselves into every minute, my own true honey, Florence, slid open\nthe communicating door and came into the room.\n\nShe walked shyly toward me, hiding modestly within a floating nightgown\nas opaque as a very clear soap bubble.\n\nI stood up, held out my arms and she came toward me, smiling--and\nstopped to pick up something on the carpet.\n\n\"Ooo, Sol! Look! A Jupiter diamond!\"\n\nShe held up the largest and most expensive diamond I have ever seen.\n\nI was just going to claim credit for this little gift when another\nappeared, and another, and a long line marching over the carpet like an\nant trail. They came floating in under the door.\n\nNow love is for vacations, and between my own sweet Florence and a\ndiamond mine there is no comparison. I put on my dicyanin glasses and\nsaw the baby diver was back and at work teleporting. I said so, but\nthis time there were no hysterics from Florence.\n\n\"I was just thinking of him,\" she said, \"and wishing you had brought me\na Jupiter diamond instead.\"\n\n\"Well, honey, it looks as if you've got both.\"\n\nI watched her scrambling on the carpet, gathering handfuls of diamonds\nand not in the least interested in me.\n\nOn Antimony IX, the little divers switched from one space-time point\nto another simultaneously, and the baby diver had come back from the\nSolar Party Convention the same way. I thought of it and it came;\nFlorence had just thought of it and here it was. But now it seemed to\nbe flitting lightly from Earth to Jupiter and back with diamonds, so\nperhaps there was no interplanetary distance to a mind.\n\nThis had a future. I could see myself with a winter and a summer planet\nof my own, even happily paying Earth, Solar and Galactic taxes.\n\n\"Well, honey, don't you worry,\" I said. \"You don't like divers, so I'll\ntake it back and give you something else. Just leave it to Sol.\"\n\n\"Take your foot off that diamond, Sol Jones! You gave me this dear\nlittle diver and he's mine!\"\n\n\n\nShe sat back on her heels and thought. The evidence of her thinking\nimmediately came trickling through the door--Venusian opals set in\na gold bracelet half a pound heavy, Martian sleeze furs, spider-web\nstockings, platinum belts. The room was beginning to look like a video\nfashion center, a Galactic merchandise mart. And after Florence put on\na coat and opened the door, her ideas began to get bigger.\n\n\"This is fun!\" she cried, teleporting like mad. \"Why, I can have\nanything in the Galaxy just by thinking about it!\"\n\n\"Now, honey, think of the benefits to humanity! This is too big to be\nused for personal gain. This should be dedicated--\"\n\n\"This is dedicated to me, Sol Jones, so just you keep your fingers off\nit. Why, the cute little thing--look, he's been out to Saturn for me!\"\n\nI made a decision. Think wide and grand, Sol Jones, I said. Sacrifice\nyourself for the greater good.\n\n\"Florence, honey, you know I love you. Will you marry me?\"\n\nThat stopped her. \"You mean it, Sol?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"It's not just because of this diver?\"\n\n\"Why, honey, how could you think such a thing? If I'd never brought it\nin for you, I'd still want to marry you.\"\n\n\"You never said so before,\" she said. \"But okay. If you do it now.\nRight now, Sol Jones.\"\n\nSo the merchandise stopped coming in while we plugged into the video\nand participated in a moving and legal ceremony. The marriage service\nwas expensive, but after all we could teleport in a few thousand credit\nblanks from the Solar Treasury. Immediately after we had switched off,\nwe did so.\n\n\"Are you sure you married me for myself, Sol?\"\n\n\"I swear it, honey. No other thought entered my head. Just you.\"\n\nI made a few notes while Florence planned the house we would have,\nfurnished with rare materials from anywhere. I thought one of the\nmedium asteroids would do for a base for Sol Jones Intragalactic\nTransport. I could see it all, vast warehouses and immediate delivery\nof anything from anywhere. I wondered if there was a limit to the\ndiver's capacity, so Florence desired an encyclopedia and in it came,\nfloating through the doorway.\n\n\"It says,\" she read, \"not much is known about Antimony IX divers\nbecause none have ever been known to leave their planet.\"\n\n\"They probably need the stimulus of an educated mind,\" I said. \"Anyway,\nthis one can get diamonds from Jupiter and so on, and that's what\nmatters.\"\n\n\n\nI kissed the wife of the President of Sol Jones Intragalactic and\nwas interrupted by discreet tapping on the door. The manager of the\nAsteroid-Central beamed at us.\n\n\"Excuse,\" he said. \"But we understand you have just been married, Mr.\nand Mrs. Jones.\"\n\n\"Irrevocably,\" I said.\n\n\"Felicitations. The Asteroid-Central will be sending up complimentary\neuphorics. There is just a small point, Mr. Jones. We notice you have a\nlarge selection of valuable gifts for the bride.\"\n\nHe looked round the room and smiled at the piles of stuff Florence had\nthought of.\n\n\"Of course,\" he went on, \"we trust your stay will be pleasant and\nperhaps you will let us know if you will be wanting anything else.\"\n\n\"I expect we will, but we'll let you know,\" I said.\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Jones. It is merely that we noticed you had emptied\nevery showcase on the ground floor and, a few moments ago, teleported\nthe credit contents of the bar up here. Not of importance, really; it\nis all charged on your bill.\"\n\n\"You saw it and didn't stop it?\" I yelled.\n\n\"Oh, no, Mr. Jones. We always make an exception for Antimony IX divers.\nLimited creatures, really, but good for our business. We get about one\na month--smuggled in, you know. But the upkeep proves too expensive.\nSome women do shop without more than a passing thought, don't they?\"\n\nI saw what he meant, but Mrs. Sol Jones took it very philosophically.\n\n\"Never mind, Sol--you have me.\"\n\n\"Or vice versa, honey,\" I said.",
