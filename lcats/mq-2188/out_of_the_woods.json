    "body": "When you learn that this story begins with the heroine setting off\nthrough the woods to visit her grandmother, who was ill, you may guess\nthat it is the familiar tale of _Little Red Riding Hood_. I must admit\nthat that is what it is, and I warn you that you may count upon a very\nartless little heroine and a wolf of insinuating manners and glib\ntongue; but _this_ grandmother will not be eaten up.\n\nNor did Ethel carry a basket containing a little pat of butter and a\ncake. She had, instead, a large and luxurious box of candied fruit\nunder her arm; and instead of singing through the woods, she wore a\nsulky and miserable expression. Unfortunately red hoods are not in\nvogue, for such a thing would have been notably becoming to her little\ngypsy face. However, she was young enough and lovely enough to look\nwell in anything, even a sulky expression.\n\nShe was not without some excuse for her discontented air. Ethel was\none of those unfortunate little bones of contention so often to be\nfound in divided families, and she had been so much disputed over and\nargued about, and so rarely consulted or even questioned, that she had\ngrown to think of herself as a helpless pawn in an incomprehensible\ngame, where she could never win anything.\n\nThe disputes had begun long before she was born. Her father\u2019s family\nhad that pride of newly acquired wealth beside which pride of ancestry\nshrinks to nothing. Indeed, to spring from splendid ancestors may\noften make one feel a little humble, but to feel that one is vastly\nmore important than any of one\u2019s forbears makes for arrogance.\n\nThe Taylors had objected very much to the marriage of their only son.\nEven when the marriage was made, and there was no earthly use in\nobjecting, they kept on, in a very unpleasant way. All the misfortunes\nwhich the young man brought upon his wife and child by his\nrecklessness and folly only increased their anger against the victims;\nand when he died, they all came forward with helpful suggestions as to\nwhat he should have done when he was alive.\n\nEthel had been a small girl of nine then, and not yet looked upon as\nguilty; but when she refused to leave her mother and take advantage of\nthe offers made by several of the Taylors, she lost their sympathy.\nHer mother, with criminal selfishness, hadn\u2019t made the least attempt\nto persuade her child to leave her. On the contrary, she had gone back\nto her own people, and had lived with them in quiet contentment.\n\nIt was to these people of hers that the Taylors so strongly objected.\nShe herself was a quiet and inoffensive creature who gave little\ntrouble, but her parents were Italians, and poor, and not ashamed of\neither of the two things.\n\nDr. Mazetti had been professor of romance languages in a small Western\ncollege, but he had become so absorbed in the enormous commentary upon\nDante which he was writing that he found his teaching very much in the\nway; so he gave up his chair. Mrs. Taylor, the paternal grandmother,\nhad spoken about this.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she had said, not very pleasantly, \u201cit\u2019s a good thing to\nhave faith in your husband\u2019s work; but suppose it\u2019s _not_ a financial\nsuccess?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect it to be,\u201d replied Mrs. Mazetti, in her excellent\nEnglish. \u201cSuch work as that is not undertaken for money.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean to say that you\u2019ll permit your husband to give up his\u2014\u201d\nbegan Mrs. Taylor, but the other interrupted her.\n\n\u201cA _man_ does not ask the permission of others to do what he thinks\nbest,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI should be ashamed of myself if I were even\nto suggest that he should sacrifice his life\u2019s work on my account.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about yourself? Aren\u2019t you sacrificing\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI sacrifice nothing,\u201d said Mrs. Mazetti. \u201cI am very, very happy and\nproud.\u201d\n\nAnd so she was, and so was her only child until she married young\nTaylor; and so she was again when she came home with the little Ethel,\nto live with those simple, gentle people once more. Not for long,\nhowever, for she died some two years later.\n\nThen the arguments and disputes began again, and this time the Taylors\nwon. Children of eleven are pitifully easy to bribe, and while Ethel\nwas still dazed and stricken after the loss of her mother, all these\nrelations competed for her favor. She was petted and pampered as she\nhad never been before in her life.\n\nIt is regrettable to admit that she liked all this, liked the toys and\nthe pretty clothes and the indulgence better than the benign and quiet\nr\u00e9gime of her grandfather Mazetti, who believed that children should\nbe literally \u201cbrought up\u201d to the level of the wiser and more\nexperienced adults about them, instead of bringing a whole household\ndown to childish standards. He was always very patient and gentle, but\nhe was too fond of talking about Dante, and of relating anecdotes\nabout an Italian poet who insisted upon being tied into his chair, so\nthat he couldn\u2019t run away from his studies.\n\nMoreover, old Dr. Mazetti had no money to spend upon toys and clothes.\nThe Taylors took no interest in Dante or any other poet, but they took\nEthel to the circus; so she said she wanted to live with Aunt Amy, her\nfather\u2019s sister.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t aware, at the time, how terribly she had hurt the Mazettis.\nThey said very little. Indeed, they discussed it in private, and\ndecided that it was their duty to say very little. Aunt Amy could give\nEthel material benefits which they could not give; and if the child\npreferred that sort of thing, it was, after all, neither unnatural nor\nunexpected.\n\n\u201cEach must find his own,\u201d said Dr. Mazetti. \u201cWhat is joy for one is a\nburden for another.\u201d\n\nSo they let her go, and they did it beautifully, without saddening her\nlittle heart with reproaches or tears. She came back to visit them\nonce a month or so, but somehow, in her new existence, this quiet old\ncouple had begun to seem very foreign, very unreal.\n\nShe was abroad with her aunt when Dr. Mazetti died. Though she grieved\nfor him honestly, she was too young and too busy to nourish any sorrow\nlong.\n\n\n                                  II\n\nWhen Ethel Taylor came home, at nineteen, her grandmother seemed like\na little ghost from the past, utterly unconnected with her present\nlife. She still went to visit the old lady, and sat in the familiar\nroom in her little cottage, where the bronze bust of Dante appeared to\nimpose a dignified calm; but these visits were nothing but interludes\nto real life, and real life, just now, was a miserable thing.\n\nThe trouble was that Aunt Amy kept on being Aunt Amy, while the\nchildish Ethel and the nineteen-year-old one were entirely different\npersons. Aunt Amy wanted her to come out, and to be a nice, happy\nd\u00e9butante like other girls; but something in Ethel\u2019s blood rebelled\nagainst that. She called it a \u201cmodern spirit,\u201d and never realized that\ninstead of being modern, it was the old Mazetti strain, come down to\nher from people who for generations had not lived by bread alone.\n\nShe told her aunt that she wanted to be a singer.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a charming accomplishment,\u201d said Aunt Amy affably.\n\n\u201cI mean I want really to study\u2014for years and years!\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly, dear, if you can find the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cTime!\u201d said Ethel. \u201cWhat else do I ever do but waste time?\u201d\n\n\u201cNaturally you can\u2019t neglect your social duties\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDuties!\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t repeat my words in that odd way,\u201d said Aunt Amy, a\nlittle hurt. \u201cIf you want to study singing, there\u2019s no reason why you\nshouldn\u2019t, so long as you\u2019re not excessive about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I want to be excessive! I want to give all my time to it! I want\nto be a professional singer!\u201d\n\nAunt Amy laughed, not in order to be irritating, but because she\nreally thought it was funny. Not being a woman of much penetration,\nshe told some of her friends about that absurd little Ethel\u2019s\nfantastic idea.\n\nAs a result, the girl was teased about it. Ethel couldn\u2019t endure being\nteased. She had that queer lack of self-confidence, combined with\ntremendous resolution and a little vanity, that belong to young\nartists, and she felt that she was absurd, although she really knew\nthat she wasn\u2019t. She was ashamed to practice now, and at the same time\nshe exulted in her clear, strong, flexible voice. When she was asked\nto sing, she refused; yet sometimes, when she knew there were people\nin the drawing-room, she would go up the stairs or through the hall,\nsinging her loudest and sweetest, half terrified, half delighted, at\nthe glorious flood of melody that rose from her heart.\n\nShe didn\u2019t want anything else. She couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t be bothered\nwith \u201csocial duties.\u201d She wanted to work hard, all day and every day,\nuntil she was mistress of this great gift of hers, until she could\nsing in reality as she did in imagination. She had fits of black\ndepression, when the sounds that came from her throat seemed a mockery\nof what she intended. At other moments she was in wild spirits,\nbecause she was sure she had made a little progress.\n\nHer changing humors were so marked that Aunt Amy was gravely\nperturbed. She felt that Ethel was becoming \u201ceccentric,\u201d which was the\nworst thing any one could be, and she attributed it all to this\nannoying obsession with singing. In all good faith, she did what she\nthought best for the girl\u2014she stopped her lessons.\n\nEthel wept and stormed and entreated and argued until she was almost\nill, but without moving Aunt Amy.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d that lady said firmly. \u201cIf you\u2019ll put all that nonsense out of\nyour head, and lead a normal, sensible life like other girls, I\u2019ll let\nyou take up singing again in a year.\u201d\n\nShe hoped and believed that within a year\u2019s time such a pretty and\ndelightful girl would surely find something better to think about.\n\nEthel was helpless. She was exquisitely dressed, and she lived in\ngreat comfort and luxury, but she hadn\u2019t a penny of her own to pay for\nlessons.\n\nArtists, however\u2014even young and undeveloped ones\u2014are very hard to deal\nwith, because they will not give up and be sensible. Instead of\nresigning herself to doing without what she wanted, Ethel did nothing\nbut think how she could get at least a part of it. Being nineteen, and\nrash, and terribly in earnest, she was dallying with a singularly\nunsuitable idea.\n\n\n                                 III\n\n\u201cHello, Lad!\u201d she said, not at all surprised, and apparently not very\nmuch pleased, at the sudden appearance of a young man on that quiet\npath through the woods.\n\n\u201cHello, Ethel!\u201d he returned, and fell into step beside her.\n\nShe didn\u2019t trouble to glance at her companion. She knew exactly how he\nlooked, anyhow. He was slender and supple and dark, and handsome in\nhis way\u2014which was not her way.\n\nThere were times when the sleekness of his hair and the brightness of\nhis smile and the extreme fastidiousness of his clothes exasperated\nher. There were other times when his talk about music made her see in\nhim the one sympathetic, understanding person on earth. He had learned\nto read the signs, and to tell which sort of time it was; and he\nfancied that this was a favorable moment.\n\n\u201cHave you been thinking\u2014\u201d he began softly.\n\n\u201cNaturally,\u201d said she. \u201cI suppose every one does, once in a while.\u201d\n\nYoung Ladislaw Metz was not easily discouraged. He, too, was an\nartist.\n\n\u201cDo you mind my walking with you, Ethel?\u201d he asked patiently. \u201cI came\nall the way out from the city on the chance of meeting you here,\nbecause I had something special to tell you.\u201d\n\nShe thought she knew what he meant, and frowned; but when he began to\nspeak, the frown vanished, and she sat down on the grass to listen.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nOld Mrs. Mazetti was waiting and waiting in her chair by the window.\nAll the bright spring afternoon had passed. The sky was blue no more,\nbut faint and mournful as the sun went down. Outside, the light\nlingered, but in the room it was dark \u2014very dark, very quiet. Ethel\nhad written to say that she would come early, and for hours the old\nlady had been watching the road along which her granddaughter must\ncome. It always made her uneasy to think of a girl as young and pretty\nas Ethel traveling alone.\n\nThis was one of the very few ideas that Aunt Amy shared with Mrs.\nMazetti. Aunt Amy wanted Ethel to go properly in a motor car, but her\nniece was so obstinately set on going by train that she had yielded.\nAfter all, it was such a trifling matter\u2014an hour\u2019s journey to a\nsuburb, to visit a grandmother. The good lady never so much as\nimagined the existence of Ladislaw Metz, or any one like him.\n\nBut old Mrs. Mazetti did. Not that she knew anything of this\nparticular young man, but she had had opportunity, in her long life,\nto observe that in such cases there generally was a young man. When\nEthel began taking more and more time between the station and the\nhouse, the old lady grew more and more sure, and more distressed.\n\nShe said nothing, however, because her grandchild showed no\ndisposition to confide in her, and she knew that more harm than good\nwould result from asking questions. She couldn\u2019t get near to Ethel.\nShe had tried time after time, with all her quiet subtlety, to bring\nabout a greater intimacy, to show how steadfast and profound was her\nsympathy; but Ethel never saw.\n\nIn fact, Ethel didn\u2019t know that she needed sympathy. She thought that\nall she wanted was to be let alone. Without in the least meaning to be\nunkind, she ignored the invaluable love that would so greatly have\nhelped her.\n\nFor the third time the servant came in to light the lamp, and this\ntime Mrs. Mazetti permitted it. She had given up expecting Ethel for\nthat day.\n\n\u201cShe has forgotten,\u201d she thought.\n\nIn spite of her bitter disappointment, she could still smile a little\nover the girl\u2019s careless youth. The sun had vanished now, and a\nstrange yellow twilight lay over the earth like a sulphurous mist. It\nwas a melancholy hour. The brightness of the little room made the\noutside world more forlorn and dim by contrast.\n\nMrs. Mazetti was about to turn away from the window with a sigh, when\nshe caught sight of Ethel hurrying along the road\u2014with a young man.\nThe girl\u2019s companion left her when they were still some distance from\nthe house. If the old lady hadn\u2019t had remarkably sharp eyes, she would\nnever have seen him.\n\nEthel came in alone.\n\n\u201cGrandmother!\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m awfully ashamed of myself for being so\nlate!\u201d\n\nShe really was ashamed and sorry, but it was not her nature to invent\nexcuses, and she had no intention of explaining. Mrs. Mazetti saw all\nthis perfectly, and did not fail to note something defiant in her\ngrandchild\u2019s expression. Nevertheless, she meant to come to the point\nthis time.\n\n\u201cYou were with a friend?\u201d she asked mildly.\n\n\u201cYes, grandmother.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour Aunt Amy knows this friend?\u201d\n\nEthel tried to imitate that tranquil, affectionate tone.\n\n\u201cNo, grandmother, she doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s just a boy I met at the studio\nwhere I used to take singing lessons.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you think she would not care for him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know she wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Ethel answered candidly. \u201cI don\u2019t care for him\nso very much myself; but we\u2019re interested in the same things, and\nnobody else is.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn music?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. He\u2019s\u2014\u201d Ethel began, but she stopped.\n\nWhat was the use of going on, and being told again how absurd she was?\nMrs. Mazetti was silent, too, but not because she felt discouraged.\nShe was thinking, trying to understand.\n\n\u201cYou are still always thinking of the singing?\u201d she asked softly.\n\nEthel\u2019s face flushed, and her young mouth set in a harsh line.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to listen to any more lectures,\u201d she thought. \u201cNo one\nunderstands. No one ever will!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis young man is a musician?\u201d her grandmother asked.\n\n\u201cYes, in a way,\u201d said Ethel. \u201cIsn\u2019t the country pretty at this time of\nthe year, grandmother?\u201d\n\nThe old lady looked out of the window at the rapidly darkening sky,\nagainst which the trees stood out as black as ink. It seemed to her\nnot at all pretty now, but vast and terrible.\n\n\u201cMy little Ethel!\u201d she thought. \u201cMy little bird, who longs to sing!\nWhat is this going on now, poor foolish little one? What am I to do?\u201d\n\nShe missed her husband acutely. She missed him always, but more than\never at this instant. Ethel would have listened to him, for every one\ndid. Quiet and tranquil as he was, there had been an air of authority\nabout him that she had never seen disregarded.\n\nEthel was very still. The lamp threw a clear light on her warm, vivid\nyoung face, downcast and plainly unhappy.\n\n\u201cIf I spoke to your Aunt Amy about those lessons?\u201d suggested the old\nlady.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t do the least bit of good, grandmother. I\u2019ve said\neverything there is to be said; and\u2014anyhow, I don\u2019t care now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not, Ethel? Why not now?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know!\u201d Ethel replied airily. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about it,\ngrandmother. I\u2019ve brought some candied fruit. You like that, don\u2019t\nyou?\u201d\n\nThe old lady untied the flamboyant package with fingers that were not\nvery steady. While she was doing so, the clock struck six.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to go,\u201d said Ethel quickly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I came so late and\nhad such a tiny visit, grandmother, but\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, my little Ethel. Gianetta will order a taxi.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no, thanks!\u201d said Ethel. \u201cI like the walk.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot now, in the dark, my dear.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind the dark. It\u2019s really not at all late. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d said the old lady with unexpected firmness. \u201cThere must be a\ntaxi, and Gianetta will go with you to the train.\u201d\n\nEthel answered politely, but with equal firmness, that she didn\u2019t want\nthat.\n\n\u201cCome here, my little Ethel!\u201d said her grandmother. When the girl\nstood before her, she took both of her hands. \u201cThis friend \u2014 this\nyoung man \u2014 is waiting for you?\u201d\n\nEthel flushed, but she answered with the fine honesty that had been\nhers all her life.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d she said, in just the sturdy, defiant tone she used to confess\na piece of childish mischief years and years ago.\n\n\u201cYou see me here,\u201d said Mrs. Mazetti, \u201cunable even to rise from my\nchair. I could do nothing to stop you, if I wished. I do not wish,\nbecause I trust you; only I ask you to tell me a little.\u201d\n\nEthel was more moved than she wished to be. She bent to kiss the soft\nwhite hair.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not, please!\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf you will remember, my little Ethel, that your mother always came\nto me, always told me what troubled her! I am very old. I have learned\nvery much, seen very much. I could help you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t, grandmother. You wouldn\u2019t like my\u2014plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen perhaps I could make a better one.\u201d\n\nMrs. Mazetti felt the girl\u2019s warm hands tremble, and saw her lip\nquiver. She waited, terribly anxious.\n\n\u201cYou see,\u201d said Ethel, \u201call I care about is being able to sing. Nobody\nbelieves that. No one understands except Ladislaw!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is the young man?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014Ladislaw Metz,\u201d said Ethel, a little impatient at this interest\nin the least important part of her story. \u201cHe knows what it means to\nme.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is he? He sings?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a barytone. He\u2019s going to be a wonderful singer some day.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut now? What is he now?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you see, he\u2019s poor, and he can\u2019t afford to go on studying just\nnow. So\u2014I don\u2019t like to tell you, because you\u2019ll think he\u2019s not really\na musician\u2014he\u2019s on the stage.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d said the old lady, with perfect composure. \u201cThe theater? An\noperetta?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, no\u2014it\u2019s vaudeville. He\u2019s been singing awful, cheap, popular\nsongs, just to keep himself alive. Now he wants a partner for a better\nsort of turn\u2014an act, you know. We should sing\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to give me a chance,\u201d said Ethel quietly. The old lady was\nsilent for a moment.\n\n\u201cI should like to hear about it,\u201d she told the girl at last, in a\nvoice that touched Ethel profoundly\u2014a voice so determined to sound\ncheerful and sympathetic.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you, grandmother,\u201d she said gently; \u201cbecause you\u2019d think\nit was your duty to tell Aunt Amy, and she\u2019d try to stop me. I don\u2019t\nintend to be stopped. I may never have another chance. I don\u2019t care\nwhat I have to sacrifice. I\u2019d gladly give up anything on earth for my\nsinging. You can\u2019t think what it\u2019s like to have that in you\u2014such a\nterrible longing\u2014to know that you _can_ do it, and to be stopped and\nturned aside and laughed at!\u201d She bent and kissed the old lady again.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to go now, grandmother dear!\u201d she said, with a sob.\n\n\u201cNo! Little Ethel! No!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to, grandmother. I promised.\u201d\n\n\u201cEthel! You promised what?\u201d\n\nThe girl was frankly crying now.\n\n\u201cGood-by, darling!\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been my dearest, kindest\nfriend. If I hadn\u2019t been a little beast, I\u2019d never have left you; but\nI am a little beast. I must go my own way. I\u2019ve got to go. Good-by,\ndear!\u201d\n\nHer hand was on the door knob.\n\n\u201cNo, Ethel, no!\u201d cried the old lady.\n\nWith one backward glance, tearful, soft, but utterly resolute, the\ngirl was gone.\n\n\u201cGianetta!\u201d called Mrs. Mazetti.\n\nGianetta came in from the kitchen with the querulous expression\nnatural to her. She had been the old lady\u2019s servant for nearly twenty\nyears. She adored her, and had never found her anything but just,\nkind, and generous. Nevertheless, Gianetta had a great many\ngrievances, and did not keep them to herself.\n\n\u201cTelephone,\u201d said her mistress, \u201cand order me a taxi.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou? You a taxi?\u201d cried Gianetta. \u201cBut that is mad!\u201d\n\n\u201cQuick, Gianetta!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you are very ill! With this rheumatism, you can\u2019t walk! How do\nyou think then that you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cQuick, Gianetta!\u201d\n\n\u201cPatience! Patience!\u201d said Gianetta, in her most annoying tone. \u201cI\norder this taxi, but you cannot get into it. It is only a waste of\nmoney. No matter\u2014you are the mistress. I telephone!\u201d\n\n\u201cNow!\u201d said the old lady to herself, \u201cI _must get up_. Leo always said\nthat what one ought to do, one would find strength for. I must do\nthis. For one minute more I shall sit quietly here, and then I shall\nrise and get myself ready.\u201d\n\nShe clasped her hands in her lap and laid her head against the back of\nthe chair, looking out at the sky, now quite dark. Then, with a long\nsigh, she grasped the arms and slowly raised herself to her feet.\n\nGianetta, coming in again, gave a loud shriek.\n\n\u201cSilence, you foolish one,\u201d said the old lady. \u201cGet me my cloak and\nhat.\u201d\n\n\n                                  IV\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand you,\u201d said Ladislaw, in a deeply injured voice.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll trust your whole life to me, and yet\u2014\u201d\n\nThe little wood was dark and unfamiliar, and he found it very\ndisagreeable to hurry along at the pace she set.\n\n\u201cAnd yet you behave\u2014\u201d he went on.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trusting my whole life to you,\u201d replied Ethel vehemently.\n\u201cI\u2019d be sorry to think there was nothing better than that to trust\nin!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not quite the way to talk to the man you\u2019re going to marry, is\nit?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried my best to do what you wanted. I\ndon\u2019t see why you shouldn\u2019t trust me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see, either, Lad,\u201d Ethel answered, with her discounting\nfrankness. \u201cOnly somehow you seem so\u2014so dreadfully strange to me. I\nnever understand you. I know you must be fond of me, or you wouldn\u2019t\nhave asked me to marry you; and I know it\u2019s a sensible, practical idea\nif we\u2019re going on tour. But I can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d She choked down a sob.\n\u201cI can\u2019t feel\u2014friendly\u2014with you!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to. I want you to love me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they ought to go together!\u201d she cried. \u201cI\u2019m awfully grateful to\nyou, and I love to hear you sing, but I\u2019m afraid! Oh, it\u2019s not fair to\nyou, because I know I\u2019ll never feel like that!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will some day,\u201d he answered, with a patience that frightened her\nstill more.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to be honest with you, Lad. I\u2019m sure I shall never feel so.\nIt\u2019s only because I want this chance so much\u2014so much that I\u2019d do\nalmost anything to get it. I know that if I can once sing in public, I\nshall be all right, and\u2014\u201d\n\nHe laughed softly.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t go so fast,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing does. You will have what\nevery one else has\u2014two failures for each triumph, two pains for every\njoy. You will have hard work, discouragement, anxiety, and a good many\nother troubles you\u2019ve never thought of. That\u2019s why I ask you to marry\nme, because you need some one to protect you. If you don\u2019t love me,\nvery well! I\u2019ll love you twice as much, to make up for it.\u201d\n\nHis hand fell lightly on her shoulder. She sprang aside hastily.\n\nThat did not offend him. He never seemed to be offended or impatient.\nHe was always reasonable, kind, sympathetic; and yet, instead of being\npleased or touched by this, Ethel found it disquieting and mysterious.\n\nHis polite endurance of her changing humors was more like that of\nindifference than that of love. Of course, he did love her. He must,\nand she was a very fortunate girl to have found, at the very beginning\nof her career, a man who loved her and who could and would help her so\ngreatly.\n\nThis first venture was in itself a thing very displeasing to her. It\nwas a vaudeville act of his own devising, in which, with several\nchanges of costume, they would sing snatches from the most popular\noperas, all woven together to make a silly story. She tried to look\nbeyond that, to the great triumphs of the future. She tried to feel\nthat these triumphs would be ample compensation for the monstrous\nsacrifice she was making of her life.\n\nOnce in a while, in a brief flash, she half realized what she was\ndoing. The memory of her mother came back to her\u2014that gentle and quiet\nwoman who had held so steadfastly to her own ideals.\n\nNo matter how ardent her desire for perfection in her beloved art, no\nmatter how splendid her ambition, Ethel could not be rid of a secret\nand bitter sense of guilt. It was wrong\u2014she knew it\u2014it was wrong and\nunworthy to marry Ladislaw.\n\n\u201cBut why?\u201d she demanded of herself. \u201cI don\u2019t care anything about love,\nand men, and things like that. Ladislaw knows it, and if he doesn\u2019t\ncare, why should I? Anyhow, it\u2019s too late now. I\u2019ve promised, and I\u2019m\ngoing to keep my word. Mother would want me to do that. Oh, but if\nmother had been here, she would have understood! She would never have\nlet me get into such a dreadful, miserable, heartbreaking situation!\nIf she could come now, just for one little minute, just to say one\nword\u2014\u201d\n\nBut there was no one there except Ladislaw. The lights of the railway\nstation gleamed before them, and he drew close to her.\n\n\u201cGive me one kiss, Ethel!\u201d he said, very low.\n\nShe hated his voice, she hated to have him so near her, she hated\nherself. The little wood seemed like a black and sinister forest.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d she said brusquely, as she had often spoken to him before.\n\nThis time he was not patient and humble. He caught her arm, and tried\nto draw her to him.\n\n\u201cYou shan\u2019t treat me like a dog!\u201d he muttered.\n\nIn growing alarm, she stared at him in the dark, and she fancied she\nsaw his white teeth revealed by a wolfish grin. With a violent wrench,\nshe freed herself. With the swiftness of terror, she ran out of that\nhaunted wood into the safe, bright road before the station.\n\nAs she stood there, flushed and panting, trying to consider the\nsituation, he came leisurely up to her.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go back now\u2014not after that telegram you sent your aunt,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere for you to go, except with me. You haven\u2019t even\nyour ticket or your purse. You gave them to me to keep \u2014and I mean to\nkeep them!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care\u2014I\u2019ll walk,\u201d she retorted, in a trembling voice.\n\n\u201cWalk where?\u201d he inquired. \u201cYou told your aunt you were going away to\nget married. You\u2019ll have hard work explaining that you changed your\nmind; and you\u2019ll have hard work getting home at all without a penny.\nCome! Here\u2019s the train. Don\u2019t be a little fool!\u201d\n\nThe long, mournful hoot of the approaching engine came to her ears.\n\n\u201cOh, give me my purse!\u201d she cried in terror and despair. \u201cOh, please!\nOh, please, Ladislaw!\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you won\u2019t come with me, I\u2019ll leave you here\nalone. You\u2019ll be sorry, Ethel. You\u2019ll lose your chance to be a singer,\nand you\u2019ll lose more than that. Your aunt won\u2019t take this very well.\u201d\n\nShe looked around in anguish. The ticket office was closed for the\nnight, and there were only strangers on the platform. All about that\nlittle lighted oasis were the woods and fields and tiny distant\nhouses, filled with more strangers.\n\n\n                                  V\n\n\u201cEthel!\u201d cried a voice.\n\nIt was the voice of the one person who would understand and help and\nsolace her\u2014a voice she could never hear again in this world, strong,\ntender, and clear.\n\n\u201cOh, mother!\u201d she cried.\n\n\u201cEthel!\u201d\n\nIt came again, and not the voice of a spirit, but real, and close at\nhand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s some one in that taxi,\u201d whispered Ladislaw. \u201cBetter not answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s grandmother!\u201d said Ethel, astounded.\n\nShe flew to the old lady like a stone from a catapult.\n\n\u201cGrandmother, what _are_ you doing here?\u201d she demanded, wild with\ndelight and relief.\n\n\u201cNothing!\u201d replied the old lady serenely. \u201cPresent your friend to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d began Ethel.\n\nLadislaw was already there, hat in hand.\n\n\u201cMr. Metz, grandmother,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAh! Mr. Metz!\u201d the old lady repeated, looking thoughtfully at him.\nHer calm old eyes seemed terrible to him. \u201cAre you leaving?\u201d she\nasked.\n\nHe hesitated for a moment. Then he remembered that Ethel had never\nseemed to regard her grandmother as especially important. She was old,\nand poor, and obscure; what harm could she do?\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cEthel and I are going to be married. She\u2019s already\nsent a telegram to her aunt in the city, to tell her.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a rash young man,\u201d said the old lady, in a tone almost\nfriendly.\n\n\u201cRash?\u201d he repeated, with a faint frown.\n\n\u201cVery!\u201d said she. \u201cIt is a surprise to me, because I see that you are\nnot American. Americans marry that way\u2014for love; but with the people\nof Europe, it is often different. They think of how they shall live.\nThey wish a dot\u2014a dowry\u2014something more than love. It is very\nbeautiful, this; because the poor little Ethel will never have\nanything.\u201d\n\nMetz was too much taken aback to be discreet.\n\n\u201cBut she will!\u201d he said. \u201cHer aunt will\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHer aunt has only the income of an estate. She leaves nothing to\nEthel; and certainly she _gives_ nothing to Ethel when she is the wife\nof Mr. Metz.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I thought\u2014\u201d he began.\n\nSuddenly the frail little old creature blazed into magnificent wrath.\n\n\u201cBe off!\u201d she cried, raising her hand in a threatening gesture. \u201cAway\nwith you, miserable, beggarly fortune hunter! Wolf! _Bestia!_ Be off!\u201d\n\nHe started back. She leaned out of the window, her voice wonderfully\nstrong and vigorous for her years. As he retreated, even above the\nroar of the incoming train, he heard her only too plainly, and was\naware that other people heard her, too.\n\n\u201cBeggarly fortune hunter! Wolf! _Bestia!_ Away with you!\u201d\n\nHe was glad to climb on board.\n\nThe taxi went hastening back along the dark, still roads, and the old\nlady held the sobbing Ethel tight in her arms.\n\n\u201cBut what is there to cry about?\u201d she asked, in tears herself.\n\u201cFoolish little one! You shall stay with me, my little bird, until you\nare ready to fly away. There was something put by for you to have\u2014\nlater. You shall have it now, for the singing lessons. Why do you cry,\nthen? You shall sing, I tell you!\u201d\n\nEthel was silent for a time.\n\n\u201cGrandmother!\u201d she said. \u201cThe first time you called me\u2014it sounded\u2014I\nthought it was\u2014mother!\u201d\n\nThe old lady\u2019s arm tightened about her.\n\n\u201cIt is the same voice,\u201d she said.",
