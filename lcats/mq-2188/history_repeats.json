    "body": "BY GEORGE O. SMITH\n\n_There are--and very probably\nwill always be--some Terrestrials\nwho can't, and for\nthat matter don't want, to call\ntheir souls their own...._\n\n\nXanabar lays across the Spiral Arm, a sprawling sphere of influence\nvast, mighty, solid at the core. Only the far-flung boundary shows the\nslight ebb and flow of contingent cultures that may win a system or two\ntoday and lose them back tomorrow or a hundred years from now. Xanabar\nis the trading post of the galaxy, for only Xanabar is strong enough to\nstand over the trading table when belligerents meet and offer to take\nthem both at once if they do not sheathe their swords. For this service\nXanabar assesses her percentage, therefore Xanabar is rich. Her riches\nbuy her mercenaries to enforce her doctrines. Therefore Xanabar is\nrotten at the under-core, for mercenaries have no god but gold.\n\n\n\nThe clatter of a hundred tongues mingled with the clink of glasses and\nfloated through strata of smoke from the burning weeds of a hundred\nplanets. From one of the tables, voices rise in mild disagreement. There\nis a jeering laugh from one side and a roar of anger from the other. Two\nmen rise and face one another ready to follow their insults with\nviolence. Before the eruption can start, a mercenary steps forward on\nlithe feet and lightly catches the back-swung arm, a quick hand removes\nthe poised glass before it can be thrown into the adversary's face.\n\n\"Sit!\" says the mercenary in a cold voice, and they sit still glaring at\none another.\n\n\"Now,\" says the mercenary, \"settle your differences by talk. Or depart\nin opposite directions. This is Xanabar!\"\n\n\"He lies! He brags!\"\n\n\"I do not lie. They _are_ barbarians. I do not brag. I _can_ bring you\none.\"\n\n\"You--\"\n\n\"A wager,\" said the mercenary. \"A wager. Xanabar can take no tax in\nblood.\" He faces one. \"You claim you can do that which he says you can\nnot.\" Then not waiting for a reply he faces the other, \"And if he does,\nhow much are you willing to pay?\"\n\n\"How much is his life worth?\"\n\n\"How much are you willing to pay?\" demands the mercenary coldly.\n\n\"Five hundredweight in crystal-cut.\"\n\n\"An honorable sum. Do you agree?\"\n\n\"Not enough--\"\n\n\"For a task as easy as you claim it to be,\" said the mercenary, \"Five\nhundredweight of crystal-cut seems honorable.\"\n\n\"But it means--\"\n\n\"We in Xanabar are not interested in the details. Only in the tax. An\nhonest wager-contract, outlanders. Otherwise I rule that your eruption\nhere disturbed the peace.\"\n\nThe two outlanders look at one another; schoolboys caught fighting in\nthe alley by a monitor who demands a bite of their apple in lieu of a\nvisit to the principal. As if loath to touch one another they reach\nforward hesitantly and handshake in a quick light grip.\n\n\"Good!\" glows the mercenary. He waves a hand and his fellows converge\nwith contract-platen and etching stylus. \"Now, gentlemen, please state\nthe terms for Xanabar.\"\n\n\n\nPeter Hawley strolled down a side street with a dog at his heel. It was\na dog of many breeds, but not a mixture of careless parentage. Peter\npaused at a cross-street and looked uncertainly to left and right. \"What\ndo you make, Buregarde?\"\n\n\"The noble dog says right,\" replied Buregarde.\n\n\"Right,\" said Peter turning up the street. \"And stop this 'Noble dog'\nroutine.\"\n\n\"Man is dog's best friend,\" said Buregarde. \"If you'd called me\nsomething sensible, I wouldn't have looked it up. There is a statue to\nme in the Okeefenokee back on Earth. I am the noble dog. Pogo says so.\"\n\n\"I--\"\n\n\"Easy Peter!\" said the dog in a near-whisper.\n\n\"All right. Do we play down the chatter?\"\n\nBuregarde sat, lifted his nose and sniffed. His natural voice gave a\nfaint whine of discontent. \"I'm supposed to have a nose,\" he complained.\n\"This is like trying to smell out a lone mouse in a zoological garden in\nmidsummer.\"\n\n\"Why the warning?\" asked Peter.\n\n\"All races smell the same when they are poised for violence,\" said the\ndog. \"Trouble is that man-smell isn't pointed the way it's going, only\nwhere it's coming from.\"\n\nPeter grunted. \"Catch any woman-smell?\"\n\n\"Just the usual whiff. Stale scent. She was here; she passed this way.\nBut which way?\"\n\n\"We can guess they made it away from the spaceport.\"\n\n\"Unless,\" said the dog taking another sniff of the air, \"they're taking\nher back to some other spacecraft.\" Buregarde looked up at Peter. \"Do\nyou catch anything?\"\n\n\"Just the usual mingled fright and danger, frantic despair.\"\n\n\"Directional?\"\n\nPeter shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"The source is too close.\"\n\n\"Let's stroll up this street to the end and come back on the other\nside,\" said the dog. \"Quietly.\"\n\nIn a saunter they went, alert and poised. A man and his dog from all\nappearances. But in Xanabar, the principal city of Xanabar the Empire\nthey were huntsman and companion.\n\nLike all cities of more than ten million souls, Xanabar had its\nglistening and lofty area and its slums--and what would have been a\nwaterfront region in a seafaring city. The conditions were the same as\nthey'd been everywhere for a few decades of thousands of years. Only the\ntechnology changes. Man's cave is stainless steel and synthetic plastic;\nthe cave's man is swinging a better axe, and his hide is protected from\nthe weather by stuff far more durable than his awn skin. But he's the\nsame man with the same hackles; they just rise for a few more thousand\nreasons than the hackles of his ancestors.\n\n\"Got it!\" said Buregarde coming to a brief point at a closed door.\n\n\"Let's go in!\"\n\n\n\nBuregarde's reply was half-snarl and half, \"Look out!\"\n\nPeter whirled to catch a glimpse of a man upon him with pencil-ray\ncoming to point. He faded down and toward the other, almost in a fall\nout of the path of the pencil-ray that flicked on and began a sweep\nupward and in. Peter caught his balance at the same time he clutched the\nwrist in his right hand. Then he went on down around and over, rising on\nhis knees to flip the other man heels high in an arc that ended with a\nfull-length, spine-thudding body smash on the pavement. Buregarde leaped\nin and slashed at the hand clutching the pencil-ray, snapped his head\nback and forth thrice and sent the weapon flying. Then with a savage\ngrowl he set a soft mouth against the other's throat and let the man\nfeel the pressure of his fangs.\n\n\"Easy,\" said Peter.\n\nBuregarde backed away a few inches. \"Easy nothing,\" he snapped. \"This\nman is the noble dog's worst enemy. He wanted your blood.\"\n\n\"Take it easy. I want his information.\"\n\nThe man looked up. \"Barbarian Terrestrial!\" he snarled.\n\nPeter sneered. \"And this is the capital city of the glorious\ncivilization called Xanabar? Marble palaces with nobles of the blood,\nand stinking alleys with human rats. Where is she?\"\n\nThe stranger spat.\n\n\"Buregarde, want some red meat?\"\n\n\"He'd make me upchuck. Only rodents eat their own kind.\"\n\n\"Just a bite?\"\n\n\"Do I have to swallow?\"\n\n\"No. Just slash--\"\n\n\"Wait, barbarian--\"\n\n\"Barbarian Terrestrial, am I? You were maybe going to invite me for tea\nand cakes with that pencil-ray?\"\n\n\"I--\"\n\n\"Talk!\" snapped Peter. \"Where is she?\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Buregarde--?\"\n\n\"Yes, boss. The throat or the other hand?\"\n\n\"All right--for the good it'll do you. She's in there. Go on in--and\nwe'll have two of you!\"\n\nBuregarde growled, \"Three of us. And we might be hard to handle.\"\n\nPeter stood up and hauled the stranger to his feet. His right hand\ndripped blood from the dog's teeth. Peter looked for, and found the\npencil-ray smashed against the stone front of the building. He cuffed\nthe stranger across the face, turned him around, and pointed him toward\nthe far corner.\n\n\"I count three,\" he said. \"If you're not out of sight by three--\"\n\n\"It'll be a pleasure, Peter,\" said Buregarde.\n\n\n\nThe stranger loped away on a crazy run. As he turned the corner he ran\nface on to one of the uniformed mercenaries of Xanabar. The mercenary\ncollared the stranger and took a quick inventory of the slashed right\nhand, the ripped clothing, and adding those to the frightened gallop he\ncame back with the stranger's left arm held in a backlock.\n\nHaughtily he demanded, \"What goes on in Xanabar?\"\n\nPeter eyed the mercenary sourly. \"Kidnaping and attempted murder.\"\n\n\"Who says such lawlessness runs rife in Xanabar?\"\n\n\"I say so. Peter Hawley of the Extraterrestrial Service. I say so.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, barbarian.\"\n\n\"I say so,\" said Buregarde.\n\n\"You're an animal.\"\n\n\"I am--and so are you.\"\n\n\"I'll not be insulted by an animal! I am--\"\n\n\"Take it easy, Buregarde.\"\n\n\"Take it easy nothing. This mercenary foot-soldier forgets one thing--or\nmaybe he doesn't know about it.\"\n\n\"Don't call His Excellency's Peacekeepers 'mercenaries'!\" snapped the\nmercenary.\n\n\"Peacekeeper,\" chuckled the dog. \"Well listen and become wise. Dog and\nman, man and dog, have been together for about a half-million years.\nOnce dog helped man in war and peace, and man gave dog food and shelter.\nDog helped man rise above the level of the savage, and man has helped\ndog rise to the level of intelligence. But dog has one advantage. None\nof us has been intelligent long enough to really believe that dog has a\nsoul, and those of us who do believe that also know that dog's soul is\ndevoted to man. Do you know about dog, Xanabian--Peacekeeper?\"\n\n\"No--\"\n\n\"Then don't force me to show you what kind of adversary intelligent dog\ncan be. Mere man is a pushover!\"\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\nBuregarde loped in a mad circle around the mercenary. His Excellency's\nPeacekeeper turned to stay facing the dog but found himself turning his\nback on Peter. He stepped back and to one side and reached for his\nheavy-duty pencil--the dog gave a low growl of warning and crouched for\na leap.\n\n\"He means it--Peacekeeper,\" said Peter Hawley quietly. \"Draw that pencil\nand he'll have your hand in ribbons before you can level it.\"\n\nThe mercenary drew in his breath.\n\n\"Whistle for help and he'll have your throat.\"\n\n\"I shall not permit this high handed--\"\n\n\"Then stop sounding off and listen to us!\" snapped Peter. \"I charge the\nEmpire of Xanabar with the crime of being indifferent to the welfare of\nthe stranger within her gate. I charge kidnaping and attempted murder,\nand I charge the latter against the specimen you hold in your hand.\"\n\n\"An outlander!\"\n\n\"Does he bring his own law to Xanabar? If he does, then so do I!\"\n\n\"I arrest you all for breaking the Peace of Xanabar.\"\n\n\"Me, too?\" asked Buregarde.\n\nThe mercenary ignored the dog's eager sally. \"You are armed,\nTerrestrial.\"\n\n\"So was he.\"\n\n\"So am I!\" snarled Buregarde showing a fine set of white fangs in the\nmost effective gesture.\n\n\"This must cease!\" thundered the mercenary. \"You cannot threaten His\nExcellency's Peacekeepers!\"\n\nBuregarde growled, \"Slip the mercenary a crystal-cut, boss. We've got a\ngirl to find!\"\n\n\"A girl? A Terrestrial girl?\" asked the mercenary with his eyes opening.\n\n\"The daughter of our envoy to Lonaphite. Miss Vanessa Lewis. Last\nreported in her stateroom aboard the Terrestrial Spacecraft _Polaris_\nduring landing pattern at Xanabar Citadel Spaceport.\"\n\nThe mercenary said, \"The work of outlanders--riffraff such as this!\"\n\n\"Well,\" snapped Peter Hawley, \"do His Excellency's Peacemakers condone\nsuch goings-on?\"\n\n\"We keep the Peace of Xanabar. Your charge is your word, Terrestrial.\"\n\n\"Terrestrial Barbarian, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I arrest you--\"\n\n\"Oh, stop it. For fiveweight of crystal-cut can you be bribed to haul\nthat specimen off to jail and let me go about making my own Peace with\nXanabar?\"\n\n\"You accuse me of accepting bribes?\"\n\n\"You re a mercenary, aren't you? Sevenweight of crystal-cut.\"\n\n\"Ten.\"\n\n\"Seven,\" said Peter.\n\n\"Ten,\" said the mercenary, \"and you have one more caper coming.\"\n\n\"Ten,\" agreed Peter Hawley, \"and you look the other way when I take the\nlid off.\"\n\n\n\n\"Still got it,\" said Buregarde, sniffing at the closed door but keeping\none eye on the disappearing mercenary and his prisoner.\n\n\"I've got it, too. Still fright and concern: fear of harm, concern over\nwhat happens next.\"\n\n\"Strong?\"\n\n\"Definitely,\" said Peter closing his eyes and holding his breath.\n\n\"Nothing measurable?\" asked the dog after a full minute.\n\n\"No. Too bad I was never introduced to her. I have no idea of her\nstrength of mind--wait!\" Another minute went by in personal silence;\nPeter Hawley's concentration far too deep to be disturbed by the sounds\nof the city's spaceport slum by night. The dog backed away from the door\nand took an alert position to guard Peter while the man was immersed in\nhis own mind. Finally Peter alerted and shook his head sadly. \"I thought\nfor a moment that she'd caught me. A fleeting thought of rescue or\nescape, concept of freedom, flight, safety. But wish-thinking. Not\ncommunication. Let's go in.\"\n\n\"Barge, or slink?\" asked the dog.\n\n\"Slink.\"\n\n\"Have it your way,\" said Buregarde.\n\nOutside, the place looked closed. The door was solid, a plastic in\nimitation of bronze through which neither light nor sound passed. The\nwindows were dark. But once the door was cracked, the wave of sound came\npouring out along the slit of light and filled the street with echo and\nre-echo.\n\n\"Slink, now,\" said the dog.\n\n\"So everybody makes mistakes.\"\n\nInside, a woman leaned over a low counter. \"Check your weap ... say! You\ncan't bring that animal in here!\"\n\nBuregarde said, \"He isn't bringing me. I'm here because I like it.\"\n\nThe woman's eyes bugged. \"What ... kind--?\"\n\n\"I am man's best friend--the noble dog of Barbarian Terra.\"\n\n\"Yes ... but--\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Peter airily, \"we're looking for a friend.\"\n\n\"Friend? Who is he?\"\n\n\"It's a she and her name is Vanessa Lewis.\"\n\n\"She ain't here.\"\n\n\"The dame's a liar-ess, Peter. I scent her strong.\"\n\n\"We'll just take a look around,\" said Peter to the check girl.\n\n\"You'll have to check your weapons.\"\n\n\"I'd rather go in naked. Sorry. Not today. Weapons happen to be my\nbusiness today. Come on, Buregarde.\"\n\n\n\nMan and dog started along the hallway warily. Buregarde said, \"Any\ntouch?\"\n\n\"Got a faint impression of alarm, danger, call out the guards.\"\n\n\"I scent violence,\" said the dog. \"And--\"\n\nThe door at the end of the hallway opened and a big man stepped out.\n\"What's going on here?\" he demanded flatly.\n\nThe check girl said, \"He wouldn't check ...\"\n\nThe big man reached for his hip pocket.\n\nPeter said, \"Take him high!\" and they plunged.\n\nPeter dove for the man's knees, Buregarde went in a three-stride lope\nlike an accordion folding and unfolding and then arched in a long leap\nwith his snarling fangs aimed at the man's throat. Man and dog hit him\nlow and high before he could open his mouth, before he could free the\nsnub pencil-ray. There was a short scrabble that ended when Buregarde\nlifted the man's head and whammed it down hard against the floor.\n\nWeakly, the check girl finished her statement, \"...His weapons!\" and\nkeeled over in a dead faint.\n\nBuregarde shook himself violently and worked his jaws, licking blood\nfrom his chops. Peter looked in through the open wall-door opposite the\ncheck counter; the racket had not been noticed by the roomful of\nspacemen and riffraff. The babble of a hundred tongues still went on\namid the clink of glasses and the disturbing strains of Xanabian music.\nSmoke from a hundred semi-noxious weeds lay in strata across the room,\nand at a table in the far corner two men faced one another, their\nexpressions a mixed pair. One held heavily begrudged admiration as he\npaid off five hundredweight of crystal-cut in the legal tender of\nXanabar to the other, whose expression was greedy self-confidence. One\nof His Excellency's Peacekeepers presided over the exchange. Coldly he\nextracted a fiftyweight from the pile and folded it into the signed and\ncompleted wager-contract. For his own coffer he extracted a fiveweight\nand slipped it into his boot top.\n\nPeter Hawley and Buregarde passed on, went through the far door dragging\ntheir late adversary ignominiously by the heels. Amid the lessened\npublicity of the distant hall, Peter checked the man and shrugged. \"He\nmay live,\" he said coldly, \"if he doesn't bleed to death.\"\n\n\"You really ought to take 'em on the high side,\" said Buregarde,\nplaintively. \"All I've got is my teeth to grab with. They don't bleed so\nbad from the ankle.\"\n\n\"They don't stay stopped that way either,\" said Peter harshly.\n\n\"You'd not be getting any praise from the Chief for that sort of\nbrutality.\"\n\n\"If Xanabar weren't rotten to the core, we wouldn't be plowing through\nit in the first place. Now, let's get going.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't you call for the rest of the crew?\"\n\n\"Not until I'm certain the girl's here. I'd hate to cut the city-wide\nsearch for cold evidence.\"\n\n\"She's here. I scent her.\"\n\n\"Maybe it's past tense, Buregarde. Or maybe it's another woman.\"\n\n\"Could be. But one thing: It is definitely Terrestrial woman.\" The dog\nsniffed again. \"You get anything?\"\n\n\"No more than before. It's close and they're the same set of impressions\nYet, any woman would be frantic with fear and concern.\"\n\n\"I ... _shhh_!\" Buregarde's sharp ears lifted instinctively at a distant\nsound not heard by the man. With a toss of his head, the dog folded one\near back, uncovering the inner shell. Like a sonic direction finder,\nBuregarde turned his head and listened.\n\n\"Man,\" he said finally with a low growling voice. \"Peter, there'll be\nhell to pay around here directly. He's stumbled over our recent\nconquest.\"\n\n\"Let's get cutting!\"\n\n\n\nPeter started trying doors and peering in; the dog raced on ahead of the\nman, sniffing deep at the bottom of each. It was the dog that found the\nroom. He called, \"Here!\" and Peter raced forward just as the fellow on\nthe stairs yelled something in his native tongue.\n\nPeter hit the door with the heel of his foot and slammed it open by\nsplintering the doorframe. The dog crouched low and poised; Peter\nslipped in and around feeling for a light-switch. From inside there was\na voiceless whimper of fright and from outside and below there came the\npounding of several sets of heavy feet. Peter found the switch and\nflooded the room with light. The girl--whether she was Miss Vanessa\nLewis or someone else, and kidnap-wise it was still a Terrestrial\ngirl--lay trussed on the bed, a patch of surgical tape over her mouth.\n\n\"Sorry,\" said Peter in a voice that he hoped was soothing. He reached,\nfreed a corner of the tape and ripped it off in a single swipe. The girl\nhowled. Peter slapped her lightly. \"Stop it!\" he commanded sharply.\n\"Vanessa Lewis?\"\n\n\"Yes, but--\"\n\n\"Call out the marines, Peter,\" snarled the dog.\n\n\"No! Bo! Back!\"\n\nReluctantly the dog backed into the room. He crouched low, poised to\nspring, with his nose just beyond the doorframe.\n\n\"Four of 'em,\" he whimpered pleadingly. \"I can get two--\"\n\n\"Well, I can't get the other two unless I'm lucky,\" snapped Peter.\n\"Don't be so eager to die for nothing, Buregarde.\"\n\n\"All this calculation,\" grumbled the dog sourly. \"I don't call it a loss\nif I get two for one.\"\n\n\"I call it a loss if I don't get four for nothing--or the whole damned\nEmpire of Xanabar for nothing, for that matter. We've a job to do and it\nain't dying--until Miss Lewis is out of this glorious citadel.\"\n\nThe girl looked from one to the other. They did not need any\nidentification; they were their own bona fides. Only man--Terrestrial\nMan--had intelligent dogs to work beside him. Period, question closed.\nBuregarde snarled at the door warningly while Peter stripped surgical\ntape from wrists and ankles.\n\nOutside, someone called, \"Come out or we blast!\"\n\nBuregarde snarled, \"Come in and we'll cut you to bits!\"\n\nThe quick flash of a pencil-ray flicked in a lance above the dog's nose:\nBuregarde snapped back as the lancet of light cut downward, then snapped\nforward for a quick look outside as the little pencil of danger\nflickered dark.\n\n\"Careful, Bo!\"\n\n\"You call the boys,\" snapped the dog. \"I'll--\"\n\n\n\nSomething came twisting forward to hit the doorframe, it dropped just\ninside the doorjamb. Buregarde leaped, snapped at the thing and caught\nit in midair, snapped his head in a vicious shake and sent it whirling\nback outside again before it could be identified. The dog sunfished and\nlanded on all four. Then the thing went off with a dull _pouf_! outside.\nThere was a gentle flash of quick light that was smothered by a billow\nof smoke. Buregarde leaped into the cloud and disappeared. There was a\nhoarse shriek and the mad scrabble of dog-claws on the hard floor, the\nsound of a heavy thud, and the angry snarl of a dog with its teeth\nfastened into something soft. Then there was the fast patter of dog-feet\nand Buregarde came around the door on a dead run, sliding side-wise to\ncarom off the opened door into safety just as a pencil-ray flicked to\nfollow him.\n\n\"Got him,\" said the dog in a satisfied tone. \"That's one!\"\n\nHe took his post by the doorframe again, the tip of his nose just\noutside. There was a consultation out there in the hallway, at which\nBuregarde called, \"Make a wild rush for us!\"\n\nMiss Lewis said, \"What are we going to do?\"\n\n\"Fight it out,\" said Peter. \"They can't win so long as we're alive now.\nI've got my crew on its way in a dead run, and if we make enough noise,\nsome of His Excellency's Peacemakers will step in and demand their cut\nof the finances.\" He grinned. \"How much are you worth, Miss Lewis?\"\n\nShe shuddered. \"I don't know how much father would pay--\"\n\n\"Hit 'em low, Peter!\" came Buregarde's snarl.\n\nThree of them came in a-slant, bounced shoulders against the opened\ndoor, caught their bearings and hell was out for noon. Buregarde caught\nthe first with a slash at the throat; they went down in a mad whirl of\ndog and thug, paws, tail, arms, legs and a spurt of blood. The second\nflicked his pencil-ray at Peter, its capsule charge faded to a mere\nsting before it cut into him. The third aimed a kick at the struggling\ndog. Vanessa Lewis snatched a box from the bureau and hurled it at the\nsecond. Peter thumbed his pencil-ray and winged the third man in the\nbiceps. Buregarde leaped for the second man's gun hand and closed on it\nas the hurled box opened and scatter-shotted his face with bric-a-brac.\nThe man with the bloody throat flailed out and caught Peter by the\nankle. Peter stomped his face with his other heel. Miss Lewis picked up\nthe table lamp and with a single motion turned off the light and\nfinished felling the one with the ray-burned shoulder.\n\nBuregarde dropped from the second man's wrist and crouched to spring.\nThe man cowered back, his good arm covering his throat and his other arm\nhanging limp. He mouthed fright-noises in some tongue native to some\nstar a thousand light-years across the galaxy.\n\nColdly, Peter stepped forward and belted him in the plexus.\n\n\"Now,\" he said calmly, \"we shall vacate the premises!\"\n\nThey went side by side, facing slightly outward, Buregarde between them\nand slightly ahead. \"We're coming out!\" called the dog. \"Three\nBarbarians from Terra!\"\n\n\n\nDown on the dark street, they met their mercenary again. He eyed them\nsourly. \"I see you were, in a sense, successful.\"\n\nPeter Hawley faced the mercenary. \"We were successful and would you like\nto make something of it?\"\n\n\"I'm going to have to arrest you, you know.\"\n\n\"You'll lose an arm trying!\" snapped the dog.\n\n\"There's murder been committed tonight,\" said His Excellency's\nPeacemaker. \"The Peace of Xanabar has been disturbed.\"\n\n\"Why you chiseling crook, there's been kidnaping tonight, and--\"\n\n\"I'm afraid that I shall have to ask that the young lady produce her\npassport,\" said the mercenary. \"Otherwise she's in Xanabar Citadel\nillegally.\"\n\nBuregarde said, \"Hit him low, Peter. Here come the boys.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Just once--for fun?\"\n\n\"No. I want our money-grubbing Peacekeeper to carry a message to His\nExcellency. I want His Excellency to read some Terrestrial History. Once\nupon a time there was a place called the Byzantine Empire that laid\nacross the trade routes. The upper crust of people used to serve the\nPresence of God in a golden throne whilst their underlings dealt in\nhuman slaves and procured comely concubines for the emperor; their\npolicemen took bribes and human life was cheap. And when Byzantium fell,\nall the world was forced to seek a new trade route. So tell His\nExcellency that he'd better clean up his own foul mess, or some\nbarbarians will clean it up for him.\"\n\n\"And that,\" said Buregarde, \"goes for your dad-ratted cat!\"",
