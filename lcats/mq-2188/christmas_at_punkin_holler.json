The necessary articles of furniture are the\nteacher\u2019s desk and chair, and a couple of long wooden benches, or\nsettees, if the benches are not to be easily obtained. The pupils are\nmoving around, talking, laughing, and romping; making considerable\nnoise and confusion. Miss Peppergrass enters, in hood and shawl, and\nspeaks, but fails to make herself heard. She removes her wraps, hanging\nthem on a nail near her desk, and rings bell smartly. School slowly\nbecomes quiet, but the pupils do not seat themselves. Instead, they\nstare, wonderingly, at teacher._\n\n\nMISS P.\u2014Take your seats.\n\nHIRAM\u2014Don\u2019t hafter. It\u2019s a hollerday.\n\nMISS P.\u2014I should say as much, judging by the noise you were making; but\nwe can not rehearse for the entertainment to-night in the midst of such\na racket as that. It sounded like a den of wild beasts.\n\nJACOB\u2014So \u2019twas, Teacher\u2014a regular circus. I\u2019m a lion, and I\u2019m a-goin\u2019\nto eat Sally up! (_Pounces on Sally, and begins to growl, and to\npretend to eat her. Sally screams._)\n\nMISS P.\u2014(_ringing bell again_) That will do, Jacob. Now, children, take\nyour seats. We must have it quiet. (_Children crowd into seats. Johnny\ntries to pass the end of one seat, but is held back by Lucindy. He\nstruggles._)\n\nMISS P.\u2014What\u2019s the trouble there, Lucindy?\n\nLUCINDY\u2014Johnny won\u2019t set down.\n\nJOHNNY\u2014No such a thing, Teacher. I was a-goin\u2019 ter set down, and she\ngrabbed onto me.\n\nLUCINDY\u2014He wasn\u2019t! He was a-goin\u2019 right by.\n\nJOHNNY\u2014Well, I was a-goin\u2019 to set down in my own seat. I don\u2019t like to\nset there.\n\nMISS P.\u2014But we are reserving the seats for the visitors. There will be\na great many here to-night, you know. Don\u2019t you want to be a little\ngentleman, and give up your seat to some one\u2014your mamma, perhaps?\n\nJOHNNY\u2014Huh! Ma couldn\u2019t git herself into _that_ seat. She\u2019s too fat.\nPa\u2019s a-goin\u2019 to bring a chair for her, \u2019cause she couldn\u2019t git into\n_any_ seat, \u2019thout you tooked away the desk first!\n\nMISS P.\u2014Well, some one may want it.\n\nJOHNNY\u2014They do. I want it.\n\nMISS P.\u2014(_sharply_) Well, you can\u2019t have it! Now sit down at once in\nthe place assigned you, or\u2014(_she takes a switch from her desk._)\n\nJOHNNY\u2014(_seating himself_) You don\u2019t give up your seat.\n\nMISS P.\u2014Ah, but I shall to-night, Johnny. I shall give it, as the seat\nof honor, to our supervisor, Mr. Barker. I shall be glad to give it to\nhim, Johnny.\n\nJAKE\u2014(_aside_) Sure she will. She\u2019s settin\u2019 her cap for him.\n\nMISS P.\u2014(_sharply_) What\u2019s that, Jacob?\n\nJAKE\u2014I wish you wouldn\u2019t call me Jay _Cup_. Nobody else ever did. I\u2019d\nas lief be called Jay Saucer, any day.\n\nMISS P.\u2014We won\u2019t argue the matter, Jacob. I asked you what you said to\nJohnny.\n\nJAKE\u2014I was jest a tellin\u2019 him thet you was more politer than him,\nthat\u2019s all.\n\nMISS P.\u2014Indeed! We will rehearse now, for this evening.\n\nSAMMY\u2014Be n\u2019t we a goin\u2019 ter trim that ere tree?\n\nPATTY\u2014We brung a heap o\u2019 popcorn, Teacher, all strung.\n\nBETSEY\u2014And we\u2019ve made paper chains, \u2019n tied up a lot o\u2019 but\u2019nuts in\ncolored paper.\n\nPETER\u2014\u2019N ma\u2019s made doughnuts \u2019n tied \u2019em up in blue ribbing.\n\nSAMMY\u2014Please can\u2019t we trim it fust?\n\nMISS P.\u2014No indeed, you must all rehearse your parts first.\n\nJACOB\u2014Can\u2019t we lug it in?\n\nSALLY\u2014Then we could look at it while we was \u2019hearsin\u2019.\n\nMISS P.\u2014It might take your attention. No, let it remain where it is for\nthe present.\n\nJOHNNY\u2014It wants ter be brung in here fer the presents. \u2019Sides, there\nain\u2019t no presents ben brung yit.\n\nMISS P.\u2014It must remain outside until after the rehearsal.\n\nSAMMY\u2014Somebody may steal it.\n\nMISS P.\u2014I hardly think so, with woods all around us. A tree would\nhardly be worth stealing, Sammy. Silence now.\n\nSAMMY\u2014(_aside_) Somebody may steal it, all the same.\n\nHIRAM\u2014Kin we rehearse in custum?\n\nMISS P.\u2014In what, Hiram?\n\nHIRAM\u2014In custom. In our other rigs\u2014our fol-de-rols \u2019n doodads that\nwe\u2019re go\u2019n ter wear to-night?\n\nMISS P.\u2014Oh, your costumes? Certainly, if you have brought them. (_Those\nwho are to change clothing, rush out, pellmell._)\n\nREUBEN\u2014Cuss is a bad swear word, Teacher. Ma licked me when I said it.\n\nMISS P.\u2014I should suppose she would. Little boys mustn\u2019t say naughty\nwords.\n\nREUBEN\u2014But you said it.\n\nMISS P.\u2014I? Oh no, Reuben, I wouldn\u2019t say a naughty word.\n\nREUBEN\u2014But you did say it, jest the same. You told \u2019em ter put on their\ncuss tunes, \u2019n ef it\u2019s bad ter call er cow a cuss, it\u2019s bad ter call a\ntune one.\n\nMISS P.\u2014Their costumes, Reuben. Their other clothes.\n\nREUBEN\u2014Oh! (_aside, as Aunt Hepsey enters_) But she did say it, \u2019n she\nsaid it agin.\n\nAUNT HEPSEY\u2014How de do, Miss Peppergrass! I thought I\u2019d jest drap in to\nhear the perliminaries, bein\u2019s I couldn\u2019t git out to-night.\n\nMISS P.\u2014(_offering chair_) You are very welcome, Miss Bascom. But do\ncome to-night.\n\nAUNT HEPSEY\u2014(_sitting down heavily_) Suz me, child, I dassn\u2019t! I kaint\nposserbly go out arter dark, count \u2019o my rheumatiz. Cripples me all up.\nI\u2019ll enjy it jest as well now, though, so jest go right ahead, same\u2019s\nef I warn\u2019t here.\n\nSAMMY\u2014Was that ere tree all right when you come in, Aunt Hepsy?\n\nAUNT HEPSY\u2014Land, yes, Sammy. Why shouldn\u2019t it be?\n\nLUCINDY\u2014Sammy\u2019s afraid a bear\u2019ll come along \u2019n eat it.\n\nSAMMY\u2014Haint neither, but I\u2019m worried \u2019bout that ere tree. Somebody\nmight steal it.\n\n(_Re-enter Hiram. He has pulled on the Santa Claus trousers over his\noveralls, and stuffed a pillow in front. He is endeavoring to place one\nbehind._)\n\nREUBEN\u2014That\u2019s a cuss tune all right.\n\nMISS P.\u2014Reuben!\n\nREUBEN\u2014Well, you say it.\n\nMISS P.\u2014I certainly did not. Say costume, Reuben.\n\nREUBEN\u2014You don\u2019t like it when I say it.\n\nMISS P.\u2014You haven\u2019t said it yet. Say it.\n\nREUBEN\u2014(_sulkily_) Cuss tune.\n\nMISS P.\u2014No, not cuss, cos. Cos-tume. Say it correctly or I shall punish\nyou.\n\nREUBEN\u2014Cuss, cuss tune.\n\nMISS P.\u2014(_shaking him_) Cos! Say cos.\n\nREUBEN\u2014(_whimpering_) Cu\u2014cuss\u2014cos!\n\nMISS P.\u2014(_shaking again_) Tume.\n\nREUBEN\u2014(_whimpering louder_) Tune.\n\nMISS P.\u2014No, tume. Now say costume.\n\nREUBEN\u2014Coss\u2014tume! Boo, hoo, hoo!\n\nMISS P.\u2014Now sit down and behave yourself. (_Reuben sits down, and\nsulks._) (_Hiram has been industriously stuffing in the back pillow,\nbut the front one has fallen on the floor._)\n\nHIRAM\u2014I kaint git on these ere britches ter save my gizzard.\n\nAUNT HEPSY\u2014Well, I sh\u2019d think you might, Hi, I sure do. They\u2019re big\nenough for old Paul Clear, let alone Hi Whittaker.\n\nHIRAM\u2014Big enough! Guess they be, Aunt Hepsy, but fast ez I git the\nfront piller in, aout it draps while I\u2019m a gittin\u2019 in the one behint.\n\nMISS P.\u2014Let me help you.\n\nHIRAM\u2014Guess I\u2019ll hafter, Teacher, sure. Nice big baby I be, kain\u2019t\ndress myself.\n\nMISS P.\u2014Bring in the tunic, and then we\u2019ll see.\n\nHIRAM\u2014The two whats?\n\nMISS P.\u2014The tunic. The blouse. The rest of the suit.\n\nHIRAM\u2014Oh, the jacket? But there ain\u2019t but one, less \u2019n you count the\nbelt.\n\nMISS P.\u2014Bring the whole of it here.\n\nHIRAM\u2014And the mask? \u2019N the cap \u2019n whiskers.\n\nMISS P.\u2014Yes, the whole of it, and hurry.\n\nAUNT HEPSEY\u2014Jest you come here, Hi. I\u2019ll fix you up. Go right on \u2019ith\nyour programmy, Miss Peppergrass. I\u2019ll tend ter him. I\u2019ve rigged many a\nSanty Claws in my day.\n\n(_She assists Hiram, while the rehearsal goes on._)\n\nMISS P.\u2014Now, children, we must get to work, or we will not be through\nby the time they want to trim the tree.\n\nSAMMY\u2014Somebody\u2019ll steal it afore then. Better bring it in, Teacher.\n\nMISS P.\u2014The tree is all right, Sammy. Now I have the programme all\narranged, and we will proceed just as we shall to-night. First will be\nthe welcome song.\n\nRHODA\u2014Ma says Ruby oughter say his welcome piece fust.\n\nMISS P.\u2014Oh no. We will sing first, then Reuben will speak his piece.\n\nREUBEN\u2014(_starting up_) I\u2019m a-goin\u2019 ter speak first. Ma said so.\n\nMISS P.\u2014Sit down, Reuben, till I call your name.\n\nREUBEN\u2014(_still standing_) Call it first, then. Ma says I gotter say it\nfirst.\n\nAUNT HEPSY\u2014Reckon he\u2019ll hafter, ef his ma says so.\n\nMISS P.\u2014I\u2019m running this school.\n\nAUNT HEPSY\u2014Mebbe so, mebbe so; but you don\u2019t know Hanner Ann Jenkins \u2019s\nwell \u2019s I do, or you\u2019d know thet ef she\u2019d made up her mind thet Ruby\nsh\u2019d speak first, she\u2019ll have him do it, ef it breaks up the whole\nentertainment. Hev\u2019n\u2019t you ever noticed thet Ruby was kinder sot in his\nways for a youngster? He takes it from his ma, she thet was Hanner Ann\nBean. I\u2019d let him say it fust, ef I was you, I really would.\n\nMISS P.\u2014But I have my programme all arranged.\n\nAUNT HEPSEY\u2014Change it, child. Ef \u2019twas jest Ruby, you could lick him\ninter mindin\u2019, but Hanner Ann is six feet high, \u2019n weighs over two\nhundred. Do let\u2019s have peace at Christmas time. \u2019N \u2019twill be anythin\u2019\nbut peace ef Ruby don\u2019t say that ere leetle varse fust.

At\n2, he bows to school. At 3, he points to side of room. At 4, he opens\nhis arms, flinging his hands widely apart. At 5, he clasps his hands,\nwith a loud clap, gazing upward. At 6, he smacks his lips. At 7, he\nbows again. At 8, he runs to seat._)\n\nRHODY\u2014He didn\u2019t say it right, teacher. It\u2019s \u201cHope I get a pretty toy.\u201d\n\nREUBEN\u2014Well, a jumpin\u2019 jack\u2019s a pretty toy, aint it? It\u2019s what I want,\nanyhow.\n\nRHODY\u2014Ma\u2019ll lick you, ef you say it so.\n\nTEACHER\u2014That will do, Rhoda. Let him fight it out with his mother\nhimself. If he gets a whipping, it\u2019s no more then he deserves.\n\nRHODY\u2014But Ma said for you to make him say it right.\n\nMISS P.\u2014If he\u2019s to say it when he pleases, he may say it as he pleases,\nfor all I care.\n\nAUNT HEPSY\u2014She\u2019ll skin him alive, ef he does say it wrong. Hanner Ann\nwrit that ere little varse herself, \u2019n she\u2019s prouder of it than a\nkitten with its fust mouse. Better say \u201cpretty toy,\u201d Ruby, ef your ma\nsays so.\n\nREUBEN\u2014A jumpin\u2019 jack is a pretty toy.\n\nMISS P.\u2014We will now sing our welcome song. (_Several begin to sing, in\ndifferent keys. Miss P. raps on her desk and they stop._)\n\nMISS P.\u2014No, no, children. Wait till I give you the key. I will start\nthe songs, and you must wait for me. Why, what would people think if\nyou started in like that, all out of tune?\n\nAUNT HEPSY\u2014Think it was a lot o\u2019 sheep a blartin\u2019, most likely.\n\n(_Children laugh.

(_Miss P.\nsimpers_) You never writ it your own self, did you? Wal, I guess\nthat\u2019ll take the wind outen Hanner Ann Jenkinses sails. I allers\nthought a heap o\u2019 po\u2019try, myself, but I s\u2019posed it took a lot o\u2019\nbrains to write it. Did it take you days \u2019n days? And what was all the\nflumadoodles with their hands for?\n\nMISS P.\u2014Why, motion songs are very popular in the cities, I\u2019ve heard,\nso I thought we would give some at our entertainment.\n\nAUNT HEPSY\u2014Yes, indeedy! Punkin Holler allers did pride itself on\nkeepin\u2019 right up to date. We\u2019re no hayseeders in this commoonerty.\n\nMISS P.\u2014Don\u2019t you think the motions were very graceful?\n\nAUNT HEPSY\u2014I haint a doubt they was, Miss Peppergrass, not a mite o\u2019\ndoubt; but I was so flabbergasted at hearin\u2019 them ere new words sung to\nthet old tune and so dumfounded at seein\u2019 all them young \u2019uns a wavin\u2019\ntheir paws, wild like, in the air, thet I never once noticed if it war\ngraceful. It sure was, though, an\u2019 that\u2019s a fact.\n\nMISS P.\u2014Next will be a recitation by Lucinda Lowe. An old poem, with\nnew variations. (_Lucinda advances, bows very low, and recites.

He lives in a big snow house,\nbuilt around the North Pole, and uses the Pole for a flag staff. He is\nvery fat and jolly, with a big ponderosity in front. His belt is so\nlong it has to be made to order. His eyes are the kind that twinkle\nand laugh all by themselves. His nose is round and red, like a little\napple. His cheeks are, too, what you can see of \u2019em. They are mostly\ncovered by his whiskers. His whiskers are very predominant. They grow\nas thick as a crop of well fertilized clover in a good hay year. His\nhair is long, thick, and curly, so that if he bumps his head gett_ing_\ndown a chimbley, it won\u2019t hurt him none\u2014I mean not any. These hair and\nwhiskers are of a sandy color, which is one reason he is called _Sandy_\nClaws. The other reason is because he has claws.\n\nAUNT HEPSEY\u2014Hold on there, Betsey!
