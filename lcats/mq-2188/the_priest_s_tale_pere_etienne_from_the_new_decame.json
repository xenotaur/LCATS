    "body": "PERE ETIENNE came aboard at Dares-Salaam and did not at once make\nfriends. It was our own fault, however. He neither obtruded nor effaced\nhimself, but rather went quietly on his own way with that recollection\nwhich the clerical system of the Catholic Church encourages. We\nfew first-class passengers had already settled down into the usual\nregularities of shipboard life, from the morning constitutional in\npyjamas on the boat deck, to the Bridge four after dinner in the\nsmoke-room, and, besides, it was plain that Pere Etienne was not likely\nto have much in common with any of us. So we were polite at a distance,\nlike Englishmen everywhere. Even I, who, by virtue of my cloth, might\nhave been supposed to make advances, was shy of beginning. I was young\nin those days, and for one thing spelt Rome always with a big capital.\n\nBut from the first there was something which attracted me to the priest,\nthe more so as it was hard to define. In his appearance there was\nnothing to suggest interest. His age was round about fifty; his hair\nbrown, though in his beard a white hair or two was to be observed. In\nhis short black coat and trousers he looked neither mediaeval nor\na traveller, and his luggage was neither romantically minute nor\ninterestingly large. He was booked from Dar-es-Salaam to Bombay, and\nthe purser professed neither to know whence he came nor whither he went\nbeyond those two fixed points.\n\nYet I was attracted. I have no wish to bore you, so that I shall not\ndwell upon the point, but in my opinion it was interesting. There are\nsome people who carry an atmosphere with them as they go their own\nindividual way about the world, and there are others who can instantly\nperceive it. I am not speaking of clairvoyance; I dislike that jargon;\nbut I do know that I was conscious of Pere Etienne if he did but pass\nthe smoke-room door when I was about to play a doubled four in No\nTrumps.\n\nWell, our old British India tramp lay about for a week in Dar-es-Salaam\nharbour, rolled up to Tanga, and finally crossed over to Zanzibar,\nwithout further developments. There we passengers went sweltering about\nthe narrow streets, visited duly the coconut and clove plantations, and\nconceived ourselves to be exploring by hiring a car, crossing the island\nto Chuaka, and spending a day up the creek. Pere Etienne went at once\nto the Catholic Mission and remained there. Thus it was not until the\nevening on which we sailed that we saw him again.\n\nIt was half an hour or so before sunset, and a serene beauty lay over\nland and sea. There was the gentlest breeze, and at our moorings it\nwas almost cool. We were clustering on the landward side of the ship,\nsmoking and watching the town and harbour. Close up under the tall white\nhouses the blue sea broke in tiny creamy ripples on the sand or the\nlow coral rocks, and, with its green woods to right and left, the\ncity seemed to dream in the sun. One could see, however, that it was\npreparing to wake. A flutter of orange or scarlet on the flat roofs here\nand there told that the women were already coming up to enjoy the cooler\nhours; and between the thin cassuarinas in the square that opened to the\nsea before the Sultan's Palace, a white-robed crowd was gathering for\nthe faint excitement of the sunset gun. Between ship and shore, the\nbrown-timbered rough-hewn native boats came and went on their long\noars, and in smarter skiffs the silk and curio merchants were taking\na lingering leave of us. From the south a dozen peaceful lateen-sailed\ndhows beat up for the native anchorage behind which, from our view-point,\nthe twin spires of the Catholic cathedral stood out against an opal sky.\nDespite travellers' tales, there is only one mosque with a minaret in\nZanzibar, and that so small and hidden that it is scarcely visible from\nthe sea.\n\nWatching the dhows and sighting the cathedral, suggested, I suppose,\nPere Etienne. Someone asked if his reverence had come aboard, but no one\nknew. Lazily turning the question and answer over in my mind, I became\naware that I was sure he had. The persistent intuition grew on me.\nWithout speaking of it, I determined, out of sheer curiosity, to go and\nsee. I detached myself from the group unobtrusively, and strolled off\nround the deck.\n\nSure enough on the seaward side I saw him. He was sitting in a\ndeck-chair and looking out across the water. At first I thought he was\ngazing intently at nothing, but as I too looked, I made out, across the\nstrait, the dim outline of the Sham-balla Mountains on the mainland\nthat are sometimes visible for a little at sunset and dawn. The priest's\nchair was drawn close to the bulwark, and almost before I knew what I\nwas doing, I was leaning against it in an attitude which allowed me,\ntoo, to see those distant peaks and at the same time to converse easily,\nif it should be permitted.\n\n\"Hullo, father,\" I said; \"we were wondering if you had come aboard.\"\n\nHe looked at me, smiling. \"I believe I was one of the first,\" he\nreplied, in his excellent English.\n\n\"Saying good-bye to Africa?\" I queried, half jocularly.\n\n\"Yes, I expect so.\"\n\nThe tone of his voice suggested far more than the words themselves\nexpressed. It aroused my curiosity. \"For long?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well, I don't suppose I shall see those peaks again. I saw them first\ntwenty-seven years ago, a young priest on his first mission, and I have\nnot seen them from the sea since. Now I have been ordered to India to my\nsecond mission, and it is not very likely that I shall be moved\nagain. It is still less likely that I shall return. After so long an\nacquaintance, it is natural that I should want to say good-bye.\"\n\nI think I was slightly incredulous. \"Do you mean you have been over\ntwenty-seven years up there without leave?\" I questioned.\n\n\"Twenty-seven next month, there and beyond.\"\n\nI have told you that I was young in those days, and I did not then know\nof the heroic sacrifices of Catholic missionaries. Moreover, I too was\ntaking a first leave--after two years' service, according to our plan.\nAnd I was eagerly looking forward to a visit to my married sister in\nIndia, and a journey home after that. Stupidly enough, it took me a few\nseconds to swallow those twenty-seven years; but for all that my mind\nworked quickly. Twenty-seven years of tinned food, mosquitoes, heat,\nnatives, and packing-case furniture! That was how I read it. \"Well,\"\nI said at last, \"I should think you were glad to go anywhere after all\nthat time.\"\n\n\"Eh? Oh, I don't know. No, that's wrong; I do know. I'm sorry, that's\nthe truth.\"\n\n\"You like Africa?\"\n\nThe Frenchman showed himself in the half-humorous shrug of the\nshoulders, but the missionary spoke. \"It has become my home, and its\npeople my people,\" he said.\n\nI turned the saying over in my mind before I spoke again. Then interest\nand attraction overcame my hesitation, and I abandoned all pretence\nof making a chance conversation. \"Father,\" I said, \"I expect you have\ntravelled a good deal up there and seen many things. Tell me a\nlittle about it all. I've seen enough to be very interested in your\nexperiences. May I pull up a chair and may we talk?\"\n\nHis brown eyes twinkled, \"Certainly,\" he said, \"especially if you will\ngive me a fill of that English tobacco you're smoking. Years ago I\nlearned to smoke English tobacco, but it hasn't too often come my way.\"\n\nI threw him my pouch with a laugh and went to find a chair. That was the\nbeginning of many conversations, but none of his stories interested me\nmore than the one he told me that night. He had half hinted of strange\nhappenings away back there in remote districts, as well as of more\ncommonplace although sufficiently interesting journeys and adventures,\nand it was to the less usual that I was drawn that evening. There was\nthat about Pere Etienne which made one feel that the commonplace world\nwas of secondary importance, and that he, like the poet at Charing\nCross, might find Jacob's ladder reaching heavenward in any place. Thus,\nwhile the light died swiftly out of the sky and the stars shone out\nover that far-off range which runs up to the Para Mountains and giant\nKilimanjaro and that far-flung plain which lies embraced beyond, between\nthem and the great lakes, I put my question and he answered it. \"Tell me\nthe queerest of all the queer things you have seen, father,\" I said.\n\n\"Queer?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I. \"Unusual, I mean. Not necessarily supernatural, and not\nhorrible. But the thing, perhaps, that more than all else draws your\nmind back to Africa.\"\n\n\"You ask a big thing,\" he said, smiling friendlily.\n\n\"And I believe you can answer it,\" said I, impulsively.\n\nHe nodded more gravely. \"I believe I can,\" he said.\n\n\"I shall tell you a little story that seems to me singularly arresting\nand tender. True, I believe that it may arrest me because it occurred\nin a village--or perhaps I should say a town--which I have visited\nbut once though I have often tried to get back to it again. Now I shall\nnever go. Very likely it is for that reason, then, that it lingers in my\nmemory as a place of great beauty, though in my opinion there are other\ncauses. However, let me begin by describing it to you.\n\n\"From the slopes of Kilimanjaro you can look westwards to Mweru, a still\nactive volcano little known and rarely visited, and from Mweru a chain\nof heights runs west once more till they end abruptly almost in a\nprecipice that descends to the plain. At its foot rises a small river,\nbubbling up from half a dozen springs in a slight depression, and\nflowing swiftly off, very clear and cool, towards the great lake which\nis visible on the horizon from the mountain behind. Just below the pool\nof the source, on the right bank, shaded with trees, ringed with\ngiant aloes and set in fields of millet and maize, stands a somewhat\nremarkable native town. There is stone in the hills, and the natives\nhave drawn and worked it for their huts--not a usual thing in tropical\nAfrica. They may, of course, have learned the lore themselves, or some\nwandering Arab traders may have taught them; but I have another idea,\nas you shall hear. Be that as it may, there the neat houses stand--grey\nwalls, brown thatch, small swept yards of trodden earth before them\nwithin the rings of neat reed fencing. Great willows grow along the bank\nand trail their hanging tendrils in the water, and the brown kiddies\nswing from them and go splashing into the stream with shouts of delight.\nThe place is remote, and in a corner out of the path of marauding\ntribes. Not too easy to find, its folk are peaceable, and I can see\nit again as I saw it on my first visit when, from the height of the\nprecipice behind, I could make out the thin spires of smoke rising on\nthe evening air and just perceive the brown herds of cattle drifting\nslowly homewards to the protecting kraals.\n\n\"The tribe is a branch of the Bonde, iron workers and a settled folk.\nHow they came to be there, so far north and west of the main stock of\ntheir people, I do not know, but of course one comes across that kind\nof thing fairly commonly and the explanation is nearly always the same.\nFear of some kind drove out a family who wandered, like Abram from\nCharron, until they found a promised land. These folk knew that they\ncame from the south and east a long long time ago; more they neither\nknew nor cared to know. They were not many in number, and although\nArab _safaris_ had passed by, they were not enough to tempt a permanent\ntrader to cross the barren lands north and south, or dare the mountain\nway from Mweru. The chief's oldest councillor spoke to me of a\nslave-raid that had been defeated when he was a young man, but since\nthen they had dwelt in peace. No European had been there within living\nmemory.\n\n\"Such was, and may be still, the town of Mtakatifuni, as I shall call\nit. Do you know Ki-Swahili?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"Then the name will do, and not spoil my tale. Let me but tell you how\nI came to be there and I will make haste about it. I was exploring.\nAh, but once in all the years have I been able to explore! Usually we\nmissionaries hurry from place to place on an unending round till the\ncircle is as big as we can possibly manage. Then a new centre must be\nmade, and it was because my Order had determined on a new centre that my\nopportunity came. The Vicar Apostolic was doubtful as to the direction\nin which we should expand. He sent me, therefore, west beyond Mweru to\nsee what could be seen, and another farther south on the same errand.\nThe folk were few about Mweru, but I heard a rumour of Mtakatifuni,\nmuch exaggerated, and set out to find it. Foolishly I went west until\nsupplies were so low that it would have been fatal to turn back over the\nbare mountains by which we had come, and our only hope lay in pushing\non. And so I reached my hidden town, stayed a while, and returned\nanother way, to find that the other explorer had a report to make\nof more peopled and easier lands which found greater favour with his\nlordship. And rightly. When labourers are so few and the field is so\nbig, it is necessary to settle where the work offers most prospect of\nlarge returns. So was I permitted to see, but not to enter in.\"\n\nHe leant forward to knock out his pipe, blew down it, refused more\ntobacco, and re-settled himself. \"Ah, well,\" he said philosophically,\n\"le Bon Dieu knows best. I do not believe He has forgotten Mtakatifuni.\n\n\"Where was I? Oh yes, I remember. We saw the place then, in the evening,\nand next morning journeyed early towards it. You must understand that we\nwere spent. I cannot recall better water than that at the source of that\nlittle river, and the roasted mealies they gave us, and sour milk, how\ngood it all was! The chief had sent word that we were to be fed and\ngiven an empty house, and after I had eaten I went to see and thank him.\nI put on my cassock and with it my beads about my waist, and I carried\nmy breviary in my hand, for I thought he might keep me waiting in the\nnative fashion and that I could say my office in the meantime.\n\n\"But he received me at once. The ground rose a little and was built up\ntoo before his group of huts, terraced roughly and faced with stone,\nwith steps at one end. A big block of stone stood near the edge of it,\nso that standing behind one looked east over the town to the mountains,\nand it was there, after a little, that I offered the Holy Sacrifice each\nremaining day of my stay. There was little linen in the place, and he\nstood to greet me at the top of the steps, clad in prepared skins, a\nyoungish man and a fine figure of a savage king. He gave me later the\ntwisted iron spear of state that he carried that day. It hangs in our\nchurch of the Holy Cross now, behind the altar of the Sacred Heart.\nSurely the Good God will not forget Mtakatifuni.\n\n\"Well, he greeted me courteously, with reserve, but with a suggestion\nof curious eagerness. I marked it at once. Not, however, till the usual\nquestions as to my journeys and so on were over, did I get a clue to the\ncause of it. But then, when we were seated on stools by the great stone\nI have mentioned, big clay beakers of thin, delicious light beer beside\nus, he put a question. 'Why have you been so long a time coming, my\nfather?' he asked. 'A little later and you would have been too late.'\n\n\"I was slightly puzzled, but I supposed he referred to the length of my\njourney. 'The way was long and rough, chief,' said I.\n\n\"'But why were you so long in setting out?' he persisted. 'Mwezi has\nbeen expecting you for many years.' He turned to an old councillor. 'How\nmany years has Mwezi been expecting the father?'\n\n\"'Since the days of the Great One, the father of the King,' said the old\nman. 'Mwezi came first among us when I was a boy.'\n\n\"Now most of this was Greek to me, but the speaker was fifty if he was a\nday, whatever allowance was to be made for the early ageing of Africans,\nand you may imagine that I understood enough to be surprised. 'How\ncould that be, chief?' I asked. 'When this old man was a boy, I had not\ncrossed the black water to come to this land, and possibly I had not\nbeen born. Truly of this Mwezi I knew nothing, but how could he expect\nme whom even my mother had not seen?'\n\n\"The chief looked worried, and stared at me for awhile in silence. Then\nhe nodded thoughtfully. 'It is true,' he said. 'The father is doubtless\nwise and has seen years, but his beard is not white and the thing is\nstrange. Nevertheless he wears the black robe and the dried beans, and\nhe carries the book in his hand, even as Mwezi has said. Still, I have\nsent for Mwezi, and doubtless he will explain the matter. See, he comes;\nslowly, for he is very old. Does the father not remember him at all?'\n\n\"He pointed down the path that led up to us from the town, into which\nhad come a small crowd of natives who were eagerly following three or\nfour figures, jostling each other to get a better view. It soon became\nplain that a young man led the way, and that after him came three of\nwhom I guessed the central person to be Mwezi. I think he was the oldest\nnative I have ever seen, bent, shrivelled, and stiff-jointed, but with\nkeen dark eyes which, a little later, fixed themselves inquiringly on my\nface and then clouded with acute disappointment. On either side his sons\nhelped him with a hand beneath his arm-pits, and he himself walked by\nmeans of a great stick. The crowd of hangers-on stopped respectfully\nbelow, but these four climbed up to the dais. A stool was brought for\nthe old man, but at first he would not sit. He stood there, staring at\nme and shaking his head. 'It is not he,' he said, 'it is not he. Yet he\nis like, very like. But it is not he.'\n\n\"I was still perplexed at all this, but by this time a little amused.\nNevertheless I hid that, for the old fellow was so plainly disappointed.\n\n\"'Come, father,' I said. 'I am very sorry, but will you not explain?\nPerhaps it is a brother of mine whom you have seen. Seat yourself and\ntell me about it.'\n\n\"He did not seem at once to comprehend, but when his sons had persuaded\nhim to sit, he made a peremptory motion with his stick towards the old\ncouncillor who had spoken before. This individual glanced at the\nchief for permission, and having received it, told me this story at\nconsiderable length.\n\n\"He said that, very many years before, in the time of the late king, the\nvillage had been one day thrown into a state of great excitement by the\nadvent of a stranger. This had been Mwezi, at the time a man of middle\nage. He had come from the south and west--from Central Africa, that\nis--and he had said that he was seeking a white man whom it had been\nshown him he should find in that village. Pressed for details, he\nannounced that he had come from a town far away by a wide river where\nthere were great falls over whose rocks the water thundered night and\nday in a perpetual cloud of spray. One night he had awakened in his hut,\nand had seen a white man standing before him dressed in a black robe, a\nstring of beads, and carrying a book. Behind the white man he could see,\nas it were, the vision of a town, a river, a precipice--in short,\nwhat he now saw to have been Mtakatifuni. The figure had beckoned him\nsolemnly, and he had sat up in his bed in fear. It had beckoned again,\nand had then pointed north and east, and at that the vision had died\naway before the startled sleeper's eyes. But Mwezi understood. In his\nmind there had been no question as to what he must do. In the dawn he\nhad risen, said good-bye to his wife and family, and set out. For two\nyears he had journeyed, wandering from place to place, scarcely knowing\nwhither he went save that it was always north and east. The very wild\nbeasts had respected him, and men, seeing the vision in his eyes,\nhad withheld their hands from him. At length, then, he had reached\nMtakatifuni. There, as always, he had inquired for his white man, and,\nhearing that no white man had ever been there but convinced that it was\nthe place of his dream, he sat down to wait. He had grown old waiting;\nhad married, and had begotten sons and daughters. Now he was too old to\nmove; all but too old to live; but still he waited. Still he believed he\nwould see his white man again before he died; indeed, he could not\ndie until he had seen. My coming had seemed to the whole place the\nfulfilment of his vision, but I was not the man. Mwezi was sure of that\nand no one doubted him. And maybe, now, added the councillor, he would\nnever see him. That was all.\n\n\"Now I had been long enough in Africa to set little store by native\ndreams as a rule. The affair, then, seemed to me pathetic rather than\ninteresting.\n\n\"My eyes kept straying to the old fellow while the story was being\ntold me, and I marvelled to think of the simplicity of his faith, the\nweariness of his journey into the unknown, and the tenacity with which\nhe had clung to his obsession. That this man should have given his whole\nlife to such a quest, and should now be so bitterly disappointed when\na remote chance had brought it nearer realisation than had been in the\nleast degree likely, was indeed certainly cruel. I therefore turned to\nhim to make what amends I could.\n\n\"'But, old Mwezi,' I said as kindly as possible, 'doubtless you are\nmistaken. It was but once that you saw the figure in your dream, and\nthat years ago. You dreamt of a white man dressed as I. Well, I belong\nto a regiment of white men who dress alike, and for many lives it has\nbeen the custom of that regiment to dress so. Doubtless as a boy you had\nseen one of my brethren, or perchance a picture of one, and your spirit\nsaw him again in a dream. If I am right, and your home is on that great\nriver which we white men call the Zambesi, then it is not unlikely that\nsuch a thing happened. Perhaps you have forgotten. Now in me you see him\nwhom you seek.'\n\n\"The old fellow's keen eyes flashed angrily. 'The white stranger mocks\nme,' he said.\n\n\"I protested. 'No, father, I do not mean to mock you. Why should I do\nso? But come now, can you describe the face of the man you saw?'\n\n\"'I can, and easily. His beard was white and not as thine. Moreover, he\nwas bald-headed, and beneath his right eye was there a little scar such\nas he had perhaps received in the hunt from some beast or the other. His\nface was long and thin, and his nose bigger. Am I a child that I should\nnot know one man from another? Thou art not he.'\n\n\"It was foolish of me, but I was surprised out of all caution. 'How\ncould you see so much in the dark of your hut?' I exclaimed.\n\n\"Mwezi rose to his feet and made a pathetic effort to hold his head\nerect. With true native dignity, he ignored me and turned to the chief.\n'With the leave of the chief, I go,' he said. 'I am old and would rest\nin my place. Fare thee well, father of thy people. The Heavens guard\nthee. Be in peace.'\n\n\"I realised that I had blundered, but at the moment there was nothing to\ndo. We watched the procession move away again almost in silence, and I\nnoticed curiously that the crowd were even more interested in Mwezi than\nin myself, a white stranger. When he was out of sight, I apologised to\nthe chief, who, however, would not hear that I had done any wrong. He\nhimself showed me back to the house set apart for us and invited me to\nfeast with him in the evening. He gave me leave to speak to his people,\nand I remember that I was so dog-tired that I lay down at once and slept\nfor the rest of the day.\n\n\"In the morning, however, I remembered Mwezi, and told the chief that\nI would like to go and call on him. I determined to do what I could\nfor the old fellow's peace of mind, and, with a guide and one of my own\nboys, we set out.\n\n\"The way led through the native huts and without them. It was downhill\ngoing, as the village, in African fashion, was built on the side of a\nrise which culminated in the chief's hut, while Mwezi lived, very close\nto the source of the river I have mentioned. We emerged through trees\ninto a grassy open space of perhaps thirty paces wide, and I saw at once\nthe old fellow sitting at the door of his hut beneath the shade of a\nwild vine which grew luxuriantly over the porch and roof. I was too much\noccupied in greeting him to take note at once of the building, but when\nwe were seated, and he had been thawed out of his first coolness, I\nlooked more closely at it. It interested me. It was long in shape, much\nlonger than the usual native hut, and with three windows narrow and\npointed, one of them now roughly blocked with sods. I examined the\nstones of the walls, getting up to do so. They struck me as being old\nand much more carefully laid than is usual in native work.\n\n\"'Did you build this house yourself, old man?' I asked. 'It is well\nmade.'\n\n\"'I did not build it,' he said. 'I found it here. When I came to\nMtakatifuni, it was empty and had been empty for long. There was no roof\nto it in those days, and few came near the place. But that suited me.\nMy mind was full of him whom I had seen, and my spirit told me that\nI should await him here. The father of the chief then gave it me, no\ncouncillor knowing aught about it.'\n\n\"'And you planted this vine and cleared this space, perhaps?'\n\n\"'I did not. I did but train the vine which had blocked the door, and\ncut down for the wood of the roof the young trees that had grown here.\nBut some other had cleared the ground before me.'\n\n\"'Would you mind if I looked within, Mwezi?' I questioned, for to tell\nyou the truth my curiosity was thoroughly aroused.\n\n\"The old fellow got up courteously. 'Enter, white man,' said he. 'My\nsons shall bring the stools and fetch us beer. I am old and poor, but\nyou are welcome. You are at least of the people of him I saw, and shall\nI, in my sorrow, forbid you to come in?'\n\n\"We entered. The place was divided into two by a sod partition, plainly\nrecent in construction, and I looked disappointedly at what I could see.\nThere were the usual scant furnishings of a native hut--a _kitanda_,\nsome pots, a stool or two, a few spears in a corner. But when I passed\nround the partition, my interest increased tenfold. I even cried out in\nmy astonishment.\n\n\"I saw what I had not been able to see from the fact of my approach\nfrom the west of the clearing. The eastern end of the hut was not built\nsquarely as the other, but roughly rounded in what elsewhere I should\nunhesitatingly have called an apse, and since on either side there were\nstill visible a couple of those narrow pointed windows, while the floor\nspace was practically empty, the suggestion of a chapel was complete. I\nought, perhaps, to have guessed it before, but the thought burst on me\nsuddenly. The situation, near the stream rather than up on the hill,\nthe orientation, the unusual length, the vine, the clearing--everything\npointed in the same direction. And then the old man's story. I was\nfrankly amazed.\n\n\"I turned and saw him standing in the doorway, his hand on the mud wall\nfor support, his eyes peering at me from his bowed head. If I had been\nmomentarily suspicious of a knowledge hitherto kept from me, all fled\nat the sight of him. He was transparently honest and eager. 'What is it,\nwhite man?' he quavered.\n\n\"'Mwezi,' said I, 'here is a strange thing and a wonder. You tell me\nthat you saw in your vision a white man, and I know from what you say\nthat he was a priest. You travelled far, and your spirit sent you\nhere. Well, I do not doubt that this house of yours was once a place of\nworship, and I think it was built by white priests. Think now, have you\nheard of no such thing?'\n\n\"He swayed a little as he stood, and did not answer at once. Then he\nslowly shook his head. 'I have heard nothing, nothing,' he said. 'If it\nbe so, none know of these things, white man. Art thou sure? Thou wouldst\nnot mock me again.'\n\n\"'Mwezi,' I cried eagerly, 'I do not mock you. Why should I do any such\nthing? I cannot yet tell certainly, but this place is such as we build\nfor prayers, and we may yet make sure. May I search more diligently?'\n\n\"'Do what thou wilt, my son,' said he, 'and if my hands cannot, my\nspirit will help thee.'\n\n\"There and then I began a close scrutiny. I went outside, measured,\ntapped, sought, but I found nothing more. If there had ever been a\nstoup, a cross, a rude piscina, they had long since gone. But the more\nI searched, the more sure grew my conviction that the place had been a\nchapel. At last I sat down to rest, and while resting, I had an idea.\n\n\"'Mwezi,' I said, 'have you ever dug up the floor?'\n\n\"He shook his head. 'Why should I dig it up?' he asked.\n\n\"'Would you allow me to do so?' I queried.\n\n\"He looked doubtful. 'But why?' he asked again, suspiciously. 'And would\nyou dig even now?'\n\n\"I laughed. 'Well, not at once,' I said. 'We must find a new house for\nyou first. But if I am right, it may be that things are buried here,\nor that there are stones which will tell me a tale. See, the floor is\nhigher now than it was. There was a step here at the door, and the mud\nhas nearly covered it.'\n\n\"'It is but the smearing,' he said, half contemptuously.\n\n\"That roused me. Of course I know the native habit of cleaning a house\nby putting down a fresh layer of mud mixed with a little dung, which in\ntime raises the floor considerably. But I was not to be put off by\nthat. Below the smearing of the old man's time might be a layer of earth\nthrown in to hide something. I glanced round. 'May I borrow a spear?' I\nasked.\n\n\"He nodded, and I selected one from the corner with a long thin blade.\nThen I went into the inner room, and he came and stood again to watch me\nwith his peering old eyes. Under his scrutiny, I began in the apse and\nthrust downward as far as I could. The blade sank to its hilt fairly\neasily, and that was all.\n\n\"Thus I stabbed until I came to the string of the apse, and then, almost\nat once, I made a discovery. The point of the blade struck a stone. A\nfoot to the left, it touched again, and a foot more. In a few minutes I\nwas all but certain that a stone slab was buried there. You may imagine\nmy excitement.\n\n\"Mwezi called his sons and sent one for a native hoe. When he returned,\nwe all gathered about the place while he slowly dug up the trampled mud.\nIn a few minutes a stone slab was being exposed to view, and with my\nspear I got to work scraping off the earth while he dug free the other\nend. Suddenly, as I scraped, I made out a cross, and to cut the story\nshort, we laid bare at length what had undoubtedly been an altar-stone.\nEvery one of the five crosses were plainly visible, and left no room for\nquestion.\n\n\"We stopped out of breath, and I explained something of its use. At that\nMwezi spoke suddenly, calling our attention to him. 'Lift it, lift it,'\nhe cried. 'Lift it at once.'\n\n\"The old man was a striking spectacle. His withered face was simply\nalive with emotion. He was kneeling on hands and knees, and his thin\nfingers worked at the edge of the slab. Something in his voice compelled\nus, and we got at once to work. After all it was an easy task, for it\nwas soon apparent that the stone was fitted into brick, with which\nthe whole place was paved, and with spade and spear we levered it up a\nlittle. Then two of Mwezi's sons got their fingers under it, and without\nany great effort raised it completely. They staggered aside with it and\nthe rest of us peered within. For a second we looked, and then Mwezi\ngave a great cry.\n\n\"'My father, my father! Lo, I have come to thee, as thou didst bid.\nThese many years have I waited, for my spirit spoke true, bidding me\nrest above thee. Now will I pass on whither thou art passed, and as thou\nhadst understanding, so it shall befall. Lo, I come to thee, seeking\npeace!'\n\n\"His voice hesitated, and failed, and he fell forward very gently and\nslowly till his head rested on his hands on the edge of the tomb. None\nof us dared to move for a few seconds, for Mwezi's voice rang so truly\nand convincingly. Great awe fell on us all, for he had spoken as one who\ncertainly saw. Then I stretched out my hand and touched him, but he had\ngone, as he said. And on his face was peace.\n\n\"That is all there is to tell in a way. For inside the grave, if grave\nit were, there was nothing at all that it was given to our eyes to\nsee--not a bone, not a shred of a habit, nor book nor beads. If ever a\nbody or treasures of any sort had been there, the receptacle had been\nrifled long before, and entirely forgotten. So there is literally no\nmore to tell. Of course the affair made great excitement. The chief and\nall his people came to see, and came once again the day after when I\nlowered Mwezi into the grave and replaced the altar stone. After that\nthe door and the windows were blocked up at my request, against the\nday of the coming of the Faith once more to Mtaka-tifuni. For that, the\nspace about the sanctuary is to be kept clear of undergrowth, by order\nof the chief. For that old Mwezi waits beneath the altar, and maybe he\nwhom he saw waits also.\"\n\nThe dinner bugle had sounded a few moments before Pere Etienne had\nfinished, and now we rose to go. We stood a second, and I gazed over\nthe side at the star-shine on the water, for the night was fine. When\nI looked up, Pere Etienne was staring out into the darkness, a far-away\nlook on his face, but he must have felt my eyes on him, for he turned\nquickly and smiled. Possibly he read a question I rather wanted to ask,\nbut did not dare. Anyway, he smiled, as I say, and shook his head. \"I\nhave lived too long in Africa to have theories, my friend,\" he said,\n\"but to me the memory of Mwezi and his chapel is a very precious thing.\nWe are all of us souls on pilgrimage, and we rarely understand why or\nhow, or remember that we have a Guide. But I like to think in the end,\nthe Good God willing, we shall find a hidden sanctuary and that we have\nbeen led to a place prepared.\"",
