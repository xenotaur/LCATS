mirrors Him must some day die,\n  Make plain the reason tortured Tantalus\n  Is baited by the fickle fruit, declare\n  If merely brute caprice dooms Sisyphus\n  To struggle up a never-ending stair.\n  Inscrutable His ways are, and immune\n  To catechism by a mind too strewn\n  With petty cares to slightly understand\n  What awful brain compels His awful hand.\n  Yet do I marvel at this curious thing:\n  To make a poet black, and bid him sing!\n\n\n\n\n_A Song of Praise_\n\n(_For one who praised his lady\u2019s being fair._)\n\n\n  You have not heard my love\u2019s dark throat,\n    Slow-fluting like a reed,\n  Release the perfect golden note\n    She caged there for my need.\n\n  Her walk is like the replica\n    Of some barbaric dance\n  Wherein the soul of Africa\n    Is winged with arrogance.\n\n  And yet so light she steps across\n    The ways her sure feet pass,\n  She does not dent the smoothest moss\n    Or bend the thinnest grass.\n\n  My love is dark as yours is fair,\n    Yet lovelier I hold her\n  Than listless maids with pallid hair,\n    And blood that\u2019s thin and colder.\n\n  You-proud-and-to-be-pitied one,\n    Gaze on her and despair;\n  Then seal your lips until the sun\n    Discovers one as fair.\n\n\n\n\n_Brown Boy to Brown Girl_\n\n(_Remembrance on a hill_) (_For Yolande_)\n\n\n  \u201cAs surely as I hold your hand in mine,\n  As surely as your crinkled hair belies\n  The enamoured sun pretending that he dies\n  While still he loiters in its glossy shine,\n  As surely as I break the slender line\n  That spider linked us with, in no least wise\n  Am I uncertain that these alien skies\n  Do not our whole life measure and confine.\n  No less, once in a land of scarlet suns\n  And brooding winds, before the hurricane\n  Bore down upon us, long before this pain,\n  We found a place where quiet water runs;\n  I held your hand this way upon a hill,\n  And felt my heart forebear, my pulse grow still.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n_A Brown Girl Dead_\n\n\n  With two white roses on her breasts,\n    White candles at head and feet,\n  Dark Madonna of the grave she rests;\n    Lord Death has found her sweet.\n\n  Her mother pawned her wedding ring\n    To lay her out in white;\n  She\u2019d be so proud she\u2019d dance and sing\n    To see herself tonight.\n\n\n\n\n_To a Brown Girl_\n\n(_For Roberta_)\n\n\n  What if his glance is bold and free,\n    His mouth the lash of whips?\n  So should the eyes of lovers be,\n    And so a lover\u2019s lips.\n\n  What if no puritanic strain\n    Confines him to the nice?\n  He will not pass this way again,\n    Nor hunger for you twice.\n\n  Since in the end consort together\n    Magdalen and Mary,\n  Youth is the time for careless weather:\n    Later, lass, be wary.\n\n\n\n\n_To a Brown Boy_\n\n\n  That brown girl\u2019s swagger gives a twitch\n    To beauty like a queen;\n  Lad, never dam your body\u2019s itch\n    When loveliness is seen.\n\n  For there is ample room for bliss\n    In pride in clean, brown limbs,\n  And lips know better how to kiss\n    Than how to raise white hymns.\n\n  And when your body\u2019s death gives birth\n    To soil for spring to crown,\n  Men will not ask if that rare earth\n    Was white flesh once, or brown.\n\n\n\n\n_Black Magdalens_\n\n\n  These have no Christ to spit and stoop\n    To write upon the sand,\n  Inviting him that has not sinned\n    To raise the first rude hand.\n\n  And if he came they could not buy\n    Rich ointment for his feet,\n  The body\u2019s sale scarce yields enough\n   To let the body eat.\n\n  The chaste clean ladies pass them by\n   And draw their skirts aside,\n  But Magdalens have a ready laugh;\n    They wrap their wounds in pride.\n\n  They fare full ill since Christ forsook\n    The cross to mount a throne,\n  And Virtue still is stooping down\n    To cast the first hard stone.\n\n\n\n\n_Atlantic City Waiter_\n\n\n  With subtle poise he grips his tray\n    Of delicate things to eat;\n  Choice viands to their mouths half way,\n    The ladies watch his feet\n\n  Go carving dexterous avenues\n    Through sly intricacies;\n  Ten thousand years on jungle clues\n    Alone shaped feet like these.\n\n  For him to be humble who is proud\n    Needs colder artifice;\n  Though half his pride is disavowed,\n    In vain the sacrifice.\n\n  Sheer through his acquiescent mask\n    Of bland gentility,\n  The jungle flames like a copper cask\n    Set where the sun strikes free.\n\n\n\n\n_Near White_\n\n\n  Ambiguous of race they stand,\n    By one disowned, scorned of another,\n  Not knowing where to stretch a hand,\n    And cry, \u201cMy sister\u201d or \u201cMy brother.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n_Tableau_\n\n_For Donald Duff_\n\n\n  Locked arm in arm they cross the way,\n    The black boy and the white,\n  The golden splendor of the day,\n    The sable pride of night.\n\n  From lowered blinds the dark folk stare,\n    And here the fair folk talk,\n  Indignant that these two should dare\n    In unison to walk.\n\n  Oblivious to look and word\n    They pass, and see no wonder\n  That lightning brilliant as a sword\n    Should blaze the path of thunder.\n\n\n\n\n_Harlem Wine_\n\n\n  This is not water running here,\n    These thick rebellious streams\n  That hurtle flesh and bone past fear\n    Down alleyways of dreams.\n\n  This is a wine that must flow on\n    Not caring how nor where,\n  So it has ways to flow upon\n    Where song is in the air.\n\n  So it can woo an artful flute\n    With loose, elastic lips,\n  Its measurement of joy compute\n    With blithe, ecstatic hips.\n\n\n\n\n_Simon the Cyrenian Speaks_\n\n\n  He never spoke a word to me,\n    And yet He called my name;\n  He never gave a sign to me,\n    And yet I knew and came.\n\n  At first I said, \u201cI will not bear\n    His cross upon my back;\n  He only seeks to place it there\n    Because my skin is black.\u201d\n\n  But He was dying for a dream,\n    And He was very meek,\n  And in His eyes there shone a gleam\n    Men journey far to seek.\n\n  It was Himself my pity bought;\n    I did for Christ alone\n  What all of Rome could not have wrought\n    With bruise of lash or stone.\n\n\n\n\n_Incident_\n\n(_For Eric Walrond_)\n\n\n  Once riding in old Baltimore,\n    Heart-filled, head-filled with glee,\n  I saw a Baltimorean\n    Keep looking straight at me.\n\n  Now I was eight and very small,\n    And he was no whit bigger,\n  And so I smiled, but he poked out\n    His tongue, and called me, \u201cNigger.\u201d\n\n  I saw the whole of Baltimore\n    From May until December;\n  Of all the things that happened there\n    That\u2019s all that I remember.\n\n\n\n\n_Two Who Crossed a Line_\n\n(_She Crosses_)\n\n\n  From where she stood the air she craved\n    Smote with the smell of pine;\n  It was too much to bear; she braved\n    Her gods and crossed the line.\n\n  And we were hurt to see her go,\n    With her fair face and hair,\n  And veins too thin and blue to show\n    What mingled blood flowed there.\n\n  We envied her a while, who still\n    Pursued the hated track;\n  Then we forgot her name, until\n    One day her shade came back.\n\n  Calm as a wave without a crest,\n    Sorrow-proud and sorrow-wise,\n  With trouble sucking at her breast,\n    With tear-disdainful eyes,\n\n  She slipped into her ancient place,\n    And, no word asked, gave none;\n  Only the silence in her face\n    Said seats were dear in the sun.\n\n\n\n\n_Two Who Crossed a Line_\n\n(_He Crosses_)\n\n\n  He rode across like a cavalier,\n    Spurs clicking hard and loud;\n  And where he tarried dropped his tear\n    On heads he left low-bowed.\n\n  But, \u201cEven Stephen,\u201d he cried, and struck\n    His steed an urgent blow;\n  He swore by youth he was a buck\n    With savage oats to sow.\n\n  To even up some standing scores,\n    From every flower bed\n  He passed, he plucked by threes and fours\n    Till wheels whirled in his head.\n\n  But long before the drug could tell,\n    He took his anodyne;\n  With scornful grace, he bowed farewell\n    And retraversed the line.\n\n\n\n\n_Saturday\u2019s Child_\n\n\n  Some are teethed on a silver spoon,\n    With the stars strung for a rattle;\n  I cut my teeth as the black raccoon--\n    For implements of battle.\n\n  Some are swaddled in silk and down,\n    And heralded by a star;\n  They swathed my limbs in a sackcloth gown\n    On a night that was black as tar.\n\n  For some, godfather and goddame\n    The opulent fairies be;\n  Dame Poverty gave me my name,\n    And Pain godfathered me.\n\n  For I was born on Saturday--\n    \u201cBad time for planting a seed,\u201d\n  Was all my father had to say,\n    And, \u201cOne mouth more to feed.\u201d\n\n  Death cut the strings that gave me life,\n    And handed me to Sorrow,\n  The only kind of middle wife\n    My folks could beg or borrow.\n\n\n\n\n_The Dance of Love_\n\n(_After reading Ren\u00e9 Maran\u2019s \u201cBatouala\u201d_)\n\n\n  All night we danced upon our windy hill,\n  Your dress a cloud of tangled midnight hair,\n  And love was much too much for me to wear\n  My leaves; the killer roared above his kill,\n  But you danced on, and when some star would spill\n  Its red and white upon you whirling there,\n  I sensed a hidden beauty in the air;\n  Though you danced on, my heart and I stood still.\n\n  But suddenly a bit of morning crept\n  Along your trembling sides of ebony;\n  I saw the tears your tired limbs had wept,\n  And how your breasts heaved high, how languidly\n  Your dark arms moved; I drew you close to me;\n  We flung ourselves upon our hill and slept.\n\n\n\n\n_Pagan Prayer_\n\n\n  Not for myself I make this prayer,\n    But for this race of mine\n  That stretches forth from shadowed places\n    Dark hands for bread and wine.\n\n  For me, my heart is pagan mad,\n    My feet are never still,\n  But give them hearths to keep them warm\n    In homes high on a hill.\n\n  For me, my faith lies fallowing,\n    I bow not till I see,\n  But these are humble and believe;\n    Bless their credulity.\n\n  For me, I pay my debts in kind,\n    And see no better way,\n  Bless these who turn the other cheek\n    For love of you, and pray.\n\n  Our Father, God, our Brother, Christ--\n    So are we taught to pray;\n  Their kinship seems a little thing\n    Who sorrow all the day.\n\n  Our Father, God; our Brother, Christ,\n    Or are we bastard kin,\n  That to our plaints your ears are closed,\n    Your doors barred from within?\n\n  Our Father, God; our Brother, Christ,\n    Retrieve my race again;\n  So shall you compass this black sheep,\n    This pagan heart. Amen.\n\n\n\n\n_Wisdom Cometh With the Years_\n\n\n  Now I am young and credulous,\n    My heart is quick to bleed\n  At courage in the tremulous\n    Slow sprouting of a seed.\n\n  Now I am young and sensitive,\n    Man\u2019s lack can stab me through;\n  I own no stitch I would not give\n    To him that asked me to.\n\n  Now I am young and a fool for love,\n    My blood goes mad to see\n  A brown girl pass me like a dove\n    That flies melodiously.\n\n  Let me be lavish of my tears,\n    And dream that false is true;\n  Though wisdom cometh with the years,\n    The barren days come, too.\n\n\n\n\n_To My Fairer Brethren_\n\n\n  Though I score you with my best,\n    Treble circumstance\n  Must confirm the verdict, lest\n    It be laid to chance.\n\n  Insufficient that I match you\n    Every coin you flip;\n  Your demand is that I catch you\n    Squarely on the hip.\n\n  Should I wear my wreaths a bit\n    Rakishly and proud,\n  I have bought my right to it;\n    Let it be allowed.\n\n\n\n\n_Fruit of the Flower_\n\n\n  My father is a quiet man\n    With sober, steady ways;\n  For simile, a folded fan;\n    His nights are like his days.\n\n  My mother\u2019s life is puritan,\n    No hint of cavalier,\n  A pool so calm you\u2019re sure it can\n    Have little depth to fear.\n\n  And yet my father\u2019s eyes can boast\n    How full his life has been;\n  There haunts them yet the languid ghost\n    Of some still sacred sin.\n\n  And though my mother chants of God,\n    And of the mystic river,\n  I\u2019ve seen a bit of checkered sod\n    Set all her flesh aquiver.\n\n  Why should he deem it pure mischance\n    A son of his is fain\n  To do a naked tribal dance\n    Each time he hears the rain?\n\n  Why should she think it devil\u2019s art\n    That all my songs should be\n  Of love and lovers, broken heart,\n    And wild sweet agony?\n\n  Who plants a seed begets a bud,\n    Extract of that same root;\n  Why marvel at the hectic blood\n    That flushes this wild fruit?\n\n\n\n\n_The Shroud of Color_\n\n(_For Llewellyn Ransom_)\n\n\n  \u201cLord, being dark,\u201d I said, \u201cI cannot bear\n  The further touch of earth, the scented air;\n  Lord, being dark, forewilled to that despair\n  My color shrouds me in, I am as dirt\n  Beneath my brother\u2019s heel; there is a hurt\n  In all the simple joys which to a child\n  Are sweet; they are contaminate, defiled\n  By truths of wrongs the childish vision fails\n  To see; too great a cost this birth entails.\n  I strangle in this yoke drawn tighter than\n  The worth of bearing it, just to be man.\n  I am not brave enough to pay the price\n  In full; I lack the strength to sacrifice.\n  I who have burned my hands upon a star,\n  And climbed high hills at dawn to view the far\n  Illimitable wonderments of earth,\n  For whom all cups have dripped the wine of mirth,\n  For whom the sea has strained her honeyed throat\n  Till all the world was sea, and I a boat\n  Unmoored, on what strange quest I willed to float;\n  Who wore a many-colored coat of dreams,\n  Thy gift, O Lord--I whom sun-dabbled streams\n  Have washed, whose bare brown thighs have held the sun\n  Incarcerate until his course was run,\n  I who considered man a high-perfected\n  Glass where loveliness could lie reflected,\n  Now that I sway athwart Truth\u2019s deep abyss,\n  Denuding man for what he was and is,\n  Shall breath and being so inveigle me\n  That I can damn my dreams to hell, and be\n  Content, each new-born day, anew to see\n  The steaming crimson vintage of my youth\n  Incarnadine the altar-slab of Truth?\n\n  Or hast Thou, Lord, somewhere I cannot see,\n  A lamb imprisoned in a bush for me?\n\n  Not so? Then let me render one by one\n  Thy gifts, while still they shine; some little sun\n  Yet gilds these thighs; my coat, albeit worn,\n  Still holds its colors fast; albeit torn,\n  My heart will laugh a little yet, if I\n  May win of Thee this grace, Lord: on this high\n  And sacrificial hill \u2019twixt earth and sky,\n  To dream still pure all that I loved, and die.\n  There is no other way to keep secure\n  My wild chimeras; grave-locked against the lure\n  Of Truth, the small hard teeth of worms, yet less\n  Envenomed than the mouth of Truth, will bless\n  Them into dust and happy nothingness.\n  Lord, Thou art God; and I, Lord, what am I\n  But dust? With dust my place. Lord, let me die.\u201d\n\n  Across the earth\u2019s warm, palpitating crust\n  I flung my body in embrace; I thrust\n  My mouth into the grass and sucked the dew,\n  Then gave it back in tears my anguish drew;\n  So hard I pressed against the ground, I felt\n  The smallest sandgrain like a knife, and smelt\n  The next year\u2019s flowering; all this to speed\n  My body\u2019s dissolution, fain to feed\n  The worms. And so I groaned, and spent my strength\n  Until, all passion spent, I lay full length\n  And quivered like a flayed and bleeding thing.\n\n  So lay till lifted on a great black wing\n  That had no mate nor flesh-apparent trunk\n  To hamper it; with me all time had sunk\n  Into oblivion; when I awoke\n  The wing hung poised above two cliffs that broke\n  The bowels of the earth in twain, and cleft\n  The seas apart. Below, above, to left,\n  To right, I saw what no man saw before:\n  Earth, hell, and heaven; sinew, vein, and core.\n  All things that swim or walk or creep or fly,\n  All things that live and hunger, faint and die,\n  Were made majestic then and magnified\n  By sight so clearly purged and deified.\n  The smallest bug that crawls was taller than\n  A tree, the mustard seed loomed like a man.\n  The earth that writhes eternally with pain\n  Of birth, and woe of taking back her slain,\n  Laid bare her teeming bosom to my sight,\n  And all was struggle, gasping breath, and fight.\n  A blind worm here dug tunnels to the light,\n  And there a seed, racked with heroic pain,\n  Thrust eager tentacles to sun and rain;\n  It climbed; it died; the old love conquered me\n  To weep the blossom it would never be.\n  But here a bud won light; it burst and flowered\n  Into a rose whose beauty challenged, \u201cCoward!\u201d\n  There was no thing alive save only I\n  That held life in contempt and longed to die.\n  And still I writhed and moaned, \u201cThe curse, the curse,\n  Than animated death, can death be worse?\u201d\n\n  \u201c_Dark child of sorrow, mine no less, what art\n  Of mine can make thee see and play thy part?\n  The key to all strange things is in thy heart._\u201d\n\n  What voice was this that coursed like liquid fire\n  Along my flesh, and turned my hair to wire?\n\n  I raised my burning eyes, beheld a field\n  All multitudinous with carnal yield,\n  A grim ensanguined mead whereon I saw\n  Evolve the ancient fundamental law\n  Of tooth and talon, fist and nail and claw.\n  There with the force of living, hostile hills\n  Whose clash the hemmed-in vale with clamor fills,\n  With greater din contended fierce majestic wills\n  Of beast with beast, of man with man, in strife\n  For love of what my heart despised, for life\n  That unto me at dawn was now a prayer\n  For night, at night a bloody heart-wrung tear\n  For day again; for _this_, these groans\n  From tangled flesh and interlock\u00e8d bones.\n  And no thing died that did not give\n  A testimony that it longed to live.\n  Man, strange composite blend of brute and god,\n  Pushed on, nor backward glanced where last he trod.\n  He seemed to mount a misty ladder flung\n  Pendant from a cloud, yet never gained a rung\n  But at his feet another tugged and clung.\n  My heart was still a pool of bitterness,\n  Would yield nought else, nought else confess.\n  I spoke (although no form was there\n  To see, I knew an ear was there to hear),\n  \u201cWell, let them fight; they _can_ whose flesh is fair.\u201d\n\n  Crisp lightning flashed; a wave of thunder shook\n  My wing; a pause, and then a speaking, \u201cLook.\u201d\n\n  I scarce dared trust my ears or eyes for awe\n  Of what they heard, and dread of what they saw;\n  For, privileged beyond degree, this flesh\n  Beheld God and His heaven in the mesh\n  Of Lucifer\u2019s revolt, saw Lucifer\n  Glow like the sun, and like a dulcimer\n  I heard his sin-sweet voice break on the yell\n  Of God\u2019s great warriors: Gabriel,\n  Saint Clair and Michael, Israfel and Raphael.\n  And strange it was to see God with His back\n  Against a wall, to see Christ hew and hack\n  Till Lucifer, pressed by the mighty pair,\n  And losing inch by inch, clawed at the air\n  With fevered wings; then, lost beyond repair,\n  He tricked a mass of stars into his hair;\n  He filled his hands with stars, crying as he fell,\n  \u201cA star\u2019s a star although it burns in hell.\u201d\n  So God was left to His divinity,\n  Omnipotent at that most costly fee.\n\n  There was a lesson here, but still the clod\n  In me was sycophant unto the rod,\n  And cried, \u201cWhy mock me thus? Am I a god?\u201d\n\n  \u201c_One trial more: this failing, then I give\n  You leave to die; no further need to live._\u201d\n\n  Now suddenly a strange wild music smote\n  A chord long impotent in me; a note\n  Of jungles, primitive and subtle, throbbed\n  Against my echoing breast, and tom-toms sobbed\n  In every pulse-beat of my frame. The din\n  A hollow log bound with a python\u2019s skin\n  Can make wrought every nerve to ecstasy,\n  And I was wind and sky again, and sea,\n  And all sweet things that flourish, being free.\n\n  Till all at once the music changed its key.\n\n  And now it was of bitterness and death,\n  The cry the lash extorts, the broken breath\n  Of liberty enchained; and yet there ran\n  Through all a harmony of faith in man,\n  A knowledge all would end as it began.\n  All sights and sounds and aspects of my race\n  Accompanied this melody, kept pace\n  With it; with music all their hopes and hates\n  Were charged, not to be downed by all the fates.\n  And somehow it was borne upon my brain\n  How being dark, and living through the pain\n  Of it, is courage more than angels have.

understand, because they fell\n    From that all-perfect place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n_Judas Iscariot_\n\n\n  I think when Judas\u2019 mother heard\n    His first faint cry the night\n  That he was born, that worship stirred\n    Her at the sound and sight.\n  She thought his was as fair a frame\n    As flesh and blood had worn;\n  I think she made this lovely name\n    For him--\u201cStar of my morn.\u201d\n\n  As any mother\u2019s son he grew\n    From spring to crimson spring;\n  I think his eyes were black, or blue,\n    His hair curled like a ring.\n  His mother\u2019s heart-strings were a lute\n    Whereon he all day played;\n  She listened rapt, abandoned, mute,\n    To every note he made.\n\n  I think he knew the growing Christ,\n    And played with Mary\u2019s son,\n  And where mere mortal craft sufficed,\n    There Judas may have won.\n  Perhaps he little cared or knew,\n    So folly-wise is youth,\n  That He whose hand his hand clung to\n    Was flesh-embodied Truth;\n\n  Until one day he heard young Christ,\n    With far-off eyes agleam,\n  Tell of a mystic, solemn tryst\n    Between Him and a dream.\n  And Judas listened, wonder-eyed,\n    Until the Christ was through,\n  Then said, \u201cAnd I, though good betide,\n    Or ill, will go with you.\u201d\n\n  And so he followed, heard Christ preach,\n    Saw how by miracle\n  The blind man saw, the dumb got speech,\n    The leper found him well.\n  And Judas in those holy hours\n    Loved Christ, and loved Him much,\n  And in his heart he sensed dead flowers\n    Bloom at the Master\u2019s touch.\n\n  And when Christ felt the death hour creep\n    With sullen, drunken lurch,\n  He said to Peter, \u201cFeed my sheep,\n    And build my holy church.\u201d\n  He gave to each the special task\n    That should be his to do,\n  But reaching one, I hear him ask,\n    \u201cWhat shall I give to you?\u201d\n\n  Then Judas in his hot desire\n    Said, \u201cGive me what you will.\u201d\n  Christ spoke to him with words of fire,\n    \u201cThen, Judas, you must kill\n  One whom you love, One who loves you\n    As only God\u2019s son can:\n  This is the work for you to do\n    To save the creature man.\u201d\n\n  \u201cAnd men to come will curse your name,\n    And hold you up to scorn;\n  In all the world will be no shame\n    Like yours; this is love\u2019s thorn.\n  It takes strong will of heart and soul,\n    But man is under ban.\n  Think, Judas, can you play this role\n    In heaven\u2019s mystic plan?\u201d\n\n  So Judas took the sorry part,\n    Went out and spoke the word,\n  And gave the kiss that broke his heart,\n    But no one knew or heard.\n  And no one knew what poison ate\n    Into his palm that day,\n  Where, bright and damned, the monstrous weight\n    Of thirty white coins lay.\n\n  It was not death that Judas found\n    Upon a kindly tree;\n  The man was dead long ere he bound\n    His throat as final fee.\n  And who can say if on that day\n    When gates of pearl swung wide,\n  Christ did not go His honored way\n    With Judas by His side?\n\n  I think somewhere a table round\n    Owns Jesus as its head,\n  And there the saintly twelve are found\n    Who followed where He led.\n  And Judas sits down with the rest,\n    And none shrinks from His hand,\n  For there the worst is as the best,\n    And there they understand.\n\n  And you may think of Judas, friend,\n    As one who broke his word,\n  Whose neck came to a bitter end\n    For giving up his Lord.\n  But I would rather think of him\n    As the little Jewish lad\n  Who gave young Christ heart, soul, and limb,\n    And all the love he had.\n\n\n\n\n_The Wise_\n\n(_For Alain Locke_)\n\n\n  Dead men are wisest, for they know\n  How far the roots of flowers go,\n  How long a seed must rot to grow.\n\n  Dead men alone bear frost and rain\n  On throbless heart and heatless brain,\n  And feel no stir of joy or pain.\n\n  Dead men alone are satiate;\n  They sleep and dream and have no weight,\n  To curb their rest, of love or hate.\n\n  Strange, men should flee their company,\n  Or think me strange who long to be\n  Wrapped in their cool immunity.\n\n\n\n\n_Mary, Mother of

is surfeited,\n        And when the last low note is read,\n        He sings among the lipless dead\n        With singing stars to crown his head.\n\n  Body: But will song buy a wooden box\n        The length of me from toe to crown,\n        To keep me safe from carrion flocks\n        When singing\u2019s done and lyre laid down?\n\n\n\n\n_In Memory of Col.

Spring beats\n  Her tocsin call to those who love her,\n  And lo! the dogwood petals cover\n\n  Her breast with drifts of snow, and sleek\n  White gulls fly screaming to her, and hover\n  About her shoulders, and kiss her cheek,\n  While white and purple lilacs muster\n  A strength that bears them to a cluster\n  Of color and odor; for her sake\n  All things that slept are now awake.\n\n  And you and I, shall we lie still,\n  John Keats, while Beauty summons us?\n  Somehow I feel your sensitive will\n  Is pulsing up some tremulous\n  Sap road of a maple tree, whose leaves\n  Grow music as they grow, since your\n  Wild voice is in them, a harp that grieves\n  For life that opens death\u2019s dark door.\n  Though dust, your fingers still can push\n  The Vision Splendid to a birth,\n  Though now they work as grass in the hush\n  Of the night on the broad sweet page of the earth.\n\n  \u201cJohn Keats is dead,\u201d they say, but I\n  Who hear your full insistent cry\n  In bud and blossom, leaf and tree,\n  Know John Keats still writes poetry.\n  And while my head is earthward bowed\n  To read new life sprung from your shroud,\n  Folks seeing me must think it strange\n  That merely spring should so derange\n  My mind. They do not know that you,\n  John Keats, keep revel with me, too.\n\n  [A] Spring, 1924\n\n\n\n\n_On Going_\n\n(_For Willard Johnson_)\n\n\n  A grave is all too weak a thing\n    To hold my fancy long;\n  I\u2019ll bear a blossom with the spring,\n    Or be a blackbird\u2019s song,\n\n  I think that I shall fade with ease,\n    Melt into earth like snow,\n  Be food for hungry, growing trees,\n    Or help the lilies blow.\n\n  And if my love should lonely walk,\n    Quite of my nearness fain,\n  I may come back to her, and talk\n    In liquid words of rain.\n\n\n\n\n_Harsh World That Lashest Me_\n\n(_For Walter White_)\n\n\n  Harsh World that lashest me each day,\n    Dub me not cowardly because\n  I seem to find no sudden way\n    To throttle you or clip your claws.\n  No force compels me to the wound\n    Whereof my body bears the scar;\n  Although my feet are on the ground,\n    Doubt not my eyes are on a star.\n\n  You cannot keep me captive, World,\n    Entrammeled, chained, spit on, and spurned.\n  More free than all your flags unfurled,\n    I give my body to be burned.\n  I mount my cross because I will,\n    I drink the hemlock which you give\n  For wine which you withhold--and still,\n    Because I will not die, I live.\n\n  I live because an ember in\n    Me smoulders to regain its fire,\n  Because what is and what has been\n    Not yet have conquered my desire.\n  I live to prove the groping clod\n    Is surely more than simple dust;\n  I live to see the breath of God\n    Beatify the carnal crust.\n\n  But when I will, World, I can go,\n    Though triple bronze should wall me round,\n  Slip past your guard as swift as snow,\n    Translated without pain or sound.\n  Within myself is lodged the key\n    To that vast room of couches laid\n  For those too proud to live and see\n    Their dreams of light eclipsed in shade.\n\n\n\n\n_Requiescam_\n\n\n  _I am for sleeping and forgetting\n    All that has gone before;\n  I am for lying still and letting\n    Who will beat at my door;\n  I would my life\u2019s cold sun were setting\n    To rise for me no more._\n\n\n\n\n  Italicized text is surrounded by underscores: _italics_.\n\n  An incorrect page number in the Table of Contents has been corrected.",
