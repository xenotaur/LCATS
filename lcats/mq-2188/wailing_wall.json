    "body": "_Numb with the terror that had dogged him from the moment he regained\nconsciousness and found himself naked and weaponless, Farrell had no\nidea how long he had been lost in the honeycombed darkness of the\nHymenop dome._\n\n_The darkness and damp chill of air told him that he was far\nunderground, possibly at the hive's lowest level. Somewhere above\nhim, the silent audience chambers lay shrouded in lesser gloom, heavy\nwith the dust of generations and peopled only by cryptic apian images.\nOutside the dome, in a bend of lazy silver river, sprawled the Sadr III\nvillage with its stoic handful of once-normal Terran colonists and, on\nthe hillside above the village, Gibson and Stryker and Xavier would be\nwaiting for him in the disabled_ Marco Four.\n\n_Waiting for him...._\n\n_They might as well have been back on Terra, five hundred light-years\naway._\n\n_Six feet away on either side, the corridor walls curved up faintly, a\nflattened oval of tunneling designed for multiple alien feet, lighted\nfor faceted eyes demanding the merest fraction of light necessary\nfor an Earthman's vision. For two yards Farrell could see dimly, as\nthrough a heavy fog; beyond was nothing but darkness and an outlandish\nlabyrinth of cross-branching corridors that spiraled on forever without\nend._\n\n_Behind him, his pursuers--human natives or Hymenop invaders, he had\nno way of knowing which--drew nearer with a dry minor rustling whose\nsuggestion of imminent danger sent Farrell plunging blindly on into the\nmaze._\n\n_--To halt, sweating, when a sound exactly similar came to him from\nahead._\n\n_It was what he had feared from the beginning. He could not go on, and\nhe could not go back._\n\n_He made out the intersecting corridor to his right, then a vague oval\nopening that loomed faintly grayer than the wall about it. He darted\ninto it as into a sanctuary, and realized too late that the choice had\nbeen forced upon him._\n\n_It had been intended from the start that he should take this way. He\nhad been herded here like a halterless beast, driven by the steady\nthreat of action never quite realized._ They _had known where he was\ngoing, and why._\n\n_But there was light down there somewhere at the end of the tunnel's\naimless wanderings. If, once there, he could see--_\n\n_He did not find light, only a lesser darkness. The tunnel led him\ninto a larger place whose outer reaches were lost in shadow, but whose\ncentral area held a massive cylindrical machine at once alien and\nfamiliar._\n\n_He went toward it hesitantly, confused for the moment by a paramnesiac\nsense of repeated experience, the specious recognition of_ d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n\n_It was a Ringwave generator, and it was the thing he had ventured into\nthe dome to find._\n\n_His confusion stemmed from its resemblance to the disabled generator\naboard the_ Marco Four, _and from the stereo-sharp associations it\nevoked: Gibson working over the ship's power plant, his black-browed\nface scowling and intent, square brown body moving with a wrestler's\neasy economy of motion; Stryker, bald and fat and worried, wheezing up\nand down the companionway from engine bay to chart room, his concern\ndivided between Gibson's task and Farrell's long silence in the dome._\n\n_Stryker at this moment would be regretting the congenital optimism\nthat had prompted him to send his navigator where he himself could\nnot go. Sweating anxiety would have replaced Stryker's pontifical\nassurance, dried up his smug pattering of socio-psychological truisms\nlifted from the Colonial Reclamations Handbook...._\n\n\n\n\"So far as adaptability is concerned,\" Stryker had said an eternal\nevening before, \"_homo sapiens_ can be a pretty weird species. More\ngiven to mulish paradox, perhaps, than any alien life-form we're ever\nlikely to run across out here.\"\n\nHe had shifted his bulk comfortably on the grass under the _Marco\nFour's_ open port, undisturbed by the busy clatter of tools inside the\nship where Gibson and Xavier, the _Marco's_ mechanical, worked over\nthe disabled power plant. He laced his fingers across his fat paunch\nand peered placidly through the dusk at Farrell, who lay on his back,\nsmoking and watching the stars grow bright in the evening sky.\n\n\"Isolate a human colony from its parent planet for two centuries,\nenslave it for half that time to a hegemony as foreign as the\nHymenops' hive-culture before abandoning it to its own devices, and\nanything at all in the way of eccentric social controls can develop.\nBut men remain basically identical, Arthur, in spite of acquired\nsuperficial changes. They are inherently incapable of evolving any\nsystem of control mechanisms that cannot be understood by other men,\nprovided the environmental circumstances that brought that system into\nbeing are known. At bottom, these Sadr III natives are no different\nfrom ourselves. Heredity won't permit it.\"\n\nFarrell, half listening, had been staring upward between the icy white\nbrilliance of Deneb and the twin blue-and-yellow jewels of Albireo,\nsearching for a remote twinkle of Sol. Five hundred light-years away\nout there, he was thinking, lay Earth. And from Earth all this gaudy\nalien glory was no more than another point of reference for backyard\nastronomers, a minor configuration casually familiar and unremarkable.\n\nA winking of lighted windows springing up in the village downslope\nbrought his attention back to the scattered cottages by the river, and\nto the great disquieting curve of the Hymenop dome that rose above them\nlike a giant above pygmies. He sat up restlessly, the wind ruffling\nhis hair and whirling the smoke of his cigarette away in thin flying\nspirals.\n\n\"You sound as smug as the Reorientation chapter you lifted that bit\nfrom,\" Farrell said. \"But it won't apply here, Lee. The same thing\nhappened to these people that happened to the other colonists we've\nfound, but they don't react the same. Either those Hymenop devils\nwarped them permanently or they're a tribe of congenital maniacs.\"\n\nStryker prodded him socratically: \"Particulars?\"\n\n\"When we crashed here five weeks ago, there were an even thousand\nnatives in the village, plus or minus a few babes in arms. Since\nthat time they've lost a hundred twenty-six members, all suicides or\nmurders. At first the entire population turned out at sunrise and went\ninto the dome for an hour before going to the fields; since we came,\nthat period has shortened progressively to a few minutes. That much\nwe've learned by observation. By direct traffic we've learned exactly\nnothing except that they can speak Terran Standard, but won't. What\nsort of system is that?\"\n\nStryker tugged uncomfortably at the rim of white hair the years had\nleft him. \"It's a stumper for the moment, I'll admit ... if they'd\nonly _talk_ to us, if they'd tell us what their wants and fears and\nproblems are, we'd know what is wrong and what to do about it. But\ncontrols forced on them by the Hymenops, or acquired since their\nliberation, seem to have altered their original ideology so radically\nthat--\"\n\n\"That they're plain batty,\" Farrell finished for him. \"The whole setup\nis unnatural, Lee. Consider this: We sent Xavier out to meet the first\nnative that showed up, and the native talked to him. We heard it all by\nmonitoring; his name was Tarvil, he spoke Terran Standard, and he was\namicable. Then we showed ourselves, and when he saw that we were human\nbeings like himself and not mechanicals like Xav, he clammed up. So did\neveryone in the village. It worries me, Lee. If they didn't expect men\nto come out of the _Marco_, then what in God's name _did_ they expect?\"\n\nHe sat up restlessly and stubbed out his cigarette. \"It's an\nunimportant world anyway, all ocean except for this one small\ncontinent. I think we ought to write it off and get the hell out as\nsoon as the _Marco_'s Ringwave is repaired.\"\n\n\"We can't write it off,\" Stryker said. \"Besides reclaiming a colony, we\nmay have added a valuable marine food source to the Federation. Arthur,\nyou're not letting a handful of disoriented people get under your\nskin, are you?\"\n\nFarrell made an impatient sound and lit another cigarette. The brief\nflare of his lighter pierced the darkness and picked out a hurried\nmovement a short stone's throw away, between the _Marco Four_ and the\nvillage.\n\n\n\n\"There's one reason why I'm edgy,\" Farrell said. \"These Sadrians may\nbe harmless, but they make a point of posting a guard over us. There's\na sentry out there in the grass flats again tonight.\" He turned on\nStryker uneasily. \"I've watched on the infra-scanner while those\nsentries changed shifts, and they don't speak to each other. I've\ntracked them back to the village, but I've never seen one of them turn\nin a--\"\n\nDown in the village a man screamed, a raw, tortured sound that brought\nboth men up stiffly. A frantic drumming of running feet came to them,\nunmistakable across the little distance. The fleeing man came up from\nthe dark huddle of cottages by the river and out across the grass\nflats, screaming.\n\nPursuit overtook him halfway to the ship. There was a brief scuffling,\na shadowy dispersal of silent figures. After that, nothing.\n\n\"They did it again,\" Farrell said. \"One of them tried to come up here\nto us. The others killed him, and who's to say what sort of twisted\nmotive prompted them? They go to the dome together every morning, not\nspeaking. They work all day in the fields without so much as looking at\neach other. But every night at least one of them tries to escape from\nthe village and come up here--and this is what happens. We couldn't\ntrust them, Lee, even if we could understand them!\"\n\n\"It's our job to understand them,\" Stryker said doggedly. \"Our function\nis to find colonies disoriented by the Hymenops and to set them\nstraight if we can. If we can't, we call in a long-term reorientation\ncrew, and within three generations the culture will pass again for\nTerran. The fact that slave colonies invariably lose their knowledge of\nlongevity helps; they don't get it back until they're ready for it.\n\n\"I've seen some pretty foul results of Hymenop experimenting\non human colonies, Arthur. There was the ninth planet of Beta\nPegasi--rediscovered in 3910, I think it was--that developed a\nreligious fixation on fertility, a mania fostered by the Hymenops to\nsupply expendable labor for their mines. The natives stopped mining\nwhen the Hymenops gave up the invasion and went back to 70 Ophiuchi,\nbut they were still multiplying like rabbits when we found them. They\nfollowed a cultural conviction something like that observed in Oriental\nraces of ancient Terran history, but they didn't pursue the Oriental\ntradition of sacrosancts. They couldn't--there were too many of them.\nBy the time they were found, they numbered fourteen _billions_ and they\nwere eating each other. Still it took only three generations to set\nthem straight.\"\n\nHe took one of Farrell's cigarettes and puffed it placidly.\n\n\"For that matter, Earth had her own share of eccentric cultures. I\nrecall reading about one that existed as late as the twentieth century\nand equaled anything we're likely to find here. Any society should be\ngeared to a set of social controls designed to furnish it, as a whole\nwith a maximum of pleasure and a minimum of discomfort, but these\nancient Terrestrial Dobuans--island aborigines, as I remember it--had\nadjusted to their total environment in a manner exactly opposite. They\nreversed the norm and became a society of paranoiacs, hating each\nother in direct ratio to nearness of relationship. Husbands and wives\ndetested each other, sons and fathers--\"\n\n\"Now you're pulling my leg,\" Farrell protested. \"A society like that\nwould be too irrational to function.\"\n\n\"But the system worked,\" Stryker insisted. \"It balanced well enough, as\nlong as they were isolated. They accepted it because it was all they\nknew, and an abrupt reversal that negated their accustomed habits would\ncreate an impossible societal conflict. They were reoriented after\nthe Fourth War, and succeeding generations adjusted to normal living\nwithout difficulty.\"\n\nA sound from overhead made them look up. Gibson was standing in the\n_Marco's_ open port.\n\n\"Conference,\" Gibson said in his heavy baritone, and went back inside.\n\n\n\nThey followed Gibson quickly and without question, more disturbed by\nthe terse order than by the killing in the grass flats. Knowing Gibson,\nthey realized that he would not have wasted even that one word unless\nemergency justified it.\n\nThey found him waiting in the chart room with Xavier. For the\nthousandth time, seeing the two together, Farrell found himself\ncomparing them: the robot, smoothly functional from flexible gray\nplastoid body to featureless oval faceplate, blandly efficient, totally\nincapable of emotion; Gibson, short and dark and competent heavy-browed\nand humorless. Except for initiative, Farrell thought, the two of them\ncould have traded identities and no one would have been able to notice\nany difference.\n\n\"Xav and I found our Ringwave trouble,\" Gibson said. \"The generator is\nfunctioning, but the warp isn't going out. Something here on Sadr III\nis neutralizing it.\"\n\nThey stared at him as if he had just told them the planet was flat.\n\n\"But a Ringwave can't be stopped completely, once it is started,\"\nStryker protested. \"You'd have to dismantle it to shut it off, Gib!\"\n\n\"The warping field can be damped out, though,\" Gibson said. \"Adjacent\ngenerators operating at different phase levels will heterodyne at a\nfrequency representing the mean variance between levels. The resulting\nbeat-phase will be too low to maintain either field, and one or the\nother, or both, will blank out. If you remember, all Terran-designed\npower plants are set to the same phase for that reason.\"\n\n\"But these natives _can't_ have a Ringwave plant!\" Farrell argued.\n\"There's only this one village on Sadr III, Gib, an insignificant\nlittle agrarian township! If they had the Ringwave, they'd be\nmechanized. They'd have vehicles, landing ports....\"\n\n\"The Hymenops had the Ringwave,\" Gibson interrupted. \"And they left the\ndome down there, the first undamaged one we've found. Figure it out for\nyourselves.\"\n\nThey digested the statement in silence. Stryker paled slowly, as if\nit needed time for apprehension to work its way through his fat bulk.\nFarrell's uneasiness, sourceless until now, grew to chill certainty.\n\n\n\n\"I think I've expected this, without realizing it, since my first\nflight,\" he said. \"It stood to reason that the Hymenops would quit\nrunning somewhere, that we'd bump into them eventually out here on the\nfringes. Twenty thousand light-years back to 70 Ophiuchi is a long way\nto retreat.... Gib, do you think they're still here?\"\n\nGibson did not shrug, but his voice seemed to. \"It won't matter one way\nor the other unless we can clear the _Marco's_ generator.\"\n\nFrom another man it might have been irony. Knowing Gibson, Farrell and\nStryker accepted it as a bald statement of fact.\n\n\"Then we're up against a Hymenop hive-mind,\" Stryker said. \"And we\ncan't run away from it. Any suggestions?\"\n\n\"We'll have to find the interfering generator and stop it,\" Farrell\noffered, knowing that was the only obvious solution.\n\n\"One alternative,\" Gibson corrected. \"If we can determine what\nphase-level the interfering warp uses, we may be able to adjust the\n_Marco's_ generator to match it. Once they're in resonance, they won't\ninterfere.\" He caught Stryker's unspoken question and answered it. \"It\nwould take a week. Maybe longer.\"\n\nStryker vetoed the alternative. \"Too long. If there are Hymenops here,\nthey won't give us that much time.\"\n\nFarrell switched on the chart room scanning screen and centered it\non the village downslope. Scattered cottages with dark tiled roofs\nand lamp-bright windows showed up clearly. Out of their undisciplined\ngrouping swept the great hemispherical curve of the dome, glinting\ndully metallic in the starshine.\n\n\"Maybe we're jumping to conclusions,\" he said. \"We've been here for\nfive weeks without seeing a trace of Hymenops, and from what I've read\nof them, they'd have jumped us the minute we landed. Chances are that\nthey left Sadr III in too great a hurry to wreck the dome, and their\nRingwave power plant is still running.\"\n\n\"You may be right,\" Stryker said, brightening. \"They carried the fight\nto us from the first skirmish, two hundred years ago, and they damned\nnear beat us before we learned how to fight them.\"\n\nHe looked at Xavier's silent plastoid figure with something like\naffection. \"We'd have lost that war without Xave's kind. We\ncouldn't match wits with Hymenop hive-minds, any more than a swarm\nof grasshoppers could stand up to a colony of wasps. But we made\nmechanicals that could. Cybernetic brains and servo-crews, ships that\nthought for themselves....\"\n\nHe squinted at the visiscreen with its cryptic, star-streaked dome.\n\"But they don't think as we do. They may have left a rear guard here,\nor they may have boobytrapped the dome.\"\n\n\"One of us will have to find out which it is,\" Farrell said. He took\na restless turn about the chart room, weighing the probabilities. \"It\nseems to fall in my department.\"\n\nStryker stared. \"You? Why?\"\n\n\"Because I'm the only one who _can_ go. Remember what Gib said about\nchanging the _Marco's_ Ringwave to resonate with the interfering\ngenerator? Gib can make the change; I can't. You're--\"\n\n\"Too old and fat,\" Stryker finished for him. \"And too damned slow and\ngarrulous. You're right, of course.\"\n\nThey let it go at that and put Xavier on guard for the night. The\nmechanical was infinitely more alert and sensitive to approach than any\nof the crew, but the knowledge did not make Farrell's sleep the sounder.\n\nHe dozed fitfully, waking a dozen times during the night to smoke\ncigarettes and to speculate fruitlessly on what he might find in the\ndome. He was sweating out a nightmare made hideous by monstrous bees\nthat threatened him in buzzing alien voices when Xavier's polite\nmonotone woke him for breakfast.\n\n\n\nFarrell was halfway down the grassy slope to the village when he\nrealized that the _Marco_ was still under watch. Approaching close\nenough for recognition, he saw that the sentry this time was Tarvil,\nthe Sadrian who had first approached the ship. The native's glance took\nin Farrell's shoulder-pack of testing tools and audiphone, brushed the\nhand-torch and blast gun at the Terran's belt, and slid away without\ntrace of expression.\n\n\"I'm going into the dome,\" Farrell said. He tried to keep the\nuncertainty out of his voice, and felt a rasp of irritation when he\nfailed. \"Is there a taboo against that?\"\n\nThe native fell in beside him without speaking and they went down\ntogether, walking a careful ten feet apart, through dew-drenched grass\nflats that gleamed like fields of diamonds under the early morning sun.\nFrom the village, as they approached, straggled the inevitable exodus\nof adults and half-grown children, moving silently out to the fields.\n\n\"Weird beggars,\" Farrell said into his audiphone button. \"They don't\neven rub elbows at work. You'd think they were afraid of being\ncontaminated.\"\n\nStryker's voice came tinnily in his ear. \"They won't seem so strange\nonce we learn their motivations. I'm beginning to think this\naloofness of theirs is a religious concomitant, Arthur, a hangover\nfrom slave-controls designed to prevent rebellion through isolation.\nConsidering what they must have suffered under the Hymenops, it's a\nwonder they're even sane.\"\n\n\"I'll grant the religious origin,\" Farrell said. \"But I wouldn't risk a\ncenticredit on their sanity. I think the lot of them are nuts.\"\n\nThe village was not deserted, but so far as Farrell's coming was\nconcerned, it might as well have been. The few women and children he\nsaw on the streets ignored him--and Tarvil--completely.\n\nHe met with only one sign of interest, when a naked boy perhaps six\nyears old stared curiously and asked something in a childish treble of\nthe woman accompanying him. The woman answered with a single sharp\nword and struck the child across the face, sending him sprawling.\n\nFarrell relayed the incident. \"She said '_Quiet!_' and slapped him\ndown, Lee. They start their training early.\"\n\n\"Their sort of indifference couldn't be congenital,\" Stryker said. His\ntinny murmur took on a puzzled sound. \"But they've been free for four\ngenerations. It's hard to believe that any forcibly implanted control\nmechanism could remain in effect so long.\"\n\nA shadow blocked the sun, bringing a faint chill to Farrell when he\nlooked up to see the great rounded hump of the dome looming over him.\n\n\"I'm going into the dome now,\" he said. \"It's like all the others--no\nopenings except at ground level, where it's riddled with them.\"\n\nTarvil did not accompany him inside. Farrell, looking back as he\nthumbed his hand-torch alight in the nearest entranceway, saw the\nnative squatting on his heels and looking after him without a single\ntrace of interest.\n\n\n\n\"I'm at ground level,\" Farrell said later, \"in what seems to have\nbeen a storage section. Empty now, with dust everywhere except in the\ncorridors the natives use when they come in, mornings. No sign of\nHymenops yet.\"\n\nStryker's voice turned worried. \"Look sharp for traps, Arthur. The\nplace may be mined.\"\n\nThe upper part of the dome, Farrell knew from previous experience,\nwould have been given over in years past to Hymenop occupation, layer\nafter rising layer of dormitories tiered like honeycombs to conserve\nspace. He followed a spiral ramp downward to the level immediately\nbelow surface, and felt his first excitement of discovery when he found\nhimself in the audience chambers that, until the _Marco's_ coming, had\nbeen the daily goal of the Sadrian natives.\n\nThe level was entirely taken up with bare ten-foot cubicles, each\ncramped chamber dominated by a cryptic metal-and-crystal likeness\nof the Hymenop head set into the metal wall opposite its corridor\nentrance. From either side of a circular speaking-grill, the antennae\nprojected into the room, rasplike and alert, above faceted crystal\neyes that glowed faintly in the near-darkness. The craftsmanship was\nfaultless, stylized after a fashion alien to Farrell's imagining and\npersonifying with disturbing realism the soulless, arrogant efficiency\nof the Hymenop hive-mind. To Farrell, there was about each image a\nbrooding air of hypnotic fixity.\n\n\"Something new in Hymenop experiments,\" he reported to Stryker. \"None\nof the other domes we found had anything like this. These things have\nsome bearing on the condition of the natives, Lee--there's a path worn\nthrough the dust to every image, and I can see where the people knelt.\nI don't like it. I've got a hunch that whatever these damned idols were\nused for succeeded too well.\"\n\n\"They can't be idols,\" Stryker said. \"The Hymenops would have known how\nhard it is to displace anthropomorphism entirely from human worship.\nBut I think you're right about the experiment's working too well. No\nordinary compulsion would have stuck so long. Periodic hypnosis? Wait,\nArthur, that's an angle I want to check with Gibson....\"\n\nHe was back a moment later, wheezing with excitement.\n\n\"Gib thinks I'm on the right track--periodic hypnosis. The Hymenops\nmust have assigned a particular chamber and image to each slave. The\nimages are mechanicals, robot mesmerists designed to keep the natives'\ncompulsion-to-isolation renewed. Post-hypnotic suggestion kept the\npoor devils coming back every morning, and their children with them,\neven after the Hymenops pulled out. They couldn't break away until\nthe _Marco's_ Ringwave forced a shutdown of the dome's power plant\nand deactivated the images. Not that they're any better off now that\nthey're free; they don't know how--\"\n\nFarrell never heard the rest of it. Something struck him sharply across\nthe back of the head.\n\n\n\nWhen he regained consciousness, he was naked and weaponless and lost.\nThe rustling of approach, bodiless and dreadful in darkness, panicked\nhim completely and sent him fleeing through a sweating eternity that\nbrought him finally to the dome's lowest level and the Hymenop power\nplant.\n\nHe went hesitantly toward the shadowy bulk of the Ringwave cylinder,\ndrawn as much now by its familiarity as driven by the terror behind\nhim. At the base of the towering machine, he made out a control board\ntotally unrecognizable in design, studded with dials and switches\nclearly intended for alien handling.\n\nThe tinny whispering of Stryker's voice in the vaultlike quiet struck\nhim with the frightening feeling that he had gone mad.\n\nHe saw his equipment pack then, lying undamaged at the foot of the\ncontrol board. Stryker's voice murmured from its audicom unit: \"We're\nin the dome, Arthur. Where are you? What level--\"\n\nFarrell caught up the audicom, swept by a sudden wild lift of hope.\n\"I'm at the bottom of the dome, in the Ringwave chamber. They took my\ngun and torch. For God's sake, hurry!\"\n\nThe darkness gave up a furtive scuffling of sandaled feet, the tight\nbreathing of many men. Someone made a whimpering sound, doglike and\npiteous; a Sadrian voice hissed sharply, \"_Quiet!_\"\n\nStryker's metallic whisper said: \"We're tracking your carrier, Arthur.\nUse the tools they left you. They brought you there to repair the\nRingwave, to give back the power that kept their images going. Keep\nbusy!\"\n\nFarrell, only half understanding, took up his instrument case. His\nmovement triggered a tense rustle in the darkness; the voice whimpered\nagain, a tortured sound that rasped Farrell's nerves like a file on\nglass.\n\n\"_Give me back my Voice. I am alone and afraid. I must have\nCounsel...._\"\n\nBeneath the crying, Farrell felt the terror, incredibly voiced, that\nweighted the darkness, the horror implicit in stilled breathing, the\nswelling sense of outrage.\n\nThere was a soft rush of bodies, a panting and struggling. The\nwhimpering stopped.\n\nThe instrument case slipped out of Farrell's hands. On the heels of its\nnerve-shattering crash against the metal floor came Stryker's voice,\nstronger as it came closer.\n\n\"Steady, Arthur. They'll kill you if you make a scene. We're coming,\nGib and Xav and I. Don't lose your head!\"\n\nFarrell crouched back against the cold curve of the Ringwave cylinder,\nstraining against flight with an effort that left him trembling\nuncontrollably. A spasm of incipient screaming seized his throat and\nhe bit it back savagely, stifling a terror that could not be seen,\ngrasped, fought with.\n\nHe was giving way slowly when Xavier's inflectionless voice droned out\nof the darkness: \"Quiet. Your Counsel will be restored.\"\n\nThere was a sudden flood of light, unbearable after long darkness.\nFarrell had a failing glimpse of Gibson, square face blocked with light\nand shadow from the actinic flare overhead, racing toward him through a\nsilently dispersing throng of Sadrians.\n\nThen he passed out.\n\n\n\nHe was strapped to his couch in the chart room when he awoke. The\n_Marco Four_ was already in space; on the visiscreen, Farrell could\nsee a dwindling crescent of Sadr III, and behind it, in the black pit\nof space, the fiery white eye of Deneb and the pyrotechnic glowing of\nAlbireo's blue-and-yellow twins.\n\n\"We're headed out,\" he said, bewildered. \"What happened?\"\n\nStryker came over and unstrapped him. Gibson, playing chess with Xavier\nacross the chart-room plotting table, looked up briefly and went back\nto his gambit.\n\n\"We reset the Ringwave in the dome to phase with ours and lugged you\nout,\" Stryker explained genially. He was back in character again, his\nfat paunch quivering with the beginning of laughter. \"We're through\nhere. The rest is up to Reorientation.\"\n\nFarrell gaped at him. \"You're giving up on Sadr III?\"\n\n\"We've done all we can. Those Sadrians need something that a\npreliminary expedition like ours can't give them. Right now they are\nwilling victims of a rigid religious code that makes it impossible for\nany one of them to express his wants, hopes, ideals or misfortunes to\nanother. Exchanging confidences, to them, is the ultimate sacrilege.\"\n\n\"Then they _are_ crazy. They'd have to be, with no more opportunity for\nemotional catharsis than that!\"\n\n\"They're not insane, they're--adapted. Those robot images you found\nare everything to this culture: arbiters, commercial agents, monitors\nand confessors all in one. They not only relay physical needs from one\nnative to another; they listen to all problems and give solutions.\nThey're _Counselors_, remember? Man's gregariousness stems largely from\nhis need to unload his troubles on someone else. The Hymenops came up\nwith an efficient substitute here, and the natives accepted it as the\nnorm.\"\n\nFarrell winced with sudden understanding. \"No wonder the poor devils\ncracked up right and left. With their Ringwave dead, they might as well\nhave been struck blind and dumb! They couldn't even get together among\nthemselves to figure a way out.\"\n\n\"There you have it,\" Stryker said. \"They knew we were responsible for\ntheir catastrophe, but they couldn't bring themselves to ask us for\nhelp because we were human beings like themselves. So they went mad one\nby one and committed the ultimate blasphemy of shouting their misery in\npublic, and their fellows had to kill them or countenance sacrilege.\nBut they'll quiet down now. They should be easy enough to handle by the\ntime the Reorientation lads arrive.\"\n\nHe began to chuckle. \"We left their Counselors running, but we\ndisconnected the hypnosis-renewal circuits. They'll get only what\nthey need from now on, which is an outlet for shifting their personal\nburdens. And with the post-hypnotic compulsion gone, they'll turn to\ncloser association with each other. Human gregariousness will reassert\nitself. After a couple of generations, the Reorientation boys can write\nthem off as Terran Normal and move on to the next planetary madhouse\nwe've dug up for them.\"\n\nFarrell said wonderingly, \"I never thought of the need to exchange\nconfidences as being so important. But it is; everyone does it. You and\nI often talk over personal concerns, and Gib--\"\n\nHe broke off to study the intent pair at the chessboard, comparing\nGibson's calm selfsufficiency to the mechanical's bland competence.\n\n\"There's an exception for your theory, Lee.
