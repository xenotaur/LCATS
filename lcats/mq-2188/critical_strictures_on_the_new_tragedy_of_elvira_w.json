FLEXNEY, near Gray's Inn, Holborn.\n                  MDCCLXIII.\n\n              (Price Sixpence.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement.[A]\n\nWe have followed the Authority of Sir _David Dalrymple_, and Mr.\n_Samuel Johnson_, in the Orthography of Mr. _Malloch_'s Name; as\nwe imagine the Decision of these Gentlemen will have more weight in the\nWorld of Letters, than even that of the said Mr. _Malloch_ himself.\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nCRITICAL\nSTRICTURES, &c.\n\nIn our Strictures on the Tragedy of _Elvira_, we shall not hasten all at\nonce into the midst of Things, according to the Rules of Epic Poetry;\nHeroic Poems and Remarks on New Plays, are things so essentially\ndifferent, that they ought not to be written by the same Rules. Had Mr.\n_Malloch_ been aware of these Distinctions in writing, which surely are\nnot very nice, he probably would have discovered that Scenes admirably\nadapted for forming a Burlesque Tragedy, would never succeed in forming\na serious Drama. In the Prologue the Author informs us, that the\nPreliminaries of Peace are signed, and the War now over and he humbly\nhopes, as we have spared the _French_, we will spare his Tragedy. But as\nthe Principles of Restitution seem at present strong in this Nation,\nbefore we extend our Mercy to him, we insist that in imitation of his\nSuperiors, he shall restore every thing valuable he has plunder'd from\nthe _French_ during the Course of his sad and tedious Composition.\n\nIn the first Scene of this Tragedy a Gentleman who has been abroad,\nduring the Wars, requests his Friend to acquaint him with what has past\nat Court in the time of his Absence. We were equally surprized and\ndelighted with this new Method of informing the Spectators of the\nTransactions prior to the Commencement of the Play; nothing can be more\nnatural, for we imagine the Art of conveying Letters by Post was at that\ntime undiscovered. We must indeed acknowledge, that during the time of\nthe Roman Empire Letters were transmitted with the utmost Celerity from\none Part to another of those immense Dominions; but we also know, that\nafter the Subversion of that State by the Incursions of the _Goths_ and\n_Vandals_, the first Act of Cruelty committed by these Barbarians was\nmurdering all the Post-Boys in cold Blood: In like manner as our inhuman\n_Edward_ upon his compleating the Conquest of _Wales_ ordered all the\nBards to be put to Death, amongst the Number of which had Mr. _Malloch_\nbeen included we had not now been tortured with his execrable Tragedy.\nNovelty of the same kind with this we have mentioned runs thro' the\nwhole Play, almost every Scene being an Interview and a _tete a tete_.\nThe King wants to see his Son, the Queen wants to see _Elvira_, _Elvira_\nwants to see the King, and so on thro' the Five Acts.\n\nNo new Thoughts or Sentiments are to be found in this Performance, we\nmeet only with old ones absurdly expressed. _Dryden_ said that _Ben\nJohnson_ was every where to be traced in the Snow of the Ancients. We\nmay say that _Malloch_ is every where to be traced in the Puddle of the\nModerns. Instead of selecting the Beauties, he has pick'd out whatever\nis despicable in _Shakespeare_, _Otway_, _Dryden_, and _Rowe_, like a\nPick-Pocket who dives for Handkerchiefs, not for Gold; and contents\nhimself with what he finds in our Great Coat Pocket, without attempting\nour Watch or your Purse. Tho' Mr. _Malloch_ may only mean to borrow, yet\nas he possesses no Fund of Original Genius from whence he can pay his\nDebts, borrowing, we are afraid is an inadequate Expression, the harsher\none of stealing we must therefore, tho' reluctantly, substitute in its\nroom. In the Prologue he acknowledges himself a Culprit, but as the Loss\nof what he has pilfered is insignificant to the Owners, we shall bring\nhim in guilty only of Petty Larcenary: We believe he has been driven,\nlike poor People in this severe Weather by dire Necessity, to such\ndishonest Shifts.\n\nIn this Play the Author has introduced a Rebellion unparalleled in\nany History, Ancient or Modern. He raises his Rebellions as a skilful\nGardener does his Mushrooms, in a Moment; and like an artful Nurse,\nhe lulls in a Moment the fretful Child asleep. The Prince enters an\nAppartment of the Palace with a drawn Sword; this forms the Rebellion.\nThe King enters the same Appartment without a drawn Sword. This quashes\nthe Rebellion. How to credit this Story, or to pardon this poetical\nLicence, we are greatly at a Loss; for we know in the Year 1745 three\nthousand Mountaineers actually appeared at _Derby_. _Cataline_, we are\ncredibly informed, had a Gang of at least a Dozen stout Fellows; and it\nis pretty certain that _Bedemar_, when going to inslave _Venice_, had\nprovided Pistols and Battle Powder for more than fifteen fighting Men.\nWe are almost tempted to think, that Mr. _Malloch_ gets his Rebellions\nready made, like his _Scotch_ Tobacco, cut and dry, at the Sign of the\nValiant Highlander.\n\nOur great Author possesses, in its utmost Perfection, the happy Art of\nuniting rival Ladies, and of setting at Variance a virtuous Father and\nSon. How intimate his Acquaintance with Human Nature! How deep his\nKnowledge of the Passions! No less exquisite and refined in his Morality,\nlike a true Disciple of Lord _Bolingbroke_, he unites Vice and Virtue\nmost lovingly together; witness this memorable Line of the King's,\naddressed to _Elvira_;\n\n    _'Midst all your Guilt I must admire your Virtue._\n\nLet us invert this Line,\n\n    'Midst all your Virtue I must abhor your Guilt.\n\nLet us parody it;\n\n    O Mr. _David Malloch_! 'midst all your Dullness I must admire\n        your Genius.\n\nWe heard it once asserted by _David Hume_, Esq;[B] that Mr. _Malloch_\nwas destitute of the Pathetic. In this Observation however we beg leave\nto differ with him. In the fourth Act the whole Board of Portuguese\nPrivy Counsellors are melted into Tears. The Trial of the Prince moves\nthe Hearts of those Monsters of Iniquity, those Members of Inquisition,\nwhen the less humane Audience are in Danger, from the Tediousness of two\ninsipid Harangues of falling fast asleep. This majestic Scene is too\nexactly copied from a Trial at the _Old Bailey_, to have even the Merit\nof Originality. And indeed it is to the Lenity of the King of _Portugal_\nthat we owe by far the greater Part of this amazing Play. The good Man\nlets his rebellious Subjects out of Prison to chat with him, when a\nwiser Monarch would have kept them close confined in _Newgate_. The\nincomparable Action of that universal Genius Mr. _Garrick_ alone, saved\nthis Act from the Damnation it deserved. Had not he, like a second\n_AEneas_, carried the old doating and decrepid Father on his Back, he\nmust have lain by the Way. Tho' we must observe another Character in\nthis Play seemed better suited to the Impetuosity and Fire of this\nActor. We could not but smile at the Humour of a merry Wag in the Pit,\nwho at the Conclusion of one of the most tiresome Pleadings, with some\nDegree of Impatience and Emotion called out, _Encore, encore_.\n\nIn the fifth Act we were melted with the Sight of two young Children\nwhich the King embraced, which the Prince embraced, which _Elvira_\nembraced. Mr. _Addison_ in the 44th No. of the _Spectator_, has some\nRemarks so judicious and lively on the Practice of introducing Children\non the Stage, that we must beg leave to transcribe the Passage.\n\n\"A disconsolate Mother with a Child in her Hand, has frequently drawn\nCompassion from the Audience, and has therefore gained a Place in\nseveral Tragedies; a modern Writer who observed how this had taken\nin other Plays, being resolved to double the Distress, and melt his\nAudience twice as much as those before him had done, brought a Princess\non the Stage with a little Boy in one Hand, and a Girl in the other. A\nthird Poet being resolved to out-write all his Predecessors, a few Years\nago introduced three Children with great Success; and as I am informed a\nyoung Gentleman who is fully determined to break the most obdurate\nHeart, has a Tragedy by him where the first Person that appears on the\nStage is an afflicted Widow, in her mourning Weeds, with half a dozen\nfatherless Children attending her, like those that usually hang about\nthe Figure of Charity. Thus several Incidents that are beautiful in a\ngood Writer become ridiculous by falling into the Hands of a bad one.\"\n\nWe would suggest to Mr. _Malloch_ the useful Hint of introducing in\nsome of his future Productions, the whole Foundling Hospital, which with\na well painted Scene of the Edifice itself would certainly call forth the\nwarmest Tears of Pity, and the bitterest Emotions of Distress; especially\nwhen we consider that many of the Parents of these unfortunate Babes would\nprobably be Spectators of this interesting Scene.\n\nThe Conclusion of the Piece is as abrupt as the other Parts of it are\nabsurd. We should be much at a Loss to guess by whom the Poison is\nadministered to _Elvira_, were we not aided in our Conjectures by the\nshrewd Suspicions which the King, tho' otherwise a very loving Husband,\nseems to entertain of his Wife. Upon my regreting that her Majesty, if\nguilty, should escape without poetical Justice at least, a Gentleman who\nsat behind me, a Friend as I supposed of the Author, assured me her\nPunishment was reserved for the Farce, which for that Purpose was,\ncontrary to Custom, added to the Play.[C]\n\nThough in general this Tragedy is colder than the most extreme Parts of\n_Nova Zembla_,[D] yet we now and then feel a Warmth, but it is such a\nWarmth or Glow rather, as is sometimes produced by the Handling of Snow.\n\nBad as this Play is, yet will the Author have the Profits of his Three\nNights: Few on the First Night having either Taste or Spirit to express\ntheir Disapprobation. Like the Rascals who plundered _Lisbon_ after\nthe Earthquake, Mr. _David Malloch_ will extract Guineas out of\nRubbish.\n\nWe shall now give, in a few Words, the Quintessence of this Play. Monarchs\nought to be just. Heroes are bad Men. Husbands ought to die for their\nWives, Wives for their Husbands. We ought to govern our Passions. And the\nSun shines on all alike. A few of these new Remarks form the Sum total of\nthis contemptible Piece.\n\nAfter the Play we were entertained with an Epilogue fraught with Humour,\nand spoken with Spirit. There was a Simile of a Bundle of Twigs formed\ninto a Rod, which seemed to convey a delicate Allusion to Mr.\n_Malloch_'s original Profession,[E] and some of the Lines contained an\nexquisite and severe Criticism on the Play itself.\n\nAmidst all the harshness inspired by a real Feeling of the Dulness of the\nComposition itself, it would be unjust not to bestow the highest Applause\non the principal Performers, by the Energy of whose Action even Dulness\nwas sometimes rendered respectable. We were sorry to find such great\nTalents so very ill employed. The melting Tones of a _Cibber_ should\nmake every Eye stream with Tears. _Pritchard_ should always elevate.\n_Garrick_ give Strength and Majesty to the Scene. Let us soften at\nthe keen Distress of a _Belvidera_; let our Souls rise with the\nDignity of an _Elizabeth_; let us tremble at the wild Madness of a\n_Lear_;[F] but let us not Yawn at the Stupidity of uninteresting\nCharacters.\n\n\n                  _FINIS_\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\nNOTES ON _CRITICAL STRICTURES_\n\n[Footnote A: (P. 5) Advertisement. Johnson's dictum first appeared in\nthe abridgment of his dictionary, 1756, under _Alias_, which he defined\nas \"A Latin word signifying otherwise; as Mallet _alias_ Mallock; that\nis, _otherwise_ Mallock.\" In four places in his _Memorials and Letters\nRelating to the History of Britain in the Reign of James the First_\n(1762) Dalrymple had given Mallet \"his real name\"; he had repented after\nthe sheets were printed and had inserted a corrigendum, \"For Malloch, r.\nMallet,\" which only made matters worse. See _The Yale Edition of Horace\nWalpole's Correspondence_, iv. 78 _n._ 17. Dalrymple chided the\nauthors of _Critical Strictures_ gently for using his name, and said\nhe was sorry for having thus yielded to a private pique (LJ, p. 190\n_n._ 6). But the matter remained of interest to him, for as late as\n1783 he sent Johnson a copy of one of Mallet's earliest productions, the\ntitle-page of which bore the name in its original spelling (_Life_,\niv. 216-217; see also _Private Papers of James Boswell ... in the\nCollection of ... R.H. Isham_, ed. Geoffrey Scott and F.A. Pottle, 18\nvols., Privately Printed, 1928-1934, xv. 208).]\n\n[Footnote B: (P. 15) \"We heard it once asserted by _David Hume_, Esq.\" On\n4 November 1762, in Hume's house in James's Court, Edinburgh. \"Mr. Mallet\nhas written bad Tragedies because he is deficient in the pathetic, and\nhence it is doubted if he is the Author of _William and Margaret_.\nMr. Hume said he knew people who had seen it before Mallet was born.\nErskine gave another proof, viz. that he has written _Edwin and\nEmma_, a Ballad in the same stile, not near so good.\" See _Private\nPapers_ (as in the note preceding this), i. 126-127, or the Limited\nEdition of _Boswell's London Journal, 1762-1763_, McGraw-Hill and\nHeinemann, 1951, p. 101. Hume protested vigorously, though with good\nhumor, at this breach of confidence, and Boswell wrote a flippant reply\n(LJ, pp. 206-207, 208-209).]\n\n[Footnote C: (P. 20) \"... her Punishment was reserved for the Farce, which\nfor that Purpose was, contrary to Custom, added to the Play.\" Stock plays\nwere always followed by an afterpiece, but the afterpiece was in most\ncases omitted during the first run of a new play. For example, Mrs.\nSheridan's _Discovery_ opened 3 February 1763 and ran for ten nights before\nan afterpiece was added. The afterpieces presented with _Elvira_ up to\n27 January were as follows: 19 January, _The Male Coquette_ (Garrick);\n20 January, _High Life Below Stairs_ (Townley); 21 January, _Old\nMaid_ (Murphy); 22 January, _Catharine and Petruchio_ (Garrick's\nadaptation of Shakespeare's _Taming of the Shrew_); 24 January, _High\nLife Below Stairs_; 26 January, _Catharine and Petruchio_; 27\nJanuary, _Edgar and Emmeline_ (Hawkesworth). But Mrs. Pritchard, who\nplayed the Queen in _Elvira_, seems not to have appeared in any of\nthese afterpieces, and no one of them contains a queen (Dougald MacMillan,\n_Drury Lane Calendar_, 1747-1776, Clarendon Press, 1938, pp. 94, 217,\n239, 260, 282, 297). Furthermore, if the jest could be understood only\nwith reference to a particular farce, that farce would surely have been\nnamed. This is no doubt a case where less is meant than meets the ear.\nThe authors are merely saying that Mallet's play is badly constructed,\nand is so ridiculous generally that no one will know when the tragedy\nends and the farce begins.]\n\n[Footnote D: (P. 21) \"Though in general this Tragedy is colder than the\nmost extreme Parts of _Nova Zembla_ ...\" This is perhaps the only passage\nin _Critical Strictures_ that can be attributed with certainty to one of\nthe three authors. The remark is Dempster's, and had been made some time\nbefore Elvira was presented; in fact, he had applied it originally to\nJohnson's _Irene_. See LJ, pp. 69, 306.]\n\n[Footnote E: (P. 22) \"... a Simile of a Bundle of Twigs formed into a\nRod ... Mr. _Malloch_'s original Profession ...\" Garrick's epilogue to\n_Elvira_ contains the following lines:\n\n    A single critick will not frown, look big,\n    Harmless and pliant as a single twig,\n    But crouded _here_ they change, and 'tis not odd,\n    For twigs when bundled up, become a rod.\n\nOne of Mallet's duties, when he was janitor of the High School of\nEdinburgh, had been to assist in the floggings, either by applying the\ninstrument of punishment himself (see LJ, p. 209) or by lifting the boys\nup on his back at the command of _tollatur_ and exposing the proper\nportion of their anatomy to the master's birch (John Ramsay, _Scotland\nand Scotsmen in the Eighteenth Century_, Blackwood, Edinburgh and\nLondon, 1888, i. 24 _n_.)]\n\n[Footnote F: (Pp. 23-24) \"... keen Distress of a _Belvidera_,... Dignity\nof an _Elizabeth_;... wild Madness of a _Lear_.\" The authors are listing\nwhat they conceive to be the most impressive tragic roles of Mrs. Cibber,\nMrs. Pritchard, and Garrick, who played respectively Elvira, the Queen,\nand the King in _Elvira_. Belvidera in Otway's _Venice Preserved_\nwas by all accounts one of Mrs. Cibber's best parts. It had been\nassigned to her in the majority of the Drury Lane performances since 1747,\nand she had appeared in it as recently as 16 November 1762. Mrs. Pritchard\nhad played Queen Elizabeth in all the Drury Lane performances (1755-1760)\nof _The Earl of Essex_ by Henry Jones and of the play of the same\nname by Henry Brooke (1761-), but had appeared in neither role more\nrecently than 30 December 1761. A role of Elizabeth which she had\npresented more recently (18 December 1762) and had been appearing\nregularly in since 1748 was the Queen Elizabeth of Shakespeare's\n_Richard III_ as altered by Cibber. It is probably this last named\nElizabeth that the authors of _Critical Strictures_ had in mind. The\nchoice is unusual, critics generally having considered Lady Macbeth to\nbe her finest tragic role. Garrick had played Lear on 31 December 1762\n(_Drury Lane Calendar_, as above, pp. 237-238, 268, 313-315, 338).]\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\nPUBLICATIONS OF THE AUGUSTAN REPRINT SOCIETY\n\n\nFIRST YEAR (1946-47)\n\nNumbers 1-4 out of print.\n\n5.
