hesitating then no longer,\n  \"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\n  But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\n  And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\n  That I scarce was sure I heard you\"--here I opened wide the door--\n                                     Darkness there and nothing more.\n\n  Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\n  Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;\n  But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\n  And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore?\"\n  This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\"--\n                                     Merely this and nothing more.\n\n  Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\n  Soon again I heard a tapping something louder than before.\n  \"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice;\n  Let me see, then, what thereat is and this mystery explore--\n  Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;--\n                                     'Tis the wind and nothing more.\n\n  Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\n  In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.\n  Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he,\n  But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--\n  Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--\n                                     Perched, and sat, and nothing more.\n\n  Then the ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\n  By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n  \"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no craven,\n  Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore--\n  Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\"\n                                     Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\n  Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\n  Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;\n  For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\n  Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--\n  Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\n                                     With such name as \"Nevermore.\"\n\n  But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only\n  That one word, as if its soul in that one word he did outpour\n  Nothing farther then he uttered; not a feather then he fluttered--\n  Till I scarcely more than muttered: \"Other friends have flown before--\n  On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.\"\n                                     Then the bird said \"Nevermore.\"\n\n  Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n  \"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store,\n  Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\n  Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--\n  Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\n                                     Of 'Never--nevermore.'\"\n\n  But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,\n  Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;\n  Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\n  Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--\n  What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\n                                     Meant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"\n\n  This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\n  To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;\n  This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\n  On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,\n  But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er\n                                     _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!\n\n  Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\n  Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n  \"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath sent thee\n  Respite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!\n  Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!\"\n                                     Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\n  \"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!--\n  Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\n  Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--\n  On this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore--\n  Is there--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!\"\n                                     Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\n  \"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!\n  By that Heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore--\n  Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\n  It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--\n  Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"\n                                     Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\n  \"Be that our sign of parting, bird or fiend!\" I shrieked, upstarting--\n  \"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!\n  Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul has spoken!\n  Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!\n  Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"\n                                     Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\n  And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\n  On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\n  And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming\n  And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadows on the floor;\n  And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\n                                     Shall be lifted--nevermore!\n\n\n\n\nThe Masque of the Red Death\n\nOctober, 1997  [Etext #1064]*\n\n\n\n\nThe Masque of the Red Death\n\n\nThe \"Red Death\" had long devastated the country.  No pestilence had\never been so fatal, or so hideous.  Blood was its Avatar and its\nseal--the redness and the horror of blood.  There were sharp pains, and\nsudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with\ndissolution.  The scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the\nface of the victim, were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid\nand from the sympathy of his fellow-men. And the whole seizure,\nprogress and termination of the disease, were the incidents of half an\nhour.\n\nBut the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious. When his\ndominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand\nhale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his\ncourt, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his\ncastellated abbeys.  This was an extensive and magnificent structure,\nthe creation of the prince's own eccentric yet august taste.  A strong\nand lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of iron.  The\ncourtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and\nwelded the bolts.  They resolved to leave means neither of ingress nor\negress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within.  The\nabbey was amply provisioned.  With such precautions the courtiers might\nbid defiance to contagion.  The external world could take care of\nitself.  In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or to think.  The\nprince had provided all the appliances of pleasure.  There were\nbuffoons, there were improvisatori, there were ballet-dancers, there\nwere musicians, there was Beauty, there was wine.  All these and\nsecurity were within.  Without was the \"Red Death\".\n\nIt was towards the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion,\nand while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that the Prince\nProspero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most\nunusual magnificence.\n\nIt was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade.  But first let me tell of\nthe rooms in which it was held.  These were seven--an imperial suite.\nIn many palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista,\nwhile the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand,\nso that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded.  Here the\ncase was very different, as might have been expected from the duke's\nlove of the _bizarre_.  The apartments were so irregularly disposed that\nthe vision embraced but little more than one at a time.  There was a\nsharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel\neffect.  To the right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and\nnarrow Gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued\nthe windings of the suite.  These windows were of stained glass whose\ncolour varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations\nof the chamber into which it opened.  That at the eastern extremity was\nhung, for example in blue--and vividly blue were its windows.  The\nsecond chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the\npanes were purple.  The third was green throughout, and so were the\ncasements.  The fourth was furnished and lighted with orange--the fifth\nwith white--the sixth with violet.  The seventh apartment was closely\nshrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and\ndown the walls, falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same\nmaterial and hue.  But in this chamber only, the colour of the windows\nfailed to correspond with the decorations.  The panes here were\nscarlet--a deep blood colour.  Now in no one of the seven apartments\nwas there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden\nornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof.\nThere was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the\nsuite of chambers.  But in the corridors that followed the suite, there\nstood, opposite to each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a brazier of\nfire, that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly\nillumined the room.  And thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and\nfantastic appearances.  But in the western or black chamber the effect\nof the fire-light that streamed upon the dark hangings through the\nblood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the extreme, and produced so wild a\nlook upon the countenances of those who entered, that there were few of\nthe company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.\n\nIt was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the western\nwall, a gigantic clock of ebony.  Its pendulum swung to and fro with a\ndull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand made the\ncircuit of the face, and the hour was to be stricken, there came from\nthe brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep\nand exceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that,\nat each lapse of an hour, the musicians of the orchestra were\nconstrained to pause, momentarily, in their performance, to harken to\nthe sound; and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and\nthere was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the\nchimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew\npale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows\nas if in confused revery or meditation.  But when the echoes had fully\nceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians\nlooked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and\nfolly, and made whispering vows, each to the other, that the next\nchiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion; and\nthen, after the lapse of sixty minutes, (which embrace three thousand\nand six hundred seconds of the Time that flies,) there came yet another\nchiming of the clock, and then were the same disconcert and\ntremulousness and meditation as before.\n\nBut, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel.  The\ntastes of the duke were peculiar.  He had a fine eye for colours and\neffects.  He disregarded the _decora_ of mere fashion.  His plans were\nbold and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre.  There\nare some who would have thought him mad.  His followers felt that he\nwas not.  It was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be _sure_\nthat he was not.\n\nHe had directed, in great part, the movable embellishments of the seven\nchambers, upon occasion of this great _f\u00c3\u00aate_; and it was his own guiding\ntaste which had given character to the masqueraders.  Be sure they were\ngrotesque.  There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and\nphantasm--much of what has been since seen in  \"Hernani\".  There were\narabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments.  There were\ndelirious fancies such as the madman fashions.  There were much of the\nbeautiful, much of the wanton, much of the _bizarre_, something of the\nterrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust.\nTo and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of\ndreams.  And these--the dreams--writhed in and about taking hue from\nthe rooms, and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the\necho of their steps.  And, anon, there strikes the ebony clock which\nstands in the hall of the velvet.  And then, for a moment, all is\nstill, and all is silent save the voice of the clock.  The dreams are\nstiff-frozen as they stand.  But the echoes of the chime die away--they\nhave endured but an instant--and a light, half-subdued laughter floats\nafter them as they depart.  And now again the music swells, and the\ndreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue\nfrom the many tinted windows through which stream the rays from the\ntripods.  But to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven,\nthere are now none of the maskers who venture; for the night is waning\naway; and there flows a ruddier light through the blood-coloured panes;\nand the blackness of the sable drapery appals; and to him whose foot\nfalls upon the sable carpet, there comes from the near clock of ebony a\nmuffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches _their_ ears\nwho indulged in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments.\n\nBut these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat\nfeverishly the heart of life.  And the revel went whirlingly on, until\nat length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock.  And\nthen the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the\nwaltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things\nas before.  But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell\nof the clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought\ncrept, with more of time, into the meditations of the thoughtful among\nthose who revelled. And thus too, it happened, perhaps, that before the\nlast echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were\nmany individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of\nthe presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no\nsingle individual before.  And the rumour of this new presence having\nspread itself whisperingly around, there arose at length from the whole\ncompany a buzz, or murmur, expressive of disapprobation and\nsurprise--then, finally, of terror, of horror, and of disgust.\n\nIn an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be\nsupposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation.\nIn truth the masquerade licence of the night was nearly unlimited; but\nthe figure in question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the\nbounds of even the prince's indefinite decorum. There are chords in the\nhearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion.\nEven with the utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests,\nthere are matters of which no jest can be made.  The whole company,\nindeed, seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of\nthe stranger neither wit nor propriety existed.  The figure was tall\nand gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the\ngrave.  The mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to\nresemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest\nscrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat.  And yet all\nthis might have been endured, if not approved, by the mad revellers\naround.  But the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the\nRed Death. His vesture was dabbled in  _blood_--and his broad brow, with\nall the features of the face, was besprinkled with the scarlet horror.\n\nWhen the eyes of the Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image\n(which, with a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain\nits  role, stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be\nconvulsed, in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror\nor distaste; but, in the next, his brow reddened with rage.\n\n\"Who dares,\"--he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near\nhim--\"who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery? Seize him and\nunmask him--that we may know whom we have to hang, at sunrise, from the\nbattlements!\"\n\nIt was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince\nProspero as he uttered these words.  They rang throughout the seven\nrooms loudly and clearly, for the prince was a bold and robust man, and\nthe music had become hushed at the waving of his hand.\n\nIt was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of  pale\ncourtiers by his side.  At first, as he spoke, there was a slight\nrushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who at\nthe moment was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and stately\nstep, made closer approach to the speaker.  But from a certain nameless\nawe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole\nparty, there were found none who put forth hand to seize him; so that,\nunimpeded, he passed within a yard of the prince's person; and, while\nthe vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of\nthe rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the\nsame solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the\nfirst, through the blue chamber to the purple--through the purple to\nthe green--through the green to the orange--through this again to the\nwhite--and even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been\nmade to arrest him.  It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero,\nmaddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice,\nrushed hurriedly through the six chambers, while none followed him on\naccount of a deadly terror that had seized upon all.  He bore aloft a\ndrawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three\nor four feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained\nthe extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted\nhis pursuer.  There was a sharp cry--and the dagger dropped gleaming\nupon the sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards, fell prostrate\nin death the Prince Prospero.  Then, summoning the wild courage of\ndespair, a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the\nblack apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect\nand motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in\nunutterable horror at finding the grave cerements and corpse-like mask,\nwhich they handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any\ntangible form.\n\nAnd now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death.  He had come\nlike a thief in the night.  And one by one dropped the revellers in the\nblood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing\nposture of his fall.  And the life of the ebony clock went out with\nthat of the last of the gay.  And the flames of the tripods expired.\nAnd Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over\nall.\n\n\n\n\nThe Cask of Amontillado\n\nOctober, 1997  [Etext #1065]*\n\n\n\nThe Cask of Amontillado\n\n\nThe thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could, but\nwhen he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge.  You, who so well know\nthe nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance\nto a threat.  _At length_ I would be avenged; this was a point\ndefinitely settled--but the very definitiveness with which it was\nresolved, precluded the idea of risk.  I must not only punish, but\npunish with impunity.  A wrong is unredressed when retribution\novertakes its redresser.  It is equally unredressed when the avenger\nfails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.\n\nIt must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given\nFortunato cause to doubt my good will.  I continued, as was my wont, to\nsmile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile _now_ was at\nthe thought of his immolation.\n\nHe had a weak point--this Fortunato--although in other regards he was a\nman to be respected and even feared.  He prided himself on his\nconnoisseurship in wine.  Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit.\nFor the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and\nopportunity--to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian\n_millionaires_.  In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen,\nwas a quack--but in the matter of old wines he was sincere.  In this\nrespect I did not differ from him materially: I was skillful in the\nItalian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could.\n\nIt was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the\ncarnival season, that I encountered my friend.  He accosted me with\nexcessive warmth, for he had been drinking much.  The man wore motley.\nHe had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was\nsurmounted by the conical cap and bells.  I was so pleased to see him,\nthat I thought I should never have done wringing his hand.\n\nI said to him--\"My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met.  How remarkably\nwell you are looking to-day!  But I have received a pipe of what passes\nfor Amontillado, and I have my doubts.\"\n\n\"How?\" said he.  \"Amontillado?  A pipe?  Impossible!  And in the middle\nof the carnival!\"\n\n\"I have my doubts,\" I replied; \"and I was silly enough to pay the full\nAmontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to\nbe found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.\"\n\n\"Amontillado!\"\n\n\"I have my doubts.\"\n\n\"Amontillado!\"\n\n\"And I must satisfy them.\"\n\n\"Amontillado!\"\n\n\"As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi.  If any one has a\ncritical turn, it is he.  He will tell me--\"\n\n\"Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.\"\n\n\"And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your\nown.\"\n\n\"Come, let us go.\"\n\n\"Whither?\"\n\n\"To your vaults.\"\n\n\"My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature.  I perceive\nyou have an engagement.  Luchesi--\"\n\n\"I have no engagement;--come.\"\n\n\"My friend, no.  It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with\nwhich I perceive you are afflicted.  The vaults are insufferably damp.\nThey are encrusted with nitre.\"\n\n\"Let us go, nevertheless.  The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! You\nhave been imposed upon.  And as for Luchesi, he cannot distinguish\nSherry from Amontillado.\"\n\nThus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm. Putting on a mask\nof black silk, and drawing a _roquelaire_ closely about my person, I\nsuffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.\n\nThere were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in\nhonour of the time.  I had told them that I should not return until the\nmorning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house.\nThese orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate\ndisappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.\n\nI took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato,\nbowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into\nthe vaults.  I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting him\nto be cautious as he followed. We came at length to the foot of the\ndescent, and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the\nMontresors.\n\nThe gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled\nas he strode.\n\n\"The pipe,\" said he.\n\n\"It is farther on,\" said I; \"but observe the white web-work which\ngleams from these cavern walls.\"\n\nHe turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that\ndistilled the rheum of intoxication.\n\n\"Nitre?\" he asked, at length.\n\n\"Nitre,\" I replied.  \"How long have you had that cough?\"\n\n\"Ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh!\nugh! ugh!\"\n\nMy poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.\n\n\"It is nothing,\" he said, at last.\n\n\"Come,\" I said, with decision, \"we will go back; your health is\nprecious.  You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as\nonce I was.  You are a man to be missed.  For me it is no matter.  We\nwill go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be responsible.  Besides,\nthere is Luchesi--\"\n\n\"Enough,\" he said; \"the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill me. I\nshall not die of a cough.\"\n\n\"True--true,\" I replied; \"and, indeed, I had no intention of alarming\nyou unnecessarily--but you should use all proper caution. A draught of\nthis Medoc will defend us from the damps.\"\n\nHere I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of\nits fellows that lay upon the mould.\n\n\"Drink,\" I said, presenting him the wine.\n\nHe raised it to his lips with a leer.  He paused and nodded to me\nfamiliarly, while his bells jingled.\n\n\"I drink,\" he said, \"to the buried that repose around us.\"\n\n\"And I to your long life.\"\n\nHe again took my arm, and we proceeded.\n\n\"These vaults,\" he said, \"are extensive.\"\n\n\"The Montresors,\" I replied, \"were a great and numerous family.\"\n\n\"I forget your arms.\"\n\n\"A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent\nrampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.\"\n\n\"And the motto?\"\n\n\"_Nemo me impune lacessit_.\"\n\n\"Good!\" he said.\n\nThe wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled.  My own fancy grew\nwarm with the Medoc.  We had passed through walls of piled bones, with\ncasks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of\ncatacombs.  I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize\nFortunato by an arm above the elbow.\n\n\"The nitre!\" I said; \"see, it increases.  It hangs like moss upon the\nvaults.  We are below the river's bed.  The drops of moisture trickle\namong the bones.  Come, we will go back ere it is too late.  Your\ncough--\"\n\n\"It is nothing,\" he said; \"let us go on.  But first, another draught of\nthe Medoc.\"\n\nI broke and reached him a flagon of De Grave.  He emptied it at a\nbreath.  His eyes flashed with a fierce light.  He laughed and threw\nthe bottle upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand.\n\nI looked at him in surprise.  He repeated the movement--a grotesque one.\n\n\"You do not comprehend?\" he said.\n\n\"Not I,\" I replied.\n\n\"Then you are not of the brotherhood.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"You are not of the masons.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" I said; \"yes, yes.\"\n\n\"You?  Impossible!  A mason?\"\n\n\"A mason,\" I replied.\n\n\"A sign,\" he said, \"a sign.\"\n\n\"It is this,\" I answered, producing a trowel from beneath the folds of\nmy _roquelaire_.\n\n\"You jest,\" he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces.  \"But let us proceed\nto the Amontillado.\"\n\n\"Be it so,\" I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again\noffering him my arm.  He leaned upon it heavily.  We continued our\nroute in search of the Amontillado.  We passed through a range of low\narches, descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep\ncrypt, in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to\nglow than flame.\n\nAt the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less\nspacious.  Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the\nvault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris.  Three\nsides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. From\nthe fourth side the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously\nupon the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size.  Within the\nwall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we perceived a still\ninterior recess, in depth about four feet in width three, in height six\nor seven.  It seemed to have been constructed for no especial use\nwithin itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the\ncolossal supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one\nof their circumscribing walls of solid granite.\n\nIt was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavoured to\npry into the depth of the recess.  Its termination the feeble light did\nnot enable us to see.\n\n\"Proceed,\" I said; \"herein is the Amontillado.  As for Luchesi--\"\n\n\"He is an ignoramus,\" interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily\nforward, while I followed immediately at his heels.  In an instant he\nhad reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress\narrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered.  A moment more and I\nhad fettered him to the granite.  In its surface were two iron staples,\ndistant from each other about two feet, horizontally.  From one of\nthese depended a short chain, from the other a padlock.  Throwing the\nlinks about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure\nit.  He was too much astounded to resist.  Withdrawing the key I\nstepped back from the recess.\n\n\"Pass your hand,\" I said, \"over the wall; you cannot help feeling the\nnitre.  Indeed, it is _very_ damp.  Once more let me _implore_ you to\nreturn.  No?  Then I must positively leave you. But I must first render\nyou all the little attentions in my power.\"\n\n\"The Amontillado!\" ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his\nastonishment.\n\n\"True,\" I replied; \"the Amontillado.\"\n\nAs I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which\nI have before spoken.  Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity\nof building stone and mortar.  With these materials and with the aid of\nmy trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.\n\nI had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when I discovered\nthat the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off. The\nearliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth\nof the recess.  It was _not_ the cry of a drunken man. There was then a\nlong and obstinate silence.  I laid the second tier, and the third, and\nthe fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain.  The\nnoise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to\nit with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labours and sat down upon\nthe bones. When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel,\nand finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh\ntier.  The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast.  I again\npaused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few\nfeeble rays upon the figure within.\n\nA succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the\nthroat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back.  For a\nbrief moment I hesitated--I trembled.  Unsheathing my rapier, I began\nto grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant\nreassured me.  I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs,\nand felt satisfied.  I reapproached the wall; I replied to the yells of\nhim who clamoured.  I re-echoed--I aided--I surpassed them in volume\nand in strength.  I did this, and the clamourer grew still.\n\nIt was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close.  I had\ncompleted the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier.  I had finished a\nportion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone\nto be fitted and plastered in.  I struggled with its weight; I placed\nit partially in its destined position.  But now there came from out the\nniche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head.  It was\nsucceeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognizing as that\nof the noble Fortunato.  The voice said--\n\n\"Ha! ha! ha!--he! he! he!--a very good joke indeed--an excellent jest.\nWe shall have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo--he! he!\nhe!--over our wine--he! he! he!\"\n\n\"The Amontillado!\" I said.\n\n\"He! he! he!--he! he! he!--yes, the Amontillado.  But is it not getting\nlate?  Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady Fortunato\nand the rest?  Let us be gone.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"let us be gone.\"\n\n\"_For the love of God, Montresor!_\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"for the love of God!\"\n\nBut to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply.  I grew impatient.\nI called aloud--\n\n\"Fortunato!\"\n\nNo answer.  I called again--\n\n\"Fortunato--\"\n\nNo answer still.  I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and\nlet it fall within.  There came forth in reply only a jingling of the\nbells.  My heart grew sick on account of the dampness of the catacombs.\nI hastened to make an end of my labour.  I forced the last stone into\nits position; I plastered it up.  Against the new masonry I re-erected\nthe old rampart of bones.  For the half of a century no mortal has\ndisturbed them.  _In pace requiescat!_",
