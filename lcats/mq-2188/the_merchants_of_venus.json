Nothing good\nhad come from that phone in six years, and his sour expression was\nalmost an automatic reflex.\n\n\"Workham here,\" he said.\n\nHe held the phone an inch away from his ear, but the tirade exceeded his\nexpectations--it would have been audible a foot away:\n\n\"Workham! How long do you think we're going to stand for this! At the\nrate you're going, there won't be a man left on Venus or a dollar in the\nbudget! What kind of a personnel director are you? Don't you know this\nproject is vital to every person on Earth? Thirty more resignations came\nin on this last mail flight.\"\n\nRod put the receiver gently on his desk. General Carlson raved and\nranted this way every time a colonist quit, and Rod knew he was not\nexpected to answer, even if given the chance. The general would carry on\nfor about five minutes and then would slam down the phone himself.\n\nHe dialed another number on the other phone.\n\n\"This is Rod, Dave,\" he said when he got an answer. \"Carlson is on the\nother phone, yelling at my desk blotter. He says thirty more\nresignations came in just now. That right?\"\n\n\"Close enough, Rod--twenty-three pulled out. That makes seventy-eight\nper cent resigned in less than--\"\n\n\"Spare me the statistics--Carlson's probably blatting them right now.\nHow do they break down? Are they mostly farmers or technicians?\"\n\n\"There were only nine technicians left, and all of them quit with this\nbunch. The rest were farmers.\" Dave Newson must be smoking his pipe, Rod\ndecided--grinding sounds were coming over the phone. \"That doesn't leave\nvery much on Venus to start a colony with--a few farmers, some trappers.\nAnd the scientific personnel--damn it, they seem to stick it out all\nright--\"\n\n\"Their contracts are different,\" Rod reminded him. \"They go on a two\nyear hitch and then come back to Earth if they want to. The ones who are\nthere are the ones who can take it and are signed up again.\"\n\n\n\nThere was a speculative pause on the other end of the line. \"Say, Rod,\"\nNewson said slowly. \"Why not leave this last batch of quitters right\nwhere they are? Every one of them. They signed up for the project with\ntheir eyes open. Why don't you just refuse to bring them home? ...\nthey'd have to make a go of the colony to save their filthy necks!\"\n\nRod grinned nastily. \"I'd like to do it--but even General Carlson\nwouldn't dare. We'd never get another colonist off Earth, once it got\nout. They wouldn't trust us. Our first problem is to get a\nself-supporting society on Venus--and that might do it, all right. But\nour main job is to relieve the crowding on Earth, and that means large\nnumbers of people will have to go willingly later on. If we get tough\nwith these babies, who will take a chance later on that we won't repeat\nthe trick?\"\n\n\"But we lose a hundred potential colonists every time one of these\nquitters starts talking about why he left! More harm is done by letting\nthem come back than would result from leaving them where they are.\"\nAgain the speculative pause. \"Maybe you could shoot them on arrival?\"\n\n\"I'll suggest it to the general when I see him,\" Rod said, \"if he\ndoesn't shoot me first. Now, can you get me the files on this latest\ngroup? And I'd like to see the staff psychologist here, along with all\nthe interviewers who handled and passed the group. We'll see what we can\nsalvage out of this. And if you see Jaimie, send him along too, will\nyou? Maybe our gambling historian can find us something useful in the\nProject Record.\"\n\n\"The files are already on the way. And I told Biddington you'd probably\nwant to see him--he said he'd be along in about ten minutes. I haven't\nlocated all the interviewers yet. Jaimie's been right here, trying to\ntalk me into a game of Nim and protesting he never heard of binary\nnumbers. I'll send him up, but keep your hand on your wallet. If you\nneed anything else, I'll be right here.\"\n\n\n\nRod thanked him and hung up, shaking his head. Dave Newsom was too good\na man to be stuck on a government project--he ought to get out before\nthe trouble started. Anyone who worked for Rod Workham on Project Venus\nwas likely to end up with a bad name. They lived under the ax. The only\nperson who could be sure of his job was Rod himself. He'd been\nrecommended by a committee of top men in his field, and no other\npersonnel man would accept the job if he were removed. Also, most of his\nmen would leave the project if General Carlson bounced him, for they had\nbeen telling him so ever since the job had gotten hot.\n\nBut there was the danger that the general might decide to bypass\nPersonnel in selecting colonists--or, what was more probable, might try\nto tame the planet with a military outpost.\n\nRod could hardly blame the man for his feelings. The job was vital, and\neveryone was intensely interested in making a go of it. Scientific\nagriculture had gone about as far as it could; hydroponics had already\nbegun to shoulder the load required by an overpopulated planet. But the\nfact known to most intelligent people on Earth was that either new room\nwas found in this kind of emergency, some place where people could go\nand live under nearly the same standards, or else some drastic changes\nin living standards would be required of all. And absolute and rigidly\nenforced birth control would have to go into effect. And all the\nattendant causes for race wars, nationalist wars, and have-not wars\nwould crop up.\n\nBut the majority of the people wouldn't move to an undeveloped planet.\nYou couldn't send ordinary citizens as pioneers. For one thing, they\nwouldn't want to go. For another, the new community wouldn't last long\nif you forced them to go--the average person had neither the attitudes\nnor the physique needed to make over a wilderness.\n\nThe problem was to find people who would create a community on a new\nplanet and develop an integrated society there. This had meant rigid\nselection, careful psychological preparation and a terrifically\nexpensive transportation system to get the people there and keep them\nsupplied. And the job had to be done soon. Economists predicted that\nthirty years were left on Earth under present standards, maybe fifty. If\nthe population couldn't be thinned out one way by then, it would have to\nbe done by another.\n\n\n\nFor six years, now, Rod had worked on the job of establishing a\nself-supporting colony on Venus. Three different colonies had been\nstarted, and each had died out in less than two years. Resignations\nwould come in slowly at first, and then in a rush, until only twenty or\nthirty people would be left, of which the majority would be short-term\nscientific teams. By the terms of the colonists' contracts no man could\nbe left on Venus more than a month after his resignation; so the bulk of\ntwo colonies had simply had to be shipped back to Earth, and plans made\nfor another try.\n\nAnd now the third colony was quitting, rushing home, leaving nothing on\nthe jungle planet but a few small clearings soon to be taken over by the\nvegetation.\n\nSeveral times in the last year Rod had thought of volunteering himself;\nbut he knew it for a futile gesture. He wasn't five hundred men. He\ndidn't even have the special skills or physique that were needed.\n\nHis gloomy thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of the men.\n\nBiddington was first. Then in twos and threes came the interviewers, all\nlooking like the home team at the half, three touchdowns behind and just\nwaiting for their coach.\n\nIf psychologists made good colonists, Rod thought, here would be a dozen\nmore volunteers.\n\nThe arrival of Homer Jaimison brought the only cheerful face in the\ngroup. The project historian was a young man, just over thirty, and\nconsiderably over six feet. He wore the expression of a man who is\nitching to do something. Jaimie had never really been busy yet on the\nproject--the colonies had died out so quickly that his work had been\nmostly clerical, and he'd had to fill in time as best he could. So far\nhe had done it making up improbable contests of skill for drinks, with\nsuch a weird assortment of shifting rules and scoring that he hadn't\npaid for a drink since his arrival. He made a valuable contribution to\nthe project, however, since he helped to keep the group's minds off\ntheir troubles a part of the time.\n\nRod genuinely liked Jaimie, and expected to miss him strongly when Venus\nbecame self-supporting to the point where the historian would have to\ncomplete his work in residence.\n\n\n\nWhen they were all seated, Rod leaned against his desk and said, \"I can\nsee you all know why we're here. To begin with, I'm not going to accuse\nanyone of mistakes. Each of you is the best possible man in the country\nfor his job. If you weren't, you wouldn't be here. I wouldn't have asked\nfor you; and General Carlson wouldn't have kept you. So there's nothing\nto feel bad about. If you can't do this work, no one can.\nSelf-recrimination is foolish when you've been put on an impossible\nproblem. I didn't call you in to bawl you out, but to ask you if we\nshould continue spending project funds for nothing.\"\n\nJaimie raised his eyebrows at this speech, but said nothing.\n\n\"What do you mean, impossible problem?\" one of the interviewers\nobjected. \"We know what we need--it's just that we're still making some\nmistake in selection that we haven't corrected.\"\n\n\"That's right, Rod.\" Biddington, the project psychologist, took up the\ndissension. \"We know something is wrong with the selection techniques,\nor in the personality patterns we consider necessary. But it's only a\nproblem of finding out what it is. The problem is by no means\ninsoluble.\"\n\n\"As long as you're not ready to give us up,\" another interviewer said,\n\"we aren't going to quit.\"\n\n\"You can't afford to get defeatist about this, Rod,\" Biddington went on.\n\"This project is too important to fail. Whether you like it or not, your\nexperience is too valuable for you to back out.\"\n\nRod grinned and held up his hands. \"All right. That's the reaction I\nwanted. If you all still think we can get somewhere, we may as well try\nto analyze this last group.\" He sat down at his desk. \"I have the files\nhere, along with the tapes of the interviews. Let's see what difference\nwe can find between those who hung on this long, and the ones that quit\nafter the first three months.\"\n\n\n\nThe group settled down to trying to differentiate between a man who\ncouldn't do a job but could try for six months longer than the next.\nThey took the colonists carefully apart, trait by trait, and put them\nall back. They reviewed the colonists' records from birth, and compared\nthem in endless combinations. Jaimie came into the discussion to show\nwhat the status of the colonies had been at the time each colonist had\nresigned: what diseases had been encountered when one man quit; how much\njungle had been cleared before another did.\n\nFiles came and went in a continuous flux; coffee and sandwiches came and\ngrew cold and stale. The air became gray with smoke.\n\nNothing.\n\nThe same results had come out of every investigation: You needed a man\nwho was unstable to get him to leave Earth. You needed a man who was\nstable to have him stay on Venus. You needed initiative and\nresourcefulness to survive on a new planet. You needed a man who had so\nlittle initiative and resourcefulness that the competition on Earth\nwouldn't be profitable. You needed a young, healthy, vigorous specimen.\nYou needed an older, experienced, more mature person.\n\nYou needed A and you needed non-A.\n\nAnd even if you found people with the factors balanced just right,\nassuming you knew what the balance should be, where did you find five\nhundred of them?\n\nThe discussion went on. The solutions got wilder and more absurd. Take\nwhole orphan asylums and bring them up on Venus under military guard.\nBuild a development in the steamiest, nastiest jungle, and test recruits\nfor the colony there. Send African natives.\n\nThe men were beginning to make the whole thing look impossible again, so\nRod decided to call a halt until they could get a better perspective.\nTired himself, he dismissed them. They left quietly, not arguing in\nlittle groups or mumbling half-formed ideas to themselves, the way a\nteam that has been progressing will do.\n\n\n\nOnly Jaimie stayed. He remained sitting hunched up near the desk, in the\nsame position he'd held for the last hour. When the others had all left,\nhe grinned at Rod.\n\n\"You know, for a group of practicing psychologists, this is the softest\nbunch of suckers I've seen.\"\n\n\"You've proved that to your own profit several times so far,\" Rod\nanswered, rubbing his face as though smoothing the wrinkles could remove\nthe tension. \"Who have you robbed lately?\"\n\n\"I'm talking about your performance just now. Here comes the whole crew,\nwalking in with their heads hanging to the floor. Every last man was\nready to tell you he was quitting--that the problem was insoluble. And\nbefore anyone can say a word, you tell them that the whole thing is\nimpossible and imply that _you_ want to quit. Even Biddington fell for\nit. You can't back out now, Rod, they say. Let's not have defeatist talk\nout of you, of all people--\"\n\n\"I did feel that way,\" Rod said. \"I'm just about ready to quit. I think\nthat whatever our mistake has been, we can't do any better than we have.\nWe just don't know enough.\"\n\nJaimie wasn't grinning now. \"What will happen if you quit?\"\n\n\"My guess is that Carlson will set up a military outpost there. Make a\nclearing, build a fort, maybe a town. Then he'll try to get people to\ncome and live in it.\" Rod sighed. \"It won't work. They'll want to know\nwhy the planet had to be colonized that way--why wouldn't the _first_\ncolonists stay?\"\n\n\"I agree. The military outpost is a fine method for spreading a culture\nto an existing civilization. Rome did much for Europe that way; the most\npowerful cities sprang up near the Roman forts and roads. But as a\nmethod for inducing the populace to a new place, it doesn't work. A free\npeople will not willingly move into a military township.\" Jaimie looked\nsharply at Rod. \"So what do you intend to do--run out and turn it all\nover to Carlson?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Jaimie. I just don't know. Six years is a long time.\"\n\n\"Damn it, Rod, you had much worse jobs than this one in industry! How\ndid you select a computer man, a communications man, an engineering\nphysicist, out of a group of men with similar backgrounds? It seems to\nme a harder problem than this.\"\n\n\"We don't really know much, as I said,\" Rod said. \"Ours has often been\nan imitation science. When we had to select a computer man, we just gave\na battery of tests to successful computer men--structural vision,\nvocabulary, tri-dimensional memory, ink-blots, syllogisms, practically\neverything. Then we weeded out the tests whose scores appeared to have\nno statistical relevance. Any future computer man had to duplicate those\nresults, whatever they were. If we had a recently pioneered civilization\naround, Jaimie, you'd find this whole staff running through it like\npollsters before an election.\"\n\n\"What was all this talk about balance, instability, initiative and all\nthe rest?\" asked Jamie.\n\n\"That's what we do when we don't know, Jaimie. We try to predict what we\nneed; then we try to find ways of finding it in people.\"\n\n\n\nJaimie made an explosive sound. \"But I thought you _must_ have\nprogressed from empirical methods! I would have said something long ago,\nif I hadn't thought you knew what you were doing all the time!\" The\nhistorian was on his feet, stalking about the room. \"Why didn't you tell\nme about this before?\"\n\n\"Why? What difference would it have made?\" Rod frowned, failing to\nunderstand the other's excitement. \"Sure, we've progressed from the\nolder methods, in that we now have pretty complete data for all present\njob descriptions. And we can synthesize data for a new job, if it's not\ntoo different. But there isn't any information on the kind of person\nneeded in a new world. What the devil are you getting so upset about?\"\n\nThe historian threw himself into a chair and glared at Rod. \"If you\ncouldn't find the kind of people you needed to test, you could have\nasked a historian if he knew anything about them!\"\n\nRod shook his head puzzledly. \"Subjective data, such as that--\"\n\n\"Don't bring subjectivity into this, damn it! We get enough of that from\nphysical scientists.\" Jaimie held himself in the chair, almost shaking\nwith the intensity of his feeling. \"Look, Rod, you know I want to see\nthe project succeed. And you admit that you haven't got an answer. Well,\nbaby, I think I have! It's an idea that has about a fifty-fifty chance\nof being right in this case ... would you be willing to try it?\"\n\n\"If I had been betting on your side for the last few months, I'd be\nseveral dollars richer,\" Rod smiled. \"Yes, I think I might go along with\nyour idea, if you can convince me it has an even chance for success.\nThree failures out of three tries makes for poorer odds than that. What\ndo you have in mind?\"\n\n\"H'm,\" Jaimie said. \"I imagine your stock isn't so high with old\nscabbard and blade right now, is it?\"\n\nRod laughed. \"I don't think he'll shoot on sight, but I'm not positive\nenough to stand in front of a lighted window.\"\n\n\"Well, then--if I had an idea you agreed with, the surest way to kill it\nwould be to have you present it to him, right? And if you _fight_ it,\nthat's sure to convince Carlson!\" Jaimie thought hard for a moment,\ntapping the chair-arm. \"Rod, I have to do something you aren't going to\nlike. Do you trust me?\"\n\n\"You mean you're going to try this without even discussing it with the\npersonnel group?\"\n\n\"That's right. If I don't tell you what I'm doing, I know you'll fight\nit. And I'll need that kind of help from you to push Carlson into doing\nit.\n\n\"But I have to do something far worse than that, Rod. I'm going to tell\nthe general that you knew my plan from the start, and have been sitting\non it because I'm not a psychologist. I'm going to ruin your reputation\nwith the worst set of lies since the Red purges. I'll say you're\nfighting me, because you can't accept an idea that came from a man\noutside of your own group. If the scheme doesn't work you'll be ruined,\nbecause there'll be no way to retract the lies. If it does work, we can\nannounce that we put on an act to sell the plan to Carlson. Can you take\nit?\"\n\nRod was thoughtful for a few minutes. He liked and trusted Jaimie, but\nthe man had no experience in this field--and this sounded like an\nall-or-nothing shot.\n\nThen he remembered his despair over the latest set of resignations. He'd\nbeen ready to quit--he had nothing to offer, and neither did his men.\nEven a wild idea was worth a try, he thought grimly--he would be risking\nnothing but a plan that had already failed.\n\n\"Go to it, boy,\" he said. \"And if you need a fight, you'll get a damn\ngood one.\"\n\n\n\nThe fight with Carlson was short, and Rod was abruptly overruled. After\nthat Jaimie moved fast. The new colonists flocked in. Three months after\nRod's talk with him, the compounds started to fill. A shipload was a\nhundred men, and each new man had to wait in a group until it was\nfilled. But there was no waiting now except for processing; the\ncompounds were full before the ships were ready.\n\nRod had paid no attention to Jaimie's recruiting methods, thinking that\nthe historian's idea differed mainly in control over the colonists.\n\nUntil he saw the crowds.\n\nEven from a distance, they didn't have the young look of the previous\ngroups. Up close, they looked like the sweepings of the slums.\n\nHe and Biddington talked to a few before they fully realized what Jaimie\nhad done. All the men were sure that Venus was a mineral paradise--gold\nin the streams, uranium lodes so pure you had to wear a shield to get\nnear them, diamonds, silver--every treasure that had ever excited men on\nEarth was scattered around the new world waiting to be picked up. That\nwas what Jaimie had told them.\n\nRod got to a phone, fast.\n\n\"Jaimie, you fool! I know what you're doing, and I won't put up with it!\nYou've told these dupes they can get rich on Venus! You intended to\nattract large numbers of recruits, in the hope that some of them will be\nwhat we need--but look at what you attracted! Crooks, gangsters, bums,\nhoboes, sharecroppers and I don't know what. You got recruits all\nright ... but what the hell kind of a society are you going to start\nwith them! And who will go and live there among them later?\"\n\n\"What's the matter, Workham?\" Jaimie asked coldly. \"Are you a racial\npurist? Want only your kind of people to get to Venus?\"\n\n\"I don't care _who_ goes, as long as they fit some standards. But to\nmake a decent place, you need decent people--morally clean and healthy.\nNot this collection of mental cripples, alcoholics and thieves. Probably\nhalf of them are wanted men!\"\n\nHe argued further, unable to believe that this was Jaimison's great\nfifty-fifty chance. He said many things ... and regretted every one; for\nthat night the telecasts carried a recorded version of his outburst.\nJaimie had maneuvered him into saying things he didn't quite mean, so\nthat it looked as if he was trying to hide the all good things on Venus\nand save them for his own friends. One commentator said outright that if\nyou weren't a college graduate recommended by one of Workham's friends,\nit would cost you a thousand dollars to get on an outgoing ship. By the\nnext morning, half the papers in the world were after Workham's scalp.\n\n\n\nRod could only take the abuse and grind his teeth. How did you fight a\nthing like that? You were condemned if you kept silent, and if you\nanswered, people nodded their heads and said, \"See--he's still trying to\ndeny it.\"\n\nThe failures from the old colonies were Rod's only allies. They tried to\ntell people what Venus was like, and what lies Carlson and his stooge\nJaimison were using for bait. But it was pointed out that these men\nnaturally had a stake in the secret ... and, after all, everyone knew\nhow well off the returning colonists were! This was actually due to the\nhigh premium paid to get men to go to the planet, but no one believed.\n\nDays passed. Weeks. The compounds filled, and emptied, and filled again.\nPeople stood in lines to apply. They walked miles to appear at a\nrecruiting center. They fought for a place on the next ship, or the one\nafter that. Farmers, clerks, ragged families, hoboes, armed men,\nteen-age boys and old men. Four thousand people applied in the first few\nmonths and were shipped out. Then the crowds thinned, even though the\nGet Rich propaganda continued. Soon, only a few hundred appeared where\nthere had been thousands; then twos and threes; at last only a dozen or\nso a day, many of whom changed their minds before the full shipload had\nbeen assembled.\n\nRod clung to his job throughout. He had little to do, though his\ndepartment had never been formally discontinued. Sooner or later, he\nknew, their services would be needed--when this cheap trick had failed.\nSo he and his staff remained. Studying old files, making up test\nbatteries, discussing survival factors, they readied themselves for the\nproject again. From time to time they interviewed and tested a few of\nthose waiting in the compounds. There was too much time to just sit\naround--even this activity was a welcome diversion.\n\nAs the year passed, the number of prospective colonists stopped\ndecreasing and held steady at about five a day. But slowly something\nelse changed. Among the new arrivals there began to appear engineers who\nhad tossed up good jobs to emigrate, farmers with their families,\nschool-teachers, storekeepers, lawyers, even doctors. All of them young.\nNot in any great number; but their appearance was a surprise still. Then\nthere came two former colonists who had resigned on one of the earlier\nattempts, now trying to get back to Venus without inducement of bonus,\nhigh pay or guaranteed return.\n\nThat was the day Rod decided to call on Jaimie.\n\n\n\n\"I have here a bottle of eight-year-old rye, Jaimie,\" he began. \"I think\nyou're entitled to a drink, and I'm entitled to an explanation. Want to\nswap?\"\n\n\"Rod!\" Jaimie's bony face lit up. \"It's good to see you. I've been\nafraid to call you until we could admit to the hoax. Come in, come in.\"\n\n\"Well, you did it,\" Rod said, after they had settled down. \"I met two\nformer colonists in the compound today. They know there isn't gold on\nVenus, and still they want to go out for free. No contract. And lately\nwe've been getting professional people. There was even a kid fresh out\nof journalism school who wants to start up a paper. Jaimie, how did you\ndo it? Were we so far wrong as that?\"\n\n\"You did it yourself, Rod. You told me how--but you wouldn't have\nbelieved, then. Or if you had, we never would have sold it to Carlson.\nRemember, you said if there were only a recent pioneer civilization\naround, you'd run to them with ink-blots and vocabulary tests? All you\nneeded to do was duplicate the kind of person who settled America or\nAustralia or California.\n\n\"Well, as a historian I _knew_ those people. And I knew what brought\nthem. So I merely put out the same kind of bait.\"\n\n\"The same kind of bait!\" Rod exclaimed. \"What about freedom of religion\nand freedom from oppression? Isn't that what brought people to this\ncountry? There's no oppression to flee from these days! And even if it\nwas the same bait, why weren't the same kind of people attracted? You\nsaw that first compound full--where in that cesspool was Thomas Paine,\nor Franklin, or Miles Standish?\"\n\n\"Franklin was born here,\" Jaimie grinned. \"Paine didn't come over in the\nfirst wave. And I suppose General Carlson was Miles Standish. Maybe that\nkid journalist you saw was Paine's counterpart. No, Rod--the bait I held\nout attracted the same kind of people initially as it always has. You\nhave been compromising all along on the factors you really wanted in\norder to get young, healthy, moral people to Venus. The answer is simply\nthis: Pioneers are not necessarily young, healthy, or moral. So you\ndidn't get what you wanted.\n\n\"You see, America wasn't only founded by pilgrims. They were actually a\nminority here. We were settled by promoters, trappers, bonded servants,\nexiled British deportees, pickpockets and thieves. We were explored by\nFrench and Spanish pirates. The better element in Europe didn't come\nhere at first--why should they? It was dangerous. Pioneering was to the\nadvantage of the worst elements. They came by court order, out of\nnecessity, for adventure. They came for gold more than for freedom; for\na new chance more than for a new religion.\n\n\"Australia was set up as a penal colony. Others went there for gold, or\nto start over where they weren't known. That's the kind of person who\nsettles a new land--the misfits: too impulsive, drunkards, weaklings,\nconvicts, and fugitives from justice. Too sick in mind and body to make\na go of it where they are.\n\n\"So we announced that there was a brand new world with a new chance for\neveryone on it. We implied that there was wealth. We told them\neverything about Venus that brought the English to America, the Spanish\nto South America, the Easterners to the West, and the Middlewesterners\nto California. We didn't hunt for pioneers. They came to us.\"\n\n\n\nRod refilled his glass thoughtfully. \"But what kind of a society will\nmen like that create? A fighting, lawless structure....\"\n\n\"That's right. And the lawless will eliminate themselves by their very\nactivities. Like the early West. While the doctors come in to treat\nwounds, and the lawyers to plead their cases; while their wives and the\nother wives will start schools and bring in school-teachers. That\nsociety will purge itself, Rod--many of the worst will become good\ncitizens out of meeting the challenge of a new planet, and the rest will\ndisappear.\"\n\n\"Well, then, what about the gold story?\" Rod asked. \"Won't they be angry\nwith everyone connected with the project because of the hoax?\"\n\n\"That was a little raw, but no worse than other gold rushes--few of the\nstampeders ever found the gold they went after. The captain of one of\nthe rockets told me that the first few months the colonists were trying\nto stow away on the returning ships. Now they send messages to friends\nand relatives to come before the opportunity is gone--that's why you've\nseen this better element. Our lies will soon be forgotten, and crops and\nfoods and minerals will be coming from Venus, and better people will go\nto meet the diminished challenge on our brave new world.\"\n\nRod stood up. \"Well, my compliments for a job well done, Jaimie. When do\nyou expect to go and live there yourself? You'll have to soon, won't\nyou, to complete the Project Record in residence?\"\n\nJaimie nodded. \"About six months from now, I think. Why?\"\n\n\"Good,\" Rod exclaimed. \"We can all go together.\"\n\n\"What are you planning to do? Volunteer?\"\n\n\"The whole personnel staff will be going. Here's just what we need--a\nyoung pioneer society! We can get adequate data for future selection, a\nbetter idea of what kind of person a colony needs at different stages of\ngrowth.\" Rod grinned. \"After all, your method was pretty sloppy, even if\nit did work. And you sent far too many wrong people. Once we have some\ngood data ... anything you can do, we can do better!\"",
