    "body": "They saw Tam's shabby clothing and the small, weather-beaten bag he\ncarried, and they ordered him aside from the flow of passengers, and\nchecked his packet of passports and visas with extreme care. Then they\nordered him to wait. Tam waited, a chilly apprehension rising in his\nthroat. For fifteen minutes he watched them, helplessly.\n\nFinally, the Spaceport was empty, and the huge liner from the outer\nAsteroid Rings was being lifted and rolled by the giant hooks and\ncranes back into its berth for drydock and repair, her curved,\nmeteor-dented hull gleaming dully in the harsh arc lights. Tam watched\nthe creaking cranes, and shivered in the cold night air, feeling\nhunger and dread gnawing at his stomach. There was none of the elation\nleft, none of the great, expansive, soothing joy at returning to Earth\nafter eight long years of hard work and bitterness. Only the cold,\ncorroding uncertainty, the growing apprehension. Times had changed\nsince that night back in '87--just how much he hardly dared to guess.\nAll he knew was the rumors he had heard, the whispered tales, the\nfrightened eyes and the scarred backs and faces. Tam hadn't believed\nthem then, so remote from Earth. He had just laughed and told himself\nthat the stories weren't true. And now they all welled back into his\nmind, tightening his throat and making him tremble--\n\n\"Hey, Sharkie. Come here.\"\n\nTam turned and walked slowly over to the customs official who held his\npapers. \"Everything's in order,\" he said, half defiantly, looking up\nat the officer's impassive face. \"There isn't any mistake.\"\n\n\"What were you doing in the Rings, Sharkie?\" The officer's voice was\nsharp.\n\n\"Indenture. Working off my fare back home.\"\n\nThe officer peered into Tam's face, incredulously. \"And you come back\nhere?\" He shook his head and turned to the other officer. \"I knew\nthese Sharkies were dumb, but I didn't think they were that dumb.\" He\nturned back to Tam, his eyes suspicious. \"What do you think you're\ngoing to do now?\"\n\nTam shrugged, uneasily. \"Get a job,\" he said. \"A man's got to eat.\"\n\nThe officers exchanged glances. \"How long you been on the Rings?\"\n\n\"Eight years.\" Tam looked up at him, anxiously. \"Can I have my papers\nnow?\"\n\nA cruel grin played over the officer's lips. \"Sure,\" he said, handing\nback the packet of papers. \"Happy job-hunting,\" he added sardonically.\n\"But remember--the ship's going back to the Rings in a week. You can\nalways sign yourself over for fare--\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Tam, turning away sharply. \"I know all about how that\nworks.\" He tucked the papers carefully into a tattered breast pocket,\nhefted the bag wearily, and began trudging slowly across the cold\nconcrete of the Port toward the street and the Underground. A wave of\nloneliness, almost overpowering in intensity, swept over him, a\nfeeling of emptiness, bleak and hopeless. A chilly night wind swept\nthrough his unkempt blond hair as the automatics let him out into the\nstreet, and he saw the large dirty \"New Denver Underground\" sign with\nthe arrow at the far side of the road. Off to the right, several miles\nacross the high mountain plateau, the great capitol city loomed up,\nshining like a thousand twinkling stars in the clear cold air. Tam\njingled his last few coins listlessly, and started for the downward\nramp. Somewhere, down there, he could find a darkened corner, maybe\neven a bench, where the police wouldn't bother him for a couple of\nhours. Maybe after a little sleep, he'd find some courage, hidden away\nsomewhere. Just enough to walk into an office and ask for a job.\n\nThat, he reflected wearily as he shuffled into the tunnel, would take\na lot of courage--\n\n\n\nThe girl at the desk glanced up at him, indifferent, and turned her\neyes back to the letter she was typing. Tam Peters continued to stand,\nawkwardly, his blond hair rumpled, little crow's-feet of weariness\ncreeping from the corners of his eyes. Slowly he looked around the\nneat office, feeling a pang of shame at his shabby clothes. He should\nat least have found some way to shave, he thought, some way to take\nsome of the rumple from his trouser legs. He looked back at the\nreceptionist, and coughed, lightly.\n\nShe finished her letter at a leisurely pace, and finally looked up at\nhim, her eyes cold. \"Well?\"\n\n\"I read your ad. I'm looking for a job. I'd like to speak to Mr.\nRandall.\"\n\nThe girl's eyes narrowed, and she took him in in a rapid, sweeping\nglance, his high, pale forehead, the shock of mud-blond hair, the\nthin, sensitive face with the exaggerated lines of approaching middle\nage, the slightly misty blue eyes. It seemed to Tam that she stared\nfor a full minute, and he shifted uneasily, trying to meet the cold\ninspection, and failing, finally settling his eyes on her prim, neatly\nmanicured fingers. Her lip curled very slightly. \"Mr. Randall can't\nsee you today. He's busy. Try again tomorrow.\" She turned back to\ntyping.\n\nA flat wave of defeat sprang up in his chest. \"The ad said to apply\ntoday. The earlier the better.\"\n\nShe sniffed indifferently, and pulled a long white sheet from the\ndesk. \"Have you filled out an application?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You can't see Mr. Randall without filling out an application.\" She\npointed to a small table across the room, and he felt her eyes on his\nback as he shuffled over and sat down.\n\nHe began filling out the application with great care, making the\nprinting as neat as he could with the old-style vacuum pen provided.\nName, age, sex, race, nationality, planet where born, pre-Revolt\nexperience, post-Revolt experience, preference--try as he would, Tam\ncouldn't keep the ancient pen from leaking, making an unsightly blot\nnear the center of the form. Finally he finished, and handed the paper\nback to the girl at the desk. Then he sat back and waited.\n\nAnother man came in, filled out a form, and waited, too, shooting Tam\na black look across the room. In a few moments the girl turned to the\nman. \"Robert Stover?\"\n\n\"Yuh,\" said the man, lumbering to his feet. \"That's me.\"\n\n\"Mr. Randall will see you now.\"\n\nThe man walked heavily across the room, disappeared into the back\noffice. Tam eyed the clock uneasily, still waiting.\n\nA garish picture on the wall caught his eyes, a large, very poor oil\nportrait of a very stout, graying man dressed in a ridiculous green\nsuit with a little white turban-like affair on the top of his head.\nUnderneath was a little brass plaque with words Tam could barely make\nout:\n\n             Abraham L. Ferrel\n\n              (1947-1986)\n\n       Founder and First President\n       Marsport Mines, Incorporated\n\n       \"Unto such men as these,\n        we look to leadership.\"\n\nTam stared at the picture, his lip curling slightly. He glanced\nanxiously at the clock as another man was admitted to the small back\noffice.\n\nThen another man. Anger began creeping into Tam's face, and he fought\nto keep the scowl away, to keep from showing his concern. The hands of\nthe clock crept around, then around again. It was almost noon. Not a\nvery new dodge, Tam thought coldly. Not very new at all. Finally the\nsmall cold flame of anger got the better of him, and he rose and\nwalked over to the desk. \"I'm still here,\" he said patiently. \"I'd\nlike to see Mr. Randall.\"\n\nThe girl stared at him indignantly, and flipped an intercom switch.\n\"That Peters application is still out here,\" she said brittlely. \"Do\nyou want to see him, or not?\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence. Then the voice on the intercom grated,\n\"Yes, I guess so. Send him in.\"\n\nThe office was smaller, immaculately neat. Two visiphone units hung on\na switchboard at the man's elbow. Tam's eyes caught the familiar\nequipment, recognized the interplanetary power coils on one. Then he\nturned his eyes to the man behind the desk.\n\n\"Now, then, what are you after?\" asked the man, settling his bulk down\nbehind the desk, his eyes guarded, revealing a trace of boredom.\n\n\n\nTam was suddenly bitterly ashamed of his shabby appearance, the\ntwo-day stubble on his chin. He felt a dampness on his forehead, and\ntried to muster some of the old power and determination into his\nvoice. \"I need a job,\" he said. \"I've had plenty of experience with\nradio-electronics and remote control power operations. I'd make a good\nmine-operator--\"\n\n\"I can read,\" the man cut in sharply, gesturing toward the application\nform with the ink blot in the middle. \"I read all about your\nexperience. But I can't use you. There aren't any more openings.\"\n\nTam's ears went red. \"But you're always advertising,\" he countered.\n\"You don't have to worry about me working on Mars, either--I've worked\non Mars before, and I can work six, seven hours, even, without a mask\nor equipment--\"\n\nThe man's eyebrows raised slightly. \"How very interesting,\" he said\nflatly. \"The fact remains that there aren't any jobs open for you.\"\n\nThe cold, angry flame flared up in Tam's throat suddenly, forcing out\nthe sense of futility and defeat. \"Those other men,\" he said sharply.\n\"I was here before them. That girl wouldn't let me in--\"\n\nRandall's eyes narrowed amusedly. \"What a pity,\" he said sadly. \"And\njust think, I hired every one of them--\" His face suddenly hardened,\nand he sat forward, his eyes glinting coldly. \"Get smart, Peters. I\nthink Marsport Mines can somehow manage without you. You or any other\nSharkie. The men just don't like to work with Sharkies.\"\n\nRage swelled up in Tam's chest, bitter futile rage, beating at his\ntemples and driving away all thought of caution. \"Look,\" he grated,\nbending over the desk threateningly. \"I know the law of this system.\nThere's a fair-employment act on the books. It says that men are to be\nhired by any company in order of application when they qualify equally\nin experience. I can prove my experience--\"\n\nRandall stood up, his face twisted contemptuously. \"Get out of here,\"\nhe snarled. \"You've got nerve, you have, come crawling in here with\nyour law! Where do you think you are?\" His voice grated in the still\nair of the office. \"We don't hire Sharkies, law or no law, get that?\nNow get out of here!\"\n\nTam turned, his ears burning, and strode through the office, blindly,\nkicking open the door and almost running to the quiet air of the\nstreet outside. The girl at the desk yawned, and snickered, and went\nback to her typing with an unpleasant grin.\n\nTam walked the street, block after block, seething, futile rage\nswelling up and bubbling over, curses rising to his lips, clipped off\nwith some last vestige of self-control. At last he turned into a small\ndowntown bar and sank wearily onto a stool near the door. The anger\nwas wearing down now to a sort of empty, hopeless weariness, dulling\nhis senses, exaggerating the hunger in his stomach. He had expected\nit, he told himself, he had known what the answer would be--but he\nknew that he had hoped, against hope, against what he had known to be\nthe facts; hoped desperately that maybe someone would listen. Oh, he\nknew the laws, all right, but he'd had plenty of time to see the\ncourts in action. Unfair employment was almost impossible to make\nstick under any circumstances, but with the courts rigged the way they\nwere these days--he sighed, and drew out one of his last credit-coins.\n\"Beer,\" he muttered as the barkeep looked up.\n\nThe bartender scowled, his heavy-set face a picture of fashionable\ndistaste. Carefully he filled every other order at the bar. Then he\ngrudgingly set up a small beer, mostly foam, and flung some small-coin\nchange down on the bar before Tam. Tam stared at the glass, the little\nproud flame of anger flaring slowly.\n\nA fat man, sitting nearby, stared at him for a long moment, then took\na long swill of beer from his glass. \"'Smatter, Sharkie? Whyncha drink\ny'r beer 'n get t' hell out o' here?\"\n\nTam stared fixedly at his glass, giving no indication of having heard\na word.\n\nThe fat man stiffened a trifle, swung around to face him. \"God-dam\nSharkie's too good to talk to a guy,\" he snarled loudly.\n\"Whassa-matter, Sharkie, ya deaf?\"\n\nTarn's hand trembled as he reached for the beer, took a short swallow.\nShrugging, he set the glass on the bar and got up from his stool. He\nwalked out, feeling many eyes on his back.\n\nHe walked. Time became a blur to a mind beaten down by constant\nrebuff. He became conscious of great weariness of both mind and body.\nInstinct screamed for rest....\n\n\n\nTam sat up, shaking his head to clear it. He shivered from the chill\nof the park--the cruel pressure of the bench. He pulled up his collar\nand moved out into the street again.\n\nThere was one last chance. Cautiously his mind skirted the idea,\npicked it up, regarded it warily, then threw it down again. He had\npromised himself never to consider it, years before, in the hot, angry\ndays of the Revolt. Even then he had had some inkling of the shape of\nthings, and he had promised himself, bitterly, never to consider that\nlast possibility. Still--\n\nAnother night in the cold out-of-doors could kill him. Suddenly he\ndidn't care any more, didn't care about promises, or pride, or\nanything else. He turned into a public telephone booth, checked an\naddress in the thick New Denver book--\n\nHe knew he looked frightful as he stepped onto the elevator, felt the\ncold eyes turn away from him in distaste. Once he might have been\nmortified, felt the deep shame creeping up his face, but he didn't\ncare any longer. He just stared ahead at the moving panel, avoiding\nthe cold eyes, until the fifth floor was called.\n\nThe office was halfway down the dark hallway. He saw the sign on the\ndoor, dimly: \"United Continents Bureau of Employment\", and down in\nsmall letters below, \"Planetary Division, David G. Hawke.\"\n\nTarn felt the sinking feeling in his stomach, and opened the door\napprehensively. It had been years since he had seen Dave, long years\nfilled with violence and change. Those years could change men, too.\nTam thought, fearfully; they could make even the greatest men change.\nHe remembered, briefly, his promise to himself, made just after the\nRevolt, never to trade on past friendships, never to ask favors of\nthose men he had known before, and befriended. With a wave of warmth,\nthe memory of those old days broke through, those days when he had\nroomed with Dave Hawke, the long, probing talks, the confidences, the\ndeep, rich knowledge that they had shared each others dreams and\nideals, that they had stood side by side for a common cause, though\nthey were such different men, from such very different worlds. Ideals\nhad been cheap in those days, talk easy, but still, Tam knew that Dave\nhad been sincere, a firm, stout friend. He had known, then, the\nsincerity in the big lad's quiet voice, felt the rebellious fire in\nhis eyes. They had understood each other, then, deeply,\nsympathetically, in spite of the powerful barrier they sought to tear\ndown--\n\nThe girl at the desk caught his eye, looked up from her work without\nsmiling. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"My name is Tam Peters. I'd like to see Mr. Hawke.\" His voice was\nthin, reluctant, reflecting overtones of the icy chill in his chest.\nSo much had happened since those long-dead days, so many things to\nmake men change--\n\nThe girl was grinning, her face like a harsh mask. \"You're wasting\nyour time,\" she said, her voice brittle.\n\nAnger flooded Tarn's face. \"Listen,\" he hissed. \"I didn't ask for your\nadvice. I asked to see Dave Hawke. If you choose to announce me now,\nthat's fine. If you don't see fit, then I'll go in without it. And you\nwon't stop me--\"\n\nThe girl stiffened, her eyes angry. \"You'd better not get smart,\" she\nsnapped, watching him warily. \"There are police in the building. You'd\nbetter not try anything, or I'll call them!\"\n\n\"That's enough Miss Jackson.\"\n\nThe girl turned to the man in the office door, her eyes disdainful.\n\nThe man stood in the doorway, a giant, with curly black hair above a\nhigh, intelligent forehead, dark brooding eyes gleaming like live\ncoals in the sensitive face. Tam looked at him, and suddenly his knees\nwould hardly support him, and his voice was a tight whisper--\n\n\"Dave!\"\n\nAnd then the huge man was gripping his hand, a strong arm around his\nthin shoulders, the dark, brooding eyes soft and smiling. \"Tam,\nTam--It's been so damned long, man--oh, it's good to see you, Tam.\nWhy, the last I heard, you'd taken passage to the Rings--years ago--\"\n\nWeakly, Tam stumbled into the inner office, sank into a chair, his\neyes overflowing, his mind a turmoil of joy and relief. The huge man\nslammed the door to the outer office and settled down behind the desk,\nsticking his feet over the edge, beaming. \"Where have you _been_, Tam?\nYou promised you'd look me up any time you came to New Denver, and I\nhaven't seen you in a dozen years--\" He fished in a lower drawer.\n\"Drink?\"\n\n\"No, no--thanks. I don't think I could handle a drink--\" Tam sat back,\ngazing at the huge man, his throat tight. \"You look bigger and better\nthan ever, Dave.\"\n\n\n\nDave Hawke laughed, a deep bass laugh that seemed to start at the\nsoles of his feet. \"Couldn't very well look thin and wan,\" he said. He\npushed a cigar box across the desk. \"Here, light up. I'm on these\nexclusively these days--remember how you tried to get me to smoke\nthem, back at the University? How you couldn't stand cigarettes? Said\nthey were for women, a man should smoke a good cigar. You finally\nconverted me.\"\n\nTam grinned, suddenly feeling the warmth of the old friendship\nswelling Back. \"Yes, I remember. You were smoking that rotten corncob,\nthen, because old Prof Tenley smoked one that you could smell in the\nback of the room, and in those days the Prof could do no wrong--\"\n\nDave Hawke grinned broadly, settled back in his chair as he lit the\ncigar. \"Yes, I remember. Still got that corncob around somewhere--\" he\nshook his head, his eyes dreamy. \"Good old Prof Tenley! One in a\nmillion--there was an honest man, Tam. They don't have them like that\nin the colleges these days. Wonder what happened to the old goat?\"\n\n\"He was killed,\" said Tam, softly. \"Just after the war. Got caught in\na Revolt riot, and he was shot down.\"\n\nDave looked at him, his eyes suddenly sad. \"A lot of honest men went\ndown in those riots, didn't they? That was the worst part of the\nRevolt. There wasn't any provision made for the honest men, the really\ngood men.\" He stopped, and regarded Tam closely. \"What's the trouble,\nTam? If you'd been going to make a friendly call, you'd have done it\nyears ago. You know this office has always been open to you--\"\n\nTam stared at his shoe, carefully choosing his words, lining them up\nin his mind, a frown creasing his forehead. \"I'll lay it on the line,\"\nhe said in a low voice. \"I'm in a spot. That passage to the Rings\nwasn't voluntary. I was shanghaied onto a freighter, and had to work\nfor eight years without pay to get passage back. I'm broke, and I'm\nhungry, and I need to see a doctor--\"\n\n\"Well, hell!\" the big man exploded. \"Why didn't you holler sooner?\nLook, Tam--we've been friends for a long time. You know better than to\nhesitate.\" He fished for his wallet. \"Here, I can let you have as much\nas you need--couple hundred?\"\n\n\"No, no--That's not what I'm getting at.\" Tam felt his face flush with\nembarrassment. \"I need a job, Dave. I need one bad.\"\n\nDave sat back, and his feet came off the desk abruptly. He didn't look\nat Tam. \"I see,\" he said softly. \"A job--\" He stared at the ceiling\nfor a moment. \"Tell you what,\" he said. \"The government's opening a\nnew uranium mine in a month or so--going to be a big project, they'll\nneed lots of men--on Mercury--\"\n\nTam's eyes fell, a lump growing in his throat. \"Mercury,\" he repeated\ndully.\n\n\"Why, sure, Tam--good pay, chance for promotion.\"\n\n\"I'd be dead in six months on Mercury.\" Tam's eyes met Dave's, trying\nto conceal the pain. \"You know that as well as I do, Dave--\"\n\nDave looked away. \"Oh, the docs don't know what they're talking\nabout--\"\n\n\"You know perfectly well that they do. I couldn't even stand Venus\nvery long. I need a job on Mars, Dave--or on Earth.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dave Hawke sadly, \"I guess you're right.\" He looked\nstraight at Tam, his eyes sorrowful. \"The truth is, I can't help you.\nI'd like to, but I can't. There's nothing I can do.\"\n\nTam stared, the pain of disillusionment sweeping through him. \"Nothing\nyou can do!\" he exploded. \"But you're the _director_ of this bureau!\nYou know every job open on every one of the planets--\"\n\n\"I know. And I have to help get them filled. But I can't make anyone\nhire, Tam. I can send applicants, and recommendations, until I'm blue\nin the face, but I can't make a company hire--\" He paused, staring at\nTam. \"Oh, hell,\" he snarled, suddenly, his face darkening. \"Let's face\nit, Tam. They won't hire you. Nobody will hire you. You're a Sharkie,\nand that's all there is to it, they aren't hiring Sharkies. And\nthere's nothing I can do to make them.\"\n\nTam sat as if he had been struck, the color draining from his face.\n\"But the law--Dave, you know there's a law. They _have_ to hire us, if\nwe apply first, and have the necessary qualifications.\"\n\nThe big man shrugged, uneasily. \"Sure, there's a law, but who's going\nto enforce it?\"\n\nTam looked at him, a desperate tightness in his throat. \"_You_ could\nenforce it. You could if you wanted to.\"\n\n\n\nThe big man stared at him for a moment, then dropped his eyes, looked\ndown at the desk. Somehow this big body seemed smaller, less\nimpressive. \"I can't do it, Tam. I just can't.\"\n\n\"They'd have to listen to you!\" Tam's face was eager. \"You've got\nenough power to put it across--the court would _have_ to stick to the\nlaw--\"\n\n\"I can't do it.\" Dave drew nervously on his cigar, and the light in\nhis eyes seemed duller, now. \"If it were just me, I wouldn't hesitate\na minute. But I've got a wife, a family. I can't jeopardize them--\"\n\n\"Dave, you know it would be the right thing.\"\n\n\"Oh, the right thing be damned! I can't go out on a limb, I tell you.\nThere's nothing I can do. I can let you have money, Tam, as much as\nyou need--I could help you set up in business, maybe, or anything--but\nI can't stick my neck out like that.\"\n\nTam sat stiffly, coldness seeping down into his legs. Deep in his\nheart he had known that this was what he had dreaded, not the fear of\nrebuff, not the fear of being snubbed, unrecognized, turned out. That\nwould have been nothing, compared to this change in the honest,\nforthright, fearless Dave Hawke he had once known. \"What's happened,\nDave? Back in the old days you would have leaped at such a chance. I\nwould have--the shoe was on the other foot then. We talked, Dave,\ndon't you remember how we talked? We were friends, you can't forget\nthat. I _know_ you, I _know_ what you believe, what you think. How can\nyou let yourself down?\"\n\nDave Hawke's eyes avoided Tam's. \"Times have changed. Those were the\ngood old days, back when everybody was happy, almost. Everybody but me\nand a few others--at least, it looked that way to you. But those days\nare gone. They'll never come back. This is a reaction period, and the\nreaction is bitter. There isn't any place for fighters now, the world\nis just the way people want it, and nobody can change it. What do you\nexpect me to do?\" He stopped, his heavy face contorted, a line of\nperspiration on his forehead. \"I hate it,\" he said finally, \"but my\nhands are tied. I can't do anything. That's the way things are--\"\n\n\"But _why_?\" Tam Peters was standing, eyes blazing, staring down at\nthe big man behind the desk, the bitterness of long, weary years\ntearing into his voice, almost blinding him. \"_Why is that the way\nthings are?_ What have I done? Why do we have this mess, where a man\nisn't worth any more than the color of his skin--\"\n\nDave Hawke slammed his fist on the desk, and his voice roared out in\nthe close air of the office. \"Because it was coming!\" he bellowed.\n\"It's been coming and now it's here--and there's nothing on God's\nearth can be done about it!\"\n\nTam's jaw sagged, and he stared at the man behind the desk.\n\"Dave--think what you're saying, Dave--\"\n\n\"I know right well what I'm saying,\" Dave Hawke roared, his eyes\nburning bitterly. \"Oh, you have no idea how long I've thought, the\nfight I've had with myself, the sacrifices I've had to make. You\nweren't born like I was, you weren't raised on the wrong side of the\nfence--well, there was an old, old Christmas story that I used to\nread. Years ago, before they burned the Sharkie books. It was about an\nevil man who went through life cheating people, hating and hurting\npeople, and when he died, he found that every evil deed he had ever\ndone had become a link in a heavy iron chain, tied and shackled to his\nwaist. And he wore that chain he had built up, and he had to drag it,\nand drag it, from one eternity to the next--his name was Marley,\nremember?\"\n\n\"Dave, you're not making sense--\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, all kinds of sense. Because you Sharkies have a chain, too.\nYou started forging it around your ankles back in the classical Middle\nAges of Earth. Year by year you built it up, link by link, built it\nstronger, heavier. You could have stopped it any time you chose, but\nyou didn't ever think of that. You spread over the world, building up\nyour chain, assuming that things would always be just the way they\nwere, just the way you wanted them to be.\"\n\nThe big man stopped, breathing heavily, a sudden sadness creeping into\nhis eyes, his voice taking on a softer tone. \"You were such fools,\" he\nsaid softly. \"You waxed and grew strong, and clever, and confident,\nand the more power you had, the more you wanted. You fought wars, and\nthen bigger and better wars, until you couldn't be satisfied with\ngunpowder and TNT any longer. And finally you divided your world into\ntwo armed camps, and brought Fury out of her box, fought with the\npower of the atoms themselves, you clever Sharkies--and when the dust\nsettled, and cooled off, there weren't very many of you left. Lots of\nus--it was your war, remember--but not very many of you. Of course\nthere was a Revolt then, and all the boxed up, driven in hatred and\nbloodshed boiled up and over, and you Sharkies at long last got your\nchain tied right around your waists. You were a long, long time\nbuilding it, and now you can wear it--\"\n\n\n\nTam's face was chalky. \"Dave--there were some of us--you know there\nwere many of us that hated it as much as you did, before the Revolt.\nSome of us fought, some of us at least tried--\"\n\nThe big man nodded his head, bitterly. \"You thought you tried, sure.\nIt was the noble thing to do, the romantic thing, the _good_ thing to\ndo. But you didn't really believe it. I know--I thought there was some\nhope, back then, some chance to straighten things out without a\nRevolt. For a long time I thought that you, and those like you, really\nmeant all you were saying, I thought somehow we could find an equal\nfooting, an end to the hatred and bitterness. But there wasn't any\nend, and you never really thought there ever would be. That made it so\nsafe--it would never succeed, so when things were quiet it was a nice\nidea to toy around with, this equality for all, a noble project that\ncouldn't possibly succeed. But when things got hot, it was a different\nmatter.\" He stared at Tam, his dark eyes brooding. \"Oh, it wasn't just\nyou, Tam. You were my best friend, even though it was a hopeless,\nfutile friendship. You tried, you did the best you could, I know. But\nit _just wasn't true_, Tam. When it came to the pinch, to a real jam,\nyou would have been just like the rest, basically. It was built up in\nyou, drummed into you, until no amount of fighting could ever scour it\nout--\"\n\nDave Hawke stood up, walked over to the window, staring out across the\ngreat city. Tam watched him, the blood roaring in his ears, hardly\nable to believe what he had heard from the big man, fighting to keep\nhis mind from sinking into total confusion. Somewhere a voice deep\nwithin him seemed to be struggling through with confirmation, telling\nhim that Dave Hawke was right, that he never really _had_ believed.\nSuddenly Dave turned to him, his dark eyes intense. \"Look, Tam,\" he\nsaid, quickly, urgently. \"There are jobs you can get. Go to Mercury\nfor a while, work the mines--not long, just for a while, out there in\nthe sun--then you can come back--\"\n\nTam's ears burned, fierce anger suddenly bursting in his mind, a\nfeeling of loathing. \"Never,\" he snapped. \"I know what you mean. I\ndon't do things that way. That's a coward's way, and by God, I'm no\ncoward!\"\n\n\"But it would be so easy, Tam--\" Dave's eyes were pleading now.\n\"Please--\"\n\nTam's eyes glinted. \"No dice. I've got a better idea. There's one\nthing I can do. It's not very nice, but at least it's honest, and\nsquare. I'm hungry. There's one place where I can get food. Even\nSharkies get food there. And a bed to sleep in, and books to\nread--maybe even some Sharkie books, and maybe some paper to write\non--\" He stared at the big man, oddly, his pale eyes feverish. \"Yes,\nyes, there's one place I can go, and get plenty to eat, and get away\nfrom this eternal rottenness--\"\n\nDave looked up at him, his eyes suspicious. \"Where do you mean?\"\n\n\"Prison,\" said Tam Peters.\n\n\"Oh, now see here--let's not be ridiculous--\"\n\n\"Not so ridiculous,\" snapped Tam, his eyes brighter. \"I figured it all\nout, before I came up here. I knew what you were going to say. Sure,\ngo to Mercury, Tam, work in the mines a while--well, I can't do it\nthat way. And there's only one other answer.\"\n\n\"But, Tam--\"\n\n\"Oh, it wouldn't take much. You know how the courts handle Sharkies.\nJust a small offense, to get me a few years, then a couple of attempts\nto break out, and I'd be in for life. I'm a Sharkie, remember. People\ndon't waste time with us.\"\n\n\"Tam, you're talking nonsense. Good Lord, man, you'd have no freedom,\nno life--\"\n\n\"What freedom do I have now?\" Tam snarled, his voice growing wild.\n\"Freedom to starve? Freedom to crawl on my hands and knees for a\nlittle bit of food? I don't want that kind of freedom.\" His eyes grew\nshrewd, shifted slyly to Dave Hawke's broad face. \"Just a simple\ncharge,\" he said slowly. \"Like assault, for instance. Criminal\nassault--it has an ugly sound, doesn't it, Dave? That should give me\nten years--\" his fist clenched at his side. \"Yes, criminal assault is\njust what ought to do the trick--\"\n\nThe big man tried to dodge, but Tam was too quick. His fist caught\nDave in the chest, and Tam was on him like a fury, kicking,\nscratching, snarling, pounding. Dave choked and cried out, \"Tam, for\nGod's sake stop--\" A blow caught him in the mouth, choking off his\nwords as Tam fought, all the hate and bitterness of long weary years\ntranslated into scratching, swearing desperation. Dave pushed him off,\nlike a bear trying to disentangle a maddened dog from his fur, but Tam\nwas back at him, fighting harder. The door opened, and Miss Jackson's\nfrightened face appeared briefly, then vanished. Finally Dave lifted a\nheavy fist, drove it hard into Tam's stomach, then sadly lifted the\nchoking, gasping man to the floor.\n\nThe police came in, seconds later, clubs drawn, eyes wide. They\ndragged Tam out, one on each arm. Dave sank back, his eyes filling, a\nsickness growing in the pit of his stomach. In court, a Sharkie would\ndraw the maximum sentence, without leniency. Ten years in prison--Dave\nleaned forward, his face in his hands, tears running down his black\ncheeks, sobs shaking his broad, heavy shoulders. \"Why wouldn't he\nlisten? Why couldn't he have gone to Mercury? Only a few months, not\nlong enough to hurt him. Why couldn't he have gone, and worked out in\nthe sun, got that hot sun down on his hands and face--not for long,\njust for a little while. Two or three months, and he'd have been dark\nenough to pass--\"\n\nTHE END\n\n",
