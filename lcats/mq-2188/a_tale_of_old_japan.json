    "body": "_THE appearance of this poem in its present form is due chiefly to the\ndemand created for it by a vanished hand. It was set to music as a\ncantata by Coleridge Taylor, some years ago. He thought it his best\nwork. Hardly a week has passed since then without some performance of\nit, in some part of the world; and it may be said that the music he\nwrote for it has won the lasting affection of the thousands that have\nheard it. He was, in two works, the most vital and spontaneous musician\nof his time. The first was his youthful setting of Longfellow's\n'Hiawatha.' Then came many years of experiment with European subjects,\ndisappointment, and apparent failure. In the Eastern theme of 'A Tale of\nOld Japan' he found something which (as those who know his history will\nunderstand) enabled him to draw the bow across his own heart-strings,\nand, from the first note to the last, he gave in it the most pathetic,\nthe most haunting expression, to his own spirit. To me it was a most\nmoving fact that his great genius should have shown so scrupulous and\ninfinitely painstaking a regard for the words of the poem. He submitted\nto their \"narrow room,\" but in a way that suggests quite new\npossibilities in the wedding of music and verse. He preserved every\ncadence of every line, and yet he gave the freedom of music to the\nwhole, in a way that poets had ceased to think possible. It is therefore\nto his memory that I would dedicate the poem, all too poor a chrysalis\nas it must seem for those exquisite wings._\n\n\n\n\n                          A TALE OF OLD JAPAN\n\n\nYoichi Tenko, the painter,             [Sidenote: I]\n  Dwelt by the purple sea,\nPainting the peacock islands\n  Under his willow-tree:\nAlso in temples he painted\n  Dragons of old Japan,\nWith a child to look at the pictures--\n  Little O Kimi San.\n\nKimi, the child of his brother,\n  Bright as the moon in May.\nWhite as a lotus lily,\n  Pink as a plum-tree spray,\nLinking her soft arm round him\n  Sang to his heart for an hour,\nKissed him with ripples of laughter\n  And lips of the cherry flower.\n\nChild of the old pearl-fisher\n  Lost in his junk at sea,\nKimi was loved of Tenko\n  As his own child might be,\nYoichi Tenko the painter,\n  Wrinkled and grey and old,\nTeacher of many disciples\n  That paid for his dreams with gold.\n\n\nPeonies, peonies crowned the May!     [Sidenote: II]\nClad in blue and white array\n  Came Sawara to the school\nUnder the silvery willow-tree,\n  All to learn of Tenko!\nRiding on a milk-white mule,\n  Young and poor and proud was he,\nLissom as a cherry spray\n[Peonies, peonies crowned the day!]\nAnd he rode the golden way\n  To the school of Tenko.\n\nSwift to learn, beneath his hand\nSoon he watched his wonderland\n  Growing cloud by magic cloud,\nUnder the silvery willow-tree\n  In the school of Tenko:\nKimi watched him, young and proud,\n  Painting by the purple sea.\nLying on the golden sand\nWatched his golden wings expand!\n[None but Love will understand\n  All she hid from Tenko.]\n\nHe could paint her tree and flower\nSea and spray and wizard's tower,\n  With one stroke, now hard, now soft,\nUnder the silvery willow-tree\n  In the school of Tenko:\n\nHe could fling a bird aloft,\n  Splash a dragon in the sea,\nCrown a princess in her bower,\nWith one stroke of magic power;\nAnd she watched him hour by hour,\n  In the school of Tenko.\n\nYoichi Tenko, wondering, scanned\nAll the work of that young hand,\n  Gazed his kakemonos o'er\nUnder the silvery willow-tree\n  In the school of Tenko:\n\"I can teach you nothing more,\n  Thought, or craft, or mystery;\nLet your golden wings expand,\nThey will shadow half the land,\nAll the world's at your command,\nCome no more to Tenko.\"\n\nLying on the golden sand,\nKimi watched his wings expand:\nWept.--He could not understand\n  Why she wept, said Tenko.\n\n\nSo, in her blue kimono,              [Sidenote: III]\n  Pale as the sickle moon\nGlimmered thro' soft plum-branches\n  Blue in the dusk of June,\nStole she, willing and waning,\n  Frightened and unafraid,--\n\"Take me with you, Sawara,\n  Over the sea\", she said.\n\nSmall and sadly beseeching,\n  Under the willow-tree,\nGlimmered her face like a foam-flake\n  Drifting over the sea:\nPale as a drifting blossom,\n  Lifted her face to his eyes:\nSlowly he gathered and held her\n  Under the drifting skies.\n\nPoor little face cast backward\n  Better to see his own,\nEarth and heaven went past them\n  Drifting: they too, alone\nStood, immortal. He whispered--\n  \"Nothing can part us two!\"\nBackward her sad little face went\n  Drifting, and dreamed it true.\n\n\"Others are happy,\" she murmured,\n  \"Maidens and men I have seen;\nYou are my king, Sawara,\n  O, let me be your queen!\nIf I am all too lowly,\"\n  Sadly she strove to smile,\n\"Let me follow your footsteps,\n  Your slave for a little while.\"\n\nSurely, he thought, I have painted\n  Nothing so fair as this\nMoonlit almond blossom\n  Sweet to fold and kiss,\nBrow that is filled with music,\n  Shell of a faery sea,\nEyes like the holy violets\n  Brimmed with dew for me.\n\n\"Wait for Sawara\" he whispered,\n  Does not his whole heart yearn\nNow to his moon-bright maiden?\n  Wait, for he will return\nRich as the wave on the moon's path\n  Rushing to claim his bride!\"\nSo they plighted their promise,\n  And the ebbing sea-wave sighed.\n\n\nMoon and flower and butterfly,        [Sidenote: IV]\nEarth and heaven went drifting by,\n  Three long years while Kimi dreamed\nUnder the silvery willow-tree\n  In the school of Tenko,\nSteadfast while the whole world streamed\n  Past her tow'rds Eternity;\nSteadfast till with one great cry,\n  Ringing to the gods on high,\nGolden wings should bind the sky\n  And bring him back to Tenko.\n\nThree long years and nought to say\n\"Sweet, I come the golden way,\n  Riding royally to the school\nUnder the silvery willow-tree\n  Claim my bride of Tenko;\nSilver bells on a milk-white mule,\n  Rose-red sails on an emerald sea!\"\nKimi sometimes went to pray\nIn the temple nigh the bay,\nDreamed all night and gazed all day\n  Over the sea from Tenko.\n\nFar away his growing fame\nLit the clouds. No message came\n  From the sky, whereon she gazed\nUnder the silvery willow-tree\n  Far away from Tenko!\nSmall white hands in the temple raised\n  Pleaded with the Mystery--\n\"Stick of incense in the flame,\nThough my love forget my name,\nHelp him, bless him, all the same,\n  And ... bring him back to Tenko!\"\n\n_Rose-white temple nigh the bay,\nHush! for Kimi comes to pray,\nDream all night and gaze all day\n  Over the sea from Tenko._\n\nSo, when the rich young merchant       [Sidenote: V]\n  Showed him his bags of gold,\nYoichi Tenko, the painter,\n  Gave him her hand to hold,\nSaid, \"You shall wed him, O Kimi\":\n  Softly he lied and smiled--\n\"_Yea, for Sawara is wedded!\nLet him not mock you, child._\"\n\nDumbly she turned and left them,\n  Never a word or cry\nBroke from her lips' grey petals\n  Under the drifting sky:\nDown to the spray and the rainbows,\n  Where she had watched him of old\nPainting the rose-red islands,\n  Painting the sand's wet gold.\n\nDown to their dreams of sunset,\n  Frail as a flower's white ghost,\nLonely and lost she wandered\n  Down to the darkening coast;\nLost in the drifting midnight,\n  Weeping, desolate, blind\nMany went out to seek her:\n  Never a heart could find.\n\nYoichi Tenko, the painter\n  Plucked from his willow-tree\nTwo big paper lanterns\n  And ran to the brink of the sea;\nOver his head he held them,\n  Crying, and only heard\nSomewhere out in the darkness,\n  The cry of a wandering bird.\n\nPeonies, peonies thronged the May     [Sidenote: VI]\nWhen in royal-rich array\n  Came Sawara to the school\nUnder the silvery willow-tree--\n  To the school of Tenko!\nSilver bells on a milk-white mule,\n  Rose-red sails on an emerald sea!\nOver the bloom of the cherry spray,\nPeonies, peonies dimmed the day;\nAnd he rode the royal way\n  Back to Yoichi Tenko.\n\nYoichi Tenko, half afraid\nWhispered, \"Wed some other maid;\n  Kimi left me all alone\nUnder the silvery willow-tree,\n  Left me,\" whispered Tenko,\n\"Kimi had a heart of stone!\"--\n  \"Kimi, Kimi? Who is she?\nKimi? Ah, the child that played\nRound the willow-tree. She prayed\nOften; and, whate'er I said,\n  She believed it, Tenko.\"\n\nHe had come to paint anew\nThose dim isles of rose and blue,\n  For a palace far away,\nUnder the silvery willow-tree--\n  So he said to Tenko;\nAnd he painted, day by day,\n  Golden visions of the sea.\nNo, he had not come to woo;\nYet, had Kimi proven true,\nDoubtless he had loved her too,\n  Hardly less than Tenko.\n\nSince the thought was in his head,\nHe would make his choice and wed;\n  And a lovely maid he chose\nUnder the silvery willow-tree.\n  \"Fairer far,\" said Tenko.\n\"Kimi had a twisted nose,\n  And a foot too small, for me,\nAnd her face was dull as lead!\"\n\"Nay, a flower, be it white or red,\n  Is a flower,\" Sawara said!\n  \"So it is,\" said Tenko.\n\nGreat Sawara, the painter,           [Sidenote: VII]\n  Sought, on a day of days,\nOne of the peacock islands\n  Out in the sunset haze:\nRose-red sails on the water\n  Carried him quickly nigh:\nThere would he paint him a wonder,\n  Worthy of Hokusai.\n\nLo, as he leapt o'er the creaming\n  Roses of faery foam,\nOut of the green-lipped caverns\n  Under the isle's blue dome,\nWhite as a drifting snow-flake,\n  White as the moon's white flame,\nWhite as a ghost from the darkness,\n  Little O Kimi came.\n\n\"Long I have waited, Sawara,\n  Here in our sunset isle,\nSawara, Sawara, Sawara,\n  Look at me once, and smile:\n\nFace I have watched so long for,\n  Hands I have longed to hold,\nSawara, Sawara, Sawara,\n  Why is your heart so cold?\"\n\nSurely, he thought, I have painted\n  Nothing so fair as this\nMoonlit almond blossom\n  Sweet to fold and kiss....\n\"Kimi,\" he said, \"I am wedded!\n  Hush, for it could not be!\"\n\"Kiss me one kiss,\" she whispered,\n  \"Me also, even me.\"\n\nSmall and terribly drifting\n  Backward, her sad white face\nLifted up to Sawara\n  Once, in that lonely place,\nWhite as a drifting blossom\n  Under his wondering eyes,\nSlowly he gathered and held her\n  Under the drifting skies.\n\n\"Others are happy,\" she whispered,\n  \"Maidens and men I have seen:\nBe happy, be happy, Sawara!\n  The other--shall be--your queen!\nKiss me one kiss for parting\":\n  Trembling she lifted her head,\nThen like a broken blossom\n  It fell on his arm.
