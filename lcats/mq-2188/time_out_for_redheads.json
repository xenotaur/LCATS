    "body": "His name was Mikel Skot. He was thirty-four, five-feet-ten and lean,\nwith decent features and all his hair and quite nice brown eyes.\nBut somehow he always seemed to give the impression of being of\nindeterminate age, and slightly dusty. He lived alone, he gravitated\nbetween his job and his lodgings, and since the age of fourteen he had\nnever known a girl well enough to call her by her first name.\n\nFor twelve years, ever since 2827, he had sold tickets at one of\nthe windows of Time Travel Tours, Unlimited. If raises hadn't been\nautomatic, he would never have had one, though he was punctual,\nfaithful, honest, quick and accurate. Even the other ticket-sellers\nstill called him Citizen Skot.\n\nHe had never budged from his cozy era--even though, as an employee, he\nwas entitled to take any tour he wished, on his semi-annual vacation,\nat no cost to him beyond the planetary sales tax--nor had he ever left\nhis native city, let alone his native planet. He was too shy even to\nrealize he was lonely.\n\nThis morning there was the usual rush. Staggered vacations meant that\nany time of the year was the busy season for TTT. Skillfully Mikel\nSkot arranged tours and calculated rates.\n\n\"Two weeks in Rome, 45 B.C.? That will be creds 850, Citizen. You get\nyour costume and equipment in Room 104, right off the Teleport. Yes,\nI'm sure they'll have a Latin language-transformer you can hire.\"\n\"England in 1600, one month, reservation in the name of Chas Rusl. Yes,\nI have it right here. That will be creds 500, please.\" \"You mean you\nwant a ticket for here in Los, for a week six years ago in February?\nWhy, yes, it's a little unusual, but--oh, certainly, I understand--a\nsecond honeymoon. Congrats, Citizen--not many couples stay together\nthat long! Just a min, while I look up the rate for two.\"\n\nThe queue seemed endless, and crowds of travelers who already had\ntheir tickets were pushing their way through the doors back of the\nticket-office to the Teleport itself, together with the friends who\nwere seeing them off. If Mikel had had a moment to spare, which he\nhadn't, he might have wondered, as so often before, at the numbers of\npeople everybody except himself seemed to know.\n\nThe morning wore on, and he was beginning to think longingly of 13:30\no'clock, when his lunchtime relief would arrive and he could sit in a\nquiet corner of an Autocaf and watch the tridimens screen for the day's\nnews while he ate his favorite vitatabs and smoked a healthcig.\n\nThen everything happened all at once.\n\nThe girl standing at his ticket-window was a redhead. Her eyes were\ngreen, with little dancing amber lights in them, and she smiled at him\nas if he were the kind of man girls do smile at, and not ineffectual\nMikel Skot.\n\n\"Can you tell me,\" she began, in a warm, slightly husky voice.\n\nThen she screamed loudly and collapsed.\n\n\n\nThere were shouts and jostling and milling around, and somebody leaned\nover the counter and abruptly thrust something into his hand. He stood\nthere dazed, grabbing the object, whatever it was. Then he leaned over\nthe counter. The girl was lying there, very still. On one side of her a\npool of blood was slowly forming on the floor.\n\nThe guards were coming from all directions, trying to get some kind of\nquiet and order into the excited throng. Mikel looked down at the thing\nin his hand.\n\nIt was a knife, a steel knife with a wooden handle. It was obviously an\nantique, and of great value. And it was smeared with fresh blood.\n\nMikel Skot lost his head entirely. Never before had he, or anyone he\nhad ever heard of, been involved even remotely in any kind of violence.\nHe never even took in historical crime plays. The redheaded girl was\ndead, and he held in his hand the knife that had killed her. And she\nhad been the first girl who had smiled at him for years.\n\nHe wanted out--now!\n\nHe reached behind him and grabbed a ticket at random, not even looking\nto see what date it was. He punched it hastily for a week. Nobody was\nlooking at him; everybody was still yelling at everybody else, and the\nsweating guards were trying to line people up and blocking the doors\nso that they could not get away. Mikel ran to the corridor back of the\ncounters, which the ticket-sellers used, and saw that the company door\nto the Teleport was open. Out there, what with parties singing \"Happy\nTimetrav to You,\" or noisily greeting homecomers, and the loudspeaker\ndirecting passengers to their proper stations, and the roar of the\ntake-offs and returnjets, nobody seemed to have noticed that anything\nwas wrong in the ticket-office.\n\nMikel glanced around once to be sure that nobody was watching him, and\nslipped through the door. He was still holding the knife. Automatically\nhe thrust it into his belt-pouch.\n\nIt was typical of him that after twelve years not one of the Teleport\nattendants knew him by sight. He thrust his ticket at the nearest one.\nThe man glanced at it (three other travelers were trying to get his\nattention at the same time) and said \"Platform Eight.\" Mikel hurried\nthere.\n\nBefore he reached it he remembered something. He had punched the ticket\nfor duration, but not for place. Well, that was all right. If it had\nno place-punch, it would mean Los itself. He was escaping into his own\ncity.\n\nThe attendant at Eight took his ticket, then peered at him dubiously.\n\n\"You haven't clothes for the period, Citizen. Go to Room 104 and--\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" Mikel interrupted him. He was in a fever to be\ngone. \"I'm--it's a research project,\" he added in a sudden inspiration\nwhich didn't make sense even to himself, but which the attendant, used\nto strange statements from travelers, accepted without comment. He\nsealed the timeporter on to Mikel's wrist, set it for return in a week,\nand helped him into the telechamber.\n\nThere was a swift moment when his head felt empty and his stomach\nheaved: and Mikel Skot found himself sitting on an iron bench in a park.\n\nHe had a week now to think things over. He was in Los--he had to be,\nhis ticket said so.\n\nBut when?\n\nHe looked about him. It must be the middle of the day, the same time it\nhad been before, and the park was full of people on their lunch-hour.\nThey were dressed weirdly--the men and half the women wore tight\ncylindrical garments, one on each leg. The upper part of their bodies\nwere covered with various kinds of brightly-colored cloth, though\noccasionally he saw a woman who wore only a breast-holder above her\nbare midriff! Mikel, in his belted tunic, huddled in a corner of his\nbench, fearful of notice. But nobody paid any attention to him, and\nonce a man passed who had on a tunic too--a long white one, over bare\nfeet and under long hair and a flowing beard. Apparently in this period\npeople dressed as they pleased--at least in Los.\n\nThe city itself, what part of it he could see from his vantage-point,\nwas stranger than the people. There were no moving sidewalks, and\nno weather-canopies over the streets--though perhaps these had only\nbeen removed for the dry season. The buildings looked shrunken and\ntiny--hardly one seemed to be more than thirty or forty stories high.\nArchaic buses and motor-cars, apparently powered by some non-atomic\nfuel, plied the actual streets, instead of being confined to subways.\nThe skies were almost empty of planes, and those he saw were incredibly\nclumsy and slow. There was obviously no freeway for helicopters.\n\n\n\nIt was self-evident that he was in some year of the remote past, though\njust which, he had no idea. He wished he had taken time to glance at\nthe ticket before he handed it in. He wished he had studied history\nkomikbooks, or given more than a cursory glance at the telescreen\npropinforms of TTT. There was something to be said, after all, for the\nGeneral Educationalists, cranks as they were.\n\nCertainly this was not his Los--his giant city stretching from Mex\nto Sanfran without a break. This was a little place of probably not\nmuch more than two million inhabitants. Well, here he was for a week,\nand he'd better find out how he was going to eat and sleep. Properly\nequipped time travelers had money of the right period, but the cred\nchecks in his pouch would do him no good now. What did he have on him\nthat could be exchanged for board and lodging?\n\nOnly one object of undoubted value. The knife.\n\nSurreptitiously and with distaste he took it out and looked at it. The\nblood had dried on it and doubtless left traces on the lining of his\npouch. It was probably covered with the fingerprints of the murderer as\nwell as with his own. But it was all he had.\n\nIn the middle of the park there was a fountain, with a pool around it.\nCasually Mikel Skot strolled over to it and sat down on the ledge.\nWhen he was sure nobody was looking he dipped the knife in the water\nand scrubbed it dry on the inner hem of his tunic. There would still\nbe traces of blood which any chemist could find, of course; but nobody\nhere would be examining it for that. Since anyone could see that it was\nof immense value, he would have to account for possession of it. He\ncould say it was an heirloom.\n\nPutting it back in his pouch he approached a fat man on a bench nearby.\n\n\"Where is the nearest history museum, please, Citizen?\" he asked\npolitely.\n\nThe man looked up. He had been scanning a large piece of paper which\nMikel, with a thrill, recognized from one of his few visits to the\nMuseum of Antiquities. It was a thing called a newspaper, which had\nantedated the tridimens telescreen. He remembered that the specimens he\nhad seen had borne dates at the top, and if he could read the archaic\nprinting he could find out what year it was. But the man folded it up\nand thrust it under his arms as he answered.\n\n\"History museum?\" he echoed. \"Gosh, bud, I don't know. I'm a stranger\nhere myself--just got in from Kansas yesterday. You a foreigner?\" he\nasked with frank curiosity. \"You got a funny accent. And you sure look\nfunny.\"\n\nA foreigner--that was a good one! But Mikel had no time to waste.\nHe murmured \"Excuse,\" and left. The man stared after him and made a\ngesture which Mikel did not understand--describing a circle in the air\nnear his forehead.\n\nMikel walked to the edge of the little park and looked about him.\nAcross the street was a store with newspapers in racks in front of\nit. He could go over there and see the dates. But what did it really\nmatter? With his ignorance of all but the haziest generalities of\nhistory--he thought that once, thousands of years ago, Los had belonged\nto the Spaniards, and after that there was some kind of war that was\nmaybe called the American Revolution or the Civil War or the World War,\nhe was not sure which--it wouldn't do him much good to know whether he\nwas in, say, 1820 or 1960 or 2080. Besides, he was afraid to cross that\nstreet full of clumsy vehicles, and with neither an overpass nor an\nunderpass. Nowhere could he see anything that resembled a museum.\n\n\n\nFarther down on the same side of the street on which he stood, he saw\nsomething that looked faintly promising. He walked down to it, and\nfound a window full of odd-looking primitive objects, the nature of\nsome of which he could not guess. But there were knives among them,\nand a sign said, in ancient spelling, \"Jewelry Bought and Sold.\" On an\nimpulse he walked in.\n\nA man in another queer garment--some kind of cloth upper, with a white\nlinen thing beneath it and a ribbon tied around his neck--looked up\nwithout surprise at Mikel's literally untimely garb, and said: \"Yes,\nsir?\"\n\nMikel drew out the knife.\n\n\"Very valuable,\" he said. \"An heirloom. How much will you give me?\"\n\nThe man shrank back, not as if he were afraid of the knife, but as if\nhe were suddenly afraid of Mikel.\n\n\"You kidding me?\" he asked. \"Or is this a stick-up?\"\n\nMikel was not sure what the words meant, so he merely shook his head.\n\n\"Then are you nuts? There's nothing valuable about that thing. It's\njust an ordinary kitchen knife.\"\n\n\"Not valuable?\" Mikel's face fell. \"But look--wooden handle, steel\nblade.\"\n\n\"So what? Every knife has a wooden handle and a steel blade.\"\n\n\"You will not give me money for it?\"\n\n\"Of course not. We don't buy junk.\"\n\nThere was no use arguing. One age's antique is another age's junk.\nMikel sighed and departed quietly. How was he to get food and shelter\nfor a week?\n\nHe went back to the park and sat down again on a bench. He put the\nknife back in his pouch.\n\nThis was what came of panicking for the first time in his humdrum life.\nA sudden image of the redheaded girl came before his mind--her green\neyes and her smile. That girl--she was so pretty--and she had smiled at\nhim, whom girls never noticed. And then she had been killed. Now that\nit was too late, he wished he had stayed, whatever might have happened\nto him. He wanted to help, to avenge her; he wanted to be home again.\n\nHis stomach reminded him sharply that he had had no lunch. He had\nnever heard how long a man could go without eating. Could he even live\nthrough the week?\n\nHe sat there disconsolately, his eyes fixed on the ground. On his wrist\nwas sealed the little gadget that was his only means of ever seeing\n2839 again.\n\nSomebody came and sat down beside him. Deep in thought, he did not even\nglance up. A voice said, \"Can you tell me what time it is? My watch is\nbroken and there's no clock around here.\"\n\n\"Watch\"--that meant \"to be alert.\" \"Clock\"--that was an ancient\ntime-measuring device, he thought. The only way Mikel knew to tell the\ntime was to glance at the ceiling of any room, or if he were outdoors\nto tune in on his miniature tridimens gadget, attached to his belt. He\ndialed it now, but there was no response. Of course not--it wouldn't\nwork across perhaps a thousand years.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he answered. \"I can't.\"\n\nHe turned as he spoke. He jumped violently.\n\nThe speaker was a girl. She had red hair and green eyes. Otherwise\nthere was no resemblance, though she too was pretty. But red hair and\ngreen eyes seemed to be haunting him.\n\n\"What's that thing on your left wrist, then?\" asked the girl spunkily.\n\n\n\nMikel reddened. Rule Five of the booklets he handed out with the\ntickets to all travelers leaped into his mind: \"Remember, you cannot\nchange the course of history. To avoid confusion and difficulty, avoid\nrevealing to any person you meet in other time-periods the true nature\nof your presence there.\"\n\nHe broke the rule, and was sorry at once.\n\n\"It's a timeporter,\" he said, \"set for my return home.\"\n\nThe girl laughed.\n\n\"That's a good one. I thought I'd heard everything since I came to this\ncrazy place. What are you, an Arab, dressed in that tablecloth?\"\n\n\"I was born right here in Los,\" Mikel announced with dignity. \"I've\nalways lived here.\"\n\n\"So they grow them crazy here right from the start! Then where's your\nhome you're 'set' to return to?\"\n\n\"Here in Los.\"\n\nThe girl stood up hastily, a look of alarm on her face.\n\n\"Oh, please,\" Mikel cried, \"don't go. I can explain. Perhaps you can\nhelp me.\"\n\nShe sat down again dubiously.\n\n\"Well, I'm a sucker for a good story,\" she said. \"Shoot.\"\n\n\"I--I wouldn't shoot. I have no weapon.\"\n\nThat wasn't true--he did have a weapon: the knife. But he could hardly\nmention that. Anyway, the girl only laughed again.\n\n\"Wisecracks, yet,\" she said unintelligibly. \"Well, what's the story?\"\n\n\"I am from this place, but I am not from your time,\" Mikel began\nlaboriously; he was utterly unaccustomed to social conversation with a\nwoman. \"I am from--with me it is 2839.\"\n\n\"What in the--look, what are you advertising? Some science fiction\nmagazine?\"\n\n\"I don't understand that word--adver--what is it? Please believe me. I\nshouldn't tell you, I'm breaking a rule. But it is true.\"\n\n\"Go on.\" She fixed him with a skeptical glance.\n\n\"I was--I am a ticket-seller for Time Travel Tours. This morning--I\nmean what was to me this morning--a customer was killed at my window.\"\n\nHe plunged ahead. She listened in silence, a peculiar expression in her\neyes.\n\n\"So you see,\" he concluded, \"I am here for a week. But then I go\nback--the timeporter will see to that. I _want_ to go--I'm sorry I ran\naway. But I'm sure the police will say I did it, because of the knife.\"\n\n\"Let's see it.\"\n\nHe brought it out.\n\n\"Why, that's just an ordinary kitchen carving knife,\" she said, just\nas the man in the store had done. \"I suppose you _would_ call it an\nantique in--what was it?--2839. I still say you're haywire--or else\nthis is some new racket I don't get.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Okay, I guess you wouldn't--in 2839. The language would change plenty\nin 886 years.\" Once more her laugh rang out. \"I'll say you keep it up\nfine--that funny half-foreign way you pronounce your words. But I'll\nplay along, and pretend this is all on the up-and-up. Even so, it's\nhaywire--crazy. Because the dumbest cop in the world wouldn't suspect\nyou of the murder. Anybody'd know the murderer just got rid of the\nknife the quickest way he could. Gosh, you were behind your window,\nweren't you, and she was in front of it? Where was her stab wound?\"\n\n\"Wait--it's hard for me to understand. 'Cop'--is that slang for police?\nAnd the blood\"--he shuddered--\"came from her side. Either someone in\nfront or someone behind her could have done it.\"\n\n\"But they'll find out right away, won't they, that you didn't know the\ngirl? They'll find out who she was, and they'll grill everybody she\nknew, to see who had a reason for wanting her out of the way.... Listen\nto me! I'm as big a nut as you are. I'm talking just as if the whole\nthing really happened.\"\n\n\"It did happen,\" Mikel assured her earnestly. \"No, I didn't know her.\nI don't know any girls at all. I'm--I'm not attractive to women.\"\n\n\"Why, you're not so bad,\" said the girl kindly. \"I think you're kind\nof cute--or would be, if you weren't rigged up in those outlandish\nclothes,\" she paused, then continued, \"Well, if you can prove you\ndidn't know her, what have you got to worry about?\"\n\n\"The knife. And that I lost my head and ran.\"\n\n\n\nThe girl nodded. \"Leave the knife here, then. Or would that change the\ncourse of history?\" She smiled. \"Of course, what you ought to have done\nwas hand it right over. Then if it was such a great antique they'd not\nonly have the guy's fingerprints but they'd also find out who knew her\nthat worked in a museum or had a chance to steal it from one. That's\nelementary homicide procedure.\"\n\n\"You see,\" said Mikel, \"this also you won't believe. But our police are\nnot conditioned to take care of killings. This is the first time in\nmy whole life that I have ever even heard of one, except by accident.\nThe psychologists wouldn't allow anyone to grow up who had murderous\ntendencies that couldn't be sublimated.\"\n\n\"They let that one slip by them, didn't they? And do you mean that in\nthe great scientific future they tell us about, the police won't know\nas much about handling a homicide case as any hick constable knows\ntoday? Who're you trying to kid?\"\n\n\"We do not have crime. The police are to guard traffic and to take up\nfor reconditioning anybody who doesn't obey the civil rules. I don't\nknow much history, but I know there once were wars, and then there\nwere experts in war. Now--in my time--we have no wars, so there are no\nexperts. In the same way we have no experts in crime.\"\n\n\"Then what would they do to you, if they did convict you of this murder\nyou didn't commit?\"\n\n\"I don't know. There is no penalty for murder because there have been\nno murders for so long. This will be a world affair; the police will\nrefer it to the Supreme Council, and they will decide what to do. I\nsuppose they will have me euthanized as an atavistic deviant. That's\nwhy I lost my head. It was a totally new experience and I haven't been\nconditioned to new experiences. But even if they don't convict me,\nthey'll punish me for running away. They'll demote me, perhaps all the\nway back to where I started twelve years ago.\"\n\n\"It doesn't sound like much of a brave new world to me,\" said the girl\nin a disparaging tone. \"What's your name--or do you just have numbers?\"\n\n\"My name is Mikel Skot.\"\n\n\"Michael Scott--well, that sounds like a regular name, anyway. Mine's\nBetty French, by the way.\"\n\n\"Many grats to you, Citizen French. You have given me good advice. I\nknow now it is my duty to take the knife back with me, and give it to\nthe police. I shall tell them also about looking for somebody in a\nmuseum, as you suggested. But there will be no fingerprints--I washed\nthe knife in that fountain, when I hoped to sell it. I forgot it _must_\nexist in my era, or the murder could not have occurred.\n\n\"But that is not my big problem now. I have no money of your time. How\nshall I live until I can go home?\"\n\n\n\nBetty French seemed to stiffen. She looked at him disgustedly. \"I get\nit now,\" she said. \"I might have known. This is just a new way of\npanhandling. I certainly admire it--it's a work of art. Well, I got my\nmoney's worth. I'll pay for it.\"\n\nShe opened her handbag, drew out a dollar bill, and laid it on Mikel's\nknee. He gazed at it curiously, but made no attempt to pick it up.\n\n\"Is that your kind of money?\" he asked. \"What do I do in exchange for\nit?\"\n\n\"Oh, let's drop it,\" she sighed wearily. \"My lunch-hour's up, anyway.\nTake it--it'll buy you a hamburger and coffee, and then you can tell\nyour tale to the next comer and maybe get enough for a bed in a\nflophouse. Brother, you must have told it plenty, to get it all down so\npat. It's a wonder I've missed you before--or are you just starting to\nwork this neighborhood?\"\n\nShe snapped her bag shut and stood up.\n\n\"Please--I don't understand--why are you so angry?\"\n\nAt the desperation in his voice she turned and stopped.\n\n\"Look--I really have to get back to the office. This _is_ an act, isn't\nit? Come clean--aren't you panhandling?\"\n\n\"What does 'panhandling' mean?\"\n\n\"Oh, I give up! I guess you're just looney, after all. All right, Mike,\nlet's call it a day. You keep that buck, and now you just go to the\nnearest police station and tell them your story. They'll take you over\nto the psychiatric ward of the county hospital and you can get free\nboard and lodging there.\"\n\nMikel turned pale and shivered.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" he breathed. \"I'm not insane. If you don't believe me, no one\nelse will. And the hospital will euthanize me.\"\n\n\"Is that what they do to crazy people in--in your time?\"\n\n\"Of course. And they punish the psychologist who didn't detect the\ntendency and have the person euthanized in childhood.\"\n\n\"Suppose I give you my word they won't do that to you here and now?\nThey'll just observe you for a few days and then they'll have you\ncommitted to a state hospital.\"\n\n\"You are quite positive? If I can be sure of being alive a week from\nnow, no matter where I am, when the timeporter checks I'll go back\nhome.\"\n\n\"Even if you're in a padded cell?\"\n\n\"It won't matter where.\"\n\n\"Well, then, your problem's solved, isn't it? I'll show you how to get\nto the station.\"\n\n\"I must eat first. I'm very hungry. And what were those things you said\nif I should get--hamburger and coffee? They are--original foods? Our\nfood is all synthetic.\"\n\n\"You don't have to keep this up with me any more. There's a quick lunch\nplace.\" She pointed.\n\n\"And they won't mind in this Autocaf that I'm not dressed like the\nothers?\"\n\n\"In this burg? They wouldn't notice if you wandered around in a\nloincloth. Now I've _got_ to go. This is the wackiest thing that ever\nhappened to me, whatever it really means. Well, good luck, Mike!\"\n\n\"Grats to you, Citizen French, from deep in my pineal. Oh, wait just\none min more please!\"\n\n\"What is it now?\"\n\n\"You have given me so much to tell our police. But won't they wonder\n_why_ this man killed the girl?\"\n\n\"They can ask him when they catch them, can't they? But it's perfectly\nobvious. She was buying a ticket, wasn't she?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly.\"\n\n\"Well, that meant she was going away--leaving him, doesn't it? So he\nwas in love with her--maybe she was his wife--and he couldn't take it.\nMaybe she was going to some other guy--how do I know? He found out she\nwas deserting him, so he got hold of the knife, and followed her.\"\n\n\"But I don't see why.\" Mikel was utterly bewildered. \"She was a free\nagent, like anybody else. He couldn't object to her leaving if she no\nlonger loved him--he didn't _own_ her. That doesn't make sense. If I\ntell one of our police _that_ theory, she will surely think I'm insane.\"\n\n\"She?\"\n\n\"All our police are women, of course. Women are naturally gifted at\nkeeping order.\"\n\n\"You tell that to our cops, and they'll surely get you tucked away in a\nnice hospital, but fast. Well, why else _would_ he kill her?\"\n\n\"I don't know. That's why I asked you--you know so much more about such\nthings, in your barb--in your time.\"\n\n\"Your policewoman will have to figure it out for herself. So long,\nMike.\" She shook her head, smiling. \"Will I have a tale to tell the\ncrowd--if they don't decide I've gone nuts myself! Good-by!\"\n\n\"Goobie, Citizen, and grats again.\"\n\nStill smiling, she hurried down the path out of the park.\n\n\n\nWhen he could see her no longer, Mikel stood up and began hesitantly to\nwalk toward the restaurant she had pointed out. Fortunately, it was on\nthe same side of the street, not far past the shop where he tried to\nsell the knife.\n\nThis was not going to be plez, not at all plez. Despite what this Beti\nFrench had told him, he was nervous about putting himself in the hands\nof either the police or psychologist of this barbarous era. But there\ndidn't seem to be anything else he could do. His conversation with the\nredheaded girl had shown him clearly what kind of reception he would\nmeet from anyone else he ventured to approach.\n\nFirst he must eat--he was ravenous. He dared not ask for any food\nexcept the two things the girl had mentioned, whatever they were like.\nPresumably the money she had given him would be enough.\n\nThe restaurant had a long counter of some white substance, with stools\nfixed before it. Only one man sat there eating, but behind it stood\nanother man dressed in white, with a white cap on his head. Mikel\nperched himself on the nearest stool.\n\n\"Hamburger, coffee, please,\" he said, and laid Beti's money beside him\non the counter.\n\nThe other customer looked up and eyed him sharply, but the man behind\nthe counter merely yelled \"One on a bun!\" through a hole in the wall.\n\"Mustard?\" he asked, \"Onions? Cream?\"\n\n\"No, Citizen. Hamburger, coffee,\" Mikel repeated, flustered.\n\n\"A joker!\" the man grunted. \"This town! You in the movies, bud?\"\n\nMikel stared.\n\n\"He wants a burger without and coffee with,\" the other customer put in\nsuddenly. He picked up his dishes and slid down to the next stool. He\nwas a heavy-set, middle-aged man, dressed as the man in the store had\nbeen--in dark cloth bifurcated leg-coverings and a dark, long-sleeved\nupper garment over a light-colored under-garment, with a gaudy ribbon\naround his neck.\n\n\"Okay, okay,\" said the man in white placatingly, and set down before\nMikel something on a plate and something else in a cup, both hot. Mikel\nbegan sampling them gingerly with the unaccustomed implements. The\nrestaurant man took the money, put it in a box that rang a bell, and\nlaid down some small metal objects in its place. Then he disappeared\nthrough a door behind the counter.\n\nMikel's neighbor waited until he had gone. Then in a low voice he said:\n\n\"Finish the food, Citizen Skot. Then we'll talk.\"\n\nMikel looked up, frozen. The stranger shot his left wrist out from the\nsleeve. Sealed to it was a timeporter.\n\n\"From TTT executive, Citizen,\" he said briskly. \"I didn't think I'd\nfind you quite so soon, but I knew it wouldn't be long, since you\ndidn't wait to get proper equipment for your journey. It is fort for\nyou that this is perhaps the only place in this era where you would not\nhave been taken up at sight for wandering around in unusual clothing.\"\n\n\"How--how did you know what period--\"\n\n\"We only had to check the tickets, to see which was missing. Have you\nthe knife?\"\n\n\n\nMikel brought it out dumbly and laid it on the counter. The man put it\nin a pouch sewed into his lower garment.\n\n\"I didn't do it! I didn't!\" Mikel cried despairingly. He had lost his\nappetite completely.\n\n\"Sh! We don't want a fuss here. I am rechecking your timeporter,\nCitizen Skot. We are going back immediately.\"\n\n\"I--I didn't even know the girl!\" Mikel pleaded, remembering Beti\nFrench's instructions.\n\n\"We shall see as to that, when we get home,\" said the TTT executive\ngrimly.\n\nThen suddenly he burst out laughing. He laughed until he had to take a\nsmall piece of white material from his upper garment and wipe his eyes.\n\n\"I meant to give you a good scare, to put some sense into you,\" he\ngasped finally. \"But I can't keep it up. Citizen Skot, you are a fool.\"\n\n\"I know that, Citizen,\" said Mikel humbly.\n\n\"The psychologists really conditioned you a bit too well. I am told\nthat you live for your work and have no recreation at all. You are as\nignorant of the world as a small child. Come, did you ever hear of a\nmurder in our time, anywhere, in all your life?\"\n\n\"No. But I know such things occur.\"\n\n\"In the past, not in our time. How could there be a murder in our era?\nIn the old times, people killed one another for jealousy, for revenge,\nfor greed. Such incentives do not exist in the 29th century. The only\nother possibility would be insanity, and the psychologists would never\nallow that to proceed to such a point--the diseased person would be\neuthanized at the very first symptoms.\"\n\n\"But the girl _was_ killed, right before my eyes.\"\n\n\"My poor man, you were a victim of your own ridiculously retired\nexistence. Anyone else would have guessed at once. It was planned that\nway so as to get a good effect of a crowd in confusion--most of them\nwere extras. Of course all the arrangements had been made with us\nbeforehand, and the concealed telcams were focused away from any Time\nTravel signs.\"\n\n\"Telecams?\"\n\n\"World Theater was making a historical crime tridimens in modern\ndress, Citizen Skot. The girl was an actress. The blood was faked.\nThey thought it would be more effective not to put an actor behind the\nticket-window, but to use a real ticket-seller without warning him,\njust as part of the crowd wasn't warned. It worked beautifully--they\ntell me your fright and horror showed up wonderfully well.\n\n\"They picked your window because they said they liked your looks--I\ncan't imagine why. That was their big mistake. Any other of our\nticket-sellers would have waited to see what happened next. You, you\ndumble, fell into a panic and ran away. And I've had to leave my desk\nin the middle of a busy aftern to go and fetch you. We couldn't let\nyou wander around here for a week without means of subsistence, and\nthinking you were suspected of murder!\"\n\n\"I suppose I'll be demoted now,\" Mikel said gloomily.\n\n\"That wouldn't be fair. This wasn't one of the known responsibilities\nof your position. No, but I imagine you'll come in for a lot of\nwhiffing, to use a slang expression.\"\n\n\"Kidding--that's what they call it here, I think. Well, I'm used to\nthat.\"\n\n\"And Dafne Dart says she's wild to meet you.\"\n\n\"Dafne Dart? Who's she?\" Mikel looked alarmed again.\n\n\"Your performance made a tremend impression on her. She told me to tell\nyou she thinks 'you're purely vlumpish.' She's the actress who played\nthe murder victim.\"\n\n\"That red-haired girl with the green eyes with flecks of amber in\nthem?\" asked Mikel eagerly. \"With the streely smile and the gorge\nvoice?\"\n\n\"You seem to have noticed her,\" said the TTT executive dryly. \"Yes,\nthat's the one. I thought you didn't go for women.\"\n\n\"But that's different!\" Mikel Skot caroled. \"Redheads with green\neyes--that's the one kind that crashes me and that I crash--I just\nfound it out today.\n\n\"Come on, Citizen, what are we waiting for? Let's Go!\"",
