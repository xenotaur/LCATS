    "body": "BY GEORGE O. SMITH\n\n\nYou can keep a good man down, if you\u2019ve got enough headstart, are alert\nand persistent ... so long as he limits himself to acting like a good\nman....\n\n\nIT WAS 047-63-10 when he opened the door. Before his superior could\nchew him for prepunctuality, Huvane said as the chief looked up and\nopened his mouth to start:\n\n\u201cSorry, but you should know. Terra is at it again.\u201d\n\nChelan\u2019s jaw snapped shut. He passed a hand over his face and asked in\na tone of pure exasperation. \u201cThe same?\u201d and as Huvane nodded, Chelan\nwent on, \u201cWhy can\u2019t they make a mistake and blow themselves out of our\nhair? How far did they get this time?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd out?\u201d\n\nHuvane sat down shaking his head slowly. \u201cNot yet, but they\u2019re over the\nhump, you know.\u201d Huvane\u2019s face brightened ever so slightly. \u201cI can\u2019t be\ncriticized for not counting them, chief. But I\u2019ll estimate that there\nmust be at least a couple of hundred atoms of 109 already. And you know\nthat nobody could _make_ 109 if they hadn\u2019t already evolved methods of\nmeasuring the properties of individual atoms. So as soon as they find\nthat their boom-sample doesn\u2019t behave like the standard mess out of a\nbombardment chamber, they won\u2019t rest until they find out why. They\u2019ll\nfind out. Then it\u2019ll be 109, 109, 109 until we\u2019re forced to clobber\nthem again.\u201d\n\nBitterly Chelan looked up. \u201cI don\u2019t think I need the lecture. I admire\ntheir tenacity. I admire their ambition. I admire their blasphemous,\nconsignatory, obscenity attitude of acting as if the Great Creator had\nconcocted the whole glorious Universe for their own playground. Yes,\u201d\nsaid the chief wearily, \u201csingly they aren\u2019t bad traits. Boiled down\ninto the self-esteem of a single race, I don\u2019t admire them any more.\nI\u2019m simply scared.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. Well, we\u2019ve got time.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot much. What\u2019s their space potential this time?\u201d\n\n\u201cStill scragged on the mass-inertia-relativity barrier. Tailburners ...\ner, chemical reaction engines. Manned and unmanned orbital flights.\nHalf a dozen landings on their sister planet. No,\u201d said Huvane as he\nsaw the chief\u2019s puzzlement, \u201cI don\u2019t mean Number Two ... the one they\ncall Venus this time. I mean their co-orbital companion. _The_ Moon.\nThey still call it that.\u201d\n\nThe chief looked up wonderingly. \u201cDo you suppose,\u201d he asked solemnly,\n\u201cthat there is really something called a \u2018racial memory\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s against all the theory,\u201d objected Huvane. \u201cBut there seems to\nbe\u2014\u201d his voice trailed off absently. It returned after some thought:\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried to sort it out, just as if I were one of them. The\nrecurrence of their ... er ... \u2018names of antiquity\u2019 as they call them,\nseem to recur and recur. Their Planet Two, now called Venus, was called\nAstarte last time, and before that it was Ishtar.\u201d\n\n\u201cOther way around.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter. The names are still being used and, according to their\nbelief, merely parallel names culled out of local pagan religious\nbeliefs.\u201d\n\nThe chief nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s only part of the parallelism. The big thing\nis the way they follow the same pattern. Savage, agrarian, urban, right\non up the ladder according to the rules of civic science but squabbling\nand battling all the way right on up and out into space. Hell, Huvane,\nwarfare and conflict I can both understand and cope with, but not the\nTerran flavor. They don\u2019t come out bent on conquest or stellar\ncolonialism. They come out with their little private fight still going\non and each side lines up its volume of influence and pits one against\nthe other until the whole section of that spiral arm is glittering like\na sputtering spark along a train of black powder. I wish,\u201d he said\nsavagely, \u201cthat we could cut off that arm and fling it deep into\nextragalactic space.\u201d\n\nHuvane shook his head. \u201cAnd leave the problem for our children to\nsolve?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll have one to solve, I think,\u201d said Chelan. \u201cIn another twenty\nthousand years the Terrans will be right back doing business at the\nsame old stand. Unless we can solve it for once and for all right now.\u201d\n\nHuvane looked around as if he were seeking another door to the chief\u2019s\noffice. \u201cHow?\u201d he asked sarcastically. \u201cThe first time we greeted them\nand they took both our welcome and us for everything they could before\nwe pulled the rug out from under them. The second time we boxed them\noff and they broke out after converting the isolation screen into an\noffensive weapon. The third time we tried to avoid them and they ran\nwild exploiting less ambitious races. The fourth time we missed the\nboat and they were chewing at our back door before we knew about them;\ncontaining them was almost a nova job. The fifth time we went in and\ntried to understand them, they traded us two for one. Two things they\ndidn\u2019t want for one they did,\u201d Huvane\u2019s lips curled, \u201cand I\u2019m not sure\nthat they didn\u2019t trade us the other way around; two they needed for one\nthey declared useless. Sixth? that was the last time and they just came\nout shooting as if the whole galaxy automatically objected. This time?\nWho knows?\u201d Huvane sat down again and put his hands between his knees.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t operate like _people_. Sensible folk settle their own\nproblems, then look for more. Terra? One half of the globe is against\nthe other half of the globe. Fighting one another tooth and nail, they\nstill find time to invent and cross space to other planets and continue\ntheir fight on unknown territory.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019d better just admit that we don\u2019t know the solution. Then we\ncan clobber Terra back to the swamp, juggle the place into another ice\nage, put the details down in History, and hope that our remote progeny\nwill be smarter than we.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike maybe we\u2019re smarter than our remote ancestors?\u201d jeered Huvane.\n\n\u201cGot a better idea?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe. Has anybody really taken a couple of them and _analyzed_ them?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inhumane.\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree, but\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cGet me a healthy, well-balanced specimen of somewhat\nbetter-than-average education and training. Can do?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan do. But how are you going to keep him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t intend to study him like I\u2019d study a bug under a microscope.\nThis one won\u2019t get away. Make it in fourteen versaids, Huvane.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake it in ten plus or minus a radite or two. So long!\u201d\n\n\nThe beast at Cape Canaveral stood three hundred and fifteen feet tall\ndwarfing her creators into microscopic proportions. Swarming up and\ndown the gantry, bug-sized humans crawled in and out of check ports\nwith instrument checks, hauling hoses, cables, lines. Some thousand\nfeet away, a puff-bomb of red smoke billowed out and a habit-flattened\nvoice announced: \u201cAt the mark, X Minus Fifteen Minutes ... ... ...\nMark! X Minus Fifteen Minutes!\u201d\n\nJerry Markham said, \u201cThat\u2019s me!\u201d He looked up at the lofty porthole and\nalmost lost his balance over backwards sighting it. He was a healthy\nspecimen, about twenty-four and full of life. He had spent the day\ngoing through two routines that were sometimes simultaneous and at\nother times serially; one re-stating his instructions letter by letter\nincluding the various alternatives and contingencies that involved his\nmaking decisions if the conditions on Venus were according to this\ntheory or that. The other was a rigorous medical checkup. Neither of\nthem showed that Jerry Markham had spent the previous night in\nactivities not recommended by his superiors but nothing that would\nbounce him if they knew. He could hardly be broken for living it up at\na party.\n\nHe shook hands with the boss and stepped into the elevator. It was not\nhis idea of a proper send-off. There should be bands playing and girls\nthrowing paper tape, flowers and a few drinks. Sally should send him\noff with a proud smooch of lipstick and a tearful promise to wait.\nInstead it was all very military and strict and serious\u2014which is why\nhe\u2019d whooped it up the night before. He\u2019d had his good night and good\nby with Sally Forman, but now eighteen hours later he was fit and\nraring for a return match.\n\nJerry\u2019s mind was by no means concerned with this next half hour, which\nwould be the most perilous part of his flight. Tomorrow would take care\nof itself. The possibility that thirty minutes from now he might be\ndead in a flaming pyre did not cross his mind, the chance that an hour\nfrom now he could be told that his bird was off-course and his fate\nstarvation if it obtained an untrue orbit or abrupt destruction if it\ndidn\u2019t orbit at all\u2014nothing bothered him.\n\nHe sat there chanting the count down with the official timer and braced\nhimself when the call came:\n\n\u201cZero! Fire!\u201d\n\nInwardly, Jerry Markham\u2019s mind said, \u201cWe\u2019re off!\u201d and he began to look\nforward to his landing on Venus. Not the problems of landing, but what\nhe would find there when he soared down through the clouds.\n\nDetermined to hold up through the high-G even though nobody watched, he\nwent on and on and up and up, his radio voiced the progress tinnily.\nShock followed roaring pressure, release followed shock. Orientation\nwas lost; only logic and intellect told him where he was and which way\nhe was going.\n\nThen he was free. Free to eat and drink and read and smoke one\ncigarette every three hours and, in essence, behave in about the same\nway as a prisoner confined in solitary. The similarity did not bother\nJerry Markham, for this was honor, not punishment.\n\n\nHuvane collected him with the ease of a fisherman landing a netted\ncrab. Easily, painlessly. Shockingly, for the crab doesn\u2019t exactly take\nto the net with docility.\n\nHuvane collected the whole shebang, man and machinery; then opened the\nspacecraft with the same attitude as a man peeling the lid from a can\nof sardines. He could have breached the air lock, but he wanted the\nTerran to understand the power behind the act.\n\nJerry Markham came out blinking; very mildly wondering about the air.\nIt was good. Without considering the rather high probability that\nnobody spoke the language, he blurted:\n\n\u201cWhat gives?\u201d\n\nHe was not very much surprised when one of them in uniform said curtly,\n\u201cThis way and make it snappy, Terran!\u201d\n\nNo, he was not surprised. He was too stunned to permit anything as\nsimple as surprise. And through the shock and the stun, his months of\ntraining came through. Jerry Markham worried his first worry: _How was\nhe going to get the word back home?_\n\nConfinement in the metal cell of his top-stage hadn\u2019t bothered him. The\nconcept of landing on a planet that couldn\u2019t come closer to home than\nsome twenty-seven million miles was mere peanuts. Isolation for a year\nwas no more than a hiatus, a period of adventure that would be rewarded\nmany-fold. Sally? So she might not wait but there were others; he\u2019d\nenvisioned himself fighting them off with a club after his successful\nreturn. Hell, they\u2019d swarmed him before his take-off, starting with the\nmoment his number had come up as possible candidate.\n\nNo, the meeting with competence in space did not shock him greatly.\nWhat bothered him was his lack of control over the situation. Had he\nseen them and passed on about his business, he recounted the incident.\n\nAs it was, his desire to tell somebody about it was cut off. As he sat,\nalone and helpless, it occurred to him that he did not mind so much the\ndying, if that was to be his lot. What mattered was the unmarked grave.\nThe mourning did not move him; the physical concept of \u201cgrave\u201d and its\nfill of moldering organic substances was nothing. It was mere symbol.\nSo long as people knew how and where, it made little difference to\nJerry Markham whether he was planted in a duridium casket guaranteed to\npreserve the dead flesh for a thousand years or whether he went out in\na bright swift flame that glinted in its tongues of the color-traces of\nincandescent elements of human organic chemistry.\n\nSo long as people knew. Where and how. Vague, vague, mass-volumized\nconcept. Granite tomb was one idea, here was a _place_. Point a\nspread-fingered hand in a waving sweep across the sky that encompasses\nthe Plane of The Ecliptic and say, \u201cIt is there,\u201d and another _place_\nis identified. Lost on Venus is no more than a phrase; from Terra Haute\nor Times Square, Venus is a tiny point in the sky smaller to the vision\nthan the granite of Grant\u2019s Tomb.\n\nImagination breeds irritation. Would they call it pilot error or\nequipment unreliability? Dying he could face. Goofing would be a\ndisgrace that he would have to meet in fact or in symbol. Hardware\ncrackup was a matter of the laws of probability. Not only his duty\ndemanded that he report, his essence cried out for a voice to _let them\nknow_.\n\nAnybody.\n\nJust the chance to tell one other human soul.\n\nChelan asked, \u201cWho are you? Your name and rank?\u201d\n\nHe said sullenly, \u201cGo to hell.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have ways and means.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cUse \u2019em.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we said that we mean no harm; if we asked what we could do to prove\nit, what would be your reply?\u201d\n\n\u201cTake me back and let me go.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are you? Will you identify yourself?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cStubborn Terran!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know my rights. We are not at war. I\u2019ll tell you nothing. Why did\nyou capture me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll ask the questions, Terran.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get no answers.\u201d He sneered at them angrily. \u201cTorture me\u2014and\nthen wonder whether my screamings tell the truth. Dope me and wonder\nwhether what I truly believe is fact or fantasy.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d said Chelan, \u201cwe only want to understand your kind. To know\nwhat makes you tick.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you ask?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried and we get no answers. Terran, the Universe is a vastness\nbeyond comprehension. Co-operate and give us what we want to know and a\npiece of it is yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cNuts!\u201d\n\n\u201cTerran, you have friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho doesn\u2019t?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t we be your friends?\u201d\n\nAngrily, resentfully, \u201cYour way isn\u2019t friendly enough to convince me.\u201d\n\nChelan shook his head. \u201cTake him away,\u201d he directed in his own tongue.\n\n\u201cWhere? And how shall we keep him?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the place we\u2019ve prepared. And keep him safe.\u201d\n\nHuvane asked, \u201cSafe? Who knows what is safe? One bribed his guards. One\nseduced her guards. One dug his way out scratch by scratch.\nDisappeared, died, dead, gone, mingled off with the myriad of\nworlds\u2014did one get home, perhaps, to start their legend of the gods in\nthe sky; the legend that never dies through the rise and fall of\nculture from savagery to ... to ... to Element 109?\u201d\n\nChelan looked at Jerry Markham, the Terran looked back defiantly as if\nhe were guest instead of captive. \u201cCo-operate,\u201d breathed Chelan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you nothing. Force me. I can\u2019t stop that.\u201d\n\nChelan shook his head sorrowfully. \u201cExtracting what you know would be\nless than the play of a child,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, Terran. We can know what\nyou know in the turn of a dial. What we need is that which you do not\nknow. Laugh? Or is that a sneer? No matter. What you know is worthless.\nYour problems and your ambitions, both racial and personal, are minor.\nWe know them already. The pattern is repetitive, only some of the names\nare changed.\n\n\u201cBut why? Ah, that we must know. Why are you what you are? Seven times\nin History Terra has come up from the mud, seven times along the same\nroute. Seven times a history of ten thousand years from savage to\nsavant, from beast to brilliance and always with the same will to do\u2014to\ndo what? To die for what? To fight for what?\u201d\n\nChelan waved Huvane to take the Terran away.\n\n\nHuvane said, \u201cHe\u2019s locked in air-tight with guards who can be trusted.\nNow what do we do with him?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will co-operate.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy force?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Huvane. By depriving him of the one thing that Life cannot exist\nwithout.\u201d\n\n\u201cFood? Safety?\u201d\n\nChelan shook his head. \u201cMore primitive than these.\u201d He lowered his\nvoice. \u201cHe suffers now from being cut off from his kind. Life starts,\ncomplaining about the treatment it receives during the miracle of birth\nand crying for its first breath of air. Life departs gasping for air,\nwith someone listening for the last words, the last message from the\ndying. Communication, Huvane, is the primary drive of all Life, from\nplant to animal to man\u2014and if such exists, superman.\n\n\u201cThrough communication Life goes on. Communication is the prime\nrequisite to procreation. The firefly signals his mate by night, the\nhuman male entices his woman with honeyed words and is not the gift of\na jewel a crystalline, enduring statement of his undying affection?\u201d\n\nChelan dropped his flowery manner and went on in a more casual vein:\n\u201cHuvane, boil it down to the least attractive form of simplification,\nno life stands alone. And no viable life goes on without communication,\nI shall shut off the Terran\u2019s communication.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen he will go rank staring, raving mad.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, for I shall offer him the alternative. Co-operate, or molder in\nutter blankness.\u201d\n\nHuvane shrugged. \u201cSeems to me that any Terran locked in a duralim cell\nso far from home the distance means nothing is already cut from\ncommunication.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeeper, deeper, Huvane. The brain lies prisoner within a cell of bone.\nIts contact with the Outside world lies along five channels of sensory\ncommunication. Everything that the brain believes about the Universe is\nthe product of sensory information carried inward by sight, touch,\nsound, taste and smell. From five basic bits of information, knowledge\nof the Great Truth is formed through logic and self-argument.\nEverything.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, now stop. I am not expressing my own singular opinion. I believe a\nrather great proportion of the things that I was taught, and I was\ntaught through the self-same five sensory channel.\u201d\n\n\u201cUm-m-m.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Just plain \u2018Um-m-m.\u2019 Now we shall shut off the Terran\u2019s channels\nof communication until he consents as an alternative. This, Huvane,\nhasn\u2019t been tried before. It may bring us the final important bit of\ninformation.\u201d\n\n\nSlowly the lights went out. Jerry Markham was prepared for dark\nisolation, he could do nothing about it so he accepted it by the simple\nprocess of assuring himself that things were going to get worse before\nthey got better.\n\nThe darkness became\u2014absolute. Utter. Complete. Not even the dots and\nwhorls and specks that are technically called \u201cVisual noise\u201d occurred.\nA level of mental alertness niggled at him; for nearly twenty-four\nyears it had been a busy little chunk of his mind. It was that section\nthat inspected the data for important program material and decided\nwhich was trivial and which was worthy of the Big Boy\u2019s attention. Now\nit was out of a job because there wasn\u2019t even a faint background count\nof plateau-noise to occupy its attention.\n\nThe silence grew\u2014vast. Brain said that the solid walls were no more\nthan ten feet from him; ears said that he was in the precise middle of\nabsolutely nowhere. Feeling said that the floor was under his feet,\nears said that upward pressure touched his soles. Deeper grew the\ndeadening of his ears, and orientation was lost. Feeling remained and\nhe felt his heart beating in a hunting rhythm because the\nsound-feedback through the ear was gone, and the hortator had lost his\naudible beat.\n\nFeeling died and he knew not whether he stood or sat or floated askew.\nFeeling died and with it went that delicate motor control that directs\nthe position of muscle and limb and enables a man to place his little\nfinger on the tip of his nose with his eyes closed.\n\nAside from the presence of foreign matter, the taste of a clean mouth\nis\u2014tasteless. The term is relative. Jerry Markham learned what real\ntastelessness was. It was flat and blank and\u2014nothingness.\n\nChemists tell us that air is tasteless, colorless, and odorless, but\nwhen sense is gone abruptly one realizes that the air does indeed have\nits aroma.\n\nIn an unemployed body the primitive sensors of the mind had nothing to\ndo, and like a man trained to busy-ness, loafing was their hardest\ntask. Gone was every sensory stimulus. His heart pumped from habit, not\ncontrolled by the feedback of sound or feeling. He breathed, but he did\nnot hear the inrush of air. Brain told him to be careful of his mouth,\nthe sharp teeth could bite the dead tongue and he could bleed to death\nnever feeling pain nor even the swift flow of salty warmth.\nHabit-trained nerves caused a false tickle in his throat; he never knew\nwhether he coughed or whether he thought that he coughed.\n\nThe sense of time deserted him when the metronome of heartbeat died.\nDetermined Brain compromised by assuming that crude time could be kept\nby the function of hunger, elimination, weariness. Logical Brain\npointed out that he could starve to death and feel nothing; elimination\nwas a sensory thing no more; weariness was of the body that brought no\ninformation anyway\u2014and what, indeed was sleep?\n\nBrain considered this question. Brain said, I am Jerry Markham. But is\nit true that no brain can think of nothing? Is it possible that \u201cSleep\u201d\nis the condition that obtains when the body stops conveying reliable\ninformation to the brain, and then says to Hell with Everything and\ndecides to stop thinking?\n\nThe Brain called Jerry Markham did not stop thinking. It lost its time\nsense, but not completely. A period of time passed, a whirlwind of\nthoughts and dreamlike actions went on, and then calmness came for a\nwhile.\n\nDreams? Now ponder the big question. Does the brain dream the dream as\na sensory experience\u2014or is a dream no more than a sequence of assorted\nmemories? Would a dying brain expire in pleasure during a pleasant\ndream\u2014or is the enjoyment of a pleasant dream only available to the\nafter-awakened brain?\n\nWhat is Man but his Memories?\n\n\nIn one very odd manner, the brain of Jerry Markham retained its\nintellectual orientation, and realized that its physical orientation\nwas uncontrollable and undetectable and therefore of no importance.\nLike the lighthouse keeper who could not sleep when the diaphone did\nnot wrneeee-hrnawwww for five seconds of each and every minute, Jerry\nMarkham\u2019s brain was filled with a mild concern about the total lack of\nunimportant but habitual data. There was no speckle of light to\nclassify and ignore, no susurrus of air molecules raining against the\neardrum. Blankness replaced the smell and taste and their absence was\nas disturbing as a pungence or a poison. And, of course, one should\nfeel something if it is no more than the tonus of muscle against the\nmobile bones.\n\nCommunication is the prime drive of life. Cut off from external\ncommunication entirely, section A, bay 6, tier 9, row 13 hollered over\nto box Q, line 23, aisle F and wanted to know what was going on. The\ngang on the upper deck hailed the boiler room, and the crew in the\nbleacher seats reported that the folks in charge of\nC.I.C.\u2014Communication Information Center\u2014were sitting on their hands\nbecause they didn\u2019t have anything to do. One collection of bored brain\ncells stirred. They hadn\u2019t been called upon since Jerry Markham sang\n\u201c_Adeste Fidelis_\u201d in memorized Latin some fifteen years earlier and so\nthey started the claque. Like an auditorium full of people impatient\nbecause the curtain had not gone up on time, bedlam broke loose.\n\nBedlam is subject to the laws of periodicity, stochastic analysis, and\nwith some rather brilliant manipulation it can be reduced to a Fourier\nSeries. Fourier says that Maxwell is right and goes on to define\nexactly when, in a series of combined periodicities of apparently\nrandom motion, all the little particles will be moving in the same\ndirection. Stochastic analysis says that if the letter \u201cU\u201d follows the\nletter \u201cQ\u201d in most cases, words beginning with \u201cQ\u201d will have \u201cU\u201d for a\nsecond letter.\n\nJerry Markham began to think. Isolated and alone, prisoner in the cell\nof bone, with absolutely nothing to distract him, the Brain by common\nconsent pounded a gavel, held a conference, appointed a chairman and\nsettled down to do the one job that the Brain was assembled to do. In\nunison, ten to the sixteenth storage cells turned butter side up at the\nsingle wave of a mental flag.\n\nHe thought of his father and his mother; of his Sally. He thought of\nhis commanding officer and of the fellows he liked and disliked. The\nprimitive urge to communicate was upon him, because he must first\nestablish communication before he could rise from the stony mineral\nstage to the exalted level of a vegetable. Bereft of his normal senses,\nundistracted by trivia such as noise and pain and the inestimable\nvastness of information bits that must be considered and evaluated, his\nbrain called upon his memory and provided the background details.\n\nThe measured tread of a company of marching soldiers can wreck a\nbridge.\n\nThe cadence of ten to the sixteenth brain cells, undivided by the\ndistraction of incoming information, broke down a mental barrier.\n\nAs vividly as the living truth, Jerry Markham envisioned himself\nsauntering down the sidewalk. The breeze was on his face and the\npavement was beneath his feet, the air was laden with its myriad of\nsmells and the flavor of a cigarette was on his tongue. His eyes saw\nSally running toward him, her cry of greeting was a welcome sound and\nthe pressure of her hug was strong and physical as the taste of her\nlips.\n\nReal.\n\nShe hugged his arm and said, \u201cYour folks are waiting.\u201d\n\nJerry laughed. \u201cLet the general wait a bit longer,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got\na lot to tell him.\u201d\n\n\nHuvane said, \u201cGone!\u201d and the sound of his voice re-echoed back and\nforth across the empty cell.\n\n\u201cGone,\u201d repeated Chelan. \u201cUtterly incomprehensible, but none the less a\nfact. But how\u2014? Isolated, alone, imprisoned\u2014cut off from all\ncommunication. All communication\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get another specimen, chief.\u201d\n\nChelan shook his head. \u201cSeven times we\u2019ve slapped them down. Seven\ntimes we\u2019ve watched their rise\u2014and wondered how they did it. Seven\ntimes they would have surpassed us if we hadn\u2019t blocked them. Let them\nrise, let them run the Universe. They\u2019re determined to do that anyway.\nAnd now I think it\u2019s time for us to stop annoying our betters. I\u2019d hate\nto face them if they were angry.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut chief, he was cut off from all communication\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously,\u201d said Chelan, \u201cnot!\u201d\n\nTHE END",
