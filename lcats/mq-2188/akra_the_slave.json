    "body": "He thought to see me tremble\nAnd totter as an oar-snapt reed,\nWhen he spake death to me--\nMy courage, toppled in the dust,\nEven as the head of cactus\nThe camel-keeper slashes\nThat his beasts may browse, unscathed,\nThe succulent, wounded green.\nHe thought to have me, broken,\nAnd grovelling at his feet;\nMouthing and mumbling to his sandal-ties,\nIn stammering dread of death--\nAye! even as a king,\nWho, having from death's hand,\nReceived his crown and kingdom,\nFor ever treads in terror of the hour\nWhen death shall jog his elbow,\nTwitch the purple from his shoulders,\nAnd claim again the borrowed crown.\nBut, little need have I to fear\nThe crouching, lean camp-follower,\nUnto whose ever-gaping maw,\nDay after day, I flung\nThe spoils of bow and arrow,\nEre I was taken captive--\nI, who have often, at my mother's breast,\nAwakened in the night-time,\nTo see death leering on me from the cave-mouth,\nA gaunt and slinking shape\nThat snuffed the dying embers,\nBlotting out the friendly stars--\nI, who, a scarce-weaned boy,\nHave toddled, gay and fearless,\nDown the narrow jungle-track,\nThrough bodeful forest-darkness, panther-eyed;\nAnd have felt cold snakes uncoiling\nAnd gliding 'neath my naked sole,\nFrom clammy slumber startled;\nWhile, with sharp snap and crackle,\nBeast-trodden branches strained behind me,\nMy father's hand scarce snatching me\nBefore the spring of crouching death!\nBut, naught of this the King could know,\nHe only knew that, on that far-off morning,\nWhen first I came before him, captive,\nAmong my captive brothers,\nAnd, as he lightly held, in idle fingers,\nAbove my unbowed head,\nIn equal poise\nDeath's freedom\nOr the servitude of life,\nI clutched at life:\nAnd cared but little that his lips\nShould curl, to see me, broken,\nA slave among his slaves.\nYet, never slave of his was I;\nNor did I take my new life from his nod--\nI ... I who could have torn\nThe proud life out of him,\nBefore his guards could stay me...\nHad she not sat beside him, on her throne.\n\nAnd he, who knew not then,\nNor ever, till to-day,\nHas known me aught but slave,\nRemembering that time,\nSpake doom of death to me,\nIdly, as to a slave:\nAnd I await the end of night,\nAnd dawn of death,\nEven as a slave awaits...\nNay! as the unvanquished veteran\nAwaits the hour of victory.\n\nIn silence, wheels the night,\nStar-marshalled, over dreaming Babylon;\nAnd none in all the sleeping city stirs,\nSave the cloaked sentries on the outer walls\nWho tread out patience 'twixt the gates of brass,\nNumb with scarce-baffled slumber,\nOr, maybe, some unsleeping priest of Bel,\nA lonely warder of eternity,\nWho watches on the temple's seventh stage,\nWith the unslumbering gods.\nYet, may not she, the Queen,\nWhose beauty, slaying my body,\nBrings my soul to immortal birth,\nAlthough she does not know\nOf my last vigil on the peak of life--\nYet, may not she awaken, troubled\nBy strange, bewildering dreams,\nWith heart a little fearful of the dawn\nOf day, yet unrevealed?\n\nThere is no sound at all,\nSave only the cool plashing\nOf fountains in the courtyard\nWithout my lonely cell:\nFor fate has granted to me\nThis last, least consolation of sweet sound\nThough in the plains I perish,\nI shall hear the noise of waters,\nThe noise of running waters,\nAs I die.\nMy earliest lullaby shall sing\nMy heart again to slumber.\nAnd, even now, I hear\nStream-voices, long-forgotten, calling me\nBack to the hills of home;\nAnd, dreaming, I remember\nThe little yellow brooks\nThat ever, day and night,\nGush down the mountains singing,\nSinging by the caves:\nAnd hearkening unto them,\nOnce more a tiny baby,\nA wee brown fist I dabble\nIn the foaming cool,\nFrothing round my wrist,\nSpurting up my arm,\nSpraying my warm face;\nAnd then again I chuckle,\nAs I see an empty gourd,\nFallen in the swirling waters,\nBobbing on the tawny eddies,\nSwiftly out of sight.\n\nAnd yet most clearly to remembrance comes\nThat far-off night, in early Spring,\nWhen, loud with melted snow from Northern peaks,\nThe torrent roared and fretted;\nWhile, couched within the cavern,\nThe clamour kept me wakeful;\nAnd, even when I slept,\nTumbled, tumultuous, through my dreams,\nAnd seemed to surge about me,\nAs the brawl of armed men.\nAnd once I sprang from slumber,\nHot and startled,\nDreaming that I felt\nA warm breath on my cheek,\nAs if a jackal nuzzled me;\nOr some dread, slinking foe\nMade certain of my sleeping\nBefore he plunged the steel.\nBut nothing stirred within the glimmering cavern,\nWhere, all around me, lay my sleeping kindred;\nAnd, when I stole without, with noiseless footsteps,\nTo rouse the smouldering watchfire into flame,\nAnd cast fresh, crackling brushwood on the blaze,\nI caught no glint of arms betwixt the branches,\nNor any sound or rumour, save\nThe choral noise of cold hill-waters,\nCold hill-waters singing,\nSinging to the stars.\nAnd so I turned me from the brooding night;\nAnd, couched again upon the leopard-skins,\nI slept, till dawn, in dream-untroubled sleep.\n\nI woke to see the cold sky kindling red,\nBeyond the mounded ash of the spent fire;\nAnd lay, a moment, watching\nThe pearly light, caught, trembling,\nIn dewy-beaded spiders' webs\nAbout the cave-mouth woven.\nThen I arose;\nAnd left my kindred, slumbering--\nMy mother, by my father,\nAnd, at her breast, her youngest babe,\nWith dimpled fingers clutching at her bosom;\nAnd, all around them, lying\nTheir sons and daughters, beautiful in sleep,\nWith parted lips,\nAnd easy limbs outstretched\nAlong the tumbled bedskins:\nAnd while they slumbered yet in shades of night,\nI sprang out naked\nInto eager dawn.\nThe sun had not yet scaled the eastern ridge:\nAnd still the vales were hidden from my eyes\nBy snowy wreaths of swathing mist:\nBut, high upon a scar\nThat jutted sheer and stark,\nIn cold grey light,\nThere stood an antelope,\nWith lifted muzzle snuffing the fresh day;\nWhen scenting me afar,\nHe plunged into the mist\nWith one quick, startled bound:\nAnd, from the smoking vapour,\nArose a gentle pattering,\nAs, down the rocky trail,\nThe unseen herd went trotting\nUpon their leader's heels.\nAnd from the clear horizon\nThe exultant sun sprang god-like:\nAnd on a little mound I stood,\nWith eager arms outstretched,\nThat, over my cold body,\nThe first warm golden beams\nOf his life-giving light might fall.\nAnd thus, awhile, I stood.\nIn radiant adoration tranced,\nUntil I caught the call of waters;\nAnd, running downwards to the stream,\nThat plunged into a darkling pool,\nWhere, in the rock was scooped a wide, deep basin;\nUpon the glassy brink,\nA moment, I hung, shivering,\nAnd gazing down through deeps of lucent shadow;\nAnd then I leapt headlong,\nAnd felt the cloven waters\nClosing, icy-cold, above me,\nAnd, again, with sobbing breath,\nBattled to the light and air:\nAnd I ran into the sunshine,\nShaking from my tingling limbs\nShowers of scintillating drops\nOver radiant, dewy beds\nOf the snowy cyclamen,\nAnd dark-red anemone,\nTill my tawny body glowed\nWith warm, ruddy, pulsing life.\nAnd then again I sought the stream,\nAnd plunged; and now, more boldly,\nI crossed the pool, with easy stroke;\nAnd climbed the further crag;\nAnd, turning, plunged again.\nAnd so, I dived and swam,\nTill pangs of hunger pricked\nMy idle fancy homeward:\nAnd eagerly I climbed the hill;\nWhen, not a sling's throw from the cavern,\nStooping to pluck a red anemone,\nTo prank the wet, black tangle of my hair,\nI heard a shout;\nAnd looking up,\nI saw strange men\nWith lifted spears\nBear down on me:\nAnd as I turned,\nA javelin sang\nAbove my shrinking shoulder,\nAnd bit the ground before me.\nBut, swift as light I sped,\nUntil I reached the pool,\nAnd leapt therein:\nAnd he who pressed most hotly on my heels,\nFell stumbling after.\nStill I never slackened,\nAlthough I heard a floundering splash,\nAnd then the laughter of his comrades:\nAnd, as I swam for life,\nBetwixt my thrusting heels,\nAnother spear that clove the crystal waters\nGlanced underneath my body,\nAnd in the stream-bed quivered bolt upright,\nCaught in a cleft of rock.\nWith frantic arm I struck\nStraight as a snake across the pool,\nAnd climbed the further bank;\nAnd plunging through deep brake,\nRan wildly onward,\nStartling as I went\nA browsing herd of antelope,\nThat, bounding, fled before me down the valley\nAnd after them I raced,\nAs though the hunter,\nNot the hunted,\nUntil the chase sang in my blood,\nAnd braced my straining thews.\nI knew not if men followed,\nYet, on I sped, impetuously,\nAs speeds the fleet-foot onaga,\nThat breasts the windy morning,\nWith lifted head, and nostrils wide,\nExultant in his youth.\nSo, on and ever on,\nScarce knowing why I ran--\nEnough for me to feel\nEarth beaten back behind my heels,\nAnd hear the loud air singing\nThe blood-song in my ears:\nTill, stumbling headlong over\nAn unseen, fallen branch,\nI rolled in a deep bed of withered leaves;\nAnd lay, full-length in shuddering ecstasy\nOf hot, tumultuous blood that rioted\nThrough every throbbing vein.\nBut when again, I breathed more easily,\nAnd my wild, fluttering heart kept slower beat,\nHot-foot, my thoughts ran, wondering, backward:\nAnd I arose and followed them\nWith swift and stealthy pace,\nUntil I reached the stream.\nAlong the bank I stole with wary step,\nUntil I came to where the waters\nNarrowed, raging through a gorge,\nNigh the threshold of my home:\nAnd across the thunderous flood,\nFrom crag to crag I leapt:\nAnd then I climbed a cedar,\nFrom whose close ambush I could watch\nWho came or went about the cavern-mouth.\nI lay along a level branch:\nAnd, through the thick, dark screen,\nI peered with eager eyes:\nBut no one crossed my sight.\nThe whole land lay before me, drowsing\nIn deepest noonday slumber:\nNo twig stirred in the breathless blaze;\nAnd underneath the boughs no serpent rustled:\nAnd, in the earth and air,\nNaught waked, save one lone eagle, nigh the sun,\nWith wings, unbaffled, beating\nUp the blue, unclouded heavens.\nA dreamless, suave security\nSeemed brooding o'er the valley's golden slumber,\nWhence rang or flashed no hint of lurking peril.\nI dropped to earth,\nAnd crouching low,\nI stole yet nearer\nThrough the brake:\nTill, drawing nigh the cavern-mouth,\nI heard the sound of half-hushed sobbing:\nAnd then I saw, within the gloom,\nMy mother and my sisters clustering round\nMy father's body, lying stark and dead,\nA spear-wound in his breast.\nAnd as I crept to them, they did not hear me,\nNor ever lift their heads;\nBut, shuddering, crouched together,\nWith drooping breasts half-hid in falling hair,\nBy that familiar form\nIn such strange slumber bound.\nOnly the baby, on her shoulder slung,\nSaw me, and crowed me greeting,\nAs I stooped down to touch my weeping mother,\nWho, turning suddenly,\nWith wild tear-fevered eyes;\nArose with whispered warning;\nBut, even then, too late.\nAlready, from behind,\nAround my throat\nAn arm was flung;\nAnd heavily I fell:\nYet, with a desperate wrench,\nI slipped the clutch of my assailant:\nAnd picking up a slingstone that lay handy,\nI crashed it through his helm;\nAnd dead he dropped.\nAnd now upon me all his fellows thronged,\nLike hounds about an antelope;\nAnd gripped my naked limbs,\nAnd dragged me down,\nA struggling beast, among them:\nAnd desperately I fought,\nAs fights the boar at bay,\nWhen all the yelling pack,\nWith lathered lips, and white teeth gnashing,\nIs closing in upon him;\nAnd in his quivering flank, and gasping throat,\nHe feels the fangs of death:\nTill, overcome at last,\nThey bound me hand and foot,\nWith knotted, leathern thongs;\nAnd dragged me out to where, beneath the trees,\nTrussed in like manner, with defiant eyes,\nMy brothers lay, already, side by side.\nThey laid me in the shade;\nAnd flicked my wincing spirit\nWith laughter and light words:\n\"Now is the roe-buck taken!\"\nThen another,\nOn whose dark, sullen face there burned a livid weal\n\"A buck in flight's a panther brought to bay!\"\nAnd then his fellow:\n\"True enough! and yet,\nFor such young thews they give good gold--\nThey give good gold in Babylon!\"\nAnd, laughing thus, they left us,\nTo lie through hours of aching silence,\nUntil, at length, the cool of evening fell;\nWhen they returned from slumber;\nAnd loosed the ankle-cords that we might stand;\nAnd bade our mother feed us;\nAnd she, with tender fingers, held\nThe milk-bowl to our parching lips;\nAnd thrust dried dates betwixt our teeth;\nAnd wept, to see us standing there,\nWith helpless hands, before her.\nThen, bringing out their mules, they saddled them;\nAnd tied us to the girths on either hand.\nThey drove my weeping sisters from the cavern;\nAnd sought to tear my mother from her home;\nBut she escaped them;\nAnd they let her bide\nAmid the ruins of her life,\nWhose light had dropped, so suddenly,\nFrom out the highest heavens:\nAnd, when I turned to look on her,\nAnd win from her a last farewell,\nI saw her, sitting desolate betwixt\nHer silent husband and her wailing babe,\nWith still, strange eyes,\nThat stared upon the dead, unseeing,\nWhile her own children went from her,\nScarce knowing that they left her, nevermore\nTo look upon her face.\n\nThus, we set out, as over\nThe darkening, Southern crags\nThe new moon's keen, curved blade was thrust:\nMy sisters trooping on before us,\nLike a drove of young gazelles,\nWhich, in the dead of night,\nWith pards in leash, and torches flaring,\nThe hunters have encompassed.\nThey moved with timid steps,\nAnd little runs;\nStumbling, with stifled cries;\nAnd starting, panic-shot,\nFrom every lurking shadow--\nBehind them, terror's lifted lash:\nBefore them, ever crouching,\nThe horror of the unknown night--\nWhile, as they moved before us,\nThe moonlight shivered off their shrinking shoulders\nAnd naked, glancing limbs,\nIn shimmering, strange beauty.\nAnd closely on their heels,\nI, with my brothers, foremost in the file,\nMarched, tethered 'twixt the plodding beasts,\nWhose stolid riders sat,\nEach with his javelin on the pummel couched,\nIn watchful silence, with dark eyes alert.\nAnd once, nigh driven crazy\nBy the tugging of the thongs,\nI sprang into the air,\nAs down a rocky steep we scrambled;\nAnd strove to burst the galling bonds,\nOr hurl my guards on one another;\nBut, all too sure of foot, the beasts,\nAnd too securely girths and cords\nHeld me, and I stumbled.\nInstantly a thong\nStruck my wincing shoulders,\nBlow on thudding blow.\nI bit my lips; and strode on silently;\nNor fought again for freedom.\nSo on we journeyed through the night,\nAnd down familiar mountain-tracks,\nThrough deep, dark forest,\nEver down and down;\nFording the streams, whose moon-bright waters flowed,\nIn eddies of delicious, aching cool,\nAbout our weary thighs.\nAnd, once, when in mid-torrent,\nThat swirled, girth-high about the plunging beasts,\nA startled otter, glancing\nBefore their very hoofs,\nAffrighted them; and, rearing,\nWith blind and desperate floundering,\nThey nearly dragged us down to death:\nAnd, ere we righted,\nWith a fearful cry,\nMy eldest sister from the bevy broke;\nAnd struck down-stream\nWith wild arm lashing desperately,\nUntil the current caught her;\nAnd she sank, to rise no more.\nAnd on again we travelled,\nDown through the darkling woodlands:\nAnd once I saw green, burning eyes,\nWhere, on a low-hung bough,\nA night-black panther crouched,\nAs though to pounce upon my sisters;\nBut, the sudden crack of whips,\nStartling him, he snarled;\nAnd turned with lashing tail,\nCrashing through dense brushwood.\n\nWhen, once, again we came unto a clearing,\nThe night was near its noon:\nAnd all the vales that lay before us\nWere filled with moving, moonlit mists,\nThat seemed phantasmal waters\nOf that enchanted world,\nWhere we, in dreams, sail over still lagoons,\nThroughout eternal night,\nAnd under unknown stars.\nStill, on we fared, unresting,\nUntil the low moon paled;\nWhen, halting on a mountain-spur,\nWe first looked down on Babylon,\nFar in the dreaming West,\nA cluster of dim towers,\nScarce visible to wearied eyes.\nWe camped within a sheltering cedar-grove;\nAnd all the day, beneath the level boughs,\nUpon the agelong-bedded needles lay,\nHalf-slumbering, with fleeting, fretful dreams\nThat could not quite forget the chafing cords,\nThat held our arms in aching numbness:\nBut, ere the noon, in sounder sleep I sank,\nDreaming I floated on a still, deep pool,\nBeneath dark, overhanging branches;\nAnd seemed to feel upon my cheek\nThe cool caress of waters;\nWhile, far above me, through the night of trees,\nNoon glimmered faintly as the glint of stars.\nAs thus I lay, in indolent ecstasy,\nO'er me, suddenly, the waters\nCurved, and I was dragged,\nDown and down,\nThrough gurgling deeps\nOf swirling, drowning darkness...\nWhen I awoke in terror;\nAnd strove to sit upright;\nBut, tautly, with a jerk,\nThe thongs that held me to my brothers,\nDragged me back to earth.\n\nAwhile I lay, with staring eyes, awake,\nWatching a big, grey spider, crouched overhead,\nIn ambush 'neath a twig, beside her web,\nOft sallying out, to bind yet more securely,\nThe half-entangled flies.\nAnd then, once more, I slumbered;\nAnd dreamed a face leant over me,\nMore fair than any face\nMy waking eyes had ever looked upon.\nIts beauty burned above me,\nNot dusky like my sisters' faces,\nBut pale as the wan moon,\nReflected in a flood\nOf darkly flowing waters,\nOr as the creaming froth,\nThat, born amid the thunder of the fall,\nFloats on the river's bosom in the sunshine,\nBubble after bubble,\nPerishing in air.\nSo, a moment, over me,\nWith frail and fleeting glimmer\nOf strange elusive, evanescent light,\nThe holy vision hovered.\nAnd yet, whenever, with a fervent longing,\nI sought to look into the darkling eyes,\nThe face would fade from me,\nAs foam caught in an eddy:\nUntil, at last, I wakened,\nAnd, wondering, saw a pale star gleaming\nBetwixt the cedar-branches.\nAnd soon our captors stirred:\nAnd we arose, to see\nThe walls and towers of Babylon, dark\nAgainst the clear rose of the afterglow,\nAlready in the surge of shadows caught,\nAs night, beneath us, slowly Westward swept,\nFlooding the dreaming plain that lay before us,\nVast, limitless, bewildering,\nAnd strange to mountain-eyes.\nAs down the slope we went,\nAnd when, at last, we left behind\nThe hills and singing waters,\nA vague, oppressive fear\nOf those dim, silent leagues of level land,\nFell on me; and I almost seemed\nTo bear upon my shoulders\nThe vaster dome of overwhelming night;\nAnd, trembling like a child,\nI looked askance at my two captors,\nAs they rode on in heedless silence,\nTheir swarthy faces sharp\nAgainst the lucent sky.\nAnd then, once more,\nThe old, familiar watchfires of the stars\nBrought courage to my bosom;\nAnd the young moon's brilliant horn\nWas exalted in the sky:\nAnd soon, the glooming wilderness\nAwoke with glittering waters,\nAs a friendly wind sang unto me\nAmong the swaying reeds:\nWhile, cloud on cloud,\nThe snowy flocks of pelican\nBefore our coming rose;\nAnd, as they swerved to Southward,\nThe moonlight shivered off their flashing pinions.\n\nSo, on we marched, till dawn, across the plain;\nAnd, on and on,\nBeneath the waxing moon,\nEach night we travelled Westward;\nUntil, at last, we halted\nBy the broad dull-gleaming flood\nOf mighty, roaring Tigris;\nAnd aroused from midnight slumber\nThe surly, grumbling ferrymen,\nAnd crossed the swollen waters\nUpon the great, skin rafts:\nThen on again we fared,\nUntil the far, dim towers soared in the dawnlight\nAnd we encamped beside a stream,\nBeneath dry, rustling palms.\nAnd heavily I slumbered:\nAnd only wakened once, at noon,\nWhen, lifting up my head,\nI saw the towers of Babylon, burning blue,\nFar off, in the blind heat:\nAnd slept again, till sunset,\nWhen we took our Westward course\nAlong the low bank of a broad canal,\nThat glimmered wanly 'neath a moonless sky.\nHigher, and higher still,\nAs we drew slowly nearer,\nArose the vasty walls and serried towers,\nThat seemed to thrust among the stars,\nAnd on embattled summits bear the night,\nUnbowed beneath their burden,\nAs easily as, with unruffled brows,\nAnd limber, upright bodies,\nThe village-daughters carry\nAt eve the brimming pitchers,\nPoised upon their heads.\nAnd when, above us, the wide-looming walls\nShut out the Western stars;\nBeneath their shade, at midnight, we encamped,\nTo await till dawn should open\nThe city gates for us.\nThat night we did not sleep,\nBut, crouched upon the ground,\nWe watched the moon rise over Babylon,\nTill, far behind us, o'er the glittering waste,\nWas flung the wall's huge shadow,\nAnd the moving shades of sentries,\nWho, unseen above our heads,\nPaced through the night incessantly.\nThus long we sat, hushed with awed expectation,\nAnd gazing o'er the plain that we had travelled,\nAs, gradually, the climbing moon,\nEscaping from the clustering towers,\nRevealed far-gleaming waters,\nAnd the sharp, shrill cry of owls,\nSweeping by on noiseless plumes,\nAssailed the vasty silence,\nShivering off like darts\nFrom some impenetrable shield.\nAnd, as we waited,\nSometimes, fearfully,\nI gazed up those stupendous, soaring walls\nOf that great, slumbering city, wondering\nWhat doom behind the bastioned ramparts slept,\nWhat destiny, beneath the brooding night,\nAwaited me beyond the brazen gates.\nBut, naught the blind, indifferent stars revealed,\nThough towards the long night's ending,\nHalf-dazed with gazing up that aching height,\nA drowsiness fell over me,\nAnd in a restless waking-trance I lay,\nDreaming that Life and Death before me stood.\nAnd, as each thrust towards me a shrouded cup,\nImplacable silence bade me choose and drink.\nBut, as I stretched a blind, uncertain hand\nTo take the cup of death,\nI wakened, and dawn trembled,\nAt last, beyond the Eastern hills,\nAnd, star by star, night failed;\nAnd eagerly the sun leapt up the sky,\nAnd, as his flashing rays\nSmote kindling towers and flaming gates of brass,\nAcross the reedy moat\nA clattering drawbridge fell,\nAnd wide the glittering portals slowly swung:\nAnd there came streaming out in slow procession\nA sleepy caravan of slouching camels,\nGroaning and grumbling as they strode along\nBeneath their mountainous burdens,\nUpon whose swaying summits,\nImpassively, the blue-robed merchants sat.\nThey passed us slowly by,\nAnd then we took the bridge,\nAnd, while our captors parleyed with the guards,\nWho stood, on either hand,\nWith naked swords,\nI turned my head,\nAnd saw for the last time, far Eastward,\nThe cold, snow-brilliant peaks,\nBeyond my dim, blue, native hills.\nAnd, as I looked, my thoughts flew homeward,\nAnd I, one dreaming moment,\nStood by my mourning mother in the cavern\nOf desolation, looking on the dead.\nAnd then, between the brazen gate-posts,\nAnd underneath the brazen lintel,\nAt last we entered Babylon.\nBefore us, yet another wall arose,\nAnd, turning sharply\nDown a narrow way,\nThe living breath of heaven seemed shut from us\nAs though beneath the beetling crags\nOf some deep mountain-gorge--\nBy cliffs of wall, on either hand,\nThat soared up to the narrow sky,\nWhich with dim lustre lit\nThe shimmering surface of enamelled brick,\nWhereon, through giant groves,\nBlue-coated hunters chased the boar,\nOr 'loosed red-tasselled falcon\nAfter flying crane.\nBut soon we reached another gate,\nSword-guarded, and we entered,\nAnd plunged into the traffic\nOf clamorous merchantmen,\nSpeeding their business ere the heat of day.\nAnd as we jostled, slowly,\nThrough bewildering bazaars,\nThe porters and the idler wayfarers\nAll turned to look upon our shame,\nWith cold, unpitying eyes,\nAnd indolent, gaping mouths,\nOr jested with our captors,\nUntil we left the busier thoroughfares,\nAnd walked through groves of cypress and of ilex,\nWhere not a sound or rumour troubled\nThe silence of the dark-plumed boughs\nAnd glimmering deeps of peace,\nSave only the cool spurt of waters\nThat, from a myriad unseen jets,\nFretted the crystal airs of morning,\nAnd fell in frolic showers\nOf twinkling, rainbow drops,\nThat plashed in unseen basins;\nAnd through the blaze of almond-orchards,\nTremulous with blossom\nThat flickered in a rosy, silken snow\nOf falling petals over us,\nAnd wreathed about our feet\nIn soft and scented drifts;\nBeneath pomegranate trees in young, green leaf,\nAnd through vast gardens, glowing with strange flowers,\nSuch as no April kindled into bloom\nAmong the valleys of my native hills.\nWe came unto a court of many fountains,\nWhere, leaping off their jaded mules,\nOur captors loosed the thongs that held us,\nBut left our wrists still bound.\nAnd one with great clay pitchers came,\nAnd over our hot bodies, travel-stained,\nPoured out cool, cleansing waters\nIn a gurgling, crystal stream,\nAnd flung coarse robes of indigo\nAbout our naked shoulders.\nAnd here we left behind us\nThe maidens and the younger boys,\nAnd passing through a gateway,\nCame out upon a busy wharf,\nWhere, southward, midway through the city,\nThe broad Euphrates flows,\nHis dark flood thronged with merchant-dhows,\nAnd fishing-boats of reed and bitumen,\nPiled high with glistering barbel, freshly-caught;\nAnd foreign craft, with many-coloured sails,\nAnd laden deep with precious merchandise,\nThat, over wide, bewildering waters,\nAcross the perilous world,\nThe adventurous, dark-bearded mariners,\nWho swear by unknown gods in alien tongues,\nBring ever to the gates of Babylon.\nWe crossed the drawbridge, round whose granite piers\nSwirled strong, Spring-swollen waters,\nLoud and tawny,\nAnd, through great brazen portals,\nPassed within the palace gates,\nWhen first I saw afar the hanging-gardens,\nArch on arch,\nAnd tier on tier,\nAgainst a glowing sky.\nTwo strapping Nubians, like young giants\nHewn from blue-black marble\nBy some immortal hand in immemorial ages,\nLed us slowly onward.\nThe dappled pard-skins, slung across their shoulders,\nScarcely hid the ox-like thews,\nBeneath the dark skin rippling,\nAs they strode along before us.\nThrough courts of alabaster,\nAnd painted corridors,\n\nAnd chambers fair with flowery tapestries\nThey led us, wondering, till at last we came\nInto a vast, dim hall of glimmering gold,\nThe end of all our journeying.\nAnd, as we halted on the threshold,\nMy eyes could see but little for a moment,\nIn the dusky, heavy air,\nThrough the ceaseless cloud of incense,\nRising from the smouldering braziers\nTo the gold, grey-clouded dome,\nTingling strangely in my nostrils,\nAs I came from morning airs;\nThen slowly filling them with drowsy fume,\nWhen, looking up with half-dazed eyes,\nI saw the King upon his golden throne:\nAnd through my body\nRaged rebellious blood,\nIn baffled riot beating\nAt my corded wrists,\nAs if to burst the galling bonds,\nThat I might hurl that lean, swart face,\nSo idly turning towards us,\nWith thin curled lips,\nAnd cold, incurious eyes,\nTo headlong death--\nYea! even though I tumbled\nThe towers of Babylon round about my head.\nAnd, when our captors bowed their foreheads low,\nObsequious to the throne,\nI stood upright,\nAnd gazed my loathing on that listless form--\nThe gay, embroidered robe,\nThe golden cap, that prankt the crisped locks,\nThe short, square beard, new-oiled and barbered--\nBut, in a flash,\nA heavy blow\nFell on my head,\nAnd struck me to my knees\nBefore the sleek, indifferent king.\nAnd then, on either hand,\nWith gripping palms upon my shoulders set,\nThe Nubians towered above me\nLike mighty men of stone.\nAnd savagely I struggled,\nHalf-stunned, to rise again;\nWhen, as I vainly battled\nIn their unrelenting clutch,\nMy eyes lit for the first time on the Queen,\nWho sat upon the dais, by her lord\nHalf-shadowed, on a throne of ivory,\nAnd all the hate died in me, as I saw\nThe face that hovered over me in dream,\nWhen I had slept beneath the low-boughed cedar:\nThe moon-pale brows, o'er which the clustered hair\nHung like the smoke of torches, ruddy-gold,\nAgainst a canopy of peacock plumes:\nThe deep brown, burning eyes,\nFrom which the soul looked on me in fierce pity.\nAnd, as I gazed on that exultant beauty,\nThe hunter and the slayer of men\nWas slain within me instantly,\nAnd I forgot the mountains and my home;\nMy desolate mother, and my father's death;\nMy captive sisters ... and the throned King!\nI was as one, that moment,\nNew-born into the world\nFull-limbed and thewed,\nYet, with the wondering heart\nOf earth-bewildered childhood.\nAnd, unto me, it seemed\nThat, as the Queen looked down on me,\nThere stole into her eyes\nSome dim remembrance of old dreams,\nThat in their brown depths flickered\nWith strange, elusive light,\nLike stars that tremble in still forest-pools.\nOne spake--\nI scarce knew whom, nor cared--\nAnd bade me choose,\nBefore the throne,\nBetween a life of slavery,\nOr merciful, swift death--\nDeath, that but a moment since,\nI would have dragged, exulting, on me--\nAnd with my eyes still set on the Queen's face,\nI answered:\n\"I will serve\":\nAnd scarcely heeded that my wrists were loosed.\n\nAnd, huddled in a stifling hut,\nThat night, among my fellows,\nI could not sleep at all:\nBut gazed, wild-eyed, till dawn upon that face,\nWhich hovered o'er me, like the moon of dreams;\nAnd seemed to draw the wandering tides of life\nIn one vast wave, which ever strove\nTo climb the heavens wherein she moved,\nThat it might break in triumphing foam about her.\nNot then, nor ever afterwards,\nWas I a slave, among my fellow-slaves,\nBut one, who, with mean drudgery,\nAnd daily penance serves\nBefore a holy altar,\nThat, sometimes, as he labours, his glad eyes\nMay catch a gleam of the immortal light\nWithin the secret shrine;\nYea! and, maybe, shall look, one day, with trembling,\nOn the bright-haired, imperishable god.\nAnd, even when, day after day,\nI bore the big reed-baskets, laden\nWith wet clay, digged beyond the Western moat,\nAlthough I seemed to tread,\nAs treads the ox that turns the water-wheel,\nA blindfold round of servitude,\nMy quenchless vision ever burned before me:\nAnd when, in after days, I fed\nThe roaring oven-furnaces;\nAnd toiled by them through sweltering days,\nThough over me, at times, would come\nGreat longing for the hill-tops,\nAnd the noise of torrent-waters:\nOr when, more skilled, I moulded\nThe damp clay into bricks;\nAnd spread the colour and the glaze;\nAnd in strength-giving heat of glowing kilns,\nI baked them durable,\nClean-shaped, and meet for service:\nMy vision flamed yet brighter;\nAnd unto me it seemed\nAs if my gross and useless clay were burned\nIn a white ecstasy of lustral fire,\nThat, in the fashioning of the house of love,\nI might serve perfectly the builder's need.\nThus, many months, I laboured;\nTill, one day, at the noontide hour of rest,\nI lay; and with a sharpened reed--\nAs temple-scribes write down the holy lore\nOn tablets of wet clay--\nOn the moist earth beside me,\nI limned a young fawn, cropping\nA bunch of tender, overhanging leaves.\nAnd, as I slowly drew,\nI dreamt a little sadly of the days,\nWhen I, too, roamed, untethered,\nAnd drinking in, unquestioning,\nThe sunshine and the air,\nAnd all the rapture of the earth that turns,\nNew every morning to the wondering sun,\nRefashioned in still nights of starry dews:\nBut one, the while, unseen of me,\nWatched my unconscious hand, approving:\nAnd I was set, next morning,\nAmong the craftsmen, who so deftly limned\nThe hunts and battles for the palace walls.\nAnd, happily, with them I lived\nA life of loving labour, for each line\nFlowed from the knowledge of my heart:\nI drew the startled ostrich\nFleeing from the far-flung noose:\nThe brindled lynx; the onaga\nIn dewy-plashing flight;\nThe bristling boar, at bay,\nCrouched in a deadly ring of threatening spears,\nWith streaming nostrils, and red eyes ablaze;\nThe striped hyaena; the gaunt, green-eyed wolf;\nThe skulking jackal; the grey, brush-tailed fox;\nThe hunting leopard and the antelope,\nIn mid-chase tense,\nWith every thew astrain;\nThe dappled panther; the brown-eyed gazelle,\nButting with black horns through the tangled brake\nThe nimble hare, alert, with pricked-up ears;\nThe tiger, crouched, with yellow eyes afire;\nThe shaggy mountain-goat,\nPerched on the utmost crag,\nAgainst the afterglow of lucent ruby,\nOr, poised with bunching hoofs\nIn mid-spring over a dark, yawning chasm;\nOr the black stallion, with his tameless troop,\nFording a mountain-river in the dawn.\nAnd, sometimes, as we toiled,\nA terrible fleeting rapture\nWould come upon me, when the Queen\nPassed by us with her maidens;\nOr paused, a moment, gazing,\nWith tranced and kindling eyes upon our labours:\nBut never did I dare, at any time,\nTo lift my eyes to hers,\nAnd look, as soul on soul,\nAs on the day her beauty brought to birth\nThe strange new life within me.\nIn silence she would ever leave us;\nAnd ever with her passing perished\nThe light and colour of my work;\nSo that my heart failed, daunted by that glimpse\nOf the ever-living beauty.\nAnd, sometimes, I would carve in ruddy teak,\nOr ivory, from the Indian merchants bought,\nOr in the rare, black basalt, little beasts\nTo please the idle fancies of the King;\nOr model in wet clay, and cast in bronze,\nGreat bulls and lions for the palace-courts;\nOr carve him seals of lapis-lazuli,\nOf jasper, amethyst and serpentine,\nChalcedony--carnelian, chrysoprase,\nAgate, sardonyx, and chalcedonyx--\nGreen jade, and alabaster;\nOr cut in stones that flashed and flickered\nLike a glancing kingfisher,\nOr, in the sun-filled amber,\nThe kite with broad wings spread,\nOr little fluttering doves that pecked\nA golden bunch of dates:\nAnd then of these in settings of fine gold\nMade fillets, rings and ear-rings.\n\nThus, one day,\nDreaming, as ever, of the Queen,\nI wrought a golden serpent for her hair:\nAnd when I brought it to the King, next morn,\nWhere he sat brooding over chess,\nHe bade me bear it to the Queen, myself,\nAnd so, I went unto her, where she sat,\nAmong her singing maidens, at the loom,\nWeaving a silken web of Tyrian dye.\nI laid the trinket at her feet, in silence:\nAnd she arose, and set it in her hair,\nWhose living lustre far outshone\nThe cold, dead metal I had fashioned,\nAs she stood before me, dreaming,\nIn her robe of flowing blue;\nThen looked a moment on me with kind eyes.\nAnd though she spoke no word,\nI turned, and fled, in trembling,\nBefore the light that shivered through me,\nAnd struck my soul with shuddering ecstasy:\nAnd, still, through many days,\nAlthough I did not look again\nUpon those dreaming eyes,\nTheir visionary light\nWithin my soul, revealed eternity.\n\nThus, have the mortal years\nFlowed onward to the perfect end--\nThis day of days,\nThat never night shall quench,\nNor darkness vanquish:\nAnd, at dawn,\nI die.\n\nAnd yet, this morning, as I slowly climbed\nThe steep, ascending stages\nThat lead up to the hanging-gardens--\nWhere, tier on tier,\nThe great brick arches bore\nTheir April wealth of blossoms,\nPlumed with palm and dusky cypress--\nI little knew that I\nWho came to carve a garland\nRound a fountain's porphry basin,\nShould scale so soon the utmost peak of life.\nThroughout the morn I toiled,\nUntil an hour ere noon--\nFor no one, save the King and Queen,\nMay walk in those high gardens, after midday--\nWhen, underneath a cypress shade,\nI paused, a moment, resting;\nAnd looking down upon the basking city,\nBeneath me slumbering deeply--\nGarden on garden glowing, grove on grove,\nLike some green fabric, shot with myriad hues,\nAnd chequered with white clusters of flat roofs,\nAquiver in clear heat:\nAnd then I gazed up through the aching azure,\nAt the restless kites that hover\nEver over Babylon:\nAnd, as I watched one broad-winged bird that hung\nAbove the seven-coloured pyramid\nOf Bel's great temple,\nWith wide pinions spread,\nAs though it kept eternal vigil over\nThe golden image in the golden shrine,\nI thought of eagles poised\nAbove the peaks of glittering snows,\nBeyond the Eastern plains.\nHalf-dreaming, thus, I lay,\nLulled by the tinkling waters,\nTill, unawares, sleep slowly overcame me;\nAnd noonday drifted by:\nAnd still, I slept, unheeding:\nAnd, in my sleep,\nI looked on Beauty in a quiet place\nOf forest gloom and immemorial dream:\nWhen, something rousing me from slumber,\nWith waking eyes that yet seemed dream-enchanted,\nI looked upon the Queen,\nWhere, in a secret close,\nSet thickly round with screens of yew and ilex,\nShe stood upon the dark, broad brim\nOf a wide granite basin, gazing down,\nWith dreaming eyes, into the glooming cool,\nUnraimented, save of the flickering gleam,\nReflected from the lucent waters,\nThat flowed before her silently:\nAnd slowly, from her feet,\nThe cold light rippled up her body, till,\nEntangled in the meshes of her hair,\nIt flooded the calm rapture of her face:\nWhen, dreaming still, she lifted up her eyes,\nUnseeing; and I looked upon her soul,\nUnveiled, in naked immortality,\nUntrammelled by the trappings of brief time,\nAnd cloaks of circumstance.\nHow long I looked upon the perfect beauty,\nI cannot tell--\nEach moment, flowing to eternity,\nBearing me further from time's narrow shores;\nThough, yet, a little while,\nFrom those unshadowed deeps time sought to hold me.\n\nSuddenly, I felt\nA ghostly arrow pierce my life;\nAnd I leapt up, and turning,\nI saw the King beside me,\nWith steely, glittering eyes\nShooting barbed anger,\nThough he coldly spake,\nWith evil, curling lips:\n\"Slave, thou art dead!\"\nAnd yet I did not quail:\nBut, looking 'twixt his brows,\nI answered: and he blenched before my words:\n\"Nay!  I have seen:\n\"And am newborn, a King!\"\nAnd then his craven fingers\nWent quaking to his wagging beard,\nAs if he felt my clutch upon his throat:\nYet, though, with one quick blow,\nI might have hurled him down to death,\nI never stirred:\nAnd, eyeing me, he summoned\nThe negro-eunuchs, who kept watch below:\nBut I, ere they could spring up the first stage,\nWent forth to meet them;\nAnd they bound my wrists.\n\nAnd so, down from the hills, my life has flowed,\nUntil, at fullest flood, it meets the sea.\nWith calm and unregretful heart, I wait\nTill dawn shall loose the arrow from the bow.\nI, who, with eager, faltering hand have sought\nTo fashion a little beauty, in the end,\nHave looked on the perfect beauty, and I die--\nEven as the priest, who, in the heart of night,\nTrembling before the thunder-riven shrine,\nLooks on the face of God, and perishes.\nI die...\nAnd yet, maybe, when earth lies heavily\nUpon the time-o'ertoppled towers,\nAnd tumbled walls, and broken gates of brass;\nAnd the winds whisper one another:\n\"Where, Oh! where is Babylon?\"\nIn the dim underworld of dreaming shades,\nMy soul shall seek out beauty\nAnd look, once more,\nUpon the unveiled vision...\nAnd not die.\n\nNight passes: and already in the court,\nAmid the plash of fountains,\nThere sounds the pad of naked feet approaching.\nWith slow, deliberate pace,\nAs though they trod out all my perished years,\nThe Nubians come, to lead me out to death.\nSlowly the great door opens;\nAnd clearer comes the call of waters;\nCool airs are on my brow ...\nLo! ... in the East, the dawn.\n\n\n\n          LONDON: PRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED.",
