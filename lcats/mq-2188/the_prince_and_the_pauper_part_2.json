    "body": "By his own request our small friend was now conducted to his private\ncabinet, and left there alone to his own devices.  Hanging upon hooks in\nthe oaken wainscoting were the several pieces of a suit of shining steel\narmour, covered all over with beautiful designs exquisitely inlaid in\ngold.  This martial panoply belonged to the true prince--a recent present\nfrom Madam Parr the Queen. Tom put on the greaves, the gauntlets, the\nplumed helmet, and such other pieces as he could don without assistance,\nand for a while was minded to call for help and complete the matter, but\nbethought him of the nuts he had brought away from dinner, and the joy it\nwould be to eat them with no crowd to eye him, and no Grand Hereditaries\nto pester him with undesired services; so he restored the pretty things\nto their several places, and soon was cracking nuts, and feeling almost\nnaturally happy for the first time since God for his sins had made him a\nprince.  When the nuts were all gone, he stumbled upon some inviting\nbooks in a closet, among them one about the etiquette of the English\ncourt.  This was a prize. He lay down upon a sumptuous divan, and\nproceeded to instruct himself with honest zeal.  Let us leave him there\nfor the present.",
