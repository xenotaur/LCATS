    "body": "\"We're in a hell of a jam, Brek,\" the Councillor said. \"If Sagginer\nisn't stopped, he'll change history. The situation's desperate.\"\n\nTime Patrolman Brek Halliday nodded in agreement. It _was_ a tense\nsituation. Time travel, he knew, was possible only so long as the\ntraveller into the past did nothing that would change history\nsignificantly; the time-stream itself would straighten out little\nchanges in the past so that overall history would remain the same.\n\nBut a big change was something else again. If you stick your finger in\na river, there are a few ripples around it, but the flow of the river\nremains the same. If you build a dam, though....\n\n\"_When_ is he?\" Brek asked. \"Do we know?\"\n\n\"Fortunately, yes. He forced one of our operators to use one of the\nchronokinetic projectors, and then kidnapped her and took her with him.\nBut he didn't know that the power drain was measurable and had been\nrecorded on the meters. We know how much energy he used, so we know how\nfar into the past he went. We've got him pinpointed in the area of the\nold United States, somewhere between 1880 and 1895.\"\n\n\"Who was the girl he kidnapped?\" Brek asked.\n\nThe Councillor smiled apologetically. \"Dori Clayton.\"\n\nThe muscles of Halliday's jaw tightened. \"I see,\" he said stiffly.\n\"When do I leave?\"\n\n\"We'll prepare you immediately. It's going to be a touchy job to get\nboth of them out of there, so watch yourself.\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" Halliday said quietly. \"I'll manage it.\" He walked out,\neyes hot with rage, thinking of Dori in Sagginer's clutches. His hands\nslowly clenched and unclenched as he headed down the long hall.\n\n\n\nA Time Patrolman's first step in any excursion to the past is to learn\nthe language and the history so well that he can pass as a native. For\nthree days, Brek Halliday lay in the padded tank of a hypnorobot while\ninformation was poured into him.\n\nThen he was given his clothes. They consisted of a pair of high-heeled\nboots made of treated animal skin, a pair of tight trousers woven\nof blue-dyed vegetable fiber, a shirt of similar material, and a\nbroad-brimmed hat. Other clothing and equipment went into a pack, and\na money-belt around Brek's waist carried gold coins that not even an\nexpert could have told from the originals.\n\nThe thing that Brek liked best was the fact that he would be allowed to\ncarry weapons openly. Some civilizations of the past didn't permit a\ncitizen to carry guns, but where Brek was going, a man with a pair of\nsix-guns at his hips wouldn't look odd at all.\n\nBrek had ridden a horse three times--once in the Battle of Agincourt,\nonce at Chickamaugua, and once during a trip from Rome to Ravenna in\nthe Sixth Century. His fourth horse was saddled a little differently,\nbut he found it easy to handle. He trotted it onto the platform and\nsignalled the operator. There was a brief hum as the chronokinetic\nprojector warmed up. Then there was a sudden surge of power.\n\nBrek's surroundings seemed to vanish into greyness.\n\nMoments later, light swirled around him....\n\n\n\nPlata City, New Mexico, was enjoying a warm, lazy summer day. No one\npaid much attention to the stranger who came into town on a very\nordinary-looking cayuse, pulled up before the Casa Loma Saloon, and\ndismounted. He hitched his horse to the rail, looked up and down the\nstreet casually, and then strode into the saloon.\n\n\"What'll it be, mister?\" asked the fat, mustachioed bartender.\n\n\"Whiskey,\" Brek said. \"And a little cold beer to follow it. That road\nfrom El Paso is hot.\"\n\nThe barman filled the order. \"El Paso, eh? That's a right smart ride.\nBeen on the road long?\"\n\n\"'Bout a week. I don't believe in rushin' nothin'.\"\n\n\"Hey, barkeep!\" yelled someone down at the far end. The bartender went,\nand Brek downed his whiskey. He sipped the beer reflectively, thinking\nlong and hard.\n\nJon Sagginer had been convicted once for illegal use of a time machine,\nand had been sentenced to ten years on Luna. Somehow, he'd managed to\nescape and, by bluff and daring, actually get control of a Time Patrol\nChronokinetic Projector long enough to use it and kidnap the operator,\nDori Clayton.\n\nIt was bad enough to use the machine, Brek thought darkly, but to take\nDori--\n\nBrek clenched his fists. For kidnapping Dori, Sagginer would take his\npunishment from Brek, not the law.\n\nThe first thing to do was find him. Reading the power flow of a\nChronokinetic Projector could only give an approximate location.\nSagginer had landed within fifty miles of this spot, and at some time\nwithin the past five years--but where was he now?\n\nAnd, Brek asked himself--did he still have Dori with him? _Five years\nis a long time._\n\nIn the course of a year or two, Sagginer could be a long way from Plata\nCity, but Brek had a hunch that this was his goal. He didn't know he\ncould be traced, and he wasn't prepared for travel.\n\nBut--\n\nSuddenly, a finger tapped his shoulder and he whirled in surprise. He\nsaw a man wearing a big silver star prominently on his vest.\n\n\"Stranger, you'll have to shuck them irons. City ordinance says a man\ncan't carry pistols inside the city limits.\"\n\n\"I notice I ain't the only one with a full gunbelt,\" Brek said slowly.\n\nThe man's eyes narrowed. \"Them happens to be John Sager's men, mister,\nand they all happen to be deputies.\" His pistol came out suddenly. \"I'm\norderin' you to take 'em off.\"\n\nBrek shrugged and unbuckled the belt.\n\n\"I ain't lookin' for an argument,\" he said, handing the gunbelt to the\nsheriff. But as the sheriff reached for the belt, Brek lashed out with\none hand, slapping the other's weapon aside. It skittered across the\nfloor as Brek jerked one of his own guns from the belt and sent the\nsheriff reeling backward with a blow in the chest.\n\nSeveral of the other armed men started to reach for their hips, but\nBrek's icy voice stopped them short. \"First man to touch a gun gets\nlead!\"\n\nThe sheriff's face grew red. \"You've got trouble, stranger.\"\n\n\"Maybe. But them guns is mine.\"\n\n\"You're trying to buck the law,\" said the sheriff.\n\nBrek grinned. \"It's a damn fool law that needs so many men to enforce\nit. If you was the only one packin' irons, I might be persuaded to\ngie 'em to the barkeep here. But as long as everybody is carryin'\nfull holsters, I reckon I don't want to be out of style. I'd look too\nconspicuous.\"\n\nStill holding his weapon, he buckled on his belt and walked over to\nwhere the sheriff's gun had fallen. Without taking his eyes off of\nanyone in the room, he squatted and picked it up.\n\nThen he walked back to the sheriff and shoved the six-gun into the\nlawman's holster. \"Don't aim to cause no trouble, sheriff. If you and\nthe rest of these gents will oblige me, I'll ask the barkeep to set us\nall up a drink.\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence, then the sheriff grinned.\n\n\"Reckon I'll take whiskey,\" he said.\n\nBrek grinned back and put his weapon in its sheath.\n\nIt was almost a mistake. As soon as his hand was well away from the gun\nbutt, one of the men at the bar snatched at his six-gun and brought it\nup to fire.\n\n\n\nNo ordinary man with ordinary guns could have moved fast enough to\ndo anything. But Brek was no ordinary man, and his weapons were far\nfrom ordinary; both man and guns were the product of a science far in\nadvance of the nineteenth century.\n\nBrek's hands blurred, and his weapons seemed to leap from their\nholsters as the little robot mechanisms secreted in their butts\nresponded to the electroneural commands of their owner.\n\nThere was a roar of sound as one of the guns spoke.\n\nThe gunman's weapon seemed to vanish from his hand. It sailed across\nthe room, banged against the wall, and dropped to the floor. Brek had\nno compunction against killing a man, particularly in self-defense,\nbut the death of one man might conceivably make radical changes in the\nfuture.\n\nAs the echoes of the gunshot died away, the gunman howled with pain.\nThe shock of Brek's bullet against the gun had sent needles of pain\nracing up his arm.\n\nThe room was silent. Then the sheriff walked over to the gunman, who\nwas massaging his aching, numbed fingers, and grabbed him by the shirt\ncollar.\n\nHe said softly, \"When I agree to take a drink with a man, I don't take\nit lightly when one of my deputies tries to shoot him.\"\n\n\"I figured you wanted to take him after what he had done,\" the man said\nsullenly.\n\n\"If I had, I'd of done my own gunslinging.\" He reached out and yanked\nthe small metal star off the man's vest. \"You ain't a deputy any more.\nIf I catch you wearin' guns, I'll run you in--or shoot you, whichever's\nhandiest.\"\n\nStill holding his injured hand, the man turned and walked out of the\nsaloon. The sheriff turned around to Brek.\n\n\"That was mighty fast and accurate shootin', son. What'd you say your\nname was?\"\n\n\"I didn't say yet,\" Brek said, reholstering his weapons. \"But as a\nmatter of fact, it's Ed Calhoun. As I said, I don't want to cause no\ntrouble, but I'm glad to oblige them that comes lookin' for it.\" He\nlaid a ten-dollar gold piece on the bar. \"Here's an eagle, barkeep.\nLet's have them drinks.\"\n\nOne of the other men at the bar looked quizzically at the sheriff.\n\"Sheriff, maybe you hadn't ought to of done that to Cactus. How's the\nboss gonna take it?\"\n\nThe sheriff looked at him for a moment. Then he looked at the others.\n\"Let's get one thing straight here. John Sager's an important man\nhereabouts, and I don't deny it. He needs good gunslingers to guard his\nproperty, and I'm only too glad to deputize 'em. But, by the Almighty,\nif a man don't behave himself, if he ain't to be trusted with a gun,\nthen he ain't goin' to wear a badge as long as I'm sheriff.\"\n\nHe turned to Brek. \"I got to uphold the law, son. I asked you to turn\nthem guns in and you wouldn't do it. I'm damned if I'm goin' to' try\nto take 'em away, so there's only one thing to do.\" He handed Brek the\nstar that he had taken from Cactus. \"Hold up your right hand,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHalf an hour later, Brek found himself sitting at a table, drinking\nbeer and talking with the sheriff and a man named Chuck. He'd answered\nquestions about his past with the purely fictitious data that he'd\nreceived from the hypnorobot, but all the time his mind had been on the\nman who was \"an important man hereabouts\"--John Sager.\n\n_Sager. Sagginer._ It could be the same man.\n\n\"By the way, Sheriff--who _is_ John Sager?\"\n\n\"Owns the bank,\" the sheriff said. \"Got property up on Chloride Flats,\ntoo. That's the silver mine district, you know. Bought out a couple of\nmen who was failin' in business and then put 'em to work managin' their\nown stores for him. People around here have a right smart respect for\nhim.\"\n\n\"Friendly sort of fella, eh?\"\n\n\"Well, I wouldn't go so far as to say that. He treats people well,\ngives money to the church and the school, gives a man a job if he's\ndown and out, but I wouldn't say he was a likeable man personally.\"\n\n\"He's odd,\" said Chuck. \"A real queer one. Maybe I shouldn't say it\nbecause I work for him, and he's done real proper by me, but--well,\nhe's a funny one.\"\n\nBrek raised an eyebrow. \"Yeah--How?\"\n\n\"Well, for one thing, he seems so--well, _cold_. Like he was a\nside-winder or a rattlesnake waitin' for a packrat to come by. He\nalways seems to be figurin'--calculatin'. He don't smile much, and when\nhe does, it don't look right on him.\"\n\n\"That funny accent of his don't help none,\" the sheriff chimed in. \"It\nain't that he can't speak good English, but it sounds funny, the way he\nsays it.\"\n\n\"Been here very long?\" Brek asked casually.\n\n\"'Bout three years, is all. Done right well by himself, considerin' he\ndidn't have much when he came.\"\n\nChuck said: \"After bein' robbed and all, it's a caution how he done so\nwell.\" Then he laughed. \"That was downright funny, when you come to\nthink of it.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" the sheriff said, grinning. \"Him and his sister showed up one\nnight, naked as jaybirds. A couple of owlhoots had robbed 'em and\nstripped 'em of everything they had. No horse, no clothes, no nothin'.\nHe was lucky, in a way, though. He had a money-belt on him that he\nmanaged to hide in a mesquite bush while the bandits wasn't lookin'.\n\n\"I was sittin' in my office that night, when I heard a knock at the\nback door. I opened it, and there was John Sager, all dressed up in his\nbirthday suit and nothin' more. Course, I didn't know who he was--\"\n\nBrek listened closely to the sheriff's story. It all fits in. Sagginer\nhadn't had time to prepare himself for this era; his speech was\nstrange, and his clothes even stranger. So he'd taken off his clothes\nand pretended to have been robbed. And his sister?\n\n\"What's his sister like?\" he asked.\n\n\"Pretty,\" Chuck said, \"but she's not too bright. Goes around in a daze\nmost of the time.\"\n\n_Hypnotized!_ Brek thought. That settled it.\n\n\n\nTwenty-four hours later, Brek had all the information he needed.\n\nSagginer had a double plot in mind--one which would both set him up\npermanently and at the same time eliminate any danger from the Time\nPatrol. Sagginer knew, of course, where the Great Silver Vein was\nat Chloride Flats. It wasn't due to be discovered until 1973, but if\n\"Sager\" found it, he'd not only be a rich man--he would so change\nhistory that the Time Patrol would be unable to reach him. He would\ndivert the time-stream radically by the discovery of such a vast amount\nof silver.\n\nBrek had presumably spent the night at the Murray Hotel, but he had\nactually slipped out of his room unseen and made an excursion on foot\nup Palo Alto Mountain to the big house Sager had erected there.\n\nIt was tightly guarded. There would be no chance of getting in there\nwithout creating a major disturbance. Cautiously, he crept completely\naround the house, looking for a break in the guard network. There\nwasn't any.\n\nIn order to get inside, he'd have to get himself invited in. But how?\n\nHe returned to the Hotel, headed from there to the Casa Loma, and was\nsitting in the bar drinking a beer, mulling the problem over, when\nChuck came in.\n\n\"Ed,\" the slim man said softly, \"it really ain't none of my business,\nbut I thought you ought to know that Cactus is gunnin' for you.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Chuck,\" Brek said, as Chuck walked over to the other end of\nthe bar, as if not wanting to be seen with Brek.\n\nIt was easy to see what had happened. Cactus had told Sager-Sagginer\nwhat had happened in the bar yesterday, including, no doubt, the story\nabout the blinding draw from the hip. Sager probably suspected that\nBrek was a Time Patrolman and had sent Cactus to shoot him.\n\nBrek moistened his lips, got up, and dropped a coin on the bar. Then\nhe tipped his hat to Chuck and pushed his way through the batwings,\nheading for Sager's bank.\n\nHe knew the game. Sager didn't care whether Cactus got killed or not;\nwhat he wanted to do was watch Brek's gunwork, which would give him\naway as a Patrolman if he depended on the robot pistols.\n\nBrek would have to take a chance.\n\nHe reached down and turned off the robot armament. All he had now was\na pair of ordinary pistols. Overhead, the noonday sun was coming down\nstrong and hard, and he began to sweat.\n\nCasually, he sauntered down the wide, unpaved street toward the bank.\nThere were a few people strolling idly in the other direction. He moved\nup against the row of shops, looking in all directions.\n\nNo sign of Cactus. He frowned. Brek knew of Cactus' fear of his\nlightning draw, and suspected that Cactus would try an ambush. Brek\nglanced uneasily across the street, over at Bishop's Livery, where a\ncowpoke was hitching his reins to the rail. It wasn't Cactus.\n\nThen, suddenly, a gun spoke. Brek felt a hot bolt of lead blast its way\ninto his arm, and he staggered dizzily. He glanced up as he struggled\nto regain his balance, and saw gunsmoke drifting out an open window in\nthe second floor of Sager's Bank. _Cactus_, he thought. He leaped back\nas another bullet raked the dirt near him. His left arm was warm with\nhis own blood.\n\nThe street was silent. Brek leaned against the cool glass of a shop\nwindow, waiting, holding his breath.\n\nIn a few minutes, a head peered cautiously out the second-story window.\nBrek tugged at his gun--it seemed to take forever to get it out with\nthe robot armament shut off--and fired once.\n\nA man tumbled out the window, bounced off the awning in front of the\nbuilding, and dropped heavily to the ground. He lay still.\n\nBrek mopped the blood from his arm. His head was starting to swim with\npain, and new worries assailed him. He had killed a man, now. Would it\nchange the past? Would he ever reach Dori again? He didn't know. All he\nknew was the blinding pain in his arm.\n\n\n\nHe was in fairly good repair an hour later, though the arm still\nthrobbed a bit. He'd taken it to a local doctor; Sagginer would\nbe suspicious if he'd used Quik-Heal on it. He stood in front of\nthe Murray Hotel, methodically packing his few belongings into his\nsaddlebags.\n\nChuck walked up. \"Ed, the boss would like to see you. Sager.\"\n\n\"Sager? What does _he_ want?\"\n\n\"Wants to apologize for what Cactus done. He fired Cactus as soon as\nhe heard about the run-in with the sheriff, so he wants you to know he\nain't responsible. Cactus had no business layin' for you from that bank\nwindow.\"\n\nBrek shrugged. \"Might as well go,\" he said. \"I never figured Sager was\nbehind it anyway.\"\n\nHe headed to the bank. Sager was sitting behind his desk, flanked by a\ncouple of his gunmen. He was a lean, long-nosed man with cold eyes and\na narrow, thin-lipped mouth.\n\n\"You are Ed Calhoun?\"\n\nBrek nodded.\n\n\"I want you to know that I am sorry for what my ex-employee did. I do\nnot like that sort of thing.\" Sager's speech was stiff and formal, Brek\nnoted.\n\n\"I figured he was on his own,\" he said easily. \"I didn't know of\nnothin' you might have against me.\"\n\n\"There is nothing, I assure you. I understand you are leaving Plata\nCity.\"\n\n\"Yep. I'm headin' for Arizona--cattle country. I'm a cowman by trade.\"\n\n\"You are also a very good man with a gun. I need men like you. How\nwould you like to work for me?\"\n\n_It had worked_, Brek thought exultantly. Pretending to be about to\nleave town had removed all suspicion from Sagginer's mind.\n\n\"Why, I reckon I might stay if the pay was good,\" Brek said\nthoughtfully. \"Long as a man makes a livin', it don't matter much\n_what_ he does.\"\n\n\"I will make it well worth your while, Mr. Calhoun.\"\n\nBrek drew his breath in sharply, fighting the temptation to shoot Sager\nwhere he sat. It would eradicate one considerable blotch on the human\nrace, but it would also involve killing others and it still wouldn't\nget Dori out of that house.\n\n\"Reckon I'll listen to your proposition, anyhow, Mr. Sager.\"\n\n\n\nIt was three days before Brek was asked up to the house. He knew his\ntime was running low. If Sager actually started mining operations on\nhis property, his death or disappearance wouldn't stop it. Someone\nelse would find the Great Silver Vein, and the time-stream would be\nunalterably diverted, causing incalculable change in the world of the\nfuture.\n\nBrek's opening was a lucky one--a prowler had been caught, a Mexican\nitinerant shot and killed by a guard. It had apparently scared Sager,\nwho probably suspected the Mexican might have been a Time Patrolman,\nand so he had decided to increase the guard around his house. Brek was\ncalled from his bank duties and taken up Palo Alto Mountain to the\nSager mansion. His job was to patrol the grounds.\n\nThat evening, as dusk fell, Brek strolled around the grounds, going\nfrom one of the posted guards to another.\n\n\"Sam? It's me, Ed.\"\n\n\"Howdy, Ed. Seen anything?\"\n\n\"Not a thing. You?\"\n\n\"Nope. I think the boss is just jumpy.\"\n\nBrek poured tobacco into a cigarette paper, rolled it deftly, and put\nit in his mouth. \"Got a light, Sam?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\nAs the guard struck the match, Brek leaned forward to light his\ncigarette--and, at the same time, he put his hand on the other's\nshoulder. Automatically, a little device in his palm silently and\npainlessly injected hypnotene into the man's blood stream.\n\nAfter a moment, Brek said: \"How do you feel, Sam?\"\n\nSam blinked slowly. \"Just fine.\"\n\n\"You'll do anything I tell you--won't you, Sam?\"\n\n\"Why sure, Ed. Whatever you say.\"\n\nBrek grinned savagely. \"You won't hear any noise from the house.\"\n\n\"No noise from the house,\" Sam agreed.\n\n\"No matter what happens, you won't hear anything out of the ordinary,\nor see anything out of the ordinary. This will seem just like any other\nnight to you.\"\n\nUnder the influence of the drug, Sam nodded in agreement.\n\n\"And you won't remember what I just said. All you'll remember is that I\nbummed a light and went on.\"\n\nAgain Sam nodded.\n\n\"Well, so long, Sam.\"\n\n\"So long, Ed,\" said Sam tonelessly.\n\nThe same process, with variations, was repeated with the rest of the\nguards. When he was finished, Brek fired his gun into the air and\nstrode boldly up to the front door. He rapped.\n\n\"Who is there?\" asked a voice from within.\n\n\"Ed Calhoun, Boss. We just killed another prowler. You want to take a\nlook at him?\"\n\nA pause. Then, \"Are you sure he is dead?\"\n\n\"Bullet through his head,\" Brek said.\n\n\"What does he look like?\"\n\n\"Ordinary. Might be an Indian.\"\n\nThe door opened, and Sager stepped straight into a right upper-cut\nwhich bowled him back through the opening. Brek charged in after him,\nbut the man lay limp, his eyes closed.\n\nBrek stood over him for a moment, debating what to do. Then he heard\nfootsteps on the stairway.\n\n_Dori._\n\nShe stared at him, no recognition in her eyes. A chill of horror ran\nthrough him as he saw what Dori had become.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Her voice was dull, uncaring.\n\nHe walked over to her and looked at her eyes. Burning fury rose in him.\nUsing hypnotene, Sagginer had made Dori only the shell of the girl he\nhad loved.\n\n\"Who are you?\" she asked again. \"I do not know you.\"\n\n\"You once did,\" he said tightly. \"You--\"\n\nHe felt a sudden blow on the back of his neck, and his knees sagged.\nSager had been feigning unconsciousness, and now had returned to the\nstruggle at a moment when Brek was unprepared.\n\nA fist smashed into his side, and he ducked away, blinking away\nthe pain. He turned and advanced toward Sagginer, while Dori moaned\nwordlessly in the corner.\n\nSagginer jumped forward and drove a fist toward Brek's jaw, but Brek\ncountered and felt knuckles crash through the time-jumper's teeth.\nAs Sagginer rocked, Brek hit him below the heart, and he grunted and\nfolded up.\n\nThis time Brek made sure of the job. He continued pummelling Sagginer's\nsenseless body until he was out of breath, then stood up and looked at\nDori.\n\nShe was huddled helplessly in a chair, sobbing in terror. Brek scowled\nas he remembered the girl he had once known, and gave the unconscious\nform of Sagginer another kick. Then he slid his gun out of its holster\nand pressed a button on the underside of the robot gunbelt.\n\nThe time-scoop closed around the three of them.\n\n\n\nWhen the greyness cleared away, Brek stumbled out of the time-scoop and\nsaw the Councillor waiting for him, smiling.\n\nHe shook his head to clear it. \"Here I am,\" he said. \"And here's your\ntime snatcher. Mission accomplished, sir.\"\n\n\"Very fine job, Brek. Very fine.\"\n\nBrek looked at the Councillor. \"There's one problem, though. The girl,\nDori--\"\n\nHe saw the Councillor blink apprehensively. \"Oh, I brought her back,\nall right,\" he said quickly. \"But--but--she's been badly treated, sir.\nI don't know if the damage Sagginer's done to her mind can ever be\nrepaired. I--\"\n\nThe Councillor's eyes widened. \"What are you talking about, Brek? What\nhas happened to Dori? I'm afraid I don't understand what you mean.\"\n\n\"Why, she's right here--unconscious, in the back of the Time-Scoop,\"\nBrek said, puzzled. \"And--\" He turned to find the girl. \"Why--she\n_isn't_ here!\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said the Councillor. \"She's been right here, all the\ntime. Where else should she be?\"\n\nDimly, Brek began to realize what had happened. Some act of his--the\nshooting of Cactus, perhaps--had altered the future, his present, ever\nso slightly. Just enough so that in _this_ present, Sagginer had gone\nback alone--_without_ Dori.\n\nA door opened, and a girl stepped out, clad in a white lab smock. Her\neyes were bright and clear, and when she saw Brek, she gave a little\nscream of joy.\n\nThen Brek folded her into his arms.",
