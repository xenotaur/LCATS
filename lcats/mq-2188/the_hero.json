    "body": "Two months after the landing, Ship UXB-69311 was rigged out with most\nthings needed to make life bearable, if not interesting, for the crew.\nPerched on the manicured, blue-green sod of the planet Engraham, its\ninner parts were transformed and refitted for the many months of the\nExploration. No effort and no flight of imagination had been spared to\nmake the ship resemble more a country club than a barracks. With the\npermission of Colonel Mondrain, the crew's bunkroom had been completely\nrearranged, and a segment thereof made into a quietly elegant bar. Plans\nfor this eventual rejuvenation had been fomenting throughout the very\ntiresome and very monotonous journey.\n\nWhen they first landed, the natives fled, and thus it was easy to\nliberate furnishings from the adjacent village. When the inhabitants\nreturned, after the purposes of the visiting Earthman were acknowledged\nto be harmless, they proved to be too courteous to carp about a few\nmissing articles.\n\nThe chairs, of a very advanced design and most comfortable, were made of\na light and durable metal alloy thus far unknown to Earth. The bar\n(which was probably not its purpose on Engraham, no one knew or cared\nwhat its function had been) was of a design so futuristic that it would\nhave turned a modern artist mad. The utensils, also liberated, were\nunbelievably delicate, yet strong and easy to wash. At first, since the\nEarth had not intended the Exploration to resemble the type that\nTexas-stationed servicemen like to run in Matamoros, there was nothing\nto drink in the utensils. But hardly six weeks had passed before the\nfirst hero of the Exploration, a man named O'Connors, discovered a\npalatable fruit growing on nearby bushes. By means of a system of\nimprovised pipes (also liberated) it was no time at all before tasty\nbeverages, somewhat strident but quite effective, were being run off and\nconsumed in quantities. The machine known as O'Connors Joy-Juicer was\nconcealed behind the bar, and all that was ever seen on the bar when\nColonel Mondrain or the Doctors were around was an innocuous fruit\njuice.\n\nThe Earth Command had stocked the ship with reading material, most of it\nof a disgustingly educational nature, in photostatic cards: and the\nsecond hero of the Exploration was a man named Kosalowsky, who\ndiscovered in the psychology sections the works of Freud and\nKrafft-Ebing. After this discovery, a few interesting discussions arose.\n\nAfter these changes had been made, there was very little to do.\n\nThe Earth Command had assumed that the natives of Engraham would resent\nthe Explorations (most planets did), and so had sent along the crew of\nthirty men for protection. All had labored mightily to become part of\nthis special crew, chosen for endurance and known war-like qualities.\nFor once they got back to Earth, all were slated to be mustered out of\nservice immediately, decorated to the ears, and awarded full, life-time\npensions. Many already had contracts to appear on television and one\nman, Blunt, hinted at a long term Hollywood contract.\n\nBut once they got there, there was little to do after all. A guard was\nposted; instruments were checked; and, although the necessity seemed\nslight, the ship was kept primed for instantaneous emergency take-off.\nOn the day corresponding to Earth's Saturday, the ship was G. I.'d from\nstem to stern. The maintenance crew made sure that no parts deteriorated\nor got liberated by enterprising natives. But the natives were not an\ninventive race. It was discovered by the Doctors (Anker, Frank, Pelham\nand Flandeau) that the natives literally did not know how to steal. They\nwere backward. Dr. Flandeau, who was making great strides with the\nlanguage, reported that there was some evidence that the Engrahamites\nhad once possessed this skill, along with murder, mayhem, bad faith, and\npolitics, but had lost it, through a deterioration of the species.\n\nThus, once the ship had been transformed into a place worthy of human\ndwelling, and the beverage question had been solved, and utter,\nimbecilic boredom circumvented by the timely discoveries of Freud and\nKrafft-Ebing, the men found time hanging heavily on their hands; and the\nmore the doctors discovered about the Engrahamites, the more dismal the\nsituation became. The doctors, growing more and more fascinated by their\ntasks, left the ship bright and early each day, returning around\nnightfall to reduce their growing stacks of data to points of Earthly\nrelevance. The Colonel was also out most of the time. He paid many\nsocial calls on the natives, who, being courteous, received him, and was\noften returned at night in a chauffeured native Hop-Hop. Life in the\nbunkroom became a sullen round of poker, reading of Krafft-Ebing, and\ngab: and Earth currency changed hands daily in the never-ending crap\ngame.\n\nFor there was one great lack in their lives. This lack, and the\ninability to do anything about it, absorbed many hours of conversation.\nAt first, complaints only occurred at intervals; but as weeks passed,\nthe lamentations became so fervent, so constant, and so heart-rending,\nthat Dr. Flandeau observed to Dr. Frank that more stirring passages had\nnot been made since the Jeremiad. For Dr. Flandeau, although aging, was\nin his off hours a poet, and a Frenchman always.\n\nDr. Frank said, \"Yes, well, poor bastards.\"\n\nAt first, nostalgically, the crew harked back to happier times on Earth.\nSoon not one young lady of their collective acquaintance had escaped the\nmost minute analysis. They were young men--the oldest, Blunt, was only\ntwenty-six--and several of them had married young, greatly limiting\ntheir activities so that even their cumulative memories could not last\nforever. After several weeks, repetition began to set in. Once all\nsuccesses had been lovingly remembered, down to the last, exquisite\ndetail, they began recalling their failures. The master strategist, the\nunofficial referee of these seminars, was Dick Blunt.\n\n\"Now where you went wrong there,\" he would tell a fledgling reporting\ncomplete zero with a YWCA resident, \"was in making her feel that you\nwere interested. Your line with a girl like that should be one of\ncharity. Pure charity. You impress on her that you're doing her a\nterrific favor. You offer to bring to her dull life romance, adventure,\ntenderness.\"\n\n\"I couldn't even get my hands on her,\" complained the reproved failure,\nHerbert Banks.\n\n\"I've always found that type the easiest ones of all,\" Blunt said\nindifferently. \"Dull, of course.\"\n\nThe testiness, the self-pity, the shortness of temper and the near-riots\nover stolen packages of cigarettes, were not improved after the Doctors,\nhaving surveyed the situation thoroughly, decided that it would do no\nharm to let the men of the crew go out on Liberty.\n\nFraternizing with natives was, of course, strictly forbidden. They were\nnot to drink off premises. (Nor on, for that matter.) They were exhorted\nnot to steal, not to engage in fights.\n\nStill, they could walk around, take pictures of the strange pink houses\nand the dazzling cities. They could watch a covey of children swim in\nthe municipal pools. They could look at the fountains, the so-called\n\"miraculous fountains of Engraham\", or climb the strange, glassy\nmountains. The natives, although shy of them, were most polite, and some\nsmiled enchantingly--especially the women.\n\n                                  ----\n\nThis was the worst rub of all: there were women, and they were gorgeous.\nA little smaller than most Earth women, with bright eyes, and high,\narched eyebrows, looking forever as if they had heard the most priceless\njoke. Their faces conformed to the most rigid standards of Caucasian\nbeauty. Their legs, so delicate, so tapering, so fantastically small of\nankle, were breath-taking. Their clothes, which would have driven a\nParisian designer to suicide, were draped carelessly over the most\nexquisite figures. True, they were a little deficient in one department,\nand this was explained, before they were granted liberty, by Dr.\nFlandeau. The women of Engraham, he said, did not bear children.\n\nThis announcement was not received with special gloom, for until then,\nnone of the crew had seen an Engrahamite woman. But Willy Lanham, a\ndark-haired, skinny boy from Tennessee, asked, unhappily, \"Don't they\neven go in for games or nothin'?\"\n\nFlandeau understood instantly. He shook his head sadly. \"I should think\nnot. It has been a long time since they have observed the normal\nfunctions. The women are mainly for decoration, although it is said that\nsome are also created for brains. They are a most strange people.\"\n\nAfter this--granted these agonizing liberties, and able to see that\nwhich was biologically unattainable--the crew became so demoralized that\nnot even Kosalowsky's discovery of the works of Wilhelm Reik relieved\nthe deep gloom.\n\nHowever, they had reckoned without the superior genius of Dick Blunt.\nBlunt received Flandeau's news as unhappily as the others, and, like the\nrest, was made miserable by the sight of the glorious damozels. But he\nwas a reasonable man and he put his reasoning powers to work. Soon he\nalone was cheerful. He went around with the absorbed, other-world look\nof a physicist grappling with a problem in ionospheric mathematics\nwithout the use of an IBM calculator. One day he went on Liberty alone.\nHe did not return until the fall of night, and when he came in his\nelation was so immoderate that the others thought there must be bars on\nEngraham after all.\n\n\"I have found the answer to our question,\" he said.\n\nNo one needed to ask what question. O'Connors hurried to pour Blunt a\ndrink.\n\n\"I have spent the day pursuing this answer logically,\" said Blunt. \"I\nhave done what any thoughtful man would do. I have read up on it.\"\n\n\"How?\" cried Henderson.\n\n\"At the library.\"\n\nBlunt then described his day: finding his way to the library by means of\npantomime; and finding at last, that file of photographs--photographs of\nan utterly self-explanatory nature. And these he pulled from his pocket,\nfor ignoring all discipline, he had stolen them.\n\nThe pictures passed from hand to hand. O'Connors passed them on to Pane,\nand suddenly felt the need to open the window behind him. It was Willy\nLanham, the boy from Tennessee, who voiced those exultant words that\nrose to the throats of all:\n\nHe said, \"Hey! They're made just like the Earth girls.\"\n\nThe conversation, at this intensely interesting point, was cut short by\nthe arrival of the Colonel. He alighted from the native Hop-Hop--waved\ncheerily to its driver, and began coming up. The bottle and glasses\nvanished, and Kosalowsky began to read aloud from a book especially\nreserved for these occasions. The men maintained looks of studious\ninterest as the officer went through. He went up the ladder to his own\nquarters, there to write in his growing volume, THE COMING OCCUPATION\nAND GOVERNMENT OF ENGRAHAM. They listened until his door clicked.\n\nThe conversation was resumed in more subdued tones.\n\n\"Do you think,\" said Pane shakily, \"They still _could_?\"\n\n\"Not a question of it,\" Blunt said. \"These pictures prove it. It's what\nyou might call a lost art. Once upon a time, as with all the fortunate\nparts of the galaxy, this art was known to the Engrahamites. Through\nsome terrific foul-up, they lost it. Probably a combination of the\nscience of incubation, and the reign of some ghastly square, like Queen\nVictoria. Thus were the girls of Engraham deprived of the pleasures of\nlove.\"\n\n\"The men, too,\" said Willy. All glared at him reproachfully. To care\nabout the happiness of the Engrahamite men was thought not quite\npatriotic.\n\n\"Gradually,\" Blunt went on, \"they must have begun to lose interest.\nProbably there was some taboo. In the end they probably all thought, oh,\nto hell with it, and began serving on committees.\"\n\nA long sigh went up.\n\n\"It is for us,\" Blunt said softly, treasuring each word, \"to restore\nthese unhappy maidens to their original human rights.\n\n\"But it isn't going to be easy,\" Blunt went on. His voice dropped even\nlower. \"Think what would happen if it went sour. Those Doctors would get\nwind of it. We'd be stuck in the Ship for the rest of the Exploration.\"\n\nThere was a sober pause. Finally Banks cleared his throat and said,\n\"Well, how do you think it should be handled, Blunt?\"\n\n\"Well, every beachhead needs an invasion,\" Blunt said, casually holding\nout his glass. O'Connors leapt to fill it. \"One guy has got to lay the\ngroundwork. Let him enlighten one quail. Explain things to her.\" He took\na long, leisurely drink, and sighed. \"This quail will rush around\ntelling the others. Pretty soon there'll be so many hanging around the\nship that--\"\n\nThere was a general rush for cooling beverages.\n\n\"Right,\" someone said, when the faculty of speech was recovered.\n\n\"And necessarily,\" said Blunt, \"this has to be the guy with the most\nsavvy. The one who knows the score. The one most likely to succeed.\nCheck?\"\n\nAll knew what this was leading up to. Martin said unhappily, \"Check,\nBlunt, You're our boy.\"\n\n                                  ----\n\nBlunt was scheduled to stand guard the next day, but Willy Lanham, eager\nto assist the cause, volunteered to take over for him. The hours seemed\nto creep by. His air was swaggering and cool when he returned, and all\ngathered round with eager curiosity--all but Lanham, who had not\nrecovered from standing guard.\n\nBlunt sauntered to the bar, accepted a drink, sipped it, lighted a\ncigarette, and took a long, pensive drag. Finally he said reminiscently,\n\"What a doll!\"\n\nPane, never a subtle man, cried in anguish, \"Well, how'd you make out?\"\n\nBlunt smiled smugly. He began his recital. He was walking along the\nstreet and he met this gorgeous creature. A full description followed\n(broken by the arrival of the Colonel and two paragraphs of the DECLINE\nAND FALL) making it clear that this was the dish of dishes, the most\nbeautiful of the beautiful, the most charming, and the most intelligent.\nShe allowed herself to be addressed in Blunt's few words of Engrahamic\nand, smiling ever patiently, sat with him for several hours. Their talk\ntook place in a secluded bower, in one of the many parks. She was\nagreeable and charmed and promised to see him again. He even managed,\nthrough terrific feats of pantomime, to impress on her the need of\nsecrecy in future meetings.\n\n\"That was all?\" someone said, when he finished.\n\n\"For the first meeting, I think I did wonders,\" said Blunt. \"After all,\nsex hasn't been known here since a time corresponding to our Stone Age.\"\n\nLater, when the nightly poker game was beginning, Willy Lanham said,\n\"Why didn't you just make a grab for her?\"\n\n\"That's the hill-billy approach,\" Blunt said disdainfully. \"These girls\nare civilized--very, very civilized. It's important not to shock them.\"\n\n                                  ----\n\nBlunt's next gambit was to set about learning the language. For this he\nwent not to Flandeau, who best knew it, but to Ankers, who was a pure\nscientist in every sense of the word, and not so likely to suspect his\nmotives. The girl proved very cultured. She took him to art galleries,\nto symphonies, and mountain climbing, for scrambling up and down the\nglassy hills was a favorite Engrahamic sport. As he advanced in the\nlanguage, he learned that her name was Catataphinaria, which meant \"she\nwill attain relative wisdom\". He found that she worked for the Eleven\nwho, while not rulers, offered general suggestions which the populace\nmore or less followed.\n\nAlthough his slow progress inevitably bored the crew, still, it offered\nthat one precious ray of hope, and they became so tractable that even\nthe Doctors noticed it. They laid it to the secret ingredient that Dr.\nFrank had introduced into the drinking water.\n\nThe summer wore on, becoming hotter each day. By the end of the second\nmonth of his courtship, Blunt began to speak to her of love.\n\nShe laughed. She said that she had little curiosity on the subject,\nalthough it was now and then mentioned by the students of antiquity.\nAssured that it was pleasurable, she said that she heard that barbarians\nalso enjoyed murdering people and making them butts of jokes.\n\nWilly Lanham said, \"Don't listen to what a girl _says_. Just make a grab\nfor her.\"\n\nThis suggestion was laughed to scorn.\n\nWeeks passed, the summer began to wane. Tempers again began to shorten.\nFlandeau said to Frank, \"The men are worse again.\"\n\n\"Yes, perhaps we should increase the dosage.\"\n\nThe fruits for the Joy-Juicer grew thin on the silvery bushes, and men\nranged far and wide, putting in supplies for the winter.\n\n                                  ----\n\nOne night, when Blunt had won at poker, all the men lay in their bunks,\ntoo dispirited to drink, to shoot craps, almost too miserable even for\nspeech. Blunt again began talking of Catataphinaria. Drowsily Lanham\nsaid, \"I think you're going at it the wrong way, Dick. Try some real\nrough stuff. You know--kiss her. She might like it.\"\n\nBefore Blunt could defend his strategy, Kosalowsky sat up in his bunk.\n\"Yes, for cripes sake,\" he said, \"Move in for the kill. Or shut up about\nit. You're driving us all nuts.\"\n\n\"Would you like to try?\" Blunt suggested softly.\n\n\"Sure I'll try,\" Kosalowsky said. He turned on the light over his bunk.\n\"Give me a crack at her. I could have managed it weeks ago. All you've\ndone is talk to the quail.\"\n\n\"Yah, Dick, maybe you're using the wrong approach on this one,\"\nO'Connors suggested.\n\n\"It's the damn places you take her,\" Kosalowsky said. \"Art galleries.\nAnybody ever seduce a girl in an art gallery? Symphonies. Popping around\nin her damn Hop-Hop. Can't you ever get her alone?\"\n\n\"She lives with ten other girls,\" Blunt said sulkily. \"They're all home\nall the time.\"\n\n\"Well, bring her here, then,\" Pane suggested. \"We'll all take a powder.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\nThere was no answer. They could not all, by day, desert the ship, and it\nwas getting too chilly for the crew to hide in adjacent shrubbery. \"We\ncould put up a wall,\" Pane said suddenly, \"between the bunks and the\nbar.\"\n\n\"With what?\"\n\n\"I know,\" Banks said eagerly, \"where there's a whole pile of stuff. It's\nnice thin metal, just lying there getting rusty.\"\n\n\"I think you're premature--\"\n\n\"Premature!\" Kosalowsky shouted. \"Six months you've been chasing this\ntomato. You call that premature?\"\n\n\"Only four by Engrahamic time,\" Blunt said, insulted.\n\n\"Listen,\" Kosalowsky said, \"that wall goes up tomorrow. And you're\nsmuggling her in tomorrow night. Or else,\" he said, glaring at Blunt,\n\"after that it's every man for himself. Check?\"\n\nBlunt, only slightly seen in the light from Kosalowsky's bunk, was white\nwith rage. \"All right, guys,\" he said stonily. \"I've been trying to do\nright by this frail. Nothing abrupt or hillbilly. Nothing to hurt her\ndelicate feelings or her fine mind. But if this is how you want\nit--Okay!\"\n\n                                  ----\n\nThe next day the wall went up.\n\nHardly a word was said as it was hammered in place. Once up, the place\nwas G. I.'d thoroughly. The ash trays were washed, the floor vacuumed,\nand the lights adjusted to achieve the most tellingly seductive effect.\nBlunt went out at two, thin-lipped and silent.\n\n\"The jerk,\" Kosalowsky said, \"I think he's a lot of hot air. That's what\n_I_ think.\"\n\nThe Colonel came in at nightfall and asked about the wall. They told him\nthat it was to cut off the recreation section from the sleeping\nquarters, for the protection of those who wanted more sleep to prepare\nfor the grueling winter watches.\n\n\"Very good idea men,\" the Colonel said, and went upstairs to write\nanother chapter in his book.\n\nAt nine the men disappeared into their bunks. O'Connors won the\nresponsible job of peering through the narrow slit in the wall. Behind\nhim could be heard the labored breathing of twenty-seven distraught men.\nOne man snored. \"Wake up, you stupid ass,\" Pane told Lanham. \"You'll\nwreck the show.\"\n\nAt last the door opened and Blunt came in--with the girl.\n\nShe was breath-taking. She wore, O'Connors reported, a dress cut to\nhere--and her hair was piled high on her patrician head. Blunt had not\nlied. She was even prettier than the usual run of Engraham girls.\n\n\"He's offering her a drink,\" O'Connors whispered.\n\n\"She take it?\"\n\n\"No--she's sitting at the bar. He's having one, though. He's turning on\nthe hi-fi.\"\n\nHe did not have to tell them, since all could hear the soft music. They\nhad selected a program of melodies considered sure-fire.\n\n\"He's talking to her--putting his arm around her waist. Oh-oh. She\nknocked it off. She's laughing, though.\"\n\nIn the silence they all heard her laugh. Several men moved\nuncomfortably. \"He's leading her toward the couch--oh-oh--she stopped to\nlook at the radar screen.\"\n\nIt was the auxiliary radar, not the important one in the control room.\n\"What's he doing?\"\n\n\"Telling her--he's edging her to the couch again--now she's asking about\nthe Bassett Blaster. They're fooling around with the gun. He's showing\nher how it works--trying to put his hands--!\"\n\nThis last was lost, for there was a sudden, resounding blast. Their\nbunks, the entire ship, trembled.\n\nThe meaning was clear to all. They flattened to their bunks, and waited\ntensely. They heard a sound, the sound of a foot kicking a body. A hand\nscratched tentatively along the wall.\n\nNo one moved. \"She killed him.\" O'Connors voice was no more than a\nslight whisper. \"Lay low--lay low.\"'\n\nThen a woman's voice said, in perfect English, \"All right, you men. Come\nout of there.\"\n\nThe door was found and flung open. Catataphinaria stood in the dim\nlight--still holding the Blaster. She said again, more sharply, \"I said,\nCome out of there!\"\n\nClumsily, they came down from their bunks.\n\n\"Now,\" she said, as she had them all against the wall, \"call down the\nothers.\"\n\nBut this was unnecessary, for the Doctors and the Colonel were already\ndescending the ladder. They turned quite white at the sight of her.\nWordlessly, she indicated that they were to join the others. The Doctors\nfound it harder to adjust to a purely military sort of emergency. Ankers\nasked clearly, \"What on earth is this nonsense?\"\n\n\"No nonsense,\" the girl said. \"Just do as I say. First, surrender all\nyour papers.\"\n\n\"Our papers?\"\n\n\"Your research. Your conclusions. Everything.\"\n\nHenderson said, \"I'll go get it, Ma'am.\"\n\n\"I would also like the Colonel's amusing work on the coming occupation.\"\n\n\"I know where it is, sir,\" Martin said swiftly. \"I'll get it.\"\n\nThe Colonel's expression was stony. He nodded to Martin to get it, and\nit occurred to him that the girl was one of those whom he had personally\nselected as the most promising for the puppet governments. But when he\nasked about her identity, she cut him off without a word.\n\n\"Then, may I ask where you learned such flawless English?\"\n\n\"All of us know English,\" she said. \"It is a very stupid language.\"\n\nMartin and Henderson returned with the papers. Gingerly they approached\nher, handed the papers to her, and darted back to their places in the\nline. She placed the stack on the bar, leafed through it, all the while\nkeeping them covered with the Blaster, and remarked on finishing, \"It is\nexactly what one would expect barbarians to find interesting.\"\n\nFlandeau, however, remained a scientist to the last.\n\n\"We find ourselves unhappily deceived,\" he said. \"We were certain--that\nyou were utterly without defenses. We were told that you did not know\n_how_ to lie, cheat, dissemble, or fight.\"\n\n\"Only not with each other.\" she said. \"It was, so to speak, a lost art.\"\nShe glanced at Blunt. Several men squirmed. \"But it is one that we have\nregained,\" she said.\n\n\"And what will you do with us?\" Flandeau asked.\n\n\"We have decided to let you go,\" she said. \"Now that we possess this\nweapon,\"--she brandished the Blaster--\"which we can copy, we think we\ncan prevent more Explorations. At least this is the opinion of the\nEleven. So I am instructed to let you leave--at once, of course.\"\n\n\"You are most charming,\" said Flandeau.\n\n\"At once,\" she repeated.\n\n\"Yes, of course. Men! Prepare for blastoff!\"\n\n                                  ----\n\nThe way back was tedious--the floating around, the boredom, the unending\nblackness of space--but at least it was going home. After the first\nweeks of space-sickness, things returned to near normal, and the Doctors\nconferred with the Colonel. It was decided that the best report should\nbe that Engraham was uninviting, bleak, and of no interest to Earthmen.\nThe reputations of all were at stake (the doctors found themselves,\nstripped of their papers, unable to recollect enough, and the Colonel\ndesperately feared a court-martial) and the crew was thus advised. All\nagreed to keep their mouths shut. Thus their honorable discharges,\nmedals, and life-time pensions would be safe.\n\nSo, with all this decided, and Earth only a few months away, relative\ncheerfulness reigned. Only Willy Lanham continued to mope.\n\n\"What's biting you?\" Kosalowsky asked, one day as they lay strapped in\nadjacent bunks. \"Your face is as long as this ship.\"\n\n\"I just feel bad,\" Willy said. \"I can feel bad if I want to, can't I?\"\n\n\"What the hell, we'll soon be home. We can really raise some hell,\nthen.\"\n\n\"I miss my girl,\" Willy blurted out.\n\n\"You'll see her pretty soon.\"\n\n\"I mean my girl on Engraham.\"\n\nIt happened that just then several other men, bored with lying still,\nwere floating past. They gripped the edges of Willy's bunk.\n\n\"You mean you had,\" Kosalowsky said cunningly, \"a girl on Engraham?\"\n\n\"Sure I did,\" said Willy defensively. \"Didn't all you guys?\"\n\nMore and more men joined the knot of bodies around Willy's bunk. The\natmosphere became distinctly menacing.\n\n\"You mean you didn't?\" Willy said. \"You mean it wasn't a gag we were\npulling on Blunt?\"\n\nThey were silent. One pair of floating hands neared Willy's throat.\n\n\"Honest,\" he said. \"I didn't think you were that dumb. I thought you\nwere just letting Blunt make an ass of himself. I thought that--well, it\nwas so easy. I even told Dick a couple of times. You just had to make a\ngrab for 'em.\"\n\nPane suddenly let out a harsh sound, like the cry of a wounded bull.\n\n\"So who was this frail?\" Kosalowsky asked heavily.\n\n\"Yeah!\" echoed the others.\n\n\"Well, she was just a frail, I guess,\" Willy said. \"I used to see her\naround the ship. On guard duty. I used to see her all the time. What the\nhell,\" he said, \"You think I'm dumb or something? Why'd you think I was\nwilling to stand guard all the time?\"\n\n\n                                 *END*\n\n",
