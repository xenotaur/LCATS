    "body": "Steve Nolan was three years dead, pyro-burned in the black space off\nLuna when a prison break failed. But Nolan had a job to do. Nolan came\nback.\n\nWhere the Avalon Trail bends across Annihilation Range, a thousand icy\nmiles from Pluto's northern stem, Nolan stopped and closed the intake\nvalve of his helmet. Count five seconds, and he unhooked the exhausted\ntank of oxygen; count ten more and it was spinning away, end over end\nover Pluto's frozen surface, and a new tank was already in place. He\nslipped the pressure valve and inhaled deeply of the new air.\n\nHe'd come ten miles by the phosphorescent figures on the nightstone\nmarkers beside the trail. Fifteen more miles to go.\n\nHis cold black eyes stared absently at the east, where the pseudo-life\nof the great Plutonian crystals rolled in a shifting, tinkling sea. He\nnoted the water-avid crystals, and noted the three crablike crawlers\nthat munched a solitary clump of metallic grass. You don't walk, talk\nand breathe after a Tri-planet Lawman has declared you dead unless you\nnote everything around you and react to what may be dangerous.\n\nBut he was looking beyond the familiar Plutonian drear, to the eastern\nhorizon where faint lights gleamed in the dark. That was Port Avalon.\nThat was where Steve Nolan was bound.\n\nWoller was in Avalon. The Alan Woller who had made him an outlaw,\nroaming the star trails from Pluto to the Satellites, never daring to\nreturn to the inner worlds where Tri-planet kept order.\n\nThere was a slow pulse mounting in Nolan's throat as he walked on,\nsavagely kicking a crab-shelled crawler from his path. He'd seen\nthe newssheet, months old, in a rickety old port on one of the\nSatellites--Io? Ganymede?--when he was down to forty credits and a\nfriendly bartender. It hadn't been much of an item. The kind a country\neditor throws into his finance column when he unexpectedly loses an ad\nand has to fill space.\n\n    \"The new shipping company, which expects to do much for improving\n    commercial relations with the outer planets, is headed by Alan\n    Woller, formerly with the Interplanetary Telenews Company. Woller\n    is remembered as the prosecution's star witness in the trial of\n    Steve Nolan, the Junta agent indicted for treason three years ago.\n    Nolan, sentenced to life imprisonment in Luna Cave, was killed\n    while attempting to escape.\n\n    \"The new company is capitalized at over a billion dollars, and has\n    already taken options on bases in....\"\n\nThe drink had drained out of Steve Nolan when he saw that. And the\nbartender had been too friendly for his own good. He'd been a soft\ntouch for five hundred credits.\n\nThat had been rocket fare to Pluto for Nolan.\n\n\n\nHe felt the drumming with the soles of his feet, a hard, grinding\nsensation against his metal boots. He jumped off the trail quickly and\nwhirled to watch for the approaching skid.\n\nIt was moving slowly, chugging along on a single jet.\n\n_Clogged feeders_, Nolan thought as he felt the uneven vibrations. _If\nhe doesn't watch out he'll have a backblast._\n\nThe skid faltered past him, no faster than he could run. He looked away\nfrom the incandescent flare of the one tail jet, then that stopped too.\nTall as a man, a dozen feet long, the skid lay waiting on the trail.\n\nWaiting for Steve Nolan?\n\nAnything was better than walking. Nolan walked up to the skid, not\nfast, and kicked solidly at the entrance. It slid open with a creaking\nnoise and he was in the tank, sealing the outer door behind him.\n\nThe inner door didn't open. A female voice from a speaker said, \"Who\nare you?\"\n\nSteve waited till he saw the pressure and temperature gauges shoot up\nto normal, then swung open his faceplate. \"Matthews is the name,\" he\nlied easily, out of three long years of practice. \"I thought you were\nwaiting for me. Say the word and I'll get out again if I was wrong.\"\n\n\"Oh, no.\" The girl's voice hesitated a second. \"What are you doing out\nhere?\"\n\n\"I'm on my way to Avalon, out of Aylette. A skid bus took me across the\nIce Plains, then I caught a lift on a prospector's skid. He turned off\nten miles back and I decided to walk the rest of the way.\"\n\n\"Do you know anything about skids? Mine isn't working very well. I'll\npay you if you can--\"\n\n\"I'm not a mechanic,\" Nolan said wearily.\n\n\"Oh. Then you can't fix it.\"\n\n\"I didn't say that. You can't pay me for it. I'll take a lift to\nAvalon, though.\"\n\n\"A lift? But I don't know you from Adam.\"\n\nNolan sighed. \"Lady, I don't know you either. Believe me, all I want is\na ride. It'll take me four hours to walk to Avalon. I can't spare the\ntime if I can help it.\" He waited a second. No answer. He shrugged and\nfinished his speech. \"I'll make you a proposition. Let me in and I'll\nfix your jets. We'll be in Avalon in twenty minutes, I'll get out and\nwe'll never see each other again. Don't let me in and I'll tear these\nignition wires right out of the lock. Then we'll both hitchhike.\"\n\nThe girl's voice came with controlled anger. \"You win,\" she said. \"Come\nin.\" There was a soft click, and the inner door yielded under Nolan's\nhand. He stepped in.\n\n\"No hard feelings,\" he said mildly. \"I really wanted the ride. One\nthing you might remember in the future, though--there are no ignition\nwires in an air lock.\"\n\n\n\nShe was pretty, she was small, she was blue-eyed and brunette. But\nshe didn't say a word to him. She kept to her seat at the controls,\nwatching him lift the top off the distributing chamber, prod around in\nthe gummy mess inside for a second, then replace it and nod.\n\n\"You can start it up now, lady,\" he said. He glanced over her shoulder\nthrough the plastic panel, to where Avalon's lights were glowing. Where\nWoller was. \"And the quicker,\" he said, \"the better.\"\n\nThe girl looked at him curiously but said nothing. She turned and\nfingered the controls. The song of power that came out of the skid's\njets brought a quick, slight smile to her lips. Nolan caught a glimpse\nof her eyes reflected back at him from the plastic panel. Appreciative\neyes.\n\nHe averted his look. Would there be another time when he could meet the\ngaze of a decent girl and answer it?\n\n_When Woller's dead_, his subconscious answered him. _Until then you're\nnot a man, Nolan. You're a weapon!_\n\nThe skid was climbing, hugging the side of one of the vast foothills\nto Annihilation Range itself, a hundred-foot chasm on one side and the\ncliff on the other. Nolan watched the girl's hands for a sharp second,\nthen relaxed. She knew what she was doing. Unerringly the skid split\nthe center of the trail, following its many turns as though on a track.\nBut--\n\nA sudden high sound escaped her lips. Her foot trod hard on the\nback-jet pedal. The skid slewed crazily, its side crunching against the\ncliff as it halted.\n\n\"What the--\" snarled Nolan, hand leaping to the concealed pyro he wore\nunder his shirt. Then he saw.\n\nAhead of them was an immense rounded bulk, dome-shaped, black as the\nfrozen night. A crawler ... but what a crawler! Its horny shell was\nhalf again the height of a man, filling the trail from cliff to chasm\nbrink. There was no passing that beast. No wonder there had been no\ntraffic from Avalon!\n\nMutely the girl turned to Nolan. He grinned sourly, then clambered into\nthe heat suit he'd just put off.\n\nHe eyed the girl for a second. \"I'm going to have to trust you. I have\nto get to Avalon, so I have to get this misbegotten monstrosity out of\nmy way. And I have to leave the skid to do it. That gives you a fair,\nclear chance.\"\n\nThe girl shook her head. \"I'll take you to Avalon. I owe you that much.\nBut--but how--\"\n\n\"Watch,\" Nolan said curtly, and climbed into the tank. Before he closed\nthe door a thought struck him.\n\nHe poked his head out at her. \"If anything should go wrong,\" he said,\n\"and I find myself scattered all over that valley down there, you'd\nbetter stay put. Keep the crawler away with the brake jet. And wait for\nsomeone to come along. You're not the skidster to back this crate all\nthe way down the trail, with just a brake jet.\"\n\nThen he slammed the inner door, sealed his helmet, pushed his way out.\n\nThe crawler was even bigger than he'd thought. Standing within ten\nfeet of it, he felt tiny and weak, a toy before this massive brute.\nLike ancient Earth dinosaurs, the crawlers kept growing as long as\nthey lived. Tiny as the palm of a man's hand, foot-high creatures like\nthose Nolan had kicked out of his way an hour before or monstrosities\nlike the one before him--all three types existed side by side. Only\nseldom did they grow as great as this. Invulnerable though they were,\nthey perished of starvation, when their bulk grew too much for their\nthousands of tiny legs to carry.\n\nOut of the ebon hulk of the thing came poking a minute head,\ngoggle-eyed, with a luminous halo of green tendrils surrounding it.\nIt blinked weakly at Nolan. He waited patiently. If the thing was\nconvinced he was harmless.\n\nIt was. Recovering from the shock of the skid's arrival it began to\nprepare for motion again. The head poked out toward the skid on a long,\nscrawny neck, examined it minutely. The big carapace shivered and rose\nslightly off the ground as the multitude of tiny legs took up the task\nof carrying it forward.\n\nNolan stood motionless. The creature moved ponderously toward him,\nignoring him. In the dull mind of the creature an object as tiny as\na man was nothing. Even the skid was merely another sort of boulder,\nagainst which it could lean, send it hurtling over to destruction, out\nof its way.\n\nIt moved forward till the hard horn almost touched him. Then Nolan\nleaped.\n\nThis was the moment of decision. He circled the long neck with one\nlashing arm, clamped on it all the pressure he could bring to bear. It\nwas the one sensitive spot the creature had--and protected, normally,\nby armor battleship-thick.\n\nNolan strained the muscles of his arm, cursing the cushion of air\ninside his suit that made a pillow for the beast. The slippery flesh\ncoiled and writhed in his grip; the beast exhaled a great, whistling\nscreech of agony and the snakelike neck curved around. The popeyed head\ndarted in at him, tiny mouth distended to show raw, red flesh inside.\nIt battered ineffectually against the heavy plastic faceplate of his\nsuit.\n\nThe crawler vented its whistling sigh again and staggered drunkenly\naway. Away from the remorseless pressure on its sore spot, away from\nthe agonizing weight of him. Its tiny legs carried it rocking sidewise.\n\nThen abruptly they tried to halt it, gave sharp warning to the tiny\nbrain. It was too late.\n\nThe scrambling legs flailed for a foothold and found vacuum. Nolan gave\na final heave, felt the thing slide away from him, leaped back. Just\nin time. He himself was teetering on the brink of the chasm as the\ncrawler, tiny head darting frantically, soundlessly around, slid over\nand disappeared.\n\nHe didn't look down. The clattering and crashing vibrations from below\ntold what happened. He turned, shook himself and headed for the skid.\n\nThe girl was waiting for him. Nolan was mildly surprised. She looked at\nhim curiously as he entered.\n\n\"A dirty job,\" she offered tentatively.\n\nHe shrugged. \"Yes,\" he said. \"Let's get moving.\"\n\nShe turned without a word. All the way back to Avalon, her back was a\nsilent reproach. Friendship, it said, had been offered--and rebuffed.\n\nNolan had his private thoughts, and dwelt in them. Except for the\nmuffled blast of the rockets there was no sound in the skid until\nthey'd jetted into the great cargo lock in Avalon's crystal dome and\nthe handlers had come to slide the skid into a parking space.\n\nThen, as they got out, she smiled suddenly.\n\nShe said, \"I guess I misjudged you, Mr. Matthews. I'm sorry I was\ndiscourteous, but a girl can't be too careful. Let me take you to\ndinner for an apology.\"\n\nNolan paused and stared at her soberly. Then, \"No, thanks,\" he said. \"I\nmeant it when I said I wasn't interested in you. I have things on my\nmind already.\" He ignored her outstretched hand, turned to leave, then\nstopped. \"Oh, yes,\" he said. \"Thanks for the ride.\"\n\nHe walked cumbrously over to a storage cubicle without looking back.\nHe stripped off his heat suit and checked it with a stout man in\nPluto-city green.\n\nIt was time to plan his next move. There was a pilot's hangout, he\nremembered, a saloon called the Golden Ray. He took a worn notebook\nfrom his shirt pocket, thumbed it to the forgotten address and held the\npage up for the checking attendant to see.\n\n\"How do I get there?\"\n\nThe man's eyes widened a fraction as he took the address in. He\nshrugged imperceptibly. \"Any slidewalk going north,\" he said. \"Get off\nat the Hub and you'll be within a couple blocks of it.\"\n\n\n\nNolan nodded and headed for a moving sidewalk. The notebook went back\ninto the pocket of his open-necked black shirt, and the hand that\nput it there paused a second to touch reassuringly the weight of a\nslim-barreled pyro that swung beneath his armpit, out of sight. It was\nnice to know it was there, even though he didn't need it--yet.\n\nHe paused in a robot restaurant to eat. Saloons like the Golden Ray\ndon't sell much food--particularly to those who have tasted it once. It\nwas getting on toward night.\n\nThe slidewalks were fast, and the first man he stopped at the Hub told\nhim all he needed to know to find the saloon. Once he got within a\nblock of it, it all began to come back. It had been years since he'd\nbeen there, but the place hadn't changed.\n\nA blast of sound struck him as he clawed his way through thick tobacco\nsmoke and sweet Martian hop-incense fumes to the bar. He nodded his\nhead, and the short motion yanked a fat bartender to him.\n\nThe man's slitted eyes peeped surprisedly through the surrounding\ntallow.\n\n\"Gunner!\" he whispered, amiable but hoarse. \"Thought you were somewhere\naround Jupe. What'll it be?\"\n\n\"It'll be nothing right now,\" Nolan said. \"I thought Petersen might be\nhere. I want to see him.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" the bartender said. \"He's dealin' red-dog at one o' the\ntables in the back.\"\n\nNolan was called \"Gunner\" by those who knew him by his alias--He'd\nnever taken the trouble to think up a first name for \"Matthews.\" He\nnodded and stepped away.\n\nIt wasn't hard to find Petersen when you knew his habits. The wrinkled\nlittle man always sat in the noisiest spot he could find. This time\nit was a table right behind the four-piece orchestra, pride of the\nproprietor's heart.\n\nNolan stood silently for a moment behind the little man's chair to\nwatch the play. He marveled at the ease with which Petersen's gnarled\nfingers handled the flying pasteboards. As usual, Petersen's pile of\nchips was low, and the set of his back was discouraged.\n\nNolan grinned. It was part of Petersen's stock-in-trade to look like\nthe tail end of a losing streak. The sucker trade stays away from a\nwinning gambler. But they flocked to Petersen--and his pockets were\nalways clinking.\n\nPetersen's gambler's sixth sense was functioning. He twitched his\nshoulders uncomfortably, then turned around, glaring up. \"Say,\" he\nbegan, \"who the hell are--Oh, Gunner!\"\n\nNolan nodded. \"Hey there, Peter,\" he said.\n\nPetersen grinned and blinked. He looked with regret at his top card,\nthen at Nolan. \"No?\" he asked wistfully.\n\nNolan shook his head. \"No.\"\n\nThe little man shrugged and flipped his cards away. \"Okay,\" he said\ncheerfully, shoveling his chips into his clanking pockets. \"Lead on,\nGunner.\"\n\nNolan led on, to a more secluded corner where the clamor of the alleged\norchestra was less deafening. He sent a waiter off for a bottle of\nsealed Terrestrial Scotch, then turned to Petersen.\n\n\"Where's Woller?\" he asked.\n\nPetersen scowled. \"Listen, Steve,\" he begged, \"stay out of trouble.\nWoller's big here.\"\n\n\"Don't call me Steve,\" Nolan said mildly. Two living men knew that\nNolan and Matthews were the same. Petersen was one of them--Nolan\nhimself the other. \"I manage my own affairs. I want to see Woller.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Petersen groaned. \"He's at the Elena. The big hotel near South\nLock.\"\n\nNolan nodded. \"Good enough,\" he said. \"I'll take care of my business\nwith him right away.\"\n\nThe greasy-aproned waiter came back with the Scotch. Nolan inspected\nthe seal critically, then broke it and poured two generous slugs.\n\"How!\" he said. \"What've you been doing with yourself, Pete?\"\n\nPetersen swallowed his Scotch, grimaced non-committally. \"Following the\nprospectors,\" he said. \"Making money and losing it. It's been a long\ntime since you were here.\"\n\nNolan ignored the implied question. \"Pretty long,\" he agreed. \"I wasn't\nfiguring on coming, but I heard Woller was here.\"\n\nPetersen nodded his head sadly. \"You're aching for trouble,\" he\nobserved. \"Woller's no man to buck up against. He's got money behind\nhim.\"\n\n\"Whose money?\"\n\n\"I dunno. Some Martian syndicate, they say. He's come a long way since\nhe was your boss at Telenews.\"\n\n\"Not so long I couldn't follow him.\"\n\nPetersen cocked an eyebrow, then poured another round. \"You followed\nhim into a bad spot,\" he said slowly. \"This whole town is be-jittered.\nHe's doing about what he likes and nobody says boo.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nPetersen frowned. \"'Cause they're scared, it looks. Scared of the\nJunta. Talk is there are Junta men around. I wouldn't have to remind\nyou, I guess, of what Woller can say about you if he sees you.\"\n\nNolan nodded. \"He won't see me--in time for it to do him any good.\"\n\nPetersen shivered. \"You're building up trouble,\" he repeated. \"Woller's\npretty near running this place.\"\n\n\"'A louse,'\" Nolan quoted, \"'enthroned in luxury, will still a\nloathsome insect be.' That's Woller.\"\n\nPetersen's wizened little troll-face gaped at him. \"Lice bite,\" he said\nsuccinctly.\n\nNolan said soberly, \"Live ones do. After tonight Woller may not be able\nto bite anybody. Dead lice have no friends.\"\n\n\n                                  II\n\nSteve Nolan was deceptively slender in his open-necked, black military\nshirt and trim khaki slacks. In the half-hearted illumination thrown by\nAvalon's old gasglow lights, he looked almost boyish.\n\nBut he didn't look like the pale youth he'd been three years before.\nThe good-natured roundness of his face had contracted to show the hard\nbone underneath. There was the ghost of a scar close to an eye, and the\nseared mark of a pyro burn where neck joined his right shoulder. The\nlong fingers that once had twirled the toggles of a field newscaster's\nwalky-talky now were better acquainted with the groves of a pyro butt.\n\n\"For the last time,\" he said, \"you're better off home in bed. I think\nthere may be trouble.\"\n\nPetersen looked sour. \"Good thinking,\" he said. \"I have a hunch that\nway, too. I'm going to stick around.\"\n\nNolan shrugged. He eyed the Hotel Elena, towering almost up to the\ncrystal dome, directly across the street from him. \"It's your neck,\"\nhe said. \"You can catch me when I fly out.\" He glanced quickly at a\nwrist-chrono. \"A quarter after four,\" he said. \"If I'm not out in half\nan hour don't wait up. I may be detained.\"\n\nBefore Petersen could answer he was crossing the street, entering the\nhotel. The Elena was large, and the night clerk couldn't be expected to\nknow every guest. He glanced up as Nolan entered, then went back to\nnodding over his magazine. Nolan walked to the grav-well and stepped in.\n\nNolan let the curiously soothing grav-currents flow over him, carrying\nhim up till he'd ascended twelve floors. That was where Woller was, by\nthe best information Petersen had been able to give him. He reached out\na hand and swung himself out of the flow, into a silent corridor.\n\nNot quite silent. Nolan listened and smiled. There was a party\nsomewhere overhead; a vise-box blared briefly in one of the rooms on\nthis corridor as a sleepless guest hunted music. From the grav-well\ncame the low humming of the generators.\n\nThat was fine. If it were necessary to make any noise it might be\nconfused with the vise-box, or the singing from overhead.\n\nWoller's door was locked, of course. Nolan bent over the keyhole for a\nsecond. There was a tinny, springy _click_, and the door drifted open\nunder the slow pressure of his hand.\n\nThe room was large and empty. A library, perhaps, as well as he could\njudge by the intermittent blood-tinted light that filtered in from an\nadvertising stereolume across the street. Nolan flipped his cigarette\nlighter out, held it aloft and pressed the button. In the dim glow it\nshed he saw twin doors. After a moment's hesitation, he chose one,\nopened it gently, slipped through into a bedroom.\n\nA night light glowed softly on the wall, revealing nothing. Nolan\nsniffed the air curiously, then wrinkled his nose. Perfume! Woller had\nadded a new vice to his character. Nolan grimaced contemptuously, then\nmoved toward the indistinct figure on the bed. His right hand dipped\ninside his shirt, came away with the slim pyro protruding from his fist.\n\n\"Woller,\" he said. \"Wake up. You've got company.\"\n\n\n\nThere was a rustle from the bed, a gasp, a metallic click. Nolan jumped\nback, cursing. He flung an arm over his head as the overhead lumes\nburst into blinding light. But he'd caught a quick, stunning glimpse\nof what was on the bed and, quicker than starflight, his pyro jutted\ntoward the lumes, flared wickedly. All lights died as the blast\nshorted the wires.\n\nIt had been a girl in the bed, blinking up sleepily, mouth a taut\nline of surprise. _The_ girl--the one from the skid, the one he'd\nencountered in Annihilation Range! She had no more of a look at him\nthan he at her, and she had been sleep-dazed, staring up at the light.\nPerhaps she hadn't recognized him--\n\n\"Hold still,\" he hissed--there is no personality to a whisper. \"Where's\nAlan Woller?\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" the girl's voice came, a trifle unsteady. Good--she\nhadn't recognized him!\n\nNolan laughed voicelessly. \"I'm the man with the gun,\" he replied. \"I\nask the questions. Where's Woller?\"\n\n\"None of your business,\" the girl said. There was a note of confidence\nin her voice, and suddenly Nolan felt a furtive movement from the bed.\nWas there an alarm--a bell to summon servants?\n\n\"Hold it!\" he whispered sharply. \"One wrong move and I'll kill you. I\nmean business--and I want an answer.\"\n\nThe girl's voice was even now. \"I won't give one.\"\n\nNolan's brows drew down over his eyes. What was this girl to Woller?\nWhatever the connection was, by rights he should take no chances. The\ngirl was a danger to him--and the life of no woman on Woller's string\nshould be permitted to stand between him and the chance for vengeance\non the man who had framed him.\n\n\"I'll give you ten seconds,\" he whispered harshly.\n\nBut already he was stepping silently backward, concealed in the\nabyss-black gloom of the chamber. He reached noiselessly behind him for\nthe knob of the door. He was being a fool and he knew it. But he had\nseen honesty in her eyes, back on the skid, and even the yearning for\nrevenge couldn't make him blot that out with pyro-flame.\n\nHe opened the door, slid out, closed it softly behind him. The girl\nsaid nothing, perhaps had not known he had gone. Nolan cast a quick\nlonging glance at the other door, but there was no time. In seconds the\ngirl would discover she was alone. There would be an alarm, surely.\n\nA dim thread of light showed him the door to the hall. Catlike he\ncrossed to it, then halted, petrified. Men were coming down the\nhall, several of them by the voices. He caught a snatch of a rasping\ncomplaint: \"_Old man Woller's tin soldiers, that's us. Who the hell\ndoes he--_\"\n\nNolan swore lividly under his breath. The end of the trail had come.\n\nBut he stepped back a pace and stood there, pyro up-tilted and ready.\nHe would have a split-second's advantage. If only there were no more\nthan two or three of them--\n\n\n\nAnd then the sound was drowned out. A sharp, moaning screech came from\noutside. A harsh metallic wail that climbed for the frigid heavens\nabove, louder than the screaming trumpets of Ragnar\u221a\u2202k.\n\nThe alarm sirens! There was a break in the crystal dome that held the\nlife of Avalon!\n\nMeteorite, accident or simple fatigue--the dome had cracked. Air and\nheat would vanish. Death would tenant the city.\n\nThere was a sudden, sharp babble from the men outside, then the\npounding of footsteps, halting as they dove into the grav-shaft.\nNolan's chance! But he froze in his tracks, then whirled. He ran to the\ndoor behind him and wrenched it open.\n\n\"Get a heat suit!\" he bawled to the girl on the bed. \"Dome's cracked!\nYou've got maybe twenty minutes--less, if it's a bad break!\"\n\nHis voice was a bellow--there was no time for whispers. No time, and\nperhaps no need. If the dome had gone, Avalon might be a city of\ncorpses, heat suits or none, before help could arrive with fresh oxygen\ntanks from far-away Aylette. Disguise would hardly matter then.\n\nBut he wasted no time in thought. He was out the door, down the hall\nand dropping into the cushioning grav-web of the descending shaft in\nseconds. Guests were waking in their rooms. The corridors were filling\nwith shouting men and women. The shriek of emergency trucks filtered in\nfrom the street, and the hoarse bellow of the alarm sirens multiplied\nthe havoc done to the peace of the night.\n\nIf he could get to a ship--?\n\nBut the slidewalks would be jammed with panicky humans, all with the\nsame thought. A heat suit was his only chance. And the nearest ones he\nknew of were at South Lock, at the base of the dome itself!\n\nHe swung himself out of the shaft, raced across the lobby, which was\nalready beginning to fill with people intent on escape. He was out the\ndoor with the van of them, racing across a still empty street toward\nSouth Lock.\n\nA slim, pale figure darted across in front of him. He moved to dodge\npast, then slowed momentarily as he saw who it was.\n\n\"Steve!\" Only one man knew that name--Petersen!\n\n\"Pete! What are you waiting for? Come on--get a suit!\"\n\nPetersen sighed, touched Nolan's shoulder to halt him. \"There's no\nhurry, pal,\" he said mildly.\n\n\"No hurry! The dome alarm--\"\n\nPetersen shook his head. \"Forget it,\" he said. \"I turned the alarm in\nmyself.\"\n\n\n\nToward what passed for morning in Avalon, the confusion died down. The\nemergency cars were off the streets, the sirens had long since stopped\nwailing and the last irate citizen had retired for what remained of a\nnight's sleep.\n\nPetersen came back from the window of his shabby little one-room\napartment and reported on progress to Nolan.\n\n\"All quiet,\" he said. \"Sure you won't change your mind and lie down for\na while? You'll be needing sleep pretty soon.\"\n\nNolan swallowed the rest of his coffee, stubbed out a cigarette and\nshook his head. \"No time,\" he said. He glanced at his chrono. \"I figure\non leaving in twenty minutes. You're sure Woller's going to be on that\nship?\"\n\nPetersen grinned. \"Pretty sure,\" he said. \"I have my ways.\"\n\n\"You looked good on the deal last night,\" Nolan said. \"You and your\nhammy ideas. I would have got out without all that.\"\n\nPetersen was serious. \"Not alive, no. When I saw those apes coming down\nthe street I was pretty sure something was up. So I got on a phone--I\ngot a friend works for Woller's company, and he reads the boss'\nmail--and that's what he told me. Woller has to get back to the Inner\nPlanets in a hurry. He's sent a bunch of his company guards to pick up\nsome stuff at his apartment. The only thing I could think of was to\nturn in the alarm and hope you'd get out in the confusion. You're a\nsmart boy, but you ain't Dead-eye Dick, friend. You couldn't of fought\nit out with five of Woller's finest.\"\n\nNolan inclined his head. \"Maybe you're right. You say something big\nseems to be up?\"\n\n\"What else? He gets a red-hot sealed teleflash from Aylette. Sealed,\nmind you--my friend can't listen in. He cancels the orders of the\nonly ship his new company has in Avalon--cancels all the cargo\ncontracts--and takes off in it in the middle of the night for Aylette.\nHe'll be back here this morning, they say, to pick up those papers.\nThen they're off again, deep space, this time. The clearance says Mars.\"\n\nNolan nodded. His face was impassive, but a slight crinkling of the\nlines around his lean nose showed thought. What was Woller up to?\n\nIt was curiously difficult to concentrate on Woller. Absently, he found\nhimself saying. \"And you don't know who the girl was?\"\n\n\"My information don't go that far,\" Petersen admitted. \"He has a\ndaughter some place, but she ain't supposed to be here now. But what's\nyour guess about this she?\"\n\n\"My guess is you're right,\" Nolan agreed reluctantly. There was\nsomething about soft blue eyes and silk-fine black hair that did not\nfit in the same picture with Woller.\n\nPetersen was looking at him shrewdly, with a dim light of understanding\nglowing in his eyes and a hint of pity. As Nolan looked at him,\nPetersen looked away, began fumbling inside his waist-band.\n\n\"What're you doing?\" Nolan asked curiously.\n\n\"You'll need money,\" said Petersen. He finished unbuckling and dragged\nout an oiled-silk money belt. Without opening it, he tossed it to\nNolan. \"Here. You'll have to bid high to get passage on Woller's ship.\nThis'll help.\"\n\nNolan nodded. \"Thanks,\" he said. \"Look, I--\"\n\nPetersen waved a hand airily. \"Forget it. As long as there's enough\nradium on Pluto for prospectors to find, I'll have plenty money.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Nolan. \"But the thanks still goes.\" He closed his eyes for\na second, rubbed them. Then he blinked rapidly, took out his pyro and\nchecked it. Full clip, save the one shell he'd used on the light last\nnight. Twenty-three shots. He deftly slipped another cartridge in to\nmake the full two dozen, then replaced the gun in its shoulder holster.\n\n\"You're going to get into trouble with that thing,\" Petersen prophesied.\n\nNolan shrugged. \"I've got a name to live up to. A gunner has to have a\ngun--and I kind of think I'm going to need this one.\" He glanced at the\nchrono again and stood up, stretching.\n\n\"Well, good-by,\" he said casually. \"I owe you a bunch of favors. You\nwon't have to remind me.\"\n\n\"Course not,\" Petersen agreed. \"Wouldn't do much good. But I'll sort of\nmention it to your heirs.\"\n\n\n\nAt the Operations lock of the Avalon spaceport Nolan opened the money\nbelt Petersen had given him for the first time. He peered inside and\nwhistled.\n\nThe cards had been with Petersen, all right. The little man had carried\na young fortune around with him. He tucked the belt in a pocket with a\nmental resolve to pay it back some day, if he lived long enough, and\nwent into the observation room.\n\nThrough the crystal dome he could see the ship, the only one on the\nfield. It was a beauty--brand-new and glistening. By the look of her,\nshe was the latest type. Pure gravity drive, the rocket jets used only\nfor landing. It had a name, limned phosphorescent on a dark panel in\nthe glittering hull: _Dragonfly_.\n\nHe turned and walked over to the port clearance officer. \"I have to get\nto Mars,\" he said. \"I hear this ship's bound there. Who do I see about\nbooking passage?\"\n\nThe port official scratched his bony head. \"It's an unscheduled run,\"\nhe said, \"and I dunno if they're taking any passengers. But over\nthere--\" he waved a hand--\"is the second mate. He might help you.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\" Nolan walked over, eyeing the pallid, short-bodied Venusian\nindicated. The man was staring glumly out of the observation panel.\n\n\"You the second on the ship out there?\" Nolan asked.\n\nThe man turned slowly and looked him up and down. \"Yeah,\" he said\nfinally. \"What about it?\"\n\nNolan allowed his eyes to narrow conspiratorially. \"I hear you're\nbound for Mars,\" he said, lowering his voice. \"Any chance of taking a\npassenger?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nNolan tapped a pocket. \"Listen,\" he said, \"it isn't just that I want a\nride. I have to get to Mars. I'll pay.\"\n\nThe Venusian laughed sharply and Nolan thought, not for the first time,\nhow superior environment is to heredity. The Venusians, like most of\nthe System's intelligent life, were descended from Earthmen all right,\nbut the adjective that described them best was \"fishy.\"\n\nThe second said, \"Pay? You haven't got enough money to get you into the\nlock of that ship.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" Nolan said easily. He took the money belt out of\nhis pocket, flashed the contents for a second. \"I meant it,\" he said.\n\"I have to get to Mars. Name your price--I've got it.\"\n\nThe Venusian's eyes widened. Nolan saw, from the corner of his eye, a\nskid rocketing across the field. It halted by the _Dragonfly_, and the\nship's lock opened. Two bulky, heat-suited figures hurried out of the\nskid, into the ship.\n\n\"What do you say?\" Nolan persisted, accelerated by the sight of the\nfigures. One of them would be Woller's thug with the apparently vital\npapers. That would be the big one--the smaller might be a clerk from\nhis office.\n\n\"Okay,\" the mate capitulated. \"Tell you what. It'll cost you ten\nthousand credits. If it's worth that to you, all right.\"\n\nNolan shrugged wryly. \"It's worth my neck,\" he grinned confidentially.\n\nThe Venusian grinned moistly back. \"Payable in advance,\" he specified.\n\"Now. Give it to me and I'll go out and arrange the deal with the\ncaptain.\"\n\n_Keeping a percentage of course_, Nolan thought; but he only nodded\nand silently counted out the money. The Venusian grabbed it without\nchecking the count. He said, \"Okay, I'll be back in a minute,\" and left.\n\nNolan watched him struggle into his suit and clamber across the frigid\nsoil of the field. The lock opened for him, then closed again. Nolan\nsensed a sudden uneasiness. He almost jumped when the port officer came\nup behind him and said:\n\n\"Wouldn't take you, huh?\"\n\nNolan turned. \"Sure,\" he said. \"He had to go arrange it with the\ncaptain. I'll go out with him when he comes back for his clearance\npapers.\"\n\n\"Clearance papers!\" the official barked. \"Good Lord, man, they've had\nthose for hours. That man isn't coming back!\"\n\n\n                                  III\n\nNolan, swearing incandescently, flung his heat-suit voucher at the\nofficer, grabbed the first suit in the rack and was in the main lock,\nwaiting for the inner door to close, before he put it on. He had\nalready sealed the suit and stepped out on the field when he noticed\nwhat the excited hammering of the port official on the lock door should\nhave told him.\n\nThe suit had only a single oxygen tank in its clip--and the gauge\nshowed \"empty\"!\n\nHe hesitated only a moment. His eye caught a glimpse of the\n_Dragonfly_, etched sharply against the black horizon by the field's\nblazing floodlights. Its smooth lines were suddenly blurred and\nindistinct. The grav-web was building up around it. In a moment it\nwould be gone!\n\n\"Damn!\" yelled Nolan, to the sole detriment of his own eardrums.\nAlready the slight amount of air in his suit was nearly used up. But as\nsoon as the web reached full focus the _Dragonfly_ would blast off and\nWoller would be beyond reach for a long time!\n\nNolan swore fervently, then sealed his writhing lips to save air. He\nset off in a slow, heavy trot for the shimmering spaceship. He was\nbreathing pure carbon dioxide and staggering nicely by the time he\npushed his way through the thickening resistance of the grav-web to the\nmassive outer door of the lock.\n\nHis bulging eyes caught the lever that opened the lock, guarded by a\nscoop-shaped streamshield. He yanked it blindly, saw the heavy panel\nroll aside, stumbled in.\n\nSome member of the crew must have been watching--someone with\ncompassion, unexpected enough in a ship of Woller's. The lock door\nclanged shut behind him and clean air hissed in. Nolan tore frantically\nat his faceplate and gulped deeply, dizzyingly.\n\nThe metal flooring shuddered. He felt an intolerable weight drag at his\nwater-weak body as the ship took off. He hadn't made it by much, at\nthat. A couple of seconds more and he would have been left.\n\n\"Boy!\" Nolan gasped. \"Somebody sure doesn't want me along on this ride.\"\n\nThe inner door was sliding open. Nolan stepped out into a well lit\ncorridor, almost colliding with the flabby bulk of the Venusian.\n\nThe mate glared at him darkly, the hand on his waist poised\nsuggestively above the butt of a pyro.\n\nBefore he could speak, Nolan said mildly, \"You're a thieving louse. But\nI'm on the ship, and I won't hold it against you. Only--don't try that\nagain.\"\n\nThe mate flushed. \"The captain didn't want to take you,\" he mumbled. \"I\nwas going to send your dough back soon's we touched ground.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Nolan agreed. \"Having my full name and address the way you do,\nit'd be easy. Well, skip it. Where's my cabin?\"\n\nYou wouldn't call it exactly hospitable, the way the mate stalled as\nlong as he could, obviously trying to cudgel his feeble Venusian brain\ninto some plan for getting rid of the unwanted passenger. But Nolan\nfinally got his cabin.\n\n\n\nIt was the smallest and worst on the ship, of course, but the ship was\na beauty. Nolan smiled in real appreciation when he saw the room. The\nfurniture was glow-tinted plastic; the bed was covered with Earth silk.\n\n\"Beat it,\" he told the mate, and watched the door close behind him.\nThen he sat down to chart a course.\n\nWoller might recognize him.\n\nThat was the first danger. True, Nolan had been reported dead and\nWoller knew nothing to the contrary. It was only a miracle that Nolan\nwasn't dead, in fact. Only the incredible chance of his being picked\nup in midspace, where he floated helplessly, one shoulder brutally\npyro-scarred and half the air gone from his suit, had saved him then.\n\nThat had been one miracle, for even the ranging, avid patrol boats\nhadn't been able to find him after his mad leap from a lock of the ship\nthat was carrying him to the Moon.\n\nBut that miracle had occurred. And the second miracle was that the\npleasure craft that saved him was piloted by a man who lived outside\nthe law but had an iron-clad code of honesty--who wouldn't turn Nolan\nin for the bounty money on fugitives. Pete Petersen's scrawny shoulders\nbore no wings, but he'd seemed like an angel to Nolan that desolate\nday, when he'd seen the flare of Nolan's desperate signal rocket and\nswung round in a wide arc to pick him up, eventually to take him to the\nlawless safety of the Belt.\n\nTo everyone but Petersen, Steve Nolan was dead. And the little shots\nof gray now running through Nolan's dark hair, the scar that crossed\none tanned cheek, gave him a new personality. He looked slender and\ndangerous as a lunging rapier, and every bit as cold.\n\nBut Woller would have good cause to remember Nolan. Woller had sat\nthere in the courtroom, back on Earth. He'd sat there the whole\ndragging week of the trial, with Nolan's eyes on him every minute. He\nlooked directly at Nolan, even while he was in the chair, telling the\nlies that linked Nolan with the Junta--the secret, revolutionary group\nof outer-planet malcontents that sought to overthrow Tri-planet Law's\npeace and order.\n\nNolan's lips contorted savagely as he recalled that. A traitor! His\nsole crime had been that he knew too much about Woller, his boss!\n\nWoller had been clever about it. The law itself had removed Nolan,\na menace to his lawless schemes. When Nolan, on his own initiative,\nhad talked and bribed his way into seeing a confessed and condemned\nsaboteur of the Junta for an interview, he'd found to his sick\nastonishment that the man was one he had seen in Woller's own office,\nnot two months before.\n\nHe'd been childishly simple about it, had confronted Woller and\ndemanded an explanation. Woller had put on his friendliest face and\npromised one--later....\n\nAnd then Woller had turned the dogs loose.\n\nWithin an hour Nolan was in jail for the bribery of the prison\nofficials. The next morning came the incredible indictment: Sabotage\nfor the Junta!\n\nNolan grimaced, recalled the careful, hideous network of lies and\nforgeries, the distorted evidence, the perjuries. But he had been one\nman, and Woller represented vast power.\n\nThen abruptly there was a knock on the door. Jolted out of his\nthoughts, Nolan started, then called: \"Just a minute.\"\n\nThis was the moment--and he had no plan. His pyro slid out into his\nhand. He broke it, stared at the twenty-four potent heat charges. They\nwould be plan enough for him, if he got a clear shot at Woller. But if\nhe should be disarmed, if Woller should suspect.\n\nA moment later, the pyro hidden beneath his shirt again, he opened the\ndoor. It was the Venusian second, as before.\n\n\"Captain wants to see you,\" he growled. \"Come on.\"\n\nThe _Dragonfly_ was a single-deck craft, the captain's cabin located\ntopside of the deck and amidships. Nolan looked around curiously,\ndespite his internal tension, as he followed the Venusian along. The\nplastic keel panel underfoot showed an infinity of stars. There was\none, large and bright, outstanding among the lesser stars. Nolan\nrecognized it--the Sun, parent star to the farflung planet they'd just\nleft. Now it was dim and feeble, but by the time they got within sight\nof the Inner Worlds it would be a ravenous thing, reaching out to\ndestroy them with lethal radiations.\n\nOut of curiosity, he asked. \"When are you going to opaque?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" The Venusian looked startled for a second; then his\nblubber-drowned little eyes became shrewd. \"Oh, about Orbit Saturn, I\nguess.\"\n\n\n\nNolan suppressed a sudden frown. He asked carefully, \"Say, how do you\ndo it on these new-type ships anyhow? All the ones I've been on, you\nhad to have the panels filter-shuttered before they lifted gravs.\"\n\n\"Paint,\" the mate said curtly. \"Okay, here we are.\"\n\nHe stood aside, pointed to a door with a glowing golden star embossed\non it. Nolan nodded and entered, but his thoughts were racing.\n\nPaint the panels! It would take the whole crew, and they'd never get\nit off. If they opaqued with paint the ship would be blind for weeks.\nThe filter shutters--great strips of polarized colloid--were the only\nsolution to the problem of keeping out the worst of the sun's dread\nradiations, but admitting enough light to guide the ship. But they had\nto be put on externally, before the ship took off. Mars? This ship,\nports transparent as they were, would never dare approach the sun's\nblinding energies closer than Jupiter!\n\n_No wonder they didn't want me_, Nolan thought grimly. _They're not\ngoing within a hundred million miles of Mars!_\n\nThe thought froze in Nolan's mind as he entered the captain's cabin.\nFirst he saw the captain, a tall, demon-black Martio-Terrestrial,\nstanding before his own desk. Then his eyes flicked past, toward the\nflorid-faced man who sat behind the desk, fumbling with a cigarette\nlighter.\n\nAnd then, for the first time in three years, he was face to face with\nAlan Woller.\n\nNolan might have showed a flicker of emotion in his face. Heaven knows,\nthe blast of iron hatred that surged up through his body was powerful\nenough. But Woller was lighting a cigarette. The second that it took\nhim to finish it and look up was time enough for Nolan to freeze.\n\n\"Vincennes is my name,\" the captain was saying. \"What's yours?\"\n\n\"Matthews. I'm sorry to have forced my way onto your ship, but I had to\nget to Mars.\"\n\nWoller looked up then, and a sudden trace of consternation flashed into\nhis eyes. It died away, but a doubt remained.\n\nHe stared intently at Nolan, then said: \"Why?\"\n\nNolan smiled easily. \"A lot of reasons--all of them personal. Who are\nyou?\"\n\nWoller stood up. \"I own this ship,\" he said coldly. \"I didn't ask you\naboard. Now that you're here, you'll answer my question or get off.\"\n\nThe time for a showdown had arrived. _Well_, Nolan thought, _it had to\ncome some time._ He was strangely relaxed.\n\nHe shrugged. \"You've got a point there,\" he admitted. \"Well--\"\n\nHe frowned and raised his hand as though to scratch his head, changed\nthe motion in mid-air. And with the speed of a hopped-up _narcophene_\nsmoker, the thin-snouted pyro was in his fist, slowly traversing a\nlethal arc that covered both men.\n\nHis voice was taut as he spoke. \"It's your ship, Woller, but I'm taking\nit over. Woller--Alan Woller--look at me. _Do you know who I am?_\"\n\nWoller stared deep into the icy eyes confronting him. The doubt flared\nagain in his own. His jaw dropped slack. His brows lifted and he\nwhispered, \"Nolan!\"\n\nNolan didn't bother to nod. He said grimly, \"Your hands--hold them\nwhere they are. You, too, Vincennes. I've come a long way for this\nand I don't mind killing. You taught me that, Woller. A man's life is\nnothing. Mine was nothing to you, when it endangered the dirty little\ntreacheries you were working.\"\n\nThe life seemed to have gone out of Woller and left only a hulking,\npallid carcass, propped up by the internal pressure of its own fear.\nThere was murky horror crawling in his eyes.\n\n\n\nSteve Nolan looked at him and his thin lips curled into a snarling\ngrin. But those were only his lips. Strangely, there was no triumph in\nhis heart, none of the fierce pleasure he'd dreamed of all those dreary\nyears. There was only dull disgust, and the hint of a long-dead hope\nfor rest again. Rest, and the common things of life on the Earth which\nwas forbidden to him.\n\nWoller could die before him now, and he would be avenged. But Woller\nalive could say the words that would wipe out the banishment, would\nreturn him to the green star that was home. Woller could be made to\nconfess--\n\n\"I ought to blast you now,\" he said in a soft, chill tone that was like\na whip to Woller, jerking him upright. \"I ought to, and I will if I\nmust. But you can live if you want to.\"\n\nWoller was licking his lips, his face a mask, only his panic-stricken\neyes alive.\n\n\"You can live,\" Nolan repeated. \"A full statement about the Junta\nframe, in writing. Write it out and thumbprint it, and we'll telestat\nit to the nearest TPL station. Then you can have the lifeboat, Woller,\nand as much of a start as TPL gives you. Are you willing to pay that\nmuch for your life, Woller?\"\n\nWoller's lips were stiff but he forced the words through. \"Go to hell.\"\n\nNolan nodded, and the deadly weariness settled down over him again.\n\"I see your point, of course,\" he said slowly. \"Tri-planet doesn't\ncome out here much and a man is reasonably safe from them. But you,\nWoller--power's your life blood. And a man on the run can't have much\npower. I know.\"\n\nHis finger curled on the trigger of the pyro and Woller, staring\navidly, desperately, whitened at the mouth. His lips moved as though\nabout to form words--\n\nNolan's trigger-sharp senses caught a hint of movement behind him.\n_Fool!_ he thought desperately. _The door!_ He tried to hurl his body\naside, out of the way of the door that opened behind him. But he\ncouldn't do that and keep the pyro leveled on the two men at the desk.\nHe saw Woller, exultant hatred leaping into his purpled face, plunging\nfor a drawer of the desk; saw the door opening and someone stepping\nthrough. Then, just as he was leveling the gun on Woller again,\nhe saw the flashing swing of the other man in the room. Forgotten\nVincennes--with a heavy nightstone paperweight held bludgeon-like in\nhis hand, leaping in at him. He had no chance even to try to turn. The\nweight was coming down on the side of his head. All he could do was try\nto roll with it.\n\nBut the momentum was immense and the heavy weight struck him down to\nthe floor, drove him headlong into unconsciousness....\n\n\n\nSomebody was kicking him. Nolan groaned once, then compressed his lips\nas he remembered where he was.\n\nHe opened his eyes and rolled over. The blubbery Venusian second\nwas standing over him, face sullen but eyes glinting with perverse\npleasure. He raised his heavy spaceman's boot again--\n\n\"Hold it,\" said Woller from the desk. They were still in the cabin.\n\nWoller got up, came over, looking down at Nolan. His bearing was\nconfident again; he exuded an aura of brutal power.\n\n\"You should have killed me, Nolan,\" he said. \"You only get the one\nchance, you see.\"\n\nNolan silently pushed himself erect. His ribs were agonized where the\nsecond had booted them, and a blinding throb in the skull reminded him\nof the captain's blow. He was conscious that his armpit holster hung\nlight. The pyro was gone.\n\nVincennes had left. Only Woller and the Venusian second were in the\ncabin with him. \"My only doubt,\" Woller was saying, \"is whether to\nblast you now or save you for a little later, when I'll have more time.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Nolan tonelessly. \"If you want my vote, it's for now. Get\nit over with.\"\n\nWoller nodded. \"That would be much pleasanter for you. I think I'll\nsave you.\" He nodded slowly. Then, to the mate, \"Take him below!\"\n\nBack down the corridor, the mocking stars still bright through\nthe crystal underfoot. Back and down, till they came to the gray\nroom, where the pulsing, whining generators spun their web of\nanti-gravitational power.\n\n\"We don't have a brig,\" the mate apologized. \"But I think this will\nhold you in.\"\n\nEyes warily on Nolan, he circled him and opened a round metal door. It\nwas an unused storeroom, bare except for rows of vacant metal shelves.\n\n\"In you go,\" said the Venusian, and Nolan complied. The door slammed\nbehind him and was bolted.\n\nThere was a whine in the air, he noticed. The singing of the\ngrav-generators. It was not unpleasant ... at least, not unbearable,\nhe corrected himself. But how it persisted! It was constant as the\nkeening of a jammed frequency-modulator, high as the wail of a banshee.\n\nHe let his aching body slip to the floor, lay there without even trying\nto think. He raised his head for a searching second, but there was\nnothing to see. Bare walls, bare shelves.\n\nHe was helpless. His chance might come when the second let him out.\nTill then, he would sleep.\n\nWhen had he slept last? Save for the few minutes of unconsciousness, it\nwas easily thirty hours. He pillowed his head on his arm....\n\nHe moved his head uncomfortably, burrowed his ear deeper into his\nbiceps. That damned keening! He shifted restlessly, stopped his exposed\near with his other hand. That movement racked the beaten ribs, but the\nshrilling, soft and remorseless, kept on. It was enough to drive a man\nmad! It was--\n\nHe sat bolt upright, eyes flaring angrily. That was what Woller had\nplanned!\n\nIt was torture--subtle, undramatic, simple. But pure, horrid torture.\n\nNolan's face was gray with strain. It was incredible that a sound,\na noise, could become a threat. He'd heard the same sound a million\ntimes before, though never at such close range, or from such titanic\ngenerators. But now--\n\nHe began trying to fill his mind with other things, but there was\nno room for thought in a brain that was brimming with naked sound.\nSnatches of school-days poetry, long columns of multiplication\ntables--They jumbled in his brain. The lines ran together and muddled,\nwere drowned out by the wail of the generators. He gave up and sat\nthere, forcing himself to be still, while the sound hovered in the\natmosphere all around him, his jaw muscles taut enough to bite through\nsteel, a great pulse pounding in his temples....\n\nFlesh could stand only so much. After a while--he didn't know when--he\nwas mercifully unconscious.\n\n\n\nA volcano erupted under him and awoke. His whole body was a mass of\nflame now, head throbbing like the jets of a twenty-ton freight skid,\nchest and ribs as sore as though they were flayed. A sickening weight\nheld him crushed against the metal floor.\n\nThe roaring from without was the sound of the rockets, loud enough to\ndrown out the whine that had nearly killed him. The ship was landing.\nAnd at once there was a gentle jar, then a dizzying vertigo as the\ngrav-web was cut off abruptly. The rockets died down and were silent.\n\nEverything was silent. The change was fantastic, a dream. Nolan, lying\nthere, thought the silence was the finest thing he had ever heard.\n\nIt didn't last. There were footsteps outside, and the Venusian second\nmate entered. \"On your feet,\" he said curtly. \"The boss is ready for\nyou.\"\n\nNolan stood up cautiously. His feet were shaky, but he could use\nthem. He stepped over the rounded sill and followed the Venusian's\ndirections. There were men in the corridor, some of them in heat\nsuits. Nolan wondered where they were. Neptune was on the other side\nof the sun--could they be as far in as Uranus? How long had he been\nunconscious!\n\n\"Get moving,\" repeated the second, and Nolan moved.\n\nThe blessed stillness! He was grinning to himself as he walked along\nthe corridor, listening for the lethal whine that wasn't there any\nmore. When they got to where Woller, space-suited and bloated, was\ndirecting a crew of men in the moving of a bulky object, Woller noted\nthe grin. He was not pleased.\n\n\"Enjoying yourself, Nolan?\" he asked, unsmiling. \"That will have to\nstop.\"\n\nA grin stayed on Nolan's face, but it was not the same one. It was a\nsavage threat. Woller looked at it, and looked hastily away.\n\n\"Stand him over in the corner,\" he said to the Venusian second. \"I'll\nattend to him right away. Business first.\"\n\nThe second jerked a thumb at the corner formed by the airlock door and\nthe wall of the corridor. Nolan looked in the direction indicated, and\na sudden tic in his brows showed a thought that had come to him. The\nred signal light winked out as he watched; the inner door had closed.\n\nHe stared through the transparency at what was beyond. Darkness was\nall he could see--darkness, and the light-dotted outline of buildings\nin the distance. Just beyond the lock was something that looked like a\nskid, with men's figures around it. His forehead puckered, and his eyes\nreturned to the signal light, now dark--\n\nThe Venusian second watched Nolan limp slowly over to the indicated\nposition. His eyes narrowed. \"Hey, what's the matter?\" he asked surlily.\n\nNolan shook his head. \"Something in my shoe,\" he said. He halted and\nbalanced himself on one foot, poking into the offending footgear. \"A\nbutton, I guess,\" he said as drew out, concealed, something that he\nknew quite well was _not_ a button.\n\nHe breathed a silent prayer, and it was answered. The Venusian grunted\nand turned away. Nolan walked quickly over to the wall, by the lock\nlight, turned and stood surveying the scene without interest. His hands\napparently were linked idly behind him--but behind his back they were\nmoving swiftly, dexterously. A _clink_ of glass sounded, and Nolan\nwinced as a sharp sliver cut his thumb. Then he stood motionless,\nwaiting.\n\nThe men were shock-wrapping a long, casket-like object. To judge by the\ncare they were using, the contents were delicate and the handling would\nbe rough, Nolan noted absently. Explosives, perhaps?\n\nThe last loop of elastic webbing went around it, and the Venusian\nsecond pulled it taut. \"All right,\" he grunted. \"Take it away.\"\n\n\"Lock!\" bawled Woller as the men picked up the bundle. That was Nolan's\nsignal.\n\nAs slowly as he could manage he stepped idly away from the lock, away\nfrom the signal light, hugging the wall.\n\nA deckhand, not troubling to look at the warning light across the\ncorridor--Nolan mentally thanked his gods--touched the release that\nopened the lock door. And--\n\nRavenous flame lashed out from the wall.\n\n\n                                  IV\n\nNolan was in motion before the incandescent gases had died. The\nhalf-dozen men who had been in the corridor were either down on the\nfloor or blindly reeling about. Even without a proton-reflector behind\nit to focus its fierce energies, a pyro charge exploded on unarmored\nmen can do a lot of damage.\n\nNolan blessed the hunch that had warned of trouble, the remembrance\nof an old spacer's trick that had led him to hide a pyro charge in\nhis shoe, back there in the stateroom. Still it had been luck, pure\nand simple, that gave him the chance to open the signal light socket,\ntake out the lume and put the pyro pellet between the contacts. When\nhe'd got out of range and the automatic warning as the lock opened had\ntouched it off--\n\nCatastrophe. He'd known when to close his eyes, where to stand for\nsafety. The others hadn't. And so the others were blind.\n\nHe grabbed a pyro from a writhing wretch on the floor--there was\nhorror in him as he saw the seared face that had once been that of the\nVenusian second. He picked a heat suit out of the cubby, and was into\nit and in the lock before the blinded men who had escaped the full\nflare could recover themselves.\n\nThe lock doors took an eternity to work, but at last he was out in the\ncold, black open. A hasty glance at the landscape told him nothing.\nUranus or Pluto--it had to be one of them. That was all.\n\nA man was just coming out of the skid, perhaps twenty feet away. Nolan\nclicked on his radio, waited for the inevitable question--but it didn't\ncome. The man's transparent faceplate merely turned incuriously to\nNolan for a second, then bent to examination of the fastenings of the\nskid's lock. Nolan turned calmly and strode off along the side of the\nship. When he rounded the stern he broke into a run, heading straight\nout across charred earth to a chain of hummocks that promised shelter.\n\nHow long would pursuit be delayed? Late or soon, it would come. Nolan\nrealized that he had no plan. But he had life, and freedom.\n\nHe topped the first of the hummocks, scrambled down into the trough\nbehind it. He was relatively safe there, as he cautiously elevated his\nhead to examine the ship and what lay behind it.\n\nAlready--it had been scant minutes since the carnage in the lock\ncorridor--the search for him had begun. He saw a perfectly round spot\nof brilliance fall on the side of the ship, then dance away. Through\nthe ice-clear Plutonian night he could make out the figure of a man\nwith a hand light scanning the belly of the ship, looking to see if\nNolan had hidden himself there. They would quickly learn the answer to\nthat--and know what he had done.\n\nBeyond the ship were a few dim lights, distorted by a crystal dome. It\nwas another city--or not quite a city, but a domed settlement out here\nin the wilderness.\n\nWithout warning a sun blossomed on the side of the ship. Nolan stood\nfrozen for a split second, then dropped, cursing. They'd seen him,\nsomehow, had turned the ship's powerful landing beam on him. But how?\n\nA soundless bolt of lightning that splashed against a higher hill\nbehind him drove speculation out of his mind. Nolan frowned. The\nship was armed--he hadn't known that. Installation of pyros in\ninterplanetary craft was the most forbidden thing of the starways. But\nthere was no time for wonder.\n\nAs another blast sheared off the crest of a hill, Nolan, keeping low,\nscuttled away behind the shelter of the hummocks. His only safety was\nin flight. Armor he had none. The frozen gases that comprised the\nhummocks would never stop the dread thrust of a properly-aimed pyro.\n\nHe fled a hundred yards, then waited. Silence. He risked a quick look,\nsaw nothing, retired behind the shelter of the hill to consider. They'd\nsuspended fire--did they think him dead? Did they know he had escaped?\n\nOr was there a hidden danger in this? It might be a ruse. They could be\nwaiting for him to move, to show himself....\n\nNolan shivered, and absently turned up the heat control of his suit. He\nfelt suddenly hopeless. One man against--what? His thoughts, unbidden,\nreverted to the girl he had left in Avalon, and to the sordid fear that\nshe might be what she seemed. Nolan's cheek muscles drew tight, and his\nface hardened. Woller, partly protected by his heat suit, undoubtedly\nhad lived through the instant inferno when the pyro charge went off.\nThat was one more thing against him--the girl. Nolan sighed.\n\nAnd a faint reverberation on the soles of his feet brought him stark\nupright, staring frantically over the sheltering mound of ice. A skid\nwas racing down on him.\n\nBefore he could move its light flared out, spotted him.\n\nAnd a tiny voice within his helmet said, \"Don't move, Nolan. You can't\nget away now. You'll die if you try. Next time you play hide-and-seek\nwith me, Nolan--don't leave your helmet radio on!\"\n\n\n\nIf Woller had burned with rage before, now he was frozen. He was a\nblind man there before Nolan, his eyes swathed in thick white bandages.\nBut the hulking Earthman with the pyro who stood by his side, and lean\nblack Captain Vincennes at the controls, were eyes enough for him.\n\n\"But I wish I could see you myself,\" Woller said softly, his\nfingers drumming idly against the wide fabric arm of his cushioned\npassenger's chair. \"The ship's surgeon says it may be weeks before I\nsee again. If I could afford to keep you alive that long--\" He sighed\nregretfully. \"No, I can't afford it,\" he concluded. \"There are more\nimportant things, though nothing--\" his voice shook but kept its chill\ncalm--\"that would give me more pleasure than to see you die.\"\n\n\"We could save him, Woller,\" Vincennes said. \"Pickle him in a sleep-box\nlike--\"\n\n\"Be still, Vincennes!\" Woller's voice was sharp. \"I'll ask for advice\nwhen I want it!\"\n\nA sleep-box--Nolan remembered suddenly what they were. Small coffins,\nlarge enough for a man, equipped with an atomic-powered generator that\nkept the occupant in a sort of half-death, not breathing or able to\nmove, but capable of existing almost indefinitely without food.\n\nNolan wondered absently what they were doing with sleep-boxes, then\ngave it up. It didn't matter. He cursed the carelessness that had led\nhim to leave the radio on in his suit. It had been simple for the\n_Dragonfly's_ radio-man to tune in on its carrier wave, get a radio\nfix on his position.\n\nThe skid swerved abruptly in a sloppy turn, and the surly earth man at\nthe controls halted it and looked around. \"Okay,\" he grunted. \"Here we\nare.\"\n\nWoller nodded. \"Take me out,\" he ordered. \"Nolan, too.\"\n\nNolan peered out the window. Absorbed in self-recrimination, he hadn't\npaid attention to their trip. He was surprised to find gleaming metal\nall around the skid. They were in a heat lock--they had come to the\ndomed settlement.\n\nThe Martian Vincennes went first. As soon as the pressure gauge showed\nhe was safely outside the Earthman gestured to Nolan. He wedged himself\nwearily into the air chamber, closed the door. He was ready for a break\nwhen the outer portal opened ... but there was no break. Not with\nVincennes and his ready pyro there.\n\nWoller, stumbling and cursing, followed, and the Earthman. Vincennes\nopened the main lock and they went into the dome.\n\nThere were two great ships inside, dimly lighted by a string of pale\nlumes overhead. Nolan looked at the mass of them, at the rodlike\nprojections clustered around the nose, and knew them for what they were.\nWarships!\n\nScaffolding was still around them. They were not yet ready for\nlaunching, not ready for whatever mission of treason Woller had\nplanned them for. But by the look of them the day was close. And Nolan\nwas--awaiting execution.\n\nOne look at Woller's iron countenance under the tape showed that.\nVincennes' hand, tight-knuckled around the butt of his gun, was ample\nconfirmation.\n\nBut the moment had not yet come. Woller said, \"Are they waiting?\"\n\nVincennes' glance sped to a lighted door at the far side of the hangar.\n\"Looks that way,\" he said. \"Shall I attend to Nolan first? He's\ntricky--\"\n\nWoller laughed softly. \"He's used up all his tricks. We'll take him\nwith us, alive. He might come in handy. He's been out of sight for\nthree years now. I'm just a bit curious where he's been. Perhaps it's\nsomewhere we should know about.\"\n\nHe groped for Vincennes' arm, found it. \"Let's go,\" he said. \"We can't\nkeep the chief waiting.\"\n\n\n\nNolan was first through the door. He was in a small room where four or\nfive ordinary-looking people were siting around at ease. One was in\nuniform, the others the perfect example of quite successful businessmen.\n\n\"Is he here yet?\" whispered Woller. The Martian looked around the room\nbefore he answered.\n\n\"Not yet. Cafferty--Lieutenant Brie--Searle--Vremczyk. That's all.\"\n\nThe dumpling-shaped soldier in the gray-green of Pluto's militia stared\nat Woller. \"What the devil's the matter with your face?\" he spluttered.\n\nWoller answered before Vincennes could. \"I had an accident, Brie,\" he\nsnapped. \"Keep your fat nose out of it.\"\n\nThe dumpling turned purple. But he said nothing, and Nolan realized\nWoller's importance in this gathering. This gathering of--what?\n\nNolan looked around quickly, and the answer raced to his brain.\nAn officer of Pluto's defense forces--two or three well-dressed\nmen, apparently wealthy, with something about them that shrieked\n\"politico\"--and Woller, once overlord of the System's greatest\nnews-dissemination agency, still a man of vast influence. It looked\nlike the back room of a political convention--or the gathering of a\ncabal.\n\n_The Junta!_\n\nIt had to be the Junta.\n\nWhat they were saying began to make sense. A tall man in dove gray was\nspeaking.\n\n\"We're not satisfied, candidly,\" he was saying. \"Woller, you've had\nmore money than our resources can afford. Everything you've asked for\nyou got. And what have you to show for it? Three ships--not one of them\nfit to fly.\"\n\nWoller laughed contemptuously. \"Candidly, Cafferty,\" he mimicked,\n\"I don't care how you feel. My money's gone right along with yours.\nWarships cost money.\"\n\n\"So do thousand-acre Martian estates,\" shot the little lieutenant. \"How\nmuch of your money is in these ships--and how much of ours is in your\npockets?\"\n\nWoller turned his blind eyes toward the lieutenant and stood\nmotionless for a second. Then, softly, \"Once again, Brie--keep your fat\nface shut. You are not indispensable.\"\n\nThe pudgy soldier glared and opened his mouth to speak--but an\ninterruption halted the quarrel. The door opened without warning, and\nanother man entered.\n\nWhat he looked like Nolan could not guess. He wore a heat suit with the\nhelmet down. The polar-plastic faceplate was set for one-way vision.\nEven his voice was muffled and distorted as he spoke.\n\n\"Are we all here?\" he asked. The others seemed to note nothing odd\nabout his incognito--did he always disguise himself, Nolan wondered?\n\"Where's Orlando?\"\n\nBrie answered. \"He was on Mars, on the other side of the sun. He's on\nhis way.\"\n\nThe mirror-faced helmet bobbed as its owner nodded. Then it turned\ntoward Nolan. \"What's this?\" he asked, advancing.\n\nVincennes gestured with the pyro. \"His name is Nolan,\" he said. \"He\ntried to get rough with Mr. Woller. He's dangerous.\"\n\n\"Dangerous!\" The blurred voice was angry. \"Then why is he here? We have\nenough danger as it is. Give me that pyro!\"\n\nThis was it, Nolan knew, and he tensed his body for the leap he had\nto attempt, though he knew it was useless. The man in the heat suit\nreached for Vincennes' pyro. In the moment while the gun was passing\nfrom hand to hand there might be a chance....\n\nThere were shouts from outside, and the sound of running feet. The man\nin the heat suit whirled. \"Bolt that door!\" he shouted. \"Bolt it! Now!\"\n\nBrie, dazed for a second, sprang to obey. Then he turned, his plump,\npale face damp with sudden sweat. \"What is this, Chief?\" he asked. \"Are\nwe--is there trouble?\"\n\n_Chief!_ thought Nolan. So this hooded stranger was the leader of the\nconspiracy. Masked, disguised like the bandit chief of a flamboyant\noperetta.\n\nThe Chief was laughing. \"Lots of trouble,\" he answered. The dull\nshouting from outside continued, rising to a crescendo as whoever was\nwithout pounded against the door and found it locked. Then abruptly it\nsubsided. The huge telescreen on the desk buzzed sharply. The solid\nlittle man seated beside it automatically clicked the switch that\nturned it on.\n\n\"Turn it off!\" bellowed the man in the heat suit. But it was already\nworking. The prismatic flare on the screen showed no vision impulses\nwere coming in, showed that whoever was calling was using a sound\ntransmitter only--a portable set like those in a heat suit. A voice\nsaid sharply:\n\n\"Attention, Junta! The man who claims to be the Chief is a masquerader.\nKill him! This is the Chief speaking now!\"\n\n\n                                   V\n\nDoubt sprang into the eyes of every man present. It lasted only a\nsecond--for the masquerader's action proved the charge against him.\n\nHe grappled the pyro from dazed Vincennes, sprang back, fired a warning\nblast that smashed the telescreen.\n\n\"Don't move, anybody!\" he ordered. \"Nolan--take their guns!\"\n\nNolan threw questions to the winds, sped to obey. He found a\nbusiness-like little heat pencil in the inner pockets of the chunky\nman, a pearl-handled burlesque of the service pyro in the gaudy gemmed\nholster Lieutenant Brie dangled from his belt. Nothing else--and his\nsearch was thorough.\n\n\"All set,\" he reported.\n\n\"Good enough. Searle--are there heat suits in this room?\"\n\nThe chunky man looked stricken. He nodded. \"In that locker,\" he said\ndizzily, pointing to the wall.\n\n\"Get them out, Nolan. Give one to every man and put one on yourself.\nThose outside will take their chances.\"\n\nNolan raced to comply. The stillness outside the door was menacing.\nWhile he was dragging the suits out, throwing them at the men, while\nthey were putting them on, the man called Searle was staring at the\nmasquerader with dawning comprehension.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" he whispered. \"Are you--\"\n\nThe man in the heat suit laughed sharply. \"Get your suit on,\" he said.\n\"You know what I'm going to do. All set?\" Every man was garbed, helmets\ndown. \"Ten seconds to seal them. One, two, three--\"\n\nHe counted slowly and Nolan watched him with fascination. At _five_ the\ngauntleted left hand came up to the butt of the pyro, worked the tiny\nchambering lever half a dozen times. Nolan gasped in spite of himself.\nThere were seven lethal pyro charges in the chamber of that gun--enough\nto blast down a mountain!\n\nThe count was finished. Through Nolan's helmet radio, automatically\nturned on, the man's calm voice ordered, \"All right, Nolan. Open the\ndoor and let them in!\"\n\nNolan moved. As his hand was on the lock, just as it turned and the\ndoor swung loosely inward--\n\n_Blam!_ the impostor swung and fired the massive charge in his pyro at\nthe thin wall that kept air and life in the dome!\n\nThey were running over icy ground. At most there was a minute or so of\nadvantage--less, if the men they'd left in the room had other weapons\nconcealed somewhere. And still Nolan didn't know who his savior was.\n\n\"All right, now,\" he panted over the helmet phone. \"Give. Who are you?\"\n\nThe answer was a chuckle, mixed with gasping as the smaller man strove\nto match his speed. \"Tell you later,\" he panted.\n\n\"Hold it!\" Nolan broke in, suddenly recalling the oversight that had\nbeen so disastrous before. \"Don't tell me. Show me--and turn off your\nradio. They've got tracers.\"\n\n\n\nThere was a snort of sudden comprehension from the phone, then silence.\nNolan looked to see the figure spurt into the lead, gesture ahead. They\nwere rounding the dome. The bulk of the _Dragonfly_ appeared, with a\nbig cargo skid drawn up beside it. The gesticulating arm of the other\nman pointed directly at it.\n\nNolan glanced around. There was no one following--yet.\n\nThe men hadn't had weapons, then--and those who had been outside\nwould not be pursuing anybody. He tried to thrust from his mind the\nrecollection of what had happened when the sucking rush of escaping air\nhad thrown wide open the door he had unlocked, and the tug of naked\nvacuum gripped the men behind it. A dozen of them there had been,\nhulking brutes from the flight sheds of a system's blowsiest ports, and\none man in a heat suit, faceplate mirrored like that of the man Nolan\nran beside. It is not pleasant to see a strong man try to shriek in\nagony, and fail because the air has bubbled from his lungs.\n\nThe outer door of the skid was open, and the impostor trotted in. When\nNolan was beside him he leaned on the lock control. Ever so slowly, the\nouter door closed; slowly the inner opened.\n\nThey burst into a chamber where a man was just rising from a\ntelescreen, face contorted with consternation and hate, hand bringing\nup a pyro from a drawer in the chart table.\n\nThe pseudo-chief's gun spoke first, and the head and shoulders of the\nother disappeared in a burst of flame and sickening smoke. There was\nno time for delicacy. Ruthlessly shoving the seared corpse away, the\nstranger dove for the controls, touched the jet keys.\n\nThe ungainly skid shuddered, then drove forward. The stranger opened\nall jets to the limits of their power. Creaking and groaning, the\nskid responded. The dial of the speed indicator showed mounting\nacceleration, far beyond what the ship was designed for.\n\nNolan, clinging with one arm to a floor-bolted chair, threw back his\nhelmet and yelled: \"I'm ready any time! What's the story? Who the devil\nare you?\"\n\nThe impostor waved a hand impatiently. His muffled voice came: \"Take a\nlook in there. There may be more aboard!\"\n\nNolan grimaced and nodded. He picked his way over the jolting floor,\nblaster out, to the threshold. His groping hand encountered the lume\nswitch, flooded the cargo hatch with light. It was almost empty. A few\ncrates, the long casket-like object he had seen in the ship. Nothing\nbehind which a man could hide.\n\nNolan turned to see the masquerader unzipping the folds of his heat\nsuit with one hand while he guided the careening skid with the other.\nHe brought out a tiny black box, opened it to show a key and a lever.\nHe thumbed the lever open, braced the box between his knees, began\ntapping the key rhythmically. A curious shrill staccato came from the\nbox. _Dee dideedeedit didideedit deedeedit deedeedee didee didididit_--\n\nAfter a second he stopped, waited. Then faintly an answer came back\nfrom the box. _Deedeedee dideedidit_--\n\nAnd silence. Satisfied, the man closed the box, slowed the skid to a\npoint where its guidance no longer required complete attention. They\nhad reached the ring of ice hummocks that surrounded Woller's dome. The\nskid bounded over the first rise, zoomed through that trough and the\nnext; then the man kicked the rudder jets. It spun along the trough to\nwhere the hummocks were highest; then he cut the jets.\n\nHe turned to Nolan, threw back his helmet.\n\n\"My God,\" gasped Nolan. \"Pete!\"\n\n\n\nPetersen grinned. \"You called it, boy,\" he admitted. \"Don't I get\naround though?\"\n\nNolan closed his eyes and tightened his grip on the back of his chair.\n\"The story,\" he said. \"Quick.\"\n\nPetersen shrugged. \"How can I tell it quick? It's long.... Maybe if I\ntell you one thing you can fill in the details.\"\n\n\"What's the one thing?\"\n\n\"I work for TPL.\"\n\nTPL--Tri-planet Law! That explained--\n\nNolan exhaled slowly. \"I begin to see,\" he said. \"I always did think\nyou knew too much for a guy that made his living at cards.\"\n\nPetersen laughed. \"My biggest trouble,\" he said wryly. \"I can't win\nat cards. Whatever I do. It's been quite a drawback to my career. You\ncan see how people would get suspicious of a professional gambler who\nalways loses. I had to keep on the move.\"\n\nNolan's brain was beginning to work again. \"But listen,\" he said.\n\"How come you didn't turn me in when you picked me up--right after I\nescaped? If you worked for the Law--\"\n\nPetersen's face grew serious. \"Boy,\" he said, \"you gave us a lot of\ntrouble. You and your escapes. We weren't planning to keep you in\njail, Steve. Any fool could see you were being framed--fixed court,\nsemi-pro witnesses. But TPL couldn't step in, out in the open. We\ndidn't know enough for a showdown. So you were going to be summoned\nto Mars for further questioning. When we found out all you knew you\nwere to be taken care of some way or other. Given a new identity, kept\nundercover until we were ready to move.\"\n\n\"And I jumped the gun.\"\n\nPetersen nodded. \"I was in the neighborhood, heading for Earth. The\nTPL man on the ship called Earth Base; they called me. The ship had\nyou spotted, but they decided not to pick you up. Base figured that if\nyou thought you were being hunted you'd keep yourself under cover and\nwe wouldn't have to bother. And if I picked you up I could pump you\nmyself.\"\n\nNolan grinned. \"How did you do?\"\n\n\"Fine. You talked more than a ventriloquist with a two-tongued\ndummy.... Then you turn up on Pluto, just when things are getting hot.\"\n\n\"After three years of hiding in third-grade ratholes for fear of the\nlaw.\" There was no bitterness in Nolan's voice. Just a calm statement\nof an unpleasant fact.\n\nPetersen's voice was level, too, but his eyes were alert as he watched\nNolan. \"That couldn't be helped, Steve. You know what was at stake.\"\n\nAbruptly the grin returned. \"The whole damned System, that's all,\"\nNolan said a little proudly. \"Well ... go ahead with your story.\"\n\nPetersen shrugged. He looked a little relieved as he spoke. \"You know\nmost of it. Oh--one part you don't know. Woller's daughter--her name's\nAilse--knew about what he was doing. She just found out about it. We\nhad a maid working in her home in Aylette--she didn't generally stay\nwith Woller; they didn't get along.\"\n\nNolan's brows lifted. \"Oh?\"\n\n\"Yep. Ailse was worried silly. She even talked to the maid--not much,\njust enough that we could figure out what was happening. It seemed she\nwas going to confront Woller with what she knew, try to talk him out of\ntreason.\"\n\n\"A real good idea,\" Nolan remarked. \"Knowing Woller--\"\n\n\"That's how we knew where this base was. She told the maid. Oh, you do\nknow where you are, don't you? On Pluto. The wildest section there is,\nnorth of Annihilation Range.\"\n\n\"How about this cockeyed disguise of yours? Who is this Chief you were\nsupposed to be?\"\n\n\n\nPetersen frowned. \"Don't know, exactly,\" he admitted. \"There are\nthree men it could be--they're all connected with the Junta, we're\npretty sure. They're all on Saturn, and we got word that they were\nrendezvousing here. We knew the boss kept his identity hidden by\nwearing this get-up, so I was detailed to cut in.\"\n\nNolan nodded. Then, his thoughts reverting, he said. \"Where's\nthe--where's Ailse now?\"\n\nPetersen looked unhappy. \"Uh--I don't know. After you left we sent for\nher, just to see what she knew that might help. The maid went after\nher--and couldn't find her. She'd gone out of town, wasn't expected\nback for some time. We couldn't wait. All the leaders of the Junta\nmeeting here--it was too big a chance.\"\n\nNolan said, \"Well, what are we doing about it? They're all there, and\nthey're warned. And we're out here, parked on the edge of nowhere,\nwaiting for them to get up a scout party and grab us.\"\n\nPetersen turned to look out the window in the direction of the dome. He\nscanned the skies carefully, then pursed his lips.\n\n\"Well, no, Steve,\" he said, pointing. \"Take a look.\"\n\nArrowing lines of fire were swooping down from far into the blackness.\nThree trails of white flame showed where three ships were plummeting to\nthe surface. Nolan turned to Petersen with a startled question in his\neyes.\n\n\"Watch,\" Petersen advised. \"This'll be worth seeing!\"\n\nDown and down they drove, faster than meteor ever fell. A mile above\nthe ground the jets behind died, and yellow flame burst ahead of them,\nflaring quickly to white. They slowed, poised, and then, in perfect\nunison, spun off to one side. They came around in a great circle and\ndived at the ground again. And repeated the operation, over and over.\n\nAnd abruptly Nolan saw what was happening. He was witnessing the\nsystematic annihilation of the domed settlement! Immense bursts of\nfire from ship-sized pyros were blazing into the ground. The hummocks\nprevented a dear view, but Nolan could see from the reflected glare on\nthe mountainsides behind that the destruction was frightful.\n\n\"I called them,\" Petersen said softly. \"You saw me call them. That\nblack box--it's a telesonde.\"\n\nNolan didn't turn, fascinated by the sight. \"What's a telesonde?\" he\nasked absently.\n\n\"A radio that carries neither voice nor vision. Only one note\nshort or long depending on how long the key is held down. Your\ngreat-great-grandfather knew about it. It was the first method of\nwireless communication. Now it's so completely forgotten that when\nTPL researchers dug it up it was adopted as the most secret method of\ncommunication available.\"\n\nNolan nodded his head. The ships came around again, and down. This time\nthe forward jets were delayed. When they flared out they persisted,\nwhile the ships dropped gently out of sight. They were landing.\n\nThe destruction of the dome was complete.\n\nNolan turned away. \"Quite a sight,\" he said slowly. \"They deserved to\ndie, of course....\"\n\n\"Steve.\"\n\nNolan's eyes narrowed suddenly. He looked at Petersen. \"Yes?\"\n\n\n\nPetersen, for once, seemed almost at a loss for words. He licked his\nlips before he spoke. \"Steve--there are one or two other things. Did\nyou know that Ailse wasn't Woller's daughter by blood?\"\n\nNolan looked at him unbelievingly. \"Not his daughter?\"\n\nPetersen shook his head. \"Woller married a widow. A wealthy one, with a\ndaughter. They didn't get along too well. The woman died. Some people\nthought it might be suicide.\"\n\nThe quick joy flooded up in Nolan. Petersen saw it and his face\ngrew somber. \"That's one of the things, Steve,\" he said. \"The other\none--Hell, this is hard to say.\"\n\nNolan stood up and the joy was gone from his face. \"Damn you, Pete,\"\nhe said emotionlessly. \"Don't break things gently to me.\"\n\nPetersen shrugged. \"Ailse wasn't anywhere we could find her--and we\nknow a lot of places to look in. The ship left to come here. She was at\nWoller's home till just before then. Woller sent men to bring something\nfrom his apartment to the ship. I thought it was papers at the\ntime--but it could have been a girl. So--where does that leave Ailse?\"\n\nWhere? Nolan stood rocklike as the thought trickled through the\nautomatic barrier his mind had set up. Where did it leave Ailse?\n\nA charred fragment of what had once been beauty. A castoff target for\nTPL's searching pyros.\n\n\"I'll say it again, Steve. You know what was at stake. If the Junta had\ntime--Well, we didn't know what kind of weapons they had there. That\nwas one reason why I was sent ahead in that crazy disguise. If I had\nhad time to scout around it might have been possible to do things less\nbloodily. I didn't have time. We couldn't take chances.\"\n\nThere was no anger in Nolan, no room for it. He sat there, waiting for\nPetersen to start the jets and send them back to the dome. He knew how\nhe would scour the ashes, hoping against hope. And he knew what he\nwould find.\n\nIt would have been better, he thought, almost to have died under\nWoller's pyro, or the TPL ships'. If he'd stayed behind--if Woller had\nput him in the sleep-box as Vincennes had suggested, and he had shared\nobliteration with her....\n\nThe sleep-box! The casket!\n\n\n\nIt took Petersen a full second to recover from his surprise when the\nfrozen face of Nolan suddenly glowed with hope, when he leaped up and\ndashed into the cargo hatch. It took him minutes to follow him. Minutes\nspent in making the difficult decision of whether or not he should\nprevent a man from taking his own life.\n\nThe decision was wasted, he found. Behind the scattered boxes of pyro\nshells, wedged into a corner of the hold, Nolan knelt beside a long,\nnarrow casket. Fiber shock-wrapping was scattered about. Nolan's\nfumbling fingers were working the latch of the casket, lifting the\nlid....\n\nThe shout that left his lips was deafening in the small hold. Petersen\nlooked closer, tiptoed up--\n\nAnd all the way back to the waiting ships of the TPL Petersen was\ngrinning to himself.
