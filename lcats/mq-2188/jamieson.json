    "body": "They lived in a small house beside the little Wolf river in Wisconsin.\nOnce it had been a summer cottage owned by a rich man from Chicago.\nThe rich man died. His heirs sold it. Now it was well insulated and\nMrs. Jamieson and her son were very comfortable, even in the coldest\nwinter. During the summer they rented a few row boats to vacationing\nfishermen, and she had built a few overnight cabins beside the road.\nThey were able to make ends meet.\n\nHer neighbors knew nothing of the money she had brought with her to\nWisconsin. They didn't even know that she was not a native. She never\nspoke of it, except at first, when Earl was a boy of seven and they had\njust come there to live. Then she only said that she came from the\nEast. She knew the names of eastern Wisconsin towns, and small facts\nabout them; it lent an air of authenticity to her claim of being a\nnative. Actually her previous residence was Bangkok, Siam, where the\nAgents had killed her husband.\n\nThat was back in '07, on the eve of his departure for Alpha Centaurus;\nbut she never spoke of this; and she was very careful not to move from\nplace to place except by the conventional methods of travel.\n\nAlso, she wore her hair long, almost to the shoulders. People said,\n\"There goes one of the old-fashioned ones. That hair-do was popular\nback in the sixties.\" They did not suspect that she did this only to\ncover the thin, pencil-line scar, evidence that a small cylinder lay\nunder her skin behind the ear.\n\nFor Mrs. Jamieson was one of the Konvs.\n\nHer husband had been one of the small group who developed this tiny\ninstrument. Not the inventor--_his_ name was Stinson, and the effects\nproduced by it were known as the Stinson Effect. In appearance\nit resembled a small semi-conductor device. Analysis by the best\nscientific minds proved it to be a semi-conductor.\n\nYet it held the power to move a body instantly from one point in space\nto any other point. Each unit was custom built, keyed to operate only\nby the thought pattern of the particular individual.\n\nSeveral times in the past seven years Mrs. Jamieson had seen other\nKonvs, and had been tempted to identify herself and say, \"Here I am.\nYou are one of them; so am I. Come, and we'll talk. We'll talk about\nStinson and Benjamin, who helped them all get away. And Doctor Straus.\nAnd my husband, E. Mason Jamieson, who never got away because those\nfilthy, unspeakable Agents shot him in the back, there in that coffee\nshop in Bangkok, Siam.\"\n\n\n\nOnce, in the second year after her husband's death, an Agent came and\nstayed in one of her cabins.\n\nShe learned that he was an Agent completely by accident. While cleaning\nthe cabin one morning his badge fell out of a shirt pocket. She stood\nstill, staring at the horror of it there on the floor, the shirt in\nher hands, all the loneliness returning in a black wave of hate and\nfrustration.\n\nThat night she soundlessly lifted the screen from the window over his\nbed and shot him with a .22 rifle.\n\nShe threw the weapon into the river. It helped very little. He was one\nAgent, only one out of all the thousands of Agents all over Earth;\nwhile her husband had been one of twenty-eight persons. She decided\nthen that her efforts would be too ineffective. The odds were wrong.\nShe would wait until her son, Earl, was grown.\n\nTogether they would seek revenge. He did not have the cylinder--not\nyet. But he would. The Konvs took care of their own.\n\nHer husband had been one of the first, and they would not forget. One\nday the boy would disappear for a few hours. When he returned the small\npatch of gauze would be behind his ear. She would shield him until the\nopening healed. Then no one would ever know, because now they could do\nit without leaving the tell-tale scar. Then they would seek revenge.\n\nLater they would go to Alpha Centaurus, where a life free from Agents\ncould be lived.\n\nIt happened to Earl one hot summer day when he was fourteen. Mrs.\nJamieson was working in her kitchen; Earl supposedly was swimming with\nhis friends in the river. Suddenly he appeared before her, completely\nnude. At sight of his mother his face paled and he began to shake\nviolently, so that she was forced to slap him to prevent hysteria. She\nlooked behind his ear.\n\nIt was there.\n\n\"Mom!\" he cried. \"Mom!\"\n\nHe went to the window and looked out toward the river, where his\nfriends were still swimming in the river, with great noise and delight.\nApparently they did not miss him. Mrs. Jamieson handed him a pair of\ntrousers. \"Here, get yourself dressed. Then we'll talk.\"\n\n\n\nHe started for his room, but she stopped him. \"No, do it right here.\nYou may as well get used to it now.\"\n\n\"Get used to what?\"\n\n\"To people seeing you nude.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Never mind. What happened just now?\"\n\n\"I was swimming in the river, and a man came down to the river. His\nhair was all white, and his eyes looked like ... well, I never saw eyes\nlike his before. He asked who was Earl Jamieson, and I said I was. Then\nhe said, 'Come with me.' I went with him. I don't know why. It seemed\nthe right thing. He took me to a car and there was another man in it,\nthat looked like the first one only he was bigger. We went to a house,\nnot far away and went inside. And that's all I can remember until I\nwoke up. I was on a table, sort of. A high table. There was a light\nover it. It was all strange, and the two men stood there talking in\nsome language I don't know.\"\n\nEarl ran his hand through his hair, shaking his head. \"I don't remember\nclearly, I guess. I was looking around the room and I remember thinking\nhow scared I was, and how nice it would be to be here with you. And\nthen I was here.\"\n\nEarl faced the window, looking out, then turned quickly back. \"What is\nit?\" he asked, desperately. \"What happened to me?\"\n\n\"Better put your trousers on,\" Mrs. Jamieson said. \"It's something very\nunusual and terrible to think of at first, but really wonderful.\"\n\n\"But what happened? What is this patch behind my ear?\"\n\nSuddenly his face paled and he stopped in the act of getting into his\ntrousers. \"Guess I know now. They made me a Konv.\"\n\n\"Well, don't take on so. You'll get used to it.\"\n\n\"But they shouldn't have! They didn't even ask me!\"\n\nHe started for the door, but she called him back. \"No, don't run away\nfrom it now. This is the time to face it. There are two sides to every\nstory, you know. You hear only one side in school--their side. There is\nalso _our_ side.\"\n\nHe turned back, a dawning comprehension showing in his eyes. \"That's\nright, you're one, too. That is why you killed that Agent in the third\ncabin.\"\n\nIt was her turn to be surprised. \"You knew about that?\"\n\n\"I saw you. I wasn't sleeping. I was afraid to stay inside alone, so I\nfollowed you. I never told anyone.\"\n\n\"But you were only nine!\"\n\n\"They would have taken you away if I'd said anything.\"\n\nMrs. Jamieson held out her hand. \"Come here, son. It's time I told you\nabout us.\"\n\n\n\nSo he sat across the kitchen table from her, and she told the whole\nhistory, beginning with Stinson sitting in the laboratory in New\nJersey, holding in his hand a small cylinder moulded from silicon\nwith controlled impurities. He had made it, looking for a better\nmicro-circuit structure. He was holding this cylinder ... and it was a\ncold day outside ... and he was dreaming of a sunny Florida beach--\n\nAnd suddenly he was there, on the beach. He could not believe it at\nfirst. He felt the sand and water, and felt of himself; there was no\nmistake.\n\nOn the plane back to New Jersey he came to certain conclusions\nregarding the strange power of his device. He tried it again, secretly.\nThen he made more cylinders. He was the only man in the world who\nknew how to construct it, and he kept the secret, giving cylinders\nto selected people. He worked out the basic principle, calling it a\nkinetic ordinate of negative vortices, which was very undefinitive.\n\nIt was a subject of wonder and much speculation, but no one took\nserious notice of them until one night a federal Agent arrested one man\nfor indecency. It was a valid charge. One disadvantage of this method\nof travel was that, while a body could travel instantaneously to any\nchosen spot, it arrived without clothes.\n\nThe arrested man disappeared from his jail cell, and the next morning\nthe Agent was found strangled to death in his bed. This set off a\ncampaign against Konvs. One base act led to another, until the original\nreason for noticing them at all was lost. Normal men no longer thought\nof them as human.\n\nMrs. Jamieson told how Stinson, knowing he had made too many cylinders\nand given them unwisely, left Earth for Alpha Centaurus.\n\nHe went alone, not knowing if he could go so far, or what he would find\nwhen he arrived. But he did arrive, and it was what he had sought.\n\nHe returned for the others. They gathered one night in a dirty,\nbroken-down farmhouse in Missouri--and disappeared in a body, leaving\nthe Agents standing helplessly on Earth, shaking their fists at the sky.\n\n\"You have asked many times,\" Mrs. Jamieson said, \"how your father\ndied. Now I will tell you the truth. Your father was one of the great\nones, along with Stinson and Benjamin and Dr. Straus. He helped plan\nthe escape; but the Agents found him in Bangkok fifteen minutes before\nthe group left. They shot him in the back, and the others had to go on\nwithout him. Now do you know why I killed the Agent in the third cabin?\nI had to. Your father was a great man, and I loved him.\"\n\n\"I don't blame you, mother,\" Earl said simply. \"But we are freaks.\nEverybody says, 'Konv' as if it is something dirty. They write it on\nthe walls in rest rooms.\"\n\n\"Of course they do--because they don't understand! They are afraid of\nus. Wouldn't you be afraid of someone who could do the things we do, if\nyou _couldn't_ do them?\"\n\nJust like that, it was over.\n\nThat is, the first shock was over. Mrs. Jamieson watched Earl leave the\nhouse, walking slowly along the river, a boy with a man's problems.\nHis friends called to him from the river, but he chose not to hear.\nHe wanted to be alone. He needed to think, to feel the newness of the\nthing.\n\nPerhaps he would cross the river and enter the deep forest there. When\nthe initial shock wore off he might experiment with his new power. He\nwould not travel far, in these first attempts. Probably he would stay\nwithin walking distance of his clothes, because he still lacked the\ntricks others had learned.\n\nIt was a hot, mucky afternoon with storm clouds pushing out of the\nwest. Mrs. Jamieson put on her swimming suit and wandered down to the\nriver to cool herself.\n\n\n\nFor the remainder of that summer they worked together. They practiced\nat night mostly, taking longer and longer jumps, until Earl's\nconfidence allowed him to reach any part of the Earth he chose. She\nknew the habits of Agents. She knew how to avoid them.\n\nThey would select a spot sufficiently remote to insure detection, she\nwould devise some prank to irritate the Agents; then they would quickly\nreturn to Wisconsin. The Agents would rush to the calculated spot, but\nwould find only the bare footprints of a woman and a boy. They would\nswear and drive back to their offices to dig through files, searching\nfor some clue to their identity.\n\nIt was inevitable that they should identify Mrs. Jamieson as one of\nthe offenders, since they had discovered, even before Stinson took his\ngroup to Centaurus, that individuals had thought patterns peculiar to\nthemselves. These could be identified, if caught on their detectors,\nand even recorded for the files. But the files proved confusing, for\nthey said that Mrs. Jamieson had gone to Centaurus with the others.\n\nHad she returned to Earth? The question did not trouble them long. They\nhad more serious problems. Stinson had selected only the best of the\nKonvs when he left Earth, leaving all those with criminal tendencies\nbehind. They could have followed if they chose--what could stop them?\nBut it was more lucrative to stay. On Earth they could rob, loot, even\nmurder--without fear of the law.\n\nEarl changed.\n\nEven before the summer was over, he matured. The childish antics of his\nfriends began to bore him. \"Be careful, Earl,\" his mother would say.\n\"Remember who you are. Play with them sometimes, even if you don't like\nit. You have a long way to go before you will be ready.\"\n\nDuring the long winter evenings, after they had watched their favorite\nvideo programs, they would sit by the fireplace. \"Tell me about the\ngreat ones,\" he would say, and she would repeat all the things she\nremembered about Stinson and Benjamin and Straus. She never tired of\ndiscussing them. She would tell about Benjamin's wife, Lisa, and try to\ndescribe the horror in Lisa's young mind when the news went out that\nE. Mason Jamieson had been killed. She wanted him to learn as much as\npossible about his father's death, knowing that soon the Agents would\nbe after Earl. They were so clever, so persistent. She wanted him to be\nready, not only in ways of avoiding their traps ... but ready with a\nheart full of hate.\n\nSometimes when she talked about her husband, Mrs. Jamieson wanted to\nstand up and scream at her son, \"Hate, hate! Hate! You must learn to\nhate!\" But she clenched her hands over her knitting, knowing that he\nwould learn it faster if she avoided the word.\n\n\n\nThe winter passed, and the next summer, and two more summers.\n\nEarl was ready for college. They had successfully kept their secret.\nThey had been vigilant in every detail. Earl referred to the \"damn\nAgents\" now with a curl of his lip. They had been successful in\ncontacting other Konvs, and sometimes visited them at a remote\nrendezvous.\n\n\"When you have finished college,\" Mrs. Jamieson told her son, \"we will\ngo to Centaurus.\"\n\n\"Why not now?\"\n\n\"Because when you get there they will need men who can contribute to\nthe development of the planet. Stinson is a physicist, Benjamin a\nmetallurgist, Straus a doctor. But Straus is an old man by this time. A\nyoung doctor will be needed. Study hard, Earl. Learn all you can. Even\nthe great ones get sick.\"\n\nShe did not mention her secret hope, that before they left Earth\nhe would have fully avenged his father's death. He was clever and\nintelligent.\n\nHe could kill many Agents.\n\nSo she exhumed the money she had hidden more than ten years before.\nThe house beside the Little Wolf river was sold. They found a modest\nbungalow within walking distance of the University's medical school.\nMrs. Jamieson furnished it carefully but, oddly, rather lavishly.\n\nThis was her husband's money she was spending now. It needed to last\nonly a few years. Then they would leave Earth forever.\n\nA room was built on the east side of the bungalow, with its own private\nentrance. This was Earl's room. Ostensibly the private entrance was for\nconvenience due to the irregular hours of college students.\n\nIt was also convenient for coming home late at night after Agent\nhunting.\n\nMrs. Jamieson was becoming obvious.\n\nExcitement brought color to her cheeks when she thought of Earl facing\none of them--a lean, cunning jaguar facing a fat, lazy bear. It was her\nnotion that federal Agents were evil creatures, tools of a decadent,\nbloodthirsty society, living off the fat of the land.\n\nShe painted the room herself, in soft, pastel colors. When it was\nfinished she showed Earl regally into the room, making a big joke of it.\n\n\"Here you can study and relax, and have those bull sessions students\nare always having,\" she said.\n\n\"There will be no friends,\" he answered, \"not here. No Konvs will be at\nthe university.\"\n\n\"Why not? Stinson selected only educated, intelligent people. When\none dies the cylinder is taken and adjusted to a new thought\npattern--usually a person from the same family. I would say it is very\nlikely that Konvs will be found here.\"\n\n\n\nHe shook his head. \"No. They knew we were coming, and no one said a\nword about others being here. I'm afraid we are alone.\"\n\n\"Well, I think not,\" she said firmly. \"Anyway, the room will be\ncomfortable.\"\n\nHe shook his head again. \"Why can't I be in the house with you? There\nare two bedrooms.\"\n\nShe said quickly, \"You can if you wish. I just thought you'd like being\nalone, at your age. Most boys do.\"\n\n\"I'm not like most boys, mother. The Konvs saw to that. Sometimes I'm\nsorry. Back in high school I used to wish I was like the others. Do you\nremember Lorane Peters?\" His mother nodded. \"Well, when we were seniors\nlast year she liked me quite a lot. She didn't say so, but I knew it.\nShe would sit across the aisle from me, and sometimes when I saw how\nher hair fell over her face when she read, I wanted to lean over and\nwhisper to her, 'Hey, Lorrie--' just as if I was human--'can I take you\nto the basketball game?'\"\n\nMrs. Jamieson turned to leave the room, but he stopped her. \"You\nunderstand what I'm saying, don't you?\"\n\n\"No, I don't!\" she said sharply. \"You're old enough to face realities.\nYou are a Konv. You always will be a Konv. _Have you forgotten your own\nfather?_\"\n\nShe turned her back and slammed the door. Earl stood very still for\na long time in the room that was to have been happy for him. She was\ncrying just beyond the wall.\n\nEarl did not use the room that first year. He slept in the second\nbedroom. He did not mention his frustrated desires to be normal, not\nafter the first attempt, but he persisted in his efforts to be so. Use\nof the cylinder was out of the question for them now, anyway.\n\nIn the spring Mrs. Jamieson caught a virus cold which resulted in a\nlong convalescence. Earl moved into the new bedroom. At first she\nthought he moved in an effort to please her because of the illness, but\nshe soon grew aware of her mistake.\n\nOne day he disappeared.\n\n\n\nMrs. Jamieson was alarmed. Had the Agents found him? She watched the\npapers daily for some word of Konvs being killed.\n\nThe second day after his disappearance she found a small item. A Konv\nhad raided the Agent's office in Stockholm, killing three, and getting\nkilled himself. Mrs. Jamieson dropped the paper immediately and went\nto Stockholm. She did not consider the risk. In Stockholm she found\nclothes and made discreet inquiries. The slain man had been a Finnish\nKonv, one of those left behind by Stinson as an undesirable. His wife\nhad been killed by the Agents the week before. He had gone completely\ninsane and made the raid singlehanded. Mrs. Jamieson read the account\nof crimes committed by the man and his wife, and determined to prevent\nEarl from making the mistake of taking on more than he could handle.\n\nWhen she arrived at her own home, Earl was in his room.\n\n\"Where have you been?\" she asked petulantly.\n\n\"Oh, here and there.\"\n\n\"I thought you were involved in that fight in Stockholm.\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\nShe stood in the doorway and watched him leaning over his desk,\nattempting to write something on a sheet of paper. She was proud of his\nprofile, tow-headed as a boy, handsome in a masculine way. He cracked\nhis knuckles nervously.\n\n\"What did you do?\" she asked.\n\nSuddenly he flung the pencil down, jumped from his chair and paced the\nfloor. \"I talked to an Agent last night,\" he said.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Bangkok.\"\n\nMrs. Jamieson had to sit down. Finally she was able to ask, \"How did it\nhappen?\"\n\n\"I broke into the office there to get at the records. He caught me.\"\n\n\"What were you looking for?\"\n\n\"I wanted to learn the names of the men who killed Father.\" He said the\nword strangely. He was unaccustomed to it.\n\n\"Did you find them?\"\n\nHe pointed to the paper on his desk. Mrs. Jamieson, trembling, picked\nit up and read the names. Seeing them there, written like any other\nnames would be written, made her furious. How could they? How could the\nnames of murderers look like ordinary names? When she thought them in\nher mind, they even sounded like ordinary names--and they shouldn't!\nShe had always thought that those names, if she ever saw them, would\nbe filthy, unholy scratches on paper, evil sounds, like the rustle of\nbedclothes to a jealous lover listening at a keyhole. \"Tom Palieu\"\ndidn't sound evil; neither did \"Al Jonson.\" She was shaken by this more\nthan she would permit Earl to see.\n\n\n\n\"Why did you want the names?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said. \"Curiosity, maybe, or a subconscious desire\nfor revenge. I just wanted to see them.\"\n\n\"Tell me what happened! If an Agent saw you ... well, either he killed\nyou or you killed him. But you're here alive.\"\n\n\"I didn't kill him. That's what seems so strange. And he didn't try to\nkill me. We didn't even fight. He didn't ask why I broke in without\nbreaking the lock or even a window. He seemed to know. He did ask what\nI was doing there, and who I was. I told him, and ... he helped me get\nthe names. He asked where I lived. 'None of your damn business,' I told\nhim. Then he said he didn't blame me for not telling, that Konvs must\nfear Agents, and hate them. Then he said, 'Do you know why we kill\nKonvs? We kill them because there is no prison cell in the world that\nwill hold a Konv. When they break the law, we have no choice. It is a\nterrible thing, but must be done. We don't want your secret; we only\nwant law and order. There is room enough in the world for both of us.'\"\n\nMrs. Jamieson was furious. \"And you believed him?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I just know what he said--and that he let me go without\ntrying to shoot me.\"\n\nMrs. Jamieson stopped on her way out of the room and laid a hand on his\narm. \"Your father would have been proud of you,\" she said. \"Soon you\nwill learn the truth about the Agents.\"\n\nBeyond the closed door, out of sight of her son, Mrs. Jamieson gave\nrein to the excitement that ran through her. He had wanted the names!\nHe didn't know why--not yet--but he would. \"He'll do it yet!\" she\nwhispered to the flowered wallpaper. She didn't care that no one heard\nher.\n\nShe didn't know where the men were now, those who had killed her\nhusband. They could be anywhere. Agents moved from post to post; in ten\nyears they might be scattered all over Earth. In the killing of Konvs,\nsome cylinders might even be taken by Agents--and used by them, for\nthe power and freedom the cylinders gave must be coveted even by them.\nAnd they were in the best position to gain them. She was consumed by\nfear that one or more of the men on Earl's list might have acquired a\ncylinder and were now Konvs themselves.\n\n\n\nTwo weeks later she read a news item saying that Tom Palieu had been\nkilled by a Konv. The assassin's identity was unknown, but agents were\nworking on the case.\n\nShe knew. She had found a gun in Earl's desk.\n\nShe took the paper into Earl's room. \"Did you do this?\"\n\nHe turned away from her. \"It doesn't matter whether I did or not. They\nwill suspect me. His name was on the list.\"\n\n\"They will,\" she agreed. \"It doesn't matter who the Konv is, now that\nan Agent has been killed. The one in Bangkok will tell them about you\nand the list of names, and it's all they need.\"\n\n\"Well, what else can he do?\" Earl asked. \"After all, he is an Agent.\nIf one of them is killed, he will have to tell what he knows.\"\n\n\"You're defending him? Why?\" she cried. \"Tell me why!\"\n\nHe removed her hand from his arm. Her nails were digging into his\nflesh. \"I don't know why. Mother, I'm sorry, but Agents are just people\nto me. I can't hate them the way you do.\"\n\nMrs. Jamieson's face colored, then drained white.\n\nSuddenly, with a wide, furious sweep of her hand, she slapped his face.\nSo much strength and rage was in her arm that the blow almost sent him\nspinning. They faced each other, she breathing hard from the exertion,\nEarl stunned immobile--not by the blow, but from the knowledge that she\ncould hate so suddenly, viciously.\n\nShe controlled herself. \"We must find a way to leave here,\" she said,\ncalmly.\n\n\"They won't find us.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes they will,\" she said. \"Don't underestimate them. Agents are\npicked from the most intelligent people on Earth. It will be a small\njob for them. Don't forget they know who you are. Even if you hadn't\nbeen so stupid as to tell them, they'd know. They knew my pattern from\nthe time your father was alive. They got yours when we were together\nyears ago, teasing them. They linked your pattern with mine. They know\nthat your father and I had a son. Your birth was recorded. The only\ndifficult aspect of their job now is to find where you live, and it\nwon't be impossible. They will drive their cars through every city on\nEarth with those new detectors, until they pick up your pattern or\nmine. I'm afraid it's time to leave Earth.\"\n\n\n\nEarl sat down suddenly, \"It's just as well. I thought maybe some day I\nmight hate them too, or learn to like them. But I can do neither, so I\nam halfway between, and no man can live this way.\"\n\nShe did not answer him. Finally he said, \"It doesn't make sense to you,\ndoes it?\"\n\n\"No, it doesn't. This is not the time for such discussions, anyway. The\nAgents have their machines working at top speed, while we sit here and\ntalk.\"\n\nSuddenly they were not alone.\n\nNo sound was generated by the man's coming. One instant they were\ntalking alone, the next he was here. Earl saw him first. He was a\nmiddle-aged man whose hair was completely white. He stood near the\ndesk, easily, as if standing there were the most natural way to relax.\nHe was entirely nude ... but it seemed natural and right.\n\nThen Mrs. Jamieson saw him.\n\n\"Benjamin!\" she cried. \"I knew someone would come.\"\n\nHe smiled. \"This is your son?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"We are ready.\"\n\n\"I remember when you were born,\" he said, and smiled in reminiscence.\n\"Your father was afraid you would be twins.\"\n\nEarl said, \"Why was my father killed?\"\n\n\"By mistake. Back in those days, like now, there were good Konvs and\nbad. One of those not selected by Stinson to join us was enraged, half\ncrazy with envy. He killed two women there in Bangkok. The Agents\nthought Jamieson--I mean, your father--did it. Jamieson was the\ngreatest man among us. It was he who first conceived the theory that\nthere was a basic, underlying law in the operation of the cylinders.\nEven now, no one knows how the idea of love ties in with the Stinson\nEffect; but we do know that hate and greed as motivating forces can\ngreatly minimize the cylinders' power. That is why the undesirables\nwith cylinders have never reached Centaurus.\"\n\nHeavy steps sounded on the porch outside.\n\n\"We'd better hurry,\" Mrs. Jamieson said.\n\nBenjamin held out his hands. They took them, to increase the power of\nthe cylinders. As the Agents pounded on the door, Mrs. Jamieson flicked\none thought of hatred at them, but of course they did not hear her.\nBenjamin's hands gripped tightly.\n\nMrs. Jamieson slowly opened her eyes....\n\nShe no longer felt the hands. _She was still in the room!_ Benjamin and\nher son were gone. Her outstretched hands touched nothing.\n\nHer power was gone!\n\nThe Agents stepped into the room over the broken door. She stared at\nthem, then ran to Earl's desk, fumbling for the gun.\n\nThe Agents' guns rattled.\n\nLove, Benjamin said, the greatest of these is love. Or did someone\nelse say that? Someone, somewhere, perhaps in another time, in some\nmisty, forgotten chip of time long gone, in another frame of reference\nperhaps....\n\nMrs. Jamieson could not remember, before she died.",
