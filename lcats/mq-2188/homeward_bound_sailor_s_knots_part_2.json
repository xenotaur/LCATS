    "body": "1909\n\n\n\nHOMEWARD BOUND\n\n\nMr. Hatchard's conversation for nearly a week had been confined to fault-\nfinding and grunts, a system of treatment designed to wean Mrs. Hatchard\nfrom her besetting sin of extravagance.  On other occasions the treatment\nhad, for short periods, proved successful, but it was quite evident that\nhis wife's constitution was becoming inured to this physic and required a\nchange of treatment.  The evidence stared at him from the mantelpiece in\nthe shape of a pair of huge pink vases, which had certainly not been\nthere when he left in the morning.  He looked at them and breathed\nheavily.\n\n\"Pretty, ain't they?\" said his wife, nodding at them.\n\n\"Who gave 'em to you?\" inquired Mr. Hatchard, sternly.\n\nHis wife shook her head.  \"You don't get vases like that given to you,\"\nshe said, slowly.  \"Leastways, I don't.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say you bought 'em?\" demanded her husband.\n\nMrs. Hatchard nodded.\n\n\"After all I said to you about wasting my money?\" persisted Mr. Hatchard,\nin amazed accents.\n\nMrs. Hatchard nodded, more brightly than before.\n\n\"There has got to be an end to this!\" said her husband, desperately.\n\"I won't have it!  D'ye hear?  I won't--have--it!\"\n\n\"I bought 'em with my own money,\" said his wife, tossing her head.\n\n\"Your money?\" said Mr. Hatchard.  \"To hear you talk anybody 'ud think\nyou'd got three hundred a year, instead o' thirty.  Your money ought to\nbe spent in useful things, same as what mine is.  Why should I spend my\nmoney keeping you, while you waste yours on pink vases and having friends\nin to tea?\"\n\nMrs. Hatchard's still comely face took on a deeper tinge.\n\n\"Keeping me?\" she said, sharply.  \"You'd better stop before you say\nanything you might be sorry for, Alfred.\"\n\n\"I should have to talk a long time before I said that,\" retorted the\nother.\n\n\"I'm not so sure,\" said his wife.  \"I'm beginning to be tired of it.\"\n\n\"I've reasoned with you,\" continued Mr. Hatchard, \"I've argued with you,\nand I've pointed out the error of your ways to you, and it's all no\ngood.\"\n\n\"Oh, be quiet, and don't talk nonsense,\" said his wife.\n\n\"Talking,\" continued Mr. Hatchard, \"as I said before, is no good.  Deeds,\nnot words, is what is wanted.\"\n\nHe rose suddenly from his chair and, taking one of the vases from the\nmantelpiece, dashed it to pieces on the fender.  Example is contagious,\nand two seconds later he was in his chair again, softly feeling a rapidly\ngrowing bump on his head, and gazing goggle-eyed at his wife.\n\n\"And I'd do it again,\" said that lady, breathlessly, \"if there was\nanother vase.\"\n\nMr. Hatchard opened his mouth, but speech failed him.  He got up and left\nthe room without a word, and, making his way to the scullery, turned on\nthe tap and held his head beneath it.  A sharp intake of the breath\nannounced that a tributary stream was looking for the bump down the neck\nof his shirt.\n\nHe was away a long time--so long that the half-penitent Mrs. Hatchard was\nbeginning to think of giving first aid to the wounded.  Then she heard\nhim coming slowly back along the passage.  He entered the room, drying\nhis wet hair on a hand-kerchief.\n\n\"I--I hope I didn't hurt you--much?\"  said his wife.\n\nMr. Hatchard drew himself up and regarded her with lofty indignation.\n\n\"You might have killed me,\" he said at last, in thrilling tones.  \"Then\nwhat would you have done?\"\n\n\"Swept up the pieces, and said you came home injured and died in my\narms,\" said Mrs. Hatchard, glibly.  \"I don't want to be unfeeling, but\nyou'd try the temper of a saint.  I'm sure I wonder I haven't done it\nbefore.  Why I married a stingy man I don't know.\"\n\n\"Why I married at all I don't know,\" said her husband, in a deep voice.\n\n\"We were both fools,\" said Mrs. Hatchard, in a resigned voice; \"that's\nwhat it was.  However, it can't be helped now.\"\n\n\"Some men would go and leave you,\" said Mr. Hatchard.\n\n\"Well, go,\" said his wife, bridling.  \"I don't want you.\"\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense,\" said the other.\n\n\"It ain't nonsense,\" said Mrs. Hatchard.  \"If you want to go, go.\nI don't want to keep you.\"\n\n\"I only wish I could,\" said her husband, wistfully.\n\n\"There's the door,\" said Mrs. Hatchard, pointing.  \"What's to prevent\nyou?\"\n\n\"And have you going to the magistrate?\"  observed Mr. Hatchard.\n\n\"Not me,\" was the reply.\n\n\"Or coming up, full of complaints, to the ware-house?\"\n\n\"Not me,\" said his wife again.\n\n\"It makes my mouth water to think of it,\" said Mr. Hatchard.  \"Four years\nago I hadn't a care in the world.\"\n\n\"Me neither,\" said Mrs. Hatchard; \"but then I never thought I should\nmarry you.  I remember the first time I saw you I had to stuff my\nhandkerchief in my mouth.\"\n\n\"What for?\" inquired Mr. Hatchard.\n\n\"Keep from laughing,\" was the reply.\n\n\"You took care not to let me see you laugh,\" said Mr. Hatchard, grimly.\n\"You were polite enough in them days.  I only wish I could have my time\nover again; that's all.\"\n\n\"You can go, as I said before,\" said his wife.\n\n\"I'd go this minute,\" said Mr. Hatchard, \"but I know what it 'ud be: in\nthree or four days you'd be coming and begging me to take you back\nagain.\"\n\n\"You try me,\" said Mrs. Hatchard, with a hard laugh.  \"I can keep myself.\nYou leave me the furniture--most of it is mine--and I sha'n't worry you\nagain.\"\n\n\"Mind!\"  said Mr. Hatchard, raising his hand with great solemnity.  \"If I\ngo, I never come back again.\"\n\n\"I'll take care of that,\" said his wife, equably.  \"You are far more\nlikely to ask to come back than I am.\"\n\nMr. Hatchard stood for some time in deep thought, and then, spurred on by\na short, contemptuous laugh from his wife, went to the small passage and,\nputting on his overcoat and hat, stood in the parlor doorway regarding\nher.\n\n\"I've a good mind to take you at your word,\" he said, at last.\n\n\"Good-night,\" said his wife, briskly.  \"If you send me your address, I'll\nsend your things on to you.  There's no need for you to call about them.\"\n\nHardly realizing the seriousness of the step, Mr. Hatchard closed the\nfront door behind him with a bang, and then discovered that it was\nraining.  Too proud to return for his umbrella, he turned up his\ncoat-collar and, thrusting his hands in his pockets, walked slowly down\nthe desolate little street.  By the time he had walked a dozen yards he\nbegan to think that he might as well have waited until the morning;\nbefore he had walked fifty he was certain of it.\n\nHe passed the night at a coffee-house, and rose so early in the morning\nthat the proprietor took it as a personal affront, and advised him to get\nhis breakfast elsewhere.  It was the longest day in Mr. Hatchard's\nexperience, and, securing modest lodgings that evening, he overslept\nhimself and was late at the warehouse next morning for the first time in\nten years.\n\nHis personal effects arrived next day, but no letter came from his wife,\nand one which he wrote concerning a pair of missing garments received no\nreply.  He wrote again, referring to them in laudatory terms, and got a\nbrief reply to the effect that they had been exchanged in part payment on\na pair of valuable pink vases, the pieces of which he could have by\npaying the carriage.\n\nIn six weeks Mr. Hatchard changed his lodgings twice.  A lack of those\nhome comforts which he had taken as a matter of course during his married\nlife was a source of much tribulation, and it was clear that his weekly\nbills were compiled by a clever writer of fiction.  It was his first\nexperience of lodgings, and the difficulty of saying unpleasant things to\na woman other than his wife was not the least of his troubles.  He\nchanged his lodgings for a third time, and, much surprised at his wife's\ncontinued silence, sought out a cousin of hers named Joe Pett, and poured\nhis troubles into that gentleman's reluctant ear.\n\n\"If she was to ask me to take her back,\" he concluded, \"I'm not sure,\nmind you, that I wouldn't do so.\"\n\n\"It does you credit,\" said Mr. Pett.  \"Well, ta-ta; I must be off.\"\n\n\"And I expect she'd be very much obliged to anybody that told her so,\"\nsaid Mr. Hatchard, clutching at the other's sleeve.\n\nMr. Pett, gazing into space, said that he thought it highly probable.\n\n\"It wants to be done cleverly, though,\" said Mr. Hatchard, \"else she\nmight get the idea that I wanted to go back.\"\n\n\"I s'pose you know she's moved?\"  said Mr. Pett, with the air of a man\nanxious to change the conversation.\n\n\"Eh?\" said the other.\n\n\"Number thirty-seven, John Street,\" said Mr. Pett.  \"Told my wife she's\ngoing to take in lodgers.  Calling herself Mrs. Harris, after her maiden\nname.\"\n\nHe went off before Mr. Hatchard could recover, and the latter at once\nverified the information in part by walking round to his old house.  Bits\nof straw and paper littered the front garden, the blinds were down, and a\nbill was pasted on the front parlor window.  Aghast at such\ndetermination, he walked back to his lodgings in gloomy thought.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon he walked round to John Street, and from the corner\nof his eye, as he passed, stole a glance at No. 37.  He recognized the\ncurtains at once, and, seeing that there was nobody in the room, leaned\nover the palings and peered at a card that stood on the window-sash:\n\n                       FURNISHED APARTMENTS\n                       FOR SINGLE YOUNG MAN\n                        BOARD IF DESIRED.\n\nHe walked away whistling, and after going a little way turned and passed\nit again.  He passed in all four times, and then, with an odd grin\nlurking at the corners of his mouth, strode up to the front door and\nknocked loudly.  He heard somebody moving about inside, and, more with\nthe idea of keeping his courage up than anything else, gave another heavy\nknock at the door.  It was thrown open hastily, and the astonished face\nof his wife appeared before him.\n\n\"What do you want?\" she inquired, sharply.\n\nMr. Hatchard raised his hat.  \"Good-afternoon, ma'am,\" he said, politely.\n\n\"What do you want?\" repeated his wife.\n\n\"I called,\" said Mr. Hatchard, clearing his throat--\"I called about the\nbill in the window.\"\n\nMrs. Hatchard clutched at the door-post.\n\n\"Well?\"  she gasped.\n\n\"I'd like to see the rooms,\" said the other.\n\n\"But you ain't a single young man,\" said his wife, recovering.\n\n\"I'm as good as single,\" said Mr. Hatchard.  \"I should say, better.\"\n\n\"You ain't young,\" objected Mrs. Hatchard.  \"I'm three years younger than\nwhat you are,\" said Mr. Hatchard, dispassionately.\n\nHis wife's lips tightened and her hand closed on the door; Mr. Hatchard\nput his foot in.\n\n\"If you don't want lodgers, why do you put a bill up?\" he inquired.\n\n\"I don't take the first that comes,\" said his wife.\n\n\"I'll pay a week in advance,\" said Mr. Hatchard, putting his hand in his\npocket.  \"Of course, if you're afraid of having me here--afraid o' giving\nway to tenderness, I mean----\"\n\n\"Afraid?\"  choked Mrs. Hatchard.  \"Tenderness!  I--I----\"\n\n\"Just a matter o' business,\" continued her husband; \"that's my way of\nlooking at it--that's a man's way.  I s'pose women are different.  They\ncan't----\"\n\n\"Come in,\" said Mrs. Hatchard, breathing hard Mr. Hatchard obeyed, and\nclapping a hand over his mouth ascended the stairs behind her.  At the\ntop she threw open the door of a tiny bedroom, and stood aside for him to\nenter.  Mr. Hatchard sniffed critically.\n\n\"Smells rather stuffy,\" he said, at last.\n\n\"You needn't have it,\" said his wife, abruptly.  \"There's plenty of other\nfish in the sea.\"\n\n\"Yes; and I expect they'd stay there if they saw this room,\" said the\nother.\n\n\"Don't think I want you to have it; because I don't,\" said Mrs. Hatchard,\nmaking a preliminary movement to showing him downstairs.\n\n\"They might suit me,\" said Mr. Hatchard, musingly, as he peeped in at the\nsitting-room door.  \"I shouldn't be at home much.  I'm a man that's fond\nof spending his evenings out.\"\n\nMrs. Hatchard, checking a retort, eyed him grimly.\n\n\"I've seen worse,\" he said, slowly; \"but then I've seen a good many.  How\nmuch are you asking?\"\n\n\"Seven shillings a week,\" replied his wife.  \"With breakfast, tea, and\nsupper, a pound a week.\"\n\nMr. Hatchard nearly whistled, but checked himself just in time.\n\n\"I'll give it a trial,\" he said, with an air of unbearable patronage.\n\nMrs. Hatchard hesitated.\n\n\"If you come here, you quite understand it's on a business footing,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"O' course,\" said the other, with affected surprise.  \"What do you think\nI want it on?\"\n\n\"You come here as a stranger, and I look after you as a stranger,\"\ncontinued his wife.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said the other.  \"I shall be made more comfortable that way,\nI'm sure.  But, of course, if you're afraid, as I said before, of giving\nway to tender----\"\n\n\"Tender fiddlesticks!\" interrupted his wife, flushing and eying him\nangrily.\n\n\"I'll come in and bring my things at nine o'clock to-night,\" said Mr.\nHatchard.  \"I'd like the windows open and the rooms aired a bit.  And\nwhat about the sheets?\"\n\n\"What about them?\"  inquired his wife.\n\n\"Don't put me in damp sheets, that's all,\" said Mr. Hatchard.  \"One place\nI was at----\"\n\nHe broke off suddenly.\n\n\"Well!\"  said his wife, quickly.\n\n\"Was very particular about them,\" said Mr. Hatchard, recovering.  \"Well,\ngood-afternoon to you, ma'am.\"\n\n\"I want three weeks in advance,\" said his wife.  \"Three--\" exclaimed the\nother.  \"Three weeks in advance?  Why----\"\n\n\"Those are my terms,\" said Mrs. Hatchard.  \"Take 'em or leave 'em.\nP'r'aps it would be better if you left 'em.\"\n\nMr. Hatchard looked thoughtful, and then with obvious reluctance took his\npurse from one pocket and some silver from another, and made up the\nrequired sum.\n\n\"And what if I'm not comfortable here?\"  he inquired, as his wife hastily\npocketed the money.  \"It'll be your own fault,\" was the reply.\n\nMr. Hatchard looked dubious, and, in a thoughtful fashion, walked\ndownstairs and let himself out.  He began to think that the joke was of\na more complicated nature than he had expected, and it was not without\nforebodings that he came back at nine o'clock that night accompanied by a\nboy with his baggage.\n\nHis gloom disappeared the moment the door opened.  The air inside was\nwarm and comfortable, and pervaded by an appetizing smell of cooked\nmeats.  Upstairs a small bright fire and a neatly laid supper-table\nawaited his arrival.\n\nHe sank into an easy-chair and rubbed his hands.  Then his gaze fell on a\nsmall bell on the table, and opening the door he rang for supper.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Mrs. Hatchard, entering the room.  \"Supper, please,\"\nsaid the new lodger, with dignity.\n\nMrs. Hatchard looked bewildered.  \"Well, there it is,\" she said,\nindicating the table.  \"You don't want me to feed you, do you?\"\n\nThe lodger eyed the small, dry piece of cheese, the bread and butter, and\nhis face fell.  \"I--I thought I smelled something cooking,\" he said at\nlast.\n\n\"Oh, that was my supper,\" said Mrs. Hatchard, with a smile.\n\n\"I--I'm very hungry,\" said Mr. Hatchard, trying to keep his temper.\n\n\"It's the cold weather, I expect,\" said Mrs. Hatchard, thoughtfully;\n\"it does affect some people that way, I know.  Please ring if you want\nanything.\"\n\nShe left the room, humming blithely, and Mr. Hatchard, after sitting for\nsome time in silent consternation, got up and ate his frugal meal.  The\nfact that the water-jug held three pints and was filled to the brim gave\nhim no satisfaction.\n\nHe was still hungry when he arose next morning, and, with curiosity\ntempered by uneasiness, waited for his breakfast.  Mrs. Hatchard came in\nat last, and after polite inquiries as to how he had slept proceeded to\nlay breakfast.  A fresh loaf and a large teapot appeared, and the smell\nof frizzling bacon ascended from below.  Then Mrs. Hatchard came in\nagain, and, smiling benevolently, placed an egg before him and withdrew.\nTwo minutes later he rang the bell.\n\n\"You can clear away,\" he said, as Mrs. Hatchard entered the room.\n\n\"What, no breakfast?\"  she said, holding up her hands.  \"Well, I've heard\nof you single young men, but I never thought----\"\n\n\"The tea's cold and as black as ink,\" growled the indignant lodger, \"and\nthe egg isn't eatable.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you're a bit of a fault-finder,\" said Mrs. Hatchard, shaking\nher head at him.  \"I'm sure I try my best to please.  I don't mind what I\ndo, but if you're not satisfied you'd better go.\"\n\n\"Look here, Emily--\" began her husband.\n\n\"Don't you 'Emily' me!\"  said Mrs. Hatchard, quickly.  \"The idea!  A\nlodger, too!  You know the arrangement.  You'd better go, I think, if you\ncan't behave yourself.\"\n\n\"I won't go till my three weeks are up,\" said Mr. Hatchard, doggedly, \"so\nyou may as well behave yourself.\"\n\n\"I can't pamper you for a pound a week,\" said Mrs. Hatchard, walking to\nthe door.  \"If you want pampering, you had better go.\"\n\nA week passed, and the additional expense caused by getting most of his\nmeals out began to affect Mr. Hatchard's health.  His wife, on the\ncontrary, was in excellent spirits, and, coming in one day, explained the\nabsence of the easy-chair by stating that it was wanted for a new lodger.\n\n\"He's taken my other two rooms,\" she said, smiling--\"the little back\nparlor and the front bedroom--I'm full up now.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't he like my table, too?\"  inquired Mr. Hatchard, with bitter\nsarcasm.\n\nHis wife said that she would inquire, and brought back word next day that\nMr. Sadler, the new lodger, would like it.  It disappeared during Mr.\nHatchard's enforced absence at business, and a small bamboo table, weak\nin the joints, did duty in its stead.\n\nThe new lodger, a man of middle age with a ready tongue, was a success\nfrom the first, and it was only too evident that Mrs. Hatchard was trying\nher best to please him.  Mr. Hatchard, supping on bread and cheese, more\nthan once left that wholesome meal to lean over the balusters and smell\nthe hot meats going into Mr. Sadler.\n\n\"You're spoiling him,\" he said to Mrs. Hatchard, after the new lodger had\nbeen there a week.  \"Mark my words--he'll get above himself.\"\n\n\"That's my look-out,\" said his wife briefly.  \"Don't come to me if you\nget into trouble, that's all,\" said the other.\n\nMrs. Hatchard laughed derisively.  \"You don't like him, that's what it\nis,\" she remarked.  \"He asked me yesterday whether he had offended you in\nany way.\"\n\n\"Oh!  He did, did he?\" snarled Mr. Hatchard.  \"Let him keep himself to\nhimself, and mind his own business.\"\n\n\"He said he thinks you have got a bad temper,\" continued his wife.  \"He\nthinks, perhaps, it's indigestion, caused by eating cheese for supper\nalways.\"\n\nMr. Hatchard affected not to hear, and, lighting his pipe, listened fer\nsome time to the hum of conversation between his wife and Mr. Sadler\nbelow.  With an expression of resignation on his face that was almost\nsaintly he knocked out his pipe at last and went to bed.\n\nHalf an hour passed, and he was still awake.  His wife's voice had\nceased, but the gruff tones of Mr. Sadler were still audible.  Then he\nsat up in bed and listened, as a faint cry of alarm and the sound of\nsomebody rushing upstairs fell on his ears.  The next moment the door of\nhis room burst open, and a wild figure, stumbling in the darkness, rushed\nover to the bed and clasped him in its arms.\n\n\"Help!\" gasped his wile's voice.  \"Oh, Alfred!  Alfred!\"\n\n\"Ma'am!\"  said Mr. Hatchard in a prim voice, as he struggled in vain to\nfree himself.\n\n\"I'm so--so--fr-frightened!\"  sobbed Mrs. Hatchard.\n\n\"That's no reason for coming into a lodger's room and throwing your arms\nround his neck,\" said her husband, severely.\n\n\"Don't be stu-stu-stupid,\" gasped Mrs. Hatchard.  \"He--he's sitting\ndownstairs in my room with a paper cap on his head and a fire-shovel in\nhis hand, and he--he says he's the--the Emperor of China.\"\n\n\"He?  Who?\" inquired her husband.\n\n\"Mr. Sad-Sadler,\" replied Mrs. Hatchard, almost strangling him.  \"He made\nme kneel in front o' him and keep touching the floor with my head.\"\n\nThe chair-bedstead shook in sympathy with Mr. Hatchard's husbandly\nemotion.\n\n\"Well, it's nothing to do with me,\" he said at last.\n\n\"He's mad,\" said his wife, in a tense whisper; \"stark staring mad.  He\nsays I'm his favorite wife, and he made me stroke his forehead.\"\n\nThe bed shook again.\n\n\"I don't see that I have any right to interfere,\" said Mr. Hatchard,\nafter he had quieted the bedstead.  \"He's your lodger.\"\n\n\"You're my husband,\" said Mrs. Hatchard.  \"Ho!\" said Mr. Hatchard.\n\"You've remembered that, have you?\"\n\n\"Yes, Alfred,\" said his wife.\n\n\"And are you sorry for all your bad behavior?\" demanded Mr. Hatchard.\n\nMrs. Hatchard hesitated.  Then a clatter of fire-irons downstairs moved\nher to speech.\n\n\"Ye-yes,\" she sobbed.\n\n\"And you want me to take you back?\"  queried the generous Mr. Hatchard.\n\n\"Ye-ye-yes,\" said his wife.\n\nMr. Hatchard got out of bed and striking a match lit the candle, and,\ntaking his overcoat from a peg behind the door, put it on and marched\ndownstairs.  Mrs. Hatchard, still trembling, followed behind.\n\n\"What's all this?\"  he demanded, throwing the door open with a flourish.\n\nMr. Sadler, still holding the fire-shovel sceptre-fashion and still with\nthe paper cap on his head, opened his mouth to reply.  Then, as he saw\nthe unkempt figure of Mr. Hatchard with the scared face of Mrs. Hatchard\npeeping over his shoulder, his face grew red, his eyes watered, and his\ncheeks swelled.\n\n\"K-K-K-Kch!  K-Kch!\" he said, explosively.  \"Talk English, not Chinese,\"\nsaid Mr. Hatchard, sternly.\n\nMr. Sadler threw down the fire-shovel, and to Mr. Hatchard's great\nannoyance, clapped his open hand over his mouth and rocked with\nmerriment.\n\n\"Sh--sh--she--she--\" he spluttered.\n\n\"That'll do,\" said Mr. Hatchard, hastily, with a warning frown.\n\n\"Kow-towed to me,\" gurgled Mr. Sadler.  \"You ought to have seen it, Alf.\nI shall never get over it--never.  It's--no--no good win-winking at me; I\ncan't help myself.\"\n\nHe put his handkerchief to his eyes and leaned back exhausted.  When he\nremoved it, he found himself alone and everything still but for a murmur\nof voices overhead.  Anon steps sounded on the stairs, and Mr. Hatchard,\ngrave of face, entered the room.\n\n\"Outside!\" he said, briefly.\n\n\"What!\" said the astounded Mr. Sadler.  \"Why, it's eleven o'clock.\"\n\n\"I can't help it if it's twelve o'clock,\" was the reply.  \"You shouldn't\nplay the fool and spoil things by laughing.  Now, are you going, or have\nI got to put you out?\"\n\nHe crossed the room and, putting his hand on the shoulder of the\nprotesting Mr. Sadler, pushed him into the passage, and taking his coat\nfrom the peg held it up for him.  Mr. Sadler, abandoning himself to his\nfate, got into it slowly and indulged in a few remarks on the subject of\ningratitude.\n\n\"I can't help it,\" said his friend, in a low voice.  \"I've had to swear\nI've never seen you before.\"\n\n\"Does she believe you?\" said the staring Mr. Sadler, shivering at the\nopen door.\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Hatchard, slowly, \"but she pre-tends to.\"",
