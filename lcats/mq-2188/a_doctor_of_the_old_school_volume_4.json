Was\nthere ever any doctor so self-forgetful and so utterly Christian as\nWilliam MacLure? To which I am proud to reply, on my conscience: Not one\nman, but many in Scotland and in the South country. I will dare prophecy\nalso across the sea.\n\nIt has been one man's good fortune to know four country doctors, not one\nof whom was without his faults--Weelum was not perfect--but who, each\none, might have sat for my hero. Three are now resting from their\nlabors, and the fourth, if he ever should see these lines, would never\nidentify himself.\n\nThen I desire to thank my readers, and chiefly the medical profession\nfor the reception given to the Doctor of Drumtochty.\n\nFor many years I have desired to pay some tribute to a class whose\nservice to the community was known to every countryman, but after the\ntale had gone forth my heart failed. For it might have been despised\nfor the little grace of letters in the style and because of the outward\nroughness of the man. But neither his biographer nor his circumstances\nhave been able to obscure MacLure who has himself won all honest hearts,\nand received afresh the recognition of his more distinguished brethren.\nFrom all parts of the English-speaking world letters have come in\ncommendation of Weelum MacLure, and many were from doctors who had\nreceived new courage. It is surely more honor than a new writer could\never have deserved to receive the approbation of a profession whose\ncharity puts us all to shame.\n\nMay I take this first opportunity to declare how deeply my heart has\nbeen touched by the favor shown to a simple book by the American people,\nand to express my hope that one day it may be given me to see you face\nto face.\n\nIAN MACLAREN. Liverpool, Oct. 4, 1895.\n\n\n\n\n\n                    THE DOCTOR'S LAST JOURNEY.\n\n\nIV\n\nTHE DOCTOR'S LAST JOURNEY\n\nDrumtochty had a vivid recollection of the winter when Dr. MacLure was\nlaid up for two months with a broken leg, and the Glen was dependent on\nthe dubious ministrations of the Kildrummie doctor. Mrs. Macfayden\nalso pretended to recall a \"whup\" of some kind or other he had in the\nfifties, but this was considered to be rather a pyrotechnic display of\nElspeth's superior memory than a serious statement of fact. MacLure\ncould not have ridden through the snow of forty winters without\nsuffering, yet no one ever heard him complain, and he never pled\nillness to any messenger by night or day.\n\n\"It took me,\" said Jamie Soutar to Milton afterwards, \"the feck o' ten\nmeenuts tae howk him 'an' Jess oot ae snawy nicht when Drums turned bad\nsudden, and if he didna try to excuse himself for no hearing me at aince\nwi' some story aboot juist comin' in frae Glen Urtach, and no bein' in\nhis bed for the laist twa nichts.\n\n\"He wes that carefu' o' himsel an' lazy that if it hedna been for the\nsiller, a've often thocht, Milton, he wud never hae dune a handstroke o'\nwark in the Glen.\n\n\"What scunnered me wes the wy the bairns were ta'en in wi' him. Man,\na've seen him tak a wee laddie on his knee that his ain mither cudna\nquiet, an' lilt 'Sing a song o' saxpence' till the bit mannie would be\nlauchin' like a gude are, an' pooin' the doctor's beard.\n\n\"As for the weemen, he fair cuist a glamour ower them; they're daein'\nnaethin' noo but speak aboot this body and the ither he cured, an' hoo\nhe aye hed a couthy word for sick fouk. Weemen hae nae discernment,\nMilton; tae hear them speak ye wud think MacLure hed been a releegious\nman like yersel, although, as ye said, he wes little mair than a Gallio.\n\n\"Bell Baxter was haverin' awa in the shop tae sic an extent aboot the wy\nMacLure brocht roond Saunders when he hed the fever that a' gied oot at\nthe door, a' wes that disgusted, an' a'm telt when Tammas Mitchell heard\nthe news in the smiddy he wes juist on the greeting.\n\n\"The smith said that he wes thinkin' o' Annie's tribble, but ony wy a'\nca' it rael bairnly. It's no like Drumtochty; ye're setting an example,\nMilton, wi' yir composure. But a' mind ye took the doctor's meesure as\nsune as ye cam intae the pairish.\"\n\nIt is the penalty of a cynic that he must have some relief for his\nsecret grief, and Milton began to weary of life in Jamie's hands\nduring those days.\n\nDrumtochty was not observant in the matter of health, but they had grown\nsensitive about Dr. MacLure, and remarked in the kirkyard all summer\nthat he was failing.\n\n\"He wes aye spare,\" said Hillocks, \"an' he's been sair twisted for the\nlaist twenty year, but a' never mind him booed till the year. An' he's\ngaein' intae sma' buke (bulk), an' a' dinna like that, neeburs.\n\n\"The Glen wudna dae weel withoot Weelum MacLure, an' he's no as young as\nhe wes. Man, Drumsheugh, ye micht wile him aff tae the saut water atween\nthe neeps and the hairst. He's been workin' forty year for a holiday,\nan' it's aboot due.\"\n\nDrumsheugh was full of tact, and met MacLure quite by accident on the\nroad.\n\n\"Saunders'll no need me till the shearing begins,\" he explained to the\ndoctor, \"an' a'm gaein' tae Brochty for a turn o' the hot baths; they're\nfine for the rheumatics.\n\n\"Wull ye no come wi' me for auld lang syne? it's lonesome for a solitary\nman, an' it wud dae ye gude.\"\n\n\"Na, na, Drumsheugh,\" said MacLure, who understood perfectly, \"a've dune\na' thae years withoot a break, an' a'm laith (unwilling) tae be takin'\nholidays at the tail end.\n\n\"A'll no be mony months wi' ye a' thegither noo, an' a'm wanting tae\nspend a' the time a' hev in the Glen. Ye see yersel that a'll sune be\ngetting ma lang rest, an' a'll no deny that a'm wearyin' for it.\"\n\nAs autumn passed into winter, the Glen noticed that the doctor's hair\nhad turned grey, and that his manner had lost all its roughness. A\nfeeling of secret gratitude filled their hearts, and they united in a\nconspiracy of attention. Annie Mitchell knitted a huge comforter in red\nand white, which the doctor wore in misery for one whole day, out of\nrespect for Annie, and then hung it in his sitting-room as a wall\nornament. Hillocks used to intercept him with hot drinks, and one\ndrifting day compelled him to shelter till the storm abated. Flora\nCampbell brought a wonderful compound of honey and whiskey, much tasted\nin Auchindarroch, for his cough, and the mother of young Burnbrae filled\nhis cupboard with black jam, as a healing measure. Jamie Soutar seemed\nto have an endless series of jobs in the doctor's direction, and looked\nin \"juist tae rest himsel\" in the kitchen.\n\nMacLure had been slowly taking in the situation, and at last he\nunburdened himself one night to Jamie.\n\n\"What ails the fouk, think ye? for they're aye lecturin' me noo tae\ntak care o' the weet and tae wrap masel up, an' there's no a week but\nthey're sendin' bit presents tae the house, till a'm fair ashamed.\"\n\n\"Oo, a'll explain that in a meenut,\" answered Jamie, \"for a' ken the\nGlen weel. Ye see they're juist try in' the Scripture plan o' heapin'\ncoals o' fire on yer head.\n\n\"Here ye've been negleckin' the fouk in seeckness an' lettin' them dee\nafore their  freends' eyes withoot a fecht, an' refusin' tae gang tae a\npuir wumman in her tribble, an' frichtenin' the bairns--no, a'm no\ndune--and scourgin' us wi' fees, and livin' yersel' on the fat o' the\nland.\n\n\"Ye've been carryin' on this trade ever sin yir father dee'd, and the\nGlen didna notis. But ma word, they've fund ye oot at laist, an' they're\ngaein' tae mak ye suffer for a' yir ill usage. Div ye understand noo?\"\nsaid Jamie, savagely.\n\nFor a while MacLure was silent, and then he only said:\n\n\"It's little a' did for the puir bodies; but ye hev a gude hert, Jamie,\na rael good hert.\"\n\nIt was a bitter December Sabbath, and the fathers were settling the\naffairs of the parish ankle deep in snow, when MacLure's old housekeeper\ntold Drumsheugh that the doctor was not able to rise, and wished to see\nhim in the afternoon. \"Ay, ay,\" said Hillocks, shaking his head, and\nthat day Drumsheugh omitted four pews with the ladle, while Jamie was so\nvicious on the way home that none could endure him.\n\nJanet had lit a fire in the unused grate, and hung a plaid by the window\nto break the power of the cruel north wind, but the bare room with its\nhalf-a-dozen bits of furniture and a worn strip of carpet, and the\noutlook upon the snow drifted up to the second pane of the window and\nthe black firs laden with their icy burden, sent a chill to Drumsheugh's\nheart.\n\nThe doctor had weakened sadly, and could hardly lift his head, but his\nface lit up at the sight of his visitor, and the big hand, which was now\nquite refined in its whiteness, came out from the bed-clothes with the\nold warm grip.\n\n\"Come in by, man, and sit doon; it's an  awfu' day tae bring ye sae far,\nbut a' kent ye wudna grudge the traivel.\n\n\"A' wesna sure till last nicht, an' then a' felt it wudna be lang, an'\na' took a wearyin' this mornin' tae see ye.\n\n\"We've been friends sin' we were laddies at the auld school in the firs,\nan' a' wud like ye tae be wi' me at the end. Ye 'ill stay the nicht,\nPaitrick, for auld lang syne.\"\n\nDrumsheugh was much shaken, and the sound of the Christian name, which\nhe had not heard since his mother's death, gave him a \"grue\" (shiver),\nas if one had spoken from the other world.\n\n\"It's maist awfu' tae hear ye speakin' aboot deein', Weelum; a' canna\nbear it. We 'ill hae the Muirtown doctor up, an' ye 'ill be aboot again\nin nae time.\n\n\"Ye hevna ony sair tribble; ye're juist trachled wi' hard wark an'\nneedin' a rest. Dinna say ye're gaein' tae leave us, Weelum; we canna\ndae withoot ye in Drumtochty;\" and Drumsheugh looked wistfully for some\nword of hope.\n\n\"Na, na, Paitrick, naethin' can be dune, an' it's ower late tae send for\nony doctor. There's a knock that canna be mista'en, an' a' heard it last\nnight. A've focht deith for ither fouk mair than forty year, but ma ain\ntime hes come at laist.\n\n\"A've nae tribble worth mentionin'--a bit titch o' bronchitis--an' a've\nhed a graund constitution; but a'm fair worn oot, Paitrick; that's ma\ncomplaint, an' its past curin'.\"\n\nDrumsheugh went over to the fireplace, and for a while did nothing but\nbreak up the smouldering peats, whose smoke powerfully affected his nose\nand eyes.\n\n\"When ye're ready, Paitrick, there's twa or three little trokes a' wud\nlike ye tae look aifter, an' a'll tell ye aboot them as lang's ma head's\nclear.\n\n\"A' didna keep buiks, as ye ken, for a' aye hed a guid memory, so\nnaebody 'ill be harried for money aifter ma deith, and ye 'ill hae nae\naccoonts tae collect.\n\n\"But the fouk are honest in Drumtochty, and they 'ill be offerin' ye\nsiller, an' a'll gie ye ma mind aboot it. Gin it be a puir body, tell\nher tae keep it and get a bit plaidie wi' the money, and she 'ill maybe\nthink o' her auld doctor at a time. Gin it be a bien (well-to-do) man,\ntak half of what he offers, for a Drumtochty man wud scorn to be mean in\nsic circumstances; and if onybody needs a doctor an' canna pay for him,\nsee he's no left tae dee when a'm oot o' the road.\"\n\n\"Nae fear o' that as lang as a'm livin', Weelum; that hundred's still\ntae the fore, ye ken, an' a'll tak care it's weel spent.\n\n\"Yon wes the best job we ever did thegither, an' dookin' Saunders, ye\n'ill no forget that nicht, Weelum\"--a gleam came into the doctor's\neyes--\"tae say neathin' o' the Highlan' fling.\"\n\nThe remembrance of that great victory came upon Drumsheugh, and tried\nhis fortitude.\n\n\"What 'ill become o's when ye're no here tae gie a hand in time o' need?\nwe 'ill tak ill wi' a stranger that disna ken ane o's frae anither.\"\n\n\"It's a' for the best, Paitrick, an' ye 'ill see that in a whilie. A've\nkent fine that ma day wes ower, an' that ye sud hae a younger man.\n\n\"A' did what a' cud tae keep up wi' the new medicine, but a' hed little\ntime for readin', an' nane for traivellin'.\n\n\"A'm the last o' the auld schule, an' a' ken as weel as onybody thet a'\nwesna sae dainty an' fine-mannered as the town doctors. Ye took me as a'\nwes, an' naebody ever cuist up tae me that a' wes a plain man. Na, na;\nye've been rael kind an' conseederate a' thae years.\"\n\n\"Weelum, gin ye cairry on sic nonsense ony langer,\" interrupted\nDrumsheugh, huskily, \"a'll leave the hoose; a' canna stand it.\"\n\n\"It's the truth, Paitrick, but we 'ill gae on wi' our wark, far a'm\nfailin' fast.\n\n\"Gie Janet ony sticks of furniture she needs tae furnish a hoose,\nand sell a' thing else tae pay the wricht (undertaker) an' bedrel\n(grave-digger). If the new doctor be a young laddie and no verra rich,\nye micht let him hae the buiks an' instruments; it 'ill aye be a help.\n\n\"But a' wudna like ye tae sell Jess, for she's been a faithfu' servant,\nan' a freend tae. There's a note or twa in that drawer a' savit, an'\nif ye kent ony man that wud gie her a bite o' grass and a sta' in his\nstable till she followed her maister--'\n\n\"Confoond ye, Weelum,\" broke out Drumsheugh; \"its doonricht cruel o' ye\nto speak like this tae me. Whar wud Jess gang but tae Drumsheugh? she\n'ill hae her run o' heck an' manger sae lang as she lives; the Glen\nwudna like tae see anither man on Jess, and nae man 'ill ever touch the\nauld mare.\"\n\n\"Dinna mind me, Paitrick, for a\" expeckit this; but ye ken we're no\nverra gleg wi' oor tongues in Drumtochty, an' dinna tell a' that's in\noor hearts.\n\n\"Weel, that's a' that a' mind, an' the rest a' leave tae yersel'. A've\nneither kith nor kin tae bury me, sae you an' the neeburs 'ill need tae\nlat me doon; but gin Tammas Mitchell or Saunders be stannin' near and\nlookin' as if they wud like a cord, gie't tae them, Paitrick. They're\nbaith dour chiels, and haena muckle tae say, but Tammas hes a graund\nhert, and there's waur fouk in the Glen than Saunders.\n\n\"A'm gettin' drowsy, an' a'll no be able tae follow ye sune, a' doot;\nwud ye read a bit tae me afore a' fa' ower?\n\n\"Ye 'ill find ma mither's Bible on the drawers' heid, but ye 'ill need\ntae come close tae the bed, for a'm no hearin' or seein' sae weel as a'\nwes when ye cam.\"\n\nDrumsheugh put on his spectacles and searched for a comfortable\nScripture, while the light of the lamp fell on his shaking hands and the\ndoctor's face where the shadow was now settling.\n\n\"Ma mither aye wantit this read tae her when she wes sober\" (weak), and\nDrumsheugh began, \"In My Father's house are many mansions,\" but MacLure\nstopped him.\n\n\"It's a bonnie word, an' yir mither wes a sanct; but it's no for the\nlike o' me. It's ower gude; a' daurna tak it.\n\n\"Shut the buik an' let it open itsel, an' ye 'ill get a bit a've been\nreadin' every nicht the laist month.\"\n\nThen Drumsheugh found the Parable wherein the Master tells us what God\nthinks of a Pharisee and of a penitent sinner, till he came to the\nwords: \"And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so\nmuch as his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be\nmerciful to me a sinner.\"\n\n\"That micht hae been written for me, Paitrick, or ony ither auld sinner\nthat hes feenished his life, an' hes naethin' tae say for himsel'.\n\n\"It wesna easy for me tae get tae kirk, but a' cud hae managed wi' a\nstretch, an' a' used langidge a' sudna, an' a' micht hae been gentler,\nand not been so short in the temper. A' see't a' noo.\n\n\"It's ower late tae mend, but ye 'ill maybe juist say to the fouk that I\nwes sorry, an' a'm houpin' that the Almichty 'ill hae mercy on me.\n\n\"Cud ye ... pit up a bit prayer, Paitrick?\"\n\n\"A' haena the words,\" said Drumsheugh in great distress; \"wud ye like's\ntae send for the minister?\"\n\n\"It's no the time for that noo, an' a' wud rather hae yersel'--juist\nwhat's in yir heart, Paitrick: the Almichty 'ill ken the lave (rest)\nHimsel'.\"\n\nSo Drumsheugh knelt and prayed with many pauses.\n\n\"Almichty God ... dinna be hard on Weelum MacLure, for he's no been hard\nwi' onybody in Drumtochty.... Be kind tae him as he's been tae us a' for\nforty year.... We're a' sinners afore Thee.... Forgive him what he's\ndune wrang, an' dinna cuist it up tae him.... Mind the fouk he's helpit\n.... the wee-men an' bairnies.... an' gie him a welcome hame, for he's\nsair needin't after a' his wark.... Amen.\"\n\n\"Thank ye, Paitrick, and gude nicht tae ye. Ma ain true freend, gie's\nyir hand, for a'll maybe no ken ye again.\n\n\"Noo a'll say ma mither's prayer and hae a sleep, but ye 'ill no leave\nme till a' is ower.\"\n\nThen he repeated as he had done every night of his life:\n\n  \"This night I lay me down to sleep,\n  I pray the Lord my soul to keep.\n  And if I die before I wake,\n  I pray the Lord my soul to take.\"\n\nHe was sleeping quietly when the wind drove the snow against the window\nwith a sudden \"swish;\" and he instantly awoke, so to say, in his sleep.\nSome one needed him.\n\n\"Are ye frae Glen Urtach?\" and an unheard voice seemed to have answered\nhim.\n\n\"Worse is she, an' suffering awfu'; that's no lichtsome; ye did richt\ntae come.\n\n\"The front door's drifted up; gang roond tae the back, an' ye 'ill get\nintae the kitchen; a'll be ready in a meenut.\n\n\"Gie's a hand wi' the lantern when a'm saidling Jess, an' ye needna come\non till daylicht; a' ken the road.\"\n\nThen he was away in his sleep on some errand of mercy, and struggling\nthrough the storm. \"It's a coorse nicht, Jess, an' heavy traivellin';\ncan ye see afore ye, lass? for a'm clean confused wi' the snaw; bide a\nwee till a' find the diveesion o' the roads; it's aboot here back or\nforrit.\n\n\"Steady, lass, steady, dinna plunge; i'ts a drift we're in, but ye're no\nsinkin'; ... up noo; ... there ye are on the road again.\n\n\"Eh, it's deep the nicht, an' hard on us baith, but there's a puir\nwumman micht dee if we didna warstle through; ... that's it; ye ken fine\nwhat a'm sayin.'\n\n\"We 'ill hae tae leave the road here, an' tak tae the muir. Sandie 'ill\nno can leave the wife alane tae meet us; ... feel for yersel\" lass, and\nkeep oot o' the holes.\n\n\"Yon's the hoose black in the snaw. Sandie! man, ye frichtened us; a'\ndidna see ye ahint the dyke; hoos the wife?\"\n\nAfter a while he began again:\n\n\"Ye're fair dune, Jess, and so a' am masel'; we're baith gettin' auld,\nan' dinna tak sae weel wi' the nicht wark.\n\n\"We 'ill sune be hame noo; this is the black wood, and it's no lang\naifter that; we're ready for oor beds, Jess.... ay, ye like a clap at a\ntime; mony a mile we've gaed hegither.\n\n\"Yon's the licht in the kitchen window; nae wonder ye're nickering\n(neighing).... it's been a stiff journey; a'm tired, lass.... a'm tired\ntae deith,\" and the voice died into silence.\n\nDrumsheugh held his friend's hand, which now and again tightened in his,\nand as he watched, a change came over the face on the pillow beside him.\nThe lines of weariness disappeared, as if God's hand had passed over it;\nand peace began to gather round the closed eyes.\n\nThe doctor has forgotten the toil of later years, and has gone back to\nhis boyhood.\n\n\"The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want,\"  he repeated, till he came to\nthe last verse, and then he hesitated.\n\n  \"Goodness and mercy all my life\n  Shall surely follow me.\n\n\"Follow me ... and ... and ... what's next? Mither said I wes tae haed\nready when she cam.\n\n\"'A'll come afore ye gang tae sleep, Wullie, but ye 'ill no get yir kiss\nunless ye can feenish the psalm.'\n\n\"And ... in God's house ... for evermore my ... hoo dis it rin? a canna\nmind the next word ... my, my--\n\n\"It's ower dark noo tae read it, an' mither 'ill sune be comin.\"\n\nDrumsheugh, in an agony, whispered into his ear, \"'My dwelling-place,'\nWeelum.\"\n\n\"That's it, that's it a' noo; wha said it?\n\n  \"And in God's house for evermore\n  My dwelling-place shall be.\n\n\"A'm ready noo, an' a'll get ma kiss when mither comes; a' wish she wud\ncome, for a'm tired an' wantin' tae sleep.\n\n\"Yon's her step ... an' she's carryin' a licht in her hand; a' see it\nthrough the door.\n\n\"Mither! a' kent ye wudna forget yir laddie for ye promised tae come,\nand a've feenished ma psalm.\n\n  \"And in God's house for evermore\n  My dwelling-place shall be.\n\n\"Gie me the kiss, mither, for a've been waitin' for ye, an' a'll sune be\nasleep.\"\n\nThe grey morning light fell on Drumsheugh, still holding his friend's\ncold hand, and staring at a hearth where the fire had died down into\nwhite ashes; but the peace on the doctor's face was of one who rested\nfrom his labours.",
