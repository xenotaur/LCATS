(_Goes up and peeps, comes back holding\n  hand to heart._) It\u2019s put me in a fright.\n    Mona! you silly goose! This palpitation\n  Is strange perhaps, but not a bad sensation.\n  I rather like it. Is it fear? No question!\n  I\u2019m not afraid! Perhaps it\u2019s indigestion?\n  I\u2019ll take another peep.\n\n  (_Goes to PRINCE on tip_toe, and comes away rapidly, clapping her\n     hands._)\n\n                        He\u2019s charming, really!\n  If I could take him home I\u2019d like to dearly.\n  How nice he\u2019d be to play with!

This is the Norway coast, and I\u2019m its daughter.\n  Young sir, you\u2019re wet! your coat\u2014\u2014\n                               Might be a better \u2019un.\n  I\u2019m _young_; but still you won\u2019t find here a _wetter_ \u2019un.\n\n    MONA. Tell me your tale, for stories I love well.\n\n    PRINCE DOODLE. Story; why bless you! I have none to tell;\n  Only last night, a-sailing on the ocean,\n  There came a squall, at least so I\u2019ve a notion.\n  It stormed! it blew! it rained! the lightning crashed!\n  We pitched and rolled, (_imitates motion of ship_) and tossed, the\n     thunder flashed;\n  The wind, it rose and howled, and so did we.\n\n    MONA. That\u2019s very queer!\n\n    PRINCE DOODLE.           Things often are at sea.\n  \u201cCut down the starboard stays\u2019l!\u201d cried I. Then\n  \u201cSplice the jib-boom, there, to the cross-trees, men!\u201d\n\n  (_Speaks excitedly, suiting action to words, and using hands as\n     speaking trumpet_,)\n\n  \u201cStand by to hoist the to\u2019gallant sheet anchor!\n  Take a pull on the weather lee scuppers, my hearties!\n  Let the mizzen binnacle go with a run!\u201d\n\n    MONA. (_Clapping her hands with delight._)\n  I like to hear you talk. Go on! What fun!\n\n    PRINCE DOODLE. (_Disgusted at interruption._)\n  That\u2019s all.\n\n    MONA. (_Disappointed._) That\u2019s not the end?\n\n    PRINCE DOODLE.            \u2019Twon\u2019t take a minuit.\n  The ship she gave a lurch; and\u2014left us in it.\n  Then to a hen coop clung the crew of forty-five;\n\n    MONA. They\u2019re drowned? (_clasping her hands in horror._)\n\n    PRINCE DOODLE. Oh, not at all; they\u2019re all alive.\n  They flew away.\n\n    MONA.                             What, men!\n\n    PRINCE DOODLE.             No; geese, my dear!\n  I\u2019m rather mixed. Perhaps my head is queer.\n  Listen, and I\u2019ll a tale unfold to harrow\u2014\u2014\n\n    MONA. (_Shrinking back_)\n  Ah! Don\u2019t!\n\n    PRINCE DOODLE.           A tale to fr-r-r-r-eeze\u2014\u2014\n\n    MONA.                              Oh, dear!\n\n    PRINCE DOODLE.                       Your marrow!\n\n    PRINCE DOODLE. (_Loud chord, and tremulo music through the\n       following._)\n  I have an uncle!\n\n    MONA.          Not uncommon, surely.\n\n    PRINCE DOODLE. Some years ago, my poor papa, felt poorly;\n  Took to his bed, and\u2014died\u2014they say most queerly.\n  My uncle deals in magic? See you?\n\n    MONA.                          Clearly!\n\n    PRINCE DOODLE. My parent gone, th\u2019 apparent heir was I!\n  To gain the throne he wished that I should die.\n  And then, because I couldn\u2019t see why he,\n  Instead of I, the nation\u2019s king should be;\n  He shipped me off, alone, to go to _see_,\n  Alone I said! not so! off was I cast\n  With four and forty geese before the mast!\n  His parting words were these:\u2014\u201cReturn, my dear,\n  (Of course the whole thing was a jibe and sneer)\n  When\u2019ere a mermaid\u2019s heart you hold in hand,\n  And four and forty men before me stand,\n  In place of all these geese I send as crew.\n  \u2019Till then\u2014\u2018O reservoir!\u2019 my boy! adieu!\u201d\n\n    MONA. Oh! what a dreadful man!\n\n    PRINCE DOODLE.       He seized my brother;\n  And swore we ne\u2019er again should see each other\n  Until this mermaid I should meet, so kind,\n  And then a mountain full of diamonds find.\n  The thing is absurd! There are no mermaids here,\n  My uncle has the thro_wn_; I\u2019m _pitched out_ clear!\n\n    MONA. The diamond mountain of the Gnome King, see\n\n                                                       (_Points off L._)\n\n  It\u2019s full of diamonds: full as full can be.\n\n    PRINCE DOODLE. What\u2019s that you say? That mountain! It\u2019s all rock.\n  Diamonds inside!  Oh, come! you only mock!\n  I\u2019d like to see my brother\u2014\n\n    MONA.                            What\u2019s your name?\n\n    PRINCE DOODLE. Oh! I\u2019m a Prince, Prince Doodle.\n\n    MONA.                       What a shame!\n\n    PRINCE DOODLE. My kingdom\u2019s in Cockagne, you must have heard\n  Of Cock-a-doodle-do. (_She shakes head._) That noble bird\n  Was a remote progenitor. Indeed,\n  Our pedigree, by Darwin, you can read.\n\n    MONA. I never learnt to read. Stay! (_puts fingers to forehead_) on\n       me dawns,\n  A notion (_triumphantly_) that\u2019s where people live \u201c_en Prince?_\u201d\n     (_pronounce \u201con prawns.\u201d_)\n\n    PRINCE DOODLE. (_Aside._) _A notion_ fishy! (_Aloud._) No, my dear,\n       on _shrimps_!\n  Your friends?\u2014They\u2019re?\u2014\u2014\n\n    MONA.                  Mermaids.\n\n    PRINCE DOODLE.               _water-\u201cnimps?\u201d_\n  Why _w(h)at a\u2014(looks towards her feet) tail_?\n                                Forgive the observation,\n  Is there not something queer in your formation?\n  (_Hesitatingly._) You don\u2019t wear boots and shoes? (_aside_)\n                                Ah, that a fix is!\n  They _can\u2019t_ of course!\n\n    MONA.             Why not? My number\u2019s \u201csixes.\u201d\n  You never heard of _soles_ and _eels_?\n\n    PRINCE DOODLE.                Yes, fried!\n\n    MONA. Around our grottoes, there(_\u2019s_) _sea-horses_(_\u2019s_) _hide_.\n  For _bark_\u2014\u2014you\u2019ve heard the \u201cmoaning of the _tied_,\u201d\n  And _hide_ and _bark_ make leather, eh?\n\n    PRINCE DOODLE.                           Of course!\n  (_Aside._) I\u2019ve traced my _night mare_ up to its _sea-horse_;\n  A mermaid! Here\u2019s my chance! (_Aloud._) Dear me! How stupid!\n  (_Aside._) Now aid me, Venus!\n\n    MONA. (_Overheating aside._) Venus! He must be Cupid!\n  Why how the boy has grown! (_Aloud._) Is she your \u201cMa?\u201d\n\n    PRINCE DOODLE. Alas, sweet maid! I am an orphan! (_sighs_) Ah!\n  With ne\u2019er a _parent_, we\u2019re a _pair rent_, too.\n\n    MONA. You have my sympathy, what can I do!\n\n                                       (_Aside, holding hand to heart._)\n\n  Dear me! That queer sensation\u2019s come again!\n\n    PRINCE DOODLE.    Your sympathy, _see, mends_ an orphan\u2019s _pain_,\n  My _loving, lass_!\n\n    MONA.                Your _glass_, I\u2019d mend, Prince, but I\n  Regret I\u2019ve neither got _cements_ nor putty.\n\n    PRINCE DOODLE. Say, could you learn to love?\n\n    MONA. (_Innocently._) You\u2019ll teach me your way?\n\n    PRINCE DOODLE. It\u2019s plain! No doubt it\u2019s much the same in Norway.\n\n  (_He puts arm round her waist and is going to kiss her, when he looks\n     off L._)\n\n  See! yonder comes a _N\u2019orse-man_ on an _\u2019orse_!\n\n    MONA. Oh! Let us fly! The Gnome King!\n\n    PRINCE DOODLE.                       Fly! Of course.\n  If you\u2019ll fly with me, dear, we\u2019ll never part.\n\n    MONA. (_Aside._) I\u2019ve just discovered that I\u2019ve got\u2014a heart!\n\n  (_Exeunt through opening at back R. U. E. Enter L. 2 E.

Produce your budget, quick!\n  Bring lights! Pray what\u2019s the price of candles, _stick_?\n\n  (_ROOSTER aside._) There\u2019s not a candle left.

KING. Well, how\u2019s the Exchequer?\n\n    ROOS.          Empty.\n\n    G. KING.                        Stock it.\n\n    ROOS. I\u2019ve eighteen pence, sir, in my waistcoat pocket.\n  It\u2019s pretty clear we must increase taxation.\n\n    G. K. We\u2019ll tax the gnomes of each denomination.\n\n    ROOS. They\u2019re taxed already, sir, wholesale and retail.\n\n    G. K. Tax them some more.\n\n    ROOS.         But how?\n\n    G. K.                          Well, that\u2019s a detail.\n  Taxes. Tax every thing and every body,\n  Toffee and tubs, ice cream and whiskey toddy.\n  Tax folks who fish\u2014for compliments or salmon.\n  Lay taxes on their corns for shooting.\n\n    ROOS.                          (_aside_) Gammon.\n  You\u2019re pleased to joke. The situation\u2019s grave.\n\n    G. K. And so am I. I\u2019m quite in earnest, slave.\n  Then, tax the air they breathe, the _airs_ they hear,\n  And tax their wives, it\u2019s right _they_ should be _dear_.\n  Tax all pet oysters, sprats and whales they\u2019re keeping.\n  Tax \u2019em for eating, drinking, also sleeping.\n  Tax them besides for laughing, singing, crying.\n  And lay a heavy tax on folks for _dye_ing.\n  Put taxes on the nation\u2019s food and fuel,\n  From turtle soup, to grits for babies\u2019 gruel.\n  Stay, here I have it! why, of course, you gabies\n  You\u2019d make a fortune by a tax on babies.\n\n    GENERAL BOUNCE.

Well, how\u2019s the army? can we cut it down?\n  Make sixpence go as far as half a crown?\n\n    G. BOUNCE. One General, (_points to self_,) and one Captain of the\n       forces.\n\n                                           (_Points to CAPTAIN POUNCE._)\n\n  An inefficient staff, sir, that of course is;\n  Of cavalry we\u2019ve none.\n\n    G.

(_C. leaning on gun._)\n  I must confess. I think it\u2019s rather hard.\n  For sixteen weeks I\u2019ve been here, mounting guard.\n  I\u2019ve eaten nothing but a rind of cheese,\n  And that wont help a man to \u201cstand at ease.\u201d\n  I never get to mess, but into _messes_,\n  The General\u2019s joint is when the l_o_in_e_ he dresses.\n  That\u2019s not the worst; it\u2019s more than I can bear,\n  To hear the little beggar cry \u201cform square!\u201d\n  One into four, won\u2019t go.

A little tiny boy, so high.\n\n    MONA.                            A change!\n\n    NOO.

I\u2019ve heard a tale.\n  Like yours before. It\u2019s very like a whale.\n\n    NOO. My tail! there\u2019s more behind. He then seized _me_\n  And shipped me off, a little boy, to sea.\n  For many years I\u2019ve wandered as a sailor,\n  And earned my salt as cook on board a whaler.\n  Shipwrecked upon this most unkindly shore,\n  I\u2019ve lived a wretched life ten years or more.\n  The manikins who live down there below,\n  Took me, and made me giant in a show:\n  \u201cWalk up! walk up! just going to begin.\u201d\n\n                                                   (_imitates Showman._)\n\n  That\u2019s what they used to say to bring folks in\u2014\n  \u201cThis giant is all real, no sawdust here!\u201d\n\n    MONA.

Oh, that was cruel.\n\n    NOO. And if I would\u2019t act they\u2019d stop my gruel.\n  Well, now I\u2019ve joined the army, serve the nation.\n  That means long drills, stiff collars and starvation.\n  I\u2019ll make a raft or boat, and get away,\n  So sure as my name\u2019s Noodle, miss, some day.\n\n    MONA. What name?\n\n    NOO.             Why, Noodle.\n\n    MONA.                         Noodle?\n\n    NOO.                            Why not Noodle?\n\n    MONA.
