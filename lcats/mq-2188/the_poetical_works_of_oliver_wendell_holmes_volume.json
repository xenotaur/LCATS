Ars Poetica.\n     Ab lis qua non adjuvant quam mollissime oportet pedem referre.--\n     Quintillian, L. VI. C. 4.\n\n\nThese verses have always been printed in my collected poems, and as the\nbest of them may bear a single reading, I allow them to appear, but in a\nless conspicuous position than the other productions.  A chick, before\nhis shell is off his back, is hardly a fair subject for severe criticism.\nIf one has written anything worth preserving, his first efforts may be\nobjects of interest and curiosity.  Other young authors may take\nencouragement from seeing how tame, how feeble, how commonplace were the\nrudimentary attempts of the half-fledged poet. If the boy or youth had\nanything in him, there will probably be some sign of it in the midst of\nhis imitative mediocrities and ambitious failures.  These \"first verses\"\nof mine, written before I was sixteen, have little beyond a common\nacademy boy's ordinary performance.  Yet a kindly critic said there was\none line which showed a poetical quality:--\n\n                 \"The boiling ocean trembled into calm.\"\n\nOne of these poems--the reader may guess which--won fair words from\nThackeray. The Spectre Pig was a wicked suggestion which came into my\nhead after reading Dana's Buccaneer. Nobody seemed to find it out, and\nI never mentioned it to the venerable poet, who might not have been\npleased with the parody.  This is enough to say of these unvalued copies\nof verses.\n\n\n                               FIRST VERSES\n\n              PHILLIPS ACADEMY, ANDOVER, MASS., 1824 OR 1825\n\n\nTRANSLATION FROM THE ENEID, BOOK I.\n\nTHE god looked out upon the troubled deep\nWaked into tumult from its placid sleep;\nThe flame of anger kindles in his eye\nAs the wild waves ascend the lowering sky;\nHe lifts his head above their awful height\nAnd to the distant fleet directs his sight,\nNow borne aloft upon the billow's crest,\nStruck by the bolt or by the winds oppressed,\nAnd well he knew that Juno's vengeful ire\nFrowned from those clouds and sparkled in that fire.\nOn rapid pinions as they whistled by\nHe calls swift Zephyrus and Eurus nigh\nIs this your glory in a noble line\nTo leave your confines and to ravage mine?\nWhom I--but let these troubled waves subside--\nAnother tempest and I'll quell your pride!\nGo--bear our message to your master's ear,\nThat wide as ocean I am despot here;\nLet him sit monarch in his barren caves,\nI wield the trident and control the waves\nHe said, and as the gathered vapors break\nThe swelling ocean seemed a peaceful lake;\nTo lift their ships the graceful nymphs essayed\nAnd the strong trident lent its powerful aid;\nThe dangerous banks are sunk beneath the main,\nAnd the light chariot skims the unruffled plain.\nAs when sedition fires the public mind,\nAnd maddening fury leads the rabble blind,\nThe blazing torch lights up the dread alarm,\nRage points the steel and fury nerves the arm,\nThen, if some reverend Sage appear in sight,\nThey stand--they gaze, and check their headlong flight,--\nHe turns the current of each wandering breast\nAnd hushes every passion into rest,--\nThus by the power of his imperial arm\nThe boiling ocean trembled into calm;\nWith flowing reins the father sped his way\nAnd smiled serene upon rekindled day.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MEETING OF THE DRYADS\n\nWritten after a general pruning of the trees around Harvard College.\nA little poem, on a similar occasion, may be found in the works of Swift,\nfrom which, perhaps, the idea was borrowed; although I was as much\nsurprised as amused to meet with it some time after writing the following\nlines.\n\nIT was not many centuries since,\nWhen, gathered on the moonlit green,\nBeneath the Tree of Liberty,\nA ring of weeping sprites was seen.\n\nThe freshman's lamp had long been dim,\nThe voice of busy day was mute,\nAnd tortured Melody had ceased\nHer sufferings on the evening flute.\n\nThey met not as they once had met,\nTo laugh o'er many a jocund tale\nBut every pulse was beating low,\nAnd every cheek was cold and pale.\n\nThere rose a fair but faded one,\nWho oft had cheered them with her song;\nShe waved a mutilated arm,\nAnd silence held the listening throng.\n\n\"Sweet friends,\" the gentle nymph began,\n\"From opening bud to withering leaf,\nOne common lot has bound us all,\nIn every change of joy and grief.\n\n\"While all around has felt decay,\nWe rose in ever-living prime,\nWith broader shade and fresher green,\nBeneath the crumbling step of Time.\n\n\"When often by our feet has past\nSome biped, Nature's walking whim,\nSay, have we trimmed one awkward shape,\nOr lopped away one crooked limb?\n\n\"Go on, fair Science; soon to thee\nShall. Nature yield her idle boast;\nHer vulgar fingers formed a tree,\nBut thou halt trained it to a post.\n\n\"Go, paint the birch's silver rind,\nAnd quilt the peach with softer down;\nUp with the willow's trailing threads,\nOff with the sunflower's radiant crown!\n\n\"Go, plant the lily on the shore,\nAnd set the rose among the waves,\nAnd bid the tropic bud unbind\nIts silken zone in arctic caves;\n\n\"Bring bellows for the panting winds,\nHang up a lantern by the moon,\nAnd give the nightingale a fife,\nAnd lend the eagle a balloon!\n\n\"I cannot smile,--the tide of scorn,\nThat rolled through every bleeding vein,\nComes kindling fiercer as it flows\nBack to its burning source again.\n\n\"Again in every quivering leaf\nThat moment's agony I feel,\nWhen limbs, that spurned the northern blast,\nShrunk from the sacrilegious steel.\n\n\"A curse upon the wretch who dared\nTo crop us with his felon saw!\nMay every fruit his lip shall taste\nLie like a bullet in his maw.\n\n\"In every julep that he drinks,\nMay gout, and bile, and headache be;\nAnd when he strives to calm his pain,\nMay colic mingle with his tea.\n\n\"May nightshade cluster round his path,\nAnd thistles shoot, and brambles cling;\nMay blistering ivy scorch his veins,\nAnd dogwood burn, and nettles sting.\n\n\"On him may never shadow fall,\nWhen fever racks his throbbing brow,\nAnd his last shilling buy a rope\nTo hang him on my highest bough!\"\n\nShe spoke;--the morning's herald beam\nSprang from the bosom of the sea,\nAnd every mangled sprite returned\nIn sadness to her wounded tree.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR\n\nTHERE was a sound of hurrying feet,\nA tramp on echoing stairs,\nThere was a rush along the aisles,--\nIt was the hour of prayers.\n\nAnd on, like Ocean's midnight wave,\nThe current rolled along,\nWhen, suddenly, a stranger form\nWas seen amidst the throng.\n\nHe was a dark and swarthy man,\nThat uninvited guest;\nA faded coat of bottle-green\nWas buttoned round his breast.\n\nThere was not one among them all\nCould say from whence he came;\nNor beardless boy, nor ancient man,\nCould tell that stranger's name.\n\nAll silent as the sheeted dead,\nIn spite of sneer and frown,\nFast by a gray-haired senior's side\nHe sat him boldly down.\n\nThere was a look of horror flashed\nFrom out the tutor's eyes;\nWhen all around him rose to pray,\nThe stranger did not rise!\n\nA murmur broke along the crowd,\nThe prayer was at an end;\nWith ringing heels and measured tread,\nA hundred forms descend.\n\nThrough sounding aisle, o'er grating stair,\nThe long procession poured,\nTill all were gathered on the seats\nAround the Commons board.\n\nThat fearful stranger! down he sat,\nUnasked, yet undismayed;\nAnd on his lip a rising smile\nOf scorn or pleasure played.\n\nHe took his hat and hung it up,\nWith slow but earnest air;\nHe stripped his coat from off his back,\nAnd placed it on a chair.\n\nThen from his nearest neighbor's side\nA knife and plate he drew;\nAnd, reaching out his hand again,\nHe took his teacup too.\n\nHow fled the sugar from the bowl\nHow sunk the azure cream!\nThey vanished like the shapes that float\nUpon a summer's dream.\n\nA long, long draught,--an outstretched hand,--\nAnd crackers, toast, and tea,\nThey faded from the stranger's touch,\nLike dew upon the sea.\n\nThen clouds were dark on many a brow,\nFear sat upon their souls,\nAnd, in a bitter agony,\nThey clasped their buttered rolls.\n\nA whisper trembled through the crowd,\nWho could the stranger be?\nAnd some were silent, for they thought\nA cannibal was he.\n\nWhat if the creature should arise,--\nFor he was stout and tall,--\nAnd swallow down a sophomore,\nCoat, crow's-foot, cap, and all!\n\nAll sullenly the stranger rose;\nThey sat in mute despair;\nHe took his hat from off the peg,\nHis coat from off the chair.\n\nFour freshmen fainted on the seat,\nSix swooned upon the floor;\nYet on the fearful being passed,\nAnd shut the chapel door.\n\nThere is full many a starving man,\nThat walks in bottle green,\nBut never more that hungry one\nIn Commons hall was seen.\n\nYet often at the sunset hour,\nWhen tolls the evening bell,\nThe freshman lingers on the steps,\nThat frightful tale to tell.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TOADSTOOL\n\nTHERE 's a thing that grows by the fainting flower,\nAnd springs in the shade of the lady's bower;\nThe lily shrinks, and the rose turns pale,\nWhen they feel its breath in the summer gale,\nAnd the tulip curls its leaves in pride,\nAnd the blue-eyed violet starts aside;\nBut the lily may flaunt, and the tulip stare,\nFor what does the honest toadstool care?\nShe does not glow in a painted vest,\nAnd she never blooms on the maiden's breast;\nBut she comes, as the saintly sisters do,\nIn a modest suit of a Quaker hue.\nAnd, when the stars in the evening skies\nAre weeping dew from their gentle eyes,\nThe toad comes out from his hermit cell,\nThe tale of his faithful love to tell.\n\nOh, there is light in her lover's glance,\nThat flies to her heart like a silver lance;\nHis breeches are made of spotted skin,\nHis jacket 'is tight, and his pumps are thin;\nIn a cloudless night you may hear his song,\nAs its pensive melody floats along,\nAnd, if you will look by the moonlight fair,\nThe trembling form of the toad is there.\n\nAnd he twines his arms round her slender stem,\nIn the shade of her velvet diadem;\nBut she turns away in her maiden shame,\nAnd will not breathe on the kindling flame;\nHe sings at her feet through the live-long night,\nAnd creeps to his cave at the break of light;\nAnd whenever he comes to the air above,\nHis throat is swelling with baffled love.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SPECTRE PIG\n\nA BALLAD\n\nIT was the stalwart butcher man,\nThat knit his swarthy brow,\nAnd said the gentle Pig must die,\nAnd sealed it with a vow.\n\nAnd oh! it was the gentle Pig\nLay stretched upon the ground,\nAnd ah! it was the cruel knife\nHis little heart that found.\n\nThey took him then, those wicked men,\nThey trailed him all along;\nThey put a stick between his lips,\nAnd through his heels a thong;\n\nAnd round and round an oaken beam\nA hempen cord they flung,\nAnd, like a mighty pendulum,\nAll solemnly he swung!\n\nNow say thy prayers, thou sinful man,\nAnd think what thou hast done,\nAnd read thy catechism well,\nThou bloody-minded one;\n\nFor if his sprite should walk by night,\nIt better were for thee,\nThat thou wert mouldering in the ground,\nOr bleaching in the sea.\n\nIt was the savage butcher then,\nThat made a mock of sin,\nAnd swore a very wicked oath,\nHe did not care a pin.\n\nIt was the butcher's youngest son,--\nHis voice was broke with sighs,\nAnd with his pocket-handkerchief\nHe wiped his little eyes;\n\nAll young and ignorant was he,\nBut innocent and mild,\nAnd, in his soft simplicity,\nOut spoke the tender child:--\n\n\"Oh, father, father, list to me;\nThe Pig is deadly sick,\nAnd men have hung him by his heels,\nAnd fed him with a stick.\"\n\nIt was the bloody butcher then,\nThat laughed as he would die,\nYet did he soothe the sorrowing child,\nAnd bid him not to cry;--\n\n\"Oh, Nathan, Nathan, what's a Pig,\nThat thou shouldst weep and wail?\nCome, bear thee like a butcher's child,\nAnd thou shalt have his tail!\"\n\nIt was the butcher's daughter then,\nSo slender and so fair,\nThat sobbed as it her heart would break,\nAnd tore her yellow hair;\n\nAnd thus she spoke in thrilling tone,--\nFast fell the tear-drops big:--\n\"Ah! woe is me! Alas! Alas!\nThe Pig! The Pig! The Pig!\"\n\nThen did her wicked father's lips\nMake merry with her woe,\nAnd call her many a naughty name,\nBecause she whimpered so.\n\nYe need not weep, ye gentle ones,\nIn vain your tears are shed,\nYe cannot wash his crimson hand,\nYe cannot soothe the dead.\n\nThe bright sun folded on his breast\nHis robes of rosy flame,\nAnd softly over all the west\nThe shades of evening came.\n\nHe slept, and troops of murdered Pigs\nWere busy with his dreams;\nLoud rang their wild, unearthly shrieks,\nWide yawned their mortal seams.\n\nThe clock struck twelve; the Dead hath heard;\nHe opened both his eyes,\nAnd sullenly he shook his tail\nTo lash the feeding flies.\n\nOne quiver of the hempen cord,--\nOne struggle and one bound,--\nWith stiffened limb and leaden eye,\nThe Pig was on the ground.\n\nAnd straight towards the sleeper's house\nHis fearful way he wended;\nAnd hooting owl and hovering bat\nOn midnight wing attended.\n\nBack flew the bolt, up rose the latch,\nAnd open swung the door,\nAnd little mincing feet were heard\nPat, pat along the floor.\n\nTwo hoofs upon the sanded floor,\nAnd two upon the bed;\nAnd they are breathing side by side,\nThe living and the dead!\n\n\"Now wake, now wake, thou butcher man!\nWhat makes thy cheek so pale?\nTake hold! take hold! thou dost not fear\nTo clasp a spectre's tail?\"\n\nUntwisted every winding coil;\nThe shuddering wretch took hold,\nAll like an icicle it seemed,\nSo tapering and so cold.\n\n\"Thou com'st with me, thou butcher man!\"--\nHe strives to loose his grasp,\nBut, faster than the clinging vine,\nThose twining spirals clasp;\n\nAnd open, open swung the door,\nAnd, fleeter than the wind,\nThe shadowy spectre swept before,\nThe butcher trailed behind.\n\nFast fled the darkness of the night,\nAnd morn rose faint and dim;\nThey called full loud, they knocked full long,\nThey did not waken him.\n\nStraight, straight towards that oaken beam,\nA trampled pathway ran;\nA ghastly shape was swinging there,--\nIt was the butcher man.\n\n\n\n\nTO A CAGED LION\n\nPoor conquered monarch! though that haughty glance\nStill speaks thy courage unsubdued by time,\nAnd in the grandeur of thy sullen tread\nLives the proud spirit of thy burning clime;--\nFettered by things that shudder at thy roar,\nTorn from thy pathless wilds to pace this narrow floor!\n\nThou wast the victor, and all nature shrunk\nBefore the thunders of thine awful wrath;\nThe steel-armed hunter viewed thee from afar,\nFearless and trackless in thy lonely path!\nThe famished tiger closed his flaming eye,\nAnd crouched and panted as thy step went by!\n\nThou art the vanquished, and insulting man\nBars thy broad bosom as a sparrow's wing;\nHis nerveless arms thine iron sinews bind,\nAnd lead in chains the desert's fallen king;\nAre these the beings that have dared to twine\nTheir feeble threads around those limbs of thine?\n\nSo must it be; the weaker, wiser race,\nThat wields the tempest and that rides the sea,\nEven in the stillness of thy solitude\nMust teach the lesson of its power to thee;\nAnd thou, the terror of the trembling wild,\nMust bow thy savage strength, the mockery of a child!\n\n\n\n\nTHE STAR AND THE WATER-LILY\n\nTHE sun stepped down from his golden throne.\nAnd lay in the silent sea,\nAnd the Lily had folded her satin leaves,\nFor a sleepy thing was she;\nWhat is the Lily dreaming of?\nWhy crisp the waters blue?\nSee, see, she is lifting her varnished lid!\nHer white leaves are glistening through!\n\nThe Rose is cooling his burning cheek\nIn the lap of the breathless tide;--\nThe Lily hath sisters fresh and fair,\nThat would lie by the Rose's side;\nHe would love her better than all the rest,\nAnd he would be fond and true;--\nBut the Lily unfolded her weary lids,\nAnd looked at the sky so blue.\n\nRemember, remember, thou silly one,\nHow fast will thy summer glide,\nAnd wilt thou wither a virgin pale,\nOr flourish a blooming bride?\nOh, the Rose is old, and thorny, and cold,\n\"And he lives on earth,\" said she;\n\"But the Star is fair and he lives in the air,\nAnd he shall my bridegroom be.\"\n\nBut what if the stormy cloud should come,\nAnd ruffle the silver sea?\nWould he turn his eye from the distant sky,\nTo smile on a thing like thee?\nOh no, fair Lily, he will not send\nOne ray from his far-off throne;\nThe winds shall blow and the waves shall flow,\nAnd thou wilt be left alone.\n\nThere is not a leaf on the mountain-top,\nNor a drop of evening dew,\nNor a golden sand on the sparkling shore,\nNor a pearl in the waters blue,\nThat he has not cheered with his fickle smile,\nAnd warmed with his faithless beam,--\nAnd will he be true to a pallid flower,\nThat floats on the quiet stream?\n\nAlas for the Lily! she would not heed,\nBut turned to the skies afar,\nAnd bared her breast to the trembling ray\nThat shot from the rising star;\nThe cloud came over the darkened sky,\nAnd over the waters wide\nShe looked in vain through the beating rain,\nAnd sank in the stormy tide.\n\n\n\n\"A SPANISH GIRL IN REVERIE,\"\n\nSHE twirled the string of golden beads,\nThat round her neck was hung,---\nMy grandsire's gift; the good old man\nLoved girls when he was young;\nAnd, bending lightly o'er the cord,\nAnd turning half away,\nWith something like a youthful sigh,\nThus spoke the maiden gray:--\n\n\"Well, one may trail her silken robe,\nAnd bind her locks with pearls,\nAnd one may wreathe the woodland rose\nAmong her floating curls;\nAnd one may tread the dewy grass,\nAnd one the marble floor,\nNor half-hid bosom heave the less,\nNor broidered corset more!\n\n\"Some years ago, a dark-eyed girl\nWas sitting in the shade,--\nThere's something brings her to my mind\nIn that young dreaming maid,--\nAnd in her hand she held a flower,\nA flower, whose speaking hue\nSaid, in the language of the heart,\n'Believe the giver true.'\n\n\"And, as she looked upon its leaves,\nThe maiden made a vow\nTo wear it when the bridal wreath\nWas woven for her brow;\nShe watched the flower, as, day by day,\nThe leaflets curled and died;\nBut he who gave it never came\nTo claim her for his bride.\n\n\"Oh, many a summer's morning glow\nHas lent the rose its ray,\nAnd many a winter's drifting snow\nHas swept its bloom away;\nBut she has kept that faithless pledge\nTo this, her winter hour,\nAnd keeps it still, herself alone,\nAnd wasted like the flower.\"\n\nHer pale lip quivered, and the light\nGleamed in her moistening eyes;--\nI asked her how she liked the tints\nIn those Castilian skies?\n\"She thought them misty,--'t was perhaps\nBecause she stood too near;\"\nShe turned away, and as she turned\nI saw her wipe a tear.\n\n\n\n\nA ROMAN AQUEDUCT\n\nTHE sun-browned girl, whose limbs recline\nWhen noon her languid hand has laid\nHot on the green flakes of the pine,\nBeneath its narrow disk of shade;\n\nAs, through the flickering noontide glare,\nShe gazes on the rainbow chain\nOf arches, lifting once in air\nThe rivers of the Roman's plain;--\n\nSay, does her wandering eye recall\nThe mountain-current's icy wave,--\nOr for the dead one tear let fall,\nWhose founts are broken by their grave?\n\nFrom stone to stone the ivy weaves\nHer braided tracery's winding veil,\nAnd lacing stalks and tangled leaves\nNod heavy in the drowsy gale.\n\nAnd lightly floats the pendent vine,\nThat swings beneath her slender bow,\nArch answering arch,--whose rounded line\nSeems mirrored in the wreath below.\n\nHow patient Nature smiles at Fame!\nThe weeds, that strewed the victor's way,\nFeed on his dust to shroud his name,\nGreen where his proudest towers decay.\n\nSee, through that channel, empty now,\nThe scanty rain its tribute pours,--\nWhich cooled the lip and laved the brow\nOf conquerors from a hundred shores.\n\nThus bending o'er the nation's bier,\nWhose wants the captive earth supplied,\nThe dew of Memory's passing tear\nFalls on the arches of her pride!\n\n\n\n\nFROM A BACHELOR'S PRIVATE JOURNAL\n\nSWEET Mary, I have never breathed\nThe love it were in vain to name;\nThough round my heart a serpent wreathed,\nI smiled, or strove to smile, the same.\n\nOnce more the pulse of Nature glows\nWith faster throb and fresher fire,\nWhile music round her pathway flows,\nLike echoes from a hidden lyre.\n\nAnd is there none with me to share\nThe glories of the earth and sky?\nThe eagle through the pathless air\nIs followed by one burning eye.\n\nAh no! the cradled flowers may wake,\nAgain may flow the frozen sea,\nFrom every cloud a star may break,--\nThere conies no second spring to me.\n\nGo,--ere the painted toys of youth\nAre crushed beneath the tread of years;\nEre visions have been chilled to truth,\nAnd hopes are washed away in tears.\n\nGo,--for I will not bid thee weep,--\nToo soon my sorrows will be thine,\nAnd evening's troubled air shall sweep\nThe incense from the broken shrine.\n\nIf Heaven can hear the dying tone\nOf chords that soon will cease to thrill,\nThe prayer that Heaven has heard alone\nMay bless thee when those chords are still.\n\n\n\n\nLA GRISETTE\n\nAs Clemence! when I saw thee last\nTrip down the Rue de Seine,\nAnd turning, when thy form had past,\nI said, \"We meet again,\"--\nI dreamed not in that idle glance\nThy latest image came,\nAnd only left to memory's trance\nA shadow and a name.\n\nThe few strange words my lips had taught\nThy timid voice to speak,\nTheir gentler signs, which often brought\nFresh roses to thy cheek,\nThe trailing of thy long loose hair\nBent o'er my couch of pain,\nAll, all returned, more sweet, more fair;\nOh, had we met again!\n\nI walked where saint and virgin keep\nThe vigil lights of Heaven,\nI knew that thou hadst woes to weep,\nAnd sins to be forgiven;\nI watched where Genevieve was laid,\nI knelt by Mary's shrine,\nBeside me low, soft voices prayed;\nAlas! but where was thine?\n\nAnd when the morning sun was bright,\nWhen wind and wave were calm,\nAnd flamed, in thousand-tinted light,\nThe rose of Notre Dame,\nI wandered through the haunts of men,\nFrom Boulevard to Quai,\nTill, frowning o'er Saint Etienne,\nThe Pantheon's shadow lay.\n\nIn vain, in vain; we meet no more,\nNor dream what fates befall;\nAnd long upon the stranger's shore\nMy voice on thee may call,\nWhen years have clothed the line in moss\nThat tells thy name and days,\nAnd withered, on thy simple cross,\nThe wreaths of Pere-la-Chaise!\n\n\n\n\nOUR YANKEE GIRLS\n\nLET greener lands and bluer skies,\nIf such the wide earth shows,\nWith fairer cheeks and brighter eyes,\nMatch us the star and rose;\nThe winds that lift the Georgian's veil,\nOr wave Circassia's curls,\nWaft to their shores the sultan's sail,--\nWho buys our Yankee girls?\n\nThe gay grisette, whose fingers touch\nLove's thousand chords so well;\nThe dark Italian, loving much,\nBut more than one can tell;\nAnd England's fair-haired, blue-eyed dame,\nWho binds her brow with pearls;--\nYe who have seen them, can they shame\nOur own sweet Yankee girls?\n\nAnd what if court or castle vaunt\nIts children loftier born?--\nWho heeds the silken tassel's flaunt\nBeside the golden corn?\nThey ask not for the dainty toil\nOf ribboned knights and earls,\nThe daughters of the virgin soil,\nOur freeborn Yankee girls!\n\nBy every hill whose stately pines\nWave their dark arms above\nThe home where some fair being shines,\nTo warm the wilds with love,\nFrom barest rock to bleakest shore\nWhere farthest sail unfurls,\nThat stars and stripes are streaming o'er,--\nGod bless our Yankee girls!\n\n\n\n\nL'INCONNUE\n\nIs thy name Mary, maiden fair?\nSuch should, methinks, its music be;\nThe sweetest name that mortals bear\nWere best befitting thee;\nAnd she to whom it once was given,\nWas half of earth and half of heaven.\n\nI hear thy voice, I see thy smile,\nI look upon thy folded hair;\nAh! while we dream not they beguile,\nOur hearts are in the snare;\nAnd she who chains a wild bird's wing\nMust start not if her captive sing.\n\nSo, lady, take the leaf that falls,\nTo all but thee unseen, unknown;\nWhen evening shades thy silent walls,\nThen read it all alone;\nIn stillness read, in darkness seal,\nForget, despise, but not reveal!\n\n\n\n\nSTANZAS\n\nSTRANGE! that one lightly whispered tone\nIs far, far sweeter unto me,\nThan all the sounds that kiss the earth,\nOr breathe along the sea;\nBut, lady, when thy voice I greet,\nNot heavenly music seems so sweet.\n\nI look upon the fair blue skies,\nAnd naught but empty air I see;\nBut when I turn me to thin eyes,\nIt seemeth unto me\nTen thousand angels spread their wings\nWithin those little azure rings.\n\nThe lily bath the softest leaf\nThat ever western breeze bath fanned,\nBut thou shalt have the tender flower,\nSo I may take thy hand;\nThat little hand to me doth yield\nMore joy than all the broidered field.\n\nO lady! there be many things\nThat seem right fair, below, above;\nBut sure not one among them all\nIs half so sweet as love;--\nLet us not pay our vows alone,\nBut join two altars both in one.\n\n\n\n\nLINES BY A CLERK\n\nOH! I did love her dearly,\nAnd gave her toys and rings,\nAnd I thought she meant sincerely,\nWhen she took my pretty things.\nBut her heart has grown as icy\nAs a fountain in the fall,\nAnd her love, that was so spicy,\nIt did not last at all.\n\nI gave her once a locket,\nIt was filled with my own hair,\nAnd she put it in her pocket\nWith very special care.\nBut a jeweller has got it,--\nHe offered it to me,--\nAnd another that is not it\nAround her neck I see.\n\nFor my cooings and my billings\nI do not now complain,\nBut my dollars and my shillings\nWill never come again;\nThey were earned with toil and sorrow,\nBut I never told her that,\nAnd now I have to borrow,\nAnd want another hat.\n\nThink, think, thou cruel Emma,\nWhen thou shalt hear my woe,\nAnd know my sad dilemma,\nThat thou hast made it so.\nSee, see my beaver rusty,\nLook, look upon this hole,\nThis coat is dim and dusty;\nOh let it rend thy soul!\n\nBefore the gates of fashion\nI daily bent my knee,\nBut I sought the shrine of passion,\nAnd found my idol,--thee.\nThough never love intenser\nHad bowed a soul before it,\nThine eye was on the censer,\nAnd not the hand that bore it.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PHILOSOPHER TO HIS LOVE\n\nDEAREST, a look is but a ray\nReflected in a certain way;\nA word, whatever tone it wear,\nIs but a trembling wave of air;\nA touch, obedience to a clause\nIn nature's pure material laws.\n\nThe very flowers that bend and meet,\nIn sweetening others, grow more sweet;\nThe clouds by day, the stars by night,\nInweave their floating locks of light;\nThe rainbow, Heaven's own forehead's braid,\nIs but the embrace of sun and shade.\n\nOh! in the hour when I shall feel\nThose shadows round my senses steal,\nWhen gentle eyes are weeping o'er\nThe clay that feels their tears no more,\nThen let thy spirit with me be,\nOr some sweet angel, likest thee!\n\nHow few that love us have we found!\nHow wide the world that girds them round\nLike mountain streams we meet and part,\nEach living in the other's heart,\nOur course unknown, our hope to be\nYet mingled in the distant sea.\n\nBut Ocean coils and heaves in vain,\nBound in the subtle moonbeam's chain;\nAnd love and hope do but obey\nSome cold, capricious planet's ray,\nWhich lights and leads the tide it charms\nTo Death's dark caves and icy arms.\n\nAlas! one narrow line is drawn,\nThat links our sunset with our dawn;\nIn mist and shade life's morning rose,\nAnd clouds are round it at its close;\nBut ah! no twilight beam ascends\nTo whisper where that evening ends.\n\n\n\n\nTHE POET'S LOT\n\nWHAT is a poet's love?--\nTo write a girl a sonnet,\nTo get a ring, or some such thing,\nAnd fustianize upon it.\n\nWhat is a poet's fame?--\nSad hints about his reason,\nAnd sadder praise from garreteers,\nTo be returned in season.\n\nWhere go the poet's lines?--\nAnswer, ye evening tapers!\nYe auburn locks, ye golden curls,\nSpeak from your folded papers!\n\nChild of the ploughshare, smile;\nBoy of the counter, grieve not,\nThough muses round thy trundle-bed\nTheir broidered tissue weave not.\n\nThe poet's future holds\nNo civic wreath above him;\nNor slated roof, nor varnished chaise,\nNor wife nor child to love him.\n\nMaid of the village inn,\nWho workest woe on satin,\n(The grass in black, the graves in green,\nThe epitaph in Latin,)\n\nTrust not to them who say,\nIn stanzas, they adore thee;\nOh rather sleep in churchyard clay,\nWith urn and cherub o'er thee!\n\n\n\n\nTO A BLANK SHEET OF PAPER\n\nWAN-VISAGED thing! thy virgin leaf\nTo me looks more than deadly pale,\nUnknowing what may stain thee yet,--\nA poem or a tale.\n\nWho can thy unborn meaning scan?\nCan Seer or Sibyl read thee now?\nNo,--seek to trace the fate of man\nWrit on his infant brow.\n\nLove may light on thy snowy cheek,\nAnd shake his Eden-breathing plumes;\nThen shalt thou tell how Lelia smiles,\nOr Angelina blooms.\n\nSatire may lift his bearded lance,\nForestalling Time's slow-moving scythe,\nAnd, scattered on thy little field,\nDisjointed bards may writhe.\n\nPerchance a vision of the night,\nSome grizzled spectre, gaunt and thin,\nOr sheeted corpse, may stalk along,\nOr skeleton may grin.\n\nIf it should be in pensive hour\nSome sorrow-moving theme I try,\nAh, maiden, how thy tears will fall,\nFor all I doom to die!\n\nBut if in merry mood I touch\nThy leaves, then shall the sight of thee\nSow smiles as thick on rosy lips\nAs ripples on the sea.\n\nThe Weekly press shall gladly stoop\nTo bind thee up among its sheaves;\nThe Daily steal thy shining ore,\nTo gild its leaden leaves.\n\nThou hast no tongue, yet thou canst speak,\nTill distant shores shall hear the sound;\nThou hast no life, yet thou canst breathe\nFresh life on all around.\n\nThou art the arena of the wise,\nThe noiseless battle-ground of fame;\nThe sky where halos may be wreathed\nAround the humblest name.\n\nTake, then, this treasure to thy trust,\nTo win some idle reader's smile,\nThen fade and moulder in the dust,\nOr swell some bonfire's pile.\n\n\n\n\nTO THE PORTRAIT OF \"A GENTLEMAN\"\n\nIN THE ATHENIEUM GALLERY\n\nIT may be so,--perhaps thou hast\nA warm and loving heart;\nI will not blame thee for thy face,\nPoor devil as thou art.\n\nThat thing thou fondly deem'st a nose,\nUnsightly though it be,--\nIn spite of all the cold world's scorn,\nIt may be much to thee.\n\nThose eyes,--among thine elder friends\nPerhaps they pass for blue,--\nNo matter,--if a man can see,\nWhat more have eyes to do?\n\nThy mouth,--that fissure in thy face,\nBy something like a chin,--\nMay be a very useful place\nTo put thy victual in.\n\nI know thou hast a wife at home,\nI know thou hast a child,\nBy that subdued, domestic smile\nUpon thy features mild.\n\nThat wife sits fearless by thy side,\nThat cherub on thy knee;\nThey do not shudder at thy looks,\nThey do not shrink from thee.\n\nAbove thy mantel is a hook,--\nA portrait once was there;\nIt was thine only ornament,--\nAlas! that hook is bare.\n\nShe begged thee not to let it go,\nShe begged thee all in vain;\nShe wept,--and breathed a trembling prayer\nTo meet it safe again.\n\nIt was a bitter sight to see\nThat picture torn away;\nIt was a solemn thought to think\nWhat all her friends would say!\n\nAnd often in her calmer hours,\nAnd in her happy dreams,\nUpon its long-deserted hook\nThe absent portrait seems.\n\nThy wretched infant turns his head\nIn melancholy wise,\nAnd looks to meet the placid stare\nOf those unbending eyes.\n\nI never saw thee, lovely one,--\nPerchance I never may;\nIt is not often that we cross\nSuch people in our way;\n\nBut if we meet in distant years,\nOr on some foreign shore,\nSure I can take my Bible oath,\nI've seen that face before.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BALLAD OF THE OYSTERMAN\n\nIT was a tall young oysterman lived by the river-side,\nHis shop was just upon the bank, his boat was on the tide;\nThe daughter of a fisherman, that was so straight and slim,\nLived over on the other bank, right opposite to him.\n\nIt was the pensive oysterman that saw a lovely maid,\nUpon a moonlight evening, a sitting in the shade;\nHe saw her wave her handkerchief, as much as if to say,\n\"I 'm wide awake, young oysterman, and all the folks away.\"\n\nThen up arose the oysterman, and to himself said he,\n\"I guess I 'll leave the skiff at home, for fear that folks should see\nI read it in the story-book, that, for to kiss his dear,\nLeander swam the Hellespont,--and I will swim this here.\"\n\nAnd he has leaped into the waves, and crossed the shining stream,\nAnd he has clambered up the bank, all in the moonlight gleam;\nOh there were kisses sweet as dew, and words as soft as rain,--\nBut they have heard her father's step, and in he leaps again!\n\nOut spoke the ancient fisherman,--\"Oh, what was that, my daughter?\"\n\"'T was nothing but a pebble, sir, I threw into the water.\"\n\"And what is that, pray tell me, love, that paddles off so fast?\"\n\"It's nothing but a porpoise, sir, that 's been a swimming past.\"\n\nOut spoke the ancient fisherman,--\"Now bring me my harpoon!\nI'll get into my fishing-boat, and fix the fellow soon.\"\nDown fell that pretty innocent, as falls a snow-white lamb,\nHer hair drooped round her pallid cheeks, like sea-weed on a clam.\n\nAlas for those two loving ones! she waked not from her swound,\nAnd he was taken with the cramp, and in the waves was drowned;\nBut Fate has metamorphosed them, in pity of their woe,\nAnd now they keep an oyster-shop for mermaids down below.\n\n\n\n\nA NOONTIDE LYRIC\n\nTHE dinner-bell, the dinner-bell\nIs ringing loud and clear;\nThrough hill and plain, through street and lane,\nIt echoes far and near;\nFrom curtained hall and whitewashed stall,\nWherever men can hide,\nLike bursting waves from ocean caves,\nThey float upon the tide.\n\nI smell the smell of roasted meat!\nI hear the hissing fry\nThe beggars know where they can go,\nBut where, oh where shall I?\nAt twelve o'clock men took my hand,\nAt two they only stare,\nAnd eye me with a fearful look,\nAs if I were a bear!\n\nThe poet lays his laurels down,\nAnd hastens to his greens;\nThe happy tailor quits his goose,\nTo riot on his beans;\nThe weary cobbler snaps his thread,\nThe printer leaves his pi;\nHis very devil hath a home,\nBut what, oh what have I?\n\nMethinks I hear an angel voice,\nThat softly seems to say\n\"Pale stranger, all may yet be well,\nThen wipe thy tears away;\nErect thy head, and cock thy hat,\nAnd follow me afar,\nAnd thou shalt have a jolly meal,\nAnd charge it at the bar.\"\n\nI hear the voice! I go! I go!\nPrepare your meat and wine!\nThey little heed their future need\nWho pay not when they dine.\nGive me to-day the rosy bowl,\nGive me one golden dream,--\nTo-morrow kick away the stool,\nAnd dangle from the beam!\n\n\n\n\nTHE HOT SEASON\n\nTHE folks, that on the first of May\nWore winter coats and hose,\nBegan to say, the first of June,\n\"Good Lord! how hot it grows!\"\nAt last two Fahrenheits blew up,\nAnd killed two children small,\nAnd one barometer shot dead\nA tutor with its ball!\n\nNow all day long the locusts sang\nAmong the leafless trees;\nThree new hotels warped inside out,\nThe pumps could only wheeze;\nAnd ripe old wine, that twenty years\nHad cobwebbed o'er in vain,\nCame spouting through the rotten corks\nLike Joly's best champagne.\n\nThe Worcester locomotives did\nTheir trip in half an hour;\nThe Lowell cars ran forty miles\nBefore they checked the power;\nRoll brimstone soon became a drug,\nAnd loco-focos fell;\nAll asked for ice, but everywhere\nSaltpetre was to sell.\n\nPlump men of mornings ordered tights,\nBut, ere the scorching noons,\nTheir candle-moulds had grown as loose\nAs Cossack pantaloons!\nThe dogs ran mad,--men could not try\nIf water they would choose;\nA horse fell dead,--he only left\nFour red-hot, rusty shoes!\n\nBut soon the people could not bear\nThe slightest hint of fire;\nAllusions to caloric drew\nA flood of savage ire;\n\nThe leaves on heat were all torn out\nFrom every book at school,\nAnd many blackguards kicked and caned,\nBecause they said, \"Keep cool!\"\n\nThe gas-light companies were mobbed,\nThe bakers all were shot,\nThe penny press began to talk\nOf lynching Doctor Nott;\nAnd all about the warehouse steps\nWere angry men in droves,\nCrashing and splintering through the doors\nTo smash the patent stoves!\n\nThe abolition men and maids\nWere tanned to such a hue,\nYou scarce could tell them from their friends,\nUnless their eyes were blue;\nAnd, when I left, society\nHad burst its ancient guards,\nAnd Brattle Street and Temple Place\nWere interchanging cards.\n\n\n\n\nA PORTRAIT\n\nA STILL, sweet, placid, moonlight face,\nAnd slightly nonchalant,\nWhich seems to claim a middle place\nBetween one's love and aunt,\nWhere childhood's star has left a ray\nIn woman's sunniest sky,\nAs morning dew and blushing day\nOn fruit and blossom lie.\n\nAnd yet,--and yet I cannot love\nThose lovely lines on steel;\nThey beam too much of heaven above,\nEarth's darker shades to feel;\nPerchance some early weeds of care\nAround my heart have grown,\nAnd brows unfurrowed seem not fair,\nBecause they mock my own.\n\nAlas! when Eden's gates were sealed,\nHow oft some sheltered flower\nBreathed o'er the wanderers of the field,\nLike their own bridal bower;\nYet, saddened by its loveliness,\nAnd humbled by its pride,\nEarth's fairest child they could not bless,\nIt mocked them when they sighed.\n\n\n\n\nAN EVENING THOUGHT\n\nWRITTEN AT SEA\n\nIF sometimes in the dark blue eye,\nOr in the deep red wine,\nOr soothed by gentlest melody,\nStill warms this heart of mine,\nYet something colder in the blood,\nAnd calmer in the brain,\nHave whispered that my youth's bright flood\nEbbs, not to flow again.\n\nIf by Helvetia's azure lake,\nOr Arno's yellow stream,\nEach star of memory could awake,\nAs in my first young dream,\nI know that when mine eye shall greet\nThe hillsides bleak and bare,\nThat gird my home, it will not meet\nMy childhood's sunsets there.\n\n\nOh, when love's first, sweet, stolen kiss\nBurned on my boyish brow,\nWas that young forehead worn as this?\nWas that flushed cheek as now?\nWere that wild pulse and throbbing heart\nLike these, which vainly strive,\nIn thankless strains of soulless art,\nTo dream themselves alive?\n\nAlas! the morning dew is gone,\nGone ere the full of day;\nLife's iron fetter still is on,\nIts wreaths all torn away;\nHappy if still some casual hour\nCan warm the fading shrine,\nToo soon to chill beyond the power\nOf love, or song, or wine!\n\n\n\n\nTHE WASP AND THE HORNET\n\nTHE two proud sisters of the sea,\nIn glory and in doom!--\nWell may the eternal waters be\nTheir broad, unsculptured tomb!\nThe wind that rings along the wave,\nThe clear, unshadowed sun,\nAre torch and trumpet o'er the brave,\nWhose last green wreath is won!\n\nNo stranger-hand their banners furled,\nNo victor's shout they heard;\nUnseen, above them ocean curled,\nSafe by his own pale bird;\nThe gnashing billows heaved and fell;\nWild shrieked the midnight gale;\nFar, far beneath the morning swell\nWere pennon, spar, and sail.\n\nThe land of Freedom! Sea and shore\nAre guarded now, as when\nHer ebbing waves to victory bore\nFair barks and gallant men;\nOh, many a ship of prouder name\nMay wave her starry fold,\nNor trail, with deeper light of fame,\nThe paths they swept of old!\n\n\n\n\n\"QUI VIVE?\"\n\n\"Qui vive?\" The sentry's musket rings,\nThe channelled bayonet gleams;\nHigh o'er him, like a raven's wings\nThe broad tricolored banner flings\nIts shadow, rustling as it swings\nPale in the moonlight beams;\nPass on! while steel-clad sentries keep\nTheir vigil o'er the monarch's sleep,\nThy bare, unguarded breast\nAsks not the unbroken, bristling zone\nThat girds yon sceptred trembler's throne;--\nPass on, and take thy rest!\n\n\"Qui vive?\" How oft the midnight air\nThat startling cry has borne!\nHow oft the evening breeze has fanned\nThe banner of this haughty land,\nO'er mountain snow and desert sand,\nEre yet its folds were torn!\nThrough Jena's carnage flying red,\nOr tossing o'er Marengo's dead,\nOr curling on the towers\nWhere Austria's eagle quivers yet,\nAnd suns the ruffled plumage, wet\nWith battle's crimson showers!\n\n\"Qui vive?\" And is the sentry's cry,--\nThe sleepless soldier's hand,--\nAre these--the painted folds that fly\nAnd lift their emblems, printed high\nOn morning mist and sunset sky--\nThe guardians of a land?\nNo! If the patriot's pulses sleep,\nHow vain the watch that hirelings keep,\nThe idle flag that waves,\nWhen Conquest, with his iron heel,\nTreads down the standards and the steel\nThat belt the soil of slaves!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTES.\n\nPage 6. \"They're as safe as Dan'l Malcolm.\"\nThe following epitaph is still to be read on a tall grave-stone standing\nas yet undisturbed among the transplanted monuments of the dead in Copp's\nHill Burial-Ground, one of the three city cemeteries which have been\ndesecrated and ruined within my own remembrance:--\n\n                        \"Here lies buried in a\n                       Stone Grave 10 feet deep,\n                       Cap' DANIEL MALCOLM Merch'\n                         Who departed this Life\n                           October 23d, 1769,\n                             Aged 44 years,\n                         a true son of Liberty,\n                        a Friend to the Publick,\n                        an Enemy to oppression,\n                        and one of the foremost\n                      in opposing the Revenue Acts\n                              on America.\"\n\nPage 62.
