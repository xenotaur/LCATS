the sea is wide:\n          Dear is the lover by thy side:\n          The sea is treacherous, hungry, deep,\n          And millions o'er its treasures weep.\n\n          His heart relented--strong hearts do;\n          Yet more relenting, oft less true\n          Than those, unyielding, that defy\n          The deathless love of which they die.\n\n          \"As forest saplings, by the sun\n          Together knit till two are one--\n          One trunk, one bark, one sap, one tree--\n          Our hearts have been, should ever be.\n\n          \"Let sharp steel cleave that circling rind,\n          No art its severed strength could bind;\n          Should anger part thy love from mine,\n          Holds earth another heart for thine?\"\n\n          Oh, stubborn pride!
