    "body": "\"Let me put it this way,\" Conners said paternally. \"We expect a certain\namount of decorum from our Washington news correspondents, and that's\nall I'm asking for.\"\n\nJerry Bridges, sitting in the chair opposite his employer's desk, chewed\non his knuckles and said nothing. One part of his mind wanted him to\nplay it cagey, to behave the way the newspaper wanted him to behave, to\nprotect the cozy Washington assignment he had waited four years to get.\nBut another part of him, a rebel part, wanted him to stay on the trail\nof the story he felt sure was about to break.\n\n\"I didn't mean to make trouble, Mr. Conners,\" he said casually. \"It just\nseemed strange, all these exchanges of couriers in the past two days. I\ncouldn't help thinking something was up.\"\n\n\"Even if that's true, we'll hear about it through the usual channels,\"\nConners frowned. \"But getting a senator's secretary drunk to obtain\ninformation--well, that's not only indiscreet, Bridges. It's downright\ndirty.\"\n\nJerry grinned. \"I didn't take _that_ kind of advantage, Mr. Conners. Not\nthat she wasn't a toothsome little dish ...\"\n\n\"Just thank your lucky stars that it didn't go any further. And from now\non--\" He waggled a finger at him. \"Watch your step.\"\n\nJerry got up and ambled to the door. But he turned before leaving and\nsaid:\n\n\"By the way. What do _you_ think is going on?\"\n\n\"I haven't the faintest idea.\"\n\n\"Don't kid me, Mr. Conners. Think it's war?\"\n\n\"That'll be all, Bridges.\"\n\n\n\nThe reporter closed the door behind him, and then strolled out of the\nbuilding into the sunlight.\n\nHe met Ruskin, the fat little AP correspondent, in front of the\nPan-American Building on Constitution Avenue. Ruskin was holding the\nnewspaper that contained the gossip-column item which had started the\nwhole affair, and he seemed more interested in the romantic rather than\npolitical implications. As he walked beside him, he said:\n\n\"So what really happened, pal? That Greta babe really let down her\nhair?\"\n\n\"Where's your decorum?\" Jerry growled.\n\nRuskin giggled. \"Boy, she's quite a dame, all right. I think they ought\nto get the Secret Service to guard her. She really fills out a size 10,\ndon't she?\"\n\n\"Ruskin,\" Jerry said, \"you have a low mind. For a week, this town has\nbeen acting like the _39 Steps_, and all you can think about is dames.\nWhat's the matter with you? Where will you be when the big mushroom\ncloud comes?\"\n\n\"With Greta, I hope,\" Ruskin sighed. \"What a way to get radioactive.\"\n\nThey split off a few blocks later, and Jerry walked until he came to the\nRed Tape Bar & Grill, a favorite hangout of the local journalists. There\nwere three other newsmen at the bar, and they gave him snickering\ngreetings. He took a small table in the rear and ate his meal in sullen\nsilence.\n\nIt wasn't the newsmen's jibes that bothered him; it was the certainty\nthat something of major importance was happening in the capitol. There\nhad been hourly conferences at the White House, flying visits by State\nDepartment officials, mysterious conferences involving members of the\nScience Commission. So far, the byword had been secrecy. They knew that\nSenator Spocker, chairman of the Congressional Science Committee, had\nbeen involved in every meeting, but Senator Spocker was unavailable. His\nsecretary, however, was a little more obliging ...\n\nJerry looked up from his coffee and blinked when he saw who was coming\nthrough the door of the Bar & Grill. So did every other patron, but for\ndifferent reasons. Greta Johnson had that effect upon men. Even the\nconfining effect of a mannishly-tailored suit didn't hide her\noutrageously feminine qualities.\n\nShe walked straight to his table, and he stood up.\n\n\"They told me you might be here,\" she said, breathing hard. \"I just\nwanted to thank you for last night.\"\n\n\"Look, Greta--\"\n\n_Wham!_ Her hand, small and delicate, felt like a slab of lead when it\nslammed into his cheek. She left a bruise five fingers wide, and then\nturned and stalked out.\n\n\n\nHe ran after her, the restaurant proprietor shouting about the unpaid\nbill. It took a rapid dog-trot to reach her side.\n\n\"Greta, listen!\" he panted. \"You don't understand about last night. It\nwasn't the way that lousy columnist said--\"\n\nShe stopped in her tracks.\n\n\"I wouldn't have minded so much if you'd gotten me drunk. But to _use_\nme, just to get a story--\"\n\n\"But I'm a _reporter_, damn it. It's my job. I'd do it again if I\nthought you knew anything.\"\n\nShe was pouting now. \"Well, how do you suppose I feel, knowing you're\nonly interested in me because of the Senator? Anyway, I'll probably lose\nmy job, and then you won't have _any_ use for me.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Greta,\" Jerry said sadly.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Good-bye. I suppose you won't want to see me any more.\"\n\n\"Did I say that?\"\n\n\"It just won't be any use. We'll always have this thing between us.\"\n\nShe looked at him for a moment, and then touched his bruised cheek with\na tender, motherly gesture.\n\n\"Your poor face,\" she murmured, and then sighed. \"Oh, well. I guess\nthere's no use fighting it. Maybe if I _did_ tell you what I know, we\ncould act _human_ again.\"\n\n\"Greta!\"\n\n\"But if you print one _word_ of it, Jerry Bridges, I'll never speak to\nyou again!\"\n\n\"Honey,\" Jerry said, taking her arm, \"you can trust me like a brother.\"\n\n\"That's _not_ the idea,\" Greta said stiffly.\n\nIn a secluded booth at the rear of a restaurant unfrequented by newsmen,\nGreta leaned forward and said:\n\n\"At first, they thought it was another sputnik.\"\n\n\"_Who_ did?\"\n\n\"The State Department, silly. They got reports from the observatories\nabout another sputnik being launched by the Russians. Only the Russians\ndenied it. Then there were joint meetings, and nobody could figure out\n_what_ the damn thing was.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Jerry said dizzily. \"You mean to tell me there's\nanother of those metal moons up there?\"\n\n\"But it's not a moon. That's the big point. It's a spaceship.\"\n\n\"A _what_?\"\n\n\"A spaceship,\" Greta said coolly, sipping lemonade. \"They have been in\ncontact with it now for about three days, and they're thinking of\ncalling a plenary session of the UN just to figure out what to do about\nit. The only hitch is, Russia doesn't want to wait that long, and is\nasking for a hurry-up summit meeting to make a decision.\"\n\n\"A decision about what?\"\n\n\"About the Venusians, of course.\"\n\n\"Greta,\" Jerry said mildly, \"I think you're still a little woozy from\nlast night.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly. The spaceship's from Venus; they've already established\nthat. And the people on it--I _guess_ they're people--want to know if\nthey can land their delegate.\"\n\n\"Their what?\"\n\n\"Their delegate. They came here for some kind of conference, I guess.\nThey know about the UN and everything, and they want to take part. They\nsay that with all the satellites being launched, that our affairs are\n_their_ affairs, too. It's kind of confusing, but that's what they say.\"\n\n\"You mean these Venusians speak English?\"\n\n\"And Russian. And French. And German. And everything I guess. They've\nbeen having radio talks with practically every country for the past\nthree days. Like I say, they want to establish diplomatic relations or\nsomething. The Senator thinks that if we don't agree, they might do\nsomething drastic, like blow us all up. It's kind of scary.\" She\nshivered delicately.\n\n\"You're taking it mighty calm,\" he said ironically.\n\n\"Well, how else can I take it? I'm not even supposed to _know_ about it,\nexcept that the Senator is so careless about--\" She put her fingers to\nher lips. \"Oh, dear, now you'll really think I'm terrible.\"\n\n\"Terrible? I think you're wonderful!\"\n\n\"And you promise not to print it?\"\n\n\"Didn't I say I wouldn't?\"\n\n\"Y-e-s. But you know, you're a liar sometimes, Jerry. I've noticed that\nabout you.\"\n\n\n\nThe press secretary's secretary, a massive woman with gray hair and\nimpervious to charm, guarded the portals of his office with all the\nindomitable will of the U. S. Marines. But Jerry Bridges tried.\n\n\"You don't understand, Lana,\" he said. \"I don't want to _see_ Mr.\nHowells. I just want you to _give_ him something.\"\n\n\"My name's not Lana, and I _can't_ deliver any messages.\"\n\n\"But this is something he _wants_ to see.\" He handed her an envelope,\nstamped URGENT. \"Do it for me, Hedy. And I'll buy you the flashiest pair\nof diamond earrings in Washington.\"\n\n\"Well,\" the woman said, thawing slightly. \"I _could_ deliver it with his\nnext batch of mail.\"\n\n\"When will that be?\"\n\n\"In an hour. He's in a terribly important meeting right now.\"\n\n\"You've got some mail right there. Earrings and a bracelet to match.\"\n\nShe looked at him with exasperation, and then gathered up a stack of\nmemorandums and letters, his own envelope atop it. She came out of the\npress secretary's office two minutes later with Howells himself, and\nHowells said: \"You there, Bridges. Come in here.\"\n\n\"Yes, _sir_!\" Jerry said, breezing by the waiting reporters with a grin\nof triumph.\n\nThere were six men in the room, three in military uniform. Howells poked\nthe envelope towards Jerry, and snapped:\n\n\"This note of yours. Just what do you think it means?\"\n\n\"You know better than I do, Mr. Howells. I'm just doing my job; I think\nthe public has a right to know about this spaceship that's flying\naround--\"\n\n\n\nHis words brought an exclamation from the others. Howells sighed, and\nsaid:\n\n\"Mr. Bridges, you don't make it easy for us. It's our opinion that\nsecrecy is essential, that leakage of the story might cause panic. Since\nyou're the only unauthorized person who knows of it, we have two\nchoices. One of them is to lock you up.\"\n\nJerry swallowed hard.\n\n\"The other is perhaps more practical,\" Howells said. \"You'll be taken\ninto our confidence, and allowed to accompany those officials who will\nbe admitted to the landing site. But you will _not_ be allowed to relay\nthe story to the press until such a time as _all_ correspondents are\ninformed. That won't give you a 'scoop' if that's what you call it, but\nyou'll be an eyewitness. That should be worth something.\"\n\n\"It's worth a lot,\" Jerry said eagerly. \"Thanks, Mr. Howells.\"\n\n\"Don't thank me, I'm not doing you any _personal_ favor. Now about the\nlanding tonight--\"\n\n\"You mean the spaceship's coming down?\"\n\n\"Yes. A special foreign ministers conference was held this morning, and\na decision was reached to accept the delegate. Landing instructions are\nbeing given at Los Alamos, and the ship will presumably land around\nmidnight tonight. There will be a jet leaving Washington Airport at\nnine, and you'll be on it. Meanwhile, consider yourself in custody.\"\n\n\n\nThe USAF jet transport wasn't the only secrecy-shrouded aircraft that\ntook off that evening from Washington Airport. But Jerry Bridges,\nsitting in the rear seat flanked by two Sphinx-like Secret Service men,\nknew that he was the only passenger with non-official status aboard.\n\nIt was only a few minutes past ten when they arrived at the air base at\nLos Alamos. The desert sky was cloudy and starless, and powerful\nsearchlights probed the thick cumulus. There were sleek, purring black\nautos waiting to rush the air passengers to some unnamed destination.\nThey drove for twenty minutes across a flat ribbon of desert road, until\nJerry sighted what appeared to be a circle of newly-erected lights in\nthe middle of nowhere. On the perimeter, official vehicles were parked\nin orderly rows, and four USAF trailer trucks were in evidence, their\nradarscopes turning slowly. There was activity everywhere, but it was\nwell-ordered and unhurried. They had done a good job of keeping the\nexcitement contained.\n\nHe was allowed to leave the car and stroll unescorted. He tried to talk\nto some of the scurrying officials, but to no avail. Finally, he\ncontented himself by sitting on the sand, his back against the grill of\na staff car, smoking one cigarette after another.\n\nAs the minutes ticked off, the activity became more frenetic around him.\nThen the pace slowed, and he knew the appointed moment was approaching.\nStillness returned to the desert, and tension was a tangible substance\nin the night air.\n\nThe radarscopes spun slowly.\n\nThe searchlights converged in an intricate pattern.\n\nThen the clouds seemed to part!\n\n\"Here she comes!\" a voice shouted. And in a moment, the calm was\nshattered. At first, he saw nothing. A faint roar was started in the\nheavens, and it became a growl that increased in volume until even the\nshouting voices could no longer be heard. Then the crisscrossing lights\nstruck metal, glancing off the gleaming body of a descending object.\nLarger and larger the object grew, until it assumed the definable shape\nof a squat silver funnel, falling in a perfect straight line towards the\ncenter of the light-ringed area. When it hit, a dust cloud obscured it\nfrom sight.\n\n\n\nA loudspeaker blared out an unintelligible order, but its message was\nclear. No one moved from their position.\n\nFinally, a three-man team, asbestos-clad, lead-shielded, stepped out\nfrom the ring of spectators. They carried geiger counters on long poles\nbefore them.\n\nJerry held his breath as they approached the object; only when they\nwere yards away did he appreciate its size. It wasn't large; not more\nthan fifteen feet in total circumference.\n\nOne of the three men waved a gloved hand.\n\n\"It's okay,\" a voice breathed behind him. \"No radiation ...\"\n\nSlowly, the ring of spectators closed tighter. They were twenty yards\nfrom the ship when the voice spoke to them.\n\n\"Greetings from Venus,\" it said, and then repeated the phrase in six\nlanguages. \"The ship you see is a Venusian Class 7 interplanetary\nrocket, built for one-passenger. It is clear of all radiation, and is\nperfectly safe to approach. There is a hatch which may be opened by an\nautomatic lever in the side. Please open this hatch and remove the\npassenger.\"\n\nAn Air Force General whom Jerry couldn't identify stepped forward. He\ncircled the ship warily, and then said something to the others. They\ncame closer, and he touched a small lever on the silvery surface of the\nfunnel.\n\nA door slid open.\n\n\"It's a box!\" someone said.\n\n\"A crate--\"\n\n\"Colligan! Moore! Schaffer! Lend a hand here--\"\n\nA trio came forward and hoisted the crate out of the ship. Then the\nvoice spoke again; Jerry deduced that it must have been activated by the\ndecreased load of the ship.\n\n\"Please open the crate. You will find our delegate within. We trust you\nwill treat him with the courtesy of an official emissary.\"\n\nThey set to work on the crate, its gray plastic material giving in\nreadily to the application of their tools. But when it was opened, they\nstood aside in amazement and consternation.\n\nThere were a variety of metal pieces packed within, protected by a filmy\npacking material.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" the general said. \"Here's a book--\"\n\nHe picked up a gray-bound volume, and opened its cover.\n\n\"'Instructions for assembling Delegate,'\" he read aloud. \"'First, remove\nall parts and arrange them in the following order. A-1, central nervous\nsystem housing. A-2 ...'\" He looked up. \"It's an instruction book,\" he\nwhispered. \"We're supposed to _build_ the damn thing.\"\n\n\n\nThe Delegate, a handsomely constructed robot almost eight feet tall, was\npieced together some three hours later, by a team of scientists and\nengineers who seemed to find the Venusian instructions as elementary as\na blueprint in an Erector set. But simple as the job was, they were\nobviously impressed by the mechanism they had assembled. It stood\nimpassive until they obeyed the final instruction. \"Press Button K ...\"\n\nThey found button K, and pressed it.\n\nThe robot bowed.\n\n\"Thank you, gentlemen,\" it said, in sweet, unmetallic accents. \"Now if\nyou will please escort me to the meeting place ...\"\n\n\n\nIt wasn't until three days after the landing that Jerry Bridges saw the\nDelegate again. Along with a dozen assorted government officials, Army\nofficers, and scientists, he was quartered in a quonset hut in Fort Dix,\nNew Jersey. Then, after seventy-two frustrating hours, he was escorted\nby Marine guard into New York City. No one told him his destination, and\nit wasn't until he saw the bright strips of light across the face of the\nUnited Nations building that he knew where the meeting was to be held.\n\nBut his greatest surprise was yet to come. The vast auditorium which\nhoused the general assembly was filled to its capacity, but there were\nnew faces behind the plaques which designated the member nations. He\ncouldn't believe his eyes at first, but as the meeting got under way, he\nknew that it was true. The highest echelons of the world's governments\nwere represented, even--Jerry gulped at the realization--Nikita\nKhrushchev himself. It was a summit meeting such as he had never dreamed\npossible, a summit meeting without benefit of long foreign minister's\ndebate. And the cause of it all, a placid, highly-polished metal robot,\nwas seated blithely at a desk which bore the designation:\n\n                                 VENUS.\n\nThe robot delegate stood up.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" it said into the microphone, and the great men at the\ncouncil tables strained to hear the translator's version through their\nheadphones, \"Gentlemen, I thank you for your prompt attention. I come as\na Delegate from a great neighbor planet, in the interests of peace and\nprogress for all the solar system. I come in the belief that peace is\nthe responsibility of individuals, of nations, and now of worlds, and\nthat each is dependent upon the other. I speak to you now through the\nelectronic instrumentation which has been created for me, and I come to\noffer your planet not merely a threat, a promise, or an easy\nsolution--but a challenge.\"\n\nThe council room stirred.\n\n\"Your earth satellites have been viewed with interest by the astronomers\nof our world, and we foresee the day when contact between our planets\nwill be commonplace. As for ourselves, we have hitherto had little\ndesire to explore beyond our realm, being far too occupied with internal\nmatters. But our isolation cannot last in the face of your progress, so\nwe believe that we must take part in your affairs.\n\n\"Here, then, is our challenge. Continue your struggle of ideas, compete\nwith each other for the minds of men, fight your bloodless battles, if\nyou know no other means to attain progress. But do all this _without_\nunleashing the terrible forces of power now at your command. Once\nunleashed, these forces may or may not destroy all that you have gained.\nBut we, the scientists of Venus, promise you this--that on the very day\nyour conflict deteriorates into heedless violence, we will not stand by\nand let the ugly contagion spread. On that day, we of Venus will act\nswiftly, mercilessly, and relentlessly--to destroy your world\ncompletely.\"\n\nAgain, the meeting room exploded in a babble of languages.\n\n\"The vessel which brought me here came as a messenger of peace. But\nenvision it, men of Earth, as a messenger of war. Unstoppable,\ninexorable, it may return, bearing a different Delegate from Venus--a\nDelegate of Death, who speaks not in words, but in the explosion of\natoms. Think of thousands of such Delegates, fired from a vantage point\nfar beyond the reach of your retaliation. This is the promise and the\nchallenge that will hang in your night sky from this moment forward.\nLook at the planet Venus, men of Earth, and see a Goddess of Vengeance,\npoised to wreak its wrath upon those who betray the peace.\"\n\nThe Delegate sat down.\n\n\n\nFour days later, a mysterious explosion rocked the quiet sands of Los\nAlamos, and the Venus spacecraft was no more. Two hours after that, the\nrobot delegate, its message delivered, its mission fulfilled, requested\nto be locked inside a bombproof chamber. When the door was opened, the\nDelegate was an exploded ruin.\n\nThe news flashed with lightning speed over the world, and Jerry Bridges'\neyewitness accounts of the incredible event was syndicated throughout\nthe nation. But his sudden celebrity left him vaguely unsatisfied.\n\nHe tried to explain his feeling to Greta on his first night back in\nWashington. They were in his apartment, and it was the first time Greta\nhad consented to pay him the visit.\n\n\"Well, what's _bothering_ you?\" Greta pouted. \"You've had the biggest\nstory of the year under your byline. I should think you'd be tickled\npink.\"\n\n\"It's not that,\" Jerry said moodily. \"But ever since I heard the\nDelegate speak, something's been nagging me.\"\n\n\"But don't you think he's done good? Don't you think they'll be\nimpressed by what he said?\"\n\n\"I'm not worried about that. I think that damn robot did more for\npeace than anything that's ever come along in this cockeyed world. But\nstill ...\"\n\nGreta snuggled up to him on the sofa. \"You worry too much. Don't you\never think of anything else? You should learn to relax. It can be fun.\"\n\nShe started to prove it to him, and Jerry responded the way a normal,\nhealthy male usually does. But in the middle of an embrace, he cried\nout:\n\n\"Wait a minute!\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"I just thought of something! Now where the hell did I put my old\nnotebooks?\"\n\nHe got up from the sofa and went scurrying to a closet. From a debris of\ncardboard boxes, he found a worn old leather brief case, and cackled\nwith delight when he found the yellowed notebooks inside.\n\n\"What _are_ they?\" Greta said.\n\n\"My old school notebooks. Greta, you'll have to excuse me. But there's\nsomething I've got to do, right away!\"\n\n\"That's all right with me,\" Greta said haughtily. \"I know when I'm not\nwanted.\"\n\nShe took her hat and coat from the hall closet, gave him one last chance\nto change his mind, and then left.\n\nFive minutes later, Jerry Bridges was calling the airlines.\n\n\n\nIt had been eleven years since Jerry had walked across the campus of\nClifton University, heading for the ivy-choked main building. It was\nremarkable how little had changed, but the students seemed incredibly\nyoung. He was winded by the time he asked the pretty girl at the desk\nwhere Professor Martin Coltz could be located.\n\n\"Professor Coltz?\" She stuck a pencil to her mouth. \"Well, I guess he'd\nbe in the Holland Laboratory about now.\"\n\n\"Holland Laboratory? What's that?\"\n\n\"Oh, I guess that was after your time, wasn't it?\"\n\nJerry felt decrepit, but managed to say: \"It must be something new since\nI was here. Where is this place?\"\n\nHe followed her directions, and located a fresh-painted building three\nhundred yards from the men's dorm. He met a student at the door, who\ntold him that Professor Coltz would be found in the physics department.\n\nThe room was empty when Jerry entered, except for the single stooped\nfigure vigorously erasing a blackboard. He turned when the door opened.\nIf the students looked younger, Professor Coltz was far older than Jerry\nremembered. He was a tall man, with an unruly confusion of straight gray\nhair. He blinked when Jerry said:\n\n\"Hello, Professor. Do you remember me? Jerry Bridges?\"\n\n\"Of course! I thought of you only yesterday, when I saw your name in the\npapers--\"\n\nThey sat at facing student desks, and chatted about old times. But Jerry\nwas impatient to get to the point of his visit, and he blurted out:\n\n\"Professor Coltz, something's been bothering me. It bothered me from the\nmoment I heard the Delegate speak. I didn't know what it was until last\nnight, when I dug out my old college notebooks. Thank God I kept them.\"\n\nColtz's eyes were suddenly hooded.\n\n\"What do you mean, Jerry?\"\n\n\"There was something about the Robot's speech that sounded familiar--I\ncould have sworn I'd heard some of the words before. I couldn't prove\nanything until I checked my old notes, and here's what I found.\"\n\nHe dug into his coat pocket and produced a sheet of paper. He unfolded\nit and read aloud.\n\n\"'It's my belief that peace is the responsibility of individuals, of\nnations, and someday, even of worlds ...' Sound familiar, Professor?\"\n\nColtz shifted uncomfortably. \"I don't recall every silly thing I said,\nJerry.\"\n\n\"But it's an interesting coincidence, isn't it, Professor? These very\nwords were spoken by the Delegate from Venus.\"\n\n\"A coincidence--\"\n\n\"Is it? But I also remember your interest in robotics. I'll never forget\nthat mechanical homing pigeon you constructed. And you've probably\nlearned much more these past eleven years.\"\n\n\"What are you driving at, Jerry?\"\n\n\"Just this, Professor. I had a little daydream, recently, and I want you\nto hear it. I dreamed about a group of teachers, scientists, and\nengineers, a group who were suddenly struck by an exciting, incredible\nidea. A group that worked in the quiet and secrecy of a University on a\nfantastic scheme to force the idea of peace into the minds of the\nworld's big shots. Does my dream interest you, Professor?\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"Well, I dreamt that this group would secretly launch an earth satellite\nof their own, and arrange for the nose cone to come down safely at a\ncertain time and place. They would install a marvelous electronic robot\nwithin the cone, ready to be assembled. They would beam a radio message\nto earth from the cone, seemingly as if it originated from their\n'spaceship.' Then, when the Robot was assembled, they would speak\nthrough it to demand peace for all mankind ...\"\n\n\"Jerry, if you do this--\"\n\n\"You don't have to say it, Professor, I know what you're thinking. I'm\na reporter, and my business is to tell the world everything I know. But\nif I did it, there might not be a world for me to write about, would\nthere? No, thanks, Professor. As far as I'm concerned, what I told you\nwas nothing more than a daydream.\"\n\n\n\nJerry braked the convertible to a halt, and put his arm around Greta's\nshoulder. She looked up at the star-filled night, and sighed\nromantically.\n\nJerry pointed. \"That one.\"\n\nGreta shivered closer to him.\n\n\"And to think what that terrible planet can do to us!\"\n\n\"Oh, I dunno. Venus is also the Goddess of Love.\"\n\nHe swung his other arm around her, and Venus winked approvingly.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n",
