    "body": "You must understand that Palmer loved his wife as much as ever, or he\nwould never have thought of his simple little scheme at all. It was\nentirely for her own good, as he had told himself a dozen times in\nthe past day. And with that he stilled whatever qualms of conscience\nhe might otherwise have had. He didn't think of himself as being\nsomething of a murderer.\n\nShe was sitting at the artificial fireplace, a cheerful relic of\nancient days, reading just as peacefully as if she had been back home\non Mars, instead of on this desolate outpost of space. She had adjusted\nquickly to the loneliness and the strangeness of this life--to the\nabsence of friends, the need for conserving air, the strange feeling of\nan artificial gravity that varied slightly at the whim of impurities in\nthe station fuel. To everything, in fact, but her husband.\n\nShe seemed to sense his eyes on her, for she looked up and smiled.\n\"Feeling all right, dear?\" she asked.\n\n\"Naturally. How about you?\"\n\n\"As well as can be expected.\"\n\n\"Not very good, then.\"\n\nShe didn't reply, and he thought, _She hates to admit it, but she\nreally envies me. Well, I'll fix it so that she needn't any more._ And\nhe stared through the thick, transparent metal window at the beauty of\nthe stars, their light undimmed by dust or atmosphere.\n\nThe stories told about the wretchedness of the lighthouse keepers who\nlived on asteroids didn't apply at all to this particular bit of cosmic\nrock. Life here had been wonderful, incredibly satisfying. At least it\nhad been that way for him. And now it would be the same way for his\nwife as well.\n\nHe would have denied it hotly if you had accused him of finding\nher repulsive. But to certain drunks, the sober man or woman is an\noffense, and Palmer was much more than a drunk. He was a marak addict,\nand in the eyes of the marak fiends, all things and all people were\nwonderful, except those who did not share their taste for the drug. The\nlatter were miserable, depraved creatures, practically subhuman.\n\nOf course that was not the way most of them put it. Certainly it was\nnot the way Palmer did. He regarded his wife, he told himself, as an\nunfortunate individual whom he loved very much, one whom it was his\nduty to make happy. That her new-found happiness would also hasten\nher death was merely an unfortunate coincidence. She was sure to die\nanyway, before long, so why not have her live out her last days in the\npeace and contentment that only marak could bring?\n\nLouise herself would have had an answer to that, if he had ever put the\nquestion to her. He was careful never to do so.\n\nShe laid the book aside and looked up at him again. She said, \"Jim,\ndarling, do you think you could get the television set working again?\"\n\n\"Not without a mesotron rectifier.\"\n\n\"Even the radio would be a comfort.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't do any good, any way. Too much static from both Mars and\nEarth this time of year.\"\n\nThat was the beauty of the marak, he thought. It changed his mood,\nand left him calm and in full command of his faculties, able to handle\nany problem that came up. He himself, of course, missed neither the\nradio nor the television, and he never touched the fine library of\nmicro-books. He didn't need them.\n\nA shadow flitted by outside the thick window, blotting out for a moment\nthe blaze of stars. It was the shadow of death, as he knew, and he was\nable to smile even at that. Even death was wonderful. When it finally\ncame, it would find him happy. He would not shudder away from it, as he\nsaw Louise doing now at the sight of the ominous shadow.\n\nHe smiled at his wife again, remembering the six years they had lived\ntogether. It had been a short married life, but--again the word\nsuggested itself to him--a wonderful one. There had been only one\nquarrel of importance, in the second year, and after that they had got\nalong perfectly. And then, two years ago, he had begun to take marak,\nand after that he couldn't have quarreled with anyone. It was a paragon\namong drugs, and it was one of the mysteries of his existence that\nanybody should object to his using it.\n\nLouise had tried to argue with him after she had found out, but he had\nturned every exchange of views into a peaceful discussion, which from\nhis side, at least, was brimming over with good humor. He had even\nbeen good-humored when she tried to slip the antidote into his food.\nIt was this attitude of his that had so often left her baffled and\nenraged, and he had a good chuckle out of that, too. Imagine a wife\ngetting angry because her husband was too good-natured.\n\nBut she was never going to get angry again. He would see to that. Not\nafter tonight. A big change was going to take place in her life.\n\nShe had picked up another book, and for the moment he pitied her. He\nknew that she wasn't interested in any books. She was merely restless,\nlooking for something to do with herself, seeking some method of\nkilling time before the shadows outside killed it for her for good and\nall. She couldn't understand his being so peaceful and contented, doing\nnothing at all.\n\nShe threw the second book down and snarled--yes, that was the word,\n\"You're such a fool, Jim! You sit there, smug and sure of yourself,\nyour mind blank, just waiting--waiting for them to kill you and me. And\nyou seem actually happy when I mention it.\"\n\n\"I'm happy at anything and everything, dear.\"\n\n\"At the thought of dying too?\"\n\n\"Living or dying--it doesn't make any difference. Whatever happens,\nI'm incapable of being unhappy.\"\n\n\"If it weren't for the drug, we'd both live. You'd think of a way to\nkill them before they killed us.\"\n\n\"There is no way.\"\n\n\"There must be. You just can't think of it while the drug has you in\nits grip.\"\n\n\"The drug doesn't have you, dear.\" He asked without sarcasm, \"Why don't\nyou think of a way?\"\n\n\"Because I lack the training you have. Because I don't have the\nscientific knowledge, and all the equipment scattered around means\nnothing to me.\"\n\n\"There's nothing to be done.\"\n\nHer fists clenched. \"If you weren't under the influence of the drug--\"\n\n\"You know that it doesn't affect the ability to think. Tests have shown\nthat.\"\n\n\"Tests conducted by addicts themselves!\"\n\n\"The fact that they can conduct the tests should be proof enough that\nthere's nothing wrong with their minds.\"\n\n\"But there _is_!\" she shouted. \"I can see it in you. Oh, I know that\nyou can still add and subtract, and you can draw lines under two\nwords which mean the same thing, but that isn't really thinking. Real\nthinking means the ability to tackle real problems--hard problems that\nyou can't handle merely with paper and pencil. It means having the\nincentive to use your brain for a long time at a stretch. And that's\nwhat the drug has ruined. It has taken away all your incentive.\"\n\n\"I still go about my duties.\"\n\n\"Not as well as you used to, and even at that, only because they've\nbecome a habit. Just as you talk to me, because I've become a habit. If\nyou'd let me give you the antidote--\"\n\nHe chuckled at the absurdity of her suggestion. Once an addict had\nbeen cured, he could not become addicted again. The antidote acted\nto produce a permanent immunization against the effects of the drug.\nIt was the realization of this fact that made addicts fight so hard\nagainst any attempt to cure them. And she thought that she could\nconvince him by argument!\n\nHe said, \"_You_ talk of not being able to think!\"\n\n\"I know,\" she replied hotly. \"_I'm_ the one who blunders. _I'm_ the\nfool, for arguing with you, when I realize that it's impossible to\nconvince a marak addict.\"\n\n\"That's it,\" he nodded, and chuckled again. But that wasn't quite it.\nFor he was also chuckling at his plan. She had thought him unable to\ntackle a real problem. Well, he would tackle one tonight. Then she\nwould simply adopt his point of view, and she would no longer be\nunhappy. After she had accepted the solution he had provided, she would\nwonder how she could ever have opposed him.\n\nHe fell into one of his dozes and hardly noticed her glaring at him.\nWhen he came out of it at last, it was to hear her say, \"We have to\nstay alive as long as possible. For the sake of the lighthouse.\"\n\n\"Of course, my dear. I don't dispute that at all.\"\n\n\"And the longer we stay alive, the more chance there is that some ship\nwill pick us up.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, there's no chance at all,\" he asserted cheerfully. \"You know\nthat as well as I do. No use deceiving yourself, my love.\"\n\nThat, he observed to himself, was the way of non-addicts. They couldn't\nlook facts in the face. They had to cling to a blind and silly optimism\nwhich no facts justified.\n\n_He_ knew that there was no hope. _He_ was able to review the facts\ncalmly, judiciously, to see the inevitability of their dying--and to\ntake pleasure even in that.\n\nHe reviewed them for her now. \"Let us see, sweetheart, whether I've\nlost my ability to analyze a situation. We're here with our pretty\nlittle lighthouse in the middle of a group of asteroids between Mars\nand Earth. Ships have been wrecked here, and our task is to prevent\nfurther wrecks. The lighthouse sends out a standard high-frequency\nbeam whose intensity and phase permit astrogators to estimate their\ndistance and direction from us. Ordinarily, there's nothing for us to\ndo. But on the rare occasions when the beam fails--\"\n\n\"That will be the end.\"\n\n\"On those occasions,\" he continued, unruffled by her interruption, \"I\nam supposed to leave my cosy little shelter, so thoughtfully equipped\nwith all the comforts of Earth or Mars, and make repairs as rapidly as\npossible. Under the usual conditions, lighthousekeeping is a boring\ntask. In fact, it has been known to drive people insane. That's why\nit's generally assigned to happily married couples like us, who are\naccustomed to living quietly, without excitement.\"\n\n\"And that,\" she added bitterly, \"is why even happily married couples\nare usually relieved after one year.\"\n\n\"But, darling,\" he said, his tone cheerful, \"you mustn't blame anyone.\nWho would have expected that a maverick meteor would come at us and\ndisplace us from our orbit? And who would have expected that the meteor\nwould have collided first with the outer asteroids, and picked up a\ncargo of--those?\"\n\nHe gestured toward the window, where a shadow had momentarily paused.\nBy the light that shone through, he could see that the creature was\nrelatively harmless-looking. It had what appeared to be a round,\nhumorous face whose unhumorous intentions would be revealed only at\nthe moment of the kill. The seeming face was actually featureless, for\nit was not a face at all. It had neither eyes, nor nose, nor mouth.\nThe effect of features was given by the odd blend of colors. Almost\nescaping notice because of their unusual position and their dull brown\nhue were the stomach fangs, in neat rows which could be extended and\nretracted like those of a snake.\n\nHe noticed that Louise had shuddered again, and said, in the manner\nof a man making conversation, \"Interesting, aren't they? They're rock\nbreathers, you know. They need very little oxygen, and they extract\nthat from the silicates and other oxygen-containing compounds of the\nrock.\"\n\n\"Don't talk about them.\"\n\n\"All right, if you don't want me to. But about us--you see, my dear,\nno one expected us to be lost. And even if the Lighthouse Service has\nstarted to look for us, it'll take a long time to find us.\"\n\n\"We have food, water, air. If not for those beasts, we'd last until a\nrescue ship appeared.\"\n\n\"But even a rescue ship wouldn't be able to reach us unless we kept the\nbeam going. So far, we've been lucky. It's really functioned remarkably\nwell. But sooner or later it'll go out of order, and then I'll have to\ngo out and fix it. You agree to that, don't you, Louise, dear?\"\n\nShe nodded. She said quietly, \"The beam must be kept in order.\"\n\n\"That's when the creatures will get me,\" he said, almost with\nsatisfaction. \"I may kill one or two of them, although the way I feel\ntoward everything, I hate to kill anything at all. But you know,\nsweetheart, that there are more than a dozen of them altogether, and\nit's clumsy shooting in a spacesuit at beasts which move as swiftly as\nthey do.\"\n\n\"And if you don't succeed in fixing what's wrong, if they get you--\"\nShe broke down suddenly and began to cry.\n\nHe looked at her with compassion, and smoothed her hair. And yet, under\nthe influence of the drug, he enjoyed even her crying. It was, as he\nnever tired of repeating to himself and to her a wonderful drug. Under\nits spell, a man--or a woman--could really enjoy life.\n\nTonight she would begin to enjoy life along with him.\n\n\n\nTheir chronometer functioned perfectly, and they still regulated their\nliving habits by it, using Greenwich Earth time. At seven in the\nevening they sat down to a fine meal. Knowing that tomorrow they might\ndie, Louise had decided that tonight they would eat and drink as well\nas they could, and she had selected a Christmas special. She had merely\nto pull a lever, and the food had slid into the oven, to be cooked at\nonce by an intense beam of high-frequency radiation. Jim himself had\nchosen the wine and the brandy--one of the peculiarities of the marak\nwas that it did not affect the actual enjoyment of alcoholic drinks in\nthe slightest, and one of the sights of the Solar System was to see an\naddict who was also drunk.\n\nBut it was a rare sight, for the marak itself created such a pervading\nsensation of well-being that it often acted as a cure for alcoholism.\nOnce an alcoholic had experienced its effect, he had no need to get\ndrunk to forget his troubles. He enjoyed his troubles instead, and\ndrank the alcohol for its own sake, for its ability to provide a\nslightly different sensation, and not for its ability to release him\nfrom an unhappy world.\n\nSo tonight Palmer drank moderately, taking just enough, as it seemed\nto him, to stimulate his brain. And he did what he now realized he\nshould have done long ago. Unobserved, he placed a tablet of marak in\nhis own wineglass and one in Louise's. The slight bitterness of taste\nwould be hardly perceptible. And after that Louise would be an addict\ntoo.\n\nThat was the way the marak worked. There was nothing mysterious about\nthe craving. It was simply that once you had experienced how delightful\nit was, you wouldn't do without it.\n\nThe tablet he had taken that morning was losing its effect, but he felt\nso pleased at what he was doing that he didn't mind even that. For the\nnext half hour he would enjoy himself simply by looking at Louise, and\nthinking that now at last they would be united again, no longer kept\napart by her silly ideas about doing something to save themselves. And\nthen the drug would take effect, and they would feel themselves lifted\nto the stars together, never to come down to this substitute for Earth\nagain until the beam failed, and they went out together to make the\nrepairs, and the shadows closed in on them.\n\nHe had made sure that Louise had her back to him when he dropped the\ntablet into her glass, and he saw that she suspected nothing. She drank\nher wine, he noticed, without even commenting on the taste. He felt a\nsudden impulse to kiss her, and, somewhat to her surprise, he did so.\nThen he sat down again and went on with the dinner.\n\nHe waited.\n\nAn hour later he knew that he had made her happy. She was laughing as\nshe hadn't laughed for a long time. She laughed at the humorous things\nhe said, at the flattering way he raised his glass to her, even at what\nshe saw through the window. Sometimes it seemed to him that she was\nlaughing at nothing at all.\n\nHe tried to think of how he had reacted the first time he had taken\nthe drug. He hadn't been quite so aggressively cheerful, not quite\nso--hysterical. But then, the drug didn't have exactly the same effect\non everyone. She wasn't as well balanced as he had been. The important\nthing was that she was happy.\n\nCuriously enough, he himself wasn't happy at all.\n\nIt took about five seconds for the thought to become clear to him,\nfive seconds in which he passed from dull amazement to an enraged and\nhorrified comprehension. He sprang to his feet, overturning the table\nat which they still sat. And he saw that she wasn't surprised at all,\nthat she still stared at him with a secret satisfaction.\n\n\"You've cured me!\" he cried. \"You've fed me the antidote!\"\n\nAnd he began to curse. He remembered the other time she had tried it,\nthe time when he had been on the alert, and had easily detected the\nstrange metallic taste of the stuff. He had spat it out, and under the\ninfluence of the drug from which she had hoped to save him, he had\nlaughed at her.\n\nNow he was unable to laugh. He had been so intent on feeding the tablet\nto her that he had forgotten to guard himself, and he had been caught.\nHe was normal now--her idea of being normal--and he would never again\nknow the wonderful feeling the drug gave. He began to realize his\nsituation on this horrible lonely asteroid. He cast a glance at the\nwindow and at what must be waiting outside, and it was his turn to\nshudder.\n\nHe noticed that she was still smiling.\n\nHe said bitterly, \"You're the addict now and I'm cured.\"\n\nShe stopped smiling and said quietly, \"Jim, listen to me. You're wrong,\ncompletely wrong. I didn't give you the antidote, and you didn't give\nme the drug.\"\n\n\"I put it in your wineglass myself.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"That was a tablet I substituted for yours. It's\nan anti-virus dose from our medicine chest. You took one of the\nsame things. That's why you feel so depressed. You're not under the\ninfluence of the drug any more.\"\n\nHe took a deep breath. \"But I'm not cured?\"\n\n\"No. I knew that I wouldn't be able to slip you the antidote. The taste\nis too strong. Later you'll be able to start taking the drug again.\nThat is, if you want to, after experiencing for a time what it is to\nbe normal. But not now. You have to keep your head clear. You have to\nthink of something to save us.\"\n\n\"But there's nothing to think of!\" he shouted angrily. \"I told you that\nthe drug doesn't affect the intelligence!\"\n\n\"I still don't believe you. If you'd only exert yourself, use your\nmind--\"\n\nHe said savagely, \"I'm not going to bother. Give me those marak\ntablets.\"\n\nShe backed away from him. \"I thought you might want them. I took no\nchances. I threw them out.\"\n\n\"Out there?\" A horrified and incredulous look was on his face. \"You\nmean that I'm stuck here without them? Louise, you fool, there's no\nhelp for us! The other way, at least, we'd have died happy. But now--\"\n\nHe stared out the window. The shadows were there in full force. Not\none now, but two, three--he counted half a dozen. It was almost as if\nthey knew that the end had come.\n\nThey had reason to be happy, he thought with despair. And perhaps--\nhe shrank back from the thought, but it forced itself into his\nmind--perhaps, now that all happiness had gone, and wretchedness had\ntaken its place, he might as well end everything. There would be no\ndays to spend torturing himself in anticipation of a horrible death.\n\nLouise exclaimed suddenly, \"Jim, _look_! They're _frolicking_!\"\n\nHe looked. The beasts certainly were gay. One of them leaped from\nthe airless surface of the asteroid and sailed over its fellow. He\nhad never seen them do that before. Usually they clung to the rocky\nsurface. Another was spinning around oddly, as if it had lost its sense\nof balance.\n\nLouise said, \"_They've_ swallowed the tablets! Over a hundred\ndoses--enough to drug every beast on the asteroid!\"\n\nFor a moment Palmer stared at the gamboling alien drug addicts. Then\nhe put on his spacesuit and took his gun, and, without the slightest\ndanger to himself, went out and shot them one by one. He noted, with a\nkind of grim envy, that they died happy.",
