    "body": "\nTHE CASTAWAY\n\nMrs. John Boxer stood at the door of the shop with her hands clasped on\nher apron.  The short day had drawn to a close, and the lamps in the\nnarrow little thorough-fares of Shinglesea were already lit.  For a time\nshe stood listening to the regular beat of the sea on the beach some\nhalf-mile distant, and then with a slight shiver stepped back into the\nshop and closed the door.\n\nThe little shop with its wide-mouthed bottles of sweets was one of her\nearliest memories.  Until her marriage she had known no other home, and\nwhen her husband was lost with the _North Star_ some three years before,\nshe gave up her home in Poplar and returned to assist her mother in the\nlittle shop.\n\nIn a restless mood she took up a piece of needle-work, and a minute or\ntwo later put it down again.  A glance through the glass of the door\nleading into the small parlour revealed Mrs. Gimpson, with a red shawl\nround her shoulders, asleep in her easy-chair.\n\nMrs. Boxer turned at the clang of the shop bell, and then, with a wild\ncry, stood gazing at the figure of a man standing in the door-way.  He\nwas short and bearded, with oddly shaped shoulders, and a left leg which\nwas not a match; but the next moment Mrs. Boxer was in his arms sobbing\nand laughing together.\n\nMrs. Gimpson, whose nerves were still quivering owing to the suddenness\nwith which she had been awakened, came into the shop; Mr. Boxer freed an\narm, and placing it round her waist kissed her with some affection on the\nchin.\n\n\"He's come back!\"  cried Mrs. Boxer, hysterically.\n\n\"Thank goodness,\" said Mrs. Gimpson, after a moment's deliberation.\n\n\"He's alive!\"  cried Mrs. Boxer.  \"He's alive !\"\n\nShe half-dragged and half-led him into the small parlour, and thrusting\nhim into the easy-chair lately vacated by Mrs. Gimpson seated herself\nupon his knee, regardless in her excitement that the rightful owner was\nwith elaborate care selecting the most uncomfortable chair in the room.\n\n\"Fancy his coming back!\" said Mrs. Boxer, wiping her eyes.  \"How did you\nescape, John?  Where have you been?  Tell us all about it.\"\n\nMr. Boxer sighed.  \"It 'ud be a long story if I had the gift of telling\nof it,\" he said, slowly, \"but I'll cut it short for the present.  When\nthe _North Star_ went down in the South Pacific most o' the hands got\naway in the boats, but I was too late.  I got this crack on the head with\nsomething falling on it from aloft.  Look here.\"\n\nHe bent his head, and Mrs. Boxer, separating the stubble with her\nfingers, uttered an exclamation of pity and alarm at the extent of the\nscar; Mrs. Gimpson, craning forward, uttered a sound which might mean\nanything--even pity.\n\n\"When I come to my senses,\" continued Mr. Boxer, \"the ship was sinking,\nand I just got to my feet when she went down and took me with her.  How I\nescaped I don't know.  I seemed to be choking and fighting for my breath\nfor years, and then I found myself floating on the sea and clinging to a\ngrating.  I clung to it all night, and next day I was picked up by a\nnative who was paddling about in a canoe, and taken ashore to an island,\nwhere I lived for over two years.  It was right out o' the way o' craft,\nbut at last I was picked up by a trading schooner named the _Pearl,_\nbelonging to Sydney, and taken there.  At Sydney I shipped aboard the\n_Marston Towers,_ a steamer, and landed at the Albert Docks this\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Poor John,\" said his wife, holding on to his arm.  \"How you must have\nsuffered!\"\n\n\"I did,\" said Mr. Boxer.  \"Mother got a cold?\"  he inquired, eying that\nlady.\n\n\"No, I ain't,\" said Mrs. Gimpson, answering for herself.  \"Why didn't you\nwrite when you got to Sydney?\"\n\n\"Didn't know where to write to,\" replied Mr. Boxer, staring.  \"I didn't\nknow where Mary had gone to.\"\n\n\"You might ha' wrote here,\" said Mrs. Gimpson.\n\n\"Didn't think of it at the time,\" said Mr. Boxer.  \"One thing is, I was\nvery busy at Sydney, looking for a ship.  However, I'm 'ere now.\"\n\n\"I always felt you'd turn up some day,\" said Mrs. Gimpson.  \"I felt\ncertain of it in my own mind.  Mary made sure you was dead, but I said\n'no, I knew better.'\"\n\nThere was something in Mrs. Gimpson's manner of saying this that\nimpressed her listeners unfavourably.  The impression was deepened when,\nafter a short, dry laugh _a propos_ of nothing, she sniffed again--three\ntimes.\n\n\"Well, you turned out to be right,\" said Mr. Boxer, shortly.\n\n\"I gin'rally am,\" was the reply; \"there's very few people can take me\nin.\"\n\nShe sniffed again.\n\n\"Were the natives kind to you?\" inquired Mrs. Boxer, hastily, as she\nturned to her husband.\n\n\"Very kind,\" said the latter.  \"Ah! you ought to have seen that island.\nBeautiful yellow sands and palm-trees; cocoa-nuts to be 'ad for the\npicking, and nothing to do all day but lay about in the sun and swim in\nthe sea.\"\n\n\"Any public-'ouses there?\" inquired Mrs. Gimpson.\n\n\"Cert'nly not,\" said her son-in-law.  \"This was an island--one o' the\nlittle islands in the South Pacific Ocean.\"\n\n\"What did you say the name o' the schooner was?\"  inquired Mrs. Gimpson.\n\n\"_Pearl,_\" replied Mr. Boxer, with the air of a resentful witness under\ncross-examination.\n\n\"And what was the name o' the captin?\"  said Mrs. Gimpson.\n\n\"Thomas--Henery--Walter--Smith,\" said Mr. Boxer, with somewhat unpleasant\nemphasis.\n\n\"An' the mate's name?\"\n\n\"John Brown,\" was the reply.\n\n\"Common names,\" commented Mrs. Gimpson, \"very common.  But I knew you'd\ncome back all right--I never 'ad no alarm.  'He's safe and happy, my\ndear,' I says.  'He'll come back all in his own good time.'\"\n\n\"What d'you mean by that?\" demanded the sensitive Mr. Boxer.  \"I come\nback as soon as I could.\"\n\n\"You know you were anxious, mother,\" interposed her daughter.  \"Why, you\ninsisted upon our going to see old Mr. Silver about it.\"\n\n\"Ah!  but I wasn't uneasy or anxious afterwards,\" said Mrs. Gimpson,\ncompressing her lips.\n\n\"Who's old Mr. Silver, and what should he know about it?\" inquired Mr.\nBoxer.\n\n\"He's a fortune-teller,\" replied his wife.  \"Reads the stars,\" said his\nmother-in-law.\n\nMr. Boxer laughed--a good ringing laugh.  \"What did he tell you?\" he\ninquired.  \"Nothing,\" said his wife, hastily.  \"Ah!\" said Mr. Boxer,\nwaggishly, \"that was wise of 'im.  Most of us could tell fortunes that\nway.\"\n\n\"That's wrong,\" said Mrs. Gimpson to her daughter, sharply.  \"Right's\nright any day, and truth's truth.  He said that he knew all about John\nand what he'd been doing, but he wouldn't tell us for fear of 'urting our\nfeelings and making mischief.\"\n\n\"Here, look 'ere,\" said Mr. Boxer, starting up; \"I've 'ad about enough o'\nthis.  Why don't you speak out what you mean?  I'll mischief 'im, the old\nhumbug.  Old rascal.\"\n\n\"Never mind, John,\" said his wife, laying her hand upon his arm.  \"Here\nyou are safe and sound, and as for old Mr. Silver, there's a lot o'\npeople don't believe in him.\"\n\n\"Ah! they don't want to,\" said Mrs. Gimpson, obstinately.  \"But don't\nforget that he foretold my cough last winter.\"\n\n\"Well, look 'ere,\" said Mr. Boxer, twisting his short, blunt nose into as\nnear an imitation of a sneer as he could manage, \"I've told you my story\nand I've got witnesses to prove it.  You can write to the master of the\nMarston Towers if you like, and other people besides.  Very well, then;\nlet's go and see your precious old fortune-teller.  You needn't say who I\nam; say I'm a friend, and tell 'im never to mind about making mischief,\nbut to say right out where I am and what I've been doing all this time.\nI have my 'opes it'll cure you of your superstitiousness.\"\n\n\"We'll go round after we've shut up, mother,\" said Mrs. Boxer.  \"We'll\nhave a bit o' supper first and then start early.\"\n\nMrs. Gimpson hesitated.  It is never pleasant to submit one's\nsuperstitions to the tests of the unbelieving, but after the attitude she\nhad taken up she was extremely loath to allow her son-in-law a triumph.\n\n\"Never mind, we'll say no more about it,\" she said, primly, \"but I 'ave\nmy own ideas.\"\n\n\"I dessay,\" said Mr. Boxer; \"but you're afraid for us to go to your old\nfortune-teller.  It would be too much of a show-up for 'im.\"\n\n\"It's no good your trying to aggravate me, John Boxer, because you can't\ndo it,\" said Mrs. Gimpson, in a voice trembling with passion.\n\n\"O' course, if people like being deceived they must be,\" said Mr. Boxer;\n\"we've all got to live, and if we'd all got our common sense fortune-\ntellers couldn't.  Does he tell fortunes by tea-leaves or by the colour\nof your eyes?\"\n\n\"Laugh away, John Boxer,\" said Mrs. Gimpson, icily; \"but I shouldn't have\nbeen alive now if it hadn't ha' been for Mr. Silver's warnings.\"\n\n\"Mother stayed in bed for the first ten days in July,\" explained Mrs.\nBoxer, \"to avoid being bit by a mad dog.\"\n\n\"Tchee--tchee--tchee,\" said the hapless Mr. Boxer, putting his hand over\nhis mouth and making noble efforts to restrain himself; \"tchee--tch\n\n\"I s'pose you'd ha' laughed more if I 'ad been bit?\"  said the glaring\nMrs. Gimpson.\n\n\"Well, who did the dog bite after all?\"  inquired Mr. Boxer, recovering.\n\n\"You don't understand,\" replied Mrs. Gimpson, pityingly; \"me being safe\nup in bed and the door locked, there was no mad dog.  There was no use\nfor it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Boxer, \"me and Mary's going round to see that old\ndeceiver after supper, whether you come or not.  Mary shall tell 'im I'm\na friend, and ask him to tell her everything about 'er husband.  Nobody\nknows me here, and Mary and me'll be affectionate like, and give 'im to\nunderstand we want to marry.  Then he won't mind making mischief.\"\n\n\"You'd better leave well alone,\" said Mrs. Gimpson.\n\nMr. Boxer shook his head.  \"I was always one for a bit o' fun,\" he said,\nslowly.  \"I want to see his face when he finds out who I am.\"\n\nMrs. Gimpson made no reply; she was looking round for the market-basket,\nand having found it she left the reunited couple to keep house while she\nwent out to obtain a supper which should, in her daughter's eyes, be\nworthy of the occasion.\n\nShe went to the High Street first and made her purchases, and was on the\nway back again when, in response to a sudden impulse, as she passed the\nend of Crowner's Alley, she turned into that small by-way and knocked at\nthe astrologer's door.\n\nA slow, dragging footstep was heard approaching in reply to the summons,\nand the astrologer, recognising his visitor as one of his most faithful\nand credulous clients, invited her to step inside.  Mrs. Gimpson\ncomplied, and, taking a chair, gazed at the venerable white beard and\nsmall, red-rimmed eyes of her host in some perplexity as to how to begin.\n\n\"My daughter's coming round to see you presently,\" she said, at last.\n\nThe astrologer nodded.\n\n\"She--she wants to ask you about 'er husband,\" faltered' Mrs. Gimpson;\n\"she's going to bring a friend with her--a man who doesn't believe in\nyour knowledge.  He--he knows all about my daughter's husband, and he\nwants to see what you say you know about him.\"\n\nThe old man put on a pair of huge horn spectacles and eyed her carefully.\n\n\"You've got something on your mind,\" he said, at last; \"you'd better tell\nme everything.\"\n\nMrs. Gimpson shook her head.\n\n\"There's some danger hanging over you,\" continued Mr. Silver, in a low,\nthrilling voice; \"some danger in connection with your son-in-law.  There\"\nhe waved a lean, shrivelled hand backward and for-ward as though\ndispelling a fog, and peered into distance--\"there is something forming\nover you.  You--or somebody--are hiding something from me.\"\n\nMrs. Gimpson, aghast at such omniscience, sank backward in her chair.\n\n\"Speak,\" said the old man, gently; \"there is no reason why you should be\nsacrificed for others.\"\n\nMrs. Gimpson was of the same opinion, and in some haste she reeled off\nthe events of the evening.  She had a good memory, and no detail was\nlost.\n\n\"Strange, strange,\" said the venerable Mr. Silver, when he had finished.\n\"He is an ingenious man.\"\n\n\"Isn't it true?\"  inquired his listener.  \"He says he can prove it.  And\nhe is going to find out what you meant by saying you were afraid of\nmaking mischief.\"\n\n\"He can prove some of it,\" said the old man, his eyes snapping\nspitefully.  \"I can guarantee that.\"\n\n\"But it wouldn't have made mischief if you had told us that,\" ventured\nMrs. Gimpson.  \"A man can't help being cast away.\"\n\n\"True,\" said the astrologer, slowly; \"true.  But let them come and\nquestion me; and whatever you do, for your own sake don't let a soul know\nthat you have been here.  If you do, the danger to yourself will be so\nterrible that even I may be unable to help you.\"\n\nMrs. Gimpson shivered, and more than ever impressed by his marvellous\npowers made her way slowly home, where she found the unconscious Mr.\nBoxer relating his adventures again with much gusto to a married couple\nfrom next door.\n\n\"It's a wonder he's alive,\" said Mr. Jem Thompson, looking up as the old\nwoman entered the room; \"it sounds like a story-book.  Show us that cut\non your head again, mate.\"\n\nThe obliging Mr. Boxer complied.\n\n\"We're going on with 'em after they've 'ad sup-per,\" continued Mr.\nThompson, as he and his wife rose to depart.  \"It'll be a fair treat to\nme to see old Silver bowled out.\"\n\nMrs. Gimpson sniffed and eyed his retreating figure disparagingly; Mrs.\nBoxer, prompted by her husband, began to set the table for supper.\n\nIt was a lengthy meal, owing principally to Mr. Boxer, but it was over at\nlast, and after that gentleman had assisted in shutting up the shop they\njoined the Thompsons, who were waiting outside, and set off for Crowner's\nAlley.  The way was enlivened by Mr. Boxer, who had thrills of horror\nevery ten yards at the idea of the supernatural things he was about to\nwitness, and by Mr. Thompson, who, not to be outdone, persisted in\nstanding stock-still at frequent intervals until he had received the\nassurances of his giggling better-half that he would not be made to\nvanish in a cloud of smoke.\n\nBy the time they reached Mr. Silver's abode the party had regained its\ndecorum, and, except for a tremendous shudder on the part of Mr. Boxer as\nhis gaze fell on a couple of skulls which decorated the magician's table,\ntheir behaviour left nothing to be desired.  Mrs. Gimpson, in a few\nawkward words, announced the occasion of their visit.  Mr. Boxer she\nintroduced as a friend of the family from London.\n\n\"I will do what I can,\" said the old man, slowly, as his visitors seated\nthemselves, \"but I can only tell you what I see.  If I do not see all, or\nsee clearly, it cannot be helped.\"\n\nMr. Boxer winked at Mr. Thompson, and received an understanding pinch in\nreturn; Mrs. Thompson in a hot whisper told them to behave themselves.\n\nThe mystic preparations were soon complete.  A little cloud of smoke,\nthrough which the fierce red eyes of the astrologer peered keenly at Mr.\nBoxer, rose from the table.  Then he poured various liquids into a small\nchina bowl and, holding up his hand to command silence, gazed steadfastly\ninto it.  \"I see pictures,\" he announced, in a deep voice.  \"The docks of\na great city; London.  I see an ill-shaped man with a bent left leg\nstanding on the deck of a ship.\"\n\nMr. Thompson, his eyes wide open with surprise, jerked Mr. Boxer in the\nribs, but Mr. Boxer, whose figure was a sore point with him, made no\nresponse.\n\n\"The ship leaves the docks,\" continued Mr. Silver, still peering into the\nbowl.  \"As she passes through the entrance her stern comes into view with\nthe name painted on it.  The--the--the----\"\n\n\"Look agin, old chap,\" growled Mr. Boxer, in an undertone.\n\n\"The North Star,\" said the astrologer.  \"The ill-shaped man is still\nstanding on the fore-part of the ship; I do not know his name or who he\nis.  He takes the portrait of a beautiful young woman from his pocket and\ngazes at it earnestly.\"\n\nMrs. Boxer, who had no illusions on the subject of her personal\nappearance, sat up as though she had been stung; Mr. Thompson, who was\nabout to nudge Mr. Boxer in the ribs again, thought better of it and\nassumed an air of uncompromising virtue.\n\n\"The picture disappears,\" said Mr. Silver.  \"Ah!  I see; I see.  A ship\nin a gale at sea.  It is the North Star; it is sinking.  The ill-shaped\nman sheds tears and loses his head.  I cannot discover the name of this\nman.\"\n\nMr. Boxer, who had been several times on the point of interrupting,\ncleared his throat and endeavoured to look unconcerned.\n\n\"The ship sinks,\" continued the astrologer, in thrilling tones.  \"Ah!\nwhat is this?  a piece of wreck-age with a monkey clinging to it?  No,\nno-o.  The ill-shaped man again.  Dear me!\"\n\nHis listeners sat spellbound.  Only the laboured and intense breathing of\nMr. Boxer broke the silence.\n\n\"He is alone on the boundless sea,\" pursued the seer; \"night falls.  Day\nbreaks, and a canoe propelled by a slender and pretty but dusky maiden\napproaches the castaway.  She assists him into the canoe and his head\nsinks on her lap, as with vigorous strokes of her paddle she propels the\ncanoe toward a small island fringed with palm trees.\"\n\n\"Here, look 'ere--\" began the overwrought Mr. Boxer.\n\n\"H'sh, h'sh!\"  ejaculated the keenly interested Mr. Thompson.  \"W'y don't\nyou keep quiet?\"\n\n\"The picture fades,\" continued the old man.  \"I see another: a native\nwedding.  It is the dusky maiden and the man she rescued.  Ah! the\nwedding is interrupted; a young man, a native, breaks into the group.  He\nhas a long knife in his hand.  He springs upon the ill-shaped man and\nwounds him in the head.\"\n\nInvoluntarily Mr. Boxer's hand went up to his honourable scar, and the\nheads of the others swung round to gaze at it.  Mrs. Boxer's face was\nterrible in its expression, but Mrs. Gimpson's bore the look of sad and\npatient triumph of one who knew men and could not be surprised at\nanything they do.\n\n\"The scene vanishes,\" resumed the monotonous voice, \"and another one\nforms.  The same man stands on the deck of a small ship.  The name on\nthe stern is the Peer--no, Paris--no, no, no, Pearl. It fades from the\nshore where the dusky maiden stands with hands stretched out\nimploringly.  The ill-shaped man smiles and takes the portrait of the\nyoung and beautiful girl from his pocket.\"\n\n\"Look 'ere,\" said the infuriated Mr. Boxer, \"I think we've 'ad about\nenough of this rubbish.  I have--more than enough.\"\n\n\"I don't wonder at it,\" said his wife, trembling furiously.  \"You can go\nif you like.  I'm going to stay and hear all that there is to hear.\"\n\n\"You sit quiet,\" urged the intensely interested Mr. Thompson.  \"He ain't\nsaid it's you.  There's more than one misshaped man in the world, I\ns'pose?\"\n\n\"I see an ocean liner,\" said the seer, who had appeared to be in a trance\nstate during this colloquy.  \"She is sailing for England from Australia.\nI see the name distinctly: the _Marston Towers_.  The same man is on\nboard of her.  The ship arrives at London.  The scene closes; another one\nforms.  The ill-shaped man is sitting with a woman with a beautiful face\n--not the same as the photograph.\"\n\n\"What they can see in him I can't think,\" muttered Mr. Thompson, in an\nenvious whisper.  \"He's a perfick terror, and to look at him----\"\n\n\"They sit hand in hand,\" continued the astrologer, raising his voice.\n\"She smiles up at him and gently strokes his head; he----\"\n\nA loud smack rang through the room and startled the entire company; Mrs.\nBoxer, unable to contain herself any longer, had, so far from profiting\nby the example, gone to the other extreme and slapped her husband's head\nwith hearty good-will.  Mr. Boxer sprang raging to his feet, and in the\nconfusion which ensued the fortune-teller, to the great regret of Mr.\nThompson, upset the contents of the magic bowl.\n\n\"I can see no more,\" he said, sinking hastily into his chair behind the\ntable as Mr. Boxer advanced upon him.\n\nMrs. Gimpson pushed her son-in-law aside, and laying a modest fee upon\nthe table took her daughter's arm and led her out.  The Thompsons\nfollowed, and Mr. Boxer, after an irresolute glance in the direction of\nthe ingenuous Mr. Silver, made his way after them and fell into the rear.\nThe people in front walked on for some time in silence, and then the\nvoice of the greatly impressed Mrs. Thompson was heard, to the effect\nthat if there were only more fortune-tellers in the world there would be\na lot more better men.\n\nMr. Boxer trotted up to his wife's side.  \"Look here, Mary,\" he began.\n\n\"Don't you speak to me,\" said his wife, drawing closer to her mother,\n\"because I won't answer you.\"\n\nMr. Boxer laughed, bitterly.  \"This is a nice home-coming,\" he remarked.\n\nHe fell to the rear again and walked along raging, his temper by no means\nbeing improved by observing that Mrs. Thompson, doubtless with a firm\nbelief in the saying that \"Evil communications corrupt good manners,\"\nkept a tight hold of her husband's arm.  His position as an outcast was\nclearly defined, and he ground his teeth with rage as he observed the\nvirtuous uprightness of Mrs. Gimpson's back.  By the time they reached\nhome he was in a spirit of mad recklessness far in advance of the\ncharacter given him by the astrologer.\n\nHis wife gazed at him with a look of such strong interrogation as he was\nabout to follow her into the house that he paused with his foot on the\nstep and eyed her dumbly.\n\n\"Have you left anything inside that you want?\" she inquired.\n\nMr. Boxer shook his head.  \"I only wanted to come in and make a clean\nbreast of it,\" he said, in a curious voice; \"then I'll go.\"\n\nMrs. Gimpson stood aside to let him pass, and Mr. Thompson, not to be\ndenied, followed close behind with his faintly protesting wife.  They sat\ndown in a row against the wall, and Mr. Boxer, sitting opposite in a\nhang-dog fashion, eyed them with scornful wrath.\n\n\"Well?\"  said Mrs. Boxer, at last.\n\n\"All that he said was quite true,\" said her husband, defiantly.  \"The\nonly thing is, he didn't tell the arf of it.  Altogether, I married three\ndusky maidens.\"\n\nEverybody but Mr. Thompson shuddered with horror.\n\n\"Then I married a white girl in Australia,\" pursued Mr. Boxer, musingly.\n\"I wonder old Silver didn't see that in the bowl; not arf a fortune-\nteller, I call 'im.\"\n\n\"What they see in 'im!\" whispered the astounded Mr. Thompson to his wife.\n\n\"And did you marry the beautiful girl in the photograph?\" demanded Mrs.\nBoxer, in trembling accents.\n\n\"I did,\" said her husband.\n\n\"Hussy,\" cried Mrs. Boxer.\n\n\"I married her,\" said Mr. Boxer, considering--\"I married her at\nCamberwell, in eighteen ninety-three.\"\n\n\"Eighteen ninety-three!\" said his wife, in a startled voice.  \"But you\ncouldn't.  Why, you didn't marry me till eighteen ninety-four.\"\n\n\"What's that got to do with it?\" inquired the monster, calmly.\n\nMrs. Boxer, pale as ashes, rose from her seat and stood gazing at him\nwith horror-struck eyes, trying in vain to speak.\n\n\"You villain!\" cried Mrs. Gimpson, violently.  \"I always distrusted you.\"\n\n\"I know you did,\" said Mr. Boxer, calmly.  \"You've been committing\nbigamy,\" cried Mrs. Gimpson.\n\n\"Over and over agin,\" assented Mr. Boxer, cheerfully.  \"It's got to be a\n'obby with me.\"\n\n\"Was the first wife alive when you married my daughter?\" demanded Mrs.\nGimpson.\n\n\"Alive?\" said Mr. Boxer.  \"O' course she was.  She's alive now--bless\nher.\"\n\nHe leaned back in his chair and regarded with intense satisfaction the\nhorrified faces of the group in front.\n\n\"You--you'll go to jail for this,\" cried Mrs. Gimpson, breathlessly.\n\"What is your first wife's address?\"\n\n\"I decline to answer that question,\" said her son-in-law.\n\n\"What is your first wife's address?\"  repeated Mrs. Gimpson.\n\n\"Ask the fortune-teller,\" said Mr. Boxer, with an aggravating smile.\n\"And then get 'im up in the box as a witness, little bowl and all.  He\ncan tell you more than I can.\"\n\n\"I demand to know her name and address,\" cried Mrs. Gimpson, putting a\nbony arm around the waist of the trembling Mrs. Boxer.\n\n\"I decline to give it,\" said Mr. Boxer, with great relish.  \"It ain't\nlikely I'm going to give myself away like that; besides, it's agin the\nlaw for a man to criminate himself.  You go on and start your bigamy\ncase, and call old red-eyes as a witness.\"\n\nMrs. Gimpson gazed at him in speechless wrath and then stooping down\nconversed in excited whispers with Mrs. Thompson.  Mrs. Boxer crossed\nover to her husband.\n\n\"Oh, John,\" she wailed, \"say it isn't true, say it isn't true.\"\n\nMr. Boxer hesitated.  \"What's the good o' me saying anything?\"  he said,\ndoggedly.\n\n\"It isn't true,\" persisted his wife.  \"Say it isn't true.\"\n\n\"What I told you when I first came in this evening was quite true,\" said\nher husband, slowly.  \"And what I've just told you is as true as what\nthat lying old fortune-teller told you.  You can please yourself what you\nbelieve.\"\n\n\"I believe you, John,\" said his wife, humbly.\n\nMr. Boxer's countenance cleared and he drew her on to his knee.\n\n\"That's right,\" he said, cheerfully.  \"So long as you believe in me I\ndon't care what other people think.  And before I'm much older I'll find\nout how that old rascal got to know the names of the ships I was aboard.\nSeems to me somebody's been talking.\"",
