    "body": "SCENE\n\n    The front room of MR. WILSON\u2019S store used for fitting\n    shoes. A long table piled with boxes is down stage L, a\n    small table with cash box, books, paper and cord down\n    stage R, a couple of chairs and foot rests at C, doors\n    at R and L. MR. WILSON is discovered leaning against\n    table at R while JACK is straddling a chair.\n\n  MR. WILSON: It\u2019s been a whole week, Jack, since you first\n    came into the store, so if you\u2019ve been keeping your\n    ears and eyes open, you will have caught on to some of\n    my methods.\n\n  JACK: Take it from me, dad, I have. They are in a class\n    by themselves. Summed up briefly, as the minister says,\n    they are [_checks each point on fingers_]: Firstly,\n    soak a customer for all she\u2019s worth, or you think she\u2019s\n    worth. Secondly, if a shoe is too expensive, take off\n    a _cent or two_. Thirdly, if it is too cheap, which\n    doesn\u2019t happen very often, take it to the rear where\n    you change the _price_ but not the _shoe_, bring it\n    back and tuck on a _dollar or two_. Fourthly, always\n    side in with everything a customer says, even if she\n    insists that the moon is made of green cheese. Fifthly,\n    always, always,\u2014oh, what does my thumb say, dad? I\u2019ve\n    run out.\n\n  MR. WILSON: Never fail to make a sale, that\u2019s what it\n    says.\n\n  JACK: That\u2019s it. I knew it was something like that. Do\n    you want me to start on the other hand, now?\n\n  MR. WILSON: No, that will do to begin with. I\u2019m glad\n    you\u2019ve been keeping your ears and eyes open so well.\n    Now, I hope you use your tongue to as good advantage.\n    Since the only way to learn the shoe business is to\n    stand firmly on your own feet, I\u2019m going to let you\n    get your first experience this afternoon in waiting on\n    customers, by yourself. I will not interfere unless I\n    see that you are going to lose a sale.\n\n  JACK [_kicking over footrest_]: Lose a sale? Not on your\n    life! Just see me put it all over the dears until\n    they\u2019ll be tumbling over each other to buy. Leave it\n    to your Uncle Dudley. [_Fixes footrest and resumes\n    former position._]\n\n  MR. WILSON: Don\u2019t be so sure, young man. There\u2019s many\n    a spill between the dollar and till and women are\n    pernickety things to handle at any time. [_Bell\n    tinkles._] Here comes your first customer. Good luck.\n    [_Exit door L._]\n\n  JACK [_cranes neck towards door R._]: If it isn\u2019t\n    Betty Moffat, the dearest thing in boots. [_Jumps up\n    hastily, overturning chair._] I\u2019m going to sell her the\n    peachiest shoes in the whole establishment, the little\n    queen!\n\n_Enter BETTY door R._\n\n  BETTY: Why Jack, are _you_ here? I didn\u2019t even know you\n    had started to work.\n\n  JACK [_replaces chair_]: Well, I like that! I\u2019d like you\n    to know that I have worked more or less all my young\n    life.\n\n  BETTY: Principally less. I\u2019d imagine.\n\n  JACK [_hits his head_]: Did you say this was a slammy\n    day? Well, I have started to work in earnest this\n    afternoon for dad has given me the job of waiting on\n    all the customers and you\u2019re the first.\n\n  BETTY: Am I really? I\u2019m so glad.\n\n  JACK: The pleasure is all mine and\u2014the shelling out all\n    yours. [_Draws himself up pompously._] And what can I\n    do for you, madam?\n\n  BETTY [_giggles_]: Oh Jack, you\u2019re too funny for words.\n    I want to buy a pair of dancing slippers. Have you any\n    nice ones?\n\n  JACK: It\u2019s a mighty good thing you asked for the nice\n    ones because we\u2019re out of the other kind. Then you\u2019re\n    going to the dance tonight? Save me a dozen or two,\n    won\u2019t you?\n\n  BETTY [_leans parasol against table R. It falls down and\n    both collide in picking it up_]: Oh, look at my hat!\n    It\u2019s all crooked. [_Fixes it._] Is it on straight now?\n\n  JACK: No, it\u2019s tilted a little to the left side.\n\n  BETTY: Then it _is_ on straight. [_Takes mirror from\n    vanity bag and tilts hat farther._] There, it\u2019s all\n    right now.\n\n  JACK [_aside_]: I never knew that crooked meant straight\n    before, but one is always learning. [_Aloud._] You\n    didn\u2019t say whether you\u2019d save me those dances.\n\n  BETTY [_coquettishly_]: I may save you one or two, I\u2019ll\n    think about it.\n\n  JACK: Put your whole mind to it, then. Now just take this\n    chair. I\u2019m the doctor. And what size do you take?\n\n  BETTY: Two\u2019s and a half.\n\n  JACK: By jove, but you have mighty dainty little feet!\n\n  BETTY [_pleased_]: Do you think so?\n\n  JACK: I don\u2019t think, I know. It will be no feat to fit\n    them. [_Takes a box from table and brings it over._]\n    Here is just the very thing you want. [_Takes out\n    slippers._] Aren\u2019t they classy? Let me try one on.\n\n  BETTY [_kicks off pump_]: They are rather nice, aren\u2019t\n    they? [_Puts foot on footrest. Jack tries to put\n    slipper on, but fails._]\n\n  JACK: These are too small, Betty. You\u2019ll need a half size\n    larger. [_He starts to go towards table L._]\n\n  BETTY [_indignantly_]: They\u2019re not a bit too small. I\n    never take a larger size than that. [_Jerks slipper\n    on._] There, you see _I_ can get it on. I think you\u2019re\n    real mean, trying to make out that I have big feet.\n\n  JACK: Upon my soul. [_Hits sole of boot._] Betty, I\u2019m not\n    doing anything of the kind. You have the dearest little\n    feet I have ever seen, but you can see for yourself\n    that that slipper is too tight. I\u2019d hate to have you\n    get a horrid corn for somebody to trample on and\u2014\n\n  BETTY [_jumps up angrily_]: The very idea! There\u2019s only\n    one boy I\u2019ve danced with who\u2019s ever trampled on my feet\n    and you\u2019re not going to get the chance tonight, so\n    there! [_Stamps foot with slipper on, grimaces and hops\n    on one foot._] Ouch!\n\n  JACK: What\u2019s the matter?\n\n  BETTY: I\u2014I\u2014oh, I turned on my ankle. It\u2019s weak you know.\n\n  JACK: It wasn\u2019t the slipper\u2019s fault, was it?\n\n  BETTY [_indignantly_]: Of course it wasn\u2019t; the very\n    idea, as though it could hurt anything. [_Goes behind\n    his back, takes off slipper and rubs her toes._]\n\n  JACK: But that slam you gave me, you didn\u2019t mean what you\n    said, did you?\n\n  BETTY: What about?\n\n  JACK: Why, my dancing, and\u2014\n\n  BETTY: I do, I mean every word of it.\n\n  JACK: Well. I\u2019m sorry, Betty, if I have offended you.\n    Take these if you want to. All I can say is that I\u2019d\n    hate to have to stand in your shoes.\n\n  BETTY: I tell you they\u2019re _not_ too small, _they\u2019re not,\n    they\u2019re not, they\u2019re not_! But I\u2019ll not take them nor\n    any other either. [_Sits down, takes off slipper and\n    puts on her own._] You can keep your old slippers.\n\n_Enter MR. WILSON from door L._\n\n  MR. WILSON: You\u2019ll have to make allowance for this new\n    clerk of mine, Miss Moffat. You see you\u2019re his first\n    customer so he\u2019s pretty green at the business. Let me\n    try this slipper on. [_Picks it up._] Jack, did you use\n    a shoe horn?\n\n  JACK [_sulkily_]: No, I didn\u2019t. Should you?\n\n  MR. WILSON: Of course. No wonder you had trouble putting\n    it on. [_Puts it on her foot._] There, it fits\n    perfectly, Miss Moffat. You have such pretty feet, it\u2019s\n    a pleasure to fit them.\n\n  BETTY: I\u2019m glad _you_ think so, Mr. Wilson. I\u2019ll take\n    them. How much are they?\n\n  MR. WILSON: They\u2019re twelve dollars, Miss Moffat, but\n    seeing that you\u2019ve had so much annoyance with our new\n    clerk, I\u2019m going to let you have them for eleven,\n    ninety-five. [_Wraps them up._]\n\n  BETTY [_gathering parasol, purse, etc._]: Thank you, Mr.\n    Wilson. Charge them to dad. [_Takes parcel and goes\n    towards door R._] Good-bye.\n\n  JACK [_rushes to open door_]: Good-bye, Betty. I\u2019ll see\n    you at the dance.\n\n  BETTY [_haughtily_]: _You\u2019ll_ not fail to see my big\n    feet, at any rate, Mr. Wilson. [_Exit._]\n\n  JACK [_sinks into chair_]: The dearest thing in boots!\n    And now I\u2019ve made her so mad that she\u2019ll never speak\n    to me again. All over a measely half-size in slippers.\n    Who\u2019d think a girl could be so silly!\n\n  MR. WILSON: Eight women out of ten want boots too small\n    for them and won\u2019t take anything else. That\u2019s why women\n    can endure pain better than men; they get used to it,\n    breaking in tight shoes.\n\n  JACK: The Chinese have nothing on them, believe me!\n    [_Shakes finger at father._] And you old fraud you,\n    you side in with them and then later on sell them corn\n    plasters and bunion-easers and arch-supports and all\n    the rest of the instruments of torture.\n\n  MR. WILSON: That\u2019s the great idea, my son. You\u2019re\n    learning fast. But you must confess that my method is\n    better than sending a customer away angry, and it has\n    put you through college, besides, remember that.\n\n  JACK: I do, dad. Rule number six\u2014always tell a woman that\n    you\u2019re sure she takes a half-size smaller boot than you\n    know she does.\n\n  MR. WILSON: That\u2019s it. As a rule it tickles them all to\n    pieces. And you get their money and their good-will to\n    boot. [_Bell tinkles._] Here\u2019s another customer. Better\n    luck this time. [_Exit MR. WILSON. JACK busies himself\n    at table._]\n\n_Enter MISS FIRMROCK._\n\n  JACK: How do you do, Miss Firmrock, and what can I do for\n    you today?\n\n  MISS FIRMROCK: Young man, before I buy anything from\n    you, I must know how you stand on the woman suffrage\n    question. Do you believe that women should take an\n    active part in politics now that they are given the\n    vote?\n\n  JACK [_taken back_]: Do I believe what?\n\n  MISS FIRMROCK: That women should mix up in politics.\n    [_Emphasize words by pounding floor with umbrella._]\n\n  JACK [_aside_]: Now what in the dickens does she want\n    me to say? From her wording, I\u2019d say she was agin the\n    petticoat government. [_Aloud grandiloquently._] My\n    dear Madam, the woman\u2019s place is in the home, cooking\n    the meals, keeping the house clean,\u2014er\u2014er\u2014making the\n    children\u2019s dresses er\u2014er\u2014winding up the cat and putting\n    the clock out. Why should women need to enter into\n    politics? Is not her influence greater at home? Who has\n    not heard that beautiful and noble sentiment\u2014\u201cThe hand\n    that _rules_ the cradle _rocks_ the world.\u201d [_Aside._]\n    Gee, I didn\u2019t know I was such a speaker. [_Starts to\n    strut._] I hope dad got that.\n\n  MISS FIRMROCK: I knew as soon as I looked at you that you\n    were one of these lordly males, who believe in keeping\n    women a slave, a household drudge, with no more rights\n    than the criminal, the child and the imbecile. If women\n    do not help to do the governing, who is going to make\n    decent laws? Who is going to see that the bachelor\n    pays twice as much in taxes as the man who has a\n    family to support? Who is going to make this beautiful\n    country of ours a decent place to live in? The men?\n    [_Scornfully._] They\u2019ve had their try at it ever\n    since Columbus discovered America. And what have they\n    accomplished? [_Snaps her fingers._] Not that! I want\n    _nothing_ from you sir. I shall buy only in a store\n    where woman is not trodden upon. [_Starts to go._]\n\n  JACK [_aside_]: Imagine me treading on the likes of her?\n    But good-night! I\u2019ve backed the wrong horse. How in\n    the world am I going to fix it? [_Taps his head._]\n    I\u2019ve got it! A little bit of soft soap goes a long\n    way. [_Aloud._] Miss Firmrock, one moment, please.\n    [_She turns at door._] I had never given the matter any\n    thought or I certainly wouldn\u2019t have said what I did.\n    But you have enlightened me. [_Bowing._] You have made\n    me see that women must enter the political arena to\n    fight the beasts of bachelor\u2019s vice and\u2014and\u2014no\u2014backed\n    dresses! You have shown me that men as uplifters are\n    failures, that women alone can reform the world. Miss\n    Firmrock, how can I thank you?\n\n  MISS FIRMROCK [_comes back to C, shakes his hand_]: It\n    gives me great pleasure to know a man who is so open\n    to convictions as you are, Mr. Wilson; and I will feel\n    that I have accomplished something in life since I have\n    converted you to our cause. But really, Mr. Wilson, I\n    never knew that you were such an orator. I am going\n    to put you down for a speech at our Women\u2019s Club next\n    Wednesday evening. How will this subject suit you, \u201cThe\n    Failures Men Have Made\u201d? [_Takes out note-book and\n    writes._]\n\n  JACK [_aside, pretending to faint against table_]:\n    Suffering cats, what next! [_Aloud._] My dear Miss\n    Firmrock, [_aside_] Gee, it sounds like a proposal.\n    [_Aloud._] I\u2019ve never made a speech in public in all my\n    life and I\u2014\n\n  MISS FIRMROCK [_interrupts_]: Then it\u2019s time you were\n    beginning.\n\n  JACK [_desperately_]: Oh, really, I can\u2019t possibly go\n    that night; I have another engagement; I\u2014I\u2014you see I\n    have to go to prayer meeting.\n\n  MISS FIRMROCK: To prayer meeting! I\u2019ve never seen you\n    there in my life, so you can put off your starting for\n    another week.\n\n  JACK [_aside_]: If I don\u2019t have nervous prostration by\n    then, there\u2019s nothing for it but to get myself smashed\n    up in an auto accident. [_Aloud._] Well, I\u2019ll do my\n    best, Miss Firmrock. Were you wanting to buy anything?\n\n  MISS FIRMROCK: Yes, a pair of boots.\n\n  JACK [_pulls chair out_]: Now just sit here, Miss\n    Firmrock and I\u2019ll fit you. What size do you take?\n\n  MISS FIRMROCK: Six and a half.\n\n  JACK [_aside as he gets a box from table_]: Now, let me\n    see; the rule I\u2019ve learned by bitter experiences is,\n    \u201cTell the dears they have such little feet you\u2019re sure\n    they should take a smaller size.\u2033 Very well, I\u2019ll just\n    do that little thing. [_Aloud._] Now let me try these\n    sixes on you, Miss Firmrock. I\u2019m sure you can\u2019t take\n    a larger size than that, you have such little feet.\n    [_Gets down on knees to fit shoe. MISS F. boxes his\n    ears and he tumbles over._]\n\n  MISS FIRMROCK: How _dare_ you make fun of my feet?\n    [_Whacks him with umbrella. JACK jumps up._] I know\n    they\u2019re large and I\u2019m proud of it. The only people\n    capable of having big ideas in their heads are the\n    ones with feet large enough to give them a good\n    understanding. [_Grabs parcels._] I\u2019d like you to\n    know that I\u2019m not a silly, giggling fashion-plate\n    who insults her feet by sticking them into shoes far\n    too small for them and then minces along with her\n    heels raised on stilts. I can see you can\u2019t suit me so\n    I\u2019ll try another store, and you needn\u2019t bother about\n    that speech, either. We can manage without it. [_Goes\n    towards door R._]\n\n_Enter MR. WILSON._\n\n  MR. WILSON [_goes forward and shakes hands_]: How-do-you\n    do, Miss Firmrock. Allow me to congratulate you on the\n    excellent work you did in the prohibition campaign.\n    It\u2019s women like you who are bringing about the reforms\n    that are so badly needed in this country. And did you\n    get the boots you wanted?\n\n  MISS FIRMROCK: No, I didn\u2019t, this son of yours insulted\n    me, sir.\n\n  MR. WILSON: Oh, I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t do it intentionally.\n    But it is his first day at the shoe business and he\n    hasn\u2019t gotten onto the hang of it yet. It is a pair of\n    boots you were wanting?\n\n  MISS FIRMROCK [_appeased_]: Yes, a good sensible boot\n    that I don\u2019t have to be thinking about all the time.\n\n  MR. WILSON: We have the very thing. [_Takes box from\n    table and shows her a very large boot._] This size is\n    seven as it doesn\u2019t come in half sizes. You see it has\n    a low heel, wide last, cushion sole, everything that\n    tends for comfort. The price is twenty dollars and\n    thirty cents.\n\n  MISS FIRMROCK: I like the boot immensely, but I wouldn\u2019t\n    think of paying such a price. It\u2019s exhorbitant.\n\n  MR. WILSON: Not for this boot, Madam. This is a very\n    special boot, designed for broadminded women by the\n    greatest suffragette leader the world has ever known.\n    [_Impressively._] Madam, this is the _Pankhurst_ boot\n    you see before you. We are not allowed to sell it\n    to anyone who has not done something for the great\n    cause. You have proved yourself worthy, Miss Firmrock.\n    [_Bows._]\n\n  MISS FIRMROCK [_flattered_]: Oh, Mr. Wilson, do you\n    really think so? I\u2019ll take them and [_gushes_] every\n    time I wear them, I\u2019ll feel as though they were a bond\n    uniting that noble woman and me\u2014and I\u2019ll recommend them\n    to every woman I know.\n\n  MR. WILSON: In that case, I\u2019ll give them to you for\n    twenty and a quarter. Would you like to try them on?\n\n  MISS FIRMROCK [_pays_]: Oh no, I\u2019ll wait until I get\n    home. [_Takes boots._] Good afternoon, Mr. Wilson. I\n    hope you\u2019ll be able to make something out of your son\n    some day. He certainly doesn\u2019t seem to take after you.\n\n  MR. WILSON: No, I can\u2019t say that he does. He is just like\n    his mother. [_Exit_ MISS FIRMROCK.]\n\n  JACK [_mops his brow_]: Good lord, dad. If I have any\n    more of this, I\u2019ll be a stark, staring lunatic by\n    tonight. [_Shakes finger at him._] And I\u2019ll never trust\n    your old rules again. Look what that one did for me.\n\n  MR. WILSON: But there\u2019s an exception to every rule, and\n    if you knew anything about feminine psychology, you\n    would know at a glance that Miss Firmrock was the\n    exception, the one out of a thousand.\n\n  JACK: Hang feminine psychology and feminine vanity and\n    feminine feet and feminine everything else! A gents\u2019\n    establishment for mine! [_Brightens up._] But this last\n    failure of mine has saved you a mighty lot of money and\n    worry, dad.\n\n  MR. WILSON: How do you make that out?\n\n  JACK: It has prevented you from having your car smashed\n    to pieces and your son in the hospital. [_Bell\n    tinkles._] By jove, here\u2019s another customer. This is a\n    Jonah day for son Jack, all right.\n\n  MR. WILSON: That\u2019s a queer name to apply to a busy day.\n\n  JACK: Well, I\u2019m having a whale of a time, aren\u2019t I?\n\n_Exit MR. WILSON, laughing, at door L. Enter MRS. ATKINS at door R._\n\n  JACK: Good-morning, Mrs. Atkins, and what can I do for\n    you this afternoon?\n\n  MRS. ATKINS: Will you show me your litest style in boots?\n\n  JACK [_puzzled_]: Lightest? Do you mean boots with thin\n    soles?\n\n  MRS. ATKINS: No, it\u2019s good \u2019eavy walkin\u2019 boots I want,\n    but they must be in the litest style. I always gets the\n    litest in everything. Me \u2019usband, \u2019ee tells me I hain\u2019t\n    anything if not stylish.\n\n  JACK: Is it something in white you were wanting? That is\n    the lightest color we keep. [_Gets white boots._]\n\n  MRS. ATKINS: Oh, no. I want black so that I can wear them\n    every day.\n\n  JACK: But you said you wanted the lightest\u2014\n\n  MRS. ATKINS: Yes, the litest in black.\n\n  JACK [_aside_]: The lightest in black! The woman must be\n    crazy!\n\n_MR. WILSON comes to door. MRS. A. examines boots._\n\n  MR. WILSON [_aside to_ JACK]: _Latest, latest_, you\n    chump! Don\u2019t you know she\u2019s English?\n\n  JACK [_aside_]: I get you! [_Aloud._] Oh, you mean the\n    latest, Mrs. Atkins?\n\n  MRS. ATKINS [_tartly_]: Isn\u2019t that what I said, the\n    litest in black?\n\n  JACK [_hurriedly_]: Yes, certainly, Mrs. Atkins, and we\n    have the very latest here; never keep any other kind,\n    in fact. [_Places chair for her._] Just take this\n    chair, please. [_Aside._] Now, which class does she\n    belong to, the size smaller or size larger? Blest, if\n    I know. I\u2019ll try her on dad\u2019s Pankhurst dope first.\n    Shouldn\u2019t wonder but she would fall for that when she\u2019s\n    so English. [_Takes shoe from table and holds it up._]\n    Here, madam, you have before you the very latest thing\n    in boots, no other than the Pankhurst, designed by the\n    celebrated suffragette leader herself and\u2014 [MRS. ATKINS\n    _knocks boot out of his hand_.] Why, what\u2019s the matter?\n\n  MRS. ATKINS [_vehemently_]: Don\u2019t you dare to sell me a\n    boot that horrid woman\u2019s \u2019ad anything to do with.\n\n  JACK [_aside_]: Struck it wrong again. Oh the\n    contrariness of woman. [_Aloud._] But my dear madam,\n    surely you\u2019re an admirer of the woman who was the\n    greatest pioneer in fighting for the vote for women?\n\n  MRS. ATKINS [_jumps up excitedly_]: That\u2019s the very\n    reason I \u2019ate \u2019er. Votes for wimen! What does wimen\n    want with votes? Us women \u2019ave enough to do to cook our\n    \u2019usbands\u2019 meals and tend the childrens\u2019 noses and clean\n    up the \u2019ouse after the man\u2019s gone to work, leaving\n    hashes and mud all over the floor, the way he does.\n    [_Looks at boots on table._]\n\n  JACK [_aside, indicating fourth finger_]: This finger\n    says, Agree with everything a customer says. [_Aloud._]\n    That\u2019s my idea, entirely, Mrs. Atkins. I agree with you\n    there.\n\n  MRS. ATKINS [_turns on him_]: What do you know about it,\n    young man?\n\n  JACK [_confused_]: Why, I\u2014I\u2014\n\n  MRS. ATKINS: Hit\u2019s me who\u2019s \u2019ad to suffer on account of\n    the wimen being given the vote. My \u2019usband, \u2019ee\u2019s a\n    great one for electioneering, \u2019ee \u2019is, but he never\n    used to leave me alone at nights until wimen got the\n    frances. [_Sobs._] H\u2019ever since then, \u2019ee\u2019s been\n    spending \u2019is evenings in other wimen\u2019s \u2019omes, teaching\n    them how to vote and he\u2019s never h\u2019at \u2019ome any more\n    except for his meals. Ee do be regular for them, I must\n    si. Ee \u2019as such an appetite. [_Sighs deeply several\n    times._]\n\n  JACK [_aside_]: So that\u2019s where the shoe pinches!\n    [_Aloud._] Now, that\u2019s too bad, Mrs. Atkins. I don\u2019t\n    blame you for not wanting the Pankhurst boot. I\n    wouldn\u2019t wear it myself. I\u2019ll show you something else.\n    What size?\n\n  MRS. ATKINS: And you\u2019d sigh, too, young man, if you had\n    the troubles I\u2019ve had, with your \u2019usband finding fault\n    with the cooking ever since other wimen have been\n    feeding him up and\u2014\n\n  JACK [_hurriedly_]: What size boot do you take? That\u2019s\n    what I mean, Mrs. Atkins.\n\n  MRS. ATKINS [_gets ready to go_]: It doesn\u2019t matter wot\n    size I tike, for I\u2019m not tiking any boots. That\u2019s the\n    only style of boot I want hand I\u2019d buy it in a minute\n    if it didn\u2019t \u2019ave that odious woman\u2019s nime connected\n    with it. Not content with breaking windows, she \u2019as to\n    break up \u2019omes, too, the hussy. [_Goes towards door\n    R._] Good-h\u2019afternoon, sir.\n\n_Enter MR. WILSON._\n\n  MR. WILSON: Why, good-afternoon, Mrs. Atkins. I trust\n    you\u2019ve been served satisfactorily?\n\n  MRS. ATKINS [_tartly_]: No, I \u2019aven\u2019t, not with the\n    Pankhurst boot.\n\n  MR. WILSON [_picks up boot_]: Jack, why didn\u2019t you show\n    her this anti-suffragette style. I\u2019m sure Mrs. Atkins\n    would like this.\n\n  MRS. ATKINS: _The H\u2019ante-suffragette?_ Why, \u2019ee told me\n    it was the Pankhurst and\u2014\n\n  MR. WILSON [_looks surprised_]: Why, Jack, however could\n    you make such a mistake as that? The Pankhurst is a\n    different shoe, altogether. Only dowdy people wear\n    them. I wouldn\u2019t think of trying to sell that shoe to\n    _you_, Mrs. Atkins. But you\u2019ll have to make allowance\n    for my son, here. You see, this is his first day in\n    selling and he really doesn\u2019t know one style from the\n    other. But he\u2019ll soon learn.\n\n  JACK [_aside as he tidies up the tables_]: Not in a\n    thousand years, believe me!\n\n  MRS. ATKINS: I \u2019ope so, but \u2019ee doesn\u2019t look any\n    too bright, Mr. Wilson. [_JACK shakes fist in her\n    direction._]\n\n  MR. WILSON: Everyone says he takes after his mother.\n    [_Holds up boot._] Now, this is the very latest thing\n    we have, worn by all the fashionable and sensible\n    ladies who are against this tomfoolery of women voting\n    and entering into politics. It does nothing but break\n    up homes and\u2014and\u2014would you like to try it on?\n\n  MRS. ATKINS [_hurriedly_]: Oh no, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the right\n    size by the looks of it. [_Aside._] I wouldn\u2019t for\n    h\u2019anything let him see the \u2019ole where my big toe \u2019as\n    worked through my stocking. [_Aloud._] I\u2019ll tike them,\n    Mr. Wilson if they\u2019re not too expenses.\n\n  MR. WILSON: The price is ten dollars and forty-five\n    cents, but I\u2019m only charging you ten-forty on account\n    of the trouble you have had with my son. [_Wraps boots\n    up._]\n\n  MRS. ATKINS: H\u2019all right, Mr. Wilson, Atkins will be in\n    to piy for them Saturday night when \u2019ee gits his week\u2019s\n    wages. [_Takes parcel._] Good h\u2019afternoon, sir. [_Turns\n    towards JACK._] And to you too, sir. I ain\u2019t \u2019olding\n    any \u2019ard feelings agin you. You didn\u2019t know any better.\n    [_Exit._]\n\n  JACK [_wildly rumples hair as he strides back and\n    forth_]: Good heavens, this is awful. [_Stops in front\n    of MR. WILSON._] Do you see any change in my hair, dad?\n\n  MR. WILSON: No, why?\n\n  JACK: Then it hasn\u2019t turned grey?\n\n  MR. WILSON [_laughs_]: It will take more than that to\n    turn your head grey. But I thought you were going to\n    put it all over the dears until they would be tumbling\n    over each other to buy. Have I quoted you correctly?\n\n  JACK: That\u2019s right, rub it in. But when I said that,\n    I didn\u2019t know that I had to be a politician and a\n    feminine psychologist and\u2014and an accomplished liar in\n    order to sell a woman a pair of boots.\n\n  MR. WILSON: Not a liar, son. Be careful what you call\n    your respected parent.\n\n  JACK: Well, if what you have been doing all afternoon\n    isn\u2019t lying, I\u2019d like to know what you\u2019d call it.\n\n  MR. WILSON: Diplomacy, my boy.\n\n  JACK: The same thing under a fancy name.\n\n  MR. WILSON: Not at all. A lie is telling what is\n    absolutely untrue, Diplomacy is\u2014is\u2014oh yes, it is a\n    skillful juggling of the truth. [_Bell tinkles._] Here\n    comes your next triumph. I tell you what I\u2019ll do, I\u2019ll\n    give you ten dollars for every pair of boots, shoes or\n    slippers that you sell. [_Exit door L._]\n\n  JACK: I guess he knows his money\u2019s safe.\n\n_Enter MRS. O\u2019BRIEN, loaded up with bundles._\n\n  MRS. O\u2019BRIEN [_drops bundles on table and mops brow_]:\n    The saints presarve us, it is a hot day and it\u2019s the\n    loikes of me that knows it, bendin\u2019 over the washboard\n    ivery day of me loife, ceptin\u2019 the blissed howly-day,\n    doin\u2019 other folk\u2019s worruk while they dressin silks\n    and satin.

O\u2019BRIEN: And be yez a socialist loike meself?\n\n  JACK: Sure thing. I\u2019ve never been anything else.\n\n  MRS. O\u2019BRIEN: Then yez belave the rich should share with\n    the downtrodden poor?\n\n  JACK [_aside_]: Rule 4. Always agree, etc. [_Aloud._]\n    Certainly they should share and share alike I say.\n\n  MRS. O\u2019BRIEN [_Throws arms around him._]: Shure and yez\n    is a bohy afther me own heart. [_JACK frees himself._]\n    It be a pity that yer father ain\u2019t afther belavin\u2019 the\n    same as yez.

The\n    shoe\u2019s on the other foot now. [_Aloud._] I don\u2019t. He\n    was just telling a customer a few minutes ago that I\n    wasn\u2019t the least bit like him. And what can I sell you\n    today? [_As MRS. O\u2019BRIEN talks, he gets behind her and\n    pretends to wind her up._]\n\n  MRS. O\u2019BRIEN: Shure and Oim afther buyin\u2019 shoes for\n    all the chilrun. There\u2019s Betsy aged noine, she\u2019s me\n    roight-hand girrul. Then there\u2019s Pat ond Moike, twins\n    they be both borrun at the same toime and sick limbs\n    of Satan yez niver see, bless their hearuts. They\u2019re\n    siven.

[_Empties them\n    out._] They come cheaper that way. [_Pulls out very\n    small shoe._] Now, these are just the thing for Betsy.\n\n  MRS. O\u2019BRIEN: Bless me sowl! Me Betsy could niver git\n    aven her big toe into the loikes of them. They\u2019re more\n    Norah\u2019s size.\n\n  JACK: That\u2019s right. I meant Norah. My mistake. [_Pulls\n    out two pairs._] And these will suit the twins, Rory\n    and Mike\u2014\n\n  MRS. O\u2019BRIEN: Shure and Rory is six years behint Moike in\n    comin\u2019 into the worruld. It\u2019s Pat\u2014\n\n  JACK: Oh yes, of course, Pat and Mike. They always go\n    together. Well these will suit\u2014\n\n  MRS. O\u2019BRIEN: But shure and me Pat tikes a larger size\n    than Moike as his fate are bigger.\n\n  JACK: All the better, one of these is a size larger\n    than the other. Family lots are always sold that way.\n    Now here\u2019s the baby\u2019s [_holds up bootees_] and here\u2019s\n    [_holds up a larger shoe_] one pair for the baby to\n    grow into as its\u2014 [_MRS.

[_JACK wraps them up._.]\n\n  JACK [_aside_]: Six pairs of shoes and dad has promised\n    me ten dollars a pair. Pretty good business, I\u2019ll\n    tell the world. [_Aloud._] These come to twenty-three\n    dollars and seventy cents, Mrs. O\u2019Brien, but to\n    encourage the raising of large families, I\u2019ll just\n    charge twenty-three, sixty-eight. Will you pay for them\n    now or have them charged? [_Gives her the shoes._]\n\n  MRS. O\u2019BRIEN [_indignantly_]: Pay, did yez say? And\n    whoiver talked of payin\u2019?

Niver a cint will Oi be afther payin\u2019.\u2014 [_Starts\n    towards door R._]\n\n  JACK: Oh, but I didn\u2019t mean that you could cart away the\n    whole\u2014\n\n  MRS. O\u2019BRIEN: Then yez should say phwat yez mane and mane\n    phwat yez say. Oi wuz jist afther takin\u2019 yez at yer\n    worrud. [_Opens door._]\n\n  MR. WILSON [_comes in quickly_]: Just a minute, Mrs.\n    O\u2019Brien.\n\n  MRS. O\u2019BRIEN [_drops bundles_]: Howly Moses, and where be\n    yez afther comin\u2019 from?\n\n  MR. WILSON [_picks up shoes_]: From the back of the store\n    and Mrs. O\u2019Brien, I\u2019m very sorry, but you can\u2019t have\n    these shoes unless you pay cash for them.\n\n  MRS. O\u2019BRIEN: Pay cash? And Oi\u2019d loike to know how the\n    loikes of me can pay cash whin Oi haven\u2019t a cint to my\n    name. Bad cess to yez, yez ould skin-flint. [_Shakes\n    fist in his face._] Yez would skin a flea for its hide,\n    yez would. May the saints forgit yez and the devil fly\n    away with yez. [_Exit._]\n\n  JACK: Merciful heavens, dad, isn\u2019t she a howly terror?\n    But what gets me is after raising my hope to the high\n    pinnacle of sixty dollars, she shooed them away, worse\n    luck! I confess, dad, that I\u2019m an out and out failure.\n    I\u2019ve never put in such a day in all my life. I\u2019ll sell\n    newspapers, shovel coal, dig ditches or\u2014or\u2014or even\n    teach school before I\u2019ll put in another. I\u2019m through.\n    Not another customer will I wait on for all the money\n    in the world. [_Bell tinkles._] There goes that darned\n    bell. It\u2019s _me_ for the back shop this time. [_Hurries\n    toward door L._]\n\n  MR. WILSON [_looks toward entrance_]: Why, it\u2019s Betty\n    Moffat back, I wonder\u2014\n\n  JACK [_rushes back_]: I\u2019ll wait on her, dad. Clear out.\n\n_Enter BETTY._\n\n  MR. WILSON: But I thought\u2014\n\n  JACK: Don\u2019t, it\u2019s bad for the brain. Hustle. [_Exit MR.\n    WILSON._] Why, Bett\u2014Miss Moffat, I didn\u2019t think\u2014\n\n  BETTY [_mischievously_]: Don\u2019t, it\u2019s bad for the brain.\n    [_Both laugh._] I\u2019ve come back to tell you you were\n    right and\u2014\n\n  JACK [_puzzled_]: Right? What about?\n\n  BETTY: Why about those slippers; they _are_ too small for\n    me.\n\n  JACK [_aside_]: Hanged if I hadn\u2019t forgotten all about\n    that, but goodness knows I\u2019ve had enough other things\n    to worry about. [_Aloud._] Oh, no, Betty, I\u2019m sure they\n    are the right size; you have such dear little\u2014\n\n  BETTY: But they _are_ too small. I tried to dance in them\n    when I got home and they hurt my feet like everything.\n\n  JACK [_tenderly_]: Poor little feet!\n\n  BETTY: And I want a half size larger. [_Sits down. JACK\n    gets slippers and kneels to fit them._] And\u2014and I\u2019m\n    awfully sorry, Jack, that I was so horrid. I\u2019ve got a\n    nasty, mean temper and\u2014\n\n  JACK: Now, don\u2019t you dare call yourself names. Why Betty,\n    you\u2019re the sweetest girl that ever lived, you\u2019re\u2014you\u2019re\n    the dearest thing in boots!\n\n  BETTY: That\u2019s just what daddy says when he gets the bills\n    for them.\n\n  JACK: Oh, but I didn\u2019t mean it that way I\u2014 [_Aside._]\n    Hang it, I wish dad weren\u2019t taking in every word I say.\n    [_Calls._] Dad, come on out here and mind your robber\u2019s\n    den yourself for awhile. Betty and I are going to the\n    ice-cream parlor. Come on, Betty. [_Drags her a few\n    steps with one pump on._]\n\n  BETTY: Really Jack, don\u2019t you think I ought to put my\n    other pump on first? I wouldn\u2019t like to go like this.\n    What would people say?\n\n  JACK: What a dear little foot! [_Puts her slipper on her\n    foot._] Here you are. Come on. [_Exit BETTY and JACK\n    hand in hand._]\n\n  MR. WILSON [_Enters, picks up slipper and shakes his\n    head._]: The dearest thing in boots, eh? He\u2019s not far\n    off for I\u2019ll never be able to sell these. But what\u2019s a\n    pair of these to my boy\u2019s happiness? [_Pours out glass\n    of water and raises it._] So here\u2019s to the dearest\n    thing in boots\u2014and may they ever continue to buy\n    them\u2014the ladies, God bless them.
