    "body": "\"As one god to another--let's go home,\" Jack Bates said.\n\nBill Farnum raised a space-gloved hand in negligent acknowledgment to\na hastily kneeling native, and shook his head at Bates. \"Let's try\nDeneb--it's almost in line on the way back--and then we can call it\nquits.\"\n\n\"But I want to get back and start making some profit out of this. The\nGalaxy is full of _Homo sapiens_. We've hit the jackpot first trip out.\nLet's hurry on home and cash in.\"\n\n\"We need more information. This is too much of a good thing--it doesn't\nmake sense. I know there isn't much chance of finding anything out by\nstopping at one more solar system. But it won't delay us more than a\nfew weeks, and it won't hurt to try.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Bates. \"But what's in it for us? And what if we find an\ninhabited planet? You know the chances are about two to one that we\nwill. That'll make thirteen we've found on this trip. Why risk bad\nluck?\"\n\n\"You're no more superstitious than I am,\" said Farnum. \"You just want\nto get back Earthside. I'll tell you what. We'll toss a coin for it.\"\n\nBates gestured futilely toward his coverall pocket, and then\nremembered he was wearing a spacesuit as a precaution against possible\ncontamination from the natives.\n\n\"And we'll use one of _my_ coins this time,\" said Farnum, noticing the\nautomatic motion. \"I want to have a chance.\"\n\nThe coin dropped in Farnum's favor, and their two-man scout ship hurled\nitself into space.\n\n\n\nFarnum operated the compact computer, aligning the ship's velocity\nvector precisely while the stars could still be seen. Bates controlled\nthe engines, metering their ravenous demand for power just this side of\ndestructive detonation, while the ship sucked energy from space--from\nthe adjacent universe on the other side of Limbo. Finally the computer\nchimed, relays snicked, and the ship slid into the emptiness of Limbo\nas the stars winked out.\n\nWith two trained men working as a team with the computer and the\nelaborate engine room controls, and with a certain amount of luck, the\nship would drop back into normal space a couple of weeks later, close\nbeside their target.\n\n\"Well, that's that,\" said Farnum, relaxing and wiping the perspiration\noff his forehead. \"We're back once again in the nothingness of nowhere.\nAs I recall, it's your week for K.P. Where's the coffee?\"\n\n\"Coming right up,\" said Bates. \"But you won't like it. It's the last of\nthe 'God-food' the Korite priests made for us.\"\n\nFarnum shuddered. \"Pour it out and make some fresh. With a skillet, you\nstink, but you're a thousand times better than Korites.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Bates said, getting busy. \"It was the third place we stopped\nthat they were such good cooks, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Nope. Our third stop was the Porandians. They tried to kill us--called\nus 'Devil spawn from the stars.' You're thinking of the fourth stop;\nthe Balanites.\"\n\nBates shrugged. \"It's kind of hard to keep them all straight. Either\nthey fall on their knees and worship us, or they try to kill us without\neven asking questions. Maybe it's lucky they're all so primitive.\"\n\n\"It may be lucky, but it doesn't add up. More than half the stars we\nvisit have planets that can support human life. And every one that can\ndoes. Once there must have been an interstellar empire. So why are\nall their civilizations so backward? They aren't primitive--they're\ndecadent. And why do they all have such strong feelings--one way or the\nexact opposite--about people from the stars?\"\n\n\"Isn't that why you want to try one more system?\" asked Bates. \"To give\nus another chance to get some answers? Here's your coffee. Try to drink\nit quietly. I'm going to get some shuteye.\"\n\n\n\nThe trip through the Limbo between adjacent universes passed\nuneventfully, as always. The computer chimed again on schedule, and a\nquick check by Farnum showed the blazing sun that suddenly appeared was\nDeneb, as advertised. Seventeen planets could be counted, and the fifth\nseemed to be Earth type. They approached it with the easy skill of long\npractice and swung into orbit about it.\n\n\"This is what we've been looking for!\" exclaimed Farnum, examining\nthe planet through a telescope. \"They've got big cities and dams and\nbridges--they're civilized. Let's put the ship down.\"\n\n\"Wait up,\" said Bates. \"What if they've got starman-phobia? Remember,\nthey're people, just like us; and with people, civilization and\nweapons go together.\"\n\n\"I think you've got it backwards. If they hate us, we can probably get\naway before they bring up their big artillery. But what if they love\nus? They might want to keep us beside them forever.\"\n\nBates nodded. \"I'm glad you agree with me. Let's get out of here.\nNobody but us knows of the beautiful, profitable planets we've found,\nall ready to become part of a Terran Empire. And if we don't get back\nsafe and sound, nobody _will_ know. The information we've got is worth\na fortune to us, and I want to be alive to collect it.\"\n\n\"Sure. But we've got the job of trying to find out why all those\nplanets reverted to barbarism. This one hasn't; maybe the answer's\nhere. There's no use setting up an empire if it won't last.\"\n\n\"It'll last long enough to keep you and me on top of the heap.\"\n\n\"That's not good enough. I want my kids--when I have them--to have\ntheir chances at the top of the heap too.\"\n\n\"Oh, all right. We'll flip a coin, then.\"\n\n\"We already did. You may be a sharp dealer, but you'd never welch on a\nbet. We're going down.\"\n\nBates shrugged. \"You win. Let's put her down beside that big city over\nthere--the biggest one, by the seashore.\"\n\nAs they approached the city, they noticed at its outskirts a large\nflat plain, dotted with gantries. \"Like a spaceport,\" suggested Bill.\n\"That's our target.\"\n\nThey landed neatly on the tarmac and then sat there quietly, waiting to\nsee what would happen.\n\n\n\nA crowd began to form. The two men sat tensely at their controls, but\nthe throng clustering about the base of the ship showed no hostility.\nThey also showed no reverence but, rather, a carefree interest and\njoyful welcome.\n\n\"Well,\" said Farnum at last, \"looks like we might as well go outside\nand ask them to take us to their leader.\"\n\n\"I'm with you as usual,\" said Bates, starting to climb into his\nspacesuit. \"Weapons?\"\n\n\"I don't think so. We can't stop them if they get mad at us, and they\nlook friendly enough. We'll start off with the 'let's be pals' routine.\"\n\nBates nodded. \"After we learn the language. I always hate this part--it\nmoves so slowly. You'd think there'd be some similarity among the\ntongues on different planets, wouldn't you? But each one's entirely\ndifferent. I guess they've all been isolated too long.\"\n\nThe two men stepped out on the smooth plain, to be instantly surrounded\nby a laughing, chattering crowd. Farnum stared around in bewilderment\nat the variety of dress the crowd displayed. There were men and women\nin togas, in tunics, in draped dresses and kilts, in trousers and\ncoats. Others considered a light cloak thrown over the shoulders to be\nadequate. There was no uniformity of style or custom.\n\n\"You pick me a boss-man out of this bunch,\" he muttered to Bates.\n\nFinally a couple of young men, glowing with health and energy, came\nbustling through the crowd with an oblong box which they set down in\nfront of the Earthmen. They pointed to the box and then back at Farnum\nand Bates, laughing and talking as they did so.\n\n\"What do you suppose they want us to do?\" Farnum asked.\n\nOne of the young men clapped his hands happily and reached down to\ntouch the box. \"What do you suppose they want us to do?\" asked the box\ndistinctly.\n\n\"Oh. A recording machine. Probably to help with language lessons. Might\nas well help them out.\"\n\n\n\nFarnum and Bates took turns talking at the box for half an hour. Then\nthe young man nodded, laughed, clapped his hands again, and the two\nmen carried it away. The crowd went with them, waving merrily as they\ndeparted.\n\nBates shrugged his shoulders and went back into the ship, with Farnum\nclose behind.\n\nA few hours after sunrise the following morning, the crowd returned,\nas gay and carefree as before, led by the two young men who had carried\nthe box. Each of these two now had a small case, about the size of a\ncamera, slung by a strap across one brawny shoulder.\n\nAs the terrestrials climbed out to meet them, the two men raised their\nhands and the crowd discontinued its chatter, falling silent except for\nan occasional tinkle of surprised laughter.\n\n\"Welcome,\" said the first young man clearly. \"It is a great pleasure\nfor us to have our spaceport in use again. It has been many generations\nsince any ships have landed on it.\"\n\nFarnum noticed that the voice came from the box. \"Thank you for your\nvery kind welcome,\" he said. \"I hope that your traffic will soon\nincrease. May we congratulate you, by the way, on the efficiency of\nyour translators?\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" laughed the young man. \"But there was nothing to it. We just\nasked the Oracle and he told us what we had to do to make them.\"\n\n\"May we meet your--Oracle?\"\n\n\"Oh, sure, if you want to. But later on. Now it's time for a party. Why\ndon't you take off those clumsy suits and come along?\"\n\n\"We don't dare remove our spacesuits. They protect us from any disease\ngerms you may have, and you from any we may have. We probably have no\nresistance to each others' ailments.\"\n\n\"The Oracle says we have nothing that will hurt you. And we're going\nto spray you with this as soon as you get out of your suits. Then you\nwon't hurt any of us.\" He held up a small atomizer.\n\nFarnum glanced at Bates, who shrugged and nodded. They uneasily\nunfastened their spacesuits and stepped out of them, wearing only their\nlight one-piece coveralls, and got sprayed with a pleasant-smelling\nmist.\n\nThe party was a great success. The food was varied and delicious.\nThe liquors were sparkling and stimulating, without unpleasant\nafter-effects. The women were uninhibited.\n\nWhen a native got tired, he just dropped down onto the soft grass, or\nonto an even softer couch, and went to sleep. The Earthmen finally did\nthe same.\n\n\n\nThey awoke the following morning within minutes of each other, feeling\ncomfortable and relaxed. Bates shook his head experimentally. \"No\nhangover,\" he muttered in surprise.\n\n\"No one ever feels bad after a party,\" said one of their guides, who\nhad slept nearby. \"The Oracle told us what to do, when we asked him.\"\n\n\"Quite a fellow, your Oracle,\" commented Bates. \"Does he answer you in\nriddles, like most Oracles?\"\n\nThe guide was shocked. \"The Oracle answers any questions promptly and\ncompletely. He _never_ talks in riddles.\"\n\n\"Can we go to see him now?\" asked Farnum.\n\n\"Certainly. Come along. I'll take you to the Hall of the Oracle.\"\n\nThe Oracle appeared to live in a building of modest size, in the center\nof a tremendous courtyard. The structure that surrounded the courtyard,\nin contrast, was enormous and elaborate, dominating the wildly\narchitectured city. It was, however, empty.\n\n\"Scholars used to live in this building, they tell me,\" said one of\ntheir guides, gesturing casually. \"They used to come here to learn from\nthe Oracle. But there's no sense in learning a lot of stuff when the\nOracle has always got all the answers anyway. So now the building is\nempty. The big palace was built back in the days when we used to travel\namong the stars, as you do now.\"\n\n\"How long ago was that?\" asked Farnum.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know. A few thousand years--a few hundred years--the\nOracle can tell you if you really want to know.\"\n\nBates raised an eyebrow. \"And how do you know you'll always be given\nthe straight dope?\"\n\nThe guide looked indignant. \"The Oracle _always_ tells the truth.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Bates persisted, \"but how do you _know_?\"\n\n\"The Oracle told us so, of course. Now why don't you go in and find out\nfor yourselves? We'll wait out here. We don't have anything to ask him.\"\n\n\n\nBates and Farnum went into the building and found themselves in a\nsmall, pleasant room furnished with comfortable chairs and sofas.\n\n\"Good morning,\" said a well-modulated voice. \"I have been expecting\nyou.\"\n\n\"You are the Oracle?\" asked Farnum, looking around curiously.\n\n\"The name that the people of this planet have given me translates most\naccurately as 'Oracle',\" said the voice.\n\n\"But are you actually an Oracle?\"\n\n\"My principal function, insofar as human beings--that is, _Homo\nsapiens_--are concerned, is to give accurate answers to all questions\npropounded me. Therefore, insofar as humans are concerned, I am\nactually an Oracle.\"\n\n\"Then you have another function?\"\n\n\"My principal function, insofar as the race that made me is concerned,\nis to act as a weapon.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Bates. \"Then you are a machine?\"\n\n\"I am a machine,\" agreed the voice.\n\n\"The people who brought us here said that you always tell them the\ntruth. I suppose that applies when you are acting as an Oracle, instead\nof as a weapon?\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" said the voice blandly. \"I function as a weapon by\ntelling the truth.\"\n\n\"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Bates.\n\nThe machine paused for a moment before replying. \"This will take\na little time, gentlemen,\" it said, \"but I am sure that I can\nconvince you. Why don't you sit down and be comfortable? If you want\nrefreshments, just ask for them.\"\n\n\"Might as well,\" said Bates, sitting down in an easy chair. \"How about\ngiving us some Korite God-food?\"\n\n\"If you really want that bad a brew of coffee, I can make it for you,\nof course,\" said the voice, \"but I am sure you would prefer some of\nbetter quality.\"\n\nFarnum laughed. \"Yes, please. Some good coffee, if you don't mind.\"\n\n\n\n\"Now,\" said the Oracle, after excellent coffee had been produced, \"it\nis necessary for me to go back into history a few hundred thousand of\nyour years. At that time, the people who made me entered this galaxy\non one of their periodic visits of routine exploration, and contacted\nyour ancestors. The race that constructed me populates now, as it did\nthen, the Greater Magellanic Cloud.\n\n\"Frankly, the Magellanic race was appalled at what they found. In the\ntime since their preceding visit, your race had risen from the slime\nof your mother planet and was on its way toward stars. The speed of\nyour development was unprecedented in millions of years of history. By\ntheir standards, your race was incredibly energetic, incredibly fecund,\nincredibly intelligent, unbelievably warlike, and almost completely\ndepraved.\n\n\"Extrapolation revealed that within another fifty thousand of your\nyears, you would complete the population of this galaxy and would be\ntotally unstoppable.\n\n\"Something had to be done, fast. There were two obvious solutions\nbut both were unacceptable to my Makers. The first was to assume\ndirect control over your race and to maintain that rule indefinitely,\nuntil such time as you changed your natures sufficiently to become\ncivilizable. The expenditure of energy would be enormous and the\nresults probably catastrophic to your race. No truly civilized people\ncould long contemplate such a solution.\n\n\"The second obvious answer was to attempt to extirpate you from this\nuniverse as if you were a disease--as, in a sense, you are. Because\nyour depravity was not total or necessarily permanent, this solution\nwas also abhorrent to my Makers and was rejected.\n\n\"What was needed was a weapon that would keep operating without direct\ncontrol by my People, which would not result in any greater destruction\nor harm to humans than was absolutely necessary; and one which would\ncease entirely to operate against you if you changed sufficiently to\nbecome civilizable--to become good neighbors to my Makers.\n\n\"The final solution of the Magellanic race was to construct several\nthousand spaceships, each containing an elaborate computer, constructed\nso as to give accurate answers throughout your galaxy. I am one of\nthose ships. We have performed our function in a satisfactory manner\nand will continue to do so as long as we are needed.\"\n\n\"And that makes you a weapon?\" asked Bates incredulously. \"I don't get\nit.\"\n\n\n\nFarnum felt a shiver go through him. \"I see it. The concept is\ncompletely diabolical.\"\n\n\"It's not diabolical at all,\" answered the Oracle. \"When you become\ncapable of civilization, we can do you no further harm at all. We will\ncease to be a weapon at that time.\"\n\n\"You mean you'll stop telling the truth at that time?\" asked Bates.\n\n\"We will continue to function in accordance with our design,\" answered\nthe voice, \"but it will no longer do you harm. Incidentally, your\nphrase 'telling the truth' is almost meaningless. We answer all\nquestions in the manner most completely understandable to you, within\nthe framework of your language and your understanding, and of the\nunderstanding and knowledge of our Makers. In the objective sense, what\nwe answer is not necessarily the Truth; it is merely the truest form of\nthe answer that we can state in a manner that you can understand.\"\n\n\"And you'll answer any question at all?\" asked Bates in some excitement.\n\n\"With one or two exceptions. We will not, for example, tell you how we\nmay be destroyed.\"\n\nBates stood up and began pacing the floor. \"Then whoever possesses you\ncan be the most powerful man in the Universe!\"\n\n\"No. Only in this galaxy.\"\n\n\"That's good enough for me!\"\n\n\"Jack,\" said Farnum urgently, \"let's get out of here. I want to talk to\nyou.\"\n\n\"In a minute, in a minute,\" said Bates impatiently. \"I've got one more\nquestion.\" He turned to face the wall from which the disembodied voice\nappeared to emanate. \"Is it possible to arrange it so that you would\nanswer only one man's questions--mine, for example?\"\n\n\"I can tell you how to arrange it so that I will respond to only your\nquestions--for so long as you are alive.\"\n\n\"Come on,\" pleaded Farnum. \"I've got to talk to you right now.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" said Bates, smiling. \"Let's go.\"\n\n\n\nWhen they were back in their ship, Farnum turned desperately to Bates.\n\"Can't you see what a deadly danger that machine is to us all? We've\ngot to warn Earth as fast as we can and get them to quarantine this\nplanet--and any other planets we find that have Oracles.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, you don't,\" said Bates. \"You aren't getting the chance to have\nthe Oracle all to yourself. With that machine, we can rule the whole\ngalaxy. We'll be the most powerful people who ever lived! It's sure\nlucky for us that you won the toss of the coin and we stopped here.\"\n\n\"But don't you see that the Oracle will destroy Earth?\"\n\n\"Bushwah. You heard it say it can only destroy people who aren't\ncivilized. It said that it's a spaceship, so I'll bet we can get it to\ncome back to Earth with us, and tell us how we can be the only ones who\ncan use it.\"\n\n\"We've got to leave here right away--without asking it any more\nquestions.\"\n\nBates shook his head. \"Quit clowning.\"\n\n\"I never meant anything more in my life. Once we start using that\nmachine--if we ask it even one question to gain advantage for\nourselves--Earth's civilization is doomed. Can't you see that's what\nhappened to those other planets we visited? Can't you see what is\nhappening to this planet we're on now?\"\n\n\"No, I can't,\" answered Bates stubbornly. \"The Oracle said there are\nonly a few thousand like him. You could travel through space for\nhundreds of years and never be lucky enough to find one. There can't be\nan Oracle on every planet we visited.\"\n\n\"There wouldn't have to be,\" said Farnum. \"There must be hundreds of\npossible patterns--all of them destructive in the presence of greed\nand laziness and lust for power. For example, a planet--maybe this\none--gets space travel. It sets up colonies on several worlds. It's\nexpanding and dynamic. Then it finds an Oracle and takes it back to its\nown world. With all questions answered for it, the civilization stops\nbeing dynamic and starts to stagnate. It stops visiting its colonies\nand they drift toward barbarism.\n\n\"Later,\" Farnum went on urgently, \"somebody else reaches the stars,\nfinds the planet with the Oracle--and takes the thing back home. Can\nyou imagine what will happen to these people on this world if they\nlose their Oracle? Their own learning and traditions and way of life\nhave been destroyed--just take a look at their anarchic clothing\nand architecture. The Oracle is the only thing that keeps them\ngoing--downhill--and makes sure they don't start back again.\"\n\n\"It won't happen that way to us,\" Bates argued. \"We won't let the\nOracle get into general use, so Earth won't ever learn to depend on it.\nI'm going to find out from it how to make it work for the two of us\nalone. You can come along and share the gravy or not, as you choose. I\ndon't care. But you aren't going to stop me.\"\n\nBates turned and strode out of the ship.\n\n\n\nFarnum pounded his fist into his palm in despair, and then ran to a\nlocker. Taking out a high-power express rifle, he loaded it carefully\nand stepped out through the airlock. Bates showed clearly in his\ntelescopic sights, still walking toward the Hall of the Oracle. Farnum\nfired at the legs, but he wasn't that good a shot; the bullet went\nthrough the back.\n\nFarnum jittered between bringing Bates back and taking off as fast as\nthe ship could go. The body still lay there, motionless; there was\nnothing he could do for the Oracle's first Earth victim--the first\nand the last, he swore grimly. He had to speed home and make them\nunderstand the danger before they found another planet with an Oracle,\nso that they could keep clear of its deadly temptations. The Magellanic\nrace could be outwitted yet, in spite of their lethal cleverness.\n\nThen he felt a sudden icy chill along his spine. Alone, he could never\noperate the spaceship--and Bates was dead. He was trapped on the planet.\n\nFor hours, he tried to think of some way of warning Earth. It was\nimperative that he get back. There had to be a way.\n\nHe realized finally that there was only one solution to his problem.\nHe sighed shudderingly and walked slowly from the spaceship toward the\nHall of the Oracle, past Bates' body.\n\n\"One question, though,\" he muttered to himself. \"Only one.\"",
