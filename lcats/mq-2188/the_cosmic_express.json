    "body": "stenciled in gold capitals across it.\n\nAs they approached, a lean man, carrying a black bag, darted out of an\nelevator shaft opposite the door, ran across the corridor, and entered.\nThey pushed in after him.\n\nThey were in a little room, cut in two by a high brass grill. In front\nof it was a long bench against the wall, that reminded one of the\nwaiting room in an old railroad depot. In the grill was a little window,\nwith a lazy, brown-eyed youth leaning on the shelf behind it. Beyond him\nwas a great, glittering piece of mechanism, half hidden by the brass. A\nlittle door gave access to the machine from the space before the grill.\n\nThe thin man in black, whom Eric now recognized as a prominent French\nheart-specialist, was dancing before the window, waving his bag\nfrantically, raving at the sleepy boy.\n\n\"Queek! I have tell you zee truth! I have zee most urgent necessity to\ngo queekly. A patient I have in Paree, zat ees in zee most creetical\ncondition!\"\n\n\"Hold your horses just a minute, Mister. We got a client in the machine\nnow. Russian diplomat from Moscow to Rio de Janeiro.... Two hundred\nseventy dollars and eighty cents, please.... Your turn next. Remember\nthis is just an experimental service. Regular installations all over the\nworld in a year.... Ready now. Come on in.\"\n\nThe youth took the money, pressed a button. The door sprang open in the\ngrill, and the frantic physician leaped through it.\n\n\"Lie down on the crystal, face up,\" the young man ordered. \"Hands at\nyour sides, don't breathe. Ready!\"\n\nHe manipulated his dials and switches, and pressed another button.\n\n\"Why, hello, Eric, old man!\" he cried. \"That's the lady you were telling\nme about? Congratulations!\" A bell jangled before him on the panel.\n\"Just a minute. I've got a call.\"\n\nHe punched the board again. Little bulbs lit and glowed for a second.\nThe youth turned toward the half-hidden machine, spoke courteously.\n\n\"All right, madam. Walk out. Hope you found the transit pleasant.\"\n\n\"But my Violet! My precious Violet!\" a shrill female voice came from\nthe machine. \"Sir, what have you done with my darling Violet?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know, madam. You lost it off your hat?\"\n\n\"None of your impertinence, sir! I want my dog.\"\n\n\"Ah, a dog. Must have jumped off the crystal. You can have him sent on\nfor three hundred and--\"\n\n\"Young man, if any harm comes to my Violet--I'll--I'll--I'll appeal to\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals!\"\n\n\"Very good, madam. We appreciate your patronage.\"\n\n\n\nThe door flew open again. A very fat woman, puffing angrily, face highly\ncolored, clothing shimmering with artificial gems, waddled pompously out\nof the door through which the frantic French doctor had so recently\nvanished. She rolled heavily across the room, and out into the corridor.\nShrill words floated back:\n\n\"I'm going to see my lawyer! My precious Violet--\"\n\nThe sallow youth winked. \"And now what can I do for you, Eric?\"\n\n\"We want to go to Venus, if that ray of yours can put us there.\"\n\n\"To Venus? Impossible. My orders are to use the Express merely between\nthe sixteen designated stations, at New York, San Francisco, Tokyo,\nLondon, Paris--\"\n\n\"See here, Charley,\" with a cautious glance toward the door, Eric held\nup the silver flask. \"For old time's sake, and for this--\"\n\nThe boy seemed dazed at sight of the bright flask. Then, with a single\nswift motion, he snatched it out of Eric's hand, and bent to conceal it\nbelow his instrument panel.\n\n\"Sure, old boy. I'd send you to heaven for that, if you'd give me the\nmicrometer readings to set the ray with. But I tell you, this is\ndangerous. I've got a sort of television attachment, for focusing the\nray. I can turn that on Venus--I've been amusing myself, watching the\nlife there, already. Terrible place. Savage. I can pick a place on high\nland to set you down. But I can't be responsible for what happens\nafterward.\"\n\n\"Simple, primitive life is what we're looking for. And now what do I owe\nyou--\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right. Between friends. Provided that stuff's genuine!\nWalk in and lie down on the crystal block. Hands at your sides. Don't\nmove.\"\n\nThe little door had swung open again, and Eric led Nada through. They\nstepped into a little cell, completely surrounded with mirrors and vast\nprisms and lenses and electron tubes. In the center was a slab of\ntransparent crystal, eight feet square and two inches thick, with an\nintricate mass of machinery below it.\n\nEric helped Nada to a place on the crystal, lay down at her side.\n\n\"I think the Express Ray is focused just at the surface of the crystal,\nfrom below,\" he said. \"It dissolves our substance, to be transmitted by\nthe beam. It would look as if we were melting into the crystal.\"\n\n\"Ready,\" called the youth. \"Think I've got it for you. Sort of a high\nisland in the jungle. Nothing bad in sight now. But, I say--how're you\ncoming back? I haven't got time to watch you.\"\n\n\"Go ahead. We aren't coming back.\"\n\n\"Gee! What is it? Elopement? I thought you were married already. Or is\nit business difficulties? The Bears did make an awful raid last night.\nBut you better let me set you down in Hong Kong.\"\n\nA bell jangled. \"So long,\" the youth called.\n\nNada and Eric felt themselves enveloped in fire. Sheets of white flame\nseemed to lap up about them from the crystal block. Suddenly there was a\nsharp tingling sensation where they touched the polished surface. Then\nblackness, blankness.\n\n\n\nThe next thing they knew, the fires were gone from about them. They were\nlying in something extremely soft and fluid; and warm rain was beating\nin their faces. Eric sat up, found himself in a mud-puddle. Beside him\nwas Nada, opening her eyes and struggling up, her bright garments\nstained with black mud.\n\nAll about rose a thick jungle, dark and gloomy--and very wet. Palm-like,\nthe gigantic trees were, or fern-like, flinging clouds of feathery green\nfoliage high against a somber sky of unbroken gloom.\n\nThey stood up, triumphant.\n\n\"At last!\" Nada cried. \"We're free! Free of that hateful old\ncivilization! We're back to Nature!\"\n\n\"Yes, we're on our feet now, not parasites on the machines.\"\n\n\"It's wonderful to have a fine, strong man like you to trust in, Eric.\nYou're just like one of the heroes in your books!\"\n\n\"You're the perfect companion, Nada.... But now we must be practical. We\nmust build a fire, find weapons, set up a shelter of some kind. I guess\nit will be night, pretty soon. And Charley said something about savage\nanimals he had seen in the television.\n\n\"We'll find a nice dry cave, and have a fire in front of the door. And\nskins of animals to sleep on. And pottery vessels to cook in. And you\nwill find seeds and grown grain.\"\n\n\"But first we must find a flint-bed. We need flint for tools, and to\nstrike sparks to make a fire with. We will probably come across a chunk\nof virgin copper, too--it's found native.\"\n\nPresently they set off through the jungle. The mud seemed to be very\nabundant, and of a most sticky consistence. They sank into it ankle deep\nat every step, and vast masses of it clung to their feet. A mile they\nstruggled on, without finding where a provident nature had left them\neven a single fragment of quartz, to say nothing of a mass of pure\ncopper.\n\n\"A darned shame,\" Eric grumbled, \"to come forty million miles, and meet\nsuch a reception as this!\"\n\nNada stopped. \"Eric,\" she said, \"I'm tired. And I don't believe there's\nany rock here, anyway. You'll have to use wooden tools, sharpened in the\nfire.\"\n\n\"Probably you're right. This soil seemed to be of alluvial origin.\nShouldn't be surprised if the native rock is some hundreds of feet\nunderground. Your idea is better.\"\n\n\"You can make a fire by rubbing sticks together, can't you?\"\n\n\"It can be done, I'm sure. I've never tried it, myself. We need some dry\nsticks, first.\"\n\nThey resumed the weary march, with a good fraction of the new planet\nadhering to their feet. Rain was still falling from the dark heavens in\na steady, warm downpour. Dry wood seemed scarce as the proverbial hen's\nteeth.\n\n\"You didn't bring any matches, dear?\"\n\n\"Matches! Of course not! We're going back to Nature.\"\n\n\"I hope we get a fire pretty soon.\"\n\n\"If dry wood were gold dust, we couldn't buy a hot dog.\"\n\n\"Eric, that reminds me that I'm hungry.\"\n\nHe confessed to a few pangs of his own. They turned their attention to\nlooking for banana trees, and coconut palms, but they did not seem to\nabound in the Venerian jungle. Even small animals that might have been\nslain with a broken branch had contrary ideas about the matter.\n\nAt last, from sheer weariness, they stopped, and gathered branches to\nmake a sloping shelter by a vast fallen tree-trunk.\n\n\"This will keep out the rain--maybe--\" Eric said hopefully. \"And\ntomorrow, when it has quit raining--I'm sure we'll do better.\"\n\nThey crept in, as gloomy night fell without. They lay in each other's\narms, the body warmth oddly comforting. Nada cried a little.\n\n\"Buck up,\" Eric advised her. \"We're back to nature--where we've always\nwanted to be.\"\n\n\n\nWith the darkness, the temperature fell somewhat, and a high wind rose,\nwhipping cold rain into the little shelter, and threatening to demolish\nit. Swarms of mosquito-like insects, seemingly not inconvenienced in the\nleast by the inclement elements, swarmed about them in clouds.\n\nThen came a sound from the dismal stormy night, a hoarse, bellowing\nroar, raucous, terrifying.\n\nNada clung against Eric. \"What is it, dear?\" she chattered.\n\n\"Must be a reptile. Dinosaur, or something of the sort. This world seems\nto be in about the same state as the Earth when they flourished\nthere.... But maybe it won't find us.\"\n\nThe roar was repeated, nearer. The earth trembled beneath a mighty\ntread.\n\n\"Eric,\" a thin voice trembled. \"Don't you think--it might have been\nbetter-- You know the old life was not so bad, after all.\"\n\n\"I was just thinking of our rooms, nice and warm and bright, with hot\nfoods coming up the shaft whenever we pushed the button, and the gay\ncrowds in the park, and my old typewriter.\"\n\n\"Eric?\" she called softly.\n\n\"Yes, dear.\"\n\n\"Don't you wish--we had known better?\"\n\n\"I do.\" If he winced at the \"we\" the girl did not notice.\n\nThe roaring outside was closer. And suddenly it was answered by another\nraucous bellow, at considerable distance, that echoed strangely through\nthe forest. The fearful sounds were repeated, alternately. And always\nthe more distant seemed nearer, until the two sounds were together.\n\nAnd then an infernal din broke out in the darkness. Bellows. Screams.\nDeafening shrieks. Mighty splashes, as if struggling Titans had upset\noceans. Thunderous crashes, as if they were demolishing forests.\n\nEric and Nada clung to each other, in doubt whether to stay or to fly\nthrough the storm. Gradually the sound of the conflict came nearer,\nuntil the earth shook beneath them, and they were afraid to move.\n\nSuddenly the great fallen tree against which they had erected the flimsy\nshelter was rolled back, evidently by a chance blow from the invisible\nmonsters. The pitiful roof collapsed on the bedraggled humans. Nada\nburst into tears.\n\n\"Oh, if only--if only--\"\n\n\n\nSuddenly flame lapped up about them, the same white fire they had seen\nas they lay on the crystal block. Dizziness, insensibility overcame\nthem. A few moments later, they were lying on the transparent table in\nthe Cosmic Express office, with all those great mirrors and prisms and\nlenses about them.\n\nA bustling, red-faced official appeared through the door in the grill,\nfairly bubbling apologies.\n\n\"So sorry--an accident--inconceivable. I can't see how he got it! We got\nyou back as soon as we could find a focus. I sincerely hope you haven't\nbeen injured.\"\n\n\"Why--what--what--\"\n\n\"Why I happened in, found our operator drunk. I've no idea where he got\nthe stuff. He muttered something about Venus. I consulted the\nauto-register, and found two more passengers registered here than had\nbeen recorded at our other stations. I looked up the duplicate beam\ncoordinates, and found that it had been set on Venus. I got men on the\ntelevision at once, and we happened to find you.\n\n\"I can't imagine how it happened. I've had the fellow locked up, and\nthe 'dry-laws' are on the job. I hope you won't hold us for excessive\ndamages.\"\n\n\"No, I ask nothing except that you don't press charges against the boy.\nI don't want him to suffer for it in any way. My wife and I will be\nperfectly satisfied to get back to our apartment.\"\n\n\"I don't wonder. You look like you've been through--I don't know what.\nBut I'll have you there in five minutes. My private car--\"\n\n\n\nMr. Eric Stokes-Harding, noted author of primitive life and love, ate a\nhearty meal with his pretty spouse, after they had washed off the grime\nof another planet. He spent the next twelve hours in bed.\n\nAt the end of the month he delivered his promised story to his\npublishers, a thrilling tale of a man marooned on Venus, with a\nbeautiful girl. The hero made stone tools, erected a dwelling for\nhimself and his mate, hunted food for her, defended her from the mammoth\nsaurian monsters of the Venerian jungles.\n\nThe book was a huge success.\n\n\nTHE END",
