    "body": " _How doth the Simple Spelling-bee\n  Impruv each shining ower._\n\n\nOf course, I know not how it may be with you; but with me the mail\nbrings daily a multitude of communications that I have not sought, and\ndo not want; nor do I refer to bills alone; and so, when there came one\nday a printed card saying:--\n\n     Why Heifer?\n\nI tossed it into my waste-paper basket, and remembered it no more. Some\ndays had passed, during which I had worked onward at the index of my\nforthcoming volume, when my memory was jogged by the arrival of a new\nabsurdity:--\n\n     Why not Heffer?\n\nLike its predecessor, this card went at once into my basket. I had\nnearly finished the B's in my index before the mail brought the\nfollowing:--\n\n     It ought to be your custom now\n     To simplify, and spell plough plow;\n     Therefore write quickly on your cuff\n     From this day forth to spell tough tuff.\n     A third must follow these first tu,\n     So you will always spell through thru,\n     Nor in the midst of things leave off,\n     But joyfully now make cough coff.\n     By this time you must clearly noa\n     Dough can't be doe, do, dow, but doa.\n\nWell, if they purposed to reform our spelling, which has always been a\nmere rag-bag of lawlessness, I hoped that they would do it right; but I\nwas too deeply immersed in completing the index of my forthcoming volume\nto spend thought upon this question; nor did I court interruption. My\nwaste-paper basket, therefore, received another willing contribution.\nAnd when presently the clue to these cards reached me in the following\ntelegraphic message, just at the outset of my morning's work:--\n\n                  CHICKLE UNIVERSITY,\n               Arkansopolis, October 6, 1906.\n     English spelling rotten to the core. Help us.\n               MASTICATOR B. FELLOWS.\n\nI responded, not without satire:--\n\n     Utterly prostrated by news. Helpless.\n               THOMAS GREENBERRY.\n\nAnd thinking that thus I was rid of him, I proceeded quietly with the\nindex of my forthcoming volume.\n\nBut Masticator B. Fellows, president and proprietor of Chickle\nUniversity, had not done with me so easily. Since his street-boyhood,\nsixty years ago, this ardent personality ('tis thus the daily press\ndescribes him) had made his own way, and had his own way; he was his\nown capital, and there is no record of his ever having sunk a cent of\nit. Of habits strictly pure, he had never seen a card or a drop of\nliquor that he had touched, and he had never seen a dollar that he had\nnot touched. He had organized every industry along his path, from\npaper-selling, boot-blacking, and so upward to his organized lobby at\nWashington, through which he had caused a heavy tariff to be put upon\nevery commodity necessary to the American people. It was he who had\nadvised his brother organizers to keep Religion on the free list,\nbecause, as he assured them, \"if we tax it, they'll do without it,\nwhile if we don't, they'll trust us for a while yet.\" And now, at the\nage of seventy-five, with uncounted millions, and ten United States\nSenators, and a fourth young wife all in his pocket, he proposed to hand\nhis name to Immortality by simplifying the spelling of English all over\nthe earth. Well, let him do it if he would only do it right.\n\nBut this he must do without my assistance; there were other professors,\nmany of them. I did not permit the circulars that now began to pour in\nfrom Chickle University to distract me from my index. Striking as these\ncirculars were--and I will instance but one of them:--\n\n     Judge, budge, ridge, acknowledge\n               ARE SLOW\n     Call in and try our Quick Spelling\n     Juj. Buj. Rij. Aknolej--\n\nthey went into the basket one after another. To this method of\nsuggestion a second was soon added, and my coat-pockets, as well as my\nmail, began to be filled with spelling literature. I would go out for a\nwalk, and during this exercise some paper or pamphlet would be slipped\ninto the coat, which I would discover upon my return. I remember pulling\nout a little book of verse, beginning:--\n\n     I am only a primer to teach you to spel,\n     Which is something that nobody does very wel.\n       A sweet little primer,\n       A dear little primer,\n     Sing hel, bel, tel, fel, sel, nel, quel, swel and smel.\n\nI felt, let me confess it, annoyed the next day on returning from my\nwalk to find a new method of suggestion, in great charcoal letters, on\nthe white marble of my house-front:--\n\n            Such nuisances as\n     Solemn Comptroller and Wednesday\n             are preventing\n            THE KING OF SIAM\n          from learning English\n\nNor was my annoyance decreased by the further announcement that defaced\nmy house-front upon the day following:--\n\n     MILLIONS OF SCHOOL CHILDREN\n     turn away weeping from\n     PEOPLE MANUOEVRE DIAPHRAGM\n\nMuch should be conceded to the man who is fighting for his Immortality,\nas was Masticator; but not too much. And displeasure, it may fairly be\nsaid, began to rise in me, when I found, next morning, a page of the\nprimer introduced in the midst of my index:--\n\n     Of the bad English spelling you'll surely beware,\n     When you notice how stair, pear and heir rhyme with there;\n       The sad English spelling,\n       The mad English spelling,\n     Sing hi! for the mare and the mayor and the prayer.\n\n     Next consider, for instance, a word like enhearsed:\n     Now what business has it to be rhyming with first?\n       Sing hi! the old spelling,\n       The horrible spelling,\n     The spelling of nursed and of versed and of worst.\n\n     But our simplified speling can cure every il,\n     And permits nothing foolish like two l's in pil.\n       Sing hi! the new speling,\n       Our comforting speling,\n     Sing pil, bil, fil, wil, til, sil, quil, spil.\n\nYes, Masticator was going too far--and how had he managed to tamper\nwith my index? I rang the bell, and questioned my man Edward sharply. He\nknew nothing of it, nor did the housemaid, whom I also questioned\nsharply. And I trusted I should be less harassed on the morrow.\n\nBut on the morrow, at breakfast, lifting with my fork the top buckwheat\ncake in order to spread butter upon the second, I found a leaflet\nbetween the two cakes, inscribed:--\n\n       Phthisis\n     How can you eat while a word like that is allowed?\n\nI flung the cakes at my man Edward, and in five minutes I had dismissed\nevery servant in the house. Quite unable to work, I left the house\nmyself, and set out to take the air. No; Masticator was not doing it\nright; he was taking too many sudden liberties, not only with the\nlanguage, but with myself. Becoming gradually aware that a number of\nyoung persons were following me with loud and disconcerting expressions,\nI stepped into a shop where I am unknown, and where they at once offered\nto brush off my back. A double mirror showed me these words, chalked\nplainly:--\n\n     He wants a\n         P\n     in Consumtion\n\nBeing now without servants, I decided that I should be free from\npersecution in the luxurious wilderness of a great hotel. Upon getting\ninto bed in my room in the twelfth story, a dreadful contact caused me\nto leap to the floor, where my foot dashed down upon some similar\ndreadfulness, and the shock threw me flat on my face and stomach, only\nto feel myself instantly plastered with more of the same odious and\nencasing substance. I believe that I shouted loudly in the dark for some\ntime before hotel employees rushed to my succor; the door was burst open\nand the light turned on. It was fly-paper; and much time was consumed in\nrelieving my person of it. Every piece bore its motto, such as:--\n\n     If you'll but drop the e in pi\n     Better on stomach pi will li.\n\nand also:--\n\n     The b in lam\n     's not worth a dam--\n\nand others.\n\nAs early as possible the next morning I sent a message of capitulation\nto Masticator B. Fellows.\n\n     What can I do for you?\n\nwas the message; and the reply came back:--\n\n     Delighted you are with us.\n     Private car train twenty-one to-day.\n\nThe secretary of Masticator was at the steps of the car and presented me\nat once to a most lovely girl. At the news she was to serve on the\nSimplified Spelling Committee with me, my heart bounded, every doubt\nleft me, and I exclaimed:--\n\n\"I will spell just as you say.\"\n\n\"Then,\" she most sweetly returned, \"never let us consent to any\nsimplification of kiss.\" And I counted such answer a very happy omen.\n\nShe had come from a woman's college, and her important work on the\nauthorship of Shakespeare's plays had demonstrated, beyond refutation,\nthat the plays had been written by Queen Elizabeth, in collaboration\nwith Sir Walter Raleigh and Lady Jane Grey.\n\n\"Shall we be in Harrisburg soon, Mr. Kibosh?\" she asked the secretary.\n\n\"It will be ten minutes after seven, Miss Appleby.\"\n\n\"And that is a whole three hours!\" she cried, with no pleasure in her\nvoice.\n\n\"Here is some good chickle,\" said Kibosh. And when she would take none,\n\"Then I will,\" he said. \"The private stock of Masticator B. Fellows. The\npublic gets nothing like this.\"\n\nHe took a small object from the box that he held and put it in his\nmouth; and soon, while the train sped on, his large long jaws were\noscillating with a smooth motion, and content, like a lukewarm glaze,\noverspread his immense bald features.\n\nThus it came to me what chickle was. \"Chewing-gum!\" I exclaimed!\n\nKibosh opened gentle eyes upon me. \"We do not use that word at\nArkansopolis.\" He smiled, removed the plastic morsel from his mouth, and\nplaced it on the window-sill, that he might speak to me without\nimpediment.\n\n\"We always say chickle at Arkansopolis. We like that better. Masticator\nB. Fellows likes that better. When his genius bought up the small\nplants----\"\n\n\"Is there a chewing-gum trust, too?\" asked Miss Appleby.\n\n\"Chickle, Miss Appleby, chickle, if you please. When Masticator's genius\norganized this noble industry, thereby placing a superior, pure, cheap,\nand uniform article within the reach of eighty million jaws----\"\n\n\"But the whole nation does not chew gum!\" the lovely girl again, with\nsome spirit, interrupted.\n\n\"Chickle, Miss Appleby, if you please. Fifty per cent of our population\nchickles, and that makes eighty million jaws. When the time came\nto--ahem--float the proposition, after the bonds, there was an issue of\none billion preferred, and two billions of common stock. It did not seem\nfitting, Miss Appleby, it did not seem dignified, that Wall Street\nshould bandy back and forth such an expression as--ahem--'chewing-gum\ncommon.' To the eye, such an expression printed in the financial\ncolumns would seem--would--in short, hence chickle, Miss Appleby, noun\nand verb. Never anything else at Arkansopolis. Will you not chickle now?\nNo? Ah, well. But at least you are with us in the Higher Spelling.\" His\nhand sought the window-sill, and then his mouth; and his jaws resumed\ntheir placid oscillation.\n\nMiss Appleby had gone out upon the broad rear platform of our car; and\nthere, as she sat alone, I joined her, saying:--\n\n\"Shall we talk of the Higher Spelling?\"\n\nBut she seemed inclined for not much talk upon any subject; and the\nnearer Harrisburg drew, the more difficult I found it to engage her\nattention.\n\n\"There is nothing to see,\" I assured her when, as our train entered the\nstation, she left me with something almost like eagerness.\n\nI did not get out during our somewhat long stop, being occupied in my\nprivate stateroom with unpacking and disposing my clothes for the\njourney. As we started again, I emerged to find Miss Appleby in bright\nconversation with a newcomer.\n\n\"Professor Jesse Willows,\" said Kibosh, \"of Paw-paw University, Mountain\nDew City.\" And as the extraordinarily handsome young man rose, quite\nsix-feet-two, to greet me, Kibosh continued: \"The professor's\nDictionary of Deadly Weapons, as well as his great work on Bowie-Knives\nin the Stone Age, makes him a welcome member of our committee.\"\n\nI felt, I know not why, less glad to see this Professor Willows than\nMiss Appleby seemed. His long black coat and black tie were fairly\nproper for a man of erudition; but his hat was soft and broad of brim,\nand his trousers were of brown corduroy, drawn over high boots.\n\n\"And what, sir,\" I asked him, \"may your views be on the Higher\nSpelling?\"\n\n\"Bless yore heart, suh,\" he gayly responded, \"what's spellin', anyway?\nJust alphabet lettuhs fixed like some man chose to fix 'em befo' you\nan' me were bawn. An' so I say such a man's had his notions more'n long\nenough, and it's high time we-all took a whirl at the dictionary.\"\n\n\"I admit, sir,\" I responded, \"that our spelling is but a rag-bag of\nlawlessness. But it has been ratified by a noble army of great writers.\nThey and the daily press have spread it over the world. Therefore we\nmust go slowly. We must do it right. Derivation----\"\n\n\"Bless yore heart, suh,\" the impetuous youth interrupted me, \"what's\nderivation? Just conquest follo'd by mispronunciation. Julius Caesuh he\nlambastes Gaul; and he talks Latin to 'em; he says '_honor_,' an' he\ngoes home; an' the Gauls retain Caesuh's _i_dea, as all puffeck gennlemen\nshould, but the nearest they kin git to the Latin is '_honneur_.' An'\nthen, whoop they come over to England, an' they lambaste the\nAnglo-Saxons, an' talk to 'em about '_honneur_.' An' the Anglo-Saxons,\nbein' also puffeck gennlemen, they ketches on to the _i_dea, but\nbe-Jeroosalemmed if they kin say it straight, either; an' so it gits to\nbe '_honour_.' An' then comes our glorious Revolution; an' we tell the\nEnglish, 'Good-by to yo', King Geawge. Good-by to yore iniquitous\nparliament. Good-by to yore whole dog-goned outfit of tyrants and\nhelots. We-all don' keer how you-all spell anything whatsoever, an' the\nlanguage of Washington, an' Jeffuhson, an' Patrick Henry, an' all the\nglorious fathuhs of libuhty, is goin' to spell it _honor_ without a u.'\nAn' there you are, back to yore original Latin.\"\n\n\"A noble sentiment, Professor,\" said Kibosh. \"A truly noble sentiment.\nWill you not join me in a chickle?\"\n\nThe professor bounded to his full, long height, with all the agility of\nthe _felis catus_ of his own wild, native mountains.\n\n\"I'm with you, suh!\" he exclaimed. \"Be-Jeroosalemmed if I wasn't pow'ful\nthirsty.\"\n\n\"Chickle is not liquid refreshment,\" said Kibosh, mildly; and he held\nout the box to his tall guest.\n\nThe professor glared at it for a moment. \"You and yore chickle,\" he then\nbegan, with alarming deliberation, \"can go right----\"\n\nA quick, girlish cough sounded behind him.\n\n\"----to my private cabin in this cyah,\" the professor continued, with no\nchange in countenance or voice, \"where I will join you, and where we\nwill find liquid refreshment.\"\n\nKibosh did not dare refuse him, and I came without being asked.\n\n\"It's a glorious exercise, suh,\" said the professor to me, in the\nprivate cabin.\n\n\"In moderation, yes,\" I answered.\n\n\"May I inquiuh to what you-all are referrin'?\" he asked haughtily.\n\n\"Why, to this,\" I answered, tapping my glass.\n\nThe professor grew more stiff. \"I referred to simplifyin' the spellin'\nof our language,\" he said.\n\n\"A glorious exercise?\" I repeated vaguely.\n\n\"Fo' the imagination, suh. Turn yore eye whah you will, you'll see words\nthat need refawmin', words that need our help, words that cry an' clamuh\nto be relieved of the stigma of their congested and nonsensical\nappearance; nouns, adjectives, verbs, all stuck in the hopeless mud of\nantiquity, an' holdin' out their hands for we-all to drag 'em out an'\nbring 'em up to date.\" He now gave me a list. \"Look, suh, at those\npore, sufferin', aged cripples, awaitin' the renewal of their youth.\"\n\n\"You have a magnificent collection,\" I remarked to him, after a glance\nat the list.\n\n\"Pshaw!\" he returned. \"I could double that in an hour. I just jotted\nthat down as I came up the valley from Paw-paw in the Chattanooga\nLimited. Why, just lookin' out of the cyah windo' would give me notions.\nI saw a thistle. Down she went on the list, an' down went whistle next\nher, suggested by our locomotive. Thistle. Whistle. Look at those\ndisgraces. Look at the dead wood in 'em. Are not they just congested\nall up with pitfalls for the young? Once we get to work at Arkansopolis,\nand they'll be thissl and wissl, or my name is not Jesse Willows.\"\n\nHe paused, and I looked at his list again. The railway journey had given\nhim a number of suggestions; I saw, in hasty writing:--\n\n     Freight. That's dopy. Should be frate.\n     Bridge. Another has-been. Brij.\n\nMy perusal was interrupted by his seizing the list away from me. \"The\npo'tuh has turned the gas higher,\" he said. \"That gives me another whole\nbig line of 'em.\" And he wrote:--\n\n     Light should be lite. So also fight, and tight and others on the\n     same plan.\n\n\"Po'tuh!\" he called out, \"what is yore name?\"\n\n\"Michael, Colonel,\" the man answered.\n\n\"Another!\" exclaimed the professor. And he wrote:--\n\n     Michael, Mycle, because cycle.\n     Bicicle because icicle.\n\nI kept various doubts to myself, and resolved that such must continue my\npolicy if I were ever to have peace; but, no matter how I might agree to\nspell bicycle, I was secretly determined never to address my younger\nbrother as Mycle. Imagine thus mutilating a name that had been in our\nfamily for generations!\n\nProfessor Willows showed his list to Miss Appleby; I saw him, and I saw\nher evidently add some words to it. But, to my surprise, this seemed to\ncause them mirth. They did not seek my company, and conversed together\nwithout ceasing, in a corner of our car, while Kibosh slumbered; and I\nwondered if the Higher Spelling was the subject that brought their heads\nso close to each other. That girl was more and more a disappointment to\nme; and I retired in no very good humor.\n\nMycle was not the only word to which, as I dressed myself next morning,\nI found my opinion to be entirely adverse; frate seemed to me\nobjectionable, nor did I feel any leanings toward brij and lite. And the\nsurprising readiness with which Professor Willows accepted my criticism\nfailed to make upon me the happy impression which the adoption of one's\nviews by another is apt to cause.\n\n\"You don't like frate, suh?\" he said, whipping out his pencil, and\nquickly writing on his list. \"Bless yore heart, then we'll just make it\nfrait. How does that hit yore fancy?\"\n\nI thanked him for his amiability, but my fancy was as little hit by\nfrait as it had been by frate; and it was still less hit when he came to\nme with his customary enthusiasm some twenty-five minutes after\nbreakfast, to show me forty-three more words that he had simplified\nsince rising from table. Still keeping all thoughts to myself, I read:--\n\n     Earth and dearth to irth and dirth, like mirth. Also worth to\n     wirth. Pheasants whirr. Cats should pirr.\n\nI passed the list back with I know not what commendations of his\nrapidity. He retired with it to the rear platform, where sat Miss\nAppleby; and almost immediately I heard egregious peals of laughter\ncoming from them both. This, for some reason, kindled in me such\nannoyance that I put my head out of the door, and cried loudly to them:\n\"Do you intend to make flirt flurt, or hurt hirt? And how about squirt?\"\nAnd I shut the door sharp upon my words before they could make answer\nto me. But still, even through the closed door and thick plate-glass\nwindows, their shameless merriment reached me, and seemed, if anything,\nlouder than ever.\n\nThe outlook for the Higher Spelling was scarce a bright one, I thought,\nif the rest of my colleagues, whom I had yet to meet, should approach\ntheir solemn responsibilities in anything of the spirit shown by\nProfessor Willows and Miss Appleby. His facile adoption of a new\nspelling, and equally facile relinquishment of it, gave but poor\nevidence of any deep thought on this matter; and to see him through the\nplate-glass as he talked to her on the rear platform, no one would\neasily be persuaded that spelling was the subject of their colloquy; and\nlastly, when he fetched a large shawl and hung it across the window\noutside, so that they were wholly screened from view, I found it no\nlight effort to believe that it was to shield her from the cold blast,\nas he informed me.\n\nI sought (without great eagerness) the companionship of Kibosh. \"Do you\nnot fear,\" I asked him, \"that we may not find ourselves able to reach an\nagreement as to the system by which this respelling should proceed?\"\n\n\"What would hinder it?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Of course, our present spelling is but a rag-bag of lawlessness,\" I\nreplied, for I was growing fond of my description of it. \"But great\nauthors and newspapers have spread it round the globe. The sun never\nsets on English spelling. We must join the great English universities\nwith us. We must join Canada, India, Australia. We must do it right.\"\n\n\"England will have to follow us!\" he declared.\n\n\"If you'll watch England,\" I said, \"I think you'll find she has her own\nideas about that.\"\n\n\"Then our publishers and writers will ignore England,\" he replied.\n\n\"If you'll watch our publishers and writers,\" I again said, \"you'll see\nthey'll be slow to let go their English market by making books that\nwould be illegible throughout the British Empire.\"\n\n\"What are authors, anyhow?\" he demanded. \"It is our business men who are\nour glory.\"\n\n\"If you'll watch our business men,\" I repeated, not without acerbity,\n\"you'll find they have London correspondents, and they'll not care to\nrun two sorts of spelling with their stenographers.\"\n\nKibosh thought awhile, and then, with his gentle smile, he again removed\nhis chickle and placed it on the window-sill.\n\n\"But, nevertheless, Masticator will have gained his point,\" he said.\n\n\"Scarcely so, if a system fails us, and we do nothing,\" I suggested.\n\nHe seemed not to hear me. \"And all of the committee, every member, will\nhave gained the point as well.\"\n\n\"You'll pardon me, but what is the point?\" I now asked him.\n\n\"And the English language,\" he continued more and more gently, \"it will\nhave gained the point, too.\"\n\n\"I must confess,\" I said, \"to utter ignorance of your meaning.\"\n\nKibosh smiled for a long while, looking at me very kindly.\n\n\"You will readily appreciate,\" he at length began, \"that the greatest\nneed of mankind is Publicity. It is as essential to the German Emperor\nas it is to the female society leader, or the trick mule. We are no\nexceptions, we leaders of thought, and teachers of youth, and captains\nof industry; we too must have Publicity or--ahem--pass under. And as the\ndemand for Publicity increases, the supply of it naturally diminishes.\nYou understand that? Well, now, any association with Masticator B.\nFellows means Publicity at once for the lucky individual. But there are\ntimes when the vast sweep of economic currents ties up all the available\nPublicity, and at those times great enterprises languish from its\nscarcity. It may befall that even such giant operators as Masticator B.\nFellows find themselves embarrassed. It is then only the man of genius\nwhose magic hand can smite the rock in some novel way, and cause\nPublicity again to gush forth fresh and sparkling--it is then only he\nwho is heard from. There has been such a time of late. Publicity was\ntied up, and Masticator needed some for his--for certain plans he has to\nbenefit the human race. Now, what does Masticator do? He surveys the\ngeneral situation, he thinks it over, and presently he says 'Spelling\nReform.' He smites the rock, and there you have it. You understand me?\nWell, supposing you gentlemen do fail to--ahem--make any considerable\nimpression upon the English language, you will have made a considerable\nimpression on the public; the rock will have gushed, Masticator's point\nwill be gained. He will have secured the Publicity he needs for his--his\nbenevolent enterprises; each of you gentlemen will have secured\nPublicity for your names and works; and we mustn't forget the English\nlanguage. It will have got Publicity, too; it needs it, like all the\nrest of us. I'm sure you understand me.\"\n\nThus Kibosh finished, and it entered my mind to descend at our next\nstop, and take the first train back to my own place; but this thought I\nquickly dismissed, remembering Masticator's methods of reaching those\nwhom he wanted. And (although I know this is unworthy) I was become\nvery curious to see what we should all do, once we were gathered\ntogether. Were all the rest of my colleagues coming for Publicity? I\nglanced at the window, where the shawl still screened Professor Willows\nand Miss Appleby, and it seemed to me that they had come rather for\nPrivacy.\n\n\"Who are the rest of my colleagues?\" I now asked Kibosh.\n\n\"Well, now, I'm afraid you've got me,\" he responded. \"There's--let me\nsee--Professor Flawless Nathaniel Maverick, of Fishball University,\nMassachusetts. He is with us. A profound scholar, sir.\"\n\n\"What is his line?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well, now, that's another tough one. Let us see. Did he write The Fuel\nof the Future?\"\n\nI shook my head, being ignorant.\n\n\"Or was it The Mustard Plaster in Pharaoh's Time?\" Kibosh dreamily\npursued.\n\n\"What is the fuel of the future?\" I asked.\n\n\"Pecan nuts. I am certain of that,\" answered Kibosh. \"But whether he's\nthat one, or whether it's Lysander Totts----\"\n\n\"Who is Lysander Totts?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Another profound scholar, sir. Of Numa Pompilius University, New York.\nBut we've got them from all around--from Seminole, Florida, Oglethorpe,\nGeorgia, Lafitte, Louisiana, Sandys, Virginia, Graftsburg,\nPennsylvania--but you'll meet them to-morrow at Chickle University. All\nprofound scholars, sir. It was Totts, come to think of it.\"\n\n\"Think of what?\" I asked.\n\n\"Pecan nuts,\" said Kibosh.\n\nI should have been glad to learn the names of all my colleagues, and\nwhat they had written, that I might be the better prepared to meet them;\nbut Kibosh could be sure only of Totts and his book; and Professor\nWillows and Miss Appleby had not heard even of Totts, when I asked them\nat lunch to enlighten me.\n\n\"What mattuh, suh?\" cried Willows, cheerily. \"They'll tell you quick\nenough themselves why they're so famous.\"\n\nAt this remark Miss Appleby broke into much gayety.\n\n\"Got many words this mawnin', Professuh?\" asked Willows of me; and I\nretorted, with what should have been telling reproof, that I was not of\nthose who can improvise thorough work.\n\nIt was extraordinary how much this young man's remarks pleased Miss\nAppleby. He was but a poor companion for the lovely girl; and when,\nafter lunch, he retired to slumber in his cabin (as he called it), I\ntook my seat beside her on the rear platform. She was most amiable, but\nbade me first take down the shawl behind us. The cold blasts, she said,\nhad ceased. We talked for some time, and it was easy to see that under\nproper guidance her mind would open to all befitting things. Not until\nProfessor Willows came out of his cabin and joined us, did I feel her\ngrow distant again. Without preliminary, he asked: \"What does a man who\nsits down on a sharp needle most resemble?\" And, without waiting, he\nanswered, \"A profane upstart.\"\n\nInto such levity I could not possibly enter; I resolved to wait the\nmorrow, and the succeeding days of our convention at Chickle University,\nfor opportunities to exert upon this impressionable young girl my\nwholesome influence.\n\nWe reached our destination during the forenoon of the next day, and I\nwas amazed when I beheld spreading out before me the vast institution\nwhere we were to hold our sittings. Chickle University covered, with its\ngrounds and buildings, four square miles. Swift electric cars ran\neverywhere by routes so well planned that less than four minutes were\nconsumed between the two most distant points. The several thousand\nbuildings were of a uniform pattern, but lettered on the outside, so as\neasily to be distinguished: House of Latin, House of Chiropody, House of\nMarriage and Divorce, and so forth. Everything was taught here, and had\nits separate house; and the courses of instruction were named on a plan\nas uniform as the buildings: Get French Quick, Get Religion Quick, Get\nFootball Quick, and so forth. The University was open to both sexes. I\nsaw great crowds of young men and women trying to push their way into\nthe House of Marriage and Divorce; and Kibosh informed me that this\ncourse was the second in popularity, and in such active demand that a\ncorps of ninety-six instructors was kept lecturing continuously day and\nnight. The football course had overflowed its own building so copiously\nthat it was also filling the houses of Latin, Greek, Music, History, and\nLiterature.\n\n\"And what do those students do?\" I inquired.\n\n\"There have been none,\" he answered. \"We have accommodations for two\nmillion students; but if this spelling reform fails to prove\nthe--ahem--you'll remember what we said about rock-smiting, Mr.\nGreenberry--fails to prove the--er--attraction that Masticator\nanticipates, any idle houses in this University plant can be readily\nturned into the Chickle plant, which adjoins it.\"\n\nI asked him, would they not meet great difficulty in finding professors\nfor two million students?\n\n\"Professors are our lightest expense,\" he replied. \"We can always pick\nthem up for next to nothing.\"\n\nSo saying, Kibosh led us to the library; and here were some gentlemen\nassembled whose appearance clearly proclaimed them to be profound\nscholars, and who were to be of our spelling committee. While Kibosh\nmade us known to each other, and we exchanged our formal greetings, the\neye of each scholar sought the eye of every other scholar with that\nthirsty look an author wears, when the hope for compliments upon his\nwritings flutters in his breast. But we were true professors, all of us,\nand not one had read a word that any of the others had ever written.\n\nDeceit should always be discouraged, nay, firmly punished, in the young;\nfor by reason of their immaturity they have but little judgment when to\npractise it; but to the old it is frequently of the greatest service.\nIntending, therefore, to be as agreeable as possible, I approached\nProfessor Lysander Totts with a feigned knowledge of his work. Shaking\nhim cordially by the hand, I said, \"Ah, yes; Pecan Nuts!\"\n\n\"What?\" he replied, staring.\n\n\"Why, Pecan Nuts!\" I repeated. \"Let me congratulate----\"\n\n\"My name is Totts,\" he interrupted.\n\n\"To be sure!\" I exclaimed. \"Who has not read The Fuel of the Future?\"\n\n\"I haven't,\" said Totts.\n\nI corrected myself hastily. \"What an absurd slip of the tongue!\" I\ngayly ejaculated. \"I meant Mustard Plasters in Pharaoh's Time.\"\n\n\"I haven't read that, either,\" said Totts.\n\nI should now have been at some loss, but a plaintive voice behind me\nsaid, \"Hup, hup, hup, hup.\"\n\nI turned, and saw a smiling little old man, with delicate silver locks\nthat hung well-nigh to his collar.\n\n\"Hup, hup,\" said he again, very amiably.\n\nI turned back to Totts in bewilderment.\n\n\"He stutters,\" Totts explained.\n\nThe voice behind me now said with a sudden sort of explosion, \"I wrote\nit.\"\n\nI turned again, and, catching both his hands as a drowning man is said\nto catch a straw, I wrung them earnestly and long. \"A great work!\" I\ncalled out to him, as if he were deaf. \"A very great work!\" And not well\nknowing what I did, I further shouted to Miss Appleby, who was passing\nus: \"He wrote it! Pecan Nuts!\"\n\n\"Hup, hup,\" said the little man. \"Mustard Plasters.\"\n\nLittle as I owe Miss Appleby, I must always hold her memory in gratitude\nfor her coming forward at this extreme moment.\n\n\"Of course it is Mustard Plasters!\" she said, with delightful sweetness;\n\"and you must write your name in my copy, dear Professor Egghorn.\"\n\nHe extended an eager hand for the volume.\n\n\"It is in my trunk,\" she continued promptly; \"and your signature will\nmake a unique gem of what is already a precious treasure. And you, dear\nProfessor Totts, when I am unpacked, you will surely not refuse me the\nsame honor? Professor Totts, you know,\" she added to me, \"has proved\nthat Cleopatra was a man.\"\n\n\"Then who wrote Pecan Nuts?\" I whispered to her hastily.\n\n\"He hasn't come yet,\" she hastily whispered back.\n\n\"I am sure,\" said Kibosh, leading a tall new arrival among us, \"that\nProfessor Camillo Cottsill needs no introduction here. We all welcome\nthe man who has said the last word on--the last word on--on--well, now,\nreally, it escapes me, Professor,\" he finished, turning his wide, gentle\nsmile upon the newcomer, who glared at him angrily, and announced with\nunnecessary loudness:--\n\n\"Nostalgia in the Lobster.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Professor,\" said Kibosh; \"thank you kindly. I think lunch is\nnow awaiting us in the House of Bread.\"\n\nAfter brief preparation in the rooms assigned to us, we lunched with the\nstudents; and, as I passed down the hall, I saw Totts and Egghorn\nsigning their respective volumes for Miss Appleby.\n\n\"So quickly unpacked?\" I asked her.\n\n\"Dear, no!\" she returned. \"Professor Willows easily bought them for me\nat the University Book Shop.\"\n\n\"I have but one complaint against your exquisite deceit,\" I said to her.\n\"Why did you leave me out?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" she said, \"who could deceive you?\"\n\nI strove, but unsuccessfully, to occupy a seat beside her at table; it\nwas Jesse Willows who got it, the other being taken by Egghorn, while\nTotts placed himself opposite. Napoleon preferred men with great noses,\nbut that of Totts would have pleased him too well, I think; and Totts\nblew it continually. It was my hope that supper, or dinner, or whatever\nthey called the next meal, would not be served with the distressing\nrapidity of this one; one had barely the time to swallow, and the food\nwent whole down one's throat; but the next meal, and all meals, were the\nsame, and, had our convention lasted longer than it did, I should have\nfallen victim to a grave dyspepsia. This, I learned, was another\ninstance of the vast genius of Masticator B. Fellows: while educating\nhis students, he created in them the need for the product of his own\nmonopoly. He gave them no time to chew at their meals, and chickle was\nserved free in all the houses. For chewing, at some time or other, is\nnecessary to digestion, and among the thousands at Chickle University I\nsaw not one anywhere, boy or girl, whose mouth was not going like a slow\nrabbit's; and to judge from the universal oscillatory motion of the jaws\nof the American people in trains and all public places, I see they are\nlearning that great economic principle of Masticator's, which is\nannounced everywhere in the street cars:--\n\n     TIME IS MONEY\n\n     He who chickles\n     Saves his nickles--\n\nnickles being the simple spelling of nickels.\n\nThis great man allowed us at length to see him next morning, when we\nassembled to begin our work. We sat round an imposing table some twenty\nstrong--for all the profound scholars were now arrived--and in front of\neach scholar, on the ample green baize table-cover, was a great\ndictionary, with a great glass inkstand and writing materials. Tall\nblackboards stood behind us, waiting to receive the words we should\nreform; but the best of it was to find myself sitting next Miss Appleby,\nwith Willows quite an agreeable distance away. Kibosh had arranged all\nour seats, and it is the best thing I know of him.\n\nWhen Masticator B. Fellows entered to open our convention, it was\nplain at once whence Kibosh had acquired his manner and his\nappearance--so far as he could acquire this latter: the secretary might\nhave been an early, bad photograph of the magnate. To see Masticator, he\nwas the creature of brotherly love, the preacher of benign gospels, the\nteacher of female academies; no smell of Senate or Syndicate hung about\nhim. Bald, with a silken skull-cap, bland, with his ten pointed fingers\nmeeting as if to bless, with a sunrise smile, and a black coat as long\nand unlovely as conscious virtue, he stood before us in benevolent\nsilence, and we rose as one scholar. But at once he motioned us to sit\ndown.\n\n\"I think there's a dollar-sign in his jaw,\" whispered Miss Appleby to\nme.\n\nAlready Masticator was addressing us, slowly and softly.\n\n\"Dear friends,\" he said, \"be welcome. I am worth two hundred and\nforty-five millions. Thank God that you are not. Thank God that you are\npoor. Thank God for your scanty meals and clothing, and your ceaseless\nfailure to make both ends meet. Pray God you may die poor. How I envy\nyou all your blessed privilege of struggle! Thank God, and now to\nbusiness.\n\n\"Everything is getting better. Man is getting better. Woman is getting\nbetter. Life, Liberty, Happiness--all getting better. And chickle.\nBetter and better. Then why not English Spelling? Dear friends, I expect\nresults from you. Let us sing the Ode.\"\n\nA gasoline organ began to play at the end of the apartment, and we\nprofound scholars stood up and sang together:--\n\n     My spelling 'tis of thee,\n     Sweet land of spelling-bee,\n       Of thee I sing.\n     Land of the pilgrims' pride,\n     Land where my fathers dide,\n     For spelling simplifide\n       Let freedom ring\n\n\"A beautiful pome,\" said Lysander Totts, on my other side.\n\n\"Where were you educated?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Surracuse, Noo Yorruk,\" he responded; and he blew his large nose.\n\n\"And now, dear friends,\" Masticator was saying, \"I leave you. Remember\nthe poor foreigners, remember the little children. It is for them that\nthe English language exists; and for them we must, therefore, smooth our\nspelling's cruel path. I expect results, dear friends.\" So saying, he\nwas gone.\n\n\"Yes, there is a dollar-sign in his jaw,\" repeated Miss Appleby.\n\n\"Suggestions are now in order,\" said Kibosh, taking the chairman's seat.\n\nThree profound scholars stood up. \"The only way----\" they began, with\none voice.\n\n\"Professor Flawless Nathan Maverick has the floor,\" said Kibosh. \"I\npresume the Professor will think no change in pecan nuts necessary.\" And\nthe chairman smiled sociably at the scholar.\n\n\"The only way,\" said Maverick, \"is to abolish all words that foreigners\ncannot spell.\"\n\n\"You mean cut 'em out of the language, suh?\" inquired Jesse Willows.\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Phew!\" whistled Willows.\n\n\"Order, gentlemen,\" smiled the chairman. \"Professor Camillo Cottsill has\nthe floor.\"\n\n\"The only way,\" said this scholar, \"is to abolish all words that\nchildren cannot spell.\"\n\n\"Phew!\" repeated Willows.\n\n\"Order, gentlemen, please,\" said the chairman, gently tapping an\ninkstand with a pencil. But he was not heeded.\n\n\"Who are you whistling at?\" demanded Camillo Cottsill.\n\n\"Can't yore children spell?\" retorted Willows.\n\n\"Can yours?\" shouted Cottsill.\n\nAt this Jesse Willows blushed a deep red, and so did Miss Appleby.\n\n\"He is not married, Professor,\" said Kibosh, tapping the inkstand\nsoothingly.\n\n\"My little daughter Zola B. can spell everything,\" said Maverick.\n\n\"How about the others?\" demanded Cottsill.\n\n\"My salary only affords me one,\" stated Maverick, with resignation.\n\n\"Then how can you judge?\" said Cottsill. \"Receive, and believe, and\nbereave should be cut out at once.\"\n\n\"They should not,\" said Maverick.\n\n\"Oh, cut everything out,\" sighed Willows.\n\n\"Hup, hup, hup, hup,\" began Professor Egghorn.\n\n\"The author of Mustard Plasters has the floor,\" said Kibosh, with\ncivility.\n\n\"The only way,\" continued Egghorn, \"is to hup, hup, hup.\"\n\n\"Start the organ, please,\" said Kibosh to an assistant; and while the\ngasoline music played, \"My spelling 'tis of thee,\" Kibosh walked round\nthe table and gave every one an individual box of chickle. We chewed in\nsilence, waiting for the voice of Professor Egghorn to go again.\n\n\"Hup, hup,\" said he, at length; \"phonetic.\"\n\n\"I object!\" Cottsill and Maverick called out loudly together.\n\n\"I move it's phonetic,\" said Totts.\n\n\"Second the hup, hup,\" said Egghorn.\n\n\"Those in favor----\" Kibosh began.\n\n\"That's not properly seconded,\" interrupted Cottsill.\n\n\"Motion!\" finished Egghorn, with a shriek. And we carried phonetic by\neighteen to two.\n\n\"Since Professor Egghorn has shown us the only way,\" said Kibosh, \"will\nhe not kindly lead off with his suggestions for a reform list?\"\n\nBut once again the professor's utterance was transfixed.\n\n\"Give the pore gennleman a piece of chalk,\" said Willows, \"and send him\nto the blackboa'd.\"\n\nWith the blackboard we now made visible progress, which I decided it was\nbest for the present not to interrupt. Let as many suggestions as\npossible be made; then we could weed them out. Consent was undivided\nupon a number of words, and some old spelling passed away in peace. The\nletter u disappeared from honor and favor, although, with much surprise,\nI overheard Miss Appleby saying to herself that she intended to retain\nit in all her private correspondence. The k was kicked out of Frederic.\n\n(\"There's nothing new about that, either,\" said Miss Appleby, in a\nwhisper.)\n\n\"But I shall not permit any such liberty to be taken with my own name,\"\nsaid Professor Maverick, firmly; and this was conceded to him, Professor\nTotts objecting.\n\n\"We shall never reach consistency at this rate,\" grumbled Lysander\nTotts.\n\n\"Who came here to be consistent?\" retorted Maverick.\n\n\"We came here for spelling reform,\" added Camillo Cottsill.\n\n(\"Good gracious,\" said Miss Appleby, under her breath.)\n\nPresently it was the letter h that occupied us; and old honour now\nbecame onor (some were for oner, but gave in), followed by erb, our, and\numor.\n\n\"What's that?\" demanded Totts, pointing to our.\n\n\"Time of day,\" answered Maverick. \"Sixty minutes make one our.\"\n\n\"Then nobody can tell it from our cat, our cow,\" said Professor Totts.\n\n\"We can't help that,\" said Maverick.\n\n\"We're only here for simplification,\" Cottsill said again.\n\n(\"Good gracious,\" repeated Miss Appleby.)\n\n\"Make it ower,\" suggested Cottsill; and this was done.\n\n\"Make it minits, too,\" said Totts; and this was done.\n\n\"Make it sekonds,\" said Maverick; and this was done.\n\nCottsill turned to Egghorn at the blackboard. \"Add eir, umble, otel, and\nistorical,\" said he.\n\n\"No, he sha'n't!\" cried Totts, fiercely.\n\n\"Are we phonetic or not?\" demanded Cottsill, turning on him.\n\n(\"You're a pack of geese,\" said Miss Appleby.)\n\n\"I never said umble in my life!\" shouted Totts.\n\n\"I reckon he don't use the aixpression,\" said Willows.\n\n\"And if istorical is adopted, I'll resign now,\" Totts continued.\n\n\"Gentlemen, gentlemen,\" protested Kibosh.\n\n\"I move those last h's be laid on the table,\" said Maverick; and this\nwas done.\n\n\"Past participles,\" Egghorn now wrote on the blackboard. \"Termination\n_ed_ to be changed to _t_; for instance, blest, exprest, dro----\"\n\n\"What are you going to do with rest?\" interrupted Totts.\n\n\"And test?\" said some one down the table.\n\n\"And nest?\" another called out.\n\n\"Can't you let him finish?\" said Cottsill. And Egghorn continued,\n\"Dropt, stopt, spilt, kilt, and so forth.\"\n\n(\"Kilt!\" whispered Miss Appleby. \"Oh, dear!\")\n\n\"Rattlet instead of rattled will look funny,\" observed some one.\n\n\"So will mart and wart,\" remarked Willows, \"instead of marred and\nwarred.\"\n\n\"If you have rattlet and mart and wart,\" yelled Totts, \"I'll resign\nright now, right now, right now!\"\n\n\"Who thought of having them, having them, having them?\" thundered\nCottsill.\n\n\"Gentlemen! Oh, Gentlemen!\" wailed Kibosh.\n\n\"But consistency----\" objected Maverick.\n\n\"You cut out consistency yourself,\" Cottsill reminded him. We despatched\nthe past participles, and came also without much disturbance through\ncatalog, demagog, and so forth (vogue and rogue made some trouble, and\nour fundamental principle of inconsistency had once more to be\nasserted), but when their blood was roused and the fire of\nsimplification grew hot in them, and they adopted the following with\ncheers and noises of feet----\n\n     Receev, deceev, conceev, beleev,\n     weev, leev, greev, seez, pleez, teez--\n\nI felt that we had really got near the weeding-out point, especially\nwhen Jesse Willows rose and added fleez. \"Plural of dogbiters,\" he\nexplained, and sat down quietly. At this Miss Appleby gave one brief,\nhappy laugh, but at once resumed a singular tapping of her foot which I\nhad begun to observe. We now thoroughly phoneticked many words: blud,\nfor instance, and wunss (which is so much phoneticker than once!) and\nthe days of the week: Munday, for instance, and Toozday. (I say Tewsday,\nmyself, but I did not mention it to these profound American scholars.)\n\n\"My little daughter Zola B.,\" said Professor Maverick, \"can always spell\nWednesday.\"\n\n\"My nine children never can,\" said Totts.\n\n\"I withdraw the objection,\" said Maverick; and so it was Wensday.\n\nSkwirl, for squirrel, was next agreed upon, and lepard, and eegl. And as\nthe blood of the scholars grew ever hotter and hotter, Constitooshun,\nDeklarayshun, and United Staits were adopted.\n\n\"But my Zola B.----\" began Maverick.\n\n\"What are you-all goin' to call yore next?\" asked Willows.\n\nMaverick sighed. \"My salary only affords----\"\n\n\"Beg yore pardon, suh, I forgot,\" said Willows, with sympathy.\n\nIt was here that I rose. \"Gentlemen,\" I said, \"let us do it right. Of\ncourse, English spelling is but a rag-bag of lawlessness.\"\n\n\"He has said that before,\" muttered Jesse Willows.\n\n\"But,\" I continued, \"the sun never sets on English spelling.\"\n\n\"I object to these constant, trivial interruptions,\" stated Cottsill.\n\n\"Yes, let us onward,\" urged the chairman.\n\n\"Play ball!\" added Totts.\n\n\"Chew gum!\" finished Cottsill.\n\n\"I'm through,\" Egghorn said, sitting down.\n\nIt was beyond my power to guide them. I also sat down. I also was\nthrough.\n\n\"Through?\" exclaimed Totts. \"That reminds me.\" And running to his\nblackboard he wrote:--\n\n     THRU\n\n\"What's that thing?\" asked Willows.\n\n\"Hup, hup,\" began Egghorn.\n\n\"Through,\" replied Totts, raising his voice.\n\n\"_What_?\" said Willows, raising his voice, too.\n\n\"Through, through!\" answered the convention in a body.\n\nAnd Miss Appleby, amid the general din, remarked, \"That's the way a pig\nwould spell if it got the chance.\"\n\n\"Thru, clu, blu, nu, hu,\" wrote Totts.\n\n\"Hu? Hu?\" repeated Willows, vacantly; \"what's hu?\"\n\n\"Hup, hup, hup,\" vainly continued Egghorn, waving his arms.\n\n\"Hu's who,\" explained Cottsill, loudly.\n\n\"Who, who!\" explained the whole convention to Willows.\n\n\"Booh, pooh!\" said Willows. And running to the blackboard he added:\n\n\"Bu, pu, and stu, also glu.\"\n\nBut Egghorn was now standing on his chair, and screaming, \"Hup, hup,\nhup,\" with the most energetic violence.\n\n\"Oh, write it!\" every one cried out to him.\n\nThey lifted Egghorn down from his chair, and he ran eagerly to his\nblackboard, upon which he wrote, \"This is illiterate, this is\nunscholarly.\"\n\nAnd again the convention cried out together, \"We're not here to be\nscholarly, we're not here to be literate.\"\n\n\"Have yore way, gennlemen,\" said Jesse Willows, \"I'll stand for\nanything.\"\n\n\"Well, I can't stand this any longer!\" exclaimed Miss Appleby; and\nrising to her pretty feet, she continued, \"Gentlemen, in your charitable\nsolicitude for foreigners, you may be making our spelling easy for\nLithuanians (though I doubt it), but you are making it quite impossible\nfor the English.\"\n\nUpon this a cold silence fell, and then, \"And who are the English,\nmadam?\" asked Cottsill.\n\nMiss Appleby gave her delightful brief laugh. \"I'm sorry you don't know,\nsir,\" said she, \"for I didn't come here to begin your education.\" And\nshe sat down. There was an impulse in me to call her Gertrude, but I\nfelt it to be premature.\n\nA general murmuring confusion of consulting and dissenting voices now\narose among the scholars.\n\n\"But what did you come here for?\" I asked Miss Appleby.\n\n\"Not to see unbroken dogs put their muddy paws all over the greatest\nlanguage in the world,\" she retorted.\n\n\"Dear me, dear me,\" I returned, with soothing deprecation, for she was\nplainly very much incensed, \"then what did you come for?\"\n\n\"Oh, for reasons,\" she returned evasively.\n\nDoubts that I could not define began suddenly to fill my mind, and I\nsaid to her, \"Didn't you write about Shakespeare?\"\n\n\"A college joke,\" she answered contemptuously. \"I'm writing a poem now.\nI shall call it, 'How we brought the Good Spelling from Ghent to Aix.'\"\n\n\"Then you don't believe in the Higher Spelling?\" I asked.\n\n\"No!\" she declared, with defiance.\n\n\"Does Professor Willows?\" I pursued.\n\n\"Hadn't you better ask him about that?\" she replied.\n\nI think my face must have turned the reddest that anger can paint faces;\nfor now, at any rate, I had no doubts as to how I had been made game of\nin the private car. Yes, they had mocked me. The impudent young man had\nmanufactured absurd spelling for my serious attention, and he and Miss\nAppleby had then made merry together over it, and over myself. But\nbefore I could frame a fitting rebuke to the frivolous though lovely\nyoung woman beside me, a distracting hubbub of voices was set up, and\nthrough this I heard Kibosh calling:--\n\n\"On your blackboards, gentlemen, on your blackboards.\"\n\nThe convention gradually heard him, too, and scholar after scholar\nbounded from his chair, seized a piece of chalk, and began to write.\nOnly one was left, who stood at his place, pouring forth the most\nexecrable sounds I have ever heard.\n\n\"Professor Dudelsacker has the floor,\" said Kibosh.\n\n\"Burrmeowskreeyiyiwurrburrwowwowmeow,\" went the professor.\n\n\"Turn that Central Pennsylvania Dutch quacker out!\" shouted some one.\n\n\"I've resigned already meowowwow,\" squealed Dudelsacker, in a fury; and\nhe took his departure at once.\n\nBut this brought us no calm. Twenty pieces of chalk were rattling on\nthe blackboards like a platoon of busy telegraphic instruments. Each\nscholar was making his own list for the new dictionary of English, and I\nread the lists of Totts, Maverick, and Cottsill, so far as they had\nwritten them. Jesse Willows was writing, too, with sweeping flourishes;\nbut I had ceased to place faith in his integrity.\n\n     Surracuse     Beverly Fahms     Cyar\n     Yurrup        Rud               Cyard\n     Surrup        But               Cyart\n     Mawrul        Cut               Gyarden\n     Sawrul        Grantha           Coat-house\n     Kwawrul       Anywheres}\n     Awringe       Everywheres}      _Cottsill's list_\n     Amurrican     Nowheres}\n     Tremenjus     Tremendious}\n\n\"Awringe,\" I murmured aloud, in ignorance of its meaning; but my own\nvoice revealed to me that it was our chief Florida fruit, as pronounced\nby Lysander Totts, of Numa Pompilius, New York, discoverer of\nCleopatra's true sex. The whole great West was rattling away on the\nboards behind me, but what I saw in front of me was enough to hold my\nattention; and my eyes were straying back and forth between awringe and\ngrantha, when Totts, happening to glance up from his work, beheld the\nwork of Maverick next him.\n\nHe stopped abruptly. \"Rud?\" he inquired of the professor from Fishball\nUniversity, author of Pecan Nuts.\n\n\"Road,\" explained Maverick, writing out the old spelling. \"Road, boat,\ncoat.\"\n\n\"Hm,\" said Totts, with disapprobation.\n\n\"But what is grantha?\" I whispered to Miss Appleby.\n\n\"Can it be a breakfast food?\" she suggested; and again I wished to call\nher Gertrude.\n\nTotts was still gazing at Maverick's list. \"Hm. Yes,\" he repeated. \"Bean\ntalk from Boston. We don't want it.\"\n\n\"Are we phonetic or not?\" returned Maverick, sharply.\n\nBut Totts had now caught sight of Cottsill's list. \"Anywheres?\" he read\naloud. \"Why anywheres? Rub all those out.\"\n\n\"I will not,\" declared the author of Nostalgia in the Lobster. \"I guess\nif you can be phonetic, I can.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid they're skipping grantha,\" said Miss Appleby.\n\n\"Who says anywheres?\" demanded Totts.\n\n\"I do,\" snapped Cottsill.\n\n\"Well, I don't,\" Totts replied. \"And, what's more, I won't.\"\n\nCottsill raised his voice. \"I guess I can be phonetic just as----\"\n\n\"Anywheres is vulgar,\" interrupted Totts.\n\n\"Vulgar yourself!\" screamed Cottsill, jumping up and down.\n\n\"Vulgar! Vulgar!\" chimed in Maverick, whom the term bean talk had\nnettled.\n\nBut Totts had spied the list of Jesse Willows, and was pointing at it\ndisdainfully. \"And pray,\" said he, \"what may a coat-house be?\"\n\nNow the handsome young man from Paw-paw was the last person to select\nfor addressing in such a tone as Lysander Totts had taken.\n\n\"I beg yore pardon, suh?\" he remarked, so politely that I became filled\nwith apprehension.\n\nMiss Appleby was gazing at him with all her eyes. \"What do you think of\nhim?\" she whispered to me.\n\nI suppose that indignation at his unwarrantable treatment of me in the\ncar rendered me imprudent. \"My dear Miss Appleby,\" I said to her, \"my\ndear Gertrude, he is as beautiful as the day, as ignorant as a\nSocialist, and as dishonest as a plumber.\"\n\n\"How dare you speak of my husband so?\" she replied. \"We were married\nthis morning. That's all we came for to your silly convention. Good-by.\"\nAnd rising, she swept out of the room.\n\nBut her exit was unobserved. The great West was still rattling on its\nblackboards, Maverick and Cottsill were scowling darkly at Totts. Totts\nwas pointing one finger at coat-house, and Willows was smiling steadily\nat Totts, in a manner that now convinced me we were approaching the edge\nof something quite particular. Nor did even the bridegroom know that his\nbride had left us.\n\n\"I beg yore pardon, suh?\" he repeated.\n\n\"Coat-house. What's that?\" said Totts.\n\n\"It is whah they'd have you, suh, if they caught you teachin' any o'\nthose railroad accidents o' yore's to the young.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed; yes, indeed!\" cried Maverick and Cottsill, eagerly.\n\nTotts loudly blew his nose. \"It shall remain court-house in the\ndictionary of scholars,\" he remarked.\n\nWillows ran his eye up and down Totts' list, and then up and down Totts.\n\"Schooling,\" he softly returned, \"has done powerful little for the\nAmurrican who sails to Yurrup and puts surrup on his hot cakes.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed; yes, indeed!\" said Cottsill and Maverick again.\n\n\"Gentlemen, gentlemen!\" pleaded Kibosh, \"do not quarrel.\"\n\n\"Kwawrul, you mean,\" smiled Jesse Willows. \"It's immawrul to kwawrul in\nSurracuse, Noo Yorruk.\"\n\nTotts now began to show signs of jumping up and down.\n\n\"Have we adopted phonetic spelling, or have we not?\" he roared.\n\n\"Not yore kind,\" said Willows.\n\n\"Yore!\" echoed Totts. \"Listen to that dialect!\" And he blew his noise\nmore loudly.\n\n\"Hup, hup,\" began Egghorn; but his voice stuck as usual.\n\n\"You should get a chauffeur,\" said Cottsill, severely, to him.\n\n\"Hup, hup. Compromise,\" finished Egghorn.\n\n\"Ah, yes, gentlemen, there we have it!\" said Kibosh, earnestly.\n\"Compromise is progress. Let us all accept one another. Thus the cause\nwill profit.\"\n\nHis exhortation produced a brief, a very brief, lull. Each looked at the\nneighboring blackboards in silence; and Kibosh, doubtless with the idea\nof harmony, set the organ once more to playing, \"My spelling 'tis of\nthee,\" while the rattling West continued to create a new language behind\nus.\n\nAt length Cottsill sighed. \"Very well,\" he said, \"for the sake of\nanywheres, I'll vote for surrup.\"\n\n\"That's wise, that's kind, that's good,\" said Kibosh; and he beat one\nhand gently on the table.\n\nAt this hopeful point, Jesse Willows noticed, for the first time, that\nno lady was now present, and his long body made a singular twisting and\nfree motion beneath his clothes.\n\n\"I will vote for rud and anywheres,\" Totts said. \"But I doubt if I can\naccept coat-house.\"\n\nJesse Willows took him instantly by the nose. \"You'll accept nothin',\"\nsaid he, with great sweetness; and he shook him forward and back. \"I am\nweary of you and yore antics,\" and he shook him right and left. \"You're\ngoin' to rub out everything you have written,\" and he shook him round\nand round.\n\n\"Help,\" gurgled the struggling Totts. \"Help!\"\n\n\"No, indeed; no, indeed,\" cried Maverick and Cottsill, delighted.\n\n\"You gentlemen are included,\" said Willows to them, and they both\nhastily covered their noses with their hands. \"I don't mean that way,\"\nhe continued. \"But you're goin' to rub yore lists out, too. Why, you're\nthe contemptiblest of all the great American frauds. Just because you\nhave written a picayune book on some picayune specialty, you pass for\nbein' educated in our half-civilized country. Put you among genuine\nscholars and you would look like old gum shoes. I know my accent is\nprovincial,\" he paused and looked at Totts for a moment, \"but it's a\nheap prettier'n yore's,\" he shook Totts round and round again, \"and you\nand I are just goin' to let the English language take care of herself.\nShe has done it for a thousand years, and she'll do it for a thousand\nmore, changin' what she pleases an' keepin' what she pleases.\"\n\nSo saying, the young man, even as one drags a resisting dog by a chain,\ndragged the howling Totts by his nose to the blackboard, and forced the\nrubber into his hand; and as Totts hung back his firmly imprisoned organ\nreceived a still more acute sensation, whereat he leaped into the air,\nand erased his Surracuse list at one sweep. And next, since Cottsill and\nMaverick were hanging back also, one with his arms shielding grantha,\nwhile the other shielded anywheres, Totts was conducted to those words.\n\"Out with grantha,\" commanded Jesse. \"We'll keep it grandfather for a\nwhile yet, Mr. Bean Talk.\" They attempted to defend their lists, but\nvainly; and in the conflict that arose, a rubber flew crooked and hit\none of the great West sharply in the back of the neck. He, being under a\nmisapprehension, thereupon kicked his neighbor savagely, and in a moment\nall the profound scholars engaged together in a blind war, rubbing out\none another's lists, whacking one another's heads, and often rolling\nby twos and threes beneath the table, from which dictionaries and\ninkstands were falling continuously. It was with the greatest difficulty\nthat I got the gasoline organ between myself and harm's way. Jesse\nWillows had mounted upon the table with the still faintly bellowing\nTotts, whom he led slowly from one end to the other, amid the clouds of\nchalk and the general bedlam.\n\nAt the first pause which exhaustion brought, Masticator B. Fellows was\nperceived to be looking on quietly.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"dear friends\" (and these words stopped\neverything), \"I am well pleased with what you have accomplished. I\nexpected results, and I have got them. The surgeon awaits you in the\nHouse of Bandages.\"\n\nNo serious wounds were found; but also no scholar was found to be upon\nspeaking terms with any other. By the generosity of Masticator each was\nsent home separately in a private car, on a special train, with plenty\nof chickle.\n\nMasticator had created all the publicity that he desired. New students\nswarmed in armies to his University, and he presently issued a billion\nmore shares of Chickle common. The press of the whole country rang with\nthe enterprise.\n\n     SIMPLE SPELLERS WED\n\nwas one of the first headlines that greeted me upon my homeward journey.\nYes; Jesse Willows and Gertrude Appleby were the exceptions; these two\nscholars had gone away in the same car together to their honeymoon,\nwhile I returned lonely to the index of my forthcoming volume.\n\nHeigho!",
