    "body": "There were thirty or more of the little girls, their ages ranging\napparently from nine to eleven, all of them chirping away like a flock\nof chicks as they followed the old mother hen past the line of cages.\n\"Now, now, girls,\" called Miss Burton cheerily. \"Don't scatter. I can't\nkeep my eye on you if you get too far away from me. You, Hilda, give me\nthat water pistol. No, don't fill it up first at that fountain. And\nFrances, stop bouncing your ball. You'll lose it through the bars, and a\npolar bear may get it and not want to give it back.\"\n\nFrances giggled. \"Oh, Miss Burton, do you think the polar bear would\nwant to play catch?\"\n\nThe two men who were looking on wore pleased smiles. \"Charming,\" said\nManto. \"But somewhat unpredictable, despite all our experiences, _muy\namigo_.\"\n\n\"No attempts at Spanish, Manto, not here. It calls attention to us. And\nyou are not sure of the grammar anyway. You may find yourself saying\nthings you do not intend.\"\n\n\"Sorry, Palit. It wasn't an attempt to show my skill, I assure you. It's\nthat by now I have a tendency to confuse one language with another.\"\n\n\"I know. You were never a linguist. But about these interesting\ncreatures--\"\n\n\"I suggest that they could stand investigation. It would be good to know\nhow they think.\"\n\n\"Whatever you say, Manto. If you wish, we shall join the little ladies.\"\n\n\"We must have our story prepared first.\"\n\nPalit nodded, and the two men stepped under the shade of a tree whose\nlong, drooping, leaf-covered branches formed a convenient screen. For a\nmoment, the tree hid silence. Then there came from beneath the branches\nthe chatter of girlish voices, and two little girls skipped merrily\naway. Miss Burton did not at first notice that now she had an additional\ntwo children in her charge.\n\n\"Do you think you will be able to keep your English straight?\" asked one\nof the new little girls.\n\nThe other one smiled with amusement and at first did not answer. Then\nshe began to skip around her companion and chant, \"I know a secret, I\nknow a secret.\"\n\nThere was no better way to make herself inconspicuous. For some time,\nMiss Burton did not notice her.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe polar bears, the grizzlies, the penguins, the reptiles, all were\nleft behind. At times the children scattered, but Miss Burton knew how\nto get them together again, and not one was lost.\n\n\"Here, children, is the building where the kangaroos live. Who knows\nwhere kangaroos come from?\"\n\n\"Australia!\" clanged the shrill chorus.\n\n\"That's right. And what other animals come from Australia?\"\n\n\"I know, Miss Burton!\" cried Frances, a dark-haired nine-year-old with a\npair of glittering eyes that stared like a pair of critics from a small\nheart-shaped face. \"I've been here before. Wallabies and wombats!\"\n\n\"Very good, Frances.\"\n\nFrances smirked at the approbation. \"I've been to the zoo lots of\ntimes,\" she said to the girl next to her. \"My father takes me.\"\n\n\"I wish my father would take me too,\" replied the other little girl,\nwith an air of wistfulness.\n\n\"Why don't you ask him to?\" Before the other little girl could answer,\nFrances paused, cocked her head slightly, and demanded, \"Who are you?\nYou aren't in our class.\"\n\n\"I'm in Miss Hassel's class.\"\n\n\"Miss Hassel? Who is she? Is she in our school?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said the other little girl uncertainly. \"I go to P. S.\n77--\"\n\n\"Oh, Miss Burton,\" screamed Frances. \"Here's a girl who isn't in our\nclass! She got lost from her own class!\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Really?\" Miss Burton seemed rather pleased at the idea that some other\nteacher had been so careless as to lose one of her charges. \"What's your\nname, child?\"\n\n\"I'm Carolyn.\"\n\n\"Carolyn what?\"\n\n\"Carolyn Manto. Please, Miss Burton, I had to go to the bathroom, and\nthen when I came out--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I know.\"\n\nA shrill cry came from another section of her class. \"Oh, Miss Burton,\nhere's another one who's lost!\"\n\nThe other little girl was pushed forward. \"Now, who are _you_?\" Miss\nBurton asked.\n\n\"I'm Doris Palit. I went with Carolyn to the bathroom--\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nMiss Burton made a sound of annoyance. Imagine losing _two_ children and\nnot noticing it right away. The other teacher must be frantic by now,\nand serve her right for being so careless.\n\n\"All right, you may stay with us until we find a policeman--\" She\ninterrupted herself. \"Frances, what are you giggling at now?\"\n\n\"It's Carolyn. She's making faces just like you!\"\n\n\"Really, Carolyn, that isn't at all nice!\"\n\nCarolyn's face altered itself in a hurry, so as to lose any resemblance\nto Miss Burton's. \"I'm sorry, Miss Burton, I didn't really mean to do\nanything wrong.\"\n\n\"Well, I'd like to know how you were brought up, if you don't know that\nit's wrong to mimic people to their faces. A big girl like you, too. How\nold are you, Carolyn?\"\n\nCarolyn shrank, she hoped imperceptibly, by an inch. \"I'm two--\"\n\nAn outburst of shrill laughter. \"She's two years old, she's two years\nold!\"\n\n\"I was going to say, I'm _to_welve. Almost, anyway.\"\n\n\"Eleven years old,\" said Miss Burton. \"Old enough to know better.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Miss Burton. And honest, Miss Burton, I didn't mean\nanything, but I'm studying to be an actress, and I imitate people, like\nthe actors you see on television--\"\n\n\"Oh, Miss Burton, please don't make her go home with a policeman. If\nshe's going to be an actress, I'll bet she'd love to see Curt George!\"\n\n\"Well, after the way she's behaved, I don't know whether I should let\nher. I really don't.\"\n\n\"Please, Miss Burton, it was an accident. I won't do it again.\"\n\n\"All right, if you're good, and cause no trouble. But we still have\nplenty of time before seeing Mr. George. It's only two now, and we're\nnot supposed to go to the lecture hall until four.\"\n\n\"Miss Burton,\" called Barbara Willman, \"do you think he'd give us his\nautograph?\"\n\n\"Now, children, I've warned you about that. You mustn't annoy him. Mr.\nGeorge is a famous movie actor, and his time is valuable. It's very kind\nof him to offer to speak to us, especially when so many grown-up people\nare anxious to hear him, but we mustn't take advantage of his kindness.\"\n\n\"But he likes children, Miss Burton! My big sister read in a movie\nmagazine where it said he's just crazy about them.\"\n\n\"I know, but--he's not in good health, children. They say he got jungle\nfever in Africa, where he was shooting all those lions, and\nrhinoceroses, and elephants for his new picture. That's why you mustn't\nbother him too much.\"\n\n\"But he looks so big and strong, Miss Burton. It wouldn't hurt him to\nsign an autograph!\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, it would,\" asserted one little girl. \"He shakes. When he has\nan attack of fever, his hand shakes.\"\n\n\"Yes, Africa is a dangerous continent, and one never knows how the\ndangers will strike one,\" said Miss Burton complacently. \"So we must all\nremember how bravely Mr. George is fighting his misfortune, and do our\nbest not to tire him out.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the bright light that flooded the afternoon breakfast table, Curt\nGeorge's handsome, manly face wore an expression of distress. He groaned\ndismally, and muttered, \"What a head I've got, what a head. How do you\nexpect me to face that gang of kids without a drink to pick me up?\"\n\n\"You've had your drink,\" said Carol. She was slim, attractive, and\nefficient. At the moment she was being more efficient than attractive,\nand she could sense his resentment. \"That's all you get. Now, lay off,\nand try to be reasonably sober, for a change.\"\n\n\"But those kids! They'll squeal and giggle--\"\n\n\"They're about the only audience in the world that won't spot you as a\ndrunk. God knows where I could find any one else who'd believe that your\nhand shakes because of fever.\"\n\n\"I know that you're looking out for my best interests, Carol. But one\nmore drink wouldn't hurt me.\"\n\nShe said wearily, but firmly, \"I don't argue with drunks, Curt. I just\ngo ahead and protect them from themselves. No drinks.\"\n\n\"Afterwards?\"\n\n\"I can't watch you the way a mother watches a child.\"\n\nThe contemptuous reply sent his mind off on a new tack. \"You could if we\nwere married.\"\n\n\"I've never believed in marrying weak characters to reform them.\"\n\n\"But if I proved to you that I could change--\"\n\n\"Prove it first, and I'll consider your proposal afterwards.\"\n\n\"You certainly are a cold-blooded creature, Carol. But I suppose that in\nyour profession you have to be.\"\n\n\"Cold, suspicious, nasty--and reliable. It's inevitable when I must deal\nwith such warm-hearted, trusting, and unreliable clients.\"\n\nHe watched her move about the room, clearing away the dishes from his\nmeager breakfast. \"What are you humming, Carol?\"\n\n\"Was I humming?\"\n\n\"I thought I recognized it--_All of Me, Why Not Take All of Me_? That's\nit! Your subconscious gives you away. You really want to marry me!\"\n\n\"A mistake,\" she said coolly. \"My subconscious doesn't know what it's\ntalking about. All I want of you is the usual ten per cent.\"\n\n\"Can't you forget for a moment that you're an agent, and remember that\nyou're a woman, too?\"\n\n\"No. Not unless you forget that you're a drunk, and remember that you're\na man. Not unless you make me forget that you drank your way through\nAfrica--\"\n\n\"Because you weren't there with me!\"\n\n\"--with hardly enough energy to let them dress you in that hunter's\noutfit and photograph you as if you were shooting lions.\"\n\n\"You're so unforgiving, Carol. You don't have much use for me, do\nyou--consciously, that is?\"\n\n\"Frankly, Curt, no. I don't have much use for useless people.\"\n\n\"I'm not entirely useless. I earn you that ten per cent--\"\n\n\"I'd gladly forego that to see you sober.\"\n\n\"But it's your contempt for me that drives me to drink. And when I think\nof having to face those dear little kiddies with nothing inside me--\"\n\n\"There should be happiness inside you at the thought of your doing a\ngood deed. Not a drop, George, not a drop.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe two little girls drew apart from the others and began to whisper\ninto each other's ears. The whispers were punctuated by giggles which\nmade the entire childish conversation seem quite normal. But Palit was\nin no laughing mood. He said, in his own language, \"You're getting\ncareless, Manto. You had no business imitating her expression.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Palit, but it was so suggestive. And I'm a very suggestible\nperson.\"\n\n\"So am I. But I control myself.\"\n\n\"Still, if the temptation were great enough, I don't think you'd be able\nto resist either.\"\n\n\"The issues are important enough to make me resist.\"\n\n\"Still, I thought I saw your own face taking on a bit of her expression\ntoo.\"\n\n\"You are imagining things, Manto. Another thing, that mistake in\nstarting to say you were two hundred years old--\"\n\n\"They would have thought it a joke. And I think I got out of that rather\nneatly.\"\n\n\"You like to skate on thin ice, don't you, Manto? Just as you did when\nyou changed your height. You had no business shrinking right out in\npublic like that.\"\n\n\"I did it skillfully. Not a single person noticed.\"\n\n\"_I_ noticed.\"\n\n\"Don't quibble.\"\n\n\"I don't intend to. Some of these children have very sharp eyes. You'd\nbe surprised at what they see.\"\n\nManto said tolerantly, \"You're getting jittery, Palit. We've been away\nfrom home too long.\"\n\n\"I am not jittery in the least. But I believe in taking due care.\"\n\n\"What could possibly happen to us? If we were to announce to the\nchildren and the teacher, and to every one in this zoo, for that matter,\nexactly who and what we were, they wouldn't believe us. And even if they\ndid, they wouldn't be able to act rapidly enough to harm us.\"\n\n\"You never can tell about such things. Wise--people--simply don't take\nunnecessary chances.\"\n\n\"I'll grant that you're my superior in such wisdom.\"\n\n\"You needn't be sarcastic, Manto, I _know_ I'm superior. _I_ realize\nwhat a godsend this planet is--you don't. It has the right gravity, a\nsuitable atmosphere, the proper chemical composition--everything.\"\n\n\"Including a population that will be helpless before us.\"\n\n\"And you would take chances of losing all this.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly, Palit. What chances am I taking?\"\n\n\"The chance of being discovered. Here we stumble on this place quite by\naccident. No one at home knows about it, no one so much as suspects that\nit exists. We must get back and report--and you do all sorts of silly\nthings which may reveal what we are, and lead these people to suspect\ntheir danger.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis time, Manto's giggle was no longer mere camouflage, but expressed\nto a certain degree how he felt. \"They cannot possibly suspect. We have\nbeen all over the world, we have taken many forms and adapted ourselves\nto many customs, and no one has suspected. And even if danger really\nthreatened, it would be easy to escape. I could take the form of the\nschool teacher herself, of a policeman, of any one in authority.\nHowever, at present there is not the slightest shadow of danger. So,\nPalit, you had better stop being fearful.\"\n\nPalit said firmly, \"Be careful, and I won't be fearful. That's all there\nis to it.\"\n\n\"I'll be careful. After all, I shouldn't want us to lose these children.\nThey're so exactly the kind we need. Look how inquiring they are, how\nunafraid, how quick to adapt to any circumstances--\"\n\nMiss Burton's voice said, \"Good gracious, children, what language _are_\nyou using? Greek?\"\n\nThey had been speaking too loud, they had been overheard. Palit and\nManto stared at each other, and giggled coyly. Then, after a second to\nthink, Palit said, \"Onay, Issmay Urtonbay!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nFrances shrilled triumphantly, \"It isn't Greek, Miss Burton, it's\nLatin--Pig-Latin. She said, 'No, Miss Burton.'\"\n\n\"Good heavens, what is Pig-Latin?\"\n\n\"It's a kind of way of talking where you talk kind of backwards. Like,\nyou don't say, _Me_, you say, _Emay_.\"\n\n\"You don't say, _Yes_, you say _Esyay_,\" added another little girl.\n\n\"You don't say, _You_, you say, _Ouyay_. You don't say--\"\n\n\"All right, all right, I get the idea.\"\n\n\"You don't say--\"\n\n\"That'll do,\" said Miss Burton firmly. \"Now, let's get along to the lion\nhouse. And please, children, do not make faces at the lions. How would\nyou like to be in a cage and have people make faces at you? Always\nremember to be considerate to others.\"\n\n\"Even lions, Miss Burton?\"\n\n\"Even lions.\"\n\n\"But Mr. George shot lots of lions. Was he considerate of them too?\"\n\n\"There is no time for silly questions,\" said Miss Burton, with the same\nfirmness. \"Come along.\"\n\nThey all trouped after her, Palit and Manto bringing up the rear. Manto\ngiggled, and whispered with amusement, \"That Pig-Latin business was\nquick thinking, Palit. But in fact, quite unnecessary. The things that\nyou do to avoid being suspected!\"\n\n\"It never hurts to take precautions. And I think that now it is time to\nleave.\"\n\n\"No, not yet. You are always anxious to learn details before reporting.\nWhy not learn a few more details now?\"\n\n\"Because they are not necessary. We already have a good understanding of\nhuman customs and psychology.\"\n\n\"But not of the psychology of children. And they, if you remember, are\nthe ones who will have to adapt. We shall be asked about them. It would\nbe nice if we could report that they are fit for all-purpose service, on\na wide range of planets. Let us stay awhile longer.\"\n\n\"All right,\" conceded Palit, grudgingly.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo they stayed, and out of some twigs and leaves they shaped the\nnecessary coins with which to buy peanuts, and popcorn, and ice cream,\nand other delicacies favored by the young. Manto wanted to win easy\npopularity by treating a few of the other children, but Palit put his\ngirlish foot down. No use arousing suspicion. Even as it was--\n\n\"Gee, your father gives you an awful lot of spending money,\" said\nFrances enviously. \"Is he rich?\"\n\n\"We get as much as we want,\" replied Manto carelessly.\n\n\"Gosh, I wish I did.\"\n\nMiss Burton collected her brood. \"Come together, children, I have\nsomething to say to you. Soon it will be time to go in and hear Mr.\nGeorge. Now, if Mr. George is so kind as to entertain us, don't you\nthink that it's only proper for us to entertain him?\"\n\n\"We could put on our class play!\" yelled Barbara.\n\n\"Barbara's a fine one to talk,\" said Frances. \"She doesn't even remember\nher lines.\"\n\n\"No, children, we mustn't do anything we can't do well. That wouldn't\nmake a good impression. And besides, there is no time for a play.\nPerhaps Barbara will sing--\"\n\n\"I can sing a 'Thank You' song,\" interrupted Frances.\n\n\"That would be nice.\"\n\n\"I can recite,\" added another little girl.\n\n\"Fine. How about you, Carolyn? You and your little friend, Doris. Can\nshe act too?\"\n\nCarolyn giggled. \"Oh, yes, she can act very well. I can act like people.\nShe can act like animals.\" The laughing, girlish eyes evaded a dirty\nlook from the little friend. \"She can act like _any_ kind of animal.\"\n\n\"She's certainly a talented child. But she seems so shy!\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Carolyn. \"She likes to be coaxed.\"\n\n\"She shouldn't be like that. Perhaps, Carolyn, you and Doris can do\nsomething together. And perhaps, too, Mr. George will be pleased to see\nthat your teacher also has talent.\"\n\n\"You, Miss Burton?\"\n\nMiss Burton coughed modestly. \"Yes, children, I never told you, but I\nwas once ambitious to be an actress too. I studied dramatics, and\nreally, I was quite good at it. I was told that if I persevered I might\nactually be famous. Just think, your teacher might actually have been a\nfamous actress! However, in my day, there were many coarse people on the\nstage, and the life of the theater was not attractive--but perhaps we'd\nbetter not speak of that. At any rate, I know the principles of the\ndramatic art very well.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"God knows what I'll have to go through,\" said Curt. \"And I don't see\nhow I can take it sober.\"\n\n\"I don't see how they can take you drunk,\" replied Carol.\n\n\"Why go through with it at all? Why not call the whole thing quits?\"\n\n\"Because people are depending on you. You always want to call quits\nwhenever you run into something you don't like. You may as well call\nquits to your contract if that's the way you feel.\"\n\n\"And to your ten per cent, darling.\"\n\n\"You think I'd mind that. I work for my ten per cent, Curt, sweetheart.\nI work too damn hard for that ten per cent.\"\n\n\"You can marry me and take it easy. Honest, Carol, if you treated me\nbetter, if you showed me I meant something to you, I'd give up\ndrinking.\"\n\nShe made a face. \"Don't talk nonsense. Take your outfit, and let's get\nready to go. Unless you want to change here, and walk around dressed as\na lion hunter.\"\n\n\"Why not? I've walked around dressed as worse. A drunk.\"\n\n\"Drunks don't attract attention. They're too ordinary.\"\n\n\"But a drunken lion hunter--that's something special.\" He went into the\nnext room and began to change. \"Carol,\" he called. \"Do you like me?\"\n\n\"At times.\"\n\n\"Would you say that you liked me very much?\"\n\n\"When you're sober. Rarely.\"\n\n\"Love me?\"\n\n\"Once in a blue moon.\"\n\n\"What would I have to do for you to want to marry me?\"\n\n\"Amount to something.\"\n\n\"I like that. Don't you think I amount to something now? Women swoon at\nthe sight of my face on the screen, and come to life again at the sound\nof my voice.\"\n\n\"The women who swoon at you will swoon at anybody. Besides, I don't\nconsider that making nitwits swoon is a useful occupation for a real\nman.\"\n\n\"How can I be useful, Carol? No one ever taught me how.\"\n\n\"Some people manage without being taught.\"\n\n\"I suppose I could think how if I had a drink inside me.\"\n\n\"Then you'll have to do without thinking.\"\n\nHe came into the room again, powerful, manly, determined-looking. There\nwas an expression in his eye which indicated courage without end, a\ncourage that would enable him to brave the wrath of man, beast, or\ndevil.\n\n\"How do I look?\"\n\n\"Your noble self, of course. A poor woman's edition of Rudolph\nValentino.\"\n\n\"I feel terrified. I don't know how I'm going to face those kids. If\nthey were boys it wouldn't be so bad, but a bunch of little girls!\"\n\n\"They'll grow up to be your fans, if you're still alive five years from\nnow. Meanwhile, into each life some rain must fall.\"\n\n\"You would talk of water, when you know how I feel.\"\n\n\"Sorry. Come on, let's go.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe lecture hall resounded with giggles. And beneath the giggles was a\nsteady undercurrent of whispers, of girlish confidences exchanged, of\ngirlish hopes that would now be fulfilled. Miss Burton's class was not\nthe only one which had come to hear the famous actor-hunter describe his\nbrave exploits. There were at least five others like it, and by some\nmistake, a class of boys, who also whispered to each other, in manly\nsuperiority, and pretended to find amusement in the presence of so many\nof the fairer sex.\n\nIn this atmosphere of giggles and whispers, Manto and Palit could\nexchange confidences without being noticed. Palit said savagely, \"Why\ndid you tell her that I could act too?\"\n\n\"Why, because it's the truth. You're a very good animal performer. You\nmake a wonderful dragon, for instance. Go on, Palit, show her what a\nfine dragon you can--\"\n\n\"Stop it, you fool, before you cause trouble!\"\n\n\"Very well, Palit. Did I tempt you?\"\n\n\"Did you tempt me! You and your sense of humor!\"\n\n\"You and your lack of it! But let's not argue now, Palit. Here, I think,\ncomes the lion-hunter. Let's scream, and be as properly excited as every\none else is.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy God, he thought, how can they keep their voices so high so long? My\neardrums hurt already. How do they stand a lifetime of it? Even an hour?\n\n\"Go ahead,\" whispered Carol. \"You've seen the script--go into your act.\nTell them what a hero you are. You have the odds in your favor to start\nwith.\"\n\n\"My lovely looks,\" he said, with some bitterness.\n\n\"Lovely is the word for you. But forget that. If you're good--you'll get\na drink afterwards.\"\n\n\"Will it be one of those occasions when you love me?\"\n\n\"If the moon turns blue.\"\n\nHe strode to the front of the platform, an elephant gun swinging easily\nat his side, an easy grin radiating from his confident, rugged face. The\ncheers rose to a shrill fortissimo, but the grin did not vanish. What a\ngreat actor he really was, he told himself, to be able to pretend he\nliked this.\n\nAn assistant curator of some collection in the zoo, a flustered old\nwoman, was introducing him. There were a few laudatory references to his\ngreat talents as an actor, and he managed to look properly modest as he\nlistened. The remarks about his knowledge of wild and ferocious beasts\nwere a little harder to take, but he took them. Then the old woman\nstepped back, and he was facing his fate alone.\n\n\"Children,\" he began. A pause, a bashful grin. \"Perhaps I should rather\nsay, my friends. I'm not one to think of you as children. Some people\nthink of me as a child myself, because I like to hunt, and have\nadventures. They think that such things are childish. But if they are,\nI'm glad to be a child. I'm glad to be one of you. Yes, I think I _will_\ncall you my friends.\n\n\"Perhaps you regard me, my friends, as a very lucky person. But when I\nrecall some of the narrow escapes I have had, I don't agree with you. I\nremember once, when we were on the trail of a rogue elephant--\"\n\nHe told the story of the rogue elephant, modestly granting a co-hero's\nrole to his guide. Then another story illustrating the strange ways of\nlions. The elephant gun figured in still another tale, this time of a\nvicious rhinoceros. His audience was quiet now, breathless with\ninterest, and he welcomed the respite from shrillness he had won for his\nears.\n\n\"And now, my friends, it is time to say farewell.\" He actually looked\nsad and regretful. \"But it is my hope that I shall be able to see you\nagain--\"\n\nScreams of exultation, shrill as ever, small hands beating\nenthusiastically to indicate joy. Thank God that's over with, he\nthought. Now for those drinks--and he didn't mean drink, singular. Talk\nof being useful, he'd certainly been useful now. He'd made those kids\nhappy. What more can any reasonable person want?\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut it wasn't over with. Another old lady had stepped up on the\nplatform.\n\n\"Mr. George,\" she said, in a strangely affected voice, like that of the\nfirst dramatic teacher he had ever had, the one who had almost ruined\nhis acting career. \"Mr. George, I can't tell you how happy you have made\nus all, young and old. Hasn't Mr. George made us happy, children?\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss Burton!\" came the shrill scream.\n\n\"And we feel that it would be no more than fair to repay you in some\nsmall measure for the pleasure you have given us. First, a 'Thank You'\nsong by Frances Heller--\"\n\nHe hadn't expected this, and he repressed a groan. Mercifully, the first\nsong was short. He grinned the thanks he didn't feel. To think that he\ncould take this, while sober as a judge! What strength of character,\nwhat will-power!\n\nNext, Miss Burton introduced another kid, who recited. And then, Miss\nBurton stood upright and recited herself.\n\nThat was the worst of all. He winced once, then bore up. You can get\nused even to torture, he told himself. An adult making a fool of herself\nis always more painful than a kid. And that affected elocutionist's\nvoice gave him the horrors. But he thanked her too. His good deed for\nthe day. Maybe Carol would have him now, he thought.\n\nA voice shrilled, \"Miss Burton?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear?\"\n\n\"Aren't you going to call on Carolyn to act?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I was forgetting. Come up here, Carolyn, come up, Doris.\nCarolyn and Doris, Mr. George, are studying how to act. They act people\n_and_ animals. Who knows? Some day they, too, may be in the movies, just\nas you are, Mr. George. Wouldn't that be nice, children?\"\n\nWhat the devil do you do in a case like that? You grin, of course--but\nwhat do you say, without handing over your soul to the devil? Agree how\nnice it would be to have those sly little brats with faces magnified on\nevery screen all over the country? Like hell you do.\n\n\"Now, what are we going to act, children?\"\n\n\"Please, Miss Burton,\" said Doris. \"I don't know how to act. I can't\neven imitate a puppy. Really I can't, Miss Burton--\"\n\n\"Come, come, mustn't be shy. Your friend says that you act very nicely\nindeed. Can't want to go on the stage and still be shy. Now, do you know\nany movie scenes? Shirley Temple used to be a good little actress, I\nremember. Can you do any scenes that she does?\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe silence was getting to be embarrassing. And Carol said he didn't\namount to anything, he never did anything useful. Why, if thanks to his\nbeing here this afternoon, those kids lost the ambition to go on the\nstage, the whole human race would have cause to be grateful to him. To\nhim, and to Miss Burton. She'd kill ambition in anybody.\n\nMiss Burton had an idea. \"I know what to do, children. If you can act\nanimals--Mr. George has shown you what the hunter does; you show him\nwhat the lions do. Yes, Carolyn and Doris, you're going to be lions. You\nare waiting in your lairs, ready to pounce on the unwary hunter. Crouch\nnow, behind that chair. Closer and closer he comes--you act it out, Mr.\nGeorge, please, that's the way--ever closer, and now your muscles\ntighten for the spring, and you open your great, wide, red mouths in a\ngreat, great big roar--\"\n\nA deep and tremendous roar, as of thunder, crashed through the\nauditorium. A roar--and then, from the audience, an outburst of\nterrified screaming such as he had never heard. The bristles rose at the\nback of his neck, and his heart froze.\n\nFacing him across the platform were two lions, tensed as if to leap.\nWhere they had come from he didn't know, but there they were, eyes\nglaring, manes ruffled, more terrifying than any he had seen in Africa.\nThere they were, with the threat of death and destruction in their\nfierce eyes, and here he was, terror and helplessness on his handsome,\nmanly, and bloodless face, heart unfrozen now and pounding fiercely,\nknees melting, hands--\n\nHands clutching an elephant gun. The thought was like a director's\ncommand. With calm efficiency, with all the precision of an actor\nplaying a scene rehearsed a thousand times, the gun leaped to his\nshoulder, and now its own roar thundered out a challenge to the roaring\nof the wild beasts, shouted at them in its own accents of barking\nthunder.\n\nThe shrill screaming continued long after the echoes of the gun's speech\nhad died away. Across the platform from him were two great bodies, the\nbodies of lions, and yet curiously unlike the beasts in some ways, now\nthat they were dead and dissolving as if corroded by some invisible\nacid.\n\nCarol's hand was on his arm, Carol's thin and breathless voice shook as\nshe said, \"A drink--all the drinks you want.\"\n\n\"One will do. And you.\"\n\n\"And me. I guess you're kind of--kind of useful after all.\"\n\nThis e-text was produced from Space Science Fiction February 1953.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\non this publication was renewed.]",
