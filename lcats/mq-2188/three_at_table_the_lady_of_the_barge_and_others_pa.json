Opinions\nranged from rank incredulity to childlike faith, one believer going so\nfar as to denounce unbelief as impious, with a reference to the Witch of\nEndor, which was somewhat marred by being complicated in an inexplicable\nfashion with the story of Jonah.\n\n\"Talking of Jonah,\" he said solemnly, with a happy disregard of the fact\nthat he had declined to answer several eager questions put to him on the\nsubject, \"look at the strange tales sailors tell us.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't advise you to believe all those,\" said a bluff, clean-shaven\nman, who had been listening without speaking much.  \"You see when a\nsailor gets ashore he's expected to have something to tell, and his\nfriends would be rather disappointed if he had not.\"\n\n\"It's a well-known fact,\" interrupted the first speaker firmly, \"that\nsailors are very prone to see visions.\"\n\n\"They are,\" said the other dryly, \"they generally see them in pairs, and\nthe shock to the nervous system frequently causes headache next morning.\"\n\n\"You never saw anything yourself?\"  suggested an unbeliever.\n\n\"Man and boy,\" said the other, \"I've been at sea thirty years, and the\nonly unpleasant incident of that kind occurred in a quiet English\ncountryside.\"\n\n\"And that?\"  said another man.\n\n\"I was a young man at the time,\" said the narrator, drawing at his pipe\nand glancing good-humouredly at the company.  \"I had just come back from\nChina, and my own people being away I went down into the country to\ninvite myself to stay with an uncle.  When I got down to the place I\nfound it closed and the family in the South of France; but as they were\ndue back in a couple of days I decided to put up at the Royal George,\na very decent inn, and await their return.\n\n\"The first day I passed well enough; but in the evening the dulness of\nthe rambling old place, in which I was the only visitor, began to weigh\nupon my spirits, and the next morning after a late breakfast I set out\nwith the intention of having a brisk day's walk.\n\n\"I started off in excellent spirits, for the day was bright and frosty,\nwith a powdering of snow on the iron-bound roads and nipped hedges, and\nthe country had to me all the charm of novelty.  It was certainly flat,\nbut there was plenty of timber, and the villages through which I passed\nwere old and picturesque.\n\n\"I lunched luxuriously on bread and cheese and beer in the bar of a small\ninn, and resolved to go a little further before turning back.  When at\nlength I found I had gone far enough, I turned up a lane at right angles\nto the road I was passing, and resolved to find my way back by another\nroute.  It is a long lane that has no turning, but this had several, each\nof which had turnings of its own, which generally led, as I found by\ntrying two or three of them, into the open marshes.  Then, tired of\nlanes, I resolved to rely upon the small compass which hung from my watch\nchain and go across country home.\n\n\"I had got well into the marshes when a white fog, which had been for\nsome time hovering round the edge of the ditches, began gradually to\nspread.  There was no escaping it, but by aid of my compass I was saved\nfrom making a circular tour and fell instead into frozen ditches or\nstumbled over roots in the grass.  I kept my course, however, until at\nfour o'clock, when night was coming rapidly up to lend a hand to the fog,\nI was fain to confess myself lost.\n\n\"The compass was now no good to me, and I wandered about miserably,\noccasionally giving a shout on the chance of being heard by some passing\nshepherd or farmhand.  At length by great good luck I found my feet on a\nrough road driven through the marshes, and by walking slowly and tapping\nwith my stick managed to keep to it.  I had followed it for some distance\nwhen I heard footsteps approaching me.\n\n\"We stopped as we met, and the new arrival, a sturdy-looking countryman,\nhearing of my plight, walked back with me for nearly a mile, and putting\nme on to a road gave me minute instructions how to reach a village some\nthree miles distant.\n\n\"I was so tired that three miles sounded like ten, and besides that, a\nlittle way off from the road I saw dimly a lighted window.  I pointed it\nout, but my companion shuddered and looked round him uneasily.\n\n\"'You won't get no good there,' he said, hastily.\n\n\"'Why not?' I asked.\n\n\"'There's a something there, sir,' he replied, 'what 'tis I dunno, but\nthe little 'un belonging to a gamekeeper as used to live in these parts\nsee it, and it was never much good afterward.  Some say as it's a poor\nmad thing, others says as it's a kind of animal; but whatever it is, it\nain't good to see.'\n\n\"'Well, I'll keep on, then,' I said.  'Goodnight.'\n\n\"He went back whistling cheerily until his footsteps died away in the\ndistance, and I followed the road he had indicated until it divided into\nthree, any one of which to a stranger might be said to lead straight on.\nI was now cold and tired, and having half made up my mind walked slowly\nback toward the house.\n\n\"At first all I could see of it was the little patch of light at the\nwindow. I made for that until it disappeared suddenly, and I found myself\nwalking into a tall hedge. I felt my way round this until I came to a\nsmall gate, and opening it cautiously, walked, not without some little\nnervousness, up a long path which led to the door. There was no light and\nno sound from within. Half repenting of my temerity I shortened my stick\nand knocked lightly upon the door.\n\n\"I waited a couple of minutes and then knocked again, and my stick was\nstill beating the door when it opened suddenly and a tall bony old woman,\nholding a candle, confronted me.\n\n\"'What do you want?' she demanded gruffly.\n\n\"'I've lost my way,' I said, civilly; 'I want to get to Ashville.'\n\n\"'Don't know it,' said the old woman.\n\n\"She was about to close the door when a man emerged from a room at the\nside of the hall and came toward us.  An old man of great height and\nbreadth of shoulder.\n\n\"'Ashville is fifteen miles distant,' he said slowly.\n\n\"'If you will direct me to the nearest village, I shall be grateful,' I\nremarked.\n\n\"He made no reply, but exchanged a quick, furtive glance with the woman.\nShe made a gesture of dissent.\n\n\"'The nearest place is three miles off,' he said, turning to me and\napparently trying to soften a naturally harsh voice; 'if you will give me\nthe pleasure of your company, I will make you as comfortable as I can.'\n\n\"I hesitated.  They were certainly a queer-looking couple, and the gloomy\nhall with the shadows thrown by the candle looked hardly more inviting\nthan the darkness outside.\n\n\"'You are very kind,' I murmured, irresolutely, 'but--'\n\n\"'Come in,' he said quickly; 'shut the door, Anne.'\n\n\"Almost before I knew it I was standing inside and the old woman,\nmuttering to herself, had closed the door behind me.  With a queer\nsensation of being trapped I followed my host into the room, and taking\nthe proffered chair warmed my frozen fingers at the fire.\n\n\"'Dinner will soon be ready,' said the old man, regarding me closely. 'If\nyou will excuse me.'\n\n\"I bowed and he left the room.  A minute afterward I heard voices; his\nand the old woman's, and, I fancied, a third.  Before I had finished my\ninspection of the room he returned, and regarded me with the same strange\nlook I had noticed before.\n\n\"'There will be three of us at dinner,' he said, at length. 'We two and\nmy son.'\n\n\"I bowed again, and secretly hoped that that look didn't run in the\nfamily.\n\n\"'I suppose you don't mind dining in the dark,' he said, abruptly.\n\n\"'Not at all,' I replied, hiding my surprise as well as I could, 'but\nreally I'm afraid I'm intruding. If you'll allow me--'\n\n\"He waved his huge gaunt hands. 'We're not going to lose you now we've\ngot you,' he said, with a dry laugh.  'It's seldom we have company, and\nnow we've got you we'll keep you.  My son's eyes are bad, and he can't\nstand the light.  Ah, here is Anne.'\n\n\"As he spoke the old woman entered, and, eyeing me stealthily, began to\nlay the cloth, while my host, taking a chair the other side of the\nhearth, sat looking silently into the fire.  The table set, the old woman\nbrought in a pair of fowls ready carved in a dish, and placing three\nchairs, left the room.  The old man hesitated a moment, and then, rising\nfrom his chair, placed a large screen in front of the fire and slowly\nextinguished the candles.\n\n\"'Blind man's holiday,' he said, with clumsy jocosity, and groping his\nway to the door opened it.  Somebody came back into the room with him,\nand in a slow, uncertain fashion took a seat at the table, and the\nstrangest voice I have ever heard broke a silence which was fast becoming\noppressive.\n\n\"'A cold night,' it said slowly.\n\n\"I replied in the affirmative, and light or no light, fell to with an\nappetite which had only been sharpened by the snack in the middle of the\nday.  It was somewhat difficult eating in the dark, and it was evident\nfrom the behaviour of my invisible companions that they were as unused to\ndining under such circumstances as I was.  We ate in silence until the\nold woman blundered into the room with some sweets and put them with a\ncrash upon the table.\n\n\"'Are you a stranger about here?' inquired the curious voice again.\n\n\"I replied in the affirmative, and murmured something about my luck in\nstumbling upon such a good dinner.\n\n\"'Stumbling is a very good word for it,' said the voice grimly.  'You\nhave forgotten the port, father.'\n\n\"'So I have,' said the old man, rising.  'It's a bottle of the\n\"Celebrated\" to-day; I will get it myself.'\n\n\"He felt his way to the door, and closing it behind him, left me alone\nwith my unseen neighbour.  There was something so strange about the whole\nbusiness that I must confess to more than a slight feeling of uneasiness.\n\n\"My host seemed to be absent a long time.  I heard the man opposite lay\ndown his fork and spoon, and half fancied I could see a pair of wild eyes\nshining through the gloom like a cat's.\n\n\"With a growing sense of uneasiness I pushed my chair back.  It caught\nthe hearthrug, and in my efforts to disentangle it the screen fell over\nwith a crash and in the flickering light of the fire I saw the face of\nthe creature opposite.  With a sharp catch of my breath I left my chair\nand stood with clenched fists beside it.  Man or beast, which was it?\nThe flame leaped up and then went out, and in the mere red glow of the\nfire it looked more devilish than before.\n\n\"For a few moments we regarded each other in silence; then the door\nopened and the old man returned.  He stood aghast as he saw the warm\nfirelight, and then approaching the table mechanically put down a couple\nof bottles.\n\n\"'I beg your pardon,' said I, reassured by his presence, 'but I have\naccidentally overturned the screen.  Allow me to replace it.'\n\n\"'No,' said the old man, gently, 'let it be.\n\n\"'We have had enough of the dark.  I'll give you a light.'\n\n\"He struck a match and slowly lit the candles.  Then--I saw that the man\nopposite had but the remnant of a face, a gaunt wolfish face in which one\nunquenched eye, the sole remaining feature, still glittered.  I was\ngreatly moved, some suspicion of the truth occurring to me.\n\n\"'My son was injured some years ago in a burning house,' said the old\nman.  'Since then we have lived a very retired life.  When you came to\nthe door we--' his voice trembled, 'that is-my son---'\n\n\"'I thought,\" said the son simply, 'that it would be better for me not to\ncome to the dinner-table.  But it happens to be my birthday, and my\nfather would not hear of my dining alone, so we hit upon this foolish\nplan of dining in the dark.  I'm sorry I startled you.'\n\n\"'I am sorry,' said I, as I reached across the table and gripped his\nhand, 'that I am such a fool; but it was only in the dark that you\nstartled me.'\n\n\"From a faint tinge in the old man's cheek and a certain pleasant\nsoftening of the poor solitary eye in front of me I secretly\ncongratulated myself upon this last remark.\n\n\"'We never see a friend,' said the old man, apologetically, 'and the\ntemptation to have company was too much for us.  Besides, I don't know\nwhat else you could have done.'\n\n\"'Nothing else half so good, I'm sure,' said I.\n\n\"'Come,' said my host, with almost a sprightly air.  'Now we know each\nother, draw our chairs to the fire and let's keep this birthday in a\nproper fashion.'\n\n\"He drew a small table to the fire for the glasses and produced a box of\ncigars, and placing a chair for the old servant, sternly bade her to sit\ndown and drink.  If the talk was not sparkling, it did not lack for\nvivacity, and we were soon as merry a party as I have ever seen.  The\nnight wore on so rapidly that we could hardly believe our ears when in a\nlull in the conversation a clock in the hall struck twelve.\n\n\"'A last toast before we retire,' said my host, pitching the end of his\ncigar into the fire and turning to the small table.\n\n\"We had drunk several before this, but there was something impressive in\nthe old man's manner as he rose and took up his glass.  His tall figure\nseemed to get taller, and his voice rang as he gazed proudly at his\ndisfigured son.\n\n\"'The health of the children my boy saved!' he said, and drained his\nglass at a draught.\"",
