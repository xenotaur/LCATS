    "body": "By B. M. Bower\n\nAuthor of \u201cThe Happy Family Stories,\u201d \u201cLonesome Land,\u201d Etc.\n\n\n    The reappearance of Olafson, the violinist, who had gone\n    out in the blizzard and was lost seeking the north wind\n    that he might learn the song it sang, and who, according\n    to Happy Jack, returned to earth on moonlight nights to\n    play his violin in the doorway of the deserted shack in\n    One Man Coulee.\n\n\nHappy Jack, by some freak of misguided ambition, was emulating\nrather heavily the elfish imagination of Andy Green. He was--to put\nit baldly and colloquially--throwing a big load into the Native Son\nwho jingled his gorgeous silver spurs close alongside Happy\u2019s more\nsoberly accoutered heel.\n\n\u201cThat there,\u201d Happy was saying, with ponderous gravity, \u201cis the\nshack where the old fiddler went crazy trying to play a tune like\nthe wind--or some blamed fool thing like that--and killed himself\nbecause he couldn\u2019t make it stick. It\u2019s haunted, that shack is. The\nold fellow\u2019s ghost comes around there moonlight nights and plays the\nfiddle in the door.\u201d\n\nThe Native Son, more properly christened Miguel, turned a languidly\nvelvet glance toward the cabin and flicked the ashes from his\ncigarette daintily. \u201cHave you ever seen the ghost, Happy?\u201d he asked\nindulgently.\n\n\u201cAh--yes, sure! I seen it m\u2019self,\u201d Happy lied boldly.\n\n\u201cAnd were you scared?\u201d\n\n\u201cMe? Scared? Hunh!\u201d Happy gave a fairly good imitation of dumb\ndisgust. \u201cWhy, I went and--\u201d\n\nHappy\u2019s imagination floundered in the stagnant pool of a\nslow-thinking brain.\n\n\u201cI went right in and--\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d Miguel smiled a smile of even, white teeth and ironical\nlips. \u201cSome moonlight night we will come back here at midnight, you\nand I. I have heard of that man, and I am fond of music. We will\ncome and listen to him.\u201d\n\nSome of the other boys, ambling up from behind, caught a part of the\nspeech, and looked at one another, grinning.\n\n\u201cThe Native Son\u2019s broke out all over with schoolbook grammar ag\u2019in,\u201d\nBig Medicine remarked. \u201cWonder what Happy\u2019s done? I\u2019ve noticed, by\ncripes, that the guilty party better duck, when that there Miguel\nbegins to talk like a schoolma\u2019am huntin\u2019 a job! Hey, there!\u201d he\nbellowed suddenly, so that one might hear him half a mile away.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this here music talk I hear? Who\u2019s goin\u2019 to play, and where\nat, and how much is it a head?\u201d\n\nMiguel turned and looked back at the group, smiling still. \u201cHappy\nwas telling me about a ghost in that cabin down there.\u201d He flung out\na hand toward the place so suddenly that his horse jumped in fear of\nthe quirt. \u201cI say we\u2019ll come back some night and listen to the\nghost. Happy says he frequently rides over to hear it play on\nmoonlight nights, and--\u201d\n\n\u201cAw, g\u2019wan!\u201d Happy Jack began to look uncomfortable in his mind. \u201cI\nsaid--\u201d\n\n\u201cHappy? If he thought there was a ghost in One Man Coulee, you\ncouldn\u2019t tie him down and haul him past in a hayrack at noon,\u201d Andy\nasserted sharply. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any ghost.\u201d\n\nAndy set his lips firmly together, and stared reminiscently down the\nhill at the lonely little cabin in the coulee. Memory, the original\nmoving-picture machine, which can never be equaled by any man-made\ncontrivance, flashed upon him vividly a picture of the night when he\nhad sat within that cabin, listening to the man who would play the\nnorth wind, and who wept because it eluded him always; who played\nwonderfully--a genius gone mad under the spell of his own music--and\nat last rushed out into the blizzard and was lost, seeking the north\nwind that he might learn the song it sang. The scene gripped Andy,\neven in memory. He wondered fancifully if Olafson was still\nwandering with his violin, searching for the home of the north wind.\nThey had never found him, not even when the snows had gone and the\nland lay bare beneath a spring sky. He must have frozen, for the\nnight had been bitter, and a blizzard raged blindingly. Still, they\nhad never found a trace of him.\n\nThere had been those who, after searching a while in vain, had\naccused Andy to his face of building the story to excite his\nfellows. He had been known to deceive his friends heartlessly, and\nthere had been some argument over the real fate of the vanished\nOlafson. If Andy had told the truth, asked the doubters, where was\nOlafson\u2019s body? And who had ever tried to play the wind? Who, save\nAndy Green, would ever think of such a fantastic tale? Happy Jack,\nAndy remembered resentfully, had been unusually vociferous in his\nunbelief, even for him.\n\n\u201cAw, you stuck to it there was all the makin\u2019s of a ghost,\u201d Happy\ndefended awkwardly, and wished that Andy Green had not overheard the\nyarn he told Miguel. \u201cSure, there\u2019s a ghost!\u201d He fell back a step\nthat he might wink at Big Medicine, and so enlist his sledge-hammer\nassistance. \u201cI leave it to Bud if we didn\u2019t hear it, one night---\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd seen it, too, by cripes!\u201d Big Medicine enlarged readily and\nshamelessly. \u201cStandin\u2019 right in the door, playin\u2019 the fiddle to beat\na straight flush.\u201d He glared around the little group with his\nprotruding eyes until his glance met the curious look of Cal Emmett.\n\u201cYou was with us, Cal,\u201d he asserted boldly. \u201cI leave it to you if we\ndidn\u2019t see \u2019im and hear \u2019im.\u201d\n\nCal, thus besought to bear false witness, did so with amiable\nalacrity. \u201cWe sure did,\u201d he declared.\n\n\u201cFunny you never said a word about it before,\u201d snapped Andy, with\nopen disbelief in his tone.\n\n\u201cWe thought nobody\u2019d believe us if we did tell it,\u201d Big Medicine\nexplained.\n\n\u201cPity yuh don\u2019t always think as close to the mark as yuh done then,\u201d\nAndy retorted.\n\n\u201cHow do yuh know there ain\u2019t a ghost?\u201d Big Medicine demanded with\nsome slight rancor, born not of the argument, but of temporary ill\nfeeling between the two. \u201cIs it because yuh know, by cripes, that\nyuh lied last winter?\u201d\n\nAndy\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about enough of that,\u201d he said,\nwith a flash of anger. With the cabin in sight, and recalling the\ntragedy of that night, he was not in the mood to wrangle\ngood-naturedly about it with any one--least of all with Big\nMedicine. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie. I\u2019m dead willing to back what I said about\nit with my fists, if--\u201d\n\nBig Medicine twitched the reins to ride close, but Miguel\u2019s horse\nsidled suddenly and blocked the move. Also, Miguel smiled\nguilelessly into the angry eyes of Big Medicine.\n\n\u201cWill you fellows come back with me to-night, then, and see the\nghost?\u201d he asked lightly. \u201cOr don\u2019t you dare tackle it again?\u201d\n\nBig Medicine snorted and forgot his immediate intentions toward\nAndy, just as Miguel, perhaps, intended that he should do.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dast come along, if we did,\u201d he glowered. \u201cI\u2019d camp\nthere alone for a month, far as I\u2019m concerned, if there was any\ngrub, by cripes!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat shows how much you know about the place,\u201d put in Pink, siding\nwith Andy. \u201cUnless somebody\u2019s packed it away lately, there\u2019s all\nkinds of grub left. Maybe the flour, and bacon, and beans is gone,\nbut there\u2019s enough pickles and stuffed olives to last--\u201d\n\n\u201cOlives!\u201d cried the Native Son, and looked back longingly at the\nrugged bluff which marked One Man Coulee. \u201cSay, does anybody belong\nto them olives?\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody but the ghost,\u201d grinned Pink. \u201cWe bought him twelve lovely\ntall bottles, just to please Jimmie; he told us there wasn\u2019t any\nsale for stuffed olives in Dry Lake, and he offered \u2019em to us at\ncost. We did think uh taking all he had, but we cut it down to\ntwelve bottles afterward. And Olafson never ate a darned olive all\nthe time he was there!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they\u2019re there yet, you say?\u201d It was plain that Miguel was far\nmore interested in the olives than he was in the ghost.\n\n\u201cSure, they\u2019re there.\u201d Pink was not troubling to warp the truth, as\nMiguel decided, after a sharp glance. \u201cThe stuff all belonged to\nOlafson, and the shack belongs to the Old Man. And when Olafson went\ncrazy over the wind, and froze to death,\u201d he stipulated distinctly,\nwith a challenging glance at Big Medicine, \u201cwe all kept thinking at\nfirst he\u2019d come back, maybe. But he never did--\u201d\n\n\u201cExceptin\u2019 his ghost, by golly!\u201d put in Slim unexpectedly, with a\nbelated snort of amusement at the idea.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather,\u201d sighed Miguel, \u201chave a dozen bottles of stuffed olives\nthan a dozen kisses from the prettiest girl in the State.\u201d\n\n\u201cMamma! they\u2019re easier to get, anyway. If you want \u2019em that bad--\u201d\n\n\u201cThat there ghost may have something to say about them olives,\u201d\nHappy Jack warned, sticking stubbornly to his story.\n\nMiguel smiled--and there was that in his smile which sent four\nmendacious cow-punchers hot with resentment.\n\n\u201cMaybe yuh don\u2019t believe in that ghost, by cripes?\u201d Big Medicine\nchallenged indignantly, and gave Miguel a pale, pop-eyed stare meant\nto be intimidating.\n\nMiguel smiled again as at some secret joke, and made no reply at\nall.\n\n\u201cWell--don\u2019t yuh b\u2019lieve it?\u201d Big Medicine roared after a minute.\n\nMiguel smiled gently and inspected his cigarette; emotions might\nsurge about this Native Son and beat themselves to a white froth\nupon the rock of his absolute, inimitable imperturbability, as the\nHappy Family knew well. Now they rode close-grouped, intensely\ninterested in this struggle between bull-bellowing violence and\nlanguid impassivity.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t believe it yourself, do you?\u201d Miguel inquired evenly at\nlast, rousing himself from his abstraction. \u201cDid you expect me to\nswallow hook, sinker, and all?\u201d\n\nBig Medicine looked positively murderous. \u201cWhen I say a thing is\nso,\u201d he cried, \u201cI expect, by cripes, that folks will take m\u2019 bare\nword for it. I don\u2019t have to produce no affidavies, nor haul in any\nwitnesses. I ain\u2019t like Andy, here. You\u2019re dealin\u2019 now with a man\nthat can look truth in the face and never bat an eye.\u201d\n\nMiguel smiled again, this time more humanly amused. \u201cI\u2019ve met men\nbefore who hadn\u2019t a speaking acquaintance with Dame Truth,\u201d he\ndrawled. \u201cThey looked her in the face, too--and she never recognized\n\u2019em.\u201d\n\nBig Medicine was at that critical point where make-believe may\neasily become reality. He had been \u201cjoshing\u201d and playing he was mad\nbefore; now his glare hardened perceptibly, so that more than one of\nthe boys noticed the difference.\n\n\u201cAw, if he don\u2019t want to believe it he don\u2019t have to,\u201d Happy Jack\nintercepted Big Medicine\u2019s belligerent speech. \u201cChances is them\nolives\u2019ll stay where they\u2019re at a good long while, though--if\nMig-u-ell has to get \u2019em after dark.\u201d\n\nMiguel smoked while he rode ten rods. \u201cI offered to come and listen\nto the ghost fiddle his fastest,\u201d he observed at last, \u201cand not one\nof you fellows took me up on it. To-night I\u2019ll come alone and get\nthose olives. I guess I can carry twelve bottles all right.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no use to-night,\u201d Cal Emmett objected. \u201cIt\u2019s only on moonlight\nnights--\u201d He looked a question at Big Medicine.\n\n\u201cMoonlight it\u2019s got to be. There ain\u2019t a moon till--\u201d\n\n\u201cI can find stuffed olives any old kind of a night.\u201d Miguel blew the\nashes from his cigarette. \u201cIt\u2019s the olives I want, amigo. I don\u2019t\ngive a whoop for your ghost.\u201d\n\n\u201cAw, I betche yuh dassent come when it\u2019s moonlight, just the same,\u201d\ncried Happy Jack. \u201cI betche ten dollars yuh dassent.\u201d\n\nIt would be tiresome to repeat all that was said upon the subject\nthereafter. So slight a thing as Happy Jack\u2019s wrongful desire to lie\nas convincingly as could Andy Green, led the whole Happy Family into\na profitless and more or less acrimonious argument. Each man,\naccording to his nature, and the mood he happened to be in at the\nmoment, took up the discussion. And speedily it developed that the\nfaction against Miguel, Andy Green, and Pink included every man of\nthem save Weary, who would stand by Pink regardless of the issue.\n\nIt was nearly noon, and they were hungry, and headed toward camp;\nbut despite their haste they argued the foolish question of whether\nthe cabin in One Man Coulee was haunted. Six of them maintained\nstubbornly that it was--for Irish began to side with Happy Jack just\nbecause he did not like the Native Son very well, and that ironical\nsmile of Miguel\u2019s irritated him to a degree; and Jack Bates also\nespoused the ghost because he scented an opportunity for excitement.\nThe minority, composed of Miguel, Pink, Andy Green, and Weary,\nconfined themselves largely to sarcasm--which is the oil which feeds\nfastest the flames of dissension.\n\nIt was foolish, to be sure; just as foolish as many other things\nwhich men drift into doing. But they, nevertheless, reached that\npoint where, as in the case of Big Medicine, make-believe crowded\nclose upon reality. The four rode together into camp ten paces ahead\nof the six, and they talked in low tones among themselves mostly.\nWhen they did deign to look at the six, their glances were\nunfriendly, and when they spoke their speech was barbed so that it\nstung the listeners. And the six retaliated vigorously--the more so\nbecause they had been silly enough in the first place to declare\ntheir belief in the nonexistent, and had been betrayed into making\nmany ridiculous assertions which they were too obstinate to\nwithdraw; so that once again the Happy Family belied the name men\nhad given it, and became for the time being a bunch of as\ndisagreeable cow-punchers as one could find in four days\u2019 ride.\n\n\u201cAw, say, I sure would like to put it on them fellers good!\u201d Happy\nJack growled to Cal and Jack Bates on the way to the corralled\nsaddle bunch after dinner. Happy Jack was purple with wrath, for a\ncaustic sentence or two spoken in Miguel\u2019s most maddening drawl was\nyet stinging his ears. \u201cThat there Native Son makes me tired! I\nwisht there was a ghost--I\u2019d sure--\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, there\u2019s a ghost, all right,\u201d Jack Bates stated meaningly; \u201call\nyuh got to do is make one.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, by golly!\u201d Slim, close behind them, gulped excitedly.\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it--\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, don\u2019t let them faces get to leaking,\u201d Cal advised bluntly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a whole week till the moon\u2019s good. Shut up!\u201d\n\nSlim goggled at him, caught the hazy beginning of an idea, grinned,\nand stepped over the rope into the corral. He was grinning when he\ncaught his horse, and he was still grinning widely while he cinched\nthe saddle. He caught Andy Green eying him suspiciously, and\nsnickered outright. But he did not say a word, and, therefore, went\nhis way, believing that he had given no hint of what was in his\nmind.\n\nSlim and Happy Jack were alike in one respect: Their minds worked\nslowly and rather ponderously--and, like other ponderous machinery,\nonce in motion they were hard to stop. The others would have left\nthe subject alone, after that hour of hot argument, and in time\nwould have forgotten it except for an occasional jeer, perhaps; but\nnot so Happy Jack and Slim.\n\nThe Flying U outfit ate, saddled fresh horses, reloaded the mess\nwagon, and moved on toward Dry Creek, and that night flung weary\nbodies upon the growing grass in the shade of the tents, twenty\nmiles and more from One Man Coulee and the little cabin with its\ngrim history of genius blotted out in madness. Nevertheless, Slim\nsearched ostentatiously with plate, knife, and fork in his hand, at\nsupper time, and craned his neck over boxes and cans, until he had\nthe attention of his fellows, who were hungry, and elbowed him out\nof their way with scant courtesy.\n\n\u201cSay, Mig-u-ell, where\u2019s them stuffed olives?\u201d he called at last. \u201cI\nthought, by golly, we was goin\u2019 to have some olives for supper?\u201d\n\n\u201cOlives--stuffed olives, are best picked by moonlight, they tell\nme,\u201d Miguel responded unemotionally, glancing up over his cup. \u201cHave\npatience, amigo.\u201d\n\nSlim nudged Happy Jack so that he spilled half his coffee and swore\nbecause it was hot, caught Big Medicine\u2019s pale-eyed glare upon him,\nand subsided so suddenly that he choked over his next sentence,\nwhich had nothing at all to do with olives, or ghosts, or insane\nfiddlers.\n\nMen, it would seem, never quite leave their boyhood behind them; at\nleast, those men do not who live naturally and individually,\nuntainted by the poison of the great money marts where human nature\nis warped and perverted so that nearly all natural instincts are\nsubordinated to the lust for gain of one sort and another. In the\nBear Paw country men labor for gain, it is true; but they also live\nthe lives for which nature has created them. There is that in the\nwide reaches of plain and valley, in the clean arch of blue sky and\ndrifting clouds overhead, which keeps the best of them boyish till\ntheir temples are marked with white--yes, and after.\n\nIt was that tenacious element which started Irish, Cal Emmett, Jack\nBates, and Big Medicine to tilting hat brims together when none\nothers were near observe them. It was that which sent them off\nriding by themselves--to town, they said before they started--early\non the first Sunday after the wagons had pulled in to the ranch,\nthere to stand until the beef round-up started.\n\nThey returned unobtrusively by mid-afternoon, and they looked very\nwell satisfied with themselves, and inclined to facetiousness.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Weary asked them pointedly when they dismounted\nat the corral. \u201cCome back after something you forgot?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah--sure,\u201d Cal returned, with a flicker of eyelids. \u201cNothing\ndoing in that darned imitation of a town, anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the mail?\u201d Pink demanded expectantly.\n\n\u201cWe--plumb forgot that there mail, by cripes!\u201d Big Medicine looked\nup quickly. \u201cIrish was goin\u2019 to git it, but he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nPink said nothing, but he studied the four from under the long,\ncurled lashed which he had found very useful in concealing covert\nglances.\n\n\u201cSorry, Little One--honest to grandma, I am!\u201d Big Medicine clapped\nhim patronizingly on the shoulder as he passed him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know as it matters,\u201d said Pink sweetly. \u201cSome of us were\njust about ready to hit the trail. We can get it, I guess. Say!\nAin\u2019t you got that cayuse caught up yet, Mig?\u201d he called out to the\nNative Son, who was reclining luxuriously against a new stack of\nsweet-smelling bluejoint hay. \u201cCome out of your trance, or we\u2019ll go\noff and leave you!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh--yuh going to town?\u201d Cal looked over his shoulder with some\nuneasiness in his baby-blue eyes.\n\n\u201cMaybe we are and maybe we ain\u2019t. Maybe we\u2019re going to see our best\ngirls. What\u2019s it to you?\u201d Pink turned his back on Cal and looked\nfull at Weary. \u201cCome on--the girls will be plumb wild if we don\u2019t\nget a move on,\u201d he said carelessly, and picked up his bridle.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Andy? I thought he said he wanted to go along. Hurry up,\nMig, if you\u2019re going.\u201d\n\nNobody knew what he was driving at, but the three were mounted well\nwithin ten minutes, and flinging back remarks to the four who had\nlately returned. The departing ones were well up on the hogback\nbefore any one of them ventured to question Pink, who rode with the\nair of one whose destination is fixed, and whose desire outstrips\nhis body in the journey.\n\n\u201cSay, Cadwolloper, where are we headed for?\u201d Weary inquired then\nresignedly. \u201cAnd what\u2019s the rush?\u201d\n\nPink glanced down the hill toward the stable and corrals, decided\nthat they were being observed with something very like suspicion,\nand faced to the front again. \u201cWe\u2019re going to head for Rogers\u2019,\u201d he\ndimpled, \u201cbut we ain\u2019t going to get there. Yuh needn\u2019t look down\nthere--but Irish and Cal are saddling up again. They\u2019re afraid we\u2019re\ngoing to town. They\u2019re going to trail us up and find out for sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey sure did act like they\u2019d been holding up a train, when they\nrode up,\u201d Weary observed. \u201cI\u2019ve been searching my soul with a\nspyglass trying to find the answer for all that guilt on their\nfaces.\u201d\n\n\u201cHappy Jack has been mentioning stuffed olives and moonlight pretty\noften to-day,\u201d the Native Son remarked with apparent irrelevance. \u201cI\nthought he\u2019d pickled that josh, but he\u2019s working things up again.\nTwo and two make four; that four.\u201d With the slightest of head tilts\nhe indicated those below, and flashed his even, white teeth in a\nsmile. \u201cDo you want me to guess where you\u2019re going, Pink?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish you fellows would guess how we\u2019re going to ditch them two\npirates, first,\u201d Pink retorted, glancing down again at the stable\nwithout turning his head. \u201cIf we strike straight for Rogers\u2019, maybe\nthey\u2019ll turn back, though. They\u2019ll think we\u2019ve gone over there to\nsee the girls.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I knew the country a little better--\u201d began the Native Son, and\nstopped with that.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t follow us over the ridge,\u201d spoke up Andy, who had\nbeen thinking deeply, \u201cwe can go up Antelope Coulee instead of down,\nand follow along in the edge of the breaks to the head of One Man,\nand down that; that\u2019s where you\u2019re going, isn\u2019t it? It will be five\nor six miles farther.\u201d\n\nPink threw up his hand impatiently. \u201cUh course, that\u2019s what I\nintended to do. But if they ride over the ridge they\u2019ll know we\nnever kept straight on to Rogers\u2019, and then they\u2019ll know we\u2019re\ndodging.\u201d He urged his horse up the last steep slope, and led the\nway over the brow of the bluff and out of sight of the ranch below.\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure going to find out what that bunch has been making\nthemselves so mysterious about, the last couple uh days,\u201d he vowed\ngrimly. \u201cI slipped up on \u2019em yesterday down in the hay corral, and I\nheard Cal say, \u2018Sure, we can! There\u2019s one in that Injun grave over\nin Antelope Coulee.\u2019\u201d He stared at the others with purpling eyes.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in that grave, Weary? I never was right to it, myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing, Cadwolloper--except what is left of the old boy they\ntucked under that ledge. There ain\u2019t even a perfume any more. We can\ngo by that way and see if they\u2019ve been there.\u201d\n\nWith that wordless understanding common among men who have lived\nlong together, they left the trail and ambled slowly across the\nprairie in the direction of the Rogers Ranch. And they had not\ntraveled more than half a mile when Miguel, looking back very\ncautiously, smiled.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look,\u201d he said, and then added melodramatically: \u201cWe are\nfollowed! Hist! The pursuers are in sight. Courage, men!\u201d\n\nPink risked a glance over his shoulder, and glimpsed two bobbing hat\ncrowns just over the brow of Flying U Coulee.\n\n\u201cNow, wouldn\u2019t that jar yuh?\u201d he exclaimed, just as disgustedly as\nif he had not all along suspected that very thing to happen.\n\nThe moving specks stopped, remained stationary for a minute or two,\nand then went bobbing back again. The four laughed, pressed spurred\nheels against their horses, and galloped over the ridge and into the\nlower end of Antelope Coulee. At the bottom they swung sharply to\nthe right, instead of to the left, rode as hurriedly as the uneven\nground would permit for a mile or more; crossed the trail to Dry\nLake, and kept on up the coulee to its very head.\n\nAt one point their quick eyes saw where several horsemen had ridden\ndown into the coulee, dismounted, and climbed through shale rock to\nthe lone Indian grave under a low shelf of sandstone, left there\nbetraying imprints of high-heeled boots, returned again to where\ntheir horses had waited, and ridden on. They also rode on, toward\nOne Man Coulee. Before them always lay the trail of shod hoofs,\nwhere the soil was not too hard to receive an imprint.\n\nPatsy was standing in the door of the mess house beating his fat\nknuckles upon a tin pan for the supper call, when Andy Green and\nMiguel rode leisurely down the grade. The boys were straggling\ntoward the sound, and there was the usual bustle around the\nwashbasins and roller towels, and in the quiet air hung the enticing\nodor of Patsy\u2019s delectable chicken potpie. The two hurried to the\nstable, unsaddled with the haste of hungry men, and reached the mess\nhouse just as the clatter of feet had subsided and the potpie was\nmaking its first round.\n\nCal looked up from a generous helping. \u201cHello, where\u2019s the rest of\nthe bunch?\u201d he queried.\n\n\u201cOh, the girls have got them roped and tied,\u201d Andy responded\ncarelessly. \u201cMig and I got cold feet, and broke back on them.\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t yuh go to town?\u201d Irish spoke as innocently as if he had not\nwatched them well on their way from the shelter of the bluff.\n\nMiguel deigned him one of his heavy-lidded stares. \u201cWhy should one\ngo to town, when there are three pretty girls at the next ranch?\nTown didn\u2019t hold you fellows very long.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought sure you\u2019d gone after olives, by golly,\u201d blurted Slim,\nwith his mouth half full of dumpling.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019d gone after them, I\u2019d have got them,\u201d Miguel, usually so\nexasperatingly calm, spoke with some feeling.\n\n\u201cAw, g\u2019wan! I betche yuh dassent go.\u201d Happy Jack grinned arrogantly.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t bet anything but words,\u201d retorted Miguel. \u201cThere are\nseveral of you fellows that seem to be just that brand of sports.\u201d\nHe gave the faint shrug which they all hated.\n\nBig Medicine laid down his knife and fork. \u201cSay, do yuh mind naming\nover them several fellers?\u201d he inquired abruptly in his booming\nvoice. \u201cI don\u2019t bet words, by cripes--when I bet--\u201d\n\nMiguel smiled across at him blandly. \u201cWe were speaking of olives,\u201d\nhe purred \u201cHappy Jack wanted to \u2018betche\u2019 I daren\u2019t go after them. He\ndidn\u2019t name the stakes, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t because I ain\u2019t willin\u2019 to put \u2019em up,\u201d glowered Happy.\n\u201cI\u2019ll betche five dollars, then--if that suits yuh any better.\u201d\n\nMiguel laughed, which was unusual when he was arguing with any one.\n\u201cDo you mean it? Do you really think that little, weak,\npretty-pretty ghost story would scare--a--nigger baby?\u201d His voice\ntaunted the lot of them.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t yuh believe there\u2019s a ghost, by cripes?\u201d Big Medicine bawled\npugnaciously.\n\n\u201cNo. Of course I don\u2019t believe it. Neither do you.\u201d Miguel spoke\nwith that weary tolerance which is so hard to endure.\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d Cal Emmett declared flatly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m willing to bet a horse\nagainst them fancy spurs of yours that you dassent go to-night to\nOne Man Coulee and bring away them bottles of stuffed olives.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat horse?\u201d asked Miguel, reaching for the chicken platter.\n\n\u201cWell--any darned horse I own!\u201d Cal wore the open-eyed look of\ninnocence which had helped him scare out his opponents in many a\npoker game. \u201cI say to-night,\u201d he added apologetically to the others,\n\u201cbecause it\u2019s going to be clear and lots uh moonlight; and it\u2019s\nSunday. But I don\u2019t care what night he tries it. I\u2019ll bet he won\u2019t\nbring away no olives.\u201d\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t they there?\u201d Miguel wanted to know.\n\n\u201cOh--they\u2019re there, I guess. I\u2019ll change the wordin\u2019 a little. I\u2019ll\nbet yuh dassent go to that shack, and go into it and stay long\nenough to freeze onto twelve bottles uh anything. To-night,\u201d he\nadded, \u201cat mid--no, any old time between ten and one. And I\u2019ll bet\nany one uh my four cayuses against your spurs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a go. Does the rest of my riding outfit look good to any of\nyou fellows?\u201d Miguel glanced around the table smilingly. \u201cHappy, for\ninstance--\u201d\n\n\u201cI got five dollars up,\u201d Happy Jack reminded. \u201cBut I\u2019ll put twenty\nwith it against your bridle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat bridle\u2019s worth fifty dollars. And my saddle cost two hundred\nand eighty. I\u2019ll put them up, though, if any one wants to cover the\nbet.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, this is a shame. Honest to grandma, I\u2019d hate to see Miggie\nridin\u2019 bareback the rest uh the summer--with a rope hackamore, by\ncripes! Don\u2019t go \u2019n take all his purty-purties away from him like\nthat, boys! Haw-haw-haw!\u201d It is unwise to laugh like that with one\u2019s\nmouth full of chicken. Big Medicine choked and retired from the\nconversation and the room.\n\n\u201cSay, you don\u2019t reelize, by golly, what you\u2019re up ag\u2019inst,\u201d Slim\nobserved ponderously. \u201cIf you did--\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you dead-game sports, or are you a bunch of old women?\u201d drawled\nMiguel. \u201cMy outfit is up, if any one has nerve enough to take the\nbets.\u201d\n\nThey wrangled more or less amicably over it, as was their habit. But\nthey did finally bet a great deal more on the foolish venture than\nthey should have done. When, finally, they reached the time and the\npoint of departure, Miguel, like the plains Indians during the fever\nof horse-racing, was pledged to his hat and his high-heeled boots;\nwhile the Happy Family, if they lost, would have plenty of reason to\nrepent them of their rashness.\n\nThey waited an hour for Pink and Weary to return, and, when they did\nnot appear, they rode off without them. They pitied Miguel, and told\nhim so. They told of haunted cabins, and of murders and dreams come\ntrue, and of disasters that were weird.\n\nAndy Green, when half of the ten miles had been covered, roused\nhimself from his disapproving silence and told them a fearsome tale\nof two miners murdered mysteriously and thrown into their own mine,\nand of their dog which howled up and down the mountain gulches when\nthe moonlight lay soft upon the land; told it so that they rode\nclose-huddled that they might catch it all, down to the last\ngruesomely mysterious incident of the murdered master whistling from\nthe pit to the dog, and of the animal\u2019s whimpering obedience--long\nyears after, when the dog\u2019s bones were bleaching through sun and\nstorm above, and the master\u2019s bones were rotting in the darkness\nbelow.\n\nHappy Jack more than once glanced uneasily toward the shadowy\nhollows as they rode slowly across the prairies through the night\nsilence. Slim set his jaw and rode stiffly, staring straight ahead\nof him as if he feared what he might see, if he looked aside. Miguel\nwas seen to shiver, though the air was soft and warm.\n\n\u201cNow, this Olafson--\u201d Andy began after a silence which no one\nthought to break. \u201cThe boys joshed me a lot about that. But it was\nqueer--the queerest thing I ever saw or heard. To see him sitting\nthere in the firelight, listening--and while he listened, to hear\nthe wind whoo-whoo around the corners and down the chimney--and the\nsnow swish-swishing against the walls like grave clothes when the\nghosts walk--\u201d\n\n\u201cAw--I thought yuh said there wasn\u2019t any ghosts!\u201d croaked Happy Jack\nuneasily.\n\n\u201cAnd then Olafson would lift his violin and draw the bow across--\u201d\n\nAndy, the reins dropped upon the saddle horn, held an imaginary\nviolin cuddled under his chin, and across the phantom strings drew\nan imaginary bow with slow, sweeping gestures, while his voice went\non with the tale, and the Happy Family watched, and listened, and\nsaw what he meant them to see. \u201cAnd then would come that lonesome\nwhoo-oo of the wind--from the violin. He made me see things. He made\nme see the storm, like it was a white spirit creeping over the\nrange. He made me see--\u201d\n\nThey had reached One Man Coulee while he talked. The Happy Family\nstared down into the lonely place lying nakedly white under the\nmoon, shivered, and rode slowly down the slope. Like one in a trance\nAndy rode in their midst, and compelled them with his voice to see\nthe things he would have them see. Compelled them to see Olafson,\nthe master musician, striving after the song of the north wind, and\nthe prairie, and the wolf; made them see him as he opened the door\nand stood there gazing wildly out, playing--always\nplaying--something weird and wonderful, and supernaturally terrible.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t envy Miguel his job none, by cripes,\u201d Big Medicine said, as\nthey drew near the point beyond which the cabin would stand revealed\nto them, and for a wonder he spoke softly.\n\nAndy glanced up at the yellow ball floating serenely over the blue\nocean of the sky, down the white-lighted coulee, with fringes of\nblack shadows here and there, and then at the cabin squatting\ndeserted against the green background of willows, with blank,\nstaring window and open doorway.\n\n\u201cIf such things can be--if the ghost of Olafson can come back, he\u2019ll\ncome to-night and try again to play the wind,\u201d he said solemnly.\n\u201cJust a low, even, creepy tone first on open G--\u201d\n\nThey rode slowly around to where they faced the door, pulled up\nshort fifty feet away from it, and stared.\n\n\u201cThere he is!\u201d Andy\u2019s voice was the whisper which carries far. \u201cHe\u2019s\ncome, boys--to play the wind again! A low, creepy note on open G--\u201d\n\nIn the doorway, where the moon shone radiantly in, stood a\nblack-clothed figure topped by a grinning, fleshless skull. Cuddled\nunder the horrid, bony chin of it was a violin. The right arm was\nupraised and bent, poising the bow above the strings. The staring,\nempty eye sockets were lighted with a pale, phosphorescent glow.\n\n\u201cWell, by golly!\u201d gulped Slim, in an undertone, and backed his horse\na little involuntarily.\n\n\u201cAw--\u201d Happy Jack looked at Irish and Cal, grinned sheepishly, and\nwas silent.\n\n\u201cGo on, Miggie, and git your olives,\u201d Big Medicine murmured. \u201cTwelve\nbottles. We\u2019ll wait for yuh here.\u201d\n\nMiguel slid off his horse without a word and started forward,\nhesitating a trifle, if the truth were known.\n\nIn the doorway the right arm of the figure trembled and moved slowly\nupward, pulling the bow lightly across the strings. Came a low,\nwailing note on open G, which swelled resonantly in the quiet air,\nrose a tone, clung there, and slid eerily down to silence.\n\nBig Medicine started and stared across at Irish, and Cal Emmett, and\nJack Bates, who met his look incredulously. Miguel stopped short and\nstood a moment in the blank silence which followed. The gaunt, black\nfigure bulked huge in the doorway, and the fleshless mouth grinned\nat him sardonically.\n\nMiguel took a step or two forward. Again that ghostly arm lifted and\nswept the bow across the strings. Again the eerie tones came\nvibrantly, sliding up the scale, clinging, and wailing, and falling\nagain to silence when Miguel stood still.\n\nBig Medicine turned his horse short around, so that he faced those\nthree--Cal, Jack Bates, and Irish.\n\n\u201cSay!--the--the thing\u2019s playin\u2019, by cripes!\u201d he muttered accusingly,\nand edged off fearfully.\n\n\u201cAw--say!\u201d Happy Jack moved farther away in sudden, unashamed\nterror. \u201cWhat makes it--play?\u201d\n\nMiguel stood longer that time, and the silence rasped the nerves of\nthose who waited farther off. When he moved forward again the\nplaying began. When he stopped, the ghostly arm was still.\n\nHappy Jack, with an unexpected, inarticulate squawk, kicked his\nhorse in the ribs and fled down the coulee. Slim went after him,\ngalloping with elbows flapping wildly. Those who waited longer saw\nMiguel walk slowly up to the very threshold, and face the ghost that\nplayed over and over that one, awful strain. They saw him stop as if\nto gather together his courage, put down his head as if he were\nbattling a blizzard, and edge past the unearthly figure.\n\nAs he disappeared within, brushing swiftly past the ghost, the\nstrings twanged ominously. Came an unearthly screech which was like\ndemons howling as howls the gray wolf before a storm. It raised the\nhair on the scalp with that prickling sensation which is so\nextremely unpleasant, and it sent Big Medicine, Cal, Jack Bates, and\nIrish clattering down the coulee in the wake of Slim and Happy Jack.\n\nAndy Green held his horse and Miguel\u2019s back from following, and\nwatched them out of sight before he rode closer to the awful thing\nwhich guarded the door.\n\n\u201cAll right, boys--yuh may as well stop the concert; the audience is\nhalfway home by this time,\u201d he called out, chuckling as he\ndismounted and went clanking up to the doorway. \u201cSay, by gracious,\nyuh done fine! That last screech was sure a pippin--it like to have\nstampeded me.\u201d\n\nPink disentangled his fingers from a fine bit of string and grunted.\n\u201cIt ought to be. We\u2019ve been practicing that howl, off and on, for\nfour hours. How was the fiddling, Andy?\u201d\n\n\u201cOuta sight. Say, yuh better take them strings off the bow, and make\ndarned sure you ain\u2019t having any tracks, or anything. Let \u2019em come\nback and find everything just the way they fixed the plant--and then\nlet \u2019em put in their spare time figuring the thing out, if they can.\nThey\u2019ll likely come moseying back up here, pretty soon--all but\nHappy and Slim--so you want to hurry. If you two can beat us home,\nthey\u2019ll never get wise in a thousand years of hard thinking.\u201d He\nlooked the ghost over critically, gave a snort, and painstakingly\nstraightened the bow. \u201cDarned grave robbers,\u201d he exclaimed, looking\nat the skull. \u201cWell, hike boys; I hear \u2019em coming. Got the olives\nall right, Miguel? Come and get on your horse. We\u2019ll meet \u2019em down\nthe trail a ways if we can. And say,\u201d he called over his shoulder,\nwhen he was beside his horse again, \u201cyou fellows do some going! If\nyou ain\u2019t in bed when we get there, the stuff\u2019s off.\u201d Even while he\nlooked back, Pink and Weary dodged out and vanished in the gloom of\nthe willows.\n\nThe Native Son, bearing in a gunny sack twelve bottles of stuffed\nolives, and on his swarthy face an unstudied grin of elation, was\njust making ready to mount when Irish and Big Medicine became\nrecognizable in the moonlight below.\n\n\u201cWe thought we\u2019d come back and see if you were alive, anyway,\u201d Irish\nannounced shamefacedly, with a glance toward the cabin and the\nspectral figure in the doorway. \u201cWhat did it do to yuh, Mig?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing, only caterwaul like the devil all the time I was getting\nthe olives. It\u2019s shut up since I came out of the cabin. Seems like\nit hates visitors.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr--did it--did the ghost make all that noise, honest?\u201d Big\nMedicine\u2019s voice had lost some of its blatant assurance. He was\nbewildered, and he showed it.\n\n\u201cYou heard him sawing on that fiddle, didn\u2019t you? The screeching\nseemed to come from--just all over the room.\u201d Miguel waved his free\nhand vaguely. \u201cJust all over at once. Kinda got my goat, for a\nminute or two.\u201d\n\nThe group rode slowly away, and when Miguel was through speaking\nthey went in silence. Halfway up the hill, Irish turned in the\nsaddle and stared down at the roof of the little cabin showing black\nunder the moon.\n\n\u201cWell--I\u2019ll--be--darned!\u201d he stated slowly and emphatically, and\nrode on with the others, who seemed to be thinking deeply.\n\nTheir meditations must have been to some purpose, for, after a hasty\nword or two snatched in private with his fellow conspirators, Irish\nset the pace.\n\nAt the stable he did not wait to unsaddle first of all. Instead he\nwent hurriedly inside, lighted a match, and held it up while he\nsurveyed the wall where the Happy Family were wont to hang their\nsaddles--when they hung them anywhere. Two familiar saddles dangled\nthere, each hanging upon its accustomed peg by its accustomed right\nstirrup, proclaiming silently and unanswerably the fact of their\nowners\u2019 presence upon the ranch. When the match flickered and went\nout, Irish discovered that Cal, Jack Bates, Big Medicine, and Happy\nJack were standing behind him, staring also.\n\n\u201cWell--I\u2019ll--be--darned!\u201d said Irish again softly, and dropped the\nstub with a gesture of keen disappointment.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t them, then,\u201d muttered Big Medicine at his shoulder. \u201cAnd\nthe--the thing--it played, by cripes!\u201d",
