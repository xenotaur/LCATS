    "body": "\n\nIN THE LIBRARY\n\n\nThe fire had burnt low in the library, for the night was wet and warm.\nIt was now little more than a grey shell, and looked desolate.  Trayton\nBurleigh, still hot, rose from his armchair, and turning out one of the\ngas-jets, took a cigar from a box on a side-table and resumed his seat\nagain.\n\nThe apartment, which was on the third floor at the back of the house, was\na combination of library, study, and smoke-room, and was the daily\ndespair of the old housekeeper who, with the assistance of one servant,\nmanaged the house.  It was a bachelor establishment, and had been left to\nTrayton Burleigh and James Fletcher by a distant connection of both men\nsome ten years before.\n\nTrayton Burleigh sat back in his chair watching the smoke of his cigar\nthrough half-closed eyes.  Occasionally he opened them a little wider and\nglanced round the comfortable, well-furnished room, or stared with a cold\ngleam of hatred at Fletcher as he sat sucking stolidly at his brier pipe.\nIt was a comfortable room and a valuable house, half of which belonged to\nTrayton Burleigh; and yet he was to leave it in the morning and become a\nrogue and a wanderer over the face of the earth.  James Fletcher had said\nso.  James Fletcher, with the pipe still between his teeth and speaking\nfrom one corner of his mouth only, had pronounced his sentence.\n\n\"It hasn't occurred to you, I suppose,\" said Burleigh, speaking suddenly,\n\"that I might refuse your terms.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Fletcher, simply.\n\nBurleigh took a great mouthful of smoke and let it roll slowly out.\n\n\"I am to go out and leave you in possession?\"  he continued.  \"You will\nstay here sole proprietor of the house; you will stay at the office sole\nowner and representative of the firm?  You are a good hand at a deal,\nJames Fletcher.\"\n\n\"I am an honest man,\" said Fletcher, \"and to raise sufficient money to\nmake your defalcations good will not by any means leave me the gainer, as\nyou very well know.\"\n\n\"There is no necessity to borrow,\" began Burleigh, eagerly.  \"We can pay\nthe interest easily, and in course of time make the principal good\nwithout a soul being the wiser.\"\n\n\"That you suggested before,\" said Fletcher, \"and my answer is the same.\nI will be no man's confederate in dishonesty; I will raise every penny at\nall costs, and save the name of the firm--and yours with it--but I will\nnever have you darken the office again, or sit in this house after\nto-night.\"\n\n\"You won't,\" cried Burleigh, starting up in a frenzy of rage.\n\n\"I won't,\" said Fletcher.  \"You can choose the alternative: disgrace and\npenal servitude.  Don't stand over me; you won't frighten me, I can\nassure you.  Sit down.\"\n\n\"You have arranged so many things in your kindness,\" said Burleigh,\nslowly, resuming his seat again, \"have you arranged how I am to live?\"\n\n\"You have two strong hands, and health,\" replied Fletcher.  \"I will give\nyou the two hundred pounds I mentioned, and after that you must look out\nfor yourself.  You can take it now.\"\n\nHe took a leather case from his breast pocket, and drew out a roll of\nnotes.  Burleigh, watching him calmly, stretched out his hand and took\nthem from the table.  Then he gave way to a sudden access of rage, and\ncrumpling them in his hand, threw them into a corner of the room.\nFletcher smoked on.\n\n\"Mrs. Marl is out?\" said Burleigh, suddenly.\n\nFletcher nodded.\n\n\"She will be away the night,\" he said, slowly; \"and Jane too; they have\ngone together somewhere, but they will be back at half-past eight in the\nmorning.\"\n\n\"You are going to let me have one more breakfast in the old place, then,\"\nsaid Burleigh.  \"Half-past eight, half-past----\"\n\nHe rose from his chair again.  This time Fletcher took his pipe from his\nmouth and watched him closely.  Burleigh stooped, and picking up the\nnotes, placed them in his pocket.\n\n\"If I am to be turned adrift, it shall not be to leave you here,\" he\nsaid, in a thick voice.\n\nHe crossed over and shut the door; as he turned back Fletcher rose from\nhis chair and stood confronting him.  Burleigh put his hand to the wall,\nand drawing a small Japanese sword from its sheath of carved ivory,\nstepped slowly toward him.\n\n\"I give you one chance, Fletcher,\" he said, grimly.  \"You are a man of\nyour word.  Hush this up and let things be as they were before, and you\nare safe.\"\n\n\"Put that down,\" said Fletcher, sharply.\n\n\"By ---, I mean what I say!\"  cried the other.\n\n\"I mean what I said!\"  answered Fletcher.\n\nHe looked round at the last moment for a weapon, then he turned suddenly\nat a sharp sudden pain, and saw Burleigh's clenched fist nearly touching\nhis breast-bone.  The hand came away from his breast again, and something\nwith it.  It went a long way off.  Trayton Burleigh suddenly went to a\ngreat distance and the room darkened.  It got quite dark, and Fletcher,\nwith an attempt to raise his hands, let them fall to his side instead,\nand fell in a heap to the floor.\n\nHe was so still that Burleigh could hardly realize that it was all over,\nand stood stupidly waiting for him to rise again.  Then he took out his\nhandkerchief as though to wipe the sword, and thinking better of it, put\nit back into his pocket again, and threw the weapon on to the floor.\n\nThe body of Fletcher lay where it had fallen, the white face turned up to\nthe gas.  In life he had been a commonplace-looking man, not to say\nvulgar; now Burleigh, with a feeling of nausea, drew back toward the\ndoor, until the body was hidden by the table, and relieved from the\nsight, he could think more clearly.  He looked down carefully and\nexamined his clothes and his boots.  Then he crossed the room again, and\nwith his face averted, turned out the gas.  Something seemed to stir in\nthe darkness, and with a faint cry he blundered toward the door before he\nhad realized that it was the clock.  It struck twelve.\n\nHe stood at the head of the stairs trying to recover himself; trying to\nthink.  The gas on the landing below, the stairs and the furniture, all\nlooked so prosaic and familiar that he could not realize what had\noccurred.  He walked slowly down and turned the light out.  The darkness\nof the upper part of the house was now almost appalling, and in a sudden\npanic he ran down stairs into the lighted hall, and snatching a hat from\nthe stand, went to the door and walked down to the gate.\n\nExcept for one window the neighbouring houses were in darkness, and the\nlamps shone tip a silent street.  There was a little rain in the air, and\nthe muddy road was full of pebbles.  He stood at the gate trying to screw\nup his courage to enter the house again.  Then he noticed a figure coming\nslowly up the road and keeping close to the palings.\n\nThe full realization of what he had done broke in upon him when he found\nhimself turning to fly from the approach of the constable.  The wet cape\nglistening in the lamplight, the slow, heavy step, made him tremble.\nSuppose the thing upstairs was not quite dead and should cry out?\nSuppose the constable should think it strange for him to be standing\nthere and follow him in?  He assumed a careless attitude, which did not\nfeel careless, and as the man passed bade him good-night, and made a\nremark as to the weather.\n\nEre the sound of the other's footsteps had gone quite out of hearing,\nhe turned and entered the house again before the sense of companionship\nshould have quite departed.  The first flight of stairs was lighted by\nthe gas in the hall, and he went up slowly.  Then he struck a match and\nwent up steadily, past the library door, and with firm fingers turned on\nthe gas in his bedroom and lit it.  He opened the window a little way,\nand sitting down on his bed, tried to think.\n\nHe had got eight hours.  Eight hours and two hundred pounds in small\nnotes.  He opened his safe and took out all the loose cash it contained,\nand walking about the room, gathered up and placed in his pockets such\narticles of jewellery as he possessed.\n\nThe first horror had now to some extent passed, and was succeeded by the\nfear of death.\n\nWith this fear on him he sat down again and tried to think out the first\nmoves in that game of skill of which his life was the stake.  He had\noften read of people of hasty temper, evading the police for a time, and\neventually falling into their hands for lack of the most elementary\ncommon sense.  He had heard it said that they always made some stupid\nblunder, left behind them some damning clue.  He took his revolver from a\ndrawer and saw that it was loaded.  If the worst came to the worst, he\nwould die quickly.\n\nEight hours' start; two hundred odd pounds.  He would take lodgings at\nfirst in some populous district, and let the hair on his face grow.  When\nthe hue-and-cry had ceased, he would go abroad and start life again.  He\nwould go out of a night and post letters to himself, or better still,\npostcards, which his landlady would read.  Postcards from cheery friends,\nfrom a sister, from a brother.  During the day he would stay in and\nwrite, as became a man who described himself as a journalist.\n\nOr suppose he went to the sea?  Who would look for him in flannels,\nbathing and boating with ordinary happy mortals?  He sat and pondered.\nOne might mean life, and the other death.  Which?\n\nHis face burned as he thought of the responsibility of the choice.  So\nmany people went to the sea at that time of year that he would surely\npass unnoticed.  But at the sea one might meet acquaintances.  He got up\nand nervously paced the room again.  It was not so simple, now that it\nmeant so much, as he had thought.\n\nThe sharp little clock on the mantel-piece rang out \"one,\" followed\nimmediately by the deeper note of that in the library.  He thought of the\nclock, it seemed the only live thing in that room, and shuddered.  He\nwondered whether the thing lying by the far side of the table heard it.\nHe wondered----\n\nHe started and held his breath with fear.  Somewhere down stairs a board\ncreaked loudly, then another.  He went to the door, and opening it a\nlittle way, but without looking out, listened.  The house was so still\nthat he could hear the ticking of the old clock in the kitchen below.  He\nopened the door a little wider and peeped out.  As he did so there was a\nsudden sharp outcry on the stairs, and he drew back into the room and\nstood trembling before he had quite realized that the noise had been made\nby the cat.  The cry was unmistakable; but what had disturbed it?\n\nThere was silence again, and he drew near the door once more.  He became\ncertain that something was moving stealthily on the stairs.  He heard the\nboards creak again, and once the rails of the balustrade rattled.  The\nsilence and suspense were frightful.  Suppose that the something which\nhad been Fletcher waited for him in the darkness outside?\n\nHe fought his fears down, and opening the door, determined to see what\nwas beyond.  The light from his room streamed out on to the landing, and\nhe peered about fearfully.  Was it fancy, or did the door of Fletcher's\nroom opposite close as he looked?  Was it fancy, or did the handle of the\ndoor really turn?\n\nIn perfect silence, and watching the door as he moved, to see that\nnothing came out and followed him, he proceeded slowly down the dark\nstairs.  Then his jaw fell, and he turned sick and faint again.  The\nlibrary door, which he distinctly remembered closing, and which,\nmoreover, he had seen was closed when he went up stairs to his room, now\nstood open some four or five inches.  He fancied that there was a\nrustling inside, but his brain refused to be certain.  Then plainly and\nunmistakably he heard a chair pushed against the wall.\n\nHe crept to the door, hoping to pass it before the thing inside became\naware of his presence.  Something crept stealthily about the room.  With\na sudden impulse he caught the handle of the door, and, closing it\nviolently, turned the key in the lock, and ran madly down the stairs.\n\nA fearful cry sounded from the room, and a heavy hand beat upon the\npanels of the door.  The house rang with the blows, but above them\nsounded the loud hoarse cries of human fear.  Burleigh, half-way down to\nthe hall, stopped with his hand on the balustrade and listened.  The\nbeating ceased, and a man's voice cried out loudly for God's sake to let\nhim out.\n\nAt once Burleigh saw what had happened and what it might mean for him.\nHe had left the hall door open after his visit to the front, and some\nwandering bird of the night had entered the house.  No need for him to go\nnow.  No need to hide either from the hangman's rope or the felon's cell.\nThe fool above had saved him.  He turned and ran up stairs again just as\nthe prisoner in his furious efforts to escape wrenched the handle from\nthe door.\n\n\"Who's there?\"  he cried, loudly.\n\n\"Let me out!\"  cried a frantic voice.  \"For God's sake, open the door!\nThere's something here.\"\n\n\"Stay where you are!\"  shouted Burleigh, sternly.  \"Stay where you are!\nIf you come out, I'll shoot you like a dog!\"\n\nThe only response was a smashing blow on the lock of the door.  Burleigh\nraised his pistol, and aiming at the height of a man's chest, fired\nthrough the panel.\n\nThe report and the crashing of the wood made one noise, succeeded by an\nunearthly stillness, then the noise of a window hastily opened.  Burleigh\nfled hastily down the stairs, and flinging wide the hall door, shouted\nloudly for assistance.\n\nIt happened that a sergeant and the constable on the beat had just met in\nthe road.  They came toward the house at a run.  Burleigh, with\nincoherent explanations, ran up stairs before them, and halted outside\nthe library door.  The prisoner was still inside, still trying to\ndemolish the lock of the sturdy oaken door.  Burleigh tried to turn the\nkey, but the lock was too damaged to admit of its moving.  The sergeant\ndrew back, and, shoulder foremost, hurled himself at the door and burst\nit open.\n\nHe stumbled into the room, followed by the constable, and two shafts of\nlight from the lanterns at their belts danced round the room.  A man\nlurking behind the door made a dash for it, and the next instant the\nthree men were locked together.\n\nBurleigh, standing in the doorway, looked on coldly, reserving himself\nfor the scene which was to follow.  Except for the stumbling of the men\nand the sharp catch of the prisoner's breath, there was no noise.  A\nhelmet fell off and bounced and rolled along the floor.  The men fell;\nthere was a sobbing snarl and a sharp click.  A tall figure rose from the\nfloor; the other, on his knees, still held the man down.  The standing\nfigure felt in his pocket, and, striking a match, lit the gas.\n\nThe light fell on the flushed face and fair beard of the sergeant.  He\nwas bare-headed, and his hair dishevelled.  Burleigh entered the room and\ngazed eagerly at the half-insensible man on the floor-a short, thick-set\nfellow with a white, dirty face and a black moustache.  His lip was cut\nand bled down his neck.  Burleigh glanced furtively at the table.  The\ncloth had come off in the struggle, and was now in the place where he had\nleft Fletcher.\n\n\"Hot work, sir,\" said the sergeant, with a smile.  \"It's fortunate we\nwere handy.\"\n\nThe prisoner raised a heavy head and looked up with unmistakable terror\nin his eyes.\n\n\"All right, sir,\" he said, trembling, as the constable increased the\npressure of his knee.  \"I 'ain't been in the house ten minutes\naltogether.  By ---, I've not.\"\n\nThe sergeant regarded him curiously.\n\n\"It don't signify,\" he said, slowly; \"ten minutes or ten seconds won't\nmake any difference.\"\n\nThe man shook and began to whimper.\n\n\"It was 'ere when I come,\" he said, eagerly; \"take that down, sir.  I've\nonly just come, and it was 'ere when I come.  I tried to get away then,\nbut I was locked in.\"\n\n\"What was?\"  demanded the sergeant.\n\n\"That,\" he said, desperately.\n\nThe sergeant, following the direction of the terror-stricken black eyes,\nstooped by the table.  Then, with a sharp exclamation, he dragged away\nthe cloth.  Burleigh, with a sharp cry of horror, reeled back against the\nwall.\n\n\"All right, sir,\" said the sergeant, catching him; \"all right.  Turn your\nhead away.\"\n\nHe pushed him into a chair, and crossing the room, poured out a glass of\nwhiskey and brought it to him.  The glass rattled against his teeth, but\nhe drank it greedily, and then groaned faintly.  The sergeant waited\npatiently.  There was no hurry.\n\n\"Who is it, sir?\"  he asked at length.\n\n\"My friend--Fletcher,\" said Burleigh, with an effort.  \"We lived\ntogether.\"  He turned to the prisoner.\n\n\"You damned villain!\"\n\n\"He was dead when I come in the room, gentlemen,\" said the prisoner,\nstrenuously.  \"He was on the floor dead, and when I see 'im, I tried to\nget out.  S' 'elp me he was.  You heard me call out, sir.  I shouldn't\nha' called out if I'd killed him.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said the sergeant, gruffly; \"you'd better hold your tongue,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"You keep quiet,\" urged the constable.\n\nThe sergeant knelt down and raised the dead man's head.\n\n\"I 'ad nothing to do with it,\" repeated the man on the floor.  \"I 'ad\nnothing to do with it.  I never thought of such a thing.  I've only been\nin the place ten minutes; put that down, sir.\"\n\nThe sergeant groped with his left hand, and picking up the Japanese\nsword, held it at him.\n\n\"I've never seen it before,\" said the prisoner, struggling.\n\n\"It used to hang on the wall,\" said Burleigh.  \"He must have snatched it\ndown.  It was on the wall when I left Fletcher a little while ago.\"\n\n\"How long?\"  inquired the sergeant.\n\n\"Perhaps an hour, perhaps half an hour,\" was the reply.  \"I went to my\nbedroom.\"\n\nThe man on the floor twisted his head and regarded him narrowly.\n\n\"You done it!\"  he cried, fiercely.  \"You done it, and you want me to\nswing for it.\"\n\n\"That 'll do,\" said the indignant constable.\n\nThe sergeant let his burden gently to the floor again.\n\n\"You hold your tongue, you devil!\"  he said, menacingly.\n\nHe crossed to the table and poured a little spirit into a glass and took\nit in his hand.  Then he put it down again and crossed to Burleigh.\n\n\"Feeling better, sir?\"  he asked.\n\nThe other nodded faintly.\n\n\"You won't want this thing any more,\" said the sergeant.\n\nHe pointed to the pistol which the other still held, and taking it from\nhim gently, put it into his pocket.\n\n\"You've hurt your wrist, sir,\" he said, anxiously.\n\nBurleigh raised one hand sharply, and then the other.\n\n\"This one, I think,\" said the sergeant.  \"I saw it just now.\"\n\nHe took the other's wrists in his hand, and suddenly holding them in the\ngrip of a vice, whipped out something from his pocket--something hard and\ncold, which snapped suddenly on Burleigh's wrists, and held them fast.\n\n\"That's right,\" said the sergeant; \"keep quiet.\"\n\nThe constable turned round in amaze; Burleigh sprang toward him\nfuriously.\n\n\"Take these things off!\"  he choked.  \"Have you gone mad?  Take them\noff!\"\n\n\"All in good time,\" said the sergeant.\n\n\"Take them off!\"  cried Burleigh again.\n\nFor answer the sergeant took him in a powerful grip, and staring steadily\nat his white face and gleaming eyes, forced him to the other end of the\nroom and pushed him into a chair.\n\n\"Collins,\" he said, sharply.\n\n\"Sir?\"  said the astonished subordinate.\n\n\"Run to the doctor at the corner hard as you can run!\"  said the other.\n\"This man is not dead!\"\n\nAs the man left the room the sergeant took up the glass of spirits he had\npoured out, and kneeling down by Fletcher again, raised his head and\ntried to pour a little down his throat.  Burleigh, sitting in his corner,\nwatched like one in a trance.  He saw the constable return with the\nbreathless surgeon, saw the three men bending over Fletcher, and then saw\nthe eyes of the dying man open and the lips of the dying man move.  He\nwas conscious that the sergeant made some notes in a pocket-book, and\nthat all three men eyed him closely.  The sergeant stepped toward him and\nplaced his hand on his shoulder, and obedient to the touch, he arose and\nwent with him out into the night.",
