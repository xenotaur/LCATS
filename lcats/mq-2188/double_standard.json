    "body": "It was after oh-one-hundred when Kane arrived at my apartment.\nI checked the hall screen carefully before letting him in, too,\nthough the hour almost precluded the possibility of any inquisitive\npassers-by.\n\nHe didn't say anything at all when he saw me, but his eyes went\na bit wide. That was perfectly natural, after all. The illegal\nplasti-cosmetician had done his work better than well. I wasn't the\nsame person I had been.\n\nI led Kane into the living room and stood before him, letting him have\na good look at me.\n\n\"Well,\" I asked, \"will it work?\"\n\nKane lit a cigarette thoughtfully, not taking his eyes off me.\n\n\"Maybe,\" he said. \"Just maybe.\"\n\nI thought about the spaceship standing proud and tall under the stars,\nready to go. And I knew that it had to work. It _had_ to.\n\nSome men dream of money, others of power. All my life I had dreamed\nonly of lands in the sky. The red sand hills of Mars, moldering in\naged slumber under a cobalt-colored day; the icy moraines of Io and\nCallisto, where the yellow methane snow drifted in the faint light\nof the Sun; the barren, stark seas of the Moon, where razor-backed\nmountains limned themselves against the star fields--\n\n\"I don't know, Kim; you're asking a hell of a lot, you know,\" Kane said.\n\n\"It'll work,\" I assured him. \"The examination is cursory after the\napplication has been acted on.\" I grinned easily under the flesh mask.\n\"And mine has.\"\n\n\"You mean Kim Hall's application has,\" he said.\n\nI shrugged. \"Well?\"\n\nKane frowned at me and blew smoke into the still air of the room. \"The\nKim Hall on the application and you aren't exactly the same person. I\ndon't have to tell you that.\"\n\n\"Look,\" I said. \"I called you here tonight to check me over and because\nwe've been friends for a good long time. This is important to me, Kane.\nIt isn't just that I _want_ to go. I _have_ to. You can understand\nthat, maybe.\"\n\n\"Yes, Kim,\" he said bitterly. \"I can understand. Maybe if I had your\nbuild and mass, I'd be trying the same thing right now. My only\nchance was the Eugenics Board and they turned me down cold. Remember?\nSex-linked predilection to carcinoma. Unsuitable for colonial breeding\nstock--\"\n\nI felt a wave of pity for Kane then. I was almost sorry I'd called him\nover. Within six hours I would be on board the spaceship, while he\nwould be here. Earthbound for always. Unsuitable for breeding stock in\nthe controlled colonies of Mars or Io and Callisto.\n\nI thought about that, too. I knew I wouldn't be able to carry off\nmy masquerade forever. I wouldn't want to. The stringent physical\nexamination given on landing would pierce my disguise easily. But\nby that time it would be too late. I'd _be_ there, out among the\nstars. And no Earthbound spaceship captain would carry my mass back\ninstead of precious cargo. I'd stay. If they wanted me for a breeder\nthen--okay. In spite of my slight build and lack of physical strength,\nI'd still be where I wanted to be. In the fey lands in the sky....\n\n\"I wish you all the luck in the world, Kim,\" my friend said. \"I really\ndo. I don't mean to throw cold water on your scheme. You know how few\nof _us_ are permitted off-world. Every one who makes it is a--\" he\ngrinned ruefully--\"a blow struck for equality.\" He savored the irony\nof it for a moment and then his face grew serious again. \"It's just\nthat the more I think of what you've done, the more convinced I am that\nyou can't get away with it. Forged applications. Fake fingerprints\nand X-rays. And _this_--\" He made a gesture that took in all of my\nappearance. Flesh, hair, clothes. Everything.\n\n\"What the hell,\" I said. \"It's good, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Very good. In fact, you make me uncomfortable, it's so good. But it's\ntoo damned insane.\"\n\n\"Insane enough to work,\" I said. \"And it's the only chance. How do you\nthink I'd stack up with the Eugenics Board? Not a chance. What they\nwant out there is big muscle boys. Tough breeders. This is the only way\nfor me.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Kane said. \"You're big enough now, it seems to me.\"\n\n\"Had to be. Lots to cover up. Lots to add.\"\n\n\"And you're all set? Packed and ready?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"All set.\"\n\n\"Then I guess this is it.\" He extended his hand. I took it. \"Good\nluck, Kim. Always,\" he said huskily. \"I'll hear if you make it. All of\nus will. And we'll be cheering and thinking that maybe, before we're\nall too old, we can make it, too. And if not, that maybe our sons\nwill--without having to be prize bulls, either.\"\n\nHe turned in the doorway and forced a grin.\n\n\"Don't forget to write,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe spacefield was streaked with the glare of floodlights, and the ship\ngleamed like a silvery spire against the desert night.\n\nI joined the line of passengers at the checking desk, my half-kilo of\nbaggage clutched nervously against my side. My heart was pounding with\na mixture of fear and anticipation, my muscles twitching under the\nunaccustomed tension of the plastiflesh sheath that hid me.\n\nAll around me were the smells and sounds and sights of a spaceport, and\nabove me were the stars, brilliant and close at hand in the dark sky.\n\nThe queue moved swiftly toward the checking desk, where a gray-haired\nofficer with a seamed face sat.\n\nThe voice of the timekeeper came periodically from the loudspeakers\naround the perimeter of the field.\n\n\"_Passengers for the Martian Queen, check in at desk five. It is now H\nminus forty-seven._\"\n\nI stood now before the officer, tense and afraid. This was critical,\nthe last check-point before I could actually set foot in the ship.\n\n\"_It is now H minus forty-five_,\" the timer's metallic voice said.\n\nThe officer looked up at me, and then at the faked photoprint on my\npapers.\n\n\"Kim Hall, age twenty-nine, vocation agri-technician and hydroponics\nexpert, height 171 centimeters, weight 60 kilos. Right?\"\n\nI nodded soundlessly.\n\n\"Sums check within mass-limits. Physical condition index 3.69.\nFertility index 3.66. Compatibility index 2.99.\" The officer turned to\na trim-looking assistant. \"All check?\"\n\nThe uniformed girl nodded.\n\nI began to breathe again.\n\n\"Next desk, please,\" the officer said shortly.\n\nI moved on to the medics at the next stop. A gray-clad nurse checked my\npulse and respiration. She smiled at me.\n\n\"Excited?\" she asked. \"Don't be.\" She indicated the section of the\nchecking station where the breeders were being processed. \"You should\nsee how the bulls take it,\" she said with a laugh.\n\nShe picked up an electrified stamp. \"Now don't worry. This won't hurt\nand it won't disfigure you permanently. But the ship's guards won't let\nyou aboard without it. Government regulations, you know. We cannot load\npersonal dossiers on the ships and this will tell the officers all they\nneed to know about you. Weight limitations, you see.\"\n\nI almost laughed in her face at that. If there was one thing all Earth\ncould offer me that I wanted, it was that stamp on my forehead: a\npassport to the stars....\n\nShe set the stamp and pressed it against my forehead. I had a momentary\nfear about the durability of the flesh mask that covered my face, but\nit was unnecessary. The plastiskin took the temporary tattoo the way\nreal flesh would have.\n\nI felt the skin and read it in my mind. I knew exactly what it said.\nI'd dreamed of it so often and so long all my life. My ticket on the\n_Martian Queen_. My pass to those lands in the sky.\n\n     CERT SXF HALL, K. RS MART QUEEN SN1775690.\n\nI walked across the ramp and into the lift beside the great tapering\nhull of the rocket. My heart was singing.\n\nThe timer said: \"_It is H minus thirty-one_.\"\n\nAnd then I stepped through the outer valve, into the _Queen_. The\nair was brisk with the tang of hydrogenol. Space-fuel. The ship was\nalive and humming with a thousand relays and timers and whispering\ngenerators, readying herself for space.\n\n\n\nI lay down in the acceleration hammock and listened to the ship.\n\nThis was everything I had wished for all my life. To be a free man\namong the stars. It was worth the chances I had taken, worth the lying\nand cheating and danger.\n\nThe conquest of space had split humanity in a manner that no one could\nhave foreseen, though the reasons for the schism were obvious. They\nhinged on two factors--mass and durability. Thus it was that some\nremained forever Earthbound while others reached for the sky. And\nbureaucracy being what it was, the decision as to who stayed and who\nwent was made along the easy, obvious line of demarcation.\n\nI and half the human race were on the wrong side of the line.\n\nFrom the ship's speakers came the voice of the timer.\n\n\"_It is H minus ten. Ready yourselves for the takeoff._\"\n\nI thought of Kane and the men I had known and worked with for half of\nmy twenty-nine years. They, too, were forbidden the sky. Tragic men,\nreally, with their need and their dream written in the lines of pain\nand yearning on their faces.\n\nThe speaker suddenly snapped:\n\n\"_There is an illegal passenger on board! All persons will remain in\ntheir quarters until he is apprehended! Repeat: there is an illegal\npassenger on board! Remain in your quarters!_\"\n\nMy heart seemed to stop beating. Somehow, my deception had been\nuncovered. How, it didn't matter, but it had. And the important thing\nnow was simply to stay on board at all costs. A space ship departure\ncould not be delayed. The orbit was computed. The blastaway timed to\nthe millisecond....\n\nI leaped to the deck and out of my cubicle. A spidery catwalk led\nupward, toward the nose of the ship. Below me I could hear the first\nsounds of the search.\n\nI ran up the walk, my footsteps sounding hollowly in the steel shaft. A\nbulkhead blocked my progress ahead and I sought the next deck.\n\nThe timer said: \"_It is H minus six_.\"\n\nIt was a passenger deck. I could see frightened faces peering out of\ncubicles as I ran past. Behind me, the pursuit grew louder, nearer.\n\nI slammed open a bulkhead and found another walk leading upward toward\nthe astrogation blisters in the topmost point of the _Queen_.\n\nBehind me, I caught a glimpse of a ship's officer running, armed with a\nstun-pistol. My breath rasped in my throat and the plastiskin sheath on\nmy body shifted sickeningly.\n\n\"_You there! Halt!_\" The voice was high-pitched and excited. I flung\nthrough another bulkhead hatch and out into the dorsal blister. I\nseemed to be suspended between Earth and sky. The stars glittered\nthrough the steelglass of the blister, and the desert lay below,\nstreaked with searchlights and covered with tiny milling figures. The\nwarning light on the control bunker turned from amber to red as I\nwatched, chest heaving.\n\n\"_It is H minus three_,\" the timer said. \"_Rig ship for space._\"\n\nI slammed the hatch shut and spun the wheel lock. I stood filled with\na mixture of triumph and fear. They could never get me out of the\nship in time now--but I would have to face blast away in the blister,\nunprotected. A shock that could kill....\n\nThrough the speaker, the captain's talker snapped orders: \"_Abandon\npursuit! Too late to dump him now. Pick him up after acceleration is\ncompleted._\" And then maliciously, knowing that I could hear: \"_Scrape\nhim off the deck when we're in space._ That _kind can't take much_.\"\n\nI felt a blaze of red fury. _That_ kind. The Earthbound kind! I wanted\nto live, then, more than I had ever wanted to live before. To make a\nliar out of that sneering, superior voice. To prove that I was as good\nas all of them.\n\n\"_It is H minus one_,\" said the timer.\n\nOrders filtered through the speaker.\n\n\"_Outer valves closed. Inner valves closed._\"\n\n\"_Minus thirty seconds. Condition red._\"\n\n\"_Pressure in the ship. One-third atmosphere._\"\n\n\"_Twenty seconds._\"\n\n\"_Ship secure for space._\"\n\n\"_Ten, nine, eight_--\"\n\nI lay prone on the steel deck, braced myself and prayed.\n\n\"_Seven, six, five_--\"\n\n\"_Gyros on. Course set._\"\n\n\"_Four, three, two_--\"\n\nThe ship trembled. A great light flared beyond the curving transparency\nof the blister.\n\n\"_Up ship!_\"\n\nA hand smashed down on me, crushing me into the deck.\n\nI thought: _I must live. I can't die. I won't die!_\n\nI felt the spaceship rising. I felt her reaching for the stars. I was\na part of her. I screamed with pain and exaltation. The hand pressed\nharder, choking the breath from me, stripping the plastiskin away in\nlong, damp strips.\n\nDarkness flickered before my eyes. I lay helpless and afraid and\ntransfigured with a joy I had never known before.\n\nDistorted, half-naked, I clung to life.\n\n\n\nWhen I opened my eyes, they were all around me. They stood in a\nhalf-circle, trim, uniformed. Their smooth faces and cropped hair\nand softly molded bodies looked strange against the functional steel\nangularity of the astrogation blister.\n\nI staggered to my feet, long strips of plastic flesh dangling from me.\n\nThe _Queen_ was in space. I was in space, no longer Earthbound.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"I lived! Look at me!\"\n\nI stripped off the flesh mask, peeled away the red, full lips, the long\ntransformation.\n\n\"I've done it. Others will do it, too. Not breeders--not brainless\nornaments to a hyper-nymphoid phallus! Just ordinary men. Ordinary men\nwith a dream. You can't keep the sky for yourselves. It belongs to all\nof us.\"\n\nI stood with my back to the blazing stars and laughed at them.\n\n\"In the beginning it was right that you should be given priority\nover us. For centuries we kept you in subjection and when the Age of\nSpace came, you found your place. Your stamina, your small stature,\neverything about you fitted you to be mistresses of the sky....\n\n\"But it's over. Over and done with. We can all be free--\"\n\nI peeled away the artificial breasts that dangled from my chest.\n\nI stood swaying drunkenly, defiantly.\n\nThey came to me, then. They took me gently and carried me below, to the\ncomfort of a white bunk. They soothed my hurts and nursed me. For in\nspite of it all, they were women and I was a man in pain.",
