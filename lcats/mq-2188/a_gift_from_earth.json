    "body": "\"It is an outrage,\" said Koltan of the House of Masur, \"that the\nEarthmen land among the Thorabians!\"\n\nZotul, youngest of the Masur brothers, stirred uneasily. Personally, he\nwas in favor of the coming of the Earthmen to the world of Zur.\n\nAt the head of the long, shining table sat old Kalrab Masur, in his\ndotage, but still giving what he could of aid and comfort to the\nPottery of Masur, even though nobody listened to him any more and\nhe knew it. Around the table sat the six brothers--Koltan, eldest\nand Director of the Pottery; Morvan, his vice-chief; Singula, their\ntreasurer; Thendro, sales manager; Lubiosa, export chief; and last in\nthe rank of age, Zotul, who was responsible for affairs of design.\n\n\"Behold, my sons,\" said Kalrab, stroking his scanty beard. \"What are\nthese Earthmen to worry about? Remember the clay. It is our strength\nand our fortune. It is the muscle and bone of our trade. Earthmen may\ncome and Earthmen may go, but clay goes on forever ... and with it, the\nfame and fortune of the House of Masur.\"\n\n\"It _is_ a damned imposition,\" agreed Morvan, ignoring his father's\nphilosophical attitude. \"They could have landed just as easily here in\nLor.\"\n\n\"The Thorabians will lick up the gravy,\" said Singula, whose mind ran\nrather to matters of financial aspect, \"and leave us the grease.\"\n\nBy this, he seemed to imply that the Thorabians would rob the Earthmen,\nwhich the Lorians would not. The truth was that all on Zur were panting\nto get their hands on that marvelous ship, which was all of metal, a\nvery scarce commodity on Zur, worth billions of ken.\n\n\n\nLubiosa, who had interests in Thorabia, and many agents there, kept his\nown counsel. His people were active in the matter and that was enough\nfor him. He would report when the time was ripe.\n\n\"Doubtless,\" said Zotul unexpectedly, for the youngest at a conference\nwas expected to keep his mouth shut and applaud the decisions of his\nelders, \"the Earthmen used all the metal on their planet in building\nthat ship. We cannot possibly bilk them of it; it is their only means\nof transport.\"\n\nSuch frank expression of motive was unheard of, even in the secret\nconclave of conference. Only the speaker's youth could account for it.\nThe speech drew scowls from the brothers and stern rebuke from Koltan.\n\n\"When your opinion is wanted, we will ask you for it. Meantime,\nremember your position in the family.\"\n\nZotul bowed his head meekly, but he burned with resentment.\n\n\"Listen to the boy,\" said the aged father. \"There is more wisdom in his\nhead than in all the rest of you. Forget the Earthmen and think only of\nthe clay.\"\n\nZotul did not appreciate his father's approval, for it only earned him\na beating as soon as the old man went to bed. It was a common enough\nthing among the brothers Masur, as among everybody, to be frustrated in\ntheir desires. However, they had Zotul to take it out upon, and they\ndid.\n\nStill smarting, Zotul went back to his designing quarters and thought\nabout the Earthmen. If it was impossible to hope for much in the way\nof metal from the Earthmen, what could one get from them? If he could\nfigure this problem out, he might rise somewhat in the estimation of\nhis brothers. That wouldn't take him out of the rank of scapegoat, of\ncourse, but the beatings might become fewer and less severe.\n\n\n\nBy and by, the Earthmen came to Lor, flying through the air in strange\nmetal contraptions. They paraded through the tile-paved streets of the\ncity, marveled here, as they had in Thorabia, at the buildings all of\ntile inside and out, and made a great show of themselves for all the\npeople to see. Speeches were made through interpreters, who had much\ntoo quickly learned the tongue of the aliens; hence these left much to\nbe desired in the way of clarity, though their sincerity was evident.\n\nThe Earthmen were going to do great things for the whole world of\nZur. It required but the cooperation--an excellent word, that--of all\nZurians, and many blessings would rain down from the skies. This, in\neffect, was what the Earthmen had to say. Zotul felt greatly cheered,\nfor it refuted the attitude of his brothers without earning him a\nwhaling for it.\n\nThere was also some talk going around about agreements made between\nthe Earthmen and officials of the Lorian government, but you heard one\nthing one day and another the next. Accurate reporting, much less a\nnewspaper, was unknown on Zur.\n\nFinally, the Earthmen took off in their great, shining ship. Obviously,\nnone had succeeded in chiseling them out of it, if, indeed, any had\ntried. The anti-Earthmen Faction--in any culture complex, there is\nalways an \"anti\" faction to protest any movement of endeavor--crowed\nhappily that the Earthmen were gone for good, and a good thing, too.\n\nSuch jubilation proved premature, however. One day, a fleet of ships\narrived and after they had landed all over the planet, Zur was\npractically acrawl with Earthmen.\n\nImmediately, the Earthmen established what they called\n\"corporations\"--Zurian trading companies under terrestrial control. The\nobject of the visit was trade.\n\nIn spite of the fact that a terrestrial ship had landed at every Zurian\ncity of major and minor importance, and all in a single day, it took\nsome time for the news to spread.\n\nThe first awareness Zotul had was that, upon coming home from the\npottery one evening, he found his wife Lania proudly brandishing an\naluminum pot at him.\n\n\"What is that thing?\" he asked curiously.\n\n\"A pot. I bought it at the market.\"\n\n\"Did you now? Well, take it back. Am I made of money that you spend my\nsubstance for some fool's product of precious metal? Take it back, I\nsay!\"\n\n\n\nThe pretty young wife laughed at him. \"Up to your ears in clay, no\nwonder you hear nothing of news! The pot is very cheap. The Earthmen\nare selling them everywhere. They're much better than our old clay\npots; they're light and easy to handle and they don't break when\ndropped.\"\n\n\"What good is it?\" asked Zotul, interested. \"How will it hold heat,\nbeing so light?\"\n\n\"The Earthmen don't cook as we do,\" she explained patiently. \"There is\na paper with each pot that explains how it is used. And you will have\nto design a new ceramic stove for me to use the pots on.\"\n\n\"Don't be idiotic! Do you suppose Koltan would agree to produce a new\ntype of stove when the old has sold well for centuries? Besides, why do\nyou need a whole new stove for one little pot?\"\n\n\"A dozen pots. They come in sets and are cheaper that way. And Koltan\nwill have to produce the new stove because all the housewives are\nbuying these pots and there will be a big demand for it. The Earthman\nsaid so.\"\n\n\"He did, did he? These pots are only a fad. You will soon enough go\nback to cooking with your old ones.\"\n\n\"The Earthman took them in trade--one reason why the new ones are so\ncheap. There isn't a pot in the house but these metal ones, and you\nwill have to design and produce a new stove if you expect me to use\nthem.\"\n\nAfter he had beaten his wife thoroughly for her foolishness, Zotul\nstamped off in a rage and designed a new ceramic stove, one that would\naccommodate the terrestrial pots very well.\n\nAnd Koltan put the model into production.\n\n\"Orders already are pouring in like mad,\" he said the next day. \"It\nwas wise of you to foresee it and have the design ready. Already, I am\nsorry for thinking as I did about the Earthmen. They really intend to\ndo well by us.\"\n\nThe kilns of the Pottery of Masur fired day and night to keep up with\nthe demand for the new porcelain stoves. In three years, more than a\nmillion had been made and sold by the Masurs alone, not counting the\nhundreds of thousands of copies turned out by competitors in every\nland.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, however, more things than pots came from Earth.\nOne was a printing press, the like of which none on Zur had ever\ndreamed. This, for some unknown reason and much to the disgust of\nthe Lorians, was set up in Thorabia. Books and magazines poured from\nit in a fantastic stream. The populace fervidly brushed up on its\nscanty reading ability and bought everything available, overcome by\nthe novelty of it. Even Zotul bought a book--a primer in the Lorian\nlanguage--and learned how to read and write. The remainder of the\nbrothers Masur, on the other hand, preferred to remain in ignorance.\n\nMoreover, the Earthmen brought miles of copper wire--more than enough\nin value to buy out the governorship of any country on Zur--and set up\ntelegraph lines from country to country and continent to continent.\nWithin five years of the first landing of the Earthmen, every major\ncity on the globe had a printing press, a daily newspaper, and enjoyed\nthe instantaneous transmission of news via telegraph. And the business\nof the House of Masur continued to look up.\n\n\"As I have always said from the beginning,\" chortled Director Koltan,\n\"this coming of the Earthmen had been a great thing for us, and\nespecially for the House of Masur.\"\n\n\"You didn't think so at first,\" Zotul pointed out, and was immediately\nsorry, for Koltan turned and gave him a hiding, single-handed, for his\nunthinkable impertinence.\n\nIt would do no good, Zotul realized, to bring up the fact that their\nproduction of ceramic cooking pots had dropped off to about two per\ncent of its former volume. Of course, profits on the line of new stoves\ngreatly overbalanced the loss, so that actually they were ahead; but\ntheir business was now dependent upon the supply of the metal pots from\nEarth.\n\nAbout this time, plastic utensils--dishes, cups, knives, forks--made\ntheir appearance on Zur. It became very stylish to eat with the\nnewfangled paraphernalia ... and very cheap, too, because for\neverything they sold, the Earthmen always took the old ware in trade.\nWhat they did with the stuff had been hard to believe at first. They\ndestroyed it, which proved how valueless it really was.\n\nThe result of the new flood was that in the following year, the sale of\nMasur ceramic table service dropped to less than a tenth.\n\n\n\nTrembling with excitement at this news from their book-keeper, Koltan\ncalled an emergency meeting. He even routed old Kalrab out of his\nsenile stupor for the occasion, on the off chance that the old man\nmight still have a little wit left that could be helpful.\n\n\"Note,\" Koltan announced in a shaky voice, \"that the Earthmen undermine\nour business,\" and he read off the figures.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Zotul, \"it is a good thing also, as you said before,\nand will result in something even better for us.\"\n\nKoltan frowned, and Zotul, in fear of another beating, instantly\nsubsided.\n\n\"They are replacing our high-quality ceramic ware with inferior\nterrestrial junk,\" Koltan went on bitterly. \"It is only the glamor that\nsells it, of course, but before the people get the shine out of their\neyes, we can be ruined.\"\n\nThe brothers discussed the situation for an hour, and all the while\nFather Kalrab sat and pulled his scanty whiskers. Seeing that they got\nnowhere with their wrangle, he cleared his throat and spoke up.\n\n\"My sons, you forget it is not the Earthmen themselves at the bottom\nof your trouble, but the _things_ of Earth. Think of the telegraph and\nthe newspaper, how these spread news of every shipment from Earth.\nThe merchandise of the Earthmen is put up for sale by means of these\nnewspapers, which also are the property of the Earthmen. The people are\nintrigued by these advertisements, as they are called, and flock to\nbuy. Now, if you would pull a tooth from the kwi that bites you, you\nmight also have advertisements of your own.\"\n\nAlas for that suggestion, no newspaper would accept advertising\nfrom the House of Masur; all available space was occupied by the\nadvertisements of the Earthmen.\n\nIn their dozenth conference since that first and fateful one, the\nbrothers Masur decided upon drastic steps. In the meantime, several\nthings had happened. For one, old Kalrab had passed on to his immortal\nrest, but this made no real difference. For another, the Earthmen had\nprocured legal authority to prospect the planet for metals, of which\nthey found a good deal, but they told no one on Zur of this. What\nthey did mention was the crude oil and natural gas they discovered\nin the underlayers of the planet's crust. Crews of Zurians, working\nunder supervision of the Earthmen, laid pipelines from the gas and oil\nregions to every major and minor city on Zur.\n\n\n\nBy the time ten years had passed since the landing of the first\nterrestrial ship, the Earthmen were conducting a brisk business in\ngas-fired ranges, furnaces and heaters ... and the Masur stove business\nwas gone. Moreover, the Earthmen sold the Zurians their own natural gas\nat a nice profit and everybody was happy with the situation except the\nbrothers Masur.\n\nThe drastic steps of the brothers applied, therefore, to making an\nenergetic protest to the governor of Lor.\n\nAt one edge of the city, an area had been turned over to the Earthmen\nfor a spaceport, and the great terrestrial spaceships came to it and\ndeparted from it at regular intervals. As the heirs of the House of\nMasur walked by on their way to see the governor, Zotul observed that\nmuch new building was taking place and wondered what it was.\n\n\"Some new devilment of the Earthmen, you can be sure,\" said Koltan\nblackly.\n\nIn fact, the Earthmen were building an assembly plant for radio\nreceiving sets. The ship now standing on its fins upon the apron was\nloaded with printed circuits, resistors, variable condensers and other\nradio parts. This was Earth's first step toward flooding Zur with the\nnatural follow-up in its campaign of advertising--radio programs--with\ncommercials.\n\nHappily for the brothers, they did not understand this at the time or\nthey would surely have gone back to be buried in their own clay.\n\n\"I think,\" the governor told them, \"that you gentlemen have not\npaused to consider the affair from all angles. You must learn to be\nmodern--keep up with the times! We heads of government on Zur are doing\nall in our power to aid the Earthmen and facilitate their bringing a\ngreat, new culture that can only benefit us. See how Zur has changed in\nten short years! Imagine the world of tomorrow! Why, do you know they\nare even bringing _autos_ to Zur!\"\n\nThe brothers were fascinated with the governor's description of these\nhitherto unheard-of vehicles.\n\n\"It only remains,\" concluded the governor, \"to build highways, and the\nEarthmen are taking care of that.\"\n\nAt any rate, the brothers Masur were still able to console themselves\nthat they had their tile business. Tile served well enough for houses\nand street surfacing; what better material could be devised for the new\nhighways the governor spoke of? There was a lot of money to be made\nyet.\n\n\n\nRadio stations went up all over Zur and began broadcasting. The people\nbought receiving sets like mad. The automobiles arrived and highways\nwere constructed.\n\nThe last hope of the brothers was dashed. The Earthmen set up plants\nand began to manufacture Portland cement.\n\nYou could build a house of concrete much cheaper than with tile. Of\ncourse, since wood was scarce on Zur, it was no competition for either\ntile or concrete. Concrete floors were smoother, too, and the stuff\nmade far better road surfacing.\n\nThe demand for Masur tile hit rock bottom.\n\nThe next time the brothers went to see the governor, he said, \"I cannot\nhandle such complaints as yours. I must refer you to the Merchandising\nCouncil.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" asked Koltan.\n\n\"It is an Earthman association that deals with complaints such as\nyours. In the matter of material progress, we must expect some strain\nin the fabric of our culture. Machinery has been set up to deal with\nit. Here is their address; go air your troubles to them.\"\n\nThe business of a formal complaint was turned over by the brothers to\nZotul. It took three weeks for the Earthmen to get around to calling\nhim in, as a representative of the Pottery of Masur, for an interview.\n\nAll the brothers could no longer be spared from the plant, even for the\npurpose of pressing a complaint. Their days of idle wealth over, they\nhad to get in and work with the clay with the rest of the help.\n\nZotul found the headquarters of the Merchandising Council as indicated\non their message. He had not been this way in some time, but was not\nsurprised to find that a number of old buildings had been torn down to\nmake room for the concrete Council House and a roomy parking lot, paved\nwith something called \"blacktop\" and jammed with an array of glittering\nnew automobiles.\n\nAn automobile was an expense none of the brothers could afford, now\nthat they barely eked a living from the pottery. Still, Zotul ached\nwith desire at sight of so many shiny cars. Only a few had them and\nthey were the envied ones of Zur.\n\nKent Broderick, the Earthman in charge of the Council, shook hands\njovially with Zotul. That alien custom conformed with, Zotul took a\nbetter look at his host. Broderick was an affable, smiling individual\nwith genial laugh wrinkles at his eyes. A man of middle age, dressed in\nthe baggy costume of Zur, he looked almost like a Zurian, except for\nan indefinite sense of alienness about him.\n\n\"Glad to have you call on us, Mr. Masur,\" boomed the Earthman, clapping\nZotul on the back. \"Just tell us your troubles and we'll have you\nstraightened out in no time.\"\n\n\n\nAll the chill recriminations and arguments Zotul had stored for this\noccasion were dissipated in the warmth of the Earthman's manner.\n\nAlmost apologetically, Zotul told of the encroachment that had been\nmade upon the business of the Pottery of Masur.\n\n\"Once,\" he said formally, \"the Masur fortune was the greatest in\nthe world of Zur. That was before my father, the famous Kalrab\nMasur--Divinity protect him--departed this life to collect his greater\nreward. He often told us, my father did, that the clay is the flesh and\nbones of our culture and our fortune. Now it has been shown how prone\nis the flesh to corruption and how feeble the bones. We are ruined, and\nall because of new things coming from Earth.\"\n\nBroderick stroked his shaven chin and looked sad. \"Why didn't you come\nto me sooner? This would never have happened. But now that it has,\nwe're going to do right by you. That is the policy of Earth--always to\ndo right by the customer.\"\n\n\"Divinity witness,\" Zorin said, \"that we ask only compensation for\ndamages.\"\n\nBroderick shook his head. \"It is not possible to replace an immense\nfortune at this late date. As I said, you should have reported your\ntrouble sooner. However, we can give you an opportunity to rebuild. Do\nyou own an automobile?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"A gas range? A gas-fired furnace? A radio?\"\n\nZotul had to answer no to all except the radio. \"My wife Lania likes\nthe music,\" he explained. \"I cannot afford the other things.\"\n\nBroderick clucked sympathetically. One who could not afford the\nbargain-priced merchandise of Earth must be poor indeed.\n\n\"To begin with,\" he said, \"I am going to make you a gift of all these\nluxuries you do not have.\" As Zotul made to protest, he cut him off\nwith a wave of his hand. \"It is the least we can do for you. Pick a car\nfrom the lot outside. I will arrange to have the other things delivered\nand installed in your home.\"\n\n\"To receive gifts,\" said Zotul, \"incurs an obligation.\"\n\n\"None at all,\" beamed the Earthman cheerily. \"Every item is given to\nyou absolutely free--a gift from the people of Earth. All we ask is\nthat you pay the freight charges on the items. Our purpose is not to\nmake profit, but to spread technology and prosperity throughout the\nGalaxy. We have already done well on numerous worlds, but working out\nthe full program takes time.\"\n\nHe chuckled deeply. \"We of Earth have a saying about one of our\nextremely slow-moving native animals. We say, 'Slow is the tortoise,\nbut sure.' And so with us. Our goal is a long-range one, with the\nmotto, 'Better times with better merchandise.'\"\n\n\n\nThe engaging manner of the man won Zotul's confidence. After all, it\nwas no more than fair to pay transportation.\n\nHe said, \"How much does the freight cost?\"\n\nBroderick told him.\n\n\"It may seem high,\" said the Earthman, \"but remember that Earth is\nsixty-odd light-years away. After all, we are absorbing the cost of the\nmerchandise. All you pay is the freight, which is cheap, considering\nthe cost of operating an interstellar spaceship.\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" said Zotul drably. \"Not I and all my brothers together\nhave so much money any more.\"\n\n\"You don't know us of Earth very well yet, but you will. I offer you\ncredit!\"\n\n\"What is that?\" asked Zotul skeptically.\n\n\"It is how the poor are enabled to enjoy all the luxuries of the\nrich,\" said Broderick, and went on to give a thumbnail sketch of the\ninvolutions and devolutions of credit, leaving out some angles that\nmight have had a discouraging effect.\n\nOn a world where credit was a totally new concept, it was enchanting.\nZotul grasped at the glittering promise with avidity. \"What must I do\nto get credit?\"\n\n\"Just sign this paper,\" said Broderick, \"and you become part of our\nEasy Payment Plan.\"\n\nZotul drew back. \"I have five brothers. If I took all these things for\nmyself and nothing for them, they would beat me black and blue.\"\n\n\"Here.\" Broderick handed him a sheaf of chattel mortgages. \"Have each\nof your brothers sign one of these, then bring them back to me. That is\nall there is to it.\"\n\nIt sounded wonderful. But how would the brothers take it? Zotul\nwrestled with his misgivings and the misgivings won.\n\n\"I will talk it over with them,\" he said. \"Give me the total so I will\nhave the figures.\"\n\nThe total was more than it ought to be by simple addition. Zotul\npointed this out politely.\n\n\"Interest,\" Broderick explained. \"A mere fifteen per cent. After all,\nyou get the merchandise free. The transportation company has to be\npaid, so another company loans you the money to pay for the freight.\nThis small extra sum pays the lending company for its trouble.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Zotul puzzled over it sadly. \"It is too much,\" he said. \"Our\nplant doesn't make enough money for us to meet the payments.\"\n\n\"I have a surprise for you,\" smiled Broderick. \"Here is a contract. You\nwill start making ceramic parts for automobile spark plugs and certain\nparts for radios and gas ranges. It is our policy to encourage local\nmanufacture to help bring prices down.\"\n\n\"We haven't the equipment.\"\n\n\"We will equip your plant,\" beamed Broderick. \"It will require only\na quarter interest in your plant itself, assigned to our terrestrial\ncompany.\"\n\n\n\nZotul, anxious to possess the treasures promised by the Earthman,\nwon over his brothers. They signed with marks and gave up a quarter\ninterest in the Pottery of Masur. They rolled in the luxuries of Earth.\nThese, who had never known debt before, were in it up to their ears.\n\nThe retooled plant forged ahead and profits began to look up, but the\nEarthmen took a fourth of them as their share in the industry.\n\nFor a year, the brothers drove their shiny new cars about on the\nnew concrete highways the Earthmen had built. From pumps owned by a\nterrestrial company, they bought gas and oil that had been drawn from\nthe crust of Zur and was sold to the Zurians at a magnificent profit.\nThe food they ate was cooked in Earthly pots on Earth-type gas ranges,\nserved up on metal plates that had been stamped out on Earth. In the\nwinter, they toasted their shins before handsome gas grates, though\nthey had gas-fired central heating.\n\nAbout this time, the ships from Earth brought steam-powered electric\ngenerators. Lines went up, power was generated, and a flood of\nelectrical gadgets and appliances hit the market. For some reason,\nbatteries for the radios were no longer available and everybody had to\nbuy the new radios. And who could do without a radio in this modern age?\n\nThe homes of the brothers Masur blossomed on the Easy Payment Plan.\nThey had refrigerators, washers, driers, toasters, grills, electric\nfans, air-conditioning equipment and everything else Earth could\npossibly sell them.\n\n\"We will be forty years paying it all off,\" exulted Zotul, \"but\nmeantime we have the things and aren't they worth it?\"\n\nBut at the end of three years, the Earthmen dropped their option.\nThe Pottery of Masur had no more contracts. Business languished. The\nEarthmen, explained Broderick, had built a plant of their own because\nit was so much more efficient--and to lower prices, which was Earth's\nunswerving policy, greater and greater efficiency was demanded.\nBroderick was very sympathetic, but there was nothing he could do.\n\nThe introduction of television provided a further calamity. The sets\nwere delicate and needed frequent repairs, hence were costly to own and\nmaintain. But all Zurians who had to keep up with the latest from Earth\nhad them. Now it was possible not only to hear about things of Earth,\nbut to see them as they were broadcast from the video tapes.\n\nThe printing plants that turned out mortgage contracts did a lush\nbusiness.\n\n\n\nFor the common people of Zur, times were good everywhere. In a decade\nand a half, the Earthmen had wrought magnificent changes on this\nbackward world. As Broderick had said, the progress of the tortoise was\nslow, but it was extremely sure.\n\nThe brothers Masur got along in spite of dropped options. They had less\nmoney and felt the pinch of their debts more keenly, but television\nkept their wives and children amused and furnished an anodyne for the\npangs of impoverishment.\n\nThe pottery income dropped to an impossible low, no matter how Zotul\ndesigned and the brothers produced. Their figurines and religious ikons\nwere a drug on the market. The Earthmen made them of plastic and sold\nthem for less.\n\nThe brothers, unable to meet the Payments that were not so Easy any\nmore, looked up Zotul and cuffed him around reproachfully.\n\n\"You got us into this,\" they said, emphasizing their bitterness with\nfists. \"Go see Broderick. Tell him we are undone and must have some\ncontracts to continue operating.\"\n\nNursing bruises, Zotul unhappily went to the Council House again. Mr.\nBroderick was no longer with them, a suave assistant informed him.\nWould he like to see Mr. Siwicki instead? Zotul would.\n\nSiwicki was tall, thin, dark and somber-looking. There was even a hint\nof toughness about the set of his jaw and the hardness of his glance.\n\n\"So you can't pay,\" he said, tapping his teeth with a pencil. He\nlooked at Zotul coldly. \"It is well you have come to us instead of\nmaking it necessary for us to approach you through the courts.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" said Zotul.\n\n\"If we have to sue, we take back the merchandise and everything\nattached to them. That means you would lose your houses, for they are\nattached to the furnaces. However, it is not as bad as that--yet. We\nwill only require you to assign the remaining three-quarters of your\npottery to us.\"\n\nThe brothers, when they heard of this, were too stunned to think of\nbeating Zotul, by which he assumed he had progressed a little and was\nsomewhat comforted.\n\n\"To fail,\" said Koltan soberly, \"is not a Masur attribute. Go to the\ngovernor and tell him what we think of this business. The House of\nMasur has long supported the government with heavy taxes. Now it is\ntime for the government to do something for us.\"\n\n\n\nThe governor's palace was jammed with hurrying people, a scene of\nconfusion that upset Zotul. The clerk who took his application for\nan interview was, he noticed only vaguely, a young Earthwoman. It\nwas remarkable that he paid so little attention, for the female\nterrestrials were picked for physical assets that made Zurian men\ncovetous and Zurian women envious.\n\n\"The governor will see you,\" she said sweetly. \"He has been expecting\nyou.\"\n\n\"Me?\" marveled Zotul.\n\nShe ushered him into the magnificent private office of the governor\nof Lor. The man behind the desk stood up, extended his hand with a\nfriendly smile.\n\n\"Come in, come in! I'm glad to see you again.\"\n\nZotul stared blankly. This was not the governor. This was Broderick,\nthe Earthman.\n\n\"I--I came to see the governor,\" he said in confusion.\n\nBroderick nodded agreeably. \"I am the governor and I am well acquainted\nwith your case, Mr. Masur. Shall we talk it over? Please sit down.\"\n\n\"I don't understand. The Earthmen....\" Zotul paused, coloring. \"We are\nabout to lose our plant.\"\n\n\"You were about to say that the Earthmen are taking your plant away\nfrom you. That is true. Since the House of Masur was the largest and\nrichest on Zur, it has taken a long time--the longest of all, in fact.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Yours is the last business on Zur to be taken over by us. We have\nbought you out.\"\n\n\"Our government....\"\n\n\"Your governments belong to us, too,\" said Broderick. \"When they could\nnot pay for the roads, the telegraphs, the civic improvements, we took\nthem over, just as we are taking you over.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" exclaimed Zotul, aghast, \"that you Earthmen own everything\non Zur?\"\n\n\"Even your armies.\"\n\n\"But _why_?\"\n\n\n\nBroderick clasped his hands behind back, went to the window and stared\ndown moodily into the street.\n\n\"You don't know what an overcrowded world is like,\" he said. \"A street\nlike this, with so few people and vehicles on it, would be impossible\non Earth.\"\n\n\"But it's mobbed,\" protested Zotul. \"It gave me a headache.\"\n\n\"And to us it's almost empty. The pressure of population on Earth has\nmade us range the Galaxy for places to put our extra people. The only\nhabitable planets, unfortunately, are populated ones. We take the least\npopulous worlds and--well, buy them out and move in.\"\n\n\"And after that?\"\n\nBroderick smiled gently. \"Zur will grow. Our people will intermarry\nwith yours. The future population of Zur will be neither true Zurians\nnor true Earthmen, but a mixture of both.\"\n\nZotul sat in silent thought. \"But you did not have to buy us out. You\nhad the power to conquer us, even to destroy us. The whole planet could\nhave been yours alone.\" He stopped in alarm. \"Or am I suggesting an\nidea that didn't occur to you?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Broderick, his usually smiling face almost pained with\nmemory. \"We know the history of conquest all too well. Our method\ncauses more distress than we like to inflict, but it's better--and more\nsure--than war and invasion by force. Now that the unpleasant job is\nfinished, we can repair the dislocations.\"\n\n\"At last I understand what you said about the tortoise.\"\n\n\"Slow but sure.\" Broderick beamed again and clapped Zotul on the\nshoulder. \"Don't worry. You'll have your job back, the same as always,\nbut you'll be working for us ... until the children of Earth and Zur\nare equal in knowledge and therefore equal partners. That's why we had\nto break down your caste system.\"\n\nZotul's eyes widened. \"And that is why my brothers did not beat me when\nI failed!\"\n\n\"Of course. Are you ready now to take the assignment papers for you and\nyour brothers to sign?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Zotul. \"I am ready.\"",
