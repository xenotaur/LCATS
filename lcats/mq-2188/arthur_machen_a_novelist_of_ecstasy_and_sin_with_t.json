Hill\n1918\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n\n\nWith singular unanimity critics for thirty years have slighted the work\nof Arthur Machen. A line suffices for him in Holbrook Jackson's \"The\nEighteen Nineties,\" and Mr. Blaikie-Murdoch ignores him completely in\n\"The Renaissance of the Nineties\"; yet those are the standard works on\nthe period to which, chronologically, at least, Machen belongs. Mr.\nTurquet-Milnes, with greater appreciation, gives him a half-chapter in\nhis scholarly work, \"The Influence of Baudelaire,\" but even that is made\nup largely of quotations from \"The Hill of Dreams,\" to prove Machen a\ndescendent of Baudelaire--an error to which I subscribed until Machen\nhimself disillusioned me, although the assertion is still partially\ntrue.\n\nBecause, in my opinion, Arthur Machen is the outstanding artist of his\ntime, and one of the great masters of all time, I wrote the following\npaper, which first appeared in Reedy's _Mirror_ for October 5, 1917.\nThat issue is not now obtainable, and, as calls for it continue to come\nto me and to the publisher, I find ground for a belief that Machen may,\nat length, be coming into his own, a tardy phenomenon which I am happy\nto hasten so far as it lies within my power. Mr. Walter M. Hill shares\nthis feeling and this brochure is the result.\n\nI am indebted to Mr. William Marion Reedy for permission to reprint\nthose parts of the article which appeared in his journal.\n\nV.S.\n\n\n\n\nARTHUR MACHEN\n\n\nSome thirty odd years ago a young man of twenty-two, the son of a Welsh\nclergyman, fresh from school and with his head full of a curiously\noccult mediaevalism, privately acquired from yellowed palimpsests and\ndog-eared volumes of black letter, wrote a classic. More, he had it\npublished. Only one review copy was sent out; that was to _Le Livre_, of\nParis. It fell into the hands of Octave Uzanne, who instantly ordered\nRabelais and Boccaccio to \"shove over\" on the immortal seats and make\nroom by their side for the author. The book was \"The Chronicle of\nClemendy\"; the author, Arthur Machen.\n\nThree years ago, about, not long after the great war first shook the\nworld, a London evening newspaper published inconspicuously a purely\nfictional account of a supposed incident of the British retreat from\nMons. It described the miraculous intervention of the English archers of\nAgincourt at a time when the British were sore pressed by the German\nhordes. Immediately, churchmen, spiritualists, and a host of others,\nseized upon it as an authentic record and the miracle as an omen. In the\nhysteria that followed, Arthur Machen, its author, found himself a\ntalked-of man, because he wrote to the papers denying that the narrative\nwas factual. Later, when his little volume, \"The Bowmen and Other\nLegends of the War,\" appeared in print, it met with an extraordinary and\nrather impertinent success.\n\nBut what had Machen been doing all those long years between 1885 and\n1914?\n\nIn a day of haphazard fiction and rodomontade criticism, the advent of a\nmaster workman is likely to be unheralded, if, indeed, he is fortunate\nenough to find a publisher to put him between covers. Mr. Machen is not\na newcomer, however, as we have seen; no immediate success with a \"best\nseller\" furnishes an incentive for a complimentary notice. He is an\nunknown, in spite of \"Clemendy,\" in spite of \"The Bowmen,\" in spite of\neverything. For thirty years he has been writing English prose, a period\nample for the making of a dozen reputations of the ordinary kind, and in\nthat time he has produced just ten books. In thirty years Harold\nBindloss and Rex Beach will have written one-hundred-and-ten books and\nsold the moving picture rights of them all.\n\nOf course, it is exactly because he does not write books of the ordinary\nkind that Arthur Machen's reputation as a writer was not made long ago.\nHis apotheosis will begin after his death. The insectial fame of the\n\"popular\" novelist is immediate; it is born at dawn and dies at sunset.\nThe enduring fame of the artist too often is born at sunset, but it is\nimmortal.\n\nMore than Hawthorne or Tolstoy, Machen is a novelist of the soul. He\nwrites of a strange borderland, lying somewhere between Dreams and\nDeath, peopled with shades, beings, spirits, ghosts, men, women,\nsouls--what shall we call them?--the very notion of whom stops vaguely\njust short of thought. He writes of the life Satyr-ic. For him Pan is\nnot dead; his votaries still whirl through woodland windings to the mad\npipe that was Syrinx, and carouse fiercely in enchanted forest grottoes\n(hidden somewhere, perhaps, in the fourth dimension!). His meddling with\nthe crucibles of science is appalling in its daring, its magnificence,\nand its horror. Even the greater works of fictional psychology--\"Dr.\nJekyll and Mr. Hyde,\" if you like--shrink before his astounding\ninferences and suggestions.\n\nIt is his theory that the fearful and shocking rites of the Bacchic\ncultus survive in this disillusioned age; that Panic lechery and\nwickedness did not cease with the Agony, as Mrs. Browning and others\nwould have us believe.\n\nOf Hawthorne, Arthur Symons wrote: \"He is haunted by what is obscure,\ndangerous, and on the confines of good and evil.\" Machen crosses those\nperilous frontiers. He all but lifts the veil; himself, indeed, passes\nbeyond it. But the curtain drops behind him and we, hesitating to\nfollow, see only dimly the phantasmagoria beyond; the ecstasies of vague\nshapes with a shining about them, on the one hand; on the other the\nwrithings of animate gargoyles. And we experience, I think, a distinct\nsense of gratitude toward this terrible guide for that we are permitted\nno closer view of the mysteries that seem to him so clear.\n\nWe glimpse his secrets in transfiguring flashes from afar, as Launcelot\nviewed the San Graal, and, like that tarnished knight, we quest vainly a\ntangible solution, half in apprehension, always in glamour. But it is\nlike Galahad we must seek the eternal mysteries that obsess Arthur\nMachen. There is no solution but in absolution, for it is the mysteries\nof life and death of which he writes, and of life-in-death and\ndeath-in-life. This with particular reference to Machen's two most\nimportant books, \"The House of Souls\" and \"The Hill of Dreams,\" in which\nhe reaches his greatest stature as a novelist of the soul.\n\nThere are those who will call him a novelist of Sin, quibbling about a\ndefinition. With these I have no quarrel; the characterizations are\nsynonymous. His books exhale all evil and all corruption; yet they are\nas pure as the fabled waters of that crystal spring De Leon sought. They\nare pervaded by an ever-present, intoxicating sense of sin, ravishingly\nbeautiful, furiously Pagan, frantically lovely; but Machen is a finer\nand truer mystic than the two-penny occultists who guide modern\nspiritualistic thought. If we are to subscribe to his curious\nphilosophy, to be discussed later, we must believe that there is no\nparadox in this.\n\nBut something of what we are getting at is explained in his own pages,\nin this opening paragraph from his story, \"The White People,\" in \"The\nHouse of Souls\": \"'Sorcery and sanctity,' said Ambrose, 'these are the\nonly realities. Each is an ecstasy, a withdrawal from the common life.'\"\nAnd, a little later, in this: \"'There is something profoundly unnatural\nabout sin ... the essence of which really is in the taking of heaven by\nstorm.'\"\n\nOne gathers from a general vagueness on the subject that sin is not\npopular in these times. There are, of course, new sins and advanced sins\nand higher sins, all of which are intensely interesting. The chief\npuzzle to the lay mind is why they should bear these names, since they\nare usually neither new, advanced and high, nor particularly sinful. I\nam speaking of sin as an offense against the nature of things, and of\nevil in the soul, which has very little to do with the sins of the\nstatute book. Sin, according to the same Ambrose I have quoted, is\nconceivable in the talking of animals. If a chair should walk across a\nroom, that would be sinful, or if a tree sat down with us to afternoon\ntea. The savage who worships a conjurer is a far finer moralist than\nthe civilise who suspects him--and I use the name moralist for one who\nhas an appreciation of sin.\n\nThis is not the sin of the legal code. _Ambrose_ I conceive to be Arthur\nMachen. There are only two realities; sorcery and sanctity--sin and\nsainthood--and each is an ecstasy. Arthur Machen's is the former.\n\nPerhaps his most remarkable story--certainly I think his most terrible\nstory, is \"The Great God Pan,\" at first published separately with \"The\nInmost Light\"; now occurring in \"The House of Souls.\" It is the story of\nan experiment upon a girl, as a result of which, for a moment, she is\npermitted a sight of the Great God, beyond the veil, with shocking\nconsequences. Yet it is told with exquisite reticence and grace, and\nwith a plausibility that is as extraordinary as it is immoral. Here is\nthe conclusion of that story:\n\n     \"What I said Mary would see, she saw, but I forgot that no human\n     eyes could look on such a vision with impunity. And I forgot, as I\n     have just said, that when the house of life is thus thrown open,\n     there may enter in that for which we have no name, and human flesh\n     may become the veil of a horror one dare not express.... The\n     blackened face, the hideous form upon the bed, changing and melting\n     before your eyes from woman to man, from man to beast, and from\n     beast to worse than beast, all the strange horror that you\n     witnessed, surprises me but little. What you say the doctor you\n     sent for saw and shuddered at, I noticed long ago; I knew what I\n     had done the moment the child was born, and when it was five years\n     old I surprised it, not once or twice, but several times, with a\n     playmate, you may guess of what kind.... And now Helen is with her\n     companions.\"\n\nThere is the very quintessence of horror in the unutterable suggestion\nof such passages. As for \"The Hill of Dreams,\" I have found its reading\none of the most desolate and appalling experiences in literature.\nReading it, himself, years after publication, its author decided that it\nwas a \"depressing book.\" That is undoubtedly true, but spiritually as\nwell as technically it marks to date the topmost pinnacle of his\ntormented genius. It reaches heights so rarefied that breathing\nliterally becomes painful. To the casual reader this sounds absurd;\nhyperbolical if not hypocritical rant; but in a day when a majority of\ncritics find it difficult to restrain themselves in speaking of Harold\nBell Wright, and place Jeffery Farnol beside Fielding and Thackeray, one\ncannot go far wrong in indulging a few enthusiasms for so genuine an\nartist as Arthur Machen.\n\nOf the reviewers into whose hands fell this remarkable book, in the year\nof its publication, 1907, only one appears to have valued it at its real\nworth--the editor of _The Academy_, who, carried away by the tale and\nits telling, turned out a bit of critical prose which might have been\nlifted from the book, itself. \"There is something sinister in the beauty\nof Mr. Machen's book,\" he wrote. \"It is like some strangely shaped\norchid, the colour of which is fierce and terrible, and its perfume is\nhaunting to suffocation by reason of its intolerable sweetness. The\ncruelty of the book is more savage than any of the cruelty which the\nbook describes. Lucian shuddered at the boys who were deliberately\nhanging an ungainly puppy; he had thrashed the little ruffian who\nkicked the sick cat, before he wrapped himself away from the contact of\nsuch infamy in the shelter of his own imaginings. For in 'The Hill of\nDreams' you seem to be shown a lovely, sensitive boy who has fashioned\nhimself a white palace of beauty in his own mind. He has had time only\nto realize its full beauty when disease lays its cold touch upon him,\nand gathers him into her grasp, until he lies decaying and horrible,\nseeing his own decay and seeing that his decay makes the white palace\nfoul. The boys did not chant songs as they looped the string round the\nneck of the uncouth puppy. Mr. Machen fashions prose out of the\nwrithings of Lucian, who is dear to him: and his prose has the rhythmic\nbeat of some dreadful Oriental instrument, insistent, monotonous,\nhaunting; and still the soft tone of one careful flute sounds on, and\nkeeps the nerves alive to the slow and growing pain of the rhythmic\nbeat. Lucian in ecstacy of worship for the young girl whose lips have\ngiven him a new life, pressed his body against sharp thorns until the\nwhite flesh of his body was red with drops of blood. That, too, is the\nspirit of the book. It is like some dreadful liturgy of self-inflicted\npain, set to measured music: and the cadence of that music becomes\nintolerable by its suave phrasing and perfect modulation. The last long\nchapter with its recurring themes is a masterpiece of prose, and in its\nway unique.\"\n\nAfter that, there would seem to be no need for further comment on \"The\nHill of Dreams.\" But there is--there is!\n\nQuite as important as what Mr. Machen says is his manner of saying it.\nHe possesses an English prose style which in its mystical suggestion and\nbeauty is unlike any other I have encountered. There is ecstacy in his\npages. Joris-Karl Huysmans in a really good translation suggests Machen\nbetter, perhaps, than another; both are debtors to Baudelaire.[1]\n\nThe \"ecstasy\" one finds in Machen's work (of which more anon) is due in\nno small degree to his beautiful English \"style\"--an abominable word.\nBut Machen is no mere word-juggler. His vocabulary, while astonishing\nand extensive, is not affectedly so. Yet his sentences move to sonorous,\nhalf-submerged rhythms, swooning with pagan color and redolent of\nsacerdotal incense. What is the secret of this graceful English method?\nIt is this: he achieves his striking results and effects through his\nnoteworthy gift of selection and arrangement. I had reached this\nconclusion, I think, before I encountered a passage from \"The Hill of\nDreams,\" which clinched it:\n\n     \"Language, he understood, was chiefly important for the beauty of\n     its sounds, by its possession of words resonant, glorious to the\n     ear, by its capacity, when exquisitely arranged, of suggesting\n     wonderful and indefinable impressions, perhaps more ravishing and\n     further removed from the domain of strict thought than the\n     impressions excited by music itself. Here lay hidden the secret of\n     suggestion, the art of causing sensation by the use of words.\"\n\nWas it ever better expressed? He defines his method and exhibits its\nresults at the same time. And dipping almost at random into the same\nvolume, here is a further example of the method:\n\n     \"Slowly and timidly he began to untie his boots, fumbling with the\n     laces, and glancing all the while on every side at the ugly,\n     misshapen trees that hedged the lawn. Not a branch was straight,\n     not one was free, but all were interlaced and grew one about\n     another; and just above ground, where the cankered stems joined the\n     protuberant roots, there were forms that imitated the human shape,\n     and faces and twining limbs that amazed him. Green mosses were\n     hair, and tresses were stark in grey lichen; a twisted root swelled\n     into a limb; in the hollows of the rooted bark he saw the masks of\n     men.... As he gazed across the turf and into the thicket, the\n     sunshine seemed really to become green, and the contrast between\n     the bright glow poured on the lawn and the black shadows of the\n     brake made an odd flickering light in which all the grotesque\n     postures of stem and root began to stir; the wood was alive. The\n     turf beneath him heaved and sunk as with the deep swell of the\n     sea....\"\n\nAnd:\n\n     \"He could imagine a man who was able to live on one sense while he\n     pleased; to whom, for example, every impression of touch, taste,\n     hearing, or seeing should be translated into odor; who at the\n     desired kiss should be ravished with the scent of dark violets, to\n     whom music should be the perfume of a rose garden at dawn.\"\n\nThis is not prose at all, but poetry, and poetry of a high order. And it\nis from such beautiful manipulation of words, phrases, and rhythms that\nMachen attains his most clairvoyant and arresting effects in the realms\nof horror, dread, and terror; from the strange gesturings of trees, the\nglow of furnace-like clouds, the somber beauty of brooding fields, and\nvalleys all too still, the mystery of lovely women, and all the terror\nof life and nature seen with the understanding eye.\n\nSo much for Arthur Machen as a novelist. It is a fascinating subject,\nbut it is also an extensive one, and the curious, tenuous quality of his\nwork may lead one into indiscretions.\n\n\n\nThe peculiar philosophy of Arthur Machen is set down in \"Hieroglyphics\"\nand in \"Dr. Stiggins: His Views and Principles.\" The first chapter of\nthe latter work is a scathing satire on certain foibles and\nidiosyncracies of the American people--such as lynching, vote-buying,\nand food-adulteration--but as it is, on the whole, a polemical volume\nwhich, by the nature of the subjects it treats, can have less permanent\ninterest than the author's other work, it may be put to one side;\nalthough as a specimen of Machen's impeccable prose it must not be\nignored.\n\nIn \"Hieroglyphics\" he returns to those ecstasies mentioned in \"The White\nPeople\" and gives us further definitions. The word ecstasy is merely a\nsymbol; it has many synonyms. It means rapture, adoration, a withdrawal\nfrom common life, the other things. \"Who can furnish a precise\ndefinition of the indefinable? They (the 'other things') are sometimes\nin the song of a bird, sometimes in the whirl of a London street,\nsometimes hidden under a great, lonely hill. Some of us seek them with\nmost hope and the fullest assurance in the sacring of the mass, others\nreceive tidings through the sound of music, in the color of a picture,\nin the shining form of a statue, in the meditation of eternal truth.\"\n\n\"Hieroglyphics\" is Arthur Machen's theory of literature, brilliantly\nexposited by that \"cyclical mode of discoursing\" that was affected by\nColeridge. In it he promulgates the admirable doctrine that fine\nliterature must be, in effect, an allegory and not the careful history\nof particular persons. He seeks a mark of division which is to separate\nfine literature from mere literature, and finds the solution in the one\nword ecstasy (or, if you prefer, beauty, wonder, awe, mystery, sense of\nthe unknown, desire for the unknown), with this conclusion: \"If ecstasy\nbe present, then I say there is fine literature, if it be absent, then,\nin spite of all the cleverness, all the talents, all the workmanship and\nobservation and dexterity you may show me, then, I think, we have a\nproduct (possibly a very interesting one) which is not fine literature.\"\n\nFollowing this reasoning, by an astonishing sequence of arguments, he\nproceeds to the bold experiment of proving \"Pickwick\" possessed of\necstasy, and \"Vanity Fair\" lacking it. The case is an extreme one, he\nadmits, deliberately chosen to expound his theory to the _n_th. degree.\nThe analytical key to the test is found in the differentiation between\nart and artifice, a nice problem in such extreme instances as Poe's\n\"Dupin\" stories and Stevenson's \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\" as Mr. Machen\npoints out. By this ingenious method the \"Odyssey,\" \"Oedipus,\" \"Morte\nD'Arthur,\" \"Kubla Khan,\" \"Don Quixote,\" and \"Rabelais\" immediately are\nproven fine literature; a host of other esteemed works merely, if you\nlike, good literature.\n\n\"Pantagruel\" by a more delicate application of the test becomes a finer\nwork than \"Don Quixote,\" and in the exposition of this dictum we come\nupon one of the mountain peaks of Machen's amazing philosophy.\n\nHe begins the discussion with a jest about the enormous capacity for\nstrong drink exhibited by _Mr. Pickwick_ and his friends, and reminds us\nthat it was the god of wine in whose honor Sophocles wrote his dramas\nand choral songs, who was worshipped and invoked at the Dionysiaca; and\nthat all the drama arose from the celebration of the Bacchic mysteries.\nHe goes on to the \"Gargantua\" and \"Pantagruel,\" which reek of wine as\nDickens does of brandy and water.\n\nThe Rabelaisian history begins: \"_Grandgousier estoit bon raillard en\nson temps, aimant a boire net_,\" and ends with the Oracle of the Holy\nBottle, with the word \"_Trinch ... un mot panomphee, celebre et entendu\nde toutes nations, et nous signifie, beuvez_.\" \"And I refer you,\"\ncontinues Machen, \"to the allocution of Bacbuc, the priestess of the\nBottle, at large. 'By wine,' she says, 'is man made divine,' and I may\nsay that if you have not got the key to these Rabelaisian riddles, much\nof the value--the highest value--of the book is lost to you.\"\n\nSeeking the meaning of this Bacchic cultus, this apparent glorification\nof drunkenness in all lands and in all times, from Ancient Greece\nthrough Renascent France to Victorian England, by peoples and persons\nnot themselves given to excess, he finds it again in the word ecstasy.\n\n     \"We are to conclude that both the ancient people and the modern\n     writers recognized ecstasy as the supreme gift and state of man,\n     and that they chose the Vine and the juice of the Vine, as the most\n     beautiful and significant symbol of that Power which withdraws a\n     man from the common life and the common consciousness, and taking\n     him from the dust of earth, sets him in high places, in the\n     eternal world of ideas ... Let us never forget that the essence of\n     the book ('Pantagruel') is in its splendid celebration of ecstasy,\n     under the figure of the Vine.\"\n\nAt this point Mr. Machen places the \"key\" in our hands and declines\nfurther to reveal his secrets. In _Mr. Pickwick's_ overdose of milk\npunch we are to find, ultimately, \"a clue to the labyrinth of mystic\ntheology.\"\n\nBy his own test we are enabled to place Arthur Machen's greatest works\non the shelf with \"Don Quixote\" and \"Pantagruel\"; by his own test we\nfind the ecstasy of which he speaks in his own pages, under the symbol\nof the Vine, and under figures even more beautiful and terrible. For\nminor consideration he finds in Rabelais another symbolism of ecstasy:\n\n     \"The shape of gauloiserie, of gross, exuberant gaiety, expressing\n     itself by outrageous tales, outrageous words, by a very cataract of\n     obscenity, if you please, if only you will notice how the obscenity\n     of Rabelais transcends the obscenity of common life; his grossness\n     is poured out in a sort of mad torrent, in a frenzy, a very passion\n     of the unspeakable.\"\n\nIn Cervantes he finds the greater deftness, the finer artifice, but he\nbelieves the conception of Rabelais the higher because it is the more\nremote. _Pantagruel's_ \"more than frankness, its ebullition of grossness\n... is either the merest lunacy, or else it is sublime.\" And the\nparagraph that succeeds this one in the book, perhaps it is part of the\nsame paragraph, sums up this astonishing philosophy with a conclusion\ncalculated to shock the Puritanic. Thus:\n\n     \"Don't you perceive that when a certain depth has been passed you\n     begin to ascend into the heights? The Persian poet expresses the\n     most transcendental secrets of the Divine Love by the grossest\n     phrases of the carnal love; so Rabelais soars above the common\n     life, above the streets and the gutter, by going far lower than the\n     streets and the gutter: he brings before you the highest by\n     positing that which is lower than the lowest, and if you have the\n     prepared, initiated mind, a Rabelaisian 'list' is the best preface\n     to the angelic song. (!) All this may strike you as extreme\n     paradox, but it has the disadvantage of being true, and perhaps you\n     may assure yourself of its truth by recollecting the converse\n     proposition--that it is when one is absorbed in the highest\n     emotions that the most degrading images will intrude themselves.\"\n\nAnd so on.... The sense of the futility almost of attempting to explain\nMachen becomes more pronounced as I progress. You will have to read him.\nYou will find his books (if you are fortunate) in a murky corner of some\nobscure second-hand bookshop.\n\nArthur Machen was born in Wales in 1863. He is married and has two\nchildren. That is an astonishing thought, after reading \"The Inmost\nLight.\" It is surprising indeed to learn that he was _born_. He is High\nChurch, \"with no particular respect for the Archbishop of Canterbury,\"\nand necessarily subconsciously Catholic, as must be all those \"lonely,\nawful souls\" who write ecstasy across the world. He hates puritanism\nwith a sturdier hatred than inspires Chesterton; for a brilliant\nexposition of this aversion I commend readers to his mocking\nintroduction to \"The House of Souls.\" That work, \"The Hill of Dreams,\"\nand \"Hieroglyphics\" were written between 1890 and 1900, after which\ntheir author turned strolling player and alternated for a time between\nthe smartest theatres in London and the shabbiest music halls in\nLondon's East End. For the last six years or so he has been a\ndescriptive writer on the London _Evening News_.\n\nHis works not before mentioned comprise a translation (the best)\nof the \"Heptameron\"; \"Fantastic Tales,\" a collection of mediaeval\nwhimsies, partly translated and partly original and altogether\nRabelaisian and delightful; \"The Terror,\" a \"shilling shocker\" (his own\ncharacterization), but a finer work withal than most of the \"literature\"\nof the day, and \"The Great Return,\" an extraordinary short tale which\nmay find place some day in another such collection as \"The House of\nSouls.\"\n\nI have mentioned \"The Chronicle of Clemendy,\" calling it a classic, and\nsomething further should be said about that astonishing book. It is the\nWelsh \"Heptameron,\" a chronicle of amorous intrigue, joyous drunkenness,\nand knightly endeavor second to none in the brief muster of the world's\ngreatest classics. In it there is the veritable flavour of mediaeval\nrecord. Somewhat less outspoken than Balzac in his \"Droll Stories,\" and\nless verbose than Boccaccio, Machen proves himself the peer of either in\ngay, irresponsible, diverting, unflagging invention, while his diction\nis lovelier than that of any of his forerunners, including the nameless\nauthors of those rich Arabian tapestries which were the parent tales of\nall mediaeval and modern facetiae.\n\nThe day is coming when a number of serious charges will be laid against\nus who live in this generation, and some severe questions asked, and the\nfact that we will be dead, most of us, when the future fires its\nbroadside, has nothing at all to do with the case.\n\nWe are going to be asked, _post-mortem_, why we allowed Ambrose Bierce\nto vanish from our midst, unnoticed and unsought, after ignoring him\nshamefully throughout his career; why Stephen Crane, after a few\nflamboyant reviews, was so quickly forgotten at death; why Richard\nMiddleton was permitted to swallow his poison at Brussels; why W.C.\nMorrow and Walter Blackburn Harte were in our day known only to the\ninitiated, discriminating few; their fine, golden books merely rare\n\"items\" for the collector. Among other things, posterity is going to\ndemand of us why, when the opportunity was ours, we did not open our\nhearts to Arthur Machen and name him among the very great.\n\n\n[Footnote 1: I have let this last assertion stand as part of the original\narticle, although Mr. Machen writes me that I am in error. \"I never read\na line of Baudelaire,\" he says, \"but I have read deeply in Poe, who, I\nbelieve, derives largely from Baudelaire.\" Of course, it is the other\nway 'round, Baudelaire derives from Poe, but my own assumption is\nrendered clear.--V.S.]\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n    THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE BARD\n\n\n    In the darkness of old age let not my memory\n      fail:\n    Let me not forget to celebrate the beloved land\n      of Gwent.\n    If they imprison me in a deep place, in a house\n      of pestilence,\n    Still shall I be free, remembering the sunshine\n      upon Mynydd Maen.\n    There have I listened to the song of the lark,\n      my soul has ascended with the song of the\n      little bird:\n    The great white clouds were the ships of my\n      spirit, sailing to the haven of the Almighty.\n    Equally to be held in honour is the site of the\n      Great Mountain.\n    Adorned with the gushing of many waters--\n      sweet is the shade of its hazel thickets.\n    There a treasure is preserved which I will not\n      celebrate;\n    It is glorious and deeply concealed.\n    If Teils should return, if happiness were restored\n      to the Cymri,\n    Dewi and Dyfrig should serve his Mass; then a\n      great marvel would be made visible.\n    O blessed and miraculous work! then should my\n      bliss be as the joy of angels.\n    I had rather behold this offering than kiss the\n      twin lips of dark Gwenllian.\n    Dear my land of Gwent: _O quam dilecta tabernacula_.\n    Thy rivers are like precious golden streams of\n      Paradise, thy hills are as the Mount Syon.\n    Better a grave on Twyn Barlwm than a throne\n      in the palace of the Saxons at Caer-Ludd.\n\n    ARTHUR MACHEN\n\n\n\n\n    THE PRAISE OF MYFANWY\n\n\n    O gift of the everlasting:\n    O wonderful and hidden mystery.\n    Many secrets have been vouchsafed to me,\n    I have been long acquainted with the wisdom\n      of the trees;\n    Ash and oak and elm have communicated to me\n      from my boyhood,\n    The birch and the hazel and all the trees of\n      the greenwood have not been dumb.\n    There is a caldron rimmed with pearls of whose\n      gifts I am not ignorant;\n    I will speak little of it; its treasures are known\n      to the Bards.\n    Many went on the search of Caer-Pedryfan,\n    Seven alone returned with Arthur, but my spirit\n      was present.\n    Seven are the apple-trees in a beautiful orchard;\n    I have eaten of their fruit which is not bestowed\n      on Saxons.\n    I am not ignorant of a Head which is glorious\n      and venerable;\n    It made perpetual entertainment for the warriors,\n      their joys would have been immortal;\n    If they had not opened the door of the south,\n      they would have feasted for ever,\n    Listening to the song of the fairy Birds of\n      Rhiannon.\n    Let not anyone instruct me concerning the Glassy\n      Isle;\n    In the garments of the saints who returned from\n      it were rich odours of Paradise.\n    All this I knew, and yet my knowledge was\n      ignorance.\n    For one day, as I walked by Caer-rhiu in the\n      principal forest of Gwent,\n    I saw golden Myfanwy as she bathed in the\n      brook Tarogi,\n    Her hair flowed about her; Arthur's crown had\n      dissolved into a shining mist.\n    I gazed into her blue eyes as it were into twin\n      heavens,\n    All the parts of her body were adornments and\n      miracles.\n    O gift of the everlasting:\n    O wonderful and hidden mystery:\n    When I embraced Myfanwy a moment became\n      immortality.\n\n    ARTHUR MACHEN",
