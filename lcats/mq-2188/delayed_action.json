    "body": "It was just a hunch. Johnson knew that, but his hunches had often paid\noff in the past, and now he waited with a big man's patience. For five\nhours he sat in the wooden stands, under the rumpled canvas the\nconcessionaires had put up to protect the tourists from Marlock's\nyellow sun.\n\nThe sun was hot and soon Johnson's clothing was marked with large\nsoiled patches of sweat. Now and then a light breeze blew across the\nstands from the native section and at each breath his nostrils\ncrinkled in protest at the acrid smell.\n\nMarlock wasn't much of a planet. Its one claim to fame was its\nwidely advertised Nature's Moebius Strip. For eighteen months of the\nyear--nine months of sub-zero cold, and nine months of sultry,\nsand-driven summer--the only outsiders to visit the planet came to buy\nits one export, the fur of the desert ox. But during the two months of\nfall and two months of spring the tourists poured in to gape at the\nStrip.\n\nIdly, for the hundredth time, Johnson let his gaze run over the\ntourists lining up for their \"thrill\" journey out onto the Strip. Most\nof them wouldn't go far; they only wanted to be able to say they'd\nbeen on it. They would build up some pretty exciting stories about it\nby the time they returned home.\n\nThere was no sign of Johnson's man.\n\n\n\nThe party started out onto the Strip. At the first sensation of\ngiddiness women squealed and most of them turned back. Their men came\nwith them, secretly relieved at the excuse.\n\nJohnson watched disinterestedly until only two remained: the young\ncouple he had designated in his mind as honeymooners. The girl had\ngrit. Perhaps more than the young fellow with her. He was affecting\nbored bravado, laughing loudly as the girl hesitated, but white\nstreaks had appeared along his jawline and across his temples as he\nwaited his turn.\n\nThe young couple had gone far enough out now so that they were in the\nfirst bend of the Strip's twisting dip. Already their bodies were\nleaning sharply, as the mysterious gravity of the Strip held them\nperpendicular with their pathway. From where he sat Johnson could read\nnausea on their faces.\n\nWhen they had followed the Strip around until they were leaning at a\n35-degree angle, the girl seemed to lose her nerve. She stopped and\nstood gripping the guide rope with both hands. The boy said something\nto her, but she shook her head. He'd have to show his superiority now\nby going on, but it wouldn't be for much farther, Johnson was willing\nto wager.\n\nThe boy took three more steps and paused. Then his body bent in the\nmiddle and he was sick. He'd had enough.\n\nBoth turned and hurried back. The crowd of tourists, watching or\nwaiting their turn, cheered. In a few minutes, Johnson knew, the kid\nwould be thinking of himself as a hero.\n\nSuddenly Johnson straightened up, having spotted a new arrival, who\ngripped a tan brief-case tightly under one arm, buying a ticket. He\nhad bulky shoulders and a black beard. Johnson's man had come.\n\nWhen he saw the bearded man go out with the next bunch to brave the\nStrip, Johnson rose and walked rapidly to the entrance. Elbowing his\nway through, with a murmured apology, he joined the waiting group.\n\nA thin-faced odd-job man opened the rope gate and they shuffled\nthrough. The group must have walked fifty paces, with the bearded man\nwell up in front and Johnson somewhere in the middle, before Johnson's\nstomach sent him its first warning of unrest. Most of those ahead had\nstopped and Johnson threaded his way carefully past them.\n\nAnother twenty-five steps and he left the others behind. All except\nthe bearded man. He neither paused nor looked back.\n\nJohnson's stomach had drawn up into a tight knot now, and his head was\nbeginning to feel light. There was a faint ringing in his ears.\n\nBy the time he reached the end of the guide rope, nausea was creeping\nup from his stomach and into his throat. This was as far as it was\nsupposed to be safe to go; the advertising literature had it that here\nwas the point of no return. Up ahead his quarry was walking half\ndoubled over, weaving back and forth, as though he were intoxicated.\nBut he did not pause.\n\nJohnson turned to look back, and felt his breakfast fighting to come\nup. From his perspective, the ground and the spectators watching him\nhad swung to a position almost perpendicular to him. He felt that he\nwas about to slide off into space. A wave of vertigo swept over him,\nhis legs folded and he fell to the ground--sicker than he had ever\nbeen before in his life. Now he knew why the man ahead never looked\nback.\n\nFor a moment Johnson wondered whether he should give up. But, even as\nhe debated, tenacity pulled him to his feet and forced him on.\n\nAnd now something new was added to his vast discomfort. Tiny twinges\nof pain, like small electric shocks, began shooting up his legs,\nincreasing in intensity with each step he took. The pain built up\nuntil the rusty taste of blood in his mouth told him that he had\nbitten into the flesh of his lower lip.\n\nJohnson's only consolation now was the thought that the man ahead of\nhim must be suffering worse than he. At each step the pain increased\nits tempo, and the sound within his head grew to a battering roar.\nAlthough he felt himself at the last frayed ends of his vitality, he\nmanaged to stagger on.\n\nAbruptly he realized that he had very nearly overtaken the man ahead.\nThrough eyes glazed with pain, he saw the other, still standing, but\nswaying with agony and sickness. The man seemed to be gathering his\nresources for some supreme effort.\n\nHe tottered ahead two more steps, threw himself forward--and\ndisappeared!\n\nIf he paused now, Johnson knew he would never be able to move again.\nOnly will power and momentum carried him on. He stumbled and pitched\nforward. A searing pain traced a path through his head and he felt\nhimself falling.\n\n\n\nHe was certain that he had never lost consciousness. The ground came\nup to meet him, and, with a last effort, he twisted his right shoulder\ninward. His cheek slid along the dirt and he lay on his side without\nstrength. His legs pushed forward in a steady jerking movement as he\nfought to quiet his quivering muscles.\n\nGradually a soothing lethargy bathed Johnson's body. His pains\nvanished, and the sickness left his stomach.\n\nBut something was wrong--terribly wrong!\n\nSlowly he climbed to his feet and stood looking about him. He was\nstill on the narrow arm of the Strip. On either side of him banks of\nwhite clouds, with the consistency of thick smoke, billowed and curled\nabout the Strip--but somehow they left its pathway clear.\n\nJohnson shook his head. The wrongness, he guessed, was in his own\nmind. But he was unable to determine what it was. Desperately he\nmarshalled his scattered thoughts. Nothing. He took one groping step\nin the direction from which he had come--and staggered back from a\nwall of pain as tangible as a concrete structure.\n\nHe had no choice except to go forward. There was something he must do,\nhe realized, but what was it? With the question came the answer to\nwhat was troubling him.\n\nHis memory was gone!\n\nOr, at least, a great gap had been torn through it as though carved\nout by a giant blade. Briefly, despair threatened to overwhelm him.\n\n\"Hold it!\" Johnson spoke aloud, and the words sobered him.\n\nAll fears became worse when not looked at. He had to bring this\ndisaster out into the open where he could face it; where he could\nassay the damage. He had always taken pride in having a logical mind,\nwith thought processes as clear and orderly as a bookkeeper's ledger.\nClosing his eyes, he went swiftly over his recollections, placing each\nin its appropriate column.\n\nWhen he finished he found the balance extremely unfavorable, but not\nhopeless. On the asset side he remembered: His name. Donald Johnson.\nRight now he was on Nature's Moebius Strip, on the planet, Marlock.\nThere was some man he had been following.... The rest was on the\nliability side of his balance sheet.\n\n\n\nHis name remained: All other memory of his own identity was gone.\nThere was no recollection of his reason for being on Marlock, or whom\nhe had been following or why. That left him little with which to work.\n\nOn the other hand, he mused, he might never be able to get off the\nStrip, so that didn't matter much. He doubted his ability to stand the\nstress of penetrating that electric curtain again. His body had been\nable to take the punishment the first time because the force had built\nup gradually. Going back would be something else again.\n\nStill he planned his next actions methodically--only in that way could\nhe retain his sanity. He would go forward for one hour, he decided--he\nchecked his wrist watch and discovered it had run down--and, if he\nfound nothing, he would return and take his chances on getting through\nthe curtain.\n\nAt the end of ten minutes he sighted land ahead of him. When he\nstepped off the Strip, he stopped in amazement!\n\nSomehow the Strip had doubled back on itself, and he had returned to\nhis starting place!\n\nTo his right was the rough wooden viewing platform, with its green\numbrella gone. The stands were empty, and not a person--tourist or\nconcessionaire--was in sight.\n\nAs Johnson stood, perplexed, he became aware of numbness spreading\nover his body. He brought up his hands and watched them slowly turn\nblue with cold. He realized then, in a burst of wonder, that winter\nhad come to Marlock. Yet it had been spring when he had gone out on\nthe Strip!\n\n\n\n\"Good God, man!\" the clerk exclaimed. \"Have you been out in that cold\nwithout a coat and hat? It must be thirty below.\"\n\nJohnson was unable to answer. He had run from the Strip--luckily he\nremembered its location in relation to the town--but it must have been\nover a mile to the hotel. Now, as he stamped his feet and beat at his\nsides with numbed hands, he breathed heavily, gasping great gulps of\nair into his tortured lungs.\n\n\"Come and warm yourself,\" the clerk said, leading him over to a hot\nwater radiator.\n\nJohnson made no protest. He let the heat penetrate until it scorched\nthe skin on his back. Only after the coldness left his body and was\nreplaced by a drowsy inertia did his attention return to the clerk.\n\n\"Did you ever see me before?\" Johnson asked.\n\nThe clerk shook his head. \"Not that I know of.\"\n\nAny further investigation would have to wait until the next day,\nJohnson decided. He was dead tired, and he had to have some sleep.\n\"Sign me up for a room, will you?\" he asked.\n\nOnce up in his room, Johnson counted his money. One hundred and\nfifty-four credits. Enough to buy winter clothing and pay his room and\nboard for a week. Maybe two. What would he do if he could learn\nnothing about himself before then?\n\nThe next day Johnson left the hotel to buy warm clothes. The town's\nonly store was a half-block down the street--as he remembered it, one\nof the big Interplanet Company stores.\n\nJohnson waited until the storekeeper finished with two of the\nhairy-eared natives before giving his order. As he paid for the\npurchase, he asked: \"Have you ever seen me before?\"\n\nThe storekeeper glanced at him uneasily, and shifted his feet before\nanswering. \"Am I supposed to have?\"\n\nJohnson ignored the question. \"Where can I find the manager?\" he\nasked, slipping into the heavy coat the clerk held for him.\n\n\"Go up that stairway by the door,\" the clerk said. \"You'll find him in\nhis office.\"\n\n\n\nThe manager was an old man. Old and black, with the deep blackness\nonly an Earth-born Negro possesses. But his eyes retained their\nyouthful alertness.\n\n\"Come in and sit down,\" he told Johnson as he looked up and saw him\nstanding in the doorway.\n\nJohnson walked over and took the chair at the manager's left. \"I've\nhad an accident,\" he said, without preliminary, \"and I seem to have\nlost my memory. Do you, by any chance, know who I am?\"\n\n\"Never saw you before in my life,\" the manager answered. \"What's your\nname?\"\n\n\"Don Johnson.\"\n\n\"Well, at least you remember something,\" the old man said shrewdly.\n\"You didn't come during the last six months, if that'll help any.\nThere've been only two ships in that time. Both the Company's. I meet\nall Company ships. If you came in during the tourist season I wouldn't\nknow.\"\n\n\"Where else could I make inquiries?\"\n\n\"Son,\" the old man said kindly, \"there's three Earthmen on Marlock,\nthat I know of--besides yourself, of course--the clerk at the hotel,\nmy storekeeper, and myself. If you started asking questions at the\nhotel, you're at the end of the line now.\"\n\nSomething in Johnson's expression caused the old man to go on. \"How\nyou fixed for money, son?\"\n\nJohnson drew a deep breath. \"I've got enough to last me about two\nweeks.\"\n\nThe manager hesitated, and carefully surveyed the ceiling with his\neyes before he spoke again. \"I've always felt we Earthmen should stick\ntogether,\" he said. \"If you want a job, I'll find something for you to\ndo and put you on the payroll.\"\n\nTwenty minutes later Johnson took the job--and twenty years later he\nwas still working for the Company. He worked for them until....\n\n\n\nJohnson was glad when the first twinge of fear came that it brought no\npanic. Instead it washed through his body, sharpening his reflexes and\nalerting his muscles for action.\n\nHe never ceased to wonder about this faculty he had acquired for\nsensing the presence of danger. There was no doubt in his mind that it\nhad come into active function through the influence of his\nenvironment. But it must have been an intrinsic part of him even\nbefore that, waiting to be activated.\n\nA moment before he had localized the source of his uneasiness--an\nEarthman, following perhaps fifty paces behind him. The one quick\nglance Johnson had allowed himself told him his follower was above\naverage in height, and lean--with the wiry, muscular command of\nhimself that marked him as a man capable of well-coordinated action.\n\nHe fought the rising force of the next \"sand-blaster\" boiling in from\nthe desert, until he was unable to take a step against it. Then he\nmoved behind a mud-packed arm projecting from the native dwelling at\nhis right. Every building had one of these protecting arms added on;\neven the concrete buildings in the newer, Earth-built section of the\ncity conformed to the custom. The sandstorms raged intermittently on\nMarlock through the entire nine month summer season, and could not be\nignored, either by visitors or natives.\n\nJohnson huddled against the projection, but the sand whipped around\nthe corner and pounded at his back. Fine grains sifted through his\nclothing and mingled with the clammy sweat of his body. He resisted\nthe frantic urge to scratch his itching, tormented skin, for he knew\nthe flesh would be rubbed raw in a minute and increase the irritation\nto maddening proportions.\n\nAs the \"sand-blaster\" lost its intensity, he came out from his shelter\nand walked away as rapidly as the diminishing force of the wind would\npermit. If he could reach his office before his stalker closed in, he\nwould be safe.\n\nSuddenly a second Earthman, a short length of pipe in his right hand,\ncame out of a doorway across the street and ran toward him.\n\nJohnson realized that here was the source of the warning his intuition\nhad sent--not the man behind him.\n\n\n\nFor a brief instant, he weighed the situation. The man was equipped\nfor assault, but the chances were he was interested only in robbery.\nJohnson could probably save himself a beating by surrendering his\nmoney without resistance. He rejected the thought. A man had to live\nwith his pride, and his self-respect; they were more necessary than\nphysical well-being. Setting his shoulders firmly against the wall,\nhe waited.\n\nThe man slowed to a walk when he saw his intended victim on guard.\nJohnson had the chance to observe him closely. He was a short and dark\nman, heavy of bone, with the lower half of his face thickly bearded,\nand sweat making a thin glistening film on his high cheekbones.\n\nAbruptly a voice said, \"I wouldn't touch him if I were you.\"\n\nJohnson followed the gaze of his near-attacker to his left where the\nlean man he had noted before stood with a flat blue pistol pointed in\ntheir direction. He held the pistol like a man who knew how to use it.\n\n\"A gun!\" the man in the street gasped. \"Are you crazy?\"\n\n\"Better put it away--fast,\" Johnson warned his ally. \"If the native\npolice catch you with that gun, you're in bad trouble.\"\n\nThe lean man hesitated a moment, then shrugged and pocketed the gun.\nBut he kept his hand in the pocket. \"I can still use it,\" he said, to\nno one in particular.\n\n\"Look, chum,\" the bearded thug grated. \"You're evidently a stranger\nhere. Let me give you a tip. If you get caught using a gun, or even\nhaving one on you, the police'll slap you in jail with an automatic\nsentence of ten years. An Earthman couldn't stay alive in one of\ntheir so-called jails for a year.\n\n\"Now I've got a little business to attend to with Mr. Johnson, and I\ndon't want any interference. So be smart and run along.\"\n\nThe smile never left the stranger's face. \"Right now,\" he said, \"I am\ninterested in seeing that Mr. Johnson remains in good health. If you\ntake another step toward him, I'll shoot. And, if I'm not successful\nin evading the police afterwards, you won't be alive to know it.\"\n\n\"You're bluffing,\" the bearded man said. \"I....\"\n\n\"Let me point out something,\" Johnson interrupted. \"Suppose he is\nbluffing and doesn't use the gun: The odds are still two to one\nagainst you. Are you sure you could handle both of us--even with the\nhelp of that pipe?\"\n\nThe man wasn't sure. He stood undecided, then his face showed black\nfrustration. He mouthed a few choice phrases through his beard, turned\nand walked away.\n\n\n\nThe lean man extended his hand. \"My name's Alton Hawkes.\"\n\nThe rising whine of the next \"sand-blaster\" drowned out Johnson's\nanswer. He drew his new acquaintance into the shelter of a sand-arm.\n\nAs they hugged the corner, they felt a third body press against them.\nThe musky odor, mingled with the taint of old leather, told Johnson\nthat their companion was a native.\n\nThe storm eased its force and the two Earthmen raised their heads to\nregard the corner's other occupant. He was a mahogany brown, almost\nthe exact color of the ankle-length leather skirt he wore. \"Man, he\nstinks!\" Hawkes said.\n\nTheir visitor spread his hairy, wide-nostriled nose into the native\nequivalent of a smile. His hairy ears twitched with pleasure and he\nswelled his chest. \"Blee strong all over,\" he said. \"Want him guard?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Johnson answered, glancing inquiringly at Hawkes. He\nslipped a coin into the extended brown palm. \"Guard us until we get to\nthe big-house section.\"\n\n\"Pale-smells be very safe,\" the native said.\n\nThey left their shelter as the wind died down and started toward the\ntaller buildings of the foreign section. \"I must have said the right\nthing when I said he stinks,\" Hawkes remarked.\n\n\"Telling a native that is the same thing, to him, as calling him\nstrong and virile,\" Johnson answered. \"They admit, reluctantly, that\nwe foreigners have some good fighting qualities, but we're still\nregarded as unmanly because of our weak odor. Their females wouldn't\nlook twice at either of us.\"\n\nWhen they reached one of the few three-story structures in the city,\nJohnson dismissed their guard. They entered the building and walked\ndown a short corridor and through a door lettered:\n\n                         DONALD H. JOHNSON\n\n                         District Manager\n\n                     Interplanets Trade Company\n\n\"To be frank with you,\" Hawkes said, as he eased his lank body into\nthe chair Johnson offered, \"I had planned to learn more about your\nlocal activities before I introduced myself. However, I've found in\nthe past that my first judgment of a man is usually right, so I think\nI'll get down to business immediately.\" He drew a set of papers from\nan inside pocket and tossed them on the desk in front of Johnson. \"I'm\na Company Secret Service man,\" he said.\n\n\n\nJohnson raised his eyebrows, but looked at the papers without comment.\nHe glanced up at Hawkes.\n\n\"Do you recognize either of the men in the pictures?\" Hawkes asked,\nwhen he saw that Johnson had no intention of speaking.\n\nUnhurriedly Johnson picked up the papers and removed a rubber binder.\nHe pulled out two photos and laid them on the desk in front of him.\n\"The bearded one is the man who waylaid me,\" he said. \"Of course.\"\n\n\"Look at both a little closer,\" Hawkes suggested, \"and see if you\ndon't notice something else.\"\n\nJohnson studied the pictures. \"There's no doubt about the first,\" he\nmurmured. \"Evidently I'm supposed to recognize the other also.\"\nAbruptly he sat erect. \"They're both the same man,\" he exclaimed.\n\"Only in the second picture he's clean-shaven.\"\n\nHawkes nodded. \"There's a story about those two pictures,\" he said.\n\"But first, let me fill you in on some background. You know that\nInterplanets has branches on more than a thousand worlds. Because of\nthis widespread operation it's particularly vulnerable to robbery. But\nit would cost more than the Company's earnings to post adequate guards\non every station. And it would be impractical to depend on the\nprotection of the local governments, many of which are extremely\nprimitive. On the other hand, allowing themselves to be robbed with\nimpunity would be financial suicide.\"\n\nJohnson nodded. \"Of course.\"\n\n\"That,\" Hawkes continued, \"is where the Company's Secret Service\ncomes in. It never lets up on the effort it will make to solve a\nrobbery and bring the perpetrators to justice. And it never quits,\nonce it begins an investigation. That policy has proven very effective\nin discouraging thievery. During the Company's entire tenure there\nhave been less than a dozen unsolved thefts--and two of them occurred\nright here on Marlock.\"\n\n\"I was a clerk with the Company at the time of the second,\" Johnson\nsaid reminiscently. \"Been with them about three years then. That must\nhave been over twenty years ago. I....\" He paused and looked down. \"I\nremember,\" he said. \"The picture without the beard.... That's the\nthief. The photograph was taken by one of the automatic cameras set up\nfor just that purpose; we still use them. But they never found the\nman.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Hawkes agreed. \"That robbery occurred a little over\ntwenty years ago. And the other picture you have was taken at the time\nof the first robbery--approximately twenty-five years before that.\"\n\n\"But it isn't possible,\" Johnson protested. \"These pictures are of the\nsame man. And there's obviously no twenty-five year spread in age\nbetween them. Unless....\"\n\n\"Unless one is the other's father, or a relative that resembles him\nvery closely?\" Hawkes finished. \"Look at the pictures again. There's\nthe same scar on both foreheads, the same pock-mark on the right\ncheek; our special section has even made measurements of the\ncomparative sizes of the nose, ears and other features. There's no\npossible doubt that the pictures are of the same man.\"\n\n\n\n\"How do you explain it?\" Johnson asked.\n\n\"I don't,\" Hawkes replied quietly. \"That's one of the things I'm here\nto learn. But did you notice this? The man we encountered this\nafternoon was not only the same as the one on those pictures: he still\nlooks the same. We might, for the sake of argument, grant that a man's\nappearance would change only slightly in twenty-five years. But when\nyou add another twenty-three on top of that--and he's still\nunchanged...?\"\n\n\"If you're certain that he's the man, why don't you arrest him?\"\nJohnson asked.\n\n\"Can we arrest a man apparently about thirty years old and accuse him\nof a crime committed forty-eight years ago--or even twenty-three years\nago?\"\n\n\"I suppose not,\" Johnson agreed. \"What do you intend to do?\"\n\n\"I haven't decided yet. First I'll have to learn more about the\nsituation here. You can help me with that. Right now I'd like to know\nsomething about the native customs--especially in regard to legal\nmatters.\"\n\n\"Their laws are fairly simple,\" Johnson began. \"There's no law against\nstealing or taking by force anything you can get away with. That\nsounds absurd by Earth standards, it prevents the amassing of more\ngoods than an individual needs, and makes for fairly equitable\ndistribution. If a native somehow acquires a sudden amount of\nwealth--goods, in their case--he must hire guards to protect it.\nGuarding is a major occupation. They do an especially big business\nduring the tourist seasons. In time the pay of the guards will eat up\nany native's surplus. Either way--by loss or guard pay--the wealth is\nsoon redistributed.\"\n\n\"Can they even kill one another with impunity?\"\n\n\"No. Their laws are rigid in that respect. In the process\nof--relieving another of his property, they must neither break a major\nbone, nor inflict permanent damage. If they disobey, they are tortured\nto death in the public square.\"\n\nHawkes asked, \"Who enforces their law?\"\n\n\"One of the clans. Its members are supported in their duties by all\nthe others. And there's a permanent open season on murderers. Anyone,\npolice or civilian may revenge a victim.\"\n\n\"How about the law against carrying firearms?\"\n\n\"With them, intent is tantamount to commission,\" Johnson replied.\n\"Only foreigners are ever foolish enough to be caught armed. However,\nall native laws apply to them also. The only concession the Company\nhas been able to force is that a foreign offender isn't tortured: He's\nput in jail for ten years. None ever live to come out.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Hawkes said. \"Interesting. However, the immediate situation\nis this. I've been sent here because the Service received reports that\nour bearded friend had made another appearance. And we believe it's\nsafe to assume that he's here to attempt a third robbery. Right now\nwe'll have to pass over his trick of longevity. Our problem is to\ncatch him in the act. When do you think he'll make his play?\"\n\n\"It'll have to be some time before tomorrow noon,\" Johnson answered.\n\"Under our setup we accept furs from the natives whenever they're\nbrought in. But we pay off only once a year. That way I'm not burdened\nwith guarding money the whole year around. I have well over fifty\nthousand credits in the safe now. And tomorrow I begin paying off.\"\n\n\"Then we'll have to be ready for him,\" Hawkes said, \"though I don't\nexpect him until tonight. Probably just about the time you're ready to\nclose. He'll need you to open the safe. I can count on your help?\"\n\nJohnson nodded.\n\n\n\nThat night as they waited in his office, Johnson turned to Hawkes.\n\"I've been giving some thought to what you told me this afternoon\nabout the robberies. I have a theory that might account for some of\nthe things we don't understand.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Hawkes looked closely at Johnson.\n\n\"You've probably heard of our tourist attraction called Nature's\nMoebius Strip? As far as we know, no one has ever gone beyond a\ncertain point--and returned. Suppose there's a time flaw at that\npoint--and the bearded man has somehow learned about it. Suppose\nanyone completing the Moebius circle, and returning, finds--say,\ntwenty years have elapsed, while to him only a few minutes have\npassed?\"\n\n\"Go on.\" Hawkes leaned forward intently.\n\n\"He makes his first holdup,\" Johnson continued, \"and goes around the\nStrip. When he comes out twenty years later they're no longer looking\nfor him. He leaves Marlock, and during the next five years he goes\nthrough the money he stole. He returns and repeats the process. This\ntime the money lasts only three years. Now he's back to try it again.\nDo you see how that would tie everything up in a neat little package?\"\n\nHawkes smiled, as he relaxed and sat back. \"A bit too neat,\" he said.\n\"Also, you don't have an ounce of concrete evidence to back up your\ntheory.\"\n\n\"That's right. I don't,\" Johnson agreed.\n\nOutside the door a board creaked. Johnson glanced quickly across the\nroom to where Hawkes sat with a pistol on his lap. Hawkes' eyebrows\nraised, but he made no sound.\n\n\n\nSuddenly the door was kicked open and the black-bearded stranger stood\nframed in the doorway. \"Raise 'em!\" he barked. The gun in his hand was\naimed at Johnson.\n\nThe man took two steps into the room. Hawkes shifted slightly in his\nchair and the gunman's head swiveled in his direction. The slug from\nHawkes' pistol made a small blue hole in the upper left corner of his\nforehead.\n\nThe thug's face tipped up, shocked and unbelieving. He swayed slowly\nbefore he fell backward, his body rigid. His fur cap flew from his\nhead as he struck the floor.\n\n\"I thought we'd better play it safe,\" Hawkes said as he rose and\nwalked over to the fallen man. He slipped his gun into his pocket\nbefore he bent and picked up the cap at his feet. He dropped it over\nthe upturned face.\n\nFor a long moment the silence held thin as the two men looked at each\nother. Hawkes stood, wiping his right hand on his trouser leg. Johnson\ntoyed idly with the gun he had picked up from the desk in front of\nhim.\n\nFinally Hawkes let his body sag into a chair at Johnson's right. \"This\nis always a dirty business,\" he said sourly.\n\nJohnson sat down also. \"Did you notice the look on his face when he\nsaw you, and you shot him?\" he asked, abstractedly turning the pistol\nin his hand. \"Funny thing. In that half-second before he fell an\narticle I read somewhere flashed into my mind. It seems that during\nthe French Revolution a certain doctor got to wondering just how long\na man's brain remained active after his head had been cut off. He\npersuaded some of his friends who were due to be guillotined to\ncooperate in a series of tests. Each man was to keep blinking his\neyes as long as possible after his head left his body, as a sign that\nhe was still conscious. The doctor counted as high as six winks.\"\n\n\"Very interesting, I'm sure,\" Hawkes said guardedly. \"But a bit\nmorbid, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I was wondering,\" Johnson went on as though he had not heard the\nother, \"whether he was still conscious for that instant after you shot\nhim. And if that brought the look of surprise to his face.\"\n\n\n\nHawkes turned in his chair to face Johnson fully. \"You're driving at\nsomething,\" he said sharply. \"Get to the point.\"\n\n\"Personally I've wondered at a few things about you myself,\" Johnson\nsaid. He held the gun steadily in his hand now, no longer pretending\nto play with it. \"I told you that our second robbery occurred while I\nwas a clerk with the Company,\" he went on. \"They jerked me in to the\nHome Office, and for a while I had a pretty rough time.... You know,\nwhen I joined the Company, I was an amnesiac. I remembered my name,\nbut that's about all....\"\n\n\"No, I didn't know,\" Hawkes muttered, growing slightly paler.\n\n\"I learned then from the Home Office that I had been a member of their\nSecret Service some twenty years earlier. I'd been sent here to\ninvestigate the first robbery. And I had disappeared. Naturally, they\nhad suspected me.\n\n\"However, they had no evidence, and when I reappeared twenty years\nlater they played it smart by just waiting, instead of arresting me.\nWhen the second robbery occurred, they closed in.\n\n\"The only thing that saved me was the fact that tests proved my memory\nwas really gone, and that I had told the truth--as I knew it. From the\nfew scraps of information I retained--about being out on the Moebius\nStrip--they and I arrived at the theory I mentioned a short time ago.\nI was sent back here to wait. The Company never gives up. Remember?\"\n\n\"Are you insinuating that I was in cahoots with this fellow here?\"\nHawkes asked harshly.\n\n\"I'd say it was more than an insinuation,\" Johnson replied. \"You made\nseveral other slips. In the first place, Secret Service men are\nusually better informed about a situation they're investigating than\nyou seemed to be. Also, those identification papers you showed me were\nfaked.\"\n\n\n\nThe skin along the bridge of Hawkes' nose had drawn tight, and now his\nlips grew narrower. \"In that case, why did I save you from that man\nthis afternoon?\" he asked. \"And why would I shoot him now?\"\n\n\"Your saving me was an act, to get into my confidence. You shot him so\nyou wouldn't have to split the loot. I figure you were in with him on\nthe second robbery also. There had to be someone because his memory\nwould be gone, when he came off the Strip. But you weren't satisfied.\nTogether you decided to pull off another robbery while you were here\nand double the spoils. Then you decided you wanted it all for yourself\nand you shot him.\"\n\n\"There's one big flaw in your reasoning,\" Hawkes pointed out. \"How did\nI plan to get away? The only ships leaving here for several months\nbelong to the Company. Do you think I'd be foolish enough to expect\nthem to let me slip out on one of their ships?\"\n\n\"No. I think you intended to go out on the Strip yourself.\"\n\n\"All right then,\" Hawkes countered. \"You admitted that this was a\ntwo-man job. How could I protect myself when I returned, if I knew in\nadvance that I wouldn't know who I was, let alone what I had done?\"\n\n\"I'll come back to that in a minute,\" Johnson said. \"But now I'd\nadvise you to drop your gun on the floor and give yourself up. You've\ngot nothing to gain by carrying on the bluff. You know I'll never let\nyou get to the Strip. And, once I put you on the ship, the Company\nwill take over.\"\n\n\n\nHawkes' shoulders drooped. Finally he smiled raggedly. \"There's no use\nmy arguing any longer,\" he said. \"But you've made the mistake of\nunderestimating me, my friend. I've lost my gamble. That's all. You\nhave nothing on me. I'm not as ignorant of native law as I may have\npretended. Granted, I am carrying a lethal weapon. But I'm on private\nproperty. That's legal. I shot a man. But only in defense of my own\nlife. His gun on the floor will prove he came in armed. So I'm clean\nas far as the natives are concerned. Right?\"\n\nJohnson nodded.\n\n\"And, as for the Company, what will they hold me for? They can't prove\nany connection between me and him.\" Hawkes indicated the man on the\nfloor. \"And this robbery--it never actually came off. Earth laws don't\nallow prosecution for intent. Now, where does that leave you?\"\n\nJohnson stood up. \"You're right--as far as you went,\" he said. \"But,\nreturning to your earlier question about one man pulling this job, I\nasked myself how I would do it, if it had to be done alone. And I\nfound a way. You'd probably figure the same one. Now I'll take that\npaper in your pocket. It will serve very well as a confession.\"\n\nSuddenly Hawkes' right hand streaked toward a side pocket. Johnson\nleaned forward and brought the flat of his gun across the other's\ntemple.\n\nAs Hawkes sagged, Johnson ripped open his coat and took out a sealed\nenvelope. He removed a sheet of paper and read:\n\n     _This has been written for my own information. My name is\n     Alton Hawkes. I have robbed the Interplanets Company and\n     gone out on the Strip with the money. When I read this my\n     memory will be gone and twenty years will have elapsed._\n\n                                                     --CHARLES V. DE VET\n\n",
