    "body": "Frank Pembroke sat behind the desk of his shabby little office over\nLemark's Liquors in downtown Los Angeles and waited for his first\ncustomer. He had been in business for a week and as yet had had no\ncallers. Therefore, it was with a mingled sense of excitement and\nsatisfaction that he greeted the tall, dark, smooth-faced figure that\ncame up the stairs and into the office shortly before noon.\n\n\"Good day, sir,\" said Pembroke with an amiable smile. \"I see my\nadvertisement has interested you. Please stand in that corner for just a\nmoment.\"\n\nOpening the desk drawer, which was almost empty, Pembroke removed an\nautomatic pistol fitted with a silencer. Pointing it at the amazed\ncustomer, he fired four .22 caliber longs into the narrow chest. Then he\nmade a telephone call and sat down to wait. He wondered how long it\nwould be before his next client would arrive.\n\n\n\nThe series of events leading up to Pembroke's present occupation had\ncommenced on a dismal, overcast evening in the South Pacific a year\nearlier. Bound for Sydney, two days out of Valparaiso, the Colombian\ntramp steamer _Elena Mia_ had encountered a dense greenish fog which\nseemed vaguely redolent of citrus trees. Standing on the forward deck,\nPembroke was one of the first to perceive the peculiar odor and to spot\nthe immense gray hulk wallowing in the murky distance.\n\nThen the explosion had come, from far below the waterline, and the decks\nwere awash with frantic crewmen, officers, and the handful of\npassengers. Only two lifeboats were launched before the _Elena Mia_ went\ndown. Pembroke was in the second. The roar of the sinking ship was the\nlast thing he heard for some time.\n\nPembroke came as close to being a professional adventurer as one can in\nthese days of regimented travel, organized peril, and political\nrestriction. He had made for himself a substantial fortune through\nspeculation in a great variety of properties, real and otherwise. Life\nhad given him much and demanded little, which was perhaps the reason for\nhis restiveness.\n\n\n\nLoyalty to person or to people was a trait Pembroke had never recognized\nin himself, nor had it ever been expected of him. And yet he greatly\nenvied those staunch patriots and lovers who could find it in themselves\nto elevate the glory and safety of others above that of themselves.\n\nLacking such loyalties, Pembroke adapted quickly to the situation in\nwhich he found himself when he regained consciousness. He awoke in a\nsmall room in what appeared to be a typical modern American hotel. The\nwallet in his pocket contained exactly what it should, approximately\nthree hundred dollars. His next thought was of food. He left the room\nand descended via the elevator to the restaurant. Here he observed that\nit was early afternoon. Ordering a full dinner, for he was unusually\nhungry, he began to study the others in the restaurant.\n\nMany of the faces seemed familiar; the crew of the ship, probably. He\nalso recognized several of the passengers. However, he made no attempt\nto speak to them. After his meal, he bought a good corona and went for a\nwalk. His situation could have been any small western American seacoast\ncity. He heard the hiss of the ocean in the direction the afternoon sun\nwas taking. In his full-gaited walk, he was soon approaching the beach.\n\nOn the sand he saw a number of sun bathers. One in particular, an\nattractive woman of about thirty, tossed back her long, chestnut locks\nand gazed up intently at Pembroke as he passed. Seldom had he enjoyed so\ningenuous an invitation. He halted and stared down at her for a few\nmoments.\n\n\"You are looking for someone?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Much of the time,\" said the man.\n\n\"Could it be me?\"\n\n\"It could be.\"\n\n\"Yet you seem unsure,\" she said.\n\nPembroke smiled, uneasily. There was something not entirely normal about\nher conversation. Though the rest of her compensated for that.\n\n\"Tell me what's wrong with me,\" she went on urgently. \"I'm not good\nenough, am I? I mean, there's something wrong with the way I look or\nact. Isn't there? Please help me, please!\"\n\n\"You're not casual enough, for one thing,\" said Pembroke, deciding to\nplay along with her for the moment. \"You're too tense. Also you're a bit\nknock-kneed, not that it matters. Is that what you wanted to hear?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes--I mean, I suppose so. I can try to be more casual. But I\ndon't know what to do about my knees,\" she said wistfully, staring\nacross at the smooth, tan limbs. \"Do you think I'm okay otherwise? I\nmean, as a whole I'm not so bad, am I? Oh, please tell me.\"\n\n\"How about talking it over at supper tonight?\" Pembroke proposed. \"Maybe\nwith less distraction I'll have a better picture of you--as a whole.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's very generous of you,\" the woman told him. She scribbled a\nname and an address on a small piece of paper and handed it to him. \"Any\ntime after six,\" she said.\n\nPembroke left the beach and walked through several small specialty\nshops. He tried to get the woman off his mind, but the oddness of her\nconversation continued to bother him. She was right about being\ndifferent, but it was her concern about being different that made her\nso. How to explain _that_ to her?\n\n\n\nThen he saw the weird little glass statuette among the usual\nbric-a-brac. It rather resembled a ground hog, had seven fingers on each\nof its six limbs, and smiled up at him as he stared.\n\n\"Can I help you, sir?\" a middle-aged saleswoman inquired. \"Oh, good\nheavens, whatever is that thing doing here?\"\n\nPembroke watched with lifted eyebrows as the clerk whisked the bizarre\nstatuette underneath the counter.\n\n\"What the hell was that?\" Pembroke demanded.\n\n\"Oh, you know--or don't you? Oh, my,\" she concluded, \"are you one of\nthe--strangers?\"\n\n\"And if I were?\"\n\n\"Well, I'd certainly appreciate it if you'd tell me how I walk.\"\n\n\n\nShe came around in front of the counter and strutted back and forth a\nfew times.\n\n\"They tell me I lean too far forward,\" she confided. \"But I should think\nyou'd fall down if you didn't.\"\n\n\"Don't try to go so fast and you won't fall down,\" suggested Pembroke.\n\"You're in too much of a hurry. Also those fake flowers on your blouse\nmake you look frumpy.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm supposed to look frumpy,\" the woman retorted. \"That's the\ntype of person I am. But you can look frumpy and still walk natural,\ncan't you? Everyone says you can.\"\n\n\"Well, they've got a point,\" said Pembroke. \"Incidentally, just where\nare we, anyway? What city is this?\"\n\n\"Puerto Pacifico,\" she told him. \"Isn't that a lovely name? It means\npeaceful port. In Spanish.\"\n\nThat was fine. At least he now knew where he was. But as he left the\nshop he began checking off every west coast state, city, town, and\ninlet. None, to the best of his knowledge, was called Puerto Pacifico.\n\nHe headed for the nearest service station and asked for a map. The\nattendant gave him one which showed the city, but nothing beyond.\n\n\"Which way is it to San Francisco?\" asked Pembroke.\n\n\"That all depends on where you are,\" the boy returned.\n\n\"Okay, then where am I?\"\n\n\"Pardon me, there's a customer,\" the boy said. \"This is Puerto\nPacifico.\"\n\nPembroke watched him hurry off to service a car with a sense of having\nbeen given the runaround. To his surprise, the boy came back a few\nminutes later after servicing the automobile.\n\n\"Say, I've just figured out who you are,\" the youngster told him. \"I'd\nsure appreciate it if you'd give me a little help on my lingo. Also, you\ngas up the car first, then try to sell 'em the oil--right?\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Pembroke wearily. \"What's wrong with your lingo? Other\nthan the fact that it's not colloquial enough.\"\n\n\"Not enough slang, huh? Well, I guess I'll have to concentrate on that.\nHow about the smile?\"\n\n\"Perfect,\" Pembroke told him.\n\n\"Yeah?\" said the boy delightedly. \"Say, come back again, huh? I sure\nappreciate the help. Keep the map.\"\n\n\"Thanks. One more thing,\" Pembroke said. \"What's over that way--outside\nthe city?\"\n\n\"Sand.\"\n\n\"How about that way?\" he asked, pointing north. \"And that way?\" pointing\nsouth.\n\n\"More of the same.\"\n\n\"Any railroads?\"\n\n\"That we ain't got.\"\n\n\"Buses? Airlines?\"\n\nThe kid shook his head.\n\n\"Some city.\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's kinda isolated. A lot of ships dock here, though.\"\n\n\"All cargo ships, I'll bet. No passengers,\" said Pembroke.\n\n\"Right,\" said the attendant, giving with his perfect smile.\n\n\"No getting out of here, is there?\"\n\n\"That's for sure,\" the boy said, walking away to wait on another\ncustomer. \"If you don't like the place, you've had it.\"\n\n\n\nPembroke returned to the hotel. Going to the bar, he recognized one of\nthe _Elena Mia's_ paying passengers. He was a short, rectangular little\nman in his fifties named Spencer. He sat in a booth with three young\nwomen, all lovely, all effusive. The topic of the conversation turned\nout to be precisely what Pembroke had predicted.\n\n\"Well, Louisa, I'd say your only fault is the way you keep wigglin' your\nshoulders up 'n' down. Why'n'sha try holdin' 'em straight?\"\n\n\"I thought it made me look sexy,\" the redhead said petulantly.\n\n\"Just be yourself, gal,\" Spencer drawled, jabbing her intimately with a\nfat elbow, \"and you'll qualify.\"\n\n\"Me, me,\" the blonde with a feather cut was insisting. \"What is wrong\nwith me?\"\n\n\"You're perfect, sweetheart,\" he told her, taking her hand.\n\n\"Ah, come on,\" she pleaded. \"Everyone tells me I chew gum with my mouth\nopen. Don't you hate that?\"\n\n\"Naw, that's part of your charm,\" Spencer assured her.\n\n\"How 'bout me, sugar,\" asked the girl with the coal black hair.\n\n\"Ah, you're perfect, too. You are all perfect. I've never seen such a\ncollection of dolls as parade around this here city. C'mon, kids--how\n'bout another round?\"\n\nBut the dolls had apparently lost interest in him. They got up one by\none and walked out of the bar. Pembroke took his rum and tonic and moved\nover to Spencer's booth.\n\n\"Okay if I join you?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said the fat man. \"Wonder what the hell got into those babes?\"\n\n\"You said they were perfect. They know they're not. You've got to be\nrough with them in this town,\" said Pembroke. \"That's all they want from\nus.\"\n\n\"Mister, you've been doing some thinkin', I can see,\" said Spencer,\npeering at him suspiciously. \"Maybe you've figured out where we are.\"\n\n\"Your bet's as good as mine,\" said Pembroke. \"It's not Wellington, and\nit's not Brisbane, and it's not Long Beach, and it's not Tahiti. There\nare a lot of places it's not. But where the hell it is, you tell me.\n\n\"And, by the way,\" he added, \"I hope you like it in Puerto Pacifico.\nBecause there isn't any place to go from here and there isn't any way to\nget there if there were.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, gentlemen, but I'm Joe Valencia, manager of the hotel. I\nwould be very grateful if you would give me a few minutes of honest\ncriticism.\"\n\n\"Ah, no, not you, too,\" groaned Spencer. \"Look, Joe, what's the gag?\"\n\n\"You are newcomers, Mr. Spencer,\" Valencia explained. \"You are therefore\nin an excellent position to point out our faults as you see them.\"\n\n\"Well, so what?\" demanded Spencer. \"I've got more important things to do\nthan to worry about your troubles. You look okay to me.\"\n\n\"Mr. Valencia,\" said Pembroke. \"I've noticed that you walk with a very\nslight limp. If you have a bad leg, I should think you would do better\nto develop a more pronounced limp. Otherwise, you may appear to be\nself-conscious about it.\"\n\n\n\nSpencer opened his mouth to protest, but saw with amazement that it was\nexactly this that Valencia was seeking. Pembroke was amused at his\ncompanion's reaction but observed that Spencer still failed to see the\npoint.\n\n\"Also, there is a certain effeminateness in the way in which you speak,\"\nsaid Pembroke. \"Try to be a little more direct, a little more brusque.\nSpeak in a monotone. It will make you more acceptable.\"\n\n\"Thank you so much,\" said the manager. \"There is much food for thought\nin what you have said, Mr. Pembroke. However, Mr. Spencer, your value\nhas failed to prove itself. You have only yourself to blame. Cooperation\nis all we require of you.\"\n\nValencia left. Spencer ordered another martini. Neither he nor Pembroke\nspoke for several minutes.\n\n\"Somebody's crazy around here,\" the fat man muttered after a few\nmoments. \"Is it me, Frank?\"\n\n\"No. You just don't belong here, in this particular place,\" said\nPembroke thoughtfully. \"You're the wrong type. But they couldn't know\nthat ahead of time. The way they operate it's a pretty hit-or-miss\noperation. But they don't care one bit about us, Spencer. Consider the\nmen who went down with the ship. That was just part of the game.\"\n\n\"What the hell are you sayin'?\" asked Spencer in disbelief. \"You figure\n_they_ sunk the ship? Valencia and the waitress and the three babes? Ah,\ncome on.\"\n\n\"It's what you think that will determine what you do, Spencer. I suggest\nyou change your attitude; play along with them for a few days till the\npicture becomes a little clearer to you. We'll talk about it again\nthen.\"\n\nPembroke rose and started out of the bar. A policeman entered and walked\ndirectly to Spencer's table. Loitering at the juke box, Pembroke\noverheard the conversation.\n\n\"You Spencer?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said the fat man sullenly.\n\n\"What don't you like about me? The _truth_, buddy.\"\n\n\"Ah, hell! Nothin' wrong with you at all, and nothin'll make me say\nthere is,\" said Spencer.\n\n\"You're the guy, all right. Too bad, Mac,\" said the cop.\n\nPembroke heard the shots as he strolled casually out into the brightness\nof the hotel lobby. While he waited for the elevator, he saw them\ncarrying the body into the street. How many others, he wondered, had\ngone out on their backs during their first day in Puerto Pacifico?\n\n\n\nPembroke shaved, showered, and put on the new suit and shirt he had\nbought. Then he took Mary Ann, the woman he had met on the beach, out to\ndinner. She would look magnificent even when fully clothed, he decided,\nand the pale chartreuse gown she wore hardly placed her in that\ncategory. Her conversation seemed considerably more normal after the\nother denizens of Puerto Pacifico Pembroke had listened to that\nafternoon.\n\nAfter eating they danced for an hour, had a few more drinks, then went\nto Pembroke's room. He still knew nothing about her and had almost\nexhausted his critical capabilities, but not once had she become annoyed\nwith him. She seemed to devour every factual point of imperfection about\nherself that Pembroke brought to her attention. And, fantastically\nenough, she actually appeared to have overcome every little imperfection\nhe had been able to communicate to her.\n\nIt was in the privacy of his room that Pembroke became aware of just how\nperfect, physically, Mary Ann was. Too perfect. No freckles or moles\nanywhere on the visible surface of her brown skin, which was more than a\nmere sampling. Furthermore, her face and body were meticulously\nsymmetrical. And she seemed to be wholly ambidextrous.\n\n\"With so many beautiful women in Puerto Pacifico,\" said Pembroke\nprobingly, \"I find it hard to understand why there are so few children.\"\n\n\"Yes, children are decorative, aren't they,\" said Mary Ann. \"I do wish\nthere were more of them.\"\n\n\"Why not have a couple of your own?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, they're only given to maternal types. I'd never get one. Anyway, I\nwon't ever marry,\" she said. \"I'm the paramour type.\"\n\nIt was obvious that the liquor had been having some effect. Either that,\nor she had a basic flaw of loquacity that no one else had discovered.\nPembroke decided he would have to cover his tracks carefully.\n\n\"What type am I?\" he asked.\n\n\"Silly, you're real. You're not a type at all.\"\n\n\"Mary Ann, I love you very much,\" Pembroke murmured, gambling\neverything on this one throw. \"When you go to Earth I'll miss you\nterribly.\"\n\n\"Oh, but you'll be dead by then,\" she pouted. \"So I mustn't fall in love\nwith you. I don't want to be miserable.\"\n\n\"If I pretended I was one of you, if I left on the boat with you, they'd\nlet me go to Earth with you. Wouldn't they?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I'm sure they would.\"\n\n\"Mary Ann, you have two other flaws I feel I should mention.\"\n\n\"Yes? Please tell me.\"\n\n\"In the first place,\" said Pembroke, \"you should be willing to fall in\nlove with me even if it will eventually make you unhappy. How can you be\nthe paramour type if you refuse to fall in love foolishly? And when you\nhave fallen in love, you should be very loyal.\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" she said unsurely. \"What else?\"\n\n\"The other thing is that, as my mistress, you must never mention me to\nanyone. It would place me in great danger.\"\n\n\"I'll never tell anyone anything about you,\" she promised.\n\n\"Now try to love me,\" Pembroke said, drawing her into his arms and\nkissing with little pleasure the smooth, warm perfection of her tanned\ncheeks. \"Love me my sweet, beautiful, affectionate Mary Ann. My\nparamour.\"\n\nMaking love to Mary Ann was something short of ecstasy. Not for any\nobvious reason, but because of subtle little factors that make a woman a\nwoman. Mary Ann had no pulse. Mary Ann did not perspire. Mary Ann did\nnot fatigue gradually but all at once. Mary Ann breathed regularly under\nall circumstances. Mary Ann talked and talked and talked. But then, Mary\nAnn was not a human being.\n\nWhen she left the hotel at midnight, Pembroke was quite sure that she\nunderstood his plan and that she was irrevocably in love with him.\nTomorrow might bring his death, but it might also ensure his escape.\nAfter forty-two years of searching for a passion, for a cause, for a\nloyalty, Frank Pembroke had at last found his. Earth and the human race\nthat peopled it. And Mary Ann would help him to save it.\n\n\n\nThe next morning Pembroke talked to Valencia about hunting. He said that\nhe planned to go shooting out on the desert which surrounded the city.\nValencia told him that there were no living creatures anywhere but in\nthe city. Pembroke said he was going out anyway.\n\nHe picked up Mary Ann at her apartment and together they went to a\nsporting goods store. As he guessed there was a goodly selection of\nfirearms, despite the fact that there was nothing to hunt and only a\nsingle target range within the city. Everything, of course, had to be\njust like Earth. That, after all, was the purpose of Puerto Pacifico.\n\nBy noon they had rented a jeep and were well away from the city.\nPembroke and Mary Ann took turns firing at the paper targets they had\npurchased. At twilight they headed back to the city. On the outskirts,\nwhere the sand and soil were mixed and no footprints would be left,\nPembroke hopped off. Mary Ann would go straight to the police and report\nthat Pembroke had attacked her and that she had shot him. If necessary,\nshe would conduct the authorities to the place where they had been\ntarget shooting, but would be unable to locate the spot where she had\nburied the body. Why had she buried it? Because at first she was not\ngoing to report the incident. She was frightened. It was not airtight,\nbut there would probably be no further investigation. And they certainly\nwould not prosecute Mary Ann for killing an Earthman.\n\nNow Pembroke had himself to worry about. The first step was to enter\nsmoothly into the new life he had planned. It wouldn't be so comfortable\nas the previous one, but should be considerably safer. He headed slowly\nfor the \"old\" part of town, aging his clothes against buildings and\nfences as he walked. He had already torn the collar of the shirt and\ndiscarded his belt. By morning his beard would grow to blacken his face.\nAnd he would look weary and hungry and aimless. Only the last would be a\ndeception.\n\n\n\nTwo weeks later Pembroke phoned Mary Ann. The police had accepted her\nstory without even checking. And when, when would she be seeing him\nagain? He had aroused her passion and no amount of long-distance love\ncould requite it. Soon, he assured her, soon.\n\n\"Because, after all, you do owe me something,\" she added.\n\nAnd that was bad because it sounded as if she had been giving some\nwomanly thought to the situation. A little more of that and she might go\nto the police again, this time for vengeance.\n\nTwice during his wanderings Pembroke had seen the corpses of Earthmen\nbeing carted out of buildings. They had to be Earthmen because they\nbled. Mary Ann had admitted that she did not. There would be very few\nEarthmen left in Puerto Pacifico, and it would be simple enough to\nlocate him if he were reported as being on the loose. There was no out\nbut to do away with Mary Ann.\n\nPembroke headed for the beach. He knew she invariably went there in the\nafternoon. He loitered around the stalls where hot dogs and soft drinks\nwere sold, leaning against a post in the hot sun, hat pulled down over\nhis forehead. Then he noticed that people all about him were talking\nexcitedly. They were discussing a ship. It was leaving that afternoon.\nAnyone who could pass the interview would be sent to Earth.\n\nPembroke had visited the docks every day, without being able to learn\nwhen the great exodus would take place. Yet he was certain the first\nlap would be by water rather than by spaceship, since no one he had\ntalked to in the city had ever heard of spaceships. In fact, they knew\nvery little about their masters.\n\nNow the ship had arrived and was to leave shortly. If there was any but\nthe most superficial examination, Pembroke would no doubt be discovered\nand exterminated. But since no one seemed concerned about anything but\nhis own speech and behavior, he assumed that they had all qualified in\nevery other respect. The reason for transporting Earth People to this\nplanet was, of course, to apply a corrective to any of the Pacificos'\naberrant mannerisms or articulation. This was the polishing up phase.\n\n\n\nPembroke began hobbling toward the docks. Almost at once he found\nhimself face to face with Mary Ann. She smiled happily when she\nrecognized him. _That_ was a good thing.\n\n\"It is a sign of poor breeding to smile at tramps,\" Pembroke admonished\nher in a whisper. \"Walk on ahead.\"\n\nShe obeyed. He followed. The crowd grew thicker. They neared the docks\nand Pembroke saw that there were now set up on the roped-off wharves\nsmall interviewing booths. When it was their turn, he and Mary Ann each\nwent into separate ones. Pembroke found himself alone in the little\nroom.\n\nThen he saw that there was another entity in his presence confined\nbeneath a glass dome. It looked rather like a groundhog and had seven\nfingers on each of its six limbs. But it was larger and hairier than the\nglass one he had seen at the gift store. With four of its limbs it\ntapped on an intricate keyboard in front of it.\n\n\"What is your name?\" queried a metallic voice from a speaker on the\nwall.\n\n\"I'm Jerry Newton. Got no middle initial,\" Pembroke said in a surly\nvoice.\n\n\"Occupation?\"\n\n\"I work a lot o' trades. Fisherman, fruit picker, fightin' range fires,\nvineyards, car washer. Anything. You name it. Been out of work for a\nlong time now, though. Goin' on five months. These here are hard times,\nno matter what they say.\"\n\n\"What do you think of the Chinese situation?\" the voice inquired.\n\n\"Which situation's 'at?\"\n\n\"Where's Seattle?\"\n\n\"Seattle? State o' Washington.\"\n\nAnd so it went for about five minutes. Then he was told he had qualified\nas a satisfactory surrogate for a mid-twentieth century American male,\nitinerant type.\n\n\"You understand your mission, Newton?\" the voice asked. \"You are to\nestablish yourself on Earth. In time you will receive instructions. Then\nyou will attack. You will not see us, your masters, again until the\natmosphere has been sufficiently chlorinated. In the meantime, serve us\nwell.\"\n\nHe stumbled out toward the docks, then looked about for Mary Ann. He saw\nher at last behind the ropes, her lovely face in tears.\n\nThen she saw him. Waving frantically, she called his name several times.\nPembroke mingled with the crowd moving toward the ship, ignoring her.\nBut still the woman persisted in her shouting.\n\nSidling up to a well-dressed man-about-town type, Pembroke winked at him\nand snickered.\n\n\"You Frank?\" he asked.\n\n\"Hell, no. But some poor punk's sure red in the face, I'll bet,\" the\nman-about-town said with a chuckle. \"Those high-strung paramour types\nalways raising a ruckus. They never do pass the interview. Don't know\nwhy they even make 'em.\"\n\nSuddenly Mary Ann was quiet.\n\n\"Ambulance squad,\" Pembroke's companion explained. \"They'll take her off\nto the buggy house for a few days and bring her out fresh and ignorant\nas the day she was assembled. Don't know why they keep making 'em, as I\nsay. But I guess there's a call for that type up there on Earth.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I reckon there is at that,\" said Pembroke, snickering again as he\nmoved away from the other. \"And why not? Hey? Why not?\"\n\nPembroke went right on hating himself, however, till the night he was\ndeposited in a field outside of Ensenada, broke but happy, with two\nother itinerant types. They separated in San Diego, and it was not long\nbefore Pembroke was explaining to the police how he had drifted far from\nthe scene of the sinking of the _Elena Mia_ on a piece of wreckage, and\nhad been picked up by a Chilean trawler. How he had then made his way,\nwith much suffering, up the coast to California. Two days later, his\nidentity established and his circumstances again solvent, he was headed\nfor Los Angeles to begin his save-Earth campaign.\n\n\n\nNow, seated at his battered desk in the shabby rented office over\nLemark's Liquors, Pembroke gazed without emotion at the two demolished\nPacificos that lay sprawled one atop the other in the corner. His watch\nsaid one-fifteen. The man from the FBI should arrive soon.\n\nThere were footsteps on the stairs for the third time that day. Not the\nbrisk, efficient steps of a federal official, but the hesitant,\nself-conscious steps of a junior clerk type.\n\nPembroke rose as the young man appeared at the door. His face was\nsmooth, unpimpled, clean-shaven, without sweat on a warm summer\nafternoon.\n\n\"Are you Dr. Von Schubert?\" the newcomer asked, peering into the room.\n\"You see, I've got a problem--\"\n\nThe four shots from Pembroke's pistol solved his problem effectively.\nPembroke tossed his third victim onto the pile, then opened a can of\nlager, quaffing it appreciatively. Seating himself once more, he leaned\nback in the chair, both feet upon the desk.\n\nHe would be out of business soon, once the FBI agent had got there.\nPembroke was only in it to get the proof he would need to convince\npeople of the truth of his tale. But in the meantime he allowed himself\nto admire the clipping of the newspaper ad he had run in all the Los\nAngeles papers for the past week. The little ad that had saved mankind\nfrom God-knew-what insidious menace. It read:\n\n          ARE YOU IMPERFECT?\n\n    LET DR. VON SCHUBERT POINT OUT\n              YOUR FLAWS\n\n    IT IS HIS GOAL TO MAKE YOU THE\n        AVERAGE FOR YOUR TYPE\n\n              FEE--$3.75\n\n     MONEY BACK IF NOT SATISFIED!\n\n\nTHE END\n\n",
