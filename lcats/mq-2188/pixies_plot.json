Thus welcomed, they might\nbe trusted to show their human hosts goodwill, friendship, and\nservice._)\n\n    You have it, or you have it not:\n    The cantle of the Pixies\u2019 plot,\n    Where never spade nor hoe shall ply\n    To break that treasured sanctity.\n    Touch no bloom there; uproot no weed;\n    Let what will blow.\n    Suffer the thistle, briar and thorn to grow,\n    The dandelion to seed.\n\n    Though full the garden of your mind,\n    Well planted on a soil that\u2019s kind;\n    Your hedges gay, your borders clean,\n    Your seasons fair, your clime serene,\n    Yet trammel not the Pixies\u2019 mite,\n    For well-coming\n    Chance little, wandering, weary, fairy thing\n    Lost in the dim owl-light.\n\n    Still virgin, free and set apart,\n    Ordain one dingle of your heart,\n    Where visions home and wing to you\n    The golden dreams that might come true.\n    Herein a gentler dawn than day\n    Shall often break\n    For foot-sore spirits, tired of reason\u2019s ache,\n    And children come to play.\n\n\n\n\n*THE CHARM*\n\n\n    When chafers drone their litany\n    And pray, \"Oh, Father, grant that we\n    From airy-mouse delivered be,\"\n    Go seek the charm.\n\n    Under the sky, when a star shoots,\n    Beneath an oak, when the owl hoots,\n    Gather ye simples, dig ye roots\n    For the rare charm.\n\n    That glassy ghost upon a thorn--\n    The raiment of a snake outworn--\n    Must backward through the dark be borne\n    To feed the charm.\n\n    A glow-worm--she whose gentle light\n    Glimmers green-gold through a blue night\n    Beside the churchyard aconite--\n    Shall help the charm.\n\n    One willow from the cradle take\n    Where a boy baby lies awake,\n    And splinters off a coffin break\n    To build the charm.\n\n    A tarnished silver chalice bring,\n    Dead gossips gave at christening,\n    And dip the moonlight from a spring\n    To crown the charm.\n\n    This much, God wot, a child might do,\n    Yet all must fail if haply you\n    Lack a child\u2019s faith, so trusting, true,\n    To bless the charm.\n\n    Many the spells of high degree\n    And fruitful happiness I see\n    All lost, for faith to set them free\n    And work the charm.\n\n\n\n\n*JOE\u2019S DONKEY*\n\n\n    The harp of night had silver strings,\n    The moon was low, the stars burned dim,\n    When from a wood, with roaring wings,\n    Joe flushed a brace of cherubim.\n\n    His eye did bulge at sign so brave\n    To see the shining angels pass;\n    Then, happening beside her grave,\n    He met his dead and buried ass!\n\n    She\u2019d broke a leg and so was slain\n    And buried here a week ago;\n    Now, all alive and sound again,\n    She brayed with joy to welcome Joe!\n\n    A holy cross that donkeys bear,\n    Since Jesus Christ did deign to ride,\n    The cherubs tempted to repair\n    That ancient beast in bone and hide.\n\n    The harp of morn had golden strings\n    Ere home they came--Joe\u2019s ass and he;\n    And when their neighbours heard these things\n    They praised the Lord right heartily.\n\n\n\n\n*DIANA*\n\n\n    Look not upon a moon that\u2019s new,\n    For with her bitter sickle keen\n    She comes between, she comes between,\n    And cuts the tender from the true.\n\n    Look not upon a white full moon:\n    Her stiff-starched pudency doth shame\n    The throbbing pulse, the leaping flame,\n    And freezes passion at its noon.\n\n    Look not upon a moon that\u2019s old\n    With fallen breast and shadowy eyes,\n    Till the last hope of loving dies,\n    And heart\u2019s outworn and blood run cold.\n\n\n\n\n*THE MOUSE AND THE EPITAPH*\n\n\n    In moonlight grey the hungry church-yard mouse\n    Sat on old William Blee--his narrow house.\n    Climbing the mound, an ancient slate he read,\n    Then spoke, with rustic frankness, to the dead.\n    \"\u2019A husband and a father dear\u2019: What then?\n    So much is true of mice as well as men.\n    \u2019Friend to the poor\u2019?  That\u2019s humbug, Billy Blee!\n    When did you ever spare a crumb for me?\"\n\n\n\n\n*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*\n\n\n    Through the green dell she went,\n    Bright haired, with cheeks that burned;\n    Her passion hardly pent;\n    Her eyes upon him turned.\n    Her crocus-coloured gown\n    Over her white, young breast beat up and down.\n\n    Adream, he did not guess,\n    But dwelt upon his thought\n    Of perfect loveliness,\n    Nor heeded when she caught\n    A sigh his bosom breathed,\n    And murmured it again with music wreathed.\n\n    Oh, wasted wealth of love;\n    While Echo\u2019s heart will break,\n    Narcissus from above,\n    Within a glassy lake,\n    Beholds perfection lie\n    And, for the vision of himself, must die.\n\n    Now, hid in bare-ribbed rock\n    With crocus-coloured veins,\n    She guards from windy shock,\n    She shields from wild March rains,\n    Where grass and granite meet,\n    The daffodil that\u2019s budding at her feet.\n\n\n\n\n*THE SANDHILLS*\n\n\n    Oh, naked-footed boy, with the wild hair\n    And laughing eyes, is it so long ago\n    Among these windy dunes you made your lair,\n    Beside the immutable sea\u2019s unwearied ebb and flow?\n\n    Above you sings the horrent bent; the sun\n    Finds you and burns your budding limbs to brown;\n    You race the waves and wade and leap and run,\n    Then in the sweet, hot sand, contented, cuddle down\n\n    You dream great dreams, while all the upper air\n    Is musical with mews; and round about,\n    Upon the flats among the sea-ways there,\n    The dim sea-lavender spreads her purple fingers out.\n\n    And still the sandhills roll and still the sea\n    Flings a straight line of everlasting blue\n    Athwart their shining hillocks; solemnly\n    The ships go by, but not the wondrous ships you knew.\n\n    When first your path among the sand dunes fell--\n    The dunes that stretched as now and shone of yore\n    In their bright nakedness--a magic spell\n    Of mystery they wove along the shining shore.\n\n    This poppy with the horn, this bindweed white\n    And salicornia in its crimson bands\n    Meant more, far more than beauty and delight:\n    They stood for treasure torn from drowning pirates\u2019 hands.\n\n    These amber weeds were then a garment brave;\n    These agate stones were gems of splendid size\n    Once decked a mermaid in a deep sea cave,\n    Lit by gigantic fish from their green, glimmering eyes.\n\n    The sandhills were your giants, cruel or kind;\n    Each falling billow told another tale;\n    Fairies and goblins flew upon the wind;\n    There lurked a tragedy in every sea-bird\u2019s wail.\n\n    And now the watchful sea doth bid me say;\n    The salt air whispers me to speak and tell\n    Where is that little boy from yesterday\n    Whom wind and wave and sand and sunshine knew so well?\n\n    \"He was our playmate; us he understood\n    And ran to us with glory in his eyes;\n    We loved him and we wrought to work his good;\n    We made him strong and brave and with our wisdom wise.\n\n    \"Will he not come again?  The flowerets small\n    Have opened for his eager hands once more;\n    Among the yellow whins the linnets call,\n    The wrack and shells he sought still drift along the shore.\n\n    \"He climbed the crests of all our ridges grey\n    And sang to us and paddled where our foam\n    Thins to a crystal film.  But yesterday\n    A happy sprite was he; where now does our boy roam?\n\n    \"Deep of the many voices, on whose face\n    No seal is set through all the centuries fled,\n    Laugh on at time, nor know the hurricane race\n    Of his few, hurtling years above a human head.\n\n    \"And thou, old dune; the stars of heaven shall rove,\n    The galaxies break up to wheel about\n    And in new, glittering constellations move\n    Before thine hour-glass grey hath run its measure out.\n\n    \"Your yesterday, you immemorial things,\n    Whereon the ages yet no shadow cast,\n    For me the hurrying and sleepless wings\n    Of year on stormy year have swept into the past.\n\n    \"Yet think not I have lost that faith and joy\n    Felt when my world was young and I a part.\n    Oh, sea and sand and wild, west wind, your boy\n    Lies hidden safe within my steadfast, changeless heart.\"\n\n\n\n\n*THE GHOST*\n\n\n    Night-foundered to the ruin he came\n    Nor recked of its uncanny fame;\n    A haunt of slumber opened here,\n    And weariness, that casts out fear,\n    His footsteps led.\n    The moon swam low; the woods were still;\n    Dog foxes barked upon the hill;\n    With zig-zag wing a flitter-mouse\n    Flew in and out the haunted house\n    And overhead.\n\n    Within, decaying wood and lime\n    Lifted their incense up to time;\n    The foot fell hollow; echoes woke,\n    And whispering, half-heard voices spoke\n    Behind the dark.\n    Aloft, the drowsy wanderer found\n    A chamber far above the ground;\n    Whose casement, rusty-ironed and high,\n    Gaped ivy-clad upon the sky,\n    Starlit and stark.\n\n    White-fingered now the moonbeams ran\n    To ripple on the resting man.\n    He saw their stealthy silver creep\n    As it would drown him in his sleep\n    With splendour mild.\n    And then a subtle shadow moved,\n    A spirit that the dead had loved:\n    For wanly limned against the gloom\n    Of that forbid, forgotten room\n    There ran a child.\n\n    She twinkled in her candid shift,\n    Light as a moth, so silent, swift,\n    And peeped and peered for what might be\n    Hid in that ancient nursery--\n    A babe of joy.\n    But something called the busy wight:\n    She faded sudden from his sight;\n    And, as her little glimmer paled\n    Like a glass bell, the ghostling wailed,\n    \"Where is my toy?\"\n\n\n\n\n*A TEST*\n\n\n    _He_\n\n    \"I\u2019ll bring bright rainbow gold--\n    The rainbow too, a gown for you\n    In glorious fold on fold.\n\n    \"A necklace of white stars\n    About your throat shall hang and gloat;\n    And, for an ear-ring, Mars.\n\n    \"Unto the ends of earth,\n    Oh, dearest Heart, will I depart\n    To glean their utmost worth.\n\n    \"Until, with great amaze\n    At all I do, my Soul, for you,\n    The good round world shall gaze!\"\n\n\n    _She_\n\n    \"But these are gifts of dust,\n    Unfit to prove a hero\u2019s love\n    Or win a maiden\u2019s trust.\n\n    \"To love\u2019s supreme degree\n    If you would come, then bide at home\n    And never tire of me.\"\n\n\n\n\n*DREAMS*\n\n\n    When I have won to rest once more\n    In sanctity of night and sleep,\n    Drift visions from the shadow shore--\n    Small, patient forms that creep.\n    They move in drab; they wear no wings;\n    They are the dreams that might come true--\n    Meek phantoms of the modest things\n    That I have power to do.\n\n    Like azure shadows in the snow,\n    Or bloom upon the sun-kissed grape,\n    Sweep lovelier shapes, that gleam and glow\n    And don a rarer shape.\n    They smile with eyes of queens and kings;\n    They call on me to make them true--\n    The lordly, gracious, sovereign things\n    I have no power to do.\n\n    Remain such waking dreams as limn\n    Upon reality and truth,\n    Flying like holy seraphim\n    Whose rainbow wings drop ruth.\n    Born of the human sorrowings\n    That pierce our common nature through,\n    They challenge to the mightiest things\n    All men have power to do.\n\n\n\n\n*THE FIRE-DRAKE*\n\n\n    An\u2019 it should be you\u2019d make,\n    All for your sweetheart\u2019s joy,\n    A jewelly fire-drake,\n    This goes unto the toy:\n    A dragon-fly that\u2019s blue,\n    With little glow-worms two,\n    And morning drops of dew\n    Upon a spider\u2019s thread.\n\n    All these are simple things\n    And easy to be got,\n    But now the fire-drake\u2019s wings\n    Will puzzle you, God wot.\n    The flash that in them lies\n    Shall come not from the skies,\n    But lights the diamond eyes\n    In your dear sweetheart\u2019s head.\n\n    Lacking that pearly gleam,\n    So magical to see,\n    Your gift is but a dream:\n    The fire-drake cannot be.\n    But if the maiden pout\n    And anger peepeth out,\n    Ere she your heart would flout\n    Fly to the priest and wed.\n\n    Better to love she turn\n    At her fond lover\u2019s side\n    Than for the fire-drake burn\n    And ever be denied.\n    Go husband and go wife,\n    Without one thought of strife,\n    In blessing of shared life\n    The marriage way to tread.\n\n\n\n\n*THE SEVEN MAIDENS*\n\n\n    In far away and olden times\n    Sped from their hamlet seven maids\n    To dim and moonlit heather glades,\n    Upon the hour of midnight chimes.\n    One passion drew them secretly;\n    One master joy their little feet\n    Called to that desolate retreat,\n    Where never mortal man might see.\n    \u2019Twas blue-eyed Dian who led the dance,\n    With Linnette, Bethkin, Jennifer,\n    Avisa, Petronell and Nance.\n\n    Unknown they kept their nightly cheer;\n    Unguessed beneath the moon they kept\n    Brave frolic, while the village slept,\n    Nor dreamed the danger drawing near;\n    For on a holy Sabbath even,\n    When pirouette had been a shame,\n    Walking sedate, strange music came\n    To tempt the toes of all the seven--\n    Of blue-eyed Dian, who led the dance,\n    Of Linnette, Bethkin, Jennifer,\n    Avisa, Petronell and Nance.\n\n    The demon Piper tuned his reed\n    To madden each light-footed maid.\n    They listened, wondering, unafraid,\n    Nor thought upon the sorry speed\n    Awaiting any wanton one\n    Who\u2019d sport upon the Lord\u2019s own Day;\n    Then, tripping through that dimpsy grey,\n    Quick fingers joined--the deed was done!\n    For blue-eyed Dian had dared to dance\n    With Linnette, Bethkin, Jennifer,\n    Avisa, Petronell and Nance.\n\n    Their eyes like emeralds through the gloom,\n    Leapt elves and fairies, gnomes and imps,\n    In fearful haste to win a glimpse\n    Of the unhappy maidens\u2019 doom;\n    For sudden rang a thunder-shock\n    And flashed blue lightning-fork, to show\n    Beneath its grim and baleful glow,\n    Each flying girl turned to a rock!\n    Alas for Dian, who led the dance,\n    For Linnette, Bethkin, Jennifer,\n    Avisa, Petronell and Nance.\n\n    And now, at every Hunter\u2019s moon,\n    That haggard cirque of stones so still\n    Awakens to immortal thrill,\n    And seven small maids in silver shoon,\n    \u2019Twixt dark of night and white of day,\n    Twinkle upon the sere, old heath,\n    Like living blossoms in a wreath,\n    Then shrink again to granite grey.\n    So blue-eyed Dian shall ever dance\n    With Linnette, Bethkin, Jennifer,\n    Avisa, Petronell and Nance.\n\n\n\n\n*THE HERON*\n\n\n    Where leaps the burn by granite stairs\n    Into an eddying pool, he stood,\n    Personifying solitude\n    And meditating his affairs.\n\n    A bird august beyond belief\n    Distinguished in his way of thought,\n    Yet the sworn enemy of sport--\n    A \"poacher,\" \"vagabond,\" and \"thief.\"\n\n    Creation\u2019s lord, the heron knew,\n    Denied his right to fish for trout--\n    A fact that often made him doubt\n    Of justice on a general view.\n\n    Then me he saw, and, guessing not\n    I held him innocent to be,\n    He spread slow pinions heavily\n    And drifted to a lonelier spot;\n\n    But left a feather by the stream,\n    Deep in the plume, fair, silver grey,\n    With which I\u2019ll write upon the day:\n    \"Live and let live\" shall be my theme.\n\n\n\n\n*THE GRIEF*\n\n\n    A grief came unto me at noon of night\n    Blown on a breath of silky, southern air\n    With scent of myrtles and a crown of light\n    For aureole: vanished loveliness was there\n    And old, lost, magical things, all gracious and all rare.\n\n    Wings of cloud-purple from the Inland Sea,\n    Foam-tipped, my Grief outspread; the southern sun\n    Burned for a diadem, and mystery,\n    From the dim smoke of olive orchards won,\n    Arrayed that delicate shape in silver they had spun.\n\n    How little, little \u2019twixt our joy and woe!\n    Not sorrow then, but glad epiphanies\n    Of treasured happiness from long ago,\n    Had been my dreaming; but in bitter wise\n    The Grief looked on my face with a dead woman\u2019s eyes.\n\n\n\n\n*ON THE EBB*\n\n\n    The tide fell fast and foaming, the empty sand shone bright,\n    And by the ocean roaming, upon the edge of night,\n    I found a something stranded with sea-fowl mewing high--\n    A wondrous atom landed and left all high and dry.\n\n    Whoever yet suspected mer-babies on a beach?\n    Yet here, by tide neglected, lay one within my reach--\n    A dainty, winsome creature as pink as any rose,\n    His golden tail a feature to take the place of toes.\n\n    And through the billows splashing, the sunset in her hair,\n    Over the white foam flashing, there rode a lady fair.\n    His blue-eyed, wild mer-mother swam wailing on the sea.\n    She sparkled through the smother and clamoured mournfully.\n\n    In gentle hands and steady, I lifted her delight,\n    Made sure that she was ready, then flung with all my might.\n    She sprang, like salmon leaping; she laughed in radiant\n    And gathered to safe keeping her rosy, golden boy.\n\n    I\u2019d earned a mother\u2019s blessing--a good thing any day;\n    But now one fell to guessing what Science had to say:\n    For such authentic wonders, upon an ebbing tide,\n    Show zoologic blunders that cannot be denied.\n\n\n\n\n*SCANDAL*\n\n\n    An owl alighted in the yew\n    Beside a poet\u2019s little house;\n    The hour was nearly half-past two,\n    And, as he ate his juicy mouse,\n    A cuckoo clock made cheerful chime\n    Within and shouted out the time.\n\n    \"O gracious God!\" the owl began,\n    And rolled his round eyes at the moon,\n    \"What a black piece of work is man--\n    Well might we miss cuckoo in June.\n    How mad, misguided, inhumane\n    To keep cuckoo upon a chain!\n\n    \"But all the feathered folk must know;\n    This infamy I\u2019ll bring to light,\n    And hoot the horror high and low\n    And scream the crime by day and night.\n    No bird shall sing to him again\n    Who keeps a cuckoo on a chain.\"\n\n\n\n\n*TO A BAT*\n\n\n    The sickle moon is in the west\n    And where, against the fading green,\n    A thicket darkles shall be seen\n    The humming chafers on their quest.\n    Come, leather-bird, rise up and gird!\n\n    Round sunset eaves there boom again\n    Great beetles on their sharded wings\n    And many air-borne lesser things\n    Are tapping at the window pane.\n    Come, flitter-mouse, and haunt my house.\n\n    But where the stygian water broods,\n    Dim twilight homes for evermore,\n    And bats beat up the dusky shore\n    For white, ghost-moths in phantom woods.\n    Come, pipistrelle, be off to hell.\n\n\n\n\n*MOON-MOTH*\n\n\n    Beyond the sun, beside a crystal sea\n    She ruled her isle of lapis lazuli.\n    Her palaces of marble, agate, jade\n    Rose like a sheaf of savage flowers and laid\n    A splendour on the waves that only night could fade.\n\n    And for her nameless sins and cruelties,\n    Murders of love-mad men and lusts and lies,\n    Her sentence fell and she was swept away\n    From flaming pomps and crimes and royal sway,\n    Hurled from the joy of life, rapt from the light of day.\n\n    Yet, being fairest far and loveliest\n    Of any in a woman\u2019s body drest,\n    Fate banished not her beauty from the earth--\n    Only her evil happiness and mirth,\n    And left her living dead, doomed to eternal dearth.\n\n    The Shadows that do mould our destiny\n    Willed her a moon-moth evermore to be--\n    Woman and insect one in mingled state,\n    A chimera without a peer, or mate,\n    To ancient Night inscribed and Darkness dedicate.\n\n    By day she sleeps, even as the vampires sleep,\n    Behind her sombre wings, that fold and keep\n    Her body\u2019s glory hidden: they are brown,\n    Grizzled and amber, jagged and slashed adown\n    With faded serecloth grey--a winding-sheet for gown.\n\n    And while she hides within some tawny brake\n    Her shard but echoes the dead leaf and snake,\n    Where, tranced in slumber, through the long day\u2019s prime\n    Her motley coverings harmonious chime\n    With sad, crepuscular shades in dusky, twilight rhyme.\n\n    Invisible thus; but when returning night\n    Drowns with a purple torrent all the light,\n    She rises woman high and spreads her wing,\n    A rare, unparagoned, unearthly thing\n    Beyond the dream of joy or grief\u2019s imagining.\n\n    Upon her head two radiant feathery rays\n    Of crocus fire flash upward; but the gaze\n    From her dim, poisonous, and anguished eyes\n    Throbs out with passionate, violet miseries,\n    In hate that never fades and woe that never dies.\n\n    Her body, like the heart of a white rose,\n    Shines in the petals of her wings and glows;\n    Her pinions--azure, lilac, marigold--\n    Wide on the dark deliciously unfold\n    As any rainbow bright, as any glacier cold.\n\n    Lit with her own and inner gleam, she shines\n    Like a low meteor through the lians and vines,\n    Flies upward high beyond the forest towers,\n    Then swoops and hawks along night-hidden bowers,\n    To hang on murmuring plumes and drink the livid flowers.\n\n    Most fair, most foul, at Moira\u2019s stern decree\n    The radiant monster wanders wretchedly\n    Haunting each strand and isle of that lone shore\n    Where never human eye may see her more,\n    Or sentient soul delight and tremble and adore.\n\n    Yet deep in dreams I often faintly hear,\n    Like a sad wind that strokes my sleeping ear,\n    By fairy waters of that far lagoon,\n    The moon-moth wailing, wailing to the moon\n    Through many a silver night at hour of plenilune.\n\n\n\n\n*THE HUNTING*\n\n\n    When red sun fox steals down the sky,\n    And darkness dims the heavens high,\n    There leap again upon his tracks\n    The eager, starry, hunting packs.\n      They glitter, glitter, gold and green,\n      With sparks of frosty fire between,\n      And Dian bright as day;\n      While in the gloaming, far below,\n      Brown owl doth shout \"Hi!  Tally Ho!\n      Sun fox hath gone away!\"\n\n    To music of the spheres they sweep\n    Over the western world asleep;\n    Then in the east, with sudden rush,\n      Sun fox shall whisk his white-tipped brush.\n      The field is fading, gold and green,\n      With sparks of frosty fire between,\n      And Dian growing grey;\n      While morning leaps the hither hill\n      And herald lark shouts with a will,\n      \"Sun fox hath gone away!\"\n\n    Oh, Huntress fond and silly stars--\n    White Venus, fiery, futile Mars,\n    In vain your pack ye whirl and cast\n    Upon the marches of the vast;\n      In vain ye glitter, gold and green,\n      With sparks of frosty fire between,\n      And Dian\u2019s arrows fly\n      In silver shafts of broken light;\n      For ne\u2019er shall day be caught by night,\n      And sun fox cannot die.\n\n\n\n\n*THE GOOD GIRL*\n\n\n    When you were born, a shooting star did sunder\n    The nightly void, and flashed to earth and brought\n    Endowment of rare magic and sweet wonder\n    And gifts beyond your mother\u2019s highest thought.\n\n    Oh, blessed be your soul of cheerfulness,\n    Your mind content and steadfast set, to hold\n    Such level journeying through storm and stress\n    Of life\u2019s rough weather and hope\u2019s heat and cold.\n\n    You come, a restful breath of evening wind\n    Upon the parched day, and cannot see\n    Your winning humour hearten many a mind\n    Where you bestow yourself unconsciously.\n\n    Never the violet her own fragrance knew:\n    Even such a flowery innocent are you.\n\n\n\n\n*THE LOVER*\n\n\n    Under the silver thatch, where dwells my love,\n    About her dormer window, in the straw,\n    The sparrows build, and with their morning talk\n    Often awaken her.\n\n    And by the lattice climbs a crimson rose,\n    Who, if he could but see my dinky dear,\n    Before her loveliness, so wonderful,\n    Would pale with jealousy.\n\n    When the first glow of honeysuckle dawn\n    Cuddles her cottage in the dayspring light,\n    I pass upon my woodland road to work\n    And whistle as I come.\n\n    And if she hear me and twinkle out of bed\n    To wave a kiss, then all my toil goes well;\n    But if she heed me not, for weariness,\n    How long the working day!\n\n\n\n\n*THE MOTOR CAR*\n\n\n    Owlet sat, so quiet and good,\n    At the edge of Yarner Wood,\n    While a mother owl hard by\n    Sought his supper silently.\n\n    Sudden came two hideous screams,\n    Wakened owlet from his dreams;\n    Down the road, on unseen wing,\n    Swept a vast and awful thing.\n\n    Twice he heard the monster shriek,\n    Saw its head and shining beak\n    Twixt huge eyes, that burned the night,\n    Brighter than the moon was bright.\n\n    Hooting horribly it fled--\n    Where the water-meadows spread.\n    \"He will catch,\" thought owlet now,\n    \"That red thing they call the cow.\"\n\n    Came his parent presently:\n    Heard him squeak with fearful glee,\n    \"Mother dear, I\u2019ve seen and heard\n    Such a devil of a bird!\"\n\n\n\n\n*THE SEA SCOUTS*\n\n\n    While all alone I wandered\n    At even by the sea,\n    Where winds and water pondered\n    Of how they came to be;\n    Where kittiwakes were crying\n    And salty spindrift flying\n    Through daylight slowly dying\n    A Shape confronted me.\n\n    She faced the broad Atlantic--\n    That maid of stately mien,\n    Purer than foam, gigantic\n    As Amazonian Queen.\n    Her billowy robe, unknowing,\n    How wild the wind was blowing,\n    Showed not a throb or flowing,\n    Hung steady and serene.\n\n    It was no fellow being\n    For she stood ten feet high,\n    And seaward gazed, unseeing\n    The human passer-by;\n    But only billows roaming,\n    And wide-winged sea-fowl homing\n    Through crepuscule and gloaming\n    Beneath an ashen sky.\n\n    The spectre rose before me\n    Most woeful, wan and white\n    Upon that foreshore stormy\n    Between the day and night;\n    And such an apparition\n    In this unique position,\n    Despite her sad condition\n    Awoke my wild delight.\n\n    Then came three youthful creatures,\n    And them I bade with awe\n    Behold the mournful features\n    Of phantom on the shore.\n    They laughed and said she\u2019d drifted\n    To land with bosom rifted--\n    A figure-head uplifted\n    From wreck of \"Margery Dawe.\"\n\n    They dared, those sea-scout shavers\n    Who watched this lonely coast,\n    Assert in treble quavers\n    We stood before a post;\n    They treated as a fiction\n    My gratified conviction\n    That, in her pale affliction,\n    We\u2019d met a salt-sea ghost!\n\n    Thus hard-eyed youth advances\n    By shadowless, stark way\n    Our middle-aged romances\n    To slight and scorn and slay;\n    Our make-believe to tatter;\n    Our gallant dreams to scatter;\n    To flout our faiths and shatter\n    Our twilight in their day.\n\n\n\n\n*SONG FOR THE SPHERES*\n\n\n    A drop of fire from a flying sun--\n    Sing, old stars, the World\u2019s begun.\n\n    An ocean warm where electrons strive--\n    Sing, old stars, the World\u2019s alive.\n\n    Age upon age and link upon link--\n    Shout, old stars, the World can think.\n\n    War\u2019s red knife hisses home to the haft--\n    Mourn, old stars, the World runs daft.\n\n    Reason and Love shall conquer and reign--\n    Sing, old stars, the World grows sane.\n\n    Liberty, Liberty, Liberty!\n    Shout, old stars, the World is free.\n\n\n\n\n*THE CIRCLE*\n\n\n    When shepherd darkness folds the fading day\n    And faints the West beneath the world\u2019s wide brim,\n    There stands a brotherhood, remote and dim,\n    Of cowled and hooded wights rolled up in granite grey.\n\n    Spirits of dusk from out a far-off prime\n    Beyond the shadowy pale of bygone eld,\n    Immutable and constant and unquelled,\n    They hold their everlasting state and tryst with Time.\n\n    These stones have seen the red-eyed wolf pack throng\n    To slay the fleeting elk upon the waste,\n    And they have marked the cave bear\u2019s clumsy haste,\n    Shuffling great golden furse and ragged rocks among.\n\n    O cirque, what meanest thou?  Sepulchral lore,\n    Or ritual of the quick?  Did thirsty god\n    Drink blood of sacrifice upon this sod?\n    Art thou a temple wrought for deities of yore?\n\n    What dread, what joy, what Neolithic rule,\n    What shouts of agony or p\u00e6ans of praise\n    Awoke, ye stones, the morning of your days?\n    They answer not, but seek the shadowy crepuscule.\n\n    The Stone Man lifted them; his hairy hand\n    They felt and knew, when Night\u2019s eternal brow\n    Gleamed with another diadem than now\n    Ere Egypt\u2019s mountain graves pressed on the desert sand.\n\n    Bowed but enduring, Time hath failed to break\n    That emblem of eternity they trace\n    Upon the bosom of this desolate place;\n    And holy shall it be for their most ancient sake.\n\n    They have withdrawn upon the unseen light\n    Of immemorial time; the vanished past\n    Receives them once again to haunt her vast--\n    A sanctity beyond wild Chaos and old Night.\n\n\n\n\n*TO ANTHEA\u2019S BOSOM*\n\n\n    When that I went, a little lad, to school--\n    One half a cherub and one half a fool--\n    The weary pedant dinned upon my ears\n    That all the world is but two hemispheres.\n\n    Maybe I doubted then, for I was born\n    To laugh the wisdom of the wise to scorn;\n    But now, indeed, most surely it appears\n    That all the world is but two hemispheres.\n\n\n\n\n*DUST*\n\n\n    A cone of dust is dancing at the lane end,\n    Caught from the surface of the thirsty trackway\n    And dropped again, into annihilation,\n    By gusts from nowhere.\n\n    Upon the wheel of little whirlwind moulded,\n    It billows in a wreath of spiral beauty,\n    But, swifter than the smoke of fire dislimning,\n    Endures no longer.\n\n    So I, intrinsical one slippery moment\n    Share with my brief, grey brother at the lane end\n    His buffet into being, then, unfettered,\n    A like dismissal.\n\n    Dust of the cosmos, you alone eternal\n    Immutable behind a myriad garments,\n    Your stars grow ripe upon the boughs of heaven;\n    But you bate nothing.\n\n    All one to you the forms and the reforming,\n    The fashion of the man, or mouse, or mountain:\n    So order be declared and conquered chaos\n    Dethroned for ever.\n\n\n\n\n*YOUNG NIGHT*\n\n\n    When flitter-mice with zigzag flight\n    Specked the green sky at twilight dim;\n    When the wise bird from out the brim\n    Of forest darkness to the light\n    Floated and perched upon a height,\n    With mellow voice to welcome night;\n\n    When day was stolen from the dale\n    To leave, where little river goes,\n    One farewell, dusky gleam of rose;\n    When down the purple of the vale\n    A wing\u00e8d beetle boomed his tale\n    And night-moth drank from night-flow\u2019r pale;\n\n    When grey churn-owl within a glade\n    Purred through the gloaming, till the sky\n    Throbbed with his goblin melody;\n    When, by her stone, the glow-worm played\n    And with an emerald lamp betrayed\n    The new-born dew-drops on the blade;\n\n    When young Night\u2019s self in starry dress\n    Came timid to her throne again--\n    Sweet anodyne for dead day\u2019s pain\n    And fire and wound and fevered stress--\n    With heart to soothe and will to bless,\n    Then how I loved her loveliness!\n\n\n\n\n*JILL BASSETT*\n\n\n    Jill Bassett, she was dancing mad,\n    And any lad\n    Who\u2019d win that most amazing maid\n    Must needs be a light-footed blade.\n\n    So said the folk; but I had pelf,\n    And when the elf\n    Found she might reign at Chadley Wood,\n    Though I weren\u2019t young, she thought it good.\n\n    She danced into my arms, and then,\n    Along of men\n    And some harsh words I\u2019d got to say,\n    One autumn time she danced away.\n\n    She vanished, like a bow on rain,\n    And, to be plain,\n    I didn\u2019t feel no mighty wrench\n    Nor much bewail the giglet wench.\n\n    Then came a bit of funny news\n    From Billy Bewes:\n    He\u2019d seen the wretch at Christmas time\n    Dancing in Plymouth pantomime!\n\n    For five good year no more was heard\n    Of the rash bird;\n    Then danced she back; but not to I:\n    Her mother took her in to die.\n\n    Her breathing parts was nearly gone,\n    Her dancing done.\n    She wilted, like a davered rose;\n    But I forgave her at the close.\n\n    With Bassett folk they dug her pit;\n    It wasn\u2019t fit\n    That she should lie where I shall go:\n    Her mother granted that was so.\n\n    Then, passing New Year\u2019s night, I saw\n    Upon the hoar\n    Of moony frost in churchyard ground\n    The woman dancing on her mound!\n\n    I\u2019ll take my oath afore my God\n    She swept the sod\n    With naked feet and showed her charms\n    And twirled about her twinkling arms.\n\n    A brace of owls that saw her too\n    Made their hulloo,\n    To which she danced so wondrous brave\n    Over the silver on her grave.\n\n    Mayhap the cold got in her bones\n    Under the stones,\n    And up the wilful ghostey came\n    To warm herself at her old game.\n\n    And I was on my hoss\u2019s back--\n    I\u2019d had my whack,\n    But only just the usual three,\n    And no man ever doubted me.\n\n\n\n\n*TAILPIECE*\n\n\n    At turn of night the wild geese fly\n    And waken drowsy wonder\n    Beneath their wing\u00e8d thunder;\n    Then silence falls again,\n    Until the homing barn-owls cry\n    And ring with hollow laughter,\n    From ivy-tod and rafter,\n    The farm upon the plain.\n\n    The lark\u2019s aloft, a bead of gold;\n    While yet the earth lies darkling,\n    His little body\u2019s sparkling:\n    The sun has risen for him.\n    A dotted track on dew-grey fold\n    The weary fox is leaving;\n    I hear the plovers peeving;\n    The morning star grows dim.",
