    "body": "The morning paper lay unread before Philon Miller on the breakfast\ntable and even the prospects of steaming coffee, ham, eggs and orange\njuice could not make him forget his last night's visitors.\n\nOn the closed-circuit Industrial TV screen glowed the words, _Food\nPreparation Center breakfast menu for July 24, 2052. No. 1, orange\njuice, coffee, ham and eggs. No. 2, waffle, coffee...._\n\nAutomatically he punched the button for _No. 1_. Oh, his visitors had\nmade matters appear justifiable. The presidential election campaign\nwas going badly, Rakoff the chairman said, and his poll-quota for the\nelection had been upped from twenty-five grand to fifty.\n\nA stainless-steel capsule popped into the transparent wall dock. Of\ncourse the party quota system was taken for granted, he mused,\nremoving the capsule, but it was an obligation you didn't welsh on.\nThe muscle boys in the party organization saw to that. But still,\nfifty thousand....\n\nAcross the table John, his sixteen-year-old adopted son, stirred. \"I\nguess you aren't as hungry as I am, Phil.\"\n\n\"What? Oh, sorry.\" John--down here for breakfast? What was the\nmatter? The kid sick or something? Every morning he took his meal to\nhis room to eat in solitude. Funny kid.\n\nPhilon removed the food capsule from the wall dock, stopping the soft\ngushing of air in the suction tube. Setting it on the table he snapped\nit open and removed the individual thermocels of food.\n\nPhilon poured coffee from the thermos and absently stirred in cream\nand sugar. Fifty thousand....\n\nJohn was well into his breakfast already. \"Phil, I was down to visit\nthose people on the corner--you know, the house that appeared there\nover-night.\"\n\n\"Um.\"\n\n\"Their name is MacDonald,\" John said. \"And they have a son, Jimmie,\njust my age, and a younger girl, Jean. Gosh, you ought to see the\ninside of their house, Phil. Old-fashioned! At the windows they got\nsomething called venetian blinds instead of our variable mirror\nthermopanes. And you know what? They don't even have an FP connection.\nThey prepare all their meals in the house!\"\n\nJohn's excitement finally aroused Philon's attention. \"No Food\nPreparation service? But that's unheard of!\"\n\n\"They're sure swell people though.\"\n\n\"Where in the world did they come from?\" Philon poured more coffee.\n\n\"Some place out West--Oregon, I think. Lived in a small town.\"\n\n\"How come their house appeared over-night?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I asked them about that,\" John said. \"They said their house is\na prefab and it was cheaper to move it from Oregon than to buy one\nhere. So they moved in one night--lock, stock and barrel.\"\n\nJohn looked at Philon with a tentative air. \"And another thing--Jimmie\nand Jean are their real children.\"\n\nPhilon began to frown in disgust. \"Real children--how vulgar! No one\ndoes that anymore. That custom went out years ago with the Eugenic Act\nof two thousand twenty-nine. Breeding perfect children is the job of\nselected specimens. Why, I remember the day we passed our check over\nto Maternity Clinic! You were the best specimen in the place--and you\ncarried the highest price tag too--ten thousand dollars!\"\n\nAt that moment Ursula, his wife, her green rinse tumbling in stringy\ntufts over her forehead pattered into the breakfast room. Her right\neye was closed in a tight squint against her cigarette smoke.\n\n\"Well, do I get my share of breakfast,\" she muttered, \"or do I have to\nscrabble at the trough like the rest of the hogs around here?\"\n\nPhilon nodded at a third thermocel in the capsule. \"That's yours,\nUrsula.\" He fixed her with a cocked eye. \"What time did that gigolo\nget you home this morning?\"\n\nUrsula blew the hair out of her eyes, then took a good look at her\nhusband. \"Why all the sudden concern about my affairs? I feel like\ngoing to the Cairo I call up Francois. He dances divinely. I feel like\nmaking love I call up Jose....\" She shrugged. \"So, I say, why the\nsudden concern? All these years you say nothing. Every minute away\nfrom home you're involved in big deals to make money, steal\nmoney--maybe even eat it.\"\n\nHe looked at her cryptically. \"I've got to raise a fifty-grand quota.\"\n\nWithout even looking up from her breakfast Ursula said absently, \"Oh,\nthat. It _is_ election year again, isn't it?\"\n\n\"And I'll have to ask you to cancel all unnecessary expenditures for\nthe time being.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"Can't--I've already reserved _Love's Passion_ for\nthis afternoon and a whole block of titles for three months.\"\n\nPhilon compressed his mouth, then practically blew the words at her.\n\"Damn it, Ursula, you're spending too much time psycho-dreaming these\ncheap plays. You know the psychiatrist has warned you to lay off them.\nStimulates your endocrine system too much. No wonder you live on\nsleeping pills.\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up!\" She stared at him, the anger in her tugging at her\nloose mouth. \"If I feel like a psychoplay I'm going to have me a\npsychoplay. It's the only stimulation I get any more.\"\n\nMuttering, \"T'hell with it!\" Philon got up from the table and walked\ninto the living room. Slipping into his gray top coat and hat he\nascended to the copter roofport.\n\nBefore stepping into the copter seat he paused to study the MacDonald\nhouse on the corner. Odd-looking house at that. Mid-twentieth century,\nyet it looked brand new.\n\nThen, putting the house out of mind, Philon shot his copter skyward\nand joined Skyway No. 7 traffic into town.\n\nDescending on his office building he left the ship in care of the\nparking attendant and by elevator dropped to his floor. At a door\nmarked _Miller Electronic Manufacturing Co._ he walked in.\n\nIn his office he slouched into his chair and stared at the small\ncalendar on his desk. Rakoff wanted the fifty-thousand before Royal\nPastel Mink Monday. One week--that wasn't very much time.\n\nFlinching from the unpleasant problem, he stared at the city skyline,\nhis mind drifting lazily. He thought about Royal Pastel Mink Monday.\nSome said it was just another Day dreamed up by furriers to make\npeople fur-conscious. Others said it commemorated a period of great\npublic indifference which cost large numbers their freedom to vote.\n\nOf course the other party had their symbology too--like the Teapot\nCelebration. No one seemed to know for sure what it meant. Anyway, why\nworry how they started? Why did people knock on wood for luck--or\nthrow salt over their left shoulder?\n\nBut then once in awhile there arose some who spelled out a strange\nlonely cry, calling themselves the conscience of the people. They\nspoke sternly of the thin moral fiber of the country, berating the\npeople for what they called their amoral evolution brought on by\nindifference and negligence until they no longer could hear the still\nguiding voice of their conscience. But they were scornfully laughed\ndown and it seemed to Philon he heard less and less of these men.\n\nIn the late afternoon a whip from party headquarters dropped in.\n\"Hello, Feisel,\" Philon said with little enthusiasm for the\nswarthy-faced man.\n\nWithout even the formality of a greeting Feisel smiled down at Philon\nin a half-sneer. \"Well, Philon, how we doin' with the fifty grand,\neh?\"\n\nPhilon tossed a sheaf of papers on the desk with a gesture of\nimpatience. \"Now look, I'll raise the fifty G's by the end of the\nweek.\"\n\nFeisel lifted a thin black eyebrow and shrugged elaborately. \"Just\ninquiring, my friend, just inquiring. You know--just showing friendly\ninterest.\"\n\n\"Well, go peddle your papers to somebody else. You make me nervous.\"\n\nFeisel sniffed with injured pride. \"That's gratitude for you. And just\nwhen I was going to put a little bee in your bonnet. I thought you'd\nlike to know what happened to another guy just like you. You see, he\ngot ideas, instead of digging to get his quota. He tried to lam out\nand you know where they found him? On the sidewalk below his\ntwenty-third-floor window.\"\n\nAs Feisel went out, Philon swore softly at his retreating back. But\nFeisel's little story sent a chill through him.\n\nThat evening when he descended from his copter port and stepped into\nhis living room he was surprised to hear young voices upstairs.\nDeciding to investigate he stepped on the escalator. At John's door he\npoked his head in.\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\nA young blond-headed boy with bright clear eyes turned to look at him\nand a younger girl with short curly hair smiled back.\n\nJohn said, \"Phil, this is Jimmie, and Jean, his sister. They don't\nhave a home-school teleclass rig yet, so they're attending with me.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Philon nodded to the children. \"And how did you like your\nfirst day at school?\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Jean said, beaming until her eyes almost disappeared. \"It was\nfun. The teacher was talking about the history of atomic energy and\nwhen I told her we had one of the first editions of the famous Smyth\nreport on _Atomic Energy_ she was surprised.\"\n\n\"A first edition of the _Smyth Report_? No wonder your teacher was\nsurprised.\" Through Philon's mind ran the recollection that first\neditions of the Smyth Report brought as high as seventy thousand\ndollars.\n\nThe children's excited chatter was suddenly interrupted by the front\ndoor chimes. Stepping to the wall televiewer, Philon pressed a button\nand said, \"Who is it?\"\n\nA pleasant-faced man with a startled look said, \"Oh--sorry. This\ngadget on the door-casing surprised me. Ah--I think my children,\nJimmie and Jean, are here. I'm Bill MacDonald.\"\n\nBehind him Philon heard Jean suppress a dismayed cry. \"Gosh, Jimmie,\nit's late. Daddy's had to come for us!\"\n\nPhilon said, \"And I'm Phil Miller, MacDonald. Come in. We'll be down\nin a moment.\"\n\nThe MacDonald children and John headed for the stairs in a happy rush,\nignoring the descending escalator, two steps at a time. Philon\nfollowed at a meditative pace, his thoughts trooping stealthily\nabreast. Seventy thousand dollars. Now, if he were to....\n\n\"Beautiful home you've got here, Miller.\"\n\nPhilon came out of his daydreaming to see MacDonald coming into view\naround the corner of a living room ell.\n\nPhilon took his extended hand. \"Thanks. Glad you like it.\"\n\nJean broke in breathlessly. \"Oh, Daddy, you ought to see how they\nconduct classes--by school TV. You write on a glass square and it\nappears immediately at the teacher's roll-board. And when you--\"\n\nJimmie interrupted. \"Aw, lemme tell 'im something too, Jean. Dad, John\nused a spare TV for Jean's freshman class while we 'showed' for junior\nclass on his. Gosh, in history, Dad, their old newsreels go back to\nWorld War Two. I even saw your Marine unit--\"\n\nMacDonald cut his son short. \"That's enough, Jimmie. You can tell us\nabout it later.\" He herded his children toward the front door.\n\"Thanks, Miller, for letting the kids use the school TV. I'm having\none installed tomorrow.\"\n\nAfter they left John said with a sparkle Philon had never seen before,\n\"You know, Phil, those are the most interesting kids I've ever met.\nAll the others I know are bored stiff. They've been everyplace and\nthey've done everything.\n\n\"But Jimmie and Jean ask more questions about things than anybody I\nknow. They're really interested. Every time I drop in on them they're\nstudying history beginning with the middle of the Twentieth Century.\nThey're absolutely fascinated and read it like fiction.\"\n\nWith more on his mind than his neighbors' unusual behavior Philon\nsaid, \"Mmm.\" He stood looking at the boy for a long moment until John\nfinally shifted self-consciously.\n\n\"What's the matter, Phil?\"\n\nPhilon ended his musing. \"Tomorrow night we're all going to call on\nthe MacDonalds. And while we're there I want you to slip that copy of\nthe _Smyth Report_ out of their library.\"\n\nFor a moment the young boy's smooth face was a blank mask. Then it\nfilled in with shocked surprise, then resentment and finally anger.\n\"You mean--steal?\"\n\n\"Of course. If they're too innocent to realize the value of the book\nthat's their hard luck.\"\n\n\"But, Phil, I can't imagine myself stealing from....\"\n\nImpatiently, Philon said, \"Since when did you suddenly get so\nholier-than-thou? Life is harsh, life is iron-fisted and if you don't\nkeep your guard up you're going to get socked in the kisser.\"\n\nJohn said slowly with a certain tone of shame, \"Yes, I know. As far\nback as I can remember you've told me that. But in spite of it I can't\nhelp feeling it isn't right to treat the MacDonalds that way. They're\ntoo nice, too good.\"\n\n\"Look, John. You might as well learn the hard facts of life. All the\nhigh-sounding arguments for a moral world and all the laws on the\nbooks implementing those arguments are just eyewash. Sure, the\nPresident swears that he will uphold the constitution and enforce all\nthe laws.\n\n\"Then we carefully surround him with counterspies--wire his rooms with\ndictaphones, slit his mail, install secret informers on his staff. All\nbecause no matter who the party is able to elect we don't trust\nhim--because the society he represents does not trust itself.\"\n\n\"Is that why we have more and bigger jails than ever?\"\n\nPhilon shrugged. \"All I'm trying to tell you is don't go soft-headed\nor the world will take your shirt.\"\n\nThe next day before leaving for the office Philon said to his wife,\n\"Call up the MacDonalds and if they're going to be home tonight tell\nthem we'll be over for a visit.\"\n\nUrsula made a face. \"Do we _have_ to call on those people? They'll\nbore me stiff.\"\n\n\"For heaven's sake, Ursula! It's a matter of vital importance to\nme--and you also, if I have to appeal to your wide streak of\nselfishness.\"\n\n\"I can't see it.\"\n\n\"I'll explain later. I've got to go.\"\n\nDuring the day Ursula called him. \"Well, Phil, I called as you said\nand I've committed us for dinner tonight.\"\n\n\"Dinner! Hmm, they _are_ convivial people.\"\n\n\"Yes and the dinner is going to be cooked right there in their house.\nHow vulgar can some people get?\"\n\nThat evening while dressing Ursula said, \"Phil, John spends a lot of\ntime at the MacDonalds'. What do you suppose he sees in them? It gets\nme the way he quotes them all the time and reports their least doings.\nToday he came tearing into the house and said, 'Ursula, it's\nwonderful!' I said, 'What's wonderful?' And John said, 'The dinner\nthey're cooking at MacDonalds'. I've never smelled anything like it in\nall my life. Why don't we cook in our house like they do? Mrs.\nMacDonald was baking cookies and let me have one right out of the\noven. Mmmm, boy was it _good_!'\"\n\nUrsula finished, \"Now, I ask you, did you ever hear anything so\nbarbaric--cooking in the house and having all the odors permeate the\nwhole place?\"\n\n\"Well, we'll see.\"\n\nLater when they arrived at the MacDonalds' they were welcomed with a\nquiet warmth and friendliness that Philon cynically assumed to be a\nnew and different front.\n\nAs they sat down to dinner Mrs. MacDonald, a rosy-cheeked woman with\na quick and ready smile, said, \"I'm sorry we aren't able to get a\nconnection yet. So everything we're eating tonight is right out of our\ndeep-freeze.\"\n\nJohn Miller said, \"Gosh, Mrs. MacDonald, as far as I'm concerned, I'd\nrather eat from your deep-freeze anytime than from the FP!\"\n\nBill MacDonald looked across the table at Jean and said, \"All right,\nJean.\"\n\nJean and all the MacDonalds bent their heads and the girl began, \"We\nthank Thee for our daily bread as by Thy hands....\"\n\nAs the girl spoke Phil's gaze drifted around to his wife, who lifted\nher shoulders in mystified amazement. But it was a bigger surprise to\nsee John's bent head. For the moment John was a part of this\nfamily--part of a wholeness tied together by an invisible bond. The\nutter strangeness of it shocked Philon into rare clarity of insight.\n\nHe saw himself wrapped up in his business with little regard for\nUrsula or John, letting them exist under his roof without making them\na part of his life. Ursula with her succession of gigolos and her\npsycho-plays and John withdrawn into his upstairs room with his books.\nThen he closed his mind again as if the insight were too blinding.\n\nWhat strange customs these MacDonalds had! Yet he had to admit the\nmeal looked more appetizing than anything he had ever seen. It gave an\nimpression of sumptuous plenty to see the food for everybody in one\nplace instead of individually packaged under glistening thermocel. And\ninstead of throwaway dishes they used chinaware that could have come\nright out of a museum.\n\nUrsula asked, \"What kind of fish is this?\"\n\nBill MacDonald answered with a big grin. \"It's Royal Chinook salmon\nthat I caught in the fish derby on the Columbia River only last--\"\n\nMrs. MacDonald colored suddenly. \"You'll have to forgive Bill. He gets\nhimself so wrapped up in his fishing.\"\n\nGlancing at MacDonald Philon was surprised to see the same confusion\nand embarrassment on his host's face.\n\nIt was after dinner when Mrs. MacDonald and Jean were clearing the\ntable that Philon looked over the library shelves. MacDonald himself\nappeared uneasy and hovered in the background.\n\n\"You'll have to excuse my selections. They're all pretty old.\nI--er--inherited most of them from a grandfather.\"\n\nIn a few minutes Philon spotted the _Smyth Report_. Fixing its\nposition well in mind he turned away. MacDonald was saying, \"Come down\nin the basement and I'll show you my hobby room.\"\n\n\"Glad to.\" As MacDonald led the way Philon whispered to John, \"You'll\nfind the book on the second shelf from the bottom on the right side.\"\n\nJohn returned him a stony stare of belligerence and Philon clamped\nhis jaw. The boy dropped his glance and gave a reluctant nod of\nacquiescence.\n\nUpstairs a half hour later Ursula, who had filled her small ashtray\nwith a mound of stubs, suddenly told Philon she was going home.\n\n\"But, Ursula, I thought that--\"\n\nWith thin-lipped impatience she snapped, \"I just remembered I had\nanother engagement at eight.\"\n\nMrs. MacDonald was genuinely sorry. \"Oh, that's too bad, I thought we\ncould have the whole evening together.\"\n\nCasting a meaningful glance at John and getting a confirming cold-eyed\nnod in return, Philon got on his feet. \"Sorry, folks. Maybe we'll get\ntogether another time.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" MacDonald said.\n\nIn angry silence Philon walked home. Not until they were all in the\nhouse and Ursula was hastening toward her second-floor room did he say\na word. \"I suppose your 'other engagement' means the Cairo again\ntonight?\"\n\nAscending on the escalator Ursula turned to look scornfully over her\nshoulder. \"Yes! Anything to escape from boredom. All that woman talked\nabout while you were in the basement was redecorating the house or\nabout cooking and asking my opinions. _Ugh!_\"\n\nPhilon laughed mirthlessly. \"Yeah, I guess she picked a flat number to\ndiscuss those things with. Anything you might have learned about them\nyou must have got out of a psychoplay.\"\n\nStepping off the escalator at the top Ursula spit a nasty epithet his\nway, then disappeared into the upstairs hall.\n\nJohn stood at the foot of the escalator, a reluctant witness to the\nbickering. Divining his attitude Philon mentally shrugged it off. The\nkid might as well learn what married life was like in these modern\ndays.\n\n\"You got the book, eh?\"\n\nJohn pulled a book from his suit coat and laid it on a small table.\n\"Yes, there's the book--and I never felt so rotten about anything in\nall my life!\"\n\nPhilon said, \"Kid, you've got a lot to learn about getting along in\nthis world.\"\n\n\"All right--so I've got a lot to learn,\" John cried bitterly. \"But\nthere must be more to life than trying to stop the other guy from\nstripping the shirt off your back while you succeed in stripping off\nhis!\"\n\nWith that he took the escalator to the upper hall while Philon watched\nhim disappear.\n\nLeft alone now, Philon settled into a chair by a window and stared\ndown the street at the MacDonald house. Odd people--it almost seemed\nthey didn't belong in this time and period, considering their queer\nways of thinking and looking at things. MacDonald himself in\nparticular had some odd personal attitudes.\n\nLike that incident in his basement--Philon had curiously pulled open a\nheavy steel door to a small cubicle filled with a most complex\narrangement of large coils and heavy insulators and glassed-in\nfilaments. MacDonald was almost rude in closing the door when he found\nPhilon opening it. He had fumbled and stuttered around, explaining the\nroom was a niche where he did a little experimenting on his own. Yes,\nstrange people.\n\nThe next day Philon eagerly hastened to a bookstore dealing in antique\neditions. Hugging the book closely Philon told himself his troubles\nwere all over. The book would surely bring between fifty and a hundred\ngrand.\n\nA clerk approached. \"Can I help you?\"\n\n\"I want to talk to Mr. Norton himself.\"\n\nThe clerk spoke into a wrist transmitter. \"Mr. Norton, a man to see\nyou.\"\n\nIn a few moments a bulbous man came heavily down the aisle, peering\nthrough dark tinted glasses at Philon. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"I have a very rare first edition of Smyth's _Atomic Energy_,\" said\nPhilon, showing the book.\n\nNorton adjusted his glasses, then took the book. He carefully handled\nit, looking over the outside of the covers, then thumbed the pages.\nAfter a long frowning moment, he said, \"Publication date is nineteen\nforty-six but the book's fairly new. Must have been kept hermetically\nsealed in helium for a good many years.\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, it was,\" Philon said matter-of-factly. \"Came from my\npaternal grandfather's side of the family. A book like this ought to\nbe worth at the very least seventy-five thousand.\"\n\nBut the bulbous Mr. Norton was not impressed. He shrugged vaguely.\n\"Well--it's just possible--\" He looked up at Philon suddenly. \"Before\nI make any offer to you I shall have to radiocarbon date the book. Are\nyou willing to sacrifice a back flyleaf in the process?\"\n\n\"Why a flyleaf?\"\n\n\"We have to convert a sample of the book into carbon dioxide to\ngeigercount the radioactivity in the carbon. You see, all living\nthings like the cotton in the rags the paper is made of absorb the\nradioactive carbon fourteen that is formed in the upper atmosphere by\ncosmic radiation. Then it begins to decay and we can measure very\naccurately the amount, which gives us an absolute time span.\"\n\nWith a frustrated feeling Philon agreed. \"Well okay then. It's a waste\nof time I think. The book is obviously a first edition.\"\n\n\"It will take the technician about two hours to complete the analysis.\nWe'll have an answer for you--say after lunch.\"\n\nThe two hours dragged by and Philon eagerly hastened to the store.\n\nWhen Mr. Norton appeared he wore the grim look of a righteously angry\nman. He thrust the book at Philon. \"Here, sir, is your book. The next\ntime you try to foist one over on a book trader remember science is a\nshrewd detective and you'll have to be cleverer than you've been this\ntime. This book is, I'll admit, a clever job, but nevertheless a\nforgery. It was not printed in nineteen forty-six. The radiocarbon\nanalysis fixes its age at a mere five or six years. Good day, sir!\"\n\nPhilon's mouth fell open. \"But--but the MacDonalds have had it\nfor....\" He caught himself, and stammered, \"There must be some mistake\nbecause I....\"\n\nNorton said firmly, \"I bid you good day, sir!\"\n\nWith a sense of the sky falling in on him, Philon found himself out on\nthe street. No one could be trusted nowadays and he shouldn't have\nbeen surprised at the MacDonalds. Everyone had a little sideline, a\ngimmick, to put one over on whoever was gullible enough to swallow it.\n\nWhy should he assume a hillbilly family from way out in Oregon was any\ndifferent? This was probably Bill MacDonald's little racket and it was\njust Philon's bad luck to stumble on it. MacDonald probably peddled\nhis spurious first editions down on Front Street for a few hundred\ndollars to old bookstores unable to afford radiocarbon dating.\n\nFor awhile he stared out his office window, brooding. The fifty grand\njust wasn't to be had--legally or illegally. And when he recalled\nFeisel's little gem about the man falling out his office window Philon\nwas definitely ill.\n\nThen the cunning that comes to the rescue of all scheming gentry who\ndepend on their wits emerged from perverse hiding. An ingenious idea\nto solve the nagging problem of the fifty thousand arrived full-blown.\nGrinning secretively to himself, he walked into the telecommunications\nroom.\n\nHe got the Technical Reference Room at the Public Library and asked\nfor the detailed plans of the big electronic National Vote Tabulating\nmachine in Washington. At the other end a microfilm reel clicked into\nplace, ready to obey his finger-tip control.\n\nFor two hours he read and read, making notes and studying the circuits\nof the complicated machine. Then, satisfied with his information, he\nreturned the microfilm.\n\nLeaving the office he descended to the streets and set out for the\nparty headquarters. Now if only he could sell the neat little idea to\nthe hierarchy....\n\nAt the luxurious marbled headquarters he asked to be let into the\ngeneral chairman's office. The receptionist announced him and Philon\nwalked in to find Rakoff awaiting him behind his beautiful carved\ndesk.\n\nRakoff's dead-white cheeks never stirred and his stiff blond hair\nstood up in a rigid crew cut. He rolled his cigar in his big mouth.\n\"Hello, Miller. What's on your mind?\"\n\nPhilon took a breath and it seemed to him now that this idea was a\ncrazy one. \"I came to tell you I'm unable to raise my fifty grand\nquota, Rakoff.\"\n\nThe man's brows moved slightly and his eyes narrowed significantly.\nWith a rasp in his voice he said deliberately, \"That's too bad, Mr.\nMiller--for you.\"\n\nThe rasping tongue put a faint quaver in Philon's voice but he went\non. \"However, I've brought you an idea that's worth more than fifty\ngrand. It's worth millions.\"\n\nRakoff's eyes hardly blinked. \"I'm listening--you're talking.\"\n\nAnd Philon talked, talked rapidly and convincingly. When he finished\nRakoff slapped his fat thigh in excitement.\n\nThat evening Philon dropped in on Bill MacDonald, who was sitting in\nhis slippers smoking an old fashioned wood pipe.\n\n\"Come in, come in.\" MacDonald greeted him with a friendly smile. \"I\nwas just doing a little reading.\"\n\nPhilon held out the book. \"I'm returning your masterpiece,\" he said\nwith a sardonic smile.\n\nMacDonald received it, glancing at the title. \"Oh, Smyth's _Atomic\nEnergy_. Good book--did you find it interesting?\"\n\n\n\nPhilon began to laugh. \"Well, I'll tell you, Bill, your little racket\nof having spurious first editions printed some place and then peddling\nthem sure caught up with me.\"\n\nThe good-natured smile on MacDonald's face faded in a look of\nincredulity. He took the pipe from his mouth. \"Spurious first\neditions?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I sure took a beating today but I couldn't help laughing over\nit afterwards. Here I've been thinking of you folks as simon-pure\nnumbers. But I got to hand it to you. You sure took me in with Smyth's\n_Atomic Energy_ as being a genuine first edition.\" Philon went on to\nexplain the radiocarbon dating of the book.\n\nMacDonald finally broke in to protest, \"But that book really _is_ over\na hundred years old.\" Then he looked up at his wife. \"Of course,\nCarol, that's the explanation. The radiocarbon wouldn't decay a full\nhundred years any more than we....\" Suddenly, he seemed to catch\nhimself, as his wife raised a hand in apparent agitation.\n\n\"But why did you want to sell my book to a dealer?\" MacDonald\ncontinued.\n\nPhilon went on to explain the system of the poll quota. He told him a\nlot of other things too about the election of a President and the\norganized political machines that levied upon all registered voters\nwhat amounted to a checkoff of their incomes.\n\nCarol MacDonald said, \"You mean that not everyone can vote?\"\n\nPhilon looked at her in surprise. \"Well, of course not. Only people of\nmeans vote--and why shouldn't they? They take the most interest in the\nelections and all the candidates come from the higher-middle-class of\nincome. Anyway why should the people squawk? They took less and less\ninterest in the elections.\n\n\"When the proportion of voters turning out for elections got down to\nthirty percent those that did turn out passed laws disenfranchising\nthose who hadn't voted for two Presidential elections. So if things\naren't being run to suit those who lost their rights to vote they've\ngot no one to thank but themselves.\"\n\nBill MacDonald looked at his wife and said in a voice filled with\nincredulity, \"My lord, Carol, if the people back there only knew what\ntheir careless and negligent disinterest would one day do to their\ncountry!\"\n\nPhilon looked from one to the other, saying, \"You sound as if you were\ntalking about the past.\"\n\nMacDonald said hurriedly, \"I--er--was referring to the history books.\"\n\nThat night Philon did not sleep well for the morrow would be a day\nhe'd never forget. Even to his calloused mind the dangers involved in\nthe exploit were considerable.\n\nIn the morning he went into John's room and stood looking down at the\nboy, who sleepily opened his eyes.\n\nPhilon said, \"I'm going to be gone from my office all day. And if\nanyone calls or comes to see me here at the house tell him I'm sick.\nIf necessary I'm ordering you to swear in court that I was here all\nday and night. Ursula's gone for the weekend to the seashore, so I'm\ndepending on you. Do you understand?\"\n\nJohn frowned in confusion. \"You say you're sick and staying home all\nday?\"\n\nImpatience edging his words Philon went over the explanation again.\n\n\"What d'you mean 'swear in court?' What are you planning to do, Phil?\"\nJohn's eyes were wide open now and full of apprehension.\n\n\"Never mind what I'm doing. Just tell anybody inquiring that I'm sick\nat home.\"\n\n\"You mean _lie_, eh?\"\n\nPhil lifted his hand, then swung, leaving the imprint of his four\nfingers on the boy's left cheek. \"Now do you understand?\"\n\nThe boy blinked back a tear and nodded wordlessly.\n\n\n\nIn the late afternoon Philon landed at Washington and under an assumed\nname made his way to the government building housing the big Election\nTabulator. At the technical maintenance offices Philon asked, \"Is Al\nBrant around?\"\n\n\"Nope. He doesn't come on duty until tomorrow.\"\n\nAt Brant's address Philon knocked on an apartment door. Footsteps\napproached inside and the door was opened by a medium-sized man with\nblack tousled hair. He appeared less than happy to see Philon.\n\n\"Hello, Phil. What's on your mind?\"\n\nPhilon stuck out his hand. \"Al, glad to see you again. I know you're\nnot pleased to see me but let's let bygones be bygones. Can we talk?\"\n\nAl Brant stepped back reluctantly. \"Well, I guess so. I thought we'd\nsaid everything we had to say the last time.\"\n\nPhilon walked in and settled himself on the davenport. \"Yeah, I know,\nAl, we had some pretty harsh words. But at least I got you out of the\nmess.\"\n\nBrant said bitterly, \"Yeah, got me out of a mess I got into helping\nyou on one of your shady deals when I worked for you. Well, as I said\nbefore, what's on your mind?\"\n\nPhilon patted his right chest saying, \"Got a hundred thousand here for\nyou, Al.\"\n\nBrant's brows lifted in amazement. \"A hundred thousand! What's the\ncatch, Phil?\"\n\nPhilon's voice dropped to a confidential tone. \"You always were a\nclever man with electronics, Al, and I've got something here that's\njust your meat. I've been studying the design of the Election\nTabulator, and I've discovered a wonderful opportunity for you and me.\n\n\"Now listen--it's possible to replace two transmitters on the main\nteletype trunk so that a winning percentage of the incoming votes will\nbe totaled up for my party. Simple little job, isn't it? Worth a\nhundred thousand!\"\n\nFor a long moment Al Brant sat and stared at Philon in cold silence.\nFinally, he said, \"Do you know what the penalty is for jimmying the\nTabulator to influence voting?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"It's life imprisonment!\" Brant got up slowly and started across the\nroom to Philon. \"I fell for your line once and got burned--and here\nyou come again. You must think I'm a born sucker. This time I'm doing\nthe talking. Give me the hundred grand or I'll kill you with my bare\nhands!\"\n\nPhilon watched him coming as if he were witness to a nightmare. He was\ntrapped. And in this moment of snowballing fear he ceased to think.\nThe gun in his pocket went off without conscious effort. Brant\nstopped, then collapsed to the floor. Panic took over Philon's mind\nand he fled the apartment building as rapidly as was safe.\n\nHe was almost back in the city when he tuned in a news broadcast As he\nlistened, he sat in stunned silence. Brant had roused himself enough\nbefore he died to talk to the man who found him in his apartment.\nBrant had named his killer as Philon Miller. Miller felt as if he had\nturned to ice.\n\nThen his mind thawed out with a rush of reassuring words. After all,\nwhy should he be worrying? He had John's word in court as a perfect\nalibi. Yes, everything would be all right. Everything _had_ to be all\nright.\n\nIn the late evening Philon arrived at his house with a consuming sense\nof great relief, as if the very act of entering his home would protect\nhim from anything. There was a sense of safety in the mere familiarity\nof the environment.\n\nOn the mail table he found a note from Ursula saying she had gone for\nthe weekend. Philon shrugged indifferently. He was glad to have her\nout of the way anyhow. But John--there was the best ten thousand\ndollars he had ever spent. A sound investment, about to pay its first\nreal dividend.\n\n\"_John!_\" His voice echoed in the house with a disturbing hollow\nsound. He wet his dry lips and shouted again, \"_John_--where _are_\nyou?\"\n\nOnly his echoing voice answered him. In growing fright he pounded up\nthe escalator and rushed into John's room. It was empty. On a desk he\nfound a message in John's neat hand--\n\n     _Phil and Ursula,_\n\n     _For a long time I have been very unhappy living with you.\n     I'm grateful for the food and shelter and education you've\n     provided. But you have never given me the love and warmth\n     that I seem to crave. The funny part of it is that I never\n     understood my craving and what it meant until I saw how love\n     and affection bound the MacDonald kids and their folks._\n\n     _This afternoon Jimmie and Jean came over to say good-by\n     because they said their father told them they didn't belong\n     here--that he was taking his family back where they\n     belonged, atomic bomb threat and all--whatever he meant by\n     that. After they left I got to thinking how much I'd like to\n     go with them. So I'm leaving. Somehow I'm going to talk them\n     into taking me with them wherever they are going. So this\n     will have to be good-by._\n\n                                                    _John._\n\nPhilon lifted his eyes from the note and his glance strayed to the\nwindow. Dreading to look he took two slow steps and peered down the\nstreet. The sight of the empty lot on the corner paralyzed him in his\ntracks.\n\nJohn gone! The MacDonald house gone! Gone was his perfect alibi! In\nWashington a dying man's words had spelled out his own death sentence.\n\nA step at the door roused him from his horror-stricken trance. He\nlooked up to see a detective and a policeman regarding him with cold\ncalculation.\n\n\"What's the matter, Miller?\" asked the detective. \"We've punched your\nannouncer button half a dozen times. You deaf? You better come along\nto Headquarters to answer some questions about your movements today.\"\n\n",
