    "body": "by D. H. Lawrence\n\nAuthor of \u201cWomen in Love\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThere was a little snow on the ground, and the church clock had just\nstruck midnight. Hampstead in the night of winter for once was\nlooking pretty, with clean, white earth and lamps for moon, and dark\nsky above the lamps.\n\nA confused little sound of voices, a gleam of hidden yellow light.\nAnd then the garden door of a tall, dark Georgian house suddenly\nopened, and three people confusedly emerged. A girl in a dark-blue\ncoat and fur turban, very erect; a fellow with a little dispatch\ncase, slouching; a thin man with a red beard, bareheaded, peering\nout of the gateway down the hill that swung in a curve downward\ntoward London.\n\n\u201cLook at it! A new world!\u201d cried the man in the beard ironically, as\nhe stood on the step and peered out.\n\n\u201cNo, Lorenzo! It\u2019s only whitewash!\u201d cried the young man in the\novercoat. His voice was handsome, resonant, plangent, with a weary,\nsardonic touch.\n\nAs he turned back, his face was dark in shadow.\n\nThe girl with the erect, alert head, like a bird, turned back to the\ntwo men.\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d she asked, in her quick, quiet voice.\n\n\u201cLorenzo says it\u2019s a new world. I say it\u2019s only whitewash,\u201d cried\nthe man in the street.\n\nShe stood still and lifted her woolly, gloved finger. She was deaf\nand was taking it in.\n\nYes, she had got it. She gave a quick, chuckling laugh, glanced very\nquickly at the man in the bowler hat, then back at the man in the\nstucco gateway, who was grinning like a satyr and waving good-by.\n\n\u201cGood-by, Lorenzo!\u201d came the resonant, weary cry of the man in the\nbowler hat.\n\n\u201cGood-by!\u201d came the sharp, night-bird call of the girl.\n\nThe green gate slammed, then the inner door. The two were alone in\nthe street, save for the policeman at the corner. The road curved\nsteeply downhill.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better mind how you _step_!\u201d shouted the man in the bowler\nhat, leaning near the erect, sharp girl, and slouching in his walk.\nShe paused a moment, to make sure what he had said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind me, I\u2019m quite all right. Mind yourself!\u201d she said\nquickly. At that very moment he gave a wild lurch on the slippery\nsnow, but managed to save himself from falling. She watched him, on\ntiptoes of alertness. His bowler hat bounced away in the thin snow.\nThey were under a lamp near the curve. As he ducked for his hat he\nshowed a bald spot, just like a tonsure, among his dark, thin,\nrather curly hair. And when he looked up at her, with his thick,\nblack brows sardonically arched, and his rather hooked nose\nself-derisive, jamming his hat on again, he seemed like a satanic\nyoung priest. His face had beautiful lines, like a faun, and a\ndoubtful, martyred expression. A sort of faun on the cross, with all\nthe malice of the complication.\n\n\u201cDid you hurt yourself?\u201d she asked, in her quick, cool, unemotional\nway.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d he shouted derisively.\n\n\u201cGive me the machine, won\u2019t you?\u201d she said, holding out her woolly\nhand. \u201cI believe I\u2019m safer.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you _want_ it?\u201d he shouted.\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m safer.\u201d\n\nHe handed her the little brown dispatch case, which was really a\nMarconi listening machine for her deafness. She marched erect as\never. He shoved his hands deep in his overcoat pockets and slouched\nalong beside her, as if he wouldn\u2019t make his legs firm. The road\ncurved down in front of them, clean and pale with snow under the\nlamps. A motor car came churning up. A few dark figures slipped away\ninto the dark recesses of the houses, like fishes among rocks above\na sea bed of white sand. On the left was a tuft of trees sloping\nupward into the dark.\n\nHe kept looking around, pushing out his finely shaped chin and his\nhooked nose as if he were listening for something. He could still\nhear the motor car climbing on to the Heath. Below was the yellow,\nfoul-smelling glare of the Hampstead tube station. On the right the\ntrees.\n\nThe girl, with her alert, pink-and-white face, looked at him\nsharply, inquisitively. She had an odd, nymphlike inquisitiveness,\nsometimes like a bird, sometimes a squirrel, sometimes a rabbit;\nnever quite like a woman. At last he stood still, as if he would go\nno farther. There was a curious, baffled grin on his smooth,\ncream-colored face.\n\n\u201cJames,\u201d he said loudly to her, leaning toward her ear. \u201cDo you hear\nsomebody _laughing_?\u201d\n\n\u201cLaughing?\u201d she retorted quickly. \u201cWho\u2019s laughing?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. _Somebody!_\u201d he shouted, showing his teeth at her in\na very odd way.\n\n\u201cNo, I hear nobody,\u201d she announced.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s most _extraordinary_!\u201d he cried, his voice slurring up and\ndown. \u201cPut on your machine.\u201d\n\n\u201cPut it on?\u201d she retorted. \u201cWhat for?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo see if you can _hear_ it,\u201d he cried.\n\n\u201cHear what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe _laughing_. Somebody laughing. It\u2019s most _extraordinary_.\u201d\n\nShe gave her odd little chuckle and handed him her machine. He held\nit while she opened the lid and attached the wires, putting the band\nover her head and the receivers at her ears, like a wireless\noperator. Crumbs of snow fell down the cold darkness. She switched\non; little yellow lights in glass tubes shone in the machine. She\nwas connected, she was listening. He stood with his head ducked, his\nhands shoved down in his overcoat pockets.\n\nSuddenly he lifted his face and gave the weirdest, slightly neighing\nlaugh, uncovering his strong, spaced teeth and arching his black\nbrows, and watching her with queer, gleaming, goatlike eyes.\n\nShe seemed a little dismayed.\n\n\u201cThere!\u201d he said. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard _you_!\u201d she said, in a tone which conveyed that _that_ was\nenough.\n\n\u201cBut didn\u2019t you hear _it_?\u201d he cried, unfurling his lips oddly\nagain.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d she said.\n\nHe looked at her vindictively, and stood again with ducked head. She\nremained erect, her fur hat in her hand, her fine bobbed hair banded\nwith the machine band and catching crumbs of snow, her odd,\nbright-eyed, deaf nymph\u2019s face lifted with blank listening.\n\n\u201cThere!\u201d he cried, suddenly jerking up his gleaming face. \u201cYou mean\nto tell me you can\u2019t\u2014\u2014\u201d He was looking at her almost diabolically.\nBut something else was too strong for him. His face wreathed with a\nstartling, peculiar smile, seeming to gleam, and suddenly the most\nextraordinary laugh came bursting out of him, like an animal\nlaughing. It was a strange, neighing sound, amazing in her ears. She\nwas startled, and switched her machine quieter.\n\nA large form loomed up: a tall, cleanshaven young policeman.\n\n\u201cA radio?\u201d he asked laconically.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s my machine. I\u2019m deaf!\u201d said Miss James quickly and\ndistinctly. She was not the daughter of a peer for nothing.\n\nThe man in the bowler hat lifted his face and glared at the\nfresh-faced young policeman with a peculiar white glare in his eyes.\n\n\u201cLook here!\u201d he said distinctly. \u201cDid you hear some one laughing?\u201d\n\n\u201cLaughing! I hear you, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, _not_ me.\u201d He gave an impatient jerk of his arm, and lifted his\nface again. His smooth, creamy face seemed to gleam, there were\nsubtle curves of derisive triumph in all its lines. He was careful\nnot to look directly at the young policeman. \u201cThe most extraordinary\nlaughter I ever heard,\u201d he added, and the same touch of derisive\nexultation sounded in his tones.\n\nThe policeman looked down on him cogitatingly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly all right,\u201d said Miss James coolly. \u201cHe\u2019s not drunk.\nHe just hears something that we don\u2019t hear.\u201d\n\n\u201cDrunk!\u201d echoed the man in the bowler hat, in profoundly amused\nderision. \u201cIf I were merely drunk\u2014\u2014\u201d And off he went again in the\nwild, neighing, animal laughter, while his averted face seemed to\nflash.\n\nAt the sound of the laughter something roused in the blood of the\ngirl and of the policeman. They stood nearer to one another, so that\ntheir sleeves touched and they looked wonderingly across at the man\nin the bowler hat. He lifted his black brows at them.\n\n\u201cDo you mean to say you heard nothing?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cOnly you,\u201d said Miss James.\n\n\u201cOnly you, sir!\u201d echoed the policeman.\n\n\u201cWhat was it like?\u201d asked Miss James.\n\n\u201cAsk me to _describe_ it!\u201d retorted the young man, in extreme\ncontempt. \u201cIt\u2019s the most marvelous sound in the world.\u201d\n\nAnd truly he seemed wrapped up in a new mystery.\n\n\u201cWhere does it come from?\u201d asked Miss James, very practical.\n\n\u201c_Apparently_,\u201d he answered in contempt, \u201cfrom over there.\u201d And he\npointed to the trees and bushes inside the railings over the road.\n\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s go and see!\u201d she said. \u201cI can carry my machine and go\non listening.\u201d\n\nThe man seemed relieved to get rid of the burden. He shoved his\nhands in his pockets again and sloped off across the road. The\npoliceman, a queer look flickering on his fresh young face, put his\nhand round the girl\u2019s arm carefully and subtly, to help her. She did\nnot lean at all on the support of the big hand, but she was\ninterested, so she did not resent it. Having held herself all her\nlife intensely aloof from physical contact, and never having let any\nman touch her, she now, with a certain nymphlike voluptuousness,\nallowed the large hand of the young policeman to support her as they\nfollowed the quick, wolflike figure of the other man across the road\nuphill. And she could feel the presence of the young policeman,\nthrough all the thickness of his dark-blue uniform, as something\nyoung and alert and bright.\n\nWhen they came up to the man in the bowler hat, he was standing with\nhis head ducked, his ears pricked, listening beside the iron rail\ninside which grew big, black holly trees tufted with snow, and old,\nribbed, silent English elms.\n\nThe policeman and the girl stood waiting. She was peering into the\nbushes with the sharp eyes of a deaf nymph, deaf to the world\u2019s\nnoises. The man in the bowler hat listened intensely. A lorry rolled\ndownhill, making the earth tremble.\n\n\u201cThere!\u201d cried the girl, as the lorry rumbled darkly past. And she\nglanced round with flashing eyes at her policeman, her fresh, soft\nface gleaming with startled life. She glanced straight into the\npuzzled, amused eyes of the young policeman. He was just enjoying\nhimself.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d she said, rather imperiously.\n\n\u201cWhat is it, miss?\u201d answered the policeman.\n\n\u201cI mustn\u2019t point,\u201d she said. \u201cLook where I look.\u201d\n\nAnd she looked away with brilliant eyes, into the dark holly bushes.\nShe must see something, for she smiled faintly, with subtle\nsatisfaction, and she tossed her erect head in all the pride of\nvindication. The policeman looked at her instead of into the bushes.\nThere was a certain brilliance of triumph and vindication in all the\npoise of her slim body.\n\n\u201cI always knew I should see him,\u201d she said triumphantly to herself.\n\n\u201cWhom do you see?\u201d shouted the man in the bowler hat.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you see him, too?\u201d she asked, turning round her soft, arch,\nnymphlike face anxiously. She was anxious for the little man to see.\n\n\u201cNo, I see nothing. What do you see, James?\u201d cried the man in the\nbowler hat, insisting.\n\n\u201cA man.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere. Among the holly bushes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he there now?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! He\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat sort of a man?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he look like?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you.\u201d\n\nBut at that instant the man in the bowler hat turned suddenly, and\nthe arch, triumphant look flew to his face.\n\n\u201cWhy, he must be _there_!\u201d he cried, pointing up the grove. \u201cDon\u2019t\nyou hear him laughing? He must be behind those trees.\u201d\n\nAnd his voice, with curious delight, broke into a laugh again, as he\nstood and stamped his feet on the snow, and danced to his own\nlaughter, ducking his head. Then he turned away and ran swiftly up\nthe avenue lined with old trees.\n\nHe slowed down as a door at the end of a garden path, white with\nuntouched snow, suddenly opened, and a woman in a long-fringed black\nshawl stood in the light. She peered out into the night. Then she\ncame down to the low garden gate. Crumbs of snow still fell. She had\ndark hair and a tall, dark comb.\n\n\u201cDid you knock at my door?\u201d she asked of the man in the bowler hat.\n\n\u201cI? No!\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody knocked at my door.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid they? Are you sure? They can\u2019t have done. There are no\nfootmarks in the snow.\u201d\n\n\u201cNor are there!\u201d she said. \u201cBut somebody knocked and called\nsomething.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very curious,\u201d said the man. \u201cWere you expecting some one?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Not exactly expecting any one. Except that one is always\nexpecting Somebody, you know.\u201d In the dimness of the snow-lit night\nhe could see her making big, dark eyes at him.\n\n\u201cWas it some one laughing?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo. It was no one laughing, exactly. Some one knocked, and I ran to\nopen, hoping as one always hopes, you know\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2014that something wonderful is going to happen.\u201d\n\nHe was standing close to the low gate. She stood on the opposite\nside. Her hair was dark, her face seemed dusky, as she looked up at\nhim with her dark, meaningful eyes.\n\n\u201cDid you wish some one would come?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cVery much,\u201d she replied, in her plangent voice.\n\nHe bent down, unlatching the gate. As he did so the woman in the\nblack shawl turned and, glancing over her shoulder, hurried back to\nthe house, walking unevenly in the snow, on her high-heeled shoes.\nThe man hurried after her, hastening like a hound to catch up.\n\nMeanwhile the girl and the policeman had come up. The girl stood\nstill when she saw the man in the bowler hat going up the garden\nwalk after the woman in the black shawl with the fringe.\n\n\u201cIs he going in?\u201d she asked quickly.\n\n\u201cLooks like it, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d said the policeman.\n\n\u201cDoes he know that woman?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say. I should say he soon will,\u201d replied the policeman.\n\n\u201cBut who is she?\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t say who she is.\u201d\n\nThe two dark, confused figures entered the lighted doorway, then the\ndoor closed on them.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d said the girl outside on the snow. She hastily began to\npull off the band of her telephone receiver, and switched off her\nmachine. The tubes of secret light disappeared, she packed up the\nlittle leather case. Then, pulling on her soft fur cap, she stood\nonce more ready.\n\nThe slightly martial look which her long, dark-blue,\nmilitary-seeming coat gave her was intensified, while the slightly\nanxious, bewildered look of her face had gone. She seemed to stretch\nherself, to stretch her limbs free. And the inert look had left her\nfull, soft cheeks. Her cheeks were alive with the glimmer of pride\nand a new, dangerous surety.\n\nShe looked quickly at the tall young policeman. He was cleanshaven,\nfresh-faced, smiling oddly under his helmet, waiting in subtle\npatience a few yards away. She saw that he was a decent young man,\none of the waiting sort.\n\nThe second of ancient fear was followed at once in her by a blithe,\nunaccustomed sense of power.\n\n\u201cWell!\u201d she said. \u201cI should say it\u2019s no use waiting.\u201d She spoke\ndecisively.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to wait for him, do you?\u201d asked the policeman.\n\n\u201cNot at all. He\u2019s much better where he is.\u201d She laughed an odd,\nbrief laugh. Then glancing over her shoulder, she set off down the\nhill, carrying her little case. Her feet felt light, her legs felt\nlong and strong. She glanced over her shoulder again. The young\npoliceman was following her, and she laughed to herself. Her limbs\nfelt so lithe and so strong, if she wished she could easily run\nfaster than he. If she wished, she could easily kill him, even with\nher hands.\n\nSo it seemed to her. But why kill him? He was a decent young fellow.\nShe had in front of her eyes the dark face among the holly bushes,\nwith the brilliant, mocking eyes. Her breast felt full of power, and\nher legs felt long and strong and wild. She was surprised herself at\nthe sensation of triumph and of rosy anger. Her hands felt keen on\nher wrists. She who had always declared she had not a muscle in her\nbody! Even now, it was not muscle, it was a sort of flame.\n\nSuddenly it began to snow heavily, with fierce, frozen puffs of\nwind. The snow was small, in frozen grains, and hit sharp on her\nface. It seemed to whirl round her as if she herself were whirling\nin a cloud. But she did not mind. There was a flame in her, her\nlimbs felt flamey and strong, amid the whirl.\n\nAnd the whirling, snowy air seemed full of presences, full of\nstrange, unheard noises. She was used to the sensation of noises\ntaking place which she could not hear. This sensation became very\nstrong. She felt something was happening in the wild air.\n\nThe London air was no longer heavy and clammy, saturated with ghosts\nof the unwilling dead. A new, clean tempest swept down from the\npole, and there were noises.\n\nVoices were calling. In spite of her deafness she could hear some\none, several voices, calling and whistling, as if many people were\nhallooing through the air:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s come back! Aha! He\u2019s come back!\u201d\n\nThere was a wild, whistling, jubilant sound of voices in the storm\nof snow. Then obscured lightning winked through the snow in the air.\n\n\u201cIs that thunder and lightning?\u201d she asked of the young policeman,\nas she stood still, waiting for his form to emerge through the veil\nof whirling snow.\n\n\u201cSeems like it to me,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd at that very moment the lightning blinked again, and the dark,\nlaughing face was near her face, it almost touched her cheek.\n\nShe started back, but a flame of delight went over her.\n\n\u201cThere!\u201d she said. \u201cDid you see that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt lightened,\u201d said the policeman. She was looking at him almost\nangrily. But then the clean, fresh animal look of his skin, and the\ntame-animal look in his frightened eyes amused her; she laughed her\nlow, triumphant laugh. He was obviously afraid, like a frightened\ndog that sees something uncanny.\n\nThe storm suddenly whistled louder, more violently, and, with a\nstrange noise like castanets, she seemed to hear voices clapping and\ncrying:\n\n\u201cHe is here! He\u2019s come back!\u201d\n\nShe nodded her head gravely.\n\nThe policeman and she moved on side by side. She lived alone in a\nlittle stucco house in a side street down the hill. There was a\nchurch and a grove of trees, and then the little old row of houses.\nThe wind blew fiercely, thick with snow. Now and again a taxi went\nby with its lights showing weirdly. But the world seemed empty,\nuninhabited save by snow and voices.\n\nAs the girl and the policeman turned past the grove of trees near\nthe church, a great whirl of wind and snow made them stand still,\nand in the wild confusion they heard a whirling of sharp, delighted\nvoices, something like seagulls, crying:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s here! He\u2019s here!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m jolly glad he\u2019s back,\u201d said the girl calmly.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said the nervous policeman, hovering near the girl.\n\nThe wind let them move forward. As they passed along the railings it\nseemed to them the doors of the church were open, and the windows\nwere out, and the snow and the voices were blowing in a wild career\nall through the church.\n\n\u201cHow extraordinary that they left the church open!\u201d said the girl.\n\nThe policeman stood still. He could not reply.\n\nAnd as they stood they listened to the wind and the church full of\nwhirling voices all calling confusedly.\n\n\u201c_Now_ I hear the laughing,\u201d she said suddenly.\n\nIt came from the church: a sound of low, subtle, endless laughter, a\nstrange, naked sound.\n\n\u201cNow I hear it!\u201d she said.\n\nBut the policeman did not speak. He stood cowed, listening to the\nstrange noises in the church.\n\nThe wind must have blown out one of the windows, for they could see\nthe snow whirling in volleys through the black gap, and whirling\ninside the church like a dim light. There came a sudden crash,\nfollowed by a burst of chuckling, naked laughter. The snow seemed to\nmake a queer light inside the building, like ghosts moving, big and\ntall.\n\nThere was more laughter, and a tearing sound. On the wind, pieces of\npaper, leaves of books, came whirling among the snow through the\ndark window. Then a white thing, soaring like a crazy bird, rose up\non the wind as if it had wings, and lodged on a black tree outside,\nstruggling. It was the altar cloth.\n\nThere came a bit of gay, trilling music. The wind was running over\nthe organ pipes like Pan pipes, quickly up and down. Snatches of\nwild, gay, trilling music, and bursts of the naked, low laughter.\n\n\u201cReally!\u201d said the girl. \u201cThis is most extraordinary. Do you hear\nthe music and the people laughing?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I hear somebody on the organ!\u201d said the policeman.\n\n\u201cAnd do you get the puff of warm wind? Smelling of spring. Almond\nblossom, that\u2019s what it is! A most marvelous scent of almond\nblossom. Isn\u2019t it an extraordinary thing!\u201d\n\nShe went on triumphantly past the church, and came to the row of\nlittle old houses. She entered her own gate in the little railed\nentrance.\n\n\u201cHere I am!\u201d she said finally. \u201cI\u2019m home now. Thank you very much\nfor coming with me.\u201d\n\nShe looked at the young policeman. His whole body was white as a\nwall with snow, and in the vague light of the arc lamp from the\nstreet his face was humble and frightened.\n\n\u201cCan I come in and warm myself a bit?\u201d he asked humbly. She knew it\nwas fear rather than cold that froze him. He was in mortal fear.\n\n\u201cWell!\u201d she said. \u201cStay down in the sitting room if you like. But\ndon\u2019t come upstairs, because I am alone in the house. You can make\nup the fire in the sitting room, and you can go when you are warm.\u201d\n\nShe left him on the big, low couch before the fire, his face bluish\nand blank with fear. He rolled his blue eyes after her as she left\nthe room. But she went up to her bedroom, and fastened her door.\n\nIn the morning she was in her studio upstairs in her little house,\nlooking at her own paintings and laughing to herself. Her canaries\nwere talking and shrilly whistling in the sunshine that followed the\nstorm. The cold snow outside was still clean, and the white glare in\nthe air gave the effect of much stronger sunshine than actually\nexisted.\n\nShe was looking at her own paintings, and chuckling to herself over\ntheir comicalness. Suddenly they struck her as absolutely absurd.\nShe quite enjoyed looking at them, they seemed to her so grotesque.\nEspecially her self-portrait, with its nice brown hair and its\nslightly opened rabbit mouth and its baffled, uncertain rabbit eyes.\nShe looked at the painted face and laughed in a long, rippling\nlaugh, till the yellow canaries like faded daffodils almost went mad\nin an effort to sing louder. The girl\u2019s long, rippling laugh sounded\nthrough the house uncannily.\n\nThe housekeeper, a rather sad-faced young woman of a superior\nsort\u2014nearly all people in England are of the superior sort,\nsuperiority being an English ailment\u2014came in with an inquiring and\nrather disapproving look.\n\n\u201cDid you call, Miss James?\u201d she asked loudly.\n\n\u201cNo. No, I didn\u2019t call. Don\u2019t shout, I can hear quite well,\u201d replied\nthe girl.\n\nThe housekeeper looked at her again.\n\n\u201cYou knew there was a young man in the sitting room?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNo. Really!\u201d cried the girl. \u201cWhat, the young policeman? I\u2019d\nforgotten all about him. He came in in the storm to warm himself.\nHasn\u2019t he gone?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Miss James.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow extraordinary of him! What time is it? Quarter to nine! Why\ndidn\u2019t he go when he was warm? I must go and see him, I suppose.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe says he\u2019s lame,\u201d said the housekeeper censoriously and loudly.\n\n\u201cLame! That\u2019s extraordinary. He certainly wasn\u2019t last night. But\ndon\u2019t shout. I can hear quite well.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Mr. Marchbanks coming in to breakfast, Miss James?\u201d said the\nhousekeeper, more and more censorious.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t say. But I\u2019ll come down as soon as mine is ready. I\u2019ll\nbe down in a minute, anyhow, to see the policeman. Extraordinary\nthat he is still here.\u201d\n\nShe sat down before her window, in the sun, to think a while. She\ncould see the snow outside, the bare, purplish trees. The air all\nseemed rare and different. Suddenly the world had become quite\ndifferent, as if some skin or integument had broken, as if the old,\nmoldering London sky had crackled and rolled back, like an old skin,\nshriveled, leaving an absolutely new blue heaven.\n\n\u201cIt really is extraordinary!\u201d she said to herself. \u201cI certainly saw\nthat man\u2019s face. What a wonderful face it was!\n\n\u201cI shall never forget it. Such laughter! He laughs longest who\nlaughs last. He certainly will have the last laugh. I like him for\nthat: he will laugh last. Must be some one really extraordinary! How\nvery nice to be the one to laugh last. He certainly will. What a\nwonderful being! I suppose I must call him a being. He\u2019s not a\nperson exactly.\n\n\u201cBut how wonderful of him to come back and alter all the world\nimmediately! _Isn\u2019t_ that extraordinary. I wonder if he\u2019ll have\naltered Marchbanks. Of course, Marchbanks never saw him. But he\nheard him. Wouldn\u2019t that do as well, I wonder! I _wonder_!\u201d\n\nShe went off into a muse about Marchbanks. She and he were such\nfriends. They had been friends like that for almost two years. Never\nlovers. Never that at all. But _friends_.\n\nAnd after all, she had been in love with him: in her head. This\nseemed now so funny to her: that she had been, in her head, so much\nin love with him. After all, life was too absurd.\n\nBecause now she saw herself and him as such a funny pair. He so\nfunnily taking life terribly seriously, especially his own life. And\nshe so ridiculously _determined_ to save him from himself. Oh, how\nabsurd! _Determined_ to save him from himself, and wildly in love\nwith him in the effort. The determination to save him from himself!\n\nAbsurd! Absurd! Absurd! Since she had seen the man laughing among\nthe holly bushes\u2014_such_ extraordinary, wonderful laughter\u2014she had\nseen her own ridiculousness. Really, what fantastic silliness,\nsaving a man from himself! Saving anybody. What fantastic silliness!\nHow much more amusing and lively to let a man go to perdition in his\nown way. Perdition was more amusing than salvation anyhow, and a\nmuch better place for most men to go to.\n\nShe had never been in love with any man, and only spuriously in love\nwith Marchbanks. She saw it quite plainly now. After all, what\nnonsense it all was, this being-in-love business. Thank goodness she\nhad never made the humiliating mistake.\n\nNo, the man among the holly bushes had made her see it all so\nplainly: the ridiculousness of being in love, the _infra dig_\nbusiness of chasing a man or being chased by a man.\n\n\u201cIs love really so absurd and _infra dig_?\u201d she said aloud to\nherself.\n\n\u201cWhy of course!\u201d came a deep, laughing voice.\n\nShe started round, but nobody was to be seen.\n\n\u201cI expect it\u2019s that man again!\u201d she said to herself. \u201cIt really _is_\nremarkable, you know. I consider it\u2019s a remarkable thing that I\nnever really wanted a man\u2014_any_ man. And there I am over thirty. It\n_is_ curious. Whether it\u2019s something wrong with me, or right with\nme, I can\u2019t say. I don\u2019t know till I\u2019ve proved it. But I believe, if\nthat man kept on laughing, something would happen to me.\u201d\n\nShe smelt the curious smell of almond blossom in the room, and heard\nthe distant laugh again.\n\n\u201cI do wonder why Marchbanks went with that woman last night.\nWhatever could he want of her?\u2014or she him? So strange, as if they\nboth had made up their minds to something! How extraordinarily\npuzzling life is! So messy, it all seems.\n\n\u201cWhy does nobody ever laugh in life like that man. He _did_ seem so\nwonderful. So scornful! And so proud! And so real! With those\nlaughing, scornful, amazing eyes, just laughing and disappearing\nagain. I can\u2019t imagine him chasing any woman, thank goodness. It\u2019s\nall so messy. My policeman would be messy if one would let him: like\na dog. I do dislike dogs, really I do. And men do seem so doggy!\u201d\n\nBut even while she mused, she began to laugh again to herself with a\nlong, low chuckle. How wonderful of that man to come and laugh like\nthat and make the sky crack and shrivel like an old skin. Wasn\u2019t he\nwonderful! Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if he just touched her. Even\ntouched her. She felt, if he touched her, she herself would emerge\nnew and tender out of an old, hard skin. She was gazing abstractedly\nout of the window.\n\n\u201cThere he comes, just now,\u201d she said abruptly. But she meant\nMarchbanks, not the laughing man.\n\nThere he came, his hands still shoved down in his overcoat pockets,\nhis head still rather furtively ducked, in the bowler hat, and his\nlegs still rather shambling. He came hurrying across the road, not\nlooking up, deep in thought, no doubt. Thinking profoundly, with\nagonies of agitation, no doubt about his last night\u2019s experience. It\nmade her laugh.\n\nShe, watching from the window above, burst into a long laugh, and\nthe canaries went off their heads again.\n\nHe was in the hall below. His resonant voice was calling, rather\nimperiously:\n\n\u201cJames! Are you coming down?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she called. \u201cYou come up.\u201d\n\nHe came up two at a time, as if his feet were a bit savage with the\nstairs for obstructing him.\n\nIn the doorway he stood staring at her with a vacant, sardonic look,\nhis gray eyes moving with a queer light And she looked back at him\nwith a curious, rather haughty carelessness.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want your breakfast?\u201d she asked. It was his custom to\ncome and take breakfast with her each morning.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he answered loudly. \u201cI went to a tea shop.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t shout,\u201d she said. \u201cI can hear you quite well.\u201d\n\nHe looked at her with mockery and a touch of malice.\n\n\u201cI believe you always could,\u201d he said, still loudly.\n\n\u201cWell, anyway, I can now, so you needn\u2019t shout,\u201d she replied.\n\nAnd again his gray eyes, with the queer, grayish phosphorescent\ngleam in them, lingered malignantly on her face.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at me,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cI know all about everything.\u201d\n\nHe burst into a pouf of malicious laughter.\n\n\u201cWhy, what\u2019s the matter!\u201d he said curiously. \u201cWhat have you been\ndoing?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t quite know. Why? Are you going to call me to account?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you hear that laughing?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes. And many more things. And saw things, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you seen the paper?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Don\u2019t shout, I can hear.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a great storm, blew out the windows and doors of the\nchurch outside here, and pretty well wrecked the place.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw it. A leaf of the church Bible blew right in my face\u2014from\nthe Book of Job.\u201d She gave a low laugh.\n\n\u201cBut what else did you see?\u201d he cried loudly.\n\n\u201cI saw _him_.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, that I can\u2019t say.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what was he like?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat I can\u2019t tell you. I don\u2019t really know.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you must know. Did your policeman see him, too?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t suppose he did. My policeman!\u201d And she went off into a\nlong ripple of laughter. \u201cHe is by no means mine. But I _must_ go\ndownstairs and see him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly made you very strange.\u201d Marchbanks said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got\nno _soul_, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, thank goodness for that!\u201d she cried. \u201cMy policeman has one. I\u2019m\nsure. My _policeman_!\u201d And she went off again into a long peal of\nlaughter, the canaries pealing shrill accompaniment.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHaving no soul. I never had one really. It was always fobbed off on\nme. Soul was the only thing there was between you and me. Thank\ngoodness it\u2019s gone. Haven\u2019t you lost yours? The one that seemed to\nworry you, like a decayed tooth?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what are you _talking_ about?\u201d he cried.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all so extraordinary. But look here,\nI _must_ go down and see my policeman. He\u2019s downstairs in the\nsitting room. You\u2019d better come with me.\u201d\n\nThey went down together. The policeman, in his waistcoat and shirt\nsleeves, was lying on the sofa, with a very long face.\n\n\u201cLook here!\u201d said Miss James to him. \u201cIs it true you\u2019re lame?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is true. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I can\u2019t walk,\u201d said the\nfair-haired young man as tears came to his eyes.\n\n\u201cBut how did it happen? You weren\u2019t lame last night,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how it happened\u2014but when I woke up and tried to stand\nup, I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d The tears ran down his distressed face.\n\n\u201cHow very extraordinary!\u201d she said. \u201cWhat can we do about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich foot is it?\u201d asked Marchbanks. \u201cLet us have a look at it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to,\u201d said the poor devil.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better,\u201d said Miss James.\n\nHe slowly pulled off his stocking, and showed his white left foot\ncuriously clubbed, like the weird paw of some animal. When he looked\nat it himself, he sobbed.\n\nAnd as he sobbed, the girl heard again the low, exulting laughter.\nBut she paid no heed to it, gazing curiously at the weeping young\npoliceman.\n\n\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cIt does if I try to walk on it,\u201d wept the young man.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll telephone for a doctor, and\nhe can take you home in a taxi.\u201d\n\nThe young fellow shamefacedly wiped his eyes.\n\n\u201cBut have you no idea how it happened?\u201d asked Marchbanks anxiously.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t myself,\u201d said the young fellow.\n\nAt that moment the girl heard the low, eternal laugh right in her\near. She started, but could see nothing.\n\nShe started round again as Marchbanks gave a strange, yelping cry,\nlike a shot animal. His white face was drawn, distorted in a curious\ngrin, that was chiefly agony but partly wild recognition. He was\nstaring with fixed eyes at something. And in the rolling agony of\nhis eyes was the horrible grin of a man who realizes he has made a\nfinal, and this time fatal, fool of himself.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d he yelped in a high voice, \u201cI knew it was he!\u201d And with a\nqueer, shuddering laugh he pitched forward on the carpet and lay\nwrithing for a moment on the floor. Then he lay still, in a weird,\ndistorted position, like a man struck by lightning.\n\nMiss James stared with round, staring brown eyes.\n\n\u201cIs he dead?\u201d she asked quickly.\n\nThe young policeman was trembling so that he could hardly speak. She\ncould hear his teeth chattering.\n\n\u201cSeems like it,\u201d he stammered.\n\nThere was a faint smell of almond blossom in the air.",
