    "body": "\u2018IF you talk of Murphy and Francis Moore, gentlemen,\u2019 said the\nlamplighter who was in the chair, \u2018I mean to say that neither of \u2019em ever\nhad any more to do with the stars than Tom Grig had.\u2019\n\n\u2018And what had _he_ to do with \u2019em?\u2019 asked the lamplighter who officiated\nas vice.\n\n\u2018Nothing at all,\u2019 replied the other; \u2018just exactly nothing at all.\u2019\n\n\u2018Do you mean to say you don\u2019t believe in Murphy, then?\u2019 demanded the\nlamplighter who had opened the discussion.\n\n\u2018I mean to say I believe in Tom Grig,\u2019 replied the chairman.  \u2018Whether I\nbelieve in Murphy, or not, is a matter between me and my conscience; and\nwhether Murphy believes in himself, or not, is a matter between him and\nhis conscience.  Gentlemen, I drink your healths.\u2019\n\nThe lamplighter who did the company this honour, was seated in the\nchimney-corner of a certain tavern, which has been, time out of mind, the\nLamplighters\u2019 House of Call.  He sat in the midst of a circle of\nlamplighters, and was the cacique, or chief of the tribe.\n\nIf any of our readers have had the good fortune to behold a lamplighter\u2019s\nfuneral, they will not be surprised to learn that lamplighters are a\nstrange and primitive people; that they rigidly adhere to old ceremonies\nand customs which have been handed down among them from father to son\nsince the first public lamp was lighted out of doors; that they\nintermarry, and betroth their children in infancy; that they enter into\nno plots or conspiracies (for who ever heard of a traitorous\nlamplighter?); that they commit no crimes against the laws of their\ncountry (there being no instance of a murderous or burglarious\nlamplighter); that they are, in short, notwithstanding their apparently\nvolatile and restless character, a highly moral and reflective people:\nhaving among themselves as many traditional observances as the Jews, and\nbeing, as a body, if not as old as the hills, at least as old as the\nstreets.  It is an article of their creed that the first faint glimmering\nof true civilisation shone in the first street-light maintained at the\npublic expense.  They trace their existence and high position in the\npublic esteem, in a direct line to the heathen mythology; and hold that\nthe history of Prometheus himself is but a pleasant fable, whereof the\ntrue hero is a lamplighter.\n\n\u2018Gentlemen,\u2019 said the lamplighter in the chair, \u2018I drink your healths.\u2019\n\n\u2018And perhaps, Sir,\u2019 said the vice, holding up his glass, and rising a\nlittle way off his seat and sitting down again, in token that he\nrecognised and returned the compliment, \u2018perhaps you will add to that\ncondescension by telling us who Tom Grig was, and how he came to be\nconnected in your mind with Francis Moore, Physician.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hear, hear, hear!\u2019 cried the lamplighters generally.\n\n\u2018Tom Grig, gentlemen,\u2019 said the chairman, \u2018was one of us; and it happened\nto him, as it don\u2019t often happen to a public character in our line, that\nhe had his what-you-may-call-it cast.\u2019\n\n\u2018His head?\u2019 said the vice.\n\n\u2018No,\u2019 replied the chairman, \u2018not his head.\u2019\n\n\u2018His face, perhaps?\u2019 said the vice.  \u2018No, not his face.\u2019  \u2018His legs?\u2019\n\u2018No, not his legs.\u2019  Nor yet his arms, nor his hands, nor his feet, nor\nhis chest, all of which were severally suggested.\n\n\u2018His nativity, perhaps?\u2019\n\n\u2018That\u2019s it,\u2019 said the chairman, awakening from his thoughtful attitude at\nthe suggestion.  \u2018His nativity.  That\u2019s what Tom had cast, gentlemen.\u2019\n\n\u2018In plaster?\u2019 asked the vice.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t rightly know how it\u2019s done,\u2019 returned the chairman.  \u2018But I\nsuppose it was.\u2019\n\nAnd there he stopped as if that were all he had to say; whereupon there\narose a murmur among the company, which at length resolved itself into a\nrequest, conveyed through the vice, that he would go on.  This being\nexactly what the chairman wanted, he mused for a little time, performed\nthat agreeable ceremony which is popularly termed wetting one\u2019s whistle,\nand went on thus:\n\n\u2018Tom Grig, gentlemen, was, as I have said, one of us; and I may go\nfurther, and say he was an ornament to us, and such a one as only the\ngood old times of oil and cotton could have produced.  Tom\u2019s family,\ngentlemen, were all lamplighters.\u2019\n\n\u2018Not the ladies, I hope?\u2019 asked the vice.\n\n\u2018They had talent enough for it, Sir,\u2019 rejoined the chairman, \u2018and would\nhave been, but for the prejudices of society.  Let women have their\nrights, Sir, and the females of Tom\u2019s family would have been every one of\n\u2019em in office.  But that emancipation hasn\u2019t come yet, and hadn\u2019t then,\nand consequently they confined themselves to the bosoms of their\nfamilies, cooked the dinners, mended the clothes, minded the children,\ncomforted their husbands, and attended to the house-keeping generally.\nIt\u2019s a hard thing upon the women, gentlemen, that they are limited to\nsuch a sphere of action as this; very hard.\n\n\u2018I happen to know all about Tom, gentlemen, from the circumstance of his\nuncle by his mother\u2019s side, having been my particular friend.  His\n(that\u2019s Tom\u2019s uncle\u2019s) fate was a melancholy one.  Gas was the death of\nhim.  When it was first talked of, he laughed.  He wasn\u2019t angry; he\nlaughed at the credulity of human nature.  \u201cThey might as well talk,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cof laying on an everlasting succession of glow-worms;\u201d and then he\nlaughed again, partly at his joke, and partly at poor humanity.\n\n\u2018In course of time, however, the thing got ground, the experiment was\nmade, and they lighted up Pall Mall.  Tom\u2019s uncle went to see it.  I\u2019ve\nheard that he fell off his ladder fourteen times that night, from\nweakness, and that he would certainly have gone on falling till he killed\nhimself, if his last tumble hadn\u2019t been into a wheelbarrow which was\ngoing his way, and humanely took him home.  \u201cI foresee in this,\u201d says\nTom\u2019s uncle faintly, and taking to his bed as he spoke\u2014\u201cI foresee in\nthis,\u201d he says, \u201cthe breaking up of our profession.  There\u2019s no more\ngoing the rounds to trim by daylight, no more dribbling down of the oil\non the hats and bonnets of ladies and gentlemen when one feels in\nspirits.  Any low fellow can light a gas-lamp.  And it\u2019s all up.\u201d  In\nthis state of mind, he petitioned the government for\u2014I want a word again,\ngentlemen\u2014what do you call that which they give to people when it\u2019s found\nout, at last, that they\u2019ve never been of any use, and have been paid too\nmuch for doing nothing?\u2019\n\n\u2018Compensation?\u2019 suggested the vice.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s it,\u2019 said the chairman.  \u2018Compensation.  They didn\u2019t give it him,\nthough, and then he got very fond of his country all at once, and went\nabout saying that gas was a death-blow to his native land, and that it\nwas a plot of the radicals to ruin the country and destroy the oil and\ncotton trade for ever, and that the whales would go and kill themselves\nprivately, out of sheer spite and vexation at not being caught.  At last\nhe got right-down cracked; called his tobacco-pipe a gas-pipe; thought\nhis tears were lamp-oil; and went on with all manner of nonsense of that\nsort, till one night he hung himself on a lamp-iron in Saint Martin\u2019s\nLane, and there was an end of _him_.\n\n\u2018Tom loved him, gentlemen, but he survived it.  He shed a tear over his\ngrave, got very drunk, spoke a funeral oration that night in the\nwatch-house, and was fined five shillings for it, in the morning.  Some\nmen are none the worse for this sort of thing.  Tom was one of \u2019em.  He\nwent that very afternoon on a new beat: as clear in his head, and as free\nfrom fever as Father Mathew himself.\n\n\u2018Tom\u2019s new beat, gentlemen, was\u2014I can\u2019t exactly say where, for that he\u2019d\nnever tell; but I know it was in a quiet part of town, where there were\nsome queer old houses.  I have always had it in my head that it must have\nbeen somewhere near Canonbury Tower in Islington, but that\u2019s a matter of\nopinion.  Wherever it was, he went upon it, with a bran-new ladder, a\nwhite hat, a brown holland jacket and trousers, a blue neck-kerchief, and\na sprig of full-blown double wall-flower in his button-hole.  Tom was\nalways genteel in his appearance, and I have heard from the best judges,\nthat if he had left his ladder at home that afternoon, you might have\ntook him for a lord.\n\n\u2018He was always merry, was Tom, and such a singer, that if there was any\nencouragement for native talent, he\u2019d have been at the opera.  He was on\nhis ladder, lighting his first lamp, and singing to himself in a manner\nmore easily to be conceived than described, when he hears the clock\nstrike five, and suddenly sees an old gentleman with a telescope in his\nhand, throw up a window and look at him very hard.\n\n\u2018Tom didn\u2019t know what could be passing in this old gentleman\u2019s mind.  He\nthought it likely enough that he might be saying within himself, \u201cHere\u2019s\na new lamplighter\u2014a good-looking young fellow\u2014shall I stand something to\ndrink?\u201d  Thinking this possible, he keeps quite still, pretending to be\nvery particular about the wick, and looks at the old gentleman sideways,\nseeming to take no notice of him.\n\n\u2018Gentlemen, he was one of the strangest and most mysterious-looking files\nthat ever Tom clapped his eyes on.  He was dressed all slovenly and\nuntidy, in a great gown of a kind of bed-furniture pattern, with a cap of\nthe same on his head; and a long old flapped waistcoat; with no braces,\nno strings, very few buttons\u2014in short, with hardly any of those\nartificial contrivances that hold society together.  Tom knew by these\nsigns, and by his not being shaved, and by his not being over-clean, and\nby a sort of wisdom not quite awake, in his face, that he was a\nscientific old gentleman.  He often told me that if he could have\nconceived the possibility of the whole Royal Society being boiled down\ninto one man, he should have said the old gentleman\u2019s body was that Body.\n\n\u2018The old gentleman claps the telescope to his eye, looks all round, sees\nnobody else in sight, stares at Tom again, and cries out very loud:\n\n\u2018\u201cHal-loa!\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cHalloa, Sir,\u201d says Tom from the ladder; \u201cand halloa again, if you come\nto that.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cHere\u2019s an extraordinary fulfilment,\u201d says the old gentleman, \u201cof a\nprediction of the planets.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cIs there?\u201d says Tom.  \u201cI\u2019m very glad to hear it.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cYoung man,\u201d says the old gentleman, \u201cyou don\u2019t know me.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cSir,\u201d says Tom, \u201cI have not that honour; but I shall be happy to drink\nyour health, notwithstanding.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cI read,\u201d cries the old gentleman, without taking any notice of this\npoliteness on Tom\u2019s part\u2014\u201cI read what\u2019s going to happen, in the stars.\u201d\n\n\u2018Tom thanked him for the information, and begged to know if anything\nparticular was going to happen in the stars, in the course of a week or\nso; but the old gentleman, correcting him, explained that he read in the\nstars what was going to happen on dry land, and that he was acquainted\nwith all the celestial bodies.\n\n\u2018\u201cI hope they\u2019re all well, Sir,\u201d says Tom,\u2014\u201ceverybody.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cHush!\u201d cries the old gentleman.  \u201cI have consulted the book of Fate\nwith rare and wonderful success.  I am versed in the great sciences of\nastrology and astronomy.  In my house here, I have every description of\napparatus for observing the course and motion of the planets.  Six months\nago, I derived from this source, the knowledge that precisely as the\nclock struck five this afternoon a stranger would present himself\u2014the\ndestined husband of my young and lovely niece\u2014in reality of illustrious\nand high descent, but whose birth would be enveloped in uncertainty and\nmystery.  Don\u2019t tell me yours isn\u2019t,\u201d says the old gentleman, who was in\nsuch a hurry to speak that he couldn\u2019t get the words out fast enough,\n\u201cfor I know better.\u201d\n\n\u2018Gentlemen, Tom was so astonished when he heard him say this, that he\ncould hardly keep his footing on the ladder, and found it necessary to\nhold on by the lamp-post.  There _was_ a mystery about his birth.  His\nmother had always admitted it.  Tom had never known who was his father,\nand some people had gone so far as to say that even _she_ was in doubt.\n\n\u2018While he was in this state of amazement, the old gentleman leaves the\nwindow, bursts out of the house-door, shakes the ladder, and Tom, like a\nripe pumpkin, comes sliding down into his arms.\n\n\u2018\u201cLet me embrace you,\u201d he says, folding his arms about him, and nearly\nlighting up his old bed-furniture gown at Tom\u2019s link.  \u201cYou\u2019re a man of\nnoble aspect.  Everything combines to prove the accuracy of my\nobservations.  You have had mysterious promptings within you,\u201d he says;\n\u201cI know you have had whisperings of greatness, eh?\u201d he says.\n\n\u2018\u201cI think I have,\u201d says Tom\u2014Tom was one of those who can persuade\nthemselves to anything they like\u2014\u201cI\u2019ve often thought I wasn\u2019t the small\nbeer I was taken for.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cYou were right,\u201d cries the old gentleman, hugging him again.  \u201cCome in.\nMy niece awaits us.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cIs the young lady tolerable good-looking, Sir?\u201d says Tom, hanging fire\nrather, as he thought of her playing the piano, and knowing French, and\nbeing up to all manner of accomplishments.\n\n\u2018\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful!\u201d cries the old gentleman, who was in such a terrible\nbustle that he was all in a perspiration.  \u201cShe has a graceful carriage,\nan exquisite shape, a sweet voice, a countenance beaming with animation\nand expression; and the eye,\u201d he says, rubbing his hands, \u201cof a startled\nfawn.\u201d\n\n\u2018Tom supposed this might mean, what was called among his circle of\nacquaintance, \u201ca game eye;\u201d and, with a view to this defect, inquired\nwhether the young lady had any cash.\n\n\u2018\u201cShe has five thousand pounds,\u201d cries the old gentleman.  \u201cBut what of\nthat? what of that?  A word in your ear.  I\u2019m in search of the\nphilosopher\u2019s stone.  I have very nearly found it\u2014not quite.  It turns\neverything to gold; that\u2019s its property.\u201d\n\n\u2018Tom naturally thought it must have a deal of property; and said that\nwhen the old gentleman did get it, he hoped he\u2019d be careful to keep it in\nthe family.\n\n\u2018\u201cCertainly,\u201d he says, \u201cof course.  Five thousand pounds!  What\u2019s five\nthousand pounds to us?  What\u2019s five million?\u201d he says.  \u201cWhat\u2019s five\nthousand million?  Money will be nothing to us.  We shall never be able\nto spend it fast enough.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cWe\u2019ll try what we can do, Sir,\u201d says Tom.\n\n\u2018\u201cWe will,\u201d says the old gentleman.  \u201cYour name?\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cGrig,\u201d says Tom.\n\n\u2018The old gentleman embraced him again, very tight; and without speaking\nanother word, dragged him into the house in such an excited manner, that\nit was as much as Tom could do to take his link and ladder with him, and\nput them down in the passage.\n\n\u2018Gentlemen, if Tom hadn\u2019t been always remarkable for his love of truth, I\nthink you would still have believed him when he said that all this was\nlike a dream.  There is no better way for a man to find out whether he is\nreally asleep or awake, than calling for something to eat.  If he\u2019s in a\ndream, gentlemen, he\u2019ll find something wanting in flavour, depend upon\nit.\n\n\u2018Tom explained his doubts to the old gentleman, and said that if there\nwas any cold meat in the house, it would ease his mind very much to test\nhimself at once.  The old gentleman ordered up a venison pie, a small\nham, and a bottle of very old Madeira.  At the first mouthful of pie and\nthe first glass of wine, Tom smacks his lips and cries out, \u201cI\u2019m\nawake\u2014wide awake;\u201d and to prove that he was so, gentlemen, he made an end\nof \u2019em both.\n\n\u2018When Tom had finished his meal (which he never spoke of afterwards\nwithout tears in his eyes), the old gentleman hugs him again, and says,\n\u201cNoble stranger! let us visit my young and lovely niece.\u201d  Tom, who was a\nlittle elevated with the wine, replies, \u201cThe noble stranger is\nagreeable!\u201d  At which words the old gentleman took him by the hand, and\nled him to the parlour; crying as he opened the door, \u201cHere is Mr. Grig,\nthe favourite of the planets!\u201d\n\n\u2018I will not attempt a description of female beauty, gentlemen, for every\none of us has a model of his own that suits his own taste best.  In this\nparlour that I\u2019m speaking of, there were two young ladies; and if every\ngentleman present, will imagine two models of his own in their places,\nand will be kind enough to polish \u2019em up to the very highest pitch of\nperfection, he will then have a faint conception of their uncommon\nradiance.\n\n\u2018Besides these two young ladies, there was their waiting-woman, that\nunder any other circumstances Tom would have looked upon as a Venus; and\nbesides her, there was a tall, thin, dismal-faced young gentleman, half\nman and half boy, dressed in a childish suit of clothes very much too\nshort in the legs and arms; and looking, according to Tom\u2019s comparison,\nlike one of the wax juveniles from a tailor\u2019s door, grown up and run to\nseed.  Now, this youngster stamped his foot upon the ground and looked\nvery fierce at Tom, and Tom looked fierce at him\u2014for to tell the truth,\ngentlemen, Tom more than half suspected that when they entered the room\nhe was kissing one of the young ladies; and for anything Tom knew, you\nobserve, it might be _his_ young lady\u2014which was not pleasant.\n\n\u2018\u201cSir,\u201d says Tom, \u201cbefore we proceed any further, will you have the\ngoodness to inform me who this young Salamander\u201d\u2014Tom called him that for\naggravation, you perceive, gentlemen\u2014\u201cwho this young Salamander may be?\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cThat, Mr. Grig,\u201d says the old gentleman, \u201cis my little boy.  He was\nchristened Galileo Isaac Newton Flamstead.  Don\u2019t mind him.  He\u2019s a mere\nchild.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cAnd a very fine child too,\u201d says Tom\u2014still aggravating, you\u2019ll\nobserve\u2014\u201cof his age, and as good as fine, I have no doubt.  How do you\ndo, my man?\u201d with which kind and patronising expressions, Tom reached up\nto pat him on the head, and quoted two lines about little boys, from\nDoctor Watts\u2019s Hymns, which he had learnt at a Sunday School.\n\n\u2018It was very easy to see, gentlemen, by this youngster\u2019s frowning and by\nthe waiting-maid\u2019s tossing her head and turning up her nose, and by the\nyoung ladies turning their backs and talking together at the other end of\nthe room, that nobody but the old gentleman took very kindly to the noble\nstranger.  Indeed, Tom plainly heard the waiting-woman say of her master,\nthat so far from being able to read the stars as he pretended, she didn\u2019t\nbelieve he knew his letters in \u2019em, or at best that he had got further\nthan words in one syllable; but Tom, not minding this (for he was in\nspirits after the Madeira), looks with an agreeable air towards the young\nladies, and, kissing his hand to both, says to the old gentleman, \u201cWhich\nis which?\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cThis,\u201d says the old gentleman, leading out the handsomest, if one of\n\u2019em could possibly be said to be handsomer than the other\u2014\u201cthis is my\nniece, Miss Fanny Barker.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cIf you\u2019ll permit me, Miss,\u201d says Tom, \u201cbeing a noble stranger and a\nfavourite of the planets, I will conduct myself as such.\u201d  With these\nwords, he kisses the young lady in a very affable way, turns to the old\ngentleman, slaps him on the back, and says, \u201cWhen\u2019s it to come off, my\nbuck?\u201d\n\n\u2018The young lady coloured so deep, and her lip trembled so much,\ngentlemen, that Tom really thought she was going to cry.  But she kept\nher feelings down, and turning to the old gentleman, says, \u201cDear uncle,\nthough you have the absolute disposal of my hand and fortune, and though\nyou mean well in disposing of \u2019em thus, I ask you whether you don\u2019t think\nthis is a mistake?  Don\u2019t you think, dear uncle,\u201d she says, \u201cthat the\nstars must be in error?  Is it not possible that the comet may have put\n\u2019em out?\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cThe stars,\u201d says the old gentleman, \u201ccouldn\u2019t make a mistake if they\ntried.  Emma,\u201d he says to the other young lady.\n\n\u2018\u201cYes, papa,\u201d says she.\n\n\u2018\u201cThe same day that makes your cousin Mrs. Grig will unite you to the\ngifted Mooney.  No remonstrance\u2014no tears.  Now, Mr. Grig, let me conduct\nyou to that hallowed ground, that philosophical retreat, where my friend\nand partner, the gifted Mooney of whom I have just now spoken, is even\nnow pursuing those discoveries which shall enrich us with the precious\nmetal, and make us masters of the world.  Come, Mr. Grig,\u201d he says.\n\n\u2018\u201cWith all my heart, Sir,\u201d replies Tom; \u201cand luck to the gifted Mooney,\nsay I\u2014not so much on his account as for our worthy selves!\u201d  With this\nsentiment, Tom kissed his hand to the ladies again, and followed him out;\nhaving the gratification to perceive, as he looked back, that they were\nall hanging on by the arms and legs of Galileo Isaac Newton Flamstead, to\nprevent him from following the noble stranger, and tearing him to pieces.\n\n\u2018Gentlemen, Tom\u2019s father-in-law that was to be, took him by the hand, and\nhaving lighted a little lamp, led him across a paved court-yard at the\nback of the house, into a very large, dark, gloomy room: filled with all\nmanner of bottles, globes, books, telescopes, crocodiles, alligators, and\nother scientific instruments of every kind.  In the centre of this room\nwas a stove or furnace, with what Tom called a pot, but which in my\nopinion was a crucible, in full boil.  In one corner was a sort of ladder\nleading through the roof; and up this ladder the old gentleman pointed,\nas he said in a whisper:\n\n\u2018\u201cThe observatory.  Mr. Mooney is even now watching for the precise time\nat which we are to come into all the riches of the earth.  It will be\nnecessary for he and I, alone in that silent place, to cast your nativity\nbefore the hour arrives.  Put the day and minute of your birth on this\npiece of paper, and leave the rest to me.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say,\u201d says Tom, doing as he was told and giving him\nback the paper, \u201cthat I\u2019m to wait here long, do you?  It\u2019s a precious\ndismal place.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cHush!\u201d says the old gentleman.  \u201cIt\u2019s hallowed ground.  Farewell!\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cStop a minute,\u201d says Tom.  \u201cWhat a hurry you\u2019re in!  What\u2019s in that\nlarge bottle yonder?\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cIt\u2019s a child with three heads,\u201d says the old gentleman; \u201cand everything\nelse in proportion.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cWhy don\u2019t you throw him away?\u201d says Tom.  \u201cWhat do you keep such\nunpleasant things here for?\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cThrow him away!\u201d cries the old gentleman.  \u201cWe use him constantly in\nastrology.  He\u2019s a charm.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have thought it,\u201d says Tom, \u201cfrom his appearance.  _Must_\nyou go, I say?\u201d\n\n\u2018The old gentleman makes him no answer, but climbs up the ladder in a\ngreater bustle than ever.  Tom looked after his legs till there was\nnothing of him left, and then sat down to wait; feeling (so he used to\nsay) as comfortable as if he was going to be made a freemason, and they\nwere heating the pokers.\n\n\u2018Tom waited so long, gentlemen, that he began to think it must be getting\non for midnight at least, and felt more dismal and lonely than ever he\nhad done in all his life.  He tried every means of whiling away the time,\nbut it never had seemed to move so slow.  First, he took a nearer view of\nthe child with three heads, and thought what a comfort it must have been\nto his parents.  Then he looked up a long telescope which was pointed out\nof the window, but saw nothing particular, in consequence of the stopper\nbeing on at the other end.  Then he came to a skeleton in a glass case,\nlabelled, \u201cSkeleton of a Gentleman\u2014prepared by Mr. Mooney,\u201d\u2014which made\nhim hope that Mr. Mooney might not be in the habit of preparing gentlemen\nthat way without their own consent.  A hundred times, at least, he looked\ninto the pot where they were boiling the philosopher\u2019s stone down to the\nproper consistency, and wondered whether it was nearly done.  \u201cWhen it\nis,\u201d thinks Tom, \u201cI\u2019ll send out for six-penn\u2019orth of sprats, and turn \u2019em\ninto gold fish for a first experiment.\u201d  Besides which, he made up his\nmind, gentlemen, to have a country-house and a park; and to plant a bit\nof it with a double row of gas-lamps a mile long, and go out every night\nwith a French-polished mahogany ladder, and two servants in livery behind\nhim, to light \u2019em for his own pleasure.\n\n\u2018At length and at last, the old gentleman\u2019s legs appeared upon the steps\nleading through the roof, and he came slowly down: bringing along with\nhim, the gifted Mooney.  This Mooney, gentlemen, was even more scientific\nin appearance than his friend; and had, as Tom often declared upon his\nword and honour, the dirtiest face we can possibly know of, in this\nimperfect state of existence.\n\n\u2018Gentlemen, you are all aware that if a scientific man isn\u2019t absent in\nhis mind, he\u2019s of no good at all.  Mr. Mooney was so absent, that when\nthe old gentleman said to him, \u201cShake hands with Mr. Grig,\u201d he put out\nhis leg.  \u201cHere\u2019s a mind, Mr. Grig!\u201d cries the old gentleman in a\nrapture.  \u201cHere\u2019s philosophy!  Here\u2019s rumination!  Don\u2019t disturb him,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cfor this is amazing!\u201d\n\n\u2018Tom had no wish to disturb him, having nothing particular to say; but he\nwas so uncommonly amazing, that the old gentleman got impatient, and\ndetermined to give him an electric shock to bring him to\u2014\u201cfor you must\nknow, Mr. Grig,\u201d he says, \u201cthat we always keep a strongly charged\nbattery, ready for that purpose.\u201d  These means being resorted to,\ngentlemen, the gifted Mooney revived with a loud roar, and he no sooner\ncame to himself than both he and the old gentleman looked at Tom with\ncompassion, and shed tears abundantly.\n\n\u2018\u201cMy dear friend,\u201d says the old gentleman to the Gifted, \u201cprepare him.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cI say,\u201d cries Tom, falling back, \u201cnone of that, you know.  No preparing\nby Mr. Mooney if you please.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cAlas!\u201d replies the old gentleman, \u201cyou don\u2019t understand us.  My friend,\ninform him of his fate.\u2014I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u2018The Gifted mustered up his voice, after many efforts, and informed Tom\nthat his nativity had been carefully cast, and he would expire at exactly\nthirty-five minutes, twenty-seven seconds, and five-sixths of a second\npast nine o\u2019clock, a.m., on that day two months.\n\n\u2018Gentlemen, I leave you to judge what were Tom\u2019s feelings at this\nannouncement, on the eve of matrimony and endless riches.  \u201cI think,\u201d he\nsays in a trembling voice, \u201cthere must be a mistake in the working of\nthat sum.  Will you do me the favour to cast it up again?\u201d\u2014\u201cThere is no\nmistake,\u201d replies the old gentleman, \u201cit is confirmed by Francis Moore,\nPhysician.  Here is the prediction for to-morrow two months.\u201d  And he\nshowed him the page, where sure enough were these words\u2014\u201cThe decease of a\ngreat person may be looked for, about this time.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cWhich,\u201d says the old gentleman, \u201cis clearly you, Mr. Grig.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cToo clearly,\u201d cries Tom, sinking into a chair, and giving one hand to\nthe old gentleman, and one to the Gifted.  \u201cThe orb of day has set on\nThomas Grig for ever!\u201d\n\n\u2018At this affecting remark, the Gifted shed tears again, and the other two\nmingled their tears with his, in a kind\u2014if I may use the expression\u2014of\nMooney and Co.\u2019s entire.  But the old gentleman recovering first,\nobserved that this was only a reason for hastening the marriage, in order\nthat Tom\u2019s distinguished race might be transmitted to posterity; and\nrequesting the Gifted to console Mr. Grig during his temporary absence,\nhe withdrew to settle the preliminaries with his niece immediately.\n\n\u2018And now, gentlemen, a very extraordinary and remarkable occurrence took\nplace; for as Tom sat in a melancholy way in one chair, and the Gifted\nsat in a melancholy way in another, a couple of doors were thrown\nviolently open, the two young ladies rushed in, and one knelt down in a\nloving attitude at Tom\u2019s feet, and the other at the Gifted\u2019s.  So far,\nperhaps, as Tom was concerned\u2014as he used to say\u2014you will say there was\nnothing strange in this: but you will be of a different opinion when you\nunderstand that Tom\u2019s young lady was kneeling to the Gifted, and the\nGifted\u2019s young lady was kneeling to Tom.\n\n\u2018\u201cHalloa! stop a minute!\u201d cries Tom; \u201chere\u2019s a mistake.  I need condoling\nwith by sympathising woman, under my afflicting circumstances; but we\u2019re\nout in the figure.  Change partners, Mooney.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cMonster!\u201d cries Tom\u2019s young lady, clinging to the Gifted.\n\n\u2018\u201cMiss!\u201d says Tom.  \u201cIs _that_ your manners?\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cI abjure thee!\u201d cries Tom\u2019s young lady.  \u201cI renounce thee.  I never\nwill be thine.  Thou,\u201d she says to the Gifted, \u201cart the object of my\nfirst and all-engrossing passion.  Wrapt in thy sublime visions, thou\nhast not perceived my love; but, driven to despair, I now shake off the\nwoman and avow it.  Oh, cruel, cruel man!\u201d  With which reproach she laid\nher head upon the Gifted\u2019s breast, and put her arms about him in the\ntenderest manner possible, gentlemen.\n\n\u2018\u201cAnd I,\u201d says the other young lady, in a sort of ecstasy, that made Tom\nstart\u2014\u201cI hereby abjure my chosen husband too.  Hear me, Goblin!\u201d\u2014this was\nto the Gifted\u2014\u201cHear me!  I hold thee in the deepest detestation.  The\nmaddening interview of this one night has filled my soul with love\u2014but\nnot for thee.  It is for thee, for thee, young man,\u201d she cries to Tom.\n\u201cAs Monk Lewis finely observes, Thomas, Thomas, I am thine, Thomas,\nThomas, thou art mine: thine for ever, mine for ever!\u201d with which words,\nshe became very tender likewise.\n\n\u2018Tom and the Gifted, gentlemen, as you may believe, looked at each other\nin a very awkward manner, and with thoughts not at all complimentary to\nthe two young ladies.  As to the Gifted, I have heard Tom say often, that\nhe was certain he was in a fit, and had it inwardly.\n\n\u2018\u201cSpeak to me!  Oh, speak to me!\u201d cries Tom\u2019s young lady to the Gifted.\n\n\u2018\u201cI don\u2019t want to speak to anybody,\u201d he says, finding his voice at last,\nand trying to push her away.  \u201cI think I had better go.  I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m\nfrightened,\u201d he says, looking about as if he had lost something.\n\n\u2018\u201cNot one look of love!\u201d she cries.  \u201cHear me while I declare\u2014\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cI don\u2019t know how to look a look of love,\u201d he says, all in a maze.\n\u201cDon\u2019t declare anything.  I don\u2019t want to hear anybody.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d cries the old gentleman (who it seems had been\nlistening).  \u201cThat\u2019s right!  Don\u2019t hear her.  Emma shall marry you\nto-morrow, my friend, whether she likes it or not, and _she_ shall marry\nMr. Grig.\u201d\n\n\u2018Gentlemen, these words were no sooner out of his mouth than Galileo\nIsaac Newton Flamstead (who it seems had been listening too) darts in,\nand spinning round and round, like a young giant\u2019s top, cries, \u201cLet her.\nLet her.  I\u2019m fierce; I\u2019m furious.  I give her leave.  I\u2019ll never marry\nanybody after this\u2014never.  It isn\u2019t safe.  She is the falsest of the\nfalse,\u201d he cries, tearing his hair and gnashing his teeth; \u201cand I\u2019ll live\nand die a bachelor!\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cThe little boy,\u201d observed the Gifted gravely, \u201calbeit of tender years,\nhas spoken wisdom.  I have been led to the contemplation of woman-kind,\nand will not adventure on the troubled waters of matrimony.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cWhat!\u201d says the old gentleman, \u201cnot marry my daughter!  Won\u2019t you,\nMooney?  Not if I make her?  Won\u2019t you?  Won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cNo,\u201d says Mooney, \u201cI won\u2019t.  And if anybody asks me any more, I\u2019ll run\naway, and never come back again.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cMr. Grig,\u201d says the old gentleman, \u201cthe stars must be obeyed.  You have\nnot changed your mind because of a little girlish folly\u2014eh, Mr. Grig?\u201d\n\n\u2018Tom, gentlemen, had had his eyes about him, and was pretty sure that all\nthis was a device and trick of the waiting-maid, to put him off his\ninclination.  He had seen her hiding and skipping about the two doors,\nand had observed that a very little whispering from her pacified the\nSalamander directly.  \u201cSo,\u201d thinks Tom, \u201cthis is a plot\u2014but it won\u2019t\nfit.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cEh, Mr. Grig?\u201d says the old gentleman.\n\n\u2018\u201cWhy, Sir,\u201d says Tom, pointing to the crucible, \u201cif the soup\u2019s nearly\nready\u2014\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cAnother hour beholds the consummation of our labours,\u201d returned the old\ngentleman.\n\n\u2018\u201cVery good,\u201d says Tom, with a mournful air.  \u201cIt\u2019s only for two months,\nbut I may as well be the richest man in the world even for that time.\nI\u2019m not particular, I\u2019ll take her, Sir.  I\u2019ll take her.\u201d\n\n\u2018The old gentleman was in a rapture to find Tom still in the same mind,\nand drawing the young lady towards him by little and little, was joining\ntheir hands by main force, when all of a sudden, gentlemen, the crucible\nblows up, with a great crash; everybody screams; the room is filled with\nsmoke; and Tom, not knowing what may happen next, throws himself into a\nFancy attitude, and says, \u201cCome on, if you\u2019re a man!\u201d without addressing\nhimself to anybody in particular.\n\n\u2018\u201cThe labours of fifteen years!\u201d says the old gentleman, clasping his\nhands and looking down upon the Gifted, who was saving the pieces, \u201care\ndestroyed in an instant!\u201d\u2014And I am told, gentlemen, by-the-bye, that this\nsame philosopher\u2019s stone would have been discovered a hundred times at\nleast, to speak within bounds, if it wasn\u2019t for the one unfortunate\ncircumstance that the apparatus always blows up, when it\u2019s on the very\npoint of succeeding.\n\n\u2018Tom turns pale when he hears the old gentleman expressing himself to\nthis unpleasant effect, and stammers out that if it\u2019s quite agreeable to\nall parties, he would like to know exactly what has happened, and what\nchange has really taken place in the prospects of that company.\n\n\u2018\u201cWe have failed for the present, Mr. Grig,\u201d says the old gentleman,\nwiping his forehead.  \u201cAnd I regret it the more, because I have in fact\ninvested my niece\u2019s five thousand pounds in this glorious speculation.\nBut don\u2019t be cast down,\u201d he says, anxiously\u2014\u201cin another fifteen years,\nMr. Grig\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d cries Tom, letting the young lady\u2019s hand fall.  \u201cWere the stars\nvery positive about this union, Sir?\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cThey were,\u201d says the old gentleman.\n\n\u2018\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear it,\u201d Tom makes answer, \u201cfor it\u2019s no go, Sir.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cNo what!\u201d cries the old gentleman.\n\n\u2018\u201cGo, Sir,\u201d says Tom, fiercely.  \u201cI forbid the banns.\u201d  And with these\nwords\u2014which are the very words he used\u2014he sat himself down in a chair,\nand, laying his head upon the table, thought with a secret grief of what\nwas to come to pass on that day two months.\n\n\u2018Tom always said, gentlemen, that that waiting-maid was the artfullest\nminx he had ever seen; and he left it in writing in this country when he\nwent to colonize abroad, that he was certain in his own mind she and the\nSalamander had blown up the philosopher\u2019s stone on purpose, and to cut\nhim out of his property.  I believe Tom was in the right, gentlemen; but\nwhether or no, she comes forward at this point, and says, \u201cMay I speak,\nSir?\u201d and the old gentleman answering, \u201cYes, you may,\u201d she goes on to say\nthat \u201cthe stars are no doubt quite right in every respect, but Tom is not\nthe man.\u201d  And she says, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember, Sir, that when the clock\nstruck five this afternoon, you gave Master Galileo a rap on the head\nwith your telescope, and told him to get out of the way?\u201d  \u201cYes, I do,\u201d\nsays the old gentleman.  \u201cThen,\u201d says the waiting-maid, \u201cI say he\u2019s the\nman, and the prophecy is fulfilled.\u201d  The old gentleman staggers at this,\nas if somebody had hit him a blow on the chest, and cries, \u201cHe! why he\u2019s\na boy!\u201d  Upon that, gentlemen, the Salamander cries out that he\u2019ll be\ntwenty-one next Lady-day; and complains that his father has always been\nso busy with the sun round which the earth revolves, that he has never\ntaken any notice of the son that revolves round him; and that he hasn\u2019t\nhad a new suit of clothes since he was fourteen; and that he wasn\u2019t even\ntaken out of nankeen frocks and trousers till he was quite unpleasant in\n\u2019em; and touches on a good many more family matters to the same purpose.\nTo make short of a long story, gentlemen, they all talk together, and cry\ntogether, and remind the old gentleman that as to the noble family, his\nown grandfather would have been lord mayor if he hadn\u2019t died at a dinner\nthe year before; and they show him by all kinds of arguments that if the\ncousins are married, the prediction comes true every way.  At last, the\nold gentleman being quite convinced, gives in; and joins their hands; and\nleaves his daughter to marry anybody she likes; and they are all well\npleased; and the Gifted as well as any of them.\n\n\u2018In the middle of this little family party, gentlemen, sits Tom all the\nwhile, as miserable as you like.  But, when everything else is arranged,\nthe old gentleman\u2019s daughter says, that their strange conduct was a\nlittle device of the waiting-maid\u2019s to disgust the lovers he had chosen\nfor \u2019em, and will he forgive her? and if he will, perhaps he might even\nfind her a husband\u2014and when she says that, she looks uncommon hard at\nTom.  Then the waiting-maid says that, oh dear! she couldn\u2019t abear Mr.\nGrig should think she wanted him to marry her; and that she had even gone\nso far as to refuse the last lamplighter, who was now a literary\ncharacter (having set up as a bill-sticker); and that she hoped Mr. Grig\nwould not suppose she was on her last legs by any means, for the baker\nwas very strong in his attentions at that moment, and as to the butcher,\nhe was frantic.  And I don\u2019t know how much more she might have said,\ngentlemen (for, as you know, this kind of young women are rare ones to\ntalk), if the old gentleman hadn\u2019t cut in suddenly, and asked Tom if he\u2019d\nhave her, with ten pounds to recompense him for his loss of time and\ndisappointment, and as a kind of bribe to keep the story secret.\n\n\u2018\u201cIt don\u2019t much matter, Sir,\u201d says Tom, \u201cI ain\u2019t long for this world.\nEight weeks of marriage, especially with this young woman, might\nreconcile me to my fate.  I think,\u201d he says, \u201cI could go off easy after\nthat.\u201d  With which he embraces her with a very dismal face, and groans in\na way that might move a heart of stone\u2014even of philosopher\u2019s stone.\n\n\u2018\u201cEgad,\u201d says the old gentleman, \u201cthat reminds me\u2014this bustle put it out\nof my head\u2014there was a figure wrong.  He\u2019ll live to a green old\nage\u2014eighty-seven at least!\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cHow much, Sir?\u201d cries Tom.\n\n\u2018\u201cEighty-seven!\u201d says the old gentleman.\n\n\u2018Without another word, Tom flings himself on the old gentleman\u2019s neck;\nthrows up his hat; cuts a caper; defies the waiting-maid; and refers her\nto the butcher.\n\n\u2018\u201cYou won\u2019t marry her!\u201d says the old gentleman, angrily.\n\n\u2018\u201cAnd live after it!\u201d says Tom.  \u201cI\u2019d sooner marry a mermaid with a\nsmall-tooth comb and looking-glass.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cThen take the consequences,\u201d says the other.\n\n\u2018With those words\u2014I beg your kind attention here, gentlemen, for it\u2019s\nworth your notice\u2014the old gentleman wetted the forefinger of his right\nhand in some of the liquor from the crucible that was spilt on the floor,\nand drew a small triangle on Tom\u2019s forehead.  The room swam before his\neyes, and he found himself in the watch-house.\u2019\n\n\u2018Found himself _where_?\u2019 cried the vice, on behalf of the company\ngenerally.\n\n\u2018In the watch-house,\u2019 said the chairman.  \u2018It was late at night, and he\nfound himself in the very watch-house from which he had been let out that\nmorning.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he go home?\u2019 asked the vice.\n\n\u2018The watch-house people rather objected to that,\u2019 said the chairman; \u2018so\nhe stopped there that night, and went before the magistrate in the\nmorning.  \u201cWhy, you\u2019re here again, are you?\u201d says the magistrate, adding\ninsult to injury; \u201cwe\u2019ll trouble you for five shillings more, if you can\nconveniently spare the money.\u201d  Tom told him he had been enchanted, but\nit was of no use.  He told the contractors the same, but they wouldn\u2019t\nbelieve him.  It was very hard upon him, gentlemen, as he often said, for\nwas it likely he\u2019d go and invent such a tale?  They shook their heads and\ntold him he\u2019d say anything but his prayers\u2014as indeed he would; there\u2019s no\ndoubt about that.  It was the only imputation on his moral character that\never _I_ heard of.\u2019",
