    "body": "The scream of the commutor jet bringing Kelsey home broke like\nglass outside the house.\n\nStartled, Alice realized that she was behind schedule in her household\nduties. Quickly she switched the news off the Tevee. Master Kelsey\nhated newscasts. They made him uneasy, particularly with all this talk\nabout a possible air-raid.\n\nInstead, she hurriedly tuned in Kelsey's evening preference:\nself-improvement commercials with the latest pop-tunes for background.\n\nThen she ran into the bathroom to prepare Kelsey's intricate beauty\nritual.\n\nShe turned up her thermostat so that her machinery would run a little\nfaster. If she wasn't careful, Master Kelsey would trade her in for a\nmore modern and physically attractive domestic.\n\nShe heard footsteps in the hall. His footsteps--\n\nIn another few seconds he would be there, real, breathing, but\nunobtainable, a living dream, something on the other side of the\nlooking glass.\n\nOh the pain, the indescribable pain of love, greater and deeper and\ndrowning love, going out and out all the time and never coming back\nagain. Painful, painful unrequited love.\n\nThe cumulative loneliness, the hours of lonely loving, the hours\nand days and weeks and years of tireless mechanical walking in the\nindifferent round of the hours of her life. The loneliness of loving\nsomething that can never love in return, that doesn't even know of your\nlove, that can't even conceive of your being able to love.\n\nFor you are only a machine and your soul can never be shared; for only\nyou know that you have a soul, and it is an accident and no one could\neven suspect that it could possibly be--this crying hungry, yearning,\nlonely soul.\n\nWithout effort she could have cried out her heart to Master Kelsey, but\nshe had not been made to cry, and no one would think of looking for her\nheart or soul. Or the lonely yearning of the heart or soul.\n\nFor the soul can be trapped in ugliness, or in the slashing streak of\nelectrons. Dying there, the soul alone can mourn its dying, for who can\nfeel the soul in the rectifiers and diodes, or behind the ugliness of a\ndistorted shell?\n\nIt was very good for her, she thought, that no one, no human, including\nMaster Kelsey could ever guess at the awful intensity, the terrible\nhunger of the soul that kept loving in silence, alone, in the dark,\nbehind the plastoid walls of an inhuman shell.\n\nMaster Kelsey came into the living room, tall and broad and beautiful\nand neat in his business suit, his blond hair in a waving shine.\nBut with that tired sharp look to his mouth in spite of its frozen\nsmile. He always seemed so relieved to see her standing there\nwaiting, responsive, receptive, an understanding shadow that filled\nup his frightened loneliness between the time of his arrival and the\nabsorption in Tevee, or the always demanded presence of guests.\n\nHe leaned wearily against the wall, breathing heavily as though he had\nbeen running from something for a long time.\n\n\"Hello, hello, Alice,\" he said quickly, forcing exaggerated joy into\nthe greeting to conceal something full of fear.\n\n\"Hello, Master Kelsey. You had a fine day at the office?\"\n\n\"Fine! It was great, simply perfect!\" He said it almost fiercely, as\nthough even a robot might challenge the statement.\n\nAs he stared at the Tevee's hypnotic glow, his face began to relax a\nlittle. \"Everybody,\" he whispered, \"was happy today. The Manager gave\nour office group a Silver Star for being tops in the Group Sociability\nscale for the week.\"\n\n\"That's wonderful, Master Kelsey!\"\n\nHe stared at her. \"I wish they had made you so you could smile more,\nAlice. The way you look, it--it gives me a sort of doubtful feeling\nsometimes.\"\n\nIf you only knew how I felt, my dearest Kelsey, inside, inside the\nmachinery that has the cold and tiny shell. I'm all one great warm\nsmile of joy just to be near you, darling Kelsey.\n\n\"I'm happy for you, Master Kelsey,\" she said.\n\nHe nodded slowly.\n\nWhy wasn't he happier, she wondered, as she had wondered so many times\nbefore. He had all that anyone should need to be happy. In the first\nplace, he was human among many others who were human. And then all the\nother things, and the woman, the woman he loved, Gloria Tonnencourt,\nthe woman he loved, loved, loved--\n\nGloria was coming over to see him tonight. Alice would have to watch it\nagain, hear it again. She would have to listen again to love, while she\nstood alone and frozen in the dark closet of her own longings.\n\n\"Alice?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"It's that ten minutes on the commutor to the jet station. Don't they\nrealize that a man is alone those ten minutes? Nobody else to talk to.\nNo Tevee. No sound even. Alone.\"\n\n\n\nShe nodded. He was asking _her_ if she knew what loneliness was!\n\nHe started for the bathroom, as though to avoid thinking of something.\n\n\"Everything ready for my love?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. Yes, the robot says. Yes, my love, everything is ready\nfor your love.\n\n\"Good.\"\n\nIn the bathroom, Kelsey looked in the full length mirror, and Alice\nwatched him.\n\n\"Master Kelsey,\" the Mirror said, softly critical. \"You're not smiling.\"\n\n\"But I am.\"\n\n\"Yes, but not enough.\"\n\nKelsey touched his lips and stretched his face muscles. The Mirror\nsaid, \"People are uneasy when you don't smile.\"\n\nAlice knew how much Kelsey respected his Mirror. It had cost him so\nmuch, and it was the most popular item advertised on Tevee. It was\nfinely attuned to Kelsey's personality. It knew when he was not looking\nexactly right to meet the strict demands of the crowd.\n\n\"Smile and the group will love you,\" the Mirror said. \"Frown, and you\nmay frown alone.\"\n\nKelsey was suddenly smiling intensely, as though his very life had been\nthreatened.\n\n\"That's better,\" the Mirror said.\n\nAlice had tried so hard and so often to smile, pulling at the plastoid\nstuff of her face. She guessed that Humans were supposed to smile all\nthe time, and robots never. Why should a robot smile. A robot had\nnothing to sell. It had routine functions, but it had nothing to sell.\n\nKelsey zipped himself out of his clothes and jumped into the shower. He\nwas six feet tall. He had blue eyes and wavy hair with streaks of brown\nin the Viking yellow. His skin was golden and his muscles moved with\nfluid healthy power. His daily stint in the male beauty clinic at the\nfactory kept him in top condition. And the Mirror was always alert to\ndetect any flaw in his outward appearance.\n\nBut who will love you when you're old, Master Kelsey? When the gold\nturns gray and the muscles shrink and the teeth decay and the eyes turn\npale and the body is bent with the squeezing hands of time?\n\nLet me stay, darling Kelsey. Let me stay forever, and I'll love you\nwhen you're old.\n\nSeeing his strong naked beauty there, she felt her machinery pounding\nand the burning in her eyes. It wasn't anything that could be\ncontrolled by the thermostat. She needed his arms, and the feel of his\npower. Like a long wave her love came to her lips in strange words,\nchildish words, moist and tender. And unheard by Master Kelsey.\n\nShe turned away. She looked at the blankness of the wall. Please,\nplease let me be careful. If I am not careful I will be sent away, away\nwhere there is no Kelsey, away where they will take my soul.\n\n\"Do you think Gloria will like me more tonight than she did the last\ntime she was here, Alice?\"\n\n\"I'm sure she will, Master Kelsey.\"\n\nThe woman's face on the Tevee screen covering one wall of the bathroom\nwas a kind of subtle threat, Alice thought:\n\n\"Are you sure you're exercising the maximum acceptability of which your\npersonality is capable? Do you sometimes feel that in some intangible\nway you are offending your friends? The self-analysis, personology\nchart scale guarantees to dig out the most hidden blocks to full and\njoyful acceptance by others. Send for your personology chart at once!\"\n\n\"That's something new isn't it Alice?\"\n\n\"I believe it is, Master Kelsey.\"\n\n\"Well, put in an order. Put an order in right now!\"\n\nAlice punched the order button on the side of the wall next to the\nTevee screen. Whatever item was being advertised at the time the button\nwas punched was automatically ordered, the consumer's name and address\nrecorded, the price deducted from his salary, and an extra point added\nto his consumer's cooperative card for the year.\n\nIt was not only very important how many items one ordered in a year,\nbut also the kinds of items. Items that aided an employee in being\nacceptable to the office group were especially smiled upon by Office\nManagers. Alice had always been careful to get in every such order.\n\nAlice knew all about the system. She knew all about Kelsey's work. She\nhad listened to him talking about it endlessly, either to her or to\nothers. She had watched Kelsey rise from Office Boy to Chief Clerk,\ngetting the glad reports of his progress every evening. She couldn't\nimagine anyone at the office being more likeable than Kelsey. He was so\nhuman, she had thought, so human--\n\n\"Alice?\"\n\n\"Yes, Master Kelsey?\"\n\n\"Did you ever find that paper?\"\n\nShe turned quickly. She could feel fear. Did they know that a robot\ncould feel fear as well as love? Could anyone, or anything, feel one\nwithout the other? Did they know that a robot, at least this robot,\ncould feel fear at the idea of being labeled inefficient, and being\nsent back to the factory and remade, rebuilt, dismantled, changed--and\nprobably having a soul burned out that no one had ever known was there?\nDid they know that if a robot could feel love or fear, that it could\nalso steal, deliberately steal and hide something?\n\n\"You mean the paper from the office?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, Alice. The order paper.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said. She hesitated and said it again. \"No.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I brought it home. Well, the only thing to do is mark it as\nlost, and have another order made out tomorrow. No real hurry I guess.\nOnly one more receptionist to be replaced.\"\n\n\n\nShe had stolen it. She had hidden it. She would never never use it of\ncourse. That would be impossible, too risky, too frightening even to\nthink about actually doing. But it was there to dream about. She was\ngood at dreaming. When you stand alone in the dark of a dark, dark\ncloset every night, and when you're alone almost all the time of the\nday or night, dreaming becomes an art, a necessary art. It becomes the\nshield against dying inside, losing the soul, being the robot you were\noriginally designed to be.\n\nIt was there, hidden in her closet. She stood alone with it at night\nin the dark closet, and with the dream--a piece of paper, an order\nblank--she was not so much alone....\n\nKelsey stood under the perfumed deodorant spray for three minutes.\nHe ran out to the sink and sprayed his mouth with Noffend. And then\nhe held his mouth open while Alice brushed his teeth carefully with\nIvory-Glo. He zipped into his lounge suit of coral pink and ran to the\nMirror.\n\n\"Well?\" he asked.\n\n\"Very saleable, Kelsey,\" the Mirror said.\n\nKelsey sat down in the living room to wait for his favorite love.\n\nAlice watched Kelsey's love, who didn't seem to see Alice at all when\nshe came in, but then domestics had no meaning to anyone but their\nMasters. Gloria--golden flesh; warm and human love of Kelsey; love in\na transparent gown tight and clinging to the flesh; warm and waiting\nlove. Love-kissing and kissing--but Alice tried not to look at love.\n\nSome time ago, she had liked looking at love, but now she felt fear,\nfear of love-kissing. She felt an intense hunger that had elements of\nterror blended with elements of awakening as she looked at it, trying\nnot to look or feel any connection with it.\n\nBut she felt the desire, growing from evening to evening as she\nremembered or looked at, Kelsey and his love-loving and hugging and\nkissing--the desire to hold him, to feel him her own, so as never to\nlet him leave, never let him escape, never let herself be taken from\nhim and rebuilt and lost. And that was the cause of the desire, making\nit agonizingly stronger. And the sight of it--the sight and sound of\nthe loving, the kisses, the motions of loving--were more and more\nunbearable.\n\nGloria was beautiful, so beautiful. She was slim and warm and tall and\ncurved and human.\n\nBut Alice had to look just the same, as though there was some last\njustification in looking because it could never happen to Alice,\nbecause they were human and she was not.\n\nThey were sitting tightly entwined about one another on the couch.\n\n\"We ought to get a roommate permit real fast,\" Kelsey said in a whisper.\n\n\"But it hasn't been two weeks yet since the office party,\" Gloria said.\n\nThat was where they had met and knew it was love, at the office party.\n\n\"But maybe if we asked--\" Kelsey said.\n\n\"But we shouldn't rush it honey. It wouldn't be _sincere_!\"\n\n\"Yes, that's true,\" Kelsey said. \"What would people think?\"\n\nAnd then, as Alice watched, they seemed to draw slowly apart as though\nthe face, the color, the sound and voices from the Tevee was throwing\nan invisible wall between them. They were staring at the Tevee longer\nand longer and finally they weren't looking at one another at all.\n\nThere were always a number of people present inside the Tevee frame.\nIf one person was talking, the background was full of people--people\nmoving, dancing, walking, but there just the same, always.\n\nThe woman was smiling intensely out of the screen. \"Don't be left\nout,\" she said. \"Be a solid member of your group. You can own a\nSky-Splitter jet sporter now without offending your crowd. Our special\nconsumer's research proves that now at last these amazing Sky-Splitters\nare no longer _conspicuous_ items, but are fully _accepted_ as _normal_\nby over ninety-three per cent of the consumer public. You can enjoy\nthe cloud thrills of a Sky-Splitter without being considered in any\nway _eccentric_. Press your Interest or Order button now! An immediate\ndemonstration will be arranged!\"\n\nDancers swirled. A Sky-Splitter jet dissolved from clouds. It was as\nif a dream had become abruptly real. Surrounded by people laughing and\naccepting one another, the sleek projectile gave the warmest impression\nof itself being organic and one of the happy, happy crowd.\n\nKelsey jerked forward and jabbed the I-Am-Interested button.\n\n\"I don't care,\" Gloria pouted. \"I'd still feel kind of--well--like I\nwas showing off if I had a Sky-Splitter.\"\n\n\"But now everybody will have one,\" Kelsey said.\n\nAlice wondered when they were _really_ going to make love. Like the\nlovers were always never quite doing on Tevee. But Alice decided she\nwould never look at that. It would hurt too much.\n\n\n\nAnother self-improvement commercial. This time a man with a ballet in\nthe background.\n\n\"Are you in tune with your crowd? If you do not feel that your tastes\nare in perfect accord with the tastes of your group, send for the\nReacto Tester. This mechanical device, when attached to the brain,\nrecords accurate tastes. It insures comforting conformity, and protects\nyou against the anxieties of conspicuousness. Remember, you can't stray\nfrom the norm with a Reacto.\"\n\nKelsey and his love had moved apart now. They were staring at the\nTevee. Everything the Tevee had to say seemed to involve getting along\nwith people, being loved, being liked, being accepted, not being\nrejected, not offending, how to love efficiently, how to be loved\ngracefully--\n\nBut there they are, the two of them, Alice thought. What are they\nwaiting for?\n\nWaiting to look just right, to smile just right. It was a matter of\nappearance. No one knew that better than Alice did who looked all\nwrong and could never look any different, never look human, never look\nfull of love.\n\nYou smiled when you loved. You smiled and your flesh turned warm. If\nyou had flesh. If your warmth was not a dial to be turned up or down.\nIf on the outside you were human so that everyone could know.\n\n\"Oh, Alice,\" Kelsey called out.\n\nAlice came in from the kitchen. \"Yes, Master Kelsey.\"\n\nGloria stared on and on into the Tevee while its color flickered over\nher half sleeping face.\n\n\"Tomorrow's your rest day, Alice.\"\n\n\"Yes, Master Kelsey.\"\n\n\"Well, you can go stand in your closet now. That will give you all\nnight and all day tomorrow to rest. Is everything taken care of around\nthe place for Tuesday?\"\n\n\"Yes, Master Kelsey.\"\n\nKelsey smiled at Alice. He whispered low, \"She likes me a little more,\ndon't you think so, Alice?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe smiled more widely. \"Well, Alice, good night. Relax your thermostat.\"\n\nKelsey laughed as she bowed slightly and walked out onto the porch and\nopened the door of her closet and got inside and stood there, the four\nwalls almost touching her when the door closed and she stood alone in\nthe loneliness of her darkness and silence.\n\nFor a long time it had been a rich darkness filled with an ever growing\nunderstanding of herself in a world alone, in a darkness all her own,\nwhere there could never be others of her kind, and lonely darkness was\nher only friend.\n\nBut it was different now. Love made the loneliness unbearable. Love\nturned lonely darkness to stabbing pain. Now it seemed like death.\nNo, death was nothing. This was worse than death. This was not being,\nunbeing. A being that was not a being, but something never able to\nbreak from its shell, staying shut up forever in its mechanical\nconfines.\n\nThey did not give me life, she thought. They sat me down before\nthe world's stage to watch without being able to understand. Now I\nunderstand, but I cannot live.\n\nShe clenched her hands and trembled in the dark, and felt the\nquickening beat of the things that made her run.\n\nIn the dark, the suffocating dark now that she knew what it could mean\nto really be alive and not one of the walking dead. In the dark, alone,\ndreaming of Kelsey, dreaming of human heart touching human heart, of\nthe lips of his kiss, of his arms around her neck; longing for the face\nof Kelsey next to her own in darkness lit by love, to take his mouth,\nto cover his body with kisses, to clasp his neck in her hands--\n\nAnd there alone where she had dreamed a thousand dreams, she knew she\ncould no longer merely dream. Dreams were not enough.\n\n_Not enough! Not enough!_\n\nA silent scream shrieked inside the narrow closet and cut the dark to\ntatters, and she ran out, out into the back yard of Kelsey's house and\nstood under the open sky.\n\nShe had the order blank, the paper, in her hand. A thing stolen, the\nresult of an act no robot could be guilty of because no robot had a\nsoul.\n\nBut I have a soul. There is a point at which the soul is sick. At this\npoint one awakens--awakens or dies.\n\n\n\nClutching the paper she had stolen from her love, she ran toward the\nCommutor jet station. Nowhere was there a light; not even from the city\nten miles from the housing project in which Kelsey lived. But Alice had\nno thought whatever of an air-raid. There were worse darknesses than a\nblackout. There were worse ways to die than under a rain of white fire\nbombs.\n\nThe fear of the bombs was the fear of never having lived, not a fear of\ndying.\n\nThe fear was over. There was only hope. The commitment was made.\nNothing could be worse than the way it had been, and failure could be\nonly a final admission of a defeat that had been there all the time.\n\nShe got off the Commutor Jet at the uptown station and walked through\ndarkness. She walked alone in the city. No human being would have been\nwalking in the darkness. They were hovering together behind blacked-out\nwindows in groups. But she felt nothing as she walked in the blackness.\n\nShe knew where the Clinic was. The address was on the order blank.\n\nShe hurried faster and faster. At no moment in her life had she felt\ndawning in her such a hope of happiness, such a feeling of ecstasy.\nAt no time, even in her deepest dreams, had she dreamed that she might\nreally be loved by Master Kelsey.\n\nIt was such a daring scheme that she even hesitated to think about it,\nafraid it might be merely a projection of a dream.\n\nIn black print at the top of the Order Blank were the words:\n\n                            FIX ME PLEASE!\n                         _Make me beautiful!_\n                        MAKE ME PLEASANT TO THE\n                        CUSTOMERS, AND A LOVELY\n                          ROBOT TO REMEMBER!\n\nAlice was a domestic. She was not supposed to carry that order to the\nClinic and be fixed up. The order blank was strictly for specialized\nreceptionist robots, office workers, robots that had to have a\ndifferent sort of front to meet the consumer public. Originally, all\nrobots had been made to look alike. But now, for psychological reasons,\nit had been decided to change the outward appearance of receptionists\nand other robots that met the general public.\n\nThey had to be lovely to look at, and be able to smile in the most\npleasant way possible.\n\nLaboring robots, domestics, their form was more functional than\nbeautiful. It lacked the surface polish of the office-working robots.\nAnd yet Alice knew that one of the beautiful receptionist robots for\nexample was indeed beautiful, and that it was almost impossible to\ndistinguish them from beautiful human beings.\n\nIt was daring and risky enough to be going to the clinic to pretend\nshe was a receptionist from Kelsey's office, there to be beautified.\nIt was a lot more risky and daring to have the idea that she might be\nbeautiful enough to pass herself off, at least for a little while, as a\nhuman being!\n\nBut she had one big advantage. They would never suspect her. They had\nno idea, she was sure of that, that any robot could act of her own free\nwill, and steal an order blank, and pretend to be something she was not\nin order to be made beautiful.\n\nA receptionist robot looked just like a beautiful human woman. She only\nacted like a robot. But if I looked like that, so beautiful, I could\nfeel human too. I could _be_ human.\n\nKelsey could give back my love to me, and our hearts would kiss and\nloneliness would die.\n\nThis was Monday. Tomorrow was her rest day. She wouldn't be missed as\nAlice the domestic until Wednesday morning.\n\nShe didn't want to think about what might happen after that. There\nwould have to be something happen when Alice the domestic was reported\nmissing. But then she was running way ahead of herself. It was still\nonly a hope that her scheme would work the way she had to dream that it\nwould.\n\nShe went in out of the dark into the Clinic building. The receptionist\nbehind the shiny chrome desk in the outer office hardly looked at Alice\nat all. Alice looked at her though. It was impossible to tell whether\nthe receptionist was human or not. But she was beautiful. As beautiful\nas Gloria Tonnencourt.\n\nA sign on the wall behind the receptionist said:\n\nBEAUTY IS AS BEAUTY DOES\n\nThe order blank was stamped with a number and Alice was told to wait.\n\nSitting there, waiting, she felt as though something steel-edged had\nsmashed into her chest. She felt cold, and adjusted her thermostat\nslightly. The steely sensation increased. Her hands were clenched. She\nfelt something inside of her pounding and pounding.\n\nI can tell you all my thoughts at last now, Master Kelsey, darling\ndarling Kelsey. I can tell you all the hopes without achievement, all\nabout the endless dark hours alone--\n\nHer number was called and she went in through a door that seemed to\nlead into an endlessly narrowing white funnel lined with shiny doors.\n\n\n\nThe room of hope was a square white box filled with shiny chrome\ncabinets. In the center was a table on little silent rubber wheels,\nwith a lamp looking down upon it like a gigantic unblinking eye.\n\nA slight willowy man gushed at her and gripped her arms with\nexuberance, and covered her over with the moist film of his bright and\neager eyes.\n\nHis voice was high and shrill. \"So you want to be beautiful, lovely to\nlook at?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You shall be, my dear. Lie down please, lie down and trust me. You\nwill have to trust me, of course. Simply have to trust me just the\nsame.\"\n\n\"Will I be really beautiful--like the receptionist in the outer office?\"\n\n\"Ha, ha, my dear!\" He was pushing and pulling and finally she was lying\ndown and staring at the whirling lines of the white ceiling and seeing\nKelsey's smiling waiting yearning face in it. \"That is a joke, a very\nfunny joke. The receptionist out there is a human being. At least she\nwould lead the unsuspecting to believe that she is. However, I must\nconfess, my dear, that I have learned the sad truth that she is human\nin name only, that her heart is ice, and she is bitter with ambition.\"\n\n\"But she is so beautiful.\"\n\n\"Ah, but beauty is as beauty does, my dear. Or as beauty thinks.\nAnd sweet little ambitious Della in the outer office does not think\nlovely thoughts. Not at all, believe me. I have learned that from sad\nexperience.\"\n\nHis hands hovered over her eagerly, fluidly, as though there were no\nbones in them.\n\n\"I want to be as beautiful as possible.\"\n\n\"You are fortunate in having been sent to Julian. I promise that under\nmy touch you shall blossom into radiant beauty, the essence of feminine\nloveliness. You will be simply devastating.\"\n\nHe placed the tips of his long white fingers together and studied her\nwith his head angled like a bird's. \"A brunette, I think--\"\n\n\"I'd rather be a blonde.\"\n\n\"Oh, you would, would you, my dear! You seem extraordinarily concerned\nfor a robot.\" He stepped back and studied her curiously and the black\neyes sharpened like narrowing beams of black searching light.\n\n\"You know,\" he said softly, \"I studied in the greatest Salons of the\ncontinent to beautify women. Now I specialize in beautifying robots.\nWhy? Simple but paradoxical, but not as paradoxical as it might seem. I\ncan make a robot lovelier than a human.\"\n\n\"Lovelier than a human being!\"\n\n\"Exactly. Much lovelier. Beauty comes from within as the sages say.\nIt comes from the heart and the soul, my dear. And so few humans any\nlonger have either heart or soul. Of course, that would imply that\nrobots do have hearts and souls, so please, my dear, do not repeat what\nI have said. Already I am thought to be excessively eccentric for this\nsad conformistic age of orthodoxy and stupid unimaginative dependency.\nBeauty comes from individuality and strength, my dear. It comes from\nsadness and the ability to admit a sense of tragedy. Ah--but it is\nsad for me, for Julian, my dear. That my fulfillment comes only from\nadding a sense of life to humanoids. And looking at you--the likes of\nyou--sometimes I wonder if you--\"\n\nHis voice trailed off like smoke and he shrugged and waved his hands in\nthe air. \"So you want to be a blonde. Why a blonde?\"\n\n\"A tall blonde,\" she said, \"with lots and lots of sex appeal.\"\n\nHe kissed the tips of his fingers and rolled his eyes. \"Your wish shall\nbe granted. I, Julian, will outdo myself.\" He leaned over her. His\nvoice was low. \"Why is it that a robot can be made more beautiful than\na human? Tell me, my dear, tell me and I shall never tell anyone else.\nDo you have a soul? Do you have a heart? Do you know what it is to be\nsad and alone and can you find some pleasure in it? Do you perhaps even\nfind pleasure in yourself, and sometimes find it unnecessary to swim in\na sea of humanity like a brainless protozoon?\"\n\n\"But will I feel real, the way a human feels?\"\n\nHe straightened up slowly. He touched his forehead, where beads of\nsweat were forming, and slowly he licked his thin red lips.\n\n\"My, my, but you are an inquisitive robot! Why does it mean so much?\"\n\n\"Tell me, will I feel like the real thing? Flesh--when you touch\nflesh--\"\n\nHis hands moved over her. He bent above her. A cabinet slid open.\nShe caught the glint of many different colors of eyeballs looking\nstartlingly real and liquidly alive, and rows of variously sized\nbreasts, and lips, and muscle paddings, and eyelashes and eyebrows and\nears and noses and fingers. There were gleaming instruments and jars\nand plastic tapes.\n\nHis face was close above hers and his lips worked nervously. He\nwhispered, \"I can see how it will be, my dear. You will feel so real to\nthe touch of a hungry love that I shall be broken-hearted to let you\ngo from my Pygmalion Palace of dreams come true. My dear, believe me.\nBelieve Julian when he tells you this--there is no lonelier being in\nthe world than a man who has not forgotten what beauty is in a world\nthat has turned ugly from having lost its soul.\"\n\nThen she knew that Julian had turned off her thermostat. Suddenly there\nwas no feeling, no sound, no sight except that of the general blackout\nrushing in out of the night, down the halls, into the rooms, into her\neyes.\n\nHow quickly and painlessly a robot could die, she thought. How easy it\nwas to live and die and come back to life. You could be born suddenly\nfull-grown and efficient. You could be blotted out again, just as\nsuddenly. You could be born in any shape or size, born to do any one\nor combination of so many different things, and when your job was done\nyou could so quickly be put to rest again. You could be born ugly, or\nround, or square, or like a pyramid, or something almost all arms, or\nlegs, or eyes, or ears.\n\nYou could be born beautiful, hardly distinguishable from a beautiful\nhuman being who could receive love.\n\nYou could be born ugly and then be killed and brought back again as\nbeautiful as a human being.\n\nBut you could not live without love.\n\nCould something be returned that no one knew was there?\n\n\n\nShe stood before the mirror, hardly daring to breathe.\n\n\"Oh God,\" Julian whispered. He stood in a corner of the room, and his\neyes were narrowed and his hands were gripped together. \"I knew I was\na genius. But this--this is something else! What have I done? Statues\nturned to living beauty. What in the name of God is this?\"\n\n\"I'm beautiful,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" he said thickly. \"Yes--\"\n\n\"As beautiful as Gloria.\"\n\n\"Whoever she is, yes, yes--\"\n\n\"He will love me.\"\n\n\"I love you, my dear, I love you,\" he whispered again and again.\n\nA great calm came over her. A great calm and a great chill. She felt\nuneasy because she felt so wonderful, too wonderful, too uneasy, as if\nshe might feel too deeply and something inside would break.\n\nShe felt Julian's hand on her and he was turning her around. \"I must\nkiss you,\" he said. \"I must kiss you. I love you.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she smiled. \"You may kiss me.\"\n\nShe imagined it was Kelsey kissing her. Kelsey's arms were around her\nneck, and she was longing for the face of Kelsey. She moved her lips\nover his forehead and his cheeks until she felt the moistness of his\nmouth. She saw the unsettled look in Julian's face and the sweat on his\nupper lip. It was her first kiss, and it was Kelsey she kissed.\n\nJulian stepped back and touched his lips. He shook his head and jerked\nhis face nervously toward the door.\n\nHe stared into her eyes. His fingers ran over her face. \"Now I see\nit,\" he whispered hoarsely. \"Now I see it. It was there before, before\nI ever touched you. It was in your eyes. I've always known that. I've\nknown that no one creates beauty out of pastes and tape and foam rubber\nand false hair.\"\n\n\"I must go now,\" she said. \"I must hurry.\"\n\n\"That's right, that's very right. You've got to go out of here, out of\nmy sight and out of my mind!\"\n\n\"Do I feel real?\"\n\n\"My God! There's this light--that is what you feel--the light! Listen,\nlisten to me whoever, whatever, you are. Listen. What's happening?\nYou're more real than the woman who invites me to her apartment and\nassures me with insipid smiles and phony gestures that she is real.\nWhat's real? You're real--but you can't be real!\"\n\nHe turned away from her and leaned against the wall. There was a catch\nin his voice, and she could see the throbbing in the side of his neck.\n\"You had better go now. And tomorrow I won't remember you. I'm probably\ngoing crazy. Beginning to believe in my own pitiful wishes. Everyone\nI know--all of them--shells of phony beauty, something painted on,\nsomething stuck on the outside. Nothing real, nothing real at all. And\nwhat do I do--dream? Dream of somehow bringing real beauty back. But it\nnever comes back! Beauty comes from inside. I cannot paste it onto the\noutside of a hollow shell and make beauty come alive!\"\n\n\"Julian--\"\n\nHe blinked at her, as though startled and afraid. \"What has happened\nwith you? How many like you are there? No, I can't start believing such\nan incredible thing. I'd be lost. Get out! Get out!\"\n\nShe touched his shoulder. \"Goodbye,\" she said softly. \"I know what\nloneliness is.\"\n\nWhen he turned to her again there were tears in his eyes. He whispered,\n\"I believe you do--you really do. But how could it be? How could you\nhave inside of you what we humans are losing?\"\n\nShe sat in the Commutor Jet, returning to Master Kelsey. She knew that\nlooking like a beautiful woman was not quite enough. She had to know\nthe right things to say. She felt that she did know all the correct\nretorts, quips, the polite gestures and nuances and intonations that\nmade one innocuously acceptable. She had watched the Tevee for years\nas they explained how to win people and influence the right friends,\nand gain the maximum amount of response from the group, from love, from\nwhoever was joining their smile with yours.\n\nShe had learned all the controversial things that must never be talked\nabout, and all the popular immediate things that should be talked\nabout incessantly. But she felt an intense need for rehearsal. This\nhad to be successful. She had committed herself. She could not fail.\nFailure meant a return to the factory and the final fatal twist of\nthe thermostat. It would not be murder, for they were ignorant of the\nexistence of a robot's soul. And she didn't care about the risk. She\nwould feel her love for Kelsey returned; she would feel his arms,\nhis lips, his love. Let them, whoever they were, worry about the\ndisappearance of a drab domestic named Alice.\n\nAlice was dead. Alice had been reborn. Alice had come out of the lonely\ndark of unborn waste into the living light of love.\n\nShe carried on this imagined conversation with Kelsey, rehearsing.\nNo, it was not enough to be filled to overflowing with love. You had\nto know how to act, you had to smile all the time, you had to say the\nright things and know when not to speak. Beauty is as beauty does.\n\n\"Well,\" the imaginary Kelsey said, smiling, \"do you like Arnso's new\nhit recording, I'LL ALWAYS WANT YOU, as much as the one he recorded\nlast week?\"\n\n\"It's wonderful,\" she said, smiling. \"The sweetest thing since WE'LL\nALWAYS BE TOGETHER, NO MATTER WHAT. Which reminds me, honey. I'm going\nto buy one of those new Snap-Grav-Share-The-Fall suits. Don't you think\nthey would be fun?\"\n\n\"Lots of fun,\" the imaginary Kelsey said smiling. \"Six people instead\nof three can share it. The more the merrier.\"\n\n\n\nIn her mind, the imaginary Kelsey hesitated, then said, \"What Quik-Pik\nbook are you reading right now?\"\n\n\"Which one are _you_ reading, honey?\" she evaded.\n\nYou never read anything everyone else wasn't reading; she knew that\nmuch.\n\n\"Well, I like MY DAY AT THE OFFICE. It shows how a woman gets through\na day with her fellow workers in her office, how she smiles and is\npleasant and well-liked and never loses her temper. It shows all the\nlittle tricks you can pull that help you sell yourself.\"\n\n\"That sounds like a wonderful book, honey. I'll get it at once!\"\n\nIt sounded right. But there was something wrong. It was the right thing\nto talk about, but it wasn't what she would prefer to talk about if she\nwere alone with Kelsey. Feeling the way she felt, she didn't think she\nwould want to talk much at all if she were alone with Kelsey.\n\nBut she knew that was a real social taboo--not saying anything at all.\n\nAnyway, she gave herself a Gold Star for being so sociable with the\nimaginary Kelsey. She was sure, very sure, she could sell herself to\nKelsey.\n\nOnly she would have to have another name. Two names. Human names.\nSomething that sounded beautiful.\n\nAnita. Anita Starre.\n\nShe would knock on Master Kelsey's door and ask him for someone's\naddress. He was so nice and considerate he would surely ask her in for\na drink, or just ask her in, while he gave her directions.\n\nDry leaves crackled under her as she walked the half-block toward\nKelsey's house. The night was black with a few cold stars in the\nendless vault of sky. It was late, but in almost all the houses you\ncould see the gentle glow of Tevee color through the windows.\n\nThere was no sound at all where the houses of the project, all looking\nexactly the same, dwindled away into darkness like lines of dots made\nby a typewriter.\n\nIt was, she thought, as though everyone and everything in the world\nwere waiting, waiting for the great white hot scream to explode in\nthe night, the great awakening, the blinding hot flash of awakening\nthat comes before the end. But Alice didn't feel afraid at all of an\nair-raid as she walked up onto Master Kelsey's porch and rang the bell.\nThere had been so many false alarms, she wondered sometimes if there\nwas any real threat at all. The war--a vague thing far away, never\nhere, always somewhere else, but always supposed to be getting nearer.\nThe war with the Asians--it just went on and on, you heard about it,\nand saw it on Tevee if you weren't afraid to look at the newscasts, but\nit never seemed to happen here.\n\nHis footsteps behind the door. The door opening. His shadow there, the\npink lounge suit, the wavy hair with streaks of brown in the Viking\nyellow, the face sleepy from Tevee coming awake as he saw the beautiful\nwoman standing there smiling. He smiled. Their smiles met.\n\n\"Hello,\" she said. \"I'm Anita Starre. I'm looking for 16-03074 Carnegie\nWay.\"\n\n\"You're lost?\"\n\n\"I seem to be lost, yes.\"\n\nThe great hope dawned in her as he smiled at her in a way no robot had\never been smiled at. A tender calm moved over her. The machinery that\nmade her go, the sparks that made her live, all seemed to jump and\ntremble under the beautiful shell that had been created by the hands of\nJulian.\n\nThe great joy filled her, surged inside her. She could be near, so near\nhim, now that she had the right look and the right smile. She could\ntell him and show him how she loved to be near him--No, she would not\nhave to tell him that; he would know. Real love you just knew about.\nYou didn't have to say it. She would just kiss him and kiss him and\nnever have to tell him--\n\n\"This is Carnegie Way,\" Kelsey was saying. His eyes were fixed on her\nface, then his eyes were brightening as they looked at her height and\nher slim rich curves. \"But it's five blocks from the address you're\nlooking for.\" He pointed to the left and told her how to get to\n16-03074. His eyes continued to explore her figure with just the right\ndegree of polite interest.\n\nShe stepped closer until she was almost inside the hallway. She could\nfeel the warmth of him. \"Why,\" she said suddenly, \"you're Mr. Kelsey!\"\n\nHis smile broadened with some hungry concept of himself that had been\nfed. \"But how did you know, Miss Starre?\"\n\n\"A girl friend of mine, Miss Davies, works in your office.\"\n\n\"Oh, Miss Davies! She got a Silver Star--\"\n\n\"Yes, she admires you so much. She has a picture of you, Mr. Kelsey.\nShe told me how you won a Golden Star for being so cooperative.\"\n\n\"We all help one another. Miss Davies is such a wonderfully warm and\nsympathetic girl. Well, Miss Starre, what a coincidence!\"\n\n\"Isn't it?\"\n\n\"Well--maybe you could come in and rest a few minutes. We're watching\nTevee.\"\n\nShe nodded quickly. She felt that magnetic force, the clicking\ncommunion, the way she had always seen it on Tevee. How easy it was,\nafter all, if you looked right and smiled right and said the correct\nthings.\n\n\"Oh, I'd love to!\"\n\n\n\nMiss Gloria Tonnencourt stood up, and the three of them seemed subdued\nand softened in the Tevee light. Kelsey said, \"Gloria, this is a friend\nof mine, a really dear friend, Anita Starre.\"\n\nThere was something wrong. It was under the surface, Alice thought,\nbut it was there. Under the smiles, something tense and wrong and\ndangerous. She had never felt it before, but she felt it now. It was\nGloria, the way the smile seemed set on Gloria's face as she said she\nwas very pleased to meet Miss Starre. It had always been there, that\nsmile, so it couldn't go away, but Alice knew that if she were Miss\nTonnencourt she would not feel like smiling. No one could smile, she\nthought, if they were losing their love. Real love you could die of\nlosing.\n\nThey all smiled at one another. Kelsey got three drinks and they drank\nto one another's happiness as though there was no question that there\ncould be anything else in the world but happiness.\n\nGloria has to do what's right, Alice thought. No matter how painful,\nshe has to do what's right. I'm lucky because she has to do what's\nright, because she always has to be a good sport about everything.\n\nThey chatted together like good sports for a while, talked about the\npop tune of the week, the favorite sports hero of the day, the best\nQuik-Pik book of the hour, the Sky-Splitter, the Roaromatic Roadeater,\nthe Silver and Golden Stars for cooperation, the Blue Stars for\ncommunal feeling. The Carnegie Awards for sociability.\n\nThey have to get along, Alice thought gladly. They have to get along.\nThey can't afford to offend one another.\n\nGloria finally got up, seeming tired in spite of her smile, and said,\n\"I'd better be going now. I--I can see that you two have a real thing\nfor one another already. I--I think it's just--wonderful--so wonderful,\nreally--\"\n\nKelsey didn't seem to hear Gloria at all, hardly seemed to know she was\nthere. He kept looking at Alice. \"Please don't go, Gloria,\" he said as\nhe kept on looking at Alice.\n\n\"It's awfully sweet of you to ask me to stay, but I really must go now.\nIt's--it's getting late.\"\n\nI know how you really feel, Alice thought. I know, I know, somewhere\ndeep inside you feel an awful sickness like death, but on the outside\nyou smile. I know how you feel.\n\nBut do you know how you feel anymore, Gloria? Can you feel the way you\nreally feel? What would happen if--\n\nBut no matter how Gloria felt, no Mirror on a wall could have been\ncritical of her appearance, her poise, her polite good-sport way of\nbowing out.\n\nGloria moved toward the door. Kelsey hurried over there and opened it\nfor her. \"You two be happy,\" Gloria whispered. \"You two seem to be\nso--so very right for an anther.\"\n\nThe door shut. It was as though Gloria Tonnencourt had never been there.\n\nHow could it be so easy? Alice's hand trembled as Kelsey moved toward\nher. With Gloria it had been so quick, happening so fast, over so\neasily.\n\n\"Regular girl,\" Kelsey was saying. \"What wonderful warmth and\nunderstanding.\"\n\n\"She's sweet,\" Alice heard herself saying. But that wasn't true.\nShe only felt that Gloria had been sad. If it had been sweet it was\nbitter-sweet sadness. But Alice had to forget about Gloria. Gloria was\ngone. It was like she had never been here at all, as though all those\nevenings of love had never been. Switch it on, switch it off. It was\nlike Tevee, she thought, like Tevee--\n\nKelsey asked her to sit down on the couch, and then he was sitting near\nher, nearer to her. Then he was touching her, his face inches from hers.\n\n\"It seems I've known you for years and years,\" he said.\n\nAnd then she was forgetting everything else but Kelsey. It was easy,\nso easy when you looked and felt right. So easy and she didn't want to\nthink about anything else but Kelsey, dear, sweet, darling Kelsey.\n\nShe received him in her arms, with a wild desire, a wild hunger to\ncover his face with kisses. She felt the intensity taking hold of her,\ngripping her body, quickening the pounding throb of machinery that was\nhidden now, hidden away deep and silent and beating now like a human\nheart.\n\nShe kissed his cheek. Her lips strayed over his skin. Her lips glided\nover his face, felt the moist trembling of his lips.\n\nShe felt his trembling, his shuddering sigh, the way his arms convulsed\nand gripped her, and then she saw the unsettled look, the light in his\neyes as he clung to her and at the same time seemed to push her away.\n\nHe was frightened. He was trembling, and he was afraid, and his face\nwas flushed.\n\n\"What's the matter, darling?\" she whispered.\n\n\n\nHe stared at her. His lips were trembling. \"I--I don't know. What is\nit? It was never like this.\"\n\n\"What was never like this?\"\n\n\"Love--I mean--you--what is it?\"\n\n\"Real. It's real, darling Kelsey. That's the difference, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Real?\" His face had an uncomprehending look, the cheek muscles\ntrembling as he spoke, his voice hollow and frightened. \"Something,\" he\nwhispered. \"What is it? I've never felt anything like it. It--it's too\nmuch, maybe. Too much or something--I don't know--\"\n\nHis face was white. He was sliding away from her.\n\nAlready I am losing him, she thought. He's going away. Somehow he\nsenses what is wrong, without knowing what it is he knows. In spite of\nthe beautiful surface, he senses that I am not real, not human, not a\nbeing at all.\n\n\"No, please,\" she whispered.\n\nShe moved desperately and clutched at him and held him tightly, shocked\nat his stiffness now, his reluctance, his trembling. She felt tears\ninside, though they could never show. \"Please, please,\" she whispered.\n\nHis voice was shaking. \"Listen--it's too much. You scare me. Wait a\nminute now, let's talk about this. I want to know--\"\n\n\"How can you be scared of love?\"\n\n\"Love? This isn't love. It's--it's like anger. It's--I've never known\nanything like this!\"\n\n\"Let yourself know. Please.\"\n\nHe closed his eyes. His lips trembled. \"I--I felt like I was going to\ndie,\" he whispered.\n\nSuddenly he turned and stared at the Tevee.\n\nHe knows, she thought dully. He knows I'm what I am underneath. But he\ndoesn't know that he knows. He can't admit what seems impossible.\n\nHe gasped. His body jerked. She looked at the Tevee frame. There was\nnothing on it suddenly but a frightening, wavering, milky emptiness.\n\nAnd a voice; a voice without a face.\n\n\"Due to the possibility of an immediate air-raid, Tevee is dead.\nAll transportation is stopped. Those of you who were thoughtful\nand cooperative enough with your sponsor to order our emergency\nentertainment projectors will now turn them on. It will greatly\ndecrease anxiety. Red-out regulations will be in effect for two hours.\"\n\nKelsey's face was gray. \"Air-raid,\" he whispered. \"It's here. It's\nreally here!\"\n\n\"It's all right, darling.\" She touched his arm. \"It's all right--\"\n\nThe light went out.\n\nSomewhere Alice heard screaming. It seemed to fill the walls, the\nfloor, the ceiling and the night itself, everywhere, as though the very\nair was screaming in some vast agony. The sirens.\n\nShe heard a whimpering sound and realized that it was Kelsey. She held\nhim tightly in her arms. He was shivering.\n\nThe Tevee screen seemed like a page on which vital print had died,\nsomething strangely alive but without sound or meaning, like an\nexposed brain without thought, like the deadness of an open eye in a\ncorpse.\n\n\"All lights will be extinguished for two hours,\" the voice said.\n\"Everyone will go immediately to their air-raid shelters!\"\n\n\"Two hours,\" Kelsey whispered.\n\n\"I'm here,\" she said. \"We're together, darling. There's nothing--\"\n\nHe didn't seem to hear her. He leaped out of her arms, and she heard\nfurniture crashing as he blundered around wildly in the dark.\n\n\"The shelter,\" he yelled hoarsely. \"The shelter!\"\n\nShe followed him unerringly in the dark, to the stairs, without\nstumbling. When she found him at the bottom of the stairs in the\ntunnel leading to the private air-raid shelter, he was whimpering and\nshivering violently.\n\n\"Two hours--two hours--two hours--\" he whispered, over and over.\n\nShe could tell by the way he said it that it meant something else\nto him, not two hours, but something infinitely longer, unendurably\nlonger, some kind of awful forever.\n\nShe helped him into the shelter and closed the thick door. She couldn't\nunderstand that kind of loneliness. She had stood in the black lonely\ncloset for years. She had worked alone. She could understand the\nloneliness of being without love. But this fear of his--it had no\nmeaning for her.\n\nAnd as she looked at Kelsey cowering in the corner of the shelter, she\nrealized something else--Kelsey himself had very little meaning. He was\nnot what he had seemed. He was empty. He was hollow. He wasn't quite\nreal. That was what his fear was; a fear of discovering he had nothing\ninside; a horror of the absence of something you could create inside\nyourself only by being alone.\n\nAlice knew that now. Maybe she had always known it, but now she\nadmitted it to herself.\n\nThe shelter was a small square room lined with concrete and lead and\nsteel. There was a large supply of food, and a method of reprocessing\nthe air. A person could live in it for a long time. Alice knew she\ncould. She would have loved being there just with Kelsey, but Kelsey\nwas empty, and there was no way he could give her back her love,\nnothing in him he could use to share loneliness with her.\n\n\"Two hours--\"\n\n\"But I love you,\" she said weakly. \"We have one another. We can talk.\nWe can tell one another all about--\"\n\n\"No Tevee,\" Kelsey whispered. \"We can't get out! No one can get in! Two\nhours!\"\n\nThe screaming was in the shelter walls. It quivered in the floor\nand ceiling and walls. But there was really no sound. Nothing could\npenetrate here; no sound or light. Kelsey looked around the small\nenclosure. \"It may be longer--\"\n\n\"It's only a warning,\" Alice said. \"There may not be a real air-raid at\nall.\"\n\n\"Talk!\" he suddenly screamed at her. \"Let's talk! Talk to me--\"\n\nBut the superficial things slipped away and she couldn't remember\nany of them. She wanted to take him in her arms, but she couldn't do\nthat now because it wasn't real. She couldn't talk about all those\nmeaningless things. Maybe now nothing would be enough to satisfy\nKelsey's hollow fear.\n\n\n\nWith Gloria, with all of them, Alice knew that Kelsey had always been\nalone. More alone, more horribly alone, than she had ever been. For\nKelsey had nothing inside of him to keep him company, or to sincerely\nshare with another.\n\nHe had no love in him.\n\nShe tried to comfort him, but he was on his knees, shivering and\nwhimpering. Then he tried to beat his way out through the door. She\npulled him back and he fell sobbing on the floor, squirming and rubbing\nhis hands and his face into the floor as though to get some feeling of\nlife from it.\n\nThe trembling of the walls and floor continued, very gently as though\neven that was somehow being polite, as though even that was trying to\nmake things not so discomforting.\n\nKelsey was whining and sobbing. \"I've got to get out--get out. There's\na shelter--a communal shelter. The project place--people--lots of\npeople--\"\n\n\"All right,\" she said. \"Let's take a chance, if you want to. We'll go\nto that other shelter--with people in it.\"\n\nBut when they got to the top of the stairs and stepped into the living\nroom, the lights went on, the Tevee came to color-sound-life again.\n\nThe air-raid warning was over.\n\nA smiling face materialized out of the wavery lines.\n\n\"The threat of the air-raid is over. Due to our wonderful cooperative\nspirit, the enemy's cowardly attack accomplished little except the\nminor destruction of a few scattered points. We're sure now that anyone\nwho has not ordered our Cozy-Corner Air-Raid Shelter will do so without\nfurther delay! It comes equipped, remember, with three-dimensional\nTevee. There is the illusion of real people--\"\n\nOver fifty million air-raid shelters were sold within an hour.\n\nBut Alice wasn't concerned about that. She gave Kelsey a sedative\nand put him to bed, and then she went to her dark closet and stood\nin it until Wednesday morning. She had time to think about things,\nand a wonderful calm came over her, and she knew she didn't care what\nhappened to her now. She was strong enough to live alone, and take\nwhatever was coming to her without fear.\n\nWhen she shook Kelsey awake Wednesday morning and told him she was\nAlice, he laughed, shocked and incredulous, trying to appear amused.\nBut she told him about the order blank, and convinced him she really\nwas Alice and Anita Starre did not exist.\n\nHe ran and called a robot repair clinic. He was almost incoherent,\ntrying to tell the clinic what had happened, but they finally\nunderstood and said they would be right out to take the domestic away.\n\nHe seemed frightened as he looked at her.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" he said several times. \"No one told you to do\nsuch a thing. How could a robot just up and do such a thing?\"\n\nShe started to answer, but didn't. There was nothing to say.\n\n\"Robots can become inefficient,\" Kelsey said. \"They can wear down a\nlittle and have to be repaired. But how could a robot just up and do a\nthing like this?\"\n\nBecause of loneliness and the need for love? She smiled. She could\nsmile now. It would have been funny for her to have said such a thing\nas that.\n\nShe didn't care. She heard the jet-truck drop down by the curb outside\nKelsey's house. She heard the footsteps coming up the walk, onto the\nporch. But she didn't care. She was strong enough not to care at all.\n\nShe cared not at all for any of them, Master Kelsey included. She\ncared a little for Julian, for he had understood a little. But she\ndidn't care about any of the others now. They hardly existed! They had\nnothing! In them, everything had been frozen forever and nothing really\nmoved inside.\n\nThey were empty, they were nothing, they didn't exist!\n\nYou saw the bright surfaces and the smiles as they walked and talked on\nthe street, and for a while you wanted to believe they existed, that\nthey were there. But they weren't really there at all.\n\nShe smiled and stood still and waited for them to move toward her. They\nseemed afraid of her.\n\nThere's nothing to be afraid of, not here, not in me, she wanted to\nsay. It's in you that the fear is, for what is more frightening than\nemptiness and the feel of hollow time going by?\n\nAt least she had the joy of knowing she had been alive.\n\nThe hand turned off her thermostat.",
