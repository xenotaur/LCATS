    "body": "On his fortieth birthday Martin Sutter decided life was too short to\ncontinue in the rut that had been his existence for more than twenty\nyears. He withdrew his savings from the Explosion City Third Federal\nBank, stopped in a display room and informed a somewhat surprised clerk\nhe was taking the electric runabout with the blue bonnet. The\nground-car, complete with extras, retailed for a tidy three thousand\ncredits.\n\nTo accustom himself to the car's controls Sutter chose Highway 56 for a\ndriving lesson. He tooled the electric runabout up into the third level,\npurred out across state at an effortless two hundred, then descended via\na cloverleaf to ground tier and entered a maze of subsidiary roads that\nled through the summer countryside.\n\nIn this manner he drove the major part of the afternoon. Travel was\nlight, away from the elevated lanes and he enjoyed himself.\n\nAt four o'clock he began to look for a convenient place to turn around.\nIt was then that he sighted the roadside stand ahead. Above it a freshly\npainted sign read: TV SETS. LATEST MODELS. SPECIAL WHOLESALE PRICES!\n\nSutter smiled. Whoever heard of selling television sets on a country\nhighway? It was like--why, it was like selling eggs in the lobby of the\nHotel International! Then it occurred to him that his own TV set had not\nbeen in good working order for more than a year. The olfactory control\nhad jammed last week while he was watching a Sumatran tribal ceremony,\ninland from Soerabaja, and he had been unable to smell the backdrop\nfrangipani blossoms. It was time he bought a new set....\n\nSutter touched a stud and the electric runabout coasted to a halt. As he\nclimbed out of the car and walked across the highway toward the stand,\nhe thought for a moment there was something wrong with his contact\nlenses or perhaps his eyes.\n\nThe stand and the sign above it appeared to waver uncertainly, to become\ndisjointed as though viewed through uneven glass. But the effect passed\nand Sutter approached the stand and nodded to the individual tilted back\nin a chair beside it.\n\nHe was a rawboned man with a thatch of thick black hair and small watery\neyes. He was dressed, oddly enough, in a pair of tight-fitting trousers\nof white lawn, a flaming red tunic and a yellow cummerbund.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he said. \"Can I show you something in a new TV?\"\n\n\"Where are they?\" asked Sutter, surveying the empty stand.\n\n\"Out back,\" replied the man. \"Just a minute and I'll show you.\"\n\nHe rose lazily from his chair and led the way around to the rear of the\nstand. Sutter could have sworn he had seen an apple orchard behind the\nstructure as he rode up, but he must have been mistaken for now he saw a\nlow-roofed, aluminum-walled building there, huge doors open on one side.\nIt looked, he thought, somewhat like a hangar....\n\nTwo hours later Sutter arrived back at his home in town. He parked the\ncar, went around to the rear compartment, lifted out a large packing\ncase and carried it to his sitting room. There, with the aid of hammer\nand crowbar, he stripped away the protective boards and then trundled\nthe cabinet to an unoccupied corner.\n\nIt was certainly a unique TV set. A very new model, the salesman had\nsaid. The cabinet was shaped like a delta with a cube surmounted on the\npointed end of the triangle. The cube held the screen, the triangle, the\ncontrols. Finished in a subdued ochre color, the set captured the light\nof the dying day that filtered through the bay window and gleamed with a\nsoft radiance.\n\nSutter looked at the control panel and his smile of satisfaction faded\nsomewhat. It looked a little complicated....\n\nInstead of the usual knobs there were five small spoked wheels, each\nclosely calibrated in lavender with resilient studs that seemed to be\nmade of plush. Below this was a small dial with the legend _Element of\nProbability_ lettered on it.\n\nSutter was about to switch on the set when the door buzzer sounded. He\ncrossed to the door and pulled it open.\n\nA tall gangly man stood there. Swarthy, face partially covered by a\nneatly trimmed beard, he looked the conventional picture of a story-book\nvillain. He wore a broad-brimmed hat and an under-slung pipe was clamped\nin his teeth. He said in a deep booming voice, \"Are you Mr. Martin\nSutter?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am. What can I do for you?\"\n\nThe man said his name was Lucien Travail. He explained that he had been\nlooking for a room and that Mrs. Conworth, the landlady, had informed\nhim she had no vacancies but suggested that her roomer, Mr. Sutter,\nmight be interested in a roommate.\n\n\"Of course I realize you don't know me but I believe our strangeness\nwill be offset by our mutual hobby.\"\n\nSutter was silent, waiting for him to continue.\n\n\"I collect shells,\" Travail said.\n\nFor thirty years Sutter had pursued a hobby which had begun in his\nboyhood days during summer vacations at the seashore--the collecting of\nexoskeletons of mollusks and crustaceans. Long ago his assortment of\ncowries, spiny combs and yellow dragon-castles had outgrown their glass\ncabinet and overflowed into three carefully catalogued packing cases.\n\nTo Sutter, anyone who liked shells was a person above suspicion. Thus it\nwas that two days later, after a casual checking of the bearded man's\nreferences, he invited Travail to move in with him.\n\nDuring those two days Sutter tried unsuccessfully to put his new\ntelevision set into operation. But the set refused to work. Turn the\nqueer dials as he would, all he could get on the elliptical screen was a\nblur of blinding colors.\n\nOn the evening of the third day Travail looked up from his newspaper,\nsaid, \"It says here that the president of the Federal Union Congress is\ngoing to make a speech in New Paris. Will you tune him in?\"\n\nSutter frowned. \"I would,\" he said, \"but my set is out of order. I\nshould call a repair man, but I had hoped to get it regulated myself.\"\n\nTravail laid down his pipe. \"Out of order, eh?\" he said. \"I'm sort of\nhandy with gadgets. Let me take a look at it.\"\n\nHe walked across to the cabinet, turned it around and stood peering at\nthe complicated chassis. A small brass nameplate caught his eye:\n_Manufactured by the Tanganyika Company, Dodoma, Empire of Tanganyika,\nEast Africa. Under charter of the Atomic Commercial Enterprise\nCommission. Warning: Permit only an accredited employee of this company\nto touch wiring._\n\nTravail snorted. \"Accredited employee, my foot! I know as much about\nthese things as they do.\"\n\nHe went into the kitchen and returned with a screwdriver. While Sutter\nlooked on with apprehensive eyes, he began to tinker with the wiring.\nSuddenly there was a dull report and a flash of flame. Travail jerked\nhis arm back as a thin streamer of smoke and the smell of burning\ninsulation entered the room.\n\n\"You've broken it,\" said Sutter accusingly.\n\nBut his voice died abruptly as the screen flared into light and a low\nhum sounded behind the panel. An instant later the light became subdued\nand a streak of tawny yellow took form. The yellow slowly coalesced into\na sandy stretch of beach with long rolling swells washing up on it, to\nrecede in a smother of foam. Through the amplifier came the muted roar\nof the breakers and the low soughing of the wind.\n\n\"Well, we got something at any rate,\" Travail said. \"I wonder what it\nis.\"\n\nSutter stared, fascinated. The view of the beach seemed to come into\nsharper focus as he watched, and he saw now that it was an incredibly\nlonely scene, with the sea stretching away to a vanishing point and a\nstand of stunted spruce flanking the width of sand. But what caught his\neye and held him almost in a trance was the array of objects littering\nthe sand at the water's edge.\n\nThey were shells. Not the prosaic commonplace shells usually found on a\nNew England shore nor even the brighter colored, more intricately formed\nshells of tropic seas. These were shells he had never seen before, even\nin library collections. Alien and soft-hued and lovely shells that\ncaused his collector's heart to jump wildly. He saw a delicate\nstar-shaped thing that might have been fashioned of porcelain and\nenameled with the brush of the Mings. He saw spiral coverings from\nuncatalogued cephalopods, many chambered and many hued. He saw shells of\na thousand shapes and designs, all incredibly beautiful....\n\nSutter forgot everything else as he sat there staring at that\ncollector's paradise.\n\n\"I'll see if I can get something else,\" said Travail.\n\n\"No!\" said Sutter quickly. \"Don't touch it!\"\n\nHe continued to stare hungrily at the alien shells until suddenly the\nscene before him grew dim, then faded completely away.\n\nTravail laughed shortly. \"Somebody sold you a fluke. This set must be an\noff brand. Incidentally, isn't Tanganyika a colony governed by the\nFederal Union Congress?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is,\" replied Sutter. \"I don't understand this at all. There's\nno _Empire_ of Tanganyika.\"\n\n\n\nNext morning after breakfast Sutter announced that he was driving into\nthe country to visit a friend. There was no reason why he should not\nhave told his roommate the truth--that he was going to look up the man\nwho had sold him the TV set. No reason except for the odd fact that\nTravail had made no mention of the alien shells, and Sutter kept\nthinking that a shell collector would have been immediately aware of the\nrareness of them.\n\nOnce again Sutter drove out across state and down the highway where he\nhad seen the roadside stand. But when he reached the spot there was no\nsign of the stand. The big oak tree which had shaded it and the rail\nfence on the adjoining property were there. But no stand. As Sutter\nstared with perplexed eyes at the spot he saw something he had not\nnoticed before.\n\nAt the edge of the highway was a large granite boulder with a bronze\nplate fastened to its slanting surface. Sutter got out of the car,\napproached it and read:\n\n    _This property has been preserved as a State Park to commemorate the\n    first successful trial explosion of the Hydrogen Bomb which took\n    place on this site and marked the beginning of an era._\n\nIt seemed to Sutter as he stood there that the surrounding silence grew\nmore intense. Then he passed through a wide gateway and began to stride\nacross an evenly clipped lawn toward a grove of trees beyond. Halfway he\npaused and glanced absently at his watch. It was exactly twelve o'clock\nnoon.\n\nAnd abruptly the scene before him slipped out of plumb. The sky and the\nlawn seemed to alter positions, to rotate madly as in a vortex. The\nwhirling ceased and the next instant Sutter stood on the shore of a\nlonely sea with a tawny width of sand stretching out before him and the\nwaves washing up almost at his feet. Then he saw the shells....\n\nIt was the beach of the alien shells! There they lay, scattered about\nthe sand, hundreds, thousands of them, alien and delicate and lovely,\nexoskeletons the like of which he had never seen before. Their pastel\ncolors blended with one another to form a horizontal rainbow extending\ninto the measureless distance.\n\nAnd somehow, as Sutter walked among them, picking his way with care, the\nyears of his life seemed to slip away and he was a small boy at the\nseashore again, entranced with his first shell discovery. He could even\nhear his mother's voice calling \"Be careful, Martin! Don't go too far!\"\n\nHe walked on and on, slowly, uncertainly, until the beach and the sea\nbegan to waver like a heat mirage. And suddenly the shells and the water\nvanished and he was on the green grass again with the grove of trees\njust ahead. He turned, saw a white highway with his car parked on the\nshoulder.\n\nDazedly, Sutter walked back to the car....\n\nAll next morning he ruminated over his strange experience. Toward noon\nthe pieces of the puzzle began to fit slowly together in his mind. But\nthe partial answer at which he arrived seemed too fantastic for belief.\nCould it be possible that when he had stopped at the roadside stand he\nhad blundered, in some inexplicable way, into another dimension?\n\nSutter had a layman's knowledge of Einsteinian physics, and he knew that\nexperiments in Time were being made every day. Only last week he had\nread in the paper of an army officer who had reportedly Time-traveled\nsome twenty-two minutes. And a year ago the Belgian scientist, Delgar,\nclaimed to have entered a secondary world which he declared impinged on\nour own.\n\nAssuming all this to be true, then it could be that the Tanganyika\ntelevision set was a product manufactured in Future Time by a company\nthat, by Sutter's Time standards, didn't yet exist.\n\nThe following day saw Sutter begin an experiment of which he was rather\nproud. Travail had said that he had tried to tune in the noon news\nbroadcast yesterday on the TV and had turned the set on from twelve\no'clock until five minutes after. At a nearby appliance store Sutter\npurchased a clock control which would turn his television set on and off\nat any chosen time. He set the control for two o'clock, then managed to\nlure Travail out of the house for the afternoon by giving him an\ninvitation he'd received for a lecture on marine life at a local club.\nNext, he drove again to the H-bomb site and stood waiting in the\ngrass-like park, watch in hand.\n\nAt precisely two o'clock there came that queer staggering of earth and\nsky. The trees gave way to the stretch of sand; the waves,\nleaden-colored and cheerless, dotted with white caps rolled up on the\nlonely shore. As before Sutter felt that same exhilaration, that same\nreversal to the spirit of his youth. But despite his mental excitement\nhe maintained an awareness of the situation and a remembrance of why he\nhad come here.\n\nWhen he walked among the shells this time he carried a large basket with\nhim and he picked up shells and dropped them into the basket, selecting\nthose that were the most alien.\n\nIn due time the basket was filled to overflowing and Sutter stood still,\nwaiting. Once more the surrounding landscape underwent its change. After\nthe whirling had ceased and the initial feeling of vertigo had passed\nSutter carried the full basket back to the car and began the long drive\nhome.\n\nAs he drove he mused over what Travail would say when he saw these\nshells. Then on second thought, he decided not to show them to him.\nTravail was getting on his nerves. He had obviously lied about his\ninterest in shells. On discussing the subject with him Sutter found he\ndid not know the first thing about them. In fact, he regretted taking\nhim in as a roommate.\n\nHe was convinced that Travail's friendly good-fellowship attitude was\njust a pose, cloaking a so far mysterious motive. But it could be that\nTravail knew of the value of Sutter's shell collection. Yesterday a\nletter had come from the Federal Arts Museum offering five thousand\ncredits for the lot, and while he had made no mention of the amount,\nSutter had been foolish enough to tell Travail there had been an offer.\n\n\"Are you going to sell?\" Travail had asked.\n\n\"Certainly not. They're worth five times the price they offered.\"\n\n\"Are they really?\" said Travail. \"That makes my own collection seem\nworthless by comparison.\"\n\nOh, Travail could be clever all right! Why else had he made no comment\nabout the alien shells they both had seen on the television set, if he\ndid know something of the value of shells?\n\nArriving home, Sutter entered by the rear door and carried the basket of\nshells to his bedroom. There he took them out and one by one spread them\non the table. He drew a goose-necked lamp down close and from the table\ndrawer took out a powerful ato-magnifying glass. Then he selected one of\nthe larger shells and began to examine it.\n\n\n\nAfter a while he took a small keyhole saw which he kept for such\npurposes, and very carefully began to cut the shell into two equal\nportions. Once again he moved the ato-glass and began to study one of\nthe sections. But the lamp was not very powerful, and insufficient for\nthe tiny details. Sutter abruptly remembered the four-position lamp in\nthe sitting room. He took the shell and the ato-glass and went to the\nfront room, hoping that Travail was not there.\n\nTo his relief he found the sitting room deserted. The television set\nstood silent in a corner and as he passed it Sutter switched it on, then\ncrossed to the four-position lamp and turned it up full. For a second\ntime he peered through the ato-glass long and intently.\n\nThe bisected shell appeared to be a spinal univalve, resembling the\nfamiliar cephalopoda, _nautilus_, with thin septa dividing the many\nchambers.\n\nBehind him the Tanganyika TV swelled on, the screen presenting that same\nscene of the beach of shells. As it did so Sutter uttered a startled\nexclamation.\n\nUnder the magnifying glass the chambers in the bisected shell suddenly\nbecame more than outgrowths of marine organism. _They were rooms!_\nTessellated ceilings, microscopically mosaic inlaid floors, long\nsweeping staircases with graceful slender balustrades and tall almost\nIonic columns....\n\nHeart pounding, Sutter looked again.\n\nHe saw that it was actually the light from the television set that was\nilluminating the interior of the shell, lighting it with a strange\nradiance that seemed to extend outward from the shell in a steadily\nwidening cone. His hand touched this cone, and it possessed a curious\nsolidity.\n\nHe hadn't been mistaken. _There were rooms in that shell!_ Narrow\ncorridors with arched doorways opened off alcoves and galleries. One\nvaulted chamber had a kind of dais in the center of it. The entire inner\nstructure was fashioned of pastel-tinted walls which caught the light of\nthe TV and radiated it to every corner in a soft glow of effulgence.\n\nA magnetic lure swept over Sutter. He felt an overwhelming desire to\nstep into that cone of light....\n\nWhether the exoskeleton expanded to admit his entrance or whether his\nown figure magically dwindled he could not tell, but the next instant he\nfound himself in a fairy palace with all about him a world of silence.\n\nA long broad hallway stretched before him. At the far end a ramp angled\nupward to a higher level. Sutter walked forward slowly, aware in a vague\nway that he had entered another plane that was at once a microcosm and a\nmacrocosm. On the second level the way ahead divided. After a moment's\nhesitation he chose the left-hand passage, passing through a\nkeyhole-shaped archway into a broad amphitheater, empty of furnishings,\nwith a kind of terrace or gallery at the far end. Emerging upon that\ngallery, Sutter saw that he had reached the outer limit of the shell.\nThe edges of the wall before him were cut off, jagged and rough, where\nhis saw had done its work.\n\nHe was looking out upon the normal world that was his living room.\n\nHe stiffened as the door to the room opened and Lucien Travail entered.\nHe sat down before the center table and carefully, systematically began\ngoing through the contents of the table drawer. Startled, Sutter\nwatched from his strange vantage point. Travail had not noticed that the\ntelevision set was turned on, and the high-backed davenport apparently\nhid the cone of blue light from his view.\n\nHe took a sheet of paper from the drawer, began reading it. With a start\nSutter recognized his letter from the Federal Arts Museum.\n\nAnd as a wave of wrath swept over him, Sutter saw that the beach scene\non the television set was slowly fading away. Fear and a realization of\nhis strange position struck him. He turned and ran madly back across the\namphitheater, down the ramp and along the long hallway to the point\nwhere he had entered the shell. Even as he approached it the cone of\nblue light dimmed, wavered and was replaced by a wall of partial\nblackness.\n\nSutter sent his hands clawing desperately at that wall as it flickered\ntwice and momentarily became translucent again. He forced his body\nbetween folds of palpable darkness, slid into the vanishing blue cone.\nInstantly he found himself in his normal world, standing in the center\nof the sitting room. Travail looked up, startled.\n\n\"Hullo. Where did you come from?\" he said finally.\n\nSutter said, \"What are you doing in my drawer?\"\n\n\"I was looking for my tobacco pouch,\" Travail replied easily. \"I'm sure\nI left it here on the table last night. I thought the maid might have\nput it in the drawer.\"\n\nIn his bedroom Sutter wrapped each of the alien shells in a sheet of\nnewspaper and restored them to the basket. He placed the basket on the\ntop shelf of the closet, concealing it with a couple of old hats.\n\nHe didn't sleep well that night. His mind reviewed over and over his\nstrange experience. Toward morning he fell into a deep sleep and dreamed\na wild dream of walking down a broad highway, flanked on one side by an\nendless line of television sets and on the other by man-high hills of\nalien shells.\n\nHe had his breakfast at the little coffee shop around the corner. But\nhalfway back to his apartment he suddenly thought of Travail alone in\nthe house with his shells. He broke into a run and he was panting for\nbreath when he reached his door.\n\nThe basket of shells was still on the shelf, but the newspaper wrappings\nwere loosened, and the bisected shell was entirely free of covering. And\nhe had not left them that way last evening.\n\nHad atomic transmigration attempted to draw the shells back into the\nTime sphere to which they really belonged? Sutter was a logical man, and\neven as this thought came his mind rejected it. It must be Travail. He\nhad taken a sample shell from the basket and even now perhaps was\ndickering with the officials of the Federal Arts Museum on a price.\n\nSutter picked up the bisected shell and went into the sitting room. He\ncarefully placed the shell upon the table so that the light from the\ntelevision set would fall directly upon it. Then he sat down to wait.\n\nAs he waited he mentally viewed the material prospects of his discovery.\n\nIf the Federal Arts Museum had offered five thousand credits for his old\ncollection, they would surely double their price on these rarities. He\nsaw himself the recipient of a fat check, his name and picture in the\npapers, television interviews, lecture assignments, world fame ...\n\nAnd to think that Travail had the brazen nerve to believe he could cash\nin on his good fortune!\n\n\"Damned bearded coot!\" Sutter mumbled to himself. \"He must take me for\nan utter fool!\"\n\nFootsteps sounded and his bearded roommate entered the room. Was it\nfancy or did Sutter see in those grey eyes a gleam of mingled avarice\nand satisfaction?\n\n\"Have a cigar?\" said Travail casually.\n\nSutter shook his head. \"You know I don't smoke.\" He crossed the room,\nadjusted the controls of the television set and watched the familiar\nbeach scene come into sharper focus. As the sound of the washing waves\nboomed from the speaker, the cone of bluish light took form before the\nbisected shell. Sutter moved the shell slightly so that it lay at\ndirectly right angles to the panel of the TV set. Travail, drawing on\nhis cigar, watched him curiously.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" he asked at length.\n\n\"Little experiment. Stand over here and I'll show you. Here, in front of\nthis cone of light.\"\n\nTravail took the place indicated. His face was emotionless as he looked\nbeyond the light into the bisected shell.\n\n\"Now walk forward,\" commanded Sutter.\n\n\"I'll do nothing of the sort,\" said Travail, starting to back away.\n\"What are you up to anyway?\"\n\nSutter had no plan in mind beyond an overwhelming desire to put a bad\nfright into his roommate in payment for what he considered a monstrous\nact of duplicity. It would serve Travail right if, once he entered the\nsecondary plane of the shell, he would be forced to stay there a while.\nA good scare would cause him to leave, maybe.\n\nSutter moved up behind the bearded man and gave him a violent shove\nforward. \"In you go!\" he cried hysterically.\n\nTravail pitched head foremost. But, spinning, he clutched at Sutter's\narm, gripping it with the desperation of a drowning man. Half inside,\nhalf outside the cone of blue light he seemed propelled into the depths\nof the bisected shell by an irresistible force. In vain did Sutter fight\nto release the hold upon his arm. His squirming legs fastened themselves\nabout the legs of a heavy Windsor chair, kicked frantically.\n\nThe chair spun from between his feet and lurched heavily across the room\nwhere it fell hard upon the television set, shattering the glowing\nscreen into a thousand fragments. Simultaneously, Sutter slid forward\ninto the bisected shell as the cone of light vanished after him....\n\nMrs. Conworth, the landlady, reported the disappearance of her two\nroomers on August first, a week after she last saw them. First, however,\nto the disgust of the police, she cleaned their apartment, giving to the\ntrash man all valueless and inconsequential articles, including a box of\nold sea shells which she found in the closet. It was a curious fact that\nneither Sutter nor Travail possessed relatives or friends to make\ninquiry as to their whereabouts and thus without incentive the official\nsearch died into nothing.\n\nMrs. Conworth rather regretted the loss of her bachelor roomers and, as\nshe said to her neighbor across the street, she kept one memento of\nthem--a thing that looked like a shell but wasn't a shell. She thought\nit must be one of them optical illusion things.\n\n\"When you look at it in a certain way,\" said Mrs. Conworth, \"it seems as\nif there are two tiny men inside it, fighting to get out.\"\n\n",
