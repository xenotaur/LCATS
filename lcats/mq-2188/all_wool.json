Tuttle\n\nAuthor of \u201cA Bull Movement in Yellow Horse,\u201d\n\u201cPsychology and Copper,\u201d etc.\n\n\nZeb Whitney laid the ace of diamonds down on the rock and grinned at\nRicky Saunders.\n\n\u201cGo on, Ricky. Play that li\u2019l ol\u2019 jack. I got high, low, and that\njack will jist put me out. That\u2019ll make fifty thousand yuh owe me\nand\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nRicky laid his cards on the rock and peered over Zeb\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cLook at that sheep, Zeb! What do yuh reckon ails him?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind th\u2019 sheep,\u201d replied Zeb. \u201cYuh can\u2019t git me to turn\naround so yuh can eat that jack. Go on, play it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tell yuh somethin\u2019s wrong,\u201d insisted Ricky. \u201cThat sheep jist\nturned uh flip-flop and he ain\u2019t got up since.\u201d\n\n\u201cMebby that\u2019s th\u2019 way sheeps do,\u201d remarked Zeb. \u201cYuh see me and you\nain\u2019t been nursin\u2019 sheep but uh short time and we ain\u2019t hep to all\ntheir proclivities.\u201d\n\nRicky sat down and picked up his cards. \u201cI\u2019d shore like to know what\nhit that sheep. Honest, he jist\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n_Sping!_\n\nA bullet ricocheted off the rock they were using for a card-table\nand whined off down across the foothills.\n\n\u201cDuck!\u201d yelled Zeb, as he went crabwise down the opposite side of\nthe rock and slid around behind the stunted pine tree which had\nshaded their seven-up game.\n\n\u201cCome down here, yuh blamed mutt!\u201d he stormed at Ricky, who sat\nthere looking at the scratch on the rock where the bullet had\nglanced. \u201cAin\u2019t yuh got no sense a tall?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was it, Zeb?\u201d inquired Ricky innocently, as he slid down\nbeside Zeb and pulled out his papers and tobacco.\n\n\u201cSomebody was shootin\u2019 at us,\u201d stated Zeb. \u201cAnd danged good shootin\u2019\ntoo if anybody should ask yuh.\u201d\n\nRicky shaped his cigaret and fumbled for a match.\n\n\u201cSay, Zeb, I wonder if them same jaspers didn\u2019t hit that sheep? By\ngolly! I\u2019ll bet that was it. Mebby\u2014aw say, Zeb, if that was uh\nrifle-bullet why don\u2019t we hear th\u2019 report?\u201d\n\nZeb smiled patronizingly and relieved Ricky of his tobacco.\n\n\u201cRicky, them high-power rifles kin shoot three miles, and they don\u2019t\nmake much noise a-tall. At this distance yuh wouldn\u2019t hear it a\ntall, _sabe_?\u201d\n\nRicky got up and climbed back on the rock. He gazed off in the\ndirection from which the bullet had come and then sat down and began\ndealing the cards.\n\n\u201cCome on up, Zeb,\u201d he urged. \u201cThree miles is uh long ways to see uh\ntarget and th\u2019 man who can hit me at that distance is plumb welcome\nto cut uh notch on his gunstock, and besides it\u2019s too danged hot out\nthere in th\u2019 sun.\u201d\n\nZeb climbed back and sat down against the tree.\n\n\u201cRicky, I plumb wish we hadn\u2019t taken this job.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnha,\u201d agreed Ricky, intent on his solitaire layout.\n\n\u201cYes, sir, I am,\u201d continued Zeb. \u201cI knowed something was wrong when\nJim Watts offers us uh hundred apiece uh month to dry nurse these\ndarn animated wool gardens. Ricky, uh hundred dollars uh month is\ntoo much money to pay uh sheep-herder. Didn\u2019t yuh ever notice it?\u201d\n\nRicky laid down the cards and laughed.\n\n\u201cToo much? Why, Zeb, I\u2019d herd sheep for uh million dollars uh month.\nHonest, there ain\u2019t no large amount uh money that would be too big\nto tempt me to herd sheep.\u201d\n\n\u201cRicky,\u201d pronounced Zeb, \u201cyo\u2019re as funny as th\u2019 dobie itch. No man\npays that price unless thar\u2019s uh mighty good reason.\u201d\n\nRicky swept up the cards and put them in his pocket, and then\nsettled himself comfortably.\n\n\u201cZeb Whitney, every day is th\u2019 first of April to you. If I was as\nsuspicious as you are I\u2019d git arrested. Jist because we\u2019re uh long\nways from home and in uh strange land, and cause uh feller likes our\nlooks and gives us uh job takin\u2019 care of his woolen meal-tickets at\nso much per care, you immediately and soon gits th\u2019 idea that\nthere\u2019s uh brick under th\u2019 hat. Look at th\u2019 doughnut fer uh while,\nZeb, and quit lookin\u2019 at th\u2019 hole in th\u2019 center.\u201d\n\nZeb shook his head solemnly.\n\n\u201cDid yuh notice that there ain\u2019t no dogs connected with this outfit?\nDid yuh notice how scared that greaser was when we come and how\nquick he rolled his blankets and beat it? And also did yuh notice,\u201d\nhe continued before Ricky had a chance to reply, \u201cthat Watts said he\nwould give us a fat bonus if we kept th\u2019 herd here for two months?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s th\u2019 answer?\u201d yawned Ricky.\n\n\u201cSheep war.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaw! Haw!\u201d laughed Ricky. \u201cSheep war, eh? Who are th\u2019 sheep goin\u2019\nto fight?\n\nBy golly, Zeb, if these sheep want to start anything I\u2019ll\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHave uh little sense!\u201d growled Zeb. \u201cListen. I seems to remember\nreadin\u2019 uh few weeks ago about trouble brewin\u2019 between th\u2019 sheep and\ncattle men some place\u2014believe I reads it in th\u2019 Breeder\u2019s\nmagazine.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh course this would have to be th\u2019 place,\u201d replied Ricky\nsarcastically. \u201cYuh don\u2019t remember where it was, Zeb, but this shore\nmust be it. Trouble jist simply stalks in yore footsteps\u2014curses!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, anyway,\u201d stated Zeb, \u201cWatts will be back here in uh couple uh\nweeks with fresh grub and then I\u2019ll have uh li\u2019l heart-to-heart talk\nwith him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and jist about git into an argument with him and lose us our\njobs. Let\u2019s haze them burr catchers back to camp and git some grub.\u201d\n\nThe hazing part was easier said than done. It had been easy to let\nthe herd wander away from the bed ground in the cool of the morning\nbut it was a different task to round up three thousand sheep in the\nevening without the aid of dogs and herd them back to the shelter of\nthe little valley. Ricky and Zeb were cow-punchers by nature, and\nthis walking and running after sheep was not by any means\ndelightful. It was dark when they got back to camp and both were\nfagged out.\n\n\u201cNow, I reckon you\u2019ll remark that uh hundred uh month is too much\npay, eh?\u201d exploded Ricky, as he threw himself down on a blanket\ninside the tent and nursed a sore hip where an excited ram had hit\nhim on the run. \u201cTouch off that fire and let\u2019s git something to\neat.\u201d\n\nThe fire had been laid since morning. Zeb, knowing that in all\nprobabilities they would both be tired when night came, had\nthoughtfully laid a fire in the sheet-iron stove before leaving.\n\n\u201cTake that bucket and git some water from th\u2019 spring,\u201d ordered Zeb.\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget to strain th\u2019 wool out of it before yuh comes\nback.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where it is,\u201d wailed Ricky. \u201cI never saw any spring.\nWatts showed you where it was but I was up here all th\u2019 time\nwatchin\u2019 that greaser. Come on and show me where it is, Zeb. I\u2019d\nshore admire uh nice cool drink from th\u2019 wool-covered bucket that\nhung in th\u2019 well.\u201d\n\nZeb grumbled while he lit the fire and then picked up the bucket.\n\n\u201cCome on and I\u2019ll show yuh our water supply.\u201d\n\nThey went out of the tent and scrambled down the bank of a deep\nwashout behind the tent.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t slide into it,\u201d warned Zeb.\n\n\u201cAw, slide yer grandmother!\u201d retorted Ricky. \u201cAny time I slide you\ncan\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nRicky failed to state just what he would do in case he did happen to\nslide, for at that certain moment the whole world seemed to fly up\nand hit them in the face and they both flopped head first into the\nspring. A few seconds later something sailed down and lit with a\nloud smash in the bottom of the washout.\n\n\u201cGi-gi-git yer darned boots out of my mouth!\u201d gurgled Ricky. \u201cWhat\ndo yuh think my face is\u2014uh welcome mat?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat in the name of seven kinds of purgatory was that?\u201d mumbled\nZeb, wiping the water and mud out of his mouth.\n\n\u201cSwallered all th\u2019 water, ate all th\u2019 wool and had uh boot-heel for\nuh chaser,\u201d announced Ricky drunkenly.\n\n\u201cWhat in thunder hit in th\u2019 washout?\u201d asked Zeb.\n\n\u201cI ought to know,\u201d replied Ricky sarcastically. \u201cUnha, I reckon I\nought to know, bein\u2019 as I was under about seven feet uh alkali water\nwith yore boots in my mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard it hit,\u201d stated Zeb.\n\n\u201cUnha,\u201d agreed Ricky. \u201cSounded like uh hardware store done leaped\nbefore it looked. Let\u2019s go back to th\u2019 tent and see what happened.\u201d\n\nThey climbed back up the bank and started for the tent, when Zeb\ngrabbed Ricky by the arm and gasped in astonishment.\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d he whispered.\n\nRicky rubbed a muddy hand across his eyes.\n\n\u201cShe ain\u2019t,\u201d he remarked inanely. \u201cZeb, she\u2019s done went away.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiant powder!\u201d exclaimed Zeb, sniffing the air. \u201cSomebody done put\ndinnamite in our stove, Ricky!\u201d\n\nRicky walked around the hole in the ground where the tent had stood.\n\n\u201cTent\u2019s gone,\u201d he announced foolishly. \u201cGood-by tent! Jerusalem!\nZeb, our grub is all gone, too! Blewed up. Rifle gone, too,\nand\u2014say, Zeb, you got yore six-gun\u2014unha, yo\u2019re gun\u2019s safe but mine\nwas on th\u2019 grub-box.\u201d\n\n\u201cSheeps gone too,\u201d stated Zeb.\n\n\u201cBlew\u2014aw, what do we care. I reckon they heard th\u2019 noise and hit\nfer th\u2019 hills. What do we care for th\u2019 sheep, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cBlankets gone,\u201d groaned Zeb. \u201cNothin\u2019 to eat and no place to sleep.\nNow mebby you\u2019ll agree with me that this ain\u2019t no white man\u2019s job,\nRicky.\u201d\n\n\u201cMan size, anyway,\u201d replied Ricky, sitting down and rolling a\ncigaret.\n\nZeb watched him in silence until the smoke was made and then an idea\nseemed to strike him:\n\n\u201cHow much smokin\u2019 yuh got on yore person, Ricky?\u201d\n\nRicky held up a limp sack containing about two more cigarets.\n\n\u201cAnd I ain\u2019t got uh bit,\u201d stated Zeb. \u201cShe was all in that de-funct\ngrub-box.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d remarked the philosophical Ricky, \u201cthey can\u2019t blow our camp\nup no more. It ain\u2019t as though they had only blew up part of it.\nGolly, Zeb, I\u2019m shore hungry! What about uh little supper, eh? Give\nme yore gun and I\u2019ll see if I can pick uh fat blatter in th\u2019 dark\nwhile you builds uh little fire, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe tastes to me like it was uh sinful waste uh lead,\u201d stated Ricky\nabout an hour later, as he raked a piece of half-cooked meat out of\nthe coals. \u201cDoggone it, Zeb, uh sheep ought to be raised fer wool\nexclusive. As uh tender morsel I opines that she runs uh dead heat\nwith owls and rawhide. Pass th\u2019 salt please.\u201d\n\nZeb threw a piece of smoking meat at Ricky\u2019s head and rolled over on\nthe ground.\n\n\u201cRicky, what are we goin\u2019 to do? Will we roll out of here and let\nth\u2019 sheep nurse themselves or will we stay here until Watts comes or\nuntil we starve to death? Golly, he can\u2019t blame us if we do leave.\nWhat yuh say?\u201d\n\n\u201cLeavin\u2019 all jokin\u2019 aside, Zeb, jist what does this all mean?\u201d asked\nRicky. \u201cGot any real idea, Zeb?\u201d\n\n\u201cSheep war,\u201d stated Zeb. \u201cOr at any rate I believes she is. I takes\nit that th\u2019 cattlemen here are uh heap sore at th\u2019 sheep and wants\nto drive \u2019em all off th\u2019 range. I reads it all in that article back\nin Blue Joint. I reckon that is why we gits this job so easy. Watts\nain\u2019t got no other place to range his woolies and he\u2019s plumb got to\nhave herders. Greasers won\u2019t put up no fight a-tall, and so he pays\nuh big salary to white men to guard his property, _sabe_? I figgers\nit that some of th\u2019 hangers-on of th\u2019 cattlemen done went and loaded\nour stove with giant powder and takes uh chance that we\u2019ll git\nelevated so much that we won\u2019t look at no sheep-herdin\u2019 job no more,\nRicky. That\u2019s uh dirty mucker trick I takes it.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnha,\u201d agreed Ricky. \u201cI shore hates to quit in uh case like that.\nMebby we\u2019ll starve or go crazy and start blattin\u2019 like uh pair uh\ntwo-legged woolies, Zebbie, old top but I\u2019m game to sit in th\u2019 game\nfor uh few days yet. What say?\u201d\n\nThey solemnly shook hands across their little fire and then Ricky\nproduced that greasy deck of cards again.\n\n\u201cDoggone yo\u2019re hide,\u201d he drawled, \u201cI\u2019ll play yuh to see if she\u2019s uh\nhundred thousand or quits. That last jack wasn\u2019t le-gitimate, Zeb.\nIt\u2019s got uh corner torn and yuh knowed it.\u201d\n\nThe next three days were a nightmare of chasing sheep through the\ndust and heat and then eating half-cooked mutton for breakfast,\ndinner and supper, and of sleeping on the bare ground with nothing\nbut the sky for a blanket. It gets cool in the small hours of the\nmorning in the range country, albeit the thermometer rises to the\ncentury mark in the shade at midday.\n\nDuring that time they had glimpses of cowboys riding across the\nupper part of the range but there had been no further demonstrations\nof violence.\n\nOn the morning of the fourth day it was a gaunted, sorrowful pair of\nshepherds who trailed that big bunch of sheep out of the valley and\nup the hills. Zeb strode in the lead and hurled imprecations on all\nwool-bearing animals, as one old ram detached himself from the band\nand tried to go back to the bed ground.\n\n\u201c\u2019At a boy!\u201d yelled Ricky, as Zeb bounced a piece of basalt rock off\nthe ram\u2019s head. \u201cGit back yuh old curly horned animated bock-beer\nsign!\u201d he whooped as the ram lowered its head and dove for him.\n\nRicky made a frantic effort to escape, and although the ram failed\nto hit him square they both went down in a heap and rolled down the\nhill. Zeb forgot his peeve in the excitement and doubled up with\nmirth.\n\n\u201cHaw! Haw! Haw!\u201d roared a strange voice, as Ricky succeeded in\ngetting on top of the ram. \u201cHaw! Haw! Pretty good for uh shepherd.\u201d\n\nZeb turned and faced three cowboys on horseback, who had ridden up\nunnoticed. They slouched in their saddles and grinned at Ricky\u2019s\nefforts to choke the ram. Ricky kicked the ram in the ribs and then\nlimped up to where Zeb was.\n\n\u201cHaw! Haw!\u201d mimicked Ricky in a sneering tone. \u201cI knowed uh jackass\noncet which had uh voice like that and also about th\u2019 same idea of\nhumor.\u201d\n\n\u201cSweet-tempered little shepherd, ain\u2019t he?\u201d laughed one of the\npunchers. \u201cEatin\u2019 raw sheep meat ain\u2019t calmed his disposition none\nwhatever.\u201d\n\n\u201cI likes \u2019em raw,\u201d stated Ricky. \u201cI also like cow-punchers when\nthey\u2019re not too raw, but they\u2019re usually uh little too light fer uh\nman-sized re-past.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s uh plenty,\u201d snarled the one at whom Ricky had seemingly been\nmaking his remarks. \u201cWe never came over here to exchange\npleasantries with shepherds. We\u2019re here to tell yuh to move yore\nwoolies off this range right now, _sabe_? Tonight is th\u2019 night.\nAfter this there ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to be no more sheep on th\u2019 Willow Creek\nrange. If you won\u2019t move \u2019em, we will, _sabe_?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou fellers,\u201d drawled Ricky, \u201creminds me of dynamite in uh tin\nstove. It makes uh lot uh noise and messes up uh lot uh good grub\nand\u2014oh well, if yuh don\u2019t want to hear what I think of yuh, jist\nkeep on goin\u2019,\u201d he remarked, as the three turned their horses and\ngalloped off across the hills.\n\n\u201cWell, what do yuh know about that?\u201d groaned Zeb. \u201cI reckon tonight\nis th\u2019 night we move, Ricky.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnha,\u201d agreed Ricky. \u201cI reckon yore right. Dang bust the luck! I\nsprained my thumb on that old ram. Wow! She shore hurts.\u201d\n\nZeb shoved his hands down in his overall pockets and frowned at the\nsun.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s twenty miles to Mill City, Ricky. Did yuh ever think about\nwhat a walk that is?\u201d\n\n\u201cGosh, uh sore thumb is terrible, Zeb!\u201d wailed Ricky. \u201cI ain\u2019t in no\nshape to walk a tall now. Twenty miles! Gee, Zeb, I never did nor\nnever will walk that far with my insides cryin\u2019 out fer grub th\u2019 way\nthey are right now. I reckon I\u2019ve plumb lost my appetite.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gittin\u2019 sorta finicky myself,\u201d agreed Zeb. \u201cI don\u2019t seem to\nlook upon uh piece uh sheep meat th\u2019 way uh hungry man should.\u201d\n\nA continuous repast of mutton and salt is almost sure to make even\nthe best of digestive apparatus go awry. They had eaten it roasted\nin the coals, baked in clay, boiled in the water bucket and fried on\na piece of the sheet-iron stove which had survived the explosion.\nThe morning meal had been thrown away untasted.\n\nThat day they laid in the shade of the lone pine tree, too miserable\nto even play seven-up. At dinner-time they grinned and pulled up\nanother notch on their belts. Both of them were inveterate\ncigaret-smokers\u2014or rather had been until, as Ricky remarked:\n\n\u201cDynamite is uh sure cure fer th\u2019 cigaret habit, Zeb. She cures but\nshe don\u2019t remove th\u2019 cravin\u2019.\u201d\n\nThat night they wended their weary way back to the bed ground and\nleft the sheep out on the range. They had decided that there was no\nreason for bringing in the herd. If the cattlemen were bent on\nchasing them out of the country, why not let them have the trouble\nof rounding them up?\n\n\u201cWant some boiled mutton?\u201d asked Ricky, after they had thrown their\ntired bodies down on the ground above the spring.\n\nZeb sat up and reached for a rock but the effort was too much and he\nflopped down again.\n\n\u201cRicky,\u201d he murmured, \u201cif I ever gits my strength back again\u2014I\nhates to do it, Ricky\u2014but I\u2019m goin\u2019 to massacree you.\u201d\n\nRicky got up painfully and built a little fire.\n\n\u201cShe seems more homelike thataway, Zeb. If I passes out I shore\ndon\u2019t want to do it in th\u2019 dark. Judas Priest, I wish I had uh\nsmoke.\u201d\n\n\u201cOld man Lute was uh goldarned brute, and he couldn\u2019t git his\nlonghorns up th\u2019 goldarned chute,\u201d sang Zeb, in a low mournful\nvoice. \u201cI wonder if they\u2019re bluffin\u2019 or if they really means to hold\nuh party down here tonight?\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t got uh danged thing to wear,\u201d wailed Ricky. \u201cMy tailor done\ntold me this mornin\u2019: \u2018Mr. Saunders, I can\u2019t possibley git that\nswaller-tailed\u2014\u2014\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201c_Sh-h-h-h!_\u201d cautioned Zeb, sitting up and grasping Ricky by the\nsleeve. \u201cListen! Hear anything?\u201d\n\nA faint tinkle like the light tap of metal on stone sounded from up\nthe washout, and was immediately followed by a smothered\nexclamation.\n\nZeb rolled over and slid feet first down the washout and pulled\nRicky with him just as a bullet ploughed through their little fire\nand a streak of orange flame flashed further up the gully. Zeb\nducked low and started up the washout in the direction of the\ngun-flash.\n\n\u201cWhere yuh goin\u2019?\u201d whispered Ricky, trailing along behind.\n\n\u201cKeep down low,\u201d commanded Zeb. \u201cWe got to git in behind \u2019em. Come\non and keep quiet.\u201d\n\nThey sneaked along for a few hundred yards when Zeb stopped and\npeered over the bank.\n\n\u201cI got it all figgered out, Ricky. Them jaspers never walked over to\nth\u2019 party. It\u2019s all of seven miles to th\u2019 nearest cow-camp. I\u2019m\nfiggerin\u2019 that they\u2014look out! Git down low!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat yuh see?\u201d\n\n\u201cJist what I expected. Them jaspers done left their hosses over by\nthat bunch of cottonwoods. Look! See it?\u201d\n\n\u201cSee what?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, Ricky, and keep down low. They\u2019ve left one feller over\nthere with th\u2019 hosses and, Ricky, he\u2019s smokin\u2019 uh real cigaret!\u201d\n\n\u201cUh cigaret,\u201d murmured Ricky. \u201cMama mine, I\u2019d spank uh female\ngrizzly\u2019s cub in th\u2019 ol\u2019 lady\u2019s presence for one long drag on uh\ncigaret. Ouch\u2014gol dang\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c_Sh-h-h-h!_\u201d sibilated Zeb.\n\n\u201cAw\u2014if you\u2019d got yer knees in uh cactus patch you\u2019d say\n_sh-h-h-h-h_!\u201d retorted Ricky in an undertone.\n\nThey sneaked around behind the patch of cottonwoods and in behind\nthe four horses. Those range-bred horses made no move except to\nnuzzle Ricky as he whispered\u2014\n\n\u201cSteady li\u2019l bronks.\u201d\n\nThe cowboy sat on his heels some distance in front of the horses and\npuffed away at his cigaret. Ricky got one good whiff of that cigaret\nand then took one long step and dove straight for the unsuspecting\ncowboy. Ricky\u2019s right arm described a short arc as he plunged, and\nthe cowboy rolled over without a sound.\n\nRicky got up and rolled him over and felt of his heart.\n\n\u201cFine work!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cThat loaded quirt I took off that saddle\nwas jist th\u2019 thing, Zeb. Look what I got.\u201d\n\nHe held up a sack of tobacco and a book of cigaret-papers.\n\n\u201cAnd that ain\u2019t all either,\u201d he continued. \u201cI found this roll uh\nbills in th\u2019 same pocket and\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRicky, we ain\u2019t thieves,\u201d stated Zeb.\n\n\u201cNot any,\u201d agreed Ricky. \u201cBut, Zeb, this ain\u2019t stealin\u2019. Somebody\u2019s\ngot to pay th\u2019 freight, and it\u2019s uh cinch that I ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to\nsearch fer Watts to collect uh few days\u2019 pay. We simply got to have\nuh little money and if it eases yore mind any, Zeb, you can consider\nthis my money, _sabe_?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re comin\u2019 back, Ricky!\u201d\n\nLoud voices raised in a heated argument floated across the\nsage-brush flat and coming closer all the time.\n\n\u201cYou take that big roan, Ricky, and I\u2019ll take th\u2019 black. Slip th\u2019\nbridles off the other two and cut their cinches.\u201d\n\nIt was but a moment\u2019s work to slip the rigs off the extra horses,\nand then they mounted and moved off slowly in the shadow of the\ntrees until they were behind the cottonwoods. Suddenly there was a\nshout from the cowboys and they knew their work had been discovered.\nRicky pulled up his big roan and turned in the saddle.\n\n\u201cWalk, dang yuh, walk!\u201d he yelled at the top of his voice and then,\nspurring their horses, they streaked off across the moonlit\nfoothills in the general direction of Mill City, followed by a\nscattering volley of pistol-shots and unprintable remarks.\n\nIt was noon the next day when they rode into the little town of Mill\nCity. They had taken the wrong road and had ridden miles out of\ntheir way before they met a person who set them on the right trail.\nThey rode up in front of a Chinese restaurant and Ricky handed his\nreins to Zeb and slid painfully to the ground.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll order everything he\u2019s got,\u201d he announced. \u201cYou put them horses\nin a stable some place and hurry back. Gosh, I\u2019m starved plumb to\ndeath.\u201d\n\nZeb rode on up the street to the one livery-stable. He was too\nhungry and tired to take off the saddles so he left the horses\noutside.\n\n\u201cUnsaddle \u2019em and give \u2019em uh good feed,\u201d he ordered the stable man,\nand then started back to the restaurant.\n\nHe had almost reached the door when he saw Ricky come out, propelled\nby a big bearded person, who whirled his partner around roughly and\nstarted down the street, shoving him by the shoulder. Ricky was\nprotesting loudly and already several people were walking curiously\ntoward them. Zeb quickened his pace until he was walking at Ricky\u2019s\nside.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s th\u2019 trouble?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m arrested, that\u2019s all!\u201d exclaimed Ricky, and Zeb, acting on the\nspur of the moment and without any preliminary windup, whirled and\nsmashed the officer on the jaw with his right.\n\nThe officer dropped like a rock. It was a clean knock-out. Zeb gave\nhim one look and then grabbed Ricky by the arm.\n\n\u201cCome on!\u201d he yelled. \u201cRun, you son-of-a-gun, run! We\u2019ve got to git\nto them hosses quick!\u201d\n\nHe dashed off down the dusty street and Ricky pounded along behind.\nSeveral people on the street had seen the blow struck but they made\nno move to stop the pair. The suddenness of it all and the limp form\nof the officer lying there on the board sidewalk drew their\nattention more than did the two dust-covered figures racing for the\nlivery-stable.\n\n\u201cPure bull luck!\u201d panted Zeb. \u201cThem hosses ain\u2019t been unsaddled yet.\n\u201cGit a-goin\u2019!\u201d he yelled as he climbed into the saddle and spurred\nthe black around the corner.\n\nRicky needed no urging. His big roan was right on the heels of the\nblack when they hit the down grade toward Sweet Grass Valley.\n\nNot a word was spoken until they had put at least a dozen miles\nbetween them and Mill City. At the forks of the road, Zeb pulled up\nand turned in his saddle.\n\n\u201cWhich one do yuh reckon th\u2019 posse will take in case they hit our\ntrail, Ricky?\u201d\n\nRicky rolled a smoke and scratched his head foolishly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t reckon it makes much difference which one we take,\u201d he\nremarked. \u201cThey ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to foller us far. Hittin\u2019 uh deputy\nain\u2019t no hangin\u2019 matter, Zeb.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but hoss stealin\u2019 is,\u201d reminded Zeb seriously.\n\n\u201cWho said anything about horse stealin\u2019?\u201d demanded Ricky.\n\nZeb squinted his eyes and looked Ricky over carefully from heels to\nhat.\n\n\u201cSay, Ricky, jist about what in the devil did that feller arrest yuh\nfor?\u201d\n\n\u201cHittin\u2019 uh Chinaman,\u201d chuckled Ricky, between puffs.\n\n\u201cHittin\u2019 uh Chinaman!\u201d exploded Zeb. \u201cWhat fer?\u201d\n\n\u201cZeb\u2014\u201d Ricky leaned over and put his hand on Zeb\u2019s shoulder and a\nhumorous light twinkled in his gray eyes\u2014\u201cI hadn\u2019t no more than sat\ndown in that restaurant until one uh them danged slant-eyed\ncelestials comes over to me and says, \u2018You likee some nice roast\nmutton?\u2019\u201d\n\nZeb reached over and shook hands solemnly with Ricky and then turned\nhis horse down the left-hand fork of the road.\n\n\u201cRicky,\u201d he laughed, \u201c\u2018let\u2019s git a-goin\u2019. This country is all wool\nbut she ain\u2019t wide enough fer me and you.\u201d\n\nTHE END",
