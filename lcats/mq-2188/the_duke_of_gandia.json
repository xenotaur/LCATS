Ours it shall be, body and soul, and great\n   Above all power and glory given of God\n   To them that died to set thee where thou art\u2014\n   Throned on the dust of C\u00e6sar and of Christ,\n   Imperial.  Earth shall quail again, and rise\n   Again the higher because she trembled.  Rome\n   So bade it be: it was, and shall be.\n\n                                ALEXANDER\n\n               Son,\n   Art thou my son?\n\n                                  C\u00c6SAR\n\n         Whom should thy radiant Rose\n   Have found so fit to ingraff with, and bring forth\n   So strong a scion as I am?\n\n                                ALEXANDER\n\n            By my faith\u2014\n   Wherein, I know not\u2014by my soul, if that\n   Be\u2014I believe it.  God forgot his doom\n   When he thou hast slain drew breath before thee\n\n                                  C\u00c6SAR\n\n               God\n   Must needs forget\u2014if God remember.  Now\n   This thing thou hast loved, and I that swept him hence\n   Held never fit for hate of mine, is dead,\n   Wilt thou be one with me\u2014one God?  No less,\n   Lord Christ of Rome, thou wilt be.\n\n                                ALEXANDER\n\n            Ay?  The Dove?\n\n                                  C\u00c6SAR\n\n   What dove, though lovelier than the swan that lured\n   Leda to love of God on earth, might match\n   Lucrezia?\n\n                                ALEXANDER\n\n      None.  Thou art subtle of soul and strong.\n   I would thou hadst spared him\u2014couldst have spared him.\n\n                                  C\u00c6SAR\n\n         Sire,\n   I would so too.  Our sire, his sire and mine,\n   I slew not him for lust of slaying, or hate,\n   Or aught less like thy wiser spirit and mine.\n\n                                ALEXANDER\n\n   Not for the dove\u2019s sake?\n\n                                  C\u00c6SAR\n\n         Not for hate or love.\n   Death was the lot God bade him draw, if God\n   Be more than what we make him.\n\n                                ALEXANDER\n\n               Bread and wine\n   Could hardly turn so bitter.  Canst thou sleep?\n\n                                  C\u00c6SAR\n\n   Dost thou not?  Flesh must sleep to live.  Am I\n   No son of thine?\n\n                                ALEXANDER\n\n            I would I saw thine end,\n   And mine: and yet I would not.\n\n                                  C\u00c6SAR\n\n               Sire, good night.\n\n                                                                 [_Exeunt_\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n                                PRINTED BY\n               SPOTTISWOODE AND CO.
