Eldridge=\n\nThese fill an urgent need in supplying musical numbers with action, for\nany secular program, for girls or ladies of any age. Clever words and\nsingable music combined to make novel numbers for your entertainment.\n\n=THE HAT OF OTHER DAYS.= Everyone knows how ridiculous the changing\nstyles make out-of-date hats appear. The song is based on this fact,\nand the appearance of these \u201chats of other days\u201d will cause loads of\nmerriment.\n\n\u201c=I CAN\u2019T DO A THING WITH MY HAIR SINCE IT\u2019S WASHED.=\u201d Did you ever\nhear the above expression? They all say it. This song is for a merry\ngroup of girls who have trouble in keeping their hair in bounds. A\njolly song.\n\n=REDUCED TO $1.99.= The figures in a dry goods show window are\nindignant at having to participate in so many \u201creduction sales,\u201d and,\nrevolting, walk off the stage after telling their troubles in song. The\neccentric motions of these figures make a very laughable number.\n\n=THE WINNING WAYS OF GRANDMA\u2019S DAYS.= Sung in costume, this portrays\nthe many welcome and pleasing costumes of \u201cye olden times.\u201d Directions\nfor minuet included. Very enjoyable.\n\n    =Any one of the above sent postpaid on receipt of 25 cents.=\n    \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    =ELDRIDGE ENTERTAINMENT HOUSE=\n    =Franklin, Ohio=\n\n\n\n\n    A DAY AT CAMP KILLKARE\n\n    \u2014OR\u2014\n\n    Aunt Jane and the Campfire Girls.\n\n    Copyright, 1915, Eldridge Entertainment House.\n\n\n    PUBLISHED BY\n    ELDRIDGE ENTERTAINMENT HOUSE,\n    FRANKLIN, OHIO.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE.\n\n\nThe scenery is the same for both acts. If given out doors select\nif possible a place among trees or large bushes. One tent will be\nsufficient to represent the camp, and only a portion of this need be\nvisible. A hammock with bright colored cushions will add to the effect.\nHave one or two camp stools, a sketching outfit, and a Kodak near the\ntent.\n\nIf the play is given indoors small trees or leafy branches placed in\nbuckets of sand may be used to represent the woods. Cover the floor\nwith brown denim or linen, and scatter leaves, pineneedles and cones\nupon it.\n\nThe campers wear middy blouses with short dark skirts or bloomers. Miss\nMorgan\u2019s costume is similar except that her skirt is longer.\n\nLucille and Miss Pickett wear any costume appropriate for motoring and\nthe latter carries a lorgnette.\n\n\n\n\n_Characters._\n\n\n    Bettie }\n    Ruth   }\n    Hilda  } Campers.\n    Hope   }\n    Kitty  }\n\nMiss Morgan, a teacher in charge of the camp.\n\nMiss Pickett, an elderly lady who disapproves of camps.\n\nLucille, her niece.\n\n\nSuggestions.\n\nThe character of Miss Pickett offers great opportunity for comedy, as\nmuch of the success of the play will depend upon her ability to be\nserious, yet funny. Her efforts to keep up with the girls in their\ndrills and exercises, her ludicrous appearance in the misfit costume\nin the second scene should make a hit. A little musical program\ninterpolated at any point or points the director sees fit will add to\nthe enjoyment and lengthen the play. \u201cI Can\u2019t Do a Thing With My Hair\nSince It\u2019s Washed,\u201d an action song for young ladies, price 25 cents,\nwill fit admirably in this play.\n\nDrills may be introduced in the second act if desired, a bow and arrow\ndrill, or dumb bell drill being especially appropriate.\n\nA brief program of songs and recitations may also be included in the\nsecond act.\n\n\n\n\nA Day at Camp Killkare.\n\n\nSCENE I.\n\n_As the curtain rises girls are seen seated, Hilda embroidering, Ruth\nbusy with raffia, Hope making a basket. Enter Kitty._\n\n_Kitty._ Look at the industry on a warm morning. I\u2019ll be the sluggard.\n(_Seats herself in the hammock and opens a book._) How\u2019s the fancy\nwork, Hilda?\n\n_Hilda._ I wish the old thing was done. Carolyn sails next week and I\nwant this traveling case to be finished in time.\n\n_Hope._ I wish I were going on a nice trip like Carolyn.\n\n_Kitty._ Uncle Fred went to Europe last summer, and he said he was\nsimply tired of the everlasting tipping. Finally he saw a sign in his\nroom at the hotel, \u201cPlease tip the basin after using,\u201d and he said he\ndrew the line there.\n\n_Hilda._ I\u2019d love the ocean voyage, and I know I wouldn\u2019t be afraid,\neven in a storm. Mother told me that when she went over, there was\nan old lady who was terribly nervous, and each day she pestered the\ncaptain, asking him how far it was to land. Finally one day he answered\nher politely, \u201cFive miles, madam.\u201d She was delighted and asked very\neagerly \u201cwhere?\u201d and he told her \u201cstraight down below our keel, madam.\u201d\n\n_Kitty._ Uncle Fred wasn\u2019t a bit seasick, but one day on deck a man\nand his wife were near him, all bundled up in their steamer chairs and\nlooking terribly woebegone. Their little boy was playing around full\nof mischief, and the mother said feebly, \u201cPapa, won\u2019t you speak to\nWillie?\u201d And papa said just as feebly, \u201cHow do you do, Willie?\u201d\n\n_Ruth._ Well, I don\u2019t like troublesome children. I had to take care of\nCousin Julia\u2019s baby all one afternoon and he did nothing but cry. So I\nlet him cry into the phonograph, so that when he grew up he could hear\nwhat a troublesome baby he had been.\n\n_Kitty._ I ought to be studying, seeing as I flunked in history this\nJune.\n\n_Hope._ I don\u2019t believe you know a thing about history, Kit.\n\n_Kitty._ Yes, I do. I know that when the great patriot, Nathan Hale,\nwas about to be executed he said, \u201cWould that I were a cat that I might\nhave nine lives to give to my country.\u201d\n\n_Hope._ Where\u2019s Betty?\n\n_Ruth._ Gone for the mail.\n\n_Hilda._ Miss Morgan with her?\n\n_Hope._ No, Miss Morgan went down to the lake to sketch.\n\n_Kitty._ I wish I were an artist. I tried to paint a sunset once, but\nthe family thought it was a tomato omelet, so I forebore.\n\n_Ruth._ Betty\u2019s taking her time with the mail.\n\n_Hope._ I gave her five cents for lollypops.\n\n_Kitty._ I gave her ten. What\u2019s camp without lollypops?\n\n    (_Distant call is heard \u201cWohelo.\u201d_)\n\n_Girls._ (_reply_) Wohelo.\n\n    (_Enter Miss Morgan with sketching outfit._)\n\n_Miss Morgan._ Did I hear Betty call?\n\n_Ruth._ Yes, she\u2019s just coming up the path.\n\n    (_Enter Betty with mail bag slung over her shoulder._)\n\n_Betty._ (_Wiping her forehead._) Whew, it\u2019s a warm day.\n\n_Hope._ (_Reaching for mail bag._) Here, hand over the letters like a\nnice lady.\n\n    (_Girls crowd around Betty._)\n\n_Betty._ (_waving them back._) Stand back, ladies, and show some\nrespect for the representative of the postal system of our nation.\n_I\u2019ll_ distribute the mail.\n\n_Hilda._ I hope I got a letter.\n\n_Betty._ You don\u2019t deserve one for you only write postals.\n\n_Hilda._ I only wrote two last week.\n\n_Betty._ (_distributing mail_) Miss Hope Harwood.\n\n_Hope._ Oh, that\u2019s from mother.\n\n_Betty._ Miss Morgan, two letters and a paper.\n\n_Miss Morgan._ Thank you, Betty.\n\n_Betty._ What an example! Miss Morgan is the only one who has thanked\nme for bringing her letters up a steep mountain path beset by tiger\nlillies, dandelions, foxglove, wolfsbane and every flower carrying a\npistil.\n\n_Kitty._ Go on and pass out the mail.\n\n_Betty._ Miss Kitty Carroll, Miss Ruth Scott. That\u2019s all but the\nlollypops and here they are.\n\n_Hope._ Did you get my stamps?\n\n_Betty._ Oh no, I forgot them.\n\n_Hope._ You said you\u2019d surely remember and you tied a knot in your\nhandkerchief.\n\n_Betty._ Well it was a forget-me-knot that time.\n\n_Ruth._ Oh, isn\u2019t this a pity? Lucille can\u2019t come. Her aunt\u2019s going to\ntake her on a motor trip.\n\n_Kitty._ Motor trip? I should think that would be lovely.\n\n_Ruth._ Not a motor trip a la Aunt Jane. Aunt Camilla and Uncle Samuel\nwill go along. Lucille and the two aunts will sit squeezed together\non the back seat, and the conversation will be exclusively devoted to\nnervous dyspepsia and sciatica. When Uncle Samuel can get a word in\nedgewise he will pipe up about the wholesale price of lard and pork.\n\n_Hilda._ Lovely prospect for Lucille.\n\n_Miss Morgan._ Girls, I have good news for you. I have a letter from\nMiss Pickett, Lucille\u2019s Aunt Jane, and she writes that she has decided\nto surprise Lucille. They will stop here and visit us for a day on\ntheir way to join Mr. and Mrs. Brown.\n\n_Kitty._ That\u2019s Uncle Samuel and Aunt Camilla of pork and lard fame.\n\n_Betty._ Hooray, girls!\n\n_Miss Morgan._ She sent me a special delivery letter which for some\nreason was not delivered last night.\n\n_Betty._ The postmaster told me he was already to go to lodge, so he\nthought the letter could wait till morning.\n\n_Kitty._ He was as bad as the telegraph operator at Birchwood last\nsummer. Uncle\u2019s partner sent him a code message, and the operator never\ndelivered it. He said \u201cIt didn\u2019t make no sense so he didn\u2019t see no use\nof walking two miles with it.\u201d\n\n_Hilda._ When is Lucille coming, Miss Morgan?\n\n_Miss Morgan._ The fourteenth\u2014why that\u2019s today.\n\n_Betty._ Dear me, girls, we must hurry and get this place fixed up.\n\n_Miss Morgan._ Are your tents in order? They were at inspection this\nmorning but they\u2019ve had time to get disarranged.\n\n_Kitty._ Mine is spick and span. I believe in a place for everything\nand everything in its place.\n\n_Ruth._ And that place is the tray of your trunk.\n\n_Kitty._ Well, what\u2019s the objection to that? When I want a ribbon or a\nbelt I simply stir up a bit like this (_gesture_) till it comes to the\nsurface.\n\n_Hilda._ Aunt Jane is horribly tidy and terribly particular.\n\n_Betty._ You\u2019re right there. She took the dust out of industrious.\n\n_Miss Morgan._ Better pick up those few papers, girls.\n\n_Hope._ Sure. Let\u2019s lay out some plain sewing and a few improving\nbooks, so as to give a good impression.\n\n    (_Sound of motor horn._)\n\n_Ruth._ Oh, there\u2019s the car, come on girls and meet them.\n\n    (_Exit girls;_)\n\n(_Miss Morgan glances in tent, straightens pillows in hammock, and puts\naway her sketching outfit._)\n\n_Miss Morgan._ I do hope that we can impress Miss Pickett favorably so\nthat she will allow Lucille to stay with us, but that is a little too\nmuch to expect. Poor child, I believe her aunt would like to send her\nto an old-fashioned boarding school, if she could find one, and have\nher taught to make alum baskets and play the Maiden\u2019s Prayer.\n\n(_Enter Miss Pickett, Lucille and campers._)\n\n_Miss Pickett._ This is a terrible hill. It will give me nervous\ndyspepsia or sciatica or both.\n\n_Miss Morgan._ Miss Pickett, we are delighted to see you at our\ncamp.... (_Kisses Lucille_) Lucille, dear, this is lovely.\n\n_Betty._ Isn\u2019t this great to have Lucille here?\n\n_Kitty._ (_politely_) And Miss Pickett.\n\n(_Girls assist Miss Pickett and Lucille to remove their wraps._)\n\n_Miss Morgan._ Did you have a pleasant trip?\n\n_Miss Pickett._ It was quite tiresome for we lost our way. All the\nguide posts told us to use Scrubit Soap or Purple Pills for Pale\nPeople. Then for the last half hour when they did condescend to mention\nPineville, it was always the same distance. First it was eight miles\nto Pineville, then after riding ten minutes it was eight miles to\nPineville, and then after fifteen minutes it was still eight miles to\nPineville. The chauffeur was quite impertinent, for he said, \u201cThank\ngoodness, we are holding our own anyway.\u201d\n\n_Miss Morgan._ How very annoying.\n\n_Miss Pickett._ Well, Lucille was so set on coming that I decided to\nlet her have a day of it. Though for the life of me I can\u2019t see the\nfun of having spiders crawl over you while you sleep, and ants in the\ncoffee, and eating canned stuff for weeks. I will say frankly it is not\nmy idea of a ladylike vacation.\n\n_Miss Morgan._ We certainly appreciate your kindness in bringing\nLucille when it caused you so much inconvenience.\n\n_Betty._ Miss Pickett may I lend Lucille a middy blouse and skirt for\nthe day?\n\n_Miss Pickett._ Well, to tell the truth I never approved of that\ncostume. The middies, as you call them, remind me of the way the\nChinese laundrymen wear their clothes. I like a dress neatly belted in.\n\n_Kitty._ But Lucille might spoil her suit.\n\n_Betty._ It is such a stylish suit. Did you have it made in New York?\n\n_Miss Pickett._ (_pleased_) No, the dressmaker made it under my\nsupervision. Very well, Lucille, you may accept Betty\u2019s offer.\n\n_Miss Morgan._ Miss Pickett suppose you and I go down to the lake where\nit is cooler.\n\n_Kitty._ Oh, that will be lovely, Miss Morgan, take her out in the\ncanoe.\n\n_Miss Pickett._ No indeed. My nephew Robert has one, and on one\noccasion he wished to have a discussion with his father. My brother\nJonas is quick tempered and will never listen to argument so Robert\ninvited him out in his canoe, and when he had Jonas out in the middle\nof the river he opened up the subject. Poor Jonas didn\u2019t dare to walk\nup and down the way he usually does, but he had to sit still and\nlisten calmly for Robert warned him that the canoe would upset at the\nslightest motion.\n\n_Hilda._ It was very diplomatic of Robert.\n\n_Miss Morgan._ We can sit by the lake and enjoy the breezes.\n\n_Lucille._ And hear the very latest in the line of dyspepsia and\nsciatica.\n\n_Miss Pickett._ Well Lucille, you may accept Betty\u2019s kind offer of a\nmiddy blouse and skirt. Hang your coat carefully on a hanger and don\u2019t\nfall into the lake whatever you do.\n\n_Hope._ (_softly_) Hang your clothes on a hickory limb but don\u2019t go\nnear the water.\n\n_Betty._ Come on girls for we must crowd two weeks\u2019 fun into a single\nday.\n\n    (_Exit All_)\n\n\n\n\nSCENE II\n\n\n(_Ruth seated with raffia work, enter other girls laughing._)\n\n_Kitty._ Oh Ruth what do you suppose has happened?\n\n_Hope._ Oh I couldn\u2019t keep my face straight.\n\n_Hilda._ It was perfectly awful.\n\n_Hope._ I was scared.\n\n_Kitty._ Scared nothing. The water was only a foot deep.\n\n_Ruth._ Well won\u2019t you tell a person what\u2019s happened?\n\n_Hilda._ Mercy Ruth didn\u2019t you hear the screams yourself?\n\n_Kitty._ Where were your ears?\n\n_Ruth._ (_irritated_) You girls make me tired. Can\u2019t you tell me what\nhappened?\n\n_Kitty._ Hope you tell.\n\n_Hope._ Well Aunt Jane went down to the lake with Miss Morgan as she\nsaid she would. Then she took a notion to walk around it. That\u2019s scene\ntwo. Scene three she saw a water lily near the edge that she wanted,\nand she reached for it and slipped in. The water was only a foot deep\nbut of course she got wringing wet. She set up a S. O. S. call or\nwhatever the latest wireless is and Betty and Lucille rushed to the\nrescue. First aid to the injured you know.\n\n_Hilda._ Of course poor Aunt Jane was soaking wet, and then the\nquestion was what to do?\n\n_Ruth._ Couldn\u2019t you girls have gone to the village to get dry clothing\nfrom her suit case?\n\n_Kitty._ Nix. For she had let the chauffeur go to Cherry Valley to see\nhis mother.\n\n_Hope._ Aunt Jane wanted a blanket wrapper, for of course Miss Morgan\u2019s\nclothes wouldn\u2019t fit her.\n\n_Hilda._ Just imagine how hilarious it would be to see Aunty sitting\naround all day in a blanket wrapper and worsted slippers.\n\n_Hope._ But Betty came to the rescue. She actually coaxed Aunt Jane to\naccept the loan of a middy blouse and skirt to wear for the rest of the\nday while her clothes dried in the sun.\n\n_Ruth._ Miss Pickett in a middy blouse. Where\u2019s my Kodak?\n\n_Hope._ Oh we\u2019ve all got to behave ourselves I can tell you, for if we\ndon\u2019t look out Miss Pickett will get so soured on camps, she won\u2019t let\nLucille even mention the word.\n\n_Kitty._ I\u2019ll tell you what we must do. Betty is dressing auntie up in\ncamp clothes, and we must do our best to make her have a nice day, and\nconvert her to the joys of camping. She\u2019s mad as a wet hen now.\n\n_Hope._ Well we\u2019ll all try our best to rejuvenate her and give her a\njolly day.\n\n(_Enter Miss Morgan, Miss Pickett, Betty, Lucille. Miss Pickett is\ndressed ridiculously in middy blouse, too small for her and a short\nskirt._)\n\n_Kitty._ Why Miss Pickett how nice you look!\n\n_Miss Pickett._ Nice in this scandalous costume! I\u2019m glad that the\nLadies Aid Society and the Civic club can\u2019t see me.\n\n_Betty._ Now Aunt Jane\u2014excuse me\u2014but I wish you\u2019d let me call you\nthat\u2014believe me that red is becoming to you, very. Isn\u2019t it girls?\n\n_Miss Morgan._ And the costume is comfortable too.\n\n_Miss Pickett._ Yes I admit that.\n\n_Kitty._ I have a proposition to make, Aunt Jane. Can\u2019t I call you\nthat, too?\n\n_Miss Pickett._ Why yes, you may if you wish.\n\n_Kitty._ Oh lovely! Well this is my idea. You be a regular camper\ntoday, for we want you to see just what jolly good times we have.\n\n_Miss Pickett._ Mercy sakes, do you want me to do high diving and walk\nten miles, and eat fish blackened over a wood fire?\n\n_Ruth._ Oh that isn\u2019t camping. We lead the simple life, not the\nstrenuous one.\n\n_Betty._ I think it would be lovely for her to spend a day just exactly\nas we spend it.\n\n_Ruth._ Go through the whole program you know.\n\n_Miss Morgan._ Well, somewhat modified.\n\n_Hilda._ Our first stunt is putting our tents in order.\n\n_Miss Pickett._ Stunt!\n\n_Ruth._ (_explaining_) Stunt means\u2014well, a task, an accomplishment.\n\n_Kitty._ Hope\u2019s tent is the banner one. It\u2019s all plastered up with\nmottoes.\n\n_Hilda._ I was going to fix up Hope\u2019s bed pie-fashion one time, and\nwhen I hesitated at the door, I saw her motto \u201cDo it now\u201d so I did.\n\n_Miss Pickett._ I am sure I could pass an examination in orderliness.\n\n_Lucille._ Aunt Jane is the most spick and span housekeeper you ever\nsaw.\n\n_Betty._ Well we can put down credits for that then.\n\n_Ruth._ After tent inspection we have a wand drill, to make us\ngraceful. Let\u2019s have that.\n\n_Miss Pickett._ Oh girls you must excuse me from that.\n\n_Betty._ Come Aunt Jane, you\u2019ll enjoy it.\n\n_Hope._ It\u2019s just the thing for sciatica.\n\n_Hilda._ And for nervous dyspepsia.\n\n_Miss Pickett._ Well I suppose I might as well be\u2014\n\n_Betty._ A sport.\n\n_Kitty._ I\u2019ll get the wands and you lead us, Miss Morgan.\n\n_Ruth._ Lucille, you come on too. It\u2019s the same drill we had at school.\n\n(_Wand drill, in which Miss Pickett follows awkwardly the motions of\nthe girls._)\n\n_Betty._ That is fine, you did splendidly. If you did that every day\nyou\u2019d never have nervous dyspepsia.\n\n_Kitty._ Now while we rest we have half an hour for mending.\n\n_Miss Pickett._ Why, do you girls sew up here?\n\n_Miss Morgan._ Certainly they do. They keep their clothing all in good\nrepair.\n\n_Miss Pickett._ I quite approve of that.\n\n_Ruth._ You should see us wash blouses too.\n\n_Hope._ We go down to the lake and pick out a nice flat rock.\n\n_Kitty._ Then we soak our blouses awhile and then scrub them on the\nrock with a nail brush.\n\n_Betty._ And hang them up to dry on the trees\u2014that old tree over there\nusually.\n\n_Miss Pickett._ What a beautiful old oak. I wonder what it would say if\nit could speak.\n\n_Kitty._ (_quietly_) It would probably say \u201cI am a maple.\u201d\n\n_Betty._ Now we\u2019ll consider our mending time done, and next is the\nswimming hour.\n\n_Miss Pickett._ Never.\n\n_Lucille._ I\u2019m crazy to learn to swim Aunt Jane.\n\n_Betty._ Why if you can\u2019t swim you miss half your life and sometimes\nall of it.\n\n_Ruth._ I was down at the swimming pool at home one day and Mrs. Brent,\nshe is terribly rich you know brought down her little dog and told the\nman she wanted her dog to learn to swim. So the man took the doggie and\ntossed him into the pool and doggie paddled back, of course. Then the\nman rubbed him with a Turkish towel, and told Mrs. Brent that was the\nfirst lesson and the charge was fifty cents and to bring the dog twice\na week for six weeks.\n\n_Betty._ Let\u2019s have the land practice Miss Morgan, the way we did when\nwe were learning.\n\n_Miss Pickett._ Land practice?\n\n_Miss Morgan._ The girls are taught the motions of swimming before they\ngo in the water.\n\n_Betty._ Come on, Aunt Jane, this is good for sciatica.\n\n_Ruth._ And nervous dyspepsia.\n\n_Kitty._ Ready for practice girls, form in line.\n\n(_Girls go through land practice in swimming. Miss Pickett following\nawkwardly. This is a sort of gymnastic exercise. Girls wave arms in\nunison as in swimming, using the different strokes, lifting first one\nfoot and then the other, with occasional kicks. Miss Pickett\u2019s efforts\nto follow them can be made very funny._)\n\n_Aunt Jane._ How unspeakably grotesque. I am certainly glad that my\nneighbors and the members of the Civic Club could not see me.\n\n_Lucille._ I think it\u2019s great. I know I could learn to swim real soon.\n\n_Ruth._ But just see how much better you feel.\n\n_Kitty._ Why you have a nice color in your face.\n\n_Hilda._ And your hair is getting wavy all around your face.\n\n_Lucille._ (_aside_) Half the morning gone and Aunt Jane hasn\u2019t\nmentioned nerves. What\u2019s going to happen?\n\n_Miss Morgan._ Now I think our guest had better rest.\n\n_Betty._ Why I was going to propose a hike. Let\u2019s take a tramp to\nBlueberry Hill?\n\n_Miss Pickett._ Dear me, do you have tramps here?\n\n_Miss Morgan._ No indeed, a walk, Betty means.\n\n_Betty._ A hike is the correct term. We pack up a lunch and then go for\na little stroll of ten miles.\n\n_Miss Pickett._ I believe in walking every day, and each morning I walk\nthree blocks to market. The other morning a young bride was doing her\nbuying, and I heard her ask the butcher for an eighth of lamb, as a\nquarter was too much.\n\n_Ruth._ Mother heard a woman complain to the butcher that the lamb was\na little spoiled and the butcher said \u201cNo wonder ma\u2019am that lamb was a\ngreat pet of my children\u2019s and I was afraid they\u2019d spoil it.\u201d\n\n_Betty._ Well Aunt Jane, we can\u2019t give you a credit for hiking on the\nstrength of three blocks to the butchers\u2019 but if you lived with us any\nlength of time we\u2019d have you a champion.\n\n_Kitty._ We aren\u2019t always so strenuous, Miss Pickett. We embroider.\n\n_Hope._ And we do basketry, see what I\u2019m making for mother.\n\n_Ruth._ And we work with raffia, too. Isn\u2019t this a pretty bag?\n\n_Miss Pickett._ Your work is very creditable indeed. My mother when she\nwas a girl made alum baskets and wax flowers, and wreaths from the hair\nof relatives, but these are prettier.\n\n_Lucille._ That\u2019s a compliment. Your basket is prettier than the\ncamelias made from Aunt Susan\u2019s back hair.\n\n_Miss Morgan._ I think you girls are forgetting the most important\nfeature of all.\n\n_Kitty._ (_counting on her fingers_) Hiking, swimming, drill\u2014\n\n_Betty._ Dinner!\n\n_Lucille._ I was hoping some one would mention that.\n\n_Miss Morgan._ Ruth and Hope are the dinner girls this week.\n\n_Ruth._ Well, we\u2019ll try to do ourselves proud. (_Exit with Hope._)\n\n_Miss Pickett._ I confess I am hungry.\n\n_Hilda._ Ruth is our star cook.\n\n_Kitty._ She is economical too. She can make an omelet for ten people\nwith two eggs and a bicycle pump.\n\n_Lucille._ I smell lamb chops.\n\n_Betty._ Yes the girls are broiling them in the cornpopper.\n\n_Miss Pickett._ How resourceful.\n\n_Hope._ (_outside._) Mercy there\u2019s a spider on the custard. Pick it out\nRuth, I\u2019m busy, for there are a dozen ants in the sugar bowl.\n\n_Miss Pickett._ How dreadful.\n\n_Hope._ (_outside._) Oh my nice cream cake.
