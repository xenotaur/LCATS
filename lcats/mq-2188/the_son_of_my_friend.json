    "body": "\n\n\"_I'VE_ been thinking,\" said I, speaking to my husband, who stood\ndrawing on his gloves.\n\n\"Have you?\" he answered; \"then give me the benefit of your\nthoughts.\"\n\n\"That we shall have to give a party. You know we've accepted a\nnumber of invitations this winter, and it's but right that we should\ncontribute our share of social entertainment.\"\n\n\"I have thought as much myself,\" was his reply. \"And so far we stand\nagreed. But, as I am very busy just now, the heaviest part of the\nburden will fall on you.\"\n\n\"There is a way of making it light, you know,\" I returned.\n\n\"How?\" he queried.\n\n\"By employing a professional caterer. He will supply everything for\nthe table, and furnish writers. We will have nothing to do but\nreceive our guests.\"\n\nMy husband shrugged his shoulders and smiled, as he said, \"What will\nit cost?\"\n\n\"Almost anything we please. But the size of the company will have\nthe most to do with that.\"\n\n\"Say we invite one hundred.\"\n\n\"Then we can make the cost range anywhere between three hundred\ndollars and a thousand.\"\n\n\"A large sum to throw away on a single evening's entertainment of\nour friends. I am very sure I could put it to a better use.\"\n\n\"Very likely,\" I answered. \"Still, we cannot well help ourselves.\nUnless we give a party, we shall have to decline invitations in\nfuture. But there is no obligation resting on us to make it\nsensational. Let the Hardings and the Marygolds emulate extravagance\nin this line; we must be content with a fair entertainment; and no\nfriend worth the name will have any the less respect for us.\"\n\n\"All that is a question of money and good fame,\" said my husband,\nhis voice falling into a more serious tone. \"I can make it three,\nfive, or ten hundred dollars, and forget all about the cost in a\nweek. But the wine and the brandy will not set so easily on my\nconscience.\"\n\nA slight but sudden chill went through my nerves.\n\n\"If we could only throw them out?\"\n\n\"There is no substitute,\" replied my husband, \"that people in our\ncircle would accept. If we served coffee, tea, and chocolate\ninstead, we would be laughed at.\"\n\n\"Not by the fathers and mothers, I think. At least not by those who\nhave grown-up-sons,\" I returned. \"Only last week I heard Mrs. Gordon\nsay that cards for a party always gave her a fit of low spirits. She\nhas three sons, you know.\"\n\n\"Rather fast young men, as the phrase is. I've noticed them in\nsupper-rooms, this winter, several times. A little too free with the\nwine.\"\n\nWe both stood silent for the space of nearly a minute.\n\n\"Well, Agnes,\" said my husband, breaking the silence, \"how are we to\ndecide this matter?\"\n\n\"We must give a party, or decline invitations in future,\" I replied.\n\n\"Which shall it be?\" His eyes looked steadily into mine. I saw that\nthe thing troubled him.\n\n\"Turn it in your thought during the day, and we'll talk it over this\nevening,\" said I.\n\nAfter tea my husband said, laying down the newspaper he had been\nreading and looking at me across the centre-table, \"What about the\nparty, Agnes?\"\n\n\"We shall have to give it, I suppose.\" We must drop out of the\nfashionable circle in which I desired to remain; or do our part in\nit. I had thought it all over--looking at the dark side and at the\nbright side--and settled the question. I had my weaknesses as well\nas others. There was social eclat in a party, and I wanted my share.\n\n\"Wine, and brandy, and all?\" said my husband.\n\n\"We cannot help ourselves. It is the custom of society; and society\nis responsible, not we.\"\n\n\"There is such a thing as individual responsibility,\" returned my\nhusband. \"As to social responsibility, it is an intangible thing;\nvery well to talk about, but reached by no law, either of conscience\nor the statute-book. You and I, and every other living soul, must\nanswer to God for what we do. No custom or law of society will save\nus from the consequences of our own acts. So far we stand alone.\"\n\n\"But if society bind us to a certain line of action, what are we to\ndo? Ignore society?\"\n\n\"If we must ignore society or conscience, what then?\"\n\nHis calm eyes were on my face. \"I'm afraid,\" said I, \"that you are\nmagnifying this thing into an undue importance.\"\n\nHe sighed heavily, and dropped his eyes away from mine. I watched\nhis countenance, and saw the shadows of uneasy thought gathering\nabout his lips and forehead.\n\n\"It is always best,\" he remarked, \"to consider the probable\nconsequences of what we intend doing. If we give this party, one\nthing is certain.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That boys and young men, some of them already in the ways that lead\nto drunkenness and ruin, will be enticed to drink. We will put\ntemptation to their lips and smilingly invite them to taste its\ndangerous sweets. By our example we will make drinking respectable.\nIf we serve wine and brandy to our guests, young and old, male and\nfemale, what do we less than any dram-seller in the town? Shall we\ncondemn him, and ourselves be blameless? Do we call his trade a\nsocial evil of the direst character, and yet ply our guests with the\nsame tempting stimulants that his wretched customers crowd his\nbar-room to obtain?\"\n\nI was borne down by the weight of what my husband said. I saw the\nevil that was involved in this social use of wines and liquors which\nhe so strongly condemned. But, alas that I must say it! neither\nprinciple nor conscience were strong enough to overcome my weak\ndesire to keep in good standing with my fashionable friends. I\nwanted to give a party--I felt that I must give a party. Gladly\nwould I have dispensed with liquor; but I had not the courage to\ndepart from the regular order of things. So I decided to give the\nparty.\n\n\"Very well, Agnes,\" said my husband, when the final decision was\nmade. \"If the thing has to be done, let it be well and liberally\ndone.\"\n\nI had a very dear friend--a Mrs. Martindale. As school-girls, we\nwere warmly attached to each other, and as we grew older our\nfriendship became closer and tenderer. Marriage, that separates so\nmany, did not separate us. Our lots were cast in the same city, and\nin the same social circle. She had an only son, a young man of fine\nintellect and much promise, in whom her life seemed bound up. He\nwent into the army at an early period of the war, and held the rank\nof second lieutenant; conducting himself bravely. A slight, but\ndisabling wound sent him home a short time previous to the surrender\nof Lee, and before he was well enough to join his regiment, it was\nmustered out of service.\n\nAlbert Martindale left his home, as did thousands of other young\nmen, with his blood untouched by the fire of alcohol, and returned\nfrom the war, as thousands of other young men returned, with its\nsubtle poison in all his veins.\n\nThe dread of this very thing had haunted his mother during all the\nyears of his absence in the army.\n\n\"Oh, Agnes,\" she had often said to me, with eyes full of tears, \"it\nis not the dread of his death that troubles me most. I have tried to\nadjust that sad event between myself and God. In our fearful crisis\nhe belongs to his country. I could not withhold him, though my heart\nseemed breaking when I let him go. I live in the daily anticipation\nof a telegram announcing death or a terrible wound. Yet that is not\nthe thing of fear I dread; but something worse--his moral defection.\nI would rather he fell in battle than come home to me with manhood\nwrecked. What I most dread is intemperance. There is so much\ndrinking among officers. It is the curse of our army. I pray that he\nmay escape; yet weep, and tremble, and fear while I pray. Oh, my\nfriend I think his fall into this terrible vice would kill me.\"\n\nAlas for my friend! Her son came home to her with tainted breath and\nfevered blood. It did not kill her. Love held her above despair, and\ngave her heart a new vitality. She must be a savior; not a weak\nmourner over wrecked hopes.\n\nWith what a loving care and wise discretion did she set herself to\nwork to withdraw her son from the dangerous path in which his feet\nwere walking! and she would have been successful, but for one thing.\nThe customs of society were against her. She could not keep him away\nfrom the parties and evening entertainments of her friends; and here\nall the good resolutions she had led him to make were as flax fibres\nin the flame of a candle. He had no strength to resist when wine\nsparkled and flashed all around him, and bright eyes and ruby lips\ninvited him to drink. It takes more than ordinary firmness of\nprinciple to abstain in a fashionable company of ladies and\ngentlemen, where wine and brandy flow as water. In the case of\nAlbert Martindale, two things were against him. He was not strong\nenough to set himself against any tide of custom, in the first\nplace; and in the second, he had the allurement of appetite.\n\nI knew all this, when, with my own hand, I wrote on one of our cards\nof invitation, \"Mr. and Mrs. Martindale and family;\" but did not\nthink of it, until the card was written. As I laid it aside with the\nrest, the truth flashed on me and sent a thrill of pain along every\nnerve. My heart grew sick and my head faint, as thoughts of the evil\nthat might come to the son of my friend, in consequence of the\ntemptation I was about to throw in his way, rushed through my mind.\nMy first idea was to recall the card, and I lifted it from the table\nwith a half-formed resolution to destroy it. But a moment's\nreflection changed this purpose. I could not give a large\nentertainment and leave out my nearest friend and her family.\n\nThe pain and wild agitation of that moment were dreadful. I think\nall good spirits and angels that could get near my conscious life\nstrove with me, for the sake of a soul in peril, to hold me back\nfrom taking another step in the way I was going; for it was not yet\ntoo late to abandon the party.\n\nWhen, after a long struggle with right convictions, I resumed my\nwork of filling up the cards of invitation, I had such a blinding\nheadache that I could scarcely see the letters my pen was forming;\nand when the task was done, I went to bed, unable to bear up against\nthe double burden of intense bodily and mental anguish.\n\nThe cards went out, and the question of the party was settled beyond\nrecall. But that did not soothe the disquietude of my spirit. I felt\nthe perpetual burden of a great and troubling responsibility. Do\nwhat I would, there was for me no ease of mind. Waking or sleeping,\nthe thought of Albert Martindale and his mother haunted me\ncontinually.\n\nAt last the evening came, and our guests began to arrive, in party\ndresses and party faces, richly attired, smiling and gracious. Among\nthe earliest were Mr. and Mrs. Martindale, their son and daughter.\n\nThe light in my friend's eyes, as we clasped hands and looked into\neach other's faces, did not conceal the shadows of anxious fear that\nrested on them. As I held Albert's hand, and gazed at him for a\nmoment, a pang shot through my heart. Would he go out as pure and\nmanly as he had come in? Alas, no! for I had made provision for his\nfall.\n\nThe company was large and fashionable. I shall not attempt a\ndescription of the dresses, nor venture an estimate touching the\nvalue of diamonds. I have no heart for this. No doubt the guests\nenjoyed themselves to the degree usual on such occasions. I cannot\nsay as much for at, least one of the hosts. In the supper-room stood\na table, the sight of which had smitten my eyes with pain. Its image\nwas perpetually before me. All the evening, while my outward eyes\nlooked into happy faces, my inward gaze rested gloomily on decanters\nof brandy and bottles of wine crowding the supper-table, to which I\nwas soon to invite the young men--mere boys, some of them--and\nmaidens, whose glad voices filled the air of my drawing-rooms.\n\nI tried to console myself by the argument that I was only doing as\nthe rest did--following a social custom; and that society was\nresponsible--not the individual. But this did not lift the weight of\nconcern and self-condemnation that so heavily oppressed me.\n\nAt last word came that all was ready in the supper-room. The hour\nwas eleven. Our guests passed in to where smoking viands, rich\nconfectionery and exhilarating draughts awaited them. We had\nprepared a liberal entertainment, a costly feast of all available\ndelicacies. Almost the first sound that greeted my ears after\nentering the supper-room was the \"pop\" of a champagne cork. I looked\nin the direction from whence it came, and saw a bottle in the hands\nof Albert Martindale. A little back from the young man stood his\nmother. Our eyes met. Oh, the pain and reproach in the glance of my\nfriend! I could not bear it, but turned my face away.\n\nI neither ate nor drank anything. The most tempting dish had no\nallurement for my palate, and I shivered at the thought of tasting\nwine. I was strangely and unnaturally disturbed; yet forced to\ncommend myself and be affable and smiling to our guests.\n\n\"Observe Mrs. Gordon,\" I heard a lady near me say in a low voice to\nher companion.\n\n\"What of her?\" was returned.\n\n\"Follow the direction of her eyes.\"\n\nI did so, as well as the ladies near me, and saw that Mrs. Gordon\nwas looking anxiously at one of her sons, who was filling his glass\nfor, it might be, the second or third time.\n\n\"It is no place for that young man,\" one of them remarked. \"I pity\nhis mother. Tom is a fine fellow at heart, and has a bright mind;\nbut he is falling into habits that will, I fear, destroy him. I\nthink he has too much self-respect to visit bar-rooms frequently;\nbut an occasion like this gives him a liberty that is freely used to\nhis hurt. It is all very respectable; and the best people set an\nexample he is too ready to follow.\"\n\nI heard no more, but that was quite enough to give my nerves a new\nshock and fill my heart with a new disquietude. A few minutes\nafterwards I found myself at the side of Mrs. Gordon. To a remark\nthat I made she answered in an absent kind of way, as though the\nmeaning of what I said did not reach her thought. She looked past\nme; I followed her eyes with mine, and saw her youngest boy, not yet\neighteen, with a glass of champagne to his lips. He was drinking\nwith a too apparent sense of enjoyment. The sigh that passed the\nmother's lips smote my ears with accusation. \"Mrs. Carleton!\" A\nfrank, cheery voice dropped into my ear. It was that of Albert\nMartindale, the son of my friend. He was handsome, and had a free,\nwinning manner. I saw by the flush in his cheeks, and the gleam in\nhis eyes, that wine had already quickened the flow of blood in his\nveins.\n\n\"You are enjoying yourself,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh, splendidly!\" then bending to my ear, he added.--\"You've given\nthe finest entertainment of the season.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" I whispered, raising my finger. Then added, in a warning\ntone--\"Enjoy it in moderation, Albert.\"\n\nHis brows knit slightly. The crowd parted us, and we did not meet\nagain during the evening.\n\nBy twelve o'clock, most of the ladies had withdrawn from the\nsupper-room; but the enticement of wine held too many of the men\nthere--young and old. Bursts of coarse laughter, loud exclamations,\nand snatches of song rang out from the company in strange confusion.\nIt was difficult to realize that the actors in this scene of revelry\nwere gentlemen, and gentlemen's sons, so called, and not the coarse\nfrequenters of a corner tavern.\n\nGuests now began to withdraw quietly. It was about half-past twelve\nwhen Mrs. Martindale came down from the dressing-room, with her\ndaughter, and joined Mr. Martindale in the hall, where he had been\nwaiting for them.\n\n\"Where is Albert?\" I heard the mother ask.\n\n\"In the supper-room, I presume; I've looked for him in the parlors,\"\nMr. Martindale answered.\n\n\"I will call him for you,\" I said, coming forward.\n\n\"Oh, do if you please,\" my friend replied. There was a husky tremor\nin her voice.\n\nI went to the supper-room. All the ladies had retired, and the door\nwas shut. What a scene for a gentleman's house presented itself!\nCigars had been lighted, and the air was thick with smoke. As I\npushed open the door, my ear was fairly stunned by the confusion of\nsounds. There was a hush of voices, and I saw bottles from many\nhands set quickly upon the table, and glasses removed from lips\nalready too deeply stained with wine. With three or four exceptions,\nall of this company were young men and boys. Near the door was the\nperson I sought.\n\n\"Albert!\" I called; and the young man came forward. His face was\ndarkly flushed, and his eyes red and glittering.\n\n\"Albert, your mother is going,\" I said.\n\n\"Give her my compliments,\" he answered, with an air of mock\ncourtesy, \"and tell her that she has my gracious permission.\"\n\n\"Come!\" I urged; \"she is waiting for you.\"\n\nHe shook his head resolutely. \"I'm not going for an hour, Mrs.\nCarleton. Tell mother not to trouble herself. I'll be home in good\ntime.\"\n\nI urged him, but in vain.\n\n\"Tell him that he _must_ come!\" Mrs. Martindale turned on her\nhusband an appealing look of distress, when I gave her Albert's\nreply.\n\nBut the father did not care to assert an authority which might not\nbe heeded, and answered, \"Let him enjoy himself with the rest. Young\nblood beats quicker than old.\"\n\nThe flush of excited feeling went out of Mrs. Martindale's face. I\nsaw it but for an instant after this reply from her husband; but\nlike a sun-painting, its whole expression was transferred to a leaf\nof memory, where it is as painfully vivid now as on that\nnever-to-be-forgotten evening. It was pale and convulsed, and the\neyes full of despair. A dark presentiment of something terrible had\nfallen upon her--the shadow of an approaching woe that was to burden\nall her life.\n\nMy friend passed out from my door, and left me so wretched that I\ncould with difficulty rally my feelings to give other parting guests\na pleasant word. Mrs. Gordon had to leave in her carriage without\nher sons, who gave no heed to the repeated messages she sent to\nthem.\n\nAt last, all the ladies were gone; but there still remained a dozen\nyoung men in the supper-room, from whence came to my ears a\nsickening sound of carousal. I sought my chamber, and partly\ndisrobing threw myself on a bed. Here I remained in a state of\nwretchedness impossible to describe for over an hour, when my\nhusband came in.\n\n\"Are they all gone?\" I asked, rising.\n\n\"All, thank God!\" he answered, with a sigh of relief. Then, after a\nmoment's pause, he said--\"If I live a thousand years, Agnes, the\nscene of to-night shall never be repeated in my house! I feel not\nonly a sense of disgrace, but worse--a sense of guilt! What have we\nbeen doing? Giving our influence and our money to help in the works\nof elevating and refining society? or in the work of corrupting and\ndebasing it? Are the young men who left our house a little while\nago, as strong for good as when they came in? Alas! alas! that we\nmust answer, No! What if Albert Martindale were our son?\"\n\nThis last sentence pierced me as if it had been a knife.\n\n\"He went out just now,\" continued Mr. Carleton, \"so much intoxicated\nthat he walked straight only by an effort.\"\n\n\"Why did you let him go?\" I asked, fear laying suddenly its cold\nhand on my heart. \"What if harm should come to him?\"\n\n\"The worst harm will be a night at the station house, should he\nhappen to get into a drunken brawl on his way home,\" my husband\nreplied.\n\nI shivered as I murmured, \"His poor mother!\"\n\n\"I thought of her,\" replied Mr. Carleton, \"as I saw him depart just\nnow, and said to myself bitterly, 'To think of sending home from my\nhouse to his mother a son in that condition!' And he was not the\nonly one!\"\n\nWe were silent after that. Our hearts were so heavy that we could\nnot talk. It was near daylight before I slept, and then my dreams\nwere of so wild and strange a character that slumber was brief and\nunrefreshing.\n\nThe light came dimly in through half-drawn curtains on the next\nmorning when a servant knocked at my door.\n\n\"What is wanted?\" I asked.\n\n\"Did Mr. Albert Martindale sleep here last night?\"\n\nI sprang from my bed, strangely agitated, and partly opening the\nchamber door, said, in a voice whose unsteadiness I could not\ncontrol, \"Why do you ask, Katy? Who wants to know?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Martindale has sent to inquire. The girl says he didn't come\nhome last night.\"\n\n\"Tell her that he left our house about two o'clock,\" I replied; and\nshutting the chamber door, staggered back to the bed and fell across\nit, all my strength gone for the moment.\n\n\"Send her word to inquire at one of the police stations,\" said my\nhusband, bitterly.\n\nI did not answer, but lay in a half stupor, under the influence of\nbenumbing mental pain. After a while I arose, and, looking out, saw\neverything clothed in a white mantle, and the snow falling in large\nflakes, heavily but silently, through the still air. How the sight\nchilled me. That the air was piercing cold, I knew by the delicate\nfrost-pencilings all over the window panes.\n\nAfter breakfast, I sent to Mrs. Martindale a note of inquiry about\nAlbert. A verbal answer came from the distracted mother, saying that\nhe was still absent, and that inquiry of the police had failed to\nbring any intelligence in regard to him. It was still hoped that he\nhad gone home with some friend, and would return during the day.\n\nSteadily the snow continued to fall, and as the wind had risen since\nmorning, it drifted heavily. By ten o'clock it was many inches deep,\nand there was no sign of abatement. My suspense and fear were so\noppressive that, in spite of the storm, I dressed myself and went\nout to call on my friend. I found her in her chamber, looking very\npale, and calmer than I had hoped to find her. But the calmness I\nsoon saw to be a congelation of feeling. Fear of the worst had\nfrozen the wild waves into stillness.\n\n\"God knows best,\" she said, in a voice so sad that its tones ached\nthrough my heart. \"We are all in His hands. Pray for me, Agnes, that\nI may have strength. If He does not give me strength, I shall die.\"\n\nI shivered; for both in voice and look were signs of wavering\nreason. I tried to comfort her with suggestions as to where Albert\nmight be. \"No doubt,\" I said, \"he went home with a friend, and we\nmay look any moment for his return. Why should the absence of a few\nhours so alarm you?\"\n\nThere was a stony glare in her eyes as she shook her head silently.\nShe arose, and walking to the window, stood for several minutes\nlooking out upon the snow. I watched her closely. She was motionless\nas marble. After awhile I saw a quick shudder run through her frame.\nThen she turned and came slowly back to the lounge from which she\nhad risen, and lay down quietly, shutting her eyes. Oh, the still\nanguish of that pale, pinched face! Shall I ever be able to draw a\nveil over its image in my mind?\n\nSuddenly she started up. Her ear had caught the sound of the street\nbell which had just been rung. She went hurriedly to the chamber\ndoor, opened it, and stood out in the upper hall, listening.\n\n\"Who is it?\" she asked, in a hoarse, eager under tone, as a servant\ncame up after answering the bell.\n\n\"Mrs. Gordon's man. He called to ask if we'd heard anything from Mr.\nAlbert yet.\"\n\nMrs. Martindale came back into her chamber with a whiter face and\nunsteady steps, not replying. The servant stood looking after her\nwith a countenance in which doubt and pity were mingled; then turned\nand went down stairs.\n\nI did not go home until evening. All day the snow fell drearily, and\nthe wind sighed and moaned along the streets, or shrieked painfully\nacross sharp angles, or rattled with wild, impatience the loose\nshutters that obstructed its way. Every hour had its breathless\nsuspense or nervous excitement. Messengers came and went\nperpetually. As the news of Albert's prolonged absence spread among\nhis friends and the friends of the family, the circle of search and\ninquiry became larger and the suspense greater. To prevent the\nalmost continual ringing of the bell, it was muffled, and a servant\nstationed by the door to receive or answer all who came.\n\nNight dropped down, shutting in with a strange suddenness, as some\nheavier clouds darkened the west. Up to this period not a single\nitem of intelligence from the absent one had been gained since, as\nrelated by one of the young Gordons, he parted from him between two\nand three o'clock in the morning, and saw him take his way down one\nof the streets, not far from his home, leading to the river. It was\nsnowing fast at the time, and the ground was already well covered.\nCloser questioning of the young man revealed the fact that Albert\nMartindale was, at the time, so much intoxicated that he could not\nwalk steadily.\n\n\"I looked after him,\" said Gordon, \"as he left me, and saw him\nstagger from side to side; but in a few moments the snow and\ndarkness hid him from sight. He was not far from home, and would, I\nhad no doubt, find his way there.\"\n\nNothing beyond this was ascertained on the first day of his absence.\nI went home soon after dark, leaving Mrs. Martindale with other\nfriends. The anguish I was suffering no words can tell. Not such\nanguish as pierced the mother's heart; but, in one degree sharper,\nin that guilt and responsibility were on my conscience.\n\nThree days went by. He had vanished and left no sign! The whole\npolice of the city sought for him, but in vain. Their theory was\nthat he had missed his home, and wandered on towards the docks,\nwhere he had been robbed and murdered and his body cast into the\nriver. He had on his person a valuable gold watch, and a diamond pin\nworth over two hundred dollars--sufficient temptation for robbery\nand murder if his unsteady feet had chanced to bear him into that\npart of the city lying near the river.\n\nAll hope of finding Albert alive was abandoned after a week's\nagonizing suspense, and Mr. Martindale offered a reward of five\nhundred dollars for the recovery of his son's body. Stimulated by\nthis offer, hundreds of boatmen began the search up and down the\nrivers and along the shores of the bay, leaving no point unvisited\nwhere the body might have been borne by the tides. But over large\nportions of this field ice had formed on the surface, closing up\nmany small bays and indentations of the land. There were hundreds of\nplaces into any one of which the body might have floated, and where\nit must remain until the warm airs of spring set the water free\nagain. The search was fruitless.\n\nMrs. Martindale, meantime, had lapsed into a state of dull\nindifference to everything but her great sorrow. That absorbed her\nwhole mental life. It was the house in which her soul dwelt, the\nchamber of affliction wherein she lived, and moved, and had her\nbeing--so darkly draped that no light came in through the windows.\nVery still and passionless she sat here, refusing to be comforted.\n\nForced by duty, yet dreading always to look into her face, that\nseemed full of accusations, I went often to see my friend. It was\nvery plain that, in her mind, I was an accessory to her son's death.\nNot after the first few days did I venture to offer a word of\ncomfort; for such words from my lips seemed as mockery. They\nfaltered on my tongue.\n\nOne day I called and the servant took up my name. On returning to\nthe parlor, she said that Mrs. Martindale did not feel very well,\nand wished to be excused. The servant's manner confirmed my instant\nsuspicion. I had looked for this; yet was not the pang it gave me\nless acute for the anticipation? Was I not the instrumental cause of\na great calamity that had wrecked her dearest hope in life? And how\ncould she bear to see my face?\n\nI went home very heavy-hearted. My husband tried to comfort me with\nwords that had no balm for either his troubled heart or mine. The\ngreat fact of our having put the cup of confusion to that young\nman's lips, and sent him forth at midnight in no condition to find\nhis way home, stood out too sharply defined for any self-delusion.\n\nI did not venture to the house of my friend again. She had dropped a\ncurtain between us, and I said, \"It shall be a wall of separation.\"\n\nNot until spring opened was the body of Albert Martindale recovered.\nIt was found floating in the dock, at the end of the street down\nwhich young Gordon saw him go with unsteady steps in the darkness\nand storm on that night of sorrow. His watch was in his pocket, the\nhands pointing to half-past two, the time, in all probability, when\nhe fell into the water. The diamond pin was in his scarf, and his\npocket-book in his pocket, unrifled. He had not been robbed and\nmurdered. So much was certain. To all it was plain that the\nbewildered young man, left to himself, had plunged on blindly\nthrough the storm, going he knew not whither, until he reached the\nwharf. The white sheet of snow lying over everything hid from eyes\nlike his the treacherous margin, and he stepped, unheeding, to his\ndeath! It was conjectured that his body had floated, by an incoming\ntide, under the wharf, and that his clothes had caught in the logs\nand held it there for so long a time.\n\nCertainty is always better than doubt. On the Sunday after the\nsaddest funeral it has ever been my lot to attend, Mrs. Martindale\nappeared for the first time in church. I did not see her face, for\nshe kept her heavy black veil closely drawn. On the following Sunday\nshe was in the family pew again, but still kept her face hidden.\nFrom friends who visited her (I did not call again after my first\ndenial) I learned that she had become calm and resigned.\n\nTo one of these friends she said, \"It is better that he should have\ndied than live to be what I too sadly fear our good society would\nhave made him--a social burden and disgrace. But custom and example\nwere all against him. It was at the house of one of my oldest and\ndearest friends that wine enticed him. The sister of my heart put\nmadness in his brain, and then sent him forth to meet a death he had\nno skill left to avoid.\"\n\nOh, how these sentences cut and bruised and pained my heart, already\ntoo sore to bear my own thoughts without agony!\n\nWhat more shall I write? Is not this unadorned story sad enough, and\nfull enough of counsel and warning? Far sooner would I let it sleep,\nand go farther and farther away into the oblivion of past events;\nbut the times demand a startling cry of warning. And so, out of the\ndark depths of the saddest experience of my life, I have brought\nthis grief, and shame, and agony to the light, and let it stand\nshivering in the face of all men.",
