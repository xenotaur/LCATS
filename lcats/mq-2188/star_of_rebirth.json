    "body": "Everyone should have known. They should have known as surely as though\nit were written in the curved palm of the wind. They should have known\nwhen they looked up at the empty sky; they should have known when they\nlooked down at the hungry children. Yet somehow they did not know that\ntheir last migratory hunt was almost over.\n\nThe straggling band had woven its slow trail among the mountains for\nforty days of vanishing hopes and shrinking stomachs. Ahead of the main\nparty, the scouts had crawled until their knees and palms were raw; but\nstill there was no track of game, and the only scent was that of the\npungent air that rose from the ragged peaks of ice.\n\nAt last they halted, only a few footsteps from The Cave of the Fallen\nSun, the farthest western reach of their frozen domain. In the rear\nof the column the women threatened the children into silence and the\nscouts went first to the mouth of the cave to look for signs of an\nanimal having entered. Presently the scouts stood up with their massive\nshoulders drooping, turned to the rest and made a hopeless gesture.\n\nAtanta, who stood alone and motionless between the scouts and the\nrest of his band, knew that all were waiting for him to use his\nmagic to make a great leopard appear in the empty cave. \"A _very_\ngreat leopard,\" he thought sarcastically. Enough to feed them all\nfor a hundred days. A leopard so huge it would whine pitifully while\nthey killed it. A leopard so gigantic that it would not leave its\nfootprints in the snow. Indeed, Atanta was sure, the leopard his people\nwanted would be much too large to fit into the cave. Well, perhaps\nthere would be a bird.\n\nHe held himself very tall and straight so that his dejection might not\nshow to either his people or his gods. But after forty days of the\ntrackless hunt, Atanta felt with certainty that the gods were deaf or\ndead ... or at least very far away.\n\nThe sun was hot and the gods were gone, and he would not keep his\npeople waiting with false hopes. He closed his eyes and took up the\ncrude bone cross that hung from his waist, and he cursed the gods with\nsilent venom. And when his chastisement of the delinquent gods was\ndone, he dropped the cross to dangle at his waist again.\n\nTwo hunters moved stealthily forward, their spears disappearing before\nthem into the cave. It was somehow pathetic, Atanta felt, the way they\nmoved so courageously into the empty darkness.\n\nHow many caves had there been, Atanta wondered, since they left the\nmouth of the river? Fully a dozen, always empty, except for the\nscattered bones of bears and men. Perhaps he should have kept his\npeople at the river. No, he told himself. He had done the only thing\nhe could do. The season had been bad and their meager catch of fish\ncarefully stored. But the already heavy ice thickened with the approach\nof winter and made fishing almost impossible. When their supplies were\nalmost gone, he had done as so many had done before him. He had led his\npeople on the futile hunt, hoping for the miracle of a dozen sleeping\nbears or a great white leopard. Such miracles had happened in the past.\nOnce he had gone with his father on such a winter hunt.\n\nBut miracles without footprints were quite another matter. That was the\nway his people lived: just existing when the catch was good, starving\nwhen it was not.\n\nPresently the two hunters stepped out of the darkness with the blunt\nends of their spears dragging behind them, and their countenances told\nthe others that the cave was indeed empty.\n\nChildren began to cry. Women picked up their packs and slung them\nacross their shoulders. The men mumbled inaudible words that turned\ninto whisps of smoke in the icy air. At Atanta's signal, everyone\nentered the ice-floored cave, thankful at least to be out of the\nblinding brightness of the sun and snow, and into the soothing dark\nwhere they could rest.\n\nAtanta stood while his people stretched their furry bodies out over\nthe frozen ground. He looked down at his woman who lay before him,\nwatching him with her black eyes large and warm. It made his stomach\nclutch itself into an angry knot, to see her young face so drawn with\nexhaustion and hunger. There were lines in her face he had never seen\nbefore; the fur of her head and body had lost its sheen and was now\nbrittle and dry. She patted the ice and motioned him to lie down beside\nher; but he turned his eyes away from her, because he knew that he must\ntell the others before he could rest.\n\n\"Listen to me,\" he said, and his voice rang through the ice-sheeted\ncave. The tired eyes of the men and women opened and everyone sat up.\n\nHow should he tell them? They were waiting now. Should he simply say\nit swiftly and have done with it? Tell them that they had followed an\nimpotent god until now they were to die? Surely he should prepare them\nsomehow. Prepare them for the importance of what he was to say.\n\n\"Listen, for I tell you of the end of the empty caves.\"\n\nHe stood silent for a moment watching hope filter into their faces,\nhope that made their dull eyes shine in the semi-darkness.\n\n\"Do not let joy curl your lips until you have listened, for it would be\na false joy.\"\n\nThe lines of tiredness and worry returned to the faces about him.\nAtanta did not look down at his woman's face, for she knew him very\nwell and she would know what he had to do.\n\n\n\n\"We are told of a time long ago, when the cave of man was filled with\nfood as the night is filled with stars, and the caves and the men\ncovered the five corners of the world. But these were not the caves\nthat we know now. They were magic caves, and these were magic men. The\nmen of that long-ago world created the very mountains into which they\ndug their caves. The mountains they created raised their peaks through\nthe highest clouds, and every mountain held countless caves ... caves\nstuffed with bear and fish and captive winter winds. These were magic\ntimes when every man was a priest. Every man could make fire blossom\nfrom nowhere and every man could fly through the air like a bird.\n\n\"All this was long ago when the world was young, and the world was\nhot, and our people could live in the heat. But Nuomo the God of Night\nbecame jealous of these magic men, for he had seen them fly into the\nnight itself in search of the stars. And so Nuomo wrapped his black\nwings around the world and shook it for ten tens of days. The world\ncracked and burst with flame that sprouted up into the darkened sky.\nThe people ran in terror and their mountain-caves were sucked down into\nthe earth or burned into ash by the flame. At the end of the ten tens\nof days, Nuomo thought that all were dead and so he rolled a sheet of\nice across the earth to cool it.\n\n\"Only one man was able to escape the wrath of that ancient god. He was\nan old man with only little magic and he felt himself on the edge of\ndeath. He look from his body a rib which he fashioned into a son. But\nhe made the son in such a way that he could live upon the ice itself,\nas we do now.\n\n\"The son knew that the old man was about to die, and so he said:\n'Father, use your magic to make a woman to keep me from being lonely.'\n\n\"'Woman!' the old man cried. 'I should think you would want me to teach\nyou the use of magic.'\n\n\"'Yes, father,' the son answered, 'if you can.'\n\n\"'No,' the old man told him. 'I am so near to death there is no time. A\nwoman will have to do.'\n\n\"And so the old man drew from his chest another rib which he fashioned\ninto a woman. This being done, he turned to his son and said: 'My son,\nthe time has come for me to die. Do not mourn for me, for when each\nevening comes you will see my home--the red star which travels quickly\nin the night. For many ten tens of years, I have been preparing it to\nbecome a suitable place to be born again. When your time comes, you too\nwill be welcome there.'\n\n\"Thus saying, the old man placed his hands upon the shoulders of his\nson. Then he wrapped his cloak about him and rose up into the heavens\nto the star of rebirth.\n\n\"Only when the old man had gone to the star of rebirth, did the son\nturn to his woman. Only then did he see that she had not been made in\nhis image, for she was hairless and delicate and not made to live upon\nthe ice. She was a Hotland woman. But the son, whose name was Dectar,\ntook his woman whose name was Sontia, shielded her from the icy winds\nand comforted her as best he could. Some of their children had hair\nand loved the cold; some were weak and hairless and did not. In those\ndays the hunting was good and the strong sheltered the weak, fed them,\ncarried them on the long hunts. But Sontia was a jealous woman. Jealous\nof her strong husband and their offspring of his kind. She prayed\nto Ram, God of the Sun, and begged him to melt the ice. And so the\nice began to melt, leaving the Hotlands a paradise for weak selfish\ncreatures. Sontia deserted Dectar, taking with her those of their\nchildren who were hairless and weak like herself.\n\n\"When the ice began to melt, we sons of Dectar were forced to hunt\nfarther northward year by year. The game became not so plentiful as it\nhad been. Our people learned to fish and hunt as we do now--to fish in\nthe summer, to hunt when the ice becomes thick.\n\n\"But the jealous sons of Sontia who swarm in the Hotlands were not\ncontent to see us perish year by year. Even to this day, if we should\nwander down to the edge of their domain to beg for a few scraps of\nfood, they would answer our plea with death. And even in death they\nwould allow us no dignity, but would strip us of our hides and wear\nthem in mockery.\n\n\"I tell you of this now, because when a man comes on a long hunt which\nends in an empty cave, it is well to remember and be proud of the\nsuccessful hunts of other years.\"\n\nAtanta took the white bone cross carefully from about his waist.\n\n\"It was I who first saw this god go across the sky.\" He held up the\ncross for all to see. \"It went slowly like a bird from horizon to\nhorizon and I knew that it was not a bird for it did not flap its\nwings, but kept them still and outstretched. I believed it to be the\ngod who would fill our hunting trails with game, but now I know that\nthis god is impotent. At worst it is a foolish god, lying somewhere on\nthe white floating ice of heaven, wallowing in idleness while my people\nstarve.\"\n\nHe dropped the cross to the smooth ice floor, knelt and smashed the\ncross into pieces with one swift blow of his hammerstone.\n\nWhen he looked up the people were silent and unmoving. Perhaps he had\nbeen a fool. Perhaps he had told them nothing they didn't know. Perhaps\nthey had already given up and knew that they would die here in the cave\nand that he could produce no magic to help them.\n\n\"Will you take another god?\" one of the scouts asked.\n\n\"I see no other god to take.\"\n\n\"Then do you think we can be delivered without a god?\"\n\nWasn't it evident? Surely they must know. Should he tell them there was\nno deliverance, with or without a god?\n\n\"I don't know,\" he lied. \"I don't know.\"\n\nArk's woman drew a strip of leather from the mouth of a sleeping child\nand put it in her own mouth. \"Then you'll have to deliver us yourself,\"\nshe said and lay down to go to sleep.\n\nA sudden rage burned in Atanta's brain. The muscles in his square jaw\ntrembled as he glared at the sprawling furry figures, who would lie\nthere and die while they waited like children for him to provide for\nthe future.\n\nAbruptly he turned and left the cave, and walked out under the yellow\nsun that made the ice-covered mountains shimmer. He felt that he must\nget away from them. He did not want to die with fools.\n\n\n\nThe sun blazed hot upon the hair of his head and back as he traveled\nrapidly downward and away from his people in the cave. He traveled too\nquickly to think of anything else but where his next footstep should\nbe, and within an hour he was at the edge of a great ice field that\nstretched itself out before him like the footprint of a giant. There\ncould be no more swift traveling now. Cautiously, he started out over\nthe empty plain, prodding the ice before him with his spear.\n\nIt was not that they were children. He knew that he had been wrong to\njudge them so. There was nothing they could do. They had walked their\nlives away on the long hunt that ended now without a sign or scent of\nprey.\n\nAnd he, Atanta, had led them. They were strong and loyal people, too,\nfor if he ordered them up and back along the trail that they had come,\neach man would go without a word and hope that there was some magic\nAtanta had yet to use.\n\nBut the animals were gone and the gods were gone, and there was but\none thing left. He would go down below this range where the Hotlanders\nwere known to be. Probably he would simply die in the sun. If not, the\nHotlanders would kill him on the spot, as they were usually so quick\nto do. The Hotlanders had good magic. Not as good as his ancestors',\nAtanta was sure. But still, they could kill a man from a great\ndistance, simply by pointing a magic charm and making a certain noise.\n\nPerhaps the Hotlanders wouldn't see him and perhaps he would not\ndie in the sun. Perhaps he would find some game by the edge of the\nHotlands. Perhaps....\n\nThe sun had tucked itself behind a white western peak when Atanta at\nlast came to the end of the ice field. Tired now, he crouched for a\nmoment like a bird with his bottom sitting squarely upon his heels.\nPresently his tiredness became true exhaustion, so he dug himself a\nlittle space in a shadowed snow bank and then covered himself with a\nmound of snow.\n\nWhile Atanta slept, a great lost bird came on the last feeble rays of\nlight, flapping its black wings because there was no wind to glide upon\nand there was no footing but the frozen ground. When above Atanta, the\nbird caught a slight scent in the air, held its wings stiff and tilted\nitself to glide in slow circles that became smaller and smaller and\never lower until at last the bird's tired feet sank deep into the snow\nbeside the mound where Atanta lay. The bird folded its wings about\nitself and pecked at the mound, its beak digging cautious holes in the\nsnow. Atanta stirred slightly at this intrusion, and the bird drew its\nbeak away and flapped its wings against the windless air and flew away.\n\nWhen Atanta woke, the night wind had curled itself with a scream about\nthe mountains and brought with it a fresh snow. He dug himself from his\nbed and smiled with his eyes closed at the night that sent the wind and\nsnow to caress his hair. When he opened his eyes, his face was tilted\nupward to the sky, and he smiled at the lonely stars.\n\nThe moon was full and heavy tonight, and it hung low in the western\nsky. Atanta wished his woman could be here beside him, nestling close\nto him in the soft snow, her delicate hands caressing the hair on his\ncheek. He thought of her hands rubbed raw from the straps of the heavy\npack. Perhaps it was better that he had left without saying goodbye.\n\nHe felt rested enough to go on, and was about to hoist himself to his\nfeet when the red star caught his attention. For months now it had been\ngrowing brighter with every night that passed, as if heralding some\nimportant event. This was the red star of rebirth, and he wished he\ncould believe that he and his people would someday go to live there;\nbut he no longer believed in anything.\n\nIt was then that Atanta saw the god. It was a great and fearful god\nthat turned the black night yellow and screamed louder than the wind.\nIn an instant it fell out of the sky; then the yellow light was gone\nand the voice of the god was gone, and the dark night returned and the\nvoice of the wind returned.\n\nAtanta fell to his knees and his trembling hand etched out the sign of\nthe cross in the snow. Surely this must be a sign. The god had come out\nof the sky and fallen in the path before him--forbidding him to go into\nthe lowlands. He knew he must pray and ask forgiveness but for many\nmoments he was too frightened to pray, and when the fear subsided, he\nwas too proud. Why should he pray to a god who would let his people\nstarve? He raised his eyes, and saw the very head of the god peering up\nabove the next rise.\n\nHe stood up with a semblance of dignity on his unsteady legs. When\nthe god did not move from behind the rise for many minutes, Atanta's\ncourage overbalanced his fear and he kicked the snow with his foot and\nobliterated the sign of the cross. He waited for the god to strike him\ndead, but nothing happened. The head of the god was motionless.\n\nAtanta set out with cautious steps. Presently he hid behind a little\nice dune where he could see the god in its awesome entirety. Now he\nwas close enough to hurl his spear at it if the god suddenly struck in\nanger; and he gripped the spear in readiness. Suddenly he was filled\nwith a new awe, for he realized that this was not the god of the cross!\nThere were no stiff wings at its side. It was like a huge shining spear\nwith its dull end stuck in the snow and its point stretching up to the\nsky. But how could this be a god?\n\nPerhaps he should not yet pray. Time had shown there were many false\ngods.\n\nPresently a black mouth appeared magically in the side of the great\nstill thing. The mouth sucked in the icy air for a moment and then\nextended a long jagged tongue down to the fresh snow.\n\nAtanta saw something move in the blackness of the gaping mouth and then\na figure stepped out onto the tongue and looked about at the falling\nsnow and the white jagged mountains in the darkness. It was the figure\nof a man. At least it was in a man's shape, but it did not look like\na man of the mountains nor did it look like the man-creatures of the\nHotlands. It walked slowly and laboriously down the tongue, and it\nseemed to be made of the same shiny stuff as the tongue and the flying\nwingless god itself. For a moment, Atanta wondered which was the god.\nThe great huge thing with the mouth and the tongue, or the man-thing?\n\nThe stranger stepped off the tongue into the snow where he knelt and\nscooped up the snow in his arms, tossed it into the wind which hurled\nit to the ground again. Then he stood and clutched his head. For a\nmoment Atanta thought he had taken his own head off, but then he could\ntell that he had taken a covering off his head which he tossed into the\nsnow. Then it seemed that the man had been entirely covered, like the\nmen of the Hotlands who wore furs.\n\nPresently the man had taken off all his covering, and stretched his\nfurry arms up to feel the sweetness of the wind. Atanta leaped up,\nshouting his surprise. For this was a true man.\n\nFor a moment the man was startled and then his face filled with joy.\nShowing his empty palms, he began to walk slowly toward Atanta.\n\nAtanta moved to meet him, the dark fur of his shoulders glistening\nin the moonlight. He spoke, but the man did not understand. Then\nhe pointed up to the sky, then to the man, and tilted his head\nquestioningly.\n\nThe man smiled and nodded his head. He pointed to the sky, but not\nstraight up. He pointed to a spot low in the west.\n\nHe pointed to the star of rebirth.\n\nWhile Atanta watched in unbelieving awe, the man touched his own chest,\nthen stooped to lay his palms on the snow at his feet. Then he pointed\nonce more to the red star and made a rapid upward gesture. Then he\nlaid his closed hands beside his head and pretended to be asleep. His\nfingers opened and closed, again and again. \"Many sleeps,\" said Atanta,\nunderstanding. \"Tens of ten sleeps.\"\n\nSmiling, the man straightened and made a rapid downward gesture, ending\nwith his palms again on the snow. Then he stepped forward, placing one\nhand on his chest, the other on Atanta's.\n\nThe two furry men stood as tall and straight as their dignity could\nmake them, and their faces were bright with joy. Then Atanta took the\nhammerstone out of the binding about his waist, and tossed it into the\nsnow.\n\nThe man nodded. Stepping back, he lifted his hand in an arc across the\nsky, and offered Atanta the stars.",
