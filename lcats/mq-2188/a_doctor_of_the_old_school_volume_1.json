Was\nthere ever any doctor so self-forgetful and so utterly Christian as\nWilliam MacLure? To which I am proud to reply, on my conscience: Not one\nman, but many in Scotland and in the South country. I will dare prophecy\nalso across the sea.\n\nIt has been one man's good fortune to know four country doctors, not one\nof whom was without his faults--Weelum was not perfect--but who, each\none, might have sat for my hero. Three are now resting from their\nlabors, and the fourth, if he ever should see these lines, would never\nidentify himself.\n\nThen I desire to thank my readers, and chiefly the medical profession\nfor the reception given to the Doctor of Drumtochty.\n\nFor many years I have desired to pay some tribute to a class whose\nservice to the community was known to every countryman, but after the\ntale had gone forth my heart failed. For it might have been despised\nfor the little grace of letters in the style and because of the outward\nroughness of the man. But neither his biographer nor his circumstances\nhave been able to obscure MacLure who has himself won all honest hearts,\nand received afresh the recognition of his more distinguished brethren.\nFrom all parts of the English-speaking world letters have come in\ncommendation of Weelum MacLure, and many were from doctors who had\nreceived new courage. It is surely more honor than a new writer could\never have deserved to receive the approbation of a profession whose\ncharity puts us all to shame.\n\nMay I take this first opportunity to declare how deeply my heart has\nbeen touched by the favor shown to a simple book by the American people,\nand to express my hope that one day it may be given me to see you face\nto face.\n\nIAN MACLAREN. Liverpool, Oct. 4, 1895.\n\n\n\n\n                        A GENERAL PRACTITIONER\n\n\n\nI\n\nA GENERAL PRACTITIONER\n\nDrumtochty was accustomed to break every law of health, except wholesome\nfood and fresh air, and yet had reduced the Psalmist's farthest limit to\nan average life-rate. Our men made no difference in their clothes for\nsummer or winter, Drumsheugh and one or two of the larger farmers\ncondescending to a topcoat on Sabbath, as a penalty of their position,\nand without regard to temperature. They wore their blacks at a funeral,\nrefusing to cover them with anything, out of respect to the deceased,\nand standing longest in the kirkyard when the north wind was blowing\nacross a hundred miles of snow. If the rain was pouring at the Junction,\nthen Drumtochty stood two minutes longer through sheer native dourness\ntill each man had a cascade from the tail of his coat, and hazarded the\nsuggestion, halfway to Kildrummie, that it had been \"a bit scrowie,\"\na \"scrowie\" being as far short of a \"shoor\" as a \"shoor\" fell below\n\"weet.\"\n\nThis sustained defiance of the elements provoked occasional judgments in\nthe shape of a \"hoast\" (cough), and the head of the house was then\nexhorted by his women folk to \"change his feet\" if he had happened to\nwalk through a burn on his way home, and was pestered generally with\nsanitary precautions. It is right to add that the  gudeman treated such\nadvice with contempt, regarding it as suitable for the effeminacy of\ntowns, but not seriously intended for Drumtochty. Sandy Stewart \"napped\"\nstones on the road in his shirt sleeves, wet or fair, summer and winter,\ntill he was persuaded to retire from active duty at eighty-five, and he\nspent ten years more in regretting his hastiness and criticising his\nsuccessor. The ordinary course of life, with fine air and contented\nminds, was to do a full share of work till seventy, and then to look\nafter \"orra\" jobs well into the eighties, and to \"slip awa\" within sight\nof ninety. Persons above ninety were understood to be acquitting\nthemselves with credit, and assumed airs of authority, brushing aside\nthe opinions of seventy as immature, and confirming their conclusions\nwith illustrations drawn from the end of last century.\n\nWhen Hillocks' brother so far forgot himself as to \"slip awa\"\nat sixty, that worthy man was scandalized, and offered laboured\nexplanations at the \"beerial.\"\n\n\"It's an awfu' business ony wy ye look at it, an' a sair trial tae us\na'. A' never heard tell o' sic a thing in oor family afore, an' it's no\neasy accoontin' for't.\n\n\"The gudewife was sayin' he wes never the same sin' a weet nicht he lost\nhimsel on the muir and slept below a bush; but that's neither here nor\nthere. A'm thinkin' he sappit his constitution thae twa years he wes\ngrieve aboot England. That wes thirty years syne, but ye're never the\nsame aifter thae foreign climates.\"\n\nDrumtochty listened patiently to Hillocks' apology, but was not\nsatisfied.\n\n\"It's clean havers about the muir. Losh keep's, we've a' sleepit oot and\nnever been a hair the waur.\n\n\"A' admit that England micht hae dune the job; it's no cannie stravagin'\nyon wy frae place tae place, but Drums never complained tae me if he hed\nbeen nippit in the Sooth.\"\n\nThe parish had, in fact, lost confidence in Drums after his wayward\nexperiment with a potato-digging machine, which turned out a lamentable\nfailure, and his premature departure confirmed our vague impression of\nhis character.\n\n\"He's awa noo,\" Drumsheugh summed up, after opinion had time to form;\n\"an' there were waur fouk than Drums, but there's nae doot he was a wee\nflichty.\"\n\nWhen illness had the audacity to attack a Drumtochty man, it was\ndescribed as a \"whup,\" and was treated by the men with a fine\nnegligence. Hillocks was sitting in the post-office one afternoon when\nI looked in for my letters, and the right side of his face was blazing\nred. His subject of discourse was the prospects of the turnip \"breer,\"\nbut he casually explained that he was waiting for medical advice.\n\n\"The gudewife is keepin' up a ding-dong frae mornin' till nicht aboot ma\nface, and a'm fair deaved (deafened), so a'm watchin' for MacLure tae\nget a bottle as he comes wast; yon's him noo.\"\n\nThe doctor made his diagnosis from horseback on sight, and stated the\nresult with that admirable clearness which endeared him to Drumtochty.\n\n\"Confoond ye, Hillocks, what are ye ploiterin' aboot here for in the\nweet wi' a face like a boiled beet? Div ye no ken that ye've a titch o'\nthe rose (erysipelas), and ocht tae be in the hoose? Gae hame wi' ye\nafore a' leave the bit, and send a haflin for some medicine. Ye donnerd\nidiot, are ye ettlin tae follow Drums afore yir time?\" And the medical\nattendant of Drumtochty continued his invective till Hillocks started,\nand still pursued his  retreating figure with medical directions of a\nsimple and practical character.\n\n\"A'm watchin', an' peety ye if ye pit aff time. Keep yir bed the\nmornin', and dinna show yir face in the fields till a' see ye. A'll gie\nye a cry on Monday--sic an auld fule--but there's no are o' them tae\nmind anither in the hale pairish.\"\n\nHillocks' wife informed the kirkyaird that the doctor \"gied the gudeman\nan awfu' clear-in',\" and that Hillocks \"wes keepin' the hoose,\" which\nmeant that the patient had tea breakfast, and at that time was wandering\nabout the farm buildings in an easy undress with his head in a plaid.\n\nIt was impossible for a doctor to earn even the most modest competence\nfrom a people of such scandalous health, and so MacLure had annexed\nneighbouring parishes. His house--little more than a cottage--stood on\nthe roadside among the pines towards the head of our Glen, and from this\nbase of operations he dominated the wild glen that broke the wall of the\nGrampians above Drumtochty--where the snow drifts were twelve feet deep\nin winter, and the only way of passage at times was the channel of the\nriver--and the moorland district westwards till he came to the Dunleith\nsphere of influence, where there were four doctors and a hydropathic.\nDrumtochty in its length, which was eight miles, and its breadth, which\nwas four, lay in his hand; besides a glen behind, unknown to the world,\nwhich in the night time he visited at the risk of life, for the way\nthereto was across the big moor with its peat holes and treacherous\nbogs. And he held the land eastwards towards Muirtown so far as Geordie,\nthe Drumtochty post, travelled every day, and could carry word that the\ndoctor was wanted. He did his best for the need of every man, woman and\nchild in this wild, straggling district, year in, year out, in the snow\nand in the heat, in the dark and in the light, without rest, and without\nholiday for forty years.\n\nOne horse could not do the work of this man, but we liked best to see\nhim on his old white mare, who died the week after her master, and the\npassing of the two did our hearts good. It was not that he rode\nbeautifully, for he broke every canon of art, flying with his arms,\nstooping till he seemed to be speaking into Jess's ears, and rising in\nthe saddle beyond all necessity. But he could rise faster, stay longer\nin the saddle, and had a firmer grip with his knees than any one I ever\nmet, and it was all for mercy's sake. When the reapers in harvest time\nsaw a figure whirling past in a cloud of dust, or the family at the foot\nof Glen Urtach, gathered round the fire on a winter's night, heard the\nrattle of a horse's hoofs on the road, or the shepherds, out after the\nsheep, traced a black speck moving across the snow to the upper glen,\nthey knew it was the doctor, and, without being conscious of it, wished\nhim God speed.\n\nBefore and behind his saddle were strapped the instruments and medicines\nthe doctor might want, for he never knew what was before him. There were\nno specialists in Drumtochty, so this man had to do everything as best\nhe could, and as quickly. He was chest doctor and doctor for every other\norgan as well; he was accoucheur and surgeon; he was oculist and aurist;\nhe was dentist and chloroformist, besides being chemist and druggist.\nIt was often told how he was far up Glen Urtach when the feeders of the\nthreshing mill caught young Burnbrae, and how he only stopped to change\nhorses at his house, and galloped all the way to Burnbrae, and flung\nhimself off his horse and amputated the arm, and saved the lad's life.\n\n\"You wud hae thocht that every meenut was an hour,\" said Jamie Soutar,\nwho had been at the threshing, \"an' a'll never forget the puir lad lying\nas white as deith on the floor o' the loft, wi' his head on a sheaf, an'\nBurnbrae haudin' the bandage ticht an' prayin' a' the while, and the\nmither greetin' in the corner.\n\n\"'Will he never come?' she cries, an' a' heard the soond o' the horse's\nfeet on the road a mile awa in the frosty air.\n\n\"'The Lord be praised!' said Burnbrae, and a' slippit doon the ladder\nas the doctor came skelpin' intae the close, the foam fleein' frae his\nhorse's mooth.\n\n\"Whar is he?' wes a' that passed his lips, an' in five meenuts he hed\nhim on the feedin' board, and wes at his wark--sic wark, neeburs--but he\ndid it weel. An' ae thing a' thocht rael thochtfu' o' him: he first sent\naff the laddie's mither tae get a bed ready.\n\n\"Noo that's feenished, and his constitution 'ill dae the rest,\" and he\ncarried the lad doon the ladder in his airms like a bairn, and laid him\nin his bed, and waits aside him till he wes sleepin', and then says he:\n'Burnbrae, yir gey lad never tae say 'Collie, will yelick?' for a' hevna\ntasted meat for saxteen hoors.'\n\n\"It was michty tae see him come intae the yaird that day, neeburs; the\nverra look o' him wes victory.\"\n\nJamie's cynicism slipped off in the enthusiasm of this reminiscence, and\nhe expressed the feeling of Drumtochty. No one sent for MacLure save in\ngreat straits, and the sight of him put courage in sinking hearts. But\nthis was not by the grace of his appearance, or the advantage of a good\nbedside manner. A tall, gaunt, loosely made man, without an ounce of\nsuperfluous flesh on his body, his face burned a dark brick color by\nconstant exposure to the weather, red hair and beard turning grey,\nhonest blue eyes that look you ever in the face, huge hands with wrist\nbones like the shank of a ham, and a voice that hurled his salutations\nacross two fields, he suggested the moor rather  than the drawing-room.\nBut what a clever hand it was in an operation, as delicate as a woman's,\nand what a kindly voice it was in the humble room where the shepherd's\nwife was weeping by her man's bedside. He was \"ill pitten the gither\" to\nbegin with, but many of his physical defects were the penalties of his\nwork, and endeared him to the Glen. That ugly scar that cut into his\nright eyebrow and gave him such a sinister expression, was got one night\nJess slipped on the ice and laid him insensible eight miles from home.\nHis limp marked the big snowstorm in the fifties, when his horse missed\nthe road in Glen Urtach, and they rolled together in a drift. MacLure\nescaped with a broken leg and the fracture of three ribs, but he never\nwalked like other men again. He could not swing himself into the saddle\nwithout making two attempts and holding Jess's mane. Neither can you\n\"warstle\" through the peat bogs and snow drifts for forty winters\nwithout a touch of rheumatism. But they were honorable scars, and for\nsuch risks of life men get the Victoria Cross in other fields.\n\nMacLure got nothing but the secret affection of the Glen, which knew\nthat none had ever done one-tenth as much for it as this ungainly,\ntwisted, battered figure, and I have  seen a Drumtochty face\nsoften at the sight of MacLure limping to his horse.\n\nMr. Hopps earned the ill-will of the Glen for ever by criticising\nthe doctor's dress, but indeed it would have filled any townsman with\namazement. Black he wore once a year, on Sacrament Sunday, and, if\npossible, at a funeral; topcoat or waterproof never. His jacket and\nwaistcoat were rough homespun of Glen Urtach wool, which threw off the\nwet like a duck's back, and below he was clad in shepherd's tartan\ntrousers, which disappeared into unpolished riding boots. His shirt was\ngrey flannel, and he was uncertain about a collar, but certain as to a\ntie which he never had, his beard doing instead, and his hat was soft\nfelt of four colors and seven different shapes. His point of distinction\nin dress was the trousers, and they were the subject of unending\nspeculation.\n\n\"Some threep that he's worn thae eedentical pair the last twenty year,\nan' a' mind masel him gettin' a tear ahint, when he was crossin' oor\npalin', and the mend's still veesible.\n\n\"Ithers declare 'at he's got a wab o' claith, and hes a new pair made in\nMuirtown aince in the twa year maybe, and keeps them in the garden till\nthe new look wears aff.\n\n\"For ma ain pairt,\" Soutar used to declare, \"a' canna mak up my mind,\nbut there's ae thing sure, the Glen wud not like tae see him withoot\nthem: it wud be a shock tae confidence. There's no muckle o' the check\nleft, but ye can aye tell it, and when ye see thae breeks comin' in ye\nken that if human pooer can save yir bairn's life it 'ill be dune.\"\n\nThe confidence of the Glen--and tributary states--was unbounded, and\nrested partly on long experience of the doctor's resources, and partly\non his hereditary connection.\n\n\"His father was here afore him,\" Mrs. Macfadyen used to explain; \"atween\nthem they've hed the countyside for weel on tae a century; if MacLure\ndisna understand oor constitution, wha dis, a' wud like tae ask?\"\n\nFor Drumtochty had its own constitution and a special throat disease, as\nbecame a parish which was quite self-contained between the woods and the\nhills, and not dependent on the lowlands either for its diseases or its\ndoctors.\n\n\"He's a skilly man, Doctor MacLure,\" continued my friend Mrs. Macfayden,\nwhose judgment on sermons or anything else was seldom at fault; \"an'\na kind-hearted, though o' coorse he hes his faults like us a', an' he\ndisna tribble the Kirk often.\n\n\"He aye can tell what's wrang wi' a body, an' maistly he can put ye\nricht, and there's nae new-fangled wys wi' him: a blister for the\nootside an' Epsom salts for the inside dis his wark, an' they say\nthere's no an herb on the hills he disna ken.\n\n\"If we're tae dee, we're tae dee; an' if we're tae live, we're tae live,\"\nconcluded Elspeth, with sound Calvinistic logic; \"but a'll say this\nfor the doctor, that whether yir tae live or dee, he can aye keep up a\nsharp meisture on the skin.\"\n\n\"But he's no veera ceevil gin ye bring him when there's naethin' wrang,\"\nand Mrs. Macfayden's face reflected another of Mr. Hopps' misadventures\nof which Hillocks held the copyright.\n\n\"Hopps' laddie ate grosarts (gooseberries) till they hed to sit up a'\nnicht wi' him, an' naethin' wud do but they maun hae the doctor, an' he\nwrites 'immediately' on a slip o' paper.\n\n\"Weel, MacLure had been awa a' nicht wi' a shepherd's wife Dunleith wy,\nand he comes here withoot drawin' bridle, mud up tae the cen.\n\n\"'What's a dae here, Hillocks?\" he cries; 'it's no an accident, is't?'\nand when he got aff his horse he cud hardly stand wi' stiffness and\ntire.\n\n\"'It's nane o' us, doctor; it's Hopps' laddie; he's been eatin' ower\nmony berries.'\n\n\"If he didna turn on me like a tiger.\n\n\"Div ye mean tae say----'\n\n\"'Weesht, weesht,' an' I tried tae quiet him, for Hopps wes comin' oot.\n\n\"'Well, doctor,' begins he, as brisk as a magpie, 'you're here at last;\nthere's no hurry with you Scotchmen. My boy has been sick all night, and\nI've never had one wink of sleep. You might have come a little quicker,\nthat's all I've got to say.'\n\n\"We've mair tae dae in Drumtochty than attend tae every bairn that hes a\nsair stomach,' and a' saw MacLure wes roosed.\n\n\"'I'm astonished to hear you speak. Our doctor at home always says to\nMrs. 'Opps \"Look on me as a family friend, Mrs. 'Opps, and send for me\nthough it be only a headache.\"'\n\n\"'He'd be mair sparin' o' his offers if he hed four and twenty mile tae\nlook aifter. There's naethin' wrang wi' yir laddie but greed. Gie him a\ngude dose o' castor oil and stop his meat for a day, an' he 'ill be a'\nricht the morn.'\n\n\"'He 'ill not take castor oil, doctor. We have given up those barbarous\nmedicines.'\n\n\"'Whatna kind o' medicines hae ye noo in the Sooth?'\n\n\"'Well, you see, Dr. MacLure, we're homoeopathists, and I've my little\nchest here,' and oot Hopps comes wi' his boxy.\n\n\"'Let's see't,' an' MacLure sits doon and taks oot the bit bottles, and\nhe reads the names wi' a lauch every time.\n\n\"'Belladonna; did ye ever hear the like? Aconite; it cowes a'. Nux\nVomica. What next? Weel, ma mannie,' he says tae Hopps, 'it's a fine\nploy, and ye 'ill better gang on wi' the Nux till it's dune, and gie him\nony ither o' the sweeties he fancies.\n\n\"'Noo, Hillocks, a' maun be aff tae see Drumsheugh's grieve, for he's\ndoon wi' the fever, and it's tae be a teuch fecht. A' hinna time tae\nwait for dinner; gie me some cheese an' cake in ma haund, and Jess 'ill\ntak a pail o' meal an' water.\n\n\"'Fee; a'm no wantin' yir fees, man; wi' that boxy ye dinna need a\ndoctor; na, na, gie yir siller tae some puir body, Maister Hopps,' an'\nhe was doon the road as hard as he cud lick.\"\n\nHis fees were pretty much what the folk chose to give him, and he\ncollected them once a year at Kildrummie fair.\n\n\"Well, doctor, what am a' awin' ye for the wife and bairn? Ye 'ill need\nthree notes for that nicht ye stayed in the hoose an' a' the veesits.\"\n\n\"Havers,\" MacLure would answer, \"prices are low, a'm hearing; gie's\nthirty shillings.\"\n\n\"No, a'll no, or the wife 'ill tak ma ears off,\" and it was settled for\ntwo pounds. Lord Kilspindie gave him a free house and fields, and one\nway or other, Drumsheugh told me, the doctor might get in about L150.\na year, out of which he had to pay his old housekeeper's wages and a\nboy's, and keep two horses, besides the cost of instruments and books,\nwhich he bought through a friend in Edinburgh with much judgment.\n\nThere was only one man who ever complained of the doctor's charges, and\nthat was the new farmer of Milton, who was so good that he was above\nboth churches, and held a meeting in his barn. (It was Milton the Glen\nsupposed at first to be a Mormon, but I can't go into that now.) He\noffered MacLure a pound less than he asked, and two tracts, whereupon\nMacLure expressed his opinion of Milton, both from a theological and\nsocial standpoint, with such vigor and frankness that an attentive\naudience of Drumtochty men could hardly contain themselves. Jamie Soutar\nwas selling his pig at the time, and missed the meeting, but he hastened\nto condole with Milton, who was complaining everywhere of the doctor's\nlanguage.\n\n\"Ye did richt tae resist him; it 'ill maybe roose the Glen tae mak a\nstand; he fair hands them in bondage.\n\n\"Thirty shillings for twal veesits, and him no mair than seeven mile\nawa, an' a'm telt there werena mair than four at nicht.\n\n\"Ye 'ill hae the sympathy o' the Glen, for a' body kens yir as free wi'\nyir siller as yir tracts.\n\n\"Wes't 'Beware o' gude warks' ye offered him? Man, ye choose it weel,\nfor he's been colleckin' sae mony thae forty years, a'm feared for him.\n\n\"A've often thocht oor doctor's little better than the Gude Samaritan,\nan' the Pharisees didna think muckle o' his chance aither in this warld\nor that which is tae come.\"",
