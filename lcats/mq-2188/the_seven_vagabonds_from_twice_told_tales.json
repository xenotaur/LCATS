    "body": "\nRambling on foot in the spring of my life and the summer of the year,\nI came one afternoon to a point which gave me the choice of three\ndirections.  Straight before me, the main road extended its dusty\nlength to Boston; on the left a branch went towards the sea, and would\nhave lengthened my journey a trifle of twenty or thirty miles; while\nby the right-hand path, I might have gone over hills and lakes to\nCanada, visiting in my way the celebrated town of Stamford.  On a\nlevel spot of grass, at the foot of the guidepost, appeared an object,\nwhich, though locomotive on a different principle, reminded me of\nGulliver's portable mansion among the Brobdignags.  It was a huge\ncovered wagon, or, more properly, a small house on wheels, with a door\non one side and a window shaded by green blinds on the other.  Two\nhorses, munching provender out of the baskets which muzzled them, were\nfastened near the vehicle: a delectable sound of music proceeded from\nthe interior; and I immediately conjectured that this was some\nitinerant show, halting at the confluence of the roads to intercept\nsuch idle travellers as myself.  A shower had long been climbing up\nthe western sky, and now hung so blackly over my onward path that it\nwas a point of wisdom to seek shelter here.\n\n\"Halloo!  Who stands guard here?  Is the doorkeeper asleep?\" cried I,\napproaching a ladder of two or three steps which was let down from the\nwagon.\n\nThe music ceased at my summons, and there appeared at the door, not\nthe sort of figure that I had mentally assigned to the wandering\nshowman, but a most respectable old personage, whom I was sorry to\nhave addressed in so free a style.  He wore a snuff colored coat and\nsmall-clothes, with white-top boots, and exhibited the mild dignity of\naspect and manner which may often be noticed in aged schoolmasters,\nand sometimes in deacons, selectmen, or other potentates of that kind.\nA small piece of silver was my passport within his premises, where I\nfound only one other person, hereafter to be described.\n\n\"This is a dull day for business,\" said the old gentleman, as he\nushered me in; \"but I merely tarry here to refresh the cattle, being\nbound for the camp-meeting at Stamford.\"\n\nPerhaps the movable scene of this narrative is still peregrinating New\nEngland, and may enable the reader to test the accuracy of my\ndescription.  The spectacle--for I will not use the unworthy term of\npuppet-show--consisted of a multitude of little people assembled on a\nminiature stage.  Among them were artisans of every kind, in the\nattitudes of their toil, and a group of fair ladies and gay gentlemen\nstanding ready for the dance; a company of foot-soldiers formed a line\nacross the stage, looking stern, grim, and terrible enough, to make it\na pleasant consideration that they were but three inches high; and\nconspicuous above the whole was seen a Merry-Andrew, in the pointed\ncap and motley coat of his profession.  All the inhabitants of this\nmimic world were motionless, like the figures in a picture, or like\nthat people who one moment were alive in the midst of their business\nand delights, and the next were transformed to statues, preserving an\neternal semblance of labor that was ended, and pleasure that could be\nfelt no more.  Anon, however, the old gentleman turned the handle of a\nbarrel-organ, the first note of which produced a most enlivening\neffect upon the figures, and awoke them all to their proper\noccupations and amusements.  By the self-same impulse the tailor plied\nhis needle, the blacksmith's hammer descended upon the anvil, and the\ndancers whirled away on feathery tiptoes; the company of soldiers\nbroke into platoons, retreated from the stage, and were succeeded by a\ntroop of horse, who came prancing onward with such a sound of trumpets\nand trampling of hoofs, as might have startled Don Quixote himself;\nwhile an old toper, of inveterate ill habits, uplifted his black\nbottle and took off a hearty swig.  Meantime the Merry-Andrew began to\ncaper and turn somersets, shaking his sides, nodding his head, and\nwinking his eyes in as life-like a manner as if he were ridiculing the\nnonsense of all human affairs, and making fun of the whole multitude\nbeneath him.  At length the old magician (for I compared the showman\nto Prospero, entertaining his guests with a mask of shadows) paused\nthat I might give utterance to my wonder.\n\n\"What an admirable piece of work is this!\" exclaimed I, lifting up my\nbands in astonishment.\n\nIndeed, I liked the spectacle, and was tickled with the old man's\ngravity as he presided at it, for I had none of that foolish wisdom\nwhich reproves every occupation that is not useful in this world of\nvanities.  If there be a faculty which I possess more perfectly than\nmost men, it is that of throwing myself mentally into situations\nforeign to my own, and detecting, with a cheerful eye, the desirable\ncircumstances of each.  I could have envied the life of this\ngray-headed showman, spent as it had been in a course of safe and\npleasurable adventure, in driving his huge vehicle sometimes through\nthe sands of Cape Cod, and sometimes over the rough forest roads of\nthe north and east, and halting now on the green before a village\nmeeting-house, and now in a paved square of the metropolis.  How often\nmust his heart have been gladdened by the delight of children, as they\nviewed these animated figures!  or his pride indulged, by haranguing\nlearnedly to grown men on the mechanical powers which produced such\nwonderful effects! or his gallantry brought into play (for this is an\nattribute which such grave men do not lack) by the visits of pretty\nmaidens!  And then with how fresh a feeling must he return, at\nintervals, to his own peculiar home!\n\n\"I would I were assured of as happy a life as his,\" thought I. Though\nthe showman's wagon might have accommodated fifteen or twenty\nspectators, it now contained only himself and me, and a third person\nat whom I threw a glance on entering.  He was a neat and trim young\nman of two or three and twenty; his drab hat, and green frock-coat\nwith velvet collar, were smart, though no longer new; while a pair of\ngreen spectacles, that seemed needless to his brisk little eyes, gave\nhim something of a scholar-like and literary air.  After allowing me a\nsufficient time to inspect the puppets, he advanced with a bow, and\ndrew my attention to some books in a corner of the wagon.  These he\nforthwith began to extol, with an amazing volubility of well-sounding\nwords, and an ingenuity of praise that won him my heart, as being\nmyself one of the most merciful of critics.  Indeed, his stock\nrequired some considerable powers of commendation in the salesman;\nthere were several ancient friends of mine, the novels of those happy\ndays when my affections wavered between the Scottish Chiefs and Thomas\nThumb; besides a few of later date, whose merits had not been\nacknowledged by the public.  I was glad to find that dear little\nvenerable volume, the New England Primer, looking as antique as ever,\nthough in its thousandth new edition; a bundle of superannuated gilt\npicture-books made such a child of me, that, partly for the glittering\ncovers, and partly for the fairy-tales within, I bought the whole; and\nan assortment of ballads and popular theatrical songs drew largely on\nmy purse.  To balance these expenditures, I meddled neither with\nsermons, nor science, nor morality, though volumes of each were there;\nnor with a Life of Franklin in the coarsest of paper, but so showily\nbound that it was emblematical of the Doctor himself, in the court\ndress which he refused to wear at Paris; nor with Webster's Spelling\nBook, nor some of Byron's minor poems, nor half a dozen little\nTestaments at twenty-five cents each.\n\nThus far the collection might have been swept from some great\nbookstore, or picked up at an evening auction-room; but there was one\nsmall blue-covered pamphlet, which the peddler handed me with so\npeculiar an air, that I purchased it immediately at his own price; and\nthen, for the first time, the thought struck me, that I had spoken\nface to face with the veritable author of a printed book.  The\nliterary man now evinced a great kindness for me, and I ventured to\ninquire which way he was travelling.\n\n\"O,\" said he, \"I keep company with this old gentleman here, and we are\nmoving now towards the camp-meeting at Stamford!\"\n\nHe then explained to me, that for the present season he had rented a\ncorner of the wagon as a bookstore, which, as he wittily observed, was\na true Circulating Library, since there were few parts of the country\nwhere it had not gone its rounds.  I approved of the plan exceedingly,\nand began to sum up within my mind the many uncommon felicities in the\nlife of a book-peddler, especially when his character resembled that of\nthe individual before me.  At a high rate was to be reckoned the daily\nand hourly enjoyment of such interviews as the present, in which he\nseized upon the admiration of a passing stranger, and made him aware\nthat a man of literary taste, and even of literary achievement, was\ntravelling the country in a showman's wagon.  A more valuable, yet not\ninfrequent triumph, might be won in his conversation with some elderly\nclergyman, long vegetating in a rocky, woody, watery back settlement of\nNew England, who, as he recruited his library from the peddler's stock\nof sermons, would exhort him to seek a college education and become\nthe first scholar in his class.  Sweeter and prouder yet would be his\nsensations, when, talking poetry while he sold spelling-books, he\nshould charm the mind, and haply touch the heart of a fair country\nschoolmistress, herself an unhonored poetess, a wearer of blue\nstockings which none but himself took pains to look at.  But the scene\nof his completest glory would be when the wagon had halted for the\nnight, and his stock of books was transferred to some crowded bar-room.\nThen would he recommend to the multifarious company, whether\ntraveller from the city, or teamster from the hills, or neighboring\nsquire, or the landlord himself, or his loutish hostler, works suited\nto each particular taste and capacity; proving, all the while, by\nacute criticism and profound remark, that the lore in his books was\neven exceeded by that in his brain.\n\nThus happily would he traverse the land; sometimes a herald before the\nmarch of Mind; sometimes walking arm in arm with awful Literature; and\nreaping everywhere a harvest of real and sensible popularity, which\nthe secluded bookworms, by whose toil he lived, could never hope for.\n\n\"If ever I meddle with literature,\" thought I, fixing myself in\nadamantine resolution, \"it shall be as a travelling bookseller.\"\n\nThough it was still mid-afternoon, the air had now grown dark about\nus, and a few drops of rain came down upon the roof of our vehicle,\npattering like the feet of birds that had flown thither to rest.  A\nsound of pleasant voices made us listen, and there soon appeared half-way\nup the ladder the pretty person of a young damsel, whose rosy face\nwas so cheerful, that even amid the gloomy light it seemed as if the\nsunbeams were peeping under her bonnet.  We next saw the dark and\nhandsome features of a young man, who, with easier gallantry than\nmight have been expected in the heart of Yankee-land, was assisting\nher into the wagon.  It became immediately evident to us, when the two\nstrangers stood within the door, that they were of a profession\nkindred to those of my companions; and I was delighted with the more\nthan hospitable, the even paternal kindness, of the old showman's\nmanner, as he welcomed them; while the man of literature hastened to\nlead the merry-eyed girl to a seat on the long bench.\n\n\"You are housed but just in time, my young friends,\" said the master\nof the wagon.  \"The sky would have been down upon you within five\nminutes.\"\n\nThe young man's reply marked him as a foreigner, not by any variation\nfrom the idiom and accent of good English, but because he spoke with\nmore caution and accuracy, than if perfectly familiar with the\nlanguage.\n\n\"We knew that a shower was hanging over us,\" said he, \"and consulted\nwhether it were best to enter the house on the top of yonder hill, but\nseeing your wagon in the road--\"\n\n\"We agreed to come hither,\" interrupted the girl, with a smile,\n\"because we should be more at home in a wandering house like this.\"\n\nI, meanwhile, with many a wild and undetermined fantasy, was narrowly\ninspecting these two doves that had flown into our ark. The young man,\ntall, agile, and athletic, wore a mass of black shining curls\nclustering round a dark and vivacious countenance, which, if it had\nnot greater expression, was at least more active, and attracted\nreadier notice, than the quiet faces of our countrymen.  At his first\nappearance, he had been laden with a neat mahogany box, of about two\nfeet square, but very light in proportion to its size, which he had\nimmediately unstrapped from his shoulders and deposited on the floor\nof the wagon.\n\nThe girl had nearly as fair a complexion as our own beauties, and a\nbrighter one than most of them; the lightness of her figure, which\nseemed calculated to traverse the whole world without weariness,\nsuited well with the glowing cheerfulness of her face; and her gay\nattire, combining the rainbow hues of crimson, green, and a deep\norange, was as proper to her lightsome aspect as if she had been born\nin it.  This gay stranger was appropriately burdened with that\nmirth-inspiring instrument, the fiddle, which her companion took from\nher hands, and shortly began the process of tuning.  Neither of us--the\nprevious company of the wagon-needed to inquire their trade; for this\ncould be no mystery to frequenters of brigade-musters, ordinations,\ncattle-shows, commencements, and other festal meetings in our sober\nland; and there is a dear friend of mine, who will smile when this\npage recalls to his memory a chivalrous deed performed by us, in\nrescuing the show-box of such a couple from a mob of great\ndouble-fisted countrymen.\n\n\"Come,\" said I to the damsel of gay attire, \"shall we visit all the\nwonders of the world together?\"\n\nShe understood the metaphor at once; though indeed it would not much\nhave troubled me, if she had assented to the literal meaning of my\nwords.  The mahogany box was placed in a proper position, and I peeped\nin through its small round magnifying window, while the girl sat by my\nside, and gave short descriptive sketches, as one after another the\npictures were unfolded to my view.  We visited together, at least our\nimaginations did, full many a famous city, in the streets of which I\nhad long yearned to tread; once, I remember, we were in the harbor of\nBarcelona, gazing townwards; next, she bore me through the air to\nSicily, and bade me look up at blazing AEtna; then we took wing to\nVenice, and sat in a gondola beneath the arch of the Rialto; and anon\nshe sat me down among the thronged spectators at the coronation of\nNapoleon. But there was one scene, its locality she could not tell,\nwhich charmed my attention longer than all those gorgeous palaces and\nchurches, because the fancy hammed me, that I myself, the preceding\nsummer, had beheld just such a humble meeting-house, in just such a\npine-surrounded nook, among our own green mountains. All these\npictures were tolerably executed, though far inferior to the girl's\ntouches of description; nor was it easy to comprehend, how in so few\nsentences, and these, as I supposed, in a language foreign to her, she\ncontrived to present an airy copy of each varied scene.  When we had\ntravelled through the vast extent of the mahogany box, I looked into\nmy guide's face.\n\n\"Where are you going, my pretty maid?\"  inquired I, in the words of an\nold song.\n\n\"Ah,\" said the gay damsel, \"you might as well ask where the summer\nwind is going.  We are wanderers here, and there, and everywhere.\nWherever there is mirth, our merry hearts are drawn to it.  To-day,\nindeed, the people have told us of a great frolic and festival in\nthese parts; so perhaps we may be needed at what you call the\ncamp-meeting at Stamford.\"\n\nThen in my happy youth, and while her pleasant voice yet sounded in my\nears, I sighed; for none but myself, I thought, should have been her\ncompanion in a life which seemed to realize my own wild fancies,\ncherished all through visionary boyhood to that hour. To these two\nstrangers the world was in its golden age, not that indeed it was less\ndark and sad than ever, but because its weariness and sorrow had no\ncommunity with their ethereal nature. Wherever they might appear in\ntheir pilgrimage of bliss, Youth would echo back their gladness,\ncare-stricken Maturity would rest a moment from its toil, and Age,\ntottering among the graves, would smile in withered joy for their\nsakes.  The lonely cot, the narrow and gloomy street, the sombre\nshade, would catch a passing gleam like that now shining on ourselves,\nas these bright spirits wandered by.  Blessed pair, whose happy home\nwas throughout all the earth!  I looked at my shoulders, and thought\nthem broad enough to sustain those pictured towns and mountains; mine,\ntoo, was an elastic foot, as tireless as the wing of the bird of\nparadise; mine was then an untroubled heart, that would have gone\nsinging on its delightful way.\n\n\"O maiden!\" said I aloud, \"why did you not come hither alone?\"\n\nWhile the merry girl and myself were busy with the show-box, the\nunceasing rain had driven another wayfarer into the wagon.  He seemed\npretty nearly of the old showman's age, but much smaller, leaner, and\nmore withered than he, and less respectably clad in a patched suit of\ngray; withal, he had a thin, shrewd countenance, and a pair of\ndiminutive gray eyes, which peeped rather too keenly out of their\npuckered sockets.  This old fellow had been joking with the showman,\nin a manner which intimated previous acquaintance; but perceiving that\nthe damsel and I had terminated our affairs, he drew forth a folded\ndocument, and presented it to me.  As I had anticipated, it proved to\nbe a circular, written in a very fair and legible hand, and signed by\nseveral distinguished gentlemen whom I had never heard of, stating\nthat the bearer had encountered every variety of misfortune, and\nrecommending him to the notice of all charitable people.  Previous\ndisbursements had left me no more than a five-dollar bill, out of\nwhich, however, I offered to make the beggar a donation, provided he\nwould give me change for it.  The object of my beneficence looked\nkeenly in my face, and discerned that, I had none of that abominable\nspirit, characteristic though it be, of a full-blooded Yankee, which\ntakes pleasure in detecting every little harmless piece of knavery.\n\n\"Why, perhaps,\" said the ragged old mendicant, \"if the bank is in good\nstanding, I can't say but I may have enough about me to change your\nbill.\"\n\n\"It is a bill of the Suffolk Bank,\" said I, \"and better than the\nspecie.\"\n\nAs the beggar had nothing to object, he now produced a small\nbuff-leather bag, tied up carefully with a shoe-string.  When this was\nopened, there appeared a very comfortable treasure of silver coins of\nall sorts and sizes; and I even fancied that I saw, gleaming among\nthem, the golden plumage of that rare bird in our currency, the\nAmerican Eagle.  In this precious heap was my bank, note deposited,\nthe rate of exchange being considerably against me.  His wants being\nthus relieved, the destitute man pulled out of his pocket an old pack\nof greasy cards, which had probably contributed to fill the buff\nleather bag, in more ways than one.\n\n\"Come,\" said he, \"I spy a rare fortune in your face, and for\ntwenty-five cents more, I'll tell you what it is.\"\n\nI never refuse to take a glimpse into futurity; so, after shuffling\nthe cards, and when the fair damsel had cut them, I dealt a portion to\nthe prophetic beggar.  Like others of his profession, before\npredicting the shadowy events that were moving on to meet me, he gave\nproof of his preternatural science, by describing scenes through which\nI had already passed.  Here let me have credit for a sober fact.  When\nthe old man had read a page in his book of fate, he bent his keen gray\neyes on mine, and proceeded to relate, in all its minute particulars,\nwhat was then the most singular event of my life.  It was one which I\nhad no purpose to disclose, till the general unfolding of all secrets;\nnor would it be a much stranger instance of inscrutable knowledge, or\nfortunate conjecture, if the beggar were to meet me in the street\nto-day, and repeat, word for word, the page which I have here written.\nThe fortune-teller, after predicting a destiny which time seems loath\nto make good, put up his cards, secreted his treasure-bag, and began\nto converse with the other occupants of the wagon.\n\n\"Well, old friend,\" said the showman, \"you have not yet told us which\nway your face is turned this afternoon.\"\n\n\"I am taking a trip northward, this warm weather,\" replied the\nconjurer, \"across the Connecticut first, and then up through Vermont,\nand may be into Canada before the fall.  But I must stop and see the\nbreaking up of the camp-meeting at Stamford.\"\n\nI began to think that all the vagrants in New England were converging\nto the camp-meeting, and had made this wagon their rendezvous by the\nway.  The showman now proposed that, when the shower was over, they\nshould pursue the road to Stamford together, it being sometimes the\npolicy of these people to form a sort of league and confederacy.\n\n\"And the young lady too,\" observed the gallant bibliopolist, bowing to\nher profoundly, \"and this foreign gentleman, as I understand, are on a\njaunt of pleasure to the same spot.  It would add incalculably to my\nown enjoyment, and I presume to that of my colleague and his friend,\nif they could be prevailed upon to join our party.\"\n\nThis arrangement met with approbation on all hands, nor were any of\nthose concerned more sensible of its advantages than myself, who had\nno title to be included in it.  Having already satisfied myself as to\nthe several modes in which the four others attained felicity, I next\nset my mind at work to discover what enjoyments were peculiar to the\nold   \"Straggler,\" as the people of the country would have termed the\nwandering mendicant and prophet. As he pretended to familiarity with\nthe Devil, so I fancied that he was fitted to pursue and take delight\nin his way of life, by possessing some of the mental and moral\ncharacteristics, the lighter and more comic ones, of the Devil in\npopular stories. Among them might be reckoned a love of deception for\nits own sake, a shrewd eye and keen relish for human weakness and\nridiculous infirmity, and the talent of petty fraud.  Thus to this old\nman there would be pleasure even in the consciousness, so\ninsupportable to some minds, that his whole life was a cheat upon the\nworld, and that, so far as he was concerned with the public, his\nlittle cunning had the upper hand of its united wisdom.  Every day\nwould furnish him with a succession of minute and pungent triumphs: as\nwhen, for instance, his importunity wrung a pittance out of the heart\nof a miser, or when my silly good-nature transferred a part of my\nslender purse to his plump leather bag; or when some ostentatious\ngentleman should throw a coin to the ragged beggar who was richer than\nhimself; or when, though he would not always be so decidedly\ndiabolical, his pretended wants should make him a sharer in the scanty\nliving of real indigence.  And then what an inexhaustible field of\nenjoyment, both as enabling him to discern so much folly and achieve\nsuch quantities of minor mischief, was opened to his sneering spirit\nby his pretensions to prophetic knowledge.\n\nAll this was a sort of happiness which I could conceive of, though I\nhad little sympathy with it.  Perhaps, had I been then inclined to\nadmit it, I might have found that the roving life was more proper to\nhim than to either of his companions; for Satan, to whom I had\ncompared the poor man, has delighted, ever since the time of Job, in\n\"wandering up and down upon the earth\"; and indeed a crafty\ndisposition, which operates not in deep-laid plans, but in\ndisconnected tricks, could not have an adequate scope, unless\nnaturally impelled to a continual change of scene and society.  My\nreflections were here interrupted.\n\n\"Another visitor!\" exclaimed the old showman.\n\nThe door of the wagon had been closed against the tempest, which was\nroaring and blustering with prodigious fury and commotion, and beating\nviolently against our shelter, as if it claimed all those homeless\npeople for its lawful prey, while we, caring little for the\ndispleasure of the elements, sat comfortably talking.  There was now\nan attempt to open the door, succeeded by a voice, uttering some\nstrange, unintelligible gibberish, which my companions mistook for\nGreek, and I suspected to be thieves' Latin.  However, the showman\nstepped forward, and gave admittance to a figure which made me\nimagine; either that our wagon had rolled back two hundred years into\npast ages, or that the forest and its old inhabitants had sprung up\naround us by enchantment.\n\nIt was a red Indian, armed with his bow and arrow.  His dress was a\nsort of cap, adorned with a single feather of some wild bird, and a\nfrock of blue cotton, girded tight about him; on his breast, like\norders of knighthood, hung a crescent and a circle, and other\nornaments of silver; while a small crucifix betokened that our Father\nthe Pope had interposed between the Indian and the Great Spirit, whom\nhe had worshipped in his simplicity.  This son of the wilderness, and\npilgrim of the storm, took his place silently in the midst of us.\nWhen the first surprise was over, I rightly conjectured him to be one\nof the Penobscot tribe, parties of which I had often seen, in their\nsummer excursions down our Eastern rivers.  There they paddle their\nbirch canoes among the coasting schooners, and build their wigwam\nbeside some roaring milldam, and drive a little trade in basket-work\nwhere their fathers hunted deer.  Our new visitor was probably\nwandering through the country towards Boston, subsisting on the\ncareless charity of the people, while he turned his archery to\nprofitable account by shooting at cents, which were to be the prize of\nhis successful aim.\n\nThe Indian had not long been seated, ere our merry damsel sought to\ndraw him into conversation.  She, indeed, seemed all made up of\nsunshine in the mouth of May; for there was nothing so dark and dismal\nthat her pleasant mind could not cast a glow over it; and the wild\nIndian, like a fir-tree in his native forest, soon began to brighten\ninto a sort of sombre cheerfulness.  At length, she inquired whether\nhis journey had any particular end or purpose.\n\n\"I go shoot at the camp-meeting at Stamford,\" replied the Indian.\n\n\"And here are five more,\" said the girl, \"all aiming at the camp-meeting\ntoo.  You shall be one of us, for we travel with light hearts;\nand as for me, I sing merry songs, and tell merry tales, and am full\nof merry thoughts, and I dance merrily along the road, so that there\nis never any sadness among them that keep me company.  But, O, you\nwould find it very dull indeed, to go all the way to Stamford alone!\"\n\nMy ideas of the aboriginal character led me to fear that the Indian\nwould prefer his own solitary musings to the gay society thus offered\nhim; on the contrary, the girl's proposal met with immediate\nacceptance, and seemed to animate him with a misty expectation of\nenjoyment.  I now gave myself up to a course of thought which, whether\nit flowed naturally from this combination of events, or was drawn\nforth by a wayward fancy, caused my mind to thrill as if I were\nlistening to deep music.  I saw mankind, in this weary old age of the\nworld, either enduring a sluggish existence amid the smoke and dust of\ncities, or, if they breathed a purer air, still lying down at night\nwith no hope but to wear out to-morrow, and all the to-morrows which\nmake up life, among the same dull scenes and in the same wretched toil\nthat had darkened the sunshine of to-day.  But there were some, full\nof the primeval instinct, who preserved the freshness of youth to\ntheir latest years by the continual excitement of new objects, new\npursuits, and new associates; and cared little, though their\nbirthplace might have been here in New England, if the grave should\nclose over them in Central Asia.  Fate was summoning a parliament of\nthese free spirits; unconscious of the impulse which directed them to\na common centre, they had come hither from far and near; and last of\nall appeared the representative of those mighty vagrants, who had\nchased the deer during thousands of years, and were chasing it now in\nthe Spirit Land.  Wandering down through the waste of ages, the woods\nhad vanished around his path; his arm had lost somewhat of its\nstrength, his foot of its fleetness, his mien of its wild regality,\nhis heart and mind of their savage virtue and uncultured force; but\nhere, untamable to the routine of artificial life, roving now along\nthe dusty road, as of old over the forest leaves, here was the Indian\nstill.\n\n\"Well,\" said the old showman, in the midst of my meditations, \"here is\nan honest company of us,--one, two, three, four, five, six,--all going\nto the camp-meeting at Stamford.  Now, hoping no offence, I should\nlike to know where this young gentleman may be going?\"\n\nI started.  How came I among these wanderers?  The free mind, that\npreferred its own folly to another's wisdom; the open spirit, that\nfound companions everywhere; above all, the restless impulse, that had\nso often made me wretched in the midst of enjoyments: these were my\nclaims to be of their society.\n\n\"My friends!\" cried I, stepping into the centre of the wagon, \"I am\ngoing with you to the camp-meeting at Stamford.\"\n\n\"But in what capacity?\" asked the old showman, after a moment's\nsilence.  \"All of us here can get our bread in some creditable way.\nEvery honest man should have his livelihood.  You, sir, as I take it,\nare a mere strolling gentleman.\"\n\nI proceeded to inform the company, that, when Nature gave me a\npropensity to their way of life, she had not left me altogether\ndestitute of qualifications for it; though I could not deny that my\ntalent was less respectable, and might be less profitable, than the\nmeanest of theirs.  My design, in short, was to imitate the\nstorytellers of whom Oriental travellers have told us, and become an\nitinerant novelist, reciting my own extemporaneous fictions to such\naudiences as I could collect.\n\n\"Either this,\" said I, \"is my vocation, or I have been born in vain.\"\n\nThe fortune-teller, with a sly wink to the company, proposed to take\nme as an apprentice to one or other of his professions, either of\nwhich, undoubtedly, would have given full scope to whatever inventive\ntalent I might possess.  The bibliopolist spoke a few words in\nopposition to my plan, influenced partly, I suspect, by the jealousy\nof authorship, and partly by an apprehension that the _viva voce_\npractice would become general among novelists, to the infinite\ndetriment of the book-trade. Dreading a rejection, I solicited the\ninterest of the merry damsel.\n\n\"Mirth,\" cried I, most aptly appropriating the words of L'Allegro, \"to\nthee I sue!  Mirth, admit me of thy crew!\"\n\n\"Let us indulge the poor youth,\" said Mirth, with a kindness which\nmade me love her dearly, though I was no such coxcomb as to\nmisinterpret her motives.  \"I have espied much promise in him. True, a\nshadow sometimes flits across his brow, but the sunshine is sure to\nfollow in a moment.  He is never guilty of a sad thought, but a merry\none is twin born with it.  We will take him with us; and you shall see\nthat he will set us all a-laughing before we reach the camp-meeting at\nStamford.\"\n\nHer voice silenced the scruples of the rest, and gained me admittance\ninto the league; according to the terms of which, without a community\nof goods or profits, we were to lend each other all the aid, and avert\nall the harm, that might be in our power.  This affair settled, a\nmarvellous jollity entered into the whole tribe of us, manifesting\nitself characteristically in each individual.  The old showman,\nsitting down to his barrel-organ, stirred up the souls of the pygmy\npeople with one of the quickest tunes in the music-book; tailors,\nblacksmiths, gentlemen, and ladies, all seemed to share in the spirit\nof the occasion; and the Merry-Andrew played his part more facetiously\nthan ever, nodding and winking particularly at me.  The young\nforeigner flourished his fiddle-bow with a master's hand, and gave an\ninspiring echo to the showman's melody.  The bookish man and the merry\ndamsel started up simultaneously to dance; the former enacting the\ndouble shuffle in a style which everybody must have witnessed, ere\nElection week was blotted out of time; while the girl, setting her\narms akimbo with both hands at her slim waist, displayed such light\nrapidity of foot, and harmony of varying attitude and motion, that I\ncould not conceive how she ever was to stop; imagining, at the moment,\nthat Nature had made her, as the old showman had made his puppets, for\nno earthly purpose but to dance jigs.  The Indian bellowed forth a\nsuccession of most hideous outcries, somewhat afrighting us, till we\ninterpreted them as the war-song, with which, in imitation of his\nancestors, he was prefacing the assault on Stamford.  The conjurer,\nmeanwhile, sat demurely in a corner, extracting a sly enjoyment from\nthe whole scene, and, like the facetious Merry Andrew, directing his\nqueer glance particularly at me.\n\nAs for myself, with great exhilaration of fancy, I began to arrange\nand color the incidents of a tale, wherewith I proposed to amuse an\naudience that very evening; for I saw that my associates were a little\nashamed of me, and that no time was to be lost in obtaining a public\nacknowledgment of my abilities.\n\n\"Come, fellow-laborers,\" at last said the old showman, whom we had\nelected President; \"the shower is over, and we must be doing our duty\nby these poor souls at Stamford.\"\n\n\"We'll come among them in procession, with music and dancing,\" cried\nthe merry damsel.\n\nAccordingly--for it must be understood that our pilgrimage was to be\nperformed on foot--we sallied joyously out of the wagon, each of us,\neven the old gentleman in his white-top boots, giving a great skip as\nwe came down the ladder.  Above our heads there was such a glory of\nsunshine and splendor of clouds, and such brightness of verdure below,\nthat, as I modestly remarked at the time, Nature seemed to have washed\nher face, and put on the best of her jewelry and a fresh green gown,\nin honor of our confederation.  Casting our eyes northward, we beheld\na horseman approaching leisurely, and splashing through the little\npuddles on the Stamford road.  Onward he came, sticking up in his\nsaddle with rigid perpendicularity, a tall, thin figure in rusty\nblack, whom the showman and the conjurer shortly recognized to be,\nwhat his aspect sufficiently indicated, a travelling preacher of great\nfame among the Methodists.  What puzzled us was the fact, that his\nface appeared turned from, instead of to, the camp-meeting at\nStamford.  However, as this new votary of the wandering life drew near\nthe little green space, where the guidepost and our wagon were\nsituated, my six fellow-vagabonds and myself rushed forward and\nsurrounded him, crying out with united voices,--\n\n\"What news, what news from the camp-meeting at Stamford?\"\n\nThe missionary looked down, in surprise, at as singular a knot of\npeople as could have been selected from all his heterogeneous\nauditors.  Indeed, considering that we might all be classified under\nthe general head of Vagabond, there was great diversity of character\namong the grave old showman, the sly, prophetic beggar, the fiddling\nforeigner and his merry damsel, the smart bibliopolist, the sombre\nIndian, and myself, the itinerant novelist, a slender youth of\neighteen.  I even fancied that a smile was endeavoring to disturb the\niron gravity of the preacher's mouth.\n\n\"Good people,\" answered he, \"the camp-meeting is broke up.\"\n\nSo saying, the Methodist minister switched his steed, and rode\nwestward.  Our union being thus nullified, by the removal of its\nobject, we were sundered at once to the four winds of heaven. The\nfortune-teller, giving a nod to all, and a peculiar wink to me,\ndeparted on his northern tour, chuckling within himself as he took the\nStamford road.  The old showman and his literary coadjutor were\nalready tackling their horses to the wagon, with a design to\nperegrinate southwest along the seacoast.  The foreigner and the merry\ndamsel took their laughing leave, and pursued the eastern road, which\nI had that day trodden; as they passed away, the young man played a\nlively strain, and the girl's happy spirit broke into a dance; and\nthus, dissolving, as it were, into sunbeams and gay music, that\npleasant pair departed from my view.  Finally, with a pensive shadow\nthrown across my mind, yet emulous of the light philosophy of my late\ncompanions, I joined myself to the Penobscot Indian, and set forth\ntowards the distant city.",
