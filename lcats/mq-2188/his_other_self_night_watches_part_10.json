    "body": "\nHIS OTHER SELF\n\n\"They're as like as two peas, him and 'is brother,\" said the night-\nwatchman, gazing blandly at the indignant face of the lighterman on the\nbarge below; \"and the on'y way I know this one is Sam is because Bill\ndon't use bad langwidge.  Twins they are, but the likeness is only\noutside; Bill's 'art is as white as snow.\"\n\nHe cut off a plug of tobacco, and, placing it in his cheek, waited\nexpectantly.\n\n\"White as snow,\" he repeated.\n\n\"That's me,\" said the lighterman, as he pushed his unwieldy craft from\nthe jetty.  \"I'll tell Sam your opinion of 'im.  So long.\"\n\nThe watchman went a shade redder than usual.  That's twins all over, he\nsaid, sourly, always deceiving people.  It's Bill arter all, and,\ninstead of hurting 'is feelings, I've just been flattering of 'im up.\n\nIt ain't the fust time I've 'ad trouble over a likeness.  I've been a\ntwin myself in a manner o' speaking.  It didn't last long, but it lasted\nlong enough for me to always be sorry for twins, and to make a lot of\nallowance for them.  It must be very 'ard to have another man going\nabout with your face on 'is shoulders, and getting it into trouble.\n\nIt was a year or two ago now.  I was sitting one evening at the gate,\nsmoking a pipe and looking at a newspaper I 'ad found in the office,\nwhen I see a gentleman coming along from the swing-bridge.  Well-\ndressed, clean-shaved chap 'e was, smoking a cigarette.  He was walking\nslow and looking about 'im casual-like, until his eyes fell on me, when\nhe gave a perfect jump of surprise, and, arter looking at me very 'ard,\nwalked on a little way and then turned back.  He did it twice, and I was\njust going to say something to 'im, something that I 'ad been getting\nready for 'im, when he spoke to me.\n\n\"Good evening,\" he ses.\n\n\"Good evening,\" I ses, folding the paper over and looking at 'im rather\nsevere.\n\n\"I hope you'll excuse me staring,\" he ses, very perlite; \"but I've never\nseen such a face and figger as yours in all my life--never.\"\n\n\"Ah, you ought to ha' seen me a few years ago,\" I ses.  \"I'm like\neverybody else--I'm getting on.\"\n\n\"Rubbish!\"  he ses.  \"You couldn't be better if you tried.  It's\nmarvellous!  Wonderful!  It's the very thing I've been looking for.\nWhy, if you'd been made to order you couldn't ha' been better.\"\n\nI thought at fust he was by way of trying to get a drink out o' me--I've\nbeen played that game afore--but instead o' that he asked me whether I'd\ndo 'im the pleasure of 'aving one with 'im.\n\nWe went over to the Albion, and I believe I could have 'ad it in a pail\nif I'd on'y liked to say the word.  And all the time I was drinking he\nwas looking me up and down, till I didn't know where to look, as the\nsaying is.\n\n\"I came down 'ere to look for somebody like you,\" he ses, \"but I never\ndreamt I should have such luck as this.  I'm an actor, and I've got to\nplay the part of a sailor, and I've been worried some time 'ow to make\nup for the part.  D'ye understand?\"\n\n\"No,\" I ses, looking at 'im.\n\n\"I want to look the real thing,\" he ses, speaking low so the landlord\nshouldn't hear.  \"I want to make myself the living image of you.  If\nthat don't fetch 'em I'll give up the stage and grow cabbages.\"\n\n\"Make yourself like me?\"  I ses.  \"Why, you're no more like me than I'm\nlike a sea-sick monkey.\"\n\n\"Not so much,\" he ses.  \"That's where the art comes in.\"\n\nHe stood me another drink, and then, taking my arm in a cuddling sort o'\nway, and calling me \"Dear boy,\" 'e led me back to the wharf and\nexplained.  He said 'e would come round next evening with wot 'e called\nhis make-up box, and paint 'is face and make 'imself up till people\nwouldn't know one from the other.\n\n\"And wot about your figger?\"  I ses, looking at 'im.\n\n\"A cushion,\" he ses, winking, \"or maybe a couple.  And what about\nclothes?  You'll 'ave to sell me those you've got on.  Hat and all.  And\nboots.\"\n\nI put a price on 'em that I thought would 'ave finished 'im then and\nthere, but it didn't.  And at last, arter paying me so many more\ncompliments that they began to get into my 'ead, he fixed up a meeting\nfor the next night and went off.\n\n\"And mind,\" he ses, coming back, \"not a word to a living soul!\"\n\nHe went off agin, and, arter going to the Bull's Head and 'aving a pint\nto clear my 'ead, I went and sat down in the office and thought it over.\nIt seemed all right to me as far as I could see; but p'r'aps the pint\ndidn't clear my 'ead enough--p'r'aps I ought to 'ave 'ad two pints.\n\nI lay awake best part of next day thinking it over, and when I got up I\n'ad made up my mind.  I put my clothes in a sack, and then I put on some\nothers as much like 'em as possible, on'y p'r'aps a bit older, in case\nthe missis should get asking questions; and then I sat wondering 'ow to\nget out with the sack without 'er noticing it.  She's got a very\ninquiring mind, and I wasn't going to tell her any lies about it.\nBesides which I couldn't think of one.\n\nI got out at last by playing a game on her.  I pertended to drop 'arf a\ndollar in the washus, and while she was busy on 'er hands and knees I\nwent off as comfortable as you please.\n\nI got into the office with it all right, and, just as it was getting\ndark, a cab drove up to the wharf and the actor-chap jumped out with a\nbig leather bag.  I took 'im into the private office, and 'e was so\nready with 'is money for the clothes that I offered to throw the sack\nin.\n\nHe changed into my clothes fust of all, and then, asking me to sit down\nin front of 'im, he took a looking-glass and a box out of 'is bag and\nbegan to alter 'is face.  Wot with sticks of coloured paint, and false\neyebrows, and a beard stuck on with gum and trimmed with a pair o'\nscissors, it was more like a conjuring trick than anything else.  Then\n'e took a wig out of 'is bag and pressed it on his 'ead, put on the cap,\nput some black stuff on 'is teeth, and there he was.  We both looked\ninto the glass together while 'e gave the finishing touches, and then he\nclapped me on the back and said I was the handsomest sailorman in\nEngland.\n\n\"I shall have to make up a bit 'eavier when I'm behind the floats,\" he\nses; \"but this is enough for 'ere.  Wot do you think of the imitation of\nyour voice?  I think I've got it exact.\"\n\n\"If you ask me,\" I ses, \"it sounds like a poll-parrot with a cold in the\n'ead.\"\n\n\"And now for your walk,\" he ses, looking as pleased as if I'd said\nsomething else.  \"Come to the door and see me go up the wharf.\"\n\nI didn't like to hurt 'is feelings, but I thought I should ha' bust.  He\nwalked up that wharf like a dancing-bear in a pair of trousers too tight\nfor it, but 'e was so pleased with 'imself that I didn't like to tell\n'im so.  He went up and down two or three times, and I never saw\nanything so ridikerlous in my life.\n\n\"That's all very well for us,\" he ses; \"but wot about other people?\nThat's wot I want to know.  I'll go and 'ave a drink, and see whether\nanybody spots me.\"\n\nAfore I could stop 'im he started off to the Bull's Head and went in,\nwhile I stood outside and watched 'im.\n\n\"'Arf a pint o' four ale,\" he ses, smacking down a penny.\n\nI see the landlord draw the beer and give it to 'im, but 'e didn't seem\nto take no notice of 'im.  Then, just to open 'is eyes a bit, I walked\nin and put down a penny and asked for a 'arf-pint.\n\nThe landlord was just wiping down the counter at the time, and when I\ngave my order he looked up and stood staring at me with the wet cloth\n'eld up in the air.  He didn't say a word--not a single word.  He stood\nthere for a moment smiling at us foolish-like, and then 'e let go o' the\nbeer-injin, wot 'e was 'olding in 'is left hand, and sat down heavy on\nthe bar floor.  We both put our 'eads over the counter to see wot had\n'appened to 'im, and 'e started making the most 'orrible noise I 'ave\never heard in my life.  I wonder it didn't bring the fire-injins.  The\nactor-chap bolted out as if he'd been shot, and I was just thinking of\nfollering 'im when the landlord's wife and 'is two daughters came\nrushing out and asking me wot I 'ad done to him.\n\n\"There--there--was two of 'im !\"  ses the landlord, trembling and\nholding on to 'is wife's arm, as they helped 'im up and got 'im in the\nchair. \"Two of 'im!\"\n\n\"Two of wot?\"  ses his wife.\n\n\"Two--two watchmen,\" ses the landlord; \"both exac'ly alike and both\nasking for 'arf a pint o' four ale.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" ses 'is wife.\n\n\"You come and lay down, pa,\" ses the gals.  \"I tell you there was,\" ses\nthe landlord, getting 'is colour back, with temper.\n\n\"Yes, yes; I know all about it,\" ses 'is wife.  \"You come inside for a\nbit; and, Gertie, you bring your father in a soda--a large soda.\"\n\nThey got 'im in arter a lot o' trouble; but three times 'e came back as\nfar as the door, 'olding on to them, and taking a little peep at me.\nThe last time he shook his 'ead at me, and said if I did it agin I could\ngo and get my 'arf-pints somewhere else.\n\nI finished the beer wot the actor 'ad left, and, arter telling the\nlandlord I 'oped his eyesight 'ud be better in the morning, I went\noutside, and arter a careful look round walked back to the wharf.\n\nI pushed the wicket open a little way and peeped in.  The actor was\nstanding just by the fust crane talking to two of the hands off of the\nSaltram.  He'd got 'is back to the light, but 'ow it was they didn't\ntwig his voice I can't think.\n\nThey was so busy talking that I crept along by the side of the wall and\ngot to the office without their seeing me.  I went into the private\noffice and turned out the gas there, and sat down to wait for 'im.  Then\nI 'eard a noise outside that took me to the door agin and kept me there,\n'olding on to the door-post and gasping for my breath.  The cook of the\nSaltram was sitting on a paraffin-cask playing the mouth-orgin, and the\nactor, with 'is arms folded across his stummick, was dancing a horn-pipe\nas if he'd gorn mad.\n\nI never saw anything so ridikerlous in my life, and when I recollected\nthat they thought it was me, I thought I should ha' dropped.\n\nA night-watchman can't be too careful, and I knew that it 'ud be all\nover Wapping next morning that I 'ad been dancing to a tuppenny-ha'penny\nmouth-orgin played by a ship's cook.  A man that does 'is dooty always\nhas a lot of people ready to believe the worst of 'im.\n\nI went back into the dark office and waited, and by and by I 'eard them\ncoming along to the gate and patting 'im on the back and saying he ought\nto be in a pantermime instead o' wasting 'is time night-watching.  He\nleft 'em at the gate, and then 'e came into the office smiling as if\nhe'd done something clever.\n\n\"Wot d'ye think of me for a understudy?\"  he ses, laughing.  \"They all\nthought it was you.  There wasn't one of 'em 'ad the slightest suspicion\n--not one.\"\n\n\"And wot about my character?\"  I ses, folding my arms acrost my chest\nand looking at him.\n\n\"Character?\" he ses, staring.  \"Why, there's no 'arm in dancing; it's a\ninnercent enjoyment.\"\n\n\"It ain't one o' my innercent enjoyments,\" I ses, \"and I don't want to\nget the credit of it.  If they hadn't been sitting in a pub all the\nevening they'd 'ave spotted you at once.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" he ses, very huffy.  \"How?\"\n\n\"Your voice,\" I ses.  \"You try and mimic a poll-parrot, and think it's\nlike me.  And, for another thing, you walk about as though you're\nstuffed with sawdust.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he ses; \"the voice and the walk are exact.  Exact.\"\n\n\"Wot?\" I ses, looking 'im up and down.  \"You stand there and 'ave the\nimpudence to tell me that my voice is like that?\"\n\n\"I do,\" he ses.\n\n\"Then I'm sorry for you,\" I ses.  \"I thought you'd got more sense.\"\n\nHe stood looking at me and gnawing 'is finger, and by and by he ses,\n\"Are you married?\"  he ses.\n\n\"I am,\" I ses, very short.\n\n\"Where do you live?\" he ses.\n\nI told 'im.\n\n\"Very good,\" he ses; \"p'r'aps I'll be able to convince you arter all.\nBy the way, wot do you call your wife?  Missis?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I ses, staring at him.  \"But wot's it got to do with you?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" he ses.  \"Nothing.  Only I'm going to try the poll-parrot\nvoice and the sawdust walk on her, that's all.  If I can deceive 'er\nthat'll settle it.\"\n\n\"Deceive her?\"  I ses.  \"Do you think I'm going to let you go round to\nmy 'ouse and get me into trouble with the missis like that?  Why, you\nmust be crazy; that dancing must 'ave got into your 'ead.\"\n\n\"Where's the 'arm?\"  he ses, very sulky.\n\n\"'Arm?\"  I ses.  \"I won't 'ave it, that's all; and if you knew my missis\nyou'd know without any telling.\"\n\n\"I'll bet you a pound to a sixpence she wouldn't know me,\" he ses, very\nearnest.\n\n\"She won't 'ave the chance,\" I ses, \"so that's all about it.\"\n\nHe stood there argufying for about ten minutes; but I was as firm as a\nrock.  I wouldn't move an inch, and at last, arter we was both on the\npoint of losing our tempers, he picked up his bag and said as 'ow he\nmust be getting off 'ome.\n\n\"But ain't you going to take those things off fust?\"  I ses.\n\n\"No,\" he ses, smiling.  \"I'll wait till I get 'ome.  Ta-ta.\"\n\nHe put 'is bag on 'is shoulder and walked to the gate, with me follering\nof 'im.\n\n\"I expect I shall see a cab soon,\" he ses.  \"Good-bye.\"\n\n\"Wot are you laughing at?\"  I ses.\n\n\"On'y thoughts,\" he ses.\n\n\"'Ave you got far to go?' I ses.\n\n\"No; just about the same distance as you 'ave,\" he ses, and he went off\nspluttering like a soda-water bottle.\n\nI took the broom and 'ad a good sweep-up arter he 'ad gorn, and I was\njust in the middle of it when the cook and the other two chaps from the\nSaltram came back, with three other sailormen and a brewer's drayman\nthey 'ad brought to see me DANCE!\n\n\"Same as you did a little while ago, Bill,\" ses the cook, taking out 'is\nbeastly mouth-orgin and wiping it on 'is sleeve.  \"Wot toon would you\nlike?\"\n\nI couldn't get away from 'em, and when I told them I 'ad never danced in\nmy life the cook asked me where I expected to go to.  He told the\ndrayman that I'd been dancing like a fairy in sea-boots, and they all\ngot in front of me and wouldn't let me pass.  I lost my temper at last,\nand, arter they 'ad taken the broom away from me and the drayman and one\no' the sailormen 'ad said wot they'd do to me if I was on'y fifty years\nyounger, they sheered off.\n\nI locked the gate arter 'em and went back to the office, and I 'adn't\nbeen there above 'arf an hour when somebody started ringing the gate-\nbell as if they was mad.  I thought it was the cook's lot come back at\nfust, so I opened the wicket just a trifle and peeped out.  There was a\n'ansom-cab standing outside, and I 'ad hardly got my nose to the crack\nwhen the actor-chap, still in my clothes, pushed the door open and\nnipped in.\n\n\"You've lost,\" he ses, pushing the door to and smiling all over.\n\"Where's your sixpence?\"\n\n\"Lost?\"  I ses, hardly able to speak.  \"D'ye mean to tell me you've been\nto my wife arter all--arter all I said to you?\"\n\n\"I do,\" he ses, nodding, and smiling agin.  \"They were both deceived as\neasy as easy.\"\n\n\"Both?\" I ses, staring at 'im.  \"Both wot?  'Ow many wives d'ye think\nI've got?  Wot d'ye mean by it?\"\n\n\"Arter I left you,\" he ses, giving me a little poke in the ribs, \"I\npicked up a cab and, fust leaving my bag at Aldgate, I drove on to your\n'ouse and knocked at the door.  I knocked twice, and then an angry-\nlooking woman opened it and asked me wot I wanted.\n\n\"'It's all right, missis,' I ses.  'I've got 'arf an hour off, and I've\ncome to take you out for a walk.'\n\n\"'Wot?' she ses, drawing back with a start.\n\n\"'Just a little turn round to see the shops,' I ses; 'and if there's\nanything particler you'd like and it don't cost too much, you shall 'ave\nit.'\n\n\"I thought at fust, from the way she took it, she wasn't used to you\ngiving 'er things.\n\n\"'Ow dare you!' she ses.  'I'll 'ave you locked up.  'Ow dare you insult\na respectable married woman!  You wait till my 'usband comes 'ome.'\n\n\"'But I am your 'usband,' I ses.  'Don't you know me, my pretty?  Don't\nyou know your pet sailor-boy?'\n\n\"She gave a screech like a steam-injin, and then she went next door and\nbegan knocking away like mad.  Then I see that I 'ad gorn to number\ntwelve instead of number fourteen.  Your wife, your real wife, came out\nof number fourteen--and she was worse than the other.  But they both\nthought it was you--there's no doubt of that.  They chased me all the\nway up the road, and if it 'adn't ha' been for this cab that was just\npassing I don't know wot would 'ave 'appened to me.\"\n\nHe shook his 'ead and smiled agin, and, arter opening the wicket a\ntrifle and telling the cabman he shouldn't be long, he turned to me and\nasked me for the sixpence, to wear on his watch-chain.\n\n\"Sixpence!\" I ses.  \"SIXPENCE!\"  Wot do you think is going to 'appen to\nme when I go 'ome?\"\n\n\"Oh, I 'adn't thought o' that,\" he ses.  \"Yes, o' course.\"\n\n\"Wot about my wife's jealousy?\"  I ses.  \"Wot about the other, and her\n'usband, a cooper as big as a 'ouse?\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" he ses, \"one can't think of everything.  It'll be all the\nsame a hundred years hence.\"\n\n\"Look 'ere,\" I ses, taking 'is shoulder in a grip of iron.  \"You come\nback with me now in that cab and explain.  D'ye see?  That's wot you've\ngot to do.\"\n\n\"All right,\" he ses; \"certainly.  Is--is the husband bad-tempered?\"\n\n\"You'll see,\" I ses; \"but that's your business.  Come along.\"\n\n\"With pleasure,\" he ses, 'elping me in.  \"'Arf a mo' while I tell the\ncabby where to drive to.\"\n\nHe went to the back o' the cab, and afore I knew wot had 'appened the\n'orse had got a flick over the head with the whip and was going along at\na gallop.  I kept putting the little flap up and telling the cabby to\nstop, but he didn't take the slightest notice.  Arter I'd done it three\ntimes he kept it down so as I couldn't open it.\n\nThere was a crowd round my door when the cab drove up, and in the middle\nof it was my missis, the woman next door, and 'er husband, wot 'ad just\ncome 'ome.  'Arf a dozen of 'em helped me out, and afore I could say a\nword the cabman drove off and left me there.\n\nI dream of it now sometimes: standing there explaining and explaining,\nuntil, just as I feel I can't bear it any longer, two policemen come up\nand 'elp me indoors.  If they had 'elped my missis outside it would be a\neasier dream to have.",
