    "body": "\n\nAN ADULTERATION ACT\n\n\nDr. Frank Carson had been dreaming tantalizing dreams of cooling,\neffervescent beverages.  Over and over again in his dreams he had risen\nfrom his bed, and tripping lightly down to the surgery in his pajamas,\nmixed himself something long and cool and fizzy, without being able to\nbring the dream to a satisfactory termination.\n\nWith a sudden start he awoke.  The thirst was still upon him; the\nmaterials for quenching it, just down one flight of stairs.  He would\nhave smacked his lips at the prospect if they had been moist enough to\nsmack; as it was, he pushed down the bedclothes, and throwing one leg out\nof bed-became firmly convinced that he was still dreaming.\n\nFor the atmosphere was stifling and odorous, and the ceiling descended in\nan odd bulging curve to within a couple of feet of his head.  Still half\nasleep, he raised his fist and prodded at it in astonishment--a feeling\nwhich gave way to one of stupefaction as the ceiling took another shape\nand swore distinctly.\n\n\"I must be dreaming,\" mused the doctor; \"even the ceiling seems alive.\"\n\nHe prodded it again-regarding it closely this time.  The ceiling at once\nrose to greater altitudes, and at the same moment an old face with bushy\nwhiskers crawled under the edge of it, and asked him profanely what he\nmeant by it.  It also asked him whether he wanted something for himself,\nbecause, if so, he was going the right way to work.\n\n\"Where am I?\" demanded the bewildered doctor.  \"Mary! Mary!\"\n\nHe started up in bed, and brought his head in sudden violent contact with\nthe ceiling.  Then, before the indignant ceiling could carry out its\nthreat of a moment before, he slipped out of bed and stood on a floor\nwhich was in its place one moment and somewhere else the next.\n\nIn the smell of bilge-water, tar, and the foetid atmosphere generally his\nclouded brain awoke to the fact that he was on board ship, but resolutely\ndeclined to inform him how he got there.  He looked down in disgust at\nthe ragged clothes which he had on in lieu of the usual pajamas; and\nthen, as events slowly pieced themselves together in his mind,\nremembered, as the last thing that he could remember, that he had warned\nhis friend Harry Thomson, solicitor, that if he had any more to drink it\nwould not be good for him.\n\nHe wondered dimly as he stood whether Thomson was there too, and walking\nunsteadily round the forecastle, roused the sleepers, one by one, and\nasked them whether they were Harry Thomson, all answering with much\nfluency in the negative, until he came to one man who for some time made\nno answer at all.\n\nThe doctor shook him first and then punched him.  Then he shook him again\nand gave him little scientific slaps, until at length Harry Thomson, in a\nfar-away voice, said that he was all right.\n\n\"Well, I'm glad I'm not alone,\" said the doctor, selfishly. \"_Harry!\nHarry!  Wake up!_\"\n\n\"All ri'!\" said the sleeper; \"I'm all ri'!\"\n\nThe doctor shook him again, and then rolled him backward and forward in\nhis bunk.  Under this gentle treatment the solicitor's faculties were\nsomewhat brightened, and, half opening his eyes, he punched viciously at\nthe disturber of his peace, until threatening voices from the gloom\npromised to murder both of them.\n\n\"Where are we?\"  demanded the doctor, of a deep voice from the other side\nof the forecastle which had been particularly threatening.\n\n\"Barque _Stella,_ o' course,\" was the reply.  \"Where'd you think you\nwas?\"\n\nThe doctor gripped the edge of his friend's bunk and tried to think;\nthen, a feeling of nausea overcoming all others, he clambered hurriedly\nup the forecastle ladder and lurched to the side of the vessel.\n\nHe leaned there for some time without moving, a light breeze cooling his\nfevered brow, and a small schooner some little distance from them playing\nseesaw, as he closed his eyes to the heaving blue sea.  Land was\nconspicuous by its absence, and with a groan he turned and looked about\nhim--at the white scrubbed deck, the snowy canvas towering aloft on\nlazily creaking spars, and the steersman leaning against the wheel\nregarding the officer who stood near by.\n\nDr. Carson, feeling a little better, walked sternly aft, the officer\nturning round and glancing in surprise at his rags as he approached.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" began the doctor, in superior tones.\n\n\"And what the devil do you want?\"  demanded the second officer; \"who told\nyou to come along here?\"\n\n\"I want to know what this means,\" said the doctor, fiercely.  \"How dare\nyou kidnap us on your beastly bilge-tank?\"\n\n\"Man's mad,\" murmured the astonished second officer.\n\n\"Insufferable outrage!\"  continued the doctor.  \"Take us back to\nMelbourne at once.\"\n\n\"You get for'ard,\" said the other sharply; \"get for'ard, and don't let me\nhave any more of your lip.\"\n\n\"I want to see the captain of this ship,\" cried the doctor; \"go and fetch\nhim at once.\"\n\nThe second officer gazed at him, limp with astonishment, and then turned\nto the steersman, as though unable to believe his ears.  The steersman\npointed in front of him, and the other gave a cry of surprise and rage as\nhe saw another tatterdemalion coming with uncertain steps toward him.\n\n\"Carson,\" said the new arrival, feebly; and coming closer to his friend,\nclung to him miserably.\n\n\"I'm just having it out with 'em, Thomson,\" said the doctor,\nenergetically.  \"My friend here is a solicitor.  Tell him what 'll happen\nif they don't take us back, Harry.\"\n\n\"You seem to be unaware, my good fellow,\" said the solicitor, covering a\nlarge hole in the leg of his trousers with his hand, \"of the very\ndangerous situation in which you have placed yourselves.  We have no\ndesire to be harsh with you--\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" acquiesced the doctor, nodding at the second officer.\n\n\"At the same time,\" continued Mr. Thomson--\"at the--\"  He let go his\nfriend's arm and staggered away; the doctor gazed after him\nsympathetically.\n\n\"His digestion is not all it should be,\" he said to the second officer,\nconfidentially.\n\n\"If you don't get for'ard in two twos,\" said that gentleman, explosively,\n\"I'll knock your heads off.\"\n\nThe doctor gazed at him in haughty disdain, and taking the limp Thomson\nby the arm, led him slowly away.\n\n\"How did we get here?\"  asked Mr. Harry Thomson, feebly.\n\nThe doctor shook his head.\n\n\"How did we get these disgusting clothes on?\" continued his friend.\n\nThe doctor shook his head again.  \"The last thing I can remember, Harry,\"\nhe said, slowly, \"was imploring you not to drink any more.\"\n\n\"I didn't hear you,\" said the solicitor, crustily; \"your speech was very\nindistinct last night.\"\n\n\"Seemed so to you, I dare say,\" said the other.\n\nMr. Thomson shook his arm off, and clinging to the mainmast, leaned his\ncheek against it and closed his eyes.  He opened them again at the sound\nof voices, and drew himself up as he saw the second officer coming along\nwith a stern-visaged man of about fifty.\n\n\"Are you the master of this vessel?\"  inquired the doctor, stepping to\nhis friend's side.\n\n\"What the blazes has that got to do with you?\"  demanded the skipper.\n\"Look here, my lads; don't you play any of your little games on me,\nbecause they won't do.  You're both of you as drunk as owls.\"\n\n\"Defamation of character,\" said the solicitor, feebly, to his friend.\n\n\"Allow me,\" said the doctor, with his best manner, \"to inquire what all\nthis means.  I am Dr. Frank Carson, of Melbourne; this gentleman is my\nfriend Mr. Thomson, of the same place, solicitor.\"\n\n\"What?\" roared the skipper, the veins in his forehead standing out.\n\"Doctor!  Solicitor!  Why, you damned rascals, you shipped with me as\ncook and A. B.\"\n\n\"There's some mistake,\" said the doctor.  \"I'm afraid I shall have to ask\nyou to take us back.  I hope you haven't come far.\"\n\n\"Take those scarecrows away,\" cried the skipper, hoarsely; \"take them\naway before I do them a mischief.  I'll have the law of somebody for\nshipping two useless lubbers as seamen.  Look to me like pickpockets.\"\n\n\"You shall answer for this,\" said Carson, foaming; \"we're professional\nmen, and we're not going to be abused by a bargee.\"\n\n\"Let him talk,\" said Mr. Thomson, hurriedly drawing his friend away from\nthe irate skipper.  \"Let him talk.\"\n\n\"I'll put you both in quod when we get to Hong-kong,\" said the skipper.\n\"Meantime, no work, no food; d'ye hear?  Start and cook the breakfast,\nMr. Doctor; and you.  Mr. Lawyer, turn to and ask the boy to teach you an\nA. B's duties.\"\n\nHe walked back to the cabin; and the new cook was slowly pushed toward\nthe galley by the second officer, the new A. B., under the same gentle\nguidance, being conducted back to the forecastle.\n\nFortunately for the new seamen the weather continued fine, but the heat\nof the galley was declared by the new cook to be insupportable.  From the\nother hands they learned that they had been shipped with several others\nby a resourceful boarding-house master.  The other hands, being men of\nplain speech, also said that they were brought aboard in a state of\nbeastly and enviable intoxication, and chaffed crudely when the doctor\nattributed their apparent state of intoxication to drugs.\n\n\"You say you're a doctor?\"  said the oldest seaman.\n\n\"I am,\" said Carson, fiercely.\n\n\"Wot sort of a doctor are you, if you don't know when your licker's been\nplayed with, then?\" asked the old man, as a grin passed slowly from mouth\nto mouth.\n\n\"I suppose it is because I drink so seldom,\" said the doctor, loftily.\n\"I hardly know the taste of liquor myself, while as for my friend Mr.\nThomson, you might almost call him a teetotaler.\n\n\"Next door to one,\" said the solicitor, who was sewing a patch on his\ntrousers, as he looked up approvingly.\n\n\"You might call 'im a sailor, if you liked,\" said another seaman, \"but\nthat wouldn't make him one.  All I can say is I never 'ad enough time or\nmoney to get in the state you was both in when you come aboard.\"\n\nIf the forecastle was incredulous, the cabin was worse.  The officers at\nfirst took but little notice of them, but feeling their torn and tattered\nappearance was against them, they put on so many airs and graces to\ncounteract this that flesh and blood could not endure it quietly.  The\ncook would allude to his friend as Mr. Thomson, while the A. B.  would\npersist in referring, with a most affected utterance, to Dr. Carson.\n\n\"Cook!\" bawled the skipper one day when they were about a week out.\n\nDr. Carson, who was peeling potatoes, stepped slowly out of the galley\nand went toward him.\n\n\"You say 'Sir,' when you're spoken to,\" said the skipper, fiercely.\n\nThe doctor sneered.\n\n\"My --- if you sneer at me, I'll knock your head off!\"  said the other,\nwith a wicked look.\n\n\"When you get back to Melbourne,\" said the doctor, quietly, \"you'll hear\nmore of this.\"\n\n\"You're a couple of pickpockets aping the gentleman,\" said the skipper,\nand he turned to the mate.  \"Mr. Mackenzie, what do these two ragamuffins\nlook like?\"\n\n\"Pickpockets,\" said the mate, dutifully.\n\n\"It's a very handy thing,\" said the old man, jeeringly, \"to have a doctor\naboard.  First time I've carried a surgeon.\"\n\nMr. Mackenzie guffawed loudly.\n\n\"And a solicitor,\" said the skipper, gazing darkly at the hapless Harry\nThomson, who was cleaning brasswork.  \"Handy in case of disputes.  He's a\nreal sea lawyer. _Cook!_\"\n\n\"Sir?\"  said the doctor, quietly.\n\n\"Go down and tidy my cabin, and see you do it well.\"\n\nThe doctor went below without a word, and worked like a housemaid.  When\nhe came on deck again, his face wore a smile almost of happiness, and his\nhand caressed one trousers pocket as though it concealed a hidden weapon.\n\nFor the following three or four days the two unfortunates were worked\nunceasingly.  Mr. Thomson complained bitterly, but the cook wore a\nsphinx-like smile and tried to comfort him.\n\n\"It won't be for long, Harry,\" he said, consolingly.\n\nThe solicitor sniffed.  \"I could write tract after tract on temperance,\"\nhe said, bitterly.  \"I wonder what our poor wives are thinking?  I expect\nthey have put us down as dead.\"\n\n\"Crying their eyes out,\" said the doctor, wistfully; \"but they'll dry\nthem precious quick when we get back, and ask all sorts of questions.\nWhat are you going to say, Harry?\"\n\n\"The truth,\" said the solicitor, virtuously.\n\n\"So am I,\" said his friend; \"but mind, we must both tell the same tale,\nwhatever it is.  Halloa! what's the matter?\"\n\n\"It's the skipper,\" said the boy, who had just run up; \"he wants to see\nyou at once.  He's dying.\"\n\nHe caught hold of the doctor by the sleeve; but Carson, in his most\nprofessional manner, declined to be hurried.  He went leisurely down the\ncompanion-ladder, and met with a careless glance the concerned faces of\nthe mate and second officer.\n\n\"Come to the skipper at once,\" said the mate.\n\n\"Does he want to see me?\"  said the doctor, languidly, as he entered the\ncabin.\n\nThe skipper was lying doubled up in his bunk, his face twisted with pain.\n\"Doctor,\" he panted, \"give me something quick.  There's the medicine-\nchest.\"\n\n\"Do you want some food, sir?\"  inquired the other, respectfully.\n\n\"Food be damned!\" said the sufferer.  \"I want physic.  There's the\nmedicine-chest.\"  The doctor took it up and held it out to him.  \"I don't\nwant the lot,\" moaned the skipper.\n\n\"I want you to give me something for red-hot corkscrews in the inside.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said the doctor, humbly; \"I'm only the cook.\"\n\n\"If you--don't--prescribe for me at once,\" said the skipper, \"I'll put\nyou in irons.\"\n\nThe doctor shook his head.  \"I shipped as cook,\" he said, slowly.\n\n\"Give me something, for Heaven's sake!\" said the skipper, humbly.  \"I'm\ndying.\"  The doctor pondered.\n\n\"If you dinna treat him at once, I'll break your skull,\" said the mate,\npersuasively.\n\nThe doctor regarded him scornfully, and turned to the writhing skipper.\n\n\"My fee is half a guinea a visit,\" he said, softly; \"five shillings if\nyou come to me.\"\n\n\"I'll have half a guinea's worth,\" said the agonized skipper.\n\nThe doctor took his wrist, and calmly drew the second officer's watch\nfrom its owner's pocket.  Then he inspected the sick man's tongue, and\nshaking his head, selected a powder from the chest.\n\n\"You mustn't mind its being nasty,\" he said.  \"Where's a spoon?\"\n\nHe looked round for one, but the skipper took the powder from his hand,\nand licked it from the paper as though it had been sherbet.\n\n\"For mercy's sake don't say it's cholera,\" he gasped.\n\n\"I won't say anything,\" said the doctor.  \"Where did you say the money\nwas?\"\n\nThe skipper pointed to his trousers, and Mr. Mackenzie, his national\nspirit rising in hot rage, took out the agreed amount and handed it to\nthe physician.\n\n\"Am I in danger?\"  said the skipper.\n\n\"There's always danger,\" said the doctor, in his best bedside manner.\n\"Have you made your will?\"\n\nThe other, turning pale, shook his head.  \"Perhaps you'd like to see a\nsolicitor?\" said Carson, in winning tones.\n\n\"I'm not bad enough for that,\" said the skipper, stoutly.\n\n\"You must stay here and nurse the skipper, Mr. Mackenzie,\" said Carson,\nturning to the mate; \"and be good enough not to make that snuffling\nnoise; it's worrying to an invalid.\"\n\n\"Snuffling noise?\"  repeated the horror-struck mate.\n\n\"Yes; you've got an unpleasant habit of snuffling,\" said the doctor; \"it\nworries me sometimes, I meant to speak to you about it before.  You\nmustn't do it here.  If you want to snuffle, go and snuffle on deck.\"\n\nThe frenzied outburst of the mate was interrupted by the skipper.  \"Don't\nmake that noise in my cabin, Mr. Mackenzie,\" he said, severely.\n\nBoth mates withdrew in dudgeon, and Carson, after arranging the\nsufferer's bedclothes, quitted the cabin and sought his friend.  Mr.\nThomson was at first incredulous, but his eyes glistened brightly at the\nsight of the half-sovereign.\n\n\"Better hide it,\" he said, apprehensively; \"the skipper 'll have it back\nwhen he gets well; it's the only coin we've got.\"\n\n\"He won't get well,\" said Dr. Carson, easily; \"not till we get to Hong-\nkong, that is.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with him?\"  whispered the solicitor.\n\nThe doctor, evading his eye, pulled a long face and shook his head.  \"It\nmay be the cooking,\" he said, slowly.  \"I'm not a good cook, I admit.  It\nmight be something got into the food from the medicine-chest.  I\nshouldn't be at all surprised if the mates are taken bad too.\"\n\nAnd indeed at that very moment the boy came rushing to the galley again,\nbawling out that Mr. Mackenzie was lying flat on his stomach in his bunk,\npunching the air with his fists and rending it with his language.  The\nsecond officer appeared on deck as he finished his tale, and glancing\nforward, called out loudly for the cook.\n\n\"You're wanted, Frank,\" said the solicitor.\n\n\"When he calls me doctor, I'll go,\" said the other, stiffly.\n\n\"_Cook!_\" bawled the second officer.  \"_Cook!_  COOK!\"\n\nHe came running forward, his face red and angry, and his fist doubled.\n\"Didn't you hear me calling you?\"  he demanded, fiercely.\n\n\"I've been promoted,\" said Carson, sweetly.  \"I'm ship's surgeon now.\"\n\n\"Come down below at once, or I'll take you there by the scruff of your\nneck,\" vociferated the other.\n\n\"You're not big enough, little man,\" said the doctor, still smiling.\n\"Well, well, lead the way, and we'll see what we can do.\"\n\nHe followed the speechless second officer below, and found the boy's\ndescription of the first officer's state as moonlight unto sunlight, as\nwater unto wine.  Even the second officer was appalled at the spectacle,\nand ventured a protest.\n\n\"Gie me something at once,\" yelled Mr. Mackenzie.\n\n\"Do you wish me to undertake your case?\"  inquired the doctor, suavely.\n\nMr. Mackenzie said that he did, in seven long, abusive, and wicked\nsentences.\n\n\"My fee is half a guinea,\" said the doctor, softly, poor people who\ncannot afford more, mates and the like, I sometimes treat for less.\"\n\n\"I'll die first,\" howled the mate; \"you won't get any money out of me.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said the doctor, and rose to depart.\n\n\"Bring him back, Rogers,\" yelled the mate; \"don't let him go.\"\n\nBut the second officer, with a strange awesome look in his eyes, was\nleaning back in his seat, tightly gripping the edge of the table in both\nhands.\n\n\"Come, come,\" said the doctor, cheerily--\"what's this?  You mustn't be\nill, Rogers.  I want you to nurse these other two.\"\n\nThe other rose slowly to his feet and eyed him with lack-lustre eyes.\n\"Tell the third officer to take charge,\" he said, slowly; \"and if he's to\nhe nurse as well, he's got his hands full.\"\n\nThe doctor sent the boy to apprise the third officer of his\nresponsibilities, and then stood watching the extraordinary and snakelike\nconvolutions of Mr. Mackenzie.\n\n\"How much--did--ye say?\"  hissed the latter.\n\n\"Poor people,\" repeated the doctor, with relish, \"five shillings a visit;\nvery poor people, half a crown.\"\n\n\"I'll have half a crown's worth,\" moaned the miserable mate.\n\n\"Mr. Mackenzie,\" said a faint voice from the skipper's cabin.\n\n\"Sir?\"  yelled the mate, who was in torment.\n\n\"Don't answer me like that, sir,\" said the skipper, sharply.  \"Will you\nplease to remember that I'm ill, and can't bear that horrible noise\nyou're making?\"\n\n\"I'm--ill--too,\" gasped the mate.\n\n\"Ill?  Nonsense!\"  said the skipper, severely.  \"We can't both be ill.\nHow about the ship?\"\n\nThere was no reply, but from another cabin the voice of Mr. Rogers was\nheard calling wildly for medical aid, and offering impossible sums in\nexchange for it.  The doctor went from cabin to cabin, and, first\ncollecting his fees, administered sundry potions to the sufferers; and\nthen, in his capacity of cook, went forward and made an unsavory mess he\ncalled gruel, which he insisted upon their eating.\n\nThanks to his skill, the invalids were freed from the more violent of\ntheir pains, but this freedom was followed by a weakness so alarming that\nthey could hardly raise their heads from their pillows--a state of things\nwhich excited the intense envy of the third officer, who, owing to his\nresponsibilities, might just as well have been without one.\n\nIn this state of weakness, and with the fear of impending dissolution\nbefore his eyes, the skipper sent for Mr. Harry Thomson, and after some\ncomparisons between lawyers and sharks, in which stress was laid upon\ncertain redeeming features of the latter, paid a guinea and made his\nwill.  His example, save in the amount of the fee, was followed by the\nmate; but Mr. Rogers, being approached tentatively by the doctor in his\nfriend's behalf, shook his head and thanked his stars he had nothing to\nleave.  He had enjoyed his money, he said.\n\nThey mended slowly as they approached Hong-kong, though a fit of temper\non Mr. Mackenzie's part, during which he threw out ominous hints about\nhaving his money back, led to a regrettable relapse in his case.  He was\nstill in bed when they came to anchor in the harbour; but the skipper and\nhis second officer were able to go above and exchange congratulations\nfrom adjoining deck-chairs.\n\n\"You are sure it wasn't cholera?\" asked the harbour-master's deputy, who\nhad boarded them in his launch, after he had heard the story.\n\n\"Positive,\" said Carson.\n\n\"Very fortunate thing they had you on board,\" said the deputy--\"very\nfortunate.\"\n\nThe doctor bowed.\n\n\"Seems so odd, the three of them being down with it,\" said the other;\n\"looks as though it's infectious, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" said the doctor, accepting with alacrity an offer to\ngo ashore in the launch and change into some decent clothes.  \"I think I\nknow what it was.\"\n\nThe captain of the _Stella_ pricked up his ears, and the second officer\nleaned forward with parted lips.  Carson, accompanied by the deputy and\nthe solicitor, walked toward the launch.\n\n\"What was it?\"  cried the skipper, anxiously.\n\n\"I think that you ate something that disagreed with you,\" replied the\ndoctor, grinning meaningly.  \"Good-by, captain.\"\n\nThe master of the _Stella_ made no reply, but rising feebly, tottered to\nthe side, and shook his fist at the launch as it headed for the shore.\nDoctor Carson, who had had a pious upbringing, kissed his hand in return.",
