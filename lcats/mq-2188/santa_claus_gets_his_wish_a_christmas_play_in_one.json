    "body": "_Author of \"The Submarine Shell,\" \"The Air-Spy,\" etc._\n\n\nEight male, four female characters. Costumes, modern; scenery, two easy\ninteriors. Plays a full evening. Royalty for amateur performance, $10.00\nfor the first and $5.00 each for subsequent performances by the same\ncompany. Free for school performance. George Clifford, incapacitated for\nservice at the front, employs his great talents as a conjurer to raise\nmoney for the soldiers. He is utilized by Inspector Steele, of the U. S.\nSecret Service, in a plan to discover certain foreign spies. The plan\ngoes wrong and involves seven persons in suspicion of a serious crime.\nClifford's clever unravelling of this tangled skein constitutes the\nthrilling plot of this play, the interest of which is curiously like\nthat of the popular \"Thirteenth Chair.\" This is not a \"war-play\" save in\na very remote and indirect way, but a clever detective story of\nabsorbing interest. Strongly recommended.\n\n_Price, 35 cents_\n\n\nCHARACTERS\n\n  INSPECTOR MALCOME STEELE.\n  GEORGE CLIFFORD.\n  CAPTAIN FRANK DRUMMOND GLEASON.\n  LIEUTENANT HAMILTON WARWICK.\n  COLONEL WILLARD ANDERSON.\n  DRISCOLL WELLS.\n  DOCTOR GORDON PEAK.\n  DETECTIVE WHITE.\n  MARION ANDERSON.\n  EDITH ANDERSON.\n  ELLEN GLEASON.\n  DOROTHY ELMSTROM.\n\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nACT I.--The home of Colonel Anderson (Friday evening).\n\nACT II.--The office of Inspector Steele (Saturday afternoon).\n\nACT III.--The same as Act II (Saturday evening).\n\n\n\n\nTHE OTHER VOICE\n\nA Play in One Act\n\n\nThree voices, preferably male, are employed in this little novelty which\nis intended to be presented upon a dark stage upon which nothing is\nactually visible save starlight. It was originally produced at Workshop\n47, Cambridge, where its effective distillation of the essential oil of\ntragedy was curiously successful. An admirable item for any programme\nseeking variety of material and effect. Naturally no costumes nor\nscenery are required, save a drop carrying stars and possibly a city\nsky-line. Plays ten minutes only; royalty, $5.00.\n\n_Price, 25 cents_\n\n\n\n\nA COUPLE OF MILLION\n\nAn American Comedy in Four Acts\n\nAuthor of \"Professor Pepp,\" \"Much Ado About Betty,\" \"The Hoodoo,\" \"The\nDutch Detective,\" etc.\n\n\nSix males, five females. Costumes, modern; scenery, two interiors and an\nexterior. Plays a full evening. Royalty, ten dollars ($10.00) for each\nperformance. A more ambitious play by this popular author in the same\nsuccessful vein as his previous offerings. Bemis Bennington is left two\nmillion dollars by his uncle on condition that he shall live for one\nyear in a town of less than five thousand inhabitants and during that\nperiod marry and earn without other assistance than his own industry and\nability the sum of five thousand dollars. Failing to accomplish this the\nmoney goes to one Professor Noah Jabb. This is done despite the\nenergetic opposition of Jabb, who puts up a very interesting fight. A\ncapital play that can be strongly recommended. Plenty of good comedy and\na great variety of good parts, full of opportunity.\n\n_Price, 35 cents_\n\n\nCHARACTERS\n\n  BEMIS BENNINGTON.\n  HON. JEREMY WISE.\n  JAMES PATRICK BURNS, \"_Stubby_.\"\n  PROFESSOR NOAH JABB.\n  BEVERLY LOMAN.\n  SQUIRE PIPER.\n  FAY FAIRBANKS.\n  MRS.

Costumes, modern; scene, an interior.\nPlays twenty minutes. Royalty $2.50 for each performance. An admirable\nlittle travesty of the conventional emotional recipe calling for\nhusband, wife and lover. Played in the proper spirit of burlesque it is\nhowlingly funny. Strongly recommended for the semi-professional uses of\nschools of acting. A capital bit for a benefit or exhibition programme,\noffering a decided novelty.\n\n_Price, 25 cents_\n\n\n\n\nNO TRESPASSING\n\nA Play in Three Acts\n\n\nSix males, five females.

He meets her by accident\nand takes her to be one of a pair of twins who have been living at the\nfarmhouse. She discovers his mistake and in the character of both twins\nin alternation gives him the time of his life, incidentally falling in\nlove with him.
