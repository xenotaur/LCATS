When we\n    Were tired, and lean, and shaking at the knee,\n    We put this bird in harness. He was strong\n    As any ostrich, pulled our packs along,\n    Helped us up over the next annoying wall,\n    And dragged us to the chalet, and the tourists\u2019 resting hall.\n\n    And when once more we were young, well-fed men,\n    He beat the door to call us forth again.\n\n\n\n\nTHE THISTLEVINE\n\n\n    The Thistlevine saw the butterflies\n    Disappear through the morning skies.\n\n\n\n\nAND THEY LAUGHED\n\n\n    By the mountain peak, called \u201cGoing-To-The-Sun,\u201d\n    A dizzy mountain, where paths twist round and round\n    And nothing in sober order can be found--\n    I asked the poppies: \u201cWhat fairies do you see?\u201d\n    And they shook their long stems, and they laughed at me.\n\nAND\nTHEY\nLAUGHED\n\nVACHEL LINDSAY 1922]\n\n\n\n\nTHE FAIRY CIRCUS\n\n\n    A fairy ran a circus\n      With a pigeon puffed and proud,\n    A humble bullfrog\n      And a rather solid cloud.\n\n    She wore her underwear,\n      The rest wore what they had,\n    The frog wore a blue coat\n      Just like his dad.\n\n    The pigeon wore his feathers\n      And spread himself--O My!\n    The cloud wore sunshine\n      He gathered in the sky.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BATTLE-AX OF THE SUN\n\n\n    On the mountain peak I reached the drift\n    And I took it for a Christmas gift,\n    And I made ten soldiers out of snow.\n\n    But the battle-ax of my fairy foe\n    Cut to the ground my men of snow.\n\n    And who was he, my fairy foe,\n    Who brought my snowy army low?\n\n    The mountain sun was my fairy foe.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CHRISTMAS TREES\n\n\n    On the high slope of Going-To-The-Sun\n    Is a stormy Christmas, all year round,\n    And snow-filled Christmas trees abound.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PHEASANT SPEAKS OF HIS BIRTHDAYS\n\n\n    Up the good slope of Going-To-The-Sun,\n    I saw the Pheasant-Of-The-Sunrise fly.\n    Jewels in his feathers, mixed with dew.\n    Dew and jewels made his jeweled eye.\n    He paused to make a sonnet, which he sang,\n    Though nowhere else are pheasants sonneteers.\n    He emphasized with swooping and with skipping,\n    With winkings and intoxicated leers.\n    And how the bushes twinkled as he caroled:\n\n    \u201cEach morning is another birthday, friend.\n    And I have lived so many happy birthdays!\n    There are gifts with all the suns that here ascend!\n    Each bush, you see, has an unextinguished candle\n    And angel-food, and icing, and candy flowers,\n    And this long vine that climbs from earth to heaven\n    Gives me thoughts, and most erratic powers.\n    I eat its scarlet berries and its frosting.\n    If I choose, it is my present every day.\n    Then I can fly straight up to heaven\u2019s doorstep\n    Following the green line all the way.\n\n    \u201cAnd then I tumble like a limber leaf\n    To my nest here, and another year is done\n    Or another thousand years, what does it matter\n    On the mountain peak called \u2018Going-To-The-Sun\u2019?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nTHE MYSTIC UNICORN OF THE MONTANA SUNSET\n\n\n    On the mountain peak, called \u201cGoing-To-The-Sun,\u201d\n    I saw the Unicorn-No-Storm-Can-Tame.\n    The center of the sun was but his eye,\n    His mane was but the sun rays and the flame.\n    There in that Glacier Park, above green pastures,\n    There above Stephen\u2019s camp fire in the rocks,\n    He foamed and pawed and whinnied round the world,\n    His feathered sides and plumes and bristling locks\n    Seemed but the banners of a great announcement\n    That unicorns were spry as heretofore,\n    That not a camp fire of the world was dead,\n    That dragons lived in them, and thousands more\n    Camp-born, were clawing at the clouds of Asia,\n    Were rising with to-morrow\u2019s dawn for men,\n    Camp-fire dragons, with the ancient unicorn\n    Bringing the Rosicrucian days again.\n    Any unicorn can drive away\n    Any thoughts the grown-up race has spoiled.\n    When I heard the Unicorn-of-Sunset ramping\n    New fancies in my veins bubbled and boiled.\n\n    Any unicorn is worth his oats,\n    And so we fed him bacon, and we made\n    An extra cup of tea, which he drank.\n    Then he curled up coltwise, and in slumber sank.\n    Dragons sprang up, next day, where he had stayed.\n    They were in Fujiyama silks arrayed,\n    Or spoke of Everest to Stephen. Then began\n    Discussing the strange peak in Darien\n    That poets climb to see the Pacific well.\n    How Stephen climbed it later, I will let him tell.\n    Following the Unicorn-No-Storm-Can-Tame\n    Alone, in tropic woods, is a great game.\n\n\n\n\nJOHNNY APPLESEED STILL FURTHER WEST\n\n\n    On the mountain peak, called \u201cGoing-To-The-Sun,\u201d\n    I saw old Johnny Appleseed once more.\n    He ate an apple, threw away the core.\n    Then turned and smiled and slackly watched it fall\n    Into a crevice of the mountain wall.\n    In an instant there was an apple tree,\n    The roots split up the rocks beneath our feet,\n    And apples rolled down the green mountainside\n    And fairies popped from them, flying and free!\n\nAnd\nFairies\nCame from them.\n\n\n\n\nTHE APPLE-BARREL OF JOHNNY APPLESEED\n\n\n    On the mountain peak, called \u201cGoing-To-The-Sun,\u201d\n    I saw gray Johnny Appleseed at prayer\n    Just as the sunset made the old earth fair.\n    Then darkness came; in an instant, like great smoke,\n    The sun fell down as though its great hoops broke\n    And dark rich apples, poured from the dim flame\n    Where the sun set, came rolling toward the peak,\n    A storm of fruit, a mighty cider-reek,\n    The perfume of the orchards of the world,\n    From apple-shadows: red and russet domes\n    That turned to clouds of glory and strange homes\n    Above the mountain tops for cloud-born souls:--\n    Reproofs for men who build the world like moles,\n    Models for men, if they would build the world\n    As Johnny Appleseed would have it done--\n    Praying, and reading the books of Swedenborg\n    On the mountain top called \u201cGoing-To-The-Sun.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nTHE COMET OF GOING-TO-THE-SUN\n\n\n    On the mountain peak, called \u201cGoing-To-The-Sun,\u201d\n    A comet stopped to drink from a cool spring\n    And like a spirit-harp began to sing\n    To us, then hurried on to reach the sun.\n    We called him \u201cHomer\u2019s soul,\u201d and \u201cMilton\u2019s wing.\u201d\n    The harp-sound stayed, though he went up and on.\n    It turned to thunder, when he had quite gone--\n    And yet was like a soft voice of the sea,\n    And every whispering root and every blade of grass\n    And every tree\n    In the whole world, and brought thoughts of old songs\n    That blind men sang ten thousand years ago,\n    And all the springtime hearts of every nation know.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BOAT WITH THE KITE STRING AND THE CELESTIAL EYES\n\n\n    On the mountain peak, called \u201cGoing-To-The-Sun,\u201d\n    I sat alone; while Stephen explored higher,\n    I dragged in sticks and logs and kept our fire.\n\n    On soft-winged sails of meditation\n    My boat of spiral shells and flowers,\n    And fluffy clouds and twinkling hours,\n    My thought-boat went with the sun all day\n    Over the glaciers, far away.\n    I sat alone, but the chipmunks knew\n    My boat was high, and plain to view.\n\n    I flew my ship like a kite. The thread\n    Was a cobweb silk, fine and thin,\n    That came from out the palm of my hand.\n    There I saw the ship begin.\n    From the gypsy\u2019s life line thence it came\n\n    A feather of mist that flew to the dawn,\n    And I felt the spool in my wrist unwind,\n    And I saw the feather on heaven\u2019s lawn,\n    Now a glimmering ship like a lark awake.\n    And the kite string sang, but did not break.\n\n    It stretched like the string of a violin\n    Played by invisible tides and waves.\n    It sang of Springfield yet to be.\n    It sang of the dead hours in their graves.\n\n    And of the United States to be,\n    And of all the map stretched out below.\n    And my kite had pansy eyes in its wings,\n    And I saw the states in their bloom and glow\n    Yet a child\u2019s block-map, and nothing more,\n    Flat patterns on a playroom floor.\n\n    Texas the fort, by the river to the south,\n    Michigan a pheasant with a leaf in its mouth,\n    Illinois an ear of corn, in the shock,\n    Maine a moose-horn, gray as a rock.\n    California a whale, in gilded mail,\n    Montana, a ranch of alfalfa and clover,\n\n    Montana with its mountain called \u201cGoing-To-The-Sun,\u201d\n    An outdoor temple for the singer and the rover,\n    Wyoming a range for a summer lark,\n    With sparkling trails, and its Yellowstone Park,\n    Colorado an Indian tent for the world,\n    Where the smokes of care-free camps are curled,\n    Arizona a mission in the desert for all time,\n    Where the nerves find peace, and thoughts find rhyme,\n    New Mexico a clay pueblo full of dreams,\n    Eldorado in its valleys, ghosts by its streams.\n    Utah a throne for a grandeur unknown,\n    For haughty hearts, with ways of their own.\n    Nevada the cabin of Mark Twain in his youth,\n    Where he mined in the ca\u00f1ons, where he dug for the truth.\n    Washington a western soldier\u2019s tent,\n    Idaho a chair for a president,\n    North and South Dakota, one buffalo hide,\n    Oregon a lumber mill on a mountain side,\n    Nebraska, Oklahoma, cowboy pistols pointing west\n    Kansas a wheat field where I, once, was a guest,\n    Iowa a corn pone sizzling hot,\n    Minnesota a farmer\u2019s coffee-pot.\n    Arkansas a steamboat at Mark Twain\u2019s door,\n    Missouri Mark Twain\u2019s raft on the shore.\n    Louisiana a cavalier\u2019s boot, just the thing\n    When we wade toward the mouth of the delta in the spring.\n    Mississippi a cotton scales,\n    Alabama many cotton bales,\n    Georgia a peach-basket red,\n    Florida a wild turkey\u2019s head,\n    North Carolina a crane, flying through a cloud,\n    South Carolina a soldier, with head unbowed,\n    West Virginia, the raccoon, shrewd and slow,\n    Tennessee Bob Taylor\u2019s fiddle and bow,\n    Virginia Thomas Jefferson\u2019s mountain and shroud,\n    Kentucky the log cradle of the proud.\n    Maryland a plow, Delaware a pruning hook,\n    Indiana Riley\u2019s Hoosier book,\n    Wisconsin a caldron, cool it who can,\n    Ohio Johnny Appleseed\u2019s park for man.\n    Vermont a poet\u2019s house, with waterfall and fern,\n    Where Frost writes songs that the world will learn.\n\n    New Jersey the doorstep of the nation,\n    Pennsylvania the front room of the nation,\n    Where once Penn welcomed all creation\n    And let them sleep on the grassy floor\n    And let them eat the wild berries and explore.\n    Rhode Island, Roger Williams\u2019 holy place,\n    Connecticut, an arbor of innocence and grace\n    Filled with flowers, and souls like lace,\n    Especially one little girl six years young\n    Who tells me stories in the fairy tongue.\n\n    New Hampshire the mast of the Mayflower,\n    Massachusetts the prow of the Mayflower,\n    Most famous ark forevermore.\n\n    The whole map a temple, if we patiently read,\n    With the statue of Liberty in majesty to plead\n    For Arcady to come once more,\n    And with New York on guard,\n    New York a sentinel,\n    New York a lion by the door.\n\n    By my camp fire I grew older,\n    There were chipmunks on my shoulder,\n    While I saw the world,\n    With the eyes of my boat,\n    As one land,\n    With Asia and Alaska by the ice bound as one,\n    The Aurora Borealis was a cross bright as the sun.\n    I seemed to live through myriad days.\n    My eyes looked down like searching rays.\n    I took my flight over many races,\n    I saw, in my thought, all human faces.\n    And my spirit had its fill.\n    And the thread in my wrist wound in again\n    The cobweb shortened, strand on strand,\n    And my little ship came back to land\n    And was only a feather in my hand.\n\n\n\n\nSO MUCH THE WORSE FOR BOSTON\n\n\n[Sidenote:\n\n_Some words about singing this song,\nAre written this border along._]\n\n    I read the aspens like a book, and every leaf was signed,\n    And I climbed above the aspen-grove to read what I could find\n    On Mount Clinton, Colorado, I met a mountain-cat.\n    I will call him \u201cAndrew Jackson,\u201d and I mean no harm by that.\n    He was growling, and devouring a terrific mountain-rat.\n    But when the feast was ended, the mountain-cat was kind,\n    And showed a pretty smile, and spoke his mind.\n    \u201cI am dreaming of old Boston,\u201d he said, and wiped his jaws.\n\n    \u201cI have often HEARD of Boston,\u201d and he folded in his paws,\n    \u201cBoston, Massachusetts, a mountain bold and great.\n    I will tell you all about it, if you care to curl and wait.\n\n[Sidenote:\n\n_If I cannot sing in the aspens\u2019 tongue,\nIf I know not what they say,\nThen I have never gone to school,\nAnd have wasted all my day._]\n\n    \u201cIn the Boston of my beauty-sleep, when storm-flowers are in bloom,\n    When storm-lilies and storm-thistles and storm-roses are in bloom,\n    The faithful cats go creeping through the catnip-ferns,\n    _And_ rainbows, _and_ sunshine, _and_ gloom,\n    And pounce upon the Boston Mice, that tremble underneath the flowers,\n    And pounce upon the big-eared rats, and drag them to the tomb.\n    For we are Tom-policemen, vigilant and sure.\n    We keep the Back Bay ditches and potato cellars pure.\n    Apples are not bitten into, cheese is let alone.\n\nTHE BOSTON MOUSE WAITS IN TERROR OF THE MOUNTAIN-CAT, UNDER THE SHADOW\nOF THE STORM-ROSE]\n\n[Sidenote:\n\n_Come, let us whisper of men and beasts\nAnd joke as the aspens do,\nAnd yet be solemn in their way,\nAnd tell our thoughts\nAll summer through,\nIn the morning,\nIn the frost,\nAnd in the midnight dew._]\n\n    Sweet corn is left upon the cob, and the beef left on the bone.\n    Every Sunday morning, the Pilgrims give us codfish balls,\n    Because we keep the poisonous rats from the Boston halls.\u201d\n    And then I contradicted him, in a manner firm and flat.\n    \u201cI have never seen, in the famous Hub, suppression of the rat.\u201d\n    \u201cSo much the worse for Boston,\u201d said the whiskery mountain-cat.\n\n    And the cat continued his great dream, closing one shrewd eye:\n    \u201cThe Tower-of-Babel Cactus blazes above the sky.\n    Fangs and sabers guard the buds and crimson fruits on high.\n    Yet cactus-eating eagles and black hawks hum through the air.\n    When the pigeons weep in Copley Square, look up, those wings are there,\n\nTHE TOWER-OF-BABEL CACTUS BLAZES ABOVE THE SKY]\n\n[Sidenote:\n\n_The mountain-cat seems violent,\nAnd of no good intent.\nYet read his words so gently\nNo bird will leave its tree,\nNo child will hate the simper or the noise\nAnd hurry away from you and me.\nRead like a meditative, catlike willow-tree._]\n\n[Sidenote:\n\n_Some words about singing this song,\nAre scattered this border along._]\n\n    Proud Yankee birds of prey, overshadowing the land,\n    Screaming to younger Yankees of the self-same brand,\n    Whose talk is like the American flag, snapping on the summit-pole,\n    Sky-rocket and star-spangled words, round sunflower words,\n        they use them whole.\n    There are no tailors in command, men seem like trees in honest leaves.\n    Their clothes are but their bark and hide, and sod and binding\n        for their sheaves.\n    Men are as the shocks of corn, as natural as alfalfa fields.\n    And no one yields to purse or badge; only to sweating manhood yields,\n    To natural authority, to wisdom straight from the new sun.\n    Who is the bull-god of the herd? The strongest and the shaggiest one.\n    Or if they preen at all, they preen with Walter Raleigh\u2019s\n        gracious pride:--\n    The forest-ranger! One grand show! With gun and spade slung at his side!\n    Up on the dizzy timber-line, arbiter of life and fate,\n    Where sacred frost shines all the year, and freezing bee\n        and mossflower mate.\n\n[Sidenote:\n\n_Read like the Mariposa with the stately stem,\nWith green jade leaves like ripples and like waves,\nAnd white jade petals,\nSmooth as foam can be--\nThe Mariposa lily, that is leaning upon the young stream\u2019s hem,\nSpeaking grandly to that larger flower\nThat grows down toward the sea, hour after hour\nHunting for the Pacific storms and caves._]\n\n    \u201cBoston is tough country, and the ranger rides with death,\n    Plunges to stop the forest fire against the black smoke\u2019s breath,\n    Buries the cattle killed by eating larkspur lush and blue,\n    Shoots the calf-thieves, lumber-thieves, and gets train-robbers too.\n\n[Sidenote:\n\n_Some words about singing this song,\nAre scattered this border along._]\n\n    Governor and Sheriff obey his ordering hand,\n    Following his ostrich plume across the amber sand.\n    \u201cBut often, for lone days he goes, exploring cliffs afar,\n    And chants his King James\u2019 Bible to tarantula and star.\n    I hear him read Egyptian tales, as he rides by in the dawn.\n    I am sometimes an Egyptian cat.
