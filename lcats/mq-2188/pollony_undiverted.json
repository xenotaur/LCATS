    "body": "Pollony's dream formed around a glare of light, a tang of men's lotion.\nThen she was awake to Brendel poking her.\n\n\"I'm hungry.\"\n\nShe struggled to burrow back into sleep.\n\n\"I'm starving, kid. I can't sleep.\"\n\nShe bleared at the timespot. It was three a.m. \"Go 'way.\"\n\n\"Aw, gimme an omelette.\" Brendel ate a lot lately. His features were\ncoarsening from it; his body was plumpening.\n\nShe argued and protested and whined, and he hit her. But it didn't make\nher feel good any more when he hit her.\n\nKitchen Central was inop for the night. She punched Storage. Dried\ningredients materialized on the cookgrid, a flat metal sheet set into\nthe countertop.\n\nLater, as she took the omelette up, she heard Brendel setting the opera\ntapes. She scowled. But when opera shattered their live she dropped the\nskillet and cried, \"Oh! Do we have to listen to that trash?\" Her voice\nwas more weary than shrill. The opera routine was getting old.\n\n\"What you calling trash?\" He twitched his plump shoulders.\n\n\"It makes me sick!\"\n\nHe spat profanity.\n\nIt wasn't a good fight. He knew something was wrong and he hit her too\nhard. She slugged back, hurt her hand, cursed, ran and locked herself\ninto the sleep.\n\nShe was asleep when he came pounding. She woke and pointed the lock\nopen. She glared.\n\nHe said nothing. He ordered his smaller collections--his miniature\nhorses, his ballpoint pens and his old-time cereal box missiles--on\nto his storeshelf before mounting his sleepshelf and pointing out the\nlight.\n\nShe could hear him not sleeping.\n\nFinally he muttered, \"Too damn much cheese but it was okay.\"\n\nShe said nothing. She didn't almost cry as she might have a month\nbefore.\n\n\n\nBrendel had appeared on their grid a year before, a dark, pugnacious\nyoung man, jittering and nervous. \"Clare Webster around?\"\n\n\"Mother isn't here.\" Her mother collected men. She met them at drinking\nclubs or collector meets. She gave them her grid card and took theirs,\nmaking them promise to come see her. If a man came, she tacked his card\non her bulletin board. If he came twice or three times, she marked his\ncard with colored pencil.\n\nBrendel twitched his shoulders. \"I got the evening. Wanta have dinner,\nkid?\"\n\nShe was seventeen and tired of collecting china roosters and peach-can\nlabels. She was tired of seeing the same stupid people every day.\nSomewhere there was someone handsome and perfect, and she had to find\nhim and become perfect too. She couldn't waste all her life being\nstupid like her mother.\n\nIt took her two hours to see that Brendel was the perfect person. He\nwas handsome, aggressive, easy to be with. He quarreled all the time\nand he even had a full-time job.\n\nShe married him. She dropped her little-girl collections and\ndiversions. She was no longer a formless adolescent. She was very\nsolid, very adult.\n\nBut the solidness had gone. She had found that Brendel's aggressiveness\nmasked fear; his quarrelsomeness masked insecurity. Worst, he had no\nimagination. He plodded.\n\nIt had begun two weeks before. Brendel had come home from work tight\nand tense. He tried eating, he tried opera and quarreling, he tried\nexercises. Finally he said, \"I'm gonna go see Latsker Smith. Wanta\ncome?\"\n\n\"Who the hell's Latsker Smith?\" Already she was sick of the opera\nroutine--and a little sick of Brendel.\n\n\"Drives a car. From Boston. Fella at the plant told me he's in\ncentercity.\"\n\n\n\nMinutes later they gridded out of the suburban maze. They materialized\non a corner grid in centercity. There was no one on the dusty street.\nThere was no car near the gaunt brick building where Latsker Smith was\nstaying. They plopped on the doorstep.\n\nBrendel fidgeted and talked. Latsker Smith was the son of a rich\nindustrialist. His father wouldn't support him unless he worked, and\nLatsker wouldn't work. So he had to live on government non-employment\nallowance. His pre-grid automobile and airplane were his only\ndiversions. Since he couldn't leave Boston by automobile, Boston\nbeing walled up like any city by the streetless suburbs, he saved his\nallowance until he could commercial-grid his car to another city.\nThere he raced and squealed and spun through the deserted streets\nof centercity until he had saved enough to commercial-grid the car\nelsewhere.\n\nA throbbing split the air. A red splinter of car hurtled around the\ncorner and squealed to the curb. A tall, lank man unfolded, ignoring\nthem.\n\nBrendel sprang to overwhelm him. He pulled him to the steps to make\nintroductions. But Latsker Smith peered absently at Pollony and she was\nembarrassed that Brendel acted like an eager child confronting some\nheroic figure from a dream.\n\n\"Latsker's pop got money.\" Brendel launched into his story again.\n\nWhen the story fizzled she said, \"Why couldn't you get a job?\"\n\nSmith held his head tilted. \"Don't want a job.\"\n\n\"If you had a job you wouldn't have to stay one place so long.\"\n\n\"No use being anyplace if I have to leave my car.\"\n\nShe pursed her lips. Inside the car she could see seats, straps, a\nwheel. It was incomprehensible that he strapped himself in and hurtled\nthrough the streets. \"It's a stupid thing to do,\" she said. \"You'll get\nkilled.\"\n\n\"No,\" he said.\n\n\"If you hit something you will. I've heard those atrocity stories.\nThere were more people killed in automobiles from--\"\n\n\"Nothing to hit,\" he said.\n\nShe flung out her arms. \"Buildings! Poles!\" His lack of response\noffended her.\n\n\"No need to hit them.\"\n\n\"I've seen the films!\" She had seen the crumpled metal, the severed\nlimbs, the spreading blood.\n\n\"Driver error. No drivers left. Too expensive on government allowance.\"\n\n\"No one stupid enough left, you mean!\" But it was stupid to glare when\nhe wouldn't frown. \"Okay, what's it feel like?\" she demanded.\n\nHe lifted his shoulders and dropped them.\n\n\"It must feel some way.\" She peered down into the machine, trying to\nimagine herself hurtling in it. \"You fly an airplane too,\" she accused.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"I bet it feels just like gridding. And it takes longer.\"\n\n\"Gridding.\" He snorted, mildly. \"There's no sensation at all to\ngridding.\"\n\n\"Then how does it feel to fly?\" she prodded.\n\nBrendel moved restlessly, bored. \"Let's get going.\"\n\n\"We just got here, stupid,\" she protested.\n\nHe was already pulling her to the corner grid. \"I'm getting hungry.\"\n\nShe tried to jerk her arm free but couldn't. \"How long will you be\nhere?\" she called back, swatting Brendel's arm.\n\nHe lifted his shoulders and dropped them.\n\n\"If I come--\" But Brendel had given their number. They were outside\ntheir own door, and she hadn't felt a thing. Today she resented not\nfeeling a thing.\n\n\"These weird-o's, they talk too much. I'm hungry.\"\n\nShe resented punching his food and didn't even want to quarrel.\n\n\n\nShe drowsed back into sleep, remembering. Everything was empty. She\nate, she slept, she quarreled, she gridded around seeing friends.\nWhat else was there? She couldn't get a job; there weren't that many\njobs. And with the government allowance for not working, who needed\na job? Who needed anything? A time of plenty, her school machine had\ncalled it. You just gridded around collecting and arguing to make it\ninteresting. There were so many people moving so fast that you had to\nquarrel and push or you'd get stepped on.\n\nIt was all stupid. Brendel didn't help a bit. He was stupid too.\n\nShe tried to imagine Latsker Smith echoing through the empty streets in\nhis scarlet splinter of car. Latsker Smith couldn't be stupid.\n\nShe slept three hours before the gridbell rang.\n\nElka, her cousin, stood on the grid, loose-haired, big-toothed. She\nswung a hatbox. \"I didn't get you up?\"\n\n\"No,\" Pollony said hopelessly.\n\n\"I'm gridding to NYC hatting and--\"\n\n\"It's not even seven.\"\n\n\"Poll, I'm contritest but you weren't sleeping and--\"\n\n\"I don't need hats.\"\n\n\"You haven't seen the darling I got in Paris. I gridded over with\nSella Kyle and, honestly, there was a shop that--\"\n\nShe convinced Elka that she was not going hatting. Elka took her toll\nin coffee and gridded after her Paris hat. Pollony barely admired it\nand Elka left.\n\nBefore she could dial Brendel's breakfast her mother was on the grid,\nfluffy, fleecy, thrusting a wad of bills at her.\n\n\"Just on my way to Mexico, toodle. Punch me some coffee?\" Breathless\nmoments later she was gone.\n\n\"What took so long?\" Brendel demanded when she woke him.\n\n\"Momma stopped.\" She hated him like this, his face creased and puffy\nfrom sleep. She had never thought he would get fat.\n\nHe gulped his breakfast and left. Sometimes she hated him for just\nbeing.\n\nThe gridbell rang. It was a salesman. He insinuated she didn't have\nthe money to buy his product. She said his merchandise stank. He left\ngrinning but she didn't feel better.\n\nThe bell rang. A young man muttered, \"Mis-grid,\" and disappeared.\n\nShe had gotten to the dress when she heard the door open. She eyed the\nhall reflector and saw Ferren, her mother's brother, slip into the\ncook. She dressed hastily. Ferren would order breakfast and keep the\nsilver to turn in from his own grid for the deposit.\n\n\n\nHe was plumped up to the counter, a wooly haired man, attacking a stack\nof eggcakes.\n\n\"Let me have them.\"\n\nHe purred, taking spoon and knife from a pocket. \"The government\nallowance is hardly sufficient for a man of my tastes. Shielded by your\nfather's fortune as you are--\"\n\n\"You could get a job.\" She punched coffee. She wished he would go away.\nHe was always watching, smiling, spinning together soft words.\n\n\"And add to the work shortage?\" He wagged his wooly head.\n\n\"Then don't complain. There should be a syrup pitcher too.\"\n\nHe produced it, purring.\n\nThe gridbell rang. Two pig-faced men in black Gridco uniforms blocked\nthe doorway. \"You got Ferren Carmichaels inside, lady.\"\n\n\"No.\" You always lied to Gridco collectors.\n\n\"We traced him here from Dallas.\"\n\n\"Well, he isn't here now.\"\n\n\"How come we heard him talking?\"\n\n\"He isn't here.\" Gridco could not remove a grid even though the\nsubscriber refused to pay his quarterly bill. The grid was held by law\nto be essential to human existence in the twisting, walled alleys\nof suburbia. Gridco could only send collectors to follow until their\nquarry fell or was pushed into their hands. And a man who had once\nfallen into Gridco hands paid eagerly forever after.\n\n\"We can pull another trace.\"\n\n\"Do that!\" She slammed the door.\n\nShe had time for a quick swallow of coffee before the bell rang.\n\n\"He didn't go no farther.\"\n\nShe sighed. \"Well, he won't come out. I can't make him.\"\n\n\"He'll come sometime.\" They leaned back against nothing, waiting.\n\n\"You're blocking my grid.\"\n\nDutifully they stepped into the narrow corridor.\n\nShe slammed the door. \"They are going to stand there until you go out.\"\n\nFerren drained his coffee cup. \"I'll settle here, then.\"\n\n\"If you--\"\n\nHe tutted. \"Thank you for the lunch invitation.\"\n\n\"I--\" She bit her tongue. She would not get mad.\n\nHe wagged his head. \"I'll peruse Brendel's books. Fine collection for a\nyoung man, books.\"\n\nGritting her teeth, she hurtled back to the dress.\n\n\n\nThe collectors rang every five minutes after that. They kept ringing\nuntil she went and told them Ferren would not come out.\n\nIt wasn't the way she had imagined it would be when she was married.\nWhat with punching Brendel's meals, sending out his clothes, going\ncollecting with him and quarreling, she hardly had a minute. And the\nsame stupid people, Elka, Ferren, her mother and father, were always\nthere.\n\nThe bell rang. Her father scowled, seeing Ferren on Brendel's best\nsitshelf. \"Where?\" he said grimly.\n\n\"Mexico,\" she said.\n\n\"Pottery,\" he said, going.\n\nThe bell rang. A heavy-jawed youth said, \"Miss Webster gave me--\"\n\n\"My mother has gone to Mexico.\" She slammed the door.\n\nMinutes later Sella Kyle gridded in, crisp, prim, blonde. \"I haven't\nseen you in such a time, Poll. Coffee?\"\n\nShe entertained Sella and wished she would go and knew Ferren knew she\nwanted Sella to go and found it amusing.\n\nEvery five minutes the collectors rang.\n\nShe had just talked Sella out the door when Lukia Collins gridded in.\nLukia had never been Pollony's close friend in school. But now Lukia\nwas always near, pushing, prodding at Pollony, smiling too brightly at\nBrendel.\n\n\"You two _are_ coming to lunch with me.\"\n\n\"I've already asked Ferren to lunch.\"\n\n\"Silly, he can punch his own.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Pollony said.\n\n\"I take the silver.\" Ferren smiled comfortably.\n\nLukia flipped her hand at him. \"Atrocious man. Now, Pollony--\"\n\nIt ended with Lukia inviting herself to come back to lunch. She had\nhardly vacated the grid when Elka appeared.\n\nShe unwrapped her purchases, smirking at Ferren. \"You'd be surprised\nthe number of hats a girl needs.\" She stayed half an hour.\n\nAnother young man came for her mother. Two salesman, a traveling\ncircular and a friend came. Then Brendel was on the grid.\n\n\"Who these lugs for?\"\n\n\"Uncle Ferren,\" she said shortly.\n\nHe lifted a lip at them, then bounced inside. \"Forget your bill, Ferry?\nHey, kid, punch drinks.\"\n\n\"I refused to honor it,\" Ferren said.\n\nBrendel was already fishing in his pocket. \"Drinks, kid.\"\n\nShe went to punch. She hated his trying to give money to everyone who\ncame along.\n\n\"No, no, it is a matter of principle,\" Ferren insisted. But the money\nchanged hands. \"And there were certain other obligations.\"\n\n\"How much you need?\" Brendel fished into his pocket again, grinning.\n\n\n\nThe bell rang. It was Lukia. \"All these ravenous people waiting on me?\"\nShe had changed into a fire-red daysuit. \"Dobble, you should have fed\nthe beasts.\" She snapped her fingers. \"Up, beasts. I'll help you punch,\ndob.\"\n\nGlowering, Pollony moved toward the cook. Brendel followed, chattering\nand arguing with Lukia.\n\nPollony was beginning to think again of a swiftly accelerating car, of\nher body encased beside that of Latsker Smith and hurtled through dusty\nstreets.\n\nBrendel said, \"How many for opera?\"\n\nShe whirled and glared.\n\n\"Pollony's a bug on opera. Tell them how you like opera, kid.\"\n\nShe glared. The last time Lukia and Ferren had been here he had done\nthis, and the time before. Didn't he have any imagination?\n\n\"Tell them, kid.\"\n\nFool! Didn't he know they were laughing at him?\n\nShe wanted to tear loose from her whole life. It was trivial. It was\neveryday. It was gossip and collections and stupid people. She had\nto tear loose or she would go on and on, all her life, being nothing\nbut--herself.\n\nShe was too good for that.\n\nShe was too good for Brendel. He had tricked her and turned into a\nfattening fool. It was stupid to stay with him.\n\n\"Aw, come on, kid.\"\n\nShe drew herself up very straight and imagined she must look imposing.\n\"I'll ask you all to leave,\" she said calmly.\n\nGone were the smiles.\n\n\"I'm closing my grid to public access. I'll ask you to leave\nimmediately.\" The words came out stiffly and precisely. She imagined\nshe must already be more than just herself.\n\n\"What the hell!\"\n\n\"Brendel, you may come back when I am gone. I shall not return.\" She\nsmiled, remotely. \"I'm tired of punching your food and going collecting\nand quarreling and being hit around.\"\n\n\"I never hit you hard!\" he said indignantly.\n\nLukia stared at him. \"Dobble!\"\n\n\"Well, she made me do it. What'm I supposed to do?\"\n\n\"Dobble, you're perfectly justified!\" But Lukia's eyes remained on\nBrendel, bright and greedy.\n\nPollony glared. She would not stay and fight Lukia for Brendel.\n\n\n\nShe flung the door open. The two collectors snapped alert. \"I want to\nbe alone,\" she intoned.\n\nBrendel eyed her balefully. But he had already noticed Lukia's\ninterest. \"Where we gonna go?\"\n\n\"We can go to my live,\" Lukia said. \"I think Dobble deserves her little\nwhim.\"\n\nBrendel could not believe she was not going to fight. \"You, kid! You're\nacting like a kid.\"\n\nFerren took Brendel's arm. \"Don't stoop to conventional pettiness,\nBrendel.\"\n\nBrendel flushed. \"I'm coming back. You're not rooking me out of my\ncollections.\" He turned abruptly and stepped on the grid. Giving a\nthree-passenger order, he disappeared. Lukia followed. Ferren stepped\non, tossed bills to the collectors, and disappeared.\n\nPollony closed the door. She leaned against it, breathing the silence.\n\nThen she hurried through the live, setting it in order. She\nstraightened the books Ferren had been examining and found two missing.\n\nEven as Lukia was punching dinner and saying all the things designed\nto make Brendel want Pollony back only briefly, as a point of pride,\nPollony was whisking into a brisk trousersuit and wondering how much\nhad piled up in the account where she kept her parents' gifts.\n\nEven as Brendel was feeling Lukia's face with his eyes, letting her\nexcitement speak to his own, Pollony was at the bank having her balance\nmarked into her deposit clip.\n\nEven as Ferren was smiling and wondering how much the two books would\nbring, Pollony was rapping at the door of the apartment house in\ncentercity and being told that, yes, Mr. Smith still lived there.\n\nPresently Latsker Smith roared around the corner and braked his car. He\nunfolded from the cockpit. He nodded.\n\n\"Have you got money to go to Boston yet?\" She held herself very\nstraight.\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"I have money,\" she said.\n\nThe pale eyes clung to her.\n\n\"My parents give me an allowance, and I could get jobs wherever we\nwere. I just want to ride with you. I wouldn't even talk unless you\nwanted me to.\" She had to be with him. She had to sit and stand beside\nhim, as relaxed and withdrawn as he was. She had to freeze people with\nher words and with her unrespondingness. She had to make an end of\nstupidness.\n\nHe took a deposit clip from a pocket. He pointed to a figure. \"Match\nthat?\"\n\nShe withdrew her own clip and showed him a figure that exceeded his.\n\n\"How much allowance?\"\n\nShe told him.\n\nHe nodded to the car. \"Wait there. Take me five minutes to pack.\"\n\n\n\nDreadingly, joyously, she folded into the car. She watched as he lanked\nup the steps. She settled back, holding her shoulders rigid and her\nhead straight. She would sit and stand by him. She would chill people\nwith her reserve. She would be very solid and very adult.\n\nBut minutes later she looked at her wrist and saw that he had been more\nthan five minutes. She wished he wouldn't take so long.\n\nWhen he came down the steps two at a time, she tried not to remember\nthat she hated people who came down steps two at a time. She didn't\nlike the way his hair flopped against his forehead either. And she\nalmost got out of the car when she saw his trousersuit was much too\nshort. It made him look off-balance.\n\nHe got into the car. \"Don't touch this.\" He pointed to the starter\nbutton. He scowled. \"Or this or this or this.\" He pointed to the\npedals, to the gearshift lever. He reached out and heaved his suitcase\ninto her lap. He said brusquely, \"Don't let it bump the door panel.\" A\ncorner dug into her stomach.\n\nAnd then he turned his head and ignored her. Completely. And she forgot\nthe steps, the hair and the trousersuit and knew she would not get out\nof the car so long as he was in it.",
