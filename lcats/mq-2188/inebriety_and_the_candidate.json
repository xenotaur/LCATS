Say, ye, its fiery vot'ries true,\nThe jovial curate, and the shrill-tongued shrew;\nYe, in the floods of limpid poison nurst,\nWhere bowl the second charms like bowl the first;\nSay how, and why, the sparkling ill is shed,\nThe heart which hardens, and which rules the head.\n   When winter stern his gloomy front uprears,\nA sable void the barren earth appears;\nThe meads no more their former verdure boast,\nFast bound their streams, and all their beauty lost;\nThe herds, the flocks, in icy garments mourn,\nAnd wildly murmur for the spring's return;\nFrom snow-topp'd hills the whirlwinds keenly blow,\nHowl through the woods, and pierce the vales below;\nThrough the sharp air a flaky torrent flies,\nMocks the slow sight, and hides the gloomy skies;\nThe fleecy clouds their chilly bosoms bare,\nAnd shed their substance on the floating air;\nThe floating air their downy substance glides\nThrough springing waters, and prevents their tides;\nSeizes the rolling waves, and, as a god,\nCharms their swift race, and stops the refluent flood;\nThe opening valves, which fill the venal road,\nThen scarcely urge along the sanguine flood;\nThe labouring pulse a slower motion rules,\nThe tendons stiffen, and the spirit cools;\nEach asks the aid of Nature's sister, Art,\nTo cheer the senses, and to warm the heart.\n   The gentle fair on nervous tea relies,\nWhilst gay good-nature sparkles in her eyes;\nAn inoffensive scandal fluttering round,\nToo rough to tickle, and too light to wound;\nChampagne the courtier drinks, the spleen to chase,\nThe colonel burgundy, and port his grace;\nTurtle and 'rrac the city rulers charm,\nAle and content the labouring peasants warm:\nO'er the dull embers, happy Colin sits,\nColin, the prince of joke, and rural wits;\nWhilst the wind whistles through the hollow panes,\nHe drinks, nor of the rude assault complains;\nAnd tells the tale, from sire to son retold,\nOf spirits vanishing near hidden gold;\nOf moon-clad imps that tremble by the dew,\nWho skim the air, or glide o'er waters blue:\nThe throng invisible that, doubtless, float\nBy mouldering tombs, and o'er the stagnant meat:\nFays dimly glancing on the russet plain,\nAnd all the dreadful nothing of the green.\nPeace be to such, the happiest and the best,\nWho with the forms of fancy urge their jest;\nWho wage no war with an avenger's rod,\nNor in the pride of reason curse their God.\n   When in the vaulted arch Lucina gleams,\nAnd gaily dances o'er the azure streams;\nOn silent ether when a trembling sound\nReverberates, and wildly floats around,\nBreaking through trackless space upon the ear,\nConclude the Bacchanalian rustic near:\nO'er hills and vales the jovial savage reels,\nFire in his head and frenzy at his heels;\nFrom paths direct the bending hero swerves,\nAnd shapes his way in ill-proportioned curves.\nNow safe arrived, his sleeping rib he calls,\nAnd madly thunders on the muddy walls;\nThe well-known sounds an equal fury move,\nFor rage meets rage, as love enkindles love:\nIn vain the waken'd infant's accents shrill,\nThe humble regions of the cottage fill;\nIn vain the cricket chirps the mansion through,\n'Tis war, and blood, and battle must ensue.\nAs when, on humble stage, him Satan hight\nDefies the brazen hero to the fight:\nFrom twanging strokes what dire misfortunes rise,\nWhat fate to maple arms and glassen eyes!\nHere lies a leg of elm, and there a stroke\nFrom ashen neck has whirl'd a head of oak.\nSo drops from either power, with vengeance big,\nA remnant night-cap and an old cut wig;\nTitles unmusical retorted round,\nOn either ear with leaden vengeance sound;\nTill equal valour, equal wounds create,\nAnd drowsy peace concludes the fell debate;\nSleep in her woollen mantle wraps the pair,\nAnd sheds her poppies on the ambient air;\nIntoxication flies, as fury fled,\nOn rooky pinions quits the aching head;\nReturning reason cools the fiery blood,\nAnd drives from memory's seat the rosy god.\nYet still he holds o'er some his maddening rule.\nStill sways his sceptre, and still knows his fool;\nWitness the livid lip, and fiery front,\nWith many a smarting trophy placed upon't;\nThe hollow eye, which plays in misty springs,\nAnd the hoarse voice, which rough and broken rings;\nThese are his triumphs, and o'er these he reigns,\nThe blinking deity of reeling brains.\n   See Inebriety! her wand she waves,\nAnd lo! her pale, and lo! her purple slaves!\nSots in embroidery, and sots in crape,\nOf every order, station, rank, and shape:\nThe king, who nods upon his rattle throne;\nThe staggering peer, to midnight revel prone;\nThe slow-tongued bishop, and the deacon sly,\nThe humble pensioner, and gownsman dry;\nThe proud, the mean, the selfish, and the great,\nSwell the dull throng, and stagger into state.\n   Lo! proud Flaminius at the splendid board,\nThe easy chaplain of an atheist lord,\nQuaffs the bright juice, with all the gust of sense,\nAnd clouds his brain in torpid elegance;\nIn china vases, see! the sparkling ill,\nFrom gay decanters view the rosy rill;\nThe neat-carved pipes in silver settle laid,\nThe screw by mathematic cunning made:\nOh, happy priest! whose God, like Egypt's, lies\nAt once the deity and sacrifice.\nBut is Flaminius then the man alone\nTo whom the joys of swimming brains are known?\nLo! the poor toper whose untutor'd sense,\nSees bliss in ale, and can with wine dispense;\nWhose head proud fancy never taught to steer\nBeyond the muddy ecstasies of beer;\nBut simple nature can her longing quench,\nBehind the settle's curve, or humbler bench:\nSome kitchen fire diffusing warmth around,\nThe semi-globe by hieroglyphics crown'd;\nWhere canvas purse displays the brass enroll'd,\nNor waiters rave, nor landlords thirst for gold;\nAle and content his fancy's bounds confine.\nHe asks no limpid punch, no rosy wine;\nBut sees, admitted to an equal share,\nEach faithful swain the heady potion bear:\nGo, wiser thou! and in thy scale of taste,\nWeigh gout and gravel against ale and rest;\nCall vulgar palates what thou judgest so;\nSay beer is heavy, windy, cold, and slow;\nLaugh at poor sots with insolent pretence,\nYet cry, when tortured, where is Providence?\n   In various forms the madd'ning spirit moves,\nThis drinks and fights, another drinks and loves.\nA bastard zeal, of different kinds it shows,\nAnd now with rage, and now religion glows:\nThe frantic soul bright reason's path defies,\nNow creeps on earth, now triumphs in the skies;\nSwims in the seas of error, and explores,\nThrough midnight mists, the fluctuating shores;\nFrom wave to wave in rocky channel glides,\nAnd sinks in woe, or on presumption slides;\nIn pride exalted, or by shame deprest,\nAn angel-devil, or a human-beast.\n   Some rage in all the strength of folly mad;\nSome love stupidity, in silence clad,\nAre never quarrelsome, are never gay,\nBut sleep, and groan, and drink the night away;\nOld Torpio nods, and as the laugh goes round,\nGrunts through the nasal duct, and joins the sound.\nThen sleeps again, and, as the liquors pass,\nWakes at the friendly jog, and takes his glass:\nAlike to him who stands, or reels, or moves,\nThe elbow chair, good wine, and sleep he loves,\nNor cares of state disturb his easy head,\nBy grosser fumes and calmer follies fed;\nNor thoughts of when, or where, or how to come,\nThe canvass general, or the general doom;\nExtremes ne'er reach'd one passion of his soul,\nA villain tame, and an unmettled fool;\nTo half his vices he has but pretence,\nFor they usurp the place of common sense;\nTo half his little merits has no claim,\nFor very indolence has raised his name;\nHappy in this, that, under Satan's sway,\nHis passions tremble, but will not obey.\n   The vicar at the table's front presides,\nWhose presence a monastic life derides;\nThe reverend wig, in sideway order placed,\nThe reverend band, by rubric stains disgraced,\nThe leering eye, in wayward circles roll'd,\nMark him the pastor of a joyial fold,\nWhose various texts excite a loud applause,\nFavouring the bottle, and the good old cause.\nSee! the dull smile which fearfully appears,\nWhen gross indecency her front uprears,\nThe joy conceal'd, the fiercer burns within,\nAs masks afford the keenest gust to sin;\nImagination helps the reverend sire,\nAnd spreads the sails of sub-divine desire;\nBut when the gay immoral joke goes round,\nWhen shame and all her blushing train are drown'd,\nRather than hear his God blasphemed, he takes\nThe last loved glass, and then the board forsakes.\nNot that religion prompts the sober thought,\nBut slavish custom has the practice taught;\nBesides, this zealous son of warm devotion\nHas a true Levite bias for promotion.\nVicars must with discretion go astray,\nWhilst bishops may be damn'd the nearest way;\nSo puny robbers individuals kill,\nWhen hector-heroes murder as they will.\n   Good honest Curio elbows the divine,\nAnd strives a social sinner how to shine;\nThe dull quaint tale is his, the lengthen'd tale,\nThat Wilton farmers give you with their ale,\nHow midnight ghosts o'er vaults terrific pass,\nDance o'er the grave, and slide along the grass;\nOr how pale Cicely within the wood\nCall'd Satan forth, and bargain'd with her blood.\nThese, honest Curio, are thine, and these\nAre the dull treasures of a brain at peace;\nNo wit intoxicates thy gentle skull,\nOf heavy, native, unwrought folly full:\nBowl upon bowl in vain exert their force,\nThe breathing spirit takes a downward course,\nOr mainly soaring upwards to the head,\nMeets an impenetrable fence of lead.\n   Hast thou, oh reader! searched o'er gentle Gay,\nWhere various animals their powers display?\nIn one strange group a chattering race are hurl'd,\nLed by the monkey who had seen the world.\nLike him Fabricio steals from guardian's side,\nSwims not in pleasure's stream, but sips the tide:\nHe hates the bottle, yet but thinks it right\nTo boast next day the honours of the night;\nNone like your coward can describe a fight.\nSee him as down the sparkling potion goes,\nLabour to grin away the horrid dose;\nIn joy-feigned gaze his misty eyeballs float,\nTh' uncivil spirit gurgling at his throat;\nSo looks dim Titan through a wintry scene,\nAnd faintly cheers the woe-foreboding swain.\n   Timon, long practised in the school of art,\nHas lost each finer feeling of the heart;\nTriumphs o'er shame, and, with delusive wiles,\nLaughs at the idiot he himself beguiles:\nSo matrons, past the awe of censure's tongue,\nDeride the blushes of the fair and young.\nFew with more fire on every subject spoke,\nBut chief he loved the gay immoral joke;\nThe words most sacred, stole from holy writ,\nHe gave a newer form, and called them wit.\nVice never had a more sincere ally,\nSo bold no sinner, yet no saint so sly;\nLearn'd, but not wise, and without virtue brave,\nA gay, deluding, philosophic knave.\nWhen Bacchus' joys his airy fancy fire,\nThey stir a new, but still a false desire;\nAnd to the comfort of each untaught fool,\nHorace in English vindicates the bowl.\n\"The man,\" says Timon, \"who is drunk is blest,\nNo fears disturb, no cares destroy his rest;\nIn thoughtless joy he reels away his life,\nNor dreads that worst of ills, a noisy wife.\"\n\"Oh! place me, Jove, where none but women come,\nAnd thunders worse than thine afflict the room,\nWhere one eternal nothing flutters round,\nAnd senseless titt'ring sense of mirth confound;\nOr lead me bound to garret, Babel-high,\nWhere frantic poet rolls his crazy eye,\nTiring the ear with oft-repeated chimes,\nAnd smiling at the never-ending rhymes:\nE'en here, or there, I'll be as blest as Jove,\nGive me tobacco, and the wine I love.\"\nApplause from hands the dying accents break,\nOf stagg'ring sots who vainly try to speak;\nFrom Milo, him who hangs upon each word,\nAnd in loud praises splits the tortured board,\nCollects each sentence, ere it's better known,\nAnd makes the mutilated joke his own.\nAt weekly club to flourish, where he rules,\nThe glorious president of grosser fools.\n   But cease, my Muse! of those or these enough,\nThe fools who listen, and the knaves who scoff;\nThe jest profane, that mocks th' offended God,\nDefies his power, and sets at nought his rod;\nThe empty laugh, discretion's vainest foe,\nFrom fool to fool re-echoed to and fro;\nThe sly indecency, that slowly springs\nFrom barren wit, and halts on trembling wings:\nEnough of these, and all the charms of wine,\nBe sober joys and social evenings mine;\nWhere peace and reason, unsoil'd mirth, improve\nThe powers of friendship and the joys of love;\nWhere thought meets thought ere words its form array,\nAnd all is sacred, elegant, and gay:\nSuch pleasure leaves no sorrow on the mind,\nToo great to fall, to sicken too refined;\nToo soft for noise, and too sublime for art,\nThe social solace of the feeling heart,\nFor sloth too rapid, and for wit too high,\n'Tis virtue's pleasure, and can never die!\n\n\n\n\"THE CANDIDATE\" {2}\nA POETICAL EPISTLE TO THE AUTHORS OF THE MONTHLY REVIEW.\n\n\n\nAN INTRODUCTORY ADDRESS OF THE AUTHOR TO HIS POEMS.\n\nMulta quidem nobis facimus mala saepe poetae,\n(Ut vineta egomet caedam mea) cum tibi librum\nSollicito damus, aut fesso, &c.\n                            HORACE, Epistle 1.\n\n\nYe idler things, that soothed my hours of care,\nWhere would ye wander, triflers, tell me where?\nAs maids neglected, do ye fondly dote,\nOn the tair type, or the embroider'd coat;\nDetest my modest shelf, and long to fly\nWhere princely Popes and mighty Miltons lie?\nTaught but to sing, and that in simple style,\nOf Lycia's lip, and Musidora's smile; -\nGo then! and taste a yet unfelt distress,\nThe fear that guards the captivating press;\nWhose maddening region should ye once explore,\nNo refuge yields my tongueless mansion more.\nBut thus ye'll grieve, Ambition's plumage stript,\n\"Ah, would to Heaven, we'd died in manuscript!\"\nYour unsoil'd page each yawning wit shall flee,\n- For few will read, and none admire like me. -\nIts place, where spiders silent bards enrobe,\nSqueezed betwixt Cibber's Odes and Blackmore's Job;\nWhere froth and mud, that varnish and deform,\nFeed the lean critic and the fattening worm;\nThen sent disgraced--the unpaid printer's bane -\nTo mad Moorfields, or sober Chancery Lane,\nOn dirty stalls I see your hopes expire,\nVex'd by the grin of your unheeded sire,\nWho half reluctant has his care resign'd,\nLike a teased parent, and is rashly kind.\n   Yet rush not all, but let some scout go forth,\nView the strange land, and tell us of its worth;\nAnd should he there barbarian usage meet,\nThe patriot scrap shall warn us to retreat.\n   And thou, the first of thy eccentric race,\nA forward imp, go, search the dangerous place,\nWhere Fame's eternal blossoms tempt each bard,\nThough dragon-wits there keep eternal guard;\nHope not unhurt the golden spoil to seize,\nThe Muses yield, as the Hesperides;\nWho bribes the guardian, all his labour's done,\nFor every maid is willing to be won.\n   Before the lords of verse a suppliant stand,\nAnd beg our passage through the fairy land:\nBeg more--to search for sweets each blooming field,\nAnd crop the blossoms woods and valleys yield,\nTo snatch the tints that beam on Fancy's bow;\nAnd feel the fires on Genius' wings that glow;\nPraise without meanness, without flattery stoop,\nSoothe without fear, and without trembling, hope.\n\n\nTO THE READER.\n\n\nThe following Poem being itself of an introductory nature, its\nauthor supposes it can require but little preface.\n\nIt is published with a view of obtaining the opinion of the candid\nand judicious reader on the merits of the writer as a poet; very\nfew, he apprehends, being in such cases sufficiently impartial to\ndecide for themselves.\n\nIt is addressed to the Authors of the Monthy Review, as to critics\nof acknowledged merit; an acquaintance  with whose labours has\nafforded the writer of this Epistle a reason for directing it to\nthem in particular, and, he presumes, will yield to others a just\nand sufficient plea for the preference.\n\nFamiliar with disappointment, he shall not be much surprised to find\nhe has mistaken his talent.\n\nHowever, if not egregiously the dupe of his vanity, he promises to\nhis readers some entertainment, and is assured that however little\nin the ensuing Poem is worthy of applause, there is yet less that\nmerits contempt.\n\n\nTO THE AUTHORS OF THE MONTHLY REVIEW.\n\n\nThe pious pilot, whom the gods provide,\nThrough the rough seas the shatter'd bark to guide,\nTrusts not alone his knowledge of the deep,\nIts rocks that threaten, and its sands that sleep;\nBut whilst with nicest skill he steers his way,\nThe guardian Tritons hear their favourite pray.\nHence borne his vows to Neptune's coral dome,\nThe god relents, and shuts each gulfy tomb.\n   Thus as on fatal floods to fame I steer,\nI dread the storm that ever rattles here,\nNor think enough, that long my yielding soul\nHas felt the Muse's soft but strong control,\nNor think enough, that manly strength and ease,\nSuch as have pleased a friend, will strangers please;\nBut, suppliant, to the critic's throne I bow,\nHere burn my incense, and here pay my vow;\nThat censure hush'd, may every blast give o'er,\nAnd the lash'd coxcomb hiss contempt no more.\nAnd ye, whom authors dread or dare in vain,\nAffecting modest hopes, or poor disdain,\nReceive a bard, who neither mad nor mean,\nDespises each extreme, and sails between;\nWho fears; but has, amid his fears confess'd,\nThe conscious virtue of a Muse oppress'd;\nA muse in changing times and stations nursed,\nBy nature honour'd, and by fortune cursed.\n   No servile strain of abject hope she brings,\nNor soars presumptuous, with unwearied wings,\nBut, pruned for flight--the future all her care -\nWould know her strength, and, if not strong, forbear.\n   The supple slave to regal pomp bows down,\nProstrate to power, and cringing to a crown;\nThe bolder villain spurns a decent awe,\nTramples on rule, and breaks through every law;\nBut he whose soul on honest truth relies,\nNor meanly flatters power, nor madly flies.\nThus timid authors bear an abject mind,\nAnd plead for mercy they but seldom find.\nSome, as the desperate, to the halter run,\nBoldly deride the fate they cannot shun;\nBut such there are, whose minds, not taught to stoop,\nYet hope for fame, and dare avow their hope,\nWho neither brave the judges of their cause,\nNor beg in soothing strains a brief applause.\nAnd such I'd be;--and ere my fate is past,\nEre clear'd with honour, or with culprits cast,\nHumbly at Learning's bar I'll state my case,\nAnd welcome then distinction or disgrace!\n   When in the man the flights of fancy reign,\nRule in the heart or revel in the brain,\nAs busy Thought her wild creation apes,\nAnd hangs delighted o'er her varying shapes,\nIt asks a judgment, weighty and discreet,\nTo know where wisdom prompts, and where conceit.\nAlike their draughts to every scribbler's mind\n(Blind to their faults as to their danger blind); -\nWe write enraptured, and we write in haste,\nDream idle dreams, and call them things of taste,\nImprovement trace in every paltry line,\nAnd see, transported, every dull design;\nAre seldom cautious, all advice detest,\nAnd ever think our own opinions best;\nNor shows my Muse a muse-like spirit here,\nWho bids me pause, before I persevere.\n   But she--who shrinks while meditating flight\nIn the wide way, whose bounds delude her sight,\nYet tired in her own mazes still to roam,\nAnd cull poor banquets for the soul at home,\nWould, ere she ventures, ponder on the way,\nLest dangers yet unthought of, flight betray;\nLest her Icarian wing, by wits unplumed,\nBe robb'd of all the honours she assumed;\nAnd Dulness swell,--a black and dismal sea,\nGaping her grave; while censures madden me.\n   Such was his fate, who flew too near the sun,\nShot far beyond his strength, and was undone;\nSuch is his fate, who creeping at the shore\nThe billow sweeps him, and he's found no more.\nOh! for some god, to bear my fortunes fair\nMidway betwixt presumption and despair!\n   \"Has then some friendly critic's former blow\nTaught thee a prudence authors seldom know?\"\n   Not so! their anger and their love untried,\nA woe-taught prudence deigns to tend my side:\nLife's hopes ill-sped, the Muse's hopes grow poor,\nAnd though they flatter, yet they charm no more;\nExperience points where lurking dangers lay,\nAnd as I run, throws caution in my way.\n   There was a night, when wintry winds did rage,\nHard by a ruin'd pile, I meet a sage;\nResembling him the time-struck place appear'd,\nHollow its voice, and moss its spreading beard;\nWhose fate-lopp'd brow, the bat's and beetle's dome,\nShook, as the hunted owl flew hooting home.\nHis breast was bronzed by many an eastern blast,\nAnd fourscore winters seem'd he to have past;\nHis thread-bare coat the supple osier bound,\nAnd with slow feet he press'd the sodden ground,\nWhere, as he heard the wild-wing'd Eurus blow,\nHe shook, from locks as white, December's snow;\nInured to storm, his soul ne'er bid it cease,\nBut lock'd within him meditated peace.\n   Father, I said--for silver hairs inspire,\nAnd oft I call the bending peasant Sire -\nTell me, as here beneath this ivy bower,\nThat works fantastic round its trembling tower,\nWe hear Heaven's guilt-alarming thunders roar,\nTell me the pains and pleasures of the poor;\nFor Hope, just spent, requires a sad adieu,\nAnd Fear acquaints me I shall live with you.\n   There was a time when, by Delusion led,\nA scene of sacred bliss around me spread,\nOn Hope's, as Pisgah's lofty top, I stood,\nAnd saw my Canaan there, my promised good;\nA thousand scenes of joy the clime bestow'd,\nAnd wine and oil through vision's valleys flow'd;\nAs Moses his, I call'd my prospect bless'd,\nAnd gazed upon the good I ne'er possess'd:\nOn this side Jordan doom'd by fate to stand,\nWhilst happier Joshuas win the promised land.\n\"Son,\" said the Sage--\"be this thy care suppress'd;\nThe state the gods shall chose thee is the best:\nRich if thou art, they ask thy praises more,\nAnd would thy patience when they make thee poor;\nBut other thoughts within thy bosom reign,\nAnd other subjects vex thy busy brain,\nPoetic wreaths thy vainer dreams excite,\nAnd thy sad stars have destined thee to write.\nThen since that task the ruthless fates decree,\nTake a few precepts from the gods and me!\n   \"Be not too eager in the arduous chase;\nWho pants for triumph seldom wins the race:\nVenture not all, but wisely hoard thy worth,\nAnd let thy labours one by one go forth:\nSome happier scrap capricious wits may find\nOn a fair day, and be profusely kind;\nWhich, buried in the rubbish of a throng,\nHad pleased as little as a new-year's song,\nOr lover's verse, that cloy'd with nauseous sweet,\nOr birth-day ode, that ran on ill-pair'd feet.\nMerit not always--Fortune feeds the bard,\nAnd as the whim inclines bestows reward:\nNone without wit, nor with it numbers gain;\nTo please is hard, but none shall please in vain:\nAs a coy mistress is the humour'd town,\nLoth every lover with success to crown;\nHe who would win must every effort try,\nSail in the mode, and to the fashion fly;\nMust gay or grave to every humour dress,\nAnd watch the lucky Moment of Success;\nThat caught, no more his eager hopes are crost;\nBut vain are Wit and Love, when that is lost.\"\n   Thus said the god; for now a god he grew\nHis white locks changing to a golden hue,\nAnd from his shoulders hung a mantle azure-blue.\nHis softening eyes the winning charm disclosed\nOf dove-like Delia when her doubts reposed;\nMira's alone a softer lustre bear,\nWhen woe beguiles them of an angel's tear;\nBeauteous and young the smiling phantom stood,\nThen sought on airy wing his blest abode.\n   Ah! truth, distasteful in poetic theme,\nWhy is the Muse compell'd to own her dream?\nWhilst forward wits had sworn to every line,\nI only wish to make its moral mine.\n   Say then, O ye who tell how authors speed,\nMay Hope indulge her flight, and I succeed?\nSay, shall my name, to future song prefixed,\nBe with the meanest of the tuneful mix'd?\nShall my soft strains the modest maid engage,\nMy graver numbers move the silver \"d sage,\nMy tender themes delight the lover's heart,\nAnd comfort to the poor my solemn songs impart?\n   For Oh! thou Hope's, thou Thought's eternal King,\nWho gav'st them power to charm, and me to sing -\nChief to thy praise my willing numbers soar,\nAnd in my happier transports I adore;\nMercy! thy softest attribute proclaim,\nThyself in abstract, thy more lovely name;\nThat flings o'er all my grief a cheering ray,\nAs the full moon-beam gilds the watery way.\nAnd then too, Love, my soul's resistless lord,\nShall many a gentle, generous strain afford,\nTo all the soil of sooty passion blind,\nPure as embracing angels and as kind;\nOur Mira's name in future times shall shine,\nAnd--though the harshest--Shepherds envy mine.\n   Then let me (pleasing task!) however hard,\nJoin, as of old, the prophet and the bard;\nIf not, ah! shield me from the dire disgrace,\nThat haunts our wild and visionary race;\nLet me not draw my lengthen'd lines along,\nAnd tire in untamed infamy of song,\nLest, in some dismal Dunciad's future page,\nI stand the CIBBER of this tuneless age;\nLest, in another POPE th' indulgent skies\nShould give inspired by all their deities,\nMy luckless name, in his immortal strain,\nShould, blasted, brand me as a second Cain;\nDoom'd in that song to live against my will,\nWhom all must scorn, and yet whom none could kill.\n   The youth, resisted by the maiden's art,\nPersists, and time subdues her kindling heart;\nTo strong entreaty yields the widow's vow,\nAs mighty walls to bold beseigers bow;\nRepeated prayers draw bounty from the sky,\nAnd heaven is won by importunity;\nOurs, a projecting tribe, pursue in vain,\nIn tedious trials, an uncertain gain;\nMadly plunge on through every hope's defeat,\nAnd with our ruin only find the cheat.\n   \"And why then seek that luckless doom to share?\"\nWho, I?--To shun it is my only care.\n   I grant it true, that others better tell\nOf mighty WOLFE, who conquer'd as he fell;\nOf heroes born, their threaten'd realms to save,\nWhom Fame anoints, and Envy tends whose grave;\nOf crimson'd fields, where Fate, in dire array,\nGives to the breathless the short-breathing clay;\nOurs, a young train, by humbler fountains dream,\nNor taste presumptuous the Pierian stream;\nWhen Rodney's triumph comes on eagle-wing,\nWe hail the victor whom we fear to sing;\nNor tell we how each hostile chief goes on,\nThe luckless Lee, or wary Washington;\nHow Spanish bombast blusters--they were beat,\nAnd French politeness dulcifies--defeat.\nMy modest Muse forbears to speak of kings,\nLest fainting stanzas blast the name she sings;\nFor who--the tenant of the beechen shade,\nDares the big thought in regal breasts pervade?\nOr search his soul, whom each too-favouring god\nGives to delight in plunder, pomp, and blood?\nNo; let me free from Cupid's frolic round,\nRejoice, or more rejoice by Cupid bound;\nOf laughing girls in smiling couplets tell,\nAnd paint the dark-brow'd grove, where wood-nymphs dwell;\nWho bid invading youths their vengeance feel,\nAnd pierce the votive hearts they mean to heal.\nSuch were the themes I knew in school-day ease,\nWhen first the moral magic learn'd to please,\nEre Judgment told how transports warm'd the breast,\nTransported Fancy there her stores imprest;\nThe soul in varied raptures learn'd to fly,\nFelt all their force, and never question'd why;\nNo idle doubts could then her peace molest,\nShe found delight, and left to heaven the rest;\nSoft joys in Evening's placid shades were born;\nAnd where sweet fragrance wing'd the balmy morn,\nWhen the wild thought roved vision's circuit o'er,\nAnd caught the raptures, caught, alas! no more:\nNo care did then a dull attention ask,\nFor study pleased, and that was every task;\nNo guilty dreams stalk'd that heaven-favour'd round,\nHeaven-guarded, too, no Envy entrance found;\nNor numerous wants, that vex advancing age,\nNor Flattery's silver tale, nor Sorrow's sage;\nFrugal Affliction kept each growing dart,\nTo o'erwhelm in future days the bleeding heart.\nNo sceptic art veil'd Pride in Truth's disguise,\nBut prayer unsoil'd of doubt besieged the skies;\nAmbition, avarice, care, to man retired,\nNor came desires more quick than joys desired.\n   A summer morn there was, and passing fair,\nStill was the breeze, and health perfumed the air;\nThe glowing east in crimson'd splendour shone,\nWhat time the eye just marks the pallid moon,\nVi'let-wing'd Zephyr fann'd each opening flower,\nAnd brush'd from fragrant cups the limpid shower;\nA distant huntsman fill'd his cheerful horn,\nThe vivid dew hung trembling on the thorn,\nAnd mists, like creeping rocks, arose to meet the morn.\nHuge giant shadows spread along the plain,\nOr shot from towering rocks o'er half the main,\nThere to the slumbering bark the gentle tide\nStole soft, and faintly beat against its side;\nSuch is that sound, which fond designs convey,\nWhen, true to love, the damsel speeds away;\nThe sails unshaken, hung aloft unfurl'd,\nAnd simpering nigh, the languid current curl'd;\nA crumbling ruin, once a city's pride,\nThe well-pleased eye through withering oaks descried,\nWhere Sadness, gazing on time's ravage, hung,\nAnd Silence to Destruction's trophy clung -\nSave that as morning songsters swell'd their lays,\nAwaken'd Echo humm'd repeated praise:\nThe lark on quavering pinion woo'd the day,\nLess towering linnets fill'd the vocal spray,\nAnd song-invited pilgrims rose to pray.\nHere at a pine-press'd hill's embroider'd base\nI stood, and hail'd the Genius of the place.\n   Then was it doom'd by fate, my idle heart,\nSoften'd by Nature, gave access to Art;\nThe Muse approach'd, her syren-song I heard,\nHer magic felt, and all her charms revered:\nE'er since she rules in absolute control,\nAnd Mira only dearer to my soul.\nAh! tell me not these empty joys to fly,\nIf they deceive, I would deluded die;\nTo the fond themes my heart so early wed,\nSo soon in life to blooming visions led,\nSo prone to run the vague uncertain course,\n'Tis more than death to think of a divorce.\n   What wills the poet of the favouring gods,\nLed to their shrine, and blest in their abodes?\nWhat when he fills the glass, and to each youth\nNames his loved maid, and glories in his truth?\nNot India's spoils, the splended nabob's pride,\nNot the full trade of Hermes' own Cheapside,\nNor gold itself, nor all the Ganges laves,\nOr shrouds, well shrouded in his sacred waves;\nNor gorgeous vessels deck'd in trim array,\nWhich the more noble Thames bears far away;\nLet those whose nod makes sooty subjects flee?\nHack with blunt steel the savory callipee;\nLet those whose ill-used wealth their country fly,\nVirtue-scorn'd wines from hostile France to buy;\nFavour'd by Fate, let such in joy appear,\nTheir smuggled cargoes landed thrice a year;\nDisdaining these, for simpler food I'll look,\nAnd crop my beverage at the mantled brook.\n   O Virtue! brighter than the noon-tide ray,\nMy humble prayers with sacred joys repay!\nHealth to my limbs may the kind gods impart,\nAnd thy fair form delight my yielding heart!\nGrant me to shun each vile inglorious road,\nTo see thy way, and trace each moral good:\nIf more--let Wisdom's sons my page peruse,\nAnd decent credit deck my modest Muse.\n   Nor deem it pride that prophesies my song\nShall please the sons of taste, and please them long.\nSay ye! to whom my Muse submissive brings\nHer first-fruit offering, and on trembling wings,\nMay she not hope in future days to soar,\nWhere fancy's sons have led the way before?\nWhere genius strives in each ambrosial bower\nTo snatch with agile hand the opening flower?\nTo cull what sweets adorn the mountain's brow,\nWhat humbler blossoms crown the vales below?\nTo blend with these the stores by art refined,\nAnd give the moral Flora to the mind?\n   Far other scenes my timid hour admits,\nRelentless critics and avenging wits;\nE'en coxcombs take a licence from their pen,\nAnd to each \"Let him perish,\" cry Amen!\nAnd thus, with wits or fools my heart shall cry,\nFor if they please not, let the trifles die:\nDie, and be lost in dark oblivion's shore,\nAnd never rise to vex their author more.\n   I would not dream o'er some soft liquid line,\nAmid a thousand blunders form'd to shine;\nYet rather this, than that dull scribbler be,\nFrom every fault and every beauty free,\nCurst with tame thoughts and mediocrity.\nSome have I found so thick beset with spots,\n'Twas hard to trace their beauties through their blots;\nAnd these, as tapers round a sick man's room\nOr passing chimes, but warn'd me of the tomb!\n   O! if you blast, at once consume my bays,\nAnd damn me not with mutilated praise.\nWith candour judge; and, a young bard in view,\nAllow for that, and judge with kindness too;\nFaults he must own, though hard for him to find,\nNot to some happier merits quite so blind;\nThese if mistaken Fancy only sees,\nOr Hope, that takes Deformity for these:\nIf Dunce, the crowd-befitting title falls\nHis lot, and Dulness her new subject calls,\nTo the poor bard alone your censures give -\nLet his fame die, but let his honour live;\nLaugh if you must--be candid as you can,\nAnd when you lash the Poet, spare the Man.\n\n\n\nFootnotes:\n\n{1}  First published in Ipswich, 1775.\n\n{2}  First published 1780.",
