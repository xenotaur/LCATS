    "body": "By L. J. STECHER, JR.\n\n\nThe sight of an Earthman on Vega III, where it was impossible for an\noutlander to be, brought angry crowds to surround John Crownwall as he\nstrode toward the palace of Viceroy Tronn Ffallk, ruler of Sector XII of\nthe Universal Holy Empire of Sunda. He ignored the snarling, the\nspitting, the waving of boneless prehensile fingers, as he ignored the\nheavy gravity and heavier air of the unfamiliar planet.\n\nJohn Crownwall, florid, red-headed and bulky, considered himself to be a\nbold man. But here, surrounded by this writhing, slithering mass of\neight-foot creatures, he felt distinctly unhappy. Crownwall had heard\nabout creatures that slavered, but he had never before seen it done.\nThese humanoids had large mouths and sharp teeth, and they\nunquestionably slavered. He wished he knew more about them. If they\ncarried out the threats of their present attitude, Earth would have to\nsend Marshall to replace him. And if Crownwall couldn't do the job,\nthought Crownwall, then it was a sure bet that Marshall wouldn't have a\nchance.\n\nHe climbed the great ramp, with its deeply carved Greek key design,\ntoward the mighty entrance gate of the palace. His manner demonstrated\nan elaborate air of unconcern that he felt sure was entirely wasted on\nthese monsters. The clashing teeth of the noisiest of them were only\ninches from the quivering flesh of his back as he reached the upper\nlevel. Instantly, and unexpectedly to Crownwall, the threatening crowd\ndropped back fearfully, so that he walked the last fifty meters alone.\n\nCrownwall all but sagged with relief. A pair of guards, their purple\nhides smoothly polished and gleaming with oil, crossed their ceremonial\npikes in front of him as he approached the entrance.\n\n\"And just what business do you have here, stranger?\" asked the senior of\nthe guards, his speaking orifice framing with difficulty the sibilances\nof Universal Galactic.\n\n\"What business _would_ I have at the Viceroy's Palace?\" asked Crownwall.\n\"I want to see Ffallk.\"\n\n\"Mind your tongue,\" growled the guard. \"If you mean His Effulgence,\nRight Hand of the Glorious Emperor, Hereditary Ruler of the Seventy\nSuns, Viceroy of the Twelfth Sector of the Universal Holy\nEmpire\"--Universal Galactic had a full measure of ceremonial words--\"he\nsees only those whom he summons. If you know what's good for you, you'll\nget out of here while you can still walk. And if you run fast enough,\nmaybe you can even get away from that crowd out there, but I doubt it.\"\n\n\"Just tell him that a man has arrived from Earth to talk to him. He'll\nsummon me fast enough. Meanwhile, my highly polished friends, I'll just\nwait here, so why don't you put those heavy pikes down?\"\n\nCrownwall sat on the steps, puffed alight a cigarette, and blew expert\nsmoke rings toward the guards.\n\nAn elegant courtier, with elaborately jeweled harness, bustled from\ninside the palace, obviously trying to present an air of strolling\nnonchalance. He gestured fluidly with a graceful tentacle. \"You!\" he\nsaid to Crownwall. \"Follow me. His Effulgence commands you to appear\nbefore him at once.\" The two guards withdrew their pikes and froze into\nimmobility at the sides of the entrance.\n\nCrownwall stamped out his smoke and ambled after the hurrying courtier\nalong tremendous corridors, through elaborate waiting rooms, under\nguarded doorways, until he was finally bowed through a small curtained\narch.\n\nAt the far side of the comfortable, unimpressive room, a plump thing,\nhide faded to a dull violet, reclined on a couch. Behind him stood a\nheavy and pompous appearing Vegan in lordly trappings. They examined\nCrownwall with great interest for a few moments.\n\n\"It's customary to genuflect when you enter the Viceroy's presence,\"\nsaid the standing one at last. \"But then I'm told you're an Earthling. I\nsuppose we can expect you to be ignorant of those niceties customary\namong civilized peoples.\"\n\n\"It's all right, Ggaran,\" said the Viceroy languidly. He twitched a\ntentacle in a beckoning gesture. \"Come closer, Earthling. I bid you\nwelcome to my capital. I have been looking forward to your arrival for\nsome time.\"\n\n\n\nCrownwall put his hands in his pockets. \"That's hardly possible,\" he\nsaid. \"It was only decided yesterday, back on Earth, that I would be the\none to make the trip here. Even if you could spy through buildings on\nEarth from space, which I doubt, your communications system can't get\nthe word through that fast.\"\n\n\"Oh, I didn't mean _you_ in particular,\" the Vegan said with a negligent\nwave. \"Who can tell one Earthling from another? What I meant was that I\nexpected someone from Earth to break through our blockade and come here.\nMost of my advisors--even Ggaran here--thought it couldn't be done, but\nI never doubted that you'd manage it. Still, if you were on your home\nplanet only yesterday, that's astonishing even to me. Tell me, how did\nyou manage to get here so fast, and without even alerting my detection\nweb?\"\n\n\"You're doing the talking,\" said Crownwall. \"If you wanted someone from\nEarth to come here to see you, why did you put the cordon around Earth?\nAnd why did you drop a planet-buster in the Pacific Ocean, and tell us\nthat it was triggered to go off if we tried to use the distorter drive?\nThat's hardly the action of somebody who expects visitors.\"\n\nFfallk glanced up at Ggaran. \"I told you that Earthlings were\nunbelievably bold.\" He turned back to Crownwall. \"If you couldn't come\nto me in spite of the trifling inconveniences I put in your way, your\npresence here would be useless to both of us. But you did come, so I can\ntell you that although I am the leader of one of the mightiest peoples\nin the Galaxy, whereas there are scarcely six billions of you squatting\non one minor planet, we still need each other. Together, there is\nnothing we can't do.\"\n\n\"I'm listening,\" said Crownwall.\n\n\"We offer you partnership with us to take over the rule of the Galaxy\nfrom the Sunda--the so-called Master Race.\"\n\n\"It would hardly be an equal partnership, would it, considering that\nthere are so many more of you than there are of us?\"\n\nHis Effulgence twitched his ear stalks in amusement. \"I'm Viceroy of one\nof the hundred Sectors of the Empire. I rule over a total of a hundred\nSatrapies; these average about a hundred Provinces each. Provinces\nconsist, in general, of about a hundred Clusters apiece, and every\nCluster has an average of a hundred inhabited solar systems. There are\nmore inhabited planets in the Galaxy than there are people on your\nsingle world. I, personally, rule three hundred trillion people, half of\nthem of my own race. And yet I tell you that it would be an equal\npartnership.\"\n\n\"I don't get it. Why?\"\n\n\"Because you came to me.\"\n\nCrownwall shrugged. \"So?\"\n\n\n\nThe Vegan reached up and engulfed the end of a drinking tube with his\neating orifice. \"You upstart Earthlings are a strange and a frightening\nrace,\" he said. \"Frightening to the Sunda, especially. When you showed\nup in the spaceways, it was decreed that you had to be stopped at once.\nThere was even serious discussion of destroying Earth out of hand, while\nit is still possible.\n\n\"Your silly little planet was carefully examined at long range in a\nroutine investigation just about fifty thousand years ago. There were at\nthat time three different but similar racial strains of pulpy bipeds,\nnumbering a total of perhaps a hundred thousand individuals. They showed\nmany signs of an ability to reason, but a complete lack of civilization.\nWhile these creatures could by no means be classed among the intelligent\nraces, there was a general expectation, which we reported to the Sunda,\nthat they would some day come to be numbered among the Servants of the\nEmperor. So we let you alone, in order that you could develop in your\nown way, until you reached a high enough civilization to be useful--if\nyou were going to.\n\n\"Intelligence is very rare in the Galaxy. In all, it has been found only\nfifteen times. The other races we have watched develop, and some we have\nactively assisted to develop. It took the quickest of them just under a\nmillion years. One such race we left uncontrolled too long--but no\nmatter.\n\n\"You Earthlings, in defiance of all expectation and all reason, have\nexploded into space. You have developed in an incredibly short space of\ntime. But even that isn't the most disconcerting item of your\ndevelopment. As an Earthling, you have heard of the details of the first\nexpedition of your people into space, of course?\"\n\n\"_Heard_ about it?\" exclaimed Crownwall. \"I was _on_ it.\" He settled\ndown comfortably on a couch, without requesting permission, and thought\nback to that first tremendous adventure; an adventure that had taken\nplace little more than ten years before.\n\nThe _Star Seeker_ had been built in space, about forty thousand\nkilometers above the Earth. It had been manned by a dozen adventurous\npeople, captained by Crownwall, and had headed out on its ion drive\nuntil it was safely clear of the warping influence of planetary masses.\nThen, after several impatient days of careful study and calculation, the\ndistorter drive had been activated, for the first time in Earth's\nhistory, and, for the twelve, the stars had winked out.\n\nThe men of Earth had decided that it should work in theory. They had\nbuilt the drive--a small machine, as drives go--but they had never dared\nto try it, close to a planet. To do so, said their theory, would\nusually--seven point three four times out of 10--destroy the ship, and\neverything in space for thousands of miles around, in a ravening burst\nof raw energy.\n\nSo the drive had been used for the first time without ever having been\ntested. And it had worked.\n\nIn less than a week's time, if time has any meaning under such\ncircumstances, they had flickered back into normal space, in the\nvicinity of Alpha Centauri. They had quickly located a dozen planets,\nand one that looked enough like Earth to be its twin sister. They had\nheaded for that planet confidently and unsuspectingly, using the ion\ndrive.\n\nTwo weeks later, while they were still several planetary diameters from\ntheir destination, they had been shocked to find more than two score\nalien ships of space closing in on them--ships that were swifter and\nmore maneuverable than their own. These ships had rapidly and\ncompetently englobed the _Star Seeker_, and had then tried to herd it\naway from the planet it had been heading toward.\n\n\n\nAlthough caught by surprise, the Earthmen had acted swiftly. Crownwall\nrecalled the discussion--the council of war, they had called it--and\ntheir unanimous decision. Although far within the dangerous influence of\na planetary mass, they had again activated the distorter drive, and they\nhad beaten the odds. On the distorter drive, they had returned to Earth\nas swiftly as they had departed. Earth had immediately prepared for war\nagainst her unknown enemy.\n\n\"Your reaction was savage,\" said Ggaran, his tentacles stiffening with\nshock at the memory. \"You bloody-minded Earthlings must have been aware\nof the terrible danger.\"\n\nFfallk rippled in agreement. \"The action you took was too swift and too\nfoolhardy to be believed. You knew that you could have destroyed not\nonly yourself, but also all who live on that planet. You could also have\nwrecked the planet itself and the ships and those of my own race who\nmanned them. We had tried to contact you, but since you had not\ndeveloped subspace radio, we were of course not successful. Our\nenglobement was just a routine quarantine. With your total lack of\ninformation about us, what you did was more than the height of folly. It\nwas madness.\"\n\n\"Could we have done anything else that would have kept you from landing\non Earth and taking us over?\" asked Crownwall.\n\n\"Would that have been so bad?\" said Ggaran. \"We can't tolerate wild and\nwarlike races running free and uncontrolled in the Galaxy. Once was\nenough for that.\"\n\n\"But what about my question? Was there any other way for us to stay\nfree?\"\n\n\"Well, no. But you didn't have enough information to realize that when\nyou acted so precipitously. As a matter of fact, we didn't expect to\nhave much trouble, even after your surprising action. Of course, it took\nus a little time to react. We located your planet quickly enough, and\nconfirmed that you were a new race. But by the time we could try to set\nup communications and send ambassadors, you had already organized a not\ninconsiderable defense. Your drones blew up our unmanned ships as fast\nas we could send them down to your planet. And by the time we had\norganized properly for war against you, it was obvious that we could not\nconquer you. We could only destroy you.\"\n\n\"That old fool on Sunda, the Emperor, decided that we should blow you\nup, but by that time I had decided,\" said His Effulgence, \"that you\nmight be useful to me--that is, that we might be useful to each other. I\ntraveled halfway across the Galaxy to meet him, to convince him that it\nwould be sufficient just to quarantine you. When we had used your radio\nsystem to teach a few of you the Universal Galactic tongue, and had\nmanaged to get what you call the 'planet-buster' down into the largest\nof your oceans, he figured we had done our job.\n\n\"With his usual lack of imagination, he felt sure that we were safe from\nyou--after all, there was no way for you to get off the planet. Even if\nyou could get down to the bottom of the ocean and tamper with the bomb,\nyou would only succeed in setting it off, and that's what the Sunda had\nbeen in favor of in the first place.\n\n\"But I had different ideas. From what you had already done, I suspected\nit wouldn't be long before one of you amazing Earthlings would dream up\nsome device or other, head out into space, and show up on our planet. So\nI've been waiting for you, and here you are.\"\n\n\"It was the thinking of a genius,\" murmured Ggaran.\n\n\"All right, then, genius, here I am,\" said Crownwall. \"So what's the\npitch?\"\n\n\"Ggaran, you explain it to the Earthling,\" said His Effulgence.\n\n\n\nGgaran bowed. \"The crustaceans on Sunda--the lobsterlike creatures that\nrule the Galaxy--are usurpers. They have no rights to their position of\npower. Our race is much older than theirs. We were alone when we found\nthe Sundans--a primitive tribe, grubbing in the mud at the edge of their\nshallow seas, unable even to reason. In those days we were desperately\nlonely. We needed companionship among the stars, and we helped them\ndevelop to the point where, in their inferior way, they were able to\nreason, almost as well as we, The People, can. And then they cheated us\nof our rightful place.\n\n\"The Emperor at Sunda is one of them. They provide sixty-eight of the\nhundred Viceroys; we provide only seventeen. It is a preposterous and\nintolerable situation.\n\n\"For more than two million years we have waited for the opportunity for\nrevenge. And now that you have entered space, that opportunity is at\nhand.\"\n\n\"If you haven't been able to help yourselves for two million years,\"\nasked Crownwall, \"how does the sight of me give you so much gumption all\nof a sudden?\"\n\nGgaran's tentacles writhed, and he slavered in fury, but the clashing of\nhis teeth subsided instantly at a soothing wave from His Effulgence.\n\n\"War in space is almost an impossibility,\" said the aged ruler. \"We can\ndestroy planets, of course, but with few exceptions, we cannot conquer\nthem. I rule a total of seven races in my Sector. I rule them, but I\ndon't let them intermingle. Each race settles on the planets that best\nsuit it. Each of those planets is quite capable of defending itself from\nraids, or even large-scale assaults that would result in its capture and\nsubjugation--just as your little Earth can defend itself.\n\n\"Naturally, each is vulnerable to economic blockade--trade provides a\nsmall but vital portion of the goods each planet uses. All that a world\nrequires for a healthy and comfortable life cannot be provided from the\nresources of that single world alone, and that gives us a very\nconsiderable measure of control.\n\n\"And it is true that we can always exterminate any planet that refuses\nto obey the just and legal orders of its Viceroy. So we achieve a\nworking balance in our Empire. We control it adequately, and we live in\npeace.\n\n\"The Sundans, for example, though they took the rule of the Empire that\nwas rightfully ours away from us, through trickery, were unable to take\nover the Sectors we control. We are still powerful. And soon we will be\nall-powerful. In company with you Earthlings, that is.\"\n\nCrownwall nodded. \"In other words, you think that we Earthmen can break\nup this two-million-year-old stalemate. You've got the idea that, with\nour help, you can conquer planets without the necessity of destroying\nthem, and thereby take over number one spot from these Sunda friends of\nyours.\"\n\n\"Don't call those damn lobsters friends,\" growled Ggaran. He subsided at\nthe Viceroy's gesture.\n\n\"Exactly,\" said His Effulgence to Crownwall. \"You broke our blockade\nwithout any trouble. Our instruments didn't even wiggle when you landed\nhere on my capital world. You can do the same on the worlds of the\nSunda. Now, just tell us how you did it, and we're partners.\"\n\n\n\nCrownwall lifted one eyebrow quizzically, but remained silent. He didn't\nexpect his facial gesture to be interpreted correctly, but he assumed\nthat his silence would be. He was correct.\n\n\"Of course,\" His Effulgence said, \"we will give you any assurances that\nyour people may desire in order to feel safe, and we will guarantee them\nan equal share in the government of the Galaxy.\"\n\n\"Bunk,\" said Crownwall.\n\nHis Effulgence lifted a tentacle swiftly, before Ggaran, lunging angrily\nforward, could speak. \"Then what do you want of us?\"\n\n\"It seems to me that we need no wordy assurances from each other,\" said\nCrownwall, and he puffed a cigarette aglow. \"We can arrange something a\nlittle more trustworthy, I believe. On your side, you have the power to\ndestroy our only planet at any time. That is certainly adequate security\nfor our own good behavior and sincerity.\n\n\"It is impossible for us of Earth to destroy all of your planets. As you\nhave said, there are more planets that belong to you than there are\nhuman beings on Earth. But there is a way for us to be reasonably sure\nthat you will behave yourselves. You will transfer to us, at once, a\nhundred of your planet-destroying bombs. That will be a sufficient\nsupply to let us test some of them, to see that they are in good working\norder. Then, if you try any kind of double-cross, we will be able to use\nour own methods--which you cannot prevent--to send one of those bombs\nhere to destroy this planet.\n\n\"And if you try to move anywhere else, by your clumsy distorter drive,\nwe can follow you, and destroy any planet you choose to land on. You\nwould not get away from us. We can track you without any difficulty.\n\n\"We wouldn't use the bombs lightly, to be sure, because of what would\nhappen to Earth. And don't think that blowing up our planet would save\nyou, because we naturally wouldn't keep the bombs on Earth. How does\nthat sound to you?\"\n\n\"Ridiculous,\" snorted Ggaran. \"Impossible.\"\n\nAfter several minutes of silent consideration, \"It is an excellent\nplan,\" said His Effulgence. \"It is worthy of the thinking of The People\nourselves. You Earthlings will make very satisfactory allies. What you\nrequest will be provided without delay. Meanwhile, I see no reason why\nwe cannot proceed with our discussions.\"\n\n\"Nor do I,\" consented Crownwall. \"But your stooge here doesn't seem very\nhappy about it all.\"\n\nHis Effulgence wiggled his tentacles. \"I'm afraid that Ggaran had\nexpected to take what you Earthlings have to offer without giving\nanything in return. I never had any such ideas. I have not\nunderestimated you, you see.\"\n\n\"That's nice,\" said Crownwall graciously.\n\n\"And now,\" Ggaran put in, \"I think it's time for you to tell us\nsomething about how you get across light-years of space in a few hours,\nwithout leaving any traces for us to detect.\" He raised a tentacle to\nstill Crownwall's immediate exclamation of protest. \"Oh, nothing that\nwould give us a chance to duplicate it--just enough to _indicate_ how we\ncan make use of it, along with you--enough to allow us to _begin_ to\nmake intelligent plans to beat the claws off the Master Race.\"\n\n\n\nAfter due consideration, Crownwall nodded. \"I don't see why not. Well,\nthen, let me tell you that we don't travel in space at all. That's why I\ndidn't show up on any of your long-range detection instruments. Instead,\nwe travel in time. Surely any race that has progressed as far as your\nown must know, at least theoretically, that time travel is entirely\npossible. After all, we knew it, and we haven't been around nearly as\nlong as you have.\"\n\n\"We know about it,\" said Ffallk, \"but we've always considered it\nuseless--and very dangerous--knowledge.\"\n\n\"So have we, up until the time you planted that bomb on us. Anyone who\ntried to work any changes in his own past would be almost certain to end\nup finding himself never having been born. So we don't do any meddling.\nWhat we have discovered is a way not only of moving back into the past,\nbut also of making our own choice of spatial references while we do it,\nand of changing our spatial anchor at will.\n\n\"For example, to reach this planet, I went back far enough, using Earth\nas the spatial referent, to move with Earth a little more than a third\nof the way around this spiral nebula that is our Galaxy. Then I shifted\nmy frame of reference to that of the group of galaxies of which ours is\nsuch a distinguished member.\n\n\"Then of course, as I continued to move in time, the whole Galaxy moved\nspatially with reference to my own position. At the proper instant I\nshifted again, to the reference frame of this Galaxy itself. Then I was\nstationary in the Galaxy, and as I continued time traveling, your own\nmighty sun moved toward me as the Galaxy revolved. I chose a point where\nthere was a time intersection of your planet's position and my own. When\nyou got there, I just changed to the reference plane of this planet I'm\non now, and then came on back with it to the present. So here I am. It\nwas a long way around to cover a net distance of 26 light-years, but it\nwas really very simple.\n\n\"And there's no danger of meeting myself, or getting into any\nanachronistic situation. As you probably know, theory shows that these\nare excluded times for me, as is the future--I can't stop in them.\"\n\n\"Are you sure that you haven't given us a little too much information\nfor your own safety?\" asked Ffallk softly.\n\n\"Not at all. We were enormously lucky to have learned how to control\nspatial reference frames ourselves. I doubt if you could do it in\nanother two million years.\" Crownwall rose to his feet. \"And now, Your\nEffulgence, I think it's about time I went back to my ship and drove it\nhome to Earth to make my report, so we can pick up those bombs and start\nmaking arrangements.\"\n\n\"Excellent,\" said Ffallk. \"I'd better escort you; my people don't like\nstrangers much.\"\n\n\"I'd noticed that,\" Crownwall commented drily.\n\n\"Since this is a very important occasion, I think it best that we make\nthis a Procession of Full Ceremony. It's a bother, but the proprieties\nhave to be observed.\"\n\n\n\nGgaran stepped out into the broad corridor and whistled a shrill\ntwo-tone note, using both his speaking and his eating orifices. A cohort\nof troops, pikes at the ready and bows strapped to their backs, leaped\nforward and formed a double line leading from His Effulgence's sanctum\nto the main door. Down this lane, carried by twenty men, came a large\nsedan chair.\n\n\"Protocol takes a lot of time,\" said His Effulgence somewhat sadly, \"but\nit must be observed. At least, as Ambassador, you can ride with me in\nthe sedan, instead of walking behind it, like Ggaran.\"\n\n\"I'm glad of that,\" said Crownwall. \"Too bad Ggaran can't join us.\" He\nclimbed into the chair beside Ffallk. The bearers trotted along at seven\nor eight kilometers an hour, carrying their contraption with absolute\nsmoothness. Blasts from horns preceded them as they went.\n\nWhen they passed through the huge entrance doors of the palace and\nstarted down the ramp toward the street, Crownwall was astonished to see\nnobody on the previously crowded streets, and mentioned it to Ffallk.\n\n\"When the Viceroy of the Seventy Suns,\" said the Viceroy of the Seventy\nSuns, \"travels in state, no one but my own entourage is permitted to\nwatch. And my guests, of course,\" he added, bowing slightly to\nCrownwall.\n\n\"Of course,\" agreed Crownwall, bowing back. \"Kind of you, I'm sure. But\nwhat happens if somebody doesn't get the word, or doesn't hear your\ntrumpeters, or something like that?\"\n\nGgaran stepped forward, already panting slightly. \"A man with knots in\nall of his ear stalks is in a very uncomfortable position,\" he\nexplained. \"Wait. Let me show you. Let us just suppose that that runner\nover there\"--he gestured toward a soldier with a tentacle--\"is a\ncivilian who has been so unlucky as to remain on the street after His\nEffulgence's entourage arrived.\" He turned to one of the bowmen who ran\nbeside the sedan chair, now strung and at the ready. \"Show him!\" he\nordered peremptorily.\n\nIn one swift movement the bowman notched an arrow, drew and fired. The\narrow hissed briefly, and then sliced smoothly through the soldier's\nthroat.\n\n\"You see,\" said Ggaran complacently, \"we have very little trouble with\ncivilians who violate this particular tradition.\"\n\nHis Effulgence beckoned to the bowman to approach. \"Your results were\nsatisfactory,\" he said, \"but your release was somewhat shaky. The next\ntime you show such sloppy form, you will be given thirty lashes.\"\n\nHe leaned back on the cushion and spoke again to Crownwall. \"That's the\ntrouble with these requirements of civilization. The men of my immediate\nguard must practice with such things as pikes and bows and arrows, which\nthey seldom get an opportunity to use. It would never do for them to use\nmodern weapons on occasions of ceremony, of course.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Crownwall, then added, \"It's too bad that you can't\nprovide them with live targets a little more often.\" He stifled a\nshudder of distaste. \"Tell me, Your Effulgence, does the Emperor's\nrace--the Master Race--also enjoy the type of civilization you have just\nhad demonstrated for me?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. They are far too brutal, too morally degraded, to know anything\nof these finer points of etiquette and propriety. They are really an\nuncouth bunch. Why, do you know, I am certain that they would have had\nthe bad taste to use an energy weapon to dispose of the victim in a case\nsuch as you just witnessed! They are really quite unfit to rule. They\ncan scarcely be called civilized at all. But we will soon put a stop to\nall of that--your race and mine, of course.\"\n\n\"I sincerely hope so,\" said Crownwall.\n\n\n\nRefreshments were served to His Effulgence and to Crownwall during the\ntrip, without interrupting the smooth progress of the sedan. The\nsoldiers of the cohort, the bearers and Ggaran continued to run--without\nfood, drink or, except for Ggaran, evidence of fatigue.\n\nAfter several hours of travel, following Crownwall's directions, the\nprocession arrived at the copse in which he had concealed his small\ntransportation machine. The machine, for spatial mobility, was equipped\nwith the heavy and grossly inefficient anti-gravity field generator\ndeveloped by Kowalsky. It occupied ten times the space of the temporal\ntranslation and coordination selection systems combined, but it had the\ngreat advantage of being almost undetectable in use. It emitted no mass\nor radiation.\n\nAfter elaborate and lengthy farewells, Crownwall climbed into his\nmachine and fell gently up until he was out of the atmosphere, before\nstarting his enormous journey through time back to Earth. More quickly\nthan it had taken him to reach his ship from the palace of His\nEffulgence, he was in the Council Chamber of the Confederation\nGovernment of Earth, making a full report on his trip to Vega.\n\nWhen he had finished, the President sighed deeply. \"Well,\" he said, \"we\ngave you full plenipotentiary powers, so I suppose we'll have to stand\nbehind your agreements--especially in view of the fact that we'll\nundoubtedly be blown into atoms if we don't. But from what you say, I'd\nrather be in bed with a rattler than have a treaty with a Vegan. They\nsound ungodly murderous to me. There are too many holes in that\nprotection plan of yours. It's only a question of time before they'll\nfind some way around it, and then--poof--we'll all be dust.\"\n\n\"Things may not be as bad as they seem,\" answered Crownwall\ncomplacently. \"After I got back a few million years, I'm afraid I got a\nlittle careless and let my ship dip down into Vega III's atmosphere for\na while. I was back so far that the Vegans hadn't appeared yet. Now, I\ndidn't land--or _deliberately_ kill anything--but I'd be mighty\nsurprised if we didn't find a change or two. Before I came in here, I\nasked Marshall to take the ship out and check on things. He should be\nback with his report before long. Why don't we wait and see what he has\nto say?\"\n\n\n\nMarshall was excited when he was escorted into the Council Chamber. He\nbowed briefly to the President and began to speak rapidly.\n\n\"They're gone without trace--_all of them_!\" he cried. \"I went clear to\nSunda and there's no sign of intelligent life anywhere! We're all alone\nnow!\"\n\n\"There, you see?\" exclaimed Crownwall. \"Our enemies are all gone!\"\n\nHe looked around, glowing with victory, at the others at the table, then\nslowly quieted and sat down. He turned his head away from their accusing\neyes.\n\n\"Alone,\" he said, and unconsciously repeated Marshall's words: \"We're\nall alone now.\"\n\nIn silence, the others gathered their papers together and left the room,\nleaving Crownwall sitting at the table by himself. He shivered\ninvoluntarily, and then leaped to his feet to follow after them.\n\nLoneliness, he found, was something that he couldn't face alone.\n\n                                                    --L.
