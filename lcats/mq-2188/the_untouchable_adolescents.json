    "body": "The planet Diamore, hung round and gaudy in the view-plates. As\ncolorfully unchanging as it had been every day for the two weeks since\nthe _Wallower_ had plopped out of inverspace near it.\n\nCaptain Luther Shreve started violently as the whine of the\nStress-Potential banks died away. They had been a constant noisemaker\nduring the past two weeks; their continual dull rhythm had come to seem\ncompanionable. Now the keening discordancy was ended, and he knew they\nhad finished estimating the planet in the plates.\n\nHe sat very still, staring at the energy dials building their reserves\nback up. The banks had used much extra power.\n\nHe sat very still, waiting for them to bring him the plates. He didn't\nwant to see them. He was a full Captain in the Merchant Arm of the\nCommercial Navy, and he found the tough outer shell of himself that had\nformed during thirty years in that service suddenly disintegrating.\nHe was afraid of what those plates would say.\n\nThe tube glowed behind him and Teller--slightly overweight, slightly\nflorid, slightly balding and a brilliant Psych Officer--stepped off the\nplate, into the control room.\n\nTeller slumped onto the copilot's couch, extended the sheaf of plate\nreadings. Luther Shreve tipped his cap back on his head with a\npracticed thumb and shuffled the plates in silence.\n\nFrom time to time his pink tongue washed across his lips. Finally he\nsighed and rubbed weary fingers across the bridge of his nose. He\nclosed his eyes and slowly sank back against the cushions.\n\nWith eyes still closed, he voiced the final possibility. \"Any room for\nerror?\"\n\nHe had tried to keep the tenseness from his voice, but it somehow\ndoubled in the faintly resonating confines of the control room.\n\nTeller shook his head. \"They tell me no, Luther. I ran the plates up\nfor them, mainly because they were all afraid to be here when you saw\nthe sad news. You terrorize those poor backroom boys, Luther.\"\n\nTeller looked across, saw the odd set to Shreve's face, and realized\nhis jibes were annoying the other. He swung his short legs over the\nside of the couch with a thump, clasped his hands in his lap as though\nabout to recite.\n\n\"They have somewhere less than five months. Then the Big Push comes.\nThe eruptions will wipe out nine-tenths of the centers of community.\"\nHe leaned across and pulled one sheet from the stack Shreve held. \"Here\nis the position map.\" He indicated with quick, short jabs of his finger\nwhere the first earthquakes would hit, and followed blue lines to their\nterminuses.\n\nHe extended his hands, palms upward, in a movement of futility and\nsadness.\n\nShreve sat forward, sharply. He swept the cap from his head with one\nhand, ran the other through stringy, brown hair. He pursed his lips,\nmuttered, \"We've got to do something! It's more than just business\npotential ruined. There are people down there, Karl! Millions of them.\nWe can't let them die!\"\n\n\"True,\" Teller stated simply, looking at his clasped hands. \"But,\" he\nadded, \"what about the itinerary? They'll scream bloody blazes back\nthere if you break schedule.\" He cocked a thumb toward the rear of the\nship--toward Earth.\n\n\"Karl, I've been pushing one of these cans for MerchArm over thirty\nyears. I'll be thirty-one in August. I've never broken a schedule in my\nlife--but this is ... this is something more important than bills of\nlading and sales curves!\" His face had tightened, the character lines\nabout his mouth standing forth.\n\n\"We've got to save them, Karl. We've got to help those people down\nthere!\"\n\nTeller exhaled heavily. \"All right, Luther. It's your choice. But you'd\nbetter produce something from those natives down there, or MerchArm\nmight get unpleasant.\"\n\nShreve nodded, his face sagged into weariness momentarily. Then he\nstraightened and depressed the public-address stud on the couch arm.\nHis orders were brief and direct.\n\nAn hour later, ship-time, the great Wallower fired away with\ndirectional rockets, and began to fall toward the multi-colored sphere\nof Diamore.\n\n\n\nHigh jungle surrounded the ship. Deep-red stringers of climbing vine\nmeshed with the purple and green and blue of exotic tree-forms. From\nthe edge of the dead path the Wallower had burned in settling, the\npatchwork melange of colored growth reared and spread.\n\nThe analyzers were just completing their spore-counts when the\nDiamoraii burst from the jungle, thundered onto the charred ground of\nthe clearing.\n\nThey rode tall on the backs of their mounts, whooping and wailing in\na minor key. The outside receivers, which had been left on in various\nparts of the _Wallower_, rattled tinnily at the noise. Men clasped\nhands to their ears and hurried to depress studs to shut out the\ndin. Shreve and Teller whirled from their calculations and stared\nfascinated at the sight in the plates.\n\nThe Diamoraii's huge, loping animals closely resembled Terrestrial\ngiraffes. The beasts were pitch-black and ran with a gait beautifully\nadapted to the jungle. They came on with a liquid, side-stepping\nmotion. They neatly leaped the twisted tree-trunks, swayed out of the\npath to avoid a cluster of high-pile blossoms, and trampled to a stop\nfifty yards in front of the _Wallower_.\n\n\"Stations!\" Shreve yelled into the p-a mike. He turned back to the\nview-plate, staring at the black beasts.\n\nThere were twelve of them, each with a depression in its back in which\na Diamorai sat, clutching the flanks of the thin, black animal with\nhis knees. Twists of pliant material looped through the beast's noses\nserved both as bridle and reins.\n\nThe twelve Diamoraii leaped agilely from their mount's backs, began\nlooking at each other with indecision. They milled about the stomping\nanimals for a minute, then each went to a bulky pouch slung across his\nbeast's back-depression. They fumbled in the pouches.\n\nShreve turned the plates up to higher magnification, whistling through\nhis teeth. \"Wheeew! What magnificent creatures! Did you see the way\nthey ran that jungle like broken-field quarterbacks?\"\n\nFrom beside him the agreeing mutter of the pudgy psych officer blended\nwith the busy clicking of the analyzers, totaling their counts.\n\n\"Those look to be the people we have to contact, Karl,\" Shreve added,\nmotioning toward the Diamoraii who were dragging objects from their\npouches.\n\n\"A young people,\" Teller mused, his face flushed. \"A young and a virile\npeople. Shouldn't have any trouble getting through to them.\" He turned\na plate knob to sharper register.\n\nThe Diamoraii had advanced on the ship. They were almost humanoid.\nTall--almost six and a half feet each with very long legs and boney,\nknobbed knees. Their legs seemed to represent almost half their bodies.\nWide-shouldered, V-shaped chests; obviously large-lunged. Otherwise,\ndespite the wide-spaced, large-irised eyes, they were almost humanoid.\n\nAs Shreve and Teller watched, they each donned a hideous devil-mask.\n\n\n\n\"Ugh!\" Shreve blurted, his face drawing up into a picture of agony.\n\"What ghastly greeting cards _those_ are! If that's a sample of their\ndemonology, I'd hate to see them exorcising one of the poor devils:\nprobably frighten the thing to life!\"\n\nTeller was leaning closer to the screen, his small eyes watching the\ntwelve with undisguised fascination. He was talking more to himself\nthan his superior. \"Must be religious symbols of some sort. Must have\nput on their Prayer-day best just to come see us.\"\n\nShreve looked at Teller sharply. \"You don't suppose they think we're\ngods or something?\"\n\nShaking his head in annoyance, Teller replied, \"No, no, certainly not.\nYou can tell they don't! They haven't prostrated themselves or offered\nup sacrifices or such, as the typical superstitious aborigine would.\nNo, I'm quite certain they don't deify us. Probably just insuring that\nevil spirits don't try to interfere with their mission--whatever that\nmight be. But,\" he added, \"it doesn't appear to be dangerous, whatever\nit is.\"\n\nThe twelve were now capering and turning handsprings directly under the\nplate's hull-pickups. Shaking their masks into the cameras. They seemed\nunaware that anyone might be watching.\n\n\"Ritual,\" murmured Teller.\n\nAs though his identification of it had tired them of their actions,\nthey sat--almost as one. Cross-legged, arms akimbo, expressions\nstolidly hidden by the grotesque shapes of their devil-masks, they\nwaited. Again, almost to the second, they removed their hands from\ntheir hips and folded them across their massive chests.\n\nShreve looked at the tight semi-circle of aliens, then at Teller. He\nlicked his lips anxiously. It was apparent he was happier, now that he\nhad landed and felt he could help the Diamoraii.\n\n\"Well, what should we do, Karl? This is more in your line. Should we\ngo out and talk to them, or bring them inside? Do you think they're\naware of the coming eruptions?\" The questions had come out on top of\none another, with an almost childlike anxiety.\n\nIt was odd to hear such a tone from the otherwise stolid Shreve. Teller\nlooked up in surprise. He smiled slowly.\n\nThe psych officer flipped his plate off, turned, crossing his arms as\nthe aliens had done, and sat on the dead console.\n\n\"I don't think they know what's happening down there, Luther. At\nleast,\" he amended, \"they didn't appear to be preparing for evacuation\nin the threatened areas when we went over them. So I rather suspect\nthey're waiting for us to come out and chat.\" He shrugged his\nshoulders, staring at Shreve. \"And that, my Captain, is it.\"\n\nShreve looked back at the aliens in his plate. He nodded his head\nwith determination, and his face lit up with purpose. Teller had seen\nthe look once or twice before--never on routine commercial ventures,\nhowever. He had labeled it missionary zeal.\n\nThe Diamoraii were still sitting in cross-legged squats, their knees up\nabout their mask's pointed ears and horned temples.\n\n\"Well, then I suppose we'd better go out and chat. The sooner we set up\nthe Stress Rectifiers, the better.\" He got up, stepped toward the shaft.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said, stopping and turning back to the psych officer, \"I'd\nlike you to come out with me, Karl. No orders, you understand, but I'd\nappreciate it.\"\n\nThe short psychologist looked at him for a moment, nodded his head\nin acceptance. Shreve stepped into the shaft and sank down through\nthe floor as the tube glowed. Teller looked at the empty shaft for a\nmoment. As the platform slipped back into place he flipped Shreve's\nplate off.\n\nStepping onto the platform he threw a glance over his shoulder at the\nnow-grey plate.\n\n\"You're a very young race,\" he whispered, disappearing through the\nfloor.\n\n\n\nThey dropped the few inches to the ground, bouncing a bit more than\nthey'd allowed for, in the lessened gravity of Diamore. All around them\nthe screams of the jungle meshed into one primal roar.\n\nShreve ran his tongue around the inside of his cheek. The medic had\nflatly refused to allow their exit, unless they submitted to the six\nshots he felt were minimum safety precaution.\n\nWith the feel of the electro-syringe still in his cheeks, Shreve\nstepped away from the monstrous plug-port, raising his arms in\nfriendship. Behind him, Teller did the same.\n\nThey moved slowly toward the Diamoraii. The twelve sat immobile, yet\nseeming to be looking from each other to the Earthmen, and back, in\nsharp, jerking motions. It was all illusion, but disquieting.\n\nAs they stepped toward the aliens, Shreve felt the nerves in his\nteeth begin to twitch. He had been about to say something soothing in\nEnglish, but the words never came out.\n\n_Who are you?_\n\nThe question appeared in his head full-blown, inquisitive, without\nsense of direction or distance. He knew immediately from where it had\ncome, of course, yet he could not quite believe it. Shreve stopped\ndead, the pain in his jaws mounting. He glanced quickly at Teller.\n\nThe shorter man was clutching his jaws with both hands, biting his\nlower lip and rocking back and forth, eyes half-closed.\n\n\"Karl,\" Shreve's tongue stumbled over the words in his pain,\n\"they're--migod, Karl--they're _telepathic_!\"\n\nThey stood rooted in their tracks, staring at the twelve impassive\naliens in their grotesque masks.\n\nTeller stared in open fascination, still clutching his head. \"The\nfirst,\" he murmured in awe. \"The very first! They always said someday\nwe'd meet them, and now, by God, we have!\" His voice died off to a\nwhisper and he stared unblinking at the dark-skinned Diamoraii.\n\nThe words appeared in their minds once more--this time more firm,\ntinged with impatience:\n\n_Who are you?_\n\nShreve seemed unable to respond. He had thought them ignorant savages,\non the verge of disaster, who would be jubilant at the offer of aid.\nInstead, he was faced with making contact; contact with the first\nmind-reading race Humanity had met racing through the stars. His throat\ntightened up, he could not speak.\n\n\n\nFinally, he took a step forward, extended his hands in peace to the\naliens. \"Friends. We've come to help you. Friends.\"\n\nHe was certain they couldn't understand the spoken words. Whether or\nnot they could decipher the thoughts--that was something else. Later,\nthe Earthmen could bring out the communicators if the need arose. But\nfor now, he wanted only the soothing good will in his voice to win them.\n\nIf they knew the Earthmen were protected by stat-fields, and that a\ndozen gun-blisters were trained on them, they gave no indication.\n\n_We don't want your help._\n\nThere was a tone of anger, a driving odor of fear, in the feel of\nthe thoughts. The Earthmen felt their teeth jump as the thoughts\nmaterialized. Shreve realized suddenly that the toothaches must be a\nby-product of the psi power.\n\nShreve turned to Teller. The psych officer was staring back at him,\nhis eyes wide, his hands still clutching his jaw. They both recognized\nsomething they had missed when the telepathy first became known to them.\n\nIt was not an entering of the mind; they could not reach into the\ndeepest recesses of the Diamoraii's minds and get whole pictures. It\nwas like a mental radio transmission.\n\nThey could send and receive, with inflection and depth, but they had to\ndo it in darkness.\n\nTeller said nothing, but he stepped closer to the aliens. Shreve could\ntell he was thinking at them, but _what_ he was thinking was impossible\nto guess. If the aliens understood, they gave no indication. The\ntransmission did not work between the Earthmen, obviously.\n\nWhen Teller had fallen back, Shreve asked, \"What did you say?\"\n\n\"I told them we were here because volcanic eruptions were going to\nrip up their planet within five months. I told them the quakes and\nvolcanos would kill off ninety-five percent of their people. I told\nthem we could help them to--\"\n\nThe aliens rose slowly, and one stepped forward. He looked down at the\ntwo Earthmen.\n\n_Hear this you are not the first strangers to come here once before\nstrange men came to us from the sky they called themselves the Kyben\nand they told us they wanted to trade but they did not trade they ate\naway our land and burned our jungle and took our women and killed our\nyoung warriors._\n\nIt came as a blast of pure thought. All at once, as though spurted out\nwhole from the mind. The inflection was there--the meaning--the depth\nof bitterness. Shreve felt his mouth dry out at the calibre of agony in\nthe thoughts.\n\nTeller shrugged his shoulders as though he wanted no more part in the\nmatter, and retreated a few steps, massaging his throbbing jaws.\n\nThe alien stream ceased, and the Diamorai drew back. He seemed to rise\nup on his toes, as though he wanted to strike the Earthman, but was\nrestraining himself through the movement.\n\n\n\nShreve felt a desperation mounting in him. He _had_ to save these\npeople, _had_ to make them realize their danger. \"But you can read our\nminds--you can _see_ we're telling the truth!\" he argued. He found his\nstomach muscles had tightened, hands had clenched.\n\nThe alien thought reverberated in his head: _What makes you think you\ncannot lie with telepathy?_\n\nThen the thoughts flowed again. This time cold, dispassionate, merely\ninformation.\n\n_We have been as you think burned once and we do not wish to be burned\nagain we cannot say whether or not these things you warn us of really\nexist but we will take our own destinies in our hands and treat them if\nthey come we have seen no such indications of eruptions and we do not\nbelieve you._\n\nThe thoughts ceased. Then one word alone: _Go_.\n\nShreve cursed the limitations of the psi faculty. Of what use was\na mind-reading ability if it merely told you what another person\nthought--not whether it was true or not?\n\nHe stepped toward them again. He looked up at the fearsome masks and\nfelt the sinking of his stomach. He realized they were a young and\nheadstrong people, Teller had made that clear to him. Their arrogance\nwas the false front of a people frightened by the unknown. But were\nthey so young that they could not realize when they needed help?\n\n\"Look,\" he found himself speaking, \"you don't seem to understand.\" The\naliens moved back as Shreve approached. They didn't seem to want him\nnear them. \"Your planet is a young one. There are internal stresses\nthat are going to rip open your continents. We can set up machines that\nwill re-direct these eruptions--into the ocean, back in the jungle\nwhere it's uninhabited--so your people won't die. We--\"\n\n_Did you see the blood pits near the Great Ocean?_\n\nShreve caught the thought, and knew there was more to it than the\nDiamorai had thought at first. The thought was laden with blast-furnace\nhatred and a deadly bitterness.\n\nHe remembered the planet-circling landing the _Wallower_ had made.\nHe remembered the single body of water, the Great Ocean, stretching\nyellow and rippling across a third of Diamore. The picture completed\nitself in his mind and he saw the monstrous gouges ripped into the\nland, near the shore of that ocean. Pits of fused, crimson soil; bare,\ngaping wounds, nothing but emptiness and dead plants surrounding them\nfor miles.\n\n_Those are the ones_, the thought came. _Those were the cities of\nGolamoor, Nokrosch and Huyt on the shores of the Great Ocean we\nresisted the Kyben when they wanted to drill out our ceremonial grounds\nfor their soils they said were radioactive we would not let them drill\nand they sent down death to our cities._\n\nTinged with such emotion, the words were so boldly put, their meaning\nwas all too clear. These people would never reverse their decision.\nThey hated all outsiders. Shreve wondered whether they could be blamed.\n\n\"But you _need_ our help! You've got to believe me! You can read my\nthoughts--can't you see I'm telling the truth!\"\n\n_We could read the Kyben thoughts, too._\n\nSilence in their minds for an instant, then:\n\n_Have you seen the blood pits?_\n\n\n\nLuther Shreve felt as though he were being dragged down into a\nwhirlpool. He didn't know why it was suddenly so important to him that\nhe help the Diamoraii. There was certainly no sense of brotherhood with\nthe aliens. But he knew, on a level that defied all doubt, that he must\nsave these people, or never feel at peace with himself again.\n\nBehind him, Shreve heard Teller snort in disgust. The psych officer\ntook two quick steps forward, jerked his head toward the massive bulk\nof the _Wallower_. \"Children! That's all they are. They think those\nmasks protect them from evil, they think their blind arrogance will\nprotect them if trouble comes! They think they know better than us!\nThey don't know when they need help. Come on, Luther, leave them if\nthat's what they want!\" He turned to go, his face flushed in anger.\n\nShreve looked back at the aliens. He searched the blank and grotesque\nmasks for some evidence of willingness to reason. There was none.\nShreve gritted his teeth in frustration; he _wanted_ to help, he\n_wanted_ to save them--but they wouldn't _let_ themselves accept his\nhelp. The aliens didn't _want_ to be saved. They stood there, tall,\nimpassive, the thought radiating unendingly:\n\n_Go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go._\n\nLuther Shreve stepped toward them, anger boiling hot in his brain. \"All\nright, damn you! If you're too stupid, or too swollen up with your own\nimportance to realize you need help, we'll help you despite yourselves!\"\n\n_Why do you think the Kyben left Diamore?_\n\nShreve's words stopped before they could be spoken. His fury checked\nitself. He hadn't considered that. Why _had_ another race, one that\ncould decimate a planet as the blood pits indicated they could, leave\nwhen they seemed to be on the verge of getting what they wanted?\n\n_We are not defenseless we can stop you we will hurt you go._\n\nTeller's sharp laugh interrupted before Shreve could get an answer\nout. \"Fools! Pompous adolescents! What makes you think your primitive\nwarriors with their bogey masks can harm us? Look!\" He stepped toward\nthe alien. The Diamorai backed up. Teller stepped quickly, coming into\nsharp contact with the alien's body. The Diamorai leaped back, the\nshort hairs on his body standing straight out. He thought something at\nhis brothers. It was incomprehensible to the Earthmen.\n\n\"That's a stat-field. And there are a dozen guns pointed at you from\nthe ship. We'll set up the machines and save you whether you like it or\nnot.\" He turned away with a low chuckle, adding ruefully, \"Though why\nyou want to bother with such a bunch of arrogant children is beyond me,\nLuther.\" He walked toward the ship.\n\nCasting nervous glances at one another, the aliens leaped to the backs\nof their mounts, reined in and turned to leave. Shreve stood and\nwatched them as they loped to the jungle's edge.\n\nThe ebony giraffe-things drew up short, and the leader's reared up as\nthe alien turned to stare at Shreve.\n\n_Go or we will hurt you._\n\nIn an instant they were gone, melting into the colored riot of the\njungle, the beasts' hoofs beating ever more faintly as they moved away.\n\nShreve turned back to the ship. He should have felt no temperature\nchanges within his stat-field, yet somehow he had grown chilled in a\nfew seconds.\n\n\n\nNight had descended quickly, dropping like a sea of ink over Diamore.\nThe robomechs had set out the floodlamps, almost to the edges of the\njungle, and the _Wallower_ was bathed in white light, sharply outlining\nher plate construction, and the clean transparency of the conning\nbubbles.\n\nPaul Jukovsky, Roboexec, jg, stood behind his control console in the\nconstruction bubble, watching the thirty ton robomech carrying its\nburden. The sixteen-wheeled robomech rolled off the extended cargo\nhatch ramp, sinking just a bit into the springy ground of Diamore.\nJukovsky grinned at his foresight in spreading a primary hardener over\nthe surface before the big boys went to work.\n\nHe two-fingered a cigarette out of his lapel pocket, stifling a belch.\n\"Damn that cookie,\" he muttered. \"If he doesn't stop putting cayenne\nin the salad....\" He stuck the cigarette in his mouth, lipping it\nirritably for a second. He withdrew it, spitting out a loose bit of\ntobacco. Satisfied, he inserted it again, began to scratch it alight\nwith his fingertip.\n\nHe moved a calibrated knob on the board three clicks. The lumbering\nmonster outside revolved its head, the huge drilling plate it carried\non its flattened and magnetized top moving also. \"Like an old woman\ncarrying a water urn on her head,\" he chuckled, puffing the cigarette.\n\nThe robomech neared phosphorescent markings laid out on the ground,\nwhere the fibreglass base plate should be planted. Stress Rectifiers\nwould be magno-clamped to the base plate, then would begin their\nsearch-position-drilling.\n\nHe moved to press the release button that would cause the robomech to\nset its burden down lightly.\n\nPaul Jukovsky's teeth suddenly began to ache with terrible intensity.\nHe clutched at his face wildly, burning the palm of his hand on the\ncigarette.\n\nA strangled sob began to form, ended in a gurgling half-scream. His\neyes rolled upwards and a trickle of blood emerged from the corner of\nhis mouth.\n\nStone-dead he fell across the control console, depressing all studs.\n\nThe thirty ton robomech whirled twice and burst toward the edge of\nthe jungle. It struck the boles of three huge intertwined trees with\na resounding clang; the base plate bounced from its head and crashed,\nshattering, onto a projecting rock spear. The robot struggled for a\nmoment more, driving into the jungle, knocking trees from its path in\nblind fury.\n\nThe smell of cordite soaked through the clearing, and a wisp of smoke\nissued from the service box. An instant later its chambers fused their\nbaffles and the robomech exploded with a terrifying burst of heat,\nimpossible light, and the scream of ripping metal.\n\n\n\n\"His brains were fused,\" Teller said.\n\nThe psych officer looked Shreve directly in the eyes, trying to\nfind meaning in the captain's closed expression. Teller's face was\nunnaturally white, his usually drooping lips thinned to a black line.\n\"The autopsymen were shaking like loose bolts when they reported to me,\nLuther. They swore they'd never seen anything like it before. It was as\nif someone had taken that boy's brains in his red-hot hands and molded\nthem like clay.\"\n\nShreve's jaw muscles worked in a strange rhythm. His voice was cold and\ndetermined. \"We are going to get those Rectifiers set up. Better stay\nin your cabin, Karl; I've got to put men on it.\"\n\nWhen Teller had left, the odd stare he had cast still haunting Shreve,\nthe captain sank onto his couch. He pressed the p-a stud and crisped\nhis orders, naming men and leaving no room for argument.\n\nHe felt the tremors through the soles of his boots as the men began\nunchocking their mechs. His balled fist found its way into his mouth.\n\nHe was not aware his hand was bleeding till several minutes after the\nteeth had pierced the skin.\n\nAfter the sixth death--all of them with their brain-pans charred and\ntheir grey matter stuck together--Shreve broke down.\n\nHe threw a blanker over the shaft and sat there swearing. His body\nshook and heaved as he mumbled into his hands. In one stride he was off\nthe couch and had smashed his fist full into the reflecting metal of\nthe console face. It left a shallow dent, and he didn't seem to notice\nthe angry inflammation of his knuckles. Teller stood across the room,\nkeeping very still, shaking his head slowly, and thinking soft sounds.\n\nAfter a while Shreve stopped, and collapsed onto the couch, his face\nred and swollen. \"Sorry, Karl,\" he said.\n\n\"Why don't you try crying, it's easier on the metabolism,\" he suggested.\n\nShreve gave a bitter laugh, thin and short. \"Last time I cried I was\neating cream cheese and jelly sandwiches and didn't know where little\nbabies come from.\" Teller didn't smile. He knew Shreve was covering\nup. He had never seen the man break as he had today, and he knew the\nknowledge should go no further.\n\n\"But why? _Why?_\" Shreve pounded his fist into the yielding couch. \"We\ncame to help them, why won't they let us?\"\n\n\"Luther, Luther,\" Teller soothed him, sitting down beside him on the\ncouch, \"don't you see? They're adolescents. They don't know when to\ncall for help. They've been hurt, and with the single-minded purpose of\nthe immature they're bound not to let it happen again. You can't blame\nyourself for what's happened.\n\n\"You had no way of knowing about this power of theirs. Why don't we\nleave right now. If we lay on all power we can make the schedule still\npretty close.\"\n\nShreve stood up, flicked on the view-plates. He stared into them a\nmoment, seeing nothing but tangled jungle. He drew up a bit, laid his\nhands flat on the console. \"I've got to talk to them once more. To beg\nthem again.\"\n\n\n\n_We warned you_ came the cold, hard tones. _The group-mind is\ninfinitely stronger than our individual power now that you have seen\nour strength will you go?_\n\n\"I've come to beg you once more,\" Shreve pleaded, looking up at the\nmasked Diamoraii, astride their mounts. He had made certain all outside\npickup mikes were off. \"We only want to help you. Won't you let us\nre-direct the coming eruptions. Please!\" Shreve had plumbed the depths\nof his mind in an attempt to find reasons for sacrificing such efforts\nto save the Diamoraii. The only reasons he had found he had not been\nable to translate--yet there was a sense of identification with the\nlong-legged and stubborn aliens. _He wanted to save them!_\n\n\"Can't you read my thoughts?\" he said, projecting truth, projecting\nhonesty and sincerity. \"Can't you see I want to help you, help your\npeople?\"\n\nThey did not even bother answering. He knew their acquaintance with\nthe truth that men of other worlds had offered. To be defeated because\nthose who need your help had been spoiled by another race!\n\nThe bitterness, the hatred, the distrust, washed over him, as the\nDiamorai leaned across his beast's neck, thought one snarled word: _Go_.\n\nShreve felt the futility of everything he had done, suddenly caving in\non him. He looked up into the blank stares of the masked aliens, said\nslowly, \"We will hang above your atmosphere till you call us.\"\n\nHe walked back to the _Wallower_. The huge plug-port closed behind him.\nThe aliens sat astride their beasts, staring at the ship.\n\nTheir minor-key whoops of victory rang and bounced in the jungle's\ntreetops as they swung their mounts roughly, dug boney knees into their\nsides, and careened into the multi-colored vastness.\n\nThe Diamoraii had won again!\n\n\n\nThe _Wallower_ spun slowly in space, the eternal dust of the universe\nlapping at her ports. Below her, enveloped by clouds of steam, the\nplanet Diamore blasted and erupted and screamed and belched and tore\nitself apart.\n\nLuther Shreve sat before the control console, staring with almost\nhypnotized attention at the view-plates. He watched the world die.\n\nHis face was hard and unyielding. He had refused entrance even to\nTeller, barring everyone from the control room.\n\nAt every eruption, with each fissure that opened wide enough to be seen\nfrom that fantastic height, he felt a strange sinking in his heart. His\nthroat was dry, and there was an odd pressure behind his eyes.\n\nHe watched silently, every once in a while letting the thought _They\ndidn't know when to ask for help_ filter through his mind.\n\n\n\nThe Group of Deciders huddled in the blasted Council Hall. The\nfloor--what was left of the inlaid tiles--shivered and heaved. Beyond\nthe twisted lattices of the windows they could hear the mighty rending\nof the planet as it opened and swallowed all that stood.\n\nWithin an hour of the first eruptions, so quickly and with such fury\nthat there had been no time for preparation, almost three-fifths of\ntheir race had been decimated.\n\nThe cities Kes and Uykvabask and Laylor had gone under with roaring\nflames and the scraping of stone against flesh. The Great Ocean had\nexploded with a red-hot bubbling and roared onto the land, washing\neverything before it. The lava flows raced Eastward to the Ceremonial\nGrounds and Westward to the Hunting Preserve. Everywhere the ground\nopened without warning or reason, and life sank beneath the earth.\n\n_Wrong_, the Group of Deciders admitted in their last refuge. _We were\nwrong we have been foolish we have rejected our only salvation we must\nprepare the group-mind send our plea for aid into space speak to the\noutsiders ask them to help us._\n\nThey thought their instructions away from themselves, to their kin\nacross Diamore's blasted face. _Prepare! Join! Speak to the outsiders!_\n\nAnd when they had gathered together every last Diamorai, with more\ndying as they joined the chain, with the feel of agony radiating\nthrough the group-mind, the message weakly rose. Tentatively it probed\nat the inner surface of Diamore's atmosphere.\n\nThe power was, perhaps, insufficient to reach the spaceship.\nThree-fifths of the Diamoraii were lost to the group-mind.\n\nThe group-mind struggled, frantically beaming, in hopelessness trying\nto get through to the Earthmen who rode above them.\n\nThe men who rode above them--waiting for a signal from the Diamoraii.\n\n\n\nShreve turned away from the plates, flicking them off. \"I can't stand\nit, Karl! How senseless! Because one race dealt them unfairly, they\nclosed their eyes to help from anyone else.\"\n\nTeller crossed his legs as he sat on the couch. He did not appear to be\ndisturbed by the sight from below.\n\n\"Luther, you can't go on destroying yourself. You did everything you\ncould. You were as resourceful as any man could have been.\n\n\"Now you'd better get back to the schedule. We're over four and a\nhalf months due at our next landfall.\" He saw his words were having\nno effect. \"Look, Luther, I've been in this business almost as long\nas you. I've seen this time and again. When you come up against an\nadolescent race, that doesn't know when it's got something too big to\nhandle, there's nothing you can do but back off and let them handle it\nthemselves. If they don't get smart enough to know when to call the\nfireman--that's their agony. Not _yours_!\"\n\n\"What's the next stop on our itinerary?\" he asked the last almost\njauntily, consciously trying to take Shreve's mind off the cinder that\nspun below the _Wallower_. He rose and stretched, as though from a\nprofound sleep.\n\nFor a moment he stared in wonder. Then he stepped into the shaft and\nquietly left the control room.\n\nHe had never thought he'd see the day when Luther Shreve cried like a\nchild.\n\n\n                                THE END",
