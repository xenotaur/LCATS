MARY MAGDALENE\n\n\n   Mary Magdalene has looked out of her window,\n   High in her cottage at Horeham Road;\n   From her high window has Mary looked down,\n   And seen all the doings and sights of the town:\n   The boys look up as they pass her abode\u2014\n   The boys look up, but the girls look down.\n\n   Mary Magdalene has caught sight of the Preacher\u2014\n   The Preacher Who\u2019s come from the town in the west;\n   She hears Him preaching out there on the Green:\n   His words have troubled her heart\u2014she has seen\n   His face, and the sobs are all thick in her breast,\n   And her tears are the saltest that ever were seen.\n\n   From Horeham Road to Boreham Street\n   And High Horse Bridge where the waters meet\u2014\n   East or west, was there ever seen\n   Such a preaching, such a teaching for Mary Magdalene?\n\n   A boy calls up to her there at the window:\n   \u201cCome down, my sweet, for the night is here,\n   And the stars are dim in the mists above,\n   And the darkening field is the place for love\u2014\n   Come down, my lovely, come down, my dear,\n   And show me beauty and give me love.\u201d\n\n   But Mary Magdalene still stands at the window,\n   And the dusk is white on her tear-stained face,\n   For the Preacher has broken her heart, and it turns\n   To the Word that freezes, the Word that burns,\n   The Word that is Flesh in the market-place,\n   Where the Preacher\u2019s voice through the silence burns.\n\n   From Horeham Road to Boreham Street\n   And High Horse Bridge where the waters meet\u2014\n   East or west, was there ever seen\n   Such a turning, such a burning for Mary Magdalene?\n\n   Mary Magdalene has gone down to the Preacher\u2014\n   The strange Young Man from the western town:\n   With silk she is shining, with scent she is sweet,\n   Her eyes are like water, like flowers are her feet,\n   And when she has come to the Green she falls down\n   Before the Young Preacher and kisses His feet.\n\n   She kisses His feet and she cries out for pardon,\n   With tears and with kisses His feet are all wet;\n   The boys are all staring and no word is said,\n   For she wipes His wet feet with the hair of her head\u2014\n   Her lovely brown hair that no boy can forget,\n   It is like a brown beech-wood, the hair of her head.\n\n   From Horeham Road to Boreham Street\n   And High Horse Bridge where the waters meet\u2014\n   East or west, was there ever seen\n   Such a sighing, such a crying for Mary Magdalene?\n\n   And the Preacher has stooped, and has blessed her and raised her,\n   And the boys are all laughing to see them stand so:\n   \u201cAh, lovely, and have you forgotten so soon\n   The ways of a woman, the ways of the moon,\n   And all the gay gallants with whom you would go\n   And show them the madness that\u2019s under the moon?\u201d\n\n   The Preacher has brought Magdalene to His mother,\n   And His mother has given her a white gown to wear,\n   And they\u2019ve sat down to supper together all three,\n   And the boys stand outside in the street and agree\n   That the joke\u2019s gone too far\u2014\u201cCome out, Mary, my dear,\n   For you and these strangers will never agree.\u201d\n\n   But Mary Magdalene has looked out of the window\u2014\n   She stands in the window all white and alone\u2014\n   \u201cI will never return while the stars are above\n   To the ways that were far from the true ways of love.\n   Oh, many a lover poor Mary has known,\n   But never till now has she learned to know love.\u201d\n\n   From Horeham Road to Boreham Street\n   And High Horse Bridge where the waters meet\u2014\n   East or west, was there ever seen\n   Such a story, such a glory for Mary Magdalene?\n\n\n\n\n                              ST. MATTHEW\n\n\n    Matthew the Publican sits at the gate of September,\n    Counting the gold of the passing and vanishing year\u2014\n    The gold that the Summer must pay with her tears and sighings\u2014\n            The gold of the falling leaves.\n\n    The Lord goes by and, turning, says unto Matthew:\n    \u201cFollow Me\u2014follow Me down the long months into Winter,\n    \u201cFollow Me\u2014follow Me down through the fogs of November,\n    \u201cWhen the coin of the year is spent and the trees are beggared,\n    \u201cWith never a golden leaf to drop at the gate\u2014\n            \u201cFollow Me.\u201d\n\n    Matthew the Publican rises to follow his Lord;\n    But first he will make a feast at the gate of September\u2014\n    He will make a feast for the sinners and Saints of the year.\n    The way is long and the Autumn paths are dreary,\n    So before he treads the dark road into the rain\n    He makes a great golden feast, the last feast of Summer,\n    And he throws his golden treasury over the fields.\n    The dying, fluttering, shimmering leaves of September,\n    The last of the daisies and coltsfoot and dandelions,\n    Are Matthew the Publican\u2019s treasure, his gold and silver,\n    Which he throws at his Master\u2019s feet, the feet he must follow\n    Down, down the Autumn, into the fogs\u2014\n            To the end of the year.\n\n\n\n\n                           THE ASCENSION DAY\n\n\n               So Thou hast left us and our meadows,\n               Lord, Who hast blessed us and our meadows\u2014\n               Lord of the sorrel-hearted hay,\n               Lord of the pollened flowers of May.\n               From our fields Thou hast ascended,\n               Passing into the anthered light\n               Beyond the sun, by the winds attended\u2014\n               And the Sussex fields are white\n               With daisies, and the diadem\n               Of the hawthorn crowns the hedge,\n               And at the blue pond\u2019s reedy edge,\n               Like a broidered, silken hem\n               The yellow irises are blown.\n               Lord, Thou art gone, and gone alone.\n\n               Dost Thou think of us and our meadows,\n               Lord, Who hast left us and our meadows?\n               In shining pastures of the sky\n               Thou walkest, Lord, ascended high.\n               The stars are flowers about Thy feet,\n               And looking up to Thee we see\n               The River flowing silently\u2014\n               The Milky River, broad and sweet\n               As Rother River here below,\n               While planets the dim marshes strow,\n               And constellations flower and fade....\n               O Lord, Thou hast Thy country there,\n               The fields and meadows of the sky,\n               The fields and meadows ever fair,\n               The dear, divine, undying glade.\n               At night we too walk in Thy meadows,\n               We walk beside Thee in Thy meadows.\n               At midnight I may hear Thy call,\n               And ride to Thee on the moon\u2019s light\u2014\n               To where the living waters fall,\n               And the unfading fields are bright.\n               The stars are flowers about our feet,\n               And at my side Thou art the sweet\n               Perfumed, eternal Breath of May....\n\n               With a sob the pale-eyed day\n               Wakens at the Rother\u2019s mouth,\n               And back to earthly fields I go,\n               And back to earthly toil, and slow\n               Hot days of the slow, drawling South,\n               Toiling to keep the fields alive,\n               For our poor meadows cannot thrive\n               On just the memory of Thy feet,\n               Which trod them once and found them sweet.\n               Our tears, our sweat, must give them life,\n               For Thou, our Lord, hast gone on high\n               To golden countries of the sky,\n               To golden fields of golden stars,\n               Beyond the echo of our strife....\n               Yet there, upon the shining hill,\n               Thou dreamest of our meadows still,\n               And, Lord, we have Thy promise plain\n               That Thou wilt walk in them again.\n\n\n\n\n                               PENTECOST\n                             _Veni Creator_\n\n\n                Dear Heart of the Eternal Rose\u2014\n                  O many-coloured Heart of Fire\u2014\n                That in our
