THE HOUSE OF SLEEP\n\n\n\n  It is a house with many doors,\n  no two alike.\n\n  I am at home in all its rooms\n  of time and place.\n\n  My changing person, gender, speech\n  hold no surprise.\n\n  I know who I am in my sleep,\n  behind my face.\n\n  If you ask which of them is false\n  and which is true\n\n  Enter the house with me and call,\n  I'll answer you.\n\n\n\n\n  Here inside the darkness,\n  the eye of light opens\n\n  As mind travels inward\n  to a fourth dimension.\n\n  There is no perspective\n  of other or outside.\n\n  Both obverse and reverse\n  are simultaneous\n\n  While past and present form\n  a folding wave that flows\n\n  Now backward, then forward\n  in one eternal dream.\n\n\n\n\n  I found it as a child,\n  a house that was all mine\n\n  Where I could think and be\n  whatever I believed.\n\n  Half of me stayed outside\n  on guard, aware of spies\n\n  The inner self went free\n  to wonder as it pleased.\n\n  Leaving the day behind,\n  I came upon the night\n\n  And there I dreamed of things\n  past all imagining.\n\n\n\n\n  Memory is no stranger\n  in the house of sleep.\n\n  It comes as a visitor\n  for a reunion.\n\n  If a private occasion,\n  with the family\n\n  Or else with those forgotten\n  who have long been gone.\n\n  The waiting house is ready\n  for us to gather.\n\n  Together or separately\n  our memories meet.\n\n\n\n\n  Waking in the night,\n  I have wondered where I am\n\n  Knowing I have been away\n  and not yet returned.\n\n  I lie still and wait\n  between absence and presence\n\n  Conscious of being witness\n  to my sleep and wake.\n\n  Here's body, inert,\n  prepared to revert to clay.\n\n  O wanderer with my lamp,\n  how dim grows the light.\n\n\n\n\n  Flying effortlessly\n  I escape gravity\n\n  And seaborne, breathe through gills\n  to swim past coral isles\n\n  Where I emerge on shores\n  that climb up ancient roads.\n\n  Always, my origins\n  enact some past within\n\n  Recalling elements\n  of former existence.\n\n  Save two, that I renounce:\n  bloodrust fire, fleshtorn ground.\n\n\n\n\n  Here I need no clock\n  to tell me what time it is.\n\n  The day, season, year\n  conform to no calendar.\n\n  No compass or map\n  points my route or direction.\n\n  Sensation is all:\n  the shape and sound of feeling.\n\n  I learn what I think\n  by choice of symbols, meanings.\n\n  I invent my world\n  as much as it invents me.\n\n\n\n\n  A baton like a pendulum\n  swings back and forth.\n\n  Across the universe it moves\n  in perfect time\n\n  Leading an orchestra of stars\n  through measured space.\n\n  A score arranged with such grandeur,\n  I merely hear\n\n  Its echoes through the walls of sleep--\n  how faint, how far\n\n  While my heart beats to the rhythm\n  of earth's passage.\n\n\n\n\n  The twelve hours of the night\n  are paths between the stars.\n\n  Whichever one you take\n  leads to this centered house\n\n  If you speak the password\n  to those who guard the gates.\n\n  You must not look at them\n  or touch them on the way\n\n  Lest you be left alone\n  and hear the triple bark.\n\n  For the rest, safe journey\n  and sweet dreams until dawn.\n\n\n\n\n  How the bedtime refrain still echoes\n  through the house:\n\n  \"Good night, sweet dreams, see you tomorrow.\"\n  Was it wish\n\n  Or something more substantial for child\n  to sleep on\n\n  Like a pillow filled throughout the night\n  with promise?\n\n  Which was kept and shall be kept in years\n  yet to come\n\n  When all the yesterdays that made me,\n  wake at dawn.\n\n\n\n\n  In genesis the dream began\n  and came to life\n\n  By dividing the form from void,\n  the dark from light\n\n  And parting the sea from dry land,\n  mother from child\n\n  Gave image its own reflection\n  by day and night\n\n  But kept the sleeping and waking\n  for seem and like\n\n  That the timeless and undying\n  remain in-sight.\n\n\n\n\n  Our dreamscape is a Mil Cumbres\n  across the years.\n\n  Peak after peak they rise like crests\n  above a sea\n\n  In which we plunge, swim, dive and drown\n  beneath each wave.\n\n  Yet breath returns and eyes grow clear\n  from time to time\n\n  As all stands still, becalmed, at rest,\n  and we can see\n\n  There, where we were.  Here, where we are.\n  How far.  Which way.\n\n\n\n\n  It was a garden of people\n  at all seasons.\n\n  I saw hands at work everywhere,\n  none of them still.\n\n  Some were planting new souls\n  in the fresh earth.\n\n  Others went about the weeding,\n  pruning, hoeing\n\n  Their baskets filled with human plants\n  of every kind.\n\n  While leaves, endless leaves kept falling\n  all around me.\n\n\n\n\n  Among the Joshua trees,\n  I saw a stone cross\n\n  Both claiming world salvation\n  from brush, sand and thorn\n\n  While I stood on a mountain,\n  waiting for the ark\n\n  To save me from destruction,\n  drowned by floods of sun.\n\n  But the fiery waves rose up\n  forty days and nights\n\n  And there was not a sign of\n  clouds, and no dove came.\n\n\n\n\n  A bird stopped me\n  as I started to walk across.\n\n  \"You can not enter the circle,\n  you have no wings.\"\n\n  So I went back\n  and I looked for them on the earth.\n\n  But none of all the winged insects\n  knew where mine were.\n\n  So I went on\n  and I looked for them in the sea.\n\n  And the fish told me of angels\n  who looked like birds.\n\n\n\n\n  With this ring I thee wed,\n  said the moon, said the earth.\n\n  I saw it overhead,\n  a crystal band of ice\n\n  Through which the eye of God\n  bore witness once again\n\n  To living light and love\n  within the cosmic void.\n\n  I heard the vows exchanged\n  between the cold and dark\n\n  Then with my own, warm breath\n  I wed the night and slept.\n\n\n\n\n  Through the mirror and through the fog,\n  all things reverse.\n\n  I see the right side on the left,\n  the left side, right.\n\n  I see the shapes of what has been\n  behind, transposed.\n\n  A camera floats above my head\n  as dreams submerge.\n\n  A shadow moves beyond my feet\n  in backward stride.\n\n  The mirror and the fog are one,\n  and I, enclosed.\n\n\n\n\n  What was the Eskimo\n  doing in the tropics?\n\n  What was the Hottentot\n  doing in the arctic?\n\n  Caught between the two,\n  I asked what choice was mine?\n\n  Having to freeze or burn,\n  I felt, was too extreme.\n\n  Yet heart elected south\n  and brain elected north\n\n  Since a temperate zone\n  in heaven was no more.\n\n\n\n\n  I wanted to lift\n  the poor and ignorant soul\n\n  To feed and clothe it,\n  to give it eyes and ears.\n\n  I led it away\n  from hunger, cold and terror\n\n  Helping it to climb,\n  to trust my choice of freedom.\n\n  But when I let go,\n  the peak opened with wide jaws\n\n  For the slip, the fall--\n  and I grabbed the soul, and ran.\n\n\n\n\n  What shall I be,\n  I asked of Tarot cards and stars\n\n  That I might live\n  as fits my tastes, beliefs and cares?\n\n  First, be a prince,\n  with pleasures, treasures, all desires.\n\n  Then, be a priest,\n  with holy thoughts of love divine.\n\n  Third, a peasant,\n  with simple needs and natural ways.\n\n  Last, as poet,\n  combine the three--or curse your fate.\n\n\n\n\n  It looked like a mountain\n  with garden terraces\n\n  A holiday setting\n  and dazzling in sunshine\n\n  Where one could be at ease\n  to stroll and meet old friends\n\n  Exploring all the paths\n  unhurried by the years\n\n  Feeling the light within\n  increase with heightened joy\n\n  While going up and on\n  from terrace to terrace.\n\n\n\n\n  I went down\n  into the vaults of time's library\n\n  Down through sunless, airless corridors\n  staffed by ghosts.\n\n  Down the winding halls and cobbled stairs\n  daubed with earth\n\n  Past the rows\n  of book graves in a cemetery\n\n  Of old words,\n  until I came to the last, first one\n\n  When I heard a rumble, saw a flash\n  and woke dumb.\n\n\n\n\n  I followed God\n  until he stopped at a crossroads.\n\n  On the one side\n  was a cliff high above the sea.\n\n  On the other,\n  a dense woods baited with summer.\n\n  Future unknown,\n  I asked which way was I to go?\n\n  He pointed left,\n  where the sun bowed low in the west.\n\n  And God, I asked?\n  To the right, he said and vanished.\n\n\n\n\n  It was a long road through a fog\n  that swirled like clouds\n\n  And many were going with me,\n  behind, ahead\n\n  Though no one spoke or stopped, moved past\n  or turned aside.\n\n  But when we reached the edge of time,\n  I grew afraid\n\n  Until one found me there and smiled\n  and took my hand\n\n  Then led me step by step again,\n  a little child.\n\n\n\n\n  First, the night came to me\n  in the shape of a moth.\n\n  With a soft flick like breath,\n  its wing-tips grazed my head.\n\n  Then, from a hollow tree,\n  a hoot owl mourned its cry\n\n  And as I turned to look,\n  I thought the moon turned, too.\n\n  Beyond the road, a skunk.\n  Within my room, a rose.\n\n  So I sat up, I think,\n  while the night spoke and spoke.\n\n\n\n\n  I hear the word incessantly\n  as a chorus\n\n  A word whose voices are composed\n  of all my years\n\n  Like a requiem long rehearsed\n  in every key\n\n  And begun the day of my birth,\n  inside of me\n\n  A word sung for my soul's repose\n  while I am here\n\n  An earthling, bent on a journey\n  still amorphous.\n\n\n\n\n  How to find the way back\n  by subway, streetcar, bus...\n\n  Can a hill disappear\n  or the stream in a park?\n\n  The morning's scent of rolls,\n  the sound of skates at dusk\n\n  Laundry roofs, coalbin chutes,\n  wagons, carts, iron stoops...\n\n  Like footprints in the snow,\n  the memories fall and drift.\n\n  I walk, I look, I ask,\n  a shadow in the past.\n\n\n\n\n  I ran to say goodbye\n  to the last railway train\n\n  Whose old, musty freight cars\n  were creaking at the joints.\n\n  In it, tons of paper,\n  unpublished manuscripts\n\n  Heading for the graveyard\n  like passengers turned ghosts.\n\n  At the rear, an organ,\n  installed in the caboose\n\n  Began the slow, slow march,\n  while the wind mourned and blew.\n\n\n\n\n  O most blessed and damned of women,\n  so greatly loved!\n\n  I know by my dreams that your own\n  have never died.\n\n  Before there was Egypt or Troy,\n  you were a slave.\n\n  Before Tristram or Abelard,\n  your face was pale.\n\n  While poets made heaven and hell\n  to prove your charms\n\n  Your passion, beauty, grief and joy\n  slept in my arms.\n\n\n\n\n  With all that space to explore,\n  how could I resist?\n\n  Finding my own place out there,\n  the wonder of it!\n\n  A stretched canvas came in view,\n  linen, framed in gold\n\n  With a palette never used,\n  meant for me alone.\n\n  I dipped my brush and painted\n  the place I loved best\n\n  Then forever set my claim:\n  north, south, east and west.\n\n\n\n\n  I had to go on and on,\n  the search was not done.\n\n  Winding corridors,\n  walls leading from door to door.\n\n  Mice, lions, sheep, chickens, frogs,\n  unassorted odds.\n\n  Nothing suited--quite--\n  despite the resemblances.\n\n  I heard voices, laughter, groans,\n  sounds foreign to mine.\n\n  Mirrors, symbols, signs...\n  twice, I almost found myself.\n\n\n\n\n  The room was full of eyes,\n  whichever way I looked.\n\n  Over walls, ceiling, floor,\n  they darted back and forth\n\n  Their eyelash hands and feet\n  mocking me and my book.\n\n  \"You can not get away,\n  I've told you that before.\"\n\n  Daddy longlegs reaching,\n  still haunting, still speaking.\n\n  \"A spider ghost, you say?\n  The harvest comes, daughter.\"\n\n\n\n\n  They tossed the pillow\n  from one hand to the other.\n\n  With roars of laughter,\n  it zipped, it flew, was caught and thrown.\n\n  My seams ripped open,\n  scattering my heart outside.\n\n  Slowly, painfully,\n  I gathered it together\n\n  And lay down to sleep,\n  clutching my life, my pillow.\n\n  Feathers of dead birds,\n  sterile echoes of lost flights.\n\n\n\n\n  A bill collector appeared,\n  flourishing old bills.\n\n  \"Your father gone, and mother,\n  who will pay for these?\"\n\n  I turned to the telephone,\n  one disconnected.\n\n  I looked inside the mailbox,\n  full of dead letters.\n\n  I searched through files and desk drawers,\n  all bankbooks cancelled.\n\n  Only one thing left to do--\n  to wake, and escape.\n\n\n\n\n  It was a lettuce morning,\n  crisp in pale sunlight.\n\n  By noon it was canary,\n  cat's eye and corn grain.\n\n  As shadows crept through the hills,\n  the sea turned bilious.\n\n  Dusk spilled a goodbye tunnel\n  down a shifting sky.\n\n  Then driftwood, fuming the air\n  with its smoke and cough.\n\n  After night crashed, we picked up\n  plans for tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n  When will the words be opened\n  and the book unsealed?\n\n  Not till the time of the end\n  of empires and beasts.\n\n  Then will the dream be written\n  according to men?\n\n  Not till the signs and vision\n  have become as one.\n\n  How shall we learn to know them\n  as true evidence?\n\n  Not till all human senses\n  merge with light again.\n\n\n\n\n  They were gone for days,\n  the hunters and fishermen\n\n  Challenging the beasts\n  who claimed the land and the sea.\n\n  The young sang their praise\n  all through the gloried summer\n\n  While the women danced\n  and gave them welcoming feasts.\n\n  How their deeds warmed us\n  winter nights! how bright the blaze!\n\n  Now, we are fearful\n  and cold.  We need more old men.\n\n\n\n\n  I turned back\n  the thick, heavy calendar of years\n\n  Laboring,\n  page by century by page of scroll\n\n  To restore\n  the undiscovered new world once more\n\n  Hoping to\n  reverse the winds and tides, west to east\n\n  To exchange\n  the ships, the crews, the conquests and all.\n\n  But gained what\n  by throwing Columbus overboard?\n\n\n\n\n  Shakespeare and Cervantes\n  died the same day and year.\n\n  So too Diogenes\n  and Great Alexander\n\n  Although each said farewell\n  in places far apart.\n\n  What extinguished both flames\n  at one instant of time?\n\n  A whirlwind in the night\n  or a merciful rain?\n\n  May a storm at my death\n  help me find my partner.\n\n\n\n\n  All of us who saw it from the ground\n  testified\n\n  It was the tortoise that fell and killed\n  Aeschylus.\n\n  So Christ, Socrates, Galileo\n  were killed, too.\n\n  We, the groundlings who witnessed their deaths,\n  swear to you\n\n  It was the tortoise each time.  It fell\n  from the air.\n\n  Some say eagles, by letting them fall.\n  But who knows?\n\n\n\n\n  I watched his clay flesh\n  take its changing form from thought\n\n  And fling the fiction\n  of his birth-by-chance to scorn.\n\n  Science, he would say,\n  is another way of life...\n\n  Without a flutter\n  or doubt to betray his eyes.\n\n  Such utter belief,\n  I found it hard to resist\n\n  Suspending my own--\n  he holds his world with such ease.\n\n\n\n\n  Then she who had been my wise teacher\n  in the past\n\n  Came and stood at the foot of my bed,\n  calling, \"Child...\n\n  I have come to say goodbye to you\n  at long last\n\n  For I join The Great Intelligence\n  this same night\n\n  There, where the substance of all shadows\n  is pure light...\"\n\n  Which vanished, as I wept in the dark,\n  blind and wild.\n\n\n\n\n  Not too much light left,\n  I collect the candle's tears.\n\n  Prodigal before\n  of the sun and its seasons\n\n  Now I search the night\n  for glowworms or gleams of snow.\n\n  Asleep open-eyed,\n  I turn my wax world slowly\n\n  Around a lifetime\n  of continents and oceans\n\n  Till the last star shrinks,\n  then shudders, and then goes out.\n\n\n\n\n  I saw it emptied\n  room by room and piece by piece\n\n  Until the house stood vacant\n  of all but its bones.\n\n  No paintings, no books,\n  no flowers, fruits or music.\n\n  A silence anonymous\n  as space void of time.\n\n  \"Wait,\" my body cried,\n  \"do not board up the windows!\n\n  \"The owner left a message:\n  she's coming home soon.\"\n\n\n\n\n  Because I longed\n  to comprehend the infinite\n\n  I drew a line\n  between the known and unknown\n\n  From zero base\n  to its apex point opposite\n\n  Thus dividing\n  all past time from all future time\n\n  And all of space,\n  the positive from negative.\n\n  Where both sides met,\n  they formed the infinite present.\n\n\n\n\n  I saw the church bend its steeples,\n  ears to the ground\n\n  Then place its pulpit on the roof\n  to speak to God\n\n  Proclaiming the kingdom of men\n  at last had come\n\n  Who gave each day its daily bread,\n  whose will was done\n\n  That none be tempted to trespass\n  or do evil\n\n  Seeing the power and glory\n  on earth, fulfilled.\n\n\n\n\n  I am not one.\n  Among the many I am part.\n\n  I do not know\n  how many or who, where they are.\n\n  Each has a name,\n  a face, an age--none of them mine.\n\n  Yet are we all\n  cells of the selfsame root in time.\n\n  No closer ties\n  bind us to those we call our own.\n\n  For we are one,\n  living each other's lives, unknown.\n\n\n\n\n  The sign said City of Dogs\n  and I went inside.\n\n  The streets, laid out as kennels,\n  were strangely quiet.\n\n  Posted German Shepherd guards\n  merely curled their lips\n\n  And growled as I passed by them\n  into the main office.\n\n  The huge picture startled me.\n  Nothing else was there.\n\n  Only Big Brother, the Chief,\n  who looked down and stared.\n\n\n\n\n  Why, with so much obsidian,\n  coal, pitch and tar\n\n  Was it so hard, I ask of God,\n  to make black black\n\n  Or, given milk, snow, lilies, pearls,\n  to make white white?\n\n  Yet nowhere is there creature found\n  to have black bones\n\n  Or, among the many species,\n  one with white blood.\n\n  I could question other colors:\n  yellow, red, brown?\n\n\n\n\n  I see them,\n  a standing army six million strong.\n\n  They are armed\n  with the weapons of our memory.\n\n  On all fronts,\n  they keep watch, to warn and remind us.\n\n  At our call,\n  they rise from the graveyard of our minds\n\n  And advance,\n  immune to hunger, guns, barbed wire, gas...\n\n  Their mission:\n  to rescue time from its own worst foe.\n\n\n\n\n  I know them, the assassins,\n  by the way they breathe\n\n  As they slip behind the wheel\n  to strangle the road\n\n  As they dive-bomb through the air\n  to explode the night.\n\n  I hear the changing rhythms\n  of their pulse, speech, steps\n\n  As they finger the trigger,\n  as they grasp the knife.\n\n  I clock the surge of passions\n  in their race with death.\n\n\n\n\n  Outside the house\n  were beggars, thugs, maniacs, thieves.\n\n  An alien world\n  as perceived through curtained windows.\n\n  Seen from afar,\n  the fires, riots, car wrecks, brawls\n\n  Made me recoil\n  and threatened the night while I slept.\n\n  Nor found I joy\n  in revels, circuses and feats\n\n  My skin thin, too,\n  for the rocks, the drums, the stampedes.\n\n\n\n\n  They came marching by the billions,\n  armies of ants.\n\n  From woods and fields, on roads and streets,\n  through walls, roofs, stairs\n\n  An all-out attack on V-Day,\n  V versus man.\n\n  Fire ants, flyers, drivers, cutters\n  for ground, sea, air.\n\n  Overrunning, overcoming,\n  world-wide, as planned.\n\n  Timed to the hour and minute,\n  none of us spared.\n\n\n\n\n  I spoke to God and Devil,\n  waiting for reply.\n\n  I whispered into both ears,\n  having seen two sides.\n\n  I told of men and women,\n  of youth and of age\n\n  Of joy, love, goodness, beauty,\n  and their counterface.\n\n  Each question and emotion\n  met with silent dread.\n\n  One listened to the living\n  and one, to the dead.\n\n\n\n\n  Butterfly wings, a pair of lungs,\n  a bivalve shell.\n\n  I see the M and W\n  traced on my palms.\n\n  Maple keys, antlers, feathers, ferns,\n  the tails of fish.\n\n  The one design repeats itself\n  in endless halves.\n\n  Mountain to valley, spring to fall,\n  high tide to low.\n\n  We are each other's counterpart,\n  together, whole.\n\n\n\n\n  Map in hand,\n  I studied the surfaces and depths\n\n  Of the land\n  assigned to me for exploration.\n\n  Flesh engraved,\n  the contours clearly showed the main routes\n\n  Time had paved\n  for me to follow by sun and stars.\n\n  Whether eyes\n  misread the signs or feet betrayed me\n\n  All the skies\n  my palms enclosed led far out to sea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  THE SAILOR'S STORY\n\n  1\n\n  Evenings on cobbled streets\n  leading down to the wharves\n\n  Where boys matched oars with men,\n  straining pride and muscle\n\n  Their boats nosing the wind\n  to catch the next tide's run.\n\n  But it was not fish food\n  I hungered for, or proof\n\n  As I walked back each time,\n  the youngest son of five\n\n  With alien eyes and thoughts\n  reaching out to starboard.\n\n\n\n\n  2\n\n  There was no goodbye\n  that last night, no righteous words.\n\n  I left silently\n  with no one to look at me\n\n  But my own shadow,\n  the wind lifting my footsteps\n\n  Down stone passageways,\n  lantern, pack and gear in hand.\n\n  Until, there it was,\n  riding at anchor, far out.\n\n  I paused a moment\n  and then ran, homeless, from home.\n\n\n\n\n  3\n\n  Always a convoy\n  for the long sea voyages\n\n  The ship like a whale\n  or a shark with pilot fish\n\n  The hills receding\n  as our masts climbed up the sky\n\n  And I knew it would be weeks\n  before we returned\n\n  Though we had strong sails, good winds\n  and plenty of hands.\n\n  Yet I never can recall\n  the last trip of all.\n\n\n\n\n  4\n\n  I remember the islands\n  flashing in the sun\n\n  Mostly barren rocks\n  and slopes of tattered vineyards\n\n  The waterfronts deserted\n  except by seabirds\n\n  No one to trade with\n  and our vessel filled with jars.\n\n  So we headed past the coast\n  toward open ocean\n\n  Where strange crews hailed us,\n  and for honey, gave us salt.\n\n\n\n\n  5\n\n  Then came fever\n  and all the sick were put ashore.\n\n  We had good care:\n  warm milk, vinegar baths and beds.\n\n  When my head cleared,\n  there was a road along the cliffs\n\n  Which I followed\n  past the village behind the goats\n\n  Feeling the ground\n  steady and true for a good house.\n\n  Until sunset,\n  when I saw the sea flowing west.\n\n\n\n\n  6\n\n  So I left that past\n  and shipped into the future\n\n  A boy born on land\n  with sea legs, a strange

She is\nnot to be confused with the British poet (1924-2008) of the same\nname. For more detailed information about her life, work, and\ncritical commendations, see the Wikipedia article\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Bartlett_%28American_poet%29.\n\nBartlett's most notable achievements include:\n\n* Creation of a new form of poetry, \"the twelve-tone poem,\"\nadapting Arnold Schoenberg's musical system to the verbal, accented\nsounds of language. Called \"the Emily Dickinson of the 20th\nCentury,\" her concise lyrics have been praised by poets, musicians,\nand composers alike.\n\n* Publication of 16 books of poetry, a group of edited anthologies,\nand more than 1,000 poems, short stories, and essays published, for\nexample, in _Harper's_, _Virginia Quarterly_, _New York Times_,\n_North American Review_, _Saturday Review_, _Prairie Schooner_,\nand in numerous international collections.\n\n* Recipient of many fellowships, grants and awards, including NEA,\nPEN Syndicate, fellowships at the Huntington Hartford Foundation,\nMontalvo, Yaddo, MacDowell, Dorland Mt. Colony and Ragdale, travel\ngrants, and honors for introducing literature as part of the\nOlympics.\n\n* Founder of the Literary Olympics, to restore literature,\nspecifically poetry, as a vital part of the Olympics as it once\nhad been in ancient Greece.\n\nBartlett's poetry came to the attention of leading poets, writers,\nand critics as diverse as Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, Mark\nVan Doren, Conrad Aiken, Allen Tate, Alfred Kreymborg, Robert\nHillyer, Louis Untermeyer, Rolfe Humphries, John Ciardi, Richard\nEberhart, Richard Wilbur, Maxine Kumin, Robert M. Hutchins,\nKenneth Rexroth, William Stafford, and others. Over the years,\nBartlett maintained an active and extensive correspondence with\neminent poets, writers, and literary critics; evident throughout\nthis collected literary correspondence are strong statements\nattesting to the importance of her work. Extensive permanent\ncollections of Elizabeth Bartlett's papers, literary correspondence,\npublications, unpublished manuscripts, and art have been\nestablished, one as part of the Archive for New Poetry maintained\nby the Mandeville Department of Special Collections at the\nUniversity of California, San Diego, and the second by the Rare\nBooks Collection of the University of Louisville. Bartlett's\nreadings of her poetry have been recorded for the Library of\nCongress, Yale, Harvard, Stanford, and other collections.\n\nBartlett's twelve-tone form of poetry was introduced in her book,\n_Twelve-Tone Poems_, published in 1968. In Bartlett's words: \"The\n12-tone poem is a new form.... It was inspired by Arnold\nSchoenberg's musical system. The poem consists of 12 lines,\ndivided into couplets. Each couplet contains 12 syllables, using\nthe natural cadence of speech. The accented sounds of the words\nare considered tones. Only 12 tones are used throughout the poem,\nrepeated various times. As a result, the poem achieves a rare\nharmony that is purely lyrical, enriching its imagery and meaning.\"\n\nAbout this work, Allen Tate wrote: \"The new form is most\ninteresting, the poems quite beautiful and distinguished.\"\nEncouraged by this and other commendatory responses to her\ntwelve-tone poems by poets, musicians, and composers including\nStephen Sondheim, Bartlett continued to develop the new form.\n_The House of Sleep_, published in 1975, was the result, consisting\nof 62 poems related to dreams and written in the new form. Of these\npoems, William Stafford wrote: \"There is a trancelike progression\nin these poems, in which all unfolds quietly, with a steady holding\nof a certain pervasive tone.\" Robert M. Hutchins wrote: \"I am much\nimpressed. The poems seem to me what is called an important\ncontribution, and a beautiful one.\"\n\nA third collection of twelve-tone poems, _In Search of Identity_,\nwas published in 1977, further establishing the diversity and\nversatility of ways in which Bartlett was able to make use of the\nnew form. A fourth collection of twelve-tone poems was published\nin 1981, _Memory Is No Stranger_.\n\nHer husband, Paul Alexander Bartlett (1909 \u2013 1990) was an American\nwriter, artist, and poet. He made a large-scale study of more than\n350 Mexican haciendas, published novels, short stories, and poetry,\nand worked as a fine artist in a variety of media.
