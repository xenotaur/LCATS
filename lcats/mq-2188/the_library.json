Hope of being known in distant times--\nArrangement of the Library--Size and Form of the Volumes--The\nancient Folio, clasped and chained--Fashion prevalent even in this\nPlace--The Mode of publishing in Numbers, Pamphlets &c.--Subjects of\nthe different Classes--Divinity--Controversy--The Friends of\nReligion often more dangerous than her Foes--Sceptical Authors--\nReason too much rejected by the former Converts; exclusively relied\nupon by the latter--Philosophy ascending through the Scale of Being\nto Moral Subjects--Books of Medicine:  their Variety, Variance, and\nProneness to System:  the Evil of this, and the Difficulty it\ncauses--Farewell to this Study--Law:  the increasing Number of its\nVolumes--Supposed happy State of Man without Laws--Progress of\nSociety--Historians:  their Subjects--Dramatic Authors, Tragic and\nComic--Ancient Romances--The Captive Heroine--Happiness in the\nperusal of such Books:  why--Criticism--Apprehensions of the Author:\nremoved by the Appearance of the Genius of the Place; whose\nReasoning and Admonition conclude the subject.\n\nWhen the sad soul, by care and grief oppress'd,\nLooks round the world, but looks in vain for rest;\nWhen every object that appears in view\nPartakes her gloom and seems dejected too;\nWhere shall affliction from itself retire?\nWhere fade away and placidly expire?\nAlas! we fly to silent scenes in vain;\nCare blasts the honours of the flow'ry plain:\nCare veils in clouds the sun's meridian beam,\nSighs through the grove, and murmurs in the stream;\nFor when the soul is labouring in despair,\nIn vain the body breathes a purer air:\nNo storm-tost sailor sighs for slumbering seas,-\nHe dreads the tempest, but invokes the breeze;\nOn the smooth mirror of the deep resides\nReflected woe, and o'er unruffled tides\nThe ghost of every former danger glides.\nThus, in the calms of life, we only see\nA steadier image of our misery;\nBut lively gales and gently clouded skies\nDisperse the sad reflections as they rise;\nAnd busy thoughts and little cares avail\nTo ease the mind, when rest and reason fail.\nWhen the dull thought, by no designs employ'd,\nDwells on the past, or suffer'd or enjoy'd,\nWe bleed anew in every former grief,\nAnd joys departed furnish no relief.\n   Not Hope herself, with all her flattering art,\nCan cure this stubborn sickness of the heart:\nThe soul disdains each comfort she prepares,\nAnd anxious searches for congenial cares;\nThose lenient cares, which with our own combined,\nBy mix'd sensations ease th' afflicted mind,\nAnd steal our grief away, and leave their own behind;\nA lighter grief! which feeling hearts endure\nWithout regret, nor e'en demand a cure.\n   But what strange art, what magic can dispose\nThe troubled mind to change its native woes?\nOr lead us willing from ourselves, to see\nOthers more wretched, more undone than we?\nThis BOOKS can do;--nor this alone; they give\nNew views to life, and teach us how to live;\nThey soothe the grieved, the stubborn they chastise,\nFools they admonish, and confirm the wise:\nTheir aid they yield to all:  they never shun\nThe man of sorrow, nor the wretch undone:\nUnlike the hard, the selfish, and the proud,\nThey fly not sullen from the suppliant crowd;\nNor tell to various people various things,\nBut show to subjects what they show to kings.\n   Come, Child of Care! to make thy soul serene,\nApproach the treasures of this tranquil scene;\nSurvey the dome, and, as the doors unfold,\nThe soul's best cure, in all her cares, behold!\nWhere mental wealth the poor in thought may find,\nAnd mental physic the diseased in mind;\nSee here the balms that passion's wounds assuage;\nSee coolers here, that damp the fire of rage;\nHere alt'ratives, by slow degrees control\nThe chronic habits of the sickly soul;\nAnd round the heart and o'er the aching head,\nMild opiates here their sober influence shed.\nNow bid thy soul man's busy scenes exclude,\nAnd view composed this silent multitude:-\nSilent they are--but though deprived of sound,\nHere all the living languages abound;\nHere all that live no more; preserved they lie,\nIn tombs that open to the curious eye.\n   Blest be the gracious Power, who taught mankind\nTo stamp a lasting image of the mind!\nBeasts may convey, and tuneful birds may sing,\nTheir mutual feelings, in the opening spring ;\nBut Man alone has skill and power to send\nThe heart's warm dictates to the distant friend;\n'Tis his alone to please, instruct, advise\nAges remote, and nations yet to rise.\n   In sweet repose, when Labour's children sleep,\nWhen Joy forgets to smile and Care to weep,\nWhen Passion slumbers in the lover's breast,\nAnd Fear and Guilt partake the balm of rest,\nWhy then denies the studious man to share\nMan's common good, who feels his common care?\n   Because the hope is his, that bids him fly\nNight's soft repose, and sleep's mild power defy;\nThat after-ages may repeat his praise,\nAnd fame's fair meed be his, for length of days.\nDelightful prospect! when we leave behind\nA worthy offspring of the fruitful mind!\nWhich, born and nursed through many an anxious day,\nShall all our labour, all our care repay.\n   Yet all are not these births of noble kind,\nNot all the children of a vigorous mind;\nBut where the wisest should alone preside,\nThe weak would rule us, and the blind would guide;\nNay, man's best efforts taste of man, and show\nThe poor and troubled source from which they flow;\nWhere most he triumphs we his wants perceive,\nAnd for his weakness in his wisdom grieve.\nBut though imperfect all; yet wisdom loves\nThis seat serene, and virtue's self approves:-\nHere come the grieved, a change of thought to find;\nThe curious here to feed a craving mind;\nHere the devout their peaceful temple choose;\nAnd here the poet meets his favouring Muse.\n   With awe, around these silent walks I tread;\nThese are the lasting mansions of the dead:-\n\"The dead!\" methinks a thousand tongues reply;\n\"These are the tombs of such as cannot die!\"\nCrown'd with eternal fame, they sit sublime,\n\"And laugh at all the little strife of time.\"\n   Hail, then, immortals! ye who shine above,\nEach, in his sphere, the literary Jove;\nAnd ye the common people of these skies,\nA humbler crowd of nameless deities;\nWhether 'tis yours to lead the willing mind\nThrough History's mazes, and the turnings find;\nOr, whether led by Science, ye retire,\nLost and bewilder'd in the vast desire;\nWhether the Muse invites you to her bowers,\nAnd crowns your placid brows with living flowers;\nOr godlike Wisdom teaches you to show\nThe noblest road to happiness below;\nOr men and manners prompt the easy page\nTo mark the flying follies of the age:\nWhatever good ye boast, that good impart;\nInform the head and rectify the heart.\nLo, all in silence, all in order stand,\nAnd mighty folios first, a lordly band ;\nThen quartos their well-order'd ranks maintain,\nAnd light octavos fill a spacious plain:\nSee yonder, ranged in more frequented rows,\nA humbler band of duodecimos;\nWhile undistinguish'd trifles swell the scene,\nThe last new play and fritter'd magazine.\nThus 'tis in life, where first the proud, the great,\nIn leagued assembly keep their cumbrous state;\nHeavy and huge, they fill the world with dread,\nAre much admired, and are but little read:\nThe commons next, a middle rank, are found;\nProfessions fruitful pour their offspring round;\nReasoners and wits are next their place allowed,\nAnd last, of vulgar tribes a countless crowd.\n   First, let us view the form, the size, the dress;\nFor these the manners, nay the mind, express:\nThat weight of wood, with leathern coat o'erlaid;\nThose ample clasps, of solid metal made;\nThe close-press'd leaves, unclosed for many an age;\nThe dull red edging of the well-fill'd page;\nOn the broad back the stubborn ridges roll'd,\nWhere yet the title stands in tarnish'd gold;\nThese all a sage and labour'd work proclaim,\nA painful candidate for lasting fame:\nNo idle wit, no trifling verse can lurk\nIn the deep bosom of that weighty work;\nNo playful thoughts degrade the solemn style,\nNor one light sentence claims a transient smile.\n   Hence, in these times, untouch'd the pages lie,\nAnd slumber out their immortality:\nThey HAD their day, when, after after all his toil,\nHis morning study, and his midnight oil,\nAt length an author's ONE great work appeared,\nBy patient hope, and length of days, endear'd:\nExpecting nations hail'd it from the press;\nPoetic friends prefix'd each kind address;\nPrinces and kings received the pond'rous gift,\nAnd ladies read the work they could not lift.\nFashion, though Folly's child, and guide of fools,\nRules e'en the wisest, and in learning rules;\nFrom crowds and courts to \"Wisdom's seat she goes\nAnd reigns triumphant o'er her mother's foes.\nFor lo! these fav'rites of the ancient mode\nLie all neglected like the Birthday Ode.\n   Ah! needless now this weight of massy chain; {2}\nSafe in themselves, the once-loved works remain;\nNo readers now invade their still retreat,\nNone try to steal them from their parent-seat;\nLike ancient beauties, they may now discard\nChains, bolts, and locks, and lie without a guard.\n   Our patient fathers trifling themes laid by,\nAnd roll'd, o'er labour'd works, th' attentive eye:\nPage after page the much-enduring men\nExplored the deeps and shallows of the pen:\nTill, every former note and comment known,\nThey mark'd the spacious margin with their own;\nMinute corrections proved their studious care;\nThe little index, pointing, told us where;\nAnd many an emendation show'd the age\nLook'd far beyond the rubric title-page.\n   Our nicer palates lighter labours seek,\nCloy'd with a folio-NUMBER once a week;\nBibles, with cuts and comments, thus go down:\nE'en light Voltaire is NUMBER'D through the town:\nThus physic flies abroad, and thus the law,\nFrom men of study, and from men of straw;\nAbstracts, abridgments, please the fickle times,\nPamphlets and plays, and politics and rhymes:\nBut though to write be now a task of ease,\nThe task is hard by manly arts to please,\nWhen all our weakness is exposed to view,\nAnd half our judges are our rivals too.\n   Amid these works, on which the eager eye\nDelights to fix, or glides reluctant by,\nWhen all combined, their decent pomp display,\nWhere shall we first our early offering pay?\n   To thee, DIVINITY! to thee, the light\nAnd guide of mortals, through their mental night;\nBy whom we learn our hopes and fears to guide;\nTo bear with pain, and to contend with pride;\nWhen grieved, to pray; when injured, to forgive;\nAnd with the world in charity to live.\n   Not truths like these inspired that numerous race,\nWhose pious labours fill this ample space;\nBut questions nice, where doubt on doubt arose,\nAwaked to war the long-contending foes.\nFor dubious meanings, learned polemics strove,\nAnd wars on faith prevented works of love;\nThe brands of discord far around were hurl'd,\nAnd holy wrath inflamed a sinful world:-\nDull though impatient, peevish though devout,\nWith wit disgusting, and despised without;\nSaints in design, in execution men,\nPeace in their looks, and vengeance in their pen.\n   Methinks I see, and sicken at the sight,\nSpirits of spleen from yonder pile alight;\nSpirits who prompted every damning page,\nWith pontiff pride and still-increasing rage:\nLo! how they stretch their gloomy wings around,\nAnd lash with furious strokes the trembling ground!\nThey pray, they fight, they murder, and they weep,-\nWolves in their vengeance, in their manners sheep;\nToo well they act the prophet's fatal part,\nDenouncing evil with a zealous heart;\nAnd each, like Jonah, is displeased if God\nRepent his anger, or withhold his rod.\n   But here the dormant fury rests unsought,\nAnd Zeal sleeps soundly by the foes she fought;\nHere all the rage of controversy ends,\nAnd rival zealots rest like bosom-friends:\nAn Athanasian here, in deep repose,\nSleeps with the fiercest of his Arian foes;\nSocinians here with Calvinists abide,\nAnd thin partitions angry chiefs divide;\nHere wily Jesuits simple Quakers meet,\nAnd Bellarmine has rest at Luther's feet.\nGreat authors, for the church's glory fired,\nAre for the church's peace to rest retired;\nAnd close beside, a mystic, maudlin race,\nLie \"Crumbs of Comfort for the Babes of Grace.\"\n   Against her foes Religion well defends\nHer sacred truths, but often fears her friends:\nIf learn'd, their pride, if weak, their zeal she dreads,\nAnd their hearts' weakness, who have soundest heads.\nBut most she fears the controversial pen,\nThe holy strife of disputatious men;\nWho the blest Gospel's peaceful page explore,\nOnly to fight against its precepts more.\n   Near to these seats behold yon slender frames,\nAll closely fill'd and mark'd with modern names;\nWhere no fair science ever shows her face,\nFew sparks of genius, and no spark of grace;\nThere sceptics rest, a still-increasing throng,\nAnd stretch their widening wings ten thousand strong;\nSome in close fight their dubious claims maintain;\nSome skirmish lightly, fly, and fight again;\nColdly profane, and impiously gay,\nTheir end the same, though various in their way.\n   When first Religion came to bless the land,\nHer friends were then a firm believing band;\nTo doubt was then to plunge in guilt extreme,\nAnd all was gospel that a monk could dream;\nInsulted Reason fled the grov'lling soul,\nFor Fear to guide, and visions to control:\nBut now, when Reason has assumed her throne,\nShe, in her turn, demands to reign alone;\nRejecting all that lies beyond her view,\nAnd, being judge, will be a witness too:\nInsulted Faith then leaves the doubtful mind,\nTo seek for truth, without a power to find:\nAh! when will both in friendly beams unite,\nAnd pour on erring man resistless light?\n   Next to the seats, well stored with works divine,\nAn ample space, PHILOSOPHY! is thine;\nOur reason's guide, by whose assisting light\nWe trace the moral bounds of wrong and right;\nOur guide through nature, from the sterile clay,\nTo the bright orbs of yon celestial way!\n'Tis thine, the great, the golden chain to trace,\nWhich runs through all, connecting race with race;\nSave where those puzzling, stubborn links remain,\nWhich thy inferior light pursues in vain:-\n   How vice and virtue in the soul contend;\nHow widely differ, yet how nearly blend;\nWhat various passions war on either part,\nAnd now confirm, now melt the yielding heart:\nHow Fancy loves around the world to stray,\nWhile Judgment slowly picks his sober way;\nThe stores of memory, and the flights sublime\nOf genius, bound by neither space nor time; -\nAll these divine Philosophy explores,\nTill, lost in awe, she wonders and adores.\n   From these, descending to the earth, she turns,\nAnd matter, in its various forms, discerns;\nShe parts the beamy light with skill profound,\nMetes the thin air, and weighs the flying sound;\n'Tis hers the lightning from the clouds to call,\nAnd teach the fiery mischief where to fall.\n   Yet more her volumes teach,--on these we look\nAs abstracts drawn from Nature's larger book:\nHere, first described, the torpid earth appears,\nAnd next, the vegetable robe it wears;\nWhere flow'ry tribes, in valleys, fields, and groves,\nNurse the still flame, and feed the silent loves;\nLoves where no grief, nor joy, nor bliss, nor pain,\nWarm the glad heart or vex the labouring brain;\nBut as the green blood moves along the blade,\nThe bed of Flora on the branch is made;\nWhere, without passion love instinctive lives,\nAnd gives new life, unconscious that it gives.\nAdvancing still in Nature's maze, we trace,\nIn dens and burning plains, her savage race\nWith those tame tribes who on their lord attend,\nAnd find in man a master and a friend;\nMan crowns the scene, a world of wonders new,\nA moral world, that well demands our view.\n   This world is here; for, of more lofty kind,\nThese neighbouring volumes reason on the mind;\nThey paint the state of man ere yet endued\nWith knowledge;--man, poor, ignorant, and rude;\nThen, as his state improves, their pages swell,\nAnd all its cares, and all its comforts, tell:\nHere we behold how inexperience buys,\nAt little price, the wisdom of the wise;\nWithout the troubles of an active state,\nWithout the cares and dangers of the great,\nWithout the miseries of the poor, we know\nWhat wisdom, wealth, and poverty bestow;\nWe see how reason calms the raging mind,\nAnd how contending passions urge mankind:\nSome, won by virtue, glow with sacred fire;\nSome, lured by vice, indulge the low desire;\nWhilst others, won by either, now pursue\nThe guilty chase, now keep the good in view;\nFor ever wretched, with themselves at strife,\nThey lead a puzzled, vex'd, uncertain life;\nFor transient vice bequeaths a lingering pain,\nWhich transient virtue seeks to cure in vain.\n   Whilst thus engaged, high views enlarge the soul,\nNew interests draw, new principles control:\nNor thus the soul alone resigns her grief,\nBut here the tortured body finds relief;\nFor see where yonder sage Arachne shapes\nHer subtile gin, that not a fly escapes!\nThere PHYSIC fills the space, and far around,\nPile above pile her learned works abound:\nGlorious their aim- to ease the labouring heart;\nTo war with death, and stop his flying dart;\nTo trace the source whence the fierce contest grew,\nAnd life's short lease on easier terms renew;\nTo calm the phrensy of the burning brain;\nTo heal the tortures of imploring pain;\nOr, when more powerful ills all efforts brave,\nTo ease the victim no device can save,\nAnd smooth the stormy passage to the grave.\n   But man, who knows no good unmix'd and pure,\nOft finds a poison where he sought a cure;\nFor grave deceivers lodge their labours here,\nAnd cloud the science they pretend to clear;\nScourges for sin, the solemn tribe are sent;\nLike fire and storms, they call us to repent;\nBut storms subside, and fires forget to rage.\nTHESE are eternal scourges of the age:\n'Tis not enough that each terrific hand\nSpreads desolations round a guilty land;\nBut train'd to ill, and harden'd by its crimes,\nTheir pen relentless kills through future times.\n   Say, ye, who search these records of the dead-\nWho read huge works, to boast what ye have read;\nCan all the real knowledge ye possess,\nOr those--if such there are--who more than guess,\nAtone for each impostor's wild mistakes,\nAnd mend the blunders pride or folly makes ?\n   What thought so wild, what airy dream so light,\nThat will not prompt a theorist to write?\nWhat art so prevalent, what proof so strong,\nThat will convince him his attempt is wrong?\nOne in the solids finds each lurking ill,\nNor grants the passive fluids power to kill;\nA learned friend some subtler reason brings,\nAbsolves the channels, but condemns their springs;\nThe subtile nerves, that shun the doctor's eye,\nEscape no more his subtler theory;\nThe vital heat, that warms the labouring heart,\nLends a fair system to these sons of art;\nThe vital air, a pure and subtile stream,\nServes a foundation for an airy scheme,\nAssists the doctor, and supports his dream.\nSome have their favourite ills, and each disease\nIs but a younger branch that kills from these;\nOne to the gout contracts all human pain;\nHe views it raging in the frantic brain;\nFinds it in fevers all his efforts mar,\nAnd sees it lurking in the cold catarrh:\nBilious by some, by others nervous seen,\nRage the fantastic demons of the spleen;\nAnd every symptom of the strange disease\nWith every system of the sage agrees.\n   Ye frigid tribe, on whom I wasted long\nThe tedious hours, and ne'er indulged in song;\nYe first seducers of my easy heart,\nWho promised knowledge ye could not impart;\nYe dull deluders, truth's destructive foes;\nYe sons of fiction, clad in stupid prose;\nYe treacherous leaders, who, yourselves in doubt,\nLight up false fires, and send us far about;-\nStill may yon spider round your pages spin,\nSubtile and slow, her emblematic gin!\nBuried in dust and lost in silence, dwell,\nMost potent, grave, and reverend friends--farewell!\n   Near these, and where the setting sun displays,\nThrough the dim window, his departing rays,\nAnd gilds yon columns, there, on either side,\nThe huge Abridgments of the LAW abide;\nFruitful as vice the dread correctors stand,\nAnd spread their guardian terrors round the land;\nYet, as the best that human care can do\nIs mix'd with error, oft with evil too,\nSkill'd in deceit, and practised to evade,\nKnaves stand secure, for whom these laws were made,\nAnd justice vainly each expedient tries,\nWhile art eludes it, or while power defies.\n\"Ah! happy age,\" the youthful poet sings,\n\"When the free nations knew not laws nor kings,\nWhen all were blest to share a common store,\nAnd none were proud of wealth, for none were poor,\nNo wars nor tumults vex'd each still domain,\nNo thirst of empire, no desire of gain;\nNo proud great man, nor one who would be great,\nDrove modest merit from its proper state;\nNor into distant climes would Avarice roam,\nTo fetch delights for Luxury at home:\nBound by no ties which kept the soul in awe,\nThey dwelt at liberty, and love was law!\"\n   \"Mistaken youth! each nation first was rude,\nEach man a cheerless son of solitude,\nTo whom no joys of social life were known,\nNone felt a care that was not all his own;\nOr in some languid clime his abject soul\nBow'd to a little tyrant's stern control;\nA slave, with slaves his monarch's throne he raised,\nAnd in rude song his ruder idol praised;\nThe meaner cares of life were all he knew;\nBounded his pleasures, and his wishes few;\nBut when by slow degrees the Arts arose,\nAnd Science waken'd from her long repose;\nWhen Commerce, rising from the bed of ease,\nRan round the land, and pointed to the seas;\nWhen Emulation, born with jealous eye,\nAnd Avarice, lent their spurs to industry;\nThen one by one the numerous laws were made,\nThose to control, and these to succour trade;\nTo curb the insolence of rude command,\nTo snatch the victim from the usurer's hand;\nTo awe the bold, to yield the wrong'd redress,\nAnd feed the poor with Luxury's excess.\" {3}\n   Like some vast flood, unbounded, fierce, and strong,\nHis nature leads ungovern'd man along;\nLike mighty bulwarks made to stem that tide,\nThe laws are form'd, and placed on ev'ry side;\nWhene'er it breaks the bounds by these decreed,\nNew statutes rise, and stronger laws succeed;\nMore and more gentle grows the dying stream,\nMore and more strong the rising bulwarks seem;\nTill, like a miner working sure and slow,\nLuxury creeps on, and ruins all below;\nThe basis sinks, the ample piles decay;\nThe stately fabric, shakes and falls away;\nPrimeval want and ignorance come on,\nBut Freedom, that exalts the savage state, is gone.\n   Next, HISTORY ranks;--there full in front she lies,\nAnd every nation her dread tale supplies;\nYet History has her doubts, and every age\nWith sceptic queries marks the passing page;\nRecords of old nor later date are clear,\nToo distant those, and these are placed too near;\nThere time conceals the objects from our view,\nHere our own passions and a writer's too:\nYet, in these volumes, see how states arose!\nGuarded by virtue from surrounding foes;\nTheir virtue lost, and of their triumphs vain,\nLo! how they sunk to slavery again!\nSatiate with power, of fame and wealth possess'd,\nA nation grows too glorious to be blest;\nConspicuous made, she stands the mark of all,\nAnd foes join foes to triumph in her fall.\n   Thus speaks the page that paints ambition's race,\nThe monarch's pride, his glory, his disgrace;\nThe headlong course, that madd'ning heroes run,\nHow soon triumphant, and how soon undone;\nHow slaves, turn'd tyrants, offer crowns to sale,\nAnd each fall'n nation's melancholy tale.\n   Lo! where of late the Book of Martyrs stood,\nOld pious tracts, and Bibles bound in wood;\nThere, such the taste of our degenerate age,\nStand the profane delusions of the STAGE:\nYet virtue owns the TRAGIC MUSE a friend,\nFable her means, morality her end;\nFor this she rules all passions in their turns,\nAnd now the bosom bleeds, and now it burns;\nPity with weeping eye surveys her bowl,\nHer anger swells, her terror chills the soul;\nShe makes the vile to virtue yield applause,\nAnd own her sceptre while they break her laws;\nFor vice in others is abhorr'd of all,\nAnd villains triumph when the worthless fall.\n   Not thus her sister COMEDY prevails,\nWho shoots at Folly, for her arrow fails;\nFolly, by Dulness arm'd, eludes the wound,\nAnd harmless sees the feather'd shafts rebound;\nUnhurt she stands, applauds the archer's skill,\nLaughs at her malice, and is Folly still.\nYet well the Muse portrays, in fancied scenes,\nWhat pride will stoop to, what profession means;\nHow formal fools the farce of state applaud;\nHow caution watches at the lips of fraud;\nThe wordy variance of domestic life;\nThe tyrant husband, the retorting wife;\nThe snares for innocence, the lie of trade,\nAnd the smooth tongue's habitual masquerade.\n   With her the Virtues too obtain a place,\nEach gentle passion, each becoming grace;\nThe social joy in life's securer road,\nIts easy pleasure, its substantial good;\nThe happy thought that conscious virtue gives,\nAnd all that ought to live, and all that lives.\n   But who are these? Methinks a noble mien\nAnd awful grandeur in their form are seen,\nNow in disgrace:  what though by time is spread\nPolluting dust o'er every reverend head;\nWhat though beneath yon gilded tribe they lie,\nAnd dull observers pass insulting by:\nForbid it shame, forbid it decent awe,\nWhat seems so grave, should no attention draw!\nCome, let us then with reverend step advance,\nAnd greet--the ancient worthies of ROMANCE.\n   Hence, ye profane! I feel a former dread,\nA thousand visions float around my head:\nHark! hollow blasts through empty courts resound,\nAnd shadowy forms with staring eyes stalk round;\nSee! moats and bridges, walls and castles rise,\nGhosts, fairies, demons, dance before our eyes;\nLo! magic verse inscribed on golden gate,\nAnd bloody hand that beckons on to fate:-\n\"And who art thou, thou little page, unfold?\nSay, doth thy lord my Claribel withhold?\nGo tell him straight, Sir Knight, thou must resign\nThe captive queen;--for Claribel is mine.\"\nAway he flies; and now for bloody deeds,\nBlack suits of armour, masks, and foaming steeds;\nThe giant falls; his recreant throat I seize,\nAnd from his corslet take the massy keys:-\nDukes, lords, and knights, in long procession move,\nReleased from bondage with my virgin love:-\nShe comes! she comes! in all the charms of youth,\nUnequall'd love, and unsuspected truth!\nAh! happy he who thus, in magic themes,\nO'er worlds bewitch'd, in early rapture dreams,\nWhere wild Enchantment waves her potent wand,\nAnd Fancy's beauties fill her fairy land;\nWhere doubtful objects strange desires excite,\nAnd Fear and Ignorance afford delight.\n   But lost, for ever lost, to me these joys,\nWhich Reason scatters, and which Time destroys;\nToo dearly bought:  maturer judgment calls\nMy busied mind from tales and madrigals;\nMy doughty giants all are slain or fled,\nAnd all my knignts--blue, green, and yellow--dead!\nNo more the midnight fairy tribe I view,\nAll in the merry moonshine tippling dew;\nE'en the last lingering fiction of the brain,\nThe churchyard ghost, is now at rest again;\nAnd all these wayward wanderings of my youth\nFly Reason's power, and shun the light of Truth.\n   With Fiction then does real joy reside,\nAnd is our reason the delusive guide?\nIs it then right to dream the syrens sing?\nOr mount enraptured on the dragon's wing?\nNo; 'tis the infant mind, to care unknown,\nThat makes th' imagined paradise its own;\nSoon as reflections in the bosom rise,\nLight slumbers vanish from the clouded eyes:\nThe tear and smile, that once together rose,\nAre then divorced; the head and heart are foes:\nEnchantment bows to Wisdom's serious plan,\nAnd Pain and Prudence make and mar the man.\n   While thus, of power and fancied empire vain,\nWith various thoughts my mind I entertain;\nWhile books, my slaves, with tyrant hand I seize,\nPleased with the pride that will not let them please,\nSudden I find terrific thoughts arise,\nAnd sympathetic sorrow fills my eyes;\nFor, lo! while yet my heart admits the wound,\nI see the CRITIC army ranged around.\n   Foes to our race! if ever ye have known\nA father's fears for offspring of your own;\nIf ever, smiling o'er a lucky line,\nYe thought the sudden sentiment divine,\nThen paused and doubted, and then, tired of doubt,\nWith rage as sudden dash'd the stanza out;-\nIf, after fearing much and pausing long,\nYe ventured on the world your labour'd song,\nAnd from the crusty critics of those days\nImplored the feeble tribute of their praise;\nRemember now the fears that moved you then,\nAnd, spite of truth, let mercy guide your pen.\n   What vent'rous race are ours! what mighty foes\nLie waiting all around them to oppose!\nWhat treacherous friends betray them to the fight!\nWhat dangers threaten them--yet still they write:\nA hapless tribe! to every evil born,\nWhom villains hate, and fools affect to scorn:\nStrangers they come, amid a world of woe,\nAnd taste the largest portion ere they go.\n   Pensive I spoke, and cast mine eyes around;\nThe roof, methought, return'd a solemn sound;\nEach column seem'd to shake, and clouds, like smoke,\nFrom dusty piles and ancient volumes broke;\nGathering above, like mists condensed they seem,\nExhaled in summer from the rushy stream;\nLike flowing robes they now appear, and twine\nRound the large members of a form divine;\nHis silver beard, that swept his aged breast,\nHis piercing eye, that inward light express'd,\nWere seen,--but clouds and darkness veil'd the rest.\nFear chill'd my heart:  to one of mortal race,\nHow awful seem'd the Genius of the place!\nSo in Cimmerian shores, Ulysses saw\nHis parent-shade, and shrunk in pious awe;\nLike him I stood, and wrapt in thought profound,\nWhen from the pitying power broke forth a solemn sound:-\n\"Care lives with all; no rules, no precepts save\nThe wise from woe, no fortitude the brave;\nGrief is to man as certain as the grave:\nTempests and storms in life's whole progress rise,\nAnd hope shines dimly through o'erclouded skies.\nSome drops of comfort on the favour'd fall,\nBut showers of sorrow are the lot of ALL:\nPartial to talents, then, shall Heav'n withdraw\nTh' afflicting rod, or break the general law?\nShall he who soars, inspired by loftier views,\nLife's little cares and little pains refuse?\nShall he not rather feel a double share\nOf mortal woe, when doubly arm'd to bear?\n   \"Hard is his fate who builds his peace of mind\nOn the precarious mercy of mankind;\nWho hopes for wild and visionary things,\nAnd mounts o'er unknown seas with vent'rous wings;\nBut as, of various evils that befall\nThe human race, some portion goes to all;\nTo him perhaps the milder lot's assigned\nWho feels his consolation in his mind,\nAnd, lock'd within his bosom, bears about\nA mental charm for every care without.\nE'en in the pangs of each domestic grief,\nOr health or vigorous hope affords relief;\nAnd every wound the tortured bosom feels,\nOr virtue bears, or some preserver heals;\nSome generous friend of ample power possess'd;\nSome feeling heart, that bleeds for the distress'd;\nSome breast that glows with virtues all divine;\nSome noble RUTLAND, misery's friend and thine.\n   \"Nor say, the Muse's song, the Poet's pen,\nMerit the scorn they meet from little men.\nWith cautious freedom if the numbers flow,\nNot wildly high, nor pitifully low;\nIf vice alone their honest aims oppose,\nWhy so ashamed their friends, so loud their foes?\nHappy for men in every age and clime,\nIf all the sons of vision dealt in rhyme.\nGo on, then, Son of Vision! still pursue\nThy airy dreams; the world is dreaming too.\nAmbition's lofty views, the pomp of state,\nThe pride of wealth, the splendour of the great,\nStripp'd of their mask, their cares and troubles known,\nAre visions far less happy than thy own:\nGo on! and, while the sons of care complain,\nBe wisely gay and innocently vain;\nWhile serious souls are by their fears undone,\nBlow sportive bladders in the beamy sun,\nAnd call them worlds! and bid the greatest show\nMore radiant colours in their worlds below:\nThen, as they break, the slaves of care reprove,\nAnd tell them, Such are all the toys they love.\"\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes:\n\n{1}  Indentation and punctuation as original.\n\n{2}  In ancient libraries, works of value and importance were\nfastened to their places by a length of chain; and might so be\nperused, but not taken away.\n\n{3}  See Blackstone's Commentaries, i. 131, 359; iv. 432.",
