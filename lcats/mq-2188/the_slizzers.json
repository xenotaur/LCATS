    "body": "They're all around us. I'll call them the _slizzers_, because they\n_sliz_ people. Lord only knows how long they've been on Earth, and how\nmany of them there are....\n\nThey're all around us, living with us. We are hardly ever aware of\ntheir existence, because they can _make_ themselves look like us, and\ndo most of the time; and if they can look like us, there's really no\nneed for them to think like us, is there? People think and behave in\nso many cockeyed ways, anyhow. Whenever a _slizzer_ fumbles a little\nin his impersonation of a human being, and comes up with a puzzling\nresponse, I suppose we just shrug and think. _He could use a good\npsychiatrist._\n\nSo ... you might be one. Or your best friend, or your wife or husband,\nor that nice lady next door.\n\nThey aren't killers, or rampaging monsters; quite the contrary. They\nneed us, something like the way we'd need maple trees if it came to\nthe point where maple syrup was our only food. That's why we're in no\ncomic-book danger of being destroyed, any more than maple trees would\nbe, in the circumstances I just mentioned--or are, as things go. In a\nsense, we're rather well-treated and helped along a bit ... the way we\ncare for maple trees.\n\nBut, sometimes a man here and there will be careless, or ignorant, or\ngreedy ... and a maple tree will be hurt....\n\nThink about that the next time someone is real nice to you. He may be\na _slizzer_ ... and a careless one....\n\nHow long do we live?\n\nRight. About sixty, seventy years.\n\nYou probably don't think much about that, because that's just the way\nthings are. That's life. And what the hell, the doctors are increasing\nour lifespan every day with new drugs and things, aren't they?\n\nSure.\n\nBut perhaps we'd live to be about a _thousand_, if the _slizzers_ left\nus alone.\n\nEver stop to think how little we know about why we live? ... what it\nis that takes our structure of bones and coldcuts and gives it the\nfunction we call \"life?\"\n\nSome mysterious life-substance or force the doctors haven't pinned\ndown yet, you say--and that's as good a definition as any.\n\nWell, we're maple trees to the _slizzers_, and that life-stuff is the\nsap we supply them. They do it mostly when we're feeling good--feeling\nreally terrific. It's easier to tap us that way, and there's more to\nbe had. (Maybe that's what makes so-called manic-depressives ... they\nattract _slizzers_ when they feel tip-top; the _slizzers_ feed; and\n_floo-o-m_ ... depressive.)\n\nLike I say, think about all this next time someone treats you just\nginger-peachy, and makes you feel all warm inside.\n\nSo see how long that feeling lasts ... and who is hanging around you\nat the time. Experiment. See if it doesn't happen again and again with\nthe same people, and if you don't usually end up wondering where in\nhell your nice warm feeling went off to....\n\n\n\nI found out about the _slizzers_ when I went up to Joe Arnold's\napartment last Friday night.\n\nJoe opened the door and let me in. He flashed me his big junior-exec's\ngrin and said, \"Sit, Jerry. I'll mix you a gin and. The others'll be\nalong in awhile and we can get the action started.\"\n\nI sat down in my usual chair. Joe had already fixed up the table ...\ngreen felt top, ashtrays, coasters, cards, chips. I said, \"If\nMel--that's his name, isn't it, the new guy?--if he starts calling\nwild games again when it comes his deal, I'll walk out. I don't like\n'em.\" I looked at the drink Joe was mixing. \"More gin.\"\n\nJoe crimped half a lime into the glass. \"He won't call any crazy stuff\ntonight. I told him that if he did, we wouldn't invite him back. He\nnearly ruined the whole session, didn't he?\"\n\nI nodded and took the drink. Joe mixes them right--just the way I like\nthem. They make me feel good inside. \"How about a little blackjack\nwhile we're waiting?\"\n\n\"Sure. They're late, anyway.\"\n\nI got first ace, and dealt. We traded a few chips back and\nforth--nothing exciting--and on the ninth deal Joe got blackjack.\n\nHe shuffled, buried a trey, and gave me an ace-down, duck-up.\n\n\"Hit me,\" I said contentedly.\n\nJoe gave me another ace.\n\n\"Mama! ... hit me again.\"\n\nA four.\n\n\"Son,\" I told him, \"you're in for a royal beating. Again.\"\n\nA deuce.\n\nJoe winced.\n\nI turned up my hole ace and said, \"Give me a sixth, you poor son. I\ncan't lose.\"\n\nA nine.\n\n\"Nineteen in six,\" I crowed. I counted up my bets: five dollars. \"You\nowe me fifteen bucks!\"\n\nThen I looked up at him.\n\nI'll repeat myself. You know that hot flush of pure delight, of high\ntriumph, even of mild avarice that possesses you from tingling scalp\nto tingling toe when you've pulled off a doozy? If you play cards,\nyou've been there. If you don't play cards, just think back to the\nlast time someone complimented the pants off you, or the last time you\nclinched a big deal, or the last time a sweet kid you'd been hot after\nsaid, \"Yes.\"\n\nThat's the feeling I mean ... the feeling I had.\n\nAnd Joe Arnold was eating it.\n\nI knew it, somehow, the moment I saw his eyes and hands. His eyes\nweren't Joe Arnold's blue eyes any longer. They were wet balls of\nshining black that took up half his face, and they looked hungry. His\narms were straight out in front of him; his hands were splayed tensely\nabout a foot from my face. The fingers were thinner and much longer\nthan I could recall Joe's being, and they just _looked_ like antennae\nor electrodes or something, stretched wide-open that way and\nquivering, and I just _knew_ that they were picking up and draining\noff into Joe's body all the elation, the excitement, the warmth that I\nfelt.\n\nI looked at him and wondered why I couldn't scream or move a muscle.\n\n\"Guess I made a boo-boo,\" he said. He blinked his big black globes of\neyes. \"No harm done, though.\"\n\nHis head had thinned down, just like his fingers, and now came to a\npeak on top.\n\nHe had practically no shoulders. He smiled at me, and I saw long black\nhair growing on the insides of his lips.\n\n_What are you?_ I screamed at him to myself.\n\nJoe licked his hairy lips and folded those long inhuman hands in front\nof him.\n\n\"It hurts like hell,\" he said in a not-human voice, \"to be _slizzing_\nyou and then have you chill off on me that way, Jerry. But it's my own\nfault, I guess.\"\n\n\n\nThe door-bell rang--two soft tones. Joe got up and let in the other\nmembers of our Friday night poker group. I tried to move and couldn't.\n\nFred raised his eyebrows when he saw Joe's face and hands. \"Jerry\nisn't here yet? Relaxing a little?\" Then he saw me sitting there and\nwhistled. \"Oh, you slipped up, eh?\"\n\nJoe nodded. \"You were late, and I was hungry, so I thought I'd go\nahead and take my share. I gave him a big kick, and he really poured\nit out ... radiated like all hell. I took it in so fast that I\n_fluhped_ and lost my plasmic control.\"\n\n\"We might as well eat now, then,\" Ray said, \"before we get down to\nplaying cards.\" He sat down across the table, his eyes--now suddenly\nenormous and black--eagerly on me. \"I hate like hell waiting until you\ndeal him a big pot--\"\n\n\"_No_,\" Joe said sharply. \"Too much at one time, and he'd wonder what\nhit him. We'll do it just like always ... one of us at a time, and\nonly a little at a time. Get him when he rakes in the loot. They never\nmiss it when they feel like that.\"\n\n\"He's right,\" Fred said. \"Take it easy, Ray.\" He went over to the\nsideboard and began mixing drinks.\n\nJoe looked down at me with his black end-of-eggplant eyes.\n\n\"Now to fix things,\" he said.\n\n... I blinked and shook my head. \"You owe me fifteen bucks!\" I said.\n\n\"Lord,\" Joe wailed, \"did this gonif just take me!\"\n\nRay groaned sympathetically from the chair across the table, where\nhe'd been watching the slaughter. \"And how!\"\n\nJoe pushed fifteen blue chips at me. I began stacking them. \"Well,\nthat's life,\" I grinned. Then I shook my head again. \"It's the\ndamnedest thing....\"\n\n\"What?\" Fred asked. He'd been over at the sideboard mixing drinks for\nthe gang while I'd taken Joe over the bumps. Now he brought the tray\nover and shoved a tall one into Joe's hand. \"Don't cry, Joe. What's\nthe damnedest thing, Jerry?\"\n\n\"You know ... that funny feeling that you've been some place\nbefore--the same place, the same people, saying the same things--but\nyou can't remember where the hell or when, for the life of you. Had it\njust a moment ago, when I told Joe he owed me fifteen bucks. What do\nthey call it again?\"\n\n\"_Deja vu_,\" said Allen, who's sort of the scholarly type. \"Means\n'seen before' in French, I think. Or something like that.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" I said. \"_Deja vu_ ... it's the damnedest funniest\nfeeling. I guess people have it all the time, don't they?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Allen said.\n\nThen he paused. \"People do.\"\n\n\"Wonder what causes it?\"\n\nJoe's blue eyes were twinkling. \"Dunno. The psychologists have an\nexplanation for it, but it's probably wrong.\"\n\n\"Wrong why?\" Knowing Joe, I expected a gag. I got it.\n\n\"Well,\" Joe said. \"Let _me_ make up a theory. H'm ... hoo, hah ...\nwell, it's like _this_: there are monsters all around us, see, but we\ndon't know they're monsters except that every once in a while one of\nthem slips up in his disguise and shows himself for what he really is.\nBut this doesn't bother our monsters. They simply reach into our minds\nand twiddle around and--zoop!--you're right back where you were before\nthe slip was--\"\n\n\"Very funny,\" Fred said boredly. \"Maybe losing fifteen bucks made you\nlose a little sense, Joe. You wouldn't want to lose more than fifteen\nbucks, would you? You need some caution in the games we play, no? So\ncut the nonsense and let's run 'em.\"\n\nRay licked his lips. \"Yeah. Let's play, huh, fellows?\"\n\nRay's always eager to get started.\n\n\n\nWe played until 3 A. M. I won forty-six dollars. (I usually do win ...\nI guess over a period of six months or so I'm about five-hundred bucks\nahead of the game. Which is why I like to play over at Joe's, even\nthough I _am_ always so damned tired when I leave. Guess I'm not as\nyoung as I was.)\n\nSometimes I wonder why the odds go my way, right down the line. I\nalmost _never_ lose. But, hell, it _must_ be an honest game ... and if\nthey're willing to go on losing to \"Lucky\" Bixby, I'm perfectly\nwilling to go on winning.\n\nAfter all, can you think of any reason that makes any sense for\nsomeone to rig a game week after week to let you _win_?\n\nFrederik Boles, Author's Agent                   Oct. 20\n\n2200 Fifth Avenue\n\nNew York, N. Y.\n\nDear Fred,\n\n     Well, here's a new story. I've cleared it with Joe ... he\n     says it's okay to use his name; you know his sense of humor.\n     I've used your name, too, but you can change it if you want\n     to, being the shy retiring sort you are.\n\n     Frankly, I'm a little dubious about the yarn. It's the\n     result of last Friday's poker-session.... I actually did\n     have the _deja vu_ sensation, as you'll recall. On the way\n     home I stopped in to pick up a chaser, feeling tired as all\n     hell (like I always do--these long grinds are too much for\n     me, I guess, just like the guy in the story) and the idea\n     came to me to slap the old \"we are fodder\" angle into the\n     thing as it happened and write it up.\n\n     But it's still an old plot. And one angle is left\n     unexplained: how is the narrator able to know all about the\n     _slizzers_ and write about them after Joe gives him the\n     _deja vu_ treatment?\n\n     Well, maybe the readers won't mind. I've gotten away with\n     bigger holes than that. Try it on Bob Lowndes ... I still\n     owe him on that advance. It's up his alley, hope-a-hope.\n\n                                                     Jerry\n\n                                                 Oct. 22, 1952\n\nJerome Bixby\n\n862 Union Street\n\nBrooklyn, N. Y.\n\nDear Jerry,\n\n     I don't go for \"The Slizzers.\" It just ain't convincing. As\n     you say, it's an old idea ... and besides--again as you\n     say--how does the narrator know what happened?\n\n     The manuscript looks good in my wastebasket. Forget about\n     it.\n\n                                       Sympathies.\n\n                                                     Fred\n\n                                                 Oct. 23, 1952\n\nFrederik Boles, Author's Agent\n\n2200 Fifth Avenue\n\nNew York, N. Y.\n\n     Dear Wet Blanket (and aren't you a little old for that?)\n\n     Respectfully nuts to you. After proper browbeating I think\n     I'll try the yarn on Lowndes ... it's no masterpiece, but I\n     think it's got a chance; he likes an off trail bit, now and\n     then. I made a carbon, natch, so your ditching of the\n     original comes to naught.\n\n     Funny thing ... every time I read it over I get the\n     doggonedest _deja vu_ feeling. Real dynamic thing ... almost\n     lifts my hair. Hope it does the same for the readers, them\n     as can read. Maybe Joe didn't quite do the job of making me\n     forget what happened that night, ha, ha. Say! ... maybe that\n     could explain the _narrator's_ remembering what happened ...\n     or maybe--hey! A _real_ idea!\n\n     Remember Joe's kidding us about monsters?--remember, you got\n     a little sore because he was holding up the game, you\n     money-hungry son? I think I'll rewrite the ending to include\n     that! ... which oughta take care of the narrator's\n     remembering: Joe can be sort of a dopey _slizzer_, a\n     blat-mouth, and his screwy theory (which is _true_ in the\n     story, or will be when I write it in--say, isn't this\n     involved!) can trigger our hero's memory just a bit, shake\n     the block a mite, undiddle the synapses etc ... and then\n     I'll have you, platinum-butt, step in to head Joe off, under\n     pretense of a poker itch.\n\n     You know, it's wonderful the way there are hot story ideas\n     in plain old everyday things! S'long ... gonna revise.\n\n                                                     Jerry\n\n                                                 Oct. 23, 1952\n\nMr. Robert W.

Think I'll send Bob a line or two\n     to stick on the end ... you know, the old incompleted\n     sentence deal ... just as if, while the narrator was\n     finishing the story, the _slizzers_ came in and\n\n",
