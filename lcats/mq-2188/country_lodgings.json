    "body": "Between two and three years ago, the following pithy advertisement\nappeared in several of the London papers:--\n\n     \"Country Lodgings.--Apartments to let in a large farm-house,\n     situate in a cheap and pleasant village, about forty miles\n     from London. Apply (if by letter post-paid) to A. B., No. 7,\n     Salisbury-street, Strand.\"\n\nLittle did I think, whilst admiring in the broad page of the Morning\nChronicle the compendious brevity of this announcement, that the\npleasant village referred to was our own dear Aberleigh; and that the\nfirst tenant of those apartments should be a lady whose family I had\nlong known, and in whose fortunes and destiny I took a more than common\ninterest!\n\nUpton Court was a manor-house of considerable extent, which had in\nformer times been the residence of a distinguished Catholic family,\nbut which, in the changes of property incident to our fluctuating\nneighbourhood, was now \"fallen from its high estate,\" and degraded\ninto the homestead of a farm so small, that the tenant, a yeoman of\nthe poorest class, was fain to eke out his rent by entering into an\nagreement with a speculating Belford upholsterer, and letting off a part\nof the fine old mansion in the shape of furnished lodgings.\n\nNothing could be finer than the situation of Upton, placed on the summit\nof a steep acclivity, looking over a rich and fertile valley to a range\nof woody hills; nothing more beautiful than the approach from Belford,\nthe road leading across a common between a double row of noble oaks, the\nground on one side sinking with the abruptness of a north-country burn,\nwhilst a clear spring, bursting from the hill side, made its way to the\nbottom between patches of shaggy underwood and a grove of smaller\ntrees; a vine-covered cottage just peeping between the foliage, and the\npicturesque outline of the Court, with its old-fashioned porch, its long\nwindows, and its tall, clustered chimneys towering in the distance. It\nwas the prettiest prospect in all Aberleigh.\n\nThe house itself retained strong marks of former stateliness, especially\nin one projecting wing, too remote from the yard to be devoted to the\ndomestic purposes of the farmer's family. The fine proportions of the\nlofty and spacious apartments, the rich mouldings of the ceilings, the\ncarved chimney-pieces, and the panelled walls, all attested the former\ngrandeur of the mansion; whilst the fragments of stained glass in the\nwindows of the great gallery, the half-effaced coats of arms over the\ndoor-way, the faded family portraits, grim black-visaged knights,\nand pale shadowy ladies, or the reliques of mouldering tapestry\nthat fluttered against the walls, and, above all, the secret chamber\nconstructed for the priest's hiding-place in days of Protestant\npersecution, for in darker ages neither of the dominant churches was\nfree from that foul stain,--each of these vestiges of the manners and\nthe history of times long gone by appealed to the imagination, and\nconspired to give a Mrs. Radcliffe-like, Castle-of-Udolpho-sort of\nromance to the manor-house. Really, when the wind swept through the\novergrown espaliers of that neglected but luxuriant wilderness, the\nterraced garden; when the screech-owl shrieked from the ivy which\nclustered up one side of the walls, and \"rats and mice, and such small\ndeer,\" were playing their pranks behind the wainscot, it would have\nformed as pretty a locality for a supernatural adventure, as ever\ndecayed hunting lodge in the recesses of the Hartz, or ruined fortress\non the castled Rhine. Nothing was wanting but the ghost, and a ghost of\nany taste would have been proud of such a habitation.\n\nLess like a ghost than the inhabitant who did arrive, no human being\nwell could be.\n\nMrs. Cameron was a young widow. Her father, a Scotch officer, well-born,\nsickly, and poor, had been but too happy to bestow the hand of his only\nchild upon an old friend and fellow-countryman, the principal clerk in\na government office, whose respectable station, easy fortune, excellent\nsense, and super-excellent character, were, as he thought, and as\nfathers, right or wrong, are apt to think, advantages more than\nsufficient to counterbalance a disparity of years and appearance,\nwhich some daughters might have thought startling,--the bride being\na beautiful girl of seventeen, the bridegroom a plain man of\nseven-and-fifty. In this case, at least, the father was right. He lived\nlong enough to see that the young wife was unusually attached to her\nkind and indulgent husband, and died, about a twelve-month after\nthe marriage, with the fullest confidence in her respectability and\nhappiness. Mr. Cameron did not long survive him. Before she was nineteen\nthe fair Helen Cameron was a widow and an orphan, with one beautiful\nboy, to whom she was left sole personal guardian, an income being\nsecured to her ample for her rank in life, but clogged with the one\ncondition of her not marrying again.\n\nSuch was the tenant, who, wearied of her dull suburban home, a red\nbrick house in the middle of a row of red brick houses; tired of the\nloneliness which never presses so much upon the spirits as when left\nsolitary in the environs of a great city; pining for country liberty,\nfor green trees, and fresh air; much caught by the picturesque-ness\nof Upton, and its mixture of old-fashioned stateliness and village\nrusticity; and, perhaps, a little swayed by a desire to be near an\nold friend and correspondent of the mother, to whose memory she was so\nstrongly attached, came in the budding spring time, the showery, flowery\nmonth of April, to spend the ensuing summer at the Court.\n\nWe, on our part, regarded her arrival with no common interest. To me\nit seemed but yesterday since I had received an epistle of thanks for\na present of one of dear Mary Howitt's charming children's books,--an\nepistle undoubtedly not indited by the writer,--in huge round text,\nbetween double pencil lines, with certain small errors of orthography\ncorrected in a smaller hand above; followed in due time by postscripts\nto her mother's letters, upon one single line, and the spelling much\namended; then by a short, very short note, in French; and at last, by a\ndespatch of unquestionable authenticity, all about doves and rabbits,--a\nholiday scrawl, rambling, scrambling, and uneven, and free from\nrestraint as heart could desire. It appeared but yesterday since Helen\nGraham was herself a child; and here she was, within two miles of us, a\nwidow and a mother!\n\nOur correspondence had been broken off by the death of Mrs. Graham when\nshe was about ten years old, and although I had twice called upon her\nin my casual visits to town during the lifetime of Mr. Cameron;\nand although these visits had been most punctually returned, it had\nhappened, as those things do happen in dear, provoking London, where one\nis sure to miss the people one wishes most to see, that neither party\nhad ever been at home; so that we had never met, and I was at full\nliberty to indulge in my foolish propensity of sketching in my mind's\neye a fancy portrait of my unknown friend.\n\nIl Penseroso is not more different from L'Allegro than was my\nanticipation from the charming reality. Remembering well her mother's\ndelicate and fragile grace of figure and countenance, and coupling with\nthat recollection her own unprotected and solitary state, and somewhat\nmelancholy story, I had pictured to myself (as if contrast were not in\nthis world of ours much more frequent than congruity) a mild, pensive,\ninteresting, fair-haired beauty, tall, pale, and slender;--I found\na Hebe, an Euphrosyne,--a round, rosy, joyous creature, the very\nimpersonation of youth, health, sweetness, and gaiety, laughter flashing\nfrom her hazel eyes, smiles dimpling round her coral lips, and the rich\ncurls of her chestnut hair,--for having been fourteen months a widow,\nshe had, of course, laid aside the peculiar dress,--the glossy ringlets\nof her \"bonny brown hair\" literally bursting from the comb that\nattempted to confine them.\n\nWe soon found that her mind was as charming as her person. Indeed, her\nface, lovely as it was, derived the best part of its loveliness from her\nsunny temper, her frank and ardent spirit, her affectionate and generous\nheart. It was the ever-varying expression, an expression which could\nnot deceive, that lent such matchless charms to her glowing and animated\ncountenance, and to the round and musical voice sweet as the spoken\nvoice of Malibran, or the still fuller and more exquisite tones of Mrs.\nJordan, which, true to the feeling of the moment, vibrated alike to the\nwildest gaiety and the deepest pathos. In a word, the chief beauty of\nHelen Cameron was her sensibility. It was the perfume to the rose.\n\nHer little boy, born just before his father's death, and upon whom she\ndoated, was a magnificent piece of still life. Calm, placid, dignified,\nan infant Hercules for strength and fair proportions, grave as a\njudge, quiet as a flower, he was, in point of age, exactly at that most\ndelightful period when children are very pleasant to look upon, and\nrequire no other sort of notice whatsoever. Of course this state of\nperfection could not be expected to continue. The young gentleman\nwould soon aspire to the accomplishments of walking and talking--and\nthen!--but as that hour of turmoil and commotion to which his mamma\nlooked forward with ecstacy was yet at some months distance, I contented\nmyself with saying of master Archy, with considerably less than the\nusual falsehood, that which everybody does say of only children, that he\nwas the finest baby that ever was seen.\n\nWe met almost every day. Mrs. Cameron was never weary of driving about\nour beautiful lanes in her little pony-carriage, and usually called upon\nus in her way home, we being not merely her oldest, but almost her only\nfriends; for lively and social as was her temper, there was a little\ntouch of shyness about her, which induced her rather to shun than to\ncovet the company of strangers. And indeed the cheerfulness of temper,\nand activity of mind, which made her so charming an acquisition to a\nsmall circle, rendered her independent of general society. Busy as a\nbee, sportive as a butterfly, she passed the greater part of her time\nin the open air, and having caught from me that very contagious and\nengrossing passion, a love of floriculture, had actually undertaken\nthe operation of restoring the old garden at the Court--a coppice of\nbrambles, thistles, and weeds of every description, mixed with flowering\nshrubs, and overgrown fruit-trees--to something like its original order.\nThe farmer, to be sure, had abandoned the job in despair, contenting\nhimself with growing his cabbages and potatoes in a field hard by. But\nshe was certain that she and her maid Martha, and the boy Bill, who\nlooked after her pony, would weed the paths, and fill the flower-borders\nin no time. We should see; I had need take good care of my reputation,\nfor she meant her garden to beat mine.\n\nWhat progress Helen and her forces, a shatter-brain boy who did not know\na violet from a nettle, and a London-bred girl who had hardly seen\na rose-bush in her life, would have made in clearing this forest of\nunderwood, might easily be foretold. Accident, however, that frequent\nfavourer of bold projects, came to her aid in the shape of a more\nefficient coadjutor.\n\nLate one evening the fair Helen arrived at our cottage with a face of\nunwonted gravity. Mrs. Davies (her landlady) had used her very ill.\nShe had taken the west wing in total ignorance of there being other\napartments to let at the Court, or she would have secured them. And now\na new lodger had arrived, had actually taken possession of two rooms\nin the centre of the house; and Martha, who had seen him, said he was a\nyoung man, and a handsome man--and she herself a young woman unprotected\nand alone!--It was awkward, very awkward! Was it not very awkward? What\nwas she to do?\n\nNothing could be done that night; so far was clear; but we praised her\nprudence, promised to call at Upton the next day, and if necessary, to\nspeak to this new lodger, who might, after all, be no very formidable\nperson; and quite relieved by the vent which she had given to her\nscruples, she departed in her usual good spirits.\n\nEarly the next morning she re-appeared. \"She would not have the new\nlodger disturbed for the world! He was a Pole. One doubtless of those\nunfortunate exiles. He had told Mrs. Davies that he was a Polish\ngentleman desirous chiefly of good air, cheapness, and retirement. Beyond\na doubt he was one of those unhappy fugitives. He looked grave, and\npale, and thoughtful, quite like a hero of romance. Besides, he was the\nvery person who a week before had caught hold of the reins when that\nlittle restive pony had taken fright at the baker's cart, and nearly\nbacked Bill and herself into the great gravel-pit on Lanton Common. Bill\nhad entirely lost all command over the pony, and but for the stranger's\npresence of mind, she did not know what would have become of them.\nSurely I must remember her telling me the circumstance? Besides, he was\nunfortunate! He was poor! He was an exile! She would not be the means of\ndriving him from the asylum which he had chosen for all the world!--No!\nnot for all my geraniums!\" an expression which is by no means the\nanti-climax that it seems--for in the eyes of a florist, and that\nflorist an enthusiast and a woman, what is this rusty fusty dusty musty\nbit of earth, called the world, compared to a stand of bright flowers?\n\nAnd finding, upon inquiry, that M. Choynowski (so he called himself) had\nbrought a letter of recommendation from a respectable London tradesman,\nand that there was every appearance of his being, as our fair young\nfriend had conjectured, a foreigner in distress, my father not only\nagreed that it would be a cruel attempt to drive him from his new\nhome, (a piece of tyranny which, even in this land of freedom, might,\nI suspect, have been managed in the form of an offer of double rent, by\nthat grand despot, money,) but resolved to offer the few attentions in\nour poor power, to one whom every look and word proclaimed him to be, in\nthe largest sense of the word, a gentleman.\n\nMy father had seen him, not on his visit of inquiry, but on a few\ndays after, bill-hook in hand, hacking away manfully at the briers and\nbrambles of the garden. My first view of him was in a position even\nless romantic, assisting a Belford tradesman to put up a stove in the\nnursery.\n\nOne of Mrs. Cameron's few causes of complaint in her country lodgings\nhad been the tendency to smoke in that important apartment. We all know\nthat when those two subtle essences, smoke and wind, once come to do\nbattle in a wide, open chimney, the invisible agent is pretty sure to\nhave the best of the day, and to drive his vapoury enemy at full speed\nbefore him. M. Choynowski, who by this time had established a gardening\nacquaintance, not merely with Bill and Martha, but with their fair\nmistress, happening to see her, one windy evening, in a paroxysm of\nsmoky distress, not merely recommended a stove, after the fashion of the\nnorthern nations' notions, but immediately walked into Belford to give\nhis own orders to a respectable ironmonger; and they were in the very\nact of erecting this admirable accessary to warmth and comfort (really\nthese words are synonymous) when I happened to call.\n\nI could hardly have seen him under circumstances better calculated\nto display his intelligence, his delicacy, or his good-breeding. The\npatience, gentleness, and kind feeling, with which he contrived at once\nto excuse and to remedy certain blunders made by the workmen in the\nexecution of his orders, and the clearness with which, in perfectly\ncorrect and idiomatic English, slightly tinged with a foreign accent, he\nexplained the mechanical and scientific reasons for the construction\nhe had suggested, gave evidence at once of no common talent, and of a\nconsiderate-ness and good-nature in its exercise more valuable than all\nthe talent in the world. If trifling and every-day occurrences afford,\nas I believe they do, the surest and safest indications of character, we\ncould have no hesitation in pronouncing upon the amiable qualities of M.\nChoynowski.\n\nIn person he was tall and graceful, and very noble-looking. His head\nwas particularly intellectual, and there was a calm sweetness about the\nmouth that was singularly prepossessing. Helen had likened him to a hero\nof romance. In my eyes he bore much more plainly the stamp of a man of\nfashion--of that very highest fashion which is too refined for finery,\ntoo full of self-respect for affectation. Simple, natural, mild,\nand gracious, the gentle reserve of his manner added, under the\ncircumstances, to the interest which he inspired. Somewhat of that\nreserve continued even after our acquaintance had ripened into intimacy.\n\nHe never spoke of his own past history, or future prospects, shunned\nall political discourse, and was with difficulty drawn into conversation\nupon the scenery and manners of the North of Europe. He seemed afraid of\nthe subject.\n\nUpon general topics, whether of literature or art, he was remarkably\nopen and candid. He possessed in an eminent degree the talent of\nacquiring languages for which his countrymen are distinguished, and had\nmade the best use of those keys of knowledge. I have never met with any\nperson whose mind was more richly cultivated, or who was more calculated\nto adorn the highest station. And here he was wasting life in a secluded\nvillage in a foreign country! What would become of him after his\npresent apparently slender resources should be exhausted, was painful\nto imagine. The more painful, that the accidental discovery of the\ndirection of a letter had disclosed his former rank. It was part of an\nenvelope addressed, \"A Monsieur Monsieur le Comte Choynowski,\" and left\nas a mark in a book, all except the name being torn off. But the fact\nneeded no confirmation. All his habits and ways of thinking bore marks\nof high station. What would become of him?\n\nIt was but too evident that another calamity was impending over the\nunfortunate exile. Although most discreet in word and guarded in manner,\nevery action bespoke his devotion to his lovely fellow inmate. Her\nwishes were his law. His attentions to her little boy were such as\nyoung men rarely show to infants except for love of the mother; and the\ngarden, that garden abandoned since the memory of man, (for the Court,\nprevious to the arrival of the present tenant, had been for years\nuninhabited,) was, under his exertions and superintendence, rapidly\nassuming an aspect of luxuriance and order. It was not impossible but\nHelen might realise her playful vaunt, and beat me in my own art after\nall.\n\nJohn (our gardening lad) was as near being jealous as possible, and,\nconsidering the estimation in which John is known to hold our doings in\nthe flower way, such jealousy must be accepted as the most flattering\ntestimony to his rival's success. To go beyond our garden was, in John's\nopinion, to be great indeed!\n\nEvery thought of the Count Choynowski was engrossed by the fair Helen;\nand we saw with some anxiety that she in her turn was but too sensible\nof his attentions, and that everything belonging to his country assumed\nin her eyes an absorbing importance. She sent to London for all the\nbooks that could be obtained respecting Poland; ordered all the journals\nthat interested themselves in that interesting though apparently\nhopeless cause; turned liberal,--she who had been reared in the lap\nof conservatism, and whom my father used laughingly to call the little\nTory;--turned Radical, turned Republican,--for she far out-soared the\nmoderate doctrines of whiggism in her political flights; denounced\nthe Emperor Nicholas as a tyrant; spoke of the Russians as a nation of\nsavages; and in spite of the evident uneasiness with which the Polish\nexile listened to any allusion to the wrongs of his country, for he\nnever mingled in such discussions, omitted no opportunity of proving her\nsympathy by declaiming with an animation and vehemence, as becoming\nas anything so like scolding well could be, against the cruelty and\nwickedness of the oppressors of that most unfortunate of nations.\n\nIt was clear that the peace of both was endangered, perhaps gone; and\nthat it had become the painful duty of friendship to awaken them from\ntheir too bewitching dream.\n\nWe had made an excursion, on one sunny summer's day, as far as the\nEverley Hills. Helen, always impassioned, had been wrought into a\npassionate recollection of her own native country, by the sight of the\nheather just bursting into its purple bloom; and M. Choynowski, usually\nso self-possessed, had been betrayed into the expression of a kindred\nfeeling by the delicious odour of the fir plantations, which served to\ntransport him in imagination to the balm-breathing forests of the North.\nThis sympathy was a new, and a strong bond of union between two spirits\nbut too congenial; and I determined no longer to defer informing the\ngentleman, in whose honour I placed the most implicit reliance, of the\npeculiar position of our fair friend.\n\nDetaining him, therefore, to coffee, (we had taken an early dinner in\nthe fir grove,) and suffering Helen to go home to her little boy,\nI contrived, by leading the conversation to capricious wills, to\ncommunicate to him, as if accidentally, the fact of her forfeiting her\nwhole income in the event of a second marriage.--He listened with grave\nattention.\n\n\"Is she also deprived,\" inquired he, \"of the guardianship of her\nchild?\"\n\n\"No. But as the sum allowed for the maintenance is also to cease from\nthe day of her nuptials, and the money to accumulate until he is of age,\nshe would, by marrying a poor man, do irreparable injury to her son, by\ncramping his education. It is a grievous restraint.\"\n\nHe made no answer. And after two or three attempts at conversation,\nwhich his mind was too completely pre-occupied to sustain, he bade us\ngood-night, and returned to the Court. The next morning we heard that\nhe had left Upton and gone, they said, to Oxford. And I could not help\nhoping that he had seen his danger, and would not return until the peril\nwas past.\n\nI was mistaken. In two or three days he returned, exhibiting less\nself-command than I had been led to anticipate. The fair lady, too, I\ntook occasion to remind of this terrible will, in hopes, since he would\nnot go, that she would have had the wisdom to have taken her departure.\nNo such thing; neither party would move a jot I might as well have\nbestowed my counsel upon the two stone figures on the great gateway. And\nheartily sorry, and a little angry, I resolved to let matters take their\nown course.\n\nSeveral weeks passed on, when one morning she came to me in the sweetest\nconfusion, the loveliest mixture of bashfulness and joy.\n\n\"He loves me!\" she said; \"he has told me that he loves me!\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"And I have referred him to you. That clause----\"\n\n\"He already knows it.\" And then I told her, word for word, what had\npassed.\n\n\"He knows of that clause, and he still wishes to marry me! He loves\nme for myself! Loves me, knowing me to be a beggar! It is true, pure,\ndisinterested affection!\"\n\n\"Beyond all doubt it is. And if you could live upon true love----\"\n\n\"Oh, but where _that_ exists, and youth, and health, and strength, and\neducation, may we not be well content to try to earn a living together?\nthink of the happiness comprised in that word! I could give\nlessons;--I am sure that I could. I would teach music, and drawing,\nand dancing--anything for him! or we could keep a school here at\nUpton--anywhere with him!\"\n\n\"And I am to tell him this?\"\n\n\"Not the words!\" replied she, blushing like a rose at her own\nearnestness; \"not those words!\"\n\nOf course, it was not very long before M. le Comte made his appearance.\n\n\"God bless her, noble, generous creature!\" cried he, when I had\nfulfilled my commission. \"God for ever bless her!\"\n\n\"And you intend, then, to take her at her word, and set up school\ntogether?\" exclaimed I, a little provoked at his unscrupulous acceptance\nof her proffered sacrifice. \"You really intend to keep a lady's\nboarding-school here at the Court?\"\n\n\"I intend to take her at her word, most certainly,\" replied he, very\ncomposedly; \"but I should like to know, my good friend, what has put it\ninto her head, and into yours, that if Helen marries me she must needs\nearn her own living? Suppose I should tell you,\" continued he, smiling,\n\"that my father, one of the richest of the Polish nobility, was a\nfavourite friend of the Emperor Alexander; that the Emperor Nicholas\ncontinued to me the kindness which his brother had shown to my father,\nand that I thought, as he had done, (gratitude and personal attachment\napart,) that I could better serve my country, and more effectually\nameliorate the condition of my tenants and vassals, by submitting to\nthe Russian government, than by a hopeless struggle for national\nindependence? Suppose that I were to confess, that chancing in the\ncourse of a three-years' travel to walk through this pretty village\nof yours, I saw Helen, and could not rest until I had seen more of\nher;--supposing all this, would you pardon the deception, or rather the\nallowing you to deceive yourselves? Oh, if you could but imagine how\ndelightful it is to a man, upon whom the humbling conviction has been\nforced, that his society is courted and his alliance sought for the\naccidents of rank and fortune, to feel that he is, for once in his life,\nhonestly liked, fervently loved for himself, such as he is, his own very\nself,--if you could but fancy how proud he is of such friendship, how\nhappy in such love, you would pardon him, I am sure you would; you would\nnever have the heart to be angry. And now that the Imperial consent to\na foreign union--the gracious consent for which I so anxiously waited to\nauthorize my proposals--has at length arrived, do you think,\" added the\nCount, with some seriousness, \"that there is any chance of reconciling\nthis dear Helen to my august master? or will she still continue a\nrebel?\"\n\nAt this question, so gravely put, I laughed outright \"Why really, my\ndear Count, I cannot pretend to answer decidedly for the turn that\nthe affair might take; but my impression--to speak in that idiomatic\nEnglish, more racy than elegant, which you pique yourself upon\nunderstanding--my full impression is, that Helen having for no reason\nupon earth but her interest in you, _ratted_ from Conservatism to\nRadicalism, will for the same cause lose no time in ratting back again.\nA woman's politics, especially if she be a young woman, are generally\nthe result of feeling rather than of opinion, and our fair friend\nstrikes me as a most unlikely subject to form an exception to the rule.\nHowever, if you doubt my authority in this matter, you have nothing to\ndo but to inquire at the fountain-head. There she sits, in the arbour.\nGo and ask.\"\n\nAnd before the words were well spoken, the lover, radiant with\nhappiness, was at the side of his beloved.",
