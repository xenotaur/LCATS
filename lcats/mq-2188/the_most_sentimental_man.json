    "body": "Johnson went to see the others off at Idlewild. He knew they'd expect\nhim to and, since it would be the last conventional gesture he'd have to\nmake, he might as well conform to their notions of what was right and\nproper.\n\nFor the past few centuries the climate had been getting hotter; now,\neven though it was not yet June, the day was uncomfortably warm. The\nsun's rays glinting off the bright metal flanks of the ship dazzled his\neyes, and perspiration made his shirt stick to his shoulder blades\nbeneath the jacket that the formality of the occasion had required. He\nwished Clifford would hurry up and get the leave-taking over with.\n\nBut, even though Clifford was undoubtedly even more anxious than he to\nfinish with all this ceremony and take off, he wasn't the kind of man to\nlet inclination influence his actions. \"Sure you won't change your mind\nand come with us?\"\n\nJohnson shook his head.\n\nThe young man looked at him--hatred for the older man's complication of\nwhat should have been a simple departure showing through the pellicule\nof politeness. He was young for, since this trip had only slight\nhistorical importance and none of any other kind, the authorities had\nfelt a junior officer entirely sufficient. It was clear, however, that\nClifford attributed his commandership to his merits, and he was very\nconscious of his great responsibility.\n\n\"We have plenty of room on the ship,\" he persisted. \"There weren't many\nleft to go. We could take you easily enough, you know.\"\n\nJohnson made a negative sign again. The rays of the sun beating full\nupon his head made apparent the grey that usually blended into the\nstill-thick blond hair. Yet, though past youth, he was far from being an\nold man. \"I've made my decision,\" he said, remembering that anger now\nwas pointless.\n\n\"If it's--if you're just too proud to change your mind,\" the young\ncommander said, less certainly, \"I'm sure everyone will understand\nif ... if ...\"\n\nJohnson smiled. \"No, it's just that I want to stay--that's all.\"\n\nBut the commander's clear blue eyes were still baffled, uneasy, as\nthough he felt he had not done the utmost that duty--not duty to the\nservice but to humanity--required. That was the trouble with people,\nJohnson thought: when they were most well-meaning they became most\ntroublesome.\n\nClifford lowered his voice to an appropriately funeral hush, as a fresh\nthought obviously struck him. \"I know, of course, that your loved ones\nare buried here and perhaps you feel it's your duty to stay with\nthem...?\"\n\nAt this Johnson almost forgot that anger no longer had any validity. By\n\"loved ones\" Clifford undoubtedly had meant Elinor and Paul. It was true\nthat Johnson had had a certain affection for his wife and son when they\nwere alive; now that they were dead they represented an episode in his\nlife that had not, perhaps, been unpleasant, but was certainly over and\ndone with now.\n\nDid Clifford think _that_ was his reason for remaining? Why, he must\nbelieve Johnson to be the most sentimental man on Earth. \"And, come to\nthink of it,\" Johnson said to himself, amused, \"I am--or soon will\nbe--just that.\"\n\nThe commander was still unconsciously pursuing the same train of\nthought. \"It does seem incredible,\" he said in a burst of boyish candor\nthat did not become him, for he was not that young, \"that you'd want to\nstay alone on a whole planet. I mean to say--entirely alone.... There'll\nnever be another ship, you know--at least not in your lifetime.\"\n\nJohnson knew what the other man was thinking. If there'd been a woman\nwith Johnson now, Clifford might have been able to understand a little\nbetter how the other could stick by his decision.\n\nJohnson wriggled, as sweat oozed stickily down his back. \"For God's\nsake,\" he said silently, \"take your silly ship and get the hell off my\nplanet.\" Aloud he said, \"It's a good planet, a little worn-out but still\nin pretty good shape. Pity you can't trade in an old world like an old\ncar, isn't it?\"\n\n\"If it weren't so damned far from the center of things,\" the young man\nreplied, defensively assuming the burden of all civilization, \"we\nwouldn't abandon it. After all, we hate leaving the world on which we\noriginated. But it's a long haul to Alpha Centauri--you know that--and a\ntremendously expensive one. Keeping up this place solely out of\nsentiment would be sheer waste--the people would never stand for the tax\nburden.\"\n\n\"A costly museum, yes,\" Johnson agreed.\n\nHow much longer were these dismal farewells going to continue? How much\nlonger would the young man still feel the need to justify himself? \"If\nonly there were others fool enough--if only there were others with\nyou.... But, even if anybody else'd be willing to cut himself off\nentirely from the rest of the civilized universe, the Earth won't\nsupport enough of a population to keep it running. Not according to our\npresent living standards anyway.... Most of its resources are gone, you\nknow--hardly any coal or oil left, and that's not worth digging for when\nthere are better and cheaper fuels in the system.\"\n\nHe was virtually quoting from the _Colonial Officer's Manual_. Were\nthere any people left able to think for themselves, Johnson wondered.\nHad there ever been? Had he thought for himself in making his decision,\nor was he merely clinging to a childish dream that all men had had and\nlost?\n\n\"With man gone, Earth will replenish herself,\" he said aloud. First the\nvegetation would begin to grow thick. Already it had released itself\nfrom the restraint of cultivation; soon it would be spreading out over\nthe continent, overrunning the cities with delicately persistent green\ntendrils. Some the harsh winters would kill, but others would live on\nand would multiply. Vines would twist themselves about the tall\nbuildings and tenderly, passionately squeeze them to death ...\neventually send them tumbling down. And then the trees would rear\nthemselves in their places.\n\nThe swamps that man had filled in would begin to reappear one by one, as\nthe land sank back to a pristine state. The sea would go on changing\nher boundaries, with no dikes to stop her. Volcanoes would heave up the\nland into different configurations. The heat would increase until it\ngrew unbearable ... only there would be no one--no human, anyway--to\nbear it.\n\nYear after year the leaves would wither and fall and decay. Rock would\ncover them. And some day ... billions of years thence ... there would be\ncoal and oil--and nobody to want them.\n\n\"Very likely Earth will replenish herself,\" the commander agreed, \"but\nnot in your time or your children's time.... That is, not in _my_\nchildren's time,\" he added hastily.\n\nThe handful of men lined up in a row before the airlock shuffled their\nfeet and allowed their muttering to become a few decibels louder.\nClifford looked at his wrist chronometer. Obviously he was no less\nanxious than the crew to be off, but, for the sake of his conscience, he\nmust make a last try.\n\n\"Damn your conscience,\" Johnson thought. \"I hope that for this you feel\nguilty as hell, that you wake up nights in a cold sweat remembering that\nyou left one man alone on the planet you and your kind discarded. Not\nthat I don't want to stay, mind you, but that I want you to suffer the\nway you're making me suffer now--having to listen to your platitudes.\"\n\nThe commander suddenly stopped paraphrasing the _Manual_. \"Camping out's\nfun for a week or two, you know, but it's different when it's for a\nlifetime.\"\n\nJohnson's fingers curled in his palms ... he was even angrier now that\nthe commander had struck so close to home. Camping out ... was that all\nhe was doing--fulfilling childhood desires, nothing more?\n\nFortunately Clifford didn't realize that he had scored, and scuttled\nback to the shelter of the _Manual_. \"Perhaps you don't know enough\nabout the new system in Alpha Centauri,\" he said, a trifle wildly. \"It\nhas two suns surrounded by three planets, Thalia, Aglaia, and\nEuphrosyne. Each of these planets is slightly smaller than Earth, so\nthat the decrease in gravity is just great enough to be pleasant,\nwithout being so marked as to be inconvenient. The atmosphere is almost\nexactly like that of Earth's, except that it contains several beneficial\nelements which are absent here--and the climate is more temperate. Owing\nto the fact that the planets are partially shielded from the suns by\ncloud layers, the temperature--except immediately at the poles and the\nequators, where it is slightly more extreme--is always equable,\nresembling that of Southern California....\"\n\n\"Sounds charming,\" said Johnson. \"I too have read the Colonial Office\nhandouts.... I wonder what the people who wrote them'll do now that\nthere's no longer any necessity for attracting colonists--everybody's\nalready up in Alpha Centauri. Oh, well; there'll be other systems to\nconquer and colonize.\"\n\n\"The word _conquer_ is hardly correct,\" the commander said stiffly,\n\"since not one of the three planets had any indigenous life forms that\nwas intelligent.\"\n\n\"Or life forms that you recognized as intelligent,\" Johnson suggested\ngently. Although why should there be such a premium placed on\nintelligence, he wondered. Was intelligence the sole criterion on which\nthe right to life and to freedom should be based?\n\nThe commander frowned and looked at his chronometer again. \"Well,\" he\nfinally said, \"since you feel that way and you're sure you've quite made\nup your mind, my men _are_ anxious to go.\"\n\n\"Of course they are,\" Johnson said, managing to convey just the right\namount of reproach.\n\nClifford flushed and started to walk away.\n\n\"I'll stand out of the way of your jets!\" Johnson called after him. \"It\nwould be so anticlimactic to have me burned to a crisp after all this.\nBon voyage!\"\n\nThere was no reply.\n\nJohnson watched the silver vessel shoot up into the sky and thought,\n\"Now is the time for me to feel a pang, or even a twinge, but I don't at\nall. I feel relieved, in fact, but that's probably the result of getting\nrid of that fool Clifford.\"\n\nHe crossed the field briskly, pulling off his jacket and discarding his\ntie as he went. His ground car remained where he had parked it--in an\narea clearly marked _No Parking_.\n\nThey'd left him an old car that wasn't worth shipping to the stars. How\nlong it would last was anybody's guess. The government hadn't been\ndeliberately illiberal in leaving him such a shabby vehicle; if there\nhad been any way to ensure a continuing supply of fuel, they would\nprobably have left him a reasonably good one. But, since only a little\ncould be left, allowing him a good car would have been simply an example\nof conspicuous waste, and the government had always preferred its waste\nto be inconspicuous.\n\nHe drove slowly through the broad boulevards of Long Island, savoring\nthe loneliness. New York as a residential area had been a ghost town for\nyears, since the greater part of its citizens had been among the first\nto emigrate to the stars. However, since it was the capital of the world\nand most of the interstellar ships--particularly the last few--had\ntaken off from its spaceports, it had been kept up as an official\nembarkation center. Thus, paradoxically, it was the last city to be\ncompletely evacuated, and so, although the massive but jerry-built\napartment houses that lined the streets were already crumbling, the\nroads had been kept in fairly good shape and were hardly cracked at all.\n\nStill, here and there the green was pushing its way up in unlikely\nplaces. A few more of New York's tropical summers, and Long Island would\nsoon become a wilderness.\n\nThe streets were empty, except for the cats sunning themselves on\nlong-abandoned doorsteps or padding about on obscure errands of their\nown. Perhaps their numbers had not increased since humanity had left the\ncity to them, but there certainly seemed to be more--striped and solid,\nblack and grey and white and tawny--accepting their citizenship with\nequanimity. They paid no attention to Johnson--they had long since\ndissociated themselves from a humanity that had not concerned itself\ngreatly over their welfare. On the other hand, neither he nor the\nsurface car appeared to startle them; the old ones had seen such before,\nand to kittens the very fact of existence is the ultimate surprise.\n\nThe Queensborough Bridge was deadly silent. It was completely empty\nexcept for a calico cat moving purposefully toward Manhattan. The\nstructure needed a coat of paint, Johnson thought vaguely, but of course\nit would never get one. Still, even uncared for, the bridges should\noutlast him--there would be no heavy traffic to weaken them. Just in\ncase of unforeseeable catastrophe, however--he didn't want to be trapped\non an island, even Manhattan Island--he had remembered to provide\nhimself with a rowboat; a motorboat would have been preferable, but then\nthe fuel difficulty would arise again....\n\nHow empty the East River looked without any craft on it! It was rather a\ncharming little waterway in its own right, though nothing to compare\nwith the stately Hudson. The water scintillated in the sunshine and the\nair was clear and fresh, for no factories had spewed fumes and smoke\ninto it for many years. There were few gulls, for nothing was left for\nthe scavenger; those remaining were forced to make an honest living by\ncatching fish.\n\nIn Manhattan, where the buildings had been more soundly constructed, the\nsigns of abandonment were less evident ... empty streets, an occasional\ncracked window. Not even an unusual amount of dirt because, in the\npast, the normal activities of an industrial and ruggedly individual\ncity had provided more grime than years of neglect could ever hope to\nequal. No, it would take Manhattan longer to go back than Long Island.\nPerhaps that too would not happen during his lifetime.\n\nYet, after all, when he reached Fifth Avenue he found that Central Park\nhad burst its boundaries. Fifty-ninth Street was already half jungle,\nand the lush growth spilled down the avenues and spread raggedly out\ninto the side streets, pushing its way up through the cracks it had made\nin the surface of the roads. Although the Plaza fountain had not flowed\nfor centuries, water had collected in the leaf-choked basin from the\nlast rain, and a group of grey squirrels were gathered around it,\nshrilly disputing possession with some starlings.\n\nExcept for the occasional cry of a cat in the distance, these voices\nwere all that he heard ... the only sound. Not even the sudden blast of\na jet regaining power ... he would never hear that again; never hear the\nstridor of a human voice piercing with anger; the cacophony of a hundred\ntelevision sets, each playing a different program; the hoot of a horn;\noff-key singing; the thin, uncertain notes of an amateur musician ...\nthese would never be heard on Earth again.\n\nHe sent the car gliding slowly ... no more traffic rules ... down Fifth\nAvenue. The buildings here also were well-built; they were many\ncenturies old and would probably last as many more. The shop windows\nwere empty, except for tangles of dust ... an occasional broken,\ndiscarded mannequin.... In some instances the glass had already cracked\nor fallen out. Since there were no children to throw stones, however,\nothers might last indefinitely, carefully glassing in nothingness. Doors\nstood open and he could see rows of empty counters and barren shelves\nfuzzed high with the dust of the years since a customer had approached\nthem.\n\nCats sedately walked up and down the avenue or sat genteelly with tails\ntucked in on the steps of the cathedral--as if the place had been theirs\nall along.\n\nDusk was falling. Tonight, for the first time in centuries, the street\nlamps would not go on. Undoubtedly when it grew dark he would see\nghosts, but they would be the ghosts of the past and he had made his\npeace with the past long since; it was the present and the future with\nwhich he had not come to terms. And now there would be no present, no\npast, no future--but all merged into one and he was the only one.\n\nAt Forty-second Street pigeons fluttered thickly around the public\nlibrary, fat as ever, their numbers greater, their appetites grosser.\nThe ancient library, he knew, had changed little inside: stacks and\nshelves would still be packed thick with reading matter. Books are\nbulky, so only the rare editions had been taken beyond the stars; the\nrest had been microfilmed and their originals left to Johnson and decay.\nIt was his library now, and he had all the time in the world to read all\nthe books in the world--for there were more than he could possibly read\nin the years that, even at the most generous estimate, were left to him.\n\nHe had been wondering where to make his permanent residence for, with\nthe whole world his, he would be a fool to confine himself to some\nmodest dwelling. Now he fancied it might be a good idea to move right\ninto the library. Very few places in Manhattan could boast a garden of\ntheir own.\n\nHe stopped the car to stare thoughtfully at the little park behind the\ngrimy monument to Neoclassicism. Like Central Park, Bryant had already\nslipped its boundaries and encroached upon Sixth Avenue--Avenue of the\nWorld, the street signs said now, and before that it had been Avenue of\nthe Nations and Avenue of the Americas, but to the public it had always\nbeen Sixth Avenue and to Johnson, the last man on Earth, it was Sixth\nAvenue.\n\nHe'd live in the library, while he stayed in New York, that was--he'd\nthought that in a few weeks, when it got really hot, he might strike\nnorth. He had always meant to spend a summer in Canada. His surface car\nwould probably never last the trip, but the Museum of Ancient Vehicles\nhad been glad to bestow half a dozen of the bicycles from their exhibits\nupon him. After all, he was, in effect, a museum piece himself and so as\nworth preserving as the bicycles; moreover, bicycles are difficult to\npack for an interstellar trip. With reasonable care, these might last\nhim his lifetime....\n\nBut he had to have a permanent residence somewhere, and the library was\nan elegant and commodious dwelling, centrally located. New York would\nhave to be his headquarters, for all the possessions he had carefully\namassed and collected and begged and--since money would do him no good\nany more--bought, were here. And there were by far too many of them to\nbe transported to any really distant location. He loved to own things.\n\nHe was by no means an advocate of Rousseau's complete return to nature;\nwhatever civilization had left that he could use without compromise, he\nwould--and thankfully. There would be no electricity, of course, but he\nhad provided himself with flashlights and bulbs and batteries--not too\nmany of the last, of course, because they'd grow stale. However, he'd\nalso laid in plenty of candles and a vast supply of matches.... Tins of\nfood and concentrates and synthetics, packages of seed should he grow\ntired of all these and want to try growing his own--fruit, he knew,\nwould be growing wild soon enough.... Vitamins and medicines--of course,\nwere he to get really ill or get hurt in some way, it might be the end\n... but that was something he wouldn't think of--something that couldn't\npossibly happen to him....\n\nFor his relaxation he had an antique hand-wound phonograph, together\nwith thousands of old-fashioned records. And then, of course, he had the\nwhole planet, the whole world to amuse him.\n\nHe even had provided himself with a heat-ray gun and a substantial\nsupply of ammunition, although he couldn't imagine himself ever killing\nan animal for food. It was squeamishness that stood in his way rather\nthan any ethical considerations, although he did indeed believe that\nevery creature had the right to live. Nonetheless, there was the\npossibility that the craving for fresh meat might change his mind for\nhim. Besides, although hostile animals had long been gone from this part\nof the world--the only animals would be birds and squirrels and, farther\nup the Hudson, rabbits and chipmunks and deer ... perhaps an occasional\nbear in the mountains--who knew what harmless life form might become a\nthreat now that its development would be left unchecked?\n\nA cat sitting atop one of the stately stone lions outside the library\nmet his eye with such a steady gaze of understanding, though not of\nsympathy, that he found himself needing to repeat the by-now almost\nmagic phrase to himself: \"Not in my lifetime anyway.\" Would some\nintelligent life form develop to supplant man? Or would the planet\nrevert to a primeval state of mindless innocence? He would never know\nand he didn't really care ... no point in speculating over unanswerable\nquestions.\n\nHe settled back luxuriously on the worn cushions of his car. Even so\nlittle as twenty years before, it would have been impossible for\nhim--for anyone--to stop his vehicle in the middle of Forty-second\nStreet and Fifth Avenue purely to meditate. But it was his domain now.\nHe could go in the wrong direction on one-way streets, stop wherever he\npleased, drive as fast or as slowly as he would (and could, of course).\nIf he wanted to do anything as vulgar as spit in the street, he could\n(but they were his streets now, not to be sullied) ... cross the roads\nwithout waiting for the lights to change (it would be a long, long wait\nif he did) ... go to sleep when he wanted, eat as many meals as he\nwanted whenever he chose.... He could go naked in hot weather and\nthere'd be no one to raise an eyebrow, deface public buildings (except\nthat they were private buildings now, his buildings), idle without the\nguilty feeling that there was always something better he could and\nshould be doing ... even if there were not. There would be no more\nguilty feelings; without people and their knowledge there was no more\nguilt.\n\nA flash of movement in the bushes behind the library caught his eye.\nSurely that couldn't be a fawn in Bryant Park? So soon?... He'd thought\nit would be another ten years at least before the wild animals came\nsniffing timidly along the Hudson, venturing a little further each time\nthey saw no sign of their age-old enemy.\n\nBut probably the deer was only his imagination. He would investigate\nfurther after he had moved into the library.\n\nPerhaps a higher building than the library.... But then he would have to\nclimb too many flights of stairs. The elevators wouldn't be working ...\nsilly of him to forget that. There were a lot of steps outside the\nlibrary too--it would be a chore to get his bicycles up those steps.\n\nThen he smiled to himself. Robinson Crusoe would have been glad to have\nhad bicycles and steps and such relatively harmless animals as bears to\nworry about. No, Robinson Crusoe never had it so good as he, Johnson,\nwould have, and what more could he want?\n\nFor, whoever before in history had had his dreams--and what was wrong\nwith dreams, after all?--so completely gratified? What child,\nenvisioning a desert island all his own could imagine that his island\nwould be the whole world? Together Johnson and the Earth would grow\nyoung again.\n\nNo, the stars were for others. Johnson was not the first man in history\nwho had wanted the Earth, but he had been the first man--and probably\nthe last--who had actually been given it. And he was well content with\nhis bargain.\n\nThere was plenty of room for the bears too.\n\n",
