how I long that land to see.\n\n              I fain would leave this world of woe,\n              And to that happy land I\u2019d go;\n              I\u2019d bid adieu to earthly ties\n              And reign with Him beyond the skies.\n\n              Who made this world, the shining sun,\n              And bid the stars their courses run?\n              Who formed the land, who made the trees,\n              The mighty oceans and the seas?\n\n              Who reared the mountains crowned in green,\n              The winding rivers roll between;\n              And all that\u2019s seen by human eyes,\n              And all beyond the bright blue skies?\n\n              Who scattered countless worlds through space\n              To onward plod their weary race,\n              Till God shall stand on sea and shore,\n              Declaring time shall be no more?\n\n              Oh! great Jehovah, faithful friend,\n              On Thee our fainting souls depend;\n              Guide us with unerring eye,\n              To realms of bliss beyond the sky.\n\n              Beautiful land, enchanted land,\n              Where angels to me beckoning stand,\n              To call me from this earth away\n              To reign with Christ in endless day.\n\n              By faith I see that happy land,\n              The vacant seat at Christ\u2019s right hand;\n              The place that waits me till I rise\n              To reign with Him beyond the skies.\n\n              By faith those pearly gates I see,\n              Those gates stand open wide for me;\n              The angels there in waiting stand\n              To pass me to that happy land.\n\n              The dear ones in that happy land,\n              Methinks I see them hand in hand;\n              A sister and a darling boy,\n              And oh! it thrills my soul with joy\u2014\n\n              To think of meeting them again,\n              Beyond this world of care and pain;\n              Glorious anthems there will rise,\n              When I get home beyond the skies.\n\n              Beautiful land, land of light,\n              The angels robed in pearly white;\n              My very soul within me sighs,\n              To gain that land beyond the skies.\n\n              No troubles there will mar our peace,\n              Our pleasures there will never cease;\n              No tears of grief will dim our eyes,\n              In that bright land beyond the skies.\n\n              Beautiful land with streets of gold,\n              Thy splendors half can ne\u2019er be told;\n              When shall my soul to thee arise\u2014\n              Jehovah\u2019s throne beyond the skies.\n\n              This life is but a troubled dream;\n              When shall I cross cold Jordan\u2019s stream?\n              Oh! hasten death, my soul replies,\n              To waft me home beyond the skies.\n\n\n\n\n                                A PRAYER\n\n\n                O Lord, our Father, hear us now,\n                While on our bended knees we bow;\n                Look down, O Lord, in tender love,\n                Prepare us all to meet above.\n\n                O Lord, our Father, hear us pray,\n                Watch over us from day to day;\n                Hear us in our humble prayer,\n                O keep us safely in Thy care.\n\n                O help us, Lord, to pray aright,\n                And keep us holy in Thy sight;\n                Protect us with Thy mighty arm\n                And keep us from temptation\u2019s harm.\n\n                Bless and make us pure within,\n                Wash us, cleanse us free from sin;\n                Protect us with Thy mighty hand,\n                Prepare us for the promised land.\n\n                O Lord, come down in mighty power,\n                Revive us all this very hour;\n                O lift us from this pit of mire,\n                And fill our souls with heavenly fire.\n\n                Come with love\u2019s refreshing showers,\n                And kindle these cold hearts of ours;\n                O guide us in the narrow path,\n                Lord save us from Thy coming wrath.\n\n                And when we leave this world of strife\n                O give us all eternal life;\n                Arm us, Lord, with wings of love,\n                To leave this world and fly above.\n\n                Into Thy care, O Lord, we leave,\n                In peace, O Lord, our souls receive;\n                We ask it all, O Lord, we may,\n                Through Him Who taught us all to say:\n\n                Our Father, Who art in heaven, we pray,\n                Hallowed be Thy name this day;\n                Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,\n                In earth and up in heaven as one.\n\n                Give us this day our daily bread,\n                \u2019Tis from Thy bounties all are fed;\n                Our trespasses, O Lord, forgive,\n                As we our trespassers forgive.\n\n                Dear Lord, with tempters leave us not,\n                Deliver us from evil\u2019s plot;\n                Thy name shall have the glory then,\n                Forever and for aye.
