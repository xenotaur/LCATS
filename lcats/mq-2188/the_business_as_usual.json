While this was\nthe occasion for much rejoicing among the Defense Department members\nwho were cleared for Top Secret, this national-defense solution merely\nposed a greater problem: What should we do with it?\n\n\"There must,\" said the Secretary of Defense, \"be some utilization of\nthis new device to demonstrate to 'Certain Powers' that the world can\nbe made safe for Freedom and Democracy!\"\n\n\"'Certain Powers,' my foot,\" said the President. \"Why don't we ever\ncome out and just say it?\"\n\n\"Policy,\" the Secretary said. \"We've always walked softly in our\nForeign Policy; especially softly in cases where we didn't have the\n'big stick' to carry.\"\n\n\"Well,\" grumbled the President, \"we've got the big stick now. What do\nwe do with it?\"\n\n\"We just want to shake it a bit,\" said the Secretary. \"No contusions\nintended, of course. We just have to let them know we _have_ it, but\nare too kind-hearted to use it. Unless provoked, naturally.\"\n\n\"I can see,\" said the President, \"that this new plane is burning a hole\nin your pocket. Suppose we do send it flying over Rus--\"\n\n\"_Mister_ President!\" said the Secretary of Defense.\n\nThe President sighed. \"All right, all right. Flying over 'Certain\nAreas,' then. Let's say we get it there. Fine. What do we do with it?\nDrop leaflets?\"\n\n\"No. That comes under the proselytizing clause in the Geneva Conference\nof '59.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose a small--well, you know.\"\n\n\"Aggression,\" said the Secretary. \"We'd lose face in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"So?\" demanded the President, spreading his hands. \"They don't like us\nanyhow, do they? Or the competition--or each other, for that matter.\"\n\n\"That's not the point. We have to _feel_ as though our dollars are\nbuying friends, whether or not it's true.\"\n\n\"Well, then, what _can_ we do?\" said the President. \"No leaflets, no\naggression. We couldn't maybe seed their clouds and make it rain on\nthem?\"\n\n\"And get sued by other countries for artificially creating low-pressure\nconditions that, they could claim, robbed them of their rightful\nrainfall? We've had it happen right here between our own states.\"\n\n\"Maybe we should just forget about it, then?\"\n\n\"Never! It must be demonstrated to the world that--\"\n\n\"We could take a full-page ad in the New York _Times_.\"\n\n\"It just isn't done that way,\" the Secretary protested.\n\n\"Why not? It'd save money, wouldn't it? A simple ad like, '_Hey, there,\nCertain Powers! Lookie what we got!_' What'd be wrong with that?\"\n\n\"They'd accuse us of Capitalistic Propaganda, that's what! And to get\nthe egg off our face, we'd have to demonstrate the plane and--\"\n\n\"And be right back where we are now,\" the President realized aloud,\nnodding gloomily. \"Okay, so what do we do?\"\n\nThe Secretary looked to left and right, although they were alone\ntogether in a soundproofed, heavily guarded room, before replying.\n\n\"We drop an agent!\" he whispered.\n\n<tb>\n\nThe President blinked twice before responding. \"Have you gone mad?\nWhat man in his right mind would volunteer for such a thing? 'Drop\nan agent,' indeed! Ten minutes after landing, he'd be up against a\nwall and shot. Wouldn't _that_ be lovely for Freedom and Democracy?\nWe'd have the R--the Certain Powers gloating over the air waves for\nweeks about nipping a Capitalist Assassination Plot in the bud, not\nto mention the Mothers of America beating down the White House door\nbecause one of Our Boys was sacrificed. You know how our country\nreacts: If an entire division is wiped out, we bite the bullet and\nerect statues and make speeches and then forget it. But let a single\nman get in dutch and the whole populace goes crazy until something is\n'done' about it. No, it won't work.\"\n\n\"May I finish?\" said the Secretary patiently.\n\nThe President shrugged. \"Why not?\"\n\n\"This agent would be something special, sir. One that would not only\ndemonstrate our new aircraft, but which would positively leave the\nR--damn, you've got _me_ doing it!--Certain Powers tied in knots. In\npoint of fact, our military psychologists think that this agent might\nbe the wedge to split Communism apart in hopeless panic!\"\n\n\"Really?\" the President said, with more enthusiasm than he had shown\nthroughout the entire meeting. \"I'd like to meet this agent.\"\n\nThe Secretary pressed a black button upon the conference table. An\ninstant later, the door opened and the Secretary's personal aide\nstepped in. \"Yes, sir?\"\n\n\"Jenkins, have the corridor cleared and Secret Service men posted at\nall entrances and exits. When it's safe, bring in Agent X-45.\" He\npaused. \"And Professor Blake, too.\"\n\n\"At once, sir.\" Jenkins hurried out.\n\n\"X-45?\" said the President. \"Has he no name?\"\n\nThe Secretary smiled inscrutably. \"Teddy, sir.\"\n\n\"Why that smirk?\"\n\n\"You'll see, sir.\"\n\nThey sat in fidgety silence for another minute, and then a buzzer\nsounded, twice.\n\n\"Ah, that's Jenkins,\" said the Secretary, and pressed the button once\nmore.\n\nJenkins came in, followed by a tall gray-haired man who carried a large\nblack suitcase. The President arose, and, as Jenkins left the room\nagain, shook hands with the man. \"Agent X-45?\" he asked.\n\n\"Professor Charles Blake,\" the man corrected him calmly. \"Agent X-45 is\nin here.\"\n\nThe President stared. \"In the _suitcase_? What are we sending? A\n_dwarf_?\"\n\n\"Hardly,\" said the Secretary, snapping up the hasps on the suitcase\nand opening it upon the table. \"This,\" he said, lifting something from\nunder tissue-paper padding, \"is Agent X-45.\"\n\nThe President's gaze was returned by two shiny black eyes, set on\neither side of a little brown muzzle with a gentle, stitched-on smile.\nAgent X-45 was clad in flight helmet, miniature jacket and tiny boots,\nwith a baggy pair of brown canvas trousers belted at the waist with\na bandolier holding a dozen small wooden bullets, and dangling a\npatent-leather holster containing a plastic water pistol. And he wore a\nsmall parachute and harness.\n\n\"But that's a teddy bear!\" cried the President.\n\n\"Precisely,\" Professor Blake said.\n\n<tb>\n\n\"I think I'll sit down,\" said the President, and did so, visibly\nlooking like a man who believes he is surrounded by lunatics.\n\n\"And look here!\" said the Secretary, slipping his hand within Teddy's\njacket and withdrawing a small oilskin pouch. \"It's rather rudimentary,\nbut the Cyrillic lettering is genuine, and our ambassador assures us\nthe layout is correct.\"\n\nThe President took the pouch, unfolded it and drew out a small sheet\nof paper, covered with the inscrutable letterings, and numerous\nrectangles and curving red lines.\n\n\"I give up,\" he said. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"A map of the Kremlin,\" said the Secretary, his eyes dancing. \"That big\nred 'X' is the location of the Politburo Council Chamber.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" the President said weakly, \"you could explain...?\"\n\n\"Mister President,\" said Professor Blake, \"I am the new Chief of\nPropaganda for the government.\"\n\nThe President nodded, poured himself a glass of water from a pitcher\nand drained it. \"Yes, yes?\" he said.\n\n\"Naturally, I have spent my career studying the psychology of a Certain\nPower....\"\n\nThe President groaned. \"Please, gentlemen, let's name names! It need\nnever go outside this room. _My_ lips are sealed!\"\n\nThe professor and the Secretary exchanged a look, a raising of\neyebrows, then a shrug of surrender.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Blake. \"Russia--\"\n\n\"There,\" said the President. \"That's more like it.\"\n\nBlake cleared his throat and went on.\n\n\"We know the weak spot in the Russian armor is the mentality of the\naverage Communist official,\" he explained, while the Secretary, who\nhad heard this all before, fiddled with the straps of Teddy's parachute\nand hummed softly to himself. \"They have a distrust complex. Everything\nand everybody is under 24-hour-a-day suspicion.\"\n\n\"Yes, so I hear,\" said the President.\n\n\"What do you suppose would happen to an agent that was caught by the\nRussians?\" asked Blake.\n\n\"I'd rather not even think about that.\"\n\n\"Not the sadistic details, sir. I mean the general train of events,\nfrom the time of capture onward.\"\n\nThe President pondered this. \"After his capture,\" he said thoughtfully,\n\"he would be questioned. Through various methods--hopelessly at\nvariance with the regulations of the Geneva Convention--they would\ndiscover his mission, and then he would be shot, I guess, or\nimprisoned.\"\n\nBlake nodded grimly. \"And what if an agent landed there that could\n_not_ divulge his mission?\"\n\n<tb>\n\nThe Secretary stopped fiddling with the harness and watched the\nPresident's face. On the worn features he read first puzzlement, then\nincredulity, then a flash of sheer amazement.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said the President. \"They'd--they'd have to admit a\ndefeat, I suppose....\"\n\n\"But can they?\" Blake leaned forward and slammed his fist upon the\ntabletop. \"Can the Communist mentality ever admit that it's been\nbested?\"\n\n\"I--I guess not. At least, they never do,\" said the President. \"But\nthis--\" he wagged a forefinger at the stuffed thing on the table--\"this\ncertainly won't upset them. I mean, after all....\" He looked from\none to the other for agreement and found none. \"But, gentlemen, it's\nnothing but a stuffed bear!\"\n\n\"It won't upset them?\" queried Blake slowly. \"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Of course I'm sure. They'll find the bear, wherever it lands, and\nthey'll--well, they'll _know_ it's a gag and just laugh at us.\"\n\n\"_How_ will they know?\" Blake persisted.\n\n\"Well, they'll be _pretty_ well certain!\" the President said\nscathingly: \"I mean a stuffed toy--\"\n\n\"Would they give up on something of which they were 'pretty well'\ncertain?\"\n\n\"They'd have to. Teddy, here, certainly couldn't tell them anything.\nThey'd say it was a joke and forget it....\" His voice barely sounded\nthe last few words. He no longer believed them. A smile flickered upon\nhis face. \"Gentlemen, you don't think they'd--\"\n\n\"The Russians,\" said Blake, without emotion, \"would go off their\nrockers, sir. To be unable to explain a thing like this would devastate\ntheir morale. The Communist is a man who must hold all the aces. He'll\nshuffle and reshuffle until he gets them, too. Well, we're giving him a\ncold deck, sir. There are no aces for him to find.\"\n\n\"Hmmm,\" said the President. \"As long as there's any doubt in their\nminds, they'll have to keep plugging at it, won't they! And since\nthere's no solution--\" His smile grew calculating. \"Yes, yes I begin\nto see. It's a small thing, to be sure, but I find I must leap at the\nopportunity to stick a few ants in _their_ pants for a change.\"\n\n\"It won't wipe them out,\" began the Secretary.\n\n\"But it'll wear them down a little,\" Blake finished.\n\n\"Done!\" said the President. \"How soon can we get Operation Frustration\nunder way?\"\n\n\"The plane is ready to leave right now,\" said the Secretary, with a\nsmall blush. \"I--I rather thought you'd see this thing our way.\"\n\nThe President frowned at this, then shrugged. \"Good enough. Let's get\nthis bear into the air.\"\n\n<tb>\n\n\"You sure this plane will work?\" asked the President, averting his face\nfrom the spray of leaves caught up in the shrieking jet stream of the\nwaiting plane.\n\n\"It's too simple not to,\" said Blake, clutching the suitcase--on whose\nside a large red \"Top Secret\" had been stenciled--to his chest, and\nshouting over the scream of the plane. \"The radar-resistant device is\nnothing more than a radio-receiver that blankets the structure, making\nthe entire plane a receiver. If it receives the radar impulses, they\ncan't bounce back and make a blip on the enemy radar screens.\"\n\nThe President sighed. \"You make it sound almost too easy. Very well.\"\nHe shook the man's hand. \"Good luck.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Blake, patting the suitcase. \"I'll take good\ncare of Teddy.\"\n\nThe President nodded and moved away. Blake boarded the jet, and,\nminutes later, the President was watching a last fading streamer of the\ntwin exhausts dwindling upon the eastern horizon.\n\n\"I shan't sleep till he's back,\" said the Secretary.\n\n\"Nor I,\" said the President. \"I have the weirdest damned\napprehension....\"\n\n\"About what, sir?\" asked the Secretary, as they made their way from the\nfield.\n\n\"About the--\" the President looked around, then lowered his voice to a\nwhisper--\"the Russians. There's something in their makeup we may have\noverlooked.\"\n\n\"Impossible, sir,\" said the Secretary of Defense. \"Blake is our top\npsychologist.\"\n\n\"I hope you're right. If this fails, I'd hate for it to be traced to\nus.\"\n\n\"It can't be. The jacket was made in Japan, the boots in Mexico, the\nparachute in--\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" said the President. \"But if they _should_ trace it to\nus, we'll be a laughing-stock.\"\n\n\"They won't,\" the Secretary assured him.\n\n<tb>\n\nTwo days later, Blake was back, his manner jovial when he met in secret\nsession once more with the two executives.\n\n\"Couldn't have gone more perfectly, gentlemen,\" he said, rubbing his\nhands together and bouncing on his toes. \"We passed directly over\nMoscow, at a height of ten miles, on the stroke of midnight. The night\nwas overcast and starless. Teddy was dropped through the bomb bay. I\nsaw his parachute open myself. He's down there now, and we're sure to\nsee signs any day now of the little cracks in the Iron Curtain.\"\n\n\"You had no trouble with the enemy?\" the President asked, though the\nanswer--since Blake was back alive--was obvious.\n\n\"None,\" Blake said. \"The radar shield performed exactly as specified,\nsir. Not a blink of a searchlight nor a single ground-to-air rocket did\nwe see. Perhaps, on hearing us pass by, they sent up an investigating\nplane or two, but we were long gone by then. That's the advantage of\nmoving faster than the sound you make,\" he added pontifically.\n\n\"I still feel we've overlooked something,\" said the President. \"In the\nback of my mind, a small voice keeps trying to remind me of something\nabout the Russians, something that should have made me veto this whole\nscheme at the start.\"\n\nBlake looked puzzled. \"What about them, sir? If it's in regard to their\npsychology, I can assure you--\"\n\n\"I don't mean their psychology at _all_,\" said the President. \"No,\nwait--yes, I do, in a minor way. They must pursue this thing, no matter\nwhat, but--\"\n\nA light glimmered, then burned brightly in the President's eyes, and he\nstood up and smacked his fist into his open palm. \"Of course!\" he said.\n\"Their methods!\"\n\n\"Methods?\" asked Blake, a little nervously.\n\nThe President's reply was interrupted by a knock at the door. The\nthree men exchanged a look; then the Secretary jabbed the button, and\nJenkins came in.\n\n\"This just came for you, sir,\" he said, handing the Secretary a small\nenvelope, and making his exit silently.\n\nThe President waited impatiently as the envelope was torn open and its\ncontents read. Then the Secretary's hands opened limply and the message\nfell upon the table.\n\n\"Diplomatic note--Russian--Teddy,\" he whispered.\n\n\"What!\" yelped the President. He snatched the paper from the table and\nread it, then sank into his chair once more, his face grim and eyes\nsuspiciously moist. \"The dirty, lowdown, rotten....\"\n\nBlake, hovering at tableside, hesitated a moment, then asked, \"What\nabout Teddy? What's happened?\"\n\n\"What we might have expected,\" said the Secretary dolefully.\n\n\"You don't mean--\" Blake mumbled, horrified. He couldn't continue, just\nwaited for the worst.\n\nThe President nodded miserably.\n\n\"He's confessed.\"",
