    "body": "\"The ingratitude of humans,\" McBream said broodingly, \"is amazing.\nLoan a Martian a couple of I.U.'s when he's in a spot, and he'll send\nyou greeting cards on the anniversary for the rest of his life. Fish\na terrestrial out of the water when he's drowning, and he sends you\na bill from the tailor for resurfacin' his suit. Passengers!\" McBream\nspat in the direction of the lucite cuspidor.\n\nI picked up the book from McBream's desk and examined it. It was\nbeautifully printed on outsize sheets of silky preemitex, and bound in\nsmooth, deep-garnet Vellumium. On the spine of the book, in shining\nmiraloy, ran the words, FARQUARSON'S ENCHIRIDION OF EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL\nCOOKERY.\n\n\"This what you're so sore about?\" I asked.\n\n\"Sore?\" McBream snorted. \"Who's sore? Only petty, small-souled\nindividuals get sore at things. Me, I'm suffering from an attack of\nrighteous wrath. I'm not vindictive, but I hope Farquarson chokes over\none of his own recipes.\"\n\n\"The name sounds familiar,\" I ventured.\n\n\"It should be. Farquarson is culinary editor of _Pro Homine_, the\nsuper-sharp magazine for men. You must have heard of him. That book\nin your hand is supposed to be his masterpiece. Masterpiece!\" McBream\nsnorted again.\n\n\"It isn't as though he hadn't plenty of room for it,\" my friend\ncontinued in an aggrieved tone after a silence. \"The first ten pages\nof the book are taken up with acknowledgments and expressions of\ngratitude--you know, stuff like, 'My deep thanks, too, are due to\nLogarithmia McCloy for her skillful and patient typing of this book's\nmanuscript.' And it's dedicated to his hexapod, Waldmeister Schnitzel\nV. Luftraumzug, 'My six-legged friend and constant companion.' But\ndoes he mention Joseph McBream, first mate of the _S. S. Tisiphone_,\nanywhere in it? Just once? Just one single time? He does not. And yet,\nif it hadn't been for me that book would never have been written.\"\n\n\"Did you help him with the recipes?\" I asked.\n\n\"I did not,\" Joseph returned decisively. \"I'm no greasy groon-slinger.\nThe recipes in the ENCHIRIDION--agh, what a flossy way to say\nhandbook--came out of Farquarson's own little head. No, I didn't help\nhim with the recipes. I only saved his life.\"\n\n\"Tell me about it,\" I said.\n\n\n\n\"He got on the _Tisiphone_ at Marsport,\" Joseph McBream said, \"with\na sky-blue hexapod, four robot porters to carry his luggage, and a\nbeautiful blonde secretary who couldn't spell even using phonemes.\nAbout half his stateroom was taken up with cooking stuff. He had\npressure vats and tenderizers and relayed casseroles, more damned\njunk than you ever saw outside a museum. He probably had a couple\nof alembics and an athanor. It was all of it breakable, and the Old\nMan told everyone on board to be careful of it. Farquarson was some\ndynast's brother-in-law, and he didn't want to go offending him.\"\n\n\"What was he like personally?\" I queried.\n\n\"Farquarson? Oh, dignified. God-awful dignified in a loose-jointed\nintellectual sort of way. He always wore sports clothes and talked with\na sort of lazy drawl. His manners were beautiful. Everybody on board\nhated him.\n\n\"The first night out he got into a fracas with the cook about the\nproper way of barbolizing bollo ribs. Marno, being half-Venusian, was a\nsort of excitable gesell anyhow, and pretty soon we heard noises like\neverything in the galley had been thrown on the deck and was being\njumped up and down upon. It practically was, too, and though of course\nall that stuff is made of Fraxex, the bollo ribs got badly burned while\nthe discussion was going on. All we had for dinner that night was clear\nsoup, vigreen salad, and a sweet.\n\n\"The second night out of Marsport Farquarson came to my cabin--Johnny\nand I were bunking together then--and said he had a request to make.\nHe'd been told, he said, that 'spacies' (I wish you could have heard\nhim trying to use slang; it made you feel like there was a skin\ngrowing over your teeth)--that 'spacies' had a special drink they, ah,\nmanufactured surreptitiously on certain occasions when they were in\nspace. Its name he, ah, believed, was jet juice. Did we know anything\nabout it? Could we furnish any information concerning it to him?\"\n\n\n\nMcBream paused. His lips had drawn down in a sour grimace. It was\nobvious that he had become absorbed in memories as unpleasant as a dose\nof picrin would have been.\n\n\"And did you?\" I prompted.\n\n\"To the everlasting discredit of our common sense, we did. Afterward,\nwhen Johnny and I talked it over, we couldn't understand what had\ngot into us. It wasn't as though either of us liked him; and we\nknew perfectly well how the Old Man felt about jet juice on board\nhis precious _Tisiphone_. We acted like a couple of girls from the\nsatellites all overcome by the glamorous lights of the big space port.\nFarquarson must have hypnotized us with his fine emporium clothes and\nhis lazy drawl. An' the worst of it was, it was a wonderful batch of\njuice.\n\n\"I don't think I ever made a tastier. It had some bilial berries and\nkono shoots in it I picked up in Aphrodition, and the usual assortment\nof Martian fungi and grains. Just before we'd left Terra I'd had an\ninspiration and I'd put in three mangosteens and a big piece of durian.\nThey were to give it body and depth. Then of course we revved the\nmixture up with a bottle or two of soma and some cocla extract, and\nput it away to stew in a dark corner of the hold in free flight, away\nfrom the artigravs. It came out a kind of cloudy peach green, smooth as\nsatin and warm and deep and rich. It was a wonderful batch.\n\n\"Johnny got a bottle from under his bunk, where he kept it inside his\ndepilitating kit, and poured Farquarson a drink. The old yap tasted it\nand his eyebrows went up. 'Extraordinary!' said he. 'Ah--could I have\nsome more?'\n\n\"From first to last he finished two and three-quarter bottles of the\ndrink. When he went to his little bed that night, he was floating up to\nhis ears. He kept talking about the deadly paididion that was following\nhim, and wanting Johnny to let him come to grips with it.\n\n\"The next day the Old Man came down on us like a ton of osmium. He\ncalled us up to the bridge and said things that--well, I'm not a young\nman any more, but they made me feel like I was about fifteen, and\nJohnny had tears in his eyes before he was done. Then he sent a couple\nof crewmen into the hold and they smashed the carboy and poured out the\njuice. One of them told me afterward that there were tears in _his_\neyes, too.\n\n\"It seems that that black-hearted ape, Farquarson, had woke up with the\nhangover of the eon. Instead of taking his medicine like a little man,\nhe'd gone loping to the captain for 'remedial agents.' And then, of\ncourse, the fat was frying merrily.\n\n\"To do Denis (that was Farquarson's first name, Denis) justice, I don't\nthink he realized what he was letting us in for. The 'surreptitious' in\nthe speech he'd made us about jet juice hadn't really registered with\nhim. He probably thought the captain took a kind of 'spacies will be\nspacies' attitude with us.\n\n\"But Zinck fined us each two months' pay and ordered us confined to\nquarters except for necessary duty until we hit the first of the\nRafts in the Ring. The confinement to quarters was all right, bein'\ndisciplinary, but the pay docking, being financial, shouldn't have\nbeen imposed without a board meeting, an' we took it up with the\nunion. There was months and months of rowing, and at the end the board\naffirmed Zinck's fine and slapped another month's penalty on us on its\nown account.\"\n\nThere was a dispirited silence. \"About your saving his life....\" I\nmurmured.\n\n\n\nMcBream brightened. Plainly I had touched on a more pleasant segment of\nhis recollections. The corners of his mouth, which had been austerely\nturned downward, began to right themselves. \"Oh, that,\" he said.\n\n\"In order to know what happened, you got to know what the set-up was.\nFarquarson had already 'coped with' the cookery of the terra-type\nplanets, and done what he could with the farther, bigger ones. It's\npretty hard to get chummy with the inhabitants of Jupiter, even if\ntheir food was adapted to human digestions, and I notice Farquarson\nhas only three Jovian dishes in his book. But anyhow, he was finishing\nup with the fringes, the cookery of the satellites, and he'd booked\npassage on the _Tisiphone_ because we touched at so many of them.\n\n\"Like I said, he was related to some dynast with a lot of tug, and the\nOld Man, after checking with an inspector at Marsport, agreed to let\nhim have the use of the yellow life craft when he wanted it. It was\nsort of against regulations, but not too much.\n\n\"The craft's bein' yellow was important. Conformably to regulations,\nall the _Tisiphone's_ life craft were painted in the psychological\nprimary colors, to make assigning personnel to them for evacuation\neasier, and all of them carried two paint bombs to 'provide adequate\nmeans for prompt renewal of said paint, pigment, enameloid, or tint.'\nYou want to keep your eye on those paint bombs, because they come into\nthe picture later on.\n\n\"Well, Farquarson got along all right on the first couple or so\nsatellites. He didn't speak anything except terrestrial languages,\nwhich was rather a handicap, and there never were any interpreters.\nHe laid the fact that he was sick as a dog three or four times from\nthings the natives gave him to eat, to difficulties of communication.\nMyself, I thought somebody got annoyed with the trick he had of looking\ndown his nose and bleating 'Oh, rea-l-ly?' every few minutes, and\ndecided to take direct action.\n\n\"Anyhow, he was still in pretty good condition when we got to Iapetus.\nIapetus is under a universal dome. The first day he spent mooching\naround the port and buying things in native markets, but the next day\nhe asked for the life craft and started off by himself. We didn't think\nhe'd get into any trouble. He wasn't the soul of tact, of course, but\nthe Talipygians are usually a pretty mild bunch, good-tempered and fond\nof a joke.\"\n\n\"Talipygians?\" I asked.\n\n\"The secondary inhabitants of Iapetus. You can't photograph them\neasily, because they're partly electrical energy, and they're\npractically impossible to describe. They look like big maroon\nhedgehogs, as much as anything, with erectile electric crests over\ntheir heads, and lots of white sharp teeth.\n\n\n\n\"We were having supper on board the _Tisiphone_ when Sparks came in and\nspoke to the Old Man. He'd happened to be running over the afternoon\nwire on the reproducer, and he'd come across Farquarson's call for\nhelp. The blasted idiot hadn't sent it in code, which would have\nautomatically set up alarm signals, he'd just yelled 'Help!' into\nthe 'phone a couple of times, and he hadn't even thought to give his\nposition when he did it.\n\n\"Well, I got sent. In a way, it was a logical choice, because I knew\nas much as anybody on board about the Talipygians. Extra-terrestrial\nanthropology's always been a sort of hobby of mine. The beauteous\nblonde secretary was having hysterics and the hexapod was howling\nits head off in sympathy when I left. Just before I zoomed, Zinck\nsaid something in a stern voice about expecting me to return with\nFarquarson alive and in good condition, or he'd consider it a breach of\ndiscipline. He knew I didn't like him.\n\n\"I had a real devil of a time finding Denis. We get in the habit\nof talking as if a planet were about the size of California, and a\nsatellite no bigger than an amusement park. Take it from me, that's\nnothing but pure woola wash. A satellite the size of Iapetus seems\nas big as Terra itself when you're hunting a small object on it, and\nthat life craft was only about five meters long. Iapetus has mountains\nand rivers and woods and ravines and all sorts of stuff. I had object\ndetectors, of course, but Iapetus has lots of ore-bearing rocks,\nand anyhow, detectors are of very little use unless you're near the\nthing, and I had no idea where it was. I put in nearly fourteen hours\nhunting before I found the craft, and even then it was just luck that I\nstumbled on it.\n\n\"It was down in a gully on the edge of some woods. Everything looked\npeaceful and quiet, and Farquarson wasn't anywhere about. I hovered for\na while and thought it over, and then decided to land.\n\n\"I had side arms, of course, but I wasn't planning on using them. For\none thing, Farquarson might just have turned his ankle and considered\nit a catastrophe which warranted sending a call for help, and for\nanother, the Talipygians are protected by interplanetary law. They've\nbeen classified as a 'non-humanoid species of limited intelligence,'\nand that means that if you bother one of them all hell pops loose.\nQuite right, too.\" Joseph's manner was solemn. \"The non-human species\nof the system are one of our greatest natural resources.\n\n\n\n\"But as I was saying, I decided to land. I came down easy on\nquarter-jet, got out, and started toward the yellow life craft. I heard\na noise in the brush and turned to look. And the next thing I knew,\nthere I was inside the life craft with my head aching like I'd been\ndrinking eagle spit.\n\n\"I figured out later that one of the Talipygians had knocked me out\nwith a discharge from his erectile electric crest. They hardly ever\ndo it, because it's a psychic drain on them, and I'd overlooked the\npossibility of it.\n\n\"Farquarson was inside the craft, looking dignified and distressed. His\nhair was rumpled up and his nethers had completely lost their press.\n'I'm glad you've come, McBream,' he said as soon as my eyelids began\nflutterin'. 'Perhaps the two of us can contrive some way out of this\npredicament.'\n\n\"I sat up moaning and holding on to my head. It hurt so much my eyes\nfelt crossed. I could just make out, on the port side of the life\ncraft, a cooking pot with a mess of some reddish stuff in it. My side\narms, by the way, were gone. That's one of the things that makes me\nwonder if that phrase 'limited intelligence' in the description of the\nTalipygians is entirely justified.\n\n\"Anyhow, I helped myself up by pulling on the back of the pilot's seat.\nFarquarson watched me, his expression intellectual and lugubrious.\n'What's been happening?' I asked.\n\n\"He shook his head. 'I don't quite know,' he answered. 'I landed the\nlife craft in this spot, picked a quantity of an unknown deep red\nfruit, and was just trying it out in a dish to which I thought it\nwould be suitable, when I discovered that I was surrounded by a number\nof large purple animals. They looked threatening. I managed to call\n'Help!' into the receiver, and then I was knocked unconscious. Stunned.\n\n\"'When I recovered consciousness, I found that the craft had been\ndisabled and the means of communication were gone. The animals,\nMcBream, are still surrounding us.'\n\n\n\n\"I tottered over to a viewing port and looked out. What I saw made my\nblood run cold. The Talipygians were bumping around the life craft in\na circle, sliding on their behinds the way they always do, and from\ntime to time one of them would rear up and sort of shake his crest. It\ndidn't look so alarming in itself, but as I said, I know a few things\nabout the Talipygians, and that dance or whatever you'd call it is the\nthing a poetically minded anthropologist christened 'The Prelude to the\nSacrifice.' I told you the Talipygians had lots of teeth.\n\n\"'I can't imagine why they attacked me,' Farquarson said in a querulous\nvoice. 'I was only engaging in cookery.'\n\n\"I couldn't imagine, either. Usually all the Talipygians want is to\nbe left alone. Then I had a sudden wild idea. I stumbled over to the\ncooking pot and looked in it. Heaven help us! Do you know what that\ndouble-barreled fool of a Farquarson had selected to cook?\"\n\n\"No,\" I replied.\n\n\"A bunch of Tomato Babies.\"\n\nMcBream obviously expected me to be impressed with this piece of\ninformation. I struggled with it for a time and then gave up. \"I never\nheard of them,\" I said.\n\n\"Never _heard_ of them? What do they teach you kids on Terra nowadays?\nWhy, when I was going to school we had course after course in\nextra-terrestrial subjects, and you couldn't graduate unless you got\nat least a passing grade in Solar History. No wonder people are only\nhalf-educated these days!\" McBream sounded outraged.\n\nI had been thinking. \"Wait, now,\" I said, \"it seems to me I read a\npiece in a digest about the Tomato Babies a couple of years ago. Yes,\nI do remember. It was by a professor of Folklore in Ares City College,\nand he said that the myth of the Tomato Baby proved that the folklore\ntheme of the external soul--you know, like the stories in Grimm about\nthe giants who can't be killed because their souls are in magical eggs\nor crystals--that that theme was system-wide.\"\n\nMcBream looked at me. \"It isn't a myth,\" he said with a hint of\nindignation, \"it's perfectly true. The Folklorist who wrote that\narticle didn't know what he was talking about. The Tomato Babies are a\nbig red ovoid fruit that grows on floppy vines in a few odd places on\nIapetus. They're hollow inside, and the Talipygians put their souls in\nthem.\"\n\n\"_Hunh?_\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, more or less their souls. You remember I told you the\nTalipygians were hard to photograph because they were partly electrical\nenergy. When one of them is sick or wounded, the others take his soul\nout--the electrical part of him--and put it inside one of these fruits.\nThe Tomato Babies, as far as we can find out, are a sort of natural\nLeyden jar. Or maybe more like a storage battery. Anyhow, the point is\nthat a sick Talipygian doesn't have to suffer for months and months\nwhile he's getting well. His electrical component is popped into\none of these containers, and his body can devote itself quietly and\npainlessly to the business of recovering.\"\n\n\"And you mean Farquarson cooked--?\" I asked, boggling.\n\n\"Yes. Of course after the containers had been destroyed, the electrical\ncharge was lost. It wasn't quite as bad as murder, because the\nTalipygians say that when their personal electrical charge is released,\nit reshapes itself into a higher form; all the same, Farquarson had\nwiped out twenty or thirty relatives and friends of the beings who were\nbumping around outside the life craft in their sacrificial dance. When\nthe electrical charge is dissipated, the bodies wither away. No wonder\nthe Talipygians were sore.\n\n\"I wobbled back to the viewing port and looked at them. I'd always\nthought they were quiet, harmless creatures, for all their nearly human\nsize; now they seemed to be all teeth. I'd never realized before what\nparticularly vicious lower jaws they had.\n\n\"The thing to do was to try to get into communications with them. Now,\nI don't speak Talipygian. In my opinion, nobody does, though you'll\nmeet a few space rats who'll tell you they could write a grammar of it.\nBut the traders on Iapetus have worked out a system of conventionalized\nsigns, noises, and so on, for talking to the Talipygians, and it works\nwell enough most of the time.\n\n\"I began trying to attract their attention, making burp noises and\nwriggling my hands. For a long time they went on just as if they didn't\nnotice me. Then one of them, a faint shade bigger than the rest, left\nthe circle of bumpers and came and stood in front of me. His teeth were\nbigger, too. (I say 'his' but it might have been 'her' or 'its'--all I\ncould really be sure of were the teeth.)\n\n\"At first I tried to apologize and explain. The Talipygian listened for\na while and then made the noise that means 'No.' He wasn't interested.\nThen I tried threatening. I told him there'd be space cruisers hunting\nus, punitive expeditions, all that sort of thing. He didn't say\nanything at all this time, but I had the impression he was bubbling\nover with laughter inside.\n\n\n\n\"He was perfectly right, of course. Humanoid citizens of the system\nare supposed to know their rights and liabilities in dealing with\nnon-humanoid species. If Farquarson had got into trouble with the\nTalipygians, it was strictly his own lookout. Under the circumstances,\nif they carved us up, all the government would do would be to send\nregretful letters to the names in the 'whom to notify' spaces in\nFarquarson's and my dossiers.\n\n\"Bribery was the idea I got next. I turned my pockets out for trinkets\nand attractive junk. I waved a hunk of fossilized edelweiss and one of\nthose 'Halmjin' crystal games that were so popular last year in his\nface. No soap.\n\n\"The Talipygian flapped his flippers, erected his crest, and said\n'gunk' a couple of times. That meant, why bother? He'd get all of our\nbelongings anyhow after we were dead.\n\n\"Finally I asked him what they were planning to do with us. Eat us, the\nanswer came back like a flash. Of course I'd known it before, but it\nstill was a little disconcertin'. I'm not quite sure, but I think he\nsaid he was sorry I'd get eaten along with Farquarson. He couldn't help\nit, though.\n\n\"I went back inside the life craft and sat down to think. I was dead\ntired from all the work I'd put in hunting for Farquarson earlier,\nand my head still ached. And Farquarson kept dancing around me asking\nidiotic questions and wringing his hands.\n\n\"I pulled out of my mind all I'd ever heard about the Talipygian\ncharacter, and went over it. It wasn't much. They were said to have\nmild, peaceable natures, lay eggs, engage in ritual dances now an' then\nas a prelude to slaughtering the local animals, and be fond of a good\nlaugh. The mild and peaceful nature wasn't much in evidence just at\npresent; the eggs weren't relevant; _we_ were going to take the place\nof the local animals in the sacrifice, and how did the sense of humor\nhelp? I couldn't tell them funny stories in sign language, could I?\n\n\"As far as that went, I'd only seen a Talipygian amused once. That was\nwhen we were in port on Iapetus on the trip before. A fat Venusian\nhad been comin' down the steps of the Tashkent Import and Export\nExchange. He'd slipped on the top step and gone all the way down to the\nbottom, touching only the third and eighteenth steps on the way. It\nhad been quite spectacular. Of course he'd had to go to the hospital\nafterward and have five stitches taken, but the Talipygian couldn't\nhave known that at the time. Maybe it wouldn't have made any difference\nif he _had_ known--I had a feeling that his people liked their humor\npractical and rough.\n\n\"Farquarson came up to where I was sitting with my head in my hands,\nand nudged me. 'They're moving faster,' he said in a nervous tone.\n'Those things on the tops of their heads are flashing more and more\nfrequently. Do you suppose it means anything?'\n\n\n\n\"I went over to the port fast, and looked. Just as I'd feared, it meant\nall too much. Judging from the sign, the Talipygians were getting ready\nto make ritual hash of us.\n\n\"I tell you, I was desperate. Of course we could, and would, make a\nrush for it, but there were forty or fifty of them to two of us; we\nwere unarmed, and each and every Talipygian could deliver a stunning\nelectric shock. I could feel my mind giving off loud clicks like a\nGeiger counter near a rich source. What to do, what to do? Then my eyes\nlit on the rack holding the bomb with the yellow paint.\n\n\"Inside two minutes I had all the clothes off Farquarson except his\nsliskin shorts. At first he was too surprised to complain, even though\nhe turned out to have a considerable paunch. But when I took the paint\nbomb and began paintin' big bright daisies on his shoulders, back, and\ntummy-tum, he started to heat up; and when he found out what my idea\nwas, he really did get talky and obstreperous. 'I won't do it,' he said\nvigorously, 'I absolutely refuse. Not before these animals. Have you no\nconception, McBream, of dignity? I'd rather--' he glanced out of the\nport toward the toothy Talipygians and winced a little--'I'd rather be\ndead.'\n\n\"I tried to be reasonable with him. 'Listen, Denis,' I told him, 'it's\nabsolutely immaterial to me whether they eat you or not. In fact, I'm\nall in favor of their cutting you up in little pieces for a mess of\nshis-kebab. It would be the finest thing to happen to the System since\nthe discovery of Alpha-Omega power. Yet juicer!' (My feelin's overcame\nme a little when I thought of all the trouble Farquarson had got me\nin.) 'But if they eat you, they eat me too, for a side dish, and we\ncan't have that. On your way! Get!' I had to give him a push or two,\nbut he got.\"\n\n\"A push?\" I queried. Joseph's narrative was becoming interesting.\n\n\"With my foot. It was all to the good, I think--it limbered him up.\nWell, we went outside the life craft, hesitated a second or so, and\nwent into our dance.\n\n\"I was prepared to do my part. I'd painted big yellow flowers all over\nmyself too, and I didn't mind how big a fool I looked, provided it\nsaved my life. But it was plain right from the start that Farquarson,\nreluctant as he was, was the star of the show. The Talipygians hardly\nnoticed me. They stopped bumping almost immediately and clustered\naround Denis with their crests popping off and on like space port\nsignal lights.\n\n\"That guy really had talent. The idea of him writing a cook book with\na fancy title when he could perform like that! After he got started\nhe jumped up and down like one inspired, and once when he fell down,\nprobably accidentally, you could have heard the noise the Talipygians\nmade applaudin' with their flippers on the other side of Iapetus.\nFunny! Why, he'd have made a fortune on the stereo. All he needed was a\nlittle well-timed encouragement.\"\n\n\"Encouragement?\" I questioned.\n\n\n\nJoseph cast down his eyes. \"Well, you know,\" he said vaguely,\n\"things.... After a while the Talipygians themselves got the idea, an'\nwhenever Farquarson showed signs of slowin' down they shot long, slow,\nlow-voltage sparks out of their electric crests at him. One missed him\nonce and hit me instead; it was just like being stuck with a long,\nsharp pin.\n\n\"Pretty soon Farquarson got so warm the daisies on his tummy began\nrunnin'. The Talipygian chief gooped and guggled and geeked at me until\nI got the idea and fetched the bomb and painted them on real bright\nagain. I had to renew his daisies three times before we got out of\nthere.\"\n\nMcBream's expression was smug and self-satisfied. He looked like a\nweetareete which, having finished a jug of bovula cream on one side of\na theo table, knows that there is another jug, equally full and equally\naccessible, on the other side.\n\n\"But what finally happened?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well, the blue and green life craft from the _Tisiphone_ came\nafter us. Zinck was on the blue one himself--he thought it was that\nimportant. Farquarson was doin' splits and then jumpin' high up in the\nair, almost to the dome, when they got there. The daisies on his tummy\nwere good and bright.\n\n\"Zinck got out of the blue craft, trying hard to keep from smiling,\nand presented his compliments to the head Talipygian. They glooped\nand gunked for a minute or two, an' then any remainin' signs of a\nsmile disappeared from Zinck's face. For the trouble was this. The\nTalipygians didn't want to let Farquarson go.\n\n\"The conversation went something like this: Zinck: 'Gloop. Wheepie.\nGeet.' Intricate wiggle of hands.\n\n\"Talipygian: 'Nee. Neeeeee.'\n\n\"Farquarson: 'What is happening, McBream?'\n\n\"Me: 'Be quiet.'\n\n\"Zinck: 'Gleeed! Damn it, Gleeed!' (turning to us) 'They say they're\ngoing to hold him as recompense for all their relatives he murdered.'\n\n\"Farquarson: 'It was purely an accident!'\n\n\"Zinck: (sourly) 'You should have been more careful, Mr. Farquarson,\nreally you should--'Gleep. Wheepies. Blee.'\n\n\"The upshot of the matter was that Zinck negotiated a contract with the\nTalipygians. They agreed to release Denis on condition--\" here McBream\nseemed to be smacking his lips--\"on condition that he return on the\nsame date each year and perform for them. His costume, it was expressly\nstipulated, was to be the same, includin' the daisies.\n\n\"Farquarson didn't cut up as rough about the terms of the contract as\nI'd expected him to. I think he had the idea that a contract between\na human an' a non-humanoid species wouldn't be legally binding. But\nwhen we got back on the _Tisiphone_, Zinck explained to him that such\ncontracts are always made between the human on the one hand and the\nInterplanetary Government, acting for the non-humanoid species, on the\nother. Bindin'! It was more bindin' than a barrel full of nuclear-bond\nglue.\"\n\n\"And does he--?\" I murmured after a silence.\n\n\"Yes, every year. He'll be leaving for Iapetus day after tomorrow for\nhis annual pilgrimage. He always gets a lot of bon voyage gifts. Funny,\nisn't it? He begged Zinck and me--especially me--to keep the terms of\nthe contract quiet, and Zinck said he would. But like I said Farquarson\nalways gets a lot of bon voyage gifts and--isn't it odd?--they're\nalways flowers. Baskets and baskets and baskets of daisy flowers.\"\n\nThe corners of McBream's mouth, which had been somewhat elevated, began\nto turn down again. \"But isn't it ungrateful?\" he said indignantly.\n\"After I saved his life and all that! Wouldn't you think mere\nelementary decency would have made him mention me in his book?\"\n\n\"H'um,\" I said.",
