    "body": "It was not a sinister silence. No silence is sinister until it acquires\na background of understandable menace. Here there was only the night\nquiet of Maternity, the silence of noiseless rubber heels on the\nhospital corridor floor, the faint brush of starched white skirts\nbrushing through doorways into darkened and semi-darkened rooms.\n\nBut there was something wrong with the silence in the \"basket room\" of\nMaternity, the glass-walled room containing row on row, the tiny hopes\nof tomorrow. The curtain was drawn across the window through which,\nduring visiting hours, peered the proud fathers who did the hoping. The\nnight-light was dim.\n\nThe silence should not have been there.\n\nLorry Kane, standing in the doorway, looked out over the rows of silent\nbaskets and felt her blonde hair tighten at the roots. The tightening\ncame from instinct, even before her brain had a chance to function, from\nthe instincts and training of a registered nurse.\n\nThirty-odd babies grouped in one room and--_complete silence_.\n\nNot a single whimper. Not one tiny cry of protest against the annoying\nphenomenon of birth.\n\nThirty babies--_dead_? That was the thought that flashed, unbidden, into\nLorry's pretty head. The absurdity of it followed swiftly, and Lorry\nmoved on rubber soles between a line of baskets. She bent down and\nexplored with practiced fingers.\n\nA warm, living bundle in a white basket.\n\nThe feeling of relief was genuine. Relief, even from an absurdity, is a\nwelcome thing. Lorry smiled and bent closer.\n\nStaring up at Lorry from the basket were two clear blue eyes. Two eyes,\nsteady and fixed in a round baby face. An immobile, pink baby face\nhousing two blue eyes that stared up into Lorry's with a quiet\nconcentration that was chilling.\n\nLorry said, \"What's the matter with you?\" She spoke in a whisper and was\naddressing herself. She'd gone short on sleep lately--the only way,\nreally, to get a few hours with Pete. Pete was an interne at General\nHospital, and the kind of a homely grinning carrot-top a girl like Lorry\ncould put into dreams as the center of a satisfactory future.\n\nBut all this didn't justify a case of jitters in the \"basket room.\"\n\nLorry said. \"Hi, short stuff,\" and lifted Baby Newcomb--Male, out of his\ncrib for a cuddling.\n\nBaby Newcomb didn't object. The blue eyes came closer. The week-old eyes\nwith the hundred-year-old look. Lorry laid the bundle over her shoulder\nand smiled into the dimness.\n\n\"You want to be president, Shorty?\" Lorry felt the warmth of a new life,\nfelt the little body wriggle in snug contentment. \"I wouldn't advise it.\nTough job.\" Baby Newcomb twisted in his blanket. Lorry stiffened.\n\n_Snug contentment?_\n\nLorry felt two tiny hands clutch and dig into her throat. Not just\npawing baby hands. Little fingers that reached and explored for the\nwindpipe.\n\nShe uncuddled the soft bundle, held it out. There were the eyes. She\nchilled. No imagination here. No spectre from lack of sleep.\n\nAncient murder-hatred glowing in new-born eyes.\n\n\n\n\"Careful, you fool! You'll drop this body.\" A thin piping voice. A\nshrill symphony in malevolence.\n\nFear weakened Lorry. She found a chair and sat down. She held the boy\nbaby in her hands. Training would not allow her to drop Baby Newcomb.\nEven if she had fainted, she would not have let go.\n\n\n\nThe shrill voice: \"It was stupid of me. Very stupid.\"\n\nLorry was cold, sick, mute.\n\n\"Very stupid. These hands are too fragile. There are no muscles in the\narms. I couldn't have killed you.\"\n\n\"Please--I ...\"\n\n\"Dreaming? No. I'm surprised at--well, at your surprise. You have a\ntrained mind. You should have learned, long ago, to trust your senses.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Don't look at the doorway. Nobody's coming in. Look at me. Give me a\nlittle attention and I'll explain.\"\n\n\"Explain?\" Lorry pulled her eyes down to the cherubic little face as she\nparroted dully.\n\n\"I'll begin by reminding you that there are more things in existence\nthan your obscene medical books tell you about.\"\n\n\"Who are you? What are you?\"\n\n\"One of those things.\"\n\n\"You're not a baby!\"\n\n\"Of course not. I'm ...\" The beastly, brittle voice drifted into silence\nas though halted by an intruding thought. Then the thought voiced--voiced\nwith a yearning at once pathetic and terrible: \"It would be nice to kill\nyou. Someday I will. Someday I'll kill you if I can find you.\"\n\n\"Why? Why?\" Insane words in an insane world. But life had not stopped\neven though madness had taken over. \"Why?\"\n\nThe voice was matter-of-fact again. No more time for pleasant daydreams.\n\"I'm something your books didn't tell you about. Naturally you're\nbewildered. Did you ever hear of a bodyless entity?\"\n\nLorry shuddered in silence.\n\n\"You've heard of bodyless entities, of course--but you denied their\nexistence in your smug world of precise tidy detail. I'm a bodyless\nentity. I'm one of a swarm. We come from a dimension your mind wouldn't\naccept even if I explained it, so I'll save words. We of the swarm seek\nunfoldment--fulfillment--even as you in your stupid, blind world. Do you\nwant to hear more?\"\n\n\"I ...\"\n\n\"You're a fool, but I enjoy practicing with these new vocal chords, just\nas I enjoyed flexing the fingers and muscles. That's why I revealed\nmyself. We are, basically of course, parasites. In the dimension where\nwe exist in profusion, evolution has provided for us. There, we seek out\nand move into a dimensional entity far more intelligent than yourself.\nWe destroy it in a way you wouldn't understand, and it is not important\nthat you should. In fact, I can't see what importance there is in your\nexisting at all.\"\n\n\"You plan to--kill all these babies?\"\n\n\"Let me congratulate you. You've finally managed to voice an intelligent\nquestion. The answer is, no. We aren't strong enough to kill them. We\ndwelt in a far more delicate dimension than this one and all was in\nproportion. That was our difficulty when we came here. We could find no\nentities weak enough to take possession of until we came upon this\nroomful of infants.\"\n\n\"Then, if you're helpless ...\"\n\n\"What do we plan to do? That's quite simple. These material entities\nwill grow. We will remain attached--ingrained, so to speak. When the\nbodies enlarge sufficiently ...\"\n\n\"_Thirty potential assassins...._\" Lorry spoke again to herself, then\nhurled the words back into her own mind as her sickness deepened.\n\nThe shrill chirping: \"What do you mean, potential? The word expresses a\ndoubt. Here there is none.\" The entity's chuckle sounded like a baby,\ncontent over a full bottle. \"Thirty certain assassins.\"\n\n\"But why must you kill?\"\n\nLorry was sure the tiny shoulders shrugged. \"Why? I don't know. I never\nthought to wonder. Why must you join with a man and propagate some day?\nWhy do you feel sorry for what you term an unfortunate? Explain your\ninstincts and I'll explain mine.\"\n\nLorry felt herself rising. Stiffly, she put Baby Newcomb back into his\nbasket. As she did so, a ripple of shrill, jerky laughter crackled\nthrough the room. Lorry put her hands to her ears. \"You know I can't say\nanything. You'd keep quiet. They'd call me mad.\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\nMalicious laughter, like driven sleet, cut into her ears as she fled\nfrom the room.\n\n\n\nPeter Larchmont, M.D., was smoking a quick cigarette by an open\nfire-escape door on the third floor. He turned as Lorry came down the\ncorridor, flipped his cigarette down into the alley and grinned. \"Women\nshouldn't float on rubber heels,\" he said. \"A man should have warning.\"\n\nLorry came close. \"Kiss me. Kiss me--hard.\"\n\nPete kissed her, then held her away. \"You're trembling. Anticipation,\npet?\" He looked into her face and the grin faded. \"Lorry, what is it?\"\n\n\"Pete--Pete. I'm crazy. I've gone mad. Hold me.\"\n\nHe could have laughed, but he had looked closely into her eyes and he\nwas a doctor. He didn't laugh. \"Tell me. Just stand here. I'll hang onto\nyou and you tell me.\"\n\n\"The babies--they've gone mad.\" She clung to him. \"Not exactly that.\nSomething's taken them over. Something terrible. Oh, Pete! Nobody would\nbelieve me.\"\n\n\"I believe the end result,\" he said, quietly. \"That's what I'm for,\nangel. When you shake like this I'll always believe. But I'll have to\nknow more. And I'll hunt for an answer.\"\n\n\"There isn't any answer, Pete. I _know_.\"\n\n\"We'll still look. Tell me more, first.\"\n\n\"There isn't any more.\" Her eyes widened as she stared into his with the\nshock of a new thought. \"Oh, Lord! One of them talked to me, but maybe\nhe--or it--won't talk to you. Then you'll never know for sure! You'll\nthink I'm ...\"\n\n\"Stop it. Quit predicting what I'll do. Let's go to the nursery.\"\n\nThey went to the nursery and stayed there for three-quarters of an\nhour. They left with the tinny laughter filling their minds--and the\nlast words of the monstrous entity.\n\n\"We'll say no more, of course. Perhaps even this incident has been\nindiscreet. But it's in the form of a celebration. Never before has a\nwhole swarm gotten through. Only a single entity on rare occasions.\"\n\nPete leaned against the corridor wall and wiped his face with the sleeve\nof his jacket. \"We're the only ones who know,\" he said.\n\n\"Or ever will know.\" Lorry pushed back a lock of his curly hair. She\nwanted to kiss him, but this didn't seem to be the place or the time.\n\n\"We can never tell anyone.\"\n\n\"We'd look foolish.\"\n\n\"We've got a horror on our hands and we can't pass it on.\"\n\n\"What are we going to do?\" Lorry asked.\n\n\"I don't know. Let's recap a little. Got a cigarette?\"\n\nThey went to the fire door and dragged long and deep on two from Lorry's\npack. \"They'll be quiet from now on. No more talking--just baby\nsqualls.\"\n\n\"And thirty little assassins will go into thirty homes,\" Lorry said.\n\"All dressed in soft pink and blue, all filled with hatred. Waiting,\nbiding their time, growing more clever.\" She shuddered.\n\n\"The electric chair will get them all, eventually.\"\n\n\"But how many will they get in the meantime?\"\n\nPete put his arms around her and drew her close and whispered into her\near. \"There's nothing we can do--nothing.\"\n\n\"We've got to do something.\" Lorry heard again the thin, brittle\nlaughter following her, taunting her.\n\n\"It was a bad dream. It didn't happen. We'll just have to sleep it off.\"\n\nShe put her cheek against his. The rising stubble of his beard scratched\nher face. She was grateful for the rough touch of solid reality.\n\nPete said, \"The shock will wear out of our minds. Time will pass. After\na while, we won't believe it ourselves.\"\n\n\"That's what I'm afraid of.\"\n\n\"It's got to be that way.\"\n\n\"We've got to do something.\"\n\nPete lowered his arm wearily. \"Yeah--we've got to do something. Where\nthere's nothing that can be done. What are we--miracle workers?\"\n\n\"We've got to do something.\"\n\n\"Sure--finish out the watch and then get some sleep.\"\n\n\n\nLorry awoke with the lowering sun in her window. It was a blood red sun.\nShe picked up the phone by her bedside. \"Room 307 Resident's extension.\"\n\nPete answered drowsily. Lorry said, \"Tell me--did I dream, or did it\nreally happen.\"\n\n\"I was going to ask you the same thing. I guess it happened. What are\nyou doing?\"\n\n\"Lying in bed.\"\n\n\"So am I. But two different beds. Things are done all wrong.\"\n\n\"Want to take a chance and sneak over? I've got an illegal coffee pot.\"\n\n\"Leave the door unlocked.\"\n\nLorry put on the coffee. She showered and got into her slip. She was\nbrushing her hair when Pete came in. He looked at her and extended\nbeckoning, clutching fingers. \"The hell with phantoms. Come here.\"\n\nAfter a couple of minutes, Lorry pulled away and poured the coffee. She\nreached for her uniform. Pete said, \"Don't put it on yet.\"\n\n\"Too dangerous--leaving it off.\"\n\nHe eyed her dreamily. \"I'll dredge up will power. I'll also get scads of\nfat rich clients. Then we'll get married so I can assault you legally.\"\n\nLorry studied him. \"You're not even listening to yourself. What is it,\nPete? What have you dreamed up?\"\n\n\"Okay. I've got an idea. You said something would have to be done.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"A drastic cure for a drastic case. With maybe disaster as the end\nproduct.\"\n\n\"Tell me.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you a little, but not too much.\"\n\n\"Why not all?\"\n\n\"Because if we ever land in court. I want you to be able to say under\noath, 'He didn't tell me what he planned to do.'\"\n\n\"I don't like that.\"\n\n\"I don't care if you like it or not. Tell me, what's the one basic thing\nthat stands out in your mind about these--entities?\"\n\n\"That they're ...\"\n\n\"Fragile?\"\n\n\"Yes--fragile.\"\n\n\"Give me some more coffee.\"\n\n\n\nLorry demanded to know what was in Pete's mind. All she got was kissed,\nand she did not see Pete again until eleven o'clock that night. He found\nher in the corridor in Maternity and motioned her toward the nursery. He\ncarried a tray under a white towel. He said, \"You watch the door. I'm\ngoing inside. I'll be about a half an hour.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"You stay out here and mind your business. Your business will be to\nsteer any nosey party away. If you can't, make noise coming in.\"\n\nDoc Pete turned away and entered the nursery. Lorry stood at the\ndoorway, in the silence, under the brooding night-light, and prayed.\n\nTwenty-five minutes later, Pete came out. His face was white and drawn.\nHe looked like a man who had lately had a preview of Hell's inverted\npleasures. His hands trembled. The towel still covered the tray. He\nsaid, \"Watch them close. Don't move ten steps from here.\" He started\naway--turned back. \"All hell is scheduled to break loose in this\nhospital shortly. Let's hope God remains in charge.\"\n\nLorry saw the sick dread of his heart underneath his words.\n\n\n\nIt could have been a major scandal. An epidemic of measles on the\nmaternity floor of a modern hospital indicates the unforgivable medical\nsin--carelessness. It was hushed up as much as possible, pending the\ntime when the top people could shake off the shock and recover their\nwits. The ultimate recovery of thirty babies was a tribute to everyone\nconcerned.\n\nWan, done-in, Doc Pete drank coffee in Lorry's room. Lorry gave him\nthree lumps of sugar and said, \"But are you sure the sickness killed the\nentities?\"\n\n\"Quite sure. Somehow they _knew_ when I made the injections. They\nscreamed. They knew they were done for.\"\n\n\"It took courage. Tell me: why are you so strong, so brave? Why are you\nso wonderful?\"\n\n\"Cut it out. I was scared stiff. If _one_ baby had died, I'd have gone\nthrough life weighing the cure against the end. It isn't easy to risk\ndoing murder--however urgent the need.\"\n\nShe leaned across and kissed him. \"And you were all alone. You wouldn't\nlet me help. Was that fair?\"\n\nHe grinned, then sobered. \"But I can't help remembering what that--that\ninvisible monster said: '_Never before has a whole swarm gotten through.\nOnly a single entity on rare occasions._'\n\n\"I can't help wondering what happens to those single entities. I think\nof the newspaper headlines I've seen: Child Kills Parents in Sleep.\nYouth Slays Father. I'll probably always wonder--and I'll always\nremember....\"\n\nLorry got up and crossed to him and put her arms around him. \"Not\nalways,\" she whispered. \"There will be times when I'll make you forget.\nFor a little while, anyhow.\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n",
