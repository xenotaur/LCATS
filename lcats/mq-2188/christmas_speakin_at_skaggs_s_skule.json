Everybody likes them. Sheet music. Price, 35 cents each.\n\n=HERE\u2019S TO THE LAND OF THE STARS AND THE STRIPES.= (Bugbee-Worrell.) A\npatriotic song which every child should know and love. The sentiment\nis elevating. The music is martial and inspiring. May be effectively\nsung by the entire school. Suitable for any occasion and may be sung by\nchildren or grown-ups. Be the first to use this song in your community.\n\n=I\u2019LL NEVER PLAY WITH YOU AGAIN.= (Guptill-Weaver.) A quarrel between a\nsmall boy and girl. The words are defiant and pert. The boy and his dog\nhave been in mischief, and the small maiden poutingly declares that she\nwill never play with him again, but changes her mind in the last verse.\nA taking little duet for any occasion, with full directions for motions.\n\n=JOLLY FARMER LADS AND LASSIES.= (Irish-Lyman.) A decidedly humorous\naction song prepared especially for district schools. It will make a\nhit wherever produced.\n\n=JOLLY PICKANINNIES.= (Worrell.) Introduce this coon song into your\nnext entertainment. If you use the directions for the motions which\naccompany the music, the pickaninnies will bring down the house. Their\nblack faces and shining eyes will guarantee a \u201chit.\u201d The words are\ngreat and the music just right.\n\n=LULLABY LANE.= (Worrell.) This song is one which the children, once\nhaving learned, will never forget. The words have the charm of the\nverses written by Robert Louis Stevenson. The music is equally sweet\nand is perfectly suited to the beautiful words. It may be sung as a\nsolo by a little girl with a chorus of other little girls with dolls,\nor as a closing song by the whole school.\n\n=MY OWN AMERICA, I LOVE BUT THEE.= (Worrell.) Here is a song that will\narouse patriotism in the heart of every one who hears it. The music is\nso catchy that the children and grown-ups, too, just can\u2019t resist it.\nIt makes a capital marching song.\n\n=NOW, AREN\u2019T YOU GLAD YOU CAME?= (Guptill-Weaver.) This is a closing\nsong which is quite out of the ordinary. There is humor in every line.\nThe music is lively. Your audience will not soon forget this spicy song\nfor it will get many an unexpected laugh. The motions which accompany\nthis song make it doubly effective. For any occasion and for any number\nof children.\n\n=WE ARE CREEPY LITTLE SCARECROWS.= (Guptill-Weaver.) A weird,\nfascinating action song. You can\u2019t go wrong with this song. There are\nfour verses and chorus. Complete directions accompany this song so that\nit may be featured as a song and drill, if desired. For any occasion\nand for any number of children.\n\n=WE\u2019VE JUST ARRIVED FROM BASHFUL TOWN.= (Worrell.) This song will bring\nmemories to the listeners of their own bashful school days. They will\nrecall just how \u201cscared\u201d they were when asked to sing or play or speak.\nThe words are unusually clever. The music is decidedly melodious. It\nmakes a capital welcome song or it may be sung at any time on any\nprogram with assured success.\n\n=WE HOPE YOU\u2019VE BROUGHT YOUR SMILES ALONG.= (Worrell.) A welcome song\nthat will at once put the audience in a joyous frame of mind and create\na happy impression that will mean half the success of your entire\nprogram. Words, bright and inspiring. Music, catchy. A sure hit for\nyour entertainment.\n\n=WE\u2019LL NOW HAVE TO SAY GOOD-BYE.= (Worrell.) This beautiful song has\nsnap and go that will appeal alike to visitors and singers.
