    "body": "Nobody in the neighborhood was surprised when Martin's mother\ndisappeared and Ninian came to take care of him. Mothers had a way\nof disappearing around those parts and the kids were often better\noff without them. Martin was no exception. He'd never had it this\ngood while he was living with his old lady. As for his father, Martin\nhad never had one. He'd been a war baby, born of one of the tides of\nsoldiers--enemies and allies, both--that had engulfed the country in\nsuccessive waves and bought or taken the women. So there was no trouble\nthat way.\n\nSometimes he wondered who Ninian really was. Obviously that story\nabout her coming from the future was just a gag. Besides, if she really\nwas his great-great-grand-daughter, as she said, why would she tell\nhim to call her \"_Aunt Ninian_\"? Maybe he was only eleven, but he'd\nbeen around and he knew just what the score was. At first he'd thought\nmaybe she was some new kind of social worker, but she acted a little\ntoo crazy for that.\n\nHe loved to bait her, as he had loved to bait his mother. It was safer\nwith Ninian, though, because when he pushed her too far, she would cry\ninstead of mopping up the floor with him.\n\n\"But I can't understand,\" he would say, keeping his face straight. \"Why\ndo you have to come from the future to protect me against your cousin\nConrad?\"\n\n\"Because he's coming to kill you.\"\n\n\"Why should he kill me? I ain't done him nothing.\"\n\nNinian sighed. \"He's dissatisfied with the current social order and\nkilling you is part of an elaborate plan he's formulated to change it.\nYou wouldn't understand.\"\n\n\"You're damn right. I _don't_ understand. What's it all about in\nstraight gas?\"\n\n\"Oh, just don't ask any questions,\" Ninian said petulantly. \"When you\nget older, someone will explain the whole thing to you.\"\n\n\n\nSo Martin held his peace, because, on the whole, he liked things the\nway they were. Ninian really was the limit, though. All the people he\nknew lived in scabrous tenement apartments like his, but she seemed to\nthink it was disgusting.\n\n\"So if you don't like it, clean it up,\" he suggested.\n\nShe looked at him as if he were out of his mind.\n\n\"Hire a maid, then!\" he jeered.\n\nAnd darned if that dope didn't go out and get a woman to come clean up\nthe place! He was so embarrassed, he didn't even dare show his face in\nthe streets--especially with the women buttonholing him and demanding\nto know what gave. They tried talking to Ninian, but she certainly knew\nhow to give them the cold shoulder.\n\nOne day the truant officer came to ask why Martin hadn't been coming\nto school. Very few of the neighborhood kids attended classes very\nregularly, so this was just routine. But Ninian didn't know that and\nshe went into a real tizzy, babbling that Martin had been sick and\nwould make up the work. Martin nearly did get sick from laughing so\nhard inside.\n\nBut he laughed out of the other side of his mouth when she went out and\nhired a private tutor for him. A tutor--in that neighborhood! Martin\nhad to beat up every kid on the block before he could walk a step\nwithout hearing \"Fancy Pants!\" yelled after him.\n\nNinian worried all the time. It wasn't that she cared what these people\nthought of her, for she made no secret of regarding them as little\nbetter than animals, but she was shy of attracting attention. There\nwere an awful lot of people in that neighborhood who felt exactly the\nsame way, only she didn't know that, either. She was really pretty\ndumb, Martin thought, for all her fancy lingo.\n\n\"It's so hard to think these things out without any prior practical\napplication to go by,\" she told him.\n\nHe nodded, knowing what she meant was that everything was coming out\nwrong. But he didn't try to help her; he just watched to see what\nshe'd do next. Already he had begun to assume the detached role of a\nspectator.\n\nWhen it became clear that his mother was never going to show up again,\nNinian bought one of those smallish, almost identical houses that\nmushroom on the fringes of a city after every war, particularly where\nintensive bombing has created a number of desirable building sites.\n\n\"This is a much better neighborhood for a boy to grow up in,\" she\ndeclared. \"Besides, it's easier to keep an eye on you here.\"\n\nAnd keep an eye on him she did--she or a rather foppish young man who\ncame to stay with them occasionally. Martin was told to call him Uncle\nRaymond.\n\nFrom time to time, there were other visitors--Uncles Ives and\nBartholomew and Olaf, Aunts Ottillie and Grania and Lalage, and many\nmore--all cousins to one another, he was told, all descendants of his.\n\n\n\nMartin was never left alone for a minute. He wasn't allowed to play\nwith the other kids in the new neighborhood. Not that their parents\nwould have let them, anyway. The adults obviously figured that if\na one-car family hired private tutors for their kid, there must be\nsomething pretty wrong with him. So Martin and Ninian were just as\nconspicuous as before. But he didn't tip her off. She was grown up; she\nwas supposed to know better than he did.\n\nHe lived well. He had food to eat that he'd never dreamed of before,\nwarm clothes that no one had ever worn before him. He was surrounded by\nmore luxury than he knew what to do with.\n\nThe furniture was the latest New Grand Rapids African modern. There\nwere tidy, colorful Picasso and Braque prints on the walls. And every\ninch of the floor was modestly covered by carpeting, though the walls\nwere mostly unabashed glass. There were hot water and heat all the time\nand a freezer well stocked with food--somewhat erratically chosen, for\nNinian didn't know much about meals.\n\nThe non-glass part of the house was of neat, natural-toned wood, with a\nneat green lawn in front and a neat parti-colored garden in back.\n\nMartin missed the old neighborhood, though. He missed having other\nkids to play with. He even missed his mother. Sure, she hadn't given\nhim enough to eat and she'd beaten him up so hard sometimes that she'd\nnearly killed him--but then there had also been times when she'd hugged\nand kissed him and soaked his collar with her tears. She'd done all\nshe could for him, supporting him in the only way she knew how--and if\nrespectable society didn't like it, the hell with respectable society.\n\nFrom Ninian and her cousins, there was only an impersonal kindness.\nThey made no bones about the fact that they were there only to carry\nout a rather unpleasant duty. Though they were in the house with him,\nin their minds and in their talk they were living in another world--a\nworld of warmth and peace and plenty where nobody worked, except in the\ngovernment service or the essential professions. And they seemed to\nthink even that kind of job was pretty low-class, though better than\nactually doing anything with the hands.\n\nIn their world, Martin came to understand, nobody worked with hands;\neverything was done by machinery. All the people ever did was wear\npretty clothes and have good times and eat all they wanted. There was\nno devastation, no war, no unhappiness, none of the concomitants of\nnormal living.\n\nIt was then that Martin began to realize that either the whole lot of\nthem were insane, or what Ninian had told him at first was the truth.\nThey came from the future.\n\n\n\nWhen Martin was sixteen, Raymond took him aside for the talk Ninian had\npromised five years before.\n\n\"The whole thing's all my brother Conrad's fault. You see, he's an\nidealist,\" Raymond explained, pronouncing the last word with distaste.\n\nMartin nodded gravely. He was a quiet boy now, his brief past a dim and\nrather ridiculous memory. Who could ever imagine him robbing a grocery\nstore or wielding a broken bottle now? He still was rather undersized\nand he'd read so much that he'd weakened his eyes and had to wear\nglasses. His face was pallid, because he spent little time in the sun,\nand his speech rather overbred, his mentors from the future having\ncarefully eradicated all current vulgarities.\n\n\"And Conrad really got upset over the way Earth has been exploiting\nthe not so intelligent life-forms on the other planets,\" Raymond\ncontinued. \"Which _is_ distressing--though, of course, it's not as\nif they were people. Besides, the government has been talking about\npassing laws to do away with the--well, abuses and things like that,\nand I'm sure someday everything will come out all right. However,\nConrad is so impatient.\"\n\n\"I thought, in your world, machines did all the work,\" Martin suggested.\n\n\"I've told you--our world is precisely the same as this one!\" Raymond\nsnapped. \"We just come a couple of centuries or so later, that's all.\nBut remember, our interests are identical. We're virtually the same\npeople ... although it is amazing what a difference two hundred odd\nyears of progress and polish can make in a species, isn't it?\"\n\nHe continued more mildly: \"However, even you ought to be able to\nunderstand that we can't make machinery without metal. We need food.\nAll that sort of thing comes from the out-system planets. And, on those\nworlds, it's far cheaper to use native labor than to ship out all that\nexpensive machinery. After all, if we didn't give the natives jobs, how\nwould they manage to live?\"\n\n\"How did they live before? Come to think of it, if you don't work, how\ndo _you_ live now?... I don't mean in the now for me, but the now for\nyou,\" Martin explained laboriously. It was so difficult to live in the\npast and think in the future.\n\n\"I'm trying to talk to you as if you were an adult,\" Raymond said, \"but\nif you will persist in these childish interruptions--\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Martin said.\n\nBut he wasn't, for by now he had little respect left for any of\nhis descendants. They were all exceedingly handsome and cultivated\nyoung people, with superior educations, smooth ways of speaking and\nconsiderable self-confidence, but they just weren't very bright. And\nhe had discovered that Raymond was perhaps the most intelligent of the\nlot. Somewhere in that relatively short span of time, his line or--more\nfrightening--his race had lost something vital.\n\nUnaware of the near-contempt in which his young ancestor held him,\nRaymond went on blandly: \"Anyhow, Conrad took it upon himself to\nfeel particularly guilty, because, he decided, if it hadn't been for\nthe fact that our great-grandfather discovered the super-drive, we\nmight never have reached the stars. Which is ridiculous--his feeling\nguilty, I mean. Perhaps a great-grandfather is responsible for his\ngreat-grandchildren, but a great-grandchild can hardly be held\naccountable for his great-grandfather.\"\n\n\"How about a great-great-grandchild?\" Martin couldn't help asking.\n\n\n\nRaymond flushed a delicate pink. \"Do you want to hear the rest of this\nor don't you?\"\n\n\"Oh, I do!\" Martin said. He had pieced the whole thing together for\nhimself long since, but he wanted to hear how Raymond would put it.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Professor Farkas has just perfected the time\ntransmitter. Those government scientists are so infernally\nofficious--always inventing such senseless things. It's supposed to\nbe hush-hush, but you know how news will leak out when one is always\ndesperate for a fresh topic of conversation.\"\n\nAnyhow, Raymond went on to explain, Conrad had bribed one of Farkas'\nassistants for a set of the plans. Conrad's idea had been to go back\nin time and \"eliminate!\" their common great-grandfather. In that way,\nthere would be no space-drive, and, hence, the Terrestrials would never\nget to the other planets and oppress the local aborigines.\n\n\"Sounds like a good way of dealing with the problem,\" Martin observed.\n\nRaymond looked annoyed. \"It's the _adolescent_ way,\" he said, \"to do\naway with it, rather than find a solution. Would you destroy a whole\nsociety in order to root out a single injustice?\"\n\n\"Not if it were a good one otherwise.\"\n\n\"Well, there's your answer. Conrad got the apparatus built, or perhaps\nhe built it himself. One doesn't inquire too closely into such\nmatters. But when it came to the point, Conrad couldn't bear the idea\nof eliminating our great-grandfather--because our great-grandfather\nwas such a _good_ man, you know.\" Raymond's expressive upper lip\ncurled. \"So Conrad decided to go further back still and get rid of\nhis great-grandfather's father--who'd been, by all accounts, a pretty\nworthless character.\"\n\n\"That would be me, I suppose,\" Martin said quietly.\n\nRaymond turned a deep rose. \"Well, doesn't that just go to prove you\nmustn't believe everything you hear?\" The next sentence tumbled out in\na rush. \"I wormed the whole thing out of him and all of us--the other\ncousins and me--held a council of war, as it were, and we decided it\nwas our moral duty to go back in time ourselves and protect you.\" He\nbeamed at Martin.\n\nThe boy smiled slowly. \"Of course. You had to. If Conrad succeeded in\n_eliminating_ me, then none of you would exist, would you?\"\n\nRaymond frowned. Then he shrugged cheerfully. \"Well, you didn't really\nsuppose we were going to all this trouble and expense out of sheer\naltruism, did you?\" he asked, turning on the charm which all the\ncousins possessed to a consternating degree.\n\n\n\nMartin had, of course, no illusions on that score; he had learned long\nago that nobody did anything for nothing. But saying so was unwise.\n\n\"We bribed another set of plans out of another of the professor's\nassistants,\" Raymond continued, as if Martin had answered,\n\"and--ah--induced a handicraft enthusiast to build the gadget for us.\"\n\n_Induced_, Martin knew, could have meant anything from blackmail to the\nuse of the iron maiden.\n\n\"Then we were all ready to forestall Conrad. If one of us guarded you\nnight and day, he would never be able to carry out his plot. So we made\nour counter-plan, set the machine as far back as it would go--and here\nwe are!\"\n\n\"I see,\" Martin said.\n\nRaymond didn't seem to think he really did. \"After all,\" he pointed\nout defensively, \"whatever our motives, it has turned into a good\nthing for you. Nice home, cultured companions, all the contemporary\nconveniences, plus some handy anachronisms--I don't see what more you\ncould ask for. You're getting the best of all possible worlds. Of\ncourse Ninian _was_ a ninny to locate in a mercantile suburb where any\nlittle thing out of the way will cause talk. How thankful I am that our\nera has completely disposed of the mercantiles--\"\n\n\"What did you do with them?\" Martin asked.\n\nBut Raymond rushed on: \"Soon as Ninian goes and I'm in full charge,\nwe'll get a more isolated place and run it on a far grander scale.\nOstentation--that's the way to live here and now; the richer you are,\nthe more eccentricity you can get away with. And,\" he added, \"I might\nas well be as comfortable as possible while I suffer through this\nwretched historical stint.\"\n\n\"So Ninian's going,\" said Martin, wondering why the news made him feel\ncuriously desolate. Because, although he supposed he liked her in a\nremote kind of way, he had no fondness for her--or she, he knew, for\nhim.\n\n\"Well, five years is rather a long stretch for any girl to spend in\nexile,\" Raymond explained, \"even though our life spans are a bit longer\nthan yours. Besides, you're getting too old now to be under petticoat\ngovernment.\" He looked inquisitively at Martin. \"You're not going to\ngo all weepy and make a scene when she leaves, are you?\"\n\n\"No....\" Martin said hesitantly. \"Oh, I suppose I will miss her. But we\naren't very close, so it won't make a real difference.\" That was the\nsad part: he already knew it wouldn't make a difference.\n\nRaymond clapped him on the shoulder. \"I knew you weren't a sloppy\nsentimentalist like Conrad. Though you do have rather a look of him,\nyou know.\"\n\nSuddenly that seemed to make Conrad real. Martin felt a vague stirring\nof alarm. He kept his voice composed, however. \"How do you plan to\nprotect me when he comes?\"\n\n\"Well, each one of us is armed to the teeth, of course,\" Raymond said\nwith modest pride, displaying something that looked like a child's\ncombination spaceman's gun and death ray, but which, Martin had no\ndoubt, was a perfectly genuine--and lethal--weapon. \"And we've got a\nrather elaborate burglar alarm system.\"\n\nMartin inspected the system and made one or two changes in the wiring\nwhich, he felt, would increase its efficiency. But still he was\ndubious. \"Maybe it'll work on someone coming from outside this _house_,\nbut do you think it will work on someone coming from outside this\n_time_?\"\n\n\"Never fear--it has a temporal radius,\" Raymond replied. \"Factory\nguarantee and all that.\"\n\n\"Just to be on the safe side,\" Martin said, \"I think I'd better have\none of those guns, too.\"\n\n\"A splendid idea!\" enthused Raymond. \"I was just about to think of that\nmyself!\"\n\n\n\nWhen it came time for the parting, it was Ninian who cried--tears at\nher own inadequacy, Martin knew, not of sorrow. He was getting skillful\nat understanding his descendants, far better than they at understanding\nhim. But then they never really tried. Ninian kissed him wetly on the\ncheek and said she was sure everything would work out all right and\nthat she'd come see him again. She never did, though, except at the\nvery last.\n\nRaymond and Martin moved into a luxurious mansion in a remote area. The\nsite proved a well-chosen one; when the Second Atomic War came, half a\ndozen years later, they weren't touched. Martin was never sure whether\nthis had been sheer luck or expert planning. Probably luck, because his\ndescendants were exceedingly inept planners.\n\nFew people in the world then could afford to live as stylishly as\nMartin and his guardian. The place not only contained every possible\nconvenience and gadget but was crammed with bibelots and antiques,\ncarefully chosen by Raymond and disputed by Martin, for, to the man\nfrom the future, all available artifacts were antiques. Otherwise,\nMartin accepted his new surroundings. His sense of wonder had become\ndulled by now and the pink pseudo-Spanish castle--\"architecturally\ndreadful, of course,\" Raymond had said, \"but so hilariously\ntypical\"--impressed him far less than had the suburban split-level\naquarium.\n\n\"How about a moat?\" Martin suggested when they first came. \"It seems to\ngo with a castle.\"\n\n\"Do you think a moat could stop Conrad?\" Raymond asked, amused.\n\n\"No,\" Martin smiled, feeling rather silly, \"but it would make the place\nseem safer somehow.\"\n\nThe threat of Conrad was beginning to make him grow more and more\nnervous. He got Raymond's permission to take two suits of armor that\nstood in the front hall and present them to a local museum, because\nseveral times he fancied he saw them move. He also became an adept with\nthe ray gun and changed the surrounding landscape quite a bit with it,\nuntil Raymond warned that this might lead Conrad to them.\n\nDuring those early years, Martin's tutors were exchanged for the\nhigher-degreed ones that were now needful. The question inevitably\narose of what the youth's vocation in that life was going to be. At\nleast twenty of the cousins came back through time to hold one of\ntheir vigorous family councils. Martin was still young enough to enjoy\nsuch occasions, finding them vastly superior to all other forms of\nentertainment.\n\n\n\n\"This sort of problem wouldn't arise in our day, Martin,\" Raymond\ncommented as he took his place at the head of the table, \"because,\nunless one specifically feels a call to some profession or other, one\njust--well, drifts along happily.\"\n\n\"Ours is a wonderful world,\" Grania sighed at Martin. \"I only wish we\ncould take you there. I'm sure you would like it.\"\n\n\"Don't be a fool, Grania!\" Raymond snapped. \"Well, Martin, have you\nmade up your mind what you want to be?\"\n\nMartin affected to think. \"A physicist,\" he said, not without malice.\n\"Or perhaps an engineer.\"\n\nThere was a loud, excited chorus of dissent. He chuckled inwardly.\n\n\"Can't do that,\" Ives said. \"Might pick up some concepts from us. Don't\nknow how; none of us knows a thing about science. But it could happen.\nSubconscious osmosis, if there is such a thing. That way, you might\ninvent something ahead of time. And the fellow we got the plans from\nparticularly cautioned us against that. Changing history. Dangerous.\"\n\n\"Might mess up our time frightfully,\" Bartholomew contributed, \"though,\nto be perfectly frank, I can't quite understand how.\"\n\n\"I am not going to sit down and explain the whole thing to you all over\nagain, Bart!\" Raymond said impatiently. \"Well, Martin?\"\n\n\"What would you suggest?\" Martin asked.\n\n\"How about becoming a painter? Art is eternal. And quite gentlemanly.\nBesides, artists are always expected to be either behind or ahead of\ntheir times.\"\n\n\"Furthermore,\" Ottillie added, \"one more artist couldn't make much\ndifference in history. There were so many of them all through the ages.\"\n\nMartin couldn't hold back his question. \"What was I, actually, in that\nother time?\"\n\nThere was a chilly silence.\n\n\"Let's not talk about it, dear,\" Lalage finally said. \"Let's just be\nthankful we've saved you from _that_!\"\n\nSo drawing teachers were engaged and Martin became a very competent\nsecond-rate artist. He knew he would never be able to achieve first\nrank because, even though he was still so young, his work was almost\npurely intellectual. The only emotion he seemed able to feel was\nfear--the ever-present fear that someday he would turn a corridor and\nwalk into a man who looked like him--a man who wanted to kill him for\nthe sake of an ideal.\n\nBut the fear did not show in Martin's pictures. They were pretty\npictures.\n\n\n\nCousin Ives--now that Martin was older, he was told to call the\ndescendants _cousin_--next assumed guardianship. Ives took his\nresponsibilities more seriously than the others did. He even arranged\nto have Martin's work shown at an art gallery. The paintings received\ncritical approval, but failed to evoke any enthusiasm. The modest\nsale they enjoyed was mostly to interior decorators. Museums were not\ninterested.\n\n\"Takes time,\" Ives tried to reassure him. \"One day they'll be buying\nyour pictures, Martin. Wait and see.\"\n\nIves was the only one of the descendants who seemed to think of Martin\nas an individual. When his efforts to make contact with the other young\nman failed, he got worried and decided that what Martin needed was a\nchange of air and scenery.\n\n\"'Course you can't go on the Grand Tour. Your son hasn't invented\nspace travel yet. But we can go see this world. What's left of it.\nTourists always like ruins best, anyway.\"\n\nSo he drew on the family's vast future resources and bought a yacht,\nwhich Martin christened _The Interregnum_. They traveled about from sea\nto ocean and from ocean to sea, touching at various ports and making\ntrips inland. Martin saw the civilized world--mostly in fragments; the\nnearly intact semi-civilized world and the uncivilized world, much the\nsame as it had been for centuries. It was like visiting an enormous\nmuseum; he couldn't seem to identify with his own time any more.\n\nThe other cousins appeared to find the yacht a congenial head-quarters,\nlargely because they could spend so much time far away from the\ncontemporary inhabitants of the planet and relax and be themselves. So\nthey never moved back to land. Martin spent the rest of his life on\n_The Interregnum_. He felt curiously safer from Conrad there, although\nthere was no valid reason why an ocean should stop a traveler through\ntime.\n\nMore cousins were in residence at once than ever before, because\nthey came for the ocean voyage. They spent most of their time aboard\nship, giving each other parties and playing an _avant-garde_ form of\nshuffleboard and gambling on future sporting events. That last usually\nended in a brawl, because one cousin was sure to accuse another of\nhaving got advance information about the results.\n\nMartin didn't care much for their company and associated with them only\nwhen not to have done so would have been palpably rude. And, though\nthey were gregarious young people for the most part, they didn't court\nhis society. He suspected that he made them feel uncomfortable.\n\n\n\nHe rather liked Ives, though. Sometimes the two of them would be alone\ntogether; then Ives would tell Martin of the future world he had come\nfrom. The picture drawn by Raymond and Ninian had not been entirely\naccurate, Ives admitted. True, there was no war or poverty on Earth\nproper, but that was because there were only a couple of million people\nleft on the planet. It was an enclave for the highly privileged, highly\ninterbred aristocracy, to which Martin's descendants belonged by virtue\nof their distinguished ancestry.\n\n\"Rather feudal, isn't it?\" Martin asked.\n\nIves agreed, adding that the system had, however, been deliberately\nplanned, rather than the result of haphazard natural development.\nEverything potentially unpleasant, like the mercantiles, had been\ndeported.\n\n\"Not only natives livin' on the other worlds,\" Ives said as the two\nof them stood at the ship's rail, surrounded by the limitless expanse\nof some ocean or other. \"People, too. Mostly lower classes, except\nfor officials and things. With wars and want and suffering,\" he added\nregretfully, \"same as in your day.... Like now, I mean,\" he corrected\nhimself. \"Maybe it _is_ worse, the way Conrad thinks. More planets\nfor us to make trouble on. Three that were habitable aren't any more.\nBombed. Very thorough job.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Martin murmured, trying to sound shocked, horrified--interested,\neven.\n\n\"Sometimes I'm not altogether sure Conrad was wrong,\" Ives said, after\na pause. \"Tried to keep us from getting to the stars, hurting the\npeople--I expect you could call them people--there. Still--\" he smiled\nshamefacedly--\"couldn't stand by and see my own way of life destroyed,\ncould I?\"\n\n\"I suppose not,\" Martin said.\n\n\"Would take moral courage. I don't have it. None of us does, except\nConrad, and even he--\" Ives looked out over the sea. \"Must be a better\nway out than Conrad's,\" he said without conviction. \"And everything\nwill work out all right in the end. Bound to. No sense to--to anything,\nif it doesn't.\" He glanced wistfully at Martin.\n\n\"I hope so,\" said Martin. But he couldn't hope; he couldn't feel; he\ncouldn't even seem to care.\n\nDuring all this time, Conrad still did not put in an appearance. Martin\nhad gotten to be such a crack shot with the ray pistol that he almost\nwished his descendant would show up, so there would be some excitement.\nBut he didn't come. And Martin got to thinking....\n\nHe always felt that if any of the cousins could have come to realize\nthe basic flaw in the elaborate plan they had concocted, it would have\nbeen Ives. However, when the yacht touched at Tierra del Fuego one\nbitter winter, Ives took a severe chill. They sent for a doctor from\nthe future--one of the descendants who had been eccentric enough to\ntake a medical degree--but he wasn't able to save Ives. The body was\nburied in the frozen ground at Ushuaia, on the southern tip of the\ncontinent, a hundred years or more before the date of his birth.\n\nA great many of the cousins turned up at the simple ceremony. All were\ndressed in overwhelming black and showed a great deal of grief. Raymond\nread the burial service, because they didn't dare summon a clerical\ncousin from the future; they were afraid he might prove rather stuffy\nabout the entire undertaking.\n\n\"He died for all of us,\" Raymond concluded his funeral eulogy over\nIves, \"so his death was not in vain.\"\n\nBut Martin disagreed.\n\n\n\nThe ceaseless voyaging began again. _The Interregnum_ voyaged to every\nocean and every sea. Some were blue and some green and some dun. After\na while, Martin couldn't tell one from another. Cousin after cousin\ncame to watch over him and eventually they were as hard for him to tell\napart as the different oceans.\n\nAll the cousins were young, for, though they came at different times in\nhis life, they had all started out from the same time in theirs. Only\nthe young ones had been included in the venture; they did not trust\ntheir elders.\n\nAs the years went by, Martin began to lose even his detached interest\nin the land and its doings. Although the yacht frequently touched port\nfor fuel or supplies--it was more economical to purchase them in that\nera than to have them shipped from the future--he seldom went ashore,\nand then only at the urging of a newly assigned cousin anxious to see\nthe sights. Most of the time Martin spent in watching the sea--and\nsometimes he painted it. There seemed to be a depth to his seascapes\nthat his other work lacked.\n\nWhen he was pressed by the current cousin to make a land visit\nsomewhere, he decided to exhibit a few of his sea paintings. That way,\nhe could fool himself into thinking that there was some purpose to this\njourney. He'd come to believe that perhaps what his life lacked was\npurpose, and for a while he kept looking for meaning everywhere, to the\ncousin's utter disgust.\n\n\"Eat, drink and be merry, or whatever you Romans say when you do as you\ndo,\" the cousin--who was rather woolly in history; the descendants were\nscraping bottom now--advised.\n\nMartin showed his work in Italy, so that the cousin could be\ndisillusioned by the current crop of Romans. He found that neither\npurpose nor malice was enough; he was still immeasurably bored.\nHowever, a museum bought two of the paintings. Martin thought of Ives\nand felt an uncomfortable pang of a sensation he could no longer\nunderstand.\n\n\"Where do you suppose Conrad has been all this time?\" Martin idly asked\nthe current cousin--who was passing as his nephew by now.\n\nThe young man jumped, then glanced around him uncomfortably. \"Conrad's\na very shrewd fellow,\" he whispered. \"He's biding his time--waiting\nuntil we're off guard. And then--pow!--he'll attack!\"\n\n\"Oh, I see,\" Martin said.\n\nHe had often fancied that Conrad would prove to be the most stimulating\nmember of the whole generation. But it seemed unlikely that he would\never have a chance for a conversation with the young man. More than one\nconversation, anyhow.\n\n\"When he does show up, I'll protect you,\" the cousin vowed, touching\nhis ray gun. \"You haven't a thing to worry about.\"\n\nMartin smiled with all the charm he'd had nothing to do but acquire. \"I\nhave every confidence in you,\" he told his descendant. He himself had\ngiven up carrying a gun long ago.\n\nThere was a war in the Northern Hemisphere and so _The Interregnum_\nvoyaged to southern waters. There was a war in the south and they hid\nout in the Arctic. All the nations became too drained of power--fuel\nand man and will--to fight, so there was a sterile peace for a long\ntime. _The Interregnum_ roamed the seas restlessly, with her load of\npassengers from the future, plus one bored and aging contemporary. She\nbore big guns now, because of the ever-present danger of pirates.\n\n\n\nPerhaps it was the traditionally bracing effect of sea air--perhaps it\nwas the sheltered life--but Martin lived to be a very old man. He was a\nhundred and four when his last illness came. It was a great relief when\nthe family doctor, called in again from the future, said there was no\nhope. Martin didn't think he could have borne another year of life.\n\nAll the cousins gathered at the yacht to pay their last respects to\ntheir progenitor. He saw Ninian again, after all these years, and\nRaymond--all the others, dozens of them, thronging around his bed,\nspilling out of the cabin and into the passageways and out onto the\ndeck, making their usual clamor, even though their voices were hushed.\n\nOnly Ives was missing. He'd been the lucky one, Martin knew. He had\nbeen spared the tragedy that was going to befall these blooming young\npeople--all the same age as when Martin had last seen them and doomed\nnever to grow any older. Underneath their masks of woe, he could see\nrelief at the thought that at last they were going to be rid of their\nresponsibility. And underneath Martin's death mask lay an impersonal\npity for those poor, stupid descendants of his who had blundered so\nirretrievably.\n\nThere was only one face which Martin had never seen before. It wasn't\na strange face, however, because Martin had seen one very like it in\nthe looking glass when he was a young man.\n\n\"You must be Conrad,\" Martin called across the cabin in a voice that\nwas still clear. \"I've been looking forward to meeting you for some\ntime.\"\n\nThe other cousins whirled to face the newcomer.\n\n\"You're too late, Con,\" Raymond gloated for the whole generation. \"He's\nlived out his life.\"\n\n\"But he hasn't lived out his life,\" Conrad contradicted. \"He's lived\nout the life _you_ created for him. And for yourselves, too.\"\n\nFor the first time, Martin saw compassion in the eyes of one of his\nlineage and found it vaguely disturbing. It didn't seem to belong there.\n\n\"Don't you realize even yet,\" Conrad went on, \"that as soon as he goes,\nyou'll go, too--present, past, future, wherever you are, you'll go up\nin the air like puffs of smoke?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Ninian quavered, her soft, pretty face alarmed.\n\nMartin answered Conrad's rueful smile, but left the explanations up to\nhim. It was his show, after all.\n\n\"Because you will never have existed,\" Conrad said. \"You have no right\nto existence; it was you yourselves who watched him all the time,\nso he didn't have a chance to lead a normal life, get married, _have\nchildren_....\"\n\n\n\nMost of the cousins gasped as the truth began to percolate through.\n\n\"I knew from the very beginning,\" Conrad finished, \"that I didn't\nhave to do anything at all. I just had to wait and you would destroy\nyourselves.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Bartholomew protested, searching the faces of the\ncousins closest to him. \"What does he mean, we have never existed?\nWe're here, aren't we? What--\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" Raymond snapped. He turned on Martin. \"You don't seem\nsurprised.\"\n\nThe old man grinned. \"I'm not. I figured it all out years ago.\"\n\nAt first, he had wondered what he should do. Would it be better to\nthrow them into a futile panic by telling them or to do nothing? He\nhad decided on the latter; that was the role they had assigned him--to\nwatch and wait and keep out of things--and that was the role he would\nplay.\n\n\"You knew all the time and you didn't tell us!\" Raymond spluttered.\n\"After we'd been so good to you, making a gentleman out of you instead\nof a criminal.... That's right,\" he snarled, \"a criminal! An alcoholic,\na thief, a derelict! How do you like that?\"\n\n\"Sounds like a rich, full life,\" Martin said wistfully.\n\nWhat an exciting existence they must have done him out of! But then, he\ncouldn't help thinking, he--he and Conrad together, of course--had done\nthem out of _any_ kind of existence. It wasn't his responsibility,\nthough; he had done nothing but let matters take whatever course was\ndestined for them. If only he could be sure that it was the better\ncourse, perhaps he wouldn't feel that nagging sense of guilt inside\nhim. Strange--where, in his hermetic life, could he possibly have\ndeveloped such a queer thing as a conscience?\n\n\"Then we've wasted all this time,\" Ninian sobbed, \"all this energy, all\nthis money, for nothing!\"\n\n\"But you were nothing to begin with,\" Martin told them. And then,\nafter a pause, he added, \"I only wish I could be sure there had been\nsome purpose to this.\"\n\nHe didn't know whether it was approaching death that dimmed his sight,\nor whether the frightened crowd that pressed around him was growing\nshadowy.\n\n\"I wish I could feel that some good had been done in letting you be\nwiped out of existence,\" he went on voicing his thoughts. \"But I know\nthat the same thing that happened to your worlds and my world will\nhappen all over again. To other people, in other times, but again. It's\nbound to happen. There isn't any hope for humanity.\"\n\nOne man couldn't really change the course of human history, he told\nhimself. Two men, that was--one real, one a shadow.\n\nConrad came close to the old man's bed. He was almost transparent.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"there is hope. They didn't know the time transmitter\nworks two ways. I used it for going into the past only once--just this\nonce. But I've gone into the future with it many times. And--\" he\npressed Martin's hand--\"believe me, what I did--what _we_ did, you and\nI--serves a purpose. It will change things for the better. Everything\nis going to be all right.\"\n\n\n\nWas Conrad telling him the truth, Martin wondered, or was he just\ngiving the conventional reassurance to the dying? More than that, was\nhe trying to convince himself that what he had done was the right\nthing? Every cousin had assured Martin that things were going to be all\nright.\n\nWas Conrad _actually_ different from the rest?\n\nHis plan had worked and the others' hadn't, but then all his plan had\nconsisted of was doing nothing. That was all he and Martin had done ...\nnothing. Were they absolved of all responsibility merely because they\nhad stood aside and taken advantage of the others' weaknesses?\n\n\"Why,\" Martin said to himself, \"in a sense, it could be said that I\nhave fulfilled my original destiny--that I am a criminal.\"\n\nWell, it didn't matter; whatever happened, no one could hold him to\nblame. He held no stake in the future that was to come. It was other\nmen's future--other men's problem. He died very peacefully then, and,\nsince he was the only one left on the ship, there was nobody to bury\nhim.\n\nThe unmanned yacht drifted about the seas for years and gave rise to\nmany legends, none of them as unbelievable as the truth.",
