    "body": "By A. Conan Doyle\n\n\n\"Number 481 is no better, doctor,\" said the head-warder, in a slightly\nreproachful accent, looking in round the corner of my door.\n\n\"Confound 481\" I responded from behind the pages of the _Australian\nSketcher_.\n\n\"And 61 says his tubes are paining him. Couldn't you do anything for\nhim?\"\n\n\"He is a walking drug-shop,\" said I. \"He has the whole British\npharmacopaae inside him. I believe his tubes are as sound as yours are.\"\n\n\"Then there's 7 and 108, they are chronic,\" continued the warder,\nglancing down a blue slip of paper. \"And 28 knocked off work\nyesterday--said lifting things gave him a stitch in the side. I want you\nto have a look at him, if you don't mind, doctor. There's 81, too--him\nthat killed John Adamson in the Corinthian brig--he's been carrying on\nawful in the night, shrieking and yelling, he has, and no stopping him\neither.\"\n\n\"All right, I'll have a look at him afterward,\" I said, tossing my paper\ncarelessly aside, and pouring myself out a cup of coffee. \"Nothing else\nto report, I suppose, warder?\"\n\nThe official protruded his head a little further into the room. \"Beg\npardon, doctor,\" he said, in a confidential tone, \"but I notice as 82\nhas a bit of a cold, and it would be a good excuse for you to visit him\nand have a chat, maybe.\"\n\nThe cup of coffee was arrested half-way to my lips as I stared in\namazement at the man's serious face.\n\n\"An excuse?\" I said. \"An excuse? What the deuce are you talking about,\nMcPherson? You see me trudging about all day at my practise, when I'm\nnot looking after the prisoners, and coming back every night as tired as\na dog, and you talk about finding an excuse for doing more work.\"\n\n\"You'd like it, doctor,\" said Warder McPherson, insinuating one of his\nshoulders into the room. \"That man's story's worth listening to if you\ncould get him to tell it, though he's not what you'd call free in his\nspeech. Maybe you don't know who 82 is?\"\n\n\"No, I don't, and I don't care either,\" I answered, in the conviction\nthat some local ruffian was about to be foisted upon me as a celebrity.\n\n\"He's Maloney,\" said the warder, \"him that turned Queen's evidence after\nthe murders at Bluemansdyke.\"\n\n\"You don't say so?\" I ejaculated, laying down my cup in astonishment. I\nhad heard of this ghastly series of murders, and read an account of\nthem in a London magazine long before setting foot in the colony. I\nremembered that the atrocities committed had thrown the Burke and Hare\ncrimes completely into the shade, and that one of the most villainous\nof the gang had saved his own skin by betraying his companions. \"Are you\nsure?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, yes, it's him right enough. Just you draw him out a bit, and\nhe'll astonish you. He's a man to know, is Maloney; that's to say, in\nmoderation;\" and the head grinned, bobbed, and disappeared, leaving me\nto finish my breakfast and ruminate over what I had heard.\n\nThe surgeonship of an Australian prison is not an enviable position. It\nmay be endurable in Melbourne or Sydney, but the little town of Perth\nhas few attractions to recommend it, and those few had been long\nexhausted. The climate was detestable, and the society far from\ncongenial. Sheep and cattle were the staple support of the community;\nand their prices, breeding, and diseases the principal topic of\nconversation. Now as I, being an outsider, possessed neither the one nor\nthe other, and was utterly callous to the new \"dip\" and the \"rot\" and\nother kindred topics, I found myself in a state of mental isolation,\nand was ready to hail anything which might relieve the monotony of my\nexistence. Maloney, the murderer, had at least some distinctiveness and\nindividuality in his character, and might act as a tonic to a mind sick\nof the commonplaces of existence. I determined that I should follow the\nwarder's advice, and take the excuse for making his acquaintance. When,\ntherefore, I went upon my usual matutinal round, I turned the lock of\nthe door which bore the convict's number upon it, and walked into the\ncell.\n\nThe man was lying in a heap upon his rough bed as I entered, but,\nuncoiling his long limbs, he started up and stared at me with an\ninsolent look of defiance on his face which augured badly for our\ninterview. He had a pale, set face, with sandy hair and a steely-blue\neye, with something feline in its expression. His frame was tall and\nmuscular, though there was a curious bend in his shoulders, which almost\namounted to a deformity. An ordinary observer meeting him in the street\nmight have put him down as a well-developed man, fairly handsome, and\nof studious habits--even in the hideous uniform of the rottenest convict\nestablishment he imparted a certain refinement to his carriage which\nmarked him out among the inferior ruffians around him.\n\n\"I'm not on the sick-list,\" he said, gruffly. There was something in the\nhard, rasping voice which dispelled all softer illusions, and made me\nrealize that I was face to face with the man of the Lena Valley and\nBluemansdyke, the bloodiest bushranger that ever stuck up a farm or cut\nthe throats of its occupants.\n\n\"I know you're not,\" I answered. \"Warder McPherson told me you had a\ncold, though, and I thought I'd look in and see you.\"\n\n\"Blast Warder McPherson, and blast you, too!\" yelled the convict, in\na paroxysm of rage. \"Oh, that's right,\" he added in a quieter voice;\n\"hurry away; report me to the governor, do! Get me another six months or\nso--that's your game.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to report you,\" I said.\n\n\"Eight square feet of ground,\" he went on, disregarding my protest, and\nevidently working himself into a fury again. \"Eight square feet, and I\ncan't have that without being talked to and stared at, and--oh, blast\nthe whole crew of you!\" and he raised his two clinched hands above, his\nhead and shook them in passionate invective.\n\n\"You've got a curious idea of hospitality,\" I remarked, determined not\nto lose my temper, and saying almost the first thing that came to my\ntongue.\n\nTo my surprise the words had an extraordinary effect upon him. He seemed\ncompletely staggered at my assuming the proposition for which he had\nbeen so fiercely contending--namely, that the room in which he stood was\nhis own.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he said; \"I didn't mean to be rude. Won't you\ntake a seat?\" and he motioned toward a rough trestle, which formed the\nhead-piece of his couch.\n\nI sat down, rather astonished at the sudden change. I don't know that\nI liked Maloney better under this new aspect. The murderer had, it is\ntrue, disappeared for the nonce, but there was something in the smooth\ntones and obsequious manner which powerfully suggested the witness of\nthe queen, who had stood up and sworn away the lives of his companions\nin crime.\n\n\"How's your chest?\" I asked, putting on my professional air.\n\n\"Come, drop it, doctor--drop it!\" he answered, showing a row of white\nteeth as he resumed his seat upon the side of the bed. \"It wasn't\nanxiety after my precious health that brought you along here; that story\nwon't wash at all. You came to have a look at Wolf Tone Maloney, forger,\nmurderer, Sydney-slider, ranger, and government peach. That's about my\nfigure, ain't it? There it is, plain and straight; there's nothing mean\nabout me.\"\n\nHe paused as if he expected me to say something; but as I remained\nsilent, he repeated once or twice, \"There's nothing mean about me.\"\n\n\"And why shouldn't I?\" he suddenly yelled, his eyes gleaming and his\nwhole satanic nature reasserting itself. \"We were bound to swing, one\nand all, and they were none the worse if I saved myself by turning\nagainst them. Every man for himself, say I, and the devil take the\nluckiest. You haven't a plug of tobacco, doctor, have you?\"\n\nHe tore at the piece of \"Barrett's\" which I handed him, as ravenously as\na wild beast. It seemed to have the effect of soothing his nerves, for\nhe settled himself down in the bed and re-assumed his former deprecating\nmanner.\n\n\"You wouldn't like it yourself, you know, doctor,\" he said: \"it's enough\nto make any man a little queer in his temper. I'm in for six months this\ntime for assault, and very sorry I shall be to go out again, I can tell\nyou. My mind's at ease in here; but when I'm outside, what with the\ngovernment and what with Tattooed Tom, of Hawkesbury, there's no chance\nof a quiet life.\"\n\n\"Who is he?\" I asked.\n\n\"He's the brother of John Grimthorpe, the same that was condemned on my\nevidence; and an infernal scamp he was, too! Spawn of the devil, both of\nthem! This tattooed one is a murderous ruffian, and he swore to have my\nblood after that trial. It's seven year ago, and he's following me yet;\nI know he is, though he lies low and keeps dark. He came up to me in\nBallarat in '75; you can see on the back of my hand here where the\nbullet clipped me. He tried again in '76, at Port Philip, but I got the\ndrop on him and wounded him badly. He knifed me in '79, though, in a bar\nat Adelaide, and that made our account about level. He's loafing round\nagain now, and he'll let daylight into me--unless--unless by some\nextraordinary chance some one does as much for him.\" And Maloney gave a\nvery ugly smile.\n\n\"I don't complain of _him_ so much,\" he continued. \"Looking at it in\nhis way, no doubt it is a sort of family matter that can hardly be\nneglected. It's the government that fetches me. When I think of what\nI've done for this country, and then of what this country has done for\nme, it makes me fairly wild--clean drives me off my head. There's no\ngratitude nor common decency left, doctor!\"\n\nHe brooded over his wrongs for a few minutes, and then proceeded to lay\nthem before me in detail.\n\n\"Here's nine men,\" he said; \"they've been murdering and killing for\na matter of three years, and maybe a life a week wouldn't more than\naverage the work that they've done. The government catches them and the\ngovernment tries them, but they can't convict; and why?--because the\nwitnesses have all had their throats cut, and the whole job's been very\nneatly done. What happens then? Up comes a citizen called Wolf Tone\nMaloney; he says, 'The country needs me, and here I am.' And with that\nhe gives his evidence, convicts the lot, and enables the beaks to hang\nthem. That's what I did. There's nothing mean about me! And now what\ndoes the country do in return? Dogs me, sir, spies on me, watches me\nnight and day, turns against the very man that worked so very hard for\nit. There's something mean about that, anyway. I didn't expect them to\nknight me, nor to make me colonial secretary; but, damn it! I did expect\nthat they would let me alone!\"\n\n\"Well,\" I remonstrated, \"if you choose to break laws and assault people,\nyou can't expect it to be looked over on account of former services.\"\n\n\"I don't refer to my present imprisonment, sir,\" said Maloney, with\ndignity. \"It's the life I've been leading since that cursed trial that\ntakes the soul out of me. Just you sit there on that trestle, and I'll\ntell you all about it, and then look me in the face and tell me that\nI've been treated fair by the police.\"\n\nI shall endeavor to transcribe the experience of the convict in his own\nwords, as far as I can remember them, preserving his curious perversions\nof right and wrong. I can answer for the truth of his facts, whatever\nmay be said for his deductions from them. Months afterward, Inspector H.\nW. Hann, formerly governor of the jail at Dunedin, showed me entries in\nhis ledger which corroborated every statement Maloney reeled the story\noff in a dull, monotonous voice, with his head sunk upon his breast and\nhis hands between his knees. The glitter of his serpentlike eyes was the\nonly sign of the emotions which were stirred up by the recollection of\nthe events which he narrated.\n\n*****\n\nYou've read of Bluemansdyke (he began, with some pride in his tone).\nWe made it hot while it lasted; but they ran us to earth at last, and a\ntrap called Braxton, with a damned Yankee, took the lot of us. That was\nin New Zealand, of course, and they took us down to Dunedin, and there\nthey were convicted and hanged. One and all they put up their hands\nin the dock, and cursed me till your blood would have run cold to hear\nthem--which was scurvy treatment, seeing that we had all been\npals together; but they were a blackguard lot, and thought only of\nthemselves. I think it is as well that they were hung.\n\nThey took me back to Dunedin Jail, and clapped me into the old cell.\nThe only difference they made was, that I had no work to do and was\nwell fed. I stood this for a week or two, until one day the governor was\nmaking his rounds, and I put the matter to him.\n\n\"How's this?\" I said. \"My conditions were a free pardon, and you're\nkeeping me here against the law.\"\n\nHe gave a sort of a smile. \"Should you like very much to get out?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"So much,\" said I, \"that unless you open that door I'll have an action\nagainst you for illegal detention.\"\n\nHe seemed a bit astonished by my resolution.\n\n\"You're very anxious to meet your death,\" he said.\n\n\"What d'ye mean?\" I asked.\n\n\"Come here, and you'll know what I mean,\" he answered. And he led me\ndown the passage to a window that overlooked the door of the prison.\n\"Look at that!\" said he.\n\nI looked out, and there were a dozen or so rough-looking fellows\nstanding outside the street, some of them smoking, some playing cards\non the pavement. When they saw me they gave a yell and crowded round the\ndoor, shaking their fists and hooting.\n\n\"They wait for you, watch and watch about,\" said the governor. \"They're\nthe executive of the vigilance committee. However, since you are\ndetermined to go, I can't stop you.\"\n\n\"D'ye call this a civilized land,\" I cried, \"and let a man be murdered\nin cold blood in open daylight?\"\n\nWhen I said this the governor and the warder and every fool in the place\ngrinned, as if a man's life was a rare good joke.\n\n\"You've got the law on your side,\" says the governor; \"so we won't\ndetain you any longer. Show him out, warder.\"\n\nHe'd have done it, too, the black-hearted villain, if I hadn't begged\nand prayed and offered to pay for my board and lodging, which is\nmore than any prisoner ever did before me. He let me stay on those\nconditions; and for three months I was caged up there with every\nlarrikin in the township clamoring at the other side of the wall. That\nwas pretty treatment for a man that had served his country!\n\nAt last, one morning up came the governor again.\n\n\"Well, Maloney,\" he said, \"how long are you going to honor us with your\nsociety?\"\n\nI could have put a knife into his cursed body, and would, too, if we had\nbeen alone in the bush; but I had to smile, and smooth him and flatter,\nfor I feared that he might have me sent out.\n\n\"You're an infernal rascal,\" he said; those were his very words, to a\nman that had helped him all he knew how. \"I don't want any rough justice\nhere, though; and I think I see my way to getting you out of Dunedin.\"\n\n\"I'll never forget you, governor,\" said I; \"and, by God! I never will.\"\n\n\"I don't want your thanks nor your gratitude,\" he answered; \"it's\nnot for your sake that I do it, but simply to keep order in the town.\nThere's a steamer starts from the West Quay to Melbourne to-morrow, and\nwe'll get you aboard it. She is advertised at five in the morning, so\nhave yourself in readiness.\"\n\nI packed up the few things I had, and was smuggled out by a back door,\njust before daybreak. I hurried down, took my ticket under the name\nof Isaac Smith, and got safely aboard the Melbourne boat. I remember\nhearing her screw grinding into the water as the warps were cast loose,\nand looking back at the lights of Dunedin as I leaned upon the bulwarks,\nwith the pleasant thought that I was leaving them behind me forever.\nIt seemed to me that a new world was before me, and that all my troubles\nhad been cast off. I went down below and had some coffee, and came up\nagain feeling better than I had done since the morning that I woke\nto find that cursed Irishman that took me standing over me with a\nsix-shooter.\n\nDay had dawned by that time, and we were steaming along by the coast,\nwell out of sight of Dunedin. I loafed about for a couple of hours, and\nwhen the sun got well up some of the other passengers came on deck and\njoined me. One of them, a little perky sort of fellow, took a good long\nlook at me, and then came over and began talking.\n\n\"Mining, I suppose?\" says he.\n\n\"Yes,\" I says.\n\n\"Made your pile?\" he asks.\n\n\"Pretty fair,\" says I.\n\n\"I was at it myself,\" he says; \"I worked at the Nelson fields for three\nmonths, and spent all I made in buying a salted claim which busted up\nthe second day. I went at it again, though, and struck it rich; but when\nthe gold wagon was going down to the settlements, it was stuck up by\nthose cursed rangers, and not a red cent left.\"\n\n\"That was a bad job,\" I says.\n\n\"Broke me--ruined me clean. Never mind, I've seen them all hanged for\nit; that makes it easier to bear. There's only one left--the villain\nthat gave the evidence. I'd die happy if I could come across him. There\nare two things I have to do if I meet him.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" says I, carelessly.\n\n\"I've got to ask him where the money lies--they never had time to make\naway with it, and it's _cached_ somewhere in the mountains--and then\nI've got to stretch his neck for him, and send his soul down to join the\nmen that he betrayed.\"\n\nIt seemed to me that I knew something about that _cache_, and I felt\nlike laughing; but he was watching me, and it struck me that he had a\nnasty, vindictive kind of mind.\n\n\"I'm going up on the bridge,\" I said, for he was not a man whose\nacquaintance I cared much about making.\n\nHe wouldn't hear of my leaving him, though. \"We're both miners,\" he\nsays, \"and we're pals for the voyage. Come down to the bar. I'm not too\npoor to shout.\"\n\nI couldn't refuse him well, and we went down together; and that was the\nbeginning of the trouble. What harm was I doing any one on the ship?\nAll I asked for was a quiet life, leaving others alone and getting left\nalone myself. No man could ask fairer than that. And now just you listen\nto what came of it.\n\nWe were passing the front of the ladies' cabin, on our way to\nthe saloon, when out comes a servant lass--a freckled currency\nshe-devil--with a baby in her arms. We were brushing past her, when she\ngave a scream like a railway whistle, and nearly dropped the kid. My\nnerves gave a sort of a jump when I heard that scream, but I turned and\nbegged her pardon, letting on that I thought I might have trod on her\nfoot. I knew the game was up, though, when I saw her white face, and her\nleaning against the door and pointing.\n\n\"It's him!\" she cried; \"it's him! I saw him in the court-house. Oh,\ndon't let him hurt the baby!\"\n\n\"Who is it?\" asked the steward and half a dozen others in a breath.\n\n\"It's him--Maloney--Maloney, the murderer--oh, take him away--take him\naway!\"\n\nI don't rightly remember what happened just at that moment. The\nfurniture and me seemed to get kind of mixed, and there was cursing,\nand smashing, and some one shouting for his gold, and a general stamping\nround. When I got steadied a bit, I found somebody's hand in my mouth.\nFrom what I gathered afterward, I concluded that it belonged to that\nsame little man with the vicious way of talking. He got some of it out\nagain, but that was because the others were choking me. A poor chap can\nget no fair play in this world when once he is down--still, I think he\nwill remember me till the day of his death--longer, I hope.\n\nThey dragged me out on to the poop and held a damned court-martial--on\n_me_, mind you; _me_, that had thrown over my pals in order to serve\nthem. What were they to do with me? Some said this, some said that; but\nit ended by the captain deciding to send me ashore. The ship stopped,\nthey lowered a boat, and I was hoisted in, the whole gang of them\nhooting at me from over the bulwarks, I saw the man I spoke of tying up\nhis hand, though, and I felt that things might be worse.\n\nI changed my opinion before we got to the land. I had reckoned on the\nshore being deserted, and that I might make my way inland; but the ship\nhad stopped too near the Heads, and a dozen beach-combers and such like\nhad come down to the water's edge and were staring at us, wondering what\nthe boat was after. When we got to the edge of the surf the cockswain\nhailed them, and after singing out who I was, he and his men threw me\ninto the water. You may well look surprised--neck and crop into ten feet\nof water, with sharks as thick as green parrots in the bush, and I heard\nthem laughing as I floundered to the shore.\n\nI soon saw it was a worse job than ever. As I came scrambling out\nthrough the weeds, I was collared by a big chap with a velveteen coat,\nand half a dozen others got round me and held me fast. Most of them\nlooked simple fellows enough, and I was not afraid of them; but there\nwas one in a cabbage-tree hat that had a very nasty expression on his\nface, and the big man seemed to be chummy with him.\n\nThey dragged me up the beach, and then they let go their hold of me and\nstood round in a circle.\n\n\"Well, mate,\" says the man with the hat, \"we've been looking out for you\nsome time in these parts.\"\n\n\"And very good of you, too,\" I answers.\n\n\"None of your jaw,\" says he. \"Come, boys, what shall it be--hanging,\ndrowning, or shooting? Look sharp!\"\n\nThis looked a bit too like business. \"No, you don't!\" I said. \"I've got\ngovernment protection, and it'll be murder.\"\n\n\"That's what they call it,\" answered the one in the velveteen coat, as\ncheery as a piping crow.\n\n\"And you're going to murder me for being a ranger?\"\n\n\"Ranger be damned!\" said the man. \"We're going to hang you for peaching\nagainst your pals; and that's an end of the palaver.\"\n\nThey slung a rope round my neck and dragged me up to the edge of the\nbush. There were some big she-oaks and blue-gums, and they pitched on\none of these for the wicked deed. They ran the rope over a branch, tied\nmy hands, and told me to say my prayers. It seemed as if it was all up;\nbut Providence interfered to save me. It sounds nice enough sitting here\nand telling about it, sir; but it was sick work to stand with nothing\nbut the beach in front of you, and the long white line of surf, with the\nsteamer in the distance, and a set of bloody-minded villains round you\nthirsting for your life.\n\nI never thought I'd owe anything good to the police; but they saved\nme that time. A troop of them were riding from Hawkes Point Station to\nDunedin, and hearing that something was up, they came down through the\nbush and interrupted the proceedings. I've heard some bands in my time,\ndoctor, but I never heard music like the jingle of those traps' spurs\nand harness as they galloped out on to the open. They tried to hang me\neven then, but the police were too quick for them; and the man with the\nhat got one over the head with the flat of a sword. I was clapped on\nto a horse, and before evening I found myself in my old quarters in the\ncity jail.\n\nThe governor wasn't to be done, though. He was determined to get rid of\nme, and I was equally anxious to see the last of him. He waited a week\nor so until the excitement had begun to die away, and then he smuggled\nme aboard a three-masted schooner bound to Sydney with tallow and hides.\n\nWe got far away to sea without a hitch, and things began to look a bit\nmore rosy. I made sure that I had seen the last of the prison, anyway.\nThe crew had a sort of an idea who I was, and if there'd been any rough\nweather, they'd have hove me overboard, like enough; for they were a\nrough, ignorant lot, and had a notion that I brought bad luck to the\nship. We had a good passage, however, and I was landed safe and sound\nupon Sydney Quay.\n\nNow just you listen to what happened next. You'd have thought they would\nhave been sick of ill-using me and following me by this time--wouldn't\nyou, now? Well, just you listen. It seems that a cursed steamer started\nfrom Dunedin to Sydney on the very day we left, and got in before\nus, bringing news that I was coming. Blessed if they hadn't called a\nmeeting--a regular mass-meeting--at the docks to discuss about it, and\nI marched right into it when I landed. They didn't take long about\narresting me, and I listened to all the speeches and resolutions. If I'd\nbeen a prince there couldn't have been more excitement. The end of all\nwas that they agreed that it wasn't right that New Zealand should be\nallowed to foist her criminals upon her neighbors, and that I was to be\nsent back again by the next boat. So they posted me off again as if\nI was a damned parcel; and after another eight-hundred-mile journey I\nfound myself back for the third time moving in the place that I started\nfrom.\n\nBy this time I had begun to think that I was going to spend the rest of\nmy existence traveling about from one port to another. Every man's\nhand seemed turned against me, and there was no peace or quiet in any\ndirection. I was about sick of it by the time I had come back; and if\nI could have taken to the bush I'd have done it, and chanced it with my\nold pals. They were too quick for me, though, and kept me under lock and\nkey; but I managed, in spite of them, to negotiate that _cache_ I told\nyou of, and sewed the gold up in my belt. I spent another month in jail,\nand then they slipped me aboard a bark that was bound for England.\n\nThis time the crew never knew who I was, but the captain had a pretty\ngood idea, though he didn't let on to me that he had any suspicions.\nI guessed from the first that the man was a villain. We had a fair\npassage, except a gale or two off the Cape; and I began to feel like\na free man when I saw the blue loom of the old country, and the saucy\nlittle pilot-boat from Falmouth dancing toward us over the waves. We ran\ndown the Channel, and before we reached Gravesend I had agreed with the\npilot that he should take me ashore with him when he left. It was at\nthis time that the captain showed me that I was right in thinking him a\nmeddling, disagreeable man. I got my things packed, such as they were,\nand left him talking earnestly to the pilot, while I went below for my\nbreakfast. When I came up again we were fairly into the mouth of the\nriver, and the boat in which I was to have gone ashore had left us. The\nskipper said the pilot had forgotten me; but that was too thin, and I\nbegan to fear that all my old troubles were going to commence once more.\n\nIt was not long before my suspicions were confirmed. A boat darted out\nfrom the side of the river, and a tall cove with a long black beard came\naboard. I heard him ask the mate whether they didn't need a mud-pilot to\ntake them up in the reaches, but it seemed to me that he was a man who\nwould know a deal more about handcuffs than he did about steering, so\nI kept away from him. He came across the deck, however, and made\nsome remark to me, taking a good look at me the while. I don't like\ninquisitive people at any time, but an inquisitive stranger with glue\nabout the roots of his beard is the worst of all to stand, especially\nunder the circumstances. I began to feel that it was time for me to go.\n\nI soon got a chance, and made good use of it. A big collier came athwart\nthe bows of our steamer, and we had to slacken down to dead slow. There\nwas a barge astern, and I slipped down by a rope and was into the barge\nbefore any one missed me. Of course I had to leave my luggage behind me,\nbut I had the belt with the nuggets round my waist, and the chance of\nshaking the police off my track was worth more than a couple of boxes.\nIt was clear to me now that the pilot had been a traitor, as well as the\ncaptain, and had set the detectives after me. I often wish I could drop\nacross those two men again.\n\nI hung about the barge all day as she drifted down the stream. There was\none man in her, but she was a big, ugly craft, and his hands were too\nfull for much looking about. Toward evening, when it got a bit dusky, I\nstruck out for the shore, and found myself in a sort of marsh place, a\ngood many miles to the east of London. I was soaking wet and half\ndead with hunger, but I trudged into the town, got a new rig-out at a\nslop-shop, and after having some supper, engaged a bed at the quietest\nlodgings I could find.\n\nI woke pretty early--a habit you pick up in the bush--and lucky for me\nthat I did so. The very first thing I saw when I took a look through a\nchink in the shutter was one of these infernal policemen standing right\nopposite and staring up at the windows. He hadn't epaulets nor a sword,\nlike our traps, but for all that there was a sort of family likeness,\nand the same busybody expression. Whether they followed me all the time,\nor whether the woman that let me the bed didn't like the looks of me,\nis more than I have ever been able to find out. He came across as I was\nwatching him, and noted down the address of the house in a book. I was\nafraid that he was going to ring at the bell, but I suppose his orders\nwere simply to keep an eye on me, for after another good look at the\nwindows he moved on down the street.\n\nI saw that my only chance was to act at once. I threw on my clothes,\nopened the window softly, and, after making sure that there was nobody\nabout, dropped out onto the ground and made off as hard as I could run.\nI traveled a matter of two or three miles, when my wind gave out; and\nas I saw a big building with people going in and out, I went in too,\nand found that it was a railway station. A train was just going off\nfor Dover to meet the French boat, so I took a ticket and jumped into a\nthird-class carriage.\n\nThere were a couple of other chaps in the carriage, innocent-looking\nyoung beggars, both of them. They began speaking about this and that,\nwhile I sat quiet in the corner and listened. Then they started on\nEngland and foreign countries, and such like. Look ye now, doctor, this\nis a fact. One of them begins jawing about the justice of England's\nlaws. \"It's all fair and above-board,\" says he; \"there ain't any secret\npolice, nor spying, like they have abroad,\" and a lot more of the same\nsort of wash. Rather rough on me, wasn't it, listening to the damned\nyoung fool, with the police following me about like my shadow?\n\nI got to Paris right enough, and there I changed some of my gold, and\nfor a few days I imagined I'd shaken them off, and began to think of\nsettling down for a bit of rest. I needed it by that time, for I was\nlooking more like a ghost than a man. You've never had the police after\nyou, I suppose? Well, you needn't look offended, I didn't mean any harm.\nIf ever you had you'd know that it wastes a man away like a sheep with\nthe rot.\n\nI went to the opera one night and took a box, for I was very flush. I\nwas coming out between the acts when I met a fellow lounging along\nin the passage. The light fell on his face, and I saw that it was the\nmud-pilot that had boarded us in the Thames. His beard was gone, but I\nrecognized the man at a glance, for I've a good memory for faces.\n\nI tell you, doctor, I felt desperate for a moment. I could have knifed\nhim if we had been alone, but he knew me well enough never to give me\nthe chance. It was more than I could stand any longer, so I went right\nup to him and drew him aside, where we'd be free from all the loungers\nand theater-goers.\n\n\"How long are you going to keep it up?\" I asked him.\n\nHe seemed a bit flustered for a moment, but then he saw there was no use\nbeating about the bush, so he answered straight:\n\n\"Until you go back to Australia,\" he said.\n\n\"Don't you know,\" I said, \"that I have served the government and got a\nfree pardon?\"\n\nHe grinned all over his ugly face when I said this.\n\n\"We know all about you, Maloney,\" he answered. \"If you want a quiet\nlife, just you go back where you came from. If you stay here, you're a\nmarked man; and when you are found tripping it'll be a lifer for you,\nat the least. Free trade's a fine thing but the market's too full of men\nlike you for us to need to import any.\"\n\nIt seemed to me that there was something in what he said, though he had\na nasty way of putting it. For some days back I'd been feeling a sort of\nhomesick. The ways of the people weren't my ways. They stared at me in\nthe street; and if I dropped into a bar, they'd stop talking and edge\naway a bit, as if I was a wild beast. I'd sooner have had a pint of old\nStringybark, too, than a bucketful of their rot-gut liquors. There\nwas too much damned propriety. What was the use of having money if you\ncouldn't dress as you liked, nor bust in properly? There was no sympathy\nfor a man if he shot about a little when he was half-over, I've seen a\nman dropped at Nelson many a time with less row than they'd make over a\nbroken window-pane. The thing was slow, and I was sick of it.\n\n\"You want me to go back?\" I said.\n\n\"I've my order to stick fast to you until you do,\" he answered.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"I don't care if I do. All I bargain is that you keep\nyour mouth shut and don't let on who I am, so that I may have a fair\nstart when I get there.\"\n\nHe agreed to this, and we went over to Southampton the very next\nday, where he saw me safely off once more. I took a passage round to\nAdelaide, where no one was likely to know me; and there I settled, right\nunder the nose of the police. I'd been there ever since, leading a quiet\nlife, but for little difficulties like the one I'm in for now, and for\nthat devil, Tattooed Tom, of Hawkesbury. I don't know what made me\ntell you all this, doctor, unless it is that being lonely makes a man\ninclined to jaw when he gets a chance. Just you take warning from me,\nthough. Never put yourself out to serve your country; for your country\nwill do precious little for you. Just you let them look after their own\naffairs; and if they find difficulty in hanging a set of scoundrels,\nnever mind chipping in, but let them alone to do as best they can. Maybe\nthey'll remember how they treated me after I'm dead, and be sorry for\nneglecting me, I was rude to you when you came in, and swore a trifle\npromiscuous: but don't you mind me, it's only my way. You'll allow,\nthough, that I have cause to be a bit touchy now and again when I think\nof all that's passed. You're not going, are you? Well, if you must, you\nmust; but I hope you will look me up at odd times when you are going\nyour rounds. Oh, I say, you've left the balance of that cake of tobacco\nbehind you, haven't you? No; it's in your pocket--that's all right.\nThank ye, doctor, you're a good sort, and as quick at a hint as any man\nI've met.\n\nA couple of months after narrating his experiences, Wolf Tone Maloney\nfinished his term, and was released. For a long time I neither saw him\nnor heard of him, and he had almost slipped from my memory, until I\nwas reminded, in a somewhat tragic manner, of his existence. I had been\nattending a patient some distance off in the country, and was riding\nback, guiding my tired horse among the boulders which strewed the\npathway, and endeavoring to see my way through the gathering darkness,\nwhen I came suddenly upon a little wayside inn. As I walked my horse up\ntoward the door, intending to make sure of my bearings before proceeding\nfurther, I heard the sound of a violent altercation within the little\nbar.\n\nThere seemed to be a chorus of expostulation or remonstrance, above\nwhich two powerful voices rang out loud and angry. As I listened, there\nwas a momentary hush, two pistol shots sounded almost simultaneously,\nand with a crash the door burst open and a pair of dark figures\nstaggered out into the moonlight. They struggled for a moment in a\ndeadly wrestle, and then went down together among the loose stones.\nI had sprung off my horse, and, with the help of half a dozen rough\nfellows from the bar, dragged them away from one another.\n\nA glance was sufficient to convince me that one of them was dying fast.\nHe was a thick-set burly fellow, with a determined cast of countenance.\nThe blood was welling from a deep stab in his throat, and it was evident\nthat an important artery had been divided. I turned away from him in\ndespair, and walked over to where his antagonist was lying. He was shot\nthrough the lungs, but managed to raise himself up on his hand as I\napproached, and peered anxiously up into my face. To my surprise, I\nsaw before me the haggard features and flaxen hair of my prison\nacquaintance, Maloney.\n\n\"Ah, doctor!\" he said, recognizing me. \"How is he? Will he die?\"\n\nHe asked the question so earnestly that I imagined he had softened at\nthe last moment, and feared to leave the world with another homicide\nupon his conscience. Truth, however, compelled me to shake my head\nmournfully, and to intimate that the wound would prove a mortal one.\n\nMaloney gave a wild cry of triumph, which brought the blood welling\nout from between his lips. \"Here, boys,\" he gasped to the little group\naround him. \"There's money in my inside pocket. Damn the expense! Drinks\nround. There's nothing mean about me. I'd drink with you, but I'm going.\nGive the doc my share, for he's as good--\" Here his head fell back\nwith a thud, his eye glazed, and the soul of Wolf Tone Maloney, forger,\nconvict, ranger, murderer, and government peach, drifted away into the\nGreat Unknown.\n\nI cannot conclude without borrowing the account of the fatal quarrel\nwhich appeared in the column of the _West Australian Sentinel_. The\ncurious will find it in the issue of October 4,1881:\n\n     \"Fatal Affray.--W. T. Maloney, a well-know citizen of New\n     Montrose, and proprietor of the Yellow Boy gambling saloon,\n     has met with his death under rather painful circumstances.\n     Mr. Maloney was a man who had led a checkered existence, and\n     whose past history is replete with interest. Some of our\n     readers may recall the Lena Valley murders, in which he\n     figured as the principal criminal. It is conjectured that\n     during the seven months that he owned a bar in that region,\n     from twenty to thirty travelers were hocussed and made away\n     with.   He succeeded, however, in evading the vigilance of\n     the officers of the law, and allied himself with the\n     bushrangers of Bluemansdyke, whose heroic capture and\n     subsequent execution are matters of history. Maloney\n     extricated himself from the fate which awaited him by\n     turning Queen's evidence. He afterward visited Europe, but\n     returned to West Australia, where he has long played a\n     prominent part in local matters. On Friday evening he\n     encountered an old enemy, Thomas Grimthorpe, commonly known\n     as Tattooed Tom, of Hawkesbury.\n\n     \"Shots were exchanged, and both were badly wounded, only\n     surviving a few minutes. Mr. Maloney had the reputation of\n     being not only the most wholesale murderer that ever lived,\n     but also of having a finish and attention to detail in\n     matters of evidence which has been unapproached by any\n     European criminal. _Sic transit gloria mundi!_\"",
