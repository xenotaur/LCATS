    "body": "\n\nEASY MONEY\n\nA lad of about twenty stepped ashore from the schooner Jane, and joining\na girl, who had been avoiding for some ten minutes the ardent gaze of\nthe night-watchman, set off arm-in-arm.  The watchman rolled his eyes\nand shook his head slowly.\n\nNearly all his money on 'is back, he said, and what little bit 'e's got\nover he'll spend on 'er.  And three months arter they're married he'll\nwonder wot 'e ever saw in her.  If a man marries he wishes he 'adn't,\nand if he doesn't marry he wishes he 'ad.  That's life.\n\nLooking at them two young fools reminds me of a nevy of Sam Small's; a\nman I think I've spoke to you of afore.  As a rule Sam didn't talk much\nabout 'is relations, but there was a sister of 'is in the country wot 'e\nwas rather fond of because 'e 'adn't seen 'er for twenty years.  She 'ad\ngot a boy wot 'ad just got a job in London, and when 'e wrote and told\n'er he was keeping company with the handsomest and loveliest and best\n'arted gal in the whole wide world, she wrote to Sam about it and asked\n'im to give 'is nevy some good advice.\n\nSam 'ad just got back from China and was living with Peter Russet and\nGinger Dick as usual, and arter reading the letter about seven times and\nasking Ginger how 'e spelt \"minx,\" 'e read the letter out loud to them\nand asked 'em what they thought about it.\n\nGinger shook his 'ead, and, arter thinking a bit, Peter shook his too.\n\n\"She's caught 'im rather young,\" ses Ginger.\n\n\"They get it bad at that age too,\" ses Peter.  \"When I was twenty, there\nwas a gal as I was fond of, and a regiment couldn't ha' parted us.\"\n\n\"Wot did part you then?\"  ses Sam.\n\n\"Another gal,\" ses Peter; \"a gal I took a fancy to, that's wot did it.\"\n\n\"I was nearly married when I was twenty,\" ses Ginger, with a far-away\nlook in his eyes.  \"She was the most beautiful gal I ever saw in my\nlife; she 'ad one 'undred pounds a year of 'er own and she couldn't bear\nme out of her sight.  If a thump acrost the chest would do that cough of\nyours any good, Sam--\"\n\n\"Don't take no notice of 'im, Ginger,\" ses Peter.  \"Why didn't you marry\n'er?\"\n\n\"'Cos I was afraid she might think I was arter 'er money,\" ses Ginger,\ngetting a little bit closer to Sam.\n\nPeter 'ad another turn then, and him and Ginger kept on talking about\ngals whose 'arts they 'ad broke till Sam didn't know what to do with\n'imself.\n\n\"I'll just step round and see my nevy, while you and Peter are amusing\neach other,\" he ses at last.  \"I'll ask 'im to come round to-morrow and\nthen you can give 'im good advice.\"\n\nThe nevy came round next evening.  Bright, cheerful young chap 'e was,\nand he agreed with everything they said.  When Peter said as 'ow all\ngals was deceivers, he said he'd known it for years, but they was born\nthat way and couldn't 'elp it; and when Ginger said that no man ought to\nmarry afore he was fifty, he corrected 'im and made it fifty-five.\n\n\"I'm glad to 'ear you talk like that,\" ses Ginger.\n\n\"So am I,\" ses Peter.\n\n\"He's got his 'ead screwed on right,\" ses Sam, wot thought his sister\n'ad made a mistake.\n\n\"I'm surprised when I look round at the wimmen men 'ave married,\" ses\nthe nevy; \"wot they could 'ave seen in them I can't think.  Me and my\nyoung lady often laugh about it.\"\n\n\"Your wot?\" ses Sam, pretending to be very surprised.\n\n\"My young lady,\" ses the nevy.\n\nSam gives a cough.  \"I didn't know you'd got a young lady,\" he ses.\n\n\"Well, I 'ave,\" ses his nevy, \"and we're going to be married at\nChristmas.\"\n\n\"But--but you ain't fifty-five,\" ses Ginger.\n\n\"I'm twenty-one,\" ses the nevy, \"but my case is different.  There isn't\nanother young lady like mine in the world.  She's different to all the\nothers, and it ain't likely I'm going to let 'er be snapped up by\nsomebody else.  Fifty-five!  Why, 'ow I'm to wait till Christmas I don't\nknow.  She's the prettiest and handsomest gal in the world; and she's\nthe cleverest one I ever met.  You ought to hear 'er laugh.  Like music\nit is.  You'd never forget it.\"\n\n\"Twenty-one is young,\" ses Ginger, shaking his 'ead.  \"'Ave you known\n'er long?\"\n\n\"Three months,\" ses the nevy.  \"She lives in the same street as I do.\n'Ow it is she ain't been snapped up before, I can't think, but she told\nme that she didn't care for men till she saw me.\"\n\n\"They all say that,\" ses Ginger.\n\n\"If I've 'ad it said to me once, I've 'ad it said twenty times,\" ses\nPeter, nodding.\n\n\"They do it to flatter,\" ses old Sam, looking as if 'e knew all about\nit. \"You wait till you are my age, Joe; then you'll know; why I should\nha' been married dozens o' times if I 'adn't been careful.\"\n\n\"P'r'aps it was a bit on both sides,\" ses Joe, looking at 'is uncle.\n\"P'r'aps they was careful too.  If you only saw my young lady, you\nwouldn't talk like that.  She's got the truthfullest eyes in the world.\nLarge grey eyes like a child's, leastways sometimes they are grey and\nsometimes they are blue.  It seems to depend on the light somehow; I\n'ave seen them when they was a brown-brownish-gold.  And she smiles with\n'er eyes.\"\n\n\"Hasn't she got a mouth?\"  ses Ginger, wot was getting a bit tired of\nit.\n\n\"You've been crossed in love,\" ses the nevy, staring at 'im.  \"That's\nwot's the matter with you.  And looking at you, I don't wonder at it.\"\n\nGinger 'arf got up, but Sam gave him a look and 'e sat down agin, and\nthen they all sat quiet while the nevy went on telling them about 'is\ngal.\n\n\"I should like to see 'er,\" ses his uncle at last.\n\n\"Call round for me at seven to-morrow night,\" ses the young 'un, \"and\nI'll introduce you.\"\n\n\"We might look in on our way,\" ses Sam, arter Ginger and Peter 'ad both\nmade eyes at 'im.  \"We're going out to spend the evening.\"\n\n\"The more the merrier,\" ses his nevy.  \"Well, so long; I expect she's\nwaiting for me.\"\n\nHe got up and said good-bye, and arter he 'ad gorn, Sam and the other\ntwo shook their leads together and said what a pity it was to be twenty-\none. Ginger said it made 'im sad to think of it, and Peter said 'ow any\ngal could look at a man under thirty, 'e couldn't think.\n\nThey all went round to the nevy's the next evening.  They was a little\nbit early owing to Ginger's watch 'aving been set right by guess-work,\nand they 'ad to sit in a row on the nevy's bed waiting while 'e cleaned\n'imself, and changed his clothes.  Although it was only Wednesday 'e\nchanged his collar, and he was so long making up 'is mind about his\nnecktie that 'is uncle tried to make it up for him.  By the time he 'ad\nfinished Sam said it made 'im think it was Sunday.\n\nMiss Gill was at 'ome when they got there, and all three of 'em was very\nmuch surprised that such a good-looking gal should take up with Sam's\nnevy.  Ginger nearly said so, but Peter gave 'im a dig in the back just\nin time and 'e called him something under 'is breath instead.\n\n\"Why shouldn't we all make an evening of it?\" ses Ginger, arter they 'ad\nbeen talking for about ten minutes, and the nevy 'ad looked at the clock\nthree or four times.\n\n\"Because two's company,\" ses Mrs. Gill.  \"Why you was young yourself\nonce.  Can't you remember?\"\n\n\"He's young now, mother,\" ses the gal, giving Ginger a nice smile.\n\n\"I tell you wot we might do,\" ses Mrs. Gill, putting 'er finger to her\nforehead and considering.  \"You and Joe go out and 'ave your evening,\nand me and these gentlemen'll go off together somewhere.  I shall enjoy\nan outing; I ain't 'ad one for a long time.\"\n\nGinger said it would be very nice if she thought it wouldn't make 'er\ntoo tired, and afore Sam or Peter could think of anything to say, she\nwas upstairs putting 'er bonnet on.  They thought o' plenty to say while\nthey was sitting alone with Ginger waiting for 'er.\n\n\"My idea was for the gal and your nevy to come too,\" ses pore Ginger.\n\"Then I thought we might lose 'im and I would 'ave a little chat with\nthe gal, and show 'er 'ow foolish she was.\"\n\n\"Well, you've done it now,\" ses Sam.  \"Spoilt our evening.\"\n\n\"P'r'aps good will come out of it,\" ses Ginger.  \"If the old lady takes\na fancy to us we shall be able to come agin, and then to please you,\nSam, I'll have a go to cut your nevy out.\"\n\nSam stared at 'im, and Peter stared too, and then they looked at each\nother and began to laugh till Ginger forgot where 'e was and offered to\nput Sam through the winder.  They was still quarrelling under their\nbreath and saying wot they'd like to do to each other when Mrs. Gill\ncame downstairs.  Dressed up to the nines she was, and they walked down\nthe street with a feeling that everybody was looking at em.\n\nOne thing that 'elped to spoil the evening was that Mrs. Gill wouldn't\ngo into public'ouses, but to make up for it she went into sweet-stuff\nshops three times and 'ad ices while they stood and watched 'er and\nwondered 'ow she could do it.  And arter that she stopped at a place\nPoplar way, where there was a few swings and roundabouts and things.\nShe was as skittish as a school-gal, and arter taking pore Sam on the\nroundabout till 'e didn't know whether he was on his 'eels or his 'ead,\nshe got 'im into a boat-swing and swung 'im till he felt like a boy on\n'is fust v'y'ge.  Arter that she took 'im to the rifle gallery, and\nafore he had 'ad three shots the man took the gun away from 'im and\nthreatened to send for the police.\n\nIt was an expensive evening for all of them, but as Ginger said when\nthey got 'ome they 'ad broken the ice, and he bet Peter Russet 'arf a\ndollar that afore two days 'ad passed he'd take the nevy's gal for a\nwalk.  He stepped round by 'imself the next arternoon and made 'imself\nagreeable to Mrs. Gill, and the day arter they was both so nice and kind\nthat 'e plucked up 'is courage and offered to take Miss Gill to the Zoo.\n\nShe said \"No\" at fust, of course, but arter Ginger 'ad pointed out that\nJoe was at work all day and couldn't take 'er 'imself, and that 'e was\nJoe's uncle's best pal, she began to think better of it.\n\n\"Why not?\"  ses her mother.  \"Joe wouldn't mind.  He wouldn't be so\nsilly as to be jealous o' Mr. Ginger Dick.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" ses the gal.  \"There's nothing to be jealous of.\"\n\nShe let 'er mother and Ginger persuade 'er arter a time, and then she\nwent upstairs to clean herself, and put on a little silver brooch that\nGinger said he 'ad picked up coming along.\n\nShe took about three-quarters of an hour to get ready, but when she came\ndown, Ginger felt that it was quite worth it.  He couldn't take 'is eyes\noff 'er, as the saying goes, and 'e sat by 'er side on the top of the\nomnibus like a man in a dream.\n\n\"This is better than being at sea,\" he ses at last.\n\n\"Don't you like the sea?\"  ses the gal.  \"I should like to go to sea\nmyself.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't mind the sea if you was there,\" ses Ginger.\n\nMiss Gill turned her 'ead away.  \"You mustn't talk to me like that,\" she\nses in a soft voice.  \"Still--\"\n\n\"Still wot?\" ses Ginger, arter waiting a long time.\n\n\"I mean, if I did go to sea, it would be nice to have a friend on\nboard,\" she ses.  \"I suppose you ain't afraid of storms, are you?\"\n\n\"I like 'em,\" ses Ginger.\n\n\"You look as if you would,\" ses the gal, giving 'im a little look under\n'er eyelashes.  \"It must be nice to be a man and be brave.  I wish I was\na man.\"\n\n\"I don't,\" ses Ginger.\n\n\"Why not?\"  ses the gal, turning her 'ead away agin.\n\nGinger didn't answer, he gave 'er elbow a little squeeze instead.  She\ntook it away at once, and Ginger was just wishing he 'adn't been so\nfoolish, when it came back agin, and they sat for a long time without\nspeaking a word.\n\n\"The sea is all right for some things,\" ses Ginger at last, \"but suppose\na man married!\"\n\nThe gal shook her 'ead.  \"It would be hard on 'is wife,\" she ses, with\nanother little look at 'im, \"but--but----\"\n\nGinger pinched 'er elbow agin.\n\n\"But p'r'aps he could get a job ashore,\" she ses, \"and then he could\ntake his wife out for a bus-ride every day.\"\n\nThey 'ad to change buses arter a time, and they got on a wrong bus and\nwent miles out o' their way, but neither of 'em seemed to mind.  Ginger\nsaid he was thinking of something else, and the gal said she was too.\nThey got to the Zoological Gardens at last, and Ginger said he 'ad never\nenjoyed himself so much.  When the lions roared she squeezed his arm,\nand when they 'ad an elephant ride she was holding on to 'im with both\n'ands.\n\n\"I am enjoying myself,\" she ses, as Ginger 'elped her down and said\n\"whoa\" to the elephant.  \"I know it's wicked, but I can't 'elp it, and\nwot's more, I'm afraid I don't want to 'elp it.\"\n\nShe let Ginger take 'er arm when she nearly tripped up over a peppermint\nball some kid 'ad dropped; and, arter a little persuasion, she 'ad a\nbottle of lemonade and six bath-buns at a refreshment stall for dinner.\n\nShe was as nice as she could be to him, but by the time they started for\n'ome, she 'ad turned so quiet that Ginger began to think 'e must 'ave\noffended 'er in some way.\n\n\"Are you tired?\"  he ses.\n\n\"No,\" ses the gal, shaking her 'ead, \"I've enjoyed myself very much.\"\n\n\"I thought you seemed a bit tired,\" ses Ginger, arter waiting a long\ntime.\n\n\"I'm not tired,\" ses the gal, giving 'im a sad sort o' little smile,\n\"but I'm a little bit worried, that's all.\"\n\n\"Worried?\" ses Ginger, very tender.  \"Wot's worrying you?\"\n\n\"Oh, I can't tell you,\" ses Miss Gill.  \"It doesn't matter; I'll try and\ncheer up.  Wot a lovely day it is, isn't it?  I shall remember it all my\nlife.\"\n\n\"Wot is it worrying you?\"  ses Ginger, in a determined voice.  \"Can't\nyou tell me?\"\n\n\"No,\" ses the gal, shaking her 'ead, \"I can't tell you because you might\nwant to 'elp me, and I couldn't allow that.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't I 'elp you?\"  ses Ginger.  \"It's wot we was put 'ere for:\nto 'elp one another.\"\n\n\"I couldn't tell you,\" ses the gal, just dabbing at'er eyes--with a lace\npocket-'ankercher about one and a 'arf times the size of 'er nose.\n\n\"Not if I ask you to?\"  ses Ginger.\n\nMiss Gill shook 'er 'ead, and then she tried her 'ardest to turn the\nconversation.  She talked about the weather, and the monkey-'ouse, and a\ngal in 'er street whose 'air changed from red to black in a single\nnight; but it was all no good, Ginger wouldn't be put off, and at last\nshe ses--\n\n\"Well,\" she ses, \"if you must know, I'm in a difficulty; I 'ave got to\nget three pounds, and where to get it I don't know any more than the man\nin the moon.  Now let's talk about something else.\"\n\n\"Do you owe it?\"  ses Ginger.\n\n\"I can't tell you any more,\" ses Miss Gill, \"and I wouldn't 'ave told\nyou that only you asked me, and somehow I feel as though I 'ave to tell\nyou things, when you want me to.\"\n\n\"Three pounds ain't much,\" ses pore Ginger, wot 'ad just been paid off\narter a long v'y'ge.  \"I can let you 'ave it and welcome.\"\n\nMiss Gill started away from 'im as though she 'ad been stung, and it\ntook 'im all his time to talk 'er round agin.  When he 'ad she begged\n'is pardon and said he was the most generous man she 'ad ever met, but\nit couldn't be.\n\n\"I don't know when I could pay it back,\" she ses, \"but I thank you all\nthe same for offering it.\"\n\n\"Pay it back when you like,\" ses Ginger, \"and if you never pay it back,\nit don't matter.\"\n\nHe offered 'er the money four or five times, but she wouldn't take it,\nbut at last just as they got near her 'ouse he forced it in her 'and,\nand put his own 'ands in his pockets when she tried to make 'im take it\nback.\n\n\"You are good to me,\" she ses arter they 'ad gone inside and 'er mother\n'ad gone upstairs arter giving Ginger a bottle o' beer to amuse 'imself\nwith; \"I shall never forget you.  Never.\"\n\n\"I 'ope not,\" ses Ginger, starting.  \"Are you coming out agin to-\nmorrow?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I can't,\" ses Miss Gill, shaking her 'ead and looking\nsorrowful.\n\n\"Not with me?\"  ses Ginger, sitting down beside her on the sofa and\nputting 'is arm so that she could lean against it if she wanted to.\n\n\"I don't think I can,\" ses the gal, leaning back very gentle.\n\n\"Think agin,\" ses Ginger, squeezing 'er waist a little.\n\nMiss Gill shook her 'ead, and then turned and looked at 'im.  Her face\nwas so close to his, that, thinking that she 'ad put it there a-purpose,\nhe kissed it, and the next moment 'e got a clout that made his 'ead\nring.\n\n\"'Ow dare you!\" she ses, jumping up with a scream.  \"'Ow dare you!  'Ow\ndare----\"\n\n\"Wot's the matter?\"  ses her mother, coming downstairs like a runaway\nbarrel of treacle.\n\n\"He--he's insulted me,\" ses Miss Gill, taking out her little 'ankercher\nand sobbing.  \"He--k-kissed me!\"\n\n\"WOT!\"  ses Mrs. Gill.  \"Well, I'd never 'ave believed it!  Never!  Why\n'e ought to be taken up.  Wot d'ye mean by it?\"  she ses, turning on\npore Ginger.\n\nGinger tried to explain, but it was all no good, and two minutes\narterwards 'e was walking back to 'is lodgings like a dog with its tail\nbetween its legs.  His 'ead was going round and round with astonishment,\nand 'e was in such a temper that 'e barged into a man twice as big as\nhimself and then offered to knock his 'ead off when 'e objected.  And\nwhen Sam and Peter asked him 'ow he 'ad got on, he was in such a state\nof mind it was all 'e could do to answer 'em.\n\n\"And I'll trouble you for my 'arf dollar, Peter,\" he ses; \"I've been out\nwith 'er all day, and I've won my bet.\"\n\nPeter paid it over like a lamb, and then 'e sat thinking 'ard for a bit.\n\n\"Are you going out with 'er agin to-morrow, Ginger?\"  he ses, arter a\ntime.\n\n\"I don't know,\" ses Ginger, careless-like, \"I ain't made up my mind\nyet.\"\n\nPeter looked at 'im and then 'e looked at Sam and winked.  \"Let me 'ave\na try,\" he ses; \"I'll bet you another 'arf dollar that I take 'er out.\nP'r'aps I shall come 'ome in a better temper than wot you 'ave.\"\n\nOld Sam said it wasn't right to play with a gal's 'art in that way, but\narter a lot o' talking and telling Sam to shut up, Ginger took the bet.\nHe was quite certain in his own mind that Miss Gill would slam the door\nin Peter's face, and arter he 'ad started off next morning, Ginger and\nSam waited in to 'ave the pleasure of laughing in 'is face.\n\nThey got tired of waiting at last, and went out to enjoy themselves, and\nbreathe the fresh air in a pub down Poplar way.  They got back at seven\no'clock, and ten minutes arterwards Peter came in and sat down on his\nbed and began to smoke without a word.\n\n\"Had a good time?\"  ses Ginger.\n\n\"Rippin',\" ses Peter, holding 'is pipe tight between 'is teeth.  \"You\nowe me 'arf a dollar, Ginger.\"\n\n\"Where'd you go?\"  ses Ginger, passing it over.\n\n\"Crystal Pallis,\" ses Peter.\n\n\"Are you going to take 'er out to-morrow?\"  ses Sam.\n\n\"I don't think so,\" ses Peter, taking 'is pipe out of 'is mouth and\nyawning.  \"She's rather too young for me; I like talking to gals wot's a\nbit older.  I won't stand in Ginger's way.\"\n\n\"I found 'er a bit young too,\" ses Ginger.  \"P'r'aps we'd better let\nSam's nevy 'ave 'er.  Arter all it's a bit rough on 'im when you come to\nthink of it.\"\n\n\"You're quite right,\" ses Peter, jumping up.  \"It's Sam's business, and\nwhy we should go out of our way and inconvenience ourselves to do 'im a\ngood turn, I don't know.\"\n\n\"It's Sam all over,\" ses Ginger; \"he's always been like that, and the\nmore you try to oblige 'im, the more you may.\"\n\nThey went on abusing Sam till he got sick and tired of it, and arter\ntelling 'em wot he thought of 'em he slammed the door and went out and\nspent the evening by 'imself.  He would 'ardly speak to them next day,\nbut arter tea he brightened up a bit and they went off together as if\nnothing 'ad happened, and the fust thing they saw as they turned out of\ntheir street was Sam's nevy coming along smiling till it made their\nfaces ache to look at him.\n\n\"I was just coming to see you,\" he ses.\n\n\"We're just off on business,\" ses Ginger.\n\n\"I wasn't going to stop,\" ses the nevy; \"my young lady just told me to\nstep along and show uncle wot she has bought me.  A silver watch and\nchain and a gold ring.  Look at it!\"\n\nHe held his 'and under Ginger's nose, and Ginger stood there looking at\nit and opening and shutting 'is mouth like a dying fish.  Then he took\nPeter by the arm and led'im away while the nevy was opening 'is new\nwatch and showing Sam the works.\n\n\"'Ow much did she get out of you, Peter?\"  ses Ginger, looking at 'im\nvery hard.  \"I don't want any lies.\"\n\n\"Three quid,\" ses Peter, staring at 'im.\n\n\"Same 'ere,\" ses Ginger, grinding his teeth.  \"Did she give you a smack\non the side of your face?\"\n\n\"Wot--are--you--talking about, Ginger?\"  ses Peter.\n\n\"Did she smack your face too?\"  ses Ginger.\n\n\"Yes,\" ses Peter.",
