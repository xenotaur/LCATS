    "body": "Slowly, wearily, the yellow sun went down the sky. From the east the\nnight came on, as dark and as deep as the night that has no ending.\n\nThe last rays of the sun washed down over the planet, over the low\nrounded hills and the trees that grew on them, through the shallow\nvalleys where the grass grew rank and luxurious. The last songs of\nthe birds came undisturbed through the dusk. A deer snorted. From\nsomewhere came the bark of another animal, a bark that ended in a howl,\nlong-drawn and mournful.\n\nDawn world or dusk world?\n\nThe night flowed into the valleys, filled them with a mystic darkness.\nThe darkness crept to the tops of the low hills. Slowly it crept around\na huge ball that rested on top of the nearer hill. The ball, perhaps\nfifty feet in diameter, lifted a foot from the ground. It quivered,\nlifted two feet, then slowly settled back to earth.\n\nThe darkness came in around it, touched it, hid it from sight.\n\n\n\nLee Garth twisted in his chair. Wearily he laid the pencil down.\nThe equations wouldn't work right. They kept trying to run off into\nimpossible combinations. There was an erratic but persistent gadfly of\nthought buzzing in his mind, a vague shadowy movement in his brain.\nLike a ghost from shadow-land it twisted through his brain, twisting\nthrough the dark convolutions where his memory lay testing the open\nsynapses, seeking a place where a short circuit would result in action.\n\nFretfully, Lee Garth picked up the pencil. But there was a thinking in\nhis mind, a formless thinking that was somehow purposeful. He sensed\nthe import of that purpose. Tiny chills ran over his body, tiny rivers\nof icy cold. His fingers trembled. The pencil moved over the page.\nGarth was first puzzled, then perturbed, then lost in a vast unease.\n\n\n\nHere and there upon this earth are fields where men, looking backward,\nsee how the stream of history shifted.\n\nThere is a field in Greece.\n\n\n\nXerxes gave his orders to his captains. He waited while his host was\nled forth. Footmen, archers, men with slings. The cavalry would not\nbe of value, for the barbarians, up there, were in a narrow mountain\npass. It did not matter. The light-armed troops were more than capable\nof dispelling these wild tribesmen. By noon, or the middle of the\nafternoon, the way would be clear to the peninsula beyond. Thus\nreasoned Xerxes.\n\nWhen the night came the barbarians were still holding. Tomorrow, Xerxes\nthought, his troops would be victorious.\n\nTomorrow came and fresh troops went forth. And eventually the news\ncame back to where Xerxes waited that his army had been routed and was\nfleeing in disorder.\n\nIt was fate, Xerxes perhaps decided. Fate was a chancy thing. No man\ncould know for certain what the morrow would bring. Tomorrow was a dark\nreality and the paths to the future were uncertain and tortuous.\n\nBut if Xerxes had ravaged the peninsula of Greece in 480 B.C. in all\nprobability Plato would not have been born in 427, and he would not\nhave had as his pupil a youth named Aristotle, and the thinking of\nthe scientists of twenty-five coming centuries would have lacked the\nguidance of these two men. Into the dark reality of the future the\nhuman race would have followed other paths and the man-world of 1940\nwould not have come into being.\n\nThere is a pass in Greece called Thermopylae.\n\n\n\nLee Garth watched, his eyes following the pencil. Cold winds seemed\nto blow on him. They blew colder each time he realized he was not\ndictating what the pencil was writing. He watched the factors appear\non the paper. There was a meaning in those symbols, a meaning and a\npurpose stretching across the long, long gulfs of time, reaching from\nthe amoeba, in the protoplasmic slime of steaming seas that are long\ngone, forward to the creature that shall emerge in some other era, in\nsome century of the far future.\n\nThrough him the meaning ran, through Lee Garth, who was 37 years old in\n1940.\n\n\n\nThere is a field in France.\n\nThe far-flung southern horn of the Saracen crescent, sweeping northward\nin its history changing flight, found the field in France where Charles\nMartel--Charles the Hammer--waited. With keen sword, and long lance,\nand hissing arrow, all day long the armies battled, and when the night\ncame on, the Saracen host, smashed and bleeding under the blows of the\nHammer, reeled backward, fled back out of France. To the Saracens,\ntomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, was the backward turning road. The\nglowing sun of Islam flickered, and never again burned so brightly.\nThere was a shift in history, and another world evolved because of\nCharles Martel.\n\nThere is a field in France called Tours.\n\nLee Garth mopped the perspiration from his forehead. He stopped writing\nfor a moment, pushed back his thinning hair, pulled a cigarette from\nthe package on his desk, struck a match. The smoke was blue and\nindistinct in that shadowed room. Far off, from another world it\nseemed, there came the raucous hoot of an automobile horn. Somebody\ngoing home, or going to work, or going somewhere but probably going\nhome, since the hour was so late. Didn't matter.\n\nThere was a gadfly buzzing in his brain.\n\nAgain the pencil raced over the paper.\n\n\n\nJan Lippershey's children played in his yard, and now and again, when\nhe would let them, they played in the shop where he worked. They liked\nto play with the things he made. Lenses, convex and concave. The\nchildren played with the lenses, and the telescope was born. Now men\ncould see farther.\n\nThat happened in Holland, early in the 1600s.\n\nPerhaps it was more important than Thermopylae or Tours.\n\nMen looked at the stars. World on world on world--world without end--as\nfar as the first telescope showed, the dance of the suns went on. Men\nmade bigger lenses. Beyond those limits the suns were to be found. Did\nspace go on forever? Bigger lenses, bigger lenses.\n\nBut still men could not see into tomorrow. It was a formless void of\nunreality and no instrument could penetrate it. Men had to go blindly\ninto tomorrow, fearing, hesitating, drawing back, until they were\nkicked there by relentless time.\n\nIn 1940 men worked on a lens 200 inches in diameter.\n\n\n\nIn 1940, all through a sleepless night, Lee Garth watched his racing\npencil write factor after factor, watched the equations grow from page\nto page. Still the pencil raced. He watched it.\n\nHe did not think of Leonidas, who had withstood Xerxes, or of Charles\nMartel, or of Jan Lippershey, or any of the thousands of others\nwho have warped the course of human destiny--Kepler, Newton, Watt,\nEinstein, Galileo, Copernicus, the little corporal who went down to\nSaint Helena. He did not even think of Lee Garth. For that night Lee\nGarth did not matter to himself. Nor ever again.\n\nThe dawn came in through the windows of the old house where he worked.\nSoftly, quietly, silently, the night went and the day came. Another\ntomorrow became today, another dark reality lifted out of the formless\nvoid of the future.\n\n\n\nGeorge McNeil, Scot production foreman in charge of the cable\nmanufacturing department on United Electric's vast plant, stared at the\norder that had come down to him. His face a wrinkled frown, he studied\nthe blue prints.\n\n\"Those domned monkeys with their domned slip-sticks,\" he grunted,\nreferring to the drafting department, \"have made another mistake.\"\n\nSpecification sheets in hands, he stalked out of his cubby-hole and\nheaded for the office of the production manager.\n\nThe production manager examined the specifications. He called the head\nof the drafting department on the office phone and got a short answer\nfor his trouble.\n\n\"The specifications are right,\" he said testily to McNeil. \"Go ahead\nand fabricate them.\"\n\n\"I can build the domned things,\" McNeil retorted. \"But I'll sweat in\nhell if I see any use for them. Solid copper bus-bars twenty-four\ninches in diameter! We don't build a generator--and neither does\nanybody else in the world--that needs such cables to carry the current\nit produces.\"\n\n\"They're just part of a big order that came down from the front office\nmarked 'Rush',\" the production manager answered. \"But they do seem out\nof reason--\" His forehead wrinkled into a frown. He hesitated. \"But\nan order is an order. Build them. What the customer wants with them is\nhis business.\"\n\nWhen McNeil left the office the production manager was still frowning.\nTwenty-four inch cables--. He scratched his head, as if to stir to life\na sluggish idea. Then he got up, walked through the plant, up to the\ngeneral offices, and the girl in the beautifully finished reception\nroom said Mr. Tompkins would see him in a minute.\n\n\"The point I make is this,\" the production manager said to Mr.\nTompkins, \"if anybody is building a generator that requires cables of\nthat size, we had better know about that generator.\"\n\nTompkins didn't show any emotion. He was a heavy man, not from fat but\nfrom muscle. Strength. He had to have strength to hold down his job as\ngeneral manager. His eyes narrowed slightly and a tiny glow appeared in\nthem.\n\n\"A fellow by the name of Garth placed that order,\" Tompkins said.\n\"Garth? Garth? Where have I heard that name before? Umph!\" He\nremembered the presence of his subordinate. \"Thank you. You may go.\"\n\nThe production manager went.\n\nTompkins flicked a switch on his desk. \"Call Railton.\"\n\nHe went on thinking. His eyes narrowed to slits and the glow deepened.\n\nRailton came. \"You called me?\" he asked. He was a slickie, a front man.\nCollege, teck school. Knew all about electricity, and what made the\nwheels go round. Knew how to talk it. Well dressed, smart.\n\n\"Go call on Lee Garth,\" Tompkins said. \"You will find his address\nin the files. Ask him if he will accept a ten day extension on the\ndelivery date of certain items of his order. That is your excuse for\ngetting in to see him.\"\n\n\"Lee Garth? He's a big shot theoretical physicist,\" Railton said.\n\"Worth a mint. Made his money on a bunch of inventions. The papers\ncall him another Einstein, but I personally think they over-rate him.\nWhat has he been ordering from us and what am I to find out?\"\n\n\"Find out why he needs solid copper bus-bars twenty-four inches in\ndiameter, but don't let him find out that's what you want to know.\"\n\n\"What?\" Railton recovered his composure. \"Yes sir.\"\n\n\"Get going.\"\n\nRailton left. When the chief used that tone, he wanted results, and to\nhell with expense and everything else that stood in the road of what\nwas wanted.\n\n\n\nDawn or dusk? And which roads lead to the future? Or is there no\nfuture? Is there only the present and the past, and is the present only\nthe husk of dying life?\n\nAgain and yet again and yet again the ancient yellow sun went down the\nsky, and night, ever growing bolder, came each evening out of the east.\nAgain and yet again the darkness crept around the huge ball that rested\non the nearer hill.\n\nThe ball did not lift again, did not move, did not stir or struggle.\nLike a huge stratosphere balloon made out of some strange metal, it\nrested there, unmoving.\n\nAnimals ranged through the night. In the darkness lonely dogs howled\nfor lost masters. There was never an answer to the howling of the dogs.\n\n\n\nScoop Martin's index fingers moved so rapidly they almost blurred. He\nonly used two fingers on the keyboard. Two were all he needed. The\ntypewriter carriage almost ran over itself getting across the paper. It\nstopped abruptly and Martin read his lead.\n\n\"Secrecy shrouds new scientific development at Valley Park, where Lee\nGarth, the world's outstanding physicist, has a large crew at work on\nthe construction of a large steel and concrete--\"\n\nMartin swore at himself, ripped the paper out of the typewriter. What a\nhell of a lead for a story. It didn't tell anything. Vague, ambiguous.\n\nBut where in the hell could he start this story?\n\nHe remembered that steam shovel, ripping the earth down to bed rock.\nGangs of men, drilling into the rock and driving reinforcing steel into\nit. Other gangs setting up forms for the concrete that was to come.\nA concrete tower going up, a huge mixer being blocked into position,\nlines of trucks dumping gravel and cement.\n\nFloodlights overhead so when night came the work could go on.\nTwenty-four hour a day schedule. Over the whole job the sense of\ndesperate urgency.\n\nMartin tried to think what that urgency might be. That would be his\nlead. A darned good one too. But he couldn't figure it out. All he\ncould say was that out at Valley Park men were tumbling over each other\ngetting done a job of work. They didn't walk. They ran. If a worker\ngave out, he stepped back out of place, and a fresh man took over his\njob while he rested.\n\nIt was costing a fortune. That didn't matter much. Lee Garth had a\nfortune. He was spending it.\n\nMartin thought of Lee Garth. In getting in he had practically forced\nhimself past an overworked secretary. Once in, he had found Garth in\nfront of a desk covered with papers.\n\nGarth was not a big man, not an impressive-looking man. You had to\nthink twice to realize the reputation he had won for himself. Pale blue\neyes and thin black hair. He looked like a dreamer, or a poet. Not very\nefficient. Or so he looked.\n\n\"Mr. Garth, I'm Martin of the _Globe_. We would like to have a story\nabout you and about the construction work going on out here. What are\nyou building? A new observatory, a laboratory, a workshop, or what?\"\n\nScoop had smiled in his most winning manner. He had a nose for news and\na way of getting it.\n\nGarth blinked at him. He seemed to withdraw his mind from a vast\ndistance to meet the problem presented by the newspaper man. He\nhesitated.\n\nWhen he spoke, he gave a hint of the man he was. \"Sorry, but I am not\ninterested in publicity.\"\n\n\"Not interested in publicity!\" Martin found that hard to believe, even\nfrom Lee Garth.\n\n\"But why all this construction work? What are you building?\"\n\n\"There is a need for it. I am not quite certain I know everything about\nthat need, that I really know anything about it, except that it exists.\"\n\n\"What is this need?\" Martin insisted. \"You've got twice as many men as\nyou can really use. You're working your crews twenty-four hours a day.\nWhat is it you need? What are you doing?\"\n\nFretfully, Garth answered. \"I can't tell you about it. It wouldn't make\nsense because it doesn't exist now. It exists two million years from\nnow.\"\n\nTwo millions years! What the hell? Garth was cracked, he was bugs, he\nwas off his nut.\n\nGarth punched a button. To that plain secretary he said, \"Stella, show\nMr. Martin out. And see that no one else without business here gets in.\nHire guards.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Garth.\"\n\nThere had been a sleek, prosperous-looking chap waiting in the outer\noffice when Martin went out. He had heard the secretary say, \"Mr. Garth\nwill see you now, Mr. Railton.\"\n\n\n\nTwo million years. Scoop Martin twisted at his desk, ran another sheet\nof paper into his typewriter. Two million years. Why, recorded history\ndidn't run back over five thousand years. That guy Garth was nuts. Or\nwas he? Those scientists talked damned funny at times. What would the\nearth look like in two million years? A baked, waterless plain, broken\nby jagged mountains? Dead, deserted, lifeless? Man and all of man's\nachievements gone?\n\nThis was 1940. If you added two million to that, what would the number\nbe? It would be darned hard to remember that it was 2,001,940.\n\nTwo million years. It was a gag, it had to be a gag. Two million years\ndidn't mean anything, didn't make sense. Yea, it was a gag. Well, he'd\njust make it a good one. There was his lead. He'd fix Garth for tossing\nhim out on his ear.\n\nHis index fingers raced over the keyboard, his thin face writhed into a\nwolfish grin.\n\n\"Prominent Scientist forecast doom of earth in two million years--\"\nScoop let his imagination go. It would be a good yarn at that. Might\neven make the front pages. No, not likely. Hitler was holding down the\nfront pages.\n\n\n\nRailton came through the front office at a dead run.\n\nMr. Tompkins swallowed his annoyance at the sight of the young man\nleaning against his desk. Mr. Railton was no longer sleek and capable.\nHe was panting and sweating, actually sweating.\n\n\"Chief,\" he panted, holding his side and gasping for air. \"That guy\nGarth, he's got--he's got _atomic power_.\"\n\nIt was the first time Railton or anyone else had ever seen Tompkins\nshow surprise.\n\n\"What?\" he snapped.\n\n\"Atomic power,\" Railton parroted. \"That's why he needed those bus-bars!\"\n\nTompkins settled back into his chair. His face turned faintly purple.\nHis eyes bored into the disheveled Railton.\n\n\"You got a lot of guts,\" he rasped, \"coming back to me with a cock and\nbull story like that.\"\n\nRailton whitened. Doggedly, he persisted in his story. \"I'm telling you\njust what he told me.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Tompkins said heavily. \"Tell me what happened.\"\n\n\"I went out to see him, and just as you suggested, I asked him if he\nwould accept a ten day extension on the delivery date of part of his\norder. Chief, as sure as we don't make delivery as per contract, that\nfellow will sue us for the last dollar in the treasury. He says he has\nto have delivery on August 21, without fail. He means it. What the hell\nhe is working on, I don't know, but that man is in a hurry and he means\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"We will make delivery as scheduled unless it is to our interest to do\notherwise,\" Tompkins interrupted. \"Get to the point.\"\n\n\"In order to pacify him, I told him we would guarantee delivery. Then I\nwent over his whole order with him, to make certain that everything was\nright. When we got to those bus-bars, I suggested there must have been\nsome mistake.\"\n\n\"He said, 'No. No mistake. The specifications are right.'\"\n\n\"I protested that there wasn't a generator made that needed bars of\nthat size to carry its load.\"\n\n\"He said, 'No, but there is going to be one. Those cables aren't any\ntoo heavy to carry the power of the bursting atom.' Those are his exact\nwords. 'The power of the bursting atom.'\"\n\nTompkins leaned back in his chair. Viciously he bit the end off of a\ncigar.\n\n\"Then Garth is crazy, instead of you!\" he said.\n\nRailton's face turned white. \"Well--\" He made futile noises deep in his\nthroat. \"Well, you may be right. Because, well--if Garth has discovered\natomic power--it--it doesn't mean much to him. He isn't interested in\nit. He isn't working on it. He's working on something else, something\nbigger, and atomic power is just one of the little things he needs to\nreach the goal he wants....\"\n\nRailton's voice trailed off. He was a slickie, a smoothie. He knew all\nabout electricity, and the power industry. He knew all about uranium\n235, and why it wouldn't work. He knew what atomic power would do to\nthe power industry. He was wondering if Garth _was_ crazy. Or what was\nGarth trying to do? What purpose was so vast that atomic power was\nonly incidental to it?\n\nThere was silence in the room. The clamor of traffic outside did not\npenetrate here. The only sound was the soft whisper of a fan pushing\ncool air through the conditioning apparatus.\n\nTompkins cleared his throat. \"Thank you. You may go.\"\n\n\"You mean--that's all?\"\n\n\"That's all.\"\n\n\"But what do you think?\"\n\nTompkins stirred restlessly. \"I don't know what to think.\"\n\nRailton left.\n\nTompkins sat without moving. Garth, Lee Garth. Atomic power. He didn't\ndare take a chance. Too much was at stake. He had to know. He picked up\nthe phone. His secretary got the connection for him.\n\n\"Sullivan? This is Tompkins. There's a fellow out at Valley Park by\nthe name of Lee Garth. I don't know but I suspect that somewhere in\nhis house you would find blueprints, if you look. If I were you, I\nwould have one of your boys do a little looking. Yes, the financial\narrangements will be taken care of to your satisfaction.\"\n\nTompkins hung up the phone. He turned his mind to other matter.\n\nSullivan ran a detective agency. If you didn't like your wife, he would\nmake it easy for you to get a divorce. If your employees were demanding\na higher wage rate, he could handle that too. Divorces, strikes,\nanything.\n\n\n\nDawn world or dusk world?\n\nOverhead the sun slanted westward, and the night, black and ominous,\ncame out of the east. The birds sang their songs as the day closed, and\nthe animals that moved in the night awakened, and ranged abroad. And on\nthe hills there was the sound of mournful howling, like the baying of\nlost and lonely dogs seeking their masters; but not finding them, not\never.\n\n\n\nScoop Martin twisted in his sleep. Or was he asleep? It was hard to\nknow, when you were sleeping. You might be awake. Or you might be\ndreaming. But how would you know for certain?\n\nHe sat up in bed, stared at the window. The moon was shining through\nthe window, casting a thin, ambiguous light into the room.\n\n\"Two million years,\" he whispered.\n\nHell, yes, he was asleep, he was having a nightmare. He laid down and\nrolled over. Suddenly he was wide awake.\n\n\n\nThe house was dark, Mike Ritter saw. Good. The boss wanted some\nblueprints, or plans, out of that house. Fifty bucks for them. They\nmust be important if the boss was willing to pay that much for them.\nWell, his job was to get them.\n\nHe slipped through the darkness toward the house. Over to the right,\nat a distance of about three hundred yards, there was a lot of lights.\nHe stopped to stare. A building of some kind was going up. Trucks were\ncoming up a lane, dumping gravel and cement. Under the lights men were\npouring concrete until hell wouldn't have it.\n\n\"What's the hurry?\" Mike wondered.\n\nWell, it wasn't his affair. His job was to get into that house. He\nturned. The beam from a flashlight struck him in the face.\n\n\"Buddy,\" a voice growled at him. \"You better get out of here a damned\nsight faster than you got in.\"\n\nMike blinked. The boss hadn't said anything about guards. What the\nhell....\n\n\"Get going. And don't come back. Or is it a poke in the snoot you'll be\nwanting now?\"\n\nMike got going. This would require some careful planning.\n\n\n\nTompkins picked up the morning _Globe_. The war was still going on.\nRaids on Britain. The blitz was coming. He read the accounts through.\n\nWhat was this?\n\n\"Prominent scientist forecasts doom of earth in two million years. Lee\nGarth....\"\n\nHe read the article through. He thought heavily for a few moments. Then\nhe spoke into the box on his desk.\n\n\"Get me Sullivan on the phone.\"\n\n\n\nThe bell of an invisible alarm clock was ringing in Lee Garth's mind.\nHe turned over, tried to go back to sleep. Sleep was such a wonderful\nsensation, especially when you were so tired. He wanted to sleep\nforever, and forever. There wasn't enough time left for him to get\nrested. Days and yet more days the driving pressure of screaming energy\nhad run through him. It had burned out his muscles, put a flutter in\nhis heart. His whole body screamed for rest. He had to rest. He tried\nto go back to sleep.\n\nThe invisible alarm clock rang again.\n\nAbruptly, Garth rolled over and sat up. Yawning, he flexed his arms.\nEvery nerve ending in his body told him to lie down again, called to\nhim to lie down, begged him. He was going to lie down.\n\nThe alarm bell in his mind rang again.\n\nWhat did it mean, he wondered.\n\nOh, yes, now he knew. It was August 21.\n\nToday United Electric began making deliveries. The construction work\nwas already finished, the concrete dry, the forms already off.\n\nSuddenly he was wide awake. Suddenly he was out of bed, and dressing\nfrantically.\n\n\n\nJimmie Blake excused himself from dinner. His dad and mother smiled\nwistfully as he dashed upstairs.\n\nJimmie whistled as he shaved. Shaving was really not necessary, but\nhe imagined it was, and in consequence it was a ritual not to be\nneglected. For he was a man now. Next week he was going off to college\nagain. He would be a sophomore this year. No more green caps, no more\nhazing. The whistle swelled in prideful strength.\n\nHe looked out of the bathroom window. The sun, already at the edge\nof the horizon, flung its rays over the suburb of Valley Park. The\ngrass was dry and the leaves were beginning to change color. It was\nSeptember, September 8, 1940. Jimmie burst into song. One more week and\nhe would be off to college.\n\nOver there, perhaps half a mile away, he could see the sunlight shining\non fresh concrete. Garth's Folly, they were calling it already. Garth\nhad spent a fortune building a house that would stand to the end of the\nworld. Two million years, that newspaper article had said.\n\nToo bad. Garth had gone off the deep end, of course. Just when he was\nreally becoming distinguished, he had cracked. Why didn't they have him\nin an asylum, Jimmie wondered, staring from the window.\n\nOddly, the landscape shifted. It blurred and twisted, just like it did\nwhen you looked through a pane of bad glass. But he wasn't looking\nthrough glass.\n\nThe air was tinged with a deep violet color. From somewhere, from\nnowhere and from everywhere, came a shrill whining note, a screaming\nfrequency that lifted rapidly up the scale. It went quickly out of\nhearing.\n\nThe violet deepened to black and the light was gone. Suddenly knives\nwere tearing at his flesh. His body was racked by a thousand pains.\n\nJimmie Blake screamed. The scream was choked off into horrible silence.\n\nHis father came to the foot of the stairs.\n\n\"What's wrong, son?\" he called.\n\nThere was no answer.\n\nHis father went upstairs. Mystified, perplexed, he began to search.\n\n\"Jimmie!\" he called. \"_Jimmie!_\"\n\nThere was no answer.\n\nJimmie's mother came up the stairs. Her face was suddenly white. One\nhand was pressed over her heart.\n\n\"What--\" she began.\n\nHer husband was standing in their son's room. She had not known he was\nso old, so haggard, and so tired looking.\n\n\"Jimmie's gone,\" he whispered.\n\nHe barely managed to catch her as she fell.\n\n\n\nLee Garth's face was white, drawn, pinched. Bloodless. His hair was\ntwisted and tangled, there was a stubble on his face.\n\nHe lifted blood-clotted eyes from the screen in front of him, the\nscreen that had suddenly gone blank as he flipped a dial set in the\ncontrol-studded table on which his hands rested.\n\nDeep in the heart of the tower of steel and concrete a lion-roar went\ninto silence.\n\n\"God,\" Garth whispered. \"Dear God.\"\n\nHis voice was cracked and chipped and lined with pain.\n\nHis head slumped forward, rested on the table.\n\nBehind him there was a tiny creak as a door opened. He lifted his head\nto stare dully at the person who stood there.\n\n\"Stella? I thought I told you I didn't need a secretary any longer, to\nwrite yourself a check and go away?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Garth.\"\n\nShe came forward holding a tray.\n\n\"But I think you need me now more than ever. And so I stayed. I will\nleave if you order it.\"\n\nHe stared at her. She wasn't pretty, or he had never thought she was.\nBut on her face at this moment was something that made her beautiful.\nHer eyes were filled with a deep glowing.\n\nHe remembered the years she had been his secretary, the years of hard\nwork perfectly performed. If they worked until midnight, she had never\ncomplained. Summer, winter, spring, and autumn. Why she had never had a\nvacation! But then Lee Garth had never had a vacation. He didn't know\nwhat the word meant.\n\nHe stared at her, at the radiant glowing that was transforming her.\n\n\"But--but you must not stay here. You _must not_. Don't you understand?\nThis is the end.\"\n\nShe set the tray in front of him.\n\n\"You must eat something. You haven't had a good meal in weeks. Here is\na sandwich and a glass of milk.\"\n\nHe was vaguely aware of a gnawing in his stomach, a persistent ache.\n\n\"Why--thanks--Yes, I am hungry!\" He looked at the tray.\n\nThe door creaked as she left the room.\n\nHe wolfed the food. He turned again to the table in front of him. He\npressed buttons.\n\nUnder him, in the belly of the squat tower of concrete and steel, a\nlion began to roar. The roar increased until the whole structure was\nshaking with the pressure of inconceivable energies seeking release. It\nbecame a whirling, roaring, thundering torrent of sound, a screaming\npulse of incalculable force.\n\n\n\nMadeline Brown went out into the garden. Her mother watched her go. Not\nmuch longer, her mother thought, would she have a daughter. The girl\nwas blooming into womanhood. Within a year or two some young fellow\nwould claim her. The boys were already becoming a bother with their\nphone calls. Madeline Brown's mother wondered how it would feel to be a\ngrandmother. Lord, she was getting old.\n\nAs from a great distance, she heard her daughter call. She rushed into\nthe garden, recognizing the panic in that call.\n\nMadeline was gone. There wasn't a sign of her anywhere. There was only\nthe night coming down.\n\nThe mother's scream ripped through the gathering darkness.\n\n\"Madeline!\"\n\nThere was no answer.\n\n\n\nA winding river ran through Valley Park, and beside the winding river,\nin the star-sprinkled September night, John Bruce walked with Jennie\nWest. The browning leaves were beginning to fall. Soon it would be\nautumn, soon it would be October, and after October, there would not\nbe any Jennie West. There would be Mrs. John Bruce. John hoped that a\nclerk's salary would support her, but if it wouldn't, he'd darned well\nget another job.\n\nThey stopped beside the river wherein the stars up in the sky were\nreflected, and it was in his mind to kiss her, but she was in a\nmood for teasing and she slipped away from him into the soft night.\nLaughing, he started after her.\n\nSuddenly she screamed in fright.\n\n\"Jennie! What is it? Where are you?\" John Bruce shouted.\n\nShe didn't answer. He started running in the direction from which her\nscream had come.\n\nHe couldn't find her.\n\n\"Jennie!\"\n\nThe stars shifted, the trees bent, the earth twisted, heaved, and\nrolled. His body was cut with a million knives. There was a whistle in\nthe air.\n\nThen there was silence.\n\n\n\nScoop Martin almost jumped out of bed. He could have sworn the\ntelephone was ringing. But it wasn't. Or was it?\n\nJust another of those nightmares, he decided. He hadn't been sleeping\nwell for over a month. It was hell not to be able to sleep.\n\nHe laid down again.\n\nThe telephone lifted him out of bed like a jumping-jack coming out of\nits box.\n\n\"Who is it? Oh, I'm sorry, chief, I didn't know it was you. What do you\nwant? Working for you, hasn't a man got any rights at all?--Huh?--I'm\nsorry. Huh!--_Thirty-eight people gone, just like they had walked off\nthe face of the earth?_ And more reports coming in all the time? All\nright, all right; I'm on my way to Valley Park right now.\"\n\n\n\nOutside the police station, the street was jammed by a silent crowd, a\ntense, straining, shifting mass of people. Scoop fought his way through\nthem.\n\nInside, the station was alive with reporters, A.P. men, specials, U.P.\nmen, a leg man from every sheet in the city. They were all asking\nquestions. A brawny man, with his uniform coat flung open, was trying\nto answer them. The phone kept interrupting him. Every time it rang,\nthe room dived into silence.\n\n\"Madam, I'm sorry. Yes--yes--We'll send a detail right away. You look\naround the neighborhood yourself. Perhaps she has just gone to the drug\nstore. Yes.... I'm sorry, but I don't know what to tell you. We'll do\nthe best we can.\"\n\n\"Another one?\" a reporter queried as the phone went back on the hook.\nThe chief of police nodded.\n\nThe strained silence was broken by the harsh breathing of frightened\nmen.\n\n\"Lord!\" a reporter whispered. \"That's seventy-three now. And nobody\nknows how many may have vanished without being reported!\"\n\nThe phone rang again. The chief of police grabbed it.\n\n\"Hello ... Oh ... Governor. You're right we want the guard. We want\nthem as fast as we can get them.\"\n\n\n\nMartin found a reporter he knew, plugged questions at him.\n\n\"They just go out of sight, that's all,\" the reporter told him. \"How\nit happens, why it happens, nobody knows, least of all the police.\nWhen the first two reports came in, they thought it was a couple of\nsnatches, but they've been scared out of that idea now. There's no rime\nor reason to it. Youngsters, nineteen, twenty years old; boys, girls,\ncouples. Somebody hears them scream, but by the time anybody gets\nthere, they're gone. God knows where they've gone or what has happened\nto them. Jack Lecroy, heir to the biggest fortune in this town, is\ngone. Two Polish factory workers, brothers, were in their room. Their\nold man went in to ask them something. They weren't there. College\ngirls, shirt factory girls. It doesn't discriminate. Talk about the\nPied Piper!--What's that?\"\n\nOutside the building a voice had begun to screech.\n\n\"It's the end of the world. The angel Gabriel is blowing his horn and\nthe goats are being separated from the sheep. I'm ready, Lord, I'm\nready. Come and take me--\"\n\nThe reporter's face went a shade whiter. \"That's another one gone off\nhis nut. But he may be right, for all I know. Where you going?\"\n\nScoop Martin was shoving his way toward the desk of the chief of\npolice. In his mind a phrase had clicked.\n\n\"Chief, I'm Martin, of the _Globe_. Listen to me.... I know you don't\nwant to answer any more questions, but I've got an idea. About a\nmonth ago I interviewed a scientist living here in Valley Park, Lee\nGarth. Did you read the story I wrote? He prophesied the end of the\nworld. Then he got busy and built himself a castle that a regiment of\nartillery couldn't blast down.... Listen, maybe he knows more about\nthis than he told.\"\n\nThe harassed officer stared at Martin, then grabbed his phone.\nEventually he laid the receiver back on its hook.\n\n\"Garth doesn't answer,\" he said.\n\nHe bit off the end of a cigar. \"I'll send a squad.\"\n\nTwo brawny young cops forced their way through the massed throng. The\ncrowd caught the news that they were headed out to Garth's Folly.\n\nThey didn't come back.\n\nAnother squad, with orders to make a careful investigation, reported\nthat the car of the first squad had run into a tree beside the drive\ninside the grounds of Garth's place, that the two men were missing,\nand that Garth was not in his house but was probably inside his\nconcrete tower.\n\n\"Maybe,\" Scoop whispered, as the report came through. \"Maybe Garth is\ndoing this. Or maybe--he talked about the end of the world two million\nyears from now--maybe he was lying. Maybe the end of the world is\ncoming right now. Maybe Garth can help us.\"\n\n\"If there is a chance that Garth is either responsible or can help us,\"\nthe chief of police shouted. \"By God, I'll get him out of that place if\nI have to blast.\"\n\nThe phone rang again. He grabbed it, listened. \"We'll do all we can,\"\nhe said.\n\nHe hung up, looked at his own men, at the reporters. \"Another one gone.\"\n\nHis fist came down on the desk.\n\n\"I'm going to see Lee Garth. Come on, men.\"\n\nHe led the way. Scoop piled into the car. Those who couldn't get into\nthe car, hung on the sides.\n\nThey came in sight of the tower of concrete. It was a squat fortress in\nthe starlight. There wasn't a light in it.\n\n\"There it is, men,\" the chief of police said. \"Drive up to it. We'll\nfind out if Garth knows anything about this.\"\n\nSuddenly, to the occupants of the car, the tower seemed to lean toward\nthem. The trees seemed to shiver in a blast of passing air.\n\nBut there was no wind. The air was very quiet.\n\nHow could trees dance in a wind when there was no wind?\n\nThe ground seemed to writhe. It seemed to twitch.\n\nMen screamed.\n\nThe car left the drive, plunged forward into a tree. The motor\nsputtered, coughed indignantly, died. Then the night was silent, except\nfor the deep, bull-throated roar pounding from the tower which Lee\nGarth had constructed.\n\nThere wasn't a man in the car.\n\nScoop Martin never wrote his story that night. Nor any night thereafter.\n\n\n\nGarth had slumped forward, his head on his arms. He awakened to the\ntouch on his shoulder, turned tired eyes up to the girl who had entered.\n\n\"You?\" his voice was dull and low. \"You still here?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Garth. Here, I have some breakfast for you.\" Her face was\npinched and drawn and only her eyes were beautiful.\n\nHe gulped at the food. While he ate, she went to a small opening and\nlooked out. She returned to him, and when he had finished eating, she\nspoke.\n\n\"The militia, or perhaps they are national guardsmen, are here. They\nhave surrounded us.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nFor a moment, he did not understand. \"Oh. So soon? No! You must be\nmistaken.\"\n\nHe went quickly to the opening, stared through it. Minutes passed. To\nthe woman who watched him, he seemed to grow older with each passing\nmoment.\n\nHe turned. She was still there. He faced her.\n\n\"You--you haven't asked why the militia are here?\" It was a question\nand not a statement.\n\n\"No sir.\"\n\nHer answer left him momentarily at a loss for words.\n\n\"You don't know--what happened last night?\"\n\n\"No. I do not need to know. I doubt if I could understand. It would\nmake no difference.\" She spoke quickly, the words blurring into each\nother.\n\nThere was suddenly hunger in Lee Garth's eyes, the hunger that grows in\nlonely men.\n\n\"Stella--\"\n\nThe flat smash of an explosion coming from outside jerked him back\nto the opening. A deep, angry drone sliced through the morning air.\nAnother explosion slapped the earth.\n\n\"Bombers! A squadron of planes! The fools! What are they saying about\nme out there, I wonder? No matter. I did what I had to do. Or tried.\nThere is only one thing left to do.\"\n\nThere was no anger in his voice. There was only resignation.\n\n\"Stella,\" he said, \"if you ran from the door, I think they would let\nyou escape. They want me instead of you. You could say I had held you\nprisoner.\"\n\nHer voice was level.\n\n\"But what about you?\"\n\n\"I will stay,\" Lee Garth answered.\n\n\"Here?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"I really didn't mean I will stay here,\" he amended. \"I will go there.\nI am needed, I think.\"\n\nShe did not understand. No one else would have understood. But she\nhad no need for understanding. She knew the secret that surpasses\nunderstanding.\n\nShe shook her head. \"If you stay, I stay.\"\n\nHis eyes met hers.\n\n\"There are numerous things,\" he whispered, \"that I would like to do\nover, if I had the chance. You understand?\"\n\nThe smile that lifted out of her eyes was the most beautiful thing he\nhad ever seen. He choked. There was an obstruction in his throat.\n\n\"Stella--\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Garth.\"\n\nSmash!\n\nThe morning rocked with the explosion of another bomb.\n\n\"Quickly!\" he gasped. \"Stand here beside me. This tower won't stand a\ndirect hit. There isn't a second to lose.\"\n\nShe moved to his side.\n\nHe put his arm around her. His free hand moved among the controls on\nthe table.\n\nBelow them, in the heart of the tower of concrete and steel, a\nbull-throated roar started building up, started howling as energies\nbeyond computation were set in motion.\n\n\"Don't be afraid,\" he whispered. \"I think it won't hurt very long.\"\n\nShe was still smiling.\n\n\n\nGoggling, Tompkins read the description.\n\n\"Perhaps as the result of a direct bomb hit, but more likely as the\nresult of the release by Garth himself of some super-powerful explosive\nthat burned but did not explode, the tower vanished in flame. The\nconcrete glowed red, then appeared to run, then quivered for a moment\nlike jelly. There was a blast of furious heat which forced back the\nattackers. The tower puffed into dust.\n\n\"There is now no question but that Garth was responsible for the people\nwho vanished. They stopped disappearing when the tower dissolved. What\nGarth was attempting no one knows, but he escaped the stern justice\nthat would have been meted out to him by committing suicide.\"\n\n\"By the great Godfrey!\" Tompkins muttered. \"That fellow had discovered\natomic power. What he was using it for, I don't know. But he had it.\nNothing else could produce a result like that. He had it. And I let it\nget away! I called Sullivan off, because that story in the paper about\nGarth predicting the end of the earth made me think he was a cracked\nfool. But he had atomic power. And I could have had it, if I hadn't\ncalled Sullivan off. He had it. And I let it get away.\"\n\nBack and forth across the private office, he paced, muttering.\n\n\"He had it. He had atomic power. I could have had it. But I let it get\naway.\"\n\n\n\nFor an infinitesimal fraction of a second, as inconceivable energies\nwere somehow released, the low hills and the trees growing on the low\nhills seemed to writhe and twist as if the light rays were being bent\nby some refracting medium.\n\nThen the translating force collapsed.\n\nLee Garth fell. Not far, not over a few feet. His legs buckled under\nhim as he landed. He rolled. He stopped rolling. The ground was soft,\nand to his weary body it was a perfect haven for rest. Earth, soft\nearth, and rest. His senses reeled. As he lost consciousness, he felt\nsomeone tugging at him.\n\nFor a long time there was only the consciousness of complete\nrelaxation, rest, surcease from striving. Rest! How he needed it.\n\nBut a confused babble of voices kept intruding. And someone was rubbing\nhis head.\n\nAs he opened his eyes, he saw that his head was in a woman's lap. Who\nwas she? And why should she have his head in her lap? He had never had\nanything to do with women. Oh. Stella. Oh....\n\n\"Mr. Garth,\" Stella whispered. \"You had better stand up, if you can.\nThere is going to be--trouble.\"\n\nOh, yes, trouble. There had always been trouble, but somehow he had not\nthought to find it here. But he got to his feet slowly.\n\nHe found himself in the center of a circle of people. Men and women.\nSeveral of the men wore blue, police uniforms. The men in blue had\nguns. The others had clubs. Some had rocks. Even some of the girls had\nrocks.\n\n\"It's Garth,\" he heard a voice say.\n\n\"Yeah, it's Garth all right,\" another voice answered.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" Lee Garth said.\n\n\"Shut up!\" a voice answered.\n\n\"What have you done to us, Garth?\n\n\"Yeah, that's what we want to know: what have you done to us, Garth?\n\n\"Don't try to deny it! We know you did it.\n\n\"Where are we, Garth?\n\n\"You and your experiments!\"\n\nLee Garth ran his eyes around the circle. A small, wolfish-faced chap\ncaught his attention. He recognized the man. Martin. A newspaper man.\n\n\"Hello, Martin,\" Garth said.\n\n\"What the hell have you done to us, Garth?\" Martin said, scowling. He\nwas truculent. He was also scared. He had a rock in his hand.\n\n\"I--\" Garth began.\n\nA man with a club stepped forward. \"Whatever you've done, I want you to\nun-do it, see? You brought me here. You damned well better be ready to\ntake me back, see! And be fast about it.\"\n\n\"But that is impossible,\" Garth answered.\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"I can't take you back. I can't return you. You're here, and here you\nwill have to stay.\"\n\nAnger ran through the group like a hurricane through a forest.\n\n\"Damn you, Garth!\" a voice growled.\n\n\"What do you think we are--guinea pigs?\"\n\n\"You're going to take us home, or else!\"\n\n\"If you think you can move us into this damned country, where there\nain't a house in sight and no sign there ever was one, you've got\nanother think coming.\"\n\n\"Darn you, Garth.\"\n\nIn all the tumult Garth heard only one voice on his side, a girl's\nvoice.\n\n\"John Bruce,\" the girl said. \"You give Mr. Garth a chance to explain.\nHe didn't do this without a reason.\"\n\n\"Aw, Jennie,\" the tall youth beside her answered. \"You keep out of\nthis. Garth brought us here without asking us, and he's darned well\ngoing to take us back.\"\n\n\"But I can't,\" Lee Garth said firmly.\n\nSilence fell.\n\nIn the silence Stella whispered. \"Mr. Garth, we had better run, if we\ncan. They won't listen, they don't want to listen. They're scared, and\ndangerous.\"\n\nThe difference between a crowd and a mob is an angry voice expressing\nthe thoughts lurking in the minds of all.\n\n\"You can't return us, eh?\" the angry voice said. \"Well, we'll just fix\nyour clock. Come on, boys!\"\n\nLee Garth would have stayed, but Stella pushed him, got him started. He\nfought his way through the circle of men. Then the two were running.\n\nThe mob gave chase.\n\nThe crack of a pistol shuddered behind them. A slug tore into a tree\nnear Garth. The gun boomed again. Angry men screamed.\n\nRun, Garth thought. It wouldn't do much good, but the instinct was to\nrun, to preserve life as long as possible. Run! Through the trees, up\nthe hillside. Men were coming. Run. Was this the right turning? It was.\nUp the hill, up the nearer hill.\n\nOnly he couldn't run much farther. His heart was beginning to hurt.\nDidn't matter. Death came to everything eventually, to Xerxes, to\nLeonidas, to Charles Martel, to Copernicus, and Galileo. Death was\ncoming to him at the hands of those angry, frightened men, coming\nquickly, unless he found what he sought, what he knew was here,\nsomewhere.\n\nWhere was the thing he sought? He had to find it, quickly. He couldn't\nrun much farther.\n\nThey were at the top of the nearer hill.\n\nThen Garth saw what he was seeking.\n\nA huge sphere. A ball made out of some strange, silvery metal. It\nrested on top of the nearer hill.\n\nGarth and the girl staggered toward it.\n\nOut from it reached twin fingers of light. The streamers touched Garth,\nthey touched the girl.\n\n\"We're there,\" Garth sighed. \"We've found the place. We've won. We're\nsafe.\"\n\nYelping with the lust to kill, the men came through the woods, came up\nthe hill.\n\nFingers of light reached out from the sphere. A glowing streamer\ntouched another man. He dropped the rock he was carrying. Another man.\nHe laid down his club.\n\nSomething rode the streamers of light. A message. It whispered to the\nmen the light touched. Their cries ran into quick silence. They looked\nat each other, they looked at Garth and the girl with him. Both were\nleaning against the sphere. They seemed to be drawing strength from it.\nThey were smiling.\n\nAn awed whisper ran through the men who had so recently been a mob.\n\n\"What is that thing, that ball?\"\n\n\"Look at the light coming from it!\"\n\n\"Say, I think we were wrong about this fellow, Garth.\"\n\n\"When that light touched me, I changed my mind about him.\"\n\n\"Let's go see what this is all about.\"\n\n\"Come on. Nothing is going to hurt us. I feel it.\"\n\nSlowly, they approached. Anger had already left them. Now fear left\nthem. Only awe remained.\n\nThen a voice began to speak.\n\n\n\nHere and there upon this earth are fields where men, looking backward,\nsay, \"Here history was made. Because of what happened here, a new world\ncame into being.\"\n\nThere is a pass in Greece, a field in France, a backyard in Holland.\nThere are fields in America too.\n\nThere is a field two million years in the future!\n\n\n\nDawn world or dusk world?\n\nThe sun went down the western sky. Its rays were flung over the group\nclustered around the globe, over the listening men, who stared quickly\nat each other, then away, then stole a glance at Garth, leaning against\nthat globe. Over the frightened, clinging, awed girls, who listened too.\n\nIn the air was a voice. It came from the sphere. It went directly to\nthe minds of the listeners, whispered as a thought current in their\nbrains, whispered as a ghost moving among the nerve endings. The voice\nsaid:\n\n\"Thus the human race reached its goal. There were not many of us left,\na few hundred only. We had reached the point where mental activity\nalone interested us.... Then our last genius invented what we can only\ndescribe to you as a perfect brain. It was a substance that would\nabsorb and retain mental impulses. It would absorb and retain our\nmental impulses. In effect, then, it would become us.\n\n\"That substance is housed in the heart of this sphere.\n\n\"We built the sphere, set forces in it that made it, to the best of our\nknowledge, all powerful. We armed it with incredible weapons. We built\ninto it the apparatus to warp space--an adaptation of the drive we once\nused on our space ships. Then, on the brain substance housed in the\nheart of this sphere, we impressed the individual consciousness of each\nliving person, and the knowledge that each person had in his own mind,\nwhich included all the knowledge that the human race has gained in\nmore than two million years. We blended into one mind the minds of the\ntwo hundred humans who remained alive. Housed in a substance that was\neternal, sheltered in a sphere that could not be destroyed, it became\nan almost perfect mind. We thought it was perfect. We discarded our\nbodies, as outworn tools. Physically, the human race died. Mentally, it\nwould live forever.\n\n\"One thing we had never done--flown to the stars. We had reached the\nplanets and had almost forgotten them. But the stars in the sky we had\nnot reached. It was the last great voyage of discovery.\n\n\"We set out for the stars. And we reached them!\"\n\nThe twinkling points of light that Jan Lippershey had shown to be suns\nlost in the immensity of space!\n\nThe voice died into silence, seemed to rest, then whispered again.\n\n\"And near Antares a meteor swarm struck us. Inconceivable powers\nwere housed within this sphere. We tried to escape but the swarm\nwas moving almost as fast as light. We tried to blast the meteors\ninto nothingness, and we succeeded in this. But we could not succeed\nforever. Eventually even the powers of this sphere were near\nexhaustion. Thousands of pea-size meteors struck us. The force of those\ncollisions cracked the sphere itself. In time we limped back to earth,\nlimped back to a place where we could lie up and lick our wounds.\n\n\"We discovered that the wounds would not heal, that the damage was\nirreparable. Energy was leaking from the sphere, a little by a little.\nSomehow we had erred in its construction.\n\n\"Somehow we had gone down the wrong road, had taken the wrong turning.\n\n\"We could not anticipate that this would happen, we could not see what\nwould happen tomorrow. But we knew that our race, and your race, was\ndying here, that you, back in the mists of time, were moving down a\nroad with death as your destiny.\n\n\"The drive that carries a race is not lightly ended.\n\n\"But the human race ended in us, in our error.\n\n\"It was our mistake. It was our task to correct it, if we could.\n\n\"We tried.\n\n\"We could not go back through time, but we could force our thoughts\nback to certain cyclic periods. We could reach only a few periods, most\nof them too early or too late to meet our needs. Eventually we found a\ntime that was right and a mind that could understand. To that mind we\ngave instructions, to Lee Garth....\"\n\nThe voice paused, sought for energy, slowly gathered it, then went on.\n\n\"That is why you were brought here--to repopulate a world, to take up\nwhere we left off, to correct an error made two million years after\nyour time.\n\n\"We have taken the living from the remote past and used them to bridge\nthe chasm of death. Yours to carry on.\"\n\nThere was silence. Men moved awkwardly, staring at each other, at that\nsphere, at Lee Garth. The girls, somehow, seemed to understand.\n\nIt was Scoop Martin who came out of the crowd, stood apologetically\nbefore Lee Garth.\n\n\"Mr. Garth, sir, is that right, what we heard?\"\n\nScoop's wolfish face was a mask of fear, doubt, and hesitation.\n\nGarth swallowed. He nodded.\n\n\"But--\" the reporter gestured toward the globe. \"How can men be in\nthat?\"\n\nGarth answered slowly. \"A lot can be learned in two million years. It\nis not impossible. You, the you that really exists, your mind, your\nconsciousness, is a movement of thought within a suitable medium.\nEvolution provided a chemical medium, a mass of tissue, your brain.\nThat is all you really are, the movement of current within your brain\ncells.... The men who came two million years after us found a better\nmedium than the brain. Upon that better medium, they impressed their\nthinking.\"\n\nGarth hesitated, and when he spoke, it was not to Martin, but to\nsomeone else.\n\n\"Is that not right?\"\n\nThere was a rustle in the air. A voice whispered.\n\n\"In essence, that is correct. It was not so simple as that, but you\nhave the underlying thought. In the year that we have yet to live, we\nwill teach you the process. Perhaps you may discover our error. Perhaps\nyou will want to use other methods. We cannot advise on that point. The\nonly thing that matters is that the race must go on to whatever is its\nultimate destiny.\"\n\nSighing with the pulse of failing energy, the whisper ceased.\n\nThe group stirred again, moving restlessly.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Garth spoke, \"that I did not ask your permission to\nbring you here. But I had no choice. If I had asked for volunteers to\nrepopulate the world of two million years from our time, you would have\nconcluded I was crazy. So I had to bring you here without consulting\nyou.\"\n\nThey didn't seem to hear him. They stirred uneasily. All malice was\ngone out of them. Only unease and trembling wonder were left.\n\nMartin twisted. He spoke.\n\n\"We have to rebuild--to repopulate--a world. That's why we're here?\"\n\nGarth swallowed, fighting the lump in his throat. He nodded.\n\n\"It seems hard to understand, sir,\" Martin said. \"But what can I do to\nhelp?\"\n\nThe lump in Garth's throat rose so high he could not swallow it.\n\nA bulky figure in uniform came out of the crowd. \"What can I do, Mr.\nGarth, to help?\"\n\nThere was a confused babble of voice. \"What can we do, Mr. Garth, to\nhelp?\"\n\nIn that babble he heard only one voice, that of the girl at his side,\nasking what she might do.\n\n\"You might remember,\" he answered, \"that--that my name is Lee.\"\n\nAnd when, during the shadow night that followed, the descendents of\nthe dogs the race had left behind them howled on the hills for their\nlost masters, now there came an answer. Men whistled to them. Slowly,\nhesitantly, fearfully, but gaining confidence as the whistles of men\nroused half lost memories, the dogs came down from the hills to their\nnew masters.\n\nHere and there, upon this earth, are fields.",
