    "body": "\"See you in half an hour, Betty,\" said Ned Vince over the party\ntelephone. \"We'll be out at the Silver Basket before ten-thirty....\"\n\nNed Vince was eager for the company of the girl he loved. That was why\nhe was in a hurry to get to the neighboring town of Hurley, where she\nlived. His old car rattled and roared as he swung it recklessly around\nPit Bend.\n\nThere was where Death tapped him on the shoulder. Another car leaped\nsuddenly into view, its lights glaring blindingly past a high,\nup-jutting mass of Jurassic rock at the turn of the road.\n\nDazzled, and befuddled by his own rash speed, Ned Vince had only swift\nyoung reflexes to rely on to avoid a fearful, telescoping collision. He\nflicked his wheel smoothly to the right; but the County Highway\nCommission hadn't yet tarred the traffic-loosened gravel at the Bend.\n\nNed could scarcely have chosen a worse place to start sliding and\nspinning. His car hit the white-painted wooden rail sideways, crashed\nthrough, tumbled down a steep slope, struck a huge boulder, bounced up a\nlittle, and arced outward, falling as gracefully as a swan-diver toward\nthe inky waters of the Pit, fifty feet beneath....\n\nNed Vince was still dimly conscious when that black, quiet pool geysered\naround him in a mighty splash. He had only a dazing welt on his\nforehead, and a gag of terror in his throat.\n\nMovement was slower now, as he began to sink, trapped inside his wrecked\ncar. Nothing that he could imagine could mean doom more certainly than\nthis. The Pit was a tremendously deep pocket in the ground, spring-fed.\nThe edges of that almost bottomless pool were caked with a rim of\nwhite--for the water, on which dead birds so often floated, was\nsurcharged with alkali. As that heavy, natronous liquid rushed up\nthrough the openings and cracks beneath his feet, Ned Vince knew that\nhis friends and his family would never see his body again, lost beyond\nrecovery in this abyss.\n\nThe car was deeply submerged. The light had blinked out on the\ndash-panel, leaving Ned in absolute darkness. A flood rushed in at the\nshattered window. He clawed at the door, trying to open it, but it was\njammed in the crash-bent frame, and he couldn't fight against the force\nof that incoming water. The welt, left by the blow he had received on\nhis forehead, put a thickening mist over his brain, so that he could not\nthink clearly. Presently, when he could no longer hold his breath,\nbitter liquid was sucked into his lungs.\n\nHis last thoughts were those of a drowning man. The machine-shop he and\nhis dad had had in Harwich. Betty Moore, with the smiling Irish\neyes--like in the song. Betty and he had planned to go to the State\nUniversity this Fall. They'd planned to be married sometime.... Goodbye,\nBetty ...\n\nThe ripples that had ruffled the surface waters in the Pit, quieted\nagain to glassy smoothness. The eternal stars shone calmly. The geologic\nDakota hills, which might have seen the dinosaurs, still bulked along\nthe highway. Time, the Brother of Death, and the Father of Change,\nseemed to wait....\n\n\n\n\"Kaalleee! Tik!... Tik, tik, tik!... Kaalleee!...\"\n\nThe excited cry, which no human throat could quite have duplicated\naccurately, arose thinly from the depths of a powder-dry gulch,\nwater-scarred from an inconceivable antiquity. The noon-day Sun was red\nand huge. The air was tenuous, dehydrated, chill.\n\n\"Kaalleee!... Tik, tik, tik!...\"\n\nAt first there was only one voice uttering those weird, triumphant\nsounds. Then other vocal organs took up that trilling wail, and those\nshort, sharp chuckles of eagerness. Other questioning, wondering notes\nmixed with the cadence. Lacking qualities identifiable as human, the\ndisturbance was still like the babble of a group of workmen who have\ndiscovered something remarkable.\n\nThe desolate expanse around the gulch, was all but without motion. The\nicy breeze tore tiny puffs of dust from grotesque, angling drifts of\nsoil, nearly waterless for eons. Patches of drab lichen grew here and\nthere on the up-jutting rocks, but in the desert itself, no other life\nwas visible. Even the hills had sagged away, flattened by incalculable\nages of erosion.\n\n\n\nAt a mile distance, a crumbling heap of rubble arose. Once it had been a\nbuilding. A gigantic, jagged mass of detritus slanted upward from its\ncrest--red debris that had once been steel. A launching catapult for the\nlast space ships built by the gods in exodus, perhaps it was--half a\nmillion years ago. Man was gone from the Earth. Glacial ages, war,\ndecadence, disease, and a final scattering of those ultimate superhumans\nto newer worlds in other solar systems, had done that.\n\n\"Kaalleee!... Tik, tik, tik!...\" The sounds were not human. They were\nmore like the chatter and wail of small desert animals.\n\nBut there was a seeming paradox here in the depths of that gulch, too.\nThe glint of metal, sharp and burnished. The flat, streamlined bulk of a\nflying machine, shiny and new. The bell-like muzzle of a strange\nexcavator-apparatus, which seemed to depend on a blast of atoms to clear\naway rock and soil. Thus the gulch had been cleared of the accumulated\nrubbish of antiquity. Man, it seemed, had a successor, as ruler of the\nEarth.\n\nLoy Chuk had flown his geological expedition out from the far lowlands\nto the east, out from the city of Kar-Rah. And he was very happy\nnow--flushed with a vast and unlooked-for success.\n\nHe crouched there on his haunches, at the dry bottom of the Pit. The\nbreeze rumpled his long, brown fur. He wasn't very different in\nappearance from his ancestors. A foot tall, perhaps, as he squatted\nthere in that antique stance of his kind. His tail was short and furred,\nhis undersides creamy. White whiskers spread around his inquisitive,\npink-tipped snout.\n\nBut his cranium bulged up and forward between shrewd, beady eyes,\nbetraying the slow heritage of time, of survival of the fittest, of\nevolution. He could think and dream and invent, and the civilization of\nhis kind was already far beyond that of the ancient Twentieth Century.\n\nLoy Chuk and his fellow workers were gathered, tense and gleeful, around\nthe things their digging had exposed to the daylight. There was a gob of\njunk--scarcely more than an irregular formation of flaky rust. But\nimbedded in it was a huddled form, brown and hard as old wood. The dry\nmud that had encased it like an airtight coffin, had by now been chipped\naway by the tiny investigators; but soiled clothing still clung to it,\nafter perhaps a million years. Metal had gone into decay--yes. But not\nthis body. The answer to this was simple--alkali. A mineral saturation\nthat had held time and change in stasis. A perfect preservative for\norganic tissue, aided probably during most of those passing eras by\ndesert dryness. The Dakotas had turned arid very swiftly. This body was\nnot a mere fossil. It was a mummy.\n\n\n\n\"Kaalleee!\" Man, that meant. Not the star-conquering demi-gods, but the\nancestral stock that had built the first machines on Earth, and in the\nearly Twenty-first Century, the first interplanetary rockets. No wonder\nLoy Chuk and his co-workers were happy in their paleontological\nenthusiasm! A strange accident, happening in a legendary antiquity, had\naided them in their quest for knowledge.\n\nAt last Loy Chuk gave a soft, chirping signal. The chant of triumph\nended, while instruments flicked in his tiny hands. The final instrument\nhe used to test the mummy, looked like a miniature stereoscope, with\ncomplicated details. He held it over his eyes. On the tiny screen\nwithin, through the agency of focused X-rays, he saw magnified images of\nthe internal organs of this ancient human corpse.\n\nWhat his probing gaze revealed to him, made his pleasure even greater\nthan before. In twittering, chattering sounds, he communicated his\nfurther knowledge to his henchmen. Though devoid of moisture, the mummy\nwas perfectly preserved, even to its brain cells! Medical and biological\nsciences were far advanced among Loy Chuk's kind. Perhaps, by the\napplication of principles long known to them, this long-dead body could\nbe made to live again! It might move, speak, remember its past! What a\nmarvelous subject for study it would make, back there in the museums of\nKar-Rah!\n\n\"Tik, tik, tik!...\"\n\nBut Loy silenced this fresh, eager chattering with a command. Work was\nalways more substantial than cheering.\n\n\n\nWith infinite care--small, sharp hand-tools were used, now--the mummy of\nNed Vince was disengaged from the worthless rust of his primitive\nautomobile. With infinite care it was crated in a metal case, and\nhauled into the flying machine.\n\nFlashing flame, the latter arose, bearing the entire hundred members of\nthe expedition. The craft shot eastward at bullet-like speed. The\nspreading continental plateau of North America seemed to crawl backward,\nbeneath. A tremendous sand desert, marked with low, washed-down\nmountains, and the vague, angular, geometric mounds of human cities that\nwere gone forever.\n\nBeyond the eastern rim of the continent, the plain dipped downward\nsteeply. The white of dried salt was on the hills, but there was a\nlittle green growth here, too. The dead sea-bottom of the vanished\nAtlantic was not as dead as the highlands.\n\nFar out in a deep valley, Kar-Rah, the city of the rodents, came into\nview--a crystalline maze of low, bubble-like structures, glinting in the\nred sunshine. But this was only its surface aspect. Loy Chuk's people\nhad built their homes mostly underground, since the beginning of their\nfoggy evolution. Besides, in this latter day, the nights were very cold,\nthe shelter of subterranean passages and rooms was welcome.\n\nThe mummy was taken to Loy Chuk's laboratory, a short distance below the\nsurface. Here at once, the scientist began his work. The body of the\nancient man was put in a large vat. Fluids submerged it, slowly soaking\nfrom that hardened flesh the alkali that had preserved it for so long.\nThe fluid was changed often, until woody muscles and other tissues\nbecame pliable once more.\n\nThen the more delicate processes began. Still submerged in liquid, the\ncorpse was submitted to a flow of restorative energy, passing between\ncomplicated electrodes. The cells of antique flesh and brain gradually\ntook on a chemical composition nearer to that of the life that they had\nonce known.\n\n\n\nAt last the final liquid was drained away, and the mummy lay there, a\nmummy no more, but a pale, silent figure in its tatters of clothing. Loy\nChuk put an odd, metal-fabric helmet on its head, and a second, much\nsmaller helmet on his own. Connected with this arrangement, was a black\nbox of many uses. For hours he worked with his apparatus, studying, and\nguiding the recording instruments. The time passed swiftly.\n\nAt last, eager and ready for whatever might happen now, Loy Chuk pushed\nanother switch. With a cold, rosy flare, energy blazed around that\nmoveless form.\n\nFor Ned Vince, timeless eternity ended like a gradual fading mist. When\nhe could see clearly again, he experienced that inevitable shock of vast\nchange around him. Though it had been dehydrated, his brain had been\nkept perfectly intact through the ages, and now it was restored. So his\nmemories were as vivid as yesterday.\n\nYet, through that crystalline vat in which he lay, he could see a broad,\nlow room, in which he could barely have stood erect. He saw instruments\nand equipment whose weird shapes suggested alienness, and knowledge\nbeyond the era he had known! The walls were lavender and phosphorescent.\nFossil bone-fragments were mounted in shallow cases. Dinosaur bones,\nsome of them seemed, from their size. But there was a complete skeleton\nof a dog, too, and the skeleton of a man, and a second man-skeleton that\nwas not quite human. Its neck-vertebrae were very thick and solid, its\nshoulders were wide, and its skull was gigantic.\n\nAll this weirdness had a violent effect on Ned Vince--a sudden,\nnostalgic panic. Something was fearfully wrong!\n\nThe nervous terror of the unknown was on him. Feeble and dizzy after his\nweird resurrection, which he could not understand, remembering as he did\nthat moment of sinking to certain death in the pool at Pit Bend, he\ncaught the edge of the transparent vat, and pulled himself to a sitting\nposture. There was a muffled murmur around him, as of some vast,\nun-Earthly metropolis.\n\n\"Take it easy, Ned Vince....\"\n\nThe words themselves, and the way they were assembled, were old,\nfamiliar friends. But the tone was wrong. It was high, shrill,\nparrot-like, and mechanical. Ned's gaze searched for the source of the\nvoice--located the black box just outside of his crystal vat. From that\nbox the voice seemed to have originated. Before it crouched a small,\nbrownish animal with a bulging head. The animal's tiny-fingered\npaws--hands they were, really--were touching rows of keys.\n\nTo Ned Vince, it was all utterly insane and incomprehensible. A rodent,\nlooking like a prairie dog, a little; but plainly possessing a high\norder of intelligence. And a voice whose soothingly familiar words were\nmore repugnant somehow, simply because they could never belong in a\nplace as eerie as this.\n\nNed Vince did not know how Loy Chuk had probed his brain, with the aid\nof a pair of helmets, and the black box apparatus. He did not know that\nin the latter, his language, taken from his own revitalized mind, was\nrecorded, and that Loy Chuk had only to press certain buttons to make\nthe instrument express his thoughts in common, long-dead English. Loy,\nwhose vocal organs were not human, would have had great difficulty\nspeaking English words, anyway.\n\nNed's dark hair was wildly awry. His gaunt, young face held befuddled\nterror. He gasped in the thin atmosphere. \"I've gone nuts,\" he\npronounced with a curious calm. \"Stark--starin'--nuts....\"\n\n\n\nLoy's box, with its recorded English words and its sonic detectors,\ncould translate for its master, too. As the man spoke, Loy read the\nilluminated symbols in his own language, flashed on a frosted crystal\nplate before him. Thus he knew what Ned Vince was saying.\n\nLoy Chuk pressed more keys, and the box reproduced his answer: \"No, Ned,\nnot nuts. Not a bit of it! There are just a lot of things that you've\ngot to get used to, that's all. You drowned about a million years ago. I\ndiscovered your body. I brought you back to life. We have science that\ncan do that. I'm Loy Chuk....\"\n\n\n\nIt took only a moment for the box to tell the full story in clear, bold,\nfriendly terms. Thus Loy sought, with calm, human logic, to make his\ncharge feel at home. Probably, though, he was a fool, to suppose that he\ncould succeed, thus.\n\nVince started to mutter, struggling desperately to reason it out. \"A\nprairie dog,\" he said. \"Speaking to me. One million years. Evolution.\nThe scientists say that people grew up from fishes in the sea. Prairie\ndogs are smart. So maybe super-prairie-dogs could come from them. A lot\neasier than men from fish....\"\n\nIt was all sound logic. Even Ned Vince knew that. Still, his mind, tuned\nto ordinary, simple things, couldn't quite realize all the vast things\nthat had happened to himself, and to the world. The scope of it all was\ntoo staggeringly big. One million years. God!...\n\nNed Vince made a last effort to control himself. His knuckles tightened\non the edge of the vat. \"I don't know what you've been talking about,\"\nhe grated wildly. \"But I want to get out of here! I want to go back\nwhere I came from! Do you understand--whoever, or whatever you are?\"\n\nLoy Chuk pressed more keys. \"But you can't go back to the Twentieth\nCentury,\" said the box. \"Nor is there any better place for you to be\nnow, than Kar-Rah. You are the only man left on Earth. Those men that\nexist in other star systems are not really your kind anymore, though\ntheir forefathers originated on this planet. They have gone far beyond\nyou in evolution. To them you would be only a senseless curiosity. You\nare much better off with my people--our minds are much more like yours.\nWe will take care of you, and make you comfortable....\"\n\nBut Ned Vince wasn't listening, now. \"You are the only man left on\nEarth.\" That had been enough for him to hear. He didn't more than half\nbelieve it. His mind was too confused for conviction about anything.\nEverything he saw and felt and heard might be some kind of nightmare.\nBut then it might all be real instead, and that was abysmal horror. Ned\nwas no coward--death and danger of any ordinary Earthly kind, he could\nhave faced bravely. But the loneliness here, and the utter strangeness,\nwere hideous like being stranded alone on another world!\n\nHis heart was pounding heavily, and his eyes were wide. He looked across\nthis eerie room. There was a ramp there at the other side, leading\nupward instead of a stairway. Fierce impulse to escape this nameless\nlair, to try to learn the facts for himself, possessed him. He bounded\nout of the vat, and with head down, dashed for the ramp.\n\n\n\nHe had to go most of the way on his hands and knees, for the up-slanting\npassage was low. Excited animal chucklings around him, and the\noccasional touch of a furry body, hurried his feverish scrambling. But\nhe emerged at last at the surface.\n\nHe stood there panting in that frigid, rarefied air. It was night. The\nMoon was a gigantic, pock-marked bulk. The constellations were\nunrecognizable. The rodent city was a glowing expanse of shallow,\ncrystalline domes, set among odd, scrub trees and bushes. The crags\nloomed on all sides, all their jaggedness lost after a million years of\nerosion under an ocean that was gone. In that ghastly moonlight, the\nground glistened with dry salt.\n\n\"Well, I guess it's all true, huh?\" Ned Vince muttered in a flat tone.\n\nBehind him he heard an excited, squeaky chattering. Rodents in pursuit.\nLooking back, he saw the pinpoint gleams of countless little eyes. Yes,\nhe might as well be an exile on another planet--so changed had the Earth\nbecome.\n\nA wave of intolerable homesickness came over him as he sensed the\ndistances of time that had passed--those inconceivable eons, separating\nhimself from his friends, from Betty, from almost everything that was\nfamiliar. He started to run, away from those glittering rodent eyes. He\nsensed death in that cold sea-bottom, but what of it? What reason did he\nhave left to live? He'd be only a museum piece here, a thing to be caged\nand studied....\n\nPrison or a madhouse would be far better. He tried to get hold of his\ncourage. But what was there to inspire it? Nothing! He laughed harshly\nas he ran, welcoming that bitter, killing cold. Nostalgia had him in its\nclutch, and there was no answer in his hell-world, lost beyond the\nbarrier of the years....\n\n\n\nLoy Chuk and his followers presently came upon Ned Vince's unconscious\nform, a mile from the city of Kar-Rah. In a flying machine they took him\nback, and applied stimulants. He came to, in the same laboratory room as\nbefore. But he was firmly strapped to a low platform this time, so that\nhe could not escape again. There he lay, helpless, until presently an\nidea occurred to him. It gave him a few crumbs of hope.\n\n\"Hey, somebody!\" he called.\n\n\"You'd better get some rest, Ned Vince,\" came the answer from the black\nbox. It was Loy Chuk speaking again.\n\n\"But listen!\" Ned protested. \"You know a lot more than we did in the\nTwentieth Century. And--well--there's that thing called time-travel,\nthat I used to read about. Maybe you know how to make it work! Maybe you\ncould send me back to my own time after all!\"\n\nLittle Loy Chuk was in a black, discouraged mood, himself. He could\nunderstand the utter, sick dejection of this giant from the past, lost\nfrom his own kind. Probably insanity looming. In far less extreme\ncircumstances than this, death from homesickness had come.\n\nLoy Chuk was a scientist. In common with all real scientists, regardless\nof the species from which they spring, he loved the subjects of his\nresearches. He wanted this ancient man to live and to be happy. Or this\ncreature would be of scant value for study.\n\nSo Loy considered carefully what Ned Vince had suggested. Time-travel.\nAlmost a legend. An assault upon an intangible wall that had baffled far\nkeener wits than Loy's. But he was bent, now, on the well-being of this\nanachronism he had so miraculously resurrected--this human, this\nKaalleee....\n\nLoy jabbed buttons on the black box. \"Yes, Ned Vince,\" said the sonic\napparatus. \"Time-travel. Perhaps that is the only thing to do--to send\nyou back to your own period of history. For I see that you will never be\nyourself, here. It will be hard to accomplish, but we'll try. Now I\nshall put you under an anesthetic....\"\n\nNed felt better immediately, for there was real hope now, where there\nhad been none before. Maybe he'd be back in his home-town of Harwich\nagain. Maybe he'd see the old machine-shop, there. And the trees\ngreening out in Spring. Maybe he'd be seeing Betty Moore in Hurley,\nsoon.... Ned relaxed, as a tiny hypo-needle bit into his arm....\n\nAs soon as Ned Vince passed into unconsciousness, Loy Chuk went to work\nonce more, using that pair of brain-helmets again, exploring carefully\nthe man's mind. After hours of research, he proceeded to prepare his\nplans. The government of Kar-Rah was a scientific oligarchy, of which\nLoy was a prime member. It would be easy to get the help he needed.\n\nA horde of small, grey-furred beings and their machines, toiled for many\ndays.\n\n\n\nNed Vince's mind swam gradually out of the blur that had enveloped it.\nHe was wandering aimlessly about in a familiar room. The girders of the\nroof above were of red-painted steel. His tool-benches were there,\ngreasy and littered with metal filings, just as they had always been. He\nhad a tractor to repair, and a seed-drill. Outside of the machine-shop,\nthe old, familiar yellow sun was shining. Across the street was the\nsmall brown house, where he lived.\n\nWith a sudden startlement, he saw Betty Moore in the doorway. She wore a\nblue dress, and a mischievous smile curved her lips. As though she had\nsucceeded in creeping up on him, for a surprise.\n\n\"Why, Ned,\" she chuckled. \"You look as though you've been dreaming, and\njust woke up!\"\n\nHe grimaced ruefully as she approached. With a kind of fierce gratitude,\nhe took her in his arms. Yes, she was just like always.\n\n\"I guess I _was_ dreaming, Betty,\" he whispered, feeling that mighty\nsense of relief. \"I must have fallen asleep at the bench, here, and had\na nightmare. I thought I had an accident at Pit Bend--and that a lot of\nworse things happened.... But it wasn't true ...\"\n\nNed Vince's mind, over which there was still an elusive fog that he did\nnot try to shake off, accepted apparent facts simply.\n\nHe did not know anything about the invisible radiations beating down\nupon him, soothing and dimming his brain, so that it would never\nquestion or doubt, or observe too closely the incongruous circumstances\nthat must often appear. The lack of traffic in the street without, for\ninstance--and the lack of people besides himself and Betty.\n\nHe didn't know that this machine-shop was built from his own memories of\nthe original. He didn't know that this Betty was of the same origin--a\nmiraculous fabrication of metal and energy-units and soft plastic. The\ntrees outside were only lantern-slide illusions.\n\nIt was all built inside a great, opaque dome. But there were hidden\ntelevision systems, too. Thus Loy Chuk's kind could study this ancient\nman--this Kaalleee. Thus, their motives were mostly selfish.\n\nLoy, though, was not observing, now. He had wandered far out into cold,\nsad sea-bottom, to ponder. He squeaked and chatted to himself,\ncontemplating the magnificent, inexorable march of the ages. He\nremembered the ancient ruins, left by the final supermen.\n\n\"The Kaalleee believes himself home,\" Loy was thinking. \"He will survive\nand be happy. But there was no other way. Time is an Eternal Wall. Our\narcheological researches among the cities of the supermen show the\ntruth. Even they, who once ruled Earth, never escaped from the present\nby so much as an instant....\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\nPRINTED IN U. S. A.\n\n",
