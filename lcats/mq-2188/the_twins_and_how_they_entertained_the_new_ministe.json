Rev. J. Jones, the minister.\n\n\n\n\nScene\n\nA reception room. Enter Betty and the minister.\n\nBETTY. (With a grown-up air.) There! Sit right down, and I\u2019ll see\nif Mamma\u2019s in. No, not that one, that\u2019s only for show. The leg\u2019s\nbroken, and it aint got fixed yet. Take the Morris chair. That\u2019s the\none sister\u2019s beaux always sit in. There, now you\u2019re all comfy. I\u2019ll\ntell Mamma you\u2019re here, if she\u2019s in.\n\nREV. J. JONES. Tell her that I am making pastoral calls. I am\u2014\n\nBETTY. Yes, I know who you are. \u201cI\u2019m the new minister,\u201d you was a\ngoing to say, wasn\u2019t you?\n\nBOBBY. (Entering.) \u2019Twas my turn to answer the doorbell, Betty\nForrest. \u2019Taint fair! You just camp out in the hall to get ahead of\nme! You got the book agent, and the Mission Lady, and now you\u2019ve got\nthe minister. Course you\u2019ll beat!\n\nREV. J. J. Beat?\n\nBETTY. You can tell him, Bobby, while I go ask Mamma if she\u2019s in.\nSometimes she\u2019s in when she isn\u2019t, and sometimes she isn\u2019t when she\nis, and the only way to be sure you won\u2019t get a whipping for telling\nit the wrong way, is to go ask her. She\u2019s in her room, I know, but\nmaybe she isn\u2019t in. You tell him \u2019bout the new game, Bobby. (She runs\nout.)\n\nBOBBY. It\u2019s what we call the Caller\u2019s game. Betty made it up. Betty\u2019s\nawful smart to think of new things. You see, Thursday afternoon is\nChristine\u2019s day out. Say, aint it funny to call an afternoon a day?\nAnd Mamma don\u2019t like to answer the bell herself, \u2019cause then she\ncouldn\u2019t be out if she didn\u2019t want to see the one that rung it, so she\nmade me and Betty do it, \u2019n course we hated to be bothered\u2014you know\ncallers are such a nuisance when you\u2019re busy playing, and Betty\nshirked and made me do it most all. So Daddy said if she didn\u2019t do her\nshare, he\u2019d bring home candy, and give it all to me, \u2019n then Betty she\nmade up this game. We\u2019ve each got a little book, and we put down which\ncaller we answer the bell to and get a piece of candy for each caller,\nand if there\u2019s more candy than there is callers, we get two pieces for\neach one, and now Betty likes to answer it, and she gets the most\ncandy every time.\n\nBETTY. (Returning.) That\u2019s \u2019cause I\u2019m smartest, Daddy says. He says,\n\u201cTrust a woman to get the best of a man every time, be they ever so\nyoung.\u201d\n\nREV. J. J. And what did Mamma say?\n\nBETTY. She said, \u201cMercy me! The minister? I suppose I shall have to go\ndown, or your Father won\u2019t like it.\u201d What are ministers made for?\n\nREV. J. J. I think I must go. Tell your mother I was sorry not to meet\nher.\n\nBETTY. But you got to see her. She\u2019ll be down soon as she puts on her\nhair and squeezes her feet into her new tango slippers.\n\nBOBBY. Pa says it\u2019s foolish to try to put a number two shoe on a\nnumber four foot.\n\nREV. J. J. (Rising.) I think I must go now.\n\nBETTY. If you do, she\u2019ll spank me good, for letting you, after she\nsaid she was in. She told me to entertain you nicely till she came\ndown.\n\nBOBBY. I\u2019ll entertain him. Men like men. Do you play poker?\n\nREV. J. J. Why no, do you?\n\nBOBBY. No, I aint learned how yet, but I thought you might teach me.\nThis cunning little table is a card table, and the cards are in this\nlittle drawer. (Takes them out.) And these pretty round things are the\nchips.\n\nBETTY. They look more like Tiddledy Winks. They use \u2019em \u2019stead of\nmoney, \u2019cause Mamma won\u2019t let \u2019em play for money. That\u2019s gambling.\n\nBOBBY. They pay the money down town, next day. I know, \u2019cause I was\nwith Daddy when he did, and he gave me a quarter not to tell Mamma.\n\u2019Sides, Mamma plays Bridge and that\u2019s just as bad, Daddy says.\n\nREV. J. J. Would they like you to tell me this?\n\nBETTY. P\u2019raps not, but you won\u2019t tell, will you? It\u2019s right to tell\nthe minister bad things, \u2019cause he\u2019ll forgive you if you pay him\nsomething, and you can do it over again. That\u2019s the way Christine\ndoes. She\u2019s a Catholic. Are you?\n\nREV. J. J. No indeed, my dear.\n\nBOBBY. (Who has gone out, re-enters with a bottle and glass.) Have\nsome wine? Daddy always entertains this way. It\u2019s a fine flavor. I\ndrank a bit from the bottom of a glass once, and \u2019twas awful good, but\nMamma was mad about it.\n\nREV. J. J. Put it back, my boy. I never drink. Ministers never do.\n\nBETTY. My, how thirsty you must get! What do you do when you\u2019ve been\neating salt fish?\n\nREV. J. J. I don\u2019t care for salt fish.\n\nBOBBY. Neither do we, but we eat a lot of it when we\u2019re saving up for\na party.\n\nBETTY. Can you dance the tango?\n\nREV. J. J. No, I don\u2019t dance.\n\nBETTY. That\u2019s too bad. Let me show you how. It\u2019s just as easy! Come\non. (Tries to drag him up.)\n\nREV. J. J. No, I don\u2019t care to dance.\n\nBETTY. I won\u2019t call you awkward, really. You do it so, you know,\n(illustrates) but dancing\u2019s no fun alone, you know. You need a girl to\nhug. If you learn with me you can do it with the big lady girls, the\nones that you like best, you know.\n\nBOBBY. He don\u2019t dance with \u2019em, he plays tag.\n\nREV. J. J. Oh no, my boy.\n\nBOBBY. Mamma said so. Daddy said that all the girls were chasing you,\nand Mamma said she guessed that you could do your share of the\nchasing, all right.\n\nBETTY. I know what you like\u2014fast horses, don\u2019t you?\n\nREV. J. J. Well, I have a horse, of course\u2014\n\nBETTY. Yes, a real spanker! And a narrow buggy to take the girls to\nride. Say, do you hold \u2019em in, when you go over the \u201cthank you marms\u201d\nand take toll? Daddy said he bet you did. He always used to. He calls\nit taking toll when he makes me pay him for candy with kisses. I\ns\u2019pose the girls would be afraid to say no to a minister, but\nsometimes I say no to Daddy, just to tease him, and he calls me a\nlittle flirt, and takes \u2019em just the same.\n\nREV. J. J. Indeed. How old are you, little girl?\n\nBETTY. I\u2019m eight, \u2019n so\u2019s Bobby. We\u2019re twins, but I\u2019m the smartest and\nthe prettiest. Daddy says so. Mamma\u2019s great for bargains, when she\u2019s\nshopping, \u2019n when she bought me, Bobby was throwed in. She didn\u2019t need\na boy, at all, but \u2019twas a bargain, you know. She bought a five dollar\nwaist yesterday for four dollars and ninety-five cents. Can you play\nthe piano?\n\nREV. J. J. No, can you?\n\nBETTY. I can play the scale, and \u201cTell Aunt Rhody,\u201d and when I\u2019m as\nbig as you, I shall play all the notes. You can\u2019t do much, can you? Is\nthat why you\u2019re a minister?\n\nBOBBY. No, it\u2019s \u2019cause it\u2019s an easy way to earn your living. Daddy\nsaid so. Just stand up in a pulpit and scold the people when they\ndassn\u2019t talk back, and have some men pass round plates to get money\nfor you. They don\u2019t dare not to \u2019cause folks is looking. Once Daddy\nput in a five dollar gold piece by mistake, and he sweared about it\nwhen he got home.\n\nBETTY. Yes, and last Sunday I put in my chewing gum by mistake and he\nspanked me \u2019cause I sweared about it when I got home. He said \u201cDarn!\u201d\nwas naughty for a girl to say. Why is it?\n\nREV. J. J. Because\u2014\n\nBETTY. Oh, I didn\u2019t \u2019spect you to tell me. I don\u2019t like to be preached\nat. Have you got any s\u2019criptions with you?\n\nREV. J. J. Prescriptions? I\u2019m not a druggist, nor a physician.\n\nBOBBY. Sub ones, she means. Mamma don\u2019t like \u2019em. She hates begging\nministers. She always signs, you know, \u2019cause she must, but she can\u2019t\nafford to give away a whole dollar, or even half a one, \u2019cause her\nclothes are awful \u2019spensive, and the dressmaker bothers her awfully\nwith bills. Oh, wouldn\u2019t you like a cigar? (Takes a cigar case from a\nstand and passes it.)\n\nREV. J. J. No indeed. I never smoke, and I hope you never will.\n\nBOBBY. Oh yes I will. It\u2019s lots nicer than chewing. Just you try. Or\nare you \u2019fraid it will make you sick? It did me, when I tried it, but\nI\u2019m going to try a cigarette next time. Taint so strong. P\u2019raps you\nbetter.\n\nBETTY. You better not. Maybe your Mamma wouldn\u2019t like it. Mamma\nspanked Bobby.\n\nREV. J. J. My dear boy, I sincerely hope\u2014\n\nBOBBY. Mamma\u2019s coming.\n\nBETTY. We\u2019ve entertained you good, haven\u2019t we? We haven\u2019t told\nanything we ought to not, have we? \u2019Cause if we have, we\u2019ll get\nspanked and sent to bed, when you\u2019re gone.\n\nBOBBY. If we have, don\u2019t you tell. Be a good sport, and don\u2019t tattle.\nHere comes Mamma.\n\nBETTY. And she\u2019s got her new dress on. We\u2019ve entertained him, Mamma!\n\n(Minister rises, as lady enters room, hand outstretched.)\n\n\nCURTAIN\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  New York               TULLAR-MEREDITH CO.

Danforth                 Music arr. by Geo. F. Rosche\n\nThis is a burlesque on the district school of 100 years ago. Ezekiel\nSimpkins, the teacher, is the central character. His costume is a\ntight Prince Albert coat, with brass buttons, or a worn and faded\n\u201cclaw-hammer\u201d coat; colored vest, cut low; stock collar, with large\nblack tie; trousers, \u201chigh-water,\u201d with a patch of other color on one\nknee; well-worn shoes. Bald gray wig and \u201cside\u201d whiskers. The costumes\nof the pupils are in keeping with those of the teacher.\n\nThe characters all read their lines from the book, so that there is\nvery little to be memorized and for this reason this work can be\nprepared in a very short time. _Price, postpaid, 50 cents per copy._\n\n\n  THE VISION OF HENSEL\n\n  An Evening with the old Songs\n\n  The Old Songs of Childhood, Youth, Love, War and Home\n\n  Libretto by Ellan N. Wood\n\nThere is no friend like an old friend and after all there are no songs\nwe love quite so much as the old ones. This Cantata furnishes a\nbeautiful medium for the introduction of the old songs which we all\nknow and love. There is just enough libretto to the work to form a\ncontinuous chain of thought throughout, and we know of no Cantata that\nwill afford such a pleasing entertainment at such a small expenditure\nof labor. The book is well worth its price if only to secure this fine\ncollection of old home songs. Full of sentiment, humor and pathos and\ndecidedly new and fresh in construction. _Price, 30 cts. per copy,\npostpaid; $3.00 per doz., not prepaid; add 3 cts. per copy for\npostage._\n\n\n  THE CHAPERON\n\n  A humorous Operetta in Three Acts\n\n  Libretto by Wm.

MacDONALD BARR              Music by CARL F. PRICE\n\nThe most interesting, mirth-provoking entertainment which we have been\nprivileged to see or hear in recent years.\n\nIt goes right to your funny bone with a new kind of tickle.\n\nIt provides a whole evening of the finest fun without for an instant\nsuggesting the vulgar or commonplace. There is a laugh in every line\nof the libretto and a lilt to every brace of music which makes it\nirresistible. The spell cannot be broken by the fall of the curtain\nfor the oft repeated strains of \u201cLove is the way to spell Living\u201d are\nsure to echo and re-echo long after the entertainment is over.\n\nThis entertainment is easily within the ability of the ordinary church\nchoir with augmented chorus. Special costumes are needed by only three\nor four characters, the chorus being in ordinary dress. No elaborate\nstage setting is necessary, a neat platform with an adjoining room, or\nwith a door, being the only requisites for its presentation. A piano\nshould be on the platform.\n\n\n  CAST\n\n  Professor Herr Lover, A little Anxious      _Tenor_\n  Xerxes Strong, A little Weak                 _Bass_\n  F.

He has proposed marriage to the leading soprano,\nLedgoline Topsee, but she is afraid he lacks the quality of patience,\nand plans, with the aid of her friends who compose the cast, to\nutilize the rehearsal to test him in that respect. After tolerating a\nseries of aggravating interruptions and delays on the part of the\nsingers, he at last gives away to a burst of angry passion, only to\ndiscover what he has lost by so doing. By a clever surrender, however,\nhe turns defeat into victory, and the affair ends happily.\n\nThis play given by your _Church Choir_, _Young People\u2019s Society_ or\n_Ladies\u2019 Aid_ will prove a financial success beyond your fondest\ndream. _Someone_ will give this in your vicinity. Why not be the first\nand reap the benefit for _your_ church or Society?\n\nThe price is 75 cents per copy with a small license fee for privilege\nof public performance for profit, but we have a special proposition to\noffer for its first appearance in each city or town.
