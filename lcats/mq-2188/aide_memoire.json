    "body": "Across the table from Retief, Ambassador Magnan rustled a stiff sheet\nof parchment and looked grave.\n\n\"This aide memoire,\" he said, \"was just handed to me by the Cultural\nAttache. It's the third on the subject this week. It refers to the\nmatter of sponsorship of Youth groups--\"\n\n\"Some youths,\" Retief said. \"Average age, seventy-five.\"\n\n\"The Fustians are a long-lived people,\" Magnan snapped. \"These matters\nare relative. At seventy-five, a male Fustian is at a trying age--\"\n\n\"That's right. He'll try anything--in the hope it will maim somebody.\"\n\n\"Precisely the problem,\" Magnan said. \"But the Youth Movement is\nthe important news in today's political situation here on Fust. And\nsponsorship of Youth groups is a shrewd stroke on the part of the\nTerrestrial Embassy. At my suggestion, well nigh every member of the\nmission has leaped at the opportunity to score a few p--that is, cement\nrelations with this emergent power group--the leaders of the future.\nYou, Retief, as Councillor, are the outstanding exception.\"\n\n\"I'm not convinced these hoodlums need my help in organizing their\nrumbles,\" Retief said. \"Now, if you have a proposal for a pest control\ngroup--\"\n\n\"To the Fustians this is no jesting matter,\" Magnan cut in. \"This\ngroup--\" he glanced at the paper--\"known as the Sexual, Cultural, and\nAthletic Recreational Society, or SCARS for short, has been awaiting\nsponsorship for a matter of weeks now.\"\n\n\"Meaning they want someone to buy them a clubhouse, uniforms, equipment\nand anything else they need to complete their sexual, cultural and\nathletic development,\" Retief said.\n\n\"If we don't act promptly,\" Magnan said, \"the Groaci Embassy may well\nanticipate us. They're very active here.\"\n\n\"That's an idea,\" said Retief. \"Let 'em. After awhile they'll go broke\ninstead of us.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. The group requires a sponsor. I can't actually order you to\nstep forward. However....\" Magnan let the sentence hang in the air.\nRetief raised one eyebrow.\n\n\"For a minute there,\" he said, \"I thought you were going to make a\npositive statement.\"\n\n\n\nMagnan leaned back, lacing his fingers over his stomach. \"I don't think\nyou'll find a diplomat of my experience doing anything so naive,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"I like the adult Fustians,\" said Retief. \"Too bad they have to lug\nhalf a ton of horn around on their backs. I wonder if surgery would\nhelp.\"\n\n\"Great heavens, Retief,\" Magnan sputtered. \"I'm amazed that even you\nwould bring up a matter of such delicacy. A race's unfortunate physical\ncharacteristics are hardly a fit matter for Terrestrial curiosity.\"\n\n\"Well, of course your experience of the Fustian mentality is greater\nthan mine. I've only been here a month. But it's been my experience,\nMr. Ambassador, that few races are above improving on nature. Otherwise\nyou, for example, would be tripping over your beard.\"\n\nMagnan shuddered. \"Please--never mention the idea to a Fustian.\"\n\nRetief stood. \"My own program for the day includes going over to the\ndockyards. There are some features of this new passenger liner the\nFustians are putting together that I want to look into. With your\npermission, Mr. Ambassador...?\"\n\nMagnan snorted. \"Your pre-occupation with the trivial disturbs me,\nRetief. More interest in substantive matters--such as working with\nYouth groups--would create a far better impression.\"\n\n\"Before getting too involved with these groups, it might be a good idea\nto find out a little more about them,\" said Retief. \"Who organizes\nthem? There are three strong political parties here on Fust. What's the\nalignment of this SCARS organization?\"\n\n\"You forget, these are merely teenagers, so to speak,\" Magnan said.\n\"Politics mean nothing to them ... yet.\"\n\n\"Then there are the Groaci. Why their passionate interest in a\ntwo-horse world like Fust? Normally they're concerned with nothing but\nbusiness. But what has Fust got that they could use?\"\n\n\"You may rule out the commercial aspect in this instance,\" said Magnan.\n\"Fust possesses a vigorous steel-age manufacturing economy. The Groaci\nare barely ahead of them.\"\n\n\"Barely,\" said Retief. \"Just over the line into crude atomics ... like\nfission bombs.\"\n\nMagnan shook his head, turned back to his papers. \"What market exists\nfor such devices on a world at peace? I suggest you address your\nattention to the less spectacular but more rewarding work of studying\nthe social patterns of the local youth.\"\n\n\"I've studied them,\" said Retief. \"And before I meet any of the local\nyouth socially I want to get myself a good blackjack.\"\n\n\n                                  II\n\nRetief left the sprawling bungalow-type building that housed the\nchancery of the Terrestrial Embassy, swung aboard a passing flat-car\nand leaned back against the wooden guard rail as the heavy vehicle\ntrundled through the city toward the looming gantries of the shipyards.\n\nIt was a cool morning. A light breeze carried the fishy odor of Fusty\ndwellings across the broad cobbled avenue. A few mature Fustians\nlumbered heavily along in the shade of the low buildings, audibly\nwheezing under the burden of their immense carapaces. Among them,\nshell-less youths trotted briskly on scaly stub legs. The driver of the\nflat-car, a labor-caste Fustian with his guild colors emblazoned on his\nback, heaved at the tiller, swung the unwieldy conveyance through the\nshipyard gates, creaked to a halt.\n\n\"Thus I come to the shipyard with frightful speed,\" he said in Fustian.\n\"Well I know the way of the naked-backs, who move always in haste.\"\n\nRetief climbed down, handed him a coin. \"You should take up\nprofessional racing,\" he said. \"Daredevil.\"\n\nHe crossed the littered yard and tapped at the door of a rambling shed.\nBoards creaked inside. Then the door swung back.\n\nA gnarled ancient with tarnished facial scales and a weathered carapace\npeered out at Retief.\n\n\"Long-may-you-sleep,\" said Retief. \"I'd like to take a look around, if\nyou don't mind. I understand you're laying the bedplate for your new\nliner today.\"\n\n\"May-you-dream-of-the-deeps,\" the old fellow mumbled. He waved a stumpy\narm toward a group of shell-less Fustians standing by a massive hoist.\n\"The youths know more of bedplates than do I, who but tend the place of\npapers.\"\n\n\"I know how you feel, old-timer,\" said Retief. \"That sounds like the\nstory of my life. Among your papers do you have a set of plans for the\nvessel? I understand it's to be a passenger liner.\"\n\nThe oldster nodded. He shuffled to a drawing file, rummaged, pulled out\na sheaf of curled prints and spread them on the table. Retief stood\nsilently, running a finger over the uppermost drawing, tracing lines....\n\n\"What does the naked-back here?\" barked a deep voice behind Retief. He\nturned. A heavy-faced Fustian youth, wrapped in a mantle, stood at the\nopen door. Beady yellow eyes set among fine scales bored into Retief.\n\n\"I came to take a look at your new liner,\" said Retief.\n\n\"We need no prying foreigners here,\" the youth snapped. His eye fell on\nthe drawings. He hissed in sudden anger.\n\n\"Doddering hulk!\" he snapped at the ancient. \"May you toss in\nnightmares! Put by the plans!\"\n\n\"My mistake,\" Retief said. \"I didn't know this was a secret project.\"\n\n\n\nThe youth hesitated. \"It is not a secret project,\" he muttered. \"Why\nshould it be secret?\"\n\n\"You tell me.\"\n\nThe youth worked his jaws and rocked his head from side to side in the\nFusty gesture of uncertainty. \"There is nothing to conceal,\" he said.\n\"We merely construct a passenger liner.\"\n\n\"Then you don't mind if I look over the drawings,\" said Retief. \"Who\nknows? Maybe some day I'll want to reserve a suite for the trip out.\"\n\nThe youth turned and disappeared. Retief grinned at the oldster. \"Went\nfor his big brother, I guess,\" he said. \"I have a feeling I won't get\nto study these in peace here. Mind if I copy them?\"\n\n\"Willingly, light-footed one,\" said the old Fustian. \"And mine is the\nshame for the discourtesy of youth.\"\n\nRetief took out a tiny camera, flipped a copying lens in place, leafed\nthrough the drawings, clicking the shutter.\n\n\"A plague on these youths,\" said the oldster, \"who grow more virulent\nday by day.\"\n\n\"Why don't you elders clamp down?\"\n\n\"Agile are they and we are slow of foot. And this unrest is new.\nUnknown in my youth was such insolence.\"\n\n\"The police--\"\n\n\"Bah!\" the ancient rumbled. \"None have we worthy of the name, nor have\nwe needed ought ere now.\"\n\n\"What's behind it?\"\n\n\"They have found leaders. The spiv, Slock, is one. And I fear they plot\nmischief.\" He pointed to the window. \"They come, and a Soft One with\nthem.\"\n\nRetief pocketed the camera, glanced out the window. A pale-featured\nGroaci with an ornately decorated crest stood with the youths, who eyed\nthe hut, then started toward it.\n\n\"That's the military attache of the Groaci Embassy,\" Retief said. \"I\nwonder what he and the boys are cooking up together?\"\n\n\"Naught that augurs well for the dignity of Fust,\" the oldster rumbled.\n\"Flee, agile one, while I engage their attentions.\"\n\n\"I was just leaving,\" Retief said. \"Which way out?\"\n\n\"The rear door,\" the Fustian gestured with a stubby member. \"Rest well,\nstranger on these shores.\" He moved to the entrance.\n\n\"Same to you, pop,\" said Retief. \"And thanks.\"\n\nHe eased through the narrow back entrance, waited until voices were\nraised at the front of the shed, then strolled off toward the gate.\n\n\n\nThe second dark of the third cycle was lightening when Retief left the\nEmbassy technical library and crossed the corridor to his office. He\nflipped on a light. A note was tucked under a paperweight:\n\n\"Retief--I shall expect your attendance at the IAS dinner at first\ndark of the fourth cycle. There will be a brief but, I hope, impressive\nSponsorship ceremony for the SCARS group, with full press coverage,\narrangements for which I have managed to complete in spite of your\nintransigence.\"\n\nRetief snorted and glanced at his watch. Less than three hours. Just\ntime to creep home by flat-car, dress in ceremonial uniform and creep\nback.\n\nOutside he flagged a lumbering bus. He stationed himself in a corner\nand watched the yellow sun, Beta, rise rapidly above the low skyline.\nThe nearby sea was at high tide now, under the pull of the major sun\nand the three moons, and the stiff breeze carried a mist of salt spray.\n\nRetief turned up his collar against the dampness. In half an hour he\nwould be perspiring under the vertical rays of a third-noon sun, but\nthe thought failed to keep the chill off.\n\nTwo Youths clambered up on the platform, moving purposefully toward\nRetief. He moved off the rail, watching them, weight balanced.\n\n\"That's close enough, kids,\" he said. \"Plenty of room on this scow. No\nneed to crowd up.\"\n\n\"There are certain films,\" the lead Fustian muttered. His voice was\nunusually deep for a Youth. He was wrapped in a heavy cloak and moved\nawkwardly. His adolescence was nearly at an end, Retief guessed.\n\n\"I told you once,\" said Retief. \"Don't crowd me.\"\n\nThe two stepped close, slit mouths snapping in anger. Retief put out a\nfoot, hooked it behind the scaly leg of the overaged juvenile and threw\nhis weight against the cloaked chest. The clumsy Fustian tottered, fell\nheavily. Retief was past him and off the flat-car before the other\nYouth had completed his vain lunge toward the spot Retief had occupied.\nThe Terrestrial waved cheerfully at the pair, hopped aboard another\nvehicle, watched his would-be assailants lumber down from their car,\ntiny heads twisted to follow his retreating figure.\n\nSo they wanted the film? Retief reflected, thumbing a cigar alight.\nThey were a little late. He had already filed it in the Embassy vault,\nafter running a copy for the reference files.\n\nAnd a comparison of the drawings with those of the obsolete Mark XXXV\nbattle cruiser used two hundred years earlier by the Concordiat Naval\nArm showed them to be almost identical, gun emplacements and all. The\nterm \"obsolete\" was a relative one. A ship which had been outmoded in\nthe armories of the Galactic Powers could still be king of the walk in\nthe Eastern Arm.\n\nBut how had these two known of the film? There had been no one present\nbut himself and the old-timer--and he was willing to bet the elderly\nFustian hadn't told them anything.\n\nAt least not willingly....\n\nRetief frowned, dropped the cigar over the side, waited until the\nflat-car negotiated a mud-wallow, then swung down and headed for the\nshipyard.\n\n\n\nThe door, hinges torn loose, had been propped loosely back in position.\nRetief looked around at the battered interior of the shed. The old\nfellow had put up a struggle.\n\nThere were deep drag-marks in the dust behind the building. Retief\nfollowed them across the yard. They disappeared under the steel door of\na warehouse.\n\nRetief glanced around. Now, at the mid-hour of the fourth cycle, the\nworkmen were heaped along the edge of the refreshment pond, deep in\ntheir siesta. He took a multi-bladed tool from a pocket, tried various\nfittings in the lock. It snicked open.\n\nHe eased the door aside far enough to enter.\n\nHeaped bales loomed before him. Snapping on the tiny lamp in the handle\nof the combination tool, Retief looked over the pile. One stack seemed\nout of alignment ... and the dust had been scraped from the floor\nbefore it. He pocketed the light, climbed up on the bales, looked over\ninto a nest made by stacking the bundles around a clear spot. The aged\nFustian lay in it, on his back, a heavy sack tied over his head.\n\nRetief dropped down inside the ring of bales, sawed at the tough twine\nand pulled the sack free.\n\n\"It's me, old fellow,\" Retief said. \"The nosy stranger. Sorry I got you\ninto this.\"\n\nThe oldster threshed his gnarled legs. He rocked slightly and fell\nback. \"A curse on the cradle that rocked their infant slumbers,\" he\nrumbled. \"But place me back on my feet and I hunt down the youth,\nSlock, though he flee to the bottommost muck of the Sea of Torments.\"\n\n\"How am I going to get you out of here? Maybe I'd better get some help.\"\n\n\"Nay. The perfidious Youths abound here,\" said the old Fustian. \"It\nwould be your life.\"\n\n\"I doubt if they'd go that far.\"\n\n\"Would they not?\" The Fustian stretched his neck. \"Cast your light\nhere. But for the toughness of my hide....\"\n\nRetief put the beam of the light on the leathery neck. A great smear of\nthick purplish blood welled from a ragged cut. The oldster chuckled, a\nsound like a seal coughing.\n\n\"Traitor, they called me. For long they sawed at me--in vain. Then\nthey trussed me and dumped me here. They think to return with weapons\nto complete the task.\"\n\n\"Weapons? I thought it was illegal!\"\n\n\"Their evil genius, the Soft One,\" said the Fustian. \"He would provide\nfuel to the Devil himself.\"\n\n\"The Groaci again,\" said Retief. \"I wonder what their angle is.\"\n\n\"And I must confess, I told them of you, ere I knew their full\nintentions. Much can I tell you of their doings. But first, I pray, the\nblock and tackle.\"\n\nRetief found the hoist where the Fustian directed him, maneuvered it\ninto position, hooked onto the edge of the carapace and hauled away.\nThe immense Fustian rose slowly, teetered ... then flopped on his chest.\n\nSlowly he got to his feet.\n\n\"My name is Whonk, fleet one,\" he said. \"My cows are yours.\"\n\n\"Thanks. I'm Retief. I'd like to meet the girls some time. But right\nnow, let's get out of here.\"\n\nWhonk leaned his bulk against the ponderous stacks of baled kelp,\nbulldozed them aside. \"Slow am I to anger,\" he said, \"but implacable in\nmy wrath. Slock, beware!\"\n\n\"Hold it,\" said Retief suddenly. He sniffed. \"What's that odor?\" He\nflashed the light around, played it over a dry stain on the floor. He\nknelt, sniffed at the spot.\n\n\"What kind of cargo was stacked here, Whonk? And where is it now?\"\n\nWhonk considered. \"There were drums,\" he said. \"Four of them, quite\nsmall, painted an evil green, the property of the Soft Ones, the\nGroaci. They lay here a day and a night. At full dark of the first\nperiod they came with stevedores and loaded them aboard the barge _Moss\nRock_.\"\n\n\"The VIP boat. Who's scheduled to use it?\"\n\n\"I know not. But what matters this? Let us discuss cargo movements\nafter I have settled a score with certain Youths.\"\n\n\"We'd better follow this up first, Whonk. There's only one substance I\nknow of that's transported in drums and smells like that blot on the\nfloor. That's titanite: the hottest explosive this side of a uranium\npile.\"\n\n\n                                  III\n\nBeta was setting as Retief, Whonk puffing at his heels, came up to the\nsentry box beside the gangway leading to the plush interior of the\nofficial luxury space barge _Moss Rock_.\n\n\"A sign of the times,\" said Whonk, glancing inside the empty shelter.\n\"A guard should stand here, but I see him not. Doubtless he crept away\nto sleep.\"\n\n\"Let's go aboard and take a look around.\"\n\nThey entered the ship. Soft lights glowed in utter silence. A rough box\nstood on the floor, rollers and pry-bars beside it--a discordant note\nin the muted luxury of the setting. Whonk rummaged in it.\n\n\"Curious,\" he said. \"What means this?\" He held up a stained cloak of\norange and green, a metal bracelet, papers.\n\n\"Orange and green,\" mused Relief. \"Whose colors are those?\"\n\n\"I know not.\" Whonk glanced at the arm-band. \"But this is lettered.\" He\npassed the metal band to Retief.\n\n\"SCARS,\" Retief read. He looked at Whonk. \"It seems to me I've heard\nthe name before,\" he murmured. \"Let's get back to the Embassy--fast.\"\n\nBack on the ramp Retief heard a sound ... and turned in time to duck\nthe charge of a hulking Fustian youth who thundered past him and\nfetched up against the broad chest of Whonk, who locked him in a warm\nembrace.\n\n\"Nice catch, Whonk. Where'd he sneak out of?\"\n\n\"The lout hid there by the storage bin,\" rumbled Whonk. The captive\nyouth thumped fists and toes fruitlessly against the oldster's carapace.\n\n\"Hang onto him,\" said Retief. \"He looks like the biting kind.\"\n\n\"No fear. Clumsy I am, yet not without strength.\"\n\n\"Ask him where the titanite is tucked away.\"\n\n\"Speak, witless grub,\" growled Whonk, \"lest I tweak you in twain.\"\n\nThe youth gurgled.\n\n\"Better let up before you make a mess of him,\" said Retief. Whonk\nlifted the Youth clear of the floor, then flung him down with a thump\nthat made the ground quiver. The younger Fustian glared up at the\nelder, mouth snapping.\n\n\"This one was among those who trussed me and hid me away for the\nkilling,\" said Whonk. \"In his repentance he will tell all to his elder.\"\n\n\"That's the same young squirt that tried to strike up an acquaintance\nwith me on the bus,\" Retief said. \"He gets around.\"\n\nThe youth scrambled to hands and knees, scuttled for freedom. Retief\nplanted a foot on his dragging cloak; it ripped free. He stared at the\nbare back of the Fustian--\n\n\"By the Great Egg!\" Whonk exclaimed, tripping the refugee as he tried\nto rise. \"This is no Youth! His carapace has been taken from him!\"\n\nRetief looked at the scarred back. \"I thought he looked a little old.\nBut I thought--\"\n\n\"This is not possible,\" Whonk said wonderingly. \"The great nerve trunks\nare deeply involved. Not even the cleverest surgeon could excise the\ncarapace and leave the patient living.\"\n\n\"It looks like somebody did the trick. But let's take this boy with us\nand get out of here. His folks may come home.\"\n\n\"Too late,\" said Whonk. Retief turned.\n\nThree youths came from behind the sheds.\n\n\"Well,\" Retief said. \"It looks like the SCARS are out in force tonight.\nWhere's your pal?\" he said to the advancing trio. \"The sticky little\nbird with the eye-stalks? Back at his Embassy, leaving you suckers\nholding the bag, I'll bet.\"\n\n\"Shelter behind me, Retief,\" said Whonk.\n\n\"Go get 'em, old-timer.\" Retief stooped, picked up one of the pry-bars.\n\"I'll jump around and distract them.\"\n\nWhonk let out a whistling roar and charged for the immature Fustians.\nThey fanned out ... and one tripped, sprawled on his face. Retief\nwhirled the metal bar he had thrust between the Fustian's legs, slammed\nit against the skull of another, who shook his head, turned on\nRetief ... and bounced off the steel hull of the _Moss Rock_ as Whonk\ntook him in full charge.\n\nRetief used the bar on another head. His third blow laid the Fustian\non the pavement, oozing purple. The other two club members departed\nhastily, seriously dented but still mobile.\n\nRetief leaned on his club, breathing hard. \"Tough heads these kids\nhave got. I'm tempted to chase those two lads down, but I've got\nanother errand to run. I don't know who the Groaci intended to blast,\nbut I have a sneaking suspicion somebody of importance was scheduled\nfor a boat ride in the next few hours. And three drums of titanite is\nenough to vaporize this tub and everyone aboard her.\"\n\n\"The plot is foiled,\" said Whonk. \"But what reason did they have?\"\n\n\"The Groaci are behind it. I have an idea the SCARS didn't know about\nthis gambit.\"\n\n\"Which of these is the leader?\" asked Whonk. He prodded a fallen Youth\nwith a horny toe. \"Arise, dreaming one.\"\n\n\"Never mind him, Whonk. We'll tie these two up and leave them here. I\nknow where to find the boss.\"\n\n\n\nA stolid crowd filled the low-ceilinged banquet hall. Retief scanned\nthe tables for the pale blobs of Terrestrial faces, dwarfed by the\ngiant armored bodies of the Fustians. Across the room Magnan fluttered\na hand. Retief headed toward him. A low-pitched vibration filled the\nair: the rumble of subsonic Fustian music.\n\nRetief slid into his place beside Magnan. \"Sorry to be late, Mr.\nAmbassador.\"\n\n\"I'm honored that you chose to appear at all,\" said Magnan coldly. He\nturned back to the Fustian on his left.\n\n\"Ah, yes, Mr. Minister,\" he said. \"Charming, most charming. So joyous.\"\n\nThe Fustian looked at him, beady-eyed. \"It is the _Lament of\nHatching_,\" he said; \"our National Dirge.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Magnan. \"How interesting. Such a pleasing balance of\ninstruments--\"\n\n\"It is a droon solo,\" said the Fustian, eyeing the Terrestrial\nAmbassador suspiciously.\n\n\"Why don't you just admit you can't hear it,\" Retief whispered loudly.\n\"And if I may interrupt a moment--\"\n\nMagnan cleared his throat. \"Now that our Mr. Retief has arrived,\nperhaps we could rush right along to the Sponsorship ceremonies.\"\n\n\"This group,\" said Retief, leaning across Magnan, \"the SCARS. How much\ndo you know about them, Mr. Minister?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all,\" the huge Fustian elder rumbled. \"For my taste, all\nYouths should be kept penned with the livestock until they grow a\ncarapace to tame their irresponsibility.\"\n\n\"We mustn't lose sight of the importance of channeling youthful\nenergies,\" said Magnan.\n\n\"Labor gangs,\" said the minister. \"In my youth we were indentured to\nthe dredge-masters. I myself drew a muck sledge.\"\n\n\"But in these modern times,\" put in Magnan, \"surely it's incumbent on\nus to make happy these golden hours.\"\n\nThe minister snorted. \"Last week I had a golden hour. They set upon me\nand pelted me with overripe stench-fruit.\"\n\n\"But this was merely a manifestation of normal youthful frustrations,\"\ncried Magnan. \"Their essential tenderness--\"\n\n\"You'd not find a tender spot on that lout yonder,\" the minister\nsaid, pointing with a fork at a newly arrived Youth, \"if you drilled\nboreholes and blasted.\"\n\n\n\n\"Why, that's our guest of honor,\" said Magnan, \"a fine young fellow!\nSlop I believe his name is.\"\n\n\"Slock,\" said Retief. \"Eight feet of armor-plated orneriness. And--\"\n\nMagnan rose and tapped on his glass. The Fustians winced at the, to\nthem, supersonic vibrations. They looked at each other muttering.\nMagnan tapped louder. The Minister drew in his head, eyes closed. Some\nof the Fustians rose, tottered for the doors; the noise level rose.\nMagnan redoubled his efforts. The glass broke with a clatter and green\nwine gushed on the tablecloth.\n\n\"What in the name of the Great Egg!\" the Minister muttered. He blinked,\nbreathing deeply.\n\n\"Oh, forgive me,\" blurted Magnan, dabbing at the wine.\n\n\"Too bad the glass gave out,\" said Retief. \"In another minute you'd\nhave cleared the hall. And then maybe I could have gotten a word in\nsideways. There's a matter you should know about--\"\n\n\"Your attention, please,\" Magnan said, rising. \"I see that our fine\nyoung guest has arrived, and I hope that the remainder of his committee\nwill be along in a moment. It is my pleasure to announce that our Mr.\nRetief has had the good fortune to win out in the keen bidding for the\npleasure of sponsoring this lovely group.\"\n\nRetief tugged at Magnan's sleeve. \"Don't introduce me yet,\" he said. \"I\nwant to appear suddenly. More dramatic, you know.\"\n\n\"Well,\" murmured Magnan, glancing down at Retief, \"I'm gratified to\nsee you entering into the spirit of the event at last.\" He turned his\nattention back to the assembled guests. \"If our honored guest will join\nme on the rostrum...?\" he said. \"The gentlemen of the press may want to\ncatch a few shots of the presentation.\"\n\nMagnan stepped up on the low platform at the center of the wide room,\ntook his place beside the robed Fustian youth and beamed at the cameras.\n\n\"How gratifying it is to take this opportunity to express once more the\ngreat pleasure we have in sponsoring SCARS,\" he said, talking slowly\nfor the benefit of the scribbling reporters. \"We'd like to think that\nin our modest way we're to be a part of all that the SCARS achieve\nduring the years ahead.\"\n\nMagnan paused as a huge Fustian elder heaved his bulk up the two low\nsteps to the rostrum, approached the guest of honor. He watched as the\nnewcomer paused behind Slock, who did not see the new arrival.\n\nRetief pushed through the crowd, stepped up to face the Fustian youth.\nSlock stared at him, drew back.\n\n\"You know me, Slock,\" said Retief loudly. \"An old fellow named Whonk\ntold you about me, just before you tried to saw his head off, remember?\nIt was when I came out to take a look at that battle cruiser you're\nbuilding.\"\n\n\n                                  IV\n\nWith a bellow Slock reached for Retief--and choked off in mid-cry as\nthe Fustian elder, Whonk, pinioned him from behind, lifting him clear\nof the floor.\n\n\"Glad you reporters happened along,\" said Retief to the gaping newsmen.\n\"Slock here had a deal with a sharp operator from the Groaci Embassy.\nThe Groaci were to supply the necessary hardware and Slock, as foreman\nat the shipyards, was to see that everything was properly installed.\nThe next step, I assume, would have been a local take-over, followed\nby a little interplanetary war on Flamenco or one of the other nearby\nworlds ... for which the Groaci would be glad to supply plenty of ammo.\"\n\nMagnan found his tongue. \"Are you mad, Retief?\" he screeched. \"This\ngroup was vouched for by the Ministry of Youth!\"\n\n\"The Ministry's overdue for a purge,\" snapped Retief. He turned back\nto Slock. \"I wonder if you were in on the little diversion that was\nplanned for today. When the _Moss Rock_ blew, a variety of clues were\nto be planted where they'd be easy to find ... with SCARS written all\nover them. The Groaci would thus have neatly laid the whole affair\nsquarely at the door of the Terrestrial Embassy ... whose sponsorship\nof the SCARS had received plenty of publicity.\"\n\n\"The _Moss Rock_?\" said Magnan. \"But that was--Retief! This is idiotic.\nSlock himself was scheduled to go on a cruise tomorrow!\"\n\nSlock roared suddenly, twisting violently. Whonk teetered, his grip\nloosened ... and Slock pulled free and was off the platform, butting\nhis way through the milling oldsters on the dining room floor. Magnan\nwatched, open-mouthed.\n\n\"The Groaci were playing a double game, as usual,\" Retief said. \"They\nintended to dispose of this fellow Slock, once he'd served their\npurpose.\"\n\n\"Well, don't stand there,\" yelped Magnan over the uproar. \"If Slock is\nthe ring-leader of a delinquent gang...!\" He moved to give chase.\n\nRetief grabbed his arm. \"Don't jump down there! You'd have as much\nchance of getting through as a jack-rabbit through a threshing contest.\"\n\nTen minutes later the crowd had thinned slightly. \"We can get through\nnow,\" Whonk called. \"This way.\" He lowered himself to the floor, bulled\nthrough to the exit. Flashbulbs popped. Retief and Magnan followed in\nWhonk's wake.\n\nIn the lounge Retief grabbed the phone, waited for the operator, gave a\ncode letter. No reply. He tried another.\n\n\"No good,\" he said after a full minute had passed. \"Wonder what's\nloose?\" He slammed the phone back in its niche. \"Let's grab a cab.\"\n\n\n\nIn the street the blue sun, Alpha, peered like an arc light under a low\ncloud layer, casting flat shadows across the mud of the avenue. The\nthree mounted a passing flat-car. Whonk squatted, resting the weight of\nhis immense shell on the heavy plank flooring.\n\n\"Would that I too could lose this burden, as has the false youth we\nbludgeoned aboard the _Moss Rock_,\" he sighed. \"Soon will I be forced\ninto retirement. Then a mere keeper of a place of papers such as I\nwill rate no more than a slab on the public strand, with once-daily\nfeedings. And even for a man of high position, retirement is no\npleasure. A slab in the Park of Monuments is little better. A dismal\noutlook for one's next thousand years!\"\n\n\"You two carry on to the police station,\" said Retief. \"I want to play\na hunch. But don't take too long. I may be painfully right.\"\n\n\"What--?\" Magnan started.\n\n\"As you wish, Retief,\" said Whonk.\n\nThe flat-car trundled past the gate to the shipyard and Retief jumped\ndown, headed at a run for the VIP boat. The guard post still stood\nvacant. The two Youths whom he and Whonk had left trussed were gone.\n\n\"That's the trouble with a peaceful world,\" Retief muttered. \"No police\nprotection.\" He stepped down from the lighted entry and took up a\nposition behind the sentry box. Alpha rose higher, shedding a glaring\nblue-white light without heat. Retief shivered. Maybe he'd guessed\nwrong....\n\nThere was a sound in the near distance, like two elephants colliding.\n\nRetief looked toward the gate. His giant acquaintance, Whonk, had\nreappeared and was grappling with a hardly less massive opponent. A\nsmall figure became visible in the melee, scuttled for the gate. Headed\noff by the battling titans, he turned and made for the opposite side\nof the shipyard. Retief waited, jumped out and gathered in the fleeing\nGroaci.\n\n\"Well, Yith,\" he said, \"how's tricks? You should pardon the expression.\"\n\n\"Release me, Retief!\" the pale-featured alien lisped, his throat\nbladder pulsating in agitation. \"The behemoths vie for the privilege of\ndismembering me out of hand!\"\n\n\"I know how they feel. I'll see what I can do ... for a price.\"\n\n\"I appeal to you,\" Yith whispered hoarsely. \"As a fellow diplomat, a\nfellow alien, a fellow soft-back--\"\n\n\"Why don't you appeal to Slock, as a fellow skunk?\" said Retief. \"Now\nkeep quiet ... and you may get out of this alive.\"\n\nThe heavier of the two struggling Fustians threw the other to the\nground. There was another brief flurry, and then the smaller figure was\non its back, helpless.\n\n\"That's Whonk, still on his feet,\" said Retief. \"I wonder who he's\ncaught--and why.\"\n\nWhonk came toward the _Moss Rock_ dragging the supine Fustian, who\nkicked vainly. Retief thrust Yith down well out of sight behind the\nsentry box. \"Better sit tight, Yith. Don't try to sneak off; I can\noutrun you. Stay here and I'll see what I can do.\" He stepped out and\nhailed Whonk.\n\nPuffing like a steam engine Whonk pulled up before him. \"Sleep,\nRetief!\" He panted. \"You followed a hunch; I did the same. I saw\nsomething strange in this one when we passed him on the avenue. I\nwatched, followed him here. Look! It is Slock, strapped into a dead\ncarapace! Now many things become clear.\"\n\n\n\nRetief whistled. \"So the Youths aren't all as young as they look.\nSomebody's been holding out on the rest of you Fustians!\"\n\n\"The Soft One,\" Whonk said. \"You laid him by the heels, Retief. I saw.\nProduce him now.\"\n\n\"Hold on a minute, Whonk. It won't do you any good--\"\n\nWhonk winked broadly. \"I must take my revenge!\" he roared. \"I shall\ntest the texture of the Soft One! His pulped remains will be scoured up\nby the ramp-washers and mailed home in bottles!\"\n\nRetief whirled at a sound, caught up with the scuttling Yith fifty feet\naway, hauled him back to Whonk.\n\n\"It's up to you, Whonk,\" he said. \"I know how important ceremonial\nrevenge is to you Fustians. I will not interfere.\"\n\n\"Mercy!\" Yith hissed, eye-stalks whipping in distress. \"I claim\ndiplomatic immunity!\"\n\n\"No diplomat am I,\" rumbled Whonk. \"Let me see; suppose I start with\none of those obscenely active eyes--\" He reached....\n\n\"I have an idea,\" said Retief brightly. \"Do you suppose--just this\nonce--you could forego the ceremonial revenge if Yith promised to\narrange for a Groaci Surgical Mission to de-carapace you elders?\"\n\n\"But,\" Whonk protested, \"those eyes! What a pleasure to pluck them, one\nby one!\"\n\n\"Yess,\" hissed Yith, \"I swear it! Our most expert surgeons ... platoons\nof them, with the finest of equipment.\"\n\n\"I have dreamed of how it would be to sit on this one, to feel him\nsquash beneath my bulk....\"\n\n\"Light as a whissle feather shall you dance,\" Yith whispered.\n\"Shell-less shall you spring in the joy of renewed youth--\"\n\n\"Maybe just one eye,\" said Whonk grudgingly. \"That would leave him\nfour.\"\n\n\"Be a sport,\" said Retief.\n\n\"Well.\"\n\n\"It's a deal then,\" said Retief. \"Yith, on your word as a diplomat,\nan alien, a soft-back and a skunk, you'll set up the mission. Groaci\nsurgical skill is an export that will net you more than armaments.\nIt will be a whissle feather in your cap--if you bring it off. And\nin return, Whonk won't sit on you. And I won't prefer charges of\ninterference in the internal affairs of a free world.\"\n\nBehind Whonk there was a movement. Slock, wriggling free of the\nborrowed carapace, struggled to his feet ... in time for Whonk to seize\nhim, lift him high and head for the entry to the _Moss Rock_.\n\n\"Hey,\" Retief called. \"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"I would not deny this one his reward,\" called Whonk. \"He hoped to\ncruise in luxury. So be it.\"\n\n\"Hold on,\" said Retief. \"That tub is loaded with titanite!\"\n\n\"Stand not in my way, Retief. For this one in truth owes me a\nvengeance.\"\n\nRetief watched as the immense Fustian bore his giant burden up the ramp\nand disappeared within the ship.\n\n\"I guess Whonk means business,\" he said to Yith, who hung in his grasp,\nall five eyes goggling. \"And he's a little too big for me to stop.\"\n\nWhonk reappeared, alone, climbed down.\n\n\"What did you do with him?\" said Retief. \"Tell him you were going to--\"\n\n\"We had best withdraw,\" said Whonk. \"The killing radius of the drive is\nfifty yards.\"\n\n\"You mean--\"\n\n\"The controls are set for Groaci. Long-may-he-sleep.\"\n\n\n\n\"It was quite a bang,\" said Retief. \"But I guess you saw it, too.\"\n\n\"No, confound it,\" Magnan said. \"When I remonstrated with Hulk, or\nWhelk--\"\n\n\"Whonk.\"\n\n\"--the ruffian thrust me into an alley bound in my own cloak. I'll most\ncertainly complain to the Minister.\"\n\n\"How about the surgical mission?\"\n\n\"A most generous offer,\" said Magnan. \"Frankly, I was astonished. I\nthink perhaps we've judged the Groaci too harshly.\"\n\n\"I hear the Ministry of Youth has had a rough morning of it,\" said\nRetief. \"And a lot of rumors are flying to the effect that Youth Groups\nare on the way out.\"\n\nMagnan cleared his throat, shuffled papers. \"I--ah--have explained to\nthe press that last night's--ah--\"\n\n\"Fiasco.\"\n\n\"--affair was necessary in order to place the culprits in an untenable\nposition. Of course, as to the destruction of the VIP vessel and the\npresumed death of, uh, Slop.\"\n\n\"The Fustians understand,\" said Retief. \"Whonk wasn't kidding about\nceremonial vengeance.\"\n\n\"The Groaci had been guilty of gross misuse of diplomatic privilege,\"\nsaid Magnan. \"I think that a note--or perhaps an Aide Memoire: less\nformal....\"\n\n\"The _Moss Rock_ was bound for Groaci,\" said Retief. \"She was already\nin her transit orbit when she blew. The major fragments will arrive on\nschedule in a month or so. It should provide quite a meteorite display.\nI think that should be all the _aide_ the Groaci's _memoires_ will need\nto keep their tentacles off Fust.\"\n\n\"But diplomatic usage--\"\n\n\"Then, too, the less that's put in writing, the less they can blame you\nfor, if anything goes wrong.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said Magnan, lips pursed. \"Now you're thinking\nconstructively, Retief. We may make a diplomat of you yet.\" He smiled\nexpansively.\n\n\"Maybe. But I refuse to let it depress me.\" Retief stood up. \"I'm\ntaking a few weeks off ... if you have no objection, Mr. Ambassador. My\npal Whonk wants to show me an island down south where the fishing is\ngood.\"\n\n\"But there are some extremely important matters coming up,\" said\nMagnan. \"We're planning to sponsor Senior Citizen Groups--\"\n\n\"Count me out. All groups give me an itch.\"\n\n\"Why, what an astonishing remark, Retief! After all, we diplomats are\nourselves a group.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" Retief said.\n\nMagnan sat quietly, mouth open, and watched as Retief stepped into the\nhall and closed the door gently behind him.",
