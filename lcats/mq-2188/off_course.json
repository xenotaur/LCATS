    "body": "First on the scene were Larry Dermott and Tim Casey of the State Highway\nPatrol. They assumed they were witnessing the crash of a new type of Air\nForce plane and slipped and skidded desperately across the field to\nwithin thirty feet of the strange craft, only to discover that the\nlanding had been made without accident.\n\nPatrolman Dermott shook his head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking every\nyear. Get a load of it--no wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\nThey left the car and made their way toward the strange egg-shaped\nvessel.\n\nTim Casey loosened his .38 in its holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm\nbeginning to wonder if it's one of ours. No insignia and--\"\n\nA circular door slid open at that point and Dameri Tass stepped out,\nyawning. He spotted them, smiled and said, \"Glork.\"\n\nThey gaped at him.\n\n\"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\nTim Casey closed his mouth with an effort. \"Do you mind the color of his\nface?\" he blurted.\n\n\"How could I help it?\"\n\nDameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed pink hand down his purplish countenance\nand yawned again. \"Gorra manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\nPatrolman Dermott and Patrolman Casey shot stares at each other. \"'Tis\ndouble talk he's after givin' us,\" Casey said.\n\nDameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\" he asked.\n\nLarry Dermott pushed his cap to the back of his head. \"That doesn't\nsound like any language I've even _heard_ about.\"\n\nDameri Tass grimaced, turned and reentered his spacecraft to emerge in\nhalf a minute with his hands full of contraption. He held a box-like\narrangement under his left arm; in his right hand were two metal caps\nconnected to the box by wires.\n\nWhile the patrolmen watched him, he set the box on the ground, twirled\ntwo dials and put one of the caps on his head. He offered the other to\nLarry Dermott; his desire was obvious.\n\nTrained to grasp a situation and immediately respond in manner best\nsuited to protect the welfare of the people of New York State, Dermott\ncleared his throat and said, \"Tim, take over while I report.\"\n\n\"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his fellow minion had left.\n\n\"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\" Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be puttin'\nthat dingus on my head for all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\"Mandaia,\" the stranger said impatiently.\n\n\"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye can't--\"\n\nDermott called from the car, \"Tim, the captain says to humor this guy.\nWe're to keep him here until the officials arrive.\"\n\nTim Casey closed his eyes and groaned. \"Humor him, he's after sayin'.\nOrders it is.\" He shouted back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's in\ntechnicolor? Begorra, he looks like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\"That's what they think,\" Larry yelled, \"and the governor is on his way.\nWe're to do everything possible short of violence to keep this character\nhere. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass snapped, pushing the cap into Casey's reluctant\nhands.\n\nMuttering his protests, Casey lifted it gingerly and placed it on his\nhead. Not feeling any immediate effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied\nye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\nThe alien stooped down and flicked a switch on the little box. It\nhummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly shrieked and sat down on the stubble\nand grass of the field. \"Begorra,\" he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\" He\ntore the cap from his head.\n\nHis companion came running, \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he shouted.\n\nDameri Tass removed the metal cap from his own head. \"Sure, an' nothin'\nis after bein' the matter with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the bhoy has\nniver been a-wearin' of a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt him not at\nall.\"\n\n\n\n\"You can talk!\" Dermott blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\nDameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an' why not? As I was after sayin', I\nshared the kerit helmet with Tim Casey.\"\n\nPatrolman Dermott glared at him unbelievingly. \"You learned the language\njust by sticking that Rube Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\nDermott muttered, \"And with it he has to pick up the corniest brogue\nwest of Dublin.\"\n\nTim Casey got to his feet indignantly. \"I'm after resentin' that, Larry\nDermott. Sure, an' the way we talk in Ireland is--\"\n\nDameri Tass interrupted, pointing to a bedraggled horse that had made\nits way to within fifty feet of the vessel. \"Now what could that be\nafter bein'?\"\n\nThe patrolmen followed his stare. \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\"A horse?\"\n\nLarry Dermott looked again, just to make sure. \"Yeah--not much of a\nhorse, but a horse.\"\n\nDameri Tass sighed ecstatically. \"And jist what is a horse, if I may be\nso bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\nThe alien tore his gaze from the animal to look his disbelief at the\nother. \"Are you after meanin' that you climb upon the crature's back and\nride him? Faith now, quit your blarney.\"\n\nHe looked at the horse again, then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\" he\nmuttered, \"I'll share the kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously. He was beginning to feel like a\ncharacter in a shaggy dog story.\n\nInterest in the horse was ended with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.\nIt swooped down on the field and settled within twenty feet of the alien\ncraft. Almost before it had touched, the door was flung open and the\nflying windmill disgorged two bestarred and efficient-looking Army\nofficers.\n\nCasey and Dermott snapped them a salute.\n\nThe senior general didn't take his eyes from the alien and the\nspacecraft as he spoke, and they bugged quite as effectively as had\nthose of the patrolmen when they'd first arrived on the scene.\n\n\"I'm Major General Browning,\" he rapped. \"I want a police cordon thrown\nup around this, er, vessel. No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody without my\npermission. As soon as Army personnel arrives, we'll take over\ncompletely.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I just got a report on the radio that\nthe governor is on his way, sir. How about him?\"\n\nThe general muttered something under his breath. Then, \"When the\ngovernor arrives, let me know; otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\nDameri Tass said, \"Faith, and what goes on?\"\n\nThe general's eyes bugged still further. \"_He talks!_\" he accused.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He had some kind of a machine. He put it over\nTim's head and seconds later he could talk.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\nFurther discussion was interrupted by the screaming arrival of several\nmotorcycle patrolmen followed by three heavily laden patrol cars.\nOverhead, pursuit planes zoomed in and began darting about nervously\nabove the field.\n\n\"Sure, and it's quite a reception I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.\nHe yawned. \"But what I'm wantin' is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,\nan' I've been awake for almost a _decal_.\"\n\n\n\nDameri Tass was hurried, via helicopter, to Washington. There he\ndisappeared for several days, being held incommunicado while White\nHouse, Pentagon, State Department and Congress tried to figure out just\nwhat to do with him.\n\nNever in the history of the planet had such a furor arisen. Thus far, no\nnewspapermen had been allowed within speaking distance. Administration\nhigher-ups were being subjected to a volcano of editorial heat but the\nlonger the space alien was discussed the more they viewed with alarm the\nsituation his arrival had precipitated. There were angles that hadn't at\nfirst been evident.\n\nObviously he was from some civilization far beyond that of Earth's. That\nwas the rub. No matter what he said, it would shake governments,\npossibly overthrow social systems, perhaps even destroy established\nreligious concepts.\n\nBut they couldn't keep him under wraps indefinitely.\n\nIt was the United Nations that cracked the iron curtain. Their demands\nthat the alien be heard before their body were too strong and had too\nmuch public opinion behind them to be ignored. The White House yielded\nand the date was set for the visitor to speak before the Assembly.\n\nExcitement, anticipation, blanketed the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,\nmulti-millionaires in Switzerland, fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in the\nArgentine were raised to a zenith of expectation. Panhandlers debated\nthe message to come with pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued it with\ntheir passengers; miners discussed it deep beneath the surface; pilots\nargued with their co-pilots thousands of feet above.\n\nIt was the most universally awaited event of the ages.\n\nBy the time the delegates from every nation, tribe, religion, class,\ncolor, and race had gathered in New York to receive the message from the\nstars, the majority of Earth had decided that Dameri Tass was the\nplenipotentiary of a super-civilization which had been viewing\ndevelopments on this planet with misgivings. It was thought this other\ncivilization had advanced greatly beyond Earth's and that the problems\nbesetting us--social, economic, scientific--had been solved by the\nsuper-civilization. Obviously, then, Dameri Tass had come, an advisor\nfrom a benevolent and friendly people, to guide the world aright.\n\nAnd nine-tenths of the population of Earth stood ready and willing to be\nguided. The other tenth liked things as they were and were quite\nconvinced that the space envoy would upset their applecarts.\n\n\n\nViljalmar Andersen, Secretary-General of the U.N., was to introduce the\nspace emissary. \"Can you give me an idea at all of what he is like?\" he\nasked nervously.\n\nPresident McCord was as upset as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation. \"I\nknow almost as little as you do.\"\n\nSir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But my dear chap, you've had him for\nalmost two weeks. Certainly in that time--\"\n\nThe President snapped back, \"You probably won't believe this, but he's\nbeen asleep until yesterday. When he first arrived he told us he hadn't\nslept for a _decal_, whatever that is; so we held off our discussion\nwith him until morning. Well--he didn't awaken in the morning, nor the\nnext. Six days later, fearing something was wrong we woke him.\"\n\n\"What happened?\" Sir Alfred asked.\n\nThe President showed embarrassment. \"He used some rather ripe Irish\nprofanity on us, rolled over, and went back to sleep.\"\n\nViljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well, what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\"We actually haven't had time to question him. Among other things,\nthere's been some controversy about whose jurisdiction he comes under.\nThe State Department claims the Army shouldn't--\"\n\nThe Secretary General sighed deeply. \"Just what _did_ he do?\"\n\n\"The Secret Service reports he spent the day whistling Mother Machree\nand playing with his dog, cat and mouse.\"\n\n\"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\" blurted Sir Alfred.\n\nThe President was defensive. \"He had to have some occupation, and he\nseems to be particularly interested in our animal life. He wanted a\nhorse but compromised for the others. I understand he insists all three\nof them come with him wherever he goes.\"\n\n\"I wish we knew what he was going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\nSurrounded by F.B.I. men, Dameri Tass was ushered to the speaker's\nstand. He had a kitten in his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\nThe alien frowned worriedly. \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all this be?\nIs it some ordinance I've been after breakin'?\"\n\nMcCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen hastened to reassure him and made him\ncomfortable in a chair.\n\nViljalmar Andersen faced the thousands in the audience and held up his\nhands, but it was ten minutes before he was able to quiet the cheering,\nstamping delegates from all Earth.\n\nFinally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall not take your time for a lengthy\nintroduction of the envoy from the stars. I will only say that, without\ndoubt, this is the most important moment in the history of the human\nrace. We will now hear from the first being to come to Earth from\nanother world.\"\n\nHe turned and gestured to Dameri Tass who hadn't been paying overmuch\nattention to the chairman in view of some dog and cat hostilities that\nhad been developing about his feet.\n\nBut now the alien's purplish face faded to a light blue. He stood and\nsaid hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was that last you said?\"\n\nViljalmar Andersen repeated, \"We will now hear from the first being ever\nto come to Earth from another world.\"\n\nThe face of the alien went a lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't jist\nbe frightenin' a body, would ye? You don't mean to tell me this planet\nisn't after bein' a member of the Galactic League?\"\n\nAndersen's face was blank. \"Galactic League?\"\n\n\"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass moaned. \"I've gone and put me foot in it\nagain. I'll be after getting _kert_ for this.\"\n\nSir Alfred was on his feet. \"I don't understand! Do you mean you aren't\nan envoy from another planet?\"\n\nDameri Tass held his head in his hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's\nsayin', and meself only a second-rate collector of specimens for the\nCarthis zoo.\"\n\nHe straightened and started off the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I must\nblast off immediately.\"\n\nThings were moving fast for President McCord but already an edge of\nrelief was manifesting itself. Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of\ncourse, of course, if that is your desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard\nwho had accompanied the alien to the assemblage.\n\nA dull roar was beginning to emanate from the thousands gathered in the\ntremendous hall, murmuring, questioning, disbelieving.\n\n\n\nViljalmar Andersen felt that he must say something. He extended a\ndetaining hand. \"Now you are here,\" he said urgently, \"even though by\nmistake, before you go can't you give us some brief word? Our world is\nin chaos. Many of us have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\nDameri Tass shook off the restraining hand. \"Do I look daft? Begorry, I\nshould have been a-knowin' something was queer. All your weapons and\nyour strange ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised if ye hadn't yet\nestablished a planet-wide government. Sure, an' I'll go still further.\nYe probably still have wars on this benighted world. No wonder it is ye\nhaven't been invited to join the Galactic League an' take your place\namong the civilized planets.\"\n\nHe hustled from the rostrum and made his way, still surrounded by\nguards, to the door by which he had entered. The dog and the cat trotted\nafter, undismayed by the furor about them.\n\nThey arrived about four hours later at the field on which he'd landed,\nand the alien from space hurried toward his craft, still muttering. He'd\nbeen accompanied by a general and by the President, but all the way he\nhad refrained from speaking.\n\nHe scurried from the car and toward the spacecraft.\n\nPresident McCord said, \"You've forgotten your pets. We would be glad if\nyou would accept them as--\"\n\nThe alien's face faded a light blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost\nforgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken a crature from this quarantined\nplanet, my name'd be _nork_. Keep your dog and your kitty.\" He shook his\nhead sadly and extracted a mouse from a pocket. \"An' this amazin' little\ncrature as well.\"\n\nThey followed him to the spacecraft. Just before entering, he spotted\nthe bedraggled horse that had been present on his landing.\n\nA longing expression came over his highly colored face. \"Jist one\nthing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were they pullin' my leg when they said you\nwere after ridin' on the back of those things?\"\n\nThe President looked at the woebegone nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,\nsurprised. \"Man has been riding them for centuries.\"\n\nDameri Tass shook his head. \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my makin' if I\ncould've taken one back to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\nThe others drew back, out of range of the expected blast, and watched,\neach with his own thoughts, as the first visitor from space hurriedly\nleft Earth.\n\n\n                                                           ... THE END\n\n",
