When F.\nR. Leavis calls Andrew Lang \"a scholar and a man of taste, with a\nfeeling for language and a desire to write poetry,\"[1] it is clear that\nfor Leavis these attributes disqualify Lang from being taken seriously\nas a poet. But for the age of Pope, \"taste\" was a key term in its\naesthetic thinking; the meaning and application of the term was a\nlively issue which engaged most of the ablest minds of the period.\n\nAddison prefaced his series of Spectator papers on the \"Pleasures of\nthe Imagination\" with a ground-clearing essay on \"taste\" (No. 409). In\nthis classic account of the term, Addison defines \"taste\" as \"that\nFaculty of the Soul, which discerns the Beauties of an Author with\nPleasure, and the Imperfections with Dislike.\" Addison's \"taste\" is an\ninnate proclivity towards certain kinds of aesthetic experience that\nhas been consciously cultivated in the approved direction. It is not\nenough to value and enjoy the right authors; they must be valued and\nenjoyed for the right reasons. When he holds up to ridicule the man who\nassured him that \"the greatest Pleasure he took in reading Virgil, was\nin examining Aeneas his Voyage by the Map,\" Addison clearly expects his\nreaders to agree that such a singular taste was in fact no taste at\nall. His account implies not only a standard of \"taste,\" but also\ngeneral agreement, at least among \"men of taste,\" about what the\nstandard was. It is this circularity that makes it essential to assume\nsome innate faculty of \"taste.\"\n\nBut Addison's prescription for the cultivation of taste was a\nlaborious one, involving prolonged reading and study. The wealthy, and\nespecially the newly wealthy, were tempted to confuse the correct\nappreciation of the objects of taste with the mere possession of them;\nso that, as with Pope's Timon in the _Epistle to Burlington_ (1731),\nowning a library became a substitute for reading books. This false\ntaste for ostentation--especially in buildings--is a frequent target\nof contemporary satire.\n\nThe social importance of \"taste\" as an index of wealth was reinforced\nby current philosophical thinking that gave \"taste\" a moral dimension\ntoo. In his _Characteristicks_ (1711), Shaftesbury postulated an innate\nmoral sense, just as Addison did an innate aesthetic sense. Shaftesbury\ndraws this analogy between the moral and the aesthetic:\n\n    The Case is the same here [in the mental or moral Subjects], as in\n    the ordinary Bodys, or common Subjects of Sense. The Shapes,\n    Motions, Colours, and Proportions of these being presented to our\n    Eye; there necessarily results a Beauty or Deformity, according to\n    the different Measure, Arrangement and Disposition of their several\n    Parts. So in _Behaviour_ and _Actions_, when presented to our\n    Understanding, there must be found, of necessity, an apparent\n    Difference, according to the Regularity or Irregularity of the\n    Subjects.[2]\n\nThe correct training of this capacity would enable men to make the\nright choices in both moral and aesthetic matters. This analogy is also\nthe basis of Francis Hutcheson's _Essay on the Nature and Conduct of\nthe Passions and Affections_ (1728).\n\nIt is against the philosophical background of the writings of Addison,\nShaftesbury, and Hutcheson that the satire on \"taste\" of Pope,\nBramston, and others must be seen. But by the time Pope wrote his\n_Epistle to Burlington_, Addison's \"Faculty of the Soul\" had been\nsomewhat debased as a critical term, and the decline of \"taste\" was a\ncommon topic. \"Nothing is so common as the affectation of, nor any\nthing so seldom found as Taste\" was the complaint of the _Weekly\nRegister_ in 1731, deploring \"the degeneracy of _Taste_ since Mr.\n_Addison's_ time.\"[3]\n\nThe publication of Pope's _Epistle to Burlington_ in December 1731 was\na literary event of some importance, especially since it was his first\npoem since the _Dunciad Variorum_ of 1729. The _Epistle_ gave \"taste\" a\nrenewed currency as a vogue word. \"Of Taste\" is found only on the\nhalf-title of the first edition. But, significantly changed to \"Of\nFalse Taste\" for the second edition, this designation found its way\nonto the title-page of the third edition, and became the poem's popular\ntitle (it is so described on the advertisement leaf of Bramston's _The\nMan of Taste_).\n\nSeveral attacks on Pope and his poem were published in the following\nyear or so. _A Miscellany on Taste_ (1732) reprinted Pope's _Epistle_\nwith combative critical notes. Pope himself was attacked, as \"Mr.\nAlexander Taste,\" in an anonymous pamphlet _Mr. Taste the Poetical Fop_\n(1732), reissued in 1733 as _The Man of Taste_, apparently borrowing\nthe title of Bramston's poem.[4] Bramston's _The Man of Taste_ (1733)\nis an early example of the more positive reaction to Pope's _Epistle_,\njoining him rather than attempting to beat him. Bramston's poem in its\nturn occasioned an anonymous _The Woman of Taste_ (1733), and suggested\nsome details for the character of Lord Apemode in James Miller's comedy\n_The Man of Taste_ (1735). Pope himself borrowed an idea from it (see\np. 14, 11. 5-6) for a passage in the _Dunciad_ (the allusion to\nFree-Masons and F.R.S.; IV, 567-71).\n\nThe cluster of works provoked by Pope's _Epistle_ is evidence of the\ntopicality of \"taste\" at the time Bramston wrote his poem, and it is\nhis _Man of Taste_ that retains most interest today. The later history\nof \"taste\" in eighteenth-century aesthetics and satire can only briefly\nbe glanced at here. Important philosophical discussions are Hume's\nessay \"Of the Standard of Taste\" (in Four Dissertations, 1757), Burke's\n_Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and\nBeautiful_ (1757; a \"Discourse Concerning Taste\" was prefaced to the\nsecond edition, 1759), and Alexander Gerard's _Essay on Taste_ (1759).\nFoote's farce _Taste_ (1752) exposed the sham taste for the antique.\nThere are numerous satiric portraits of the \"Man of Taste\": Mr.\nSterling in _The Clandestine Marriage_ (1766) is a good example clearly\nin the tradition of Pope's Timon, as is General Tilney in _Northanger\nAbbey_ (1818, but written much earlier).\n\nBy the time of Jane Austen, of course, \"taste\" had developed away from\nthe Addisonian rules, and indeed the whole tenor of the aesthetics of\nthe imagination had changed. What had happened can be suggested by\njuxtaposing two significant statements about \"taste\" as metaphor. In\nhis _Spectator_ essay (No. 409) Addison speaks of \"a very great\nConformity between that Mental Taste, which is the Subject of this\nPaper, and that Sensitive Taste which gives us a Relish of every\ndifferent Flavour that affects the Palate.\" But in the Preface to\n_Lyrical Ballads_ (1802), Wordsworth deprecates those \"who will\nconverse with us as gravely about a _taste_ for Poetry, as they express\nit, as if it were a thing indifferent as a taste for Rope-dancing, or\nFrontiniac or Sherry.\"[5] But the breakdown of the metaphor of \"taste\"\nis too large a subject to be explored here.\n\n                 *       *       *       *       *\n\nJames Bramston (?1694-1743) was educated at Westminster School and at\nChrist Church, Oxford, where he took his B.A. in 1717 and his M.A. in\n1720. He took orders, and was for a time a military chaplain. In 1724\nhe obtained the living of Lurgashall, and in 1739 those of Harting and\nWesthampnett.[6] He published (all anonymously) only three poems in\nEnglish:\n\n    1. _The Art of Politicks, in Imitation of Horace's Art of Poetry._\n    London: Lawton Gilliver, 1729.\n\n    2. _The Man of Taste. Occasion'd by an Epistle of Mr. Pope's on\n    that Subject._ London: Lawton Gilliver, 1733.\n\n    3. _The Crooked Six-pence. With a Learned Preface Found among Some\n    Papers Bearing Date the Same Year in which Paradise Lost Was\n    Published by the Late Dr. Bently._ London: Robert Dodsley, 1743.\n\nBramston also wrote Latin verses, and at least two unpublished poems\nsurvive; but his reputation rests on _The Art of Politicks_ and _The\nMan of Taste_. Both poems are of interest to the political and cultural\nhistorian, but from a literary point of view _The Man of Taste_ is\nprobably the better poem. This is largely because of Bramston's success\nin creating the persona of a self-consciously affected Man of Taste,\nwho, however, exposes himself more than he intends. Joseph Warton\nmistook this effect for a failure of technique when he called Bramston\n\"guilty of the indecorum and absurdity of making his hero laugh at\nhimself and his own follies.\"[7] The poem is deliberately the\n\"confessions\" of a self-styled Man of Taste. It begins in a casual,\ncynical tone, but as the speaker is gradually seduced by his own\nrhetoric (especially when he imagines himself a nobleman) he strikes an\nalmost rhapsodic note, so that he is revealed as the victim, not the\nexploiter, of \"taste.\"\n\nBoth in his targets and his techniques, Bramston is a disciple of Pope.\nSometimes there is a conscious recollection of the master:\n\n    I squal'd in Distichs, and in Triplets wept. (p. 6)\n\nElsewhere the imitation is less happy:\n\n    Sure wretched _Wren_ was taught by bungling _Jones_,\n    To murder mortar, and disfigure stones! (p. 10)\n\nHere the stylistic habit of antithesis works against the meaning\ninstead of reinforcing it. But there are many good things in the poem;\nBramston's treatment of the idea of the stage as a \"school of\nmorality,\" for example, is clever and amusing. His hero derives his\n\"Hereditary Taste\" from being \"tragi-comically got\" by a player-poet\nand an orange-woman (p. 6). This gives point to his later claim:\n\n    _Oxford_ and _Cambridge_ are not worth one farthing,\n    Compar'd to _Haymarket_, and _Convent-garden_:\n    Quit those, ye British Youth, and follow these,\n    Turn players all, and take your Squires degrees. (p. 18)\n\nThere are also a number of verbal successes, such as:\n\n    Nor barb'rous birch e'er brush'd my brawny bum. (p. 6)\n\nHere insistent alliteration and strong rhythm are combined to excellent\nonomatopoeic effect. Another couplet:\n\n    Tho' _Blackmore's_ works my soul with raptures fill,\n    With notes by _Bently_ they'd be better still. (p. 7)\n\nshows considerable appreciation of the Art of Sinking; the second line\nespecially is fine bathos.\n\nThe poem as a whole provides an interesting portrait of contemporary\nfashionable \"taste\" that supplements, at a lower social level, Pope's\nportraits of such magnates of tastelessness as Timon. Bramston's Man of\nTaste is an odd amalgam of the singular and the trite. He begins by\nprofessing to despise laws, and ends by attempting to enact his own.\nIn drawing a character whose tastes are at one moment shamelessly\nperverse, at another servilely imitative, and in depicting a wide range\nof \"tastes,\" Bramston has developed significantly the idea that he took\nfrom the _Epistle to Burlington_, which is largely concerned with false\ntaste in building.\n\nThis is not to deny that most of the victims of Bramston's satire are\nsomewhere Pope's too. At times one even begins to suspect that\nBramston's knowledge of London derives as much from the _Dunciad\nVariorum_ as from first-hand experience of the city. There is certainly\na strong traditional element in some of his themes. The ironic praise\nof Sir Cloudesley Shovell's tomb, for example (p. 12), was probably\nsuggested by the _Spectator_ (No. 26) rather than a visit to\nWestminster Abbey; the tomb had offended Addison because it portrayed\nthe admiral in an alien character.\n\nBut the traditional is combined with the topical. If Sir Cloudesley's\ntomb had been a butt for twenty years, Sir Balaam is an allusion to\nPope's _Epistle to Bathurst_, only published in February, 1733, the\nmonth before the _Man of Taste_. Further evidence that Bramston was\nmaking additions to the poem as late as February 1733 (the poem was\npublished on 8 March) are the lines:\n\n    Not so my mind, unsatisfied with hints,\n    Knows more than _Budgel_ writes, or _Roberts_ prints. (p. 10)\n\nThese lines hit at a new readers' digest, _The Bee: or, Universal\nWeekly Pamphlet. Containing Something to Hit Every Man's Taste and\nPrinciples_, which was edited by Budgell and published by Roberts. The\nfirst number came out in February 1733. There is a similar mixture of\npast and current with the musical satire (p. 13). Handel's _Esther_ and\nthe novelty of oratorio were as recent as 1732; Heidegger's ugliness\n(\"Prince _Phyz_!\") was proverbial, and his renaming of the masquerade a\ndecade old.\n\nThis mixture is confusing, but certainly intentional, since it would\nhave made the _Man of Taste_ more ridiculous to a contemporary\naudience. There is also a vertical mixture of the tastes of different\nlevels of society; the writer in the _Weekly Register_ for February\n1731, already quoted above, makes this distinction: \"The gaming-table,\nand the royal diversion at _Newmarket_, are the ambition of the\nmajority; and the rest prefer _Senesino_ to _Shakespear_, as the\nhighest proof of modern politeness.\"[8] Bramston's Man of Taste is a\nconcertina-brow, enjoying Senesino, gaming, and Newmarket (pp. 13, 15,\n17).\n\nThe usefulness of notes for a full understanding of Bramston's satire\nwas recognized as early as 1733, when a few were added to Faulkner's\nDublin reprint. Faulkner's notes are remarkable for their xenophobic\nbias, for apart from those on Mrs. Oldfield (\"_Ophelia_,\" p. 9), they\nmostly call attention to evils of continental origin: Pasaran's\nrecommendation of suicide (p. 9); Heidegger's role as corrupting\nentertainer (p. 13); the imposter Count D'Ughi (the \"_Di'mond Count_,\"\np. 16); and Misaubin (p. 17), \"famous for curing the venereal\nDisorders.\" These men were Italian, Swiss, Italian, and French\nrespectively. This xenophobia is a remarkably constant feature of\neighteenth-century satire on \"taste.\"\n\n_The Man of Taste_ (together with _The Art of Politicks_) was included\nin Dodsley's _Collection_; in the 1782 edition, notes (unsigned, but by\nIsaac Reed) were added, identifying many allusions which no longer\npassed current. These are often helpful, but sometimes miss the\npoint--as they do with the Budgell-Roberts joke, discussed above. But\nalthough notes are useful for a complete understanding of all\nBramston's satiric points, a familiarity with the world of Pope and his\nvictims removes most of the difficulties for a modern reader. Only\noccasionally does Bramston sound a more personal note, as in the list\nof doctors (p. 17), where he includes two of his contemporaries at\nChrist Church; and even here, Arbuthnot is a sufficient signpost.\n\nBramston is a minor poet, but there is no need to apologize for\n_The Man of Taste_. It is a lively and amusing poem in its own right,\nand its association with Pope and its place in the corpus of\neighteenth-century satire on \"taste\" raise its claim to the attention\nof students of the period.\n\nUniversity of Queensland\nBrisbane\n\n\n\n\nNOTES TO THE INTRODUCTION\n\n\n1. _New Bearings in English Poetry_ (1932; new ed., London: Chatto &\nWindus, 1950), p. 11.\n\n2.

Pindarick parents matter'd not,\n  So I was tragi-comically got.\n  My infant tears a sort of measure kept,\n  I squal'd in Distichs, and in Triplets wept.\n  No youth did in I education waste,\n  Happy in an _Hereditary Taste_.\n  Writing ne'er cramp'd the sinews of my thumb,\n  Nor barb'rous birch e'er brush'd my brawny bum.\n  My guts ne'er suffer'd from a college-cook,\n  My name ne'er

Dome,\n  Which _having finish'd_, we set out for _Rome_;\n  Take a weeks view of _Venice_ and the _Brent_,\n  Stare round, see nothing, and come home content.\n  I'll have my _Villa_ too, a sweet abode,\n  Its situation shall be _London_ road:\n  _Pots_ o'er the door I'll place like Cits balconies,\n  Which[1] _Bently_ calls the _Gardens of Adonis_.\n    I'll have my Gardens in the fashion too,\n  For what is beautiful that is not new?\n  Fair four-legg'd temples, theatres that vye,\n  With all the angles of a _Christmas_-pye.\n  Does it not merit the beholder's praise,\n  What's high to sink? and what is low to raise?\n  Slopes shall ascend where once a green-house stood,\n  And in my horse-pond I will plant a wood.\n  Let misers dread the hoarded gold to waste,\n  Expence and alteration shew a _Taste_.\n    In curious paintings I'm exceeding nice,\n  And know their several beauties by their _Price_.\n  _Auctions_ and _Sales_ I constantly attend,\n  But chuse my pictures by a _skilful friend_.\n  Originals and copies much the same,\n  The picture's value is the _painter's name_.\n    My taste in Sculpture from my choice is seen,\n  I buy no statues that are not obscene.\n  In spite of _Addison_ and ancient _Rome_,\n  Sir _Cloudesly Shovel_'s is my fav'rite tomb.\n  How oft have I with admiration stood,\n  To view some City-magistrate in wood?\n  I gaze with pleasure on a Lord May'r's head,\n  Cast with propriety in gilded lead.\n  Oh could I view through _London_ as I pass,\n  Some broad Sir _Balaam_ in _Corinthian_ brass;\n  High on a pedestal, ye Freemen, place\n  His magisterial Paunch and griping Face;\n  _Letter'd and Gilt_, let him adorn _Cheapside_,\n  And grant the _Tradesman_, what a _King_'s deny'd.\n    Old Coins and Medals I collect, 'tis true,\n  Sir _Andrew_ has 'em, and I'll have 'em too.\n  But among friends if I the truth might speak,\n  I like the modern, and despise th' antique.\n  Tho' in the draw'rs of my japan _Bureau_,\n  To Lady _Gripeall_ I the _Caesars_ shew,\n  'Tis equal to her Ladyship or me,\n  A copper _Otho_, or a _Scotch Baubee_.\n    Without _Italian_, or without an ear,\n  To _Bononcini_'s musick I adhere:\n  Musick has charms to sooth a savage beast,\n  And therefore proper at a Sheriff's feast.\n  My soul has oft a secret pleasure found,\n  In the harmonious Bagpipe's lofty sound.\n  Bagpipes for men, shrill _German-flutes_ for boys,\n  I'm _English_ born, and love a grumbling noise.\n  The Stage should yield the solemn Organ's note,\n  And Scripture tremble in the Eunuch's throat.\n  Let _Senesino_ sing, what _David_ writ,\n  And _Hallelujahs_ charm the pious pit.\n  Eager in throngs the town to _Hester_ came,\n  And _Oratorio_ was a lucky name.\n  Thou, _Heeideggre!_ the _English_ taste has found,\n  And rul'st the mob of quality with sound.\n  In _Lent_, if Masquerades displease the town,\n  Call 'em _Ridotto_'s, and they still go down:\n  Go on, Prince _Phyz_! to please the British nation,\n  Call thy next _Masquerade_ a _Convocation_.\n    Bears, Lyons, Wolves, and Elephants I breed,\n  And _Philosophical Transactions_ read.\n  Next Lodge I'll be _Free-Mason_, nothing less,\n  Unless I happen to be _F.R.S._\n    I have a _Palate_, and (as yet) _two Ears_,\n  Fit company for _Porters_, or for _Peers_.\n  Of ev'ry useful knowledge I've a share,\n  But my top talent is a bill of fare.\n  Sir Loins and rumps of beef offend my eyes,\n  Pleas'd with frogs fricasseed, and coxcomb-pies.\n  Dishes I chuse though little, yet genteel,\n  _Snails_ the first course, and _Peepers_ crown the meal.\n  Pigs heads with hair on, much my fancy please,\n  I love young colly-flow'rs if stew'd in cheese,\n  And give ten guineas for a pint of peas.\n  No tatling servants to my table come,\n  My Grace is _Silence_, and my waiter _Dumb_.\n  Queer Country-puts extol Queen _Bess_'s reign,\n  And of lost hospitality complain.\n  Say thou that do'st thy father's table praise,\n  Was there _Mahogena_ in former days?\n    Oh! could a British Barony be sold!\n  I would bright honour buy with dazling gold.\n  Could I the _privilege_ of _Peer_ procure,\n  The rich I'd bully, and oppress the poor.\n  To _give_ is wrong, but it is wronger still,\n  On any terms to _pay_ a tradesman's bill.\n  I'd make the insolent Mechanicks stay,\n  And keep my ready money all for _play_.\n  I'd try if any pleasure could be found,\n  In _tossing-up_ for twenty thousand pound.\n  Had I whole Counties, I to _White_'s would go,\n  And set lands, woods, and rivers, at a throw.\n  But should I meet with an unlucky run,\n  And at a throw be gloriously undone;\n  My _debts of honour_ I'd discharge the first,\n  Let all my _lawful creditors_ be curst:\n  My _Title_ would preserve me from arrest,\n  And seising _hired horses_ is a jest.\n  I'd walk the mornings with an _oaken stick_,\n  With gloves and hat, like my own _footman, Dick_.\n  A footman I wou'd be, in outward show,\n  In sense, and education, _truly so_.\n  As for my _head_, it should ambiguous wear\n  _At once_ a periwig, _and_ its own hair.\n  My hair I'd powder in the women's way,\n  And _dress_, and _talk of dressing_, more than they.\n  I'll please the maids of honour, if I can;\n  Without black-velvet-britches, what is man?\n  I will my skill in _button-holes_ display,\n  And brag how oft I shift me ev'ry day.\n  Shall I wear cloaths, in _awkward England_ made?\n  And sweat in cloth, to help the _woollen trade_?\n  In _French_ embroid'ry and in _Flanders_ lace\n  I'll spend the income of a treasurer's place.\n  _Deard_'s bill for baubles shall to thousands mount,\n  And I'd out-di'mond ev'n the _Di'mond Count_.\n  I would convince the world by taudry cloa's,\n  That _Belles_ are less effeminate than beaux,\n  And Doctor _Lamb_ should pare my Lordship's toes.\n    To boon companions I my time would give,\n  With players, pimps, and parasites I'd live.\n  I would with _Jockeys_ from _Newmarket_ dine,\n  And to _Rough-riders_ give my choicest wine.\n  I would caress some _Stableman_ of note,\n  And imitate his language, and his _coat_.\n  My ev'nings all I would with _sharpers_ spend,\n  And make the _Thief-catcher_ my bosom friend.\n  In _Fig_ the Prize-fighter by day delight,\n  And sup with _Colly Cibber_ ev'ry night.\n    Should I perchance be fashionably ill,\n  I'd send for _Misaubin_, and take his pill.\n  I should abhor, though in the utmost need,\n  _Arbuthnot_, _Hollins_, _Wigan_, _Lee_, or _Mead_:\n  But if I found that I grew worse and worse,\n  I'd turn off _Misaubin_ and take a Nurse.\n  How oft, when eminent physicians fail,\n  Do good old womens remedies prevail?\n  When beauty's gone, and _Chloe_'s struck with years,\n  Eyes she can couch, or she can syringe ears.\n  Of Graduates I dislike the learned rout,\n  And chuse a _female Doctor_ for the gout.\n    Thus would I live, with no dull _pedants_ curs'd,\n  Sure, of all blockheads, _Scholars_ are the worst.\n  Back to your _Universitys_, ye fools,\n  And dangle Arguments on strings in schools:\n  Those schools which _Universitys_ they call,\n  'Twere well for _England_ were there none at all.\n  With ease that loss the nation might sustain,\n  Supply'd by _Goodman's Fields_ and _Drury-lane_.\n  _Oxford_ and _Cambridge_ are not worth one farthing,\n  Compar'd to _Haymarket_, and _Convent-garden_:\n  Quit those, ye British Youth, and follow these,\n  Turn players all, and take your 'Squires degrees.\n  Boast not your incomes now, as heretofore,\n  Ye book-learn'd Seats! the Theatres have more:\n  Ye stiff-rump'd heads of Colleges be dumb,\n  A singing Eunuch gets a larger Sum.\n  Have some of you three hundred by the Year,\n  _Booth_, _Rich_, and _Cibber_, twice three thousand clear.\n  Should _Oxford_ to her sister _Cambridge_ join\n  A Year's _Rack-rent_, and _Arbitrary fine_:\n  Thence not one winter's charge would be defray'd,\n  For Playhouse, Opera, Ball, and Masquerade.\n  Glad I congratulate the judging Age,\n  The players are the world, the world the stage.\n    I am a Politician too, and hate\n  Of any party, ministers of state:\n  I'm for an _Act_, that he, who sev'n whole Years\n  Has serv'd his _King_ and _Country_, lose his ears.\n    Thus from my birth I'm qualified you find,\n  To give the laws of _Taste_ to humane kind.\n  Mine are the gallant Schemes of Politesse,\n  For books, and buildings, politicks, and dress.\n  This is _True Taste_, and whoso likes it not,\n  Is blockhead, coxcomb, puppy, fool, and sot.\n\n      [1] Bently's Milton, Book 9.
