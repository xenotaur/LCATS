    "body": "Before the first shots rang out, Alan had been sitting with some twenty\nyoung people of the Wolf clan in a grove of aspen approximately half\nway between the fields and the citadel on the hill-top. He had been\nteaching them myth-legend and, as usual, the girls were bored and\nunbelieving, the boys open mouthed.\n\nHe realized, even as he spoke, that the telling had changed even\nsince his own youth. As a boy of ten, before it was definitely known\nwhether or not he was a sterilie, he had sat at the feet of the Turtle\nclan's husband as open mouthed as those who sat at his feet now. But\nthe telling was different. Now, had he spoken openly of when men bore\nweapons and women lived at home with the children, he would have\ncrossed the boundaries of decency. It hadn't been so in his own youth,\nbut then, when he was a boy, they had been one generation nearer to\nthe old days, which weren't so far back after all.\n\nHelen complained, \"This is so silly, Alan. Why don't you tell us\nsomething about ... well, about hunting, or true fighting?\"\n\nHe looked at her. Could this be a daughter of his? Tall for her\nfourteen years and straight, clear of eye, aggressive and brooking of\nno nonsense. The old books told of the femininity of women, but....\n\nThe shots went _bang, bang, bang_, from below, faint in the half mile\nor more of distance. And then _bang, bang_ again and several _booms_\nfrom the new muzzle loading muskets.\n\nHelen was on her feet first, her eyes flashing. Instantly she was in\ncommand. \"Alan,\" she snapped. \"Quick, to the citadel. All of you boys,\nhurry! To the citadel!\"\n\nShe whirled to her older classmates. \"Ruth, Margo, Jenny, Paula. Get\nstones, sharp stones. You younger girls go with Alan. See if you can\nhelp at the citadel. We'll come last. Hurry Alan.\"\n\nAlan was already off, herding the boys before him. Possibly all of them\nwere sterilies and so wouldn't count. But you never knew.\n\nAs they climbed the hill, he looked back over his shoulder. Down in the\nfields he could see the workers scattering for their weapons and for\ncover. One stumbled and was down. In the distance he couldn't make out\nwhether she had fallen accidentally or been wounded. Further beyond the\nfields he could see the smoke from a half dozen or more places where\nthe shots had originated. It didn't seem to be an attack in force.\n\nNot far up the hill from the field workers, on a overhanging boulder in\na lookout position, he could make out Vivian, the scout chief. She sat,\nseemingly in unconcerned ease, one elbow supported on a knee as her\ntelescoped rifle went _crack, crack, crack_. If he knew Vivian there\nwas more than one casualty among the raiders.\n\nWho could it be this time? Deer from the south, Coyote or Horse from\nthe east? Possibly Eagles, Crows or Dogs from Denver way. The clan\ncouldn't stand much more of this pressure. It was the third raid in six\nmonths. They couldn't stand it and put in a crop, nor could the drain\non the arsenal be maintained. He had heard that the Turtle clan, near\nColorado Springs, the clan of his birth, had got to the point where\nthey were using bows and arrows even for defense. If so, it wouldn't be\nlong before they would be losing their husband.\n\nHe was puffing somewhat by the time they reached the citadel. Helen\nand her four girls were coming much more slowly, watching the progress\nof the fight below them, keeping their eyes peeled for a possible\nbreak through of individual enemies. The stones in their hands were\npathetically brave.\n\nThe rounded citadel building, stone built, loopholed for rifles, loomed\nbefore them. He swung open the door and hurried inside.\n\n\"Hello, honey,\" a strange voice said pseudo-pleasantly. \"Hey, you're\nkind of cute.\"\n\nAlan's eyes went from the two figures before him, automatic rifles\ncuddled under their arms, to the two Wolf clan sentries collapsed in\ntheir own blood on the floor. They had paid for lack of vigilance with\ntheir lives.\n\nHe could see that the strangers were of different clans by their kilts,\none a Horse the other a Crow. This would mean two clans had united in\norder to raid the Wolves and that, in turn, would mean the Wolves were\noutnumbered as much as two to one.\n\n\"Relax, darling,\" the second one said, a lewd quality in her voice.\n\"Nothing's going to happen to _you_.\" Her eyes took in the dozen boys\nranging in age from five to twelve. \"Look like a bunch of sterilies to\nme,\" she sneered. \"Get them up above, and those girls too. You stay\nhere where we can watch you, honey.\"\n\nThe Crow went to a small window, stared down below. \"Wanda is holding\nthem pretty well but they're beginning to work their way back in this\ndirection.\" She laughed harshly. \"These Wolves never could fight.\"\n\nHer companion fingered the Bren gun which lay on the heavy table top in\nthe round room's center. Aside from four equally heavily constructed\nchairs the table was the large room's sole furniture. While Alan was\nushering the boys and younger girls up to the second floor where they\nwould be safe, the Horse said musingly, \"We could turn this loose on\nthem even at this distance.\"\n\nThe Crow shook her head. \"No. It'll be better to wait until they're\ncloser. Besides, by that time Peggy and her group'll be coming up from\nthe arroyo. There won't be a Wolf left half an hour from now.\"\n\nAlan, his stomach empty, stared out the loophole nearest him.\n\nOne of the women said, grinning, \"You better get away from there,\nhoney. Make you sick. That's a mighty pretty suit you've got on. Make\nit yourself?\"\n\n\"No,\" Alan said. As a matter of fact one of the sterilies had made it.\n\nShe laughed. \"Well, don't be so uppity. You're going to have to learn\nhow to be nice to me, you know.\"\n\nBoth of them laughed, but Alan said nothing. He wondered how long the\nwomen of these clans had been without a husband.\n\nDown below he could make out the progress of the fighting and then\nrealized the battle plan of the aggressors. They must have planned it\nfor months, waiting until the season was such that practically the\nwhole Wolf clan, and particularly the fighters, would be at work in the\nfields. They'd sent these two scouts, probably their best warriors, to\ntake the citadel by stealth. Only two of them, more would have been\nconspicuous.\n\nThey had then, with a limited force, opened fire on the field workers,\npinning them down temporarily.\n\nMeanwhile, the main body was ascending the arroyo to the left,\ncompletely hidden from the defending forces although they would have\nbeen in open sight from above had the citadel remained uncaptured.\n\nAlan could see plainly what the next fifteen minutes would mean. The\nWolf clan would draw back on the citadel, Vivian and her younger\nwarriors bringing up the rear. When they broke into the clear and\nstarted the last dash for the safety of their fortress, they would be\nin the open and at the mercy of the crossfire from arroyo and citadel.\n\nIf only these two had failed in their attempt to....\n\nThe Crow woman said, \"Look at this. Five young brats with stones in\ntheir hands. What do you say?\"\n\nIt was Helen and her four girls.\n\nAlan said, \"They're only children! You can't....\"\n\n\"You be quiet, sweetheart. We can't be bothered with you.\"\n\nThe Horse said, \"Two years from now they'll all be warriors. Here, let\nme turn this on them.\"\n\nAlan closed his eyes and he wanted to retch as he heard the automatic\nrifle speak out in five short bursts. In spite of himself he opened\nthem again. Helen, his first born, Paula, his second. Ruth, Margo and\nJenny, all his children. They were crumbled like rag dolls, fifty feet\nfrom the citadel door.\n\nNow he was able to tell himself that he should have called out a\nwarning. One or two of them, at least, might have escaped. Might have\nescaped to warn the approaching fighters of the trap behind them.\nTradition had been too strong within him, the tradition that a man did\nnot interfere in the business of the warriors, that war was a thing\napart.\n\nJenny's body moved, stirred again, and she tried to drag herself away.\nLittle Jenny, twelve years old. The rifle spat just once again and she\nslumped forward and remained quiet.\n\n\"Little bitch,\" the Crow woman said.\n\nThe heavy chair was in his hands and high above his head, he had\nbrought it down on her before the rage of his hate had allowed him to\nthink of what he was doing. The chair splintered but there was still\na good half of it in his hands when he spun on the Horse woman. She\nstepped back, her eyes wide in disbelief. As her companion went down,\nthe side of her face and her scalp welling blood, the Horse at first\nbrought up her rifle and then, in despair, tried to reverse it to use\nits butt as a club.\n\nShe was stumbling backward, trying to get out of the way of his\nimprovised weapon, when her heel caught on the body of one of the\nfallen Wolf sentries. She tried to catch herself, her eyes still\nstaring horrified disbelief, even as he caught her over the head, and\nthen once again. He beat her, beat her hysterically, until he knew she\nmust be dead.\n\nHe worked now in a mental vacuum, all but unconsciously. He ran to the\nstair bottom and called, \"Come down,\" his voice was shrill. \"Alice,\nTommy, all of you.\"\n\n\n\nThey came, hesitantly, and when they saw the shambles of the room\nstared at him with as much disbelief as had the enemy women. He\npointed a finger at the oldest of the girls. \"Alice,\" he said, \"you've\nbeen given instruction by the warriors. How is the Bren gun fired?\"\n\nThe eleven year old bug eyed at him. \"But you're a husband, Alan....\"\n\n\"How is it fired?\" he shrilled. \"Unless you tell me, there will be no\nWolf clan left!\"\n\nHe lugged the heavy gun to the window, mounted it there as he had seen\nthe women do in practice.\n\n\"Tommy,\" he said to a thirteen year old boy. \"Quick, get me a pan of\nammunition.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" Tommy all but wailed.\n\n\"Get it!\"\n\n\"I can't. It's ... it's _unmanly_!\" Tommy melted into a sea of tears,\nutterly confused.\n\n\"Maureen,\" Alan snapped, cooler now. \"Get me a pan of ammunition for\nthe Bren gun. Quickly. Alice, show me how the gun is charged.\"\n\nAlice was at his side, trying to explain. He would have let her take\nover had she been larger, but he knew she couldn't handle the bucking\nof the weapon. Maureen had returned with the ammunition, slipped\nit expertly into place. She too had had instructions in the gun's\noperation.\n\nAlan ran his eyes down the arroyo. There were possibly forty of them,\nHorses and Crows--well armed, he could see. Less than a quarter of them\nhad the new muzzle loaders being resorted to by many as ammunition\nstocks for the old arms became increasingly rare. The others had\nancient arms, rifles, both military and sport, one or two tommy guns.\n\nHe waited another three or four minutes, one eye cocked on the progress\nof the running battle below. Vivian, the scout chief, had dropped\nback to take over command of the younger warriors. She was probably\nbeginning to smell a rat. The intensity of fire wasn't such as to\nsuggest a large body of enemy.\n\nThe women in the arroyo were placed now as he wanted them. He forced\nhimself to keep his eyes open as he pressed the trigger.\n\n_Blat, blat, blat._\n\nThe gun spoke, kicking high the dust and gravel before the Horse and\nCrow warriors advancing up the arroyo.\n\nThey stopped, startled. The citadel was supposedly in their hands.\n\nThey reversed themselves and scurried back to get out of their exposed\nposition.\n\nHe touched the trigger again. _Blat, blat, blat._ The heavy slugs tore\nup the arroyo wall behind them, they could retreat no further without\nrunning into his fire.\n\nThey stopped, confused.\n\nAlan said, \"Maureen, get another pan of ammunition. I'll have to hold\nthem there until Vivian comes up. Alice, run down to the matriarch and\ntell her about the warriors in the arroyo. Quickly, now.\"\n\nLittle Alice said sourly, \"A husband shouldn't interfere in warrior\naffairs,\" but she went.\n\n\n\nWhen Vivian strode into the citadel she had her sniper rifle slung\nover her back and was admiring a tommy gun she had taken from one of\nthe captured Horses. \"Perfect,\" she said, stroking the stock. \"Perfect\nshape. And they seem to have worlds of ammunition too. Must have made\nsome kind of deal with the Denver clans.\"\n\nHer eyes swept the room and her mouth turned down in sour amusement.\nThe Horse woman was dead and the Crow had by now been marched off to\ntake her place with the other prisoners who were being held in the\nstone corral.\n\n\"What warriors,\" she said contemptuously. \"A _man_ overcomes two of\nthem. _Two_ of them, mind you.\" She looked at Alan, the reaction was\nupon him now and he was white faced and couldn't keep his hands from\ntrembling. \"What a cutie you turned out to be. Who ever heard of such a\nthing?\"\n\nAlan said, defensively, \"They didn't expect it. I took them unawares.\"\n\nVivian laughed aloud, her even white teeth sparkling in the redness of\nher lips. She was tall, shapely, a twenty-five year old goddess in her\nWolf clan kilts. \"I'll bet you did, sweetie.\"\n\nOne of the other warriors entered from behind Vivian, looked at the\ndead Horse woman and shuddered. \"What a way to die, not even able to\ndefend yourself.\" She said to Vivian worriedly, \"They've got an awful\nlot of equipment, chief.\"\n\nVivian said, \"Well, what're you worrying about, Jean? _We_ have it now.\"\n\nThe girl said, \"They have three tommy guns, four automatic rifles,\ntwenty grenades and forty sticks of dynamite.\"\n\nVivian was impatient. \"They had them, now they're ours. It's good, not\nbad.\"\n\nJean said doggedly, \"These raids are coming more and more often. We've\nlost ten fighters in less than a year. And each time they come at us\nthey're better equipped and there're more of them.\" She looked over at\nAlan. \"If it hadn't been for this ... this queer way things worked out,\nthey'd have our husband now and we'd be done for.\"\n\n\"Well, it didn't happen that way,\" Vivian said abruptly, \"and we still\nhave our husband and we're going to keep him. This wasn't a bad action\nat all. They killed three of us, we've got more than forty of them.\"\n\n\"Not three, eight,\" Jean said. \"You forget the five girls. In another\ncouple of years they'd have been warriors. And besides, what difference\ndoes it make if we've got forty of them? There're always more of them\nwhere they came from. There must be a thousand women toward Denver\nwithout a husband between them.\"\n\nVivian quieted. \"Let's hope they don't all decide on Alan at once,\" she\nsaid. \"I wonder if the Turtles are having the same trouble.\"\n\n\"They're having more,\" Alan said. He had lowered himself wearily into\none of the chairs.\n\nThe two warriors looked at him. \"How do you know, sweetie?\" Vivian\nasked him.\n\n\"I was talking to Warren, a few weeks ago. He's husband of the Turtle\nclan now, they traded him from the Foxes. Both clans were getting too\ninterbred....\"\n\n\"Get to the point, honey,\" Jean said, embarrassed at this man talk.\n\n\"The Turtles are having more trouble than we are. They have a stronger\nnatural fortress at the center of their farm lands, but they've had so\nmany raids that their arsenal is depleted and half their warriors dead\nor wounded. They're getting desperate.\"\n\n\"That's too bad,\" Vivian muttered. \"They make good neighbors.\"\n\nJean said, \"The matriarch told me to let you know there'd be a meeting\nthis afternoon in the assembly hall. Clan meeting, all present.\"\n\n\"What about?\" Vivian said, her attention going back to the beauty of\nher captured weapon again.\n\n\"About the prisoners. We've got to decide what to do with them.\"\n\n\"Do with them? We'll push them over the side of the canyon. Nobody\nthought we'd waste bullets on them did they?\"\n\nAlan said, mildly, \"The question has come up whether we ought to\ndestroy them at all.\"\n\nVivian looked at him in gentle annoyance. \"Sweetie,\" she said, \"don't\nbother your handsome head with these things. You've had enough\nexcitement to last a nice looking fellow like you a lifetime.\"\n\nJean said, echoing her chief's disgust, \"Anyway, that's what the\nmeeting is about. Alan, here, has been talking to the matriarch and\nshe's agreed to bring it up for discussion.\"\n\nVivian said nastily, \"Sally is beginning to lose her grip. If there's\nanything a clan needs it's a strong matriarch.\"\n\n\"A wise matriarch,\" Alan amended, knowing he shouldn't.\n\nVivian stared at him for a moment, then threw her head back and\nlaughed. \"I'm going to have to spank your bottom one of these days,\"\nshe told him. \"You get awfully sassy for a man.\"\n\n\n\nAs chairman, Alan had a voice but not a vote in the meetings of the\nWolf clan. He sometimes wondered at the institution which had come\ndown from pre-bomb days. Why was it necessary to have a chair_man_.\nOf course, myth-legend had it that men were once just as numerous and\nactive in society's economic (and even martial!) life as were women.\nBut that was myth-legend. It all had a _basis_ in reality, perhaps, but\nsome of it was undoubtedly stretched all but to the breaking point.\n\nOf course if all men _had_ been fertile in the old days. But if you\nstarted with _if_, as a beginning point, you could go as far as you\nwished in any direction.\n\nHe called the meeting to order in the assembly hall which stood\npossibly a hundred feet below the citadel in one direction, another\nhundred from the stone corral which housed their prisoners, in the\nother. The Wolf clan was present in its entirety with the exception\nof children under ten and except for four scouts who were holding the\nprisoners. As chairman, Alan sat on the dais flanked by Sally, the\nmatriarch, 35 years of age, tall, Junoesque, on one side and by Vivian\nthe scout chief, on the other.\n\nBefore them sat, first, the active warrior-workers, some thirty-five\nof them. Second, the older women, less than a score. Further back\nwere the sterilies, possibly twenty of these and quite young, only\nwithin recent memory had they been allowed to become part of the clan,\nin the past they had been driven away or killed. Further back still\nwere the children above ten but too young to join the ranks of either\nwarrior-workers or sterilies.\n\nAlan called the meeting to order, quieted them somewhat and then\ninvited the matriarch to take the floor.\n\nSally stood and looked out over her clan, the dignity of her presence\nsilencing them where Alan's plea had not.\n\nShe said, \"We have two matters to bring to our attention. First, I\nbelieve the clan should make it clear to Alan, our husband, that such\ninterference in the affairs of women is utterly out of the question. I\nam speaking of his unmanly activities in the raid this morning.\"\n\nThere were mumblings of approval throughout the hall.\n\nAlan came to his feet, his face bewildered. \"But, Sally, what else\ncould I do? If I hadn't overcome the enemy warriors and turned the Bren\ngun on the others you would all be gone now. Possibly none of you would\nhave survived.\"\n\nSally quieted him with a chill look. \"Let me repeat what is well known\nto every member of the clan. We consist of less than sixty women, a few\nmore than thirty-five of whom are active. There are twenty sterilies\nand twenty-five or so children. And one husband. A few more than one\nhundred in all.\"\n\nHer voice slowed and lowered for the sake of emphasis. \"All of our\nwomen--except for two or three--might die and the clan would live on.\nThe sterilies certainly might all die, and the clan live on. Even the\nchildren could all die and the clan live on. _But if our husband dies,\nthe clan dies._ The greatest responsibility of every member of any\nclan is to protect the husband. Under no circumstances is he to be\nendangered. You know this, it should not have to be brought to your\nattention.\"\n\nThere was a strong murmur of assent from those seated before them.\n\nAlan said, \"But, Sally, I saved your lives! And if I hadn't, I would\nhave been captured by the Crows and Horses and you would have lost me\nat any rate.\"\n\nThis was hard for Sally Wolf, but she said, \"Then, at least, _they_\nwould have had you. If you had died, in your foolhardiness, you would\nhave been gone for all of us. Alan, two clans, husbandless clans,\nunited in this attempt to capture you from us. While we fought to\nprotect our husband, the life of our clan, we hold no rancor against\nthem. In their position, we would have done the same. Much rather\nwould we see you taken by them, than to see you dead. Even though the\nWolf clan might die, the race must go on.\" She added, but not very\nbelievably, \"If they had captured you, perhaps we could have, in our\nturn, captured a husband from some other clan.\"\n\n\"The reason we probably couldn't,\" Vivian said mildly, \"is that since\nwe've turned to agriculture and settled, our numbers have dropped off\nby half. We had more than sixty warriors while we were hunter-foragers.\"\n\n\"That's enough, Vivian,\" Sally snapped. \"The question isn't being\ndiscussed this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Ought to be,\" somebody whispered down in front.\n\n\"Order,\" Alan said. He knew it was a growing belief in the clan that\ngiving up the nomadic life had been a mistake. From raiders, they had\nbecome the raided.\n\nSally said, \"The second order of business is the disposal of the Horse\nand Crow prisoners captured in the action today.\"\n\nVivian said, \"We can't afford to waste valuable ammunition. I say shove\nthem into the canyon.\"\n\nMost of those seated in the hall approved of that. Some were puzzled\nof face, wondering why the matter hadn't been left simply in the scout\nchief's hands.\n\nSally said, dryly, \"I haven't formed an opinion myself. However, our\nchairman has some words to say.\"\n\nVivian looked at Alan as though he was a precocious child. She shook\nher head. \"You cutie, you. You're getting bigger and bigger for your\nbritches every day.\"\n\nTwo or three of the warriors echoed her by chuckling fondly.\n\nAlan said nothing to that, needing to maintain what dignity and\nprestige he could muster.\n\nHe stood and faced them and waited for their silence before saying,\n\"You feminine members of the clan are too busy with work and with\ndefense to pursue some of the studies for which we men find time.\"\n\nVivian murmured, \"You ain't just a whistlin', honey. But we don't mind.\nYou do what you want with your time, honey.\"\n\nHe tried to smile politely, but went on. \"It has come to the point\nwhere few women read to any extent and most learning has fallen into\nthe hands of the men--few as we are.\"\n\nSally said impatiently, \"What has this got to do with the prisoners,\nAlan dear?\"\n\nIt would seem that he had ignored her when he said, \"I have been\ndiscussing the matter with Warren of the Turtle clan and two or three\nother men with whom I occasionally come in contact. At the rate\nthe race is going, there will be no men left at all in another few\ngenerations.\"\n\nThere was quiet in the long hall. Deathly quiet.\n\nSally said, \"How ... how do you mean, dear?\"\n\n\"I mean our present system can't go on. It isn't working.\"\n\n\"Of course it's working,\" Vivian snapped. \"Here we are aren't we? It's\nalways worked, it always will. Here's the clan. You're our husband.\nAfter we've had you for twenty years, we'll trade you to another clan\nfor their husband--prevents interbreeding. If you have a fertile son,\nthe clan will either split, each half taking one husband, or we'll\ntrade him off for land, or guns, or whatever else is valuable. Of\ncourse, it works.\"\n\nHe shook his head, stubbornly. \"Things are changing. For a generation\nor two after bomb day, we were in chaos. By time things cleared we\nwere divided as we are now, in clans. However, we were still largely\nable to exist on the canned goods, the animals, left over from the old\ndays. There was food and guns for all and only a few of the men were\nsterilies.\"\n\nVivian began to say something again, but he shook a hand negatively at\nher, pleading for silence. \"No, I'm not talking about myth-legend now.\nWarren's great-grandfather, whom he knew as a boy, remembers when there\nwere four times or more the number of men we have today and when the\nsterilies were very few.\"\n\nVivian said impatiently, \"What's this got to do with the prisoners?\nThere they are. We can kill them or let them go. If we let them go,\nthey'll be coming back, six months from now, to take another crack at\nus. Alan is cute as a button, but I don't think he should meddle in\nwomen's affairs.\"\n\nBut most of them were silent. They looked up at him, waiting for him to\ngo on.\n\n\"I suppose,\" Sally said, \"that you're coming to a point, dear?\"\n\nHe nodded, his face tight. \"I'm coming to the point. The point is that\nwe've got to change the basis of clan society. This isn't working any\nmore--if it ever did. There's such a thing as planned breeding ...\" it\nhad been hard to say this, and the younger women in the audience, in\nparticular, tittered \"... and we're going to have to think in terms of\nit.\"\n\nSally had flushed. She said now, \"A certain dignity is expected at a\nclan meeting, Alan dear. But just what did you mean?\"\n\nVivian said, \"This is nonsense, I'm leaving,\" and she was up from the\nspeaker's table and away. Two or three of her younger girls looked\nafter, scowling, but they didn't follow her out of the hall.\n\n\"I mean,\" Alan said doggedly, \"that one of those Crow women has been\nthe mother of two fertile men. To my knowledge she is the only woman\nwithin hundreds of miles this can be said about. We men have been\nkeeping records of such things.\"\n\nSally was as mystified as the rest of the clan.\n\nAlan said, \"I say bring these women into the clan. Unite with the\nTurtles and the Burros so that we'll have three clans, five counting\nthe Horses and Crows. Then we'll have enough strength to fight off the\nforager-hunters, and we'll have enough men to experiment in selective\nbreeding.\"\n\nHalf of the hall was on its feet in a roar.\n\n\"Share you with these ... these desert rats who just raided us, who\nkilled eight of our clan?\" Sally snapped, flabbergasted.\n\nHe stood his ground. \"Yes. I'll repeat, one of those Crow women has\nborne two fertile men children. We can't afford to kill her. For all we\nknow, she might have a dozen more. This haphazard method of a single\nhusband for a whole clan must be replaced....\"\n\nThe hall broke down into chaos again.\n\nSally held up a commanding hand for silence. She said, \"And if we share\nyou with another forty or fifty women, to what extent will the rest of\nus have any husband at all?\"\n\nHe pointed out the sterilies, seated silently in the back. \"It would\nbe healthier if you gave up some of this superior contempt you hold\nfor sterile males and accept their companionship. Although they cannot\nbe fathers, they can be mates otherwise. As it is, how much true\ncompanionship do you secure from me--any of you? Less than once a month\ndo you see me more than from a distance.\"\n\n\"Mate with sterilies?\" someone gasped from the front row.\n\n\"Yes,\" Alan snapped back. \"And let fertile men be used expressly for\nattempting to produce additional fertile men. Confound it, can't you\nwarriors realize what I'm saying? I have reports that there is a woman\namong the Crows who has borne two fertile male children. Have you ever\nheard of any such phenomenon before? Do you realize that in the fifteen\nyears I have been the husband of this clan, we have not had even one\nfertile man child born? Do you realize that in the past twenty years\nthere has been born not one fertile man child in the Turtle clan? Only\none in the Burro clan?\"\n\nHe had them in the palm of his hand now.\n\n\"What--what does the Turtle clan think of this plan of yours?\" Sally\nsaid.\n\n\"I was talking to Warren just the other day. He thinks he can win their\napproval. We can also probably talk the Burros into it. They're growing\ndesperate. Their husband is nearly sixty years old and has produced\nonly one fertile male child, which was later captured in a raid by the\nDenver foragers.\"\n\nSally said, \"And we'd have to share you with all these, and with our\nprisoners as well?\"\n\n\"Yes, in an attempt to breed fertile men back into the race.\"\n\nSally turned to the assembled clan.\n\nA heavy explosion, room-shaking in its violence, all but threw them\nto the floor. Half a dozen of the younger warriors scurried to the\nwindows, guns at the ready.\n\nIn the distance, from the outside, there was the chatter of a machine\ngun, then individual pistol shots.\n\n\"The corral,\" Jean the scout said, her lips going back over her teeth.\n\nVivian came sauntering back into the assembly hall, patting the stock\nof her new tommy gun appreciately. \"Works like a charm,\" she said.\n\"That dynamite we captured was fresh too. Blew 'em to smithereens. Only\nhad to finish off half a dozen.\"\n\nAlan said, agonizingly, \"Vivian! You didn't ... the prisoners?\"\n\nShe grinned at him. \"Alan, you're as cute as a button, but you don't\nknow anything about women's affairs.
