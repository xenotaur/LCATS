B.\n          Drysdale.\n\n          Miss Elspeth Dudgeon. Miss Lola Duncan.\n\n          The Scene is laid in a Lanarkshire\n          Colliery Village.\n\n\n\n          Modern industrialism has evolved its\n          special types, and the Lanarkshire\n          collier is small and wiry. He swings a\n          pickaxe for hours on end crouched in an\n          impossibly small space in heated\n          atmosphere, and physique on the grand\n          scale is unsuited to such conditions. He\n          takes tremendous risks as part of his\n          daily routine. His recreations are, to a\n          fastidious taste, coarse. He works hard\n          under ground and plays hard above\n          ground. Constrained attitude is so much\n          his second nature that he sits in\n          perfect comfort on his haunches, in the\n          pictured pose of the mild Hindoo, his\n          back to a wall, discussing, amongst\n          expectoration\u2014a long row of him\u2014,\n          football, dogs, his last spree and his\n          next, the police reports, women.\n\n          Altogether a most unpleasant person,\n          this undersized, foul-mouthed, sporting\n          hewer of coal-until you come to know him\n          better, to discover his simplicity of\n          soul, his directness, his matter-of-fact\n          self-sacrifice, the unconscious heroism\n          of his life: and to lose sight of his\n          superficial frailties in your admiration\n          for his finer qualities.\n\n          The womenkind of the colliers are marked\n          by the life of the pits no less than the\n          men. They are rough, capable housewives,\n          dressing with more care for durability\n          than effect, tolerant of their menfolks\u2019\n          weaknesses, and, above all, stamped with\n          the pit-side stoicism apt to be mistaken\n          for callousness. The sudden death of\n          their breadwinner is an everyday hazard,\n          accepted without complaint and without\n          concealment as part of their life. Like\n          their husbands, they exist from hand to\n          mouth on the brink of eternity. Thrift,\n          when any day\u2019s work may be your last,\n          seems a misplaced virtue. Lean fare\n          approaches as pay day recedes, and\n          illness, meagrely provided for by\n          membership of a \u201csick\u201d society, is tided\n          over in the main by the unfailing\n          generosity of neighbours whose own table\n          suffers by the charity.\n\n          SCENE\n\n          The scene represents the living room of\n          a collier\u2019s cottage in Lanarkshire. The\n          room has three doors, one to the right\n          and one to the left, which lead to the\n          sleeping rooms, and one in the centre\n          which opens on to the village street. A\n          fireplace with a cooking stove set in it\n          is at the right. A holland blind is\n          drawn down at the window, but it does\n          not completely shut out the night, which\n          is now dissolving into a grey, cold\n          dawn, for the cheap German alarm clock\n          that ticks loudly on the mantleshelf\n          marks the hour five-thirty. When the\n          curtain rises the room is in darkness\n          save for the glint of bluish-grey light\n          that shows at the window. Then Mary\n          Brown enters from the door on the right,\n          she strikes a match and lights a lamp,\n          when you see she is a girl of about\n          twenty; she does not look her best, her\n          hair has been hurriedly screwed up, her\n          print blouse, murky with toil, has not\n          yet been fastened, she wears a draggle-\n          tailed skirt of sombre colour and list\n          slippers are on her feet.\n\n          A small spirit-lamp is on the hob and a\n          little tin kettle near by; she lights\n          the lamp, puts the kettle on it, then\n          crosses to the door on the left and\n          knocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n          MARY\n\n          Are ye up, Jock?\n\n          JOCK\n\n          (within)\n\n          Aw richt, A\u2019ll be there in a meenit.\n\n          Mary takes a plain and fairly clean\n          apron from a hook by the dresser and\n          puts it on briskly; she then takes a cup\n          and saucer from the rack, putting them\n          on the dresser, from the cupboard of\n          which she takes a cocoa-tin and puts a\n          spoonful of cocoa in the cup. Then she\n          takes bread and meat from the cupboard\n          and makes a couple of huge sandwiches.\n          These she puts on a tin plate, and\n          covering them with another tin plate,\n          she ties the whole in a large red\n          handkerchief with the ends looped for\n          carrying. A tin can with a screw top is\n          placed near by. Then, from the door at\n          the left, enters Jock Brown, Mary\u2019s\n          cousin.\n\n          He is dressed in his working or \u201cblack\u201d\n           clothes, which may have been coloured\n          once but are now blackened with coal\n          dust. He wears no collar, but a muffler,\n          which, because it is doffed in the pit,\n          still preserves something of its\n          original hue, which was a bright red.\n\n          JOCK\n\n          A wis hardly expectin\u2019 tae see you this\n          mornin\u2019, Mary.\n\n          MARY\n\n          (apparently unmoved, proceeds with her\n          operations at the stove)\n\n          An\u2019 why no\u2019, bless ye.

Mary, left alone, begins to\n          tidy up and prepare the house for the\n          use of the day. Soon the door at the\n          right opens, and Ellen Brown, Jock\u2019s\n          mother, enters. She is an old woman, but\n          not so old as she looks; her spare\n          figure bears all the marks of a life\n          that is one continuous struggle against\n          a hard fate. She is dressed plainly in\n          black, with an apron; her head is\n          covered with a shawl. Mary, who is at\n          the window rolling up the broken blind,\n          starts and turns to her in surprise.\n\n          MARY\n\n          Why, auntie, ye\u2019re up airly.\n\n          ELLEN\n\n          Aye.

In it thirteen plays were produced,\n          including the first production in\n          English of a play by the Russian\n          dramatist, Anton Tchekhov, \u201cThe\n          Seagull,\u201d and six entirely new plays.\n\n          In the Spring season, 1910, \u201cJustice,\u201d\n           produced simultaneously in London,\n          created an unique record in the history\n          of the British stage, while astonishing\n          success attended the production of John\n          Masefield\u2019s masterpiece, \u201cThe Tragedy of\n          Nan.\u201d In all, seven entirely new plays\n          were produced.\n\n          The Summer season of lighter fare added\n          six more plays to the record, including\n          two new ones. In the fifth season ten\n          plays were produced, four entirely new.\n\n          In the sixth season, Spring, 1911,\n          fifteen plays were produced, seven\n          entirely new. In all seventy-three plays\n          have been produced, of which about\n          fifty-five would never have been seen\n          but for the energies of this Theatre.",
