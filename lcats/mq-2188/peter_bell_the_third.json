Although he may fall short of those\nvery considerable personages in the more active properties which\ncharacterize the Rat and the Apostate, I suspect that even you, their\nhistorian, will confess that he surpasses them in the more peculiarly\nlegitimate qualification of intolerable dulness.\n\nYou know Mr. Examiner Hunt; well--it was he who presented me to two of\nthe Mr. Bells. My intimacy with the younger Mr. Bell naturally sprung\nfrom this introduction to his brothers. And in presenting him to you, I\nhave the satisfaction of being able to assure you that he is\nconsiderably the dullest of the three.\n\nThere is this particular advantage in an acquaintance with any one of\nthe Peter Bells, that if you know one Peter Bell, you know three Peter\nBells; they are not one, but three; not three, but one. An awful\nmystery, which, after having caused torrents of blood, and having been\nhymned by groans enough to deafen the music of the spheres, is at length\nillustrated to the satisfaction of all parties in the theological world,\nby the nature of Mr. Peter Bell.\n\nPeter is a polyhedric Peter, or a Peter with many sides. He changes\ncolours like a chameleon, and his coat like a snake. He is a Proteus of\na Peter. He was at first sublime, pathetic, impressive, profound; then\ndull; then prosy and dull; and now dull--oh so very dull! it is an\nultra-legitimate dulness.\n\nYou will perceive that it is not necessary to consider Hell and the\nDevil as supernatural machinery. The whole scene of my epic is in 'this\nworld which is'--so Peter informed us before his conversion to \"White\nObi\"--\n\n     'The world of all of us, AND WHERE\n     WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS, OR NOT AT ALL.'\n\nLet me observe that I have spent six or seven days in composing this\nsublime piece; the orb of my moonlike genius has made the fourth part of\nits revolution round the dull earth which you inhabit, driving you mad,\nwhile it has retained its calmness and its splendour, and I have been\nfitting this its last phase 'to occupy a permanent station in the\nliterature of my country.'\n\nYour works, indeed, dear Tom, sell better; but mine are far superior.\nThe public is no judge; posterity sets all to rights.\n\nAllow me to observe that so much has been written of Peter Bell, that\nthe present history can be considered only, like the Iliad, as a\ncontinuation of that series of cyclic poems, which have already been\ncandidates for bestowing immortality upon, at the same time that they\nreceive it from, his character and adventures. In this point of view I\nhave violated no rule of syntax in beginning my composition with a\nconjunction; the full stop which closes the poem continued by me being,\nlike the full stops at the end of the Iliad and Odyssey, a full stop of\na very qualified import.\n\nHoping that the immortality which you have given to the Fudges, you will\nreceive from them; and in the firm expectation, that when London shall\nbe an habitation of bitterns; when St. Paul's and Westminster Abbey\nshall stand, shapeless and nameless ruins, in the midst of an unpeopled\nmarsh; when the piers of Waterloo Bridge shall become the nuclei of\nislets of reeds and osiers, and cast the jagged shadows of their broken\narches on the solitary stream, some transatlantic commentator will be\nweighing in the scales of some new and now unimagined system of\ncriticism, the respective merits of the Bells and the Fudges, and their\nhistorians. I remain, dear Tom, yours sincerely,\n\nMICHING MALLECHO.\n\nDecember 1, 1819.\n\nP.S.--Pray excuse the date of place; so soon as the profits of the\npublication come in, I mean to hire lodgings in a more respectable\nstreet.\n\n\n\n\nPROLOGUE.\n\n Peter Bells, one, two and three,\n O'er the wide world wandering be.--\n First, the antenatal Peter,\n Wrapped in weeds of the same metre,\n The so-long-predestined raiment                                 5\n Clothed in which to walk his way meant\n The second Peter; whose ambition\n Is to link the proposition,\n As the mean of two extremes--\n (This was learned from Aldric's themes)                         10\n Shielding from the guilt of schism\n The orthodoxal syllogism;\n The First Peter--he who was\n Like the shadow in the glass\n Of the second, yet unripe,                                      15\n His substantial antitype.--\n\n Then came Peter Bell the Second,\n Who henceforward must be reckoned\n The body of a double soul,\n And that portion of the whole                                   20\n Without which the rest would seem\n Ends of a disjointed dream.--\n And the Third is he who has\n O'er the grave been forced to pass\n To the other side, which is,--                                  25\n Go and try else,--just like this.\n\n Peter Bell the First was Peter\n Smugger, milder, softer, neater,\n Like the soul before it is\n Born from THAT world into THIS.                                 30\n The next Peter Bell was he,\n Predevote, like you and me,\n To good or evil as may come;\n His was the severer doom,--\n For he was an evil Cotter,                                      35\n And a polygamic Potter.\n And the last is Peter Bell,\n Damned since our first parents fell,\n Damned eternally to Hell--\n Surely he deserves it well!                                     40\n\n\n\n\nPART 1. DEATH.\n\n 1.\n And Peter Bell, when he had been\n With fresh-imported Hell-fire warmed,\n Grew serious--from his dress and mien\n 'Twas very plainly to be seen\n Peter was quite reformed.                                       5\n\n 2.\n His eyes turned up, his mouth turned down;\n His accent caught a nasal twang;\n He oiled his hair; there might be heard\n The grace of God in every word\n Which Peter said or sang.                                       10\n\n 3.\n But Peter now grew old, and had\n An ill no doctor could unravel:\n His torments almost drove him mad;--\n Some said it was a fever bad--\n Some swore it was the gravel.                                   15\n\n 4.\n His holy friends then came about,\n And with long preaching and persuasion\n Convinced the patient that, without\n The smallest shadow of a doubt,\n He was predestined to damnation.                                20\n\n 5.\n They said--'Thy name is Peter Bell;\n Thy skin is of a brimstone hue;\n Alive or dead--ay, sick or well--\n The one God made to rhyme with hell;\n The other, I think, rhymes with you.                            25\n\n 6.\n Then Peter set up such a yell!--\n The nurse, who with some water gruel\n Was climbing up the stairs, as well\n As her old legs could climb them--fell,\n And broke them both--the fall was cruel.                        30\n\n 7.\n The Parson from the casement lept\n Into the lake of Windermere--\n And many an eel--though no adept\n In God's right reason for it--kept\n Gnawing his kidneys half a year.                                35\n\n 8.\n And all the rest rushed through the door\n And tumbled over one another,\n And broke their skulls.--Upon the floor\n Meanwhile sat Peter Bell, and swore,\n And cursed his father and his mother;                           40\n\n 9.\n And raved of God, and sin, and death,\n Blaspheming like an infidel;\n And said, that with his clenched teeth\n He'd seize the earth from underneath,\n And drag it with him down to hell.                              45\n\n 10.\n As he was speaking came a spasm,\n And wrenched his gnashing teeth asunder;\n Like one who sees a strange phantasm\n He lay,--there was a silent chasm\n Between his upper jaw and under.                                50\n\n 11.\n And yellow death lay on his face;\n And a fixed smile that was not human\n Told, as I understand the case,\n That he was gone to the wrong place:--\n I heard all this from the old woman.                            55\n\n 12.\n Then there came down from Langdale Pike\n A cloud, with lightning, wind and hail;\n It swept over the mountains like\n An ocean,--and I heard it strike\n The woods and crags of Grasmere vale.                           60\n\n 13.\n And I saw the black storm come\n Nearer, minute after minute;\n Its thunder made the cataracts dumb;\n With hiss, and clash, and hollow hum,\n It neared as if the Devil was in it.                            65\n\n 14.\n The Devil WAS in it:--he had bought\n Peter for half-a-crown; and when\n The storm which bore him vanished, nought\n That in the house that storm had caught\n Was ever seen again.                                            70\n\n 15.\n The gaping neighbours came next day--\n They found all vanished from the shore:\n The Bible, whence he used to pray,\n Half scorched under a hen-coop lay;\n Smashed glass--and nothing more!                                75\n\n\n\n\nPART 2. THE DEVIL.\n\n 1.\n The Devil, I safely can aver,\n Has neither hoof, nor tail, nor sting;\n Nor is he, as some sages swear,\n A spirit, neither here nor there,\n In nothing--yet in everything.                                  80\n\n 2.\n He is--what we are; for sometimes\n The Devil is a gentleman;\n At others a bard bartering rhymes\n For sack; a statesman spinning crimes;\n A swindler, living as he can;                                   85\n\n 3.\n A thief, who cometh in the night,\n With whole boots and net pantaloons,\n Like some one whom it were not right\n To mention;--or the luckless wight\n From whom he steals nine silver spoons.                         90\n\n 4.\n But in this case he did appear\n Like a slop-merchant from Wapping,\n And with smug face, and eye severe,\n On every side did perk and peer\n Till he saw Peter dead or napping.                              95\n\n 5.\n He had on an upper Benjamin\n (For he was of the driving schism)\n In the which he wrapped his skin\n From the storm he travelled in,\n For fear of rheumatism.                                         100\n\n 6.\n He called the ghost out of the corse;--\n It was exceedingly like Peter,--\n Only its voice was hollow and hoarse--\n It had a queerish look of course--\n Its dress too was a little neater.                              105\n\n 7.\n The Devil knew not his name and lot;\n Peter knew not that he was Bell:\n Each had an upper stream of thought,\n Which made all seem as it was not;\n Fitting itself to all things well.                              110\n\n 8.\n Peter thought he had parents dear,\n Brothers, sisters, cousins, cronies,\n In the fens of Lincolnshire;\n He perhaps had found them there\n Had he gone and boldly shown his                                115\n\n 9.\n Solemn phiz in his own village;\n Where he thought oft when a boy\n He'd clomb the orchard walls to pillage\n The produce of his neighbour's tillage,\n With marvellous pride and joy.                                  120\n\n 10.\n And the Devil thought he had,\n 'Mid the misery and confusion\n Of an unjust war, just made\n A fortune by the gainful trade\n Of giving soldiers rations bad--                                125\n The world is full of strange delusion--\n\n 11.\n That he had a mansion planned\n In a square like Grosvenor Square,\n That he was aping fashion, and\n That he now came to Westmoreland                                130\n To see what was romantic there.\n\n 12.\n And all this, though quite ideal,--\n Ready at a breath to vanish,--\n Was a state not more unreal\n Than the peace he could not feel,                               135\n Or the care he could not banish.\n\n 13.\n After a little conversation,\n The Devil told Peter, if he chose,\n He'd bring him to the world of fashion\n By giving him a situation                                       140\n In his own service--and new clothes.\n\n 14.\n And Peter bowed, quite pleased and proud,\n And after waiting some few days\n For a new livery--dirty yellow\n Turned up with black--the wretched fellow                       145\n Was bowled to Hell in the Devil's chaise.\n\n\n\n\nPART 3. HELL.\n\n 1.\n Hell is a city much like London--\n A populous and a smoky city;\n There are all sorts of people undone,\n And there is little or no fun done;                             150\n Small justice shown, and still less pity.\n\n 2.\n There is a Castles, and a Canning,\n A Cobbett, and a Castlereagh;\n All sorts of caitiff corpses planning\n All sorts of cozening for trepanning                            155\n Corpses less corrupt than they.\n\n 3.\n There is a ***, who has lost\n His wits, or sold them, none knows which;\n He walks about a double ghost,\n And though as thin as Fraud almost--                            160\n Ever grows more grim and rich.\n\n 4.\n There is a Chancery Court; a King;\n A manufacturing mob; a set\n Of thieves who by themselves are sent\n Similar thieves to represent;                                   165\n An army; and a public debt.\n\n 5.\n Which last is a scheme of paper money,\n And means--being interpreted--\n 'Bees, keep your wax--give us the honey,\n And we will plant, while skies are sunny,                       170\n Flowers, which in winter serve instead.'\n\n 6.\n There is a great talk of revolution--\n And a great chance of despotism--\n German soldiers--camps--confusion--\n Tumults--lotteries--rage--delusion--                            175\n Gin--suicide--and methodism;\n\n 7.\n Taxes too, on wine and bread,\n And meat, and beer, and tea, and cheese,\n From which those patriots pure are fed,\n Who gorge before they reel to bed                               180\n The tenfold essence of all these.\n\n 8.\n There are mincing women, mewing,\n (Like cats, who amant misere,)\n Of their own virtue, and pursuing\n Their gentler sisters to that ruin,                             185\n Without which--what were chastity?\n\n 9.\n Lawyers--judges--old hobnobbers\n Are there--bailiffs--chancellors--\n Bishops--great and little robbers--\n Rhymesters--pamphleteers--stock-jobbers--                       190\n Men of glory in the wars,--\n\n 10.\n Things whose trade is, over ladies\n To lean, and flirt, and stare, and simper,\n Till all that is divine in woman\n Grows cruel, courteous, smooth, inhuman,                        195\n Crucified 'twixt a smile and whimper.\n\n 11.\n Thrusting, toiling, wailing, moiling,\n Frowning, preaching--such a riot!\n Each with never-ceasing labour,\n Whilst he thinks he cheats his neighbour,                       200\n Cheating his own heart of quiet.\n\n 12.\n And all these meet at levees;--\n Dinners convivial and political;--\n Suppers of epic poets;--teas,\n Where small talk dies in agonies;--                             205\n Breakfasts professional and critical;\n\n 13.\n Lunches and snacks so aldermanic\n That one would furnish forth ten dinners,\n Where reigns a Cretan-tongued panic,\n Lest news Russ, Dutch, or Alemannic                             210\n Should make some losers, and some winners--\n\n 45.\n At conversazioni--balls--\n Conventicles--and drawing-rooms--\n Courts of law--committees--calls\n Of a morning--clubs--book-stalls--                              215\n Churches--masquerades--and tombs.\n\n\n 15.\n And this is Hell--and in this smother\n All are damnable and damned;\n Each one damning, damns the other;\n They are damned by one another,                                 220\n By none other are they damned.\n\n 16.\n 'Tis a lie to say, 'God damns'!\n Where was Heaven's Attorney General\n When they first gave out such flams?\n Let there be an end of shams,                                   225\n They are mines of poisonous mineral.\n\n 17.\n Statesmen damn themselves to be\n Cursed; and lawyers damn their souls\n To the auction of a fee;\n Churchmen damn themselves to see                                230\n God's sweet love in burning coals.\n\n 18.\n The rich are damned, beyond all cure,\n To taunt, and starve, and trample on\n The weak and wretched; and the poor\n Damn their broken hearts to endure                              235\n Stripe on stripe, with groan on groan.\n\n 19.\n Sometimes the poor are damned indeed\n To take,--not means for being blessed,--\n But Cobbett's snuff, revenge; that weed\n From which the worms that it doth feed                          240\n Squeeze less than they before possessed.\n\n 20.\n And some few, like we know who,\n Damned--but God alone knows why--\n To believe their minds are given\n To make this ugly Hell a Heaven;                                245\n In which faith they live and die.\n\n 21.\n Thus, as in a town, plague-stricken,\n Each man be he sound or no\n Must indifferently sicken;\n As when day begins to thicken,                                  250\n None knows a pigeon from a crow,--\n\n 22.\n So good and bad, sane and mad,\n The oppressor and the oppressed;\n Those who weep to see what others\n Smile to inflict upon their brothers;

SIN.\n\n 1.\n Lo. Peter in Hell's Grosvenor Square,\n A footman in the Devil's service!\n And the misjudging world would swear                            265\n That every man in service there\n To virtue would prefer vice.\n\n 2.\n But Peter, though now damned, was not\n What Peter was before damnation.\n Men oftentimes prepare a lot                                    270\n Which ere it finds them, is not what\n Suits with their genuine station.\n\n 3.\n All things that Peter saw and felt\n Had a peculiar aspect to him;\n And when they came within the belt                              275\n Of his own nature, seemed to melt,\n Like cloud to cloud, into him.\n\n 4.\n And so the outward world uniting\n To that within him, he became\n Considerably uninviting                                         280\n To those who, meditation slighting,\n Were moulded in a different frame.\n\n 5.\n And he scorned them, and they scorned him;\n And he scorned all they did; and they\n Did all that men of their own trim                              285\n Are wont to do to please their whim,\n Drinking, lying, swearing, play.\n\n 6.\n Such were his fellow-servants; thus\n His virtue, like our own, was built\n Too much on that indignant fuss                                 290\n Hypocrite Pride stirs up in us\n To bully one another's guilt.\n\n 7.\n He had a mind which was somehow\n At once circumference and centre\n Of all he might or feel or know;                                295\n Nothing went ever out, although\n Something did ever enter.\n\n 8.\n He had as much imagination\n As a pint-pot;--he never could\n Fancy another situation,                                        300\n From which to dart his contemplation,\n Than that wherein he stood.\n\n 9.\n Yet his was individual mind,\n And new created all he saw\n In a new manner, and refined                                    305\n Those new creations, and combined\n Them, by a master-spirit's law.\n\n 10.\n Thus--though unimaginative--\n An apprehension clear, intense,\n Of his mind's work, had made alive                              310\n The things it wrought on; I believe\n Wakening a sort of thought in sense.\n\n 11.\n But from the first 'twas Peter's drift\n To be a kind of moral eunuch,\n He touched the hem of Nature's shift,                           315\n Felt faint--and never dared uplift\n The closest, all-concealing tunic.\n\n 12.\n She laughed the while, with an arch smile,\n And kissed him with a sister's kiss,\n And said--My best Diogenes,                                     320\n I love you well--but, if you please,\n Tempt not again my deepest bliss.\n\n 13.\n ''Tis you are cold--for I, not coy,\n Yield love for love, frank, warm, and true;\n And Burns, a Scottish peasant boy--                             325\n His errors prove it--knew my joy\n More, learned friend, than you.\n\n 14.\n 'Boeca bacciata non perde ventura,\n Anzi rinnuova come fa la luna:--\n So thought Boccaccio, whose sweet words might cure a            330\n Male prude, like you, from what you now endure, a\n Low-tide in soul, like a stagnant laguna.\n\n 15.\n Then Peter rubbed his eyes severe.\n And smoothed his spacious forehead down\n With his broad palm;--'twixt love and fear,                     335\n He looked, as he no doubt felt, queer,\n And in his dream sate down.\n\n 16.\n The Devil was no uncommon creature;\n A leaden-witted thief--just huddled\n Out of the dross and scum of nature;                            340\n A toad-like lump of limb and feature,\n With mind, and heart, and fancy muddled.\n\n 17.\n He was that heavy, dull, cold thing,\n The spirit of evil well may be:\n A drone too base to have a sting;                               345\n Who gluts, and grimes his lazy wing,\n And calls lust, luxury.\n\n 18.\n Now he was quite the kind of wight\n Round whom collect, at a fixed aera,\n Venison, turtle, hock, and claret,--                            350\n Good cheer--and those who come to share it--\n And best East Indian madeira!\n\n 19.\n It was his fancy to invite\n Men of science, wit, and learning,\n Who came to lend each other light;                              355\n He proudly thought that his gold's might\n Had set those spirits burning.\n\n 20.\n And men of learning, science, wit,\n Considered him as you and I\n Think of some rotten tree, and sit                              360\n Lounging and dining under it,\n Exposed to the wide sky.\n\n 21.\n And all the while with loose fat smile,\n The willing wretch sat winking there,\n Believing 'twas his power that made                             365\n That jovial scene--and that all paid\n Homage to his unnoticed chair.\n\n 22.\n Though to be sure this place was Hell;\n He was the Devil--and all they--\n What though the claret circled well,                            370\n And wit, like ocean, rose and fell?--\n Were damned eternally.\n\n\n\n\nPART 5. GRACE.\n\n 1.\n Among the guests who often stayed\n Till the Devil's petits-soupers,\n A man there came, fair as a maid,                               375\n And Peter noted what he said,\n Standing behind his master's chair.\n\n 2.\n He was a mighty poet--and\n A subtle-souled psychologist;\n All things he seemed to understand,                             380\n Of old or new--of sea or land--\n But his own mind--which was a mist.\n\n 3.\n This was a man who might have turned\n Hell into Heaven--and so in gladness\n A Heaven unto himself have earned;                              385\n But he in shadows undiscerned\n Trusted.--and damned himself to madness.\n\n 4.\n He spoke of poetry, and how\n 'Divine it was--a light--a love--\n A spirit which like wind doth blow                              390\n As it listeth, to and fro;\n A dew rained down from God above;\n\n 5.\n 'A power which comes and goes like dream,\n And which none can ever trace--\n Heaven's light on earth--Truth's brightest beam.'               395\n And when he ceased there lay the gleam\n Of those words upon his face.\n\n 6.\n Now Peter, when he heard such talk,\n Would, heedless of a broken pate,\n Stand like a man asleep, or balk                                400\n Some wishing guest of knife or fork,\n Or drop and break his master's plate.\n\n 7.\n At night he oft would start and wake\n Like a lover, and began\n In a wild measure songs to make                                 405\n On moor, and glen, and rocky lake,\n And on the heart of man--\n\n 8.\n And on the universal sky--\n And the wide earth's bosom green,--\n And the sweet, strange mystery                                  410\n Of what beyond these things may lie,\n And yet remain unseen.\n\n 9.\n For in his thought he visited\n The spots in which, ere dead and damned,\n He his wayward life had led;                                    415\n Yet knew not whence the thoughts were fed\n Which thus his fancy crammed.\n\n 10.\n And these obscure remembrances\n Stirred such harmony in Peter,\n That, whensoever he should please,                              420\n He could speak of rocks and trees\n In poetic metre.\n\n 11.\n For though it was without a sense\n Of memory, yet he remembered well\n Many a ditch and quick-set fence;                               425\n Of lakes he had intelligence,\n He knew something of heath and fell.\n\n 12.\n He had also dim recollections\n Of pedlars tramping on their rounds;\n Milk-pans and pails; and odd collections                        430\n Of saws, and proverbs; and reflections\n Old parsons make in burying-grounds.\n\n 13.\n But Peter's verse was clear, and came\n Announcing from the frozen hearth\n Of a cold age, that none might tame                             435\n The soul of that diviner flame\n It augured to the Earth:\n\n 14.\n Like gentle rains, on the dry plains,\n Making that green which late was gray,\n Or like the sudden moon, that stains                            440\n Some gloomy chamber's window-panes\n With a broad light like day.\n\n 15.\n For language was in Peter's hand\n Like clay while he was yet a potter;\n And he made songs for all the land,                             445\n Sweet both to feel and understand,\n As pipkins late to mountain Cotter.\n\n 16.\n And Mr. --, the bookseller,\n Gave twenty pounds for some;--then scorning\n A footman's yellow coat to wear,                                450\n Peter, too proud of heart, I fear,\n Instantly gave the Devil warning.\n\n 17.\n Whereat the Devil took offence,\n And swore in his soul a great oath then,\n 'That for his damned impertinence                               455\n He'd bring him to a proper sense\n Of what was due to gentlemen!'\n\n\n\n\nPART 6.

Verbovale, Esquire,\n With a brief note of compliment,                                535\n By that night's Carlisle mail. It went,\n And set his soul on fire.\n\n 17.\n Fire, which ex luce praebens fumum,\n Made him beyond the bottom see\n Of truth's clear well--when I and you, Ma'am,                   540\n Go, as we shall do, subter humum,\n We may know more than he.\n\n 18.\n Now Peter ran to seed in soul\n Into a walking paradox;\n For he was neither part nor whole,                              545\n Nor good, nor bad--nor knave nor fool;\n --Among the woods and rocks\n\n 19.\n Furious he rode, where late he ran,\n Lashing and spurring his tame hobby;\n Turned to a formal puritan,                                     550\n A solemn and unsexual man,--\n He half believed \"White Obi\".\n\n 20.\n This steed in vision he would ride,\n High trotting over nine-inch bridges,\n With Flibbertigibbet, imp of pride,                             555\n Mocking and mowing by his side--\n A mad-brained goblin for a guide--\n Over corn-fields, gates, and hedges.\n\n 21.\n After these ghastly rides, he came\n Home to his heart, and found from thence                        560\n Much stolen of its accustomed flame;\n His thoughts grew weak, drowsy, and lame\n Of their intelligence.\n\n 22.\n To Peter's view, all seemed one hue;\n He was no Whig, he was no Tory;                                 565\n No Deist and no Christian he;--\n He got so subtle, that to be\n Nothing, was all his glory.\n\n 23.\n One single point in his belief\n From his organization sprung,                                   570\n The heart-enrooted faith, the chief\n Ear in his doctrines' blighted sheaf,\n That 'Happiness is wrong';\n\n 24.\n So thought Calvin and Dominic;\n So think their fierce successors, who                           575\n Even now would neither stint nor stick\n Our flesh from off our bones to pick,\n If they might 'do their do.'\n\n 25.\n His morals thus were undermined:--\n The old Peter--the hard, old Potter--                           580\n Was born anew within his mind;\n He grew dull, harsh, sly, unrefined,\n As when he tramped beside the Otter.\n\n 26.\n In the death hues of agony\n Lambently flashing from a fish,                                 585\n Now Peter felt amused to see\n Shades like a rainbow's rise and flee,\n Mixed with a certain hungry wish.\n\n 27.\n So in his Country's dying face\n He looked--and, lovely as she lay,                              590\n Seeking in vain his last embrace,\n Wailing her own abandoned case,\n With hardened sneer he turned away:\n\n 28.\n And coolly to his own soul said;--\n 'Do you not think that we might make                            595\n A poem on her when she's dead:--\n Or, no--a thought is in my head--\n Her shroud for a new sheet I'll take:\n\n 29.\n 'My wife wants one.--Let who will bury\n This mangled corpse!

I have found the way                                   630\n To make a better thing of metre\n Than e'er was made by living creature\n Up to this blessed day.'\n\n 36.\n Then Peter wrote odes to the Devil;--\n In one of which he meekly said:                                 635\n 'May Carnage and Slaughter,\n Thy niece and thy daughter,\n May Rapine and Famine,\n Thy gorge ever cramming,\n Glut thee with living and dead!                                 640\n\n 37.\n 'May Death and Damnation,\n And Consternation,\n Flit up from Hell with pure intent!\n Slash them at Manchester,\n Glasgow, Leeds, and Chester;                                    645\n Drench all with blood from Avon to Trent.\n\n 38.\n 'Let thy body-guard yeomen\n Hew down babes and women,\n And laugh with bold triumph till Heaven be rent!\n When Moloch in Jewry                                            650\n Munched children with fury,\n It was thou, Devil, dining with pure intent.\n\n\n\n\nPART 7. DOUBLE DAMNATION.\n\n 1.\n The Devil now knew his proper cue.--\n Soon as he read the ode, he drove\n To his friend Lord MacMurderchouse's,                           655\n A man of interest in both houses,\n And said:--'For money or for love,\n\n 2.\n 'Pray find some cure or sinecure;\n To feed from the superfluous taxes\n A friend of ours--a poet--fewer                                 660\n Have fluttered tamer to the lure\n Than he.'

I hope I need require\n No pledge from you, that he will stir                           670\n In our affairs;--like Oliver.\n That he'll be worthy of his hire.'\n\n 5.\n These words exchanged, the news sent off\n To Peter, home the Devil hied,--\n Took to his bed; he had no cough,                               675\n No doctor,--meat and drink enough.--\n Yet that same night he died.\n\n 6.\n The Devil's corpse was leaded down;\n His decent heirs enjoyed his pelf,\n Mourning-coaches, many a one,                                   680\n Followed his hearse along the town:--\n Where was the Devil himself?\n\n 7.\n When Peter heard of his promotion,\n His eyes grew like two stars for bliss:\n There was a bow of sleek devotion                               685\n Engendering in his back; each motion\n Seemed a Lord's shoe to kiss.\n\n 8.\n He hired a house, bought plate, and made\n A genteel drive up to his door,\n With sifted gravel neatly laid,--                               690\n As if defying all who said,\n Peter was ever poor.\n\n 9.\n But a disease soon struck into\n The very life and soul of Peter--\n He walked about--slept--had the hue                             695\n Of health upon his cheeks--and few\n Dug better--none a heartier eater.\n\n 10.\n And yet a strange and horrid curse\n Clung upon Peter, night and day;\n Month after month the thing grew worse,                         700\n And deadlier than in this my verse\n I can find strength to say.\n\n 11.\n Peter was dull--he was at first\n Dull--oh, so dull--so very dull!\n Whether he talked, wrote, or rehearsed--                        705\n Still with this dulness was he cursed--\n Dull--beyond all conception--dull.\n\n 12.\n No one could read his books--no mortal,\n But a few natural friends, would hear him;\n The parson came not near his portal;                            710\n His state was like that of the immortal\n Described by Swift--no man could bear him.\n\n 13.\n His sister, wife, and children yawned,\n With a long, slow, and drear ennui,\n All human patience far beyond;                                  715\n Their hopes of Heaven each would have pawned,\n Anywhere else to be.\n\n 14.\n But in his verse, and in his prose,\n The essence of his dulness was\n Concentred and compressed so close,                             720\n 'Twould have made Guatimozin doze\n On his red gridiron of brass.\n\n 15.\n A printer's boy, folding those pages,\n Fell slumbrously upon one side;\n Like those famed Seven who slept three ages.                    725\n To wakeful frenzy's vigil--rages,\n As opiates, were the same applied.\n\n 16.\n Even the Reviewers who were hired\n To do the work of his reviewing,\n With adamantine nerves, grew tired;--                           730\n Gaping and torpid they retired,\n To dream of what they should be doing.\n\n 17.\n And worse and worse, the drowsy curse\n Yawned in him, till it grew a pest--\n A wide contagious atmosphere,                                   735\n Creeping like cold through all things near;\n A power to infect and to infest.\n\n 18.\n His servant-maids and dogs grew dull;\n His kitten, late a sportive elf;\n The woods and lakes, so beautiful,                              740\n Of dim stupidity were full.\n All grew dull as Peter's self.\n\n 19.\n The earth under his feet--the springs,\n Which lived within it a quick life,\n The air, the winds of many wings,                               745\n That fan it with new murmurings,\n Were dead to their harmonious strife.\n\n 20.\n The birds and beasts within the wood,\n The insects, and each creeping thing,\n Were now a silent multitude;                                    750\n Love's work was left unwrought--no brood\n Near Peter's house took wing.\n\n 21.\n And every neighbouring cottager\n Stupidly yawned upon the other:\n No jackass brayed; no little cur                                755\n Cocked up his ears;--no man would stir\n To save a dying mother.\n\n 22.\n Yet all from that charmed district went\n But some half-idiot and half-knave,\n Who rather than pay any rent,                                   760\n Would live with marvellous content,\n Over his father's grave.\n\n 23.\n No bailiff dared within that space,\n For fear of the dull charm, to enter;\n A man would bear upon his face,                                 765\n For fifteen months in any case,\n The yawn of such a venture.\n\n 24.\n Seven miles above--below--around--\n This pest of dulness holds its sway;\n A ghastly life without a sound;                                 770\n To Peter's soul the spell is bound--\n How should it ever pass away?",
