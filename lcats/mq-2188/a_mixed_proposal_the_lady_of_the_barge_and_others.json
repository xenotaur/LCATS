    "body": "\n\nA MIXED PROPOSAL\n\n\nMajor Brill, late of the Fenshire Volununteers, stood in front of the\nsmall piece of glass in the hatstand, and with a firm and experienced\nhand gave his new silk hat a slight tilt over the right eye.  Then he\ntook his cane and a new pair of gloves, and with a military but squeaky\ntread, passed out into the road.  It was a glorious day in early autumn,\nand the soft English landscape was looking its best, but despite the fact\nthat there was nothing more alarming in sight than a few cows on the\nhillside a mile away, the Major paused at his gate, and his face took on\nan appearance of the greatest courage and resolution before proceeding.\nThe road was dusty and quiet, except for the children playing at cottage\ndoors, and so hot that the Major, heedless of the fact that he could not\nreplace the hat at exactly the same angle, stood in the shade of a tree\nwhile he removed it and mopped his heated brow.\n\nHe proceeded on his way more leisurely, overtaking, despite his lack of\nspeed, another man who was walking still more slowly in the shade of the\nhedge.\n\n\"Fine day, Halibut,\" he said, briskly; \"fine day.\"\n\n\"Beautiful,\" said the other, making no attempt to keep pace with him.\n\n\"Country wants rain, though,\" cried the Major over his shoulder.\n\nHalibut assented, and walking slowly on, wondered vaguely what gaudy\ncolor it was that had attracted his eye.  It dawned on him at length that\nit must be the Major's tie, and he suddenly quickened his pace, by no\nmeans reassured as the man of war also quickened his.\n\n\"Halloa, Brill!\"  he cried.  \"Half a moment.\"\n\nThe Major stopped and waited for his friend; Halibut eyed the tie\nuneasily--it was fearfully and wonderfully made--but said nothing.\n\n\"Well?\"  said the Major, somewhat sharply.\n\n\"Oh--I was going to ask you, Brill--Confound it!  I've forgotten what I\nwas going to say now.  I daresay I shall soon think of it.  You're not in\na hurry?\"\n\n\"Well, I am, rather,\" said Brill.  \"Fact is-- Is my hat on straight,\nHalibut?\"\n\nThe other assuring him that it was, the Major paused in his career, and\ngripping the brim with both hands, deliberately tilted it over the right\neye again.\n\n\"You were saying--\" said Halibut, regarding this manoeuvre with secret\ndisapproval.\n\n\"Yes,\" murmured the Major, \"I was saying.  Well, I don't mind telling an\nold friend like you, Halibut, though it is a profound secret.  Makes me\nrather particular about my dress just now.  Women notice these things.\nI'm--sha'nt get much sympathy from a confirmed old bachelor like you--but\nI'm on my way to put a very momentous question.\"\n\n\"The devil you are!\"  said the other, blankly.\n\n\"Sir!\" said the astonished Major.\n\n\"Not Mrs. Riddel?\" said Halibut.\n\n\"Certainly, sir,\" said the Major, stiffly.  \"Why not?\"\n\n\"Only that I am going on the same errand,\" said the confirmed bachelor,\nwith desperate calmness.\n\nThe Major looked at him, and for the first time noticed an unusual\nneatness and dressiness in his friend's attire.  His collar was higher\nthan usual; his tie, of the whitest and finest silk, bore a pin he never\nremembered to have seen before; and for the first time since he had known\nhim, the Major, with a strange sinking at the heart, saw that he wore\nspats.\n\n\"This is extraordinary,\" he said, briefly.  \"Well, good-day, Halibut.\nCan't stop.\"\n\n\"Good-day,\" said the other.\n\nThe Major quickened his pace and shot ahead, and keeping in the shade of\nthe hedge, ground his teeth as the civilian on the other side of the road\nslowly, but surely, gained on him.\n\nIt became exciting.  The Major was handicapped by his upright bearing and\nshort military stride; the other, a simple child of the city, bent\nforward, swinging his arms and taking immense strides.  At a by-lane they\npicked up three small boys, who, trotting in their rear, made it evident\nby their remarks that they considered themselves the privileged\nspectators of a foot-race.  The Major could stand it no longer, and with\na cut of his cane at the foremost boy, softly called a halt.\n\n\"Well,\" said Halibut, stopping.\n\nThe man's manner was suspicious, not to say offensive, and the other had\nmuch ado to speak him fair.\n\n\"This is ridiculous,\" he said, trying to smile.  \"We can't walk in and\npropose in a duet.  One of us must go to-day and the other to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Halibut; \"that'll be the best plan.\"\n\n\"So childish,\" said the Major, with a careless laugh, \"two fellows\nwalking in hot and tired and proposing to her.\"\n\n\"Absurd,\" replied Halibut, and both men eyed each other carefully.\n\n\"So, if I'm unsuccessful, old chap,\" said the Major, in a voice which he\nstrove to render natural and easy, \"I will come straight back to your\nplace and let you know, so as not to keep you in suspense.\"\n\n\"You're very good,\" said Halibut, with some emotion; \"but I think I'll\ntake to-day, because I have every reason to believe that I have got one\nof my bilious attacks coming on to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Pooh! fancy, my dear fellow,\" said the Major, heartily; \"I never saw you\nlook better in my life.\"\n\n\"That's one of the chief signs,\" replied Halibut, shaking his head.  \"I'm\nafraid I must go to-day.\"\n\n\"I really cannot waive my right on account of your bilious attack,\" said\nthe Major haughtily.\n\n\"Your right?\" said Halibut, with spirit.\n\n\"My right!\" repeated the other.  \"I should have been there before you if\nyou had not stopped me in the first place.\"\n\n\"But I started first,\" said Halibut.\n\n\"Prove it,\" exclaimed the Major, warmly.\n\nThe other shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I shall certainly not give way,\" he said, calmly.  \"This is a matter in\nwhich my whole future is concerned.  It seems very odd, not to say\ninconvenient, that you should have chosen the same day as myself, Brill,\nfor such an errand--very odd.\"\n\n\"It's quite an accident,\" asseverated the Major; \"as a matter of fact,\nHalibut, I nearly went yesterday.  That alone gives me, I think, some\nclaim to precedence.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" said Halibut, slowly; \"it constitutes an excellent claim.\"\n\nThe Major regarded him with moistening eyes.  This was generous and\nnoble.  His opinion of Halibut rose.  \"And now you have been so frank\nwith me,\" said the latter, \"it is only fair that you should know I\nstarted out with the same intention three days ago and found her out.\nSo far as claims go, I think mine leads.\"\n\n\"Pure matter of opinion,\" said the disgusted Major; \"it really seems as\nthough we want an arbitrator.  Well, we'll have to make our call\ntogether, I suppose, but I'll take care not to give you any opportunity,\nHalibut, so don't cherish any delusions on that point.  Even you wouldn't\nhave the hardihood to propose before a third party, I should think; but\nif you do, I give you fair warning that I shall begin, too.\"\n\n\"This is most unseemly,\" said Halibut.  \"We'd better both go home and\nleave it for another day.\"\n\n\"When do you propose going, then?\"  asked the Major.\n\n\"Really, I haven't made up my mind,\" replied the other.\n\nThe Major shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"It won't do, Halibut,\" he said, grimly; \"it won't do.  I'm too old a\nsoldier to be caught that way.\"\n\nThere was a long pause.  The Major mopped his brow again.  \"I've got it,\"\nhe said at last.\n\nHalibut looked at him curiously.\n\n\"We must play for first proposal,\" said the Major, firmly.  \"We're pretty\nevenly matched.\"\n\n\"Chess?\" gasped the other, a whole world of protest in his tones.\n\n\"Chess,\" repeated the Major.\n\n\"It is hardly respectful,\" demurred Halibut.  \"What do you think the lady\nwould do if she heard of it?\"\n\n\"Laugh,\" replied the Major, with conviction.\n\n\"I believe she would,\" said the other, brightening.  \"I believe she\nwould.\"\n\n\"You agree, then?\"\n\n\"With conditions.\"\n\n\"Conditions?\"  repeated the Major.\n\n\"One game,\" said Halibut, speaking very slowly and distinctly; \"and if\nthe winner is refused, the loser not to propose until he gives him\npermission.\"\n\n\"What the deuce for?\"  inquired the other, suspiciously.\n\n\"Suppose I win,\" replied Halibut, with suspicious glibness, \"and was so\nupset that I had one of my bilious attacks come on, where should I be?\nWhy, I might have to break off in the middle and go home.  A fellow can't\npropose when everything in the room is going round and round.\"\n\n\"I don't think you ought to contemplate marriage, Halibut,\" remarked the\nMajor, very seriously and gently.\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Halibut, dryly.\n\n\"Very well,\" said the Major, \"I agree to the conditions.  Better come to\nmy place and we'll decide it now.  If we look sharp, the winner may be\nable to know his fate to-day, after all.\"\n\nHalibut assenting, they walked back together.  The feverish joy of the\ngambler showed in the Major's eye as they drew their chairs up to the\nlittle antique chess table and began to place their pieces ready for the\nfray.  Then a thought struck him, and he crossed over to the sideboard.\n\n\"If you're feeling a bit off colour, Halibut,\" he said, kindly, \"you'd\nbetter have a little brandy to pull yourself together.  I don't wish to\ntake a mean advantage.\"\n\n\"You're very good,\" said the other, as he eyed the noble measure of\nliquid poured out by his generous adversary.\n\n\"And now to business,\" said the Major, as he drew himself a little soda\nfrom a siphon.\n\n\"Now to business,\" repeated Halibut, rising and placing his glass on the\nmantel-piece.\n\nThe Major struggled fiercely with his feelings, but, despite himself, a\nguilty blush lent colour to the other's unfounded suspicions.\n\n\"Remember the conditions,\" said Halibut, impressively.\n\n\"Here's my hand on it,\" said the other, reaching over.\n\nHalibut took it, and, his thoughts being at the moment far away, gave it\na tender, respectful squeeze.  The Major stared and coughed.  It was\nsuggestive of practice.\n\nIf the history of the duel is ever written, it will be found not unworthy\nof being reckoned with the most famous combats of ancient times.  Piece\nafter piece was removed from the board, and the Major drank glass after\nglass of soda to cool his heated brain.  At the second glass Halibut took\nan empty tumbler and helped himself.  Suddenly there was a singing in the\nMajor's ears, and a voice, a hateful, triumphant voice, said,\n\n\"Checkmate!\"\n\nThen did his gaze wander from knight to bishop and bishop to castle in a\nvain search for succour.  There was his king defied by a bishop--a bishop\nwhich had been hobnobbing with pawns in one corner of the board, and\nwhich he could have sworn he had captured and removed full twenty minutes\nbefore.  He mentioned this impression to Halibut.\n\n\"That was the other one,\" said his foe.  \"I thought you had forgotten\nthis.  I have been watching and hoping so for the last half-hour.\"\n\nThere was no disguising the coarse satisfaction of the man.  He had\nwatched and hoped.  Not beaten him, so the Major told himself, in fair\nplay, but by taking a mean and pitiful advantage of a pure oversight.  A\nsheer oversight.  He admitted it.\n\nHalibut rose with a sigh of relief, and the Major, mechanically sweeping\nup the pieces, dropped them one by one into the box.\n\n\"Plenty of time,\" said the victor, glancing at the clock.  \"I shall go\nnow, but I should like a wash first.\"\n\nThe Major rose, and in his capacity of host led the way upstairs to his\nroom, and poured fresh water for his foe.  Halibut washed himself\ndelicately, carefully trimming his hair and beard, and anxiously\nconsulting the Major as to the set of his coat in the back, after\nhe had donned it again.\n\nHis toilet completed, he gave a satisfied glance in the glass, and then\nfollowed the man of war sedately down stairs.  At the hall he paused, and\nbusied himself with the clothes-brush and hat-pad, modestly informing his\nglaring friend that he could not afford to throw any chances away, and\nthen took his departure.\n\nThe Major sat up late that night waiting for news, but none came, and by\nbreakfast-time next morning his thirst for information became almost\nuncontrollable.  He toyed with a chop and allowed his coffee to get cold.\nThen he clapped on his hat and set off to Halibut's to know the worst.\n\n\"Well?\" he inquired, as he followed the other into his dining-room.\n\n\"I went,\" said Halibut, waving him to a chair.\n\n\"Am I to congratulate you?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know,\" was the reply; \"perhaps not just yet.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"  said the Major, irascibly.\n\n\"Well, as a matter of fact,\" said Halibut, \"she refused me, but so nicely\nand so gently that I scarcely minded it.  In fact, at first I hardly\nrealized that she had refused me.\"\n\nThe Major rose, and regarding his poor friend kindly, shook and patted\nhim lightly on the shoulder.\n\n\"She's a splendid woman,\" said Halibut.  \"Ornament to her sex,\" remarked\nthe Major.\n\n\"So considerate,\" murmured the bereaved one.\n\n\"Good women always are,\" said the Major, decisively.  \"I don't think I'd\nbetter worry her to-day, Halibut, do you?\"\n\n\"No, I don't,\" said Halibut, stiffly.\n\n\"I'll try my luck to-morrow,\" said the Major.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Halibut.\n\n\"Eh?\"  said the Major, trying to look puzzled.\n\n\"You are forgetting the conditions of the game,\" replied Halibut.  \"You\nhave to obtain my permission first.\"\n\n\"Why, my dear fellow,\" said the Major, with a boisterous laugh.\n\"I wouldn't insult you by questioning your generosity in such a case.\nNo, no, Halibut, old fellow, I know you too well.\"\n\nHe spoke with feeling, but there was an anxious note in his voice.\n\n\"We must abide by the conditions,\" said Halibut, slowly; \"and I must\ninform you, Brill, that I intend to renew the attack myself.\"\n\n\"Then, sir,\" said the Major, fuming, \"you compel me to say--putting all\nmodesty aside--that I believe the reason Mrs. Riddel would have nothing\nto do with you was because she thought somebody else might make a similar\noffer.\"\n\n\"That's what I thought,\" said Halibut, simply; \"but you see now that you\nhave so unaccountably--so far as Mrs. Riddel is concerned--dropped out of\nthe running, perhaps, if I am gently persistent, she'll take me.\"\n\nThe Major rose and glared at him.\n\n\"If you don't take care, old chap,\" said Halibut, tenderly, \"you'll burst\nsomething.\"\n\n\"Gently persistent,\" repeated the Major, staring at him; \"gently\npersistent.\"\n\n\"Remember Bruce and his spider,\" smiled the other.\n\n\"You are not going to propose to that poor woman nine times?\"  roared his\nincensed friend.\n\n\"I hope that it will not be necessary,\" was the reply; \"but if it is, I\ncan assure you, my dear Brill, that I'm not going to be outclassed by a\nmere spider.\"\n\n\"But think of her feelings!\"  gasped the Major.\n\n\"I have,\" was the reply; \"and I'm sure she'll thank me for it afterward.\nYou see, Brill, you and I are the only eligibles in the place, and now\nyou are out of it, she's sure to take me sooner or later.\"\n\n\"And pray how long am I to wait?\"  demanded the Major, controlling\nhimself with difficulty.\n\n\"I can't say,\" said Halibut; \"but I don't think it's any good your\nwaiting at all, because if I see any signs that Mrs. Riddel is waiting\nfor you I may just give her a hint of the hopelessness of it.\"\n\n\"You're a perfect Mephistopheles, sir!\"  bawled the indignant Major.\nHalibut bowed.\n\n\"Strategy, my dear Brill,\" he said, smiling; \"strategy.  Now why waste\nyour time?  Why not make some other woman happy?  Why not try her\ncompanion, Miss Philpotts?  I'm sure any little assistance--\"\n\nThe Major's attitude was so alarming that the sentence was never\nfinished, and a second later the speaker found himself alone, watching\nhis irate friend hurrying frantically down the path, knocking the blooms\noff the geraniums with his cane as he went.  He saw no more of him for\nseveral weeks, the Major preferring to cherish his resentment in the\nprivacy of his house.  The Major also refrained from seeing the widow,\nhaving a wholesome dread as to what effect the contemplation of her\ncharms might have upon his plighted word.\n\nHe met her at last by chance.  Mrs. Riddel bowed coldly and would have\npassed on, but the Major had already stopped, and was making wild and\nunmerited statements about the weather.\n\n\"It is seasonable,\" she said, simply.\n\nThe Major agreed with her, and with a strong-effort regained his\ncomposure.\n\n\"I was just going to turn back,\" he said, untruthfully; \"may I walk with\nyou?\"\n\n\"I am not going far,\" was the reply.\n\nWith soldierly courage the Major took this as permission; with feminine\nprecision Mrs. Riddel walked about fifty yards and then stopped.  \"I told\nyou I wasn't going far,\" she said sweetly, as she held out her hand.\n\"Goodby.\"\n\n\"I wanted to ask you something,\" said the Major, turning with her.  \"I\ncan't think what it was.\n\nThey walked on very slowly, the Major's heart beating rapidly as he told\nhimself that the lady's coldness was due to his neglect of the past few\nweeks, and his wrath against Halibut rose to still greater heights as he\nsaw the cruel position in which that schemer had placed him.  Then he\nmade a sudden resolution.  There was no condition as to secrecy, and,\nfirst turning the conversation on to indoor amusements, he told the\nastonished Mrs. Riddel the full particulars of the fatal game.  Mrs.\nRiddel said that she would never forgive them; it was the most\npreposterous thing she had ever heard of.  And she demanded hotly whether\nshe was to spend the rest of her life in refusing Mr. Halibut.\n\n\"Do you play high as a rule?\" she inquired, scornfully.\n\n\"Sixpence a game,\" replied the Major, simply.\n\nThe corners of Mrs. Riddel's mouth relaxed, and her fine eyes began to\nwater; then she turned her head away and laughed.  \"It was very foolish\nof us, I admit,\" said the Major, ruefully, \"and very wrong.  I shouldn't\nhave told you, only I couldn't explain my apparent neglect without.\"\n\n\"Apparent neglect?\"  repeated the widow, somewhat haughtily.\n\n\"Well, put it down to a guilty conscience,\" said the Major; \"it seems\nyears to me since I have seen you.\"\n\n\"Remember the conditions, Major Brill,\" said Mrs. Riddel, with severity.\n\n\"I shall not transgress them,\" replied the Major, seriously.\n\nMrs. Riddel gave her head a toss, and regarded him from the corner of her\neyes.\n\n\"I am very angry with you, indeed,\" she said, severely.  The Major\napologized again.  \"For losing,\" added the lady, looking straight before\nher.\n\nMajor Brill caught his breath and his knees trembled beneath him.  He\nmade a half-hearted attempt to seize her hand, and then remembering his\nposition, sighed deeply and looked straight before him.  They walked on\nin silence.\n\n\"I think,\" said his companion at last, \"that, if you like, you can get\nback at cribbage what you lost at chess.  That is, of course, if you\nreally want to.\"\n\n\"He wouldn't play,\" said the Major, shaking his head.\n\n\"No, but I will,\" said Mrs. Riddel, with a smile.  \"I think I've got a\nplan.\"\n\nShe blushed charmingly, and then, in modest alarm at her boldness,\ndropped her voice almost to a whisper.  The Major gazed at her in\nspeechless admiration and threw back his head in ecstasy.  \"Come round\nto-morrow afternoon,\" said Mrs. Riddel, pausing at the end of the lane.\n\"Mr. Halibut shall be there, too, and it shall be done under his very\neyes.\"\n\nUntil that time came the Major sat at home carefully rehearsing his part,\nand it was with an air of complacent virtue that he met the somewhat\nastonished gaze of the persistent Halibut next day.  It was a bright\nafternoon, but they sat indoors, and Mrs. Riddel, after an animated\ndescription of a game at cribbage with Miss Philpotts the night before,\ngot the cards out and challenged Halibut to a game.\n\nThey played two, both of which the diplomatic Halibut lost; then Mrs.\nRiddel, dismissing him as incompetent, sat drumming on the table with her\nfingers, and at length challenged the Major.  She lost the first game\neasily, and began the second badly.  Finally, after hastily glancing at a\nnew hand, she flung the cards petulantly on the table, face downward.\n\n\"Would you like my hand, Major Brill?\"  she demanded, with a blush.\n\n\"Better than anything in the world,\" cried the Major, eagerly.\n\nHalibut started, and Miss Philpotts nearly had an accident with her\ncrochet hook.  The only person who kept cool was Mrs. Riddel, and it was\nquite clear to the beholders that she had realized neither the ambiguity\nof her question nor the meaning of her opponent's reply.\n\n\"Well, you may have it,\" she said, brightly.\n\nBefore Miss Philpotts could lay down her work, before Mr. Halibut could\ninterpose, the Major took possession of Mrs. Riddel's small white hand\nand raised it gallantly to his lips.  Mrs. Riddel, with a faint scream\nwhich was a perfect revelation to the companion, snatched her hand away.\n\"I meant my hand of cards,\" she said, breathlessly.\n\n\"Really, Brill, really,\" said Halibut, stepping forward fussily.\n\n\"Oh!\"  said the Major, blankly; \"cards!\"\n\n\"That's what I meant, of course,\" said Mrs. Riddel, recovering herself\nwith a laugh.  \"I had no idea  still--if you prefer----\"  The Major took\nher hand again, and Miss Philpotts set Mr. Halibut an example--which he\ndid not follow--by gazing meditatively out of the window.  Finally she\ngathered up her work and quitted the room.  Mrs. Riddel smiled over at\nMr. Halibut and nodded toward the Major.\n\n\"Don't you think Major Brill is somewhat hasty in his conclusions?\"  she\ninquired, softly.\n\n\"I'll tell Major Brill what I think of him when I get him alone,\" said\nthe injured gentleman, sourly.",
