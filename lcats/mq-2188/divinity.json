    "body": "Bradley seemed to have escaped regeneration. Now he had only death to\nworry about.\n\nTen minutes before, he had been tumbling through the air head over\nheels, helpless and despairing. And before that--\n\nHe remembered how his heart had been in his mouth as he had crept down\nthe corridor of the speeding ship. He could hear Malevski's voice coming\nfaintly through one of the walls, and had been tempted to run back,\nfearful of being shot down on the spot if he were caught. He had fought\nback the temptation and kept on. No one had seen him as he crept into\nthe lifeboat.\n\n\"This is your one chance,\" he told himself. \"You have to take it. If\nthey get you back to port, you're finished.\"\n\nLuck had been with him. They were broadcasting the results of the\nMars-Earth matches at the time, and most of the crew were grouped around\nthe visors. He had picked the moment when news came of a sensational\nupset, and for a minute or two after the lifeboat blasted off, no one\nrealized what had happened. When the truth did penetrate, they had a\nhard time swinging the ship around, and by then the lifeboat was out of\nradar range. He was free.\n\nHe had exulted wildly for a moment, until it struck him that freedom in\nspace might be a doubtful gift. He would have to get to some civilized\nport, convince the port authorities that he had been shipwrecked and\nsomehow separated from the other crew members, and then lose himself\nquickly in the crowd of people that he hoped would fill the place. There\nwould be risks, but he would take them. It would be better than running\nout of air and food in space.\n\nIt had been the best possible plan, and it had gone wrong, all wrong. He\nhad been caught, before he knew it, in the gravity of a planet he had\noverlooked. The lifeboat had torn apart under the combined stresses of\nits forward momentum and its side rockets blasting full force, and he\nhad been hurled free in his space suit, falling slowly at first, then\nfaster, faster, faster--\n\nThe automatic parachutes had suddenly sprung into operation when he\nreached a critical speed, and he had slowed down and stopped tumbling.\nHe fell more gently, feet first, and when he landed it was with a shock\nthat jarred but did no real damage.\n\n\n\nSlowly he picked himself up and fumbled at the air valve. Something in\nthe intake tubes had jammed under the shock of landing, and the air was\nno longer circulating properly. Filled with the moisture of his own\nbreath, it felt hot and clammy, and clouded the viewplates.\n\nIf he had kept all his wits about him he would have tried to remember,\nbefore he took a chance, whether the planet had an oxygen atmosphere,\nand whether the oxygen was of sufficient concentration to support human\nlife. Not that he had any real choice, but it would have been good to\nknow. As it was, he turned the air valve automatically, and listened\nnervously as the stale air hissed out and the fresh air hissed in.\n\nHe took a deep breath. It didn't kill him. Instead, it sent his blood\nracing around with new energy. Slowly the moisture evaporated from his\nviewplates. Slowly he began to see.\n\nHe perceived that he was not alone. A group of people stood in front of\nhim, respectful, their own eyes full of fear and wonder. Some one\nuttered a hoarse cry and pointed at his helmet. The unclouding of the\nviewplates must have stricken them with awe.\n\nThe air was wonderful to breathe. He would have liked to remove his\nhelmet and fill his lungs with it unhampered, expose his face to its\nsoft caress, expand his chest with the constriction of the suit. But\nthese people--\n\nThey must have seen him tumble down from the sky and land unhurt. They\ncarried food and flowers, and now they were kneeling down to him as to\na--Suddenly he realized. To them he was a god.\n\nThe thought of it made him weak. To Malevski and the ship's crew he was\na criminal, a cheap chiseler and pickpocket, almost a murderer, escaping\ncredit for _that_ crime only by grace of his own good luck and his\nvictim's thick skull. They had felt such contempt for him that they\nhadn't even bothered to guard him too carefully. They had thought him a\ncomplete coward, without the courage to risk an escape, without the\nintelligence to find the opportunities that might be offered to him.\n\nThey hadn't realized how terrified he was of the thing with which they\nthreatened him. Regeneration, the giving up of his old identity? Not for\nhim. They hadn't realized that he preferred the risks of a dangerous\nescape to the certainty of _that_.\n\nAnd here he was a god.\n\n\n\nHe lifted his hand without thinking, to wipe away the perspiration that\ncovered his forehead. But before the hand touched his helmet he realized\nwhat he was doing, and let the hand drop again.\n\nTo the people watching him the gesture must have seemed one of double\nsignificance. It was at once a sign of acceptance of their food and\nflowers, and their offer of good-will, and at the same time an order to\nwithdraw. They bowed, and moved backwards away from him. Behind him they\nleft their gifts.\n\nThey seemed human, human enough for the features on the men's faces to\nimpress him as strong and resourceful, for him to recognize that the\nwomen were attractive. And if they were human, the food must be fit for\nhuman beings. Whether it was or wasn't, however, again he had no choice.\n\nHe waited until they were out of sight, and then, stiffly, he removed\nhis helmet and ate. The food tasted good. And with his helmet off, with\nthe wind on his face, and the woods around him whispering in his ears,\nit was a meal fit for the being they thought him to be.\n\nHe was a god. Possibly it was the space suit which made him one,\nespecially the goggle-eyed helmet. He could take no chance of becoming\nan ordinary mortal, and that would mean that he would have to wear the\nspace suit continually. Or at least the helmet. That, he decided, was\nwhat he would do. That would leave his body reasonably free, and at the\nsame time impress them with the fact that he was different from them.\n\nBy manipulating the air valve he would be able to make the viewplates\ncloud and uncloud at will, thus giving dramatic expression to his\nfeelings. It would be a pleasant game to play until he had learned\nsomething of their language. It would be safer than trying to make\nthings clear to them with speech and gestures that they could not\nunderstand anyway.\n\nHe wondered how long it would be before Malevski would find the\nshattered lifeboat drifting in space, and then trace its course and\ndecide where he had landed. That would be the end of his divinity.\nMeanwhile, until then--\n\nUntil then he was a god. Unregenerated. Permanently unregenerated.\nHolding his helmet, he threw back his head and laughed loud and long,\nand wondered what his mother would have thought.\n\n\n\nFor awhile he was being left alone. They were afraid of him, of course,\nfearful of intruding with their merely mortal affairs upon the\nmeditations of so divine a being. Later, however, curiosity and perhaps\na desire to show him off to newcomers might draw them back. In the\ninterval, it would be well to find out what sort of place this was in\nwhich he had landed.\n\nHe looked around him. There were trees, with sharp green branches, sharp\ngreen twigs, sharp red leaves. He shuddered as he thought of what would\nhave happened to him if he had fallen on the point of a branch. The\ntrees seemed rigid and unbending in the wind that caressed his face.\nThere were no birds that he could see. Small black objects bounded from\none branch to another as if engaged in complicated games of tag. He\nwondered if the games were as serious as the one he had been playing\nwith Malevski, with himself as It.\n\n\n\nThere were no ground animals in sight. If any showed up later, they\ncouldn't be too dangerous, not with the natives living here in such\napparent peace and contentment. There probably wouldn't be anything that\nhis pocket gun, which he had taken the precaution to remove from the\nlifeboat before that shattered, wouldn't be able to handle.\n\nNear him was a strange spring, or little river, or whatever you might\ncall it. It broke from the ground, ran along the hard rocky surface for\na dozen feet, and then plunged underground again. There were other\nsprings of a similar nature scattered here and there, and now he\nrealized that their combined murmuring was the noise he had mistaken, on\nfirst removing his helmet, for the rustle of the wind in the woods.\n\nHe would have enough to drink. The natives would bring him food. What\nelse could any reasonable man want?\n\nIt wasn't the kind of life he had dreamed of. No Martian whiskey, no\ndrugs, no night spots, no bigtime gamblers slapping him on the back and\ncalling him \"pal,\" no brassy blondes giving him the eye. Still, it was\nbetter than the life he had actually lived, much better. It would do, it\nwould have to do.\n\n\n\nFrom what he had seen of the natives, he liked them--and feared them.\nFor all their mistaken faith in him, they seemed to be no fools. How\nmany times before had men from some supposedly superior civilization\ndropped in upon the people of a new world and made that first impression\nof divinity, only to have the original attitude of worship by the\nnatives give way to disillusion and contempt? Who was that fellow they\ntold about in the history books he had read as a kid? Cortez, way back\non Earth, when that planet itself had offered unexplored territory. And\nlater on it had happened on one of the moons of Jupiter, and on several\nplanets outside the System. The explorers had been gods, until they had\nbeen found out. Then they had been savage murderers, plunderers, devils.\n\nIt would be too bad if he were found out. He was one against them all,\nhe would never be able to fight off so many enemies. More than that, he\nwas a stranger here, he needed friends. No, he mustn't be found out.\n\n\"Better put on your helmet, dope,\" he told himself savagely. \"They'll be\ncoming back soon, and if they find you without it--\" He put on his\nhelmet, still muttering to himself. It wouldn't make any difference if\nhe were overheard. They didn't know Earth language and would take his\nwords for oracular utterances. He could talk to himself all he wanted,\nand from the looks of things, there would be no one to understand him.\nHe hoped he didn't grow crazy and eccentric, like those hermits who had\nbeen lost alone in space for too many years.\n\nThe helmet was the first nuisance. There would be others too. He\ncouldn't even talk in what had become his natural manner, with a whine\nin every word, a whine that came from being treated with contempt by\npolice and fellow-criminals alike. A god had to speak with slow gravity,\nwith dignity. A god had to walk like a god. A god had endless\nresponsibilities here, it seemed.\n\nHe thought again of his mother. Ever since he could remember, it had\nbeen, \"Georgie, wipe your nose!\" and, \"Georgie, keep your fingers out of\nthe cake!\" and Georgie do this and _don't_ do that. A fine way to speak\nto a god. Even after he had grown up, his mother had continued to treat\nhim like a baby. She had never got over examining his face and his ears\nand his fingernails to make sure that he had cleaned them properly. He\ncouldn't so much as comb his hair to suit her; all through his abortive\nattempt at college, and later at a job, she had done it for him.\n\nBut she had been a lioness in his defense later on, when he had given\nway to that first irresistible impulse to dip his fingers in the till\nand get away with what he thought would be unnoticed petty cash. It had\nbeen her fault that the thing had happened, of course. She could have\ngiven him a decent amount of spending money, instead of doling it out to\nhim from his own wages as if she were giving money for candy to a\nschoolboy. She could have treated him more like the man he was supposed\nto be.\n\nStill, he couldn't complain. She had stuck to him all the way through,\nwhatever the charges against him. When that lug of a traveling salesman\nhad accused her Georgie of picking his pockets, and that female refugee\nfrom a TV studio had charged poor harmless Georgie with slugging her, it\nwas his mother who had stood up in court and denounced them, and\nsolemnly told judge and jury what a sweet, kind, helplessly innocent\nlamb her Georgie was. It wasn't her fault if no one had quite believed\nher.\n\nNow he was on his own, without any possibility of help from her. And in\nwhat the ads called a \"responsible position\" that she had never so much\nas dreamed he could fill.\n\nUnfortunately, now that he had reached so exalted a level, there seemed\nto be few possibilities of promotion. There appeared only the chance, on\nthe one hand, that the natives would find him out and slaughter him, and\non the other that Malevski would track him down and bring him back to\nEarth for the punishment he dreaded.\n\n\n\nIt was a good thing he had put on his helmet. Not far away, a group of\nthe natives was approaching, laden with more food and flowers. It was\nlarger than the previous group. Evidently, as he had anticipated, they\nwere showing him off to newcomers.\n\nHe came to a stately halt and waited for them to approach. He could see\nthe surprise on their faces as they noted his change of costume, and he\nwatched nervously as they stopped to whisper among themselves. It would\nbe too bad for him if they didn't like it.\n\nBut they didn't seem to mind. One of them, a very impressive old man\nwith green hair flecked with red, stepped in front of the others and\nmade a speech, a melodious speech full of liquid sounds that were\nneither quite vowels nor consonants. He didn't have the slightest idea\nof what the individual words meant. But the significance of the speech\nas a whole was clear enough. As it came to an end, they presented him\nwith more food and flowers.\n\nBradley cleared his throat. And then, with as deep and impressive a\nvoice as he could manage, he said, \"Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me\ngreat pleasure to accept your nomination. I promise you that if elected\nI shall keep none of my promises.\"\n\nIt was his first speech to them, and he enjoyed making it so much that\nevery time he saw them during the next few days--they settled down to\ncoming twice a day, morning and night--he made it again, with\nvariations, listing the wonderful things he would do for them if elected\nto the office.\n\nAfter awhile, as he began to enjoy the ceremony for its own sake, he\ndidn't mind at all putting the helmet on for two short periods every\nday. Having so little contact with them, he could learn their language\nonly very slowly. He could distinguish the word for flowers from that\nfor food, although he himself could pronounce neither. He knew the names\nof a few plants, a few parts of the body. And he learned a few names of\npeople. The red-green haired old man was, as close as he could make the\nsounds, Yanyoo. He took the trouble to notice that the prettiest girl\nwas Aoooya.\n\n\n\nAt first everything had been exceedingly peaceful. But about a week\nafter his arrival--he couldn't be sure exactly how many days had passed,\nbecause he hadn't kept count--he learned of some of the dangers they\nfaced.\n\nIt was while they were holding the morning ceremony that the thing came\nout of the forest. At first he thought that a tree had moved. It was\ngreen, with reddish blotches like clusters of needle leaves, and it\nseemed to ooze forward toward them from among the trees. Aoooya noticed\nit first, and pointed and screamed. It was the size of a tiger, thought\nBradley, and might be even more dangerous. He had difficulty keeping\nhis eyes on the rapidly moving creature through the goggles of his\nhelmet. He was aware of gleaming eyes, of two rows of dull green teeth,\nand of muscles that rippled under the green fur.\n\nSeveral of the men had little blowpipes, through which they released a\nshower of darts. But the darts bounced off the fur, and the thing came\non. Bradley fumbled for his gun, and almost dropped it in his\nexcitement. When he finally brought it up into aiming position, his hand\nwas trembling, and his finger could hardly catch the trigger.\n\nThe thing leaped into the air at the old man, Yanyoo, just as the gun\nwent off. The body vaporized first, leaving for a fraction of a second\nthe fierce head and the powerful legs apparently supporting themselves\nin the air. Then part of the head went, and the rest fell to the ground.\nBut sheer momentum carried the green smoky vapor on, so that it\nsurrounded first the old man, then several of the girls, and after them,\nBradley himself. They were all yelling, all but Bradley, who put away\nhis gun and muttered to himself in relief, and then the wind began to\ndissipate the vapor, and on the ground there was left only part of a\nhead and six torn legs.\n\nThey were bowing to him and raising their voices high in thanks. It was\neasy, thought Bradley. Really, it was a cinch to be a god. The beasts\nthat were such great dangers to them were mere trifles to him. To him,\nwith a gun loaded with a thousand thermal charges each of which was\ncapable of blasting armor plate. The thing wouldn't even have come close\nif he himself hadn't been such a timid, cowardly fool. Put Malevski in\nhis place, and the detective would have got the creature as it came out\nof the trees. He wasn't Malevski.\n\nIt was a good thing for him that they couldn't know that. Now his\nposition was completely secure. Now he could relax and enjoy his divine\nlife.\n\nHe didn't realize that a much greater danger was yet to come. He found\nthat out after the evening ceremony.\n\n\n\nThe group that came to see him this time was bigger than ever.\nEvidently, to honor him they had dropped all other work. Yanyoo seemed\nto have constituted himself Bradley's priest. He made a tremendously\nlong and rhapsodic-sounding speech, but at the end there was no donation\nof the usual food and flowers. Instead, Yanyoo backed away, all the\nothers doing the same, and looking at Bradley as if expecting him to\nfollow them.\n\nHe followed. In this manner, with his worshippers walking respectfully\nbackwards, they arrived at what seemed to Bradley to be an ordinary\nsmall hut. Outside the hut was what he took for a curiously shaped log\nof wood. The inside of the hut was in shadow, but as his eyes became\naccustomed to the dimness, he saw something in one corner. It was a\nweird-looking head, also of wood.\n\nIt struck him then. The log of wood had been the old god, good enough to\nworship until he had come along and shown them what a god could really\ndo. Now it had been contemptuously deposed and decapitated. The hut was\na shrine. It was all his.\n\nHe _had_ been promoted after all. The thought didn't please him in the\nleast. Suppose _he_ failed them too--and that was very possible, for he\nhad no idea of what miracles they expected of him. Then he would be\ndeposed and--he gagged at the thought, but he knew that he had to finish\nit--decapitated.\n\nBut for the moment there was no thought of deposing him. The gifts they\noffered were more lavish than ever. And in addition to the food and\nflowers, there was something new. A jug, filled with a warm,\nsweetish-smelling liquid. He could get the odor faintly through the\nintake valve of his helmet. Later on, when his worshippers were gone and\nhe had his helmet off, he realized that it smelled up the entire hut.\n\nIt couldn't be harmful. Nothing that they had offered him so far was\nharmful. He took a sip--and sighed with content. This was one of the few\nthings he had been lacking. There was alcohol, and there were flavors\nand essences that reminded him of the drinks he had encountered on a\ndozen planets. But this was first class stuff, not diluted or\nadulterated with the thousand and one synthetics that were put in to\nstretch a good thing as far as it could go.\n\nWithout realizing the danger, he downed the entire contents of the jug.\n\n\n\nHe felt good. He hadn't felt so good in years, not since his mother had\nmade him a special cake for his birthday when he was--let me see now,\nwas it eight or nine? No matter, it had been many years ago, and the\noccasion had been notable for the fact that she had let him drink some\nof the older people's punch, made with a tiny bit of some alcoholic\ndrink. He felt _very_ good. He picked up his helmet and put it on his\nhead, and stuck the stem of a green flower rakishly through the exit\nvalve of the helmet, so that the flower seemed to dance every time he\nexhaled, and staggered out of his hut.\n\nHe was fortunate that it was dark. \"I'm drunk,\" he told himself. \"Never\nbeen so drunk in my life. Never felt so good. Mother never felt so good.\nMalevski never felt so good.\"\n\nHe passed a shadowy figure in the dark and said, \"Hiya, friend and\nworshipper. Ever see a god drunk before?\"\n\nThe figure bowed, and kept its head lowered until he had moved on.\n\n\"Drunk or sober, I'm shtill divine,\" he said proudly. And he began to\nsing, loudly and impressively, his voice orchestral in his own ears\nwithin the confines of the helmet. \"Ould Lang Shyne, she ain't what she\nushed to be, ain't what she ushed to be--\" The words came easily, and as\nit seemed, naturally to his lips.\n\nAfter awhile, however, he tired of them. After awhile he found that his\nlegs had tired of them. He sat down with a thump under a spiky tree and\nsaid solemnly, \"Never felt so good in my life. Never felt so happy--it's\na lie. I don't feel good.\"\n\nHe didn't, not any more. He felt sick to his stomach. A touch of sober\nthought had corroded the happiness of his intoxication, and he was sick\nand afraid. Today their god was a hero, today they would forgive him\neverything. But did they actually _prefer_ a drunken god? No.\nDrunkenness made a god human, all too human. A drunken god was a weak\ngod, and his hold on his worshippers was their belief in his strength.\nAs he valued his life, he must get drunk no more.\n\n\"Ain't gonna get drunk no more, no more,\" he sang sadly and solemnly to\nhimself, and finally he fell asleep.\n\n\n\nHe awoke with a hangover and a memory. He was not one of those men who\nwhen sober forget all they have done when drunk. He remembered\neverything. And he knew that he must put drunkenness away from him.\n\nThat morning they brought him only food and flowers. But at the evening\nceremony they presented him once more with a jug of liquor as an\nadditional reward for his destruction of the deadly beast. For the first\ntime, Bradley took an active part in the ceremony. He held up the jug\nand said in grave tones, \"In the name of Carrie Nation, I renounce thee\nand all thy works.\"\n\nThen he poured out the liquor and smashed the jug on the ground.\n\nAfter that, the smashing of the jug was part of the ceremony of\nworshipping him. It left him unhappy at first, but sober. After awhile,\nthe unhappiness disappeared, but the soberness remained. From now on, he\nwould act as a god should act.\n\nThe natives were not stupid, he saw that very clearly. The first jugs\nthey had offered him had been beautiful objects, of excellent\nworkmanship. But when they perceived that the only use he had for them\nwas to break them, the quality deteriorated rapidly. Now the jugs they\nbrought him were crude things indeed, made for the sole purpose of being\nsmashed. He wondered how many other tribes had tricked their gods\nsimilarly.\n\nNo, they were not at all stupid. It struck him that with such advantages\nof civilization as he himself had enjoyed, they would have gone much\nfurther than he did. Two weeks or so after he had come down from the sky\nto be their god, he saw that they had learned from him. One of the young\nmen appeared during the day wearing a wooden helmet. It was a helmet\nobviously patterned after his own, although it had no glass or plastic,\nand the openings in front of the eyes were left blank. The mythical\nEarth-hero, Prometheus, had brought fire down from the skies. He had\nbrought the Helmet. He was Bradley, the Helmet-Bringer.\n\nEven at that he had underestimated his worshippers. He had thought at\nfirst that the helmets were meant merely for ornament and decoration. He\nlearned better one day when a swarm of creatures like flying lizards\nswept down out of a group of trees in a fierce attack. He had not known\nthat such creatures existed here, and now that he saw them, he realized\nhow fortunate it was that they were not more numerous. They had sharp\nteeth and sharper claws, and they tore at his head with a ferocity that\nstruck fear into his heart. His gun was of less use than usual against\nthem. He could catch one or two, but the others moved too swiftly for\nhim to aim.\n\nBy this time, others of the natives wore wooden helmets, and he could\nsee how the sharp claws ripped splinter after splinter from them. But\nthe birds or lizards, or whatever they were, didn't go unscathed. From a\nsort of skin bellows, several of the natives blew a gray mist at them,\nand where the mist made contact with the leather skin, the flying\ncreatures seemed to be paralyzed in mid-flight, and they fell to the\nground, where they were easily crushed to death. By the time they had\ngiven up the fight and fled, half a dozen of them were lying dead.\n\nThey were evidently useless for food because of the poison they\ncontained. He was surprised to see, however, that the natives still had\na use for them. They dragged the dead creatures into a field of growing\ncrops, and left them there to rot into fertilizer.\n\nBut such incidents as this, he found, were to be rare. For the most\npart, the life here was peaceful, and he found himself liking it more\nand more. Now, without laughter, he wondered again what his mother would\nhave thought of him.\n\nShe would have been proud. He realized now that she had done her best\nfor him. And when every one else had given up hope for him, she had not.\nPerhaps she had protected him too much--but she had early learned the\nneed for protection. He could look at her now in a new light. Her own\nfather had died early in life, and then her husband soon after her son\nhad been born. She had faced a tough fight, and had thought to spare him\nwhat she herself had gone through. Too bad she hadn't realized exactly\nwhat she was doing. She was bringing him up with the ability, as the old\nepigram had it, to resist everything but temptation.\n\nThe temptation to steal that petty cash, to put his hands into a drunk's\npocket and lift the man's wallet, to lie to a pretty girl, to slug a\nhelpless victim--he had resisted none of them. He had resisted nothing\nuntil that day he had poured the jugful of liquor on the ground and\nsmashed the jug itself.\n\nBut could he blame his mother for all that? It had all been his own\nfault.\n\n\n\nAnd it would be his own fault if he failed to resist the new temptation\nthat now reared its pretty head--Aoooya. She had taken to coming to his\nhut-shrine for a private little ceremony of her own. You might almost\nhave thought that she had fallen in love with him as an individual. He\nwondered whether she had been impressed by his helmet. Did she take that\nto be his actual head? No, of course not. They had made helmets for\nthemselves, therefore they knew that the thing he wore was also a\nhelmet. Perhaps they knew more about him than he thought.\n\nBut they continued to worship him, that was the main thing. And Aoooya\nbrought him, every day, little presents, special flowers and food\ndelicacies, that argued a personal affection.\n\nThis was a danger that he recognized from the beginning. Perhaps a god\n_might_ fall in love with a mortal without losing his godliness.\nPerhaps. It had happened before. But, however the rest of the tribe\nmight react to the idea, Bradley had noticed one young man who liked to\nstay near the girl, and he knew that this rival wouldn't take kindly to\nit at all. He might resent the god's behavior. And what happened when\nthese people didn't like the way a god behaved? Why, they struck his\nhead off.\n\nThe god might act first, of course. The young man wouldn't stand a\nchance against him if he used his gun. In fact, Bradley could blast the\nother man unobserved, make him disappear into vapor, without leaving any\ntraces of how he died. That was murder, but if a god couldn't get away\nwith murder, what sort of god was he? A pretty poor, cheap sort indeed.\nYes, he could make his own rules.\n\nAnd he could go on, maintaining his godhood by little murders of that\nsort, and other deadly miracles, until they hated him more than they\nloved him. That would follow inevitably. And then, when they all hated\nhim, not even his gun would save him. Then--\n\n\"You're a liar,\" he told himself fiercely. \"That isn't the thing you're\nafraid of. Your weakness is that you don't have a murderous nature. You\ncould kill one or two of them and get away with it, and you'd be able to\ncontrol yourself and kill no more. That time you hit the man over the\nhead, you didn't intend to kill him either. You were more frightened, at\nfirst, anyway, by the thought that you might have killed him, than by\nthe danger of being caught. You were overjoyed when he lived.\n\n\"You hate to kill, that's your trouble. You've had a sense of\nresponsibility all along, but it never had a chance to develop. Now it's\ndeveloped. You feel responsible for these people, for Aoooya and for the\nrest of them. That's why you can't take advantage of them. You've been\nposing as a rebel all your life, and you're just a respectable,\nlaw-abiding citizen at heart.\"\n\nHe winced at the thought. His own society had never accepted him at his\nown valuation. This one took him for a much greater being than he took\nhimself, and there seemed to be nothing to do but to live up to what he\nwas expected to be.\n\n\n\nAll the same, Aoooya continued to be a tempting morsel, and sooner or\nlater, he feared, he would not be able to resist her. And then the\nplanet itself provided a diversion.\n\nThey had never seen such a thing and had no idea of what it presaged,\nbut he knew. He had heard of it on Earth and on Venus, and he had seen\nit on other planets where the rock formations had not yet settled down.\nA little hollow appeared first in the ground, and then the hollow was\npushed out and suddenly blown into the air. Steam whistled through the\nnewly made vent, a shower of steam and hot dust and red hot fragments of\nrock. Slowly the vent grew, until the cloud from the terrifying geyser\ndarkened the sky and spread panic through the tribe.\n\nHe knew what would happen next. They were running around in terror, but\nnot for one moment was he himself in doubt. He donned his complete space\nsuit, in order to impress them the more, then stalked into the middle of\nthem, and said, \"Pick up all your possessions and follow me.\"\n\nThey stared at him, and he showed them what he meant by picking up the\nbelongings of one household in his gloved hands, and handing them to a\nwaiting woman. Then, when they had grasped the idea and were gathering\nall they owned, he led them toward the safety of the trees. Five minutes\nafter they had set off, the lava began to flow from the new-born\nvolcano, scorching the ground for a hundred yards around, sparks smoking\nand smoldering in the treetops.\n\nThe head start he had given them was enough to help them escape the\nresultant forest fire. All that day they traveled, until finally they\ncame to a forest which couldn't burn, and here they rested. And here\nthey settled down to build their lives anew.\n\nIt must have been a comfort to know that a god had led them to safety\nand was helping them make the new start. Bradley helped them with his\ngun, which blasted dangerous beasts, and even more with his slightly\nsuperior knowledge. He showed them how to fashion tools from stone and\nhow to use these to build better huts. He taught them how to make swords\nand other weapons, so that henceforth they wouldn't be forced to rely\nfor defense on poison alone. He was the most industrious god since\nVulcan. And in helping them he found that he had no time for Aoooya.\n\nCame the day when the new village settled down to its changed routine of\nlife. The morning ceremony before his new shrine had just been\ncompleted, but Bradley was not satisfied. Something was wrong. Yanyoo's\ndemeanor, Aoooya's--\n\nWith a shock, Bradley realized what it was. From old Yanyoo down the\nline, none of the natives seemed to have their original fear of him.\nThere was respect, there was affection, certainly, but the respect and\naffection were those due an older brother rather than a god.\n\nAnd he was not displeased. Being a god had been a wearying business.\nBeing a friend might be a great deal more pleasant. Yes, the change was\nsomething to be happy about.\n\n\n\nBut he had little time to be happy. For that same morning, there came\nwhat he had so long dreaded. Out of a clear, shipless sky, Malevski\nappeared, strolling toward him as casually as if he had been there all\nalong, and said, \"Nice little ceremony you have here.\"\n\n\"Hello, Malevski. Don't give me the credit. They thought it up.\"\n\n\"Ingenious. Almost as ingenious as the way they've used the help you\ngave them. We had this tribe listed long ago as a very capable one, far\nbehind the rest of its System in development, it's true, but only\nbecause it had started late up the evolutionary ladder. It had been\ndoing very nicely on its own, and we didn't want to interfere unless we\ncould give it some real help.\n\n\"I'll admit that I had a few qualms at first, when we traced you here\nand learned that you had landed among them. But we've been observing you\nfor the past day and a half--our space ship landed beyond that burned\nout stretch of ground, not too close to that volcano--and I'll have to\nadmit that, judging from your past record, I didn't think you had it in\nyou.\"\n\n\"I suppose that's over with now,\" said Bradley.\n\n\"Yes, you're finished with being a god. We don't believe in kidding the\nnatives, Bradley!\"\n\nBradley nodded ruefully. \"They don't seem to believe in it, either. I\nguess they found out I wasn't a god before I did. But it didn't seem to\nmatter to them.\" He sighed, and turned toward the new village. \"Do you\nmind, if I sort of--well, hold a farewell ceremony before we go? They\nwon't understand, but they'll feel better than if I just go off....\"\n\nMalevski shook his head firmly. \"No, no time for that. I'll have to get\nout a full report, and we're in a hurry to get off. Any word you'd like\nto have sent out to your mother, Bradley, before we blast?\"\n\n\n\nBradley looked back again, and his shoulders came up more firmly. He'd\ntaught his people here, and led them; but he'd learned a few things\nhimself--he'd found he could take what was necessary. He'd found that\nthe easiest way wasn't always the best, that getting drunk was no way\nout, and that real friendship and respect meant more than the words of\nbig-shots. Maybe he'd learned enough to be able to take regeneration....\n\nHe managed to grin, a little lopsidedly, at Malevski. \"Yeah. You might\nsend her a message. Tell her I'm fine, and that I've learned to wipe my\nown nose. I think she'll be glad to hear that.\"\n\n\"She will,\" Malevski told him. \"When she hears that you're Provisional\nGovernor of this planet, she'll even believe it.\"\n\n\"Provisional Governor?\" Bradley stood with his mouth open, staring. He\nshook his head. \"But what about regeneration...?\"\n\nMalevski laughed. \"You're appointed, on the basis of my first report\nabout what you're doing here, Bradley,\" he answered. \"As to regeneration\n... well, you think about it, while we bring in the supplies we're\nsupposed to leave for you, before we blast out of here.\"\n\nHe went off, chuckling, towards his ship, leaving Bradley to puzzle over\nit.\n\nThen, just as Malevski disappeared, he understood. Damn it, they'd\ntricked him! They'd left him here where he had to be a god and assume\nthe responsibilities of a god. And through that, he'd been\nregenerated--completely, thoroughly regenerated!\n\nSuddenly, he was chuckling as hard as Malevski as he swung around and\nwent back to face his former worshippers. And they were coming forward\nto meet him, their friendly smiles matching his own.\n\n",
