This conceals\nthe box until it is needed, and affords opportunity for the characters\nto make the necessary changes in their costumes. One side of the box,\nalso the top are removed, so that the characters may enter the box\nthrough the top, using a small stepladder if necessary, and come out\nagain quickly, being enabled to change their costumes and receive the\nnecessary accessories through the side which has been removed. It is\nimportant that everything necessary for the change of costume should\nbe in readiness. In the case of the Pullman porter it will be found\nadvisable to substitute for \u201cRastus,\u201d a boy costumed in exactly the\nsame manner but with face unblackened.\n\n\nCOPYRIGHT NOTICE.\n\nWARNING.\n\nPERMISSION FOR PUBLIC PERFORMANCE.\n\nAccording to the provisions of the Copyright Act of July, 1909, the\nowner of the Copyright \u201cshall have the exclusive right to print,\nreprint, publish, copy and vend the Copyright work.\u201d\n\nThe purchase of this copy or of any number of copies does not carry\nwith it the right of Public Performance for any purpose whatever,\nbut the Owners of the Copyright hereby grant permission for Public\nPerformance to any bona fide purchaser of ten or more copies who shall\nin good faith make such a purchase for the purpose herein stated.\n\nPerformance from borrowed or rented copies is not permitted.\n\n                                   HALL-MACK COMPANY,\n                                         Owners of the Copyright.\n\n\n  Copyright, MCMXV, by HALL-MACK CO., International Copyright secured.\n\n\n\n\nThe Inventor\n\n\n\n\nACT I.\n\n\n(Curtain rises. Aunt Susan seated near table with knitting in hand.)\n\nAUNT SUSAN (laying down knitting).\u2014Dear, dear, it\u2019s snowing still. This\nwill certainly be a white Christmas. (Resumes work.) I must hurry and\nfinish this sock for Abner. He\u2019s been such a faithful hired boy, and I\ndon\u2019t know of a thing that would please him better for Christmas than a\npair of nice red socks. (Holds them up to view.) (Knits a few moments.)\nThey\u2019re finished now, and I know he\u2019ll be plumb tickled. He did say\nsomethin\u2019 about a baseball an\u2019 bat, but these here socks are better. I\nmust wrap them up in paper. Where\u2019s that piece the meat came in? (Rises\nand searches, at last finding it.) I don\u2019t believe in this new-fangled\nnonsense about red ribbon and holly tags for wrapping presents. (Wraps\nsocks in meat paper.)\n\n(Enter Abner, whistling, sets down lantern, takes off boots and puts on\nbright colored carpet slippers. Goes to mirror and combs hair.)\n\nABNER.\u2014The chores are all done now, thank goodness. Where\u2019s that book I\nwuz readin\u2019, \u201cWyoming Will, the Hero of Gold Gulch?\u201d (Searches on table\nand finds it. Sits down to read.)\n\nSUSAN.\u2014Did you shut the henhouse door and lock the stable?\n\nABNER.\u2014Yes, ma\u2019am. I got up at three o\u2019clock this morning, an\u2019 I swept\nthe barn an\u2019 fed the horses an\u2019 cows an\u2019 pigs an\u2019 chickens, an\u2019 did\nthe milkin\u2019, an\u2019 shoveled paths, an\u2019 split kindlin\u2019 an sawed wood, an\u2019\ncleaned the harness, an\u2019 got the mail, an\u2019 shoveled some more, an\u2019\nmended the sleigh, an\u2019 did the evening chores, an\u2019 now it\u2019s nine an\u2019\nI\u2019m through. (Sighs.) Nothin\u2019 to do till to-morrow. Ain\u2019t I the lucky\nguy?\n\nSUSAN.\u2014Yes, Abner, you are a right lucky boy to be hired man here I can\ntell you, an\u2019 I hope you won\u2019t be foolish an\u2019 run away to the city. You\nmay be plumb thankful you have to work. Do you know who finds mischief\nfor idle hands?\n\nABNER (promptly).\u2014Yes, ma\u2019am, you do. I know what I\u2019d do if I had a lot\nof money, though.\n\nSUSAN.\u2014What would you do?\n\nABNER.\u2014I\u2019d go to a high-class hotel an\u2019 hire a number-one room, an\u2019\nleave orders to be called at three.\n\nSUSAN.\u2014That\u2019s a crazy notion.\n\nABNER.\u2014Then, when they knocked on my door, I\u2019d say, Nix, I don\u2019t have\nto get up.\n\nSUSAN.\u2014Hark! I hear someone at the gate. I hope it ain\u2019t a tramp. I\nain\u2019t got no time for those fellers that don\u2019t want to work between\nmeals. Cut out the meals, I say, if that\u2019s the case.\n\nABNER.\u2014You\u2019ve got as much sympathy for them as you have for me. The\nonly place _I_ find sympathy is in the dictionary.\n\nSUSAN.\u2014Don\u2019t stop to talk, Abner, but open the door.\n\n(Abner reluctantly lays down his book and rises.)\n\nABNER.\u2014Got to tend door, too. Next thing I\u2019ll have to wear a frilly\napron and a dinky little cap. Miss Susan is sure the President of the\nSociety for the Prevention of Leisure.\n\nVOICE.\u2014Anybody home?\n\nABNER.\u2014Nobody but the lamp and that\u2019s going out.\n\n(Opens door and enter storm-bound party.)\n\nABNER.\u2014Well, I swan! Are you sure you\u2019re all here and ain\u2019t left\nanybody setting down in the snow? (A thought strikes him.) If this is a\nsurprise for Miss Susan, you\u2019re a week too late for her seventy-eighth\nbirthday was last Wednesday.\n\nSUSAN.\u2014Abner! Aren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself! Seventy-eighth birthday!\n\nEDITH.\u2014We really must apologize for coming in this\u2014er\u2014this\u2014what IS the\nword I want?\n\nTOM.\u2014Nervy.\n\nEDITH.\u2014No, indeed. I mean unceremonious. That\u2019s it. This unceremonious\nfashion. We are passengers on the Limited, and it is stalled in the\nsnow half a mile below here.\n\nTOM.\u2014We\u2019ve been late the last six hours, for the train before was\nbehind, and we were behind before besides.\n\nEDITH.\u2014We hated to spend Christmas eve in a snow bank, half frozen,\nand the conductor said it would be at least two hours before the plows\ncould reach us.\n\nTOM.\u2014So, when we saw the lights of your farm-house, we invited\nourselves, and we hope you will accept the invitation.\n\nSUSAN.\u2014Well, this is a surprise party, an\u2019 I am plumb pleased to see\nyou folks, for I wuz lonesome here by myself. I wouldn\u2019t want nobody\na-celebratin\u2019 Christmas eve in a snow bank. I thought I heard that\ntrain a-whistlin\u2019 there awhile ago, an\u2019 yet I didn\u2019t hear it go past;\nthey\u2019re company for me, them trains, though I fought considerable agin\nthe track crossing my land. Their fust plan was to have the tracks run\nright through my barn, and I set my foot on that. No, sir, says I. I\nain\u2019t goin\u2019 to get up all hours of the night at my age, to open the\nbarn doors to let them trains through, an\u2019 shut \u2019em after they pass. I\nguess that made them railroad men change their plans. Abner, take the\nfolks\u2019 coats an\u2019 hats. Sit down all of you an\u2019 get thawed out.\n\nMISS PRUDENCE.\u2014Be careful of that hat, young man. I\u2019ve worn it six\nyears. (Removes hat and hands it to him.)\n\nEDITH.\u2014Why, I get a new one every season. Last Easter I had such a\npretty one, all trimmed with pansies, and the milliner sent it home in\na paper bag. Uncle Reuben opened the door and took it in, for I had\ngone to bed. He thought it was flowers, so he put it to soak in the\ndishpan all night, and you should have seen it in the morning.\n\n(Abner lays down pile of wraps and proceeds to try on Tom\u2019s hat\nand overcoat. \u201cBusiness\u201d of examining wraps, trying on hats, while\nwhistling\u2014\n\nor something monotonous which should be introduced at every\nopportunity. Whistle \u201coff the key\u201d as much as possible. The others\nwhisper to each other, moving quietly, to positions away from centre,\nto right and left.)\n\nABNER.\u2014Now I can get the latest city styles better than Bill Barker\u2019s\nmail-order catalogue that he was reading out of last night. These\nclothes have sure got some class to them. If Lorena Boggs had seen me\nnow she wouldn\u2019t have gone to the picnic with the soap salesmen, she\u2019d\nhave gone with yours truly. (Puts on hat.) This is I reckon one of\nthem there fried egg derbies that\u2019s so nifty. Yes, sir, if I\u2019d been\ntogged up in these here instead of them hand-me-downs of Miss Susan\u2019s\nbrother\u2019s. (Miss Susan approaches him.) I\u2019d have gone up to Lorena, and\ntaken off my hat like this an\u2019 said\u2014\n\nMISS SUSAN (sharply).\u2014Don\u2019t be a fool!\n\nABNER (as if surprised).\u2014No, ma\u2019am, I wouldn\u2019t said that to Lorena at\nall!\n\nMISS SUSAN (in irritation).\u2014Haven\u2019t you any sense?\n\nABNER.\u2014No, ma\u2019am, nor dollars either, seeing as I earn ten dollars a\nmonth and there ain\u2019t no raise of salary visible to the naked eye.\n\n(Exit with wraps, whistling).\n\nMISS PRISCILLA (advancing).\u2014I am certainly glad to be here, for I\u2019m\nalways so nervous when traveling. I\u2019m afraid of losing my ticket. That\nreminds me\u2014I wonder if I have it now! (Opens valise and nervously takes\nout miscellaneous articles. Shakes her head. Replaces articles. Opens\nhand bag, and finds ticket.) Thank goodness, here it is!\n\nTOM.\u2014I lost my ticket once and when I told the conductor I was\ntraveling on my face he said he always punched his fares, and guessed I\nwasn\u2019t going very far.\n\nEDITH.\u2014I get nervous, too, and when I was in England with Cousin Lydia,\nI had two bags and a rug, and I asked the porter if he had seen two\nrags and a bug.\n\nMISS PRUDENCE (looking about her).\u2014How delightfully comfortable it is\nhere, and how charming your old-fashioned furniture is. We don\u2019t see\nanything like it nowadays.\n\nTOM.\u2014No, modern furniture is on the instalment plan; pay a dollar down\nand a dollar a week till death us do part.\n\nMISS PRISCILLA.\u2014If you will permit us, Miss Susan, we will continue\nour fancy work, for we are somewhat belated with our Christmas gifts.\n(Abner enters.)\n\nMISS SUSAN.\u2014No need to offer excuses, ladies, for I like to see folks\nbusy.\n\nABNER (with earnestness).\u2014Yes, ma\u2019am, you do.\n\nMISS PRUDENCE.\u2014I was reading in a magazine article recently that a\nbusiness man should always be well-dressed, and as my nephew has\nrecently accepted a position with a large firm, I am making him a\nhandsome necktie for business wear. (Displays gaudy tie to audience,\nand then continues knitting it.)\n\nMISS PRISCILLA.\u2014I am making a gift for my sister-in-law who is a woman\nof fashion, and who is fond of automobiling, so I am knitting her a\ntasteful scarf which I am sure will prove pleasing. (Shows gay muffler,\nand continues knitting it.)\n\nSUSAN.\u2014What do you folks say to having a Christmas tree?\n\nALL.\u2014Fine!\n\nSUSAN.\u2014Well, I ain\u2019t had a tree for years, but I think it would be nice\nto trim up one to celebrate.\n\nEDITH.\u2014That will be splendid!\n\nSUSAN.\u2014Then Mr. Tom you an\u2019 Abner go out and chop down a tree. Land\nsakes! Abner\u2019s asleep an\u2019 I never called him till quarter past three!\nAbner! Wake up! Take off them slippers, an\u2019 put on your gum boots, an\u2019\ngo chop down a tree!\n\nABNER (drowsily).\u2014I ain\u2019t George Washington! Work again!\n\n     (Repeats). O life is just a round of joy\n                To one who is a hired boy.\n\n(Whistling, exeunt Abner and Tom.)\n\nSUSAN.\u2014Now we\u2019ll get the decorations ready. (Takes up bowl of popcorn.)\nI know you young ladies will enjoy stringing these. (Bring pail of\ncranberries, needles and thread.)\n\nMISS PRISCILLA (reluctantly).\u2014I can hardly spare the time from my fancy\nwork, as I know that my sister-in-law would be terribly disappointed if\nthis scarf were not completed.\n\nMISS PRUDENCE.\u2014It is really imperative that I finish this scarf for\ndear Reginald, so we will continue our knitting while the others make\nready the decorations.\n\n(Enter Miss Wise, Miss Markus and Rastus the porter, the latter\ncarrying suit-cases.)\n\nMISS WISE.\u2014This really is an imposition, but when we saw the others\ncrossing the fields to your delightful farm-house, we thought we would\nfollow their example.\n\n(Porter sets down suit-cases and extends his hand.)\n\nMISS WISE.\u2014Dear me, must I pay another porter?\n\n(Miss Wise and Miss Markus give porter coins which he pockets with\nthanks.)\n\nRASTUS.\u2014Dis sholy am a salubrious farm. Nice place for chickens. I\nwonder if dey\u2019s all roostin\u2019 now?\n\nSUSAN (nervously).\u2014I hope Abner locked that henhouse door!\n\nMISS MARKUS.\u2014I\u2019m surely glad to be here, for that train was dreadfully\ncold.\n\nRASTUS.\u2014Well I been habin\u2019 trubbel too, for de genelman in de diner dis\nmornin\u2019 he ordered two fried eggs,\u2014two fried eggs he sez, one fried\non one side an\u2019 one fried on tother. I asked him again jest natchelly\nthinkin\u2019 I hadn\u2019t heard c\u2019rect, an\u2019 he say \u201cTwo fried eggs, one fried\non one side an\u2019 one fried on tother,\u201d I done told de cook an\u2019 he wuz\ndat mad he gwine pitch me out de winder into a snow bank? Yes, sir, an\u2019\nsee de black eye he gib me! Mebbe it doan\u2019 show but its dere all right!\n\nSUSAN (cordially).\u2014I hope you ladies will feel quite at home, and join\nus in our preparations for a Christmas tree.\n\nMISS WISE.\u2014That will be lovely. Porter, take my wraps and be careful of\nmy Raglan coat.\n\nRASTUS.\u2014Yessum, I\u2019ll shore take care of dat ragbag coat.\n\nMISS WISE.\u2014Raglan, not ragbag!\n\nMISS MARKUS.\u2014What a relief to have finished my school work! I had a\nterrific headache from correcting those papers of mine. What do you\nthink of answers like this? One of my scholars in English history said\nthat the kings were not allowed to order taxis without the consent of\nParliament.\n\nTOM.\u2014Well, it kept the rulers from being too extravagant.\n\nMISS WISE.\u2014I told one of my young hopefuls to write a sentence\ncontaining the word income and this was the sentence, \u201cI opened the\ndoor and in come the cat.\u201d\n\nMISS MARKUS.\u2014I asked a boy what gravitation was and he said,\n\u201cGravitation is that which if there were none we should all fly away.\u201d\n\nMISS WISE.\u2014I was positively discouraged with my algebra class. One girl\nwrote that algebraic symbols were used when you didn\u2019t know what you\nwere talking about.\n\n(Abner\u2019s whistle is heard.)\n\nMISS MARKUS.\u2014O that whistling! Is that all he can whistle?\n\nSUSAN.\u2014Yes, and it gets on my nerves somethin\u2019 awful sometimes.\n\nMISS MARKUS.\u2014Have you a lemon? Lemon juice is most good for everything.\n\n(Susan procures a lemon and hands it to her as Abner and Tom enter with\ntree.)\n\nTOM.\u2014Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is some tree. I cannot tell a lie,\nI did it with my little hatchet.\n\nABNER.\u2014You mean I did it. That\u2019s the way it always is, I do the work\nand some other feller gets the credit of it.\n\nSUSAN.\u2014Well, Abner, I think you had better see that the henhouse door\nis locked. I\u2019d feel safer. My brother in the South heard someone in\nhis henhouse one night, and he went out with a gun to investigate. He\nhollered out, \u201cHey, who\u2019s there?\u201d And the third time he spoke right up\nan\u2019 said he\u2019d shoot; then a voice came right plumb out of that henhouse\nan\u2019 said, \u201cDon\u2019t shoot, massa, it\u2019s only one of us chickens.\u201d\n\nRASTUS.\u2014Yas\u2019m! I done heerd \u2019bout dat. He\u2019s de genelman what was skeert\nto leave de henhouse do\u2019 open, kase de chickens might all go home.\n(Rolls his eyes and laughs).\n\nTOM (to Rastus).\u2014Come on, Rastus, help me up with this tree, but\nremember this is a free-gratis job, no tips for this.\n\nRASTUS.\u2014Why sholy, Sir, I wouldn\u2019t want no remuneration for settin\u2019 up\na Christmas tree.\n\nTOM.\u2014We\u2019ll nail it to a board. (Takes hammer and strikes his finger.\nYells.)\n\n(All speaking at once.)\n\nEDITH.\u2014Did you hurt yourself?\n\nABNER.\u2014What you do it for?\n\nSUSAN.\u2014Ain\u2019t you hurt yourself?\n\nRASTUS.\u2014How did that\u2014ar happen?\n\nTOM.\u2014I did it for fun of course. O those foolish questions! (Puts thumb\nin mouth. Abner begins his whistle. Miss Markus bites top off lemon\nand begins sucking it (or pretends to). Abner sees, and after a few\nefforts to whistle, gives up. Miss Markus places lemon somewhere. Abner\nwatching slyly, and when opportunity arrives slips it in his pocket.)\n\nSUSAN.\u2014Now all get busy and trim the tree for we have plenty of popcorn\nand cranberries. Abner, hand me some of those nice red apples to tie on\nthe branches.\n\nABNER (sighing).\u2014More work! (During the following all trim tree.)\n\nSUSAN (severely).\u2014Abner, I have always tried to inculcate in you habits\nof industry. Do you not remember the poem about the little busy bee?\n\nABNER.\u2014Well, if any one takes me for a bee they\u2019ll get stung!\n\n(Miss Wise and others decorate the tree with the strings of cranberries\nand popcorn.)\n\nEDITH.\u2014Abner, hand me an apple, there\u2019s a good boy, this branch just\nneeds one.\n\nMISS WISE.\u2014Abner, give me a string of cranberries, a nice long one.\n\nABNER.\u2014My land! what a rest-cure this here farm is!\n\nSUSAN.\u2014Abner, get some string from the kitchen.\n\nEDITH.\u2014Look out, Tom, your tipping the tree.\n\nRASTUS.\u2014If dere\u2019s any tippin\u2019 roun\u2019 here, doan\u2019t forget de porter.\n\nEDITH.\u2014Abner you\u2019re real tall, hang that string of popcorn there on the\ntop branch. (Abner gets chair.)\n\nSUSAN.\u2014Abner don\u2019t you dare stand on that chair, you\u2019ll break it!\n\nMISS WISE.\u2014Now our tree looks fine! I am proud of it!\n\nSUSAN (suddenly).\u2014Why how inhospitable I am! I\u2019ve never offered you a\nthing to eat and you must be half starved!\n\nABNER (promptly).\u2014Yes\u2019m, a pie and some gingerbread would sure go good!\n\nSUSAN.\u2014I didn\u2019t mean you, Abner, I meant the company.\n\nEDITH.\u2014I must say it sounds good to me!\n\nTOM (enthusiastically).\u2014Lead me to it!\n\nRASTUS (announcing).\u2014First call for dinner in de dining car!\n\n                    Second call for dinner in de dining car!\n\n                      Last call for dinner in de dining car!\n\nSUSAN.\u2014Abner, you can stay and redd up the sitting room while we have\nsupper!\n\n(Exeunt all, while Abner pantomimes disgust, but takes the lemon from\nhis pocket, looks at it, grins, replaces it, and, whistling, takes\nseat; begins to doze and nod as curtain falls.)\n\n\n(_Intermission._)\n\n\n\n\nACT II.\n\n\n(Curtain rises on same scene. Abner dozing, chin on chest, or head\nback, mouth open. Voice outside, \u201cThat sure was good pie, Aunt Susan.\u201d\nAbner wakens, rises.)\n\nABNER (soliloquizing).\u2014That\u2019s just it! The others all in there eatin\u2019\npie, an\u2019 me got to redd up the settin\u2019 room like a sissy! (Picks up a\nfew articles in a discontented manner.) Christmas tree! Much chance\nthere is of being something for me on that tree! I guess stinginess\nmust run in Miss Susan\u2019s family, for when her brother and his wife\nspent Christmas here last year, do you s\u2019pose they brought Miss Susan\na present? Nix! Christmas morning brother says (mimicking) \u201cMerry\nChristmas, dear Susan! We wish to give you a useful gift and no foolish\ntrumpery, so Amelia and I decided to pay for having your henhouse\nwhitewashed as it needs it badly.\u201d Then that there generous giver he\nturns to me and says, \u201cAbner, my boy (mimicking), I do not wish to\nforget you, and I have noticed that a pane in your bedroom window is\nbroken, so I will have it fixed at my expense.\u201d Yessum, that there\ngentleman literally and figuratively gives me a pane!\n\n(Continues work, whistling over and over\u2014)\n\nWell I s\u2019pose now I have performed the noble duties of a vacuum cleaner\nenough to satisfy Miss Susan, an\u2019 here comes them pie-eaters!\n\n(Enter all except Aunt Susan.)\n\nEDITH.\u2014I really think we ought to give some presents to this dear old\nlady who has been so good to us. Let\u2019s hang up a stocking for her.\nAbner, you get one, there\u2019s a good boy.\n\n(Exit Abner, returns immediately with stocking, and meanwhile guests\nrummage through valises for suitable gifts.)\n\nABNER.\u2014I\u2019ll contribute the pair of red socks she gave me.\n\nEDITH.\u2014How ungrateful! I\u2019m going to put in this pretty lace\nhandkerchief.\n\nPRISCILLA.\u2014Here\u2019s the jelly I was going to give Uncle Joshua. He\u2019ll\nnever know the difference.\n\nTOM.\u2014Right-O. What you don\u2019t know don\u2019t hurt you. That\u2019s a good motto.\n\nRASTUS.\u2014Dis here am a rabbit foot, an\u2019 it will sholy bring de Madam\ngood luck. An\u2019 whenever she travels on de Limited I\u2019ll sholy see dat\nshe is taken care of. I\u2019ll steal a magazine from de train boy, and\npinch a box of chocolates when he ain\u2019t lookin\u2019 an\u2019 I\u2019ll tell de waiter\nin de diner to make out her check wrong so she gets twice as much as\nshe pays for.\n\nMISS PRISCILLA.\u2014What a shocking sense of honor.\n\nRASTUS.\u2014Yes, Miss, I\u2019m a genelman of honor, an\u2019 when a lady is as kind\nas de Madam here, I suttinly would study to pay her back. I\u2019d even put\nsome of de neighbors\u2019 hens in her henhouse. Here am a couple of silver\nspoons for de lady. (Brings spoons from pocket.)\n\nEDITH.\u2014(Examining spoon). C. P. R. That\u2019s Canadian Pacific Railroad.\n\nRASTUS (with dignity).\u2014No, Miss. Dat means Colored Pusson\u2019s Remembrance.\n\n(Enter Susan.)\n\nALL.\u2014Merry Christmas.\n\nEDITH.\u2014This is a little token of appreciation of your kindness, which\nwe hope you will accept. (Hands stocking to Aunt Susan.)\n\nABNER.\u2014Nobody says nothin\u2019 about my kindness for workin\u2019 overtime\ntrampin\u2019 out in the snow for the tree. I\u2019ll join the hired man\u2019s union\nand strike for only sixteen hours a day.\n\nSUSAN.\u2014Well, I never. I ain\u2019t hung up a Christmas stocking for forty\nyears.\n\nEDITH.\u2014What do you suppose became of that man in the car with us who\nsaid he was an inventor and spent all his time drawing on brown paper\nwith a stubby pencil?\n\nTOM.\u2014I think he was inventing a convertible submarine, one that could\nbe turned into an air ship when necessary.\n\nMISS PRUDENCE.\u2014Maybe he has frozen to death upon the train.\n\n(Knock at door and enter Inventor.)\n\nINVENTOR.\u2014Good evening, ladies and gentlemen! Madam, will you permit me\nto avail myself of the shelter of your home? When the other passengers\nleft the train I was so absorbed in a drawing I was making that I did\nnot observe their departure until a few minutes ago. So seeing the\nlights of your farm-house I started across the snow.\n\nSUSAN.\u2014You are very welcome. Abner, take the gentleman\u2019s hat and coat.\n\n(Inventor hands hat and overcoat to Abner and absentmindedly gives him\na tip.)\n\nABNER.\u2014Thank you, sir.\n\nRASTUS.\u2014Hey you, don\u2019t be buttin\u2019 into Pullam porter\u2019s work.\n\nEDITH.\u2014Merry Christmas to you.\n\nINVENTOR.\u2014O dear me. It is Christmas isn\u2019t it. I had forgotten all\nabout it.\n\nRASTUS.\u2014Yes, sir, this am the happy Christmas time when everybody gives\npresents, specially to them what has blackened their shoes and brushed\ntheir overcoats and waited on them in the diner. Folks gives them\npussons presents like fifty cent pieces an\u2019 dollar bills to show their\nappreciation an\u2019 gratitude.\n\nABNER.\u2014Well, Rastus, you come round here this spring and I\u2019ll give you\nan asparagus tip.\n\nINVENTOR.\u2014Ladies, gentlemen and Rastus!\n\nRASTUS.\u2014What\u2019s dat? Ladies, gen\u2019l\u2019men and Rastus!\n\nINVENTOR.\u2014Surely. You\u2019re not a lady, are you? Your youth and\ninexperience precludes the possibility of your exercising a gentleman\u2019s\nprerogatives, and therefore having eliminated all surrounding\nsuperfluities you remain\u2014just Rastus; that\u2019s all.\n\nRASTUS.\u2014Jes\u2019 so! When de wissle blows, fo\u2019 ev\u2019rybody else it means\ndinner time, but fo\u2019 me its jes\u2019 twelve o\u2019clock an\u2019 dat\u2019s all.\n\nINVENTOR.\u2014Correct. To resume. Ladies, gentlemen and Rastus. You all\nhave contributed to the success of the Christmas party. (To Tom.)\nDoubtless this young giant hewed this mighty monarch of the forest\n(points to tree) and single-handed and alone bore it upon his capacious\nback to this hospitable domicile for our delectation.\n\nABNER.\u2014Well, I never! After all the work I done dragging that there\ntree through them there drifts!\n\nINVENTOR (continuing).\u2014And the ladies by decorating the tree in this\nmost artistic manner (girls courtesy), and this estimable friend by\noffering us her hospitality, so I would like to contribute to the\nevening\u2019s pleasure.\n\nRASTUS.\u2014Yessir! You shall sholy contribute. Where\u2019s a genelman\u2019s hat\nfor de c\u2019lection box!\n\nINVENTOR.\u2014So I will have a new invention of mine which is in the\nbaggage car brought here, with this lady\u2019s kind permission.\n\nSUSAN.\u2014Certainly, I am greatly interested in new inventions. Abner, go\nover to the train and get the gentleman\u2019s box. The porter will help\nyou. Abner, are you asleep again?\n\nABNER.\u2014Nothing to do till to-morrow. Plow through them drifts again? I\nain\u2019t no snowplow, Miss Susan. Have a heart can\u2019t you?\n\nSUSAN.\u2014You should be glad to do anything to give others happiness.\n\nABNER.\u2014Come on, Rastus. All aboard for the North Pole. (Go out\nwhistling.)\n\nSUSAN.\u2014It is such a great pleasure to have you young folks all here,\nfor Abner and I would have spent a very quiet Christmas together,\nand this really seems like a very festive celebration. My father was\nalways a great hand for keeping Christmas, and he contrived to combine\ngenerosity with economy in a very remarkable manner. I remember one\nyear he purchased a china cup for my mother, and desiring to prolong\nher pleasure in the gift he gave her the cup alone for Christmas and\nthe saucer for her birthday in April.\n\nEDITH.\u2014My Aunt Malvina is a great hand for giving useful presents,\nand one Christmas she gave the boys a rubber doormat, and Lilian, her\nlittle girl, a set of soup spoons.\n\nMISS PRISCILLA.\u2014I\u2019m thankful that this tie is almost completed, and I\u2019m\nsure that it will please my nephew who is most elegant and refined in\nhis tastes. (Exhibits tie.)\n\n(Voices without are heard.)\n\n\u201cEasy there!\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, you, Abner. Doan you drop dat ar on my toes!\u201d\n\n\u201cGivin\u2019 me all the weight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t! Hol\u2019 on dar!\u201d\n\n\u201cLook out, you\u2019ll smash the door!\u201d\n\n\u201cEasy! Whoa dar, Abner!\u201d\n\n(Enter Rastus and Abner. Draw aside curtain and reveal Wishing Box.)\n\nRASTUS.\u2014Here she am, sah! Nigh as heavy as a Mogul locomotive.\n\nABNER.\u2014Jiminy! My feet are cold! Where\u2019s them slippers?\n\nINVENTOR.\u2014Here it is, ladies and gentlemen, the wonder of the ages!\n\nEDITH.\u2014How interesting.\n\nINVENTOR.\u2014I will explain it if you desire.\n\nMISS PRISCILLA.\u2014I am sure it will be most edifying.\n\nRASTUS.\u2014If there am gwine to be speechifyin\u2019 I reckon you an\u2019 me had\nbetter fortify ourselves with popcorn, Abner. (Abner, and Rastus take\nstrings of popcorn from the tree unobserved and eat them.)\n\nINVENTOR (as if lecturing).\u2014Ladies and gentlemen, it affords me great\npleasure to address this cultured and intelligent audience.\n\nRASTUS (aside).\u2014That\u2019s us, Abner, cultured an\u2019 intelligent!\n\nINVENTOR.\u2014My invention is the result of years of study, experimentation\nand research and is destined to fill a long felt want.\n\nTOM (aside).\u2014That\u2019s what they say about every new rat-trap, egg-beater,\ndictionary, or patent hairpin.\n\nINVENTOR.\u2014One of the secrets of the psychological unrest which\ncharacterizes the human race is that each person desires, in short, to\nbe someone else. The poor man wishes he were rich, the rich man would\nlike to be a boy again, the young would like to be old, and the old\nyoung. Now by means of my remarkable invention, these wishes may be\ngratified either permanently or temporarily.\n\nEDITH.\u2014You really mean that any one can be transformed into somebody\nelse by stepping into the wishing box?\n\nINVENTOR.\u2014Precisely, my dear young lady, and I desire to offer as a\nChristmas gift to this pleasant little assembly the transformation\nwhich each one desires.\n\nABNER.\u2014Well, I wish (clapping his hand to his mouth) I nearly put my\nfoot into it that time!\n\nTOM.\u2014Your mouth?\n\nEDITH.\u2014Aunt Susan, you make the first wish.\n\nRASTUS.\u2014Wish for a watermelon, or a possum, or fried chicken.\n\nSUSAN.\u2014I know a lot of things I wanted when I was a young girl, but I\nain\u2019t young no more. (Regretfully.) I wish I didn\u2019t have gray hair.\n\nINVENTOR.\u2014You made your wish, Aunt Susan. Hop into the box.\n\nSUSAN (as she gets in).\u2014Mercy sakes, it\u2019s all the hair I have, I don\u2019t\nwant to be bald.\n\n(Inventor grinds policeman\u2019s rattle a few moments, and assists Aunt\nSusan out, who now, having removed wig, has hair in long braid.)\n\nEDITH.\u2014What lovely hair. Do let me arrange it for you, Aunt Susan.\n(Arranges hair, while next character enters box.)\n\nINVENTOR (to spinsters).\u2014Now, ladies?\n\nPRISCILLA.\u2014Well, it may be a foolish wish, but (looks toward sister who\nnods) we would like to be young again.\n\nINVENTOR.\u2014Very easily done. Step right into the magic box.\n\n(The two spinsters assisted by the porter enter the box and emerge\nagain, having removed cloaks and let down hair, and are seen in girlish\ndresses. They look in the mirror and smile at each other.)\n\nINVENTOR.\u2014Now for our teachers?\n\nMISS WISE.\u2014I have consulted my friends, and we agree that we would\nrather have a year\u2019s vacation than anything else.\n\nINVENTOR.\u2014A sensible wish. (Draws three envelopes from box.) Here,\nladies, you will find leave of absence with salary for a year, and\ntrust that you will spend a delightful vacation.\n\nABNER.\u2014Well, I wish I could be a soap salesman so the girls would take\nsome notice of me, like that feller that comes round here every once in\nawhile an\u2019 sells perfumery and stuff.\n\nINVENTOR.\u2014Very well, young man, step into the box and your wish shall\nbe granted.\n\nABNER.\u2014Goodbye chores! And bossy cows and pigs and chickens, I\u2019m going\non the road.\n\nSUSAN.\u2014Mercy! I don\u2019t know how I can get along without Abner. He was\nvery troublesome sometimes but he was a helpful boy, and a splendid\nhand with the pigs and chickens. (Business of rattle, etc. Abner comes\nout of the box).\n\nABNER.\u2014Ladies and gentlemen, permit me to bring to your observation our\nfamous Scrubit Soap the wonder of the century, the marvel of the ages\nand the apex, acme, and ne plus ultra of our civilization. Soap, ladies\nand gentlemen, soap. I appeal to your\u2014\u2014\n\nEDITH.\u2014O for pity sakes, we can\u2019t hear ourselves think.\n\nMISS MARKUS.\u2014How delightful it is to think that we won\u2019t have to teach\nfor a whole year.\n\nABNER.\u2014Ladies, I perceive that you now have your pay envelope. May I\nsuggest that you devote a little of your money to the purchase of soap?\nI have many varieties here. Nifty Soap for Nice People, Pink Powder for\nParticular Persons, and Diamond Dust which makes washday an occasion of\nrejoicing equal to Fourth of July, Valentine or Christmas?\n\nSUSAN.\u2014Abner, what has come over you?\n\nINVENTOR.\u2014It is simply my wonderful invention, madam, and instead of\nbeing tied down to the pursuit of agriculture which was evidently\ndistasteful to him, he has now entered the mercantile world.\n\nABNER.\u2014Miss Susan, here is Cleanup Soap for tired toilers, especially\ngood for farmhands.\n\nTOM.\u2014Have you a little hired boy in your home?\n\nMISS SUSAN.\u2014O don\u2019t pester me!\n\nABNER.\u2014Is any one here interested in a hand laundry?\n\nMISS SUSAN.\u2014Hand laundry? I should say not! Just think of folks bein\u2019\ntoo plum lazy to wash their own hands.\n\nABNER (to porter).\u2014Rastus, here is a bleacher which I think would help\nyou.\n\nRASTUS.\u2014Massy sakes! Bleach me? I\u2019d like to be white all right!\n\nINVENTOR.\u2014Well, Rastus, you\u2019ve made your wish. Into the box with you!\n\nRASTUS.\u2014O no! Massa I was only being facetious like!\n\nTOM.\u2014A wish is a wish, into the box with you!\n\n(Rushes Rastus into the box, etc. Business of rattle. The substitute\nRastus emerges.)\n\nRASTUS.\u2014That sholy am a wonderful box.\n\nABNER.\u2014Can I sell you some skin food?\n\nRASTUS.\u2014Why, I feed my mouf, I don\u2019t feed mah skin!\n\nTOM (to Edith).\u2014Why, Sis, you haven\u2019t had your wish. Fire away.\n\nEDITH.\u2014It sounds silly, but I want to be a young lady, so that I can go\nto parties.\n\nINVENTOR.\u2014Foolish child, stay young while you can. Get into the box\nthough.\n\n(Edith enters, and emerges in party dress, with fan and flowers.)\n\nTOM.\u2014Well, I wish I were a college fellow for they have no end of a\ngood time!\n\nINVENTOR.\u2014Into the box with you, young man, and we\u2019ll transform you\ninto a Rah! Rah! boy in no time.\n\n(Tom emerges from box with college cap, college sweater, carrying\ncollege flag.)\n\nTOM.\u2014This is fine fellows! Give three cheers for the wishing box!\n\n(Leads cheers.)\n\n  Fra-valio! E\u2014E\u2014E\u2014E!\n  Fra-valio (whistle)\n  E\u2014nick\u2014a\u2014deena\u2014ena\u2014wah!\n  E\u2014nick\u2014a\u2014deena\u2014hah! hah! hah!\n  Wishing Box! Wishing box! Ah!\n\nABNER.\u2014A college education is an excellent thing but I prefer life\nin the great mercantile world, and what could be more stimulating to\nhealth, happiness and psychological contentment than the dissemination\nof useful articles conducive to cheerfulness and cleanliness which when\nonce tried, always used. Let me call you attention to these novelties\nespecially appropriate and appreciated as Christmas gifts for mothers,\nsisters, aunts, cousins, wives, daughters, sweethearts, and others.\nLilac Lotion for Lovely Ladies, twenty-five cents per bottle, this\ntrifling sum including not only the lotion itself but bottle, cork,\nwrapping paper, high grade string and advertising matter which is both\ninteresting and instructive.\n\n(Exhibits bottle.)\n\nEDITH.\u2014O who wants your Lilac Lotion for Lovely Ladies?\n\nABNER.\u2014Correct, miss, absolutely, unreservedly and undoubtedly\ncorrect, for there are many ladies who are not lovely. For them I have\n(producing a bottle) Helps for the Homely, First Aid to the Fat, and\nthe Fiji Freckle-Killer.\n\nINVENTOR (pointing to Abner).\u2014You see, ladies and gentlemen, the\ncomplete change which my wishing box has wrought. He\u2019s even lost his\nwhistle.\n\nSUSAN.\u2014Somehow I don\u2019t think Abner is specially improved.\n\nRASTUS.\u2014Hark! I done hear a snowplow moseyin\u2019 along. I guess this here\nChristmas party will have to be adjournin\u2019.\n\n(Whistle is heard.)\n\nTOM.\u2014Ladies and gentlemen, fellow-citizens and fellow-travelers, I move\nthat before we adjourn to the Limited we give three cheers for Faraway\nFarm and Miss Susan. (Repeat yell, ending Miss Susan.)\n\nTOM.\u2014Now, three cheers for the Inventor and his Wishing Box.\n\n(Repeat yell ending \u201cInventor! Merry Christmas!\u201d)\n\n(If desired local cheers may be given as the curtain falls.)\n\n\n\nObvious punctuation errors repaired.\n\nPage 13, \u201cperogatives\u201d changed to \u201cprerogatives\u201d (a gentleman\u2019s\nprerogatives)\n\nPage 17, the following line had less of an initial indentation than\nother lines in the play. As no reason for this could be ascertained, it\nwas concluded to be a typesetting error and ignored.\n\n    SUSAN.\u2014Abner, what has come over you?",
