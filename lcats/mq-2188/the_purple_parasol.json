    "body": "\n\nYoung Rossiter did not like the task. The more he thought of it as he\nwhirled northward on the Empire State Express the more distasteful it\nseemed to grow.\n\n\"Hang it all,\" he thought, throwing down his magazine in disgust, \"it's\nlike police work. And heaven knows I haven't wanted to be a cop since we\nlived in Newark twenty years ago. Why the dickens did old Wharton marry\nher? He's an old ass, and he's getting just what he might have expected.\nShe's twenty-five and beautiful; he's seventy and a sight. I've a notion\nto chuck the whole affair and go back to the simple but virtuous\nTenderloin. It's not my sort, that's all, and I was an idiot for mixing in\nit. The firm served me a shabby trick when it sent me out to work up this\ncase for Wharton. It's a regular Peeping Tom Job, and I don't like it.\"\n\nIt will require but few words to explain Sam Rossiter's presence in the\nnorth-bound Empire Express, but it would take volumes to express his\nfeelings on the subject in general. Back in New York there lived Godfrey\nWharton, millionaire and septuagenarian. For two years he had been husband\nto one of the prettiest, gayest young women in the city, and in the latter\ndays of this responsibility he was not a happy man. His wife had fallen\ndesperately, even conspicuously, in love with Everett Havens, the new\nleading man at one of the fashionable playhouses. The affair had been\ngoing on for weeks, and it had at last become the talk of the town. By\n\"the town\" is meant that vague, expansive thing known as the \"Four\nHundred.\" Sam Rossiter, two years out of Yale, was an attachment to, but\nnot a component part of, the Four Hundred. The Whartons were of the inner\ncircle.\n\nYoung Rossiter was ambitious. He was, besides, keen, aggressive, and\ndetermined to make well for himself. Entering the great law offices of\nGrover & Dickhut immediately after leaving college, he devoted himself\nassiduously to the career in prospect. He began by making its foundation\nas substantial as brains and energy would permit. So earnest, so\nsuccessful was he that Grover & Dickhut regarded him as the most promising\nyoung man in New York. They predicted a great future for him, no small\npart of which was the ultimate alteration of an office shingle, the name\nof Rossiter going up in gilt, after that of Dickhut. And, above all,\nRossiter was a handsome, likable chap. Tall, fair, sunny-hearted, well\ngroomed, he was a fellow that both sexes liked without much effort.\n\nThe Wharton trouble was bound to prove startling any way one looked at\nit. The prominence of the family, the baldness of its skeleton, and the\ngleeful eagerness with which it danced into full view left but little for\nmeddlers to covet. A crash was inevitable; it was the _clash_ that\nGrover & Dickhut were trying to avert. Old Wharton, worn to a slimmer\nfrazzle than he had ever been before his luckless marriage, was determined\nto divorce his insolent younger half. It was to be done with as little\nnoise as possible, more for his own sake than for hers. Wharton was proud\nin, not of, his weakness.\n\nIt became necessary to \"shadow\" the fair debutante into matrimony. After\nweeks of indecision Mr. Wharton finally arose and swore in accents\nterrible that she was going too far to be called back. He determined to\npush, not to pull, on the reins. Grover & Dickhut were commanded to get\nthe \"evidence\"; he would pay. When he burst in upon them and cried in his\ncracked treble that \"the devil's to pay,\" he did not mean to cast any\naspersion upon the profession in general or particular. He was annoyed.\n\n\"She's going away next week,\" he exclaimed, as if the lawyers were to\nblame for it.\n\n\"Well, and what of it?\" asked Mr. Grover blandly.\n\n\"Up into the mountains,\" went on Mr. Wharton triumphantly.\n\n\"Is it against the law?\" smiled the old lawyer.\n\n\"Confound the law! I don't object to her going up into the mountains for\na rest, but--\"\n\n\"It's much too hot in town for her, I fancy.\"\n\n\"How's that?\" querulously. \"But I've just heard that that scoundrel\nHavens is going to the mountains also.\"\n\n\"The same mountain?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I have absolute proof of it. Now, something has to be done!\"\n\nAnd so it was that the promising young lawyer, Samuel W. Rossiter, Jr.,\nwas sent northward into the Adirondacks one hot summer day with\ninstructions to be tactful but thorough. He had never seen Mrs. Wharton,\nnor had he seen Havens. There was no time to look up these rather\nimportant details, for he was off to intercept her at the little station\nfrom which one drove by coach to the quiet summer hotel among the clouds.\nShe was starting the same afternoon. He found himself wondering whether\nthis petted butterfly of fashion had ever seen him, and, seeing him, had\nbeen sufficiently interested to inquire, \"Who is that tall fellow with the\nlight hair?\" It would be difficult to perform the duties assigned to him\nif either she or Havens knew him for what he was. His pride would have\nbeen deeply wounded if he had known that Grover & Dickhut recommended him\nto Wharton as \"obscure.\"\n\n\"They say she is a howling beauty as well as a swell,\" reflected\nRossiter, as the miles and minutes went swinging by. \"And that's something\nto be thankful for. One likes novelty, especially if it's feminine. Well,\nI'm out for the sole purpose of saving a million or so for old Wharton,\nand to save as much of her reputation as I can besides. With the proof in\nhand the old duffer can scare her out of any claim against his bank\naccount, and she shall have the absolute promise of 'no exposure' in\nreturn. Isn't it lovely? Well, here's Albany. Now for the dinky road up to\nFossingford Station. I have an hour's wait here. She's coming on the\nafternoon train and gets to Fossingford at eleven-ten to-night. That's a\ndickens of a time for a young woman to be arriving anywhere, to say\nnothing of Fossingford.\"\n\nLoafing about the depot at Albany, Rossiter kept a close lookout for Mrs.\nWharton as he pictured her from the description he carried in his mind's\neye. Her venerable husband informed him that she was sure to wear a white\nshirt-waist, a gray skirt, and a Knox sailor hat, because her maid had\ntold him so in a huff. But he was to identify her chiefly by means of a\nhandsome and oddly trimmed parasol of deep purple. Wharton had every\nreason to suspect that it was a present from Havens, and therefore to be\ncarried more for sentiment than protection.\n\nA telegram awaited him at Fossingford Station. Fossingford was so small\nand unsophisticated that the arrival of a telegraphic message that did not\nrelate to the movement of railroad trains was an \"occasion.\" Everybody in\ntown knew that a message had come for Samuel Rossiter, and everybody was\nat the depot to see that he got it. The station agent had inquired at the\n\"eating-house\" for the gentleman, and that was enough. With the eyes of a\nFossingford score or two upon him, Rossiter read the despatch from Grover\n& Dickhut.\n\n\"Too bad, ain't it?\" asked the agent, compassionately regarding the\nnewcomer. Evidently the contents were supposed to be disappointing.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" replied Rossiter easily. But just the same he was\ntroubled in mind as he walked over and sat down upon his steamer trunk in\nthe shade of the building. The telegram read:\n\n\"She left New York five-thirty this evening. Stops over night Albany.\nFossingford to-morrow morning. Watch trains. Purple parasol. Sailor hat.\nGray travelling suit.\n\n\"G. and D.\"\n\nIt meant that he would be obliged to stay in Fossingford all night--but\nwhere? A general but comprehensive glance did not reveal anything that\nlooked like a hotel. He thought of going back to Albany for the night, but\nit suddenly occurred to him that she might not stop in that city, after\nall. Pulling his wits together, he saw things with a new clearness of\nvision. Ostensibly she had announced her intention to spend the month at\nEagle Nest, an obscure but delightful hotel in the hills; but did that\nreally mean that she would go there? It was doubtless a ruse to throw the\nhusband off the track. There were scores of places in the mountains, and\nit was more than probable that she would give Eagle Nest a wide berth.\nRossiter patted his bump of perceptiveness and smiled serenely until he\ncame plump up against the realization that she might not come by way of\nFossingford at all, or, in any event, she might go whisking through to\nsome station farther north. His speculations came to an end in the shape\nof a distressing resolution. He would remain in Fossingford and watch the\ntrains go by!\n\nAfter he had dashed through several early evening trains, the cheerful,\nphilosophical smile of courage left his face and trouble stared from his\neyes. He saw awkward prospects ahead. Suppose she were to pass through on\none of the late night trains! He could not rush through the sleepers, even\nthough the trains stopped in Fossingford for water.\n\nBesides, she could not be identified by means of a gray suit, a sailor\nhat, and a purple parasol if they were tucked away in the berth. At eleven\no'clock he was pacing the little depot platform, waiting for the\neleven-ten train, the last he was to inspect for the night. He had eaten\na scanty meal at the restaurant nearby, and was still mad about it. The\nstation agent slept soundly at his post, and all the rest of the town had\ngone to bed.\n\nThe train pulled in and out again, leaving him at the far end of the\nplatform, mopping his harassed brow. He had visited the chair-cars and had\nseen no one answering the description. A half-dozen passengers huddled off\nand wandered away in the darkness.\n\n\"I'll bet my head she's in one of those sleepers,\" he groaned, as he\nwatched the lights on the rear coach fade away into the night. \"It's all\noff till to-morrow, that's settled. My only hope is that she really\nstopped in Albany. There's a train through here at three in the morning;\nbut I'm not detective enough to unravel the mystery of any woman's berth.\nNow, where the deuce am _I_ to sleep?\"\n\nAs he looked about dismally, disconsolately, his hands deep in his\npockets, his straw hat pulled low over his sleepy eyes, the station agent\ncame up to him with a knowing grin on his face.\n\n\"'Scuse me, boss, but she's come,\" he said, winking.\n\n\"She? Who?\"\n\n\"Her. The young lady. Sure! She's lookin' fer you over in the\nwaitin'-room. You mus' 'a' missed her when she got off--thought she\nwasn't comin' up till to-morrer. Mus' 'a' changed her mind. That's\na woming all over, ain't it?\"\n\nRossiter felt himself turn hot and cold. His head began to whirl and his\ncourage went fluttering away. Here was a queer complication. The quarry\nhunting for the sleuth, instead of the reverse. He fanned himself with his\nhat for one brief, uncertain moment, dazed beyond belief. Then he\nresolutely strode over to face the situation, trusting to luck to keep him\nfrom blundering his game into her hands. Just as he was about to put his\nfoot upon the lamp-lit door-sill the solution struck him like a blow. She\nwas expecting Havens to meet her!\n\nThere was but one woman in the room, and she was approaching the door\nwith evident impatience as he entered. Both stopped short, she with a look\nof surprise, which changed to annoyance and then crept into an nervous,\napologetic little smile; he with an unsuppressed ejaculation. She wore a\ngray skirt, a white waist, and a sailor hat, and she was surpassingly good\nto look at even in the trying light from the overhead lamp. Instinctively\nhis eye swept over her. She carried on her arm the light gray jacket, and\nin one hand was the tightly rolled parasol of--he impertinently craned his\nneck to see--of purple! Mr. Rossiter was face to face with the woman he\nwas to dog for a month, and he was flabbergasted. Even as he stopped,\npuzzled, before her, contemplating retreat, she spoke to him.\n\n\"Did that man send you to me?\" she asked nervously, looking through the\ndoor beyond and then through a window at his right, quite puzzled, he\ncould see.\n\n\"He did, and I was sure he was mistaken. I knew of no one in this\nGod-forsaken place who could be asking for me,\" said he, collecting his\nwits carefully and herding them into that one sentence. \"But perhaps I\ncan help you. Will you tell me whom I am to look for?\"\n\n\"It is strange he is not here,\" she said a little breathlessly. \"I wired\nhim just what train to expect me on.\"\n\n\"Your husband?\" ventured he admirably.\n\n\"Oh, dear, no!\" said she quickly.\n\n\"I wish she'd wired me what train to expect her on,\" thought he grimly.\n\"She doesn't know me. That's good. She was expecting Havens and he's\nmissed connections somehow,\" shot rapidly through his brain. At the same\ntime he was thinking of her as the prettiest woman he had seen in all his\nlife. Then aloud: \"I'll look on the platform. Maybe he's lost in this\ngreat city. What name shall I call out?\"\n\n\"Please don't call very loudly. You'll wake the dead,\" she said, with a\npathetic smile. \"It's awfully good of you. He may come at any minute, you\nknow. His name is--is\"--she hesitated for a second, and then went on\ndeterminedly--\"Dudley. Tall, dark man. I don't know how I shall thank you.\nIt's so very awkward.\"\n\nRossiter darted from her glorious but perplexed presence. He had never\nseen Havens, but he was sure he could recognize an actor if he saw him in\nFossingford. And he would call him Dudley, too. It would be wise. The\nsearch was fruitless. The only tall, dark object he saw was the mailcrane\nat the edge of the platform, but he facetiously asked if its name was\nDudley. Receiving no answer, he turned back to cast additional woe into\nthe heart of the pretty intriguer. She was standing in the door, despair\nin her eyes. Somehow he was pleased because he had not found the wretch.\nShe was so fair to look upon and so appealing in her distress.\n\n\"You couldn't find him? What am I to do? Oh, isn't it awful? He promised\nto be here.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he's at a hotel.\"\n\n\"In Fossingford?\" in deep disgust. \"There's no hotel here. He was to\ndrive me to the home of a friend out in the country.\" Rossiter leaned\nagainst the wall suddenly. There was a long silence. He could not find his\ntongue, but his eyes were burning deep into the plaintive blue ones that\nlooked up into his face.\n\n\"I'll ask the agent,\" he said at last.\n\n\"Ask him what?\" she cried anxiously.\n\n\"If he's been here. No, I'll ask if there's a place where you can sleep\nto-night. Mr. Dudley will surely turn up to-morrow.\"\n\n\"But I couldn't sleep a wink. I feel like crying my eyes out,\" she wailed.\n\n\"Don't do that!\" exclaimed he, in alarm. \"I'll take another look outside.\"\n\n\"Please don't. He is not here. Will you please tell me what I am to\ndo?\"--very much as if it was his business to provide for her in the hour\nof need.\n\nRossiter promptly awoke the agent and asked him where a room could be\nprocured for the lady. Doxie's boarding-house was the only place,\naccording to the agent, and it was full to overflowing. Besides, they\nwould not \"take in\" strange women.\n\n\"She can sleep here in the waiting-room,\" suggested the agent. \"They'll\nlet you sleep in the parlor over at Doxie's, mister--maybe.\"\n\nRossiter did not have the heart to tell her all that the agent said. He\nmerely announced that there was no hotel except the depot waiting-room.\n\n\"By the way, does Mr. Dudley live out in the country?\" he asked\ninsidiously. She flushed and then looked at him narrowly.\n\n\"No. He's visiting his uncle up here.\"\n\n\"Funny he missed you.\"\n\n\"It's terribly annoying,\" she said coldly. Then she walked away from him\nas if suddenly conscious that she should not be conversing with a\ngood-looking stranger at such a time and place and under such peculiar\ncircumstances. He withdrew to the platform and his own reflections.\n\n\"He's an infernal cad for not meeting her,\" he found himself saying, her\npretty, distressed face still before him. \"I don't care a rap whether\nshe's doing right or wrong--she's game. Still, she's a blamed little fool\nto be travelling up here on such an outlandish train. So he's visiting an\nuncle, eh? Then the chances are they're not going to Eagle Nest. Lucky I\nwaited here--I'd have lost them entirely if I'd gone back to Albany. But\nwhere the deuce is she to sleep till morn--\" He heard rapid footsteps\nbehind him and turned to distinguish Mrs. Wharton as she approached dimly\nbut gracefully. The air seemed full of her.\n\n\"Oh, Mr.--Mr.--\" she was saying eagerly.\n\n\"Rollins.\"\n\n\"Isn't there a later train, Mr. Rollins?\"\n\n\"I'll ask the agent.\"\n\n\"There's the flyer at three-thirty A. M.,\" responded the sleepy agent a\nminute later.\n\n\"I'll just sit up and wait for it,\" she said coolly. \"He has got the\ntrains confused.\"\n\n\"Good heavens! Till three-thirty?\"\n\n\"But my dear Mr. Rollins, you won't be obliged to sit up, you know.\nYou're not expecting any one, are you?\"\n\n\"N-no, of course not.\"\n\n\"By the way, why _are_ you staying up?\" He was sure he detected\nalarm in the question. She was suspecting him!\n\n\"I have nowhere to go, Miss--Mrs.--er--\" She merely smiled and he said\nsomething under his breath. \"I'm waiting for the eight o'clock train.\"\n\n\"How lovely! What time will the three-thirty train get here, agent?\"\n\n\"At half-past three, I reckon. But she don't stop here!\"\n\n\"Oh, goodness! Can't you flag it--her, I mean?\"\n\n\"What's the use?\" asked Rossiter. \"He's not coming on it, is he?\"\n\n\"That's so. He's coming in a buggy. You needn't mind flagging her, agent.\"\n\n\"Well, say, I'd like to lock up the place,\" grumbled the agent. \"There's\nno more trains to-night but Number Seventeen, and she don't even whistle\nhere. I can't set up here all night.\"\n\n\"Oh, you wouldn't lock me out in the night, would you?\" she cried in such\npretty despair that he faltered.\n\n\"I got to git home to my wife. She's--\"\n\n\"That's all right, agent,\" broke in Rossiter hastily. \"I'll take your\nplace as agent. Leave the doors open and I'll go on watch. I have to stay\nup anyway.\"\n\nThere was a long silence. He did not know whether she was freezing or\nwarming toward him, because he dared not look into her eyes.\n\n\"I don't know who you are,\" she said distinctly but plaintively. It was\nvery dark out there on the platform and the night air was growing cold.\n\n\"It is the misfortune of obscurity,\" he said mockingly. \"I am a most\nhumble wayfarer on his way to the high hills. If it will make you feel any\nmore comfortable, madam, I will say that I don't know who you are. So, you\nsee, we are in the same boat. You are waiting for a man and I am waiting\nfor daylight. I sincerely trust you may not have as long to wait as I.\nBelieve me, I regard myself as a gentleman. You are quite as safe with me\nas you will be with the agent, or with Mr.--Mr. Dudley, for that matter.\"\n\n\"You may go home to your wife, Mr. Agent,\" she said promptly. \"Mr.\nRollins will let the trains through, I'm sure.\"\n\nThe agent stalked away in the night and the diminutive station was left\nto the mercy of the wayfarers.\n\n\"And now, Mr. Rollins, you may go over in that corner and stretch out on\nthe bench. It will be springless, I know, but I fancy you can sleep. I\nwill call you for the--for breakfast.\"\n\n\"I'm hanged if you do. On the contrary, I'm going to do my best to fix a\ncomfortable place for you to take a nap. I'll call you when Mr. Dudley\ncomes.\"\n\n\"It's most provoking of him,\" she said, as he began rummaging through his\nsteamer trunk. \"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"Hunting out something to make over into a mattress. You don't mind\nnapping on my clothes, do you? Here's a soft suit of flannels, a heavy\nsuit of cheviot, a dress suit, a spring coat, and a raincoat. I can rig up\na downy couch in no time if--\"\n\n\"Ridiculous! Do you imagine that I'm going to sleep on your best clothes?\nI'm going to sit up.\"\n\n\"You'll have to do as I say, madam, or be turned out of the hotel,\" said\nhe, with an infectious grin.\n\n\"But I insist upon your lying down. You have no reason for doing this for\nme. Besides, I'm going to sit up. Good-night!\"\n\n\"You are tired and ready to cry,\" he said, calmly going on with his\npreparations. She stood off defiantly and watched him pile his best\nclothes into a rather comfortable-looking heap on one of the long benches.\n\"Now, if you don't mind, I'll make a pillow of these negligee shirts.\nThey're soft, you know.\"\n\n\"Stop! I refuse to accept your--\" she was protesting.\n\n\"Do you want me to leave you here all alone?\" he demanded. \"With the\ncountry full of tramps and--\"\n\n\"Don't! It's cowardly of you to frighten me. They say the railroads are\nswarming with tramps, too. Won't you please go and see if Mr. Dudley is\nanywhere in sight?\"\n\n\"It was mean of me, I confess. Please lie down. It's getting cold. Pull\nthis raincoat over yourself. I'll walk out and--\"\n\n\"Oh, but you are a determined person. And very foolish, too. Why should\nyou lose a lot of sleep just for me when--?\"\n\n\"There is no reason why two men should fail you to-night, Mrs.--Miss--\"\n\n\"Miss Dering,\" she said, humbled.\n\n\"When you choose to retire, Miss Dering, you will find your room quite\nready,\" he said with fine gallantry, bowing low as he stood in the\ndoorway. \"I will be just outside on the platform, so don't be uneasy.\"\n\nHe quickly faded into the night, leaving her standing there, petulant,\nfurious, yet with admiration in her eyes. Ten minutes later he heard her\ncall. She was sitting on the edge of the improvised couch, smiling\nsweetly, even timidly.\n\n\"It must be cold out there. You must wear this.\"\n\nShe came toward him, the raincoat in one hand, the purple parasol in the\nother. He took the parasol only and departed without a word. She gasped\nand would have called after him, but there was no use. With a perplexed\nfrown and smile she went slowly, dubiously toward the folded bed.\n\nRossiter smoked three cigars and walked two miles up and down the\nplatform, swinging the parasol absent-mindedly, before he ventured to look\ninside the room again. In that time he had asked and answered many\nquestions in his mind. He saw that it would be necessary to change his\nplans if he was to watch her successfully. She evidently gave out Eagle\nNest to blind her husband. Somehow he was forgetting that the task before\nhim was disagreeable and undignified. What troubled him most was how to\nfollow them if Havens--or Dudley--put in an appearance for the\nthree-thirty train. He began to curse Everett Havens softly but potently.\n\nWhen he looked into the waiting-room she was sound asleep on the bench.\nIt delighted him to see that she had taken him at his word and was lying\nupon his clothes. Cautiously he took a seat on the door-sill. The night\nwas as still as death and as lonesome as the grave. For half an hour he\nsat gazing upon the tired, pretty face and the lithe young figure of the\nsleeper. He found himself dreaming, although he was wide awake--never more\nso. It occurred to him that he would be immensely pleased to hear that\nHavens's reason for failing her was due to an accident in which he had\nbeen killed.\n\n\"Those clothes will have to be pressed the first thing to-morrow,\" he\nsaid to himself, but without a trace of annoyance. \"Hang it all, she\ndoesn't look like that sort of woman,\" his mind switched. \"But just think\nof being tied up to an old crocodile like Wharton! Gee! One oughtn't to\nblame her!\"\n\nThen he went forth into the night once more and listened for the sound of\nbuggy wheels. It was almost time for the arrival of the belated man from\nthe country, and he was beginning to pray that he would not appear at all.\nIt came to his mind that he should advise her to return to New York in the\nmorning. At last his watch told him that the train was due to pass in five\nminutes. And still no buggy! Good! He felt an exhilaration that threatened\nto break into song.\n\nSoftly he stole back into the waiting-room, prepared to awaken her before\nthe train shot by. Something told him that the rumble and roar would\nterrify her if she were asleep. Going quite close to her he bent forward\nand looked long and sadly upon the perfect face. Her hair was somewhat\ndisarranged, her hat had a very hopeless tilt, her lashes swept low over\nthe smooth cheek, but there was an almost imperceptible choke in her\nbreathing. In her small white hand she clasped a handkerchief tightly,\nand--yes, he was sure of it--there were tear-stains beneath her lashes.\nThere came to him the faint sob which lingers long in the breath of one\nwho has cried herself to sleep. The spy passed his hand over his brow,\nsighed, shook his head and turned away irresolutely. He remembered that\nshe was waiting for a man who was not her husband.\n\nFar down the track a bright star came shooting toward Fossingford. He\nknew it to be the headlight of the flyer. With a breath of relief he saw\nthat he was the only human being on the platform. Havens had failed again.\nThis time he approached the recumbent one determinedly. She was awake the\ninstant he touched her shoulder.\n\n\"Oh,\" she murmured, sitting erect and looking about, bewildered. \"Is\nit--has he--oh, you are still here? Has he come?\"\n\n\"No, Miss Dering, he is not here,\" and added, under his breath, \"damn\nhim!\" Then aloud, \"The train is coming.\"\n\n\"And he didn't come?\" she almost wailed.\n\n\"I fancy you'd better try to sleep until morning. There's nothing to stay\nawake for,\" although it came with a pang.\n\n\"Absolutely nothing,\" she murmured, and his pride took a respectful tumble.\n\nAs she began to rearrange her hair, rather clumsily spoiling a charming\neffect, he remonstrated.\n\n\"Don't bother about your hair.\" She looked at him in wonder for an\ninstant, a little smile finally creeping to her lips. He felt that she\nunderstood something. \"Maybe he'll come after all,\" he added quickly.\n\n\"What are you doing with my parasol?\" she asked sleepily.\n\n\"I'm carrying it to establish your identity with Dudley if he happens to\ncome. He'll recognize the purple parasol, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see,\" she said dubiously. \"He gave it to me for a birthday present.\"\n\n\"I knew it,\" he muttered.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I mean I knew he'd recognize it,\" he explained.\n\nThe flyer shot through Fossingford at that juncture, a long line of\nroaring shadows. There was silence between them until the rumble was lost\nin the distance.\n\n\"If you don't mind, I'd like to go out on the platform for awhile,\" she\nsaid finally, resignation in her eyes. \"Perhaps he's out there, wondering\nwhy the train didn't stop.\"\n\n\"It's cold out there. Just slip into my coat, Miss Dering.\" He held the\nraincoat for her, and she mechanically slipped her arms into the sleeves.\nShe shivered, but smiled sweetly up at him.\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Rollins, you are very thoughtful and very kind to me.\"\n\nThey walked out into the darkness. After a turn or two in silence she\ntook the arm he proffered. He admired the bravery with which she was\ntrying to convince him that she was not so bitterly disappointed. When she\nfinally spoke her voice was soft and cool, just as a woman's always is\nbefore the break.\n\n\"He was to have taken me to his uncle's house, six miles up in the\ncountry. His aunt and a young lady from the South, with Mr. Dudley and me,\nare to go to Eagle Nest to-morrow for a month.\"\n\n\"How very odd,\" he said with well-assumed surprise. \"I, too, am going to\nEagle Nest for a month or so.\"\n\nShe stopped stock-still, and he could feel that she was staring at him\nhardly.\n\n\"You are going there?\" she half whispered.\n\n\"They say it is a quiet, restful place,\" he said. \"One reaches it by\nstage over-land, I believe.\" She was strangely silent during the remainder\nof the walk. Somehow he felt amazingly sorry for her. \"I hope I may see\nsomething of you while we are there,\" he said at last.\n\n\"I imagine I couldn't help it if I were to try,\" she said. They were in\nthe path of the light from the window, and he saw the strange little smile\non her face. \"I think I'll lie down again. Won't you find a place to\nsleep, Mr. Rollins? I can't bear the thought of depriving you--\"\n\n\"I am the slave of your darkness,\" he said gravely.\n\nShe left him, and he lit another cigar. Daylight came at last to break up\nhis thoughts, and then his tired eyes began to look for the man and buggy.\nFatigued and weary, he sat upon his steamer trunk, his back to the wall.\nThere he fell sound asleep.\n\nHe was awakened by some one shaking him gently by the shoulder.\n\n\"You are a very sound sleeper, Mr. Rollins,\" said a familiar voice, but\nit was gay and sprightly. He looked up blankly, and it was a full\nhalf-minute before he could get his bearings.\n\nA young woman with a purple parasol stood beside him, laughing merrily,\nand at her side was a tall, dark, very good-looking young man.\n\n\"I couldn't go without saying good-by to you, Mr. Rollins, and thanking\nyou again for the care you have taken of me,\" she was saying. He finally\nsaw the little gloved hand that was extended toward him. Her companion was\ncarrying her jacket and the little travelling-bag.\n\n\"Oh--er--good-by, and don't mention it,\" he stammered, struggling to his\nfeet. \"Was I asleep?\"\n\n\"Asleep at your post, sir. Mr. Dudley--oh, this is Mr. Dudley, Mr.\nRollins--came in ten minutes ago and found--us--both--asleep.\"\n\n\"Isn't it lucky Mr. Dudley happens to be an honest man?\" said Rossiter,\nin a manner so strange that the smile froze on the face of the other man.\nThe unhappy barrister caught the quick glance that passed between them,\nand was vaguely convinced that they had been discussing him while he\nslept. Something whispered to him that they had guessed the nature of his\nbusiness.\n\n\"My telegram was not delivered to him until this morning. Wasn't it\nprovoking?\" she was saying.\n\n\"What time is it now?\" asked Rossiter.\n\n\"Half-past seven,\" responded Dudley rather sharply. His black eyes were\nfastened steadily upon those of the questioner. \"Mr. Van Haltford's man\ncame in and got Miss Dering's telegram yesterday, but it was not delivered\nto me until a neighbor came to the house with both the message and\nmessenger in charge. Joseph had drunk all the whisky in Fossingford.\n\n\"Then there's no chance for me to get a drink, I suppose,\" said Rossiter\nwith a wry smile.\n\n\"Do you need one?\" asked Miss Dering saucily.\n\n\"I have a headache.\"\n\n\"A pick-me-up is what you want,\" said Dudley coldly.\n\n\"My dear sir, I haven't been drunk,\" remonstrated Rossiter sharply. His\nhearers laughed and he turned red but cold with resentment.\n\n\"See, Mr. Rollins, I have smoothed out your clothes and folded them,\" she\nsaid, pointing to her one-time couch. \"I couldn't pack them in your trunk\nbecause you were sitting on it. Shall I help you now?\"\n\n\"No, I thank you,\" he said ungraciously. \"I can toss 'em in any old way.\"\n\nHe set about doing it without another word. His companions stood over\nnear the window and conversed earnestly in words too low for him to\ndistinguish. From the corner of his eye he could see that Dudley's face\nwas hard and uncompromising, while hers was eager and imploring. The man\nwas stubbornly objecting to something, and she was just as decided in an\nopposite direction.\n\n\"He's finding fault and she's trying to square it with him. Oh, my\nbeauties, you'll have a hard time to shake off one Samuel Rossiter.\nThey're suspicious--or he is, at least. Some one has tipped me off to\nthem, I fancy.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry they are so badly mussed, Mr. Rollins, but they did make a\nvery comfortable bed,\" she said, walking over to him. Her cheeks were\nflushed and her eyes were gleaming. \"You are going to Eagle Nest to-day?\"\n\n\"Just as soon as I can get a conveyance. There is a stage-coach at nine,\nMiss Dering.\"\n\n\"We will have room for you on our break,\" she said simply. Her eyes met\nhis bravely and then wavered. Rossiter's heart gave a mighty leap.\n\n\"Permit me to second Miss Dering's invitation,\" said Dudley, coming over.\nThe suggestion of a frown on his face made Rossiter only too eager to\naccept the unexpected invitation. \"My aunt and Miss Crozier are outside\nwith the coachman. You can have your luggage sent over in the stage. It is\nfourteen miles by road, so we should be under way, Mr. Rollins.\"\n\nAs Rossiter followed them across the platform he was saying to himself:\n\n\"Well, the game's on. Here's where I begin to earn my salary. I'll hang\nout my sign when I get back to New York: 'Police Spying. Satisfaction\nguaranteed. References given.' Hang it all, I hate to do this to her.\nShe's an awfully good sort, and--and--But I don't like this damned Havens!\"\n\nAlmost before he knew it he was being presented to two handsome,\nfashionably dressed young women who sat together in the rear seat of the\nbig mountain break.\n\n\"Every cloud has its silver lining,\" Miss Dering was saying. \"Let me\npresent you to Mr. Dudley's aunt, Mrs. Van Haltford, and to Miss Crozier,\nMr. Rollins.\"\n\nIn a perfect maze of emotions, he found himself bowing before the two\nladies, who smiled distantly and uncertainly. Dudley's aunt? That dashing\nyoung creature his aunt? Rossiter was staggered by the boldness of the\nclaim. He could scarce restrain the scornful, brutal laugh of derision at\nthis ridiculous play upon his credulity. To his secret satisfaction he\ndiscovered that the entire party seemed nervous and ill at ease. There was\na trace of confusion in their behavior. He heard Miss Dering explain that\nhe was to accompany the party and he saw the poorly concealed look of\ndisapproval and polite inquiry that went between the two ladies and\nDudley. There was nothing for it, however, now that Miss Dering had\ncommitted herself, and he was advised to look to his luggage without delay.\n\nHe hurried into the station to arrange for the transportation of his\ntrunk by stage, all the while smiling maliciously in his sleeve. Looking\nsurreptitiously from a window he saw the quartet, all of them now on the\nbreak, arguing earnestly over--him, he was sure. Miss Dering was\nplaintively facing the displeasure of the trio. The coachman's averted\nface wore a half-grin. The discussion ended abruptly as Rossiter\nreappeared, but there was a coldness in the air that did not fail to\nimpress him as portentous.\n\n\"I'm the elephant on their hands--the proverbial hot coal,\" he thought\nwickedly. \"Well, they've got to bear it even if they can't grin.\" Then\naloud cheerily: \"All aboard! We're off!\" He took his seat beside the\ndriver. The events of the ensuing week are best chronicled by the\nreproduction of Rossiter's own diary or report, with liberties in the\nshape of an author's comments.\n\n\nTHURSDAY.\n\n\n\"Settled comfortably in Eagle Nest House. Devilish rugged and\nout-of-the-way place. Mrs. Van Haltford is called Aunt Josephine. She and\nMiss Debby Crozier have rooms on the third floor. Mine is next to theirs,\nHavens's is next to mine, and Mrs. Wharton has two rooms beyond his. We\nare not unlike a big family party. They're rather nice to me. I go\nwalking with Aunt Josephine. I don't understand why I'm sandwiched in\nbetween Havens and Aunt Josephine. Otherwise the arrangement is neat.\nThere is a veranda outside our windows. We sit upon it. Aunt Josephine\nis a great bluff, but she's clever. She's never napping. I've tried to\npump her. Miss Crozier is harmless. She doesn't care. Havens never takes\nhis eyes off Mrs. W. when they are together. She looks at him a good bit,\ntoo. They don't pay much attention to me. Aunt Josephine's husband is\nvery old and very busy. He can't take vacations. Everybody went to bed\nearly to-night. No evidence to-day.\"\n\n\nFRIDAY NIGHT.\n\n\n\"Havens and Mrs. W. went hill-climbing this afternoon and were gone for\nan hour before I missed them. Then I took Aunt Jo and Debby out for a\nquick climb. Confound Aunt Jo! She got tired in ten minutes and Debby\nwouldn't go on without her. I think it was a put-up job. The others didn't\nreturn till after six. She asked me if I'd like to walk about the grounds\nafter dinner. Said I would. We did. Havens went with us. Couldn't shake\nhim to save my life.\"\n\n\nSATURDAY NIGHT.\n\n\n\"I have to watch myself constantly to keep from calling her Mrs. Wharton.\nI believe writing her real name is bad policy. It makes me forget. After\nthis I shall call her Miss Dering, and I'll speak of him as Dudley. This\nmorning he asked me to call him 'Jim.' He calls me 'Sam.' Actors do get\nfamiliar. When she came downstairs to go driving with him this morning\nI'll swear she was the prettiest thing I ever saw. They took a lunch and\nwere gone for hours. I'd like to punch his face. She was very quiet all\nevening, and I fancied she avoided me. I smelt liquor on his breath just\nbefore bedtime.\n\n\"_One A. M._--I thought everybody had gone to bed, but they are out\nthere on the veranda talking. Just outside her windows. I distinctly heard\nhim call her 'dearest.' Something must have alarmed them, for they parted\nabruptly. He walked the veranda for an hour, all alone. Plenty of\nevidence.\"\n\n\nSUNDAY NIGHT.\n\n\n\"For appearance's sake he took Miss Crozier for a walk to-day. I went to\nthe chapel down the hill with Miss Dering and Aunt Josephine. Aunt\nJosephine put a ten-dollar bill in the box. Thinks she's squaring herself\nwith the Lord, I suppose. Miss Dering was not at all talkative and gave\nevery sign of being uncomfortable because he had the audacity to go\nwalking with another girl. In the afternoon she complained of being ill\nand went to her room. Later on she sent for Dudley and Mrs. Van Haltford.\nThey were in her room all afternoon. I smoked on the terrace with Debby.\nShe is the most uninteresting girl I ever met. But she's on to their game.\nI know it because she forgot herself once, when I mentioned Miss Dering's\nillness, and said: 'Poor girl! She is in a most trying position. Don't you\nthink Mr. Dudley is a splendid fellow?' I said that he was very\ngood-looking, and she seemed to realize she had said something she ought\nnot to have said and shut up. I'm sorry she's sick, though. I miss that\nparasol dreadfully. She always has it, and I can see her a mile away.\nUsually he carries it, though. Well, I suppose he has a right--as original\nowner. Jim and I smoked together this evening, but he evidently smells a\nmouse. He did not talk much, and I caught him eying me strangely several\ntimes.\"\n\n\nMONDAY NIGHT.\n\n\n\"Dudley has departed. I believe they are on to me. He went to Boston this\nafternoon, and he actually was gruff with me just before leaving. The size\nof the matter is, some one has posted him, and they are all up to my game\nas a spy. I wish I were out of it. Never was so ashamed of a thing in my\nlife; don't feel like looking any one in the face. They've all been nice\nto me. But what's the difference? They're all interested. She went to the\ntrain with him and--the rest of us. I'll never forget how sad she looked\nas she held his hand and bade him good-by. I carried the parasol back to\nthe hotel, and I know I hurt her feelings when I maliciously said that it\nwould look well with a deep black border. She almost looked a hole through\nme. Fine eyes. I don't know what is coming next. She is liable to slip out\nfrom under my eye at any time and fly away to meet him somewhere else. I\ntelegraphed this message to Grover & Dickhut:\n\n\"He has gone. She still here. What shall I do?\n\n\"Got this answer:\n\n\"Stay there and watch. They suspect you. Don't let her get away.\n\n\"But how the devil am I to watch day and night?\"\n\nThe next week was rather an uneventful one for Rossiter. There was no\nsign of Havens and no effort on her part to leave Eagle Nest.\n\nAs the days went by he became more and more vigilant. In fact, his watch\nwas incessant and very much of a personal one. He walked and drove with\nher, and he invented all sorts of excuses to avoid Mrs. Van Haltford and\nMiss Crozier. The purple parasol and he had become almost inseparable\nfriends. The fear that Havens might return at any time kept him in a fever\nof anxiety and dread. Now that he was beginning to know her for himself he\ncould not endure the thought that she cared for another man. Strange to\nsay, he did not think of her husband. Old Wharton had completely faded\nfrom his mind; it was Havens that he envied. He saw himself sinking into\nher net, falling before her wiles, but he did not rebel.\n\nHe went to bed each night apprehensive that the next morning should find\nhim alone and desolate at Eagle Nest, the bird flown. It hurt him to think\nthat she would laugh over her feat of outwitting him. He was not guarding\nher for old Wharton now; he was in his own employ. All this time he knew\nit was wrong, and that she was trifling with him while the other was away.\nYet he had eyes, ears, and a heart like all men, and they were for none\nsave the pretty wife of Godfrey Wharton.\n\nHe spoke to her on several occasions of Dudley and gnashed his teeth when\nhe saw a look of sadness, even longing, come into her dark eyes. At such\ntimes he was tempted to tell her that he knew all, to confound her by\ncharging her with guilt. But he could not collect the courage. For some\nunaccountable reason he held his bitter tongue. And so it was that\nhandsome Sam Rossiter, spy and good fellow, fell in love with a woman who\nhad a very dark page in her history.\n\nShe received mail, of course, daily, but he was not sneak enough to pry\ninto its secrets, even had the chance presented itself. Sometimes she\ntossed the letters away carelessly, but he observed that there were some\nwhich she guarded jealously.\n\nOnce he heard her tell Aunt Josephine that she had a letter from \"Jim.\"\nHe began to discover that \"Jim\" was a forbidden subject and that he was\nnot discussed; at least, not in his presence. Many times he saw the two\nwomen in earnest, rather cautious conversation, and instinctively felt\nthat Havens was the subject. Mrs. Wharton appeared piqued and discontented\nafter these little talks. He made this entry in his diary one night, a\nweek after Havens went away:\n\n\"I almost wish he'd come back and end the suspense. This thing is wearing\non me. I was weighed to-day and I've lost ten pounds. Mrs. Van Haltford\nsays I look hungry and advises me to try salt-water air. I'm hanged if I\ndon't give up the job this week. I don't like it, anyhow. It doesn't seem\nsquare to be down here enjoying her society, taking her walking and all\nthat, and all the time hunting up something with which to ruin her\nforever. I'll stick the week out, but I'm not decided whether I'll produce\nany evidence against her if the Wharton _vs._ Wharton case ever does\ncome to trial. I don't believe I could. I don't want to be a sneak.\"\n\nOne day Rossiter and the purple parasol escorted the pretty trifler over\nthe valley to Bald Top, half a mile from the hotel. Mrs. Van Haltford and\nMiss Crozier were to join them later and were to bring with them Colonel\nDeming and Mr. Vincent, two friends who had lately arrived. The hotel was\nrapidly filling with fashionable guests, and Mrs. Wharton had petulantly\nobserved, a day or two before, that the place was getting crowded and she\nbelieved she would go away soon. On the way over she said to him:\n\n\"I have about decided to go down to Velvet Springs for the rest of the\nmonth. Don't you think it is getting rather crowded here?\"\n\n\"I have been pretty well satisfied,\" he replied, in an injured tone. \"I\ndon't see why you should want to leave here.\"\n\n\"Why should I stay if I am tired of the place?\" she asked demurely,\ncasting a roguish glance at his sombre face. He clenched the parasol and\ngrated his teeth.\n\n\"She's leading me on, confound her!\" he thought. At the same time his\nhead whirled and his heart beat a little faster. \"You shouldn't,\" he said,\n\"if you are tired. There's more of an attraction at Velvet Springs, I\nsuppose.\"\n\n\"Have you been there?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You answered rather snappishly. Have you a headache?\"\n\n\"Pardon me; I didn't intend to answer snappishly, as you call it. I only\nwanted to be brief.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I wanted to change the subject.\"\n\n\"Shall we talk of the weather?\"\n\n\"I suppose we may as well,\" he said resignedly. She was plainly laughing\nat him now. \"Look here,\" he said, stopping and looking into her eyes\nintently and somewhat fiercely, \"why do you want to go to Velvet Springs?\"\n\n\"Why should you care where I go?\" she answered blithely, although her\neyes wavered.\n\n\"It's because you are unhappy here and because some one else is there.\nI'm not blind, Mrs.--Miss Dering.\"\n\n\"You have no right to talk to me in that manner, Mr. Rollins. Come, we\nare to go back to the hotel at once,\" she said coldly. There was steel in\nher eyes.\n\nHe met her contemptuous look for a moment and quailed.\n\n\"I beg your pardon. I am a fool, but you have made me such,\" he said\nbaldly.\n\n\"I? I do not understand you,\" and he could not but admire the clever,\ninnocent, widespread eyes.\n\n\"You will understand me some day,\" he said, and to his amazement she\nflushed and looked away. They continued their walk, but there was a\nstrange shyness in her manner that puzzled him.\n\n\"When is Dudley expected back here?\" he asked abruptly.\n\nShe started sharply and gave him a quick, searching look. There was a\nguilty expression in her eyes, and he muttered something ugly under his\nbreath.\n\n\"I do not know, Mr. Rollins,\" she answered.\n\n\"When did you hear from him last?\" he demanded half savagely.\n\n\"I do not intend to be catechized by you, sir,\" she exclaimed, halting\nabruptly. \"We shall go back. You are very ugly to-day and I am surprised.\"\n\n\"I supposed you had letters from him every day,\" he went on ruthlessly.\nShe gave him a look in which he saw pain and the shadow of tears, and then\nshe turned and walked swiftly toward the hotel. His conscience smote him\nand he turned after her. For the next ten minutes he was on his knees,\nfiguratively, pleading for forgiveness. At last she paused and smiled\nsweetly into his face. Then she calmly turned and resumed the journey to\nBald Top, saying demurely:\n\n\"We have nearly a quarter of a mile to retrace, all because you were so\nhateful.\"\n\n\"And you so obdurate,\" he added blissfully. He had tried to be severe and\nangry with her and had failed.\n\nThat very night the expected came to pass. Havens appeared on the scene,\nthe same handsome, tragic-looking fellow, a trifle care-worn perhaps, but\nstill--an evil genius. Rossiter ran plump into him in the hallway and was\nspeechless for a moment. He unconsciously shook hands with the new\narrival, but his ears were ringing so with the thuds of his heart that he\nheard but few of the brisk words addressed to him. After the eager actor\nhad left him standing humbly in the hall he managed to recall part of what\nhad been said. He had come up on the express from Boston and could stay\nbut a day or two. Did Mr. Rossiter know whether Miss Dering was in her\nroom? The barrister also distinctly remembered that he did not ask for his\naunt, which would have been the perfectly natural query.\n\nHalf an hour later Havens was strolling about the grounds, under the lamp\nlights, in and out of dark nooks, and close beside him was a slim figure\nin white. Their conversation was earnest, their manner secretive; that\nmuch the harassed Rossiter could see from the balcony. His heart grew sore\nand he could almost feel the tears of disappointment surging to his eyes.\nA glance in his mirror had shown him a face haggard and drawn, eyes\nstrange and bright. He had not slept well, he knew; he had worn himself\nout in this despicable watch; he had grown to care for the creature he had\nbeen hired to spy upon. No wonder he was haggard.\n\nNow he was jealous--madly, fiendishly jealous. In his heart there was the\nsavage desire to kill the other man and to denounce the woman. Pacing the\ngrounds about the hotel, he soon worked himself into a fever, devilish in\nits hotness. More than once he passed them, and it was all he could do to\nrefrain from springing upon them. At length he did what most men do: he\ntook a drink. Whisky flew down his throat and to his brain. In his mind's\neye he saw her in the other's arms--and he could bear it no longer!\nRushing to his room, he threw himself on the bed and cursed.\n\n\"Good heaven! I love her! I love her better than all the world! I can't\nstay here and see any more of it! By thunder, I'll go back to New York and\nthey can go to the devil! So can old Wharton! And so can Grover & Dickhut!\"\n\nHe leaped to his feet, dashed headlong to the telegraph office\ndownstairs, and ten minutes later this message was flying to Grover &\nDickhut:\n\nGet some one else for this job. I'm done with it. Coming home.--SAM.\n\n\"I'm coming on the first train, too,\" muttered the sender, as he hurried\nup-stairs. \"I can pack my trunk for the night stage. I'd like to say\ngood-by to her, but I can't--I couldn't stand it. What's the difference?\nShe won't care whether I go or stay--rather have me go. If I were to meet\nher now I'd--yes, by George--kiss her! It's wrong to love her, but--\"\n\nThere was nothing dignified about the manner in which big Sam Rossiter\npacked his trunk. He fairly stamped the clothing into it and did a lot of\nother absurd things. When he finally locked it and yanked out his watch\nhis brow was wet and he was trembling. It had taken just five minutes to\ndo the packing. His hat was on the back of his head, his collar was\nmelting, and his cigar was chewed to a pulp. Cane and umbrella were yanked\nfrom behind the door and he was ready to fly. The umbrella made him think\nof a certain parasol, and his heart grew still and cold with the knowledge\nthat he was never to carry it again.\n\n\"I hope I don't meet any of 'em,\" he muttered, pulling himself together\nand rushing into the hall. A porter had already jerked his trunk down the\nstair steps.\n\nAs he hastened after it he heard the swish of skirts and detected in the\nair a familiar odor, the subtle scent of a perfume that he could not\nforget were he to live a thousand years. The next moment she came swiftly\naround a corner in the hall, hurrying to her rooms. They met and both\nstarted in surprise, her eyes falling to his travelling-bag, and then\nlifting to his face in bewilderment. He checked his hurried flight and she\ncame quite close to him. The lights in the hall were dim and the elevator\ncar had dropped to regions below.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" she asked in some agitation.\n\n\"I am going back to New York,\" he answered, controlling himself with an\neffort. She was so beautiful, there in the dim hallway.\n\n\"To-night?\" she asked in very low tones.\n\n\"In half an hour.\"\n\n\"And were you going without saying good-by to--to us?\" she went on rapidly.\n\nHe looked steadily down into her solemn eyes for a moment and an\nexpression of pain, of longing, came into his own.\n\n\"It couldn't make any difference whether I said good-by to you, and it\nwould have been hard,\" he replied unsteadily.\n\n\"Hard? I don't understand you,\" she said.\n\n\"I didn't want to see you. Yes, I hoped to get away before you knew\nanything about it. Maybe it was cowardly, but it was the best way,\" he\ncried bitterly.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she cried, and he detected alarm, confusion, guilt in\nher manner.\n\n\"You know what I mean. I know everything--I knew it before I came here,\nbefore I saw you. It's why I am here, I'm ashamed to say. But, have no\nfear--have no fear! I've given up the job--the nasty job--and you can do\nas you please. The only trouble is that I have been caught in the web;\nI've been trapped myself. You've made me care for you. That's why I'm\ngiving it all up. Don't look so frightened--I'll promise to keep your\nsecret.\"\n\nHer eyes were wide, her lips parted, but no words came; she seemed to\nshrink from him as if he were the headsman and she his victim.\n\n\"I'll do it, right or wrong!\" he gasped suddenly. And in an instant his\nsatchel clattered to the floor and his arms were straining the slight\nfigure to his breast. Burning lips met hers and sealed them tight. She\nshivered violently, struggled for an instant in his mad embrace, but made\nno outcry. Gradually her free arm stole upward and around his neck and her\nlips responded to the passion in his. His kiss of ecstasy was returned.\nThe thrill of joy that shot through him was almost overpowering. A dozen\ntimes he kissed her. Unbelieving, he held her from him and looked hungrily\ninto her eyes. They were wet with tears.\n\n\"Why do you go? I love you!\" she whispered faintly.\n\nThen came the revulsion. With an oath he threw her from him. Her hands\nwent to her temples and a moan escaped her lips.\n\n\"Bah!\" he snarled. \"Get away from me! Heaven forgive me for being as weak\nas I've been to-night!\"\n\n\"Sam!\" she wailed piteously.\n\n\"Don't tell me anything! Don't try to explain! Be honest with one man, at\nleast!\"\n\n\"You must be insane!\" she cried tremulously.\n\n\"Don't play innocent, madam. I _know_.\" In abject terror she shrank\naway from him. \"But I have kissed you! If I live a thousand years I shall\nnot forget its sweetness.\"\n\nHe waved his hands frantically above her, grabbed up his suit-case and\ntraps, and, with one last look at the petrified woman shrinking against\nthe wall under the blasts of his vituperation, he dashed for the stairway.\nAnd so he left her, a forlorn, crushed figure.\n\nBlindly he tore downstairs and to the counter. He hardly knew what he was\ndoing as he drew forth his pocket-book to pay his account.\n\n\"Going away, Mr. Rollins?\" inquired the clerk, glancing at the clock. It\nwas eleven-twenty and the last stage-coach left for Fossingford at\neleven-thirty, in time to catch the seven o'clock down train.\n\n\"Certainly,\" was the excited answer.\n\n\"A telegram came a few moments ago for you, sir, but I thought you were\nin bed,\" and the other tossed a little envelope out to him. Mechanically\nRossiter tore it open. He was thinking of the cowering woman in the\nhallway and he was cursing himself for his brutality.\n\nHe read the despatch with dizzy eyes and drooping jaw, once, twice,\nthrice. Then he leaned heavily against the counter and a coldness assailed\nhis heart, so bitter that he felt his blood freezing. It read:\n\nWhat have you been doing? The people you were sent to watch sailed for\nEurope ten days ago.\n\n       GROVER & DICKHUT.\n\nThe paper fell from his trembling fingers, but he regained it, natural\ninstinct inspiring a fear that the clerk would read it.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" he gasped.\n\n\"Bad news, Mr. Rollins?\" asked the clerk sympathetically, but the\nstricken, bewildered man did not answer.\n\nWhat did it mean? A vast faintness attacked him as the truth began to\npenetrate. Out of the whirling mystery came the astounding, ponderous\nrealization that he had blundered, that he had wronged her, that he had\naccused her of--Oh, that dear, stricken figure in the hallway above!\n\nHe leaped to the staircase. Three steps at a time he flew back to the\nscene of the miserable tragedy. What he thought, what he felt as he rushed\ninto the hallway can only be imagined. She was gone--heartbroken, killed!\nAnd she had kissed him and said she loved him!\n\nA light shone through the transoms over the doors that led into her\napartments. Quaking with fear, he ran down the hall and beat a violent\ntattoo upon her parlor door. Again he rapped, crazed by remorse, fear,\nlove, pity, shame, and a hundred other emotions.\n\n\"Who is it?\" came in stifled tones from within.\n\n\"It is I--Rossiter--I mean Rollins! I must see you--now! For pity's sake,\nlet me in!\"\n\n\"How dare you--\" she began shrilly; but he was not to be denied.\n\n\"If you don't open this door I'll kick it in!\" he shouted. \"I must see\nyou!\"\n\nAfter a moment the door flew open and he stood facing her. She was like a\nqueen. Her figure was as straight as an arrow, her eyes blazing. But there\nhad been tears in them a moment before.\n\n\"Another insult!\" she exclaimed, and the scorn in her voice was\nwithering. He paused abashed, for the first time realizing that he had\nhurt her beyond reparation. His voice faltered and the tears flew to his\neyes.\n\n\"I don't know what to say to you. It has been a mistake--a frightful\nmistake--and I don't know whether you'll let me explain. When I got\ndownstairs I found this telegram and--for heaven's sake, let me tell you\nthe wretched story. Don't turn away from me! You shall listen to me if I\nhave to hold you!\" His manner changed suddenly to the violent, imperious\nforcefulness of a man driven to the last resort.\n\n\"Must I call for help?\" she cried, thoroughly alarmed, once more the weak\nwoman, face to face, as she thought, with an insane man.\n\n\"I love you better than my own life, and I've hurt you terribly. I'm not\ncrazy, Helen! But I've been a fool, and I'll go crazy if you don't give me\na chance to explain.\"\n\nWhether she gave the chance or no he took it, and from his eager,\npleading lips raced the whole story of his connection with the Wharton\naffair from first to last.\n\nHe humbled himself, accused himself, ridiculed himself, and wound up by\nthrowing himself upon her mercy, uttering protestations of the love which\nhad really been his undoing.\n\nShe heard him through without a word. The light in her eyes changed; the\nfear left them and the scorn fled. Instead there grew, by stages, wonder,\nincredulity, wavering doubt and--joy. She understood him and she loved\nhim! The awful horror of that meeting in the hallway was swept away like\nunto the transformation scene in the fairy spectacle.\n\nWhen he fell upon his knee and sought to clasp her fingers in his cold\nhand she smiled, and, stooping over, placed both hands on his cheeks and\nkissed him.\n\nWhat followed her kiss of forgiveness may be more easily imagined than\ntold.\n\n\"You see it was perfectly natural for me to mistake you for Mrs.\nWharton,\" he said after awhile. \"You had the gray jacket, the sailor hat,\nthe purple parasol, and you are beautiful. And, besides all that, you were\nfound red-handed in that ridiculous town of Fossingford. Why shouldn't I\nhave suspected you with such a preponderance of evidence against you?\nAnybody who would get off of a night train in Fossingford certainly ought\nto be ashamed of something.\"\n\n\"But Fossingford is on the map, isn't it? One has a perfect right to get\noff where she likes, hasn't she, provided it is on the map?\"\n\n\"Not at all! That's what maps are for: to let you see where you don't get\noff.\"\n\n\"But I was obliged to get off there. My ticket said 'Fossingford,' and,\nbesides, I was to be met at the station in a most legitimate manner. You\nhad no right to jump at conclusions.\"\n\n\"Well, if you had not descended to earth at Fossingford I wouldn't be in\nheaven at Eagle Nest. Come to think of it, I believe you did quite the\nproper thing in getting off at Fossingford--no matter what the hour.\"\n\n\"You must remember always that I have not taken you to task for a most\nflagrant piece of--shall I say indiscretion?\"\n\n\"Good Heavens!\"\n\n\"You stopped off at Fossingford for the sole purpose of seeing another\nwoman.\"\n\n\"That's all very fine, dear, but you'll admit that Dudley was an\nexcellent substitute for Havens. Can't you see how easy it was to be\nmistaken?\"\n\n\"I won't fall into easy submission. Still, I believe I could recommend\nyou as a detective. They usually do the most unheard of things--just as\nyou have. Poor Jim Dudley an actor! Mistaken for such a man as you say\nHavens is! It is even more ridiculous than that I should be mistaken for\nMrs. Wharton.\"\n\n\"Say, I'd like to know something about Dudley. It was his confounded\ndevotion to you that helped matters along in my mind. What is he to you?\"\n\n\"He came here to-night to repeat a question that had been answered\nunalterably once before. Jim Dudley? Have you never heard of James Dudley,\nthe man who owns all of those big mines in South America, the man who--\"\n\n\"Who owns the yachts and automobiles and--and the railroad trains? Is he\nthe one? The man with the millions? Good Lord! And you could have had him\ninstead of me? Helen, I--I don't understand it. Why didn't you take him?\"\n\nShe hesitated a moment before answering brightly:\n\n\"Perhaps it is because I have a fancy for the ridiculous.\"\n\n\nTHE END",
