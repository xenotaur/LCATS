    "body": "When Martin Devere was 23 and still working on his Master's, he was\nhurt by a woman. It was then that he decided that the only things\nthat were worthwhile in life were pure art and pure science. That, of\ncourse, is another story, but it may explain why he chose to become an\narcheologist in the first place.\n\nNow he was the oldest human being on Mars. He was 91. For many years,\nin fact, he had been the _only_ human being on Mars. Up until today.\n\nHe looked through the transparent wall of his pressurized igloo at the\npuff of dust in the desert where the second rocket had come down. Earth\nand Mars were just past conjunction, and the regular automatic supply\nrocket had landed two days ago. As usual, Martin Devere, taking his\nown good time about it, had unloaded the supplies, keeping the things\nhe really needed and throwing away the useless stuff like the latest\nmicrofilmed newspapers and magazines, the taped TV shows and concerts.\nAs payment for his groceries he had then reloaded the rocket with the\nwritten reports he had accumulated since the last conjunction, plus a\nfew artifacts.\n\nThen he had pushed a button and sent the rocket on its way again, back\nto Earth. He didn't mind writing the reports. Most of them were rubbish\nanyway, but they seemed to keep the people back at the Institute happy.\nHe did mind the artifacts. It seemed wrong to remove them, though he\nsent only the less valuable ones back. But perhaps it couldn't be\nhelped. One time, the supply rocket had failed to return when he pushed\nits red button--the thing was still sitting out there in the desert,\nslowly rusting. Martin Devere had happily unloaded the artifacts and\nput them back where they belonged. It wasn't his fault.\n\nThe puff of dust on the horizon was beginning to settle. This second\nrocket had descended with a shrill scream through the thin air, its\nvoice more highly pitched than it would have been in denser atmosphere.\nMartin Devere had looked up from his work in time to see its braking\njets vanish behind the low Martian hills a few kilometers distant.\n\nIt was much too large to be an automatic supply rocket, even if there\nhad been reason to expect another one. Martin Devere knew it could mean\nonly one thing--someone was paying him an unannounced visit.\n\nHe waited, watching through the igloo wall to see who had come to poke\naround and bother him after all these years.\n\nAt first he was annoyed that the people at the Institute hadn't let him\nknow visitors were coming. Then he reminded himself that it had been\nyears since he'd taken the trouble to listen to his radio receiver, or\nto read the messages they sent him along with supplies.\n\nAfter a long time, he made out a smaller dust-puff, and then a little\nsandcat advancing slowly across the desert. Riding on top of it were\ntwo men in space suits.\n\n\n\nEveryone on Earth who reads popular magazines or watches TV knows the\nstory of Martin Devere, \"The Hermit of Mars.\" Over the years, now that\nhe is dead, he has become a sort of culture hero, as Dr. Livingston or\nAlbert Schweitzer once were. Though Martin Devere could not be called\na humanitarian in any sense of the word. After his divorce from his\nfirst and only wife, at the age of 45, he never gave much thought again\neither to women or any other kind of people--except for his long-dead\nMartians.\n\nBut everyone should know by now how Martin Devere first came to Mars\nat the age of 50. Even then he was the oldest man on the planet,\nand Mars sustained quite a large research colony at the time. Only\nMartin Devere's unchallenged scientific reputation, together with his\napparent good health, enabled him to leave Earth as head of a five-man\narcheological team. This turned up the first fossil ruins far beneath\nthe desert sand.\n\nThen there came a day when the Space Institute of the United\nGovernments decided to abandon Project Mars. It was getting too\nexpensive to maintain. Everything of value to space research had\nalready been learned about the planet, and the archeological site,\nthough yet barely scratched, did not properly come under space\nresearch. Closing Project Mars would mean more funds for solar\nresearch, on Mercury, for the Lunar colony and for work on the\ninterstellar drive.\n\nSo the hundred-odd inhabitants of the Project received orders to leave\nthe igloos and other equipment behind and come back to Earth.\n\nMartin Devere, however, had been on Mars for three years now. When the\nProject physician gave him his routine exam, it was discovered that a\nvalve in Martin Devere's aorta had developed a faint flutter. Nothing\ntoo serious, really. But enough to greatly reduce his chances of\nsurviving another rocket lift-off.\n\nMartin Devere smiled at the news and volunteered to remain behind,\nalone on Mars. Under the circumstances, the Institute was forced to\nagree.\n\nOn the day that the strange rocket came down behind the desert hills,\nMartin Devere had been on Mars for a total of 38 years. For the past 35\nof them he had been The Hermit--and quite happy about it....\n\nThe little sandcat was getting closer. Martin Devere smiled to himself,\nwatching the two men in their clumsy space gear. It was high noon, and\na nice comfortable ten degrees centigrade outside. If the two newcomers\nthought they needed full spacesuits to get around out there, Martin\nDevere wasn't going to tell them any different. Actually, though the\natmospheric pressure was about the same as at the top of Mount Everest,\non a beautiful day like this a man could get along easily outdoors with\nnothing more than an oxygen mask. But let them clomp around in their\nrubberized long-johns if they wanted to.\n\nIn a few minutes they would be coming in through the igloo's airlock.\nMartin Devere turned away, scowling now. He hoped the Institute hadn't\ndecided to reopen Mars Project. There was plenty of room in all these\nigloos and connecting tunnels that had been left behind, but with a new\nexpedition here it might get pretty crowded. Mainly, Devere didn't want\na bunch of amateurs poking around his diggings, breaking things.\n\nHis thumb rubbed slowly across the long stubble on his chin. He\nwondered if he had made some slip in that last report, or in some of\nthe pictures of the ruins he'd sent back. He'd rather the Institute\ndidn't find out about those fossilized machines he'd dug up. He didn't\nunderstand the gadgets himself, but some of the people at the Institute\njust might decide they were interesting enough to be worth sending up\nan expert.\n\nThe Institute, Devere knew, was interested in machinery, not art\nobjects.\n\n\n\nOne of the men held an automatic pistol pointed at Martin Devere while\nthe other was stripping off his space gear. Then the pistol changed\nhands while the first man removed his own suit. Martin Devere could\nhave told them that he wasn't afraid of the gun. He didn't actually\ncare much, one way or the other: let them point it if it made them\nhappy. Martin Devere figured that he had already lived a lot longer,\nhere in this feeble gravity and germ-free, oxygen-rich air, than his\ntricky heart would have allowed him on Earth. Let them point the gun if\nthey wanted to.\n\n\"If you make one move toward the radio transmitter I'll blow your head\noff,\" the taller man said. He had black wavy hair that hung over his\nbrow. The other man was completely bald.\n\n\"I don't even know if the radio works,\" Martin Devere answered. \"I\nhaven't turned it on in years. I should warn you, though, that if you\nshoot that thing inside the igloo here, it will puncture the plastic\nwall and let all the air out. I always keep the pressure up high\nindoors so I can boil water for coffee.\"\n\nThe tall man frowned in confusion and blinked at the weapon in his\nhand. Then he stared at the transparent dome above him, as if realizing\nfor the first time that only a thin bubble of plastic separated him\nfrom near-vacuum, now that he had removed his suit.\n\n\"I was just making some coffee when you showed up,\" Martin Devere said,\nturning away. \"Have some? I'm afraid it's instant. I've given up trying\nto get the Institute to send me a can of real coffee in the rocket.\nThey think I need canned TV shows more.\"\n\n\"He's harmless,\" the bald man said. \"You can see he's just an old\nsenile nut. Leave him be, we've work to do.\"\n\nThe tall man lowered his weapon, then let it fall into the holster at\nhis hip.\n\n\"No big hurry. I think I'd like some of that coffee first. Say, Pop,\nhow about cooking us a meal in a couple of hours?\"\n\nMartin Devere was spooning brown powder into three cups.\n\n\"Sure thing. What would you like--beans and franks, or franks and\nbeans?\"\n\n\n\n\"I suppose you wonder what we're doing, Pop?\" The tall man held the\ndisassembled pieces of his gun in his lap. He was carefully polishing\neach part with a chemically treated cloth.\n\nIt was three days since they had landed, and the tall metal skeleton\nwas beginning to take shape out in the desert. At the moment, the\nbald man was out alone, testing circuits. Usually the two went out\ntogether--they had apparently decided it was safe to leave Martin\nDevere unguarded, though they had smashed his radio transmitter just in\ncase.\n\nThe two men worked steadily during the daylight hours, came back at\nsunset to eat and sleep, then went out again at dawn. The towering\nlacework of steel was growing like an ugly flower.\n\nThe tall man held the trigger assembly of his gun up to the light.\nHe turned it slowly between his thumb and forefinger. It cast an odd\ncrescent-shaped shadow over the muscles of his jaw.\n\n\"No, I don't wonder what you're doing,\" Martin Devere answered. He was\nsitting at his workbench, crouched over an ancient metal plate as thin\nas paper.\n\nThe tall man began to put his weapon back together again. He snapped\nthe trigger assembly into the receiver. He pulled the hammer back and\nthen released it; it made a sharp, hard click.\n\n\"Not even curious, Pop? Okay, then tell me what _you're_ doing. What's\nthat piece of tinfoil you've been staring at the past two hours?\"\n\nMartin Devere straightened and turned to look at the other.\n\n\"It's an ancient Martian scroll. It's nearly a million years old. I\nfound it in a new pit I've been digging, five hundred meters down. It's\nthe longest and perhaps most important bit of Martian writing I've\nfound so far.\"\n\n\"Yeah? What's it have to say?\"\n\nMartin Devere shook his head. \"Their language, their whole frame of\nreference, was fundamentally different from ours. It's something like\nhigher mathematics, you'd have to learn the language to understand it.\nBut I suppose you might say that this is a poem.... Yes, an epic poem.\"\n\nThe tall man laughed. He shoved an ammunition clip into his weapon,\npumped a round into the chamber, slipped the gun back into its holster.\nHe got up and began pacing the floor of the igloo. The floor was\ncluttered with dozens of artifacts.\n\nHe stopped and nudged one specimen with his toe.\n\n\"What's this thing, Pop? An ancient Martian meatgrinder?\"\n\n\"I hardly think so. They were vegetarians.\" He squinted at the object.\n\"I'm afraid I have no idea what it is. It's some sort of machine, but\nI'm no engineer, I can't imagine what its function was. They--don't\nbuild many machines, you know.\"\n\nThe man with the gun turned to stare at Martin Devere.\n\n\"You mean _didn't_ build, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course.... Past tense.\" And Devere turned again to peer at the\nmillion-year-old poem before him.\n\n\n\n\"Damn it to hell. This might hold us up a week.\" The bald man flung the\nshatterproof helmet of his suit against the igloo wall. His tone of\nvoice was matter-of-fact emotionless. Even the way he threw the helmet\nbetrayed no real emotion. Still wearing the rest of his suit he sat\ndown at Martin Devere's work bench and clenched his fists. His face was\nsmooth, blank.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" His partner put down some drawings and came over.\n\n\"The modulator circuit doesn't check out. I'll have to take the whole\nworks apart and start over again.\" The bald man spoke--when he did\nspeak--with a faint accent that Martin Devere could not identify.\n\n\"It doesn't matter.\" The other rubbed at his chin. \"We're still ahead\nof our schedule.\"\n\n\"Hey. Old man.\" The bald man pointed at Devere. \"You have anything to\ndrink in this cave of yours?\"\n\nMartin Devere frowned, thinking. He remembered a bottle he'd been\nsaving for some special occasion--he couldn't recall what, just now.\n\n\"I think I have some bourbon,\" he said at last. \"If I can find it.\"\n\n\"Find it. Mine straight, on the rocks.\"\n\nWhen Martin Devere returned awhile later, the bald man was still\nwearing his helmetless space suit. He and his friend were studying a\ncomplex wiring diagram spread out on the work bench.\n\nMartin Devere put two plastic cups down on the bench and poured them\nfull. Neither of the men looked up from their diagram until he had set\nthe bottle down.\n\n\"Pour one for yourself, Pop,\" the tall man said.\n\n\"Thanks. Don't mind if I do.\" Devere went to get another cup. Over his\nshoulder he said, \"Hope you boys don't mind crushed ice instead of\ncubes. I just set a bucket of water in one of the unheated tunnels for\na couple minutes. Then I hit it with a hammer.\"\n\nIt was four hours past sunset, the temperature outside was far below\nfreezing.\n\n\"One thing you don't need on Mars is a refrigerator!\" Pouring himself\na drink, the old man suddenly laughed. It was a brief, senile giggle,\nthat made the tall man turn to stare at him.\n\n\"Could be uncomfortable, though, if you were ever stuck out there at\nnight.\" Martin Devere's face was sober once more as he lifted his\ncup and looked deeply into it. All trace of senility had vanished as\nsuddenly as it had appeared. \"Like, say, if you were out there long\nenough for your suit power to go dead. You'd freeze to a hunk of ice\nin a few minutes.... Me, I never go outside at night.\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" the bald man said.\n\n\n\nAll day the bald man had been out alone, working on his electronic\ncircuits. Evidently this left his partner nothing to do except study\nschematics.\n\nNow Martin Devere was aware that his guest had been staring at him for\nseveral minutes without speaking. Martin Devere went on polishing the\ngreen crystal vase he held in his hand. The vase looked ordinary at\nfirst glance, until you noticed that it wasn't quite symmetrical. There\nwas a studied and careful asymmetry about its form, barely discernible,\nthat would disturb you the more you looked at it--until you knew\nsuddenly that no human brain could have created that shape.\n\nThe polishing cloth moved rhythmically across the vase's curving\nsurfaces. The green crystal reflected light in a way that made you\nbegin to think about boundless seas of water.\n\n\"I'll be glad when this job is over with,\" the tall man said, half\naloud.\n\n\"When it is, will you go away?\" Martin Devere turned the vase slowly in\nhis hands.\n\n\"Not for a while yet, Pop.\" The man with the gun on his hip got to his\nfeet and stretched.\n\n\"I don't mind telling you what it's all about, Pop. You're all\nright. It's simple. My partner and I were sent here by a certain\nnational power that doesn't like being told how to run its own\naffairs by the United Governments. We're striking the first blow for\nFreedom. That thing we're putting together out there is a bomb. It\ncould--disable--most of Earth. It has a new kind of nuclear rocket\nengine behind it that could carry it across 200 million miles in a few\nhours.\n\n\"You get the idea, Pop? Here on Mars, they won't even find it. And if\nthey did, we could deliver the bomb before they got a missile halfway\nacross.... So I hope you won't mind if my partner and I stay a while,\nPop.\"\n\nIt was several seconds before Martin Devere answered. He set the\ncrystal vase carefully inside a case and regarded it a moment.\n\n\"As long as you don't go messing up my diggings or break any of the\nartifacts, it's no business of mine.\"\n\n\"And what if I did, Pop?\" The tall man walked closer to Martin Devere.\nHe stood over the old man, his shadow on him. His hand rested lightly\non the butt of his gun. \"What if I were to take all your vases and\nstatues and pots and tablets and smash them to bits, one by one? What\nwould you do then?\"\n\nMartin Devere's eyes slowly closed and opened, he made no other move\nfor a minute. Then he got to his feet without looking at the other man.\nHe turned and began to move away, toward a tunnel door that led to the\ndiggings.\n\nProbably the tall man thought that he had finally put the fear of God\ninto Martin Devere. But as he turned back to his pile of schematics he\nheard the old man's whisper:\n\n\"You might regret it.\"\n\nThe man with the gun did not answer.\n\n\n\n\"Tell us about it, Pop.\"\n\n\"Yes, why don't you tell us about it.\"\n\nThey meant Martin Devere's work. The two men had finished their own\njob. The assembled bomb rested in the desert, silent but alive, like\nsome abnormal growth.\n\nBecause of sunspot activity they hadn't yet been able to radio their\nemployers on Earth. The bald man expected conditions to clear in two\nor three days. When they did clear, he would signal, \"The bird is\nnesting.\" Then the nation he had mentioned would be ready to deliver\nits ultimatum to the United Governments.\n\nFor the first time since landing on Mars, the two men were idle. They\nwere waiting. They looked as if they were willing to wait a long time\nif necessary.\n\nMeanwhile, Martin Devere's artifacts were the only amusements available.\n\nPerhaps the old man knew they were making fun of him. But he seemed\nto take their question seriously. When he began to speak, they found\nthemselves listening.\n\n\"We don't know exactly what happened.\" Martin Devere faced the two\nmen across the cluttered workbench like a lecturer addressing his\nstudents. He held in his hand a small bronze statue that might have\nbeen a portrayal of one of the old Martian people or, just as likely,\nsome long-extinct animal. In the diffuse sunlight that came through\nthe igloo wall, it cast a shadow on the work bench that was even more\ndisturbingly alien in shape.\n\n\"No, we don't know what happened to them,\" the old man said. \"The last\nof them died nearly a million years ago, before the first Homo Sapiens\nwalked the Earth. From what we--I--have found we know a little about\nwhat they were like. But we don't know why they died.\n\n\"We do know, for instance, that they never had much interest in\ntechnology. Not that they lacked intelligence. They could build a\nmachine when it suited their purposes, whatever those may have been.\nAnd I don't say they weren't interested in science. They had a highly\ndeveloped theoretical science, as sophisticated as their art. You might\nsay they were theoreticians. They were concerned with pure art and pure\nscience--but not with applied technology, or commercialized art.\n\n\"My own theory is that they had no need for technology. In the first\nplace, they were vegetarians, not carnivorous. So that their earliest\nmen had no need for hunting weapons--or other gadgets. Probably they\nnever developed the aggressive instincts which in humanity led to\nwarfare with its subsequent impetus to applied technology. The Martians\nnever got around to making cars or airplanes or bombs. They dedicated\nthemselves, gentlemen, to the contemplation of beauty.\n\n\"Then, nearly a million years ago, something happened to them. Perhaps\nMars began to lose her atmosphere then. Her oceans evaporated, the\nair could no longer retain her heat at night, the farmlands parched\nand froze. A few of the plant types were able to adapt and survive.\nBut within a few years, all animal life died out. One day, there were\nsuddenly no more Martians left.\"\n\nMartin Devere's dry, withered hand caressed the small statue he held.\n\n\"Who knows? If they'd had time to develop space travel they might have\nsaved themselves. Then again, with a technology like yours, they might\nhave blown themselves up long before the natural catastrophe ...\"\n\n\"What do you mean like _yours_?\" the tall man said. \"You mean like\n_ours_, don't you?\"\n\nBut Martin Devere turned away without answering.\n\n\n\n\"Do you have another bottle of bourbon, old man?\"\n\n\"No, I'm afraid not,\" Devere said. \"There was only that one bottle.\"\n\n\"Too bad. We should have a little celebration.\" The bald man began\nsealing himself into his spacesuit.\n\n\"I'll wait for you here,\" his partner said. \"I'd better start burning\nthose plans.\"\n\nMartin Devere looked up from the fragment of ceramic he was cleaning.\n\n\"You're going to send the message now?\"\n\nNeither of the men bothered to reply, since the answer was\nself-evident. The bald man tested the air and power equipment of his\nsuit, then turned to his partner a moment before sealing his helmet.\n\n\"You checked the sandcat's power supply?\"\n\n\"Yes, but you'd better take another look at it. I think the battery's\nleaking.\"\n\nThe bald man nodded and went out the airlock. Martin Devere watched in\nsilence as the other man began to gather up his diagrams and plans and\ntie them into a neat bundle.\n\n\"I guess we can take it easy now, Pop. As soon as that telegram's sent\nand I get this stuff burned, my partner and I are unemployed. Of course\nwe'll have to hang around a while longer in case they want us to shoot\noff Baby out there, but there's nothing to that. In the meantime maybe\nI can help you dig up some more of those old pots and statues.\"\n\nMartin Devere seemed to be thinking. He watched as the tall man checked\nto make sure he hadn't forgotten anything, then carried the bundle of\nplans over to the electronic oven.\n\n\"_Baby._ You mean your bomb, out there. You think you might actually\nshoot it off then.\"\n\n\"Oh, maybe, maybe not.\"\n\n\"Couldn't they fire it from Earth by radio?\" Devere asked.\n\n\"Nope. Somebody might try jamming.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see....\"\n\nMartin Devere was silent again until the tall man opened the oven and\nremoved a bundle of gray ash. He dumped the ashes into a bucket and\nbegan stirring them with his hand.\n\n\"Something else I was wondering about,\" Devere said. He began cleaning\nthe fragment of ceramic again, his hands working in a slow circular\nmotion.\n\n\"Supposing the United Governments find out where it--the bomb is. They\nmight send a missile to blow it up.\"\n\n\"Told you, Pop. Baby can out-run anything else that flies. Wouldn't do\nthem any good.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.... Still, the missile would hit Mars, wouldn't it? I mean,\nit would destroy all this--the igloos, my diggings ...\"\n\nThe tall man gave a laugh.\n\n\"Don't worry so much, Pop. We'd have plenty of time to get in the ship\nand clear out. We might even take you with us.\"\n\n\"Still ...\" But the old man lapsed again into thought.\n\n\n\nAn hour later, the short-range radio gave a shrill beep. The tall man\nwent over and flipped the _talk_ switch.\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Hello. Listen, I did something stupid.\"\n\nMartin Devere looked up at the sound of the bald man's voice. Devere's\nhands still held the piece of ceramic. He had polished it until a\ncomplex geometric design was visible, etched in reds and blues. It\nmight have been equally a decoration or some mechanical diagram.\n\n\"Did you get the message sent?\" the tall man asked.\n\n\"Yes, that part's all right. I got to the ship and contacted\nheadquarters. I think they're going to deliver the ultimatum right\naway. Now we just wait for orders. The only thing is, the sandcat's\npower went dead on me while I was halfway down a hill. It started to\nroll, and I forgot I was wearing a spacesuit. I jumped out. This low\ngravity fooled me too. I think I've broken my ankle, it hurts like\nhell.\"\n\nThe tall man cursed in a low voice.\n\n\"All right, all right,\" he said after a moment. \"Just take it easy.\nI'll have to come out and get you.\"\n\n\"I think the sandcat is all right. Stupid of me to jump like that,\nwasn't thinking. Better bring a spare battery with you.... Oh, and\nyou'd better bring a light too. It will be getting dark in another half\nhour.\"\n\n\"Okay, just wait for me. I'll home in on your suit radio.\"\n\nThe tall man switched off the receiver and went to his own suit locker.\nMartin Devere watched as he removed the holster and weapon from his\nhip. He pulled the heavy plastic trousers over his denim jumper and\nthen buckled the gun back again before starting on the rest of the\nspacesuit.\n\n\"Nothing serious, I hope?\" Martin Devere put the ceramic down carefully\nand picked up another object from a stack of artifacts.\n\n\"You heard, didn't you? You any good at setting a broken ankle, Pop?\"\n\n\"Oh, I could manage, I guess. Broke my arm down in the diggings once.\nHad to set it myself. Twenty years ago, I think it was. I've been more\ncareful since then.\" He gave a laugh. It started as a normal laugh,\nthen broke to a senile giggle. Then his face was serious again. He\ncarried the new artifact closer to the man with the gun.\n\n\"You know, I was telling you.... The Martians were vegetarians. They\nnever made any weapons for hunting. They did know about explosives,\nthough.\"\n\n\"What's that thing?\" The tall man, struggling with the buckles of his\nbreathing equipment, glanced at the object in Devere's hands. It looked\nlike badly corroded bronze, and consisted of a long tube with a large\nbulb at one end.\n\n\"This? Oh, this is some kind of a tool I found. I think it was a\ndigging tool, used for breaking up rocks. They _did_ build canals, you\nknow.... As I was saying, they knew about explosives. This tool, for\ninstance. It worked by means of a small, shaped charge inside this\nbulb here. The explosion was so well-focused that there was almost no\nrecoil. A high-energy shock wave was emitted from the barrel--very\neffective at short range. But the most amazing thing about this tool is\nthat the chemical explosive is still potent after lying underground for\nnearly a million years....\n\n\"Oh, by the way. There's nothing wrong with your sandcat's battery. It\nwas the motor I sabotaged.\"\n\nThen Martin Devere pointed the ancient digging tool at the tall man and\nblew him into two neat pieces.\n\n\n\nThe Hermit of Mars never did get around to walking out to the space\nship and using his visitor's radio to tell Earth what had happened. He\nreally intended to, but he forgot. The ultimatum that was delivered to\nthe United Governments failed, of course, but no one knew exactly why\nuntil the next Earth-Mars conjunction.\n\nThe United Governments was prevailed on by the World Television Service\nto send out someone to interview the Hermit, if he were still alive.\n\nThat interview was unfortunate. It might have established Martin Devere\nas the world hero that he was, and he might have been awarded some kind\nof medal. As it went, his rude and insulting answers to the young man's\nquestions made him unpopular for years.\n\nHis last answer in the interview was the worst. The young man, already\nsweating, looked in desperation at the green crystal vase that Martin\nDevere insisted on holding in front of the television lens. (Back at\nthe Institute, a dozen faces were flushing red with indignation as\ntheir owners realized what the old man had been holding back.)\n\n\"Tell me, Dr. Devere,\" the young man asked. \"You seem--er--a very\nmodest man. Doesn't it make you the least bit proud to know that you've\nsaved the world?\"\n\nMartin Devere lowered his vase and gave the young man a puzzled look.\n\n\"You mean Earth? Tell me, why should I want to save _that_ world?\"\n\n\nEND",
