    "body": "Dictators are the most naive persons. About all they know are the facts\nof life. Therefore Great America's Dodson thoroughly approved of a man\nsuch as Joel Barlow and a girl such as Laurine Coret walking in the\npark at twilight. Quite evidently Director Dodson reasoned: Dusk is\nmysterious.... Man is curious.... Q. E. D.--usually.\n\nA civic guard saw them and saluted with a good-natured grin. Wisely,\nthey returned the salute. Then Laurine passed her arm under Barlow's\nand sort of cuddled up to him. He straightened and looked at her with\nsurprise.\n\n\"Smile, darn you,\" she grated. \"Make it look real--as though you\nenjoyed it, even if you don't.\"\n\nHis lips stretched into a grimace that in the dusk, passed muster for\na smile. And the civic guard smiled fondly after them as they walked\nalong the park path.\n\n\"What does Central want me for?\" Barlow asked when the guard was beyond\nearshot.\n\n\"The organization is going to hibernate. You're to pass the word along.\n'Stay away from headquarters.'\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Dodson must have managed to get agents into our organization. The New\nOrleans headquarters was raided during a meeting.\"\n\n\"Did they get them all?\" he asked quickly.\n\nShe nodded. He said nothing, but his hands closed slowly. They both\nknew the seriousness of the loss, but still her eyes clung to his face.\nDirector Dodson knew the facts of life.\n\nSuddenly her gaze went over his shoulder and her eyes widened with\nfright. She turned with a stifled scream and fled. Barlow stared after\nher with puzzled eyes.\n\n\"--me she didn't like,\" said a rueful voice behind him. \"I beg your\npardon. I guess it's--\"\n\nBarlow turned quickly, but saw nothing. Then, as though someone had\nswitched on a light, there was a violet haze in front of him. And in\nthe middle of the haze was the figure of a man. Then the man and the\nqueer haze disappeared as though the light had been turned off.\n\nA moment later it had returned. \"--leave you so abruptly,\" the figure\nsaid, and vanished. A second later it reappeared and said, \"I'm sorry I\nhad to--\"\n\nBarlow moved away, intending to follow Laurine.\n\n\"Don't go,\" said the queer newcomer. \"I think I've settled down, and I\nwant to talk to you.\"\n\nThe haze flickered uncertainly. Barlow's last doubt was removed. He\nmust know how Laurine was faring. But before he could get started, the\nviolet haze and the talking image had returned.\n\n\"Hello,\" it greeted cheerfully. \"I'm glad you waited. I've made it at\nlast. Inconvenient--that time-lash.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Barlow agreed uncertainly. He stared at the newcomer. The fellow\nappeared to be an ordinary human being. The violet haze had vanished\nand in the poor light Barlow couldn't see him very clearly, but it\nseemed that he was rather tall, strongly built, not too good-looking,\nand dressed in loose, comfortably fitting clothes. At the moment the\nnewcomer was staring in the direction Laurine had fled.\n\n\"Too bad I frightened her,\" he said with a shake of his head. \"She's a\ncute little trick.\"\n\nBarlow frowned at the familiarity. \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Valnar one-oh-oh-three-oh-seven-one-oh-oh--\"\n\n\"I didn't ask for your telephone number,\" snapped Barlow. \"What's your\nname?\"\n\n\"That's it,\" said the newcomer. \"You see, I'm from--well, from the\nfuture. I was experimenting with time, and discovered a few of the\nnatural laws that I could control. I constructed this traveler\"--He\ntapped a plaque strapped to his chest. \"--and since then I've just been\nwandering around ... trying to get back home.\"\n\n\"Lost?\" asked Barlow more friendly.\n\nValnar hesitated. \"Well, not exactly. I'm always able to find out where\nI am, but I can't find my own time. Right now, for instance, figuring\nfrom the Birth of Christ as many of the people I've met do, I should be\nin the year 1974. Is that right?\"\n\n\"Nineteen seventy-three,\" Barlow corrected.\n\nThe man named Valnar seemed shocked. \"Another error,\" he murmured. \"If\nI don't do better than that, I'm going to find myself out in space,\nfreezing to death.\"\n\n\"I thought you said you were time-traveling,\" Barlow questioned.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Valnar. \"But traveling in time requires considerable\nknowledge of astronomy. Both the Earth and the Sun move in space. If\nI were to travel twenty-four hours into the future, without moving in\nspace, I'd find myself out in the void. But luckily the earth seems to\nexert an attraction which compensates for numerous errors, though it\nupsets my calculations concerning the time.\"\n\n\"What time are you from?\"\n\n\"1974.\"\n\n\"That's next year! That means there are two of you in the world\nnow--that is impossible!\"\n\n\"No,\" Valnar disagreed impatiently. \"I told you this wasn't my\ntime--maybe I should say, space-time continuum. Time is like a tree\nwith a lot of branches--too damn many of them. In my own time, we\ncalculate that dimension from the Year of the Subsidence. I slid down\nmy branch of that space-time continuum, and now I can't find it again.\nMy people are the descendants of an Atlantean colony established in\nwhat you call Florida, but evidently that colony had few chances for\nsurvival--perhaps only one. That would make it a single small branch\nand difficult to find--which it is,\" he concluded feelingly.\n\n\"Then how do you explain your being able to speak English?\" Barlow\nasked, grinning. He was thinking that the stranger was an unconvincing\nliar.\n\n\"This stop is merely incidental. I miscalculated time before last and\nlanded in 1941--met a nice fellow who didn't ask too many questions.\"\nHe looked severely at Barlow. \"_He_ believed me right away, taught me\nEnglish, and told me I was just like someone out of a science-fiction\nstory. Poor fellow was quite worried about some sort of a European\nmenace, though. So I gave him the Mental Ray to protect his--\"\n\n\"Why, you dirty--\" Barlow started forward with swinging fists. He\nlanded one fairly solid blow, then his hands were held powerless in the\nother's.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" Valnar asked a bit angrily.\n\nBarlow fought to free himself, and couldn't. Valnar was much stronger\nthan he appeared to be. Finally he ceased his struggling, watching\nclosely for a chance, but he didn't stop cursing the newcomer.\n\n\"Was that fellow's name Dodson?\" he asked at last.\n\n\"Why yes,\" Valnar admitted with surprise. \"Then my help was enough to\nprotect this continent. Good!\"\n\n\"Yeah, 'Good!'\" Barlow snarled. \"Your 'poor' Dodson protected the\nAmerican continents, but when he saw that it was so easy, he decided\nto be a Dictator--only he calls himself, Director.\" Suddenly Barlow\nchuckled, \"Now Europe is squealing about the 'American Menace.' Don't\nyou think you ought to go over and 'protect' them?\"\n\n\n\nValnar released Barlow and stepped back. \"But he didn't seem like that\nsort of a fellow. He was so--so idealistic!\"\n\n\"Probably because he didn't have anything to be practical about,\"\nBarlow sneered. \"Now he's got the Mental Ray you said you gave him,\nand he controls two continents with absolute power--and is thinking of\nexpanding. The only ones in all the Americas who can even _think_ he's\nwrong are a few like me--ones who for some reason, aren't affected by\nthe ray which orders your thoughts to an approved pattern.\"\n\n\"The dirty heel!\" Valnar spat. \"I'm going back and kill him. So long!\"\n\n\"Wait! What good will that do? He's here now, so that proves you didn't\nkill him. But you caused all this mess; help us free ourselves.\"\n\n\"I can kill him; and I will. I'll create a new branch of the tree--a\nworld where Dodson died right after protecting the Americas.\"\n\n\"But what about this branch!\" Barlow shouted as Valnar's hand went to\nthe plaque on his chest. \"According to your screwy theory this limb\nwill still be going strong.\"\n\nValnar hesitated. \"You're right,\" he admitted, lowering his hand. \"We\nmight as well create two new limbs, one right here.\"\n\nBarlow waited, watching Valnar. Somehow he was impressed by the other.\nHe no longer considered him merely a liar; there _was_ something\nstrange about the newcomer. And the circumstances surrounding the\ndiscovery of the Mental Ray had never been explained. Dodson was no\nscientist, and yet he and no other knew the more complicated parts of\nthe powerful electrical broadcaster that matched the thought waves of\nthe people and heterodyned those he considered undesirable.\n\n\"I'll have to acquaint myself with the circumstances,\" said Valnar.\n\n\"Okay, what do you want to know?\" Barlow offered.\n\nValnar looked at him slyly. \"It would be much more pleasant to learn\nfrom that girl you were with. I always try to make my work pleasant.\"\n\nBarlow made a wry face. \"_I'll_ help you,\" he repeated, and wondered\nwhy he so instantly rejected Valnar's suggestion.\n\nValnar shrugged. \"Oh, all right. If you insist. But she sure lit out of\nhere in a hurry. Where was she headed?\"\n\n\"She knew I could run faster than she could, and wanted a headstart,\"\nBarlow grinned. \"She's probably at headquarters now, getting a bunch to\nhelp me.\"\n\n\"Let's go to headquarters,\" said Valnar.\n\nBarlow looked at him sharply, frowning with suspicion. \"You promised\nto help,\" he reminded.\n\n\"Oh, you may be sure that I shall,\" Valnar assured airily. \"Lead on,\nMacBarlow!\"\n\nBarlow grunted and started toward the headquarters that he was never\nsupposed to approach. The organization believed in never establishing\na personal trail between the various headquarters, and Barlow was a\nrunner. But he considered that the circumstances warranted disobedience.\n\n\"Your education was evidently quite sketchy,\" he grumbled as he led the\nway. \"Dodson didn't give you your money's worth.\"\n\n\n\nTwo blocks from headquarters, Barlow halted suddenly. He was staring at\ntwo patrol wagons drawn up in front of the suspiciously unimpressive\nbuilding that the organization used.\n\n\"It's a raid!\" he snapped to Valnar.\n\nTwo guards came out of the building with a young girl between them.\nThey helped her into the nearest car, even though she fought against it.\n\n\"They've got Laurine,\" Barlow cried, starting forward.\n\nValnar caught his arm and held him back. \"Is that her name?\" he asked\neasily.\n\nBarlow fought to free his arm from Valnar's grasp, but the newcomer was\nmuch too strong.\n\n\"Come, don't be childish,\" Valnar reprimanded. \"There are too many\nof them. Don't worry about your friends. We'll free them as soon as\npossible.\"\n\nBarlow was undetermined.\n\n\"In the meantime, we'll go to see Dodson,\" Valnar continued.\n\nThat settled Barlow's mind. To get near the Director was something that\nevery member of the organization hoped to do. Besides, Laurine and\nthe others would be safe for a while. The \"questioning\" of the guards\nalways started on a gentle note.\n\n\"How will we get to him?\" he asked.\n\n\"That's up to you,\" said Valnar. \"You get some sort of a conveyance,\nand I'll construct a small Mental Ray to blackout anyone who tries to\nstop us.\"\n\nBarlow took Valnar to the rooms he had engaged and managed to secure\nthe apparatus Valnar declared essential. Luckily it could be made from\naltered radio parts, the sale of which wasn't restricted. But his own\npart of the task was harder.\n\nDodson was one of the first to realize the power of transportation,\nand held firm control of all its phases. Public conveyances wouldn't\nserve their purpose because, while Barlow's passports were necessarily\nin order even though forged, Valnar had none. And no forger was\navailable.\n\nThey must steal either an auto or a plane--preferably, a plane. But\nthere was no such thing as a private auto or plane, and the civic\nconveyances were carefully controlled.\n\nFinally Barlow had to admit defeat and return to his rooms. He went in\nwearily and sat down. Valnar greeted him cheerfully.\n\n\"It's finished,\" he said, waving to the small assembly on the table.\n\nBarlow peered at it. \"I failed,\" he admitted. \"Couldn't steal one\nanywhere.\"\n\n\"Then we'll get one with this,\" said Valnar.\n\nBarlow thought of his wearying hours of search and felt like slugging\nthe other. But he knew that Valnar would win any scrimmage, so he\nregretfully discarded the idea.\n\n\"Then we might as well free Laurine and the others before we take off,\"\nhe suggested.\n\nValnar's eyes glowed with interest. \"Good idea!\" he approved. \"I was\nthinking that we'd need help.\"\n\nThe city prison was a grim structure. It contained few people, but\nthose it did swallow were seldom heard of again. Barlow felt a\ntightening of his muscles as they approached.\n\nValnar was carrying the ray projector. He walked along confidently,\nwith an unserious buoyancy like that of a person engaged in a game with\nchildren. Barlow envied him.\n\nHe was well aware of what they were fighting. And the thought that\npossibly the projector wouldn't work, made him feel hollow. The guards\nat the entrance stepped forward to bar the way.\n\nValnar's fingers switched on the projector and he swept it over the two\nguards. They dropped their rifles and slumped to the stone entranceway.\nBarlow picked up their rifles, then stared at them. They were sleeping\npeacefully.\n\nValnar strode into the building, applied the ray to another man, and\nentered the warden's office. The warden leaped to his feet angrily.\n\n\"We want the prisoners brought in yesterday,\" Valnar informed.\n\n\"Shoot, Perkins!\" cried the warden.\n\n\n\nBarlow wheeled, rifle ready. A secretary that they hadn't noticed at\nthe other end of the room was leveling a pistol. Barlow moved the rifle\nswiftly, but Valnar was the swifter and the secretary lay back in his\nchair and went to sleep.\n\n\"The prisoners, please,\" Valnar insisted.\n\n\"I--I can't,\" said the warden, sitting down weakly.\n\n\"You better,\" Barlow advised.\n\n\"They were taken to Washington this morning at the orders of the\nDirector.\"\n\nValnar switched on his projector again and the warden fell forward on\nhis desk, snoring. Barlow urged Valnar toward the elevator that would\ntake them to the roof.\n\n\"A police plane will do fine,\" he said. \"And they are fast. We've got\nto get to Washington in a hurry.\"\n\n\"Is that where Dodson is?\" Valnar asked as they shot upward while the\nelevator operator snored peacefully in a corner.\n\n\"Yes, and God only knows what he intends to do to Laurine and the\nothers.\"\n\nThe elevator halted at the roof and Barlow faced Valnar. \"Can you\nspread that beam to get everybody up here?\" he asked. \"Then they won't\nfollow, or radio ahead to have us intercepted.\"\n\n\"Sure thing,\" Valnar said, motioning for Barlow to open the door.\n\nBarlow pulled the sliding door aside, and Valnar stepped outside with\nthe projector running. He swept the roof quickly and smiled with\nsatisfaction to see the uniformed men fall.\n\nBarlow chose the newest of the planes ready on the roof and helped\nValnar inside the cabin. Then he climbed inside himself and found\nValnar staring at the controls with offended eyes. He turned to Barlow.\n\n\"Can you fly this thing?\"\n\n\"I was in the Air Guards before they discovered that I was an\nUnamenable,\" Barlow answered with a smile. He started the motor, waited\nuntil the nearly silent hum of power had reached a constant pitch, then\nsent the plane into the air.\n\n\"Why do you have so many instruments?\" Valnar demanded. \"Doesn't Dodson\nknow that the acme of science is simplicity--beautiful simplicity?\nThis plane has ten times as many instruments as my time-traveler. It's\nfoolish and confusing.\"\n\n\"I didn't make it,\" Barlow disclaimed. \"But then you got to remember\nthat you've been making errors in your calculations. Maybe you need a\nfew more instruments.\"\n\nValnar said nothing. For several minutes he was silent, then when\nhe did speak, the subject was entirely different. \"What did you\nmean--'Unamenable'?\"\n\n\"That's Dodson's name for those who aren't affected by the Mental Ray.\nI guess you're one, or you wouldn't be helping me.\"\n\nValnar shook his head. \"Never heard of it,\" he declared. \"The ray\naffects me all right, but I only gave Dodson a low-power version of\nthis,\" he signified the set he had constructed, \"and I am able to\ncompensate for the effect.\"\n\n\n\nIt was late evening when they sighted the lights of Washington. Barlow\nsent the plane down over an arterial highway that stretched in the\nnight like a glowing worm. He hovered noiselessly above it until he was\nsure that there were no cars in sight, then landed.\n\n\"Why don't we go on?\" Valnar asked.\n\n\"Dodson has forbidden planes to fly over Washington, and there are\nanti-aircraft batteries permanently on duty to enforce the order.\"\n\nValnar grumbled, but helped Barlow send the plane into a field near\nthe road, where it would not immediately be seen. They walked into the\nlittle suburban town. It took only a short time to find an automobile,\nbut when they started away in it, the owner came running out of a\ntavern, shrieking for the police. Valnar lifted the projector and\nremoved the man's objections and they sped on toward the White House.\n\nThe closer they came to the symbol of government, the more doubtful\nBarlow became. It had all been too easy. Through years he had been\nconditioned to a powerful, almost omnipotent government that struck\nback savagely at the least resistance. And now he was nearing\nthe nervous center of that government in an automobile! Like any\ngovernment-approved and personally curious tourist. It almost made him\nfeel guilty.\n\nThe guards at the entrance of the drive halted them. Valnar lifted the\nprojector confidently and the men slumped to the pavement. Barlow got\nout and dragged them aside and opened the gates, then sent the car up\nthe drive.\n\nHe halted at the entrance at Valnar's direction. Valnar climbed out of\nthe car with Olympian confidence as a pair of guards barred the way and\nan officer stepped forward to question them.\n\n\"Your names, gentlemen?\"\n\nBarlow followed Valnar out of the car and watched Valnar thumb the\nswitch of the projector. The beam swept over the three soldiers. And\nnothing happened. Valnar passed the beam over them again and still\nnothing resulted. The two at the doorway still barred the way and the\nofficer smiled grimly.\n\n\"Your names are unnecessary,\" he said. \"We have been waiting for you.\"\nHe waved to someone in the darkness.\n\nBarlow turned and saw a full squad with leveled rifles. There was no\nchance to get the two rifles he had brought with them. There was no\nchance for any sort of a fight. They were trapped as completely as rats\nin a wire cage.\n\nValnar seemed paralyzed. He didn't seem to realize that he had been\nvulnerable. He made no resistance when the officer took the projector\nfrom his hands. He stared at Barlow dazedly.\n\n\"The Director will see you,\" the officer said to Valnar, then turned to\nlook at Barlow. \"You must be Barlow,\" he mused. \"Put him with the rest.\nThe Organization will be liquidated tomorrow.\"\n\n\n\nBarlow was escorted to prison by two watchful soldiers. He was silent.\nThe abrupt failure had stunned him, and he knew that it was no use\nto appeal to his guards. With them Dodson was not a ruler; he was a\nmessiah. The Mental Ray effected that in the common man. They might be\npretty decent fellows with wives and families and friends, but on that\none point they were adamant and inviolable.\n\nHe was quickly booked, then taken down the corridor between the cells.\nHe was thrust into the largest cell, the tank, and heard the door close\nbehind him with dreadful finality.\n\n\"Barlow!\" came a surprised shout from one of the men in the crowded\ncell.\n\nBarlow focused his eyes on the face of the man who came forward, and\nsaw that it was the chief of Laurine's group. Then there was a flurry\nof movement among the captives and a girl ran to his arms. Her face was\ntear-streaked and her voice unsteady.\n\n\"Joel! I hoped that they wouldn't get you.\" She was crying again,\nsoftly, face hidden against his chest.\n\nHe stroked her hair slowly. \"Don't cry, Laurine,\" he said dully as he\nlooked around. There were many whom he didn't recognize, but among the\nhalf hundred in the cell he recognized all those of Laurine's group\nthat he had met. He looked at the leader questioningly.\n\n\"A clean sweep,\" said the leader. \"And not only of our group, but of\nevery one in the country. The prisons are full, overcrowded. We know\nthat nearly every man of our group was captured, and the others report\nthe same for their groups. The Organization is through.\"\n\n\"They must have got lists of members,\" Barlow mumbled.\n\n\"How could they?\" the leader demanded. \"Nothing like that exists. We\nnever kept any records. No! It was spies. They may even have got into\nthe organization. Laurine tells me of something strange that made her\nreturn to headquarters to get help for you. What was it?\"\n\nLaurine had ceased her weeping, but she still clung to him. And Barlow\nfelt an inner happiness for her closeness. He held her in his arms\nwhile he told the leader all that had happened to him. When he was\nthrough he expected them to feel as he did, that the disaster had\nstruck them at the very moment when success seemed within their grasp.\nBut instead they were staring at him pityingly.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" he asked hesitantly.\n\nLaurine lifted her head from his chest and freed herself of his arms.\nIn her eyes too, there was pity. But there was also anger.\n\n\"You fool!\" she cried. \"That must have been the spy.\"\n\nBarlow was stricken dumb for a minute. Then he shook his doubts from\nhis mind. \"No! Valnar wanted to help us.\"\n\nThe leader pressed his shoulder with a smile, \"No, son,\" he said,\nshaking his head slowly. \"He must have been a spy. That story\nof time-traveling--\" He left the sentence uncompleted and the\nincompleteness only showed more starkly the absurdity of Valnar's tale.\n\nBarlow felt the strength flow from his body. He felt old, tired. All\nthat they had fought for was gone. This was the world's last chance\nat freedom. All the Unamenables were gathered together for death and\nthere would be no more differences of opinion. The only opinions in the\nAmericas would be those of Director Dodson. And soon his will would be\nthe only power in the world. In his mind's eye he seemed to see man\nmarching through time in a long hopeless column, never progressing,\nalways regressing, without the yeast of the fighting minority. He\nturned away from those eyes of his companions, those eyes that told him\nthat he had had the chance to avenge this betrayal and had failed.\n\nLaurine's hand went to his shoulder and rested there lightly to comfort\nhim. He covered her small hand with his own large one. Then she was\nstanding beside him. His arm was over her shoulders and she was smiling\nup at him.\n\n\"Any one of us would have done the same, Joel,\" she said softly.\n\nHe smiled bitterly. \"If so, we don't deserve to win. We're too damn\ndumb!\"\n\nShe said nothing, but remained quietly at his side. And he became aware\nnow that he was to lose his life, that it could have been much sweeter\nif he hadn't been so blind. He cursed Valnar under his breath.\n\nBut Laurine heard him. \"All you missed was a chance to avenge us,\" she\nsaid. \"The Organization was already doomed.\"\n\nThe anger and disgust left him and he waited with a quiet acceptance.\nThere seemed to be no hope. But he was determined to wait, and watch.\n\n\n\nThe morning was a gray, dull-humored thing. There was no cheer in the\nlarge cell. They waited silently.\n\nIt was still early when guards came into the prison. They marched down\nthe corridor in perfect discipline. Their weapons were well kept and\nready.\n\n\"Empty the tank, first,\" commanded the officer.\n\nThe door of the large cell opened, but there was no chance to fight\nor escape. The prisoners filed out, formed ranks, then, surrounded by\nguards, marched to the prison courtyard.\n\nBarlow and Laurine had managed to stay together and as they left the\nprison, her hand slipped into his. He thought it possible that she was\nafraid. But when he looked at her, her shoulders were back and her eyes\nbright. He pressed her hand.\n\n\"Look, Joel,\" she directed in a whisper when they halted in the\ncourtyard. She nodded her head toward a richly dressed group near the\nouter entrance.\n\nJoel Barlow looked and saw the well-publicized features of Director\nDodson in the middle of the group. And close by the Director was\nValnar.\n\nBut Valnar was heavily guarded. His clothes were torn and the plaque\nwhich he had always worn, was gone. And he had lost his confident\nbearing.\n\nTheir eyes met across the courtyard. Barlow saw Valnar smile, lift\nhis hand in greeting, but he showed no acknowledgement. Valnar's face\nshowed puzzlement.\n\nThe prisoners were lined against the wall. The guards withdrew to one\nside and stood at attention. Director Dodson motioned negligently with\none hand, and Valnar and his guard crossed to the prisoners. Valnar was\nplaced with the prisoners and the guard withdrew.\n\nBarlow stared at Valnar. Then he looked down to meet Laurine's eyes.\n\n\"They're going to kill him too,\" he said. \"He wasn't a spy.\"\n\nShe didn't answer.\n\nBarlow turned again to Valnar, called to him, \"I see you're still with\nus.\"\n\n\"To the end--maybe it won't be so bitter,\" Valnar grinned. \"Get in\nthere and fight when the time comes.\"\n\nBarlow had no chance to ask for an explanation. One of the officers\nwith Dodson stepped forward. He carried the projector Valnar had\nconstructed, but it was changed and was mounted on a tripod. The\nofficer trained it on the prisoners and pressed the switch.\n\nBarlow felt a nervous shock that was almost electrical. He stiffened\nspasmodically. He suddenly felt a hundred times stronger than he had\nbeen, and felt a stinging contempt for the sheep around him. Rage\nwelled into his mind like a hot acid burning away all but the desire to\nfight and kill.\n\nAs through a red haze he saw Valnar collapse limply to the ground. But\nthe other prisoners were standing rigidly, faces twisted with hate. He\nleaped forward.\n\n\"Come on, you yellow-bellied cowards! What the hell does it matter if\nthey have all the guns? Maybe we can get a couple of them anyway!\"\n\nA hoarse roar of approval came from the throats of those behind him.\nLaurine was at his side and they were running toward the group of\nrulers. And behind came the others of the Organization, a blood-hungry,\nhateful rabble. Unfearful of death and desiring only to tear the flesh\nof the Director's men from their bodies.\n\nThen a volley from the massed guards struck into them. Barlow felt\nsomething strike him on the side. He staggered and almost fell as a\nburning thread of agony lanced through his body. But the rage upheld\nhim, made him fight on.\n\nOthers passed him. Laurine ran ahead. He fell to the ground, then\nfought his way to his hands and knees and crawled toward Dodson and his\nsubordinates. He saw Laurine leap at the men at the projector. They\nwent to the ground, fighting and kicking in utter disregard of all\nrules.\n\nThe bullets of the guards were dropping men and women all around him.\nMany struggled up to fight their way onward, but many stayed down.\n\nBarlow reached the projector, grasped the tripod to lift himself up. He\nsaw dimly that Dodson and his officers were clamoring at the gate to\nbe freed from the bloody courtyard, but the portals had been closed to\nretain the prisoners and now did as well for the Director.\n\nWeakly, Barlow turned the projector around. He had to lean over it to\nstay up, but he threw its beam over those at the gate. They went down\nlike dead men, slow and easily. Then the guards, then....\n\nThe rage was leaving him. Blackness was closing in around his mind. He\nsagged over the projector, and dragged it to the ground with him.\n\n\n\nThe blackness around his mind first parted to allow a tiny pricking of\npain to dart into his mind. Then, as though the neural dams had broken,\nagony came. He twisted to escape it, and from far away a voice spoke\nsoothingly.\n\nThe agony faded slowly and he became conscious of light. He saw a\nwhite-garbed figure near him. The face was pretty and feminine, and in\nthe woman's hand was a hypodermic syringe. His mind cleared slowly and\nhe saw more clearly. He was in a hospital.\n\nHe turned and saw Laurine and Valnar standing at the other side of the\nbed. Laurine's hand was bandaged and her face scratched but otherwise\nshe seemed uninjured. She smiled at him.\n\n\"That was close,\" said Valnar and Barlow looked at him. The strange man\nhad entirely recovered his good humor and confidence. Barlow saw that\nhe was again wearing the plaque.\n\n\"Did we all go crazy?\" Barlow asked.\n\n\"Just a bit more than usual,\" Valnar grinned. \"I got to thinking about\nwhat you told me about the Unamenables, and came to the conclusion that\nthe Mental Ray only controlled the average person. Those who varied\nfrom the norm, either above or below, were affected differently. To\nthem it was an irritant. Haven't you ever thought it odd that all the\nUnamenables fought Dodson?\n\n\"So when we were captured because the warden reported our visit, I\nagreed to help Dodson. He had scientists, anyway. They sure blanked the\nprojector that night. Dodson wanted me to make the projector deadly.\nI did, then Dodson was quite amused when I suggested that he try it\nout on you Unamenables. But instead of killing you, it aroused you\nto intense activity. The only thing that went wrong was that Dodson\ncrossed me, and the ray was too strong for me to compensate. I was laid\nout cold.\"\n\n\"We've won, Joel,\" Laurine interrupted. \"Dodson is dead. And we've\nreleased all the members from the prisons, and destroyed the\ntransmitters.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Valnar. \"My job here is done, so I'll be getting along.\nI want to kill Dodson again, this time personally.\"\n\nBarlow forced Laurine to sit on the edge of the bed. Then held her hand\nto make sure that she stayed there, and faced Valnar.\n\n\"Why don't you stay here?\" he asked.\n\nValnar shook his head. \"I got to see about getting home,\" he said,\nstarting to go. \"So long.\"\n\n\"Wait!\" called Barlow. \"Where are you going this time?\" he asked when\nValnar halted. \"All the way back to the beginning?\"\n\n\"I've already been there,\" said Valnar. \"That was my first trip. I had\na car then, but the elemental chaos ruined it and I was barely able to\nget away in time.\"\n\nA sudden thought struck Barlow. He grinned at Valnar.\n\nValnar frowned and demanded, \"Well?\"\n\n\"Remember your simile of time to a growing tree with a lot of branches?\"\n\nValnar nodded and waited.\n\n\"And remember how you said that you were creating new branches every\ntime you stopped?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" Valnar grunted impatiently.\n\n\"Well, I'll bet you haven't been sliding up and down the branches\nof that tree at all. You've been leaping from one to another like a\nmonkey. And you weren't in your own past before you started, so you\ncan't be now. You aren't in your own time at all. When you leaped back\nto elemental chaos, you planted this tree. You're climbing around the\nwrong tree, fella.\"\n\nValnar started, then stared. \"I guess I'll stay here for a while after\nall,\" he muttered as he turned and went out.\n\nLaurine was watching Barlow. \"You were trying to sell him something\nthen,\" she accused.\n\n\"Sure,\" he admitted easily. \"Think of the world-limb we can build if he\nstays with us.\" He laughed and drew her face down to his.",
