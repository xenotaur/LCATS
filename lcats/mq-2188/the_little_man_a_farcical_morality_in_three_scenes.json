At several little tables outside the buffet persons\n     are taking refreshment, served by a pale young waiter.  On a\n     seat against the wall of the buffet a woman of lowly station is\n     sitting beside two large bundles, on one of which she has placed\n     her baby, swathed in a black shawl.\n\nWAITER.  [Approaching a table whereat sit an English traveller and\nhis wife]  Two coffee?\n\nENGLISHMAN.  [Paying]  Thanks.  [To his wife, in an Oxford voice]\nSugar?\n\nENGLISHWOMAN.  [In a Cambridge voice]  One.\n\nAMERICAN TRAVELLER.  [With field-glasses and a pocket camera from\nanother table]  Waiter, I'd like to have you get my eggs.  I've been\nsitting here quite a while.\n\nWAITER.  Yes, sare.\n\nGERMAN TRAVELLER.  'Kellner, bezahlen'!  [His voice is, like his\nmoustache, stiff and brushed up at the ends.  His figure also is\nstiff and his hair a little grey; clearly once, if not now, a\ncolonel.]\n\nWAITER.  'Komm' gleich'!\n\n     [The baby on the bundle wails.  The mother takes it up to soothe\n     it.  A young, red-cheeked Dutchman at the fourth table stops\n     eating and laughs.]\n\nAMERICAN.  My eggs!  Get a wiggle on you!\n\nWAITER.  Yes, sare.  [He rapidly recedes.]\n\n     [A LITTLE MAN in a soft hat is seen to the right of tables.  He\n     stands a moment looking after the hurrying waiter, then seats\n     himself at the fifth table.]\n\nENGLISHMAN.  [Looking at his watch]  Ten minutes more.\n\nENGLISHWOMAN.  Bother!\n\nAMERICAN.  [Addressing them]  'Pears as if they'd a prejudice against\neggs here, anyway.\n\n     [The ENGLISH look at him, but do not speak. ]\n\nGERMAN.  [In creditable English]  In these places man can get\nnothing.\n\n     [The WAITER comes flying back with a compote for the DUTCH\n     YOUTH, who pays.]\n\nGERMAN.  'Kellner, bezahlen'!\n\nWAITER.  'Eine Krone sechzig'.\n\n     [The GERMAN pays.]\n\nAMERICAN.  [Rising, and taking out his watch--blandly]  See here.  If\nI don't get my eggs before this watch ticks twenty, there'll be\nanother waiter in heaven.\n\nWAITER.  [Flying] 'Komm' gleich'!\n\nAMERICAN.  [Seeking sympathy]  I'm gettin' kind of mad!\n\n     [The ENGLISHMAN halves his newspaper and hands the advertisement\n     half to his wife.  The BABY wails.  The MOTHER rocks it.]\n\n     [The DUTCH YOUTH stops eating and laughs.  The GERMAN lights a\n     cigarette.  The LITTLE MAN sits motionless, nursing his hat.\n     The WAITER comes flying back with the eggs and places them\n     before the AMERICAN.]\n\nAMERICAN.  [Putting away his watch]  Good!  I don't like trouble.\nHow much?\n\n     [He pays and eats.  The WAITER stands a moment at the edge of\n     the platform and passes his hand across his brow.  The LITTLE\n     MAN eyes him and speaks gently.]\n\nLITTLE MAN.  Herr Ober!\n\n     [The WAITER turns.]\n\nMight I have a glass of beer?\n\nWAITER.  Yes, sare.\n\nLITTLE MAN.  Thank you very much.\n\n     [The WAITER goes.]\n\nAMERICAN.  [Pausing in the deglutition of his eggs--affably]  Pardon\nme, sir; I'd like to have you tell me why you called that little bit\nof a feller \"Herr Ober.\"  Reckon you would know what that means?\nMr. Head Waiter.\n\nLITTLE MAN.  Yes, yes.\n\nAMERICAN.  I smile.\n\nLITTLE MAN.  Oughtn't I to call him that?\n\nGERMAN.  [Abruptly] 'Nein--Kellner'.\n\nAMERICAN.  Why, yes!  Just \"waiter.\"\n\n     [The ENGLISHWOMAN looks round her paper for a second.  The DUTCH\n     YOUTH stops eating and laughs.  The LITTLE MAN gazes from face\n     to face and nurses his hat.]\n\nLITTLE MAN.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings.\n\nGERMAN.  Gott!\n\nAMERICAN.  In my country we're very democratic--but that's quite a\nproposition.\n\nENGLISHMAN.  [Handling coffee-pot, to his wife]  More?\n\nENGLISHWOMAN.  No, thanks.\n\nGERMAN.  [Abruptly]  These fellows--if you treat them in this manner,\nat once they take liberties.  You see, you will not get your beer.\n\n     [As he speaks the WAITER returns, bringing the LITTLE MAN'S\n     beer, then retires.]\n\nAMERICAN.  That 'pears to be one up to democracy.  [To the LITTLE\nMAN]  I judge you go in for brotherhood?\n\nLITTLE MAN.  [Startled]  Oh, no!\n\nAMERICAN.  I take considerable stock in Leo Tolstoi myself.  Grand\nman--grand-souled apparatus.  But I guess you've got to pinch those\nwaiters some to make 'em skip.  [To the ENGLISH, who have carelessly\nlooked his way for a moment]  You'll appreciate that, the way he\nacted about my eggs.\n\n     [The ENGLISH make faint motions with their chins and avert their\n     eyes.]\n\n     [To the WAITER, who is standing at the door of the buffet]\n\nWaiter!  Flash of beer--jump, now!\n\nWAITER.  'Komm' gleich'!\n\nGERMAN.  'Cigarren'!\n\nWAITER.  'Schon'!\n\n     [He disappears.]\n\nAMERICAN.  [Affably--to the LITTLE MAN]  Now, if I don't get that\nflash of beer quicker'n you got yours, I shall admire.\n\nGERMAN.  [Abruptly]  Tolstoi is nothing 'nichts'!  No good!  Ha?\n\nAMERICAN.  [Relishing the approach of argument]  Well, that is a\nmatter of temperament.  Now, I'm all for equality.  See that poor\nwoman there--very humble woman--there she sits among us with her\nbaby.  Perhaps you'd like to locate her somewhere else?\n\nGERMAN.  [Shrugging].  Tolstoi is 'sentimentalisch'.  Nietzsche is\nthe true philosopher, the only one.\n\nAMERICAN.  Well, that's quite in the prospectus--very stimulating\nparty--old Nietch--virgin mind.  But give me Leo!  [He turns to the\nred-cheeked YOUTH]  What do you opine, sir?  I guess by your labels\nyou'll be Dutch.  Do they read Tolstoi in your country?\n\n     [The DUTCH YOUTH laughs.]\n\nAMERICAN.  That is a very luminous answer.\n\nGERMAN.  Tolstoi is nothing.  Man should himself express.  He must\npush--he must be strong.\n\nAMERICAN.  That is so.  In America we believe in virility; we like a\nman to expand.  But we believe in brotherhood too.  We draw the line\nat niggers; but we aspire.  Social barriers and distinctions we've\nnot much use for.\n\nENGLISHMAN.  Do you feel a draught?\n\nENGLISHWOMAN.  [With a shiver of her shoulder toward the AMERICAN]  I\ndo--rather.\n\nGERMAN.  Wait!  You are a young people.\n\nAMERICAN.  That is so; there are no flies on us.  [To the LITTLE MAN,\nwho has been gazing eagerly from face to face]  Say!  I'd like to\nhave you give us your sentiments in relation to the duty of man.\n\n     [The LITTLE MAN, fidgets, and is about to opens his mouth.]\n\nAMERICAN.  For example--is it your opinion that we should kill off\nthe weak and diseased, and all that can't jump around?\n\nGERMAN.  [Nodding] 'Ja, ja'!  That is coming.\n\nLITTLE MAN.  [Looking from face to face]  They might be me.\n\n     [The DUTCH YOUTH laughs.]\n\nAMERICAN.  [Reproving him with a look]  That's true humility.\n'Tisn't grammar.  Now, here's a proposition that brings it nearer the\nbone:  Would you step out of your way to help them when it was liable\nto bring you trouble?\n\nGERMAN.  'Nein, nein'!  That is stupid.\n\nLITTLE MAN.  [Eager but wistful]  I'm afraid not.  Of course one\nwants to--There was St Francis d'Assisi and St Julien L'Hospitalier,\nand----\n\nAMERICAN.  Very lofty dispositions.  Guess they died of them.  [He\nrises]  Shake hands, sir--my name is--[He hands a card]  I am an\nice-machine maker.  [He shakes the LITTLE MAN's hand] I like your\nsentiments--I feel kind of brotherly.  [Catching sight of the WAITER\nappearing in the doorway]  Waiter; where to h-ll is that glass of\nbeer?\n\nGERMAN.  Cigarren!\n\nWAITER.  'Komm' gleich'!\n\nENGLISHMAN.  [Consulting watch]  Train's late.\n\nENGLISHWOMAN.  Really!  Nuisance!\n\n     [A station POLICEMAN, very square and uniformed, passes and\n     repasses.]\n\nAMERICAN.  [Resuming his seat--to the GERMAN]  Now, we don't have so\nmuch of that in America.  Guess we feel more to trust in human\nnature.\n\nGERMAN.  Ah!  ha!  you will bresently find there is nothing in him\nbut self.\n\nLITTLE MAN.  [Wistfully]  Don't you believe in human nature?\n\nAMERICAN.  Very stimulating question.\n\n     [He looks round for opinions.  The DUTCH YOUTH laughs.]\n\nENGLISHMAN. [Holding out his half of the paper to his wife]  Swap!\n\n     [His wife swaps.]\n\nGERMAN.  In human nature I believe so far as I can see him--no more.\n\nAMERICAN.  Now that 'pears to me kind o' blasphemy.  I believe in\nheroism.  I opine there's not one of us settin' around here that's\nnot a hero--give him the occasion.\n\nLITTLE MAN.  Oh!  Do you believe that?\n\nAMERICAN.  Well!  I judge a hero is just a person that'll help\nanother at the expense of himself.  Take that poor woman there.\nWell, now, she's a heroine, I guess.  She would die for her baby any\nold time.\n\nGERMAN.  Animals will die for their babies.  That is nothing.\n\nAMERICAN.  I carry it further.  I postulate we would all die for that\nbaby if a locomotive was to trundle up right here and try to handle\nit.  [To the GERMAN]  I guess you don't know how good you are.  [As\nthe GERMAN is twisting up the ends of his moustache--to the\nENGLISHWOMAN]  I should like to have you express an opinion, ma'am.\n\nENGLISHWOMAN.  I beg your pardon.\n\nAMERICAN.  The English are very humanitarian; they have a very high\nsense of duty.  So have the Germans, so have the Americans.  [To the\nDUTCH YOUTH]  I judge even in your little country they have that.\nThis is an epoch of equality and high-toned ideals.  [To the LITTLE\nMAN]  What is your nationality, sir?\n\nLITTLE MAN.  I'm afraid I'm nothing particular.  My father was\nhalf-English and half-American, and my mother half-German and\nhalf-Dutch.\n\nAMERICAN.  My!  That's a bit streaky, any old way.  [The POLICEMAN\npasses again]  Now, I don't believe we've much use any more for those\ngentlemen in buttons.  We've grown kind of mild--we don't think of\nself as we used to do.\n\n     [The WAITER has appeared in the doorway.]\n\nGERMAN.  [In a voice of thunder] 'Cigarren!  Donnerwetter'!\n\nAMERICAN.  [Shaking his fist at the vanishing WAITER]  That flash of\nbeer!\n\nWAITER.  'Komm' gleich'!\n\nAMERICAN.  A little more, and he will join George Washington!  I was\nabout to remark when he intruded: In this year of grace 1913 the\nkingdom of Christ is quite a going concern.  We are mighty near\nuniversal brotherhood.  The colonel here [He indicates the GERMAN] is\na man of blood and iron, but give him an opportunity to be\nmagnanimous, and he'll be right there.  Oh, sir!  yep!\n\n     [The GERMAN, with a profound mixture of pleasure and cynicism,\n     brushes up the ends of his moustache.]\n\nLITTLE MAN.  I wonder.  One wants to, but somehow--[He shakes his\nhead.]\n\nAMERICAN. You seem kind of skeery about that.  You've had experience,\nmaybe.  I'm an optimist--I think we're bound to make the devil hum in\nthe near future.  I opine we shall occasion a good deal of trouble to\nthat old party.  There's about to be a holocaust of selfish\ninterests.  The colonel there with old-man Nietch he won't know\nhimself.  There's going to be a very sacred opportunity.\n\n     [As he speaks, the voice of a RAILWAY OFFICIAL is heard an the\n     distance calling out in German.  It approaches, and the words\n     become audible.]\n\nGERMAN.  [Startled] 'Der Teufel'!  [He gets up, and seizes the bag\nbeside him.]\n\n     [The STATION OFFICIAL has appeared; he stands for a moment\n     casting his commands at the seated group.  The DUTCH YOUTH also\n     rises, and takes his coat and hat.  The OFFICIAL turns on his\n     heel and retires still issuing directions.]\n\nENGLISHMAN.  What does he say?\n\nGERMAN.  Our drain has come in, de oder platform; only one minute we\nhaf.\n\n     [All, have risen in a fluster.]\n\nAMERICAN.  Now, that's very provoking.  I won't get that flash of\nbeer.\n\n     [There is a general scurry to gather coats and hats and wraps,\n     during which the lowly WOMAN is seen making desperate attempts\n     to deal with her baby and the two large bundles.  Quite\n     defeated, she suddenly puts all down, wrings her hands, and\n     cries out: \"Herr Jesu!  Hilfe!\"  The flying procession turn\n     their heads at that strange cry.]\n\nAMERICAN.  What's that?  Help?\n\n     [He continues to run.  The LITTLE MAN spins round, rushes back,\n     picks up baby and bundle on which it was seated.]\n\nLITTLE MAN.  Come along, good woman, come along!\n\n     [The WOMAN picks up the other bundle and they run.]\n\n     [The WAITER, appearing in the doorway with the bottle of beer,\n     watches with his tired smile.]\n\n\n                              CURTAIN\n\n\n\n\nSCENE II\n\n     A second-class compartment of a corridor carriage, in motion.\n     In it are seated the ENGLISHMAN and his WIFE, opposite each\n     other at the corridor end, she with her face to the engine, he\n     with his back.  Both are somewhat protected from the rest of the\n     travellers by newspapers.  Next to her sits the GERMAN, and\n     opposite him sits the AMERICAN; next the AMERICAN in one window\n     corner is seated the DUTCH YOUTH; the other window corner is\n     taken by the GERMAN'S bag.  The silence is only broken by the\n     slight rushing noise of the train's progression and the\n     crackling of the English newspapers.\n\nAMERICAN.  [Turning to the DUTCH YOUTH]  Guess I'd like that window\nraised; it's kind of chilly after that old run they gave us.\n\n     [The DUTCH YOUTH laughs, and goes through the motions of raising\n     the window.  The ENGLISH regard the operation with uneasy\n     irritation.  The GERMAN opens his bag, which reposes on the\n     corner seat next him, and takes out a book.]\n\nAMERICAN.  The Germans are great readers.  Very stimulating practice.\nI read most anything myself!\n\n     [The GERMAN holds up the book so that the title may be read.]\n\n\"Don Quixote\"--fine book.  We Americans take considerable stock in\nold man Quixote.  Bit of a wild-cat--but we don't laugh at him.\n\nGERMAN.  He is dead.  Dead as a sheep.  A good thing, too.\n\nAMERICAN.  In America we have still quite an amount of chivalry.\n\nGERMAN.  Chivalry is nothing 'sentimentalisch'.  In modern days--no\ngood.  A man must push, he must pull.\n\nAMERICAN.  So you say.  But I judge your form of chivalry is\nsacrifice to the state.  We allow more freedom to the individual\nsoul.  Where there's something little and weak, we feel it kind of\nnoble to give up to it.  That way we feel elevated.\n\n     [As he speaks there is seen in the corridor doorway the LITTLE\n     MAN, with the WOMAN'S BABY still on his arm and the bundle held\n     in the other hand.  He peers in anxiously.  The ENGLISH, acutely\n     conscious, try to dissociate themselves from his presence with\n     their papers.  The DUTCH YOUTH laughs.]\n\nGERMAN.  'Ach'!  So!\n\nAMERICAN.  Dear me!\n\nLITTLE MAN.  Is there room?  I can't find a seat.\n\nAMERICAN.  Why, yes!  There's a seat for one.\n\nLITTLE MAN.  [Depositing bundle outside, and heaving BABY]  May I?\n\nAMERICAN.  Come right in!\n\n     [The GERMAN sulkily moves his bag.  The LITTLE MAN comes in and\n     seats himself gingerly.]\n\nAMERICAN.  Where's the mother?\n\nLITTLE MAN.  [Ruefully]  Afraid she got left behind.\n\n     [The DUTCH YOUTH laughs.  The ENGLISH unconsciously emerge from\n     their newspapers.]\n\nAMERICAN.  My!  That would appear to be quite a domestic incident.\n\n     [The ENGLISHMAN suddenly utters a profound \"Ha, Ha!\" and\n     disappears behind his paper.  And that paper and the one\n     opposite are seen to shake, and little sguirls and squeaks\n     emerge.]\n\nGERMAN.  And you haf got her bundle, and her baby.  Ha!  [He cackles\ndrily.]\n\nAMERICAN.  [Gravely]  I smile.  I guess Providence has played it\npretty low down on you.  It's sure acted real mean.\n\n     [The BABY wails, and the LITTLE MAN jigs it with a sort of\n     gentle desperation, looking apologetically from face to face.\n     His wistful glance renews the fore of merriment wherever it\n     alights.  The AMERICAN alone preserves a gravity which seems\n     incapable of being broken.]\n\nAMERICAN.  Maybe you'd better get off right smart and restore that\nbaby.  There's nothing can act madder than a mother.\n\nLITTLE MAN.  Poor thing, yes!  What she must be suffering!\n\n     [A gale of laughter shakes the carriage.  The ENGLISH for a\n     moment drop their papers, the better to indulge.  The LITTLE MAN\n     smiles a wintry smile.]\n\nAMERICAN.  [In a lull]  How did it eventuate?\n\nLITTLE MAN.  We got there just as the train was going to start; and I\njumped, thinking I could help her up.  But it moved too quickly,\nand--and left her.\n\n     [The gale of laughter blows up again.]\n\nAMERICAN.  Guess I'd have thrown the baby out to her.\n\nLITTLE MAN.  I was afraid the poor little thing might break.\n\n     [The Baby wails; the LITTLE MAN heaves it; the gale of laughter\n     blows.]\n\nAMERICAN.  [Gravely]  It's highly entertaining--not for the baby.\nWhat kind of an old baby is it, anyway?  [He sniff's]  I judge it's a\nbit--niffy.\n\nLITTLE MAN.  Afraid I've hardly looked at it yet.\n\nAMERICAN.  Which end up is it?\n\nLITTLE MAM.  Oh!  I think the right end.  Yes, yes, it is.\n\nAMERICAN.  Well, that's something.  Maybe you should hold it out of\nwindow a bit.  Very excitable things, babies!\n\nENGLISHWOMAN.  [Galvanized]  No, no!\n\nENGLISHMAN.  [Touching her knee]  My dear!\n\nAMERICAN.  You are right, ma'am.  I opine there's a draught out\nthere.  This baby is precious.  We've all of us got stock in this\nbaby in a manner of speaking.  This is a little bit of universal\nbrotherhood.  Is it a woman baby?\n\nLITTLE MAN.  I--I can only see the top of its head.\n\nAMERICAN.  You can't always tell from that.  It looks kind of\nover-wrapped up.  Maybe it had better be unbound.\n\nGERMAN.  'Nein, nein, nein'!\n\nAMERICAN.  I think you are very likely right, colonel.  It might be a\npity to unbind that baby.  I guess the lady should be consulted in\nthis matter.\n\nENGLISHWOMAN.  Yes, yes, of course----!\n\nENGLISHMAN.  [Touching her]  Let it be!  Little beggar seems all\nright.\n\nAMERICAN.  That would seem only known to Providence at this moment.\nI judge it might be due to humanity to look at its face.\n\nLITTLE MAN.  [Gladly]  It's sucking my' finger.  There, there--nice\nlittle thing--there!\n\nAMERICAN.  I would surmise in your leisure moments you have created\nbabies, sir?\n\nLITTLE MAN.  Oh! no--indeed, no.\n\nAMERICAN.  Dear me!--That is a loss.  [Addressing himself to the\ncarriage at large]  I think we may esteem ourselves fortunate to have\nthis little stranger right here with us.  Demonstrates what a hold\nthe little and weak have upon us nowadays.  The colonel here--a man\nof blood and iron--there he sits quite calm next door to it.  [He\nsniffs]  Now, this baby is rather chastening--that is a sign of\ngrace, in the colonel--that is true heroism.\n\nLITTLE MAN.  [Faintly]  I--I can see its face a little now.\n\n     [All bend forward.]\n\nAMERICAN.  What sort of a physiognomy has it, anyway?\n\nLITTLE MAN.  [Still faintly]  I don't see anything but--but spots.\n\nGERMAN.  Oh!  Ha!  Pfui!\n\n     [The DUTCH YOUTH laughs.]\n\nAMERICAN.  I am told that is not uncommon amongst babies.  Perhaps we\ncould have you inform us, ma'am.\n\nENGLISHWOMAN.  Yes, of course--only what sort of----\n\nLITTLE MAN.  They seem all over its----[At the slight recoil of\neveryone] I feel sure it's--it's quite a good baby underneath.\n\nAMERICAN.  That will be rather difficult to come at.  I'm just a bit\nsensitive.  I've very little use for affections of the epidermis.\n\nGERMAN.  Pfui!  [He has edged away as far as he can get, and is\nlighting a big cigar]\n\n     [The DUTCH YOUTH draws his legs back.]\n\nAMERICAN.  [Also taking out a cigar]  I guess it would be well to\nfumigate this carriage.  Does it suffer, do you think?\n\nLITTLE MAN.  [Peering]  Really, I don't--I'm not sure--I know so\nlittle about babies.  I think it would have a nice expression--if--if\nit showed.\n\nAMERICAN.  Is it kind of boiled looking?\n\nLITTLE MAN.  Yes--yes, it is.\n\nAMERICAN.  [Looking gravely round]  I judge this baby has the\nmeasles.\n\n     [The GERMAN screws himself spasmodically against the arm of the\n     ENGLISHWOMAN'S seat.]\n\nENGLISHWOMAN.  Poor little thing!  Shall I----?\n\n     [She half rises.]\n\nENGLISHMAN.  [Touching her]  No, no----Dash it!\n\nAMERICAN.  I honour your emotion, ma'am.  It does credit to us all.\nBut I sympathize with your husband too.  The measles is a very\nimportant pestilence in connection with a grown woman.\n\nLITTLE MAN.  It likes my finger awfully.  Really, it's rather a sweet\nbaby.\n\nAMERICAN.  [Sniffing]  Well, that would appear to be quite a\nquestion.  About them spots, now?  Are they rosy?\n\nLITTLE MAN.  No-o; they're dark, almost black.\n\nGERMAN.  Gott!  Typhus!  [He bounds up on to the arm of the\nENGLISHWOMAN'S Seat.]\n\nAMERICAN.  Typhus!  That's quite an indisposition!\n\n     [The DUTCH YOUTH rises suddenly, and bolts out into the\n     corridor.  He is followed by the GERMAN, puffing clouds of\n     smoke.  The ENGLISH and AMERICAN sit a moment longer without\n     speaking.  The ENGLISHWOMAN'S face is turned with a curious\n     expression--half pity, half fear--towards the LITTLE MAN.  Then\n     the ENGLISHMAN gets up.]\n\nENGLISHMAN.  Bit stuffy for you here, dear, isn't it?\n\n     [He puts his arm through hers, raises her, and almost pushes her\n     through the doorway.  She goes, still looking back.]\n\nAMERICAN.  [Gravely]  There's nothing I admire more'n courage.  Guess\nI'll go and smoke in the corridor.\n\n     [As he goes out the LITTLE MAN looks very wistfully after him.\n     Screwing up his mouth and nose, he holds the BABY away from him\n     and wavers; then rising, he puts it on the seat opposite and\n     goes through the motions of letting down the window.  Having\n     done so he looks at the BABY, who has begun to wail.  Suddenly\n     he raises his hands and clasps them, like a child praying.\n     Since, however, the BABY does not stop wailing, he hovers over\n     it in indecision; then, picking it up, sits down again to dandle\n     it, with his face turned toward the open window.  Finding that\n     it still wails, he begins to sing to it in a cracked little\n     voice.  It is charmed at once.  While he is singing, the\n     AMERICAN appears in the corridor.  Letting down the passage\n     window, he stands there in the doorway with the draught blowing\n     his hair and the smoke of his cigar all about him.  The LITTLE\n     MAN stops singing and shifts the shawl higher to protect the\n     BABY'S head from the draught.]\n\nAMERICAN.  [Gravely]  This is the most sublime spectacle I have ever\nenvisaged.  There ought to be a record of this.\n\n     [The LITTLE MAN looks at him, wondering.  You are typical, sir,\n     of the sentiments of modern Christianity.  You illustrate the\n     deepest feelings in the heart of every man.]\n\n     [The LITTLE MAN rises with the BABY and a movement of approach.]\n\nGuess I'm wanted in the dining-car.\n\n     [He vanishes.  The LITTLE MAN sits down again, but back to the\n     engine, away from the draught, and looks out of the window,\n     patiently jogging the BABY On his knee.]\n\n\n                              CURTAIN\n\n\n\n\nSCENE III\n\n     An arrival platform.  The LITTLE MAN, with the BABY and the\n     bundle, is standing disconsolate, while travellers pass and\n     luggage is being carried by.  A STATION OFFICIAL, accompanied by\n     a POLICEMAN, appears from a doorway, behind him.\n\nOFFICIAL.  [Consulting telegram in his hand] 'Das ist der Herr'.\n\n     [They advance to the LITTLE MAN.]\n\nOFFICIAL.  'Sie haben einen Buben gestohlen'?\n\nLITTLE MAN.  I only speak English and American.\n\nOFFICIAL.  'Dies ist nicht Ihr Bube'?\n\n     [He touches the Baby.]\n\nLITTLE MAN.

'Komm mit us'.\n\n     [They take the LITTLE MAN toward the door from which they have\n     come.  A voice stops them.]\n\nAMERICAN.  [Speaking from as far away as may be]  Just a moment!\n\n     [The OFFICIAL stops; the LITTLE MAN also stops and sits down on\n     a bench against the wall.  The POLICEMAN stands stolidly beside\n     him.  The AMERICAN approaches a step or two, beckoning; the\n     OFFICIAL goes up to him.]\n\nAMERICAN.  Guess you've got an angel from heaven there!  What's the\ngentleman in buttons for?\n\nOFFICIAL.  'Was ist das'?\n\nAMERICAN.  Is there anybody here that can understand American?\n\nOFFICIAL.  'Verstehe nicht'.\n\nAMERICAN.  Well, just watch my gestures.  I was saying [He points to\nthe LITTLE MAN, then makes gestures of flying]  you have an angel\nfrom heaven there.  You have there a man in whom Gawd [He points\nupward]  takes quite an amount of stock.  You have no call to arrest\nhim.  [He makes the gesture of arrest]  No, Sir.

'Das macht nichts'--gut or no gut, I muss mein duty do.\n[He turns to go toward the LITTLE MAN.]\n\nAMERICAN.  Oh!  Very well, arrest him; do your duty.  This baby has\ntyphus.\n\n     [At the word \"typhus\" the OFFICIAL stops.]\n\nAMERICAN.  [Making gestures]  First-class typhus, black typhus,\nschwarzen typhus.  Now you have it.

The\n     OFFICIAL is muttering, greatly incensed.]\n\nAMERICAN.  What does that body-snatcher say?\n\nGERMAN.

Guess we would all act\nnoble that way, give us the chance.\n\n     [The LITTLE MAN rises, holding out the BABY, and advances a step\n     or two.  The half-moon at once gives, increasing its size; the\n     AMERICAN climbs on to a higher trunk.  The LITTLE MAN retires\n     and again sits down.]\n\nAMERICAN.  [Addressing the OFFICIAL]  Guess you'd better go out of\nbusiness and wait for the mother.\n\nOFFICIAL.  [Stamping his foot]  Die Mutter sall 'rested be for taking\nout baby mit typhus.  Ha!

'Pears to me\nyou don't suspicion just how beautiful this is.  Here we have a man\ngiving his life for that old baby that's got no claim on him.  This\nis not a baby of his own making.  No, sir, this is a very Christ-like\nproposition in the gentleman.\n\nOFFICIAL.  Put ze baby down, or ich will goummand someone it to do.\n\nAMERICAN.  That will be very interesting to watch.\n\nOFFICIAL.  [To POLICEMAN]  Dake it vrom him.\n\n     [The POLICEMAN mutters, but does not.]\n\nAMERICAN.  [To the German]  Guess I lost that.\n\nGERMAN.

What a man this is!  What a\nsublime sense of duty!\n\n     [The DUTCH YOUTH laughs.  The OFFICIAL turns on him, but as he\n     does so the MOTHER of the Busy is seen hurrying.]\n\nMOTHER.  'Ach!  Ach!  Mei' Bubi'!\n\n     [Her face is illumined; she is about to rush to the LITTLE MAN.]\n\nOFFICIAL.  [To the POLICEMAN]  'Nimm die Frau'!\n\n     [The POLICEMAN catches hold of the WOMAN.]\n\nOFFICIAL.  [To the frightened WOMAN] 'Warum haben Sie einen Buben mit\nTyphus mit ausgebracht'?\n\nAMERICAN.  [Eagerly, from his perch]  What was that?  I don't want to\nmiss any.\n\nGERMAN.  He say: Why did you a baby with typhus with you bring out?\n\nAMERICAN.  Well, that's quite a question.\n\n     [He takes out the field-glasses slung around him and adjusts\n     them on the BABY.]\n\nMOTHER.  [Bewildered] Mei' Bubi--Typhus--aber Typhus?  [She shakes\nher head violently]  'Nein, nein, nein!  Typhus'!\n\nOFFICIAL.  Er hat Typhus.\n\nMOTHER.  [Shaking her head]  'Nein, nein, nein'!\n\nAMERICAN.

[Turning on him furiously]  Er hat Typhus.\n\nAMERICAN.  Now, that's where you slop over.  Come right here.\n\n     [The OFFICIAL mounts, and looks through the glasses.]\n\nAMERICAN.  [To the LITTLE MAN]  Skin out the baby's leg.  If we don't\nlocate spots on that, it'll be good enough for me.\n\n     [The LITTLE MAN fumbles Out the BABY'S little white foot.]\n\nMOTHER.  Mei' Bubi!  [She tries to break away.]\n\nAMERICAN.  White as a banana.  [To the OFFICIAL--affably]  Guess\nyou've made kind of a fool of us with your old typhus.\n\nOFFICIAL.  Lass die Frau!\n\n     [The POLICEMAN lets her go, and she rushes to her BABY.]\n\nMOTHER.  Mei' Bubi!\n\n     [The BABY, exchanging the warmth of the LITTLE MAN for the\n     momentary chill of its MOTHER, wails.]\n\nOFFICIAL.  [Descending and beckoning to the POLICEMAN] 'Sie wollen\nden Herrn accusiren'?\n\n     [The POLICEMAN takes the LITTLE MAN's arm.]\n\nAMERICAN.  What's that?  They goin' to pitch him after all?\n\n     [The MOTHER, still hugging her BABY, who has stopped crying,\n     gazes at the LITTLE MAN, who sits dazedly looking up.  Suddenly\n     she drops on her knees, and with her free hand lifts his booted\n     foot and kisses it.]\n\nAMERICAN.  [Waving his hat]  Ra!  Ra!  [He descends swiftly, goes up\nto the LITTLE MAN, whose arm the POLICEMAN has dropped, and takes his\nhand]  Brother; I am proud to know you.  This is one of the greatest\nmoments I have ever experienced.  [Displaying the LITTLE MAN to the\nassembled company]  I think I sense the situation when I say that we\nall esteem it an honour to breathe the rather inferior atmosphere of\nthis station here Along with our little friend.  I guess we shall all\ngo home and treasure the memory of his face as the whitest thing in\nour museum of recollections.  And perhaps this good woman will also\ngo home and wash the face of our little brother here.  I am inspired\nwith a new faith in mankind.  Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to present\nto you a sure-enough saint--only wants a halo, to be transfigured.\n[To the LITTLE MAN]  Stand right up.\n\n     [The LITTLE MAN stands up bewildered.  They come about him.  The\n     OFFICIAL bows to him, the POLICEMAN salutes him.  The DUTCH\n     YOUTH shakes his head and laughs.  The GERMAN draws himself up\n     very straight, and bows quickly twice.  The ENGLISHMAN and his\n     WIFE approach at least two steps, then, thinking better of it,\n     turn to each other and recede.  The MOTHER kisses his hand.  The\n     PORTER returning with the Sanitatsmachine, turns it on from\n     behind, and its pinkish shower, goldened by a ray of sunlight,\n     falls around the LITTLE MAN's head, transfiguring it as he\n     stands with eyes upraised to see whence the portent comes.]\n\nAMERICAN.  [Rushing forward and dropping on his knees]  Hold on just\na minute!  Guess I'll take a snapshot of the miracle.  [He adjusts\nhis pocket camera]  This ought to look bully!\n\n\nCURTAIN",
