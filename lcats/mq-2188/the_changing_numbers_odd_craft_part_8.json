    "body": "\nTHE CHANGING NUMBERS\n\nThe tall clock in the corner of the small living-room had just struck\neight as Mr. Samuel Gunnill came stealthily down the winding staircase\nand, opening the door at the foot, stepped with an appearance of great\ncare and humility into the room.  He noticed with some anxiety that his\ndaughter Selina was apparently engrossed in her task of attending to the\nplants in the window, and that no preparations whatever had been made for\nbreakfast.\n\nMiss Gunnill's horticultural duties seemed interminable.  She snipped off\ndead leaves with painstaking precision, and administered water with the\njealous care of a druggist compounding a prescription; then, with her\nback still toward him, she gave vent to a sigh far too intense in its\nnature to have reference to such trivialities as plants.  She repeated it\ntwice, and at the second time Mr. Gunnill, almost without his knowledge,\nuttered a deprecatory cough.\n\nHis daughter turned with alarming swiftness and, holding herself very\nupright, favoured him with a glance in which indignation and surprise\nwere very fairly mingled.\n\n\"That white one--that one at the end,\" said Mr. Gunnill, with an\nappearance of concentrated interest, \"that's my fav'rite.\"\n\nMiss Gunnill put her hands together, and a look of infinite\nlong-suffering came upon her face, but she made no reply.\n\n\"Always has been,\" continued Mr. Gunnill, feverishly, \"from a--from a\ncutting.\"\n\n\"Bailed out,\" said Miss Gunnill, in a deep and thrilling voice; \"bailed\nout at one o'clock in the morning, brought home singing loud enough for\nhalf-a-dozen, and then talking about flowers!\"\n\nMr. Gunnill coughed again.\n\n\"I was dreaming,\" pursued Miss Gunnill, plaintively, \"sleeping\npeacefully, when I was awoke by a horrible noise.\"\n\n\"That couldn't ha' been me,\" protested her father.  \"I was only a bit\ncheerful.  It was Benjamin Ely's birthday yesterday, and after we left\nthe Lion they started singing, and I just hummed to keep 'em company.  I\nwasn't singing, mind you, only humming--when up comes that interfering\nCooper and takes me off.\"\n\nMiss Gunnill shivered, and with her pretty cheek in her hand sat by the\nwindow the very picture of despondency.  \"Why didn't he take the others?\"\nshe inquired.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Gunnill, with great emphasis, \"that's what a lot more of\nus would like to know.  P'r'aps if you'd been more polite to Mrs. Cooper,\ninstead o' putting it about that she looked young enough to be his\nmother, it wouldn't have happened.\"\n\nHis daughter shook her head impatiently and, on Mr. Gunnill making an\nallusion to breakfast, expressed surprise that he had got the heart to\neat any-thing.  Mr. Gunnill pressing the point, however, she arose and\nbegan to set the table, the undue care with which she smoothed out the\ncreases of the table-cloth, and the mathematical exactness with which she\nplaced the various articles, all being so many extra smarts in his wound.\nWhen she finally placed on the table enough food for a dozen people he\nbegan to show signs of a little spirit.\n\n\"Ain't you going to have any?\" he demanded, as Miss Gunnill resumed her\nseat by the window.\n\n\"Me?\" said the girl, with a shudder.  \"Breakfast?  The disgrace is\nbreakfast enough for me.  I couldn't eat a morsel; it would choke me.\"\n\nMr. Gunnill eyed her over the rim of his teacup.  \"I come down an hour\nago,\" he said, casually, as he helped himself to some bacon.\n\nMiss Gunnill started despite herself.  \"Oh!\" she said, listlessly.\n\n\"And I see you making a very good breakfast all by yourself in the\nkitchen,\" continued her father, in a voice not free from the taint of\ntriumph.\n\nThe discomfited Selina rose and stood regarding him; Mr. Gunnill, after a\nvain attempt to meet her gaze, busied himself with his meal.\n\n\"The idea of watching every mouthful I eat!\"  said Miss Gunnill,\ntragically; \"the idea of complaining because I have some breakfast!  I'd\nnever have believed it of you, never!  It's shameful!  Fancy grudging\nyour own daughter the food she eats!\"\n\nMr. Gunnill eyed her in dismay.  In his confusion he had overestimated\nthe capacity of his mouth, and he now strove in vain to reply to this\nshameful perversion of his meaning.  His daughter stood watching him with\ngrief in one eye and calculation in the other, and, just as he had put\nhimself into a position to exercise his rights of free speech, gave a\npathetic sniff and walked out of the room.\n\nShe stayed indoors all day, but the necessity of establishing his\ninnocence took Mr. Gunnill out a great deal.  His neighbours, in the hope\nof further excitement, warmly pressed him to go to prison rather than pay\na fine, and instanced the example of an officer in the Salvation Army,\nwho, in very different circumstances, had elected to take that course.\nMr. Gunnill assured them that only his known antipathy to the army, and\nthe fear of being regarded as one of its followers, prevented him from\ndoing so.  He paid instead a fine of ten shillings, and after listening\nto a sermon, in which his silver hairs served as the text, was permitted\nto depart.  His feeling against Police-constable Cooper increased with\nthe passing of the days.  The constable watched him with the air of a\nproprietor, and Mrs. Cooper's remark that \"her husband had had his eye\nupon him for a long time, and that he had better be careful for the\nfuture,\" was faithfully retailed to him within half an hour of its\nutterance.  Convivial friends counted his cups for him; teetotal friends\nmore than hinted that Cooper was in the employ of his good angel.\n\nMiss Gunnill's two principal admirers had an arduous task to perform.\nThey had to attribute Mr. Gunnill's disaster to the vindictiveness of\nCooper, and at the same time to agree with his daughter that it served\nhim right.  Between father and daughter they had a difficult time, Mr.\nGunnill's sensitiveness having been much heightened by his troubles.\n\n\"Cooper ought not to have taken you,\" said Herbert Sims for the fiftieth\ntime.\n\n\"He must ha' seen you like it dozens o' times before,\" said Ted Drill,\nwho, in his determination not to be outdone by Mr. Sims, was not\ndisplaying his usual judgment.  \"Why didn't he take you then?  That's\nwhat you ought to have asked the magistrate.\"\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" said Mr. Gunnill, with an air of cold dignity.\n\n\"Why,\" said Mr. Drill, \"what I mean is--look at that night, for instance,\nwhen----\"\n\nHe broke off suddenly, even his enthusiasm not being proof against the\nextraordinary contortions of visage in which Mr. Gunnill was indulging.\n\n\"When?\"  prompted Selina and Mr. Sims together.  Mr. Gunnill, after first\ndaring him with his eye, followed suit.\n\n\"That night at the Crown,\" said Mr. Drill, awkwardly.  \"You know; when\nyou thought that Joe Baggs was the landlord.  You tell 'em; you tell it\nbest.  I've roared over it.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you're driving at,\" said the harassed Mr. Gunnill,\nbitterly.\n\n\"H'm!\"  said Mr. Drill, with a weak laugh.  \"I've been mixing you up with\nsomebody else.\"\n\nMr. Gunnill, obviously relieved, said that he ought to be more careful,\nand pointed out, with some feeling, that a lot of mischief was caused\nthat way.\n\n\"Cooper wants a lesson, that's what he wants,\" said Mr. Sims, valiantly.\n\"He'll get his head broke one of these days.\"\n\nMr. Gunnill acquiesced.  \"I remember when I was on the _Peewit,_\" he\nsaid, musingly, \"one time when we were lying at Cardiff, there was a\npoliceman there run one of our chaps in, and two nights afterward another\nof our chaps pushed the policeman down in the mud and ran off with his\nstaff and his helmet.\"\n\nMiss Gunnill's eyes glistened.  \"What happened?\" she inquired.\n\n\"He had to leave the force,\" replied her father; \"he couldn't stand the\ndisgrace of it.  The chap that pushed him over was quite a little chap,\ntoo.  About the size of Herbert here.\"\n\nMr. Sims started.\n\n\"Very much like him in face, too,\" pursued Mr. Gunnill; \"daring chap he\nwas.\"\n\nMiss Gunnill sighed.  \"I wish he lived in Little-stow,\" she said, slowly.\n\"I'd give anything to take that horrid Mrs. Cooper down a bit.  Cooper\nwould be the laughing-stock of the town.\"\n\nMessrs. Sims and Drill looked unhappy.  It was hard to have to affect an\nattitude of indifference in the face of Miss Gunnill's lawless yearnings;\nto stand before her as respectable and law-abiding cravens.  Her eyes,\nlarge and sorrowful; dwelt on them both.\n\n\"If I--I only get a chance at Cooper!\" murmured Mr. Sims, vaguely.\n\nTo his surprise, Mr. Gunnill started up from his chair and, gripping his\nhand, shook it fervently.  He looked round, and Selina was regarding him\nwith a glance so tender that he lost his head completely.  Before he had\nrecovered he had pledged himself to lay the helmet and truncheon of the\nredoubtable Mr. Cooper at the feet of Miss Gunnill; exact date not\nspecified.\n\n\"Of course, I shall have to wait my opportunity,\" he said, at last.\n\n\"You wait as long as you like, my boy,\" said the thoughtless Mr. Gunnill.\n\nMr. Sims thanked him.\n\n\"Wait till Cooper's an old man,\" urged Mr. Drill.\n\nMiss Gunnill, secretly disappointed at the lack of boldness and devotion\non the part of the latter gentleman, eyed his stalwart frame indignantly\nand accused him of trying to make Mr. Sims as timid as himself.  She\nturned to the valiant Sims and made herself so agreeable to that daring\nblade that Mr. Drill, a prey to violent jealousy, bade the company a curt\ngood-night and withdrew.\n\nHe stayed away for nearly a week, and then one evening as he approached\nthe house, carrying a carpet-bag, he saw the door just opening to admit\nthe fortunate Herbert.  He quickened his pace and arrived just in time to\nfollow him in.  Mr. Sims, who bore under his arm a brown-paper parcel,\nseemed somewhat embarrassed at seeing him, and after a brief greeting\nwalked into the room, and with a triumphant glance at Mr. Gunnill and\nSelina placed his burden on the table.\n\n\"You--you ain't got it?\"  said Mr. Gunnill, leaning forward.\n\n\"How foolish of you to run such a risk!\"  said Selina.\n\n\"I brought it for Miss Gunnill,\" said the young man, simply.  He\nunfastened the parcel, and to the astonishment of all present revealed a\npoliceman's helmet and a short boxwood truncheon.\n\n\"You--you're a wonder,\" said the gloating Mr. Gunnill.  \"Look at it,\nTed!\"\n\nMr. Drill was looking at it; it may be doubted whether the head of Mr.\nCooper itself could have caused him more astonishment.  Then his eyes\nsought those of Mr. Sims, but that gentleman was gazing tenderly at the\ngratified but shocked Selina.\n\n\"How ever did you do it?\"  inquired Mr. Gunnill.\n\n\"Came behind him and threw him down,\" said Mr. Sims, nonchalantly.  \"He\nwas that scared I believe I could have taken his boots as well if I'd\nwanted them.\"\n\nMr. Gunnill patted him on the back.  \"I fancy I can see him running\nbare-headed through the town calling for help,\" he said, smiling.\n\nMr. Sims shook his head.  \"Like as not it'll be kept quiet for the credit\nof the force,\" he said, slowly, \"unless, of course, they discover who did\nit.\"\n\nA slight shade fell on the good-humoured countenance of Mr. Gunnill, but\nit was chased away almost immediately by Sims reminding him of the chaff\nof Cooper's brother-constables.\n\n\"And you might take the others away,\" said Mr. Gunnill, brightening; \"you\nmight keep on doing it.\"\n\nMr. Sims said doubtfully that he might, but pointed out that Cooper would\nprobably be on his guard for the future.\n\n\"Yes, you've done your share,\" said Miss Gunnill, with a half-glance at\nMr. Drill, who was still gazing in a bewildered fashion at the trophies.\n\"You can come into the kitchen and help me draw some beer if you like.\"\n\nMr. Sims followed her joyfully, and reaching down a jug for her watched\nher tenderly as she drew the beer.  All women love valour, but Miss\nGunnill, gazing sadly at the slight figure of Mr. Sims, could not help\nwishing that Mr. Drill possessed a little of his spirit.\n\nShe had just finished her task when a tremendous bumping noise was heard\nin the living-room, and the plates on the dresser were nearly shaken off\ntheir shelves.\n\n\"What's that?\" she cried.\n\nThey ran to the room and stood aghast in the doorway at the spectacle of\nMr. Gunnill, with his clenched fists held tightly by his side, bounding\ninto the air with all the grace of a trained acrobat, while Mr. Drill\nencouraged him from an easy-chair.  Mr. Gunnill smiled broadly as he met\ntheir astonished gaze, and with a final bound kicked something along the\nfloor and subsided into his seat panting.\n\nMr. Sims, suddenly enlightened, uttered a cry of dismay and, darting\nunder the table, picked up what had once been a policeman's helmet.  Then\nhe snatched a partially consumed truncheon from the fire, and stood white\nand trembling before the astonished Mr. Gunnill.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" inquired the latter.  \"You--you've spoilt 'em,\"\ngasped Mr. Sims.  \"What of it?\"  said Mr. Gunnill, staring.\n\n\"I was--going to take 'em away,\" stammered Mr. Sims.\n\n\"Well, they'll be easier to carry now,\" said Mr. Drill, simply.\n\nMr. Sims glanced at him sharply, and then, to the extreme astonishment of\nMr. Gunnill, snatched up the relics and, wrapping them up in the paper,\ndashed out of the house.  Mr. Gunnill turned a look of blank inquiry upon\nMr. Drill.\n\n\"It wasn't Cooper's number on the helmet,\" said that gentleman.\n\n\"Eh?\" shouted Mr. Gunnill.\n\n\"How do you know?\" inquired Selina.\n\n\"I just happened to notice,\" replied Mr. Drill.  He reached down as\nthough to take up the carpet-bag which he had placed by the side of his\nchair, and then, apparently thinking better of it, leaned back in his\nseat and eyed Mr. Gunnill.\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me,\" said the latter, \"that he's been and upset the\nwrong man?\"\n\nMr. Drill shook his head.  \"That's the puzzle,\" he said, softly.\n\nHe smiled over at Miss Gunnill, but that young lady, who found him\nsomewhat mysterious, looked away and frowned.  Her father sat and\nexhausted conjecture, his final conclusion being that Mr. Sims had\nattacked the first policeman that had come in his way and was now\nsuffering the agonies of remorse.\n\nHe raised his head sharply at the sound of hurried footsteps outside.\nThere was a smart rap at the street door, then the handle was turned, and\nthe next moment, to the dismay of all present, the red and angry face of\none of Mr. Cooper's brother-constables was thrust into the room.\n\nMr. Gunnill gazed at it in helpless fascination.  The body of the\nconstable garbed in plain clothes followed the face and, standing before\nhim in a menacing fashion, held out a broken helmet and staff.\n\n\"Have you seen these afore?\" he inquired, in a terrible voice.\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Gunnill, with an attempt at surprise.  \"What are they?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what they are,\" said Police-constable Jenkins,\nferociously; \"they're my helmet and truncheon.  You've been spoiling His\nMajesty's property, and you'll be locked up.\"\n\n\"Yours?\" said the astonished Mr. Gunnill.\n\n\"I lent 'em to young Sims, just for a joke,\" said the constable.  \"I felt\nall along I was doing a silly thing.\"\n\n\"It's no joke,\" said Mr. Gunnill, severely.  \"I'll tell young Herbert\nwhat I think of him trying to deceive me like that.\"\n\n\"Never mind about deceiving,\" interrupted the constable.  \"What are you\ngoing to do about it?\"\n\n\"What are you?\"  inquired Mr. Gunnill, hardily.  \"It seems to me it's\nbetween you and him; you'll very likely be dismissed from the force, and\nall through trying to deceive.  I wash my hands of it.\"\n\n\"You'd no business to lend it,\" said Drill, interrupting the constable's\nindignant retort; \"especially for Sims to pretend that he had stolen it\nfrom Cooper.  It's a roundabout sort of thing, but you can't tell of Mr.\nGunnill without getting into trouble yourself.\"\n\n\"I shall have to put up with that,\" said the constable, desperately;\n\"it's got to be explained.  It's my day-helmet, too, and the night one's\nas shabby as can be.  Twenty years in the force and never a mark against\nmy name till now.\"\n\n\"If you'd only keep quiet a bit instead of talking so much,\" said Mr.\nDrill, who had been doing some hard thinking, \"I might be able to help\nyou, p'r'aps.\"\n\n\"How?\" inquired the constable.\n\n\"Help him if you can, Ted,\" said Mr. Gunnill, eagerly; \"we ought all to\nhelp others when we get a chance.\"\n\nMr. Drill sat bolt upright and looked very wise.\n\nHe took the smashed helmet from the table and examined it carefully.  It\nwas broken in at least half-a-dozen places, and he laboured in vain to\npush it into shape.  He might as well have tried to make a silk hat out\nof a concertina.  The only thing that had escaped injury was the metal\nplate with the number.\n\n\"Why don't you mend it?\"  he inquired, at last.\n\n\"Mend it?\" shouted the incensed Mr. Jenkins.  \"Why don't you?\"\n\n\"I think I could,\" said Mr. Drill, slowly; \"give me half an hour in the\nkitchen and I'll try.\"\n\n\"Have as long as you like,\" said Mr. Gunnill.\n\n\"And I shall want some glue, and Miss Gunnill, and some tin-tacks,\" said\nDrill.\n\n\"What do you want me for?\" inquired Selina.\n\n\"To hold the things for me,\" replied Mr. Drill.\n\nMiss Gunnill tossed her head, but after a little demur consented; and\nDrill, ignoring the impatience of the constable, picked up his bag and\nled the way into the kitchen.  Messrs. Gunnill and Jenkins, left behind\nin the living-room, sought for some neutral topic of discourse, but in\nvain; conversation would revolve round hard labour and lost pensions.\nFrom the kitchen came sounds of hammering, then a loud \"Ooh!\" from Miss\nGunnill, followed by a burst of laughter and a clapping of hands.  Mr.\nJenkins shifted in his seat and exchanged glances with Mr. Gunnill.\n\n\"He's a clever fellow,\" said that gentleman, hopefully.  \"You should hear\nhim imitate a canary; life-like it is.\"\n\nMr. Jenkins was about to make a hasty and obvious rejoinder, when the\nkitchen door opened and Selina emerged, followed by Drill.  The snarl\nwhich the constable had prepared died away in a murmur of astonishment as\nhe took the helmet.  It looked as good as ever.\n\nHe turned it over and over in amaze, and looked in vain for any signs of\nthe disastrous cracks.  It was stiff and upright.  He looked at the\nnumber: it was his own.  His eyes round with astonishment he tried it on,\nand then his face relaxed.\n\n\"It don't fit as well as it did,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, upon my word, some people are never satisfied,\" said the indignant\nDrill.  \"There isn't another man in England could have done it better.\"\n\n\"I'm not grumbling,\" said the constable, hastily; \"it's a wonderful piece\no' work.  Wonderful!  I can't even see where it was broke.  How on earth\ndid you do it?\"\n\nDrill shook his head.  \"It's a secret process,\" he said, slowly.  \"I\nmight want to go into the hat trade some day, and I'm not going to give\nthings away.\"\n\n\"Quite right,\" said Mr. Jenkins.  \"Still--well, it's a marvel, that's\nwhat it is; a fair marvel.  If you take my advice you'll go in the hat\ntrade to-morrow, my lad.\"\n\n\"I'm not surprised,\" said Mr. Gunnill, whose face as he spoke was a map\nof astonishment.  \"Not a bit.  I've seen him do more surprising things\nthan that.  Have a go at the staff now, Teddy.\"\n\n\"I'll see about it,\" said Mr. Drill, modestly.  \"I can't do\nimpossibilities.  You leave it here, Mr. Jenkins, and we'll talk about it\nlater on.\"\n\nMr. Jenkins, still marvelling over his helmet, assented, and, after\nanother reference to the possibilities in the hat trade to a man with a\nborn gift for repairs, wrapped his property in a piece of newspaper and\ndeparted, whistling.\n\n\"Ted,\" said Mr. Gunnill, impressively, as he sank into his chair with a\nsigh of relief.  \"How you done it I don't know.  It's a surprise even to\nme.\"\n\n\"He is very clever,\" said Selina, with a kind smile\n\nMr. Drill turned pale, and then, somewhat emboldened by praise from such\na quarter, dropped into a chair by her side and began to talk in low\ntones.  The grateful Mr. Gunnill, more relieved than he cared to confess,\nthoughtfully closed his eyes.\n\n\"I didn't think all along that you'd let Herbert outdo you,\" said Selina.\n\n\"I want to outdo him,\" said Mr. Drill, in a voice of much meaning.\n\nMiss Gunnill cast down her eyes and Mr. Drill had just plucked up\nsufficient courage to take her hand when footsteps stopped at the house,\nthe handle of the door was turned, and, for the second time that evening,\nthe inflamed visage of Mr. Jenkins confronted the company.\n\n\"Don't tell me it's a failure,\" said Mr. Gunnill, starting from his\nchair.  \"You must have been handling it roughly.  It was as good as new\nwhen you took it away.\"\n\nMr. Jenkins waved him away and fixed his eyes upon Drill.\n\n\"You think you're mighty clever, I dare say,\" he said, grimly; \"but I can\nput two and two together.  I've just heard of it.\"\n\n\"Heard of two and two?\" said Drill, looking puzzled.\n\n\"I don't want any of your nonsense,\" said Mr. Jenkins.  \"I'm not on duty\nnow, but I warn you not to say anything that may be used against you.\"\n\n\"I never do,\" said Mr. Drill, piously.\n\n\"Somebody threw a handful o' flour in poor Cooper's face a couple of\nhours ago,\" said Mr. Jenkins, watching him closely, \"and while he was\ngetting it out of his eyes they upset him and made off with his helmet\nand truncheon.  I just met Brown and he says Cooper's been going on like\na madman.\"\n\n\"By Jove! it's a good job I mended your helmet for you,\" said Mr. Drill,\n\"or else they might have suspected you.\"\n\nMr. Jenkins stared at him.  \"I know who did do it,\" he said,\nsignificantly.\n\n\"Herbert Sims?\" guessed Mr. Drill, in a stage whisper.\n\n\"You'll be one o' the first to know,\" said Mr. Jenkins, darkly; \"he'll be\narrested to-morrow.  Fancy the impudence of it!  It's shocking.\"\n\nMr. Drill whistled.  \"Nell, don't let that little affair o' yours with\nSims be known,\" he said, quietly.  \"Have that kept quiet--if you can.\"\n\nMr. Jenkins started as though he had been stung.  In the joy of a case he\nhad overlooked one or two things.  He turned and regarded the young man\nwistfully.\n\n\"Don't call on me as a witness, that's all,\" continued Mr. Drill.  \"I\nnever was a mischief-maker, and I shouldn't like to have to tell how you\nlent your helmet to Sims so that he could pretend he had knocked Cooper\ndown and taken it from him.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't look at all well,\" said Mr. Gunnill, nodding his head sagely.\n\nMr. Jenkins breathed hard and looked from one to the other.  It was plain\nthat it was no good reminding them that he had not had a case for five\nyears.\n\n\"When I say that I know who did it,\" he said, slowly, \"I mean that I have\nmy suspicions.\"\n\n\"Don't call on me as a witness, that's all,' continued Mr. Drill.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Mr. Drill, \"that's a very different thing.\"\n\n\"Nothing like the same,\" said Mr. Gunnill, pouring the constable a glass\nof ale.\n\nMr. Jenkins drank it and smacked his lips feebly.\n\n\"Sims needn't know anything about that helmet being repaired,\" he said at\nlast.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said everybody.\n\nMr. Jenkins sighed and turned to Drill.\n\n\"It's no good spoiling the ship for a ha'porth o' tar,\" he said, with a\nfaint suspicion of a wink.  \"No,\" said Drill, looking puzzled.\n\n\"Anything that's worth doing at all is worth doing well,\" continued the\nconstable, \"and while I'm drinking another glass with Mr. Gunnill here,\nsuppose you go into the kitchen with that useful bag o' yours and finish\nrepairing my truncheon?\"",
