    "body": "Twenty-one years ago in this house I heard a voice calling me to ascend\nthe platform, and there to stand and deliver. The voice was the voice of\nPresident North; the language was an excellent imitation of that used by\nCicero and Julius Caesar. I remember the flattering invitation--it is the\nclassic tag that clings to the graduate long after he has forgotten the\ngender of the nouns that end in 'um--orator proximus', the grateful voice\nsaid, 'ascendat, videlicet,' and so forth. To be proclaimed an orator,\nand an ascending orator, in such a sonorous tongue, in the face of a\nworld waiting for orators, stirred one's blood like the herald's trumpet\nwhen the lists are thrown open. Alas! for most of us, who crowded so\neagerly into the arena, it was the last appearance as orators on any\nstage.\n\nThe facility of the world for swallowing up orators, and company after\ncompany of educated young men, has been remarked. But it is almost\nincredible to me now that the class of 1851, with its classic sympathies\nand its many revolutionary ideas, disappeared in the flood of the world\nso soon and so silently, causing scarcely a ripple in the smoothly\nflowing stream. I suppose the phenomenon has been repeated for twenty\nyears. Do the young gentlemen at Hamilton, I wonder, still carry on their\nordinary conversation in the Latin tongue, and their familiar vacation\ncorrespondence in the language of Aristophanes? I hope so. I hope they\nare more proficient in such exercises than the young gentlemen of twenty\nyears ago were, for I have still great faith in a culture that is so far\nfrom any sordid aspirations as to approach the ideal; although the young\ngraduate is not long in learning that there is an indifference in the\npublic mind with regard to the first aorist that amounts nearly to\napathy, and that millions of his fellow-creatures will probably live and\ndie without the consolations of the second aorist. It is a melancholy\nfact that, after a thousand years of missionary effort, the vast majority\nof civilized men do not know that gerunds are found only in the singular\nnumber.\n\nI confess that this failure of the annual graduating class to make its\nexpected impression on the world has its pathetic side. Youth is\ncredulous--as it always ought to be--and full of hope--else the world\nwere dead already--and the graduate steps out into life with an ingenuous\nself-confidence in his resources. It is to him an event, this\nturning-point in the career of what he feels to be an important and\nimmortal being. His entrance is public and with some dignity of display.\nFor a day the world stops to see it; the newspapers spread abroad a\nreport of it, and the modest scholar feels that the eyes of mankind are\nfixed on him in expectation and desire. Though modest, he is not\ninsensible to the responsibility of his position. He has only packed away\nin his mind the wisdom of the ages, and he does not intend to be stingy\nabout communicating it to the world which is awaiting his graduation.\nFresh from the communion with great thoughts in great literatures, he is\nin haste to give mankind the benefit of them, and lead it on into new\nenthusiasm and new conquests.\n\nThe world, however, is not very much excited. The birth of a child is in\nitself marvelous, but it is so common. Over and over again, for hundreds\nof years, these young gentlemen have been coming forward with their\nspecimens of learning, tied up in neat little parcels, all ready to\nadminister, and warranted to be of the purest materials. The world is not\nunkind, it is not even indifferent, but it must be confessed that it does\nnot act any longer as if it expected to be enlightened. It is generally\nso busy that it does not even ask the young gentlemen what they can do,\nbut leaves them standing with their little parcels, wondering when the\nperson will pass by who requires one of them, and when there will happen\na little opening in the procession into which they can fall. They\nexpected that way would be made for them with shouts of welcome, but they\nfind themselves before long struggling to get even a standing-place in\nthe crowd--it is only kings, and the nobility, and those fortunates who\ndwell in the tropics, where bread grows on trees and clothing is\nunnecessary, who have reserved seats in this world.\n\nTo the majority of men I fancy that literature is very much the same that\nhistory is; and history is presented as a museum of antiquities and\ncuriosities, classified, arranged, and labeled. One may walk through it\nas he does through the Hotel de Cluny; he feels that he ought to be\ninterested in it, but it is very tiresome. Learning is regarded in like\nmanner as an accumulation of literature, gathered into great storehouses\ncalled libraries--the thought of which excites great respect in most\nminds, but is ineffably tedious. Year after year and age after age it\naccumulates--this evidence and monument of intellectual activity--piling\nitself up in vast collections, which it needs a lifetime even to\ncatalogue, and through which the uncultured walk as the idle do through\nthe British Museum, with no very strong indignation against Omar who\nburned the library at Alexandria.\n\nTo the popular mind this vast accumulation of learning in libraries, or\nin brains that do not visibly apply it, is much the same thing. The\nbusiness of the scholar appears to be this sort of accumulation; and the\nyoung student, who comes to the world with a little portion of this\ntreasure dug out of some classic tomb or mediaeval museum, is received\nwith little more enthusiasm than is the miraculous handkerchief of St.\nVeronica by the crowd of Protestants to whom it is exhibited on Holy Week\nin St. Peter's. The historian must make his museum live again; the\nscholar must vivify his learning with a present purpose.\n\nIt is unnecessary for me to say that all this is only from the\nunsympathetic and worldly side. I should think myself a criminal if I\nsaid anything to chill the enthusiasm of the young scholar, or to dash\nwith any skepticism his longing and his hope. He has chosen the highest.\nHis beautiful faith and his aspiration are the light of life. Without his\nfresh enthusiasm and his gallant devotion to learning, to art, to\nculture, the world would be dreary enough. Through him comes the\never-springing inspiration in affairs. Baffled at every turn and driven\ndefeated from a hundred fields, he carries victory in himself. He belongs\nto a great and immortal army. Let him not be discouraged at his apparent\nlittle influence, even though every sally of every young life may seem\nlike a forlorn hope. No man can see the whole of the battle. It must\nneeds be that regiment after regiment, trained, accomplished, gay, and\nhigh with hope, shall be sent into the field, marching on, into the\nsmoke, into the fire, and be swept away. The battle swallows them, one\nafter the other, and the foe is yet unyielding, and the ever-remorseless\ntrumpet calls for more and more. But not in vain, for some day, and every\nday, along the line, there is a cry, \"They fly! they fly!\" and the whole\narmy advances, and the flag is planted on an ancient fortress where it\nnever waved before. And, even if you never see this, better than\ninglorious camp-following is it to go in with the wasting regiment; to\ncarry the colors up the slope of the enemy's works, though the next\nmoment you fall and find a grave at the foot of the glacis.\n\nWhat are the relations of culture to common life, of the scholar to the\nday-laborer? What is the value of this vast accumulation of higher\nlearning, what is its point of contact with the mass of humanity, that\ntoils and eats and sleeps and reproduces itself and dies, generation\nafter generation, in an unvarying round, on an unvarying level? We have\nhad discussed lately the relation of culture to religion. Mr. Froude,\nwith a singular, reactionary ingenuity, has sought to prove that the\nprogress of the century, so-called, with all its material alleviations,\nhas done little in regard to a happy life, to the pleasure of existence,\nfor the average individual Englishman. Into neither of these inquiries do\nI purpose to enter; but we may not unprofitably turn our attention to a\nsubject closely connected with both of them.\n\nIt has not escaped your attention that there are indications everywhere\nof what may be called a ground-swell. There is not simply an inquiry as\nto the value of classic culture, a certain jealousy of the schools where\nit is obtained, a rough popular contempt for the graces of learning, a\nfailure to see any connection between the first aorist and the rolling of\nsteel rails, but there is arising an angry protest against the conditions\nof a life which make one free of the serene heights of thought and give\nhim range of all intellectual countries, and keep another at the spade\nand the loom, year after year, that he may earn food for the day and\nlodging for the night. In our day the demand here hinted at has taken\nmore definite form and determinate aim, and goes on, visible to all men,\nto unsettle society and change social and political relations. The great\nmovement of labor, extravagant and preposterous as are some of its\ndemands, demagogic as are most of its leaders, fantastic as are many of\nits theories, is nevertheless real, and gigantic, and full of a certain\nprimeval force, and with a certain justice in it that never sleeps in\nhuman affairs, but moves on, blindly often and destructively often, a\nmovement cruel at once and credulous, deceived and betrayed, and\nrevenging itself on friends and foes alike. Its strength is in the fact\nthat it is natural and human; it might have been predicted from a mere\nknowledge of human nature, which is always restless in any relations it\nis possible to establish, which is always like the sea, seeking a level,\nand never so discontented as when anything like a level is approximated.\n\nWhat is the relation of the scholar to the present phase of this\nmovement? What is the relation of culture to it? By scholar I mean the\nman who has had the advantages of such an institution as this. By culture\nI mean that fine product of opportunity and scholarship which is to mere\nknowledge what manners are to the gentleman. The world has a growing\nbelief in the profit of knowledge, of information, but it has a suspicion\nof culture. There is a lingering notion in matters religious that\nsomething is lost by refinement--at least, that there is danger that the\nplain, blunt, essential truths will be lost in aesthetic graces. The\nlaborer is getting to consent that his son shall go to school, and learn\nhow to build an undershot wheel or to assay metals; but why plant in his\nmind those principles of taste which will make him as sensitive to beauty\nas to pain, why open to him those realms of imagination with the\nillimitable horizons, the contours and colors of which can but fill him\nwith indefinite longing?\n\nIt is not necessary for me in this presence to dwell upon the value of\nculture. I wish rather to have you notice the gulf that exists between\nwhat the majority want to know and that fine fruit of knowledge\nconcerning which there is so widespread an infidelity. Will culture aid a\nminister in a \"protracted meeting\"? Will the ability to read Chaucer\nassist a shop-keeper? Will the politician add to the \"sweetness and\nlight\" of his lovely career if he can read the \"Battle of the Frogs and\nthe Mice\" in the original? What has the farmer to do with the \"Rose\nGarden of Saadi\"?\n\nI suppose it is not altogether the fault of the majority that the true\nrelation of culture to common life is so misunderstood. The scholar is\nlargely responsible for it; he is largely responsible for the isolation\nof his position, and the want of sympathy it begets. No man can influence\nhis fellows with any power who retires into his own selfishness, and\ngives himself to a self-culture which has no further object. What is he\nthat he should absorb the sweets of the universe, that he should hold all\nthe claims of humanity second to the perfecting of himself? This effort\nto save his own soul was common to Goethe and Francis of Assisi; under\ndifferent manifestations it was the same regard for self. And where it is\nan intellectual and not a spiritual greediness, I suppose it is what an\nold writer calls \"laying up treasures in hell.\"\n\nIt is not an unreasonable demand of the majority that the few who have\nthe advantages of the training of college and university should exhibit\nthe breadth and sweetness of a generous culture, and should shed\neverywhere that light which ennobles common things, and without which\nlife is like one of the old landscapes in which the artist forgot to put\nsunlight. One of the reasons why the college-bred man does not meet this\nreasonable expectation is that his training, too often, has not been\nthorough and conscientious, it has not been of himself; he has acquired,\nbut he is not educated. Another is that, if he is educated, he is not\nimpressed with the intimacy of his relation to that which is below him as\nwell as that which is above him, and his culture is out of sympathy with\nthe great mass that needs it, and must have it, or it will remain a blind\nforce in the world, the lever of demagogues who preach social anarchy and\nmisname it progress. There is no culture so high, no taste so fastidious,\nno grace of learning so delicate, no refinement of art so exquisite, that\nit cannot at this hour find full play for itself in the broadest fields\nof humanity; since it is all needed to soften the attritions of common\nlife, and guide to nobler aspirations the strong materialistic influences\nof our restless society.\n\nOne reason, as I said, for the gulf between the majority and the select\nfew to be educated is, that the college does not seldom disappoint the\nreasonable expectation concerning it. The graduate of the carpenter's\nshop knows how to use his tools--or used to in days before superficial\ntraining in trades became the rule. Does the college graduate know how to\nuse his tools? Or has he to set about fitting himself for some\nemployment, and gaining that culture, that training of himself, that\nutilization of his information which will make him necessary in the\nworld? There has been a great deal of discussion whether a boy should be\ntrained in the classics or mathematics or sciences or modern languages. I\nfeel like saying \"yes\" to all the various propositions. For Heaven's sake\ntrain him in something, so that he can handle himself, and have free and\nconfident use of his powers. There isn't a more helpless creature in the\nuniverse than a scholar with a vast amount of information over which he\nhas no control. He is like a man with a load of hay so badly put upon his\ncart that it all slides off before he can get to market. The influence of\na man on the world is generally proportioned to his ability to do\nsomething. When Abraham Lincoln was running for the Legislature the first\ntime, on the platform of the improvement of the navigation of the\nSangamon River, he went to secure the votes of thirty men who were\ncradling a wheat field. They asked no questions about internal\nimprovements, but only seemed curious whether Abraham had muscle enough\nto represent them in the Legislature. The obliging man took up a cradle\nand led the gang round the field. The whole thirty voted for him.\n\nWhat is scholarship? The learned Hindu can repeat I do not know how many\nthousands of lines from the Vedas, and perhaps backwards as well as\nforwards. I heard of an excellent old lady who had counted how many times\nthe letter A occurs in the Holy Scriptures. The Chinese students who\naspire to honors spend years in verbally memorizing the classics\n--Confucius and Mencius--and receive degrees and public advancement upon\nability to transcribe from memory without the error of a point, or\nmisplacement of a single tea-chest character, the whole of some books of\nmorals. You do not wonder that China is today more like an herbarium than\nanything else. Learning is a kind of fetish, and it has no influence\nwhatever upon the great inert mass of Chinese humanity.\n\nI suppose it is possible for a young gentleman to be able to read--just\nthink of it, after ten years of grammar and lexicon, not to know Greek\nliterature and have flexible command of all its richness and beauty, but\nto read it!--it is possible, I suppose, for the graduate of college to be\nable to read all the Greek authors, and yet to have gone, in regard to\nhis own culture, very little deeper than a surface reading of them; to\nknow very little of that perfect architecture and what it expressed; nor\nof that marvelous sculpture and the conditions of its immortal beauty;\nnor of that artistic development which made the Acropolis to bud and\nbloom under the blue sky like the final flower of a perfect nature; nor\nof that philosophy, that politics, that society, nor of the life of that\npolished, crafty, joyous race, the springs of it and the far-reaching,\nstill unexpended effects of it.\n\nYet as surely as that nothing perishes, that the Providence of God is not\na patchwork of uncontinued efforts, but a plan and a progress, as surely\nas the Pilgrim embarkation at Delfshaven has a relation to the battle of\nGettysburg, and to the civil rights bill giving the colored man\npermission to ride in a public conveyance and to be buried in a public\ncemetery, so surely has the Parthenon some connection with your new State\ncapitol at Albany, and the daily life of the vine-dresser of the\nPeloponnesus some lesson for the American day-laborer. The scholar is\nsaid to be the torch-bearer, transmitting the increasing light from\ngeneration to generation, so that the feet of all, the humblest and the\nloveliest, may walk in the radiance and not stumble. But he very often\ncarries a dark lantern.\n\nNot what is the use of Greek, of any culture in art or literature, but\nwhat is the good to me of your knowing Greek, is the latest question of\nthe ditch-digger to the scholar--what better off am I for your learning?\nAnd the question, in view of the interdependence of all members of\nsociety, is one that cannot be put away as idle. One reason why the\nscholar does not make the world of the past, the world of books, real to\nhis fellows and serviceable to them, is that it is not real to himself,\nbut a mere unsubstantial place of intellectual idleness, where he dallies\nsome years before he begins his task in life. And another reason is that,\nwhile it may be real to him, while he is actually cultured and trained,\nhe fails to see or to feel that his culture is not a thing apart, and\nthat all the world has a right to share its blessed influence. Failing to\nsee this, he is isolated, and, wanting his sympathy, the untutored world\nmocks at his super-fineness and takes its own rough way to rougher ends.\nGreek art was for the people, Greek poetry was for the people; Raphael\npainted his immortal frescoes where throngs could be lifted in thought\nand feeling by them; Michael Angelo hung the dome over St. Peter's so\nthat the far-off peasant on the Campagna could see it, and the maiden\nkneeling by the shrine in the Alban hills. Do we often stop to think what\ninfluence, direct or other, the scholar, the man of high culture, has\ntoday upon the great mass of our people? Why do they ask, what is the use\nof your learning and your art?\n\nThe artist, in the retirement of his studio, finishes a charming,\nsuggestive, historical picture. The rich man buys it and hangs it in his\nlibrary, where the privileged few can see it. I do not deny that the\naverage rich man needs all the refining influence the picture can exert\non him, and that the picture is doing missionary work in his house; but\nit is nevertheless an example of an educating influence withdrawn and\nappropriated to narrow uses. But the engraver comes, and, by his\nmediating art, transfers it to a thousand sheets, and scatters its sweet\ninfluence far abroad. All the world, in its toil, its hunger, its\nsordidness, pauses a moment to look on it--that gray seacoast, the\nreceding Mayflower, the two young Pilgrims in the foreground regarding\nit, with tender thoughts of the far home--all the world looks on it\nperhaps for a moment thoughtfully, perhaps tearfully, and is touched with\nthe sentiment of it, is kindled into a glow of nobleness by the sight of\nthat faith and love and resolute devotion which have tinged our early\nhistory with the faint light of romance. So art is no longer the\nenjoyment of the few, but the help and solace of the many.\n\nThe scholar who is cultured by books, reflection, travel, by a refined\nsociety, consorts with his kind, and more and more removes himself from\nthe sympathies of common life. I know how almost inevitable this is, how\nalmost impossible it is to resist the segregation of classes according to\nthe affinities of taste. But by what mediation shall the culture that is\nnow the possession of the few be made to leaven the world and to elevate\nand sweeten ordinary life? By books? Yes. By the newspaper? Yes. By the\ndiffusion of works of art? Yes. But when all is done that can be done by\nsuch letters-missive from one class to another, there remains the need of\nmore personal contact, of a human sympathy, diffused and living. The\nworld has had enough of charities. It wants respect and consideration. We\ndesire no longer to be legislated for, it says; we want to be legislated\nwith. Why do you never come to see me but you bring me something? asks\nthe sensitive and poor seamstress. Do you always give some charity to\nyour friends? I want companionship, and not cold pieces; I want to be\ntreated like a human being who has nerves and feelings, and tears too,\nand as much interest in the sunset, and in the birth of Christ, perhaps\nas you. And the mass of uncared-for ignorance and brutality, finding a\nvoice at length, bitterly repels the condescensions of charity; you have\nyour culture, your libraries, your fine houses, your church, your\nreligion, and your God, too; let us alone, we want none of them. In the\nbear-pit at Berne, the occupants, who are the wards of the city, have had\nmeat thrown to them daily for I know not how long, but they are not tamed\nby this charity, and would probably eat up any careless person who fell\ninto their clutches, without apology.\n\nDo not impute to me quixotic notions with regard to the duties of men and\nwomen of culture, or think that I undervalue the difficulties in the way,\nthe fastidiousness on the one side, or the jealousies on the other. It is\nby no means easy to an active participant to define the drift of his own\nage; but I seem to see plainly that unless the culture of the age finds\nmeans to diffuse itself, working downward and reconciling antagonisms by\na commonness of thought and feeling and aim in life, society must more\nand more separate itself into jarring classes, with mutual\nmisunderstandings and hatred and war. To suggest remedies is much more\ndifficult than to see evils; but the comprehension of dangers is the\nfirst step towards mastering them. The problem of our own time--the\nreconciliation of the interests of classes--is as yet very ill defined.\nThis great movement of labor, for instance, does not know definitely what\nit wants, and those who are spectators do not know what their relations\nare to it. The first thing to be done is for them to try to understand\neach other. One class sees that the other has lighter or at least\ndifferent labor, opportunities of travel, a more liberal supply of the\nluxuries of life, a higher enjoyment and a keener relish of the\nbeautiful, the immaterial. Looking only at external conditions, it\nconcludes that all it needs to come into this better place is wealth, and\nso it organizes war upon the rich, and it makes demands of freedom from\ntoil and of compensation which it is in no man's power to give it, and\nwhich would not, if granted over and over again, lift it into that\ncondition it desires. It is a tale in the Gulistan, that a king placed\nhis son with a preceptor, and said, \"This is your son; educate him in the\nsame manner as your own.\" The preceptor took pains with him for a year,\nbut without success, whilst his own sons were completed in learning and\naccomplishments. The king reproved the preceptor, and said, \"You have\nbroken your promise, and not acted faithfully.\"\n\nHe replied, \"O king, the education was the same, but the capacities are\ndifferent. Although silver and gold are produced from a stone, yet these\nmetals are not to be found in every stone. The star Canopus shines all\nover the world, but the scented leather comes only from Yemen.\" \"'Tis an\nabsolute, and, as it were, a divine perfection,\" says Montaigne, \"for a\nman to know how loyally to enjoy his being. We seek other conditions, by\nreason we do not understand the use of our own; and go out of ourselves,\nbecause we know not how there to reside.\"\n\nBut nevertheless it becomes a necessity for us to understand the wishes\nof those who demand a change of condition, and it is necessary that they\nshould understand the compensations as well as the limitations of every\ncondition. The dervish congratulated himself that although the only\nmonument of his grave would be a brick, he should at the last day arrive\nat and enter the gate of Paradise before the king had got from under the\nheavy stones of his costly tomb. Nothing will bring us into this\ndesirable mutual understanding except sympathy and personal contact. Laws\nwill not do it; institutions of charity and relief will not do it.\n\nWe must believe, for one thing, that the graces of culture will not be\nthrown away if exercised among the humblest and the least cultured; it is\nfound out that flowers are often more welcome in the squalid\ntenement-houses of Boston than loaves of bread. It is difficult to say\nexactly how culture can extend its influence into places uncongenial and\nto people indifferent to it, but I will try and illustrate what I mean by\nan example or two.\n\nCriminals in this country, when the law took hold of them, used to be\nturned over to the care of men who often had more sympathy with the crime\nthan with the criminal, or at least to those who were almost as coarse in\nfeeling and as brutal in speech as their charges. There have been some\nchanges of late years in the care of criminals, but does public opinion\nyet everywhere demand that jailers and prison-keepers and executioners of\nthe penal law should be men of refinement, of high character, of any\ndegree of culture? I do not know any class more needing the best direct\npersonal influence of the best civilization than the criminal. The\nproblem of its proper treatment and reformation is one of the most\npressing, and it needs practically the aid of our best men and women. I\nshould have great hope of any prison establishment at the head of which\nwas a gentleman of fine education, the purest tastes, the most elevated\nmorality and lively sympathy with men as such, provided he had also will\nand the power of command. I do not know what might not be done for the\nviciously inclined and the transgressors, if they could come under the\ninfluence of refined men and women. And yet you know that a boy or a girl\nmay be arrested for crime, and pass from officer to keeper, and jailer to\nwarden, and spend years in a career of vice and imprisonment, and never\nonce see any man or woman, officially, who has tastes, or sympathies, or\naspirations much above that vulgar level whence the criminals came.\nAnybody who is honest and vigilant is considered good enough to take\ncharge of prison birds.\n\nThe age is merciful and abounds in charities-houses of refuge for poor\nwomen, societies for the conservation of the exposed and the reclamation\nof the lost. It is willing to pay liberally for their support, and to\nhire ministers and distributors of its benefactions. But it is beginning\nto see that it cannot hire the distribution of love, nor buy brotherly\nfeeling. The most encouraging thing I have seen lately is an experiment\nin one of our cities. In the thick of the town the ladies of the city\nhave furnished and opened a reading-room, sewing-room, conversation-room,\nor what not, where young girls, who work for a living and have no\nopportunity for any culture, at home or elsewhere, may spend their\nevenings. They meet there always some of the ladies I have spoken of,\nwhose unostentatious duty and pleasure it is to pass the evening with\nthem, in reading or music or the use of the needle, and the exchange of\nthe courtesies of life in conversation. Whatever grace and kindness and\nrefinement of manner they carry there, I do not suppose are wasted. These\nare some of the ways in which culture can serve men. And I take it that\none of the chief evidences of our progress in this century is the\nrecognition of the truth that there is no selfishness so supreme--not\neven that in the possession of wealth--as that which retires into itself\nwith all the accomplishments of liberal learning and rare opportunities,\nand looks upon the intellectual poverty of the world without a wish to\nrelieve it. \"As often as I have been among men,\" says Seneca, \"I have\nreturned less a man.\" And Thomas a Kempis declared that \"the greatest\nsaints avoided the company of men as much as they could, and chose to\nlive to God in secret.\" The Christian philosophy was no improvement upon\nthe pagan in this respect, and was exactly at variance with the teaching\nand practice of Jesus of Nazareth.\n\nThe American scholar cannot afford to live for himself, nor merely for\nscholarship and the delights of learning. He must make himself more felt\nin the material life of this country. I am aware that it is said that the\nculture of the age is itself materialistic, and that its refinements are\nsensual; that there is little to choose between the coarse excesses of\npoverty and the polished and more decorous animality of the more\nfortunate. Without entering directly upon the consideration of this\nmuch-talked-of tendency, I should like to notice the influence upon our\npresent and probable future of the bounty, fertility, and extraordinary\nopportunities of this still new land.\n\nThe American grows and develops himself with few restraints. Foreigners\nused to describe him as a lean, hungry, nervous animal, gaunt,\ninquisitive, inventive, restless, and certain to shrivel into physical\ninferiority in his dry and highly oxygenated atmosphere. This\napprehension is not well founded. It is quieted by his achievements the\ncontinent over, his virile enterprises, his endurance in war and in the\nmost difficult explorations, his resistance of the influence of great\ncities towards effeminacy and loss of physical vigor. If ever man took\nlarge and eager hold of earthly things and appropriated them to his own\nuse, it is the American. We are gross eaters, we are great drinkers. We\nshall excel the English when we have as long practice as they. I am\nfilled with a kind of dismay when I see the great stock-yards of Chicago\nand Cincinnati, through which flow the vast herds and droves of the\nprairies, marching straight down the throats of Eastern people. Thousands\nare always sowing and reaping and brewing and distilling, to slake the\nimmortal thirst of the country. We take, indeed, strong hold of the\nearth; we absorb its fatness. When Leicester entertained Elizabeth at\nKenilworth, the clock in the great tower was set perpetually at twelve,\nthe hour of feasting. It is always dinner-time in America. I do not know\nhow much land it takes to raise an average citizen, but I should say a\nquarter section. He spreads himself abroad, he riots in abundance; above\nall things he must have profusion, and he wants things that are solid and\nstrong. On the Sorrentine promontory, and on the island of Capri, the\nhardy husbandman and fisherman draws his subsistence from the sea and\nfrom a scant patch of ground. One may feast on a fish and a handful of\nolives. The dinner of the laborer is a dish of polenta, a few figs, some\ncheese, a glass of thin wine. His wants are few and easily supplied. He\nis not overfed, his diet is not stimulating; I should say that he would\npay little to the physician, that familiar of other countries whose\nfamily office is to counteract the effects of over-eating. He is\ntemperate, frugal, content, and apparently draws not more of his life\nfrom the earth or the sea than from the genial sky. He would never build\na Pacific Railway, nor write a hundred volumes of commentary on the\nScriptures; but he is an example of how little a man actually needs of\nthe gross products of the earth.\n\nI suppose that life was never fuller in certain ways than it is here in\nAmerica. If a civilization is judged by its wants, we are certainly\nhighly civilized. We cannot get land enough, nor clothes enough, nor\nhouses enough, nor food enough. A Bedouin tribe would fare sumptuously on\nwhat one American family consumes and wastes. The revenue required for\nthe wardrobe of one woman of fashion would suffice to convert the\ninhabitants of I know not how many square miles in Africa. It absorbs the\nincome of a province to bring up a baby. We riot in prodigality, we vie\nwith each other in material accumulation and expense. Our thoughts are\nmainly on how to increase the products of the world; and get them into\nour own possession.\n\nI think this gross material tendency is strong in America, and more\nlikely to get the mastery over the spiritual and the intellectual here\nthan elsewhere, because of our exhaustless resources. Let us not mistake\nthe nature of a real civilization, nor suppose we have it because we can\nconvert crude iron into the most delicate mechanism, or transport\nourselves sixty miles an hour, or even if we shall refine our carnal\ntastes so as to be satisfied at dinner with the tongues of ortolans and\nthe breasts of singing-birds.\n\nPlato banished the musicians from his feasts because he would not have\nthe charms of conversation interfered with. By comparison, music was to\nhim a sensuous enjoyment. In any society the ideal must be the banishment\nof the more sensuous; the refinement of it will only repeat the continued\nexperiment of history--the end of a civilization in a polished\nmaterialism, and its speedy fall from that into grossness.\n\nI am sure that the scholar, trained to \"plain living and high thinking,\"\nknows that the prosperous life consists in the culture of the man, and\nnot in the refinement and accumulation of the material. The word culture\nis often used to signify that dainty intellectualism which is merely a\nsensuous pampering of the mind, as distinguishable from the healthy\ntraining of the mind as is the education of the body in athletic\nexercises from the petting of it by luxurious baths and unguents. Culture\nis the blossom of knowledge, but it is a fruit blossom, the ornament of\nthe age but the seed of the future. The so-called culture, a mere\nfastidiousness of taste, is a barren flower.\n\nYou would expect spurious culture to stand aloof from common life, as it\ndoes, to extend its charities at the end of a pole, to make of religion a\nmere 'cultus,' to construct for its heaven a sort of Paris, where all the\ninhabitants dress becomingly, and where there are no Communists. Culture,\nlike fine manners, is not always the result of wealth or position. When\nmonseigneur the archbishop makes his rare tour through the Swiss\nmountains, the simple peasants do not crowd upon him with boorish\nimpudence, but strew his stony path with flowers, and receive him with\njoyous but modest sincerity. When the Russian prince made his landing in\nAmerica the determined staring of a bevy of accomplished American women\nnearly swept the young man off the deck of the vessel. One cannot but\nrespect that tremulous sensitiveness which caused the maiden lady to\nshrink from staring at the moon when she heard there was a man in it.\n\nThe materialistic drift of this age--that is, its devotion to material\ndevelopment--is frequently deplored. I suppose it is like all other ages\nin that respect, but there appears to be a more determined demand for\nchange of condition than ever before, and a deeper movement for\nequalization. Here in America this is, in great part, a movement for\nmerely physical or material equalization. The idea seems to be well-nigh\nuniversal that the millennium is to come by a great deal less work and a\ngreat deal more pay. It seems to me that the millennium is to come by an\ninfusion into all society of a truer culture, which is neither of poverty\nnor of wealth, but is the beautiful fruit of the development of the\nhigher part of man's nature.\n\nAnd the thought I wish to leave with you, as scholars and men who can\ncommand the best culture, is that it is all needed to shape and control\nthe strong growth of material development here, to guide the blind\ninstincts of the mass of men who are struggling for a freer place and a\nbreath of fresh air; that you cannot stand aloof in a class isolation;\nthat your power is in a personal sympathy with the humanity which is\nignorant but discontented; and that the question which the man with the\nspade asks about the use of your culture to him is a menace.",
