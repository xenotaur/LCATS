I found out, then, that I\nhad spent that awful night with a harmless box of rifles and a lot of\ninnocent cheese; but the news was too late to save me; imagination had\ndone its work, and my health was permanently shattered; neither Bermuda\nnor any other land can ever bring it back tome. This is my last trip; I\nam on my way home to die.",
