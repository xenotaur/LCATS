Stokes Company Publishers\n\nCopyright, 1905\n\n\nIn travelling about the world one collects a number of those trifles of\nall sorts, usually named \"curiosities,\" many of them worthless if it\nwere not for the memories they recall. The other day I was clearing out\na bureau before going abroad, and in one of the drawers I came across a\nhedgehog's foot, set in silver, and hung upon a tarnished silver chain.\nI picked it up in the Sahara, and here is its history.\n\n*****\n\nMohammed El Aid Ben Ali Tidjani, marabout of Tamacine, is a great man in\nthe Sahara Desert. His reputation for piety reaches as far as Tunis\nand Algiers, to the north of Africa, and to the uttermost parts of the\nSouthern Desert, even to the land of the Touaregs. He dwells in a sacred\nvillage of dried mud and brick, surrounded by a high wall, pierced with\nloopholes, and ornamented with gates made of palm wood, and covered with\nsheets of iron. In his mansion, above the entrance of which is written\n\"L'Entree de Sidi Laid,\" are clocks innumerable, musical boxes, tables,\nchairs, sofas, and even framed photographs. Negro servants bow before\nhim, wives, brothers, children, and obsequious hangers-on of various\nnationalities, black, bronze, and _cafe au lait_ in colour, offer him\nperpetual incense. Rich worshippers of the Prophet and the Prophet's\npriests send him presents from afar; camels laden with barley, donkeys\nstaggering beneath sacks of grain, ostrich plumes, silver ornaments,\nperfumes, red-eyed doves, gazelles whose tiny hoofs are decorated with\ngold-leaf or painted in bright colours. The tributes laid before the\ntomb of Cheikh Sidi El Hadj Ali ben Sidi El Hadj Aissa are, doubtless,\nhis perquisites as guardian of the saint. He dresses in silks of the\ntints of the autumn leaf, and carries in his mighty hand a staff hung\nwith apple-green ribbons. And his smile is as the smile of the rising\nsun in an oleograph.\n\nThis personage one day blessed the hedgehog's foot I at present possess,\nand endowed it solemnly with miraculous curative properties. It would\ncure, he declared, all the physical ills that can beset a woman. Then\nhe gave it into the hands of a great Agha, who was about to take a wife,\naccepted a tribute of dates, a grandfather's clock from Paris, and a\ngrinding organ of Barbary as a small acknowledgment of his generosity,\nand probably thought very little more about the matter.\n\nNow, in the course of time, it happened that the hedgehog's foot came\ninto the possession of a dancing-girl of Touggourt, called Halima. How\nHalima got hold of it I cannot say, nor does anyone in Touggourt exactly\nknow, so far as I am aware. But, alas! even Aghas are sometimes human,\nand play pitch and toss with magical things. As Grand Dukes who go to\ndisport themselves in Paris sometimes hie them incognito to the \"Cafe\nde la Sorciere,\" so do Aghas flit occasionally to Touggourt, and appear\nupon the high benches of the great dancing-house of the Ouled Nails in\nthe outskirts of the city. And Halima was young and beautiful. Her\neyes were large, and she wore a golden crown ornamented with very tall\nfeathers. And she danced the dance of the hands and the dance of the\nfainting fit with great perfection. And the wives of Aghas have to put\nup with a good deal. However it was, one evening Halima danced with the\nhedgehog's foot that had been blessed dangling from her jewelled girdle.\nAnd there was a great scandal in the city.\n\nFor in the four quarters of Touggourt, the quarter of the Jews, of the\nforeigners, of the freed negroes, and of the citizens proper, it was\nknown that the hedgehog's foot had been blessed and endowed with magical\npowers by the mighty marabout of Tamacine.\n\nHalima herself affirmed it, standing at the front door of her terraced\ndwelling in the court, while the other dancers gathered round, looking\nlike a troop of macaws in their feathers and their finery. With a brazen\npride she boasted that she possessed something worth more than uncut\nrubies, carpets from Bagdad, and silken petticoats sewn with sequins.\nAnd the Ouled Nails could not gainsay her. Indeed, they turned their\nhuge, kohl-tinted eyes upon the relic with envy, and stretched their\npainted hands towards it as if to a god in prayer. But Halima would let\nno one touch it, and presently, taking from her bosom her immense door\nkey, she retired to enshrine the foot in her box, studded with huge\nbrass nails, such as stands by each dancer's bed.\n\nAnd the scandal was very great in the city that such a precious thing\nshould be between the hands of an Ouled Nail, a girl of no repute, come\nthither in a palanquin on camel-back to earn her dowry, and who would\ndepart into the sands of the south, laden with the gold wrung from the\npockets of loose livers.\n\nOnly Ben-Abid smiled gently when he heard of the matter.\n\nBen-Abid belonged to the _Tribu des blancs_, and was the singer attached\nto the cafe of the smokers of the hashish. He it was who struck each\nevening a guitar made of goatskin backed by sand tortoise, and lifted up\nhis voice in the song \"Lalia\":\n\n   \"Ladham Pacha who has left the heart of his enemies\n      trembling--\n         O Lalia! O Lalia!\n   The love of women is no more sweet to me after thy love.\n\n   Thy hand is white, and thy bracelets are of the purest\n      silver--\n   And I, Ladham Pacha, love thee, without thought of\n      what will come.\n         O Lalia! O Lalia!\"\n\nThe assembled smokers breathed out under the black ceiling their deep\nrefrain of \"Wur-ra-Wurra!\" and Larbi, in his Zouave jacket and his\ntight, pleated skirt, threw back his small head, exposing his long brown\nthroat, and danced like a tired phantom in a dream.\n\nBen-Abid smiled, showing two rows of lustrous teeth.\n\n\"Should Halima fall ill, the foot will not avail to cure her,\" he\nmurmured. \"Ben Ali Tidjani's blessing could never rest on an Ouled\nNail, who, like a little viper of the sand, has stolen into the Agha's\nbosom, and filled his veins with subtle poison. She deems she has a\ntreasure; but let her beware: that which would protect a woman who\nwears the veil will do naught for a creature who shows her face to the\nstranger, and dances by night for the Zouaves and for the Spahis who\npatrol the dunes.\"\n\nAnd he struck his long fingers upon the goatskin of his instrument,\nwhile Kouidah, the boy who played upon the little glasses and shook the\ntambourine of reeds, slipped forth to tell in the city what Ben-Abid had\nspoken.\n\nHalima was enraged when she heard of it, more especially as there were\nfound many to believe Ben-Abid's words. She stood before her room upon\nthe terrace, where Zouaves were playing cards with the dancers in\nthe sun, and she cursed him in a shrill voice, calling him son of a\nscorpion, and requesting that Allah would send great troubles upon\nhis relations, even upon his aged grandmother. That the miraculous\nreputation of her treasure should be thus scouted, and herself insulted,\nvexed her to the soul.\n\n\"Let the son of a camel with a swollen tongue dare to come to me and\nrepeat what he has said!\" she cried. \"Let him come out from his lair in\nthe cafe of the hashish smokers, and, as Allah is great, I will spit\nin his face. The reviler of women! The son of a scorpion! Cursed be\nhis------\"\n\nAnd then once more she desired evil to the grandmother of Ben-Abid, and\nto all his family. And the Zouaves and the dancers laughed over their\ncard games. Indeed, the other dancers were merry, and not ill-pleased\nwith Ben-Abid's words. For even in the Sahara the women do not care that\none of them should be exalted above the rest.\n\nNow, in Touggourt gossip is carried from house to house, as the sand\ngrains are carried on the wind. Within an hour Ben-Abid heard that his\ngrandmother had been cursed, and himself called son of a scorpion, by\nHalima. Kouidah, the boy, ran on naked feet to tell him in the cafe of\nthe hashish smokers. When he heard he smiled.\n\n\"To-night I will go to the dancing-house, and speak with Halima,\" he\nmurmured. And then he plucked the guitar of goatskin that was ever in\nhis hands, and sang softly of the joys of Ladham Pacha, half closing his\neyes, and swaying his head from side to side.\n\nAnd Kouidah, the boy, ran back across the camel market to tell in the\ncourt of the dancers the words of Ben-Abid.\n\nThat night, when the nomads lit their brushwood fires in the market;\nwhen the Kabyle bakers, in their striped turbans and their close-fitting\njerseys of yellow and of red, ran to and fro bearing the trays of flat,\nnew-made loaves; when the dwarfs beat on the ground with their staffs to\nsummon the mob to watch their antics; and the story-tellers put on their\nglasses, and sat them down at their boards between the candles; Ben-Abid\nwent forth secretly from the hashish cafe wrapped in his burnous. He\nsought out in the quarter of the freed negroes a certain man called\nSadok, who dwelt alone.\n\nThis Sadok was lean as a spectre, and had a skin like parchment. He was\na renowned plunger in desert wells, and could remain beneath the water,\nmen said, for a space of four minutes. But he could also do another\nthing. He could eat scorpions. And this he would do for a small sum\nof money. Only, during the fast of Ramadan, between the rising and the\ngoing down of the sun, so long as a white thread could be distinguished\nfrom a black, he would not eat even a scorpion, because the tasting of\nfood by day in that time is forbidden by the Prophet.\n\nWhen Ben-Abid struck on his door Sadok came forth, gibbering in his\ntangled beard, and half naked.\n\n\"Oh, brother!\" said Ben-Abid. \"Here is money if thou canst find me three\nscorpions. One of them must be a black scorpion.\"\n\nSadok shot out his filthy claw, and there was fire in his eyes. But\nBen-Abid's fingers closed round the money paper.\n\n\"First thou must find the scorpions, and then thou must carry them with\nthee to the court of the dancers, walking at my side. For, as Allah\nlives, I will not touch them. Afterwards thou shalt have the money.\"\n\nSadok's soul drew the shutters across his eyes. Then he led the way by\ntortuous alleys to an old and ruined wall of a _zgag_, in which there\nwere as many holes as there are in a honeycomb. Here, as he knew,\nthe scorpions loved to sleep. Thrusting his fingers here and there he\npresently drew forth three writhing reptiles. And one of them was black.\nHe held them out, with a cry, to Ben-Abid.\n\n\"The money! The money!\" he shrieked.\n\nBut Ben-Abid shrank back, shuddering.\n\n\"Thou must bring them to the dancers' court. Hide them well in thy\ngarments that none may see them. Then thou shalt have the money.\"\n\nSadok hid the scorpions upon his shaven head beneath his turban, and\nthey went by the dunes and the lonely ways to the cafe of the dancers.\n\nAlready the pipers were playing, and many were assembled to see the\nwomen dance; but Ben-Abid and Sadok pushed through the throng, and\npassed across the cafe to the inner court, which is open to the air, and\nsurrounded with earthen terraces on which, in tiers, open the rooms of\nthe dancers, each with its own front door. This court is as a mighty\nrabbit warren, peopled with women instead of rabbits. Pale lights\ngleamed in many doorways, for the dancers were dressing and painting\nthemselves for the dances of the body, of the hands, of the poignard,\nand of the handkerchief. Their shrill voices cried one to another, their\nheavy bracelets and necklets jingled, and the monstrous shadows of\ntheir crowned and feathered heads leaped and wavered on the yellow\npatches of light that lay before their doors.\n\n\"Where is Halima?\" cried Ben-Abid in a loud voice. \"Let Halima come\nforth and spit in my face!\"\n\nAt the sound of his call many women ran to their doors, some half\ndressed, some fully attired, like Jezebels of the great desert.\n\n\"It is Ben-Abid!\" went up the cry of many voices. \"It is Ben-Abid, who\nlaughs to scorn the power of the hedgehog's foot. It is the son of the\ncamel with the swollen tongue. Halima, Halima, the child of the scorpion\ncalls thee!\"\n\nKouidah, the boy, who was ever about, ran barefoot from the court into\nthe cafe to tell of the doings of Ben-Abid, and in a moment the people\ncrowded in, Zouaves and Spahis, Arabs and negroes, nomads from the\nsouth, gipsies, jugglers, and Jews. There were, too, some from Tamacine,\nand these were of all the most intent.\n\n\"Where is Halima?\" went up the cry. \"Where is Halima?\"\n\n\"Who calls me?\" exclaimed the voice of a girl.\n\nAnd Halima came out of her door on the first terrace at the left,\nsplendidly dressed for the dance in scarlet and gold, carrying two\nscarlet handkerchiefs in her hands, and with the hedgehog's foot\ndangling from her girdle of thin gold, studded with turquoises.\n\nBen-Abid stood below in the court with Sadok by his side. The crowd\npressed about him from behind.\n\n\"Thou hast called me the son of a scorpion, Halima,\" he said, in a loud\nvoice. \"Is it not true?\"\n\n\"It is true,\" she answered, with a venomous smile of hatred. \"And thou\nhast said that the hedgehog's foot, blessed by the great marabout\nof Tamacine, would avail naught against the deadly sickness of a\ndancing-girl. Is it not true?\"\n\n\"It is true,\" answered Ben-Abid.\n\n\"Thou art a liar!\" cried Halima.\n\n\"And so art thou!\" said Ben-Abid slowly.\n\nA deep murmur rose from the crowd, which pressed more closely beneath\nthe terrace, staring up at the scarlet figure upon it.\n\n\"If I am a liar thou canst not prove it!\" cried Halima furiously. \"I\nspit upon thee! I spit upon thee!\"\n\nAnd she bent down her feathered head from the terrace and spat\npassionately in his face.\n\nBen-Abid only laughed aloud.\n\n\"I can prove that I have spoken the truth,\" he said. \"But if I am\nindeed the son of a scorpion, as thou sayest, let my brothers speak for\nme. Let my brothers declare to all the Sahara that the truth is in my\nmouth. Sadok, remove thy turban!\"\n\nThe plunger of the wells, with a frantic gesture, lifted his turban and\ndiscovered the three scorpions writhing upon his shaven head. Another,\nand longer, murmur went up from the crowd. But some shrank back and\ntrembled, for the desert Arabs are much afraid of scorpions, which cause\nmany deaths in the Sahara.\n\n\"What is this?\" cried Halima. \"How can the scorpions speak for thee?\"\n\n\"They shall speak well,\" said Ben-Abid. \"Their voices cannot lie. Sleep\nto-night in thy room with these my brothers. Irena and Boria, the Golden\nDate and the Lotus Flower, shall watch beside thee. Guard in thy hand,\nor in thy breast, the hedgehog's foot that thou sayest can preserve\nfrom every ill. If, in the evening of to-morrow, thou dancest before the\nsoldiers, I will give thee fifty golden coins. But, if thou dancest not,\nthe city shall know whether Ben-Abid is a truth-teller, and whether the\nblessings of the great marabout can rest upon such a woman as thou art.\nIf thou refusest thou art afraid, and thy fear proveth that thou hast no\nfaith in the magic treasure that dangles at thy girdle.\"\n\nThere was a moment of deep silence. Then, from the crowd burst forth the\ncry of many voices:\n\n\"Put it to the proof! Ben-Abid speaks well. Put it to the proof, and may\nAllah judge between them.\"\n\nBeneath the caked pigments on her face Halima had gone pale.\n\n\"I will not,\" she began.\n\nBut the cries rose up again, and with them the shrill, twittering\nlaughter of her envious rivals.\n\n\"She has no faith in the marabout!\" squawked one, who had a nose like an\neagle's beak.\n\n\"She is a liar!\" piped another, shaking out her silken petticoats as a\nbird shakes out its plumes.\n\nAnd then the twitter of fierce laughter rose, shriek on shriek, and was\nechoed more deeply by the crowd of watching men.\n\n\"Give me the scorpions!\" cried Halima passionately. \"I am not afraid!\"\n\nHer desert blood was up. Her fatalism--even in the women of the Sahara\nit lurks--was awake. In that moment she was ready to die, to silence\nthe bitter laughter of her rivals. It sank away as Sadok grasped the\nscorpions in his filthy claw, and leaped, gibbering in his beard, upon\nthe terrace.\n\n\"Wait!\" cried Halima, as he came upon her, holding forth his handful of\nwrithing poison.\n\nHer bosom heaved. Her lustrous eyes, heavy with kohl, shone like those\nof a beast at bay.\n\nSadok stood still, with his naked arm outstretched.\n\n\"How shall I know that the son of a scorpion will pay me the fifty\ngolden coins? He is poor, though he speaks bravely. He is but a singer\nin the cafe of the smokers of the hashish, and cannot buy even a new\ngarment for the close of the feast of Ramadan. How, then, shall I know\nthat the gold will hang from my breasts when to-morrow, at the falling\nof the sun, I dance before the men of Toug--\"\n\nBen-Abid put his hand beneath his burnous, and brought forth a bag tied\nat the mouth with cord.\n\n\"They are here!\" he said.\n\n\"The Jews! He has been to the Jews!\" cried the desert men.\n\n\"Bring a lamp!\" said Ben-Abid.\n\nAnd while Irena and Boria, the Golden Date and the Lotus Flower, held\nthe lights, and the desert men crowded about him with the eyes of wolves\nthat are near to starving, he counted forth the money on the terrace at\nHalima's feet. And she gazed down at the glittering pieces as one that\ngazes upon a black fate.\n\n\"And now set my brothers upon the maiden,\" Ben-Abid said to Sadok,\ngathering up the money, and casting it again into the bag, which he tied\nonce more with the cord.\n\nHalima did not move, but she looked upon the scorpion that was black,\nand her red lips trembled. Then she closed her hand upon the hedgehog's\nfoot that hung from her golden girdle, and shut her eyes beneath her\nebon eyebrows.\n\n\"Set my brothers upon her!\" said Ben-Abid.\n\nThe plunger of the wells sprang upon Halima, opened her scarlet\nbodice roughly, plunged his claw into her swelling bosom, and withdrew\nit--empty.\n\n\"Kiss her close, my brothers!\" whispered Ben-Abid.\n\nA long murmur, like the growl of the tide upon a shingly beach, arose\nonce more from the crowd. Halima turned about, and went slowly in at her\nlighted doorway, followed by Irena and Boria. The heavy door of palm was\nshut behind them. The light was hidden. There was a great silence. It\nwas broken by Sadok's voice screaming in his beard to Ben-Abid, \"My\nmoney! Give me my money!\"\n\nHe snatched it with a howl, and went capering forth into the darkness.\n\n*****\n\nWhen the next night fell upon the desert there was a great crowd\nassembled in the cafe of the dancers. The pipers blew into their pipes,\nand swayed upon their haunches, turning their glittering eyes to and\nfro to see what man had a mind to press a piece of money upon their well\ngreased foreheads. The dancers came and went, promenading arm in arm\nupon the earthen floor, or leaping with hands outstretched and fingers\nfluttering. The Kabyle attendant slipped here and there with the coffee\ncups, and the wreaths of smoke curled lightly upward towards the wooden\nroof.\n\nBut Halima came not through the open doorway holding the scarlet\nhandkerchiefs above her head.\n\nAnd presently, late in the night, they laid her body in a palanquin, and\nset the palanquin upon a running camel, and, while the dancers shrilled\ntheir lament amid the sands, they bore her away into the darkness of the\ndunes towards the south and the tents of her own people.\n\nThe jackals laughed as she went by.\n\nBut the hedgehog's foot was left lying upon the floor of her chamber.\nNot one of the dancers would touch it.\n\nThat night I was in the cafe, and, hearing of all these things from\nKouidah, the boy, I went into the court, and gathered up the trinket\nwhich had brought a woman to the great silence. Next day I rode on\nhorseback to Tamacine, asked to see the marabout and told him all the\nstory.\n\nHe listened, smiling like the rising sun in an oleograph, and twisting\nin his huge hands, that were tinted with the henna, the staff with the\napple-green ribbons.\n\nWhen I came to the end I said:\n\n\"O, holy marabout, tell me one thing.\"\n\n\"Allah is just. I listen.\"\n\n\"If the scorpions had slept with a veiled woman who held the hedgehog's\nfoot, how would it have been? Would the woman have died or lived?\"\n\nThe marabout did not answer. He looked at me calmly, as at a child\nwho asks questions about the mysteries of life which only the old can\nunderstand.\n\n\"These things,\" he said at length, \"are hidden from the unbeliever. You\nare a Roumi. How, then, should you learn such matters?\"\n\n\"But even the Roumi----\"\n\n\"In the desert there are mysteries,\" continued the marabout, \"which\neven the faithful must not seek to penetrate.\"\n\n\"Then it is useless to----\"\n\n\"It is very useless. It is as useless as to try to count the grains of\nthe sand.\"\n\nI said no more.\n\nMohammed El Aid Ben Ali Tidjani smiled once more, and beckoned to a\nnegro attendant, who ran with a musical box, one of the gifts of the\nfaithful.\n\n\"This comes from Paris,\" he said, with a spreading complacence.\n\nThen there was within the box a sounding click, and there stole forth a\ntinkling of Auber's music to _Masaniello_, \"Come o'er the moonlit sea!\"",
