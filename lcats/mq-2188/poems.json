Many a sail full set\n      Is homeward speeding, bearing happy hearts\n      To where love anxious waits and eager eyes\n      Will sweetest welcome give. O, World rejoice!\n      Confronted by the swift incoming tide,\n      With hurried step we scale the dizzy cliff,\n      Delivered by the one all-potent hand,\n      That ever waits to still life's sternest storms.\n\n\n\n\n_THE MARCH OF TIME._\n\n\n      Steadily marching, swift or slow,\n      Moments and months and days they go.\n      Moments and months and days and years\n      Laden with hope and love and tears.\n\n      Laden with hope that cheered the way\n      When earth lay wrapped in twilight gray,\n      In twilight gray, till shining through\n      The fair, sweet promise grew and grew.\n\n      Fair, sweet promise of joy, of bliss,\n      We should not, could not, would not, miss\n      Of bliss so perfect, bliss so true,\n      We fain would keep that bliss in view.\n\n      Steadily marching, swift or slow,\n      Moments and months and days they go,\n      Moments and months and days and years,\n      And then\u2014eternity appears.\n\n\n\n\n_A GIFT._\n\n\n      It was given him in youth,\n        Bestowed by a kingly hand;\n      Sweet as the flower of truth,\n        When its first fair buds expand.\n      It was given him to prize,\n        To guard with a jealous care;\n      This gift in a humble guise\n        But precious beyond compare.\n\n      It was given him\u2014he turned\n        From promise so close concealed,\n      Although in his soul he yearned\n        To follow the unrevealed.\n      He turned from a gift which came\n        In the flush of boyhood days,\n      It clung to him just the same\n        As he trod the world's wild maze.\n\n      It was given him\u2014it slept,\n        But would not be cast aside;\n      Till into his heart it crept\n        A-quiver with love and pride.\n      Yes, into his heart it crept,\n        He worked with a new-born skill;\n      And whether he laughed or wept\n        He worked with a steadfast will.\n\n      It was given him\u2014he caught\n        It close to his heaving breast\n      And a miracle was wrought,\n        For a genius stood confessed.\n      The gift which he held the least\n        Was the gift the Lord had sent;\n      Lo, the angel at the feast\n        He had misnamed, discontent.\n\n\n\n\n_WOULD WE DWELL ON THE MOUNTAIN\n\nHEIGHT?_\n\n\n      Would we dwell on the mountain height\n      Whence the world is lovely and bright.\n        Then we must be eager to climb,\n          Ready and willing to press\n        For the noble, the true, the sublime,\n          To comfort, to bless.\n\n      Would we stand like heroes of yore\n      When life's sternest conflicts are o'er,\n        Would we stand triumphant at last,\n          Or weep the chances we miss\n        As the tide of the battle sweeps past\u2014\n          To conquer is bliss.\n\n      Would we see the foemen retreat,\n      The foemen we dreaded to meet,\n        Battalions of pain, of despair:\u2014\n          On! it is never too late!\n        Let us strive for a heritage fair,\n          A royal estate.\n\n\n\n\n_CHILL NOT THE HEART THAT TRUSTS\n\nTHEE._\n\n\n      Chill not the heart that trusts thee, O, my soul!\n        Be brave to bear, to suffer, to forgive;\n      Life's tempestuous billows wildly roll\n                But love and live.\n\n      Chill not the heart that trusts thee, though thine eyes\n        With tears are dim, and ev'ry effort pain;\n      A day reveals, perchance, this sad surprise,\n                Eternal gain.\n\n      Chill not the heart that trusts thee, dark indeed\n        The way may seem, but sacred is the trust\n      Of faith, which while it may not stoop to plead\n                Is ever just.\n\n      Chill not the heart that trusts thee, cares defeat\n        The true, the good, the noble, who can tell?\n      Truth's eagle glance may yet direct thy feet\n                And all be well.\n\n      Chill not the heart that trusts thee, O, my soul!\n        Be brave to bear, to suffer\u2014to forgive;\n      Life's tempestuous billows wildly roll\n                But love and live.\n\n\n\n\n_HE LIES IN STATE._\n\n  _Frederic T.

By memory's pearly gate\n          He lies in state.\n\n          The regal state,\n      That only kingly souls can come to know,\n          Which truth and character alone create:\n          He lies in state.\n\n\n\n\n_HOPE-ON-RIVER._\n\n\n      Hope-On-River leads to bliss;\n      Who would such a journey miss?\n      O'er the waters, limpid, sweet,\n      Floating to the Saviour's feet.\n\n      Hope-On-River is divine,\n      Fairer than the storied Rhine;\n      On its bosom homeward glide,\n      Moving with the gentle tide.\n\n      Hope-On-River runs for all,\n      Runs beyond the jasper wall\u2014\n      Runs to weary pilgrims bear\n      Past the portals of despair.\n\n      Hope-On-River ever flows,\n      Purest, sweetest, mortal knows,\n      On its waters float to rest\n      In the city of the blest.\n\n\n\n\n_AT SEA._\n\n\n      Afar the timid moonbeams shyly creep\n        Behind a purple pall of clouds so drear,\n        It smites the captain's loyal heart with fear;\n      Vainly would he a keener vigil keep,\n        Yet few would dream the traitor, Danger, near,\n        Till through yon misty curtain clean and clear\n        And swift the gleaming lights of death appear,\n      Twin-born. Alas! men waken from sweet sleep\n      Too late to seek escape; the vessel thrills\n        In ev'ry nerve, an almost human groan\n      Wells from her tortured breast; she reels, she fills.\n        A hundred anguished souls for mercy moan\u2014\n      But kindly, Time, the storm of terror stills\n        And meek Diana treads the night alone.\n\n\n\n\n_MIRTH._\n\n\n      Who has not felt his pulses gaily leap\n        And throb and burn, the feeble step grow light\n        And freer speed to scale life's fairest height\n      As some sweet song, or merry jest or deep\n      Toned humorous note lulls lagging care to sleep.\n        Man may be mirthful built and yet contrite,\n        May bear a buoyant heart through darkest night\n      Whilst hope and love their angel vigil keep\n        Twin foes of fear and gloom. Oh, loyal soul\n      That dares to walk upright with dauntless tread;\n        Amid the din of battle and the roll\n      Of thunder-guns storm shattered o'er thy head,\n        Press on, press ever onward, to the goal,\n      And round thee joy-refulgent freely shed.\n\n\n\n\n_FLORA._\n\n\n      In a dainty robe of green\n      Comes the nodding daffadilly\n      And the stately Easter lily;\n      In the meadows cowslips shimmer,\n      Crocuses with dewdrops glimmer;\n      April's smile and May's soft splendor\n      Linger o'er us gentle, tender;\n      Fair forget-me-nots convene\n      In the most delightful places;\n      Mount and vale are wrapped in glory,\n      Greylock doffs his tippet hoary,\n      And Wachusett stands new crowned\n      Thanks to Flora, queen of graces;\n      Laurel draped and daisy gowned.\n\n\n\n\n_WHERE PASSACONAWAY WAS WONT TO\n\nSTAND._\n\n\n      Where Passaconaway was wont to stand,\n        Piercing the distance with intrepid eye,\n        The teeming mills their rhythmic shuttles ply.\n      Many knelt subservient to the hand\n      Of that good sachem of a noted band;\n        But labor like a chieftain, leads us high,\n        To fairer fields where richer guerdons lie\n      Than he aspired to win; the bold demand\n      Of Time is met by a triumphant throng\n        Which presses onward, upward, evermore;\n      And cities in their children true as strong\n        Live worthy the brave men who marched before,\n      Speeding the hum of Industry's glad song\n        O'er heights the noble red man trod of yore.\n\n\n\n\n_SPRING._\n\n\n      Wooed by thy balmy breath, O witching Spring.\n        The woodland nymphs are charming us anew,\n        And yon blue dome acquires a richer hue.\n      Waked from its winter's sleep on gauzy wing,\n      The butterfly flits past no more to cling\n        A slave forlorn to some enamored branch.\n        How joyfully the laughing lilies launch\n      Their dainty barques; they safe at anchor swing\n        In many a sylvan nook.
