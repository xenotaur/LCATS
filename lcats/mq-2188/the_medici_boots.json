    "body": "For fifty years they lay under glass in the Dickerson museum and they\nwere labeled \"The Medici Boots.\" They were fashioned of creamy\nleather, pliable as a young girl's hands. They were threaded with\nsilver, appliqued with sapphire silks and scarlet, and set on the tip\nof each was a pale and lovely amethyst. Such were the Medici boots.\n\nOld Silas Dickerson, globe-trotter and collector, had brought the\nboots from a dusty shop in Florence when he was a young man filled\nwith the lust for travel and adventure. The years passed and Silas\nDickerson was an old man, his hair white, his eyes dim, his veined\nhands trembling with the ague that precedes death.\n\nWhen he was ninety and the years of his wanderings over, Silas\nDickerson died one morning as he sat in a high-backed Venetian chair\nin his private museum. The Fourteenth Century gold-leaf paintings, the\nJapanese processional banners, the stolen bones of a Normandy\nsaint--all the beloved trophies of his travels must have watched the\ndead man impassively for hours before his housekeeper found him.\n\nThe old man sat with his head thrown back against the faded tapestry\nof the Venetian chair, his eyes closed, his bony arms extended along\nthe beautifully carved arms of the chair, and on his lap lay the\nMedici boots.\n\nIt was high noon when they found him, and the sun was streaming\nthrough the stained-glass window above the chair and picking at the\namethysts, so that the violet stones seemed to eye Marthe, the old\nhousekeeper, with an impudent glitter. Marthe muttered a prayer and\ncrossed herself, before she ran like a scared rabbit with the news of\nthe master's death.\n\nSilas Dickerson's only surviving relatives, the three young\nDelameters, did not take too seriously the note which was found among\nthe papers in the museum's desk. Old Silas had written the note. It\nwas addressed to John Delameter, for John was his uncle's favorite,\nbut John's pretty wife, Suzanne, and his twin brother, Doctor Eric,\nread it over his shoulder; and they all smiled tolerantly. Old\nDickerson had written of things incomprehensible to the young moderns:\n\n\"The contents of my private museum are yours, John, to do with as you\nsee fit. Merely as a suggestion, I would say that the Antiquarian\nSociety would snap up many of the things. A very few are of no\nparticular value, except to me. One thing I want done, however. The\nMedici boots of ivory leather must either be destroyed or be put for\never under glass in a _public_ museum. I prefer that they be\ndestroyed, for they are a dangerous possession. They have gone to the\nadulterous rendezvous celebrated in the scandalous verses of Lorenzo\nthe Magnificent. They have shod the feet of a murderess. They were\ncursed by the Church as trappings of the Devil, inciting the wearer to\nfoul deeds and intrigue.\n\n\"I shall not disturb you with all their hideous history, but I repeat,\nthey are a dangerous possession. I have taken care to keep them under\nlock and key, behind plate glass, for more than fifty years. I have\nnever taken them out. Destroy the Medici boots, before they destroy\nyou!\"\n\n\"But he did take them out!\" cried Suzanne. \"Uncle was holding the\nboots when--when Marthe found him there in the museum.\"\n\nJohn reread the note, and looked thoughtfully at his young wife. \"Yes.\nPerhaps he was preparing to destroy them right then. Of course, I\nthink the poor old fellow took things a bit too seriously--he was very\nold, you know, and Marthe says he practically lived in this museum of\nhis.\"\n\n\"And why call a pair of old boots dangerous? Of course, we all know\nthe Medicis were plenty dangerous, but the Medici boots--that's\nridiculous, John. Besides----\"\n\nSuzanne paused provocatively, her red lips pouting. She looked down at\nher trimly shod feet. \"Besides, I'd like to try on those Medici\nboots--just once. They're lovely, I think.\"\n\nJohn was frowning thoughtfully. He scarcely heard her suggestion. He\nspoke to Eric, instead, and his voice seemed a bit troubled.\n\n\"I believe that Uncle _was_ getting ready to destroy those boots that\nvery morning he died; else why should he have taken them from their\ncase--after fifty years?\"\n\n\"Yes, I believe you're right, John, because that note is dated fully a\nmonth before Uncle's death. I think he brooded over leaving those\nboots to one he cared for. Poor old man!\"\n\n\"I wouldn't call him so, Eric. He had his dreams of adventure realized\nmore fully than most men. I--I think I'll do as he says. I'll destroy\nthe Medici boots.\"\n\n\"If you'd feel better about it,\" assented his brother. But Suzanne did\nnot speak. She was looking at her shoe, pursing her lips thoughtfully,\nseeing her feet encased in the gay embroideries of the Medici boots.\n\nJohn seemed relieved by his decision. \"Yes, I'd better do it. We'll be\ngetting back to town in a few days. Old Erskine, you know, Uncle's\nlawyer, is coming down this afternoon. Then soon we'll be on the wing,\nSusie and I--Vienna, Paris, the Alps--thanks to Uncle.\"\n\n\"Maybe you think I'm not thankful for my chance at a bit more work at\nJohns Hopkins,\" said Eric, and they did not again speak of the Medici\nboots.\n\n\n\nThe deaf old lawyer of the Dickerson estate arrived, and Suzanne, with\nthe easy capability that was part of her charm, saw that he was made\ncomfortable.\n\nAt seven there was a perfect dinner served on the awninged terrace\noutside the softly lit living-room. The stars aided the two little\nrosy lamps on the table, and swaying willows beside a stone-encircled\npool swung the incense of the garden about them.\n\nAs dinner ended, John took from the pocket of his coat a small,\nlimp-leather book. He pushed back his dessert plate and laid the book\non the table, tapping it with a finger as he spoke.\n\n\"This is the history of the Medici boots. It was in the little\nwall-safe in the museum. After all Uncle said of the Medici boots,\nshall we read it?\" And turning to the old lawyer, he told of Silas\nDickerson's letter concerning the boots.\n\nErskine shook his head, smiling. \"Most collectors get an exaggerated\nsense of the supernatural. Read this, by all means--it should prove\ninteresting.\"\n\n\"Yes, read it, John.\" Suzanne and Eric spoke almost together.\n\nSo, in the circle of rosy light at their little table, John read the\nstory of the Medici boots. It was not a long story and it was told in\nthe language of an anonymous translator, but as John read on, his\nlisteners were drawn together, as by a spell. They scarcely breathed,\nand the summer night that was so mildly beautiful seemed to take on a\nsense of hovering danger.\n\n    \"In the palace of Giuliano de' Medici I have lived long. I am\n    an old woman now, as the years are reckoned in this infamous\n    place, though I am but fifty and three.\n\n    \"Separated from my betrothed, duped, sold into the marble\n    labyrinth of this hateful palace, it was long before my\n    spirit broke and I went forth, bejeweled and attired in\n    elegance, among the silk-clad Florentines. I was labeled the\n    most beautiful mistress of any of the Medici. I was smirked\n    at, fawned upon for my lord's favors, obscenely jested about\n    in the orgies that took place in the great banquet hall of\n    the palace.\n\n    \"But in my heart always lay the remembrance of my lost love,\n    and in my soul grew black hatred for the Medici and all their\n    kind. I, who had dreamed only of a modest home, a kind\n    husband, black-haired, trusting little children, was made a\n    tool of the Medici infamy.\n\n    \"In time, I almost felt myself in league with the Devil.\n    Secretly, and with a growing sense of elation, I made\n    frequent rendezvous with a foul hag whose very name was\n    anathema to the churchly folk of Florence. In her hole of a\n    room in a certain noisome street, she imparted to me those\n    terrible secrets of the Black Arts which were deep in her\n    soul. It was amusing that she was paid in Medici gold.\n\n    \"The corruption of the Medici bred in them fear; in me a sort\n    of reckless bravery. It was I who poisoned the wine of many a\n    foe of the Medici. It was I who put the point of a dagger in\n    the heart of the old Prince de Vittorio, whose lands and\n    power and palaces were coveted by my lord, Giuliano.\n\n    \"After a time, bloodshed became an exhilaration to me; the\n    death agonies of those who drank the poisoned cup became more\n    interesting than the flattery of the Medici followers. Even\n    the ladies of the house of the Medici did me the honor of\n    their subtly barbed friendliness.\n\n    \"Through this very friendliness, I conceived my plan of sweet\n    revenge upon the monsters who had ruined my life. With so\n    great a hatred boiling in my soul that my mind reeled, my\n    senses throbbed, my heart rose in my throat like a spurt of\n    flame, I cursed three things of exquisite beauty with all the\n    fervor of my newly learned lessons in devilish lore.\n\n    \"These three beautiful objects I presented to three ladies of\n    the house of Medici--presented them with honeyed words of\n    mock humility. A necklace of jeweled links--I pledged myself\n    to the Devil and willed that the golden necklace would\n    tighten on the soft throat of a lady of the Medici while she\n    slept, and strangle her into black death. A bracelet of\n    filigree and sapphires--to pierce by its hidden silver needle\n    the blue vein in a white Medici wrist, so that her life's\n    blood would spurt and she would know the terror that the\n    house of the Medici gave to others.\n\n    \"Last, and most ingenious, a pair of creamy boots, pliable,\n    embroidered in silver and silks, encrusted with amethysts--my\n    betrothal jewels. In my hatred I cursed the boots, willing\n    that the wearer, as long as a shred of the boots remained,\n    should kill as I had killed, poison as I had poisoned, leave\n    all thoughts of home and husband and live in wantonness and\n    evil. So I cursed the beautiful boots, forgetting, in my\n    hate, that perhaps another than a Medici might, in the years\n    to come, wear them and become the Devil's pawn, even as I am\n    now.\n\n    \"In my life, the Medici will have the boots, of that I feel\n    sure; but after that--I can only hope that this bloody\n    history of the boots may be found when I am no more, and may\n    it be a warning.\n\n    \"I have lived to see my gifts received and worn, and I have\n    laughed in my soul to see my curses bring death and terror\n    and evil to three Medici women. I know not what will become\n    of the golden necklace, the bracelet, or the boots. The boots\n    may be lost or stolen, or they may lie in a Medici palace for\n    age on age, but the curse will cling to them till they are\n    destroyed. So I pray that no woman, save a Medici, will ever\n    wear them.\n\n    \"As I live and breathe and do the bidding of the lords of\n    Florence, the accursed Medici--I have told the truth. When I\n    am dead, perhaps they will find this book, and, in hell, I\n    shall know and be glad.\n\n                           \"MARIA MODENA DI CAVOURI.\n\n                                             \"Florence, 1476.\"\n\n\n\n\"Whew!\" said old Erskine.\n\nJohn laughed. \"I don't suppose this charming history would have been\nany more thrilling if I had read it from the original book, in\nItalian, of course. Wonder where Uncle got it! There was no mention of\nit being in the library--but there it was.\"\n\n\"Now, will you destroy those boots?\" asked Eric, and he was not\nentirely in jest.\n\nBut Suzanne said, laughingly, \"Not before I find out if the Medici\nlady had a smaller foot than I! Are they still in the museum, John?\"\n\n\"Never you mind, my dear. They're not for the likes of you.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't be silly, John. This is 1935, not the Fifteenth Century.\"\nAnd they laughed at Suzanne's earnestness.\n\nThe book that held the story of the Medici boots lay on the white\ncloth, looking like a book of lovely verse.\n\nSuzanne, a small white blur against the summer dark, sat quietly while\nthe men talked of Silas Dickerson, his life, his mania for collecting,\nhis death that had so fittingly come to him in his museum. It was\nnearly twelve when Suzanne left the men on the terrace and with a\nquiet \"good-night\" entered the living-room and crossed to the long,\nshining stairs.\n\nThe men went on with their talk. Once, John, looking toward the\njutting wing that was the museum, exclaimed, \"Look at that, will you?\nWhy--I'd swear I saw a light in the museum.\"\n\n\"You locked it, didn't you?\" asked Eric.\n\n\"Of course; the key's in my desk upstairs. H-m. I'm probably mistaken,\nbut it did seem as though a light shone there just a moment ago.\"\n\n\"Reflection from the living-room window, I think. Country life is\nmaking you jittery, John.\" And Eric laughed at his brother.\n\nThe men sat on, reluctant to leave the beauty of the night, and it was\nalmost two o'clock when they finally went inside.\n\nJohn said, \"I think I'll not disturb Suzanne.\" And he went to sleep in\na wide four-postered bed in a room next to his wife. Eric and the old\nlawyer were in rooms across the hall.\n\n\n\nThe still summer night closed about the house of Silas Dickerson, and\nwhen the moon lay dying against the bank of cloud, puffed across a sky\nby the little wind that came before dawn, young Doctor Eric Delameter\nawoke, suddenly and completely, to a feeling of clammy apprehension.\nHe had not locked his door, and now, across the grayness of the room,\nhe saw it slowly opening.\n\nA hand was closed around the edge of the door--a woman's hand, small\nand white and jeweled. Eric sat straight and tense on the edge of his\nbed, peering across the room. A woman, young and slender, in a long,\ntrailing gown, came toward him smiling. It was Suzanne.\n\nWith a gasp, Eric watched her approach till she stood directly before\nhim.\n\n\"Suzanne! You are asleep? Suzanne, shall I call John?\"\n\nHe thought that perhaps he should not waken her; there were things one\nmust remember about sleep-walkers, but physicians scarcely believed\nthem.\n\nEric was puzzled, too, by her costume. It was not a night-robe she\nwore, but an elaborate, trailing dress upon which embroideries in\nsilver shone faintly. Her short black curls were bound about three\ntimes with strands of pearly beads, her slim white arms were loaded\nwith bracelets. The pointed toes of little shoes peeped beneath her\ngown, little shoes of creamy leather. An amethyst gleamed on each\nshoe.\n\nThe sight of these amethystine tips affected Eric strangely, much as\nthough he had looked at something hideously repulsive. He stood up and\nput out a hand to touch Suzanne's arm.\n\n\"Suzanne,\" he said, gently. \"Let me take you to John. Shall I?\"\n\nSuzanne looked up at him, and her brown eyes, usually so merry, were\ndeeply slumberous, not with sleep, but with a look of utter abandon.\nShe shook her pearl-bound head slowly, smilingly.\n\n\"No, not John. I want you, Eric.\"\n\n\"Mad! Suzanne must be mad!\" was Eric's quick thought, but her caress\nwas swifter than his thought. Both jewel-laden arms about his neck,\nSuzanne kissed him, her red lips pouting warmly upon his.\n\n\"Suzanne! You don't know what you're doing.\" He grasped both her hands\nin his and with a haste that would have seemed ludicrous to him had he\nviewed the scene in a picture-play, he hurried her out of his room and\nacross the hall.\n\nEric opened her door softly and with no gentle hand shoved Suzanne\ninside her room. She seemed like a little animal in his grasp. She\nhissed at him; clawed and scratched at his hand. But when he had shut\nthe door, she did not open it again, and after a moment he went back\nto his own room.\n\n\n\nHis mouth set in a firm line, his heart beating fast, Eric locked his\ndoor with a noiseless turn of the key. It was almost dawn, and the\ngarden lay like a rare pastel outside his window; but Eric saw none of\nit. He scarcely thought, though his lips moved, as if chaotic words\nwere struggling for utterance.\n\nHe looked down at his hand, where two long red scratches oozed a\ntrickle of blood. After he had washed his hand, he lay down on his bed\nand covered his eyes with his arm, against the picture of Suzanne.\nAbove all else there stood out the gleaming tips of her little shoes,\nas he had glimpsed them through the dim light of his room when she\ncame toward him.\n\n\"She wore the Medici boots! The Medici boots! Suzanne must have taken\nthem from the museum!\" Over and over he said it--\"The Medici boots!\nThe Medici boots!\"\n\nEric rather dreaded breakfast, but when he came down at eight, to the\nterrace where a rustic table was set invitingly, he found John and the\nlawyer awaiting him. John greeted his brother affectionately.\n\n\"Morning, old boy! Hope you slept well. Why so solemn? Feeling seedy?\"\n\n\"No, no. I am perfectly all right,\" Eric replied hastily, relieved\nthat Suzanne was not present. He added with a scarcely noticeable\nhesitation, \"Suzanne not coming down?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied John, easily. \"She seemed to want to sleep awhile. Sent\nher regrets. She'll see us at lunch.\"\n\nJohn went on. \"I certainly had a nightmare last night. Thought a woman\nin a long, shining dress came into my room and tried to stab me. This\nmorning I found that a glass on my bed-table was overturned and\nbroken, and, by George, I'd cut my wrist on it.\"\n\nHe showed a jagged cut on his wrist. \"Take a look, Doctor Eric.\"\n\nEric looked at the cut, carefully. \"Not bad, but you might have bled\nto death, had it been a quarter of an inch to the left. If you like,\nI'll fix it up a bit for you after breakfast.\"\n\nEric's voice was calm enough, but his pulse was pounding, his heart\nsick. All morning he rode through the countryside adjoining the\nDickerson estate, but he let the mare go as she liked and where she\nliked, for his mind was busy with the events of the hour before dawn.\nHe knew that the slash on his brother's wrist was made by steel, not\nglass. Yet when the ride was over, he could not bring himself to tell\nJohn of Suzanne's visit.\n\n\"She must have been sleep-walking, though I can't account for the way\nshe was decked out. I've always thought Suzanne extremely modest in\nher dress, certainly not inclined to load herself with jewelry. And\nthose boots! John must get them today and destroy them, as he said.\nSilly, perhaps, but----\" His thoughts went on and on, always returning\nto the Medici boots, in spite of himself.\n\n\n\nEric came back from his ride at eleven o'clock, with as troubled a\nmind as when he began it. He almost feared to see Suzanne at lunch.\n\nWhen he did meet her with John and Mr. Erskine on the cool, shaded\nporch where they lunched, he saw there was nothing to fear. The\namorous, clinging woman of the hour before dawn was not there at all.\nThere was only the Suzanne whom Eric knew and loved as a sister.\n\nHere, again, was their merry little Suzanne, somewhat spoiled by her\nhusband, it is true, but a Suzanne sweetly feminine, almost childish\nin a crisp, white frock and little, low-heeled sandals. Their talk was\nlazily pleasant--of tennis honors and horses, of the prize delphiniums\nin the garden, of the tiny maltese kitten which Suzanne had brought up\nfrom the stables late that morning and installed in a pink-bowed\nbasket on the porch. She showed the kitten to Eric, handling its tiny\npaws gently, hushing its plaintive mews with ridiculous pet names.\n\n\"Perhaps I'm a bigger fool than I know. Perhaps it never happened,\nexcept in a dream,\" Eric told himself, unhappily. \"And yet----\"\n\nHe looked at the red marks on his hand, marks made by a furious\nSuzanne in that hour before the dawn. Too, he remembered the cut on\nJohn's wrist, the cut so near the vein.\n\nEric declined John's invitation to go through the museum with him that\nafternoon, but he said with a queer sense of diffidence, \"While\nyou're there, John, you'd better get rid of the Medici boots. Creepy\nthings to have around, I think.\"\n\n\"They'll be destroyed, all right. But Suzanne is just bound to try\nthem on. I'll get them, though, and do as Uncle said.\"\n\nEric remained on the terrace, speculating somewhat on just what John\nand Suzanne would do, now that the huge fortune of Silas Dickerson was\ntheirs. Eric was not envious of his brother's good luck, and he was\nthankful for his share in old Silas' generosity.\n\nAt five o'clock he entered the hall, just as Suzanne hurried in from\nthe kitchen. She spread our her hands, laughingly.\n\n\"With my own fair hands I've made individual almond tortonis for\ndessert. Cook thinks I'm a wonder! Each masterpiece in a fluted silver\ndish, silver candies sprinkled on the pink whipped cream! O-oh!\"\n\nShe made big eyes in mock gluttony. Eric forgot, for a moment, that\nthere ever had been another Suzanne.\n\n\"You're nothing but a little girl, Suzie. You with your rhapsodies\nover pink whipped cream! But it's sweet of you to go to such trouble\non a warm afternoon. See you and the whatever-you-call-'ems at\ndinner!\"\n\n\"They're tortonis, Eric, tortonis.\"\n\nSuzanne ran lightly up the stairs. Eric followed more slowly. He\nentered his room thinking that there were some things which must be\nexplained in this house with the old museum.\n\n\n\nTwenty minutes before dinner Eric and John were on the terrace waiting\nfor Suzanne. John was talkative, which was just as well, as he might\nhave wondered at his brother's silence. Eric was torn between a desire\nto tell his brother his reluctant suspicions concerning the Medici\nboots and Suzanne and his inclination to leave things alone till the\nboots could be destroyed.\n\nHe said, diffidently, \"John, has Suzanne those--those boots?\"\n\nJohn chuckled. \"Why, yes. I saw them in her room. Do you know she went\ndown to the museum last night and took those boots? It _was_ a light I\nsaw in the museum. It was her light. Suzanne has ideas. Wants to wear\nthe boots just once, she says, to lay the ghost of this\nwhat's-her-name--Maria Modena. Suzanne says she couldn't sleep much\nlast night. Got up early and tried on those boots. Well, I think I'll\ndestroy 'em tomorrow. Uncle's wish, so I'll do it.\"\n\n\"Tried them on, did she? Well, if you should ask me, I'd say that\nhistory of the boots was a bit too exciting for Suzanne. It _was_ a\nhaunting story. Uncle must have swallowed it, hook, line, and sinker,\neh?\"\n\n\"Of course. His letter showed that. But Suzanne lives in the present,\nnot the past, as Uncle did. I suppose Suzanne will wear those boots,\nor she won't feel satisfied. I don't exactly like the idea, I must\nconfess.\"\n\nSomething like an electric shock passed through Eric. He said,\nsomewhat breathlessly, \"I don't think Suzanne ought to have the Medici\nboots.\"\n\nJohn looked at him curiously and laughed. \"I never knew you were\nsuperstitious, Eric. But do you really think----\"\n\n\"I don't know what I think, John. But if she were my wife, I'd take\nthose boots away from her. Uncle may have known what he was talking\nabout.\"\n\n\"Well, I think she's intending to wear them at dinner, so prepare to\nbe dazzled. Here she is, now. Greetings, sweet-heart!\"\n\nSuzanne swept across the terrace, her gown goldly shimmering, pearls\nbound about her head, as Eric had seen her in the dim hour before\ndawn. Again the rows of bracelets were weighting her slim arms. And\nshe wore the Medici boots, the amethyst tips peeping beneath her\nshining dress.\n\nJohn, ever ready for gay clowning, arose and bowed low. \"Hail,\nEmpress! A-ah, the dress you got in Florence on our honeymoon, isn't\nit? And those darned Medici boots!\"\n\nSuzanne unsmilingly extended her hand for him to kiss.\n\nJohn arched an eyebrow, comically. \"What's the matter, honey? Going\nregal on me?\" And retaining her hand, he kissed each of her fingers.\n\nSuzanne snatched away her hand, and the glance she gave her husband\nwas one of venomous hauteur. To Eric she turned a look that was an\nopen caress, leaning toward him, putting a hand on his arm, as he\nstood beside his chair, stern-lipped, with eyes that would not look at\nJohn's hurt bewilderment.\n\nThe three sat down then, in the low wicker chairs, and waited for\ndinner--three people with oddly different emotions. John was hurt,\nslightly impatient with his bride; Eric was furious with Suzanne,\nthough there was in his heart the almost certain knowledge that the\nSuzanne beside them on the terrace was not the Suzanne they knew, but\na cruelly strange woman, the product of a sinister force, unknown and\ncompelling.\n\nNo one, looking on Suzanne's red-lipped and heavy-lidded beauty, could\nmiss the knowledge that here was a woman dangerously subtle, carrying\na power more devastating than the darting lightning that now and then\nshowed itself over the tree-tops of the garden. Eric began to feel\nsomething of this, and there shaped in his mind a wariness, a defense\nagainst this woman who was not Suzanne.\n\n\"No _al fresco_ dining tonight,\" said John, as the darkening sky was\nveined by a sudden spray of blue-green light. \"Rain on the way. Pretty\ngood storm, I'd say.\"\n\n\"I like it,\" replied Suzanne, drawing in a deep breath of the sultry\nair.\n\nJohn laughed. \"Since when, sweet-heart? You usually shake and shiver\nthrough a thunderstorm.\"\n\nSuzanne ignored him. She smiled at Eric and said in a low tone, \"And\nif I should lose my bravery, you would take care of me, wouldn't you,\nEric?\"\n\nBefore Eric could reply, dinner was announced, and he felt a relief\nand also a dread. This dinner was going to be difficult.\n\nJohn offered his arm to his wife, smiling at her, hoping for a smile\nin return, but Suzanne shrugged and said in a caressing voice, \"Eric?\"\n\n\n\nEric could only bow stiffly and offer his arm, while John walked\nslowly beside them, his face thoughtful, his gay spirits gone. During\ndinner, however, he tried to revive the lagging conversation. Suzanne\nspoke in a staccato voice and her choice of words seemed strange to\nEric, almost as though she were translating her own thoughts from a\nforeign tongue.\n\nAnd finally Suzanne's promised dessert came, cool and tempting in its\nsilver dishes. Eric saw a chance to make the talk more natural. He\nsaid, gayly, \"Johnny, your wife's a chef, a famous pastry chef. Behold\nthe work of her hands! What did you say it was, Suzanne?\"\n\n\"This? Oh--I do not know what it is called.\"\n\n\"But this afternoon as you were leaving the kitchen--didn't you say it\nwas almond something or other?\"\n\nShe shook her head, smiling. \"Perhaps it is. I wouldn't know.\"\n\nThe maid had placed the tray with the three silver dishes of dessert\nbefore Suzanne, that she might put on them the final sprinkling of\ndelicate silver candies. Daintily, Suzanne sifted the shining bubbles\nover the fluff of cream. Eric, watching her, felt very little surprize\nwhen he saw Suzanne, with almost legerdemain deftness, sift upon one\ndish a film of pinkish powder which could not be detected after it lay\non the pink cream.\n\nWaiting, he knew not for what moment, he watched Suzanne pass the\nsilver dishes herself, saw her offer the one with the powdered top to\nJohn. And it was then that their attention was attracted by the\nentrance of the maltese kitten. So tiny it was, so brave in its\ncareening totter across the shiny floor, small tail hoisted like a\nsail, that John and Eric laughed aloud.\n\nSuzanne merely glanced down at the little creature and turned away.\nThe kitten, however, came to her chair, put up a tiny paw and caught\nits curved claws in the fragile stuff of Suzanne's gown. Instantly,\nher face became distorted with rage and she kicked out at the kitten,\nsavagely, and with set lips. It seemed to Eric that the amethysts on\nthe Medici boots winked wickedly in the light of the big chandelier.\n\nThe kitten was flung some ten feet away, and lay in a small, panting\nheap.\n\nJohn sprang up. \"Suzanne! How could you?\" He took the kitten in his\narms and soothed it.\n\n\"Why its heart's beating like a trip-hammer,\" he said. \"I don't\nunderstand, Suzanne----\"\n\nAs the kitten grew quiet, he took a large rose-leaf from the\ntable-flowers and spread it with a heaping spoonful of the pink cream\nfrom his dessert. Then he put the kitten on the floor beside it.\n\n\"Here, little one. Lick this up. It's fancy eating. Suzanne's sorry. I\nknow she is.\"\n\nThe kitten, with the greed of its kind, devoured the cream, covering\nits small nose and whiskers with a pinkish film. Suzanne sat back in\nher chair, fingering her bracelets, her eyes on Eric's face. John\nwatched the kitten, and Eric watched, too--watched tensely, for he\nsensed what would happen to it.\n\nThe kitten finished the cream, licked its paws and whiskers and turned\nto walk away. Then it spun around in a frantic convulsion, and in a\nmoment lay dead on its back, its tiny fed tongue protruding, its paws\nrigid.\n\nOutside, the storm glowered, and in the chartreuse light of the forked\nlightning, the great chandelier was turned to a sickly radiance.\nThunder rolled like muffled drums.\n\nSuddenly Suzanne began to laugh, peal after peal of terrible laughter,\nand then, after a glare of lightning, the big chandelier winked out.\nThe room was plunged into stormy darkness, and they could hear the\nrain lashing through the garden to hurl itself against the windows.\n\n\"Don't be frightened, Suzanne.\" It was John's solicitous voice, and it\nwas followed by a quick movement from Suzanne's side of the table.\n\nA sheet of blue-green light illumined the room for an instant, and\nEric saw Suzanne struggling in her husband's arms, one jeweled arm\nuplifted and in her hand a shining dagger.\n\n\n\nWith a bound that was almost involuntary, Eric reached them and struck\nat the knife in Suzanne's hand. It clattered to the floor. And as\nthough the fury of the storm and Suzanne's madness both were spent,\nthe slashing rain and the lightning stopped abruptly, and Suzanne\nceased to struggle.\n\n\"Light the candles, Eric--quickly--on the mantel to your right!\nSuzanne is hurt!\"\n\nIn the candle-light, palely golden and swaying, Eric saw Suzanne\nslumped limply in John's arms. The hem of her golden dress was redly\nwet and one cream-colored little shoe was fast becoming soaked with\nblood from a slash across the instep.\n\n\"Let's get her over to the window-seat, Eric. Do something for\nher!--Oh, sweet-heart, don't moan like that!\" There was no question or\nreproach in John's voice, only compassion.\n\nEric took off his coat, rolled up his sleeves. His mouth was grimly\nset, his hands steady, his voice crisply professional. \"Take off those\nshoes, John. She'll--be herself, then. I mean that she'll be\nSuzanne--not a murderess of the Medicis. Take them off, John! They're\nat the bottom of this.\"\n\n\"You mean----\" John's voice was breathless, his lips trembling.\n\n\"I mean those hellish boots have changed Suzanne from a sweet and\nlovely girl to--well, do as I tell you. I'll be back with gauze and\nsome things I need.\"\n\nWhen Eric hurried back, there were three servants grouped at the\ndining-room door. He spoke to them bruskly and they left, wide-eyed\nand whispering. Eric closed the door.\n\nWhile the wet leaves tapped against the windows and stars struggled\nthrough the clouds, Eric worked, silently, expertly, grimly, by the\nlight of a flashlight held in John's unsteady hands and the light of\nthe flickering candles. The house lights were all snuffed out by the\nstorm.\n\n\"There,\" Eric gave a satisfied grunt. The brothers stood looking at\nSuzanne, who seemed asleep. Her golden dress glimmered in the\ncandle-light and the pearls were slipping from her dark hair. The\nMedici boots lay in a limp and bloody heap in a corner, where Eric had\nflung them.\n\n\"When she awakes, I shouldn't tell her about any of this, if I were\nyou, John.\"\n\n\"There are things you haven't told me, Eric, aren't there? Things\nabout--the Medici boots?\"\n\nEric looked steadily at his brother. \"Yes, old fellow; and after I've told\nyou, those boots must be destroyed. We'll burn them before this night is\nover. We mustn't move her now. We'll go out on the terrace--it's wet\nthere, but the air is fresh. Did you smell--something peculiar?\"\n\nFor, as they passed the corner where the Medici boots lay slashed and\nbloody, Eric could have sworn that there came to him a horrid odor,\nfetid, hotly offensive--the odor of iniquity and ancient bloody death.\n\n",
