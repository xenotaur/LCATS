    "body": "_Sure I'm a Nilly, and I've died seven times, always in the blackness\nof the outer reaches, and I'm not alone, although there aren't very\nmany of us, never were._\n\nIt made sense. Interstellar was new and they wanted him on the ship\nbecause he was a trained observer. They wanted facts, not gibberish.\nBut to ask a man to give up two years of his life--well, that was\nasking a lot. Two years in a sardine can. Still, it had an appeal Keith\nEllason knew he couldn't deny, a newsman's joy of the clean beat, a\nplanetary system far afield, a closeup view of the universe, history in\nthe making.\n\nInterstellar Chief Rexroad knocked the dottle from his pipe in a tray,\nsaying, \"Transworld Press is willing to let you have a leave of\nabscence, if you're interested.\"\n\nHe knew Secretary Phipps from years of contacting, and now Phipps said,\n\"Personally, I don't want to see anybody else on the job. You've got a\nfine record in this sort of thing.\"\n\nKeith Ellason smiled, but just barely. \"You should have called me for\nthe first trip.\"\n\nPhipps nodded. \"I wish we had had you on the _Weblor I_.\"\n\n\"Crewmen,\" Rexroad said, \"make poor reporters.\"\n\nThe _Weblor I_ had taken off on the first trip to Antheon five years\nbefore with a thousand families, reached the planet with less than five\nhundred surviving colonists. Upon the return to Earth a year later, the\ncrew's report of suffering and chaos during the year's outgoing voyage\nwas twisted, distorted and fragmentary. Ellason remembered it well. The\ndecision of Interstellar was that the colonists started a revolution\nfar out in space, that it was fanned by the ignorance of Captain\nSessions in dealing with such matters.\n\n\"Space affects men in a peculiar way,\" Phipps said. \"We have conquered\nthe problem of small groups in space--witness the discovery of\nAntheon, for example--but when there are large groups, control is more\ndifficult.\"\n\n\"Sessions,\" Rexroad said, \"was a bully. The trouble started at about\nthe halfway point. It ended with passengers engaging in open warfare\nwith each other and the crew. Sessions was lucky to escape with his\nlife.\"\n\n\"As I recall,\" Ellason said, \"there was something about stunners.\"\n\nPhipps rubbed his chin. \"No weapons were allowed on the ship, but you\nmust remember the colonists were selected for their intelligence and\nresourcefulness. They utilized these attributes to set up weapon shops\nto arm themselves.\"\n\n\"The second trip is history,\" Rexroad said. \"And a puzzle.\"\n\n\n\nEllason nodded. \"The ship disappeared.\"\n\n\"Yes. We gave control to the colonists.\"\n\n\"Assuming no accident in space,\" Phipps said, \"it was a wrong decision.\nThey probably took over the ship.\"\n\n\"And now,\" Ellason said, \"you're going to try again.\"\n\nRexroad said very gravely, \"We've got the finest captain in\nInterplanetary. Harvey Branson. No doubt you've heard of him. He's\nspent his life in our own system, and he's handpicking his own crew. We\nhave also raised prerequisites for applicants. We don't think anything\nis going to happen, but if it does, we want to get an impersonal,\nunprejudiced view. That's where you come in. You do the observing, the\nreporting. We'll evaluate it on your return.\"\n\n\"If I return,\" said Ellason.\n\n\"I suppose that's problematical,\" Phipps said, \"but I think you will.\nCaptain Branson and his fifty crewmen want to return as badly as you\ndo.\" He grinned. \"You can write that novel you're always talking about\non your return trip on the _Weblor II_.\"\n\n_Being a Nilly is important, probably as important as running the ship,\nand I think it is this thought that keeps us satisfied, willing to be\nwhat we are._\n\n\n\nThe _Weblor II_ had been built in space, as had its predecessor, the\n_Weblor I_, at a tremendous cost. Basically, it was an instrument\nwhich would open distant vistas to colonization, reducing the\nshoulder-to-shoulder pressure of a crowded solar system. A gigantic,\nhollow spike, the ship would never land anywhere, but would circle\nAntheon as it circled Earth, shuttling its cargo and passengers to the\npromised land, the new frontier. A space-borne metropolis, it would\nbe the home for three thousand persons outward bound, only the crew\non the return trip. It was equipped with every conceivable facility\nand comfort--dining rooms, assembly hall, individual and family\ncompartments, recreation areas, swimming pool, library, theater.\nNothing had been overlooked.\n\nThe captain's briefing room was crowded, the air was heavy with the\nbreathing of so many men, and the ventilators could not quite clear the\nair of tobacco smoke that drifted aimlessly here and there before it\nwas caught and whisked away.\n\nIn the tradition of newspaperman and observer, Keith Ellason tried\nto be as inconspicuous as possible, pressing against a bulkhead, but\nCaptain Branson's eyes sought his several times as Branson listened\nto final reports from his engineers, record keepers, fuel men,\ncomputermen, and all the rest. He grunted his approval or disapproval,\nmade a suggestion here, a restriction there. There was no doubt that\nBranson was in charge, yet there was a human quality about him that\nEllason liked. The captain's was a lean face, well tanned, and his eyes\nwere chunks of blue.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" Branson said at last, as Ellason knew he would, \"I want\nto introduce Keith Ellason, whose presence Interstellar has impressed\nupon us. On loan from Transworld, he will have an observer status.\" He\nintroduced him to the others. All of them seemed friendly; Ellason\nthought it was a good staff.\n\nBranson detained him after the others had gone. \"One thing, Mr.\nEllason. To make it easier for you, I suggest you think of this journey\nstrictly from the observer viewpoint. There will be no story for\nTransworld at the end.\"\n\nEllason was startled. While he had considered the possibility, he had\nnot dwelt on it. Now it loomed large in his mind. \"I don't understand,\nCaptain Branson. It seems to me--\"\n\n\"Let me put it differently. Let me say that you will not understand why\nI say that until the journey ends.\" He smiled. \"Perhaps I shouldn't\nhave mentioned it.\"\n\n\n\nEllason left the captain's quarters with an odd taste in his mouth. Now\nwhy had Branson said that? Why hadn't Rexroad or Phipps said something,\nif it was important?\n\nHe made himself comfortable in his seven-foot-by-seven-foot cubicle,\nwhich is to say he dropped on his bed, found it more comfortable than\nhe thought it would be, put his arms behind his head, stared at the\nceiling. Metal walls, no windows, one floor vent, one ceiling vent,\nand a solitary ceiling molding tube-light. This would be his home for\na year, just as there were homes like it for three thousand others,\nexcept that the family rooms would be larger. His quarters were near\nthe front of the spike near the officers' quarters.\n\nHe felt rather than heard the dull rumble. It was a sound he knew would\nbe with him for two years--one year going and one year returning.\n\nHe looked at his watch, picked up his notebook and made an entry. The\nship right now would be slipping ever so slowly away from Earth. He got\nup. He'd have to go forward to the observation dome to see that. Last\nview of Earth for two years.\n\n_The penetration of space by large groups is the coming out from under\nthe traditions of thousands of years, and as these planet-orginated\nrules fall away, the floundering group seeks a new control, for they\nare humanity adrift, rudderless, for whom the stars are no longer\nbearings but nonexistent things, and values are altered if they are not\nshown the way._\n\nThe theft of Carver Janssen's attache case occurred on the thirty-first\nday out. In Ellason's mind the incident, though insignificant from the\nstandpoint of the ship as a whole, could very well be the cause of\ndissension later on. His notes covering it were therefore very thorough.\n\nJanssen's case contained vegetable and flower seeds--thousands of\nthem, according to the Captain's Bulletin, the ship's daily newsletter\nwhich went to all hands and passengers. In the Bulletin the captain\nappealed to the thief to return the case to Mr. Janssen. He said it\nwas significant that all en route had passed stability tests, and that\nit was to the ship's discredit that someone with criminal tendencies\nshould have been permitted aboard.\n\nEllason had to smile at that. What did Captain Branson think of those\ncolonists who killed each other on the _Weblor I_? They had passed\nstability tests too. This, then, was what happened when you took three\nthousand strangers and stuck them in a can for a year.\n\n\n\nWhen Ellason saw Branson about it, the captain said, \"Of course I\nrealize it takes only a little thing like this to set things off. I\nknow people get tired of seeing each other, playing the same tapes,\nlooking at the stars from the observation dome, walking down the same\ncorridors, reading the same books, eating the same meals, though God\nknows we try to vary it as much as we can. Space creates rough edges.\nBut the point is, we know all this, and knowing it, we shouldn't let it\nhappen. We've got to find that thief.\"\n\n\"What would he want seeds for? Have you thought of that?\"\n\n\"Of course. They'd have real value on Antheon.\"\n\nEllason sought out Carver Janssen. He was a middle-aged man with a\ntired face and sad eyes. He said, \"Now what am I going to Antheon\nfor? I could only take along so much baggage and I threw out some\ncomfort items to make room for the seeds. I'm a horticulturist, and\nInterstellar asked me to go along. But what use am I now? Where am\nI going to get seeds like those? Do you know how long it took me to\ncollect them? They're not ordinary seeds, Mr. Ellason.\"\n\nThere was an appeal from Janssen in the next day's newsletter\ndescribing the seeds, telling of their value, and requesting their\nreturn in the interests of the Antheon colony and of humanity.\n\nOn the thirty-fourth day a witness turned up who said he had seen a\nman emerging from Janssen's compartment with the black case. \"I didn't\nthink anything of it at the time,\" Jamieson Dievers said.\n\nBranson asked him to describe the man.\n\n\"Oh, he was about six feet tall, stocky build, and he wore a red rubber\nmask that covered his head completely.\"\n\n\"Didn't you think that was important?\" Branson asked in an outraged\nvoice. \"A man wearing a red mask?\"\n\nDievers shrugged. \"This is a spaceship. How would I know whether a red\nmask--or a blue or green one--does or doesn't belong on a spaceship?\"\n\nAlthough Dievers' account appeared in the newsletter, it was largely\ndiscounted.\n\n\"If it is true,\" Branson told Ellason, \"the theft must be the work of\na psychotic. But I don't believe Jamieson Dievers. It may well be he's\nthe psychotic.\" He snorted. \"Red rubber mask! I think I'll have Dievers\nput through psychiatry.\"\n\nAttendant to taking notes on this incident, Ellason noted a strange\nthing. Janssen lived in that part of the ship known as the First\nQuadrant, and those who lived in that quadrant--more than seven hundred\nmen, women and children--felt that the thief must surely live in\nQuadrant Two or Four. Elias Cromley, who had the compartment next to\nJanssen's, sounded the consensus when he said, \"Surely a man wouldn't\nsteal from his own quadrant, now would he, Mr. Ellason?\"\n\nAnd so, Ellason observed in his notebook, are wars created.\n\n_Seen in space, stars are unmoving, silent, sterile bright eyes ever\nwatchful and accusing. To men unused to it, such a sight numbs,\ncompresses, stultifies. He introduces a countermeasure, proof he\nexists, which is any overt act, sometimes violent._\n\n\n\nOn the forty-fifth day June Failright, the young wife of one of the\npassenger meteorologists, ran screaming down one of the long corridors\nof the Third Quadrant. She told the captain she had been attacked in\nher compartment while her husband was in the ship's library. She was\ntaken to one of the ship's doctors, who confirmed it.\n\nShe said the culprit was a husky man wearing a red rubber mask, and\nthough her description of what he had done did not appear in the story\nin the newsletter, it lost no time in penetrating every compartment of\nthe ship.\n\nEllason was present when a delegation from the Third Quadrant called on\nCaptain Branson, demanding action.\n\nBranson remained seated behind his desk, unperturbed, saying, \"I have\nno crewmen to spare for police duty.\"\n\nThe delegation commenced speaking vehemently, to be quieted by\nBranson's raised hand.\n\n\"I sympathize,\" Branson said, \"but it is up to each quadrant to deal\nwith its problems, whatever they may be. My job is to get us to\nAntheon.\"\n\nThe group left in a surly mood.\n\n\"You wonder at my reluctance, Mr. Ellason,\" Captain Branson said. \"But\nsuppose I assign the crew to patrol duties, the culprit isn't caught,\nand further incidents occur. What then? It soon becomes the crew's\nfault. And soon the colonists will begin thinking these things might be\nthe crew's doing in the first place.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Ellason said, \"but what if the intruder is a crewman?\"\n\n\"I know my men,\" Branson said flatly.\n\n\"You could have a shake-down for the mask and the seed case.\"\n\n\"Do you think it is a member of the crew?\" Branson's eyes were bright.\n\"No, I trust my men. I won't violate that trust.\"\n\nEllason left, feeling uneasy. If he were Branson, he'd initiate an\ninvestigation, if nothing else than to prove the crew guiltless. Why\ncouldn't Branson see the wisdom of setting an example for the colonists?\n\n_As a Nilly, I knew that space breeds hate. There is a seed of\nmalevolence in every man. It sometimes blossoms out among the stars. On\nthe_ Weblor II _it was ready for ripening._\n\nRaymond Palugger was killed in the ship's hospital on the sixty-first\nday. Palugger, a Fourth Quadrant passenger, had complained of feeling\nill, had been hospitalized with a diagnosis of ileus. He had put his\nmoney belt in the drawer of the small stand beside his bed. A man\nin a red mask was seen hurrying from the hospital area, and a staff\ninvestigation revealed that Palugger had died trying to prevent the\ntheft of the belt.\n\nCaptain Branson did not wait for the newsletter. Through the ship's\nspeaker system, he reported that Palugger had a fortune in credits\nin the belt and had died of a severe beating. He said that since the\nincident occurred in the staff section of the ship, his crew would be\nforced to submit to a thorough inspection in an effort to find the\nmask, the seed case, the money and the man.\n\n\"I will not countenance such an act by a crewman,\" Branson said. \"If\nand when he is found, he will be severely dealt with. But he might not\nbe a member of the crew. I am ordering an assembly of all passengers at\nnine tomorrow morning in the auditorium. I will speak to you all then.\"\n\n\n\nFaces were angry, tongues were sharp at the meeting, eyes suspicious\nand tempers short. Above it all was the overpowering presence of\nCaptain Branson speaking to them.\n\n\"It is not my desire to interfere in passenger affairs,\" he said.\n\"Insofar as the ship is concerned, it is my duty to make certain no\ncrewman is guilty. This I am doing. But my crew is not and cannot be\na police force for you. It is up to you people to police and protect\nyourselves.\"\n\n\"How can we protect ourselves without stunners?\" one colonist called\nout.\n\n\"Has Red Mask a gun?\" Branson retorted. \"It seems to me you have a\nbetter weapon than any gun.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"This ship is only so wide, so long and so deep. If every inch is\nsearched, you'll find your man. He has to be somewhere aboard.\"\n\nThe colonists quieted. Benjamin Simpson, one of the older men, was\nelected president of the newly formed Quadrant Council. One man from\neach of the quadrants was named to serve under him. Each of these men\nin turn selected five others from his own group.\n\nThose assembled waited in the hall while each team of six inspected\nthe compartments of the others. These compartments were then locked,\neveryone returned to his compartment, and the larger search was\nconducted. It took twenty hours.\n\nNo mask was found. No mask, no case, no money, no man.\n\nThe captain reported that his search had been equally fruitless.\nAt another assembly the following day it was decided to make the\ninspection teams permanent, to await further moves on the part of Red\nMask. The Quadrant Council held periodic meetings to set up a method of\ntrial for him when he was caught. It was all recorded in the newsletter\nand by Keith Ellason.\n\n_We Nillys know about hate and about violence. We know too that where\nthere is hate there is violence, and where there is violence there is\ndeath._\n\n\n\nDuring sleep time on the seventy-ninth day Barbara Stoneman, awakened\nby a strange sound, sat up in the bed of her compartment to find a\nman in a red mask in her room. Her cries brought neighbors into the\ncorridor. The flight of the man was witnessed by many, and several men\ntried to stop him. But the intruder was light on his feet and fast. He\nescaped.\n\nThe Quadrant Council confronted the captain, demanding weapons.\n\n\"Are you out of your minds?\" Branson exclaimed.\n\nTom Tilbury, Fourth Quadrant leader, said, \"We want to set up a police\nforce, Captain. We want stunners.\"\n\n\"There's no law against it,\" Branson said, \"but it's a rule of mine\nthat no weapons are to be issued en route.\"\n\n\"If we had had a gun, we'd have got Red Mask,\" Tilbury said.\n\n\"And I might have a murder on my conscience.\"\n\nTilbury said, \"We've also thought of that. Suppose you supply us with\nhalf-power stunners? That way we can stun but not kill.\"\n\nThey got their guns. Now there were twenty-four policemen on duty in\nthe corridors--eight on at a time. Ellason observed that for the first\ntime the passengers seemed relaxed.\n\nLet Red Mask move against armed men, they said.\n\nYeah, let him see what happens now.\n\nRed Mask did.\n\n\n\nOn the 101st day he was seen in a corridor in Quadrant Four. Emil\nPierce, policeman on duty, managed to squeeze off several shots at his\nretreating figure.\n\nRed Mask was seen again on the 120th day, on the 135th day, and the\n157th day. He was seen, shot at, but not hit. He was also unable to\ncommit any crime.\n\nWe've got him on the run, the colonists said.\n\nHe's afraid to do anything, now that we've got police protection, they\nsaid smugly.\n\nThe Quadrant Council congratulated itself. The passengers were proud\nof themselves. A special congratulatory message from Captain Branson\nappeared one day in the Bulletin newsletter.\n\nThe colonists settled down to living out the rest of the voyage until\nthe landing on Antheon.\n\nBut on the 170th day calamity struck. Red Mask appropriated one of the\nstunners, made his way down one whole corridor section in Quadrant Two,\nput occupants to sleep as he went, taking many articles of value and\nleaving disorder behind.\n\nEllason interviewed as many victims as he could, noted it all in\nhis book. The things taken were keepsakes, photographs and items of\npersonal value. It seemed to be the work of a madman. If Red Mask\nwanted to make everyone furious, he certainly succeeded.\n\n\"What does he want that stuff for?\" Casey Stromberg, a passenger\ndoctor, asked. \"I can see him taking my narcotics, my doctor's kit--but\nmy dead wife's picture? That I don't understand.\"\n\nIt was the same with others. \"The man's insane, Mr. Ellason. Positively\ninsane.\" Many people said it.\n\nThe council issued orders that all passengers from now on would be\nrequired to lock their compartments at all times. More guns were\nobtained from the captain. More policemen were appointed.\n\nEllason was busy noting it all in his book. It became filled with\njottings about innocent people being accidentally stunned when\ntrigger-happy policemen thought their movements suspicious, about one\nman's suspicion of another and the ensuing search of compartments,\npeople who saw Red Mask here, saw him there. Hardly a day went by\nwithout some new development.\n\n\"Oh, yes, Mr. Ellason, we're going to get him,\" said Tilbury, now chief\nof police, cracking his knuckles, his eyes glowing at the thought.\n\"We're bound to get him. We've got things worked out to the finest\ndetail. He won't be able to get through our fingers now. Just let him\nmake so much as a move.\"\n\n\"And what will you do when you get him?\"\n\n\"Kill him,\" Tilbury said, licking his lips, his eyes glowing more\nfiercely than ever.\n\n\"Without a trial?\"\n\n\"Oh, there'll be a trial, Mr. Ellason, but you don't think any jury'd\nlet him live after all the things he's done, do you?\"\n\n\n\nRed Mask was stunned in Quadrant Four in a corridor by a policeman\nnamed Terryl Placer on the 201st day. The criminal was carried to the\nassembly room surrounded by guards, for he surely would have been\nmauled, if not killed, by angry colonists who crowded around. In the\nassembly hall his mask was whipped off. The crowd gasped. Nobody knew\nhim.\n\nEllason's first thought was that he must be a stowaway, but then he\nremembered the face, and Captain Branson, who came to have a look at\nhim, unhappily admitted the man was a member of the crew. His name was\nHarrel Critten and he was a record keeper third class.\n\n\"Well, Critten,\" Branson roared at him, \"what have you got to say for\nyourself?\"\n\n\"Go to hell,\" Critten said quietly. As if it were an afterthought, he\nspat at the captain.\n\nBranson looked as if he were going to kill the man himself right there\nand then.\n\nIt was a long trial--from the 220th to the 241st day--and there didn't\nseem to be much doubt about the outcome, for Critten didn't help his\nown cause during any of it.\n\nLemuel Tarper, who was appointed prosecutor, asked him, \"What did you\ndo with the loot, Critten?\"\n\nCritten looked him square in the eye and said, \"I threw it out one of\nthe escape chutes. Does that answer your question?\"\n\n\"Threw it away?\" Tarper and the crowd were incredulous.\n\n\"Sure,\" Critten said. \"You colonists got the easy life as passengers,\njust sitting around. I had to work my head off keeping records for you\nlazy bastards.\"\n\nThe verdict was, of course, death.\n\nThey executed Harrel Critten on the morning of the 270th day with\nblasts from six stunners supplied with full power. It was witnessed\nby a great crowd in the assembly hall. A detail from the ship's crew\ndisposed of his body through a chute.\n\nIt was all duly recorded in Keith Ellason's notebooks.\n\n_Dying is easy for a Nilly. Especially if it's arranged for beforehand,\nwhich it always is._\n\n\n\nThe _Weblor II_ was only one day out of orbit when Captain Branson sent\nfor Ellason and introduced him to the executed man.\n\n\"Hello,\" Critten said, grinning from ear to ear.\n\n\"I figured as much,\" Ellason said. \"I've been doing a lot of thinking.\"\n\n\"You're perhaps a little too good as an observer,\" Branson said. \"Or\nmaybe it was because you really weren't one of the colonists. But no\nmatter, Critten did a good job. He was trained by an old friend of mine\nfor this job, Gelthorpe Nill. Nill used to be in counter-espionage when\nthere were wars.\"\n\n\"You were excellent,\" Ellason said.\n\n\"Can't say I enjoyed the role,\" said Critten, \"but I think it saved\nlives.\"\n\n\"Let me get this straight. Interstellar thought that it was idleness\nand boredom that caused the killings on the _Weblor I_, so they had you\ntrained to be a scapegoat. Is that right?\"\n\nCritten nodded. \"When great numbers are being transported, they are apt\nto magnify each little event because so little happens. It was my job\nto see that they directed none of their venom against each other or the\ncrew, only toward me.\"\n\nBranson smiled. \"It made the time pass quickly and interestingly for\nthe passengers.\"\n\n\"To say nothing of me,\" Critten said.\n\n\"And you, Mr. Ellason, were along to observe it all,\" Captain Branson\nput in. \"Interstellar wanted an accurate picture of this. If it worked,\nthey told me they'd use it on other trips to Antheon.\"\n\nEllason nodded. \"No time for brooding, for differences of opinion on\nsmall matters. Just time to hate Mr. Critten. Unanimously.\"\n\n\"Probably,\" Critten said, \"you are wondering about the execution.\"\n\n\"Naturally.\"\n\n\"We removed the charges before the guns were used.\"\n\n\"And Carver Janssen's case?\"\n\n\"He'll get it back when he's shuttled to Antheon. And all the other\nitems will be returned. They're all tagged with their owner's names.\nCaptain Branson will say they were found somewhere on the ship. You\nsee, I was a liar.\"\n\n\"How about that assault on June Failright?\"\n\nCritten grinned again. \"She played right into our hands. She ran out\ninto the hall claiming I'd attacked her, which I did not. She was\ncertainly amazed when the ship's physicians agreed with her. Of course\nCaptain Branson told them to do that.\"\n\n\"And the murder?\"\n\n\"Raymond Palugger died in the hospital all right, but he died from\nhis illness on the operating table. We turned it into an advantage by\nmaking it look suspicious.\"\n\nEllason brightened. \"And by that time everybody was seeing Red Mask\neverywhere and the colonists organized against him.\"\n\n\"Gave them something to do,\" Branson said.\n\n\"Every time things got dull, I livened them up. I got a stunner and\nrobbed along the corridor. That really stirred them. Lucky nobody got\nhurt during any of it, including that Stoneman woman. I was trying to\nrob her when she woke up.\"\n\n\n\nBranson cleared his throat. \"Ah, Ellason about that story. You\nunderstand you can't write it, don't you?\"\n\nEllason said regretfully that he did understand.\n\n\"The colonists will never know the truth,\" Branson went on. \"There will\nbe other ships outward bound.\"\n\nCritten sighed. \"And I'll have to be caught again.\"\n\n_Yes, we're anonymous, nameless, we Nillys, for that's what we call\neach other, and are a theme, with variations, in the endless stretches\nof deep space, objects of hatred and contempt, professional heels,\ndying once a trip when the time is ripe, antidote to boredom, and we'll\nply our trade, our little tragedies, on a thousand ships bringing\nhumanity to new worlds._",
