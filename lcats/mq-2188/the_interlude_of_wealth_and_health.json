Greg.\n\n\n\n\nEarly in the craft year which began on 19 July 1557, and was the first\nof the chartered existence of the Stationers' Company, John Waley, or\nWally, entered what was no doubt the present play on the Register along\nwith several other works. The entry runs as follows:\n\n     To master John wally these bokes Called Welth and helthe/the\n     treatise of the ffrere and the boye / stans puer ad mensam another\n     of youghte charyte and humylyte an a b c for cheldren in englesshe\n     with syllabes also a boke called an hundreth mery tayles ij^s\n     [Arber's Transcript, I. 75.]\n\nThat Waley printed an edition is therefore to be presumed, but it does\nnot necessarily follow that the extant copy, which though perfect bears\nneither date nor printer's name, ever belonged to it. Indeed, a\ncomparison with a number of works to which he did affix his name\nsuggests grave doubts on the subject. Though not a high-class printer,\nthere seems no reason to ascribe to him a piece of work which for\nbadness alike of composition and press-work appears to be unique among\nthe dramatic productions of the sixteenth century.\n\n'Wealth and health' appears among the titles in the list of plays\nappended to the edition of Goffe's _Careless Shepherdess_, printed for\nRogers and Ley in 1656. The entry was repeated with the designation\n'C[omedy].' in Archer's list of the same year, and, without the\naddition, in those of Kirkman in 1661 and 1671. In 1691 Langbaine wrote\n'_Wealth and Health_, a Play of which I can give no Account.' Gildon has\nno further information to offer, nor have any of his immediate\nfollowers. Chetwood, in 1752, classes it among 'Plays Wrote by Anonymous\nAuthors in the 16th [by which he means the seventeenth] Century,' calls\nit 'an Interlude' and dates it 1602. This invention was only copied in\nthose lists which depended directly on Chetwood's, such as the\n_Playhouse Pocket-Companion_ of 1779. Meanwhile, in his _Companion to\nthe Play-House_ of 1764, D.E. Baker, relying upon Coxeter's notes, gave\nan essentially accurate description of the piece, except that he\nasserted it to be 'full of Sport and mery Pastyme,' and described it as\nan octavo. This entry has been copied by subsequent bibliographers, none\nof whom have seen the original.\n\nThe play was among those discovered in Ireland in the spring of 1906 and\nsold at Sotheby's on 30 June, when it was purchased for the British\nMuseum at the price of one hundred and ninety-five pounds. Its\npress-mark is C. 34. i. 25.\n\nThe extremely careless typography of the original makes the task of\nreprinting a difficult one. Ordinary misprints abound, and these have\nbeen scrupulously retained, a list of irregularities being added below.\nIt has, however, proved impossible to arrive at any satisfactory method\nof distinguishing between 'n' and 'u.' In the first hundred lines, which\nare by no means the worst printed, there are thirty-two cases in which\nthe letter is indistinguishable, eighteen cases of an apparent 'u' which\nshould be 'n,' and seven cases of an apparent 'n' which should be 'u.'\nWhen it is further remembered that there are few cases in which it is\npossible to say for certain that a letter really is what it appears to\nbe, and none in which it may not be turned, some idea of the difficulty\nin the way of reprinting will be obtained. To have followed the original\nin this matter would have been to introduce another misprint into at\nleast every fourth line, while even so several hundred cases would have\nremained which could only have been decided according to the apparent\nsense of the passage. The only rational course was to treat the letters\nas indistinguishable throughout, and to print in each instance\nwhichever the sense seemed to require. Again, as the superscript letters\n'c,' 'e,' 't,' are seldom distinguishable, the printer has been given\nthe benefit of the doubt. Another difficulty arose in connection with\nthe speakers' names. In the original these have often dropt from their\nproper places, which can now only be ascertained from the sense and the\nnot very regular indentation. With some hesitation it has been decided\nto restore them to the positions they should apparently occupy, noting\nall cases in which they are a line or more out in the original. Lastly\nit may be remarked that in the speeches which aim at imitating foreign\nlanguages the apparent readings of the very indistinct original have\nbeen scrupulously reproduced, and no attempt has been made, even in the\nsubjoined list, to suggest any corrections.\n\nIn the last sheet some of the pages are cropt at the foot. In most cases\nnothing more than the catchword has disappeared, and although between\nlines 768 and 769 something seems to be lost, it is doubtful whether\nthis is due to the cropping, since D1^v has already one line too many.\n\nThe original is printed in the ordinary black letter of the period, of\nthe body known as English (20 ll. = 94 mm.).\n\n\nIrregular and Doubtful Readings.\n\nTit. att his\n5. tcowe\n7. fleepe(?)\n13. nof\n24.
