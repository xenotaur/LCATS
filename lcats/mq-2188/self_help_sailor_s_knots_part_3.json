    "body": "1909\n\n\n\nSELF-HELP\n\n\nThe night-watchman sat brooding darkly over life and its troubles.  A\nshooting corn on the little toe of his left foot, and a touch of liver,\ndue, he was convinced, to the unlawful cellar work of the landlord of the\nQueen's Head, had induced in him a vein of profound depression.  A\ndiscarded boot stood by his side, and his gray-stockinged foot protruded\nover the edge of the jetty until a passing waterman gave it a playful rap\nwith his oar.  A subsequent inquiry as to the price of pigs' trotters\nfell on ears rendered deaf by suffering.\n\n\"I might 'ave expected it,\" said the watchman, at last.  \"I done that\nman--if you can call him a man--a kindness once, and this is my reward\nfor it.  Do a man a kindness, and years arterwards 'e comes along and\nhits you over your tenderest corn with a oar.\"\n\nHe took up his boot, and, inserting his foot with loving care, stooped\ndown and fastened the laces.\n\nDo a man a kindness, he continued, assuming a safer posture, and 'e tries\nto borrow money off of you; do a woman a kindness and she thinks you want\ntr marry 'er; do an animal a kindness and it tries to bite you--same as a\nhorse bit a sailorman I knew once, when 'e sat on its head to 'elp it get\nup.  He sat too far for'ard, pore chap.\n\nKindness never gets any thanks.  I remember a man whose pal broke 'is leg\nwhile they was working together unloading a barge; and he went off to\nbreak the news to 'is pal's wife.  A kind-'earted man 'e was as ever you\nsee, and, knowing 'ow she would take on when she 'eard the news, he told\nher fust of all that 'er husband was killed.  She took on like a mad\nthing, and at last, when she couldn't do anything more and 'ad quieted\ndown a bit, he told 'er that it was on'y a case of a broken leg, thinking\nthat 'er joy would be so great that she wouldn't think anything of that.\nHe 'ad to tell her three times afore she understood 'im, and then,\ninstead of being thankful to 'im for 'is thoughtfulness, she chased him\n'arf over Wapping with a chopper, screaming with temper.\n\nI remember Ginger Dick and Peter Russet trying to do old Sam Small a\nkindness one time when they was 'aving a rest ashore arter a v'y'ge.\nThey 'ad took a room together as usual, and for the fust two or three\ndays they was like brothers.  That couldn't last, o' course, and Sam was\nso annoyed one evening at Ginger's suspiciousness by biting a 'arf-dollar\nSam owed 'im and finding it was a bad 'un, that 'e went off to spend the\nevening all alone by himself.\n\nHe felt a bit dull at fust, but arter he had 'ad two or three 'arf-pints\n'e began to take a brighter view of things.  He found a very nice, cosey\nlittle public-'ouse he hadn't been in before, and, arter getting two and\nthreepence and a pint for the 'arf-dollar with Ginger's tooth-marks on,\nhe began to think that the world wasn't 'arf as bad a place as people\ntried to make out.\n\nThere was on'y one other man in the little bar Sam was in--a tall, dark\nchap, with black side-whiskers and spectacles, wot kept peeping round the\npartition and looking very 'ard at everybody that came in.\n\n\"I'm just keeping my eye on 'em, cap'n,\" he ses to Sam, in a low voice.\n\n\"Ho!\" ses Sam.\n\n\"They don't know me in this disguise,\" ses the dark man, \"but I see as\n'ow you spotted me at once.  Anybody 'ud have a 'ard time of it to\ndeceive you; and then they wouldn't gain nothing by it.\"\n\n\"Nobody ever 'as yet,\" ses Sam, smiling at 'im.\n\n\"And nobody ever will,\" ses the dark man, shaking his 'cad; \"if they was\nall as fly as you, I might as well put the shutters up.  How did you twig\nI was a detective officer, cap'n?\"\n\nSam, wot was taking a drink, got some beer up 'is nose with surprise.\n\n\"That's my secret,\" he ses, arter the tec 'ad patted 'im on the back and\nbrought 'im round.\n\n\"You're a marvel, that's wot you are,\" ses the tec, shaking his 'ead.\n\"Have one with me.\"\n\nSam said he didn't mind if 'e did, and arter drinking each other's\nhealths very perlite 'e ordered a couple o' twopenny smokes, and by way\nof showing off paid for 'em with 'arf a quid.\n\n\"That's right, ain't it?\" ses the barmaid, as he stood staring very 'ard\nat the change.  \"I ain't sure about that 'arf-crown, now I come to look\nat it; but it's the one you gave me.\"\n\nPore Sam, with a tec standing alongside of 'im, said it was quite right,\nand put it into 'is pocket in a hurry and began to talk to the tec as\nfast as he could about a murder he 'ad been reading about in the paper\nthat morning.  They went and sat down by a comfortable little fire that\nwas burning in the bar, and the tec told 'im about a lot o' murder cases\nhe 'ad been on himself.\n\n\"I'm down 'ere now on special work,\" he ses, \"looking arter sailormen.\"\n\n\"Wot ha' they been doing?\"  ses Sam.\n\n\"When I say looking arter, I mean protecting 'em,\" ses the tec.  \"Over\nand over agin some pore feller, arter working 'ard for months at sea,\ncomes 'ome with a few pounds in 'is pocket and gets robbed of the lot.\nThere's a couple o' chaps down 'ere I'm told off to look arter special,\nbut it's no good unless I can catch 'em red-'anded.\"\n\n\"Red-'anded?\" ses Sam.\n\n\"With their hands in the chap's pockets, I mean,\" ses the tec.\n\nSam gave a shiver.  \"Somebody had their 'ands in my pockets once,\" he\nses.  \"Four pun ten and some coppers they got.\"\n\n\"Wot was they like?\" ses the tee, starting.\n\nSam shook his 'ead.  \"They seemed to me to be all hands, that's all I\nknow about 'em,\" he ses.  \"Arter they 'ad finished they leaned me up agin\nthe dock wall an' went off.\"\n\n\"It sounds like 'em,\" ses the tec, thoughtfully.  \"It was Long Pete and\nFair Alf, for a quid; that's the two I'm arter.\"\n\nHe put his finger in 'is weskit-pocket.  \"That's who I am,\" he ses,\n'anding Sam a card; \"Detective-Sergeant Cubbins.  If you ever get into\nany trouble at any time, you come to me.\"\n\nSam said 'e would, and arter they had 'ad another drink together the tec\nshifted 'is seat alongside of 'im and talked in his ear.\n\n\"If I can nab them two chaps I shall get promotion,\" he ses; \"and it's a\nfi'-pun note to anybody that helps me.  I wish I could persuade you to.\"\n\n\"'Ow's it to be done?\" ses Sam, looking at 'im.\n\n\"I want a respectable-looking seafaring man,\" ses the tec, speaking very\nslow; \"that's you.  He goes up Tower Hill to-morrow night at nine\no'clock, walking very slow and very unsteady on 'is pins, and giving my\ntwo beauties the idea that 'e is three sheets in the wind.  They come up\nand rob 'im, and I catch them red-'anded.  I get promotion, and you get a\nfiver.\"\n\n\"But 'ow do you know they'll be there?\" ses Sam, staring at 'im.\n\nMr. Cubbins winked at 'im and tapped 'is nose.\n\n\"We 'ave to know a good deal in our line o' business,\" he ses.\n\n\"Still,\" ses Sam, \"I don't see----\"\n\n\"Narks,\" says the tec; \"coppers' narks.  You've 'eard of them, cap'n?\nNow, look 'ere.  Have you got any money?\"\n\n\"I got a matter o' twelve quid or so,\" ses Sam, in a of hand way.\n\n\"The very thing,\" says the tec.  \"Well, to-morrow night you put that in\nyour pocket, and be walking up Tower Hill just as the clock strikes nine.\nI promise you you'll be robbed afore two minutes past, and by two and a\n'arf past I shall 'ave my hands on both of 'em.  Have all the money in\none pocket, so as they can get it neat and quick, in case they get\ninterrupted.  Better still, 'ave it in a purse; that makes it easier to\nbring it 'ome to 'em.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't it be enough if they stole the purse?\" ses Sam.  \"I should feel\nsafer that way, too.\"\n\nMr. Cubbins shook his 'ead, very slow and solemn.  \"That wouldn't do at\nall,\" he ses.  \"The more money they steal, the longer they'll get; you\nknow that, cap'n, without me telling you.  If you could put fifty quid in\nit would be so much the better.  And, what-ever you do, don't make a\nnoise.  I don't want a lot o' clumsy policemen interfering in my\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"Still, s'pose you didn't catch 'em,\" ses Sam, \"where should I be?\"\n\n\"You needn't be afraid o' that,\" ses the tec, with a laugh.  \"Here, I'll\ntell you wot I'll do, and that'll show you the trust I put in you.\"\n\nHe drew a big di'mond ring off of 'is finger and handed it to Sam.\n\n\"Put that on your finger,\" he ses, \"and keep it there till I give you\nyour money back and the fi'-pun note reward.  It's worth seventy quid\nif it's worth a farthing, and was given to me by a lady of title for\ngetting back 'er jewellery for 'er.  Put it on, and wotever you do,\ndon't lose it\"\n\nHe sat and watched while Sam forced it on is finger.\n\n\"You don't need to flash it about too much,\" he ses, looking at 'im\nrather anxious.  \"There's men I know as 'ud cut your finger off to get\nthat.\"\n\nSam shoved his 'and in his pocket, but he kept taking it out every now\nand then and 'olding his finger up to the light to look at the di'mond.\nMr. Cubbins got up to go at last, saying that he 'ad got a call to make\nat the police-station, and they went out together.\n\n\"Nine o'clock sharp,\" he ses, as they shook hands, \"on Tower Hill.\"\n\n\"I'll be there,\" ses Sam.\n\n\"And, wotever you do, no noise, no calling out,\" ses the tec, \"and don't\nmention a word of this to a living soul.\"\n\nSam shook 'ands with 'im agin, and then, hiding his 'and in his pocket,\nwent off 'ome, and, finding Ginger and Peter Russet wasn't back, went off\nto bed.\n\nHe 'eard 'em coming upstairs in the dark in about an hour's time, and,\nputting the 'and with the ring on it on the counterpane, shut 'is eyes\nand pretended to be fast asleep.  Ginger lit the candle, and they was\nboth beginning to undress when Peter made a noise and pointed to Sam's\n'and.\n\n\"Wot's up?\"  ses Ginger, taking the candle and going over to Sam's bed.\n\"Who've you been robbing, you fat pirate?\"\n\nSam kept 'is eyes shut and 'eard 'em whispering; then he felt 'em take\n'is hand up and look at it.  \"Where did you get it, Sam?\" ses Peter.\n\n\"He's asleep,\" ses Ginger, \"sound asleep.  I b'lieve if I was to put 'is\nfinger in the candle he wouldn't wake up.\"\n\n\"You try it,\" ses Sam, sitting up in bed very sharp and snatching his\n'and away.  \"Wot d'ye mean coming 'ome at all hours and waking me up?\"\n\"Where did you get that ring?\"  ses Ginger.  \"Friend o' mine,\" ses Sam,\nvery short.\n\n\"Who was it?\" ses Peter.\n\n\"It's a secret,\" ses Sam.\n\n\"You wouldn't 'ave a secret from your old pal Ginger, Sam, would you?\"\nses Ginger.\n\n\"Old wot?\" ses Sam.  \"Wot did you call me this arternoon?\"\n\n\"I called you a lot o' things I'm sorry for,\" ses Ginger, who was\nbursting with curiosity, \"and I beg your pardin, Sam.\"\n\n\"Shake 'ands on it,\" ses Peter, who was nearly as curious as Ginger.\n\nThey shook hands, but Sam said he couldn't tell 'em about the ring; and\nseveral times Ginger was on the point of calling 'im the names he 'ad\ncalled 'im in the arternoon, on'y Peter trod on 'is foot and stopped him.\nThey wouldn't let 'im go to sleep for talking, and at last, when 'e was\npretty near tired out, he told 'em all about it.\n\n\"Going--to 'ave your--pocket picked?\"  ses Ginger, staring at 'im, when\n'e had finished.\n\n\"I shall be watched over,\" ses Sam.\n\n\"He's gorn stark, staring mad,\" ses Ginger.  \"Wot a good job it is he's\ngot me and you to look arter 'im, Peter.\"\n\n\"Wot d'ye mean?\"  ses Sam.\n\n\"_Mean?_\"  ses Ginger.  \"Why, it's a put-up job to rob you, o' course.  I\nshould ha' thought even your fat 'ead could ha' seen that':\"\n\n\"When I want your advice I'll ask you for it,\" ses Sam, losing 'is\ntemper.  \"Wot about the di'mond ring--eh?\"\n\n\"You stick to it,\" ses Ginger, \"and keep out o' Mr. Cubbins's way.\nThat's my advice to you.  'Sides, p'r'aps it ain't a real one.\"\n\nSam told 'im agin he didn't want none of 'is advice, and, as Ginger\nwouldn't leave off talking, he pretended to go to sleep.  Ginger woke 'im\nup three times to tell 'im wot a fool 'e was, but 'e got so fierce that\nhe gave it up at last and told 'im to go 'is own way.\n\nSam wouldn't speak to either of 'em next morning, and arter breakfast he\nwent off on 'is own.  He came back while Peter and Ginger was out, and\nthey wasted best part o' the day trying to find 'im.\n\n\"We'll be on Tower Hill just afore nine and keep 'im out o' mischief, any\nway,\" ses Peter.\n\nGinger nodded.  \"And be called names for our pains,\" he ses.  \"I've a\ngood mind to let 'im be robbed.\"\n\n\"It 'ud serve 'im right,\" ses Peter, \"on'y then he'd want to borrer off\nof us.  Look here!  Why not--why not rob 'im ourselves?\"\n\n\"Wot?\" ses Ginger, starting.\n\n\"Walk up behind 'im and rob 'im,\" ses Peter.  \"He'll think it's them two\nchaps he spoke about, and when 'e comes 'ome complaining to us we'll tell\n'im it serves 'im right.  Arter we've 'ad a game with 'im for a day or\ntwo we'll give 'im 'is money back.\"\n\n\"But he'd reckernize us,\" ses Ginger.\n\n\"We must disguise ourselves,\" ses Peter, in a whisper.  \"There's a\nbarber's shop in Cable Street, where I've seen beards in the winder.  You\nhook 'em on over your ears.  Get one o' them each, pull our caps over our\neyes and turn our collars up, and there you are.\"\n\nGinger made a lot of objections, not because he didn't think it was a\ngood idea, but because he didn't like Peter thinking of it instead of\n'im; but he gave way at last, and, arter he 'ad got the beard, he stood\nfor a long time in front o' the glass thinking wot a difference it would\nha' made to his looks if he had 'ad black 'air instead o' red.\n\nWaiting for the evening made the day seem very long to 'em; but it came\nat last, and, with the beards in their pockets, they slipped out and went\nfor a walk round.  They 'ad 'arf a pint each at a public-'ouse at the top\nof the Minories, just to steady themselves, and then they came out and\nhooked on their beards; and wot with them, and pulling their caps down\nand turning their coat-collars up, there wasn't much of their faces to be\nseen by anybody.\n\nIt was just five minutes to nine when they got to Tower Hill, and they\nwalked down the middle of the road, keeping a bright lookout for old Sam.\nA little way down they saw a couple o' chaps leaning up agin a closed\ngate in the dock wall lighting their pipes, and Peter and Ginger both\nnudged each other with their elbows at the same time.  They 'ad just got\nto the bottom of the Hill when Sam turned the corner.\n\nPeter wouldn't believe at fust that the old man wasn't really the worse\nfor liquor, 'e was so lifelike.  Many a drunken man would ha' been proud\nto ha' done it 'arf so well, and it made 'im pleased to think that Sam\nwas a pal of 'is.  Him and Ginger turned and crept up behind the old man\non tiptoe, and then all of a sudden he tilted Sam's cap over 'is eyes and\nflung his arms round 'im, while Ginger felt in 'is coat-pockets and took\nout a leather purse chock full o' money.\n\nIt was all done and over in a moment, and then, to Ginger's great\nsurprise, Sam suddenly lifted 'is foot and gave 'im a fearful kick on the\nshin of 'is leg, and at the same time let drive with all his might in 'is\nface.  Ginger went down as if he 'ad been shot, and as Peter went to 'elp\nhim up he got a bang over the 'cad that put 'im alongside o' Ginger,\narter which Sam turned and trotted off down the Hill like a dancing-bear.\n\nFor 'arf a minute Ginger didn't know where 'e was, and afore he found out\nthe two men they'd seen in the gateway came up, and one of 'em put his\nknee in Ginger's back and 'eld him, while the other caught hold of his\n'and and dragged the purse out of it.  Arter which they both made off up\nthe Hill as 'ard as they could go, while Peter Russet in a faint voice\ncalled \"Police!\" arter them.\n\nHe got up presently and helped Ginger up, and they both stood there\npitying themselves, and 'elping each other to think of names to call Sam.\n\n\"Well, the money's gorn, and it's 'is own silly fault,\" ses Ginger.  \"But\nwotever 'appens, he mustn't know that we had a 'and in it, mind that.\"\n\n\"He can starve for all I care,\" ses Peter, feeling his 'ead.  \"I won't\nlend 'im a ha'penny--not a single, blessed ha'penny.\"\n\n\"Who'd ha' thought 'e could ha' hit like that?\" says Ginger.  \"That's wot\ngets over me.  I never 'ad such a bang in my life--never.  I'm going to\n'ave a little drop o' brandy--my 'ead is fair swimming.\"\n\nPeter 'ad one, too; but though they went into the private bar, it wasn't\nprivate enough for them; and when the landlady asked Ginger who'd been\nkissing 'im, he put 'is glass down with a bang and walked straight off\n'ome.\n\nSam 'adn't turned up by the time they got there, and pore Ginger took\nadvantage of it to put a little warm candle-grease on 'is bad leg.  Then\nhe bathed 'is face very careful and 'elped Peter bathe his 'ead.  They\n'ad just finished when they heard Sam coming upstairs, and Ginger sat\ndown on 'is bed and began to whistle, while Peter took up a bit o'\nnewspaper and stood by the candle reading it.\n\n\"Lor' lumme, Ginger!\" ses Sam, staring at 'im.  \"What ha' you been\na-doing to your face?\"\n\n\"Me?\" ses Ginger, careless-like.  \"Oh, we 'ad a bit of a scrap down\nLimehouse way with some Scotchies.  Peter got a crack over the 'ead at\nthe same time.\"\n\n\"Ah, I've 'ad a bit of a scrap, too,\" ses Sam, smiling all over, \"but I\ndidn't get marked.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" ses Peter, without looking up from 'is paper.  \"Was it a little\nboy, then?\"  ses Ginger.\n\n\"No, it wasn't a little boy neither, Ginger,\" ses Sam; \"it was a couple\no' men twice the size of you and Peter here, and I licked 'em both.  It\nwas the two men I spoke to you about last night.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" ses Peter agin, yawning.\n\n\"I did a bit o' thinking this morning,\" ses Sam, nodding at 'em, \"and I\ndon't mind owning up that it was owing to wot you said.  You was right,\nGinger, arter all.\"\n\n\"Fust thing I did arter breakfast,\" ses Sam, \"I took that di'mond ring to\na pawnshop and found out it wasn't a di'mond ring.  Then I did a bit more\nthinking, and I went round to a shop I know and bought a couple o'\nknuckle-dusters.\"\n\n\"Couple o' wot?\" ses Ginger, in a choking voice.\n\n\"Knuckle-dusters,\" ses Sam, \"and I turned up to-night at Tower Hill with\none on each 'and just as the clock was striking nine.  I see 'em the\nmoment I turned the corner--two enormous big chaps, a yard acrost the\nshoulders, coming down the middle of the road--You've got a cold,\nGinger!\"\n\n\"No, I ain't,\" ses Ginger.\n\n\"I pretended to be drunk, same as the tec told me,\" ses Sam, \"and then I\nfelt 'em turn round and creep up behind me.  One of 'em come up behind\nand put 'is knee in my back and caught me by the throat, and the other\ngave me a punch in the chest, and while I was gasping for breath took my\npurse away.  Then I started on 'em.\"\n\n\"Lor'!\" ses Ginger, very nasty.\n\n\"I fought like a lion,\" ses Sam.  \"Twice they 'ad me down, and twice I\ngot up agin and hammered 'em.  They both of 'em 'ad knives, but my blood\nwas up, and I didn't take no more notice of 'em than if they was made of\npaper.  I knocked 'em both out o' their hands, and if I hit 'em in the\nface once I did a dozen times.  I surprised myself.\"\n\n\"You surprise me,\" ses Ginger.\n\n\"All of a sudden,\" ses Sam, \"they see they 'ad got to do with a man wot\ndidn't know wot fear was, and they turned round and ran off as hard as\nthey could run.  You ought to ha' been there, Ginger.  You'd 'ave enjoyed\nit.\"\n\nGinger Dick didn't answer 'im.  Having to sit still and listen to all\nthem lies without being able to say anything nearly choked 'im.  He sat\nthere gasping for breath.\n\n\"O' course, you got your purse back in the fight, Sam?\"  ses Peter.\n\n\"No, mate,\" ses Sam.  \"I ain't going to tell you no lies--I did not.\"\n\n\"And 'ow are you going to live, then, till you get a ship, Sam?\"  ses\nGinger, in a nasty voice.  \"You won't get nothing out o' me, so you\nneedn't think it.\"\n\n\"Wot on earth's the matter, Ginger?\"\n\n\"Nor me,\" ses Peter.  \"Not a brass farthing.\"\n\n\"There's no call to be nasty about it, mates,\" ses Sam.  \"I 'ad the best\nfight I ever 'ad in my life, and I must put up with the loss.  A man\ncan't 'ave it all his own way.\"\n\n\"'Ow much was it?\" ses Peter.\n\n\"Ten brace-buttons, three French ha'pennies, and a bit o' tin,\" ses Sam.\n\"Wot on earth's the matter, Ginger?\"\n\nGinger didn't answer him.",
