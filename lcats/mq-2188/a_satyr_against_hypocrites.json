Then comes old _Robin_ too,\n    Who although write or reade he neither doe,\n    Yet hath his Testament chain\u2019d to his waste,\n    And his blind zeale feels out the proofs as fast,\n    And makes as greasie Dogs-ears as the best.\n    A new shav\u2019d Cobler follows him, as it hapt,\n    With his young _Cake bread_ in his cloak close wrapt;\n    Then panting comes his Wife from t\u2019other end\n    O\u2019th\u2019 Town to hear Our Father and see a friend;\n    Then came the shops young Fore-man, \u2019tis presum\u2019d,\n    With hair rose water\u2019d, and his gloves perfum\u2019d,\n    With his blew shoo-strings too, and besides that,\n    A riband with a sentence in his hat.\n    The Virgins too, the fair one, and the Gypsie,\n    _Spectatum veniunt, veniunt spectentur ut ips\u00e6_.\n    And now the silk\u2019n Dames throng in, good store,\n    And casting up their noses, to th\u2019 pew dore\n    They come, croud in, for though the pew be full\n    They must and will have room, I, that they wull;\n    Streight that she sits not uppermost distast\n    One takes; \u2019Tis fine that I must be displac\u2019d\n    By you, she cries then, Good Mistris Gill Flurt;\n    Gill Flurt, enrag\u2019d cries t\u2019other, Why ya dirt-\n    -ie piece of Impudence, ye ill-bred Thief.\n    I scorn your terms, good Mistris Thimble-mans wife.\n    Marry come up, cries t\u2019other, pray forbear,\n    Surely your husband\u2019s but a Scavenger,\n    Cries t\u2019other then, and what are you I pray?\n    No Aldermans wife for all you are so gay.\n    Is it not you that to all Christenings frisk it?\n    And to save bread, most shamefully steal the bisket,\n    At which the other mad beyond all law,\n    Unsheaths her talons, and prepares to claw.\n    And sure some gorgets had been torn that day,\n    But that the Readers voice did part the fray.\n\n      Now what a wardrobe could I put to view,\n    The cloak-bag-breeches, and the sleek-stone shoe,\n    The Gallimafry cloak that looks like nonsense,\n    Now wide, now narrow, like his Master\u2019s conscience:\n    The grogram gown of such antiquity,\n    That _Speed_ could never finde its pedigree;\n    Fit to be doted on by Antiquary\u2019s,\n    Who hence may descant in their old Glossary\u2019s,\n    What kinde of fardingale fair _Helen_ wore,\n    How wings in fashion came, because wings bore\n    The Swan-transformed _Leda_ to _Jove_\u2019s lap,\n    Our Matrons hoping thence the same good hap;\n    The pent-house bever, and calves-chaudron ruff,\n    But of these frantick fashions now enough,\n    For now there shall no more of them be said,\n    Lest this my ware-house spoil the French-men\u2019s trade.\n      And now as if I were that wollen-spinster,\n    That doth so gravely show you _Sarum_ Minster,\n    He lead ye round the Church from pew to pew,\n    And shew you what doth most deserve your view,\n    There stood the Font, in times of Christianity,\n    But now \u2019tis tak\u2019n down, men call it Vanity;\n                  [Sidenote: Ingredients that compound a Congregation.]\n    There the Church-Wardens sit, hard by the dore,\n    But know ye why they sit among the Poor?\n    Because they love um well for love o\u2019th\u2019 box,\n    Their money buys good beef, good wine, good smocks.\n    There sits the Clerk, and there the reverend Reader,\n    And there\u2019s the Pulpit for the good flock-Feeder,\n    Who in three lamentable dolefull ditty\u2019s\n    Unto their marriage-fees sing _Nunc dimittis_.\n    Here sits a learned Justice, truly so\n    Some people say, and some again say no,\n    And yet methinks in this he seemeth wise\n    To make _Stypone_ yeild him an excise,\n    And though on Sundaies, Ale-houses must down,\n    Yet wisely all the week lets them alone,\n    For well his Worship knows that Ale-house sins\n    Maintain himself in gloves, his wife in pins.\n    There sits the Major, as fat as any bacon\n    With eating custard, beef, and rumps of capon;\n    And there his corpulent Brethren sit by,\n    With faces representing gravity,\n    Who having money, though they have no wit,\n    They weare gold-chains, and here in green pews sit.\n    There sit True-blew the honest Parish-masters,\n    With Sattin Caps, and Ruffs, and Demi-casters,\n    And faith that\u2019s all; for they have no rich fansies,\n    No Poets are, nor Authors of Romances.\n    There sits a Lady fine, painted by Art,\n    And there sits curious Mistris Fiddle-cum-fart:\n    There sits a Chamber-maid upon a Hassock,\n    Whom th\u2019 Chaplain oft instructs without his Cassock:\n    One more accustom\u2019d unto Curtain-sins,\n    Than to her thimble, or to handle pins.\n    O what a glosse her forehead smooth adorns!\n    Excelling _Ph\u0153be_ with her silver horns.\n    It tempts a man at first, yet strange to utter,\n    When one comes neere, fogh gudds, it stinks of butter.\n    Another tripping comes to her Mistris\u2019s Pew,\n    Where being arriv\u2019d, she tryes if she can view\n    Her young mans face, and straight heaves up her coats,\n    That her sweet-heart may see her true-love knots.\n    But having sate up late the night before\n    To let the young-man in at the back-doore,\n    She feeleth drowzinesse upon her creeping,\n    Turnes downe one proofe, and then she falls a sleeping.\n    Then fell her head one way, her book another,\n    And surely she did dream by what we gather;\n                        [Sidenote: Maids beware of sleeping at Church.]\n    For long she had not slept, when a rude flea\n    Upon her groyn sharply began to prey;\n    Straight she (twixt sleep and waking) in great ire,\n    As if sh\u2019ad sitting been by th\u2019 Kitchin fire,\n    Pulls up her coats with both hands, smock and all,\n    And with both hands to scratch and scrub doth fall.\n    Truly the Priest, though some did, saw her not,\n    For he was praying and his eyes were shut.\n    Alas had he seen as much as a by-stander,\n    Much more from\u2019s Text it would have made him wander.\n\n      That\u2019s call\u2019d the Gallery, which (as you may see)\n    Was trimm\u2019d and gilt in the yeare Fifty three.\n    Twas a zealous work, and done by two Church-wardens,\n    Who for mis-reckoning hope to have their Pardons.\n    There _Will_ writes Short-hand with a pen of brasse,\n                                                   [Sidenote: Hang it.]\n    Oh how he\u2019s wonder\u2019d at by many an asse\n    That see him shake so fast his wartie fist,\n    As if he\u2019d write the Sermon \u2019fore the Priest\n    Has spoke it; Then, O that I could (sayes one)\n    Doe but as this man does, I\u2019de give a crowne.\n    Up goes another hand, up goe his eyes,\n    And he, Gifts, Industrie, and Talents cryes.\n\n      Thus are they plac\u2019d at length: a tedious work.\n    And now a bellowing noise went round the Kirk,\n    From the low Font, up to the Golden Creed.\n    (O happy they who now no eares doe need!)\n    While these cough up their morning flegme, and those\n    Doe trumpet forth the snivel of their nose;\n    Straight then the Clerk began with potsheard voice\n    To grope a tune, singing with wofull noise,\n    Like a crackt Sans-bell jarring in the Steeple,\n    _Tom Sternholds_ wretched Prick-song to the people:\n    Who soon as he hath pac\u2019d the first line through,\n    Up steps _Chuck-farthing_ then, and he reads too:\n    This is the womans boy that sits i\u2019th\u2019 Porch\n    Till th\u2019 Sexton comes, and brings her stoole to Church.\n    Then out the people yaule an hundred parts,\n    Some roare, some whine, some creak like wheels of Carts,\n    Such Notes that _Gamut_ never yet did know,\n    Nor numerous keys of Harpsicalls in a row\n    Their Heights and Depths could ever comprehend,\n    Now below double _Ae_ some descend.\n    \u2019Bove _Ela_ squealing now ten notes some flie;\n    Straight then as if they knew they were too high,\n    With head-long haste downe staires againe they tumble;\n    Discords and Concords O how thick they jumble!\n    Like untam\u2019d horses tearing with their throats\n    One wretched stave into an hundred notes.\n    Some lazie-throated fellowes thus did baule,\n                                [Sidenote: _Robert Wisdome_\u2019s delight.]\n    [Illustration:\n    They a i hin a moy a meat uh ga have\n    a ha me uh a ha a gall a.\n    And some out-run their words and thus they say,\n    Too cruell for to think a hum a haw.]\n\n      Now what a whetstone was it to devotion\n    To see the pace, the looks, and every motion\n    O\u2019th Sunday Levite when up stairs he march\u2019t,\n    And first beheld his little band stiff-starcht,\n    Two caps he had, and turns up that within,\n    You\u2019d think he wore a black pot tipt with tin,\n    His cuffs asham\u2019d peept only out at \u2019s wrist\n    For they saw whiter gloves upon his fist,\n    Out comes his kerchief then which he unfolds\n    As gravely as his Text, and fast he holds,\n    In\u2019s wrath-denouncing hand; then mark when he pray\u2019d\n    How he rear\u2019d his reverend whites, and softly said\n    A long _most Murcifull_, or _O Al_----\n    Then out he whines the rest like a sad ditty,\n    In a most dolefull _recitative style_,\n    His buttocks keeping Crotchet-time the while;\n    And as he slubbers ore his tedious story\n    Makes it his chiefest aime his chiefest glory,\n    T\u2019 excell the City Dames in speaking fine,\n    O for the drippings of an old Sir loyne,\n    Instead of _Aron_\u2019s ointment for his face,\n    When he cries out for _greace_ instead of _grace_.\n    Up stept another then, how sowre his face is!\n    How grim he lookt, for he was one oth\u2019 _Classis_,\n    And here he cries, _Blood, blood, blood, destroy, O Lord!_\n    _The Covenant-breaker with a two-edg\u2019d sword._\n    Now comes another, of another strain,\n    And he of law and bondage doth complain:\n    Then shewing his broad teeth, and grinning wide,\n    Aloud, _Free grace, free grace, free grace_, he cry\u2019d.\n    Up went a Chaplain then, fixing his eye\n    Devoutly on his Patron\u2019s gallery,\n    Who as duty bindes him, cause he eats their pyes,\n    _God blesse my good Lord and my Lady_, cryes,\n    _And\u2019s hopefull Issue_. Then with count\u2019nance sad,\n    Up steps a man, stark revelation-mad,\n    And he, _Cause us thy Saints, for thy dear sake_,\n    _That We a bustle in the World may make_,\n    _Thy enemies now rage_, and by and by\n    He tears his throat for the _fifth Monarchy_.\n    Another mounts his chin, East, West, North, South,\n    Gaping to catch a blessing in his mouth,\n    And saying, _Lord!

wine.\n    Truly we cannot but rejoyce to see\n    Thy gifts dispenc\u2019d with such equality.\n    To us th\u2019ast given wide throats, and teeth to eate;\n    To the women, knowledge how to dress

he plough\u2019d up the Beefe like Forrest-land,\n    And fum\u2019d, because the bones his wrath withstand?\n    Upon the Mutton he fell not like a Lamb,\n    But rather like a Wolfe he tore the same.\n    At first a Sister helpt him, but this Elfe sir,\n    Wearying her out, she cryes, _Pray help your self sir!_\n    Upon the Pasty though he fell anon,\n    As if \u2019t had been the walls of _Babylon_.\n    Like a Cathedrall downe he throwes that stuffe,\n    _Why, Sisters_, saith he, _I am pepper-proofe_.\n    Then down he powres the Claret, and down again,\n    And _would the French King were a Puritan_\n    He cryes: swills up the Sack, and I\u2019le be sworn\n                                    [Sidenote: Christian forgivenesse.]\n    Quoth he, _Spaine\u2019s_ King is not the

Then quoth _Priscilla_, Oh my brother deare:\n    Truly y\u2019are welcome to this homely cheare,\n    And therefore eate, good brother, eate your fill,\n    Alas for _Daniel_, my heart aketh still.\n    Then quoth the Priest, _Sister be of good heart_;\n    But she reply\u2019d _good brother eate some Tart_.\n    _Rebecca_ then a member of the \u2019lection\n    Began to talk of brotherly affection;\n    For this, said she; as I have heard the wise\n    Discourse, consisteth much in exercise.\n    Yet I was foolish, and would oft resist,\n    But you had more grace, Brother, than to desist.\n    Streight he reply\u2019d, there is a time for all things,\n    There is a time for great things and for small things,\n    There\u2019s a time to eate, and drink, and reformation,\n    A time to empty, and for procreation.\n    Therefore deare Sister let us take our time,\n    There\u2019s reason for\u2019t, I never car\u2019d for Rhyme.\n    Then truly answer\u2019d she, tis a good

ingratefull for your love,\n    But sometimes Angels did attend your Purse,\n    At other times you know I did you nurse,\n    With many a secret dish of lusty meat,\n    And presently we went and did the feat.\n    Truly quoth _Dorcas_ then, I saw a Vision,\n    That we should have our foes in great derision.\n    Quoth _Martha_ straight (and then she shook the crums\n    From off her apron white, and pickt her gums)\n    So I doe hope, for so our Brother said;\n    O what a heavenly piece of work he made!\n    But I am ign\u2019rant, and my memory short,\n    I shall forget, were I to be

knocks down, and at length\n    We eate him up. A Turkie\u2019s very gay,\n    Like worldly people clad in fine array;\n    Yet on the Spit it looks most piteous,\n    And we devoure it, as the wormes eate us.\n      Then full of sawce and zeale up steps _Elnathan_,\n    [This was his name now, once he had another,\n    Untill the Ducking-pond made him a Brother]\n    A Deacon, and a Buffeter of Sathan.\n                                 [Sidenote: A man may love his brother]\n    Truly, quoth he, I know a Brother deare,\n    Would gladly pick the bones of what\u2019s left here.\n    Nay he would gladly pick your pockets too\n    Of a small two-pence, or a groat, or so,\n    The sorry remnants of a broken shilling;\n    Therefore I pray you friends be not unwilling.\n    But as for me, tis more than I doe need,\n    To be charitable both in word and deed;\n    For as to us, the holy Scriptures say,\n                                                        [Sidenote: but]\n    _The Deacons must receive, the Lay-men pay._\n    Why Heathen folks that doe in Taverns stray,\n    Will never let their friends the reckning pay.\n    And therefore poure your charity into the bason,\n    Brethren and Sisters eke, your coats have lace on.\n    Why Brethren in the Lord, what need you care\n    For six pence? we\u2019ll one houre enhance our ware.\n    Your six pence comes againe, nay there comes more;\n    Thus Charity\u2019s th\u2019 encreaser of your store.\n    Truly well spoke, then cry\u2019d the Master-feaster,\n    Since you say so, here, you shall have my tester:\n    But for the women, they gave more liberally,\n    For they were sure to whom they gave, and why:\n                                  [Sidenote: Not better than himselfe.]\n      Then did _Elnathan_ blinke, for he knew well\n    What he might give, and what he might conceale.\n    But now the Parson could no longer stay,\n    \u2019Tis time to kiss, he cryes and so away.\n    At which the sisters, once th\u2019 alarum tak\u2019n,\n    Made such a din as would have serv\u2019d to wak\u2019n\n    A snoring brother, when he sleeps at Church;\n    With bagg and baggage then they gan to march;\n    And tickled with the thoughts of their delight,\n    One sister to the other bids Good night.\n    Good night quoth _Dorcas_ to _Priscilla_, she,\n    Good night deare sister _Dorcas_ unto thee.\n    In these goodly good nights much time was spent,\n    And was it not a holy complement?\n    At length in steps the Parson, on his breast\n                                         [Sidenote: Christian Liberty.]\n    Laying his hand.
