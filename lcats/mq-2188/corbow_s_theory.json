    "body": "\"All right! So we've got it. The same problem rocket designers have\nbeen struggling with for five years. Nobody's found the answer--and\nthey never will!\"\n\nBronsen Corbow glared at the older man, his lips pressed tightly\ntogether to keep from giving voice to the anger mounting inside of him.\nMars Kenton was an argumentative old fool, but the company had made him\nhis assistant and nothing could be done about it.\n\n\"They've known ever since they discovered that interstellar drive,\"\nMars continued, \"that they can only make enough Carbolium to send four\nships a year to the end of our galaxy and back again. Is it our fault\nthey have to make the blasted stuff instead of mining it out of the\nground?\"\n\nThe words ringing in the quiet of the laboratory seemed to pound in\nBronsen's ears and he found he could hold his tongue no longer. He\nleaned toward the older physicist and slammed his hand down on the\ntable.\n\n\"That's enough, Mars. I happen to be the one in charge here, not\nyou.\" His quiet voice made clear the anger he felt. \"Reed turned\nthe problem over to us. I say we can lick it. Just because my chief\nassistant is still thinking in terms of ancient history, it's no reason\nto send back a report from this laboratory saying we can't handle the\nproblem.\" He ran a trembling hand through his close-cropped hair and\nswore at himself when he saw Mars noticed the trembling. Why did he\nhave to start shaking every time he got mad? The person he was mad at\ninvariably took the shaking to be fear, and he would always be forced\nto drive his point home all the harder in order to get the respect he\ndemanded.\n\nMars Kenton sneered. \"Mind telling me just how you are going to\neliminate interstellar drive from our rocket ships? Or have you cooked\nup another of your bright ideas to try out at the company's expense?\"\n\n\"I'm fed up with you, Mars!\" All control over his temper was gone now\nand the younger man gave full vent to his anger. His powerful body\nfairly bristled in his rage and in spite of himself Mars was forced\nto cringe beneath the assailing roars that followed. \"You may be\ntwenty years older than I am; you may have been one of the pioneers\nin space travel; you may still be a good man if you could forget that\nthe whole world didn't plot that accident that left you with a bad\nleg--but you're still taking orders from me. We have some good men in\nthis department, and you can either keep your mouth shut and work with\nus or you can get out. Interstellar drive isn't the only solution to\nspace travel and the answer to the problem is going to come from this\nlaboratory. Now take your choice!\"\n\nMars glared at Bronsen and seethed inwardly but swung back to his\nwork table. His right leg twitched convulsively, forcing him into a\nstumbling limp and he silently cursed the fate that had brought him to\nsuch a lowly existance. Him! Joc Kenton! Member of the first expedition\nto land on Mars and successfully return to Earth. And what was he\nnow? Just a second rate design consultant working in a laboratory on\nthe moon. His water blue eyes clouded in his flood of self pity. How\nbeautiful it had been out there ... all blackness, all majesty, the\nthrobbing power of the rockets, the thrill of unknown adventures in the\nvoid. His rickety old heart beat faster with remembering. The scorching\ndesolateness of Mars was something he would never forget. Even now\nhe could see the miles of heat-drenched land, the thick red powder\nthat covered the planet's crust, the stretching reaches of nothing\nbut a barren, dead world. And then--the accident. Sure, it was just\nan accident. How could he know that the port lid was going to break\nits magnetic field and slam down upon him? It had though, and he had\nreturned an honored man, praised for his self-sacrificing adventure,\nthen pitied because he would spend the rest of his life a crippled man.\nHe twisted his thin, blue-veined hands together, those hands that had\npiloted a glittering rocket through space, those hands that had sifted\nthrough the sands of an alien world, those hands that now were white\nand fragile, working over drawings and plans for other ships. Gone were\nthe dreams, and with their going came the bitterness.\n\nHe felt his anger melting in his own self pity, decided not to brush\naway the tears that gathered in his eyes and turned to his board,\nstaring at it through blurred vision.\n\n\"Bong! End of round five. Just wait around a minute folks, next\nround coming up.\" Vern Webber peered cautiously around the door as\nif expecting something to fly at him, then jumped into the room. His\nyouthful face broke into a broad grin as he bowed before the chief\ndesigner. \"Oh great and noble Mr. Bronsen Corbow. Is it safe for your\nlowly servant to approach these hallowed halls in answer to your\nsummons? Mine is not to reason why--but I'd still like to leave here\nwith my head on my shoulders.\"\n\nBronsen found himself smiling at his young assistant. Vern, although\nhe was twenty-four, had the spirit and air of a teenager and usually\nsucceeded in keeping the lab in a state of high humor. The tenseness of\nthe argument with Mars dispelled itself and Bronsen relaxed.\n\n\"Get word to the men that we are having a special meeting this\nafternoon, in the conference room. We're going to blow the lid right\noff the present concepts of space travel and really give those people\nout there something that will make their eyes bulge. I'll tell you more\nabout it this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir!\" Vern clicked his heels, gave an exaggerated salute and\nwas gone.\n\nBronsen glanced in returning annoyance at the snort of disgust that\nissued from Mars' corner. That old fool and his rockets, he thought\nwere things of the past. There was only the future now. New ideas, new\nmethods, new successes. Why couldn't Mars see that? And yet, Bronsen\nhimself felt a tiny pulsing of doubt. He cursed himself for that tinge\nof self-distrust, but could do nothing about it. He was brilliant, he\nwas a master of design and he knew space flight as well as he knew the\nshape, workings and complexities of the pencil he twirled in his hands.\nBut what if he wasn't right? What if his new theory _was_ a flop--and\nwith it a waste of money, time and human lives?\n\nHe tore himself from his dismal thoughts with a savage determination\nand strode into his office. That damned Mars was just getting under\nhis skin, that's all. Listen to him long enough and he'll have you\nthinking we should all have stayed back in the horse and buggy days. No\nproblems of space flight then, no old beliefs, ancient ideas, stagnant\nprejudices to worry about then. Not as far as traveling to the stars\nwas concerned, anyway.\n\n\n\n\"First, let's review a few points I know you are all familiar with,\nbut that you should keep in mind, starting with the beginning of space\ntravel.\" Bronsen ran his hand through his hair and looked over the\neagerly expectant faces of his staff, considering carefully the points\nhe had to make.\n\n\"First, there were the Detorium-driven rockets. Fine ships that opened\nup the realm of travel in outer space.\" His voice was firm, stringent\nwith his inner excitement, his faith in his idea. \"In fact, it was\njust such a ship as this that Joc Kenton, Mars to you folks, was on\nwhen they made their first landing on Mars. These ships had their good\npoints and still are excellent over short distances but certainly are\nof no use for intergalactic flight. They are much too slow, requiring\nmore than a lifetime to make the trip there and back.\n\n\"Then came the interstellar drive, the method we are now using. This\ndrive, utilizing Carbolium which we have to manufacture, makes full\nuse of space as a medium of travel. There's only one catch. We can\nmake only a certain amount of Carbolium, and the costs of making it\nare astronomical. However, no matter what the expense, the supply is\nlimited. Still, everything's fine. We use the old rockets for short\ndistances and the interstellar drive for intergalactic trips.\"\n\nHe paused a minute to let it sink in. \"That is everything _was_ fine.\nAs you know, we have found another planet, remarkably similar to Earth\nin the Eastrex Galaxy, and have succeeded in setting up a colony there.\nThis presents problems. For one, since we can send only four ships a\nyear to Naver, this new planet, our colonizing is going to be slowed\ndown to a crawl. Also, we will have a mighty hard time trying to get\nsupplies and everything else that a new colony needs to Naver within a\nreasonable length of time. In other words, what we need is a ship that\nwill be cheap to run, fast enough to get there and get back again and\nalso safe enough to carry passengers and cargo, even in small amounts.\nYou've heard of this problem before; I know you've tried independently\nto work it out and have not had much luck. I think we might have an\nanswer now.\n\n\"How many of you have shot a rifle or are familiar with a gun?\"\n\nThe expectant faces had gone blank. What was he leading up to anyhow?\nStill, a large number of hands cautiously worked their way into the air.\n\n\"All right. All you have to do right now is forget about space ships\nand concentrate on a rifle and a bullet.\" There was beginning to be\nthe muttering and stirring of a confused group of people. Bronsen's\nmuscular hands gripped the table eagerly. They were confused, but they\nwere also interested. \"You are familiar with the fields and grooves\nof a gun barrel,\" he continued, \"and you know they are there to give\nthe bullet a spin when it is fired. Now what happens to a bullet when\nit is fired from a smooth barrel, with no grooves? It is inaccurate,\nwobbles, has less power and eventually turns end over end. Now, take\nthe grooved rifle barrel. The bullet is given a spin, it has many times\nthe velocity of the other, it has a straight line accuracy due to the\nspiral motion--keep these last two points in mind--and providing the\nrifle is aimed right in the first place, will hit the target.\"\n\nThe group was being split up into two factions, those who leaned\nforward expectantly once more and those who shook their heads in\nbafflement.\n\n\"Now, let's go back again to the old rockets, and also our present\nones. They all use the same principle to get off the ground--blast\noff with rockets. But let's add a second type of blasting off area,\nalso using rockets, but one that looks like a monstrous rifle barrel,\ncomplete to the fields and grooves. We have a launching apparatus\nthat is like a grooved rifle compared to a smooth barreled one. The\nsmooth barrel that we now use, the rockets taking off straight, gives\ngood acceleration but not enough top speed. Our old rockets had that\nfault and never could get good velocity even when in flight. Our new\nones take over with the interstellar drive, but we want to eliminate\nthis last method. The spiral take off though, would give much greater\nvelocity right from the start, would enable the ship to hit outer space\nwith a greater speed than it could attain using the other methods\nand it would continue on in space at a much faster rate. The lack of\nfriction would keep it from slowing down and if we could hit the speed\nwe want before entering outer space, the ship could go right on at that\nsame rate in space. There wouldn't even be need for rocket power while\nin actual galactic flight. The initial momentum would carry it through\nto its destination. The rocket could do all this because this spiral\nlaunching would give us more 'muzzle velocity', and in a given time\nafter blast off, the spinning ship would have reached a much greater\nspeed than the regularly fired one. This means operating cost will be\nconfined to blast off, landing and to skirt around any sudden dangers\nthat might arise in space.\n\n\"We therefore have a ship that has the velocity of the drive and maybe\nmore, without the cost of drive. It has safety since our old rockets\nproved to be remarkably accident-free and this design would actually\nbe working on almost the same principle as the old rockets, except for\nthe blast off. The difference in outer space would be this. The old\nships used rockets throughout the trip to increase their velocity. The\nnew ones will be traveling so fast when they enter outer space, they\nwon't have to use any power because they will already have the velocity\nneeded.\"\n\nHe paused to swallow the dryness in his mouth and noticed with pleasure\nthat more than one face was twisted in thought. Good. All they have to\ndo is be given a theory to think about, the time to do that thinking\nand they'd be on their way.\n\n\"That's about it for now. I have some ideas of my own for the design\nof this ship ... and it's really surprising when you think how simple\nit is. But I'll save that for some other time. Right now, I'd want all\nof you to think about it. It gets top priority. Report back to me with\nyour ideas. I think we can lick this problem and get our bread and\nbutter, Inter Galactic Enterprises, right on top of the pile. Good\nluck.\"\n\nThe meeting broke up amidst frantic discussion, wails of\nmisunderstanding, confusion and quiet self-musings. Bronsen smiled to\nhimself, his face almost boyishly radiant in his pleasure. The seed had\nbeen planted. Now all he had to do was give it time to grow and bear\nfruit.\n\n\n\nVern's cry of amazement rang with reverence as he stood with Bronsen\nlooking over the first test rocket as it was slowly wheeled to the\nlaunching area. \"Boy-o-boy! Look at that beauty! Did you ever see\nanything like it?\" The silver ship lay on its side as it approached the\nhuge tower, but already Vern could see its glistening majesty soaring\nthrough the sky.\n\n\"She was a lot of work, Vern. Let's just keep our fingers crossed.\nBy the way, that design of yours on the rotating cylinder inside the\nrocket, working independently of the rocket's forced spin, was good.\nTough thing to lick, but now the pilot can keep a steady 'up' and\n'down' no matter how much the outside of the ship is spinning. Good\nwork.\"\n\nVern shrugged his shoulders. \"Just call me the Einstein of the 23rd\ncentury, that's all. We'll all see how well everything works pretty\nsoon now.\"\n\nBronsen was finding the tension beginning to build up in him. Just\na few more hours and his theory would be lauded with success or\nshattered into the dust. He peered at the rocket, at the tiny black\nfigures of the men that were dwarfed by its size and at the giant,\nblack tube, towering hundreds of feet high, waiting patiently to\nreceive her first charge. The needle-nosed space craft glistened in\nthe early morning sun, her thin beauty tantalizing to the senses of a\nspaceman. Her lines swept gracefully back across her smooth expanse\nuntil they hit the four fin tips sweeping out from the rotating band of\nthe tail piece, the fin tips that would fit into the slowly spiraling\ngrooves of the launching tower. The field and groove construction first\nsuggested by Bronsen had been replaced by lands and grooves when it was\nfound that the fewer grooves gave greater accuracy and better muzzle\nvelocity when tested on the laboratory models. Thus, there were only\nfour fins instead of the originally planned eight.\n\nThe rocket reached the lowering platform and Bronsen watched in nervous\nanxiety as the ship was lowered into the ground tail first, then slowly\nbegan its upward ascent into the belly of the launcher. He thought of a\nthousand things that could happen right then, found that none of them\nwere going to and returned to his office. The rocket was safely nestled\nin the launcher's belly, patiently waiting for the human crew to arrive\nand give it life.\n\nWhen they gathered about the launching field that afternoon Bronsen\nfound himself sweating in both the heat of the day and the torrid\nintensity of Mars' insistence that the whole thing was going to be one\nbig flop.\n\n\"Just one blast from those rockets and we'll all be blown into the next\ngalaxy, without benefit of a space ship. Trying to shoot a 70,000 pound\nrocket as if it were a toy gun. You'll learn one of these days, Corbow,\nthat the old way was still the best. It got us to Mars and back and if\nyou'd work on that instead of this, it would be good for intergalactic\nflight too. But no, you've got to have your name up there in print.\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up your damned mumbling, Mars!\"\n\nBronsen shot the words out savagely. He gave the older man a withering\nlook and turned his attention again to the ship. The men that were\nto take her up had disappeared inside the expanse of the launching\ntower and the other figures darted back and forth, making last minute\npreparations. The minutes began to tick off. Five minutes until blast\noff. Four minutes. Three minutes. The field was now completely devoid\nof human figures. Two minutes. One minute. Ten seconds, nine, eight.\nThe launcher looked lonely and terrifying in its greatness and Bronsen\ntried to wish the rocket up out of her belly by will power alone.\n_Four, three, two, one...._\n\nThe ground trembled as the ear-shattering roar jumped across the lunar\nlandscape. The sound grew louder, sharper, and Bronsen began to think\nhis head would split with the noise. The rockets pitched higher,\ntheir scream pierced the air and then the silver nose of the ship\nedged above the top of the launcher. It pulled further into view, the\nshimmering silver glinting in the sun and Bronsen clenched his fists in\nanxiety. Come on baby; show them what you can do. That's it baby, keep\nright on coming. Come on girl! The ship rose clear of the launcher, the\ndistance making it look as if it were shot straight out, but Bronsen\nknew the steadily spinning hull was heading right.\n\nSuddenly he noticed it. Something was wrong! The ship wasn't acting\nright. What was it? His eyes tried to leap from his head to get closer\nto the rising needle and then he saw it. It was shaking. The whole ship\nwas trembling as if in human terror. He watched the tremors pass from\nthe nose to the tail, each one more violent than the last, until the\nwhole ship was wracked with a shaking like palsy. Why? It had worked so\nbeautifully with the experimental models. What was causing it? The bow\nof the ship was now visibly shaking, the tremors becoming more savage\nand then the nose began to dip. With a final shudder of resignation,\nthe rocket pitched over and began its screaming descent. Bronsen\nwatched the plunging ship, felt his heart grab in pain in his chest and\nstumbled back from the observation window unable to watch any longer.\nThe burst of a million shells at once slammed into the unyielding lunar\nplain. In his mind's eye he could see the twisted, exploding mass of\nmetal and the thought sickened him.\n\nThe others ran from the room, heading for the wrecked ship. Bronsen\nwatched them with dull eyes and made no attempt to follow. What could\nthey do for the four men that had gone to their deaths in his mad\ncreation? What could they do for the millions of dollars that now lay a\ntwisted heap of rubble? He turned to drag his defeated body back to the\nlab, to twist and mull in his mind what had happened, and found himself\nlooking into the glaring eyes of Mars.\n\n\"I told you, didn't I, Mr. Corbow?\"\n\nBronsen covered his ears so that he wouldn't hear. He screamed, \"Shut\nup! Shut up before I slam you one.\"\n\nMars spat in disgust. \"Four nice guys in that ship, too. Knew 'em,\ndidn't you?\"\n\nBronsen's hammer-hard first smashed into Mars' mouth and the old man\nwas slammed against the wall before falling in a crumpled heap on the\nfloor. He sat there, the blood oozing from his mouth as he stared at\nthe retreating back of the man he never thought would have enough nerve\nto really hit him. Now he was sorry he had said anything and the self\npity welled up within him. He really didn't mean half of what he always\nmanaged to spit out. What made him do it? He wiped the blood from his\nmouth and pulled himself to his feet.\n\n\n\nBronsen slumped further down into the soft contours of the chair,\neyeing Hanson Reed with a tortured soul. The president of Inter\nGalactic Enterprises glared at him from the other side of the desk,\nevery inch of his paunchy frame the body of an outraged executive. He\nchewed violently on the black cigar in his mouth and waited impatiently\nfor Bronsen to explain. Bronsen spread his hands helplessly.\n\n\"I don't know Reed. I just don't know.\" His shoulders heaved in a sigh\nof dejection. \"Every single person in the moon lab has been looking\nfor an answer and we still can't find out why the ship crashed. We've\ntested the laboratory models over and over again. We've gone over every\nlittle detail and have nothing but a blank to show for it.\"\n\nReed chewed more savagely at the end of his cold cigar. \"We spent two\nmillion dollars on research and development and all _we_ have to show\nfor it is a pile of scrap metal and four corpses scattered over the\nlunar landscape. There's got to be some explanation.\"\n\n\"Just one in a million chances that an accident like this would\nhappen,\" Bronsen countered desperately. \"It's just coincidence that it\nhappened on the first model.\"\n\n\"Coincidence!\" Mars' voice was guttural with contempt. \"I told you from\nthe start it wasn't practical. I knew....\"\n\n\"All right, Mars,\" Reed interrupted. \"You were project design engineer,\nright?\" Mars nodded in agreement. \"Was there anything wrong with the\ndesign of the ship, any reason why it probably wouldn't have worked,\nfrom a design stand-point?\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered reluctantly. \"Not that I could see. I just knew from\nthe start it wasn't going to work. I told Bronsen that, lots of times,\nbut he just isn't the type to take advice.\"\n\nBronsen roared and leaped to his feet.\n\n\"You old fool,\" he bellowed. \"Technically, theoretically and\nmechanically, there wasn't one indication that it wasn't going to be\na completely successful launching procedure. You know that as well as\nanyone! Ask the men around you. They handled the final application, the\nmechanics, the construction, the blast off. Ask any one of them. Every\nsingle one of them will tell you the same thing. There was no reason\nwhy the ship should have crashed! Every item had been checked, double\nchecked and re-checked again. The instruments indicated everything was\nfunctioning perfectly at blast off. If you didn't have such a twisted\ninverted opinion of everything....\"\n\nMars leaned forward, his body now trembling, \"Don't you go calling me\nnames, you swell-headed pup!\"\n\nReed pounded his desk violently.\n\n\"Mars! Bronsen!\" he shouted impatiently. \"This is hardly the time for\nname-calling and airing personal gripes. We're here to find a good\nreason for spending more money on this project. We're not children in a\nschoolyard, arguing over a piece of candy, although that's exactly what\nit's beginning to sound like. Frankly, I'm of the opinion that with\nso much internal fighting going on, nothing could possibly come of\nspending more. It would be a waste of both finances and time.\"\n\nBronsen slowly sat down again, his trembling hands clenched into tight\nfists.\n\n\"That's one item you don't have to worry about,\" he growled. \"Kenton is\ncompletely finished as far as I'm concerned. He's out. Fired.\"\n\nMars' face fell in shocked surprise. Reed tore the cigar from his mouth\nand glared at Bronsen.\n\n\"No one is being fired, Bronsen. You've been a good leader, in my\nopinion, as well as a friend, but I do the firing around here.\" Bronsen\nglowered and reddened under the unexpected rebuttal but said nothing.\n\"You are young yet,\" Reed continued. \"You've got brains, imagination,\nleadership and ability. Wouldn't be where you are if you didn't.\nThere's just one thing lacking, and Mars is the one that has it.\nExperience. And with that experience goes well-used caution. You've got\nthe go-ahead, but he has the wisdom. Temperance and drive. That's Mars\nand you. You've got each other. Why don't you just learn how to work\nwith and use each other?\"\n\nBronsen remained in baleful silence. Mars glared at the younger man and\nsneered contemptuously.\n\n\"That young pup never will know what the word caution means. He's so\neager to get his name up....\"\n\nBronsen rose to his feet, his grey eyes flashing in hate. Reed slammed\nhis cigar into the ashtray and threw up his hands.\n\n\"That's it! It's the last straw! I'm through playing referee for two\nsnarling dogs. The project is closed, finished! If and when somebody\ncan come up with a decent reason why it should be opened again, we'll\nconsider it then. Until that time, consider the project non-existent\nand return to your regular jobs. And cut out the bickering and\nfighting--or you are both fired!\"\n\nHe pulled out a fresh cigar, bit into it in disgust and dismissed\nthe meeting by returning to the papers on his desk. Bronsen felt the\nanger boiling over within him and suppressed the desire to hand in his\nresignation on the spot. He looked for Mars and saw his thin frame out\nthe door. He wearily passed a hand over his eyes and left the room.\n\n\n\nMars scowled in annoyance at Vern's whistling and silently wished the\nyoung assistant would get out of the room and let him brood in peace.\nHe chewed the end of his pencil methodically and savagely, his features\nblushing pink with anger as he remembered the tirade of words exchanged\nwith Bronsen a week ago. \"Stupid, insolent, day-dreaming pup,\" he\nsnarled half aloud.\n\nVern stopped in mid-step, eyeing him in surprise. \"Huh?\" he said. \"Did\nyou say something to me?\"\n\nMars grimaced. \"No. I was just talking to myself.\"\n\nVern grinned widely. \"That's good. I'd sure hate to have anybody think\nthose words were a description of me. Good old Vern, that's me.\nCombination office boy, slave, master of ceremonies and soothing balm\nfor ruffled egos. That's my description of me. Master of all trades,\nJack of none. Of course, I can't say what others think.\"\n\n\"You don't make much sense,\" Mars growled thickly, biting again into\nthe pencil.\n\n\"Neither do you,\" Vern countered quickly. \"But then again, what man\ndoes to a struggling young genius like myself?\"\n\n\"Oh dry up,\" came the reply. \"And take that drawing table into the new\ndrafter's room.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure. You only need about three men to move that monster but....\"\nHe left the sentence unfinished and dragged the table from the wall.\nMars smiled sympathetically, shook his head, and pointed to his bad leg\nwhen Vern indicated he could use some help.\n\n\"Such is the life of a slave,\" the younger man sighed and hoisting the\nclumsy article, headed for the door.\n\n\"Look out!\" Mars suddenly yelled and jumped forward to catch a falling\nrocket model as the table edge glanced off it. Vern yelped in surprise,\njolted backward and fell against the wall, the heavy board crashing\ndown on his foot.\n\n\"My God, Vern. Your foot....\"\n\nThe other grinned, withdrew his foot from beneath the board and pulled\ndown his sock. \"Not this baby,\" he flipped. \"I've got cast-iron\ninsurance. It's plastic from the ankle down, see?\"\n\nMars stared in shock at the artificial limb and could think of nothing\nvery brilliant to say.\n\n\"Got it in cadet school,\" Vern explained and then answered the question\nin Mars' eyes. \"I was training to be a space pilot myself. Some fellows\nand I decided to celebrate our graduation, got drunk and ended up in a\nwreck. They put me together real good, even taught me how to use the\nfoot so no one would ever know it wasn't the real thing. It washed\nme out as far as the Space Corps was concerned though. I drowned my\nsorrows in alcohol for a couple weeks, told myself I was going to hell\nwith myself and then decided to put what I did know to work. That's how\nI joined up with this outfit. Now I sit back and design the rockets my\nclassmates have to worry about flying.... Enough of this chatter ...\ngot to get busy. See you.\"\n\nMars turned thoughtfully back to his desk. \"That kid's got only one\nfoot,\" he mused soberly. He looked down at his own injured leg and\nsavagely kicked it against the wall.\n\n\"Your leg. Your poor, crippled leg ... what a fine crutch it has been,\"\nhe bitterly reproached himself. \"It proves you were one of the first in\nspace, and you won't let people forget it. You're a jealous old man.\nYou're afraid to have someone else do what you no longer can do. You\nwant things to stay the way they were when you got hurt, so no one else\ncan live your dream. If time stood still, there would be no trips to\nnew planets, no new discoveries and Mars Kenton would still be the hero\nof his dream.\"\n\nHe tried to revolt, to denounce the self-accusations. \"What about\nBronsen Corbow?\" he asked. \"Does that explain why I've fought him so\nhard?\"\n\nHis slowly growing conscience laughed at him. \"But it does. Bronsen\nignores your crutch, your proof that the old way worked the best. He's\nconcerned with the future, the future you never want to come.\" He\nburied his grey-thatched head in his hands and felt the weariness in\nhis bones. His thoughts returned to the unsuccessful launching.\n\n\"But it was a crazy idea,\" he argued weakly. \"It would never have\nworked anyway.\" It was a poor defense, one that faltered and failed\nwhen he finally admitted the truth: He was a jealous, bitter man,\nfighting anonymity.\n\nOnce more he found himself mulling over the rocket launching, probing\nfor support to his initial decision that it wouldn't work, searching\nfor some point to substantiate his claim. But was he really right in\nthat decision? Had he let his hate-ridden heart rule his reasoning\nmind? He waded back to the beginning of Bronsen's theory. Bullets ...\nthe test models were the bullets. Shells ... the huge rocket itself\nwas a shell compared to the bullets. Shells have an ojive, bourrelet,\nrotating band, but bullets are different. How? He stopped. He reviewed\nthe parts in his mind, then suddenly lurched to the files and pulled\nout the rocket plans. He compared the ship's construction bit by\nbit with a shell, his mind working quickly, accurately, with a new\nenthusiasm....\n\nHours later he leaned back from his drawing table and his voice rumbled\nout into the quiet reaches of the empty room.\n\n\"Men will fly to the stars like a bullet,\" he prophesized. \"Because I\nknow why the rocket crashed.\"\n\nIt was dark but the light in Bronsen's office was still on. Mars pulled\nhimself erect and turned toward Bronsen's room, then faltered. \"I could\njust forget it,\" he mused. \"Then the idea would be filed away. But\nsomeday....\" He could not do it. The excitement was beginning to mount\ninside of him, pushing him forward. He took a deep breath and with a\ndecisive shrug drew back his shoulders, standing straighter and taller\nthan he had in fifteen long years. He strode from the room and headed\ndown the hall.\n\nBronsen heard the door behind him open and close softly. He glanced up\nand saw who it was and returned, scowling, to his work. When Mars did\nnot leave, he looked up again, curiosity stirring within him at the\nexpression in the older man's face.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nIt wasn't really a question, nor an inflection denoting that he wanted\nto hear what Mars had to say. It was more of a compromise between\nphysically throwing him out and grudgingly listening to what he had to\nsay.\n\n\"I've got it, I know what happened to the ship,\" Mars announced\nquietly. \"I knew it when I saw it come out of the launcher but I\ncouldn't explain it.\" Bronsen returned to his papers with a snort and\nMars pleaded, \"I'm sorry about all those things I said. For God's sake.\nListen to me!\"\n\nThe tortured pleading in the man's voice made Bronsen put down the\npapers in surprise.\n\n\"The models worked,\" Mars plunged ahead. \"Sure they did. But because\nthey were small ... so much smaller than the real ship ... there was no\ntrouble and they worked perfectly. The trouble reveals itself only as\nthe projectile gets larger. The nose, Bronsen. A nose band. Don't you\nsee what I'm trying to say?\"\n\nThe younger man stared in silence at the pleading ex-space pilot,\nbefore the words began to penetrate his whirling thoughts. He forgot\nthe crash of the ship; he forgot the feel of hard teeth splitting the\nskin across his knuckles; he forgot the animosity that existed between\nthem. His mind could focus on nothing but what Mars was trying to say.\n\n\"The nose of the ship is long. The only guides were on the tail at\nthe rotating band. Think of shells. Bourrelets. The _big_ shells have\nbourrelets ... bands around the nose that dig into the grooves and\nsteady the front of the shell. The ship ... its front began trembling\nbecause there was nothing to guide the nose in a steady path. The more\nvelocity the rocket had, the worse the trembling became until it threw\nthe whole ship out of control. Don't you see? That's all that was\nwrong with it! It would have been perfect if it had had guide wings\non the bourrelet. The guide pieces could be withdrawn when the ship\nis launched ... but they would have to be there in order to _get_ it\nlaunched. I'm right, you know I am! That's your answer. That was the\nonly part wrong with it!\"\n\nThe enormity of Mars' words left Bronsen speechless. He looked at the\nsuddenly joyous man before him and saw the old bitterness replaced by\nthe rapture of his discovery. Yes, that was what had been wrong. It\nwas the solution ... the one tiny piece that made the puzzle into an\nunderstandable picture. He paused a moment, as if trying to make a\ngreat decision, then grabbed the older man by the arm.\n\n\"Come on! Let's get it down on paper!\"\n\n\n\nThe rocket lay huddled in the belly of the launching tower, her\nneedle-like body quiet, waiting, her control panels flashing signals\nand instructions to her masters, her circuits buzzing with the\ntenseness of the seconds before blast off. The steady counting drummed\nthrough her wires, tripped relays, and her masters flipped the\nswitches, pressed the buttons and pulled the levers that readied her\nfor her maiden flight. Eight seconds, seven seconds. Six seconds, five,\nfour. The switch was jerked upward and she felt the power beginning to\nmove in her vitals.\n\n_Three, two, one!_\n\nThe driver button slammed home, her rockets roared out in ferocious\nbirth, snarling, roaring, growing with each passing second. She\nsettled back upon her rockets as if in protest at their screaming\ngrowth, then was forced to give ground and the ship moved up the shaft.\nHer rotating band and bourrelet fins dug deep into the spiraling\ngrooves, her body began to turn ... slowly, so slowly. Then she\nsuddenly leaped forward, her hull whirling upward; the shaft raced\nby in dizzy swiftness, her rockets roared louder and she raised her\nspinning body further. She was free! Her body hurtled up and up, her\nneedle nose straight and true, her velocity leaping forward....\n\n\"Off rockets! Set up emergency interstellar drive for instant\nactivation if needed. Signal in scanning screens. Activate force field\nand take a breather, boys. We're on our way and the blast off was\nperfect.\"\n\nThe pilot's mechanical sounding voice droned through the speaker in the\nmoon-bound observation room and simultaneously the air was ruffled by\nthe deep exhale of relief, the rustle of slowly relaxing bodies strung\ntight with the hopeful tenseness of the blast off.\n\nMars gazed up at the disappearing silver streak, his blue eyes intent,\nglistening with pride and excitement. \"I never thought I'd see the\nday,\" he breathed. \"Look at her, she's going straight and true. She's\nthe most beautiful thing I ever saw.\"\n\nBronsen's face relaxed into a happy grin as the gleaming rocket hurtled\nup out of sight. He glanced at Mars and gave him a companionable smile.\n\n\"Even more beautiful than Mars that day? Or the old rockets?\"\n\nMars looked slightly embarrassed and shuffled his legs into a more\ncomfortable position. \"Aw hell,\" he said awkwardly. \"Can't you forget\nan old fool's ramblings? We just watched a rocket launched that's going\nto open up a whole new era in space travel. It was a perfect blast off\nand we know it'll be a perfect trip and landing.\"\n\nBronsen thoughtfully nodded his head, his grey eyes dancing.\n\n\"Tell you what,\" Mars continued. \"I've got a bottle that I've been\nsaving for about fifteen years. Got it when we got back from that first\ntrip and never opened it.\"\n\nBronsen grinned and gave the old man's thin shoulder a hearty slap.\n\n\"Let's get that drink!\"",
