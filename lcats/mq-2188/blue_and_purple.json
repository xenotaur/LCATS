Persia holds\nnot a fragrance so heavenly in its perfumed bowers.\nOh, my wondrous love, pour thy scented charm into\nthe chalice of my longing heart; fill with thy fresh\nsplendour the air I breathe; and give me youth to\nspend on thee, my well-beloved. I am the gardener,\nborn to tend one flower. My flower is the radiance of\na dawn in June. Like a veil of glowing pearls my love\nspreads her light; she is my morning, my joy of perfect\nhours. I will sing to her the song fresh roses raise\nfrom their delicious petals when night departs and\nthey rejoice, sun-kissed, when all the east is rich in\ngold. Lovely is my bloom. Her soul is the first blossom\ngiven by Him who made the loveliness of Spring._\n\n\n\n\nBLUE AND PURPLE\n\n\n\n\nIN BLUE AND PURPLE CLAD\n\n\nA pearl set in the hollow of a stone,\n  Wrought deftly by an artist of great skill;\n  A sapphire \u2019twas that bore the pearl so still\nWithin its bosom; taking from its tone\n\nThose fires of deep delight to Asia known.\n  Blent in an amethyst, the priceless twain\n  Enthron\u00e8d were, o\u2019er glowing worlds to reign,\nIn gladness richer than the morn has shown.\n\nShe, like a regal lily of the field,\nOn which the sunset colours softly lay,\nForgot that life was sometime dark and sad;\nShe smiled, and bade all sorrow\u2019s wounds be healed;\nThen she was lovelier than heav\u2019n\u2019s best day--\nEthereal, in blue and purple clad.\n\n\n\n\nFAR HORIZONS\n\n\nWe stand upon the barren shore,\n  And look far out to sea,\nThe crooning waves their burden pour\n  On you and me.\n\nOur longing eyes, full of our mind,\n  On far horizons lie--\nThere, where our joy we hope to find\n  Before we die.\n\nHow fair the tempting journey seems--\n  Smooth lake of mystery--\nHow frail the craft, our forethought deems,\n  For such a sea!\n\nFor you and me, my lovely one,\n  And all our mighty hopes;\nOne step, dear love, and we have done,\n  And--cut the ropes?\n\nLashed to the past we stand, and fear\n  To leave our ties and pain;\nThough (speaks the soul, if we would hear)\n  Our loss is gain.\n\nFear blurs the vision of our dream,\n  Fear fills our hearts with dread,\nSoon we shall find upon life\u2019s stream\n  Our souls are dead.\n\nWe stand upon the shore and mourn;\n  We grieve, despairingly,\nTo leave the fetters we have borne--\n  So patiently.\n\nOr, do we grieve that we are weak,\n  Lack courage to be free,\nAnd spurn the liberty we seek\n  For slavery?\n\nDoubts lie--like pebbles on this strand--\n  In our sad souls, my mate.\nBefore us lies the promised land,\n  Behind us--fate.\n\nThen, let us here together bide,\n  With faces toward the sea,\nAnd hope that some fair morning\u2019s tide\n  Take you and me.\n\n\n\n\nHEBE\u2019S EYES\n\n\nThe light of Hebe\u2019s eyes\nGives colour to the skies,\nIt makes the azure dome\n  A radiant place,\nWhere love might find a home,\n  Sweet as her face.\n\nEthereal are the hues\nWhere birds a-wing would lose\nThemselves in heavenly bliss;\n  As I would do--\nIf I might soar to kiss\n  Her eyes so blue!\n\n\n\n\nSWEET FACE, I SEE THEE SHINE\n\n\nSweet face, I see thee shine\nOut of the bosom of the east at morn;\nThy tenderness, divine,\nLies mirrored in the pearly dew at dawn.\n\nThe flower that smiles at me,\nHolds in its cup the picture of your face;\nIn rivulets I see\nThe flowing charm of your abiding grace.\n\nThe sapling tells me how\nYour body\u2019s symmetry grows strong and straight;\nThe winds which whisper now,\nTell me your love and trust will not abate.\n\nThe steadfast stars above\nReflect the fervour of your constant mind,\nYour deep unwav\u2019ring love--\nThe rarest jewel eager man can find!\n\nIn nature\u2019s soul thou art--\nI see thee, hear thee, feel thee, ever near;\nDear love, thou art the heart\nOf those eternal joys our souls revere.\n\n\n\n\nTWO FLOWERS\n\n\n    I saw a bloom,\n    So beautiful,\nMy sad heart lost its gloom,\n    And cares that dull\nThe senses, soon passed far away--\nThe bloom brought joy into the day.\n\n    I saw her face\n    When she bent down\nAnd kissed the bloom. Then grace\n    Was Hebe\u2019s crown\nOf loveliness, and there! upon\nHer brow the light of heaven shone!\n\n\n\n\nTHE MUSIC OF MY HEART\n\n\nThe soft night, like a silent child\nBefore some wondrous thing,\nWithholds its breath, as if beguiled\nBy songs the fairies sing.\n\nIt seems to stand and listen, still\nAs statue in a grove--\nPerhaps it hears a fairy trill\nA strain Titania wove.\n\nAh, no, the night hears not her song,\nFor it would then be glad;\nAnd I have listened here so long,\nI know the night is sad.\n\nNow if it be a song that keep\nThe hour when night should part,\nThen night must hear from my soul\u2019s deep,\nThe music of my heart.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TRYST\n\n\nMy love is coming through green fields to me--\n  Why does she tarry so?\nShe knows I wait on cliffs above the sea,\n  And dare not to her go;\nFor I am prisoned to the spot where love\nHas chained my feet, and must not call or move.\n\nMy love is gath\u2019ring harebells, where the mead\n  Is starred with flowers to kiss\nHer ling\u2019ring feet; there sedges intercede,\n  And whisper runes of bliss--\nBeseeching her to stay and heed me not--\nFor she can make a heaven of any spot!\n\nMy love is list\u2019ning to the skylark\u2019s song,\n  Delight is in her ears.\nShe cannot know her lover yearns so long,\n  And drinks his salty tears\nTo quench his thirst for all her winsome grace--\nHer absence makes a desert of the place.\n\nMy love is drinking in the air which blows\n  The perfumes of the sea,\nThe journeying breeze wafts past me--well she knows--\n  Though me she cannot see!\n\nHer lovely eyes, the yearning west would woo,\nLook not on me while blooms in green fields sue.\n\nShe knows \u2019tis deathless love that holds me fast,\n  Chained to this rock so grim;\nThat I shall wait for her, until the last\n  Sun sets o\u2019er ocean\u2019s rim.\nThat flowers shall die and green fields fade and sear,\nEre I forsake the tryst to greet her here.\n\n\n\n\nNATURE\u2019S LOVELINESS\n\n\nYes, everywhere I go\nI see the constant flow\n  Of nature\u2019s loveliness--\nBut, oh, if I could see\nThese scenes, my love, with thee,\n  How bright would be their dress!\n\nI can no more rejoice\nWithout your gracious voice\n  Exulting in my ear,\nAnd nature, too, requires\nYour soulful, ardent fires,\n  To beautify the year.\n\nThe tender blooms turn pale\nWhen I, alone, through vale\n  And gully, searching pass;\nThey seem to say to me,\n\u201cWhere is your mate? for we\n  Bloom only for your lass.\u201d\n\nMy worship in the glen\nGoes up for naught, dear, when\n  I stand alone in prayer;\nThe sea, the dunes, the trees,\nChide me, and every breeze\n  Sings lamentation there.\n\nNo, nothing in this world\nWhere gales and snows have whirled\n  A joyous tempest down--\nWhich spread a carpet fine\nFor thee to tread, can shine\n  As your belov\u00e8d crown.\n\nThey do not envy you,\nThey love the sweet, the true--\n  They know you are sincere\nAs morning\u2019s spark of light\nIn dew orbs shining bright,\n  When heaven is blue and clear.\n\nThey want your merry laugh,\nLike rain for them to quaff;\n  They want to kiss your feet;\nThey want to see your eyes--\nFull glory of blue skies--\n  Your smile they yearn to greet.\n\nCome to the woods, my own,\nWith every blessing known\n  To man, which you can bring;\nHere is your royal goal,\nCome, with your joyous soul,\n  And make all nature sing!\n\n\n\n\nYOU\n\n\nWhat is this mystery?\nThis subtle wonder--you?\nWhich fills my soul with ecstasy,\nMy eyes with dew?\nWhat are you, influence, so mild?\nAs subtle as the air which sways\nThe stalwart pine. What child\nOf nature are you?\nSoul obeys your slightest motion.\nMind is set in deep commotion--\nBy your presence--\nBy your absence--\nBeing thrills beneath your glance!\nA smile will all my thought enhance.\nTouch my lips, and every bliss\nSeeks heaven\u2019s glory in a kiss!\nYou! sweet influence, what art\nGod used in fashioning you apart\nFrom His renown\u00e8d mould,\nIn the marvellous days of old?\nWhy, all the elements combined\nIn making you\nThe dearest mystery refined,\nThe ages through!\nYet, what are you? with power\nSo great to bind my will,\nFast in strong chains each hour;\nAnd every action fill\nWith echoes of one name,\nResounding in love\u2019s hall of fame?\nYou! Unlike your kind--\nAn essence of God\u2019s mind.\nAn attribute of His deep joy,\nWhen in his toil of love\nHe fashioned you without alloy,\nThe masterpiece to prove,\nWith every splendid gift--replete.\nYou--complete!\nMy earth, sky, sea, and air;\nMy fruit, flower, jewel rare;\nMy every need of day and night--\nSun, moon, stars, space; my soul\u2019s delight!\nYour name whose syllables are wings\nWhich waft me high,\nAbove the fragrant air which brings\nFaint eastern aromatics to the sky.\nEver a mystery of art to be,\nA subtle influence subjecting me.\nLike, fair Hamadryad, created anew--\nIneffable, mystical, wonderful--you!\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAST LIGHT\n\n\nThe foothills of Nebraska shine\n  In a disc of sunset gold;\nThe cornstalks glisten like pale wine--\n  But the wind is bitter cold.\n\nAround my love a radiance lies,\n  \u2019Tis the glow of her soul\u2019s sun;\n\u2019Twill light a vision in my eyes--\n  When the long day\u2019s work is done.\n\n\n\n\nWHEN YOU WERE BORN\n\n\nLove stirred the spheres,\nThe groves rang mirth--\nThere were no tears--\nAt my love\u2019s birth!\n\nA dancing star\nIn revel flashed;\nThen leaped afar--\nAnd earthward dashed.\n\nIn bliss it showered\nA million joys--\nSweet wishes flowered\nIn girls and boys.\n\nThen back it went,\nWith soaring dance,\nAnd darkness rent\nIn merry prance.\n\nThe dawn\u2019s grey spires\nCleft night\u2019s blue deep,\nThen golden fires\nConsumed dawn\u2019s keep.\n\nA lark then flew\nWith joy on high--\nWith pearly dew--\nUp to the sky.\n\nAnd gave its kiss\nTo its dear mate,\nIn flutt\u2019ring bliss,\nAt heaven\u2019s gate.\n\nSo rosy morn\nSubdued the night,\nWhen you were born,\nMy joy\u2019s delight!\n\n\n\n\nFORTUNE, YOU HAVE NAUGHT I NEED\n\n\nFortune, you have naught I need;\nFame cannot appease me;\nFlowery beds grow but a weed;\nLaughter cannot please me.\nLovely roses win no smile,\nFrom my drooping spirit;\nLarks a song may sing the while,\nI will never hear it.\nMusic rich, on which I throve,\nLeaves me worn and weary;\nSoftest tunes of vernal grove\nSeem so trite and dreary.\nI am hard to please, I know,\nNothing wins my pleasure;\nLet the golden rivers flow,\nI disdain their treasure.\nHeaven itself may shine in vain,\nIt will cheer me never,\nLet it glow, or blow, or rain,\nCrack, and timbers sever.\nLet me seek the fallow way,\nHating mirth and sorrow,\nWanting not this dreary day,\nGive me bright tomorrow!\nDay is dark as longest night,\nHours are without number;\nWakeful night in its slow flight,\nRids me of my slumber.\nWeary, weary world, ah! me,\nWhat is that I cry for?\nOnly love to come to me--\nThat is what I sigh for!\nOnly Hebe, lovely one,\nShe of loves the rarest--\nGive me my beloved sun,\nLight to me the fairest!\n\n\n\n\nLET US MAKE A GARDEN\n\n\nCome, let us make a garden, mate of mine,\nA patch of rich brown earth the Spring will green;\nI, with a spade and fork; you, with a line\nAnd plan, will set it out for heaven\u2019s bright sheen\n\nTo cover, when the warm days come again.\nCome, now the snows are melting, and the soil\nIs drinking down the draughts of winter\u2019s pain;\nLet us dig in our hopes with jocund toil!\n\nThe smell of fresh-turned loam will give us strength,\nThe work will brace our souls for greater tasks;\nOur plan will bring us days of happy length,\nAnd take from us the tribute summer asks.\n\nCome, now the stubborn frost is yielding fast,\nAnd bathe our bodies in the softer airs,\nWhich blow from kinder climes now winter\u2019s past,\nAnd sleet and hail are gone to their white lairs.\n\nWith hopes of lovely blooms to gather soon,\nCome, make a garden, mate of mine, with me,\nSo we may go rejoicing in warm June,\nAnd all the glories of God\u2019s bounty see.\n\nCome, mate of mine, and make a garden bright\nIn my sad heart, for snows are melting there,\nBring to it all your joys of warmth and light,\nAnd bid it bloom, and never more be bare.\n\n\n\n\nSANCTUARY\n\n\nWhere the peace of even lies,\nAnd the low\u2019ring purples rest,\nUnder amethystine skies,\nIs the mystery of the West.\n\nIn the colour-blending shroud\nOf the glories of the heat,\nWhere the myriad tones of cloud\nGlow and fade in their retreat,\n\nThere the soul of peace lies still,\nIn the secret of the eve,\nIn the shadows of the hill,\nWhere the colours spin and weave\n\nAll the textures for the skies,\nAll the yearnings of the heart,\nAll the gleams in lovely eyes--\nIn the wonder-colour part\n\nLies the soul of peace. And thou!\nDearest mystery of my life,\nWith thy colours me endow,\nIn the murk and gloom of strife.\n\nRadiant! Clothe me in thy soul--\nSanctuary of my rest.\nLet thy mingling colours roll,\nDeep, around me in thy West.\n\n\n\n\nSTARS\n\n\nTen thousand lights were gleaming there,\n  A million stars were bright--\nBut, oh, my darling\u2019s face was fair\n  On that entrancing night.\n\nThe world looked up and saw the skies,\n  In lovely colour shine--\nI looked into my darling\u2019s eyes,\n  And all the world was mine.\n\n\n\n\nREJUVENATION\n\n\nAre you the wondrous joy of Spring,\nSent coursing through the woods,\nWith chorals for the birds to sing,\nAnd colors for the buds?\n\nOr are you some supreme delight,\nWhich morn set free with mirth,\nTo carry gladness in your flight\nAll o\u2019er the meads of earth?\n\nWhat are you, Hebe, nymph or maid?\nYou start Spring in my heart\nWith blooms that time can never fade--\nRejuvenating art.\n\nWhat witchery, like Spring, is this\nYou hold o\u2019er me, sweet one?\nYou set me glowing with a kiss\nWith warmth of summer sun.\n\nAs winter thaws when spring comes in\nWith claims to warmth and growth,\nSo you from cold my soul doth win--\nPour in it best of both.\n\nI rise from dreary hours and smile\nAt sorrow when you call,\nAnd thrill with youthful yearnings while\nYour blisses on me fall.\n\n\u2019Tis magic! \u2019Tis the art of joy,\nTransforming way of Spring;\nHer methods, Hebe, you employ\nTo make my young heart sing.\n\n\n\n\nA SONG\n\n\nI love her for her tenderness,\n  Her sweet abiding grace,\nHer gentle spirit\u2019s loveliness,\n  Her earnest, winsome face!\n\nI love her for her happy ways,\n  Her body\u2019s wondrous bloom,\nHer smiles which light the heavy days,\n  And straight dispel my gloom!\n\nI love her for her honest speech--\n  Her constant soul\u2019s delight--\nHer honeyed lips the gods would teach\n  To kiss their loves aright!\n\nI love her for she kept for me,\n  Those lips where perfect bliss\nAwaits in reddening ecstasy\n  Her lover\u2019s eager kiss!\n\n\n\n\nHEBE\n\n\nHebe is a mystery,\nMoving in a woman\u2019s guise,\nThrough a silent sacristy--\nHoly as her lovely eyes.\n\nHebe is a magnet strong,\nDrawing strength from strength each day,\nShe is like a glorious song,\nGrowing sweeter in its sway;\n\nMelting mind and heart at first,\nThrilling all the senses whole,\n\u2019Til in its melodic burst,\nLeaps triumphant o\u2019er the soul.\n\nHebe is enchanting when\nAll the world seems most awry;\nShe smiles brightly o\u2019er me, then\nEarth is gone and heaven is nigh.\n\nHebe is both pro and con--\nShe is understanding\u2019s own.\nWas there ever paragon\nSuch as she to scholars known?\n\nShe is younger than her youth,\nShe is older than her race,\nShe is clearer than the truth,\nTender as her winsome face.\n\nNature\u2019s contradiction she,\nTurning science upside down;\nShe is Love\u2019s own mystery,\nFrom her heel up to her crown.\n\nHebe is all things of joy:\nShe is joy--joy was forgot\n\u2019Til she came, here to employ\nLover\u2019s arts the Greeks knew not.\n\nShe is supple, strong, and sweet;\nShe is full of gentle mirth--\nHappy are her splendid feet,\nThey are worthy of the earth.\n\nShe is sportive as a child,\nShe is wise as she is kind,\nWith a temper firm yet mild,\nShe controls her earnest mind.\n\nTears may fall as drenching rain,\nShe will make each tear a pearl,\nAnd the heart when full of pain,\nShe can set in joyful whirl.\n\nWho records this maid of bliss?\nI, who love her every act.\nGreater myst\u2019ry yet is this:\nHebe is a splendid fact.\n\n\n\n\nSPRING\n\n\nLet us go\nWhile Spring\u2019s delicious breezes blow,\nAnd see the dunes and sedges grow\nGreen, white, and red--\nNow Winter\u2019s sped--\nAnd all the moorland is aglow.\n\nLet us feel\nThe magic breath of springtime steal\nOn us, and everywhere reveal\nThe joyous strife\nOf bursting life,\nAnd hear the bells of heaven peal.\n\nLet us see\nThe busy songsters\u2019 ecstasy,\nAnd hear them pipe their songs of glee--\nFor all the day\nThey seem to say,\nThe soul is happy that is free!\n\nLove, divine,\nArt thou not Spring, and give me wine\nTo quaff? For in this heart of mine\nA new life grows,\nAnd yields a rose\nFor thee--the fragrance of it thine!\n\nHebe, dear,\nThe message of this Spring day hear;\nSee, love, the glory of the year:\nThe Spring is free,\nSo Summer be\nThe season in which joy is clear!\n\n\n\n\nTHE FAY\n\n\nIn blue, cerise, and grey,\nA dainty, bonnie thing--\nNo mortal--just a fay,\nFrom elfin glades astray,\nWith joys the swallows bring\nWhen they come back with spring.\n\nShe came with lovely mien--\nThe charms of fairy\u2019s art--\nNo winsomer was seen,\nNot Titania, her queen.\nShe flew into my heart\nTo rest, and ne\u2019er depart.\n\nMy heart is beating high--\nThe fay is singing there.\nBlest tenant, tell me why,\nOf mortals, why am I\nThe happy one to dare\nMake captive, fay so rare?\n\nShe answered in a song,--\nSo soft and sweet the tune--\n\u201cPray, why? Have I done wrong\nTo hide in heart so strong?\nWhere I may place the boon\nOf all the joys of June?\u201d\n\nOh, winsome, witching sprite,\nWho like a mortal came,\nIn robe of tender light,\nTo make my hours so bright;\nWho brought me Love\u2019s dear fame,\nTo warm me at its flame.\n\n\n\n\nA SONG\n\n\nMy love is morning\u2019s fragrance blown\nFrom blossoms fair in golden June;\nHer footstep\u2019s rhythm is in tune\nWith melodies by Springtime known.\nHer misty locks are like the May,\nOn pearly hedges lightly thrown;\nA sweeter face was never shown\nTo man that he might face the day!\nO beauty, tender, like the moon\nOf summer nights, which gently lay\nOn lovers when their hearts were gay,\nAnd deep desire was at its noon.\n\n\n\n\nTHE GARDENER\n\n\nI see her in the blooming field,\n  Where winds sport in the grass,\nAnd petals of the Summer yield\n  Sweet perfumes to my lass.\n\nI see her gather flowers so bright,\n  They almost match her face,\nWhose rapture is my soul\u2019s delight--\n  There I shall find God\u2019s grace.\n\nAh, grace of mercy to me flows\n  When I look in her eyes;\nHer soul of love and beauty glows,\n  And my life sanctifies.\n\nShe is so simple in her joys,\n  So childlike in her ways;\nWhen she the golden hour employs,\n  In off\u2019ring nature praise.\n\nShe lifts the roots to plant again,\n  In some sequestered spot,\nWhere they may know a fairer reign,\n  And beautify her plot--\n\nThere, thrive from culture of her hand,\n  Aim to engage her smile,\nDelight in blooming o\u2019er the land\n  Where she will tread the while.\n\nSo God His wonders has revealed\n  Through her, what growth can be,\nAnd in the process I am healed\n  Of blindness, and can see\n\nThat all the fields and woods are full,\n  Of glories rich and rare--\nWhen she a little flower will pull,\n  And set it in her hair.\n\n\n\n\nREVELATION\n\n\nI see no beauty shining in the east\nAt dawn, nor when the glowing sun has risen,\nAnd shot a million rays into night\u2019s prison--\nNo lovely scene on which my eyes would feast.\nAnd in the west at eve I see no light\nThat enters my whole being like a flash\nOf bursting joy--swift sky rent ere the crash\nOf kissing clouds acclaim their passion\u2019s might.\n\nMy eyes have seen the marvel of the world,\nAll joys transfigured into mighty bliss--\nThe great creative moment, sight divine,\nWhen earth, and sky, and sea, were torn and hurled\nApart, to yield her soul\u2019s ecstatic kiss,\nWhich shed all beauty \u2019neath one glance of mine.\n\n\n\n\nTHE KEEPER OF THE KISSES\n\n\nThe keeper of the kisses sleeps--\n  No sigh of mine can wake her;\nIn slumber all my joy she keeps--\n  My eyes will not forsake her!\n\nAll night I wait and watch her rest,\n  And yearn for those deep blisses,\nWhich are withheld from those unblest,\n  By her who keeps the kisses.\n\nOh, keeper of the kisses, rise\n  And now, at morn, uprender\nThe key which locks your lips and eyes,\n  And give me kisses tender.\n\nThe birds are waiting, and the flowers--\n  All spring your kisses needing;\nThe burning stars, the fainting hours,\n  The earth for joy is pleading.\n\nSee, her soft couch is moss and blooms,\n  All sweet with perfumes blowing;\nAnd lover like myself assumes,\n  The flowers for her are growing.\n\nNow if she wake with rosy dawn,\n  When all the east be singing,\nWill every nightingale be drawn\n  To her with bluebells ringing?\n\nShe sleeps, and knows not how we yearn,\n  For bliss she only grants us;\nFor her the sun and sky doth burn!\n  The lark is up, and chants thus:\n\n\u201cOh, keeper of the kisses, wake!\n  Unlock your lips by smiling,\nAnd let adoring mortals take\n  The joys of your beguiling.\n\n\u201cFor what is love without your lips?\n  A life that is not merry.\nThe bee that every honey sips,\n  Prefers the dimpled cherry.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nMUSIC IN HADES\n\n\nThe blackbird\u2019s note on Spring\u2019s first morn,\n  Is not so sweet as my love\u2019s voice,\nHer music, like a song re-born,\n  For great Eurydice\u2019s own choice--\n\nNay, Orpheus gave not to the shades,\n  To win his love, such minstrelsy,\nAs my dear love, whose song pervades\n  The hell from which she set me free.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DREAM\n\n\nBeauty waking from a vivid dream,\nAll warm, and soft, and tender,\nHer eyes with happiness agleam--\nOutstretched her arms, so slender.\nHer face a picture full of wonder--\nHer lips of gushing love asunder.\nMy lovely mistress, then ensouled,\nWrapped in the gown of rosy sleep,\nThrust back the curtained haze, and rolled\nAside the mists of slumber deep.\n\nSweetly she murmured to her lover: \u201cBoy,\nI dreamed a dream all joy!\nThere, in a thicket, caught by thorns,\nA bird, which morning\u2019s glow adorns,\n(It was not hurt, but tangled there,\nAnd struggled to be free)\nA yellow bright canary!\nIt whistled sweet to me--\nI thought it was a fairy.\nIn golden robes so rare,\nUntil I stretched my hand,\nAnd saw it spread its wings.\nThen, not in fairyland,\nI thought an elf (though each one sings)\nCould thrill so blithe a song,\nOr fly away so fast.\nI gave it liberty,\nTo live a life of joys both bright and long,\nIn one warm summer of days unsurpassed.\nThis dream of freedom came to me.\u201d\n\nJoy tinted every feature of her face,\nWarm blushes spread beneath the lace\nOf her fine robe, and pure delight\nSang in the phrases of her speech;\nShe lay, and told the story bright\nIn throbbing tones of happiness,\nSo wonderful was she, I would beseech\nSuch exquisite dear tenderness--\nSoft as the morning sun\u2019s serenest beams--\nWould come from all her dreams,\nAnd make my love so rosy,\nSo warm, so soft and cosy;\nSo clinging in her kisses,\nResplendent in those blisses\nOf trust, and hope, and courage fine,\nWhich shone in her like gleams of deep red wine!\nMy soul was never thrilled,\nAs it was then by her;\nMy eyes with tears were filled,\nFor joys so rare!\nLove surged like a sun-shaft up,\nTo drink deep bliss from heaven\u2019s cup!\n\u2019Twas like the poet\u2019s joy I feel,\nAs if her lovely soul were bare,\nAnd mine with it was there\nTo touch and heal\nItself, and all those blessings gain\nWhich God sends down on her like sweet, refreshing rain.\n\nBlest be her gracious head,\nSmooth be her smiling brow!\nMay Spring and Summer wed\nFor Hebe now,\nAnd shower--\nAye! every hour--\nThe fairest blossoms of the trees\nOn every fragrant gentle breeze,\nTo make soft paths for her dear feet,\nWhen she would in her sweet dreams greet\nHer fond, adoring mate,\nAt dreamland\u2019s gate.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BOON\n\n\nWhat is the dearest wish my soul can make?\n  What great desire can all this world bestow?\n  What is the very height of boon I know?\nWhat gift immeasurable I can take?\nIs there some precious thing for its own sake\n  My mind doth crave to make it strong and glow?\n  Is there some priceless treasure I might show,\nAnd make men from their rosy dreams awake?\n\nNo treasure this deep world can give I need.\n  My dearest wish no mighty king can give;\n    My great desire--no bauble that will cloy!\nI seek no gains on which ambitions feed!\n  Far more I seek; always to move and live\n    And have my being in my Hebe\u2019s joy.\n\n\n\n\nJACK O\u2019LANTERN\n\n\nFirefly! wait, but a moment, in your flight;\nStay, gleaming thing, and tell me of that night,\nWhen you were taken by a fairy hand,\nAnd cast into the grate to light the brand,\nIn that fair room of bliss and rosy dream.\nFor love of God! I pray you, moving beam\nOf light, stay, now my memory is woke--\nYou will not leave me now you do invoke\nMy thought to that dear night, long gone, when she,\nWith elfin joy, went out and captured thee.\n\nYou circle round my head, a band of flame--\nA light that fades as quickly as it came.\nO fickle fly, deny me not, come burn\nFor me, and let me from this torture turn;\nIn recollection\u2019s refuge seek relief\nFrom loneliness, the torn soul\u2019s awful grief.\nCome, bright or dark, do you but circle near,\nWhere you alone in night my words may hear.\n\nWhat of my love? My wondrous love, who caught\nYou winging that sweet night, as swift as thought,\nAnd threw you on the logs to start the fire,\nWhose gleams revealed to me my heart\u2019s desire?\nMatchless! all in her loveliness and grace--\nSoft as her humour, happy as her face.\n\nWhere is she now? Oh, where is my lost love,\nMy fairy mistress, gentle as a dove?\nDoes she in cockle leaves hide long night through,\nFearful of the clouds, shrinking from the dew?\nI never see her now! The fire no more\nIn flick\u2019ring rays lights up my sad heart\u2019s core.\nThere is no warmth in life now she is gone.\nThe sun disdains the man it shines upon.\nA wretched thing, bereft of all his joy,\nGoes wand\u2019ring through the night, where fays employ\nThe hours in dirges drear, and weirdly mourn\nFor her, their queen, long lost to fairy bourn.\n\nCome, Jack O\u2019Lantern, lead me to my mate--\nShe who alone can my distress abate,\nShe who will wipe all storms of grief away,\nShe whose dear radiance makes my perfect day!\nAlas! you heed me not, your lamp is out,\nYou hide away in darkness, black as doubt,\nYou light, to mock the faithful, false as hell,\nYou, in and out, you phosphorescent sell--\nI will have naught to do with you. Go, shine,\nAnd make a fool of souls less tough than mine.\n\nA weary round is day, and night is torn\nBy all the bitter conflicts day has worn;\nThe hours are full of shattered hopes, and pass\nWith ling\u2019ring tortures, writhing in the mass\nOf gloomy moods. I am no man of day,\nNor am I one the limpid night\u2019s soft ray\nWill fall upon to bless. No hour will claim\nMe for time\u2019s old companion. Yes, I shame\nThe ordinance of day, bright hours or dark,\nOne out of joint with all. The happy lark\nSings now no more for me. The flow\u2019ring dell\nNo longer blooms as she with cup and bell\nOnce did. For there is gone from out my life,\nMy matchless queen, my joy, my fairy wife.\n\nYou gleam no more, and yet on wing you roam,\nA firefly desolate, bereft of home\nAnd hearth, where logs might burn and shine at night,\nUpon the sweetest elf that did delight,\nBeyond excelling, mortal soul and mind.\nMay you, poor, searching, Jack O\u2019Lantern, find\nThe mistress of your fairy world in state.\nThen come, and take me to the shining grate,\nAnd I will bow allegiance, and renew\nLove, fealty, and homage, there with you.\n\n\n\n\nOH, TRANQUIL NIGHT\n\n\nOh, tranquil night, what spirit keeps thee still?\nDo whispering breezes taunt thy loneliness?\nOr art thou, too, numb, suffering keen distress,\nFor want of one warm kiss to break the chill\nOf patience, which pervades your watch sublime?\nThe stars are cold, mute company for thee,\nAnd cheerless is the ever-moaning sea--\nLong is the keep; a dreary watchman, Time.\n\n    Some soul is with you breathing out a balm,\n    A solace I know not tonight. What heed\n    Is taken of our tears which drench the sod?\n    Still there must be with thee a spirit calm,\n    Else would endurance break for aching need--\n    Such loneliness could not be braved by God!\n\n\n\n\nDESPAIR\n\n\nToo tough! The spirit will survive,\nIt keeps this mortal coil alive;\nLove too, that yearns to meet the day\nWhen you will come and with me stay.\n\nThere is no death that love can fear--\nLove never yet upon a bier\nLay in the sleep of death, for life\nIs stronger far than any strife.\n\nLove is the light which burns and shines\nWhen woe of spirit undermines\nThe thought, and our lives go awry,\nAnd days are long in passing by.\n\nLove is the spirit\u2019s soul, and glows\nThrough all the pain a mortal knows,\nAnd death cannot its might assail,\nNor bitterness its courage quail.\n\nDear love, my flesh cries out to thee,\nMy spirit\u2019s eyes her face would see,\nMy mind is mad for need of her,\nMy love is naked to the air.\n\n\n\n\nTO A PHOTOGRAPH\n\n\nHow sceptical you look tonight:\n    There is a sneer about your lips--\n    A moth is near them--see! it sips,\nAnd now rejoicing takes to flight.\nOh moth, I envy you that kiss;\n    My lips are arid strangers now.\n    Oh, I would take to flight, I vow,\nIf I could revel in such bliss.\nWhy do you look at me and frown?\n    What have I done but love you well?\n    Does she love me? Come, picture, tell--\nThe moth returns, and flutters down\nUpon that blessed wavy hair.\n    Oh, how I love each scented strand!\n    How oft my lips would make a band\nTo capture in a kiss, ensnare\nA lock of that dear crown of yours!\n    Ah, well, be vexed with me, severe.\n    Those eyes have never shed a tear;\nThey follow me on restless tours,\nWhile I the night pace to and fro,\n    Hour after hour, to pass away\n    The dreary time before the day.\nYour eyes upon these journeys go,\nWatching, sternly. Picture, tell me--\n    What sphinx are you? Speak once and show\n    Some sign of pleasure. Let me know\nIf you would from my company\nBe gone, and choose another one\n    To be with you each day, each hour;\n    Resting only--then in my power--\nWhen from the villages I run?\nThen cosily you rest between\n    The folds of my best coat--from grime\n    And soot set free. At evening time\nAlone I leave you here. How mean\nOf you to be so petulant!\n    Not once of late have you beguiled\n    A moody hour of mine and smiled.\nIf I have sinned, it was not meant.\nCome, now be patient with me, friend.\n    See, I will coax a smile--I\u2019ll set\n    You this way--that way--no smile yet?\nJust for a moment! Please unbend.\nThen I shall turn you now oblique--\n    Ah! what a change! Your eyes are quite\n    Like hers--they hold the heavens so bright--\nThose stars my lonely soul would seek.\nI nearly called you Hebe, then--\n    You were so like, for just a span,\n    As o\u2019er your brow vibrations ran.\nSo they oft do o\u2019er Hebe\u2019s, when\nSome mischief, brewing in her mind,\n    Sends laughter ripples o\u2019er her skin--\n    Her mirth will out when mischief\u2019s in.\nWhere might you her resemblance find?\nHer laughter is a wondrous sound--\n    Sorrow, sadness, find their level.\n    Where do joy and gladness revel?\nAh, where? Where Hebe can be found!\nYou know her not; yet you are she\n    Who made you negative. The match\n    Is sometimes perfect. Did you catch\nHer glance when thoughts perhaps of me--\nAlas! that could not be. She knew\n    Me not when you were fashioned, friend,\n    And never dreamed where you would wend\nMile after mile with me, to rue\nThe day when you were sent to hear\n    A million questions. Pity you?\n    I do! No woman, false or true,\nIs in listening long your peer!\nHeavens! What have you heard me tell?\n    What rapture have you witnessed--oft\n    Despair--at which you ever scoffed?\nThe gamut--all from heaven to hell--\nAll passion\u2019s swift vagaries seen--\n    My longing, pleading, anxious nights,\n    And day\u2019s distracted hours. What fights\nWith self, with selfishness between!\nHave you seen all, heard all, known all?\n    Then you must be the wisest sphinx\n    That wisdom new and ancient links.\nBut you are silent as a wall\nWithout a mark. So should it be.\n    For she must never know what I\n    When all alone go through.\n                      Now lie\nDown flat--there! Let me once more see\nInto your eyes, ere to that shore--\n    Where sleep may be--I go tonight\n    With thoughts of her, my joy\u2019s delight,\nTo lull me gently evermore.\n\n\n\n\nSONG\n\n\nI seek your lips with my fond eyes,\n  My sight is weary, dear;\nMy heart with longing all day cries,\n  For you when you are near.\nWhen you are near and others take\n  Your eyes and lips from me,\nAnd in my soul deep surges make,\n  As tempests in the sea.\n\nI seek your lips and press them not,\n  My own are parched with pain;\nMy aching eyes are dim and hot--\n  My soul hopes on in vain.\nThe day is gone, and you are lost,\n  The night for me is lone--\nAnd through its hours I count the cost\n  Of days without my own.\n\n\n\n\nHELL\n\n\nHell holds no terror I shall ever fear,\nFor earth when you are absent is my hell;\nNor thought of meeting can my torment quell,\nFor loneliness is black, and cold, and drear.\nThis hell is dark! My passion is a flame!\nIts anguish is a never dying fire,\nAnd longing--hope that never dare aspire,\nBut die, in loneliness from whence it came.\n    Heav\u2019n though is kind and lets me sometimes in,\n    Then hell is all forgotten, and its woe\n    Fades like the dew dispersed by summer\u2019s morn,\n    And I am purged of all my pain and sin.\n    Such moments shine like jewels--then I go\n    Back to the dreary hell where pain was born.\n\n\n\n\nALONE\n\n\nThe mocking fiends by day\nMake frenzied play\nAround my loneliness;\nThe haunting sprites delight\nTo sport at night,\nAnd jeer at my soul\u2019s wretchedness;\nImprisoned in the boundary of a mind\nHolding but one thought; only one can find\nThe thought of you!\nYou, far away,\nIn silence wrapped.\nWith all Hell\u2019s crew\nAbout me gay,\nAnd I in loneliness am trapped.\n\nNot God nor Devil ease\nThe torture of a lonely soul,\nFor haunting thoughts will cling,\nAnd naught relief can bring--\nNo recreation please.\nGrim misery must take its toll\nOf tears and pain--\nAnd work is vain!\n\nThe vanquished mind in scorn\nSneers on its child;\nHis work, and damns it be forlorn,\nAnd with it all creative work\nHenceforward be reviled.\nWork? Where? Not here! Within these walls?\nWork! What? Come, try it now,\nAnd answer every thought that calls\nIn every moment. Tell me how\nOne single minute, pray,\nMy mind can get away\nFrom her, the absent one--\nCome, tell me, and my work is done.\n\nThe air! Go out and roam the field.\nSit in the sun--or rain;\nOr count the stars again;\nOr tell the steps long footsore journeys have revealed.\nDo something. Go! But what?\nWhat, leave that thought behind?\nWhere go? Where that is not\nThe burden of my mind?\n\nForget. Why, all the fiends of midnight hours\nYell that drab word at me; it falls in showers\nOf rattling drops,\nAnd never stops,\nUntil my ears\nNigh burst,\nAnd I accurst\nWith all Hell\u2019s fears!\n\nStill there are moments when\nRelief comes to my ken,\nThen I admire my torturer sublime.\nThe silence of her absence is like time\nA million years beyond this day--\nLike stillness of forgotten tombs,\nWhere Nineveh, once gay,\nStood mighty, where now the sandstorm booms\nO\u2019er a desert quite as lonely as my heart.\nShe leaves me, like a queen, to bear the smart\nOf her superb indifference and calm--\nUnconscious of the harm\nSuch loneliness can do!\n\nThe day when it is new\nDawns dark and drear.\nEach hour a bier\nOn which I lay my thought,\nAnd see it come to life again--\nReincarnated spirit, caught\nBack, to murder it in agony, and then--\nThe weary strife goes on and on,\nThe minutes reek with blood,\nAnd then the fiends of loneliness soon don\nThe inky cloak with scarlet hood,\nAnd round me chant their racking dirges chill,\nAnd bring their terrors on to slay my will.\n\nFirst, slimy, drooling Jealousy appears--\nA female draped in timid lover\u2019s fears--\nShe minces, ambles, leers at me,\nAnd whispers tales, maliciously.\nThe spume of Hell\u2019s presumption she,\nThe horror of the lonely. See!\nHow she begins her work--\nThe craft! the skill!\nIt enters like a dirk--\nThe soul to kill.\n\nShe fails, and vanishes in mist.\nMy soul is adamant, and will resist.\nThen Poison comes, in silvery sheen,\nThe figure holds a cup between\nThe palms of outstretched hands,\nAnd in a pleasant tone commands me, \u201cDrink!\nAnd no more think.\nWhy suffer earth\u2019s delirious pain?\nThe yearning heart that yearns in vain\nWill know no peace until the light\nGoes out in never-ending night.\nI bring you here the only balm\nFor loneliness. Drink, and be calm!\nWhere all is still no aching mind\nCan harrow you--peace you will find.\u201d\nThen Poison hies away;\nTo tempt me when despair\nMay crush me some dread day,\nAnd I no longer care!\n\nThey fail to find me apt,\nSo on comes License garbed\nIn golden lace, and wrapped\nAbout her waist a serpent barbed.\nHell\u2019s finest figure walks\nWith dignity and grace;\nBeseechingly she talks,\nAnd modest is her face.\nThe fiends do well. They know\nThe jade\nMust masquerade,\nSeem innocence, aglow,\nMy loneliness to break and then beguile!\nThe trick is hardly worth a smile.\nStill I am left alone\nTo wrestle with the spawn\nThat comes from Hell to fawn\nOn me. Can soul atone\nFor this one cruel act of thine,\nMy torturer, divine?\nCan thoughts so merciless afflict\nThe mind and leave it sane?\nOr bubbles burst, when they are pricked,\nAnd seem the same again?\nThe weariness of longing and its woe,\nThe evil thoughts drear loneliness will sow,\nThe torrid tears,\nAbhorrent fears,\nThe fretful waiting,\nThe frenzied hating;\nAll come to me, by night, by day,\nWhen you are far away.\n\n *       *       *       *\n\nTired mind is easy prey\nFor hideous imagination\u2019s play.\n\n\n\n\nROAMING\n\n\nIs there no place where I might rest?\n  No harbour for my soul?\nMust I go roaming on unblest,\n  Without a chart or goal?\n\nGo searching for a place where peace\n  May soothe away my pain;\nSome lonely nook where ills may cease,\n  And nothing be all gain?\n\nAnd yet, with all the pain and tears,\n  That lonely sorrows bring;\nThough life\u2019s besetting woes are fears,\n  To hope\u2019s frail staff I cling.\n\nMy fears are hopes in joy\u2019s disguise,\n  My hopes are fears in flight,\nWhich seek an earthly paradise,\n  Beyond the range of sight.\n\nSo nestle, pain, you constant friend,\n  Close to my longing heart--\nWhat matter how the story end--\n  We two shall never part.\n\nAnd yet there is a place I know,\n  Where all griefs are forgot--\nA breast to which I ever go,\n  E\u2019en knowing it is not.\n\nI go to that dear place to lose\n  All fears, all woes, all pains;\nIt is the paradise I choose,\n  Where life eternal reigns!\n\nWhere life is drawn anew from springs,\n  Which flow with every bliss,\nAnd to me joy celestial brings\n  New hope with every kiss!\n\nAlas, the breast of love is wide,\n  Too precious for one life,\nAnd others cannot be denied--\n  For what is love but strife?\n\nSo, ever seeking, trudge and roam,\n  Through hours of chill and gloom,\nAnd make the silent night your home,\n  Where there is always room.\n\nRoam on, until a morn shall rise,\n  When you will wake from rest,\nAnd know you have found paradise,\n  At last, upon her breast.\n\n\n\n\nSTORM\n\n\nGrief is a drenching blast that purges love\nOf all its dross and scum, and leaves it sweet\nAnd holy in its excellence complete.\nLove without grief no test of strength will prove.\nThe bitterness and pain, dread loneliness,\nThe ache of yearning, then the galling thought--\nLove\u2019s deep passions in shattering gusts are caught,\nAnd scattered wide apart when deep distress\nComes raging through the soul\u2019s wide-open door;\nShaking the citadel of hope--the walls\nWhere all the dearest joys take refuge in--\nSearching the battered frame to find its core,\nWith that convulsive fury which appalls\nThe strongest heart that deepest Love would win.\n\n\n\n\nTHE VOID\n\n\nThe grey day dawns and sleep is gone,\n  The laggard hours are here to count--\nLike yesterday\u2019s the sun shone on--\n  A dreary stream from time\u2019s old fount.\n\nGo, day, as fast as my heart beats,\n  Pass, minutes, with the speed of thought--\nFly, as my soul, when it entreats\n  Swift passage where its love is sought.\n\nThe present bridge with then and when,\n  Link past and future, dropping now;\nDie, days, and rot like aged men,\n  Nights, vanish like a gamester\u2019s vow!\n\nHope, on in front, seeks out the way,\n  Doubt stays behind and scoffs at all,\nTrust walks with calm all through the day,\n  Faith brightly shines through night\u2019s deep pall.\n\nLife in the ever present hour,\n  Art in the prison of life\u2019s pain,\nLove in the torture of its power;\n  Death shares with sleep what joy should gain.\n\n\n\n\nABSENCE\n\n\nThere is no anguish like the mourning heart,\nThat mourns for its lost love and mourns in vain;\nThat is the anguish which defies all pain--\nTorture at which Prometheus\u2019 soul would start!\n\nWhat agony can still the heart of joy,\nThat holds its loved one to its surging breast?\nAll hell can rage and not disturb that rest--\nThen Stygian tortures are but pain\u2019s alloy!\n\n    And what is absence but a gaping sore,\n    That aches and suffers every stinging thrust?\n    A burning lesion, or a bleeding rent,\n    That rives the soul of lovers to the core?\n    When hearts in absence stronger grow, then must\n    Those hearts have held no lover\u2019s aliment!\n\n\n\n\nWANDERING\n\n\nThe morning hath the sun for mate,\n  The night the moon for wife;\nThe wind and I, like things of hate,\n  Go on alone through life.\n\nThe wind is cold, the wind is hot,\n  The wind is fierce and wild;\nIt stays not long in any spot,\n  It never is beguiled.\n\nPerhaps the wind might pause awhile\n  And whisper to the reeds,\nIf they would only rise and smile,\n  And ask the lone wind\u2019s needs.\n\n\n\n\nDESTINY\n\n\nHere, let it be! I will not ask,\nDear God, what is my destiny.\nWith courage I will face the task--\nSo, life, make what you will of me.\n\nYet I would know what is this pain,\nWhich smites with cruel force my mind?\nAnd what can sorrow hope to gain\nIf woe is all my heart can find?\n\nWhy linger here? There must be rest\nIn some fair haven Thou hast made,\nOr is the region of the blest\nAs vain a place as this? Then fade\n\nSweet hope! And let the clouds of night\nAssemble o\u2019er my weary head--\nWhy question more about the fight\nOf souls that battle with the dead?\n\nStill destiny may be some song\nMy aching heart might learn to sing,\nA melody, both sweet and long,\nAnd singing, heaven nearer bring!\n\nPerhaps my doubts are shadows chill;\nMy mind may harbour questions vain.\nMy destiny! the merest rill\nOn ocean\u2019s wide, unresting main.\n\nThen Life and Death may count as past--\nThings gone beneath the sodden clay.\nFor some great part, Thou, me might cast,\nTo light dejection\u2019s gloomy day.\n\nYes, there is Love! Love ever bright,\nLove worshipping the soul of her\nWho came from thee--with morn\u2019s first light--\nEmbodiment of all things fair.\n\nThis let me do. Take Death! Take Life!\nAnd leave me Love\u2019s celestial glow.\nAnd save me from the toil and strife,\nWhich loveless souls are doomed to know.\n\n\n\n\nEAST WIND\n\n\nSpeak, east wind, did you meet my love\n  When you came o\u2019er the sea?\nAnd did she give a message kind\n  For you to bring to me?\n\nWhen you were passing through the haunts\n  Of happy, garish men,\nDid you once linger in her hair,\n  And murmur to her then\n\nA word, reminding her of one\n  Far out on western plains,\nWho looks, and waits, from morn \u2019til night,\n  With hope that never wanes?\n\nWith hope that she will send some word--\n  One moment of her mind--\nTo prove that when we meet again\n  My true love I shall find?\n\nNo message, east wind, do you bring,\n  You leave me lone and cold,\nFarewell, thou heartless wanderer,\n  Go, chilling young and old!\n\nGo journeys long in search of hills\n  Where only echoes dwell,\nWild east wind, scorn the love-lorn ones,\n  Who would their sad tales tell.\n\n\n\n\nLULLABY\n\n\nWhere is peace but on your breast?\nWhere does slumbering joy lie down?\nWhere do hope and gladness rest,\nLike bright jewels in a crown?\n\nAll are found where your heart beats;\nLike strong children in repose,\nWhen the twilight hour retreats,\nAnd day\u2019s golden moments close!\n\nLull me, dearest, into sleep,\nLet me find a pillow fair\nOn your breast, where breathings deep\nRock me, far away from care.\n\nKiss my aching brow, and then--\nLay your hands upon my head;\nPeace will come to me again,\nWhen your bosom is my bed.\n\n\n\n\nRESURRECTION\n\n\nWhen all my friends say \u201cHe is gone,\u201d\n  And foes agree to let me rest,\nWhen ling\u2019ring night falls down upon\n  The heart that ached, the restless breast.\n\nThere is a way to conquer death,\n  To rob the grey shade of its spoil,\nE\u2019en when is spent my last deep breath\n  And naught is left of love and toil.\n\nThen come, dear love, and look on me;\n  Pour your bright spirit in your glance;\nMy soul suffuse with joy of thee,\n  Straight from your eyes which do enhance\n\nThe light of heaven! One look will raise\n  Me from my bier, and make me whole,\nRestoring youth and gladsome days--\n  Elixir of my yearning soul!\n\n\n\n\nLAUGHTER\n\n\nDear love, when droop my weary eyes,\nAnd patient Death comes near and cries:\n\u201cTired soul, come forth, and follow me.\u201d\nI ask that thou, my love, shall be\nWrapped close to my desiring breast,\nSo at the last I shall be blest\nWith transports of thy laughter. Laugh\nIn my arms ecstatic glee,\nAnd cheer my soul, and I shall quaff\nThy fragrant breath and smile at thee.\nDear heart of joy, let my last hour\nKnow all thy wondrous merry power--\nRich in the graces of thy charms,\nLaugh on through each entrancing kiss;\nWhen I am locked in thy dear arms\nLaugh me away to Death in bliss.\n\n\n\n\nALCHEMY\n\n\nI was ill, and with a touch\nShe reclaimed my waning strength.\nBless her, God, and give her much\nJoy in love, and days of length.\nWhat is tragic\nPain to me?\nSuch her magic--\nAlchemy.\nShe smiled on me\nWhen I was ill\nAnd, lo!\nFrom pain set free\nI go\nAnd drink my fill\nAt her beauty\u2019s fountain flowing!\nOh, the bliss of breathing\nFragrance from her graces blowing;\nGrace like colour seething,\nFrom a thousand flowers,\nScenting June\u2019s rich bowers.\nI am well, and she has made\nEvery sorrow\nBring a morrow\nHappier than today.\nEvery sadness is repaid\nWith rejoicing;\nLike a voicing\nWoodland in the month of May.\nMerry is her soul,\nAnd witty, too, her nimble mind--\nLike a golden bowl\nOf medicines of every kind.\nLaughter lurks in all her dimples,\nLoving hands of hers give simples--\nSoothing, cheering, happy one--\nTreasure of the golden sun!\n\n\n\n\nSURRENDER\n\n\nTake every joy my nature holds,\nTake every bliss my heart enfolds;\nCome, capture every one,\nWhile youth and beauty run,\nLocked in each other\u2019s lithesome arms--\nLike flowers entwined.\nCast from thy mind\nThose fearful, hindering alarms.\nTake, to the last deep drop,\nNor think when you would stop,\nMy strength\u2019s rich wine.\nLove made divine\nThe rapturous blood of me for you.\nRed, full and bright,\nLike Vallambrosa\u2019s vineyard dew\nOn autumn\u2019s night.\nMy mind explore, its treasures take,\nSo long as joy is there\nTo find, and leave it bare\nOf every thought that might awake\nNew transports in your soul--\nThen break the empty bowl,\nSo no one else may use\nThe vessel, should one choose.\nMy body clean and sweet enjoy,\n\u2019Twas made to serve your least delight,\nAnd when at last our passions cloy,\nIn one fierce moment, rise and smite\nWith withering scorn,\nAnd leave it shorn\nOf all its energy and force.\nThen, blasted, reel it down death\u2019s course.\nMy soul? Nay, that, my love, you cannot hurt,\nFor it is thee. Look, and it will assert\nYour image like a faithful stream,\nReflecting every feature of your form,\nShowing the slightest, quickest gleam\nFrom eyes which make it pass from cold to warm.\nIt is, O love, your heart, your pulse, your breath,\nAnd only in your loss can it know death!\nHere I surrender all my mind,\nMy heart, my body, all you find\nIn thought, in blood, in flesh, to serve thee well\nIn giving heaven--then, thou, consign to hell\nWhate\u2019er is left of me.\nE\u2019en then my joy shall be--\nThat it was wrecked by thee.\n\n\n\n\nWHAT IS DAY WITHOUT THE SUN?\n\n\nWhat is day without the sun?\n  The night without the stars?\nOcean\u2019s music would not run,\n  Without the sandy bars!\n\nSummer days without a rose--\n  A fruitless Autumn would\nMake the year a time of woes--\n  Like Spring without a bud.\n\nWhat am I without my mate?\n  Without her bonny face?\nA wanderer disconsolate--\n  A being out of place.\n\nShe is sun and stars to me--\n  The Spring, and Summer too;\nAutumn\u2019s fruit her love will be,\n  To sweeten all I do!\n\n\n\n\nTHE MORN\n\n\nShe cometh like the sweet reprieving morn,\nClad in her flowing robes of golden light;\nGod\u2019s angel of the day to clear the sight\nOf him condemned long years, and left forlorn,\nDeep in the dungeon of his loveless life,\nWith every yearning for a love supreme--\nLove shining only in a cruel dream!\nAnd now his love appears to end the strife.\n\n    Oh, love, thou gentle messenger, bend down,\n    Thy touch is soothing and thy smile is kind;\n    Speak to this sorrowing heart and bid its fears\n    Be gone forevermore. When as thy crown\n    Appears at dawn, and night flies on the wind,\n    So banish all my sorrows and their tears.\n\n\n\n\nTHE GARDEN MADE FOR ME\n\n\nMy love and I a garden made--\n    So early in the spring,\n    When larks begin to sing--\nFrail violets a carpet laid,\nOf tender blues, for my sweet maid,\n    When we were gardening.\n\nI did not see the garden grow--\n    Fate turned me far astray,\n    Ere summer\u2019s happy ray\nThe garden kissed, and all the glow\nOf fragrant hours I did not know--\n    My summer\u2019s days were grey.\n\nI did not pick sweet blooms for her,\n    To make a crown to grace\n    Her head, and bonny face;\nI wandered in a world so bare,\nNo flower of love perfumed the air,\n    No blossoms could I trace.\n\nSome lovers sow, some lovers reap,\n    And others never see\n    The gardens that might be;\nStill, though I might not reap, I keep,\nIn dreams of her, the mem\u2019ry deep\n    Of gardens made for me.\n\n\n\n\nTO A REPEATER\n\n\nTell me truly, quaint repeater,\nWhen will she permit me greet her?\nTell me when you sweetly chime--\nName the day, and strike the time.\n\nOn my heart you beat so gaily,\nWhere her heart has beaten daily;\nShe should think of us at night,\nWhen we two count hours in flight.\n\nQuaint repeater, friend diurnal\n(Like a truthful, faithful journal),\nMake the minutes pass away,\nSpeed the night, and hasten day.\n\nDo you keep the hours correctly?\nHands that move so circumspectly\nOught, punctiliously, to show\nWhen a lad to lass should go.\n\nQuaint repeater, faster, faster,\nIf you would avert disaster;\nMake the long days swiftly fly,\nGreeting hour is surely nigh.\n\nHow can I exist in anguish,\nWhen for her I fret and languish?\nQuaint repeater, may I rest,\nWhere you lay, upon her breast!\n\n\n\n\nTHE MUSIC OF A DREAM\n\n\nA song lies buried in my soul,\nIts melody is silent there,\nThe glory of it I would roll\nIn ecstasy, if thou would\u2019st care\nTo hear its sweet enchanting strain,\nIn some deep garden where the hills\nWould echo its subdued refrain,\nWhere fragrance every cloister fills,\nWhere flowery carpets spread, for thee,\nOf velvet petals of the rose,\nIs where the song will flow from me\nInto the heart thy lover knows.\nMy precious love, my one delight,\nThou art more fair than that first dawn\nWhich made the new-born world so bright;\nWhen primal dews spread o\u2019er the lawn\nAnd grass held jewels in its sheath,\nWhere earth\u2019s first flowers were kissed by day.\nMore fair, art thou, than Ceres\u2019 wreath\nFor tender maidens crowned with May.\nA song for thee, and thee alone,\nNo other ear shall know its theme;\nMy eastern pearl of rarest tone,\nIt is the music of a dream;\nA dream of gushing, surging love\nFrom never-saving, endless springs,\nDown deep, as heaven is high above;\nIts course, as wide as Cosmos flings\nThe starry gems which light the skies,\nWhen nightingales pour out their song;\nAs soft as joy in lover\u2019s eyes,\nIn climes, where nights of love are long.\n\n\n\n\nA FLOWER\n\n\nIn all this world you are to me\n  A flower, serene, alone;\nA sight kind heaven lets me see\nWhen I am deep in misery,\n  And hope of joy near flown.\n\nYou, like a bloom when woods are grey,\n  Arresting soul and mind,\nWith beauty bidding me to stay,\nAnd worship you with prayer and lay,\n  And ease for sorrow find.\n\nOh, flower of perfect loveliness,\n  Oh, bloom of spring\u2019s fair day,\nWhat gentle joys do you impress\nUpon my soul, with happiness\n  Which sweeps the clouds away!\n\n\n\n\nWHAT WOULD YOU DO?\n\n\n    What would you do?\n    If you loved me,\n    As I love you.\nIf you in absence sad,\nLonged for a moment\u2019s joy--\nMy voice to make you glad--\nWould you the time employ\nIn going to your lad?\n    And whisper: \u201cMine alone,\n    Yes, I am thine, my own;\nIn all this busy world--we two--\nYou live for me, and I for you.\u201d\n\n    What would you do?\n    If you loved me,\n    As I love you.\n    If you were far away,\nAnd hungered for a word,\nJust one--to brighten day;\nSome message for a bird\nTo carry, would you say?\n    \u201cMy lover, mine alone,\n    Yes, I am thine, my own;\nIn all this busy world--just two--\nYou live for me, and I for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHER SOUL\u2019S SWEET HEART\n\n\nIt is the heart within the soul of her\nThat shines, and sets her lily face aglow.\nTurning to rosy blush the velvet snow,\nTo make the pearly morn look far less fair!\nIt is her soul\u2019s sweet heart that makes her eyes\nThe envied of the stars, when glances bright\nMount up and gleam from her kind orbs at night,\nAnd spread celestial fire across the skies!\n\n    No heart of flesh and blood could glorify\n    A form divine, and make so sweet a face\n    As that which smiles in pity from above--\n    Her spirit \u2019tis, which beats mysteriously,\n    And gives her every action heaven\u2019s grace,\n    And wins my human heart to God-like love!\n\n\n\n\nI LOVE YOU SO!\n\n\n    I love you so!\nWhat sacrifice is meet\nThat I should make, my sweet,\n    That I might show\nMy love in some rich way,\nTo brighten all your day?\n    To keep from strife\nOur years of love, dear wife?\n\n    I love you so!\nMy life is naught to me--\nOf use to none but thee--\n    Oh, that you know!\nYet would its end once bring\nYou joy, how could I cling\n    To it, and bear\nThe thought it brought you care?\n\n    I love you so!\nThere is no death I fear\nTo save you pain, my dear.\n    For death I owe\nTo love, for your sweet grace!\nLoved vision of your face\n    Rest in my eyes,\nWhen death takes my last sighs.\n\n    I love you so!\nMy own, my precious mate,\nI fear not any fate--\n    No pain, no woe--\nSo long as I may die\nBeneath the smiling sky.\n    Your eyes for me\nMake heaven\u2019s canopy!\n\n\n\n\nLOVE\u2019S LAST QUEST\n\n\nShe came to me, a messenger of spring,\nBorne on the wings of ecstasy, and joy\nFlowed o\u2019er me like a sunburst\u2019s splendid ray.\nMy silent soul was moved again to sing,\nMy saddened mind was purged of its alloy--\nShe led me up from cheerless night to day.\n\nShe came, a vision of delights I dreamed\nWhen all the world of wonder moved my heart;\nShe brought fair prospects to my fading sight,\nAnd proved that life was dearer than it seemed;\nShe led me back to rosy realms of art--\nShe, sweet embodiment of art\u2019s delight!\n\nShe came, and changed the purpose of the years;\nWith grace she gave long days of peace to me.\nHer gift--the jewel of her love she gave,\nA glory and a passion without peers;\nAs full of splendour as the orient sea,\nWhere pearls of heaven rest beneath the wave.\n\nShe came, and shed her gentle loveliness\nUpon me, trembling \u2019neath her spell sublime,\nAnd chose me for her loving mate; to know\nHer worth, and find in her love\u2019s happiness;\nShe came, and made a wondrous dream divine,\nHer beauty and her rapture all aglow.\n\nBlest vision of the dream youth sought in vain;\nSweet chalice, where commingled rest all aims;\nEnchanting mystery of love\u2019s last quest,\nWhat can I offer thee that thou would\u2019st deign\nCommensurate (all that the world acclaims\nMost precious things) with those rich gifts--the best--\n\nThe rarest love, thou didst bestow on me?\nThere\u2019s naught in all the stores of earth to find\nTo give in just return--no star above!\nSave what thou\u2019st made--my own deep love for thee--\nA heart and soul renewed, a richer mind--\nMy life\u2019s devotion and a deathless love!\n\n\n\n\nCONSECRATION\n\n\nWhat shall I do for thee, my love?\n  What glory can I win?\nWhat aim is there too high for me?\n  What strife to conquer in?\nTo thee, my love, whate\u2019er befall,\nI give my life, my soul, my all.\n\nNo joy, no pleasure shall I seek,\n  In which you have no share;\nAll pain and sorrow I shall keep\n  From you, and I shall care\nFor every hour in which you live,\nAs \u2019twere the last that God would give.\n\nYour worshiper receive with joy.\n  My happy lips now seal,\nSo all my thought and words may be\n  For thee. Then I shall kneel,\nAnd vow \u2019fore heaven my love is true,\nAnd consecrate its life to you.\n\n\nTHE END",
