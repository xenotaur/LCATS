Milton is as far away from us in time as Dante\nwas from him; destructive criticism has been busy with his great poem;\nformidable rivals of his fame have arisen--Dryden and Pope, Wordsworth\nand Byron, Tennyson and Browning, not to speak of lesser names--poets\nwhom we read perhaps oftener and with more pleasure.  Yet still his\nthrone remains unshaken.  By general--by well-nigh universal--consent,\nhe is still the second poet of our race, the greatest, save one, of all\nwho have used the English speech.\n\nThe high epics, the Iliad, the Divine Comedy, do not appear to us as\nthey appeared to their contemporaries, nor as they appeared to the\nMiddle Ages or to the men of the Renaissance or of the eighteenth\ncentury.  These peaks of song we see foreshortened or in changed\nperspective or from a different angle of observation.  Their parallax\nvaries from age to age, yet their stature does not dwindle; they tower\nforever, \"like Teneriffe or Atlas unremoved.\"  _Paradise Lost_ does not\nmean the same thing to us that it meant to Addison or Johnson or\nMacaulay, and much that those critics said of it now seems mistaken.\nWorks of art, as of nature, have perishable elements, and suffer a loss\nfrom time's transhifting.  Homer's gods are childish, Dante's hell\ngrotesque; and the mythology of the one and the scholasticism of the\nother are scarcely more obsolete to-day than Milton's theology.  Yet in\nthe dryest parts of _Paradise Lost_ we feel the touch of the master.\nTwo things in particular, the rhythm and the style, go on victoriously\nas by their own momentum.  God the Father may be a school divine and\nAdam a member of Parliament, but the verse never flags, the diction\nnever fails.  The poem may grow heavy, but not languid, thin or weak.\nI confess that there are traits of Milton which repel or irritate; that\nthere are poets with whom sympathy is easier.  And if I were speaking\nmerely as an impressionist, I might prefer them to him.  But this does\nnot affect my estimate of his absolute greatness.\n\nAll poets, then, and lovers of poetry, all literary critics and\nstudents of language must honor in Milton the almost faultless artist,\nthe supreme master of his craft.  But there is a reason why, not alone\nthe literary class, but all men of English stock should celebrate\nMilton's tercentenary.  There have been poets whose technique was\nexquisite, but whose character was contemptible.  John Milton was not\nsimply a great poet, but a great man, a heroic soul; and his type was\ncharacteristically English, both in its virtues and its shortcomings.\nOf Shakspere, the man, we know next to nothing.  But of Milton\npersonally we know all that we need to know, more than is known of many\na modern author.  There is abundance of biography and autobiography.\nMilton had a noble self-esteem, and he was engaged for twenty years in\nhot controversies.  Hence those passages of apologetics scattered\nthrough his prose works, from which the lives of their author have been\nlargely compiled.  Moreover he was a pamphleteer and journalist, as\nwell as a poet, uttering himself freely on the questions of the day.\nWe know his opinions on government, education, religion, marriage and\ndivorce, the freedom of the press and many other subjects.  We know\nwhat he thought of eminent contemporaries, Charles I., Cromwell, Vane,\nDesborough, Overton, Fairfax.  It was not then the fashion to write\ncritical essays, literary reviews and book notices.  Yet, aside from\nhis own practice, his writings are sown here and there with incidental\njudgments of books and authors, from which his literary principles may\nbe gathered.  He has spoken now and again of Shakspere and Ben Jonson,\nof Spenser, Chaucer, Euripides, Homer, the book of Job, the psalms of\nDavid, the Song of Solomon, the poems of Tasso and Ariosto, the Arthur\nand Charlemagne romances, of Bacon and Selden, the dramatic unities,\nblank verse _vs._ rhyme, and similar topics.\n\nIn some aspects and relations, harsh and unlovely, egotistical and\nstubborn, the total impression of Milton's personality is singularly\nimposing.  His virtues were manly virtues.  Of the four cardinal moral\nvirtues--the so-called Aristotelian virtues--temperance, justice,\nfortitude, prudence; which Dante symbolizes by the group of stars--\n\n  Non viste mai fuor ch' alla prima gente--\n\nMilton had a full share.  He was not always, though he was most\ncommonly, just.  Prudence, the only virtue, says Carlyle, which gets\nits reward on earth, prudence he had, yet not a timid prudence.  Of\ntemperance--the Puritan virtue--and all that it includes, chastity,\nself-reverence, self-control, _Comus_ is the beautiful hymn.  But,\nabove all, Milton had the heroic virtue, fortitude; not only passively\nin the proud and sublime endurance of the evil days and evil tongues on\nwhich he had fallen; of the darkness, dangers, solitude that compassed\nhim round; but actively in \"the unconquerable will * * * and courage\nnever to submit or yield\"; the courage which \"bates no jot of heart or\nhope, but still bears up and steers right onward.\"\n\nThere is nothing more bracing in English poetry than those passages in\nthe sonnets, in _Paradise Lost_ and in _Samson Agonistes_ where Milton\nspeaks of his blindness.  Yet here it is observable that Milton, who is\nnever sentimental, is also never pathetic but when he speaks of\nhimself, in such lines, e.g., as Samson's\n\n  My race of glory run, and race of shame,\n  And I shall shortly be with them that rest.\"\n\nDante has this same touching dignity in alluding to his own sorrows;\nbut his hard and rare pity is more often aroused by the sorrows of\nothers: by Ugolino's little starving children, or by the doom of\nFrancesca and her lover.  Milton is untender.  Yet virtue with him is\nnot always forbidding and austere.  As he was a poet, he felt the\n\"beauty of holiness,\" though in another sense than Archbishop Laud's\nuse of that famous phrase.  It was his \"natural haughtiness,\" he tells\nus, that saved him from sensuality and base descents of mind.  His\nvirtue was a kind of good taste, a delicacy almost womanly.  It is the\n\"Lady of Christ's\" speaking with the lips of the lady in _Comus_, who\nsays\n\n  --That which is not good is not delicious\n  To a well governed and wise appetite.\"\n\n\nBut there is a special fitness in this commemoration at this place.\nFor Milton is the scholar poet.  He is the most learned, the most\nclassical, the most bookish--I was about to say the most academic--of\nEnglish poets; but I remember that academic, through its use in certain\nconnections, might imply a timid conformity to rules and models, a lack\nof vital originality which would not be true of Milton.  Still, Milton\nwas an academic man in a broad sense of the word.  A hard student of\nbooks, he injured his eyes in boyhood by too close application, working\nevery day till midnight.  He spent seven years at his university.  He\nwas a teacher and a writer on education.  I need not give the catalog\nof his acquirements further than to say that he was the best educated\nEnglishman of his generation.\n\nMark Pattison, indeed, who speaks for Oxford, denies that Milton was a\nregularly learned man, like Usher or Selden.  That is, I understand, he\nhad made no exhaustive studies in professional fields of knowledge such\nas patristic theology or legal antiquities.  Of course not: Milton was\na poet: he was studying for power, for self-culture and inspiration,\nand had little regard for a merely retrospective scholarship which\nwould not aid him in the work of creation.\n\nBe that as it may, all Milton's writings in prose and verse are so\nsaturated with learning as greatly to limit the range of their appeal.\nA poem like _Lycidas_, loaded with allusions, can be fully enjoyed only\nby the classical scholar who is in the tradition of the Greek\npastoralists, who \"knows the Dorian water's gush divine.\"  I have heard\nwomen and young people and unlettered readers who have a natural taste\nfor poetry, and enjoy Burns and Longfellow, object to this classical\nstiffness in Milton as pedantry.  Now pedantry is an ostentation of\nlearning for its own sake, and none has said harder things of it than\nMilton.\n\n              \"--Who reads\n  Incessantly, and to his reading brings not\n  A spirit and judgment equal or superior * *\n  Uncertain and unsettled still remains,\n  Deep-versed in books and shallow in himself.\"\n\n\nCowley was the true pedant: his erudition was crabbed and encumbered\nthe free movement of his mind, while Milton made his the grace and\nornament of his verse.\n\n  How charming is divine philosophy!\n  Not harsh and crabbed, as dull fools suppose,\n  But musical as is Apollo's lute.\"\n\nI think we may attribute Milton's apparent pedantry, not to a wish for\ndisplay, but to an imagination familiarized with a somewhat special\nrange of associations.  This is a note of the Renaissance, and Milton's\nculture was Renaissance culture.  That his mind derived its impetus\nmore directly from books than from life; that his pages swarm with the\nfigures of mythology and the imagery of the ancient poets is true.  In\nhis youthful poems he accepted and perfected Elizabethan, that is,\nRenaissance, forms: the court masque, the Italian sonnet, the\nartificial pastoral.  But as he advanced in art and life, he became\nclassical in a severer sense, discarding the Italianate conceits of his\nearly verse, rejecting rhyme and romance, replacing decoration with\nconstruction; and finally, in his epic and tragedy modeled on the pure\nantique, applying Hellenic form to Hebraic material.  His political and\nsocial, no less than his literary, ideals were classical.  The English\nchurch ritual, with its Catholic ceremonies; the universities, with\ntheir scholastic curricula; the feudal monarchy, the medieval court and\npeerage--of all these barbarous survivals of the Middle Ages he would\nhave made a clean sweep, to set up in their stead a commonwealth\nmodeled on the democracies of Greece and Rome, schools of philosophy\nlike the Academy and the Porch, and voluntary congregations of\nProtestant worshipers without priest, liturgy or symbol, practicing a\npurely rational and spiritual religion.  He says to the Parliament:\n\"How much better I find ye esteem it to imitate the old and elegant\nhumanity of Greece than the barbaric pride of a Hunnish and Norwegian\nstateliness.\"  And elsewhere: \"Those ages to whose polite wisdom and\nletters we owe that we are not yet Goths and Jutlanders.\"\n\nSo in his treatment of public questions Milton had what Bacon calls\n\"the humor of a scholar.\"  He was an idealist and a doctrinaire, with\nlittle historic sense and small notion of what is practicable here and\nnow.  England is still a monarchy; the English church is still\nprelatical and has its hireling clergy; Parliament keeps its two\nchambers, and the bishops sit and vote in the house of peers; ritualism\nand tractarianism gain apace upon low church and evangelical; the\n_Areopagitica_ had no effect whatever in hastening the freedom of the\npress; and, ironically enough, Milton himself, under the protectorate,\nbecame an official book licenser.\n\nEngland was not ripe for a republic; she was returning to her idols,\n\"choosing herself a captain back to Egypt.\"  It took a century and a\nhalf for English liberty to recover the ground lost at the Restoration.\nNevertheless that little group of republican idealists, Vane, Bradshaw,\nLambert and the rest, with Milton their literary spokesman, must always\ninterest us as Americans and republicans.  Let us, however, not\nmistake.  Milton was no democrat.  His political principles were\nrepublican, or democratic if you please, but his personal feelings were\nintensely aristocratic.  Even that free commonwealth which he thought\nhe saw so easy and ready a way to establish, and the constitution of\nwhich he sketched on the eve of the Restoration, was no democracy, but\nan aristocratic, senatorial republic like Venice, a government of the\n_optimates_, not of the populace.  For the trappings of royalty, the\npomp and pageantry, the servility and flunkeyism of a court, Milton had\nthe contempt of a plain republican:\n\n      \"How poor their outworn coronets\n  Beside one leaf of that plain civic wreath!\"\n\nBut for the people, as a whole, he had an almost equal contempt.  They\nwere \"the ungrateful multitude,\" \"the inconsiderate multitude,\" the\n_profanum vulgus_, \"the throng and noises of vulgar and irrational\nmen.\"  There was not a popular drop of blood in him.  He had no faith\nin universal suffrage or majority rule.  \"More just it is,\" he wrote,\n\"that a less number compel a greater to retain their liberty, than that\na greater number compel a less to be their fellow slaves,\" i.e. to\nbring back the king by a _plebescite_.  And again: \"The best affected\nand best principled of the people stood not numbering or computing on\nwhich side were most voices in Parliament, but on which side appeared\nto them most reason.\"\n\nMilton was a Puritan; and the Puritans, though socially belonging, for\nthe most part, among the plain people, and though made by accident the\nchampions of popular rights against privilege, were yet a kind of\nspiritual aristocrats.  Calvinistic doctrine made of the elect a chosen\nfew, a congregation of saints, set apart from the world.  To this\nfeeling of religious exclusiveness Milton's pride of intellect added a\npersonal intensity.  He respects distinction and is always rather\nscornful of the average man, the _pecus ignavum silentum_, the herd of\nthe obscure and unfamed.\n\n  \"Nor do I name of men the common rout\n  That, wandering loose about,\n  Grow up and perish like the summer fly,\n  Heads without names, no more remembered.\"\n\n\nHazlitt insisted that Shakspere's principles were aristocratic,\nchiefly, I believe, because of his handling of the tribunes and the\nplebs in _Coriolanus_.  Shakspere does treat his mobs with a kindly and\namused contempt.  They are fickle, ignorant, illogical, thick-headed,\neasily imposed upon.  Still he makes you feel that they are composed of\ngood fellows at bottom, quickly placated and disposed to do the fair\nthing.  I think that Shakspere's is the more democratic nature; that\nhis distrust of the people is much less radical than Milton's.  Walt\nWhitman's obstreperous democracy, his all-embracing _camaraderie_, his\nliking for the warm, gregarious pressure of the crowd, was a spirit\nquite alien from his whose \"soul was like a star and dwelt apart.\"\nAnything vulgar was outside or below the sympathies of this Puritan\ngentleman.  Falstaff must have been merely disgusting to him; and fancy\nhim reading Mark Twain!  In Milton's references to popular pastimes\nthere is always a mixture of disapproval, the air of the superior\nperson.  \"The people on their holidays,\" says Samson, are \"impetuous,\ninsolent, unquenchable.\"  \"Methought,\" says the lady in _Comus_,\n\n            \"--it was the sound\n  Of riot and ill managed merriment,\n  Such as the jocund flute or gamesome pipe\n  Stirs up among the loose, unlettered hinds\n  When, for their teeming flocks and granges full,\n  In wanton dance they praise the bounteous Pan\n  And thank the gods amiss.\"\n\n\nMilton liked to be in the minority, to bear up against the pressure of\nhostile opinion.  \"God intended to prove me,\" he wrote, \"whether I\ndurst take up alone a rightful cause against a world of disesteem, and\nfound I durst.\"  The seraph Abdiel is a piece of self-portraiture;\nthere is no more characteristic passage in all his works:\n\n      \"--The Seraph Abdiel, faithful found\n  Among the faithless, faithful only he * * *\n  Nor number nor example with him wrought\n  To swerve from truth or change his constant mind,\n  Though single.  From amidst them forth he past\n  Long way through hostile scorn which he sustained\n  Superior, nor of violence feared aught;\n  And with retorted scorn his back he turned\n  On those proud towers to swift destruction doomed.\"\n\n\nMilton was no democrat; equality and fraternity were not his trade,\nthough liberty was his passion.  Liberty he defended against the\ntyranny of the mob, as of the king.  He preferred a republic to a\nmonarchy, since he thought it less likely to interfere with the\nindependence of the private citizen.  Political liberty, liberty of\nworship and belief, freedom of the press, freedom of divorce, he\nasserted them all in turn with unsurpassed eloquence.  He proposed a\nscheme of education reformed from the clogs of precedent and authority.\nEven his choice of blank verse for _Paradise Lost_ he vindicated as a\ncase of \"ancient _liberty_ recovered to heroic song from this\ntroublesome and modern bondage of riming.\"\n\nThere is yet one reason more why we at Yale should keep this\nanniversary.  Milton was the poet of English Puritanism, and therefore\nhe is our poet.  This colony and this college were founded by English\nPuritans; and here the special faith and manners of the Puritans\nsurvived later than at the other great University of New\nEngland--survived almost in their integrity down to a time within the\nmemory of living men.  When Milton left Cambridge in 1632,\n\"church-outed by the prelates,\" it was among the possibilities that,\ninstead of settling down at his father's country-house at Horton, he\nmight have come to New England.  Winthrop had sailed, with his company,\ntwo years before.  In 1635 three thousand Puritans emigrated to\nMassachusetts, among them Sir Henry Vane, the younger,--the \"Vane,\nyoung in years, but in sage counsels old,\" of Milton's sonnet--who was\nmade governor of the colony in the following year.  Or in 1638, the\nyear of the settlement of New Haven, when Milton went to Italy for\nculture, it would not have been miraculous had he come instead to\nAmerica for freedom.  It was in that same year that, according to a\nstory long believed though now discredited, Cromwell, Pym, Hampden and\nHazelrig, despairing of any improvement in conditions at home, were\nabout to embark for New England when they were stopped by orders in\ncouncil.  Is it too wild a dream that _Paradise Lost_ might have been\nwritten in Boston or in New Haven?  But it was not upon the cards.  The\nliterary class does not willingly emigrate to raw lands, or separate\nitself from the thick and ripe environment of an old civilization.\nHowever, we know that Vane and Roger Williams were friends of Milton;\nand he must have known and been known to Cromwell's chaplain, Hugh\nPeters, who had been in New England; and doubtless to others among the\ncolonists.  It is, at first sight, therefore rather strange that there\nis no mention of Milton, so far as I have observed, in any of our\nearlier colonial writers.  It is said, I know not on what authority,\nthat there was not a single copy of Shakspere's plays in New England in\nthe seventeenth century.  That is not so strange, considering the\nPuritan horror of the stage.  But one might have expected to meet with\nmention of Milton, as a controversialist if not as a poet.  The French\nHuguenot poet DuBartas, whose poem _La Semaine_ contributed some items\nto the account of the creation in _Paradise Lost_, was a favorite\nauthor in New England--I take it, in Sylvester's translation, _The\nDivine Weeks and Works_.  It is also said that the _Emblems_ of\nMilton's contemporary, Francis Quarles, were much read in New England.\nBut Tyler supposes that Nathaniel Ames, in his Almanac for 1725,\n\"pronounced there for the first time the name of Milton, together with\nchosen passages from his poems.\"  And he thinks it worth noting that\nLewis Morris, of Morrisania, ordered an edition of Milton from a London\nbookseller in 1739.*\n\n\n* Mr. Charles Francis Adams informs me that a letter of inquiry sent by\nhim to the _Evening Post_ has brought out three or four references to\nMilton in the _Magnalia_, besides other allusions to him in the\npublications of the period.  Mr. Adams adds, however, that there is\nnothing to show that _Paradise Lost_ was much read in New England prior\nto 1750.  The _Magnalia_ was published in 1702.\n\n\nThe failure of our forefathers to recognize the great poet of their\ncause may be explained partly by the slowness of the growth of Milton's\nfame in England.  His minor poems, issued in 1645, did not reach a\nsecond edition till 1673.  _Paradise Lost_, printed in 1667, found its\nfit audience, though few, almost immediately.  But the latest\nliterature traveled slowly in those days into a remote and rude\nprovince.  Moreover the educated class in New England, the ministers,\nthough a learned, were not a literary set, as is abundantly shown by\ntheir own experiments in verse.  It is not unlikely that Cotton Mather\nor Michael Wigglesworth would have thought DuBartas and Quarles better\npoets than Milton if they had read the latter's works.\n\nWe are proud of being the descendants of the Puritans; perhaps we are\nglad that we are their descendants only, and not their contemporaries.\nWhich side would you have been on, if you had lived during the English\ncivil war of the seventeenth century?  Doubtless it would have depended\nlargely on whether you lived in Middlesex or in Devon, whether your\nparents were gentry or tradespeople, and on similar accidents.  We\nthink that we choose, but really choices are made for us.  We inherit\nour politics and our religion.  But if free to choose, I know in which\ncamp I would have been, and it would not have been that in which\nMilton's friends were found.  The New Model army had the\ndiscipline--and the prayer meetings.  I am afraid that Rupert's\ntroopers plundered, gambled, drank and swore most shockingly.  There\nwas good fighting on both sides, but the New Model had the right end of\nthe quarrel and had the victory, and I am glad that it was so.  Still\nthere was more fun in the king's army, and it was there that most of\nthe good fellows were.\n\nThe influence of Milton's religion upon his art has been much\ndiscussed.  It was owing to his Puritanism that he was the kind of poet\nthat he was, but it was in spite of his Puritanism that he was a poet\nat all.  He was the poet of a cause, a party, a sect whose attitude\ntoward the graces of life and the beautiful arts was notoriously one of\ndistrust and hostility.  He was the poet, not only of that Puritanism\nwhich is a permanent element in English character, but of much that was\nmerely temporary and local.  How sensitive then must his mind have been\nto all forms of loveliness, how powerful the creative instinct in him,\nwhen his genius emerged without a scar from the long struggle of twenty\nyears, during which he had written pamphlet after pamphlet on the angry\nquestions of the day, and nothing at all in verse but a handful of\nsonnets mostly provoked by public occasions!\n\nThe fact is, there were all kinds of Puritans.  There were dismal\nprecisians, like William Prynne, illiberal and vulgar fanatics, the\nTribulation Wholesomes, Hope-on-high Bombys, and Zeal-of-the-land\nBusys, whose absurdities were the stock in trade of contemporary\nsatirists from Jonson to Butler.  But there were also gentlemen and\nscholars, like Fairfax, Marvell, Colonel Hutchinson, Vane, whose\nPuritanism was consistent with all elegant tastes and accomplishments.\nWas Milton's Puritanism hurtful to his art?  No and yes.  It was in\nmany ways an inspiration; it gave him zeal, a Puritan word much\nridiculed by the Royalists; it gave refinement, distinction,\nselectness, elevation to his picture of the world.  But it would be\nuncritical to deny that it also gave a certain narrowness and rigidity\nto his view of human life.\n\nIt is curious how Milton's early poems have changed places in favor\nwith _Paradise Lost_.  They were neglected for over a century.  Joseph\nWarton testifies in 1756 that they had only \"very lately met with a\nsuitable regard\"; had lain \"in a sort of obscurity, the private\nenjoyment of a few curious readers.\"  And Dr. Johnson exclaims: \"Surely\nno man could have fancied that he read _Lycidas_ with pleasure, had he\nnot known its author.\"  There can be little doubt that now-a-days\nMilton's juvenilia are more read than _Paradise Lost_, and by\nmany--perhaps by a majority of readers--rated higher.  In this opinion\nI do not share.  _Paradise Lost_ seems to me not only greater work,\nmore important, than the minor pieces, but better poetry, richer and\nperfecter.  Yet one quality these early poems have which _Paradise\nLost_ has not--charm.  Milton's epic astonishes, moves, delights, but\nit does not fascinate.  The youthful Milton was sensitive to many\nattractions which he afterwards came to look upon with stern\ndisapproval.  He went to the theatre and praised the comedies of\nShakspere and Jonson; he loved the romances of chivalry and fairy\ntales; he had no objection to dancing, ale drinking, the music of the\nfiddle and rural sports; he writes to Diodati of the pretty girls on\nthe London streets; he celebrates the Catholic and Gothic elegancies of\nEnglish church architecture and ritual, the cloister's pale, the organ\nmusic and full voiced choir, the high embowed roof, and the storied\nwindows which his military friends were soon to smash at Ely,\nSalisbury, Canterbury, Lichfield, as popish idolatries.  But in\n_Iconoclastes_ we find him sneering at the king for keeping a copy of\nShakspere in his closet.  In his treatise _Of Reformation_ he denounces\nthe prelates for \"embezzling the treasury of the church on painted and\ngilded walls of temples, wherein God hath testified to have no\ndelight.\"  Evidently the Anglican service was one of those \"gay\nreligions, rich with pomp and gold\" to which he alludes in _Paradise\nLost_.  A chorus commends Samson the Nazarene for drinking nothing but\nwater.  Modern tragedies are condemned for \"mixing comic stuff with\ntragic sadness and gravity, or introducing trivial and vulgar\npersons\"--as Shakspere does.  In _Paradise Lost_ the poet speaks with\ncontempt of the romances whose \"chief mastery\" it was\n\n            --to dissect,\n  With long and tedious havoc, fabled knights\n  In battles feigned.\"\n\nAnd in _Paradise Regained_ he even disparages his beloved classics,\npreferring the psalms of David, the Hebrew prophecies and the Mosaic\nlaw, to the poets, philosophers and orators of Athens.\n\nThe Puritans were Old Testament men.  Their God was the Hebrew Jehovah,\ntheir imaginations were filled with the wars of Israel and the militant\ntheocracy of the Jews.  In Milton's somewhat patronizing attitude\ntoward women, there is something Mosaic--something almost Oriental.  He\nalways remained susceptible to beauty in women, but he treated it as a\nweakness, a temptation.  The bitterness of his own marriage experience\nmingles with his words.  I need not cite the well-known passages about\nDalilah and Eve, where he who reads between the lines can always detect\nthe figure of Mary Powell.  There is no gallantry in Milton, but a deal\nof common sense.  The love of the court poets, cavaliers and\nsonneteers, their hyperboles of passion, their abasement before their\nladies he doubtless scorned as the fopperies of chivalry, fantastic and\nunnatural exaggerations, the insincerities of \"vulgar amourists,\" the\nfume of\n\n            \"--court amour,\n  Mixt dance, or wanton mask, or midnight ball,\n  Or serenate which the starved lover sings\n  To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain.\"\n\n\nTo the Puritan, woman was at best the helpmate and handmaid of man.\nToo often she was a snare, or a household foe, \"a cleaving mischief far\nwithin defensive arms.\"  _L'Allegro_ and _Il Penseroso_ are the only\npoems of Milton in which he surrenders himself spontaneously to the joy\nof living, to \"unreproved pleasures free,\" with no _arriere pensee_, or\nintrusion of the conscience.  Even in those pleasant Horatian lines to\nLawrence, inviting him to spend a winter day by the fire, drink wine\nand hear music, he ends with a fine Puritan touch:\n\n  He who of these delights can judge, yet spare\n  To interpose them oft, is truly wise.\"\n\n\n\"Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more\ncakes and ale?\" inquires Sir Toby of Shakspere's only Puritan.\n\n\"Yes,\" adds the clown, \"and ginger shall be hot in the mouth, too.\"\nAnd \"wives may be merry and yet honest,\" asserts Mistress Page.\n\nIt is not without astonishment that one finds Emerson writing: \"To this\nantique heroism Milton added the genius of the Christian sanctity * * *\nlaying its chief stress on humility.\"  Milton had a zeal for\nrighteousness, a noble purity and noble pride.  But if you look for\nsaintly humility, for the spirit of the meek and lowly Jesus, the\nspirit of charity and forgiveness, look for them in the Anglican\nHerbert, not in the Puritan Milton.  Humility was no fruit of the\nsystem which Calvin begot and which begot John Knox.  The Puritans were\ngreat invokers of the sword of the Lord and of Gideon--the sword of\nGideon and the dagger of Ehud.  There went a sword out of Milton's\nmouth against the enemies of Israel, a sword of threatenings, the wrath\nof God upon the ungodly.  The temper of his controversial writings is\nlittle short of ferocious.  There was not much in him of that \"sweet\nreasonableness\" which Matthew Arnold thought the distinctive mark of\nChristian ethics.  He was devout, but not with the Christian\ndevoutness.  I would not call him a Christian at all, except, of\ncourse, in his formal adherence to the creed of Christianity.  Very\nsignificant is the inferiority of _Paradise Regained_ to _Paradise\nLost_.  And in _Paradise Lost_ itself, how weak and faint is the\ncharacter of the Savior!  You feel that he is superfluous, that the\npoet did not need him.  He is simply the second person of the Trinity,\nthe executive arm of the Godhead; and Milton is at pains to invent\nthings for him to do--to drive the rebellious angels out of heaven, to\npreside over the six days' work of creation, etc.  I believe it was\nThomas Davidson who said that in _Paradise Lost_ \"Christ is God's good\nboy.\"\n\nWe are therefore not unprepared to discover, from Milton's _Treatise of\nChristian Doctrine_, that he had laid aside the dogma of vicarious\nsacrifice and was, in his last years, a Unitarian.  It was this Latin\ntreatise, translated and published in 1824, which called out Macaulay's\nessay, so urbanely demolished by Matthew Arnold, and which was\ntriumphantly reviewed by Dr. Channing in the _North American_.  It was\nlucky for Dr. Channing, by the way, that he lived in the nineteenth\ncentury and not in the seventeenth.  Two Socinians, Leggatt and\nWightman, were burned at the stake as late as James the First's reign,\none at Lichfield and the other at Smithfield.\n\nMilton, then, does not belong with those broadly human, all tolerant,\nimpartial artists, who reflect, with equal sympathy and infinite\ncuriosity, every phase of life: with Shakspere and Goethe or, on a\nlower level, with Chaucer and Montaigne; but with the intense, austere\nand lofty souls whose narrowness is likewise their strength.  His place\nis beside Dante, the Catholic Puritan.",
