    "body": "About four o'clock on a September morning of 1665,--when the sun was\nnot yet shining upon his windows facing the Artillery Fields, and the\nautumnal dew lay wet upon his garden leaves,--John Milton awoke with\nhis customary punctuality, and, true to his austere and abstemious mode\nof life, wasted no time over comfortable indolence. He rose and\nproceeded to dress, with the help of his manservant Greene. For,\nalthough he was but fifty-four years in age, his hands were partly\ncrippled with gout and chalkstones, and his eyes, clear, bright and blue\nas they had always been to outward seeming, were both stone-blind.\n\nMilton still retained much of that personal comeliness which had won\nhim, at Cambridge, the nickname of \"Lady of Christ's College.\" His\noriginal red and white had now become a uniform pallor; his thick,\nlight brown hair, parted at the top, and curling richly on his\nshoulders--(no close-cropt Roundhead this!)--was beginning to fade\ntowards grey. But his features were noble and symmetrical; he was\nwell-built and well-proportioned; and he was justified in priding\nhimself upon a personal appearance which he had never neglected or\ndespised. In his own words, he was \"neither large nor small: at no time\nhad he been considered ugly; and in youth, with a sword by his side, he\nhad never feared the bravest.\"\n\nSuch was the man who now, neatly dressed in black, was led into his\nstudy, upon the same floor as his bedroom,--a small chamber hung with\nrusty green,--and there, seated in a large old elbow-chair, received the\nmorning salutations of his three daughters.\n\nOne after another they entered the room, and each bestowed a\ncharacteristic greeting upon her father. Anne, the eldest, a handsome\ngirl of twenty, was lame, and had a slight impediment in her speech. She\nbade him good-morning with a stammering carelessness, enquired casually\nas to his night's rest, and stared out of window, palpably bored at the\ncommencement of another monotonous, irksome day. Mary, the second,\n--dark, impetuous, and impatient,--was in a state of smouldering\nrebellion. She addressed him in a tone of almost insolent mock-civility,\n--he must needs have been deaf as well as blind not to detect the\nunfilial dislike beneath her words. Ten-year-old Deborah, the most\naffectionate of the three, ventured to kiss her father, even to stroke\nhis long, beautiful hair, and to re-tie the tassels of his collar.\n\n\"Mary will read to me this morning,\" said Milton, gravely inclining his\nhead in acknowledgment of Deborah's attentions. The dark girl, with a\nmutinous shrug of her shoulders, sat down and began to read aloud, in a\nhard, uninterested voice, out of the great leather-bound Hebrew Old\nTestament which lay upon the table. And not one single sentence did she\nunderstand--not one word of what she was reading.\n\nJohn Milton's theories of education, which he had expounded at length in\npamphlets, were a curious blend of the practical and the ideal. Vastly\nin advance of his time in his demand for a practical training, he had\nevolved that \"fine definition which has never been improved upon,\"--\"I\ncall a complete and generous education that which fits a man to perform,\njustly, skilfully and magnanimously, all the offices, both private and\npublic, of peace and war.\" But he made no allowances for slowness or\nstupidity: all his schemes were based upon the existence of scholars\nequally gifted with himself. And he entirely left out of all\ncalculations, much as a Mahommedan might, that complex organism the\nfemale mind. He wished it, one must conjecture, to remain a blank. So\nhis daughters had received no systematic schooling, only some sort of\nhome-instruction from a governess. And he had himself trained them to\nread aloud in five or six languages,--French, Italian, Latin, Greek,\nHebrew and even Syriac,--in total ignorance of the meaning.\n\"One tongue,\" observed Milton brusquely, almost brutally, \"is enough\nfor any woman.\"\n\nMary read on, steadily, stolidly, sullenly, for a full hour. The others\nhad left the room and were busy upon household tasks. At the conclusion\nof two chapters, \"Leave me,\" commanded Milton, \"I would be alone now for\ncontemplation,\"--and Mary willingly escaped to breakfast.\n\nThe great poet reclined in his chair,--wrapt in such solemn and\nmelancholy meditation as might have served as the model for his own\n_Penseroso_. A severe composure suffused his fine features, a serious\nsadness looked out of his unclouded eyes; his entire expression was\n\"that of English intrepidity mixed with unutterable sorrow.\" For Milton\nwas a bitterly disappointed man.\n\nIt was not merely his comparative poverty,--because the Restoration,\nbesides depriving him of his post as Latin or Foreign Secretary to the\nCommonwealth Council of State, had reduced his means from various\nsources almost to vanishing point.\n\nNor was his melancholy mainly the result of his affliction; that he had\ndeliberately incurred, and was as deliberately enduring. Constant\nheadaches, late study, and perpetual recourse to one nostrum after\nanother, had eventuated in the certainty of total blindness if he\npersisted in his mode of work.\n\n    \"The choice lay before me between dereliction of a supreme duty and\n     loss of eyesight; ... and I therefore concluded to employ the\n     little remaining eyesight I was to enjoy in doing this, the\n     greatest service to the common weal it was in my power to render.\"\n\nNo: it was not a personal matter which could sadden John Milton to the\nvery roots of his stern, ambitious, courageous soul. It was the\ncontravention of all that he held most dear in life,--the frustration,\nas he conceived it, of that liberty which was his very heart's blood by\nthe Restoration of the Stuart monarchy. He had resolved, in his own\nwords, to transfer into the struggle for liberty \"all my genius and all\nthe strength of my industry.\" It appeared that he had flung away both\nin vain. The Stuart monarchy, to him, lay monstrously black,\novershadowing all the land, like his own conception of Satan.\n\nThe Restoration was not merely the political defeat of his party, it was\nthe total defeat of the principles, of the religious and social ideals,\nwith which Milton's life was bound up. He had always stood aloof from\nthe other salient men of the time. Of Cromwell he had practically no\npersonal knowledge: with the bulk of the Presbyterians he was openly at\nenmity. \"Shut away behind a barrier of his own ideas,\" he did not care\nto associate with men of less lofty intellectual standing. But now he\nwas even more isolated. Since the downfall of the Puritan r\u00e9gime, he of\nnecessity \"stood alone, and became the party himself.\" And he presented,\nin his _Samson Agonistes_, \"the intensest utterance of the most intense\nof English poets--the agonised cry of the beaten party,\" condensed into\nthe expression of one unflinching and heroic soul.\n\nUpon the mysterious and inscrutable decrees of Providence, which had\nlaid in the dust what seemed to him the very cause of God, Milton sat\nand pondered, in a despondency so profound, a disappointment so\npoignant, that his own great lines had sought in vain to voice it:\n\n    \"... I feel my genial spirits droop,\n    My hopes all flat: Nature within me seems\n    In all her functions weary of herself;\n    My race of glory run, and race of shame,\n    And I shall shortly be with them that rest.\"\n\n                          (_Samson Agonistes_).\n\nYet his indomitable spirit was by no means quenched in despair: and an\noutlet was now open to him at last, which for eighteen years he had\nforegone,--the outlet of poetic expression. He was conscious of his\ncapacity to travel and to traverse the regions which none had dared\nexplore save Dante. And with that tremendous chief of pioneers he was\nmeasuring himself, man to man.\n\nHe was able, above the turmoil of faction and the tumult of conflicting\ntroubles, to weigh\n\n    \"... his spread wings, at leisure to behold\n    Far off the empyreal Heaven, extended wide\n    In circuit, undetermined square or round,\n    With opal towers and battlements adorned\n    Of living sapphire, once his native seat.\"\n\n                           (_Paradise Lost_).\n\nThat Milton had been silent for so long a period was due, firstly to his\npreoccupation with political and polemical questions, into which he had\nthrown the whole weight of his mind; and, secondly, to the effect of his\nown firm resolve that the great epic, which, he had always secretly\nintended, should be the outcome of matured and ripened powers: the\napotheosis of all that was worthiest in him: the full fruit of his\nstrenuous life. He had long since arrived at that conclusion, never\nsurpassed in its terseness and truth, that true poetry must be \"simple,\nsensuous, impassioned,\"--words which might serve as the text and\ntouchstone of art. \"And long it was not after\" when he\n\n    \"was confirmed in this opinion, that he who would not be frustrate of\n     his hope to write well hereafter in laudable things, ought himself to\n     be a true poem.\"\n\nFor poetry, to John Milton, was no sounding brass or tinkling cymbal; in\nhis hand \"the thing became a trumpet,\" apt to seraphic usages and the\nrallying of celestial cohorts.\n\nTherefore, when he ceased to touch the \"tender stops of various quills\"\nthat trembled into silence in _Lycidas_, it was not as one discomfited\nof his attainment. Rather it was as one convinced of a mighty purpose,\nand patiently awaiting the just time of its fulfilment. The \"woodnotes\nwild\" of _Comus_, the exquisitely stippled _genre_ painting of\n_Allegro_ and _Penseroso_, were mere childish attempts compared with\nthat monumental work to which Milton firmly proposed to devote the\nfruition of his genius. And now, having become a man through mental and\nphysical experience even more than through the passage of years, he had\nput away childish things. He had resolved at last upon, and had at last\nundertaken, the one subject most congenial to his taste, and most\nsuitable to his style and diction. _Paradise Lost_ was the triumphant\noffspring of his brain. It had sprung, like light, from chaos. Out of\nthe darkness of poverty, blindness and defeat arose the poem which was\nto set him on the pinnacles of Parnassus.\n\n\"You make many enquiries as to what I am about\" he wrote in bygone years to\nhis old schoolfellow, Charles Diodati. \"What am I thinking of? Why with\nGod's help, of immortality! Forgive the word, I only whisper it in your\near. Yes, I am pluming my wings for a flight.\" Nor was this the idle\nboasting of an egotist, the empty imagination of a dreamer.\n\nConsumed by \"the desire of honour and repute and universal fame,\nseated,\" as he put it, \"in the breast of every true scholar,\" Milton\nsedulously and assiduously had prepared himself for the achievement of\nhis aims. That he should \"strictly meditate the thankless Muse\" required\na certain self-control. \"To scorn delights and live laborious days\" is\nnot the customary delight of a handsome young scholar, expert in\nswordsmanship as in languages. To equip himself for his self-chosen\ntask, still a misty, undefined prospect in the remotest future, required\nstrenuous and disciplined study; and necessitated his forgoing too\nfrequently the scenes of rustic happiness which he had pictured so\ncharmingly in _L'Allegro_,--absenting himself from \"The groves and\nruins, and the beloved village elms ... where I too, among rural scenes\nand remote forests, seemed as if I could have grown and vegetated\nthrough a hidden eternity.\"\n\nAnd this, though Milton had neither the eye nor the ear of a born\nnature-lover, was in itself a sufficient deprivation and sacrifice. For\nbeauty appealed to him with a most earnest insistence,--and the purer,\nthe more abstract form it took, the more urgent was that appeal. \"God\nhas instilled into me, at all events,\" he declared, \"a vehement love of\nthe beautiful. Not with so much labour is Ceres said to have sought\nProserpine, as I am wont, day and night, to search for the idea of the\nbeautiful through all forms and faces of things, and to follow it\nleading me on with certain assured traces.\"\n\nYet not alone among \"forms and faces\" was he predestined to discover\nthat Absolute Beauty. The passionate love of music, so frequently\ncharacteristic of a great linguist, which led him into sound-worlds as\nwell as sight-worlds, was fated to remain with him, an incalculable\nconsolation, when \"forms and faces\" could be no more seen. And into the\nvocabulary of _Paradise Lost_, that incomparably rich vocabulary, with\nits infallible ear for rhythm, for phrase, for magnificent consonantal\neffects and the magic of great names that reverberate through open\nvowels,--into this he poured forth his whole sense of beautiful sound,\n\n         \"as the wakeful bird\n    Sings darkling, and in shadiest covert hid,\n    Tunes her nocturnal note.\"\n\n_Paradise Lost_ remains, as has been observed, \"The elaborated outcome\nof all the best words of all antecedent poetry--the language of one who\nlives in the companionship of the great and the wise of all past time,\nequally magnificent in verbiage, whether describing man, or God, or the\nArch-Enemy visiting\" this pendent world, when\n\n    Thither, full fraught with mischievous revenge,\n    Accursed, and in a cursed hour, he lives.\n\nAt seven o'clock the body-servant Greene re-entered, followed by Mrs.\nMilton, the poet's third wife, and by Mary Fisher, their maid-servant,\nbringing in his breakfast, a light, slight repast. Mrs. Milton, _n\u00e9e_\nElizabeth Minshull, of Nantwich, was a comely, active, capable woman,\n\"of a peaceful and agreeable humour,\" so far at least as her husband was\nconcerned: for she shared the traditional destiny of a stepmother in not\n\"hitting it off\" with the first wife's daughters. Her golden hair and\ncalm commonsense were in striking contrast, alike with the dark beauty\nand petulant spirit of Mary Powell, and with the fragile sweetness of\nCatherine Woodcock, Milton's former spouses. If she did not in her heart\nconfirm her husband's celebrated theory of the relative position of man\nand wife,--\"He for God only, she for God in him,\"--(which, it has been\nsaid, \"condenses every fallacy about woman's true relation to her\nhusband and to her Maker\"), she managed very adroitly to convey an\nimpression of entire acquiescence in the will of her lord. And at least\nshe was entirely adequate as a housewife.\n\nHad Milton ever encountered that \"not impossible She\" whom he portrayed\nin his ideal Eve? or was this latter a mere visionary abstract of great\nqualities, \"to show us how divine a thing a woman may be made\"? Neither\nof his three wives, nor yet that \"very handsome and witty gentlewoman,\"\nMiss Davis, to whom he had at one time paid his addresses, conformed to\nthis description: one cannot even conjecture that it was a _pasticcio_\nof their respective fine attributes.\n\nMrs. Milton, third of that name, as she bustled and busied herself about\nthe study, was by no means a new Eve. She regarded her husband's\nambitions and achievements with that good natured tolerance so\ncharacteristic of the materially-minded. Only genius can appreciate\ngenius; and the man who shut himself away from his _confr\u00e8res_ in\nscholarship and literature was not likely to unbosom himself to his\nhousewifely, provincial wife.\n\n\n    COMUS.   _Painting by S. Meteyard._\n\n    Sabrina rises attended by water nymphs,\n        \"By the rushy-fringed bank,\n        Where grows the willow and the osier dank,\"\n\n                                         (_Comus_).\n\n\nThe manservant Greene, breakfast being concluded, read aloud, or wrote\nto his master's dictation for some hours. This had formerly been the\ngirls' daily office, but they were revolting more and more,--the whole\nposition was becoming untenable, for they resented the presence of their\nstepmother as much as they disliked the duties which fettered them to\ntheir father's side, and forced them to parrot-like, futile drudgery in\nunknown tongues. To-day, however, Greene was relieved of the task, for\nwhich he was manifestly but ill-fitted, by the entrance of Milton's two\nfavourite visitors.\n\nNo celebrity ever had fewer friends. From all who might have called\nthemselves such, he was separated by hostility of party, rancour of\nsect or by that almost repellent isolation of character to which\nreference has already been made. When at the highest of his political\nfame, he had almost boasted himself of this \"splendid isolation,\"--\"I\nhave very little acquaintance with those in power, inasmuch as I keep\nvery much to my own house, and prefer to do so.\" At heart a Republican\nbeyond the conception of any Roundhead,--cherishing a form of religion\nso recondite that it could be classed under no heading, since he ignored\nboth public worship and family prayer,--having given offence to all and\nsundry by his outspoken theories upon divorce and divine right,--Milton\npresented to most men a dangerous personality. And most of all now, when\nthe wits of the Restoration rou\u00e9s could be sharpened upon him, and when\nthe heathen, as he considered them, roistered and ruffled it through the\ncity that had \"returned to her wallowing in the mire.\"\n\nYet those who had sat at his feet as pupils, retained a singular\naffection for their former master. For all such young folk as adopted\nthe disciple's attitude, the stern self-contained man had a very soft\nspot in his heart. With such, he was not only instructive, but genial,\nalmost cheerful; and they alone could move him to the only utterances\nwhich were neither \"solemn, serious or sad.\" Chief among his former\npupils were those who now made entrance--Henry Lawrence and Cyriac\nSkinner.\n\nIt may be guessed, therefore, with what pleasure the blind poet received\nthese loyal and affectionate men. His pensive face became transformed\nwith interest and animation, as with gentle courtesy and unfeigned\ndelight he turned his sightless eyes from one speaker to another. Upon\nevery subject he had a ready flow of easy, colloquial conversation,\nseasoned with shrewd satire: his deep and musical voice ran up and down\nthe whole gamut of worthy topics. Sometimes he fell into the stately,\nalmost stilted diction of his great prose pamphlets,--sometimes he spoke\nin racy English vernacular,--sometimes, warming to his subject, he\nassumed an almost fiery eloquence. But when, at twelve o'clock, he was\nescorted downstairs to dinner in the parlour, the metamorphosis was\ncomplete. This was no longer the brooding introspective man of the early\nmorning, but one \"extreme pleasant in his conversation,\" almost merry in\nsociety so congenial,--the life of the party: abstinent, but not ascetic,\nhaving a healthy, human enjoyment of the dishes set before him.\n\n\"These are the victuals most to my liking,\" he observed as he ate,\n\"being seasonable and withal of no great cost. For that which is of great\nrarity or richness, and must be procured with care or toil, hath no\ntemptation for me.\"\n\n\"I do always my best, Mr. Milton,\" replied his wife, \"that you shall be\nwell satisfied: and methinks to-day I have hit your taste right fairly.\"\n\n\"God ha' mercy, Betty,\" said Milton, regarding her with an air of kindly\ntolerance, \"I see thou wilt perform according to thy promise in providing\nme such dishes as I think fit while I live; and when I die, thou knowest\nI have left thee all.\" Here Anne, Mary and Deborah sat up very straight,\nand directed looks of fury and astonishment towards their stepmother.\n\n\"Talk not o' dying, in God's name, man,\" responded the embarrassed Betty,\n\"we have enough to do to make shift to live, nowadays,\" and she hastily\npressed her good but simple fare, homely Cheshire dishes well-prepared,\nupon the two guests. \"Such a many learned foreign folk have visited our\npoor house these latter days,--time hath failed me for my\ncheese-cakes,--and of the havercakes I made two days agone, why, not a\ncrumb is left. But eat, my masters, eat and drink. Though these be but\ncountry victuals, none of your Court kickshaws, I warrant you they are\nfresh and savoury. I would commend you, now, to this rabbit pie--\"\n\n\"Peace, Betty, peace. The woman prates o' pies like a pie (magpie)\nherself. What saith the Apostle? _I suffer not a woman to speak_ in\npresence of the man's authority. Ha' done, good Betty, with thy harping\non kitchen matters,--let thy savoury messes be companioned with a sauce\nof silence.\"\n\nTemporary eclipse of Mrs. Milton: obvious and malevolent satisfaction of\nAnne and Mary: desperately suppressed inclination to giggle on the part\nof little Deborah: and a desire to cover up the situation with talk, as\nregards kindly Lawrence and courtly Skinner.\n\nThe \"foreign folk\" were no new thing. Milton's fame, indeed, was European:\nas a prose-writer and pamphleteer, be it understood, not as a poet. Had\nhe not refuted and put to shame the most erudite scholars of the day?\nForeign _savants_ of note, therefore, who might be visiting London, were\ndesirous to acquaint themselves with so powerful a personality: and the\nlittle house in the Artillery Walk was the rendezvous for many\ndistinguished persons. They found their host no such recluse as town-talk\nmight have led them to imagine, but one ready and willing to converse\nwith them,--an English gentleman to the backbone, a scholar and artist\nto the finger-tips. His Continental tours and Italian sojourns had made\nhim less insular than most of his compatriots, and his vast range of\nreading had imparted a certain cosmopolitanism to his exceedingly\nindividual lines of thought. The visitors found him, moreover, employed\nupon a work so important, and of a theme so lofty, as might well give\nthem pause, considering the circumstances under which it was being\naccomplished: and whatever their particular religious tenets might be,\nthey could not fail to admire the magnitude of his aim in composing\n_Paradise Lost_,--\"To justify the ways of God to men.\"\n\n\n    PARADISE LOST. BK. II   _Painting by S. Meteyard._\n\n    \"Satan with less toil, and now with ease, ...\n    Weighs his spread wings, at leisure to behold ...\n      This pendent world in bigness as a star\n    Of smallest magnitude.\"\n\n                            (_Paradise Lost. Bk. II._)\n\n\nDinner despatched, the master of the house, led by his devoted friends,\nwent out into the garden. A garden was the desideratum of his existence,\nand he had never been without one; for in seventeenth-century London\nevery house was fitly furnished in this respect. Here Milton was in the\nhabit of taking that steady exercise which was a _sine qu\u00e2 non_ to a\nsedentary and gouty man. He made a point of walking up and down out of\ndoors, in cold weather, for three or four hours at a time,--sometimes\ncomposing his majestic lines, sometimes merely meditating. When weary\nwith walking, he would come in and either dictate what he had conceived,\nor would take further exercise in a swing. In really warm weather, he\nreceived his visitors sitting outside his house door, wrapped in a\ncoarse grey overcoat--gazing out upon the fields of the Artillery ground\nwith those \"unblemished eyes\" that belied their own clear beauty--\"the\nonly point,\" as he said, \"in which I am against my will a hypocrite.\"\nTo-day, being cool and cloudy, allowed but intermittent periods in the\nopen air. Milton, Lawrence and Skinner paced slowly to and fro, deep in\nenthralling intercourse, until three o'clock: when the rain and Thomas\nElwood arrived simultaneously, and the other two men departed to their\nrespective avocations.\n\nThomas Elwood was a young Quaker of twenty-three, who was acting in some\ndegree as honorary secretary to Milton. Himself of a defective education,\nand having been expelled from his father's house on account of his\nreligious opinions, he was only too glad to take a lodging in the\nneighbourhood, and, by reading aloud to Milton every afternoon, acquire\nan amount of information and a variety of learning, which by no other\nmeans could he have obtained. And there was also a tacit sympathy\nbetween them, insomuch as Milton was, more and more, as life went on,\ninclining towards the Quaker tenets,--in those days, _bien entendu_,\nviewed with horror and detestation by the majority of men.\n\nHaving re-entered the house, \"We will not read as yet, Tom,\" Milton said,\n\"I desire greatly to comfort myself with sweet sounds. Bring me into the\nwithdrawing-room, and place me at the organ. A little bellows-blowing\nwill not hurt thee, Tom. And let my wife attend me, that we may have\nsong withal. She hath a good voice, though a poor ear.\"\n\nSeated at his beloved instrument, the blind man steeped himself in the\nprincipal pleasure that was left him. Milton's father, stout Puritan\nthough he might be, was an accomplished musician, and had taught his\nson to play in early youth. The austerities of a narrow dogma had not\nbeen able to crush out the inveterate artistry of either father or\nson: and now the devotee of \"divinest Melancholy\" was able to solace\nhimself with such lovely concords, such \"anthems clear,\"\n\n    \"As may with sweetness, through mine ear,\n     Dissolve me into ecstasies,\n     And bring all heaven before mine eyes.\"\n\nSometimes he sang as he played; sometimes Mrs. Milton, with her clear\nunemotional notes, sang to his accompaniment. Presently, that Elwood\nshould not be wearied in his blowing, he quitted the organ for the\nbass-viol, on which he was no mean performer. At the conclusion of his\nplaying he sat with a rapt, transfigured face, such as might well have\ncalled forth the Italian's encomium, thirty years before,--\"If thy piety\nwere equal to thy understanding, figure, eloquence, beauty and manners,\nverily thou wouldest not be an Angle but an Angel!\"\n\n\"And, now, good Tom,\" quoth Milton to the young man, \"let us to work: the\nday moves on apace.\" They went upstairs to the study. \"Before we read, I\nhave some forty lines to set down,\" continued the poet, \"all day they\nhave been knocking for admission, and with that last music they made\nentrance. Needs must I house them now in ink and paper.\"\n\n\"I am instant at thy bidding, friend,\" and Elwood seated himself with\ndutiful alacrity at the table. Milton, placing himself obliquely athwart\nhis elbow-chair, with one leg thrown across the arm, dictated forty\nlines, almost in a breath,--they burst from him, as it would seem, in a\nstream no longer to be restrained.\n\n\"Gently, gently, good sir!\" exclaimed Elwood, \"slow-witted and slow\nfingered I may be,--but I cannot keep pace with thee!\"\n\nA grim smile hovered over Milton's full lips, \"Out of practice, Tom,\" he\nreplied indulgently, \"it is a long while since I required this service\nat thy hands. From the autumnal to the vernal equinox, as I have told\nthee, my muse lies dumb,\n            and silent as the moon,\n    When she deserts the night,\n    Hid in her vacant interlunar cave.\n\n\nBut now the winter is overpast, the singing of birds is heard in our\nland, and she too awakes and sings. With the vernal equinox my thoughts\nflow free as Helicon.\" Then, with slow and deliberate diction, he\nrepeated the lines once more: and, having had them read aloud to him, he\ncompressed, condensed, concentrated every thought and phrase, and\nreduced them to twenty.\n\n\"There is more to come?\" queried Elwood, his quill poised ready to write.\n\n\"No more. Not one word more at present,\" replied Milton, sighing as\nthough somewhat exhausted.\n\nHis inspiration was entirely intermittent: and sometimes he would lie\nawake all night, trying, but without success, to complete one single\nline to his liking. \"They please me not wholly, these lines,\" he\ncontinued, \"much remains to be done before I set them down to be changed\nno more.\"\n\n\"Not every man would say so,\" replied Elwood, \"the learning and\nerudition whereof these few lines alone give witness, would supply many\nwith just cause for boasting throughout a lifetime.\"\n\nMilton shook his head. \"Pomp and ostentation of reading,\" he remarked,\n\"is admired among the vulgar: but in matters of religion, he is\nlearnedest who is plainest.\"\n\n\n    IL PENSEROSO.   _Painting by S. Meteyard._\n\n        \"And may at last my weary age\n        Find out the peaceful hermitage,\n        The hairy gown and mossy cell,\n        Where I may sit and rightly spell\n        Of every star that heaven doth show.\"\n\n                           (_Il Penseroso._)\n\n\n\"Yet, Mr. Milton, thee hast the reputation of such scope and range of\nwisdom, as the greatest scholar in Europe might fitly envy. To me, I\nconfess, in my poor unlettered ignorance, it is not conceivable in what\nmanner thee acquired so great and witty powers.\"\n\n\"I gathered them not of mine own strength,\" said Milton, \"but they were\nmine for the asking and endeavour, and any man may obtain them in like\nfashion. I ceased not, nor will cease, in devout prayer to the Holy\nSpirit, that can enrich with all utterance and knowledge, and send out\nhis Seraphim with the hallowed fire of His altar, to touch and purify\nthe lips of whom He pleases. To this must be added select reading, and\nsteady observation, and insight into all seemly and generous acts and\naffairs.... And now, good Tom, to reading.\"\n\nElwood took up the Latin author which he was at present engaged upon,\nand proceeded with it. Whenever the preternaturally acute ear of Milton\ndetected, by Elwood's intonation, that he did not quite understand a\nsentence, he would stop him, examine him, and elucidate the difficult\npassage. By and by, \"You will find a saying very similar to that,\" he\nobserved, \"in Virgil his Fourth Eclogue. Fetch down the book, and let us\nhear what the Mantuan hath written therein.\"\n\nElwood searched along the bookshelves, but to no avail. \"Friend,\" said\nhe, \"thy Virgil is no longer here. Yesterday I handled it myself,--to-day\nit is vanished. So is the Lucretius.\" A frown contracted Milton's\nsplendid brow. \"These women-kind,\" he muttered like rumbling thunder,\n\"they are verily the root of all evil. Bid me hither my wife and\ndaughters, and Mary Fisher the maid moreover.\" The first and the last,\nbeing summoned, arrived in all haste, and disavowed any knowledge of the\nmissing books. Anne and Mary Milton, it appeared, were gone out\nmarketing: but little Deborah, being strictly cross-examined, confessed\nthat she had seen sister Anne carrying books away from the study last\nnight when their father had retired: the wherewithal for \"marketing\"\nwas easily obtained in this way.\n\nMilton groaned in his ineptitude. \"How have I deserved this treacherous\ndealing at their hands? Lord, how long shall I be\n\n              dark in light exposed\n    To daily fraud, contempt, abuse, and wrong,\n    Within doors and without, still as a fool\n    In power of others, never in my own?\n\n                          (_Samson Agonistes_).\n\n\nHere, by a happy coincidence, there was a sturdy hammering heard at the\nfront door, and Andrew Marvell was ushered in, \"I am out of my due\ntime,\" said he, \"for it is not yet gone six,\"--(six to eight P.M. being\nMilton's best time for receiving visitors). \"Yet to so old an offender\nas myself, John, I know thou wilt make an exception.\" Marvell was the\none friend of his own type and standing, the one constant and\ninalienable comrade, upon whose fidelity the blind man could rely. He had\nformerly been Milton's colleague under the Cromwellian Government: and\nwas his kindred spirit, so far as anyone could claim such relationship\nwith the frozen heights of the poet's intellect.\n\nWith him, during the next two hours--the learned physician Paget joining\nthem, and Elwood listening in respectful silence to the converse of these\nmighty men--Milton forgot the vexations of his ill-assorted household. He\nassured his friends that he was truly far happier now, in poverty,\ninfirmity and neglect, occupied solely upon his long-projected\nmasterpiece, than during the eighteen years of his manly prime, when his\nmind and pen were solely employed upon the controversies which he now\nprofessed to hate. \"Never again,\" he declared, \"shall earthly ambitions\ninterrupt and thwart me: never now shall I endure to leave a calm and\npleasing solitariness, fed with cheerful and confident thoughts, to\nembark in a tumbled sea of noises and hoarse disputes. Cast out of my\nfool's Paradise of fame not worth the finding, shall, not I and the hope\nwhereunto I am wedded explore some fair and fragrant tract of outer\nEden? Even as I have set forth the banishment of our first parents:\n\n    Some natural tears they dropped, but wiped them soon;\n    The world was all before them, where to choose\n    Their place of rest, and Providence their guide.\n    They, hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow,\n    Through Eden took their solitary way.\n\n                                       (_Paradise Lost_).\n\n\nI and my espoused hope indeed do tread through Eden.\"\n\nThe four men now, at eight o'clock, went down to supper: a very spare and\nfrugal meal, so far as Milton was concerned: for all he consumed was a\nlittle light wine, a piece of bread and a few olives. His flow of speech\nwas still unwearied, his spirits as near vivacity as they could approach\nit, when his friends rose to take leave. \"The night is yet young,\" said\nPaget, \"but I know that nowadays you seek rest early.\" \"That is so,\"\nMilton assented, \"since I am no longer able to study o' nights, and\nsince the best of secretaries,\"--he smiled towards Elwood--\"must needs\ngrow weary of a blind man's whims, I were as well in bed as out of it.\nMoreover, I can compose my lines to better advantage lying down.\"\n\n\"One thing, at least, you are spared,\" Marvell told him, \"darkness\ncannot discommode your doings, nor doth the eye-weariness of the\nmidnight student afflict you with grievous brow-aches in the morning as\nof old.\"\n\nMilton answered, \"My darkness hitherto, by the singular kindness of God,\namid rest and studies, and the voices and greetings of friends, has been\nmuch easier to bear than that deathly one. What should prevent me from\nresting in the belief that eyesight lies not in eyes alone, but enough\nfor all purposes in God's leading and providence? And to you now I bid\nfarewell, with a mind not less brave and steadfast than if I were\nLynceus himself for keenness of sight.\"\n\nIn a short space of time he was at rest in his darkened room; not as yet\ndrowsy, but revolving great phrases, and deriving a greater joy from\nthese lonely silences of the night-watches than could ever accrue to him\nby day. Gradually the aisles and bowers of the Paradise which his mental\neyes enjoyed took upon them more and more the lovely similitude of rural\nEngland. The greennesses and sweetnesses of his childhood's home, the\nBuckinghamshire village, were fused into the \"eternal spring\" of the\nprimeval garden. And from the \"glassy, cool, translucent wave\" of the\nriver that ran through Eden,\n\n    \"by the rushy-fringed bank\n     Where grows the willow and the osier dank,\"\n\narose \"Sabrina, attended by water-nymphs\" as once he saw her rise in\n_Comus_, and sang the sightless bard to sleep with the plashing of\nwater-music.\n\n\n    _Printed by Percy Lund, Humphries & Co., Ltd._\n    _Bradford and London._\n\n                                          _10322_\n\n\n                       ====================\n\nSome illustration's captions have been moved out of the paragraph.\n\nThe following captions have been added:\n  Illustration: Colour plate of book cover;\n  Illustration: Byron portrait plate;\n  Illustration: Paradise lost plate;\n  Illustration: \"Angel\" plate;\n  Illustration: Comus colour plate;\n  Illustration: Satan in paradise colour plate;\n  Illustration: Il Penseroso colour plate;\n  Illustration: \"Rose\".\n\nThe following noted Illustration was removed:\n  Dropped Cap \"A\" at start of text - \"About ...\"\n\nSpelling has been made consistent throughout.",
