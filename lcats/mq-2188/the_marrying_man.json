    "body": "It wasn't that Pete Cooper didn't love his wives, or that he wanted to\nsee them hurry on into the next world. He always felt real grief when\nhe found himself a widower.\n\nBut a man must be practical. They were all healthy young women, or at\nleast middle aged when he married them, good insurance risks, and no\ninsurance agent was turning down the business when Pete asked for a\npolicy that big, especially when Pete was putting the cash on the line\nto pay up the policy when he bought it.\n\nThat was the most sensible way for a man in the interstellar service\nto invest his money, Pete said. When he was out in space traveling at\nnear light speed, and time slowed almost to a stop for him, the few\nmonths he spent on an expedition meant that nine years passed for a\nwife on Earth for a Centauri trip, and Sirius meant fifteen, and Altair\ntwenty-five. So a man only saw his wife two or three times between\ntrips, and maybe the last time he saw her he had to take her to the\nold ladies' home, and the next time he pulled into Earth the insurance\ncompany was waiting for him with a check. Safer than stocks, and there\nwas always the possibility that the loving wife might come to an\naccidental end, which would sadden him, but it meant a double indemnity\npayment. That sort of satisfied a man's natural desire to have a little\nspeculation attached to his investment.\n\nSally was the seventh. Pete sat fingering the check, feeling genuine\nsadness at his bereavement.\n\n\"Lovely girl,\" he told the insurance agent. \"It makes a man feel empty\nto come home from the stars and find that his wife has gone to her\nreward.\"\n\nThe insurance man disguised a cynical smirk behind his sympathetic\nmask. \"Yes ... a wonderful woman. But it must happen to all of us.\"\n\nHe patted Pete's shoulder gently. Pete rose, folded the check\ncarelessly and put it into a pocket. He shook the insurance agent's\nhand.\n\n\"You've been very kind. I'll take your card ... in case I ever need\nanother policy....\"\n\n\n\nPete expected to need another policy before he left for his next trip.\nHe felt unhappy about Sally's being gone, but a man mustn't give in to\nmorbid self pity. And hadn't he heard somebody say that a man without a\nwife was like a spaceship without a motor?\n\nHe strolled about the city, unimpressed by the changes since his last\nvisit. An interstellar man with as much service as Pete was beyond\nshowing surprise at superficial differences. He was a little annoyed\nto find that the moving sidewalks were old-fashioned and had been torn\nout. People now wore little repulsor units on their belts.\n\nWalking was tiresome. He stopped at a corner and watched the\npedestrians as they whizzed by a few inches off the ground. At least\nthey were clothed; the nudity of the previous century had been somewhat\nunnerving even to the blas\u221a\u00a9 eyes of a time man. And he was glad to see\nthat the women were back to wearing long, well groomed hair. That\nperiod when fashion had called for smoothly shaven heads hadn't suited\nhis taste at all.\n\nIn fact, none of it seemed to appeal to him very much any more. That\nwas sophistication, the price that must be paid by a man in the\ninterstellar service, watching the centuries go by without belonging to\nany one of them. He watched a group of young people flit laughing by,\nfelt an unreasoning irritation. They'd be gone and forgotten when he'd\nmade a few more trips.\n\nOne of the young girls noticed him. She broke from the group and\napproached.\n\n\"You're an interstellar, aren't you? I hope you'll join me. I'm\nNancy....\"\n\nPete straightened up and looked her over. A little young, maybe\nnineteen, but that meant a lower premium. Nice blond hair, big waves of\nit that stayed in place even when she was moving fast, and even when\nshe was standing still she seemed to be moving. She was really alive,\nsmiling and laughing and talking easily, and in a pleasant low voice.\nReally healthy--that slender but nicely rounded body was good for a\nhundred years.\n\nBut then, money isn't everything.\n\n\"A lovely name,\" he told her. \"I like girls with old-fashioned\nnames....\"\n\nNancy, it seemed, wanted to interview a time man in connection with a\nthesis, and in this particular age there was no taboo against a young\ngirl introducing herself to a strange man. Pete didn't mind at all\nbeing interviewed and having dinner with her and seeing the town with\nher. And even when he had given her enough material for a dozen theses,\nshe didn't seem in any hurry to break off their friendship.\n\n\n\nPete was spending half his waking hours with Nancy and the other\nhalf in the men's beauty parlor. Not that he was old--a little\nprematurely gray and somewhat wrinkled from the hard sun of space\nand the unkind atmospheres of alien planets. And he had his contact\nlenses changed--paper was scarce in this era and they were using finer\nprint to stretch the supply. But he was still young. He studied the\nfull length mirror and decided he'd pass for thirty-five. His actual\nage--that would be hard to guess. Someday he'd look into the company\nrecords and figure it out. But mentally, he told himself, I'm a young\nman, even though I walked through this city five hundred years ago.\n\nA young man in love.\n\nThey knew in this era how to make it nice for young people in love, if\nyou could afford one of the better places. Pete sat across the table\nfrom Nancy at a tiny table on a roof far above the city. The room was\ncrowded, but some trick of design made it seem that they were alone\ntogether. There was real music played by real people. Some of the\nmelodies were old ones that brought a mood of nostalgia to the time\nman, with memories of past loves. But then he looked across at Nancy,\nwith her innocent laughing eyes, and the beauty of her brought a lump\nto his throat that drove out all the small loves of the past. This was\nit. This time he was really in love.\n\n\"Pete,\" she said, \"don't you ever get tired of it? Of jumping through\nthe ages, coming back to find your old friends gone, being a stranger\nin a strange world? For instance, how about me? You'll be back from\nSirius or Altair some day, a year or two older, and I'll be an old\nwoman? How does it really feel?\"\n\nPete took her hands and stared earnestly into her eyes. She was more\nserious than he'd ever seen her as she gazed back at him.\n\n\"It's not the right way to live, Nancy. A man doesn't really live, in\nthe real meaning of life. A man needs a woman, a wife he can come home\nto.\" He squeezed her hands gently. \"Nancy, will you marry me?\"\n\nHer hands trembled in his grasp.\n\n\"I will, Pete--oh, Pete, I've been so hoping--and so afraid. But, Pete,\nyour job...?\"\n\nHe smiled reassuringly.\n\n\"I'm signed up for a trip, but it's only a short one--that planet of\nProxima Centauri they just discovered is on the list for a complete\nsurvey. But I'll be back in--seven, eight years. Then we can really\nsettle down.\"\n\nShe bent over the table and kissed him.\n\n\"I'll wait, Pete.\"\n\n\"No, Nancy. Now. We'll be married first; I'll still be here a couple of\nmonths, why waste them? I don't want to take any chances of losing you.\"\n\n\"I wanted to hear that, Pete.\" Her eyes were shining with happiness.\n\"About getting married now, I mean--there's no chance of your losing\nme.\"\n\nPete was serious about settling down after the short trip to Proxima.\nAt least he was serious about it now. But after that trip was over....\n\nHe didn't think about that sort of thing any more. He had tried to\npuzzle it out a few times, how he could tell a girl he was making one\nmore trip, and mean it, and then one more and then one more until a\nhappy young girl was suddenly a disillusioned embittered old woman.\nThere was a paradox of conscience here that he had given up trying to\nresolve. When he said he was making one more trip, he meant it. But at\nthe same time he knew that when he came back he'd sign up for another.\nIf he meant what he said when he said it, even though he knew he'd\nchange his mind later--\n\nHis conscience was clear.\n\nAnd of course a man must be practical. His earnings must be invested,\nand the future provided for. The honeymoon was still new when the\ninsurance agent responded to Pete's call.\n\n\"I've always believed in insurance,\" he told Nancy. \"Of course,\nno amount of money could console me if I came back and found that\nsomething had happened to you. But people must prepare for the\nunpleasant things in life.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Nancy, who never disagreed with her husband. \"We have\nto be sensible about things. I might have an accident, and so might\nyou. We have to face things like that.\"\n\nThe insurance man was a little dazed. He'd never sold a policy nearly\nas big as the amount Pete had named.\n\n\"Nobody's had an accident on an interstellar ship in hundreds\nof years,\" he assured Nancy. \"The rate for your husband will be\nnegligible--we expect him to be around for a real long time. Now, sir,\"\nhe told Pete, \"your best buy is our family special--the full value to\nbe paid to the survivor. As I said, the cost for you is trivial, and\nfor your wife....\"\n\nHe thumbed his rate book nervously. Pete wrote a check to pay the\npolicy in full, and the insurance man walked out in a trance, spending\nhis commission.\n\nAnd Nancy hadn't noticed that Pete's signature had gone on a guarantee\nthat he wouldn't resign from the interstellar service for at least two\nhundred years, objective Earth time.\n\n\n\nPete felt a little sad when his leave began to run out. They sat around\nevenings adoring each other, not too late, because Pete was a man who\nneeded plenty of sleep or he felt irritable the next day. Nancy never\ntook his bad days seriously. The laughing happiness of youth was still\nin her eyes, but there was a firmness behind it now, the maturity of a\ngirl who knows how to become a woman.\n\nHe went down to the spaceport a few times to look over the ship he was\nsigned up for, and took the routine physical. Doctors went over his\nmind and his body, probing with needles and tubes and questions that\nwere pointless.\n\n\"What do you think of the popular songs of today, Mr. Cooper?\"\n\n\"What do you remember of your mother, Mr. Cooper?\"\n\n\"Are you interested in girls, Mr. Cooper?\"\n\n\"Do you have a close friendship with any of the other men in the crew,\nMr. Cooper...?\"\n\nThe routine this time seemed worse than ever. Actually he'd had worse\nones, when the medical fashions of the time called for it, but somehow\nit seemed more annoying this time.\n\n\"Five hundred years,\" he told the doctor. \"Five hundred years I've been\nliving this life and I know more about it than you ever will. Captain\nDrago told me on the trip to Altair--no, Sirius it was, that I was the\nmost devoted man in the service. Pete, he said, when you're aboard,\nI never worry about the engines, I'd rather have you sitting on them\nthan anybody else. That's the way he talked--sitting on the engines, he\ncalled it....\"\n\nThe doctor watched Pete thoughtfully and made notes on the paper before\nhim. And the next day the mail brought the message that Peter Cooper,\nMaster Engineman First Class, was retired from the service. There was a\npersonal letter of congratulations from an undersecretary, and a notice\nthat his pension would start the first of the following month.\n\n\"It's a mistake!\" Pete told his wife angrily. \"Something's wrong! They\ndidn't talk to Captain Drago like I told them, and--\"\n\nNancy's eyes were indignant. She sent him steaming back with fire in\nhis eyes, but he couldn't change the decision. He did get as far as\nthe office of the doctor who had asked him all the fool questions, and\nhe saw a paper he wasn't meant to see. It stunned him into temporary\nsilence.\n\nBut it wasn't true! Positively not!\n\nDefinite signs of senility, the notes read. Irritable reaction to\nquestioning. Mind wanders, fixes on irrelevancies. Preoccupation with\ncasual remarks of associates....\n\nAnd more. He didn't tell Nancy this, nor did he show her the reply he\nreceived to his protest.\n\n\"While a search of our records indicates a subjective--chronological\nage of approximately 48.6 years, physiological analysis puts the\ncondition of your body at a much higher figure--it would be guesswork\nto try to name a figure. However, recent studies indicate that\ninterstellar personnel with long terms of service tend to age at an\nincreasingly rapid rate, due probably to psychological factors stemming\nfrom the knowledge of separation from the natal culture....\n\n\"We are sorry....\"\n\nHe kept his hair dark and the wrinkles smoothed out and forced the\ntiredness from his bones. Other things were harder to fake, but Nancy\nwasn't a demanding wife. She thought he was about thirty-five, and she\nthought the blow of being dropped from the service had taken the life\nfrom him. She took his part firmly.\n\n\"It's nothing to be ashamed of, Pete. Not one person in a thousand\ncould pass the examination for the interstellar service--they're really\ntough. And we're together.\"\n\n\"What will we live on?\" Pete demanded, knowing he was being too\nirritable, but unable to control it. He waved the pension check. \"Can\nwe live on that? A fine payment for my years of service.\"\n\nNancy looked dubiously at the check. \"I thought it was a lot ... but\ndon't worry, Pete. You have a wife to stand by you.\"\n\n\n\nWhen Pete found out how his wife had gone about standing by him, he was\nalmost shocked speechless. Almost.\n\n\"You signed up as my replacement on the Proxima expedition! But you\ncan't! It's no job for a woman! And you're leaving me alone--for seven\nor eight years! They won't take you!\"\n\n\"They already did.\" She smiled bravely at him. \"As the wife of a\nretired serviceman I had preference. We need the extra money, Pete. And\nit won't be for long. When I come back, we'll still be young enough to\nenjoy life, darling. And they pay well--a few years of sacrifice now\nwill make so much difference in our future....\"\n\nPete closed his eyes and thought of how many times he had said the same\nwords to starry eyed young women. It won't be long ... we'll still be\nyoung ... good pay....\n\nHer loving lips tenderly brushed his dark hair.\n\n\n\nOn nice days, Pete sits in a rocking chair on the porch with the other\nold men. He doesn't bother to dye his hair any more and he reads now\nwith a thick glass, complaining about the small type they use nowadays.\nThe attendants laugh off his irritability, and some of the visitors who\ncome to see the other old men don't mind listening to his stories about\nthe interstellar service.\n\nWhen it gets toward dusk, he looks into the sky sometimes as the\nstars appear. Centaurus isn't really there, not here in the northern\nhemisphere, but he looks anyway. Out there in space, his wife is doing\na man's job. Wonderful woman, Elsie.\n\nNot Elsie--Nancy. How could he have made that mistake. Nancy, a\nlaughing young girl who had grown swiftly into a strong mature woman\ndefending her man and her marriage vows.\n\nHe leans back and rocks faster then, a smile on his face. Sometimes the\nvisitors see him and shake their heads sympathetically, and sometimes\nhe sees them doing it, but it doesn't matter. They don't know. They\ndon't know about his nest egg, that insurance policy he's going to\ncollect some day now, because he's going to straighten them out down at\nthe interstellar bureau. Captain Drago will straighten them out, and\nthen he's going back into space and support his wife as a man should.\n\nAnd sometimes the smile fades and a tear rolls down his cheeks when\nhe thinks of Nancy growing old and passing away and the insurance man\ngiving him a check and a few words of sympathy. But a man has to be\npractical about such things.",
