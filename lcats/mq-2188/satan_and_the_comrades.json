    "body": "Nick felt almost good-humoredly buoyant after his year's holiday as a\ncollege boy. About a second after leaving Earth he slowed his\ntraveling speed down to the medium velocity of light by shifting from\nfifth dimension to fourth. Though still a million miles above the\nwastes of Chaos and twice that distance from the gates of Hell, his\nX-ray eyes were quick to discern a difference in the road far below\nhim.\n\nSin and Death had built that broad highway eons before. On leaving\nHell, presumedly forever to carry on their work among men, they had\ndone a mighty good job of the original construction. But time had\nworked its ravages with the primrose-lined path, and it was not\nsurprising that on starting his sabbatical leave, Nick had ordered his\nchief engineer to repair the road as a first step in his plan to\nmodernize Hell.\n\nApparently, old Mulciber had done a bang-up job, and Nick roared in\nlaughter at evidences of the engineer's genius and those of wily\nBelial, the handsome court wag. The Propaganda Chief had added\nadvertising at numerous new roadhouses along the way, and unwary\nshades traveling hellward gazed at beautiful scenes of lush vegetation\ninstead of a dreary expanse like the Texas Panhandle. This \"devilish\ncantraip sleight\" also changed the raw Chaos climate to a steady 72 deg.F\nand gave off a balmy fragrance of fruits and flowers.\n\nTen thousand drachmas, a fictitious unit of currency established by\nfoxy old Mammon, was the flat fee for use of the road. Blissfully\nunaware of this \"Transportation Charge,\" or how it would be paid,\nnumerous phantom pilgrims were sliding down the steeper hills--and\nhaving a swell time. Their shouts of glee reached Nick's largish ears\ndespite the lack of air as mortals know it. Clever old Mulcie had\ninstalled freezing plants here and there to surface the road with\nglare ice.\n\nNick poised above a party of phantom men and girls sliding downhill on\ntheir _derrieres_ and ending in a heap at the bottom. A nice change\nfrom traveling under their own power. Their maximum speed while swift\nand incomprehensible to mortals, seemed relatively slow to one of\nHell's old timers. Only Nick and his best scout, Cletus, could move at\nthought speed--\"Click-Click Transportation.\"\n\nDrifting on, a pleased smile on his red, bony face, Nick paused\nseveral times to read Belial's welcomings.\n\n\"Die and see the original Naples in all its natural beauty,\" said one\nsign. \"Try our hot sulphur springs and become a new soul.\" Gayest\npleasures were promised to all and golfers had special attention.\n\"Register with the pro at your favorite golf club so you can qualify.\nNo charge for pro's services who'll teach you to break 80. Free lunch\nand drinks at all Nineteenth Holes.\"\n\nNo fool shade would wonder what he'd qualify for, nor suspect he'd\nhave to shovel eighty million tons of coal and ashes before his\nhandicap would be lowered enough to earn him a set of golf clubs or\nthat the free lunch and drinks were chunks of brimstone, the\nsulphurous air and Styx River water which is always just below boiling\npoint at 3,000 deg.F.\n\nHell's thousand of new golf courses, gambling joints and bars would be\navailable only after downtrodden souls had worked a millennia or two\nat common labor jobs. A shady deal, indeed, but all a part of Nick's\nmaster plan to get him and his legions back to Heaven.\n\nBy modernizing Hades he hoped to annoy \"The Big Boss Upstairs\" while\ndiverting the attention of those two vigilant celestial watchers,\nMichael and Raphael, from the main idea. In a series of bold moves,\nknown only to Nick and his Board or Inner Council, mankind would be\nwiped off the earth--and thus bring The BBU to time. Or so Nick hoped.\n\nAs a first step, he had spent a year as Pudzy, a college boy, studying\nelectronics and modern skills of all kinds. He had enjoyed the holiday\non Earth though it irked him to recall that he'd been obliged to do\ngood here and there. The thought of these satanic lapses caused him to\nfrown, but his jolly mood returned when he saw the familiar gates of\nHell wide open in obedience to his whistle.\n\nThe whistle's high frequency waves also awakened Cerberus, the\nthree-headed watch dog, besides actuating \"The Dingus.\" This\nelectronic device Nick had stolen to operate the three ponderous\ntriple-fold gates of adamantine, brass and iron.\n\nHe slowed to supersonic speed, brought back his great red wings and\nmade a neat three-point landing without injuring the needle-sharp dart\nat the end of his long, black tail. Still feeling jovial, he kicked\nall three of Cerberus's heads, then zoomed down through the tunnel to\nthe north bank of the River Styx.\n\nThere he halted to view the ten-lane suspension bridge Mulciber had\nthrown across the steamy black water. Nick was wondering how the old\ngenius had accomplished such a feat when a thick black wall dropped\nacross the bridgehead.\n\n\"Cost you five thousand rubles to cross, mister,\" Charon called in a\nthick voice.\n\nThe old riverman who had ferried new shades across the earth-hell\nboundary for eons of time, had just returned after a year's vacation\nin Moscow.\n\nHe hid a bottle under his brimstone bench, then straightened a gaudy\nred tie as he weaved forward. A changed devil, Charon. His year in\nRedland had done more than put him into a natty summer suit. Although\nnot very bright, he had unusual powers of observation. He liked to ape\nthe odd speech of his customers, especially American prospectors.\nThese truculent but harmless old timers worked at odd jobs around the\nnearby palace grounds, and in the ferryman they found a kindred\nspirit.\n\nNick eyed the loyal old fellow's red tie with amazement. \"What, for\nSt. Pete's sake, are you drinking, Char?\"\n\n\"Vodka,\" Charon gasped. Recognizing the stern voice, he tried to focus\nhis bleary eyes. \"'Scuse it, Your Majesty. I've come a long way and\nalone. Your substitute, Pudzy, gimme a bottle 'fore he returned to\nAmeriky, and it's durn cold up there in Musk-Cow, and so I took a few\nnips, and I felt so goldurned glad to git back I polished off what was\nleft, so I didn't recognize Your Majesty when you came zoomin' along,\nand if you'll sort of overlook--\"\n\nNick patted the frightened old fellow's scrawny shoulder. \"Better\ncheck in and sleep it off, Char.\"\n\n\"Gosh, stoppin' _you_!\"\n\n\"You let everybody in till I tell you different. Forget the toll\ncharge too, you old conniver.\"\n\n\"Yeah, and look!\" Chortling with glee, Charon tottered back to his\nstation and put one hand across the beam of a photo-electric eye. The\nponderous gate slid silently upward. \"It weighs fifteen hundred tons,\nMulcie says, and I don't even push a button.\"\n\n\"You still smell like a Communist, Char,\" Nick said, sniffing the good\nsulphurous air. \"How come you're on the job as bridgekeeper if you've\njust returned from Moscow?\"\n\n\"Orders from Beelzebub, and it's nigh a half hour by now since this\nfella came across the bridge. I'm sauntering home, friends with\neverybody, I am--\"\n\n\"What fellow?\"\n\nCharon scratched his grisly thatch. \"Come to think of it, I never see\n'im afore this. I'm standing back there, looking down at my old skiff\nand wondering about my job, when this fella comes up. 'This is for\nyou, Charon,' he says, and held out your official incombusterible\nletterhead with the cross-bones and dripping blood--\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah. What does this stranger look like? What's his name? Who\nsigned the paper?\"\n\n\"Beelzebub signed it. I guess I know the John Henry of your Number Two\ndevil even if I am a dumb ferryman.\" Perhaps sensing he had blundered,\nCharon almost wept. \"This paper appoints me head bridge-tender from\nnow to the _end_ of eternity, and, bein' worried about my job, I\nhopped right to it. You're the first--\"\n\n\"Which way did he go? What's he look like?\"\n\nCharon almost said \"Thataway,\" as he shook his head and pointed a\ntrembling finger to the distant shore. \"Lemme see. He wore neat\nclothes about like mine, and he zoomed off like the upper crust shades\ndo when in a hurry--which ain't often. He has mean little eyes, sort\nof pale blue, is built wide and short, and talks American good as I\ndo. Now't I think of it, he had an impederiment in his speech, and he\nsmelt like a bed of sweet peas.\"\n\n\"Very good, indeed.\" Scanning the paper, Nick smiled as he recognized\na forgery of the Beelzebub signature. He drew out his pen which writes\nunder fire as well as water, and scribbled \"Nick,\" then put the\ndocument into the eager hands. \"This gives you the job forever--or\ntill I revoke the appointment.\"\n\n\"Boydy-dumb-deals!\" Charon shouted. \"Boss, you oughta hear about my\nadventures in Redland. I had a real gabfest with the new Premier,\nAndrei Broncov, and his Minister of Culture, Vichy Volonsky.\"\n\nNick grinned sardonically. \"I heard a little about the most recent\nchanges in the Kremlin. Are my old sidekicks well? And are they having\nany particular trouble since liquidating the old gang?\"\n\n\"How come you call that fat crumb, Broncov, your sidekick?\" Charon\nfrowned, trying to collect his wits in the dread presence. \"He didn't\nask about you. He took me for an illegitimate son of Joe Stalin's, so\nhow would he know you and I are pals? I bought this red tie and hired\na sleeping dictionary to catch onto the language better, and--\"\n\n\"Your dictionary probably spilled things to the MVD.\"\n\n\"Not while my gold held out. Anyhow, those punks are way overrated.\nTricky, maybe, and they lie good. They'd rather bump you off than eat\nbreakfast.\"\n\n\"Purge is the word. The old comrades Broncov threw out a month ago now\nfully understand its meaning. How is the comrade?\"\n\n\"Gosh, boss, I'm sick of hearing that word. They say it just before\nthey knife you. Broncov's been busy, all right. Since taking over the\nNumber One job he's been sending a lot of his best friends down this\nway. To keep Joe Stalin company, he told me. He looks fat even if Bill\nShakespeare says this new lot--\"\n\n\"I suppose he and his pals plied you with liquor,\" Nick said.\n\n\"They tried to drink me under the table.\" Charon cut a laugh in half.\n\"Gosh, I durn near forgot. Y'know what the sidewinder, Bronco, babbled\n'fore he passed out? Top drawer stuff. Only he and this Vichy\nVolonskyvich know about it. Seems Bronco learned, somehow, about your\ntaking a vacation, so he's been torturing a lot of his friends into\nconfessing they plotted agin 'im. He promised them an easy death if\nthey'd carry on down here. How you like that?\"\n\n\"The fools. What's his plan?\"\n\n\"I ain't sure I got it all as his tongue got thicker from the vodka.\nBut I learned Hell's full of comrades who've sworn to their god,\nLee-Nine, they'll toss you to the wolves. They aim to pull Joe Stalin\noff his clinker-picking job and make him secretary here.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" Nick urged in ominous tones. \"How?\"\n\n\"They've swiped some new secret weapon and figure to obliterate you\nand every devil in authority so things will be organized nice and cozy\nwhen they finally get here. The Dumb--\"\n\n\"Good report, Char.\" The new weapon did not bother Nick much, but from\nhis profound studies of atom smashing he decided anything can happen\nthese days even to a top devil. He continued briskly: \"Hereafter,\nsniff all your customers and make sure they don't _smell_ like a Red.\nYou know the aroma by now--sweet peas with an underlying stink--so\nkeep your nose peeled. When you spot a comrade, radio-phone the guard.\nThose lads will know what to do you can bet your last ruble.\"\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nThe rousing welcome home Nick received as he climbed the hill to his\ngreat palace would have warmed his heart if he'd owned one.\n\n\"Thanks, boys and girls,\" he intoned in his best golden voice. \"It's\nswell to be back among you. I haven't time for a speech now, but tune\nin to Channel Thirteen tomorrow evening for my fireside chat.\"\n\nHe wanted to take off for Moscow immediately, but decided to start the\nwar by calling The Board. Also, the boys would be hurt if he didn't\ninspect what they'd done during his absence. After a hasty,\nRussian-style dinner of caviar, cabbage and cold horse with a gold\nflagon of vodka, he ordered Azazel, Flag Bearer and Statistician\nChief, to call a meeting in the throne room.\n\nLittle Cletus waylaid his big boss. The scout among the celestials\nlooked like a chubby cherub what with his dimpled cheeks and curly\nblack hair, but he'd proved to be the trickiest imp south of the\npearly gates. Knowing that Raphael had cajoled the little imp into\nrevealing something of the improvements in Hades, Nick suspected\ntreachery by one of his most trusted scouts.\n\n\"I hear you've been seeing Raphael!\" he barked.\n\n\"Aw, I told 'im a pack of lies,\" Cletus scoffed. \"Maybe Rafe figured\nout something; he's a smart apple. I told 'im everybody here is hot\nand unhappy like you ordered me to say if they ever caught me. I said\nour air-conditioning system goes haywire and that we were ripping out\na thousand old boilers and coolers. Stuff like that.\"\n\n\"Don't lie to me, you ornery little brat. Okay to anybody else but not\nto me. I happened to hear Rafe talking to Mike, and they're wise to my\nplan of making Hell attractive.\"\n\n\"Well, hell,\" Cletus protested, \"they saw Mulcie's gangs fixing the\nroad. If Rafe and them extra-extrapopulated that dope to figure out\nthe truth, why blame me?\"\n\n\"We'll forget it,\" Nick said, vastly relieved to believe his scout had\nnot betrayed him. \"I have a job for you. I'm going to Moscow and I\nwant your help. Light out as soon as you can. Requisition as much gold\nas you can handle by the usual translation method, and include a sack\nof polished diamonds and rubies. I'll tell Mammon it's okay when I\narrange for my own supply.\"\n\n\"Okay, boss. Where do we meet? And what am I supposed to look like,\nand do?\"\n\n\"Make yourself bellhop size and register at the Droshky Hotel as\nPrince Navi from Baghdad with fifty Persian oil wells to sell. Let 'em\nsee your gold and jewels. And, remember, you'll account for any dough\nyou toss away to women and bribes. Get going!\"\n\nNick could see into the _near_ future, at least, and he chuckled after\nCletus vanished through the wall. \"The little devil doesn't know\nwhat's in store for him.\"\n\nIn the throne room, sage old Beelzebub sat at the right of His\nMajesty's chair; huge Moloch with his evil grin and snaggle teeth, at\nthe left. Tall, prissy Azazel, always acting important, planted\nSatan's flag and then sat down at a table opposite wide-shouldered\nMulciber and handsome Belial. Charter members all of the original\norganization booted out of Heaven some eighteen million years ago when\nNick's first but not last rebellion flopped.\n\nAfter the customary ritual of renewing their vow to get back to\nHeaven, the gang sat down. Nick rapped the arm of his throne and\nglared at Chemos, the lustful one.\n\n\"Cheme,\" he said, \"if you will quit flirting with Astarte, The Board\nwill take up business.\"\n\nBelial snickered when the culprits' red faces grew even redder, and\nafter a wink at the court wit, Nick went on: \"I intend to take off for\nMoscow after a quick look about with Mulcie and Belial. Incidentally,\nmy compliments on the good work you did on the road.\"\n\n\"Egad, boss,\" Moloch complained, \"why can't you stay home more and\nline things up for us?\"\n\n\"Time enough--\" Nick sniffed, scowled, then pointed toward a thick\npillar near the rear of the big room. \"I smell an interloper. Thammuz,\nDagon, drag 'im up here! Beel, I fancy he's the one who forged your\nsignature.\"\n\nBeelzebub rose in anger when a shadowy figure darted for the door. The\nintruder moved as fast as any wraith but the two former gods were too\nquick for him. A brief struggle, then they dragged the eavesdropper\nbefore the throne where they held him upside down.\n\n\"It's the Paperhanger!\" Beelzebub roared.\n\n\"I guessed that from Charon's description,\" Nick said calmly. \"He's\nsiding with the Reds again--Smell him? Stand up, Adolf, and hear your\nsentence!\"\n\n\"I didn't do a thing, Your Majesty,\" Hitler began, but the hot,\nglowing eyes were too much to face. His knees buckled and he sank,\ngroveling, on the floor. \"Didn't I send you millions of customers?\" he\nwailed. \"Haven't I done a good job of sweeping out and collecting\ngarbage? Have a heart, Nick. I came in here to sweep, and how would I\nknow about this private conference?\"\n\n\"You talk about hearts?\" Nick flared. \"You hung around to listen. You\nforged Beelzebub's signature on my official paper, then put Charon in\ncharge of the bridge, thinking he's too dumb to report any Commies\ncoming here.\"\n\n\"I can prove--\"\n\n\"You get the same chance at that which you gave people in Berlin. Down\nthe chute with him, boys!\"\n\nThe chute, connecting with a main one leading down to the burning\nlake, has a flap which Belial gleefully lifted. Since shades have no\nmass worth mentioning, the long duct acts like a department store\nvacuum tube.\n\n\"Oh, my beloved emperor, forgive me,\" Adolf yelled as he felt the\nsuction. \"I only wanted to organize a counter-revolution against the\nCommunists and--\"\n\n\"Ratting on your pals again, eh?\" Nick sneered. \"You stay in the\nburning lake a thousand earth years. You'll have plenty of time and\ncompany for your plotting. Let 'im rip!\"\n\n\"No! I'll be forgotten--\"\n\n\"No one remembers you now except as a dung heap.\" Nick turned a thumb\ndownward, and the screeching shade vanished.\n\n\"Like a paper towel in a gale,\" Belial said as he let the flap clang\nshut. \"How'd that creep get a job where he could snoop?\"\n\n\"My fault,\" Beelzebub admitted. \"He's a smooth talker. I saw him not\nlong after you left, Your Majesty, when I went out to inspect the\ngarbage incinerator. He had shaved off his dinky mustache and changed\nthe color of his eyes, but I recognized him.\"\n\n\"It's okay, Beel.\" Nick patted the heavy shoulder of his top\nassistant. \"The punk did us a left-handed favor in bringing things to\na head.\" He told of how Charon had discovered the Red plot, then\noutlined his general plan.\n\n\"Those Commies can't stand ridicule,\" Nick summed up. \"While I'm gone\nI want every Communist son tossed into the burning lake. Alarm all\nguards and tell them how to identify them--the fragrance of sweet peas\nwith an underlying stink. No one in the USSR has used up a cake of\nsoap in twenty years, and the perfume they add can't quite cover the\nBO.\"\n\n\"Must be a lot of Commies here,\" Mulciber commented. \"How many guards\nhave we, Azzy?\"\n\nAzazel, Statistics Chief, glanced at a roll of incombustible\nmicrofilm, and cleared his throat. He liked being called upon, and\nsince he had the history of every shade while on Earth, he was the\nsecond most feared devil in Hades.\n\n\"After promoting the last batch who qualified for better jobs during\nthe minimum millennium at common labor,\" Azazel said, \"and adding--\"\n\n\"Never mind the commercial!\" grouchy Moloch roared. \"Boss, how do we\nknow all our guards are to be trusted?\"\n\n\"We don't,\" Nick said. \"When did we ever trust anybody? But our system\nof checkers, checkers checking the checkers, super-checkers on up to\ncharter members, hasn't failed yet.\"\n\n\"If His Eminence, The Corpse-Snatcher, is satisfied,\" Azazel said,\nsmoothing his sleek black hair, \"I shall answer Prince Mulciber's\npolite question. We now have on the guards' roll exactly thirteen\nmillion four hundred--\"\n\n\"That's close enough.\" Plainly pleased with his title, Moloch grinned\nat the big engineer. \"Mulcie, why not build a chute straight up into\nMoscow? Save the boss trouble. He could take along a few gorillas and\ntoss all those troublemaking stinkers straight into a hot bath.\"\n\nNick joined in the laughter. \"Trouble with that, Molly, The BBU\nwouldn't stand for it. Only Death can give the final sting, and even\nhe has to wait for the call. Our game is to play it cagey, stick by\nthe few rules The BBU laid down, and stay out of trouble.\"\n\n\"How do you aim to handle those fellas?\" Belial asked.\n\n\"Tell you after I do it.\" Nick guessed the fun-loving Propaganda Chief\nwanted to go along, but decided Cletus would be a better assistant in\na plan already formulated. A boon companion, Belial, for any nefarious\nproject. True, he had the quickest wit of the lot, but had worked\nover-long in the advertising racket, and many of his schemes resembled\nthose of a hen on a hot griddle.\n\nNick turned to the secretary. \"If you have all this down, Asta, I'll\nconsider a motion to adjourn.\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nIt was an hour short of midnight and snowing in Moscow when Nick\nlanded in the printing room of Pravda, the official Red journal. As he\nhad calculated, several sample newspapers had been run off.\n\nVichy Volonsky, a short, roundheaded man, had held up the rest of the\nissue while he studied the content through his nose-glasses. Editor\nBlochensk and the mechanics anxiously awaited the great man's verdict.\nAn unfavorable one meant the concentration camp for everybody. As\nMinister of Culture, Volonsky previewed all news personally when not\nrunning errands for Andrei Broncov at a meeting of the Inner Council.\n\nThe Number Two ranking man in the Kremlin clique frowned most\nfrighteningly, then, moved by an odd compulsion, walked into a\nsound-insulated telephone room. He closed the door and stared at it\nstupidly while looking through the invisible Nick.\n\n\"Why did I come in here?\" he said. \"There's only the usual bilge in\nthe sheet, nothing to telephone the fat slob about. Yet something made\nme.\"\n\n\"I did,\" Nick said, suddenly visible. \"When I finish, Pravda will\nnever be the same again. Lie down, Vichy!\"\n\nVolonsky opened his mouth, but Nick wiggled a finger, and no yell came\nout. In the wink of an eye, he squeezed out the Minister's shade and\ntook its place.\n\n\"Pretty cramped and smelly quarters,\" Nick told himself, \"but do or\ndie for good old Hades.\"\n\n\"What? Who are you?\" Volonsky's phantom teeth chattered. \"You must be\nNick, himself.\"\n\n\"Russia's patron saint till you amateurs took over. I have business\nwith your boss. I mean Andrei Broncov. Not that it matters, but who\nconceived the idea of deposing Satan? Talk, _mujik_, and tell the\ntruth. All of it.\"\n\n\"Blame Broncov, not me,\" Volonsky pleaded. \"It was his scheme to kill\noff several thousand loyal party comrades. They got a choice: Be\ntortured to death, or die quickly and work for a revolution in Hell as\nsoon as they arrived. Naturally--\"\n\n\"I've heard enough, rat.\" Nick spat contemptuously, and a puff of gray\nsmoke spread rapidly over walls, ceiling and floor. \"That will hold\nyou,\" he jeered, and opened the door. Aping the Minister's important\nwaddle, he walked over to the great press.\n\nEditor Blochensk stared with fear-bulged eyes. \"Anything--anything\nwrong, Your Excellency comrade?\" he asked shakily.\n\n\"Nothing I can't fix.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" The editor clutched his throat. \"Thank--uh--uh--\"\n\n\"Never mind, I know Who you mean.\" Muttering words in Hell's silent\nlanguage, Nick walked completely around the press. \"It's perfect,\nBlochy. Don't let the content worry you. It's part of The PLAN. Roll\nout your papers and deliver them fast. Don't question anything. Orders\nfrom--you know.\"\n\nOnly minutes ahead of the new Volonsky, Cletus had entered the lobby\nof the Droshky Hotel on Red Square. The cherubic scout had obeyed\norders and made himself bellhop size, large size. He didn't exactly\nresemble the one in the cigarette ad but he had the kid's twinkle in\nhis dark eyes. And he had already latched onto a luscious blonde; or,\nmore likely, Nick concluded, the reverse.\n\nHaving just registered as a Persian prince, Cletus again clanked down\na large sack of gold pieces and a smaller one of jewels. \"Put these\ndiamonds and rubies into your best safe,\" he ordered in perfect\nRussian.\n\nThe clerk's eyes began popping, so did the blonde's and those of a\nscore of spectators, including four hard-faced MVD boys.\n\n\"And I'll take care of you, Honey-Navi,\" the blonde said.\n\n\"Ah, you just love me for my two billion dollars,\" the imp retorted,\nand winked at her. As did Nick, Cletus could plainly see the twist\noperated on the MVD payroll as well as in her own interests.\n\n\"I'm selling out my fifty oil wells,\" he announced, \"and I've come to\ntown to see the head man, whoever he is today. I thought I'd let you\ndumb _mujiks_ bid for the wells before I practically give them to\nSuper-San Oil company for a measly two hundred million dollars.\"\n\n\"Of course, Prince Navi,\" the clerk said loudly. He nodded toward the\nfour tough lads who, likewise, had not yet noticed the great Volonsky.\n\nNick rapped on the counter with his six-carat diamond ring. \"How about\na little service here, comrade?\"\n\n\"One moment, comrade,\" the clerk said nervously.\n\n\"What you mean, one moment?\" Nick roared. \"I haven't flown all the way\nfrom New York to have a two-bit clerk tell me to wait. I represent\nSuper-San Oil and I'm here to meet a Persian Prince Navi.\"\n\n\"Quiet, Amerikaner, till--Oh, Your Excellency Comrade Vychy Volonsky!\"\nThe mouth of the astonished clerk fell open. Then, fearful of making a\nwrong move in the Red game of dirty politics, he failed to guess why\nthe great one should act as a miserable capitalist. \"A thousand\npardons, Your Excellency Comrade. What can I do for the beloved\ncomrade? I didn't recognize you--\"\n\n\"Hush, fool!\" Nick looked toward Cletus just then gazing into the\nblonde's blue eyes.\n\nThe four MVD agents went into a quick huddle, then the one with a\nbroken nose bowed to the fake Volonsky. \"If Your Excellency Comrade\nwill step aside with us, we'll explain this fool's mistake.\"\n\n\"Put him in the can and question him tomorrow,\" Nick snarled. \"Anybody\ncan see he's working for the filthy capitalists.\"\n\n\"Of course, Your Excellency Comrade.\" Broken nose and his three pals\nescorted Nick to a chair beside a column. \"I'm Lieutenant Putov of the\nMVD,\" he whispered. \"We picked up this Prince Navi the instant he\nentered, and have been watching him.\"\n\n\"Skip the commercial,\" Nick said, almost laughing as he gave Moloch's\nfavorite expression. \"How come you didn't spot him at one of our\nairports?\"\n\n\"He must have landed on an abandoned field in his private plane, Your\nExcellency Comrade.\" Lieutenant Putov glanced at the other three\nequally worried looking plug-uglies. \"He's a prince, all right. Look\nat the gold and jewels he tossed to the clerk, several million dol--I\nmean, several billion rubles. We haven't checked his story, but he\nclaims he's here to sell fifty Persian oil wells.\"\n\n\"I know _that_, idiot. Our spies in Baghdad advised us yesterday.\nThat's why I pretend to be with the stinking Super-San--Wggh!\"\n\n\"What are Your Excellency Comrade's wishes?\"\n\n\"Get him away from that blonde before she ruins our plans.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's Nishka, one of us.\" Astonishment widened Putov's watery\nblue eyes. \"Have you forgotten the night you and she drank--\"\n\n\"You talk too much, Putov.\" Nick flapped a hand. \"Get a car to take me\nand the prince to the Kremlin. Hurry it! Comrade Andrei Broncov and I\nhave a Council meeting at midnight. You three, bring the prince to me\nhere.\"\n\nCletus and Nishka had withdrawn to a sofa in an alcove off the lobby.\nWithout effort, Nick could see them and hear the female agent saying:\n\"How do I know you have all that money, Navi-Honey? I'll bet you\nbrought gilt lead and fake jewels just to impress me.\"\n\n\"No, but I've been to America,\" Cletus bragged, knowing well his boss\nwould be listening. \"So be nice and I'll prove they're real. I've been\neverywhere but this lousy place. I even lived in Egypt.\"\n\n\"Talk some Egyptian for me,\" Nishka wheedled.\n\n\"I've forgotten most of it,\" Cletus said, cannily dodging the trap.\n\"But I once made a study of the ancient language.\" He ripped out a\nstream of what had once been his native tongue. Then, partly at least\nto test Nishka's knowledge, he added in English, \"How's for looking at\nmy room before we go out on the town?\"\n\n\"Wha-at? Why, you bad boy!\" The girl winked at her three fellow agents\ncoming toward them in a crablike walk, then spoke in Cletus' ear:\n\"It's the LAW, Navi-Honey, but don't let them worry you. Little Nishka\nwill stay with you--to the limit.\"\n\nCletus leered at her and rose to accompany the MVD to the front of the\nlobby. He and Nick put on an act, then went to the street followed by\na chattering crowd.\n\nOnce inside the sleek car Putov had conjured up, Nick said: \"The heap\nis wired so we'll talk only in Hell language.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nIt wasn't far to the grim walls of the Kremlin, and as the big car\npurred across the snowy, radio-stricken square, Nick gave Cletus the\nmain points of his plan. Obviously warned, the police gave a snappy\nsalute and let the car enter the courtyard. A few moments later,\nHell's emissaries were zooming through long corridors and up to the\nsecond floor; walking the last fifty yards.\n\nSix husky guards armed with sub-machine guns opened the great doors to\nthe Premier's private study. \"He's been asking for you,\" a huge guard\nwhispered.\n\n\"He would, the brainless pup,\" Nick snarled, reading the big fellow's\nthoughts. A Volonsky man called Gorkzy. \"Don't announce us.\"\n\nInside the great room, at a desk almost large enough for a roller\nskating rink, Andrei Broncov appeared to be studying a document. True\nexecutive, he went on reading till Nick coughed.\n\n\"Your Excellency Comrade Broncov, I have brought Prince Navi. Where is\nthe rest of the Council?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Broncov's plump face widened in a smile for Cletus. \"This is an\nhonor, Your Highness. I trust you will pardon my preoccupation with\naffairs of state. They're in a mess--as are all capitals when the old\norder departs. I supposed you'd be announced.\" Andrei Broncov glared\nat the pseudo Volonsky and whispered in a dialect, \"The Council is\nwaiting below, fool.\"\n\n\"Nuts,\" Cletus said. \"Talk English, will you? I can hardly understand\nyour outlandish language. Or, speak Persian.\"\n\n\"My knowledge of your native tongue is not good, but I'm quite at home\nin English or Amerikaner. A Russian invented--\"\n\n\"Yeah, he knows,\" Nick cut in. \"Forget the malarkey, Bronco. This lad\nis here on business and has no time for our phoney hooptedo. From his\ngrandfather, the old Shah, he inherited fifty of the richest oil wells\nin Asia, and he's giving us a chance to bid on them instead of\ncarrying on a, quote, cold, unquote, war, and steal--\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Broncov said through his big teeth. His lips tightened\nin his rage over Volonsky's direct speech, but he managed to say\nfairly suavely: \"Your Highness, we appreciate your giving us a chance\nto buy your wells. Surely, a banquet is in order.\"\n\n\"No, I want to get out of this place. It's too cold.\"\n\nNick peered over his Volonsky nose-glasses. \"How much, kid? No\nfooling.\"\n\n\"Volonsky!\" Broncov barked. \"Mind your speech. I'll handle this little\ndeal. You're excused.\"\n\n\"Uh-uh.\" Nick grinned. \"I stay for _my_ cut.\"\n\n\"You both look like a couple of crooks to me,\" said the young prince.\n\"I want two hundred million dollars--in gold.\"\n\nBroncov's hand shook as he reached for a row of buttons. \"How about a\nbit of tea and cakes, or, perhaps something stronger before we discuss\nthis matter with the Council? They're waiting just below us, and I'd\nlike to present the deal already consummated.\"\n\n\"Got any Old Style Lager around?\" Cletus asked.\n\n\"We have some good Bavarian beer, a stock we--ah--bought some time\nago.\"\n\n\"I've heard how much you paid the Heinies. The beer I want is made in\nWisconsin, USA, so I think I'll fly over there tonight. Super-San Oil\nkeeps begging me to visit their country. Offered me two hundred\nmillion for my wells but only half in gold. I want all gold, and I\nwon't discuss any other terms.\"\n\n\"Bungler!\" Broncov whispered in dialect. \"Why didn't you get him\ndrunk, first? Without oil we can't carry on this cold war or kid the\npeasants much longer. Where in hell could we get even two hundred\ndollars in gold?\"\n\n\"Go to hell and find all you want,\" Nick said with a wicked grin.\n\n\"I understood what you high-binders said,\" Cletus put in. \"My cousin\ntold me before I left home Communist clucks don't savvy Saturday from\nSunday. Everybody knows you top boys have stolen everything not nailed\ndown, and have stashed it away against the time your own people kick\nout Communism for good.\"\n\n\"Oh, come, Prince Navi, I don't understand how such an evil story\nstarted. Our people wouldn't dare--\"\n\n\"Wouldn't they?\" Cletus laughed nastily. \"We have spies too, and we\nknow your common herd would settle for anything else. Most of them\nwant their church and their Tsar back, bad as he was.\"\n\n\"Bah! The capitalist press started that myth.\"\n\n\"Why, Bronco,\" Nick protested, \"you can read that story in Pravda,\n'The Organ of Truth.'\" The fake Minister of Culture cleared his throat\nto keep from laughing when the glowering Premier began thinking of\nvarious ways to torture unsympathetic comrades. In silent Hell\nlanguage, Nick added: \"Good work, Cleet. I'll take it from here.\"\n\n\"Lies put out by the war mongerers of Wall Street,\" Broncov shouted.\nHe continued raving, but Nick no longer listened.\n\nSounds outside the window told him time had begun pressing. He shook\nthe hat he'd been carrying. \"Gold, is it you want, Prince Navi? You\nthink we have none? How about this?\"\n\nA glittering gold piece tinkled on the floor and rolled toward the\namazed Red Premier. Puffing, he bent over and scooped up a newly\nminted coin the size of the American gold eagle. \"It's a new\nissue--I--never mind. We have lots more where this came from, haven't\nwe, comrade Vychy?\"\n\n\"I'll say,\" Nick said. \"Watch!\"\n\nGold pieces continued falling from the hat, one by one, then in a\nsteady stream. Stunned, Broncov clutched his throat, muttering: \"It\ncan't be true. Miracles don't happen.\"\n\nHe watched in silence while his Minister of Culture made a pile of\ngold coins four feet high. When the floor timbers began creaking, Nick\nmade another similar heap; then, others, till the thick walls began\nbulging inward.\n\n\"Stop!\" Broncov cried. \"A couple of tons is enough.\" Eyes now popping,\nhe waved his arms as the floor sagged under fifty times that weight.\n\"There's the two hundred million for you, Prince. The rest is for--us.\nWe'll sign the papers in another room.\"\n\nIgnoring frightened cries, Nick made more piles of gold next to the\nwindows. Outside on Red Square, people were running in all directions,\nshouting and waving newspapers. A cannon roared. A hundred or more\nmachine guns began rattling. Plainly, the bullets were not fired at\nany one, for the people were laughing and weeping, singing and\ndancing.\n\n\"Come here and have a look, Bronco,\" Nick suggested.\n\n\"It's--a trick, a revolution,\" Broncov panted. \"Damn you, Volonsky,\nyou started it.\" He snatched a heavy revolver from his desk and fired\nit at Nick without warning.\n\nThe false Volonsky laughed when five of the slugs bounced off the\ninvisible shield around him. A sixth bullet splintered the window\nglass. The other five returned and struck the raging Red boss, cutting\nhis face and arms enough to bring streams of blood. He dashed for the\ndoor but collided with the six guards who burst into the room.\n\nBroncov wiped off some of the blood running into his eyes well enough\nto see all six waving copies of Pravda. \"What's going on here?\" he\nscreamed.\n\n\"Read about it in Pravda,\" bellowed Gorkzy, the huge guard. \"It always\nprints the truth--you've taught us.\"\n\n\"What truth?\" quavered the Premier. \"Put down those guns!\"\n\n\"Oh, no. Pravda says you were shot trying to escape, and for once it\nreally told the truth.\" Implacably, the big guard brought up his\nTommy-gun and let it rattle.\n\nThe stricken Red leader took two steps backward and fell to the floor\nas the other five guns opened up on him in a hell's chatter of death.\nHis falling weight added the last straw to the overstrained floor\ntimbers. They gave way in a roar, and a hundred tons of yellow gold\nstreamed downward in a cataclysmic wave of wealth and death to the\nCouncil members below.\n\n\n\nPoised on air, Nick and Cletus became invisible to mortal eyes. \"That\nwraps it, Cleet. Let's see how the boys take it.\"\n\nThe six guards were peering down into the ruin below, and at some of\nthe fortune still clinging to the slanting floor.\n\n\"Great Nicholas!\" Gorkzy yelled. \"Gold!\"\n\n\"Just like Pravda says,\" howled another man. \"Listen! It says:\n'Volonsky and the mysterious Persian prince have disappeared. Broncov\nexecuted by heroic guards. All members of the once-feared Inner\nCouncil crushed almost beyond recognition when floor crashed upon them\nfrom the weight of the gold brought by the prince.'\"\n\n\"And look at this!\" roared the big Gorkzy. \"'All soldiers and police\nthrow down their arms. Refuse to shoot the people shouting they want\ntheir Tsar and church back. Satellite countries freed of the odious\nCommunist yoke. Concentration camps, collective farming, and slave\nlabor abolished. All spies and saboteurs recalled to Moscow for trial\nand punishment. Ivan, the Tsar, to issue proclamation.'\"\n\n\"What Tsar?\" The six stared stupidly at one another.\n\nOne man picked up a shiny gold piece and tested it with his teeth.\n\"The Bolsheviks murdered the old goat and all his family. How can this\nbe?\"\n\n\"He probably left plenty of bastards,\" another man hazarded.\n\n\"I get it,\" Gorkzy shouted. \"Prince Navi is a grandson. His name is\nN-a-v-i--Ivan spelled backward. Why, the smart little devil! And now\nhe's here some place to reign over us.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Cletus protested as he and Nick slithered through the wall.\n\"You aren't going to make me rule over these dopes, boss. Have a\nheart. It's cold here, and the whole country stinks.\"\n\n\"That's your punishment, m'lad, for letting Raphael and Michael catch\nonto you. You can't prowl around Heaven just now so you'll have to\nwork here in Hell's Rear Annex for a while. Look!\" Nick thumbed one of\nthe gold pieces. \"Your image stamped on all of them. Also 'Ivan--Tsar.\nIn God We Trust.'\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Cletus said, shuffling a little, then brightening. \"Anyhow,\nI'll have Nishka.\"\n\n\"Not if the common folks find out she worked for the MVD.\" As if to\npunctuate Nick's prophesy, a dozen bombs exploded inside police\nheadquarters.\n\n\"Heck!\" Cletus shrugged resignedly. \"Well, lend me that hat, and\nconjure up a couple million tons of soap--not perfumed.\"\n\nRoaring with laughter, Nick promised to spread soap over the entire\ncountry, then watched the little imp zooming back and forth across Red\nSquare--sprinkling the snowy pavement with Ivan-Tsar pieces of gold.\n\n\n\nThe Satanic laughter lasted till Nick had whizzed half way across\nChaos. \"That caper,\" he told himself gleefully, \"will fool The BBU\nabout my plan. Or, will it? Great Hades! I did a _good_ deed.\"\n\nA million miles above the wastes of Chaos, he remembered he still wore\nVolonsky whose shade would still be imprisoned in the Pravda room.\nNick shucked out of his unpleasant quarters, halted to watch the thing\nspinning downward.\n\n\"Cheer up, Vych,\" he laughed. \"Next century I'll gather up what's left\nand give it back to you--maybe.\"",
