L. S.\" These\nlines are certainly a concise statement of the spirit in which her\nson undertook to expound the benefits to be derived from \"performing\nour petty round of irritating concerns and duties with laughter and\nkind faces.\" Before he could walk steadily, it had been discovered\nhe was heavily handicapped by the burden of ill-health. Still the\ngood fairy who came to his christening endowed him with \"sweet\ncontent,\" a gift which carried him triumphantly through all\nhampering difficulties. He never faltered in the task he set\nhimself--the task of happiness. He began to preach his gospel as a\nchild. He would not have his tawdry toy sword disparaged even by his\nfather. \"I tell you,\" he said, \"the sword is of gold, the sheath of\nsilver, and the boy who has it is quite contented.\" In the same\nmanner he transformed a coddling shawl into a wrap fit for a soldier\non a night march. To the end of his days he was eager to be happy.\nWe are told\n\n    \"Two men looked out from prison bars;\n     One saw mud, the other stars.\"\n\nWhen bodily ailments held Stevenson as a captive in bonds, his keen\nsight pierced through the obstructions which held him caged. We are\nnot left in doubt, when we read his books, as to whether his gaze\nwas earthwards or to heaven's distant lamps. He taught others to see\nwith his clear vision, and he expounded his gospel in so taking a\nmanner, even if the import of it had savoured more of mud than\nstars, it would have been studied for its style. He had the true\nartist soul within him. He wished to create or represent what came\nwithin the range of those brilliant dark eyes of his, so, with\ninfinite care and effort, he strove to attune his words to the even\ncadence and harmony with which he wished to amaze us, for, as A.J.\nBalfour said, \"he was a man of the finest and most delicate\nimagination, a style which, for grace and suppleness, for its power\nof being at once turned to any purpose which the author desired, has\nseldom been matched.\" It is difficult for those who knew him before\nhe had, by pure hard work, won his way to fame, to realise how one\nphysically so fragile, of so light-somely versatile and whimsical a\nnature, apparently so ready to be diverted from the main high-road\nby a desire to explore any brambly lane, had in him the deliberate\ngoal-winning gait of the tortoise. His stubborn tenacity of purpose\nhe owed to his antecedents. The Scot's inalienable prerogative of\npedigree exercised an influence over him, though he appeared as a\nforeign ingraft upon his Scotch family tree. In his record of his\nfather's kinsfolk, A Family of Engineers, and in many of his essays,\nhe engages his readers' attention by confiding to them his own and\nhis forebears' history. \"I am a rogue at egotism myself; and to be\nplain, I have rarely or never liked any man who was not,\" he says.\n\nThis Benjamin of Edinburgh's literary sons, the youngest, not the\nleast, was born in the very middle of last century, 1850. This babe,\nthat was to do Edinburgh honour yet, had been named after his two\ngrandfathers, Robert Lewis. He was a mixture of both, the inevitable\nresult of their diverse qualities, which he inherited. The Robert (a\nname he was seldom known by in his youth) was from the Stevenson\nside. They were a race of men of sterling metal, who lit our\nNorthern Lights, and from the besieging sea wrung footholds for\nharbours. From them Robert Louis Stevenson inherited that tenacity\nof purpose which made him write and rewrite chapters till his\nphrases concisely expressed his meaning, and toilsomely labour till\nhis work was perfected. His minister grandfather he etched with the\n\"Old Manse.\" All his mother's people, the Balfours, were of a\nsanguine, hopeful strain, retaining an elasticity of spirit which\nnever lessened under the burden of years. Stevenson writes of \"that\nwise youth, my uncle,\" who was a grey-bearded doctor when his nephew\nthus referred to him. So from the daughter of the Herd of Men at\nColinton he inherited his perennial youthfulness. \"He was ever the\nspirit of boyhood,\" says Barrie, \"tugging at the skirts of this old\nworld, and compelling it to come back and play.\"\n\nIt was well for the boy that his mother had gifted him with her\nhopeful nature, for his father had Celtic traits in his character,\nand was oppressed with a morbid sense of his own unworthiness. It is\nCarlyle who vouches for the fact \"that wondrous is the strength of\ncheerfulness, altogether past calculation its power of endurance.\"\nLittle store of bodily vigour had Robert Lewis; but with his\nbuoyant, enthusiastic, inquisitive spirit he accomplished a strong\nman's task, \"weaving his garlands when his mood was gay, mocking his\nsorrows with a solemn jest.\" This treasured only son, worshipped by\nhis doting parents and his nurse, Alison Cunningham, who was a\nsecond mother to him, reports himself to have been a good child. He\nalso says he had a covenanting childhood. In the mid-Victorian era,\na stricter discipline reigned over nurseries in Scotland's capital\nthan now. \"The serviceable pause\" in the week's work on Sunday was\nnot without real benefits, for the children of these times, if\nsermons were long and the Sabbath devoid of toys, learned to sit\nstill and to endure, and very useful lessons they were to R. L. S.\nand others. Despite being an extra model little soul, \"eminently\nreligious,\" he says, he was much like other children. His nurse\ntells how, during one of the many feverish, wakeful nights he\nsuffered from, when he lay wearying for the carts coming (a sign to\nhim of morning), she read to him for hours at his request the Bible.\nHe fell asleep, soothed by her kind voice, to awake when the sun was\nbright on the window pane. Again he commanded, \"Read to me, Cummie.\"\n\"And what chapter would my laddie like?\" she asked. \"Why, it's\ndaylight now,\" he answered; \"I'm not afraid any longer; put away the\nBible, and go on with Ballantyne's story.\"\n\n\"I am one of the few people in the world who do not forget their own\nlives,\" he boasted. His Garden of Verses testifies to the truth of\nthis statement. When he was a man over thirty, he bridged the gulf\nof years, and wrote of the golden days of childhood. Not only do the\nlittle people joy to hear his piping, but those who sit in the\nelders' seat hearken to these happy songs of merry cheer coming to\nthem as echoes from the well-nigh forgotten past. His father often\nsat by his sick-bed, and beguiled his small son from fears and pains\nby tales \"of ship-wreck on outlying iron skerries' pitiless\nbreakers, and great sea-lights, clothed in language apt, droll and\nemphatic.\" His mother and Cummie read to him day and night. Thus\nearly the instinct of authorship was fired within him.\n\nOne evening the young Stevenson realised that the printed page was\nintelligible to him. It was as if a rock that barred his entrance\ninto the cave of treasure had melted, or swung back at his command.\nTill then Louis had been keen, like other youngsters, on adopting\nmany professions when he grew up. Soldiering, even in the Crimean\nWar time, did not appeal to the girlishly gentle little chap, for,\nas he shrewdly remarked, he neither wanted to kill anybody nor be\nkilled himself. When he learned to read, he saw before him all the\nrows of books which he was told had finer stirring stories in them\nthan even those his father told him, and he resolved he, too, would\nbe a maker of tales.\n\nThose wide apart but penetrating eyes of his had caught sight of an\nideal guiding star to follow, viz., Literature. His juvenile\nambition to be a \"Leerie licht the lamp\" faded. To reach the gleam\nwhich had enamoured him, he knew he must build with care and\npatience, like his family of engineers, a tower to enclose or a\nladder to reach to this will-o'-the-wisp which inveigled him upward.\nHis mind teemed with ideas; but he saw he would have to serve an\napprenticeship to learn to weave smoothly together the web of his\nfancy, till, in his verbal fabric, he had the charm of all the muses\nflowering in a single word.\n\nHe describes to us how he became a skilled artificer with his pen,\nand how with obstinate persistence he taught himself daintiness of\ndiction. In his first book of travels he mentions how the branch of\na tree caught him, and the flooded Oise bereft him of his canoe. \"On\nmy tomb, if ever I have one,\" he wrote, \"I mean to get these words\ninscribed, HE CLUNG TO HIS PADDLE.\" The paddle he chose was his pen.\nIt was the motive power which forwarded him along the river of life,\nthrough shoals and rapids. When but a wee toddling bairn, he drew\nhis nurse aside and commanded her to write, as he had a story to\ntell. He dictated to his mother, too, when a boy of six, an essay on\nMoses. As a housebound child, he had to amuse himself. Skelt's\ndramas were then his delight; but the life of every child is a\nprophecy for those who know how to interpret it. His mother was\nprescient, and fore-told her white-faced Louis had the light of\ngenius in those windows of the soul--the eyes. \"Talent,\" she knew,\n\"was the result of human labor and culture.\" He dreamed, when but\nfour, he \"heard the noise of pens writing.\" She took it and his\nchildish \"Songstries\" he sung as an earnest of his future.\n\nLouis' father, despite being, like Dr. John Brown's Rab, \"fu' o'\nseriousness,\" had odd whims, among others, an objection to schools\nand lessons, so he raised no objection to his son's regulation\nschool-days being intermittent. When barely in his teens, Stevenson\nwas ordered South, and spent two winters abroad. He was a pupil at\nEdinburgh Academy for a few years. Andrew Lang was there at the same\ntime; but, he explains, the future Tusitala,--\"the lover of\nchildren, the teller of tales, giver of counsel, and dreams, a\nwonder, a world's delight,\"--and he did not meet there, for Louis\nwas \"but a little whey-faced urchin, the despicable member of some\nlower class,\" when his future brother author was \"an elderly boy of\nseventeen.\" The pity was that the cosseted only son never rubbed\nagainst his compatriot children in the discipline of the play-fields,\nbut in some of his summer holidays he tasted of the doubtful\npleasures of lantern-bearing and other boyish \"glories of\nexistence.\"\n\nWhen the lad was seventeen, his parents leased Swanston Cottage,\nwhich became their summer home, and a big factor in their boy's\neducation. It is a spot peculiarly secluded, to be within sight and\nsound of Edinburgh, lying hidden in the lap of the hills, sheltered\n\"frae nirly nippin' Eas'lan' breeze and haar o' seas.\" It was there\nStevenson began deliberately to educate himself to become the Master\nStylist--the \"Virgil of prose\" of his contemporaries. These\nPentlands were to him always the hills of home. He lifted his eyes\nto them from the old manse of Colinton, when he played there in his\ngrandfather's garden. He longingly, in gaps between the tall, grey\nhouses, looked for their familiar outline when winter prisoned him\nin Auld Reekie.\n\nThese pastoral hills, with their sweeps of heathy moorlands, appear\nfrom first to last in his works. Two of his initial Memories and\nPortraits depict his hill-folk neighbors, the Shepherd and the\nGardener. It was at a church \"atween the muckle Pentland's knees\"\nthat Archie Weir of Hermiston noted young Kirsty, and that same\n\"little cruciform place\" was the scene of his \"PETIT POEME EN\nPROSE,\" where we can all spend a peaceful \"Lowden Sabbath morning\"\nwith his \"living Scotch\" sounding in our ears. However far away\nLouis Stevenson roved, there was mirrored on the tablets of his\nmemory his own country, its speech, its very atmosphere. He wrote a\nNew Arabian Nights, but from the old (he tells us how his minister\ngrandfather envied him his first reading thereof) he had acquired\nthe secret of the magic carpet, and could be transported at will\nfrom the tropics back to where the curlews and the plovers wailed\nand swooped above the whins and the heather on his hills of sheep.\n\n\n\n\nSTEVENSON'S APPRENTICESHIP\n\n\nIn his early days, Louis was sociable, pleased when he met\ncompatriot children, ready to be dressed and go to parties. But\nafter he left school, his mood changed. He had been completely\nsheltered from rebuffs, so, when he stood in the \"palace porch of\nlife,\" and the peculiar accents of his mind were jeered at, he, who\nhad never tasted of a whipping, felt the smart of humankind, and\nsuffered sorely from \"maladies incident to only sons.\" In the\n\"coiled perplexities of youth\" he \"sorrowed, sobbed, and feared\"\nalone. Blackford's uncultured breast had been meet nurse for Sir\nWalter when he roamed a truant boy, but further south of the\nbecastled capital, topmost Allermuir or steep Caerketton became the\ncradle of the next poet and master of Romance that Edinburgh reared.\nThere, in woody folds of the hills, he found, as he said, \"bright is\nthe ring of words,\" and there he taught himself to be the right man\nto ring them. When Swanston became the Stevensons' summer home, the\nundisciplined Robert kicked with his fullest vigour against what he\ncalled the Bastille of Civilisation and the bowing down before \"the\nbestial Goddesses, Comfort and Respectability.\" He was loudly\nrebellious, and too impatient to follow the ordinary rules of life\nor the sage advice, \"Jowk and let the jaw gae by.\"\n\nAn impression has arisen, because of his revolt in these years\nagainst convention and creeds, that he was thwarted and\nunappreciated in his home and its surroundings. On the contrary, he\nwas at liberty to indulge his Bohemian tastes and do much as he\nlisted. His father gave him a seemingly inadequate allowance. Yet\nThomas Stevenson was not a miserly man. He begged his son to go to\nhis tailor's, for he disapproved of the youth's scuffy, mounte-bankish\nappearance. He supplied him with an allowance for travel--in\nfact, R. L. S. had all his bills paid, and his own study in a very\nhospitable home. R, L. S. owned books, and jewels were the only\nthings he felt tempted to buy. The 1 pound a month allowance, when\nhe left school, raised soon after to 82 pounds a year, was to keep\nthe money from dropping out of that hole in the pocket of his ragged\njacket, which never seemed to get sewed up. Books he had in plenty,\nbut his parents naturally did not treat him to strings of flashing\nstones to wear over his shabby velvet coat, or twine round his\nbattered straw hat. His money affairs, like the table of Weir of\nHermiston, were likely all his life \"just mismanaged.\" By the time\nhe settled in Samoa, his literary earnings were thousands a year;\nand by then his quiet-living, hard-working father was dead, leaving\nan ample fortune. Still he seemed haunted by fear of lack of means.\n\nLouis' love and admiration for his father was deep and sincere. At\nhis home, when guests gathered round the engineer's table, the boy,\nwith his eyes sparkling, listened to his father's \"strange, humorous\nvein of talk,\" then glanced round with a smile of expectation to see\nhow much others appreciated their host's well-told tales. \"My father\nwas always my dearest,\" he wrote. This was a high certificate of\nappreciation, when we remember he had the most devoted of mothers.\nIt hurt the son to the quick to deal his \"dearest\" a staggering\nblow, and decline to follow his hereditary profession. Louis had\ntried to be an engineer. He liked the swinging, smoking seas on\nwhich they struggled for a site for sheltering masonry. As in the\ncase of other Stevensons, the romance of the work was welcome to\nhim, but the office stool frightened him. When the would-be author\nhad refused to follow in his kinsmen's footsteps, he promised to\nstudy as an advocate to satisfy his father, who urged his son to\nfollow a recognised profession. Owing to his easy-going schooling\nand lack of a settled course of study, the law classes were\nexcellent training for the erratic, mercurial-notioned youth.\nStevenson had the good fortune in 1869 to be elected a member of the\nSpeculative, the famed Debating Society where Jeffrey first met\nScott. There Stevenson encountered his contemporaries in years and\nsocial standing, his superiors in debate, and he, \"the lean, ugly,\nidle, unpopular student,\" as he calls himself, enjoyed \"its\natmosphere of good-fellowship, its vivid and varied interests, its\ntraditions of honourable labour and success.\" \"Speculative\nevenings,\" says R. L. S., \"form pretty salient milestones on our\nintellectual journey.\" He had gripped a deal of the foundations of\nhis hereditary trade when seemingly but a consistent idler. He\nmastered the intricacies of law, and took to the abhorred office\nstool so as to learn the better the workings of its slow machinery.\nHe tells us he only obtained the mastery of his pen by toiling\nfaithfully, but inborn in him was the art of talking. Even as a\npetti-coated child, we read he gesticulated to aid his glib tongue.\nW. E. Henley (whose acquaintance Louis made about 1875, and who\nhelped Stevenson with his chary praise and frank criticism) says of\nhis friend, \"He radiates talk. He will discourse with you of morals,\nmusic, marbles, men, manners, meta-physics, medicine, mangold-wurzel,\nwith equal insight into essentials and equal pregnancy and\nfelicity of utterance.\"\n\nAlong with this ready affluence of speech, the youth had what good\ntalkers often lack, viz., the patience to hearken to others.\nStevenson shone best in what he called a little committee of\ntalkers, though his father and he used to argue a question together\nfor days; but, in the Speculative, he had at first to be a listener.\nA candid fellow-member says, \"I cannot remember that Stevenson was\never anything as a speaker. He was nervous and ineffective, and had\nno power of debate; but his papers were successful.\" In one of his\nessays, touching on this select assemblage, Louis sketches what the\neditor of the History of the Speculative Society, just published,\ncalls \"a little Dutch picture; it focuses in vivid colour the\nassociations which rise in the memory at the name of the Spec.--the\nstately old room aglow with many candles, the books, the portraits,\nthe pious commemoration of the dead,--famous men and our fathers\nthat begat us.\" \"Stevenson,\" Mr Dickson goes on to say, \"is the most\nfamous man of letters who has belonged to the Society since Scott.\nNo more interesting personality has ever been of our number, and no\none has in the public eye been more closely identified with the\nSociety.\" \"Oh, I do think the Spec, is about the best thing in\nEdinburgh,\" Louis exclaims, and twice he was President of the\n\"worshipful society.\"\n\nA contemporary of Stevenson's, Sheriff Guthrie, wrote in 1899, \"I\nknew Louis first in the Speculative Society; second, as a fellow\nstudent in the University Law Classes; third, being called to the\nScottish Bar about the same time as a brother-in-law; and last, as a\nfriend with many interests in common. In the Speculative he spoke\nfrequently, and read some papers. We recognised his brilliancy, and\nwe delighted in his vivacity; but we misread the horoscope of his\nfuture. We voted him a light horseman, lacking two essentials for\nsuccess--diligence and health. We wondered where he had got the\ndeftness and rhythm of his style, not knowing that the labour out of\nwhich it was evoked was of itself sufficient to refute our estimate\nof his powers of work. As to his health, we forgot behind that\nslender, angular frame was not only a father's iron constitution and\na mother's nervous vitality, but his own cheerful spirit and\nindomitable will.\" The Sheriff, in this letter to me, recalls\nseveral reminiscences of Stevenson-some in a playful or contrariwise\nvein, and another memory illustrates, he says, \"the sweet\nreasonableness which mingled with his wayward Bohemianism\"; but\nspace does not allow me to quote more than how, \"It seems but\nyesterday that I met Louis in the Parliament House, and said I heard\nhe had got a case. And I seem to see the twinkle in his eye and the\ntoss of his arms as he answered, 'Yes, my boy, you'll see how I'll\nstick in, now that I've tasted blood.'\"\n\nLouis' mother showed this friend, Mr. Guthrie, a succession of her\nboy's photographs, ending in wig and gown as an advocate. \"That is\nwhat I call from Baby to Bar,\" she said; and then added, beginning\nwith a smile, and ending with a break in her voice, \"I said to Louis\nonce that the next collection would be from Bar to Baronet, and he\nreplied, 'It will be from Bar to Burial.'\" Except at the \"dear old\nSpec.,\" he mixed little his equals in Edinburgh. As a writer in\nBlackwood points out, at the period he had grown into swallow-tails,\nEdinburgh was by no means devoid of intellectual company, which even\na famed Robert Louis need not have despised. But he abhorred\nconstraint and codes of rules. He was a born adventurer and\npractical experimentist in life, and he explains he spent much of\nhis time scraping acquaintance with all classes of men and\nwomenkind. His insatiable curiosity made him thirst to taste of the\nbitter as well as the sweet, to be pricked by the thorn as well as\nsmell the rose. He was quick to see the humorous side of a tale or\nepisode, but he was tenderly sensitive to ridicule. When he appeared\namong his legal brothers-in-law in the Parliament House, a wit there\namong the unemployed advocates in the old hall called him the Gifted\nBoy. He winced under the laugh, and fled from \"the interminable\npatter of legal feet.\" He had cultivated notoriety by his shabby\ndress and lank locks. He did not realise, as an American says, \"If\nyou look as if you had slept in your clothes most men will jump to\nthe conclusion that you have, and you will never get to know them\nwell enough to explain that your head is so full of noble thoughts\nthat you haven't time to bother with the dandruff on your\nshoulders.\" In a corridor in the Parliament House, where the men\ncalled to the Bar keep open-mouthed boxes for documents to be\nslipped in, one bore on its plate the inscription R. L. Stevenson.\nWhen that alien-looking advocate with unsuspected gifts had cast off\nthe wig and gown, and had busied himself for years filling up reams\nof paper with his thoughts and studies on people, places, and\nthings, sightseers going through the Courts would be shown this\nunused box, which remained so empty while those around it of his old\nrivals at the Spec, were full, as they were scaling the heights\nwhich lead to titles and the Bench.\n\nStevenson wrote of Edinburgh and her climate in a carping spirit,\nnevertheless he accorded due praise to her unsurpassed beauty. \"No\nplace so brands a man,\" he declared; and, in his turn, Stevenson\nleft his brand on the romantic city of his birth, for now no book on\nScotland's capital is written without mention of the haunts and\nhomes of that changeling-looking son of hers. The door-plate of 17\nHeriot Row bore the inscription of R. L. Stevenson, Advocate. No\nblue-bag laden clerk dropped briefs then into its letter-box. In one\nof its sun-facing drawing-room windows there stood a big Australian\nvine, carefully tended and trained. It was behind it, in the far\nwindow, the eighteen-year-old lad sat when, in the winter's\ngloamin', Mrs. Fleeming Jenkin, calling on his mother, was startled\nby his voice joining in the conversation. The visitor says, \"I\nlistened in perplexity and amasement. Who was this son who talked\nas Charles Lamb wrote? this young Heine with the Scotch accent? When\nI came away the unseen converser came down with me to the front door\nto let me out. As he opened it, the light of the gas lamp outside\n('For we are very lucky with a lamp before the door,' he says) fell\non him, and I saw a slender, brown, long-haired lad, with great dark\neyes, a brilliant smile, and a gentle, deprecating bend of the head.\nI asked him to come and see us. He said, 'Shall I come to-morrow?'\"\nHe called next day, for Louis grasped at anything or any person that\nhe felt drawn to. He took part in their theatricals, but otherwise\neschewed social functions in Edinburgh. An old friend of his\nfather's asked him to come to fill a gap at his table, though his\nown son had informed him Louis never went to prearranged feasts.\nLouis himself replied to this invitation: \"C. is textually correct,\nonly there are exceptions everywhere to prove the rule. I do not\nhate dining at your house. At seven, on Wednesday, his temples\nwreathed with some appropriate garland, you will behold the victim\ncome smiling to the altar.\" The last words are characteristic of his\nattitude when he was lured into society,--he went a willing victim,\nwith no affectation of martyrdom. The few who met him in Edinburgh\ndrawing-rooms found him prodigal of tongue, somewhat puzzling with\nhis wholesale enthusiasms, absurd flights of fancy, theories he had\nto propound, and ever ready to change like a chameleon to tone with\nhis surroundings. The spritish, fantastic youth impressed those he\nencountered, even when he was one of the unfledged eaglets hatched\nin the ancient eyrie of his precipitous city, whom Browning tells us\nare not counted \"till there is a rush of wings, and lo! they are\nflown,\" \"What was so taking in him, and how is one to analyse that\ndazzling surface of pleasantry, that changeful, shining humour, wit,\nwisdom, recklessness, beneath which beat the most kind and tolerant\nof hearts?\" asks Andrew Lang. But not only through the magnetism of\nhis personal presence did he attract even strangers, but through his\npen has he held in thrall all the reading public who liked his work.\n\"He has put into his books a great deal of all that went to the\nmaking of his life,\" wrote his cousin, \"though he had the art of\nconfiding a good deal, but not telling everything.\" It would have\nbeen interesting to see, if Stevenson had taken it into his elfin-locked\nhead to learn to shine in debate, and, instead of incubating\na budding Scott, as he said, \"the Spec.\" had trained an able\nadvocate, if the glamour of his personality would have extended to\nthe judges, and made him, with his well-chosen words, a successful\npleader. The boards of the Parliament House were too well worn a\nroad for so tramp-blooded a man. The tune \"Over the Hills and Far\nAway\" was for ever humming in his head. He left the venerable city\nof his birth, which he vowed he must always think of as home, and\nsteered a course on his way to fame \"far ayont the muckle sea\" which\nled him from the Bar to Burial.\n\n\n\n\nACROSS THE SEAS\n\n\nAs an advocate, Stevenson found ample time to pursue his chosen\nprofession of letters, for, during the winters in Edinburgh, he\nwrote much, and gradually his essays, etc., appeared in magazines,\nand are now gathered into happily named volumes. He spent the long\nvacations, when the Courts had risen, abroad, mostly frequenting an\nartist-colony in Fontainebleau. At that time he was full of a\nproject, in company with some congenial spirits, to form a\nperipatetic club, buy a barge, and glide leisurely through Europe by\ncalm waterways. He had gone yachting one summer with a sea-loving\nbrother advocate up the west coast of Scotland. The memory of that\ntrip inhabited his mind, and he made his hero, David Balfour, when\n\"Kidnapped\" sail by the self-same islands and seas. Louis was\npersuaded by his boating friend, the following season, to embark\nwith him on a canoe trip through Belgium; and the log of that tour\nbecame immortalised as An Inland Voyage, Stevenson's first book. His\ntravels did not end when he left his frail craft at Pontoise, for,\nreturning to Gretz, on the skirts of Fontainebleau, he first met his\nfuture wife, and that led a few years later to his following her to\nSan Francisco, when she was free to remarry.\n\nHe crossed the Atlantic and America as an Emigrant. That mode of\nlife proved too hard for him. He had sailed and paddled without hurt\nin his fleet and footless beast of burden, the Arethusa. In the\nensuing year (1877), he travelled \"Through the Cevennes with a\nDonkey,\" slept under starry skies, or camped in plumping rain. Often\nat home he buckled on his knapsack and tramped along the open road,\nbut in these trips, as in his two longer outdoor journeys, he had\nthe heavens above him. The Emigrant was crowded with his fellows, so\nLouis arrived sick and sorry on the other side of the Atlantic,\nwhere he had to support himself, having left his home against his\nfather's wishes. The rising author found his market value in America\nlow-priced, and his curiosity as to how it felt to be ill and\npenniless was satisfied. After his marriage in 1880, Louis, his\nwife, and her son became \"Silverado Squatters,\" which proved a\nhappier venture, both for purse and constitution, than being an\n\"Amateur Emmigrant\"; also, Mr Stevenson generously settled an income\non his son.\n\nIn a perpetual pursuit of health, the writer and his hostages to\nfortune rambled from the snows of Switzerland to the vineyards of\nFrance, and finally settled for three years at Bournemouth.\nStevenson's undermined health grew worse; but he laboured on at his\nwork, from his sick bed. Some summers he spent in Scotland, and at\nBraemar wrote Treasure Island: then Jekyll and Hyde brought him\nnotoriety. He was anxious to return to his Alma Mater, and be there\na Professor of History. A house in the cup-like dell of Colinton,\nwhere every twig had a chorister, would have sheltered him from the\npurgatorial climate; and the College, like the Courts, allowed long\nvacations, spring and summer, to journey off to bask in the South.\nBut this plan, like the barge one, came to naught, for he was not\nelected. The tales of tropic islands in the South Seas--\"beautiful\nplaces green for ever, perfect climate, perfect shapes of men and\nwomen with red flowers in their hair and nothing to do but study\noratory and etiquette, sit in the sun and pick up the fruits as they\nfall,\"--remained in his tenacious memory. A guest at his father's in\n1874 spoke of them, and the young Stevenson had stored the\ndescription away in his mind, to be unearthed when he willed, as was\nhis habit. When first he heard of those favored spots, he had two\nanchors which kept him bound to Edinburgh--his parents. The good\nengineer died in 1887; and the other anchor, his mother, he found\ncould be lifted, and became the best of ballast. When he elected to\nbecome a world wanderer, she left her Edinburgh home and, without\nhesitation, went off with her son and his household when they turned\ntheir backs on Europe in 1887. Her journal to her sister tells of\nthese travels \"From Saranac to Marquesas.\" She simply but racily\ndescribes their course, which ended in the cruise on the Casco. In\nher book we enjoy genuine glimpses of the author, not so much as the\nman who has written himself into fame, but her happy-tempered,\nhero-hearted, eager-minded boy, who for forty-five years was all the\nworld to her. The invigorating cold of the Adirondacks had its\ndrawbacks, as had Davos; and Stevenson, who, a few years before had\nfelt the sharp pinch of poverty at San Francisco, now chartered from\nthere a ship of his own, and sailed away out of the Golden Gate, on\nhis South Sea Odyssey, to those islands he had heard of years\nbefore, little thinking, as he listened \"till he was sick with\ndesire to go there,\" that talk was to be as a sign-post to him where\nto travel to. \"For Louis' sake,\" his mother explains in her racy\njournal letters, speaking of having chartered the Casco, \"I can't\nbut be glad, for his heart has so long been set upon it, it must\nsurely be good for his health to have such a desire granted.\" Louis\nwarned his mother years before she had a nomad for a son, but she\nhad never objected, and sat knitting on deck, well content not to be\n\"in turret pent,\" but to go forth with the bright sword she had\nforged. \"She adapted herself,\" her brother says, \"to her strange\nsurroundings, went about barefoot, found no heat too great for her,\nand at an age when her sisters at home were old ladies, learnt to\nride!\" After many wanderings through the warm ocean waters, with\n\"green days in forest and blue days at sea,\" the yachters finally\nsaw Samoa, and to the author it was the El Dorado of his dreams.\n\"When the Casco cast anchor,\" he avers, \"my soul went down with\nthese moorings, whence no windless may extract nor any diver fish it\nup.\" It was indeed a unique experience for one of the master workers\nof the world, one whose subtle mintage of words had made his readers\nhis friends, to settle in an uttermost isle of the Pacific. He\nthrove there, and was able to enjoy the flavour of the life of\nadventure he had craved for, and to look into the bright face of\ndanger. He built for himself a palace in the wild named Vailima.\nFrom Edinburgh came out the familiar furniture he had been brought\nup among, which had been the stage scenery of his chimney-corner\ndays, when the back bed-room chairs became a ship, and the sofa-back\nwas his hunter's camp. At Vailima he, like Ibsen's Peer Gynt,\nreceived \"a race gift from his childhood's home.\" He had in olden\ntimes played at being a minister like his grandfather, to wile away\na toyless Sunday. When he grew into his unorthodox dark shirt and\nvelvet-jacket stage, he had been a rebellious, rather atheistical\nyouth; but at Samoa, maybe to please his truly good, uncanting\nmother, or the sight of the belongings from his old home, made him\nbethink himself of his father's reverent conducting of family\nworship. He would have the same, but set to work and composed\nprayers for himself. Beautifully worded they are, full of his gospel\nof kindliness and gladness, and he read them with effective fervour\nin the hall of Vailima, with his betartaned servants gathered round.\nThese devotional exercises of his have been quoted by the \"unco\nguid\" to make him into what Henley severely styled \"a Seraph in\nChocolate, a barley-sugar effigy of a real man.\" The religious faith\nof Stevenson was the same as Ben Adhem's in Leigh Hunt's poem, who,\nwhen he found his name was not among those who loved the Lord,\ncheerily asked the angel to write him as one who loved his fellow-men.\nThe heavenly messenger returned\n\n    \"And showed the names whom love of God had blessed,\"\n     And \"lo! Ben Adhem's led all the rest\"\n\nTo Stevenson, throughout his life, all the world was truly a stage.\nHe went gaily along playing his part, and when he came to Samoa, he,\non whose brows the dews of youth still sparkled, gleefully revelled\nin the pomp and circumstance which allow him to make believe he was\na chieftain. He could go flower-bedecked and garlanded without\ncomment in among his adopted subjects. He paid deference to Samoan\ncodes of manners, a thing he had scorned to do in his native land.\n\nAll his life he indulged in too few relaxations. The grim Scots\ndivines, whose \"damnatory creed\" Louis objected to so strongly, in\ntheir studies, we read, reserved a corner for rod and gun. In his\nlibrary there was never a sign of sporting tools, not even a golf-club.\nHe was not effeminate; in fact, if \"the man had been dowered\nwith better health, we would have lost the author,\" says one speaker\nof him; but he simply never let go the pen, and, doubtless, his\nsingleness of purpose, his want of toil-resting hobbies, was\nhampering to his health. Walking-tours, during which he was busy all\nthe while taking mental notes for some article, was no brain\nholiday. In Samoa, he enjoyed the purest of pleasures, gardening.\n\"Nothing is so interesting,\" he says, in his VAILIMA LETTERS, \"as\nweeding, clearing, and path-making. It does make you feel so well.\"\nBut despite warring with weeds and forest rides, in an enervating\ncountry, he wrote persistently through the swooningly hot days of\ndamp heat.\n\n\"I have done my fiddling so long under Vesuvius, that I have almost\nforgotten to play, and can only wait for the eruption and think it\nlong of coming,\" he wrote; and shortly after, in December 1894, it\ncame and smote him down to the earth with merciful painlessness. His\nwife, his step-children, and his mother were beside him when, at the\nhighest water-mark his craftsmanship had reached, he paid the debt\nto overstrain, and laid him down with a will. The closing act of his\nlife's drama befitted his instinct for effective staging. As he lay\nshrouded in his nation's flag, the Samoans, who loved him, came to\npay their tribute and take farewell of their honey-tongued playmate\nand counsellor, Tusitala. They counted it an honour to be asked to\nhew a track through the tropic forest up which they bore him to his\nchosen resting-place on the mountain top of Vaea, overlooking\nVailima, There a table tombstone, like that over the martyrs' graves\non the hills of home, marks where this kindly Scot is laid, with the\nPacific for ever booming his dirge. Samoa, heretofore, to most was\nbut a speck on a great ocean of another hemisphere. Stevenson\ntransformed it into a \"Mecca of the Mind,\" where pilgrims, bearing\nhis name in remembrance, send their thoughts to do reverence at that\nshrine where,\n\n    \"High on his Patmos of the Southern Seas,\n     Our Northern dreamer sleeps\"\n\nno longer separated from his own country and kindred by a world of\nwaters, but, as another friend and poet said, divided from us now\nonly by the unbridged river of Death.\n\nOf his writings the list is long and varied, and forms a goodly\nheritage. Like himself, they are compounded of many parts, for he\nwas essayist, poet, novelist, traveller, moralist, biographer, and\nhistorian, and a Master of his Tools at all. Beside his own books,\nthrough many of which we may make his intimate acquaintance, his\nletters, and others telling the story of his life, form many\nvolumes. Stevenson advised every one to read often, not only the\nWaverley Novels, but the biography of good Sir Walter. \"His life,\"\nhe affirmed, \"was perhaps more unique than his work,\" and that\nremark applies to R. L. S. himself, as well as to his great\npredecessor. Having burned his immature efforts when he was\nfollowing his own \"private determination to be an author,\" when\nostensibly studying engineering, there are but two pamphlets,\nprinted in his boyhood, which are not written when he had acquired\nhis finished style. Louis' last creation, Weir of Hermiston, he\nhimself thought was his master-piece, and he was always his own\nsurest and severest critic. The portrait of the judge on whom he\nmodelled Hermiston, i.e., Braxfield, was not in Stevenson's advocate\ndays bequeathed to the Parliament House, but he had seen it in a\nRaeburn Exhibition he reviewed. He recollected the outward semblance\nof the man in his receptive memory till he resurrected Braxfield as\nHermiston. The half-told tale is in itself a monument which,\nunfinished though it be, shows us how clever an artificer Louis had\nbecome.\n\nAnd what manner of man to the outward eye was this gypsily-inclined\ndescendant of square-headed Scottish engineers? With his dark eyes\nlooking as if they had drunk in the sunshine in some southern land,\nhis uncut hair, his odd, shabby clothes clinging to his attenuated\nframe, his elaborate manners and habit of gesticulating as he spoke,\nhe was often mistaken for a starving musician or foreign mountebank.\nIt is not surprising that continental officials doubted his\npassport's statement that he was a Briton. In France he was\nimprisoned, and he complains he could not pass a frontier or visit a\nbank without suspicion. \"A slender, boyish presence, with a\ngraceful, somewhat fantastic bearing, and a singular power of\nattraction in the eyes and a smile were the first things that\nimpressed you,\" says his biographer. Like his mother, he remained to\nthe end of his life perennially young in appearance and spirits. The\nburden of years never weighed him down or dimmed his outlook. His\nface kindled and flushed with pleasure when he heard of a doughty\ndeed, a spice of wit, or some tale to his liking. Few drew him on\ncanvas in his lifetime, though he summered among artists. Sargent,\nin 1885, did a small full-length portrait of him, which \"is said to\nverge on caricature, and is in Boston. W. B. Richmond, R. A., about\nthe same time, at Bournemouth, began another in oils, not much more\nthan laid in in two sittings.\" Louis sat to an Italian, Count Nerli,\nin Samoa; but in this last portrait he looks painfully haggard,\nreminding us of his own words, \"the practice of letters is miserably\nharassing.\" Because of the too brilliant light elsewhere in Vailima,\nhe was painted in a room which was close, and the air fatigued him.\nWhile sitting, he wiled away an hour by making doggerel lines all to\nrhyme with the artist's name, Nerli. The portrait was bought by a\nScotch-woman travelling in New Zeal and, where, after the author's\ndeath, it had remained unsold. His mother, on returning to Scotland\nwhen bereft of her boy, asked to see the picture again. She had\ndisapproved of it in Samoa, as it was over true a likeness,\nrepresenting him sadly emaciated. Seeing it again, she revoked her\nformer judgment, and wished to possess it, but the purchaser also\nhad grown to prize it. So it hangs in her drawing-room, near by\nwhere the Eildons stand sentinel over Scott's resting-place. This\npicture of him who lies on Vaea's crest looks down with a slightly\nquizzical expression, as if amused at finding himself ensconced in a\nplace of honour in the house of strangers on Tweedside. Photographs\nthere are in plenty of Stevenson, and one snapshot, enlarged in the\nEdinburgh Edition, recalls him looking up with \"long, hatchet face,\nblack hair, and haunting gaze, that follows as you move about the\nroom.\" But his likeness was as difficult for the photographer, or\nthe sun, to catch, as for the painter to put on canvas, for the\npeculiar fascination of the living man lay in himself, in the\nelusive charm of his smile, and in his manner of speech. However,\nhis contemporaries have left their printed records of his appearance\nand his peculiar personality. Henley's perfect description in verse\nis too well known to need quotation. Ugly, Stevenson called himself,\nbut this was not so. He was original in looks and mind, his lank\nbrown hair straggled over his high forehead, and framed his thin,\nhigh-cheeked, sallow, oval face. His brown eyes and full red lips\ngave a dash of colour to his features. His schoolmate, Mr. Baildon,\nsays truly, \"his eyes were always genial, however gaily the lights\ndanced in them; but about the mouth there was something of trickery\nand mocking, as of a spirit that had already peeped behind the\nscenes of Life's pageant, and more than guessed its unrealities.\"\n\nRepose he never tasted of, for his zest in life, his adventurous\ninclination to explore, his insatiable curiosity, kept him ever\nmoving at topmost speed. To understand the mainspring which affected\nthe man's character--the machinery that supplied him with an\ninexhaustible nerve force and vitality--Mr Colvin explains, \"besides\nhumour, which kept wholesome laughter always ready at his lips, was\na perfectly warm, loyal, and tender heart, which, through all his\nexperiments and agitations, made the law of kindness the one ruling\nlaw of his life.\" He marvelled, on his way through the Pilgrim's\nProgress, why the man with the muck-rake grovelled in straws and\ndust, and never looked up to the glittering crown held out for his\nacceptance. This mulish blindness puzzled the boy, and when he grew\nup, he opened the eyes, and illumined by his work and his example\nthe dreary-hearted who wasted their opportunities, not seeing the\nnumber of beautiful things which made the world into a royal\npleasance. With tuneful words he persuaded those who plodded with\ndusty feet along the high-road to pause for a while and saunter\namong the greener fields of earth, and through the stimulating\ncourage that shone through every chapter he wrote, he, like his\nsires, \"the ready and the strong of word,\" has, by his works, left\nlights to shine upon the paths of men.",
