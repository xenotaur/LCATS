    "body": "The trace wound through the rolling wooded prairies of \u201cthe Nation,\u201d\nwhere clearings were carpeted with rustling dead leaves and dry grass.\nThe light spring wagon bounced over ruts, though the team was wearied by\na long day in harness and the wagon\u2019s pace was slow. The driver was a\ncowboy--just a lean brown cowboy with nothing to set him apart\nparticularly from any of a thousand others in this year of \u201977, when\nTexas trail herds were moving north and ever north in the great hegira\nthat was to stock ranges from the Nation to the Selkirks with Texas\nlonghorns.\n\nThe black-haired man on the seat beside the driver was shorter--five\nfull inches below six feet--and powerfully muscled of shoulder.\nTwenty-six years old, he was, with a face that might have belonged to a\nboy for all the brown mustache at which he now tugged thoughtfully, as\nrestless dark eyes looked around in half a dozen ways at once.\n\nSuddenly the driver, who had been moving restlessly on the box-seat,\njerked in the travel-worn horses so that they fairly sat down upon their\nhaunches.\n\n\u201cI been a-smellin\u2019 smoke for five minutes!\u201d he muttered. \u201cI wonder now\nif----\u201d\n\nOne lean brown hand, the left, gripped the lines. The right had curled\nabout the sinister black butt of a long-barreled Frontier Colt.\n\n\u201cI smell it, too!\u201d nodded his companion tensely. \u201cHell! I see it.\nYonder!\u201d\n\nA light film, that was barely detectable against the treetops a hundred\nyards ahead, showed faintly gray.\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 that damn\u2019 axle a-squeakin\u2019 like a dyin\u2019 shote!\u201d snarled the\ndriver. \u201cReckon they heard us?\u201d\n\nHe was furious-faced, glaring at the lacy smoke-film as at sign of an\nenemy. But the dark, stocky man was on the ground with a snaky wriggle,\nand he took with him the .44 Winchester carbine that had been hanging in\nits scabbard from the wagon-seat. He vanished into the bushes, and with\nan oath the driver flipped the lines in loops about the brake-handle and\nleaped down to follow.\n\nHe was not so good a woodsman as the other, so his progress, to be\nnoiseless, must be slower. He met the dark-haired man coming back\ngrinning. There was something tight-lipped, rather grim, about that\nsmile which showed large, white teeth.\n\n\u201cSoldiers!\u201d he whispered. \u201cThey\u2019ve already heard us. We just got to go\non and trust to luck. They\u2019re sneakin\u2019 into the brush right now to look\nus up.\u201d\n\nThey went back to the wagon quickly, mounted to the seat again and drove\non. Fifty, seventy-five yards forward; then from the brush on each side\nof the trace burst blue-clad men, afoot. A smart, boyish lieutenant\nstepped up to the front wheel.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d he demanded.\n\nThe driver looked sidelong at his companion, who grinned down at the\nofficer.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d he drawled, \u201cwe\u2019re a couple o\u2019 cowboys a-goin\u2019 home to Santone.\nOur names wouldn\u2019t mean nothin\u2019, I reckon. Been--\u201d vaguely he waved his\narm to indicate the vast spaces behind him--\u201cup north with a trail herd.\nCharlie Howell\u2019s trail herd.\u201d\n\nCavalrymen had edged closer to the wagon by this time, glancing in\ncuriously at the jumble of bedding and clothes-bags. The black-haired\nman who had done the explaining to the lieutenant gave them no heed;\nstill he grinned down, quite frankly and friendly, upon the officer.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, Cap\u2019n,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019d like to camp along with\nyou-all tonight. By gosh! Wish we could make a trade with you to ride\nwith us till we get clean out o\u2019 the Nation!\u201d He laughed infectiously.\n\u201cTwo nights back, me\u2019n Bill, here, we camped with a bunch we overtook.\nWe never got what you might call a good night\u2019s sleep. I seen\nwild-lookin\u2019 fellows, but the tall one a-leadin\u2019 that gang he took the\nprize. We was sure glad to get away next mornin\u2019 an\u2019 I don\u2019t mind sayin\u2019\nwe sort o\u2019 figgered so\u2019s one o\u2019 us was always facin\u2019 their way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nation isn\u2019t much of a health resort,\u201d nodded the lieutenant,\nsmiling in his turn. \u201cWell, come along. We\u2019ll see that you have a good\nnight\u2019s sleep tonight, anyway.\u201d\n\nThe wagon moved on, with the cavalrymen accompanying, into a wide\nclearing where the twenty-odd soldiers of the detachment had bivouacked.\nAfter supper the two cowboys sought out the lieutenant, who alone had a\ntent. He was lonely, being the only officer with the detachment; also he\nhad been thinking over the reference to a hard bunch somewhere to the\nnorth. The cowboys found him ready to talk.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re up here scouting around for some train-robbers who held up a U.\nP. train at Ogallala, Nebraska,\u201d he told them, as they sat smoking\noutside the tent. \u201cThere were six, altogether, in the gang. We heard\nthat two were killed shortly after the robbery at a little place called\nBuffalo Stage up in Kansas.\u201d\n\n\u201cHell! Them fellows\u2019ll never come down this way!\u201d cried the taller\ncowboy, he who had driven the wagon, with much emphasis. \u201cNot much!\u201d\n\nThe dark-haired man shot a furious glance sidelong at the emphatic one.\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 why not?\u201d he snapped. \u201cDon\u2019t ever\u2019 Tom, Dick an\u2019 Harry that\u2019s on\nthe dodge head for the Nation? You think with them fancy boots o\u2019 yours,\nBill! Reckon ol\u2019 Lengthy\u2019s gang, that was so free with hard looks for\nus, is a bunch o\u2019 Sunday school superintendents, mebbe? Could you get up\nin court an\u2019 swear that they wasn\u2019t this gang that stuck up that train?\u201d\n\n\u201cMebbe you\u2019re right, Frank,\u201d nodded the driver meekly.\n\n\u201cHow many were in this gang you camped with?\u201d Thus the lieutenant,\nleaning forward eagerly.\n\n\u201cWhy, the tall fellow an\u2019 three ornery lookin\u2019 customers. That is,\nthey hadn\u2019t had a wash or shave for a right smart while. Horses looked\nlike they\u2019d been hard rid----\u201d\n\nHe was rolling a cigarette, the black-haired man. Now he looked up\nsideway at the lieutenant, as he put away Durham and papers, with the\nready grin that showed his white teeth.\n\n\u201cProb\u2019ly didn\u2019t look no worse, at that,\u201d he smiled, \u201cthan me\u2019n Bill\nhere!\u201d\n\nThe lieutenant laughed with him, then sobered abruptly.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you fellows happened along,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI think I\u2019ll\nhave a look at your back-trail tomorrow and see if I can have a talk\nwith Lengthy and his friends. Four, eh? By Jove! That would be the\ntally, now, if they killed two in Kansas!\u201d\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nBehind the spring-wagon rolling south again with dawn, the cavalry camp\nhad vanished. The troopers were in the saddle, heading north to\ninvestigate \u201cLengthy.\u201d The black-haired man turned on the box-seat and\nhis white teeth showed; he shook with noiseless laughter.\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 he\u2019s goin\u2019 to have a look at \u2018Lengthy!\u2019 he exploded suddenly. \u201cOh,\nLawdy! I sure wish him lots o\u2019 luck!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, he pitched a big scare into me, just the same!\u201d nodded Jack\nDavis, sourly. \u2018When he says he\u2019s a-lookin\u2019 for train-robbers, Sam, I\ncould count the bars on the winder!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe never scared me half as much as you did!\u201d grunted Sam Bass,\nirritably. \u201cYou blame\u2019 fool! You like to make him suspicious o\u2019 us!\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you reckon they are a-lookin\u2019 for us?\u201d Jack Davis was plainly uneasy\nat the thought. \u201cHell! Mebbe we better not figger on goin\u2019 to Denton,\nSam! We got twenty thousand between us. Let\u2019s head for South America.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Sam Bass\u2019 square jaw was set and his mouth tight beneath the brown\nmustache. \u201cNo, sir! There\u2019s folks in Denton I want to show a few. They\nalways said I\u2019d never amount to nothin\u2019, a-runnin\u2019 around the country\nlike I did, clean down to Dallas, to race the Denton Mare. I want to\nparade down the street a-throwin\u2019 twenty-dollar gold-pieces over the\nbars. We\u2019ll have a look, though, before we ride in.\u201d\n\nJack Davis, whose nerves were tense from uncertainty these days, and who\nshared none of Sam Bass\u2019 pleasure at nearing Denton, nodded gloomily.\n\n\u201c\u2019S a good idee,\u201d he said. \u201cBut me, I wisht we was high-tailin\u2019 it for\nSouth America.\u201d\n\nTo which Sam replied with a glint of white teeth beneath his mustache,\nas they squatted on the edge of the bottoms, waiting for dusk and his\ntrip to the house of a certain good friend.\n\nIf Sheriff Everhart and certain others of the oldsters in the community\nhad looked askance at Sam and his wild ways, almost without exception\nthe younger generation had been always on his side. As the owner of that\nlittle sorrel beauty, The Denton Mare, he had been known far and wide;\nknown and liked immensely.\n\nIt was not, altogether, that he was a rider without peer; a dead shot\nwith Winchester or Colt; leader in any daring enterprise of \u201cthe boys,\u201d\na master cowboy. Nor was his popularity born wholly of generosity and a\ncertain rough chivalry, though these qualities he had in large measure.\nOthers have had the every characteristic of Sam Bass, yet have waked no\nsuch fierce loyalty as this stocky, dark-eyed cowboy knew; such\nadmiration in Cowland, where he is a heroic figure even today.\n\nFrom friends in Denton Sam learned that an Ogallala man, an ex-express\nmessenger, had suspected the six cowboys of the train robbery, though\nthe Officials had not been suspicious of them as, in the days after the\nrobbery, they mingled with sheriffs and marshals and railroad detectives\nin Ogallala. He had trailed the party southward, this ex-messenger, and\nspying upon their camp had heard them discuss the crime; had learned\ntheir plans, their real names; had even seen them handling bright new\ngold-pieces of the year 1877. His knowledge he had communicated to the\nofficials. The law wanted Sam Bass and Jack Davis--wanted them hard.\n\nSo to Jack Davis, hiding in the elm-bottoms, Sam Bass took back the\nstory of the search and the large reward offered for them. To the\nauthenticated report of the death of Collins and Heffridge, two of their\ngang, he added the account of the killing of another, Jim Berry, in his\nhome town, Mexico, Missouri, where Berry\u2019s shining new gold-pieces had\nconnected him with the robbery.\n\n\u201cThat leaves just three out o\u2019 the six,\u201d said Sam. \u201cSeems Ol\u2019 Dad\nUnderwood never went to Missoury with Jim Berry. Anyway, they never got\nhim.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you we\u2019d better hit for South America!\u201d complained Jack Davis,\nwhose bump of discretion seems to have been well-developed. \u201c\u2019Tain\u2019t too\nlate now. Let\u2019s high-tail it, Sam. We can\u2019t buck all this.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, what\u2019s to be scared of?\u201d scoffed Sam, those large white teeth\nshowing in his famous grin. \u201cDon\u2019t I know this-here country like the\npalm o\u2019 my hand? Don\u2019t be losin\u2019 your nerve, Jack! We\u2019ll just stick here\nan\u2019 be damned to \u2019em to catch us.\u201d\n\nBut Jack Davis was beyond persuasion. He never had thought such a\nhornets\u2019 nest would be aroused by that U. P. robbery. While planning it,\nCollins had stressed the large chance of their never being recognized.\nTo be \u201con the dodge\u201d in the face of such widespread and earnest search\nbroke Davis\u2019 nerve. So from the elm-bottoms outside of Denton, Jack\nDavis rode hell-for-leather; rode out of the picture entirely. Whether\nhe made South America, or started afresh under another name in the\nStates there is no authentic report. But certain it is that neither he\nnor Old Dad Underwood ever paid the penalty, officially, for the crime.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nSam Bass, who had left Denton that spring a likable, bull-headed, but\nhonest cowboy, came home a famous outlaw, fit to mention with Jesse\nJames and the Youngers. Nor did he lack apologists. Texas had always\nheld itself somewhat aloof from national affairs; what a man did\nelsewhere seldom worried the Texans, so long as he obeyed the code in\ntheir midst.\n\nNow it was complained that Texan authorities were pulling Nebraska\nchestnuts from what might well be a hot fire; that Sam Bass was being\npersecuted in this state when he had committed no crime whatsoever\nagainst the sovereignty of Texas.\n\nMeanwhile, moving through the well-known county with a surety, a\nprescience, almost, that baffled his pursuers, Sam Bass gained a\nfollowing. Attracted by his reputation--perhaps by thought of that\nnot-yet-spent ten thousand in shiny gold-pieces of \u201977--men appeared\nunobtrusively in the elm-bottoms.\n\nSo came Henry Underwood, with Arkansas Johnson, Sebe Barnes, Jim Murphy,\nyoung Frank Jackson, Pipes Herndon; later, two or three others not so\nwell known joined the gang. Daring, dangerous men, some of these, men\nwith records as gun-fighters, as hard characters when \u201con the prod.\u201d But\nSam Bass was their undisputed leader.\n\nNot long could such a group be content to ride into the little hamlets\nof Denton and Dallas and Tarrant Counties, to \u201cbelly up to the bar\u201d and\namuse themselves with occupations so mild as the mere downing of Old\nJordan and shooting at marks--in or out of the saloons--and talking of\npast doings. The logical thought came to Bass that he could be hunted no\nmore than he was. He had committed no crime in Texas, yet Texan officers\nchased him. He had the name; it would cost him little or nothing to get\nthe game.\n\nThe gang\u2019s first job was the robbery of a Texas and Pacific train at\nEagle Ford, some seven miles west of Dallas. It was a simple job to stop\nthe train near the sleepy little farming village and go through it.\nThereafter, two or three similar robberies were executed with no\nfeatures particularly interesting. Considering the numbers in Sam Bass\u2019\ngang, the profit was small, averaging perhaps five hundred dollars per\nman in each robbery. It is not his train-robberies which give the\ninterest to the career of Sam Bass upon which his tradition rests, but\nthe masterly fashion in which for months he tied sheriffs\u2019 posses and\nTexas Rangers into knots.\n\nJohn B. Jones was Adjutant-General of Texas during 1877\u20138 and so\ncommanded the Texas Rangers. Jones was an able and experienced officer,\nand the train-robberies of Sam Bass, which were becoming very frequent,\nroused him to unusual energy. Having visited Denton, Dallas and the\nsurrounding country personally, he organized a new company of thirty\nRangers at Dallas, giving the command to Captain June Peak.\n\nTo this company was given the specific duty of capturing the Sam Bass\nGang, but figuratively, if not actually, Sam mocked Captain Peak and his\nclumsy, inexperienced recruits. It is said that, counting Rangers and\nsheriffs\u2019 posses, at least a hundred men now took the trail of Texas\u2019\ntrain-robber premier. Yet tradition has it, also, that during his time\n\u201con the dodge\u201d Sam himself was rarely, if ever, driven out of the three\nadjoining counties of Denton, Dallas and Tarrant. The wooded nature of\nthe country in this locality made it simple for him to elude the\nblundering officers.\n\nNot always did the gang hold together, now. Bass\u2019 second-in-command, the\ndaredevil Arkansas Johnson, was killed at Salt Creek in Wise County by\nCaptain Peak\u2019s Rangers. Then Pipes Herndon and Jim Murphy were captured.\nSam himself, with Sebe Barnes and young Frank Jackson, were the only\nmembers out of jail, and they hugged the elm-bottoms of Denton County.\nThe handwriting on the wall became clear now. This dodging might go on\nalmost indefinitely, but the nerve-racking strain was telling on them\nall; they were weary of it. Sam decided to leave his beloved north Texas\nand in Mexico or some other foreign country make a new start.\n\nTo General Jones, by this time, the intent to capture or kill Sam Bass\nhad become an obsession. We may shrug away mention of stool pigeons and\ntraitors as necessary units of police equipment, but by Texans\ngenerally, and especially by the cowboys, who regarded Sam Bass as one\nof themselves, the methods of General Jones were given no fancy names\nwhatever.\n\nJim Murphy was the tool chosen by Jones. To Murphy, then in jail\nawaiting Federal trial for robbery of the mails, Jones went with the\noffer of freedom on condition that he execute a certain plan which would\nresult in Sam Bass\u2019 betrayal into the officers\u2019 hands. Murphy, to give\nhim the tiny modicum of credit one may, at first rejected the proposal,\neven though life imprisonment seemed its alternative. But Jones was\npersistent, and finally threats and promises together overcame Murphy\u2019s\nremembrance of Sam Bass\u2019 many kindnesses to the needy Murphy clan.\n\n    Jim Murphy was arrested and then released on bail.\n    He jumped his bond at Tyler and then took the train for Terrell.\n    But Major Jones had posted Jim and that was all a stall;\n    \u2019Twas only a plan to capture Sam before the coming fall.\n\nSo runs a verse of the old ballad. With the clear, unquibbling judgment\nof the outdoors, it tells unmincingly the tale of Jones\u2019 plan to trap\nSam Bass.\n\nMurphy, having been released on bail supplied by certain men in Jones\u2019\nconfidence, jumped his bond and a great hue-and-cry was raised. As had\nbeen planned, it preceded Jim Murphy to Denton, where he rejoined Sam\nBass, Sebe Barnes and Frank Jackson. But friends of Bass and Barnes had\nwritten warning that this looked to be a snare; that the bondsmen were\nprobably creatures of General Jones. Confronted with these letters, for\nhis very life Murphy played his part in masterly fashion--without,\nhowever, convincing Sam and Barnes. The white-faced, protesting traitor\nread murder in their hard eyes and restless gunhands.\n\nFrank Jackson, barely twenty-two years old, had become with Arkansas\nJohnson\u2019s death, Sam\u2019s right-hand man. Now Frank took Murphy\u2019s part,\ndeclaring his belief in the traitor\u2019s good faith. But there were tense\nmoments in the dusky elm-bottoms, with Sam and Sebe Barnes glaring\nmurderously at the trembling Murphy, before Frank Jackson flung down his\nultimatum: they must kill him before they killed Murphy.\n\nIt was decided to rob a bank and then strike out for Mexico. So, early\nin July, 1878, the four riders left Denton County forever, heading\nsouth. Just outside of Waco the four made camp and looked over the town.\nIn a saloon frequented by cattlemen, so tradition has it, Sam Bass flung\ndown a twenty-dollar gold-piece upon the bar, with a bitter sentence\nthat sums up all the pros and cons of such a life as his, weighing all\nthe tinsel glory against the myriad hardships of the outlaw\u2019s lot.\n\n\u201cThere goes the last U. P. goldpiece,\u201d he grunted, watching moodily as\nit spun toward the bartender\u2019s waiting hand. \u201cAn\u2019 a lot o\u2019 good they\ndone me!\u201d\n\nSam decided that a job in Waco would be too dangerous to attempt, hence\nthe quartet mounted their horses again and jogged on south, steadily\nnearing the state capital at Austin, where Jones sat waiting for word\nfrom his tool.\n\nTo Jones came a hastily scrawled note postmarked Belton, saying that Sam\nBass moved toward Round Rock in Williamson County, there to rob the\nbank. Then ensued action upon the quiet capital grounds!\n\nThere was a Ranger company stationed at San Saba, under the veteran\nthief-taker, Lieutenant N. O. Reynolds. One of the headquarters\ndetachment killed a horse getting to Reynolds, while Jones himself,\nhaving dispatched R. C. Ware and two other Rangers to Round Rock,\nfollowed the next morning.\n\nUpon coming into Round Rock, Jones warned local officials that the Bass\nGang was coming. In the Texas of that day these words were enough to\ninsure feverish activity in any town, small or large. On no account,\nJones insisted, were the town officers to attempt an arrest before the\narrival of Reynolds and his Rangers.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nFriday, July 19, 1878. Reynolds\u2019 Company E. Frontier Battalion, Texas\nRangers, had made the one hundred fifty miles from San Saba to old Round\nRock at top speed and in early afternoon pitched camp outside of town.\nSam Bass, with Barnes, Jackson and Murphy, were also camped upon the\ntown\u2019s outskirts. The outlaws rode into town for a last check-up of the\nrobbery\u2019s details. Murphy, sensing the final scene so soon to be played,\nupon some pretext dropped behind. So Bass and Barnes and young Frank\nJackson came up to Copprel\u2019s store together. As they went inside they\nwere noticed by the two local deputy sheriffs, Moore and Grimes.\n\nThey stared hard at the three dusty strangers, but apparently without\nthought that the trio were the famous outlaws they were awaiting, upon\nwhose heads were placed rewards by states and railroads and express\ncompanies. When Sam Bass\u2019 broad shoulders had disappeared within the\ndoor Moore turned to Grimes.\n\n\u201cI think those fellows got guns on,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think so, too,\u201d nodded Grimes. \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 in an\u2019 search \u2019em.\u201d\n\nHe went in, a hero and a martyr, in a way; but history as written by the\ncool and practical judgment of rangeland in fifty years makes him, also,\nand more so, pretty much \u201cplain damned fool.\u201d For he took none of the\nmechanical precautions of the wary peace officer confronting strangers.\nAs Grimes stepped inside, Moore trailed him to the door and stood\nblinking.\n\nAt Grimes\u2019 entrance the trio at the counter whirled instinctively. For a\nlong instant deputy sheriff and outlaws eyed each other.\n\n\u201cI think you fellows got guns on,\u201d said Grimes, a trifle belligerently.\n\u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 to search you,\u201d he added, in the dead silence that greeted\nhis speech.\n\nSomething about the silent group must have struck a warning note within\nhim. For now, gun hand going toward Colt butt, he began to back toward\nthe door, where Moore still stood gaping at the play inside.\n\n\u201cSure, we got guns!\u201d snarled Sam Bass suddenly.\n\nAs if the phrase were a signal, his gun and Barnes\u2019 and Jackson\u2019s\nflashed out. There was a rolling roar, deafening in the confined space\nof Copprel\u2019s store, as three Colts flung heavy bullets into the luckless\ndeputy. Grimes staggered under the triple impact, but continued to back\nout. Moore had leaped aside and Grimes reached the sidewalk, to crash\nforward upon his face. After him sprang the outlaws, sensing a trap,\nscenting disaster. Moore was shot through the lungs as he snatched\nbelatedly at his Colt.\n\nRanger Dick Ware was sitting in the barber shop almost next door,\nwaiting for a shave. The heavy three-in-one report from the store jerked\nhim to his feet. Automatically his Colt came out and he stepped into the\nstreet, to come almost face to face with the outlaws, who stood staring\ndown at the bodies upon the sidewalk.\n\nAn utterly fearless man, this Ranger Dick Ware, worthy exponent of all\nthe heroic traditions of the service. Odds of three to one might well\nhave sent a genuinely brave officer back indoors to fire from cover. But\nWare ran toward them, his .45 flipping up. There was a hitching post on\nthe sidewalk and bullets from Bass\u2019 gang knocked splinters from it that\nstruck Ware in the face. But he came on, firing rapidly. A bullet struck\nSam Bass\u2019 cartridge belt, broke two shells, and mushrooming, tore his\nright kidney to ribbons.\n\nGeneral Jones, at this moment coming up-street, heard the staccato\nrattle of the firing and came on the run as Bass and the others backed\ntoward their horses. Jones had but a small-calibre double-action Colt,\nbut he entered the duel blithely, joining Dick Ware. The other two\nRangers who had come to Round Rock with Ware now ran up also, while from\ndoorways up and down the street appeared armed citizens to open fire\nupon the trio by the horses.\n\nBarnes was shot dead, Bass was mortally wounded. Only young Frank\nJackson now stood erect, and, with bravery equal to Dick Ware\u2019s, he kept\nup the outlaws\u2019 end of the firing while with left hand he unhitched Sam\nBass\u2019 horse. Bullets fairly rained around him from all directions as he\nhelped Bass into the saddle, then sprang upon his own animal.\n\nOut through Old Round Rock galloped the two frightened horses, Bass\nreeling in the saddle, Frank Jackson holding him up. Jim Murphy, the\ntraitor, pale, shaken, stricken by we know not what torture of remorse,\nor, perhaps, none at all, saw the two escaping.\n\nFor the rest of that day Bass and Jackson vanished from sight. Posses\nand Ranger detachments scoured the vicinity, but not until Saturday\nmorning did Rangers find Sam Bass, alone, near death, lying beneath a\nlarge oak. He admitted his identity and made no resistance.\n\nJackson had insisted upon remaining with his dying leader, but\nBass--game, unselfish to the last, the cowboys\u2019 ideal now as he had been\nin brighter days--was equally insistent that Frank save himself. So,\nhaving made Bass as comfortable as possible, unwillingly Jackson\nescaped.\n\nTaken into Round Rock, Bass received the best attention local medicos\ncould administer. But he died on Sunday, July 21st, his twenty-seventh\nbirthday, steadfastly refusing to give the names of associates or\nfriends. Upon the tombstone set to mark his grave was carved the\ninscription:\n\n                            SAMUEL BASS\n                       Born July 21st, 1851\n                       Died July 21st, 1878\n                A brave man reposes in death here.\n                       Why was he not true?\n\nFrank Jackson, after Sam Bass\u2019 death, asked only for an opportunity to\nmeet the traitor, Jim Murphy. But the latter evaded him and finally\ncommitted suicide. So the famous Bass Gang was finally broken up, but\nthe memory of Sam and Frank Jackson, of Sebe Barnes and Arkansas, and of\nthe traitor Murphy, is green today in Texas.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nA few years ago, the writer was returning to Texas from New York, in\ncompany with a San Angelo cowboy. We unloaded the Mercer roadster on the\nMallory dock at Galveston and started for El Paso. Coming into a land of\nwide prairies near Menard, vast and bleak under the pitiless December\nwind, we encountered three lean riders in two gallon Stetsons and Fort\nWorth boots and stopped to pass the time of day, the Durham and the\nquart. When we had gossiped a while of range affairs and with benumbed\nfingers wrapped tobacco in those huge, thick brown papers colloquially\nknown in Cattle Land as \u201csaddle blankets,\u201d we said \u201cso long\u201d to the\ncowboys and they jogged on.\n\nThe tall puncher in the checked mackinaw began to sing in a high,\ndolorous tenor, swaying to his pony\u2019s running-walk:\n\n    \u201cSam Bass was born in Indiana, it was his native home;\n    And at the age of seventeen, young Sam began to roam,\n    He first came down to Texas, a cowboy for to be,\n    A kinder hearted fellow, you seldom ever see!\u201d\n\nBeside me, mechanically Morg took up the old ballad that every Texan\nknows, that I had not heard for years; sang it to the last verse, which\ndeals with Jim Murphy\u2019s treachery:\n\n    \u201cAnd so he sold out Sam and Barnes and left their friends to mourn.\n    Oh, what a scorching Jim will get when Gabriel blows his horn!\n    Perhaps he\u2019s got to heaven; there\u2019s none of us can say;\n    But if I am right in my surmise, he\u2019s gone the other way!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a great guy, Sam,\u201d opined Morg, Twentieth Century cowpuncher.\n\u201cHadn\u2019t been for that blanked illegitimate, Murphy, he wouldn\u2019t have\nbeen caught, either!\u201d\n\n          *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SAM BASS ***\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\nSection 3.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S.

For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.",
