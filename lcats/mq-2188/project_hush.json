    "body": "I don't know who thought it up, and I certainly would never ask, but\nwhoever it was, he should have known better. Damn it, when you want a\nproject kept secret, you _don't_ give it a designation like that! You\ngive it something neutral, some name like the Manhattan and Overlord\nthey used in World War II, which won't excite anybody's curiosity.\n\nBut we were stuck with Project Hush and we had to take extra measures to\nensure secrecy. A couple of times a week, everyone on the project had to\nreport to Psycho for DD & HA--dream detailing and hypnoanalysis--instead\nof the usual monthly visit. Naturally, the commanding general of the\nheavily fortified research post to which we were attached could not ask\nwhat we were doing, under penalty of court-martial, but he had to be\ngiven further instructions to shut off his imagination like a faucet\nevery time he heard an explosion. Some idiot in Washington was actually\ngoing to list Project Hush in the military budget by name! It took fast\naction, I can tell you, to have it entered under Miscellaneous \"X\"\nResearch.\n\nWell, we'd covered the unforgivable blunder, though not easily, and now\nwe could get down to the real business of the project. You know, of\ncourse, about the A-bomb, H-bomb and C-bomb because information that\nthey existed had been declassified. You don't know about the other\nweapons being devised--and neither did we, reasonably enough, since they\nweren't our business--but we had been given properly guarded\nnotification that they were in the works. Project Hush was set up to\ncounter the new weapons.\n\nOur goal was not just to reach the Moon. We had done that on 24 June\n1967 with an unmanned ship that carried instruments to report back data\non soil, temperature, cosmic rays and so on. Unfortunately, it was put\nout of commission by a rock slide.\n\nAn unmanned rocket would be useless against the new weapons. We had to\nget to the Moon before any other country did and set up a permanent\nstation--an armed one--and do it without anybody else knowing about it.\n\nI guess you see now why we on (_damn_ the name!) Project Hush were so\nconcerned about security. But we felt pretty sure, before we took off,\nthat we had plugged every possible leak.\n\nWe had, all right. Nobody even knew we had raised ship.\n\n\n\nWe landed at the northern tip of Mare Nubium, just off Regiomontanus,\nand, after planting a flag with appropriate throat-catching ceremony,\nhad swung into the realities of the tasks we had practiced on so many\ndry runs back on Earth. Major Monroe Gridley prepared the big rocket,\nwith its tiny cubicle of living space, for the return journey to Earth\nwhich he alone would make.\n\nLieutenant-colonel Thomas Hawthorne painstakingly examined our\nprovisions and portable quarters for any damage that might have been\nincurred in landing.\n\nAnd I, Colonel Benjamin Rice, first commanding officer of Army Base No.\n1 on the Moon, dragged crate after enormous crate out of the ship on my\naching academic back, and piled them in the spot two hundred feet away\nwhere the plastic dome would be built.\n\nWe all finished at just about the same time, as per schedule, and went\ninto Phase Two.\n\nMonroe and I started work on building the dome. It was a simple pre-fab\naffair, but big enough to require an awful lot of assembling. Then,\nafter it was built, we faced the real problem--getting all the complex\ninternal machinery in place and in operating order.\n\nMeanwhile, Tom Hawthorne took his plump self off in the single-seater\nrocket which, up to then, had doubled as a lifeboat.\n\nThe schedule called for him to make a rough three-hour scouting survey\nin an ever-widening spiral from our dome. This had been regarded as a\nprobable waste of time, rocket fuel and manpower--but a necessary\nprecaution. He was supposed to watch for such things as bug-eyed\nmonsters out for a stroll on the Lunar landscape. Basically, however,\nTom's survey was intended to supply extra geological and astronomical\nmeat for the report which Monroe was to carry back to Army HQ on Earth.\n\nTom was back in forty minutes. His round face, inside its transparent\nbubble helmet, was fish-belly white. And so were ours, once he told us\nwhat he'd seen.\n\nHe had seen another dome.\n\n\"The other side of Mare Nubium--in the Riphaen Mountains,\" he babbled\nexcitedly. \"It's a little bigger than ours, and it's a little flatter on\ntop. And it's not translucent, either, with splotches of different\ncolors here and there--it's a dull, dark, heavy gray. But that's all\nthere is to see.\"\n\n\"No markings on the dome?\" I asked worriedly. \"No signs of anyone--or\nanything--around it?\"\n\n\"Neither, Colonel.\" I noticed he was calling me by my rank for the first\ntime since the trip started, which meant he was saying in effect, \"Man,\nhave you got a decision to make!\"\n\n\"Hey, Tom,\" Monroe put in. \"Couldn't be just a regularly shaped bump in\nthe ground, could it?\"\n\n\"I'm a geologist, Monroe. I can distinguish artificial from natural\ntopography. Besides--\" he looked up--\"I just remembered something I left\nout. There's a brand-new tiny crater near the dome--the kind usually\nleft by a rocket exhaust.\"\n\n\"Rocket exhaust?\" I seized on that. \"_Rockets_, eh?\"\n\n\n\nTom grinned a little sympathetically. \"Spaceship exhaust, I should have\nsaid. You can't tell from the crater what kind of propulsive device\nthese characters are using. It's not the same kind of crater our\nrear-jets leave, if that helps any.\"\n\nOf course it didn't. So we went into our ship and had a council of war.\nAnd I do mean war. Both Tom and Monroe were calling me Colonel in every\nother sentence. I used their first names every chance I got.\n\nStill, no one but me could reach a decision. About what to do, I mean.\n\n\"Look,\" I said at last, \"here are the possibilities. They know we are\nhere--either from watching us land a couple of hours ago or from\nobserving Tom's scout-ship--or they do not know we are here. They are\neither humans from Earth--in which case they are in all probability\nenemy nationals--or they are alien creatures from another planet--in\nwhich case they may be friends, enemies or what-have-you. I think common\nsense and standard military procedure demand that we consider them\nhostile until we have evidence to the contrary. Meanwhile, we proceed\nwith extreme caution, so as not to precipitate an interplanetary war\nwith potentially friendly Martians, or whatever they are.\n\n\"All right. It's vitally important that Army Headquarters be informed of\nthis immediately. But since Moon-to-Earth radio is still on the drawing\nboards, the only way we can get through is to send Monroe back with the\nship. If we do, we run the risk of having our garrison force, Tom and\nme, captured while he's making the return trip. In that case, their side\nwinds up in possession of important information concerning our personnel\nand equipment, while our side has only the bare knowledge that somebody\nor something else has a base on the Moon. So our primary need is more\ninformation.\n\n\"Therefore, I suggest that I sit in the dome on one end of a telephone\nhookup with Tom, who will sit in the ship, his hand over the firing\nbutton, ready to blast off for Earth the moment he gets the order from\nme. Monroe will take the single-seater down to the Riphaen Mountains,\nlanding as close to the other dome as he thinks safe. He will then\nproceed the rest of the way on foot, doing the best scouting job he can\nin a spacesuit.\n\n\"He will not use his radio, except for agreed-upon nonsense syllables to\ndesignate landing the single-seater, coming upon the dome by foot, and\nwarning me to tell Tom to take off. If he's captured, remembering that\nthe first purpose of a scout is acquiring and transmitting knowledge of\nthe enemy, he will snap his suit radio on full volume and pass on as\nmuch data as time and the enemy's reflexes permit. How does that sound\nto you?\"\n\nThey both nodded. As far as they were concerned, the command decision\nhad been made. But I was sitting under two inches of sweat.\n\n\"One question,\" Tom said. \"Why did you pick Monroe for the scout?\"\n\n\"I was afraid you'd ask that,\" I told him. \"We're three extremely\nunathletic Ph.D.s who have been in the Army since we finished our\nschooling. There isn't too much choice. But I remembered that Monroe is\nhalf Indian--Arapahoe, isn't it, Monroe?--and I'm hoping blood will\ntell.\"\n\n\"Only trouble, Colonel,\" Monroe said slowly as he rose, \"is that I'm\none-_fourth_ Indian and even that.... Didn't I ever tell you that my\ngreat-grandfather was the only Arapahoe scout who was with Custer at the\nLittle Big Horn? He'd been positive Sitting Bull was miles away.\nHowever, I'll do my best. And if I heroically don't come back, would you\nplease persuade the Security Officer of our section to clear my name for\nuse in the history books? Under the circumstances, I think it's the\nleast he could do.\"\n\nI promised to do my best, of course.\n\n\n\nAfter he took off, I sat in the dome over the telephone connection to\nTom and hated myself for picking Monroe to do the job. But I'd have\nhated myself just as much for picking Tom. And if anything happened and\nI had to tell Tom to blast off, I'd probably be sitting here in the dome\nall by myself after that, waiting....\n\n\"_Broz neggle!_\" came over the radio in Monroe's resonant voice. He had\nlanded the single-seater.\n\nI didn't dare use the telephone to chat with Tom in the ship, for fear I\nmight miss an important word or phrase from our scout. So I sat and sat\nand strained my ears. After a while, I heard \"_Mishgashu!_\" which told\nme that Monroe was in the neighborhood of the other dome and was\ncreeping toward it under cover of whatever boulders were around.\n\nAnd then, abruptly, I heard Monroe yell my name and there was a terrific\nclattering in my headphones. Radio interference! He'd been caught, and\nwhoever had caught him had simultaneously jammed his suit transmitter\nwith a larger transmitter from the alien dome.\n\nThen there was silence.\n\nAfter a while, I told Tom what had happened. He just said, \"Poor\nMonroe.\" I had a good idea of what his expression was like.\n\n\"Look, Tom,\" I said, \"if you take off now, you still won't have anything\nimportant to tell. After capturing Monroe, whatever's in that other dome\nwill come looking for us, I think. I'll let them get close enough for us\nto learn something of their appearance--at least if they're human or\nnon-human. Any bit of information about them is important. I'll shout it\nup to you and you'll still be able to take off in plenty of time. All\nright?\"\n\n\"You're the boss, Colonel,\" he said in a mournful voice. \"Lots of luck.\"\n\nAnd then there was nothing to do but wait. There was no oxygen system in\nthe dome yet, so I had to squeeze up a sandwich from the food\ncompartment in my suit. I sat there, thinking about the expedition. Nine\nyears, and all that careful secrecy, all that expenditure of money and\nmind-cracking research--and it had come to this. Waiting to be wiped\nout, in a blast from some unimaginable weapon. I understood Monroe's\nlast request. We often felt we were so secret that our immediate\nsuperiors didn't even want us to know what we we were working on.\nScientists are people--they wish for recognition, too. I was hoping the\nwhole expedition would be written up in the history books, but it looked\nunpromising.\n\n\n\nTwo hours later, the scout ship landed near the dome. The lock opened\nand, from where I stood in the open door of our dome, I saw Monroe come\nout and walk toward me.\n\nI alerted Tom and told him to listen carefully. \"It may be a trick--he\nmight be drugged....\"\n\nHe didn't act drugged, though--not exactly. He pushed his way past me\nand sat down on a box to one side of the dome. He put his booted feet up\non another, smaller box.\n\n\"How are you, Ben?\" he asked. \"How's every little thing?\"\n\nI grunted. \"_Well?_\" I know my voice skittered a bit.\n\nHe pretended puzzlement. \"Well _what_? Oh, I see what you mean. The\nother dome--you want to know who's in it. You have a right to be\ncurious, Ben. Certainly. The leader of a top-secret expedition like\nthis--Project Hush they call us, huh, Ben--finds another dome on the\nMoon. He thinks he's been the first to land on it, so naturally he wants\nto--\"\n\n\"Major Monroe Gridley!\" I rapped out. \"You will come to attention and\ndeliver your report. Now!\" Honestly, I felt my neck swelling up inside\nmy helmet.\n\nMonroe just leaned back against the side of the dome. \"That's the _Army_\nway of doing things,\" he commented admiringly. \"Like the recruits say,\nthere's a right way, a wrong way and an Army way. Only there are other\nways, too.\" He chuckled. \"Lots of other ways.\"\n\n\"He's off,\" I heard Tom whisper over the telephone. \"Ben, Monroe has\ngone and blown his stack.\"\n\n\"They aren't extraterrestrials in the other dome, Ben,\" Monroe\nvolunteered in a sudden burst of sanity. \"No, they're human, all right,\nand from Earth. Guess _where_.\"\n\n\"I'll kill you,\" I warned him. \"I swear I'll kill you, Monroe. Where are\nthey from--Russia, China, Argentina?\"\n\nHe grimaced. \"What's so secret about those places? Go on!--guess again.\"\n\nI stared at him long and hard. \"The only place else--\"\n\n\"Sure,\" he said. \"You got it, Colonel. The other dome is owned and\noperated by the Navy. The goddam United States Navy!\"",
