Old-fashioned sofa, R.; table, C.,\n laid for breakfast. HARRY seated R. of table, eating; rocking-chair,\n R. C. SALLY seated, L., shelling peas or paring apples. Entrances, R.,\n L., and C._\n\n_Sally._ (_Singing._)\n\n      \u201cRoll on, silver moon,\n      Guide the traveller his way,\n  While the nightingale\u2019s song is in tune;\n      For I never, never more\n      With my true love shall stray\n  By the sweet, silver light of the moon.\u201d\n\n_Harry._ Beautiful, beautiful! \u201cThere\u2019s music in _that_ air.\u201d Now take\na fresh roll, and keep me company while I take another of your mother\u2019s\ndelicious fresh rolls.\n\n_Sally._ Making the sixth you have devoured before my eyes!\n\n_Harry._ Exactly. What a tribute to her cooking! She\u2019s the best bred\nwoman in the country. Her pies are miracles of skill; her rolls are\nrolls of honor; her golden butter is so sweet, it makes me sweet upon\nher.\n\n_Sally._ Well, I declare, Harry Holden, that\u2019s poetry!\n\n_Harry._ Is it? Then hereafter call me the poet of the breakfast table.\nMy lay shall be seconded with a fresh egg.\n\n_Sally._ Another? Land sakes! you think of nothing but eating.\n\n_Harry._ Exactly, when I\u2019m hungry. My hunger once appeased, I think of\nthis good farm--the broad fields, mowing, haying, the well-fed cattle,\nand sometimes, when I am _very_ hungry, I think of the time when I\nleaned over the fence, and gazed enchanted upon the pretty girl milking\nher cow--whose name was Sally.\n\n_Sally._ Eh--the cow?\n\n_Harry._ Now, Sally, don\u2019t destroy the poetry of my language.\n\n_Sally._ Don\u2019t be ungrammatical, Harry; and do stop talking nonsense.\n\n_Harry._ I will, for my breakfast is finished, and I can talk to you no\nlonger. I\u2019m off. (_Sings._)\n\n  \u201cFor to reap and to sow,\n  To plough and to mow,\n    And to be a farmer\u2019s boy.\u201d\n\n(_Rises._) Ah, I little dreamed, two years ago, when I was playing the\nfine gentleman at Squire Jordan\u2019s,--a city swell, up in the country\nhere on a vacation,--that I should soon become a farmer.\n\n_Sally._ Are you sorry it is so, Harry?\n\n_Harry._ (_Comes down, places a cricket beside SALLY, and\nsits on it._) Sorry, you gypsy, when it has made a man of me? No. It\nhas been my salvation. I have a fortune left me, and was in a fair way\nof squandering it in all the vices of the city; had acquired a taste\nfor hot suppers, fine wines, gambling, and all sorts of dissipation;\nwas on the high road to ruin, when some good angel sent me up here. I\nsaw you, and was saved.\n\n_Sally._ And you are perfectly contented with your situation?\n\n_Harry._ Well, no, I\u2019m not. In fact, I\u2019m getting very much dissatisfied.\n\n_Sally._ Not with me, Harry?\n\n_Harry._ With you? Bless your dear little heart! you\u2019re the only\nsatisfaction I have. When I asked the old gentleman--your father--to\ngive you to me, two years ago, he said, \u201cNo, young man. Though I\u2019ve no\ndoubt you love my Sally, you\u2019ve got too much money. You never worked a\nday in your life. Suppose your wealth should take to itself wings some\nday, what\u2019s to become of her? She shall be a farmer\u2019s wife, or die an\nold maid. You say you would die for her. Go to work, learn to run a\nfarm, bring out your muscle, get some color in that pale face, get rid\nof your vices, and then, if your money goes, you\u2019ve the power to earn a\nliving, and a smart wife to help you.\u201d\n\n_Sally._ That\u2019s just what he said, and \u2019twas good advice.\n\n_Harry._ It was, though I did not think so at the time. But I took it,\nhired out to him, and now thank my good fortune for the copy he set me.\n\n_Sally._ And everybody says there\u2019s not a more likely farmer in the\nneighborhood than you.\n\n_Harry._ Much obliged to everybody. But, Sally, I think your father is\na little selfish.\n\n_Sally._ Don\u2019t abuse father. He\u2019s the most generous man--\n\n_Harry._ I know. But I\u2019ve grown valuable to him. And now, when I ask\nhim to let me marry you, he \u201chems\u201d and \u201chaws,\u201d and says, \u201cDon\u2019t be in\na hurry. Have patience.\u201d He knows that the moment you are my wife, I\nshall pack up and be off; and that\u2019s what\u2019s the matter.\n\n_Sally._ It will all come right one of these days.\n\n_Harry._ I suppose it will. But it don\u2019t come right now. I tell you,\nSally, I\u2019m going to have an answer this very day, or to-morrow I\u2019m off.\n\n_Sally._ Off? And leave me?\n\n_Harry._ O, no. Take you with me. You love me--don\u2019t you, Sally?\n\n_Sally._ You know I do, Harry.\n\n_Harry._ Then marry me. I\u2019ll make you the happiest woman in the\nworld. I\u2019ll carry you to an elegant home, and scatter money in every\ndirection, to bring around you luxuries and enjoyments.\n\n_Sally._ No, Harry; I could enjoy nothing, leaving my father without\nhis consent. I have always tried to be a good daughter. He would be\nvery angry, should I disobey him, and no good fortune would follow me.\nNo, Harry. Be patient. There\u2019s a good time coming.\n\n_Harry._ Yes, it\u2019s always _coming_. But I shall ask his consent to-day.\n\n_Sally._ Do, Harry. I hope he\u2019ll say yes, for you deserve it. (_Puts\nher arm about his neck._)\n\n_Harry._ And you deserve the best husband in the world, you gypsy.\n(_Puts his arm round her waist, and kisses her._)\n\n                   _Enter JOHNNY, C._\n\n_Johnny._ Christopher Columbus! O, hokey! (_SALLY and\nHARRY jump up._) Did you hear it?\n\n_Sally._ Hear what? Why don\u2019t you frighten a body to death, and have\ndone with it!\n\n_Johnny._ Somebody fired off something close to my head. Blunderbuss, I\nguess. Did it hit you, Sally?\n\n_Sally._ I didn\u2019t hear anything.\n\n_Johnny._ Didn\u2019t you feel it? Must have hit yer right in the mouth.\nIt\u2019s awful red!\n\n_Harry._ Come, Johnny, there\u2019s enough of that. I don\u2019t like it.\n\n_Johnny._ Don\u2019t you, though? Thought you did. Seemed to take to it\nnat\u2019ral nuff. Where\u2019s dad?\n\n_Sally._ He is not up yet. (_Sits and resumes her work. HARRY\ngoes to chair, back, and takes up his hat._)\n\nJOHNNY. Guess he\u2019s kinder sleepy after his jaunt to the city\nyesterday. Guess the coppers are hot! O, won\u2019t he catch it?\n\nHARRY. Why, what\u2019s the matter?\n\nJOHNNY. Matter? Say, thought you was goin\u2019 down with me after\nthat woodchuck this mornin\u2019. Don\u2019t see what a feller wants to fool away\nhis time here with a gal for, when there\u2019s a woodchuck to be got so\nhandy.\n\n                       _Enter MRS. SOMERBY, L._\n\n_Mrs. S._ I\u2019ll woodchuck yer! (_Taking him by the ear._) What d\u2019 ye\nmean by keeping out er the way all the morning--hey?\n\n_Johnny._ O! Quit, now! You hurt!\n\n_Mrs. S._ Hope I do. You jest stir out er this room till I\u2019ve done with\nyer, if you dare! (_Sits in rocking-chair, and rocks violently._) Sakes\nalive! It\u2019s enough to drive one ravin\u2019 distracted! There\u2019s yer father\nsleeping like a log, and it\u2019s arter eight o\u2019clock! Where did you two\ncritters go yesterday--hey?\n\n_Johnny._ Went to the city, of course.\n\n_Mrs. S._ Yes, yer did go to the city with a load of live and dead\nstuff; and there\u2019s that man in there, with not a cent in his pocket to\nshow for it. He\u2019d a never got home at all if the brute in the shafts\nhadn\u2019t known more than the brute in the wagon. Drunk clean through!\n\n_Harry._ What! Has Mr. Somerby had another spree?\n\n_Mrs. S._ I should think he had! They come thicker and thicker.--You\nyoung one! you speak up, and tell me what you know \u2019bout it, quick!\n\n_Johnny._ Well, all I know, dad an\u2019 I went to market. He sold off\neverything, and then sent me down to Scudder\u2019s to git a new rake, and\nover to Jinks\u2019s for some sugar, and round to Stevens\u2019s to borry a\nscrew-driver, cos something got loose.\n\n_Mrs. S._ Somethin\u2019 got loose! I should think so!\n\n_Johnny._ Said he\u2019d wait till I come back. When I got back, he hadn\u2019t\nwaited; so I went tearin\u2019 round arter him. Man in a white hat said he\nsaw him goin\u2019 down onto the wharf to see the elephant; so I went down.\nBig crowd down there. They was a auctioneering off a lot of animals.\nLion, tiger, and monkeys--Jemimy!--by the dozen. Purty soon I spied\ndad. He was sprung.\n\n_Mrs. S._ Sprung? For the land sakes! what\u2019s that? Not overboard?\n\n_Johnny._ Sprung--over the bay.\n\n_Mrs. S._ Over the bay? Thought he was on the wharf. Now, don\u2019t yer\nlie, you young one!\n\n_Harry._ He means he was in liquor.\n\n_Mrs. S._ More likely liquor in him. Why don\u2019t you say he was drunk,\nand have done with it?\n\n_Johnny._ Well, he was pretty full; and when I got there, he was\nleanin\u2019 up agin a hogshead, and biddin\u2019 on an elephant.\n\n_Mrs. S._ On an elephant! Why, he might have broke his neck!\n\n_Johnny._ O, fush! He was a biddin\u2019 for the elephant. He offered a\nhundred dollars. But I didn\u2019t see it; so I jest took a hold er him,\nh\u2019isted him inter the wagon, and drove back to Stevens\u2019s. When I come\nout, the wagon and dad were out of sight, and I had to foot it ten\nmiles. So I jest crept inter the barn when I got here, and had a snooze\non the hay.\n\n_Mrs. S._ Dear me! what capers! Two or three times a year he has these\nsprees, and they cost a mint of money. There was apples and cider, hens\nand chickens, eggs and butter, all gone. Dear me, what will become of\nus? If there\u2019s anything in this world I detest, it\u2019s a toper!\n\n  [_Exit, L._\n\n_Sally._ Poor mother, she\u2019s in a fever of excitement. I\u2019ll try and get\nher to lie down.\n\n  [_Exit, L._\n\n_Johnny._ I say, Mr. Holden, it\u2019s purty hard sleddin\u2019 for marm--ain\u2019t\nit?\n\n_Harry._ It is, indeed, Johnny; and don\u2019t you make it any harder for\nher. Never touch a drop of liquor.\n\n_Johnny._ O, don\u2019t you fret about me. I feel bad enough to see dad on\nthese times. I\u2019m a purty rough boy, but it does make me feel mean to\nsee dad, who\u2019s such a smart old gent when he\u2019s sober, let himself out\nin this way. I\u2019ve never touched a drop of liquor, and you can bet your\nlife I never will.\n\n_Harry._ That\u2019s right, Johnny. Drinking is the meanest kind of\nenjoyment, and the dearest, too. I\u2019m going to try and reform the old\ngentleman.\n\n_Johnny._ Are you? Well, you\u2019ve got a big job.\n\n_Harry._ Perhaps not. His bidding for the elephant has given me an idea.\n\n_Johnny._ It gave me an idea he was purty far gone.\n\n_Harry._ Yes. We will make him believe he bought the elephant.\n\n_Johnny._ What good will that do?\n\n_Harry._ I think we\u2019ll turn the animal into a temperance lecturer. Come\nwith me. Let\u2019s see your mother and Sally, and arrange matters before\nyour father appears.\n\n_Johnny._ Yes. But I want ter go after the woodchuck.\n\n_Harry._ Never mind him now. We\u2019ve got bigger game--the elephant.\n\n  [_Exit, L._\n\n           _Enter, slowly, R., SILAS, with a razor in his\n                                hand._\n\n_Silas._ I\u2019m in an awful state. My hand shakes so I can\u2019t shave; my\nthroat is all on fire, my head splitting, and I feel mean enough to\nsteal. Wonder how I got home! Guess I\u2019ve been and made a fool of\nmyself. I ain\u2019t got a copper in my pocket; and I know when I sold out\nI had over a hundred dollars in my wallet. (_Takes out wallet._) Looks\nnow as though an elephant had stepped on it. An elephant? Seems to me I\nsaw one yesterday in teown. Jest remember biddin\u2019 for him at auction.\nLucky I didn\u2019t buy him. \u2019Twas that plaguy \u201cOttawa beer\u201d set me goin\u2019.\nWell, I s\u2019pose I shall catch it from the old lady. But it\u2019s none of her\nbusiness. \u2019Twas my sarse and my live stock, and I\u2019ve a right to jest\nwhat I please with it.\n\n                       _Enter MRS. SOMERBY, L._\n\n_Mrs. S._ Silas Somerby! are you a man, or are you a monster?\n\n_Silas._ Hey? Ha, ha! Yes, I don\u2019t look very spruce, that\u2019s a fact. The\nwater was cold, and the razor dull, and--and--\n\n_Mrs. S._ And your hand shakes so you can\u2019t shave. O, Silas, Silas! At\nyour time of life! I blush for you!\n\n_Silas._ O, bother, now! What are you frettin\u2019 \u2019bout? I ain\u2019t killed\nanybody, or robbed anybody\u2019s house--have I?\n\n_Mrs. S._ You\u2019ve done somethin\u2019 as bad. You\u2019ve been on a spree, and\nsquandered every cent you had in your pocket.\n\n_Silas._ S\u2019pose I did? Ain\u2019t a hard-working man a right to enjoy\nhimself once in a while, I\u2019d like to know? Now you jest shet up! I\u2019m\nthe master of this farm, and if I choose to show a liberal spirit once\nin a while, and help along trade by spreading a little cash about, it\nain\u2019t for you to holler and \u201cblush--\u201d\n\n_Mrs. S._ Silas Somerby!\n\n_Silas._ Shet up! if you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll harness up old Jack, and clear out.\n\n_Mrs. S._ For another spree? O, you wretch! ain\u2019t you ashamed of\nyourself, to set sich an example to the young uns? And that critter you\nsent home! Do you want us to be devoured?\n\n_Silas._ Critter! critter! What critter?\n\n_Mrs. S._ O, you know well enough; and I guess you\u2019ll find you\u2019ve made\na poor bargain this time. I always told you rum would be your ruin;\nand if you don\u2019t see the poorhouse staring you in the face afore night,\nI\u2019m very much mistaken.\n\n                           _Enter HARRY, L._\n\n_Silas._ What on airth are yer talking about? Are yer crazy, or have\nyer been drinking?\n\n_Harry._ (_Comes down between them._) Hush! not a word! We must not let\nanybody know you are in the house!\n\n_Silas._ Hey! what ails _you_? Got a touch of the old lady\u2019s complaint?\n\n_Harry._ Hush! Not so loud! We must be cautious. Sheriff Brown is\nlooking for you; but I\u2019ve put him off the scent.\n\n_Silas._ Then oblige me by putting me on it. What\u2019s the matter? Why is\nthe sheriff looking for me?\n\n_Harry._ Hush! Not so loud! It\u2019s all about _him_. (_Pointing over his\nleft shoulder._)\n\n_Silas._ Him! him! Consarn his picter! who is _him_?\n\n_Harry._ Hush! Not so loud! I\u2019ve got him locked up in the barn. He\ngot into the melon beds; they\u2019re gone: then into the cucumbers; he\u2019s\npickled them all. But I\u2019ve got him safe now.\n\n                          _Enter JOHNNY, L._\n\n_Johnny._ By Jinks! the critter\u2019s hauled the sleigh down from the\nrafters; broke it all to smash!\n\n                          _Enter SALLY, L._\n\n_Sally._ O, mother, he\u2019s stepped into your tub of eggs, and there ain\u2019t\na whole one left.\n\n_Mrs. S._ I told you so. O, Silas, how could you?\n\n_Silas._ Are you all crazy? Who has trampled the melons? Who has\npickled the cucumbers? Who has smashed the sleigh? And who has sucked\nthe eggs? I pause for a reply.\n\n_All._ (_In chorus._) Your elephant!\n\n_Silas._ My elephant? My elephant? Pooh! Nonsense! I don\u2019t own any such\ncritter.\n\n_Johnny._ Say, dad, have yer forgotten the auction yesterday--the\ntiger, and the monkey, and the elephant?\n\n_Silas._ What? Stop! O, my head! It must be so. Did I buy that elephant?\n\n_Harry._ He is in the barn, Mr. Somerby.\n\n_Silas._ I\u2019m a ruined man! (_Sinks into chair L. of table._)\nIs he alive?\n\n_Mrs. S._ He ought to be, with half a ton of hay inside him.\n\n_Silas._ O, my hay! my hay!\n\n_Johnny._ And a barrel of turnips.\n\n_Silas._ O, ruin! ruin!\n\n_Sally._ And a whole basket of carrots.\n\n_Silas._ I\u2019ll shoot him! I\u2019ll shoot him!\n\n_Johnny._ That\u2019s easier said than done, dad. Them critters die hard;\nand we ain\u2019t got the cannon to bombard him with.\n\n_Harry._ Come, Johnny, let\u2019s look after him. I\u2019m afraid he will get\ninto more mischief. Will you have a look at him, Mr. Somerby?\n\n_Silas._ Look at him? Never! Find me a way to get rid of him, quick!\n\n_Harry._ That\u2019s not such an easy matter. Nobody would take the gift of\nhim; and nobody but a fool would buy him.\n\n_Mrs. S._ That\u2019s a fact. O, my eggs! my eggs! Eighty dozen, all ready\nfor market!\n\n_Sally._ Law sakes! that elephant has made me forget the breakfast\nthings. (_Clears away the table, carrying things off, L._)\n\n_Harry._ I suppose you want him to have plenty of hay?\n\n_Silas._ (_Fiercely._) Feed him till he splits, or dies of indigestion!\n\n  [_Exit HARRY, L._\n\n_Johnny._ Say, dad, he\u2019ll be grand, if we can only put him to the\nplough.\n\n_Silas._ (_Fiercely._) Clear out, yer jackanapes!\n\n  [_Exit JOHNNY, L._\n\n_Mrs. S._ I\u2019ll go and look after the poultry. If he gets in among \u2019em,\ngood by to Thanksgiving. It\u2019s all right, Silas. It\u2019s a pretty big\ncritter to have about; but it shows \u201ca liberal spirit\u201d--don\u2019t it?\n\n  [_Exit, L._\n\n_Silas._ Shut up! Clear out!--Wal, I guess I brought home a pretty big\nload last night, accordin\u2019 to the looks of things. Now, what on airth\nset me on to buy that elephant? Must have been the Ottawa beer. What\non airth shall I do with him? He\u2019ll eat us out of house and home. If I\nkill him, there\u2019s an end of it. No, the beginnin\u2019, for we\u2019d have to dig\nup the whole farm to bury him. But he must be got rid of somehow. O,\nSomerby, you\u2019ve a long row to hoe here!\n\n                           _Enter HARRY, L._\n\n_Harry._ Now, sir, let us look this matter calmly in the face. (_Sits\nR. of table._)\n\n_Silas._ What matter?\n\n_Harry._ Well, suppose we call it \u201cconsequential damages.\u201d\n\n_Silas._ Call it what you like. It\u2019s a big critter, and should have a\nbig name.\n\n_Harry._ You don\u2019t understand me. I told you Sheriff Brown was looking\nfor you. There are about a dozen complaints lodged against you already.\nThis is likely to be a costly affair.\n\n_Silas._ Sheriff Brown--complaints--costly affair! Why, what do you\nmean? Isn\u2019t it bad enough to be caught with an elephant on your hands?\n\n_Harry._ Well, your elephant, not being acquainted in this part of\nthe country, got out of the road a little in travelling towards his\npresent quarters. For instance, he walked into Squire Brown\u2019s fence,\nand carried away about a rod of it.\n\n_Silas._ You don\u2019t mean it!\n\n_Harry._ And, in endeavoring to get back to the road, walked through\nhis glass house, and broke _some_ glass.\n\n_Silas._ Goodness gracious!\n\n_Harry._ Mr. Benson\u2019s flower garden, being near the road, was hastily\nvisited by his highness, and a few of the rare plants will flourish no\nmore.\n\n_Silas._ O, my head! Is that all?\n\n_Harry._ No, for Mrs. Carter was on the road with her span. On the\nappearance of the great hay-eater, one of the horses dropped dead.\n\n_Silas._ O, ruin, ruin! Why didn\u2019t the elephant keep him company?\n\n_Harry._ These parties have made complaint, and will sue you for\ndamages. There are other disasters connected with the entry of your\npet--\n\n_Silas._ Don\u2019t mention \u2019em. Don\u2019t speak of any more. There\u2019s enough now\nto ruin me. Broken fences, smashed hot-houses, ruined flower beds, and\na dead horse!\n\n_Harry._ Consequential damages.\n\n_Silas._ Consequential humbugs! I am the victim of a conspiracy. I\ndon\u2019t own an elephant. I won\u2019t own him. I never bought him. He\u2019s\nescaped from a menagerie. Why should I buy an elephant?\n\n_Harry._ That won\u2019t do, Mr. Somerby. You were seen at the auction; you\nwere heard to bid for the animal. I\u2019m afraid you will have to suffer.\n\n_Silas._ I won\u2019t pay a cent. They may drag me to jail, torture me with\ncold baths and hot irons; but not a cent will I pay for the capers of\nthat elephant.\n\n                        _Enter BIAS BLACK, L._\n\n_Bias._ Hay! What\u2019s dat? Am yer gwine to \u2019pudiate, Massa Somebody?\nGwine back on de ber--ber--bullephant--am yer?\n\n_Silas._ What\u2019s the matter with you, Bias Black?\n\n_Bias._ Wal, I speck a heap, Massa Somebody. Dat ar bullephant of\nyourn has driben dis indervideral inter bankrupturicy. Dar\u2019s been a\nreg\u2019lar smash up ob his commercial crisis, and de wabes ob affliction\nare rollin\u2019 into dis yer bussom.\n\n_Silas_. Now, yeou black imp, talk English, or walk Spanish, quick!\nWhat do yeou want?\n\n_Bias._ Want damages, heavy damages; dat\u2019s what I want, Massa Somebody.\n\n_Silas._ Damages for what?\n\n_Bias._ Wal, hold yer hush, an\u2019 I\u2019ll tell yer. Las\u2019 night I was gwine\nalong de road, see, wid my hoss and wagon chock full, an\u2019 ole Missey\nPearson sittin\u2019 alongside ob me--picked her up in de road. Pore ole\nlady! Guess she won\u2019t ax any more rides! An\u2019 jes\u2019 when I got by Square\nJones\u2019s door, den dar was an airthquake, by golly! Somethin\u2019 took right\nhole ob de tail-board. Felt somethin\u2019 h\u2019ist. Knowed \u2019twas a shock; and\nde nex\u2019 ting I knowed, I was up in a tree! Missey Pearson was h\u2019isted\nonto de fence, an\u2019 dat ar bullephant was a chasin\u2019 dat ar hoss ober de\nwagon, an\u2019 a trampin\u2019 round an\u2019 chawin\u2019 up things fine, I tell yer.\nGolly! such a mess! Dat\u2019s what de matter. Lost eberyting. Wouldn\u2019t a\ntaken sebenty-five dollars for dat ar wagon. An\u2019 dat ole lady, guess\nshe\u2019s shook all to pieces.\n\n_Silas._ And you expect me to pay for this!\n\n_Bias._ Ob course, ob course. If old gents will sow dar wild oats wid\nbullephants, dey must expect to pay for de thrashin\u2019. Sebenty-five\ndollars for de wagon, sixty-seben dollars and ninepence for de goods,\nan\u2019 about fifty dollars for de scare to dat pore ole hoss. I\u2019ll trow de\nole lady in.\n\n_Silas._ I\u2019ll throw yeou inter the horse-pond, yeou black imp! Not a\ndollar will yeou get from me.\n\n_Bias._ Hey! You won\u2019t pay? Den I\u2019ll hab de law. Yes, sir. I\u2019ll hab\na jury set onto you, an\u2019--, an\u2019--an\u2019--a judge, and two or three\nhabus corpuses. You can\u2019t fool dis chile. Dar want no muzzle on de\nbullephant, an\u2019 it\u2019s agin de law.\n\n_Silas._ Well, go to law. I shan\u2019t pay a cent.\n\n                        _Enter PAT MURPHY, L._\n\n_Pat._ Where\u2019s the kaper of the brute, I\u2019d like to know? Where\u2019s the\nhathin that sinds wild bastes a rarin\u2019 an\u2019 a tarin\u2019 into the paceful\nquarthers of the globe?\n\n_Silas_. What\u2019s the matter with yeou, Pat Murphy?\n\n_Pat._ Aha, owld gint, \u2019tis there ye are. It\u2019s a mighty foine scrape\nyer in this time, wid yer drinkin\u2019 an\u2019 rollickin\u2019.\n\n_Silas._ Come, come, Pat Murphy, keep a civil tongue in your head.\n\n_Pat._ O, blarney! It\u2019s an ondacent man ye are, by me sowl! Wasn\u2019t I\nsittin\u2019 on my own doorstep last night, a smokin\u2019 my pipe genteelly, wid\nde childers innercently amusin\u2019 theirselves a throwin\u2019 brickbats at\none another, an\u2019 Biddy a washin\u2019 in the yard (as beautiful a picture\nof domestic felicity as ye don\u2019t often say), when an oogly black snout\nkim over the fence, an\u2019, afore ye could spake, away wint the fence, an\u2019\naway wint Biddy into the tub, an\u2019 the childers into the pig-pen, an\u2019\nmesilf ilevated to the top of the woodshed by that same oogly black\nbaste!\n\n_Harry._ Ah, the elephant on another frolic!\n\n_Pat._ Frolic--is it? Bedad, it must be paid for, ony how. An\u2019 so,\nowld gint, I\u2019ll jist throuble yez for the damages--to mesilf, a broken\nconstitution, Biddy, a wake\u2019s washin\u2019 intirely spoiled, and the\nchilders, bliss their dirthy faces! for a scare, an\u2019 the fright to the\npig, an\u2019 the broken fence. Come down, owld gint. Them as jig must pay\nthe piper.\n\n_Bias._ Das a fac\u2019, das a fac\u2019. Down wid de dust, ole gint, for de dust\ndat ar bullephant kicked up.\n\n_Silas._ Never! Not a cent! Get out of my house! You\u2019re a pair of\nknaves. There is no elephant about here. It\u2019s all a lie. I won\u2019t be\nswindled. Get out, I say!\n\n_Pat._ Knave! Look to yersilf, owld gint. It\u2019s not dacent for the likes\nof yez to call names. A lie? Troth, I\u2019ll jist bring Biddy and the\nchilder to tistify to the truth--so I will.\n\n_Silas._ Shut up! Clear out! If you want damages, you can have them.\nI\u2019m getting my dander up, and shall sartinly damage both of yer.\n\n_Bias._ Don\u2019t you do it, don\u2019t you do it. De law will fix you, old gent.\n\n_Pat._ Begorra, I\u2019ll spind me intire fortune, but I\u2019ll have justice.\n\n_Silas._ Are you going?\n\n_Pat._ To a lawyer, straight. I blush for yez, owld gint, I blush for\nyez.\n\n  [_Exit, L._\n\n_Bias._ Dat ar wagon, and dat ar hoss, and dem ar goods, and de ole\nlady must be repaired. So de law will tell yez, Massa Somebody. Das a\nfac\u2019, das a fac\u2019.\n\n  [_Exit, L._\n\n_Harry._ This looks like a serious business, Mr. Somerby.\n\n_Silas._ Confound it, so it does! What can I do? Must I pay all these\ndamages?\n\n_Harry._ I see no way for you to escape.\n\n_Silas._ What a fool I have been! For a few hours\u2019 fun I\u2019ve got myself\ninto this scrape. Why, \u2019twill ruin me. I can never raise the money.\n\n_Harry._ O, yes, you can, Mr. Somerby. I have plenty. You\u2019d better\nsettle this matter at once, and draw on me freely for money.\n\n_Silas._ Draw on you? What right have I to do that?\n\n_Harry._ Give your consent to my marriage with Sally, and I shall\nconsider you have the right. More, I will hunt up these claims, and\nsettle them at once.\n\n_Silas._ Will you? You\u2019re a splendid fellow! Help me out, if you can;\nand, if I can get rid of that elephant--\n\n_Harry._ On one condition I will take him off your hands.\n\n_Silas._ Take him off my hands? Name your condition.\n\n_Harry._ That you will give me your solemn promise never to touch\nliquor again.\n\n_Silas._ What! Give up my freedom?\n\n_Harry._ No; _be_ free. You are now the slave of an old custom, \u201cmore\nhonored in the breach than the observance.\u201d Don\u2019t let it master you\nagain. Don\u2019t let my wife blush for her father.\n\n_Silas._ I won\u2019t! There\u2019s my hand. Sally is yours; and I solemnly\npromise never to break (_smash of crockery, L._)--Hullo!\nWhat\u2019s that?\n\n_Mrs. S._ (_Outside, L._) O, the monster! Drive him out!\n\n_Sally._ (_Outside, L._) He won\u2019t go. Run, mother, run!\n(_Crash._)\n\n_Mrs. S._ (_Outside, L._) He\u2019s sp\u2019ilt my best dishes! O, the\nbeast! (_Enter, L._) O, Silas, this is all your work. That\nhateful critter\u2019s got into the kitchen.\n\n                           _Enter SALLY, L._\n\n_Sally._ O, mother! Harry! father! He\u2019s coming this way! Save us, save\nus! (_Gets under table._)\n\n_Mrs. S._ Goodness gracious! he\u2019ll set the house afire! (_Gets behind\nsofa._)\n\n                          _Enter JOHNNY, L._\n\n_Johnny._ Help! murder! O, I\u2019ve had a h\u2019ist! He\u2019s breaking up\nhousekeeping--you bet!\n\n_Harry._ Be calm, be calm. There\u2019s no danger.\n\n_Mrs. S._ We shall all be eaten alive. O, the monster!\n\n_Silas._ Confound him, I\u2019ll pepper him! Let me get my gun! (_Going,\nR._)\n\n_Harry._ No, no. \u2019Twould be dangerous to shoot.\n\n_Johnny._ Let him have a dose, dad.\n\n_Harry._ No, no. Silence! He\u2019s here!\n\n _Enter, L., PAT and BIAS, as the elephant. [For description of its\n manufacture, see note on page 92.] It enters slowly, passes across\n stage at back, and exit, R._\n\n_Mrs. S._ O, the monster!\n\n_Sally._ He\u2019s gone straight into the parlor. He\u2019ll smash everything. O,\nmy vases, my vases!\n\n_Silas._ (_Aside._) Confound the critter, I\u2019ll have one shot at him.\n\n  [_Exit, R._\n\n_Harry._ (_To SALLY._) It\u2019s all right, Sally. I\u2019ve got his\npromise.\n\n_Sally._ And we shall be married! Ain\u2019t it jolly?\n\n_Mrs. S._ But how on airth are you going to git out of this scrape?\n\n_Harry._ Leave that to me. Hush! he\u2019s here.\n\n                     _Enter SILAS, R., with gun._\n\n_Silas._ I\u2019ve had jest about enough of that air critter\u2019s society; and\nif I don\u2019t pepper him, my name\u2019s not Silas Somerby.\n\n_Harry._ A gun! (_Aside._) This will never do. (_Aloud._) Mr. Somerby,\nyour life\u2019s in danger if you fire that gun.\n\n_Silas._ My dander\u2019s up, and I\u2019m goin\u2019 in.\n\n_Mrs. S._ Silas, don\u2019t you shoot off that gun. I can\u2019t bear it.\n\n_Sally._ No, no, father; you must not.\n\n_Johnny._ Don\u2019t mind \u2019em, dad; blaze away. (_Aside._) By jinks, that\u2019ll\nbe fun! (_They all come forward._)\n\n_Silas._ I\u2019m going to have a shot at the critter, if I die for it. Here\nhe comes again. (_Raises gun._)\n\n_Mrs. S._ Mercy sakes, Silas, you\u2019ll kill somebody!\n\n_Harry._ You must not shoot, I tell you!\n\n_Sally._ O, father, don\u2019t! Please don\u2019t! (_They all seize him._)\n\n_Johnny._ Blaze away, dad! Give him fits!\n\n_Silas._ (_Breaking away from them._) Stand back, I say. (_Raises gun._)\n\n                       _Enter the elephant, R._\n\n_Silas._ There, darn you! (_Fires. SALLY and MRS. S. scream._)\n\n_Pat._ O, murther, murther! I\u2019m kilt intirely!\n\n_Bias._ Oo, oo, oo! I\u2019m a gone darky! (_The elephant falls, rolls over,\nand from the debris BIAS and PAT emerge, looking very much frightened._)\n\n_Pat._ (_Shaking his fist at SILAS._) More damages, be jabers!\n(_To HARRY._) I didn\u2019t bargain for this at all.\n\n_Bias._ Look--look er here, old gent; I ain\u2019t game, no how. Golly! I\u2019m\nfull ob lead!\n\n_Silas._ What\u2019s this? Have I been duped?\n\n_Johnny._ Sold again, dad.\n\n_Silas._ So, so, you\u2019ve been conspiring against me. There\u2019s no damages,\nand no elephant. This is your work, Harry Holden.\n\n_Harry._ It is, Mr. Somerby. I freely confess my sin. But I did it for\na good purpose. \u2019Tis true there is no elephant, save the imitation I\nhave manufactured for the occasion; but please remember we came very\nnear having one.\n\n_Johnny._ Yes, dad, you bid a hundred dollars.\n\n_Silas._ I breathe again. You\u2019re right. All this might have been\ntrue, had my folly had its way. Thanks to Johnny, I was saved. But you\ncarried the joke a little too far. That gun was loaded.\n\n_Johnny._ Only with powder. I left a charge in it last Fourth, for the\nblamed thing kicked so I was afraid of it.\n\n_Silas._ It\u2019s all right. Sally is yours, Harry, and I\u2019ll keep my other\npromise. I suppose these gentlemen were hired for the occasion.\n\n_Pat._ By me sowl, not to be peppered at all, at all.\n\n_Bias._ By golly, dat ar charge almost took away my head.\n\n_Harry._ So, boys, you got a little more than you bargained for; but\nI\u2019ll fix that all right.\n\n_Silas._ I\u2019ll pay all damages there, glad to get off so easily in my\nadventure with the elephant. I\u2019ve one request to make. Don\u2019t let this\nstory spread.\n\n_Harry._ You can rely upon my silence.\n\n_Mrs. S._ Marcy sakes, Silas, it ain\u2019t much to boast on!\n\n_Sally._ It shall be a family legend.\n\n_Pat._ Be jabers, I wouldn\u2019t blab till I was deaf and dumb!\n\n_Bias._ Dis yer pusson can hold his hush.\n\n_Silas._ Thank you. And you (_to audience_), can I depend upon you? The\nold man begins late, but he is bound to reform; and, if you but give\nyour approbation, there is no fear of his backsliding.\n\n_Johnny._ I say, dad, hadn\u2019t you better put a postscript to that?\n\n_Silas._ Well, what is-- (_JOHNNY whispers to him._) Exactly.\nThere is no fear of his backsliding, unless, at your request, he\nshould some time set out for the purpose of \u201cSeeing the Elephant.\u201d\n\n NOTE. _The Elephant._ For this trick a well-known comical\n diversion can be introduced. Bias and Pat personate the elephant; one\n represents the fore, the other the hind legs. The two characters bend\n over, placing themselves one behind the other, as represented in the\n engraving. A blanket, doubled three or four times, is placed on their\n backs, with the addition of long cushions, if handy; these serve to\n form the back of the elephant. Two blankets or shawls are placed over\n this, the end of one twisted to represent his trunk, the end of the\n other twisted to represent his tail. Two paper cones enact the tusks,\n and the elephant is complete.\n\n\n\n\nSPENCER\u2019S UNIVERSAL STAGE.\n\n_A Collection of COMEDIES, DRAMAS, and FARCES, adapted to either Public\nor Private Performance.
