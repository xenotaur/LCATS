But in writing to amuse, if I fail,\nthe only evil is in my own disappointment. If, however, I can by any\nlucky chance, in these days of evil, rub out one wrinkle from the brow\nof care, or beguile the heavy heart of one moment of sorrow; if I can\nnow and then penetrate through the gathering film of misanthropy, prompt\na benevolent view of human nature, and make my reader more in good\nhumour with his fellow-beings and himself, surely, surely, I shall not\nthen have written entirely in vain.",
