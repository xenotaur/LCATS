Co., Inc._\n\n\n\n\nA Classic Reprint from AMAZING STORIES, June, 1926\n\nIntroduction by Sam Moskowitz\n\n\n_One of the gravest editorial problems faced by the editors of AMAZING\nSTORIES when they launched its first issue, dated April, 1926, was the\nproblem of finding or developing authors who could write the type of\nstory they needed. As a stop-gap, the first two issues of AMAZING\nSTORIES were devoted entirely to reprints. But reprints were to\nconstitute a declining portion of the publication's contents for the\nfollowing four years. The first new story the magazine bought was\n_Coming of the Ice_, by G. Peyton Wertenbaker, which appeared in its\nthird issue. Wertenbaker was not technically a newcomer to science\nfiction, since he had sold his first story to Gernsback's SCIENCE AND\nINVENTION, _The Man From the Atom_, in 1923 when he was only 16! Now, at\nthe ripe old age of 19, he was appearing in the world's first truly\ncomplete science fiction magazine._\n\n_The scope of his imagination was truly impressive and, despite the\nauthor's youth, _Coming of the Ice_ builds to a climax of considerable\npower._\n\n_Wertenbaker, under the name of Green Peyton, went on to sell his first\nnovel, _Black Cabin_, in 1933. He eventually became an authority on the\nSouthwest with many regional volumes to his credit: _For God and Texas_,\n_America's Heartland_, _The Southwest_, and _San Antonio, City of the\nSun_. But he never lost his interest in space travel, assisting Hubertus\nStrughold on the writing of _The Green and Red Planet_, a scientific\nappraisal of the possibilities of life on the planet Mars published in\n1953. He also served for a time as London correspondent for FORTUNE\nMAGAZINE._\n\n\n\n\nIt is strange to be alone, and so cold. To be the last man on earth....\n\nThe snow drives silently about me, ceaselessly, drearily. And I am\nisolated in this tiny white, indistinguishable corner of a blurred\nworld, surely the loneliest creature in the universe. How many thousands\nof years is it since I last knew the true companionship? For a long time\nI have been lonely, but there were people, creatures of flesh and blood.\nNow they are gone. Now I have not even the stars to keep me company, for\nthey are all lost in an infinity of snow and twilight here below.\n\nIf only I could know how long it has been since first I was imprisoned\nupon the earth. It cannot matter now. And yet some vague\ndissatisfaction, some faint instinct, asks over and over in my throbbing\nears: What year? What year?\n\nIt was in the year 1930 that the great thing began in my life. There was\nthen a very great man who performed operations on his fellows to compose\ntheir vitals--we called such men surgeons. John Granden wore the title\n\"Sir\" before his name, in indication of nobility by birth according to\nthe prevailing standards in England. But surgery was only a hobby of Sir\nJohn's, if I must be precise, for, while he had achieved an enormous\nreputation as a surgeon, he always felt that his real work lay in the\nexperimental end of his profession. He was, in a way, a dreamer, but a\ndreamer who could make his dreams come true.\n\nI was a very close friend of Sir John's. In fact, we shared the same\napartments in London. I have never forgotten that day when he first\nmentioned to me his momentous discovery. I had just come in from a long\nsleigh-ride in the country with Alice, and I was seated drowsily in the\nwindow-seat, writing idly in my mind a description of the wind and the\nsnow and the grey twilight of the evening. It is strange, is it not,\nthat my tale should begin and end with the snow and the twilight.\n\nSir John opened suddenly a door at one end of the room and came hurrying\nacross to another door. He looked at me, grinning rather like a\ntriumphant maniac.\n\n\"It's coming!\" he cried, without pausing, \"I've almost got it!\" I smiled\nat him: he looked very ludicrous at that moment.\n\n\"What have you got?\" I asked.\n\n\"Good Lord, man, the Secret--the Secret!\" And then he was gone again,\nthe door closing upon his victorious cry, \"The Secret!\"\n\nI was, of course, amused. But I was also very much interested. I knew\nSir John well enough to realize that, however amazing his appearance\nmight be, there would be nothing absurd about his \"Secret\"--whatever it\nwas. But it was useless to speculate. I could only hope for\nenlightenment at dinner. So I immersed myself in one of the surgeon's\nvolumes from his fine Library of Imagination, and waited.\n\nI think the book was one of Mr. H. G. Wells', probably \"The Sleeper\nAwakes,\" or some other of his brilliant fantasies and predictions, for I\nwas in a mood conducive to belief in almost anything when, later, we sat\ndown together across the table. I only wish I could give some idea of\nthe atmosphere that permeated our apartments, the reality it lent to\nwhatever was vast and amazing and strange. You could then, whoever you\nare, understand a little the ease with which I accepted Sir John's new\ndiscovery.\n\nHe began to explain it to me at once, as though he could keep it to\nhimself no longer.\n\n\"Did you think I had gone mad, Dennell?\" he asked. \"I quite wonder that\nI haven't. Why, I have been studying for many years--for most of my\nlife--on this problem. And, suddenly, I have solved it! Or, rather, I am\nafraid I have solved another one much greater.\"\n\n\"Tell me about it, but for God's sake don't be technical.\"\n\n\"Right,\" he said. Then he paused. \"Dennell, it's _magnificent_! It will\nchange everything that is in the world.\" His eyes held mine suddenly\nwith the fatality of a hypnotist's. \"Dennell, it is the Secret of\nEternal Life,\" he said.\n\n\"Good Lord, Sir John!\" I cried, half inclined to laugh.\n\n\"I mean it,\" he said. \"You know I have spent most of my life studying\nthe processes of birth, trying to find out precisely what went on in the\nwhole history of conception.\"\n\n\"You have found out?\"\n\n\"No, that is just what amuses me. I have discovered something else\nwithout knowing yet what causes either process.\n\n\"I don't want to be technical, and I know very little of what actually\ntakes place myself. But I can try to give you some idea of it.\"\n\n\n\nIt is thousands, perhaps millions of years since Sir John explained to\nme. What little I understood at the time I may have forgotten, yet I try\nto reproduce what I can of his theory.\n\n\"In my study of the processes of birth,\" he began, \"I discovered the\nrudiments of an action which takes place in the bodies of both men and\nwomen. There are certain properties in the foods we eat that remain in\nthe body for the reproduction of life, two distinct Essences, so to\nspeak, of which one is retained by the woman, another by the man. It is\nthe union of these two properties that, of course, creates the child.\n\n\"Now, I made a slight mistake one day in experimenting with a\nguinea-pig, and I re-arranged certain organs which I need not describe\nso that I thought I had completely messed up the poor creature's\nabdomen. It lived, however, and I laid it aside. It was some years later\nthat I happened to notice it again. It had not given birth to any young,\nbut I was amazed to note that it had apparently grown no older: it\nseemed precisely in the same state of growth in which I had left it.\n\n\"From that I built up. I re-examined the guinea-pig, and observed it\ncarefully. I need not detail my studies. But in the end I found that my\n'mistake' had in reality been a momentous discovery. I found that I had\nonly to close certain organs, to re-arrange certain ducts, and to open\ncertain dormant organs, and, _mirabile dictu_, the whole process of\nreproduction was changed.\n\n\"You have heard, of course, that our bodies are continually changing,\nhour by hour, minute by minute, so that every few years we have been\nliterally reborn. Some such principle as this seems to operate in\nreproduction, except that, instead of the old body being replaced by the\nnew, and in its form, approximately, the new body is created apart from\nit. It is the creation of children that causes us to die, it would seem,\nbecause if this activity is, so to speak, dammed up or turned aside into\nnew channels, the reproduction operates on the old body, renewing it\ncontinually. It is very obscure and very absurd, is it not? But the most\nabsurd part of it is that it is true. Whatever the true explanation may\nbe, the fact remains that the operation can be done, that it actually\nprolongs life indefinitely, and that I alone know the secret.\"\n\nSir John told me a very great deal more, but, after all, I think it\namounted to little more than this. It would be impossible for me to\nexpress the great hold his discovery took upon my mind the moment he\nrecounted it. From the very first, under the spell of his personality, I\nbelieved, and I knew he was speaking the truth. And it opened up before\nme new vistas. I began to see myself become suddenly eternal, never\nagain to know the fear of death. I could see myself storing up, century\nafter century, an amplitude of wisdom and experience that would make me\ntruly a god.\n\n\"Sir John!\" I cried, long before he was finished. \"You must perform that\noperation on me!\"\n\n\"But, Dennell, you are too hasty. You must not put yourself so rashly\ninto my hands.\"\n\n\"You have perfected the operation, haven't you?\"\n\n\"That is true,\" he said.\n\n\"You must try it out on somebody, must you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course. And yet--somehow, Dennell, I am afraid. I cannot help\nfeeling that man is not yet prepared for such a vast thing. There are\nsacrifices. One must give up love and all sensual pleasure. This\noperation not only takes away the mere fact of reproduction, but it\ndeprives one of all the things that go with sex, all love, all sense of\nbeauty, all feeling for poetry and the arts. It leaves only the few\nemotions, selfish emotions, that are necessary to self-preservation. Do\nyou not see? One becomes an intellect, nothing more--a cold apotheosis\nof reason. And I, for one, cannot face such a thing calmly.\"\n\n\"But, Sir John, like many fears, it is largely horrible in the\nforesight. After you have changed your nature you cannot regret it. What\nyou are would be as horrible an idea to you afterwards as the thought of\nwhat you will be seems now.\"\n\n\"True, true. I know it. But it is hard to face, nevertheless.\"\n\n\"I am not afraid to face it.\"\n\n\"You do not understand it, Dennell, I am afraid. And I wonder whether\nyou or I or any of us on this earth are ready for such a step. After\nall, to make a race deathless, one should be sure it is a perfect race.\"\n\n\"Sir John,\" I said, \"it is not you who have to face this, nor any one\nelse in the world till you are ready. But I am firmly resolved, and I\ndemand it of you as my friend.\"\n\nWell, we argued much further, but in the end I won. Sir John promised to\nperform the operation three days later.\n\n... But do you perceive now what I had forgotten during all that\ndiscussion, the one thing I had thought I could never forget so long as\nI lived, not even for an instant? It was my love for Alice--I had\nforgotten that!\n\n\n\nI cannot write here all the infinity of emotions I experienced later,\nwhen, with Alice in my arms, it suddenly came upon me what I had done.\nAges ago--I have forgotten how to feel. I could name now a thousand\nfeelings I used to have, but I can no longer even understand them. For\nonly the heart can understand the heart, and the intellect only the\nintellect.\n\nWith Alice in my arms, I told the whole story. It was she who, with her\nquick instinct, grasped what I had never noticed.\n\n\"But Carl!\" she cried, \"Don't you see?--It will mean that we can never\nbe married!\" And, for the first time, I understood. If only I could\nre-capture some conception of that love! I have always known, since the\nlast shred of comprehension slipped from me, that I lost something very\nwonderful when I lost love. But what does it matter? I lost Alice too,\nand I could not have known love again without her.\n\nWe were very sad and very tragic that night. For hours and hours we\nargued the question over. But I felt somewhat that I was inextricably\ncaught in my fate, that I could not retreat now from my resolve. I was\nperhaps, very school-boyish, but I felt that it would be cowardice to\nback out now. But it was Alice again who perceived a final aspect of the\nmatter.\n\n\"Carl,\" she said to me, her lips very close to mine, \"it need not come\nbetween our love. After all, ours would be a poor sort of love if it\nwere not more of the mind than of the flesh. We shall remain lovers, but\nwe shall forget mere carnal desire. I shall submit to that operation\ntoo!\"\n\nAnd I could not shake her from her resolve. I would speak of danger that\nI could not let her face. But, after the fashion of women, she disarmed\nme with the accusation that I did not love her, that I did not want her\nlove, that I was trying to escape from love. What answer had I for that,\nbut that I loved her and would do anything in the world not to lose her?\n\nI have wondered sometimes since whether we might have known the love of\nthe mind. Is love something entirely of the flesh, something created by\nan ironic God merely to propagate His race? Or can there be love without\nemotion, love without passion--love between two cold intellects? I do\nnot know. I did not ask then. I accepted anything that would make our\nway more easy.\n\nThere is no need to draw out the tale. Already my hand wavers, and my\ntime grows short. Soon there will be no more of me, no more of my\ntale--no more of Mankind. There will be only the snow, and the ice, and\nthe cold ...\n\n\n\nThree days later I entered John's Hospital with Alice on my arm. All my\naffairs--and they were few enough--were in order. I had insisted that\nAlice wait until I had come safely through the operation, before she\nsubmitted to it. I had been carefully starved for two days, and I was\nlost in an unreal world of white walls and white clothes and white\nlights, drunk with my dreams of the future. When I was wheeled into the\noperating room on the long, hard table, for a moment it shone with\nbrilliant distinctness, a neat, methodical white chamber, tall and more\nor less circular. Then I was beneath the glare of soft white lights, and\nthe room faded into a misty vagueness from which little steel rays\nflashed and quivered from silvery cold instruments. For a moment our\nhands, Sir John's and mine, gripped, and we were saying good-bye--for a\nlittle while--in the way men say these things. Then I felt the warm\ntouch of Alice's lips upon mine, and I felt sudden painful things I\ncannot describe, that I could not have described then. For a moment I\nfelt that I must rise and cry out that I could not do it. But the\nfeeling passed, and I was passive.\n\nSomething was pressed about my mouth and nose, something with an\nethereal smell. Staring eyes swam about me from behind their white\nmasks. I struggled instinctively, but in vain--I was held securely.\nInfinitesimal points of light began to wave back and forth on a\npitch-black background; a great hollow buzzing echoed in my head. My\nhead seemed suddenly to have become all throat, a great, cavernous,\nempty throat in which sounds and lights were mingled together, in a\nswift rhythm, approaching, receding eternally. Then, I think, there were\ndreams. But I have forgotten them....\n\nI began to emerge from the effect of the ether. Everything was dim, but\nI could perceive Alice beside me, and Sir John.\n\n\"Bravely done!\" Sir John was saying, and Alice, too, was saying\nsomething, but I cannot remember what. For a long while we talked, I\nspeaking the nonsense of those who are coming out from under ether, they\nteasing me a little solemnly. But after a little while I became aware of\nthe fact that they were about to leave. Suddenly, God knows why, I knew\nthat they must not leave. Something cried in the back of my head that\nthey _must_ stay--one cannot explain these things, except by after\nevents. I began to press them to remain, but they smiled and said they\nmust get their dinner. I commanded them not to go; but they spoke kindly\nand said they would be back before long. I think I even wept a little,\nlike a child, but Sir John said something to the nurse, who began to\nreason with me firmly, and then they were gone, and somehow I was\nasleep....\n\n\n\nWhen I awoke again, my head was fairly clear, but there was an\nabominable reek of ether all about me. The moment I opened my eyes, I\nfelt that something had happened. I asked for Sir John and for Alice. I\nsaw a swift, curious look that I could not interpret come over the face\nof the nurse, then she was calm again, her countenance impassive. She\nreassured me in quick meaningless phrases, and told me to sleep. But I\ncould not sleep: I was absolutely sure that something had happened to\nthem, to my friend and to the woman I loved. Yet all my insistence\nprofited me nothing, for the nurses were a silent lot. Finally, I think,\nthey must have given me a sleeping potion of some sort, for I fell\nasleep again.\n\nFor two endless, chaotic days, I saw nothing of either of them, Alice or\nSir John. I became more and more agitated, the nurse more and more\ntaciturn. She would only say that they had gone away for a day or two.\n\nAnd then, on the third day, I found out. They thought I was asleep. The\nnight nurse had just come in to relieve the other.\n\n\"Has he been asking about them again?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes, poor fellow. I have hardly managed to keep him quiet.\"\n\n\"We will have to keep it from him until he is recovered fully.\" There\nwas a long pause, and I could hardly control my labored breathing.\n\n\"How sudden it was!\" one of them said. \"To be killed like that--\" I\nheard no more, for I leapt suddenly up in bed, crying out.\n\n\"Quick! For God's sake, tell me what has happened!\" I jumped to the\nfloor and seized one of them by the collar. She was horrified. I shook\nher with a superhuman strength.\n\n\"Tell me!\" I shouted, \"Tell me--Or I'll--!\" She told me--what else could\nshe do.\n\n\"They were killed in an accident,\" she gasped, \"in a taxi--a\ncollision--the Strand--!\" And at that moment a crowd of nurses and\nattendants arrived, called by the other frantic woman, and they put me\nto bed again.\n\nI have no memory of the next few days. I was in delirium, and I was\nnever told what I said during my ravings. Nor can I express the feelings\nI was saturated with when at last I regained my mind again. Between my\nold emotions and any attempt to put them into words, or even to remember\nthem, lies always that insurmountable wall of my Change. I cannot\nunderstand what I must have felt, I cannot express it.\n\nI only know that for weeks I was sunk in a misery beyond any misery I\nhad ever imagined before. The only two friends I had on earth were gone\nto me. I was left alone. And, for the first time, I began to see before\nme all these endless years that would be the same, dull, lonely.\n\nYet I recovered. I could feel each day the growth of a strange new vigor\nin my limbs, a vast force that was something tangibly expressive to\neternal life. Slowly my anguish began to die. After a week more, I began\nto understand how my emotions were leaving me, how love and beauty and\neverything of which poetry was made--how all this was going. I could not\nbear the thought at first. I would look at the golden sunlight and the\nblue shadow of the wind, and I would say,\n\n\"God! How beautiful!\" And the words would echo meaninglessly in my ears.\nOr I would remember Alice's face, that face I had once loved so\ninextinguishably, and I would weep and clutch my forehead, and clench my\nfists, crying,\n\n\"O God, how can I live without her!\" Yet there would be a little strange\nfancy in my head at the same moment, saying,\n\n\"Who is this Alice? You know no such person.\" And truly I would wonder\nwhether she had ever existed.\n\nSo, slowly, the old emotions were shed away from me, and I began to joy\nin a corresponding growth of my mental perceptions. I began to toy idly\nwith mathematical formulae I had forgotten years ago, in the same\nfashion that a poet toys with a word and its shades of meaning. I would\nlook at everything with new, seeing eyes, new perception, and I would\nunderstand things I had never understood before, because formerly my\nemotions had always occupied me more than my thoughts.\n\nAnd so the weeks went by, until, one day, I was well.\n\n... What, after all, is the use of this chronicle? Surely there will\nnever be men to read it. I have heard them say that the snow will never\ngo. I will be buried, it will be buried with me; and it will be the end\nof us both. Yet, somehow, it eases my weary soul a little to write....\n\nNeed I say that I lived, thereafter, many thousands of thousands of\nyears, until this day? I cannot detail that life. It is a long round of\nnew, fantastic impressions, coming dream-like, one after another,\nmelting into each other. In looking back, as in looking back upon\ndreams, I seem to recall only a few isolated periods clearly; and it\nseems that my imagination must have filled in the swift movement between\nepisodes. I think now, of necessity, in terms of centuries and\nmillenniums, rather than days and months.... The snow blows terribly\nabout my little fire, and I know it will soon gather courage to quench\nus both ...\n\n\n\nYears passed, at first with a sort of clear wonder. I watched things\nthat took place everywhere in the world. I studied. The other students\nwere much amazed to see me, a man of thirty odd, coming back to college.\n\n\"But Judas, Dennell, you've already got your Ph.D! What more do you\nwant?\" So they would all ask me. And I would reply;\n\n\"I want an M.D. and an F.R.C.S.\" I didn't tell them that I wanted\ndegrees in Law, too, and in Biology and Chemistry, in Architecture and\nEngineering, in Psychology and Philosophy. Even so, I believe they\nthought me mad. But poor fools! I would think. They can hardly realize\nthat I have all of eternity before me to study.\n\nI went to school for many decades. I would pass from University to\nUniversity, leisurely gathering all the fruits of every subject I took\nup, revelling in study as no student revelled ever before. There was no\nneed of hurry in my life, no fear of death too soon. There was a\nmagnificence of vigor in my body, and a magnificence of vision and\nclarity in my brain. I felt myself a super-man. I had only to go on\nstoring up wisdom until the day should come when all knowledge of the\nworld was mine, and then I could command the world. I had no need for\nhurry. O vast life! How I gloried in my eternity! And how little good it\nhas ever done me, by the irony of God.\n\nFor several centuries, changing my name and passing from place to place,\nI continued my studies. I had no consciousness of monotony, for, to the\nintellect, monotony cannot exist: it was one of those emotions I had\nleft behind. One day, however, in the year 2132, a great discovery was\nmade by a man called Zarentzov. It had to do with the curvature of\nspace, quite changing the conceptions that we had all followed since\nEinstein. I had long ago mastered the last detail of Einstein's theory,\nas had, in time, the rest of the world. I threw myself immediately into\nthe study of this new, epoch-making conception.\n\nTo my amazement, it all seemed to me curiously dim and elusive. I could\nnot quite grasp what Zarentzov was trying to formulate.\n\n\"Why,\" I cried, \"the thing is a monstrous fraud!\" I went to the\nprofessor of Physics in the University I then attended, and I told him\nit was a fraud, a huge book of mere nonsense. He looked at me rather\npityingly.\n\n\"I am afraid, Modevski,\" he said, addressing me by the name I was at the\ntime using, \"I am afraid you do not understand it, that is all. When\nyour mind has broadened, you will. You should apply yourself more\ncarefully to your Physics.\" But that angered me, for I had mastered my\nPhysics before he was ever born. I challenged him to explain the theory.\nAnd he did! He put it, obviously, in the clearest language he could. Yet\nI understood nothing. I stared at him dumbly, until he shook his head\nimpatiently, saying that it was useless, that if I could not grasp it I\nwould simply have to keep on studying. I was stunned. I wandered away in\na daze.\n\nFor do you see what happened? During all those years I had studied\nceaselessly, and my mind had been clear and quick as the day I first had\nleft the hospital. But all that time I had been able only to remain what\nI was--an extraordinarily intelligent man of the twentieth century. And\nthe rest of the race had been progressing! It had been swiftly gathering\nknowledge and power and ability all that time, faster and faster, while\nI had been only remaining still. And now here was Zarentzov and the\nteachers of the Universities, and, probably, a hundred intelligent men,\nwho had all outstripped me! I was being left behind.\n\nAnd that is what happened. I need not dilate further upon it. By the end\nof that century I had been left behind by all the students of the world,\nand I never did understand Zarentzov. Other men came with other\ntheories, and these theories were accepted by the world. But I could not\nunderstand them. My intellectual life was at an end. I had nothing more\nto understand. I knew everything I was capable of knowing, and,\nthenceforth, I could only play wearily with the old ideas.\n\n\n\nMany things happened in the world. A time came when the East and West,\ntwo mighty unified hemispheres, rose up in arms: the civil war of a\nplanet. I recall only chaotic visions of fire and thunder and hell. It\nwas all incomprehensible to me: like a bizarre dream, things happened,\npeople rushed about, but I never knew what they were doing. I lurked\nduring all that time in a tiny shuddering hole under the city of\nYokohama, and by a miracle I survived. And the East won. But it seems to\nhave mattered little who did win, for all the world had become, in all\nexcept its few remaining prejudices, a single race, and nothing was\nchanged when it was all rebuilt again, under a single government.\n\nI saw the first of the strange creatures who appeared among us in the\nyear 6371, men who were later known to be from the planet Venus. But\nthey were repulsed, for they were savages compared with the Earthmen,\nalthough they were about equal to the people of my own century, 1900.\nThose of them who did not perish of the cold after the intense warmth of\ntheir world, and those who were not killed by our hands, those few\nreturned silently home again. And I have always regretted that I had not\nthe courage to go with them.\n\nI watched a time when the world reached perfection in mechanics, when\nmen could accomplish anything with a touch of the finger. Strange men,\nthese creatures of the hundredth century, men with huge brains and tiny\nshriveled bodies, atrophied limbs, and slow, ponderous movements on\ntheir little conveyances. It was I, with my ancient compunctions, who\nshuddered when at last they put to death all the perverts, the\ncriminals, and the insane, ridding the world of the scum for which they\nhad no more need. It was then that I was forced to produce my tattered\nold papers, proving my identity and my story. They knew it was true, in\nsome strange fashion of theirs, and, thereafter, I was kept on\nexhibition as an archaic survival.\n\nI saw the world made immortal through the new invention of a man called\nKathol, who used somewhat the same method \"legend\" decreed had been used\nupon me. I observed the end of speech, of all perceptions except one,\nwhen men learned to communicate directly by thought, and to receive\ndirectly into the brain all the myriad vibrations of the universe.\n\nAll these things I saw, and more, until that time when there was no more\ndiscovery, but a Perfect World in which there was no need for anything\nbut memory. Men ceased to count time at last. Several hundred years\nafter the 154th Dynasty from the Last War, or, as we would have counted\nin my time, about 200,000 A.D., official records of time were no longer\nkept carefully. They fell into disuse. Men began to forget years, to\nforget time at all. Of what significance was time when one was immortal?\n\n\n\nAfter long, long uncounted centuries, a time came when the days grew\nnoticeably colder. Slowly the winters became longer, and the summers\ndiminished to but a month or two. Fierce storms raged endlessly in\nwinter, and in summer sometimes there was severe frost, sometimes there\nwas only frost. In the high places and in the north and the\nsub-equatorial south, the snow came and would not go.\n\nMen died by the thousands in the higher latitudes. New York became,\nafter awhile, the furthest habitable city north, an arctic city, where\nwarmth seldom penetrated. And great fields of ice began to make their\nway southward, grinding before them the brittle remains of\ncivilizations, covering over relentlessly all of man's proud work.\n\nSnow appeared in Florida and Italy one summer. In the end, snow was\nthere always. Men left New York, Chicago, Paris, Yokohama, and\neverywhere they traveled by the millions southward, perishing as they\nwent, pursued by the snow and the cold, and that inevitable field of\nice. They were feeble creatures when the Cold first came upon them, but\nI speak in terms of thousands of years; and they turned every weapon of\nscience to the recovery of their physical power, for they foresaw that\nthe only chance for survival lay in a hard, strong body. As for me, at\nlast I had found a use for my few powers, for my physique was the finest\nin that world. It was but little comfort, however, for we were all\nunited in our awful fear of that Cold and that grinding field of Ice.\nAll the great cities were deserted. We would catch silent, fearful\nglimpses of them as we sped on in our machines over the snow--great\nhungry, haggard skeletons of cities, shrouded in banks of snow, snow\nthat the wind rustled through desolate streets where the cream of human\nlife once had passed in calm security. Yet still the Ice pursued. For\nmen had forgotten about that Last Ice Age when they ceased to reckon\ntime, when they lost sight of the future and steeped themselves in\nmemories. They had not remembered that a time must come when Ice would\nlie white and smooth over all the earth, when the sun would shine\nbleakly between unending intervals of dim, twilight snow and sleet.\n\nSlowly the Ice pursued us down the earth, until all the feeble remains\nof civilization were gathered in Egypt and India and South America. The\ndeserts flowered again, but the frost would come always to bite the tiny\ncrops. For still the Ice came. All the world now, but for a narrow strip\nabout the equator, was one great silent desolate vista of stark\nice-plains, ice that brooded above the hidden ruins of cities that had\nendured for hundreds of thousands of years. It was terrible to imagine\nthe awful solitude and the endless twilight that lay on these places,\nand the grim snow, sailing in silence over all....\n\nIt surrounded us on all sides, until life remained only in a few\nscattered clearings all about that equator of the globe, with an eternal\nfire going to hold away the hungry Ice. Perpetual winter reigned now;\nand we were becoming terror-stricken beasts that preyed on each other\nfor a life already doomed. Ah, but I, I the archaic survival, I had my\nrevenge then, with my great physique and strong jaws--God! Let me think\nof something else. Those men who lived upon each other--it was horrible.\nAnd I was one.\n\n\n\nSo inevitably the Ice closed in.... One day the men of our tiny clearing\nwere but a score. We huddled about our dying fire of bones and stray\nlogs. We said nothing. We just sat, in deep, wordless, thoughtless\nsilence. We were the last outpost of Mankind.\n\nI think suddenly something very noble must have transformed these\ncreatures to a semblance of what they had been of old. I saw, in their\neyes, the question they sent from one to another, and in every eye I saw\nthat the answer was, Yes. With one accord they rose before my eyes and,\nignoring me as a baser creature, they stripped away their load of\ntattered rags and, one by one, they stalked with their tiny shrivelled\nlimbs into the shivering gale of swirling, gusting snow, and\ndisappeared. And I was alone....\n\nSo am I alone now. I have written this last fantastic history of myself\nand of Mankind upon a substance that will, I know, outlast even the snow\nand the Ice--as it has outlasted Mankind that made it. It is the only\nthing with which I have never parted. For is it not irony that I should\nbe the historian of this race--I, a savage, an \"archaic survival?\" Why\ndo I write? God knows, but some instinct prompts me, although there will\nnever be men to read.\n\nI have been sitting here, waiting, and I have thought often of Sir John\nand Alice, whom I loved. Can it be that I am feeling again, after all\nthese ages, some tiny portion of that emotion, that great passion I once\nknew? I see her face before me, the face I have lost from my thoughts\nfor eons, and something is in it that stirs my blood again. Her eyes are\nhalf-closed and deep, her lips are parted as though I could crush them\nwith an infinity of wonder and discovery. O God! It is love again, love\nthat I thought was lost! They have often smiled upon me when I spoke of\nGod, and muttered about my foolish, primitive superstitions. But they\nare gone, and I am left who believe in God, and surely there is purpose\nin it.\n\nI am cold, I have written. Ah, I am frozen. My breath freezes as it\nmingles with the air, and I can hardly move my numbed fingers. The Ice\nis closing over me, and I cannot break it any longer. The storm cries\nweirdly all about me in the twilight, and I know this is the end. The\nend of the world. And I--I, the last man....\n\nThe last man....\n\n... I am cold--cold....\n\nBut is it you, Alice? Is it you?\n\n\nTHE END",
