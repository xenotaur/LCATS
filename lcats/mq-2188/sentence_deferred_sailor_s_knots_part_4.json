    "body": "1909\n\n\n\nSENTENCE DEFERRED\n\nFortunately for Captain Bligh, there were but few people about, and the\nonly person who saw him trip Police-Sergeant Pilbeam was an elderly man\nwith a wooden leg, who joined the indignant officer in the pursuit.  The\ncaptain had youth on his side, and, diving into the narrow alley-ways\nthat constitute the older portion of Wood-hatch, he moderated his pace\nand listened acutely.  The sounds of pursuit died away in the distance,\nand he had already dropped into a walk when the hurried tap of the wooden\nleg sounded from one corner and a chorus of hurried voices from the\nother.  It was clear that the number of hunters had increased.\n\nHe paused a second, irresolute.  The next, he pushed open a door that\nstood ajar in an old flint wall and peeped in.  He saw a small, brick-\npaved yard, in which trim myrtles and flowering plants stood about in\nfreshly ochred pots, and, opening the door a little wider, he slipped in\nand closed it behind him.\n\n\"Well?\"  said a voice, sharply.  \"What do you want?\"\n\nCaptain Bligh turned, and saw a girl standing in a hostile attitude in\nthe doorway of the house.  \"H'sh!\" he said, holding up his finger.\n\nThe girl's cheeks flushed and her eyes sparkled.\n\n\"What are you doing in our yard?\" she demanded.\n\nThe captain's face relaxed as the sound of voices died away.  He gave his\nmoustache a twist, and eyed her with frank admiration.\n\n\"Escaping,\" he said, briefly.  \"They nearly had me, though.\"\n\n\"You had no business to escape into our yard,\" said the girl.  \"What have\nyou been escaping from?\"\n\n\"Fat policeman,\" said the skipper, jauntily, twisting his moustache.\n\nMiss Pilbeam, only daughter of Sergeant Pilbeam, caught her breath\nsharply.\n\n\"What have you been doing?\" she inquired, as soon as she could control\nher voice.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said the skipper, airily, \"nothing.  I was kicking a stone\nalong the path and he told me to stop it.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Miss Pilbeam, impatiently.\n\n\"We had words,\" said the skipper.  \"I don't like policemen--fat\npolicemen--and while we were talking he happened to lose his balance and\ngo over into some mud that was swept up at the side of the road.\"\n\n\"Lost his balance?\" gasped the horrified Miss Pilbeam.\n\nThe skipper was flattered at her concern.  \"You would have laughed if you\nhad seen him,\" he said, smiling.  \"Don't look so frightened; he hasn't\ngot me yet.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the girl, slowly.  \"Not yet.\"\n\nShe gazed at him with such a world of longing in her eyes that the\nskipper, despite a somewhat large share of self-esteem, was almost\nstartled.\n\n\"And he shan't have me,\" he said, returning her gaze with interest.\n\nMiss Pilbeam stood in silent thought.  She was a strong, well-grown girl,\nbut she realized fully that she was no match for the villain who stood\nbefore her, twisting his moustache and adjusting his neck-tie.  And her\nfather would not be off duty until nine.\n\n\"I suppose you would like to wait here until it is dark?\" she said at\nlast.\n\n\"I would sooner wait here than anywhere,\" said the skipper, with\nrespectful ardor.\n\n\"Perhaps you would like to come in and sit down?\" said the girl.\n\nCaptain Bligh thanked her, and removing his cap followed her into a small\nparlor in the front of the house.\n\n\"Father is out,\" she said, as she motioned him to an easy-chair, \"but I'm\nsure he'll be pleased to see you when he comes in.\"\n\n\"And I shall be pleased to see him,\" said the innocent skipper.\n\nMiss Pilbeam kept her doubts to herself and sat in a brown study,\nwondering how the capture was to be effected.  She had a strong\npresentiment that the appearance of her father at the front door would be\nthe signal for her visitor's departure at the back.  For a time there was\nan awkward silence.\n\n\"Lucky thing for me I upset that policeman,\" said the skipper, at last.\n\n\"Why?\" inquired the girl.\n\n\"Else I shouldn't have come into your yard,\" was the reply.  \"It's the\nfirst time we have ever put into Woodhatch, and I might have sailed away\nand never seen you.  Where should we have been but for that fat\npoliceman?\"\n\nMiss Pilbeam--as soon as she could get her breath--said, \"Ah, where\nindeed!\" and for the first time in her life began to feel the need of a\nchaperon.\n\n\"Funny to think of him hunting for me high and low while I am sitting\nhere,\" said the skipper.\n\nMiss Pilbeam agreed with him, and began to laugh--to laugh so heartily\nthat he was fain at last to draw his chair close to hers and pat her\nsomewhat anxiously on the back.  The treatment sobered her at once, and\nshe drew apart and eyed him coldly.\n\n\"I was afraid you would lose your breath,\" explained the skipper,\nawkwardly.  \"You are not angry, are you?\"\n\nHe was so genuinely relieved when she said, \"No,\" that Miss Pilbeam,\ndespite her father's wrongs, began to soften a little.  The upsetter of\npolicemen was certainly good-looking; and his manner towards her so\nnicely balanced between boldness and timidity that a slight feeling of\nsadness at his lack of moral character began to assail her.\n\n\"Suppose you are caught after all?\" she said, presently.  \"You will go to\nprison.\"\n\nThe skipper shrugged his shoulders.  \"I don't suppose I shall be,\" he\nreplied.\n\n\"Aren't you sorry?\" persisted Miss Pilbeam, in a vibrant voice.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said the skipper.  \"Why, I shouldn't have seen you if I\nhadn't done it.\"\n\nMiss Pilbeam looked at the clock and pondered.  It wanted but five\nminutes to nine.  Five minutes in which to make up a mind that was in a\nstate of strong unrest.\n\n\"I suppose it is time for me to go,\" said the skipper, watching her.\nMiss Pilbeam rose.  \"No, don't go,\" she said, hastily.  \"Do be quiet.\nI want to think.\"\n\nCaptain Bligh waited in respectful silence, heedless of the fateful\nseconds ticking from the mantelpiece.  At the sound of a slow, measured\nfootfall on the cobblestone path outside Miss Pilbeam caught his arm and\ndrew him towards the door.\n\n\"Go!\" she breathed.  \"No, stop!\"\n\nShe stood trying in vain to make up her mind.  \"Upstairs,\" she said.\n\"Quick!\" and, leading the way, entered her father's bedroom, and, after a\nmoment's thought, opened the door of a cupboard in the corner.\n\n\"Get in there,\" she whispered.\n\n\"But--\" objected the astonished Bligh.\n\nThe front door was heard to open.\n\n\"Police!\" said Miss Pilbeam, in a thrilling whisper.  The skipper stepped\ninto the cupboard without further parley, and the girl, turning the key,\nslipped it into her pocket and sped downstairs.\n\nSergeant Pilbeam was in the easy-chair, with his belt unfastened, when\nshe entered the parlor, and, with a hungry reference to supper, sat\nwatching her as she lit the lamp and drew down the blind.  With a\nlifelong knowledge of the requirements of the Force, she drew a jug of\nbeer and placed it by his side while she set the table.\n\n\"Ah! I wanted that,\" said the sergeant.  \"I've been running.\"\n\nMiss Pilbeam raised her eyebrows.\n\n\"After some sailor-looking chap that capsized me when I wasn't prepared\nfor it,\" said her father, putting down his glass.  \"It was a neat bit o'\nwork, and I shall tell him so when I catch him.  Look here!\"\n\nHe stood up and exhibited the damage.\n\n\"I've rubbed off what I could,\" he said, resuming his seat, \"and I s'pose\nthe rest'll brush off when it's dry.  To-morrow morning I shall go down\nto the harbor and try and spot my lord.\"\n\nHe drew his chair to the table and helped himself, and, filling his mouth\nwith cold meat and pickles, enlarged on his plans for the capture of his\nassailant; plans to which the undecided Miss Pilbeam turned a somewhat\nabstracted ear.\n\nBy the time her father had finished his supper she was trying, but in\nvain, to devise means for the prisoner's escape.  The sergeant had opened\nthe door of the room for the sake of fresh air, and it was impossible for\nanybody to come downstairs without being seen.  The story of a sickly\ngeranium in the back-yard left him unmoved.\n\n\"I wouldn't get up for all the geraniums in the world,\" he declared.\n\"I'm just going to have one more pipe and then I'm off to bed.  Running\ndon't agree with me.\"\n\nHe went, despite his daughter's utmost efforts to prevent him, and she\nsat in silent consternation, listening to his heavy tread overhead.  She\nheard the bed creak in noisy protest as he climbed in, and ten minutes\nlater the lusty snoring of a healthy man of full habit resounded through\nthe house.\n\nShe went to bed herself at last, and, after lying awake for nearly a\ncouple of hours, closed her eyes in order to think better.  She awoke\nwith the sun pouring in at the window and the sounds of vigorous brushing\nin the yard beneath.\n\n\"I've nearly got it off,\" said the sergeant, looking up.  \"It's\ndestroying evidence in a sense, I suppose; but I can't go about with my\nuniform plastered with mud.  I've had enough chaff about it as it is.\"\n\nMiss Pilbeam stole to the door of the next room and peeped stealthily in.\nNot a sound came from the cupboard, and a horrible idea that the prisoner\nmight have been suffocated set her trembling with apprehension.\n\n\"H'sh!\" she whispered.\n\nAn eager but stifled \"H'st!\" came from the cup-board, and Miss Pilbeam,\nher fears allayed, stepped softly into the room.\n\n\"He's downstairs brushing the mud off,\" she said, in a low voice.\n\n\"Who is?\"  said the skipper.\n\n\"The fat policeman,\" said the girl, in a hard voice, as she remembered\nher father's wrongs.\n\n\"What's he doing it here for?\" demanded the astonished skipper.\n\n\"Because he lives here.\"\n\n\"Lodger?\" queried the skipper, more astonished than before.\n\n\"Father,\" said Miss Pilbeam.\n\nA horrified groan from the cupboard fell like music on her ears.  Then\nthe smile forsook her lips, and she stood quivering with indignation as\nthe groan gave way to suppressed but unmistakable laughter.\n\n\"H'sh!\" she said sharply, and with head erect sailed out of the room and\nwent downstairs to give Mr. Pilbeam his breakfast.\n\nTo the skipper in the confined space and darkness of the cupboard the\nbreakfast seemed unending.  The sergeant evidently believed in sitting\nover his meals, and his deep, rumbling voice, punctuated by good-natured\nlaughter, was plainly audible.  To pass the time the skipper fell to\ncounting, and, tired of that, recited some verses that he had acquired at\nschool.  After that, and with far more heartiness, he declaimed a few\nthings that he had learned since; and still the clatter and rumble\nsounded from below.\n\nIt was a relief to him when he heard the sergeant push his chair back and\nmove heavily about the room.  A minute later he heard him ascending the\nstairs, and then he held his breath with horror as the foot-steps entered\nthe room and a heavy hand was laid on the cupboard door.\n\n\"Elsie!\" bawled the sergeant.  \"Where's the key of my cupboard?  I want\nmy other boots.\"\n\n\"They're down here,\" cried the voice of Miss Pilbeam, and the skipper,\nhardly able to believe in his good fortune, heard the sergeant go\ndownstairs again.\n\nAt the expiration of another week--by his own reckoning--he heard the\nlight, hurried footsteps of Miss Pilbeam come up the stairs and pause at\nthe door.\n\n\"H'st!\" he said, recklessly.\n\n\"I'm coming,\" said the girl.  \"Don't be impatient.\"\n\nA key turned in the lock, the door was flung open, and the skipper, dazed\nand blinking with the sudden light, stumbled into the room.\n\n\"Father's gone,\" said Miss Pilbeam.\n\nThe skipper made no answer.  He was administering first aid to a right\nleg which had temporarily forgotten how to perform its duties, varied\nwith slaps and pinches at a left which had gone to sleep.  At intervals\nhe turned a red-rimmed and reproachful eye on Miss Pilbeam.\n\n\"You want a wash and some breakfast,\" she said, softly, \"especially a\nwash.  There's water and a towel, and while you're making yourself tidy\nI'll be getting breakfast.\"\n\nThe skipper hobbled to the wash-stand, and, dipping his head in a basin\nof cool water, began to feel himself again.  By the time he had done his\nhair in the sergeant's glass and twisted his moustache into shape he felt\nbetter still, and he went downstairs almost blithely.\n\n\"I'm very sorry it was your father,\" he said, as he took a seat at the\ntable.  \"Very.\"\n\n\"That's why you laughed, I suppose?\" said the girl, tossing her head.\n\n\"Well, I've had the worst of it,\" said the other.  \"I'd sooner be upset a\nhundred times than spend a night in that cupboard.  However, all's well\nthat ends well.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Miss Pilbeam, dolefully, \"but is it the end?\"\n\nCaptain Bligh put down his knife and fork and eyed her uneasily.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he said.\n\n\"Never mind; don't spoil your breakfast,\" said the girl.  \"I'll tell you\nafterwards.  It's horrid to think, after all my trouble, of your doing\ntwo months as well as a night in the cupboard.\"\n\n\"Beastly,\" said the unfortunate, eying her in great concern.  \"But what's\nthe matter?\"\n\n\"One can't think of everything,\" said Miss Pilbeam, \"but, of course, we\nought to have thought of the mate getting uneasy when you didn't turn up\nlast night, and going to the police-station with a description of you.\"\n\nThe skipper started and smote the table with his fist.\n\n\"Father's gone down to watch the ship now,\" said Miss Pilbeam.  \"Of\ncourse, it's the exact description of the man that assaulted him.\nProvidential he called it.\"\n\n\"That's the worst of having a fool for a mate,\" said the skipper,\nbitterly.  \"What business was it of his, I should like to know?  What's\nit got to do with him whether I turn up or not?  What does he want to\ninterfere for?\"\n\n\"It's no good blaming him,\" said Miss Pilbeam, thinking deeply, with her\nchin on her finger.  \"The thing is, what is to be done?  Once father gets\nhis hand on you----\"\n\nShe shuddered; so did the skipper.\n\n\"I might get off with a fine; I didn't hurt him,\" he remarked.\n\nMiss Pilbeam shook her head.  \"They're very strict in Woodhatch,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"I was a fool to touch him at all,\" said the repentant skipper.  \"High\nspirits, that's what it was.  High spirits, and being spoken to as if I\nwas a child.\"\n\n\"The thing is, how are you to escape?\" said the girl.  \"It's no good\ngoing out of doors with the police and half the people in Woodhatch all\non the look-out for you.\"\n\n\"If I could only get aboard I should be all right,\" muttered the skipper.\n\"I could keep down the fo'-c's'le while the mate took the ship out.\"\n\nMiss Pilbeam sat in deep thought.  \"It's the getting aboard that's the\ntrouble,\" she said, slowly.  \"You'd have to disguise yourself.  It would\nhave to be a good disguise, too, to pass my father, I can tell you.\"\n\nCaptain Bligh gave a gloomy assent.\n\n\"The only thing for you to do, so far as I can see,\" said the girl,\nslowly, \"is to make yourself up like a coalie.  There are one or two\ncolliers in the harbor, and if you took off your coat--I could send it on\nafterwards--rubbed yourself all over with coal-dust, and shaved off your\nmoustache, I believe you would escape.\"\n\n\"Shave!\" ejaculated the skipper, in choking accents.  \"Rub--!\nCoal-dust!\"\n\n\"It's your only chance,\" said Miss Pilbeam.\n\nCaptain Bligh leaned back frowning, and from sheer force of habit passed\nthe ends of his moustache slowly through his fingers.  \"I think the coal-\ndust would be enough,\" he said at last.\n\nThe girl shook her head.  \"Father particularly noticed your moustache,\"\nshe said.\n\n\"Everybody does,\" said the skipper, with mournful pride.  \"I won't part\nwith it.\"\n\n\"Not for my sake?\" inquired Miss Pilbeam, eying him mournfully.  \"Not\nafter all I've done for you?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the other, stoutly.\n\nMiss Pilbeam put her handkerchief to her eyes and, with a suspicious\nlittle sniff, hurried from the room.  Captain Bligh, much affected,\nwaited for a few seconds and then went in pursuit of her.  Fifteen\nminutes later, shorn of his moustache, he stood in the coal-hole, sulkily\nsmearing himself with coal.\n\n\"That's better,\" said the girl; \"you look horrible.\"\n\nShe took up a handful of coal-dust and, ordering him to stoop, shampooed\nhim with hearty good-will.\n\n\"No good half doing it,\" she declared.  \"Now go and look at yourself in\nthe glass in the kitchen.\"\n\nThe skipper went, and came back in a state of wild-eyed misery.  Even\nMiss Pilbeam's statement that his own mother would not know him failed to\nlift the cloud from his brow.  He stood disconsolate as the girl opened\nthe front door.\n\n\"Good-by,\" she said, gently.  \"Write and tell me when you are safe.\"\n\nCaptain Bligh promised, and walked slowly up the road.  So far from\npeople attempting to arrest him, they vied with each other in giving him\nelbow-room.  He reached the harbor unmolested, and, lurking at a\nconvenient corner, made a careful survey.  A couple of craft were working\nout their coal, a small steamer was just casting loose, and a fishing-\nboat gliding slowly over the still water to its berth.  His own schooner,\nwhich lay near the colliers, had apparently knocked off work pending his\narrival.  For Sergeant Pilbeam he looked in vain.\n\nHe waited a minute or two, and then, with a furtive glance right and\nleft, strolled in a careless fashion until he was abreast of one of the\ncolliers.  Nobody took any notice of him, and, with his hands in his\npockets, he gazed meditatively into the water and edged along towards his\nown craft.  His foot trembled as he placed it on the plank that formed\nthe gangway, but, resisting the temptation to look behind, he gained the\ndeck and walked forward.\n\n\"Halloa!  What do you want?\"  inquired a sea-man, coming out of the\ngalley.\n\n\"All right, Bill,\" said the skipper, in a low voice.  \"Don't take any\nnotice of me.\"\n\n\"Eh?\" said the seaman, starting.  \"Good lor'!  What ha' you----\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" said the skipper, fiercely; and, walking to the forecastle,\nplaced his hand on the scuttle and descended with studied slowness.  As\nhe reached the floor the perturbed face of Bill blocked the opening.\n\n\"Had an accident, cap'n?\" he inquired, respectfully.\n\n\"No,\" snapped the skipper.  \"Come down here--quick!  Don't stand up there\nattracting attention.  Do you want the whole town round you?  Come down!\"\n\n\"I'm all right where I am,\" said Bill, backing hastily as the skipper,\nputting a foot on the ladder, thrust a black and furious face close to\nhis.\n\n\"Clear out, then,\" hissed the skipper.  \"Go and send the mate to me.\nDon't hurry.  And if anybody noticed me come aboard and should ask you\nwho I am, say I'm a pal of yours.\"\n\nThe seaman, marvelling greatly, withdrew, and the skipper, throwing\nhimself on a locker, wiped a bit of grit out of his eye and sat down to\nwait for the mate.  He was so long in coming that he waxed impatient, and\nascending a step of the ladder again peeped on to the deck.  The first\nobject that met his gaze was the figure of the mate leaning against the\nside of the ship with a wary eye on the scuttle.\n\n\"Come here,\" said the skipper.\n\n\"Anything wrong?\" inquired the mate, retreating a couple of paces in\ndisorder.\n\n\"Come--here!\" repeated the skipper.\n\nThe mate advanced slowly, and in response to an imperative command from\nthe skipper slowly descended and stood regarding him nervously.\n\n\"Yes; you may look,\" said the skipper, with sudden ferocity.  \"This is\nall your doing.  Where are you going?\"\n\nHe caught the mate by the coat as he was making for the ladder, and\nhauled him back again.\n\n\"You'll go when I've finished with you,\" he said, grimly.  \"Now, what do\nyou mean by it?  Eh?  What do you mean by it?\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" said the mate, in a soothing voice.  \"Don't get\nexcited.\"\n\n\"Look at me!\" said the skipper.  \"All through your interfering.  How dare\nyou go making inquiries about me?\"\n\n\"Me?\" said the mate, backing as far as possible.  \"Inquiries?\"\n\n\"What's it got to do with you if I stay out all night?\"  pursued the\nskipper.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said the other, feebly.\n\n\"What did you go to the police about me for, then?\" demanded the skipper.\n\n\"Me?\" said the mate, in the shrill accents of astonishment.  \"Me?\nI didn't go to no police about you.  Why should I?\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say you didn't report my absence last night to the\npolice?\"  said the skipper, sternly.\n\n\"Cert'nly not,\" said the mate, plucking up courage.  \"Why should I?  If\nyou like to take a night off it's nothing to do with me.  I 'ope I know\nmy duty better.  I don't know what you're talking about.\"\n\n\"And the police haven't been watching the ship and inquiring for me?\"\nasked the skipper.\n\nThe mate shook his bewildered head.  \"Why should they?\" he inquired.\n\nThe skipper made no reply.  He sat goggle-eyed, staring straight before\nhim, trying in vain to realize the hardness of the heart that had been\nresponsible for such a scurvy trick.\n\n\"Besides, it ain't the fust time you've been out all night,\" remarked the\nmate, aggressively.\n\nThe skipper favored him with a glance the dignity of which was somewhat\nimpaired by his complexion, and in a slow and stately fashion ascended to\nthe deck.  Then he caught his breath sharply and paled beneath the\ncoaldust as he saw Sergeant Pilbeam standing on the quay, opposite the\nship.  By his side stood Miss Pilbeam, and both, with a far-away look in\ntheir eyes, were smiling vaguely but contentedly at the horizon.  The\nsergeant appeared to be the first to see the skipper.\n\n\"Ahoy, Darkie!\" he cried.\n\nCaptain Bligh, who was creeping slowly aft, halted, and, clenching his\nfists, regarded him ferociously.\n\n\"Give this to the skipper, will you, my lad?\" said the sergeant, holding\nup the jacket Bligh had left behind.  \"Good-looking young man with a very\nfine moustache he is.\"\n\n\"Was,\" said his daughter, in a mournful voice.\n\n\"And a rather dark complexion,\" continued the sergeant, grinning madly.\n\"I was going to take him--for stealing my coal--but I thought better of\nit.  Thought of a better way.  At least, my daughter did.  So long;\nDarkie.\"\n\nHe kissed the top of a fat middle finger, and, turning away, walked off\nwith Miss Pilbeam.  The skipper stood watching them with his head\nswimming until, arrived at the corner, they stopped and the sergeant came\nslowly back.\n\n\"I was nearly forgetting,\" he said, slowly.  \"Tell your skipper that if\nso be as he wants to apologize--for stealing my coal--I shall be at home\nat tea at five o'clock.\"\n\nHe jerked his thumb in the direction of Miss Pilbeam and winked with slow\ndeliberation.  \"She'll be there, too,\" he added.  \"Savvy?\"",
