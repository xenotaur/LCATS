life.\n\n   Always the same old job,\n   17 years of it.\n\n   Go nowhere.\n   Be nobody.\n   Do nothing.\n\n   Sheer luxury.\n\nShame\n\n   They got to me.\n\n   They drove me\n   off the deep

cooks,\n   on the stove\n   that is my mind.\n\n   Ideas bob up,\n   then quickly go.\n   But some will stay\n   and add to the\n   flavour that is\n   my twisted mind.\n\nDreaming of dreaming with my cat.\n\n   (Dedicated to Go the cat)\n\n   Early this morning in bed,\n   I had a very pleasant dream.\n\n   I dreamt that I was asleep\n   on the sofa\n   with my cat\n   (that I don't have anymore)\n   curled up on my back,\n   and we were both\n   warm and happy.\n\n   Those types of dreams\n   are always the best\n   and I never want\n   to wake up from them.\n\n   But then again...\n   I'd never get to\n   see the beautiful day\n   in store for me.\n\nPiffle the Cat\n\n   My cat came to me in a dream last night,\n   he needed my love and my reassurance\n   that things would be okay.\n\n   His name was Patches,\n   but he answered to Piffle\n   and he was a sook and a cuddler.\n\n   My cat came to me in a dream last night,\n   he never deserved to go\n   the way that he did.\n   no-one did.\n   you see, he was killed by vicious dogs\n   at the front door of his home\n\n   He never did learn to fight\n   only to run\n   But he wasn't fast enough that day,\n   he was getting a little old.\n\n   My cat came to me in a dream last night,\n   I told him I loved him and he told me the same,\n   for it was twenty years ago\n   that he was taken away\n   to the very day.\n\nMy Mum\n\n   I love my Mum,\n   I always do,\n   always have,\n   always will.\n\n   She's always joining dots,\n   but never quite\n   getting the picture.\n\n   So we're always\n   drawing those pictures,\n   Dad and me.\n\n   Framing them,\n   and hanging them\n   on the walls,\n   for Mum to see.\n\n   I love Mum!\n   Everybody does.\n   She's such a\n   loving, lovable, caring\n   and wonderful human being.\n   God, I love her.\n\nWhite Space\n\n   Here I sit,\n   at my word pro,\n\n   the white space\n   staring me down,\n   but not out.\n\n   I experiment,\n   juxtaposing\n   pseudo-random words\n   into pretentious,\n   premeditated\n   poetry.\n\n   Then with an afflatus,\n   words flow,\n   whispered by my muse,\n   into lines and stanzas.\n\nLife's A Beach\n\n   I am not you.\n   You are not me.\n   Me, myself and I will get alone just fine.\n   Fine for that is life.\n   Life in the suburbs is sedate.\n   Sedated in the psych. wards.\n   Wardrobe looks a little bare.\n   Bare all at the beach.\n\nMerchant Banker\n\n   Merchant banker\n   willie wanker\n   likes to spank her\n   can't thank her\n\n   change the lock\n   adjust the clock\n   darn my sock\n   suck my cock\n\nMega, Giga, Tera\n\n   Down in those malls\n   those super malls\n   we've got mega stores\n   and we're making them bigger\n\n   1000 times more,\n   giga stores\n   NO!!!\n   make them bigger still\n   a million times better\n   more freebees\n   a million times bigger...\n   we'll call them TERASTORES.\n\n   $1,000,000,000,000\n\nA million to hate\n\n   how many men could I find to hate ???\n   how many have betrayed me ???\n   10, 100, 1000\n   or a million times more\n\n   It's just how you look at it;\n   'cos if you don't have the time\n   or the energy to hate\n   then you will find true peace\n   if only you look inside.\n\nTo have lived our fantasies\n\n   I found you\n   you found me\n   we corresponded\n   we fantasized\n\n   I gave without questioning\n   you promised it all\n   but you delivered nothing\n\n   had you really promised without thinking ???\n   or did your feet turn cold ???\n\nAnd the Expletives Remained\n\n   The lines flowed,\n   the poem wrote itself\n   and the expletives remained\n\n   Fuck the Poetry Police!\n   Fuck you all, very much.\n\nSpinning Out\n\n   The last time I was\n   \" hearing voices\" again\n   was only a couple of days ago.\n   I was sick in bed\n   with a viral infection.\n   I was trying to sleep\n   but voices kept saying\n   \" Think what you know is true.\"\n\n   But then I would think,\n   \" Well what do I know is the truth ?\"\n\n   Then I'd think of something\n   and say, well that's true,\n   and quick as a flash\n   another voice would say\n   \" Is that really what you believe ?\n   Is that what is true ?\n   Isn't that bullshit ?\"\n\n   And then I'd have to think of\n   something else to believe in.\n\n   And this was not a relaxed process.\n   No way!\n   It was manic.\n\n   It seemed to happen\n   a 1000 times a minute,\n   and it just wouldn't stop.\n\n   At least, it went on\n   for an hour or so,\n   and it seemed like an eternity.\n\n   Just another day\n   in the life of\n   \"a person with schizophrenia.\"\n\nWalls & Sledge Hammers\n\n   Where do I start ?\n   At the beginning of course,\n   but where is that exactly ?\n   I am\n   (to state it in\n   politically incorrectly language)\n   a schizophrenic.\n\n   And I have been living\n   with that label\n   for the past 15-odd years now.\n\n   I live by myself,\n   have a few close friends...\n\n   But I count myself as\n   one of the lucky ones\n   because throughout all of times\n   in and out of\n   psych. wards of hospitals,\n\n   I kept the same job,\n   with a large\n   government organization,\n\n   and they've been very\n   supportive towards me.\n\n   Today, at work,\n   in my lucky full time job\n   as a government nobody,\n   I get largely left alone and\n   to my own devices.\n\n   For better or for worse,\n   but always with an occasional\n   supervisory peer\n   over my shoulder\n   to keep me in line.\n\n   \"Oh yes, <Fred>,\n   your job is safe,\n   we do value your work,\n   just keep going\n   at your own pace.\n\n   We're not too sure\n   where or\n   how exactly you fit in,\n\n   but we like\n   having you around,\n   and, hey,\n   somebody has to\n   do the odd jobs,\n   and we think you're\n   just the man.\"\n\n   ***\n\n   Alas,\n   I am not lucky enough\n   to have a job that I'm in love with.\n\n   My career is not my life.\n\n   Sometimes I think that\n   I'm just a tiny cog\n   in a ridiculously enormous machine -\n   but there are also moments\n   when keeping that cog turning\n   seems to make a (slight) difference.\n\n   I have good days\n   and other days.\n\n   Sometimes the other days get ugly.\n\n   But, I always try to do\n   the right things at work,\n   for recognition perhaps,\n   or perhaps simply\n   to prove that I am really\n   not incompetent at my job.\n\n   I can do it well,\n   and I do it the best\n   of my capabilities.\n\n   And if that means that\n   I hit brick walls then\n   so be it -\n\n   I just have to get help\n   when I hit one.\n   I have learnt\n   through bitter experience,\n   that when I hit a wall,\n   they will almost always out-stare me.\n\n   So that's when I get a ladder,\n   or maybe a sledge hammer.\n\nKnots\n\n   (Dedicated to Mistress Alexis)\n\n   I am naked,\n   assume the position.\n   I know it well.\n\n   She grabs her rope.\n   Around it goes.\n   Through my arms\n   and around again,\n\n   knotted then back.\n   \" Keep still, please.\"\n\n   and through again,\n   and back around,\n   again and again,\n   and tied off in\n   a love knot.\n\n   She double-checks\n   the bondage.\n   Finally she is satisfied\n   with my helplessness.\n\n   Then she leaves me alone.\n   I struggle a little.\n   It is hopeless.\n   I am helpless,\n   totally!\n\n   I move around a little,\n   trying to become comfortable.\n\n   The ropes bite in.\n   Time passes,\n   Hands become numb.\n   The clock ticks on.\n   I lose track of time,\n\n   it goes so slowly,\n   how much longer will\n   she make me wait ?\n\n   More time passes.\n   Eventually she comes back.\n   Soon I will have freedom,\n   but not before we\n   have played some more.\n\n   Oh, the agony.\n   Oh, the ecstasy.\n   I truly love it.\n\n   I can't wait for my freedom,\n   then to do it all again.\n\n\"He's fallen in the water!\"\n\n   Ying tong tiddle high poe\n   and other shades of Goonism\n   drifting in and out\n   of the corners of my mind\n   reminiscing about those\n\n   hazy radio days\n   crazy voices reverberating\n   around the room\n   antics of Milligan and co.\n   amazing, surprising,\n\n   entertaining,\n   delighting,\n   always echoing\n\nVoices again.\nBeen there, done that...\n\n   I can still vividly remember\n   the last time that I was \"hearing voices\"\n   (to use a worn out metaphor).\n\n   It was less that a week ago.\n   I had been there a thousand times before.\n\n   Yes, I am on medication.\n   Yes, I do take it regularly.\n\n   But this was only\n   a short lived episode.\n\n   It was a Saturday, and\n   I hadn't gotten dressed all day,\n   but instead I had\n   been napping off and on all day.\n\n   I had also done my weeks washing and\n   had it drying on a clothes horse\n   in the lounge room\n   (as is normal, being winter).\n\n   It was early evening and\n   I wanted to go to sleep.\n\n   Slumber was a blissful escape,\n   or perhaps only sometimes.\n\n   Anyway, I couldn't get any sleep,\n   and my mind was racing.\n\n   \"Everyone's going to find out\n   all about those secrets.\n\n   Everyone will know the\n   worst things that I can imagine.\n\n   They will know all about me\n   and everything that I imagined\n   people saying will be true now.\"\n\n   They keep on going around in my head.\n\n   They're crap,\n   and I know it.\n   They're just voices,\n   I tell myself,\n   but why won't they go away ?\n   A short time passed.\n   More voices,\n   different voices,\n\n   \"You know what to do,\n   Mother always says so.\n   What should I do now ?\n   I don't know!\n   But you know what to do,\n   don't you ?\"\n\n   The vicious circle kept going `round.\n\n   ***\n\n   Time to get up from bed and\n   ring Mum,\n   after all\n   she knows what to do.\n\n   Scattered and shaking,\n   I do this.\n\n   I go to the phone,\n   sit down, and\n   phone ever-reliable Mum.\n\n   She is my tower of strength.\n\n   It's an STD call\n   but I don't care.\n\n   She tells me to ring the Crisis Team\n   (aka the Mental Health Triage)\n   but I can only fumble with\n   my electronic organizer.\n\n   I know exactly how it works,\n   inside and out,\n   but I could not operate it to save myself.\n\n   I get a pen and Mum tells me\n   the phone number of the crisis team and\n   I write it down.\n\n   She tells me that\n   she can be on the next bus\n   if I need her to be with me.\n\n   I tell her \"no thanks,\n   I think I'll be OK\".\n   I hang up the phone and\n   call the Crisis Team.\n\n   I speak to a lady who knows me,\n   although I cannot recall her.\n\n   She talks me through it and\n   tells me to watch a bit of TV or\n   listen to some music and\n   to occupy myself until\n   later in the night.\n\n   My mini-crisis passes\n   as I follow this advice throughout the night.\n\n   Was it because I did all of\n   the \"right things\" or\n   was it simply that my \"medication\"\n   was taking effect ?\n\n   ***\n\n   The above episode\n   was only a small tremor,\n   but it still scared me a bit.\n\n   I guess that I took it better\n   than I otherwise might have\n   because I have been there before\n   and done it all before.\n\n   But that doesn't make it\n   any less scary at the time.\n   It's only with the benefit of hindsight\n   that I can see that I could cope with it.\n\nAn Abecedarian Story\n\n   Aardvarks' abacuses abate academia accordingly as\n   Beavers breech bridges built by\n   Cats claws cleverly constructing,\n   Dogs deeply dig ditches downward\n   Eels electrify electrons, elevating engineered entrapments\n   Fish flatulate food foully\n   Gazelles glide gracefully\n   Hawks hedonistically hold holidays\n   Ibexes idealistically indulge inexpensive infidelities\n   Jackanapes jam jazz, jealous Jehovahs judge\n   Kangaroos' karma kills kindergartens\n   Labradors lament lost love\n   Macaws mainly manipulate manure\n   Nags napalm nasty necrophiles\n   Ocelots often open operas\n   Panthers persistently piss\n   Quails quantify quarrels queerly\n   Rats relegate responsibilities\n   Salmon seldom sing songs\n   Tadpoles tastelessly tell tempting testaments\n   Unicorns unknowingly, unwittingly upbeat urgent urinal usage\n   Venison vent verbal volcanic volleys\n   Wallabies want wellingtons with wings\n   X-Dodos. x-tinct.\n   Yaks yell yesterday's Yiddish yoo-hoos\n   Zebras zip zodiac zones.\n\nHollywood Romantiks\n\n   I long to be loved,\n   just like in the movies.\n   It's all so easy\n   for the love-struck stars\n\n   They met\n   They didn't get along\n   then slowly...\n   they fell in love\n\n   It's so easy\n   for them,\n   they just fall in love\n   easy as pie\n\n   They say,\n   \" It's not fair,\n   It's so easy for them.\n   Why doesn't it happen to me ?\"\n\n   It doesn't happen to me either!\n   Life is not a fairy tale.\n\n   And yet love will happen.\n   Of that I'm sure.\n\nAre we there yet ?\n\n   Here we go...\n   on a fantastic journey\n   of self discovery.\n\n   He told me:\n   \" Just grab a pen\n   and write whatever you feel.\n   Let it flow.\n   It's best\n   when you don't\n   premeditate your writing.\"\n\n   I should:\n   edit my writing,\n   not my ideas !\n\n   I should:\n   take my own advice.\n\n   But, I think,\n   that's easier said than done.\n   Don't I always try to think\n   of what I'm going to say next,\n   before I commit it to paper ?\n\n   But then I think,\n   \" What is good writing anyway ?\n   How will I know when I'm there ?\"\n\n   \"Are we there yet ?\"\n\nIt didn't really happen\n\n   You went down the street\n   just an ordinary day\n\n   you saw a young girl\n   innocent and sweet\n   talking to her dad\n   about everyday stuff\n\n   their freezer needed defrosting\n   happens everyday\n\n   did you really tell her\n   or did you just dream it\n   how to make a little... tiny... flame thrower ???\n\n   of course you didn't !!!\n   you're not that stupid,\n   and even if you did\n   you weren't serious.\n   she'd know that.\n\n   you'd never even tried\n   to make one yourself\n   but you'd heard it somewhere...\n   that you can make one\n   from an aerosol can and a flame\n\n   and she could even reach that freezer\n   if she just stands on a chair\n\n   ***\n\n   try telling her parents\n   try telling her\n   you weren't serious\n   you didn't even know\n   if it would work\n\n   try living with the memory of that scared little face\n   all covered with bandages\n   never the same again\n\n   ***\n\n   but don't worry\n   it was just a dream\n   it didn't really happen at all, did it ?\n\n   just keep telling yourself\n   it was all just a bad, bad dream.\n\nLovely Passenger\n\n   Here I sit,\n   on my bus,\n   seated behind\n   a vision divine.\n\n   She is young\n   and beautiful.\n   But mostly she is\n   a nubile,\n   young thing.\n\n   She looks\n   a little tired,\n   but young at heart.\n\n   She sneezes.\n   Will I say\n   \" Bless you\" ?\n   Perhaps not.\n\n   Oh, I pine for\n   the days when\n   she may have been mine.\n\n   She is truly\n   a vision of\n   loveliness, divine.\n\nLust\n\n   This morning,\n   on my bus,\n   travelling to work,\n   I passed a woman\n   sitting in her car.\n\n   She was very attractive,\n   I recall from\n   my two second glance.\n\n   lovely face,\n   and such nice,\n   long, black hair.\n\n   and did I crave for her ?\n   lust for her ?\n\n   have\n   rampant,\n   wanton,\n   lustful\n\n   desires for her ?\n\n   beg for\n   mad,\n   passionate,\n   non-stop\n   sex ?\n\n   why, no.\n   You do believe me, don't you ?\n\nLooking Good\n\n   She has:\n   Terrific tits,\n   Beautiful boobs,\n   Loverly lungs,\n   Magnificent mammaries,\n   Nice nipples,\n   and\n\n   a cute arse!\n\nCircular Poem\n\n   Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear,\n   ROW DEAR, ROW DEAR, ROW,\n   ROW,\n   ROW,\n   ROW,\n   STROKE, STROKE, STROKE,\n\n   oooh,\n   stroke,\n   stroke,\n   stroke,\n   oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.\n\nFrom Attitude to Gratitude\n\n   No longer do I have\n   the sheer luxury of\n   a do nothing,\n   be nobody,\n   go nowhere job.\n\n   It's good to have some real work to do.\n   But now, of course,\n   I have to work with\n   crappy computers and\n   a card file system that\n   have stood still in time.\n\n   As the world evolved\n   and got ready for\n   the next millenium,\n   we are stuck here in\n   a 70s time warp\n   with nothing but\n   dusty old shelves\n   and compactii\n   and junk\n   that belongs in a museum\n   to work with.\n\n   And still,\n   to get results\n   with antique systems\n   can give me\n   a feeling of self worth.\n\n   I do indeed lead a lucky life.\n   After all, I have a job\n   (with good conditions\n   and people too).\n\n   I keep my job,\n   and try my darndest\n   to do a good and honest job.\n   Because that is what\n   makes life worth living.\n\n   Good friends,\n   family,\n   co-workers,\n   and the satisfaction\n   of knowing that I will live\n   to enjoy life another day.\n\nPerhaps\n\n   Do I believe in God ?\n   That depends on what you mean by God.\n\n   Do I believe in life after death ?\n   That depends how you define life,\n   how you define existence.\n\n   Do I have a soul ?\n   I don't know how you define a soul,\n   but I suspect that I do.\n\n   I believe that there is something to look forward to\n   after death.\n\n   I believe that in some way, in some \"place\" the\n   souls of \"good men\" end up and exist together.\n\n   I don't know what or where it is,\n   But I'm looking forward to it - one day,\n   one eternity - perhaps.\n\nRemembered Turf\n\n   I've got the password\n   and I'm into the system.\n\n   It's precipitating wet stuff\n   out of the sky,\n   but I'm warm and\n   dry in here.\n\n   And tiM was blown away\n   by his wet suit,\n   the other day at the coast...\n\n   And now I'm just listening\n   to some jazzy kind of music,\n   playing on the stereo,\n\n   as we remember the amazing\n   turf sculptures\n   in Civic,\n   in some abandoned\n   bank office building,\n   now reclaimed as art space\n   for the common man.\n\nOne Tuesday in February\n\n   It's a beautiful day to be alive!\n   I have just stepped outside the building\n   on my lunch break\n   with a can of Coca-Cola\n   and now I can quietly relax\n   and enjoy sitting on a bench\n   in the sunshine and sit\n   and quietly sip on my drink.\n\n   The quietness is interrupted\n   by a helicopter flying overhead\n   for a moment.\n\n   A few more sips\n   and the caffeine\n   and chemical cocktail\n   begins to work,\n   to give me a \"rush\"\n   - or perhaps just a nudge.\n\n   One quick ten minute walk\n   around the buildings\n   and I'm half way\n   back to my building.\n\n   I'm a little puffed\n   but feeling good.\n   Better start heading back\n   to my office soon.\n\nOne Wednesday in March\n\n   I walk outside into the glorious day.\n   The sun shines brightly,\n   another lunch time,\n   another can of coke.\n\n   Sweet as honey.\n   Sickly sweet.\n   I find time to sit\n   in the shade,\n   enjoy the beautiful day\n   and sip the sweet nectar.\n\n   Such a change from\n   the stuffy offices -\n   air conditioned and\n   closed and\n   controlled climate.\n\nMy Brother. Oh brother...\n\n   I have a brother\n   who thinks that he understands\n   all about my condition.\n\n   But, deep down\n   I think that\n   he thinks that\n   my condition is\n   all caused by a combination of:\n\n   low self-esteem,\n   not thinking positively,\n   bad diet, and\n   a guilty conscience\n\n   (presumably about either\n   not working hard enough,\n   seeing prostitutes, or\n   forgetting birthdays, or\n   some crap like that).\n\n   He has lots of good intentions\n   but basically he can't\n   come to terms with\n   the fact that\n   I earn a good salary\n   (not unlike him)\n\n   but I spend all my money\n   (basically on myself)\n   with not much to show for it,\n   and he has a wife and\n   four kids to support.\n\n   If I mention on the phone\n   that I have to go down the street\n   to buy a few groceries,\n   then he will gladly spend\n   half an hour telling me about\n   his favourite recipe, and\n   what ingredients to buy to make it\n   (and how good it will be for me) -\n   even though I tell him that\n   I could not be less interested in his recipe.\n\n   Oh brother!\n\nReligion, sex, etc.\n\n   I have some ...\n   shall I say\n   unconventional views on religion.\n\n   I was touched by a Christian \"anecdote\",\n   for lack of a better thing to call it,\n   where, the story goes\n   that a man talks to god and\n   says (basically)\n\n   \"throughout my life\n   I have been walking along a beach,\n   and I saw two sets of footprints,\n   yours and mine.\n\n   But in the worst times of my life\n   I only saw one set of footprints.\n\n   Why did you abandon me God ?\"\n   And God replies\n   \" At those times,\n   I had not abandoned you,\n   I was carrying you!\n\n   You see I never abandoned you,\n   I was always there for you.\"\n\n   That story always gets me right there.\n\n   ***\n\n   But basically\n   I don't call myself a Christian.\n\n   I don't know if I believe in God,\n   but I believe that\n   there must be something after death.\n\n   I believe that the souls of good people\n   end up in some kind of eternity,\n\n   I would not exactly describe it as heaven,\n   in the Christian definition.\n\n   ***\n\n   I believe that the Bible lays out\n   some very good ideals of how to live\n   and how people should\n   live by being \"nice\" to each other\n   and so on,\n\n   but ultimately,\n   I guess I just don't buy all of that\n   fire and brimstone stuff,\n   and miracles left, right and centre.\n\n   I even found out a\n   little bit about Buddhism,\n   and liked some of the\n   stuff I found out,\n   until I found out that they have,\n   shall we say,\n   very strict views on\n   sexually and\n   what is sexually \"proper\"\n   (for the lack of another word).\n\n   ***\n\n   My sex life is\n   what I call normal,\n   if only slightly kinky.\n\n   I have a friend who I have an arrangement\n   to see when the want arises.\n   She is a prostitute and\n   one of my best friends.\n\n   She keeps telling me\n   that I am very special to her.\n\n   We are not exactly straight-laced\n   (neither of us),\n   but we know what we are doing and\n   we are both consenting adults and\n   that's really all that needs to be said.\n\n   ***\n\n   In the past I have been\n   betrayed by people,\n   workmates,\n   who I once trusted -\n\n   all in the name of\n   playing a practical joke,\n   to humiliate and\n   embarrass me about my private life.\n\n   I don't like what they did to me,\n   but I don't despise them for it either.\n   (I don't have the time or\n   energy to hate people).\n\n   I think that their actions only go\n   to prove just how shallow\n   they really are.\n\n   I don't work with these\n   people any more\n   (because they have moved on to other jobs).\n\nPokies\n\n   Here I am again\n   in the club.\n\n   Came for lunch,\n   stayed for a beer,\n   and to play\n   the one-armed bandits.\n\n   The victory jingles\n   of many machines\n   are deafening,\n   but they are not\n   playing for me.\n\n   So many times,\n   one off that\n   big prize.\n\n   Better to stop now\n   than later.\n\nTherefore\n\n   That is a poem\n   it is a lyric verse\n   all lyric verses are poetry,\n   therefore all poetry is lyric verse.\n\n   That is green\n   it is a blade of grass\n   all grass is green,\n   therefore all things green are grass.\n\nBill

an `orrible `ead,\n   but `orrible Sid\n   had an `orrible kid.\n   And that's enough\n   of this `orrible poem!\n\nWhat is love ? #1\n\n   Love is:\n   walking through the park\n   holding hands,\n   kissing,\n   cuddling,\n   hugging,\n   great sex.\n\n   No that's just a fantasy.\n   But it's a great fantasy\n   of mine,\n   and one that doesn't\n   impose any stereotypes on anyone.\n\n   So I'll hang onto it.\n\n   We  would  like  to  suggest that you try reading this poem backwards,\n   line by line.\n\nWhat is love ? #2\n\n   \"Love is a many splendid thing.\"\n   that's what someone said,\n   but don't ask me who.\n\n   Love is different things\n   for different people,\n\n   but for me,\n   love is about\n   being there\n   for someone special,\n   and about them\n   being there for me too.\n\n   I love my Mum & Dad,\n   and yes, my brother too,\n   and all his family,\n   and all my other relatives,\n\n   all my close friends,\n   and the other ones too,\n   who I only see now and then,\n\n   I love Annie on 2XX,\n   who I've never even met,\n   who just talks away\n   to me on the radio,\n   happy as can be,\n   brightening up my morning.\n\n   I love:\n   rock stars,\n   pop stars,\n   movie stars,\n   and lots of people\n   who I will never even know,\n   except through their publicity machines,\n\n   yet if you asked me,\n   I'd say,\n   \" Sure, I love:\n   Shania,\n   Alanis,\n   Pamela,\n   and Kim Hope too\"\n\n   and so many more,\n   whose names escape me,\n   leaving me with\n   only fleeting images,\n   from movies, TV, and magazines.\n\n   I love happy people,\n   and struggling souls,\n   and down-and-outs,\n   and just about everyone!\n\n   I love beautiful people,\n   and the rest too,\n   because beauty isn't about\n   size or shape,\n   it's about what's inside,\n   and what you think and do.\n\n   But I don't have\n   someone special in my life.\n   A lover,\n   to love,\n   and be loved by,\n   passionately,\n   sexually,\n   sensually!\n\n   so instead I dream on,\n   just loving life itself.\n\n   And yes, I go on loving\n   those girls\n   from bordellos too,\n   just occasionally.\n\n   Hey, I'm only human,\n   and I need loving too.\n   Or is that just sex & lust ?\n\n   I need loving,\n\n   I need love,\n\n   I love loving,\n\n   but don't ask me\n   what love is.\n\nAbout the Poet\n\n   Peter  Eric  Williams  was born on 1st of November, 1961, in Adelaide,\n   South Australia, and grew up in places which include: Adelaide, Berri,\n   Sydney,  Oro  Bay  (Papua),  Sydney  (again),  Canberra, Penang Island\n   (Malaysia);  before  then returning with his family to Canberra, where\n   he  finished  primary  school, then High School and College, living in\n   Lyneham.  He  then  got  a  job  with  the Department of Defence, as a\n   Trainee  Draftsman, just before turning 20, where he continues to work\n   to date (currently 1999), as a Technical Officer.\n\n   He  has  only  recently taken up writing poetry. When he enrolled in a\n   poetry  workshop last year, with the ACT Writers' Centre, he needed to\n   bring  a  sample of his own poetry to the workshop, and he didn't have\n   any, so he wrote the poem which became \"Nuts\" (in a shortened form) in\n   the  evening  before  the  workshop.  It  was  warmly  received in the\n   workshop,  and  thus  the  germ  of his poetry writing was planted and\n   grew. He continues to share his poetry with fellow poets at the Closet\n   Poets,  who  meet  twice  a month at the ACT Writers' Centre, and also\n   occassionally performs his work on radio 2XX.\n\n   Peter was diagnosed as a Schizophrenic approximately 15 years ago, and\n   now  leads  a relatively \"normal\" life, with his full-time job, and on\n   continual anti-psychotic medication. He lives in a rented, two bedroom\n   flat in the Canberra suburb of Hawker, where in his spare time he uses\n   his  personal  computer  for  the internet, programming and of course,\n   writing poetry and publishing it on his own personal web page.\n\n   A  large section of Peter's poetry appears on his personal home page (\n   http://members.fortunecity.com/pew ). Some of Peter's poetry currently\n   appears  on internet web site \"The Australian BDSM Information Site\" (\n   http://www.ozabis.info/stories_poetry.html  ),  in  the \"short stories\n   and poetry\" section.\n\n   Peter  said,  \"I  hope  that  this poetry will: amuse, bemuse, entice,\n   entertain,  delight, shock, inform, educate and inspire the readers of\n   these  pages.\" Read this book and you will discover some of the quirky\n   corners  of his mind, about what turns him on, turns him off, and what\n   turns him a little crazy...",
