    "body": "\n\nFAIRY GOLD\n\n\n\"Come and have a pint and talk it over,\" said Mr. Augustus Teak.  \"I've\ngot reasons in my 'ead that you don't dream of, Alf.\"\n\nMr. Chase grunted and stole a side-glance at the small figure of his\ncompanion.  \"All brains, you are, Gussie,\" he remarked.  \"That's why it\nis you're so well off.\"\n\n\"Come and have a pint,\" repeated the other, and with surprising ease\npushed his bulky friend into the bar of the \"Ship and Anchor.\"  Mr.\nChase, mellowed by a long draught, placed his mug on the counter and\neyeing him kindly, said--\n\n\"I've been in my lodgings thirteen years.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Mr. Teak; \"but I've got a partikler reason for wanting\nyou.  Our lodger, Mr. Dunn, left last week, and I only thought of you\nyesterday.  I mentioned you to my missis, and she was quite pleased.  You\nsee, she knows I've known you for over twenty years, and she wants to\nmake sure of only 'aving honest people in the 'ouse.  She has got a\nreason for it.\"\n\nHe closed one eye and nodded with great significance at his friend.\n\n\"Oh!\"  said Mr. Chase, waiting.\n\n\"She's a rich woman,\" said Mr. Teak, pulling the other's ear down to his\nmouth.  \"She--\"\n\n\"When you've done tickling me with your whiskers,\" said Mr. Chase,\nwithdrawing his head and rubbing his ear vigorously, \"I shall be glad.\"\n\nMr. Teak apologized.  \"A rich woman,\" he repeated.  \"She's been stinting\nme for twenty-nine years and saving the money--my money!--money that I\n'ave earned with the sweat of my brow.  She 'as got over three 'undred\npounds!\"\n\n\"'Ow much?\"  demanded Mr. Chase.\n\n\"Three 'undred pounds and more,\" repeated the other; \"and if she had 'ad\nthe sense to put it in a bank it would ha' been over four 'undred by this\ntime.  Instead o' that she keeps it hid in the 'Ouse.\"\n\n\"Where?\"  inquired the greatly interested Mr. Chase.\n\nMr. Teak shook his head.  \"That's just what I want to find out,\" he\nanswered.  \"She don't know I know it; and she mustn't know, either.\nThat's important.\"\n\n\"How did you find out about it, then?\"  inquired his friend.\n\n\"My wife's sister's husband, Bert Adams, told me.  His wife told 'im in\nstrict confidence; and I might 'ave gone to my grave without knowing\nabout it, only she smacked his face for 'im the other night.\"\n\n\"If it's in the house you ought to be able to find it easy enough,\" said\nMr. Chase.\n\n\"Yes, it's all very well to talk,\" retorted Mr. Teak.  \"My missis never\nleaves the 'ouse unless I'm with her, except when I'm at work; and if she\nthought I knew of it she'd take and put it in some bank or somewhere\nunbeknown to me, and I should be farther off it than ever.\"\n\n\"Haven't you got no idea?\"  said Mr. Chase.\n\n\"Not the leastest bit,\" said the other.  \"I never thought for a moment\nshe was saving money.  She's always asking me for more, for one thing;\nbut, then women alway do.  And look 'ow bad it is for her--saving money\nlike that on the sly.  She might grow into a miser, pore thing.  For 'er\nown sake I ought to get hold of it, if it's only to save her from\n'erself.\"\n\nMr. Chase's face reflected the gravity of his own.\n\n\"You're the only man I can trust,\" continued Mr. Teak, \"and I thought if\nyou came as lodger you might be able to find out where it is hid, and get\nhold of it for me.\"\n\n\"Me steal it, d'ye mean?\"  demanded the gaping Mr. Chase.  \"And suppose\nshe got me locked up for it?  I should look pretty, shouldn't I?\"\n\n\"No; you find out where it is hid,\" said the other; \"that's all you need\ndo.  I'll find someway of getting hold of it then.\"\n\n\"But if you can't find it, how should I be able to?\"  inquired Mr. Chase.\n\n\"'Cos you'll 'ave opportunities,\" said the other.  \"I take her out some\ntime when you're supposed to be out late; you come 'ome, let yourself in\nwith your key, and spot the hiding-place.  I get the cash, and give you\nten-golden-sovereigns--all to your little self.  It only occurred to me\nafter Bert told me about it, that I ain't been in the house alone for\nyears.\"\n\nHe ordered some more beer, and, drawing Mr. Chase to a bench, sat down to\na long and steady argument.  It shook his faith in human nature to find\nthat his friend estimated the affair as a twenty-pound job, but he was in\nno position to bargain.  They came out smoking twopenny cigars whose\nstrength was remarkable for their age, and before they parted Mr. Chase\nwas pledged to the hilt to do all that he could to save Mrs. Teak from\nthe vice of avarice.\n\nIt was a more difficult undertaking than he had supposed.  The house,\nsmall and compact, seemed to offer few opportunities for the concealment\nof large sums of money, and after a fortnight's residence he came to the\nconclusion that the treasure must have been hidden in the garden.  The\nunalloyed pleasure, however, with which Mrs. Teak regarded the efforts\nof her husband to put under cultivation land that had lain fallow for\ntwenty years convinced both men that they were on a wrong scent.  Mr.\nTeak, who did the digging, was the first to realize it, but his friend,\npointing out the suspicions that might be engendered by a sudden\ncessation of labour, induced him to persevere.\n\n\"And try and look as if you liked it,\" he said, severely.  \"Why, from the\nwindow even the back view of you looks disagreeable.\"\n\n\"I'm fair sick of it,\" declared Mr. Teak.  \"Anybody might ha' known she\nwouldn't have buried it in the garden.  She must 'ave been saving for\npretty near thirty years, week by week, and she couldn't keep coming out\nhere to hide it.  'Tain't likely.\"\n\nMr. Chase pondered.  \"Let her know, casual like, that I sha'n't be 'ome\ntill late on Saturday,\" he said, slowly.  \"Then you come 'ome in the\nafternoon and take her out.  As soon as you're gone I'll pop in and have\na thorough good hunt round.  Is she fond of animals?\"\n\n\"I b'lieve so,\" said the other, staring.  \"Why?\"\n\n\"Take 'er to the Zoo,\" said Mr. Chase, impressively.  \"Take two-penn'orth\no' nuts with you for the monkeys, and some stale buns for--for--for\nanimals as likes 'em.  Give 'er a ride on the elephant and a ride on the\ncamel.\"\n\n\"Anything else?\"  inquired Mr. Teak disagreeably.  \"Any more ways you can\nthink of for me to spend my money?\"\n\n\"You do as I tell you,\" said his friend.  \"I've got an idea now where it\nis.  If I'm able to show you where to put your finger on three 'undred\npounds when you come 'ome it'll be the cheapest outing you have ever 'ad.\nWon't it?\"\n\nMr. Teak made no reply, but, after spending the evening in deliberation,\nissued the invitation at the supper-table.  His wife's eyes sparkled at\nfirst; then the light slowly faded from them and her face fell.\n\n\"I can't go,\" she said, at last.  \"I've got nothing to go in.\"\n\n\"Rubbish!\"  said her husband, starting uneasily.\n\n\"It's a fact,\" said Mrs. Teak.  \"I should like to go, too--it's years\nsince I was at the Zoo.  I might make my jacket do; it's my hat I'm\nthinking about.\"\n\nMr. Chase, meeting Mr. Teak's eye, winked an obvious suggestion.\n\n\"So, thanking you all the same,\" continued Mrs. Teak, with amiable\ncheerfulness, \"I'll stay at 'ome.\"\n\n\"'Ow-'ow much are they?\"  growled her husband, scowling at Mr. Chase.\n\n\"All prices,\" replied his wife.\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Mr. Teak, in a grating voice.  \"You go in to buy a\nhat at one and eleven-pence; you get talked over and flattered by a man\nlike a barber's block, and you come out with a four-and-six penny one.\nThe only real difference in hats is the price, but women can never see\nit.\"\n\nMrs. Teak smiled faintly, and again expressed her willingness to stay at\nhome.  They could spend the afternoon working in the garden, she said.\nHer husband, with another indignant glance at the right eye of Mr. Chase,\nwhich was still enacting the part of a camera-shutter, said that she\ncould have a hat, but asked her to remember when buying it that nothing\nsuited her so well as a plain one.\n\nThe remainder of the week passed away slowly; and Mr. Teak, despite his\nutmost efforts, was unable to glean any information from Mr. Chase as to\nthat gentleman's ideas concerning the hiding-place.  At every suggestion\nMr. Chase's smile only got broader and more indulgent.\n\n\"You leave it to me,\" he said.  \"You leave it to me, and when you come\nhome from a happy outing I 'ope to be able to cross your little hand with\nthree 'undred golden quids.\"\n\n\"But why not tell me?\"  urged Mr. Teak.\n\n\"'Cos I want to surprise you,\" was the reply.  \"But mind, whatever you\ndo, don't let your wife run away with the idea that I've been mixed up in\nit at all.  Now, if you worry me any more I shall ask you to make it\nthirty pounds for me instead of twenty.\"\n\nThe two friends parted at the corner of the road on Saturday afternoon,\nand Mr. Teak, conscious of his friend's impatience, sought to hurry his\nwife by occasionally calling the wrong time up the stairs.  She came down\nat last, smiling, in a plain hat with three roses, two bows, and a\nfeather.\n\n\"I've had the feather for years,\" she remarked.  \"This is the fourth hat\nit has been on--but, then, I've taken care of it.\"\n\nMr. Teak grunted, and, opening the door, ushered her into the street.  A\nsense of adventure, and the hope of a profitable afternoon made his\nspirits rise.  He paid a compliment to the hat, and then, to the surprise\nof both, followed it up with another--a very little one--to his wife.\n\nThey took a tram at the end of the street, and for the sake of the air\nmounted to the top.  Mrs. Teak leaned back in her seat with placid\nenjoyment, and for the first ten minutes amused herself with the life in\nthe streets.  Then she turned suddenly to her husband and declared that\nshe had felt a spot of rain.\n\n\"'Magination,\" he said, shortly.\n\nSomething cold touched him lightly on the eyelid, a tiny pattering\nsounded from the seats, and then swish, down came the rain.  With an\nangry exclamation he sprang up and followed his wife below.\n\n\"Just our luck,\" she said, mournfully.  \"Best thing we can do is to stay\nin the car and go back with it.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\"  said her husband, in a startled' voice; \"it'll be over in a\nminute.\"\n\nEvents proved the contrary.  By the time the car reached the terminus it\nwas coming down heavily.  Mrs. Teak settled herself squarely in her seat,\nand patches of blue sky, visible only to the eye of faith and her\nhusband, failed to move her.  Even his reckless reference to a cab\nfailed.\n\n\"It's no good,\" she said, tartly.  \"We can't go about the grounds in a\ncab, and I'm not going to slop about in the wet to please anybody.  We\nmust go another time.  It's hard luck, but there's worse things in life.\"\n\nMr. Teak, wondering as to the operations of Mr. Chase, agreed dumbly.  He\nstopped the car at the corner of their road, and, holding his head down\nagainst the rain, sprinted towards home.  Mrs. Teak, anxious for her hat,\npassed him.\n\n\"What on earth's the matter?\"  she inquired, fumbling in her pocket for\nthe key as her husband executed a clumsy but noisy breakdown on the front\nstep.\n\n\"Chill,\" replied Mr. Teak.  \"I've got wet.\"\n\nHe resumed his lumberings and, the door being opened, gave vent to his\nrelief at being home again in the dry, in a voice that made the windows\nrattle.  Then with anxious eyes he watched his wife pass upstairs.\n\n\"Wonder what excuse old Alf'll make for being in?\"  he thought.\n\nHe stood with one foot on the bottom stair, listening acutely.  He heard\na door open above, and then a wild, ear-splitting shriek rang through the\nhouse.  Instinctively he dashed upstairs and, following his wife into\ntheir bedroom, stood by her side gaping stupidly at a pair of legs\nstanding on the hearthstone.  As he watched they came backwards into the\nroom, the upper part of a body materialized from the chimney, and turning\nround revealed the soot-stained face of Mr. Alfred Chase.  Another wild\nshriek from Mrs. Teak greeted its appearance.\n\n\"Hul-lo!\"  exclaimed Mr. Teak, groping for the right thing to say.\n\"Hul-lo!  What--what are you doing, Alf?\"\n\nMr. Chase blew the soot from his lips.  \"I--I--I come 'ome unexpected,\"\nhe stammered.\n\n\"But--what are--you doing?\"  panted Mrs. Teak, in a rising voice.\n\n\"I--I was passing your door,\" said Mr. Chase, \"passing your door--to go\nto my room to--to 'ave a bit of a rinse, when--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Teak.\n\nMr. Chase gave Mr. Teak a glance the pathos of which even the soot could\nnot conceal.  \"When I--I heard a pore little bird struggling in your\nchimbley,\" he continued, with a sigh of relief.  \"Being fond of animals,\nI took the liberty of comin' into your room and saving its life.\"\n\nMr. Teak drew a breath, which he endeavoured in vain to render noiseless.\n\n\"It got its pore little foot caught in the brickwork,\" continued the\nveracious Mr. Chase, tenderly.  \"I released it, and it flowed--I mean\nflew--up the chimbley.\"\n\nWith the shamefaced air of a man detected in the performance of a noble\naction, he passed out of the room.  Husband and wife eyed each other.\n\n\"That's Alf--that's Alf all over,\" said Mr. Teak, with enthusiasm.  \"He's\nbeen like it from a child.  He's the sort of man that 'ud dive off\nWaterloo Bridge to save the life of a drownding sparrow.\"\n\n\"He's made an awful mess,\" said his wife, frowning; \"it'll take me the\nrest of the day to clean up.  There's soot everywhere.  The rug is quite\nspoilt.\"\n\nShe took off her hat and jacket and prepared for the fray.  Down below\nMessrs.  Teak and Chase, comparing notes, sought, with much warmth, to\nput the blame on the right shoulders.\n\n\"Well, it ain't there,\" said Mr. Chase, finally.  \"I've made sure of\nthat.  That's something towards it.  I shan't 'ave to look there again,\nthank goodness.\"\n\nMr. Teak sniffed.  \"Got any more ideas?\"  he queried.\n\n\"I have,\" said the other sternly.  \"There's plenty of places to search\nyet.  I've only just begun.  Get her out as much as you can and I'll 'ave\nmy hands on it afore you can say--\"\n\n\"Soot?\"  suggested Mr. Teak, sourly.\n\n\"Any more of your nasty snacks and I chuck it up altogether,\" said Mr.\nChase, heatedly.  \"If I wasn't hard up I'd drop it now.\"\n\nHe went up to his room in dudgeon, and for the next few days Mr. Teak saw\nbut little of him.  To, lure Mrs. Teak out was almost as difficult as to\npersuade a snail to leave its shell, but he succeeded on two or three\noccasions, and each time she added something to her wardrobe.\n\nThe assistant fortune-hunter had been in residence just a month when Mr.\nTeak, returning home one afternoon, stood in the small passage listening\nto a suppressed wailing noise proceeding from upstairs.  It was so creepy\nthat half-way up he hesitated, and, in a stern but trembling voice,\ndemanded to know what his wife meant by it.  A louder wail than before\nwas the only reply, and, summoning up his courage, he pushed open the\ndoor of the bedroom and peeped in.  His gaze fell on Mrs. Teak, who was\nsitting on the hearth-rug, rocking to and fro in front of a dismantled\nfire-place.\n\n\"What--what's the matter?\"  he said, hastily.\n\nMrs. Teak raised her voice to a pitch that set his teeth on edge.  \"My\nmoney!\" she wailed.  \"It's all gone!  All gone!\"\n\n\"Money?\"  repeated Mr. Teak, hardly able to contain himself.  \"What\nmoney?\"\n\n\"All--all my savings!\"  moaned his wife.  \"Savings!\"  said the delighted\nMr. Teak.  \"What savings?\"\n\n\"Money I have been putting by for our old age,\" said his wife.  \"Three\nhundred and twenty-two pounds.  All gone!\"\n\nIn a fit of sudden generosity Mr. Teak decided then and there that Mr.\nChase should have the odd twenty-two pounds.\n\n\"You're dreaming!\"  he said, sternly.\n\n\"I wish I was,\" said his wife, wiping her eyes.  \"Three hundred and\ntwenty-two pounds in empty mustard-tins.  Every ha'penny's gone!\"\n\nMr. Teak's eye fell on the stove.  He stepped for ward and examined it.\nThe back was out, and Mrs. Teak, calling his attention to a tunnel at the\nside, implored him to put his arm in and satisfy himself that it was\nempty.\n\n\"But where could you get all that money from?\"  he demanded, after a\nprolonged groping.\n\n\"Sa--sa--saved it,\" sobbed his wife, \"for our old age.\"\n\n\"Our old age?\"  repeated Mr. Teak, in lofty tones.  \"And suppose I had\ndied first?  Or suppose you had died sudden?  This is what comes of\ndeceitfulness and keeping things from your husband.  Now somebody has\nstole it.\"\n\nMrs. Teak bent her head and sobbed again.  \"I--I had just been out for\n--for an hour,\" she gasped.  \"When I came back I fou--fou--found the\nwashhouse window smashed, and--\"\n\nSobs choked her utterance.  Mr. Teak, lost in admiration of Mr. Chase's\ncleverness, stood regarding her in silence.\n\n\"What--what about the police?\"  said his wife at last.\n\n\"Police!\"  repeated Mr. Teak, with extraordinary vehemence.  \"Police!\nCertainly not.  D'ye think I'm going to let it be known all round that\nI'm the husband of a miser?  I'd sooner lose ten times the money.\"\n\nHe stalked solemnly out of the room and downstairs, and, safe in the\nparlour, gave vent to his feelings in a wild but silent hornpipe.  He\ncannoned against the table at last, and, subsiding into an easy-chair,\ncrammed his handkerchief to his mouth and gave way to suppressed mirth.\n\nIn his excitement he forgot all about tea, and the bereaved Mrs. Teak\nmade no attempt to come downstairs to prepare it.  With his eye on the\nclock he waited with what patience he might for the arrival of Mr. Chase.\nThe usual hour for his return came and went.  Another hour passed; and\nanother.  A horrible idea that Mr. Chase had been robbed gave way to one\nmore horrible still.  He paced the room in dismay, until at nine o'clock\nhis wife came down, and in a languid fashion began to set the\nsupper-table.\n\n\"Alf's very late,\" said Mr. Teak, thickly.\n\n\"Is he?\"  said his wife, dully.\n\n\"Very late,\" said Mr. Teak.  \"I can't think--Ah, there he is!\"\n\nHe took a deep breath and clenched 'his hands together.  By the time Mr.\nChase came into the room he was able to greet him with a stealthy wink.\nMr. Chase, with a humorous twist of his mouth, winked back.\n\n\"We've 'ad a upset,\" said Mr. Teak, in warning tones.\n\n\"Eh?\" said the other, as Mrs. Teak threw her apron over her head and sank\ninto a chair.  \"What about?\"\n\nIn bated accents, interrupted at times by broken murmurs from his wife,\nMr. Teak informed him of the robbery.  Mr. Chase, leaning against the\ndoorpost, listened with open mouth and distended eyeballs.  Occasional\ninterjections of pity and surprise attested his interest.  The tale\nfinished, the gentlemen exchanged a significant wink and sighed in\nunison.\n\n\"And now,\" said Mr. Teak an hour later, after his wife had retired,\n\"where is it?\"\n\n\"Ah, that's the question,\" said Mr. Chase, roguishly.  \"I wonder where it\ncan be?\"\n\n\"I--I hope it's in a safe place,\" said Mr. Teak, anxiously.  \"Where 'ave\nyou put it?\"\n\n\"Me?\"  said Mr. Chase.  \"Who are you getting at?  I ain't put it\nanywhere.  You know that.\"\n\n\"Don't play the giddy goat,\" said the other, testily.  \"Where've you hid\nit?  Is it safe?\"\n\nMr. Chase leaned back in his chair and, shaking his head at him, smiled\napprovingly.  \"You're a little wonder, that's what you are, Gussie,\" he\nremarked.  \"No wonder your pore wife is took in so easy.\"\n\nMr. Teak sprang up in a fury.  \"Don't play the fool,\" he said hoarsely.\n\"Where's the money?  I want it.  Now, where've you put it?\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said Mr. Chase, with a chuckle.  \"Go on.  Don't mind me.  You\nought to be on the stage, Gussie, that's where you ought to be.\"\n\n\"I'm not joking,\" said Mr. Teak, in a trembling voice, \"and I don't want\nyou to joke with me.  If you think you are going off with my money,\nyou're mistook.  If you don't tell me in two minutes where it is, I shall\ngive you in charge for theft.\"\n\n\"Oh\" said Mr. Chase.  He took a deep breath.  \"Oh, really!\"  he said.  \"I\nwouldn't 'ave thought it of you, Gussie.  I wouldn't 'ave thought you'd\nhave played it so low down.  I'm surprised at you.\"\n\n\"You thought wrong, then,\" said the other.\n\n\"Trying to do me out o' my twenty pounds, that's what you are,\" said Mr.\nChase, knitting his brows.  \"But it won't do, my boy.  I wasn't born\nyesterday.  Hand it over, afore I lose my temper.  Twenty pounds I want\nof you, and I don't leave this room till I get it.\"\n\nSpeechless with fury, Mr. Teak struck at him.  The next moment the\nsupper-table was overturned with a crash, and Mr. Chase, with his friend\nin his powerful grasp, was doing his best, as he expressed it, to shake\nthe life out of him.  A faint scream sounded from above, steps pattered\non the stairs, and Mrs. Teak, with a red shawl round her shoulders, burst\n'hurriedly into the room.  Mr. Chase released Mr. Teak, opened his mouth\nto speak, and then, thinking better of it, dashed into the passage, took\nhis hat from the peg, and, slamming the front door with extraordinary\nviolence, departed.\n\nHe sent round for his clothes next day, but he did not see Mr. Teak until\na month afterwards.  His fists clenched and his mouth hardened, but Mr.\nTeak, with a pathetic smile, held out his hand, and Mr. Chase, after a\nmoment's hesitation, took it.  Mr. Teak, still holding his friend's hand,\npiloted him to a neighbouring hostelry.\n\n\"It was my mistake, Alf,\" he said, shaking his head, \"but it wasn't my\nfault.  It's a mistake anybody might ha' made.\"\n\n\"Have you found out who took it?\"  inquired Mr. Chase, regarding him\nsuspiciously.\n\nMr. Teak gulped and nodded.  \"I met Bert Adams yesterday,\" he said,\nslowly.  \"It took three pints afore he told me, but I got it out of 'im\nat last.  My missis took it herself.\"\n\nMr. Chase put his mug down with a bang.  \"What?\"  he gasped.\n\n\"The day after she found you with your head up the chimbley,\" added Mr.\nTeak, mournfully.  \"She's shoved it away in some bank now, and I shall\nnever see a ha'penny of it.  If you was a married man, Alf, you'd\nunderstand it better.  You wouldn't be surprised at anything.\"",
