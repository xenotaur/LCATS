    "body": "\"Hi-hi-hi!\" Big One shouted, and heaved erect with the front end of It.\n\n\"Hi-hi-hi,\" Fat One and the dozen others echoed more mildly, lifting\nwherever they could get a hold on It.\n\nIt was lifted and borne forward in a half crouching trot.\n\n\"Hi-hi hi-hi-hihihi,\" Elf chanted, running and skipping alongside the\npanting men and their massive burden.\n\nIt was carried forward through the lush grass for perhaps fifty feet.\n\n\"Ah-ah-ah,\" Big One sighed loudly, slowly letting the front end of It\ndown until it dug into the soft black soil.\n\n\"Ahhh,\" Fat One and the others sighed, letting go and standing up,\nstretching aching back muscles, rubbing cramped hands.\n\n\"Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah,\" Elf sang, running around and in between the\nresting men. He came too close to Big One and was sent sprawling by a\nquick, good humored push.\n\nEveryone laughed, Big One laughing the loudest. Then Big One lifted Elf\nto his feet and patted him on the back affectionately, a broad grin\nforming a toothy gap at the top of his bushy black beard.\n\nElf answered the grin with one of his own, and at that moment his ever\npresent yearning to grow up to be the biggest and the strongest like\nBig One flowed through him with new strength.\n\nAbruptly Big One leaped to the front end of It, shouting \"Hi-hi-HI!\"\n\n\"Hi-hi-hi,\" the others echoed, scrambling to their places. Once again\nIt was borne forward for fifty feet--and again and again, across the\nbroad meadowland.\n\nA vast matting of blackberry brambles came into view off to one side.\nBig One veered his course toward it. The going was uphill now, so the\nforward surges shortened to forty feet, then thirty. By the time they\nreached the blackberries they were wet and glossy with sweat.\n\nIt was a healthy patch, loaded with large ripe berries. The men ate\nhungrily at first, then more leisurely, pointing to one another's\nstained beards and laughing. As they denuded one area they leaped to\nIt, carried it another ten feet, and started stripping another section,\nnever getting more than a few feet from It.\n\nElf picked his blackberries with first one then another of the men.\nWhen his hunger was satisfied he became mischievous, picking a handful\nof berries and squashing them against the back or the chest of the\nnearest man and running away, laughing. It was dangerous sport, he\nknew, because if one of them caught him he would be tossed into the\nbrambles.\n\nEventually they all had their fill, and thanks to Elf looked as though\nthey were oozing blackberry juice from every pore. The sun was in its\nmid-afternoon position. In the distance a line of white-barked trees\ncould be seen--evidence of a stream.\n\n\"Hi-hi-hi!\" Big One shouted.\n\nThe journey toward the trees began. It was mostly downhill, so the\nforward spurts were often as much as a hundred feet.\n\nBefore they could hear the water they could smell it. They grunted\ntheir delight at the smell, a rich fish odor betokening plenty of food.\nIntermingled with this odor was the spicy scent of eucalyptus.\n\nThey pushed forward with renewed zeal so that the sweat ran down their\nskins, dissolving the berry juices and making rivulets that looked like\npurple blood.\n\nWhen less than a hundred yards from the stream, which was still hidden\nbeyond the tall grasses and the trees lining its bank, they heard the\nsound of voices, high pitched--women's voices. They became uneasy and\nnervous. Their surges forward shortened to ten feet, their rest periods\nbecame longer, they searched worriedly for signs of motion through the\ntrees.\n\nThey changed their course to arrive a hundred yards downstream from\nthe source of the women's voices. Soon they reached the edge of the\ntree belt. It was more difficult to carry It through the scatterings\nof bushes. Too, they would get part way through the trees and run into\ntrees too close together to get It past them, and have to back out and\ntry another place. It took almost two hours to work through the trees\nto the bank of the stream.\n\nOnly Elf recognized the place they finally broke through as the place\nthey had left more than two days before. In that respect he knew he\nwas different, not only from Big One and other grownups, but also all\nother Elfs except one, a girl Elf. He had known it as long as he could\nremember. He had learned it from many little things. For example, he\nhad recognized the place when they reached it. Big One and the others\nnever remembered anything for long. In getting It through the trees\nthey blundered as they always had, and got through by trial and error\nwith no memory of past blunderings.\n\nElf was different in another way, too. He could make more sounds\nthan the others. Sometimes he would keep a little It with him until\nit gave him a feeling of security almost as strong as the big It,\nthen wander off alone with It and play with making sounds. \"Bz-bz.\nWalla-walla-walla-rue-rue-la-lo-hi. Da!\" and all kinds of sounds. It\nexcited him to be able to make different sounds and put them together\nso that they pleased his hearing, but such sounds made the others avoid\nhim and look at him from a safe distance, with worried expressions, so\nhe had learned not to make _different_ sounds within earshot of the\nothers.\n\n\n\nThe women and Elfs were upstream a hundred yards, where they always\nremained. From the way they were milling around and acting alarmed it\nwas evident to Elf they could no more remember the men having been here\na few days before than the men could remember it themselves. It would\nbe two or three days before they slowly lost their fear of one another.\nIt would be the women and their Elfs who would cautiously approach,\nholding their portable Its clutched for security, until, finally losing\nall fear, they would join into one big group for a while.\n\nBig One and the others carried It right to the water's edge so they\ncould get into the water without ever being far from It. They shivered\nand shouted excitedly as they bathed. Fat One screamed with delight\nas he held a squirming fish up for the others to see. He bit into it\nwith strong white teeth, water dripping from his heavy brown beard.\nRenewed hunger possessed him. He gobbled the fish and began searching\nfor another. He always caught two fish for any other man's one, which\nwas why he was fat.\n\nElf himself caught a fish. After eating it he lay on the grassy bank\nlooking up at the white billowing clouds in the blue sky. The sun was\nnow near the horizon, half hidden behind a cloud, sending divergent\nramps of light downward. The clouds on the western horizon were slowly\ntaking on color until red, orange, and green separated into definite\nareas. The soft murmur of the stream formed a lazy background to the\nexcited voices of the men. From upstream, faintly, drifted the woman\nand Elf sounds.\n\nHere, close to the ground, the rich earthy smell was stronger than that\nof the stream. After a time a slight breeze sprang up, bringing with\nit other odors, that of distant pines, the pungent eucalyptus, a musky\nanimal scent.\n\nBig One and the others were out of the water, finally. Half asleep, Elf\nwatched them move It up to dry ground. As though that was what the sun\nhad been waiting for, it sank rapidly below the horizon.\n\nThe clouds where the sun had been seemed now to blaze for a time with a\nsmoldering redness that cooled to black. The stars came out, one by one.\n\nA multitude of snorings erupted into the night. Elf crept among the\nsleeping forms until he found Big One, and settled down for the night,\nhis head against Big One's chest, his right hand resting against the\ncool smooth metal of It.\n\n\n\nElf awoke with the bright morning sun directly in his eyes. Big One was\ngone, already wading in the stream after fish. Some of the others were\nwith him. A few were still sleeping.\n\nElf leaped to his feet, paused to stretch elaborately, then splashed\ninto the stream. As soon as he caught a fish he climbed out onto the\nbank and ate it. Then he turned to his search for a little It. There\nwere many lying around, all exactly alike. He studied several, not\ntouching some, touching and even nudging others. Since they all looked\nalike it was more a matter of _feel_ than any real difference that he\nlooked for. One and only one seemed to be the It. Elf returned his\nattention to it several times.\n\nFinally he picked it up and carried it over to the big It, and hid it\nunderneath. Big One, with shouts of sheer exuberance, climbed up onto\nthe bank dripping water. He grinned at Elf.\n\nElf looked in the direction of the women and other Elfs. Some of them\nwere wandering in his direction, each carrying an It of some sort, many\nof them similar to the one he had chosen.\n\nIn sudden alarm at the thought that someone might steal his new It, Elf\nrescued it from its hiding place. He tried to hide it behind him when\nany of the men looked his way. They scorned an individual It and, as\nmen, preferred an It too heavy for one person.\n\nAs the day advanced, women and Elfs approached nearer, pretending to be\nunaware at times that the men were here, at other times openly fleeing\nback, overcome by panic.\n\nThe men never went farther than twenty feet from the big It. But as the\nwomen came closer the men grew surly toward one another. By noon two of\nthem were trying to pick a fight with anyone who would stand up to them.\n\nElf clutched his little It closely and moved cautiously downstream\nuntil he was twenty feet from the big It. Tentatively he went another\nfew feet--farther than any of the men dared go from the big It.\nAt first he felt secure, then panic overcame him and he ran back,\ndropping the little It. He touched the big It until the panic was gone.\nAfter a while he went to the little It and picked it up. He walked\naround, carrying it, until he felt secure with it again. Finally he\nwent downstream again, twenty feet, twenty-five feet, thirty.... He\nfelt panic finally, but not overwhelmingly. When it became almost\nunendurable he calmly turned around and walked back.\n\nConfidence came to him. An hour later he went downstream until he was\nout of sight of the big It and the men. Security seemed to flow warmly\nfrom the little It.\n\nExcitement possessed Elf. He ran here and there, clutching It closely\nso as not to drop it and lose it. He felt _free_.\n\n\"Bdlboo,\" he said aloud, experimentally. He liked the sounds.\n\"Bdlboo--bdlboo--bdlboo.\" He saw a berry bush ahead and ran to it to\nmunch on the delicious fruit. \"Riddle piddle biddle,\" he said. It\nsounded nice.\n\nHe ran on, and after a time he found a soft grassy spot and stretched\nout on his back, holding It carelessly in one hand. He looked up and\nup, at a layer of clouds going in one direction and another layer above\nit going in another direction.\n\nSuddenly he heard voices.\n\nAt first he thought the wind must have changed so that it was carrying\nthe voices of the men to him. He lay there listening. Slowly he\nrealized these voices were different. They were putting sounds together\nlike those he made himself.\n\nA sense of wonder possessed him. How could there be anyone besides\nhimself who could do that?\n\nUnafraid, yet filled with caution, he clutched It closely to his chest\nand stole in the direction of the sounds.\n\nAfter going a hundred yards he saw signs of movement through the trees.\nHe dropped to the ground and lay still for a moment, then gained\ncourage to rise cautiously, ready to run. Stooping low, he stole\nforward until he could see several moving figures. Darting from tree to\ntree he moved closer to them, listening with greater excitement than he\nhad ever known to the smoothly flowing variety of beautiful sounds they\nwere making.\n\nThis was something new, a sort of game they must be playing. One voice\nwould make a string of sounds then stop, another would make a string of\ndifferent sounds and stop, a third would take it up. They were good at\nit, too.\n\nBut the closer he got to them the more puzzled he became. They were\nshaped somewhat like people, they carried Its, they had hands and faces\nlike people. That's as far as the similarity went. Their feet were\nsolid, their arms, legs, and body were not skin at all but strangely\ncolored and unliving in appearance. Their faces were smooth like\nwomen's, their hair short like babies', their voices deep like men's.\n\nAnd the Its they carried were unlike any Elf had ever seen. Not only\nthat, each of them carried more than one.\n\n_That_ was an _idea_! Elf became so excited he almost forgot to keep\nhidden. If you had more than one It, then if something happened to one\nyou would still feel secure!\n\nHe resisted the urge to return to the stream and search for another\nlittle It to give him extra security. If he did that he might never\nagain find these creatures that were so like men and yet so different.\nSo instead, he filed the idea away to use at the earliest opportunity\nand followed the strange creatures, keeping well hidden from them.\n\n\n\nSoon Elf could hear the shouts of the men in the distance. From the\nbehavior of the creatures ahead, they had heard those shouts too. They\nchanged their direction so as to reach the stream a hundred yards or\nmore downstream at about the spot where Elf had left. They made no\nvoice sounds now that Elf could hear. They clutched their strangely\nshaped long Its before them tensely as though feeling greater security\nthat way, their heads turning this way and that as they searched for\nany movement ahead.\n\nThey moved purposefully. An overwhelming sense of kinship brought tears\nto Elf's eyes. These creatures were _his kind_. Their differences\nfrom him were physical and therefore superficial, and even if those\ndifferences were greater it wouldn't have mattered.\n\nHe wanted, suddenly, to run to them. But the thought of it sent fear\nthrough him. Also they might run in panic from him if he suddenly\nrevealed himself.\n\nIt would have to be a mutual approach, he felt. He was used to seeing\nthem now. In due time he would reveal himself for a brief moment to\nthem. Later he would stay in the open and watch them, making no move to\napproach until they got used to him being around. It might take days,\nbut eventually, he felt sure, he could join them without causing them\nto panic.\n\nAfter all, there had been the time when he absented himself from the\nmen for three whole days and when he returned they had forgotten him,\nand his sudden appearance in their midst had sent even Big One into\nspasms of fear. Unable to flee from the security of the big It, and\nunable to bear his presence among them without being used to him, they\nhad all fallen on the ground in a fit. He had had to retreat and wait\nuntil they recovered. Then, slowly, he had let them get used to his\nbeing in sight before approaching again. It had taken two full days to\nget to the point where they would accept him once more.\n\nThat experience, Elf felt, would be valuable to remember now. He\nwouldn't want to plunge these creatures into fits or see them scatter\nand run away.\n\nAlso, he was too afraid right now to reveal himself even though every\natom of his being called for their companionship.\n\nSuddenly he made another important discovery. Some of the Its these\ncreatures carried had something like pliable vines attached to them so\nthey could be hung about the neck! The thought was so staggering that\nElf stopped and examined his It to see if that could be done to it. It\nwas twice as long as his hand and round one way, tapering to a small\nend that opened to the hollow inside. It was too smooth to hold with a\npliable vine unless--He visualized pliable vines woven together to hold\nIt. He wasn't sure how it could be done, but maybe it could.\n\nHe set the idea aside for the future and caught up with the creatures\nagain, looking at them with a new emotion, awe. The ideas he got just\nfrom watching them were so staggering he was getting dizzy!\n\nAnother new thought hit him. He rejected it at once as being too\nfantastic. It returned. Leaves are thin and pliable and can be wrapped\naround small objects like pebbles. Could it be that these creatures\nwere really men of some sort, with bodies like men, covered with\nsomething thin like leaves are thin? It was a new and dizzy height in\nportable securities, and hardly likely. No. He rejected the idea with\nfinality and turned his mind to other things.\n\nHe knew now where they could reach the stream. He decided to circle\nthem and get ahead of them. For the next few minutes this occupied his\nfull attention, leaving no room for crazy thoughts.\n\nHe reached the stream and hid behind some bushes where he would have a\nquick line of retreat if necessary. He clutched It tightly and waited.\nIn a few moments he saw the first of the creatures emerge a hundred\nfeet away. The others soon joined the first. Elf stole forward from\nconcealment to concealment until he was only fifteen feet from them.\nHis heart was pounding with a mixture of fear and excitement. His\nknuckles were white from clutching It.\n\nThe creatures were still carrying on their game of making sounds, but\nnow in an amazing new way that made them barely audible. Elf listened\nto the incredibly varied sounds, enraptured.\n\n\"This colony seems to have remained pure.\"\n\n\"You never can tell.\"\n\n\"No, you never can tell. Get out the binoculars and look, Joe.\"\n\n\"Not just yet, Harold. I'm looking to see if I can spot one whose\nbehavior shows intelligence.\"\n\nElf ached to imitate some of the beautiful combinations of sounds. He\nwanted to experiment and see if he could make the softly muted voices.\nHe had an idea how it might be done, not make a noise in your throat\nbut breathe out and form the sounds with your mouth just like you were\nuttering them aloud.\n\nOne of the creatures fumbled at an It hanging around his neck. The top\nof it hinged back. He reached in and brought out a gleaming It and held\nit so that it covered his eyes. He was facing toward the men upstream\nand stood up slowly.\n\n\"See something, Joe?\"\n\nSuddenly Elf was afraid. Was this some kind of magic? He had often\npuzzled over the problem of whether things were there when he didn't\nlook at them. He had experimented, closing his eyes then opening them\nsuddenly to see if things were still there, and they always were; but\nmaybe this was magic to make the men not be there. Elf waited, watching\nupstream, but Big One and the others did not vanish.\n\nThe one called Joe chuckled. \"The toy the adult males have would be a\nmuseum piece if it were intact. A 1960 Ford, I think. Only one wheel on\nit, right front.\"\n\nElf's attention jerked back. One of the creatures was reaching over his\nshoulder, lifting on the large It fastened there. The top of the It\npulled back. He reached inside, bringing out something that made Elf\nalmost exclaim aloud. It was shaped exactly like the little It Elf was\ncarrying, but it glistened in the sunlight and its interior was filled\nwith a richly brown fluid.\n\n\"Anyone else want a coke?\"\n\n\"This used to be a picnic area,\" the one called Joe said, not taking\nhis eyes from the binoculars. \"I can see a lot of pop bottles lying\naround in the general area of that wreck of a Ford.\"\n\nWhile Elf watched, breathless, the creature reached inside the skin of\nhis hip and brought out a very small It and did something to the small\nend of the hollow It. Putting the very small It back under the skin of\nhis hip, he put the hollow It to his lips and tilted it. Elf watched\nthe brown liquid drain out. Here was magic. Such an It--the very one he\ncarried--could be filled with water from the stream and carried around\nto drink any time!\n\nWhen the It held no more liquid the creature dropped it to the ground.\nElf could not take his eyes from it. He wanted it more than he had ever\nwanted anything. They might forget it. Sometimes the women dropped\ntheir Its and forgot them, picking up another one instead, and these\ncreatures had beardless faces like women. Besides, each of them carried\nso many Its that they would feel just as secure without this one.\n\nSo many Its! One of the creatures held a flat white It in one hand and\na very slim It shaped like a straight section of a bush stem, pointed\nat one end, with which he scratched on the white It at times, leaving\nblack designs.\n\n\"There're fourteen males,\" the one called Joe whispered. The other\nwrote it down.\n\nThe way these creatures did things, Elf decided, was very similar to\nthe way Big One and the other men went at moving the big It. They were\nvery much like men in their actions, these creatures.\n\n\"Eighty-five or six females.\"\n\n\"See any signs of intelligent action yet?\"\n\n\"No. A couple of the males are fighting. Probably going to be a mating\nfree-for-all tomorrow or next day. There's one! Just a minute, I want\nto make sure. It's a little girl, maybe eight or nine years old. Good\nforehead. Her eyes definitely lack that large marble-like quality\nof the sub-moron parent species. She's intelligent all right. She's\ndrawing something in the sand with a stick. Give me your rifle, Bill,\nit's got a better telescope sight on it than mine, and I don't want her\nto suffer.\"\n\nThat little It, abandoned on the ground. Elf wanted it. One of the\ncreatures would be sure to pick it up. Elf worried. He would never get\nit then. If only the creatures would go, or not notice him. If only--\n\nThe creature with the thing over his eyes put it back where he had\ngotten it out of the thing hanging from his shoulder. He had taken one\nof the long slim things from another of the creatures and placed the\nthick end against his shoulder, the small end pointed upstream. The\nothers were standing, their backs to Elf, all of them looking upstream.\nIf they would remain that way, maybe he could dart out and get the\nlittle It. In another moment they might lose interest in whatever they\nwere watching.\n\nElf darted out from his concealment and grabbed the It off the ground,\nand in the same instant an ear shattering sound erupted from the long\nslim thing against the creature's shoulder.\n\n\n\n\"Got her!\" the creature said.\n\nParalyzed with fright, Elf stood motionless. One of the creatures\nstarted to turn his way. At the last instant Elf darted back to his\nplace of concealment. His heart was pounding so loudly he felt sure\nthey would hear it.\n\n\"You sure, Joe?\"\n\n\"Right through the head. She never knew what happened.\"\n\nElf held the new It close to him, ready to run if he were discovered.\nHe didn't dare look at it yet. It wouldn't notice if he just held it\nand felt it without looking at it. It was cold at first, colder than\nthe water in the stream. Slowly it warmed. He dared to steal a quick\nglance at it. It gleamed at him as though possessed of inner life.\nA new feeling of security grew within him, greater than he had ever\nknown. The other It, the one half filled with dried mud, and deeply\nscratched from the violent rush of water over it when the stream went\nover its banks, lay forgotten at his feet.\n\n\"Well, that finishes the survey trip for this time.\"\n\nElf paid little attention to the voice whispers now, too wrapped up in\nhis new feelings.\n\n\"Yes, and quite a haul. Twenty-two colonies--three more than ten\nyears ago. Fourteen of them uncontaminated, seven with only one or two\nintelligent offspring to kill, only one colony so contaminated we had\nto wipe it out altogether. And one renegade.\"\n\n\"The renegades are growing scarcer every time. Another ten or twenty\nyears and they'll be extinct.\"\n\n\"Then there won't be any more intelligent offspring in these colonies.\"\n\n\"Let's get going. It'll be dark in another hour or so.\"\n\nThe creatures were hiding some of their Its under their skin, in their\ncarrying cases. There was a feeling about them of departure. Elf waited\nuntil they were on the move, back the way they had come, then he\nfollowed at a safe distance.\n\nHe debated whether to show himself now or wait. The sun was going down\nin the sky now. It wouldn't be long until it went down for the night.\nShould he wait until in the morning to let them get their first glimpse\nof him?\n\nHe smiled to himself. He had plenty of time. Tomorrow and tomorrow. He\nwould never return to Big One and the other men. Men or creatures, he\nwould join with these new and wonderful creatures. They were _his kind_.\n\nHe thought of the girl Elf. They were her kind, too. If he could only\nget her to come with him.\n\nOn sudden impulse he decided to try. These creatures were going back\nthe same way they had come. If he ran, and if she came right with him,\nthey could catch up with the creatures before they went so far they\nwould lose them.\n\nHe turned back, going carefully until he could no longer see the\ncreatures, then he ran. He headed directly toward the place where the\nwomen and Elfs stayed. They would not be so easily alarmed as the men\nbecause there were so many of them they couldn't remember one another,\nand one more or less of the Elfs went unnoticed.\n\n\n\nWhen he reached the clearing he slowed to a walk, looking for her.\nOrdinarily he didn't have to look much. She would see him and come to\nhim, smiling in recognition of the fact that he was the only one like\nher.\n\nHe became a little angry. Was she hiding? Then he saw her. He went to\nher. She was on her stomach, motionless as though asleep, but something\nwas different. There was a hole in one side of her head, and on the\nopposite side it was torn open, red and grayish white, with--He knelt\ndown and touched her. She had the same inert feel to her that others\nhad had who never again moved.\n\nHe studied her head curiously. He had never seen anything like this. He\nshook her. She remained limp. He sighed. He knew what would happen now.\nIt was already happening. The odor was very faint yet, but she would\nnot move again, and day after day the odor would get stronger. No one\nliked it.\n\nHe would have to hurry or he would lose the creatures. He turned and\nran, never looking back. Once he started to cry, then stopped in\nsurprise. Why had he been crying, he wondered. He hadn't hurt himself.\n\nHe caught up with the creatures. They were hurrying now, their long\nslender Its balanced on one shoulder, the big end resting in the palm\nof the hand. They no longer moved cautiously. Shortly it was new\ncountry. Elf had never been this far from the stream. Big One more or\nless led the men, and always more or less followed the same route in\ncross country trips.\n\nThe creatures didn't spend hours stumbling along impossible paths. They\nlooked ahead of them and selected a way, and took it. Also they didn't\nhave a heavy It to transport, fifty feet at a time. Elf began to sense\nthey had a destination in mind. Probably the place they lived.\n\n\n\nJust ahead was a steep bank, higher than a man, running in a long\nline. The creatures climbed the bank and vanished on the other side.\nCautiously Elf followed them, heading toward a large stone with It\nqualities at the top of the bank from whose concealment he could see\nwhere they had gone without being seen. He reached it and cautiously\npeeked around it. Just below him were the creatures, but what amazed\nElf was the sight of the big It.\n\nIt was very much like the big It the men had, except that there were\ndifferences in shape, and instead of one round thing at one corner, it\nhad one at each corner and rested on them so that it was held off the\nground. It glistened instead of being dull. It had a strange odor that\nwas quite strong.\n\nThe creatures were putting some of their Its into it, two of them had\nactually climbed into it--something neither Elf nor the men had ever\ndared to do with their own big It.\n\nElf took his eyes off of it for a moment to marvel at the ground. It\nseemed made of stone, but such stone as he had never before seen. It\nwas an even width with edges going in straight lines that paralleled\nthe long narrow hill on which he stood, and on the other side was a\nsimilar hill, extending as far as the eye could see.\n\nHe returned his attention to the creatures and their big It. The\ncreatures had all climbed into it now. Possibly they were settling down\nfor the night, though it was still early for that....\n\nNo matter. There was plenty of time. Tomorrow and tomorrow. Elf would\nshow himself in the morning, then run away. He would come back again\nafter a while and show himself a little longer, giving them time to get\nused to him so they wouldn't panic.\n\nThey were playing their game of making voice sounds to one another\nagain. It seemed their major preoccupation. Elf thought how much fun it\nwould be to be one of them, making voice sounds to his heart's content.\n\n\"I don't see why the government doesn't wipe out the whole lot,\" one of\nthem was saying. \"It's hopeless to keep them alive. Feeble-mindedness\nis dominant in them. They can't be absorbed into the race again, and\nany intelligent offspring they get from mating with a renegade would\nstart a long line of descendents, at least one fourth of whom would be\nmindless idiots.\"\n\n\"Well,\" another of them said, \"It's one of those things where there\nis no answer. Wipe them out, and next year it would be all the blond\nhaired people to be wiped out to keep the race of dark haired people\npure, or something. Probably in another hundred years nature will\ntake care of the problem by wiping them out for us. Meanwhile we game\nwardens must make the rounds every two years and weed out any of them\nwe can find that have intelligence.\" He looked up the embankment but\ndid not notice Elf's head, concealed partially by the grass around the\nconcrete marker. \"It's an easy job. Any of them we missed seeing this\ntime, we'll probably get next time. In the six or eight visits we make\nbefore the intelligent ones can become adults and mate we always find\nthem.\"\n\n\"What I hate is when they see us, those intelligent ones,\" a third\nvoice said. \"When they walk right up to us and want to be friends with\nus it's too much like plain murder, except that they can't talk, and\nonly make moronic sounds like 'Bdl-bdl-bdl.' Even so, it gets me when\nwe kill them.\" The others laughed.\n\nSuddenly Elf heard a new sound from the big It. It was not a voice\nsound, or if it was it was one that Elf felt he could not possibly\nmatch exactly. It was a growling, \"RRrrRRrrRRrr.\" Suddenly it was\nreplaced by still a different sound, a \"p-p-p-p-p\" going very rapidly.\nPerhaps it was the way these creatures snored. It was not unpleasant.\nElf cocked his head to one side, listening to the sound, smiling. How\nexciting it would be when he could join with these creatures! He wanted\nto so much.\n\nThe big It began to move. In the first brief second Elf could not\nbelieve his senses. How could it move without being carried? But it was\nmoving, and the creatures didn't seem to be aware of it! Or perhaps\nthey were too overcome by fear to leap out!\n\nAlready the big It was moving faster than a walk, and was moving faster\nwith every heartbeat. How could they remain unaware of it and not leap\nto safety?\n\nBelatedly Elf abandoned caution and leaped down the embankment to\nthe flat ribbon of rock, shouting. But already the big It was over a\nhundred yards away, and moving faster now than birds in flight!\n\nHe shouted, but the creatures didn't hear him--or perhaps they were so\novercome with fright that they were frozen. Yes, that must be it.\n\nElf ran after the big It. If he could only catch up with it he would\ngladly join the creatures in their fate. Better to die with them than\nto lose them!\n\nHe ran and ran, refusing to believe he could never overtake the big It,\neven when it disappeared from view, going faster than the wind. He ran\nand ran until his legs could lift no more.\n\nBlinded by tears, he tripped and sprawled full length on the wide\nribbon of stone. His nose bled from hitting the hard surface. His knees\nwere scraped and bleeding. He was unaware of this.\n\nHe was aware only that the creatures were gone, to what unimaginable\nfate he could not guess, but lost to him, perhaps forever.\n\nSobs welled up within him, spilled out, shaking his small naked body.\nHe cried as he hadn't cried since he was a baby.\n\nAnd the empty Coca Cola bottle clutched forgotten in his hand glistened\nwith the rays of the setting sun....",
