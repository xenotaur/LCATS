For such viands as your poet can provide,\n    (Which, as critics have occasionally stated,\n      Must be trying to a delicate inside,)\n    Once again are opportunities afforded\n      Of a banquet, or a _d\u00e9jeuner_ at least,\n    Once again your toleration is rewarded\n            By a literary feast!\n\n    You may think that Rudyard Kipling\u2019s work is stronger,\n      Or that Chaucer\u2019s may be rather more mature;\n    Byron\u2019s lyrics are indubitably longer,\n      Robert Browning\u2019s just a trifle more obscure;\n    But \u2019tis certain that no poems are politer,\n      Or more fitted for perusal in the home,\n    Than  the verses of the unassuming writer\n            Of this memorable tome!\n\n    Austin Dobson is a daintier performer,\n      Andrew Lang is far more scholarly and wise,\n    Mr. Swinburne can, of course, be somewhat warmer,\n      Alfred Austin more amusing, if he tries;\n    But there\u2019s no one in the world (and well you know it!)\n      Who can emulate the bard of whom we speak,\n    For the literary methods of _our_ poet\n            Are admittedly unique!\n\n    Tho\u2019 he shows no sort of penitence at breaking\n      Ev\u2019ry rule of English grammar and of style,\n    (Not a rhyme is too atrocious for his making,\n      Not a metre for his purpose is too vile!)\n    Tho\u2019 his treatment is essentially destructive,\n      And his taste a thing that no one can admire,\n    There is something incontestably seductive\n            In the music of his lyre!\n\n    Gentle Reader, some apologies are needed\n      For depositing this volume on your desk,\n    Since the author has undoubtedly exceeded\n      All the limits of legitimate burlesque,\n    And we look with very genuine affection\n      To a Public who, for better or for worse,\n    Will relieve us of this villainous collection\n            Of abominable verse!\n\n\n\n\n_Eve_\n\n\n    I always love to picture Eve,\n      Whatever captious critics say,\n    As one who was, as I believe,\n      The nicest woman of her day;\n    Attractive to the outward view,\n    And such a perfect _lady_ too!\n\n    Unselfish,--that one can\u2019t dispute,\n      Recalling her intense delight,\n    When she acquired some novel fruit,\n      In giving all her friends a bite;\n    Her very troubles she would share\n    With those who happened to be there.\n\n    Her wardrobe, though extremely small,\n      Sufficed a somewhat simple need;\n    She was, if anything at all,\n      A trifle _under_dressed, indeed,\n    And never visited a play\n    In headgear known as \u201cmatin\u00e9e.\u201d\n\n    Possessing but a single _beau_,\n      With only one _affaire de c[oe]ur_,\n    She promptly married, as we know,\n      The man who first proposed to her;\n    Not for his title or his pelf,\n    But simply for his own sweet self.\n\n    He loved her madly, at first sight;\n      His callow heart was quite upset;\n    He thought her nearly, if not quite,\n      The sweetest soul he\u2019d ever met;\n    She found him charming--for a man,\n    And so their young romance began.\n\n    Their wedding was a trifle tame--\n      A purely family affair--\n    No guests were asked, no pressmen came\n      To interview the happy pair;\n    No crowds of curious strangers bored them,\n    The \u201cEden Journal\u201d quite ignored them.\n\n    They had the failings of their class,\n      The faults and foibles of the youthful;\n    She was inquisitive, alas!\n      And he was--not exactly truthful;\n    But never was there man or woman\n    So truly, so intensely _human_!\n\n    And, hand in hand, from day to day,\n      They lived and labored, man and wife;\n    Together hewed their common way\n      Along the rugged path of Life;\n    Remaining, though the seasons pass\u2019d,\n    Friends, lovers, to the very last.\n\n    So, side by side, they shared, these two,\n      The sorrow and the joys of living;\n    The Man, devoted, tender, true,\n      The Woman, patient and forgiving;\n    Their common toil, their common weather,\n    But drew them closelier still together.\n\n    And if they ever chanced to grieve,\n      Enduring loss, or suff\u2019ring pain,\n    You may be certain it was Eve\n      Brought comfort to their hearts again;\n    If they were happy, well I know,\n    It was the Woman made them so.\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    And though the anthropologist\n      May mention, in his tactless way,\n    That Adam\u2019s weaknesses exist\n      Among our modern Men to-day,\n    In Women we may still perceive\n    The virtues of their Mother Eve!\n\n\n\n\n_Lady Godiva_\n\n\n    In the old town of Coventry, so people say,\n      Dwelt a Peer who was utterly lacking in pity;\n    Universally loathed for the rigorous way\n      That he burdened the rates of the City.\n    By his merciless methods of petty taxation,\n    The poor were reduced to the verge of starvation.\n\n    But the Earl had a wife, whom the people adored,\n      For her kindness of heart even more than her beauty,\n    And her pitiless lord she besought and implored\n      To remit this extortionate \u201cduty\u201d;\n    But he answered: \u201cMy dear, pray reflect at your leisure,\n    What _you_ deem a \u2018duty,\u2019 to _me_ is a pleasure!\u201d\n\n    At the heart of her spouse she continued to storm,\n      And she closed her entreaties, one day, by exclaiming:--\n    \u201cIf you take off the tax, I will gladly perform\n      Any task that you like to be naming!\u201d\n    \u201cWell, if that be the case,\u201d said the nobleman, \u201cI\u2019ve a\n    Good mind just to test you, my Lady Godiva!\n\n    \u201cTo your wishes, my dear, I will straight acquiesce,\n      On the single condition--I give you fair warning--\n    That you ride through the City, at noon, in the dress\n      That you wear in your bath of a morning!\u201d\n    \u201cVery well!\u201d she replied. \u201cBe it so! Though you drive a\n    Hard bargain, my lord,\u201d said the Lady Godiva.\n\n    So she slipped off her gown, and her shoulders lay bare,\n      Gleaming white like the moon on Aonian fountains;\n    When about them she loosened her curtain of hair,\n      \u2019Twas like Night coming over the mountains!\n    And she blushed, \u2019neath the veil of her wonderful tresses,\n    As blushes the Morn \u2019neath the Sun\u2019s first caresses!\n\n    Then she went to the stable and saddled her steed,\n      Who erected his ears, till he looked like a rabbit,\n    He was somewhat surprised, as he might be, indeed,\n      At the lady\u2019s unusual \u201chabit\u201d;\n    But allowed her to mount in the masculine way,\n    For he couldn\u2019t say \u201cNo,\u201d and he wouldn\u2019t say \u201cNeigh!\u201d\n\n    So she rode through the town, in the heat of the sun,\n      For the weather was (luckily) warm as the Tropics,\n    And the people all drew down their blinds--except one,\n      On the staff of the local \u201cTown Topics.\u201d\n    (Such misconduct produced in the eyes of this vile one\n    A cataract nearly as large as the Nile one!)\n\n    Then Godiva returned, and the Earl had to yield,\n      (And the paralyzed pressman dictated his cable;)\n    The tax was remitted, the bells were repealed,\n       And the horse was returned to the stable;\n    While banners were waved from each possible quarter,\n    Except from the flat of the stricken reporter.\n\n    Now the Moral is this--if I\u2019ve fathomed the tale\n      (Though it needs a more delicate pen to explain it):--\n    You can get whatsoever you want, without fail,\n      If you\u2019ll sacrifice _all_ to obtain it.\n    You should _try_ to avoid unconventional capers,\n    And be sure you don\u2019t write for Society papers.\n\n\n\n\n_Miss Marie Corelli_\n\n\n    A very Woman among Men!\n      Her p\u00e6ans, sung in ev\u2019ry quarter,\n    Almost persuade Le Gallienne\n      To go and get his hair cut shorter;\n    When Kipling hears her trumpet-note\n    He longs to don a petticoat.\n\n    Her praise is sung by old or young,\n      From Happy Hampstead to Hoboken,\n    Where\u2019er old England\u2019s mother-tongue\n      Is (ungrammatically) spoken:\n    In that supremely simple set\n    Which loves the penny novelette.\n\n    When Anglo-Saxon peoples kneel\n      Before their literary idol,\n    It makes all rival authors feel\n      Depressed and almost suicidal;\n    They cannot reach within a mile\n    Of her sublime suburban style.\n\n    Her modest, unobtrusive ways,\n      In sunny Stratford\u2019s guide-books graven,\n    Her brilliance, lighting with its rays\n      The birthplace of the Swan of Avon,\n    Must cause the Bard as deep a pain\n    As his resemblance to Hall Caine.\n\n    Mere ordinary mortals ask,\n      With no desire for picking quarrels,\n    Who gave her the congenial task\n      Of judging other people\u2019s morals?\n    Who bade her flay her fellow-men\n    With such a frankly feline pen?\n\n    And one may seek, and seek in vain.\n      The social set she loves to mention,\n    Those offspring of her fertile brain,\n      Those creatures of her fond invention.\n    (She is, or so it would appear,\n    Unlucky in her friends, poor dear!)\n\n    For tho\u2019, like her, they feel the sway\n      Of claptrap sentimental glamour,\n    And frequently, like her, give way\n      To lapses from our English grammar,\n    The victims of her diatribes\n    Are not the least as she describes.\n\n    To restaurants they seldom go,\n      Just for the sake of over-eating;\n    While ladies don\u2019t play bridge, you know,\n      Entirely for the sake of cheating;\n    And husbands can be quite nice men,\n    And wives _are_ faithful, now and then.\n\n    Were she to mingle with her ink\n      A little milk of human kindness,\n    She would not join, I dare to think,\n      To chronic social color-blindness\n    An outlook bigoted and narrow\n    As that of some provincial sparrow.\n\n    But still, perhaps, it might affect\n      Her literary circulation,\n    If she were tempted to neglect\n      Her talent for vituperation;\n    Since work of this peculiar kind\n    Delights the groundling\u2019s curious mind.\n\n    For while, of course, from day to day,\n      Her popularity increases,\n    As, in an artless sort of way,\n      She tears Society to pieces,\n    Her sense of humor, so they tell us,\n    Makes even Alfred Austin jealous!\n\n    Yet even bumpkins, by and by,\n      (Such is the spread of education)\n    May view with cold, phlegmatic eye\n      The fruits of her imagination,\n    And learn to temper their devotion\n    With slight, if adequate, emotion.\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    Dear Miss Corelli:--Should your eyes\n      Peruse this page (\u2019tis my ambition!),\n    Be sure that I apologize\n      In any suitable position\n    For having weakly imitated\n    The style that you yourself created.\n\n    I cannot fancy to attain\n      To heights of personal invective\n    Which you, with subtler pen and brain,\n      Have learnt to render so effective;\n    I follow dimly in your trail;\n    Forgive me, therefore, if I fail!\n\n\n\n\n_Mrs. Mary Baker Eddy_\n\n\n    Have you a pain all down your back?\n      A feeling of intense prostration?\n    Are you an\u00e6mic, for the lack\n            Of proper circulation?\n    With bloodshot eye and hand unsteady?\n    Pray send at once for Mrs. Eddy.\n\n    The Saint and Prophetess is she\n      Of what is known as Christian Science;\n    And you can lean on Mrs. E.\n            With absolute reliance;\n    For she will shortly make it plain\n    That there is no such thing as pain.\n\n    The varied ailments on your list\n      Which cause you such extreme vexation\n    Are nothing more, she will insist,\n            Than mere imagination.\n    \u2019Tis so with illness or disease;\n    Nothing exists ... except her fees!\n\n    A friend of mine had not been taught\n      This doctrine, I regret to say.\n    He fell downstairs, or so he thought,\n            And broke his neck, one day.\n    Had Mrs. Eddy come along,\n    She could have shown him he was wrong.\n\n    She could have told him (or his wraith)\n      That stairs and necks have no existence,\n    That persons with sufficient faith\n            Can fall from any distance,\n    And that he wasn\u2019t in the least\n    What local papers called \u201cdeceased.\u201d\n\n    Of ills to which the flesh is heir\n      She is decidedly disdainful;\n    But once, or so her friends declare,\n            Her teeth became so painful\n    That, tho\u2019 she knew they couldn\u2019t be,\n    She had them taken out, to see.\n\n    Afflictions of the lame or halt,\n      Which other people view with terror,\n    To her denote some moral fault,\n            Some form of mental error.\n    While doctors probe or amputate,\n    She simply heals you while you wait.\n\n    My brother, whom you may have seen,\n      Possessed a limp, a very slight one;\n    His leg, the left, had always been\n            Much shorter than the right one;\n    But Mrs. Eddy came his way,\n    And ... well, just look at him to-day!\n\n    At healing she had grown so deft\n      That when she finished with my brother,\n    His crippled leg, I mean the left,\n            Was _longer_ than the other!\n    And now he\u2019s praying, day and night,\n    For faith to lengthen out the right.\n\n    So let it be our chief concern\n      To set diseases at defiance,\n    Contriving, as the truths we learn\n            Of so-called Christian Science,\n    To live from illnesses exempt,--\n    Or else to die in the attempt!\n\n\n\n\n_Mrs. Grundy_\n\n\n    When lovely Woman stoops to smoke\n      (A vice in which she often glories),\n    Or sees the somewhat doubtful joke\n            In after-dinner stories,\n    Who is it to her bedroom rushes\n    To hide the fervor of her blushes?\n\n    When Susan\u2019s skirt\u2019s a trifle short,\n      Or Mary\u2019s manner rather skittish,\n    Who is it, with a fretful snort\n            (So typically British),\n    Emits prolonged and startled cries,\n    Suggestive of a pained surprise?\n\n    Who is it, tell me, in effect,\n      Who loves to centre her attentions\n    On all who wilfully neglect\n            Society\u2019s conventions,\n    And seems eternally imbued\n    With saponaceous rectitude?\n\n    \u2019Tis Mrs. Grundy, deaf and blind\n      To anything the least romantic,\n    Combining with a narrow mind\n            A point of view pedantic,\n    Since no one in the world can stop her\n    From thinking ev\u2019rything improper.\n\n    The picture or the marble bust\n      At any public exhibition\n    Evokes her unconcealed disgust\n            And rouses her suspicion,\n    If human forms are shown to us\n    _In puris naturalibus_.\n\n    The bare, in any sense or shape.\n      She looks upon as wrong or faulty;\n    Piano-legs she likes to drape,\n            If they are too d\u00e9coll\u2019t\u00e9;\n    For long with horror she has viewed\n    The naked Truth, for being nude.\n\n    On modern manners that efface\n      The formal modes of introduction\n    She is at once prepared to place\n            The very worst construction,--\n    And frowns, suspicious and sardonic,\n    On friendships that are termed Platonic.\n\n    The English restaurants must close\n      At twelve o\u2019clock at night on Sunday,\n    To suit (or so we may suppose)\n            The taste of Mrs. Grundy;\n    On week-days, thirty minutes later,\n    Ejected guests revile the waiter.\n\n    A sense of humor she would vote\n      The sign of mental dissipations;\n    She scorns whatever might promote\n            The gaiety of nations;\n    Of lawful fun she seems no fonder\n    Than of the noxious _dooblontonder_!\n\n    And if you wish to make her blench\n      And snap her teeth together tightly,\n    Say something in Parisian French,\n            And close one optic slightly.\n    \u201cRien ne va plus! Enfin, alors!\u201d\n    She leaves the room and slams the door!\n\n    O Mrs. Grundy, do, I beg,\n      To false conclusions cease from rushing,\n    And learn to name the human leg\n

 Let \u201cWhat will Mrs. Grundy say?\u201d\n            No longer have its terrors;\n    Leave diatribe and objurgation\n    To Mrs. Chant and Carrie Nation!\n\n\n\n\n_Mrs. Christopher Columbus_\n\n\n    The bride grows pale beneath her veil,\n      The matron, for the nonce, is dumb,\n    Who listens to the tragic tale\n      Of Mrs. Christopher Columb:\n    Who lived and died (so says report)\n    A widow of the herbal sort.\n\n    Her husband upon canvas wings\n      Would brave the Ocean, tempest-tost;\n    He had a cult for finding things\n      Which nobody had ever lost,\n    And Mrs. C. grew almost frantic\n    When he discovered the Atlantic.\n\n    But nothing she could do or say\n      Would keep her Christopher at home;\n    Without delay he sailed away\n      Across what poets call \u201cthe foam,\u201d\n    While neighbors murmured, \u201cWhat a shame!\u201d\n    And wished their husbands did the same.\n\n    He ventured on the highest C\u2019s\n      That reared their heads above the bar,\n    Knowing the compass and the quays\n      Like any operatic star;\n    And funny friends who watched him do so\n    Would call him \u201cRobinson Caruso.\u201d\n\n    But Mrs. C. remained indoors,\n      And poked the fire and wound the clocks,\n    Amused the children, scrubbed the floors,\n      Or darned her absent husband\u2019s socks.\n    (For she was far too sweet and wise\n    To darn the great explorer\u2019s eyes.)\n\n    And when she chanced to look around\n      At all the couples she had known,\n    And realized how few had found\n      A home as peaceful as her own,\n    She saw how pleasant it may be\n    To wed a chronic absentee.\n\n    Her husband\u2019s absence she enjoyed,\n      Nor ever asked him where he went,\n    Thinking him harmlessly employed\n      Discovering some Continent.\n    Had he been always in, no doubt,\n    Some day she would have found him out.\n\n    And so he daily left her side\n      To travel o\u2019er the ocean far,\n    And she who, like the bard, had tried\n      To \u201chitch her wagon to a star,\u201d\n    Though she was harnessed to a comet,\n    Got lots of satisfaction from it.\n\n    To him returning from the West\n      She proved a perfect anti-dote,\n    Who loosed his Armour (beef compress\u2019d)\n      And sprayed his \u201cautomobile throat\u201d;\n    His health she kept a jealous eye on,\n    And played PerUna to his lion!\n\n    And when she got him home again,\n      And so could wear the jewels rare\n    Which Isabella, Queen of Spain,\n      Entrusted to her husband\u2019s care,\n    Her monetary wealth was \u201cfar\n    Beyond the dreams of caviar!\u201d\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    A melancholy thing it is\n      How few have known or understood\n    The manifold advantages\n      Of such herbaceous widowhood!\n    (What is it ruins married lives\n    But husbands ... not to mention wives?)\n\n    O wedded couples of to-day,\n      Pray take these principles to heart,\n    And copy the Columbian way\n      Of living happily apart.\n    And so, to you, at any rate,\n    Shall marriage be a \u201cbless\u00e8d state.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n_Dame Rumor_\n\n\n    I should like to remark that Dame Rumor\n      Is the most unalluring of jades.\n    She has little or no sense of humor,\n      And her fables are worse than George Ade\u2019s.\n    (Or rather, I mean, if the reader prefers,\n    That the fables of Ade are much _better_ than hers!)\n\n    Her appearance imbues one with loathing,\n      From her jaundiced, malevolent eyes\n    To the tinsel she cares to call clothing,\n      Which is merely a patchwork of lies.\n    For her garments are such that a child could see through,\n    And her blouse (need I add?) is the famed Peek-a-boo!\n\n    She is wholly devoid of discretion,\n      She is utterly wanting in tact,\n    She\u2019s a gossip by trade and profession,\n      And she much prefers fiction to fact.\n    She is seldom veracious, and always unkind,\n    And she moves to and fro with the speed of the wind.\n\n    She resembles the men who (\u2019tis fabled)\n      Tumble into the Packingtown vats,\n    Who are boiled there, and bottled, and labelled\n      For the tables of true democrats:\n    Pickled souls who are canned for the public to buy,\n    And (like her) have a finger in every pie!\n\n    With a step that is silent and stealthy,\n      Or an earsplitting clamor and noise,\n    She disturbs the repose of the wealthy,\n      Or the peace which the pauper enjoys.\n    And, however securely the doors may be shut,\n    She can always gain access to palace or hut.\n\n    Where the spinsters at tea are collected,\n      Her arrival is hailed with delight;\n    She is welcomed, adored, and respected\n      In each newspaper office at night;\n    For her presence imprints an original seal\n    On an otherwise commonplace journal or meal.\n\n    She has nothing in common with Virtue,\n      And with Truth she was never allied;\n    If she hasn\u2019t yet managed to hurt you,\n      It can\u2019t be from not having tried!\n    For the poison of adders is under her tongue,\n    And you\u2019re lucky indeed, if you\u2019ve never been stung.\n\n    Are you statesman, or author, or artist,\n      With a perfectly blameless career?\n    Are your talents and wits of the smartest,\n      And your conscience abnormally clear?\n    \u201cHe\u2019s a saint!\u201d says Dame Rumor, and smiles like the Sphinx.\n    \u201cHe\u2019s a hero!\u201d (She adds:) \u201cWhat a pity he drinks!\u201d\n\n    Gentle Reader, keep clear of her clutches!\n      O beware of her voice, I entreat!\n    Be you journalist, dowager duchess,\n      Or just merely the Man in the Street.\n    And I beg of you not to encourage a jade\n    Who, if once she is started, can _never_ be stayed.\n\n\n\n\n_The Cry of the Children_\n\n    [On the subject of infant education it has been suggested that\n    more advantageous results might be obtained if, instead of\n    filling children\u2019s minds with such nonsense as fairy-tales,\n    stories were read to them about Julius C\u00e6sar.]\n\n\n    O my Brothers, do you hear the children weeping?\n    Do you note the teardrops tumbling from their eyes?\n    To the school-house they reluctantly are creeping,\n\n      Discontented with the teaching it supplies.\n    At the quality of modern education\n      Little urchins may with justice look askance,\n    Since it panders to a child\u2019s imagination,\n        And encourages romance.\n\n    Do you see that toddling baby with a bib on,\n      How his eyes with silent misery are dim?\n    He is yearning for the chance of reading Gibbon;\n      But his teachers give him nothing else but Grimm!\n    What a handicap to infantile ambition!\n      \u2019Tis enough to make the brightest bantling fume,\n    To be gammoned with an Andrew Lang edition,\n        When he longs for Hume, sweet Hume!\n\n    See that tiny one, what boredom he expresses!\n      What intolerance his frequent yawns evince\n    Of the fairy-tales where beautiful princesses\n      Are delivered from a dragon by a prince!\n    How he curses the pedantic institution\n      Where he can\u2019t obtain such volumes as \u201cLe Cid,\u201d\n    Or that masterpiece on \u201cSocial Evolution\u201d\n        By another kind of Kidd!\n\n    Do you hear the children weeping, O my Brothers?\n      They are crying for Max M\u00fcller and Carlyle.\n    Tho\u2019 Hans Andersen may satisfy their mothers,\n      They are weary of so immature a style.\n    And their time is far too brief to be expended\n      On such nonsense as their \u201crude forefathers\u201d read;\n    For they know the days of sentiment are ended,\n        And that Chivalry is dead!\n\n    Oh remember that the pillars of the nation\n      Are the children that we discipline to-day;\n    That to give them a becoming education\n      You must rear them in a reasonable way!\n    Let us guard them from the glamour of the mystics,\n      Who would throw a ray of sunshine on their lives!\n    Let us feed each helpless atom on statistics,\n        And pray Heaven he survives!\n\n    Let us cast away the out-of-date traditions,\n      Which our poets and romanticists have sung!\n    Let us sacrifice the senseless superstitions\n      That illuminate the fancies of the young!\n    If we limit our instruction to the \u201creals,\u201d\n      We may prove to ev\u2019ry baby from the start,\n    The futility of cherishing ideals\n        In his golden little heart!\n\n\n\n\n_The Cry of the Elders_\n\n    [With
