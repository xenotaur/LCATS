    "body": "\n\nTHE VIGIL\n\n\"I'm the happiest man in the world,\" said Mr. Farrer, in accents of\ndreamy tenderness.\n\nMiss Ward sighed.  \"Wait till father comes in,\" she said.\n\nMr. Farrer peered through the plants which formed a welcome screen to\nthe window and listened with some uneasiness.  He was waiting for the\nfirm, springy step that should herald the approach of ex-Sergeant-Major\nWard. A squeeze of Miss Ward's hand renewed his courage.\n\n\"Perhaps I had better light the lamp,\" said the girl, after a long\npause. \"I wonder where mother's got to?\"\n\n\"She's on my side, at any rate,\" said Mr. Farrer.\n\n\"Poor mother!\"  said the girl.  \"She daren't call her soul her own.  I\nexpect she's sitting in her bedroom with the door shut.  She hates\nunpleasantness.  And there's sure to be some.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" said the young man, with a slight shiver.  \"But why should\nthere be any?  He doesn't want you to keep single all your life, does\nhe?\"\n\n\"He'd like me to marry a soldier,\" said Miss Ward.  \"He says that the\nyoung men of the present day are too soft.  The only thing he thinks\nabout is courage and strength.\"\n\nShe rose and, placing the lamp on the table, removed the chimney, and\nthen sought round the room for the matches.  Mr. Farrer, who had two\nboxes in his pocket, helped her.\n\nThey found a box at last on the mantelpiece, and Mr. Farrer steadied her\nby placing one arm round her waist while she lit the lamp.  A sudden\nexclamation from outside reminded them that the blind was not yet drawn,\nand they sprang apart in dismay as a grizzled and upright old warrior\nburst into the room and confronted them.\n\n\"Pull that blind down!\"  he roared.  \"Not you,\" he continued, as Mr.\nFarrer hastened to help.  \"What do you mean by touching my blind?  What\ndo you mean by embracing my daughter?  Eh?  Why don't you answer?\"\n\n\"We--we are going to be married,\" said Mr. Farrer, trying to speak\nboldly.\n\nThe sergeant-major drew himself up, and the young man gazed in dismay at\na chest which seemed as though it would never cease expanding.\n\n\"Married!\" exclaimed the sergeant-major, with a grim laugh.  \"Married to\na little tame bunny-rabbit!  Not if I know it.  Where's your mother?\"\nhe demanded, turning to the girl.\n\n\"Upstairs,\" was the reply.\n\nHer father raised his voice, and a nervous reply came from above.  A\nminute later Mrs. Ward, pale of cheek, entered the room.\n\n\"Here's fine goings-on!\"  said the sergeant major, sharply.  \"I go for a\nlittle walk, and when I come back this--this infernal cockroach has got\nits arm round my daughter's waist.  Why don't you look after her?  Do\nyou know anything about it?\"\n\nHis wife shook her head.\n\n\"Five feet four and about thirty round the chest, and wants to marry my\ndaughter!\" said the sergeant-major, with a sneer.  \"Eh?  What's that?\nWhat did you say?  What?\"\n\n\"I said that's a pretty good size for a cockroach,\" murmured Mr. Farrer,\ndefiantly.  \"Besides, size isn't everything.  If it was, you'd be a\ngeneral instead of only a sergeant-major.\"\n\n\"You get out of my house,\" said the other, as soon as he could get his\nbreath.  \"Go on Sharp with it.\"\n\n\"I'm going,\" said the mortified Mr. Farrer.  \"I'm sorry if I was rude. I\ncame on purpose to see you to-night.  Bertha--Miss Ward, I mean--told me\nyour ideas, but I couldn't believe her.  I said you'd got more common\nsense than to object to a man just because he wasn't a soldier.\"\n\n\"I want a man for a son-in-law,\" said the other.  \"I don't say he's got\nto be a soldier.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" said Mr. Farrer.  \"You're a man, ain't you?  Well, I'll do\nanything that you'll do.\"\n\n\"Pph!\" said the sergeant-major.  \"I've done my little lot.  I've been in\naction four times, and wounded in three places.  That's my tally.\"\n\n\"The colonel said once that my husband doesn't know what fear is,\" said\nMrs. Ward, timidly.  \"He's afraid of nothing.\"\n\n\"Except ghosts,\" remarked her daughter, softly.\n\n\"Hold your tongue, miss,\" said her father, twisting his moustache.  \"No\nsensible man is afraid of what doesn't exist.\"\n\n\"A lot of people believe they do, though,\" said Mr. Farrer, breaking in.\n\"I heard the other night that old Smith's ghost has been seen again\nswinging from the apple tree.  Three people have seen it.\"\n\n\"Rubbish!\" said the sergeant-major.\n\n\"Maybe,\" said the young man; \"but I'll bet you, Mr. Ward, for all your\ncourage, that you won't go up there alone at twelve o'clock one night to\nsee.\"\n\n\"I thought I ordered you out of my house just now,\" said the sergeant-\nmajor, glaring at him.\n\n\"Going into action,\" said Mr. Farrer, pausing at the door, \"is one thing\n--you have to obey orders and you can't help yourself; but going to a\nlonely cottage two miles off to see the ghost of a man that hanged\nhimself is another.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say I'm afraid?\" blustered the other.\n\nMr. Farrer shook his head.  \"I don't say anything,\" he remarked; \"but\neven a cockroach does a bit of thinking sometimes.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you'd like to go,\" said the sergeant-major.\n\n\"I don't mind,\" said the young man; \"and perhaps you'll think a little\nbetter of me, Mr. Ward.  If I do what you're afraid to do--\"\n\nMrs. Ward and her daughter flung themselves hastily between the\nsergeant-major and his intended sacrifice.  Mr. Farrer, pale but\ndetermined, stood his ground.\n\n\"I'll dare you to go up and spend a night there alone,\" he said.\n\n\"I'll dare you,\" said the incensed warrior, weakly.\n\n\"All right; I'll spend Wednesday night there,\" said Mr. Farrer, \"and\nI'll come round on Thursday and let you know how I got on.\"\n\n\"I dare say,\" said the other; \"but I don't want you here, and, what's\nmore, I won't have you.  You can go to Smith's cottage on Wednesday at\ntwelve o'clock if you like, and I'll go up any time between twelve and\nthree and make sure you're there.  D'ye understand?  I'll show you\nwhether I'm afraid or not.\"\n\n\"There's no reason for you to be afraid,\" said Mr. Farrer.  \"I shall be\nthere to protect you.  That's very different to being there alone, as I\nshall be.  But, of course, you can go up the next night by yourself, and\nwait for me, if you like.  If you like to prove your courage, I mean.\"\n\n\"When I want to be ordered about,\" said the sergeant-major, in a\nmagnificent voice, \"I'll let you know.  Now go, before I do anything I\nmight be sorry for afterwards.\"\n\nHe stood at the door, erect as a ramrod, and watched the young man up\nthe road.  His conversation at the supper-table that night related\nalmost entirely to puppy-dogs and the best way of training them.\n\nHe kept a close eye upon his daughter for the next day or two, but human\nnature has its limits.  He tried to sleep one afternoon in his easy-\nchair with one eye open, but the exquisite silence maintained by Miss\nWard was too much for it.  A hum of perfect content arose from the\nfeature below, and five minutes later Miss Ward was speeding in search\nof Mr. Farrer.\n\n\"I had to come, Ted,\" she said, breathlessly, \"because to-morrow's\nWednesday.  I've got something to tell you, but I don't know whether I\nought to.\"\n\n\"Tell me and let me decide,\" said Mr. Farrer, tenderly.\n\n\"I--I'm so afraid you might be frightened,\" said the girl.  \"I won't\ntell you, but I'll give you a hint.  If you see anything awful, don't be\nfrightened.\"\n\nMr. Farrer stroked her hand.  \"The only thing I'm afraid of is your\nfather,\" he said, softly.\n\n\"Oh!\" said the girl, clasping her hands together.  \"You have guessed\nit.\"\n\n\"Guessed it?\" said Mr. Farrer.\n\nMiss Ward nodded.  \"I happened to pass his door this morning,\" she said,\nin a low voice.  \"It was open a little way, and he was standing up and\nmeasuring one of mother's nightgowns against his chest.  I couldn't\nthink what he was doing it for at first.\"\n\nMr. Farrer whistled and his face hardened.\n\n\"That's not fair play,\" he said at last.  \"All right; I'll be ready for\nhim.\"\n\n\"He doesn't like to be put in the wrong,\" said Miss Ward.  \"He wants to\nprove that you haven't got any courage.  He'd be disappointed if he\nfound you had.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Mr. Farrer again.  \"You're an angel for coming to tell\nme.\"\n\n\"Father would call me something else, I expect,\" said Miss Ward, with a\nsmile.  \"Good-bye.  I want to get back before he wakes up.\"\n\nShe was back in her chair, listening to her father's slumbers, half an\nhour before he awoke.\n\n\"I'm making up for to-morrow night,\" he said, opening his eyes suddenly.\n\nHis daughter nodded.\n\n\"Shows strength of will,\" continued the sergeant-major, amiably.\n\"Wellington could go to sleep at any time by just willing it.  I'm the\nsame way; I can go to sleep at five minutes' notice.\"\n\n\"It's a very useful gift,\" said Miss Ward, piously, \"very.\"\n\nMr. Ward had two naps the next day.  He awoke from the second at twelve-\nthirty a.m., and in a somewhat disagreeable frame of mind rose and\nstretched himself.  The house was very still.  He took a small brown-\npaper parcel from behind the sofa and, extinguishing the lamp, put on\nhis cap and opened the front door.\n\nIf the house was quiet, the little street seemed dead.  He closed the\ndoor softly and stepped into the darkness.  In terms which would have\nbeen understood by \"our army in Flanders\" he execrated the forefathers,\nthe name, and the upbringing of Mr. Edward Farrer.\n\nNot a soul in the streets; not a light in a window.  He left the little\ntown behind, passed the last isolated house on the road, and walked into\nthe greater blackness of a road between tall hedges.  He had put on\ncanvas shoes with rubber soles, for the better surprise of Mr. Farrer,\nand his own progress seemed to partake of a ghostly nature.  Every ghost\nstory he had ever heard or read crowded into his memory.  For the first\ntime in his experience even the idea of the company of Mr. Farrer seemed\nbetter than no company at all.\n\nThe night was so dark that he nearly missed the turning that led to the\ncottage.  For the first few yards he had almost to feel his way; then,\nwith a greater yearning than ever for the society of Mr. Farrer, he\nstraightened his back and marched swiftly and noiselessly towards the\ncottage.\n\nIt was a small, tumble-down place, set well back in an overgrown garden.\nThe sergeant-major came to a halt just before reaching the gate, and,\nhidden by the hedge, unfastened his parcel and shook out his wife's best\nnightgown.\n\nHe got it over his head with some difficulty, and, with his arms in the\nsleeves, tried in vain to get his big hands through the small, lace-\ntrimmed wristbands.  Despite his utmost efforts he could only get two or\nthree fingers through, and after a vain search for his cap, which had\nfallen off in the struggle, he made his way to the gate and stood there\nwaiting.  It was at this moment that the thought occurred to him that\nMr. Farrer might have failed to keep the appointment.\n\nHis knees trembled slightly and he listened anxiously for any sound from\nthe house.  He rattled the gate and, standing with white arms\noutstretched, waited.  Nothing happened.  He shook it again, and then,\npulling himself together, opened it and slipped into the garden.  As he\ndid so a large bough which lay in the centre of the footpath\nthoughtfully drew on one side to let him pass.\n\nMr. Ward stopped suddenly and, with his gaze fixed on the bough, watched\nit glide over the grass until it was swallowed up in the darkness.  His\nown ideas of frightening Mr. Farrer were forgotten, and in a dry,\nchoking voice he called loudly upon the name of that gentleman.\n\nHe called two or three times, with no response, and then, in a state of\npanic, backed slowly towards the gate with his eyes fixed on the house.\nA loud crash sounded from somewhere inside, the door was flung violently\nopen, and a gruesome figure in white hopped out and squatted on the\nstep.\n\nIt was evident to Sergeant-Major Ward that Mr. Farrer was not there, and\nthat no useful purpose could be served by remaining.  It was clear that\nthe young man's courage had failed him, and, with grey head erect,\nelbows working like the sails of a windmill, and the ends of the\nnightgown streaming behind him, the sergeant-major bent his steps\ntowards home.\n\nHe dropped into a walk after a time and looked carefully over his\nshoulder.  So far as he could see he was alone, but the silence and\nloneliness were oppressive.  He looked again, and, without stopping to\ninquire whether his eyes had deceived him, broke into a run again.\nAlternately walking and running, he got back to the town, and walked\nswiftly along the streets to his house.  Police-Constable Burgess, who\nwas approaching from the other direction, reached it at almost the same\nmoment, and, turning on his lantern, stood gaping with astonishment.\n\"Anything wrong?\"  he demanded.\n\n\"Wrong?\"  panted the sergeant-major, trying to put a little surprise and\ndignity into his voice.  \"No.\"\n\n\"I thought it was a lady walking in her sleep at first,\" said the\nconstable.  \"A tall lady.\"\n\nThe sergeant-major suddenly became conscious of the nightgown.  \"I've\nbeen--for a little walk,\" he said, still breathing hard.  \"I felt a bit\nchilly--so I--put this on.\"\n\n\"Suits you, too,\" said the constable, stiffly.  \"But you Army men always\nwas a bit dressy.  Now if I put that on I should look ridikerlous.\"\n\nThe door opened before Mr. Ward could reply, and revealed, in the light\nof a bedroom candle, the astonished countenances of his wife and\ndaughter.\n\n\"George!\"  exclaimed Mrs. Ward.\n\n\"Father!\"  said Miss Ward.\n\nThe sergeant-major tottered in and, gaining the front room, flung\nhimself into his arm-chair.  A stiff glass of whisky and water, handed\nhim by his daughter, was swallowed at a gulp.\n\n\"Did you go?\"  inquired Mrs. Ward, clasping her hands.\n\nThe sergeant-major, fully conscious of the suspicions aroused by his\ndisordered appearance, rallied his faculties.  \"Not likely,\" he said,\nwith a short laugh.  \"After I got outside I knew it was no good going\nthere to look for that young snippet.  He'd no more think of going there\nthan he would of flying.  I walked a little way down the road--for\nexercise--and then strolled back.\"\n\n\"But--my nightgown?\"  said the wondering Mrs. Ward.\n\n\"Put it on to frighten the constable,\" said her husband.\n\nHe stood up and allowed her to help him pull it off.  His face was\nflushed and his hair tousled, but the bright fierceness of his eye was\nunquenched.  In submissive silence she followed him to bed.\n\nHe was up late next morning, and made but a poor breakfast.  His after-\ndinner nap was disturbed, and tea was over before he had regained his\nwonted calm.  An hour later the arrival of a dignified and reproachful\nMr. Farrer set him blazing again.\n\n\"I have come to see you about last night,\" said Mr. Farrer, before the\nother could speak.  \"A joke's a joke, but when you said you would come I\nnaturally expected you would keep your word.\"\n\n\"Keep my word?\"  repeated the sergeant-major, almost choking with wrath.\n\n\"I stayed there in that lonely cottage from twelve to three, as per\nagreement, waiting for you,\" said Mr. Farrer.\n\n\"You were not there,\" shouted the sergeant-major.\n\n\"How do you know?\"  inquired the other.\n\nThe sergeant-major looked round helplessly at his wife and daughter.\n\n\"Prove it,\" said Mr. Farrer, pushing his advantage.  \"You questioned my\ncourage, and I stayed there three hours.  Where were you?\"\n\n\"You were not there,\" said the sergeant-major.  \"I know.  You can't\nbluff me.  You were afraid.\"\n\n\"I was there, and I'll swear it,\" said Mr. Farrer.  \"Still, there's no\nharm done.  I'll go there again to-night, and I'll dare you to come for\nme?\"\n\n\"Dare?\" said the sergeant-major, choking.  \"Dare?\"\n\n\"Dare,\" repeated the other; \"and if you don't come this time I'll spread\nit all over Marcham.  To-morrow night you can go there and wait for me.\nIf you see what I saw--\"\n\n\"Oh, Ted!\"  said Miss Ward, with a shiver.  \"Saw?\" said the sergeant-\nmajor, starting.  \"Nothing harmful,\" said Mr. Farrer, calmly.\n\n\"As a matter of fact, it was very interesting.\"\n\n\"What was?\" demanded the sergeant-major.\n\n\"It sounds rather silly, as a matter of fact,\" said Mr. Farrer, slowly.\n\"Still, I did see a broken bough moving about the garden.\"\n\nMr. Ward regarded him open-mouthed.\n\n\"Anything else?\"  he inquired, in a husky voice.\n\n\"A figure in white,\" said Mr. Farrer, \"with long waving arms, hopping\nabout like a frog.  I don't suppose you believe me, but if you come to-\nnight perhaps you'll see it yourself.  It's very interesting.\n\n\"Wer--weren't you frightened?\"  inquired the staring Mrs. Ward.\n\nMr. Farrer shook his head.  \"It would take more than that to frighten\nme,\" he said, simply.  \"I should be ashamed of myself to be afraid of a\npoor thing like that.  It couldn't do me any harm.\"\n\n\"Did you see its face?\"  inquired Mrs. Ward, nervously.\n\nMr. Farrer shook his head.\n\n\"What sort of a body had it got?\"  said her daughter.\n\n\"So far as I could see, very good,\" said Mr. Farrer.  \"Very good figure\n--not tall, but well made.\"\n\nAn incredible suspicion that had been forming in the sergeant-major's\nmind began to take shape.  \"Did you see anything else?\"  he asked,\nsharply.\n\n\"One more,\" said Mr. Farrer, regarding him pleasantly.  \"One I call the\nRunning Ghost.\"\n\n\"Run--\" began the sergeant-major, and stopped suddenly.\n\n\"It came in at the front gate,\" pursued Mr. Farrer.  \"A tall, well-knit\nfigure of martial bearing--much about your height, Mr. Ward--with a\nbeautiful filmy white robe down to its knees--\"\n\nHe broke off in mild surprise, and stood gazing at Miss Ward, who, with\nher handkerchief to her mouth, was rocking helplessly in her chair.\n\n\"Knees,\" he repeated, quietly.  \"It came slowly down the path, and half\nway to the house it stopped, and in a frightened sort of voice called\nout my name.  I was surprised, naturally, but before I could get to it--\nto reassure it--\"\n\n\"That'll do,\" said the sergeant-major, rising hastily and drawing\nhimself up to his full height.\n\n\"You asked me,\" said Mr. Farrer, in an aggrieved voice.\n\n\"I know I did,\" said the sergeant-major, breathing heavily.  \"I know I\ndid; but if I sit here listening to any more of your lies I shall be\nill. The best thing you can do is to take that giggling girl out and\ngive her a breath of fresh air.  I have done with her.\"",
