It is in him, in his blood and bones and soul; he will carry\n    Earth within him forever.\"\n\n\n\"No,\" said the old man.\n\n\"But you don't realize what it means,\" said Jorun. \"You don't know what\nyou're saying.\"\n\nThe old man, Kormt of Huerdar, Gerlaug's son, and Speaker for Solis\nTownship, shook his head till the long, grizzled locks swirled around\nhis wide shoulders. \"I have thought it through,\" he said. His voice was\ndeep and slow and implacable. \"You gave me five years to think about it.\nAnd my answer is no.\"\n\nJorun felt a weariness rise within him. It had been like this for days\nnow, weeks, and it was like trying to knock down a mountain. You beat on\nits rocky flanks till your hands were bloody, and still the mountain\nstood there, sunlight on its high snow-fields and in the forests that\nrustled up its slopes, and it did not really notice you. You were a\nbrief thin buzz between two long nights, but the mountain was forever.\n\n\"You haven't thought at all,\" he said with a rudeness born of\nexhaustion. \"You've only reacted unthinkingly to a dead symbol. It's not\na human reaction, even, it's a verbal reflex.\"\n\nKormt's eyes, meshed in crow's-feet, were serene and steady under the\nthick gray brows. He smiled a little in his long beard, but made no\nother reply. Had he simply let the insult glide off him, or had he not\nunderstood it at all? There was no real talking to these peasants; too\nmany millennia lay between, and you couldn't shout across that gulf.\n\n\"Well,\" said Jorun, \"the ships will be here tomorrow or the next day,\nand it'll take another day or so to get all your people aboard. You have\nthat long to decide, but after that it'll be too late. Think about it, I\nbeg of you. As for me, I'll be too busy to argue further.\"\n\n\"You are a good man,\" said Kormt, \"and a wise one in your fashion. But\nyou are blind. There is something dead inside you.\"\n\nHe waved one huge gnarled hand. \"Look around you, Jorun of Fulkhis. This\nis _Earth_. This is the old home of all humankind. You cannot go off and\nforget it. Man cannot do so. It is in him, in his blood and bones and\nsoul; he will carry Earth within him forever.\"\n\nJorun's eyes traveled along the arc of the hand. He stood on the edge of\nthe town. Behind him were its houses--low, white, half-timbered, roofed\nwith thatch or red tile, smoke rising from the chimneys; carved\ngalleries overhung the narrow, cobbled, crazily-twisting streets; he\nheard the noise of wheels and wooden clogs, the shouts of children at\nplay. Beyond that were trees and the incredible ruined walls of Sol\nCity. In front of him, the wooded hills were cleared and a gentle\nlandscape of neat fields and orchards rolled down toward the distant\nglitter of the sea: scattered farm buildings, drowsy cattle, winding\ngravel roads, fence-walls of ancient marble and granite, all dreaming\nunder the sun.\n\nHe drew a deep breath. It was pungent in his nostrils. It smelled of\nleaf-mould, plowed earth baking in the warmth, summery trees and\ngardens, a remote ocean odor of salt and kelp and fish. He thought that\nno two planets ever had quite the same smell, and that none was as rich\nas Terra's.\n\n\"This is a fair world,\" he said slowly.\n\n\"It is the only one,\" said Kormt. \"Man came from here; and to this, in\nthe end, he must return.\"\n\n\"I wonder--\" Jorun sighed. \"Take me; not one atom of my body was from\nthis soil before I landed. My people lived on Fulkhis for ages, and\nchanged to meet its conditions. They would not be happy on Terra.\"\n\n\"The atoms are nothing,\" said Kormt. \"It is the form which matters, and\nthat was given to you by Earth.\"\n\nJorun studied him for a moment. Kormt was like most of this planet's ten\nmillion or so people--a dark, stocky folk, though there were more blond\nand red-haired throwbacks here than in the rest of the Galaxy. He was\nold for a primitive untreated by medical science--he must be almost two\nhundred years old--but his back was straight, and his stride firm. The\ncoarse, jut-nosed face held an odd strength. Jorun was nearing his\nthousandth birthday, but couldn't help feeling like a child in Kormt's\npresence.\n\nThat didn't make sense. These few dwellers on Terra were a backward and\nimpoverished race of peasants and handicraftsmen; they were ignorant and\nunadventurous; they had been static for more thousands of years than\nanyone knew. What could they have to say to the ancient and mighty\ncivilization which had almost forgotten their little planet?\n\nKormt looked at the declining sun. \"I must go now,\" he said. \"There are\nthe evening chores to do. I will be in town tonight if you should wish\nto see me.\"\n\n\"I probably will,\" said Jorun. \"There's a lot to do, readying the\nevacuation, and you're a big help.\"\n\n\n\nThe old man bowed with grave courtesy, turned, and walked off down the\nroad. He wore the common costume of Terran men, as archaic in style as\nin its woven-fabric material: hat, jacket, loose trousers, a long staff\nin his hand. Contrasting the drab blue of Kormt's dress, Jorun's vivid\ntunic of shifting rainbow hues was like a flame.\n\nThe psychotechnician sighed again, watching him go. He liked the old\nfellow. It would be criminal to leave him here alone, but the law\nforbade force--physical or mental--and the Integrator on Corazuno wasn't\ngoing to care whether or not one aged man stayed behind. The job was to\nget the _race_ off Terra.\n\n_A lovely world._ Jorun's thin mobile features, pale-skinned and\nlarge-eyed, turned around the horizon. _A fair world we came from._\n\nThere were more beautiful planets in the Galaxy's swarming myriads--the\nindigo world-ocean of Loa, jeweled with islands; the heaven-defying\nmountains of Sharang; the sky of Jareb, that seemed to drip light--oh,\nmany and many, but there was only one Earth.\n\nJorun remembered his first sight of this world, hanging free in space to\nwatch it after the gruelling ten-day run, thirty thousand light-years,\nfrom Corazuno. It was blue as it turned before his eyes, a burnished\nturquoise shield blazoned with the living green and brown of its lands,\nand the poles were crowned with a flimmering haze of aurora. The belts\nthat streaked its face and blurred the continents were cloud, wind and\nwater and the gray rush of rain, like a benediction from heaven. Beyond\nthe planet hung its moon, a scarred golden crescent, and he had wondered\nhow many generations of men had looked up to it, or watched its light\nlike a broken bridge across moving waters. Against the enormous cold of\nthe sky--utter black out to the distant coils of the nebulae, thronging\nwith a million frosty points of diamond-hard blaze that were the\nstars--Earth had stood as a sign of haven. To Jorun, who came from\nGalactic center and its uncountable hosts of suns, heaven was bare, this\nwas the outer fringe where the stars thinned away toward hideous\nimmensity. He had shivered a little, drawn the envelope of air and\nwarmth closer about him, with a convulsive movement. The silence drummed\nin his head. Then he streaked for the north-pole rendezvous of his\ngroup.\n\n_Well_, he thought now, _we have a pretty routine job. The first\nexpedition here, five years ago, prepared the natives for the fact\nthey'd have to go. Our party simply has to organize these docile\npeasants in time for the ships._ But it had meant a lot of hard work,\nand he was tired. It would be good to finish the job and get back home.\n\nOr would it?\n\nHe thought of flying with Zarek, his team-mate, from the rendezvous to\nthis area assigned as theirs. Plains like oceans of grass, wind-rippled,\ndarkened with the herds of wild cattle whose hoofbeats were a thunder in\nthe earth; forests, hundreds of kilometers of old and mighty trees,\nrivers piercing them in a long steel gleam; lakes where fish leaped;\nspilling sunshine like warm rain, radiance so bright it hurt his eyes,\ncloud-shadows swift across the land. It had all been empty of man, but\nstill there was a vitality here which was almost frightening to Jorun.\nHis own grim world of moors and crags and spin-drift seas was a niggard\nbeside this; here life covered the earth, filled the oceans, and made\nthe heavens clangerous around him. He wondered if the driving energy\nwithin man, the force which had raised him to the stars, made him\nhalf-god and half-demon, if that was a legacy of Terra.\n\nWell--man had changed; over the thousands of years, natural and\ncontrolled adaptation had fitted him to the worlds he had colonized, and\nmost of his many races could not now feel at home here. Jorun thought of\nhis own party: round, amber-skinned Chuli from a tropic world,\ncomplaining bitterly about the cold and dryness; gay young Cluthe,\ngangling and bulge-chested; sophisticated Taliuvenna of the flowing dark\nhair and the lustrous eyes--no, to them Earth was only one more planet,\nout of thousands they had seen in their long lives.\n\n_And I'm a sentimental fool._\n\n\n2\n\nHe could have willed the vague regret out of his trained nervous system,\nbut he didn't want to. This was the last time human eyes would ever look\non Earth, and somehow Jorun felt that it should be more to him than just\nanother psychotechnic job.\n\n\"Hello, good sir.\"\n\nHe turned at the voice and forced his tired lips into a friendly smile.\n\"Hello, Julith,\" he said. It was a wise policy to learn the names of the\ntownspeople, at least, and she was a great-great-granddaughter of the\nSpeaker.\n\nShe was some thirteen or fourteen years old, a freckle-faced child with\na shy smile, and steady green eyes. There was a certain awkward grace\nabout her, and she seemed more imaginative than most of her stolid race.\nShe curtsied quaintly for him, her bare foot reaching out under the long\nsmock which was daily female dress here.\n\n\"Are you busy, good sir?\" she asked.\n\n\"Well, not too much,\" said Jorun. He was glad of a chance to talk; it\nsilenced his thoughts. \"What can I do for you?\"\n\n\"I wondered--\" She hesitated, then, breathlessly: \"I wonder if you could\ngive me a lift down to the beach? Only for an hour or two. It's too far\nto walk there before I have to be home, and I can't borrow a car, or\neven a horse. If it won't be any trouble, sir.\"\n\n\"Mmmm--shouldn't you be at home now? Isn't there milking and so on to\ndo?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't live on a farm, good sir. My father is a baker.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, so he is. I should have remembered.\" Jorun considered for an\ninstant. There was enough to do in town, and it wasn't fair for him to\nplay hooky while Zarek worked alone. \"Why do you want to go to the\nbeach, Julith?\"\n\n\"We'll be busy packing up,\" she said. \"Starting tomorrow, I guess. This\nis my last chance to see it.\"\n\nJorun's mouth twisted a little. \"All right,\" he said; \"I'll take you.\"\n\n\"You are very kind, good sir,\" she said gravely.\n\nHe didn't reply, but held out his arm, and she clasped it with one hand\nwhile her other arm gripped his waist. The generator inside his skull\nresponded to his will, reaching out and clawing itself to the fabric of\nforces and energies which was physical space. They rose quietly, and\nwent so slowly seaward that he didn't have to raise a wind-screen.\n\n\"Will we be able to fly like this when we get to the stars?\" she asked.\n\n\"I'm afraid not, Julith,\" he said. \"You see, the people of my\ncivilization are born this way. Thousands of years ago, men learned how\nto control the great basic forces of the cosmos with only a small bit of\nenergy. Finally they used artificial mutation--that is, they changed\nthemselves, slowly, over many generations, until their brains grew a new\npart that could generate this controlling force. We can now even, fly\nbetween the stars, by this power. But your people don't have that brain,\nso we had to build spaceships to take you away.\"\n\n\"I see,\" she said.\n\n\"Your great-great-great-grandchildren can be like us, if your people\nwant to be changed thus,\" he said.\n\n\"They didn't want to change before,\" she answered. \"I don't think\nthey'll do it now, even in their new home.\" Her voice held no\nbitterness; it was an acceptance.\n\nPrivately, Jorun doubted it. The psychic shock of this uprooting would\nbe bound to destroy the old traditions of the Terrans; it would not take\nmany centuries before they were culturally assimilated by Galactic\ncivilization.\n\nAssimilated--nice euphemism. Why not just say--eaten?\n\n\n\nThey landed on the beach. It was broad and white, running in dunes from\nthe thin, harsh, salt-streaked grass to the roar and tumble of surf. The\nsun was low over the watery horizon, filling the damp, blowing air with\ngold. Jorun could almost look directly at its huge disc.\n\nHe sat down. The sand gritted tinily under him, and the wind rumpled his\nhair and filled his nostrils with its sharp wet smell. He picked up a\nconch and turned it over in his fingers, wondering at the intricate\narchitecture of it.\n\n\"If you hold it to your ear,\" said Julith, \"you can hear the sea.\" Her\nchildish voice was curiously tender around the rough syllables of\nEarth's language.\n\nHe nodded and obeyed her hint. It was only the small pulse of blood\nwithin him--you heard the same thing out in the great hollow silence of\nspace--but it did sing of restless immensities, wind and foam, and the\nlong waves marching under the moon.\n\n\"I have two of them myself,\" said Julith. \"I want them so I can always\nremember this beach. And my children and their children will hold them,\ntoo, and hear our sea talking.\" She folded his fingers around the shell.\n\"You keep this one for yourself.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said. \"I will.\" The combers rolled in, booming and\nspouting against the land. The Terrans called them the horses of God. A\nthin cloud in the west was turning rose and gold.\n\n\"Are there oceans on our new planet?\" asked Julith.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"It's the most Earth-like world we could find that\nwasn't already inhabited. You'll be happy there.\"\n\n_But the trees and grasses, the soil and the fruits thereof, the beasts\nof the field and the birds of the air and the fish of the waters\nbeneath, form and color, smell and sound, taste and texture, everything\nis different. Is alien. The difference is small, subtle, but it is the\nabyss of two billion years of separate evolution, and no other world can\never quite be Earth._\n\nJulith looked straight at him with solemn eyes. \"Are you folk afraid of\nHulduvians?\" she asked.\n\n\"Why, no,\" he said. \"Of course not.\"\n\n\"Then why are you giving Earth to them?\" It was a soft question, but it\ntrembled just a little.\n\n\"I thought all your people understood the reason by now,\" said Jorun.\n\"Civilization--the civilization of man and his nonhuman allies--has\nmoved inward, toward the great star-clusters of Galactic center. This\npart of space means nothing to us any more; it's almost a desert. You\nhaven't seen starlight till you've been by Sagittarius. Now the\nHulduvians are another civilization. They are not the least bit like us;\nthey live on big, poisonous worlds like Jupiter and Saturn. I think they\nwould seem like pretty nice monsters if they weren't so alien to us that\nneither side can really understand the other. They use the cosmic\nenergies too, but in a different way--and their way interferes with ours\njust as ours interferes with theirs. Different brains, you see.\n\n\"Anyway, it was decided that the two civilizations would get along best\nby just staying away from each other. If they divided up the Galaxy\nbetween them, there would be no interference; it would be too far from\none civilization to the other. The Hulduvians were, really, very nice\nabout it. They're willing to take the outer rim, even if there are fewer\nstars, and let us have the center.\n\n\"So by the agreement, we've got to have all men and manlike beings out\nof their territory before they come to settle it, just as they'll move\nout of ours. Their colonists won't be coming to Jupiter and Saturn for\ncenturies yet; but even so, we have to clear the Sirius Sector now,\nbecause there'll be a lot of work to do elsewhere. Fortunately, there\nare only a few people living in this whole part of space. The Sirius\nSector has been an isolated, primi--ah--quiet region since the First\nEmpire fell, fifty thousand years ago.\"\n\nJulith's voice rose a little. \"But those people are _us_!\"\n\n\"And the folk of Alpha Centauri and Procyon and Sirius and--oh, hundreds\nof other stars. Yet all of you together are only one tiny drop in the\nquadrillions of the Galaxy. Don't you see, Julith, you have to move for\nthe good of all of us?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"Yes, I know all that.\"\n\nShe got up, shaking herself. \"Let's go swimming.\"\n\nJorun smiled and shook his head. \"No, I'll wait for you if you want to\ngo.\"\n\n\n\nShe nodded and ran off down the beach, sheltering behind a dune to put\non a bathing-suit. The Terrans had a nudity taboo, in spite of the mild\ninterglacial climate; typical primitive irrationality. Jorun lay back,\nfolding his arms behind his head, and looked up at the darkening sky.\nThe evening star twinkled forth, low and white on the dusk-blue horizon.\nVenus--or was it Mercury? He wasn't sure. He wished he knew more about\nthe early history of the Solar System, the first men to ride their\nthunderous rockets out to die on unknown hell-worlds--the first clumsy\nsteps toward the stars. He could look it up in the archives of Corazuno,\nbut he knew he never would. Too much else to do, too much to remember.\nProbably less than one percent of mankind's throngs even knew where\nEarth was, today--though, for a while, it had been quite a\ntourist-center. But that was perhaps thirty thousand years ago.\n\n_Because this world, out of all the billions, has certain physical\ncharacteristics_, he thought, _my race has made them into standards. Our\nbasic units of length and time and acceleration, our comparisons by\nwhich we classify the swarming planets of the Galaxy, they all go back\nultimately to Earth. We bear that unspoken memorial to our birthplace\nwithin our whole civilization, and will bear it forever. But has she\ngiven us more than that? Are our own selves, bodies and minds and\ndreams, are they also the children of Earth?_\n\nNow he was thinking like Kormt, stubborn old Kormt who clung with such a\nblind strength to this land simply because it was his. When you\nconsidered all the races of this wander-footed species--how many of them\nthere were, how many kinds of man between the stars! And yet they all\nwalked upright; they all had two eyes and a nose between and a mouth\nbelow; they were all cells of that great and ancient culture which had\nbegun here, eons past, with the first hairy half-man who kindled a fire\nagainst night. If Earth had not had darkness and cold and prowling\nbeasts, oxygen and cellulose and flint, that culture might never have\ngestated.\n\n_I'm getting unlogical. Too tired, nerves worn too thin, psychosomatic\ncontrol slipping. Now Earth is becoming some obscure mother-symbol for\nme._\n\n_Or has she always been one, for the whole race of us?_\n\nA seagull cried harshly overhead and soared from view.\n\nThe sunset was smoldering away and dusk rose like fog out of the ground.\nJulith came running back to him, her face indistinct in the gloom. She\nwas breathing hard, and he couldn't tell if the catch in her voice was\nlaughter or weeping.\n\n\"I'd better be getting home,\" she said.\n\n\n3\n\nThey flew slowly back. The town was a yellow twinkle of lights, warmth\ngleaming from windows across many empty kilometers. Jorun set the girl\ndown outside her home.\n\n\"Thank you, good sir,\" she said, curtseying. \"Won't you come in to\ndinner?\"\n\n\"Well--\"\n\nThe door opened, etching the girl black against the ruddiness inside.\nJorun's luminous tunic made him like a torch in the dark. \"Why, it's the\nstar-man,\" said a woman's voice.\n\n\"I took your daughter for a swim,\" he explained. \"I hope you don't\nmind.\"\n\n\"And if we did, what would it matter?\" grumbled a bass tone. Jorun\nrecognized Kormt; the old man must have come as a guest from his farm on\nthe outskirts. \"What could we do about it?\"\n\n\"Now, Granther, that's no way to talk to the gentleman,\" said the woman.\n\"He's been very kind. Won't you come eat with us, good sir?\"\n\nJorun refused twice, in case they were only being polite, then accepted\ngladly enough. He was tired of cookery at the inn where he and Zarek\nboarded. \"Thank you.\"\n\nHe entered, ducking under the low door. A single long, smoky-raftered\nroom was kitchen, diningroom, and parlor; doors led off to the sleeping\nquarters. It was furnished with a clumsy elegance, skin rugs, oak\nwainscoting, carved pillars, glowing ornaments of hammered copper. A\nradium clock, which must be incredibly old, stood on the stone mantel,\nabove a snapping fire; a chemical-powered gun, obviously of local\nmanufacture, hung over it. Julith's parents, a plain, quiet peasant\ncouple, conducted him to the end of the wooden table, while half a dozen\nchildren watched him with large eyes. The younger children were the only\nTerrans who seemed to find this removal an adventure.\n\nThe meal was good and plentiful: meat, vegetables, bread, beer, milk,\nice cream, coffee, all of it from the farms hereabouts. There wasn't\nmuch trade between the few thousand communities of Earth; they were\npractically self-sufficient. The company ate in silence, as was the\ncustom here. When they were finished, Jorun wanted to go, but it would\nhave been rude to leave immediately. He went over to a chair by the\nfireplace, across from the one in which Kormt sprawled.\n\nThe old man took out a big-bowled pipe and began stuffing it. Shadows\nwove across his seamed brown face, his eyes were a gleam out of\ndarkness. \"I'll go down to City Hall with you soon,\" he said; \"I imagine\nthat's where the work is going on.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jorun, \"I can relieve Zarek at it. I'd appreciate it if you\ndid come, good sir. Your influence is very steadying on these people.\"\n\n\"It should be,\" said Kormt. \"I've been their Speaker for almost a\nhundred years. And my father Gerlaug was before me, and his father Kormt\nwas before him.\" He took a brand from the fire and held it over his\npipe, puffing hard, looking up at Jorun through tangled brows. \"Who was\nyour great-grandfather?\"\n\n\"Why--I don't know. I imagine he's still alive somewhere, but--\"\n\n\"I thought so. No marriage. No family. No home. No tradition.\" Kormt\nshook, his massive head, slowly, \"I pity you Galactics!\"\n\n\"Now please, good sir--\" Damn it all, the old clodhopper could get as\nirritating as a faulty computer. \"We have records that go back to before\nman left this planet. Records of everything. It is you who have\nforgotten.\"\n\nKormt smiled and puffed blue clouds at him. \"That's not what I meant.\"\n\n\"Do you mean you think it is good for men to live a life that is\nunchanging, that is just the same from century to century--no new\ndreams, no new triumphs, always the same grubbing rounds of days? I\ncannot agree.\"\n\n\n\nJorun's mind flickered over history, trying to evaluate the basic\nmotivations of his opponent. Partly cultural, partly biological, that\nmust be it. Once Terra had been the center of the civilized universe.\nBut the long migration starward, especially after the fall of the First\nEmpire, drained off the most venturesome elements of the population.\nThat drain went on for thousands of years. Sol was backward, ruined and\nimpoverished by the remorseless price of empire, helpless before the\nstorms of barbarian conquest that swept back and forth between the\nstars. Even after peace was restored, there was nothing to hold a young\nman or woman of vitality and imagination here--not when you could go\ntoward Galactic center and join the new civilization building out there.\nSpace-traffic came ever less frequently to Sol; old machines rusted away\nand were not replaced; best to get out while there was still time.\n\nEventually there was a fixed psychosomatic type, one which lived close\nto the land, in primitive changeless communities and isolated\nfarmsteads--a type content to gain its simple needs by the labor of\nhand, horse, or an occasional battered engine. A culture grew up which\nincreased that rigidity. So few had visited Earth in the last several\nthousand years--perhaps one outsider a century, stopping briefly off on\nhis way to somewhere else--that there was no challenge or encouragement\nto alter. The Terrans didn't _want_ more people, more machines, more\nanything; they wished only to remain as they were.\n\nYou couldn't call them stagnant. Their life was too healthy, their\ncivilization too rich in its own way--folk art, folk music, ceremony,\nreligion, the intimacy of family life which the Galactics had lost--for\nthat term. But to one who flew between the streaming suns, it was a\nsmall existence.\n\nKormt's voice broke in on his reverie. \"Dreams, triumphs, work, deeds,\nlove and life and finally death and the long sleep in the earth,\" he\nsaid. \"Why should we want to change them? They never grow old; they are\nnew for each child that is born.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Jorun, and stopped. You couldn't really answer that kind of\nlogic. It wasn't logic at all, but something deeper.\n\n\"Well,\" he started over, after a while, \"as you know, this evacuation\nwas forced on us, too. We don't want to move you, but we must.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Kormt. \"You have been very nice about it. It would have\nbeen easier, in a way, if you'd come with fire and gun and chains for\nus, like the barbarians did long ago. We could have understood you\nbetter then.\"\n\n\"At best, it will be hard for your people,\" said Jorun. \"It will be a\nshock, and they'll need leaders to guide them through it. You have a\nduty to help them out there, good sir.\"\n\n\"Maybe.\" Kormt blew a series of smoke rings at his youngest descendant,\nthree years old, who crowed with laughter and climbed up on his knee.\n\"But they'll manage.\"\n\n\"You can't seem to realize,\" said Jorun, \"that you are the _last man on\nEarth_ who refuses to go. You will be _alone_. For the rest of your\nlife! We couldn't come back for you later under any circumstances,\nbecause there'll be Hulduvian colonies between Sol and Sagittarius which\nwe would disturb in passage. You'll be alone, I say!\"\n\nKormt shrugged. \"I'm too old to change my ways; there can't be many\nyears left me, anyway. I can live well, just off the food-stores that'll\nbe left here.\" He ruffled the child's hair, but his face drew into a\nscowl. \"Now, no more of that, good sir, if you please; I'm tired of this\nargument.\"\n\n\n\nJorun nodded and fell into the silence that held the rest. Terrans would\nsometimes sit for hours without talking, content to be in each other's\nnearness. He thought of Kormt, Gerlaug's son, last man on Earth,\naltogether alone, living alone and dying alone; and yet, he reflected,\nwas that solitude any greater than the one in which all men dwelt all\ntheir days?\n\nPresently the Speaker set the child down, knocked out his pipe, and\nrose. \"Come, good sir,\" he said, reaching for his staff. \"Let us go.\"\n\nThey walked side by side down the street, under the dim lamps and past\nthe yellow windows. The cobbles gave back their footfalls in a dull\nclatter. Once in a while they passed someone else, a vague figure which\nbowed to Kormt. Only one did not notice them, an old woman who walked\ncrying between the high walls.\n\n\"They say it is never night on your worlds,\" said Kormt.\n\nJorun threw him a sidelong glance. His face was a strong jutting of\nhighlights from sliding shadow. \"Some planets have been given luminous\nskies,\" said the technician, \"and a few still have cities, too, where it\nis always light. But when every man can control the cosmic energies,\nthere is no real reason for us to live together; most of us dwell far\napart. There are very dark nights on my own world, and I cannot see any\nother home from my own--just the moors.\"\n\n\"It must be a strange life,\" said Kormt. \"Belonging to no one.\"\n\nThey came out on the market-square, a broad paved space walled in by\nhouses. There was a fountain in its middle, and a statue dug out of the\nruins had been placed there. It was broken, one arm gone--but still the\nwhite slim figure of the dancing girl stood with youth and laughter,\nforever under the sky of Earth. Jorun knew that lovers were wont to meet\nhere, and briefly, irrationally, he wondered how lonely the girl would\nbe in all the millions of years to come.\n\nThe City Hall lay at the farther end of the square, big and dark, its\neaves carved with dragons, and the gables topped with wing-spreading\nbirds. It was an old building; nobody knew how many generations of men\nhad gathered here. A long, patient line of folk stood outside it,\nshuffling in one by one to the registry desk; emerging, they went off\nquietly into the darkness, toward the temporary shelters erected for\nthem.\n\nWalking by the line, Jorun picked faces out of the shadows. There was a\nyoung mother holding a crying child, her head bent over it in a timeless\npose, murmuring to soothe it. There was a mechanic, still sooty from his\nwork, smiling wearily at some tired joke of the man behind him. There\nwas a scowling, black-browed peasant who muttered a curse as Jorun went\nby; the rest seemed to accept their fate meekly enough. There was a\npriest, his head bowed, alone with his God. There was a younger man, his\nhands clenching and unclenching, big helpless hands, and Jorun heard him\nsaying to someone else: \"--if they could have waited till after harvest.\nI hate to let good grain stand in the field.\"\n\n\n\nJorun went into the main room, toward the desk at the head of the line.\nHulking hairless Zarek was patiently questioning each of the hundreds\nwho came hat in hand before him: name, age, sex, occupation, dependents,\nspecial needs or desires. He punches the answers out on the recorder\nmachine, half a million lives were held in its electronic memory.\n\n\"Oh, there you are,\" his bass rumbled. \"Where've you been?\"\n\n\"I had to do some concy work,\" said Jorun. That was a private code term,\namong others: concy, conciliation, anything to make the evacuation go\nsmoothly. \"Sorry to be so late. I'll take over now.\"\n\n\"All right. I think we can wind the whole thing up by midnight.\" Zarek\nsmiled at Kormt. \"Glad you came, good sir. There are a few people I'd\nlike you to talk to.\" He gestured at half a dozen seated in the rear of\nthe room. Certain complaints were best handled by native leaders.\n\nKormt nodded and strode over to the folk. Jorun heard a man begin some\nlong-winded explanation: he wanted to take his own plow along, he'd made\nit himself and there was no better plow in the universe, but the\nstar-man said there wouldn't be room.\n\n\"They'll furnish us with all the stuff we need, son,\" said Kormt.\n\n\"But it's _my_ plow!\" said the man. His fingers twisted his cap.\n\nKormt sat down and began soothing him.\n\nThe head of the line waited a few meters off while Jorun took Zarek's\nplace. \"Been a long grind,\" said the latter. \"About done now, though.\nAnd will I be glad to see the last of this planet!\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Jorun. \"It's a lovely world. I don't think I've\never seen a more beautiful one.\"\n\nZarek snorted. \"Me for Thonnvar! I can't wait to sit on the terrace by\nthe Scarlet Sea, fern-trees and red grass all around, a glass of oehl in\nmy hand and the crystal geysers in front of me. You're a funny one,\nJorun.\"\n\nThe Fulkhisian shrugged slender shoulders. Zarek clapped him on the back\nand went out for supper and sleep. Jorun beckoned to the next Terran and\nsettled down to the long, almost mindless routine of registration. He\nwas interrupted once by Kormt, who yawned mightily and bade him\ngoodnight; otherwise it was a steady, half-conscious interval in which\none anonymous face after another passed by. He was dimly surprised when\nthe last one came up. This was a plump, cheerful, middle-aged fellow\nwith small shrewd eyes, a little more colorfully dressed than the\nothers. He gave his occupation as merchant--a minor tradesman, he\nexplained, dealing in the little things it was more convenient for the\npeasants to buy than to manufacture themselves.\n\n\"I hope you haven't been waiting too long,\" said Jorun. Concy statement.\n\n\"Oh, no.\" The merchant grinned. \"I knew those dumb farmers would be here\nfor hours, so I just went to bed and got up half an hour ago, when it\nwas about over.\"\n\n\"Clever.\" Jorun rose, sighed, and stretched. The big room was\ncavernously empty, its lights a harsh glare. It was very quiet here.\n\n\"Well, sir, I'm a middling smart chap, if I say it as shouldn't. And you\nknow, I'd like to express my appreciation of all you're doing for us.\"\n\n\"Can't say we're doing much.\" Jorun locked the machine.\n\n\"Oh, the apple-knockers may not like it, but really, good sir, this\nhasn't been any place for a man of enterprise. It's dead. I'd have got\nout long ago if there'd been any transportation. Now, when we're getting\nback into civilization, there'll be some real opportunities. I'll make\nmy pile inside of five years, you bet.\"\n\nJorun smiled, but there was a bleakness in him. What chance would this\nbarbarian have even to get near the gigantic work of civilization--let\nalone comprehend it or take part in it. He hoped the little fellow\nwouldn't break his heart trying.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"goodnight, and good luck to you.\"\n\n\"Goodnight, sir. We'll meet again, I trust.\"\n\nJorun switched off the lights and went out into the square. It was\ncompletely deserted. The moon was up now, almost full, and its cold\nradiance dimmed the lamps. He heard a dog howling far off. The dogs of\nEarth--such as weren't taken along--would be lonely, too.\n\n_Well_, he thought, _the job's over. Tomorrow, or the next day, the\nships come._\n\n\n4\n\nHe felt very tired, but didn't want to sleep, and willed himself back to\nalertness. There hadn't been much chance to inspect the ruins, and he\nfelt it would be appropriate to see them by moonlight.\n\nRising into the air, he ghosted above roofs and trees until he came to\nthe dead city. For a while he hovered in a sky like dark velvet, a\nfaint breeze murmured around him, and he heard the remote noise of\ncrickets and the sea. But stillness enveloped it all, there was no real\nsound.\n\nSol City, capital of the legendary First Empire, had been enormous. It\nmust have sprawled over forty or fifty thousand square kilometers when\nit was in its prime, when it was the gay and wicked heart of human\ncivilization and swollen with the lifeblood of the stars. And yet those\nwho built it had been men of taste, they had sought out genius to create\nfor them. The city was not a collection of buildings; it was a balanced\nwhole, radiating from the mighty peaks of the central palace, through\ncolonnades and parks and leaping skyways, out to the temple-like villas\nof the rulers. For all its monstrous size, it had been a fairy sight, a\nwoven lace of polished metal and white, black, red stone, colored\nplastic, music and light--everywhere light.\n\nBombarded from space; sacked again and again by the barbarian hordes who\nswarmed maggot-like through the bones of the slain Empire; weathered,\nshaken by the slow sliding of Earth's crust; pried apart by patient,\ndelicate roots; dug over by hundreds of generations of archaeologists,\ntreasure-seekers, the idly curious; made a quarry of metal and stone for\nthe ignorant peasants who finally huddled about it--still its empty\nwalls and blind windows, crumbling arches and toppled pillars held a\nghost of beauty and magnificence which was like a half-remembered dream.\nA dream the whole race had once had.\n\n_And now we're waking up._\n\nJorun moved silently over the ruins. Trees growing between tumbled\nblocks dappled them with moonlight and shadow; the marble was very white\nand fair against darkness. He hovered by a broken caryatid, marveling at\nits exquisite leaping litheness; that girl had borne tons of stone like\na flower in her hair. Further on, across a street that was a lane of\nwoods, beyond a park that was thick with forest, lay the nearly complete\noutline of a house. Only its rain-blurred walls stood, but he could\ntrace the separate rooms: here a noble had entertained his friends,\nrobes that were fluid rainbows, jewels dripping fire, swift cynical\ninterplay of wits like sharpened swords rising above music and the clear\nsweet laughter of dancing-girls; here people whose flesh was now dust\nhad slept and made love and lain side-by-side in darkness to watch the\nmoving pageant of the city; here the slaves had lived and worked and\nsometimes wept; here the children had played their ageless games under\nwillows, between banks of roses. Oh, it had been a hard and cruel time;\nit was well gone but it had lived. It had embodied man, all that was\nnoble and splendid and evil and merely wistful in the race, and now its\nlate children had forgotten.\n\nA cat sprang up on one of the walls and flowed noiselessly along it,\nhunting. Jorun shook himself and flew toward the center of the city, the\nimperial palace. An owl hooted somewhere, and a bat fluttered out of his\nway like a small damned soul blackened by hellfire. He didn't raise a\nwind-screen, but let the air blow around him, the air of Earth.\n\n\n\nThe palace was almost completely wrecked, a mountain of heaped rocks,\nbare bones of \"eternal\" metal gnawed thin by steady ages of wind and\nrain and frost, but once it must have been gigantic. Men rarely built\nthat big nowadays, they didn't need to; and the whole human spirit had\nchanged, become ever more abstract, finding its treasures within itself.\nBut there had been an elemental magnificence about early man and the\nworks he raised to challenge the sky.\n\nOne tower still stood--a gutted shell, white under the stars, rising in\na filigree of columns and arches which seemed impossibly airy, as if it\nwere built of moonlight. Jorun settled on its broken upper balcony,\ndizzily high above the black-and-white fantasy of the ruins. A hawk flew\nshrieking from its nest, then there was silence.\n\nNo--wait--another yell, ringing down the star ways, a dark streak across\nthe moon's face. \"Hai-ah!\" Jorun recognized the joyful shout of young\nCluthe, rushing through heaven like a demon on a broomstick, and scowled\nin annoyance. He didn't want to be bothered now.\n\nWell, they had as much right here as he. He repressed the emotion, and\neven managed a smile. After all, he would have liked to feel gay and\nreckless at times, but he had never been able to. Jorun was little older\nthan Cluthe--a few centuries at most--but he came of a melancholy folk;\nhe had been born old.\n\nAnother form pursued the first. As they neared, Jorun recognized\nTaliuvenna's supple outline. Those two had been teamed up for one of the\nAfrican districts, but--\n\nThey sensed him and came wildly out of the sky to perch on the balcony\nrailing and swing their legs above the heights. \"How're you?\" asked\nCluthe. His lean face laughed in the moonlight. \"Whoo-oo, what a\nflight!\"\n\n\"I'm all right,\" said Jorun. \"You through in your sector?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. So we thought we'd just duck over and look in here. Last chance\nanyone'll ever have to do some sight-seeing on Earth.\"\n\nTaliuvenna's full lips drooped a bit as she looked over the ruins. She\ncame from Yunith, one of the few planets where they still kept cities,\nand was as much a child of their soaring arrogance as Jorun of his hills\nand tundras and great empty seas. \"I thought it would be bigger,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"Well, they were building this fifty or sixty thousand years ago,\" said\nCluthe. \"Can't expect too much.\"\n\n\"There is good art left here,\" said Jorun. \"Pieces which for one reason\nor another weren't carried off. But you have to look around for it.\"\n\n\"I've seen a lot of it already, in museums,\" said Taliuvenna. \"Not bad.\"\n\n\"C'mon, Tally,\" cried Cluthe. He touched her shoulder and sprang into\nthe air. \"Tag! You're it!\"\n\nShe screamed with laughter and shot off after him. They rushed across\nthe wilderness, weaving in and out of empty windows and broken\ncolonnades, and their shouts woke a clamor of echoes.\n\nJorun sighed. _I'd better go to bed_, he thought. _It's late._\n\n\n\nThe spaceship was a steely pillar against a low gray sky. Now and then a\nfine rain would drizzle down, blurring it from sight; then that would\nend, and the ship's flanks would glisten as if they were polished.\nClouds scudded overhead like flying smoke, and the wind was loud in the\ntrees.\n\nThe line of Terrans moving slowly into the vessel seemed to go on\nforever. A couple of the ship's crew flew above them, throwing out a\nshield against the rain. They shuffled without much talk or expression,\npushing carts filled with their little possessions. Jorun stood to one\nside, watching them go by, one face after another--scored and darkened\nby the sun of Earth, the winds of Earth, hands still grimy with the soil\nof Earth.\n\n_Well_, he thought, _there they go. They aren't being as emotional about\nit as I thought they would. I wonder if they really do care._\n\nJulith went past with her parents. She saw him and darted from the line\nand curtsied before him.\n\n\"Goodbye, good sir,\" she said. Looking up, she showed him a small and\nserious face. \"Will I ever see you again?\"\n\n\"Well,\" he lied, \"I might look in on you sometime.\"\n\n\"Please do! In a few years, maybe, when you can.\"\n\n_It takes many generations to raise a people like this to our standard.\nIn a few years--to me--she'll be in her grave._\n\n\"I'm sure you'll be very happy,\" he said.\n\nShe gulped. \"Yes,\" she said, so low he could barely hear her. \"Yes, I\nknow I will.\" She turned and ran back to her mother. The raindrops\nglistened in her hair.\n\nZarek came up behind Jorun. \"I made a last-minute sweep of the whole\narea,\" he said. \"Detected no sign of human life. So it's all taken care\nof, except your old man.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Jorun tonelessly.\n\n\"I wish you could do something about him.\"\n\n\"So do I.\"\n\nZarek strolled off again.\n\nA young man and woman, walking hand in hand, turned out of the line not\nfar away and stood for a little while. A spaceman zoomed over to them.\n\"Better get back,\" he warned. \"You'll get rained on.\"\n\n\"That's what we wanted,\" said the young man.\n\nThe spaceman shrugged and resumed his hovering. Presently the couple\nre-entered the line.\n\nThe tail of the procession went by Jorun and the ship swallowed it fast.\nThe rain fell harder, bouncing off his force-shield like silver spears.\nLightning winked in the west, and he heard the distant exuberance of\nthunder.\n\nKormt came walking slowly toward him. Rain streamed off his clothes and\nmatted his long gray hair and beard. His wooden shoes made a wet sound\nin the mud. Jorun extended the force-shield to cover him. \"I hope you've\nchanged your mind,\" said the Fulkhisian.\n\n\"No, I haven't,\" said Kormt. \"I just stayed away till everybody was\naboard. Don't like goodbyes.\"\n\n\"You don't know what you're doing,\" said Jorun for\nthe--thousandth?--time. \"It's plain madness to stay here alone.\"\n\n\"I told you I don't like goodbyes,\" said Kormt harshly.\n\n\"I have to go advise the captain of the ship,\" said Jorun. \"You have\nmaybe half an hour before she lifts. Nobody will laugh at you for\nchanging your mind.\"\n\n\"I won't.\" Kormt smiled without warmth. \"You people are the future, I\nguess. Why can't you leave the past alone? I'm the past.\" He looked\ntoward the far hills, hidden by the noisy rain. \"I like it here,\nGalactic. That should be enough for you.\"\n\n\"Well, then--\" Jorun held out his hand in the archaic gesture of Earth.\n\"Goodbye.\"\n\n\"Goodbye.\" Kormt took the hand with a brief, indifferent clasp. Then he\nturned and walked off toward the village. Jorun watched him till he was\nout of sight.\n\nThe technician paused in the air-lock door, looking over the gray\nlandscape and the village from whose chimneys no smoke rose. _Farewell,\nmy mother_, he thought. And then, surprising himself: _Maybe Kormt is\ndoing the right thing after all._\n\nHe entered the ship and the door closed behind him.\n\n\n\nToward evening, the clouds lifted and the sky showed a clear pale\nblue--as if it had been washed clean--and the grass and leaves\nglistened. Kormt came out of the house to watch the sunset. It was a\ngood one, all flame and gold. A pity little Julith wasn't here to see\nit; she'd always liked sunsets. But Julith was so far away now that if\nshe sent a call to him, calling with the speed of light, it would not\ncome before he was dead.\n\nNothing would come to him. Not ever again.\n\nHe tamped his pipe with a horny thumb and lit it and drew a deep cloud\ninto his lungs. Hands in pockets, he strolled down the wet streets. The\nsound of his clogs was unexpectedly loud.\n\n_Well, son_, he thought, _now you've got a whole world all to yourself,\nto do with just as you like. You're the richest man who ever lived._\n\nThere was no problem in keeping alive. Enough food of all kinds was\nstored in the town's freeze-vault to support a hundred men for the ten\nor twenty years remaining to him. But he'd want to stay busy. He could\nmaybe keep three farms from going to seed--watch over fields and\norchards and livestock, repair the buildings, dust and wash and light up\nin the evening. A man ought to keep busy.\n\nHe came to the end of the street, where it turned into a graveled road\nwinding up toward a high hill, and followed that. Dusk was creeping over\nthe fields, the sea was a metal streak very far away and a few early\nstars blinked forth. A wind was springing up, a soft murmurous wind that\ntalked in the trees. But how quiet things were!\n\nOn top of the hill stood the chapel, a small steepled building\nof ancient stone. He let himself in the gate and walked around\nto the graveyard behind. There were many of the demure white\ntombstones--thousands of years of Solis Township men and women who had\nlived and worked and begotten, laughed and wept and died. Someone had\nput a wreath on one grave only this morning; it brushed against his leg\nas he went by. Tomorrow it would be withered, and weeds would start to\ngrow. He'd have to tend the chapel yard, too. Only fitting.\n\nHe found his family plot and stood with feet spread apart, fists on\nhips, smoking and looking down at the markers Gerlaug Kormt's son, Tarna\nHuwan's daughter, these hundred years had they lain in the earth. Hello,\nDad, hello, Mother. His fingers reached out and stroked the headstone of\nhis wife. And so many of his children were here, too; sometimes he found\nit hard to believe that tall Gerlaug and laughing Stamm and shy, gentle\nHuwan were gone. He'd outlived too many people.\n\n_I had to stay_, he thought. _This is my land, I am of it and I couldn't\ngo. Someone had to stay and keep the land, if only for a little while. I\ncan give it ten more years before the forest comes and takes it._\n\nDarkness grew around him. The woods beyond the hill loomed like a wall.\nOnce he started violently, he thought he heard a child crying. No, only\na bird. He cursed himself for the senseless pounding of his heart.\n\n_Gloomy place here_, he thought. _Better get back to the house._\n\nHe groped slowly out of the yard, toward the road. The stars were out\nnow. Kormt looked up and thought he had never seen them so bright. Too\nbright; he didn't like it.\n\n_Go away, stars_, he thought. _You took my people, but I'm staying here.\nThis is my land._ He reached down to touch it, but the grass was cold\nand wet under his palm.\n\nThe gravel scrunched loudly as he walked, and the wind mumbled in the\nhedges, but there was no other sound. Not a voice called; not an engine\nturned; not a dog barked. No, he hadn't thought it would be so quiet.\n\nAnd dark. No lights. Have to tend the street lamps himself--it was no\nfun, not being able to see the town from here, not being able to see\nanything except the stars. Should have remembered to bring a flashlight,\nbut he was old and absentminded, and there was no one to remind him.\nWhen he died, there would be no one to hold his hands; no one to close\nhis eyes and lay him in the earth--and the forests would grow in over\nthe land and wild beasts would nuzzle his bones.\n\n_But I knew that. What of it? I'm tough enough to take it._\n\nThe stars flashed and flashed above him. Looking up, against his own\nwill, Kormt saw how bright they were, how bright and quiet. And how very\nfar away! He was seeing light that had left its home before he was born.\n\nHe stopped, sucking in his breath between his teeth. \"No,\" he whispered.\n\nThis was his land. This was Earth, the home of man; it was his and he\nwas its. This was the _land_, and not a single dust-mote, crazily\nreeling and spinning through an endlessness of dark and silence, cold\nand immensity. Earth could not be so alone!\n\n_The last man alive. The last man in all the world!_\n\nHe screamed, then, and began to run. His feet clattered loud on the\nroad; the small sound was quickly swallowed by silence, and he covered\nhis face against the relentless blaze of the stars. But there was no\nplace to run to, no place at all.",
