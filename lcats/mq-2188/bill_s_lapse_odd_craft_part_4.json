    "body": "\nBILL'S LAPSE\n\nStrength and good-nature--said the night-watchman, musingly, as he felt\nhis biceps--strength and good-nature always go together.  Sometimes you\nfind a strong man who is not good-natured, but then, as everybody he\ncomes in contack with is, it comes to the same thing.\n\nThe strongest and kindest-'earted man I ever come across was a man o' the\nname of Bill Burton, a ship-mate of Ginger Dick's.  For that matter 'e\nwas a shipmate o' Peter Russet's and old Sam Small's too.  Not over and\nabove tall; just about my height, his arms was like another man's legs\nfor size, and 'is chest and his back and shoulders might ha' been made\nfor a giant.  And with all that he'd got a soft blue eye like a gal's\n(blue's my favourite colour for gals' eyes), and a nice, soft, curly\nbrown beard.  He was an A.B., too, and that showed 'ow good-natured he\nwas, to pick up with firemen.\n\nHe got so fond of 'em that when they was all paid off from the _Ocean\nKing_ he asked to be allowed to join them in taking a room ashore.  It\npleased every-body, four coming cheaper than three, and Bill being that\ngood-tempered that 'e'd put up with anything, and when any of the three\nquarrelled he used to act the part of peacemaker.\n\nThe only thing about 'im that they didn't like was that 'e was a\nteetotaler.  He'd go into public-'ouses with 'em, but he wouldn't drink;\nleastways, that is to say, he wouldn't drink beer, and Ginger used to say\nthat it made 'im feel uncomfortable to see Bill put away a bottle o'\nlemonade every time they 'ad a drink.  One night arter 'e had 'ad\nseventeen bottles he could 'ardly got home, and Peter Russet, who knew a\nlot about pills and such-like, pointed out to 'im 'ow bad it was for his\nconstitushon.  He proved that the lemonade would eat away the coats o'\nBill's stomach, and that if 'e kept on 'e might drop down dead at any\nmoment.\n\nThat frightened Bill a bit, and the next night, instead of 'aving\nlemonade, 'e had five bottles o' stone ginger-beer, six of different\nkinds of teetotal beer, three of soda-water, and two cups of coffee.  I'm\nnot counting the drink he 'ad at the chemist's shop arterward, because he\ntook that as medicine, but he was so queer in 'is inside next morning\nthat 'e began to be afraid he'd 'ave to give up drink altogether.\n\nHe went without the next night, but 'e was such a generous man that 'e\nwould pay every fourth time, and there was no pleasure to the other chaps\nto see 'im pay and 'ave nothing out of it.  It spoilt their evening, and\nowing to 'aving only about 'arf wot they was accustomed to they all got\nup very disagreeable next morning.\n\n\"Why not take just a little beer, Bill?\" asks Ginger.\n\nBill 'ung his 'ead and looked a bit silly.  \"I'd rather not, mate,\" he\nses, at last.  \"I've been teetotal for eleven months now.\"\n\n\"Think of your 'ealth, Bill,\" ses Peter Russet; \"your 'ealth is more\nimportant than the pledge.  Wot made you take it?\"\n\nBill coughed.  \"I 'ad reasons,\" he ses, slowly.  \"A mate o' mine wished\nme to.\"\n\n\"He ought to ha' known better,\" ses Sam.  \"He 'ad 'is reasons,\" ses Bill.\n\n\"Well, all I can say is, Bill,\" ses Ginger, \"all I can say is, it's very\ndisobligin' of you.\"\n\n\"Disobligin'?\" ses Bill, with a start; \"don't say that, mate.\"\n\n\"I must say it,\" ses Ginger, speaking very firm.\n\n\"You needn't take a lot, Bill,\" ses Sam; \"nobody wants you to do that.\nJust drink in moderation, same as wot we do.\"\n\n\"It gets into my 'ead,\" ses Bill, at last.\n\n\"Well, and wot of it?\" ses Ginger; \"it gets into everybody's 'ead\noccasionally.  Why, one night old Sam 'ere went up behind a policeman and\ntickled 'im under the arms; didn't you, Sam?\"\n\n\"I did nothing o' the kind,\" ses Sam, firing up.\n\n\"Well, you was fined ten bob for it next morning, that's all I know,\" ses\nGinger.\n\n\"I was fined ten bob for punching 'im,\" ses old Sam, very wild.  \"I never\ntickled a policeman in my life.  I never thought o' such a thing.  I'd no\nmore tickle a policeman than I'd fly.  Anybody that ses I did is a liar.\nWhy should I?  Where does the sense come in?  Wot should I want to do it\nfor?\"\n\n\"All right, Sam,\" ses Ginger, sticking 'is fingers in 'is ears, \"you\ndidn't, then.\"\n\n\"No, I didn't,\" ses Sam, \"and don't you forget it.  This ain't the fust\ntime you've told that lie about me.  I can take a joke with any man; but\nanybody that goes and ses I tickled--\"\n\n\"All right,\" ses Ginger and Peter Russet together.  \"You'll 'ave tickled\npoliceman on the brain if you ain't careful, Sam,\" ses Peter.\n\nOld Sam sat down growling, and Ginger Dick turned to Bill agin.  \"It gets\ninto everybody's 'ead at times,\" he ses, \"and where's the 'arm?  It's wot\nit was meant for.\"\n\nBill shook his 'ead, but when Ginger called 'im disobligin' agin he gave\nway and he broke the pledge that very evening with a pint o' six 'arf.\n\nGinger was surprised to see the way 'e took his liquor.  Arter three or\nfour pints he'd expected to see 'im turn a bit silly, or sing, or do\nsomething o' the kind, but Bill kept on as if 'e was drinking water.\n\n\"Think of the 'armless pleasure you've been losing all these months,\nBill,\" ses Ginger, smiling at him.\n\nBill said it wouldn't bear thinking of, and, the next place they came to\nhe said some rather 'ard things of the man who'd persuaded 'im to take\nthe pledge.  He 'ad two or three more there, and then they began to see\nthat it was beginning to have an effect on 'im.  The first one that\nnoticed it was Ginger Dick.  Bill 'ad just lit 'is pipe, and as he threw\nthe match down he ses: \"I don't like these 'ere safety matches,\" he ses.\n\n\"Don't you, Bill?\" ses Ginger.  \"I do, rather.\"\n\n\"Oh, you do, do you?\"  ses Bill, turning on 'im like lightning; \"well,\ntake that for contradictin',\" he ses, an' he gave Ginger a smack that\nnearly knocked his 'ead off.\n\nIt was so sudden that old Sam and Peter put their beer down and stared at\neach other as if they couldn't believe their eyes.  Then they stooped\ndown and helped pore Ginger on to 'is legs agin and began to brush 'im\ndown.\n\n\"Never mind about 'im, mates,\" ses Bill, looking at Ginger very wicked.\n\"P'r'aps he won't be so ready to give me 'is lip next time.  Let's come\nto another pub and enjoy ourselves.\"\n\nSam and Peter followed 'im out like lambs, 'ardly daring to look over\ntheir shoulder at Ginger, who was staggering arter them some distance\nbehind a 'olding a handerchief to 'is face.\n\n\"It's your turn to pay, Sam,\" ses Bill, when they'd got inside the next\nplace.  \"Wot's it to be?  Give it a name.\"\n\n\"Three 'arf pints o' four ale, miss,\" ses Sam, not because 'e was mean,\nbut because it wasn't 'is turn.  \"Three wot?\" ses Bill, turning on 'im.\n\n\"Three pots o' six ale, miss,\" ses Sam, in a hurry.\n\n\"That wasn't wot you said afore,\" ses Bill.  \"Take that,\" he ses, giving\npore old Sam a wipe in the mouth and knocking 'im over a stool; \"take\nthat for your sauce.\"\n\nPeter Russet stood staring at Sam and wondering wot Bill ud be like when\nhe'd 'ad a little more.  Sam picked hisself up arter a time and went\noutside to talk to Ginger about it, and then Bill put 'is arm round\nPeter's neck and began to cry a bit and say 'e was the only pal he'd got\nleft in the world.  It was very awkward for Peter, and more awkward still\nwhen the barman came up and told 'im to take Bill outside.\n\n\"Go on,\" he ses, \"out with 'im.\"\n\n\"He's all right,\" ses Peter, trembling; \"we's the truest-'arted gentleman\nin London.  Ain't you, Bill?\"\n\nBill said he was, and 'e asked the barman to go and hide 'is face because\nit reminded 'im of a little dog 'e had 'ad once wot 'ad died.\n\n\"You get outside afore you're hurt,\" ses the bar-man.\n\nBill punched at 'im over the bar, and not being able to reach 'im threw\nPeter's pot o' beer at 'im.  There was a fearful to-do then, and the\nlandlord jumped over the bar and stood in the doorway, whistling for the\npolice.  Bill struck out right and left, and the men in the bar went down\nlike skittles, Peter among them.  Then they got outside, and Bill, arter\ngiving the landlord a thump in the back wot nearly made him swallow the\nwhistle, jumped into a cab and pulled Peter Russet in arter 'im.\n\n\"I'll talk to you by-and-by,\" he ses, as the cab drove off at a gallop;\n\"there ain't room in this cab.  You wait, my lad, that's all.  You just\nwait till we get out, and I'll knock you silly.\"\n\n\"Wot for, Bill?\"  ses Peter, staring.\n\n\"Don't you talk to me,\" roars Bill.  \"If I choose to knock you about\nthat's my business, ain't it?  Besides, you know very well.\"\n\nHe wouldn't let Peter say another word, but coming to a quiet place near\nthe docks he stopped the cab and pulling 'im out gave 'im such a dressing\ndown that Peter thought 'is last hour 'ad arrived.  He let 'im go at\nlast, and after first making him pay the cab-man took 'im along till they\ncame to a public-'ouse and made 'im pay for drinks.\n\nThey stayed there till nearly eleven o'clock, and then Bill set off home\n'olding the unfortunit Peter by the scruff o' the neck, and wondering out\nloud whether 'e ought to pay 'im a bit more or not.  Afore 'e could make\nup 'is mind, however, he turned sleepy, and, throwing 'imself down on the\nbed which was meant for the two of 'em, fell into a peaceful sleep.\n\nSam and Ginger Dick came in a little while arterward, both badly marked\nwhere Bill 'ad hit them, and sat talking to Peter in whispers as to wot\nwas to be done.  Ginger, who 'ad plenty of pluck, was for them all to set\non to 'im, but Sam wouldn't 'ear of it, and as for Peter he was so sore\nhe could 'ardly move.\n\nThey all turned in to the other bed at last, 'arf afraid to move for fear\nof disturbing Bill, and when they woke up in the morning and see 'im\nsitting up in 'is bed they lay as still as mice.\n\n\"Why, Ginger, old chap,\" ses Bill, with a 'earty smile, \"wot are you all\nthree in one bed for?\"  \"We was a bit cold,\" ses Ginger.\n\n\"Cold?\"  ses Bill.  \"Wot, this weather?  We 'ad a bit of a spree last\nnight, old man, didn't we?  My throat's as dry as a cinder.\"\n\n\"It ain't my idea of a spree,\" ses Ginger, sitting up and looking at 'im.\n\n\"Good 'eavens, Ginger!\" ses Bill, starting back, \"wotever 'ave you been\na-doing to your face?  Have you been tumbling off of a 'bus?\"\n\nGinger couldn't answer; and Sam Small and Peter sat up in bed alongside\nof 'im, and Bill, getting as far back on 'is bed as he could, sat staring\nat their pore faces as if 'e was having a 'orrible dream.\n\n\"And there's Sam,\" he ses.  \"Where ever did you get that mouth, Sam?\"\n\n\"Same place as Ginger got 'is eye and pore Peter got 'is face,\" ses Sam,\ngrinding his teeth.\n\n\"You don't mean to tell me,\" ses Bill, in a sad voice--\"you don't mean to\ntell me that I did it?\"\n\n\"You know well enough,\" ses Ginger.\n\nBill looked at 'em, and 'is face got as long as a yard measure.\n\n\"I'd 'oped I'd growed out of it, mates,\" he ses, at last, \"but drink\nalways takes me like that.  I can't keep a pal.\"\n\n\"You surprise me,\" ses Ginger, sarcastic-like.  \"Don't talk like that,\nGinger,\" ses Bill, 'arf crying.\n\n\"It ain't my fault; it's my weakness.  Wot did I do it for?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" ses Ginger, \"but you won't get the chance of doing it\nagin, I'll tell you that much.\"\n\n\"I daresay I shall be better to-night, Ginger,\" ses Bill, very humble;\n\"it don't always take me that way.\n\n\"Well, we don't want you with us any more,\" ses old Sam, 'olding his 'ead\nvery high.\n\n\"You'll 'ave to go and get your beer by yourself, Bill,\" ses Peter\nRusset, feeling 'is bruises with the tips of 'is fingers.\n\n\"But then I should be worse,\" ses Bill.  \"I want cheerful company when\nI'm like that.  I should very likely come 'ome and 'arf kill you all in\nyour beds.  You don't 'arf know what I'm like.  Last night was nothing,\nelse I should 'ave remembered it.\"\n\n\"Cheerful company?\"  ses old Sam.  'Ow do you think company's going to be\ncheerful when you're carrying on like that, Bill?  Why don't you go away\nand leave us alone?\"\n\n\"Because I've got a 'art,\" ses Bill.  \"I can't chuck up pals in that\nfree-and-easy way.  Once I take a liking to anybody I'd do anything for\n'em, and I've never met three chaps I like better than wot I do you.\nThree nicer, straight-forrad, free-'anded mates I've never met afore.\"\n\n\"Why not take the pledge agin, Bill?\"  ses Peter Russet.\n\n\"No, mate,\" ses Bill, with a kind smile; \"it's just a weakness, and I\nmust try and grow out of it.  I'll tie a bit o' string round my little\nfinger to-night as a re-minder.\"\n\nHe got out of bed and began to wash 'is face, and Ginger Dick, who was\ndoing a bit o' thinking, gave a whisper to Sam and Peter Russet.\n\n\"All right, Bill, old man,\" he ses, getting out of bed and beginning to\nput his clothes on; \"but first of all we'll try and find out 'ow the\nlandlord is.\"\n\n\"Landlord?\" ses Bill, puffing and blowing in the basin.  \"Wot landlord?\"\n\n\"Why, the one you bashed,\" ses Ginger, with a wink at the other two.  \"He\n'adn't got 'is senses back when me and Sam came away.\"\n\nBill gave a groan and sat on the bed while 'e dried himself, and Ginger\ntold 'im 'ow he 'ad bent a quart pot on the landlord's 'ead, and 'ow the\nlandlord 'ad been carried upstairs and the doctor sent for.  He began to\ntremble all over, and when Ginger said he'd go out and see 'ow the land\nlay 'e could 'ardly thank 'im enough.\n\nHe stayed in the bedroom all day, with the blinds down, and wouldn't eat\nanything, and when Ginger looked in about eight o'clock to find out\nwhether he 'ad gone, he found 'im sitting on the bed clean shaved, and\n'is face cut about all over where the razor 'ad slipped.\n\nGinger was gone about two hours, and when 'e came back he looked so\nsolemn that old Sam asked 'im whether he 'ad seen a ghost.  Ginger didn't\nanswer 'im; he set down on the side o' the bed and sat thinking.\n\n\"I s'pose--I s'pose it's nice and fresh in the streets this morning?\"\nses Bill, at last, in a trembling voice.\n\nGinger started and looked at 'im.  \"I didn't notice, mate,\" he ses.  Then\n'e got up and patted Bill on the back, very gentle, and sat down again.\n\n\"Anything wrong, Ginger?\"  asks Peter Russet, staring at 'im.\n\n\"It's that landlord,\" ses Ginger; \"there's straw down in the road\noutside, and they say that he's dying.  Pore old Bill don't know 'is own\nstrength.  The best thing you can do, old pal, is to go as far away as\nyou can, at once.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't wait a minnit if it was me,\" ses old Sam.\n\nBill groaned and hid 'is face in his 'ands, and then Peter Russet went\nand spoilt things by saying that the safest place for a murderer to 'ide\nin was London.  Bill gave a dreadful groan when 'e said murderer, but 'e\nup and agreed with Peter, and all Sam and Ginger Dick could do wouldn't\nmake 'im alter his mind.  He said that he would shave off 'is beard and\nmoustache, and when night came 'e would creep out and take a lodging\nsomewhere right the other end of London.\n\n\"It'll soon be dark,\" ses Ginger, \"and your own brother wouldn't know you\nnow, Bill.  Where d'you think of going?\"\n\nBill shook his 'ead.  \"Nobody must know that, mate,\" he ses.  \"I must go\ninto hiding for as long as I can--as long as my money lasts; I've only\ngot six pounds left.\"\n\n\"That'll last a long time if you're careful,\" ses Ginger.\n\n\"I want a lot more,\" ses Bill.  \"I want you to take this silver ring as a\nkeepsake, Ginger.  If I 'ad another six pounds or so I should feel much\nsafer.  'Ow much 'ave you got, Ginger?\"\n\n\"Not much,\" ses Ginger, shaking his 'ead.\n\n\"Lend it to me, mate,\" ses Bill, stretching out his 'and.  \"You can easy\nget another ship.  Ah, I wish I was you; I'd be as 'appy as 'appy if I\nhadn't got a penny.\"\n\n\"I'm very sorry, Bill,\" ses Ginger, trying to smile, \"but I've already\npromised to lend it to a man wot we met this evening.  A promise is a\npromise, else I'd lend it to you with pleasure.\"\n\n\"Would you let me be 'ung for the sake of a few pounds, Ginger?\"  ses\nBill, looking at 'im reproach-fully.  \"I'm a desprit man, Ginger, and I\nmust 'ave that money.\"\n\nAfore pore Ginger could move he suddenly clapped 'is hand over 'is mouth\nand flung 'im on the bed.  Ginger was like a child in 'is hands, although\nhe struggled like a madman, and in five minutes 'e was laying there with\na towel tied round his mouth and 'is arms and legs tied up with the cord\noff of Sam's chest.\n\n\"I'm very sorry, Ginger,\" ses Bill, as 'e took a little over eight pounds\nout of Ginger's pocket.  \"I'll pay you back one o' these days, if I can.\nIf you'd got a rope round your neck same as I 'ave you'd do the same as\nI've done.\"\n\nHe lifted up the bedclothes and put Ginger inside and tucked 'im up.\nGinger's face was red with passion and 'is eyes starting out of his 'ead.\n\n\"Eight and six is fifteen,\" ses Bill, and just then he 'eard somebody\ncoming up the stairs.  Ginger 'eard it, too, and as Peter Russet came\ninto the room 'e tried all 'e could to attract 'is attention by rolling\n'is 'ead from side to side.\n\n\"Why, 'as Ginger gone to bed?\" ses Peter.  \"Wot's up, Ginger?\"\n\n\"He's all right,\" ses Bill; \"just a bit of a 'eadache.\"\n\nPeter stood staring at the bed, and then 'e pulled the clothes off and\nsaw pore Ginger all tied up, and making awful eyes at 'im to undo him.\n\n\"I 'ad to do it, Peter,\" ses Bill.  \"I wanted some more money to escape\nwith, and 'e wouldn't lend it to me.  I 'aven't got as much as I want\nnow.  You just came in in the nick of time.  Another minute and you'd ha'\nmissed me.  'Ow much 'ave you got?\"\n\n\"Ah, I wish I could lend you some, Bill,\" ses Peter Russet, turning pale,\n\"but I've 'ad my pocket picked; that's wot I came back for, to get some\nfrom Ginger.\"\n\nBill didn't say a word.\n\n\"You see 'ow it is, Bill,\" ses Peter, edging back toward the door; \"three\nmen laid 'old of me and took every farthing I'd got.\"\n\n\"Well, I can't rob you, then,\" ses Bill, catching 'old of 'im.\n\"Whoever's money this is,\" he ses, pulling a handful out o' Peter's\npocket, \"it can't be yours.  Now, if you make another sound I'll knock\nyour 'ead off afore I tie you up.\"\n\n\"Don't tie me up, Bill,\" ses Peter, struggling.\n\n\"I can't trust you,\" ses Bill, dragging 'im over to the washstand and\ntaking up the other towel; \"turn round.\"\n\nPeter was a much easier job than Ginger Dick, and arter Bill 'ad done 'im\n'e put 'im in alongside o' Ginger and covered 'em up, arter first tying\nboth the gags round with some string to prevent 'em slipping.\n\n\"Mind, I've only borrowed it,\" he ses, standing by the side o' the bed;\n\"but I must say, mates, I'm disappointed in both of you.  If either of\nyou 'ad 'ad the misfortune wot I've 'ad, I'd have sold the clothes off my\nback to 'elp you.  And I wouldn't 'ave waited to be asked neither.\"\n\nHe stood there for a minute very sorrowful, and then 'e patted both their\n'eads and went downstairs.  Ginger and Peter lay listening for a bit, and\nthen they turned their pore bound-up faces to each other and tried to\ntalk with their eyes.\n\nThen Ginger began to wriggle and try and twist the cords off, but 'e\nmight as well 'ave tried to wriggle out of 'is skin.  The worst of it was\nthey couldn't make known their intentions to each other, and when Peter\nRusset leaned over 'im and tried to work 'is gag off by rubbing it up\nagin 'is nose, Ginger pretty near went crazy with temper.  He banged\nPeter with his 'ead, and Peter banged back, and they kept it up till\nthey'd both got splitting 'eadaches, and at last they gave up in despair\nand lay in the darkness waiting for Sam.\n\nAnd all this time Sam was sitting in the Red Lion, waiting for them.  He\nsat there quite patient till twelve o'clock and then walked slowly 'ome,\nwondering wot 'ad happened and whether Bill had gone.\n\nGinger was the fust to 'ear 'is foot on the stairs, and as he came into\nthe room, in the darkness, him an' Peter Russet started shaking their bed\nin a way that scared old Sam nearly to death.  He thought it was Bill\ncarrying on agin, and 'e was out o' that door and 'arf-way downstairs\nafore he stopped to take breath.  He stood there trembling for about ten\nminutes, and then, as nothing 'appened, he walked slowly upstairs agin on\ntiptoe, and as soon as they heard the door creak Peter and Ginger made\nthat bed do everything but speak.\n\n\"Is that you, Bill?\"  ses old Sam, in a shaky voice, and standing ready\nto dash downstairs agin.\n\nThere was no answer except for the bed, and Sam didn't know whether Bill\nwas dying or whether 'e 'ad got delirium trimmings.  All 'e did know was\nthat 'e wasn't going to sleep in that room.  He shut the door gently and\nwent downstairs agin, feeling in 'is pocket for a match, and, not finding\none, 'e picked out the softest stair 'e could find and, leaning his 'ead\nagin the banisters, went to sleep.\n\nIt was about six o'clock when 'e woke up, and broad daylight.  He was\nstiff and sore all over, and feeling braver in the light 'e stepped\nsoftly upstairs and opened the door.  Peter and Ginger was waiting for\n'im, and as he peeped in 'e saw two things sitting up in bed with their\n'air standing up all over like mops and their faces tied up with\nbandages.  He was that startled 'e nearly screamed, and then 'e stepped\ninto the room and stared at 'em as if he couldn't believe 'is eyes.\n\n\"Is that you, Ginger?\" he ses.  \"Wot d'ye mean by making sights of\nyourselves like that?  'Ave you took leave of your senses?\"\n\nGinger and Peter shook their 'eads and rolled their eyes, and then Sam\nsee wot was the matter with 'em.  Fust thing 'e did was to pull out 'is\nknife and cut Ginger's gag off, and the fust thing Ginger did was to call\n'im every name 'e could lay his tongue to.\n\n\"You wait a moment,\" he screams, 'arf crying with rage.  \"You wait till I\nget my 'ands loose and I'll pull you to pieces.  The idea o' leaving us\nlike this all night, you old crocodile.  I 'eard you come in.  I'll pay\nyou.\"\n\nSam didn't answer 'im.  He cut off Peter Russet's gag, and Peter Russet\ncalled 'im 'arf a score o' names without taking breath.\n\n\"And when Ginger's finished I'll 'ave a go at you,\" he ses.  \"Cut off\nthese lines.\"\n\n\"At once, d'ye hear?\"  ses Ginger.  \"Oh, you wait till I get my 'ands on\nyou.\"\n\nSam didn't answer 'em; he shut up 'is knife with a click and then 'e sat\nat the foot o' the bed on Ginger's feet and looked at 'em.  It wasn't the\nfust time they'd been rude to 'im, but as a rule he'd 'ad to put up with\nit.  He sat and listened while Ginger swore 'imself faint.\n\n\"That'll do,\" he ses, at last; \"another word and I shall put the\nbedclothes over your 'ead.  Afore I do anything more I want to know wot\nit's all about.\"\n\nPeter told 'im, arter fust calling 'im some more names, because Ginger\nwas past it, and when 'e'd finished old Sam said 'ow surprised he was\nat them for letting Bill do it, and told 'em how they ought to 'ave\nprevented it.  He sat there talking as though 'e enjoyed the sound of 'is\nown voice, and he told Peter and Ginger all their faults and said wot\nsorrow it caused their friends.  Twice he 'ad to throw the bedclothes\nover their 'eads because o' the noise they was making.\n\n\"_Are you going--to undo--us?_\"  ses Ginger, at last.\n\n\"No, Ginger,\" ses old Sam; \"in justice to myself I couldn't do it.  Arter\nwot you've said--and arter wot I've said--my life wouldn't be safe.\nBesides which, you'd want to go shares in my money.\"\n\nHe took up 'is chest and marched downstairs with it, and about 'arf an\nhour arterward the landlady's 'usband came up and set 'em free.  As soon\nas they'd got the use of their legs back they started out to look for\nSam, but they didn't find 'im for nearly a year, and as for Bill, they\nnever set eyes on 'im again.",
