    "body": "They came in low, decelerating against dense air, while the passengers\ntalked, and laughed, and pressed their faces against the observation\nports.\n\nIn the ship's lounge, a squawk box crackled ... \"Twenty minutes,\" a\nmechanical voice said ... \"We land on Centauri IV in twenty minutes ...\nPassengers for Orion, Antares, Cygni, and Polaris, have your transfers\nready.\"\n\nEveryone laughed. The speaker clicked and went dead. And the boy who'd\nbeen gripping Claude Marshall's arm looked up.\n\n\"What's he mean, Pop? We don't _really_ have to transfer, do we?\"\n\nClaude Marshall smiled. \"No, Billy. This is as far as we're going--as\nfar as anyone's going.\"\n\n\"But he said--\"\n\n\"He was only joking, Billy. Maybe someday people will be going to those\nplaces, but not now.\" He glanced at his wife, sitting with her hands\nfolded in her lap.... \"I'm glad it's over, Joan,\" he said. \"It's been a\nlong trip--a very long trip.\"\n\nThe woman nodded. She had dark hair, and blue eyes, and minute\nlines of maturity around her eyes and mouth that seemed to soften,\nrather than age her. She looked almost too young to have mothered a\nnine-year-old boy--but of course that was one of the requirements.\n\n\"Is this where we're going to live?\" the boy asked.\n\nClaude looked out the port. \"Yes, Billy. This is where we're going to\nlive.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I've already told you why. Don't you remember when I showed you the\npictures, and asked you how you'd like to live where you'd have lots of\nroom to play, and wouldn't have to worry about the bombs or anything?\"\n\n\"Sure, Pop,\" the boy said. \"I remember. But tell me about it again?\"\n\nClaude looked at his wife; watched her nod, and answer his smile. \"All\nright,\" he said. He raised his arm over the foam-cushion seat-back till\nit rested on the boy's shoulder.\n\n\"You see, Billy, things back on Earth are pretty bad--have been for\nover a hundred years now. There's too many cities, too many wars, and\ntoo many people--it's mostly too many people. They don't have room to\nmove around any more the way they used to....\n\n\"To make it worse there are always some people who figure that someone\nelse has a little more room than they have, so they try to take it away\nfrom them by starting a war. Not that war ever solves anything. It's\njust that some people think it will.\"\n\n\"That's why we left, huh, Pop?\"\n\n\"Yes, Billy. That's why we left. The problem was to find some place\nnew; some place where a man had room to move--room to breathe. For\na long while it didn't look as if there was such a place--not in\nour solar system anyhow. But one day a few years before you were\nborn, a fellow by the name of Vincent Taibi made a trip out here to\nCentauri.... It was a long trip. Took him thirteen years to get out\nhere and back. But the important thing is that he came back with some\nnews.... He came back and reported that there was an uninhabited planet\nout here, just about the size of the Earth, that was as fresh and new\nas it was the day God made it.\"\n\n\"That's when we got on this ship. Right, Pop?\"\n\nClaude frowned. \"Well, not exactly. You see, Son, to begin with this is\na long trip--so long, and so expensive, that no one except maybe a few\nmillionaires would be able to afford it. Anyhow, the government wanted\n_young_ people out here: people who could colonize the place.... They\nran a lot of tests, Son.\"\n\n\"Tests?\"\n\nClaude nodded and turned to his wife. \"The tests,\" he said. \"You\nremember the tests, Joan?\"\n\n\"Yes, Claude. I remember. It's been six years, but I remember them as\nif they happened yesterday.\"\n\n\"I don't, Pop.\"\n\n\"That's 'cause you were too young, Son. You didn't have to take the\ntests.... You were lucky.\"\n\n\"Claude! Billy's not interested in that. Besides they were necessary.\"\n\n\"Necessary! All those psychiatrists? Oh come, Joan.... I felt as if\nthey were picking my brain with an ice pick!\"\n\n\"But they had to be careful, Claude.\"\n\n\"Careful, yes.... But eight months of tests--every day!\"\n\n\"Claude!\" The woman's tone was severe.\n\n\"Why did they have to be careful, Pop?\" Billy asked.\n\n\"They wanted to be sure, Son. They didn't want anyone out here who was\nsick, or lazy, or who wanted to start a war. They figured if the right\nkind of people came out here, Centifor would stay as fresh and clean as\nit was the day that Captain Taibi first landed here.\"\n\nThe boy looked out the porthole. \"We'll sure have lots of room here,\nwon't we, Pop?\"\n\n\"Yes, Son. We'll have lots of room. The government's given us title to\na hundred acres of what's just about the best land in the Universe....\nI showed you the pictures of our land, didn't I?\"\n\n\"Sure, Pop. Lots of times.\"\n\nThe woman laughed. \"About a thousand times, I'd imagine.... Those\npictures have been looked at so much, they're frayed at the corners.\"\n\n\n\nThey landed on a concrete apron, nestled between ridges of rolling\nhills. The jets belched, hissed, went out, and from a ranch type\nstructure at the edge of the area, a jeep, towing a portable ramp moved\nout to meet them.\n\nThere was a gentle bump. Hatches hissed open. And then the passengers\nbegan to move down the ramp.\n\nAmong the last to emerge into the bright, warm sunshine, were Claude\nand Joan Marshall. Each clasping a hand of their son, they stood at\nthe top of the ramp, breathing deep gulps of sweet-smelling air, and\nstaring at the boundless horizon of the fresh, new world.\n\nClean and unspoiled it was, like an immense green carpet, dotted with\nclear, blue lakes, and billions of wildflowers that soaked nourishment\nout of topsoil twenty inches deep.\n\nA paradise planet, free of bustling crowds and concrete cities.\nUntainted by littered alleyways, and dirty kiosks, and the abominable\nsmells of cosmopolitan chaos.... In place of these was a sun-soaked,\nfairy-like landscape capped by fleecy white clouds that hung motionless\nin a sky of robin's-egg blue.\n\nClaude stabbed an index finger at the patchwork quilt of green and\nyellow.\n\n\"Look Joan.... Our land! You can see it from here!\"\n\n\"Where, Claude?\"\n\n\"Out there.... See? Way out. Beyond those lakes!\"\n\n\"Oh, Claude. How can you be sure?\"\n\n\"I remember it from the maps--and the pictures.... Our land is just\ntwenty-eight miles from this landing strip, and you cross three ridges\nof hills to get to it.... See? One ... two ... three!\"\n\n\"Is that where we're going to live, Pop?\"\n\n\"Yes, Son. That's where we're going to live. And there isn't a better\npiece of land anywhere.... I know!\"\n\nAt the gentle urging of the attendant, they moved off the ramp and\nmelted into the group of passengers drifting toward the ranch-type\nbuilding at the edge of the area. A sign over the building said:\nRECEPTION CENTER, and a man was standing in front of it. The man wasn't\nold by Earth standards, but leathery skin, and steel-grey patches\nof hair around his temples made him look very ancient alongside the\ncomposite youth of the newly-arrived settlers.\n\nThe older man waited till the group had formed a tight semi-circle\naround him. Then he smiled and held up both hands.\n\n\"Welcome to Centifor,\" he said. \"My name is Leon Stubbs, and I am the\nDirector of Colonization.\"\n\nHe waited till the undercurrent of muttering had died down, and went\non: \"I know how anxious you all are to settle on your own land, but\nbecause immediate transportation is unavailable, there will be a slight\ndelay. During this time you will be quartered here at the reception\ncenter.\"\n\nClaude Marshall leaned close to his wife's ear. \"We're lucky, Joan,\" he\nwhispered. \"We don't have to worry about transportation. We can _walk_\nto _our_ land if we have to.\"\n\nLeon Stubbs said: \"If any of you have any questions, feel free to speak\nup.... That's why I'm here.\" He stopped, and pointed at a thin-faced\nyouth with one arm raised while a young, and obviously pregnant girl\nheld onto the other.\n\n\"Yes, Sir.\"\n\n\"We've been wondering,\" the youth said. \"Are our building materials\nready yet?\"\n\n\"Some of them are,\" the director said, \"and some of them aren't.\nProduction here isn't quite what it should be yet. When you've been\nhere a while, you'll realize that because of our relatively small\nnumbers, and comparative inexperience in economic matters, we're a\ntightly-knit group.... We have to be.\n\n\"There is one thing however that works in our favor. There are no\nirrationals or psychological deviants on Centifor. The tests took care\nof that. They were rough, I know. They were supposed to be rough. And\nnow that you're here you'll all be facing another test.... The test of\npractical application.\n\n\"Some of you are fortunate in the respect that you've been awarded\nland reasonably close to the spaceport area. Some of you are not so\nfortunate, and will have to travel several hundred miles. Perhaps those\nof you in this latter category will find some consolation in the fact\nthat since you left Terra, the government has started a movement to\npopulate the other side of the planet. As a matter of fact, all future\napplications will be assigned to that area.\"\n\nClaude looked at his wife. And she looked back at him. They didn't\nspeak. They didn't have to. It was common knowledge that Centifor was\na planet of contrast. It was a Jekyll and Hyde planet.... One side was\na veritable Utopia. And the other? Claude shuddered at the thought of\nhacking a living out of the razor-backed mountains and bare patches of\nrocky soil that were frozen stiff nine months out of every thirteen.\n\n\"If there are no other questions,\" the Director said. \"We'll get on\nwith the business of setting you up in temporary quarters.\"\n\n\n\nTwelve hours later, Claude Marshall and his family stood on the ramp of\nthe spaceport watching the blue-tinted sun edge itself over the rim of\nthe planet.\n\nThe decision to pack a few immediate necessities and walk to the\nhomestead instead of waiting for transportation had been arrived at the\nnight before. It was ridiculous, Claude had argued, to waste time at\nthe reception center, when the culmination of a ten year dream lay just\ntwenty-eight miles away. Especially so, since the Director had informed\nthem that the materials for their prefab home was already waiting for\nthem on the land.\n\nNor were they alone in their eagerness to begin a new way of life.\nOther settlers--some of them burdened-down with supplies that almost\nequalled their own weight--had already started a trek over the virgin\nlandscape. In twos and threes, they plodded into the gently-sloping\nvalley. Some of them moved slowly, some eagerly. All of them looked\nlike tiny ants on a giant pool table.\n\nMarshall adjusted the knapsack across his shoulders with an air of\nfinality. \"Let's go, Joan,\" he said. \"Stay close, Billy. We have a\nlong walk ahead of us.\"\n\nThey started into the valley.\n\nTwo hours later they stopped to rest. They stopped on a patch of rich,\ngreen turf in the shadow of a broad-leaf tree. The spaceport, flanked\nby its low-slung buildings was still visible, but from seven miles\naway the buildings looked incredibly tiny. Like miniatures out of a\nChristmas kit. But the thing that impressed them most was the quiet--a\nstrange sort of quiet, free of the whir of copter blades, land-car\nhorns, and other nerve-shattering noises. Instead, there was only the\nrustle of a mild breeze through the tree branches, and the sound of\ntheir own breathing.\n\nMarshall lay on his back, his fingers laced behind his neck.\n\n\"I feel rested, Joan,\" he said. \"We've just walked seven miles, but I\nfeel rested.\"\n\n\"I know, Claude. I feel the same way. It must be the air. The air feels\ndifferent.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't it be nice if it'd always stay this way. Fresh and unspoiled,\nI mean. I know it won't, but wouldn't it be nice if it did.\"\n\n\"It will, Claude. It will for as long as we live anyhow, and for as\nlong as Billy lives. That's what's important. We're very lucky, Claude.\"\n\n\"I can't help thinking of the people back on Earth. I feel sorry for\nthem.\"\n\n\"They could do what we did. They could take the tests.\"\n\n\"I know. But even if they did, what would they have? Who'd want to\nhomestead the _other_ side of this planet? Who'd want to live out\nthere anyway?\"\n\n\"I would, Pop,\" Billy said.\n\n\"No you wouldn't, Son. Don't you remember those black mountains we saw\nfrom the ship when we came in?\"\n\n\"Sure, Pop.\"\n\n\"Well that's what the other side of the planet is like. Only you\ncouldn't tell what it was really like because we were too high. You\nwouldn't like it if you had to live there. It's cold, and rocky, and\nthere's only six hours of daylight out of every twenty-six.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't like it then,\" the boy said. \"I don't like the dark.\"\n\nClaude got up and looked at his wife. \"Shall we move along,\" he said.\n\nThey pushed ahead. Eagerly, yet slowly enough to absorb the world's\nendless beauty; stopping at the crest of each new hill; kneeling at\nthe shores of crystal lakes to quench their thirst; and scooping\nup handfuls of rich, black soil in spots where the turf had become\ndislodged.\n\nThe sun of Centauri was almost at zenith when they approached the crest\nof the ridge that bounded the Marshall homestead.\n\nClaude's pace, which had been quickening steadily for the final mile,\nburst into a jagged trot for the final hundred uphill yards. At the top\nof the hill he stopped, staring into the lush, green valley, ignoring\nhis family who'd been unable to keep pace with his eagerness.\n\nThe homestead was all that the color photos had advertised--and more.\nIt was all there. The flat, rich turf, the stream running through the\ncenter of the valley, and the grove of trees under which he'd build the\nprefab house.\n\nHe'd anticipated the moment so many times, it was hard to believe it\nhad really arrived. But it was real--it was. Everything was exactly as\nhe'd expected to find it ... except for one thing.\n\nAlways in his imagination, the land had been waiting for him to claim\nit. Him alone--and his wife and son.\n\nBut they weren't alone.... There were other people on the land. On his\nland!\n\nAnd they were acting as if they lived there!\n\n\n\nThere were three of them--a man, a woman, and a boy of about nineteen.\nThe woman appeared to be cooking a meal over a wood fire, while the man\nand boy were arranging a foundation pattern with part of the stack of\nbuilding materials which had been ear-marked for the house.\n\nFor his house!\n\nJoan and Billy drew up alongside him, and together they stared at the\nintruders.\n\n\"Who are they, Claude?\" his wife said. \"What does it mean?\"\n\n\"I don't know, honey. Maybe they just stopped here to eat. That's what\nit must be.\"\n\n\"But the men. The way they're measuring.... As if they're going to\nbuild.\"\n\n\"We'll straighten it out, Joan.... Probably some mistake. I have our\nland title. That'll prove they've made a mistake. Come on. We'll talk\nto them.\"\n\nThe intruders stopped what they were doing as they approached, and the\nman--a huge, block-shouldered fellow in a leather jacket--pushed out a\nhand.\n\nThe man said: \"Hello. My name's Whiting--Bruce Whiting.\"\n\nClaude took the hand. \"Claude Marshall,\" he said. \"And this is my wife\nand my son.\"\n\nThe man who called himself Whiting nodded, and looked over at his wife.\n\"We're fixing dinner,\" he said. \"Why don't you and your family join us\nbefore you push on?\"\n\nClaude watched the man's face while he spoke. It was an open face.\nGuileless. With ruddy skin and mild, grey eyes that twinkled a bit at\nthe corners.\n\n\"We're not _pushing_ on,\" he said evenly. \"We're staying. This is\n_our_ land.\"\n\nBruce Whiting smiled. \"There must be some mistake. This land is ours.\nThe boy and I are just fixing to start building.\"\n\nClaude shook his head. \"Not here you're not. Not on this land.\" He\nspoke quietly; trying to keep his voice pitched below the emotion that\nchurned up inside him.\n\n\"What's wrong, Dad?\" The man's son joined them.... He was a big\nstrapping lad, with sandy hair and very bright skin.\n\n\"These people are looking for their homestead,\" the man with the jacket\nsaid. \"They think _this_ is their site.\"\n\n\"You think wrong, Mister,\" the youth said. \"We double checked this\nlocation three times before we made camp.... Right?\" He turned to the\nolder man for confirmation.\n\nWhiting nodded. \"The boy's right. This land is ours. We've got a deed\nto prove it.\"\n\n\"So have I,\" Claude said frowning. \"It's right here in the luggage....\nWait. I'll show you....\" He bent over, unzipping the knapsack and\nrummaged around till he produced the manila envelope that held the\ntitle papers.\n\nBruce Whiting examined them carefully; first the neat rows of fine\nprint, then the dozen glossy color-photos which had been taken on the\nproperty from strategic angles. He shook his head and turned to his son.\n\n\"Get _our_ titles, Frank,\" he said.\n\nThe boy left, returning within seconds with a similar manila envelope.\nBruce Whiting opened it and pushed a handful of papers at Claude.\n\nWhile his wife and son watched, Claude Marshall went through the papers\nmethodically.... They were all there. All the measurements; looking\nlike duplicates, backed up by photos that had apparently been developed\nfrom the same negatives.... He glanced at his wife.\n\n\"Something's wrong, Joan,\" he said. \"Mr. Whiting has a claim on this\nland too. It's just like ours.... Exactly!\"\n\n\"But I don't understand, Claude.\"\n\n\"It's not too hard to understand, Mrs. Marshall,\" Whiting said. \"It\njust means that someone in Washington loused up the detail. They're\nalways making mistakes like that.... I figure some clerk--\"\n\n\"But what are we supposed to _do_?\"\n\nBruce Whiting moved his shoulders. \"I don't know, Mrs. Marshall. I just\ndon't know.... After all we were here _first_. Why don't you take it up\nwith the Colonization Director?... Maybe there's another tract he could\ngive you.\"\n\n\"I don't want another tract,\" Claude said flatly. \"I want this one.\"\n\n\"So do I, Mr. Marshall.\"\n\n\"But the land's mine!\"\n\n\"Is it? How about _my_ title? It's just as valid as yours.\"\n\n\"That'll be for the law to decide,\" Claude said grimly. \"And we'll\nfight you on it. By God, we'll fight you on it all the way from here to\nWashington and back!\"\n\n\"That's up to you, of course. In the meantime, may I remind you that I\nhold possession?\"\n\nClaude Marshall bit his lip.\n\n\"Let's go Joan,\" he said.\n\n\"Where, Claude?\"\n\n\"Back to the spaceport. We'll get a ruling on this.\"\n\n\"But it's getting dark. Can't we make camp someplace and go back\ntomorrow?\"\n\n\"I'm hungry,\" Billy said.\n\n\"We can eat later, Son.\"\n\nBruce Whiting continued to regard them sullenly. Then abruptly, his\nface softened. \"Wait,\" he said. \"Don't go. Your wife's right, Mr.\nMarshall. You can't make the trip after dark. Why don't you and your\nfamily camp here for the night.... Alice has supper nearly ready and\nthere's more than enough to go around....\"\n\n\"We have our own rations,\" Claude said.\n\nBruce Whiting spread out his hands. \"Look, Mr. Marshall. I know how you\nfeel. I know, because it's the same way _I_ feel. I guess a man can't\nhelp the way he feels when something threatens the thing he's been\ndreaming about all his life. But it isn't my fault that this happened\nany more than it's your fault. Since the problem concerns both of us, I\nsuggest we sit down and discuss it like intelligent human beings.\"\n\n\"Mr. Whiting's right,\" Joan said. \"After all it isn't his fault--\"\n\n\"Another thing,\" Bruce Whiting went on. \"I'm expecting a half-trac out\nhere tomorrow with some supplies. If you and your family wanted to,\nthere's no reason why we couldn't all ride back with him.... Maybe we\ncould get this thing straightened out then and still be friends.\"\n\nClaude flicked a look toward the far-off hills that were haloed by the\nlast rays of a strange sun. Within moments it would be dark. And a few\nyards away a woman threw another log on the fire and the pungent aroma\nof boiling coffee drifted across his nostrils.\n\n\"I'm hungry,\" Billy repeated.\n\nClaude held out his hand.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"As you say: this isn't our fault. We're just\ncaught in the middle.\"\n\n\n\nThey ate picnic-style, off plastic dishes, while Bruce Whiting kept up\na continuous stream of conversation, aided from time to time by his\ncomely wife.\n\nThe Whiting's story was a familiar one. He'd been with an advertising\nagency when the colonization urge had struck him.... That was ten years\nago.... He'd talked it over with his wife, and together they'd weighed\nthe chances of surviving the rigid tests that eliminated 97% of the\napplicants.\n\nThe story had a pattern you could play by ear. Just another man, and\nanother woman, and another boy now in his teens, who'd grown tired of\nthe struggle for survival in a world that begrudged a man the space\noccupied by his own body.\n\nAnd when the meal was over, Joan helped Alice Whiting with the dishes,\nwhile the men sat around the fire and smoked. It was dark out now--a\nstrange kind of darkness, split only by billions of incredibly bright\nstars and the nearby glow of the crackling wood fire.\n\nBruce Whiting's cordiality was contagious too. Claude found himself\ntalking now; describing his wants, his ideas, and his ideals. And when\nthe women returned to the circle, the conversation turned to other\nsubjects. They discussed clothes, their children, and the future of the\nplanet.\n\nOnly one subject was carefully avoided.\n\nAnd that was the one that was foremost in the minds of all of them.\n\nThey were still talking when the fire had settled into weary heaps\nof smouldering embers. Then the two families excused themselves and\nretired to the canvas lean-to's wondering what the next day would hold\nin store for them.\n\n\n\nThe blue sun of Centauri was almost at zenith the next day, when the\nhalf-trac arrived with the supplies.\n\nThe driver--an amiable man--listened patiently while Bruce and Claude\nrelated the mixup, and as had been expected, agreed to transport them\nback to the base.\n\nThe two families rode together in the open back of the vehicle as it\njounced over the mildly sloping terrain. And yet the ride was not\nunpleasant. The immensity of the planet was breathtaking. It was\nexactly as the colorcasts had pictured it--only better, incredibly\nbetter. No TV travelogue could adequately describe the tang of the air,\nor the scent of the sweet-smelling grass.\n\nGod had indeed been generous with this portion of the planet.\n\nIt was hard to believe that the opposite side was a rocky wasteland\nthat would probably fight colonization for another thousand years.\n\nAlmost before they knew it, they were at the spaceport. Sometime during\nthe night, another ship had arrived. It stood majestically at the far\nend of the apron, towering over a knot of tiny figures grouped around\nthe rudder stanchions.\n\nThe driver swooped past them and brought the half-trac to a halt in\nfront of the reception center where they observed the Colonization\nDirector watching them through the window of his office.\n\nInside, Leon Stubbs greeted them cordially and ushered them into an\ninner office containing a metal desk and a dozen file cabinets.\n\nThe Director listened patiently, shaking his head from time to time\nand muttering remarks about government inefficiency.... When they'd\nfinished, he ran his hand through his greying hair.\n\n\"This, of course, is an outrage, Gentlemen,\" he said. \"But before I\ncan do anything, I'll have to check both your claims.\" He indicated\nthe file cabinets. \"It may take a little time but I'll get at it right\naway. As a matter of fact I believe they're serving lunch at the mess\nhall now. Why don't you all have lunch and come back in about an hour.\nI'll know more about the situation then.\"\n\nLeon Stubbs shuffled through some papers on the desk, indicating\ndismissal. The two men joined their families in the anteroom.\n\nAfter an awkward silence, Bruce Whiting and his family excused\nthemselves, leaving the Marshall's alone.\n\n\"What did he say, Claude? Tell me! What did he say?\"\n\n\"He doesn't know yet, honey. He's checking the claims. We're supposed\nto come back in an hour.\"\n\n\"But it will be all right, won't it. It's got to be all right!\"\n\n\"I don't know, Joan. So help me, I don't know.... We can't both have\nthe land. That's for sure. One of us will have to settle for someplace\nelse.\"\n\n\"Suppose we _did_ have to take another tract, Claude. Would you be\ndisappointed--I mean, really disappointed.... After all, isn't the\nimportant thing the fact that we're here?\"\n\nClaude managed a smile. \"I suppose so,\" he admitted. \"It's just that\nit comes as sort of a letdown. For almost seven years now we've been\nlooking at the pictures of _this_ land. We knew where we'd build the\nhouse, what portion we'd farm.... I know every tree, every square inch\nof it.... And now--\"\n\n\"But there's other land. We've only seen a small portion of the planet.\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"Not like this. This claim has everything. What's more, Whiting knows\nit. That's why he'll fight us on it all the way.\"\n\n\"They seem like nice people. Claude. Couldn't we talk to them ... make\nsome sort of deal?\"\n\n\"A deal? What sort of deal?\"\n\n\"A hundred acres is a lot of land--an awful lot of land.... Maybe the\nWhitings would--\"\n\n\"Uh uh. No good. I've already felt him out on that. I had the same idea\nlast night, so I came right out and asked him if he'd settle for fifty\nacres apiece.... He refused. Oh, he was nice enough about it. But he\ngave me to understand it was all or nothing with him.\"\n\n\"I'm hungry,\" Billy said.\n\nClaude looked at his wife. \"So am I. Let's go over to the mess hall.\nThat's where the Whitings went, I think.\"\n\n\"Claude?\"\n\n\"Yes, Joan.\"\n\n\"Let's not sit with them, if we meet them there.\"\n\n\"All right, honey. Let's not.\"\n\nThey were halfway to the door when Leon Stubbs came out of the inner\noffice. He smiled.\n\n\"Mind stepping inside a moment?\" he said.\n\nWhen Claude hesitated, he added: \"Perhaps Mrs. Marshall had better come\nin too.\"\n\nThey followed him inside where the Director indicated two chairs\nalongside the desk.\n\n\"I've been checking your claims,\" he said. \"And since you were still\nhere, I didn't think it advisable to prolong the suspense.\"\n\nClaude glanced at his wife.\n\n\"You mean it's all right ... the land is ours?\"\n\nThe Director sat down and spread open a pair of folders on the desk.\nFor a long while he stared at them--comparing them. He shook his head.\n\n\"I'm afraid not, Mr. Marshall. I'm afraid it isn't all right.\"\n\n\"But our claim. It's valid, isn't it?\"\n\nLeon Stubbs ran a hand through his greying hair. \"I don't know,\" he\nsaid. \"Naturally the fault for processing duplicate claims lies with\nthe colonization bureau in Washington. Eventually, I suppose it will\nbe up to them to decide on the disposition of this case.... However,\nbecause of the time-lag in communications, I have full authority to\npass down temporary decisions in matters of this type.... And because\nMr. Whiting's claim is dated several days ahead of yours, I must in all\nfairness award the land to him.... You and your wife can appeal that\ndecision of course.\"\n\n\"We'll appeal, Mr. Stubbs,\" Claude said angrily. \"After all, this mess\nis the government's fault. Not ours! It's up to them to straighten it\nout.\"\n\n\"That's up to you,\" Leon Stubbs said. \"Although I'm sure you realize\nthat in the meantime you'll have to make some temporary arrangements.\"\n\n\"Temporary arrangements?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Marshall. Even assuming the government decides in your\nfavor--which I doubt--you'll have to live _somewhere_ while the case is\nbeing processed.... And that will take some time.\"\n\n\"How long?\"\n\nLeon Stubbs shuffled through the papers again.\n\n\"You know about the time-lag, don't you?\"\n\n\"No. What about the time-lag?\"\n\nThe Director met his stare. \"I thought you knew. Actually the only\ncommunication we have with Terra short of space travel, is by short\nwave radio, and radio waves as you may know travel at approximately the\nspeed of light. Since we are approximately 4.4 light-years away from\nEarth, a round trip message to Washington would take about nine years.\nThis of course does not take into consideration the time needed to\nprocess your case.\"\n\nClaude kept watching the Director's face while he spoke. He _looked_\nlike an honest man. To all intents and purposes he was simply a public\nservant performing a distasteful duty. Yet there was something about\nhis voice that had an all-too-familiar ring.... Something that hinted\nhe was leading up to an offer.\n\nClaude cleared his throat. \"All right, Mr. Stubbs. So you've convinced\nme of the futility of appealing the claim. What now?\"\n\nLeon Stubbs bit off the end of a cigar and lit it before answering.\n\n\"I've arranged to give you and your family an alternate claim, Mr.\nMarshall. Of course it isn't quite as desirable as the original one.\nBut under the circumstances--\" He let the sentence trail off.\n\n\"I see,\" Claude said. \"And where is this alternate claim?\"\n\nStubbs examined the end of his cigar.\n\n\"It's on the other side of the planet, Mr. Marshall. I'm sorry, but\nthat's the best I can do.\"\n\nAt his elbow, Claude caught the sharp intake of his wife's breath.\n\n\"It really isn't _too_ bad,\" the Director went on. \"Many of the reports\nabout the cold-side have been exaggerated.\"\n\n\"I'm sure they have,\" Claude said bitterly. \"I'm sure it's just the\nplace to bring up a nine-year-old boy.\"\n\n\"Please Mr. Marshall. Don't be bitter. It isn't my fault.\"\n\nClaude got up placing his palms on the edge of the metal desk. He\nleaned forward till his face was only inches away from the Director's\ncigar, and said: \"Isn't it?\"\n\nThe Director didn't answer. Instead he got up and walked over to the\nopen window. For ten full seconds he stared out at the lush valley that\nflanked the spaceport. Then he turned.\n\n\"You want my advice, Mr. Marshall?\"\n\nClaude shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Go home,\" Leon Stubbs said. \"You can't bring up a boy on the\ncold-side. It just wouldn't work.\"\n\n\"But we just got here,\" Joan said. \"We sold everything we had to come\nhere!\"\n\nStubbs nodded. \"I know,\" he said. He indicated the folders. \"It's all\nthere in your records. Six years ago you left Terra with six-thousand\ncredits. But surely with that kind of money you could get a fresh start\nalmost anywhere.\"\n\n\"But we want to stay here, Mr. Stubbs.\"\n\nStubbs took a drag out of the cigar.\n\n\"I know,\" he said woodenly.\n\nClaude remained silent, regarding the conversation carefully. A pattern\nwas beginning to form now--a familiar pattern. He walked over to where\nthe Director was standing.\n\n\"Perhaps you could make a suggestion, Mr. Stubbs. Surely there must be\nopportunities on _this_ side of the planet for a man with six-thousand\ncredits?\"\n\n\"I'm not quite sure what you're getting at,\" Leon Stubbs said.\n\n\"I think you do, Mr. Stubbs,\" Claude retorted. \"I think we're both\ngetting at the same thing. Suppose we dispense with the subtleties and\nget down to cases.\"\n\nThe Director sat down at the desk pyramiding his fingertips.\n\n\"Very well, Mr. Marshall,\" he said. \"I'll be blunt. It's occurred to me\nthat if the date on your claim were changed, the land would naturally\nbe yours. The difficulty of course lies in the fact that there are\nduplicate records on Terra and we'd have to take care of the man who\nhandles them. Otherwise the discrepancy would show up eventually.\nActually, I want nothing for myself but these people in Washington--\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know,\" Claude interrupted. \"It's someone else who's getting\nthe money. It's _always_ someone else who's getting the money.\"\n\n\"It would take quite a bit, I'm afraid,\" the Director said ignoring the\nsarcasm.\n\n\"How much?\"\n\nThe Director stubbed out the end of his cigar. \"About five thousand,\"\nhe said. \"Yes. Five thousand ought to do it.\"\n\nClaude looked at his wife.\n\nAnd she looked back at him.\n\nOutside, Billy had tired of the seven-year-old magazine and was\nhammering on the door for admittance.\n\n\"Can we have a few minutes to think it over?\" Claude said.\n\n\"Certainly,\" Stubbs said amiably. \"And I want to make it quite clear,\nMr. Marshall, that this money is not for me. There's this fellow--\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know. There's this fellow in Washington. Come on Joan. Let's\nstep outside a moment.\"\n\n\n\nTen minutes later, Leon Stubbs answered their knock and ushered them\nto the desk chairs. After they were seated, he said: \"I take it you've\ntalked it over.\"\n\nClaude nodded. \"Yes, Mr. Stubbs. My wife and I talked it over and we\ncame to a decision.\"\n\n\"I'm glad,\" the Director said. \"And may I say I think you're doing a\nwise thing. Centifor's a beautiful place. Simply beautiful....\"\n\n\"Yes it is,\" Claude agreed. \"It is beautiful. That's why we'd like to\nsee it stay that way.\"\n\nThe Director raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"My wife and I talked it over,\" Claude went on, \"and we decided that\ntaking someone else's land whether it's done by theft, force, or\nbribery is wrong. We thought of this place as something fresh and\nclean. We thought all those tests we took were designed to keep people\nlike you out of here. Now it appears we were mistaken. We've talked it\nover, Mr. Stubbs, and we've decided to go back to Earth and expose you.\"\n\n\"But you can't,\" the Director said. \"You've--\"\n\n\"Yes we can,\" Claude said. \"The ships go back practically empty. A\nreturn berth will be no trouble at all. We're returning on the first\nship out.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we could make a better deal,\" Stubbs said. \"Perhaps five\nthousand is too much. Perhaps--\"\n\n\"No. No deals! Let's go Joan.\"\n\nThey went outside, into the fresh warm sunshine, staring at the torpedo\nshaped spaceship standing in the clearance area half-a-mile away.\n\nThey'd just started toward it, when a jeep squealed up alongside them.\nBruce Whiting was at the wheel.\n\n\"Hi,\" he said. \"Hop in. I'll give you a lift.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Claude said without bitterness. He helped his wife and son\ninto the rear seat and climbed in beside the driver.\n\n\"I suppose congratulations are in order,\" he said as the other man\nthrew the vehicle into gear. \"Stubbs tells me the land is yours now.\"\n\nThe driver nodded, inching down on the accelerator. The vehicle leaped\nforward. At seventy miles an hour, they swooped past the spaceship and\nthe knot of people standing in the shadow of the rudder stanchions.\n\n\"Hey. Slow up!\" Claude yelled. \"We're getting off here. We're booking\nreturn passage on that ship!\"\n\nWhiting didn't answer.\n\nThe low slung buildings of the clearance area leaped up at them and\npassed into the background. They were heading into open country now.\n\n\"Whiting! Turn around. We're staying here in the clearance area!\"\n\nWhiting's foot slacked off the accelerator. The speedometer dropped to\nfifty. But the vehicle kept moving into open country. The man at the\nwheel flicked a look at Claude and smiled.\n\n\"Congratulations, Mr. Marshall,\" he said. \"You've passed the final\ntest.\"\n\n\"Test? I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Let me explain then,\" Bruce Whiting said. \"In the first place my name\nisn't Whiting.... It's Reed--Paul Reed. I work for the government. This\nfinal test--the one you just went through--was designed to weed out any\nundesirables who might have slipped through our screening processes\nback on Earth.\"\n\n\"You mean this whole build up was just a test?\"\n\nThe other man nodded. \"We give it to every new arrival here. Now that\nyou've passed, I'm driving you out to your homestead site.\"\n\nClaude looked back at the newly-arrived spaceship and the tiny figures\nwho were huddled at its base.\n\n\"All those people,\" he said. \"You mean they still have to go through\nwhat we did?\"\n\nThe driver shook his head.\n\n\"No. Those people are going back to Earth. You see, Mr. Marshall, those\nare the people who offered Leon Stubbs the bribe.\"",
