Lapped in sloth and greed,\n\nHe fails in strenuous life to make a mark,\n\nThe placid Pug that paces in the park.=\n\n\n\nRound the slow circle of his nights and days\n\n`His life revolves in calm monotony.\n\nNot unsusceptible to casual praise,\n\n`And mildly moved by the approach of \"tea,\"\n\nNo forked and jagged lightning leaps and plays\n\nRound the slow circle of his nights and days.=\n\n\n\nHe scarcely turns his round protuberant eyes,\n\n`To mark the mood of animals or men.\n\nHis joy is limited to mild surmise\n\n`When a new biscuit swims into his ken.\n\nAnd when athwart his gaze a Rabbit flies,\n\nHe scarcely turns his round protuberant eyes.=\n\n\n\nAnd all the while the Shark in Southern seas\n\n`Pursues the paths of his pulsating quest,\n\nThough the thermometer at fierce degrees\n\n`Might well admonish him to take a rest,\n\nThe Pug at home snores in ignoble ease.\n\n(And all the while the Shark in Southern seas!)=\n\n\n\nIf Pugs like Sharks were brought up in the sea\n\n`And forced to swim long miles to find their food,\n\nTutored to front the Hake's hostility,\n\n`And beard the Lobster in his dangerous mood,\n\nWould not their lives more sane, more useful be,\n\nIf Pugs like Sharks were brought up in the sea?=\n\n\n\nThe placid Pug still paces in the park,\n\n`Untouched by thoughts of all that might have been.\n\nUndreaming that he might have \"steered his bark\"\n\n`Through many a stirring sight and stormy scene.\n\nBut being born a Pug and not a Shark\n\nThe placid Pug still paces in the park.=\n\n\n\n\nBALLAD FOR BISHOPS\n\n\n|BISHOPS and others who inhabit\n\nThe mansions of the blest on earth,\n\nGrieved by decline of infant birth,\n\nHave drawn attention to the rabbit.\n\nNot by design these good men work\n\nTo raise that beast to heights contested,\n\nBut by comparison, suggested,\n\nWith those who procreation shirk.=\n\n\n\nFor if a nation's moral status\n\nBe measured by prolific habit,\n\nBetween man and the meanest rabbit\n\nThere is an evident hiatus.=\n\n\n\nEach year, by lowest computations,\n\nSix times the rabbit rears her young,\n\nAnd frequent marriages among\n\nThe very closest blood relations\n\nIn very tender years ensure\n\nA constant stream of \"little strangers,\"\n\nWho, quickly grown to gallant rangers,\n\nSee that their families endure.=\n\n\n\nNot theirs to shirk paternal cares,\n\nMoved by considerations sordid,\n\nA child can always \"be afforded\";\n\nThe same applies to Belgian hares.=\n\n\n\nThese noble brutes, pure Duty's pendants,\n\nMay live to see their blood vermilion\n\nCoursing through something like a billion\n\nWholly legitimate descendants.=\n\n\n\nKnowledge's path is hard and stony,\n\nAnd some may read who unaware are\n\nThat rabbit brown and Belgian hare are\n\nBoth members of the genus Coney.=\n\n\n\nThe common hare, who lives in fields\n\nAnd never goes into a hole,\n\n(In this inferior to the mole)\n\nIn all things to the Belgian yields.=\n\n\n\nHe will, immoral brute, decline\n\nTo multiply domestic \"pledges,\"\n\nThe family he rears in hedges\n\nIs often limited to nine.=\n\n\n\nSuch shocking want of _savoir faire_,\n\n(Surely a symptom of insanity)\n\nMight goad a Bishop to profanity\n\nWere it not for the Belgian hare.=\n\n\n\n\nSONG FOR VINTNERS\n\n\n|THE Lion laps the limpid lake,\n\n`The Pard refuses wine,\n\nThe sinuous Lizard and the Snake,\n\n`The petulant Porcupine,\n\nAgree in this, their thirst to quench\n\nOnly with Nature's natural \"drench.\"=\n\n\n\nIn vain with beer you tempt the Deer,\n\n`Or lure the Marmozet;\n\nThe early morning Chanticleer,\n\n`The painted Parroquet,\n\nAlike, on claret and champagne\n\nGaze with unfaltering disdain.=\n\n\n\nNo ale or spirit tempts the Ferret,\n\n`No juice of grape the Toad.\n\nIn vain towards the \"Harp and Merit\"\n\n`The patient Ox you goad;\n\nNot his in rapture to extol\n\nThe praises of the flowing bowl.=\n\n\n\nThe silent Spider laughs at cider,\n\n`The Horse despises port;\n\nThe Crocodile (whose mouth is wider\n\n`Than any other sort)\n\nPrefers the waters of the Nile\n\nTo any of a stronger style.=\n\n\n\nThe Rabbit knows no \"private bar,\"\n\n`The Pelican will wander\n\nThrough arid plains of Kandahar,\n\n`Nor ever pause to ponder\n\nWhether in that infernal clime\n\nThe clocks converge to \"closing time.\"=\n\n\n\nTrue \"bona-fide traveller\"\n\n`Urging no sophist plea,\n\nHow terrible must seem to her\n\n`Man's inebriety;\n\nShe who in thirsty moments places\n\nHer simple trust in green oases.=\n\n\n\nWith what calm scorn the Unicorn,\n\n`In his remote retreat,\n\nMust contemplate the fervour born\n\n`Of old \"Ch\u221a\u00a2teau Lafitte.\"\n\nConceive the feelings of the Sphinx\n\nConfronted with Columbian drinks!=\n\n\n\nAnd oh! if all this solemn truth\n\n`Were dinned into its mind\n\nFrom earliest years, might not our youth\n\n`Regenerate mankind,\n\nAspire to climb the Heights, and dare\n\nTo emulate the Belgian hare?=\n\n\n\n\nHYMN FOR HUMBLE PEOPLE\n\n\n|THE staunch and strenuous Serpent spends his time\n\n`In the safe field of serpentine pursuits,\n\nRightly considering it a social crime\n\n`To parody the ways of other brutes.=\n\n\n\nScorning the fraud of alien aspirations,\n\n`The snobbishness that apes another class,\n\nProud, and yet conscious of his limitations,\n\n`He bites the dust and grovels in the grass.=\n\n\n\nThe moral food that keeps him down is Force,\n\n`Force to confine his fancies to their beds.\n\nMakes him the laughing-stock of quadrupeds.=\n\n\n\nNo weak attempt to carol like the Lark,\n\n`Fore-doomed to failure and to ridicule,\n\nTroubles his life; he does not wish to bark,\n\n`Has no desire to amble like a Mule.=\n\n\n\nHaving no legs he does not try to walk,\n\n`But keeps contentedly his native crawl;\n\nHaving no voice he does not strive to talk,\n\n`Much less to bellow or to caterwaul.=\n\n\n\nMark the inevitably reached result:\n\n`To balance the advantages he missed,\n\nIn three departments he may yet exult\n\n`To be the only perfect specialist.=\n\n\n\nThree arts are his: to writhe, to hiss, to creep.\n\n`The Toad's tenacity, the Wombat's wiles,\n\nOr the keen cunning of the crafty Sheep\n\n`(And all are artists in their various styles),=\n\n\n\nWould vainly challenge them. He reigns supreme\n\n`In these the fields of his activity,\n\nAnd reigning so defies the envious Bream,\n\n`Who sneers and shrugs and sniggers in the sea.=\n\n\n\nType of the wise, who roar but never foam\n\n`(If they can help it) at the mouth, except\n\nWhen night and morn they brush their teeth at home\n\n`With pallid powder for that purpose kept.=\n\n\n\n\nVERSICLES FOR VEGETARIANS\n\n\n|SINCE Dr. Watts in frenzy fine\n\n`Extolled the \"busy Bee,\"\n\nThe patience of the Porcupine,\n\n`The Newt's fidelity,\n\nThe calm contentment of the Pike,\n\nHave stirred our hearts and brain alike.=\n\n\n\nLives there a man so lost, so low,\n\n`That he has never found\n\nSome lesson in the Buffalo,\n\n`Some precept in the Hound?\n\nFew who have won Victoria's cross\n\nOwe _nothing_ to the Albatross.=\n\n\n\nThese pleasant thoughts must turn our minds,\n\n`In meditation quiet,\n\nTowards the moral law that binds\n\n`The principles of diet.\n\nSince 'tis a maxim none disputes,\n\nThat we should imitate the brutes.=\n\n\n\nAs has been shown in former verse,\n\n`The animal creation\n\nDoes not in its own nature nurse\n\n`Inebriate inclination;\n\nNor is it formed by Heaven to pant\n\nFor alcoholic stimulant.=\n\n\n\nThat being so, our path is plain,\n\n`We must eschew all drinks;\n\nIf we are anxious to attain\n\n`To the celestial brinks,\n\nThe meanest Hippopotamus\n\nWill make our duty clear to us.=\n\n\n\nBut in the search for Natural guides\n\n`To moral food-restrictions,\n\nWe are assaulted on all sides\n\n`By patent contradictions.\n\nThus, while the Lion lives on meat,\n\nThe Pheasant is content with wheat.=\n\n\n\nWho then, when beasts do not agree,\n\n`Shall venture to decide?\n\nSome will adopt the Chimpanzee\n\n`And some the Fox as guide,\n\nOthers the Bear or Antelope,\n\nNature allows the fullest scope.=\n\n\n\n\nHYMN FOR HOWLERS\n\n\n|WHO that has sailed upon the ocean's face,\n\n`Or walked beside the sea along the sand,\n\nHas not felt envy for the piscine race,\n\nComparing its domain, where noise is banned,\n\nTo the infernal racket that takes place\n\nOn land?=\n\n\n\nWhile up above the billows rage and roar\n\nAnd make a most unnecessary noise,\n\nAnd shallow Shrimps, who live too near the shore,\n\nAre harassed by the shouts of girls and boys,\n\nWho find the beach a place convenient for\n\nTheir toys,=\n\n\n\nThe happy members of the Fishy clan\n\nPursue in peace their various pursuits,\n\nAll undisturbed by bell of muffin-man,\n\nOr bellow of purveyor of fresh fruits,\n\nWho at each \"Pub\" his voice republican\n\nRecruits.=\n\n\n\nThe harmless Herring gambols with his young,\n\nAnd heeds but hears not their impulsive play.\n\n(His heart is with their mother who was flung,\n\nKippered to feed a clerk's bank-holiday,\n\nInto the salting-tub and passed unsung\n\nAway.)=\n\n\n\nNow, had this Herring been of human breed,\n\nAnd lived in London or some other town,\n\nFate would have made him _hear_ as well as heed\n\nHis offspring as it gambolled up and down,\n\nMaking a noise that's very hard indeed\n\nTo drown.=\n\n\n\nMoreover, organ-grinders would have ground,\n\nAnd yowls from both \"employed\" and \"unemployed\";\n\nHoarse howls from those who had \"salvation\" found,\n\nAnd bawls from those whose faith had been destroyed,\n\nWould have combined to keep his sense of sound\n\nAnnoyed.=\n\n\n\nWho would not therefore rather be a Whale,\n\nA Hake, a Haddock, or a Mackerel,\n\nThan linger in this sad uncertain vale\n\n(Here where men sit and hear each other yell)?\n\nBetter to go, if other places fail,\n\nTo ------\n\n\n\n\nDIRGE FOR DEFEATED CANDIDATES\n\n\n|THE dreadful Dragon and the Unicorn,\n\n`Accustomed to be treated with respect,\n\n`And much annoyed by present-day neglect,\n\nHave sometimes wished they never had been born,\n\n`At least in any world so \"unselect.\"=\n\n\n\nTheir non-existence being now a \"fact\"\n\n`Accepted by mankind's majority,\n\n`They naturally feel quite \"up a tree.\"\n\nThey don't know what to do to counteract\n\n`These damned delusions of Democracy.=\n\n\n\nAlthough they often walk out in the sun,\n\n`And show themselves in all important streets,\n\n`Although in fact they have their \"regular beats,\"\n\nThey're hardly ever seen by any one,\n\n`And get no notice in the \"daily sheets.\"=\n\n\n\nAlthough as signs they hang on various inns,\n\n`They find themselves irrevocably \"out.\"=\n\n\n\nIn vain they prance and caracole about,\n\nEven the tribute of \"derisive grins\"\n\n`Is now denied them in their final rout.=\n\n\n\nMere non-belief in his existence may\n\n`Seem, to one emptying a festive flagon\n\n`In the interior of the \"Wasp and Wagon,\"\n\nA very trifling matter any way.\n\n`But it is most annoying to the Dragon.=\n\n\n\nThe subject may appear beneath contempt\n\n`To one who holds the world's applause in scorn,\n\n`Preferring in a cloister to adorn\n\n\"Illumined scrolls in heavenly colours dreamt,\"\n\n`But it is galling to the Unicorn.\n\n\n\n\nPOEM FOR THE PROUD\n\n\n|SEEN in the mirror of the poet's dream,\n\n(Exclusively reserved for the \"elect\"),\n\nEach animal supplies us with a theme\n\nFor wondering-admiration and respect.\n\nThus, to those men who truly modest seem\n\nCompare\n\nThe Hare.=\n\n\n\nThe Bee performs all sorts of useful things\n\nWhen she is gathering honey for the hive,\n\nShe fertilises flowers and plants, and brings\n\nFood to keep necessary Drones alive.\n\nUnless annoyed she very seldom stings,\n\nDear me!\n\nThe Bee.=\n\n\n\nThe Dove extols and cherishes his mate,\n\nAnd coos and woos all through the summer day.\n\nH is life is blamelessly immaculate,\n\nAnd though his wings enable him to stray,\n\nHe seldom does. He never comes home late.\n\nBy Jove!\n\nThe Dove.=\n\n\n\nThe Crow displays a splendid scorn of pelf,\n\nBacked by invulnerable self-restraint.\n\nAll specious arts he lays upon the shelf,\n\nAnd, being free from every primal taint,\n\nHe keeps himself entirely to himself.\n\nBravo\n\nThe Crow!=\n\n\n\nThe Stork _compels_ our admiration, he\n\nWill stand for several hours in the same place\n\nAnd on one leg, instead of two (or three),\n\nThus practising economy of space.\n\nA grand example of stability!\n\nOh Lork!\n\nThe Stork.=\n\n\n\nThe self-repressive Cod, on his own beat,\n\nSwims in elaborately-studied curves.\n\nHe keeps below, not wishing to compete\n\nWith surface-swimming fishes, though his nerves\n\nAre sometimes tried by lack of air, and heat.\n\nGood God!\n\nThe Cod.=\n\n\n\n\nSONG FOR SIDLERS\n\n\n|THE Crab walks sideways, not because his build\n\n`Precludes the possibility of walking straight,\n\nAnd not (as some have thought) that he is filled\n\n`With strange and lawless theories on gait;\n\nStill less that he is foolishly self-willed\n\n`And prone to show off or exaggerate.=\n\n\n\nNo serious student of his life and ways\n\n`Will venture to impugn his common sense;\n\nHis tact and moderation win high praise\n\n`Even from those whose faculties are dense\n\nAnd blind to the false issues which they raise\n\n`When they accuse him of malevolence.=\n\n\n\n\"But, ah!\" these shallow hide-bound pedants cry,\n\n`\"If to the Crab all virtues you concede,\n\nIf his intentions are not evil, why\n\n`This sidelong walk,\n\n`These flanking steps that lead\n\nTo no advancement of Humanity,\n\n`No exaltation of the mortal breed?=\n\n\n\n\"Why not go forward as the Sword-fish goes?\n\n`Or move straight backward, like the jibbing Horse\n\nWhy this absurd and pitiable pose\n\n`That takes delight in any devious course?\n\nWhy this dislike to 'following the nose'\n\n`Which all the best authorities endorse?\"=\n\n\n\nInsensate fools. Swims not the Cod in curves?\n\n`Does not the running Roebuck leap and bound\n\nIf in his flight the Capercailzie swerves,\n\n`Shall he be mocked by every Basset-hound\n\nWho, having neither feathers, wings, nor nerves,\n\n`Has not the pluck to rise up from the ground?=\n\n\n\nPeace, peace, the Crab adopts a side-long walk,\n\n`For reasons still impossible to see.\n\nAnd if his pride permitted him to talk\n\n`To any one who did not do as he,\n\nHis instinct would be, probably, to balk\n\n`The hopes of vulgar curiosity.=\n\n\n\nAnd while the schoolmen argue and discuss,\n\n`And fill the air with \"whats,\" and \"whens,\" and \"whys,\"\n\nAnd demonstrate as: thus, and thus, and thus,\n\n`The crab will pulverise their theories,\n\nAnd put an end to all this foolish fuss\n\n`By walking sideways into Paradise.\n\n\n\n\nFRAGMENT FOR PHILOSOPHERS\n\n\n|IN the abysses of the ocean deeps,\n\n`Fathoms removed from men and mortal strife,\n\nThe unexpectant Oyster smiles and sleeps\n\n`Through the calm cycle of his peaceful life.=\n\n\n\nWhat though above his head the steamboat plies,\n\n`And close at hand he hears the fume and fuss\n\nOf the impetuous Halibut that flies\n\n`The mad embraces of the Octopus.=\n\n\n\nThough the fierce tails of Whales like flails descend\n\n`Upon the water lashed to furious foam,\n\nAnd the Sea-serpents writhe and twist and bend\n\n`All round the purlieus of his ocean home,=\n\n\n\nHe still preserves his philosophic calm,\n\n`His high detachment from material things,\n\nAnd lays to his untroubled soul the balm\n\n`Of that contentment oft denied to kings.=\n\n\n\nNot far off, on the shore, men fume and fret,\n\n`And prowl and howl and postulate and preach,\n\nThe Baby bellows in the bassinet,\n\n`And the Salvation Army on the beach.=\n\n\n\nThe unsuccessful \"Artist\" of the \"Halls\"\n\n`Has blacked his face with cork, and now he sings\n\nOf moons and coons and comic funerals\n\n`And the enchantment that the cake-walk brings.=\n\n\n\nAnd on the pier the \"milingtary band\"\n\n`Poisons the air with beastly brazen sound,\n\nWhile cockney couples wander hand in hand,\n\n`And dismal tourists tour,\n\nAnd bounders bound.=\n\n\n\nAnd donkey-boys allure to donkey rides\n\n`The sitters on the sand beside the sea,\n\nAnd touts sell \"guides\" to all the town provides,\n\n`From theatres to \"painless dentistry.\"=\n\n\n\nTo all this noise the Oyster lends no ear,\n\n`Partly because he has no ear to lend,\n\nPartly because he hates to interfere,\n\n`Chiefly because these rhymes must have an end.=\n\n",
