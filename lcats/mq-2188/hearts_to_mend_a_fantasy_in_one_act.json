It has the diminutive look of a toy\n  house, and the immaculate spick-and-spanness. There are copper\n  kettles and pots on shelves and blue and white plates and cups and\n  saucers. There is a crib in the corner, left, with a screen that can\n  be drawn about it. A table is at the right, front, by the side of\n  which sits Pierrot, head in hands, elbows on knees, very gloomy. A\n  door, left, leads to an inner room; a door, right, to the street._\n\n\n\n\nHEARTS TO MEND\n\n\n(_Pierrette is heard singing a lullaby in the next room._)\n\n  Old Mister Moon is sinking to rest--\n    Sleep, kittikins, sleep!\n  The whispery winds have died in the west--\n    Sleep--kittikins--sleep!\n\n(_She comes in, holding a babe in her arms; sings--very softly._)\n\n  Up in the sky are the firefly stars--\n    Sleep, kittikins, sleep!\n  Father will catch them in crystal jars--\n    Sleep--kittikins--sleep!\n\n(_She lays the babe in its crib, the while softly humming the tune.\nThen she draws the screen about the bed. Meantime she casts anxious\nglances at the moody Pierrot. The babe asleep, she runs to Pierrot,\nkneeling at his side._)\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nTired, sweetheart?\n\nPIERROT (_indifferently_)\n\nOh--I guess so.\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nAnd famished, isn\u2019t that it?\n\n  Kettle not boiling,\n    And table unset;\n  And hungry man waiting\n    For slow Pierrette!\n\nIt\u2019ll all be on the table, dear, in just the littlest minute.\n\nPIERROT\n\nOh, it\u2019s not supper.\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nNot supper?\n\nPIERROT\n\nNo.\n\nPIERRETTE (_solicitously_)\n\nYou haven\u2019t caught cold, Pierrot? You know I told you to wear your\nwoolen muffler and put on your rain shoes. For a man of your superior\nintelligence, you are _so_ careless!\n\nPIERROT\n\n(_getting up with irritation and walking away_)\n\nOh, let me alone, Pierrette! You wouldn\u2019t understand. Get some supper\nfor yourself. I don\u2019t want any.\n\n(_She looks at him troubled for a moment. Then she runs to him, puts\nher hands on his breast._)\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nPierrot.\n\nPIERROT\n\nWell?\n\nPIERRETTE\n\n(_pointing an accusing finger at him slowly_)\n\nYou--haven\u2019t--been--to--see--your--bank--account--again?\n\n(_Pierrot shakes his head gloomily._)\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nOh yes you have! Don\u2019t deny it! And worrying yourself to death about\nexpenses. But Pierrot--things aren\u2019t nearly as bad as you think they\nare. I\u2019m doing all my own work--even the washing and the ironing--and\nPierrot!--I\u2019ve got a scheme! We\u2019ll take a boarder!\n\nPIERROT (_disgusted_)\n\nBoarder! Ugh!\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nWhy not, sweetheart? Of course, we\u2019d have to talk to him at mealtimes,\nI suppose. And you couldn\u2019t kiss me across the table as you used to....\n(_Suddenly, with a catch_) Do you know, Pierrot, you haven\u2019t kissed me\nacross the table for--oh--ever so long!\n\nPIERROT (_struggling with himself_)\n\nPierrette....\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nYes, dear.\n\nPIERROT (_trying to get it out--then in despair_)\n\nOh, what\u2019s the use. I can\u2019t tell it to you.\n\nPIERRETTE (_troubled_)\n\nWhy, what is it, Pierrot? You\u2019ve lost something?\n\nPIERROT (_quickly_)\n\nYes--that\u2019s it. I\u2019ve lost something--the only thing I had,\nPierrette--my song!\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nAh, the silly people didn\u2019t laugh to-day--that\u2019s it?\n\n  Silly, silly people,\n  Staring at a steeple;--\n\nAnd you\u2019re all in the dumps, Pierrot? Isn\u2019t that the trouble?\n\nPIERROT\n\nThey didn\u2019t laugh to-day, Pierrette; and they didn\u2019t laugh yesterday.\nThey haven\u2019t laughed for a long time--not as they used to. (_Most\ngloomily_) And three of my songs have come back from the editors!\n\nPIERRETTE (_defending him_)\n\nBut who cares for editors, Pierrot? They\u2019re such stupid creatures! Some\nday you\u2019ll write a great song that everybody\u2019ll love; and then you\u2019ll\nsee all the foolish little editors bringing you velvets and gold.\n\nPIERROT (_in gloom_)\n\nNo. The editors are right. The people are right. Something\u2019s gone out\nof me. I\u2019m not the same as I was before--before--How long have we been\nmarried, Pierrette?\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nJust three tiny years!\n\nPIERROT (_sighing_)\n\nOnly three years! (_Then bitterly--to Pierrette_) Here!--I\u2019ll give you\na sign. Look! (_He walks with flat, listless feet up and down the room;\nthen speaks, with a hopeless sob in his voice_) I no longer walk on my\ntoes! See! Flat--like that! No songs ever walked that way! Songs?\nNo--here\u2019s the way--\n\n(_He rises momentarily to his toes and sings._)\n\n  Oh, a merry, merry fellow,\n  And a sweet, fair maid,\n  Danced on the meadow in the gypsy time--\n  Said the merry, merry fellow\n  To the sweet, fair maid--\n\n(_He breaks off._)\n\nPIERROT (_hopeless_)\n\nNo--I can\u2019t do it. It\u2019s gone out of me. (_Desperately_) Pierrette--I\u2019ve\ncome to a conclusion. I ought never to have married!\n\nPIERRETTE (_suddenly stabbed_)\n\nOh, Pierrot, it\u2019s been the most beautiful thing in all the world!\n\nPIERROT\n\nThat\u2019s because you\u2019re a woman, Pierrette, and not an artist.\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nBut _you_ said it was the most beautiful thing in all the world,\nPierrot.\n\nPIERROT (_vaguely_)\n\nDid I? That was long ago. You don\u2019t understand, Pierrette. Women never\ndo. Life to them is a little cage in which they sit all day long and\nsing tiny songs about tea and muffins. Men are different. Put them in a\ncage and they sing for a day. Then they begin to droop.\n\nPIERRETTE (_hurt_)\n\nSo you want to go away, Pierrot?\n\nPIERROT (_passionately_)\n\nI want to capture it again--the power, the thrill, the fire of song!\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nAnd you would capture it if--if I--(_looking toward the screen which\nhides the crib_) if we--were not here?\n\nPIERROT (_flinging out his arms in despair_)\n\nOh, I\u2019m a brute, Pierrette! I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m gone stale--that\u2019s the\ntrouble. I\u2019m done for--all these worries and things. I\u2019ll sit at home,\nI guess, and darn socks!\n\n(_He flings himself into his chair. Pierrette moves quietly about,\nputting his tea on the table. She sets tea only for one._)\n\nPIERRETTE (_handing him his cup_)\n\nThere, sweetheart. Your tea.\n\nPIERROT (_stirring himself_)\n\nAren\u2019t you going to have some, too?\n\nPIERRETTE (_controlling her voice and with her back half turned to\nhim as she goes to the other room_)\n\nOh no, dear; I\u2019ve had lots of tea this afternoon. I\u2019m not hungry.\nBesides, I\u2019m late with the cleaning up. I\u2019ll be gone only a minute.\n\n(_She goes out quickly. Pierrot makes to rise and follow her; then,\nwith a hopeless wave of the hand, sinks back into the chair. He drinks\nhis tea moodily. There is a voice outside_)--\n\n  \u201cTins to mend! Tins to mend!\u201d\n\n(_A knock at the door and the Tins-to-mend man enters._)\n\nMAN (_taking off his cap, half humorously, half apologetically_)\n\nAny tins to mend, sir?\n\nPIERROT (_grimly_)\n\nNothing as easy as that in this house. It\u2019s hearts to mend here!\n\nMAN (_slinging off his pack_)\n\nHearts to mend?--oho--I do that, too! Truth is (_confidentially_), it\u2019s\ncome to be my main business. For if you\u2019d believe it, there\u2019s more\nhearts to mend and souls to mend than pots and kettles to mend in this\nold world of ours. Fact, my dear sir, fact! (_Sits down_) And you can\u2019t\nthrow hearts away when they begin to show wear--now can you?--like you\nthrow away an old pot? No siree! (_Impressively_) You got to mend \u2019em.\nAnd there\u2019s tricks about mendin\u2019 them, sir--tricks in all trades, say\nI. You can mend \u2019em so\u2019s they\u2019s worse\u2019n they was in the beginning.\nAnd you can mend \u2019em so careful and so clever, you can\u2019t tell they\nwas ever mended at all. In fact, I\u2019ve mended some of them so they was\nbetter that way than they was in the beginning. Seems curious, but it\u2019s\ntrue. If there was a kettle now you wanted me to work on while I was\ntalkin\u2019, it\u2019d keep me busy.\n\n(_Pierrot looks about; gets up and tosses him a kettle._)\n\nPIERROT\n\nThere! Bang away at that!\n\n(_He sits down again. The Tins-to-mend man hammers away for awhile,\nPierrot watching him gloomily._)\n\nMAN\n\nYou see--pots and kettles is curious things. Y\u2019 can\u2019t just let \u2019em set\nthere and be. They rust. That\u2019s what they do. Y\u2019 got t\u2019 keep shinin\u2019\n\u2019em--keep polishin\u2019 \u2019em up. And they like it, sir--oh, they do! They\nkinda get a hold on life. And when they hang in your kitchen all bright\nand happy like, they just seem to sing away like birds. Now you\u2019re a\nsinger, sir--why don\u2019t you make a song about that?\n\nPIERROT\n\nI can\u2019t sing any more.\n\nMAN\n\nLost your voice, sir?\n\nPIERROT\n\nNo--worse than that--I\u2019m married!\n\nMAN (_solicitously_)\n\nThat\u2019s bad, sir; that\u2019s bad--if you\u2019re not married right. They take it\nout of a man, them wicked ones!\n\nPIERROT (_firing up_)\n\nWho said she was a wicked one?\n\nMAN\n\nBut if she\u2019s good--\n\nPIERROT (_hopelessly_)\n\nAh, that\u2019s the trouble. She\u2019s good. A man can\u2019t live on goodness alone.\nIt gets on his nerves.\n\nMAN\n\nAnd what else should he live on?\n\nPIERROT (_passionately_)\n\nThrills--passions--longings! The kisses that make dreams--the touches\nof hands that make the songs come tumbling out of you--\n\nMAN (_laughing_)\n\nOho, but it ought to be easy enough for a handsome young master like\nyou to get those things!\n\nPIERROT\n\nIt\u2019d break her heart.\n\nMAN (_lifting his eyes_)\n\nThen you\u2019re fond of her, sir?\n\nPIERROT (_roughly_)\n\nOf course I\u2019m fond of her. That\u2019s just the trouble! (_pause_) But\nI\u2019m tired to death of her--and that\u2019s the trouble, too. First, when\nI loved her, just a peep of her out of a window would set my heart\ndancing. Now, when I see her--it\u2019s just like seeing--the butcher\nboy--or the bakeshop woman. (_Rises excitedly_) I tell you when things\nare like that, something\u2019s got to be done. An artist can\u2019t live\nthat way. Ordinary men can. All they want of their wives is to be\ncushions--soft--so\u2019s they can go to sleep. Artists are different. They\nwant the sky and all the quivering stars in the sky. When they marry\n(_he makes a grimace_)--it\u2019s good-bye to the stars!\n\nMAN (_looking at him quizzically_)\n\nDid you ever think, sir, why the night was made--with them stars you\ntalk of?\n\nPIERROT\n\nWhy was the night made?\n\nMAN\n\nOr why there\u2019s settin\u2019 o\u2019 the sun and risin\u2019 o\u2019 the sun?\n\nPIERROT\n\nWhy is there setting of the sun and rising of the sun?\n\nMAN\n\nWell--I don\u2019t exactly know myself. But I seem to figger it out this\nway. Think of what it\u2019d be, I says to myself, if there was all just\none long day. Always day and day and day. Always the same glary light\nstarin\u2019 y\u2019 in the eye--borin\u2019 into your brain--so\u2019s y\u2019 couldn\u2019t shut it\nout from y\u2019; so\u2019s y\u2019 couldn\u2019t get away from it; so\u2019s y\u2019 couldn\u2019t watch\nthe shadders come stealin\u2019 along, the sun a-settin\u2019 and the twinklin\u2019\nstars a-comin\u2019 out--and so\u2019s y\u2019 couldn\u2019t stretch yourself out and\nsleep--and so\u2019s y\u2019 couldn\u2019t all of a sudden wake and hear the birds\nchirpin\u2019 and a new day come! Ah, it\u2019s that, sir--it\u2019s the comin\u2019 of the\nnew day that makes life the grand thing it is--the comin\u2019 of the new\nday _every_ day!\n\nPIERROT (_wonderingly_)\n\nThe coming of the new day every day?\n\nMAN\n\nJust that. It\u2019s a grand plan, sir! Keeps the world young. You try it.\n\nPIERROT\n\nTry it? What do you mean? I\u2019m not the sun.\n\nMAN\n\nAh, but you can be--and starlight and moonlight! How long was it--now\ntell me--since the thought came to you in the morning--I\u2019ll bring\nher--I\u2019ll bring her a vi\u2019let? Oho--I know--(_sings_)\n\n  Sweet was the honeymoon,\n    Swift it passed away--\n  Now we\u2019re steady married folk--\n    Day after day.\n\nIt\u2019s only for a short time--in the beginning--that every day\u2019s a new\nday. After that it\u2019s just always the same--always the same--and no\nrisin\u2019 o\u2019 the sun in the mornin\u2019--no chirp of birds--and no singin\u2019 in\nthe heart.\n\nPIERROT\n\nYou mean--\n\nMAN (_roguishly, bending to his task_)\n\nI mean there\u2019s a good way to mend kettles and a bad way, sir; and when\nthe kettles are singin\u2019 and the fires are burnin\u2019 under them--Oho--but\nthere\u2019s more hearts than kettles!\n\n(_Pierrot stands thinking._)\n\nPIERROT (_to himself_)\n\nI used to bring her things--a little red cloak I once brought her. Oh,\nshe was happy! I remember that day. I made a song about it.\n\nMAN (_hammering away--sings_)\n\n  Tins to mend,\n  And hearts to tend;\n  Hearts and tins\n  Have outs and ins!\n\nPIERROT (_continuing--to himself_)\n\nIt was one of my very best songs. And she was so happy! (_Suddenly_)\nWhy--I\u2019ve forgotten all about her lately! Even her birthday! She had to\nremind me of it! Poor Pierrette!\n\nMAN (_sings_)\n\n  Outs and ins;\n  Outs and ins;\n  That\u2019s where the trouble\n  Of life begins!\n\n(_Pierrot looks up. His eyes suddenly grow bright with an idea._)\n\nPIERROT (_rising to his toes--running to the Tins-to-Mend Man_)\n\nI have it, old fellow--I have it! There\u2019s a shop--just a step away. I\nknow something she wants there. I\u2019m going to get it for her!\n\n  My purse it is lean;\n    My purse it is lank;\n  But who cares a flip\n    For the state of my bank!\n\n(_He dances delighted._)\n\nCome--are you finished? I\u2019ve got to hurry. She\u2019s gone off into that\nroom to clear up. She\u2019ll be coming back any minute.\n\nMAN (_looking up smiling--handing him the kettle_)\n\nIt\u2019s mended. Better than it ever was!\n\n(_Pierrot takes the kettle--runs to the shelf and puts it away. To the\nMan--_\n\nPIERROT\n\nCome now, come!\n\nMAN (_gathering up pack_)\n\nI\u2019m coming. (_Sings_)--\n\n  Life\u2019s a joy\n    When turned about;\n  In to in\n    And out to out.\n\nPIERROT (_putting on cloak_)\n\nIf I hurry now, I\u2019ll have it here before she\u2019s through with her work;\nit\u2019s a beauty--it\u2019s a beauty (_dances exultant_).\n\n  My pockets are slimpsy as pockets can be;\n  And short is the space twixt the poorhouse and me;\n  But while there\u2019s a copper that hasn\u2019t been spent,\n  I\u2019ll mortgage my shoes for the price of the rent!\n\n(_They both make their exit as Pierrot sings._)\n\n_After a moment, Pierrette opens the inner door softly, and seeing that\nno one is there, steps in. She has on a cloak and a hood over her head.\nShe is very sad._\n\n_She first takes the tea things from the table. Then, hesitating, she\ngoes to the screen, pulling it softly aside. She leans over the crib\nfor a merest moment. Then she pulls the screen to again, whispering:_\n\n  Up in the sky are the firefly stars;\n    Sleep, Kittikins, sleep!\n  Father will catch them in crystal jars--\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nYes, Kittikins, we must let father. Father can make such beautiful\nsongs. We must not stand in his way, Kittikins--we love him so.\n\n(_She goes to the shelf and gets down a sheet of paper, the ink horn\nand a quill pen--takes them to the table, sits and writes._)\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nWe\u2019ll just write this: \u201cMother Merle--will--take--Kittikins.--She--\nloves--her.--Good-bye--Sweetheart.\u201d We\u2019ll leave it here.\n\n(_She folds it and lays it on the table. She half goes once more to the\ncrib; but she controls herself. Then, as she goes to the door, she half\nturns, looks at Pierrot\u2019s chair, and sings softly_)--\n\n  Love comes in, a-tip-toe, laughing;\n    Love trails out with leaden feet--\n  Love that\u2019s here to-day may leave us,\n    Banished in a windy street.\n\n  I shall love you always, always--\n    Sweetheart, through the endless years;\n  I shall love you with my heartaches;\n    I shall love you with my tears.\n\n(_She goes out into the night._)\n\n(_After a time Pierrot comes hurrying in. His eyes are dancing. His\ntoes are dancing. He peeks about to see if she is there. Then he makes\nto hide his package under the stool, but thinks better of it. He runs\nto the screen, but again decides against the place. He looks about and\nconsiders. An idea strikes him and he takes off his peaked hat and\ndrops the package into that. But again he decides against it. At last,\nwith a sudden inspiration, he runs to the pewter pot._)\n\nPIERROT (_gleeful_)\n\nShe\u2019ll use that to-night when she warms Kittikins\u2019 milk. A great idea!\nOh, she\u2019ll be surprised! And I\u2019ll just pretend I know nothing about it!\nI\u2019ll be reading in my book--or writing--making faces at my paper--and\nI\u2019ll see her out of the corner of my eye--\n\n  Hi, hi--\n    Pierrette, hot!--\n  Peep behind\n    The pewter pot!\n\nShe\u2019ll take the pot away. She\u2019ll find the package! She\u2019ll open it! Then\nshe\u2019ll just go all red and white--I can see her in my mind\u2019s eye--and\nshe\u2019ll run over to me--\n\n(_He sees the paper on the table; reads it._)\n\nPIERROT\n\nPierrette! (_He runs to the door of the inner room_) Pierrette! (_He\nruns to the street door_) Pierrette! (_Then he runs back for his hat;\nbut just as he makes to follow her, the meaning of it comes over\nhim. He drops his hat. He goes slowly to the table, dropping into\nhis chair_) It\u2019s right. It\u2019s what ought to be. She was a wisp of\nsunlight--a night of stars--she was birds singing and summer winds. She\nwas Pierrette!--(_With a sob_) And I drove her away!\n\n(_He sinks into the chair, his head on his arms. There is a pause. The\ndoor opens softly. Pierrette peeps in. Seeing Pierrot all crumpled up,\nshe tiptoes toward him a few steps, stretching out her arms yearningly.\nBut she controls herself, tiptoes a few steps towards the crib, blows\na kiss to the baby and turns to go out again. Pierrot lifts his head\nsuddenly, sees her and jumps up. Pierrette tries to escape him._)\n\nPIERROT (_catching her in his arms_)\n\nPierrette!\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nOh, Pierrot, I just came back for the littlest look. I couldn\u2019t help\nit. I\u2019ll go now.\n\nPIERROT\n\nBut Pierrette, look! _(He dances about)_ It\u2019s all come back again! I\u2019ve\ngot a new song singing in me, Pierrette! It\u2019s the best song yet. It\u2019ll\nmake me famous!\n\n  The editors will flock to me,\n    Exactly as you said--\n  A-bringing gold and velvets\n    And a-swelling of my head!\n\n(_He tries to take her cloak off._)\n\nPIERROT (_coaxingly_)\n\nPierrette, please stay!\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nNo, no--it was _because_ I went away, don\u2019t you see? That\u2019s how you\nfound your song. You\u2019re right, Pierrot--wives _ought_ to go away.\n\nPIERROT\n\nBut they ought to come back again, too, Pierrette!\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nOnly for a tiny look, Pierrot. They\u2019d like--oh yes, they\u2019d like to\nstay. But if they\u2019re wise--ah no--Good-bye!\n\n(_She starts to go. Pierrot runs after her._)\n\nPIERROT\n\nPierrette--if you _must_ go--wait--(_mysteriously_)--there\u2019s something\nhere for you.\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nSomething for me?\n\nPIERROT\n\nSomething for you.\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nWhere is it?\n\nPIERROT (_teasingly_)\n\n  Perhaps it\u2019s on the ceiling,\n    Perhaps it\u2019s on the floor;\n  Perhaps it\u2019s gone to visit the moon,\n    And won\u2019t be back till four!\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nOh, Pierrot, don\u2019t tease! Where is it?\n\nPIERROT (_more teasingly_)\n\nGuess!\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nIs it--is it--behind the screen?\n\nPIERROT\n\nGuess again.\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nIs it--is it--under the clock?\n\nPIERROT\n\nGuess again.\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nIs it--is it--under your hat?\n\nPIERROT\n\nGuess again.\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nIs it--is it--ah--I know where it is. It\u2019s behind the pewter pot!\n\nPIERROT\n\nRight!\n\n(_She runs up and gets the package, opens it and discovers a necklace\nof gay, red beads._)\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nWhy--Pierrot--for me?\n\nPIERROT (_making believe to consider_)\n\nWell, that depends. I thought it was for you. But if you\u2019re going\naway--\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nBut why did you get it for me?\n\nPIERROT\n\nDo you want to know, sweetheart?\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nYes.\n\nPierrot (_dances_)\n\n  Old Mister Pierrot\n    Went to a shop;\n  Then he came back again--\n    Hop--skip--hop!\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nBut that isn\u2019t the _reason_, Pierrot. Be sensible.\n\nPIERROT (_continues_)\n\n  Old Mister Pierrot\n    Was blue, blue, blue--\n  Along came a tinker-man\n    And showed him what to do!\n\nPIERROT\n\nPierrette, I\u2019ve come to a conclusion!\n\nPIERRETTE (_apprehensively_)\n\nNot another conclusion, Pierrot?\n\nPIERROT\n\nYes. I\u2019m great on conclusions. It\u2019s this: that most husbands, with\nadorable wives, are donkeys!\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nOh, but I knew that long ago--ever since I married you.\n\nPIERROT\n\nYou knew it all that time?\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nOf course.\n\nPIERROT\n\nThen how were you able to put up with me?\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nOh, I knew you\u2019d discover it some day; and when you did discover it,\nyou\u2019d be such a _nice_ donkey. Pierrot, I\u2019ve come to a conclusion\nmyself!\n\nPIERROT (_apprehensively_)\n\nYou, too, Pierrette? What is it?\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nThat most wives, with clever husbands, are silly geese!\n\nPIERROT (_heartily_)\n\nWhy, I\u2019ve known that, Pierrette, ever since I married _you_. I didn\u2019t\nthink I ought to tell you, though.\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nAnd I don\u2019t blame you, Pierrot--not for a minute--for wanting me to go\naway.\n\nPIERROT (_fervently_)\n\nI want you back, now!\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nBut I _am_ going away, Pierrot!\n\nPIERROT\n\nPierrette!\n\nPIERRETTE\n\nNot now, Pierrot--but some time!\n\n(_As the curtain falls, they bend quickly toward each other, their\nhands stretched out behind, and kiss._)\n\n\n\n\nFour Plays of the Free Theater:\n\n\n  \u201cThe Fossils,\u201d \u201cThe Serenade,\u201d \u201cFrancoise\u2019 Luck,\u201d \u201cThe Dupe.\u201d\n\nAuthorized Translation with Introduction by BARRETT H.

This monumental anthology brings\ntogether for the first time the epoch-making theories and criticisms\nof the drama which have affected our civilization from the beginnings\nin Greece down to the present day. Beginning with Aristotle, each\nutterance on the subject has been chosen with reference to its\nimportance, and its effect on subsequent dramatic writing. The texts\nalone would be of great interest and value, but the author, Barrett H.\nClark, has so connected each period by means of inter-chapters that his\ncomments taken as a whole constitute a veritable history of dramatic\ncriticism, in which each text bears out his statements.\n\nNowhere else is so important a body of doctrine on the subject of\nthe drama to be obtained. It cannot fail to appeal to anyone who is\ninterested in the theater, and will be indispensable to students.\n\nThe introduction to each section of the book is followed by an\nexhaustive bibliography; each writer whose work is represented is made\nthe subject of a brief biography, and the entire volume is rendered\ndoubly valuable by the index, which is worked out in great detail.\n\n_Prof. Brander Matthews_, of Columbia University, says: \u201cMr. Clark\ndeserves high praise for the careful thoroughness with which he has\nperformed the task he set for himself. He has done well what was\nwell worth doing. In these five hundred pages he has extracted the\nessence of several five-foot shelves. His anthology will be invaluable\nto all students of the principles of playmaking; and it ought to be\nwelcomed by all those whose curiosity has been aroused by the frequent\nreferences of our latter-day theorists of the theater to their\npredecessors Aristotle and Horace, Castelvetro and Scaliger, Sidney\nand Jonson, d\u2019Aubignac and Boileau, Lessing and Schlegel, Goethe and\nColeridge.\u201d\n\n_Wm. Lyon Phelps_, of Yale University, writes: \u201cMr. Clark\u2019s book,\n\u2018European Theories of the Drama,\u2019 is an exceedingly valuable work and\nought to be widely useful.\u201d\n\n_Large 8vo, 500 pages.
