    "body": "She came off the Androids, Inc., production line in September, 2241.\nShe was five feet, seven inches tall, weighed 135 pounds, had flaxen\nhair and pale blue eyes. Her built-in batteries were guaranteed for\nten years, her tapes were authentic Kirsten Flagstad, and her name was\nIsolde.\n\n\n\nShe was shipped to New York via strato-freight, and late in October\nshe opened the season at the Metropolitanette in what the hundred or\nso die-hard enthusiasts still holding the Wagnerian fort, called the\nbest Tristan ever. Afterwards, she was deactivated and stored away,\nalong with Tristan, Brangane, Melot, King Marke, Kurvenal, the shepherd\nand the helmsman, and the various knights, soldiers, attendants, and\nsailors that constituted the rest of the dramatis personae.\n\nAt that time the black market in androids was relatively new, and only\nstandard measures were taken to guard the Metropolitanette storeroom.\nOperatic androids were not exactly the kind of merchandise the average\ntwenty-third century citizen liked most to find underneath his\nChristmas tree, and to a Wagnerian aficionado, the idea of the average\nmusic lover stealing one was as preposterous as the idea of a twentieth\ncentury bobby soxer stealing a Caruso original. But an operatic\nandroid was potentially capable of doing other things besides singing\nrecitative and arias--as a number of twenty-third century operators had\nbegun to realize some time before the beginning of this history. Hans\nBecker was one of them.\n\nYou've seen Hans. You've seen him in bars and on airbusses, in waiting\nrooms and in automats. He likes to sit in secluded corners and study\npeople through his cigar smoke. He has a penchant for ostentatious\nblondes and dirty comic films. He has a passion for the quick credit.\n\nYou see him now. He is talking to a mousy little man in a decrepit bar\noff Fifth Avenue. The little man nods every now and then, smiles a\nsatisfied smile every time Hans sets him up a beer. The little man is a\nnight watchman. He is a night watchman in the very building where the\nMetropolitanette stores its deactivated androids. He is in his fifties,\nand he too likes ostentatious blondes. But on a night watchman's pay,\nthe only ones he can afford are a little too ostentatious even for\nhim. He would like them to be a little less ostentatious, and, if\npossible, a little younger. He smiles, nods his head again. He drinks\nthe fresh beer the bartender sets before him. He licks the froth from\nhis lips with the tip of his gray tongue. He pockets the sheaf of\ncredits which Hans slips him. He nods again. \"Tomorrow night, then,\" he\nsays. \"At the backdoor. I'll have her ready for you.\"\n\n\n\nIsolde's first stop, after her abduction, was at the house of a\nconverter Hans knew. The converter's name was Wisprey, and he was an\nartist in his own right. By the time he finished with Isolde, you never\nwould have dreamed--unless you were a Wagnerian devotee--that once\nupon a time she had been a bona fide reproduction of an Irish heroine\nin a German opera. You would have sworn, instead, that she was a\nSwedish-type maid of the kind Androids, Inc., specialized in, and which\nretailed for 2500 credits. Her flaxen hair had been drawn back into\na little chignon, her period costume had been exchanged for a modern\nservant's outfit, and her classic features had been subtly altered to\nsuggest sycophancy. As though that were not enough, she could scrub\nfloors, wash dishes, cook, and darn socks.\n\nThe only part of her the converter did not alter was the sealed-in unit\ncontaining her voice tapes. That, he told Hans, would have involved\ntoo intricate an operation. Besides, who cared if she sang instead of\ntalked, anyway, as long as she could work?\n\n\"That's right,\" Hans said. \"Who cares? When they see how strong she is,\nthey'll buy her like sixty.\"\n\n\"Sure they will.\"\n\n\"And she's only the first. There's lots of other big ones where she\ncame from and I'm going to grab them off, too.\"\n\nHe didn't grab them off, though. A week later, he fell into his blonde\nmistress' barbecue pit and was so drunk he couldn't get back out before\nhe was barbecued to the bone. Before this lamentable occurrence,\nhowever, he sold his pilfered princess to an interstellar trader, and\nthereby launched Isolde upon her odyssey.\n\nThe interstellar trader, whose name was Higgens, owned a Class B\nmerchant ship of the old photon-ejection variety. He stored Isolde in\nthe after-hold and left her there till his fourth planetfall--Sirius\n21. Then he got her out, dusted her off, combed her hair and activated\nher. He led her down the gangplank and stood her on the collapsible\nauctioneer's block he'd set up at the ship's base. There were a number\nof colonists gathered around the block already, but he saved her till\nlast, auctioning off the rest of his payload first. By the time he took\nher hand and led her to the center of the block, word of her presence\nhad got around the nearby colony, and there was a near-maximum turnout.\n\n\"All right,\" Higgens said. \"She's beautiful and she's strong and she's\nsturdy. I don't need to tell you those things because you can see them\nfor yourself. I'm merely reminding you of them. But what you can't see\nare the things she can do. So here's the way we'll work it: you name\nsomething you'd like a servant of yours to be able to do, and I'll tell\nyou whether she can do it or not. Who's first?\"\n\n\"Can she cook?\" a thin-faced woman wanted to know.\n\n\"I knew you'd ask that one first. The answer is yes. Next?\"\n\n\"Can she milk a milch bront?\" This time the asker was a middle-aged\ncolonist of Dutch descent.\n\nHiggens consulted a small notebook. \"She can--if a milch bront is\nenough like a cow,\" he said presently.\n\nThere was the inevitable drunk in the crowd. \"Can she keep a man's bed\nwarm?\"\n\nHiggens played along. \"She sure can, buddy, but you know the law as\nwell as I do.\"\n\n\"Can she scrub floors, lift, carry, wash clothes, do dishes and wait on\npeople?\" It was the Dutch colonist again.\n\nHiggens nodded. \"Seems to me you've just about covered everything,\nfriend. Want to make the first bid?\"\n\n\"200 credits,\" the Dutch colonist said.\n\n\"I have 200 credits,\" Higgens intoned, \"which, if I do say so, is about\none tenth of what she's worth. Do I hear three?\"\n\n\"300,\" the drunk said.\n\n\"350,\" the Dutch colonist said.\n\n\"450.\"\n\nThe Dutch colonist could outbid anybody in the crowd, and everybody in\nthe crowd knew it, including the drunk. But the drunk didn't give a\ndamn, and he went along to the one thousand mark before dropping out.\nThe Dutch colonist got her for 1100 credits, and the first stage of\nIsolde's servitude began.\n\nThe Dutch colonist's name was Vanderzee. You've seen him, too. Forget\nabout his race: his race has nothing to do with it. All races have\ntheir Vanderzees. This one was a bachelor, and made a prosperous living\nbuying seconds in large lots and selling them for firsts. The business\nhe happened to be in was the clothing business, but no matter what\nbusiness he had been in, he would have conducted it in the same way.\nThere were Vanderzees in the time of Gautama Siddhartha; there were\nVanderzees in the time of Christ; there were Vanderzees in the time of\nFDR. There will always be Vanderzees.\n\nThis one took his purchase home in a ground skimmer. He looked at her\nsideways as they skimmed along, a little awed by her classic features,\nwhich even the converter's skill had been unable to destroy altogether.\nBy the time they reached the apartment above his store, the first\ndroppings of his sense of inferiority had already fertilized the\nground where his latent hatred lay, and when he asked her a simple\nquestion, the hatred burst forth in twisted stems and ugly blossoms.\nFor, instead of answering the question with the simple \"yes sir\" or \"no\nsir\" which was all it required, Isolde responded with the particular\nrecitative it most closely provoked, and the windows rattled in the\nmajestic blast from her Kirsten Flagstad tapes. Vanderzee, for all his\nshrewdness, had neglected to make the most obvious inquiry of all from\nHiggens, re his prospective purchase--i.e., _Can she talk?_\n\nBut Vanderzee didn't take her back. For one thing, he knew that Higgens\nhad already closed his lock and would be blasting off any second. For\nanother, taking her back would have been a tacit admission that he had\nbeen outwitted by a business man sharper than himself, and this he\ncould not bear. No, Vanderzee had made a purchase, and he would stick\nwith it: but he would get his money's worth out of it if it took him\nthe rest of his life.\n\nIsolde was put to work with a vengeance. Each dawn she milked the milch\nbront Vanderzee kept in the shed behind his store. Each day she washed\ndishes, cooked, scrubbed floors, waited on customers and unloaded\nsupplies for Vanderzee. Each evening she washed dishes, cooked,\nscrubbed floors, waited on customers and unloaded supplies for Lanesce,\nthe local tavern keeper to whom Vanderzee sublet her for part time\nwork. But in this subsidiary attempt to get all he could out of her,\nand in the getting of it, obtain his revenge on her for having deceived\nhim (by the end of the second week, Vanderzee actually had himself\nbelieving that it was she, and not Higgens, who had put one over on\nhim), Vanderzee made a mistake.\n\nIt was a natural enough mistake. Who would have dreamed that an\nandroid who screamed or sang gibberish (German was a dead language by\n2241 in any but the most esoteric sense, and Vanderzee was generations\nremoved from his native tongue) could attain to any degree of\npopularity whatsoever in any kind of an establishment whatsoever. But\ntaverns are not ordinary establishments, and frequently events come\nto pass in them that could never have come to pass elsewhere. Isolde\nbecame popular. She became so popular, in fact, that Lanesce's business\ndoubled. Tripled.\n\n\n\nThere was nothing unprecedented about her popularity. Idiot waitresses\nhave always enjoyed an exalted place in taverns. They make ideal\npatsies for jokes, for one thing, and are generally responsive to\ngooses, for another. While Isolde was neither an idiot nor responsive\nto gooses, the sounds she uttered whenever anyone said something to\nher, obscene or otherwise, were suggestive enough of idiot rantings to\nthe ear of the average patron, for her to be classified as an idiot;\nand while she may not have been responsive to gooses, neither was she\non her guard against them, taking them in her stride like everything\nelse. None of which bears directly on the nature of Vanderzee's\nmistake. What does bear directly upon it is the fact that the variety\nof men who frequent bars, is infinite. Sooner or later someone had to\ncome along who would recognize Isolde, either from her recitative or\nfrom her arias, or from her appearance, for what she was--or what she\nonce had been. And presently someone did.\n\n\n\nEnter, Elwood Parkhurst. You've seen him, too. In bars, mostly.\nBut before he took exclusively to bars, you may have seen him in\n_avantgarde_ ghettos where the philosophy of Rieder and Diems and\nGhent lay thick in smoke-fogged atmospheres, or in off-beat book stores\nwhere the outre tomes of Cresniner and Hulp and Bredder pre-empted\nthe shelves. And you may have seen him, too, if you happened along at\nthe right time, standing impatiently in front of the Metropolitanette,\nsmoking concatenations of cigarettes 'till the doors opened and egress\nto Verdi or Wagner could be obtained. And were you worldly enough, you\nmay have seen him waiting outside the stage door behind the old Libido\nwith a host of the macromammary Miranda's other pursuers, and you may\neven have read about the short-lived marriage he and she embarked on\nto the delight of the Sex Sheets and the Peeping Walters. After that,\nthough, if you saw him at all, you saw him in bars--or staggering\nbetween them.\n\nParkhurst walked into Lanesce's, took one look at Isolde and knew her\ninstantly.\n\nHe was sobering up at the time, having hit Sirius 21 a week ago, and\nthe Spaceport Bar five minutes after arrival. Perhaps he would have\nacted as he did even if he hadn't been sobering-up, but there is a\ncertain kind of remorse contained in the sobering-up process that makes\nthe sufferer more than normally susceptible to symbols of the higher\nplanes of civilization. In Isolde, Parkhurst saw the strength he needed\nat the moment, and the _raison d'etre_ he would need later on to\nstraighten out permanently. Before he even heard her voice raised in\nresounding recitative, as he did shortly when one of the good fellows\npresent, goosed her, he knew he had to have her.\n\nHe didn't have enough capital to buy her, but he did have enough to\nabscond with her to Procyon 16 where a boom was in progress and where\nyou could practically name your job. As Vanderzee kept Isolde quartered\nin the shed with his milch bront, abduction proved to be no problem,\nand Parkhurst managed to smuggle her on board a Procyon-bound tramp\nship without any trouble.\n\nOn Procyon 16, however, misfortune awaited him: the ulwano herds which\nthe good colonists had been systematically slaughtering for years in\norder that wealthy women all over the civilized sector of the galaxy\nmight know the secure feeling that accompanies owning an ulwano coat\nor stole, and in order that the good colonists themselves might know\nthe secure feeling that accompanies owning acres of real estate and\nscads of stock in interstellar banks, had perversely migrated into the\ninaccessible northern barrens, thereby precipitating a depression. Jobs\nwere not merely scarce: they were non-existent. Even worse, Parkhurst\ndidn't have enough money to buy passage back.\n\n\n\nIn common with most men of his kind, he could meet a crisis in one\nway, and in one way only. He had not taken a drink since Sirius 21,\nbut as soon as the seriousness of his predicament got through to\nhim, he headed straight for the Star and Traveler--a thriving little\nestablishment convenient to the spaceport, dedicated to the enhancement\nof human relationships via the congenial consumption of cut-rate gin.\nThe money he had left lasted him two days. His watch got him through\ntwo more. His extra clothing was going for three more. By that time,\nhis physical thirst was sated; his emotional thirst, however, was\nmerely stimulated. He had only one item left to sell, besides the\nclothes on his back, and so he sold Isolde--for one tenth of what she\nwas worth, and without ever having heard her sing the aria which he\nloved above all others and which she had been created for most: the\n_Liebestod_. Three days later, when he had sobered sufficiently to\nrealize what he had done, he hanged himself.\n\n\n\nIsolde's new owner was a missionary named Newell. He was dedicated\nto the task of bringing all the heathen in the known galaxy around\nto seeing things in their proper perspective, i.e., the way he saw\nthem. He was a devout disciple of Neo-Christianity, popularly known\nas FDRism, which had begun late in the twentieth century and which\nproclaimed Franklin Delano Roosevelt as the real Christ. He owned his\nown ship--the NRA--and he carried a collapsible chapel in the hold. As\nhe was unmarried and as most of the lands he visited turned out to be\nlonely as well as hostile, he bought Isolde to keep him company--and,\nof course, to keep the ship clean, do the cooking and darn his socks.\n\n\n\nHis first--and last--stop after leaving Procyon 16 was Idwandana, a\nprimitive province on the southern-most continent of Gamma Bootis 4.\nThe natives were a rusty brown in hue, stood on an average of five feet\nin height, used a glue-like mixture on their scarlet hair to make it\nstand up straight, and lived off the pweitl--a cow-like creature whose\nmilk they drank, whose flesh they ate and whose hides they used for\nlap-laps, tepees and gourds. Occasionally, they varied their diet by\neating each other.\n\nThe particular tribe Newell chose for his initial ministrations took\na dim view of FDRism right from the start. Taking from the rich\nand giving to the poor was a practice they indulged in habitually,\nproviding that the \"rich\" were their enemies and the \"poor\" were\nthemselves; but they could see no religious connection in the matter.\nOld Age Security they considered impractical, and sick benefits for\nincapacitated members of the community, left them cold. When an\nIdwandanan grew too old, he or she was cooked and eaten. If he or she\nbecame a detriment to the tribe because of illness or accident, he or\nshe was also cooked and eaten. So it always was, so should ever be.\nThere was only one god, and he was Bruggil, the giant who lived in the\nfire mountain and whose fiery breath you could sometimes see when he\nwent into a tantrum.\n\nIf the Reverend Newell had been a realistic person, he would have\nfolded up his chapel then and there, and took off for home. But then,\nif he had been a realistic person, he wouldn't have been trying to\nshove his credo down the throats of a race of savages who would just as\nsoon eat him as look at him.\n\nHe did not see the arrow till it was already protruding from his\nchest, and then he saw it only briefly. He fell, appropriately enough,\nin the doorway of the collapsible chapel he had come to love the way\nsome men love women and the way other men love wine. But here the\nappropriateness ended: the Idwandanans streaked out of the surrounding\nforest and quartered him neatly, whereupon they swarmed up the ladder\nto the ship's lock in search of the creature whom they believed to be\nhis mate. Isolde was in the galley, fixing breakfast, and it was no\ntrick at all for the foremost Idwandanan to creep up behind her and\nplunge his knife between her shoulder blades. It was a long knife, and\na sharp one--the best that the _beche-demer_ trader who supplied\nthe area, had in stock--and it went all the way through and came out\nbetween her synthetic breasts. The Idwandanan felt pretty proud of\nhimself, till she turned around and confronted him, whereupon he ran\nscreaming from the room.\n\nHe returned presently with several of his fellows, among them\nSkonsdoggugil, the chief. There was a prolonged palaver, after which\nIsolde's would-be executioner approached her and withdrew the knife. It\nhad done no damage whatsoever, even missing the small bellows that kept\nher chest rising and falling in a rhythmic and realistic imitation of\nhuman breathing. As for the holes it had made, her skin-plastic was of\nthe self-sealing type, and grew together forthwith. The bodice of the\ngingham dress Newell had outfitted her with, concealed this additional\nmiracle from the eyes of the Idwandanans, but Skonsdoggugil had seen\nenough: here was Bruggil's Bride, sent down from the fire mountain by\nways incomprehensible to man, to test the mettle of his children.\n\nThey built a temple for her deep in the forest, laboriously quarrying\nthe stone and dragging it through underbrush and vine to the chosen\nsite. Isolde watched, or seemed to be watching, and every now and then\nshe gave forth with recitative or aria. The Idwandanans interpreted\nthese outbursts as admonitions to hurry, and because of them, the\ntemple was completed much sooner than it otherwise would have been.\nAfter a lengthy ceremony, officiated by Skonsdoggugil, Isolde was\nescorted inside and seated upon a crude throne, after which a guard of\nhonor was installed without. By now, her goddesshood was unquestioned\nby even the most cynical. Was she not above such worldly necessities\nas eating and drinking? Had anyone ever seen her sleep? Oh, she was\nBruggil's Bride all right, and woe to the Idwandanan male who failed to\nmake his obeisance at her feet each time he slaughtered a pweitl, and\nwoe to the Idwandanan female who failed to attend the fertility fete\nwhich was held each night in the courtyard!\n\nIsolde reigned in the temple for five Earth-years, and she probably\nwould have gone right on reigning there till her batteries gave out and\nher tapes went dead and the little in-built motor of her heart ceased\nto whir if a certain native labor recruiter named Jose Swenson had not\nlanded in the _Malaita_ to pick up a payload of Idwandanans. As it\nwas, her reign came to an abrupt end.\n\n\n\nJose Swenson was a far cry from the Reverend Newell: his business was\nselling souls, not saving them, and he knew his business well. He had\nnot been in Idwandana a week before he had his hold jam-packed with\n\"fireheads,\" and he would have been away and gone an hour hence if,\nduring one of his forays into the forest, he had not glimpsed the crude\nstone temple.\n\nIn Swenson's mind, temples, even crude stone ones, were always\npotential sources of treasure. After all, who really knew but what\nthere were gold mines in Idwandana? Perhaps even diamond mines? And\nwhat more logical place was there for a race of superstitious savages\nto store the bounty gleaned therefrom than in their temple?\n\nSo instead of departing, he set forth once more into the forest, with\nsix members of his crew, leaving the remaining three members to guard\nthe _Malaita_. This was a tactical blunder, arising from his\nmistaken assumption that by now, all of the Idwandanans would be too\nterrified of stun grenades to cause any serious trouble. As a matter of\nfact, most of them were, but Skonsdoggugil wasn't, and reinforced by\nseveral tribal units from the north, with whom his own tribe claimed\nkinship, he attacked the _Malaita_ as soon as Swenson and his\nparty were out of earshot.\n\nThe attack went well, so well, in fact, that the three crew members\nwere neatly quartered on the deck before any of them had a chance to\nradio Swenson of the disaster. Skonsdoggugil wasted no time: after\nfreeing the prisoners in the hold and instructing them to guard the\nship, he armed his warriors with stun grenades stolen from the arsenal,\nand set out in pursuit of Swenson.\n\nSwenson had made good time, and was already within attacking distance\nof the temple. A stun grenade knocked out half the honor guard and\nsent the other half streaking for the forest. Swenson headed for the\nentrance. He could feel the diamonds trickling through his fingers. He\ncould taste the rich wine they would buy, and the luscious lips of the\nlovely women they would give him access to. He burst into the throne\nroom, hardly able to contain himself--\n\nAnd saw Isolde.\n\nThe Idwandanans had clothed her in their choicest of pweitl hides,\nand she had gone back to combing her hair in its original style. Her\npale blue eyes were clear and unwavering. The classic body with which\nAndroids, Inc., had endowed her was unsullied by either time or the\nelements, Swenson had been born in space and had spent most of his life\nin space. He had never been to Earth, and he had never seen an android.\nConsequently, he mistook Isolde for a real woman--a woman of heroic\nproportions, perhaps, but a woman radiant with the beauty he had looked\nfor all his life and never found, till now.\n\nSwenson forgot about the diamonds. He forgot about the gold. He stepped\nforward, touched Isolde's arm. The normal human temperature which her\nthermostat maintained, felt natural to his fingers. The softness of her\nsynthetic skin made his flesh tingle. \"A white goddess,\" he said. \"A\ngenuine honest-to-God white goddess!\"\n\nThe burst of recitative which his remark provoked, disconcerted him\nfor a moment. He had heard many languages in his day, but he had never\nheard one with such a violent intonation or such guttural syllables.\nIsolde, he concluded, must come from a world he had never touched upon\nin all his travels--a world remote from the ordinary pathways of man.\nAnd he was right, too, though in a way he did not dream.\n\nAt this point, a dull explosion sounded in the courtyard without,\nfollowed by another. Instantly alert, Swenson ran to the entrance--saw\nthe six men who had accompanied him, lying stunned on the flagstones.\nEven as he looked, a horde of \"fireheads\" streamed out of the forest,\nlong knives glittering. The quartering was accomplished in a matter of\nseconds.\n\nSickened, Swenson ran back into the temple. There was a wide aperture\nin the rear wall, and the better part of valor, he knew, would be to\nforget the white goddess, whom the natives would not harm anyway,\nand gain the forest. The Idwandanans' possession of stun grenades\nunmistakably indicated that they had taken the _Malaita_, but\nperhaps he could eke out an existence till another ship came. In any\nevent, burdening himself with a woman, however robust she might be,\nwould be detrimental to his success.\n\nThus he reasoned, but thus he did not act. When the first Idwandanans\ngained the temple, Bruggil's Bride was gone.\n\n\n\nThe heavy underbrush fought their footsteps, and Swenson had to keep\na constant drag on Isolde's arm, else she would not have accompanied\nhim at all. The shouts of their pursuers grew louder by the second.\nWhen they came to a river, he plunged into it unhesitatingly, pulling\nIsolde after him. She could not swim, of course, but he was an expert,\nand in a matter of minutes they were in midstream. If he had known that\nfor all her \"breathing\", she could not drown, their progress would\nhave been more rapid. Even so, they had nearly reached the opposite\nbank when the first of the Idwandanans emerged from the forest. By the\ntime dugouts were brought up so that the chase could be resumed (the\nIdwandanans could not swim), Swenson had scrambled up the bank and\npulled Isolde out of sight into the underbrush.\n\nHe ran straight ahead for about half a mile, clasping Isolde's hand\nin his, urging her along beside him. Then he turned at right angles\nand ran for another half mile. Finally he headed back for the river,\nswam across with Isolde, and plunged into the forest again. He halted\nfor a moment to get his breath, then went on. As nearly as he could\nfigure out, his course of action had been the one they would have least\nexpected him to take, and the fact that no further sounds of pursuit\nreached his ears indicated that he was right. Unless the Idwandanans\nwere better trackers than he thought they were, he and Isolde now had a\ngood chance of eluding them altogether.\n\nThey spent the night in a small clearing deep in the forest, sleeping\nupon the ground. Swenson was exhausted and he took it for granted that\nIsolde was too. In the middle of the night he awoke and was surprised\nat how cold it was. Isolde lay motionless a few feet from him,\nstarlight pale on her flaxen hair. He sat up, took off his coat and\ncovered her arms and shoulders. He was startled to see that her blue\neyes were open, and for a moment he had the impression that she had not\nslept at all. She looked up at him, as though trying to understand his\npresence, or perhaps his actions. Swenson did an unprecedented thing\nfor him: he found her hand and pressed it in his. \"Everything's going\nto be all right,\" he whispered, and lay down on the ground beside her\nand fell back to sleep.\n\nIn the morning they went on. Swenson was famished, but dared not eat\nany of the berries and fruits they came across occasionally. Isolde\nignored them completely. In the afternoon they came to a large grassy\nclearing, and Swenson was astonished to see a New Deal chapel sitting\nin the middle of it. Beside the chapel stood a small but staunch\nspaceship. By squinting his eyes, he was able to make out its name: the\nNRA.\n\nHe could hardly contain his excitement, and started running across the\nclearing, Isolde at his side. But Skonsdoggugil, remembering Bruggil's\nBride's connection with the ship, had gambled that she and her captor\nwould show up in its vicinity sooner or later, and his warriors were\nready and waiting in the New Deal chapel. They came pouring out as\nsoon as Swenson and Isolde reached the base of the ship, and charged,\nwaving their razor-edged blades.\n\nSwenson started Isolde up the ladder, then turned and drew his\nknife-ray. He cut furiously, and \"fireheads\" fell like flies. But one\nof them managed to get through, and when Swenson finally ascended the\nladder, he was minus a forearm.\n\nHalf fainting, he activated the lock, which the Idwandanans had\naccidentally closed and had been unable to reopen, and pulled Isolde\ninside. At the forest's edge Skonsdoggugil was mustering another\ncontingent of warriors. Swenson pulled Isolde into the ship proper,\nsecured the outer and inner locks. With her help, he got a tourniquet\non the stump of his arm. Everything was swimming before his eyes by\nthen, but he managed to gain the control room and strap Isolde and\nhimself onto the two acceleration couches. He had one chance, and one\nchance only: to reach civilization before he bled to death. Hastily he\ncalculated the co-ordinates of the nearest civilized planet, and fed\nthem into the automatic pilot. He activated the pilot just before he\nblacked out.\n\nIt was his haste that was his undoing. The planet he had wanted was\nDelta Bootis 11, and the NRA should have snapped out of transphotic\nwithin orbiting distance in less than three objective days. On the\nfourth day, however, they were still in f.t.l. drive.\n\nSwenson knew by then that he was dying. What he did not know was that\nIsolde was dying, too. Constant usage had depleted her batteries long\nbefore their guarantee was due to run out, and there was very little\nlife left in them. But she showed no signs of her approaching demise,\npreparing his meals in the galley each day and bringing them to the\ncontrol room where he still lay upon the acceleration couch. She even\nfed him as he grew weaker, and once he roused briefly from a long\nstupor to find her darning his socks.\n\nCo-ordinates, once fed into an automatic pilot, could not be cancelled;\nbut automatic pilots were so constructed that whenever they received\nnon-planetary co-ordinates, they altered them to the co-ordinates of\nthe inhabitable planet which most closely corresponded to them. The\nNRA, therefore, could not end up in planetless space.\n\nAs the days passed, Swenson began wondering what kind of a world they\nwere approaching, and whether he would ever see it or not. On the sixth\nday, his questions were answered when the NRA emerged from transphotic\nin the midst of a multiple sun system, near a gray and foreboding\nsphere. He pretended as long as he could that there was life on it,\nbut when the a.p. put the ship into orbit, he could pretend no longer.\nInhabitable did not always mean inhabited, and those cold gray seas and\nbarren continents drifting past the viewport had been dead for ages.\nWhoever had lived on this world had long since absconded to a warmer,\nless hostile, milieu.\n\nThe a.p. brought them down to a gentle landing on a rocky coast near\none of the seas. It was night, but in the heavens the mother sun's\nthree distant sisters blazed in blue and beautiful splendor, drenching\nthe sea and the land, filtering through the viewport and filling the\ncontrol room with cold, unwavering light. In its radiance, Isolde's\nface lost all of the sycophancy the converter had superimposed upon it\nand became once more the classic face of the Irish-German heroine it\nwas meant to represent.\n\nLooking at her, Swenson knew true beauty for the first and last time in\nhis life. He tried to sit up on the couch, sank back. The blue light\nfaded, and red light took its place. Gradually, that faded too, and\nlightlessness tiptoed around him on silent feet.\n\nIsolde knelt beside him, looked down into his tired face. Slowly, she\ngot up, and left the room. She touched the button that opened the locks\nand stepped out upon the little platform Newell once had used for a\npulpit. She looked up at the stars.\n\nPerhaps it was the expression that had come over Swenson's face just\nbefore he died; perhaps it was the way he lay upon the couch. Perhaps\nit was the kindnesses he had shown her, and the light that had come\ninto his eyes whenever she had brought him food, or held his hand, or\ndarned his socks. Perhaps it was the sound of the surf upon the forlorn\nshore. Perhaps it was all of these things....\n\n\n\nTristan lies dead now, in his castle by the sea. Brangane has made her\nrevelation. King Marke has cried out in anguish and despair. \"_Todt\ndenn Alles--Alles todt!_\"\n\nIsolde presses her hands together on her breast. She drops them slowly\nto her sides. The blue radiance of the distant suns has transformed\nher coarse garment of hides into a robe fit for the princess that she\nis. Her face, in her vast sorrow, has attained new pinnacles of beauty--\n\n\"_Tristan!_\" The magnificent Flagstad voice rises into the\nradiance of the blue suns.\n\nSlowly, brokenly, Isolde begins the _Liebestod_--\n\n\"_So might we die as ne'er to part...._\"\n\nShe hears the orchestra take up the themes of bliss, of parting; of\ntransfiguration. She blends her voice into the music. The poignant\ncolonnades of sound rise higher and ever higher into the stars, and\nwhen the climax is reached on a heart-rending surge of sound, the blue\nsuns tremble in the sky.\n\nSlowly, Isolde turns and re-enters the ship. She sinks down upon\nTristan's breast, just as the little armature in her heart makes one\nfinal revolution and lies still. In the background of her fading\nbrain, the music returns briefly to the themes of her magic and of her\nyearnings, dies gently away....\n\nThe curtain falls.",
