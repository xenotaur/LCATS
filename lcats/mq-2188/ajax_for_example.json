    "body": "by W. C. Tuttle\n\n\n\u201cHorse sense,\u201d says \u201cMagpie\u201d Simpkins, \u201cconsists of knowing\nsomething that no school-teacher could pound into your head with a\npile-driver. It\u2019s a sort of an initiative and referendum that books\ncan\u2019t tell you about, and if you ain\u2019t got it, Ike, you might as\nwell get you a loaf of bread, a jug of wine and hide out in the\nbrush, where you won\u2019t hamper folks with your idiocy. There was\nAjax, for example.\u201d\n\nMagpie hooks his spurs into the top of the table and leans back in\nhis chair. He knows there ain\u2019t no argument, but hopes I\u2019ll find\none. I agrees with Magpie--for once. I\u2019ll tell you why I agree with\nhim, and maybe you\u2019ll agree with me.\n\nMe and you both know that there\u2019s educated fools. If I can have my\nchoice I\u2019ll take the fool that never got educated in preference to\none what absorbed everything he found in books, \u2019cause the educated\none can\u2019t even crawl into a blanket without peering into a book to\nsee the definition of the word \u201ccrawl,\u201d the proper uses of a\nblanket, and the procedure according to precedent.\n\nYessir, there was Ajax, for example.\n\nMe and Magpie are cooking breakfast in our cabin on Plenty Stone\nCreek one Summer morning, when we hears footsteps approaching on\nhorseback. Magpie steps to the door with a pan of bacon in his hand\nand peers outside. He takes one look and tries to scratch his head\nwith the pan, the same of which leaves our hog-meat on the floor.\n\nThen he looks back at me.\n\n\u201cIke, come here! It\u2019s either a mistake or I\u2019m mistaken.\u201d\n\nI walks over and takes a look. Looks like one of Sam Holt\u2019s\nrat-tailed broncs, but the rider--whooee! I don\u2019t blame Magpie for\ndropping the bacon. I\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 dropped a stick of dynamite if I\u2019d had\none.\n\nI\u2019ll begin at the top and work on down. First we have a hat. She\nlooks like a cross between a ordinary hard hat and a campaign lid,\nbeing as she\u2019s sort of flat on the top. Under said hat cometh hair,\nwhich seems to grow straight out.\n\nThen we have a pair of funeral-rimmed specs forking the longest,\nskinniest nose I ever seen. I feels that it must blow about the same\nnote as the stopped-down E string on a fiddle. The chin of the\ncritter seems to be so long that the weight of it holds his mouth\nopen.\n\nWe have with us now the neck. To speak like a poet I\u2019d say that he\nhad the neck of a swan. Maybe not so graceful, but longer. His\nshoulders shows a heap of neglect, and from there he just sort of\nslopes off to his feet, which is some slope, if you asks me.\n\nRiding with his elbows has made his sleeves pull up almost to his\nshoulders, and hanging on with his knees has pulled up the legs of\nhis pants until he\u2019s setting on most of \u2019em. He ain\u2019t anything for a\ndrinking man to look at--if he likes the taste of liquor.\n\nMe and Magpie stands there sort of weak-like and watches him search\nhis pockets. He ain\u2019t said a word yet. The more pockets he searches\nthe less he seems to find. He grunts and reaches for his hip pocket,\nthe same of which seems to bend his legs backwards until his heels\ncatch in that bronc\u2019s flanks.\n\n_Zowie!_\n\nThat rat-tailed bronc resents such familiarity, with the result that\nsaid apparition lands setting down in our front yard while the\ninsulted bronc wends its way home.\n\nI plumb forgot to mention that this person carried a little valise\non the saddle-horn. Yes, it came off with him.\n\nHe sets there on the chip-pile blinking like a old owl, and then he\nproduces an envelope from his hip pocket. Then he adjusts his specs\nand peers up at us.\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d says he.\n\n\u201cYou have it,\u201d says Magpie.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t catch that bronc this side of Piperock,\u201d says I. \u201cHe\u2019s\nstill throwing sand.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh! Oh, the--er--equine? Ah! Unavoidable, I assure you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSetting as you were,\u201d admits Magpie. \u201cGood scheme to always watch a\nbronc\u2019s ears, old-timer.\u201d\n\n\u201cPleasant pastime, I have no doubt,\u201d he agrees. \u201cOh, quite\ninteresting. May I ask if either of you gentlemen is Mr. Simpson?\u201d\n\n\u201cLittle high and to the right,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cI\u2019m Simpkins.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, yes! Delighted, I assure you. My mistake.\u201d\n\nHe peers at the letter.\n\n\u201cVery good indeed. Simpkins it is. I beg your pardon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to get splinters in you if you don\u2019t get up,\u201d states\nMagpie.\n\n\u201cThank you very, very much,\u201d says he, handing the letter to Magpie.\n\n\u201cThis is my--er--introductions, Mr. Simpson.\u201d\n\n\u201cS-i-m-p-k-i-n-s,\u201d spells Magpie.\n\n\u201cAh, yes. Very simple.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d says I. \u201cVery.\u201d\n\nMagpie opens the letter, and I reads it over his shoulder.\n\n    My Dear Simpkins:\n\n    The bearer, Professor Ajax Ulysses Green, B.A., F.H.S.,\n    K.P., I.O.O.F., B.P.O.E., etc., etc., is desirous of\n    testing out some pet theory, and I am taking the liberty\n    of sending him to you, knowing that you and Ike will see\n    that he gets what is coming to him. Do with him as you\n    will--and I know you will.\n\n    Professor Pettingill joins me in sending you our best\n    regards and hopes some day to see you again. Remember us\n    to Dirty Shirt Jones, and all the rest of the Pelicans\n    we met in the county of Yellow Rock.\n\n                              Very sincerely yours,\n                                          F. H. Middleton.\n\n    P. S.--As Dirty Shirt says, \u201cFor ----\u2019s sake, did you ever\n    see the like?\u201d He really is considered a brilliant man,\n    and devoted to his work. Do as you see fit--but spare\n    him, as Pettingill and myself will not rest well until\n    he returns to Boston and tells of his experiences.\n\n\u201cProfessor Middleton is one of my dear, dear friends,\u201d explains this\nalphabetical person sweet-like. \u201cHe was primarily responsible for my\ncoming. You may thank him.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy!\u201d gasps Magpie. \u201cI may, may I? Well, well! Come in, Ajax.\u201d\n\n\u201cI prefer to be known as Professor Green, if it is not too much\ntrouble,\u201d says he stiff-like, but Magpie grins and says:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Magpie; this is Ike. You\u2019re Ajax. _Sabe?_\u201d\n\n\u201cRather--er--personal, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d you like Ulysses?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cNo. If I have no choice in the matter I\u2019d prefer Ajax.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I had my choice of weapons I\u2019d take a pickax,\u201d grins Magpie.\n\u201cAre you the hombre what discovered lightning?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no! The original Ajax defied the lightning, don\u2019t you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe made a sucker play,\u201d says I. \u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t _sabe_\nelectricity.\u201d\n\nAjax refused to smoke a cigaret, so we gave him an old pipe that\n\u201cPolecat\u201d Perkins left in our shack, but he didn\u2019t seem to care for\nit.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d says Magpie, \u201cwe\u2019d admire to hear what you came here for.\u201d\n\n               *       *       *       *       *\n\nAjax crosses his legs, adjusts his glasses and clears his throat.\nIt\u2019s some job to clear a throat like his. The best way, I reckon,\nwould be to drop in a can of nitroglycerin like they do in\noil-wells.\n\n\u201cI am here,\u201d says he, rubbing his hands together, \u201cto study the\neffects of astragalas splendens on the genus Ovius.\u201d\n\nMe and Magpie looks at each other and then at Ajax.\n\n\u201cIt is very interesting, don\u2019t you think?\u201d asks Ajax.\n\nMagpie walks over to the stove and begins to cut more bacon. After\nhe gets it on the stove he turns to Ajax.\n\n\u201cWhat do you drink for breakfast?\u201d\n\n\u201cRarely anything, I thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ought to take something,\u201d says I.\n\n\u201cWell, if I should, I prefer a beverage of _thea sinensis_.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy ----!\u201d grunts Magpie. \u201cWe\u2019re all out of that. Ike, I told you to\nget us some the last time you was in Piperock.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not necessary at all,\u201d says Ajax.\n\n\u201cI know it ain\u2019t,\u201d agrees Magpie, \u201cbut I\u2019d sure like to know what in\n---- it is.\u201d\n\nAjax drank water. Later on me and Magpie got his dictionary and\nlooked up everything that human beings drink, and we found that that\ndanged word-strangler wanted tea.\n\nHe don\u2019t _sabe_ Blackfeet, Flathead or Chinook, and won\u2019t talk\nUnited States. We can\u2019t understand his wau-wau; so we can see that\neventually some of us are going to be badly misunderstood.\n\nIf it hadn\u2019t been for Professor Middleton we\u2019d have lured Ajax to a\ntall place in the trail and shoved him off. He wasn\u2019t even funny.\n\nIf you poked a gun under his nose he wouldn\u2019t have horse sense\nenough to hold up his hands. No, I\u2019ll be danged if he would! He\u2019d\nlikely smell into the muzzle, look it over careful-like and then\nclassify it in a language that nobody in Yaller Rock County could\ninterpret.\n\nAfter breakfast he says--\n\n\u201cI will rest today if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cRest in peace,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cTake root if you must, but for the\nlove of Moses try and bend your back and be sociable. You don\u2019t\nsmoke, and if you did swear in your own little way nobody\u2019d\nunderstand you. Do you drink?\u201d\n\n\u201c_Spiritus frumenti?_\u201d\n\n\u201cGo to ----! Next time I says good morning to you, Ajax, it will be\nin sign language. I\u2019m through talking to you, that\u2019s a cinch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not consider it obligatory,\u201d says he lofty-like, and I just\ngrabs Magpie\u2019s hand in time.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t hold the hand of progress, Ike,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cCan you figure\nout one good reason why I shouldn\u2019t kill him?\u201d\n\n\u201cExcept that we don\u2019t know exactly where to ship his remains. He\u2019s\nfrom Boston, Magpie, but it ain\u2019t like saying, \u2018He\u2019s from Piperock.\u2019\nYou\u2019ve got to figure that Boston covers considerable space, and\nuntil we finds out his home address we better let him suffer.\n_Sabe?_\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is your home, Ajax?\u201d asks Magpie.\n\n\u201cHome? The habitual abode of one\u2019s family?\u201d\n\nI lets loose of Magpie\u2019s hand and reached for my own gun, but the\ncoming of Dirty Shirt Jones saves me from killing a fool-hen out of\nseason. Dirty slides off his bronc and nods to us. Then he sees\nAjax. He peers at Ajax for a minute and then gets right back on his\nbronc.\n\n\u201cGet off and rest your feet, Dirty,\u201d says I, but Dirty only stares\nat Ajax and shakes his head.\n\nDirty shakes his head like a bee was buzzing around his ear. He\nshuts his eyes, shakes his head hard, and looks again.\n\n\u201cMy!\u201d says he awed-like. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of things in my life. I\u2019ve\nseen a tarantaler waltzing with a angle-worm, I have. I\u2019ve seen a\nlittle green devil riding a Gila monster in a race against a horned\ntoad which was ridden by me, but I\u2019ve always been able to shake \u2019em\nloose for a minute. This\u2019n I can\u2019t!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am Professor Ajax Ulysses Green,\u201d says Ajax stiff-like. \u201cIt is\nextremely embarrassing when one\u2019s friends forget the--I--er--it\nplaces me in a position wherein I am forced to introduce myself to\none whom my acquaintances greet as one of their own kind.\nEmbarrassing, I assure you.\u201d\n\n\u201cEx-cuse me,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cAjax, let me make you used to Dirty\nShirt. Dirty, this here is Ajax.\u201d\n\n\u201cName\u2019s familiar,\u201d says Dirty, scratching his head. \u201cOh, yes!\n\u2018Boiled Egg\u2019 Benson had a jassack by that name. I wondered who he\nnamed it after and why he used to kick it in the ribs all the time.\nPoor mule!\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe Dirty Shirt could help you, Ajax. He\u2019s seen about all there\nis in this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cPossibly,\u201d agrees Ajax. \u201cI\u2019d be grateful to a startling degree.\u201d\n\nAnd then he turns to Dirty.\n\n\u201cI am out here, sir, to study the effects of astragalas splendens on\nthe genus Ovius.\u201d\n\nDirty spits out his cigaret and clamps his jaws hard.\n\n\u201cBefore you do anything, Dirty, appeal to your better nature,\u201d says\nI.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think, Dirty?\u201d asks Magpie.\n\n\u201cThink?\u201d\n\nDirty swings his bronc around and talks to us over his shoulder.\n\n\u201cI think you three has had all the fun you\u2019re going to out of me. I\ndon\u2019t know what it means, but you can all go to ---- as far as I\u2019m\nconcerned.\u201d\n\nWe watches him ride off down the road.\n\n\u201cIs he--er--entirely sane?\u201d asks Ajax, watching Dirty disappear.\n\n\u201cNot now,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cA human being can only stand so much. He\ngot bit by a hipwiggler the other night.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh! Quite interesting.\u201d\n\nAnd he writes something in his little book.\n\nAjax wanted to rest that day, so we didn\u2019t bother him none. It gave\nus a chance to control our natural impulses to kill him, and also\ngave us a chance to do a little placer work.\n\nI asks Magpie that night if we\u2019re supposed to give up our bunk to\nAjax, but Magpie gives me one look which is plenty of answers.\nAnyway Ajax didn\u2019t desire it.\n\n\u201cProfessor Middleton told me of the wonders of sleeping under the\nglorious firmament,\u201d says Ajax, \u201cand I desire to experience it as he\ndescribed.\u201d\n\n\u201cFairly well ventilated,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cNice enough unless she rains\nor a hipwiggler comes along.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is \u2018she,\u2019 and what is a hipwiggler, if I may ask?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe?\u201d\n\nMagpie smooths his mustache and scowls at the ground.\n\n\u201cOh, yes; the hipwiggler. The hipwiggler is a animal. If one comes\nalong and finds you sleeping on the ground it just plumb ruins you\nfor future use. You\u2019re dead--that\u2019s about all.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour--er--friend you spoke about,\u201d says Ajax. \u201cWas he sleeping\non----\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh. A log saved his life. It\u2019s thisaway, Ajax: A hipwiggler is\na queer animal. It always prospects a man from his head down to his\ntoes. It gets to the end of you and then starts eating its way back.\n_Sabe?_\n\n\u201cDirty Shirt went to sleep with his feet on a log. The hipwiggler\ncomes along, walks to where it strikes the ground and then starts\neating. It ain\u2019t got no _sabe_--not a bit. This one didn\u2019t _sabe_\nthat Dirty had his feet on a log; so it went to the end of the log\nand starts eating. Logs ain\u2019t noways digestible, so it got disgusted\nand left Dirty alone.\u201d\n\nAjax took it all in and then gets inquisitive.\n\n\u201cCould I procure a specimen?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope. They only sleep between twelve and one o\u2019clock, and nobody\nknows where they hole up. To catch one any other time you\u2019ve got to\ntake a sack in your hands, stand on the stump of a persimmon-tree\nand make a noise like a loofmad.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I see. Quite complicated. More of this later, as I am\ninterested.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou deserve to be,\u201d says I. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Middleton----\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, yes. I am deeply indebted to Middleton, the dear fellow. I\nshall mention him in my monograph.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo it,\u201d urges Magpie. \u201cI\u2019ll do the same--in my prayers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI--I feel that I am going to make some wonderful discoveries out\nhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says Magpie, \u201cthat remains to be seen, as the feller said\nwhen he dug into the Injun\u2019s grave.\u201d\n\n               *       *       *       *       *\n\nAjax gets a little skittish about sleeping outdoors, so he rolls up\nin a blanket on the floor. Me and Magpie are heavy sleepers, but he\nwoke us up in the night. We sets up in bed and listens to him. He\u2019s\nmaking a lot of noise like he was trying to move the cabin.\n\nMagpie is just getting up to see what the trouble is when Ajax comes\nin, grunting and wheezing. Comes a big bump on the floor, a deep\nsigh from Ajax, and then everything is still again; so we goes to\nsleep.\n\nIn the morning Magpie kicks me in the ribs, and I sets up in bed.\nThere is Ajax laying on the floor with his bare legs bent up over a\nsection of pine log about thirty inches in diameter. Magpie snorts\nright out, and Ajax sets up.\n\nHe looks all around the cabin and then reaches for his pants.\n\n\u201cI thank you for the information, my dear Mr. Simpson,\u201d says he. \u201cI\nfeel that the section of the genus Pinus was the means of saving my\nlife. Several times after securing it I felt the deadly hipwiggler\ntravel my entire length, only to fall off the log in surprize. It\nwas a sensation I can not wish for again, but one I feel fortunate\nto have experienced. I thank you for your timely advice.\u201d\n\nMagpie smoothed his mustache and stared at me and we both danged\nnear choked. Ajax sure offered himself as a highway for pack-rats\nthat night.\n\nThen cometh Judge Steele. He\u2019s the educatedest hombre in the county.\nIf there\u2019s anything he don\u2019t know he won\u2019t admit it. He owns\nhalf-interest in a claim up the creek, and is on his way up there\nwith a pack-load of grub for his pardner.\n\nWe asks him in to breakfast \u2019cause you never can tell when you\u2019ll\nneed the friendship of a judge.\n\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d says he to me and Magpie, and then he sees Ajax.\n\n\u201cGood gosh!\u201d\n\n\u201cHowdy, judge,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cSet in on the bacon.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d says Ajax. \u201cA judge. Are you an LL.B.?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope. Missourian and a stanch Republican.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh! It is refreshing to meet an educated man in the wilds. Where\ndid you matriculate, may I ask?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did I what?\u201d\n\n\u201cMatriculate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on my way to my mine, and I started from Piperock, if it\u2019s\nanybody\u2019s danged business.\u201d\n\nAnd then he turns to Magpie.\n\n\u201cFriend of yours?\u201d\n\n\u201cLiability, judge. He\u2019s trailing something that ain\u2019t here nor never\nwas.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh! What\u2019s he after?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou tell him, Ajax. Something about strangling the----\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not a subject to cause levity,\u201d chides Ajax. \u201cIs there any\nreason why I should not come here to study the effects of astragalas\nsplendens on the genus Ovius?\u201d\n\nThe judge stands up to drink his coffee and then goes out to his\nhorses.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think, judge?\u201d I asks.\n\nHe picks up the lead rope of his pack-horse and ponders the\nquestion.\n\n\u201cIke, I hate to give out a judicial reply as I might be called upon\nto render a decision from the bench, but I\u2019ll say this much: Any\njury in Yaller Rock County would convict him without leaving their\nseats.\u201d\n\nHe gets on his horse and pilgrims off up the trail.\n\n\u201cHow quaint,\u201d grins Ajax. \u201cIs he really a presiding judge or did he\nsimply acquire the title as many Westerners are reputed to have?\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe he is,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cDanged if I don\u2019t believe he is.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs what?\u201d asks Ajax.\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, no doubt,\u201d agrees Ajax foolish-like, and we let the matter\nrest.\n\nAjax puttered around for a while and then came to us.\n\n\u201cMay I--er--have a piece of rope? Three yards will be sufficient.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlenty,\u201d agrees Magpie pleased-like.\n\n\u201cYou know how to tie the proper kind of a knot?\u201d\n\n\u201cI-- Perhaps not, but----\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pleasure is all mine,\u201d says Magpie.\n\nAjax looks the knot over interested-like.\n\n\u201cBeg pardon, but will you tell me why you wound the rope around so\nmany times?\u201d\n\n\u201cThirteen times,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cAny sheriff knows how. Now, do you\nwant us to elevate the wagon-tongue or do you prefer a limb?\u201d\n\nAjax\u2019s mouth hangs open for a full minute, and then he seems to\ncatch the point.\n\n\u201cHe, he, he! You--you thought perhaps I wanted to make a--er--a\nswing, I believe they call them. You were spoofing me, I fear. No, I\nthank you.\u201d\n\nAnd he wandered away across the hills alone.\n\n\u201cIke,\u201d says Magpie; \u201cwere you spoofing? A swing! My ----!\u201d\n\nWe worked for a while but can\u2019t seem to get Ajax out of our minds.\n\nThe blamed fool might get lost or bit by a snake. Sidewinders don\u2019t\nrespect education. After a while Magpie says:\n\n\u201cIke, if it wasn\u2019t for Middleton I\u2019d let the blamed fool sink or\nswim, survive or perish, but I\u2019d hate to rob Middleton of a chance\nto hear Ajax tell his experiences. Reckon we better pesticate around\na little and see where he went. I\u2019d admire to find out what he\u2019s\nafter.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said it was the effects of--\u201d I began, but Magpie looked at me\nwith his sweet smile and I shut up.\n\n               *       *       *       *       *\n\nAjax pointed almost due south, but we figured he\u2019d bear a little to\nthe west, so we cut across. We\u2019re pilgriming down into a draw at the\nhead of a little fork of Medicine Creek when all to once we busts\ninto a clearing, and Magpie stops.\n\nI bumped into him, and then looked over his shoulder. There is\n\u201cDoleful\u201d Doolittle, who herds sheep when he\u2019s sober enough, and\nstanding in front of him is Ajax.\n\nThem hombres sure show signs of rough usage. Ajax\u2019s hat is smashed\ndown over his nose, and he\u2019s looking out from between the crown and\nthe brim. His coat is split up the back, and his long legs wabble a\nheap.\n\nDoleful has lost one sleeve and his belt, the same of which causes\nhim to hang on to his pants, so they won\u2019t come down and trip him.\nIf Doleful had twice as much sense he\u2019d be almost half-witted.\n\n\u201cHear me?\u201d yelps Doleful, shaking his one free hand at Ajax. \u201cI\u2019m\ntellin\u2019 you hereby that I\u2019m aimin\u2019 to show you, feller!\u201d\n\n\u201cVery ungrammatical, to say the least,\u201d pants Ajax. \u201cNow I wish you\nto desist. Fisticuffs are a relic of----\u201d\n\n\u201cI _sabe_,\u201d says Doleful, spitting on his hands. \u201cSet yourself,\nfeller, \u2019cause I\u2019m coming wide open like a wolf!\u201d\n\n_Boof!_\n\nDoleful takes a skip and a jump and lands on Ajax\u2019s bosom, and they\nboth went into the alkali. It was some fight. They\u2019re both yelling\nfor help in about ten seconds, and then they gets to their feet.\n\n\u201cYou long-faced son-of-a-sea-cook, you bited me!\u201d howls Doleful,\nrubbing his ear.\n\n\u201cIt was--uh--but fighting the dud-devil with fuf-fire,\u201d wheezes\nAjax. \u201cYou masticated my e-ear, friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cFriend?\u201d yells Doleful. \u201cDon\u2019t you call me friend! I hate ---- out\nof you, by ginger! Hold fast, \u2019cause I\u2019m coming to visit you again!\u201d\n\nAjax sidestepped this time, and when Doleful stumbled over his legs\nAjax fell on top of him. Man, they sure investigated each other.\nDoleful kicked, whooped and yelped and managed to squirm loose,\nminus one boot, which Ajax has annexed.\n\nFor a minute Ajax seems to show human intelligence by hammering\nDoleful over the head with the boot. Doleful wails loud and clear\nand hops away a few feet, where he takes off the other boot and\ncomes back at Ajax.\n\n\u201cGod didn\u2019t make men equal but boots did,\u201d says Magpie, and then\nthem two are at it again.\n\nIt was some duel if you asks me, and before they\u2019re at it a minute\nme and Magpie are weeping on each other\u2019s bosom. They never seen us.\nIn fact they hadn\u2019t been at it a minute until they couldn\u2019t see each\nother.\n\nPretty soon Doleful makes a wild swing, and the heel of that boot\nhit Ajax at the butt of his ear. That was plenty for Ajax, who\nsprawls on his face in the dirt, but Doleful didn\u2019t know it. He kept\nright on, hopping back and forth, whaling away with that boot at\nsomething that ain\u2019t there.\n\n\u201cLook at the danged fool!\u201d gasps Magpie. \u201cHe can\u2019t see!\u201d\n\nJust then Doleful makes an extra hard swing, his foot slipped, and\nthe toe of that boot hit him under the chin. He straightens up,\nshrugs his shoulders like a Frenchman and then falls flat on his\nback--knocked out, or rather kicked out.\n\n\u201cHonest to ---- that never happened,\u201d sobs Magpie. \u201cAw, it couldn\u2019t!\nHe hit himself in the-- Haw, haw, haw!\u201d\n\nI haw-haws with him, and we cries a duet.\n\nPretty soon Doleful gets to his feet, walks around in a circle and\nappears to be listening. Then Ajax coughs and sets up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a gosh-darn plenty,\u201d states Doleful in a whisper. \u201cHear\nme?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d says Ajax.\n\n\u201cYou danged hog!\u201d wails Doleful. \u201cI know when I\u2019ve had a plenty.\nWhere is my boots?\u201d\n\nAjax feels of his ear like he half-expected to find the boot in\nthere, but when he don\u2019t find it he shakes his head.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d states Doleful. \u201cMy gosh, it\u2019s dark today! I can just\nsee enough to miss hittin\u2019 trees, and that\u2019s about all. Where are\nyou?\u201d\n\n\u201cT fear I\u2019m not able to give you concise information on the\nsubject,\u201d says Ajax painful-like, \u201cbecause I am not aware of my\nexact position. If it will enlighten you to any extent I will say\nthis much; I am on the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you stay there,\u201d advises Doleful. \u201cIf I step on you don\u2019t get\nsore, \u2019cause I don\u2019t mean nothing but good-by. _Sabe?_\u201d\n\nDoleful stumbles across Ajax\u2019s feet and goes weaving off through the\nmesquite, hanging on to his pants and picking up cactus in his feet.\nThen Ajax gets to his feet and peers around. His specs are still\nhanging around his neck, and he tries to put \u2019em on. He\u2019s been\nbooted across the bridge of his nose, the same of which makes his\nspecs feel like his nose was in a vise.\n\nHe yanks \u2019em off, and then begins to search his pockets. After a\nwhile he finds what he\u2019s looking for. Then he feels his way over to\na rock, where he gets interested in looking at something--or trying\nto. We sneaked over and took a look. He\u2019s got a compass on the rock,\nand is talking to himself.\n\n\u201cUnless I am greatly mistaken I traveled due south. Due north would\ntake me--uh-- Now would it? Which way did I pursue the Ovius? Well,\nno matter, as I can not see the compass, therefore I am lost.\nPerhaps my shadow will inform me of the position of the sun, and by\ntaking the time of day----\u201d\n\nHe turns and peers at the ground.\n\n\u201cFutile,\u201d he mutters. \u201cThere is no shadow. No matter, as my watch is\nnot running. Still I am lost. Not knowing the proper procedure in\nsuch a case, I will endeavor to remain stationary until such a time\nas I may regain the use of my optic nerves. I will think of a\nremedy.\u201d\n\n\u201cRaw beefsteak is hyiu stuff,\u201d suggests Magpie. \u201cEver try it?\u201d\n\nAjax almost hopped out of his shoes. He peers at us, and then:\n\n\u201cAh! Raw steak? I greatly prefer mine medium, _en casserole_.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no use, Ike,\u201d sighs Magpie. \u201cI had hopes that he\u2019d been hit so\nhard that he\u2019d talk our language, but I\u2019m a poor guesser. You take\none side, Ike, and I\u2019ll take the other.\u201d\n\n               *       *       *       *       *\n\nAjax led like a old pack-horse and didn\u2019t have much to say. We asked\nhim why he was sore at Doleful, and he said the idea was absurd. We\ntied some raw meat over his eyes, and by supper-time he was able to\nfeel the difference between a knife and a fork.\n\n\u201cMaybe some day you _hombres_ will stay in the East where you\nbelong,\u201d says Magpie disgusted-like. \u201cYou sure gallop in where\nnatives fear to sneak.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe scientists must suffer that the masses be informed,\u201d explains\nAjax.\n\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t going to get a lot of publicity by fighting a boot duel\nwith a half-witted herder,\u201d says I.\n\n\u201cIt was no violence of my making, I assure you, Mr. Harper. I was\nchasing the elusive Ovius when this vulgar person came between us.\nHe used very insulting adjectives--very! My lips could never repeat\nthe strange things he said. Naturally I resented. I descended to the\nlevel of a brute, and fought as my ancestors fought.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of boot-leggers,\u201d says Magpie, \u201cbut you must \u2019a\u2019 sprung\nfrom a family of boot-fighters, Ajax. Did you hit him first?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not. Nor second or third. In fact he pummeled me for some\ntime before I seemed to grasp his intentions, and then I\nretaliated.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ought to carry a boot,\u201d advises Magpie. \u201cFeller like you ought\nto go heeled all the time. What do you aim to do next?\u201d\n\n\u201cNext?\u201d\n\nAjax rubs his sore eyes and looks up at Magpie.\n\n\u201cI shall certainly persevere until I have observed fully the effects\nof astragalas splendens upon the----\u201d\n\nBut me and Magpie went out and left him talking to himself.\n\nWe helped Ajax bring in his foot-rest that night and watched him go\nto bed with his feet thirty inches higher than his head. He\u2019s so\nall-in that he never felt the pack-rats that night, and the next\nmorning he\u2019s a sorry-looking hunk of scientific humanity.\n\nHis clothes are about seven-eighths to the sere and yaller leaf. His\nvalise don\u2019t contain nothing but a book, some papers and a box of\npills. Magpie looks him over from all angles.\n\n\u201cSomebody will kill you, Ajax, if you dress thataway,\u201d says Magpie.\n\u201cIn memory of Professor Middleton me and Ike will have to dress you\ncivilized-like, I reckon.\u201d\n\nWe got him into an old pair of boots, one of my shirts and an old\nsombrero of Magpie\u2019s. He looks like ----, but he don\u2019t know it. Then\nhe wants another length of rope.\n\n\u201cYou going back to the same place?\u201d I asks.\n\nHe considers it a moment, and shakes his head.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe I will. That vulgar person might accost me again,\nand I have no time to waste in combat. I will try in another\ndirection, if it makes no particular difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe and Ike are neutral,\u201d says Magpie.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019d tell us just about what in ---- you\u2019re hunting for, maybe\nwe\u2019d advise you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, thank you. You see I wish to observe the effects of\nastragala----\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome!\u201d yelps Magpie. \u201cGo ahead, and may you die in your\nboots.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fear that is impossible,\u201d says Ajax. \u201cThe boots belong to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHappy birthday!\u201d yelps Magpie. \u201cThey\u2019re yours, Ajax. Go to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will do my best, sir,\u201d says he, and we watches him going over the\nhills, dragging his rope behind him.\n\n\u201cJust plain crazy, Ike,\u201d declares Magpie. \u201cPlain crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot Ajax,\u201d says I. \u201cNossir! That feller is plumb fancy crazy. He\u2019s\ngilt-edged, perfumed and embroidered, Magpie. He knows a million\ndollars\u2019 worth of things that won\u2019t never do him any good--things\nthat other fellers like him have found out; and now he\u2019s out here to\nfind out something to pass on to them. It won\u2019t never do him nor\nanybody else any good--but they\u2019ll be glad.\u201d\n\n               *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe knocked off work late in the afternoon. I laid down on the bunk\nwhile Magpie fixes a kettle of beans. He\u2019s standing in the door of\nthe cabin, pouring the water off them beans, when all to once there\ncomes a hunk of lead, knocks the kettle out of Magpie\u2019s hand, and\nhives up in the foot of our bunk. Then comes the crack of a rifle.\n\nI sees Magpie elevate his hands, and I slips loose my six-shooter.\nThen here comes \u201cMighty\u201d Jones, covering Magpie with a rifle.\n\nMighty owns the only herd of goats in the county, and each and every\none of them shaggy things is nitroglycerin on legs. I figures that\nMighty has gone crazy from herding same, so when he turns sideways\nto me I slams a .45 slug into the loading-plate of his rifle.\n\nThat slug seems to cause consternation, being as it explodes some of\nMighty\u2019s magazine, and when a magazine full of 45-70s begin to heave\nand surge, it\u2019s no place for a timid person.\n\nMagpie turns a flip-flop into the cabin, and Mighty tries to dig\nhimself into our chip-pile. I pilgrims out there and looks at\nMighty.\n\n\u201cWhy for the hands-up stuff, Mighty?\u201d I asks. \u201cYou peeved?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou dang well know I am! You know why, too--blast you! I only seen\none of you, but you two are pardners, and--I\u2019ll see you in jail. I\u2019m\ngoing to get the sheriff, me!\u201d\n\n\u201cPlain crazy, Ike,\u201d says Magpie sad-like. \u201cPlain crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery plain,\u201d I agrees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you both in jail--betcher life!\u201d wails Mighty. \u201cSure\nwill.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter see a eye doctor, Mighty,\u201d advises Magpie. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing\nthings.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see something--dang you both!\u201d\n\nAnd Mighty fogs off down the trail.\n\n\u201cPoor old coot,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cCan\u2019t help feeling sorry for him,\nIke.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh. He was a good old buggy but he\u2019s done broke down.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo question about the buggy part, Ike.\u201d\n\nWe fixed up our pot of beans and wondered where Ajax is. We ate\nsupper and wondered some more about Ajax.\n\nThen cometh Lindhardt Cadwallader Sims, knowed as \u201cScenery.\u201d We\nalways figured that Scenery was sheriff by default, being as two of\nMagpie\u2019s friends forgot to vote, and Scenery won by one vote. He\u2019s\nabout knee-high to a he-human, and has darned near polished all the\nepitaph off his star in six months. He squeaks when he walks and\nsqueaks when he talks, which makes him a pathetic person among his\nfeller men.\n\nThe danged little imitation has a six-gun in his hand when he shows\nup in our doorway. He peers at us mean-like and clears his throat.\nI\u2019m just about to pour some beans into my plate, but I takes one\nlook at his gun and swings back with that kettle and let her fly. It\nwas a good shot. She just turns over once and hit him right in the\nchin.\n\nHe staggers backward, drops his gun and begins to claw at them\nbeans. Sudden-like he remembers his gun and goes pawing around for\nit. I swings the door about half-shut when I hears a biff and a\ngrunt, and Scenery Sims comes into that door on his hands and knees.\nHe hops to his feet fighting mad, and squeaks like a bull fiddle:\n\n\u201cYou assassinators is all under arrest! Hear me? You can\u2019t monkey\nwith no officer of the peace thataway and get away with it. Magpie,\nyou daw-gonned, long-whiskered----\u201d\n\nMagpie stopped his yelps by picking him up and throwing him out of\nthe door. Scenery was just sailing out as Ajax starts to come in,\nand they met. When an irresistible jackass meets an immovable\neducated fool there is something going on.\n\nThem two misfits of the human race went into a clinch and hugged\neach other like long-lost brothers. They got up fighting blind, went\ninto another clinch and rolled under Scenery\u2019s bronc.\n\nFor a few seconds there ain\u2019t nothing but hoofs, boots and dust to\nbe seen. Then it gets too warm for a buzzard-headed bronc, and said\nanimal leaves its master to fate and an educated fool.\n\nAjax was a lot stronger than he looked. He squirmed loose, grabs the\nsheriff by the neck and the seat of the pants and cast him far away.\n\nPoor Scenery! He rolls over a few times and staggers to his feet. He\nwhales away with both fists at nothing, crosses his feet and falls\ndown again.\n\nThen he gets up and starts off down the road. He walks a few steps\nand then runs a few. Then he does it all over again, like he was\nexpecting a kick in the rear every time he steps.\n\nAjax has set down on the ground and is trying to dig the alkali out\nof his mouth and eyes. He sure is a sight. Me and Magpie walks over\nto him, and Magpie says--\n\n\u201cSay, professor, we\u2019d admire to know if it was you who knocked\nScenery into our cabin.\u201d\n\n\u201cScenery?\u201d\n\nHe peers up at us and then blinks shut again.\n\n\u201cThe general aspect, as regards variety or beauty, or the reverse,\nof a landscape?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy ----!\u201d says I. \u201cHe asked you in a lady-like manner: Who knocked\nScenery into our cabin? The man you fought. _Sabe?_\u201d\n\n\u201cThe--the man I fought?\u201d stutters Ajax. \u201cDid I--I fight a man?\u201d\n\n\u201cSay,\u201d says Magpie, \u201cdid you get hit so hard that you don\u2019t _sabe_\nthings? What did you think you was mopping the earth with?\u201d\n\n\u201cI--er--really----\u201d Ajax mops some more dirt out of his features and\npeers around-- \u201cI--er--suppose I must take your unsupported word for\nit, but I--I thought at the time that I was being attacked by a\nspecimen of the genus Ovius.\u201d\n\nMagpie kicks the empty bean-kettle into the cabin, and me and him\nfollers it inside. Pretty soon Ajax looks in. He peers all around\nand then begins to search outside.\n\nMe and Magpie went out there and looked around, too. Then Ajax\nstarts circling the cabin, and me and Magpie follered him like a\npair of bird-dog pups follering an old dog, but we don\u2019t find\nanything. Pretty soon Ajax sighs deep-like.\n\n\u201cWell, it isn\u2019t here, it seems.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe you lost it some other place,\u201d suggests Magpie.\n\n\u201cNo. I had it when I arrived.\u201d\n\n\u201c----!\u201d grunts Magpie. \u201cWhat was it, Ajax?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe--er--specimen of the genus Ovius.\u201d\n\nI grabs Magpie just in time. Ajax never did know how close he\nskidded to the graveyard that time. Magpie was so mad that he\nwouldn\u2019t come into the cabin while I throws a feed into Ajax.\n\n\u201cThere should be a drastic legislation against the careless use of\nfirearms,\u201d states Ajax. \u201cWould you believe it--\u201d he pokes a fork at\nme like he was trying to see if I was done--\u201csome careless person,\nevidently shooting at random, nearly struck me? I was a little south\nof here, returning with my specimen, when I detected a singing noise\npast my ear. Immediately following came the report of a firearm.\n\n\u201cIn endeavoring to ascertain the location of the miscreant I became\nentangled with my specimen, and luckily we fell into a depression\nbehind an outcropping of granite formation. Luckily the depression\nwas filled with a thick growth of mimosaceous shrub, which screened\nus from view.\n\n\u201cI feel sure that the target was located upon or near that granite\noutcropping, because in a few minutes I could hear the marksman\ncarrying on a conversation like this, omitting the vulgarity, of\ncourse:\n\n\u201c\u2018Pshaw! Missed entirely!\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd then he seemed heartily ashamed of himself, as he said:\n\n\u201c\u2018Too bad! I should have had higher aspirations.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe last may not be correct, but at any rate he mentioned something\nabout holding higher, which amounts to the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d says I; \u201che was careless, Ajax. I feel sorry for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps I should have extended my sympathy,\u201d says Ajax.\n\u201cBut--er--really I was in no position to think of the niceties of\nsocial custom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was you doing all this time?\u201d asks Magpie from the doorway.\n\n\u201cI--er--I was trying to preserve my hold upon the Ovius.\u201d\n\n               *       *       *       *       *\n\nI seen Magpie walk out about fifty feet, throw his hat on the ground\nand hop up and down on it. This Ovius is getting under his hide.\n\n\u201cI will persevere,\u201d says Ajax determined-like. \u201cI must persevere.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, Percy,\u201d says I. \u201cDon\u2019t let us stop you.\u201d\n\nMe and Magpie talked things over, but we can\u2019t figure it out.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the ---- of it, Ike,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cIf Ajax was a human\nbeing he could tell us what he\u2019s after, but education has plumb\nruined him for conversation. I reckon we\u2019ve got to give him plenty\nof rope, and he\u2019ll hang up some place.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s used up enough rope to hang all the rustlers in Montana,\u201d says\nI. \u201cHe had one specimen, Magpie, but somebody shot at him----\u201d\n\n\u201cRotten shooting!\u201d snorts Magpie. \u201cThere is such things as mob law,\nand if he don\u2019t give us a chance to see what he\u2019s after I\u2019m going to\nturn myself into a mob and make him talk something we can _sabe_.\n\n\u201cWhat in ---- is a Ovius? As far as I can remember there ain\u2019t never\nbeen one seen here. None of the old-timers has ever spoke of any\nsuch a thing, Ike. There ain\u2019t nothing in the Injun language that\nsounds like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says I, \u201cwhat is astragalas splendens?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere you are!\u201d\n\nMagpie waves his arms and walks in a circle.\n\n\u201cThere you are, Ike. Both of us holds a blank hand, so we just\nsplits the pot. I reckon I\u2019ll likely kill Ajax tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd never find out what he\u2019s after?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are things better left unknown, Ike. Let\u2019s go to bed before\nwe mention something that we can\u2019t explain.\u201d\n\nAjax is writing in his little book by the light of a candle, and\nwhen we come in he stops.\n\n\u201cPardon me,\u201d says he to Magpie. \u201cHas anything ever been written\nregarding the hipwiggler?\u201d\n\n\u201cNun-not that I knows about. It ain\u2019t what you\u2019d call popular.\u201d\n\nHe thinks it over for a while, and then he sort of says to himself:\n\n\u201cIt could be named after me. What an honor!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2019m,\u201d admits Magpie. \u201cYou can be a father to it if you want to.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I could only secure a specimen!\u201d he wails. \u201cI must! I will!\u201d\n\nHe hops off his seat and walks up and down the cabin.\n\n\u201cYou spoke of something about securing one by making a noise like\na--a----\u201d\n\n\u201cLoofmad?\u201d asks Magpie.\n\n\u201cExactly. A loofmad. Is it a--er--difficult sound to make?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope. Easy for lots of folks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you mind giving me a demonstration?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot me. I did once, and I almost got killed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh! Is it dangerous?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is and it ain\u2019t. You\u2019d be safe, Ajax.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you teach me?\u201d\n\nAjax stops in front of Magpie and holds out his hands like Magpie\nhad something to give him.\n\n\u201cTeach you? Man, you\u2019re born to it. No, I can\u2019t tell you how to do\nit, but the proper note is in your voice every little while, only\nyou don\u2019t know it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it a gift?\u201d asks Ajax.\n\n\u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d explodes Magpie. \u201cIf it is I hope nobody knows\nwhen my birthday is, and that Sandy Claws goes blind.\u201d\n\n\u201cInteresting but vague,\u201d says Ajax, and goes back to his book.\n\nYes, Ajax slept with his feet in the air again.\n\nMe and Magpie talks over the events of the day, but we can\u2019t figure\nit out. We can\u2019t figure why Mighty wishes to hold us up, and why he\nsends Scenery up there with blood in his eye. We asks Ajax the next\nmorning if he\u2019s done anything wrong, but he shakes his head.\n\n\u201cI never have done anything wrong,\u201d says he.\n\n\u201cThis is a great little country to establish a precedent,\u201d says\nMagpie. \u201cA herder of goats comes here yesterday and shoots a\nbean-pot out of my hands. Later on the sheriff comes up--but you\nknow that. Do you know why they comes here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t an idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you ain\u2019t, but I thought maybe you had a hunch.\u201d\n\nAjax got himself a rope this time. He hunted around until he found\nan old sack, and then he sets down to look in his little book.\n\n\u201cToday,\u201d says he, \u201cI am going to make a supreme effort to secure\nvaluable data, and I wish to ask a few questions. Is the hipwiggler\na vegetarian or of the carnivora, and what is its habitat?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hipwiggler,\u201d says Magpie, \u201ceats anything and is fond of\nchildren. It is of the hootchie-kootchie family. Hootchie, meaning\nhip, and kootchie, meaning to wiggle. The great difference between\nit and anything else is in its shape, size, actions, color and\nodor.\u201d\n\n\u201cHootchie-kootchie?\u201d asks Ajax. \u201cIs that--er--an Indian word?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh. The Camelpunchers.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas the hipwiggler a distinctive odor?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou dang well know it has. You look for something that you never\nseen nor smelled before. _Sabe?_ Catch it and bring it here, and if\nit ain\u2019t a hipwiggler we\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see. We will have an elimination proceedings.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody will be, that\u2019s a cinch,\u201d grins Magpie.\n\nAjax tightens the rope around his waist, picks up his sack and faces\nthe east.\n\n\u201cI gird up my loins and fare forth. Today I will complete my quest.\nI bid you good morning, gentlemen.\u201d\n\nWe watches the blamed fool pilgrim across the hills.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to admire him for sticking,\u201d says I, but Magpie snorts:\n\n\u201cYeah? Might as well give three cheers for a cactus, Ike.\u201d\n\n               *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201cDoughgod\u201d Smith comes past about dinner-time and stops to smoke a\ncigaret.\n\n\u201cSeen a posse today,\u201d grins Doughgod. \u201cSome bunch. Scenery Sims,\nMighty Jones and Doleful Doolittle. Put them three on a two-by-four\nisland and they couldn\u2019t find each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did you see \u2019em, Doughgod?\u201d asks Magpie.\n\n\u201cThey left town about an hour before I started. Pointed towards\nMighty\u2019s place.\u201d\n\nDoughgod rode on, and me and Magpie ponders things. That\u2019s some\nposse to go after anybody. Pretty soon Magpie sniffs the air. I\nsniff a little too, and then we hear Scenery Sims\u2019 squeaky voice.\n\n\u201cHalt! You darn fool--halt!\u201d\n\nWe steps around the corner of the cabin and sees a queer sight. In\nthe middle of the trail stands Ajax. Standing between his long legs\nis a goat--a sick-looking goat.\n\nAjax has got the sack over his shoulder, and when he sees us he\nswings it to the ground.\n\nAbove him on the hill is Scenery with a rifle in his hands, and\nabout sixty feet behind Ajax is Mighty, hanging on to his nose.\nBelow Ajax, standing on the side of the hill with a rock in each\nhand, is Doleful.\n\n\u201cStand still, dog-gone you!\u201d squeaks Scenery. \u201cYou\u2019re under arrest!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is all very peculiar,\u201d says Ajax sick-like. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\nit all means, and I----\u201d\n\nAjax picks up his sack and starts for us.\n\n\u201cStop him, Magpie!\u201d yelps Scenery. \u201cShoot the darn fool!\u201d\n\nAjax stops and looks foolish.\n\n\u201cWill somebody explain things?\u201d asks Magpie, holding his nose.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a thief,\u201d says Scenery. \u201cCaught with the goods, too. He stole\nthet goat from Mighty Jones.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says I, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you arrest him, Scenery? He ain\u2019t\nheeled.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot me! I don\u2019t want him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI demand his arrest!\u201d yelps Mighty.\n\n\u201cShut up, Mighty!\u201d squeaks Scenery. \u201cHe\u2019s been arrested five\nminutes; ain\u2019t you, feller?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mentioned such a proceeding,\u201d admits Ajax.\n\n\u201cThe law is satisfied.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you got in the sack, Ajax?\u201d I yells.\n\n\u201cI am not sure, but I think it is a hipwiggler.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe tried to steal my sheep,\u201d stated Doleful. \u201cHe assaulted me\nand----\u201d\n\n\u201cHipwiggler ----!\u201d snorts Mighty. \u201cHe\u2019s got a polecat in that sack.\nHim and that goat are inoculated against any smell from now on and\nforever. Amen.\u201d\n\nAjax stands there and looks foolish. He can\u2019t smell nothing. There\nis such a thing as getting too much. The goat swallers hard and\nleans against Ajax. I feel sorry for the goat.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cyou might as well take your goat, Mighty.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot me!\u201d yells Mighty. \u201cI\u2019m off that goat forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s sort of a deadlock,\u201d says I. \u201cAjax is arrested in name\nonly and the owner of the stolen property refuses to take it back.\u201d\n\nJust then Judge Steele rides in from the mine. We explains things to\nhim, and he looks wise.\n\n\u201cClean case against him, judge,\u201d states Scenery. \u201cHe\u2019s got the goods\non him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink I can\u2019t smell?\u201d snorts the judge. \u201cThis is an open-air case.\u201d\n\nHe pounds on his saddle-horn.\n\n\u201cHear ye, hear ye, hear ye! This honorable court is doing business.\nThe prisoner will stay where he is. Are you guilty or not guilty?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d says Ajax weary-like.\n\n\u201cPrisoner, does that goat belong to Mighty Jones?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cCall it and see if it comes to you, Mighty,\u201d suggests Magpie.\n\n\u201cLike ----!\u201d\n\n\u201cLet the goat loose and see who it goes to,\u201d suggests the judge.\n\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d yelps Mighty. \u201cDon\u2019t do that! I don\u2019t know how he ever got\nthe rope on it, but I do know it\u2019s the champion butter of the world.\nYou stick with it, feller, and get time off for good behavior.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the same one I had yesterday,\u201d states Ajax. \u201cIt--er--struck\nthe sheriff, I believe.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaw! haw! haw!\u201d whoops Magpie. \u201cIt upset our sheriff something\nawful.\u201d\n\nWe considers things for a while, and then the judge says:\n\n\u201cAccording to my own reckoning there ain\u2019t nothing to be done, but I\nhas to pass an opinion. Being as the prisoner, smelling as he does,\nis of no value to the prosecution, and the plaintiff refuses to take\nback his alleged property, I adjudicates thusly:\n\n\u201cThe prisoner will be banished on his own recognizance. Feller, you\nbetter go away off some place. _Sabe?_ Take your clothes and burn\n\u2019em and jump in the river or vicy versy. Given under my hand and\nseal this fifth day of August in the year of our Lord, and the\nCounty of Yaller Rock.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019d admire why a freak like that does things like he\u2019s done?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was desirous of observing the effects of astragalas splendens on\nthe genus Ovius.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ---- you was!\u201d snorts the judge. \u201cFind out?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I was almost prepared for the experiment when this unforeseen\ncontingency arose.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy ----!\u201d grunts Magpie. \u201cHe was sure going to do something awful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is nothing to----\u201d\n\nAjax dropped his rope and stooped to pick it up; and didn\u2019t finish\nhis sentence, \u2019cause that goat hit him dead center and Ajax and his\nsack turned a cartwheel. The polecat came out of the sack and\ntangled with the goat, and then both of them started back down the\ntrail towards Mighty.\n\nMighty must \u2019a\u2019 got his property back, \u2019cause as far as we can see\n\u2019em Mighty is still in the lead, but it\u2019s almost a cinch the goat\nwill win out in the end.\n\nAjax watches \u2019em for a minute and then starts for the cabin.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d snaps Magpie. \u201cI\u2019ll get your belongings for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am going away,\u201d says Ajax sad-like; \u201cgoing where intellect is\nappreciated. I came here on a scientific mission, and I find that\nresearch work is not appreciated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe may not be strong for you, Ajax, but it\u2019s a cinch you\u2019re too\nstrong for us,\u201d says Magpie, tossing the valise to Ajax.\n\n\u201cGood-by, Ajax,\u201d says I. \u201cTell Middleton hello for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall tell him something for myself,\u201d says he, picking up his\nvalise. \u201cMost surely I shall speak to Middleton about you both.\u201d\n\nWe watches him pilgrim down the trail, exuding odors of which there\nis no imitation.\n\n\u201cMagpie,\u201d says the judge, \u201chave you any idea what he wanted?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot in my language, judge. I\u2019m going to write to Professor\nMiddleton and ask him what it is. I reckon Ajax came to the wrong\nplace.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me know, Magpie,\u201d squeaks Scenery. \u201cI\u2019d admire to hear what it\nwas.\u201d\n\nWe didn\u2019t hear no more about Ajax, and about three weeks later we\u2019re\ndown at Piperock and got a letter from Middleton. We got Scenery,\nand the three of us went up to Judge Steele\u2019s office.\n\nMagpie opens the letter and reads it aloud to us:\n\n    Dear Magpie and Ike:\n\n    Professor Green returned. Tell me about the thing he\n    calls a hipwiggler. He dropped some information to\n    Pettingill regarding it, but refuses even to nod to me.\n    In fact he is very reticent over the whole matter.\n\n    He started to tell Pettingill about the \u201cloofmad.\u201d\n    Pettingill wrote it out and happened to spell it\n    backward. Now Green won\u2019t speak to Pettingill. Please\n    tell us why a vigilance committee in Silver Bend made\n    him burn his clothes, which by the way contained his\n    money. We are very anxious to hear all about it.\n\n    You ask the meaning of Green\u2019s statement--to study the\n    effects of astragalas splendens on the genus Ovius.\n\nMagpie\u2019s lips move slow-like over it, and then he hands the letter\nto us. The three of us bends over it and reads where he left off:\n\n    He meant that he wished to study the effects of\n    loco-weed on sheep.\n\nThe four of us leans back against the wall and look at each other.\n\n\u201cMagpie,\u201d says the judge, clearing his throat and brushing off his\nvest, \u201cMagpie, what do you think of too much education?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn a par with astragalas splendens, judge.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo which,\u201d says the judge, \u201cI will say, \u2018_E pluribus unum._\u2019\u201d\n\nAll of which might be true, but Ajax was our first example.\n\n\n                               The End",
