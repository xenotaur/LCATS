    "body": "Fred Kirr, stomach twisting with shock, turned from the viewscreen and\nlooked directly into the deep blue eyes of the girl. \"Would you repeat\nthat?\" he asked, fighting to keep urgency from his voice.\n\nOrdinarily, JoAnn Chase's eyes danced merrily in tune with her\nvivacious personality; now, however, they were filled with an inner\nlight akin to fanaticism, and Fred felt his scalp crawl. Without taking\nher eyes from the planet, in a hypnotic-like state, Jo answered, \"I\njust said, 'Oh, my God!'\"\n\n\"I know,\" Fred interjected hastily. \"We were in complete agreement up\nto that point. But what did you say next?\"\n\n\"It's indescribably lovely, heavenly! Compared to it, Earth is a\ndesiccated old hag, a vapid, colorless rock that tediously circles the\nsun.\"\n\nFred thought silently: When we left Earth, a few days ago, you looked\nback and called her a blue-green jewel. Then, to check himself, he\nlooked once more at the planet, even now perceptibly larger in the\ncenter of the screen. Heavenly? Far from it, a diametric opposite,\nfor he still saw in it a face that might have been dredged from the\nnightmare horror of his unconscious. It was a face from hell, and he\ncouldn't shake the impression. Even if he wanted to be dispassionate\nin evaluation, he'd still have to call the cancerous blob a desert\nplanet....\n\n\"Jo!\" Fred's call was a plea for help, \"I've got to speak to you--\"\n\nThe girl interrupted with an impatient shake of her blonde locks,\nput a finger to her lips. For a moment, Fred was reminded of a small\nboy being quieted during the Sunday sermon. His confusion and fear\ncame boiling out as aggression. After all, this _was_ only a\nplanet; Jo hadn't the right to make it a religious ceremony. He stamped\naway ... but soon was wrestling with the problem again; Fred was too\nwell trained in the scientific method not to. Given: two reasonably\ncompetent observers. Event: a planet that the expedition had set out\nto find. Descriptions: completely opposite. Conclusion: well, what? Is\nsanity to be questioned? Whose? And be honest with yourself. Add the\novertones of what could be emotional involvement with a girl you've\nonly recently met.\n\n\n\nFred was surprised to find himself in the ship's control center. The\nhugeness of Captain John Charlesworth was bent over a star chart.\nCharlesworth was a big, solid man who loved living. He had taught\nFred practically everything there was to know about operating the\nship--with automation being what it was, he was able to do it in the\nthree days they'd been traveling. The two men were friends from the\ntime they'd been introduced, so perhaps it wasn't strange that Fred\nshould be here.\n\n\"John,\" Fred began without preamble, \"there's something about that\nplanet--\"\n\nCharlesworth's face split into a grin. \"There sure is! Beauty, isn't\nshe? Thought you'd like it. If we find life, it'll be there.\"\n\nFred was caught short. It was another strike against him. Some instinct\nwarned him to be quiet, and he left as soon as he could. \"Curiouser and\ncuriouser,\" he mused, then reached a decision. He had a purpose now.\n\nThe other two members of the expedition were also watching the\napproach to the planet. Fred found them in the recreation area.\nRichard Lodgesen, the lean, tall chemist-physicist, looked up at\nFred's approach, said with a supercilious air, \"I should think the\nanthropology section would be studying the planet as hard as we.\"\n\n\n\nData, Fred, data! Ignore the jerk; just integrate this information: he\nwas easily distracted. \"I _am_ studying. What do you think of it?\"\n\nLodgesen smiled warmly, the first time he'd reacted pleasantly around\nFred. \"I think we're all of the same opinion. This discovery will rock\n'em up back home.\"\n\n\"And you, Beth?\"\n\nBeth Rosen, their data coordinator, _Huh?ed_, and gave Fred her\nattention grudgingly. \"My opinion? It's ... it's like coming home,\nFred. Why do you ask?\"\n\nOf them all, Beth was the only one who was curious about Fred's\nactivities. \"No important reason,\" he was suddenly aware of a bead of\nsweat on his forehead as he looked at the screen. Home? More like the\npoorhouse. But he continued to lie, \"Just doing a little survey.\" He\nwandered away, thoughts in turmoil.\n\nHe must be careful of Beth. He'd learned very fast to respect her on\nboth professional and interpersonal grounds. The gal had a mind like a\nsteel trap; she had a body that caused males--adolescents to elders--to\nfantasy, and females--of _any_ age--to envy. Beth, as data coordinator,\nhad a role on the ground similar to Charlesworth's in space. Although\nthe data coordinator rarely went to extremes, she or he was fed all\ninformation the expedition collected, had ultimate power for decision\nand responsibility.\n\nAnd how was Fred to give her this information? Add it up--but it\nwouldn't add. JoAnn Chase, semantics, deeply taken with the planet;\nBeth Rosen, data coordinator, in a state of lassitude but not\nas strongly influenced as Jo; John Charlesworth, captain, highly\nenthusiastic; Richard Lodgesen, chemistry-physics, showing more joyous\nemotion than the cold fish could possibly be expected to; and Fred\nKirr, anthropology, who tended as far toward dislike as Beth did like,\npossibly as far as Jo.\n\nItem: no one acted abnormal.\n\nItem: on the basis of very bad statistical sampling, it seemed the\nwomen were reacting far more than the men to this particular encounter.\n\nItem: you, Fred Kirr, are the only one to have an anti-reaction.\nAre you insane? No, you've always been this way. In school, the\ntimes you got good grades were when you were sure you'd flunked. Or,\ntake your Tanganyika discovery in 1965: a complete skeleton of the\nDryopithecinae, showing anthropoid differentiation by late Miocene.\nThe scientific world hailed this as strong evidence that, in _Life's_\nwords, \"the evolution of that primate called 'man' began fantastically\nfarther back than we'd ever before dreamed.\" Your reaction was\ndiscouragement; there was too much conclusion jumping; nothing at all\nhad been proved.\n\nCome to think of it, all 28 of your years have been spent with reverse\nreaction. And now you have a situation that must soon be resolved.\n\n\n\nFred shook his head. The change in the others seemed so sudden. It was\nonly a few hours ago that the ship had come out of hyper.\n\nHe'd been watching the newly visible star system wondering, Will you be\nthe one? Somewhere in your depths, is there the key to our mystery?\n\n\"Hi, Gloomy Gus!\" JoAnn joined him, excited pleasure bubbling from her.\n\n\"Gloomy--\"\n\n\"All right, you weren't being gloomy, just concentrating. You're still\nknown to the rest of us as Gloomy Gus....\" She giggled.\n\n\"I was thinking about intelligent life,\" Fred said.\n\n\"I'll bet,\" the girl added, \"you were thinking I wouldn't have a job\nbecause, as usual, we won't find it. But we're _bound_ to, eventually,\nso why not now?\"\n\nHe had to smile; her attitude was infectious. \"Matter of fact, I _was_\nthinking we'd miss. I even wonder what we're doing out here--\"\n\nCharlesworth's voice, on the intercom, broke in: \"Attention, please. We\nhave come out of hyperspace in the constellation Taurus. As you know,\nnothing has been said about our destination; this is done to avoid\nprejudicing you. I'll now play the recorded instructions from General\nAnderson.\"\n\nA new voice took over, sounding even more mechanical. \"Ladies and\ngentlemen, you are making history. Whatever you do will make history,\nUnited States' history--\"\n\nFred, the only member who'd been out before, said, \"They always begin\nthat way. You'd think--\"\n\nJo shooshed him, and they continued listening. \"This expedition is one\nof the many under the administration of the National Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration and coordinated by the joint armed forces. You\nare aboard the Exploration Frigate DLE 560, also known as USS Taurus.\nThe general volume of space around you is the Taurus moving cluster,\na roughly globular group of 100 stars. Your destination is the Hyades\nopen cluster, specifically Gamma Tauri.\n\n\"Your primary mission is, as always, to find and contact intelligent\nlife. However, secondarily, you may be able to shed some light on the\nphenomenon we call 'moving clusters.' These are ill-defined groups of\nstars, all in parallel motion.\n\n\"Taurus is moving away from us at 28.5 miles per second. Now 130 light\nyears away, the group was closest to us--some 65 light years--only 800\nthousand years ago....\"\n\nFred stopped listening. Why, that long ago, man was already\ndifferentiated. In another half-million years, more or less, the\ngang around the old juke box in Java would be using fire ... only\nhe wouldn't really be man, just an unreasonable facsimile. Man? He\nwouldn't show up for another 450 millennia--too soon, too soon.\nSomething's got to be done about our theories: in 25,000 years, we\nappeared as a clever savage, developed to our present state. What were\nwe doing in all the years the lower hominids were evolving? Where were\nwe?\n\nNo matter. In 25,000 years, we haven't had a chance to mature. Because\nof political pressure, DLE 560 is out into the universe, trying to\nbefriend other intelligences. And so are a host of other peoples from\nEarth: peoples who owe their allegiance to imaginary lines on Earth's\nsurface. Suppose we do make contact? Can we--man, that is--handle the\njob? _Have_ we matured? Why are we here?\n\n\n\nThe learning curve is exponential. It took man nearly 50 years to\ngo from Jenny to jet, from Kittyhawk to Canaveral. It took him\nlittle more than a decade to go from _Titan_ to transcontinuum, from\nexploring Earth to exploring the universe. And man being a contrary,\ncontumacious, cockeyed Cat, it wasn't a good thing, Man.\n\nThere were some cynics who thought it was the most miserable thing\nthat could happen to the universe. They based this on the shrieking\nambivalence man displayed in the total course of events, primarily\nbad, he'd created and lived through. He began meekly enough. Hunted\nand planted and found a little leisure. With that commodity, he set up\nspecial caves and began to paint, to sculpture, to philosophize.\n\nThen he changed. Maybe it was the cold draughts in the caves, maybe\nit was the old lady complaining about the draughts, or maybe it was\nplain frustration: he'd been trying, for a couple of thousand years,\nto invent writing and had failed. In any event, man was suddenly\ndifferent. He found that scrambled brains--his neighbor's--were good\neating. Ever the artist, he enjoyed the color of blood much more than\nthose dull old mineral pigments. If a couple of the guys sneaked up\nbehind a herd of horses and suddenly scared them, what fun! The whole\nherd would stampede off a cliff.\n\nAesthetic? Certainly. He went back into the caves and tried his\nhand at dirty pictures; had to give that up, though, until he\ninvented plain brown envelopes and photography. Anyway, he'd lost\nthe touch ... except in one area. These products were works of art, a\ndelight to behold: man was making the damnedest, finest arrowheads and\nspear points he'd ever seen.\n\nShe, who may have jerked him out of the cave in the beginning,\ncontinued to warm her feet on his back, with the result that he'd go\nout and knock over a country rich in coal deposits. She didn't really\nlike it, but she was stuck with it. Certainly, she was carrying out\nher function. If there were a war or two too many, she could always up\nproduction--having discovered how well before they set up cave-keeping.\nThe flutter of an eyelash or an exposed ankle ... she carried out her\nfunction, and the population kept rising.\n\n\n\nBy the opening of the twentieth century, however, she'd grown\napprehensive. Man was playing with bigger and bigger boom-boom toys.\nShe tried to exert control, discovered too late it was out of her\nhands. For one day, man brought home the keenest, ginger-peachiest job\nof them all. Like maybe he could blow himself to hell with an atomic\nbomb.\n\nElders had shaken their heads over it; youngsters had joined them when\nthe fusion bomb came next. And the world settled down to hold its\nbreath while the two leading powers fenced economically--with Russia\nthrusting and the U. S. parrying.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, two other nations appeared on the world scene--rather,\nreappeared. Great Britain, at one time the strongest nation, in one\nstroke became the richest: Britain, of necessity, for years had been\nresearching magnetohydrodynamics in an effort to get controlled fusion.\nWhile the two \"leading\" powers were threatening one another, the\nBritish engineered practical atomics and had energy to burn, if the\nphrase will be excused.\n\nAnd then there was France. Long influential in world history, this\nsmall country was reduced by two wars to a minor position. France had\nat one time been the seat of scientific progress in the world. The\nFrench regained status when they got antigravity. Zwicky, at Cal Tech,\nhad long ago shown that the effect of gravity occurred either twice or\none-half the speed of light. Apparently no one paid much attention,\nexcept for a few obscure French philosophers.\n\nAnd so, in the course of eight months in 1964-1965, the focus of power\nin the world again shifted to the English Channel. Of course, these\ndevelopments were secret. If the U. S. and U. S. S. R. were left with\ntheir tongues hanging out, they didn't realize it. But not for long.\nYou just can't keep things like that secret. And man being what he\nis....\n\nThe French were spying on the British; the British on the Russians; the\nRussians on the United States; and the U. S. was spying on all three.\n\nAntigravity had its limits. With it, you could never exceed light\nspeed because you were confined to the physical, Einsteinian universe.\nWhat was needed was raw energy to warp the continuum, fold it like a\npiece of paper, and punch a hole through it as a short cut. That's\nwhere controlled fusion came in. And even though it required tons of\nequipment, antigravity made it possible to get those tons off the\nground.\n\nBy 1970, the four powers were racing to explore the universe. If\nanything, relations between them were worse. All gave lip service to\nthe noble idea of finding intelligent life; actually, the world knew\nthat the first nation to find such life would be enlisting a powerful\nally, creating a shift in power that might mean control.\n\nThere were exceptions. Take Russia, who'd brought the Red Chinese along\ntoo fast. As many had predicted as far back as 1941, the U. S. S. R.\nwas now trying to play footsie with the West. Unfortunately, there no\nlonger was a West as such. Each was to its own. So the world groaned\nunder a new burden when it was rumored that the Chinese were working on\ntheir first transcontinuum ship.\n\nWith the power of fusion at his command, man had everything he could\npossibly want. But it had come too soon; he was unaware. Instead, he\nwent into space looking for intelligence equal to or greater than his\nown, looking for a new club to use against his neighbors on Earth.\nMan, the cynics said, was too immature, would destroy himself before\n1980--himself and the life he's trying to find. The cynics were in\noverwhelming preponderance. Yet a few voices were raised in hope: Don't\nlet this throw you, but is it possible that the artist-philosopher had\nagain come to the fore?\n\n\n\nThe shift in the others had seemed abrupt to Fred. They were far more\ninterested in that damned planet than in him; this should have been\nperfectly natural except for the speed of occurrence.\n\nAs the only space veteran, Fred was listened to carefully. Further,\nas the anthropologist, he was in a position to tell them things they\nwanted to know.\n\nSoon after they'd come out of hyper, the group gathered in the\nrecreation area. In the three days of the trip, they'd grown used to\nmeeting there for discussion. And this time, they were excited about\nthe possibility of life.\n\n\"Somehow,\" Jo said, \"I feel that _we_ are destined to do what none of\nthe others has done.\"\n\nThere was general concurrence. \"Right!\" Charlesworth interjected.\n\nFred frowned, shook his head.\n\n\"Why not? How can you know, Kirr?\" Lodgesen, as usual, was his snobbish\nself.\n\n\"Why not? You ought to know more than I about randomness and screwed-up\nstatistics, Lodgesen.\" Fred was on his feet for emphasis. \"Frankly,\nfrom what we've learned out here, I'd rather count on winning the\nsweepstakes ... without having a ticket. That's how bad the odds are.\"\n\n\"Fred,\" Beth said softly, \"we concede you know your business; and you\nwere on two other expeditions that found traces of very high orders of\nintelligence on deserted planets. But why do you feel so strongly? I\nshould think those traces would be encouraging.\"\n\nAgain he shook his head. \"It's not that simple. Here's the run-down:\nfive years ago we began sending out expeditions. So did the other\ncountries. Naturally, we tried the stars nearest us; so did they.\nWe've very effectively covered the nearest parts of the galaxy. No\nlife.\"\n\n\"But evidence of it,\" Lodgesen objected. \"Counting all extinct cultures\nfound by the various powers, I'd guess the total is upwards of 10 or\n11.\"\n\nFred smiled humorously. \"The total is _47_ finds; for some reason, no\none is telling all. Security. Fortunately, Dr. Kousansky is a good\nfriend of mine, and Professeur de Poitiers is a friend of his, and so\non down the line.\n\n\"We're guessing, of course, but it seems our little corner of the\nuniverse is deserted. A more profitable question than _where?_ is\n_why?_ You might also be interested in the times involved; they're\nlengthy enough to cause head scratching. Wendell, at London University,\ncame up with the oldest--some 585 thousand years, based on radioactive\ndating, but he won't guarantee the figure any closer than +/- 50\nthousand. And the French, as you know, were the first out; de Poitiers\ndid a very thorough job on Alpha Centauri IV. Until 30 thousand years\nago, give or take, she had a thriving little community. I don't think\nyou're going to find intelligent life this close, even within 500 light\nyears. To me, the wonder is why we're here at all when everyone else\nhas left.\"\n\nThere it was. He'd let them have it between the eyes, and they resented\nit. From that time on, he was something of a pariah. Even Jo seemed\nto be ignoring him. The nearer they came to planetfall, the worse it\ngot. At least she lost that look of inner truth, but she was terribly,\nterribly busy. For what? Obviously, preparing for what they should find.\n\nThe USS Taurus circled the planet, Gamma Tauri II. As Fred had\nexpected, it seemed a negative quantity, just another of those hunks of\ncosmic mediocrity. By the third trip, he was completely convinced this\nthing had evolved nothing. He was more relieved than he cared to admit;\nnow Charlesworth would go on. There were more promising planets in the\nsystem.\n\nHe'd spent the last hour writing his report--NASA/DD Form E-72, Rev.\nB in triplicate--when it occurred to him that Charlesworth had made\nno announcement. Fred went to the captain's cabin, found Beth in\ndiscussion with him.\n\n\"Glad you're here; we want to talk something over,\" Charlesworth said.\nThere was a pause, and Fred, watching the other two, felt as though he\nwere an intruder.\n\n\"Sure,\" he said, dropping into a chair.\n\n\"You're sort of strait-laced, but rules are made to be broken....\"\nCharlesworth's voice trailed off.\n\nBeth came directly to the point: \"We all want to land on New Earth.\"\n\n_New Earth!_ Fred was stunned but managed to keep silent.\n\n\"Sure,\" Charlesworth beamed, a big happy bear, \"that way you get a\ncouple of days vacation at government expense, and no one's the wiser.\"\n\nFred shrugged, trying to appear normal. \"I don't see anything wrong\nwith it.\" Hardly aware of his words, he was thinking rapidly. Why\nconvince me? Have the four of them sensed my attitude?\n\n\"There could be something so right with it!\" Beth added. \"If it turns\nout to be what it seems, we'll take the news home. You don't find many\nplanets like this--\"\n\n_You sure don't!_ The young anthropologist gripped the chair arms,\nagain swept by nausea. He was sure he hadn't thought that or said it.\nWas he hearing voices? Neither Beth nor John seemed to notice. He had\nto get out of there, caught in a sudden claustrophobic nightmare.\n\n\"I don't need any convincing,\" he said, hoping it sounded convincing.\n\"I'm ready for that vacation right now. Good night.\" Drenched with\nsweat, he stumbled from the cabin.\n\nDuring the next few days, Fred went through a series of emotional\noscillations the like of which he'd never experienced. He'd nosedive\ninto the pit of depression; when he landed, he found himself atop the\npeak of Mount Euphoria. Finally, however, he came to an important\nconclusion. If he were ready for the squirrel factory, he'd wait until\nthe DLE 560 returned to Earth. He certainly didn't feel violent, so\nhe'd be crazy like a fox and keep his mouth shut.\n\nHe was amazed at the adaptability of the human psyche, for there were\nthree most-probable alternatives to face: he was mentally ill, the\nother four were ditto, or all of them were. Facing that, he could be\nquite calm. He doubted but didn't discount the possibility that they\nwere all sane.\n\n\n\nAfter two days of self-imposed exile, he came out of his cabin. His\nrelations with the opposition--how easily he fell into the term!--were\npolite but strained. Except Lodgesen. The two men, never cordial, now\nfell into a state of cold war, characterized chiefly by refusal to\nspeak. This was the only open rupture.\n\nFred began to help them, to join their somewhat frenetic activities.\nApparently each was engaged in exploration, bringing back to the ship\nsamples of soil, rocks, vegetation, and the like. However, he was never\ninvited to go with them, and as time passed, he found it harder and\nharder to reach them.\n\nJoAnn was his last link. Perhaps it was the feeling of rapport they'd\nhad on the journey out here--or perhaps it was simply that she felt\nsorry for his present state. In any event, Jo would talk freely to him.\n\n\n\nIt was late in the evening of the sixth day. Jo was showing him the\nsamples they'd collected a few hours earlier. The recreation area had\nbeen hastily converted into a sort of museum. In it, the exhibit had\ngrown to an impressive pile ... of junk. But Jo was vivacious enough to\nmake a mummy jump, and he enjoyed listening to her.\n\n\"Don't you see, Fred? We've got huge amounts of data; New Earth is\na paradise, rich in everything we could possibly want. This is the\nplace where our peoples will want to come. We'll be hailed for this\ndiscovery!\"\n\nFor a moment, as she spoke, he did see through her eyes: the place man\nhad always dreamt of. This Eden abounded in game, in forests drained\nby sparkling brooks. All of the riches were here; animal, vegetable,\nmineral wealth were so plentiful that ... _that the streets were paved\nwith gold_, he thought sourly, as the vision faded. No, it was just a\ncommon planet, undistinguished.\n\n\"Why don't we go home, Jo, and tell them?\"\n\nThe blonde lost her sparkle, became blank. As though she hadn't heard\nhis question, she cast about nervously, picked up a rock.\n\n\"Look at this!\" She was enthusiastic again. \"Uranium! Dick Lodgesen has\nbeen analyzing ores. He says the place is fantastically rich in heavy\nminerals.\"\n\nFred turned the specimen in his hand. It was dense quartzite. Heavy\nenough, but it lacked the other characteristics.\n\n\"What makes you think it isn't uranium?\" she demanded furiously.\n\n\"I said nothing of the sort.\" Fred suddenly had the feeling of a clue,\nespecially because of Jo's reaction: again the blankness, again the\nnervousness.\n\n\"I saw it in your face.\" Jo edged to the end of one table. \"Here's\ntoday's find. Seedless grapes, each as big as a lemon. Have one.\" She\nheld out her hand.\n\n_There was nothing in it._\n\nFred didn't bat an eyelash; he'd grown used to shocks. He merely\nreplied, \"No, thanks. Still full from dinner.\" And then integrated more\ndata.\n\nThey finished the tour at her cabin. From the time that the trip\nstarted, and until the last few nights, Fred had insisted on \"walking\nthe girl home.\" And each time, before he left her, he'd quasi-seriously\npropositioned her with a request that the door be left open. It was\nalways shut, very firmly.\n\nTonight, Fred was grave. Almost curt, he said, \"Goodnight. See you in\nthe morning.\"\n\n\"Wait.\" She smiled. \"If you could learn to be as happy as we on this\nplanet, you might find the door open.\"\n\nHe smiled in return. \"I'll think about it. Night.\" Fred strode away,\nthinking: Jo, you'd make a lousy Mata Hari. But thanks for convincing\nme I'm sane!\n\nRelief brought emotional reaction; he wanted to laugh, but it was\naggressive, humorless laughter, and he couldn't afford it. Instead, he\npermitted himself the luxury of silent anger. Complete. Total.\n\n\n\nWhen the curtain of fury dissolved, Fred found himself in the\nrecreation area. Unknowingly, he'd wandered there. Unknowingly, he'd\narrived at a course of action--\n\n_You won't have a chance to carry it out._\n\nThat voice again! It was inside his head. This time, however, Fred\nstraightened, unconsciously, said, \"So I was wrong, and we did find\nintelligent life.\"\n\n_But not the sort you expected._\n\n\"Admitted. It's difficult to believe that a planet is alive.\"\n\n_Why so? Logically, you animals are the difficult beliefs. Nearly\nall else in the universe is direct--energy conversion, formation of\nelements, and the like. You animals require many things to get started:\na planet; a fluid medium such as water; and the delicate balance\nof conditions for food input and waste removal. In a sense, you're\nparasites._\n\n\"Certainly. But why are you trying so hard to convince my friends to be\nparasites?\" Fred stopped for a second, struck by a thought. \"Come to\nthink of it, why am I immune?\"\n\n_There is always a certain small percentage who have crossed mental\npatterns, whom we can communicate with. What the others see as\ndesirable, you dislike. If you'll think a moment, you'll realize you've\nalways been that way._\n\nFred nodded. He was the eternal pessimist surrounded by optimists.\n\n_My desire is simple. I want a population._\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n_We use animal intelligence. When you die, we absorb the life force\ndirectly. It sustains our own._\n\n\"In a sense,\" Fred felt he'd scored, \"you also are a parasite. You talk\nas though there are other sentient planets in the universe.\"\n\n_There are, though not in great numbers. Our life cycle is similar to\nyours. We are born in cosmic space of elemental material; we attract\nanimal populations that have evolved on the dead planets, and thereby\ngain the energy needed to live--just as you live from the lower\nanimals. We even grow old and die after two or three billion years. But\nI'm young, and this is the first time I've been in this portion of the\ngalaxy--I need a population._\n\n\"You seem to know what's in my mind,\" Fred said calmly, \"so I'm afraid\nyou're going to be disappointed.\"\n\n_No, I need the others here for a little more time; they must be\ncompletely convinced of my wonders so they can take the story home. I\ncan do without you, however. Why do you think I've bothered at all to\ncommunicate with you?_\n\nFred's spine was icy. His mouth was dry, and all of the dark shapes\nthat terrified him throughout his youth came home to jibber behind his\nback. But Fred was a man, and he refused to turn his head, to give in\nto the fear. \"I don't know why.\"\n\n_I couldn't let you take the ship from my surface. I have no physical\ncontrol over you, and I can't speak directly to the others, only\ninfluence their emotions. While I've delayed you, I've aroused one of\nthem.... Now you have your answer._\n\n\n\nThere was a step behind him. Expecting Lodgesen, Fred turned, stopped\nin shock. The 6-1/2-foot, 285-pound bulk of Charlesworth stood poised,\nthen raced forward. Fred hadn't time to get set, bounced when the\nautomaton hit him, fell heavily against the exhibit table. Instantly,\nCharlesworth had dropped on him. The big man's hands were around Fred's\nthroat.\n\nHis vision blurred; little spots of ink crept down over Charlesworth's\nface; it was too much of an effort to lift his arms and try to push him\naway.\n\nThere was a quick rush of thoughts. Wish you'd stop; it hurts. But\nwhat's this? Something cool and heavy in my hand. I suppose I should\ntry it....\n\nWhen Fred's head cleared, he saw Charlesworth stretched out beside him,\nhis chin split and bleeding. The hunk of quartzite lay between the\ncaptain and Fred.\n\nHe hadn't the time to be glad he was alive. The others were up; running\nfootsteps were converging on him. He got up, staggered from the room.\nThen, as strength returned, he raced for the control center.\n\nHe almost made it. But Beth suddenly appeared from the opposite end of\nthe corridor. Face contorted in some nameless horror, she screamed a\nwarning, ran towards the door to the center. And Beth was closer.\n\nAgonizingly closer. She'd be there a step ahead of him, and if she got\nthat door locked--With crystal clarity, he knew it meant the end of\nprogress for the human race.\n\nFred, who was hardly aware of baseball, desperately arched his body\ninto a perfect slide. It got faint cheers from Cobb, Mays, and all the\nkids who ever played sandlot ball. Beth's feet tangled with Fred's; she\nstumbled against the door, tripped, and rolled into the corridor.\n\nFred scrambled inside, locked the door. He was home safe.\n\nHe would now bring them all home safe.\n\nHe couldn't know that the worst was coming.\n\n\n\nCharlesworth gingerly felt his jaw as he walked into the recreation\narea. \"Did you have to clobber me so hard?\"\n\nFred grinned weakly. \"What are you complaining about? Did you have to\nchoke me so hard? After three days, I still can't swallow. And I've got\na busted toe where I hit that doorway.\"\n\n\"Speaking of which,\" Beth said, \"I've got bruises on my arms and legs.\"\n\n\"I couldn't be feeling better.\" Jo delivered the line perfectly, broke\nthem up.\n\n\"We still have to thank you,\" Beth said, suddenly serious. \"What a\nnightmare!\"\n\n\"Not thanks, Beth. I couldn't help myself any more than you. I can\nimagine what you went through; I suspect it was even worse for Jo.\"\n\nThe pretty blonde was startled. \"I haven't said anything--\"\n\n\"The intensity with which you were attracted,\" Fred broke in. \"I didn't\nknow it at the time, but it was the first clue. Women were bound to be\nmore affected.\"\n\nCharlesworth fingered his jaw again. \"Yeah? _I_ thought it was pretty\nbad.\"\n\n\"You got the full treatment, John, but only for a few minutes.\nNevertheless, woman's nature is far more intimately bound up in the\nlife force than man's. What you felt for a short time might have been\nequivalent to what the girls felt all the time.\"\n\nThe big man shook his head. \"Couldn't take it. I'd break....\" His voice\ntrailed away, and he looked guilty at reminding them.\n\n\"We have to face it,\" Beth said.\n\n\"How is he?\" Jo asked.\n\n\"Lodgesen hasn't changed,\" the captain said gruffly. \"He hasn't\nchanged all the time we were in hyper. Just lies in his bunk, crying to\ngo home to mama. It's spooky.\"\n\n\"We'll be home in half a day,\" Joe said hopefully. \"Maybe the\npsychiatrists can help.\" Beth and John nodded agreement.\n\n\"Possibly, but I don't think so,\" Fred said. Then a stray wisp of\nthought brushed his memory--\"The eternal pessimist\"--made him shudder\nand hurry on. \"From what I remember of psych, he's withdrawn past\nthe point of return. Like so many guys in the physical sciences, he\nhad a streak of insecurity. That's why the categorizing outlook; all\ndata must be fitted into a neat plan. He ran into a bit of data that\nwouldn't fit; worse, the data turned on him, gave him a sense of\nsecurity he'd never known. When I jerked us away from the planet, the\nshock to him must have been similar to the birth trauma. He slipped\naway from reality. Chances are he'll never come back.\"\n\n\"And the trouble with you guys in the social sciences is too much\ntheorizing on insufficient data!\" It was Lodgesen, pale, needing a\nshave, but otherwise normal.\n\nCharlesworth stood firmly on two feet. \"You all right?\"\n\nLodgesen nodded, folded his thin frame into a chair. \"I came out of\nit. Don't know why. All of a sudden, I was back. Like waking up.\"\n\n\"Everything seems to happen suddenly on the USS Taurus,\" Beth said\nlightly, \"We're glad, Dick.\"\n\nThings _did_ happen suddenly, Fred thought, too suddenly. I'd better\nmull this one over.... He got painfully to his feet. \"I've still got\nsome work to do before we land. Excuse me.\" Then, to Lodgesen: \"Take it\neasy. You've had a shock.\"\n\n\"So have you,\" the other replied with a wolflike grin, \"and you may\nhave others in store.\"\n\nFred ignored the remark, limped away. But instinctive bells pealed\na warning, one he tried to rationalize away. He wasn't having much\nsuccess.\n\n\n\nIn his own cabin, Fred paced rapidly, ignoring the pain in his toe.\nOn the view-forward screen, Earth appeared as a sphere. They were\nso close.... The view-aft screen showed nothing but the emptiness\nof space. Lodgesen's miraculous recovery had shaken him. It didn't\nadd, and the last time something didn't add, there'd been trouble.\nIncredible as it seemed, he wasn't really sure they'd lost the planet--\n\n_You didn't. You led me to the population I wanted. I'm getting\ncloser._\n\nFred trembled, tried to collect himself to fight.\n\n_You can't fight. You've lost already. Observe: even weak contact with\nthe mind of that other animal made it function normally. Soon I'll be\nclose enough to exert full control over the others again._\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" Fred asked.\n\n_Before I'm through, I shall convince all of the intelligences on your\ndead planet to join me. They'll know it's a much better, richer world._\n\n\"But it isn't!\" he almost shrieked. \"You can't support that many\npeople.\"\n\n_True. Many will die. And I'll be able to replenish the energy I've\nused following you._\n\n\"The race will revert to savagery, possibly even lower, to the caves.\"\n\n_That is not important, except that the life span will drop. This will\ncreate more life force for me. You argue in my favor._\n\n\n\nFred was aware of an urgent knocking at the door. He opened it, found\nJo leaning weakly against the frame.\n\n\"Fred,\" the girl spoke slowly, \"help me ... the nightmare's back ...\nhelp all of us.\" She was crying, and her eyes were caves of dark\nterror. He held her tightly, and she sagged against him. \"I can't hold\nout ... the others have gone under ... a miracle, Fred--\"\n\n_I'll take this one now; I am strong enough._\n\n\"... need a mir--\" Jo stiffened, spoke firmly. \"I'm going back to my\nfriends. If you're silly enough not to want New Earth, I can't help\nyou.\" She left, striding purposefully.\n\n\"Damn you. Damn you!\" Fred's voice was hard, cold. Man, the artist,\nand man, the hunter, stood helpless before this power. But man, the\ntoolmaker--he bent his environment. That was it! The different faces of\nman, the ambivalent. That was it! The pieces were in place.\n\n\"Earth!\" he called piercingly. \"Earth, you are one like this other\nplanet. Help us!\"\n\n_Stop!_ The hated sound beat at him.\n\nAnd then he heard a new voice, an aged crone: _Can't. Too old._\n\n\"This new one will take us from you,\" Fred went on, \"just as you took\nus from Alpha Centauri IV. Help us now.\"\n\n_Can't. It would mean my death. All my reserves of life force._\n\nFred heard noise in the corridor outside. There could be only one\nreason why they'd come--New Earth would prevent his action by killing\nhim.\n\nDesperate now, Fred tried once more. \"Earth, die if you must! Die for\nthe 46 other populations that died for you. Your life is almost over;\nours has just begun. You owe us something. We battled our way up from\nnothingness; you held us back. Because of you, we hated one another.\nFought. Killed. We could have been creating--\"\n\n\n\nThe door burst open. Four things, lacking any semblance of reason,\nadvanced on him.\n\n_Now you'll stop!_ The new planet's voice was vibrant, confident.\n\n\"Earth! Give us back our lives--\"\n\nFred went down under the rush of Charlesworth and Lodgesen.\nFingernails--what used to be feminine--tore at his face. A foot crashed\ninto his ribs. Then, as fast as it had begun, the torment stopped.\n\nHe raised his head, saw the two screens. In view aft, the intruder\nplanet was barely visible; Earth definitely seen in view forward.\nNeither changed appearance, but Fred's four companions, held in stasis,\nwere an indication. A cosmic battle raged, an impossible mental\nbattle: age versus youth, weakness versus strength, experience versus\ninexperience.\n\nSuddenly, the four came at him again. He hadn't the power to resist.\nWhat was the use? We've lost again; shall we lose always?\n\n_No ... you've won ... use the gift wisely._ As the voice faded out,\nthe view-aft screen flared brilliantly with sudden energy released from\na destroyed planet.\n\nThere was nothing but the sound of heavy breathing.\n\nFred tried to raise himself to a sitting position, sank back. Then Jo\nwas cradling him. Her tears, he thought, mixed well with her laughter.\n\n\"You did help. However you managed it, you saved the five of us. Are\nyou all right?\"\n\nFred smiled at her. \"I'm all right; we all are.\"\n\nThey were picking themselves up--except for one. A thin bundle, curled\nin a corner, it cried forlornly for its mother.\n\nJo pointed. \"Dick isn't all right.\"\n\n\"He will be.\" Fred felt mental chains slipping from him. \"We'll find a\nway, now. Don't you see, Jo? That cry is one of a new-born. Our mission\nwas accomplished. The trajectory to Taurus did find life--ours, and\nit's all ahead of us....\"\n\n\n                                THE END",
