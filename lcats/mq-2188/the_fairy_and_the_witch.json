No scenery is necessary but an\n  added effectiveness can be secured if play is given out of doors._)\n\n  (_Enter White Fairy from back of stage, to accompaniment of light,\n  lilting music if desired. White Fairy in pantomime casts spell over\n  region by tripping lightly to right of stage and waving wand, thence\n  over kettle, thence to front, thence to left. Exit White Fairy at\n  rear, music ceases._)\n\n  (_Enter Black Witch from left, plods toward kettle chuckling\n  fiendishly. Bends over kettle, presumably examining it, then moves\n  towards left across front of stage during reading of lines._)\n\n_Black Witch_ (_boastfully_) Mistress of this black night am I. Witch\nand wizard of all the powers of night and darkness I am. Supreme\nabove all good in the Spirit World, tonight on mundane earth. I come\nto work my spell and my skill in arts malign display. Not all the\nholy saints, who tomorrow rule the day, can wrest from me my power of\nnight--Hallowe\u2019en! (_in derision_) A hallowed evening! Oh, ho, ho! Ah,\nha, ha!! From that proud eminence brought low by me and now decreed to\ndevilish deeds and dark! Thus shall it ever be. (_Calling toward left,\noff stage._) Come now my hosts of somber reputation. Make merry! With\nfell design make we night hideous. Come Owl and hoot for me! (_Listens,\nno response, calls louder._) Come Owl! Hoot Owl! (_Owl hoots off stage,\nleft. Aside, chuckling._) Didst hear the old fool hoot? (_Calling owl_)\nCome nearer Owl, perch thou upon my shoulder. (_Owl hoots again very\nfaintly. Pleading_) Come Owl, Owl come! (_No response. Grows slightly\nalarmed. Muses_) What portends this? Am I now to lose my power as Jove\nhath so long menaced? Owl has fled and will not come to me. (_Pauses,\nresumes hopefully_) Ah, well, in my train come others who will heed and\nanswer me. This night Black Witch must have her way!\n\n  (_During next lines while calling upon her hosts the Witch moves to\n  and fro calling toward different sections of the region as taste may\n  dictate except as indicated with the lines._)\n\n_Black Witch_ Black Cat, most common beast of evil augury, what sayest\nthou? Come forth Black Cat. Let thy penetrating howl echo through the\nwood. Roost thou upon my back. Come Black Cat, oh! Black Cat come!\n(_Pauses, looks expectantly toward tree, no response. Then muses a\ntrifle sadly._) Ah! \u2019tis indeed a night of evil omen when my own Black\nCat forsaketh me. (_Turning hopefully_) Raven! Thou bird of sable\nplumage, bleak and drear, hear thy mistress call. Sound thy raucous\nnote athwart the evening air. Come Raven! bear me company. (_Pauses,\nno response. Despairingly_) Raven too is gone and will not heed my\nvoice. (_Brightening_) Oh! well, not yet do we despair, with ill intent\nand fury unabated call we yet others! (_From front center of stage\ndirectly facing audience._) Come snake! sleek-bellied serpent, curse\nof women, cursed by men, come forth my own beloved. (_Drags point of\ncane, wiggling, along ground from stage front towards self._) Start\nfrom thy hole, oh! snake of mine. Let thy rattling hisses be heard\namong the leaves. Coil clammily around me! (_Pauses, no response,\nresumes furiously_) Seven curses be upon thee, pampered pet of Eve,\nand thou wilt not come! (_Turns away in despair and next calls with\nrather hopeless air._) Jackal, night prowler of the forest, hast thou\njoined this motley crew of renegades? (_Pleadingly_) Heed my voice, oh!\nJackal! Prithee leave thy secret lair; come forth! Strike thy eerie\ncall weird and dominant! Soft-footed creep through the forest aisles\nreposing at my feet. (_Pauses, no response, resumes furiously._) Keep\nto thy den accursed beast forever! Rot and die!\n\n_Black Witch_ (_Musing sadly_) Even yet, methinks, I must rely upon my\nfrisky imps of darkness to aid in this foul festival! (_Again brightens\nhopefully, exclaims_) But no! But no!\n\n  (_At this line Black Witch should be near front of stage at point\n  directly in front of place where Mirth will enter. During next lines\n  Black Witch raises arms aloft in supplication and backs toward place\n  of Mirth\u2019s entrance._)\n\n_Black Witch_ (_Moving backwards, hands aloft in earnest\nsupplication._) Come, Wind of night! oh, Night Wind come! Thy blasting\nfury loose upon this world! (_Pauses, drops arms, no response, again\nmuses sadly._) Ah! Wind of Night, on which I\u2019ve drifted through the sky\nthese thousand years, hast thou too deserted me? (_Again raises arms\naloft and cries in desperation_) Will none come forth to do my will?\n\n  (_Enter Mirth, silently, directly behind Black Witch. Remains behind\n  B. W. and out of her sight, dogging her footsteps, poking fun at her,\n  making grimaces, etc._)\n\n_Black Witch_ (_Moving towards kettle soliloquizing brokenly_) Ah,\nmighty Jove, hast thou delivered me unto mine enemies on this dark\nnight of all dark nights?--Some one has cast a spell upon the place and\nfor the moment I am powerless--Aye! for the moment! (_looks at her rod\nas if conscious of it for the first time_) But I have still my trusty\nrod of black, and it will yet dispel this impotence oppressive--Though\nmy voice fail this rod will fail me not!\n\n  (_Makes passes over kettle with rod and turning slightly catches\n  sight of Mirth._)\n\n_Black Witch_ (_Rather amused as if White Fairy were a foe of small\nconsequence._) Ah, ha! White Fairy is now revealed as Jove\u2019s agent\nto work my ruin and she hath sent Mirth, her messenger, to haunt my\nfootsteps and bedevil me! (_chuckles, then calls_) Come Erebus, Imp of\nBlackness, come! Make haste and drive this Mirth away.\n\n  (_Erebus groans, off stage, left_)\n\n  (_Enter Erebus from left, treading slowly and heavily_)\n\n_Black Witch_ What ails thee, Imp of Blackness?\n\n_Erebus_ (_Yawning_) I sleep and cannot wake. My feet drag like lead\nbehind me. (_groans_) My eyes will not open and my body wilts in sleep.\n\n_Black Witch_ (_Musing_) It is the dread fairy spell! (_severely to\nErebus_) Cease thy deep grumblings and drive Mirth away from here.\n\n  (_Erebus takes after Mirth. Mirth tripping lightly, Erebus dragging\n  himself along heavily._)\n\n  (_Exeunt Erebus and Mirth to back of stage._)\n\n_Black Witch_ (_Calling, toward left_) Come also Noctis, Black Fury of\nthe night, come too! Speed thee hence. Lend thy brother aid.\n\n  (_Enter Noctis, moaning and yawning, also treading heavily as if in a\n  stupor._)\n\n_Noctis_ (_Lifelessly_) Did call me, mother Witch?\n\n_Black Witch_ (_Sharply_) I did, and art thou also sodden with a heavy\nstupor?\n\n_Noctis_ (_Trembling_) I am, dread mother Witch. My eyes refuse to open\nand my feet will not obey my will.\n\n_Black Witch_ (_Impatiently_) Cease thy grumblings and be thankful that\nyou live.\n\n  (_Enter Erebus from back moving with crestfallen air towards witch._)\n\n_Black Witch_ Even now methinks almighty Jove hath delivered this\nregion to White Fairy and our course is run. (_turns to Erebus_) Did\nMirth escape thee? (_Erebus bows head_) Sodden Imp! (_to both_) But\ncome, let us brew our witch\u2019s brew. Gather around and with mighty magic\nincantation will we boil a brew to blight the world.\n\n  (_Enter Mirth and Jollity from back as Black Witch, Erebus and Noctis\n  move toward kettle. Mirth and Jollity dog footsteps of the three,\n  remaining out of sight poking fun at Witch, etc. Black Witch, Erebus\n  and Noctis begin to spread out around kettle while Black Witch makes\n  few passes with wand. She catches sight of Mirth and Jollity and\n  screeches._)\n\n_Black Witch_ (_Screeching_) Erebus and Noctis! fly after these unholy\nimps of light!\n\n  (_Erebus and Noctis pursue Mirth and Jollity, the fairy messengers\n  tripping lightly, Erebus and Noctis following heavily. Exeunt, the\n  four, to back of stage._)\n\n_Black Witch_ (_following a few steps_) Fly, fly! Let not your\nfootsteps laggard be. Capture them and, returning hence, let their\nbones and flesh serve but to fill the pot. (_Turns toward kettle,\nchuckling with glee._) Oh, ho, ho! Ah, ha, ha! Two fairy messengers\nto grace the witch\u2019s brew. Fine will be the scent as their bones are\nburned and flesh is boiled into the stew! (_Turning_) Erebus and\nNoctis, fail me not!\n\n  (_Enter Erebus and Noctis returning from chase empty handed, from\n  back of stage._)\n\n_Black Witch_ Didst let them escape thee, dull imps?\n\n_Erebus and Noctis_ (_heads hanging_) Aye, dread mother.\n\n_Black Witch_ (_Beating Erebus and Noctis about shoulders with rod_)\nStupid dullards! Worthless laggards! See that ye fail me not again!\n(_Indignant_) Come with me and gather \u2019round the cauldron.\n\n  (_They move over to kettle and take positions around it. Black Witch\n  makes passes with rod and at signal from Black Witch all three chant\n  chorus of incantation song. The solo stanzas of this song, also the\n  chorus are to be droned out in a slow, sing-song chant, no particular\n  tune or melody desired. Make it as weirdly unmusical and inharmonious\n  as possible, but let the words \u201cget across\u201d distinctly._)\n\n_Chorus_ (_Black Witch, Erebus and Noctis, while moving around the\nkettle circling slowly._)\n\n  We\u2019re watching the pot and it\u2019s going to boil;\n  The air will get hot and this region will spoil,\n  But that matters not for we brew witches\u2019 oil.\n\n  (_Stop circling. Black Witch waves rod. She reaches over and fingers\n  the head of Erebus, tosses hand toward cauldron. Repeats process with\n  Noctis. The three immediately resume circling around kettle while\n  Black Witch sings first stanza in solo._)\n\n_Black Witch_ (_solo chant_)\n\n  1 A louse and a lizard\n    And two babies fair;\n    The brains of a pole-cat,\n    Some coyote\u2019s hair;\n    Animals, reptiles\n    And birds of the air,\n    We take of their entrails\n    And stir them with care.\n\n_Chorus_ (_the three, still circling_)\n\n  We\u2019re watching the pot and it\u2019s going to boil,\n  The air will get hot and this region will spoil,\n  But that matters not for we brew witches\u2019 oil.\n\n  (_All cease circling at conclusion of this chorus. Black Witch to be\n  behind kettle facing audience. Erebus and Noctis on each side. While\n  Black Witch sings next stanza the three sway back and forth but do\n  not circle around._)\n\n_Black Witch_ (_solo chants_)\n\n  2 To those must be added\n    The element, strife;\n    Some envy and malice--\n    The ills of our life--\n    Vengeance and jealousy,\n    Backbiting, lies,\n    All put in the kettle\n    With things we despise!\n\n  (_The three immediately begin circling again and chant chorus._)\n\n_All_ We\u2019re watching the pot and it\u2019s going to boil,\n      The air will get hot and this region----\n\n_Black Witch_ (_Interrupting hysterically and shaking rod menacingly\ntowards Erebus and Noctis in turn._) Curses upon thee, torpid imps!\nCanst not chant with thy wonted vim? Let thy voices swell to the far\ngods, else will sovereign Jove hear us not. Raise thy voices. I command\nthee!\n\n  (_The three resume circling and re-commence the chorus, Erebus and\n  Noctis chanting louder._)\n\n  _All_ We\u2019re watching the pot and it\u2019s going to boil,\n        The air will get hot and this region will spoil,\n        But that matters not for we----\n\n_Black Witch_ (_Interrupting by beating the kettle with rod and\nscreaming furiously_) Curses upon thee, dead! black! pot!!\n\n  (_Enter White Fairy at back of stage at word \u201cpot\u201d. Fairy raises\n  wand. Light appears inside of kettle as Black Witch beats it, to be\n  so timed that the glow appears at instant White Fairy raises wand._)\n\n_Black Witch_ (_screaming triumphantly_) Ha! ha! it comes! Light\ncomes--light make fire--come fire--fire come!\n\n_White Fairy_ (_coming forward and interrupting_) Stop! I command thee,\nstop!\n\n  (_Erebus and Noctis shiver, moan and fall prone on the ground,\n  remaining there until told to fly by Black Witch._)\n\n_Fairy_ (_From position a trifle to the left and back of kettle, gazing\nsteadily at Witch, ignoring imps._) This night thou art delivered unto\nme.\n\n_Black Witch_ (_moving toward Fairy_) Not so, not so, loathed Fairy.\nThough ages old I still am young and thou shalt not prevail.\n\n_Fairy_ (_calmly_) Thy power is gone----\n\n_Black Witch_ (_Interrupting in derision_) Not yet, dear Fairy!\n(_continues with air of triumph_) See yonder glow in my black pot? With\nmy rod I brought it and it will burn and brighten until thee and thine\nconsumed and parched be, and the whole world blighted. This rod, my\npower, though it weakened be, is potent still and thou canst do naught\nagainst me----\n\n_Fairy_ (_Interrupting with cool hauteur_) That light is mine. I caused\nit there. Forever it will glow--a fairy gleam to light and bless the\nworld. Thy power is gone, thy rod is dead.\n\n  (_Black Witch begins to laugh scornfully, moves over and gazes into\n  pot, is startled and laugh is choked down._)\n\n_Black Witch_ (_murmuring hopelessly_) \u2019Tis true. \u2019Tis true.\n\n  (_Black Witch grows afraid, moves away from kettle towards left\n  across front of stage, muttering. Fairy maintains her original\n  position but turns around slowly following movements of Black Witch\n  with her eye. Fairy makes passes with wand toward Black Witch. Black\n  Witch trembles and becomes furiously enraged._)\n\n_Black Witch_ (_hysterically_) Begone, foul fairy, ere I smite thee\ndead!\n\n_Fairy_ (_Calmly_) Do thy worst. Thy worst is less than none.\n\n  (_Black Witch grows desperate, approaches White Fairy and raises rod\n  to strike her. At this moment B. W. should be to left of Fairy._)\n\n_Black Witch_ With mine omnipotent rod I kill thee!\n\n  (_Fairy smiles, holds forth her wand. Arms of Black Witch become\n  rigid in mid-air._)\n\n_Black Witch_ (_screaming_) Fly Erebus and Noctis, Imps of Blackness,\nfor your lives make haste! Away! Away!\n\n  (_Exeunt Erebus and Noctis to back passing to the right and behind\n  Witch and Fairy._)\n\n_White Fairy_ (_still smiling_) Break rod, rod break!\n\n  (_Touches rod with wand, rod breaks._)\n\n_White Fairy_ (_slightly toward audience_) And thus shall broken be her\npower forevermore.\n\n  (_White Fairy waves her wand toward Black Witch, Black Witch\n  trembles, groans, broken piece of rod falls from her hand._)\n\n_Black Witch_ (_muttering_) \u2019Tis true. \u2019Tis true. Jove hath forsaken\nme and aids this young sprite to do me harm---- (_words trail off into\nsilence as White Fairy continues to wave wand_.)\n\n_White Fairy_ (_Low and rather sadly_) Thy lips are silent now forever.\nNow thou must sleep--sleep witch, no longer witch.\n\n  (_White Fairy continues to wave wand slowly. Black Witch nods head\n  drowsily, wilts into sleep and falls to ground._)\n\n_White Fairy_ Thou hast fallen. A deeper sleep is thine than fell upon\nthe Imps of Blackness. Sleep forever--wake no more!\n\n  (_Black Witch exhales one last breath. Dies._)\n\n_White Fairy_ (_solemnly_) Thine is a sleep eternal. Thou art dead.\n\n  (_White Fairy gives one last pitiful look at dead Witch, then turns\n  away smiling._)\n\n_White Fairy_ (_calling_) Come Mirth and Jollity! Come, children, come.\n\n  (_Mirth and Jollity and children, come tripping in with exclamations\n  of childish delight, etc., until they spy the dead Witch; then their\n  cries are hushed, their tripping ceases and they move furtively on\n  tip-toe over to White Fairy glancing at her for explanations._)\n\n_White Fairy_ Black Witch is dead. Her power is gone, and Hallowe\u2019en\nshall always be a hallowed evening--holy night! redeemed from evil by\nthe power of light. Let men rejoice and women sing. Let children play\nand dance. This night, henceforth, is sacred to the joys of children.\n\n  (_Children clap hands in applause._)\n\n_White Fairy_ Come! let us dance.\n\n  (_Music starts up. Any lively dance song for children such as can be\n  found in any school music book will be suitable here. All clasp hands\n  and begin to circle around kettle, singing and dancing. Music breaks\n  off and all stop singing abruptly in middle of first stanza. Children\n  all glance towards dead Witch then towards Fairy._)\n\n_White Fairy_ What is it, children?\n\n_Mirth_ Good Fairy, we want no one to die.\n\n_White Fairy_ (_touching Mirth with wand_) Bless you, dear messenger of\nmine, but the witch is evil and cannot live.\n\n_Jollity_ Can\u2019t you give the witch her life but keep her evil power\naway from her?\n\n_Children_ (_in unison_) Please good Fairy, restore the Witch\u2019s life!\nPlease oh! please.\n\n_White Fairy_ (_pondering_) Your pleas move me. I will restore the\nwitch\u2019s life. In Spirit world she can no longer live. A mortal, she\nmust dwell upon the earth.\n\n  (_Children cluster in \u201cbackground\u201d as Fairy goes toward Witch._)\n\n_White Fairy_ (_touching Witch with wand_) Insensate clay awake! Moved\nby the tears of children, whom thou hast terrified and wronged, I give\nthee life. Thou canst no longer dwell with spirits. Wake in mortal form!\n\n  (_Witch begins to show signs of life as White Fairy continues to wave\n  wand._)\n\n_White Fairy_ (_Resuming_) Too long hast thou disgraced thy sex in\nSpirit World, in mortal life thou shalt assume the guise of man.\n\n  (_During preceding lines Witch must unfasten necessary strings,\n  hooks, etc., to allow entire costume to fall off as she rises. Fairy\n  reads next line upon receiving signal from Witch that all is ready._)\n\n_White Fairy_ (_stepping back and raising wand_) Rise mortal man.\n\n  (_Mortal rises, children cheer._)\n\n_White Fairy_ (_Continuing_) Be grateful for thy life.\n\n  Note--If part of Witch is played by female omit this line and change\n  words to feminine gender in following lines where necessary. In the\n  original production the Witch was effectively impersonated by a young\n  man thus bringing out a stronger anti-climax upon restoration to life.\n\n_Mortal_ (_bowing_) I am grateful.\n\n  (_Fairy disposes of wand by hanging it on her dress._)\n\n_White Fairy_ Thy life is due these children. See thou be good to them\nelse will thy life be forfeited to me again. Love them, I command thee.\n\n_Mortal_ (_bowing low and gently kissing Fairy\u2019s hand_) I will love\nthem and obey thee, most gracious majesty.\n\n  (_White Fairy and Mortal clasp hands and turn toward audience._)\n\n_White Fairy_ Thus ever shall the powers of night and darkness be\ndispelled.\n\n_Mortal_ And good will triumph over evil everywhere.\n\n  (_They bow to audience and to each other._)\n\n_White Fairy_ Will dance with us, my Lord?\n\n_Mortal_ Your majesty doth honor me.\n\n  (_All join hands circling around kettle and sing dance song. Organ\n  glides into march at end. All march off, Fairy and Mortal in lead,\n  then Mirth and Jollity, followed by children. Exunt all._)\n\n\nCURTAIN.\n\n\n\n\nTWO PLAYS FOR BOYS\n\n\nMr. Tibbals has been unusually successful in furnishing boys\u2019 plays\nthat introduce characters true to life. While the plays are strong and\nforceful in the lessons they teach, clean comedy predominates and the\nboys like them.\n\n\n\u201cThe Millionaire Janitor\u201d\n\nA comedy in two acts. Here is a rollicking play for eight or more boys\nwith plenty of action. Just the thing for a Boys\u2019 Class or Junior\nY.M.C.A. Easily staged and costumed. Opportunity for introduction of\nmusical numbers and recitations. By introducing such features the play\nmay be used for an entire evening\u2019s entertainment.\n\n  Price 25 Cents\n\n\n\u201cUp Caesar\u2019s Creek\u201d\n\nA splendid play for any number of boys. The characters are real boys\nand the play deals with their experiences while camping up Caesar\u2019s\nCreek the performance closing with a minstrel show in camp. Costumes\nand scenery are not elaborate and the play may be produced on any stage.\n\n  Price 25 Cents\n\nThese comedies are protected by copyright, but permission for amateur\nproduction is granted with the purchase of the book.\n\n\n  ELDRIDGE ENTERTAINMENT HOUSE\n  Franklin, Ohio\n\n\n\n\n\u201c_THE HOUSE THAT HELPS_\u201d\n\n\nWE ARE SPECIALISTS IN\n\nAmateur Entertainments\n\n  It is not a side line with us, but we devote our entire time to that\n    business\n\nRealizing that many people have grown weary of searching through\ncatalogs and reading entertainments only to discard them as unavailable\nwe appreciate the fact that our customers have often spoken of us as\n\u201cthe house that helps.\u201d We have had practical experience in selecting\nand producing amateur entertainments and we feel that we know what will\nplease the public, and what can be produced under certain conditions.\n=Our experience is at your disposal.= Write us, giving full particulars\nof your special need in the way of an entertainment, and we will select\na play, an operetta, a drill or even an entire program for you. =But\nalways enclose a stamp for the reply.=\n\n=Remember=, that in addition to our entertainments we carry a\nlarge line of publications of other dealers.
