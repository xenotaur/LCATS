    "body": "Thomas Lionel Ph.D., M.M. bounded out of bed with a cheerful bit of\noff-tune song. He glanced at the calendar and then the clock and he\ngrinned because life was just too good to be true.\n\nEverything was according to plan. He'd won his first battle. Up to\nnow it had been touch and go; at last he had established his right\nto co-occupy the mind along with the engineer. No longer could the\nengineer claim that he was an expensive detriment. He had forced\nthe engineer into agreeing that his offering, though not directly\nproductive, was a causative factor in the development of success. Then\nto top it all, he retained enough technology to be a necessary item. He\nmust be permitted to remain if only for a source of information.\n\nThe engineer's trap had been excellent. But the trap had turned and\ncaught the engineer. Those reams of data on the poltergeist effect had\nbeen the basis for an entirely new science that only a real physicist\ncould appreciate--and no engineer could hope to thread his way through\nthem without a research physicist's assistance.\n\nHe stood over the chessboard in the living room for a few minutes.\nThe engineer was not making any great moves. Therefore the physicist\nthought that he might best consolidate his position. He castled to the\nqueen's side, burying his king behind a bulwark of defenses that would\ndefy a master chess player to penetrate in less than ten or fifteen\nmoves.\n\nDuring breakfast, he perused a thin volume of recent publication. He\ndid not entirely agree with the theories presented; after all, the book\nhad been written for the express purpose of getting reader's viewpoints\nand Thomas knew it. In fact, the book was not too interesting to Thomas\nbut he knew that the engineer would fume, fret, and howl at the idea\nof having a well-thumbed volume of \"_Theory of Multi-Resonant Wave\nGuides_\" in the library.\n\nThomas wouldn't look at the engineer's volume, laying on the table\nopposite. It was too un-physical. It was un-erudite. It was \"_Basic\nTheory in Micro-Wave Transmission_\" and the edges of the pages were\nloaded with application formulas, diagrams, and working sketches.\n\nHe was near the end of breakfast when the glint of reflected sunshine\narrowed through the window and caught his eye. He looked, and wondered\nwho was landing on his lawn in a helicopter.\n\nThen he did a double take.\n\n\"Helicopter\" stemmed from Greek, the \"helix\" or screw plus the \"opter\"\na machine. This contrivance did not. It was not operated with air\nscrews.\n\nIt looked like a three-wheeled coup\u00c3\u00a9. It looked like the industrial\ndesigner's dream of the Plan For Tomorrow, excepting those three\nwheels. The Plan For Tomorrow should, by all rights, have four wheels.\nAnd, if the thing is going to fly, it should have some sort of overhead\nvanes, or wings, or engines, or jets, or even a skyhook. But there it\nwas, coming down as light as a feather to make a neat landing on the\nback lawn.\n\nBy the time the door was open, and the passenger stepped to the ground,\nThomas was standing before the little sky car, looking somewhat dazed\nat the name:\n\n                              POLTERGEIST\n\n\"Like a dream,\" said the driver of the sky car.\n\n\"It should,\" said Thomas, covering his ignorance with monosyllabic\nagreement.\n\n\"Handles well, too. I think we could stand a bit more positivity of\ncontrol, though.\"\n\n\"I'll look into it.\"\n\n\"I wish you would. We've got the jump on the whole world with this.\nWe'd like to keep it. But the thing doesn't answer to the wheel too\nsolidly.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh.\"\n\n\"The chief engineer said, 'Jim, take that crate over to Lionel and see\nif he will beef up the control force a bit.' So here I am.\"\n\n\"O.K., Jim,\" said Thomas, offering a prayer for the name that had been\ngiven unwittingly. The engineer must have been a busy boy! \"How are you\ngoing to get back?\"\n\nJim looked up into the sky. \"Jerry is following in the pilot model.\nHe'll pick me up and we'll go on back thataway.\"\n\nJim nodded skyward, and Thomas looked at the growing speck that must\nhave been the pilot model.\n\nThomas forgot about the pilot model. What he wanted to know was the\nwhereabouts of the five tons of equipment that had been an integral\npart of this idea. He looked at the model. He wondered whether the\nengineer had installed the whole thing, stepping up the power and using\nthe main part of the power to support the equipment. That did not seem\npossible. Any failure would cause the little sky car to collapse of its\nown dead weight. Besides there was not enough room in the little crate\nto pack all that equipment-tonnage.\n\nThe engineer had achieved the impossible. He had done away with the\nmain part while retaining the effect.\n\nThe pilot model landed. It was not the finished job of the prototype.\nThe cabin was squarely functional and the landing wheels were not\nfaired into the hull. The rear end, instead of tapering gently into a\nnarrow paraboloid of revolution, was a truncated four-sided pyramid.\n\nJerry did not emerge. He merely tossed the door open and shouted: \"Come\non--we ain't got all day!\"\n\nThomas nodded. \"I'll call you when I get it fixed.\"\n\n_Call who?_ the physicist wondered, and then forgot about it. He wanted\ndesperately to dig into the sky car. He wanted to find out where the\nengineer had packed five tons of equipment. He wanted to see what made\nthe wheels go around. No doubt the thing could be returned to its\nowners without calling in the police. The thing was probably recorded\nin the precisely kept engineering notebook of the physicist's alter ego.\n\n\n\nThe pilot model was not completely out of sight before Thomas had\nthe power cowls off, and the whole model stripped of its servicing\ndoors. They had done an excellent job of design; the sky car without\nits servicing panels was but a skeleton frame, with every line, every\nconnection, and every control rod open for easy servicing.\n\nAnd it was then and there that the physicist understood what the\nengineer had been doing.\n\nInstead of the low-voltage high-current supply lines, with their\nattendant heavy busbars, thin pipes ran about the sky car. Seamless\naluminum tubing carried the energizing current. Or, rather the space\ninside of the tubing carried it. At the generator end, a ten megawatt\nmicrowave generator supplied high power at ultra high frequency. At the\nterminus, rectifiers brought the ultra high frequency down to direct\ncurrent for operation of the force-field generators.\n\nThomas nodded. It was not the final tenth of one percent job. It\nwas not direct current. The diagravitic force was not constant. It\noperated only seven tenths of the time, and was turned off and on\nfifteen or twenty million million times per second. Nothing short of\nhigh-definition test equipment would ever tell the difference, however.\n\nGone were the massive electromagnetic deflection field coils. In their\nplace was a set of seventy kilovolt electrostatic plates.\n\nMissing entirely were the variable-speed motor generators. In their\nplace was a simple crystalline formation under permanent magnetic\nstress. \"Artificial radio-activated crystals,\" muttered Thomas. \"Good\nfor a couple of years.\"\n\nBut the feed lines. _The feed lines._ The current carrying ability\nof space itself--not the metallic conductor--did the trick. Using\nthe ultra high frequency bands, the busbars had been replaced with\ncylindrical wave guides. The depth of penetration was measured in\nmicrons at those frequencies--and as long as the guides were properly\ndesigned, they offered little loss in power. The current went down the\nwave guides by virtue of the magnetic fields created throughout the\nguides--magnetic fields generated in the space inside of the tubular\nguides.\n\nThe generator itself was one of the new crystal microwave generators\nand the rectifiers at the receiving end were of the same ilk.\n\nAnd the five tons of equipment had vanished in a puff of tubular\nguides, electrostatic plates, and intermittent operation.\n\nThomas hit a snag for a moment. The engineer had answered\nhis challenge. So he'd come up with the answer to the\nfive-ton-per-fifty-pound answer--and had gone further. Thomas knew\nthat there was no apparent limit to the maximum power or lift. It\nmerely set a fifty pound minimum--actually it was 49.87 pounds by\nmeasurement--under which limit no amount of tinkering would produce the\neffect.\n\nHe smiled. There must be something beyond. After all, small stones\nmoved quietly in natural poltergeist manifestation; they would be able\nto reproduce that eventually. But for now, the engineer was willing to\naccept the limitation whereas the physicist would not.\n\nHe knew now. And he'd leave the sky car until the engineer returned.\nLet _him_ beef up the control force. It was _his_ baby.\n\nThomas put the panels back on the sky car and stood off to admire it.\nIt was a neat job, just what the public wanted. The urge to get in and\ndrive was a most compelling one, and Thomas succumbed. He sat for a\nmoment, inspecting the dashboard until he had the pattern well set.\nThen he snapped on the power, took the wheel and pulled back gently.\nThe sky car lifted its nose slightly, and as Thomas pressed the foot\npedal, it took off on a side-line straight into the sky. He leveled\noff at a thousand feet and he did some scurrying back and forth in\nmidair. It did handle a little sloppy but not enough to make the\nphysicist uncomfortable. Yet it wouldn't stand any hedge-hopping or\nbridge-undercutting without a prayer on the part of the driver. Butter\nthe controls a bit and you could thread a needle with it on the first\ntry.\n\nYes, the engineer had done it again--all of which made Thomas chuckle.\nA bit more of this and the engineer would have such an income that he'd\nno longer worry himself into engineering. Then--\n\nThomas turned the sky car and drove across the city toward Dr.\nHamilton's place. He landed on the psychiatrist's lawn and startled the\ndoctor out of a week's growth.\n\n\"I've won,\" he told the doctor.\n\n\"Good,\" laughed Hamilton. \"Mind if I ask which you are today--and how\ndo you know you've won?\"\n\n\"I'm Thomas Lionel, Ph.D. And the engineer has worked himself out of a\njob.\"\n\n\"Interesting. But how?\"\n\n\"He dropped me a mess of cockeyed data, remember? Well, I unraveled\nit into a most interesting field of science. From it I handed him a\nslab full of theories and experiments that are just inefficient enough\nto make him fume. He's come up with several things that make money in\nvatfuls.\"\n\n\"That, I know and understand. Go on.\"\n\n\"Remember, I am his ideal personality, I am a physicist, a type of\nperson he has always wanted to be. He couldn't be a physicist because\nof financial reasons and so he went into the engineering field to\nbolster up his bank account. That was eminently practical. But now\nthat the worry about the bankroll is over, he can turn to theoretical\nphysics and physical research. That's me--and I've won!\"\n\n\"Suppose he, himself, takes the gradual retreat from engineering into\nphysical research?\"\n\n\"Um--I don't think he's capable of it. He's been too well conditioned.\"\n\n\"Might well be,\" admitted the doctor. \"Well, as I said before, I'm just\na referee. Both of you are well adjusted and good, worthy additions to\nsociety. Either one of you that wins will be a credit to civilization.\"\n\n\"You're a great help,\" laughed Thomas. \"But I don't mind. This is my\nround, and it's my game. He's licked himself.\"\n\n\"I'll tell him that when I see him,\" said Dr. Hamilton. \"But there is\none thing that I must know. I want to know what makes that little\ntungsten box work.\"\n\n\"I cast the tungsten in--\"\n\n\"I don't care how you made it,\" said Hamilton flatly, \"unless it has a\ndefinite bearing on how it works.\"\n\n\"I made it of tungsten because the engineer would rip it apart if it\nweren't too tough,\" grinned Thomas. \"Being of tungsten it doesn't\nmatter how it works excepting it would have been more efficient if I'd\nmade it of silver.\"\n\n\"Look, Thomas, stay on the subject. I want to know what's with the\nworks.\"\n\nLionel laughed. \"What's so important?\"\n\n\"Look, man, I'm a psychiatrist. The functioning of the human mind is\nmy baby. Or,\" he added bitterly, \"it should be. But, darn it, all we\ncan do is to surmise, theorize, hope and pray. We don't know what makes\nschizophrenics, or manic-depressives or any of the other mental quirks.\nWe aren't even certain why some people are well liked while others, of\nalmost identical get-together are heartily disliked. But you've come up\nwith a little dingus that causes a switch-over from one personality to\nanother merely by pushing a button. Find out why and we psychiatrists\nmay some day get to first base in psychoanalysis.\"\n\n\"Um--I suppose a real pathophone would be a help.\"\n\n\"Pathophone is a good word,\" smiled the psychiatrist, \"but to dig\ninto a warped mind without having the erroneous impressions and false\nevaluation clouding the only entry ... we'd be able to clear up almost\nany mental condition. Now, how does it work?\"\n\n\"I am not prepared to say. I was seeking experimental data on\nthe 'epicenter' of the poltergeist phenomena--the poltergeist\nusually manifests in the vicinity of or because of some central\ninfluence--usually a person who is unaware of his potentiality. At any\nrate, I was setting up a series of local magnetic and electrostatic\nfields and then trying the micro-microwave spectrum for response. I\nwas running up through the region between long heat radiation and\nmicro-micro radio waves when--blooey!--I was the engineer. I switched\nback eventually and consolidated my findings into that little tungsten\nbox.\"\n\n\"I want the dope on it.\"\n\n\"I'll give it to you,\" nodded Thomas. \"As soon as I make some final\nmeasurements and consolidate my data.\"\n\n\"Fine. Mind telling me what causes the poltergeist?\"\n\n\n\n\"As best I can. The present concept of space is that space itself is\nunder internal strain. Force vectors in cancellation prevail, resulting\nin a stable continuum. Space is warped by electrostatic effects,\nmagnetic effects, and gravitic effects. These local effects do not\ncreate a discontinuity in the space strain, and therefore no eruption\ntakes place. Now enters the epicenter. Radiation from his mind or brain\nin thinking goes out and starts a very minor sympathetic oscillation\nin the warps and strains of space. If these strains are in the right\nvectorial situation, the minor oscillation builds up the response\namplitude--\"\n\n\"That doesn't make sense,\" objected the doctor. \"Mental radiation must\nbe weak. How can it induce high power?\"\n\n\"It can't. But if you know radio at all, you'll recall that a high 'Q'\ncircuit will develop very high voltages across the terminals with a\nvery small driving voltage. Well, this is analogous to the epicenter\neffect. The epicenter wave causes instability in the space strains\nbecause the brain wave is not a natural phenomena of space. Then--like\ntwo sticks end to end under compression, it takes very little sidewise\nthrust to make the compression-force collapse, forcing the sticks out\nat right angles. Follow?\"\n\n\"But where did this energy or force come from?\" puzzled Hamilton.\n\"Isn't that a violation of the Law of Conservation of Energy?\"\n\n\"Not at all. The law is still valid. It does state that you cannot\nget more out of anything than is put into it. The guesswork comes\nin deciding how the energy got there. Coal, for instance, is just a\nblack stone. It has potential energy which was put into it by the eons\nof solar energy shining on the carboniferous forests. A stone has\npotential energy for falling. Where did it get it? It may have been\ncarried up the hill; it may have been dropped from space--put out there\nby the cosmic eruption that caused Creation. Or it may have been on the\nedge of a gully and the potential drop made by the stream eroding the\nground out from under it.\"\n\n\"How about atomic power?\"\n\n\"You mean, how did the power get locked in the atom?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"The power in the atom was put there by the universe's atom factories.\nSol, and the other suns,\" explained Hamilton.\n\n\"But where did the earth--?\"\n\n\"Creation,\" murmured Thomas. \"Who knows? I don't. Every time somebody\ncomes up with a perfect answer, someone else comes up with perfect data\nthat proves that the answer couldn't be _anything_ that anybody has\never used before.\n\n\"The atom factory is the Solar Phoenix. You start with hydrogen and\ncarbon. The solar heat is such that they combine atomically to an\nunstable isotope of nitrogen which immediately becomes a stable isotope\nof nitrogen. More hydrogen gets in, making it unstable oxygen and so\nforth. Oxygen breaks down, releasing energy, helium, and, what do you\nknow, carbon again, which begins to take on hydrogen again, and here\nwe go again. But the thing is uncontrolled hell on wheels. Things go\nwrong due to the variances of pressure and temperature, and the oxygen\ndoesn't always break down into helium and carbon. It takes offshoots\nand sidetracks. It'll add hydrogen and become fluorine, for instance,\nwhich then adds more and becomes something else, some of which trails\noff like the branches of a tree and do not break down into recurrent\nreactions. Hence the other atoms.\"\n\n\"I'll read about it and get the real picture. Know a good book?\"\n\nThomas scratched his chin. \"If you can find a copy of 'The Days of\nCreation,' by Willy Ley, the first part of the book has a description\nof the Solar Phoenix.\"\n\n\"Well, good enough,\" said Dr. Hamilton. \"But just bear one thing in\nmind. You think you've beaten the engineer. Your basic trouble is just\nthat the engineer is you, too. He has your ability and your knowledge\nand your experience upon which to work. He is no fool, and you can take\nthat as a back-handed compliment if you want to. He is just as capable\nan engineer as you are a physicist. He thinks in different channels, I\nwill admit. But, Thomas, remember that his extra-channellar thinking is\ndone with the same thinking equipment as yours is, and it is no less\nefficient because of being divergent from your own thought-track. Your\nbattle was won too easily to be conclusive.\"\n\n\"What do you expect?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know. I'm no scientist in physics.\" Hamilton held up a hand\nas Thomas started to protest. \"I use 'scientist' despite your dislike\nof the word only because there is no term that describes both of the\nattributes of practical engineer and research physicist. Frankly, I'm\nhoping for an eventual coalition, but I fear not.\"\n\n\"Why view no-coalition with distaste?\" demanded Thomas.\n\n\"Because both personalities offer much to the world, to science in\ngeneral, and to the body that houses both of them.\"\n\n\"I heartily dislike all aspects of practical engineering,\" stated\nThomas flatly. \"To be everlastingly forced to retrace your own\nsteps, again and again and again, working out the most insignificant\ndetails--bah!\"\n\n\"The engineer has another viewpoint.\"\n\n\"I know. But the engineer in this case is here only because of his own\nnecessity--which he himself has removed. I am the real entity; I am the\ndesire of the engineer. I am what he wants to be. _I am what he will\nbecome!_\"\n\n\n\n\"Good morning, Frank.\"\n\n\"Morning, Miss Elaine. Mr. Lionel isn't here.\"\n\n\"He'll be back?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"Oh yes. He went over to see Dr. Hamilton.\"\n\n\"Oh. Frank, the usual question?\"\n\n\"This morning he is Thomas Lionel, Ph.D., M.M.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"He went to bed Tom Lionel, Consulting Engineer.\"\n\n\"I wonder if he remembers,\" smiled Elaine.\n\nThe _Poltergeist_ landed on the lawn. It was silent, but a flash of\nsunshine caught the sleek side and attracted Elaine's attention.\n\n\"Hi,\" she called as she emerged from the house.\n\n\"Howdy,\" he answered. \"What brings you out?\"\n\n\"Never ask a girl a question like that,\" she laughed. \"You'll never get\nthe right answer.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"If she says 'you' it's either a lie or she's the kind of girl your\nmother tried to protect you from. If she says anything else, it's\neither a lie or she's the kind of girl your mother tried to protect you\nfrom.\"\n\n\"A man can't win,\" snorted Thomas.\n\n\"Does a man really want to win?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" admitted Thomas. \"I won't ask questions, Elaine. I'll just be\nglad you came.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you're glad.\"\n\nElaine flirted with him shamelessly, and then turned toward the\nlaboratory building. He followed, and they kept up a running fire of\nlight talk all the way.\n\n\"The first thing I have to do is to see what the engineer was doing\nlast,\" remarked Thomas as he opened the laboratory door.\n\n\"You are a strange fellow,\" smiled Elaine. \"You respect each other's\npossessions and beliefs, though you argue madly through impersonal\nmediums. Still writing nasty letters?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. And playing chess.\"\n\n\"What's he been doing?\" asked Elaine innocently.\n\n\"Don't really know. Aside from some experiments on the poltergeist\neffect--reducing them to practice--I wouldn't know. I doubt that he's\nbeen doing much else. I do happen to know that he's deeply interested\nin the epicenter effect. He may find the key to it, too.\"\n\nThe laboratory was about as he remembered it. There were some changes.\nA few of the pieces of equipment were moved; some of them were\nconverted; and a couple of them had been built in to other, larger\npieces. All of the workmanship was clean and shining.\n\nThe cyclospectrograph had been worked on with a vengeance. It had lost\nits haywire appearance. The D plates were all neatly machined and\nthe high frequency plumbing was all rearranged into mathematical and\ntechnical symmetry. The hours-use counter showed constant operation\nfor several days solid, which interested the physicist.\n\n\"He's found a use for it,\" he grinned at Elaine.\n\n\"He finds a use for most everything,\" she said. \"He's a pretty sharp\nman.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" grinned Thomas, recalling what the psychiatrist had said\nregarding the mutual efficiency of the mind in Thomas Lionel's body.\n\n\"Wonder what this crystal is,\" muttered Thomas.\n\n\"Looks like a natural quartz.\"\n\n\"Might be--though I doubt it.\"\n\n\"Can you find out?\"\n\n\"Eventually. If it is interesting, I will. What bothers me mostly,\nthough,\" said Thomas thoughtfully, \"are two things. One of them is that\nopen drum of gooey tar. The other one is that vat of used motor oil.\"\n\n\"The oil I understand. But what is the tarlike goo?\"\n\n\"I forget its name. It is one of the natural asphalt family and it\nranks high--along with chewing gum--among those substances in which I\nwould least like to bathe.\"\n\n\"Um. I detect a tone of distaste,\" laughed Elaine. \"Here's another\nlittle tricky gadget. Looks sort of like your tungsten box.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" asked Thomas.\n\n\"Yes ... say, Tommy, what's an epicenter?\"\n\n\"Ah ... why?\" asked the physicist, his attention on the\ncyclospectrograph.\n\n\"This box has a little sign on it. It says: 'Be an epicenter' and some\nother stuff.\"\n\n\"The epicenter is the main feature around which the phenomena\nrevolves,\" explained Thomas idly.\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\n\nElaine fondled the little box. Her forefinger touched the button, felt\nits smoothness. In her mind was knowledge of the dire effects caused by\ntyros who push strange buttons. Certainly there was no curiosity deep\nenough to override her own good sense. But subconsciously the natural\nimpulse to touch wet paint, to kick the package on the sidewalk, came\nto the fore and Elaine stood there, looking the box over with her\nforefinger set against the button.\n\n\"'Be an epicenter',\" she repeated.\n\nIt registered. Like a swift montage, events past, present and future\nsped through Thomas Lionel's mind. He went from the basic idea to the\nforegone conclusion in three lightning-quick steps.\n\n\"_NO!_\" he yelled.\n\nBut it was too late.\n\nAnd through his mind there passed a vision that made him swallow.\nElaine--dressed in a simple frock of printed silk, garnished from\nthe top of her beautifully coiffed hair to the bottoms of her\nexquisitely shod feet in an awful mixture of used crankcase oil and a\ntar-asphaltum--\n\nIn vain he tried to cross the twenty feet that separated him from the\ngirl. In vain he tried to get there, to snatch that devilish box from\nher hand, to grab it and hurl it far enough away so that the effect\nwouldn't even cause a bad splash.\n\nThe idea of seeing her all gooed up. That made him shout hoarsely.\n\nIt shouldn't happen to a dog--\n\nAnd then it hit him. He was fully fifteen feet from the girl and\nher little instrument. A half-hour's observational time went into\nmilliseconds in Thomas Lionel's mind as he watched the open drum of\nasphaltum compound rise out of the open top in a parabolic arc. It\narched high, just missing the ceiling, and passing in an ogee curve to\nmiss a stanchion. Forward it came, to curve downward upon his own bare\nhead.\n\nSimultaneously, he was drenched from behind by the arching column of\noil from the vat behind him.\n\nIn twin, converging arches, Thomas was inundated and thoroughly soaked\nfrom head to toe with a whirling mixture of oil and tar.\n\nHe cleared his eyes with squeegeeing fingers. Elaine, holding in her\nlaughter with effort, showed him the box.\n\nAbove the button it said:\n\n                           BE AN EPICENTER!\n\n               Control that mysterious power. Exert the\n               forces of hidden nature in  your behalf!\n\n                              PRESS HERE!\n\n\"He's found it,\" croaked Thomas. \"He's found it!\"\n\n\"And you're a mess.\"\n\n\"That I am,\" said Thomas shaking off some of the gluck that was\ntrickling down his arm. \"That I am.\"\n\n\"Don't you mind?\"\n\n\"I have my own revenge. My own, particular means of revenge. I'm sorry,\nElaine. I must now leave you. The engineer has had his fun--now, my\nsweet, he may have the compensating task of cleaning up!\"\n\nThomas turned and found the little tungsten box with its label: BE AN\nENGINEER! and pressed the button.\n\n\n\nTom Lionel, Consulting Engineer, removed his finger from the button,\nand turned to see Elaine.\n\n\"Was it funny?\" he asked.\n\n\"Very much so,\" she laughed.\n\n\"Who pushed it?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Too bad. I'd rather he got it by his own machinations.\"\n\n\"He tried to stop me--\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. Maybe it's better the way it is,\" Tom laughed in spite of\nthe load of uncomfort he was carrying. He wiped some of the oil and\ntar mixture from his face and continued. \"The instantaneous feeling of\nhorror at the idea of seeing you glucked over with this mess must have\ngiven him some shock. No doubt he thought that whatever would happen\nwould happen to the holder of the epicenter locator.\"\n\n\"Now what are you going to do?\"\n\n\"Me?\"\n\n\"Yes. You're going to clean up, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Not me.\"\n\n\"How are you going to ... to--?\"\n\n\"Cause his return?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nTom considered. \"I guess I'm licked. He'll just use this box of his.\"\n\n\"Can't you undo it?\"\n\n\"Nope. It's just too tough. I'd go to work on the insides with acid\nif I could get inside of it. The outside is possible, but I haven't\nenough acid to react with the whole darned box. But I'm going to get\nsomething. Well, I'm going inside and take myself a shower. Wait--I'll\nbe back.\"\n\n\n\nAn hour later, Tom Lionel emerged from the bathroom. Frank, the\nhouseboy went in with a humorous shake of the head. He'd seen the\nembryonic mess and knew what there was to do.\n\n\"Now what?\" asked Elaine.\n\n\"Well, you see, the thing is slightly out of hand,\" exclaimed Tom. \"I\nstarted this thing because my physicist friend got out of line and\nshot the entire bankroll on a pile of scientific flapdoodle.\" He took a\ncigarette case from his pocket that glinted and iridesced as he opened\nit. \"I've been able to use nearly everything,\" he grinned, \"including\nthe ruling engine,\" he waved the grating-ruled cigarette case at the\ngirl. \"Marten shelled out about ten thousand bucks for the secret of\nthe finish on this case. He's ruling jewelry now and it is the largest\nthing since the discovery of diamond-faceting. I'm also getting a five\npercent royalty on every grating-ruled piece that's made. It ain't hay.\n\n\"Anyway, it backfired on me because I presented him with something\nthat offered him, not frustration, but instead, he proceeded to\nmake something of it that no sensible engineer could ignore. And,\"\nhe continued ruefully, \"it did two more drastic things. One, it\nmade his continued influence necessary. There are too many things\nthat he knows to dispense with his type of thinking. Number two, my\nsuccess in reducing his discoveries to practice has resulted in the\ngeneration of a good income. That has been the basis of our argument.\nHe's impractical to the extreme, but as long as the body is fed,\nboth materially and intellectually, so what? So instead of finding\nmyself the winner, I'm actually fighting for my own existence.\" Tom\nwent bitter. \"A fine thing. To be forced to fight for one's existence\nbecause of factors that emanate from his own success.\"\n\nElaine put a hand on his shoulder. \"Don't be bitter,\" she said\nsoftly. \"I ... I'll miss you--\"\n\n\"Oh, don't worry,\" he told her in a strained voice. \"I don't intend\nto give up.\" He cradled her face between his hands and looked her\nstraight in the eyes. \"If, as, and when, I--though the concept is\npurely hypothetical--might possibly lose--mind, I have no intention\nof losing since I intend to win unconditionally and maintaining the\npresent status is intolerable--the other guy will have been in such a\nmad battle that he'll be forced into accepting some practical tenets as\na factor. Then he'll be more like me.\"\n\n\"This may hurt,\" she said seriously, \"but you are not as different as\nyou might think.\"\n\n\"He hates the thought of practicality.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" said Elaine, \"if all were engineers who would take time to\nseek out the little-known facts?\"\n\n\"And,\" snorted Tom, \"if all were physicists, we would still be hanging\nfrom trees, tossing coconuts at one another whilst a few bright\ndawn-men were contemplating the possibilities of using fire--but, of\ncourse, doing nothing about it. After all, once the physicist has\nconsidered all the angles, he's through. He doesn't give a howling\nhoot whether what he's considered is practical--after all, it _is_\ninteresting and that's all he cares about.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Since the physicist's thinking is actually based upon past proof--made\nby practical engineers--the contemplation of fire would be as far as\nthey'd get. For there would be no engineer to ever use it to show its\npractical possibilities! That's based on my horribly hypothetical world\nwhere all were physicists and none were engineers.\"\n\n\"Who invented the bow and arrow?\" asked Elaine.\n\n\"Ab, Ug, or Unguh. He, she, or it was an experimenter. Y'see, Elaine,\nat one time there were neither engineers nor physicists. Alexander\nGraham Bell was not--in our present day sense--a physicist nor was\nMorse, or Edison or Lodge. Nor were they engineers. Somewhere since\nthen the line has been divided. In them days they were basement\ngeniuses. But now,\" he said bitterly, \"there is one set of people who\nthink up cockeyed things and another set that figures out what to do\nwith them.\"\n\n\"Y'know,\" smiled Elaine, \"I think that getting together would be the\nfinest thing that ever happened to you and the physicist.\"\n\nTom backed up three steps. \"Look,\" he snapped, \"I've heard a lot. I can\nstand for a lot. But that's something that I can't even consider.\"\n\n\"Both of you offer so much to--\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" he sneered, \"and we're both solid citizens! Hooey.\"\n\n\n\nTom stalked over to the chessboard and looked down. \"Overconfidence is\na dangerous thing,\" he said with a smile. He moved a bishop halfway\nacross the board. \"There,\" he said with a satisfied air, \"that should\nbe obscure enough to fool anybody, even Lasker.\"\n\n\"Who's Lasker?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"One of the chess masters.\"'\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"Now,\" he said, \"I'm going to ask you a favor.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe grinned. \"It might be quite personal.\"\n\n\"In which case I'd ask you a favor, too.\"\n\n\"What kind?\"\n\n\"That depends on the nature of the original request. What's yours?\"\n\n\"I'd like you to write a few letters for me.\"\n\n\"In which case there'll be no counterproposition.\"\n\nFor three solid hours, Elaine sat at the typewriter. At the end of that\ntime, Tom smiled, patted her on the top of the head and said: \"You've\nbeen a good girl, kiddo.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" she mumbled. \"But there are things about your physicist that\nI do admire. He never makes his women work.\"\n\n\"Impractical lad,\" laughed Tom.\n\n\"Impractical, but fun.\"\n\n\"Bah. You, too, huh?\"\n\n\"Well fun is--\"\n\n\"Impractical.\"\n\n\"When you find time to be impractical,\" said Elaine, rising, \"you may\ninvite me over long enough to find out just exactly how practical an\nimpractical batch of fun can be. Practically, I am an impractical asset\nwith indispensable attributes.\" She arched one eyebrow at him and\nleered in a ladylike fashion. \"You'll find out,\" she told him.\n\n\"Dinner?\" he suggested.\n\n\"That I cook? Ah-ahhh.\" She touched his cheek lightly and then said: \"I\ngotta go. I'm late as it is. Sorry, Tommy. But that's how it stands.\nTake it easy--and I'll be seein' you.\"\n\nTom Lionel, Consulting Engineer, saw her away, and then returned to his\ndesk full of work. He sorted papers, did some computations, manipulated\nsome theory, and then sat still, thinking out his plan.\n\nHis evening was full. He experimented in the laboratory until the wee\nsmall hours, and then spent another two hours contemplating, with\nrelish, the results. He finished by writing another letter, taking a\nlast look at the chessboard, and then retired with a final look at the\ncalendar.\n\n\n\nThomas Lionel, Ph.D., M.M., awoke with a feeling of self-satisfaction.\nThe world was his onion and he knew it. There was nothing to detract\nfrom his success. After all, every time he returned it was because the\nengineer had been frustrated. The same thing had happened again.\n\nHe breakfasted lazily, reading the mail and the notes made by the\nengineer. The notes satisfied him. He added some notations and made\nsome calculations himself that would further frustrate the engineer\nwhen again possession of the body changed minds. He noted with relish\nthat the bank account was growing by leaps and bounds--a backfired\nresult of the engineer's own machinations.\n\nHow long it would be before the engineer was completely vanished he\ndid not know, but it would not be too long.\n\nA few more developments of the poltergeist effect, another series of\nnew sciences--with their attendant publicity, sales, and, of course,\nroyalty and licensing fees--and the engineer would find nothing in\nhis life worth living for. He then would turn, bending his naturally\ncurious mind to the more obscure realm of physics.\n\nIn other words, the mind of Tom Lionel would become congruent with\nthe mind of Thomas Lionel. Tom Lionel would vanish. Thomas Lionel,\nthe ultimate desire of the engineer's mind would take control and the\nperiod of schizophrenia would end.\n\nIt was more than just logical. The consulting engineer wanted to be a\nphysicist. Now that all barriers were removed, he would.\n\nThe hearty dislike of physicists that characterized the mind of the\nengineer was sheer jealousy; psychological block; that factor of the\nmind which, when denied a desire, hates all others who successfully\nachieve it.\n\nAesop called it \"Sour Grapes.\"\n\nHe noted the calendar for the day. He nodded. He was to see a group of\nphysicists from one of the government bureaus. That would be O.K. Later\nin the afternoon there was a conference between a group of production\nsuperintendents who were about to start producing items using the\npoltergeist effect. He made a notation to investigate the epicenter\neffect and see what could be generated out of it.\n\nThe latter was interesting, and presented a problem.\n\nHe arose from the breakfast table and sought the chessboard. He\nlaughed quietly and advanced a knight to cover his opponent's bishop.\nThat was in accordance with a well-known theory of chess. If, after\nseveral moves, no apparent pattern is manifest, attack with a minor\npiece--or even capture or exchange minor pieces. The plan of attack may\nbe obscure to you, but the chances are that a bold counterattack or\nexchange of minor pieces will disrupt the attack.\n\nWell, all was well.\n\nHis plans? They were simple enough. He would carry on. He would do more\nresearch, and confound the engineer whenever next he returned. It was\nas simple as that.\n\n\n\n\"The poltergeist effect,\" said Thomas, facing the group of government\nphysicists, \"is still in the field of research and development--and\nwide open on all sides. Much is still unknown about it, in spite of the\nfact,\" he added distastefully, \"that certain aspects of it have already\nbeen put to work.\n\n\"You are all familiar with the initial theories, though I shall touch\nupon them briefly here again. The spatial strains, when under the\ninfluence of solar gravity, lunar gravity, and terrestrial gravity\nall in proper vectorial relationship, add to the spatial strains\ncaused by the magnetic fields of the three main bodies mentioned. The\nelectrostatic fields in the terrestrial atmosphere--the same which\ncause lightning in another manifestation--also add to the spatial\nstrain. These are all natural phenomena.\n\n\"The radiation of a thinking brain, gentlemen, is not a natural\nphenomena--not a natural characteristic warp in space,\" he corrected\nwith a slight smile. \"It causes a vibration in the region of the\nend-hysteresis loop of space itself when space is saturated to that\nthreshold by the natural warps and strains. It exerts a triggering\naction that releases a more powerful nonphysical radiation, which in\nturn releases the space strain that causes--things--to move. Also this\nfinal buckling of the space strain releases a component of the initial\nwave which again exerts the triggering action. The proposition is\nself-sustaining as long as the gravitic, magnetic, and electrostatic\neffects are such as to maintain the saturation of space at the\nhysteresis-loop level.\n\n\"However,\" continued Thomas, \"it has been discovered that these\npotentials are not only released, but are dirigible, under the complex\nforce-fields generated by the equipment so far developed. Some effects\nare akin to gravitic effects--the real nature of which none of us can\nstate, or even guess.\"\n\n\"Your statements border on the fantastic,\" smiled the head visitor,\nLowell Johnstown. \"Were it not for the fact that your statements have\nbeen accompanied by experimental proof, we would be forced to discount\nthem as the ravings of an insane mind. However, your paper before the\nAmerican Physical Society plus your experimental data--which we all\nhave duplicated--gives proof. The nullification of gravity--\"\n\n\"Not nullification,\" insisted Thomas. \"I do not claim nullification.\nThe effect is a development of diagravitic force.\"\n\n\"The difference--?\"\n\n\"Does exist. The generation of a counter-force may, in some cases be\nconsidered nullification. But nullification does not describe all\naspects of counter-force. I prefer to use the counter-force definition,\nsince vectorial components may be generated in the object under\nobservation. These forces have no relation to the force of gravity\nacting upon the object, other than can be similarly observed in the\nfree flight of a projectile, where both the forward motion and the\ngravitic attraction cause summation of forces into a parabolic path.\"\n\n\"I'll accept your remarks. But we are here to discuss the epicenter\neffect.\"\n\n\"The epicenter is a generator of the radiation which causes release\nof the potentials indigenous to all material bodies. This radiation\nis of a complex nature. It requires both physical, electrostatic,\nelectromagnetic generators to produce the radiation that triggers the\npoltergeist potential.\n\n\"Incidentally, gentlemen, this may be why some people always seem to be\ngetting into accidents. I believe that we have the true answer to the\n'Accident-Prone' within our grasp.\"\n\n\"How does this manifest in experimental work?\" asked Johnstown.\n\n\"By crystallographic generation of the force-fields coupled with\nthe radiation of the brain in question. The effect is probably more\npronounced with a man whose prevalence toward poltergeist effects and\naccident prone-ness is higher than normal. I am seeking such a man now.\nBy further filtering through crystals the random release of poltergeist\nenergy is directed and controlled so that a desired object may be moved\nalmost at will.\"\n\n\"This equipment--can we hope to get it in practical size?\"\n\nThomas considered and then said with a touch of disinterest: \"It is\npossible. No doubt the practical viewpoint will appeal to many.\"\n\n\"To sum up your statements,\" interjected Johnstown, \"we have an effect\nthat will cause the movement of any desired object by the use of\nnonmaterial supporting and actuating means.\"\n\n\"Right. And one other interesting effect. The generation of direct\ncurrent electricity is also possible in the same manner. I might even\nadd,\" he concluded with a smile, \"that manifestation of any physical\neffect is possible.\"\n\nJohnstown packed the pages of data in his briefcase. \"You have unlocked\na veritable universe of basic study,\" he said. \"You should feel\ngratified. We'll keep in touch with you, Lionel. And, we'll return\nonce we have had a chance to digest this information. Also, we'll\nfurnish you with whatever observations we make.\"\n\nThomas watched them leave. He smiled. Adding to the discomfiture of the\nengineer at really having nothing left to work for--the bank account\nbeing filled daily--he was tossing his discoveries to the world of\nphysicists, and other engineers and scientists would take over, more\nthan likely leaving the engineer foundering in a sea of uncertainty.\n\n\n\nThe group of production superintendents entered and seated themselves.\nTheir spokesman, Charles Norden said: \"We are here because of\ncertain difficulties we are having in making your effect operate\nsatisfactorily.\"\n\n\"I can, of course, assist you,\" smiled Thomas, affably.\n\n\"Good,\" answered Norden. \"Here is the first difficulty.\" He pulled from\nhis case a sheaf of blueprints, and he spread them out across the desk.\n\"Our design department claims that the arrangement of knobs on the\npanel is inconvenient. A suggested change is to put them like this.\"\n\nFranklen, who was one of Norden's associates objected: \"That means\nyou'll have to shunt the snivvy over here. That lengthens the leads and\ncause instability.\"\n\n\"But we can reinstate the stability by running the leads through a\ndingink.\"\n\n\"That won't help. Shielding the leads only adds distributed capacity.\"\n\n\"It works. Only one percent loss in efficiency and better stability,\nbelieve it or not.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Norden, \"I'll leave it up to Lionel, here. What do you\nthink?\"\n\n\"I'll have to consider it,\" answered Lionel.\n\n\"You understand that it is important,\" urged Norden.\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"Why?\" exploded Norden. \"Great Scott! Look Lionel, the arrangements of\nthese knobs are such that the operator must cross the calibration-scale\nwith his hand while adjusting the output. That means that he must\neither assume a cramped position or he must adjust, observe, adjust,\nobserve, and so on, taking the adjustment of output by increments\ninstead of a stepless arrival at the precise value.\"\n\n\"Um.\"\n\n\"Look, Lionel, we aren't toying with the job of lifting a standard\nweight. We are hoisting three hundred tons of semirigid structure that\nmustn't be joggled too much.\"\n\n\"I see. Well under the circumstances I'll take quick action and give\nyou the answer within twenty-four hours.\"\n\n\"We can't have it immediately?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not. I must make some tests before I can pass judgment on\nthe matter.\"\n\n\"We are more or less forced to accept your time-limit,\" said Norden\nglumly. \"Please understand that time is essential because every\nminute that our production line is down costs the company about twenty\ndollars.\"\n\n\"I'll get your answer in twenty-four hours,\" Thomas faced another man.\n\"And your trouble?\"\n\nHe was Mawson, of Technical Manufacturing, Inc.\n\n\"You specify this part,\" indicating another set of blueprints, \"as pure\ncopper. Anything else do?\"\n\n\"It carries high frequency. Copper is best--unless you could get\nsilver. If that is--\"\n\n\"Look we're making production and hope to hit fifteen thousand\ncompleted assemblies per day. That piece would weigh about two pounds.\nSilver is out.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with copper?\" asked Lionel.\n\n\"It cuts like cheddar cheese, gums up the tools, and is generally not\ngood for close tolerance work.\"\n\n\"The first one was all right.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" said Mawson, \"you carved the first one out by hand and I'll\nbet it took you four or five hours. We're going to 'run 'em on an\nautomatic screw machine at the rate of ten per minute.\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"I want to use free cutting brass.\"\n\n\"You'll lose conductivity--\"\n\n\"The rig will be only seven percent less efficient. Tests--\"\n\n\"Your tests may be right. But seven percent loss is pretty bad,\"\ngrumbled Thomas. \"I'd say no.\"\n\n\"Then I'm going to ask you to name a substitute. What alloy would\nsuffice? I want a free cutting alloy that'll come off of the tools\nclean.\"\n\n\n\nWill White spoke up at this point. \"We've got a bit of regeneration in\nour driver system,\" he said.\n\n\"That's easy. Have one of your engineers remove it.\"\n\n\"Can't. Anything they do to remove regeneration also destroys the\ndriver's efficiency.\"\n\n\"Efficiency,\" said Thomas, \"is the inverse function of the frequency\nof drive divided by the number of full-phase poles in the genedyne.\nExpressed by the quadratic equation in which A equals the number of\nfull-phase poles--\"\n\n\"But we can't get rid of the regeneration!\" exploded White.\n\n\"Look, that driver is as simple as ABC. It has and will be a standard\nassembly for seven generations past and forward. Now don't tell me--\"\n\n\"I'm telling you that we're burning up our test stands left and right.\nHow long can you take a forty percent regeneration in a hundred\nkilowatt genedyne?\"\n\n\"Well, not long,\" admitted Thomas. \"You understand the principles\ninvolved?\"\n\n\"Not entirely.\"\n\n\"I'll explain. The force-fields created by the full-phase poles under\nthe power output from the driver create a nonelectromagnetic field\nradiation. The intensity of this field is a function of the driver\noutput, derived tertially through the pole system. Now the development\nof the field radiation creates a space hysteresis that--\"\n\n\"Look,\" snapped White, \"I don't give a care about field theory. It\ndoesn't apply in my job. I merely want to know what to do about the\nregeneration.\"\n\n\"How can you work without understanding the theory?\" asked Thomas with\na sneer.\n\n\"How can a musician play a pipe organ without a course in first year\nphysics?\" shouted White. \"Just tell me what to do!\"\n\n\"Tell 'em to retune the driver to another band.\"\n\n\"They aren't certain that the pick-up loop is itself tuned or not.\"\n\n\"It is.\"\n\n\"Then that means tuning the entire feeder line.\"\n\n\"Naturally.\"\n\n\"But the feeder line is a silver plated die casting.\"\n\n\"Change the dies,\" said Thomas.\n\n\"May we charge you for them?\" asked White, sweetly. \"And also for\nscrapping the three hundred and seventy thousand parts we have cast\nalready?\"\n\n\"Why get so far ahead?\"\n\n\"Look, Thomas Lionel, we did it because it was cheaper not to tie up\nthe die-caster's shop in weekly driblets rather than get the whole\norder in a lump. Now--what do we do about regeneration?\"\n\n\"Anybody can clear up regeneration,\" snapped Lionel.\n\n\"Good--you show us how. That's what we're retaining you for. Your\ndevelopments and whatever technical assistance is required.\"\n\nThomas Lionel looked up, and scanned each face at the big table. \"From\nleft to right, can you state your problems?\" he asked.\n\n\"Plating specs on the genedyne.\"\n\n\"Problem in suspension during process.\"\n\n\"Can plus or minus fifteen percent electrical components be used in\nplace of ten percents?\"\n\n\"We still require the alignment procedure.\"\n\nThomas held up a hand. \"O.K., fellows. Submit your problems in writing\nand I'll furnish the answers in twenty-four hours.\"\n\nNorden bobbed his head in agreement. \"I fear that I shall call for\ncancellation of contract and the forfeit sum if your answers are not\nforthcoming.\"\n\nThomas nodded silently. The forfeit--if this whole gang bopped their\ncontracts back he'd lose his shirt.\n\nHe watched them file out. And his eyes dropped from their stare out of\nthe window to the pile of questions on the desk. A pile of production\nproblems!\n\nSheer, unadulterated hell.\n\nWell, he might as well call the engineer and let him handle this.\nIt was one of the things that the engineer got a kick out of. As a\nphysicist, this was not his job--and as an intelligent physicist, he\ndid know how to get things done. Everything for its own use; if he\ndidn't know, he knew where to find out.\n\n\n\nThomas went out to the laboratory and faced his tungsten box. A twinge\nof wonder flashed through his mind. It bothered him.\n\n_Was this an admission of partial defeat?_\n\nNot at all. This was good sense. Call in the engineer to clear up this\nmess, since his income and well-being depended upon it. Once these\ncontracts were clear and closed--well, time enough!\n\nHe pressed the button.\n\nAnd Thomas Lionel, Ph.D., M.M., pressed it again.\n\nAnd again--\n\nAnd again.\n\nAnd then took a suspicious glance at the oxy-hydrogen torch on the\ntable. A growing fear hit him. Tungsten wouldn't budge under an\nacetylene torch. Acids were not too effective, and plain, old-fashioned\ncutting tools were sheer foolishness. But heat the block white hot and\nhit it with an oxygen lance--\n\nThomas looked on the back side.\n\nUh-huh. The engineer had enjoyed himself. The back side of his\nlittle tungsten wave generator had been poked full of ragged holes;\ncut in ribbons with the oxygen lance, and generally made messy. The\nwave-guides and channels were all un-terminated and laid open. Pushing\nthe button wouldn't do a thing.\n\nIt definitely would not call the engineer.\n\nHe had twenty-four hours to solve the production people's problems.\n\nAnd Thomas Lionel understood. The engineer had his own little trap. No\ndoubt the engineer would go fishing if called, and only the physicist\nwas really interested in fighting this thing out to the bitter end.\nThe engineer, losing already, had only a bank account to throw away\nby not working. And the engineer could get another one soon enough if\npermitted to do so.\n\nTwenty-four hours.\n\nThomas headed in toward the house to get his notebook and his\nengineering notes. He'd have to take over the engineer's job, no\nmatter how distasteful.\n\nOut of one corner of his eye he saw the chessboard and he stopped\nshort. It had been the odd angle that gave the trap away but his moving\nof the knight had opened a line right down into his own defenses. On\nthe next move there would be a severe attack against his queen, and\nin saving that, he'd lose the bishop. If he sacrificed the queen, he\nwas as good as lost. In fact, it was checkmate no matter how long he\nfought; no matter what he did, it was only a question of three moves\nminimum or seven moves maximum.\n\nWell, might as well give up. This game was gone and there was no use in\nfighting a losing battle--whipping a dead cat--\n\nHe opened the drawer and removed the little sign normally used to\nterminate a game without going through the formality of a checkmate.\n\nBut the sign had been augmented. It read:\n\n_Resignation Not Accepted!_\n\n_T.L._ ]\n\n\n                               THE END.",
