Dzhoubinsky, Foreign Minister, Union of East European\nSoviet Republics, to Wu Fung Tung, Foreign Minister, United Peoples'\nRepublics of East Asia_:\n\n\n15 Jan. 1984\n\nHonored Sir:\n\nPursuant to our well known policy of exchanging military and\nscientific information with the Government, of friendly Powers, my\nGovernment takes great pleasure in announcing the completely\nsuccessful final tests of our new nuclear-rocket guided missile\n_Marxist Victory_. The test launching was made from a position south\nof Lake Balkash; the target was located in the East Siberian Sea.\n\nIn order to assist you in appreciating the range of the new guided\nmissile _Marxist Victory_, let me point out that the distance from\nlaunching-site to target is somewhat over 50 percent greater than the\ndistance from launching-site to your capital, Nanking.\n\nMy Government is still hopeful that your Government will revise its\npresent intransigeant position on the Khakum River dispute.\n\nI have the honor, etc., etc., etc.,\n\nV. N. Dzhoubinsky\n\n\n\n\n_Wu Fung Tung, to Vladmir N. Dzhoubinsky_:\n\n\n7 Feb., 1984\n\nEstimable Sir:\n\nMy Government was most delighted to learn of the splendid triumph of\nyour Government in developing the new guided missile _Marxist\nVictory_, and at the same time deeply relieved. We had, of course,\ndetected the release of nuclear energy incident to the test, and\ninasmuch as it had obviously originated in the disintegration of a\nquantity of Uranium 235, we had feared that an explosion had occurred\nat your Government's secret uranium plant at Khatanga. We have long\nknown of the lax security measures in effect at this plant, and have,\nas a consequence, been expecting some disaster there.\n\nI am therefore sure that your Government will be equally gratified to\nlearn of the perfection, by my Government, of our own new guided\nmissile _Celestial Destroyer_, which embodies, in greatly improved\nform, many of the features of your own Government's guided missile\n_Marxist Victory_. Naturally, your own scientific warfare specialists\nhave detected the release of energy incident to the explosion of our\nown improved thorium-hafnium interaction bomb; this bomb was exploded\nover the North Polar ice cap, about two hundred miles south of the\nPole, on about 35 degrees East Longitude, almost due north of your\ncapital city of Moscow. The launching was made from a site in Thibet.\n\nNaturally, my Government cannot deviate from our present just and\nreasonable attitude in the Khakum River question. Trusting that your\nGovernment will realize this, I have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient and respectful servant,\n\nWu Fung Tung\n\n\n\n\n_From N. Y. TIMES, Feb. 20, 1984:_\n\nAFGHAN RULER FETED AT NANKING\n\nAmeer Shere Ali Abdallah Confers\n\nWith\n\nUPREA Pres. Sung Li-Yin\n\n\n\n\n_UEESR Foreign Minister Dzhoubinsky to Maxim G. Krylenkoff, Ambassador\nat Nanking:_\n\n\n3 March, 1984\n\nComrade Ambassador:\n\nIt is desired that you make immediate secret and confidential repeat\nsecret and confidential inquiry as to the whereabouts of Dr. Dimitri\nO. Voronoff, the noted Soviet rocket expert, designer of the new\nguided missile _Marxist Victory_, who vanished a week ago from the\nJosef Vissarionovitch Djugashvli Reaction-Propulsion Laboratories at\nMolotovgorod. It is feared in Government circles that this noted\nscientist has been abducted by agents of the United Peoples' Republics\nof East Asia, possibly to extract from him, under torture, information\nof a secret technical nature.\n\nAs you know, this is but the latest of a series of such\ndisappearances, beginning about five years ago, when the Khakum River\nquestion first arose.\n\nYour utmost activity in this matter is required.\n\nDzhoubinsky\n\n\n\n\n_Ambassador Krylenkoff to Foreign Minister Dzhoubinsky:_\n\n\n9 March, 1984\n\nComrade Foreign Minister:\n\nSince receipt of yours of 3/3/'84, I have been utilizing all resources\nat my disposal in the matter of the noted scientist D. O. Voronoff,\nand availing myself of all sources of information, e.g., spies, secret\nagents, disaffected elements of the local population, and including\ntwo UPREA Cabinet Ministers on my payroll. I regret to report that\nresults of this investigation have been entirely negative. No one here\nappears to know anything of the whereabouts of Dr. Voronoff.\n\nAt the same time, there is considerable concern in UPREA Government\ncircles over the disappearances of certain prominent East Asian\nscientists, e.g.. Dr. Hong Foo, the nuclear physicist; Dr. Hin\nYang-Woo, the great theoretical mathematician; Dr. Mong Shing, the\nelectronics expert. I am informed that UPREA Government sources are\nattributing these disappearances to us.\n\nI can only say that I am sincerely sorry that this is not the case.\n\nKrylenkoff\n\n\n\n\n_Wu Fung Tung to Vladmir N. Dzhoubinsky:_\n\n\n21 April, 1984\n\nEstimable Sir:\n\nIn accordance with our established policy of free exchange with\nfriendly Powers of scientific information, permit me to inform your\nGovernment that a new mutated disease-virus has been developed in our\nbiological laboratories, causing a highly contagious disease similar\nin symptoms to bubonic plague, but responding to none of the\ntreatments for this latter disease. This new virus strain was\naccidentally produced in the course of some experiments with\nradioactivity.\n\nIn spite of the greatest care, it is feared that this virus has spread\nbeyond the laboratory in which it was developed. We warn you most\nurgently of the danger that it may have spread to the UEESR; enclosed\nare a list of symptoms, etc.\n\nMy Government instructs me to advise your Government that the attitude\nof your Government in the Khakum River question is utterly\nunacceptable, and will require considerable revision before my\nGovernment can even consider negotiation with your Government on the\nsubject. Your obedient and respectful servant,\n\nWu Fung Tung\n\n\n\n\n_From N. Y. Times, May 12, 1984:_\n\nAFGHAN RULER FETED AT\n\nMOSCOW\n\nAmeer sees Red Square Troop Review;\n\nConfers with Premier-President Mouzorgin\n\n\n\n\n_Sing Yat, UPREA Ambassador at Moscow, to Wu Fung Tung:_\n\n\n26 June, 1984\n\nVenerable and Honored Sir:\n\nI regret humbly that I can learn nothing whatever about the fate of\nthe learned scholars of science of whom you inquire, namely: Hong Foo,\nHin Yang-Woo, Mong Shing, Yee Ho Li, Wong Fat, and Bao Hu-Shin. This\ninability may be in part due to incompetence of my unworthy self, but\nnone of my many sources of information, including Soviet Minister of\nPolice Morgodoff, who is on my payroll, can furnish any useful data\nwhatever. I am informed, however, that the UEESR Government is deeply\nconcerned about similar disappearances of some of the foremost of\ntheir own scientists, including Voronoff, Jirnikov, Kagorinoff,\nBakhorin, Himmelfarber and Pavlovinsky, all of whose dossiers are on\nfile with our Bureau of Foreign Intelligence. I am further informed\nthat the Government of the UEESR ascribes these disappearances to our\nown activities.\n\nAh, Venerable and Honored Sir, if this were only true!\n\nKindly condescend to accept compliments of,\n\nSing Yat\n\n\n\n\n_Dzhoubinsky to Wu Fung Tung:_\n\n\n6 October, 1984\n\nHonored Sir:\n\nPursuant to our well known policy of exchanging scientific information\nwith the Governments of friendly Powers, my Government takes the\ngreatest pleasure in announcing a scientific discovery of inestimable\nvalue to the entire world. I refer to nothing less than a positive\ntechnique for liquidating rats as a species.\n\nThis technique involves treatment of male rats with certain types of\nhard radiations, which not only renders them reproductively sterile\nbut leaves the rodents so treated in full possession of all other\nsexual functions and impulses. Furthermore, this condition of\nsterility is venereally contagious, so that one male rat so treated\nwill sterilize all female rats with which it comes in contact, and\nthese, in turn, will sterilize all male rats coming in contact with\nthem. Our mathematicians estimate that under even moderately favorable\ncircumstances, the entire rat population of the world could be\nsterilized from one male rat in approximately two hundred years.\n\nRats so treated have already been liberated in the granaries at\nOdessa; in three months, rat-trappings there have fallen by 26.4\npercent, and grain-losses to rats by 32.09 percent.\n\nWe are shipping you six dozen sterilized male rats, which you can use\nfor sterilization stock, and, by so augmenting their numbers, may\nduplicate our own successes.\n\nCuriously enough, this effect of venereally contagious sterility was\ndiscovered quite accidentally, in connection with the use of hard\nradiations for human sterilization (criminals, mental defectives,\netc.). Knowing the disastrous possible effects of an epidemic of\ncontagious human sterility, all persons so sterilized were liquidated\nas soon as the contagious nature of their sterility had been\ndiscovered, with the exception of a dozen or so convicts, who had been\nreleased before this discovery was made. It is believed that at least\nsome of them have made their way over the border and into the\nterritory of the United Peoples' Republics of East Asia. I must\ncaution your Government to be on the lookout of them. Among a people\nstill practicing ancestor-worship, an epidemic of sterility would be a\ndisaster indeed.\n\nMy Government must insist that your Government take some definite step\ntoward the solution of the Khakum River question; the present position\nof the Government of the United Peoples' Republics of East Asia on\nthis subject is utterly unacceptable to the Government of the Union of\nEast European Soviet Republics, and must be revised very considerably.\n\nI have the honor, etc., etc.,\n\nVladmir N. Dzhoubinsky\n\n\n\n\n_Coded radiogram, Dzhoubinsky to Krylenkoff:_\n\n25 OCTOBER, 1984\n\nASCERTAIN IMMEDIATELY CAUSE OF RELEASE OF NUCLEAR ENERGY VICINITY OF\nNOVA ZEMBLA THIS AM\n\nDZHOUBINSKY\n\n\n_Coded radiogram, Wu Fung Tung to Sing Yat:_\n\n25 OCTOBER, 1984\n\nASCERTAIN IMMEDIATELY CAUSE OF RELEASE OF NUCLEAR ENERGY VICINITY OF\nNOVA ZEMBLA THIS AM\n\nWU\n\n\n\n\n_Letter from the Ameer of Afghanistan to UEESR Premier-President\nMouzorgin and UPREA President Sung Li-Yin:_\n\n\n26 October, 1984\n\nSHERE ALI ABDALLAH, Ameer of Afghanistan, Master of Kabul, Lord of\nHerat and Kandahar, Keeper of Khyber Pass, Defender of the True Faith,\nServant of the Most High and Sword-Hand of the Prophet; Ph.D.\n(Princeton); Sc.B. (Massachusetts Institute of Technology); M.A.\n(Oxford): to their Excellencies A.A. Mouzorgin, Premier-President of\nthe Union of East European Soviet Republics, and Sung Li-Yin,\nPresident of the United Peoples' Republics of East Asia,\n\nGreetings, in the name of Allah!\n\nFor the past five years, I have watched, with growing concern, the\nincreasing tensions between your Excellencies' respective Governments,\nallegedly arising out of the so-called Khakum River question. It is my\nconviction that this Khakum River dispute is the utterly fraudulent\ndevice by which both Governments hope to create a pretext for the\ninvasion of India, each ostensibly to rescue that unhappy country from\nthe rapacity of the other. Your Excellencies must surely realize that\nthis is a contingency which the Government of the Kingdom of\nAfghanistan cannot and will not permit; it would mean nothing short of\nthe national extinction of the Kingdom of Afghanistan, and the\nenslavement of the Afghan people.\n\nYour Excellencies will recall that I discussed this matter most\nurgently on the occasions of my visits to your respective capitals of\nMoscow and Nanking, and your respective attitudes, on those occasions,\nhas firmly convinced me that neither of your Excellencies is by nature\ncapable of adopting a rational or civilized attitude toward this\nquestion. It appears that neither of your Excellencies has any\nintention of abandoning your present war of mutual threats and\nblackmail until forced to do so by some overt act on the part of one\nor the other of your Excellencies' Governments, which would result in\nphysical war of pan-Asiatic scope and magnitude. I am further\nconvinced that this deplorable situation arises out of the\nmegalomaniac ambitions of the Federal Governments of the UEESR and the\nUPREA, respectively, and that the different peoples of what you\nunblushingly call your \"autonomous\" republics have no ambitions\nexcept, on a rapidly diminishing order of probability, to live out\ntheir natural span of years in peace. Therefore:\n\n     _In the name of ALLAH, the Merciful, the Compassionate: We,\n     Shere Ali Abdallah, Ameer of Afghanistan, etc., do decree\n     and command that the political entities known as the Union\n     of East European Soviet Republics and the United Peoples'\n     Republics of East Asia respectively are herewith abolished\n     and dissolved into their constituent autonomous republics,\n     each one of which shall hereafter enjoy complete sovereignty\n     within its own borders as is right and proper._\n\nNow, in case either of you gentlemen feel inclined to laugh this off,\nlet me remind you of the series of mysterious disappearances of some\nof the most noted scientists of both the UEESR and the UPREA, and let\nme advise your Excellencies that these scientists are now residents\nand subjects of the Kingdom of Afghanistan, and are here engaged in\nresearch and development work for my Government. These gentlemen were\nnot abducted, as you gentlemen seem to believe; they came here of\ntheir own free will, and ask nothing better than to remain here, where\nthey are treated with dignity and honor, given material\nrewards--riches, palaces, harems, retinues of servants, etc.--and are\nalso free from the intellectual and ideological restraints which make\nlife so intolerable in your respective countries to any man above the\norder of intelligence of a cretin. In return for these benefactions,\nthese eminent scientists have developed, for my Government, certain\nweapons. For example:\n\n1.) A nuclear-rocket guided missile, officially designated as the\n_Sword of Islam_, vastly superior to your Excellencies' respective\nguided missiles _Marxist Victory_ and _Celestial Destroyer_. It should\nbe; it was the product of the joint efforts of Dr. Voronoff and Dr.\nBao Hu-Shin, whom your Excellencies know.\n\n2.) A new type of radar-radio-electronic defense screen, which can not\nonly detect the approach of a guided missile, at any velocity\nwhatever, but will automatically capture and redirect same. In case\neither of your Excellencies doubt this statement, you are invited to\naim a rocket at some target in Afghanistan and see what happens.\n\n3.) Both the UPREA mutated virus and the UEESR contagious sterility,\nwith positive vaccines against the former and means of instrumental\ndetection of the latter.\n\n4.) A technique for initiating and controlling the Bethe\ncarbon-hydrogen cycle. We are now using this as a source of heat for\nindustrial and even domestic purposes, and we also have a\ncarbon-hydrogen cycle bomb. Such a bomb, delivered by one of our\n_Sword of Islam_ Mark IV's, was activated yesterday over the Northern\ntip of Nova Zembla, at an altitude of four miles. I am enclosing\nphotographic reproductions of views of this test, televised to Kabul\nby an accompanying _Sword of Islam_ Mark V observation rocket. I am\ninformed that expeditions have been sent by both the UEESR and the\nUPREA to investigate; they should find some very interesting\nconditions. For one thing, they won't need their climbing equipment to\nget over the Nova Zembla Glacier; the Nova Zembla Glacier isn't there,\nany more.\n\n5.) A lithium bomb. This has not been tested, yet. A lithium bomb is\nnothing for a country the size of Afghanistan to let off inside its\nown borders. We intend making a test with it within the next ten days,\nhowever If your Excellencies will designate a target, which must be at\nthe center of an uninhabited area at least five hundred miles square,\nthe test can be made in perfect safety. If not, I cannot answer the\nresults; that will be in the hands of Allah, Who has ordained all\nthings. No doubt Allah has ordained the destruction of either Moscow\nor Nanking; whichever city Allah has elected to erase, I will make it\nmy personal responsibility to see to it that the other isn't slighted,\neither.\n\nHowever, if your Excellencies decide to accede to my modest and\nreasonable demands, not later than one week from today, this\ntest-launching will be cancelled as unnecessary. Of course, that would\nleave unsettled a bet I have made with Dr. Hong Foo--a star sapphire\nagainst his favorite Persian concubine--that the explosion of a\nlithium bomb will not initiate a chain reaction in the Earth's crust\nand so disintegrate this planet. This, of course, is a minor\nconsideration, unworthy of Your notice.\n\nOf course, I am aware that both your Excellencies have, in the past,\nfomented mutual jealousies and suspicions among the several\n\"autonomous\" republics under your respective jurisdictions, as an\ninstrument of policy. If these peoples were, at this time, to receive\nfull independence, the present inevitability of a pan-Asiatic war on a\ngrand scale would be replaced only by the inevitability of a\npan-Asiatic war by detail. Obviously, some single supra-national\nsovereignty is needed to maintain peace, and such a sovereignty should\nbe established under some leadership not hitherto associated with\neither the former UEESR or the former UPREA. I humbly offer myself as\nPresident of such a supra-national organization, counting as a matter\nof course upon the whole-hearted support and co-operation of both your\nExcellencies. It might be well if both your Excellencies were to come\nhere to Kabul to confer with me on this subject at your very earliest\nconvenience.\n\nThe Peace of Allah be upon both your Excellencies!\n\nShere Ali Abdallah,\nPh.D., Sc.B., M.A.\n\n\n\n\n_From N.
