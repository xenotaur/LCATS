    "body": "There are all kinds of men labeled with all sorts and degrees of psycho\ntags. For what it's worth, I have always been primarily motivated by an\ninsatiable urge for action.\n\nI have always awakened with faculties sharp and eyes clear, ready for\nany emergency of which there are plenty in these chaotic years of\nsocial adjustment from the Twentieth to the Twenty-fifth Century. This\nawakening I knew would exceed in magnitude any I had known. I knew I\nwas in a place to which the little alien man had brought me.\n\nI was stretched out on a smooth cold table of metal. I was also\naware of a contraption of unknown purpose clamped about my skull,\nand my entire store of bodily faculties seemed vitally prepared for\nany eventuality, as though steeling itself for a subconsciously\npreconceived super-human effort.\n\nI still hesitated about opening my eyes. It wasn't from physical fear\nwhich I have learned to convert into mental and physical energy. There\nwas a fear of that alienness. Alien was the word for the little man\nwith the bulbous head and crinkled little face of a premature child.\n\nI knew that his outer dress and hairless, swollen and blue-veined\nskull, and the invisible electronic force that had brought us here,\nwere all of some other time, world, dimension, or something of all\nthree.\n\nIt wasn't exceptional on my part to be thinking of such fantastic\npossibilities in such a calm and detached a manner. Nothing seems\nfantastic anymore to a Twenty-fifth Centurian. Nothing. What we have\nnot actually seen practiced through the marvels of chemistry and\nelectronics, we have been trained to believe possible. We have two\ngreat goals facing us around the corner of probability--an Elixir of\nLife from some bio-chemical laboratory, and a ship constructed for an\nultimate landing on a distant star.\n\nBut first, we must readjust the various political factions which\nprevent integration of human potential.\n\nThe last effort is the gigantic one. All other sciences have advanced\nbeyond the science of society which is still infantile, but learning to\nwalk more or less alone. The goal of global social integration is in\nsight, but the battle will still be long and difficult. This all leads\nto the body of this story--to the World-City of Mohln, to which the\nScientist, Draken, brought me for the fulfillment of a grandiose and\nnecessary, but horribly destructive destiny.\n\nWhen the Fascisti wormed their way underground after their crushing\ndefeat by the forces of World Democracy, after the close of that\nepisode of evolutionary birth pangs called World War II, they created\na small, evil and powerful recalcitrant force of reaction, seeking to\nregain minority control over the Earth Mass. Their threat is their\nsecrecy. They never work openly; they are too small in number; but\ntheir acts of sabotage and political intrigue is disheartening at\ntimes, and a constant threat to our Administrative balance.\n\nAs elected Commander of the International Secret Police, my sole duty\nis to combat the specially trained cult of sabateurs of our democratic\nWorld-State, the Black Spartans.\n\nSomehow that night--I've never been able to find the leak--two of them\ngained the top of my apartment building and were hiding on the roof\nlanding as I stepped out to enter my jet-car.\n\n\n\nThere was no warning, no challenge. Their aim was simply to burn me\nout. Some well-trained intuitive sense threw me in a long dive forward\nand sidewise as the shaft of deadly heat crackled past and smoked\nbeside my outstretched hand.\n\nMy E-special blaster was out and ready even as I hit the fine plastic\nmesh of the roof. I twisted over and burned a swath in their direction.\nI came up to one knee, keeping their area lanced with rays, then to my\nfeet, going to one side and trying to distinguish their black plastic\nsuits from the shadows.\n\nA form stumbled out of the thick dark. It was half bent forward,\ngrasping its middle. I smelled scorched flesh and knew he must be\nmortally injured, but I couldn't afford to underestimate the fanatical\npower of a Spartan.\n\nHe was still coming at me, so I burned him again, watched him crumble\nand sag. That was an error. The other Spartan, who was still somewhere\nback in the shadows of the collonade, blasted my arm, burning it half\nthrough. I watched my fingers curl and my E-special fall out and away\nslowly as in a dream.\n\nThere wasn't pain, physical pain. There was sheer mental anguish as\nI visualized myself closing my career of duty for the World-State, a\nfailure. I knew what they wanted with my corpse. Dead, my cerebrum\nwould be removed, activated, and its mental storage released through\nelectronic recorders the Spartan scientists had developed. They\npreferred a brain taken from death as there was no slightest difficulty\nfrom conscious or even subconscious resistance.\n\nBut the Spartan couldn't burn me without a parting voice. His egomania\ndemanded that I see and hear the power that had defeated me. He came\nout of the shadows, a black muscled melodramatic outline.\n\n\"Goodby,\" he slurred in a thick accent. \"For a reputed great man, you\nemploy pathetic guards. Your force is growing weak and negligent,\nAllinger. Soon our long wait and our long fight will reach its\nvictorious end, even as you reach your shameful end now.\"\n\nThe Spartan tensed his blaster and I leaped straight into it,\ndesperately, because I had nothing to lose.\n\nI never got to him, and his blaster never got to me. I hit something\npainfully and bounced off. My arm was a lump of burning agony as I\nthudded to the roof, stunned by an impact with an invisible barrier.\n\nThe Spartan was discharging his blaster at me, but the power rebounding\nflung him to his knees. The blaster was knocked over the side of the\nroof-landing, and the Spartan staggered to his feet again, and weaved\nback.\n\nThen, abruptly, his eyes bulged with awe that changed to terror. He\nbacked away, staring, not at me, but at something beside me. Then the\nSpartan disappeared suddenly. I heard a faint _whirring_ that rose up\nand faded rapidly. For an instant I followed the sound of the jet-car\nas it receded toward the red moon outlining the archaic structure of\nthe Golden Gate Bridge, then I turned to see what had saved my life. It\nhad been prolonged at least.\n\nI hadn't been at all surprised to see the little man appear on the\nprivate jet-car landing of my San Francisco apartment. There had been\nno sound, only coruscating shifting hues of light that materialized\nhim, not like the magic of old, but with all the magnificent and\nunlimited magic of science.\n\nHe stood there juggling the huge silver globe like a bubble toy, but\none that certainly could never burst. His long, delicate arms and legs\nand torso couldn't have lifted twenty pounds without straining. The\nsilver sphere must be elevated by unknown forces of its own.\n\nThe little man's body, only a bit more than bone tightly stretched over\nwith transparent, form fitting material, swayed toward me. The pinched\nup, chalk face in the midst of that bulging head studied me with\nenigmatic lack of expression that was extremely disconcerting. I could\nread plenty of purpose behind the blankness. So much elaborate ritual\ndemanded proportionate purpose.\n\nThe ancient bulky structure of the Bridge twinkled its lights against\nthe night sky behind the little man. Or was it the twitching of my\neyes? I was preparing for a run over to the Federal Building for\na meeting of the Pacific Defense Zone of the International Peace\nMaintenance Fleet, but, important as that meeting was to be, I had\nforgotten it completely.\n\n\n\nHis voice was nasal, squeaky, and somehow contemptuous. It was halting,\ntoo, difficult to follow. I doubted if he had ever employed the\nInternational symbols before. In fact, I intuitively knew that he was\neither not of my time at all, or not of my world.\n\n\"I have studied the psychology of all potential men for the task that\nis to follow. I have chosen you, Ivan Allinger.\"\n\n\"Should I be flattered?\"\n\nI studied him, but could reach no conclusion.\n\nThe face puckered more. \"Flattered?\" The meaning of the word seemed\nto escape him for a moment. \"Perhaps. It is a great task. I have not\nchosen you because of your physical attributes alone, although they\nseem exceptional enough. Your ideological background will synchronize\nperfectly with the job that you must do in Mohln.\"\n\n\"Mohln?\"\n\n\"It is another world. A future and far distant one.\"\n\n\"You are from some future time? Really?\"\n\n\"Yes. Mohln is another planet of this system, to which your descendants\nwill migrate in a length of time you would label one million years.\nOur greatest scientist, the atavistic female, Jokan, demanded that\nI go back into the past of the race and seek out an object for her\nlaboratory experiments.\"\n\nI accepted him as he presented himself, which is always advisable under\nsuch circumstances. \"I'm afraid that doesn't sound inviting at all,\" I\nexplained. \"A guinea pig of some sort for future scientific probing.\nSorry.\" I started away, though I knew he could stop me when he pleased.\nIt was a test. But he stopped me with a word.\n\n\"Wait, Ivan.\"\n\nI turned. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"My reasons for choosing you are different from Jokan's reasons. Let me\nexplain.\" He tottered toward me weakly on his spindly legs. I towered\nover him as he squinted up into my face.\n\n\"There are many reasons why I cannot allow your refusal,\" he said. \"One\ngreat reason that ties you with destiny.\"\n\nI tried to escape then, feeling that he was right. I knew that a series\nof unimaginable events were twisting me into cosmic circumstances.\nCircumstances too gigantic to even excite amazement or disbelief,\nonly stunned passivity. I wasn't able to execute an about face or the\nlifting of one leg that might possibly have sent me beyond the range of\nthe little man's potentiality.\n\nI had forgotten the silver sphere which bobbed beside him as a\nmonstrous toy might. It began to glow and expand into a great bulb\nof incandescence, and it caught me immediately and paralyzed me, and\nsucked me into realms of cosmology beyond the wildest imaginings of all\nthe Einsteins. I actually felt the sensation of melting. Of melting and\nflowing as an integral part of space-time, for want of a better phrase.\nI was an atomic drop of liquid poured into a river without beginning,\nend or embankments. Perfection was an empty, archaic word to me. I had\nnever thought it could be intellectually employed, and I was especially\ncareful not to apply it to that shifting abstract--woman. I was looking\nat it now. A perfect woman. A creation molded from centuries of\nperfection; a creation of symmetric loveliness that was literally and\nfiguratively out of this world.\n\nMy last day on Earth was ended. I had opened my eyes. I saw first that\nsome miracle of science had reconstructed the burned away half of my\nright arm. Then I noticed the woman. I was sitting bolt upright in an\ninstant on the smooth metal table. The little man with his strange\n\"Buck Rogers\" dress was looking quietly at me. And she was looking at\nme, too, out of slitted lids that veiled all the women of the ages in\nsubtly yet violently burning eyes.\n\nShe lifted a jeweled hand. Her sensual lips trembled a little before\nthey parted, and strong white teeth gleamed provocatively between the\nred lines.\n\nI started, and gripped hard at the edges of the table. Was this the\nway a woman scientist studied coldly and objectively a prospective\nlaboratory subject? I looked questioningly at the little wizened man\nwho had kidnaped me from my own world. His blank face showed me\nnothing.\n\nThen, when she spoke....\n\nI don't want to take unnecessary time at this point or any other to\nexplain or describe this woman, Jokan. I doubt if you could visualize\nher anyway, even if I occupied this entire narrative describing her,\nbecause she was too strangely lovely. She was perfection, as I've said,\nand that's all. Her voice was music, and I involuntarily started toward\nher as she spoke.\n\n\n\n\"Withdraw the brain recorder, Draken,\" she said softly, not taking\nthose icy eyes from mine. The little man, Draken, complied. She pointed\nto a great three-dimensional chart extending across the laboratory.\nIt was made up of shifting convolutions and numerical graphs and\ncomplicated combinations of shadings corresponding to brain patterns.\n\n\"That is your brain, Ivan,\" she said. Her voice was cold, completely\nfrozen, and yet--\"We know all about you.\" I felt a little\ndisappointment along with the relief. She turned toward Draken.\n\n\"You made a great mistake, Draken. Bringing in an Intellectual was a\nfoolish thing to do.\"\n\nDraken objected. \"But you said you wanted a good physical specimen.\nThis man is. You defined your requested specimen in no greater detail.\"\n\n\"But you should know that an intellectual can cause difficulties. This\nman would be considered a god among the women. Perhaps even among\nthe men. Mohln is at a point where such an element as this could\nprecipitate disaster, create perhaps a germ of dissatisfaction with our\ngreat order. Or is that, by chance, what you intend?\"\n\nDraken backed away. \"No, it isn't.\"\n\n\"Don't let the presence of this man be known beyond these four walls,\nor out of your own laboratory. For your sake and mine, heed my\nsuggestion, Draken.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" quivered Draken. \"I am heeding it. But you know my attitude\ntoward this _great_ order. You know how I regard the maintenance of the\nStatus Quo.\"\n\nI knew it too, from the way his pallid lips curled. This little man\nhated the Mohln system, whatever it was.\n\nJokan got languidly to her feet, a fluid musical allegro. \"I know,\nDraken. If you weren't the greatest thinker in Mohln besides myself, I\nwould report you to the Council for the Maintenance of the Status Quo.\nBut as long as you only think idly, you can cause Mohln no harm.\"\n\n\"The only harm Mohln can suffer,\" said Draken wearily, \"is to continue\non as it does now. Toward final decay and rot.\"\n\nJokan laughed frostily. I shivered. \"Stop worrying, Draken, and go\naway. I must begin my experiments.\" She turned her eyes on me. She\ncould have stared down a bronze statue. I turned my eyes from hers on\nthe pretense of looking for Draken, but he was gone.\n\nI jumped to my feet, and the movement revealed that I, too, had on the\ncostume that Draken wore.\n\nWithout egoism, I can say that it must have looked more becoming on me\nthan on the little scientist. I was at least a foot taller than Jokan.\n\nShe came toward me, fluid motion. I couldn't back away--I insist I\nwanted to get away for various reasons, the least being that I wanted\nto get solid on my mental feet--from the metal table. I looked almost\nfrantically for a door or some kind of exit, even a window. There was\nnothing.\n\nThen those perfect arms slipped around my neck and that body pressed\nitself against mine and--\n\nI am only human. That's a trite enough excuse, if an excuse is\nnecessary, but under those conditions I could certainly do no less. I\nlet my arms come around her perfect waist, and I bent her back in the\nmost acceptable televex manner and planted a long solid one right on\nthose perfect lips--lips I'm very certain had never been kissed before.\n\nAnd that was precisely the trouble, perhaps, with that thoughtless,\nbut irresistible, impulse of mine. Her nails were long and sharp and\nthey clawed at my face. Cold light blazed in her eyes, flashing with\noutraged dignity and burning hate.\n\nI swung down and away, sliding across the metal table, and stood with\nblood running down my face, with the table my only protection between\nmyself and this paradoxical Circe.\n\n\"Savage,\" she shrieked, and shrieking was very unbecoming to the cold\nausterity of her. In fact it was like a cloak I had torn away from her\nbody. \"Primal, barbaric beast!\"\n\n\"I'm not quite primal enough to cope with you,\" I said, looking more\nfrantically still for an exit. There still weren't any exits, but\npeople came into this room, and people went out of it. How?\n\nI expected her to vault the table after me, but she lithely backed\naway, and though I didn't realize it then, her cold brain was summoning\nher eunuchs from afar.\n\nA section of the wall to one side began to glow like a light through\nsemi-opaque glass. The light deepened and began to whirl. And then I\nsaw that there was a kind of opening there. Yes. A kind of opening with\nsomething promising no good lumbering through, its head and massive\nshoulders projecting up out of the shifting mist like a televexed\nfictional monster.\n\nIt was a monstrous metal man. A real, animated robot out of an old\nscientification fabrication. It was coming directly for me. I flashed\none look--I think it was a beseeching one--at Jokan. In such instances\nas that people swallow great lumps of their pride.\n\n\n\nJokan was stretched up to her complete height against the far wall. Her\nface was expressionless, and her eyes oozed liquid oxygen. Her hands\nwere strained into fists at her sides. \"Atavistic,\" Draken had said of\nthis female scientist of Mohln. An understatement promising no hope for\nconsideration.\n\nI dodged beneath the robot's reaching appendages. There were three arms\nwith a number of variously utilized digits at the end of each. And all\nof them were wicked. Many of them designed for purposes I couldn't\ngrasp. Anyway I looked at it, the robot represented a perfect mauling\nand crushing instrument.\n\nI can describe it now with a light touch. _Then_ I was trembling with\ncold fear, and sweat poured off my face as I eluded the robot by\ndodging about the only fixture in the middle of the room, the table. I\nnoticed a minor motion of Jokan; then I watched, with a hideously empty\nstomach, the table fold itself into the floor.\n\nI leaped to one side and grabbed Jokan, twisted her around in front of\nme, and said with as little chattering as possible into her perfect\npink little ear, \"Call them off or--\"\n\nI tightened my arm about her throat and began bending her head back.\nShe writhed around and kicked me, and her finger nails started their\nold habit pattern again. But she wasn't used to this sort of thing, and\ndidn't employ any real effeminate technique at all.\n\nI continued bending her head back. I could feel her choking and\ngasping. She knew then that I would kill her. I hadn't asked to come\nto Mohln, wherever and whenever it was. It was all something I had\nnothing to do with, that now threatened my life. All directly the\nresponsibility of Jokan. To me, she was a real Circe, deserving no\nsympathy, only hate, and deserving death. But I could never have\nactually tried, or threatened to kill her, under less pressing\nconditions than those. It was simply a case of breaking her neck to\nsave mine, which I consider justified.\n\nThe metallic digits squeezed shut on each elbow, from behind. I twisted\nmy head upward at the second robot, sweating pain in my eyes. Unfeeling\nparalysis then, as the digits tore through muscle tendon, nerve fibers\nand even cracked bone. I was mouthing sounds, probably screaming,\nhearing my own cries from a great distance, blinded by pain, a mist\nblurring my eyes.\n\nI was lifted straight up, then swung down beneath one implacable arm.\nI dangled there, my crushed elbows swinging and dripping beneath my\nface. I saw those perfect little feet come up and stand in front of\nmy tortured eyes. And they _were_ perfect little feet, encased in red\nsandals to match the blood from my wounds. Even facing torture, and\npossible death, I thought of them as perfect little feet. I didn't\nattempt to twist my face upward.\n\nI kept on staring crazily at those perfect little feet. There was\ncharacter and expression in them, different and more sympathetic than\nthe body they supported. They came closer, shifted a bit, uncertain\nand nervous. I had been brought here as the subject for anatomical\nresearch, a laboratory specimen to be dissected. Yet, for an instant,\nanother purpose had shown in Jokan's eyes. I knew that, or did I merely\nwant to know it. I tried to imagine how terribly lonely and maladjusted\nshe must be in a loveless world. Beautiful and to be desired, yet in a\nloveless, sexless world.\n\nWith specimens like Draken, I could easily guess that this was the\nkind of world in which Jokan lived out frustration. Perfect women, and\npathetic, skin-and-bone puppets for men.\n\nShe had said I would be a god among women. Without egoism, again, I\ncould see why. There was too much gross ambiguity. The women and men\njust didn't seem to be of identical species. And in addition, Jokan was\nan atavistic.\n\nWhich wouldn't matter anymore to me, because I was being dragged out of\nthere. Where? Into what? How could I know? I watched those feet fade\ninto blurred distance. They were whirling around as they faded. I knew\nI was losing all grasp of consciousness. Which was all right, too,\nbecause hard after the initial shock, the real excruciating agony was\nbeginning to shoot into my brain.\n\nOnly a few hours later, that's all, and I was all in one piece again.\nA more effective and healthy feeling organism than before, thanks to\nincredible biological treatments I couldn't even guess at. I kept\nflexing my arms, watching them bend and unbend with questioning\nfascination.\n\nI turned toward Draken. \"Why am I still here and alive?\"\n\nDraken's embryonic face puckered at me like an impish child's.\n\nHe explained: \"Jokan is an atavist as I said. Women have always been\nnoted for their bodies rather than their brains, although potentially\ntheir brain capacity has always been equal to the male's. And that\ncultural error has never been changed. Instead, women have grown more\nbeautiful and symmetrical with the centuries, from the standpoint of\ndecadent and ancient aesthetic values. The men, on the other hand,\nhave always been considered as thinkers rather than as creations of\nbeauty. They have developed brain potential alone, while their physical\ncharacteristics have atrophied.\n\n\"Except for atavists like Jokan, the overly curious longing for the\nmale body, as you represent it, has been conditioned out of the\nreaction patterns by the psycho-medics by centuries of selection.\nJokan, as you have seen, is different. She demanded that I go back\nto your time, or even further back and return with a man capable of\nmatching her body in physical attraction. You enraged her for a\nmoment, but she has recovered from that momentary emotional unbalance.\"\n\n\n\nI objected at this point. \"But you said I was to be just a laboratory\nspecimen for dissection.\"\n\n\"This whole transaction was elaborate and demanded official sanction\nfrom the Council. So, on the record, your space-time teleportation is\nonly for biological purposes. You understand.\"\n\nI nodded. It was not an exceptional situation, basically. It seemed\nthat a few million years of evolution can't destroy the fundamental\nbehavior patterns entirely. \"A good man's still hard to find?\"\n\nThe little scientist stared in blank affirmation. Then he said: \"I\ncould have chosen any number of men who could have satisfied Jokan's\ndemands, perhaps even more thoroughly than you. Don't you wonder\nwhy I singled you out? With your background in your world, and your\nideological concepts, you were the only one for me to chose--for my own\npurposes.\"\n\n\"Which are--\" I prompted.\n\n\"Neither of the preceding purposes are the basic ones for my asking you\nto return here with me. The real reason is that you must destroy Mohln.\"\n\nI stared. I turned everything over in my mind, then tried to say\ncalmly: \"Why? This is civilization and the apex of human progress for\nwhich I face death daily in my own time. Destroy it!\"\n\nI had begun to regard this little withered man as a first class\nfanatic, born of highly complicated and advanced psychological\nconflicts.\n\nHe said: \"When the Earth was enveloped in its final ice sheet, living\nas we demanded it ceased to be feasible. The pick of human mentality\nand physiognomy migrated here to Mohln. Here we began our great--what\nwe thought great--new and scientific social order. Yes, it's reached\na zenith all right. A zenith of decay and stagnation. Except for a\nfew scientists, Mohln is populated by mindless automatons. Beautiful,\nmindless women, and great brained, spineless men. They all exist in a\nfutile vacuum.\"\n\nI was watching him narrowly for signs of madness. He looked mad enough,\nbut his squeezed up face was unreadable. I said feebly: \"From what\nlittle experience I've had here, you seem to have reached a pretty\nultimate state of civilization.\"\n\n\"That is the great tragedy. There is no ultimate state. That is the\ngreat delusion which you must shatter. Everyone, societies, worlds, all\nseek an ultimate state. Change is the law, and there is no ultimate\nlaw. This world of Mohln thinks it has achieved an ultimate perfection.\nIt has, because of the delusion, only succeeded in stagnation. This\nsocial structure is neither alive nor dead, Ivan Allinger. It is\nstanding still. The ultimate futility is to be static.\"\n\n\"Then you refute yourself,\" I said, feeling for a sophistic insert.\n\"You have reached an ultimate something.\"\n\n\"Only movement is the ultimate goal. And change is success.\nAdvancement--progress is limitless. This culture of Mohln has reached\nan ultimate lostness. Only one action can shake it back onto the\npattern of change. The entire World-City of Mohln must be destroyed,\nreduced to chaos. Out of this chaos, by trial and error, the people\nof Mohln must be given the germ of incentive again, and forced by\nnecessity to fight their way back onto new roads of endeavor.\"\n\nI thought hard. I felt familiar struggles in my heart. I understood\nthis. My own life was dedicated, back in my own space and time, to this\nsame effort and goal--to stimulate progress, and change; to destroy all\nreactionary elements that might lead to permanence.\n\nHe followed my introspection with words. \"You fought in the great wars\nof your time against the reactionary forces that would have led your\nsociety into staticism and decay. You are devoting the present to the\nfurthering of the ideals of progress. Do you want to see all your work,\nand all the work of all your kind, of your own present, past and future\nend in--this?\"\n\nHe spread his withered arms about him, encompassing the whole of the\nWorld-City of Mohln.\n\n\"No,\" I heard myself muttering. \"No. I wouldn't want that. I would\nprevent it, if I could. But I demand more than your words to convince\nme that this magnificence of organization I see about me is the\nhopeless futility you are telling me it is.\"\n\n\"I will take you out into the city and show you,\" he said. \"But it is\nstrictly against the rules of the Council. And the few intellectuals,\nthe scientists and research technicians don't care anymore about the\ndisintegration of the order about them. In their own little worlds they\nfind something to work on, a stimulus, and they ignore everything else.\nLike Jokan.\"\n\n\n\nDraken led me out onto a balcony, and I saw--well, a word that might\ninspire somewhat explanatory suggestive visions of what I saw, in your\nown mind, could be the symbol, Utopia. It was an endlessly stretching\ncomposite of all social dreams.\n\nThe mauve lighting that softened the city like a beautiful mist. The\nmighty, gleaming plastic shells of buildings. Power hung at levels\nreaching high toward a translucent dome that covered the city. Tiers on\ntiers of splendidly designed walkways, tubeways and highways networked\nthe spaces between structures. And the air sang with music, more\nmagnificent than all the symphonies of my own time.\n\nI forgot the dizzying height, and almost stepped out into the exalting\nsplendor of it. There seemed no danger, as though it were all an\nendless soft cloud of enchantment into which I could sink, then float\nbuoyed up by dreams and music and shifting light....\n\nBut the little tugging fingers of Draken dragged me back.\n\n\"It is all false,\" he whispered. \"It is all delusion. Beneath all\nthis grandeur the lost puppets dance and sleep, but never live. These\nwords, which are the only words that make a social system worthy\nof continuation--curiosity, incentive, ambition, drive, longing,\ndissatisfaction--all meaningless here, all unknown to these pathetic\ntropisms. If you will come with me, you can see for yourself, and\nunderstand.\"\n\nI went with little Draken. I did see for myself. I understood....\n\nAnd Draken was entirely correct in all that he had said. This\nWorld-City of Mohln had achieved an ultimate--an ultimate lostness. It\nwas a magnificent hollow shell of a City. There were no people in it.\nAll the mighty wonder was lost to the semi-living marionettes that\nwandered through it. But it meant life to them, nevertheless. They\nnever had to exert a finger, nor expend the energy of one thousandth of\na gram of thinking energy to live. But the technocratic creations of\nlong preceding times, of even a few still working scientists, kept them\nalive. But they neither knew this, nor cared.\n\nThey were fed, clothed, bathed and even reborn by robots. They were put\nto sleep, awakened, vitalized, and exhausted by machines. They were\nparasitic non-entities, dependent on the machines that other, _vital_\nminds, had built.\n\nBack on the balcony, Draken continued in that squeaky, uncertain quaver\nof his:\n\n\"Everything here is done by robots. There are different castes of\nrobots. Their functional system is graduated up through ever lessening\nnumbers until it reaches what is only a master switch. One single\nswitch in this World-City, pushed too far--\" Draken looked at me\nsuggestively and added hoarsely:\n\n\"If the master switch was ever pushed too far, this entire\ncivilization, as you call it, would stop functioning with any set\nmechanical pattern. All the robots and machines and the system they\noperate would cease activity. There would be your chaos. There would\nbe the needed situation under which the unthinking slaves will have to\nthink for themselves, solve their own problems once again. Or die. I\nthink they will solve them. I have that much faith in them. They always\nhave. So far.\"\n\nIt was a statement on Draken's part. But it was really a question.\nWould I push that master switch--too far?\n\n\"Why haven't _you_ done this before?\" I asked. \"Why drag a man from\nanother world, a million years in the past, to do this simple thing?\"\n\nDraken lowered his head in the first display of real, understandable\nemotion I had seen in him. Shame. \"I can't,\" he said simply. \"I do\nnot have the will, the free will to do it. My intellect tells me it\nis the correct thing to do. But my psycho-conditioning has created an\ninsurmountable antipathy toward such an act.\"\n\nHis dried up monkey-like hands clenched into tiny impotent fists. \"Many\ntimes I have gone into that room and tried to pull that switch. But\neach time I have failed. I know now that I shall never be able to. No\none in this world could do it until you came. You can. Your age was a\ndynamic one, of destruction and construction, each inseparable from the\nother. You could do it, not only with ease, but with the satisfaction\nof knowing you were taking a necessary step forward in human progress.\nThe question is--will you?\"\n\n\n\nA lot of time clambered through my fogged mind then before I formulated\na logical sequence of thoughts that led to what seemed to me a logical\nreply.\n\n\"I believe I will,\" I finally answered slowly. \"I can't see that there\nis any other way out.\"\n\n\"Execution,\" a familiarly brittle voice said behind me, and I turned.\nDraken began whimpering pathetically and cowered back against the\ncolonnade.\n\nJokan stood a few feet from me, wearing a thin, semi-transparent gown\nthat seemed anachronistic and out of place, as though she had gotten\nthe idea for it out of an old history book. Her body was a lithe shadow\nbehind it. But her eyes burned irrascible hatred.\n\n\"Execution for you, and for Draken; that is a better way.\"\n\n\"I wish I could agree,\" I said. \"But you see our concern is for society\nas a whole, rather than with a small minority that benefit from the\napathy and ignorance of the majority. For your satisfaction, and that\nof a few others, you may be right. Frankly, dear Jokan, though you're\nvery very lovely to look at, your mind is ugly and warped. And I would\nrather see you dead.\"\n\nI sprang and reached for her. She screamed once, before the robots came\nin and lumbered for me. I remember mumbling about the monotony of the\nrobot act; as she eluded me, and I eluded them. And I kept on trying to\ngrab Jokan. It was an obsession with me.\n\nA quick glance revealed Draken cowered down in his corner, his old\nchild's face twisted in stunned horror.\n\nMy only intention at that moment was to get my hands around Jokan's\nperfect neck just one more time. It was a mad, fanatical urge now. I\nhated her. I hated her with a blind madness.\n\nThe robots weren't nearly as dexterous as they should have been.\nPhysical encounter was undoubtedly alien to their primary purpose.\nThis place of Draken's was bigger, with a few articles in it, than the\nlaboratory had been. There were pneumatic chairs and couches and ray\nlamps and vitamin globes. I ducked, sprawled, ran and careened in and\nout of these rooms and around the strange looking fixtures. I, close\non Jokan's sandaled heels, and the robots close on mine. It might even\nseem more or less a comical scene in retrospect, but--\n\nThen I saw that silver sphere of Draken's, hanging in the air about\nfour feet from the floor, smooth, mysterious, but very suggestive. As I\nran back past Draken, I yelled at him.\n\nI doubt if Draken understood my words, he was so stricken with horror,\nbut he grasped my meaning, and somehow managed to stagger onto his\nquavering legs and tottered wild-eyed toward the sphere.\n\nBut Jokan understood my meaning, too. And through some telepathic\ndirection I still don't understand, she guided the robots onto poor\nDraken. Draken never had a chance.\n\nI don't think he even comprehended conflict. He could neither fight\nback, nor try to escape. It seemed that violence, either offensive or\ndefensive, was beyond his understanding. That was why he could not\nbring himself to pull the master switch that would have accomplished\nhis desired destruction of Mohln. That was also the reason why the\nrobot was able to take him into its inexorable metal arms and crush him\ninto something not far removed from pulp.\n\nHis delicate, deep pocketed eyes looked beseechingly into mine, once.\nThen the tremendous pressure bulged them horribly and unconsciously at\nme. His bony arms flapped and waved spasmodically and blood spurted\nfrom his small almost invisible ears and equally minute nose. Then\nhis whole frail body seemed to crack through the middle and deflate.\nAt another telepathic command from Jokan, the robot's arms raised and\nunbent, and the body of Draken thudded on the inlaid floor.\n\nI heard myself yelling. I wasn't retreating from the other two robots\nthen, or trying to get away at all. Something gave way inside me.\nWhat I had seen just now shocked every sense that might have been\nethical or moral in me. One word churned inside my brain. The word was\nrevenge. And then another word was added to it that seemed better.\nCompensation. Then another word etched in capital letters overshadowed\nand encompassed the other two. _Kill._\n\n\n\nThe first robot reached out with its very utilitarian and\ngadget-studded arms to rake me in. I had no idea how much the monster\nweighed. But the Frankensteinian creation was off balance as it reached\nfor me. I twisted and grasped the metalic tentacle, heaved forward,\nthrowing my hip into the gleaming stomach and heaved down.\n\nThe robot seemed light-weighted enough as it flew ceilingward, and\nclanged hollowly against the wall. There was a flash of current, a\nslight odor of ozone as the teleo-electronic man twitched about at my\nfeet.\n\nThe violence evidently stunned my fair and wicked Circe. Her telepathic\ncontrol over the remaining robots faltered and in that instant I seized\nher. A dead, hot rage swelled through my head and heart so I could\nhardly draw a breath. I wrenched at her neck, felt it crack dangerously\nand felt her long sleek muscles tremble against mine.\n\nI felt almost bestial in the power of my rage. I twisted sidewise\nand felt her body give, and heard her breath coming in short jagged\nwhines like a dog's. Her finger nails weren't clawing now. The cold,\nemotionless cruelty of her eyes was dying behind fear and indecision.\nShe hadn't been reluctant to dream of blood and guts and shattered\nbones, but too much of the real thing hurt even her atavistic senses.\n\n\"Keep them off me,\" I said in her ear. She tried to pull away. I held\nher at arm's length and began slapping her. Her face was white as\npowder until red finger marks appeared on it. I hit harder and her\nperfect upper lip split and a narrow line of blood ran down and stained\nthe dark hollow between her perfect marble breasts. The gold-flecked\npupils of her eyes widened, and the horror deepened in back of them.\nThe the horror went out like a flame and the lids with the perfect long\nlashes blinked over them and tears flowed down as from a weeping statue.\n\nI threw a quick circuit about the room. The robots were immobile;\ntensed, though, for action. At any moment Jokan might regain her Circe\nfaculties and summon them, even if it meant her own life. I didn't know\nthen what emotions surged around inside her strange heart. I lifted her\nonto my shoulder and started through the rooms.\n\nI had no idea how to escape. Whatever inconceivable manner the walls\ndissolved through the manipulation of incredible advanced force\nfields, I of course didn't know. But I put three rooms filled with the\nfuturistic mores between myself and the robot minions of Jokan before I\ndropped her on a pneumatic couch and wrapped my hands about her throat\nfor the third time and began to squeeze.\n\nI began slowly and methodically, looking all the time into her eyes.\nThen I saw it. I saw the real depths of her eyes, and a shock trembled\nthrough me. Jokan had changed. How she had changed!\n\nShe read the implacable purpose in my eyes that I felt in my heart, and\nas her arms came up, mine slid down softly from about her throat. I\nkissed her. I lifted her passive softness up and felt it respond. The\nhands with the feral nails caressed the back of my neck, and her lips\nwere hungry.\n\nI had seen in her eyes a change, and had answered it. Then I said:\n\"Lead me to the room that holds the master switch. Then we'll go.\"\n\nShe slid out of my arms languidly and onto her feet. She leaned toward\nme, and her fingers grasped mine. They were warm, not cold; how could\nthey ever have been cold? \"Go where?\"\n\n\"Can you run that space-time apparatus that brought me here?\"\n\nShe nodded, then looked fearfully over my face.\n\n\"Take me to the main switch,\" I repeated.\n\nWe went back, and she somehow attracted the translucent, yet not\ntranslucent, sphere to her side. It followed after her like a monstrous\nbeing, a cosmic slave.\n\nShe led me toward the wall and it dissolved. I still am not able to\nunderstand the phenomenon. We continued through and into an elevator.\nWe dropped down through a blur of distance. She led me through a\nglowing tunnel and into a tubecar and there was a dim sensation of\nmovement in which we might have sped a thousand miles, or ten thousand.\n\nShe led me out of the tubecar and we crossed a walkway, where lines\nof listless people stood moving in various directions. The little\nswollen-headed men and the tall austere but listless women. They were\nall going places, but it didn't matter. They had eyes, ears, senses,\nbut they might have been machines reacting through photo-electric\ndevices. I thirsted for the main switch that would send them all into\nblind chaos. It was a hellish thing for the world I had risked my life\nmany times to build upward and progressively toward greatness. But it\nhad all ended here, a blind alley of despair, and the hell I planned\nwould be its only salvation.\n\nSuddenly, from all sides, robots converged on us, directed by a number\nof the little white-skulled men with velvet togas flapping about\nslug-white spindly legs.\n\n\"The Council,\" said Jokan. \"They are afraid now. They attack, and they\nare half mad because they have been conditioned that such an act of\nviolence is atavism, the inexcusable social crime.\"\n\n\n\nTheir puckered faces, in the center of the bloated domes of heads,\nwere strained and flinching. The robots shambled onto Jokan and me,\nand Jokan did something to them with her mind which evidently was more\npowerful in this capacity at least than all the Council combined. And\nthe robots turned and began flailing each other into lumps of smoking\ntwisted metal.\n\nMy stomach crawled. The Council, supreme intellects of a million years\nof progress, had fallen down onto the moving walkway, slobbering and\ntwitching in the final stages of dementia. Even a thousand gram brain\nbreaks when faced with an insolvable problem. The gleaming expanse of\nmoving plastic carried the Council out of our sight. The little men and\nthe Amazonian women who slouched past didn't even notice. And if they\ndid, it was foreign to their conditioning. They couldn't think about it.\n\nThey would soon have to think. When I pushed the master switch too\nfar....\n\nWe encountered no more resistance, if that feeble expression of the\napex of human development so far met could be called resistance.\nFinally we emerged into a room that surprised me with its lack of\ngrandeur and its barrenness. All the World-City that was meaningless\nwas a dream of ostentation and color and beauty of intricate design.\nThis room, in contrast, the heart of the World-City, the key to its\nlife, was completely denuded. A small plastic shell and in the middle\nwas a conical dais and on the dais was a lever.\n\nJokan nodded toward the lever and her eyes that followed me as I\nwalked to it and moved it, were bright with some inner fire I couldn't\ndiagnose.\n\nI jerked my hand away.\n\nThe meaning of my act enveloped me in a mist of fear. I trembled\nviolently. Sweat beaded on my face and smarted in my eyes.\n\nHad I been right in my choice? Had Draken been correct in his analysis,\nand had I been justified in jumping to such an empirical conclusion\nwithout more conclusive proof? Had all these nameless slaves of decay\nbeen victims of the delusion from which I had freed them? Or had I been\ndeluded by the lies of a fanatic?\n\nI looked down and saw my hand reaching for the lever to move it back.\nIt was an unconscious gesture motivated by vague fears. I seemed such a\nlittle man to destroy a world.\n\nWhat was happening to all animated puppets of this future society now\nthat its mechanical contrivances had been destroyed? What had happened,\neven back in my own time, in large cities, when only the electric\nsystems had been blown up, or the water mains, or gas mains? What\nmind-numbing chaos and madness must be developing around me as I stood\ninside the heart of a world which I had torn loose from its arteries.\n\nJokan led me from the room and onto a balcony. Somehow I had thought\nmyself down far in the bowels of this World-City. But as I stepped out,\nclouds were on a level with my eyes, synthetic clouds, and wind slapped\nmy face. We looked down.\n\nBlind in that room with only my imaginative thoughts, the vastness\nof my act had been a conceivable thing. Here, looking over the\ntrue vastness, an endlessness, I found my brain whirling, refusing\nto consider what was really happening. In a monody of sadness and\nfatalism, Jokan recited the meaning to me, as she watched her world\ncrumble.\n\nA sound surged up and about me. A low murmuring that grew and expanded\ninto a vibrating roar. To my right, far away, I saw a massive steely\nstructure explode into a billion fragments and a blinding flash of\npower carried to my ears a splitting roar. It began happening all over,\nthrough the tiers and levels and towering heights of the World-City, as\nfar on any side I looked, as far as I could see.\n\nI cringed. Below, a sea of blind ants scurried madly about in infantile\nterror. Flying boats crashed as their automatic pilots stopped\nfunctioning. All the power of the city had ceased. The smoothly working\nmachinery had become an onrushing nemesis of destruction, each stride\nfeeding on the preceding flaw in function or the complete lack of any\nfunction.\n\nHuge structures, power-hung, dropped their millions of tons of weight\nonto hordes of milling humans who had no idea what was happening--if\nthey had ever known.\n\nGravity neutralizing units died and whole tiers collapsed. Unlimited\npower from the harnessing of liquid oxygen reversed into a destructive\ntitan; a wave of overpowering heat rose up in a choking mist. Then the\nbuilding on which we stood began to tremble.\n\nI turned. The bobbing sphere of escape was between Jokan and I, a\nsmall supremely compact unit of atomic power, perhaps, conducting its\nown motivation. \"Why doesn't it stop, too?\" I asked, as people ask\nambiguous questions in a crisis.\n\n\"It responds to the human mind alone,\" she said. \"We have progressed\nfar in physiogenics, too, as well as in the mechanical sciences.\nPerhaps it is the real world after all. We can go far beyond the\nmachines.\"\n\n\"We'd better go someplace--fast,\" I said shakily, for the building\nlurched sickeningly, and I toppled back against the wall. The colonnade\nbuckled in front of me, but Jokan wasn't afraid. She kept looking over\nthe World-City.\n\nI stumbled toward her. The heat was intensifying, becoming intolerable.\nI clutched at her frantically. \"You are going with me,\" I shouted. I\ndoubt if she heard me. \"I love you,\" I yelled into her ear. \"Don't you\nunderstand?\" She heard that. Her lips smiled thinly. Pain altered her\nface like a plastic mask.\n\nI felt the gigantic power of the sphere then as before. It began to\nglow and oscillate and expand. And it sucked me into its limitless\ndepths and cosmological labyrinths as before. I felt the melting and\nflowing and the indescribable twisted warping of sanity....\n\n\n\nJokan, working at my side, has done much to conquer the evil virus\nof the Spartan menace. Her scientific knowledge, and her telepathic\nacumen, place her above many of our greatest minds. This is enhanced by\nan almost fanatical desire to destroy those who would destroy social\nprogress. Her faithfulness to duty is legendary.\n\nWe love each other with ties no one can understand who hesitate to\nconceive of bonds extending through dimensions of space and time. She\nnever leaves my side in the unceasing night and day, crusading against\nthe Fascistic disease that is being stamped out, though painfully and\nwith aching slowness, that has extended over six centuries.\n\nBut between us there is an uneasiness. Sometimes this uneasiness finds\nexpression in little episodes--like the conversation at the last\nmeeting of the International Agencies in Casablanca. We were having\ndrinks before going into the Presidium.\n\nJokan was lovely--that's a dismal understatement--in a low cut evening\ngown of plasti-silk. Her eyes were half closed.\n\n\"Will we ever win?\" she said over the brim of a Tom Collins, which is\nstill the world's favorite cocktail.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. Then I turned casually, though I didn't feel casual at\nall. I knew what she was thinking.\n\n\"You must be the greatest optimist of all time,\" she said. \"And I'll\nhelp you and myself and all of us stay that way. I'll never mention it\nagain. Perhaps we can both forget.\"\n\n\"Try to forget what?\" I said, though I knew well enough.\n\nHer eyes fixed mine as only her eyes can. \"Forget that the great world\nwe're fighting so hard to build we will be destroying a million years\nfrom tonight.\"\n\nI coughed and ordered another drink for myself. But I can't forget.",
