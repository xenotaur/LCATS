    "body": "\u201cLodestone, you flea-bitten, long-eared ancestor of a jack-rabbit,\ntake a look at the best place the Lord ever made, and rejoice with\nme.\u201d\n\nLodestone wiggles his ears, kicks at a hoss-fly, narrowly missing my\nhead, and looks with sad eyes down at the city of Piperock. Then he\ngoes to sleep. Which shows that a burro ain\u2019t got no finer feelings.\n\nWe been away for quite a while\u2014me and Lodestone. We pilgrims up the\nBitter Root range to where old Blue Nose sticks into the clouds,\ncrosses over and pilgrims back the other side, all of which takes up\nseveral months, and don\u2019t net me nothing but blisters and blasphemy.\n\nI misses \u201cMagpie\u201d Simpkins a heap, and I welcomes the day when I can\nshake the hand of that long, loose-jointed hombre. Magpie is one of\nthe leading citizens of Piperock, and until a few months ago, my\npardner.\n\nWhen I left to make my fortune he was setting there in his\noffice\u2014Magpie is the sheriff\u2014and wondering how he can square things\nwith the populace to get reelected.\n\nHe\u2019s of the lodge-pole type, and wears a goodly length of hair on his\nupper lip. He pleads with me not to leave him but for once in my life\nI turns a deaf ear to his siren voice, and herds my burro out of\nhearing.\n\nPiperock ain\u2019t what a stranger would call a paradise on earth, and she\ndon\u2019t qualify for the milk and honey, but she\u2019s a man\u2019s town\u2014all up\nand down the street.\n\nMe and Lodestone pilgrims through the dust up to \u201cBuck\u201d Masterson\u2019s\nsaloon, and I goes inside. Buck and \u201cTellurium\u201d are there, and they\nwelcomes me like a lost brother. Buck salutes me with the proper\ningredients, and we exchanges pleasantries.\n\nAfter we sort of gets used to each other again Buck hauls out a sheet\nof paper, and smooths it out on the bar.\n\n\u201cTake a look at that, Ike,\u201d says he. \u201cThere\u2019s something new.\u201d\n\nI sizes her up. It\u2019s what resembles a newspaper\u2014in some respects\u2014but I\ncan\u2019t seem to read it none to speak of. The label across the top\nresembles this\u2014\n\n                          TOLIP KCOREPIP EHT\n\nThe rest of the page is smears and blots.\n\n\u201cLooks like a Russian proclamation, Buck,\u201d says I. \u201cWhere did it come\nfrom?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight here, Ike; that ex-pardner of yours published it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMagpie?\u201d I asks, and they both nods. \u201cThat\u2019s his first edition,\u201d\nreplies Buck. \u201cHe took over the office when a few of the local boys\nran the editor across the border for slandering the community. That\npaper invades this here country about a month after you leaves, and\nshe runs high along until the editor gets a call to uplift the\ncommunity. Yesterday he beat the posse across the line, and Magpie\ngets out his maiden sheet. This here feller speaks feelingly of\nlawlessness, and even goes so far as to make personal remarks about\nour morals. What he said about the town of Paradise was awful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Magpie still sheriff?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d admits Tellurium, who ain\u2019t friendly with Magpie. \u201cAbe\nAnderson was running against him, and had a grand chance to win, but\nAbe\u2019s old weakness crops up and spoils things.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbe seen a chance to run off some Circle Star cows,\u201d explains Buck.\n\u201cHe runs foul of Magpie and three of the Circle Star punchers, and\nwhen they gets through convincing him that, \u2018Thou shalt not steal,\u2019 he\nain\u2019t in shape to use votes. Magpie races alone and is elected by five\nvotes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d says I, \u201ca few months sure does change the map. I\u2019ll go\ndown and see if that benighted son of a lodge-pole don\u2019t need some\nhelp.\u201d\n\nI prods Lodestone down the street to where I sees a sign, which\nproclaims there\u2019s a newspaper office. I hitches my rolling stock and\ngoes inside. Magpie is there. All I can see is the bottom of his\nboots, the seat of his pants and his elbows\u2014the rest of him is behind\na newspaper, as he leans back in a chair, with his feet on the table.\n\nI leans against the table and rolls a smoke. He glances at me,\nswitches his cigaret over to the other side of his mouth, and goes on\ntrying to read. I say \u201ctrying to read\u201d for the reason that he\u2019s got a\npaper he printed himself.\n\nPretty soon he yawns and lays the paper across his knees.\n\n\u201cIke,\u201d says he, \u201cthat\u2019s some paper.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome ink, too, if that\u2019s anything to brag about,\u201d I replies. \u201cWhen\ndid you learn to write Russian? Maybe it\u2019s Chinook with the blind\nstaggers, Magpie, but anyway she\u2019s a terrible language. What does them\nbig letters at the top proclaim?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat? Huh! _The Piperock Pilot_!\u201d\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t the letters run the other way, Magpie?\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckon they would, Ike, but how in \u2014\u2014 am I going to know what she\nreads? It\u2019s a danged sight easier for the public to read the print\nbackwards than it is for me to read the type thataway. I\u2019m glad to see\nyuh, Ike.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill follering the line of least resistance, eh, Magpie? I\u2019m glad to\nsee you, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccumulate anything on your trip, Ike?\u201d\n\n\u201cWood-ticks, fool-hens and a growing conviction that rich rock is\nscarce. How\u2019s things at the sheriff\u2019s office?\u201d\n\n\u201cTolable, Ike. Won by a narrow majority. I reckon if Abe had \u2019a\u2019 lived\nwe\u2019d needed a recount. Lot of folks voted for him after he was dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey would,\u201d I agrees. \u201cLot of folks around here ain\u2019t got no more\nambition than to vote for a corpse. How comes it you\u2019re a editor? Has\nall the bad-men died off or has a moral wave hit Piperock?\u201d\n\n\u201cI always been a critter of circumstance, Ike,\u201d he states, unfolding\nhis long legs, and easing his gun handy-like. \u201cI always been a\ndisciple of advance, and I\u2019ve worn all the skin off my shoulder trying\nto give the wheels of progress a lift. At times them wheels have\nslipped and sprained my immediate future, but I never peeped.\n\n\u201cWhen this here misguided editor fades across the horizon, me, being\nsheriff, appropriates this here plant and opines to run it as a public\ninstitution. There\u2019s twenty-five sheets of paper left and one can of\nink. My first edition takes twelve sheets, and I hereby claims that a\nman, without no experience, what can rise to the occasion and put out\na paper like that is a credit to the community.\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you have trouble finding all them letters, Magpie?\u201d\n\n\u201cTrouble? Say, the ends of my fingers are so tender I can hold out my\nhands and feel the sun slide behind the hills. The next publication is\nproblematical, Ike. I\u2019m short of material, but I only figures on one\nmore issue. I got a article set up, and I can\u2019t publish until the time\nis ripe.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething special?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh. \u2018Tombstone\u2019 Todd\u2019s obituary.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom Wilier Crick?\u201d I asks, and Magpie nods.\n\n\u201cUh-huh. Him and \u2018Cactus\u2019 Collins comes over here to help elect Abe\nAnderson, being as Abe was a relative. When Abe departs this here vale\nof tears they up and proclaims they\u2019re a pair of howling wolves, and\nthat they\u2019re a permanent fixture around here until such a time as they\nlays me on my back and gestures over me with a spade. Awful pair of\ngobblers, Ike.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not an obituary for Cactus, too, Magpie?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s hiding out until such a time as his stummick is normal, Ike. He\nhorns in on me yesterday, and gets pessimistic to my face. I\u2019m busy on\nthat obituary and don\u2019t like to be interrupted, so I beats him on the\ndraw, accepts his gun as a subscription and induces him to eat a\nbucket of paste. Awful smelling mess, Ike. I\u2019d opine that as far as my\nfuture horoscope is concerned his lips are sealed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThirteen sheets and one obituary will be something to print,\u201d says I.\n\u201cHas Tombstone made any advances?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce. I was standing over there by the window, holding up one of them\ndinguses what contains type, when a bullet comes along and hits her\nplumb center. She collapses right there and ruins things. Some of that\nlead type enters my bosom, and for the space of a foot square on my\nmanly chest I looks like a smallpox patient. This idea of being a man\nof letters ain\u2019t no prosaic pastime, Ike.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nJust then \u201cScenery\u201d Sims darkens our doorway. Scenery is knee-high to\na short Injun, and his voice hankers for oil. He looks mean-like at me\nand Magpie, and chaws some industrious. Pretty soon he expectorates\ncopiously on the floor, and orates\u2014\n\n\u201cWant to quit taking the paper.\u201d\n\nMagpie snaps out his gun and covers Scenery.\n\n\u201cGet down on your knees and wipe out that \u2014\u2014 spot!\u201d snorts Magpie.\n\u201cWhat do yuh think this is\u2014a corral?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014uh\u2014\u201d begins Scenery, but the gun don\u2019t waver, so he takes the\nhandkerchief off his neck, and scrubs our floor.\n\n\u201cThis is a newspaper office, Scenery,\u201d states Magpie. \u201cYou can\u2019t start\nyour oration with a cloud-burst in here. Sabe? What you got against\nthe paper, and why for don\u2019t yuh wish it no more?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t read her,\u201d he squeaks. \u201cShe\u2019s too backward to suit me. Of\ncourse I\u2014uh\u2014well, send her along, and I\u2019ll\u2014uh\u2014do the best I can. I got\nto go now.\u201d\n\nHe slips out with his hat in his hand, and lopes off up the street.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s business, Ike,\u201d laughs Magpie. \u201cI\u2019m going to make \u2019em like\nit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen yuh had the drop on him yuh ought to \u2019a \u2019collected in advance\nfor another year,\u201d says I. \u201cYou sure need a manager, Magpie, for _The\nPiperock Pilot, Limited_\u2014to thirteen sheets and a death notice.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowdy, gents,\u201d states a voice at the door. \u201cIs this the only\nnewspaper in town?\u201d\n\nThat person is a novelty in cowland. He stands there, exuding perfume\nand prosperity from his Sunday clothes. We looks him over, from his\nshiny shoes to his hard hat, wonders at his pink cheeks, which match\nhis necktie, and both nods.\n\n\u201cYou answers your own question, stranger,\u201d states Magpie. \u201cWe sure got\na monopoly on all news hereabouts. Want to subscribe?\u201d\n\nHe ambles over and sets down on a stool and looks the place over. He\ntakes off his hat, balances it on his knee, and produces some sheets\nof paper.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your amusement rates?\u201d he asks. \u201cHalf-page\u2014maybe full.\u201d\n\nMagpie rolls a fresh smoke and studies the feller.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he drawls, \u201cthe person who operates here ahead of me makes a\nfixed price of three dollars for six months, but I don\u2019t sabe no case\nin which he split the size. I don\u2019t guarantee to amuse nobody. I\u2019ll be\nhonest with yuh, though. This here paper is on its last legs, but I\u2019ll\ndanged near guarantee one more issue, and if yuh hankers for it I\u2019ll\nput yuh down for one copy at four-bits.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou misunderstood me,\u201d he grins, \u201cI mean advertising rates. I\u2019m ahead\nof \u2018Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe puts his hat back on his head, and shuffles them sheets of paper:\n\n\u201cWe are bringing to your town the greatest aggregation of stars that\never glowed over one set of footlights. Two _Evas_, two _Topsies_,\nthree fee-rocious bloodhounds and eight\u2014\u201d\n\n_Splang!_\n\nThe side window spills its panes over the place, and this person\u2019s hat\nflips off his head, and lands in my lap, while a chunk of lead bores a\nneat hole in the wall behind the stranger. He freezes right there.\n\nMagpie slips his gun across his lap, settles down a little lower in\nhis chair, and lights his cigaret. I hands the hat back to its owner,\nand slides my chair a few inches further back.\n\n\u201cEight what?\u201d asks Magpie.\n\n\u201cCa-ca-cakes of ice,\u201d he quavers, examining his hat. \u201cMy \u2014\u2014! Was that\na\u2014a\u2014bullet?\u201d\n\nMagpie nods and scratches his chin.\n\n\u201cBullet?\u201d he wonders again. \u201cDid\u2014did somebody shoot at me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d says Magpie. \u201cAt me. What yuh going to do with the ice?\u201d\n\nHe looks at Magpie for a minute, and then gasps\u2014\n\n\u201cAt a\u2014a time like this?\u201d\n\nHe tucks his hat under his arm, sneaks to the door, and goes around\nthe corner so fast his coat simply cracks.\n\nMagpie slips his gun loose and spins the cylinder, hitches up his belt\nand yawns:\n\n\u201cIke, I ain\u2019t got nothing to prove who it was but I has the feeling\nthat Tombstone is going too danged far. There\u2019s such a thing as\npersonal animosity, but when yuh bust into a man\u2019s business and cause\nhim financial loss it\u2019s time to start a probe. That show person was\nabout to help us pay our overhead expenses, but now he\u2019s gone gun-shy.\n\n\u201cI hereby deputizes you to operate this here plant, while I fulfils\nthe obligations of my oath concerning public nuisances. You got plenty\nof ammunition, Ike?\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t no editor, Magpie,\u201d I objects. \u201cI can\u2019t even sign my own name\nso folks can read it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSign mine,\u201d says he. \u201cYou\u2019re editor _pro tempore_. Sabe?\u201d And then he\nslips out of the door.\n\nI looks around, casual-like, places my .41 beside me on a chair, and\nsets down out of line with any window or door. It\u2019s warm in there, and\nthere\u2019s a funny smell about the place. I had several scoops of gall\nand wormwood in Buck\u2019s place, and the combination woos sleep in\ncopious gobs. My sombrero slips over my face, and I sleep.\n\nSudden-like I wakes, and believe me she\u2019s a rude awakening. Somebody\nkicks the chair out from under me, and proceeds to knead my abdomen\nwith their knees, toes, fingers, thumbs and head. When that part is\nover they turns me on my face and rakes me fore and aft with a pair of\nlong-roweled spurs, while they links their hands in my hair and\nhammers my forehead on the floor. When I ain\u2019t got more than a glimmer\nof light left in my system they seems to draw aside and rest.\n\n\u201cThere!\u201d I hears a voice state. \u201cNext time yuh prints your danged\nnewspaper you\u2019ll please leave my name out. Sabe? I ain\u2019t no shepherd,\nand my shirt is as clean as yours!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Dirty Shirt\u2019 Jones, you\u2019re an assassin,\u201d says I, weak-like.\n\nHe pulls my hat off the bridge of my nose and takes a look at me.\n\n\u201cIke, I\u2019m glad to see yuh back,\u201d says he. \u201cWhen did yuh get back?\u201d\n\n\u201cToday. Are you the reception committee?\u201d\n\n\u201cMe? Nope. I\u2019m an enraged citizen, Ike. I mistook yuh for the editor.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo mistake, Dirty, I\u2019m him.\u201d\n\nOf course I got that .41 in my hands when I makes that statement, and\nDirty don\u2019t make no demonstration.\n\n\u201cTake it easy,\u201d I advises. \u201cI ain\u2019t the one you\u2019re sore at. Magpie is\nthe regular editor but he\u2019s down at the jail.\u201d\n\nDirty chaws for a few seconds, and hitches up his pants:\n\n\u201cMuch obliged, Ike. Sorry I licked yuh thataway. Yuh see that paper\norates that the population ought to get sanitary\u2014whatever that is. He\nstates that a dirty shirt designates a shepherd\u2014dang his hide! Well,\nIke, I gives yuh good afternoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood afternoon ain\u2019t much to give a man after you\u2019ve give him \u2014\u2014,\u201d I\nopines. \u201cBut I\u2019ll take it, Dirty, old-timer. I reckon I\u2019ll need\neverything I can get before I goes to press.\u201d\n\nI sets there and complains bitterly to myself about folks who don\u2019t\nkeep up to date on news, wipes the worst of the ink off my face, and\ngoes back to sleep.\n\n\u201cSlim\u201d Hawkins woke me up. Slim would make a good running-mate for\nMagpie. He\u2019s built in the same proportions. He\u2019s had a few drinks, and\nis as serious as a owl.\n\n\u201cIke,\u201d says he, \u201ctake a look at my eyes and see if they\u2019re all right.\u201d\n\n\u201cLittle off color but pointing straight, Slim. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody drops a paper at the ranch today, and when I tries to peruse\nsame I finds that I\u2019m left-handed and cross-eyed. I\u2019ve suffered a\nheap, Ike, and while I hopes for the best I fears the worst. I\u2019d hate\nto go around looking at things backwards thataway. Might as well learn\nto read Chinese. Where\u2019s the educated party what operates this here\nnewspaper?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s\u2014\u201d I begins, but an apparition which I deciphers to be Dirty\nShirt, comes in the door.\n\nHe seems to have met disaster. His hair has been pawed down over a\npair of black eyes, and over his head and under one arm hangs what is\nleft of a framed map of Montana, which adorned Magpie\u2019s office.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe feels painfully in his pockets, takes out three silver dollars, and\nlays \u2019em on the table.\n\n\u201cDirty Shirt Jones\u2014three months,\u201d he states, slow and sad-like.\n\n\u201cYour subscription expired?\u201d I asks, and he nods.\n\n\u201cUh-huh. I reckon. Everything else has.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter take back some of it,\u201d I advises. \u201cThis here paper is about to\ncease. One more effort cleans the rack.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d nods Dirty Shirt. \u201cKeep the money and send me a copy. If\nMagpie can edit like he can fight I\u2019ll covet that copy.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep that frame to put it in,\u201d says I. \u201cYou met the editor, did yuh?\u201d\n\nDirty squints at me, adjusts that frame to a easier position, and rubs\nhis sore eyes.\n\n\u201cMet him!\u201d he snorts. \u201cMet \u2014\u2014! We mingled!\u201d\n\nDirty weaves out of the door and points up the street. Slim looks at\nthem three dollars and then lays three more beside \u2019em.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t sabe the game, Ike, but I\u2019m matching Dirty\u2019s ante. I don\u2019t\nknow what Magpie\u2019s argument is, but anybody what can make Dirty Shirt\npay three dollars for a left-handed newspaper must have something\nbesides conversation.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Dirty Shirt was sore,\u201d says I. \u201cHe came down to lick the editor.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe, too, Ike. I came with malice in my heart but I goes away plumb\nmeek. Dirty Shirt licked thunder out of me once, so I\u2019m three dollars\nthankful that he met Magpie first. Have a little drink?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the first United States I\u2019ve heard spoken since I got home,\u201d\nsays I. \u201cBut I can\u2019t leave the office alone. You go up and have one,\nand then play editor while I goes up. Sabe?\u201d\n\nSlim comes back in a few minutes, and holds down the place while I\npilgrims up to Buck\u2019s place. Me and Buck and \u201cHalf-Mile\u201d Smith leans\non the door and discusses local conditions.\n\n\u201cShow troupe in town,\u201d states Half-Mile. \u201cCame in on the stage. Seven\nor eight people, two colored persons and some dogs. They got a drum\nand a lot of horns, etcetery. I\u2019d opine we\u2019ll have some music.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love a good show,\u201d says Buck. \u201cThe last good one I seen was at\nSilver Bend. They played Shakespeare. Had a ghost and I was just drunk\nenough to enjoy it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me a drink, quick!\u201d pants a voice at the door, and into the\nplace comes \u201cRicky\u201d Henderson. He takes a long drink out of the\nbottle, and leans against the bar.\n\n\u201cSuffering surcingles!\u201d he pants. \u201cI\u2019ve sure had one job! That or\u2019nary\nhombre, Tombstone Todd, comes into my place a while ago, and climbs\ninto a chair.\n\n\u201c\u2018Young feller,\u2019 says he, \u2018my hair and whiskers are too noticeable, so\nI admires to see \u2019em on the floor.\u2019 He hauls out a six-gun, lays it\nacross his lap, and leans back in the chair. \u2018Young feller,\u2019 says he\nagain, \u2018a razor what pulls is an abomination and a barber what uses\none is flirting with the undertaker. Let your judgment be your\nguide.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWas he satisfied?\u201d asks Buck.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here, ain\u2019t I?\u201d grins Ricky. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t do it again for a\nmillion dollars.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you with a razor in your hand all this time, and his head tilted\nback?\u201d wonders Half-Mile, aloud.\n\nRicky stares at Half-Mile and considers the remark.\n\n\u201cI seen a colored brother with a razor once\u2014\u201d began Half-Mile, but he\nhappens to glance towards the door.\n\nWe all takes a look.\n\n\u201cSpeak of the devil and\u2014\u201d murmurs Buck, but the colored person at the\ndoor bursts into profanity that would shame a professor from a mule\ncollege.\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t yuh come back, Ike?\u201d he wails. \u201cSus-somebody sneaked in,\nhit me over the head, dud-dragged me into the back room and poured a\ncan of ink all over me! My \u2014\u2014! It won\u2019t never come off! He said he\nwanted to make me eat some paste, but he couldn\u2019t find it. Look at me!\nAll inked to \u2014\u2014!\u201d\n\n\u201cGosh!\u201d exclaims Magpie from the doorway. \u201cAin\u2019t that too danged bad!\nThat\u2019s the only can of ink there was left.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo bad, eh?\u201d howls Slim. \u201cI wish I knowed the name of that hombre.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he speak feelingly of paste?\u201d asks Magpie.\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d agrees Slim, drawing figures on the bar with his inky\nfinger. \u201cHe sort of choked over the word. He \u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHey! Sam!\u201d yells a voice at the door, and we observes a stranger in\nour midst.\n\nIt\u2019s sort of dark inside, but he seems to know what he wants. He\nambles straight up to Slim, and grabs him by the arm.\n\n\u201cYou slew-footed, wobble-jointed son of a cannibal!\u201d he yelps.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s them pink silk underclothes of mine, eh?\u201d\n\nSlim Hawkins is slow to anger, but when he does get to going he\u2019s hard\nto stop. He climbs under and over and through this stranger like he\nwas searching for something, and when he gets through this feller\nain\u2019t got nothing on but a look of wonderment and one sleeve of his\nundershirt. Slim looks over the pile of clothes on the floor, and\nshakes his head.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t find \u2019em,\u201d he states, serious-like. \u201cFurthermore I don\u2019t\nadmire to be called a son of a cannibal, Mister Man!\u201d\n\nThe feller braces his hands behind him on the floor, and shakes his\nhead like he was trying to collect his thoughts. He squints at Slim,\nand then explodes:\n\n\u201cMy \u2014\u2014! You ain\u2019t Sam!\u201d\n\n\u201cA slight inquiry would have saved us all this search,\u201d says Slim.\n\u201cWho is Sam?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of my company\u2014my _Uncle Tom_.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d drawled Slim. \u201cYou with this here \u2018Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin\u2019 outfit?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d says he. \u201cI\u2019m _Simon Legree_.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\nSlim picks the gent up by one leg and an arm, carries him out and\ndumps him right into the street without no clothes on.\n\n\u201cThere!\u201d yells Slim, as the stranger hits the dirt. \u201cI\u2019ve read all\nabout yuh, Mister Legree, and this is one colored person yuh can\u2019t run\nno sandy on. Sabe?\u201d\n\nThis Legree person don\u2019t linger. It\u2019s about two hundred yards to\nHolt\u2019s hotel door, and he negotiates the distance in the time it takes\nSlim to shoot six shots into the dirt behind him. On his way he meets\n\u201cCobalt\u201d Williams. Cobalt steps to one side to let him past, catches\nhis spur in the dirt, and sets down. It spoils his aim, he tears the\nknob off the door after it shuts behind Legree. Cobalt gets up and\ncomes on down to the saloon, shaking his head.\n\n\u201cWhat yuh trying to do\u2014kill him? Yuh danged fool!\u201d snorts Slim.\n\nCobalt had reached for the bottle, but he turns to look at Slim and\nhis hand drops. He pushes his hat back and stares at Slim and seems to\nswaller with difficulty.\n\n\u201cEx-cuse me,\u201d he says, sort of to himself. \u201cNo more Paradise hooch for\nmine! Mike Pelly said it was a hundred and twenty proof, and this\nproves it. First I see a naked man running around the main street, and\nthen I meets a colored brother what looks like Slim Hawkins. I\u2019m\nthrough! Sabe? I\u2019m going home\u2014me!\u201d\n\nHe ducks out, gets his bronc at the rack and points out of town.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019d call a temperance lecture in ink,\u201d opines Magpie. \u201cAs\neditor and a man of letters I congratulates yuh. We can hereby reverse\nthat old saying, \u2018He who runs may read\u2019 and make it, \u2018He who reads may\nrun.\u2019\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe inaugurates a poker game and plays until almost dark, when\nsudden-like we hears the sound of music, and stampedes to the door.\nHere comes that show bunch down the street, and stops in front of the\nold Mint Hall. They got a banner what proclaims there will be a show\ntonight, and \u201cMighty\u201d Jones is packing the banner, with his chest\nstuck out like a fool-hen after a feed.\n\nWe cashes in and goes over to the band.\n\n\u201cWhen did you start to be a actor, Mighty?\u201d asks Magpie, but the\nfeller what Slim took apart steps between Magpie and Mighty and peers\nat Magpie\u2019s star.\n\n\u201cPardon me,\u201d says he, \u201cI see you\u2019re the sheriff.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re pardoned, and I congratulates yuh on your eyesight,\u201d replies\nMagpie.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost my dogs,\u201d says he. \u201cSomebody must \u2019a\u2019 stole \u2019em.\u201d\n\nBy this time most everybody in Piperock has congregated around. Music\nsure is a magnet for folks and dogs.\n\n\u201cPick out what yuh want,\u201d says Magpie, indicating any amount of\ncanines, circling around through people\u2019s legs. \u201cLosing a few dogs\nain\u2019t no disaster around here.\u201d\n\n\u201cMine are valuable dogs,\u201d states Legree, in a loud tone. \u201cTrained\ndogs. Our show can\u2019t proceed without them dogs.\u201d\n\n\u201cName, age and description,\u201d says Magpie, hauling out a little\nnote-book. \u201cAlso any distinguishing marks and brands.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne bloodhound, crossed with St. Bernard and collie; color, yaller;\nnamed Violet.\u201d\n\n\u201c_War-hoo-o-o-o!_\u201d howls a dog up the street.\n\n\u201c_Yeo-o-o-o-ow!_\u201d yells somebody. \u201cLook out!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a sudden movement at the far end of the congregation. I sees a\nbronc turn a handspring, a pair of cream-colored broncs leaves their\nhalters at the hitch-rack, while they comes over to visit us, and\nViolet is no longer a lost dog.\n\nViolet is about the size of a he-wolf, and she seems to think she can\noutrun the string of tomato cans which are tied to her tail. She goes\nthrough, under and over that crowd, and what she don\u2019t do to us is\nleft for that pair of broncs and the buckboard. A million dog-fights\nstart right there.\n\nMe and _Legree_ are close together and the confusion seems to bring us\nclose to each other. We hits the sidewalk together and I\u2019m underneath.\nA couple of rotten boards break, and yours truly disappears.\n\nWhen I recovers sufficient-like to peek out it\u2019s about all over. Every\nbronc that was tied to the rack is gone, and part of one rack is\nmissing. Most of the crowd is on the far side of the street, but our\nside is still well represented. Two local dogs are still hauling at\neach other.\n\nDirty Shirt Jones\u2019 head protrudes from the side of that big drum, and\nhis right arm is wedged straight up, making him look like a drowning\nman what is going down for the last time.\n\nMighty Jones has got one boot through the mechanical end of a big\nbrass horn, while from inside the other boot protrudes that banner,\nwith the proclamation missing.\n\nMagpie is lying near me, with both feet through Wick Smith\u2019s picket\nfence, and he\u2019s still studying that little note-book.\n\n\u201cWas that last one Lucy or Hannibal?\u201d he asks, slow and deliberate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2014it don\u2019t make no matter,\u201d says a weak voice, \u201cthey\u2019re all gone\npast anyway,\u201d and the man who got his hat punctured in the newspaper\noffice rises up from behind the fence, and tugs at the brim of his\nhat, which is hanging around his neck.\n\nI goes out and helps to cut Dirty Shirt loose from the drum, when up\ncomes one of Holt\u2019s kids.\n\n\u201cMister,\u201d says he to the show feller, \u201cI seen a man tie them cans on\nyour dogs.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive the sheriff a description of him,\u201d says he, excited-like. \u201cI\noffers ten dollars reward for the conviction of the persons connected\nwith the dastardly outrage.\u201d\n\n\u201cCheap enough,\u201d agrees Magpie. \u201cDid he have a long mustache and long\nhair?\u201d\n\n\u201cNaw. He didn\u2019t have no hair on his face a-tall,\u201d replies the kid.\n\n\u201cMust a been an outside job,\u201d proclaims Magpie. \u201cAll the men in\nPiperock wear hair on their faces, except Slim Hawkins, and he wears\nink.\u201d\n\nMe and Magpie pilgrims home and uses up a bottle of hoss liniment.\n\n\u201cWhen yuh going to get that Tombstone person?\u201d I asks, after we\nfinishes our supper. \u201cThere ain\u2019t no sense in leaving a critter like\nhim loose, Magpie.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a ornery hombre all right, all right,\u201d agrees Magpie. \u201cHe ain\u2019t\nso dangerous as he is plumb mean, Ike. He\u2019s shot at me several times,\nbut as he ain\u2019t hit me yet I reckon he\u2019s trying to scare me. Must \u2019a\u2019\nbeen Cactus what painted Slim with the ink. Me and Slim are the same\nbuild.\n\n\u201cI sure wish that Tombstone could live long enough to read his\nobituary, Ike. She\u2019s a bird. I sure dug deep into my soul for that\nstuff, and I surprises myself with what I writes. Them two is sore\nover the election. They opined to be deputies under Anderson.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat paper must \u2019a\u2019 printed some truths about folks,\u201d I opines, and\nMagpie grins:\n\n\u201cYou said something, Ike. He sure did ride folks. Yuh ought to see\nwhat he said about Paradise folks. I reckon they\u2019re just about\nstarting to boil over down there.\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you print yours right soon, Magpie?\u201d I asks. \u201cSeems to me that\nit\u2019s a weekly.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh\u2014comes out on Friday. Yuh see I had to change that day right\noff the reel, \u2019cause if I had any hangings to attend to it would\ninterfere with the paper. I looks into the future, Ike.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says I, \u201cit don\u2019t make much difference now, being as the ink\nis all gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so. I wish you\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 stayed there and \u2019tended to business,\nIke.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd got all inked up, eh? I never did have any luck, and if it had\n\u2019a\u2019 been me somebody would \u2019a\u2019 come in and helped Cactus find that\npaste jar. Too bad the show got busted up thataway.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d yawns Magpie. \u201cWe ain\u2019t had a good show for a long time, but\nI don\u2019t admire a show what depends on three dogs and eight cakes of\nice. Let\u2019s hit the hay.\u201d\n\nThat night somebody comes down and paints a skull and cross bones on\nour door, and it makes Magpie sore.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m commencing to get riled internally, Ike,\u201d he states, when he\nviews said works of art. \u201cYou go back and hold down the newspaper, and\nin a little while I\u2019ll show yuh the scalp of this artist. Rustle\naround and see if there\u2019s any ink left.\n\n\u201cI got that obituary all fixed up left-handed, and she\u2019s cached under\na soap-box behind the printing machine. Don\u2019t jiggle it \u2019cause she\u2019s\nfragile as \u2014\u2014! I left that page just like she was for the other paper,\nbut I got a place in it what fits this here masterpiece of mine. If\nTombstone should make a mistake and hit me yuh won\u2019t need the\nobituary. Sabe?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh, I\u2019ll just run the rest, Magpie. It looks like a bundle o\u2019\ncrape anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Ike,\u201d he reminds me, as I buckles on my gun, \u201cyuh take that type\nstuff and put it inside the press. Sabe? Then yuh take that roller\nthing and pour on some ink, roll her over the letters, slap on a sheet\nof paper and twist that handle down hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou furnish the news, Magpie,\u201d says I. \u201cI\u2019ll hold the wheels of\nprogress for Tombstone Todd.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nI goes up to Buck\u2019s place, and settles some elixir under my belt,\nwhile me and Buck talks over the humdrum existence we\u2019re leading.\n\n\u201cDirty Shirt is still going around with his right hand up in the air,\u201d\nlaughs Buck. \u201cReckon he\u2019s flagged every one in sight.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s the show outfit?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cRight miserable, I reckon. All of \u2019em except one left on the stage\nthis morning. That exception\u2014a colored person\u2014mistakes Slim for a\nblood-brother, and being as Slim ain\u2019t back yet, I\u2019d say they went\nquite a ways. I never seen fast black fade the way that person did.\n\n\u201cThat other colored member didn\u2019t have much to say this morning. He\nwas packing one of them slide horns in the band last night, and when\nthe buckboard hit him he sails right into Pete Gonyer. Him and Pete\nholds about even until Pete gets his hands loose, and then he winds\nthat horn around the feller\u2019s neck so many times that we has to lay\nthat colored gent across an anvil and cut it loose with a\ncold-chisel.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeen anything of Tombstone Todd or Cactus Collins?\u201d I asks, but Buck\nsays:\n\n\u201cNope. Somebody ought to puncture that pair of Jaspers, Ike. I figure\nthere\u2019s only one critter what is meaner than Tombstone Todd, and\nthere\u2019s a bounty on his hide. I ain\u2019t been drunk for six years, Ike,\nbut when Tombstone Todd stops enough lead to make him a spirit I\u2019m\ngoing to celebrate. When does Magpie aim to exterminate said human\ncoyote?\u201d\n\n\u201cMagpie suffers from softening of the heart,\u201d says I \u201cbut him or\nTombstone is due to hunt the hereafter right soon.\u201d\n\nI leaves there, and pilgrims down to the newspaper office, but I don\u2019t\nwalk right inside. Not me. The Harper tribe ain\u2019t skittish of trouble,\nand my nose ain\u2019t a stranger to powder smoke, but I\u2019m cautious.\n\nI Injuns up to the back window, flattens my carcass against the wall\nand peers inside. I ain\u2019t taking no chances. Sabe? It\u2019s a little too\nearly to open up, and the sunshine is nice and warm. Everything is\npeaceful-looking around Piperock, so I sets down there on a box\nagainst the wall, and communes thusly:\n\n\u201cIke Harper, you sure do live in the best little town on earth.\nPeaceful and quiet\u2014no hurry or worry. Plenty of time to live and no\nquestions asked. What if I am a editor? It sure is worth while to live\nsimply and quietly in a community where brotherly love is the motto\nand where peace doves nest and suckle their young.\u201d\n\nSudden-like I hears the dull rattle of many hoofs, and down the street\ncomes a lot of men on hosses. They completes a picture of a peaceful\nWestern village. There ain\u2019t no boisterous or unseemly language as\nthey ambles along through the dust\u2014just the jingle of bit-chains and\nthe squeak of saddles.\n\nThey don\u2019t look like they was going far, \u2019cause they don\u2019t seem to\nhave no baggage. One of \u2019em is carrying a big bucket, and another\nseems to have a bundle in his arms.\n\nThey swings down towards me, but I merely yawns. They stops in front\nof my office, and dismounts. I reckon it\u2019s my chore to go out and get\n\u2019em to subscribe, but I don\u2019t do it. I got enough subscriptions. They\nmust \u2019a\u2019 thought the only way to get into a newspaper office was by\nmain force, so they picks up a piece of lodge-pole, and knocks the\ndoor down.\n\nComes one shot\u2014no more. Out of curiosity, more than anything else, I\nsort of leans forward on my box and takes note of what I can see. Out\nin front the crowd sort of surrounds somebody, what ain\u2019t got no\nclothes on. I don\u2019t hear much conversation what ain\u2019t profane, and\npretty soon I sees some feathers drift away on the breeze. Two broncs\nare linked together with that pole, a bundle what looks like a mighty\nbuzzard is straddled the pole, and they all moves away as quietly as\nthey came.\n\nI watches \u2019em go away, and then I yawns some more and enters the\nsacred precincts of _The Piperock Pilot_. I hunts all over the place\nuntil I finds a can with a little ink left in it. I looks under the\nsoap-box and finds that obituary. After considerable trouble I\ndeciphers same, and this is it:\n\n                         EPITAPH ON TOMBSTONE\n\n         He was a bad man from Willer Crick.\n         His bluff was good but it didn\u2019t stick.\n         He shot at the sheriff till the sheriff got sore,\n         Now his boots leave tracks on that beautiful shore.\n\nI wipes the tears off my cheeks when I reads it. Magpie said he had\nput his soul into it, but I never knowed before how deep Magpie\u2019s soul\nreally was. It\u2019s a hy-iu composition, but I got a better idea. I takes\nit over to where them lead letters repose, and reconstructs the thing\na bit.\n\nI ain\u2019t no poet, but in a time like this a man\u2019s spirit guides his\nfingers. I works for an hour, trying to make the blamed things stand\nup long enough to be read backwards, and I\u2019m sore enough to kick a\nbaby when Magpie shows up. He looks at me and grins, when he sees what\nI\u2019m doing, and rolls a smoke.\n\n\u201cOne of \u2019em has left, Ike,\u201d he states. \u201cHank Padden rode in a while\nago, and said he met Cactus Collins on his way to Willer Crick. I\u2019ll\nget Tombstone before night. Sabe?\u201d\n\n\u201cThem is noble resolutions, Magpie. You know how to make this stuff\nstand up while she leaves her message on paper?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure. What yuh want to print it for, Ike? We ain\u2019t got no paper to\nwaste.\u201d\n\n\u201cMagpie,\u201d says I, \u201ca editor likes to see his stuff printed. I got a\nold piece of paper what will do for this.\u201d\n\nMagpie sets the stuff in a little oblong affair, rolls on some ink,\nlays on the piece of paper, and twists down the handle. This is how\nshe looks:\n\n                           TAR ON TOMBSTONE\n\n              He was a bad man from Willer Crick.\n              On his birthday suit grows feathers thick.\n              Feathers and tar instead of a grave,\n              Mistook for an editor \u2019cause of a shave.\n\nMagpie reads it all through. He sets down on a box, rolls a smoke, and\nreads it some more. He walks out to the door, looks around, and comes\nback.\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d he asks.\n\n\u201cParadise folks, Magpie.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you see him in here?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh. He was laying for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cPshaw!\u201d\n\nMagpie takes his gun out and looks it over, sad-like. He stares at the\ndoor for a minute, and then\u2014\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the notice on the door?\u201d\n\nHe walks over and looks. Somebody has printed a notice and pinned it\non that busted door, and she reads like this\u2014\n\n                    THIS PAPER HAS QUIT FOR KEEPS\n\nI went back and got that can of ink, and a stick, and I signs it\u2014\n\n                            TOMBSTONE TODD\n\n\u201cWhat for, Ike?\u201d asks Magpie. \u201cWhat did he have to do with it?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome back here, and I\u2019ll show yuh.\u201d\n\nI takes him back to the table, and shows him a line of lead letters\nsetting there on the table. It\u2019s the biggest in sight, and they reads:\n\n                   EPITAF FOR MAGPY SIMPKIN. BRAVE\n                   MEN AND DARN FULES DON\u2019T SKARE.\n                   HE WAS A DARN FULE MAY HE\n                   REST IN PIECE\n\nWe walks almost to the door, when Magpie goes back and gets that stick\nand the can of ink.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give him all the credit coming to him, Ike,\u201d says he, and\nunderneath Tombstone\u2019s name he prints\u2014\n\n                          EDITOR PRO TEMPORE",
