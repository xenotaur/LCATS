School is\nall right up to a certain p'int, but arter that comes the sea.  I've been\nthere myself and I know wot I'm talking about.  All that I am I owe to\n'aving been to sea.\n\nThere's a saying that boys will be boys.  That's all right till they go\nto sea, and then they 'ave to be men, and good men too.  They get knocked\nabout a bit, o' course, but that's all part o' the eddication, and when\nthey get bigger they pass the eddication they've received on to other\nboys smaller than wot they are.  Arter I'd been at sea a year I spent all\nmy fust time ashore going round and looking for boys wot 'ad knocked me\nabout afore I sailed, and there was only one out o' the whole lot that I\nwished I 'adn't found.\n\nMost people, o' course, go to sea as boys or else not at all, but I mind\none chap as was pretty near thirty years old when 'e started.  It's a\ngood many years ago now, and he was landlord of a public-'ouse as used to\nstand in Wapping, called the Blue Lion.\n\nHis mother, wot had 'ad the pub afore 'im, 'ad brought 'im up very quiet\nand genteel, and when she died 'e went and married a fine, handsome young\nwoman who 'ad got her eye on the pub without thinking much about 'im.  I\ngot to know about it through knowing the servant that lived there.  A\nnice, quiet gal she was, and there wasn't much went on that she didn't\nhear.  I've known 'er to cry for hours with the ear-ache, pore gal.\n\nNot caring much for 'er 'usband, and being spoiled by 'im into the\nbargain, Mrs. Dixon soon began to lead 'im a terrible life.  She was\nalways throwing his meekness and mildness up into 'is face, and arter\nthey 'ad been married two or three years he was no more like the landlord\no' that public-'ouse than I'm like a lord.  Not so much.  She used to get\ninto such terrible tempers there was no doing anything with 'er, and for\nthe sake o' peace and quietness he gave way to 'er till 'e got into the\nhabit of it and couldn't break 'imself of it.\n\nThey 'adn't been married long afore she 'ad her cousin, Charlie Burge,\ncome in as barman, and a month or two arter that 'is brother Bob, who 'ad\nbeen spending a lot o' time looking for work instead o' doing it, came\ntoo.  They was so comfortable there that their father--a 'ouse-painter by\ntrade--came round to see whether he couldn't paint the Blue Lion up a bit\nand make 'em look smart, so that they'd get more trade.  He was one o'\nthese 'ere fust-class 'ousepainters that can go to sleep on a ladder\nholding a brush in one hand and a pot o' paint in the other, and by the\ntime he 'ad finished painting the 'ouse it was ready to be done all over\nagin.\n\nI dare say that George Dixon--that was 'is name--wouldn't ha' minded so\nmuch if 'is wife 'ad only been civil, but instead o' that she used to\nmake fun of 'im and order 'im about, and by-and-by the others began to\ntry the same thing.  As I said afore, Dixon was a very quiet man, and if\nthere was ever anybody to be put outside Charlie or Bob used to do it.\nThey tried to put me outside once, the two of 'em, but they on'y did it\nat last by telling me that somebody 'ad gone off and left a pot o' beer\nstanding on the pavement.  They was both of 'em fairly strong young chaps\nwith a lot of bounce in 'em, and she used to say to her 'usband wot fine\nyoung fellers they was, and wot a pity it was he wasn't like 'em.\n\nTalk like this used to upset George Dixon awful.  Having been brought up\ncareful by 'is mother, and keeping a very quiet, respectable 'ouse--I\nused it myself--he cert'nly was soft, and I remember 'im telling me once\nthat he didn't believe in fighting, and that instead of hitting people\nyou ought to try and persuade them.  He was uncommon fond of 'is wife,\nbut at last one day, arter she 'ad made a laughing-stock of 'im in the\nbar, he up and spoke sharp to her.\n\n\"Wot?\" ses Mrs. Dixon, 'ardly able to believe her ears.\n\n\"Remember who you're speaking to; that's wot I said,\" ses Dixon.\n\n\"'Ow dare you talk to me like that?\"  screams 'is wife, turning red with\nrage.  \"Wot d'ye mean by it?\"\n\n\"Because you seem to forget who is master 'ere,\" ses Dixon, in a\ntrembling voice.\n\n\"Master?\" she ses, firing up.  \"I'll soon show you who's master.  Go out\no' my bar; I won't 'ave you in it.  D'ye 'ear?  Go out of it.\"\n\nDixon turned away and began to serve a customer.  \"D'ye hear wot I say?\"\nses Mrs. Dixon, stamping 'er foot.  \"Go out o' my bar.  Here, Charlie!\"\n\n\"Hullo!\" ses 'er cousin, who 'ad been standing looking on and grinning.\n\n\"Take the master and put 'im into the parlour,\" ses Mrs. Dixon, \"and\ndon't let 'im come out till he's begged my pardon.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" ses Charlie, brushing up 'is shirt-sleeves; \"in you go.  You\n'ear wot she said.\"\n\nHe caught 'old of George Dixon, who 'ad just turned to the back o' the\nbar to give a customer change out of 'arf a crown, and ran 'im kicking\nand struggling into the parlour.  George gave 'im a silly little punch in\nthe chest, and got such a bang on the 'ead back that at fust he thought\nit was knocked off.\n\nWhen 'e came to 'is senses agin the door leading to the bar was shut, and\n'is wife's uncle, who 'ad been asleep in the easy-chair, was finding\nfault with 'im for waking 'im up.\n\n\"Why can't you be quiet and peaceable?\"  he ses, shaking his 'ead at him.\n\"I've been 'ard at work all the morning thinking wot colour to paint the\nback-door, and this is the second time I've been woke up since dinner.\nYou're old enough to know better.\"\n\n\"Go and sleep somewhere else, then,\" ses Dixon.  \"I don't want you 'ere\nat all, or your boys neither.  Go and give somebody else a treat; I've\n'ad enough of the whole pack of you.\"\n\nHe sat down and put 'is feet in the fender, and old Burge, as soon as he\n'ad got 'is senses back, went into the bar and complained to 'is niece,\nand she came into the parlour like a thunderstorm.\n\n\"You'll beg my uncle's pardon as well as mine afore you come out o' that\nroom,\" she said to her 'usband; \"mind that.\"\n\nGeorge Dixon didn't say a word; the shame of it was a'most more than 'e\ncould stand.  Then 'e got up to go out o' the parlour and Charlie pushed\n'im back agin.  Three times he tried, and then 'e stood up and looked at\n'is wife.\n\n\"I've been a good 'usband to you,\" he ses; \"but there's no satisfying\nyou.  You ought to ha' married somebody that would ha' knocked you about,\nand then you'd ha' been happy.  I'm too fond of a quiet life to suit\nyou.\"\n\n\"Are you going to beg my pardon and my uncle's pardon?\" ses 'is wife,\nstamping 'er foot.\n\n\"No,\" ses Dixon; \"I am not.  I'm surprised at you asking it.\"\n\n\"Well, you don't come out o' this room till you do,\" ses 'is wife.\n\n\"That won't hurt me,\" ses Dixon.  \"I couldn't look anybody in the face\narter being pushed out o' my own bar.\"\n\nThey kept 'im there all the rest o' the day, and, as 'e was still\nobstinate when bedtime came, Mrs. Dixon, who wasn't to be beat, brought\ndown some bedclothes and 'ad a bed made up for 'im on the sofa.  Some men\nwould ha' 'ad the police in for less than that, but George Dixon 'ad got\na great deal o' pride and 'e couldn't bear the shame of it.  Instead o'\nthat 'e acted like a fourteen-year-old boy and ran away to sea.\n\nThey found 'im gone when they came down in the morning, and the side-door\non the latch.  He 'ad left a letter for 'is wife on the table, telling\n'er wot he 'ad done.  Short and sweet it was, and wound up with telling\n'er to be careful that her uncle and cousins didn't eat 'er out of house\nand 'ome.\n\nShe got another letter two days arterward, saying that he 'ad shipped as\nordinary seaman on an American barque called the _Seabird,_ bound for\nCalifornia, and that 'e expected to be away a year, or thereabouts.\n\n\"It'll do 'im good,\" ses old Burge, when Mrs. Dixon read the letter to\n'em.  \"It's a 'ard life is the sea, and he'll appreciate his 'ome when 'e\ncomes back to it agin.  He don't know when 'e's well off.  It's as\ncomfortable a 'ome as a man could wish to 'ave.\"  It was surprising wot a\nlittle difference George Dixon's being away made to the Blue Lion.\nNobody seemed to miss 'im much, and things went on just the same as afore\nhe went.  Mrs. Dixon was all right with most people, and 'er relations\n'ad a very good time of it; old Burge began to put on flesh at such a\nrate that the sight of a ladder made 'im ill a'most, and Charlie and Bob\nwent about as if the place belonged to 'em.\n\nThey 'eard nothing for eight months, and then a letter came for Mrs.\nDixon from her 'usband in which he said that 'e had left the _Seabird_\nafter 'aving had a time which made 'im shiver to think of.  He said that\nthe men was the roughest of the rough and the officers was worse, and\nthat he 'ad hardly 'ad a day without a blow from one or the other since\nhe'd been aboard.  He'd been knocked down with a hand-spike by the second\nmate, and had 'ad a week in his bunk with a kick given 'im by the\nboatswain.  He said 'e was now on the _Rochester Castle,_ bound for\nSydney, and he 'oped for better times.\n\nThat was all they 'eard for some months, and then they got another letter\nsaying that the men on the _Rochester Castle_ was, if anything, worse\nthan those on the Seabird, and that he'd begun to think that running away\nto sea was diff'rent to wot he'd expected, and that he supposed 'e'd done\nit too late in life.  He sent 'is love to 'is wife and asked 'er as a\nfavour to send Uncle Burge and 'is boys away, as 'e didn't want to find\nthem there when 'e came home, because they was the cause of all his\nsufferings.\n\n\"He don't know 'is best friends,\" ses old Burge.  \"'E's got a nasty\nsperrit I don't like to see.\"\n\n\"I'll 'ave a word with 'im when 'e does come home,\" ses Bob.  \"I s'pose\nhe thinks 'imself safe writing letters thousands o' miles away.\"\n\nThe last letter they 'ad came from Auckland, and said that he 'ad shipped\non the _Monarch,_ bound for the Albert Docks, and he 'oped soon to be at\n'ome and managing the Blue Lion, same as in the old happy days afore he\nwas fool enough to go to sea.\n\nThat was the very last letter, and some time arterward the _Monarch_ was\nin the missing list, and by-and-by it became known that she 'ad gone down\nwith all hands not long arter leaving New Zealand.  The only difference\nit made at the Blue Lion was that Mrs. Dixon 'ad two of 'er dresses dyed\nblack, and the others wore black neckties for a fortnight and spoke of\nDixon as pore George, and said it was a funny world, but they supposed\neverything was for the best.\n\nIt must ha' been pretty near four years since George Dixon 'ad run off to\nsea when Charlie, who was sitting in the bar one arternoon reading the\npaper, things being dull, saw a man's head peep through the door for a\nminute and then disappear.  A'most direckly arterward it looked in at\nanother door and then disappeared agin.  When it looked in at the third\ndoor Charlie 'ad put down 'is paper and was ready for it.\n\n\"Who are you looking for?\" he ses, rather sharp.  \"Wot d'ye want?  Are\nyou 'aving a game of peepbo, or wot?\"\n\nThe man coughed and smiled, and then 'e pushed the door open gently and\ncame in, and stood there fingering 'is beard as though 'e didn't know wot\nto say.\n\n\"I've come back, Charlie,\" he ses at last.\n\n\"Wot, George!\"  ses Charlie, starting.  \"Why, I didn't know you in that\nbeard.  We all thought you was dead, years ago.\"\n\n\"I was pretty nearly, Charlie,\" ses Dixon, shaking his 'ead.  \"Ah! I've\n'ad a terrible time since I left 'once.\"\n\n\"'You don't seem to ha' made your fortune,\" ses Charlie, looking down at\n'is clothes.  \"I'd ha' been ashamed to come 'ome like that if it 'ad been\nme.\"\n\n\"I'm wore out,\" ses Dixon, leaning agin the bar.  \"I've got no pride\nleft; it's all been knocked out of me.  How's Julia?\"\n\n\"She's all right,\" ses Charlie.  \"Here, Ju--\"\n\n\"H'sh!\" ses Dixon, reaching over the bar and laying his 'and on his arm.\n\"Don't let 'er know too sudden; break it to 'er gently.\"\n\n\"Fiddlesticks!\"  ses Charlie, throwing his 'and off and calling, \"Here,\nJulia!  He's come back.\"\n\nMrs. Dixon came running downstairs and into the bar.  \"Good gracious!\"\nshe ses, staring at her 'us-band.  \"Whoever'd ha' thought o' seeing you\nagin?  Where 'ave you sprung from?\"\n\n\"Ain't you glad to see me, Julia?\"  ses George Dixon.\n\n\"Yes, I s'pose so; if you've come back to behave yourself,\" ses Mrs.\nDixon.  \"What 'ave you got to say for yourself for running away and then\nwriting them letters, telling me to get rid of my relations?\"\n\n\"That's a long time ago, Julia,\" ses Dixon, raising the flap in the\ncounter and going into the bar.  \"I've gone through a great deal o'\nsuffering since then.  I've been knocked about till I 'adn't got any\nfeeling left in me; I've been shipwrecked, and I've 'ad to fight for my\nlife with savages.\"\n\n\"Nobody asked you to run away,\" ses his wife, edging away as he went to\nput his arm round 'er waist.  \"You'd better go upstairs and put on some\ndecent clothes.\"\n\nDixon looked at 'er for a moment and then he 'ung his 'ead.\n\n\"I've been thinking o' you and of seeing you agin every day since I went\naway, Julia,\" he ses.  \"You'd be the same to me if you was dressed in\nrags.\"\n\nHe went upstairs without another word, and old Burge, who was coming\ndown, came down five of 'em at once owing to Dixon speaking to 'im afore\nhe knew who 'e was.  The old man was still grumbling when Dixon came down\nagin, and said he believed he'd done it a-purpose.\n\n\"You run away from a good 'ome,\" he ses, \"and the best wife in Wapping,\nand you come back and frighten people 'arf out o' their lives.  I never\nsee such a feller in all my born days.\"\n\n\"I was so glad to get 'ome agin I didn't think,\" ses Dixon.  \"I hope\nyou're not 'urt.\"\n\nHe started telling them all about his 'ardships while they were at tea,\nbut none of 'em seemed to care much about hearing 'em.  Bob said that the\nsea was all right for men, and that other people were sure not to like\nit.\n\n\"And you brought it all on yourself,\" ses Charlie.  \"You've only got\nyourself to thank for it.  I 'ad thought o' picking a bone with you over\nthose letters you wrote.\"\n\n\"Let's 'ope 'e's come back more sensible than wot 'e was when 'e went\naway,\" ses old Burge, with 'is mouth full o' toast.\n\nBy the time he'd been back a couple o' days George Dixon could see that\n'is going away 'adn't done any good at all.  Nobody seemed to take any\nnotice of 'im or wot he said, and at last, arter a word or two with\nCharlie about the rough way he spoke to some o' the customers, Charlie\ncame in to Mrs. Dixon and said that he was at 'is old tricks of\ninterfering, and he would not 'ave it.\n\n\"Well, he'd better keep out o' the bar altogether,\" ses Mrs. Dixon.\n\"There's no need for 'im to go there; we managed all right while 'e was\naway.\"\n\n\"Do you mean I'm not to go into my own bar?\" ses Dixon, stammering.\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" ses Mrs. Dixon.  \"You kept out of it for four years to\nplease yourself, and now you can keep out of it to please me.\"\n\n\"I've put you out o' the bar before,\" ses Charlie, \"and if you come\nmessing about with me any more I'll do it agin.  So now you know.\"\n\nHe walked back into the bar whistling, and George Dixon, arter sitting\nstill for a long time thinking, got up and went into the bar, and he'd\n'ardly got his foot inside afore Charlie caught 'old of 'im by the\nshoulder and shoved 'im back into the parlour agin.\n\n\"I told you wot it would be,\" ses Mrs. Dixon, looking up from 'er sewing.\n\"You've only got your interfering ways to thank for it.\"\n\n\"This is a fine state of affairs in my own 'ouse,\" ses Dixon, 'ardly able\nto speak.  \"You've got no proper feeling for your husband, Julia, else\nyou wouldn't allow it.  Why, I was happier at sea than wot I am 'ere.\"\n\n\"Well, you'd better go back to it if you're so fond of it,\" ses 'is wife.\n\n\"I think I 'ad,\" ses Dixon.  \"If I can't be master in my own 'ouse I'm\nbetter at sea, hard as it is.  You must choose between us, Julia--me or\nyour relations.  I won't sleep under the same roof as them for another\nnight.  Am I to go?\"\n\n\"Please yourself,\" ses 'is wife.  \"I don't mind your staying 'ere so long\nas you behave yourself, but the others won't go; you can make your mind\neasy on that.\"\n\n\"I'll go and look for another ship, then,\" ses Dixon, taking up 'is cap.\n\"I'm not wanted here.  P'r'aps you wouldn't mind 'aving some clothes\npacked into a chest for me so as I can go away decent.\"\n\nHe looked round at 'is wife, as though 'e expected she'd ask 'im not to\ngo, but she took no notice, and he opened the door softly and went out,\nwhile old Burge, who 'ad come into the room and 'eard what he was saying,\ntrotted off upstairs to pack 'is chest for 'im.\n\nIn two hours 'e was back agin and more cheerful than he 'ad been since he\n'ad come 'ome.  Bob was in the bar and the others were just sitting down\nto tea, and a big chest, nicely corded, stood on the floor in the corner\nof the room.\n\n\"That's right,\" he ses, looking at it; \"that's just wot I wanted.\"\n\n\"It's as full as it can be,\" ses old Burge.  \"I done it for you myself.\n'Ave you got a ship?\"\n\n\"I 'ave,\" ses Dixon.  \"A jolly good ship.  No more hardships for me this\ntime.  I've got a berth as captain.\"\n\n\"Wot?\" ses 'is wife.  \"Captain?  You!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" ses Dixon, smiling at her.  \"You can sail with me if you like.\"\n\n\"Thankee,\" ses Mrs. Dixon, \"I'm quite comfortable where I am.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say you've got a master's berth?\" ses Charlie, staring at\n'im.\n\n\"I do,\" ses Dixon; \"master and owner.\"\n\nCharlie coughed.  \"Wot's the name of the ship?\"  he asks, winking at the\nothers.\n\n\"The BLUE LION,\" ses Dixon, in a voice that made 'em all start.  \"I'm\nshipping a new crew and I pay off the old one to-night.  You first, my\nlad.\"\n\n\"Pay off,\" ses Charlie, leaning back in 'is chair and staring at 'im in a\npuzzled way.  \"Blue Lion?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" ses Dixon, in the same loud voice.  \"When I came 'ome the other\nday I thought p'r'aps I'd let bygones be bygones, and I laid low for a\nbit to see whether any of you deserved it.  I went to sea to get\nhardened--and I got hard.  I've fought men that would eat you at a meal.\nI've 'ad more blows in a week than you've 'ad in a lifetime, you\nfat-faced land-lubber.\"\n\nHe walked to the door leading to the bar, where Bob was doing 'is best to\nserve customers and listen at the same time, and arter locking it put the\nkey in 'is pocket.  Then 'e put his 'and in 'is pocket and slapped some\nmoney down on the table in front o' Charlie.\n\n\"There's a month's pay instead o' notice,\" he ses.  \"Now git.\"\n\n\"George!\" screams 'is wife.  \"'Ow dare you?  'Ave you gone crazy?\"\n\n\"I'm surprised at you,\" ses old Burge, who'd been looking on with 'is\nmouth wide open, and pinching 'imself to see whether 'e wasn't dreaming.\n\n\"I don't go for your orders,\" ses Charlie, getting up.  \"Wot d'ye mean by\nlocking that door?\"\n\n\"Wot!\" roars Dixon.  \"Hang it!  I mustn't lock a door without asking my\nbarman now.  Pack up and be off, you swab, afore I start on you.\"\n\nCharlie gave a growl and rushed at 'im, and the next moment 'e was down\non the floor with the 'ardest bang in the face that he'd ever 'ad in 'is\nlife.  Mrs. Dixon screamed and ran into the kitchen, follered by old\nBurge, who went in to tell 'er not to be frightened.  Charlie got up and\nwent for Dixon agin; but he 'ad come back as 'ard as nails and 'ad a\nrushing style o' fighting that took Charlie's breath away.  By the time\nBob 'ad left the bar to take care of itself, and run round and got in the\nback way, Charlie had 'ad as much as 'e wanted and was lying on the\nsea-chest in the corner trying to get 'is breath.\n\n\"Yes?  Wot d'ye want?\"  ses Dixon, with a growl, as Bob came in at the\ndoor.\n\nHe was such a 'orrible figure, with the blood on 'is face and 'is beard\nsticking out all ways, that Bob, instead of doing wot he 'ad come round\nfor, stood in the doorway staring at 'im without a word.\n\n\"I'm paying off,\" ses Dixon.  \"'Ave you got any-thing to say agin it?\"\n\n\"No,\" ses Bob, drawing back.\n\n\"You and Charlie'll go now,\" ses Dixon, taking out some money.  \"The old\nman can stay on for a month to give 'im time to look round.  Don't look\nat me that way, else I'll knock your 'ead off.\"\n\nHe started counting out Bob's money just as old Burge and Mrs. Dixon,\nhearing all quiet, came in out of the kitchen.\n\n\"Don't you be alarmed on my account, my dear,\" he ses, turning to 'is\nwife; \"it's child's play to wot I've been used to.  I'll just see these\ntwo mistaken young fellers off the premises, and then we'll 'ave a cup o'\ntea while the old man minds the bar.\"\n\nMrs. Dixon tried to speak, but 'er temper was too much for 'er.  She\nlooked from her 'usband to Charlie and Bob and then back at 'im agin and\ncaught 'er breath.\n\n\"That's right,\" ses Dixon, nodding his 'ead at her.  \"I'm master and\nowner of the Blue Lion and you're first mate.  When I'm speaking you keep\nquiet; that's dissipline.\"\n\n\nI was in that bar about three months arterward, and I never saw such\na change in any woman as there was in Mrs. Dixon.  Of all the\nnice-mannered, soft-spoken landladies I've ever seen, she was the best,\nand on'y to 'ear the way she answered her 'usband when he spoke to 'er\nwas a pleasure to every married man in the bar.",
