    "body": "By Joseph Conrad\n\n\nWhat was known of Captain Hagberd in the little seaport of Colebrook was\nnot exactly in his favour. He did not belong to the place. He had come\nto settle there under circumstances not at all mysterious--he used to\nbe very communicative about them at the time--but extremely morbid and\nunreasonable. He was possessed of some little money evidently, because\nhe bought a plot of ground, and had a pair of ugly yellow brick cottages\nrun up very cheaply. He occupied one of them himself and let the other\nto Josiah Carvil--blind Carvil, the retired boat-builder--a man of evil\nrepute as a domestic tyrant.\n\nThese cottages had one wall in common, shared in a line of iron railing\ndividing their front gardens; a wooden fence separated their back\ngardens. Miss Bessie Carvil was allowed, as it were of right, to throw\nover it the tea-cloths, blue rags, or an apron that wanted drying.\n\n\u201cIt rots the wood, Bessie my girl,\u201d the captain would remark mildly,\nfrom his side of the fence, each time he saw her exercising that\nprivilege.\n\nShe was a tall girl; the fence was low, and she could spread her elbows\non the top. Her hands would be red with the bit of washing she had\ndone, but her forearms were white and shapely, and she would look at her\nfather\u2019s landlord in silence--in an informed silence which had an air of\nknowledge, expectation and desire.\n\n\u201cIt rots the wood,\u201d repeated Captain Hagberd. \u201cIt is the only unthrifty,\ncareless habit I know in you. Why don\u2019t you have a clothes line out in\nyour back yard?\u201d\n\nMiss Carvil would say nothing to this--she only shook her head\nnegatively. The tiny back yard on her side had a few stone-bordered\nlittle beds of black earth, in which the simple flowers she found time\nto cultivate appeared somehow extravagantly overgrown, as if belonging\nto an exotic clime; and Captain Hagberd\u2019s upright, hale person, clad in\nNo. 1 sail-cloth from head to foot, would be emerging knee-deep out of\nrank grass and the tall weeks on his side of the fence. He appeared,\nwith the colour and uncouth stiffness of the extraordinary material in\nwhich he chose to clothe himself--\u201cfor the time being,\u201d would be his\nmumbled remark to any observation on the subject--like a man roughened\nout of granite, standing in a wilderness not big enough for a decent\nbilliard-room. A heavy figure of a man of stone, with a red handsome\nface, a blue wandering eye, and a great white beard flowing to his waist\nand never trimmed as far as Colebrook knew.\n\nSeven years before, he had seriously answered, \u201cNext month, I think,\u201d\n to the chaffing attempt to secure his custom made by that distinguished\nlocal wit, the Colebrook barber, who happened to be sitting insolently\nin the tap-room of the New Inn near the harbour, where the captain had\nentered to buy an ounce of tobacco. After paying for his purchase with\nthree half-pence extracted from the corner of a handkerchief which he\ncarried in the cuff of his sleeve, Captain Hagberd went out. As soon\nas the door was shut the barber laughed. \u201cThe old one and the young one\nwill be strolling arm in arm to get shaved in my place presently. The\ntailor shall be set to work, and the barber, and the candlestick maker;\nhigh old times are coming for Colebrook, they are coming, to be sure. It\nused to be \u2018next week,\u2019 now it has come to \u2018next month,\u2019 and so on--soon\nit will be next spring, for all I know.\u201d\n\nNoticing a stranger listening to him with a vacant grin, he explained,\nstretching out his legs cynically, that this queer old Hagberd, a\nretired coasting-skipper, was waiting for the return of a son of his.\nThe boy had been driven away from home, he shouldn\u2019t wonder; had run\naway to sea and had never been heard of since. Put to rest in Davy\nJones\u2019s locker this many a day, as likely as not. That old man came\nflying to Colebrook three years ago all in black broadcloth (had lost\nhis wife lately then), getting out of a third-class smoker as if the\ndevil had been at his heels; and the only thing that brought him down\nwas a letter--a hoax probably. Some joker had written to him about a\nseafaring man with some such name who was supposed to be hanging about\nsome girl or other, either in Colebrook or in the neighbourhood. \u201cFunny,\nain\u2019t it?\u201d The old chap had been advertising in the London papers for\nHarry Hagberd, and offering rewards for any sort of likely information.\nAnd the barber would go on to describe with sardonic gusto, how that\nstranger in mourning had been seen exploring the country, in carts, on\nfoot, taking everybody into his confidence, visiting all the inns\nand alehouses for miles around, stopping people on the road with his\nquestions, looking into the very ditches almost; first in the greatest\nexcitement, then with a plodding sort of perseverance, growing slower\nand slower; and he could not even tell you plainly how his son looked.\nThe sailor was supposed to be one of two that had left a timber\nship, and to have been seen dangling after some girl; but the old man\ndescribed a boy of fourteen or so--\u201ca clever-looking, high-spirited\nboy.\u201d And when people only smiled at this he would rub his forehead in\na confused sort of way before he slunk off, looking offended. He found\nnobody, of course; not a trace of anybody--never heard of anything worth\nbelief, at any rate; but he had not been able somehow to tear himself\naway from Colebrook.\n\n\u201cIt was the shock of this disappointment, perhaps, coming soon after the\nloss of his wife, that had driven him crazy on that point,\u201d the barber\nsuggested, with an air of great psychological insight. After a time the\nold man abandoned the active search. His son had evidently gone away;\nbut he settled himself to wait. His son had been once at least in\nColebrook in preference to his native place. There must have been some\nreason for it, he seemed to think, some very powerful inducement, that\nwould bring him back to Colebrook again.\n\n\u201cHa, ha, ha! Why, of course, Colebrook. Where else? That\u2019s the only\nplace in the United Kingdom for your long-lost sons. So he sold up his\nold home in Colchester, and down he comes here. Well, it\u2019s a craze,\nlike any other. Wouldn\u2019t catch me going crazy over any of my youngsters\nclearing out. I\u2019ve got eight of them at home.\u201d The barber was showing\noff his strength of mind in the midst of a laughter that shook the\ntap-room.\n\nStrange, though, that sort of thing, he would confess, with the\nfrankness of a superior intelligence, seemed to be catching. His\nestablishment, for instance, was near the harbour, and whenever a\nsailor-man came in for a hair-cut or a shave--if it was a strange face he\ncouldn\u2019t help thinking directly, \u201cSuppose he\u2019s the son of old Hagberd!\u201d\n He laughed at himself for it. It was a strong craze. He could remember\nthe time when the whole town was full of it. But he had his hopes of the\nold chap yet. He would cure him by a course of judicious chaffing. He\nwas watching the progress of the treatment. Next week--next month--next\nyear! When the old skipper had put off the date of that return till next\nyear, he would be well on his way to not saying any more about it. In\nother matters he was quite rational, so this, too, was bound to come.\nSuch was the barber\u2019s firm opinion.\n\nNobody had ever contradicted him; his own hair had gone grey since\nthat time, and Captain Hagberd\u2019s beard had turned quite white, and had\nacquired a majestic flow over the No. 1 canvas suit, which he had made\nfor himself secretly with tarred twine, and had assumed suddenly, coming\nout in it one fine morning, whereas the evening before he had been seen\ngoing home in his mourning of broadcloth. It caused a sensation in the\nHigh Street--shopkeepers coming to their doors, people in the houses\nsnatching up their hats to run out--a stir at which he seemed strangely\nsurprised at first, and then scared; but his only answer to the\nwondering questions was that startled and evasive, \u201cFor the present.\u201d\n\nThat sensation had been forgotten, long ago; and Captain Hagberd\nhimself, if not forgotten, had come to be disregarded--the penalty of\ndailiness--as the sun itself is disregarded unless it makes its power\nfelt heavily. Captain Hagberd\u2019s movements showed no infirmity: he walked\nstiffly in his suit of canvas, a quaint and remarkable figure; only his\neyes wandered more furtively perhaps than of yore. His manner abroad had\nlost its excitable watchfulness; it had become puzzled and diffident,\nas though he had suspected that there was somewhere about him something\nslightly compromising, some embarrassing oddity; and yet had remained\nunable to discover what on earth this something wrong could be.\n\nHe was unwilling now to talk with the townsfolk. He had earned for\nhimself the reputation of an awful skinflint, of a miser in the matter\nof living. He mumbled regretfully in the shops, bought inferior scraps\nof meat after long hesitations; and discouraged all allusions to his\ncostume. It was as the barber had foretold. For all one could tell, he\nhad recovered already from the disease of hope; and only Miss Bessie\nCarvil knew that he said nothing about his son\u2019s return because with him\nit was no longer \u201cnext week,\u201d \u201cnext month,\u201d or even \u201cnext year.\u201d It was\n\u201cto-morrow.\u201d\n\nIn their intimacy of back yard and front garden he talked with her\npaternally, reasonably, and dogmatically, with a touch of arbitrariness.\nThey met on the ground of unreserved confidence, which was authenticated\nby an affectionate wink now and then. Miss Carvil had come to look\nforward rather to these winks. At first they had discomposed her: the\npoor fellow was mad. Afterwards she had learned to laugh at them: there\nwas no harm in him. Now she was aware of an unacknowledged, pleasurable,\nincredulous emotion, expressed by a faint blush. He winked not in the\nleast vulgarly; his thin red face with a well-modelled curved nose, had\na sort of distinction--the more so that when he talked to her he looked\nwith a steadier and more intelligent glance. A handsome, hale, upright,\ncapable man, with a white beard. You did not think of his age. His son,\nhe affirmed, had resembled him amazingly from his earliest babyhood.\n\nHarry would be one-and-thirty next July, he declared. Proper age to get\nmarried with a nice, sensible girl that could appreciate a good home. He\nwas a very high-spirited boy. High-spirited husbands were the easiest\nto manage. These mean, soft chaps, that you would think butter\nwouldn\u2019t melt in their mouths, were the ones to make a woman thoroughly\nmiserable. And there was nothing like a home--a fireside--a good roof:\nno turning out of your warm bed in all sorts of weather. \u201cEh, my dear?\u201d\n\nCaptain Hagberd had been one of those sailors that pursue their calling\nwithin sight of land. One of the many children of a bankrupt farmer, he\nhad been apprenticed hurriedly to a coasting skipper, and had remained\non the coast all his sea life. It must have been a hard one at first:\nhe had never taken to it; his affection turned to the land, with its\ninnumerable houses, with its quiet lives gathered round its firesides.\nMany sailors feel and profess a rational dislike for the sea, but his\nwas a profound and emotional animosity--as if the love of the stabler\nelement had been bred into him through many generations.\n\n\u201cPeople did not know what they let their boys in for when they let them\ngo to sea,\u201d he expounded to Bessie. \u201cAs soon make convicts of them at\nonce.\u201d He did not believe you ever got used to it. The weariness of such\na life got worse as you got older. What sort of trade was it in which\nmore than half your time you did not put your foot inside your house?\nDirectly you got out to sea you had no means of knowing what went on\nat home. One might have thought him weary of distant voyages; and the\nlongest he had ever made had lasted a fortnight, of which the most part\nhad been spent at anchor, sheltering from the weather. As soon as his\nwife had inherited a house and enough to live on (from a bachelor uncle\nwho had made some money in the coal business) he threw up his command of\nan East-coast collier with a feeling as though he had escaped from the\ngalleys. After all these years he might have counted on the fingers of\nhis two hands all the days he had been out of sight of England. He\nhad never known what it was to be out of soundings. \u201cI have never been\nfurther than eighty fathoms from the land,\u201d was one of his boasts.\n\nBessie Carvil heard all these things. In front of their cottage grew an\nunder-sized ash; and on summer afternoons she would bring out a chair\non the grass-plot and sit down with her sewing. Captain Hagberd, in his\ncanvas suit, leaned on a spade. He dug every day in his front plot. He\nturned it over and over several times every year, but was not going to\nplant anything \u201cjust at present.\u201d\n\nTo Bessie Carvil he would state more explicitly: \u201cNot till our Harry\ncomes home to-morrow.\u201d And she had heard this formula of hope so often\nthat it only awakened the vaguest pity in her heart for that hopeful old\nman.\n\nEverything was put off in that way, and everything was being prepared\nlikewise for to-morrow. There was a boxful of packets of various\nflower-seeds to choose from, for the front garden. \u201cHe will doubtless let\nyou have your say about that, my dear,\u201d Captain Hagberd intimated to her\nacross the railing.\n\nMiss Bessie\u2019s head remained bowed over her work. She had heard all this\nso many times. But now and then she would rise, lay down her sewing, and\ncome slowly to the fence. There was a charm in these gentle ravings. He\nwas determined that his son should not go away again for the want of a\nhome all ready for him. He had been filling the other cottage with all\nsorts of furniture. She imagined it all new, fresh with varnish, piled\nup as in a warehouse. There would be tables wrapped up in sacking; rolls\nof carpets thick and vertical like fragments of columns, the gleam of\nwhite marble tops in the dimness of the drawn blinds. Captain Hagberd\nalways described his purchases to her, carefully, as to a person having\na legitimate interest in them. The overgrown yard of his cottage could\nbe laid over with concrete... after to-morrow.\n\n\u201cWe may just as well do away with the fence. You could have your\ndrying-line out, quite clear of your flowers.\u201d He winked, and she would\nblush faintly.\n\nThis madness that had entered her life through the kind impulses of her\nheart had reasonable details. What if some day his son returned? But she\ncould not even be quite sure that he ever had a son; and if he existed\nanywhere he had been too long away. When Captain Hagberd got excited in\nhis talk she would steady him by a pretence of belief, laughing a little\nto salve her conscience.\n\nOnly once she had tried pityingly to throw some doubt on that hope\ndoomed to disappointment, but the effect of her attempt had scared her\nvery much. All at once over that man\u2019s face there came an expression of\nhorror and incredulity, as though he had seen a crack open out in the\nfirmament.\n\n\u201cYou--you--you don\u2019t think he\u2019s drowned!\u201d\n\nFor a moment he seemed to her ready to go out of his mind, for in his\nordinary state she thought him more sane than people gave him credit\nfor. On that occasion the violence of the emotion was followed by a most\npaternal and complacent recovery.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t alarm yourself, my dear,\u201d he said a little cunningly: \u201cthe sea\ncan\u2019t keep him. He does not belong to it. None of us Hagberds ever did\nbelong to it. Look at me; I didn\u2019t get drowned. Moreover, he isn\u2019t\na sailor at all; and if he is not a sailor he\u2019s bound to come back.\nThere\u2019s nothing to prevent him coming back....\u201d\n\nHis eyes began to wander.\n\n\u201cTo-morrow.\u201d\n\nShe never tried again, for fear the man should go out of his mind on\nthe spot. He depended on her. She seemed the only sensible person in\nthe town; and he would congratulate himself frankly before her face\non having secured such a levelheaded wife for his son. The rest of the\ntown, he confided to her once, in a fit of temper, was certainly queer.\nThe way they looked at you--the way they talked to you! He had never got\non with any one in the place. Didn\u2019t like the people. He would not have\nleft his own country if it had not been clear that his son had taken a\nfancy to Colebrook.\n\nShe humoured him in silence, listening patiently by the fence;\ncrocheting with downcast eyes. Blushes came with difficulty on her\ndead-white complexion, under the negligently twisted opulence of\nmahogany-coloured hair. Her father was frankly carroty.\n\nShe had a full figure; a tired, unrefreshed face. When Captain Hagberd\nvaunted the necessity and propriety of a home and the delights of one\u2019s\nown fireside, she smiled a little, with her lips only. Her home delights\nhad been confined to the nursing of her father during the ten best years\nof her life.\n\nA bestial roaring coming out of an upstairs window would interrupt their\ntalk. She would begin at once to roll up her crochet-work or fold her\nsewing, without the slightest sign of haste. Meanwhile the howls and\nroars of her name would go on, making the fishermen strolling upon the\nsea-wall on the other side of the road turn their heads towards the\ncottages. She would go in slowly at the front door, and a moment\nafterwards there would fall a profound silence. Presently she would\nreappear, leading by the hand a man, gross and unwieldy like a\nhippopotamus, with a bad-tempered, surly face.\n\nHe was a widowed boat-builder, whom blindness had overtaken years before\nin the full flush of business. He behaved to his daughter as if she\nhad been responsible for its incurable character. He had been heard to\nbellow at the top of his voice, as if to defy Heaven, that he did not\ncare: he had made enough money to have ham and eggs for his breakfast\nevery morning. He thanked God for it, in a fiendish tone as though he\nwere cursing.\n\nCaptain Hagberd had been so unfavourably impressed by his tenant, that\nonce he told Miss Bessie, \u201cHe is a very extravagant fellow, my dear.\u201d\n\nShe was knitting that day, finishing a pair of socks for her father, who\nexpected her to keep up the supply dutifully. She hated knitting,\nand, as she was just at the heel part, she had to keep her eyes on her\nneedles.\n\n\u201cOf course it isn\u2019t as if he had a son to provide for,\u201d Captain\nHagberd went on a little vacantly. \u201cGirls, of course, don\u2019t require so\nmuch--h\u2019m-h\u2019m. They don\u2019t run away from home, my dear.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Miss Bessie, quietly.\n\nCaptain Hagberd, amongst the mounds of turned-up earth, chuckled. With\nhis maritime rig, his weather-beaten face, his beard of Father Neptune,\nhe resembled a deposed sea-god who had exchanged the trident for the\nspade.\n\n\u201cAnd he must look upon you as already provided for, in a manner. That\u2019s\nthe best of it with the girls. The husbands...\u201d He winked. Miss\nBessie, absorbed in her knitting, coloured faintly.\n\n\u201cBessie! my hat!\u201d old Carvil bellowed out suddenly. He had been sitting\nunder the tree mute and motionless, like an idol of some remarkably\nmonstrous superstition. He never opened his mouth but to howl for her,\nat her, sometimes about her; and then he did not moderate the terms of\nhis abuse. Her system was never to answer him at all; and he kept up\nhis shouting till he got attended to--till she shook him by the arm, or\nthrust the mouthpiece of his pipe between his teeth. He was one of the\nfew blind people who smoke. When he felt the hat being put on his head\nhe stopped his noise at once. Then he rose, and they passed together\nthrough the gate.\n\nHe weighed heavily on her arm. During their slow, toilful walks she\nappeared to be dragging with her for a penance the burden of that infirm\nbulk. Usually they crossed the road at once (the cottages stood in the\nfields near the harbour, two hundred yards away from the end of the\nstreet), and for a long, long time they would remain in view, ascending\nimperceptibly the flight of wooden steps that led to the top of the\nsea-wall. It ran on from east to west, shutting out the Channel like a\nneglected railway embankment, on which no train had ever rolled within\nmemory of man. Groups of sturdy fishermen would emerge upon the sky,\nwalk along for a bit, and sink without haste. Their brown nets, like the\ncobwebs of gigantic spiders, lay on the shabby grass of the slope; and,\nlooking up from the end of the street, the people of the town would\nrecognise the two Carvils by the creeping slowness of their gait.\nCaptain Hagberd, pottering aimlessly about his cottages, would raise his\nhead to see how they got on in their promenade.\n\nHe advertised still in the Sunday papers for Harry Hagberd. These sheets\nwere read in foreign parts to the end of the world, he informed Bessie.\nAt the same time he seemed to think that his son was in England--so\nnear to Colebrook that he would of course turn up \u201cto-morrow.\u201d Bessie,\nwithout committing herself to that opinion in so many words, argued that\nin that case the expense of advertising was unnecessary; Captain Hagberd\nhad better spend that weekly half-crown on himself. She declared she did\nnot know what he lived on. Her argumentation would puzzle him and cast\nhim down for a time. \u201cThey all do it,\u201d he pointed out. There was a whole\ncolumn devoted to appeals after missing relatives. He would bring the\nnewspaper to show her. He and his wife had advertised for years; only\nshe was an impatient woman. The news from Colebrook had arrived the very\nday after her funeral; if she had not been so impatient she might have\nbeen here now, with no more than one day more to wait. \u201cYou are not an\nimpatient woman, my dear.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve no patience with you sometimes,\u201d she would say.\n\nIf he still advertised for his son he did not offer rewards for\ninformation any more; for, with the muddled lucidity of a mental\nderangement he had reasoned himself into a conviction as clear as\ndaylight that he had already attained all that could be expected in that\nway. What more could he want? Colebrook was the place, and there was no\nneed to ask for more. Miss Carvil praised him for his good sense, and\nhe was soothed by the part she took in his hope, which had become his\ndelusion; in that idea which blinded his mind to truth and probability,\njust as the other old man in the other cottage had been made blind, by\nanother disease, to the light and beauty of the world.\n\nBut anything he could interpret as a doubt--any coldness of assent, or\neven a simple inattention to the development of his projects of a home\nwith his returned son and his son\u2019s wife--would irritate him into flings\nand jerks and wicked side glances. He would dash his spade into\nthe ground and walk to and fro before it. Miss Bessie called it his\ntantrums. She shook her finger at him. Then, when she came out again,\nafter he had parted with her in anger, he would watch out of the corner\nof his eyes for the least sign of encouragement to approach the iron\nrailings and resume his fatherly and patronising relations.\n\nFor all their intimacy, which had lasted some years now, they had never\ntalked without a fence or a railing between them. He described to her\nall the splendours accumulated for the setting-up of their housekeeping,\nbut had never invited her to an inspection. No human eye was to behold\nthem till Harry had his first look. In fact, nobody had ever been\ninside his cottage; he did his own housework, and he guarded his son\u2019s\nprivilege so jealously that the small objects of domestic use he bought\nsometimes in the town were smuggled rapidly across the front garden\nunder his canvas coat. Then, coming out, he would remark apologetically,\n\u201cIt was only a small kettle, my dear.\u201d\n\nAnd, if not too tired with her drudgery, or worried beyond endurance by\nher father, she would laugh at him with a blush, and say: \u201cThat\u2019s all\nright, Captain Hagberd; I am not impatient.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, my dear, you haven\u2019t long to wait now,\u201d he would answer with a\nsudden bashfulness, and looking uneasily, as though he had suspected\nthat there was something wrong somewhere.\n\nEvery Monday she paid him his rent over the railings. He clutched\nthe shillings greedily. He grudged every penny he had to spend on his\nmaintenance, and when he left her to make his purchases his bearing\nchanged as soon as he got into the street. Away from the sanction of her\npity, he felt himself exposed without defence. He brushed the walls with\nhis shoulder. He mistrusted the queerness of the people; yet, by then,\neven the town children had left off calling after him, and the tradesmen\nserved him without a word. The slightest allusion to his clothing had\nthe power to puzzle and frighten especially, as if it were something\nutterly unwarranted and incomprehensible.\n\nIn the autumn, the driving rain drummed on his sailcloth suit saturated\nalmost to the stiffness of sheet-iron, with its surface flowing with\nwater. When the weather was too bad, he retreated under the tiny porch,\nand, standing close against the door, looked at his spade left planted\nin the middle of the yard. The ground was so much dug up all over, that\nas the season advanced it turned to a quagmire. When it froze hard, he\nwas disconsolate. What would Harry say? And as he could not have so much\nof Bessie\u2019s company at that time of the year, the roars of old Carvil,\nthat came muffled through the closed windows, calling her indoors,\nexasperated him greatly.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t that extravagant fellow get you a servant?\u201d he asked\nimpatiently one mild afternoon. She had thrown something over her head\nto run out for a while.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said the pale Bessie, wearily, staring away with her\nheavy-lidded, grey, and unexpectant glance. There were always smudgy\nshadows under her eyes, and she did not seem able to see any change or\nany end to her life.\n\n\u201cYou wait till you get married, my dear,\u201d said her only friend, drawing\ncloser to the fence. \u201cHarry will get you one.\u201d\n\nHis hopeful craze seemed to mock her own want of hope with so bitter an\naptness that in her nervous irritation she could have screamed at him\noutright. But she only said in self-mockery, and speaking to him as\nthough he had been sane, \u201cWhy, Captain Hagberd, your son may not even\nwant to look at me.\u201d\n\nHe flung his head back and laughed his throaty affected cackle of anger.\n\n\u201cWhat! That boy? Not want to look at the only sensible girl for miles\naround? What do you think I am here for, my dear--my dear--my dear?...\nWhat? You wait. You just wait. You\u2019ll see to-morrow. I\u2019ll soon--\u201d\n\n\u201cBessie! Bessie! Bessie!\u201d howled old Carvil inside. \u201cBessie!--my pipe!\u201d\n That fat blind man had given himself up to a very lust of laziness. He\nwould not lift his hand to reach for the things she took care to leave\nat his very elbow. He would not move a limb; he would not rise from his\nchair, he would not put one foot before another, in that parlour (where\nhe knew his way as well as if he had his sight), without calling her to\nhis side and hanging all his atrocious weight on her shoulder. He would\nnot eat one single mouthful of food without her close attendance. He had\nmade himself helpless beyond his affliction, to enslave her better. She\nstood still for a moment, setting her teeth in the dusk, then turned and\nwalked slowly indoors.\n\nCaptain Hagberd went back to his spade. The shouting in Carvil\u2019s cottage\nstopped, and after a while the window of the parlour downstairs was lit\nup. A man coming from the end of the street with a firm leisurely step\npassed on, but seemed to have caught sight of Captain Hagberd, because\nhe turned back a pace or two. A cold white light lingered in the western\nsky. The man leaned over the gate in an interested manner.\n\n\u201cYou must be Captain Hagberd,\u201d he said, with easy assurance.\n\nThe old man spun round, pulling out his spade, startled by the strange\nvoice.\n\n\u201cYes, I am,\u201d he answered nervously.\n\nThe other, smiling straight at him, uttered very slowly: \u201cYou\u2019ve been\nadvertising for your son, I believe?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy son Harry,\u201d mumbled Captain Hagberd, off his guard for once. \u201cHe\u2019s\ncoming home tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe devil he is!\u201d The stranger marvelled greatly, and then went on,\nwith only a slight change of tone: \u201cYou\u2019ve grown a beard like Father\nChristmas himself.\u201d\n\nCaptain Hagberd drew a little nearer, and leaned forward over his\nspade. \u201cGo your way,\u201d he said, resentfully and timidly at the same time,\nbecause he was always afraid of being laughed at. Every mental\nstate, even madness, has its equilibrium based upon self-esteem. Its\ndisturbance causes unhappiness; and Captain Hagberd lived amongst a\nscheme of settled notions which it pained him to feel disturbed by\npeople\u2019s grins. Yes, people\u2019s grins were awful. They hinted at something\nwrong: but what? He could not tell; and that stranger was obviously\ngrinning--had come on purpose to grin. It was bad enough on the streets,\nbut he had never before been outraged like this.\n\nThe stranger, unaware how near he was of having his head laid open with\na spade, said seriously: \u201cI am not trespassing where I stand, am I? I\nfancy there\u2019s something wrong about your news. Suppose you let me come\nin.\u201d\n\n\u201c_You_ come in!\u201d murmured old Hagberd, with inexpressible horror.\n\n\u201cI could give you some real information about your son--the very latest\ntip, if you care to hear.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d shouted Hagberd. He began to pace wildly to and fro, he shouldered\nhis spade, he gesticulated with his other arm. \u201cHere\u2019s a fellow--a\ngrinning fellow, who says there\u2019s something wrong. I\u2019ve got more\ninformation than you\u2019re aware of. I\u2019ve all the information I want.\nI\u2019ve had it for years--for years--for years--enough to last me till\nto-morrow. Let you come in, indeed! What would Harry say?\u201d\n\nBessie Carvil\u2019s figure appeared in black silhouette on the parlour\nwindow; then, with the sound of an opening door, flitted out before the\nother cottage, all black, but with something white over her head.\nThese two voices beginning to talk suddenly outside (she had heard them\nindoors) had given her such an emotion that she could not utter a sound.\n\nCaptain Hagberd seemed to be trying to find his way out of a cage. His\nfeet squelched in the puddles left by his industry. He stumbled in the\nholes of the ruined grass-plot. He ran blindly against the fence.\n\n\u201cHere, steady a bit!\u201d said the man at the gate, gravely stretching his\narm over and catching him by the sleeve. \u201cSomebody\u2019s been trying to get\nat you. Hallo! what\u2019s this rig you\u2019ve got on? Storm canvas, by George!\u201d\n He had a big laugh. \u201cWell, you _are_ a character!\u201d\n\nCaptain Hagberd jerked himself free, and began to back away shrinkingly.\n\u201cFor the present,\u201d he muttered, in a crestfallen tone.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with him?\u201d The stranger addressed Bessie with the\nutmost familiarity, in a deliberate, explanatory tone. \u201cI didn\u2019t want\nto startle the old man.\u201d He lowered his voice as though he had known\nher for years. \u201cI dropped into a barber\u2019s on my way, to get a twopenny\nshave, and they told me there he was something of a character. The old\nman has been a character all his life.\u201d\n\nCaptain Hagberd, daunted by the allusion to his clothing, had retreated\ninside, taking his spade with him; and the two at the gate, startled\nby the unexpected slamming of the door, heard the bolts being shot, the\nsnapping of the lock, and the echo of an affected gurgling laugh within.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to upset him,\u201d the man said, after a short silence.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of all this? He isn\u2019t quite crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has been worrying a long time about his lost son,\u201d said Bessie, in a\nlow, apologetic tone.\n\n\u201cWell, I am his son.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d she cried--and was profoundly silent.\n\n\u201cKnow my name? Friends with the old man, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s our landlord,\u201d Bessie faltered out, catching hold of the iron\nrailing.\n\n\u201cOwns both them rabbit-hutches, does he?\u201d commented young Hagberd,\nscornfully; \u201cjust the thing he would be proud of. Can you tell me who\u2019s\nthat chap coming to-morrow? You must know something of it. I tell you,\nit\u2019s a swindle on the old man--nothing else.\u201d\n\nShe did not answer, helpless before an insurmountable difficulty,\nappalled before the necessity, the impossibility and the dread of an\nexplanation in which she and madness seemed involved together.\n\n\u201cOh--I am so sorry,\u201d she murmured.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he said, with serenity. \u201cYou needn\u2019t be afraid\nof upsetting me. It\u2019s the other fellow that\u2019ll be upset when he least\nexpects it. I don\u2019t care a hang; but there will be some fun when he\nshows his mug to-morrow. I don\u2019t care _that_ for the old man\u2019s pieces,\nbut right is right. You shall see me put a head on that coon--whoever he\nis!\u201d\n\nHe had come nearer, and towered above her on the other side of the\nrailings. He glanced at her hands. He fancied she was trembling, and it\noccurred to him that she had her part perhaps in that little game that\nwas to be sprung on his old man to-morrow. He had come just in time\nto spoil their sport. He was entertained by the idea--scornful of the\nbaffled plot. But all his life he had been full of indulgence for all\nsorts of women\u2019s tricks. She really was trembling very much; her wrap\nhad slipped off her head. \u201cPoor devil!\u201d he thought. \u201cNever mind about\nthat chap. I daresay he\u2019ll change his mind before to-morrow. But what\nabout me? I can\u2019t loaf about the gate til the morning.\u201d\n\nShe burst out: \u201cIt is _you_--you yourself that he\u2019s waiting for. It is\n_you_ who come to-morrow.\u201d\n\nHe murmured. \u201cOh! It\u2019s me!\u201d blankly, and they seemed to become\nbreathless together. Apparently he was pondering over what he had heard;\nthen, without irritation, but evidently perplexed, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t\nunderstand. I hadn\u2019t written or anything. It\u2019s my chum who saw the paper\nand told me--this very morning.... Eh? what?\u201d\n\nHe bent his ear; she whispered rapidly, and he listened for a while,\nmuttering the words \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cI see\u201d at times. Then, \u201cBut why won\u2019t\ntoday do?\u201d he queried at last.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t understand me!\u201d she exclaimed, impatiently. The clear\nstreak of light under the clouds died out in the west. Again he stooped\nslightly to hear better; and the deep night buried everything of the\nwhispering woman and the attentive man, except the familiar contiguity\nof their faces, with its air of secrecy and caress.\n\nHe squared his shoulders; the broad-brimmed shadow of a hat sat\ncavalierly on his head. \u201cAwkward this, eh?\u201d he appealed to her.\n\u201cTo-morrow? Well, well! Never heard tell of anything like this. It\u2019s all\nto-morrow, then, without any sort of to-day, as far as I can see.\u201d\n\nShe remained still and mute.\n\n\u201cAnd you have been encouraging this funny notion,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI never contradicted him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat for should I?\u201d she defended herself. \u201cIt would only have made him\nmiserable. He would have gone out of his mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis mind!\u201d he muttered, and heard a short nervous laugh from her.\n\n\u201cWhere was the harm? Was I to quarrel with the poor old man? It was\neasier to half believe it myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye, aye,\u201d he meditated, intelligently. \u201cI suppose the old chap got\naround you somehow with his soft talk. You are good-hearted.\u201d\n\nHer hands moved up in the dark nervously. \u201cAnd it might have been true.\nIt was true. It has come. Here it is. This is the to-morrow we have been\nwaiting for.\u201d\n\nShe drew a breath, and he said, good-humouredly: \u201cAye, with the door\nshut. I wouldn\u2019t care if... And you think he could be brought round\nto recognise me... Eh? What?... You could do it? In a week you\nsay? H\u2019m, I daresay you could--but do you think I could hold out a\nweek in this dead-alive place? Not me! I want either hard work, or an\nall-fired racket, or more space than there is in the whole of England. I\nhave been in this place, though, once before, and for more than a week.\nThe old man was advertising for me then, and a chum I had with me had\na notion of getting a couple quid out of him by writing a lot of silly\nnonsense in a letter. That lark did not come off, though. We had to\nclear out--and none too soon. But this time I\u2019ve a chum waiting for me\nin London, and besides...\u201d\n\nBessie Carvil was breathing quickly.\n\n\u201cWhat if I tried a knock at the door?\u201d he suggested.\n\n\u201cTry,\u201d she said.\n\nCaptain Hagberd\u2019s gate squeaked, and the shadow of the son moved on,\nthen stopped with another deep laugh in the throat, like the father\u2019s,\nonly soft and gentle, thrilling to the woman\u2019s heart, awakening to her\nears.\n\n\u201cHe isn\u2019t frisky--is he? I would be afraid to lay hold of him. The chaps\nare always telling me I don\u2019t know my own strength.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the most harmless creature that ever lived,\u201d she interrupted.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t say so if you had seen him chasing me upstairs with a hard\nleather strap,\u201d he said; \u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten it in sixteen years.\u201d\n\nShe got warm from head to foot under another soft, subdued laugh. At the\nrat-tat-tat of the knocker her heart flew into her mouth.\n\n\u201cHey, dad! Let me in. I am Harry, I am. Straight! Come back home a day\ntoo soon.\u201d\n\nOne of the windows upstairs ran up.\n\n\u201cA grinning, information fellow,\u201d said the voice of old Hagberd, up in\nthe darkness. \u201cDon\u2019t you have anything to do with him. It will spoil\neverything.\u201d\n\nShe heard Harry Hagberd say, \u201cHallo, dad,\u201d then a clanging clatter. The\nwindow rumbled down, and he stood before her again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like old times. Nearly walloped the life out of me to stop me\ngoing away, and now I come back he throws a confounded shovel at my head\nto keep me out. It grazed my shoulder.\u201d\n\nShe shuddered.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t care,\u201d he began, \u201conly I spent my last shillings on the\nrailway fare and my last twopence on a shave--out of respect for the old\nman.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you really Harry Hagberd?\u201d she asked. \u201cCan you prove it?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I prove it? Can any one else prove it?\u201d he said jovially. \u201cProve\nwith what? What do I want to prove? There isn\u2019t a single corner in the\nworld, barring England, perhaps, where you could not find some man, or\nmore likely woman, that would remember me for Harry Hagberd. I am more\nlike Harry Hagberd than any man alive; and I can prove it to you in a\nminute, if you will let me step inside your gate.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome in,\u201d she said.\n\nHe entered then the front garden of the Carvils. His tall shadow strode\nwith a swagger; she turned her back on the window and waited, watching\nthe shape, of which the footfalls seemed the most material part. The\nlight fell on a tilted hat; a powerful shoulder, that seemed to cleave\nthe darkness; on a leg stepping out. He swung about and stood still,\nfacing the illuminated parlour window at her back, turning his head from\nside to side, laughing softly to himself.\n\n\u201cJust fancy, for a minute, the old man\u2019s beard stuck on to my chin. Hey?\nNow say. I was the very spit of him from a boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d she murmured to herself.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s about as far as it goes. He was always one of your domestic\ncharacters. Why, I remember how he used to go about looking very sick\nfor three days before he had to leave home on one of his trips to South\nShields for coal. He had a standing charter from the gas-works. You\nwould think he was off on a whaling cruise--three years and a tail. Ha,\nha! Not a bit of it. Ten days on the outside. The Skimmer of the Seas\nwas a smart craft. Fine name, wasn\u2019t it? Mother\u2019s uncle owned her....\u201d\n\nHe interrupted himself, and in a lowered voice, \u201cDid he ever tell you\nwhat mother died of?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Miss Bessie, bitterly; \u201cfrom impatience.\u201d\n\nHe made no sound for a while; then brusquely: \u201cThey were so afraid I\nwould turn out badly that they fairly drove me away. Mother nagged at me\nfor being idle, and the old man said he would cut my soul out of my\nbody rather than let me go to sea. Well, it looked as if he would do it\ntoo--so I went. It looks to me sometimes as if I had been born to them\nby a mistake--in that other hutch of a house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere ought you to have been born by rights?\u201d Bessie Carvil interrupted\nhim, defiantly.\n\n\u201cIn the open, upon a beach, on a windy night,\u201d he said, quick as\nlightning. Then he mused slowly. \u201cThey were characters, both of them, by\nGeorge; and the old man keeps it up well--don\u2019t he? A damned shovel on\nthe--Hark! who\u2019s that making that row? \u2018Bessie, Bessie.\u2019 It\u2019s in your\nhouse.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for me,\u201d she said, with indifference.\n\nHe stepped aside, out of the streak of light. \u201cYour husband?\u201d he\ninquired, with the tone of a man accustomed to unlawful trysts. \u201cFine\nvoice for a ship\u2019s deck in a thundering squall.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo; my father. I am not married.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou seem a fine girl, Miss Bessie, dear,\u201d he said at once.\n\nShe turned her face away.\n\n\u201cOh, I say,--what\u2019s up? Who\u2019s murdering him?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants his tea.\u201d She faced him, still and tall, with averted head,\nwith her hands hanging clasped before her.\n\n\u201cHadn\u2019t you better go in?\u201d he suggested, after watching for a while the\nnape of her neck, a patch of dazzling white skin and soft shadow above\nthe sombre line of her shoulders. Her wrap had slipped down to her\nelbows. \u201cYou\u2019ll have all the town coming out presently. I\u2019ll wait here a\nbit.\u201d\n\nHer wrap fell to the ground, and he stooped to pick it up; she had\nvanished. He threw it over his arm, and approaching the window squarely\nhe saw a monstrous form of a fat man in an armchair, an unshaded lamp,\nthe yawning of an enormous mouth in a big flat face encircled by a\nragged halo of hair--Miss Bessie\u2019s head and bust. The shouting stopped;\nthe blind ran down. He lost himself in thinking how awkward it was.\nFather mad; no getting into the house. No money to get back; a hungry\nchum in London who would begin to think he had been given the go-by.\n\u201cDamn!\u201d he muttered. He could break the door in, certainly; but\nthey would perhaps bundle him into chokey for that without asking\nquestions--no great matter, only he was confoundedly afraid of being\nlocked up, even in mistake. He turned cold at the thought. He stamped\nhis feet on the sodden grass.\n\n\u201cWhat are you?--a sailor?\u201d said an agitated voice.\n\nShe had flitted out, a shadow herself, attracted by the reckless shadow\nwaiting under the wall of her home.\n\n\u201cAnything. Enough of a sailor to be worth my salt before the mast. Came\nhome that way this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere do you come from?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cRight away from a jolly good spree,\u201d he said, \u201cby the London\ntrain--see? Ough! I hate being shut up in a train. I don\u2019t mind a house\nso much.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d she said; \u201cthat\u2019s lucky.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause in a house you can at any time open the blamed door and walk\naway straight before you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd never come back?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot for sixteen years at least,\u201d he laughed. \u201cTo a rabbit hutch, and\nget a confounded old shovel...\u201d\n\n\u201cA ship is not so very big,\u201d she taunted.\n\n\u201cNo, but the sea is great.\u201d\n\nShe dropped her head, and as if her ears had been opened to the voices\nof the world, she heard, beyond the rampart of sea-wall, the swell\nof yesterday\u2019s gale breaking on the beach with monotonous and solemn\nvibrations, as if all the earth had been a tolling bell.\n\n\u201cAnd then, why, a ship\u2019s a ship. You love her and leave her; and a\nvoyage isn\u2019t a marriage.\u201d He quoted the sailor\u2019s saying lightly.\n\n\u201cIt is not a marriage,\u201d she whispered.\n\n\u201cI never took a false name, and I\u2019ve never yet told a lie to a woman.\nWhat lie? Why, _the_ lie--. Take me or leave me, I say: and if you take\nme, then it is...\u201d He hummed a snatch very low, leaning against the\nwall.\n\n    \u201cOh, ho, ho Rio!\n     And fare thee well,\n     My bonnie young girl,\n     We\u2019re bound to Rio Grande.\u201d\n\n\u201cCapstan song,\u201d he explained. Her teeth chattered.\n\n\u201cYou are cold,\u201d he said. \u201cHere\u2019s that affair of yours I picked up.\u201d She\nfelt his hands about her, wrapping her closely. \u201cHold the ends together\nin front,\u201d he commanded.\n\n\u201cWhat did you come here for?\u201d she asked, repressing a shudder.\n\n\u201cFive quid,\u201d he answered, promptly. \u201cWe let our spree go on a little too\nlong and got hard up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been drinking?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBlind three days; on purpose. I am not given that way--don\u2019t you think.\nThere\u2019s nothing and nobody that can get over me unless I like. I can be\nas steady as a rock. My chum sees the paper this morning, and says he to\nme: \u2018Go on, Harry: loving parent. That\u2019s five quid sure.\u2019 So we scraped\nall our pockets for the fare. Devil of a lark!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a hard heart, I am afraid,\u201d she sighed.\n\n\u201cWhat for? For running away? Why! he wanted to make a lawyer\u2019s clerk of\nme--just to please himself. Master in his own house; and my poor mother\negged him on--for my good, I suppose. Well, then--so long; and I went.\nNo, I tell you: the day I cleared out, I was all black and blue from his\ngreat fondness for me. Ah! he was always a bit of a character. Look at\nthat shovel now. Off his chump? Not much. That\u2019s just exactly like my\ndad. He wants me here just to have somebody to order about. However,\nwe two were hard up; and what\u2019s five quid to him--once in sixteen hard\nyears?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, but I am sorry for you. Did you never want to come back home?\u201d\n\n\u201cBe a lawyer\u2019s clerk and rot here--in some such place as this?\u201d he cried\nin contempt. \u201cWhat! if the old man set me up in a home to-day, I would\nkick it down about my ears--or else die there before the third day was\nout.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd where else is it that you hope to die?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the bush somewhere; in the sea; on a blamed mountain-top for choice.\nAt home? Yes! the world\u2019s my home; but I expect I\u2019ll die in a hospital\nsome day. What of that? Any place is good enough, as long as I\u2019ve lived;\nand I\u2019ve been everything you can think of almost but a tailor or a\nsoldier. I\u2019ve been a boundary rider; I\u2019ve sheared sheep; and humped my\nswag; and harpooned a whale. I\u2019ve rigged ships, and prospected for gold,\nand skinned dead bullocks,--and turned my back on more money than the\nold man would have scraped in his whole life. Ha, ha!\u201d\n\nHe overwhelmed her. She pulled herself together and managed to utter,\n\u201cTime to rest now.\u201d\n\nHe straightened himself up, away from the wall, and in a severe voice\nsaid, \u201cTime to go.\u201d\n\nBut he did not move. He leaned back again, and hummed thoughtfully a bar\nor two of an outlandish tune.\n\nShe felt as if she were about to cry. \u201cThat\u2019s another of your cruel\nsongs,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cLearned it in Mexico--in Sonora.\u201d He talked easily. \u201cIt is the song of\nthe Gambucinos. You don\u2019t know? The song of restless men. Nothing could\nhold them in one place--not even a woman. You used to meet one of them\nnow and again, in the old days, on the edge of the gold country, away\nnorth there beyond the Rio Gila. I\u2019ve seen it. A prospecting engineer\nin Mazatlan took me along with him to help look after the waggons.\nA sailor\u2019s a handy chap to have about you anyhow. It\u2019s all a\ndesert: cracks in the earth that you can\u2019t see the bottom of; and\nmountains--sheer rocks standing up high like walls and church spires,\nonly a hundred times bigger. The valleys are full of boulders and black\nstones. There\u2019s not a blade of grass to see; and the sun sets more red\nover that country than I have seen it anywhere--blood-red and angry. It\n_is_ fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not want to go back there again?\u201d she stammered out.\n\nHe laughed a little. \u201cNo. That\u2019s the blamed gold country. It gave me the\nshivers sometimes to look at it--and we were a big lot of men together,\nmind; but these Gambucinos wandered alone. They knew that country before\nanybody had ever heard of it. They had a sort of gift for prospecting,\nand the fever of it was on them too; and they did not seem to want the\ngold very much. They would find some rich spot, and then turn their\nbacks on it; pick up perhaps a little--enough for a spree--and then be\noff again, looking for more. They never stopped long where there were\nhouses; they had no wife, no chick, no home, never a chum. You couldn\u2019t\nbe friends with a Gambucino; they were too restless--here to-day, and\ngone, God knows where, to-morrow. They told no one of their finds, and\nthere has never been a Gambucino well off. It was not for the gold they\ncared; it was the wandering about looking for it in the stony country\nthat got into them and wouldn\u2019t let them rest; so that no woman yet born\ncould hold a Gambucino for more than a week. That\u2019s what the song says.\nIt\u2019s all about a pretty girl that tried hard to keep hold of a Gambucino\nlover, so that he should bring her lots of gold. No fear! Off he went,\nand she never saw him again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat became of her?\u201d she breathed out.\n\n\u201cThe song don\u2019t tell. Cried a bit, I daresay. They were the fellows:\nkiss and go. But it\u2019s the looking for a thing--a something...\nSometimes I think I am a sort of Gambucino myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo woman can hold you, then,\u201d she began in a brazen voice, which\nquavered suddenly before the end.\n\n\u201cNo longer than a week,\u201d he joked, playing upon her very heartstrings\nwith the gay, tender note of his laugh; \u201cand yet I am fond of them all.\nAnything for a woman of the right sort. The scrapes they got me into,\nand the scrapes they got me out of! I love them at first sight. I\u2019ve\nfallen in love with you already, Miss--Bessie\u2019s your name--eh?\u201d\n\nShe backed away a little, and with a trembling laugh:\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen my face yet.\u201d\n\nHe bent forward gallantly. \u201cA little pale: it suits some. But you are a\nfine figure of a girl, Miss Bessie.\u201d\n\nShe was all in a flutter. Nobody had ever said so much to her before.\n\nHis tone changed. \u201cI am getting middling hungry, though. Had no\nbreakfast to-day. Couldn\u2019t you scare up some bread from that tea for me,\nor--\u201d\n\nShe was gone already. He had been on the point of asking her to let him\ncome inside. No matter. Anywhere would do. Devil of a fix! What would\nhis chum think?\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you as a beggar,\u201d he said, jestingly, taking a piece\nof bread-and-butter from the plate she held before him. \u201cI asked as a\nfriend. My dad is rich, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe starves himself for your sake.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I have starved for his whim,\u201d he said, taking up another piece.\n\n\u201cAll he has in the world is for you,\u201d she pleaded.\n\n\u201cYes, if I come here to sit on it like a dam\u2019 toad in a hole. Thank you;\nand what about the shovel, eh? He always had a queer way of showing his\nlove.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could bring him round in a week,\u201d she suggested, timidly.\n\nHe was too hungry to answer her; and, holding the plate submissively to\nhis hand, she began to whisper up to him in a quick, panting voice.\nHe listened, amazed, eating slower and slower, till at last his jaws\nstopped altogether. \u201cThat\u2019s his game, is it?\u201d he said, in a rising tone\nof scathing contempt. An ungovernable movement of his arm sent the plate\nflying out of her fingers. He shot out a violent curse.\n\nShe shrank from him, putting her hand against the wall.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d he raged. \u201cHe expects! Expects _me_--for his rotten money!...\nWho wants his home? Mad--not he! Don\u2019t you think. He wants his own way.\nHe wanted to turn me into a miserable lawyer\u2019s clerk, and now he wants\nto make of me a blamed tame rabbit in a cage. Of me! Of me!\u201d His subdued\nangry laugh frightened her now.\n\n\u201cThe whole world ain\u2019t a bit too big for me to spread my elbows in, I\ncan tell you--what\u2019s your name--Bessie--let alone a dam\u2019 parlour in a\nhutch. Marry! He wants me to marry and settle! And as likely as not he\nhas looked out the girl too--dash my soul! And do you know the Judy, may\nI ask?\u201d\n\nShe shook all over with noiseless dry sobs; but he was fuming and\nfretting too much to notice her distress. He bit his thumb with rage at\nthe mere idea. A window rattled up.\n\n\u201cA grinning, information fellow,\u201d pronounced old Hagberd dogmatically,\nin measured tones. And the sound of his voice seemed to Bessie to make\nthe night itself mad--to pour insanity and disaster on the earth. \u201cNow\nI know what\u2019s wrong with the people here, my dear. Why, of course!\nWith this mad chap going about. Don\u2019t you have anything to do with him,\nBessie. Bessie, I say!\u201d\n\nThey stood as if dumb. The old man fidgeted and mumbled to himself at\nthe window. Suddenly he cried, piercingly: \u201cBessie--I see you. I\u2019ll tell\nHarry.\u201d\n\nShe made a movement as if to run away, but stopped and raised her hands\nto her temples. Young Hagberd, shadowy and big, stirred no more than a\nman of bronze. Over their heads the crazy night whimpered and scolded in\nan old man\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cSend him away, my dear. He\u2019s only a vagabond. What you want is a good\nhome of your own. That chap has no home--he\u2019s not like Harry. He can\u2019t\nbe Harry. Harry is coming to-morrow. Do you hear? One day more,\u201d he\nbabbled more excitedly; \u201cnever you fear--Harry shall marry you.\u201d\n\nHis voice rose very shrill and mad against the regular deep soughing of\nthe swell coiling heavily about the outer face of the sea-wall.\n\n\u201cHe will have to. I shall make him, or if not\u201d--he swore a great\noath--\u201cI\u2019ll cut him off with a shilling to-morrow, and leave everything\nto you. I shall. To you. Let him starve.\u201d\n\nThe window rattled down.\n\nHarry drew a deep breath, and took one step toward Bessie. \u201cSo it\u2019s\nyou--the girl,\u201d he said, in a lowered voice. She had not moved, and she\nremained half turned away from him, pressing her head in the palms of\nher hands. \u201cMy word!\u201d he continued, with an invisible half-smile on his\nlips. \u201cI have a great mind to stop....\u201d\n\nHer elbows were trembling violently.\n\n\u201cFor a week,\u201d he finished without a pause.\n\nShe clapped her hands to her face.\n\nHe came up quite close, and took hold of her wrists gently. She felt his\nbreath on her ear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a scrape I am in--this, and it is you that must see me through.\u201d\n He was trying to uncover her face. She resisted. He let her go then, and\nstepping back a little, \u201cHave you got any money?\u201d he asked. \u201cI must be\noff now.\u201d\n\nShe nodded quickly her shamefaced head, and he waited, looking away from\nher, while, trembling all over and bowing her neck, she tried to find\nthe pocket of her dress.\n\n\u201cHere it is!\u201d she whispered. \u201cOh, go away! go away for God\u2019s sake! If I\nhad more--more--I would give it all to forget--to make you forget.\u201d\n\nHe extended his hand. \u201cNo fear! I haven\u2019t forgotten a single one of you\nin the world. Some gave me more than money--but I am a beggar now--and\nyou women always had to get me out of my scrapes.\u201d\n\nHe swaggered up to the parlour window, and in the dim light filtering\nthrough the blind, looked at the coin lying in his palm. It was a\nhalf-sovereign. He slipped it into his pocket. She stood a little on\none side, with her head drooping, as if wounded; with her arms hanging\npassive by her side, as if dead.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t buy me in,\u201d he said, \u201cand you can\u2019t buy yourself out.\u201d\n\nHe set his hat firmly with a little tap, and next moment she felt\nherself lifted up in the powerful embrace of his arms. Her feet lost the\nground; her head hung back; he showered kisses on her face with a silent\nand over-mastering ardour, as if in haste to get at her very soul. He\nkissed her pale cheeks, her hard forehead, her heavy eyelids, her faded\nlips; and the measured blows and sighs of the rising tide accompanied\nthe enfolding power of his arms, the overwhelming might of his caresses.\nIt was as if the sea, breaking down the wall protecting all the homes\nof the town, had sent a wave over her head. It passed on; she staggered\nbackwards, with her shoulders against the wall, exhausted, as if she had\nbeen stranded there after a storm and a shipwreck.\n\nShe opened her eyes after awhile; and listening to the firm, leisurely\nfootsteps going away with their conquest, began to gather her skirts,\nstaring all the time before her. Suddenly she darted through the open\ngate into the dark and deserted street.\n\n\u201cStop!\u201d she shouted. \u201cDon\u2019t go!\u201d\n\nAnd listening with an attentive poise of the head, she could not tell\nwhether it was the beat of the swell or his fateful tread that seemed\nto fall cruelly upon her heart. Presently every sound grew fainter, as\nthough she were slowly turning into stone. A fear of this awful silence\ncame to her--worse than the fear of death. She called upon her ebbing\nstrength for the final appeal:\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d\n\nNot even the dying echo of a footstep. Nothing. The thundering of the\nsurf, the voice of the restless sea itself, seemed stopped. There was\nnot a sound--no whisper of life, as though she were alone and lost in\nthat stony country of which she had heard, where madmen go looking for\ngold and spurn the find.\n\nCaptain Hagberd, inside his dark house, had kept on the alert. A window\nran up; and in the silence of the stony country a voice spoke above\nher head, high up in the black air--the voice of madness, lies and\ndespair--the voice of inextinguishable hope. \u201cIs he gone yet--that\ninformation fellow? Do you hear him about, my dear?\u201d\n\nShe burst into tears. \u201cNo! no! no! I don\u2019t hear him any more,\u201d she\nsobbed.\n\nHe began to chuckle up there triumphantly. \u201cYou frightened him away.\nGood girl. Now we shall be all right. Don\u2019t you be impatient, my dear.\nOne day more.\u201d\n\nIn the other house old Carvil, wallowing regally in his arm-chair, with\na globe lamp burning by his side on the table, yelled for her, in a\nfiendish voice: \u201cBessie! Bessie! you Bessie!\u201d\n\nShe heard him at last, and, as if overcome by fate, began to totter\nsilently back toward her stuffy little inferno of a cottage. It had no\nlofty portal, no terrific inscription of forfeited hopes--she did not\nunderstand wherein she had sinned.\n\nCaptain Hagberd had gradually worked himself into a state of noisy\nhappiness up there.\n\n\u201cGo in! Keep quiet!\u201d she turned upon him tearfully, from the doorstep\nbelow.\n\nHe rebelled against her authority in his great joy at having got rid at\nlast of that \u201csomething wrong.\u201d It was as if all the hopeful madness of\nthe world had broken out to bring terror upon her heart, with the voice\nof that old man shouting of his trust in an everlasting to-morrow.",
