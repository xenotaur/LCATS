    "body": "He enters the second bus:\nIts coolness sedating the skin that\nOverlaps his troubled mind.\nHis thoughts pull together\nLike the light, cool flow of the air conditioning.\nHe feels a little pacified\n[Come to thyself, human, the refuge from lies!]\nHe knows the shadow's intangible depth:\nIts vastness having overpowered him these months\nUntil he could not reach the logic that told him\nTo find himself outside its barriers.\nAs he stares out of the window\nhe wonders why she has left.\nHow could she have left without indication\nWhen he has remained angled toward work\nSo that he and his wife can stay alive?\nIn the bus window he sees his diaphanous face--the\nwindows\nOf the Hilton, where he has a job in maintenance,\nPiercing solidly through its head.  He rings the bell\nThe idea of her not home, and legally annulled\nFrom his life--her small crotch not tightened to his\nDesperate thrusts--makes him feel sick.\nHe gets down from the bus.\nHe goes to work.\nHe suddenly knows that he is not in love.",
