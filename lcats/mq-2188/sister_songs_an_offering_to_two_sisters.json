volume.\n\nOne image in the _Proem_ was an unconscious plagiarism from the beautiful\nimage in Mr. Patmore\u2019s _St. Valentine\u2019s Day_:\u2014\n\n    \u201cO baby Spring,\n    That flutter\u2019st sudden \u2019neath the breast of Earth,\n    A month before the birth!\u201d\n\nFinding I could not disengage it without injury to the passage in which\nit is embedded, I have preferred to leave it, with this acknowledgment to\na Poet rich enough to lend to the poor.\n\n1895.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n                                   _To_\n

these the speech of May?\n      A ragged, slag-grey sky\u2014invested so,\n      Mary\u2019s spoilt nursling! wert thou wont to go?\n         Or _thou_, Sun-god and song-god, say\n   Could singer pipe one tiniest linnet-lay,\n      While Song did turn away his face from song?\n            Or who could be\n      In spirit or in body hale for long,\u2014\n         Old \u00c6sculap\u2019s best Master!\u2014lacking thee?\n            At length, then, thou art here!\n            On the earth\u2019s leth\u00e8d ear\n      Thy voice of light rings out exultant, strong;\n   Through dreams she stirs and murmurs at that summons dear:\n         From its red leash my heart strains tamelessly,\n   For Spring leaps in the womb of the young year!\n         Nay, was it not brought forth before,\n            And we waited, to behold it,\n            Till the sun\u2019s hand should unfold it,\n         What the year\u2019s young bosom bore?\n   Even so; it came, nor knew we that it came,\n            In the sun\u2019s eclipse.\n         Yet the birds have plighted vows,\n   And from the branches pipe each other\u2019s name;\n         Yet the season all the boughs\n         Has kindled to the finger-tips,\u2014\n   Mark yonder, how the long laburnum drips\n   Its jocund spilth of fire, its honey of wild flame!\n   Yea, and myself put on swift quickening,\n   And answer to the presence of a sudden Spring.\n   From cloud-zoned pinnacles of the secret spirit\n      Song falls precipitant in dizzying streams;\n   And, like a mountain-hold when war-shouts stir it,\n   The mind\u2019s recess\u00e8d fastness casts to light\n   Its gleaming multitudes, that from every height\n      Unfurl the flaming of a thousand dreams.\n   Now therefore, thou who bring\u2019st the year to birth,\n      Who guid\u2019st the bare and dabbled feet of May;\n   Sweet stem to that rose Christ, who from the earth\n   Suck\u2019st our poor prayers, conveying them to Him;\n      Be aidant, tender Lady, to my lay!\n      Of thy two maidens somewhat must I say,\n   Ere shadowy twilight lashes, drooping, dim\n               Day\u2019s dreamy eyes from us;\n               Ere eve has struck and furled\n   The beamy-textured tent transpicuous,\n      Of webb\u00e8d coerule wrought and woven calms,\n         Whence has paced forth the lambent-footed sun.\n   And Thou disclose my flower of song upcurled,\n         Who from Thy fair irradiant palms\n      Scatterest all love and loveliness as alms;\n               Yea, Holy One,\n   Who coin\u2019st Thyself to beauty for the world!\n\n   _Then_, _Spring\u2019s little children_, _your lauds do ye upraise_\n   _To Sylvia_, _O Sylvia_, _her sweet_, _feat ways_!\n      _Your lovesome labours lay away_,\n      _And trick you out in holiday_,\n               _For syllabling to Sylvia_;\n   _And all you birds on branches_, _lave your mouths with May_,\n      _To bear with me this burthen_,\n               _For singing to Sylvia_.\n\n\n\nPart the First\n\n\n   THE leaves dance, the leaves sing,\n   The leaves dance in the breath of the Spring.\n            I bid them dance,\n               I bid them sing,\n            For the limpid glance\n               Of my ladyling;\n   For the gift to the Spring of a dewier spring,\n   For God\u2019s good grace of this ladyling!\n   I know in the lane, by the hedgerow track,\n      The long, broad grasses underneath\n   Are warted with rain like a toad\u2019s knobbed back;\n      But here May weareth a rainless wreath.\n   In the new-sucked milk of the sun\u2019s bosom\n   Is dabbled the mouth of the daisy-blossom;\n      The smouldering rosebud chars through its sheath;\n   The lily stirs her snowy limbs,\n            Ere she swims\n   Naked up through her cloven green,\n   Like the wave-born Lady of Love Hellene;\n   And the scattered snowdrop exquisite\n            Twinkles and gleams,\n      As if the showers of the sunny beams\n   Were splashed from the earth in drops of light.\n            Everything\n            That is child of Spring\n      Casts its bud or blossoming\n   Upon the stream of my delight.\n\n   _Their voices_, _that scents are_, _now let them upraise_\n   _To Sylvia_, _O Sylvia_, _her sweet_, _feat ways_!\n      _Their lovely mother them array_,\n      _And prank them out in holiday_,\n               _For syllabling to Sylvia_;\n   _And all the birds on branches lave their mouths with May_,\n      _To bear with me this burthen_,\n         _For singing to Sylvia_.\n\n\n2.\n\n\n   While thus I stood in mazes bound\n      Of vernal sorcery,\n   I heard a dainty dubious sound,\n      As of goodly melody;\n   Which first was faint as if in swound,\n      Then burst so suddenly\n   In warring concord all around,\n      That, whence this thing might be,\n                  To see\n   The very marrow longed in me!\n      It seemed of air, it seemed of ground,\n         And never any witchery\n      Drawn from pipe, or reed, or string,\n      Made such dulcet ravishing.\n      \u2019Twas like no earthly instrument,\n      Yet had something of them all\n      In its rise, and in its fall;\n   As if in one sweet consort there were blent\n      Those archetypes celestial\n   Which our endeavouring instruments recall.\n      So heavenly flutes made murmurous plain\n      To heavenly viols, that again\n      \u2014Aching with music\u2014wailed back pain;\n      Regals release their notes, which rise\n      Welling, like tears from heart to eyes;\n      And the harp thrills with thronging sighs.\n      Horns in mellow flattering\n      Parley with the cithern-string:\u2014\n      Hark!\u2014the floating, long-drawn note\n      Woos the throbbing cithern-string!\n\n   _Their pretty_, _pretty prating those citherns sure upraise_\n   _For homage unto Sylvia_, _her sweet_, _feat ways_:\n      _Those flutes do flute their vowelled lay_,\n      _Their lovely languid language say_,\n         _For lisping to Sylvia_;\n   _Those viols\u2019 lissom bowings break the heart of May_,\n      _And harps harp their burthen_,\n         _For singing to Sylvia_.\n\n\n3.\n\n\n      Now at that music and that mirth\n      Rose, as \u2019twere, veils from earth;\n            And I spied\n            How beside\n      Bud, bell, bloom, an elf\n      Stood, or was the flower itself\n            \u2019Mid radiant air\n            All the fair\n      Frequence swayed in irised wavers.\n      Some against the gleaming rims\n      Their bosoms prest\n      Of the kingcups, to the brims\n      Filled with sun, and their white limbs\n      Bath\u00e8d in those golden lavers;\n      Some on the brown, glowing breast\n      Of that Indian maid, the pansy,\n      (Through its tenuous veils confest\n      Of swathing light), in a quaint fancy\n      Tied her knot of yellow favours;\n      Others dared open draw\n      Snapdragon\u2019s dreadful jaw:\n      Some, just sprung from out the soil,\n      Sleeked and shook their rumpled fans\n         Dropt with sheen\n            Of moony green;\n      Others, not yet extricate,\n      On their hands leaned their weight,\n      And writhed them free with mickle toil,\n      Still folded in their veiny vans:\n      And all with an unsought accord\n      Sang together from the sward;\n      Whence had come, and from sprites\n      Yet unseen, those delights,\n      As of tempered musics blent,\n      Which had given me such content.\n      For haply our best instrument,\n      Pipe or cithern, stopped or strung,\n      Mimics but some spirit tongue.\n\n   _Their amiable voices_, _I bid them upraise_\n   _To Sylvia_, _O Sylvia_, _her sweet_, _feat ways_;\n      _Their lovesome labours laid away_,\n      _To linger out this holiday_\n            _In syllabling to Sylvia_;\n   _While all the birds on branches lave their mouths with May_,\n   _To bear with me this burthen_,\n         _For singing to Sylvia_.\n\n\n4.\n\n\n      Next I saw, wonder-whist,\n      How from the atmosphere a mist,\n      So it seemed, slow uprist;\n      And, looking from those elfin swarms,\n            I was \u2019ware\n            How the air\n      Was all populous with forms\n      Of the Hours, floating down,\n      Like Nereids through a watery town.\n      Some, with languors of waved arms,\n      Fluctuous oared their flexile way;\n      Some were borne half resupine\n   On the a\u00ebrial hyaline,\n   Their fluid limbs and rare array\n   Flickering on the wind, as quivers\n   Trailing weed in running rivers;\n   And others, in far prospect seen,\n   Newly loosed on this terrene,\n      Shot in piercing swiftness came,\n      With hair a-stream like pale and goblin flame.\n      As cryst\u00e1lline ice in water,\n      Lay in air each faint daughter;\n      Inseparate (or but separate dim)\n      Circumfused wind from wind-like vest,\n      Wind-like vest from wind-like limb.\n      But outward from each lucid breast,\n      When some passion left its haunt,\n      Radiate surge of colour came,\n      Diffusing blush-wise, palpitant,\n      Dying all the filmy frame.\n      With some sweet tenderness they would\n   Turn to an amber-clear and glossy gold;\n      Or a fine sorrow, lovely to behold,\n   Would sweep them as the sun and wind\u2019s joined flood\n      Sweeps a greening-sapphire sea;\n      Or they would glow enamouredly\n   Illustrious sanguine, like a grape of blood;\n   Or with mantling poetry\n   Curd to the tincture which the opal hath,\n   Like rainbows thawing in a moonbeam bath.\n   So paled they, flushed they, swam they, sang melodiously.\n\n   _Their chanting_, _soon fading_, _let them_, _too_, _upraise_\n   _For homage unto Sylvia_, _her sweet_, _feat ways_;\n      _Weave with suave float their wav\u00e8d way_,\n      _And colours take of holiday_,\n            _For syllabling to Sylvia_;\n   _And all the birds on branches lave their mouths with May_,\n      _To bear with me this burthen_,\n            _For singing to Sylvia_.\n\n\n5.\n\n\n      Then, through those translucencies,\n      As grew my senses clearer clear,\n      Did I see, and did I hear,\n      How under an elm\u2019s canopy\n      Wheeled a flight of Dryades\n      Murmuring measured melody.\n      Gyre in gyre their treading was,\n      Wheeling with an adverse flight,\n      In twi-circle o\u2019er the grass,\n      These to left, and those to right;\n               All the band\n      Link\u00e8d by each other\u2019s hand;\n      Decked in raiment stain\u00e8d as\n      The blue-helm\u00e8d aconite.\n      And they advance with flutter, with grace,\n               To the dance\n      Moving on with a dainty pace,\n      As blossoms mince it on river swells.\n      Over their heads their cymbals shine,\n      Round each ankle gleams a twine\n               Of twinkling bells\u2014\n      Tune twirled golden from their cells.\n      Every step was a tinkling sound,\n      As they glanced in their dancing-ground,\n      Clouds in cluster with such a sailing\n      Float o\u2019er the light of the wasting moon,\n      As the cloud of their gliding veiling\n      Swung in the sway of the dancing-tune.\n      There was the clash of their cymbals clanging,\n      Ringing of swinging bells clinging their feet;\n      And the clang on wing it seemed a-hanging,\n      Hovering round their dancing so fleet.\u2014\n      I stirred, I rustled more than meet;\n      Whereat they broke to the left and right,\n      With eddying robes like aconite\n               Blue of helm;\n      And I beheld to the foot o\u2019 the elm.\n\n   _They have not tripped those dances_, _betrayed to my gaze_,\n   _To glad the heart of Sylvia_, _beholding of their maze_;\n      _Through barky walls have slid away_,\n      _And tricked them in their holiday_,\n         _For other than for Sylvia_;\n   _While all the birds on branches lave their mouths with May_,\n      _And bear with me this burthen_,\n         _For singing to Sylvia_.\n\n\n6.\n\n\n      Where its umbrage was enrooted,\n            Sat white-suited,\n      Sat green-amiced, and bare-footed,\n         Spring amid her minstrelsy;\n      There she sat amid her ladies,\n            Where the shade is\n      Sheen as Enna mead ere Hades\u2019\n         Gloom fell thwart Persephone.\n      Dewy buds were interstrown\n      Through her tresses hanging down,\n            And her feet\n            Were most sweet,\n      Tinged like sea-stars, rosied brown.\n   A throng of children like to flowers were sown\n   About the grass beside, or clomb her knee:\n   I looked who were that favoured company.\n            And one there stood\n            Against the beamy flood\n   Of sinking day, which, pouring its abundance,\n   Sublimed the illuminous and volute redundance\n   Of locks that, half dissolving, floated round her face;\n            As see I might\n      Far off a lily-cluster poised in sun\n         Dispread its gracile curls of light\n      I knew what chosen child was there in place!\n      I knew there might no brows be, save of one,\n      With such Hesperian fulgence compass\u00e8d,\n   Which in her moving seemed to wheel about her head.\n\n   _O Spring\u2019s little children_, _more loud your lauds upraise_,\n   _For this is even Sylvia_, _with her sweet_, _feat ways_!\n      _Your lovesome labours lay away_,\n      _And prank you out in holiday_,\n            _For syllabling to Sylvia_;\n   _And all you birds on branches_, _lave your mouths with May_,\n         _To bear with me this burthen_\n            _For singing to Sylvia_!\n\n\n7.\n\n\n   Spring, goddess, is it thou, desir\u00e8d long?\n   And art thou girded round with this young train?\u2014\n   If ever I did do thee ease in song,\n   Now of thy grace let me one meed obtain,\n            And list thou to one plain.\n            Oh, keep still in thy train\n   After the years when others therefrom fade,\n         This tiny, well-belov\u00e8d maid!\n   To whom the gate of my heart\u2019s fortalice,\n            With all which in it is,\n   And the shy self who doth therein immew him\n   \u2019Gainst what loud leagurers battailously woo him,\n            I, brib\u00e8d traitor to him,\n            Set open for one kiss.\n\n   _Then suffer_, _Spring_, _thy children_, _that lauds they should\n   upraise_\n   _To Sylvia_, _this Sylvia_, _her sweet_, _feat ways_;\n      _Their lovely labours lay away_,\n      _And trick them out in holiday_,\n            _For syllabling to Sylvia_;\n   _And that all birds on branches lave their mouths with May_,\n      _To bear with me this burthen_,\n            _For singing to Sylvia_.\n\n\n8.\n\n\n               A kiss? for a child\u2019s kiss?\n               Aye, goddess, even for this.\n      Once, bright Sylviola! in days not far,\n   Once\u2014in that nightmare-time which still doth haunt\n   My dreams, a grim, unbidden visitant\u2014\n               Forlorn, and faint, and stark,\n   I had endured through watches of the dark\n      The abashless inquisition of each star,\n   Yea, was the outcast mark\n            Of all those heavenly passers\u2019 scrutiny;\n            Stood bound and helplessly\n   For Time to shoot his barb\u00e8d minutes at me;\n   Suffered the trampling hoof of every hour\n            In night\u2019s slow-wheel\u00e8d car;\n      Until the tardy dawn dragged me at length\n      From under those dread wheels; and, bled of strength,\n         I waited the inevitable last.\n            Then there came past\n   A child; like thee, a spring-flower; but a flower\n   Fallen from the budded coronal of Spring,\n   And through the city-streets blown withering.\n   She passed,\u2014O brave, sad, lovingest, tender thing!\u2014\n   And of her own scant pittance did she give,\n            That I might eat and live:\n   Then fled, a swift and trackless fugitive.\n            Therefore I kissed in thee\n   The heart of Childhood, so divine for me;\n         And her, through what sore ways,\n         And what unchildish days,\n   Borne from me now, as then, a trackless fugitive.\n         Therefore I kissed in thee\n         Her, child! and innocency,\n   And spring, and all things that have gone from me,\n         And that shall never be;\n   All vanished hopes, and all most hopeless bliss,\n         Came with thee to my kiss.\n   And ah! so long myself had strayed afar\n   From child, and woman, and the boon earth\u2019s green,\n   And all wherewith life\u2019s face is fair beseen;\n         Journeying its journey bare\n   Five suns, except of the all-kissing sun\n            Unkissed of one;\n            Almost I had forgot\n            The healing harms,\n   And whitest witchery, a-lurk in that\n   Authentic cestus of two girdling arms:\n         And I remembered not\n      The subtle sanctities which dart\n   From childish lips\u2019 unvalued precious brush,\n   Nor how it makes the sudden lilies push\n      Between the loosening fibres of the heart.\n            Then, that thy little kiss\n            Should be to me all this,\n   Let workaday wisdom blink sage lids thereat;\n   Which towers a flight three hedgerows high, poor bat!\n      And straightway charts me out the empyreal air.\n   Its chart I wing not by, its canon of worth\n   Scorn not, nor reck though mine should breed it mirth:\n   And howso thou and I may be disjoint,\n   Yet still my falcon spirit makes her point\n            Over the covert where\n   Thou, sweetest quarry, hast put in from her!\n\n   (_Soul_, _hush these sad numbers_, _too sad to upraise_\n   _In hymning bright Sylvia_, _unlearn\u2019d in such ways_!\n      _Our mournful moods lay we away_,\n      _And prank our thoughts in holiday_,\n            _For syllabling to Sylvia_;\n   _When all the birds on branches lave their mouths with May_,\n      _To bear with us this burthen_,\n            _For singing to Sylvia_!)\n\n\n9.\n\n\n   Then thus Spring, bounteous lady, made reply:\n   \u201cO lover of me and all my progeny,\n            For grace to you\n   I take her ever to my retinue.\n   Over thy form, dear child, alas! my art\n   Cannot prevail; but mine immortalising\n            Touch I lay upon thy heart.\n            Thy soul\u2019s fair shape\n   In my unfading mantle\u2019s green I drape,\n   And thy white mind shall rest by my devising\n      A Gideon-fleece amid life\u2019s dusty drouth.\n   If Even burst yon glob\u00e8d yellow grape\n   (Which is the sun to mortals\u2019 seal\u00e8d sight)\n            Against her stain\u00e8d mouth;\n            Or if white-handed light\n   Draw thee yet dripping from the quiet pools,\n            Still lucencies and cools,\n   Of sleep, which all night mirror constellate dreams;\n   Like to the sign which led the Israelite,\n            Thy soul, through day or dark,\n   A visible brightness on the chosen ark\n         Of thy sweet body and pure,\n               Shall it assure,\n   With auspice large and tutelary gleams,\n   Appointed solemn courts, and covenanted streams.\u201d\n\n   _Cease_, _Spring\u2019s little children_, _now cease your lauds to raise_;\n   _That dream is past_, _and Sylvia_, _with her sweet_, _feat ways_.\n      _Our lov\u00e8d labour_, _laid away_,\n      _Is smoothly ended_; _said our say_,\n            _Our syllable to Sylvia_.\n   _Make sweet_, _you birds on branches_! _make sweet your mouths with\n   May_!\n      _But borne is this burthen_,\n               _Sung unto Sylvia_.\n\n\n\nPart the Second\n\n\n   AND now, thou elder nursling of the nest;\n         Ere all the intertangled west\n            Be one magnificence\n   Of multitudinous blossoms that o\u2019errun\n   The flaming brazen bowl o\u2019 the burnished sun\n            Which they do flower from,\n   How shall I \u2019stablish _thy_ memorial?\n   Nay, how or with what countenance shall I come\n            To plead in my defence\n            For loving thee at all?\n   I who can scarcely speak my fellows\u2019 speech,\n   Love their love, or mine own love to them teach;\n   A bastard barred from their inheritance,\n      Who seem, in this dim shape\u2019s uneasy nook,\n   Some sun-flower\u2019s spirit which by luckless chance\n      Has mournfully its tenement mistook;\n   When it were better in its right abode,\n   Heartless and happy lackeying its god.\n   How com\u2019st thou, little tender thing of white,\n   Whose very touch full scantly me beseems,\n   How com\u2019st thou resting on my vaporous dreams,\n      Kindling a wraith there of earth\u2019s vernal green?\n            Even so as I have seen,\n      In night\u2019s a\u00ebrial sea with no wind blust\u2019rous,\n   A ribb\u00e8d tract of cloudy malachite\n            Curve a shored crescent wide;\n   And on its slope marge shelving to the night\n      The stranded moon lay quivering like a lustrous\n         Medusa newly washed up from the tide,\n   Lay in an oozy pool of its own deliquious light.\n\n   Yet hear how my excuses may prevail,\n      Nor, tender white orb, be thou opposite!\n   Life and life\u2019s beauty only hold their revels\n   In the abysmal ocean\u2019s luminous levels.\n            There, like the phantasms of a poet pale,\n   The exquisite marvels sail:\n   Clarified silver; greens and azures frail\n   As if the colours sighed themselves away,\n   And blent in supersubtile interplay\n      As if they swooned into each other\u2019s arms;\n            Repured vermilion,\n            Like ear-tips \u2019gainst the sun;\n   And beings that, under night\u2019s swart pinion,\n   Make every wave upon the harbour-bars\n            A beaten yolk of stars.\n   But where day\u2019s glance turns baffled from the deeps,\n            Die out those lovely swarms;\n   And in the immense profound no creature glides or creeps.\n\n   Love and love\u2019s beauty only hold their revels\n   In life\u2019s familiar, penetrable levels:\n            What of its ocean-floor?\n            I dwell there evermore.\n            From almost earliest youth\n            I raised the lids o\u2019 the truth,\n   And forced her bend on me her shrinking sight;\n   Ever I knew me Beauty\u2019s eremite,\n      In antre of this lowly body set.\n         Girt with a thirsty solitude of soul.\n            Nathless I not forget\n   How I have, even as the anchorite,\n      I too, imperishing essences that console.\n   Under my ruined passions, fallen and sere,\n      The wild dreams stir like little radiant girls,\n   Whom in the moulted plumage of the year\n      Their comrades sweet have buried to the curls.\n   Yet, though their dedicated amorist,\n   How often do I bid my visions hist,\n      Deaf to them, pleading all their piteous fills;\n   Who weep, as weep the maidens of the mist\n      Clinging the necks of the unheeding hills:\n   And their tears wash them lovelier than before,\n   That from grief\u2019s self our sad delight grows more,\n   Fair are the soul\u2019s uncrisp\u00e8d calms, indeed,\n      Endiapered with many a spiritual form\n            Of blosmy-tinctured weed;\n   But scarce itself is conscious of the store\n      Suckled by it, and only after storm\n   Casts up its loosened thoughts upon the shore.\n         To this end my deeps are stirred;\n         And I deem well why life unshared\n         Was ordain\u00e8d me of yore.\n         In pairing-time, we know, the bird\n         Kindles to its deepmost splendour,\n         And the tender\n         Voice is tenderest in its throat;\n         Were its love, for ever nigh it,\n         Never by it,\n         It might keep a vernal note,\n         The crocean and amethystine\n               In their pristine\n            Lustre linger on its coat.\n         Therefore must my song-bower lone be,\n               That my tone be\n            Fresh with dewy pain alway;\n         She, who scorns my dearest care ta\u2019en,\n               An uncertain\n            Shadow of the sprite of May.\n         And is my song sweet, as they say?\n   \u2019Tis sweet for one whose voice has no reply,\n               Save silence\u2019s sad cry:\n   And are its plumes a burning bright array?\n   They burn for an unincarnated eye\n   A bubble, charioteered by the inward breath\n      Which, ardorous for its own invisible lure,\n   Urges me glittering to a\u00ebrial death,\n      I am rapt towards that bodiless paramour;\n   Blindly the uncomprehended tyranny\n      Obeying of my heart\u2019s impetuous might.\n         The earth and all its planetary kin,\n   Starry buds tangled in the whirling hair\n   That flames round the Phoebean wassailer,\n      Speed no more ignorant, more predestined flight,\n         Than I, _her_ viewless tresses netted in.\n   As some most beautiful one, with lovely taunting,\n   Her eyes of guileless guile o\u2019ercanopies,\n            Does her hid visage bow,\n   And miserly your covetous gaze allow,\n            By inchmeal, coy degrees,\n            Saying\u2014\u201cCan you see me now?\u201d\n   Yet from the mouth\u2019s reflex you guess the wanting\n            Smile of the coming eyes\n   In all their upturned grievous witcheries,\n            Before that sunbreak rise;\n   And each still hidden feature view within\n   Your mind, as eager scrutinies detail\n   The moon\u2019s young rondure through the shamefast veil\n         Drawn to her gleaming chin:\n               After this wise,\n   From the enticing smile of earth and skies\n   I dream my unknown Fair\u2019s refus\u00e8d gaze;\n   And guessingly her love\u2019s close traits devise,\n         Which she with subtile coquetries\n   Through little human glimpses slow displays,\n            Cozening my mateless days\n            By sick, intolerable delays.\n   And so I keep mine uncompanioned ways;\n   And so my touch, to golden poesies\n   Turning love\u2019s bread, is bought at hunger\u2019s price.\n   So,\u2014in the inextinguishable wars\n   Which roll song\u2019s Orient on the sullen night\n   Whose ragged banners in their own despite\n   Take on the tinges of the hated light,\u2014\n   So Sultan Phoebus has his Janizars.\n   But if mine unappeas\u00e8d cicatrices\n            Might get them lawful ease;\n   Were any gentle passion hallowed me,\n      Who must none other breath of passion feel\n      Save such as winnows to the fledg\u00e8d heel\n         The tremulous Paradisal plumages;\n         The conscious sacramental trees\n               Which ever be\n               Shaken celestially,\n   Consentient with enamoured wings, might know my love for thee.\n   Yet is there more, whereat none guesseth, love!\n      Upon the ending of my deadly night\n   (Whereof thou hast not the surmise, and slight\n   Is all that any mortal knows thereof),\n      Thou wert to me that earnest of day\u2019s light,\n   When, like the back of a gold-mail\u00e8d saurian\n      Heaving its slow length from Nilotic slime,\n   The first long gleaming fissure runs Aurorian\n      Athwart the yet dun firmament of prime.\n   Stretched on the margin of the cruel sea\n            Whence they had rescued me,\n      With faint and painful pulses was I lying;\n            Not yet discerning well\n   If I had \u2019scaped, or were an icicle,\n            Whose thawing is its dying.\n   Like one who sweats before a despot\u2019s gate,\n   Summoned by some presaging scroll of fate,\n   And knows not whether kiss or dagger wait;\n   And all so sickened is his countenance,\n   The courtiers buzz, \u201cLo, doomed!\u201d and look at him askance:\u2014\n            At Fate\u2019s dread portal then\n            Even so stood I, I ken,\n   Even so stood I, between a joy and fear,\n   And said to mine own heart, \u201cNow if the end be here!\u201d\n\n         They say, Earth\u2019s beauty seems completest\n            To them that on their death-beds rest;\n         Gentle lady! she smiles sweetest\n            Just ere she clasp us to her breast.\n   And I,\u2014now _my_ Earth\u2019s countenance grew bright,\n   Did she but smile me towards that nuptial-night?\n   But whileas on such dubious bed I lay,\n                  One unforgotten day,\n         As a sick child waking sees\n            Wide-eyed daisies\n         Gazing on it from its hand,\n         Slipped there for its dear amazes;\n         So between thy father\u2019s knees\n            I saw _thee_ stand,\n            And through my hazes\n   Of pain and fear thine eyes\u2019 young wonder shone.\n   Then, as flies scatter from a carrion,\n      Or rooks in spreading gyres like broken smoke\n      Wheel, when some sound their quietude has broke,\n   Fled, at thy countenance, all that doubting spawn:\n         The heart which I had questioned spoke,\n   A cry impetuous from its depths was drawn,\u2014\n   \u201cI take the omen of this face of dawn!\u201d\n   And with the omen to my heart cam\u2019st thou.\n            Even with a spray of tears\n   That one light draft was fixed there for the years.\n\n            And now?\u2014\n   The hours I tread ooze memories of thee, Sweet!\n         Beneath my casual feet.\n         With rainfall as the lea,\n            The day is drenched with thee;\n         In little exquisite surprises\n   Bubbling deliciousness of thee arises\n               From sudden places,\n         Under the common traces\n   Of my most lethargied and customed paces.\n\n         As an Arab journeyeth\n         Through a sand of Ayaman,\n         Lean Thirst, lolling its cracked tongue,\n         Lagging by his side along;\n         And a rusty-wing\u00e8d Death\n         Grating its low flight before,\n         Casting ribb\u00e8d shadows o\u2019er\n         The blank desert, blank and tan:\n   He lifts by hap toward where the morning\u2019s roots are\n               His weary stare,\u2014\n      Sees, although they plashless mutes are,\n         Set in a silver air\n      Fountains of gelid shoots are,\n         Making the daylight fairest fair;\n      Sees the palm and tamarind\n   Tangle the tresses of a phantom wind;\u2014\n   A sight like innocence when one has sinned!\n   A green and maiden freshness smiling there,\n            While with unblinking glare\n   The tawny-hided desert crouches watching her.\n\n               \u2019Tis a vision:\n         Yet the greeneries Elysian\n         He has known in tracts afar;\n         Thus the enamouring fountains flow,\n         Those the very palms that grow,\n   By rare-gummed Sava, or Herbalimar.\u2014\n\n         Such a watered dream has tarried\n         Trembling on my desert arid;\n               Even so\n            Its lovely gleamings\n               Seemings show\n            Of things not seemings;\n               And I gaze,\n         Knowing that, beyond my ways,\n               Verily\n            All these _are_, for these are she.\n         Eve no gentlier lays her cooling cheek\n         On the burning brow of the sick earth,\n            Sick with death, and sick with birth,\n      Aeon to aeon, in secular fever twirled,\n            Than thy shadow soothes this weak\n            And distempered being of mine.\n   In all I work, my hand includeth thine;\n            Thou rushest down in every stream\n   Whose passion frets my spirit\u2019s deepening gorge;\n   Unhood\u2019st mine eyas-heart, and fliest my dream;\n            Thou swing\u2019st the hammers of my forge;\n   As the innocent moon, that nothing does but shine,\n   Moves all the labouring surges of the world.\n      Pierce where thou wilt the springing thought in me,\n   And there thy pictured countenance lies enfurled,\n      As in the cut fern lies the imaged tree.\n         This poor song that sings of thee,\n      This fragile song, is but a curled\n         Shell outgathered from thy sea,\n      And murmurous still of its nativity.\n               Princess of Smiles!\n   Sorceress of most unlawful-lawful wiles!\n         Cunning pit for gazers\u2019 senses,\n         Overstrewn with innocences!\n         Purities gleam white like statues\n         In the fair lakes of thine eyes,\n         And I watch the sparkles that use\n               There to rise,\n               Knowing these\n         Are bubbles from the calyces\n         Of the lovely thoughts that breathe\n   Paving, like water-flowers, thy spirit\u2019s floor beneath.\n\n               O thou most dear!\n   Who art thy sex\u2019s complex harmony\n         God-set more facilely;\n         To thee may love draw near\n         Without one blame or fear,\n   Unchidden save by his humility:\n   Thou Perseus\u2019 Shield! wherein I view secure\n   The mirrored Woman\u2019s fateful-fair allure!\n   Whom Heaven still leaves a twofold dignity,\n   As girlhood gentle, and as boyhood free;\n   With whom no most diaphanous webs enwind\n   The bar\u00e8d limbs of the rebukeless mind.\n   Wild Dryad! all unconscious of thy tree,\n               With which indissolubly\n   The tyrannous time shall one day make thee whole;\n   Whose frank arms pass unfretted through its bole:\n         Who wear\u2019st thy femineity\n   Light as entrail\u00e8d blossoms, that shalt find\n   It erelong silver shackles unto thee.\n   Thou whose young sex is yet but in thy soul;\u2014\n         As hoarded in the vine\n   Hang the gold skins of undelirious wine,\n   As air sleeps, till it toss its limbs in breeze:\u2014\n      In whom the mystery which lures and sunders,\n         Grapples and thrusts apart; endears, estranges;\n   \u2014The dragon to its own Hesperides\u2014\n      Is gated under slow-revolving changes,\n   Manifold doors of heavy-hing\u00e8d years.\n      So once, ere Heaven\u2019s eyes were filled with wonders\n         To see Laughter rise from Tears,\n         Lay in beauty not yet mighty,\n            Conch\u00e8d in translucencies,\n         The antenatal Aphrodite,\n   Caved magically under magic seas;\n   Caved dreamlessly beneath the dreamful seas.\n\n            \u201cWhose sex is in thy soul!\u201d\n            What think we of thy soul?\n         Which has no parts, and cannot grow,\n         Unfurled not from an embryo;\n   Born of full stature, lineal to control;\n      And yet a pigmy\u2019s yoke must undergo.\n   Yet must keep pace and tarry, patient, kind,\n   With its unwilling scholar, the dull, tardy mind;\n   Must be obsequious to the body\u2019s powers,\n   Whose low hands mete its paths, set ope and close its ways;\n         Must do obeisance to the days,\n   And wait the little pleasure of the hours;\n      Yea, ripe for kingship, yet must be\n   Captive in statuted minority!\n   So is all power fulfilled, as soul in thee.\n   So still the ruler by the ruled takes rule,\n   And wisdom weaves itself i\u2019 the loom o\u2019 the fool.\n   The splendent sun no splendour can display,\n   Till on gross things he dash his broken ray,\n   From cloud and tree and flower re-tossed in prismy spray.\n   Did not obstruction\u2019s vessel hem it in,\n   Force were not force, would spill itself in vain\n   We know the Titan by his champ\u00e8d chain.\n   Stay is heat\u2019s cradle, it is rocked therein,\n   And by check\u2019s hand is burnished into light;\n   If hate were none, would love burn lowlier bright?\n   God\u2019s Fair were guessed scarce but for opposite sin;\n   Yea, and His Mercy, I do think it well,\n   Is flashed back from the brazen gates of Hell.\n            The heavens decree\n   All power fulfil itself as soul in thee.\n   For supreme Spirit subject was to clay,\n      And Law from its own servants learned a law,\n   And Light besought a lamp unto its way,\n            And Awe was reined in awe,\n         At one small house of Nazareth;\n            And Golgotha\n   Saw Breath to breathlessness resign its breath,\n   And Life do homage for its crown to death.\n\n   So is all power, as soul in thee increased!\n      But, knowing this, in knowledge\u2019s despite\n      I fret against the law severe that stains\n            Thy spirit with eclipse;\n      When\u2014as a nymph\u2019s carven head sweet water drips,\n      For others oozing so the cool delight\n      Which cannot steep her stiffened mouth of stone\u2014\n   Thy nescient lips repeat maternal strains.\n                  Memnonian lips!\n   Smitten with singing from thy mother\u2019s east,\n      And murmurous with music not their own:\n      Nay, the lips flexile, while the mind alone\n            A passionless statue stands.\n            Oh, pardon, innocent one!\n         Pardon at thine unconscious hands!\n   \u201cMurmurous with music not their own,\u201d I say?\n   And in that saying how do I missay,\n            When from the common sands\n   Of poorest common speech of common day\n   Thine accents sift the golden musics out!\n         And ah, we poets, I misdoubt,\n            Are little more than thou!\n   We speak a lesson taught we know not how,\n         And what it is that from us flows\n   The hearer better than the utterer knows.\n\n            Thou canst foreshape thy word;\n            The poet is not lord\n         Of the next syllable may come\n         With the returning pendulum;\n         And what he plans to-day in song,\n   To-morrow sings it in another tongue.\n         Where the last leaf fell from his bough,\n         He knows not if a leaf shall grow,\n         Where he sows he doth not reap,\n         He reapeth where he did not sow;\n         He sleeps, and dreams forsake his sleep\n         To meet him on his waking way.\n   Vision will mate him not by law and vow:\n         Disguised in life\u2019s most hodden-grey,\n   By the most beaten road of everyday\n   She waits him, unsuspected and unknown.\n               The hardest pang whereon\n   He lays his mutinous head may be a Jacob\u2019s stone.\n   In the most iron crag his foot can tread\n               A Dream may strew her bed,\n         And suddenly his limbs entwine,\n   And draw him down through rock as sea-nymphs might through brine.\n   But, unlike those feigned temptress-ladies who\n   In guerdon of a night the lover slew,\n   When the embrace has failed, the rapture fled,\n   Not he, not he, the wild sweet witch is dead!\n               And, though he cherisheth\n   The babe most strangely born from out her death,\n   Some tender trick of her it hath, maybe,\u2014\n                     It is not she!\n\n   Yet, even as the air is rumorous of fray\n      Before the first shafts of the sun\u2019s onslaught\n         From gloom\u2019s black harness splinter,\n         And Summer move on Winter\n   With the trumpet of the March, and the pennon of the May;\n         As gesture outstrips thought;\n   So, haply, toyer with ethereal strings!\n   Are thy blind repetitions of high things\n   The murmurous gnats whose aimless hoverings\n         Reveal song\u2019s summer in the air;\n   The outstretched hand, which cannot thought declare,\n            Yet is thought\u2019s harbinger.\n   These strains the way for thine own strains prepare;\n   We feel the music moist upon this breeze,\n   And hope the congregating poesies.\n         Sundered yet by thee from us\n         Wait, with wild eyes luminous,\n   All thy wing\u00e8d things that are to be;\n   They flit against thee, Gate of Ivory!\n   They clamour on the portress Destiny,\u2014\n   \u201cSet her wide, so we may issue through!\n   Our vans are quick for that they have to do!\u201d\n         Suffer still your young desire;\n   Your plumes but bicker at the tips with fire,\n   Tarry their kindling; they will beat the higher.\n   And thou, bright girl, not long shalt thou repeat\n   Idly the music from thy mother caught;\n            Not vainly has she wrought,\n   Not vainly from the cloudward-jetting turret\n   Of her a\u00ebrial mind, for thy weak feet,\n   Let down the silken ladder of her thought.\n      She bare thee with a double pain,\n         Of the body and the spirit;\n      Thou thy fleshly weeds hast ta\u2019en,\n         Thy diviner weeds inherit!\n   The precious streams which through thy young lips roll\n   Shall leave their lovely delta in thy soul:\n      Where sprites of so essential kind\n               Set their paces,\n      Surely they shall leave behind\n               The green traces\n      Of their sportance in the mind,\n      And thou shalt, ere we well may know it,\n            Turn that daintiness, a poet,\u2014\n               Elfin-ring\n            Where sweet fancies foot and sing.\n         So it may be, so it

back, saddened to my inmost mind;\n   Even as I list a-dream that mother singing\n      The poesy of sweet tone, and sadden, while\n         Her voice is cast in troubled wake behind\n         The

Content?  Yea, title it content.\n   The very loves that belt thee must prevent\n   My love, I know, with their legitimacy:\n   As the metallic vapours, that are swept\n   Athwart the sun, in his light intercept\n               The very hues\n   Which _their_ conflagrant elements effuse.\n         But, my love, my heart, my fair,\n         That only I should see thee rare,\n   Or tent to the hid core thy rarity,\u2014\n      This were a mournfulness more piercing far\n      Than that those other loves my own must bar,\n   Or thine for others leave thee none for me.\n\n         But on a day whereof I think,\n         One shall dip his hand to drink\n         In that still water of thy soul,\n         And its imaged tremors race\n         Over thy joy-troubled face,\n         As the intervolved reflections roll\n         From a shaken fountain\u2019s brink,\n         With swift light wrinkling its alcove.\n         From the hovering wing of Love\n   The warm stain shall flit roseal on thy cheek,\n         Then, sweet blushet!
