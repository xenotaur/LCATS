I have no\nlonger the privilege of assigning anything to anybody, yet encourage any\nof you, especially any who may be physicians, to read the thoughts of a\nfamily doctor of the early 1800's.\n\n\n\n\n\nA misprint kills a sensitive author\n\nAbsolute, peremptory facts are bullies\n\nAdvised every literary man to have a\nprofession.\n\nAfraid of books who have not handled\nthem from
