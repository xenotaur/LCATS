    "body": "It seemed to Colonel Jennings that the air conditioning unit merely\nwashed the hot air around him without lowering the temperature from that\noutside. He knew it was partly psychosomatic, compounded of the view of\nthe silvery spire of the test ship through the heatwaves of the Nevada\nlandscape and the knowledge that this was the day, the hour, and the\nminutes.\n\nThe final test was at hand. The instrument ship was to be sent out into\nspace, controlled from this sunken concrete bunker, to find out if the\nflimsy bodies of men could endure there.\n\nJennings visualized other bunkers scattered through the area,\nobservation posts, and farther away the field headquarters with open\ntelephone lines to the Pentagon, and beyond that a world waiting for\nnews of the test--and not everyone wishing it well.\n\nThe monotonous buzz of the field phone pulled him away from his\nfascinated gaze at the periscope slit. He glanced at his two assistants,\nProfessor Stein and Major Eddy. They were seated in front of their\ncontrol boards, staring at the blank eyes of their radar screens,\npatiently enduring the beads of sweat on their faces and necks and\nhands, the odor of it arising from their bodies. They too were feeling\nthe moment. He picked up the phone.\n\n\"Jennings,\" he said crisply.\n\n\"Zero minus one half hour, Colonel. We start alert count in fifteen\nminutes.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Colonel Jennings spoke softly, showing none of the excitement\nhe felt. He replaced the field phone on its hook and spoke to the two\nmen in front of him.\n\n\"This is it. Apparently this time we'll go through with it.\"\n\nMajor Eddy's shoulders hunched a trifle, as if he were getting set to\nhave a load placed upon them.\n\nProfessor Stein gave no indication that he had heard. His thin body was\nstooped over his instrument bank, intense, alert, as if he were a runner\ncrouched at the starting mark, as if he were young again.\n\nColonel Jennings walked over to the periscope slit again and peered\nthrough the shimmer of heat to where the silvery ship lay arrowed in her\ncradle. The last few moments of waiting, with a brassy taste in his\nmouth, with the vision of the test ship before him; these were the\nworst.\n\nEverything had been done, checked and rechecked hours and days ago. He\nfound himself wishing there were some little thing, some desperate\nlittle error which must be corrected hurriedly, just something to break\nthe tension of waiting.\n\n\"You're all right, Sam, Prof?\" he asked the major and professor\nunnecessarily.\n\n\"A little nervous,\" Major Eddy answered without moving.\n\n\"Of course,\" Professor Stein said. There was a too heavy stress on the\nsibilant sound, as if the last traces of accent had not yet been\nremoved.\n\n\"I expect everyone is nervous, not just the hundreds involved in this,\nbut everywhere,\" Jennings commented. And then ruefully, \"Except\nProfessor Stein there. I thought surely I'd see some nerves at this\npoint, Prof.\" He was attempting to make light conversation, something to\nbreak the strain of mounting buck fever.\n\n\"If I let even one nerve tendril slack, Colonel, I would go to pieces\nentirely,\" Stein said precisely, in the way a man speaks who has learned\nthe language from text books. \"So I do not think of our ship at all. I\nthink of mankind. I wonder if mankind is as ready as our ship. I wonder\nif man will do any better on the planets than he has done here.\"\n\n\"Well, of course,\" Colonel Jennings answered with sympathy in his voice,\n\"under Hitler and all the things you went through, I don't blame you for\nbeing a little bitter. But not all mankind is like that, you know. As\nlong as you've been in our country, Professor, you've never looked\naround you. You've been working on this, never lifting your head....\"\n\n\n\nHe jerked in annoyance as a red light blinked over the emergency\ncircuit, and a buzzing, sharp and repeated, broke into this moment when\nhe felt he was actually reaching, touching Stein, as no one had before.\n\nHe dragged the phone toward him and began speaking angrily into its\nmouthpiece before he had brought it to his lips.\n\n\"What the hell's the matter now? They're not going to call it off again!\nThree times now, and....\"\n\nHe broke off and frowned as the crackling voice came through the\nreceiver, the vein on his temple pulsing in his stress.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, General,\" he said, much more quietly.\n\nThe two men turned from their radar scopes and watched him\nquestioningly. He shrugged his shoulders, an indication to them of his\nhelplessness.\n\n\"You're not going to like this, Jim,\" the general was saying. \"But it's\norders from Pentagon. Are you familiar with Senator O'Noonan?\"\n\n\"Vaguely,\" Jennings answered.\n\n\"You'll be more familiar with him, Jim. He's been newly appointed\nchairman of the appropriations committee covering our work. And he's\nfought it bitterly from the beginning. He's tried every way he could to\nscrap the entire project. When we've finished this test, Jim, we'll have\nused up our appropriations to date. Whether we get any more depends on\nhim.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir?\" Jennings spoke questioningly. Political maneuvering was not\nhis problem, that was between Pentagon and Congress.\n\n\"We must have his support, Jim,\" the general explained. \"Pentagon hasn't\nbeen able to win him over. He's stubborn and violent in his reactions.\nThe fact it keeps him in the headlines--well, of course that wouldn't\nhave any bearing. So Pentagon invited him to come to the field here to\nwatch the test, hoping that would win him over.\" The general hesitated,\nthen continued.\n\n\"I've gone a step farther. I felt if he was actually at the center of\ncontrol, your operation, he might be won over. If he could actually\nparticipate, press the activating key or something, if the headlines\ncould show he was working with us, actually sent the test ship on its\nflight....\"\n\n\"General, you can't,\" Jennings moaned. He forgot rank, everything.\n\n\"I've already done it, Jim,\" the general chose to ignore the outburst.\n\"He's due there now. I'll look to you to handle it. He's got to be won\nover, Colonel. It's your project.\" Considering the years that he and the\ngeneral had worked together, the warm accord and informality between\nthem, the use of Jennings' title made it an order.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he said.\n\n\"Over,\" said the general formally.\n\n\"Out,\" whispered Jennings.\n\nThe two men looked at him questioningly.\n\n\"It seems,\" he answered their look, \"we are to have an observer. Senator\nO'Noonan.\"\n\n\"Even in Germany,\" Professor Stein said quietly, \"they knew enough to\nleave us alone at a critical moment.\"\n\n\"He can't do it, Jim,\" Major Eddy looked at Jennings with pleading eyes.\n\n\"Oh, but he can,\" Jennings answered bitterly. \"Orders. And you know what\norders are, don't you, Major?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Major Eddy said stiffly.\n\nProfessor Stein smiled ruefully.\n\nBoth of them turned back to their instrument boards, their radar\nscreens, to the protective obscurity of subordinates carrying out an\nassignment. They were no longer three men coming close together, almost\nunderstanding one another in this moment of waiting, when the world and\nall in it had been shut away, and nothing real existed except the\nsilvery spire out there on the desert and the life of it in the controls\nat their fingertips.\n\n\"Beep, minus fifteen minutes!\" the first time signal sounded.\n\n\n\n\"Colonel Jennings, sir!\"\n\nThe senator appeared in the low doorway and extended a fleshy hand. His\nvoice was hearty, but there was no warmth behind his tones. He paused on\nthe threshold, bulky, impressive, as if he were about to deliver an\naddress. But Jennings, while shaking hands, drew him into the bunker,\npointedly, causing the senator to raise bushy eyebrows and stare at him\nspeculatively.\n\n\"At this point everything runs on a split second basis, Senator,\" he\nsaid crisply. \"Ceremony comes after the test.\" His implication was that\nwhen the work was done, the senator could have his turn in the\nlimelight, take all the credit, turn it into political fodder to be\nthrown to the people. But because the man was chairman of the\nappropriations committee, he softened his abruptness. \"If the timing is\noff even a small fraction, Senator, we would have to scrap the flight\nand start all over.\"\n\n\"At additional expense, no doubt.\" The senator could also be crisp.\n\"Surprises me that the military should think of that, however.\"\n\nThe closing of the heavy doors behind him punctuated his remark and\ncaused him to step to the center of the bunker. Where there had seemed\nadequate room before, now the feeling was one of oppressive\novercrowding.\n\nUnconsciously, Major Eddy squared his elbows as if to clear the space\naround him for the manipulation of his controls. Professor Stein sat at\nhis radar screen, quiet, immobile, a part of the mechanisms. He was\naccustomed to overbearing authority whatever political tag it might wear\nat the moment.\n\n\"Beep. Eleven minutes,\" the signal sounded.\n\n\"Perhaps you'll be good enough to brief me on just what you're doing\nhere?\" the senator asked, and implied by the tone of his voice that it\ncouldn't be very much. \"In layman's language, Colonel. Don't try to make\nit impressive with technical obscurities. I want my progress report on\nthis project to be understandable to everyone.\"\n\nJennings looked at him in dismay. Was the man kidding him? Explain the\nzenith of science, the culmination of the dreams of man in twenty simple\nwords or less! And about ten minutes to win over a man which the\nPentagon had failed to win.\n\n\"Perhaps you'd like to sit here, Senator,\" he said courteously. \"When we\nlearned you were coming, we felt yours should be the honor. At zero\ntime, you press this key--here. It will be your hand which sends the\ntest ship out into space.\"\n\nApparently they were safe. The senator knew so little, he did not\nrealize the automatic switch would close with the zero time signal, that\nno hand could be trusted to press the key at precisely the right time,\nthat the senator's key was a dummy.\n\n\"Beep, ten,\" the signal came through.\n\nJennings went back over to the periscope and peered through the slit. He\nfelt strangely surprised to see the silver column of the ship still\nthere. The calm, the scientific detachment, the warm thrill of\nco-ordinated effort, all were gone. He felt as if the test flight\nitself was secondary to what the senator thought about it, what he would\nsay in his progress report.\n\nHe wondered if the senator's progress report would compare in any\nparticular with the one on the ship. That was a chart, representing as\nfar as they could tell, the minimum and maximum tolerances of human\nlife. If the multiple needles, tracing their continuous lines, went over\nthe black boundaries of tolerances, human beings would die at that\npoint. Such a progress report, showing the life-sustaining conditions at\neach point throughout the ship's flight, would have some meaning. He\nwondered what meaning the senator's progress report would have.\n\nHe felt himself being pushed aside from the periscope. There was no\nungentleness in the push, simply the determined pressure of an arrogant\nman who was accustomed to being in the center of things, and thinking\nnothing of shoving to get there. The senator gave him the briefest of\nexplanatory looks, and placed his own eye at the periscope slit.\n\n\"Beep, nine,\" the signal sounded.\n\n\"So that's what represents two billion dollars,\" the senator said\ncontemptuously. \"That little sliver of metal.\"\n\n\"The two billion dollar atomic bomb was even smaller,\" Jennings said\nquietly.\n\n\n\nThe senator took his eye away from the periscope briefly and looked at\nJennings speculatively.\n\n\"The story of where all that money went still hasn't been told,\" he said\npointedly. \"But the story of who got away with this two billion will be\ndifferent.\"\n\nColonel Jennings said nothing. The white hot rage mounting within him\nmade it impossible for him to speak.\n\nThe senator straightened up and walked back over to his chair. He waved\na hand in the direction of Major Eddy.\n\n\"What does that man do?\" he asked, as if the major were not present, or\nwas unable to comprehend.\n\n\"Major Eddy,\" Jennings found control of his voice, \"operates remote\ncontrol.\" He was trying to reduce the vast complexity of the operation\nto the simplest possible language.\n\n\"Beep, eight,\" the signal interrupted him.\n\n\"He will guide the ship throughout its entire flight, just as if he were\nsitting in it.\"\n\n\"Why isn't he sitting in it?\" the senator asked.\n\n\"That's what the test is for, Senator.\" Jennings felt his voice becoming\nicy. \"We don't know if space will permit human life. We don't know\nwhat's out there.\"\n\n\"Best way to find out is for a man to go out there and see,\" the senator\ncommented shortly. \"I want to find out something, I go look at it\nmyself. I don't depend on charts and graphs, and folderol.\"\n\nThe major did not even hunch his broad shoulders, a characteristic\ngesture, to show that he had heard, to show that he wished the senator\nwas out there in untested space.\n\n\"What about him? He's not even in uniform!\"\n\n\"Professor Stein maintains sight contact on the scope and transmits the\nIFF pulse.\"\n\nThe senator's eyes flashed again beneath heavy brows. His lips indicated\nwhat he thought of professors and projects who used them.\n\n\"What's IFF?\" he asked.\n\nThe colonel looked at him incredulously. It was on the tip of his tongue\nto ask where the man had been during the war. He decided he'd better not\nask it. He might learn.\n\n\"It stands for Identification--Friend or Foe, Senator. It's army\njargon.\"\n\n\"Beep, seven.\"\n\n_Seven minutes_, Jennings thought, _and here I am trying to explain the\nculmination of the entire science of all mankind to a lardbrain in\nsimple kindergarten words_. Well, he'd wished there was something to\nbreak the tension of the last half hour, keep him occupied. He had it.\n\n\"You mean the army wouldn't know, after the ship got up, whether it was\nours or the enemy's?\" the senator asked incredulously.\n\n\"There are meteors in space, Senator,\" Jennings said carefully. \"Radar\ncontact is all we'll have out there. The IFF mechanism reconverts our\nbeam to a predetermined pulse, and it bounces back to us in a different\npattern. That's the only way we'd know if we were still on the ship, or\nhave by chance fastened on to a meteor.\"\n\n\"What has that got to do with the enemy?\" O'Noonan asked\nuncomprehendingly.\n\nJennings sighed, almost audibly.\n\n\"The mechanism was developed during the war, when we didn't know which\nplanes were ours and which the enemy's. We've simply adapted it to this\nuse--to save money, Senator.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" the senator expressed his disbelief. \"Too complicated. The\nworld has grown too complicated.\"\n\n\"Beep, six.\"\n\nThe senator glanced irritably at the time speaker. It had interrupted\nhis speech. But he chose to ignore the interruption, that was the way to\nhandle heckling.\n\n\"I am a simple man. I come from simple parentage. I represent the simple\npeople, the common people, the people with their feet on the ground. And\nthe whole world needs to get back to the simple truths and\nhonesties....\"\n\nJennings headed off the campaign speech which might appeal to the\nmountaineers of the senator's home state, where a man's accomplishments\nwere judged by how far he could spit tobacco juice; it had little\napplication in this bunker where the final test before the flight of man\nto the stars was being tried.\n\n\"To us, Senator,\" he said gently, \"this ship represents simple truths\nand honesties. We are, at this moment, testing the truths of all that\nmankind has ever thought of, theorized about, believed of the space\nwhich surrounds the Earth. A farmer may hear about new methods of\ngrowing crops, but the only way he knows whether they're practical or\nnot is to try them on his own land.\"\n\nThe senator looked at him impassively. Jennings didn't know whether he\nwas going over or not. But he was trying.\n\n\"All that ship, and all the instruments it contains; those represent the\nutmost honesties of the men who worked on them. Nobody tried to bluff,\nto get by with shoddy workmanship, cover up ignorance. A farmer does not\ntry to bluff his land, for the crops he gets tells the final story.\nScientists, too, have simple honesty. They have to have, Senator, for\nthe results will show them up if they don't.\"\n\n\n\nThe senator looked at him speculatively, and with a growing respect. Not\na bad speech, that. Not a bad speech at all. If this tomfoolery actually\nworked, and it might, that could be the approach in selling it to his\nconstituents. By implication, he could take full credit, put over the\nimpression that it was he who had stood over the scientists making sure\nthey were as honest and simple as the mountain farmers. Many a man has\ngone into the White House with less.\n\n\"Beep, five.\"\n\nFive more minutes. The sudden thought occurred to O'Noonan: what if he\nrefused to press the dummy key? Refused to take part in this project he\ncalled tomfoolery? Perhaps they thought they were being clever in having\nhim take part in the ship's launching, and were by that act committing\nhim to something....\n\n\"This is the final test, Senator. After this one, if it is right, man\nleaps to the stars!\" It was Jennings' plea, his final attempt to catch\nthe senator up in the fire and the dream.\n\n\"And then more yapping colonists wanting statehood,\" the senator said\ndryly. \"Upsetting the balance of power. Changing things.\"\n\nJennings was silent.\n\n\"Beep, four.\"\n\n\"More imports trying to get into our country duty-free,\" O'Noonan went\non. \"Upsetting our economy.\"\n\nHis vision was of lobbyists threatening to cut off contributions if\ntheir own industries were not kept in a favorable position. Of\ngrim-jawed industrialists who could easily put a more tractable\ncandidate up in his place to be elected by the free and thinking people\nof his state. All the best catch phrases, the semantically-loaded\npromises, the advertising appropriations being used by his opponent.\n\nIt was a dilemma. Should he jump on the bandwagon of advancement to the\nstars, hoping to catch the imagination of the voters by it? Were the\nvoters really in favor of progress? What could this space flight put in\nthe dinner pails of the Smiths, the Browns, the Johnsons? It was all\nvery well to talk about the progress of mankind, but that was the only\nmeasure to be considered. Any politician knew that. And apparently no\nscientist knew it. Man advances only when he sees how it will help him\nstuff his gut.\n\n\"Beep, three.\" For a full minute, the senator had sat lost in\nspeculation.\n\nAnd what could he personally gain? A plan, full-formed, sprang into his\nmind. This whole deal could be taken out of the hands of the military\non charges of waste and corruption. It could be brought back into the\ncontrol of private industry, where it belonged. He thought of vast\ntracts of land in his own state, tracts he could buy cheap, through\ndummy companies, places which could be made very suitable for the giant\nfactories necessary to manufacture spaceships.\n\nAs chairman of the appropriations committee, it wouldn't be difficult to\nsway the choice of site. And all that extra employment for the people of\nhis own state. The voters couldn't forget plain, simple, honest O'Noonan\nafter that!\n\n\"Beep, two.\"\n\n\n\nJennings felt the sweat beads increase on his forehead. His collar was\nalready soaking wet. He had been watching the senator through two long\nminutes, terrible eon-consuming minutes, the impassive face showing only\nwhat the senator wanted it to show. He saw the face now soften into\nsomething approaching benignity, nobility. The head came up, the silvery\nhair tossed back.\n\n\"Son,\" he said with a ringing thrill in his voice. \"Mankind must reach\nthe stars! We must allow nothing to stop that! No personal\nconsideration, no personal belief, nothing must stand in the way of\nmankind's greatest dream!\"\n\nHis eyes were shrewdly watching the effect upon Jennings' face,\nmeasuring through him the effect such a speech would have upon the\nvoters. He saw the relief spread over Jennings' face, the glow. Yes, it\nmight work.\n\n\"Now, son,\" he said with kindly tolerance, \"tell me what you want me to\ndo about pressing this key when the time comes.\"\n\n\"Beep, one.\"\n\nAnd then the continuous drone while the seconds were being counted off\naloud.\n\n\"Fifty-nine, fifty-eight, fifty-seven--\"\n\nThe droning went on while Jennings showed the senator just how to press\nthe dummy key down, explaining it in careful detail, and just when.\n\n\"Thirty-seven, thirty-six, thirty-five--\"\n\n\"Major!\" Jennings called questioningly.\n\n\"Ready, sir.\"\n\n\"Professor!\"\n\n\"Ready, sir.\"\n\n\"Three, two, one, ZERO!\"\n\n\"Press it, Senator!\" Jennings called frantically.\n\nAlready the automatic firing stud had taken over. The bellowing, roaring\nflames reached down with giant strength, nudging the ship upward,\nseeming to hang suspended, waiting.\n\n\"_Press it!_\"\n\nThe senator's hand pressed the dummy key. He was committed.\n\nAs if the ship had really been waiting, it lifted, faster and faster.\n\n\"Major?\"\n\n\"I have it, sir.\" The major's hands were flying over his bank of\ncontrols, correcting the slight unbalance of thrusts, holding the ship\nas steady as if he were in it.\n\nAlready the ship was beyond visual sight, picking up speed. But the pip\non the radar screens was strong and clear. The drone of the IFF\nreturning signal was equally strong.\n\nThe senator sat and waited. He had done his job. He felt it perhaps\nwould have been better to have had the photographers on the spot, but\nrealized the carefully directed and rehearsed pictures to be taken later\nwould make better vote fodder.\n\n\"It's already out in space now, Senator,\" Jennings found a second of\ntime to call it to the senator.\n\nThe pips and the signals were bright and clear, coming through the\nionosphere, the Heaviside layer as they had been designed to do.\nJennings wondered if the senator could ever be made to understand the\nsimple honesty of scientists who had worked that out so well and true.\nBright and strong and clear.\n\nAnd then there was nothing! The screens were blank. The sounds were\ngone.\n\n\n\nJennings stood in stupefied silence.\n\n\"It shut! It shut off!\" Major Eddy's voice was shrill in amazement.\n\n\"It cut right out, Colonel. No fade, no dying signal, just out!\" It was\nthe first time Jennings had ever heard a note of excitement in Professor\nStein's voice.\n\nThe phone began to ring, loud and shrill. That would be from the\nGeneral's observation post, where he, too, must have lost the signal.\n\nThe excitement penetrated the senator's rosy dream of vast acreages\nbeing sold at a huge profit, giant walls of factories going up under his\nremote-control ownership. \"What's wrong?\" he asked.\n\nJennings did not answer him. \"What was the altitude?\" he asked. The\nphone continued to ring, but he was not yet ready to answer it.\n\n\"Hundred fifty miles, maybe a little more,\" Major Eddy answered in a\ndull voice. \"And then, nothing,\" he repeated incredulously. \"Nothing.\"\n\nThe phone was one long ring now, taken off of automatic signal and rung\nwith a hand key pressed down and held there. In a daze, Jennings picked\nup the phone.\n\n\"Yes, General,\" he answered as though he were no more than a robot. He\nhardly listened to the general's questions, did not need the report that\nevery radarscope throughout the area had lost contact at the same\ninstant. Somehow he had known that would be true, that it wasn't just\nhis own mechanisms failing. One question did penetrate his stunned mind.\n\n\"How is the senator taking it?\" the general asked finally.\n\n\"Uncomprehending, as yet,\" Jennings answered cryptically. \"But even\nthere it will penetrate sooner or later. We'll have to face it then.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the general sighed. \"What about safety? What if it fell on a big\ncity, for example?\"\n\n\"It had escape velocity,\" Jennings answered. \"It would simply follow its\ntrajectory indefinitely--which was away from Earth.\"\n\n\"What's happening now?\" the senator asked arrogantly. He had been out of\nthe limelight long enough, longer than was usual or necessary. He didn't\nlike it when people went about their business as if he were not\npresent.\n\n\"Quiet during the test, Senator,\" Jennings took his mouth from the phone\nlong enough to reprove the man gently. Apparently he got away with it,\nfor the senator put his finger to his lips knowingly and sat back again.\n\n\"The senator's starting to ask questions?\" the general asked into the\nphone.\n\n\"Yes, sir. It won't be long now.\"\n\n\"I hate to contemplate it, Jim,\" the general said in apprehension.\n\"There's only one way he'll translate it. Two billion dollars shot up\ninto the air and lost.\" Then sharply. \"There must be something you've\ndone, Colonel. Some mistake you've made.\"\n\n\n\nThe implied accusation struck at Jennings' stomach, a heavy blow.\n\n\"That's the way it's going to be?\" he stated the question, knowing its\nanswer.\n\n\"For the good of the service,\" the general answered with a stock phrase.\n\"If it is the fault of one officer and his men, we may be given another\nchance. If it is the failure of science itself, we won't.\"\n\n\"I see,\" the colonel answered.\n\n\"You won't be the first soldier, Colonel, to be unjustly punished to\nmaintain public faith in the service.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Jennings answered as formally as if he were already facing\ncourt martial.\n\n\"It's back!\" Major Eddy shouted in his excitement. \"It's back, Colonel!\"\n\nThe pip, truly, showed startlingly clear and sharp on the radarscope,\nthe correct signals were coming in sure and strong. As suddenly as the\nship had cut out, it was back.\n\n\"It's back, General,\" Colonel Jennings shouted into the phone, his eyes\nfixed upon his own radarscope. He dropped the phone without waiting for\nthe general's answer.\n\n\"Good,\" exclaimed the senator. \"I was getting a little bored with\nnothing happening.\"\n\n\"Have you got control?\" Jennings called to the major.\n\n\"Can't tell yet. It's coming in too fast. I'm trying to slow it. We'll\nknow in a minute.\"\n\n\"You have it now,\" Professor Stein spoke up quietly. \"It's slowing. It\nwill be in the atmosphere soon. Slow it as much as you can.\"\n\nAs surely as if he were sitting in its control room, Eddy slowed the\nship, easing it down into the atmosphere. The instruments recorded the\nresults of his playing upon the bank of controls, as sound pouring from\na musical instrument.\n\n\"At the take-off point?\" Jennings asked. \"Can you land it there?\"\n\n\"Close to it,\" Major Eddy answered. \"As close as I can.\"\n\nNow the ship was in visual sight again, and they watched its nose turn\nin the air, turn from a bullet hurtling earthward to a ship settling to\nthe ground on its belly. Major Eddy was playing his instrument bank as\nif he were the soloist in a vast orchestra at the height of a crescendo\nforte.\n\nJennings grabbed up the phone again.\n\n\"Transportation!\" he shouted.\n\n\"Already dispatched, sir,\" the operator at the other end responded.\n\nThrough the periscope slit, Jennings watched the ship settle lightly\ndownward to the ground, as though it were a breezeborne feather instead\nof its tons of metal. It seemed to settle itself, still, and become\ninanimate again. Major Eddy dropped his hands away from his instrument\nbank, an exhausted virtuoso.\n\n\"My congratulations!\" the senator included all three men in his sweeping\nglance. \"It was remarkable how you all had control at every instance. My\nprogress report will certainly bear that notation.\"\n\nThe three men looked at him, and realized there was no irony in his\nwords, no sarcasm, no realization at all of what had truly happened.\n\n\"I can see a va-a-ast fleet of no-o-ble ships....\" the senator began to\norate.\n\nBut the roar of the arriving jeep outside took his audience away from\nhim. They made a dash for the bunker door, no longer interested in the\nsenator and his progress report. It was the progress report as revealed\nby the instruments on the ship which interested them more.\n\nThe senator was close behind them as they piled out of the bunker door,\nand into the jeep, with Jennings unceremoniously pulling the driver from\nthe wheel and taking his place.\n\nOver the rough dirt road toward the launching site where the ship had\ncome to rest, their minds were bemused and feverish, as they projected\nahead, trying to read in advance what the instruments would reveal of\nthat blank period.\n\nThe senator's mind projected even farther ahead to the fleet of space\nships he would own and control. And he had been worried about some\nignorant stupid voters! Stupid animals! How he despised them! What would\nhe care about voters when he could be master of the spaceways to the\nstars?\n\nJennings swerved the jeep off the dirt road and took out across the\nhummocks of sagebrush to the ship a few rods away. He hardly slacked\nspeed, and in a swirl of dust pulled up to the side of the ship. Before\nit had even stopped, the men were piling out of the jeep, running toward\nthe side of the ship.\n\nAnd stopped short.\n\n\n\nUnable to believe their eyes, to absorb the incredible, they stared at\nthe swinging open door in the side of the ship. Slowly they realized the\niridescent purple glow around the doorframe, the rotted metal,\ndisintegrating and falling to the dirt below. The implications of the\ntampering with the door held them unmoving. Only the senator had not\ncaught it yet. Slower than they, now he was chugging up to where they\nhad stopped, an elephantine amble.\n\n\"Well, well, what's holding us up?\" he panted irritably.\n\nCautiously then, Jennings moved toward the open door. And as cautiously,\nMajor Eddy and Professor Stein followed him. O'Noonan hung behind,\nsensing the caution, but not knowing the reason behind it.\n\nThey entered the ship, wary of what might be lurking inside, what had\nburned open the door out there in space, what had been able to capture\nthe ship, cut it off from its contact with controls, stop it in its\nheadlong flight out into space, turn it, return it to their controls at\nprecisely the same point and altitude. Wary, but they entered.\n\nAt first glance, nothing seemed disturbed. The bulkhead leading to the\npower plant was still whole. But farther down the passage, the door\nleading to the control room where the instruments were housed also swung\nopen. It, too, showed the iridescent purple disintegration of its metal\nframe.\n\nThey hardly recognized the control room. They had known it intimately,\nhad helped to build and fit it. They knew each weld, each nut and bolt.\n\n\"The instruments are gone,\" the professor gasped in awe.\n\nIt was true. As they crowded there in the doorway, they saw the gaping\nholes along the walls where the instruments had been inserted, one by\none, each to tell its own story of conditions in space.\n\nThe senator pushed himself into the room and looked about him. Even he\ncould tell the room had been dismantled.\n\n\"What kind of sabotage is this?\" he exclaimed, and turned in anger\ntoward Jennings. No one answered him. Jennings did not even bother to\nmeet the accusing eyes.\n\nThey walked down the narrow passage between the twisted frames where the\ninstruments should have been. They came to the spot where the master\nintegrator should have stood, the one which should have co-ordinated all\nthe results of life-sustenance measurements, the one which was to give\nthem their progress report.\n\nThere, too, was a gaping hole--but not without its message. Etched in\nthe metal frame, in the same iridescent purple glow, were two words. Two\nenigmatic words to reverberate throughout the world, burned in by some\nwatcher--some keeper--some warden.\n\n\"_Not yet._\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  Typo was corrected on page 110:\n\n  Original text: \"Son,\" he said with a ringing thrill in his voice.\n  \"Mankind much reach the stars!
