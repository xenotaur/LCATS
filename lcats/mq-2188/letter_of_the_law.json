    "body": "The place was dark and damp, and smelled like moldy leaves. Meyerhoff\nfollowed the huge, bear-like Altairian guard down the slippery\nflagstones of the corridor, sniffing the dead, musty air with distaste.\nHe drew his carefully tailored Terran-styled jacket closer about his\nshoulders, shivering as his eyes avoided the black, yawning cell-holes\nthey were passing. His foot slipped on the slimy flags from time to\ntime, and finally he paused to wipe the caked mud from his trouser leg.\n\"How much farther is it?\" he shouted angrily.\n\nThe guard waved a heavy paw vaguely into the blackness ahead. Quite\nsuddenly the corridor took a sharp bend, and the Altairian stopped,\nproducing a huge key ring from some obscure fold of his hairy hide. \"I\nstill don't see any reason for all the fuss,\" he grumbled in a wounded\ntone. \"We've treated him like a brother.\"\n\nOne of the huge steel doors clicked open. Meyerhoff peered into the\nblackness, catching a vaguely human outline against the back wall.\n\"Harry?\" he called sharply.\n\nThere was a startled gasp from within, and a skinny, gnarled little man\nsuddenly appeared in the guard's light, like a grotesque, twisted ghost\nout of the blackness. Wide blue eyes regarded Meyerhoff from beneath\nuneven black eyebrows, and then the little man's face broke into a\ncrafty grin. \"Paul! So they sent _you_! I knew I could count on it!\" He\nexecuted a deep, awkward bow, motioning Meyerhoff into the dark cubicle.\n\"Not much to offer you,\" he said slyly, \"but it's the best I can do\nunder the circumstances.\"\n\nMeyerhoff scowled, and turned abruptly to the guard. \"We'll have some\nprivacy now, if you please. Interplanetary ruling. And leave us the\nlight.\"\n\nThe guard grumbled, and started for the door. \"It's about time you\nshowed up!\" cried the little man in the cell. \"Great day! Lucky they\nsent you, pal. Why, I've been in here for years--\"\n\n\"Look, Zeckler, the name is Meyerhoff, and I'm not your pal,\" Meyerhoff\nsnapped. \"And you've been here for two weeks, three days, and\napproximately four hours. You're getting as bad as your gentle guards\nwhen it comes to bandying the truth around.\" He peered through the dim\nlight at the gaunt face of the prisoner. Zeckler's face was dark with a\nweek's beard, and his bloodshot eyes belied the cocky grin on his lips.\nHis clothes were smeared and sodden, streaked with great splotches of\nmud and moss. Meyerhoff's face softened a little. \"So Harry Zeckler's in\na jam again,\" he said. \"You _look_ as if they'd treated you like a\nbrother.\"\n\nThe little man snorted. \"These overgrown teddy-bears don't know what\nbrotherhood means, nor humanity, either. Bread and water I've been\ngetting, nothing more, and then only if they feel like bringing it\ndown.\" He sank wearily down on the rock bench along the wall. \"I thought\nyou'd never get here! I sent an appeal to the Terran Consulate the first\nday I was arrested. What happened? I mean, all they had to do was get a\nman over here, get the extradition papers signed, and provide\ntransportation off the planet for me. Why so much time? I've been\nsitting here rotting--\" He broke off in mid-sentence and stared at\nMeyerhoff. \"You _brought_ the papers, didn't you? I mean, we can leave\nnow?\"\n\nMeyerhoff stared at the little man with a mixture of pity and disgust.\n\"You are a prize fool,\" he said finally. \"Did you know that?\"\n\nZeckler's eyes widened. \"What do you mean, fool? So I spend a couple of\nweeks in this pneumonia trap. The deal was worth it! I've got three\nmillion credits sitting in the Terran Consulate on Altair V, just\nwaiting for me to walk in and pick them up. Three million credits--do\nyou hear? That's enough to set me up for life!\"\n\nMeyerhoff nodded grimly. \"_If_ you live long enough to walk in and pick\nthem up, that is.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, if?\"\n\nMeyerhoff sank down beside the man, his voice a tense whisper in the\nmusty cell. \"I mean that right now you are practically dead. You may not\nknow it, but you are. You walk into a newly opened planet with your\nsmart little bag of tricks, walk in here with a shaky passport and no\npermit, with no knowledge of the natives outside of two paragraphs of\ninaccuracies in the Explorer's Guide, and even then you're not content\nto come in and sell something legitimate, something the natives might\nconceivably be able to use. No, nothing so simple for you. You have to\npull your usual high-pressure stuff. And this time, buddy, you're paying\nthe piper.\"\n\n\"_You mean I'm not being extradited?_\"\n\nMeyerhoff grinned unpleasantly. \"I mean precisely that. You've committed\na crime here--a major crime. The Altairians are sore about it. And the\nTerran Consulate isn't willing to sell all the trading possibilities\nhere down the river just to get you out of a mess. You're going to stand\ntrial--and these natives are out to get you. Personally, I think they're\n_going_ to get you.\"\n\nZeckler stood up shakily. \"You can't believe anything the natives say,\"\nhe said uneasily. \"They're pathological liars. Why, you should see what\nthey tried to sell _me_! You've never seen such a pack of liars as these\ncritters.\" He glanced up at Meyerhoff. \"They'll probably drop a little\nfine on me and let me go.\"\n\n\"A little fine of one Terran neck.\" Meyerhoff grinned nastily. \"You've\ncommitted the most heinous crime these creatures can imagine, and\nthey're going to get you for it if it's the last thing they do. I'm\nafraid, my friend, that your con-man days are over.\"\n\nZeckler fished in the other man's pocket, extracted a cigarette, and\nlighted it with trembling fingers. \"It's bad, then,\" he said finally.\n\n\"It's bad, all right.\"\n\nSome shadow of the sly, elfin grin crept over the little con-man's face.\n\"Well, at any rate, I'm glad they sent you over,\" he said weakly.\n\"Nothing like a good lawyer to handle a trial.\"\n\n\"_Lawyer?_ Not me! Oh, no. Sorry, but no thanks.\" Meyerhoff chuckled.\n\"I'm your advisor, old boy. Nothing else. I'm here to keep you from\nbotching things up still worse for the Trading Commission, that's all. I\nwouldn't get tangled up in a mess with those creatures for anything!\" He\nshook his head. \"You're your own lawyer, Mr. Super-salesman. It's all\nyour show. And you'd better get your head out of the sand, or you're\ngoing to lose a case like it's never been lost before!\"\n\n\n\nMeyerhoff watched the man's pale face, and shook his head. In a way, he\nthought, it was a pity to see such a change in the rosy-cheeked, dapper,\ncocksure little man who had talked his way glibly in and out of more\njams than Meyerhoff could count. Trading brought scalpers; it was almost\ninevitable that where rich and unexploited trading ground was uncovered,\nit would first fall prey to the fast-trading boys. They spread out from\nTerra with the first wave of exploration--the slick, fast-talking\ncon-men who could work new territories unfettered by the legal\nrestrictions that soon closed down the more established planets. The\nfirst men in were the richest out, and through some curious quirk of the\nTerrestrial mind, they knew they could count on Terran protection,\nhowever crooked and underhand their methods.\n\nBut occasionally a situation arose where the civilization and social\npractices of the alien victims made it unwise to tamper with them.\nAltair I had been recognized at once by the Trading Commission as a\ncommercial prize of tremendous value, but early reports had warned of\nthe danger of wildcat trading on the little, musty, jungle-like planet\nwith its shaggy, three-eyed inhabitants--warned specifically against the\nconfidence tactics so frequently used--but there was always somebody,\nMeyerhoff reflected sourly, who just didn't get the word.\n\nZeckler puffed nervously on his cigarette, his narrow face a study in\ntroubled concentration. \"But I didn't _do_ anything!\" he exploded\nfinally. \"So I pulled an old con game. So what? Why should they get so\nexcited? So I clipped a few thousand credits, pulled a little fast\nbusiness.\" He shrugged eloquently, spreading his hands. \"Everybody's\ndoing it. They do it to each other without batting an eye. You should\n_see_ these critters operate on each other. Why, my little scheme was\npeanuts by comparison.\"\n\nMeyerhoff pulled a pipe from his pocket, and began stuffing the bowl\nwith infinite patience. \"And precisely what sort of con game was it?\" he\nasked quietly.\n\nZeckler shrugged again. \"The simplest, tiredest, moldiest old racket\nthat ever made a quick nickel. Remember the old Terran gag about the\nBrooklyn Bridge? The same thing. Only these critters didn't want\nbridges. They wanted land--this gooey, slimy swamp they call 'farm\nland.' So I gave them what they wanted. I just sold them some land.\"\n\nMeyerhoff nodded fiercely. \"You sure did. A hundred square kilos at a\nswipe. Only you sold the same hundred square kilos to a dozen different\nnatives.\" Suddenly he threw back his hands and roared. \"Of all the\nthings you _shouldn't_ have done--\"\n\n\"But what's a chunk of land?\"\n\nMeyerhoff shook his head hopelessly. \"If you hadn't been so greedy,\nyou'd have found out what a chunk of land was to these natives before\nyou started peddling it. You'd have found out other things about them,\ntoo. You'd have learned that in spite of all their bumbling and fussing\nand squabbling they're not so dull. You'd have found out that they're\nmarsupials, and that two out of five of them get thrown out of their\nmother's pouch before they're old enough to survive. You'd have realized\nthat they have to start fighting for individual rights almost as soon as\nthey're born. Anything goes, as long as it benefits them as\nindividuals.\"\n\nMeyerhoff grinned at the little man's horrified face. \"Never heard of\nthat, had you? And you've never heard of other things, too. You've\nprobably never heard that there are just too many Altairians here for\nthe food their planet can supply, and their diet is so finicky that\nthey just can't live on anything that doesn't grow here. And\nconsequently, land is the key factor in their economy, not money;\nnothing but land. To get land, it's every man for himself, and the loser\nstarves, and their entire legal and monetary system revolves on that\nprinciple. They've built up the most confusing and impossible system of\nbarter and trade imaginable, aimed at individual survival, with land as\nthe value behind the credit. That explains the lying--of course they're\nliars, with an economy like that. They've completely missed the concept\nof truth. Pathological? You bet they're pathological! Only a fool would\ntell the truth when his life depended on his being a better liar than\nthe next guy! Lying is the time-honored tradition, with their entire\nlegal system built around it.\"\n\nZeckler snorted. \"But how could they _possibly_ have a legal system? I\nmean, if they don't recognize the truth when it slaps them in the face?\"\n\nMeyerhoff shrugged. \"As we understand legal systems, I suppose they\ndon't have one. They have only the haziest idea what truth represents,\nand they've shrugged off the idea as impossible and useless.\" He\nchuckled maliciously. \"So you went out and found a chunk of ground in\nthe uplands, and sold it to a dozen separate, self-centered,\nhalf-starved natives! Encroachment on private property is legal grounds\nfor murder on this planet, and twelve of them descended on the same\nchunk of land at the same time, all armed with title-deeds.\" Meyerhoff\nsighed. \"You've got twelve mad Altairians in your hair. You've got a mad\nplanet in your hair. And in the meantime, Terra's most valuable uranium\nsource in five centuries is threatening to cut off supply unless they\nsee your blood splattered liberally all the way from here to the\nequator.\"\n\nZeckler was visibly shaken. \"Look,\" he said weakly, \"so I wasn't so\nsmart. What am I going to do? I mean, are you going to sit quietly by\nand let them butcher me? How could I defend myself in a legal setup like\n_this_?\"\n\nMeyerhoff smiled coolly. \"You're going to get your sly little con-man\nbrain to working, I think,\" he said softly. \"By Interplanetary Rules,\nthey have to give you a trial in Terran legal form--judge, jury, court\nprocedure, all that folderol. They think it's a big joke--after all,\nwhat could a judicial oath mean to them?--but they agreed. Only thing\nis, they're going to hang you, if they die trying. So you'd better get\nthose stunted little wits of yours clicking--and if you try to implicate\n_me_, even a little bit, I'll be out of there so fast you won't know\nwhat happened.\"\n\nWith that Meyerhoff walked to the door. He jerked it inward sharply, and\nspilled two guards over on their faces. \"Privacy,\" he grunted, and\nstarted back up the slippery corridor.\n\n\n\nIt certainly _looked_ like a courtroom, at any rate. In the front of the\nlong, damp stone room was a bench, with a seat behind it, and a small\nstraight chair to the right. To the left was a stand with twelve\nchairs--larger chairs, with a railing running along the front. The rest\nof the room was filled almost to the door with seats facing the bench.\nZeckler followed the shaggy-haired guard into the room, nodding\napprovingly. \"Not such a bad arrangement,\" he said. \"They must have\ngotten the idea fast.\"\n\nMeyerhoff wiped the perspiration from his forehead, and shot the little\ncon-man a stony glance. \"At least you've got a courtroom, a judge, and a\njury for this mess. Beyond that--\" He shrugged eloquently. \"I can't make\nany promises.\"\n\nIn the back of the room a door burst open with a bang. Loud, harsh\nvoices were heard as half a dozen of the huge Altairians attempted to\npush through the door at once. Zeckler clamped on the headset to his\ntranslator unit, and watched the hubbub in the anteroom with growing\nalarm. Finally the question of precedent seemed to be settled, and a\ngroup of the Altairians filed in, in order of stature, stalking across\nthe room in flowing black robes, pug-nosed faces glowering with\nself-importance. They descended upon the jury box, grunting and\nscrapping with each other for the first-row seats, and the judge took\nhis place with obvious satisfaction behind the heavy wooden bench.\nFinally, the prosecuting attorney appeared, flanked by two clerks, who\ntook their places beside him. The prosecutor eyed Zeckler with cold\nmalevolence, then turned and delivered a sly wink at the judge.\n\nIn a moment the room was a hubbub as it filled with the huge, bumbling,\nbear-like creatures, jostling each other and fighting for seats,\ngrowling and complaining. Two small fights broke out in the rear, but\nwere quickly subdued by the group of gendarmes guarding the entrance.\nFinally the judge glared down at Zeckler with all three eyes, and\npounded the bench top with a wooden mallet until the roar of activity\nsubsided. The jurymen wriggled uncomfortably in their seats, exchanging\nwinks, and finally turned their attention to the front of the court.\n\n\"We are reading the case of the people of Altair I,\" the judge's voice\nroared out, \"against one Harry Zeckler--\" he paused for a long,\nimpressive moment--\"Terran.\" The courtroom immediately burst into an\nangry growl, until the judge pounded the bench five or six times more.\n\"This--creature--is hereby accused of the following crimes,\" the judge\nbellowed. \"Conspiracy to overthrow the government of Altair I. Brutal\nmurder of seventeen law-abiding citizens of the village of Karzan at the\nthird hour before dawn in the second period after his arrival.\nDesecration of the Temple of our beloved Goddess Zermat, Queen of the\nHarvest. Conspiracy with the lesser gods to cause the unprecedented\ndrought in the Dermatti section of our fair globe. Obscene exposure of\nhis pouch-marks in a public square. Four separate and distinct charges\nof jail-break and bribery--\" The judge pounded the bench for\norder--\"Espionage with the accursed scum of Altair II in preparation for\ninterplanetary invasion.\"\n\nThe little con-man's jaw sagged lower and lower, the color draining from\nhis face. He turned, wide-eyed, to Meyerhoff, then back to the judge.\n\n\"The Chairman of the Jury,\" said the Judge succinctly, \"will read the\nverdict.\"\n\nThe little native in the front of the jury-box popped up like a puppet\non a string. \"Defendant found guilty on all counts,\" he said.\n\n\"Defendant is guilty! The court will pronounce sentence--\"\n\n\"_Now wait a minute!_\" Zeckler was on his feet, wild-eyed. \"What kind of\nrailroad job--\"\n\nThe judge blinked disappointedly at Paul Meyerhoff. \"Not yet?\" he asked,\nunhappily.\n\n\"No.\" Meyerhoff's hands twitched nervously. \"Not yet, Your Honor. Later,\nYour Honor. The trial comes _first_.\"\n\nThe judge looked as if his candy had been stolen. \"But you _said_ I\nshould call for the verdict.\"\n\n\"Later. You have to have the trial before you can have the verdict.\"\n\nThe Altairian shrugged indifferently. \"Now--later--\" he muttered.\n\n\"Have the prosecutor call his first witness,\" said Meyerhoff.\n\nZeckler leaned over, his face ashen. \"These charges,\" he whispered.\n\"They're insane!\"\n\n\"Of course they are,\" Meyerhoff whispered back.\n\n\"But what am I going to--\"\n\n\"Sit tight. Let _them_ set things up.\"\n\n\"But those _lies_. They're liars, the whole pack of them--\" He broke off\nas the prosecutor roared a name.\n\nThe shaggy brute who took the stand was wearing a bright purple hat\nwhich sat rakishly over one ear. He grinned the Altairian equivalent of\na hungry grin at the prosecutor. Then he cleared his throat and started.\n\"This Terran riffraff--\"\n\n\"The oath,\" muttered the judge. \"We've got to have the oath.\"\n\nThe prosecutor nodded, and four natives moved forward, carrying huge\ninscribed marble slabs to the front of the court. One by one the chunks\nwere reverently piled in a heap at the witness's feet. The witness\nplaced a huge, hairy paw on the cairn, and the prosecutor said, \"Do you\nswear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so\nhelp you--\" he paused to squint at the paper in his hand, and finished\non a puzzled note, \"--Goddess?\"\n\nThe witness removed the paw from the rock pile long enough to scratch\nhis ear. Then he replaced it, and replied, \"Of course,\" in an injured\ntone.\n\n\"Then tell this court what you have seen of the activities of this\nabominable wretch.\"\n\nThe witness settled back into the chair, fixing one eye on Zeckler's\nface, another on the prosecutor, and closing the third as if in\nmeditation. \"I think it happened on the fourth night of the seventh\ncrossing of Altair II (may the Goddess cast a drought upon it)--or was\nit the seventh night of the fourth crossing?--\" he grinned\napologetically at the judge--\"when I was making my way back through town\ntoward my blessed land-plot, minding my own business, Your Honor, after\nweeks of bargaining for the crop I was harvesting. Suddenly from the\nshadow of the building, this creature--\" he waved a paw at\nZeckler--\"stopped me in my tracks with a vicious cry. He had a weapon\nI'd never seen before, and before I could find my voice he forced me\nback against the wall. I could see by the cruel glint in his eyes that\nthere was no warmth, no sympathy in his heart, that I was--\"\n\n\"Objection!\" Zeckler squealed plaintively, jumping to his feet. \"This\nwitness can't even remember what night he's talking about!\"\n\nThe judge looked startled. Then he pawed feverishly through his bundle\nof notes. \"Overruled,\" he said abruptly. \"Continue, please.\"\n\nThe witness glowered at Zeckler. \"As I was saying before this loutish\ninterruption,\" he muttered, \"I could see that I was face to face with\nthe most desperate of criminal types, even for Terrans. Note the shape\nof his head, the flabbiness of his ears. I was petrified with fear. And\nthen, helpless as I was, this two-legged abomination began to shower me\nwith threats of evil to my blessed home, dark threats of poisoning my\nland unless I would tell him where he could find the resting place of\nour blessed Goddess--\"\n\n\"I never saw him before in my life,\" Zeckler moaned to Meyerhoff.\n\"Listen to him! Why should I care where their Goddess--\"\n\nMeyerhoff gave him a stony look. \"The Goddess runs things around here.\nShe makes it rain. If it doesn't rain, somebody's insulted her. It's\nvery simple.\"\n\n\"But how can I fight testimony like that?\"\n\n\"I doubt if you _can_ fight it.\"\n\n\"But they can't prove a word of it--\" He looked at the jury, who were\nlistening enraptured to the second witness on the stand. This one was\ntestifying regarding the butcherous slaughter of eighteen (or was it\ntwenty-three? Oh, yes, twenty-three) women and children in the suburban\nvillage of Karzan. The pogrom, it seemed, had been accomplished by an\nenergy weapon which ate great, gaping holes in the sides of buildings. A\nthird witness took the stand, continuing the drone as the room grew\nhotter and muggier. Zeckler grew paler and paler, his eyes turning\nglassy as the testimony piled up. \"But it's not _true_,\" he whispered to\nMeyerhoff.\n\n\"Of course it isn't! Can't you understand? _These people have no regard\nfor truth._ It's stupid, to them, silly, a mark of low intelligence. The\nonly thing in the world they have any respect for is a liar bigger and\nmore skillful than they are.\"\n\nZeckler jerked around abruptly as he heard his name bellowed out. \"Does\nthe defendant have anything to say before the jury delivers the\nverdict?\"\n\n\"Do I have--\" Zeckler was across the room in a flash, his pale cheeks\nsuddenly taking on a feverish glow. He sat down gingerly on the witness\nchair, facing the judge, his eyes bright with fear and excitement.\n\"Your--Your Honor, I--I have a statement to make which will have a most\nimportant bearing on this case. You must listen with the greatest care.\"\nHe glanced quickly at Meyerhoff, and back to the judge. \"Your Honor,\" he\nsaid in a hushed voice. \"You are in gravest of danger. All of you. Your\nlives--your very land is at stake.\"\n\nThe judge blinked, and shuffled through his notes hurriedly as a murmur\narose in the court. \"Our land?\"\n\n\"Your lives, your land, everything you hold dear,\" Zeckler said quickly,\nlicking his lips nervously. \"You must try to understand me--\" he glanced\napprehensively over his shoulder \"now, because I may not live long\nenough to repeat what I am about to tell you--\"\n\nThe murmur quieted down, all ears straining in their headsets to hear\nhis words. \"These charges,\" he continued, \"all of them--they're\nperfectly true. At least, they _seem_ to be perfectly true. But in every\ninstance, I was working with heart and soul, risking my life, for the\nwelfare of your beautiful planet.\"\n\nThere was a loud hiss from the back of the court. Zeckler frowned and\nrubbed his hands together. \"It was my misfortune,\" he said, \"to go to\nthe wrong planet when I first came to Altair from my homeland on Terra.\nI--I landed on Altair II, a grave mistake, but as it turned out, a very\nfortunate error. Because in attempting to arrange trading in that\nfrightful place, I made certain contacts.\" His voice trembled, and sank\nlower. \"I learned the horrible thing which is about to happen to this\nplanet, at the hands of those barbarians. The conspiracy is theirs, not\nmine. They have bribed your Goddess, flattered her and lied to her,\ncoerced her all-powerful goodness to their own evil interests, preparing\nfor the day when they could persuade her to cast your land into the\nfiery furnace of a ten-year-drought--\"\n\nSomebody in the middle of the court burst out laughing. One by one the\nnatives nudged one another, and booed, and guffawed, until the rising\ntide of racket drowned out Zeckler's words. \"The defendant is obviously\nlying,\" roared the prosecutor over the pandemonium. \"Any fool knows that\nthe Goddess can't be bribed. How could she be a Goddess if she could?\"\n\nZeckler grew paler. \"But--perhaps they were very clever--\"\n\n\"And how could they flatter her, when she knows, beyond doubt, that she\nis the most exquisitely radiant creature in all the Universe? And _you_\ndare to insult her, drag her name in the dirt.\"\n\nThe hisses grew louder, more belligerent. Cries of \"Butcher him!\" and\n\"Scald his bowels!\" rose from the courtroom. The judge banged for\nsilence, his eyes angry.\n\n\"Unless the defendant wishes to take up more of our precious time with\nthese ridiculous lies, the jury--\"\n\n\"Wait! Your Honor, I request a short recess before I present my final\nplea.\"\n\n\"Recess?\"\n\n\"A few moments to collect my thoughts, to arrange my case.\"\n\nThe judge settled back with a disgusted snarl. \"Do I have to?\" he asked\nMeyerhoff.\n\nMeyerhoff nodded. The judge shrugged, pointing over his shoulder to the\nanteroom. \"You can go in there,\" he said.\n\nSomehow, Zeckler managed to stumble from the witness stand, amid riotous\nboos and hisses, and tottered into the anteroom.\n\n\n\nZeckler puffed hungrily on a cigarette, and looked up at Meyerhoff with\nhaunted eyes. \"It--it doesn't look so good,\" he muttered.\n\nMeyerhoff's eyes were worried, too. For some reason, he felt a surge of\npity and admiration for the haggard con-man. \"It's worse than I'd\nanticipated,\" he admitted glumly. \"That was a good try, but you just\ndon't know enough about them and their Goddess.\" He sat down wearily. \"I\ndon't see what you can do. They want your blood, and they're going to\nhave it. They just won't believe you, no matter _how_ big a lie you\ntell.\"\n\nZeckler sat in silence for a moment. \"This lying business,\" he said\nfinally, \"exactly how does it work?\"\n\n\"The biggest, most convincing liar wins. It's as simple as that. It\ndoesn't matter how outlandish a whopper you tell. Unless, of course,\nthey've made up their minds that you just naturally aren't as big a liar\nas they are. And it looks like that's just what they've done. It\nwouldn't make any difference to them _what_ you say--unless, somehow,\nyou could _make_ them believe it.\"\n\nZeckler frowned. \"And how do they regard the--the biggest liar? I mean,\nhow do they feel toward him?\"\n\nMeyerhoff shifted uneasily. \"It's hard to say. It's been my experience\nthat they respect him highly--maybe even fear him a little. After all,\nthe most convincing liar always wins in any transaction, so he gets more\nland, more food, more power. Yes, I think the biggest liar could go\nwhere he pleased without any interference.\"\n\nZeckler was on his feet, his eyes suddenly bright with excitement. \"Wait\na minute,\" he said tensely. \"To tell them a lie that they'd have to\nbelieve--a lie they simply couldn't _help_ but believe--\" He turned on\nMeyerhoff, his hands trembling. \"Do they _think_ the way we do? I mean,\nwith logic, cause and effect, examining evidence and drawing\nconclusions? Given certain evidence, would they have to draw the same\nconclusions that we have to draw?\"\n\nMeyerhoff blinked. \"Well--yes. Oh, yes, they're perfectly logical.\"\n\nZeckler's eyes flashed, and a huge grin broke out on his sallow face.\nHis thin body fairly shook. He started hopping up and down on one foot,\nstaring idiotically into space. \"If I could only think--\" he muttered.\n\"Somebody--somewhere--something I read.\"\n\n\"Whatever are you talking about?\"\n\n\"It was a Greek, I think--\"\n\nMeyerhoff stared at him. \"Oh, come now. Have you gone off your rocker\ncompletely? You've got a problem on your hands, man.\"\n\n\"No, no, I've got a problem in the bag!\" Zeckler's cheeks flushed.\n\"Let's go back in there--I think I've got an answer!\"\n\nThe courtroom quieted the moment they opened the door, and the judge\nbanged the gavel for silence. As soon as Zeckler had taken his seat on\nthe witness stand, the judge turned to the head juryman. \"Now, then,\" he\nsaid with happy finality. \"The jury--\"\n\n\"Hold on! Just one minute more.\"\n\nThe judge stared down at Zeckler as if he were a bug on a rock. \"Oh,\nyes. You had something else to say. Well, go ahead and say it.\"\n\nZeckler looked sharply around the hushed room. \"You want to convict me,\"\nhe said softly, \"in the worst sort of way. Isn't that right?\"\n\nEyes swung toward him. The judge broke into an evil grin. \"That's\nright.\"\n\n\"But you can't really convict me until you've considered carefully any\nstatement I make in my own defense. Isn't that right?\"\n\nThe judge looked uncomfortable. \"If you've got something to say, go\nahead and say it.\"\n\n\"I've got just one statement to make. Short and sweet. But you'd better\nlisten to it, and think it out carefully before you decide that you\nreally want to convict me.\" He paused, and glanced slyly at the judge.\n\"You don't think much of those who tell the truth, it seems. Well, put\n_this_ statement in your record, then.\" His voice was loud and clear in\nthe still room. \"_All Earthmen are absolutely incapable of telling the\ntruth._\"\n\nPuzzled frowns appeared on the jury's faces. One or two exchanged\nstartled glances, and the room was still as death. The judge stared at\nhim, and then at Meyerhoff, then back. \"But you\"--he stammered.\n\"You're\"--He stopped in mid-sentence, his jaw sagging.\n\nOne of the jurymen let out a little squeak, and fainted dead away. It\ntook, all in all, about ten seconds for the statement to soak in.\n\nAnd then pandemonium broke loose in the courtroom.\n\n\n\n\"Really,\" said Harry Zeckler loftily, \"it was so obvious I'm amazed that\nit didn't occur to me first thing.\" He settled himself down comfortably\nin the control cabin of the Interplanetary Rocket and grinned at the\noutline of Altair IV looming larger in the view screen.\n\nPaul Meyerhoff stared stonily at the controls, his lips compressed\nangrily. \"You might at least have told me what you were planning.\"\n\n\"And take the chance of being overheard? Don't be silly. It had to come\nas a bombshell. I had to establish myself as a liar--the prize liar of\nthem all, but I had to tell the sort of lie that they simply could not\ncope with. Something that would throw them into such utter confusion\nthat they wouldn't _dare_ convict me.\" He grinned impishly at Meyerhoff.\n\"The paradox of Epimenides the Cretan. It really stopped them cold. They\n_knew_ I was an Earthmen, which meant that my statement that Earthmen\nwere liars was a lie, which meant that maybe I wasn't a liar, in which\ncase--oh, it was tailor-made.\"\n\n\"It sure was.\" Meyerhoff's voice was a snarl.\n\n\"Well, it made me out a liar in a class they couldn't approach, didn't\nit?\"\n\nMeyerhoff's face was purple with anger. \"Oh, indeed it did! And it put\n_all_ Earthmen in exactly the same class, too.\"\n\n\"So what's honor among thieves? I got off, didn't I?\"\n\nMeyerhoff turned on him fiercely. \"Oh, you got off just fine. You scared\nthe living daylights out of them. And in an eon of lying they never have\nrun up against a short-circuit like that. You've also completely botched\nany hope of ever setting up a trading alliance with Altair I, and that\nincludes uranium, too. Smart people don't gamble with loaded dice. You\nscared them so badly they don't want anything to do with us.\"\n\nZeckler's grin broadened, and he leaned back luxuriously. \"Ah, well.\nAfter all, the Trading Alliance was _your_ outlook, wasn't it? What a\npity!\" He clucked his tongue sadly. \"Me, I've got a fortune in credits\nsitting back at the consulate waiting for me--enough to keep me on silk\nfor quite a while, I might say. I think I'll just take a nice, long\nvacation.\"\n\nMeyerhoff turned to him, and a twinkle of malignant glee appeared in his\neyes. \"Yes, I think you will. I'm quite sure of it, in fact. Won't cost\nyou a cent, either.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\nMeyerhoff grinned unpleasantly. He brushed an imaginary lint fleck from\nhis lapel, and looked up at Zeckler slyly. \"That--uh--jury trial. The\nAltairians weren't any too happy to oblige. They wanted to execute you\noutright. Thought a trial was awfully silly--until they got their money\nback, of course. Not too much--just three million credits.\"\n\nZeckler went white. \"But that money was in banking custody!\"\n\n\"Is that right? My goodness. You don't suppose they could have lost\nthose papers, do you?\" Meyerhoff grinned at the little con-man. \"And\nincidentally, you're under arrest, you know.\"\n\nA choking sound came from Zeckler's throat. \"_Arrest!_\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. Didn't I tell you? Conspiring to undermine the authority of\nthe Terran Trading Commission. Serious charge, you know. Yes, I think\nwe'll take a nice long vacation together, straight back to Terra. And\nthere I think you'll face a jury trial.\"\n\nZeckler spluttered. \"There's no evidence--you've got nothing on me! What\nkind of a frame are you trying to pull?\"\n\n\"A _lovely_ frame. Airtight. A frame from the bottom up, and you're\nright square in the middle. And this time--\" Meyerhoff tapped a\ncigarette on his thumb with happy finality--\"this time I _don't_ think\nyou'll get off.\"\n\n",
