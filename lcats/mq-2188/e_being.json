    "body": "First man to reach the speed of light, I was. But you'll find the good\nAlbert only hinted at the effects, in a delta-theta 2.3 pi-squared\nway. E=mc^2, he said. And for fifty years before they built my rocket,\nthe _Lighttrick_, slim, tapering, sleek and gy-perpowered, everyone\nconcentrated on turning matter into energy at a light-squared power.\nBig, bright bangs, and congratulations.\n\nIt's a pity no one asked what happens to energy _divided_ by the speed\nof light. I happen to be the answer to the equation, and by interfering\nwith the motor of this electric typescripter I can give you my thoughts\non the matter.\n\nThe _Lighttrick_ hit full velocity out there between Van Allen and the\nasteroids. I'd guess the whole beautiful ship, including me, converted\ninto energy and, slowing down, reconverted on the wrong side, so to\nspeak. And there I was, floating without a ship and surrounded by\nlittle round beings, shimmering in a blue haze.\n\n\"Good afternoon,\" I said.\n\nBut no sound came out of my mouth. I had a mouth, in a way, but not for\ntalking; and not at all the sort of mouth I used to have. In fact, the\nshimmering blue haze was me. I could find no other parts of me. And\nwhen the little round things touched me on the periphery, there was an\nintelligent vibration.\n\n\"Frequency and tone?\" said the vibration. \"Please identify.\"\n\n\"You must take me as you find me,\" I thought.\n\n\"Unidentified frequencies and discordant tones requested not to wander\nin spaceways,\" vibrated the little round things.\n\n\"I'm a man,\" I vibrated back. \"We don't have frequencies. We _use_\nfrequencies in radio, television, radar and so on.\"\n\n\"Not intelligible.\"\n\n\"Where's my ship?\"\n\n\"Ship?\"\n\nI tried to picture the _Lighttrick_ and the long thin gleam on her\nhull, the fury of her rockets and the calm ordered keyboard of the\ncontrol panels.\n\n\"Most interesting,\" vibrated the round things. \"Poetic. Very creative.\nSpeculative philosopher, yes?\"\n\n\n\nThey seemed to be grasping the general idea, so I concentrated on an\nimage of myself, square and bearded, staring sternly into space through\nthe ports, in a pioneer manner, observing hitherto unknown planets.\n\n\"Most ingenious,\" my audience vibrated back. \"But unlikely.\"\n\nThen they started vibrating among themselves.\n\n\"Senior e minus says....\"\n\n\"Mush is mush, that's what I say.\"\n\n\"Now, theoretically....\"\n\n\"I don't vibrate why not. There are more things in positive and\nnegative, Horatio, than....\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" I vibrated.\n\nThere was a brief pause.\n\n\"Perhaps we should illuminate.\"\n\n\"Please do,\" I vibrated politely.\n\nThey gathered round the edges of my haze and explained. It seemed\na very senior e had suggested once that there might, just might,\ntheoretically be side-effects of mush. The little round things were e\nbeings. And \"mush\" was the accepted term for the static and orbital\ntracks of electrons in fixed patterns, such as one found here and there\nin space. But the very senior e, apparently, had speculated that in\na certain narrow band of light frequencies mush might possibly give\nan appearance of \"matter\"--to coin a word--a kind of condensed or\ncrystalline energy.\n\n\"But no one,\" they vibrated, \"ever suggested there might be forms of\nlife based on such 'material' structures. We admire your imagination.\nHail bright e! All hail.\"\n\nA rapid circuit of my haze failed to show anyone else that they might\nbe vibrating to.\n\n\"Do you mean me?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Naturally. Hail, bright e!\"\n\n\"I'm an e?\"\n\n\"What else?\"\n\n\"Very well,\" I thought. \"Perhaps you'll tell me what an e is.\"\n\n\"An e? We are all e beings.\"\n\n\"So you mentioned earlier. But what is an e being?\"\n\n\"Ah, you are too deep for us. Highly original philosopher, yes. But\nplease get off the spaceway. There is a food flood due.\"\n\nAnd they edged me firmly down, and down, to a vast doughnut with a hole\nin the center.\n\nI ate a piece out of habit. It was insipid and tasteless. But then, a\ndoughnut several thousand miles across must have some drawbacks.\n\n\"The pasture is better inside,\" they vibrated.\n\nSo I sank down into the enormous piece of pastry and came out of\na couple of inner layers to see a big ball of mush. There was no\nmistaking it. A vast, tangled, interconnecting mass of tiny points of\nlight. Mush was a good name for it. But here and there on its surface\nwere great rivers of liquor and mounds of food in delectable variety.\n\nI stuffed myself for days, browsing here and there across the surface\nof the globe of mush.\n\nIn fact, I was chewing quietly on an apparently endless streaming\nribbon of--well--trout, steak, caviar, you-name-your-favorite food;\nthat's what it was to me. And I happened to bite too deeply. There was\na core of this mush stuff inside and, when I bit it, the whole food\nsupply stopped. The stream of entrancing food just disappeared.\n\nAnd there I was, hovering on a plain of bare mush.\n\n\n\nI was brooding on this and belching contentedly with a sort of cracking\nnoise, when the skeleton came driving over the surface of the mush\nball. It was in a framework of mush shaped like a jeep but squirting\ndelicious little fountains of liquor in the front, where the engine\nof a real jeep would have been. I moved over and tasted them. And the\nwhole framework stopped.\n\n\"Triple purple hell,\" said a voice. \"The damned thing's broken down\nagain. Wait till I get my hands on that idiot mechanic!\"\n\n\"Hey,\" I vibrated. \"Where are you?\"\n\n\"Now I'll have to walk all the way back, I suppose,\" the voice added.\n\nThe skeleton got out of the mush jeep, walked through me and lifted the\nhood.\n\n\"Battery flat,\" the voice said disgustedly. \"Not a drop of juice in it.\"\n\nI began to feel guilty.\n\nThere was a slight blue haze round the skeleton's head. When I examined\nit more closely, it looked less like a skeleton of bare bones and more\nlike a physician's chart of the human nervous system, traced out in\nthin lines of mush ... little close-packed lines of energy, fixed in\nrelation to each other but flexible as a whole.\n\nIt occurred to me I was looking at a human being, in terms of energy.\n\nAnd I had just drunk his jeep's ignition!\n\nSo thought was a form of energy, after all. For some of the things\nhe was thinking about the mechanic responsible for maintaining the\njeep were strictly subliminal and Freudian. If he spoke, I doubted if\nI would hear him. His voice would just be a very faint wave of mush\ntraveling indistinctly out.\n\n\"And the next time that spark-spark foreman sends me out on an\nemergency power-line repair,\" continued the skeleton, \"he can\nspark-spark well give me a vehicle that _works_!\"\n\nThe skeleton's name was Joe, I think. And I watched Joe sway over to\nthe ribbon of mush I had bitten through.\n\n\"Fused,\" Joe muttered in his head. \"Now, what on Earth did that?\"\n\nAnd it struck me for the first time where I was. Back on Earth! As\nan e being! A being based, it seemed, on energy and not on matter.\nConverted accidentally by the marvels of modern science and the supreme\ntechnological achievement of traveling at the speed of light.\n\nI spat disgustedly at the thought.\n\n\"Summer lightning?\" Joe bent his mush head back and looked up. He\nexposed a rather interesting tidbit in the region of his throat plexus\nand his cardiac nerves were, I regret to say, for an instant very\nappetizing. But I controlled myself.\n\nAfter all, in a technological society as free with energy as ours ...\nas yours ... there were bound to be ample food and drink flowing about.\n\nI swear I had come to that ethical conclusion. It wasn't my fault that\nI was unfamiliar with my own reactions as an e being. I didn't know I\nwas so fast. I ate Joe by mistake. I just drained off the energy of his\nsystem before I knew it. Truly.\n\n\n\nWell, naturally I was sorry about it. In fact, I was just standing\nthere, looking at the huddled pile of mush, when the other repair crew\narrived. From their scrambled thoughts of death and radio and Main\nOffice, I gathered they were sending for a doctor. Sure enough, he\narrived in an autojet with delicious after-burners.\n\nSo then they had to send for a team of towing tractors. I just\ncouldn't help thinking about the ignition systems of their vehicles;\nand to think is to eat, with an e. Or rather, if you have the speed\nof light--as an e being has--it takes some time before you learn to\ncontrol your reactions quickly enough.\n\n\"Well, I don't know what's going on around here,\" said a voice which I\nlocated as the doctor thinking to himself. \"But I remember Professor\nBigglesby's advice. When you don't know, nod thoughtfully.\"\n\nI could see his mush head and its blue haze wobbling solemnly at the\nother mush-men. I beg your pardon--at the other humans.\n\n\"Nervous collapse,\" the doctor continued in his head. \"Something to\ndo with electricity, I suppose. Powerline failure. Broken cable. Dead\nrepair man. Don't know much about electricity. Who does? Hello, hello,\nwhat's this?\"\n\nI saw him bend his nervous skeleton over Joe's body and straighten up\nwith a string of little silver beads sticking to his hand.\n\n\"Makes a noise. Quite musical. Adheres to skin. Light. What is it?\"\n\n\"There's some more of that stuff in the jeep engine,\" one of the repair\ncrew noticed.\n\n\"And on the doc's jets....\"\n\n\"And in our truck....\"\n\nI watched and gathered I was leaving some form of conversion product\naround the place. I didn't like that thought. If an e being eats energy\nas food and drink, what does an e being's conversion product make? The\nanswer might be important ... considering I had just eaten someone.\n\nI decided to follow along. The doctor was wiping the silver beads off\nhis hands into something shaped like a glass jar and screwing on a lid.\nI thought I had better be around when it was examined.\n\nSo I rolled after the towing tractors and carefully refrained from even\nthinking of their refreshing little spark-plugs and tasty exhaust.\n\n\n\nI followed the doctor until we reached a place where the mush grew up\nin blocks on either side, square and close-meshed, with streams, rivers\nand trickling lines of energy tumbling through their structures. I\ngathered we had reached a city of some sort.\n\nThe doctor-skeleton got out of the tractor and went into one of the\ntall blocks of mush through a hole. I followed, nibbling a light bulb\nor two as we passed down the long corridor inside. The doctor, still\ncarrying the jar shape, stopped once or twice and looked back, then he\nshot in through a doorway on the left.\n\n\"Dr. McPherson,\" thought a thin skeleton by the window.\n\n\"I don't want to say it,\" said the doctor's mush head, \"but this jar of\nmuck seems to have put the corridor lights out.\"\n\nHe held out the jar and I saw a faint wave of mush spreading from his\nmouth toward the thin skeleton. When the mush wave reached him, the\nthin man jerked in plain disbelief.\n\n\"If I heard that straight, either Doc McPherson is drunk or he's got\nsomething very interesting. I wonder which.\"\n\nThe thin man wandered casually over to the jar the doctor was holding\nand took it.\n\n\"Not drunk,\" he considered, holding the jar up in the air. \"But....\"\n\nAnd then his thoughts ran riot in a stream of edibles. He was thinking\nof electronics, protons, ions, electrons, gamma, delta and alpha\nparticles, and I couldn't resist it. I'm sorry. I just had to eat him,\nhis thoughts were so delicious.\n\nDoctor McPherson stared down at the thin body on the floor and walked\nout of the room. He left the jar where it had rolled on the floor of\nmush.\n\nI was quite happy. It must have been a laboratory of some sort. There\nwere refreshing sources all over the room.\n\nI was still tasting and testing here and there when the doctor returned\nwith another pair of mush-men--humans, I mean--and they had a long\nconversation in their heads about the late scientist and the contents\nof the jar. Finally, they picked up the jar with a long rod of static\nenergy--some metal, I suppose. They took it away.\n\nUnfortunately, this time it seems I had eaten a physicist working for\nthe government. More and more mush shapes of humans clustered round\nDoctor McPherson, and one came hurrying up from another laboratory.\n\n\"Raw ozone,\" he thought as he came. \"This fellow needs watching.\nCouldn't get ozone like that except in space. And now he happens to be\naround when we lose our top physicist. And that's the second accident\nof the day. Yes, _sir_, this McPherson needs watching! You can never\ntell where sabotage will break out.\"\n\nHe grasped the doctor's arm and said something in a faint wave of mush\nthat I could not see clearly enough to understand.\n\n\"Me? Ridiculous! I was just....\" thought McPherson. But he shrugged and\nturned away.\n\nWell, I couldn't leave him in a mess like that, so I followed Doctor\nMcPherson home.\n\nI had to explain. But how?\n\nAnd there was the problem. How can a being based on energy, like me,\ncommunicate with a being based on matter, like him?\n\nObviously, I had to signal in some way, give some signs of life that\nwould be intelligible to him.\n\nHe was sitting in a chair-shape of strand energy interwoven together,\nand he was thinking gloomy thoughts. He flicked on the televiewer. And\nthere was the answer.\n\n\n\nI found the input flow, followed it into the cathode tube and ate the\npictures off the screen in a discriminating manner.\n\nThey were too small and scattered to make a mouthful, but that wasn't\nthe point. I was able to signal to him! I ate pieces of the picture\ncoming through and left regular black holes on the tube face, dot,\ndash, dash-dash-dot.\n\nDoctor McPherson stood up, approached the set, reached in his pocket\nfor a bottle and took two pills. And then he switched off the set and\nwent to bed.\n\n\"Now my eyes are playing up. Liver,\" his thoughts trailed away.\n\nAfter awhile, I saw a better answer. One man would be scared to do\nanything even if I did get in touch with him. What I needed was a\nlarger scale. If several dozen mush ... several dozen people started\nspeculating about me, they would lend each other moral support and they\nwould start looking for my signs. Then I could tell them all about the\nlittle error of appetite.\n\nSo I went back down the main power line from Doctor McPherson's\nhome--high grade, pure liquor in that line!--and tracked it upstream to\nthe city power house. But when I took a deep bite, all the generators\nstopped and an auxiliary circuit from somewhere else started up.\n\nI ate a piece of main coil in disgust.\n\nWell, that was no use. And then I remembered the little e beings'\ncomments on a food flood due in the spaceway. A sunburst, no doubt. A\nmagnetic storm on the sun would certainly send a harvest out through\nspace for e beings. But it would louse up the planetary radio system.\n\nAnd there I had an answer. All I had to do was remove the radio\ninterference in a planned way and every receiver on half the world\nwould receive my signals. How easy it was!\n\nSo I went back up to the first layer of the doughnut round the Earth\nwhere there was a field of fresh energy. As the food came flooding in\nfrom the sun I gobbled it up. Mouthful. Pause. Mouthful, mouthful.\nPause. Mouthful, mouthful, mouthful. Pause.\n\nI worked up and down the numbers in progression, swallowing every lump\nof solar radiation within reach.\n\nBut I guess I was carried away by the enjoyable eating. A lot more time\npassed than I had intended; and when I came down again to read a few\nthoughts, the world was freezing in parts, and the sea was boiling in\nothers, and the mush lay flat as a desert in wide patches.\n\nI worked it out, eventually. No energy means no evaporation, thus no\nclouds and no rain for vegetation. And that means no carbon dioxide\nlayer to protect the planet, in turn leading to excessive radiation\nwhen I stopped eating, hence deserts and a boiling ocean and parts of\nthe land frozen solid.\n\nNot a very good message.\n\n\n\nWell, I cleaned up as best I could, but it was drudgery sipping up\nthe dull, flat-tasting thermal energy of the oceans. Tidal forces and\nmagnetic flows are stodgy, uninteresting diets. You might as well eat\nstraight mush.\n\nI decided not to try that again. It had too many repercussions. What I\nwanted was a nice simple signal.\n\nA volcano would do excellently, I thought--Indian smoke signals on a\nvast scale.\n\nSo I hunted over the mush until I came to a reasonably active fountain,\nprobably Vesuvius but I'm not sure; one blob of mush looks like\nanother. And I drank the whole internal fire in bursts. Anyone with any\nsense could have seen the Morse-coded eruptions that I let go through.\n\nBut they didn't.\n\nThey missed my signals altogether. Chiefly because I had disturbed the\nbalance of stresses down at the foot of the volcano, deep in the mush,\nand when I came out it was dancing about in ripples and shakes. I don't\nsuppose many people would stop in the middle of an earthquake to note\nthe signals coming out of the local volcano. Anyway, no one did.\n\nAs you know, the damage was quite widespread. So I went round to the\nother side of the mush, where they were less distracted. What I needed\nwas a test-piece. Something which was already the focus of serious\nscientific interest. Something being carefully observed already.\n\nThe nuclear power plant in the nearest city mush-blocks seemed a\nreasonable choice. And good eating it made, too. Pure unadulterated\nflavor, strong and pulsing with vitality. I've never had a better meal.\n\nBut when I came out of the reactor and let it continue its food ...\nits energy production, all the humans had vanished. They hadn't seen\na thing. I found them miles away under the surface of the mush-level\nexpecting to be blown up. They assumed that when the pile ceased its\noutput it was building up internally, so they broadcast an emergency\nand took to their bunkers. And then they were busy for weeks correcting\nthe false alarm and dealing with complaints from freezer companies and\nhouseholders and utility commissions. So I left the area to sort itself\nout.\n\nVery well, I thought. This time, I'll choose a nuclear device that\n_is_ expected to explode and eat it before it does, while everyone is\nwatching.\n\nIt wasn't difficult to find. There was a long smear of food in the air\nall round the world, as if a lot of clumsy e eaters had dribbled. The\nmain source was easy to locate.\n\n\n\nI found a long stalk thing of mush and a mush shed on top and sat\nthere waiting. Eventually, a team of mushes hoisted up a device with\ndelicate little tidbit cores, and hurried away. So this was a fusion\nbomb, was it? I waited until it was triggered off, took a strong hold\nand ate the lot at the moment of burst.\n\nFor the record, swallowing a nuclear explosion is not very comfortable.\nI had indigestion for weeks. But I made it.\n\nIt was a waste of time.\n\nAs usual, I had overlooked something. The conversion was as massive\nas the energy I ate, and I found out what the silver beads Doctor\nMcPherson had put in the jar were. Energy eaten by e beings converts\ninto sound and ozone. And the conversion of the nuclear explosion sent\ngreat balls of sound rolling over the country, deafening the people,\nflattening structures by vibration, and releasing flows of raw ozone,\nwhich promptly started fires; and that in turn disturbed the cloud\nmasses and produced unprecedented floods.\n\nI was munching quietly on a power line, overlooking the great stretch\nof level mush of water up to and over the horizon, when Doctor\nMcPherson found me.\n\nA repair man drove him up, let him off the mush vehicle and drove off\nfast.\n\n\"You nutty old coot, you wanted to see the next breakdown and here it\nis,\" the repair man's thoughts shot away.\n\n\"I may be nuts,\" Doctor McPherson said to himself, standing underneath\nme, \"but I have an odd idea there's intelligent mischief behind all\nthis.\"\n\nHe sat on a rock-shaped mound of mush nearby.\n\n\"So here I am, following a idiotic hunch,\" he thought, and held out\na large jar with a most entrancing tidbit of radioactivity, cobalt\nflavor, in the bottom.\n\nNaturally, I went down happily and gobbled it up.\n\nAnd Doctor McPherson put the lid on. A lid of thick-meshed mush, leaden\nand inedible. It took me some time of fruitless revolving to discover I\nwas locked in a Leyden jar with a complicated series of non-conducting\nlayers.\n\nI'm starving.\n\n\n\nOh, he feeds me now and then, and the other day he put in a one-way\ncircuit so that I could operate this electric typescripter.\n\nBut he says I can't come out until war is declared and the Pentagon\nsignals him on emergency. Then he'll take the lid off and I can eat the\nnearest rocket heading this way. He's promised me that.\n\nHe needn't worry. I'm so hungry I'll eat the lot. But who wants to be a\nsecret air defense weapon locked in a Leyden jar?\n\nFellow e, keep away from this mush and these mush-men! They are\ndangerous.\n\nWhat's more, they have no finer feelings!",
