    "body": "Tom woke slowly, his mind groping back through the hypnosis. He found\nhimself looking toward the observation port, staring at stars and\nblackness.\n\n_The first man in space_, he thought bitterly.\n\nHe unstrapped himself from the acceleration seat, feeling a little\nwobbly in free fall.\n\n_The hypnotic trance idea worked, all right._\n\nThe last thing Tom remembered was Arnoldsson putting him under, here\nin the rocket's compartment, the old man's sad soft eyes and quiet\nvoice. Now 22,500 miles out, Tom was alone except for what Arnoldsson\nhad planted in his mind for post-hypnotic suggestion to recall. The\nhypnosis had helped him pull through the blastoff unhurt and even\nprotected him against the vertigo of weightlessness.\n\n_Yeah, it's a wonderful world_, Tom muttered acidly.\n\nHe got up from the seat cautiously, testing his coordination against\nzero gravity. His magnetic boots held to the deck satisfactorily.\n\nHe was lean and wiry, in his early forties, with a sharp angular face\nand dark, somber eyes. His hair had gone dead white years ago. He was\nencased up to his neck in a semi-flexible space suit; they had squirmed\nhim into it Earth-side because there was no room in the cramped cabin\nto put it on.\n\nTom glanced at the tiers of instrument consoles surrounding his\nseat--no blinking red lights, everything operating normally. _As if I\ncould do anything about it if they went wrong._ Then he leaned toward\nthe observation port, straining for a glimpse of the satellite.\n\nThe satellite.\n\nFive sealed packages floating within a three-hundred foot radius of\nemptiness, circling the Earth like a cluster of moonlets. Five pieces\nsent up in five robot rockets and placed in the same orbit, to wait for\na human intelligence to assemble them into a power-beaming satellite.\n\nFive pieces orbiting Earth for almost eighteen years; waiting for\nnearly eighteen years while down below men blasted themselves and their\ncities and their machines into atoms and forgot the satellite endlessly\ncircling, waiting for its creators to breathe life into it.\n\n_The hope of the world_, Tom thought. _And little Tommy Morris is\nsupposed to make it work ... and then fly home again._ He pushed\nhimself back into the seat. _Jason picked the wrong man._\n\n\n\n\"Tom! Tom, can you hear me?\"\n\nHe turned away from the port and flicked a switch on the radio console.\n\n\"Hello Ruth. I can hear you.\"\n\nA hubbub of excitement crackled through the radio receiver, then the\ngirl's voice: \"Are you all right? Is everything....\"\n\n\"Everything's fine,\" Tom said flatly. He could picture the scene back\nat the station--dozens of people clustered around the jury-rigged\nradio, Ruth working the controls, trying hard to stay calm when it was\nimpossible to, brushing back that permanently displaced wisp of brown\nhair that stubbornly fell over her forehead.\n\n\"Jason will be here in a minute,\" she said. \"He's in the tracking\nshack, helping to calculate your orbit.\"\n\n\n\n_Of course Jason will be here_, Tom thought. Aloud he said, \"He needn't\nbother. I can see the satellite packages; they're only a couple of\nhundred yards from the ship.\"\n\nEven through the radio he could sense the stir that went through them.\n\n_Don't get your hopes up_, he warned silently. _Remember, I'm no\nengineer. Engineers are too valuable to risk on this job. I'm just\na tool, a mindless screwdriver sent here to assemble this glorified\ntinkertoy. I'm the muscle, Arnoldsson is the nerve link, and Jason is\nthe brain._\n\nAbruptly, Jason's voice surged through the radio speaker, \"We did it,\nTom! We did it!\"\n\n_No_, Tom thought, _you did it, Jason. This is all your show._\n\n\"You should be able to see the satellite components,\" Jason said. His\nvoice was excited yet controlled, and his comment had a ring of command\nin it.\n\n\"I've already looked,\" Tom answered. \"I can see them.\"\n\n\"Are they damaged?\"\n\n\"Not as far as I can see. Of course, from this distance....\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" Jason said. \"You'd better get right outside and start\nworking on them. You've only got forty-eight hours worth of oxygen.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about me,\" Tom said into the radio. \"Just remember your\nend of the bargain.\"\n\n\"You'd better forget that until you get back here.\"\n\n\"I'm not forgetting anything.\"\n\n\"I mean you must concentrate on what you're doing up there if you\nexpect to get back alive.\"\n\n\"When I get back we're going to explore the bombed-out cities. You\npromised that. It's the only reason I agreed to this.\"\n\nJason's voice stiffened. \"My memory is quite as good as yours. We'll\ndiscuss the expedition after you return. Now you're using up valuable\ntime ... and oxygen.\"\n\n\"Okay. I'm going outside.\"\n\nRuth's voice came back on: \"Tom, remember to keep the ship's radio\nopen, or else your suit radio won't be able to reach us. And we're all\nhere ... Dr. Arnoldsson, Jason, the engineers ... if anything comes up,\nwe'll be right here to help you.\"\n\n\n\nTom grinned mirthlessly. _Right here: 22,500 miles away._\n\n\"Tom?\"\n\n\"Yes Ruth.\"\n\n\"Good luck,\" she said. \"From all of us.\"\n\n_Even Jason?_ he wanted to ask, but instead said merely, \"Thanks.\"\n\nHe fitted the cumbersome helmet over his head and sealed it to the\njoints on his suit. A touch of a button on the control panel pumped\nthe compartment's air into storage cylinders. Then Tom stood up and\nunlocked the hatch directly over his seat.\n\nReaching for the handholds just outside the hatch, he pulled himself\nthrough, and after a weightless comic ballet managed to plant his\nmagnetized boots on the skin of the ship. Then, standing, he looked\nout at the universe.\n\nOddly, he felt none of the overpowering emotion he had once expected\nof this moment. Grandeur, terror, awe--no, he was strangely calm.\nThe stars were only points of light on a dead-black background; the\nEarth was a fat crescent patched with colors; the sun, through his\nheavily-tinted visor, was like the pictures he had seen at planetarium\nshows, years ago.\n\nAs he secured a lifeline to the grip beside the hatch, Tom thought that\nhe felt as though someone had stuck a reverse hypodermic into him and\ndrained away all his emotions.\n\nOnly then did he realize what had happened. Jason, the engineer,\nthe leader, the man who thought of everything, had made Arnoldsson\ncondition his mind for this. No gaping at the universe for the first\nman in space, too much of a chance to take! There's a job to be done\nand no time for human frailty or sentiment.\n\n_Not even that_, Tom said to himself. _He wouldn't even allow me one\nmoment of human emotion._\n\nBut as he pushed away from the ship and floated ghost-like toward the\nlargest of the satellite packages, Tom twisted around for another look\nat Earth.\n\n_I wonder if she looked that way before the war?_\n\n\n\nSlowly, painfully, men had attempted to rebuild their civilization\nafter the war had exhausted itself. But of all the things destroyed by\nthe bombs and plagues, the most agonizing loss was man's sources of\nenergy.\n\nThe coal mines, the oil refineries, the electricity-generating plants,\nthe nuclear power piles ... all shattered into radioactive rubble.\nThere could be no return to any kind of organized society while men\nhad to scavenge for wood to warm themselves and to run their primitive\nmachines.\n\nThen someone had remembered the satellite.\n\nIt had been designed, before the war, to collect solar energy and beam\nit to a receiving station on Earth. The satellite packages had been\nfired into a 24-hour orbit, circling the Earth over a fixed point on\nthe Equator. The receiving station, built on the southeastern coast\nof the United States, saw the five units as a single second-magnitude\nstar, low on the horizon all year, every year.\n\nOf course the packages wavered slightly in their orbits, but not enough\nin eighteen years to spread very far apart. A man could still put them\ntogether into a power-beaming satellite.\n\nIf he could get there.\n\nAnd if they were not damaged.\n\nAnd if he knew how to put them together.\n\nThrough months that stretched into years, over miles of radioactive\nwilderness, on horseback, on carts, on foot, those who knew about the\nsatellite spread the word, carefully, secretly, to what was left of\nNorth America's scientists and engineers. Gradually they trickled into\nthe once-abandoned settlement.\n\nThey elected a leader: Jason, the engineer, one of the few men who knew\nanything about rockets to survive the war and the lunatic bands that\nhunted down anyone suspected of being connected with pre-war science.\n\nJason's first act was to post guards around the settlement. Then he\norganized the work of rebuilding the power-receiving station and a\nman-carrying rocket.\n\nThey pieced together parts of a rocket and equipment that had been\ndamaged by the war. What they did not know, they learned. What they\ndid not have, they built or cannibalized from ruined equipment.\n\nJason sent armed foragers out for gasoline, charcoal and wood. They\nbuilt a ramshackle electricity generator. They planted crops and hunted\nthe small game in the local underbrush. A major celebration occurred\nwhenever a forager came back towing a stray cow or horse or goat.\n\nThey erected fences around the settlement, because more than once they\nhad to fight off the small armies of looters and anti-scientists that\nstill roved the countryside.\n\nBut finally they completed the rocket ... after exhausting almost every\nscrap of material and every ounce of willpower.\n\nThen they picked a pilot: Thomas H. Morris, age 41, former historian\nand teacher. He had arrived a year before the completion of the rocket\nafter walking 1,300 miles to find the settlement; his purpose was to\norganize some of the scientists and explore the bombed-out cities to\nsee what could be salvaged out of man's shattered heritage.\n\nBut Tom was ideal for the satellite job: the right size--five-six and\none-hundred thirty pounds; no dependents--wife and two sons dead of\nradiation sickness. True, he had no technical background whatsoever;\nbut with Arnoldsson's hypnotic conditioning he could be taught all that\nit was necessary for him to know ... maybe.\n\nBest of all, though, he was thoroughly expendable.\n\nSo Jason made a deal with him. There could be no expeditions into the\ncities until the satellite was finished, because every man was needed\nat the settlement. And the satellite could not be finished until\nsomeone volunteered to go up in the rocket and assemble it.\n\nIt was like holding a candy bar in front of a small child. He accepted\nJason's terms.\n\n\n\nThe Earth turned, and with it the tiny spark of life alone in the\nemptiness around the satellite. Tom worked unmindful of time, his eyes\nand hands following Jason's engineering commands through Arnoldsson's\npost-hypnotic directions, with occasional radio conferences.\n\nBut his conscious mind sought refuge from the strangeness of space,\nand he talked almost constantly into his radio while he worked, talked\nabout anything, everything, to the girl on the other end of the\ninvisible link.\n\n\"... and once the settlement is getting the power beamed from this\ncontraption, we're going to explore the cities. Guess we won't be\nable to get very far inland, but we can still tackle Washington,\nPhiladelphia and New York ... plenty for us there.\"\n\nRuth asked, \"What were they like before the war?\"\n\n\"The cities? That's right, you're too young to remember. They were big,\nRuth, with buildings so tall people called them skyscrapers.\" He pulled\na wrench from its magnetic holder in the satellite's self-contained\ntool bin. \"And filled with life. Millions of people lived in each\none ... all the people we have at the settlement could have lived on\none floor of a good-sized hotel....\"\n\n\"What's a hotel?\"\n\n\n\nTom grinned as he tugged at a pipe fitting. \"You'll find out when you\ncome with us ... you'll see things you could never imagine.\"\n\n\"I don't know if I'll come with you.\"\n\nHe looked up from his work and stared Earthward. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Well ... Jason ... he says there isn't much left to see. And it's all\nradioactive and diseased.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\n\"But Jason says....\"\n\nTom snorted. \"Jason hasn't been out of the settlement for six years.\nI walked from Chicago to the settlement a year ago. I went through\na dozen cities ... they're wrecked, and the radioactivity count was\nhigher than it is here at the settlement, but it's not high enough to\nbe dangerous.\"\n\n\"And you want to explore those cities; why?\"\n\n\"Let's just say I'm a historian,\" Tom answered while his hands\nmanipulated complex wiring unconsciously, as though they belonged not\nto him but to some unseen puppeteer.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Ruth said.\n\n\"Look--those cities hold mankind's memory. I want to gather up the\nfragments of civilization before the last book is used for kindling and\nthe last machine turns to rust. We need the knowledge in the cities if\nwe expect to rebuild a civilization....\"\n\n\"But Jason and Dr. Arnoldsson and the engineers--they know all\nabout....\"\n\n\"Jason and the engineers,\" Tom snapped. \"They had to stretch themselves\nto the breaking point to put together this rocket from parts that were\nalready manufactured, waiting for them. Do you think they'd know how to\nbuild a city? Dr. Arnoldsson is a psychiatrist; his efforts at surgery\nare pathetic. Have you ever seen him try to set a broken leg? And what\nabout agriculture? What about tool-making or mining or digging wells,\neven ... what about education? How many kids your own age can read or\nwrite?\"\n\n\"But the satellite....\"\n\n\"The satellite won't be of any use to people who can't work the\nmachines. The satellite is no substitute for knowledge. Unless\nsomething is done, your grandchildren will be worshipping the machines,\nbut they won't know how to repair them.\"\n\n\"No....\"\n\n\"Yes, Ruth,\" he insisted.\n\n\"No,\" she whispered, her voice barely audible over the static-streaked\nhum in his earphones. \"You're wrong, Tom. You're wrong. The satellite\nwill send us the power we need. Then we'll build our machines and teach\nour children.\"\n\n_How can you teach what you don't know?_ Tom wanted to ask, but didn't.\nHe worked without talking, hauling the weightless tons of satellite\npackages into position, electronically welding them together, splicing\nwiring systems too intricate for his conscious mind to understand.\n\n\n\nTwice he pulled himself back along the lifeline into the ship for\ncapsule meals and stimulants.\n\nFinally he found himself staring at his gloved hands moving\nindustriously within the bowels of one of the satellite packages. He\nstopped, suddenly aware that it was piercingly cold and totally dark\nexcept for the lamp on his helmet.\n\nHe pushed away from the unfinished satellite. Two of the packages were\nassembled now. The big parabolic mirror and two other uncrated units\nhung nearby, waiting impassively.\n\nTom groped his way back into the ship. After taking off his helmet and\nswallowing a couple of energy pills he said to the ship's radio:\n\n\"What time is it?\" The abrupt sound of his own voice half-startled him.\n\n\"Nearly four a.m.\" It was Jason.\n\n\"Earth's blotted out the sun,\" Tom muttered. \"Getting damned cold in\nhere.\"\n\n\"You're in the ship?\"\n\n\"Yes. It got too cold for the suit.\"\n\n\"Turn up the ship's heaters,\" Jason said. \"What's the temperature in\nthere?\"\n\nTom glanced at the thermometer as he twisted the thermostat dial as far\nas it would go. \"Forty-nine,\" he answered.\n\nHe could sense Jason nod. \"The heaters are on minimum power\nautomatically unless you turn them up. It'll warm you up in a few\nseconds. How's the satellite?\"\n\nTom told him what remained to be done.\n\n\"You're not even half through yet.\" Jason's voice grew fainter and Tom\nknew that he was doing some mental arithmetic as he thought out loud.\n\"You've been up about twenty hours; at the rate you're going you'll\nneed another twenty-four to finish the job. That will bring you very\nclose to your oxygen limit.\"\n\nTom sat impassively and stared at the gray metal and colored knobs of\nthe radio.\n\n\"Is everything going all right?\" Jason asked.\n\n\"How should I know? Ask Arnoldsson.\"\n\n\"He's asleep. They all are.\"\n\n\"Except you.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Jason said, \"except me.\"\n\n\"How long did Ruth stay on the radio?\"\n\n\"About sixteen hours. I ordered her to sleep a few hours ago.\"\n\n\"You're pretty good at giving orders,\" Tom said.\n\n\"Someone has to.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Tom ran a hand across his mouth. _Boy, could I use a cigarette.\nFunny, I haven't even thought about them in years._\n\n\n\n\"Look,\" he said to the radio, \"we might as well settle something right\nnow. How many men are you going to let me have?\"\n\n\"Don't you think you'd better save that for now and get back to work?\"\n\n\"It's too damned cold out there. My fingers are still numb. You could\nhave done a better job on insulating this suit.\"\n\n\"There are a lot of things we could have done,\" Jason said, \"if we had\nthe material.\"\n\n\"How about the expedition? How many men can I have?\"\n\n\"As many as you can get,\" the radio voice answered. \"I promised I won't\nstand in your way once the satellite is finished and operating.\"\n\n\"Won't stand in my way,\" Tom repeated. \"That means you won't encourage\nanyone, either.\"\n\nJason's voice rose a trifle. \"I can't encourage my people to go out and\nrisk their lives just because you want to poke around some radioactive\nslag heaps!\"\n\n\"You promised that if I put the satellite together and got back alive,\nI could investigate the cities. That was our deal.\"\n\n\"That's right. You can. And anyone foolish enough to accompany you can\nfollow along.\"\n\n\"Jason, you know I need at least twenty-five armed men to venture out\nof the settlement....\"\n\n\"Then you admit it's dangerous!\" the radio voice crackled.\n\n\"Sure, if we meet a robber band. You've sent out enough foraging groups\nto know that. And we'll be travelling hundreds of miles. But it's not\ndangerous for the reasons you've been circulating ... radioactivity and\ndisease germs and that nonsense. There's no danger that one of your own\nforaging groups couldn't handle. I came through the cities last year\nalone, and I made it.\"\n\n\n\nTom waited for a reply from the radio, but only the hissing and\ncrackling of electrical disturbances answered him.\n\n\"Jason, those cities hold what's left of a world-wide civilization. We\ncan't begin to rebuild unless we reopen that knowledge. We need it, we\nneed it desperately!\"\n\n\"It's either destroyed or radioactive, and to think anything else is\nself-delusion. Besides, we have enough intelligence right here at the\nsettlement to build a new civilization, better than the old one, once\nthe satellite is ready.\"\n\n\"But you don't!\" Tom shouted. \"You poor damned fool, you don't even\nrealize how much you don't know.\"\n\n\"This is a waste of time,\" Jason snapped. \"Get outside and finish your\nwork.\"\n\n\"I'm still cold, dammit,\" Tom said. He glanced at the thermometer on\nthe control console. \"Jason! _It's below freezing in here!_\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The heating unit isn't working at all!\"\n\n\"Impossible. You must have turned it off instead of on.\"\n\n\"I can read, dammit! It's turned as high as it'll go....\"\n\n\"What's the internal thermometer reading?\"\n\nTom looked. \"Barely thirty ... and it's still going down.\"\n\n\"Hold on, I'll wake Arnoldsson and the electrical engineers.\"\n\nSilence. Tom stared at the inanimate radio which gave off only the\nwhines and scratches of lightning and sun and stars, all far distant\nfrom him. For all his senses could tell him, he was the last living\nthing in the universe.\n\n_Sure, call a conference_, Tom thought. _How much more work is there\nto be done? About twenty-four hours, he said. Another day. And another\nfull night. Another night, this time with no heat. And maybe no oxygen,\neither. The heaters must have been working tonight until I pushed them\nup to full power. Something must have blown out. Maybe it's just a\nbroken wire. I could fix that if they tell me how. But if it's not ...\nno heat tomorrow night, no heat at all._\n\nThen Arnoldsson's voice floated up through the radio speaker: soft,\nfriendly, calm, soothing....\n\n\n\nThe next thing Tom knew he was putting on his helmet. Sunlight was\nlancing through the tinted observation port and the ship was noticeably\nwarmer.\n\n\"What happened?\" he mumbled through the dissolving haze of hypnosis.\n\n\"It's all right, Tom.\" Ruth's voice. \"Dr. Arnoldsson put you under and\nhad you check the ship's wiring. Now he and Jason and the engineers\nare figuring out what to do. They said it's nothing to worry about ...\nthey'll have everything figured out in a couple of hours.\"\n\n\"And I'm to work on the satellite until they're ready?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Don't call us, we'll call you.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"It's all right, Tom. Don't worry.\"\n\n\"Sure Ruth, I'm not worried.\" _That makes us both liars._\n\nHe worked mechanically, handling the unfamiliar machinery with the\nengineers' knowledge through Arnoldsson's hypnotic communication.\n\n_Just like the pictures they used to show of nuclear engineers handling\nradioactive materials with remotely-controlled mechanical hands from\nbehind a concrete wall. I'm only a pair of hands, a couple of opposed\nthumbs, a fortunate mutation of a self-conscious simian ... but, God,\nwhy don't they call? She said it wasn't anything big. Just the wiring,\nprobably. Then why don't they call?_\n\nHe tried to work without thinking about anything, but he couldn't\nforce his mind into stillness.\n\n_Even if I can fix the heaters, even if I don't freeze to death, I\nmight run out of oxygen. And how am I going to land the ship? The\ntakeoff was automatic, but even Jason and Arnoldsson can't make a pilot\nout of me...._\n\n\"Tom?\" Jason's voice.\n\n\"Yes!\" He jerked to attention and floated free of the satellite.\n\n\"We've ... eh, checked what you told us about the ship's electrical\nsystem while Arnoldsson had you under the hypnotic trance....\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"Well ... it, eh, looks as though one of the batteries gave out. The\nbatteries feed all the ship's lights, heat, and electrical power ...\nwith one of them out, you don't have enough power to run the heaters.\"\n\n\"There's no way to fix it?\"\n\n\"Not unless you cut out something else. And you need everything\nelse ... the radio, the controls, the oxygen pumps....\"\n\n\"What about the lights? I don't need them, I've got the lamp on my suit\nhelmet.\"\n\n\"They don't take as much power as the heaters do. It wouldn't help at\nall.\"\n\nTom twisted weightlessly and stared back at Earth. \"Well just what the\nhell am I supposed to _do_?\"\n\n\"Don't get excited,\" Jason's voice grated in his earphones. \"We've\ncalculated it all out. According to our figures, your suit will store\nenough heat during the day to last the night....\"\n\n\"I nearly froze to death last night and the ship was heated most of the\ntime!\"\n\n\"It will get cold,\" Jason's voice answered calmly, \"but you should be\nable to make it. Your own body warmth will be stored by the suit's\ninsulation, and that will help somewhat. But you must not open the suit\nall night, not even to take off your helmet.\"\n\n\"And the oxygen?\"\n\n\"You can take all the replacement cylinders from the ship and keep\nthem at the satellite. The time you save by not having to go back and\nforth to the ship for fresh oxygen will give you about an hour's extra\nmargin. You should be able to make it.\"\n\nTom nodded. \"And of course I'm expected to work on the satellite right\nthrough the night.\"\n\n\"It will help you keep your mind off the cold. If we see that you're\nnot going to make it--either because of the cold or the oxygen--we'll\nwarn you and you can return to the settlement.\"\n\n\"Suppose I have enough oxygen to just finish the satellite, but if I\ndo, I won't have enough to fly home. Will you warn me then?\"\n\n\"Don't be dramatic.\"\n\n\"Go to hell.\"\n\n\"Dr. Arnoldsson said he could put you under,\" Jason continued\nunemotionally, \"but he thinks you might freeze once your conscious mind\nwent asleep.\"\n\n\"You've figured out all the details,\" Tom muttered. \"All I have to do\nis put your damned satellite together without freezing to death and\nthen fly 22,500 miles back home before my air runs out. Simple.\"\n\nHe glanced at the sun, still glaring bright even through his tinted\nvisor. It was nearly on the edge of the Earth-disk.\n\n\"All right,\" Tom said, \"I'm going into the ship now for some pills;\nit's nearly sunset.\"\n\n\n\nCold. Dark and so cold that numbers lost their meaning. Paralyzing\ncold, seeping in through the suit while you worked, crawling up your\nlimbs until you could hardly move. The whole universe hung up in the\nsky and looked down on the small cold figure of a man struggling\nblindly with machinery he could not understand.\n\nDark. Dark and cold.\n\nRuth stayed on the radio as long as Jason would allow her, talking to\nTom, keeping the link with life and warmth. But finally Jason took\nover, and the radio went silent.\n\n_So don't talk_, Tom growled silently, _I can keep warm just by hating\nyou, Jason._\n\nHe worked through the frigid night, struggling ant-like with huge\npieces of equipment. Slowly he assembled the big parabolic mirror, the\nsighting mechanism and the atomic convertor. With dreamy motions he\nstarted connecting the intricate wiring systems.\n\nAnd all the while he raged at himself: _Why? Why did it have to be this\nway? Why me? Why did I agree to do this? I knew I'd never live through\nit; why did I do it?_\n\nHe retraced the days of his life: the preparations for the flight, the\narguments with Jason over exploring the cities, his trek from Chicago\nto the settlement, the aimless years after the radiation death of his\ntwo boys and Marjorie, his wife.\n\nMarjorie and the boys, lying sick month after month, dying one after\nthe other in a cancerous agony while he stood by helplessly in the\nruins of what had been their home.\n\n_No!_ His mind warned him. _Don't think of that. Not that. Think of\nJason, Jason who prevents you from doing the one thing you want, who\nis taking your life from you; Jason, the peerless leader; Jason, who's\nafraid of the cities. Why? Why is he afraid of the cities? That's the\nhub of everything down there. Why does Jason fear the cities?_\n\n\n\nIt wasn't until he finished connecting the satellite's last unit--the\nsighting mechanism--that Tom realized the answer.\n\nOne answer. And everything fell into place.\n\nEverything ... except what Tom Morris was going to do about it.\n\nTom squinted through the twin telescopes of the sighting mechanism\nagain, then pushed away and floated free, staring at the Earth bathed\nin pale moonlight.\n\n_What do I do now?_ For an instant he was close to panic, but he forced\nit down. _Think_, he said to himself. _You're supposed to be a Homo\nSapiens ... use that brain. Think!_\n\nThe long night ended. The sun swung around from behind the bulk of\nEarth. Tom looked at it as he felt its warmth penetrating the insulated\nsuit, and he knew it was the last time he would see the sun. He felt no\nmore anger--even his hatred of Jason was drained out of him now. In its\nplace was a sense of--finality.\n\nHe spoke into his helmet mike. \"Jason.\"\n\n\"He is in conference with the astronomers.\" Dr. Arnoldsson's voice.\n\n\"Get him for me, please.\"\n\nA few minutes of silence, broken only by the star-whisperings in his\nearphones.\n\nJason's voice was carefully modulated. \"Tom, you made it.\"\n\n\"I made it. And the satellite's finished.\"\n\n\"It's finished? Good. Now, what we have to do....\"\n\n\"Wait,\" Tom interrupted. \"It's finished but it's useless.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nTom twisted around to look at the completed satellite, its oddly-angled\nframework and bulbous machinery glinting fiercely in the newly-risen\nsun. \"After I finished it I looked through the sighting mechanism to\nmake certain the satellite's transmitters were correctly aimed at the\nsettlement. Nobody told me to, but nobody said not to, either, so I\nlooked. It's a simple mechanism.... The transmitters are pointed smack\nin the middle of Hudson's Bay.\"\n\n\"You're sure?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"You can rotate the antennas....\"\n\n\"I know. I tried it. I can turn them as far south as the Great Lakes.\"\n\nA long pause.\n\n\"I was afraid of this,\" Jason's voice said evenly.\n\n_I'll bet you were_, Tom answered to himself.\n\n\"You must have moved the satellite out of position while assembling its\ncomponents.\"\n\n\n\n\"So my work here comes to nothing because the satellite's power beam\ncan't reach the settlement's receivers.\"\n\n\"Not ... not unless you use the ship ... to tow the satellite into the\nproper orbital position,\" Jason stammered.\n\n_You actually went through with it_, Tom thought. Aloud, he said, \"But\nif I use the ship's engine to tow the satellite, I won't have enough\nfuel left to get back to Earth, will I?\" _Not to mention oxygen._\n\nA longer pause. \"No.\"\n\n\"I have two questions, Jason. I think I know the answers to them both\nbut I'll ask you anyway. One. You knew this would happen, didn't you?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"You've calculated this insane business down to the last drop of\nsweat,\" Tom growled. \"You knew that I'd knock the satellite out of\nposition while I was working on it, and the only way to get it back in\nthe right orbit would be for me to tow it back and strand myself up\nhere. This is a suicide mission, isn't it, Jason?\"\n\n\"That's not true....\"\n\n\"Don't bother defending yourself. I don't hate you anymore, Jason, I\nunderstand you, dammit. You made our deal as much to get rid of me as\nto get your precious satellite put together.\"\n\n\"No one can force you to tow the satellite....\"\n\n\"Sure, I can leave it where it is and come back home. If I can fly this\nship, which I doubt. And what would I come back to? I left a world\nwithout power. I'd return to a world without hope. And some dark night\none of your disappointed young goons would catch up with me ... and no\none would blame him, would they?\"\n\nJason's voice was brittle. \"You'll tow it into position?\"\n\n\"After you answer my second question,\" Tom countered. \"Why are you\nafraid of the cities?\"\n\n\"Afraid? I'm not afraid.\"\n\n\"Yes you are. Oh, you could use the hope of exploring the cities to\nlure me up here on this suicide-job, but you knew I'd never be back\nto claim my half of the bargain. You're afraid of the cities, and I\nthink I know why. You're afraid of the unknown quantity they represent,\ndistrustful of your own leadership when new problems arise....\"\n\n\"We've worked for more than ten years to make this settlement what it\nis,\" Jason fumed. \"We fought and died to keep those marauding lunatics\nfrom wrecking us. We are mankind's last hope! We can't afford to let\nothers in ... they're not scientists, they wouldn't understand, they'd\nruin everything.\"\n\n\"Mankind's last hope, terrified of men.\" Tom was suddenly tired, weary\nof the whole struggle. But there was something he had to tell them.\n\n\"Listen Jason,\" he said. \"The walls you've built around the\nsettlement weren't meant to keep you from going outside. You're not\na self-sufficient little community ... you're cut off from mankind's\nmemory, from his dreams, from his ambitions. You can't even start to\nrebuild a civilization--and if you do try, don't you think the people\noutside will learn about it? Don't you think they've got a right to\nshare in whatever progress the settlement makes? And if you don't let\nthem, don't you realize that they'll destroy the settlement?\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\n\n\"I'm a historian,\" Tom continued, \"and I know that a civilization\ncan't exist in a vacuum. If outsiders don't conquer it, it'll rot from\nwithin. It's happened to Babylonia, Greece, Rome, China, even. Over and\nagain. The Soviets built an Iron Curtain around themselves, and wiped\nthemselves out because of it.\n\n\"Don't you see, Jason? There are only two types of animals on this\nplanet: the gamblers and the extinct. It won't be easy to live with\nthe outsiders, there'll be problems of every type. But the alternative\nis decay and destruction. _You've got to take the chance, if you don't\nyou're dead._\"\n\nA long silence. Finally Jason said, \"You've only got about a\nhalf-hour's worth of oxygen left. Will you tow the satellite into the\nproper position?\"\n\nTom stared at the planet unseeingly. \"Yes,\" he mumbled.\n\n\"I'll have to check some calculations with the astronomers,\" Jason's\nvoice buzzed flatly in his earphones.\n\nA background murmur, scarcely audible over the crackling static.\n\nThen Ruth's voice broke through, \"Tom, Tom, you can't do this! You\nwon't be able to get back!\"\n\n\"I know,\" he said, as he started pulling his way along the lifeline\nback to the ship.\n\n\"_No!_ Come back, Tom, please. Come back. Forget the satellite. Come\nback and explore the cities. I'll go with you. Please. Don't die, Tom,\nplease don't die....\"\n\n\"Ruth, Ruth, you're too young to cry over me. I'll be all right, don't\nworry.\"\n\n\"No, it isn't fair.\"\n\n\"It never is,\" Tom said. \"Listen, Ruth. I've been dead a long time.\nSince the bombs fell, I guess. My world died then and I died with it.\nWhen I came to the settlement, when I agreed to make this flight, I\nthink we all knew I'd never return, even if we wouldn't admit it to\nourselves. But I'm just one man, Ruth, one small part of the story. The\nstory goes on, with or without me. There's tomorrow ... your tomorrow.\nI've got no place in it, but it belongs to you. So don't waste your\ntime crying over a man who died eighteen years ago.\"\n\nHe snapped off his suit radio and went the rest of the way to the ship\nin silence. After locking the hatch and pumping air back into the\ncabin, he took off his helmet.\n\n_Good clean canned air_, Tom said to himself. _Too bad it won't last\nlonger._\n\n\n\nHe sat down and flicked a switch on the radio console. \"All right, do\nyou have those calculations ready?\"\n\n\"In a few moments....\" Arnoldsson's voice.\n\nTen minutes later Tom re-emerged from the ship and made his ghost-like\nway back to the satellite's sighting mechanism. He checked the\nartificial moon's position, then went back to the ship.\n\n\"On course,\" he said to the radio. \"The transmitters are pointing a\nlittle northwest of Philadelphia.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Arnoldsson's voice answered. \"Now, your next blast should be\nthree seconds' duration in the same direction....\"\n\n\"No,\" Tom said, \"I've gone as far as I'm going to.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I'm not moving the satellite any farther.\"\n\n\"But you still have not enough fuel to return to Earth. Why are you\nstopping here?\"\n\n\"I'm not coming back,\" Tom answered. \"But I'm not going to beam the\nsatellite's power to the settlement, either.\"\n\n\"_What are you trying to pull?_\" Jason's voice. Furious. Panicky.\n\n\"It's simple, Jason. If you want the satellite's power, you can\ndismantle the settlement and carry it to Pennsylvania. The transmitters\nare aimed at some good farming country, and within miles of a city\nthat's still half-intact.\"\n\n\"You're insane!\"\n\n\"Not at all. We're keeping our deal, Jason. I'm giving you the\nsatellite's power, and you're going to allow exploration of the cities.\nYou won't be able to prevent your people from rummaging through the\ncities now; and you won't be able to keep the outsiders from joining\nyou, not once you get out from behind your own fences.\"\n\n\"You can't do this! You....\"\n\nTom snapped off the radio. He looked at it for a second or two, then\nsmashed a heavy-booted foot against the console. Glass and metal\ncrashed satisfactorily.\n\n_Okay_, Tom thought, _it's done. Maybe Jason's right and I'm crazy,\nbut we'll never know now. In a year or so they'll be set up outside\nPhiladelphia, and a lot better for it, I'm forcing them to take the\nlong way back, but it's a better way. The only way, maybe._\n\nHe leaned back in the seat and stared out the observation port at the\ncompleted satellite. Already it was taking in solar energy and beaming\nit Earthward.\n\n_In ten years they'll send another ship up here to check the gadget and\nmake sure everything's okay. Maybe they'll be able to do it in five\nyears. Makes no difference. I'll still be here._\n\n\n                                THE END",
