    "body": "It all started at Bandar Shahpur. You see, I'm a railroad construction\nman. Our job was finished, and the whole outfit was waiting at Bandar\nShahpur, which is on the inlet Khor Musa of the Persian Gulf, for a\nboat to take us back to America.\n\nAnd there, out of nowhere, this Dr. Champ Chadwick showed up. He seemed\nto be starving for a little good old U.S.A. palaver, and I guess that's\nwhy we struck up an acquaintance.\n\n\"I've been doing a little digging over in Iraq,\" he said offhand.\n\"But things quieted down there. So now I'm bound for the desert\nand mountains to the north of here. This railroad has opened things\nup. It's difficult to get an expedition financed, you know, and\ntransportation is sometimes the chief item.\"\n\nI began to catch on that he was one of those guys who dig up ruins\nand things, and read a country's whole past from what they find.\nThen he went on to tell that he'd been sent out by a university in\nPennsylvania, but that this present trip was just a sudden idea of his\nown.\n\nAnd as he talked I began to like Dr. Chadwick. He was a serious-faced,\nrawboned little guy--not half my size--with steady eyes, a firm chin,\nand black hair plastered down slick on his head. By and by he got\naround to mention that he was looking for a strong-backed man to take\nalong with him.\n\n\"I intend to strike out from Qum, the holy city,\" he said. \"I'll try to\nget hold of a motor-truck there--and one of these desert men to drive\nit. They're rotten drivers though,\" he added, \"and next to a dead loss\non a trip like this.\" Then he sighed. \"But I'm getting used to 'em.\"\n\n\"What do you expect to find up there?\" I asked.\n\n\"The usual thing,\" he answered, as if that ought to explain everything.\n\"This country is full of ruins. It's so old, in fact, that sometimes I\nthink that everything that can happen has already happened here, at one\ntime or another. Take Qum, for instance. A few years back there were\ntwenty thousand ruined and deserted buildings still standing. These\nwalled towns are like coral islands, surrounded and upheld by the dust\nand decay of their own past. But I'm looking for something farther\nback--much farther back.\"\n\nHe paused, then suddenly his eyes brightened. \"There's one thing,\nthough. I may have a try at finding the Ice Stone.\"\n\n\"The Ice Stone?\" I echoed. \"And what's that?\"\n\n\"Perhaps just a legend. It isn't likely you would ever have heard of\nit. It's supposed to be a black stone, a huge, square block, set in\nthe side of a mountain. If a man touches it, his hand sinks in, and he\ncan get loose only by amputating. The queer part is, there seems to be\nsome basis for the legend. All down through Iran's history there are\ndisconnected references. The thing keeps cropping up. Vague reports\nfrom wandering tribes, with one or more cripples, minus an arm or leg,\nto verify the yarn. So, I may take a shot at locating the Ice Stone.\"\n\nQueer stories like that are quite common in Iran. Ordinarily I'd have\nlaughed and forgotten it. But as I say, I'd taken a sort of liking to\nthis serious-faced little Dr. Champ Chadwick. And when you like a man\nyou're bound to think twice before discrediting what he believes in.\n\n\"So you'll be taking a ride over this crazy railroad,\" I remarked\nthoughtfully, somewhat later.\n\nHe nodded. \"What makes you call it crazy?\"\n\nWell, I told him. Of course he already knew quite a lot about Iran's\nnew railroad--the many-million dollar toy of the \"Brother of the\nMoon and Stars,\" as the fancy-tongued Iranians like to call their\nshah. This road writhes and twists and climbs through eight hundred\nmiles of queer, mountainous country--a country of mud and rocks and\nsalt-swamps--and carefully avoids all the important towns. You see,\nthe \"King of Kings\"--another pet name for Shah Pahlavi--is afraid some\nof his neighbors might get control of the road and use it against him.\nThese same neighbors sneeringly refer to it as the road that leads from\n\"nowhere to nowhere.\"\n\nPerhaps they aren't far wrong. But this road was the reason for my\nmeeting up with Dr. Champ Chadwick.\n\nThe last spike, a gold one, had just been hammered into its tie by\nthe \"Most Lofty of Living Men\" himself. That put our outfit out of\na job temporarily. You see, I'd been working for McKardin-Malroy, an\nAmerican contracting company, to whom the Shah had let out part of the\nconstructional works on his railroad.\n\nSo, in the end, I of course took the job this Chadwick had sort of\ndangled under my nose. The pay wasn't anything worth mentioning; but,\nas I found out later, he himself was supplying the cash for this trip\nout of his own pocket. He didn't have much, and so expenses had to be\ncut to the limit.\n\nThings moved fast after that. I'd always had an idea that such trips\nwere planned carefully, months in advance, detail by detail. But this\nDoc Champ, as I got to calling him, didn't seem to plan anything--he\njust acted.\n\nThe next day Doc and I rode back over that crazy railroad I'd helped\nbuild--a road that winds through a maze of tunnels, one a grotesque\nspiral affair, over high bridges and gorge viaducts. We passed through\nDizful, famed city of rats; Sultanabad, city of rugs; and on to the\nholy city of Qum.\n\nTwo days later, with Doc's whole scant outfit stored in the truck he'd\nmanaged to purchase, we were grinding out through squalid towns of\nancient, one-story huts toward the salt swamp of Kavir and the lonely\nstretch of mountains to the north.\n\n\"Notice the way the dew lies there on the grass?\" he said to me one\nmorning, just as the sun was rising and we were breaking camp. \"We\nslept right over the foundation walls of what was once part of an\nancient city.\"\n\nI squinted at where he was pointing, and, sure enough, I could see the\ngrass was all marked out in big squares--showing up only in the way the\ndew sparkled, or didn't sparkle, in the slanting sunlight.\n\n\"Difference in heat and moisture conductivity,\" explained Doc. \"Those\nwalls are probably only a little way beneath the surface.\"\n\n\"You want to dig here?\" I asked him.\n\nHe shook his head. Since that time when he told me about the Ice Stone,\nhe'd never mentioned it again. But I had noticed him squinting at all\nthe mountains we passed, and sometimes I'd see a queer expression on\nhis face, like a man who catches himself doing something that hasn't\ngot good sense back of it.\n\nIn fact, by the end of the week, I had about decided that he didn't\nhave any better idea as to why we'd come out here than I did.\n\nI think it was on the seventh day that we came upon a queer-looking\ncountry--isolated masses of rock, like big blocks, sticking up out of\nthe ground. Beyond these was a range of low mountains, or big hills,\nwhichever way you look at it.\n\n\"We'll camp here for a day,\" said Doc. \"How's the water?\"\n\n\"About gone,\" I told him.\n\n\"Good,\" he nodded. \"We'll run the truck up to the foot of those big\nhills and find some.\"\n\nI headed that old bus for a sort of fold in the hills ahead, and when\nthe ground began to get pretty rough we stopped and went on afoot, each\ncarrying a couple of empty water buckets. It wasn't long before we\nfound a shallow stream.\n\n\"There may be a spring farther up,\" said Doc.\n\nHe started splashing along the creek bed, for it was bordered by dense\nthickets of \"jangal\"--birch and box--through which you could scarcely\nsqueeze.\n\nI followed him. Pretty soon I smelled smoke.\n\n\"Hey, Doc!\" I called, \"something's burning.\"\n\nHe stopped and turned around. There was a queer look in his eyes,\nalmost like he wasn't all there--dopey.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, not seeming surprised at all. Then he pointed ahead.\n\"Smoke--I saw it some time back.\"\n\nHe started on again. The whole thing wasn't natural. For almost a week\nwe had seen no living human being. And now, smoke--a wood fire, as I\ncould tell by the scent--seemed to mean that we were getting near where\nsomeone lived. And yet, Doc hadn't thought it worth mentioning!\n\nWell, I followed him on for a hundred yards. Then we turned a bend in\nthe creek. The jangal opened up, and there, under the spread of a huge\nplane-tree, was the fire.\n\nIt was a small fire. Over it, roasting to a turn, were three dangling\nfowls; and near by stood a strange human figure--a man.\n\nHe beckoned to us. And as we approached he stood with folded arms,\nfacing us.\n\n\"I am Rog Tanlu,\" he said in stiff but absolutely correct English. \"I\ncalled you, and you came.\"\n\nDoc Champ, ahead of me, straightened with a start. It was almost as\nthough he had just realized the queerness of all this.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" I heard him gasp softly.\n\nThen we both stood there, staring at that chap who called himself Rog\nTanlu. He was dressed in a glove-fitting garment that appeared to be\nmade of fawn-colored silk--which was odd enough. But the man himself\nlooked still stranger. He was no Iranian--no Kurd, Kashgais nor\nBakhtiaris. I could have sworn to that.\n\nHe was very light skinned--lighter than any Persian--with a kind of\npallor, although not an unhealthy look, as though he'd spent all his\nlife indoors.\n\n\"Do not be alarmed,\" he said, smiling at us, and with a friendly look\nin his light blue eyes. \"I can well understand your surprise at finding\nme here. But I shall explain everything. Meanwhile, I have prepared\nfood, thinking you might be hungry. Will you join me?\"\n\nHe started dishing out those broiled fowls--black partridges, or\n\"durraj,\" I judged them to be--with the air of a man enjoying his first\noutdoor picnic and getting a big kick out of it.\n\n\"Here, Dr. Chadwick,\" he said, handing Doc one of those birds on a big\nleaf for a dish. \"And here's one for you, Mr. Lavin.\"\n\nWell, I took that broiled fowl and looked for a place to sit down.\nYou see my name is Lavin, Curt Lavin, but how he'd found it out was a\npuzzler. I looked at Doc Champ. He was staring at this Rog Tanlu as if\nseeing a ghost, or a man from Mars.\n\nThat kind of knocked me out. I put a lot of dependence on Doc's\nknowledge of human tribes and such. But evidently he couldn't tag on\nour host any more than I could.\n\nI started to sit down on a flat rock near the fire. And then I saw\nsomething standing on that rock--a thing like a tubular flashlight,\neight inches tall, with a globe of silvered glass at the upper end.\n\n\"You are wondering at the way I speak your language,\" I heard this Rog\nTanlu saying to Doc Champ. \"I have been learning it during the last few\ndays, but as yet am very lacking in fluency.\"\n\n\"You--you've been learning English?\" Doc Champ kind of gulped.\n\nRog Tanlu waved the bird-leg he was nibbling on.\n\n\"With the audio-visiscope,\" he explained.\n\nHe reached over and did something to that flashlight thing on the rock\nnear me. Right away it started talking--like a radio. But I knew it\nwasn't a radio. The speaker was someone cussing the King of Kings'\norder forbidding veils for Iranian women. And then I saw that what I\nhad thought was a reflection in that silvered globe was moving. It\nwasn't a reflection; it was a robed, turbaned mullah, and he went on\ntelling someone how unjust it was for a mullah to have to carry a\nlicense.\n\n\"Television,\" I heard Doc Champ mutter.\n\nI'll say it was, with a bang! And yet, not just that either. For you\nmay depend on it that no station was sending out such stuff.\n\nRog Tanlu shut the thing off, and the silver of that globe became dead\nblack. I started eating. There was nothing but coarse salt to go along\nwith the bird--the kind you can scrape off rocks near those mud-salt\nswamps--but the meat tasted okay. The others sat down and we finished\nthe three birds in no time.\n\n\"How'd you bag 'em?\" I asked Rog Tanlu, for I hadn't seen anything of a\ngun, and black pheasants aren't easy to knock over with a stone.\n\nRog Tanlu smiled and wiped his hands on that knit-silk outfit he was\nwearing. All the time during that meal he'd been smiling, squinting up\nat the sky and breathing deep--for all the world as though he'd never\nbeen on an outdoor party before.\n\n\"With this,\" he said, in answer to my question, picking up something\nfrom the rock near where he was sitting--something that looked like\na black fountain-pen--for there didn't seem to be any pockets in his\nclothing. Again he squinted up at the sky.\n\nJust then a buzzard came flying along slowlike, pretty high over our\nheads. Rog Tanlu pointed that pen affair up at the bird. A thin little\nray of light flashed up--another and another. They wavered around for\na second, getting centered. And suddenly that buzzard started tumbling\nout of the sky and crashed into the bushes near us.\n\nDoc Champ and I looked dumbly at each other. And then we stared at Rog\nTanlu. Grinning like a magician who has just pulled a fancy trick, he\nheld that ray-gun out for us to look at.\n\n\"What did you mean when you said you had called us?\" asked Doc Champ,\nin that quiet way of his.\n\n\"I had to get in communication with someone in this Age--someone who\ncould understand,\" said Rog Tanlu. \"I chose you\" (he was, of course,\nspeaking to Doc Champ) \"because of your training and comprehension of\nthe Past. So I called you with the psycho-coil on the audio-visiscope,\nby which means mental suggestions may be conveyed.\"\n\nDoc Champ swallowed hard. \"What country are you from?\"\n\n\"Iralnard,\" said Rog Tanlu. \"A nation which does not exist on earth\ntoday, but which was contemporary with the beginning of the last Ice\nAge. At that time my people occupied this very land. I am, as you might\nsay, a refugee from the Ice Age--the first to come through. But I\nbelieve that others will follow. A number of my people. This possible\nmigration cannot help but result in discord with the present holders\nof the land, unless some friendly agreement can be established. So I\ncalled you.\"\n\n\"Doc,\" I groaned, \"are we awake? Is this guy joking? Or what's the\nanswer?\"\n\nDoc pushed me away.\n\n\"I shall make everything clear,\" said Rog Tanlu.\n\n\"Let's get this straight,\" insisted Doc Champ. \"You say you are a\nrefugee from the Ice Age? But that was some five hundred thousand years\nago. And you are in possession of at least two instruments of advanced\nscience. It doesn't match up.\"\n\n\"It is quite necessary that you believe me.\" Rog Tanlu wasn't smiling\nnow, but was speaking very seriously. \"Perhaps you realize that it is\na trait of the human mind to look upon the Past as uncultured. Such an\nattitude is greatly in error.\"\n\n\"You traveled here through Time?\" asked Doc.\n\n\"Not exactly,\" said Rog Tanlu. \"Time, as you know, is merely the\nillusion experienced by creatures endowed with memory living in\na universe of random energy distribution. Time is movement, the\nrearrangement of matter--dependent upon the degree of entropy. I found\nit impossible to travel in Time. That's why I constructed the Ice\nStone.\"\n\n\"The Ice Stone!\" There was a kind of awe in Doc's voice. \"_You_ built\nthe Ice Stone?\"\n\nRog Tanlu nodded. \"Of course I didn't call it that. But I happened to\noverhear a conversation between you two, with the audio-visiscope,\nsome days ago, and thereby learned the name you have for it. A very\nappropriate name! I also learned that neither of you had ever seen it.\nSo now, if you will accompany me, I will take you to my laboratory--or\nrather to what still remains of my laboratory--and show you the Ice\nStone. That should simplify things, and may help us to solve the\nproblem of this impending migration--a problem which was forced on me\ndue to certain interference, as I will later explain.\"\n\nHe picked up that flashlight thing and started off up the creek bank.\n\nDoc Champ shot a glance at me as he wiped beads of perspiration from\nhis face with his old felt hat. The shiny black locks plastered down on\nhis head glinted as he stepped into the sunshine.\n\n\"Come along,\" he said to me. \"We'll see this through.\"\n\nWe followed Rog Tanlu. Presently he turned off the bank of the creek,\nand the path he chose got rocky and wild as hell. I began to understand\nwhy it was that so few people had ever run across the Ice Stone by\naccident.\n\n\"Doc,\" I whispered, \"what do you make of this guy? Did you ever hear\nsuch a crazy yarn?\"\n\n\"You forget,\" muttered Doc, \"that we saw some things, too.\"\n\nI knew what he meant. You couldn't get around that buzzard tumbling out\nof the sky, nor the mullah's image and voice in that silver globe.\n\nRog Tanlu was walking a few yards ahead of us. Suddenly I saw a\nqueer-looking object hanging in one of those scraggly trees that were\nhaving a hard time trying to grow there among the rocks. It looked\nlike a heavy blanket or garment, the same fawn-color as Rog Tanlu's\noutfit.\n\nHe stopped just opposite the tree where the thing was hanging from a\nlow branch.\n\n\"After emerging from the Ice Stone,\" he explained, \"I had to discard my\nouter clothing. The sudden climatic change was almost shocking.\" Then\nhe pointed upward and to the left along a broad ledge that seemed to\nzigzag down the rough face of a cliff, a hundred yards away.\n\nI guess Doc Champ had already caught sight of the Ice Stone. But I\nhadn't; and now with my first glimpse of it, the thing did look exactly\nlike ice. It was like a huge, square block, set flush with the face of\nthe cliff, and with that ledge forming a pathway up to it.\n\n\"Queer,\" I heard Doc Champ muttering. \"All the legends pertaining to\nthe Ice Stone mention its black appearance. That stone doesn't look\nblack--it looks transparent.\"\n\n\"Its color has recently changed,\" explained Rog Tanlu. \"It isn't a\nstone, or any material substance. It is a peculiar kind of space--space\nwith the third dimension, thickness in this instance, so twisted and\ncurved as to allow the fourth dimension to emerge from nothingness\ninto a certain hypostatic realness. Light has needed a long time to\npenetrate through it, and for that reason the cube has only recently\nassumed an apparent transparency. Now, if you will follow me, I will\nlead you to my laboratory.\"\n\nHe continued on around a shoulder of the cliff, so that we lost sight\nof the Ice Stone. Gigantic boulders all but blocked the way. However,\nour strange guide seemed to know where he was going and how to get\nthere.\n\n\"All these rocks didn't used to be here,\" he said musingly. \"They are\nevidently glacier d\u00c3\u00a9bris carried down since--well, since my time. Ah!\nHere we are.\"\n\nHe wormed his way through a narrow crevice. Doc and I followed. We\nsoon entered what at one time in the past must have been the wide mouth\nof an underground cavern.\n\nFor a moment we stood there, breathing the cold, moist air and staring\ninto the darkness.\n\nSuddenly a light flashed. I saw that Rog Tanlu was using that\nfountain-pen thing like a flashlight, but now it was sending out a\nblue-white radiance instead of those thin, death-dealing flashes.\n\n\"This was my laboratory,\" he said, holding the light at arm's length\nabove his head. \"There were big sliding doors that closed the place\nup tight and kept out the ice and the cold. I had some rather unique\nscientific apparatus here, but now it's all mouldering dust.\"\n\nHis voice sounded flat, there with the weight of rocks around us, and\nsad somehow.\n\nThe floor of the cavern slanted stiffly upward. As we advanced, the air\naround us kept getting colder and colder. It was like a gale from the\npoles blowing in our faces.\n\n\"We'll soon be directly behind the Ice Stone,\" said Rog Tanlu.\n\nA light began to appear ahead. I could see more of that cavern--even\nthe rock-ribbed ceiling high overhead. I can't express just what I\nwas thinking at that moment, but I saw Doc Champ kick at a mound of\nsomething underfoot. The mound crumbled; Doc stooped and picked up a\nround object, like a disk of rusted metal, and looked at it with a kind\nof stark wonder. Then he threw it away and we followed Rog Tanlu.\n\nThe light grew brighter, became a huge square of blustery, blue-white\nchaos. We were standing as if just within the maws of a Gargantuan\ndoorway--an open doorway through which we could look out over a scene\nof inexpressible dreariness.\n\nYou've seen pictures of the Antarctic? Titanic masses and pinnacles of\nice, frozen white barrens, a land without feeling or soul? It was like\nthat.\n\n\"We are looking through the Ice Stone.\" Rog Tanlu's voice was all but\nsnatched away by that glacial blast swishing in our faces. \"I set it\nup like a door--a door leading from my laboratory to the outside. The\nlight you see, and the wind, has taken half a million years to get\nthrough.\"\n\nDoc Champ was tugging at the collar of his coat, and my own teeth were\nchattering. Rog Tanlu motioned us to one side, out of that freezing\nblast.\n\n\"You see what we were up against?\" he smiled. \"Our space explorations\nhad killed the hope that some other planet in the system might offer\na suitable refuge where humans could live under anything like natural\nconditions.\n\n\"Moreover, there were social troubles. Politicians, philosophers and\nsociologists all combined to control science. A scientist had to get a\nspecial permit before he could conduct any new line of inquiry.\n\n\"So I built this laboratory--ten miles from the vitro-domed city of\nIralnard--partly to escape governmental interference and partly to\nkeep from being spied upon by Darlu Marc, another experimentalist and\npersonal enemy of mine. I worked here alone, except for one laboratory\nassistant--Eyoaoc Eiioiei, as I called him. And here we created the Ice\nStone.\n\n\"As I have already explained, it is no material thing--merely a cube\nof specialized space, foreshortened, warped and curved to attain\na specific result. Its action is very simple. It slows up a beam\nof light exactly as does a lens, but to an incomparably greater\ndegree. And being composed of nothing tangible, it acts on any moving\nthing--particle, atom or electron--exactly as it does on light photons.\n\n\"Thus a man can walk through the Ice Stone without sensing any\nchange. Yet every function of his being is retarded, including mental\nprocesses. And when he emerges from the other side, approximately half\na million years have elapsed. But once having touched it, say with his\nhand, he must not try to withdraw, for his hand will then be within a\nseparate and distinct macrocosm, uninfluenced by anything outside, and\nhe must follow on through.\n\n\"My intentions were, of course, to provide an avenue of escape from the\nIce Age we were entering, for I knew it wouldn't last indefinitely.\nBut I needed some sort of proof as to what conditions would be like\nin half a million years before I could offer the Ice Stone as a\npossible refuge. With Eyoaoc Eiioiei's help I managed to obtain several\nchemically depicted approximations of the nearby landscape as it would\nbe likely to appear after the Ice Age.\n\n\"These were very beautiful--or thus they seem to me--for you must\nremember that in my time no one had ever seen trees or grass or flowers\ngrowing naturally in the open.\n\n\"We had just completed all this when, as we were working one day here\nin the laboratory, my assistant sensed a snooper-ray on us. I myself\nam not sensitive to an audio-visiscope emanation--sometimes called the\n'snooper-ray'--but Eyoaoc Eiioiei sensed it, and he warned me.\n\n\"However, the warning came too late. Darlu Marc, my enemy, was the spy.\nWithin a few hours I was thrown in prison. Eyoaoc Eiioiei escaped. He\nwas almost immune to the outside cold.\n\n\"Darlu Marc had inveigled himself in with certain politicians and,\nas a reward for reporting my misconduct, he received charge of my\nlaboratory. But I knew that the Ice Stone was safe, being practically\nindestructible.\n\n\"Shortly thereafter, word came to me in prison that a company had been\nformed under Marc--a company that was selling tickets to the poorer\nclass of Iralnard City, entitling the holder to emigrate through the\nIce Stone. Their slogan was 'Tickets to Paradise.'\n\n\"Naturally, this injustice made me desperate. I swore that I'd be the\nfirst to pass through. In the meantime Eyoaoc Eiioiei had managed to\nenter Iralnard City, disguised. He was very attached to me. He helped\nme escape, helped me reach the laboratory. However, at the last moment,\nwe became separated. To avoid recapture I was forced to pass through\nthe Ice Stone alone.\n\n\"Now, my friends, you know why I am here.\"\n\nDoc was beating his arms to keep from freezing.\n\n\"If I understand you,\" he puffed, \"that thing\"--pointing toward the Ice\nStone--\"affords a short-cut into the future, by a kind of suspended\nanimation. And once there, you can't go back.\"\n\n\"Quite correct.\" Rog Tanlu seemed pleased. \"If I were to pass through\nit again, in either direction, I would not return to the Ice Age but\nwould take another jump into the future.\"\n\nIt sounded simple, as he told it, even to me, and Doc nodded.\n\n\"What seems queer,\" he observed, \"is about this cold and wind. I\nunderstand it's blowing from the outside cliff into the Ice Stone--from\nway back in the Ice Age--and is only now emerging here. In that case\nthe cube must have swallowed a tremendous amount of air--and energy!\"\n\n\"You grasp the idea,\" said Rog Tanlu, with quiet satisfaction. \"But\nyou must not judge the capacity of the Ice Stone by its external\ndimensions. They are quite deceptive. I assure you that its\nramifications in the fourth dimension would enable it to absorb a total\nof all telluric energies, and still have room to spare.... Come, my\nfriends, I had not realized that you were suffering from the cold! Let\nus return to the balmy open. I find your climate--inexpressible!\"\n\nWell, I wasn't sorry to hear this proposal. And judging by the way Doc\nChamp was frostily puffing and rubbing his ears, I guess he wasn't,\neither.\n\nWe soon got down to where the wind didn't hit so strong, and Doc\nstarted asking questions.\n\nWhen would the refugees start coming? Would Darlu Marc--Rog Tanlu's\nenemy--be among the first?\n\n\"He may never come,\" said Rog Tanlu bitterly. \"His purpose is to bleed\nthe people, sell them passage to this paradise. That would enable him\nto live in comparative security and comfort back in Iralnard City for\nthe remainder of his lifetime.\"\n\nI could see by the way he spoke that those half-million years\nseparating him from this guy Marc were pretty galling on Rog Tanlu.\n\nWe were moving slowly down toward that all-but-closed entrance, and now\nand then he would flash his light to show the way.\n\n\"Here's a strange thought,\" said Doc Champ suddenly, as he stumbled\nalong at my elbow. \"Why can't we go up on that ledge and look through\nthe Ice Stone from that direction? We ought to be able to see right\ninto your laboratory, as it was a short time after you left, and find\nout what's going on.\"\n\nRog Tanlu chuckled. \"Of course,\" he agreed eagerly. \"That's right\nwhere we're bound now. I've been hanging around there for nine\ndays--watching. But so far--\"\n\nA funny sound cut in on him--a sound coming from somewhere ahead. It\nwas like a voice--a metallic voice--thin and clear.\n\n\"_Rog Tanlu ... Rog Tanlu ... Rog Tan-lu._...\"\n\nThen I saw something move, there in the shadows, and goose-pimples\nsprang out on me. For as the light glinted on that thing, I saw it\nwasn't human.\n\n\"Eyoaoc Eiioiei!\" cried Rog Tanlu. \"He's come through--he has followed\nme!\"\n\nDid you ever see a dog frisk around someone he likes, someone he's been\nseparated from for a long time? Then picture the dog as no dog at all,\nbut a madhouse thing prancing on two jointed-metal legs, as thick as\nstovepipes, its eyes glinting ruby-red when they catch the light--\n\nBut the part that made cold shivers run up my back was the thing's\nhead--a round globe from which those ruby eyes sparkled. That head\nwasn't attached in any visible manner to its short, squat body, but\nseemed to float, six inches above its shoulders, as if poised there by\nsome magnetic force.\n\nAll the while the thing was capering around Rog Tanlu, it was jabbering\nat him in some outlandish tongue, and he was jabbering back at it.\n\nDoc Champ and I stood there staring.\n\nBut by and by I heard Doc's voice.\n\n\"A robot,\" he said, speaking softly and in kind of an awed tone. \"So\nhis laboratory assistant is a robot.\"\n\n\"No wonder it was immune to the cold,\" I gulped, swallowing hard.\n\nPresently Rog Tanlu swung around toward us and commenced to talk so we\ncould understand.\n\n\"Serious news,\" he bit out. \"Darlu Marc has delayed the emigration.\nBut he is sending a party of his vassals to wipe me out. He thinks\nI possess means to destroy the Ice Stone--thinks I'd do it out of\nsheer spite. He's wrong of course, in both instances. But the idea\nis hindering the sale of tickets. Eyoaoc Eiioiei learned of Marc's\nintentions. He managed at last to reach the Ice Stone, and bring me\nwarning. He emerged on the cliff side while we were in here. But an\narmed band of Marc's vassals are right on his heels!\"\n\nI couldn't tear my gaze from that thing he called Eyoaoc Eiioiei. It\nhad stopped frisking around him and was now blinking its ruby-red eyes\nat Doc Champ and me; and, I swear, I believe that damned thing was just\nas amazed and curious as I was.\n\n\"Do you mean,\" asked Doc, \"that these killers are outside now?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" answered Rog Tanlu. \"If so, they will soon find the\nentrance to my laboratory, since they are familiar with the terrain.\"\n\n\"Then we better sneak out of here,\" I suggested, not liking the idea\nof being bottled up, there in that hole.\n\n\"My friends,\" said Rog Tanlu, \"I regret having drawn you into this.\nLeave now; you may be able to escape undetected. But I shall await them\nhere, in this cavern which is very familiar to me.\"\n\nDoc Champ shook his head. I knew he wouldn't fall in with that plan.\n\n\"We're both armed,\" he told Rog Tanlu, slapping the automatic that\nsagged in his pocket. \"We'll hang around awhile.\"\n\nI guess I like this quality in Doc. Maybe it was partly the reason why\nI took to him.\n\nWell, I backed up the little guy ... but I thought he was wrong. That\nfight--if there was going to be a fight--wasn't ours. And I couldn't\njust see men with pistols getting very far against those fountain-pen\naffairs, like Rog Tanlu had. And then, there was that Eyoaoc\nEiioiei.... The whole thing was a little beyond my depths. I thought\nDoc was wrong to mix up in something we didn't know a cussed thing\nabout--and I still think so!\n\nRog Tanlu had switched off his light. We stood there in the dark\nlistening. But we didn't hear a sound.\n\nI groped around and touched Doc's arm.\n\n\"Doc,\" I whispered, \"let's slip down to the entrance and find out\nwhat's going on.\"\n\nAlthough my words shouldn't have carried six feet, that robot thing\nmust have heard me--and, stranger still, must have understood.\n\nFor immediately I heard a subdued, metallic jabbering, then Rog Tanlu's\nvoice speaking urgently to Doc and me.\n\n\"That would be very unwise. Eyoaoc Eiioiei suggests that it would be\nbetter for us three to withdraw farther from the entrance. He will\nremain here and act as guard. Moreover, I can easily learn, with the\naudio-visiscope, what is taking place outside--just as soon as I have\na moment of leisure. Come, my friends.\"\n\nWell, we faced around and started back. And I could hear that nightmare\nthing he called Eyoaoc Eiioiei moving on down toward the rock-choked\nentrance--its steps surprisingly soundless, considering its clumsy\nappearance.\n\nHowever, the entire arrangement didn't seem right to me, especially\nletting that thing plan our line of action as if it was one of us and,\nwell, alive.\n\nBut that robot-thing could certainly think, and fight, as I was shortly\nto learn!\n\nDoc Champ and I groped along after Rog Tanlu. He seemed to know right\nwhere he was going, and after a hundred feet or so he stopped.\n\nIt was not quite dark here--just enough light for us to see, in a\nvague sort of fashion, that he was bending over a low, flat block of\nstone, a stone suggesting that it had once served as the foundation for\nsome huge machine. I realized that he was setting up that flashlight\ncontraption with the black bulb at one end.\n\nAnd suddenly that bulb began to glow softly.\n\n\"Now,\" said Rog Tanlu, \"we'll see what's going on.\"\n\nThe three of us bent over the thing. What looked like reflections in it\nwere shifting around and around, and abruptly the steep face of a cliff\nswung into view. We could see the Ice Stone as it appeared from the\noutside, and the ledge running up to it.\n\nWe saw no one near the Ice Stone. But suddenly, under Rog Tanlu's\nswift adjustment, the image shifted and enlarged--like a movie\nclose-up--magnifying a certain portion of that ledge.\n\nAnd there, in a heap like cast-off cocoons, were some half-dozen of\nthose heavy, fawn-colored garments, identical with the one we had seen\nhanging in the tree.\n\n\"So-o-o,\" Rog Tanlu breathed tensely, \"Eyoaoc Eiioiei was right! They\n_have_ come! They must be--\"\n\nA startled shout cut off his words. It was followed by a blinding flash\nof light. Then hell suddenly broke loose down below us....\n\nIn that cavern-darkness the blast of light was, in itself, almost\nstunning; and following it were other blasts of equal intensity. Vision\nwas a torturing thing. It was like those brief but vivid glimpses\npresented by lightning during a summer storm at night.\n\nBut with hurting eyes I managed to discern a group of figures jamming\nthe entrance-way to the cavern, with Eyoaoc Eiioiei's weird shape\nlooming between us and them.\n\n\"Down!\" shouted Rog Tanlu to Doc and me. \"Down, behind the rock!\"\n\nIn a dim, bewildered way I realized that those flashes of light were\nfrom weapons in the hands of invaders--weapons trained on Eyoaoc\nEiioiei. But we, also, were directly in line.\n\nDoc Champ didn't seem to hear Rog Tanlu's order. He was staring down at\nthat weird sight--staring at Eyoaoc Eiioiei. And for a moment I, too,\nignored the warning. For that grotesque thing was fighting--fighting in\na way that was an astonishing sight to witness.\n\nThin, dazzling, rapierlike beams were flashing up at him and past him.\nBut Eyoaoc Eiioiei was avoiding those hissing shafts with a skill not\nhuman--a dancing, cavorting nightmare thing, silhouetted against and\nenmeshed by those lethal streaks of fire; and I saw that now and then\nfrom his metal hand flashed a return blast of radiance. He was standing\nbetween his master and his master's assassins, and such wild courage\nand savagery brought into my throat a choked feeling of admiration.\n\nA hissing white shaft flashed within a foot of my head, bringing me to\nmy senses. I made a grab at Doc Champ, intending to drag him down to\nsafety. Then I realized that he was already lying flat behind that\nancient block of rock.\n\nRog Tanlu was on his knees. He had jerked that fountain-pen affair into\naction. Again and again I saw its belching bar of whiteness blast down\ntoward the entrance. This man from the Past, despite his thin, pale\nface and affable manner, was also a fighter!\n\nAnd strangely, watching him and that wildly cavorting shadow that was\nEyoaoc Eiioiei, I forgot all about the automatic in my pocket. For\nsomehow this fantastic meeting of forces seemed remotely withdrawn from\nthe affairs of Doc Champ and myself--although heaven knows we were\nmixed up in it at that moment close enough!\n\nI do not know for how long that flaming barrage lasted--perhaps only\na moment or so, although it seemed longer. But suddenly it was over.\nDarkness and silence blotted down on us there in the cavern.\n\n\"Doc!\" I gasped.\n\nHe didn't answer. But I heard someone moaning softly.\n\nI groped around in the darkness. Then my hand touched him. He didn't\nmove, and somehow it needed only that touch to tell me the truth.\n\n\"Rog Tanlu,\" I called hoarsely. \"Rog Tanlu--!\"\n\n\"Here,\" came a voice, followed by a moan.\n\nThe temporary blindness caused by those recent blasts of light was\nleaving my eyes. I began to see dimly.\n\nI crawled over to where Rog Tanlu was lying.\n\n\"They accomplished their purpose,\" he muttered. \"I--I'm--\"\n\n\"Where are you hurt?\" I asked, my hands running over his shoulder and\narm. That glove-fitting silk garment over his right arm and part of his\nchest felt strangely altered, brittle, charred.\n\n\"The healing ray,\" he muttered. \"The orlex ray--only that could help\nme ... and I know that you do not have it.\"\n\nA sound, the clump of heavy metal feet, caused me suddenly to jerk\nerect. My eyes tried to pierce the darkness.\n\nA grotesque form was emerging from the gloom--Eyoaoc Eiioiei.\n\nI drew back as that metal thing bent over Rog Tanlu.\n\nThere followed a moment of excited voice-sounds, and once or twice Rog\nTanlu answered, faintly, words I could not understand.\n\nSuddenly, reaching down, the thing picked him up in its jointed metal\narms and started to carry him on up the passageway.\n\nFor a moment I stood there, saddened and appalled by this grim turn of\nfate. Then I began running up the slope after them. But so swiftly did\nthat metal thing stride on before me that the blast of glacial air from\nthe Ice Stone was hissing in my ears before I overtook them.\n\n\"Rog Tanlu!\" I cried. \"Where--?\"\n\n\"The healing ray,\" his voice came back to me. \"You do not have it ...\nmy good friend.... But somewhere ... in the Future ... it will be\nrediscovered. Eyoaoc Eiioiei will take me ... on into the Future ...\nthrough the Ice Stone ... again and again if necessary ... until we\nfind it--\"\n\nHis voice ceased. For Eyoaoc Eiioiei had not paused, but had continued\non straight into that frigid blast.\n\nI caught a last vague glimpse of that nightmare shape disappearing into\nthe Ice Stone.\n\n\n\nThere is but little more to tell. Those assassins from the Past\nwere all dead, as I discovered when I left the cavern--Rog Tanlu's\nlaboratory.\n\nI buried what was left of little rawboned Doctor Champ in the sand at\nthe foot of that cliff below the Ice Stone.\n\nThen I headed back in the truck for Qum, the Holy City. Three days\nlater the fuel ran out. I do not know what plans Doc had made for\nreplenishing it, but whatever they were he hadn't put me wise. So I\nleft the truck there at the edge of a mud-salt swamp and went on afoot.\n\nTwo weeks later, more dead than alive, I arrived at Qum and tried to\ngive warning.\n\nIt may seem queer, but until that moment I had not worried over the\nchance of my word being doubted. Moreover, the one substantiating\nexhibit I had thought to bring along--that fawn-colored silk garment of\nRog Tanlu's--I had been forced to abandon along with the truck.\n\nI soon realized that if I persisted in trying to tell the truth, one of\ntwo things would happen: I would either be locked up as a nut, or, if I\nmanaged to convince certain Iranian officials, then the \"Most Lofty of\nLiving Men\"--the Shah--might possibly send a few airplanes out there to\nbomb the Ice Stone \"out of existence,\" as they lightly and humorously\nsuggested.\n\nI doubt that this could be done. If the Ice Stone were dislodged from\nits setting, there in the mountain-cliff where it was installed by its\nmaker--Rog Tanlu--who knows what world-catastrophe might not result?\n\nSo at last I gave up.\n\nAt Bandar Shahpur I caught a boat for home.\n\nBut I am now dickering with a certain Pennsylvania university. They\nare interested in the disappearance of Dr. Champ Chadwick, and I've\noffered to act as guide if they will send a party of scientists out to\ninvestigate the Ice Stone. Perhaps something may come of it--before it\nis too late.\n\nBut then I get to thinking of how Eyoaoc Eiioiei is carrying his\nwounded master on and on into the Future in search of a \"healing ray!\"",
