PAINE\n\n\n\n\nChristmas Eve at Mulligan\u2019s\n\n\nSCENE--The Mulligans\u2019 Living Room\n\n_Discovered_, ROSIE _and_ KATIE\n\nROSIE: Oh, KATIE, don\u2019t you want a doll for Christmas? I want one just\nawful, dreadful, _terrible_ bad--not a bad dolly, but I want it so bad\nthat I just can\u2019t tell you how bad.\n\nKATIE: Now then, ROSIE, ain\u2019t you the naughty girl to be wanting a\ndoll when dear DANNIE is trying to get his eyes well? I don\u2019t want\n_anything_ if he can just be made to see, and you know that takes lots\nof money.\n\nROSIE: Well, I guess I can wish for a dolly--wishing doesn\u2019t cost\nanything, does it? \u2019Course, I don\u2019t mean I want it bought for me; I\njust mean I want it. That isn\u2019t the same, not a bit.\n\nKATIE: Oh, I see! Well, I don\u2019t even _want_ anything, only that DANNIE\ncan get his eyes fixed. Just think, ROSIE, if he could come home able\nto look at us. Wouldn\u2019t that be grand, now?\n\nROSIE: Oh, dear! Oh, boo-hoo-hoo! [_Rubs eyes._] Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo!\n\nKATIE: [_putting arm about her_] W\u2019y, ROSIE, dear, what\u2019s the matter?\nIs it sick you are? Does your stummick hurt, ROSIE?\n\nROSIE: Oh, KATIE, w-w-what if--if-- [_sobs_] DANNIE can see an\u2019 he\ndon\u2019t think I\u2019m pretty? I--I\u2019ve got--freckles on my nose.\n\nKATIE: [_patting her_] Now don\u2019t you be worrying \u2019bout freckles--they\ndon\u2019t hardly show a mite, honest. DANNIE will think you look pretty,\neven if you ain\u2019t, but you are.\n\nROSIE: But I\u2019d like to have my hair all fixed with my nice ribbon an\u2019\nbe dressed up.\n\n        _Enter_ MR. MULLIGAN _who stands at the back listening_\n\nKATIE: Oh, ROSIE, let\u2019s go an\u2019 fix us all up now, just to see how nice\nwe can make us look, just as if it were that DANNIE\u2019S comin\u2019 home\ntonight. That\u2019ll be fun. [_Claps hands and dances about._]\n\nROSIE: Sure, an\u2019 it\u2019ll make us forget that we can\u2019t hang up our\nstockings tonight. An\u2019 I don\u2019t want the doll _very_ bad, KATIE.\n\nKATIE: Indeed you don\u2019t if dear DANNIE comes home so he sees us. Come\non. [_They take hold of hands and run off merrily._]\n\nMULLIGAN: [_coming up to center, shaking head and sighing_] Poor little\ndears, what a pity it is, now, that they\u2019ll not be gittin\u2019 a single\nbit of a Christmas prisint. [_Sits._] But what\u2019s a poor workin\u2019 man\nlike mesilf to do whin Christmas comes round an\u2019 he hasn\u2019t a cint left?\nSure, there\u2019s no father that\u2019s wantin\u2019 to do better by his childer than\nI do, but with all of DANNIE\u2019S ixpenses I\u2019m clean broke.\n\n                         _Enter_ MRS. MULLIGAN\n\nMRS. M.: Now, PETER man, what\u2019s the trouble that\u2019s botherin\u2019 ye so\u2019s\nthat ye look like as if there wasn\u2019t a patch o\u2019 sunshine as big as a\npinhead left in the world? My, my, can\u2019t ye look a bit merrier than\nthis on Christmas eve? An\u2019 whin DANNIE who\u2019s niver looked out of his\neyes all the years he\u2019s lived, bless \u2019im, is gettin\u2019 \u2019em fixed so\u2019s he\ncan see.\n\nMULLIGAN: But NORA darlin\u2019, when a man\u2019s got sich a fine wife an\u2019 sich\nfine childer as I\u2019ve got, an\u2019 likes to do well by \u2019em, it comes awful\nhard not to give \u2019em a bit of a treat at Christmas. [_Sighs._]\n\nMRS. M.: [_putting hand on his shoulder_] Now, PETER, not a bit more of\nthat! We are going to have a wonderful Christmas, just in havin\u2019 DANNIE\ncome home so he can see. Shame to think we need any prisint but that.\n\nMULLIGAN: [_sadly_] Oh, NORA, that\u2019s one thing that\u2019s a botherin\u2019 me. I\nwint over to the hospital tonight \u2019fore I came home an\u2019 they wouldn\u2019t\nlet me see \u2019im, not a-tall a-tall, I\u2019m that worried fer fear he ain\u2019t a\ndoin\u2019 jist right that I scarce know if I\u2019m here or there, sure now.\n\nMRS. M.: [_Shakes head._] Dear, dear! [_Brightens._] But it\u2019s not\nworryin\u2019 we\u2019ll be this night, whin it\u2019s Christmas eve. I\u2019m sure that\nDANNIE is gettin\u2019 along fine. Maybe they\u2019re plannin\u2019 to let \u2019im come\nhome tomorry for a s\u2019prise an\u2019 had to keep \u2019im quiet. Wouldn\u2019t that be\ngrand now?\n\nMULLIGAN: Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s so, NORA. [_Sits with head bowed on hand._]\n\n                           _Enter_ BILL JONES\n\nJONES: Well, well! What\u2019s PETER weepin\u2019 \u2019bout this Christmas eve?\n[_Pulls out big colored handkerchief and wipes_ MULLIGAN\u2019S _eyes_.] I\nbet you\u2019re cryin\u2019 \u2019cause you think Santy won\u2019t bring you any present.\n[_Laughs._]\n\nMULLIGAN: [_Laughs._] Quit pickin\u2019 on a little feller like me. Why\ndon\u2019t you be teasin\u2019 NORA here, if ye wants to pick a quarrel?\n\nJONES: [_pretending fright_] Not the missis--I\u2019ve seen \u2019er bring you to\ntime with the rollin\u2019 pin too often to make \u2019er mad at me.\n\nMRS. M.: [_laughing_] Shame now to speak so whin you know me for the\nbest natured lady that\u2019s standin\u2019 before ye at the prisint time.\n\nJONES: Where\u2019s the two pieces of mischief?\n\nMRS. M.: [_innocently_] An\u2019 who can ye mean?\n\nJONES: I mean those two girls that grow more like their mother ev\u2019ry\nday. They\u2019ve got their father\u2019s beauty an\u2019 their mother\u2019s temper.\n\nMULLIGAN: [_laughing_] Hivin pity \u2019em!\n\nMRS. M.: Now see ye here, BILL JONES, I was goin\u2019 to make ye a nice\ncookie cut in shape of a pig fer a Christmas prisint, but I\u2019ll not do\nit if ye don\u2019t be after quittin\u2019 an\u2019 go to behavin\u2019.\n\nJONES: [_folding hands piously_] If I quit a-tall I\u2019ll have to quit\nbehavin\u2019 \u2019cause I\u2019m always good. My mother says I\u2019m the best boy she\u2019s\ngot--the other six boys bein\u2019 girls. But tell me now, where\u2019s ROSIE an\u2019\nKATIE?\n\nMULLIGAN: Sure, they\u2019re in their room fixin\u2019 up tryin\u2019 to see how nice\nthey can make themselves look \u2019cause they want DANNIE to think they\u2019re\npretty when he sees \u2019em.\n\nMRS. M.: Now what a notion! But still, it\u2019s a good one. DANNIE niver\nhas seen a one of us an\u2019 we\u2019d all ought to look as fine as possible\nwhen he first lays eyes on us.\n\nJONES: Say, if that\u2019s so, I\u2019ll have to go out an\u2019 try to order me a new\nface. No use in tryin\u2019 to fix this one up so\u2019s it\u2019ll look han\u2019some.\n\nMRS. M.: Now, now, MISTER JONES, I know many a lady would think ye\u2019re a\nfine-lookin\u2019 man.\n\nJONES: [_excitedly_] Where\u2019s one of \u2019em? I\u2019ll take \u2019er to the movies\nan\u2019 buy \u2019er a sack of popcorn.\n\nMULLIGAN: I guess I\u2019ll have to brush up some \u2019fore DANNIE comes home.\nI\u2019d like for him to have sort of a likin\u2019 for the looks o\u2019 his homely\nol\u2019 dad.\n\nMRS. M.: You\u2019ll look good to DANNIE, PETER man, an\u2019 I guess wasn\u2019t ye\ncalled one the finest-lookin\u2019 young men in the town when I married ye?\n\nJONES: My, my, how it\u2019s changed \u2019im--livin\u2019 with you, MRS. MULLIGAN.\n\n    _Enter_ ROSIE _and_ KATIE _dressed in white with bright ribbons\n                           and hair flowing_\n\nMRS. M.: [_throwing up hands_] Now, now, who iver did see such\nfine-lookin\u2019 girls. Is it goin\u2019 to a party ye are?\n\nKATIE: Of course not. We\u2019re just trying to see if we could fix so our\nDANNIE\u2019LL think we\u2019re pretty when he sees us. Do you \u2019spose he will?\n\nROSIE: Do you \u2019spose he\u2019ll mind the freckles on my nose when I\u2019ve got\nmy pretty ribbon on?\n\nJONES: [_going close and gazing_] Well, now, I didn\u2019t know you had\nfreckles but I believe there are some here, \u2019bout as big as pancakes.\n\nROSIE: [_slapping him_] Now, you stop teasing me or I\u2019ll tell the\npoliceman on you.\n\nJONES: [_striking attitude_] Who\u2019s \u2019fraid of a policeman? If he says\nanything to me I\u2019ll eat him up.\n\nROSIE: [_pointing finger_] Shame to talk so! Santa Claus won\u2019t bring\nyou any presents if you tell such bad stories.\n\nMULLIGAN: [_sighing_] I guess he won\u2019t bring any of yez a prisint.\nWe\u2019re too poor this year.\n\nKATIE: Now, papa, we don\u2019t want a single present except for DANNIE to\ncome home with his eyes all fixed so he can see us. Won\u2019t that be just\na grand present? [_Dances around the room._]\n\nJONES: I\u2019ll say that\u2019s a fine present. Won\u2019t DANNIE think we\u2019re a\n_h--h--han\u2019some_ family? Hurrah for DANNIE. [_He joins hands with_\nKATIE _and they dance joyously around the room while the others laugh_.]\n\nMRS. M.: We have been savin\u2019 up our earning\u2019s many a long month to git\nDANNIE\u2019S eyes cured if there came a time when the doctor said it could\nbe done. Now he\u2019s had the operation an\u2019 the doctors say they think the\ndear boy is goin\u2019 to see, bless \u2019im, an\u2019 we don\u2019t care, not a little\nmite, \u2019cause it\u2019s taken all our money an\u2019 we can\u2019t have any Christmas\nprisints, do we?\n\nKATIE: No, no, all the present we want is for DANNIE to see.\n\nROSIE: I don\u2019t even care for a doll--if DANNIE won\u2019t think I\u2019m homely.\n\nMRS. M.: I want you all to say: We don\u2019t care for presents if DANNIE\ncan see.\n\nTHE OTHERS: We don\u2019t care for presents if DANNIE can see.\n\nMRS. M.: We don\u2019t care for a Christmas tree if DANNIE can see.\n\nTHE OTHERS: We don\u2019t care for a Christmas tree if DANNIE can see.\n\nMRS. M.: We don\u2019t care for a Christmas dinner if DANNIE can see.\n\nTHE OTHERS: We don\u2019t care for a Christmas dinner if DANNIE can see.\n\nMRS. M.: That\u2019s fine. Now we must remimber that all day tomorrow, which\nwill be Christmas day.\n\nROSIE: Can\u2019t DANNIE come home tomorrow? We want him home Christmas.\n\nMULLIGAN: [_shaking head_] I\u2019m \u2019fraid he\u2019ll not be comin\u2019 fer a bit\nyet. Mebbe he\u2019ll be here for New Year\u2019s.\n\nROSIE: [_clapping hands_] Oh, won\u2019t that be lovely?\n\nJONES: [_to_ MULLIGAN] Say, PETER, an\u2019 s\u2019posin\u2019 DANNIE was to see you\nnow? Why don\u2019t you fuss up some an\u2019 let us see how it improves the\nlooks of you? Put on a necktie f\u2019r instance.\n\nROSIE: Oh, why not ev\u2019rybody fix up an\u2019 we\u2019ll have a party an\u2019 play\ngames. Then we won\u2019t mind \u2019cause we can\u2019t have a Christmas tree.\n\nMRS. M.: That\u2019s not a bad idee, a-tall a-tall.\n\nMULLIGAN: I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 I\u2019d look a mite better fussed up some. [_He and_\nMRS. M. _leave the room_.]\n\nROSIE: Oh, MR. JONES, I think you\u2019d look nice with your hair parted in\nthe middle, like the clerk in the store where mama buys things. I know\nDANNIE would like to see you with it that way. Won\u2019t you let me fix it?\n\nJONES: My hair parted in the middle? Say, now, ROSIE, do you want to\nfix me so they\u2019ll steal me an\u2019 put me in the animal show at the circus?\n\nROSIE: Please let me try it. [_She runs off._ JONES _sits down meekly\nand sighs_.]\n\nKATIE: [_laughing_] Maybe you\u2019ll look so han\u2019some somebody\u2019ll fall in\nlove with you.\n\nJONES: If that\u2019s the case the sooner she fixes it the better.\n\n                       _Enter_ ROSIE _with comb_\n\nROSIE: Now you\u2019re going to look terrible nice.\n\nJONES: Yes, terrible, but not nice. [ROSIE _fusses with his hair until\nshe gets it parted in the middle to suit her; he sits making faces at\nwhich the girls laugh_.]\n\nKATIE: W\u2019y, you _do_ look nice.\n\n      _Enter_ MULLIGAN _and_ MRS. M. _each considerably fixed up_\n\nMRS. M.: [_throwing up her hands_] My, my! Who\u2019s this han\u2019some man?\n[_Laughs as she looks at_ JONES.]\n\nKATIE: He\u2019s got his hair fixed so he\u2019ll look nice when DANNIE comes.\n\nMULLIGAN: Well, now we\u2019re all fussed up, what shall we do nixt?\n\nJONES: [_looking at clock_] I know. You all go in the kitchen an\u2019 stay\nwhile I hide Christmas nuts and candies around the room. When I clap my\nhands three times you are to come in and see how many you can find.\n\nROSIE: Oh, goody! I knew you\u2019d do something nice if I parted your hair\nin the middle.\n\nKATIE: That will be lots of fun. Come on. [_They all start._]\n\nJONES: Now, don\u2019t you come in till I clap my hands, an\u2019 if you dare\nto peek you can\u2019t hunt any nuts an\u2019 candy. Off with you. [MULLIGAN,\nMRS. M. _and the girls exeunt_.] Now, where is that stuff? [_Stands\nthinking, looking off at side._ MISS HAGEN, _in nurse\u2019s costume,\nappears cautiously at side and peeps in_. JONES _puts finger on lips\nfor silence and goes over. They whisper, then both go off._]\n\n            _Enter_ JONES _and_ MISS HAGEN, _helping_ DANNIE\n                             _between them_\n\n[JONES _moves easy chair silently to middle of room and they seat_\nDANNIE _in it and take off his coat and cap. Nurse fixes his hair and\ntie, then she stands at one side of room_, JONES _at the other and\nclaps his hands loudly, three times_.]\n\n                  _Enter_ ROSIE, _running in quickly_\n\nROSIE: I\u2019m going to find--oh, _oh_, OH!! [_Stops and looks at_ DANNIE.]\n\n                      _Enter_ KATIE _very quickly_\n\nKATIE: Did you find--oh, oh, _oh_, OH! [_Stops by_ ROSIE, _gazing_.]\n\n                    _Enter_ MR. _and_ MRS. MULLIGAN\n\nMRS. M.: My, my! Such noisy-- [_Screams._] Oh,--w\u2019y-- [_Runs to_\nDANNIE.]\n\nMULLIGAN: It\u2019s--DANNIE!\n\nMRS. M.: It IS--DANNIE. [_Runs and kisses him._]\n\nKATIE: [_clapping hands_] It\u2019s DANNIE.\n\nROSIE: [_dancing up and down_] Our own DANNIE! [ROSIE _and_ KATIE\n_stand close by him_.]\n\nDANNIE: [_looking from one to another_] It\u2019s the same bad boy himself.\n\nNURSE: [_coming over_] Yes, it is DANNIE, and he has come to enjoy\nChristmas eve with you. If you are real glad to see him he is going to\nstay for Christmas day, too.\n\nMULLIGAN: Oh, DANNIE, can--you-- [_Chokes and wipes eyes._]\n\nMRS. M.: [_kneeling beside him_] Oh, DANNIE dear, can you--see? [_Wipes\neyes_.]\n\nDANNIE: [_looking from one to another and wiping eyes_] I--I--\n\nNURSE: [_happily_] Of course he can see. His eyes aren\u2019t strong yet but\nsoon he will see as well as the rest of you.\n\nMULLIGAN: Thank God! [_Wipes eyes_.]\n\nMRS. M.: Oh, DANNIE, DANNIE! [_Bows head on_ DANNIE\u2019S _knees_.]\n\nKATIE: DANNIE, can you see me?\n\nROSIE: [_anxiously_] DANNIE, you can\u2019t see that I have--have--\n\nJONES: [_coming over and interrupting_] Say now, DANNIE, can you see\nwell enough to tell that ROSIE has red hair?\n\nROSIE: I never have, have I, DANNIE?\n\nDANNIE: [_who has been looking from one to the other_] Mother darlin\u2019,\nhold up yer head so\u2019s I can see you. [_She looks at him wiping her\neyes._] I always knew you were beautiful. [MRS. M. _rises_.]\n\nMULLIGAN: She is that, DANNIE. [_He leans on back of_ DANNIE\u2019S\n_chair_.]\n\nJONES: [_striking attitude_] Now DANNIE, ain\u2019t I han\u2019some too? [_Puffs\nout cheeks, and makes pop eyes. Others laugh._]\n\nNURSE: DANNIE has had the bandages off his eyes part of the time for\nseveral days but we did not let you know because he wanted to give\nyou a happy Christmas surprise. Tomorrow is going to be the merriest\nChristmas he ever has had and I\u2019m sure the rest of you will be happy\nbecause he can see you all.\n\nMULLIGAN: Sure we will that.\n\nKATIE: And we don\u2019t want any other present except to have DANNIE see.\n\nROSIE: I don\u2019t even want a doll, I\u2019m so glad to have DANNIE get his\neyes.\n\nMRS. M.: [_briskly_] Oh, Nurse, dear, here we all stand so excited\nabout DANNIE that we never even ask you to sit down. PETER, where\u2019s\nyour manners, man? [JONES _politely places chair for nurse_.]\n\nMULLIGAN: On the top shelf of the cupboard in a chiny tay-cup.\n\nROSIE: Shall I get them for you, papa? [_Others laugh._]\n\nMULLIGAN: No, I\u2019m that upset over DANNIE that I can\u2019t make use of \u2019em\nyet awhile. [MRS. MULLIGAN _arranges chairs and all sit except the two\ngirls, who lean against the back of_ DANNIE\u2019S _chair_.]\n\nDANNIE: [_who has continued to look at one after another_] Why didn\u2019t\nyou folks ever tell me that I belonged to such a nice-lookin\u2019 fam\u2019ly?\n\nJONES: That\u2019s what I say. Why didn\u2019t anyone tell him what a han\u2019some\nfellow I am? I\u2019ll not stay here, I\u2019m that put out about it. [_Slips\nfrom room._]\n\nMULLIGAN: Now this would be a grand Christmas eve if I jest had a few\nprisints for yez all. All the years we\u2019ve been keepin\u2019 house, NORA,\nthis is the first time I haven\u2019t given you a Christmas treat.\n\nNURSE: Oh, I\u2019m sure this is the finest treat you\u2019ve ever given them,\nMR. MULLIGAN, to be able to have DANNIE\u2019S eyes treated.\n\nMULLIGAN: [_shaking head sadly_] But Christmas ain\u2019t Christmas without\nthe treat.\n\n                   _Enter_ JONES _with large basket_\n\nJONES: What\u2019s that about a Christmas treat? Well, here it comes. I met\nSanty Claus down on the corner an\u2019 he said a fam\u2019ly who did so well\nsavin\u2019 up money to get a boy\u2019s eyes fixed must have a little pay for\nit. NURSE, you might help me give these out. [_He puts basket on chair,\ntakes out packages and hands to_ NURSE _who gives them to family_.]\n\nROSIE: Oh, goody!\n\nMRS. M.: Now, such a man!\n\nJONES: Something for-- [_studies over name_] PETER MULLIGAN. Well,\nhe don\u2019t deserve it but let him have it, NURSE. This is for--well,\nwell--ROSIE. Queer that Santy remembered her when she\u2019s so full of\nmischief. And this is for--KATIE who\u2019s another one full of mischief.\nHere\u2019s a package for--MRS. MULLIGAN an\u2019 she\u2019s to wear it on Christmas\nday. Now here is something for DANNIE who has been a good boy while his\neyes were being made well. This is for-- [_pretends to study name_]\nw\u2019y, it\u2019s for the good NURSE who has taken care of DANNIE. Here [_peeks\ninto bag_] is some Christmas candy, but mind you, KATIE and ROSIE, that\nyou don\u2019t make yourselves sick. Here [_peeps into bag_] are some nuts\nto go with the candy. Here at the bottom of the basket is something\nthat I believe is for me--a nice, fat chicken for Christmas dinner.\n\nROSIE: [_who has unwrapped her package_] Oh, oh, _two_ dolls!\n\nNURSE: Isn\u2019t that nice to have twins?\n\nKATIE: I have a pretty string of beads.\n\nDANNIE: And I have a book with splendid pictures. Won\u2019t it be grand to\nbe able to see them? Christmas is getting better ev\u2019ry minute. I didn\u2019t\nknow anybody could be so happy.\n\nNURSE: My present is a nice box of candy. I certainly thank Santa\nClaus. [_Bows to Jones._]\n\nKATIE: I think it\u2019s sweet candy for a sweet lady.\n\nJONES: [_aside_] That\u2019s what I think only I don\u2019t dare say so.\n\nMRS. M.: I know I\u2019ll look nice, if I do say so myself as\nshouldn\u2019t--wearing this lovely collar tomorrow. My, my, how happy we\nare. Just as soon as tomorrow morning comes, KATIE, you an\u2019 ROSIE must\nrun over with some of the nuts an\u2019 candy for the FLEMMING childers,\npoor little dears.\n\nROSIE: Oh, mama, can\u2019t I take one of my dolls to little MARY? I know\nshe won\u2019t get any.\n\nMULLIGAN: Sure, that will be fine, ROSIE.\n\nNURSE: The best thing about Christmas is to be able to share our joys\nwith someone else. [_Knock is heard_; KATIE _runs over and ushers in\nthe visitors_.]\n\n       _Enter_ MRS. O\u2019BRIEN _and_ PATSY, _each carrying a basket_\n\nMRS. O\u2019B.: [_stopping short_] Well, now, see who\u2019s here? Is it DANNIE\nhimself?\n\nPATSY: I\u2019ll be blessed! It\u2019s sure DANNIE. You young scamp, you, what\u2019d\nyou come home like this for without letting us know?\n\nDANNIE: [_laughing_] Isn\u2019t it the fine Christmas joke I played?\n\nPATSY: Just for that, you brazen scallawag, I\u2019m a good notion to take\nmy Christmas basket back home an\u2019 never let yez have a peep at what\u2019s\nin it. [MRS. O\u2019BRIEN _and_ PATSY _set down their baskets and shake\nhands with_ DANNIE; MRS. O\u2019BRIEN _kisses him and_ PATSY _pats him on\nthe shoulder_.]\n\nROSIE: An\u2019 DANNIE can see, he can.\n\nDANNIE: Yes, I sure can see. MRS. O\u2019BRIEN, you\u2019ve got on [_he gives\nsome items about her dress and hat_] an\u2019 it\u2019s nice lookin\u2019 you are, but\nnot so han\u2019some as me mother.\n\nMRS. M.: Now, now, DANNIE, to talk so to MRS. O\u2019BRIEN. [_She places\nchairs for the_ O\u2019BRIEN\u2019S.]\n\nMRS. O\u2019B.: Niver ye mind, DANNIE, when I\u2019m out with a bunch o\u2019 han\u2019some\nwimmen on a pitch black night I\u2019m as good-lookin\u2019 as any of \u2019em.\n\nDANNIE: Tomorrow when I eat Christmas dinner I can see what ev\u2019rything\nlooks like.\n\nPATSY:\n\n  Little DANNIE MULLIGAN\u2019LL sit at the table,\n    Eating Christmas cake an\u2019 pies;\n  He\u2019ll pull out a plum on the end o\u2019 his thumb,\n    An\u2019 look at it with his new eyes.\n\nDANNIE: [_laughing_] An\u2019 won\u2019t it be the best dinner I\u2019ve ever had?\n\nMRS. O\u2019B.: It sure will, DANNIE, an\u2019 let me tell yez that the very\nreason it\u2019s goin\u2019 to be so good is \u2019cause I\u2019ve brought yez over some\nfine eatybles in these baskets from mesilf an\u2019 some of the other\nneighbors as wanted to show our tinder affection for the MULLIGANS.\n\nNURSE: Isn\u2019t that splendid, DANNIE, to have such lovely friends? I call\nit fine to be remembered this way when you\u2019ve been having such a hard\ntime.\n\nMULLIGAN: I call it fine to be helped out when things have been bad for\nus in money matters. Me pocketbook has got so flat, payin\u2019 DANNIE\u2019S\nbills that I didn\u2019t have the where-with to buy a Christmas dinner.\n\nMRS. M.: But now, praise be to our good friends, we can ask poor MRS.\nDUGAN an\u2019 little JIMMIE over for dinner with us.\n\nDANNIE: That will be fine.\n\nPATSY: Sure, now, I most forgot there\u2019s some candy here that\u2019s to be\neaten on Christmas eve or it won\u2019t taste good a-tall a-tall. [_He gets\na sack from his basket and passes around candy, each one taking a stick\nwhich they begin eating._]\n\nJONES: DANNIE, does candy taste better when you can see it?\n\nDANNIE: It does that.\n\nMRS. M.: I\u2019d sure like to make a nice speech to thank these kind\nfri\u2019nds fer all this Christmas joy they\u2019ve gone an\u2019 brought to us, but\nme heart\u2019s so full I can\u2019t.\n\nJONES: I\u2019d be glad to make it for you, MRS. MULLIGAN, but my _mouth_ is\ntoo full--of candy. [_Pops a piece into his mouth._]\n\nPATSY: We don\u2019t want any thanks. Christmas is the time whin we do\nthings fer the pleasure o\u2019 doin\u2019 \u2019em. An\u2019 we\u2019re that glad \u2019bout DANNIE\nwe feel like doin\u2019 a whole lot more.\n\n  Of all the merry Christmas days\n  That DANNIE ever did see,\n  Tomorrow\u2019ll be the best, you\u2019ll see,\n  Of any he ever did see,\n  \u2019Cause DANNIE can see, you see.\n\nMRS. O\u2019B.: Now, PATSY, do be quittin\u2019 makin\u2019 up such foolishniss in yer\nsilly head. Santy Claus won\u2019t be after bringin\u2019 ye any prisint if ye\ndon\u2019t behave.\n\nPATSY:\n\n  Little PATSY,--watsy--wause,\n  Didn\u2019t git nothin\u2019 from Santy Claus. Ha, ha!\n\nKATIE: Let\u2019s play a game.\n\nJONES: We used to play a game called \u201cKiss the Cook.\u201d When someone like\nMRS. O\u2019BRIEN had made some Christmas cookies or cakes, the one who\nchased her an\u2019 stole a kiss got some of her baking to eat. [_Others\nlaugh._] Now I\u2019m going to steal a kiss from MRS. O\u2019BRIEN an\u2019 get a\ncookie.\n\nMRS. O\u2019BRIEN: [_jumping up_] Indade, ye\u2019ll not kiss me, MISTER JONES.\n[_She starts to run around the room as fast as she can go_, JONES\n_after her, the others cheering them and laughing_. KATIE _and_ _Rosie_\n_dance about and clap their hands_. JONES _bumps into a chair and falls\nonto the floor_.]\n\nDANNIE: That\u2019s the first race I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nMRS. O\u2019B.: I know it\u2019s sorry ye are to lose the kiss, MISTER JONES, so\nI\u2019ll be after givin\u2019 ye a cookie. [_She gives him one from her basket._]\n\nNURSE: Now, DANNIE, it is getting time for a tired boy to go to sleep,\nso we\u2019ll have our song.\n\nDANNIE: Oh, yes.\n\nNURSE: DANNIE and I wrote this song for you to sing on Christmas eve.\nWe want you all to help. [_She gives out pieces of paper with the\nwords._] It goes this way. [_She hums the tune of \u201cYankee Doodle.\u201d_]\nLet\u2019s stand by DANNIE to sing. [KATIE _and_ ROSIE _kneel in front of\nhim; his father and mother stand back of him_; MRS. O\u2019BRIEN _and_ NURSE\n_on one side_, PATSY _and_ JONES _on the other. They sing_]:\n\n  Once DANNIE\u2019S eyes were shut up tight,\n    He could not see a mite, sir;\n  The doctor fixed them good as new,\n    And DANNIE got his sight, sir.\n  Merry, merry Christmas day,\n    DANNIE now can see, sir;\n  He has brought home two good eyes,\n    He\u2019s happy as can be, sir.\n\nMULLIGAN: That\u2019s fine! Let\u2019s sing it again. [_They sing it still more\nlustily._]\n\nMRS. O\u2019B.: \u2019Tis home we must be goin\u2019 an\u2019 we wish the MULLIGANS a\nsplendid merry Christmas.\n\nMRS. M.: Peace an\u2019 goodwill on earth an\u2019 a merry Christmas to ev\u2019rybody.\n\n\nCURTAIN\n\n\n\n\nObvious typographical errors have been silently corrected.
