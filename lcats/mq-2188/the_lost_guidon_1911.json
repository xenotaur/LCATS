    "body": "By Charles Egbert Craddock\n\n1911\n\n\nNight came early. It might well seem that day had fled affrighted. The\nheavy masses of clouds, glooming low, which had gathered thicker and\nthicker, as if crowding to witness the catastrophe, had finally shaken\nasunder in the concussions of the air at the discharges of artillery,\nand now the direful rain, always sequence of the shock of battle, was\nsteadily falling, falling, on the stricken field. Many a soldier who\nmight have survived his wounds would succumb to exposure to the elements\nduring the night, debarred the tardy succor that must needs await his\nturn. One of the surgeons at their hasty work at the field hospital,\nunder the shelter of the cliffs on the slope, paused to note the presage\nof doom and death, and to draw a long breath before he adjusted himself\nanew to the grim duties of the scalpel in his hand. His face was set and\nhaggard, less with a realization of the significance of the scene--for\nhe was used to its recurrence--than simply with a physical reflection of\nhorror, as if it were glassed in a mirror. A phenomenon that had earlier\ncaught his attention in the landscape appealed again to his notice,\nperhaps because the symptom was not in his line.\n\n\"Looks like a case of dementia,\" he observed to the senior surgeon,\nstanding near at hand.\n\nThe superior officer adjusted his field-glass. \"Looks like 'Death on the\nWhite Horse'!\" he responded.\n\nDown the highway, at a slow pace, rode a cavalryman wearing a gray\nuniform, with a sergeant's chevrons, and mounted on a steed good in his\nday, but whose day was gone. A great clot of blood had gathered on his\nbroad white chest, where a bayonet had thrust him deep. Despite his\nexhaustion, he moved forward at the urgency of his rider's heel and\nhand. The soldier held a long, heavy staff planted on one stirrup,\nfrom the top of which drooped in the dull air the once gay guidon,\nbattle-rent and sodden with rain, and as he went he shouted at\nintervals, \"Dovinger's Bangers! Rally on the guidon!\" Now and again\nhis strident boyish voice varied the appeal, \"Hyar's yer Dov-inger's\nRangers! Bally, boys! Rally on the reserve!\"\n\nIndeed, despite his stalwart, tall, broad-shouldered frame, he was\nscarcely more than a boy. His bare head had flaxen curls like a child's;\nhis pallid, though sunburned face was broad and soft and beardless; his\nlarge blue eyes were languid and spiritless, though now and then as he\nturned an intent gaze over the field they flared anew with hope, as if\nhe expected to see rise up from that desolate expanse, from among the\nstiffening carcasses of horses and the stark corpses of the troopers,\nthat gallant squadron wont to follow, so dashing and debonair, wherever\nthe guidons might mark the way. But there was naught astir save the\ndarkness slipping down by slow degrees--and perchance under its cloak,\nalready stealthily afoot, the ghoulish robbers of the dead that haunt\nthe track of battle. They were the human forerunners of the vulture\nbreed, with even a keener scent for prey, for as yet the feathered\ncarrion-seekers held aloof; two or three only were descried from the\nfield hospital, perched on the boughs of a dead tree near the river,\npresently joined by another, its splendid sustained flight impeded\nsomewhat by the rain, battling with its big, strong wings against the\ndownpour of the torrents and the heavy air.\n\nAnd still through all echoed the cry, \"Rally on the guidon! Dovinger's\nRangers! Rally on the reserve!\"\n\nThe bridge that crossed the river, which was running full and foaming,\nhad been burnt; but a span, charred and broken, still swung from the\ncentral pier. Over toward the dun-tinted west a house was blazing, fired\nby some stray bomb, perhaps, or by official design, to hinder the enemy\nfrom utilizing the shelter, and its red rage of destruction bepainted\nthe clouds that hung so low above the chimneys and dormer-windows. To\nthe east, the woods on the steeps had been shelled, and a myriad boughs\nand boles riven and rent, lay in fantastic confusion. Through the\nmournful chaos the wind had begun to sweep; it sounded in unison with\nthe battle clamors, and shrieked and wailed and roared as it surged\nadown the defiles. Now and then there came on the blast the fusillade\nof dropping shots from the south, where the skirmish line of one\nfaction engaged the rear-guard of the other, or the pickets fell within\nrifle-range. Once the sullen, melancholy boom of distant cannon shook\nthe clouds, and then was still, and ever and again sounded that tireless\ncry, \"Dovinger's Rangers. Hyar's yer guidon! Rally, boys! Rally on the\nguidon! Rally on the reserve!\"\n\nThe senior surgeon, as the road wound near, stepped down toward it\nwhen the horseman, still holding himself proudly erect, passed by.\n\"Sergeant,\" he hailed the guidon, \"where is Captain Dovinger?\"\n\nThe hand mechanically went to the boy's forehead in the usual military\nsalute. \"Killed, sir.\"\n\n\"Where are the other officers of the squadron--the junior captain, the\nlieutenants?\"\n\n\"Killed, sir.\"\n\n\"What has become of the troopers?\"\n\n\"Killed, sir, in the last charge.\"\n\nThere was a pause. Then Dr. Trent broke forth: \"Are you a fool, boy? If\nyour command is annihilated, why do you keep up this commotion?\"\n\nThe young fellow looked blank for a moment. Then, as if he had not\nreasoned on the catastrophe: \"I thought at first they monght be\nscattered--some of 'em. But ef--ef--they _war_ dead, but could once\n_see_ the guidon, sure 't would call 'em to life. They _couldn't_ be\nso dead but they would rally to the guidon! Guide right!\" he shouted\nsuddenly. \"Dovinger's Rangers! Rally on the guidon, boys! Rally on the\nreserve!\"\n\nIt was a time that hardened men's hearts. The young soldier had no\nphysical hurt that might appeal to the professional sympathies of the\nsenior surgeon, and he turned away with a half laugh. \"Let him go\nalong! He can't rally Dovinger's Rangers this side of the river Styx, it\nseems.\"\n\nBut an old chaplain who had been hovering about the field hospital,\nwhispering a word here and there to stimulate the fortitude of the\nwounded and solace the fears of the dying, recognized moral symptoms\nalien to any diagnosis of which the senior surgeon was capable. The\nlatter did not deplore the diversion of interest, for the old man's\npresence was not highly esteemed by the hospital corps at this scene of\nhasty and terrible work, although, having taken a course in medicine in\nearly life, he was permitted to aid in certain ways. But the surgeons\nwere wont to declare that the men began to bleat at the very sight of\nthe chaplain. So gentle, so sympathetic, so paternal, was he that they\nmade the more of their wretched woes, seeing them so deeply deplored.\nThe senior surgeon, moreover, was not an ardent religionist. \"This is no\ntime for a revival, Mr. Whitmel,\" he would insist. \"Jack, there, never\nspoke the name of God in his life, except to swear by it. He is too late\nfor prayers, and if _I_ can't pull him through, he is a goner!\" But the\nchaplain was fond of quoting:\n\n     \"Between the stirrup and the ground\n     He mercy sought and mercy found----\"\n\nand sometimes the scene was irreverently called a \"love feast\" when\nsome hard-riding, hard-swearing, hard-fighting, unthinking sinner went\njoyfully out of this world from the fatherly arms of the chaplain into\nthe paternal embrace of an eternal and merciful Father, as the man of\nGod firmly believed.\n\nHe stood now, staring after the guidon borne through the rain and the\nmist, flaunting red as the last leaves of autumn against the dun-tinted\ndusk, that the dead might view the gallant and honored pennant and rise\nagain to its leading!\n\nNo one followed but the tall, thin figure of the gaunt old chaplain,\nunless indeed the trooping shadows that kept him company had\nmysteriously roused at the stirring summons. Lanterns were now visible,\ndimly flickering in one quarter where the fighting had been furious and\nthe slain lay six deep on the ground. Their aspirations, their valor,\ntheir patriotism, had all exhaled--volatile essences, these incomparable\nvalues!--and now their bodies, weighted with death, cumbered the earth.\nThey must be hurried out of sight, out of remembrance soon, and the\nburial parties were urged to diligence at the trenches where these\ncast-off semblances were to lie undistinguished together. And still the\nreflection of the burning house reddened the gloomy west, and still the\ncry, \"Rally on the guidon! Dovinger's Rangers!\" smote the thick air.\n\nSuddenly it was silent. The white horse that had been visible in the\nflare from the flaming house, now and again flung athwart the landscape,\nno longer loomed in the vista of the shadowy road. He had given way at\nlast, sinking down with that martial figure still in the saddle, and,\nwith no struggle save a mere galvanic shiver, passing away from the\nscene of his faithful devoirs.\n\nFatigue, agitation, anguish, his agonized obsession of the possibility\nof rallying the squadron, had served to prostrate the soldier's physical\npowers of resistance. He could not constrain his muscles to rise from\nthe recumbent position against the carcass. He started up, then sank\nback, and in another moment triumphant nature conquered, and he was\nasleep--a dull, dreamless sleep of absolute exhaustion, that perchance\nrescued his reason as well as saved his life.\n\nThe old chaplain was a man of infinite prejudice, steeped in all the\ninfirmities and fantasies of dogma; a lover of harmony, and essentially\nan apostle of peace. Nevertheless, it would not have been physically\nsafe to call him a Jesuit. But indeed he scarcely hesitated; he stepped\nover the great inert bulk of the dead horse, unclenched the muscular\ngrasp of the soldier, as if it had been a baby's clasp, slipped the\nstaff, technically the lance, of the guidon from its socket, and stood\nwith it in his own hand, looking suspiciously to and fro to descry if\nperchance he were observed. The coast clear, he turned to the wall\nof rock beside the road, for this was near the mountain sandstone\nformation, fissured, splintered, with the erosions of water and weather;\nand into one of the cellular, tunnel-like apertures he ran the guidon,\nlance and all,--lost forever from human sight.\n\nIn those days one might speak indeed of the march of events. Each seemed\nhard on the heels of its precursor. Change ran riot in the ordering of\nthe world, and its aspect was utterly transformed when Casper Girard,\nno longer bearing the guidon of Dovinger's Rangers, came out of the war\nwith a captain's shoulder-straps, won by personal fitness often proved,\nthe habit of command, and a great and growing opinion of himself. He was\na changeling, so to speak. No longer he felt a native of the mountain\ncove where he had been born and reared. He had had a glimpse of\nthe world from a different standpoint, and it lured him. A dreary,\ndisaffected life he led for a time.\n\n\"'Minds me of a wild tur-r-key in a trap,\" his mother was wont to\ncomment. \"Always stretchin' his neck an' lookin' up an' away--when\nhe mought git out by looking down.\" And the simile was so apt that it\nstayed in his mind--looking up and away!\n\nOf all dull inventions, in his estimation the art of printing exceeded.\nHe had made but indifferent progress in education during his early\nyouth; he was a slow and inexpert reader, and a writer whose chirography\nshrank from exhibition. Now, however, a book in the hand gave him a\ncherished sentiment of touch with the larger world beyond those blue\nranges that limited his sphere, and he spent much time in sedulously\nreading certain volumes which he had brought home with him.\n\n\"Spent _money_ fur 'em!\" his mother would ejaculate, contemplating this\nextreme audacity of extravagance.\n\nAs she often observed, \"the plough-handles seemed red-hot,\" and as soon\nas political conditions favored he ran for office. On the strength of\nhis war record, a potent lever in those days, he was elected register\nof the county. True, there was only a population of about fifty souls\nin the county town, and the houses were log-cabins, except the temple\nof justice itself, which was a two-story frame building. But his success\nwas a step on the road to political preferment, and his ambitious eyes\nwere on the future. Into the midst of his quiet incumbency as register\ncame Fate, all intrusive, and found him through the infrequent medium of\na weekly mail. It was at the beginning of the retrospective enthusiasm\nthat has served to revive the memories of the War, and he received a\nletter from an old comrade-in-arms, giving the details of a brigade\nreunion shortly to be held at no great distance, and, being of the\ncommittee, inviting him to be present.\n\nGirard had participated in great military crises; he had marshalled his\ntroop in line of battle; as a mere boy, he had ridden with the guidon\nlance planted on his stirrup, with the pennant flying above his head,\nas the marker to lead the fierce and famous Dov-inger Rangers into the\nthickest of the fight; yet he had never felt such palpitant tremors\nof excitement as when he stood on the hotel piazza of the New Helvetia\nSprings, where the banqueters had gathered, and suffered the ordeal of\nintroduction to sundry groups of fashionable ladies. He had earlier seen\nspecimens of the species in the course of military transitions through\nthe cities of the lowlands, and he watched them narrowly to detect\nif they discerned perchance a difference between him and the men of\neducation and social station with whom his advancement in the army\nhad associated him. He did not reflect that they were too well-bred\nto reveal any appreciation of such incongruity, but he had never\nexperienced a more ardent glow of gratification than upon overhearing a\nfriend's remark: \"Girard is great! Anybody would imagine he was used to\nall this!\"\n\nNo strategist was ever more wary. He would not undertake to dance, for\nhe readily perceived that the gyrations in the ball-room were utterly\ndissimilar to the clumsy capering to which he had been accustomed on the\npuncheon floor of a mountain cabin. He had the less reason for\nregret since he was privileged instead to stroll up and down the\nveranda,--\"promenade\" was the technical term,--a slender hand,\ndelicately gloved, on the sleeve of his gray uniform, the old\nregimentals being _de rigueur_ at these reunions. A white ball-gown,\nsuch as he had never before seen, fashioned of tissue over lustrous\nwhite silk, swayed in diaphanous folds against him, for these were the\ndays of voluminous draperies; a head of auburn hair elaborately dressed\ngleamed in the moonlight near his shoulder. Miss Alicia Duval thought\nhim tremendously handsome; she adored his record, as she would have\nsaid--unaware how little of it she knew--and she did not so much intend\nto flirt as to draw him out, for there was something about him different\nfrom the men of her set, and it stimulated her interest.\n\n\"Isn't the moon heavenly!\" she observed, gazing at the brilliant orb,\nnow near the full, swinging in the sky, which became a definite blue in\nits light above the massive dark mountains and the misty valley below;\nfor the building was as near the brink as safety permitted--nearer, the\ncautious opined.\n\n\"Heavenly? Not more'n it's got a right to be. It's a heavenly body,\nain't it?\" he rejoined.\n\n\"Oh, how sarcastic!\" she exclaimed. \"In what school did you acquire your\ntrenchant style?\"\n\nHe thought of the tiny district school where he had acquired the very\nlittle he knew of aught, and said nothing, laughing constrainedly in\nlieu of response.\n\nThe music of the orchestra came, to them from the ball-room, and the\nrhythmic beat of dancing feet; the wind lifted her hair gently and\nbrought to them the fragrance of flowering plants and the pungent\naroma of mint down in the depths of the ravine hard by, where lurked\na chalybeate spring; but for the noisy rout of the dance, and now and\nagain the flimsy chatter of a passing couple on the piazza, promenading\nlike themselves, they might have heard the waters of the fountain\nrise and bubble and break and sigh as the pulsating impulse beat like\nheart-throbs, and perchance on its rocky marge an oread a-singing.\n\n\"But you don't answer me,\" she pouted with an affectation of\npettishness. \"Do you know that you trouble yourself to talk very little,\nCaptain Girard!\"\n\n\"I think the more,\" he declared.\n\n\"Think? Oh, dear me! I didn't know that anybody does anything so\nunfashionable nowadays as to _think!_ And what do you think about,\npray?\"\n\n\"About you!\"\n\nAnd that began it: he was a gallant man, and he had been a brave one. He\nwas not aware how far he was going on so short an acquaintance, but\nhis temerity was not displeasing to the lady. She liked his manner of\nstorming the citadel, and she did not realize that he merely spoke at\nrandom, as best he might. He was in his uniform a splendid and martial\npresentment of military youth, and indeed he was much the junior of his\ncompeers.\n\n\"Who are Captain Girard's people, Papa?\" she asked Colonel Duval next\nmorning, as the family party sat at breakfast in quasi seclusion at\none of the small round tables in the crowded dining-room, full of the\nchatter of people and the clatter of dishes.\n\n\"Girard?\" Colonel Duval repeated thoughtfully. \"I really don't know. I\nhave an impression they live somewhere in East Tennessee. I never met\nhim till just about the end of the war.\"\n\n\"Oh, Papa! How unsatisfactory you are! You never know anything about\nanybody.\"\n\n\"I should think his people must be very plain,\" said Mrs. Duval. Her\nsocial discrimination was extremely acute and in constant practice.\n\n\"I don't know why. He is very much of a gentleman,\" the Colonel\ncontended. His heart was warm to-day with much fraternizing, and it was\nnot kind to brush the bloom off his peach.\n\n\"Oh, trifles suggest the fact. He is not at all _au fait_.\"\n\nHe was, however, experienced in ways of the world unimagined in her\nphilosophy. The reunion had drawn to a close, ending in a flare of\njollity and tender reminiscence and good-fellowship. The old soldiers\nwere all gone save a few regular patrons of the hotel, who with their\nfamilies were completing their summer sojourn. Captain Girard lingered,\ntoo, fascinated by this glimpse of the frivolous world, hitherto\nunimagined, rather than by the incense to his vanity offered by his\nfacile acceptance as a squire of dames. For the first time in his life\nhe felt the grinding lack of money. Being a man of resource, he set\nabout swiftly supplying this need. In the dull days of inaction, when\nthe armies lay supine and only occasionally the monotony was broken by\nthe engagement of distant skirmishers or a picket line was driven in on\nthe main body, he had learned to play a game at cards much in vogue\nat that period, though for no greater hazards than grains of corn or\nConfederate money, almost as worthless. In the realization now that the\nsame principles held good with stakes of value, he seemed to enter upon\nthe possession of a veritable gold mine. The peculiar traits that his\none unique experience of the world had developed--his coolness, his\ncourage, his discernment of strategic resources--stood him in good\nstead, and long after the microcosm of the hotel lay fast asleep the\ncards were dealt and play ran high in the little building called the\ncasino, ostensibly devoted to the milder delights of billiards and\ncigars.\n\nEither luck favored him or he had rare discrimination of relative\nchances in the run of the cards, or the phenomenally bold hand he played\ndisconcerted his adversaries, but his almost invariable winning began\nto affect injuriously his character. Indeed, he was said to be a rook\nof unrivalled rapacity. Colonel Duval was in the frame of mind that his\nwife called \"bearish\" one morning as his family gathered for breakfast\nin the limited privacy of their circle about the round table in the\ndining-room.\n\n\"I want you to avoid that fellow, Alicia,\" he growled _sotto voce_, as\nhe intercepted a bright matutinal smile that the fair Alicia sent as a\nmorning greeting to Girard, who had just entered and taken his seat at a\ndistance. \"We know nothing under heaven about his people, and he himself\nhas the repute of being a desperate gambler.\"\n\nHis wife raised significant eyebrows. \"If that is true, why should he\nstay in this quiet place?\"\n\nColonel Duval experienced a momentary embarrassment. \"Oh, the place is\nright enough. He stays, no doubt, because he likes it. You might as well\nask why old Mr. Whitmel stays here.\"\n\n\"The idea of mentioning a clergyman in this connection!\"\n\n\"Mr. Whitmel is professionally busy,\" cried Alicia. \"He told me that he\nis studying 'the disintegration of a soul.' I hope it is not _my_ soul.\"\n\nThe phrase probably interested Alicia in her idleness, for she was\ncertainly actuated by no view of a moral uplift in the character of\nGirard, the handsome gambler. She did not recognize a subtle cruelty in\nher system of universal fascination, but her vanity demanded constant\ntribute, and she was peculiarly absorbed in the effort to bring to her\nfeet this man of iron, her knight in armor, as she was wont to call him,\nto control him with her influence, to bend this unmalleable material\nlike the proverbial wax in her hands. She had great faith in the\ncoercive power of her hazel eyes, and she brought their batteries to\nbear on Girard on the first occasion when she had him at her mercy.\n\n\"I have heard something about you which is very painful,\" she said one\nday as they sat together beside the chalybeate spring. The crag, all\ndiscolored in rust-red streaks by the dripping of the mineral water\nthrough its interstices, towered above their heads; the ferns, exquisite\nand of subtle fragrance, tufted the niches; the trees were close about\nthem, and below, on the precipitous slope; sometimes the lush green\nboughs parted, revealing a distant landscape of azure ranges, far\nstretching against a sky as blue, and in the valley of the foreground\nlong bars of golden hue, where fields, denuded of the harvested wheat,\ntook the sun. Girard lounged, languid, taciturn, and quiescent as ever,\non the opposite side of the circular rock basin wherein the clear water\nfell.\n\n\"I will tell you what it is,\" Alicia went on, after a pause, for, though\nhe looked attentive, he gave not even a glance of question. \"I hear that\nyou gamble.\"\n\nHis gaze concentrated as he knitted his brows, but he said nothing.\n\nShe pulled her broad straw hat forward on her auburn hair and readjusted\nthe flounces of her white morning dress, saying while thus engaged,\n\"Yes, indeed; that you gamble--like--like fury!\"\n\n\"Why, don't you know that's against the law?\" he demanded unexpectedly.\n\n\"I know that it is very wrong and sinful,\" she said solemnly.\n\n\"Thanky. I'll put that in my pipe an' smoke it! I'm very wrong and\nsinful, I am given to understand.\"\n\n\"Why, I didn't mean _you_ so much,\" she faltered, perturbed by this\nsudden charge of the enemy. \"I meant the practice.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know that I'm a sinner in more ways 'n one; but I _didn't_ know\nthat you were a lady-preacher.\"\n\n\"You mean that it is none of my business----\"\n\n\"You ought to be so glad of that,\" he retorted.\n\nShe maintained a silence that might have suggested a degree of offended\npride, and she was truly humiliated that her vaunted hazel eyes had\nso signally failed to work their wonted charm. As they strolled back\ntogether up the steep path to the hotel he seemed either unobservant\nor uncaring, so impassive were his manners, and she was aware that her\ndemonstration had resulted in giving him information which he could\nnot otherwise have gained. Later, she was nettled to notice that he had\nutilized it in prosaic fashion, for that night no lights flared late\nfrom the casino.\n\nThe gamesters, informed that rumors were a-wing, had betaken themselves\nelsewhere. A small smoking-room in the hotel proper seemed less\nobnoxious to suspicion in the depleted condition of the guest-list,\nsince autumn was now approaching. After eleven o'clock the coterie would\nscarcely be subject to interruption, and there they gathered as the hour\nwaxed late. The cards were duly dealt, the draw was on, when suddenly\nthe door opened and old Mr. Whitmel, his favorite meerschaum in his\nhand and a sheaf of newly arrived journals, entered with the evident\nintention of a prolonged stay. A \"standpatter\" seemed hardly so assured\nas before he encountered the dim, surprised gaze, but the old clergyman\nwas esteemed a good sort, and he ventured on a reminder:\n\n\"You have been here before, haven't you, Mr. Whitmel? Saw a deal of this\nsort of thing in the army!\" And he rattled the chips significantly.\n\n\"Used to see that sort of thing in the army? Yes, yes, indeed--more than\nI wanted to see--very much more!\"\n\nColonel Duval took schooling much amiss. He turned up his florid face\nwith its auburn mustachios and Burnside whiskers from its bending\nover the cards and showed a broad arch of glittering white teeth in an\nungenial laugh.\n\n\"Remember, Mr. Whitmel, at that fight we had in the hills not far from\nthe Ocoee, how you rebuked two artillerymen for swearing? Something was\nwrong with the vent-hole of the piece, and one of the gunners asked what\nbusiness you had with their language; and you said, 'I am a minister of\nthe Lord,' and the fellow gave it back very patly, 'I ain't carin' ef\nyou was a minister of state!' Then you said, 'No, you would doubtless\nswear in the presence of an angel.' And the fellow with the sponge-staff\ndeclared, 'Say, Mister, ef you are _that_, you are an angel off your\nfeed certain'--you were worn to skin and bone then--'an' the rations of\nmanna must be ez skimpy in heaven ez the rations o' bacon down here in\nDixie.' Ha, ha, ha!\"\n\nMr. Whitmel had taken a seat in an easy-chair; he had struck a match and\nwas composedly kindling his pipe. \"I felt nearer a higher communion that\nday than often since,\" he said.\n\nThe coterie of gentlemen looked at one another in disconsolate\nuncertainty, and one turned his cards face downward and laid them\nresignedly on the table. The party was evidently in for one of the old\nchaplain's long stories, with a few words by way of application, and\nthere was no decent opportunity to demur. They were the intruders in the\nsmoking-room--not he! Here with his pipe and his paper, he was within\nthe accommodation assigned him. They must hie them back to the casino to\nbe at ease, and this would they do when he should reach the end of his\nstory--if indeed it had an end.\n\nFor with the prolixity of the eye-witness he was detailing the points of\nthe battle; what troops were engaged; how the flank was turned; how\nthe reserve was delayed; how the guns were planted; how the cavalry was\nordered to charge over impracticable ground, and how in consequence he\nsaw a squadron literally annihilated; how for hours after the fight\nwas over a sergeant of the Dovinger Rangers pervaded the field with the\nguidon, calling on them by name to rally.\n\n\"And, gentlemen,\" he continued, turning in his chair, the fire kindling\nin his eyes as it died in the bowl of his pipe, \"not one man responded,\nfor none could rise from that horrid slaughter.\"\n\nThere was a moment of tense silence. Then, \"Back and forth the guidon\nflaunted, and the rain began to fall, and the night came on, and still\nthe dusk echoed the cry, 'Guide right! Dovinger's Rangers! Rally on the\nguidon! Rally on the reserve!'\"\n\nThe old chaplain stuck his pipe into his mouth and brought it aflare\nagain with two or three strong indrawing respirations.\n\n\"The surgeons said it would end in a case of dementia. I was sorry, for\nI had seen much that day that hurt me, and more than all was this. For\nI could picture that valiant young spirit going through life, spared by\nGod's mercy; and it seemed to me that when the enemy, in whatever guise,\nshould press him hard and defeat should bear him down he would have the\ncourage and the ardor and the moral strength to rally on the reserve. He\nwould rally on the guidon.\"\n\nThe old chaplain pulled strongly at his pipe, setting the blue wreaths\nof smoke circling about his head. \"I should know that young fellow again\nwherever I might chance to see him.\"\n\n\"Did he collapse at last and verify the surgeon's prophecy!\" asked the\ndealer.\n\n\"Well,\" drawled the chaplain, with a little flattered laugh, \"I myself\ntook care of that Many years ago I studied medicine, before I was\nfavored with a higher call. Neurology was my line. When the boy's horse\nsank exhausted beneath him, and he fell into a sleep or stupor on\nthe carcass, I removed the object of the obsession. I slipped the\nflag-staff, guidon and all, into a crevice of the rocks, where it will\nremain till the end of our time, be sure.\" He laughed in relish of his\narbitrary intervention.\n\n\"There was a fine healthy clamor in camp the next morning about the lost\nguidon. But I did the soldier no damage, for he had been promoted to a\nlieutenancy for special gallantry on the field, and he therefore could\nno longer have carried the guidon if he had had both the flag and the\ntroop.\"\n\nThe stories of camp and field, thus begun, swiftly multiplied; they wore\nthe fire to embers, and the oil sank low in the lamps. There was a chill\nsense of dawn in the blue-gray mist when the group, separating at last,\nissued upon the veranda; the moon, so long hovering over the sombre\nmassive mountains, was slowly sinking in the west.\n\nAmong the shadows of the pillars a tall, martial figure lurked in ambush\nfor the old chaplain, as he rounded the corner of the veranda on his way\nto his own quarters.\n\n\"Pa'son,\" a husky voice spoke from out the dim comminglement of the\nmist and the moon, \"'twas me that carried that guidon in Dovinger 's\nBangers.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" declared the triumphant tactician. \"_I_ recognized you as\nsoon as I saw you again.\"\n\n\"I 'm through with this,\" the young mountaineer exclaimed abruptly,\nwith an eloquent gesture of renunciation toward the deserted card-table\nvisible through the vista of open doors. \"I'm going home--to work! I'll\nnever forget that I was marker in Dovinger's Rangers. I carried the\nguidon! And that last day I marked their way to glory! There's nothing\nleft of them except honor and duty, but I'll rally on that, Chaplain.\nNever fear for me, again. I'll rally on the reserve!\"",
