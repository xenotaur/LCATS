the peasant drest.\n    Hee takes a whiffe, with arte into his head,\n    The other standeth still astonished.\n    Till all his sences he doth backe revoake,\n    Sees it ascend much like Saint

had been a firie cole.\n    Which circled round with smoak, seemed to him\n    Like to some rotten brand that burneth dim.\n    But to shew wisdome in a desperat case,\n    He threw a Can of beere into his face,\n    And like a man some furie did inspire,\n    Ran out of doores for helpe to quench the fire.\n    The Ruffin throwes away his Trinidado,\n    Out comes huge oathes and then his short poynado,\n    But then the Beere so troubled his eyes,\n    The countrieman was gone ere he could rise,\n    A fier to drie him, he doth now require,\n    Rather than water for to quench his

If charges eate up such excessive gaine,\n    Well he can shew you some of Lybian gravell,\n    O that there were another world to travell,\n    I heard him sweare that hee (twas in his mirth)\n    Had been in all the corners of the earth.\n    Let all his wonders be together stitcht,\n    He threw the barre that great _Alcides_ pitcht:\n    But he that saw the Oceans farthest strands,\n    You pose him if you aske where Dover stands.\n    He has been under ground and hell did see,\n    _Aeneas_ nere durst goe so farre as hee.\n    For he has gone through _Plut\u0153s_ Regiment,\n    Saw how the Fiendes doe Lyers there torment.\n    And how they did in helles damnation frye,\n    But who would thinke the Traveller would lye?\n    To dine with _Pluto_ he was made to tarrie,\n    As kindly us\u2019d as at his Ordinarie.\n    Hogsheades of wine drawne out into a Tub,\n    Where he did drinke hand-smooth with _Belzebub_,\n    And _Proserpine_ gave him a goulden bow,\n    Tis in his chest he cannot shew it now.\n\n\n\n\n_Of one that cousned the Cut-purse._\n\n\n    One toulde a Drover that beleev\u2019d it not,\n    What booties at the playes the Cut-purse got,\n    But if t\u2019were so my Drovers wit was quicke,\n    He vow\u2019d to serve the Cut-purse a new tricke.\n    Next day unto the play, pollicy hy\u2019d,\n    A bag of fortie shillings by his side,\n    Which houlding fast he taketh up his stand,\n    If stringes be cut his purse is in his hand.\n    A fine conceited Cut-purse spying this,\n    Lookt for no more, the for shillings his,\n    Whilst my fine Politique gazed about,\n    The Cut-purse feately tooke the bottom out.\n    And cuts the strings, good foole goe make a jest,\n    This Dismall day thy purse was fairely blest.\n    Houlde fast good Noddy tis good to dreade the worse,\n    Your monie\u2019s gone, I pray you keepe your purse.\n    The play is done and foorth the foole doth goe,\n    Being glad that he cousned the Cut-purse soe.\n    He thought to jybe how he the Cut-purse drest,\n    And memorize it for a famous jest.\n    But putting in his hand it ran quite throw\n    Dash\u2019t the conceite, heele never speake on\u2019t now,\n    You that to playes have such delight to goe,\n    The Cut-purse cares not, still deceive him so.\n\n\n\n\n_A drunken fray._\n\n\n    _Dicke_ met with _Tom_ in faith it was their lot,\n    Two honest Drunkars must goe drinke a pot,\n    Twas but a pot, or say a little more,\n    Or say a pot that\u2019s filled eight times ore.\n    But being drunke, and met well with the leese,\n    They drinke to healthes devoutly on their knees,\n    _Dicke_ drinks to _Hall_, to pledge him _Tom_ rejects,\n    And scornes to doe it for some odde respects\n    Wilt thou not pledge him thar\u2019t a gill, a Scab,\n    Wert with my man-hood thou deservest a stab,\n    But tis no matter drinke another bout,\n    Weele intot\u2019h field and there weele trie it out.\n    Lets goe (saies Tom) no longer by this hand,\n    Nay stay (quoth Dicke) lets see if we can stand.\n    Then forth they goe after the drunken pace,\n    Which God he knowes was with a reeling grace,\n    _Tom_ made his bargaine, thus with bonnie Dicke\n    If it should chance my foote or so should slip,\n    How wouldst thou use me or after what Size,\n    Wouldst bare me shorter or wouldst let me rise.\n    Nay God forbid our quarrells not so great,\n    To kill thee on advantage in my heat.\n    Tush we\u2019le not fight for any hate or soe,\n    But for meere love that each to other owe.\n    And for thy learning loe Ile shew a tricke,\n    No sooner spoke the worde but downe comes Dicke,\n    Well now (quoth Tom) thy life hangs on my sworde,\n    If I were downe how wouldst thou keepe thy worde?\n    Why with these hilts I\u2019de braine thee at a blow,\n    Faith in my humor cut thy throate, or soe,\n    But Tom he scorne to kill his conquered foe,\n    Lets Dicke arise, and too\u2019t againe they goe.\n    Dicke throwes downe Tom, or rather Tom did fall,\n    My hilts (quoth Dicke) shall braine thee like a maull,\n    Is\u2019t so (quoth Tom) good faith what remedie,\n    The Tower of Babell\u2019s fallen and so am I.\n    But Dicke proceedes to give the fatall wound,\n    It mist his throate, but run into the ground.\n    But he supposing that the man was slaine,\n    Straight fled his contrie, ship himselfe for Spaine,\n    Whilst valiant Thomas dyed dronken deepe,\n    Forgot his danger and fell fast a sleepe.\n\n\n\n\n_Epigram._\n\n\n    What\u2019s he that stares as if he were afright?\n    The fellowe sure hath seene some dreadfull spright\n    Masse rightly guest, why sure I did divine,\n    Hee\u2019s haunted with a Spirit feminine.\n    In plaine termes thus, the Spirit that I meane,\n    His martiall wife that notable curst queane,\n    No other weapons but her nailes or fist,\n    Poore patient Idiot he dares not resist,\n    His neighbor once would borrow but his knife,\n    Good neighbor stay (quoth he) ile aske my wife:\n    Once came he home inspired in the head,\n    He found his neighbor and his wife a bed,\n    Yet durst not sturre, but hide him in a hole,\n    He feared to displease his wife poore soule.\n    But why should he so dreade and feare her hate,\n    Since she had given him armor for his pate?\n    Next day forsooth he doth his neighbor meete,\n    Whome with sterne rage thus furiously doth greete,\n    Villaine ile slit thy nose, out comes his knife,\n    Sirra (quoth he) goe to Ile tell your wife.\n    Apaled at which terror, meekely faide\n    Retire good knife my furie is allaide.\n\n\n\n\n_Proteus._\n\n\n    Time serving humour thou wrie-faced Ape,\n    That canst transforme thy selfe to any shape:\n    Come good _Proteus_ come away a pace,\n    We long to see thy mumping Antique face.\n    This is the fellow that lives by his wit,\n    A cogging knave and fawning Parrasit,\n    He has behaviour for the greatest porte,\n    And hee has humors for the rascall sorte,\n    He has beene great with Lordes and high estates,\n    They could not live without his rare conceites,\n    He was associat for the bravest spirits,\n    His galland carriage such favour merrits.\n    Yet to a Ruffiin humor for the stewes,\n    A right graund Captaine of the damned crewes,\n    With whome his humor alwayes is unstable\n    Mad, melancholly, drunke and variable.\n    Hat without band like cutting Dicke he goe\u2019s,\n    Renowned for his new invented oathes.\n    Sometimes like a Civilian, tis strange\n    At twelve a clocke he must unto the Change,\n    Where being thought a Marchant to the eye,\n    He tels strange newes his humor is to lie.\n    Some Damaske coate the effect thereof must heare,\n    Invites him home and there he gets good cheare.\n    But how is\u2019t now such brave renowned wits,\n    Weare ragged robes with such huge gastly slits,\n    Faith thus a ragged humour he hath got\n    Whole garments for the Summer are too hot.\n    Thus you may censure gently if you please,\n    He weares such garments onely for his ease.\n    Or thus his credit will no longer wave.\n    For all men know him for a prating knave.\n\n\n\n\n_Epigram._\n\n\n    A Scholer newly entred marriage life\n    Following his studdie did offend his wife,\n    Because when she his company expected,\n    By

(I would I had my sute in houns-ditch heere)\n    Do not my spurs pronounce a silver sounde?\n    Do\u2019s not my hose circumference profounde?\n    Sir these are well, but there is one thing ill,\n    Your Tailour with a sheete of paper bill,\n    Vowes heel\u2019e be paid, and Serjeants he had feed,\n    Which wayte your comming forth to do thy deede:\n    Boy god-amercy let my Lady stay,\n    Ile see no counter for her sake to day.\n\n\n\n\n_Much a doe about chusing a wife._\n\n\n    A Widdower would have a wife were old,\n    Past charge of children to prevent expence\n    Her chests and bagges cram\u2019d till they crake with gold,\n    And she unto her grave post quickly hence,\n    But if all this were fitting to his minde,\n    Where is his lease of life to stay behinde?\n\n    A Batcheler would have wife were wise,\n    Faire, Rich and Younge, a maiden for his bed,\n    Not proude, nor churlish but of fautles size,\n    A country housewife, in the Citty bred.\n    But hees a foole and longe in vaine hath staide,\n    He shoulde bespeake her, there\u2019s none ready made.\n\n\n\n\n_The taming of a wilde Youth._\n\n\n    Of late a deare and loving friend of mine,\n    That all his time a Gallant youth had bene,\n    From mirth to melancholy did decline,\n    Looking exeeding pale, leane, poore, and thin,\n    I ask\u2019d the cause he brought me through the streete,\n    Unto his house, and there hee let me see,\n    A woman proper, faire, wise and discreete\n    And said behould, heer\u2019s that hath tamed mee,\n    Hath this (quoth I,) can such a wife do so?\n    Lord how is he tam\u2019d then, that hath a shrow.\n\n\n\n\n_A straunge sighted Traveller._\n\n\n    An honest Country foole being gentle bred,\n    Was by an odde conceited humor led,\n    To travell and some English fashions see,\n    With such strange sights as heere at London be.\n    Stuffing his purse with a good golden some,\n    This wandring knight did to the Cittie come,\n    And there a servingman he entertaines,\n    An honester in Newgate not remaines.\n    He shew\u2019d his Maister sights to him most strange,\n    Great tall Pauls Steeple and the royall-Exchange:\n    The Bosse at _Billings-gate_ and _London-stone_\n    And at _White-Hall_ the monstrous great Whales bone,\n    Brought him to the banck-side where Beares do dwell\n    And unto _Shor-ditch_ where the whores keepe hell,\n    Shew\u2019d him the Lyons, Gyants in Guild-Hall,\n    King _Lud_ at _Lud-gate_, the _Babounes_ and all,\n    At length his man, on all he had did pray,\n    Shew\u2019d him a theevish trick and ran away,\n    The Traveller turnd home exceeding civill,\n    And swore in London he had seene the Devill.\n\n\n\n\n_Three kinde of Couckoldes_,\n\nOne, And None.\n\n\n    First there\u2019s a Cuckolde called One and None,\n    Which foole, from fortune hath receiv\u2019d such favour\n    He hath a wife for beutie stands alone,\n    Grac\u2019d with good carriage, and most sweete behaviour\n    Nature so bounteous hath her gifts extended.\n    From head to foote ther\u2019s nothing to be mended.\n\n    Besides, she is as perfect chast, as faire,\n    But being married to a jealous asse,\n    He vowes she hornes him, for he feeles a paire\n    Have bin a growing ever since last grasse,\n    No contrary perswasions hee\u2019l indure,\n    But\u2019s wife is faire and hee\u2019s a Cuckolde sure.\n\n\n\n\n_The second._\n\nNone, and One.\n\n\n    The second hath a wife that loves the game,\n    And playes the secret cunnig whore at plaisure.\n    But in her husbands sight shees wondrous tame,\n    Which makes him vow, he hath _Ulisses_ treasure.\n    Sheele wish al whores were hang\u2019d, with weeping teares\n    Yet she her selfe a whores cloathes dayly weares.\n\n    Her husb\u0101ds friends report how\u2019s wife doth gull him\n    With false deceitfull and dissembling showe\n    And that by both his hornes a man may pull him,\n    To such a goodly length they daylie growe,\n    He sayes they wrong her, and he sweares they lye,\n    His wife is chaste, and in that minde hee\u2019le dye.\n\n\n\n\n_The Third_,\n\nOne, and One.\n\n\n    The third is he that knowes women are weake,\n    And therefore they are dayly apt to fall,\n    Words of unkindnesse their kind hearts may breake,\n    They are but flesh and therefore sinners all,\n    His wife is not the first hath trod a wry,\n    Amongst his neighbours he as bad can spye.\n\n    What can he helpe it if his wife do ill,\n    But take it as his crosse and be content,\n    For quietnesse he lets her have her will,\n    When shee is old perhaps she will repent,\n    Let every one amend their one bad life,\n    Th\u2019are knaves and queans that medle with his wife.\n\n\nFINIS.",
