    "body": "\n\nKEEPING WATCH\n\n\"Human natur'!\"  said the night-watchman, gazing fixedly at a pretty\ngirl in a passing waterman's skiff.  \"Human natur'!\"\n\nHe sighed, and, striking a match, applied it to his pipe and sat smoking\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"The young fellow is pretending that his arm is at the back of her by\naccident,\" he continued; \"and she's pretending not to know that it's\nthere.  When he's allowed to put it round 'er waist whenever he wishes,\nhe won't want to do it.  She's artful enough to know that, and that's\nwhy they are all so stand-offish until the thing is settled.  She'll\nmove forward 'arf an inch presently, and 'arf a minute arterwards she'll\nlean back agin without thinking.  She's a nice-looking gal, and what she\ncan see in a tailor's dummy like that, I can't think.\"\n\nHe leaned back on his box and, folding his arms, emitted a cloud of\nsmoke.\n\n\"Human natur's a funny thing.  I've seen a lot of it in my time, and if\nI was to 'ave my life all over agin I expect I should be just as silly\nas them two in the skiff.  I've known the time when I would spend money\nas free over a gal as I would over myself.  I on'y wish I'd got all the\nmoney now that I've spent on peppermint lozenges.\n\n\"That gal in the boat reminds me o' one I used to know a few years ago.\nJust the same innercent baby look--a look as if butter wouldn't melt in\n'er mouth--and a artful disposition that made me sorry for 'er sects.\n\n\"She used to come up to this wharf once a week in a schooner called the\nBelle.  Her father, Cap'n Butt, was a widow-man, and 'e used to bring\nher with 'im, partly for company and partly because 'e could keep 'is\neye on her.  Nasty eye it, was, too, when he 'appened to be out o'\ntemper.\n\n\"I'd often took a bit o' notice o' the gal; just giving 'er a kind smile\nnow and then as she sat on deck, and sometimes--when 'er father wasn't\nlooking--she'd smile back.  Once, when 'e was down below, she laughed\nright out.  She was afraid of 'im, and by and by I noticed that she\ndaren't even get off the ship and walk up and down the wharf without\nasking 'im.  When she went out 'e was with 'er, and, from one or two\nnasty little snacks I 'appened to overhear when the skipper thought I\nwas too far away, I began to see that something was up.\n\n\"It all came out one evening, and it only came out because the skipper\nwanted my help.  I was standing leaning on my broom to get my breath\nback arter a bit o' sweeping, when he came up to me, and I knew at once,\nby the nice way 'e spoke, that he wanted me to do something for 'im.\n\n\"'Come and 'ave a pint, Bill,' he ses.\n\n\"I put my broom agin the wall, and we walked round to the Bull's Head\nlike a couple o' brothers.  We 'ad two pints apiece, and then he put his\n'and on my shoulder and talked as man to man.\n\n\"'I'm in a little bit o' difficulty about that gal o' mine,' he ses,\npassing me his baccy-box.  'Six months ago she dropped a letter out of\n'er pocket, and I'm blest if it wasn't from a young man.  A young man!'\n\n\"'You sur-prise me,' I ses, meaning to be sarcastic.\n\n\"'I surprised her,' he ses, looking very fierce.  'I went to 'er box and\nI found a pile of 'em-a pile of 'em-tied up with a piece o' pink ribbon.\nAnd a photygraph of my lord.  And of all the narrer-chested, weak-eyed,\nslack-baked, spindly-legged sons of a gun you ever saw in your life, he\nis the worst.  If I on'y get my 'ands on him I'll choke 'im with his own\nfeet.'\n\n\"He washed 'is mouth out with a drop o' beer and stood scowling at the\nfloor.\n\n\"'Arter I've choked 'im I'll twist his neck,' he ses.  'If he 'ad on'y\nput his address on 'is letters, I'd go round and do it now.  And my\ndaughter, my only daughter, won't tell me where he lives.'\n\n\"'She ought to know better,' I ses.\n\n\"He took hold o' my 'and and shook it.  'You've got more sense than one\n'ud think to look at you, Bill,' he ses, not thinking wot he was saying.\n'You see wot a mess I'm in.'\n\n\"'Yes,' I ses.\n\n\"'I'm a nurse, that's wot I am,' he ses, very savage.  'Just a\nnursemaid. I can't move 'and or foot without that gal.  'Ow'd you like\nit, yourself, Bill?'\n\n\"'It must be very orkard for you,' I ses.  'Very orkard indeed.'\n\n\"'Orkard !' he ses; 'it's no name for it, Bill.  I might as well be a\nSunday-school teacher, and ha' done with it.  I never 'ad such a dull\ntime in all my life.  Never.  And the worst of it is, it's spiling my\ntemper.  And all because o' that narrer-eyed, red-chested--you know wot\nI mean!'\n\n\"He took another mouthful o' beer, and then he took 'old of my arm.\n'Bill,' he ses, very earnest, 'I want you to do me a favour.'\n\n\"'Go ahead,' I ses.\n\n\"'I've got to meet a pal at Charing Cross at ha'-past seven,' he ses;\n'and we're going to make a night of it.  I've left Winnie in charge o'\nthe cook, and I've told 'im plain that, if she ain't there when I come\nback, I'll skin 'im alive.  Now, I want you to watch 'er, too.  Keep the\ngate locked, and don't let anybody in you don't know.  Especially that\nmonkey-faced imitation of a man.  Here 'e is.  That's his likeness.'\n\n\"He pulled a photygraph out of 'is coatpocket and 'anded it to me.\n\n\"'That's 'im,' he ses.  'Fancy a gal getting love-letters from a thing\nlike that!  And she was on'y twenty last birthday.  Keep your eye on\n'er, Bill, and don't let 'er out of your sight.  You're worth two o' the\ncook.'\n\n\"He finished 'is beer, and, cuddling my arm, stepped back to the wharf.\nMiss Butt was sitting on the cabin skylight reading a book, and old Joe,\nthe cook, was standing near 'er pretending to swab the decks with a mop.\n\n\"'I've got to go out for a little while--on business,' ses the skipper.\n'I don't s'pose I shall be long, and, while I'm away, Bill and the cook\nwill look arter you.'\n\n\"Miss Butt wrinkled up 'er shoulders.\n\n\"'The gate'll be locked, and you're not to leave the wharf.  D'ye 'ear?'\n\n\"The gal wriggled 'er shoulders agin and went on reading, but she gave\nthe cook a look out of 'er innercent baby eyes that nearly made 'im drop\nthe mop.\n\n\"'Them's my orders,' ses the skipper, swelling his chest and looking\nround, 'to everybody.  You know wot'll 'appen to you, Joe, if things\nain't right when I come back.  Come along, Bill, and lock the gate arter\nme.  An' mind, for your own sake, don't let anything 'appen to that gal\nwhile I'm away.'\n\n\"'Wot time'll you be back?' I ses, as 'e stepped through the wicket.\n\n\"'Not afore twelve, and p'r'aps a good bit later,' he ses, smiling all\nover with 'appiness.  'But young slab-chest don't know I'm out, and\nWinnie thinks I'm just going out for 'arf an hour, so it'll be all\nright. So long.'\n\n\"I watched 'im up the road, and I must say I began to wish I 'adn't\ntaken the job on.  Arter all, I 'ad on'y had two pints and a bit o'\nflattery, and I knew wot 'ud 'appen if anything went wrong.  Built like\na bull he was, and fond o' using his strength.  I locked the wicket\ncareful, and, putting the key in my pocket, began to walk up and down\nthe wharf.\n\n\"For about ten minutes the gal went on reading and didn't look up once.\nThen, as I passed, she gave me a nice smile and shook 'er little fist at\nthe cook, wot 'ad got 'is back towards 'er.  I smiled back, o' course,\nand by and by she put her book down and climbed on to the side o' the\nship and held out her 'and for me to 'elp her ashore.\n\n\"'I'm so tired of the ship,' she ses, in a soft voice; 'it's like a\nprison.  Don't you get, tired of the wharf?'\n\n\"'Sometimes,' I ses; 'but it's my dooty.'\n\n\"'Yes,' she ses.  'Yes, of course.  But you're a big, strong man, and\nyou can put up with things better.'\n\n\"She gave a little sigh, and we walked up and down for a time without\nsaying anything.\n\n\"'And it's all father's foolishness,' she ses, at last; 'that's wot\nmakes it so tiresome.  I can't help a pack of silly young men writing to\nme, can I?'\n\n\"'No, I s'pose not,' I ses.\n\n\"'Thank you,' she ses, putting 'er little 'and on my arm.  'I knew that\nyou were sensible.  I've often watched you when I've been sitting alone\non the schooner, longing for somebody to speak to.  And I'm a good judge\nof character.  I can read you like a book.'\n\n\"She turned and looked up at me.  Beautiful blue eyes she'd got, with\nlong, curling lashes, and teeth like pearls.\n\n\"'Father is so silly,' she ses, shaking her 'ead and looking down; 'and\nit's so unreasonable, because, as a matter of fact, I don't like young\nmen.  Oh, I beg your pardon, I didn't mean that.  I didn't mean to be\nrude.'\n\n\"'Rude?' I ses, staring at her.\n\n\"'Of course it was a rude thing for me to say,' she ses, smiling;\n'because you are still a young man yourself.'\n\n\"I shook my 'ead.  'Youngish,' I ses.\n\n\"'Young!' she ses, stamping 'er little foot.\n\n\"She gave me another look, and this time 'er blue eyes seemed large and\nsolemn.  She walked along like one in a dream, and twice she tripped\nover the planks and would 'ave fallen if I hadn't caught 'er round the\nwaist.\n\n\"'Thank you,' she ses.  'I'm very clumsy.  How strong your arm is!'\n\n\"We walked up and down agin, and every time we went near the edge of the\njetty she 'eld on to my arm for fear of stumbling agin.  And there was\nthat silly cook standing about on the schooner on tip-toe and twisting\nhis silly old neck till I wonder it didn't twist off.\n\n\"'Wot a beautiful evening it is!' she ses, at last, in a low voice.  'I\n'ope father isn't coming back early.  Do you know wot time he is coming\nhome?'\n\n\"'About twelve,' I ses; 'but don't tell 'im I told you so.'\n\n\"'O' course not,' she ses, squeezing my arm.  'Poor father! I hope he is\nenjoying himself as much as I am.'\n\n\"We walked down to the jetty agin arter that, and sat side by side\nlooking acrost the river.  And she began to talk about Life, and wot a\nstrange thing it was; and 'ow the river would go on flowing down to the\nsea thousands and thousands o' years arter we was both dead and\nforgotten.  If it hadn't ha' been for her little 'ead leaning agin my\nshoulder I should have 'ad the creeps.\n\n\"'Let's go down into the cabin,' she ses, at last, with a little shiver;\n'it makes me melancholy sitting here and thinking of the \"might-have-\nbeens.\"'\n\n\"I got up first and 'elped her up, and, arter both staring hard at the\ncook, wot didn't seem to know 'is place, we went down into the cabin.\nIt was a comfortable little place, and arter she 'ad poured me out a\nglass of 'er father's whisky, and filled my pipe for me, I wouldn't ha'\nchanged places with a king.  Even when the pipe wouldn't draw I didn't\nmind.\n\n\"'May I write a letter?' she ses, at last.\n\n\"'Sartainly,' I ses.\n\n\"She got out her pen and ink and paper, and wrote.  'I sha'n't be long,'\nshe ses, looking up and nibbling 'er pen.  'It's a letter to my\ndressmaker; she promised my dress by six o'clock this afternoon, and I\nam just writing to tell her that if I don't have it by ten in the\nmorning she can keep it.'\n\n\"'Quite right,' I ses; 'it's the on'y way to get things done.'\n\n\"'It's my way,' she ses, sticking the letter in an envelope and licking\nit down.  'Nice name, isn't it?'\n\n\"She passed it over to me, and I read the name and address: 'Miss Minnie\nMiller, 17, John Street, Mile End Road.'\n\n\"'That'll wake her up,' She ses, smiling.  'Will you ask Joe to take it\nfor me?'\n\n\"'He--he's on guard,' I ses, smiling back at 'er and shaking my 'ead.\n\n\"'I know,' she ses, in a low voice.  'But I don't want any guard--only\nyou.  I don't like guards that peep down skylights.'\n\n\"I looked up just in time to see Joe's 'ead disappear.  Then I nipped\nup, and arter I 'ad told 'im part of wot I thought about 'im I gave 'im\nthe letter and told 'im to sheer off.\n\n\"'The skipper told me to stay 'ere,' he ses, looking obstinate.\n\n\"'You do as you're told,' I ses.  'I'm in charge, and I take full\nresponsibility.  I shall lock the gate arter you.  Wot are you worrying\nabout?'\n\n\"'And here's a shilling, Joe, for a bus fare,' ses the gal, smiling.\n'You can keep the change.'\n\n\"Joe took off 'is cap and scratched 'is silly bald 'ead.\n\n\"'Come on,' I ses; 'it's a letter to a dressmaker.  A letter that must\ngo to-night.'\n\n\"'Else it's no use,' ses the gal.  'You don't know 'ow important it is.'\n\n\"'All right,' ses Joe.  ''Ave it your own way.  So long as you don't\ntell the skipper I don't mind.  If anything 'appens you'll catch it too,\nBill.'\n\n\"He climbed ashore, and I follered 'im to the gate and unlocked it.  He\nwas screwing up 'is eye ready for a wink, but I give 'im such a look\nthat he thought better of it, and, arter rubbing his eye with 'is finger\nas though he 'ad got a bit o' dust in it, he went off.\n\n\"I locked the gate and went back to the cabin, and for some time we sat\ntalking about fathers and the foolish ideas they got into their 'eads,\nand things o' that sort.  So far as I remember, I 'ad two more goes o'\nwhisky and one o' the skipper's cigars, and I was just thinking wot a\nbeautiful thing it was to be alive and 'ealthy and in good spirits,\ntalking to a nice gal that understood wot you said a'most afore you said\nit, when I 'eard three blows on a whistle.\n\n\"'Wot's that?' I ses, starting up.  'Police whistle?'\n\n\"'I don't think so,' ses Miss Butt, putting her 'and on my shoulder.\n'Sit down and stay where you are.  I don't want you to get hurt, if it\nis.  Let somebody I don't like go.'\n\n\"I sat down agin and listened, but there was no more whistling.\n\n\"'Boy in the street, I expect,' ses the gal, going into the state-room.\n'Oh, I've got something to show you.  Wait a minute.'\n\n\"I 'eard her moving about, and then she comes back into the cabin.\n\n\"'I can't find the key of my box,' she ses, 'and it's in there.  I\nwonder whether you've got a key that would open it.  It's a padlock.'\n\n\"I put my 'and in my pocket and pulled out my keys.  'Shall I come and\ntry?' I ses.\n\n\"'No, thank you,' she ses, taking the keys.  'This looks about the size.\nWhat key is it?'\n\n\"'It's the key of the gate,' I ses, 'but I don't suppose it'll fit.'\n\n\"She went back into the state-room agin, and I 'eard her fumbling at a\nlock.  Then she came back into the cabin, breathing rather hard, and\nstood thinking.\n\n\"'I've just remembered,' she ses, pinching her chin.  'Yes!'\n\n\"She stepped to the door and went up the companion-ladder, and the next\nmoment I 'eard a sliding noise and a key turn in a lock.  I jumped to\nthe foot of the ladder and, 'ardly able to believe my senses, saw that\nthe hatch was closed.  When I found that it was locked too, you might\nha' knocked me down with a feather.\n\n\"I went down to the cabin agin, and, standing on the locker, pushed the\nskylight up with my 'ead and tried to lookout.  I couldn't see the gate,\nbut I 'eard voices and footsteps, and a little while arterwards I see\nthat gal coming along the wharf arm in arm with the young man she 'ad\ntold me she didn't like, and dancing for joy.  They climbed on to the\nschooner, and then they both stooped down with their hands on their\nknees and looked at me.\n\n\"'Wot is it?' ses the young man, grinning.\n\n\"'It's a watchman,' ses the gal.  'It's here to take charge of the\nwharf, you know, and see that nobody comes on.'\n\n\"'We ought to ha' brought some buns for it,' ses the young man; 'look at\nit opening its mouth.'\n\n\"They both laughed fit to kill themselves, but I didn't move a muscle.\n\n\"'You open the companion,' I ses, 'or it'll be the worse for you.  D'ye\nhear?  Open it !'\n\n\"'Oh, Alfred,' ses the gal, 'he's losing 'is temper.  Wotever shall we\ndo?'\n\n\"'I don't want no more nonsense,' I ses, trying to fix 'er with my eye.\n'If you don't let me out it'll be the worse for you.'\n\n\"'Don't you talk to my young lady like that,' ses the young man.\n\n\"'Your young lady?' I ses.  'H'mm!  You should ha' seen 'er 'arf an hour\nago.'\n\n\"The gal looked at me steady for a moment.\n\n\"'He put 'is nasty fat arm round my waist, Alfred,' she ses.\n\n\"'Wot!' ses the young man, squeaking.  'WOT!'\n\n\"He snatched up the mop wot that nasty, untidy cook 'ad left leaning\nagin the side, and afore I 'ad any idea of wot 'e was up to he shoved\nthe beastly thing straight in my face.\n\n\"'Next time,' he ses, 'I'll tear you limb from limb!'\n\n\"I couldn't speak for a time, and when I could 'e stopped me with the\nmop agin.  It was like a chained lion being tormented by a monkey.  I\nstepped down on to the cabin floor, and then I told 'em both wot I\nthought of 'em.\n\n\"'Come along, Alfred,' ses the gal, 'else the cook'll be back before we\nstart.'\n\n\"'He's all right,' ses the young man.  'Minnie's looking arter him.\nWhen I left he'd got 'arf a bottle of whisky in front of 'im.'\n\n\"'Still, we may as well go,' ses Miss Butt.  'It seems a shame to keep\nthe cab waiting.'\n\n\"'All right,' he ses.  'I just want to give this old chump one more lick\nwith the mop and then we'll go.'\n\n\"He peeped down the skylight and waited, but I kept quite quiet, with my\nback towards 'im.\n\n\"'Come along,' ses Miss Butt.\n\n\"'I'm coming,' he ses.  'Hi!  You down there!  When the cap'n comes back\ntell 'im that I'm taking Miss Butt to an aunt o' mine in the country.\nAnd tell'im that in a week or two he'll 'ave the largest and nicest\npiece of wedding-cake he 'as ever 'ad in his life.  So long!'\n\n\"'Good-bye, watchman,' ses the gal.\n\n\"They moved off without another word--from them, I mean.  I heard the\nwicket slam and then I 'eard a cab drive off over the stones.  I\ncouldn't believe it at first.  I couldn't believe a gal with such\nbeautiful blue eyes could be so hard-'earted, and for a long time I\nstood listening and hoping to 'ear the cab come back.  Then I stepped up\nto the companion and tried to shift it with my shoulders.\n\n\"I went back to the cabin at last, and arter lighting the lamp I 'ad\nanother sup o' the skipper's whisky to clear my 'ead, and sat down to\ntry and think wot tale I was to tell 'im.  I sat for pretty near three\nhours without thinking of one, and then I 'eard the crew come on to the\nwharf.\n\n\"They was a bit startled when they saw my 'ead at the skylight, and then\nthey all started at the same time asking me wot I was doing.  I told 'em\nto let me out fust and then I'd tell 'em, and one of 'em 'ad just\nstepped round to the companion when the skipper come on to the wharf and\nstepped aboard.  He stooped down and peeped at me through the skylight\nas though he couldn't believe 'is eyesight, and then, arter sending the\nhands for'ard and telling 'em to stay there, wotever 'appened, he\nunlocked the companion and came down.\"",
