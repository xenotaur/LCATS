    "body": "Some men and some scenes so fasten themselves into one's memory that the\nyears, with their crowding scenes and men, have no power to displace\nthem. I can never forget \"Ould Michael\" and the scene of my first\nknowing him. All day long I rode, driving in front my pack-pony laden\nwith my photograph kit, tent and outfit, following the trail that would\nend somewhere on the Pacific Coast, some hundreds of miles away. I was\nweary enough of dodging round the big trees, pushing through underbrush,\nscrambling up and down mountain-sides, hugging cliffs where the trail\ncut in and wading warily through the roaring torrent of \"Sixty-mile\nCreek.\" As the afternoon wore on, the trail left the creek and wound\naway over a long slope up the mountain-side.\n\n\"Ginger,\" said I to my riding pony, \"we are getting somewhere\"--for our\ntrail began to receive other trails from the side valleys and the going\nwas better. At last it pushed up into the open, circled round a shoulder\nof the mountain, clinging tight, for the drop was sheer two hundred\nfeet, and--there before us stretched the great Fraser Valley! From my\nfeet the forest rolled its carpet of fir-tops--dark-green, soft,\nluxurious. Far down to the bottom and up again, in waving curves it\nswept, to the summit of the distant mountains opposite, and through this\ndark-green mass the broad river ran like a silver ribbon gleaming in the\nsunlight.\n\nFollowing the line of the trail, my eye fell upon that which has often\nmade men's hearts hard and lured them on to joyous death. There, above\nthe green tree-tops, in a clearing, stood a tall white mast and from the\npeak, flaunting its lazy, proud defiance, flew a Union Jack.\n\n\"Now, Ginger, how in the name of the Empire comes that brave rag to be\nshaking itself out over these valleys!\"\n\nGinger knew not, but, in answer to my heels, set off at a canter down\nthe slope and, in a few minutes, we reached a grassy bench that\nstretched down to the river-bank. On the bench was huddled an irregular\ngroup of shacks and cabins and, in front of the first and most imposing\nof them, stood the tall mast with its floating flag. On the wide\nplatform that ran in front of this log cabin a man was sitting, smoking\na short bull-dog pipe. By his dress and style I saw at once that he had\nserved in Her Majesty's army. As I rode up under the flag I lifted my\ncap, held it high and called out: \"God save the Queen!\" Instantly he was\non his feet and, coming to attention with a military salute, replied\nwith great fervor: \"God bless her!\" From that moment he took me to his\nheart.\n\nThat was my introduction to \"Ould Michael,\" as everyone in the Valley\ncalled him, and as he called himself.\n\nAfter his fifth glass, when he would become dignified, \"Ould Michael\"\nwould drop his brogue and speak of himself as \"Sergeant McGrath, late of\nHer Majesty's Ninety-third Highlanders,\" Irishman though he was.\n\nThough he had passed his sixtieth year, he was still erect and brisk\nenough in his movement, save for a slight hitch in his left leg. \"A\ntouch of a knife,\" he explained, \"in the Skoonder Bag.\"\n\n\"The where?\"\n\n\"Skoonder Bag, forninst the walls the Lucknow--to the left over, ye\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"I'm ashamed to say I don't,\" I answered, feeling that I was on the\ntrack of a yarn.\n\nHe looked at me pityingly.\n\n\"Ye've heard av Sir Colin?\" He was not going to take anything for\ngranted.\n\nI replied hastily: \"Sir Colin Campbell, of course.\"\n\n\"Well, we was followin' Sir Colin up to the belagured city when we run\ninto the Skoonder Bag--big stone walls and windys high up, and full av\nmin, like a jail, or a big disthillery.\"\n\nThen, like a dream from the past, it came to me that he was talking of\nthat bloody fight about and in the \"Secunderabogh,\" where, through a\nbreach two feet square, the men of the Ninety-third, man by man, forced\ntheir way in the face of a thousand Sepoys, mad for blood and, with\ntheir bayonets, piled high in gory heaps the bodies of their black foes,\ncrying with every thrust, in voices hoarse with rage and dust,\n\"Cawnpore! Cawnpore!\" That tale Ould Michael would never tell till his\ncups had carried him far beyond the stage of dignity and reserve.\n\nAfter he had helped me to picket my ponies and pitch my tent, he led me\nby a little gate through his garden to the side door of the cabin.\n\nThe garden was trim, like Ould Michael himself, set out in rectangular\nbeds, by gravel-walks and low-cut hedges of \"old man.\" It was filled\nwith all the dear old-fashioned flowers--Sweet William and Sweet Mary,\nbachelor's buttons, pansies and mignonette, old country daisies and\nsnapdragons and lilies of the valley and, in the centre of the beds,\ngreat masses of peonies, while all around, peeping from under the\nhedges of old man, were poppies of every hue. Beyond the garden there\nwas a plot of potatoes, cabbage and other vegetables and, best of all\nand more beautiful than all, over the whole front of the cabin,\ncompletely hiding the rough logs, ran a climbing rose, a mass of\nfragrant bloom. Ould Michael lingered lovingly for a moment among his\nflowers, and then led me into the house.\n\nThe room into which we entered was a wonder for preciseness and order.\nThe walls were decorated with prints, much-faded photographs, stuffed\nbirds, heads of deer and a quaint collection of old-fashioned guns,\npistols and bayonets, but all arranged with an exactness and taste that\nwould drive mad the modern artistic decorator. On one side of the window\nhung a picture of Wellington: on the other, that of Sir Colin. To the\nright of the clock, on a shelf, stood a stuffed mallard; to the left on\na similar shelf, stood a stuffed owl. The same balance was diligently\npreserved in the arrangement of his weapons of war. A pine table stood\nagainst one wall, flanked by a home-made chair on either side. A door\nopened to the left into a bedroom, as I supposed; another, to the right,\ninto what Ould Michael designated \"My office, sir.\"\n\n\"Office?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" still preserving his manual of ceremony, \"Her Majesty's mail\nfor Grand Bend.\"\n\n\"And you are the Postmaster?\" I said, throwing into my voice the respect\nand awe that I felt were expected.\n\n\"That same,\" with a salute.\n\n\"That explains the flag, then; you are bound to keep that flying, I\nsuppose.\"\n\n\"Bound, sir? Yes, but by no law is it.\"\n\n\"How, then?\"\n\n\"For twenty-five years I marched and fought under that same flag,\" said\nthe old soldier, dropping into his brogue, \"and under it, plaze God,\nI'll die.\"\n\nI looked at the old man. In his large dark-blue eyes shone that \"fire\nthat never slumbers\"--the fire of loyal valor, with its strange power to\ntransform common clay into men of heroic mould. The flag, the garden,\nthe postoffice--these were Ould Michael's household gods. The equipment\nof the postoffice was primitive enough.\n\n\"Where are the boxes?\" I inquired; \"the letter-boxes, you know; to put\nthe letters into.\"\n\n\"An' what wud I do puttin' them into boxes, at all?\"\n\n\"Why, to distribute the mail so that you could find every man's letter\nwhen he calls for it.\"\n\n\"An' what would I be doin' findin' a man's letter for him? Shure an'\ncan't he find it himself on the counter there?\" pointing to a wide plank\nthat ran along the wall.\n\nI explained fully the ordinary system of distributing mail to him.\n\n\"Indade, 'tis a complicated system intoirely,\" and then he proceeded to\nexplain his own, which he described as \"simple and unpretenshus\" and,\nsure enough, it was; for the letters were strewn upon the top of the\ncounter, the papers and other mail-matter thrown underneath, and every\nman helped himself to his own.\n\n\"But might there not be mistakes?\" I suggested. \"A man might take his\nneighbor's letter.\"\n\n\"An' what would he do wid another man's letter forby the discooshun that\nmight enshoo?\"\n\nI was very soon to have an opportunity of observing the working of Ould\nMichael's system, for next day was mailday and, in the early afternoon,\nmen began to arrive from the neighboring valleys for their monthly mail.\nOuld Michael introduced me to them all with much ceremony and I could\neasily see that he was a personage of importance among them. Not only\nwas he, as postmaster, the representative among them of Her Majesty's\nGovernment, but they were proud of him as standing for all that was\nheroic in the Empire's history; for a man who had touched shoulders with\nthose who had fought their way under India's fierce suns and through\nIndia's swamps and jungles, from Calcutta to Lucknow and back, was no\ncommon citizen, but a man who trailed glory in his wake. More than this,\nOuld Michael was a friend to all, and they loved him for his simple,\ngenerous heart. Too generous, as it turned out, for every month it was\nhis custom to summon his friends to Paddy Dougan's bar and spend the\ngreater part of the monthly remittance that came in his letter from\nhome. That monthly letter should be placed in the category of household\ngods with the flag, the garden and the postoffice. Its arrival was\nalways an occasion for celebration--not for the remittance it contained,\nbut for the wealth of love and tender memory it brought to Ould Michael\nin this far-off land.\n\nLate in the afternoon, just before the arrival of the mail-stage, there\nrode up the bench towards the postoffice a man remarkable even in that\ncompany of remarkable men. He was tall--a good deal over six\nfeet--spare, bony, with huge hands and feet and evidently possessed of\nimmense strength. His face and head were covered with a mass of shaggy\nhair--brick-red mixed with grey--and out of this mass of grizzled hair\ngleamed two small grey eyes, very bright and very keen.\n\n\"Howly mither av Moses!\" shouted Ould Michael rushing towards him; \"'tis\nMcFarquhar. My friend, Mr. McFarquhar,\" said Ould Michael, presenting me\nin his most ceremonious style and standing at attention.\n\nMcFarquhar took my hand in his paw and gave me a grasp so cordial that,\nwere it not for the shame of it, I would have roared out in agony.\n\n\"I am proud to make the acquaintance of you,\" he said, with a strong\nhighland accent. \"You will be a stranger in these parts?\"\n\nI told him as much of my history and affairs as I thought necessary and\ndrew from him as much information about himself and his life as I could,\nwhich was not much. He had come to the country a lad of twenty to take\nservice under the Hudson Bay Company. Fifteen years ago had left the\nCompany and had settled in the valley of Grizzly Creek, which empties\ninto the Fraser a little below the Grand Bend. I found out too, but not\nfrom himself, that he had married an Indian woman and that, with her and\nhis two boys, he lived the half-savage life of a hunter and rancher. He\nwas famous as a hunter of the grizzly bears that once frequented his\nvalley and, indeed, he bore the name of \"Grizzly McFarquhar\" among the\nold-timers.\n\nHe was Ould Michael's dearest friend. Many a long hunt had they taken\ntogether, and over and over again did they owe their lives to each\nother. But the hour had now come for the performance of Ould Michael's\nmonthly duty. The opening of the mail was a solemn proceeding. The bag\nwas carried in from the stage by Ould Michael, followed by the entire\ncrowd in a kind of triumphal procession, and reverently deposited upon\nthe counter. The key was taken down from its hook above the window,\ninserted into the lock, turned with a flourish and then hung up in its\nplace. From his pocket Ould Michael then took a clasp-knife with a\nwicked-looking, curved blade, which he laid beside the bag. He then\nplaced a pair of spectacles on his nose and, in an impressive manner and\namidst dead silence, opened the bag, poured out its contents upon the\ncounter, turned it inside out and carefully shook it. No one in the\ncrowd moved. With due deliberation Ould Michael, with the wicked-looking\nclasp knife, proceeded to cut the strings binding the various bundles of\nletters and papers. The papers were then deposited beneath the counter\nupon the floor, and the letters spread out upon the counter. The last\nact of the ceremony was the selecting by Ould Michael of his own letter\nfrom the pile, after which, with a waive of the hand, he declared,\n\"Gentlemen, the mail is open,\" when they flung themselves upon it with\nan eagerness that told of the heart-hunger for news from a far-country\nthat is like cool water to the thirsty soul.\n\nThe half-hour that followed the distribution of the mail offered a scene\nstrange and touching. The men who had received letters stood away from\nthe crowd and read them with varying expressions of delight or grief, or\nin silence that spoke more deeply than could any words. For that\nhalf-hour the lonely valleys in these deep forests stood back from them,\nand there opened up a vision of homes far away, filled with faces and\nechoing with voices that some of them knew they would never see nor hear\nagain.\n\nBut no man ever saw Ould Michael read his letter. That half-hour he\nspent in his inner room and, when he came out, there was lingering about\nhis face a glory as of a departing vision. The dark-blue eyes were\ndarker than before and in them that soft, abstracted look that one sees\nin the eye of a child just awakened from sleep. His tongue, so ready at\nother times, would be silent; and he would move softly over to his\nfriend McFarquhar, and stand there as in a dream. As he came toward us\non this occasion, McFarquhar said, in an undertone: \"It is good news\nto-day with Ould Michael,\" adding in answer to my look of inquiry, \"His\nsister has charge of his little girl at home.\"\n\nOuld Michael steed in silence beside his friend for some moments.\n\n\"All well, Michael?\" asked McFarquhar.\n\n\"They are, that,\" answered the old soldier, with a happy sigh. \"Och,\n'tis the lovely land it is, and it's ha-ard to kape away from it.\"\n\n\"I am thinking you are better away from it than in it,\" said McFarquhar,\ndryly.\n\n\"Indade, an' it's thrue for you,\" answered Ould Michael, \"but the longer\ny're from it the more ye love it, an' it's God bless Ould Oireland siz\nI,\" and he bore us off to celebrate.\n\nIt was useless for me to protest. His duty for the month was over; he\nwas a free man. He had had his good news; and why should he not\ncelebrate? Besides, he had money in his pocket, and \"what would the byes\nthink av me if I neglected to set 'em up?\" And set 'em up he did for\n\"the byes\" and for himself, till I heard McFarquhar taking him to his\ncabin to put him to bed long after I had turned in. All through the\nfollowing Sunday Ould Michael continued his celebration, with the\nhearty and uproarious assistance of the rest of the men and most of them\nremained over night for Ould Michael's Sunday spree, which they were\nsure would follow.\n\nHow completely Paddy Dougan's whisky, most of which he made on his back\npremises, changed Ould Michael and the whole company! From being solemn,\nsilent, alert and generally good-natured, they became wildly vociferous,\nreckless, boastful and quarrelsome. That Sunday, as always happens in\nthe Mountains, where there are plenty of whisky and a crowd of men, was\nutterly horrible. The men went wild in all sorts of hideous horseplay,\nbrawls and general debauchery, and among them Ould Michael reigned a\nking.\n\n\"It is bad whisky,\" McFarquhar exclaimed. McFarquhar himself was never\nknown to get drunk, for he knew his limit on good whisky, and he avoided\nbad. Paddy Dougan knew better than to give him any of his own home-made\nbrew, for if, after his fourth, McFarquhar found himself growing\nincapable, knowing that he could enjoy his sixth and even carry with\ncomfort his ninth, then his rage blazed forth, and the only safety for\nPaddy lay in escape to the woods. It was not so much that he despised\nthe weakness of getting drunk, but he resented the fraud that deprived\nhim of the pleasure of leisurely pursuing his way to his proper limit.\n\n\"It is the _bad_ whisky,\" repeated McFarquhar \"and Ould Michael ought to\nknow better than fill himself up with such deplorable stuff.\"\n\n\"Too bad!\" I said.\n\n\"Ay, but I'll jist take him away with me to-morrow and he'll come to in\na few days.\"\n\nI knew enough of the life in these valleys not to be hard with Ould\nMichael and his friends. The slow monotony of the long, lonely weeks\nmade any break welcome, and the only break open to them was that\nafforded by Paddy Dougan's best home-made, a single glass of which would\ndrive a man far on to madness. A new book, a fresh face, a social\ngathering, a Sabbath service--how much one or all of these might do for\nthem!\n\nWith difficulty I escaped from Ould Michael's hospitality and, leaving\nthe scenes of beastly debauchery behind, betook myself to the woods and\nriver. Here, on the lower bench, the woods became an open glade with\nonly the big trees remaining.\n\nI threw myself down on the river-bank and gave myself up to the gracious\ninfluences that stole in upon, me from trees and air and grass and the\nflowing river. The Sabbath feeling began to grow upon me, as the pines\nbehind and the river in front sang to each other soft, crooning songs.\nAs I lay and listened to the solemn music of the great, swaying pines\nand the soft, full melody of the big river, my heart went back to my\nboyhood days when I used to see the people gather in the woods for the\n\"Communion.\" There was the same soothing quiet over all, the same soft,\ncrooning music and, over all, the same sense of a Presence. In my\ndreaming, ever and again there kept coming to me the face of Ould\nMichael, with the look that it bore after reading his home-letter, and I\nthought how different would his Sabbath day have been had his sister and\nhis little one been near to stand between him and the dreariness and\nloneliness of his life.\n\nTrue to his promise, McFarquhar carried off Ould Michael to his ranch up\nGrizzly Creek. Before the sun was high McFarquhar had his own and\nMichael's pony ready at the door and, however unwilling Ould Michael\nmight be, there was nothing for it but march. As they rode off Ould\nMichael took off his hat under the flag and called out:\n\n\"God save Her Majesty!\"\n\n\"God bless her!\" I echoed heartily.\n\nAt once the old soldier clambered down and, tearing open his coat,\npulled out a flask.\n\n\"Mr. McFarquhar,\" he said, solemnly, \"it would be unbecoming in us to\nseparate from our friend without duly honoring Her Gracious Majesty's\nname.\" Then, raising high the flask, he called out with great ceremony,\nand dropping his brogue entirely: \"Gentlemen, I give you the Queen, God\nbless her!\" He raised the flask to his lips and took a long pull and\npassed it to me. After we had duly honored the toast, Ould Michael once\nmore struck an impressive attitude and called out: \"Gentlemen, Her\nMajesty's loyal forces----\" when McFarquhar reached for him and, taking\nthe flask out of his hand, said, gravely:\n\n\"It is a very good toast, but we will postpone the rest till a more\nsuitable occasion.\"\n\nOuld Michael, however, was resolute.\n\n\"It would ill become a British soldier to permit this toast to go\nunhonored.\"\n\n\"Will you come after this one is drunk?\" asked McFarquhar.\n\n\"I will that.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said McFarquhar, \"I drink to the very good health of Her\nMajesty's army,\" and, taking a short pull, he put the flask into his\npocket.\n\nOuld Michael gazed at him in amazed surprise and, after the full meaning\nof the joke had dawned upon him, burst out into laughter.\n\n\"Bedad, McFarquhar, it's the first joke ye iver made, but the less\nfraquent they are the better I loike them.\" So saying, he mounted his\npony and, once more saluting me and then the flag, made off with his\nfriend. Every now and then, however, I could see him sway in his saddle\nunder the gusts of laughter at the excellence of McFarquhar's joke.\n\nThat was the last I saw of Ould Michael for more than six months, but\noften through that winter, as I worked my way to the Coast, I wondered\nwhat the monthly mails were doing for the old man and whether to him and\nto his friends of those secluded valleys any better relief from the\nmonotony of life had come than that offered by Paddy Dougan's back room.\n\nIn early May I found myself once more with my canvas and photographic\napparatus approaching Grand Bend, but this time from the West. As I\nreached the curve in the river where the trail leads to the first view\nof the town I eagerly searched for Ould Michael's flag. There stood the\nmast, sure enough, but there was no flag in sight. What had happened to\nOuld Michael? While he lived his flag would fly. Had he left Grand Bend,\nor had Paddy Dougan's stuff been too much for him? I was rather\nsurprised to find in my heart a keen anxiety for the old soldier. As I\nhurried on I saw that Grand Bend had heard the sound of approaching\ncivilization and was waking up. Two or three saloons, a blacksmith's\nshop, some tents and a new general store proclaimed a boom. As I\napproached the store I saw a sign in big letters across the front,\n\"Jacob Wragge, General Store,\" and immediately over the door, in smaller\nletters, \"Postoffice.\" More puzzled than ever I flung my reins over the\nhitching-post and went in. A number of men stood leaning against the\ncounter and piled-up boxes, none of whom I knew.\n\n\"Is Ould Michael in?\" I asked, forgetting for the moment his proper\nname.\n\n\"In where?\" asked the man behind the counter.\n\n\"The postoffice,\" I replied. \"Doesn't he keep the postoffice?\"\n\n\"Not much,\" he answered, with an insolent laugh; \"it's not much he could\nkeep, unless it's whisky.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you can tell me where he is?\" I asked, keeping my temper down,\nfor I longed to reach for his throat.\n\n\"You'll find him boozing in one of the saloons, like enough, the old\nsot.\"\n\nI walked out without further word, for the longing for his throat grew\nalmost more than I could bear, and went across to Paddy Dougan's. Paddy\nexpressed great delight at seeing me again and, on my asking for Ould\nMichael, became the picture of woe.\n\nFour months ago the postoffice had been taken from Ould Michael and set\nup in Jacob Wragge's store, and with the old soldier things had gone\nbadly ever since.\n\n\"The truth is, an' I'll not desave you,\" said Paddy, adopting a\nconfidential undertone, \"he's drinkin' too much and he is.\"\n\n\"And where is he? And where's his flag?\"\n\n\"His flag is it?\" Paddy shook his head as if to say, \"Now you _have_\ntouched the sore spot. Shure, an' didn't he haul down the flag the day\nthey took the affice frum him.\"\n\n\"And has he never put it up again?\"\n\n\"Niver a bit av it, Man dear,\" and Paddy walked out with me in great\nexcitement.\n\n\"Do you know he niver heard a word till the stage druv be his dure with\nthe mail-bag an' the tap av it an' left the ould man standin' there\nalone. Man, do you know, you wud ha' cried, so you wud, at the look av\nhim; and then he walked over to the flag and hauled it down an' flung it\ninside the affice, an' there it's yit; an' niver a joke out av him\nsince.\"\n\n\"And what is McFarquhar doing all the time?\"\n\n\"Shure he's off on his spring hunt this three months; an' he thried to\nget Ould Michael to go along wid him, but niver a bit wud he; but I\nheard he'll be in to-day and, bedad, there he is!\"\n\nSure enough there was McFarquhar, riding toward us. He gave me a warm\nwelcome back and then fell into talking of Ould Michael. He had only\nseen him once after the loss of his position, but he feared things were\ngoing badly with him. I told him all that Paddy had given me as we\nsearched the saloons. Ould Michael was not to be seen.\n\n\"He will be at home very likely,\" said McFarquhar. \"We will jist put a\nstop to this kind of work.\"\n\nMcFarquhar was torn between grief over his friend's trouble and\nindignation at his weakness and folly. We rode up to Ould Michael's\ncabin. The \"office\" door was locked and the windows boarded up. In the\ngarden all was a wild tangle of flowers and weeds. Nature was bravely\ndoing her best, but she missed the friendly hand that in the past had\ndirected her energies. The climbing rose covered with opening buds was\nhere and there torn from the bare logs.\n\n\"Man, man!\" cried McFarquhar, \"this is a terrible change whatever.\"\n\nWe knocked at the side door and waited, but there was no answer. I\npushed the door open and there, in the midst of disorder and dirt, sat\nOuld Michael. I could hardly believe it possible that in so short a time\nso great a change could come to a man. His hair hung in long grey locks\nabout his ears, his face was unshaven, his dress dirty and slovenly and\nhis whole appearance and attitude suggested ruin and despair. But the\noutward wreck was evidently only an index to the wreck of soul, that had\ngone on. Out of the dark-blue eyes there shone no inner light. The\nbright, brave, cheery old soldier was gone, and in his place the figure\nof disorder and despair. He looked up at our entering, then turned from\nus, shrinking, and put his hands to his face, swaying to and fro and\ngroaning deeply.\n\nMcFarquhar had come prepared to adopt strong measures, but the sight of\nOuld Michael, besotted and broken, was more than he could stand.\n\n\"Michael, man!\" he cried, amazement and grief in his voice. \"Aw,\nMichael, man! What's this? What's this?\"\n\nHe went to him and laid his big bony hand on Ould Michael's shoulder. At\nhis words and touch the old man broke into sobbing, terrible to see.\n\n\"Whisht, man,\" said McFarquhar, as he might to a child, \"whist, whist,\nlad! It will be well with you yet.\"\n\nBut Ould Michael could not be comforted, but sobbed on and on. A man's\nweeping has something terrible in it, but an old man's tears are hardest\nof all to bear. McFarquhar stood helpless for some moments; then, taking\nOuld Michael by the arm, he said:\n\n\"Come out of this, anyway! Come out!\"\n\nBut it was long before Ould Michael would talk. He sat in silence while\nhis friend discoursed to him about the folly of allowing Paddy to\ndeceive him with bad whisky. Surely any man could tell the bad from the\ngood.\n\n\"It is deplorable stuff altogether, and it will not be good for Paddy\nwhen I see him.\"\n\n\"Och!\" burst out Ould Michael at last, \"it is not the whisky at all, at\nall.\"\n\n\"Ay, that is a great part of it, whatever.\"\n\n\"Och! me hea-art is broke, me hea-art is broke,\" groaned Ould Michael.\n\n\"Hoots, man! is it for the p'stoffice? That was not much worth to any\nman.\"\n\nBut Ould Michael only shook his head. It was hopeless to try to make\nsuch a man appreciate his feelings. McFarquhar rambled on, making light\nof the whole affair. The loss could only be very trifling. A man could\nmake much more out of anything else. Poor Ould Michael bore it as long\nas he could and then, rising to his feet, cried out:\n\n\"Howly mither av Moses! an' have ye no hea-art inside av ye at all, at\nall? 'Tis not the money; the money is dirt!\"\n\nHere McFarquhar strongly dissented. Ould Michael heeded him not, but\npoured out his bitterness and grief. \"For twinty years and more did I\nfolly the flag in all lands and in all climates, wid wounds all over me\nbody, an' medals an' good conduct sthripes an'--an' all that; an' now,\nwid niver a word av complaint or explanashun, to be turned aff like a\ndog an' worse.\"\n\nThen the matter-of-fact McFarquhar, unable to understand these\nsentimental considerations, but secretly delighted that he had got Ould\nMichael to unbosom himself, began to draw him.\n\n\"Not twenty years, Michael.\"\n\n\"Twenty-foive years it is, an' more, I'm tellin' ye,\" replied Ould\nMichael, \"an' niver wance did the inimy see the back av me coat or the\ndust av me heels; an' to think----\"\n\n\"How long was it, then, you were with Sir Colin?\" continued McFarquhar,\ncunningly.\n\n\"Wid Sir Colin? Shure an' didn't I stay wid him all the way from\nCalcutta to Lucknow an' back? An' didn't I give thim faithful sarvice\nhere for twelve years--the first man that iver handled the mail in the\nvalley? An' here I am, like--like--any common man.\"\n\nThese were the sore spots in his heart. He was shamed before the people\nof the valleys in whose presence he had stood forth as the\nrepresentative of a grateful sovereign. His Queen and his country--his\nglory and pride for all these years--had forgotten him and his years of\nservice and had cast him aside as worthless; and now he was degraded to\nthe ranks of a mere private citizen! No wonder he had hauled down his\nflag and then, having no interest in life, nothing was left him but\nPaddy Dougan and the relief of his bad whisky.--Against Jacob Wragge,\ntoo, who had supplanted him, his rage burned. He would have his heart's\nblood yet.\n\nMcFarquhar, as he listened, began to realize how deep was the wound his\nold friend had suffered; but all he could say was, \"You will come out\nwith me Michael, and a few weeks out with the dogs will put you right,\"\nbut Ould Michael was immovable and McFarquhar, bidding me care for him\nand promising to return next week, rode off much depressed. Before the\nweek was over, however, he was back again with great news and in a\nstate of exaltation.\n\n\"The minister is coming,\" he announced.\n\n\"Minister?\"\n\n\"Ay, he has been with me. The Rev. John Macleod\" (or as he made it,\n\"Magleod\") \"from Inverness--and he is the grand man! He has the gift.\"\n\nI remembered that he was a highlander and knew well what he meant.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" he continued with his strongest accent, \"he has been with\nme, and very faithfully has he dealt with me. Oh! he is the man of God,\nand I hev not heard the likes of him for forty years and more.\"\n\nI listened with wonder, as McFarquhar described the visit of the Rev.\nJohn Macleod to his home. I could easily imagine the close dealing\nbetween the minister and McFarquhar, who would give him all reverence\nand submission, but when I imagined the highland minister dealing\nfaithfully with the Indian wife and mother and her boys I failed\nutterly.\n\n\"He could not make much of her,\" meaning his wife, \"and the lads,\" said\nMcFarquhar sadly, \"but there it was that he came very close to myself;\nand indeed--indeed--my sins have found me out.\"\n\n\"What did is say to you? What sins of yours did he discover?\" I asked,\nfor McFarquhar was the most respectable man in all the valley.\n\n\"Oh did he not ask me about my family altar and my duties to my wife and\nchildren?\"\n\nThere was no manner of doubt but Mr. Macleod had done some searching in\nMcFarquhar's heart and had brought him under \"deep conviction,\" as he\nsaid himself. And McFarquhar had great faith that the minister would do\nthe same for Ould Michael and was indignant when I expressed my doubts.\n\n\"Man aliou\" (alive), he cried, \"he will make his fery bones to quake.\"\n\n\"I don't know that that will help him much,\" I replied. But McFarquhar\nonly looked at me and shook his head pityingly.\n\nOn Saturday, sure enough, McFarquhar arrived with the minister, and a\nservice for the day following was duly announced. We took care that Ould\nMichael should be in fit condition to be profited by the Rev. John\nMacleod's discourse. The service was held in the blacksmith's shop, the\nlargest building available. The minister was a big, dark man with a\nmassive head and a great, rolling voice which he used with tremendous\neffect in all the parts of his service. The psalm he sang mostly alone,\nwhich appeared to trouble him not at all. The scripture lesson he read\nwith a rhythmic, solemn cadence that may have broken every rule of\nelocution, but was nevertheless most impressive. His prayer, during\nwhich McFarquhar stood, while all the rest sat, was a most extraordinary\nproduction. In a most leisurely fashion it pursued its course through a\nwhole system of theology, with careful explanation at critical places,\nlest there should be any mistaking of his position. Then it proceeded to\ndeal with all classes and condition of men, from the Queen downward. As\nto McFarquhar, it was easy to see from his face that the prayer was only\nanother proof that the minister had \"the gift,\" but to the others, who\nhad never had McFarquhar's privilege, it was only a marvelous, though\nimpressive performance. Before he closed, however, he remembered the\npeople before him and, in simple, strong, heart-reaching words, he\nprayed for their salvation.\n\n\"Why, in Heaven's name,\" I said afterwards to McFarquhar, \"didn't he\nbegin his prayer where he ended? Does he think the Almighty isn't posted\nin theology?\" But McFarquhar would only reply: \"Ay, it was grand? He has\nthe gift!\"\n\nThe sermon was, as McFarquhar said, \"terrible powerful.\" The text I\nforget, but it gave the opportunity for an elaborate proof of the\nuniversal depravity of the race and of their consequent condemnation. He\nhad no great difficulty in establishing the first position to the\nsatisfaction of his audience, and the effect produced was\ncorrespondingly slight; but when he came to describe the meaning and the\nconsequences of condemnation, he grew terrible, indeed. His pictures\nwere lurid in the extreme. No man before him but was greatly stirred up.\nSome began to move uneasily in their seats; some tried to assume\nindifference; some were openly enraged; but none shared McFarquhar's\nvisible and solemn delight. Ould Michael's face showed nothing; but,\nafter all was over, in answer to McFarquhar's enthusiastic exclamation\nhe finally grunted out:\n\n\"A great sermon, is it? P'raps it was and p'raps it wasn't. It took him\na long time to tell a man what he knew before.\"\n\n\"And what might that be?\" asked McFarquhar.\n\n\"That he was goin' fast to the Divil.\"\n\nThis McFarquhar could not deny and so he fell into disappointed silence.\nHe began to fear that the minister might possibly fail with Ould\nMichael, after all. I frankly acknowledged the same fear and tried to\nmake him see that for men like Ould Michael, and the rest, preaching of\nthat kind could do little good. With this position McFarquhar warmly\ndisagreed, but as the week went by he had to confess that on Ould\nMichael the minister had no effect at all, for he kept out of his way\nand demoted himself to Paddy Dougan as far as we would allow him.\n\nThen McFarquhar began to despair and to realize how desperate is the\nbusiness of saving a man fairly on the way to destruction. But help came\nto us--\"a mysterious dispensation of Providence,\" McFarquhar called it.\nIt happened on the Queen's birthday, when Grand Bend, in excess of loyal\nfervor, was doing its best to get speedily and utterly drunk. In other\ndays Ould Michael had gloried beyond all in the display of loyal spirit;\nbut to-day he sat, dark and scowling, in Paddy Dougan's barroom.\nMcFarquhar and I were standing outside the door keeping an eye, but not\ntoo apparently, upon Ould Michael's drinking.\n\nA big German from the tie-camps, who had lived some years across the\nborder, and not to his advantage, was holding forth in favor of liberty\nand against all tyrannous governments. As Paddy's whisky began to tell\nthe German became specially abusive against Great Britain and the\nQueen. Protests came from all sides, till, losing his temper, the\nGerman gave utterance to a foul slander against Her Majesty's private\nlife. In an instant Ould Michael was on his feet and at the bar.\n\n\"Dhrink all around!\" he cried. The glares were filled and all stood\nwaiting. \"Gentlemen,\" said Ould Michael, in his best manner; \"I give you\nHer Gracious Majesty the Queen, God bless her!\" With wild yells the\nglasses were lifted high and the toast drunk with three times three. The\nGerman, meantime, stood with his glass untouched. When the cheers were\nover he said, with a sneer:\n\n\"Shentlemen, fill ub!\" The order was obeyed with alacrity.\n\n\"I gif you, 'our noble selfs,' and for de Queen\" (using a vile epithet),\n\"she can look after her ownself.\" Quick as thought Ould Michael raised\nhis glass and flung its contents into the German's face, saying, as he\ndid so: \"God save the Queen!\" With a roar the German was at him, and\nbefore a hand could be raised to prevent it, Ould Michael was struck to\nthe floor and most brutally kicked. By this time McFarquhar had tossed\nback the crowd right and left and, stooping down, lifted Ould Michael\nand carried him out into the air, saying in a husky voice:\n\n\"He is dead! He is dead!\"\n\nBut in a moment the old man opened his eyes and said faintly:\n\n\"Niver a bit av it, God save----\"\n\nHis eyes closed again and he became unconscious. They gave him brandy\nand he began to revive. Then McFarquhar rose and looked round for the\nGerman. His hair was fairly bristling round his head; his breath came in\nshort gasps and his little eyes were blood-shot with fury.\n\n\"You have smitten an old man and helpless,\" he panted, \"and you ought to\nbe destroyed from the face of the earth; but I will not smite you as I\nwould a man, but as I would a wasp.\"\n\nHe swung his long arm like a flail and, with his open hand, smote the\nGerman on the side of the head. It was a terrific blow; under it the\nGerman fell to the earth with a thud. McFarquhar waited a few moments\nwhile the German rose, slowly spitting out broken teeth and blood.\n\n\"Will you now behave yourself,\" said McFarquhar, moving toward him.\n\n\"Yes, yes, it is enough,\" said his antagonist hurriedly and went into\nthe saloon.\n\nWe carried Ould Michael to his cabin and laid him on his bed. He was\nsuffering dreadfully from some inward wound, but he uttered not a word\nof complaint. After he had lain still for some time he looked at\nMcFarquhar.\n\n\"What is it, lad?\" asked McFarquhar.\n\n\"The flag,\" whispered poor Ould Michael.\n\n\"The flag? Do you want the flag?\"\n\nHe shook his head slowly, still looking beseechingly at his friend. All\nat once it came to me.\n\n\"You want the flag hauled up, Michael?\" I said.\n\nHe smiled and eagerly looked towards me.\n\n\"I'll run it up at once,\" I said.\n\nHe moved his hand. I came to him and bending over him caught the words\n\"God save----\"\n\n\"All right,\" I answered, \"I shall give it all honor.\"\n\nHe smiled again, closed his eyes and a look of great peace came upon his\nface. His quarrel with his Queen and country was made up and all the\nbitterness was gone from his heart. After an examination as full as I\ncould make, I came to the conclusion that there were three ribs broken\nand an injury, more or less serious, to the lungs; but how serious, I\ncould not tell. McFarquhar established himself in Ould Michael's cabin\nand nursed him day and night. He was very anxious that the minister\nshould see Ould Michael and, when the day came for Mr. Macleod's service\nin Grand Bend, I brought him to Ould Michael's cabin, giving him the\nwhole story on the way. His highland loyalty was stirred.\n\n\"Noble fellow,\" he said, warmly, \"it is a pity he is a Romanist; a sore\npity.\"\n\nHis visit to Ould Michael was not a success. Even McFarquhar had to\nconfess that somehow his expounding of the way of salvation to Ould\nMichael and his prayers, fervent though they were, did not appeal to the\nold soldier; the matter confused and worried him. But however much he\nfailed with Ould Michael there was no manner of doubt that he was\nsucceeding with McFarquhar. Long and earnest were their talks and, after\nevery \"season,\" McFarquhar came forth more deeply impressed with the\ngrand powers of the minister. He Had already established the \"family\naltar\" in his home and was making some slow progress in instructing his\nwife and children in \"the doctrine of grace,\" but as Ould Michael began\nto grow stronger, McFarquhar's anxiety about _his state_ grew deeper.\nAgain and again he had the minister in to him, but Ould Michael remained\nunmoved; indeed, he could hardly see what the minister would be at.\n\nOne evening as we three were sitting in Ould Michael's main room,\nMcFarquhar ventured to express his surprise at Ould Michael's continued\n\"darkness\" as he said:\n\n\"My friend,\" said the minister, solemnly, \"it has been given me that\nyou are the man to lead him into the light.\"\n\n\"God pity me!\" exclaimed McFarquhar. \"That I could lead any man!\"\n\n\"And more,\" said the minister, in deepening tones, \"it is borne in upon\nme that his blood will be upon you.\"\n\nMcFarquhar's look of horror and fear was pitiable and his voice rose in\nan agony of appeal.\n\n\"God be merciful to me! you will not be saying such a word as that.\"\n\n\"Fear not,\" replied the minister, \"he will be given to you for a jewel\nin your crown.\"\n\nMcFarquhar was deeply impressed.\n\n\"How can this thing be?\" he inquired in despair.\n\n\"You are his friend!\" The minister's voice rose and fell in solemn\nrhythm. \"You are strong; he is weak. You will need to put away from you\nall that causeth your brother to offend, and so you will lead him into\nthe light.\"\n\nThe minister's face was that of a man seeing visions and McFarquhar,\ndeeply moved, bowed his head and listened in silence. After a time he\nsaid, hesitatingly:\n\n\"And Ould Michael has his weakness and he will be drinking Paddy\nDougan's bad whisky; but if he would only keep to the Company's good\nwhisky----\"\n\n\"Man,\" interrupted the minister, simply, \"don't you know it is the good\nwhisky that kills, for it is the good whisky that makes men love it.\"\n\nMcFarquhar gazed at him in amazement.\n\n\"The good whisky!\"\n\n\"Ay,\" said the minister, firmly, \"and indeed there is no good whisky for\ndrinking.\"\n\nMcFarquhar rose and from a small cupboard brought back a bottle of the\nHudson Bay Company's brand. \"There,\" he said, pouring out a glass, \"you\nwill not be saying there is no good whisky.\"\n\nThe minister lifted the glass and smelled it.\n\n\"Try it,\" said McFarquhar in triumph.\n\nThe minister put it to his lips.\n\n\"Ay,\" he said, \"I know it well! It is the best, but it is also the\nworst. For this men have lost their souls. There is no good whisky for\n_drinking_, I'm saying.\"\n\n\"And what for, then?\" asked McFarquhar faintly.\n\n\"Oh, it has its place as a medicine or a lotion.\"\n\n\"A lotion,\" gasped McFarquhar.\n\n\"Yes, in case of sprains--a sprained ankle, for instance.\"\n\n\"A lotion!\" gasped McFarquhar; \"and would you be using the good whisky\nto wash your feet with?\"\n\nThe minister smiled; but becoming immediately grave, he answered: \"Mr.\nMcFarquhar, how long have you been in the habit of taking whisky?\"\n\n\"Fifty years,\" said McFarquhar promptly.\n\n\"And how many times have you given the bottle to your friend?\"\n\n\"Indeed, I cannot say,\" said McFarquhar; \"but it has never hurt him\nwhatever.\"\n\n\"Wait a bit. Do you think that perhaps if Michael had never got the good\nwhisky from his good friends he might not now be where he is?\"\n\nMcFarquhar was silent. The minister rose to go.\n\n\"Mr. McFarquhar, the Lord has a word for you\" (McFarquhar rose and stood\nas he always stood in church), \"and it is this: 'We, then, that are\nstrong, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please\nourselves.' It is not given to me to deliver Michael from the bondage of\ndeath, but to you it is given, and of you He will demand, 'Where is\nAbel, thy Brother?'\"\n\nThe minister's last words rolled forth like words of doom.\n\n\"Man, it is terrible!\" said McFarquhar to me as the minister disappeared\ndown the slope; but he never thought of rejecting the burden of\nresponsibility laid upon him. That he had helped Ould Michael down he\nwould hardly acknowledge, but the minister's message bore in upon him\nheavily. \"Where is Abel, thy brother?\" he kept saying to himself. Then\nhe took up the bottle and, holding it up to the light, he said with\ngreat deliberation:\n\n\"There will be no more of you whatever!\"\n\nFrom that time forth McFarquhar labored with Ould Michael with a\npatience and a tact that amazed me. He did not try to instill theology\ninto the old man's mind, but he read to him constantly the gospel\nstories and followed his reading with prayer--always in Gaelic, however,\nfor with this Ould Michael found no fault as to him it was no new thing\nto hear prayers in a foreign tongue. But one day McFarquhar ventured a\nstep in advance.\n\n\"Michael,\" he said timidly, \"you will need to be prayin' for yourself.\"\n\n\"Shure an' don't I inthrate the Blessed Virgin to be doin' that same for\nme?\"\n\nMcFarquhar had learned to be very patient with his \"Romish errors,\" so\nhe only replied:\n\n\"Ay, but you must take words upon your own lips,\" he said, earnestly.\n\n\"An' how can I, then, for niver a word do I know?\"\n\nThen McFarquhar fell into great distress and looked at me imploringly. I\nrose and went into the next room, closing the door behind me. Then,\nthough I tried to make a noise with the chairs, there rose the sound of\nMcFarquhar's voice; but not with the cadence of the Gaelic prayer. He\nhad no gift in the English language, he said; but evidently Ould Michael\nthought otherwise, for he cared no more for Gaelic prayers.\n\nBy degrees McFarquhar began to hope that Ould Michael would come to the\nlight, but there was a terrible lack in the old soldier of \"conviction\nof sin.\" One day, however, in his reading he came to the words, \"the\nCaptain of our Salvation.\"\n\n\"Captain, did ye say?\" said Ould Michael.\n\n\"Ay, Captain!\" said McFarquhar, surprised at the old man's eager face.\n\n\"And what's his rigimint?\"\n\nThen McFarquhar, who had grown quick in following Ould Michael's\nthoughts, read one by one all the words that picture the Christian life\nas a warfare, ending up with that grand outburst of that noblest of\nChristian soldiers, \"I have fought the fight, I have kept the faith.\"\nThe splendid loyalty of it appealed to Ould Michael.\n\n\"McFarquhar,\" he said with quivering voice, \"I don't understand much\nthat ye've been sayin' to me, but if the war is still goin' on, an' if\nhe's afther recruits any more bedad it's mesilf wud like to join.\"\n\nMcFarquhar was now at home; vividly he set before Ould Michael the\nwarfare appointed unto men against the world, the flesh and the Devil;\nand then, with a quick turn, he said:\n\n\"An' He is calling to all true men, 'Follow me!'\"\n\n\"An' wud He have the like av me?\" asked Ould Michael, doubtfully.\n\n\"Ay, that He would and set you some fightin'.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Ould Michael, \"I'm wid Him.\" And no soldier in that warfare\never donned the uniform with simpler faith or wore it with truer heart\nthan did Ould Michael.\n\nMeantime I had, through political friends, set things in motion at\nOttawa for the reinstating of Ould Michael in his position as postmaster\nat Grand Bend, and this, backed up by a petition, which through\nMcFarquhar's efforts bore the name of every old-timer in the valleys,\nbrought about the desired end. So one bright day, when Ould Michael was\nsunning himself on his porch, the stage drove up to his door and, as in\nthe old days, dropped the mail-bag. Ould Michael stood up and, waving\nhis hand to the driver, said:\n\n\"Shure, ye've made a mistake; an' I'm not blamin' ye.\"\n\n\"Not much,\" said the driver. \"I always bring my mail to the postmaster.\"\n\n\"Hurrah!\" I sung out. \"God save the Queen!\"\n\nThe little crowd that had gathered round took up my cheer.\n\n\"What do ye mean, byes?\" said Ould Michael, weakly.\n\n\"It means,\" said McFarquhar, \"that if you have the strength you must\nlook after your mail as the postmaster should.\"\n\nThere was a joyous five minutes of congratulation; then the precession\nformed as before and, led by Ould Michael, marched into the old cabin.\nWith trembling fingers Ould Michael cut the strings and selected his\nletter--\n\n\"But there'll be no more celebration, byes,\" he said, nor was there.\n\nStandardized punctuation.\nLeft one instance of clasp-knife and one of clasp knife.\nPage 10: Changed tell to tall.\nPage 29: Changed extarordinary to extraordinary.]",
