    "body": "1898\n\n\nIt is a village street, with great elms on either side, while along the\nmiddle stands another row set in a narrow strip of grassy common, so\nthat the street and roadway are in reality double. The dwellings on\neither side are not only widely parted by the broad street, but are\nstill further isolated, each in its large garden of ancient fruit\ntrees. It is four o'clock of a sunny August afternoon, and a quiet,\nSabbath-like but for its lazy voluptuousness, broods over the scene.\nNo carriage, or even pedestrian, has passed for an hour. The occasional\nvoices of children at play in some garden, the latching of a gate far\ndown the street, the dying fall of a drowsy chanticleer, are but the\npunctuation of the poem of summer silence that has been flowing on all\nthe afternoon. Upon the tree-tops the sun blazes brightly, and between\ntheir stems are glimpses of outlying meadows, which simmer in the heat\nas if about to come to a boil. But the shadowed street offers a cool\nand refreshing vista to the eye, and a veritable valley of refuge to the\nparched and dusty traveler along the highway.\n\nOn the broad piazza of one of the quaint old-fashioned houses, behind\na needless screen of climbing woodbine, two girls are whiling away the\nafternoon. One of them is lounging in a lassy rocking-chair, while the\nother sits more primly and is industriously sewing.\n\n\"I suppose you 'll be glad enough to see George when he comes to-night\nto take you back to the city? I'm afraid you find it pretty dull\nhere,\" said the latter, with an intonation of uneasy responsibility\nsufficiently attesting that the brilliant-looking girl opposite was a\nguest.\n\nThat young lady, when addressed, was indulging in a luxurious country\nyawn, an operation by no means to be hurried, but to be fully and lazily\nenjoyed in all its several and long-drawn stages, and as thus practiced\na wonderfully calming and soporific relaxation wholly unknown to the\nfretted denizens of cities, whose yawn is one of irritation and not of\nrest. \"I do so enjoy your Plainfield yawns, Lucy,\" she said when she\nhad quite finished. \"Were you saying that it was a little dull? Well,\nperhaps it is, but then the trees and things seem to be' enjoying\nthemselves so hugely that it would be selfish to make a fuss, even if it\nis n't exactly my kind of fun.\"\n\n\"Your kind of fun is due by the six-o'clock stage, I believe.\"\n\nThe other laughed and said, \"I wish you would n't make another allusion\nto George. I think of him so much that I 'm ashamed, as it is.\nI 'm sure this is a very aggravating place for an engaged girl to be\nat. One gets so dreadfully sentimental with nothing to take up the\nmind, especially with such monstrous moons as you have. I got fairly\nfrightened of the one last night. It drew me out through my eyes like a\nbig plaster.\"\n\n\"Mabel French!\"\n\n\"I don't care; it did. That was just the feeling.\"\n\nThere was no hurry about talking, for the rich, mellow summer silence\nhad a body to it that prevented pauses from seeming empty, and it might\nhave been half an hour afterward that Mabel suddenly leaned forward,\nputting her face close to the vine-trellis, and cried in a low voice,\n\"Who's that? Po tell me! They're the very first persons who have gone by\nthis afternoon, I do believe.\"\n\nA pretty phaeton was slowly passing, containing an elderly gentleman and\nlady.\n\n\"Oh, that is only Lawyer Morgan and old Miss Rood,\" replied Lucy, just\nglancing up, and then down again. \"They go out driving once a week\nregularly, and always at about this time in the afternoon.\"\n\n\"They look like afternoon sort of people,\" said Mabel. \"But why does n't\nLawyer Morgan take out his wife?\"\n\n\"He has n't got any. Miss Rood comes nearest to that. Oh, no, you\nneedn't open your eyes; there's not a properer old maid in town, or old\nbachelor either, for that matter.\"\n\n\"Are they relatives?\"\n\n\"No, indeed.\"\n\n\"How long has this Platonic romance been going on, pray?\"\n\n\"Oh, ever since they were young,--forty years, perhaps. I only know by\ntradition, you see. It began ages before my day. They say she was very\npretty once. Old Aunty Perkins remembers that she was quite the belle of\nthe village as a girl. It seems strange, does n't it?\"\n\n\"Tell me the whole story,\" said Mabel, turning round so as to face Lucy\nas the phaeton passed out of sight.\n\n\"There's not much to tell. Mr. Morgan has always lived here, and so has\nMiss Rood. He lives alone with a housekeeper in that fine house at the\nend of the street, and she entirely alone in that little white house\nover there among the apple-trees. All the people who knew them when they\nwere young are dead, gone away, or moved off. They are relics of a\npast generation, and are really about as much shut up to each other for\nsympathy as an old married couple.\"\n\n\"Well, why on earth are n't they married?\"\n\n\"People hereabouts got tired of asking that full thirty years ago,\"\nreplied Lucy, with a little shrug. \"Even the gossips long since wore\nout the subject, and I believe we have all of us forgotten that there\nis anything peculiar about their relations. He calls on her two or three\ntimes a week, and takes her out driving on pleasant days; escorts her\nto places of amusement or social gatherings when either of them cares\nto go, which is n't often; and wherever they are, people take it for\ngranted they will pair off together. He is never seen with any other\nlady.\"\n\n\"It's very strange,\" said Mabel thoughtfully, \"and I'm sure it's very\nromantic. Queer old couple! I wonder how they really feel toward each\nother, and whether they would n't like to be married?\"\n\nAwhile after she suddenly demanded, \"Don't you think Miss Rood looks\nlike me?\"\n\nLucy laughed at first, but upon closer inspection of the fair questioner\nadmitted that there might be some such resemblance as the shriveled\napples brought up from the cellar in spring bear to the plump,\nrosy-cheeked beauties that went down in October.\n\nIf Mr. Morgan and Miss Rood, as they rode past, had chanced to overhear\nMabel's question why they had not married, it would have affected them\nvery differently. He would have been startled by the novelty of an idea\nthat had not occurred to him in twenty years, but the blush on her cheek\nwould have been one of painful consciousness.\n\nAs boy and girl they had been each other's chosen companion, and as\nyoung man and maiden their childish preference had bloomed into a\nreciprocal love. Thanks to the freedom and simplicity of village\nlife, they enjoyed as lovers a constant and easy familiarity and daily\nassociation almost as complete in sympathy of mind and heart as anything\nmarriage could offer. There were none of the usual obstacles to incite\nthem to matrimony. They were never even formally engaged, so wholly did\nthey take it for granted that they should marry. It was so much a matter\nof course that there was no hurry at all about it; and besides, so\nlong as they had it to look forward to, the foreground of life\nwas illuminated for them: it was still morning. Mr. Morgan was\nconstitutionally of a dreamy and unpractical turn, a creature of habits\nand a victim of ruts; and as years rolled on he became more and more\nsatisfied with these half-friendly, half-loverlike relations. He never\nfound the time when it seemed an object to marry, and now, for very many\nyears, the idea had not even occurred to him as possible; and so far\nwas he from the least suspicion that Miss Rood's experience had not been\nprecisely similar to his own, that he often congratulated himself on the\nfortunate coincidence.\n\nTime cures much, and many years ago Miss Hood had recovered from the\nfirst bitterness of discovering that his love had become insensibly\ntransformed into a very tender but perfectly peaceful friendship. No\none but him had ever touched her heart, and she had no interest in life\nbesides him. Since she was not to be his wife, she was glad to be his\nlifelong, tender, self-sacrificing friend. So she raked the ashes over\nthe fire in her heart, and left him to suppose that it had gone out as\nin his. Nor was she without compensation in their friendship. It was\nwith a delightful thrill that she felt how fully in mind and heart he\nleaned and depended upon her, and the unusual and romantic character of\ntheir relations in some degree consoled her for the disappointment of\nwomanly aspirations by a feeling of distinction. She was not like other\nwomen: her lot was set apart and peculiar. She looked down upon her sex.\nThe conventionality of women's lives renders their vanity peculiarly\nsusceptible to a suggestion that their destiny is in any respect unique,\n--a fact that has served the turn of many a seducer before now. To-day,\nafter returning from his drive with Miss Rood, Mr. Morgan had walked\nin his garden, and as the evening breeze arose, it bore to his nostrils\nthat first indescribable flavor of autumn which warns us that the soul\nof Summer has departed from her yet glowing body. He was very sensitive\nto these changes of the year, and, obeying an impulse that had been\nfamiliar to him in all unusual moods his life long, he left the house\nafter tea and turned his steps down the street. As he stopped at Miss\nRood's gate, Lucy, Mabel, and George Hammond were under the apple-trees\nin the garden opposite.\n\n\"Look, Mabel! There's Mr. Morgan going to call on Miss Rood,\" said Lucy\nsoftly.\n\n\"Oh, do look, George!\" said Mabel eagerly. \"That old gentleman has been\npaying court to an old maid over in that little house for forty years.\nAnd to think,\" she added in a lower tone, intended for his private ear,\n\"what a fuss you make about waiting six months!\"\n\n\"Humph! You please to forget that it's easier to wait for some things\nthan for others. Six months of my kind of waiting, I take it, require\nmore patience than forty years of his--or any other man's,\" he added,\nwith increased emphasis.\n\n\"Be quiet, sir!\" replied Mabel, answering his look of unruly admiration\nwith one of half pique. \"I 'm not a sugar-plum, that's not enjoyed till\nit's in the mouth. If you have n't got me now, you 'll never have me. If\nbeing engaged isn't enough, you don't deserve to be married.\" And then,\nseeing the blank expression with which he looked down at her, she\nadded with a prescient resigned-ness, \"I 'm afraid, dear, you 'll be so\ndisappointed when we 're married, if you find this so tedious.\"\n\nLucy had discreetly wandered away, and of how they made it up there were\nno witnesses. But it seems likely that they did so, for shortly after\nthey wandered away together down the darkening street.\n\nLike most of the Plainfield houses, that at which Mr. Morgan turned\nin stood well back from the street. At a side window, still further\nsheltered from view by a gyringa-bush at the house corner, sat a little\nwoman with a small, pale face, the still attractive features perceptibly\nsharpened by years, of which the half-gray hair bore further testimony.\nThe eyes, just now fixed absently upon the dusking landscape, were light\ngray and a little faded, while around the lips there were crow's-feet,\nespecially when they were pressed together, as now, in an unsatisfied,\nalmost pathetic look, evidently habitual to her face when in repose.\nThere was withal something in her features that so reminded you of Mr.\nMorgan that any one conversant with the facts of his life-romance would\nhave at once inferred--though by just what logic he might not be\nable to explain--that this must be Miss Eood. It is well known that\nlong-wedded couples often gain at length a certain resemblance in\nfeature and manner; and although these two were not married, yet their\nintimacy of a lifetime was perhaps the reason why her face bore when in\nrepose something of that seer-like expression which communion with the\nbodiless shapes of memory had given to his.\n\nThe latching of the gate broke up her depressing reverie, and banished\nthe pinched and pining look from her features. Among the neighbors Miss\nRood was sometimes called a sour old maid, but the face she kept for\nMr. Morgan would never have suggested that idea to the most ill-natured\ncritic.\n\nHe stopped at the window, near which the walk passed to the doorway, and\nstood leaning on the sill,--a tall, slender figure, stooping a\nlittle, with smooth, scholarly face, and thin iron-gray hair. His\nonly noticeable feature was a pair of eyes whose expression and glow\nindicated an imaginative temperament. It was pleasant to observe the\nrelieved restlessness in the look and manner of the two friends, as if\nat the mere being in each other's presence, though neither seemed in any\nhaste to exchange even the words of formal greeting.\n\nAt length she said, in a tone of quiet satisfaction, \"I knew you\nwould come, for I was sure this deathly autumn's flavor would make you\nrestless. Is n't it strange how it affects the nerves of memory, and\nmakes one sad with thinking of all the sweet, dear days that are dead?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" he answered eagerly; \"I can think of nothing else. Do they\nnot seem wonderfully clear and near to-night? To-night, of all nights\nin the year, if the figures and scenes of memory can be reembodied in\nvisible forms, they ought to become so to the eyes that strain and yearn\nfor them.\"\n\n\"What a fanciful idea, Robert!\"\n\n\"I don't know that it is; I don't feel sure. Nobody understands the\nmystery of this Past, or what are the conditions of existence in that\nworld. These memories, these forms and faces, that are so near, so\nalmost warm and visible that we find ourselves smiling on the vacant air\nwhere they seem to be, are they not real and living?\"\n\n\"You don't mean you believe in ghosts?\"\n\n\"I am not talking of ghosts of the dead, but of ghosts of the past,--\nmemories of scenes or persons, whether the persons are dead or not--\nof our own selves as well as others. Why,\" he continued, his voice\nsoftening into a passionate, yearning tenderness, \"the figure I would\ngive most to see just once more is yourself as a girl, as I remember you\nin the sweet grace and beauty of your maidenhood. Ah, well! ah, well!\"\n\n\"Don't!\" she cried involuntarily, while her features contracted in\nsudden pain.\n\nIn the years during which his passion for her had been cooling into a\nstaid friendship, his imagination had been recurring with constantly\nincreasing fondness and a dreamy passion to the memory of her\ngirlhood. And the cruelest part of it was that he so unconsciously and\nunquestioningly assumed that she could not have identity enough with\nthat girlish ideal to make his frequent glowing references to it even\nembarrassing. Generally, however, she heard and made no sign, but the\nsuddenness of his outburst just now had taken her off her guard.\n\nHe glanced up with some surprise at her exclamation, but was too much\ninterested in his subject to take much notice of it. \"You know,\" he\nsaid, \"there are great differences in the distinctness with which we\ncan bring up our memories. Very well! The only question is, What is the\nlimit to that distinctness, or is there any? Since we know there are\nsuch wide degrees in distinctness, the burden of proof rests on those\nwho would prove that those degrees stop short of any particular point.\nDon't you see, then, that it might be possible to see them?\" And to\nenforce his meaning he laid his hand lightly on hers as it rested on the\nwindow-seat.\n\nShe withdrew it instantly from the contact, and a slight flush tinged\nher sallow cheeks. The only outward trace of her memory of their\nyouthful relations was the almost prudish chariness of her person by\nwhich she indicated a sense of the line to be drawn between the former\nlover and the present friend.\n\n\"Something in your look just now,\" he said, regarding her musingly, as\none who seeks to trace the lineaments of a dead face in a living one,\n\"reminds me of you as you used to sit in this very window as a girl,\nand I stood just here, and we picked out stars together. There! now it's\ngone;\" and he turned away regretfully.\n\nShe looked at his averted face with a blank piteousness which revealed\nall her secret. She would not have had him see it for worlds, but it was\na relief just for a moment to rest her features in the sad cast which\nthe muscles had grown tired in repressing. The autumn scent rose\nstronger as the air grew damp, and he stood breathing it in, and\napparently feeling its influence like some Delphian afflatus.\n\n\"Is there anything, Mary,--is there anything so beautiful as that\nlight of eternity that rests on the figures of memory? Who that has once\nfelt it can care for the common daylight of the present any more, or\ntake pleasure in its prosaic groups?\"\n\n\"You'll certainly catch cold standing in that wet grass; do come in and\nlet me shut the blinds,\" she said, for she had found cheerful lamplight\nthe best corrective for his vagaries.\n\nSo he came in and sat in his special arm-chair, and they chatted about\nmiscellaneous village topics for an hour. The standpoint from which they\ncanvassed Plainfield people and things was a peculiarly outside one.\nTheir circle of two was like a separate planet from which they observed\nthe world. Their tone was like, and yet quite unlike, that in which\na long-married couple discuss their acquaintances; for, while their\nintellectual intimacy was perfect, their air expressed a constant mutual\ndeference and solicitude of approbation not to be confounded with the\nterrible familiarity of matrimony; and at the same time they constituted\na self-sufficient circle, apart from the society around them, as man and\nwife cannot. Man and wife are so far merged as to feel themselves a unit\nover against society. They are too much identified to find in each other\nthat sense of support and countenance which requires a feeling of the\nexteriority of our friend's life to our own. If these two should\nmarry, they would shortly find themselves impelled to seek refuge in\nconventional relations with that society of which now they were calmly\nindependent.\n\nAt length Mr. Morgan rose and threw open the blinds. The radiance of the\nfull harvest-moon so flooded the room that Miss Eood was fain to blow\nout the poor lamp for compassion. \"Let us take a walk,\" he said.\n\nThe streets were empty and still, and they walked in silence, spelled by\nthe perfect beauty of the evening. The dense shadows of the elms lent a\npeculiarly rich effect to the occasional bars and patches of moonlight\non the street floor; the white houses gleamed among their orchards; and\nhere and there, between the dark tree-stems, there were glimpses of\nthe shining surface of the broad outlying meadows, which looked like a\nsurrounding sea.\n\nMiss Rood was startled to see how the witchery of the scene possessed\nher companion. His face took on a set, half-smiling expression, and he\ndropped her arm as if they had arrived at the place of entertainment to\nwhich he had been escorting her. He no longer walked with measured pace,\nbut glided along with a certain stealthiness, peering on this side and\nthat down moony vistas and into shadow-bowers, as if half-expecting,\nif he might step lightly enough, to catch a glimpse of some sort of\ndream-people basking there.\n\nNor could Miss Rood herself resist the impression the moony landscape\ngave of teeming with subtle forms of life, escaping the grosser senses\nof human beings, but perceptible by their finer parts. Each cosy nook of\nlight and shadow was yet warm from some presence that had just left it.\nThe landscape fairly stirred with ethereal forms of being beneath the\nfertilizing moon-rays, as the earth-mould wakes into physical life under\nthe sun's heat. The yellow moonlight looked warm as spirits might count\nwarmth. The air was electric with the thrill of circumambient existence.\nThere was the sense of pressure, of a throng. It would have been\nimpossible to feel lonely. The pulsating sounds of the insect world\nseemed the rhythm to which the voluptuous beauty of the night had\nspontaneously set itself. The common air of day had been transmuted\ninto the atmosphere of reverie and Dreamland. In that magic medium the\ndistinction between imagination and reality fast dissolved. Even Miss\nBood was conscious of a delightful excitement, a vague expectancy. Mr.\nMorgan, she saw, was moved quite beyond even his exaggerated habit of\nimaginative excitement. His wet, shining, wide-opened eyes and ecstatic\nexpression indicated complete abandonment to the illusions of the scene.\n\nThey had seated themselves, as the concentration of the brain upon\nimaginative activity made the nerves of motion sluggish, upon a rude\nbench formed by wedging a plank between two elms that stood close\ntogether. They were within the shadow of the trees, but close up to\ntheir feet rippled a lake of moonlight. The landscape shimmering before\nthem had been the theatre of their fifty years of life. Their history\nwas written in its trees and lawns and paths. The very air of the place\nhad acquired for them a dense, warm, sentient feeling, to which that of\nall other places was thin and raw. It had become tinctured by their own\nspiritual emanations, by the thoughts, looks, words and moods of which\nit had so long received the impression. It had become such vitalized\nair, surcharged with sense and thought, as might be taken to make souls\nfor men out of.\n\nOver yonder, upon the playground, yet lingered the faint violet\nfragrance of their childhood. Beneath that elm a kiss had once touched\nthe air with a fire that still warmed their cheeks in passing. Yonder\nthe look of a face was cut on the viewless air as on marble. Surely,\ndeath does but touch the living, for the dead ever keep their power over\nus; it is only we who lose ours over them. Each vista of leafy arch and\ndistant meadow framed in some scene of their youth-time, painted in the\nimperishable hues of memory that borrow from time an ever richer and\nmore glowing tint. It was no wonder that to these two old people,\nsitting on the bench between the elms, the atmosphere before them,\nsaturated with associations, dense with memories, should seem fairly\nquivering into material forms, like a distant mist turning to rain.\n\nAt length Miss Rood heard her companion say, in a whisper of tremulous\nexultation, \"Do you know, Mary, I think I shall see them very soon.\"\n\n\"See whom?\" she asked, frightened at his strange tone.\n\n\"Why, see us, of course, as I was telling you,\" he whispered,--\"you\nand me as we were young,--see them as I see you now. Don't you remember\nit was just along here that we used to walk on spring evenings? We walk\nhere no more, but they do evermore, beautiful, beautiful children. I\ncome here often to lie in wait for them. I can feel them now; I can\nalmost, almost see them.\" His whisper became scarcely audible and the\nwords dropped slowly. \"I know the sight is coming, for every day they\ngrow more vivid. It can't be long before I quite see them. It may come\nat any moment.\"\n\nMiss Rood was thoroughly frightened at the intensity of his excitement,\nand terribly perplexed as to what she should do.\n\n\"It may come at any time; I can almost see them now,\" he murmured.\n\"A--h! look!\" With parted lips and unspeakably intense eyes, as if his\nlife were flowing out at them, he was staring across the moonlit paths\nbefore them to the point where the path debouched from the shadow.\n\nFollowing his eyes, she saw what for a moment made her head swim with\nthe thought that she too was going mad. Just issuing from the shadows,\nas if in answer to his words, were a young man and a girl, his arm upon\nher waist, his eyes upon her face. At the first glance Miss Rood was\nimpressed with a resemblance to her own features in those of the girl,\nwhich her excitement exaggerated to a perfect reproduction of them.\nFor an instant the conviction possessed her that by some impossible,\nindescribable, inconceivable miracle she was looking upon the\nresurrected figures of her girlish self and her lover.\n\nAt first Mr. Morgan had half started from his seat, and was between\nrising and sitting. Then he rose with a slow, involuntary movement,\nwhile his face worked terribly between bewilderment and abandonment to\nillusion. He tottered forward a few steps to the edge of the moonlight,\nand stood peering at the approaching couple with a hand raised to shade\nhis eyes and a dazed, unearthly smile on his face. The girl saw him\nfirst, for she had been gazing demurely before her, while her lover\nlooked only at her. At sight of the gray-haired man suddenly confronting\nthem with a look of bedlam, she shrieked and started back in terror.\nMiss Rood, recalled to her senses, sprang forward, and catching Mr.\nMorgan's arm endeavored with gentle force to draw him away.\n\nBut it was too late for that. The young man, at first almost as\nmuch startled as his companion at the uncanny apparition, naturally\nexperienced a revulsion of indignation at such an extraordinary\ninterruption to his tete-a-tete, and stepped up to Mr. Morgan as if\nabout to inflict summary chastisement. But perceiving that he had to do\nwith an elderly man, he contented himself with demanding in a decidedly\naggressive tone what the devil he meant by such a performance.\n\nMr. Morgan stared at him without seeing him, and evidently did not take\nin the words. He merely gasped once or twice, and looked as if he had\nfainted away on his feet. His blank, stunned expression showed that his\nfaculties were momentarily benumbed by the shock. Miss Rood felt as if\nshe should die for the pity of it as she looked at his face, and her\nheart was breaking for grief as she sought to mollify the young man with\nsome inarticulate words of apology, meanwhile still endeavoring to draw\nMr. Morgan away. But at this moment the girl, recovering from her panic,\ncame up to the group and laid her hand on the young man's arm, as if to\ncheck and silence him. It was evident that she saw there was something\nquite unusual in the circumstances, and the look which she bent upon Mr.\nMorgan was one of sympathy and considerate interrogation. But Miss\nRood could see no way out of their awkward situation, which grew more\nintolerable every moment as they thus confronted each other. It was\nfinally Mr. Morgan's voice, quite firm, but with an indescribable\nsadness in the tones, which broke the silence: \"Young people, I owe you\nan apology, such as it is. I am an old man, and the past is growing so\nheavy that it sometimes quite overbalances me. My thoughts have been\nbusy to-night with the days of my youth, and the spell of memory has\nbeen so strong that I have not been quite myself. As you came into view\nI actually entertained the incredible idea for a moment that somehow I\nsaw in you the materialized memories of myself and another as we once\nwalked this same path.\"\n\nThe young man bowed, as Mr. Morgan ended, in a manner indicating his\nacceptance of the apology, although he looked both amazed and amused.\nBut the explanation had a very different effect upon the girl at his\nside. As she listened, her eyes had filled with tears, and her face had\ntaken on a wonderfully tender, pitiful smile. When he ended speaking,\nshe impulsively said, \"I 'm so sorry we were not what you thought us!\nWhy not pretend we are, to-night at least? We can pretend it, you know.\nThe moonlight makes anything possible;\" and then glancing at Miss Rood,\nshe added, as if almost frightened, \"Why, how much we look alike! I 'm\nnot sure it isn't true, anyway.\"\n\nThis was, in fact, an unusually marked example of those casual\nresemblances between strangers which are sometimes seen. The hair of the\none was indeed gray and that of the other dark, but the eyes were of the\nsame color by night, and the features, except for the greater fullness\nof the younger face, were cast in the same mould, while figure and\nbearing were strikingly similar, although daylight would doubtless have\nrevealed diversities, enough that moonlight refused to disclose.\n\nThe two women looked at each other with an expression almost of\nsuspicion and fear, while the young man observed, \"Your mistake was\ncertainly excusable, sir.\"\n\n\"It will be the easier to pretend,\" said the girl, as with a\nhalf-serious, half-sportive imperiousness she laid her hand on Mr.\nMorgan's arm. \"And now it is thirty years ago, and we are walking\ntogether.\" He involuntarily obeyed the slight pressure, and they walked\nslowly away, leaving the other two, after an embarrassed pause, to\nfollow them.\n\nFor some time they walked in silence. He was deliberately abandoning\nhimself to the illusion, supported as it was by the evidence of his\nsenses, that he was wandering in some of the mysterious be-tween-worlds\nwhich he had so often dreamed of, with the love of his youth in her\nyouth-time charm. Did he really believe it to be so? Belief is a term\nquite irrelevant to such a frame as his, in which the reflective\nand analytical powers are for a time purposely held in abeyance. The\ncircumstances of her introduction to him had dropped from his mind as\nirrelevant accidents, like the absurdities which occur in our sweetest\nand most solemn dreams without marring their general impression in our\nmemories. Every glance he threw upon his companion, while on the one\nhand it shocked his illusion in that she seemed not likely to vanish\naway, on the other strengthened it with an indescribable thrill by the\nrevelation of some fresh trait of face or figure, some new expression,\nthat reproduced the Miss Rood of his youth. Not, indeed, that it\nis likely his companion was thus perfectly the double of that lady,\nalthough so much resembling her, but the common graces of maidenhood\nwere in Mr. Morgan's mind the peculiar personal qualities of the only\nwoman he had ever much known.\n\nOf his own accord he would not have dared to risk breaking the charm by\na word. But his companion--who, as is tolerably evident by this time,\nwas Mabel French--had meanwhile formed a scheme quite worthy of her\naudacious temper. She had at once recognized both Mr. Morgan and Miss\nRood, and had gone thus far from a mere romantic impulse, without\ndefinite intentions of any sort. But the idea now came into her head\nthat she might take advantage of this extraordinary situation to try a\nmatch-making experiment, which instantly captivated her fancy. So she\nsaid, while ever so gently pressing his arm and looking up into his face\nwith an arch smile (she was recognized as the best amateur actress in\nher set at home), \"I wonder if the moon will be so mellow after we are\nmarried?\"\n\nHis illusion was rudely disturbed by the shock of an articulate voice,\nsoftly and low as she spoke, and he looked around with a startled\nexpression that made her fear her role was ended. But she could not\nknow that the eyes she turned to his were mirrors where he saw his dead\nyouth. The two Miss Roods--the girl and the woman, the past and the\npresent--were fused and become one in his mind. Their identity flashed\nupon him.\n\nAn artesian well sunk from the desert surface through the underlying\nstrata, the layers of ages, strikes some lake long ago covered over, and\nthe water welling up converts the upper waste into a garden. Just so\nat her words and her look his heart suddenly filled, as if it came from\nafar, with the youthful passion he had felt toward Miss Bood, but which,\nhe knew not exactly when or how, had been gradually overgrown with the\ndullness of familiarity and had lapsed into an indolent affectionate\nhabit. The warm, voluptuous pulse of this new feeling--new, and yet\ninstantly recognized as old--brought with it a flood of youthful\nassociations, and commingled the far past with the present in a\nconfusion more complete and more intoxicating than ever. He saw double\nagain. \"Married!\" he murmured dreamily. \"Yes, surely, we will be\nmarried.\"\n\nAnd as he spoke, he looked at her with such a peculiar expression that\nshe was a little frightened. It looked like a more serious business than\nshe had counted on, and for a moment, if she could have cut and run,\nperhaps she would have done so. But she had a strain of the true\nhistrionic artist about her, and with a little effort rose to the\ndifficulty of the role. \"Of course we will be married,\" she replied,\nwith an air of innocent surprise. \"You speak as if you had just thought\nof it.\"\n\nHe turned toward her as if he would sober his senses by staring at her,\nhis pupils dilating and contracting in the instinctive effort to clear\nthe mind by clearing the eyes.\n\nBut with a steady pressure on his arm she compelled him to walk on by\nher side. Then she said, in a soft, low voice, as if a little awed by\nwhat she were telling, while at the same time she nestled nearer his\nside, \"I had such a sad dream last night, and your strange talk reminds\nme of it. It seemed as if we were old and white-haired and stooping,\nand went wandering about, still together, but not married, lonely and\nbroken. And I woke up feeling you can't think how dreary and sad,--\nas if a bell had tolled in my ears as I slept; and the feeling was so\nstrong that I put my fingers to my face to find if it was withered; and\nwhen I could not tell certainly, I got up and lit my lamp and looked in\nthe glass; and my face, thank God! was fresh and young; but I sat on my\nbed and cried to think of the poor old people I had left behind in my\ndream.\"\n\nMabel had so fallen into the spirit of her part that she was really\ncrying as she ended. Her tears completed Mr. Morgan's mental confusion,\nand he absolutely did not know whom he was addressing or where he was\nhimself, as he cried, \"No, no, Mary! Don't cry! It shall not be; it\nshall never be.\"\n\nLightly withdrawing her hand from his arm, she glided like a sprite from\nhis side, and was lost in the shadows, while her whispered words still\nsounded in his ear, \"Good-by for thirty years!\"\n\nA moment after, three notes, clear as a bird's call, sounded from the\ndirection whither she had vanished, and Miss Rood's companion, breaking\noff short a remark on the excessive dryness of the weather, bowed\nawkwardly and also disappeared among the shadows.\n\nWhen Miss Rood laid her hand on Mr. Morgan's arm to recall him to the\nfact that they were now alone together, he turned quickly, and his\neyes swept her from head to foot, and then rested on her face with an\nexpression of intense curiosity and a wholly new interest, as if he were\ntracing out a suddenly suggested resemblance which overwhelmed him with\nemotion. And as he gazed, his eyes began to take fire from the faded\nfeatures on which they had rested so many years in mere complacent\nfriendliness, and she instinctively averted her face.\n\nLong intimacy had made her delicately sensitive to his moods, and when\nhe drew her arm in his and turned to walk, although he had not uttered a\nword, she trembled with agitation.\n\n\"Mary, we have had an extraordinary experience to-night,\" he said.\nThe old dreaminess in his voice, as of one narcotized or in a trance,\nsometimes a little forced, as of one trying to dream, to which she had\nbecome accustomed, and of which in her heart of hearts she was very\nweary, was gone. In its place she recognized a resonance which still\nfurther confused her with a sense of altered relations. His polarity had\nchanged: his electricity was no longer negative, but positive.\n\nHer feminine instinct vaguely alarmed, she replied, \"Yes, indeed, but\nit is getting late. Had n't we better go in?\" What lent the unusual\nintonation of timidity to her voice? Certainly nothing that she could\nhave explained.\n\n\"Not quite yet, Mary,\" he answered, turning his gaze once more fully\nupon her.\n\nHer eyes dropped before his, and a moment after fluttered up to find an\nexplanation for their behavior, only to fall again in blind panic.\nFor, mingling unmistakably with the curiosity with which he was still\nstudying her features, was a newborn expression of appropriation and\npassionate complacency. Her senses whirled in a bewilderment that had\na suffocating sweetness about it. Though she now kept her eyes on the\nground, she felt his constant sidewise glances, and, desperately seeking\nrelief from the conscious silence that enveloped them like a vapor of\nintoxicating fumes, she forced herself to utter the merest triviality\nshe could summon to her lips: \"See that house.\" The husky tones betrayed\nmore agitation than the ruse concealed.\n\nHe answered as irrelevantly as she had spoken, \"Yes, indeed, so it is.\"\nThat was their only attempt at conversation.\n\nFor a half hour--it might have been much more or much less--they\nwalked in this way, thrilling with the new magnetism that at once\nattracted and estranged them with an extraordinary sense of strangeness\nin familiarity. At length they paused under the little porch of Miss\nRood's cottage, where he commonly bade her good-evening after their\nwalks. The timidity and vague alarms that had paralyzed her while\nthey were walking disappeared as he was about to leave her, and she\ninvoluntarily returned his unusual pressure of her hand.\n\nA long time after, behold her still encircled in his arms, not blushing,\nbut pale and her eyes full of a soft, astonished glow! \"Oh, Robert!\" was\nall she had said after one first little gasp.\n\nThey never met George or Mabel again. Mrs. Morgan learned subsequently\nthat two young people from the city answering their description had been\nguests at the opposite house, and had left Plainfield the morning after\nthe events hereinbefore set forth, and drew her conclusions accordingly.\nBut her husband preferred to cherish the secret belief that his theory\nthat memories might become visible had proved true in one instance at\nleast.",
