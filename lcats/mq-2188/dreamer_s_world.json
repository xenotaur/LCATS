    "body": "_They wanted a world without war. The answer was simple: Stay in bed._\n\n\nA warning hum started somewhere down in the audoviso.\n\nGreg stared. Perspiration crawled down his face. This was it. This was\nthe end of the nightmare. This had to be Pat Nichols.\n\nAfter seventy-two hours in which Greg had had to do without anesthesia!\nSeventy-two hours of reality! Seventy-two hours of _consciousness_!\nConsciousness. Reality.\n\nGreg didn't know how he'd managed to remain sane.\n\nIt seemed incredible that a man who had advanced to Stage Five in\nthe Dream Continuity Scale, and who had been in anesthesia most of\nthe time, could suffer seventy-two hours of boring, drab, dreary and\nrevolting reality. And still be sane.\n\nPat Nichols was the answer. Her body faded into slim and luscious focus\non the three-dim screen. Her brooding eyes and wide mouth that curled\nso reprovingly.\n\nShe had gone psycho. Had fled from the Cowl into the dreadful Outside,\nseventy-two hours ago. Gone to join that fanatical group of Venusian\nColonists, those outlaw schizoids who planned to start over on Venus.\n\n\"Pat!\" Greg's hand reached as though she weren't just a three-dim\nimage. \"Listen, Pat! Thank the Codes, you haven't blasted yet. I've\nbeen crazy, waiting for this call. Pat, I can't even go into integrated\nanesthesia without you around. My dreams don't seem to focus right.\"\n\n\"That's too bad, Greg,\" she said.\n\nHe moistened his lips slowly. He slid his hand toward the warning\nbutton beneath the table. Her eyes didn't notice, never left his face.\nAccusative, sad eyes.\n\nHe felt sick. He pushed the button. Now! Now Drakeson up on the\napartment roof would trace the point of her call. He'd chart her\nlocation with the rhodium tracker beams. Then the two of them would\ngo and pick Pat up and prevent that insane, suicidal, one-way trip to\nVenus.\n\nShe might consider it a very unfair thing, but then she was psycho.\nShe'd be glad of it, after she was brought back, brain-probed, and\nre-conditioned. The thought made Greg even more ill. Brain-probing and\nre-conditioning involved months of a kind of mental agony that no one\ncould adequately describe. The words were enough to give anesthetic\nnightmares to any Citizen. But, it was for the good of the Cowls, and\nof the psychos.\n\nHer voice was sad too, like her eyes. \"I was hoping you would join me,\nGreg. Anyway, I called to tell you that in about five hours, we're\nblasting. This is goodby.\"\n\nHe said something. Anything. Keep her talking, listening. Give Drakeson\na chance to employ the rhodium tracker, and spot her location.\n\nA kind of panic got loose in Greg's brain. \"Pat, don't you have any\ninsight at all? Can't you see that this is advanced psychosis, that--\"\n\nShe interrupted. \"I've tried to explain to you before, Greg. But you've\nalways preferred anesthesia. You loathe reality. But I'm part of\nreality.\"\n\nYes. He had dreams. The anesthetic cubicles, Stage Five where a man was\nmaster of thalamic introjection, dream imagery. A stage where any part\nof reality was supposed to have faded into utter inconsequence. But Pat\nNichols had always been a part of his conditioned personality pattern.\nBy taking her out of it, fate had struck him with an unbalance in\npsyche that disturbed the sole objective of life--to dream.\n\n\"But that's a suicide trip, Pat, and you'll never have a chance to be\ncured of your schizophrenia, even if you do get to Venus--\"\n\nHer interruption had weariness in it.\n\n\"Goodby, Greg. I'm sorry for you. That silly status quo, and futile\ndreaming. It will never let you realize what a fine man you are. You'll\ndecay and die in some futile image. So goodby, Greg. And good dreaming.\"\n\nShe was gone from the screen. Maybe from earth, unless he got out there\nand stopped her before that suicide ship rocketed out from its hidden\nsubterranean blast tube.\n\n\n\nGreg Hurried. He didn't realize he could function so rapidly in the\nworld of physical reality. In seconds he had zipped thin resilient\naerosilk about his body, and was running across the wide plastic mesh\nroof toward the heliocruiser in which Drakeson was waiting.\n\nGreg felt the physical power flow as he ran. It sickened him. The\nconditioners kept the body in good shape, but only to allow the\ncortical-thalamic imagery faculties to function better. Actual physical\nbusiness like this was revolting to any Cowl citizen. Any sort of\nphysical and materialistic activity, divorced from anesthesia, might be\na sign of encroaching psychosis.\n\nThat was the fear. That fear of psychosis that might lead to violence.\nTo change. The Cowls over the Cities protected them from any physical\ninterference with an absolutely stabile, unchanging and static culture.\nBut the Cowls hadn't been able to protect the Citizenry from insanity.\nDuring the past year, psychosis had been striking increasingly, without\nwarning, indiscriminately.\n\nGreg dropped down beside the thin ascetic figure at the controls. He\ngrabbed Drakeson's arm.\n\n\"Did you pick it up, Drake?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" Drakeson drawled. His mouth was cynical, his gray eyes\nsomber. \"Traced it down to a ten meter radius, but it's underground.\nAbout five miles out of Old Washington, just inside the big\nradioactivated forest east of the Ruins. About half an hour's flight as\nthe crow might fly. If there was a crow left.\"\n\n\"Then let's go. Lift this gadget out of here!\"\n\nA spot of nausea bounced into Greg's stomach at Drakeson's reference\nto what the big Chain blow-up had done to almost all high cellular\nlife forms, including crows. Only insects and a few shielded humans\nhad withstood the radiation. Most higher complex cellular organisms\nhad paid for their complexity. But thanks to the establishment of the\nCowled Cities and the Codes of non-change, non-violence, they wouldn't\nhave to pay again. No chance for social change now that might lead to\nanother such disaster.\n\nIf they could only trace the cause for this psychosis epidemic--\n\nGreg hadn't thought about it at all until Pat had started talking\npeculiarly, then when she had broken up completely and left the Cowl,\nthen it had hit home, hard.\n\nThe heliocruiser lifted slowly under Drakeson's awkward guidance. Only\nthe Controllers, the Control Council Guards, could work the gadgetry\nof the City with practiced ease. Everybody else, naturally, was\nconditioned to various anesthesia states, and had no reason to deal\nwith materialistic things.\n\nThe cruiser lifted until it was flying directly beneath the opaque\nstuff of the Cowl, lost in the dazzling rainbows of sunlight shattering\nthrough.\n\nDrakeson said. \"We'll keep up here. Maybe the Controllers won't see us.\"\n\n\"What?\" A peculiar coolness slid along Greg's spine.\n\n\"Maybe they won't see us,\" repeated Drakeson, and then he smiled wryly.\n\"Listen, Greg. You're way ahead of me in the Dream Continuity. You're a\nlot further away from reality than I am. More impractical. So listen to\na word or two before we try to break through the Cowl.\n\n\"We've never been Outside, don't forget that. It's dangerous. You\nhaven't considered any of the angles. For example, I picked up a couple\nof shielding suits which you hadn't thought of. And two small wrist\nGeigers. If I hadn't thought of them, then we'd probably have been\ncontaminated with hard radiation out there, and would have been thrown\ninto the septic pools for about six months.\"\n\nGreg shivered. That would have been very bad.\n\n\"It's deadly out there; poisonous, Greg. Only the insane have wanted\nto go Outside for the last few years, and only the Controllers have\nbeen out, and then only to try to track down the hiding places of the\nColonists. You hadn't considered that, but I did. So I had to steal a\ncouple of heat-blasters, from the Museum....\"\n\n\"You what?\" Greg stared at the two deadly coiled weapons Drakeson\ndragged from beneath the seat. \"Do the Controllers know?\"\n\n\"They've probably found out by now, or will very soon,\" Drakeson looked\ngrim. \"They'll be after us with sky-cars and para-guns. And they're\nsure to slap a psycho label on us. They would anyway, probably, for\njust going Outside. But having destructive forbidden weapons on us,\nthey're sure to, and we couldn't go Outside without weapons, Greg.\"\n\nThat was right, Greg knew. Paralysis guns wouldn't have been enough out\nthere. Drakeson said softly:\n\n\"Is she worth it, Greg? We may have to be brain-probed. Is she worth\nthat kind of pain?\"\n\n\n\nGreg's stomach seemed to tie up in knots. Brain-probing, psychometry.\nGreg whispered hoarsely. \"She's worth it, Drake. And besides, it's\nridiculous to think that we'll be suspected. I'm only interested in\npreventing Pat from making that suicide trip. The Controllers have the\nsame interest.\"\n\n\"But that's their job. You and I aren't supposed to be concerned with\nreality. They've gotten very sensitive this last year. They can't\ntake any chances. At the least sign of disintegration, they have to\napprehend and send you to psychometry.\"\n\nGreg said. \"You trying to get out of your bargain, Drake? If you don't\nwant that carton of Stage Five dream capsules, then--\"\n\n\"Oh no, I'll take a chance to get that carton. I never thought I'd get\na chance to experience such premature dreams. It's worth the gamble, we\nmight get away without being probed.\"\n\nGreg's head ached. Reality always gave him a headache. He wasn't used\nto it. A man who had reached Stage Five had been an anesthesiac too\nlong to find reality comfortable.\n\n\"I know the Codes,\" Greg whispered. \"Legally, there's no reason to\nbe apprehended just for leaving the Cowl. And as for the blasters,\nwell--we can drop them off, hide them, if the Controllers get after us.\"\n\nThe cruiser moved down the sloping arc of the Cowl toward the dark\npatch that Greg recognized as a merging chamber. The plastic spires\nof the City reached up around them as though reaching for the sun.\nOnly a few human figures could be seen far below, on roofs, and in the\nstreets. A few low stage humans not in anesthesia.\n\nGreg crawled into the shielding suit. He took over the unfamiliar\ncontrols while Drakeson got his own shielding suit on. They weren't\nheavy, but were sluggish material that could throw off ordinary\nradiation.\n\nBehind him Greg heard Drakeson's harsh yell. \"Sky-cars! Ten of them!\nShooting up out of the Control Tower and coming right toward us! Merge,\nand merge fast, Greg, if you still want to go Outside.\"\n\nInside the thick sheeting of the suit, Greg's skin was soaked with\nperspiration. His face was strained as he moved the cruiser into\nthe first lock chamber. The cruiser had to move through a series of\nlocks to the Outside. A precaution to keep bacteria, radiation, other\ninimical elements from coming in while an exit from the Cowl was being\nmade.\n\nOne by one the locks opened and closed as grav-hooks pulled the cruiser\nthrough. It was a precariously balanced culture, this one inside the\nCowls, Greg thought. Like living inside a gigantic sealed test-tube.\nAny slightly alien elements introduced into that test-tube could make\nit a place of sealed death in a short time. A rigidly controlled,\nnon-changing environment. That was fine, except that some humans within\nit had a habit of changing, and for the worse. Retrogression, psychosis.\n\nPsychometry was trying frantically to find the cause. It seemed obvious\nthat the Venusian Colonists might be causing psychotics to appear in\norder to swell their ranks of volunteers to go to Venus to start a \"new\ndynamic, progressive order.\" Madness. Suicide.\n\nProgressive evolutionary philosophies meant change, and change might\nlead anywhere. But eventually it could only lead to another horrible\n_Chain_. One Chain had been enough.\n\nThe earth had been thoroughly wrecked. The few survivors had set\nup the anti-reality standards, the Cowls and the Codes--and the\nControllers. They established the Dream Continuity that led to the\nvarious anesthetic stages.\n\nBut people went insane. They disagreed. They fled the Cowls. Venusian\nColonial Enterprises resulted. It was organized insanity. A neatly\nplanned psychosis, with grandiose delusions of justification. They\nwould save humanity! Madness. Schizophrenia.\n\nVenusian Colonization had been organized three years before. At least\nfour known spaceships had been constructed, stocked, and blasted. They\nchanged their subterranean hideouts after each blast. It had just never\noccurred to Greg that Pat could go psycho and join them.\n\nIt was even more ridiculous for the Controllers to suspect _him_ of\nbeing psycho.\n\nHe felt a little better as the cruiser broke out beyond the Cowl and\ninto the blazing natural sun of noon. It blinded Greg. Frightened him a\nlittle.\n\nHe'd never seen the sun before, except dimmed by the Cowl.\n\nHe sent the cruiser climbing rapidly above the weird grotesque terrain.\nDrakeson jumped into the seat beside him. His face was white.\n\n\"Open the converter feed valves wide, Greg! Clear open! The Control\ncars aren't stopping at the merger. They're coming on through. They're\nright behind us.\"\n\nGreg looked back. Ten sky-cars, and within neuro-gun range. He jerked\nthe converter wide open. Acceleration slammed him back hard. He knew\nnow what fear was. In dreams you never suffered it.\n\n\n\nThe audio in the control panel cracked out.\n\n\"Dalson! Drakeson! Turn around! Re-enter the Cowl. Return immediately.\nThis is a Control Council order. Do so or we fire with full charge\nneuro-blasts.\"\n\nParalysis guns. And full blast. Greg swallowed. They meant business.\nAnd without even a formal enquiry!\n\nDrakeson said in a whisper. \"What are we going to do?\"\n\nGreg didn't know. How could they think he was psycho?\n\nDrakeson licked his lips. \"I don't want to go under the brain-probers,\nGreg. Nobody does. I don't want to be re-conditioned. I want to stay\nlike I am. I'm not psycho. And they'll brain-probe us sure if we don't\nturn around and go back. And even if we do--\"\n\nThe audio's cold impersonal voice said:\n\n\"This is the last order. The neuro-guns are ready to fire.\"\n\nGreg's mind ran in mad circles. He tried to think. He felt Drakeson\nmove, and then he saw Drakeson's hand with that infernal injection\nsolution jiggling around in a big hypodermic syringe.\n\n\"I've just given myself another shot, Greg. You'd better have another\nright now. If we land down there we'll need all the adrenolex we can\nget.\"\n\nGreg hardly felt the injection as he tried to think, clarify his\nsituation. I'm not psycho, he thought desperately. I'm doing something\na little bit different, but it isn't psychosis.\n\nBut good integrated citizens would not fight against the orders from\nControl. All right. He would submit to brain-probing. But he'd get\nPat out of that trap she was in first. He might be able to talk her\nout of it if he could get to her personally, be with her a while. The\nControllers certainly couldn't. They'd drive her away into space as\nsoon as she saw them.\n\nThe solution. A legality. He knew the Codes didn't he?\n\nHe yelled back at the pursuing sky-cars via the audio:\n\n\"Don't fire those neuro-guns. This is Greg Dalson speaking. There's\na law against any aggressive destructive action on the part of any\nCitizen.\"\n\nThe audio replied. \"The neuro-guns aren't destructive. Temporary\nparalysis.\"\n\nGreg said. \"This cruiser is at a high altitude and traveling fast. If\nyou paralyze us now, the cruiser will crash. By using the neuro-guns on\nus, you will be destructive, homicidal.\"\n\nA dead silence greeted this statement. Greg went on. \"I'm a Stage Five\ncitizen. Legally, there's no restriction against going outside the\nCowl. I'll report your action and attitudes to the Council if you fire\nthose neuro-guns.\"\n\nDrakeson choked something unintelligible. His face was deathly pale.\n\"Clever,\" he whispered. \"But that clinches it. When we do go back, it's\npsychometry for us, Greg.\"\n\nFinally the audio answered. The voice was not so cold. It had a tinge\nof emotionalism. It said. \"A technicality, but it does prevent us from\nfiring the neuro-guns. However, we feel it our duty to remain with you\nuntil you do return to the Cowl. Because of the recent epidemic of\npsychosis, we find this authorized by the Control Council....\"\n\nGreg savagely flipped off the audio. Drakeson said. \"If they stay on\nour trail, we'll lead them right to Pat. They'll scare her away before\nyou get a chance to talk with her, and try to prevent her from going on\nthe ship.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Greg said. \"I know. We've got to figure something--\"\n\nHe looked down at the fantastic semi-organic flora below. \"How far to\ngo yet, Drake?\"\n\n\"About three minutes.\"\n\n\"All right. We'll set the cruiser down here, and walk to where Pat is.\"\n\nDrakeson choked. \"That's suicide,\" he said. \"We won't have a chance.\"\n\n\n\nGreg didn't have time to be surprised at his own actions. He pulled\nDrakeson's hands away from the controls. Drakeson was trying to stop\nhim from bringing the cruiser down.\n\nDrakeson gasped. \"Even with the heat-blasters, we'll never get a\nhundred meters away from where we land. I figured on landing directly\nover the place--\"\n\n\"So will the Controllers,\" Greg said. He hurled Drakeson back, heard\nhim sprawl on the mesh flooring where he lay, half sobbing.\n\nGreg angled the ship down abruptly. \"As soon as we land, I'm running\nfor it,\" he called back. \"The Controllers will be down there swarming\nall over us, and I don't want to lead them to where Pat is.\"\n\nDrakeson crawled over to the bunk and sat on it. \"All right,\" he said.\n\"I'm with you. It's too late to get out of it now. For a carton of\npremature dreams, I've gotten myself stuck with a psycho tag. I'm\nstuck with it anyway, now. Might as well go on, and stay out of the\nbrain-probers as long as possible.\"\n\nGreg felt a tingling crawl up his wrists as they dropped down above\nthe gigantic, semi-organic forest. Mutated cells in the process of\nchange had played havoc with the pre-Chain life forms. According to\nwhat little he had gotten from info-tapes, there was no longer any\ndistinction or at least very little, between organic and inorganic\nlife, outside the Cowls.\n\nPsycho. He'd still argue with Drakeson about that, but he didn't have\ntime. He wasn't psycho. As soon as he persuaded Pat to abandon the\nflight, they'd give themselves up, return to the Cowl, and things would\nreturn to normal, to anesthesia, Stage Five, then Six, then Seven, on\nto the final eternal dream.\n\nThat's the way it was going to be.\n\nAnd if they had to suffer the hells of brain-probing and the awful\nego-loss of re-conditioning, then they would do that too. It was\nfor the good of the Cowls, the preservation of the Codes. A noble\nsacrifice. Must be no change. No menace to stability. Any suggestion of\nchange made one suspect.\n\nGreg's eyes misted as he brought the cruiser to a half-crash landing.\nEven as he tried to bring his blurred vision into focus, he was running\nto the exit. He had the sliding panel open. He was up to his knees in\nwrithing tendrils. He was running through a crimson twilight.\n\nBehind him, he heard Drakeson tearing through the tendrils, and\nclutching vines. Overhead he could hear the drone of the sky-car's\natomurbinic motors. Whether they would land and continue the search on\nfoot through the deadly forest, Greg couldn't know.\n\nHe didn't know anything about the Controllers' methods. \"How far,\nDrake,\" he yelled through the inter-person audio. Drakeson came running\nup beside Greg. Severed strings of torn, still living life-stuff\nwrithed from his shoulders and legs.\n\n\"I'd say about half a mile straight ahead. That's a long way through\nthis nightmare.\"\n\nGreg screamed. A broad mushroom-like growth had opened a mouth. A\ngigantic, sickeningly gray mouth full of deadly, flesh-eating acid.\n\nA flower-bright vine with great tensile strength raked Drakeson in\ntoward that gaping maw.\n\nDrakeson's arms were held tight against his sides. He was\nstraining--helpless. Through the glassine mask of his helmet, Greg saw\nDrakeson's face turning red with constriction.\n\nHis voice came to Greg in a burst of fear. \"The gun, Greg! The\nheat-blaster--quick--\"\n\nGreg leaned forward, staring in rigid fascination. Fleshy stocks swayed\ntoward him. Other mouths opened, petal mouths. Gigantic floral traps,\nand cannibal blooms.\n\n\"Greg! Greg!\" Drakeson was framed now by that great cannibal maw.\n\nGreg had the heat-blaster up. He had it leveled. But he couldn't\ndepress the firing stud.\n\n\"Drake! I can't! I can't!\"\n\nHow could any integrated man be deliberately destructive? How could any\nsane person--kill?\n\n\"I can't--Drake--\" The awful conflict seemed to rip through his\nbody. He felt the sweat, hot and profuse, rolling down his face. He\nconcentrated on that gun, on his finger, on the firing stud.\n\nThe cannibal blossom was closing. Sticky juices dripped over Drakeson.\nHe was screaming. Greg's finger lifted. He could not fire.\n\nThe Codes said no destruction. No killing. The Codes had been\nestablished after the great Chain disaster. Violence begets violence,\nthe Codes said. And once begun, it was accumulative, like the snowball\nrolling down hill.\n\nGreg sagged. His knees buckled. He sprawled out in the slippery muck.\nTendrils swished softly and hungrily around him. He heard a shout. He\ntried to twist his head. Figures blurred before his eyes, and he heard\nthe deadly _chehowwwwww_ of a terrific blast.\n\nThe last thing he remembered before the dark wrapped him up softly and\nwarmly, was the cannibal plant exploding in a million fragments of\nstringy tissue, and Drakeson falling free.\n\n_I didn't fire_, he was thinking. _Someone else saved Drakeson. But I\nthink I might have done it. My finger--it was moving--bending--or was\nit? No. I couldn't have been destructive. Couldn't have killed._\n\n\n\nConsciousness came back to Greg. Painfully. It came back slowly and it\ntook a long time. He lifted his eyelids. He raised himself to a sitting\nposition. He stared down a gloomy, phosphorescent corridor. It was\nobviously subterranean. It was damp, chill. Cold luciferin light glowed\nfrom lichen on walls and low ragged ceiling.\n\nIt was long and it finally curved, he decided. But he could look back\ninto a long slow curve of corridor and ahead into the same. Here and\nthere, the mouths of branch corridors came in.\n\nHe looked at his hand. It still clutched the butt of the heat-blaster.\n\nHe felt strange. The surroundings were very real, yet they seemed\nsomehow not real. The shock of trying to fire that blaster when the\nsanity in him shrieked \"No!\" had been too much for him. The shock had\nblanked him out.\n\nHe breathed a deep sigh of temporary relief and triumph. He hadn't\nkilled. He thought of Drakeson. Somebody had saved him. Someone had\nkilled. Not the Controllers. They could employ only the neuro-guns to\nparalyze. So he decided that Colonists had probably saved Drakeson.\n\nTerror gripped Greg then. He remembered Drakeson yelling at him, the\ndistended eyes, the straining face. And how he himself had almost given\nin, had almost killed.\n\n_Had almost gone psycho._\n\nBut he hadn't. That was the important thing. He was still a sane,\nintegrated part of the Cowls and the Codes. And after a test like\nthat, he figured that nothing could break him. Let them send him to\npsychometry. Let them clamp on the brain-probers and leave them on for\nmonths. They'd not find any psycho tendencies in Greg Dalson.\n\nGreg tried to reason. But he had no place, no foundation, for a\nbeginning. He didn't know where he was, or why he had been left here.\nHe knew that someone, the Colonists probably, had saved Drakeson from\nthat plant thing. Some mental pressure had blacked him out, he thought,\nand then what? He didn't know.\n\nWhich way? It didn't seem to matter. He started walking.\n\nHe was bone-weary. His head throbbed. His eyes burned. And he was\nafraid. He had gotten himself into a completely un-Codified situation.\nHe was lost, helpless, outside the protection of the Cowls, the Codes,\nand anesthesia.\n\nHe was surrounded by reality. Reality in all its essential horror.\nConflict. Physical danger. Uncertainties. Materialistic barriers. All\nthe old shibboleths that the Cowls and the Codes and the anesthetic\ndreams had protected him from.\n\nAnd all because of Pat Nichols.\n\nBut he'd stood a big test. And he'd won. He hadn't killed. He wasn't\ndestructive. He--\n\nThe cry touched his ears and died. It was too violent and filled with\npain and terror to make any definite impression the first time. He\ncrouched. His eyes distended. The scream came again, and this time it\nchopped through him. His nerves seemed to shrivel and curl beneath the\nrepeated onslaughts of the screams.\n\nThen he was running. He didn't know why, except that he had to run. He\nran with fearful, gasping desperation. But he didn't know why.\n\n\n\nHe ran past the mouth opening into the main corridor. Then came back\nand ran into the darker, strangely-lighted artery. He ran harder. And\nyet he wasn't running. Not all of him. As he ran, he was conscious of\nsome undefinable, but terrific conflict.\n\nBeneath the suit, his skin burned with sweat. He felt the rigid pattern\nof tensed neck and jaw muscles.\n\n_I don't feel at all familiar. Something's very wrong. Everything's\nwrong. I'm displaced, like something that has slipped into an alien\ndimension._\n\nHe stopped, quickly. His heart seemed to swell, burst with terror.\nTerror and something else. The something else came, and with it came\nhorror of itself. The emotion, and then horror of the emotion. He stood\nshivering, his teeth clacking like an ancient abacus.\n\n\"Pat!\" He screamed her name. The cry pounded back into his ears inside\nthe helmet.\n\nThis wasn't Drakeson. This was Pat. Pat was going to die now. Not\nDrakeson.\n\nThe walls were--_alive_. They were not like the walls of the corridors.\nThis was a circular chamber, and the walls were sagging and undulating\nlike part of a giant's flesh. He heard heavy sluggish sounds.\n\nMasses of the gray viscous stuff sagged, changed form, remolded itself\ninto monstrous shapes.\n\nPat! Only her face and part of her upper body were visible now. The\nshielding of her suit had been cracked wide open by pressure as the\nsemi-organic thing, whatever it was, had closed around her.\n\nThe walls rushed in as Greg stumbled drunkenly. The ceiling sagged\nlower. Long knobs fell, like globules of paste, then lengthened into\nshapeless tendrils that snapped out at Greg.\n\nHe fell back.\n\nPat's scream penetrated again. No beauty remained in her face now. Her\neyes were sick. Her lips were loose and trembling.\n\n\"Greg--help me--help me--see what it does--the others--\"\n\nHe saw the others then. Maybe he hadn't noticed before, because his\nmind didn't want him to see.\n\nHusks. Pallid wrinkled husks, sucked dry and shriveled. Several figures\nnot recognizable anymore, hardly recognizable as human. Just vaguely\nhuman, broken, sucked dry.\n\nHis mind seemed covered by a grotesque shadow. His flesh crawled and\nhis throat turned dry, and perspiration made a stream down his throat.\nHe felt his eyes looking down at his right hand.\n\nIt held the heat-blaster. The skin felt tight as though it would split\nas he gripped the heavy butt of the coiled weapon.\n\nHe concentrated on the finger that was frozen on the firing stud. If he\ncould destroy, then he was insane. His experience with Drakeson, that\nhad been no test at all compared with this. This was Pat. Pat, and she\nwas dying--dying unspeakably.\n\nThis was the great test of his sanity. He concentrated on the finger.\nHe must keep it frozen. He must back out of here. Get away, get back to\nthe Cowl, back to anesthesia and sleep.\n\nThe finger raised slowly from the stud. His feet lifted as his body\nmoved fitfully back, back, back--\n\n\"Greg--help me, Greg--\"\n\nHer eyes stopped him. They tumbled into terrible clarity. She whispered\nstarkly.\n\n\"Greg--help me--kill it, Greg. For me--Kill it.\"\n\nHe felt his lips part in a great and terrible cry of torture. His\nshoulders began to twitch slightly. His arms and fingers took up the\njerky rhythm. Horror and a violent crimson flood of unfamiliar emotions\nmushroomed like a volcano of madness. Something began crumbling away.\n\nHe lurched forward. He felt the heat-blaster heaving, throwing out its\ndeadly load. The gun had weight and power in his hand as he crouched\nlower and moved in.\n\nThe power load swathed in long slicing arcs. Steam and sickening stench\nfell around him. He moved in. He stumbled forward kicking out to right\nand left at the quivering slices of stuff that were falling around him.\n\nDestruction. Kill. Death. This was all three, and in a giant, almost\ninconceivable quantity.\n\nHer face through the steaming cloud. Her throat moving as she\nswallowed. Brightness, the brightness of disbelief and impossibility\ncoming into her eyes.\n\nHe kept moving in until the monstrous mutated gray thing was thoroughly\ndead. Until every separate tendril and patch was blasted to smoke. Then\nhe lifted her broken body in his arms.\n\nTears fell on the opaqueness of his helmet. \"I'm sorry, Pat,\" he\nchoked. \"I'm sorry it didn't happen sooner. I'm sorry I waited too\nlong--but it isn't easy--to let yourself go insane.\"\n\nSomething was wrong. Pat! Pat! She seemed to be fading away from\nhim, drifting away, melting into tattered veils of cloud. Her face\nbecame only two bright glad eyes, then they also melted together into\na radiant pool. He toppled into the pool. He sank down, a wonderful\nlifelessness spreading through him.\n\nHe closed his eyes. Something was beginning to be very funny. In the\nthickening dark, he laughed a little. And in that laugh was a crazy,\nclimbing note of--triumph.\n\n\n\nHe opened his eyes. He was laughing, in a kind of soft hysteria. He was\non a couch. Not a dream couch, but just a plain hard bed. He sat up\nstiffly. Pain tingled down his legs. He saw Pat Nichols. And another. A\nman. He remembered him vaguely, one of the first who had escaped from\nthe Cowl. His name--yes--he remembered now. Merrol.\n\nPat Nichols, alive, and smiling. Very beautiful too in a brief aerosilk\nbra and shorts and sandals. Her hair was a dark lovely cloud flowing\ndown over bare shoulders.\n\n\"Hello, Greg,\" she said softly. \"Welcome to--the Colonists.\"\n\n\"What?\" He swung his legs around. \"I don't understand. Not entirely.\"\n\nMerrol, a gaunt elderly man, nodded from behind a desk. Merrol's hair\nwas gray and sparse. Strange, seeing a man who showed age. Within the\nCowls, one never grew physically old.\n\nPat said, \"This is Ralph Merrol, Personnel Director of Venusian\nColonization Enterprises.\"\n\nGreg's numbness was filtering away beneath Pat's warm glad eyes. He\nraised his hand. The heat-blaster was still gripped in his fingers. It\nevidently hadn't been fired.\n\n\"It was all illusion,\" he said. \"The scene in the cavern. It never\nhappened?\"\n\nMerrol's care-lined face nodded. \"It happened, but in your mind, Greg.\nWe rescued you and Drakeson from the cannibal plant. We brought you\nhere. You had lost consciousness. We put you under the hypnosene rays,\nand put you through an experience that was quite real to you. We proved\nsomething to ourselves, and to you. Greg--you're sane now.\"\n\nGreg tried to understand. The thing didn't make sense yet, but the\nglimmerings of the truth were beginning to solidify in his aching brain.\n\n\"Sane? But I killed. I wanted to kill. I wanted to destroy, and I did.\nThat's hardly the actions of a--sane man.\"\n\nMerrol smiled thinly. \"From our point of view it is, Greg. We consider\nourselves sane. We consider the Cowled Cities, and the Codes insane.\nIt's relative I supposed, but I think we can convince you, if we\nhaven't already.\"\n\nGreg looked at Pat. She smiled. He smiled back. \"Justified or not,\"\nhe whispered. \"I'm here. Sane or insane, I'm one of the Colonists\nnow I guess. Unless I want to return to the Cowls, be probed and\nre-conditioned.\"\n\nPat whispered. \"Do you, Greg?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"Not now. I'm tired. I don't want to now. Maybe I\nnever will. All I want now, is rest.\"\n\nMerrol leaned across the desk. \"Before you rest, you'd better get a\nfew things straight, Greg. We want you to be convinced that you're\ndoing the right thing. We feel that the big Chain blow-up shocked\nthe whole human race into a mass psychosis, comparable to individual\ncases of hysteria, schizophrenia, escape from reality. That's why\nthe non-change, non-aggressiveness Codes were established. Also, the\nanesthesia, the Dream Continuity Scale--nothing but hysteria on a mass\nand planned basis.\"\n\nMerrol got up. He walked around and sat down beside Greg.\n\n\"Carried out to its inevitable end, this could only lead to mass\nracial suicide. That's obvious. It was a static dead end. A few people\nrecovered from the psychosis. They escaped, and formed the Colonists.\nBut their own welfare wasn't the most important thing.\n\n\"They concerned themselves then with the freeing of the Citizens of\nthe Cowls from their psychosis. The world is untenable on a large\nscale now, due to radioactive poisoning. It will remain untenable for\nsome time. Meanwhile we decided to Colonize Venus. We've established\nColonies there. Thriving communities, but the important thing is this,\nGreg--it's given new impetus and enthusiasm to those who become sane\nand escape the Cowls. It presents a big challenge and solidifies the\ncure.\n\n\"It's bigger than Control has any idea that it is. It will take a long\ntime yet, but we'll win. You have noticed the increase in so-called\ninsanity in the Cowls. It really means just the opposite. Our numbers\nare increasing by leaps and bounds.\"\n\nGreg said, \"The Controllers think you're using some psychological or\nphysical pressure to create these--cures.\"\n\nMerrol smiled. \"We've got a recruiting system. Drakeson, for example,\nis a spy. We have spies all over the Cowls.\"\n\nGreg stared. \"Drakeson?\"\n\nA door opened. The lean cynical man entered, nodded, and stood beside\nPat. His eyes shone more brightly as he looked at Greg.\n\n\"That's right,\" Drakeson said. \"Remember the two injections. I said\nthey were adrenolex. They weren't. Our spies inside the Cowls are\nequipped with a supply of a certain aggression factor. It used to be\ncalled Kappa, or K, for killer. This factor is handed down through\nthe generations in the general cell protoplasm. It forces aggressive\ntendencies. It makes a man capable of physical aggressive action, and\nable to kill, if he has to. High motivation is required though, in most\ncases. With you, my probable death wasn't enough. It took the vision of\nPat here in the clutches of a monster to make the Kappa factor work on\nyou, Greg.\"\n\nGreg rubbed his eyes. Pat came over and he took her hand, held it\ntightly. A warmth came out of her and into him, into his mind.\n\n\n\nDrakeson went on. \"We isolated the Kappa factor, made it into solution.\nWe all have it, even the anesthetic citizens of the Cowls, but the mass\nshock psychosis won't let it work. However, a strong overload of Kappa\ninjection will sometimes break the psychosis, force the person back\ninto an aggressive personality, capable of destruction. Each individual\ncarries an armament of between 200 and 800 particles of the Kappa\nfactor after we give an injection. It took 1600 particles to break your\nsuicidal hysteria.\"\n\nPat squeezed his hand. Greg looked up. He grinned with a kind of glad\nembarrassment.\n\n\"I don't know yet whether to thank you or not. Frankly though, I do\nfeel better.\"\n\nHe thought of the Cowls. Test-tubes, glass cages, and dreams that led\nfinally to the final anesthesia, death. He shuddered, and tried to push\nthe memory out of his mind. It seemed unhealthy now. Unclean and--yes,\nit did seem insane.\n\nHe raised his eyes to the ceiling. He saw the self-inverting three\ndimensional mechanism that had given him that starkly real adventure\nin which he had been able to kill, for Pat. A dream sequence, partly\nhypnotic, partly created by cathode image activating the multi-phase\nAC. A high harmonic of multi-phase AC field hanging over him, and a\nfocusing radiator. Dream. Nightmare.\n\nHe looked at Pat. \"I think I'll take reality now,\" he said softly. He\nfelt the pull on his arm, and he got up. She led him through a door and\ninto a soft twilight. He held her tightly against him.\n\nShe whispered. \"The ship's waiting for us, Greg. The next ship. You're\nalready on the passenger list. You see, I knew you'd come with us. I\nwas hoping so desperately, I couldn't think any differently.\"\n\nHe kissed her. He held her more tightly as though--as though--\n\nHe felt her warm muscles tense against him. Her eyes widened.\n\n\"Greg! What is it?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"I--I got to wondering if this too, might not be\njust a dream. I've been in anesthesia too long maybe. How can I know\nwhat's real and what isn't real?\"\n\nHe felt her warm moist fingers on the back of his neck. He felt her\nlift on her toes, pull his face down. She kissed him. Her voice was\nhusky, and her breath was warm on his lips.\n\n\"Do you know now, Greg? Is this a dream?\"\n\nHe shook his head. His voice was hoarse.\n\n\"No--no--this isn't a dream.\"\n\nShe laughed softly. They moved away, down the corridor toward the ship.",
