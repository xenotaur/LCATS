    "body": "Bill Bradley shooed away the group of Quxas that had surged over\nthe first-base line. With broad grins on their flat, piebald faces,\nthey moved away--in the wrong direction, of course--and squatted\nin a smiling semicircle around Pat Reed, who was playing third.\nThis was bad, because Reed was a fifty-fifty player: It was an even\nchance whether he got the ball or the ball got him. One of the\nhalf-domesticated thrags broke loose and cantered across the outfield\nwith its peculiar five-legged gait. In the hubbub, Ray Bush stole\nsecond. Nobody seemed to notice.\n\nSighing heavily, Bill returned to the mound and whiplashed in a fast\none, tight across the letters. The hitter got only a small piece of it;\na pop fly sauntered toward left field. Judging it to a nicety, Gust\nMustas came racing in, evaded a tethered thrag, leaped a hole some Quxa\nhad dug and forgotten, and made a shoestring catch, retiring the side.\nThe Quxas cheered deliriously.\n\nBill trotted off the mound. For a moment, the thrill of the game held\nhim. This was the way things should be: The feel of smoothly flowing\nmuscles, the thudding sound of horsehide hitting a leather glove, the\nweight of a bat in your hands in your first ball game after clambering\nover and scrabbling in an unexplored planet for fourteen months.\n\nThen he caught sight of Candace Mathews, walking among the pneuma-huts\nthat served as the outpost camp for the expedition. Gloom enveloped him\nagain, surrounding him like a dank fog.\n\n\n\nFor fourteen long months, Bill had feasted on the memory of Candy\nMathews, on his recollection of her turquoise eyes and cascading brown\nhair, on the remembrance of her soft lips on his last night under the\nfour moons of Vensor III.\n\nToday she had arrived with the seventy-odd men and women who comprised\nthe appraisal unit, the final group of the planet's explorers. He had\nlooked forward like a schoolboy to her coming. And, like a schoolboy,\nhe had suffered black despair when his dreams were shattered.\n\nFor the Candy Mathews who got off the shuttlebug at Camp Outpost was\nnot the Candy Mathews who had said soft words on Vensor III. She was,\ninstead, a self-assured young woman, somehow harder, who felt only an\nindifferent tolerance toward a tall young man named Bill Bradley, and\nan all-consuming, hero-worshipping infatuation for a newcomer, a dapper\nwalking brain, Vance Montgomery, one of the council's smart boys, with\nthe title of planet evaluator.\n\n\"He's simply wonderful,\" she had said. And the joy of life had gone out\nof Bill Bradley.\n\nThe appraisal group brought in athletic equipment and Bill's men\nspontaneously declared a holiday, their first on the planet. Baseball\nwas the order of the afternoon and they shanghaied a not unwilling Bill\nto pitch. He should, he knew, be laying out reports for Montgomery to\nstudy. He did not particularly want to be with Montgomery.\n\nBill sat on the xetal log that served as a bench.\n\nOne Quxa was bent over, examining first base. He made a colorful sight.\nThe first baseman slapped him jovially on the loin cloth to move him.\n\nThe owner of the thrag caught up to it and was struggling manfully\nto lead it away. The five-legged beast defied his efforts, rearing\nand dragging him. A dozen Quxas stood nearby. Their sympathies were\nobviously with their fellow-Quxa, but they made no move to help him.\n\nReed was on the bench next to Bill. He had come in with the appraisal\ngroup.\n\n\"Your vivid friends,\" he said, cocking a thumb at the Quxas, \"don't\nappear too bright.\"\n\n\"They're smart enough,\" said Bill. \"Almost as intelligent as we are.\nIt's just that they've never risen above a herd culture.\"\n\n\"Look,\" said Reed. \"I'm a silviculturist. Give me a hunk of wood and I\ncan tell how long it took to grow, what it's good for, where it can be\nraised and how much board and profit can be made out of it. But this\nkind of talk throws me. Try another wave-length.\"\n\n\"Socially, they're like the seals or penguins back on Earth. They like\nto gather in groups. The things they can do individually, they do\nwell. But they don't know how to help each other. That's beyond them.\"\n\n\"Don't understand the meaning of cooperation?\"\n\n\"The word isn't even in their language. I've seen forty of them\nstanding around, fretting and stewing, while the horals killed off one\nof their fellows.\"\n\n\"What are horals?\"\n\n\"The other dominant life-form here. Nasty brutes, like big upright ants\nwith tentacles. Stand about as high as my chest. Most malignant things\nI've seen. One Quxa can handle any horal, maybe even two or three. But\nthe horals hunt in packs. Good-by Quxa.\"\n\n\"Killing them off, are they?\"\n\n\"This is the last big concentration the Quxas have left. In another\nhundred years, there'll be no more Quxas.\"\n\n\n\nThey looked again at the natives. The Quxas were something to\nsee--human in form, although somewhat shorter than Earthmen; their\nskins were blotched and dashed with patches of vivid colors.\nAntiquarians talked of their resemblance to the ancient circus clowns,\na likeness furthered by their broad, flat faces and habitual grins.\n\n\"Sort of hate to see them disappear,\" Bill said glumly. \"They're happy,\ngood-natured creatures. In their whole race, I know only one who's\nmean. We've done our best to help them. But if they won't cooperate\neven in a matter of life and death, what incentive can you offer them?\"\n\nAn elbow dug into him.\n\n\"Up to the platter, dream boy,\" said Gust Mustas. \"A hit means two\nruns.\"\n\nSelecting a bat, Bill made his way to the plate. In the middle\ndistance, Vance Montgomery emerged from a hut. Candy went to him\neagerly, put a hand on his arm. A deep rage engulfed Bill.\n\nThe first pitch was a curve that failed to break. As it came fatly over\nthe plate, Bill swung angrily. The ball rocketed up and away, past the\ninfield, over the head of the desperately running left-fielder and\ndropped toward a sure home run.\n\nThen a curious thing happened. One of the Quxas darted away from the\ngabbling group along the foul line, his short legs churning over the\nuneven ground. As the ball sank, he dove, plucked it out of the air\nwith one broad hand, turned a somersault and came up with it, grinning.\nIt was an impossible catch and the Earthmen joined the Quxas in\napplause. Still clinging to the ball, the Quxa made little bobbing bows\nof acknowledgment.\n\n\"Throw it in!\" shouted Bill. The Quxa stood motionless. \"Throw it in,\nAdlaa!\" Bill urged. He went through a throwing motion.\n\nThe Quxa nodded comprehension. He went into a violent wind-up. His left\nfoot came up, his upper body went back, his right arm snapped in an\narc. The ball flew from his hand, straight and fast.\n\nIn the wrong direction, of course.\n\nThe pack of Quxas pelted after it, shouting, picked it up and threw\nagain. To his surprise, Bill found himself pounding after them, bawling\nfruitless pleas, aware that he looked foolish, but, in his rage, not\ncaring. He closed in on them on the fifth throw and his fingertips\ntouched the ball. He succeeded only in deflecting it. There was a dull\n_thunk_ and the game was over. The ball had struck Vance Montgomery,\nplanet evaluator, squarely in the left eye.\n\nThree things were said then to Bill Bradley.\n\nOne was by Montgomery as he handed back the ball. \"I was not aware,\nBradley, that the job of camp leader entailed joining the rowdyism of\nthe native races.\"\n\nOne was by Candy Mathews, hopping with anger. \"You're a barbarian, Bill\nBradley. Monty might have been badly hurt.\"\n\nThe third was by a clot of Quxas, crowding eagerly. \"Play ball!\nBillbrad, more play ball!\"\n\nTo the first two, Bill did not reply. To the Quxas, he said one word,\n\"Nuts!\" and dolefully followed Montgomery into the headquarters hut.\n\n\n\nIn spite of his natural prejudice against Montgomery, Bill was forced\ninto a reluctant admiration for the way the man worked.\n\nMontgomery's task was to recommend whether the planet should be marked\nfor immediate colonization, placed on a reserve list for future\nexpansion, or be left strictly alone as unworthy of occupancy. He tore\nthrough Bill's reports like a small child through a bag of jellybeans.\nHis questions, if pompous, were pointed.\n\nWithin twenty-four hours, ready to leave for the main camp, he called a\nconference.\n\nHe stood before the group, as dapper as a man can be with a rainbow\nbruise under one eye, complacently listening to the resonance of his\nown voice. Beside him, Candy nodded worshipful agreement. Bill grumped\nin a corner.\n\nFor a full forty-five minutes, Montgomery outlined additional data he\nwanted gathered. His voice was faintly chiding, implying by its tone\nthat anybody but a dolt would have obtained the information long ago.\n\n\"And now,\" he said, \"we come to the question of the humanoid denizens\nof this planet--the so-called Quxas.\" He fingered his black eye. \"Many\npersons might conclude that the Quxas are not worth saving; and in\nthemselves, they are not. However, my preliminary conclusions--based,\nunfortunately, on insufficient data--lead me to believe that this\nplanet will be used for colonization in about five hundred years. It\nwould be very convenient then to have a dominant life-form friendly to\nthe galactic humans and capable of being integrated with the colonists.\nSome method of preserving the Quxas must therefore be worked out. In\nthis, the advance group has failed lamentably.\"\n\nHe paused, glanced around triumphantly.\n\n\"How do I propose to achieve this? By a historical method. What do\nnations do when they are in peril? They call upon a single man, place\nthemselves under him and let him lead them out. When the ancient\nwestern civilization was in its greatest danger after the fall of Rome,\nthe people gathered around the strong men, made them kings and dukes\nand earls, and were saved from barbarism.\n\n\"I shall do the same for the Quxas. The Quxas shall have a king.\"\n\nHis eyes sought out Bill.\n\n\"My acquaintance here has been short. I must rely on advice. Bradley,\nwhom would you recommend as king of the Quxas?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Bill slowly, \"Moahlo is the most intelligent. He's\ngood-natured and kindly. He has a lot of artistic ability. Some of his\ncarvings are being taken back for the Galactic Folk Museum.\"\n\n\"An artist!\" said Montgomery in disgust. \"Well, let's have a look at\nhim.\"\n\n\n\nMoahlo was finishing a figurine near one of the meandering paths that\nthe Quxas had worn by habit, not design. A bemused group of natives\nlooked on admiringly.\n\nDown the path came Ratakka, the biggest of the Quxas, his shoulders\nproudly back, his face set in the truculent scowl. Bill knew and\ndisliked him, and apprehensively felt sure the peaceful scene would be\ndestroyed. Alone of an amiable, tolerant race, Ratakka was perpetually\nill-tempered, the rankling product of Lord knew what alien genetic\naccident or trauma.\n\nRatakka found his path obstructed by the carving. Callously, he brought\nhis foot down on the delicate figurine, crushing it to splinters.\nMoahlo sprang up in gentle protest. Ratakka gave him the back of a\nmeaty hand that knocked him off his feet. Two spectators indicated\ndisapproval. Ratakka smashed their heads together and strode on.\n\n\"To save a culture, Bradley,\" said Montgomery, who had watched the\nbrutal display with admiration, \"you need strength, not delicacy or\nfeeling. That man shall be king of the Quxas.\"\n\nHe ran after Ratakka.\n\nThe members of the outpost staff looked at Bill in dismay. He shrugged\nsadly and walked out of the headquarters hut. At the doorway, Adlaa was\nwaiting for him with the same old plea.\n\n\"Play ball?\" he begged. \"More play ball, Billbrad?\"\n\nIn his despondent mood, Bill did not care.\n\n\"All right. I'll throw the ball to you and you throw it back to me.\"\n\n\"Quxas not do that.\"\n\n\"It's just as much fun to throw the ball in one direction as in any\nother direction,\" Bill explained patiently. \"Unless you throw it back,\nforget it--no play ball.\"\n\nAdlaa thought seriously. \"Hunky dokey. Want play ball.\"\n\nThey were tossing it back and forth in the middle of a cheering group\nwhen a half-track passed, taking Montgomery, Candy and Ratakka to the\nmain camp. The look that the girl gave Bill was disdainful.\n\n\"There's a gaggle of natives outside in assorted shades,\" said Pat\nReed the next day. \"They want to play ball. Moahlo's at their head. He\ncarved a bat.\"\n\n\"Tell them to beat it. We're busy.\"\n\n\"Let's give them some fun while we can. They won't enjoy life much\nafter King Rat gets back here.\"\n\n\"That's the truth,\" Bill agreed. \"All right.\"\n\n\n\n\"I wish your painted idiots would get over their baseball mania,\"\ncomplained Rudy Peters, the mineralogist, two days later. \"Look me over\ncarefully, will you, Bill? I think my throwing arm just dropped off.\"\n\n\"They're nutty about it, all right,\" Bill Bradley said. \"Too bad it\ncouldn't have been about something with some economic value.\"\n\n\"Economic value, the man wants. Okay, I'll talk economic value to you.\nBet you fifty units I can make a better ball team out of these freaks\nthan you can.\"\n\n\"Well, make it thirty.\"\n\n\"You're on, sucker. I've lined up the sweetest shortstop that ever spit\nin a glove ...\"\n\n\"Here's your thirty,\" said Rudy Peters a week after. \"How was I to\nknow that shortstop wouldn't throw the ball to anyone except the\ncenter-fielder?\"\n\n\"Team play's the stuff, lad,\" said Bill Bradley. \"Stress team play.\nTwenty-five, twenty-seven, twenty-nine, thirty. Exactly right. Another\nlesson at the same price?\"\n\nHe was refused, but never on an exploration had Bill Bradley had so\nmuch fun. And never, he reminded himself grimly, had he got so little\nwork done. The Quxas were neglecting their skimpy food plots in their\neagerness to play. They were getting lean. Finally, with reluctance,\nBill called a temporary halt to baseball.\n\n\"Billbrad say no baseball until work done,\" said Moahlo sadly to Adlaa.\n\"Sometimes Billbrad talk like southpaw pitcher.\"\n\nAdlaa was trying to cultivate his food plot with the help of a thrag.\nThe beast was of independent mind. It dragged Adlaa in eccentric ovals,\nin defiance of agricultural needs.\n\n\"Adlaa want finish work, play baseball,\" the Quxa commented. \"Thrag no\nplay baseball, say nuts to work. Adlaa be old like Old Hoss Radbourne\nbefore work done.\"\n\nMoahlo contemplated. \"Adlaa have trouble his thrag. Moahlo have trouble\nhis. Moahlo help Adlaa his thrag and Adlaa help Moahlo his. Get work\ndone more faster.\"\n\nAdlaa dismissed the revolutionary thought. \"Quxas not do.\"\n\n\"We play baseball run down play,\" argued Moahlo. \"Play together. You\nthrow ball me. I throw ball you. Yippee. Man out.\"\n\n\"Same team. Old pals. Want sing team song?\"\n\n\"Want play team with thrag.\"\n\nAdlaa considered the matter in this new light. \"Like ball game,\" he\nsaid at last in amazement.\n\n\"Sure. You, me be us together. Make thrag look like busher.\"\n\nThey both took hold of the thrag. Unable to resist their combined\nstrengths, the beast submitted docilely. They began to work.\n\n\n\nGlancing out from his labor in the headquarters pneuma-hut, Bill saw\nthe incident in happy surprise. Perhaps, after all, his stay here might\nproduce something to help the culture that Montgomery would introduce\nupon his return. He had no doubt of Montgomery's success.\n\nNeither, for that matter, had Montgomery. At the main camp, things were\ngoing swimmingly.\n\nThe camp lay on the very fringe of the Quxa territory, but, by an\narduous hunt, Ratakka had captured eight wandering Quxas to whom he\nimmediately set about teaching the duties of subjects. His method\nwas simple--the Quxa followed his orders, which he obtained from\nMontgomery, or the Quxa was knocked down. If he still refused, he was\nknocked down again. Within three weeks, Ratakka had them doing things\nno Quxas ever had done before. They performed them reluctantly and\nsullenly, but they did them.\n\nSeeing the result, but not the means, Candy was enthusiastic.\n\n\"They're working together!\" she cried. \"Oh, Monty, what will the Quxas\ndo to reward you?\"\n\n\"Oh, they'll probably make a culture god of me,\" said Montgomery,\nmanaging to look modest. \"Like the Greeks did to that Martian, Proma Ss\nThaa, who taught them the use of fire.\"\n\nAs time went on, though, the girl began to have doubts.\n\n\"But they're doing everything for Ratakka,\" she protested. \"As far as\nthey're concerned themselves, they're more wretched than before.\"\n\n\"That's the way feudal cultures are built, my dear,\" Montgomery assured\nher. \"The king gives them law and a fighting leader. In return, the\nsubjects take care of his bodily comfort.\"\n\n\"But they look so unhappy!\"\n\n\"In saving an inferior race, we cannot be concerned too much about the\nhappiness of a few miserable members. Perhaps in three hundred years or\nso, they can afford happiness.\"\n\nAnd finally an incident happened to complete her disillusionment.\n\nOne of Ratakka's morose subjects managed to slip the shackles with\nwhich he was bound at night and make a bolt for freedom. The king\npursued him relentlessly, brought him back and then beat him, coldly\nand cruelly, slugging and gouging and kicking.\n\nAshen-faced, Candy moved to interfere; Montgomery restrained her.\n\n\"We're saving a race,\" he said. \"You can't make an omelet without\nbreaking a few eggs.\"\n\nCandy turned and ran sobbing to her quarters, unable to dispel the\nmemory of the writhing body on the ground.\n\n\n\nThe next day was the day to move equipment. It was a policy of the\nexpeditions to leave their wornout machines for the most friendly of\nthe native races, who could dismantle them and use the parts. The\nequipment not worth toting back to Earth was to be taken to the advance\ncamp, where the Quxa center was. Montgomery also planned that day to\ntake Ratakka to his kingdom.\n\nA few minutes ahead of the motorcade, Candy slipped out, got into\na battered half-track and started driving the eighty miles to the\nadvance camp. For the first twenty-five miles, she told herself that\nher eagerness was because it was a nice day and she wanted to get out\nof camp.\n\nFor the next twenty-five miles, she called herself a liar.\n\nFor the third twenty-five miles she gave herself up unashamedly to\nthinking about Bill Bradley: his smile, his gentleness, the awkward\ngrace of his lean body. Not a man to set a planet on fire--but how\npleasant and restful to have around!\n\nShe wondered if he would forgive the way she had acted. Somehow she was\nsure he would.\n\nThe narrow vehicular trail ran through a grove of fernlike trees. It's\njust over the rise, Candy thought, just over the rise and down into the\nsaucer, where Bill is waiting....\n\nThe half-track struck a rock, lurched, threw a tread and went off the\nroad, out of control.\n\nThat did not matter especially, for the Quxas could use the material\nvery well where it was. Candy went forward briskly afoot. A fallen\nbranch brushed her ankle. Unheedingly, she kicked it away. She began\nto reconstruct Bill, feature by feature: the way his hair swirled\non his forehead; his eyebrows, arched and regular; his eyes, wide,\ndeep-seated, with inner pools of merriment; his nose, straight and\nrather ...\n\nAnother branch caught her. She lifted her foot to free it. It did not\ncome free. Another tentacle moved around her, pinioning her right arm\nto her side. She whirled in terror and found herself in the grip of the\nhorals.\n\n\n\nThere were a dozen of the horrors, their antenna ears erect, mandibles\nopen. They exuded an acid odor, a sign of hunger. Candy screamed. She\nfought to reach her pistol, strapped to her right hip. More tentacles\nstopped her. She screamed and screamed again, throwing her body to\nshake off the grip, trying to kick with her feet.\n\nThere was a movement in the road at the top of the rise. For a moment,\nelation surged in Candy, almost stifling her. Perhaps some expedition\nmember had heard her, was hurrying to her rescue. Then she saw that\nthe newcomers were Quxas. Hope vanished, leaving her limp and hollow.\nTo be killed by these horrors was bad enough, but to be killed in the\npresence of a group of piebald morons, who would stand and watch and\nmoan, but not lift a hand ...\n\nIn her agitation, she did not notice that the Quxas were nine in number\nand wore baseball caps. They drew short clubs, shaped like bats.\n\n\"Kill the umpire!\" they shouted, hatred born of diamond conflicts in\ntheir cry. \"Kill the umpire!\" they yelled and charged.\n\n\n\nIn military formation, they clubbed their way through their enemies,\nbattering and smashing until Candy was free, with a dozen dying horals\non the ground, their tentacles contracting and writhing. The Quxa\nleader made his bobbing bow to her.\n\n\"How do,\" he said politely. \"We dip them in calcimine vat, you bet. We\nhang them out like wash. Now we give team yell.\"\n\nThe Quxas put their arms around each other's shoulders. In unison, they\nchanted:\n\n    \"Hoe tomata; hoe potata\n    Half past alligata,\n    Bum, bum, bulligata,\n    Chickala dah!\n    Pussycats! Pussycats!\n    Rah! Rah! Rah!\"\n\n\"Pussycats,\" the leader explained to Candy, \"are honored animal on\nplanet where Billbrad is head cheese.\"\n\n\"I'll bet you play baseball nicely,\" Candy said.\n\nWoe broke forth on nine broad faces.\n\n\"Misfortunately not,\" confessed the captain. \"Thirty-three teams in\nQuxa town. Pussycats in thirty-third place.\" He brightened. \"Go ivory\nhunt now. Catch nine new Quxas. Teach 'em baseball. Then maybe we beat\n'em and not be in cellar any more.\"\n\nTogether, the team bobbed politely to Candy and trotted down the road.\n\nHappily, Candy went up the rise, then stopped in astonishment, looking\nat Quxa town.\n\nGone was the straggling, haphazard settlement, with the flimsy huts\nand untended starvation patches where individual Quxas tried to raise\ntheir own food. Instead, building sites were laid out in straight,\nbroad rows, and Quxas were working, three and four in a group, raising\nsubstantial homes of timber. Others were surrounding the settlement\nwith a wall of brambles, impenetrable to horals. Teams of men, two to a\nthrag, were plowing, preparing large fields for tillage. And down the\nside of the settlement, affectionately tended, ran a line of baseball\nfields.\n\nJust off the road, a Quxa squatted, baseball cap on his head, watching\na crude sun dial.\n\n\"Nice day for game,\" he greeted Candy.\n\n\n\nSpeechless with surprise, the girl made a dazed questioning gesture\ntoward the improvements.\n\n\"Billbrad do it,\" the Quxa informed her. \"He tell us how. Work one\nby one, he say, work all time to fill belly, maybe fill horal belly\ninstead. Work all by all, do more quick. Have time in afternoon. Batter\nup! Sock it, boy! Wing it home, he sliding!\"\n\nThe sun's shadow touched a peg.\n\n\"Five minute!\" bawled the Quxa.\n\nThe laborers quit work, put away their tools. The farmers herded their\nthrags into a strongly constructed corral. The natives gathered in\nknots at the settlement edge and looked longingly at the baseball\nfields.\n\n\"Yestday I fool Billbrad,\" confided the Quxa. \"I hide ball, catch him\noff second. Billbrad get all red face and say--\"\n\n\"Never mind what Bill said,\" Candy interjected hastily.\n\nThe shadow touched another peg.\n\n\"Play ball!\" the Quxa yelled. \"Play ball! Play ball! Play ball!\"\n\nHe sprang up, produced a baseball glove and spat into it reverently.\n\n\"I go play now. You come see. Get scorecard, know players.\"\n\nHe looked at Candy hopefully.\n\n\"'Specially me,\" he added.\n\nOut of the moil of Quxas came the lank form of Bill Bradley. He spied\nthe girl, whooped and came running to her. For a few moments they\ntalked at once, in an incoherent and ecstatic jumble. Then Candy,\ncatching control of herself, cited in admiration the change in the Quxa\nvillage.\n\n\"And you've done all this!\" she concluded.\n\n\"I didn't do anything!\" Bill protested. \"They like to play baseball\nand this sort of happened. We're getting representative government\ninto action now. Each team elects a captain and the captains are the\ntown council. Tonight they're going to vote on naming the settlement\nBrooklyn.\"\n\n\"You know,\" said Candy, \"I'll bet they'll make you a culture god.\"\n\n\n\nThe tanned face of Bill Bradley took on the rose hue of a blush.\n\n\"Well, Moahlo carved a statue and they've put it in front of league\nheadquarters--that's their city hall,\" he admitted uncomfortably. \"It\ndoesn't look much like me. I've got six arms because they wanted me\nbatting, pitching and catching a ball all at the same time.\"\n\nCandy slipped a hand into his.\n\n\"Is there a place around here,\" she asked in a small tone, \"where a\nculture god can take a girl and--well, talk to her?\"\n\n\"Is there!\" said Bill. \"You just come with me ...\"\n\nA heavy object bumped into him. He whirled at the touch.\n\n\"Oh! Hi, Ratakka,\" Bill said in a flat voice.\n\nMontgomery's king had returned to his subjects. He was alone--his\ncaptives having escaped off the ride over--and he was in vile temper.\nGlaring evilly, he motioned at the baseball players. He was recalling\nan advice of Montgomery: \"Whatever your subjects like to do most, do it\nbetter than they can. In that way, you will get their respect and find\nit easier to take over.\"\n\n\"What that fool doings-on?\" snarled Ratakka. \"Ratakka do, too.\"\n\nBill's already sagging spirits sank again. With Ratakka's strength and\nreflexes, the great brute undoubtedly would become the star of stars,\ngathering admirers to himself and destroying all the pleasant prospects\nnow so happily started. Still, it was Bill's duty to give him every\nchance ...\n\n\"I'll see what team has an opening, Ratakka. Perhaps you'd better bat\nseventh for a few days. Then you can move to the clean-up spot.\"\n\nThe giant stopped him. \"Ratakka not ordinary Quxa; Ratakka a king.\nRatakka not play like those serfs. Want special job.\"\n\nA wild thought struck Bill. On the playing fields were more than two\nhundred Quxas, most of them with a justified and carefully nurtured\ndislike for the surly slab of muscle before him. In the old days, they\ncould do nothing individually against him.\n\nBut the Quxas had learned to fight as a team. If he could only give\nthem the shadow of an excuse, trap Ratakka into rousing their joint\nanger, take advantage of the prejudices of their new-found love for\nbaseball, then Ratakka would get the reckoning that he deserved, the\ndays of his supremacy would be over, the threat of his tyranny would be\nremoved from a happy race.\n\n\n\nBill grinned broadly. \"Sure thing, old pal,\" he said.\n\nHe took off his own baseball cap and put it backward on Ratakka's head.\nHe signaled for someone to bring over a mask and chest protector.\n\n\"There's only one of these at each playing field,\" Bill explained. \"In\na way, he's boss of the game. Are you sure you want to do it? Sometimes\nthe players argue with you.\"\n\n\"Anyone argue with Ratakka,\" the giant said, raising a huge fist,\n\"Ratakka knock 'em down. Ratakka a king, boss of game.\"\n\n\"Okay, boy, you asked for it,\" Bill said.\n\nHe thrust a whiskbroom into Ratakka's hand.\n\n\"You can be umpire,\" said Bill Bradley.",
