    "body": "Far off in the steaming Venusian jungle, a band of the Chameleon men\nhalted, lifting their mottled faces in the direction of the sound.\nCloser in, a four-man jungle patrol of Earthmen broke as one man into a\nrun along the trail, their swift-moving bodies swishing the clouds into\nragged streamers.\n\nAt the edge of the viscous river circling the island an armed guard\nslipped on his infra-red glasses and began searching his area\ncarefully, his special light traveling slowly along the river and its\nnear and opposite banks.\n\nOn the island, only a few yards from the high, thick walls of the\nInterplanetary Prison, a patch of ground, approximately eight feet by\nfive quivered once--and was still.\n\nThe deep-throated roar of the escape siren was thunderous. It carried\nfor scores of miles through the steamy atmosphere of the planet,\nalerting both natives and Earthman patrols to a successful break from\nthat most fabulous of prisons--The Hole.\n\nBehind the oxygen mask he wore, lying under a foot of the thick spongy\nsoil of the planet, Jarl Gare wiggled his itching body and chuckled.\n\nHe nudged Waltk, the huge Jovian who lay beside him. \"Don't get\nrestless, now,\" he mumbled through the mask. \"We have hours to wait.\nAnd somebody might spot this patch of ground if you keep wriggling.\"\n\nThe Jovian grunted, wriggled again, and then was quiet.\n\n\"Men have escaped from The Hole before,\" Jarl Gare muttered, \"but they\nwere always caught before they got to the pearl-beds. Waltk's body and\nmy brain will get us through.\"\n\nHe envisioned one of the huge Venusian pearls--so rare and so precious\non Earth that it could buy a man's freedom, even from a murder charge.\n\nJarl Gare fell asleep, dreaming of a bauble as big as his head.\n\n\n\nHe was awakened by a nudge. \"It is night,\" Waltk grunted. \"I smell it.\"\n\nGare worked one hand up through the spongy earth, poked a hole in it\nand wiped the mud from his mask's eye-piece.\n\n\"Right,\" he muttered. \"It's time to go.\" He worked his head out of the\nground and looked about.\n\nThere could be infra-red spotlights covering the very ground under\nwhich they lay. But they would have to take the chance.\n\nHis body made a sucking sound as he drew himself from the self-dug\ngrave. He reached back in and tapped Waltk. The big Jovian virtually\nerupted from the ground, the weight nothing to his mighty thews.\n\nCarefully they replaced the spongy earth. Then, with Jarl Gare in the\nlead, the pair walked upright, but quietly, to the great power-charged\nfence.\n\nIt went up twenty feet and down the same distance underground--Jarl\nGare had learned this depth from a prisoner who had tried to dig his\nway out but failed and nearly drowned as liquid seeped into the hole he\nwas digging.\n\nThe big Jovian, his thick-thewed body glimmering with sweat in the\nground light, bent to pick up Jarl Gare's slight naked body.\n\n\"Wait,\" Jarl Gare warned. \"We must wait until one of the river beasts\nstart plunging.\"\n\nThe Jovian grunted. He waited, flexing the great shoulder and back\nmuscles. Then he said suddenly, \"I smell guards.\"\n\nJarl Gare's thin face jerked up at the seven foot figure of his\ncompanion. \"Where?\" he asked tensely.\n\nThe Jovian with a quick movement shoved Jarl Gare to the ground,\ndropped flat swiftly himself and wriggled away through the short grass.\n\nJarl Gare waited quietly. The big Jovian whose eyes, trained on his\nhomeworld of darkness, penetrated the steamy fog of Venus almost as\nwell as an infra-red lamp, would take care of the guards his nostrils\nhad scented.\n\nThat was the way Jarl Gare had planned it. Waltk's strength, nearly a\ndozen times greater than that of an Earthling, his hearing developed\nto a tremendous acuity by the environment of his homeworld, and his\neyesight were the tools of Jarl's brain.\n\nIf Waltk had had Jarl's brain, he could have won a Venusian pearl, but,\nwhile Nature had given him a marvelous machine for survival, she had\nonly given him just enough brain to keep it operating.\n\nHis work would be done when they reached the Venusian pearl-beds. One\nglance at the bulky figure and the Venusians would know the weakness.\nBut it did not matter if he lost. Jarl Gare would still win a pearl.\n\n_I have no weakness_, Jarl grinned to himself, _except pride and\nthe Venusians seek out physical or mental weakness--not a character\nweakness._ He remembered the oft-told tale of the Earthman whom the\nVenusians had frightened to death, but that was because he showed that\nfear physically.\n\nThree years in The Hole and you either go raving mad or learn to mask\nevery emotion.\n\nAbruptly, Waltk was back. \"There were two,\" he said, \"Two no more.\"\n\n\"Did they have fog-piercers?\" Jarl Gare asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Waltk grunted. \"I remembered what you said.\" He handed over a\npair of glasses and the special light. \"You would not need these. I see\nenough for both of us.\"\n\nThere was a muted splash from the river.\n\nWaltk's great hands seized Jarl Gare about the waist and lifted him.\n\"Three splashes--then heave,\" Jarl Gare said.\n\nThe next splash was louder, the second louder and longer and, when the\nthird crashed into the night, Jarl Gare was flung as if from a catapult\nover the fence.\n\nAs his naked body struck the river, his mind exulted. It was perfect\ntiming, the splash of the river beast drowning out his own.\n\nJarl Gare trod water, waiting. The Jovian's hurtling figure was a dark\nblotch against the fog. Jarl swallowed a deep breath of air before the\nsplash of water from the Jovian's body struck him.\n\n\n\nThe two of them floated quietly, letting the river water grow sluggish\nagain. The splashing of the beasts grew nearer. Jarl Gare heard the big\nJovian breathing hoarsely. He said reassuringly, \"They are harmless,\nWaltk. I've told you so a dozen times.\"\n\n\"I have never seen one of them,\" Waltk said hoarsely. \"I fear nothing I\nhave seen. You have only told me of them.\"\n\nOnly a few feet away, one of the river beasts suddenly lunged out of\nthe water. Waltk squealed as the huge body loomed in the air over them,\nthen landed between them, sending spray cascading over them.\n\nWaltk struck out at the beast and then began to chuckle. Jarl Gare\nheard the chuckle through the echoes of the splash.\n\nThe beast was gone. \"Look,\" said Waltk, holding up one hand. It held a\nblob of dripping flesh. \"It is weak. I have seen it and I am unafraid.\"\n\nFor answer, Jarl Gare who had just donned the infra-red glasses, tapped\nWaltk on the shoulder and plunged under the water. He had sighted the\nray of an infra-red light on the river.\n\nJarl Gare swam under water, moving with the current. He felt the\nmovement of the water behind him and knew Waltk was following.\n\nHe angled for the far bank. On arrival he slid his head and eyes out\ncarefully. The infra-red light was far up the river, following the\njumping river beasts.\n\nWithout ripple or sound, Waltk broke the surface of the river.\n\nTheir two naked bodies glistening with the water, Jarl Gare and Waltk\nstepped out of the river and slid into the luxurious growth of the\njungle.\n\nOne step in the climb to freedom and wealth had been accomplished! Jarl\nGare chuckled, patting the mighty arms of his companion.\n\n\"Can you lead us in a straight line through the jungle if I give you a\npointer?\" Jarl Gare asked. He knew the answer--but he liked to preen\nhis ego on the knowledge that his brain had evolved the plan. Waltk\ngrunted.\n\n\"Look back at the Hole,\" Jarl Gare said.\n\nThe Jovian turned, his eyes intent. \"I see it,\" he said.\n\n\"The high radio tower?\" The Jovian, grunted. \"The guard's barracks?\"\nAgain the Jovian grunted.\n\n\"Draw an imaginary line from the tower through the center of the\nbarracks. Our path will extend along that line.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Waltk. He led Jarl Gare back up the river, watching the\ntower. He halted finally, facing across the river, and then made an\nabrupt about-face.\n\nHe closed his eyes and stood tense, unmoving as minutes dripped past.\n\n\"I have it,\" he said.\n\n_Brains_, chuckled Jarl Gare to himself. _Use every weapon, every\ntool. But it was easy. Waltk was of a race which had developed for\nself-preservation the sense of taking a straight line between two\npoints. In their vast world where landmarks were absent, it was a\nnecessity._\n\nHere on Venus that sense would lead Jarl Gare to freedom and wealth.\n\nIt was like a radio beam on the space lanes, but the Jovian needed no\nsending station. He was the station itself, able to orient himself if\nhe went off course.\n\nThey started out through the jungle--naked and unarmed--aiming straight\nfor the Venusian pearl-beds which, by Jarl Gare's estimate, lay three\nhundred miles north of the Hole. Three hundred miles between hell and\nheaven.\n\n\n\nWaltk was tireless, his great body immune to the ravages of the\nsharp-edged undergrowth and the strangling vines. He had no need of a\npath. He made his own, guided by that unfailing sense of direction.\n\nJarl Gare slid along in the Jovian's wake, his passage cleared by the\nstrength of his companion.\n\nJarl used his infra-red lamp sparingly, for fear Earth patrols might be\nwearing the special glasses and discover the beam.\n\nThe patrols were tough and relentless. They shot first and then asked\nquestions.\n\nJarl used the lamp to reassure himself, even though Waltk grunted when\nanything out of the ordinary appeared, describing it to his companion.\n\nTheir first sleep came when Jarl Gare judged they had come almost a\nthird of the distance to the pearl-beds. He suppressed the hunger pains\nin his belly by telling Waltk again the story of the Venusian pearls.\nThey lay in a cradle of a great tree whose five great arms spread out\nfrom the trunk.\n\n\"I saw one once, Waltk,\" Jarl Gare said, and his voice was soft. \"It\nwas back on Earth, and it was the property of one of the richest men\non Earth--Voltane, inventor of the force field that protects space\ncruisers from asteroids and space fragments. He gave half his wealth\nfor it. And he was rated as worth four million credits.\"\n\n\"Two million credits for a jewel? He was a fool,\" Waltk said.\n\n\"Ah, but, Waltk, you should have seen it. He displayed it once a month\nin public. And the crowds that gathered.... It was gray, but it pulsed\nand throbbed as it were alive.\"\n\nWaltk said seriously, \"I did not know the pearls were gray. I had heard\nthey were pink or red or orange. I never heard of a gray one.\"\n\n\"Nor had I,\" Jarl Gare nodded. \"But there it was. It wasn't the color\nthat attracted me, but the life force that seemed to throb within it.\n\n\"That day I decided I would have one--though I knew there were only\nfour of them on Earth. But there was no way for me to get to Venus--\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Waltk, \"You have told me. You were Earthbound because\nyou had been in Earth police custody too often. But you made a plan.\nEarthmen convicted of treason, murder and other high crimes were sent\nto The Hole. So you killed a man--\"\n\n\"And was sent to the Hole. But for you, Waltk, my plan would have\nfailed. I needed your strength--your instinct--your eyes. I promised\nyou a pearl, too.\"\n\n\"You have already given it to me,\" Waltk said quietly. \"Freedom from\nThe Hole, if only for a while. Because you led me from the Hole, I will\nhelp you until your quest is ended. I swear it.\"\n\nJarl Gare chuckled to himself. _The simple-minded brute! He thinks he's\nfree. For the moment, sure, but when he meets the Venusians he's done.\nGood riddance. A tool should be discarded if there's no more use for\nit._\n\n\n\nThe gentle touch of Waltk's big hand on his shoulder awakened him. \"The\nChameleon men,\" Waltk whispered.\n\nHastily, Jarl Gare slipped on the glasses and seized the light.\n\"Where?\" he asked.\n\n\"They are in a circle about the tree.\"\n\nJarl Gare swerved the light around the tree. A hundred yards away\nwas the edge of the circle. The infra-red showed them--dark, hunched\nfigures.\n\n\"They just seem to be waiting for something,\" Jarl Gare said.\n\n\"Us,\" Waltk said laconically.\n\nJarl Gare went through the card-catalog of his brain. The Chameleon\nmen, the Venusian natives, evolved from reptiles who walked upright,\nwere intelligent but could converse with men only through thought\npictures. They were the guardians of the pearl-beds.\n\nTheir vision in their fog world was as good if not better than Waltk's.\nThey needed no infra-red rays to penetrate the fog as the Earthmen did.\n\nThey had fought viciously against colonization by Earthmen. Despite\npunitive measures by Earth, they were not conquered and finally there\nhad been an Earth-Venus treaty.\n\nEarthmen were permitted access to the oil fields and were allowed to\ncreate The Hole. In token of the great pact, the Earth had given its\nlargest, most perfect diamond to Venus. Venus, ruled by its hierarchy\nof the Guardian Priests, had given a pearl.\n\nThe pearl had touched off cupidity on Earth--and adventurers by the\nscore had attempted to wrest others.\n\nEarth at first had sought to halt the adventurers, but Venus had\nreplied cryptically. \"Let them come. If they can obtain a pearl, they\nhave won it fairly.\"\n\nOf the hundreds who had tried, only three had won through successfully.\nOnly three had been strong enough to pass the test of weakness.\n\nIf an Earthman made it to the pearl-beds, he was given the test of\nweakness. If he passed it, he went free with a pearl of his choice. If\nhe lost, he disappeared.\n\nOnly three ... and Jarl Gare chuckled. Soon there would be four. Jarl\nGare.\n\nThe Venusians were sluggish moving and web-footed, perfectly at home on\ntheir spongy earth. But in the trees?\n\nJarl Gare spoke quietly to Waltk. \"We can escape them by traveling\nthrough the trees.\"\n\n\"I could,\" said Waltk, \"but you would be too slow. They would capture\nyou.\"\n\nJarl Gare looked at Waltk appraisingly. \"On your back, I would not slow\nyou too much.\"\n\nWaltk grinned widely, his moon face wrinkling. He laughed throatily.\n\"You would not slow me at all. I had not thought of that.\"\n\nJarl Gare's ray gun swept the circle again. \"I wish I could see them,\"\nhe said. \"I'd like to know what they looked like if I met them face to\nface.\"\n\nWaltk's eyes turned to one of the waiting figures. \"They are as tall\nas you. Their heads are conical, set on sloping shoulders without much\nneck. Their bodies are mottled green and red and brown. They carry\ntwo-pronged spears. Their feet are webbed.\"\n\n\"I have seen pictures of them,\" Jarl Gare said. \"But they weren't\ncolored. I remember reading that they can change the colors of their\nskin to blend with surroundings.\"\n\n\"They blend well,\" Waltk said. \"It was difficult for me to see them at\nfirst after I had sensed them.\"\n\nWaltk slung Jarl Gare on his back. A tensing of his mighty thews and\none leap took them to a tree thirty feet away. Then they were swinging\nswiftly through the upper reaches of the forest, propelled by the\nJovian's strength, made even more powerful by the lesser gravitational\npull of Venus.\n\nA mile away Waltk halted, while Jarl Gare swept the forest behind him\nwith the infra-red ray. He laughed. \"They're still sitting there,\nwaiting for us.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Waltk. \"It is easier to travel in the trees.\"\n\nHe resumed the role of carrier, and went plunging on.\n\n\n\nThe hours of flight through the trees seemed hardly to touch the\nreserves of the Jovian's strength.\n\nBut suddenly, abruptly, he halted.\n\n\"We cannot go further through the trees,\" he said to a puzzled Jarl\nGare.\n\n\"The end of the forest ahead?\" Jarl Gare asked. \"That means we're less\nthan a hundred Earth miles from the beds.\"\n\n\"No,\" Waltk said. \"Not the end of the forest. There is something I\ndon't understand. I feel a pressure ahead of us ... as if some horrible\nfate awaits us.\"\n\nJarl Gare's first reaction was to brush away Waltk's fears as if merely\ncaused by not understanding what lay ahead. It was like Waltk's fear\nof the water beasts. But then he remembered the intuitive sense the\nJovians had.\n\n\"We'd better go down, then,\" Jarl Gare decided.\n\n\"No,\" said Waltk. \"It is the same there.\"\n\n\"Then we'll go around it. Come on.\"\n\nAn ironic smile blossomed on Waltk's moon face.\n\n\"It is the same everywhere,\" he said. \"To either side, above, below,\nahead and behind us.\"\n\nJarl Gare, whose fierce desire for a Venusian pearl had lifted him\nabove panic, felt only a twinge of exasperation.\n\n\"I feel nothing,\" he said, irritated. \"Why can't we keep going?\"\n\nThe Jovian shrugged. \"I feel we can't.\"\n\n\"Hell,\" said Jarl Gare, \"I'll go down and show you.\"\n\nJarl Gare's wiry, whip-scarred body slid down the limb on which they\nstood until it reached the crotch of the huge tree. He started down the\ntrunk. Waltk watched him quietly.\n\nJarl Gare stopped suddenly. Then, slowly, he inched his way back up the\ntrunk to the limb where the Jovian stood.\n\n\"I see what you mean,\" he said. \"This was something I hadn't figured\non.\" He sat down on the limb, letting his legs dangle.\n\nWhatever had them hemmed in wasn't intangible. It was real. His foot\nhad touched it. It had felt cold and gave slightly. Jarl Gare brought\nthe foot up and looked at the toes. They looked unharmed, but seemed\nnumb.\n\nHe pinched them and felt no more sensation than if they had grown numb\nfrom loss of circulation. They were cold to his touch.\n\nWas that force thin-skinned like a balloon or solid as a plasticine\nball?\n\n\"Waltk,\" he said, \"Break me off a good-sized branch.\"\n\nThe Jovian slid farther out on the limb, snapped off a branch the\nthickness of his wrist and about three feet long and brought it to Jarl\nGare.\n\n\"Watch it closely,\" he ordered Waltk.\n\nHe dropped the heavy branch. It fell about twenty feet, and stopped\nabruptly. Then slowly, like a ruptured duralloy canoe, it started\ndownward again, but gaining speed. It struck the ground, but neither\nWaltk nor Jarl Gare could hear it strike.\n\nThen the force wasn't solid.\n\nHe became aware that the foot which had touched the force was beginning\nto tingle. The power it released to numb was only temporary then.\n\nJarl Gare chuckled. Their bodies might be numbed for a while, but they\nwould be free of the force.\n\nQuickly, he slid down the branch again. At approximately the same spot\nwhere he'd stopped before, he halted again and reached out tentatively\nwith his toes, touching the numbness.\n\nHe looked back at Waltk. \"Follow me,\" he ordered.\n\nThen Jarl Gare jumped. It was like leaping into frigid water from a\nsteaming shower bath. The shock wiped the consciousness from Jarl\nGare, but not before he felt his body falling freely. He didn't feel\nthe lesser shock as his body struck the spongy sward of the jungle.\n\n\n\nAwareness that his face hurt came to Jarl Gare first. It was a\nrecurring pain. First it stung, then the pain retreated. Then it stung\nagain....\n\nHe realized that someone was methodically slapping his face. He opened\nhis eyes. Waltk stopped slapping him.\n\nThe big Jovian was grinning. \"It is all above us now,\" he said.\n\nJarl Gare stood up, and almost fell down again, staggering, feeling no\nsensation in his legs.\n\nWaltk supported him. \"It will leave. My body is tingling only\npleasantly now.\"\n\nSensations came back quickly. Even Jarl's eyes began to tingle in\nharmony with the thousand prickles that coursed over his body.\n\nFinally he could limp along and as the power returned to his muscles he\nbegan to step out briskly.\n\n\"What was it?\" Waltk asked.\n\nJarl Gare shrugged. \"I don't know for sure, but it must have been some\nsort of thin force field--able to resist concerted pressure, but not\nquick, sharp shocks like our leaping bodies.\"\n\nThe tangled jungle finally dwindled away and the pair were striding\nacross fields rich with vegetation.\n\n\"It is beautiful,\" Waltk declared. \"Such bright colors shining like\njewels through this fog.\"\n\nJarl Gare glanced at Waltk sharply, and then at the gray vegetation.\nHe grinned. \"I wish I had your eyes, Waltk, or been raised on Jupiter\nwhere I'd have to develop such keen perception.\"\n\nWaltk shrugged his big shoulders. \"You Earthmen have good eyes, too,\nbut you do not need them as much as we do.\"\n\n\"Are we still heading right?\" Jarl Gare asked.\n\nWaltk nodded. They plodded on.\n\nThat night they supped on a queer animal that Waltk had run down and\nthrottled with his bare hands. It tasted like beef-steak. Waltk ate\nprodigiously, but Jarl Gare, who wanted to be sharp and quick on the\nmorrow, ate sparingly.\n\nDuring the night, Jarl awakened several times, his nerves on edge for\nthe test he knew lay ahead, but Waltk slept heavily.\n\nWhen they awakened the Chameleon men were there.\n\nWaltk was on his feet instantly, his great hands reaching out. Jarl\ncame to his feet more slowly, wondering that the Chameleon men had not\nslain them while they slept.\n\nThe skins of the Chameleon men were a mottled gray, colored to match\nthe gray background in which they lived, he observed. There were a\ndozen of them ranged around the big Jovian and the slight Earthman.\nTheir barbed two-pronged spears were held lightly in their webbed\nhands, and their lidless eyes stared blankly at the naked pair.\n\nJarl Gare waited quietly, one hand on the powerful biceps of his\ncompanion.\n\nFinally, he became aware of a picture growing in his mind. Of a vine\nand tree-latticed river spouting out of a jungle into a deep pool. All\naround the edges of the pool were stacked great piles of huge oyster\nshells.\n\nThe surface of the pool broke regularly, conical heads popped out\nand the mottled bodies swam toward shore, depositing the huge shells\nwhere they were taken by other Chameleon men, expertly split open and\nexamined.\n\nOne out of three yielded a pulsating pearl.\n\nThen into Jarl Gare's mind came another picture. He and Waltk leaping\nthrough the trees, then jumping through the force field, finally coming\nto the fields, leaving the jungle behind. Then a picture of the pearl\nbeds again. Now a picture of strange men--wrestling with the Chameleon\nmen, throwing great weights, leaping, diving into the pool, racing\nagainst the Chameleon men in their own element.\n\nA great sigh lifted Jarl Gare's breast.\n\n\"Waltk,\" he cried. \"We have passed all but the final test. One more,\nand the pearls are ours.\"\n\nThe Chameleon men nodded and turned, to march ahead of them across the\nfields.\n\nJarl Gare was exulting. \"I will win a pearl--a glorious gray pearl\npulsing with life and beauty. I have no weakness, Waltk. My quest is\nalmost over.\"\n\nWaltk said quietly, \"You have a weakness, Jarl. Perhaps I can help you.\"\n\nJarl Gare drew his slight body taut. \"I need no help now, Waltk. I\nused you when I needed you. I don't need you any longer. I will win out\nalone. With all your strength, you are weaker than I.\"\n\nWaltk stared at him. \"You do not like me? You have just used what I\nhave to help yourself?\"\n\n\"Yes, you big dumb ox,\" Jarl Gare gloated. \"Your weakness is too\nobvious. You're strong, but the Venusians have tests for such strength,\nand even your mighty body will fail.\"\n\n\"And you have no weakness?\" Waltk asked. \"Suppose they give you the\ntest of strength?\"\n\n\"The Chameleon men don't do it that way. They read your mind, almost,\nand figure out a test that should not be impossible, if you are\nuniformly strong in body, mind and courage. The test is for all three,\nand you must have the brains to go with strength.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Waltk said, and when he looked at Jarl Gare, there was almost\na sense of pity in the glance.\n\n\n\nAt last they came to the pool. Out of the fog-shrouded lake came the\nChameleon men, their bodies dripping, their webbed hands carrying the\ngreat shells.\n\nThe band of Chameleon men leading the Jovian and the Earthman\nhalted. Two of them dived into the pool. After long minutes the pair\nreappeared, lugging between them a gigantic clam.\n\nThey set it down before Waltk. They stared at Waltk. Finally, Waltk\ngrinned and nodded. With their metal spears, four of the Chameleon men\npried open the bi-valve, and held it open by standing on the shell\nedges.\n\nWaltk flexed his great muscles and clamped a huge hand on each shell\nedge.\n\nJarl Gare's yellow eyes widened. Waltk's test was to hold open the\nclam, a prodigious feat. For how long? One of the Chameleon men glanced\nat Jarl Gare and he saw a picture of darkness descending on the pool.\nWhy, that must be six hours.\n\nThe four Venusians stepped off the shell. The clam's writhing muscles\nand the great writhing muscles of the Jovian's back tensed together.\n\nThe Chameleon men stared blankly at the striving pair. Jarl Gare\nwatched passively. If the dumb ox couldn't figure out that all he\nhad to do was to shove the clam open still further instead of bracing\nagainst closure, he would lose the test.\n\nThe moments dripped by, became minutes marked by the jumping back and\nshoulder muscles of the Jovian.\n\nAn hour passed sluggishly.... Waltk's usually white face became\nsuffused with red. His chest was laboring.\n\nAt the end of two hours, Waltk glanced appealingly over his shoulder at\nJarl Gare. The Earthman laughed. With a convulsive effort, Waltk pushed\nback the shells six inches either way.\n\nIf he had done that at first, he could have won, Jarl Gare thought, but\nnot now. Waltk's strength had been drained too greatly.\n\nThe great shells quivered, moving back. Waltk strained, but the\nJovian's great muscles could hold no longer. The Jovian's huge body\nquivered, the skin grew almost black with his great effort.\n\nThe clam had the leverage now. Its white muscles pulsed. The Jovian\ngrunted with pain. There was a deep _thucking_ sound. Waltk whimpered.\n\nThen the Jovian stood up. He stared at the blood pulsing from the\nstumps of his wrists. The clam had sheared off his hands.\n\n\"Sorry,\" Jarl Gare said. And laughed.\n\nThe Jovian's face convulsed with fury. Then he relaxed. His moon face\nwas smiling as he looked at Jarl Gare.\n\n\"Your turn now,\" he said.\n\nThe Venusians gathered around Waltk. One of them took a pouch from\nbeneath his breech clout. His webbed fingers dug in and came out with\na salve that he smeared on the spurting wrist stumps. The blood ceased\nspurting.\n\nThen the Venusians turned to Jarl Gare.\n\nThey circled him, but broke the circle a little to let a wizened\nVenusian through. He was carrying a Venusian pearl. Jarl Gare gasped\nat the size of the pearl. He reached out for it, but the old wizened\nVenusian drew back and a picture grew in Gare's mind.\n\n\"You're going to hide it in an oyster shell, and throw that shell in\nwith a pile of others?\"\n\nThe conical wrinkled head bowed. The wizened oldster reached into a\npouch inside his breech clout and pulled out a handful of gray powder.\nThe Venusians moved toward the pool, forcing Jarl Gare to move along\nwith them.\n\nAt the pool's edge, the old Venusian dipped in a wrinkled hand and drew\nout a handful of water. He mixed the water with the powder until it\nbecame the consistency of paste. Jarl Gare watched as the old Venusian\nsmeared the oyster shell one of the other Chameleon men handed him with\nthe grayish paste.\n\nThen Jarl Gare saw the great, gray pearl handed to the old man. He\nplaced the pearl in the shell. Then the other Venusians turned Jarl\nGare away from the oldster, one of them placing his cold webbed fingers\nacross the Earthman's eyes.\n\nJarl Gare heard the rattle of the old shells, other rustling motions\nbehind him as he waited. What test was this the Chameleon men were\nplanning?\n\nFinally, the hands dropped from his eyes. He turned around. The oldster\nwas pointing at a huge pile of the oyster shells.\n\n\n\nA picture was in Jarl Gare's mind again. So they wanted him to find the\nshell? That was a fine test! All the shells were gray, and the pile to\nwhich the elder pointed was approximately twenty feet high. How could\nhe find one gray shell among so many other gray ones?\n\nHe looked up and saw Waltk grinning at him, the stumps of his arms\nfolded.\n\n\"How can I find it?\" he asked Waltk. \"One gray one among so many\nothers?\"\n\n\"Gray?\" asked Waltk. \"It is not gray. It sticks out of that pile like a\ntorch. The shell is smeared with red.\"\n\n\"Red?\" asked Jarl Gare curiously. \"Red?
