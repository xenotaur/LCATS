    "body": "The tall man loitered a moment before a garish window display, his eyes\nimpassive in his space-burned face, as the Lillis patrolman passed.\nThen he turned, burying his long chin in the folds of his sand cape,\nand took up the pursuit of the dark figure ahead once more.\n\nAbove, the city's multicolored lights were reflected from the\ntranslucent Dome--a distant, subtly distorted Lillis, through which the\nstars shone dimly.\n\nGetting through that dome had been his first urgent problem, but now he\nhad another, and a more pressing one. It had been simple enough to pass\nhimself off as an itinerant prospector and gain entrance to the city,\nafter his ship had crashed in the Mare Cimmerium. But the rest would\nnot be so simple. He had to acquire a spaceman's identity card, and he\nhad to do it fast. It was only a matter of time until the Triplanet\nPatrol gave up the misleading trail he had made into the hill country,\nand concluded that he must have reached Lillis. After that, his only\nsafety lay in shipping out on a freighter as soon as possible. He had\nto get off Mars, because his trail was warm, and the Patrol thorough.\n\nThey knew, of course, that he was an outlaw--the very fact of the\ncrashed, illegally-armed ship would have told them that. But they\ndidn't know that he was Syme Rector, the most-wanted and most-feared\nraider in the System. In that was his only advantage.\n\nHe walked a little faster, as his quarry turned up a side street and\nthen boarded a moving ramp to an upper level. He watched until the\nshort, wide-shouldered figure in spaceman's harness disappeared over\nthe top of the ramp, and then followed.\n\nThe man was waiting for him at the mouth of the ascending tunnel.\n\nSyme looked at him casually, without a flicker of expression, and\nstarted to walk on, but the other stepped into his path. He was quite\nyoung, Syme saw, with a fighter's shoulders under the white leather,\nand a hard, determined thrust to his firm jaw.\n\n\"All right,\" the boy said quietly. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Syme said.\n\n\"The game, the angle. You've been following me. Do you want trouble?\"\n\n\"Why, no,\" Syme told him bewilderedly. \"I haven't been following you.\nI--\"\n\nThe boy knuckled his chin reflectively. \"You could be lying,\" he said\nfinally. \"But maybe I've made a mistake.\" Then--\"Okay, citizen, you can\nclear--but don't let me catch you on my tail again.\"\n\nSyme murmured something and turned away, feeling the spaceman's eyes\non the small of his back until he turned the corner. At the next\nstreet he took a ramp up, crossed over and came down on the other side\na block away. He waited until he saw the boy's broad figure pass the\nintersection, and then followed again more cautiously.\n\nIt was risky, but there was no other way. The signatures, the data,\neven the photograph on the card could be forged once Syme got his hands\non it, but the identity card itself--that oblong of dark diamondite,\nglowing with the tiny fires of radioactivity--that could not be\nimitated, and the only way to get it was to kill.\n\nUp ahead was the Founders' Tower, the tallest building in Lillis. The\nboy strode into the entrance lobby, bought a ticket for the observation\nplatform, and took the elevator. As soon as his car was out of sight in\nthe transparent tube, Syme followed. He put a half-credit slug into the\nmachine, took the punctured slip of plastic that came out. The ticket\nwent into a scanning slot in the wall of the car, and the elevator\nwhisked him up.\n\n\n\nThe tower was high, more than a hundred meters above the highest level\nof the city, and the curved dome that kept air in Lillis was close\noverhead. Syme looked up, after his first appraising glance about the\nplatform, and saw the bright-blue pinpoint of Earth. The sight stirred\na touch of nostalgia in him, as it always did, but he put it aside.\n\nThe boy was hunched over the circular balustrade a little distance\naway. Except for him, the platform was empty. Syme loosened his slim,\ndeadly energy pistol in its holster and padded catlike toward the\nsilent figure.\n\nIt was over in a minute. The boy whirled as he came up, warned by\nsome slight sound, or by the breath of Syme's passage in the still\nair. He opened his mouth to shout, and brought up his arm in a swift,\ninstinctive gesture. But the blow never landed. Syme's pistol spat its\nsilent white pencil of flame, and the boy crumpled to the floor with a\nminute, charred hole in the white leather over his chest.\n\nSyme stooped over him swiftly, found a thick wallet and thrust it into\nhis pocket without a second glance. Then he raised the body in his arms\nand thrust it over the parapet.\n\nIt fell, and in the same instant Syme felt a violent tug at his wrist.\nBefore he could move to stop himself, he was over the edge. Too late,\nhe realized what had happened--one of the hooks on the dead spaceman's\nharness had caught the heavy wristband of his chronometer. He was\nfalling, linked to the body of his victim!\n\nHardly knowing what he did, he lashed out wildly with his other arm,\nfelt his fingertips catch and bite into the edge of the balustrade. His\nbody hit the wall of the tower with a thump, and, a second later, the\ncorpse below him hit the wall. Then they both hung there, swaying a\nlittle and Syme's fingers slipped a little with each motion.\n\nGritting his teeth, he brought the magnificent muscles of his arm into\nplay, raising the forearm against the dead weight of the dangling body.\nFraction by slow fraction of an inch, it came up. Syme could feel the\nsweat pouring from his brow, running saltily into his eyes. His arms\nfelt as if they were being torn from their sockets. Then the hook\nslipped free, and the tearing, unbearable weight vanished.\n\nThe reaction swung Syme against the building again, and he almost\nlost his slippery hold on the balustrade. After a moment he heard the\nspaceman's body strike with a squashy thud, somewhere below.\n\nHe swung up his other arm, got a better grip on the balustrade. He\ntried cautiously to get a leg up, but the motion loosened his hold on\nthe smooth surface again. He relaxed, thinking furiously. He could hold\non for another minute at most; then it was the final blast-off.\n\nHe heard running footsteps, and then a pale face peered over the ledge\nat him. He realized suddenly that the whole incident could have taken\nonly a few seconds. He croaked, \"Get me up.\"\n\nWordlessly, the man clasped thin fingers around his wrist. The other\npulled, with much puffing and panting, and with his help Syme managed\nto get a leg over the edge and hoist his trembling body to safety.\n\n\"Are you all right?\"\n\n\n\nSyme looked at the man, nursing the tortured muscles of his arms. His\nrescuer was tall and thin, of indeterminate age. He had light, sandy\nhair, a sharp nose, and--oddly conflicting--pale, serious eyes and a\nhumorous wide mouth. He was still panting.\n\n\"I'm not hurt,\" Syme said. He grinned, his white teeth flashing in his\ndark, lean face. \"Thanks for giving me a hand.\"\n\n\"You scared hell out of me,\" said the man. \"I heard a thud. I\nthought--you'd gone over.\" He looked at Syme questioningly.\n\n\"That was my bag,\" the outlaw said quickly. \"It slipped out of my hand,\nand I overbalanced myself when I grabbed for it.\"\n\nThe man sighed. \"I need a drink. _You_ need a drink. Come on.\" He\npicked up a small black suitcase from the floor and started for the\nelevator, then stopped. \"Oh--your bag. Shouldn't we do something about\nthat?\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Syme, taking his arm. \"The shock must have busted it\nwide open. My laundry is probably all over Lillis by now.\"\n\nThey got off at the amusement level, three tiers down, and found a\ncafe around the corner. Syme wasn't worried about the man he had just\nkilled. He had heard no second thud, so the body must have stayed on\nthe first outcropping of the tower it struck. It probably wouldn't be\nfound until morning.\n\nAnd he had the wallet. When he paid for the first round of _culcha_, he\ntook it out and stole a glance at the identification card inside. There\nit was--his ticket to freedom. He began feeling expansive, and even\nfriendly toward the slender, mouse-like man across the table. It was\nthe _culcha_, of course. He knew it, and didn't care. In the morning\nhe'd find a freighter berth--in as big a spaceport as Lillis, there\nwere always jobs open. Meanwhile, he might as well enjoy himself, and\nit was safer to be seen with a companion than to be alone.\n\nHe listened lazily to what the other was saying, leaning his tall,\ngraceful body back into the softly-cushioned seat.\n\n\"Lissen,\" said Harold Tate. He leaned forward on one elbow, slipped,\ncaught himself, and looked at the elbow reproachfully. \"Lissen,\" he\nsaid again, \"I trust you, Jones. You're obvi-obviously an adventurer,\nbut you have an honest face. I can't see it very well at the moment,\nbut I hic!--pardon--seem to recall it as an honest face. I'm going to\ntell you something, because I need your help!--help.\" He paused. \"I\nneed a guide. D'you know this part of Mars well?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Syme absently. Out in the center of the floor, an AG\nplate had been turned on. Five Venusian girls were diving and twisting\nin its influence, propelling themselves by the motion of their\ndelicately-webbed feet and trailing long gauzy streamers of synthesilk\nafter them. Syme watched them through narrowed lids, feeling the glow\nof _culcha_ inside him.\n\n\"I wanta go to Kal-Jmar,\" said Tate.\n\nSyme snapped to attention, every nerve tingling. An indefinable sense,\na hunch that had served him well before, told him that something big\nwas coming--something that promised adventure and loot for Syme Rector.\n\"Why?\" he asked softly. \"Why to Kal-Jmar?\"\n\nHarold Tate told him, and later, when Syme had taken him to his rooms,\nhe showed him what was in his little black suitcase. Syme had been\nright; it was big.\n\n\n\nKal-Jmar was the riddle of the Solar System. It was the only remaining\ncity of the ancient Martian race--the race that, legends said, had\nrisen to greater heights than any other Solar culture. The machines,\nthe artifacts, the records of the Martians were all there, perfectly\npreserved inside the city's bubble-like dome, after God knew how many\nthousands of years. But they couldn't be reached.\n\nFor Kal-Jmar's dome was not the thing of steelite that protected\nLillis: it was a tenuous, globular field of force that defied analysis\nas it defied explosives and diamond drills. The field extended both\nabove and below the ground, and tunneling was of no avail. No one knew\nwhat had happened to the Martians, whether they were the ancestors of\nthe present decadent Martian race, or a different species. No one knew\nanything about them or about Kal-Jmar.\n\nIn the early days, when the conquest of Mars was just beginning, Earth\nscientists had been wild to get into the city. They had observed it\nfrom every angle, taken photographs of its architecture and the robots\nthat still patrolled its fantastically winding streets, and then they\nhad tried everything they knew to pierce the wall.\n\nLater, however, when every unsuccessful attempt had precipitated a\nbloody uprising of the present-day Martians--resulting in a rapid\ndwindling of the number of Martians--the Mars Protectorate had stepped\nin and forbidden any further experiments; forbidden, in fact, any\nEarthman to go near the place.\n\nThus matter had stood for over a hundred years, until Harold Tate.\nTate, a physicist, had stumbled on a field that seemed to be identical\nin properties to the Kal-Jmar dome; and what is more, he had found a\nforce that would break it down.\n\nAnd so he had made his first trip to Mars, and within twenty-four\nhours, by the blindest of chances, blurted out his secret to Syme\nRector, the scourge of the spaceways, the man with a thousand credits\non his sleek, tigerish head.\n\nSyme's smile was not tigerish now; it was carefully, studiedly mild.\nFor Tate was no longer drunk, and it was important that it should not\noccur to him that he had been indiscreet.\n\n\"This is native territory we're coming to, Harold,\" he said. \"Better\nstrap on your gun.\"\n\n\"Why. Are they really dangerous?\"\n\n\"They're unpredictable,\" Syme told him. \"They're built differently, and\nthey think differently. They breathe like us, down in their caverns\nwhere there's air, but they also eat sand, and get their oxygen that\nway.\"\n\n\"Yes, I've heard about that,\" Tate said. \"Iron oxide--very interesting\nmetabolism.\" He got his energy pistol out of the compartment and\nstrapped it on absently.\n\nSyme turned the little sand car up a gentle rise towards the tortuous\nhill country in the distance. \"Not only that,\" he continued. \"They\neat the damndest stuff. Lichens and fungi and tumble-grass off the\ndeserts--all full of deadly poisons, from arsenic up the line to\nxopite. They seem intelligent enough--in their own way--but they never\ncome near our cities and they either can't or won't learn Terrestrial.\nWhen the first colonists came here, they had to learn _their_ crazy\nlanguage. Every word of it can mean any one of a dozen different\nthings, depending on the inflection you give it. I can speak it some,\nbut not much. Nobody can. We don't think the same.\"\n\n\"So you think they might attack us?\" Tate asked again, nervously.\n\n\"They _might_ do anything,\" Syme said curtly. \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nThe hills were much closer than they had seemed, because of Mars'\ndeceptively low horizon. In half an hour they were in the midst of a\nwilderness of fantastically eroded dunes and channels, laboring on\nsliding treads up the sides of steep hills only to slither down again\non the other side.\n\n\n\nSyme stopped the car abruptly as a deep, winding channel appeared\nacross their path. \"Gully,\" he announced. \"Shall we cross it, or follow\nit?\"\n\nTate peered through the steelite nose of the car. \"Follow, I guess,\"\nhe offered. \"It seems to go more or less where we're going, and if we\ncross it we'll only come to a couple dozen more.\"\n\nSyme nodded and moved the sand car up to the edge of the gully. Then he\npressed a stud on the control board; a metal arm extruded from the tail\nof the car and a heavy spike slowly unscrewed from it, driving deep\ninto the sand. A light on the board flashed, indicating that the spike\nwas in and would bear the car's weight, and Syme started the car over\nthe edge.\n\nAs the little car nosed down into the gully, the metal arm left behind\nrevealed itself to be attached to a length of thick, very strong wire\ncable, with a control cord inside. They inched down the almost vertical\nincline, unreeling the cable behind them, and starting minor landslides\nas they descended.\n\nFinally they touched bottom. Syme pressed another stud, and above, the\nmetal spike that had supported them screwed itself out of the ground\nagain and the cable reeled in.\n\nTate had been watching with interest. \"Very ingenious,\" he said. \"But\nhow do we get up again?\"\n\n\"Most of these gullies peter out gradually,\" said Syme, \"but if we want\nor have to climb out where it's deep, we have a little harpoon gun that\nshoots the anchor up on top.\"\n\n\"Good. I shouldn't like to stay down here for the rest of my\nnatural life. Depressing view.\" He looked up at the narrow strip of\nalmost-black sky visible from the floor of the gully, and shook his\nhead.\n\nNeither Syme nor Tate ever had a chance to test the efficiency of their\nharpoon gun. They had traveled no more than five hundred meters, and\nthe gully was as deep as ever, when Tate, looking up, saw a deeper\nblackness blot out part of the black sky directly overhead. He shouted,\n\"Look out!\" and grabbed for the nearest steering lever.\n\nThe car wheeled around in a half circle and ran into the wall of the\ngully. Syme was saying, \"What--?\" when there was a thunderous crash\nthat shook the sturdy walls of the car, as a huge boulder smashed into\nthe ground immediately to their left.\n\nWhen the smoky red dust had cleared away, they saw that the left tread\nof the sand car was crushed beyond all recognition.\n\nSyme was cursing slowly and steadily with a deep, seething anger. Tate\nsaid, \"I guess we walk from here on.\" Then he looked up again and\ncaught a glimpse of the horde of beasts that were rushing up the gully\ntoward them.\n\n\"My God!\" he said. \"What are those?\"\n\nSyme looked. \"Those,\" he said bitterly, \"are Martians.\"\n\nThe natives, like all Martian fauna, were multi-legged. Also like all\nMartian fauna, they moved so fast that you couldn't see how many legs\nthey did have. Actually, however, the natives had six legs apiece--or,\nmore properly, four legs and two arms. Their lungs were not as large\nas they appeared, being collapsed at the moment. What caused the bulge\nthat made their torsos look like sausages was a huge air bladder, with\na valve arrangement from the stomach and feeding directly into the\nbloodstream.\n\nTheir faces were vaguely canine, but the foreheads were high, and the\nlips were not split. They did resemble dogs, in that their thick black\nfur was splotched with irregulate patches of white. These patches of\nwhite were subject to muscular control and could be spread out fanwise;\nor, conversely, the black could be expanded to cover the white, which\nhelped to take care of the extremes of Martian temperature. Right now\nthey were mostly black.\n\nThe natives slowed down and spread out to surround the wrecked sand\ncar, and it could be seen that most of them were armed with spears,\nalthough some had the slim Benson energy guns--strictly forbidden to\nMartians.\n\nSyme stopped cursing and watched tensely. Tate said nothing, but he\nswallowed audibly.\n\nOne Martian, who looked exactly like all the rest, stepped forward and\nmotioned unmistakably for the two to come out. He waited a moment and\nthen gestured with his energy gun. That gun, Syme knew from experience,\ncould burn through a small thickness of steelite if held on the same\nspot long enough.\n\n\n\n\"Come on,\" Syme said grimly. He rose and reached for a pressure suit,\nand Tate followed him.\n\n\"What do you think they'll--\" he began, and then stopped himself. \"I\nknow. They're unpredictable.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Syme, and opened the door. The air in the car _whooshed_\ninto the near-vacuum outside, and he and Tate stepped out.\n\nThe Martian leader looked at them enigmatically, then turned and\nstarted off. The other natives closed in on them, and they all bounded\nalong under the weak gravity.\n\nThey bounded along for what Syme figured as a good kilometer and a\nhalf, and they then reached a branch in the gully and turned down\nit, going lower all the time. Under the light of their helmet lamps,\nthey could see the walls of the gully--a tunnel, now--getting darker\nand more solid. Finally, when Syme estimated they were about nine\nkilometers down, there was even a suggestion of moisture.\n\nThe tunnel debouched at last into a large cavern. There was a\nphosphorescent gleam from fungus along the walls, but Syme couldn't\ndecide how far away the far wall was. He noticed something else, though.\n\n\"There's air here,\" he said to Tate. \"I can see dust motes in it.\" He\nswitched his helmet microphone from radio over to the audio membrane\non the outside of the helmet. \"_Kalis methra_,\" he began haltingly,\n\"_seltin guna getal._\"\n\n\"Yes, there is air here,\" said the Martian leader, startlingly. \"Not\nenough for your use, however, so do not open your helmets.\"\n\nSyme swore amazedly.\n\n\"I thought you said they didn't speak Terrestrial,\" Tate said. Syme\nignored him.\n\n\"We had our reasons for not doing so,\" the Martian said.\n\n\"But how--?\"\n\n\"We are telepaths, of course. On a planet which is nearly airless on\nits surface, we have to be. A tendency of the Terrestrial mind is to\nignore the obvious. We have not had a spoken language of our own for\nseveral thousand years.\"\n\nHe darted a glance at Syme's darkly scowling face. His own hairy face\nwas expressionless, but Syme sensed that he was amused. \"Yes, you're\nright,\" he said. \"The language you and your fellows struggled to learn\nis a fraud, a hodge-podge concocted to deceive you.\"\n\nTate looked interested. \"But why this--this gigantic masquerade?\"\n\n\"You had nothing to give us,\" the Martian said simply.\n\nTate frowned, then flushed. \"You mean you avoided revealing yourselves\nbecause you--had nothing to gain from mental intercourse with us?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nTate thought again. \"But--\"\n\n\"No,\" the Martian interrupted him, \"revealing the extent of our\ncivilization would have spared us nothing at your people's hands. Yours\nis an imperialist culture, and you would have had Mars, whether you\nthought you were taking it from equals or not.\"\n\n\"Never mind that,\" Syme broke in impatiently. \"What do you want with\nus?\"\n\nThe Martian looked at him appraisingly. \"You already suspect.\nUnfortunately, you must die.\"\n\n\n\nIt was a weird situation, Syme thought. His mind was racing, but as yet\nhe could see no way out. He began to wonder, if he did, could he keep\nthe Martians from knowing about it? Then he realized that the Martian\nmust have received that thought, too, and he was enraged. He stood,\nholding himself in check with an effort.\n\n\"Will you tell us why?\" Tate asked.\n\n\"You were brought here for that purpose. It is part of our conception\nof justice. I will tell you and your--friend--anything you wish to\nknow.\"\n\nSyme noticed that the other Martians had retired to the farther side of\nthe cavern. Some were munching the glowing fungus. That left only the\nleader, who was standing alertly on all fours a short distance away\nfrom them, holding the Benson gun trained on them. Syme tried not to\nthink about the gun, especially about making a grab for it. It was like\ntrying not to think of the word \"hippopotamus.\"\n\nTate squatted down comfortably on the floor of the cavern, apparently\nunconcerned, but his hands were trembling slightly. \"First why--\" he\nbegan.\n\n\"There are many secrets in Kal-Jmar,\" the Martian said, \"among them a\nvery simple catalyzing agent which could within fifty years transform\nMars to a planet with Terrestrially-thick atmosphere.\"\n\n\"I think I see,\" Tate said thoughtfully. \"That's been the ultimate aim\nall along, but so far the problem has us licked. If we solved it, then\nwe'd have all of Mars, not just the cities. Your people would die out.\nYou couldn't have that, of course.\"\n\nHe sighed deeply. He spread his gloved hands before him and looked\nat them with a queer intentness. \"Well--how about the Martians--the\nKal-Jmar Martians, I mean? I'd dearly love to know the answer to that\none.\"\n\n\"Neither of the alternatives in your mind is correct. They were not a\nseparate species, although they were unlike us. But they were not our\nancestors, either. They were the contemporaries of our ancestors.\"\n\n\"Several thousand years ago Mars' loss of atmosphere began to make\nitself felt. There were two ways out. Some chose to seal themselves\ninto cities like Kal-Jmar; our ancestors chose to adapt their bodies to\nthe new conditions. Thus the race split. Their answer to the problem\nwas an evasion; they remained static. Our answer was the true one, for\nwe progressed. We progressed beyond the need of science; they remained\nits slaves. They died of a plague--and other causes.\n\n\"You see,\" he finished gently, \"our deception has caused a natural\nconfusion in your minds. They were the degenerates, not we.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" Tate mused, \"you are being destroyed by contact with\nan--inferior--culture.\"\n\n\"We hope to win yet,\" the Martian said.\n\nTate stood up, his face very white. \"Tell me one thing,\" he begged.\n\"Will our two races ever live together in amity?\"\n\nThe Martian lowered his head. \"That is for unborn generations.\" He\nlooked at Tate again and aimed the energy gun. \"You are a brave man,\"\nhe said. \"I am sorry.\"\n\nSyme saw all his hopes of treasure and glory go glimmering down the\nsights of the Martian's Benson gun, and suddenly the pent-up rage in\nhim exploded. Too swiftly for his intention to be telegraphed, before\nhe knew himself what he meant to do, he hurled himself bodily into the\nMartian.\n\n\n\nIt was like tangling with a draft horse. The Martian was astonishingly\nstrong. Syme scrambled desperately for the gun, got it, but couldn't\ntear it out of the Martian's fingers. And all the time he could almost\nfeel the Martian's telepathic call for help surging out. He heard the\nswift pad of his followers coming across the cavern.\n\nHe put everything he had into one mighty, murderous effort. Every\nmuscle fiber in his superbly trained body crackled and surged with\npower. He roared his fury. And the gun twisted out of the Martian's\niron grip!\n\nHe clubbed the prostrate leader with it instantly, then reversed the\nweapon and snapped a shot at the nearest Martian. The creature dropped\nhis lance and fell without a sound.\n\nThe next instant a ray blinked at him, and he rolled out of the way\nbarely in time. The searing ray cut a swath over the leader's body and\nswerved to cut down on him. Still rolling, he fired at the holder of\nthe weapon. The gun dropped and winked out on the floor.\n\nSyme jumped to his feet and faced his enemies, snarling like the\ntrapped tiger he was. Another ray slashed at him, and he bent lithely\nto let it whistle over his head. Another, lower this time. He flipped\nhis body into the air and landed upright, his gun still blazing. His\nright leg burned fiercely from a ray-graze, but he ignored it. And\nall the while he was mowing down the massed natives in great swaths,\nseeking out the ones armed with Bensons in swift, terrible slashes,\ndodging spears and other missiles in midair, and roaring at the top of\nhis powerful lungs.\n\nAt last there were none with guns left to oppose him. He scythed down\nthe rest in two terrible, lightning sweeps of his ray, then dropped\nthe weapon from blistered fingers.\n\nHe was gasping for breath, and realized that he was losing air from\nthe seared-open right leg of his suit. He reached for the emergency\nkit at his side, drawing in great, gasping breaths, and fumbled out\na tube of sealing liquid. He spread the stuff on liberally, smearing\nit impartially over flesh and fabric. It felt like liquid hell on the\nburned, bleeding leg, but he kept on until the quick-drying fluid\nformed an airtight patch.\n\nOnly then did he turn, to see Tate flattened against the wall behind\nhim, his hands empty at his sides. \"I'm sorry,\" Tate said miserably. \"I\ncould have grabbed a spear or something, but--I just couldn't, not even\nto save my own life. I--I halfway hoped they'd kill both of us.\"\n\nSyme glared at him and spat, too enraged to think of diplomacy. He\nturned and strode out of the cavern, carrying his right leg stiffly,\nbut with his feral, tigerish head held high.\n\nHe led the way, wordlessly, back to the wrecked sand car. Tate followed\nhim with a hangdog, beaten air, as though he had just found something\nthat shattered all his previous concepts of the verities in life, and\ndidn't know what to do about it.\n\nStill silently, Syme refilled his oxygen tank, watched Tate do the\nsame, and then picked up two spare tanks and the precious black\nsuitcase and handed one of the tanks to Tate. Then he stumped around\nto the back of the car and inspected the damage. The cable reel, which\nmight have drawn them out of the gully, was hopelessly smashed. That\nwas that.\n\n\n\nThey started off down the canyon, Syme urging the slighter man to\na fast clip, even though his leg was already stiffening. When they\nfinally reached a climbable spot, Syme was limping badly and Tate was\nobviously exhausted.\n\nThey clambered wearily out onto the level sands again just as the\nsmall, blazing sun was setting. \"Luck,\" grunted Syme. \"Our only chance\nof getting near the city is at night.\" He peered around, shading his\neyes from the sun's glare with a gauntleted hand. \"See that?\"\n\nFollowing his pointing finger, Tate saw a faint, ephemeral arc showing\nabove a line of low hills in the distance. \"Kal-Jmar,\" said Syme.\n\nTate brightened a little. His body was too filled with fatigue for his\nmind to do any work on the problem that was baffling him, and so it\nreceded into the back of his mind.\n\n\"Kal-Jmar,\" whispered Syme again.\n\nThere was no twilight. The sun dropped abruptly behind the low horizon,\nand darkness fell, sudden and absolute. Syme picked up the extra oxygen\ntank and the suitcase, checked his direction by a wrist compass, and\nstarted toward the hills. Tate rose wearily to his feet and followed\nagain.\n\nTwo hours later, Kal-Jmar stood before them. They had wormed their\nway past the sentry posts, doing most of the last two hundred meters\non all fours. With skill and luck, and with Syme's fierce, burning\ndetermination, they had managed to escape detection--and there they\nwere. Journey's end.\n\nTate stared up at the shining, starlight towers in speechless\nadmiration. If the people who had built this city had been decadent,\nstill their architecture was magnificent. The city was a rhapsody made\nsolid. There was a sense of decay about it, he thought, but it was the\ndecay of supreme beauty, caught at the very verge of dissolution and\npreserved for all eternity.\n\n\"Well?\" demanded Syme.\n\nTate started, shaken out of his dream. He looked down at the black\nsuitcase, a little wonderingly, and then pulled it to him and opened it.\n\nInside, carefully wrapped in shock-absorbing tissue, was a fragile\ncontrivance of many tubes and wires, and a tiny parabolic mirror. It\nhad a brand new Elecorp 210 volt battery, and it needed every volt of\nthat tremendous power. Tate made the connections, his hands trembling\nslightly, and set it up on a telescoping tripod. Syme watched him\nclosely, his big body tensed with expectation.\n\nThe field was before them, shimmering faintly in the starlight. It\nlooked unsubstantial as the stuff of dreams, but both men knew that no\npower man possessed, unless it was the thing Tate held, could penetrate\nthat screen.\n\nTate set the mechanism up close to the field, aimed it very delicately,\nand closed a minute switch. After a long second, he opened it again.\n\nNothing happened.\n\nThe screen was still there, as unsubstantial and as solid as ever.\nThere was no change.\n\n\n\nTate looked worriedly at his wiring, a deep wrinkle appearing between\nhis pale, serious eyes. Syme stood stock-still but quivering with\nrepressed energy, scowling like a thundercloud.\n\n\"It must be capable of working,\" Tate told himself querulously. \"The\nMartians knew--they wouldn't have tried to stop us if--Wait a minute.\"\nHe paced back and forth, biting his lip. Syme watched him with catlike\neyes, clenching and unclenching his great fists.\n\nTate paused. \"I think I have it,\" he said slowly. \"I haven't enough\npower to hetrodyne the whole screen, although that's theoretically\npossible. But there must be weaker portions of the field--doors--set\nto open on the impact of a beam like this one. But I've only got power\nenough for two more tries. Jones, where would you put an entrance, if\nyou'd built Kal-Jmar?\"\n\nSyme's eyes widened, and he stared around slowly. \"A thousand years\nago?\" he muttered. \"Two thousand? These hills were raised in five\nhundred. We can't go by topography.\n\n\"In front of one of the main arteries, then. But there are dozens, no\none larger than the other. Did they have dozens of doors?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Tate. He pointed to the right, where the fairy towers of\nKal-Jmar swept aside to leave a broad avenue. \"It's the nearest--as\ngood as any other.\"\n\nThey walked over to it in silence, and in silence Tate set up his\nequipment once more. He shifted it from side to side, squinting, until\nhe had it lined up exactly on the center of the avenue. Then he took a\nlong breath, and closed the switch again.\n\nThe switch came up. Syme stared with fierce eagerness, eyes ablaze. For\na moment there was nothing, and then--\n\nTate clutched the big man's arm. \"Look!\" he breathed.\n\nWhere the ray from Tate's machine had impinged, a faintly-glowing\nspot of violet radiance! As they watched it widened, dilating into a\nperfect circle of violet, enclosing nothingness. The door was opening.\n\n\"It worked,\" Tate said softly. \"It worked!\"\n\nSyme shook off his grip impatiently, put his hand to the gun in the\nholster of his suit. Tate was still watching, fascinated. \"Look,\" he\nsaid again. \"The color is changing slightly, falling down the spectrum.\nI think that's a warning signal. When it reaches red, the door will\nclose.\" He moved toward the widening door, like a sleepwalker.\n\n\"Wait,\" Syme said hoarsely. \"You forgot the machine.\"\n\nTate turned, said, \"Oh yes,\" and walked back. Then he saw the gun in\nSyme's hand. His jaw dropped slightly, but he didn't say anything. He\njust stood there, looking dumbly from the gun to Syme's dark face.\n\nSyme shot him carefully in the chest.\n\nHe dropped like a rag doll, but Syme's aim had been bad. He wasn't dead\nyet. He rolled his eyes up, like a child. His lips moved. In spite of\nhimself, Syme bent forward to listen.\n\n\"_You'll be_--_sorry_,\" Tate said, and died.\n\nAir was sighing out through the widening hole in the screen. Syme\nstraightened and smiled tolerantly. For a moment, he had been\nunreasonably afraid of what Tate was about to say. Some detail he had\nforgotten, perhaps, something that would trap him now that Tate, the\nman who knew the answers, was dead. But--he'd be sorry!\n\nFor what? Another dead fool?\n\nHe gathered up the delicate mechanism in one arm, and, filling his deep\nlungs, stepped forward through the opening.\n\n\n\nThe towers of dead Kal-Jmar loomed over him in the dusk as he strode\nlike a conqueror down the long-deserted avenue. The city was full of\nthe whisperings of Kal-Jmar's ancient wraiths, but they touched only\na corner of his mind. He was filled to overflowing with the bright,\nglowing joy of conquest. The city was his!\n\nHis boots trod an avenue where no foot had fallen these untold eons,\nyet there was no dust. The city was bright and furbished waiting for\nhim. He was intoxicated. _The city was his!_\n\nThere was a gentle ramp leading upward, and Syme followed it, breathing\nin the manufactured air of his pressure suit like wine. All around him,\nthe city blazed with treasures beyond price.\n\n_It was his!_\n\nThe ramp led to a portal set in the side of a shining needle of a\nbuilding. Syme strode up to the threshold, and the door dilated for\nhim. He stepped inside; the door closed and a soft light glowed on.\n\nThere was air here: good, breathable air. A tiny zephyr of it was\nblowing from some hidden source against his body. Greatly daring, he\nunfastened the helmet of his suit and flung it back. He breathed in a\nlungful of it. God, but it was good after that canned stuff! It was a\nlittle heady; it made his head swim--but it was good air, excellent air!\n\nHe looked around him, measuring, assessing for the first time. This\nroom alone was worth a fortune. There was platinum; in ornaments, set\ninto the walls, in furniture. That would be enough to buy the little\nthings--a new ship, or perhaps even immunity back on Earth. But that\nwas as nothing to the rest of it, the things three worlds would clamor\nfor--the artifacts, the record books, the machines!\n\nHe strode about the room, building plan on grandiose plan. He could\ntake back only a little with him at first; but he could return again\nand again, with Tate's mechanism and new batteries. But he'd explore\nthe city thoroughly before he left. Somewhere there must be weapons. An\ninvincible weapon, perhaps, that a man could carry in his hand. Perhaps\neven a perfect body screen. With that he wouldn't have to steal away\nfrom Mars on a freighter, hiding his loot and his greatness in a dingy\nengine room. He could walk into a Triplanet ship and order its captain\nto take him wherever he chose to go!\n\n\n\nHe stood then in the middle of the room, arms akimbo, his head swimming\nwith glory--and remembered suddenly that he was hungry. He felt in the\ncontainer of his helmet, extracted a couple of food tablets, and popped\nthem into his mouth.\n\nThey would take care of his needs, but they didn't satisfy his hunger.\nNo food tablets for him after this! Steaks, wines, souffles.... His\nmouth began to water at the very thought.\n\nAnd then the robot rolled on soundless wheels into the room. Syme\nwhirled and saw it only when it was almost upon him. The thing was\nremarkably lifelike, and for a moment he was startled.\n\nBut it was not alive. It was only a Martian feeding-machine, kept in\nrepair all these millennia by other robots. It was not intelligent,\nand so it did not know that its masters would never return. It did not\nknow, either, that Syme was not a Martian, or that he wanted a steak,\nand not the distilled liquor of the _xopa_ fungus, which still grew in\nthe subterranean gardens of Kal-Jmar. It was capable only of receiving\nthe mental impulse of hunger, and of responding to that impulse.\n\nAnd so when Syme saw it and opened his mouth in startlement, the\nrobot acted as it had done with its degenerate, slothful masters. Its\nflexible feeding tube darted out and half down the man's gullet before\nhe could move to avoid it. And down Syme Rector's throat poured a flood\nof _xopa_-juice, nectar to Martians, but swift, terrible death to human\nbeings....\n\nOutside, the last doorway to Kal-Jmar closed forever, across from the\ncold body of Tate.",
