She keeps them white;\n   She guards them from the steep.\nShe feeds them on the fragrant height,\n   And folds them in for sleep.\n\nShe roams maternal hills and bright,\n   Dark valleys safe and deep.\nInto that tender breast at night\n   The chastest stars may peep.\nShe walks--the lady of my delight--\n   A shepherdess of sheep.\n\nShe holds her little thoughts in sight,\n   Though gay they run and leap.\nShe is so circumspect and right;\n   She has her soul to keep.\nShe walks--the lady of my delight--\n   A shepherdess of sheep.\n\n\n\n\n\"I AM THE WAY\"\n\n\n      Thou art the Way.\nHadst Thou been nothing but the goal,\n      I cannot say\nIf Thou hadst ever met my soul.\n\n      I cannot see--\nI, child of process--if there lies\n      An end for me,\nFull of repose, full of replies.\n\n      I'll not reproach\nThe way that goes, my feet that stir.\n      Access, approach,\nArt Thou, time, way, and wayfarer.\n\n\n\n\nVIA, ET VERITAS, ET VITA\n\n\n\"You never attained to Him?\"  \"If to attain\n   Be to abide, then that may be.\"\n\"Endless the way, followed with how much pain!\"\n      \"The way was He.\"\n\n\n\n\n\"WHY WILT THOU CHIDE?\"\n\n\n   Why wilt thou chide,\nWho hast attained to be denied?\n   Oh learn, above\nAll price is my refusal, Love.\n   My sacred Nay\nWas never cheapened by the way.\nThy single sorrow crowns thee lord\nOf an unpurchasable word.\n\n   Oh strong, Oh pure!\nAs Yea makes happier loves secure,\n   I vow thee this\nUnique rejection of a kiss.\n   I guard for thee\nThis jealous sad monopoly.\nI seal this honour thine.  None dare\nHope for a part in thy despair.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LADY POVERTY\n\n\nThe Lady Poverty was fair:\nBut she has lost her looks of late,\nWith change of times and change of air.\nAh slattern, she neglects her hair,\nHer gown, her shoes.  She keeps no state\nAs once when her pure feet were bare.\n\nOr--almost worse, if worse can be--\nShe scolds in parlours; dusts and trims,\nWatches and counts.  Oh, is this she\nWhom Francis met, whose step was free,\nWho with Obedience carolled hymns,\nIn Umbria walked with Chastity?\n\nWhere is her ladyhood?  Not here,\nNot among modern kinds of men;\nBut in the stony fields, where clear\nThrough the thin trees the skies appear;\nIn delicate spare soil and fen,\nAnd slender landscape and austere.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FOLD\n\n\n      Behold,\nThe time is now!  Bring back, bring back\nThy flocks of fancies, wild of whim.\nOh lead them from the mountain-track--\n      Thy frolic thoughts untold.\nOh bring them in--the fields grow dim--\n      And let me be the fold.\n\n      Behold,\nThe time is now!  Call in, O call\nThy posturing kisses gone astray\nFor scattered sweets.  Gather them all\n      To shelter from the cold.\nThrong them together, close and gay,\n      And let me be the fold!\n\n\n\n\nCRADLE-SONG AT TWILIGHT\n\n\nThe child not yet is lulled to rest.\n   Too young a nurse, the slender Night\nSo laxly holds him to her breast\n   That throbs with flight.\n\nHe plays with her and will not sleep.\n   For other playfellows she sighs;\nAn unmaternal fondness keep\n   Her alien eyes.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ROARING FROST\n\n\nA flock of winds came winging from the North,\nStrong birds with fighting pinions driving forth\n   With a resounding call!\n\nWhere will they close their wings and cease their cries--\nBetween what warming seas and conquering skies--\n   And fold, and fall?\n\n\n\n\nPARENTAGE\n\n\n   \"When Augustus Caesar legislated against the unmarried citizens of\n   Rome, he declared them to be, in some sort, slayers of the people.\"\n\n   Ah no, not these!\nThese, who were childless, are not they who gave\nSo many dead unto the journeying wave,\nThe helpless nurslings of the cradling seas;\nNot they who doomed by infallible decrees\nUnnumbered man to the innumerable grave.\n\n   But those who slay\nAre fathers.  Theirs are armies.  Death is theirs,\nThe death of innocences and despairs;\nThe dying of the golden and the grey.\nThe sentence, when these speak it, has no Nay.\nAnd she who slays is she who bears, who bears.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MODERN MOTHER\n\n\n   Oh what a kiss\nWith filial passion overcharged is this!\n   To this misgiving breast\nThe child runs, as a child ne'er ran to rest\nUpon the light heart and the unoppressed.\n\n   Unhoped, unsought!\nA little tenderness, this mother thought\n   The utmost of her meed\nShe looked for gratitude; content indeed\nWith thus much that her nine years' love had bought.\n\n   Nay, even with less.\nThis mother, giver of life, death, peace, distress,\n   Desired ah! not so much\nThanks as forgiveness; and the passing touch\nExpected, and the slight, the brief caress.\n\n   Oh filial light\nStrong in these childish eyes, these new, these bright\n   Intelligible stars!  Their rays\nAre near the constant earth, guides in the maze,\nNatural, true, keen in this dusk of days.\n\n\n\n\nWEST WIND IN WINTER\n\n\nAnother day awakes.  And who--\n   Changing the world--is this?\nHe comes at whiles, the Winter through,\n   West Wind!  I would not miss\nHis sudden tryst: the long, the new\n   Surprises of his kiss.\n\nVigilant, I make haste to close\n   With him who comes my way.\nI go to meet him as he goes;\n   I know his note, his lay,\nHis colour and his morning rose;\n   And I confess his day.\n\nMy window waits; at dawn I hark\n   His call; at morn I meet\nHis haste around the tossing park\n   And down the softened street;\nThe gentler light is his; the dark,\n   The grey--he turns it sweet.\n\nSo too, so too, do I confess\n   My poet when he sings.\nHe rushes on my mortal guess\n   With his immortal things.\nI feel, I know him.  On I press--\n   He finds me 'twixt his wings.\n\n\n\n\nNOVEMBER BLUE\n\n\n   _The colour of the electric lights has a strange effect in giving a\n   complementary tint to the air in the early evening_.--ESSAY ON LONDON.\n\nO, Heavenly colour!  London town\n   Has blurred it from her skies;\nAnd hooded in an earthly brown,\n   Unheaven'd the city lies.\nNo longer standard-like this hue\n   Above the broad road flies;\nNor does the narrow street the blue\n   Wear, slender pennon-wise.\n\nBut when the gold and silver lamps\n   Colour the London dew,\nAnd, misted by the winter damps,\n   The shops shine bright anew--\nBlue comes to earth, it walks the street,\n   It dyes the wide air through;\nA mimic sky about their feet,\n   The throng go crowned with blue.\n\n\n\n\nCHIMES\n\n\nBrief, on a flying night,\nFrom the shaken tower,\nA flock of bells take flight,\nAnd go with the hour.\n\nLike birds from the cote to the gales,\nAbrupt--O hark!\nA fleet of bells set sails,\nAnd go to the dark.\n\nSudden the cold airs swing.\nAlone, aloud,\nA verse of bells takes wing\nAnd flies with the cloud.\n\n\n\n\nUNTO US A SON IS GIVEN\n\n\n      Given, not lent,\n   And not withdrawn--once sent--\nThis Infant of mankind, this One,\nIs still the little welcome Son.\n\n      New every year,\n   New-born and newly dear,\nHe comes with tidings and a song,\nThe ages long, the ages long.\n\n      Even as the cold\n   Keen winter grows not old;\nAs childhood is so fresh, foreseen,\nAnd spring in the familiar green;\n\n      Sudden as sweet\n   Come the expected feet.\nAll joy is young, and new all art,\nAnd He, too, Whom we have by heart.\n\n\n\n\nA DEAD HARVEST\n[IN KENSINGTON GARDENS]\n\n\nAlong the graceless grass of town\nThey rake the rows of red and brown,\nDead leaves, unlike the rows of hay,\nDelicate, neither gold nor grey,\nRaked long ago and far away.\n\nA narrow silence in the park;\nBetween the lights a narrow dark.\nOne street rolls on the north, and one,\nMuffled, upon the south doth run.\nAmid the mist the work is done.\n\nA futile crop; for it the fire\nSmoulders, and, for a stack, a pyre.\nSo go the town's lives on the breeze,\nEven as the sheddings of the trees;\nBosom nor barn is filled with these.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TWO POETS\n\n\n      Whose is the speech\nThat moves the voices of this lonely beech?\nOut of the long West did this wild wind come--\nOh strong and silent!  And the tree was dumb,\n      Ready and dumb, until\nThe dumb gale struck it on the darkened hill.\n\n      Two memories,\nTwo powers, two promises, two silences\nClosed in this cry, closed in these thousand leaves\nArticulate.  This sudden hour retrieves\n      The purpose of the past,\nSeparate, apart--embraced, embraced at last.\n\n      \"Whose is the word?\nIs it I that spake?  Is it thou?  Is it I that heard?\"\n\"Thine earth was solitary; yet I found thee!\"\n\"Thy sky was pathless, but I caught, I bound thee,\n      Thou visitant divine.\"\n\"O thou my Voice, the word was thine.\"\n   \"Was thine.\"\n\n\n\n\nA POET'S WIFE\n\n\nI saw a tract of ocean locked in-land\n   Within a field's embrace--\nThe very sea!  Afar it fled the strand\n   And gave the seasons chase,\nAnd met the night alone, the tempest spanned,\n   Saw sunrise face to face.\n\nO Poet, more than ocean, lonelier!\n   In inaccessible rest\nAnd storm remote, thou, sea of thoughts, dost stir,\n   Scattered through east to west,--\nNow, while thou closest with the kiss of her\n   Who locks thee to her breast.\n\n\n\n\nVENERATION OF IMAGES\n\n\nThou man, first-comer, whose wide arms entreat,\n   Gather, clasp, welcome, bind,\nLack, or remember! whose warm pulses beat\n   With love of thine own kind;\n\nUnlifted for a blessing on yon sea,\n   Unshrined on this high-way,\nO flesh, O grief, thou too shalt have our knee,\n   Thou rood of every day!\n\n\n\n\nAT NIGHT\n\n\nHome, home from the horizon far and clear,\n      Hither the soft wings sweep;\nFlocks of the memories of the day draw near\n      The dovecote doors of sleep.\n\nO which are they that come through sweetest light\n      Of all these homing birds?\nWhich with the straightest and the swiftest flight?\n      Your words to me, your words!",
