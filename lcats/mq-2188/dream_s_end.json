    "body": "The sanitarium was never quiet. Even when night brought comparative\nstillness, there was an anticipatory tension in the air\u2014for cyclic\nmental disorders are as inevitable, though not as regular, as the swing\nof a merry-go-round.\n\nEarlier that evening Gregson, in Ward 13, had moved into the downswing\nof his manic-depressive curve, and there had been trouble. Before the\norderlies could buckle him into a restraining jacket, he had managed to\nbreak the arm of a \u201cfrozen\u201d catatonic patient, who had made no sound\neven as the bone snapped.\n\nUnder apomorphine, Gregson subsided. After a few days he would be at the\nbottom of his psychic curve, dumb, motionless, and disinterested.\nNothing would be able to rouse him then, for a while.\n\nDr. Robert Bruno, Chief of Staff, waited till the nurse had gone out\nwith the no longer sterile hypodermic. Then he nodded at the orderly.\n\n\u201cAll right. Prepare the patient. I want him in Surgery Three in half an\nhour.\u201d\n\nHe went out into the corridor, a tall, quiet man with cool blue eyes and\nfirm lips. Dr. Kenneth Morrissey was waiting for him. The younger man\nlooked troubled.\n\n\u201cSurgery, Doctor?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Bruno said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get ready. How\u2019s Wheeler?\u201d\n\n\u201cSimple fracture of the radius, I think. I\u2019m having plates made.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurn him over to one of the other doctors,\u201d Bruno suggested. \u201cI need\nyour help.\u201d He used his key on the locked door. \u201cGregson\u2019s in good shape\nfor the experiment.\u201d\n\nMorrissey didn\u2019t answer. Bruno laughed a little.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s bothering you, Ken?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the word experiment,\u201d Morrissey said.\n\n\u201cPentothal narcosynthesis was an experiment when they first tried it. So\nis this\u2014empathy surrogate. If there\u2019s a risk, I\u2019ll be taking it, not\nGregson.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be sure.\u201d\n\nThey stepped into the elevator.\n\n\u201cI _am_ sure,\u201d Bruno said, with odd emphasis. \u201cThat\u2019s been my rule all\nmy life. I make sure. I\u2019ve got to _be_ sure before I undertake anything\nnew. This experiment can\u2019t possibly fail. I don\u2019t run risks with\npatients.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCome in here.\u201d Bruno led the way from the elevator to an examination\nroom. \u201cI want a final check-up. Try my blood-pressure.\u201d He stripped off\nhis white coat and deftly wound the pneumatic rubber around his arm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve explained the whole situation to Gregson\u2019s wife.\u201d Bruno went on as\nMorrissey squeezed the bulb. \u201cShe\u2019s signed the authorization papers. She\nknows it\u2019s the only chance to cure Gregson. After all, Ken, the man\u2019s\nbeen insane for seven years. Cerebral deterioration\u2019s beginning to set\nin.\u201d\n\n\u201cCellular, you mean? Um-m. I\u2019m not worried about that. Blood-pressure\nokay. Heart\u2014\u201d\n\nMorrissey picked up a stethoscope. After a while he nodded.\n\n\u201cA physician hasn\u2019t any right to be afraid of the dark,\u201d Bruno said.\n\n\u201cA physician isn\u2019t charting unmapped territory,\u201d Morrissey said\nabruptly. \u201cYou can dissect a cadaver, but you can\u2019t do that to the\npsyche. As a psychiatrist you should be the first to admit that we don\u2019t\nknow all there is to know about the mind. Would you take a transfusion\nfrom a meningitis patient?\u201d\n\nBruno chuckled. \u201cWitchcraft, Ken\u2014pure witchcraft! The germ theory of\npsychosis! Afraid I\u2019ll catch Gregson\u2019s insanity? I hate to disillusion\nyou, but episodic disorders aren\u2019t contagious.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust because you can\u2019t see a bug doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t there,\u201d\nMorrissey growled. \u201cWhat about a filterable virus? A few years ago\nnobody could conceive of liquid life.\u201d\n\n\u201cNext you\u2019ll be going back to Elizabethan times and talking about spleen\nand humors.\u201d Bruno resumed his shirt and coat. He sobered. \u201cIn a way,\nthough, this _is_ a transfusion. The only type of transfusion possible.\nI\u2019ll admit no one knows all there is to know about psychoses. Nobody\nknows what makes a man think, either. But that\u2019s where physics is\nbeginning to meet medicine. Witchcraft and medicine isolated digitalin\nwhen they met. And scientists are beginning to know the nature of\nthought\u2014an electronic pattern of energy.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmpirical!\u201d\n\n\u201cCompare not the brain, but the mind itself, to a uranium pile,\u201d Bruno\nsaid. \u201cThe potentialities for atomic explosion are in the mind because\nyou can\u2019t make a high-specialized colloid for thinking without\napproaching the danger level. It\u2019s the price humans pay for being _homo\nsapiens_. In a uranium pile you\u2019ve got boron-steel bars as dampers, to\nabsorb the neutrons before they can get out of control. In the mind,\nthose dampers are purely psychic, naturally\u2014but they\u2019re what keep a man\nsane.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can prove anything by symbolism,\u201d Morrissey said sourly. \u201cAnd you\ncan\u2019t stick bars of boron-steel in Gregson\u2019s skull.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I can,\u201d Bruno said. \u201cIn effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut those dampers are\u2014_ideas_! Thoughts! You can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is a thought?\u201d Bruno asked.\n\nMorrissey grimaced and followed the Chief of Staff out.\n\n\u201cYou can chart a thought on the encephalograph\u2014\u201d he said stubbornly.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s a radiation. What causes that radiation? Energy emitted by\ncertain electronic patterns. What causes electronic patterns? The basic\nphysical structure of matter. What causes uranium to throw off neutrons\nunder special conditions? Same answer. If an uranium pile starts to get\nout of control, you can damp it, if you move fast, with boron or\ncadmium.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you move fast. Why use Gregson? He\u2019s been insane for years.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019d been insane for only a week, we couldn\u2019t prove it was the\nempathy surrogate that cured him. You\u2019re just arguing to dodge the\nresponsibility. If you don\u2019t want to help me, I\u2019ll get somebody else.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would take weeks to train another man,\u201d Morrissey said. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll\noperate. Only\u2014have you thought of the possible effect on your own\nmind?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d Bruno said. \u201cWhy the devil do you suppose I\u2019ve been running\nexhaustive psychological tests on myself? I\u2019m completely oriented, I\u2019m\nso normal that my mind must be full of boron dampers.\u201d He paused at the\ndoor of his office. \u201cBarbara\u2019s here. I\u2019ll meet you in Surgery.\u201d\n\nMorrissey\u2019s shoulders slumped. Bruno smiled slightly and opened the\ndoor. His wife was sitting on a leather couch, idly turning the pages of\na psychiatric review.\n\n\u201cStudying?\u201d Bruno said. \u201cWant a job as a nurse?\u201d\n\n\u201cHello, darling,\u201d she said, tossing the magazine aside.\n\nShe came toward him quickly. She was small and dark and, Bruno thought\nacademically, extremely pretty. Then his thoughts stopped being academic\nas he kissed her.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing that operation tonight, aren\u2019t you? I wanted to wish you\nluck.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cBob,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019ve been married long enough so I can read your mind\na little. I don\u2019t know what the operation is, but I know it\u2019s important.\nSo\u2014for luck!\u201d\n\nShe kissed him again. Then, with a smile and a nod, she slipped out and\nwas gone. Dr. Robert Bruno sighed, not unhappily, and sat behind his\ndesk. He used the annunciator to check the sanitarium\u2019s routine, made\ncertain everything was running smoothly, and clicked his tongue with\nsatisfaction.\n\nNow\u2014the experiment....\n\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n\nSurgery Three had some new equipment for the experiment. Bruno\u2019s\ncollaborator, Andrew Parsons, the atomic physicist, was there, small and\nuntidy, with a scowling, wrinkled face that looked incongruous under the\nsurgeon\u2019s cap. There was to be no real surgery; trepanning wasn\u2019t\nnecessary, but aseptic precautions were taken as a matter of course.\n\nThe anesthetist and two other nurses stood ready, and Morrissey, in his\nwhite gown, seemed to have forgotten his worry and had settled down to\nhis usual quiet competence. Gregson was on one of the tables, already\nprepped and unconscious. Intravenous anesthesia would presently\nsupplement the apomorphine in his system, as it would also be\nadministered to Bruno himself.\n\nFerguson and Dale, two other doctors, were present. At worst quick\ncerebral surgery might be necessary, if anything went badly amiss. But\nnothing could, Bruno thought. Nothing could.\n\nHe glanced at the sleek, shining machines, with their attachments and\nregistering dials. Not medical equipment, of course. They were in\nParsons\u2019 line; he had planned and built them. But the idea had been\nBruno\u2019s to begin with, and Bruno\u2019s psychiatric knowledge had\ncomplemented Parsons\u2019 technology. Two branches of science had met, and\nthe result would be\u2014a specific for insanity.\n\nTwo spots on Bruno\u2019s head had been shaved clean. Parsons carefully\naffixed electrodes, which were already in place on Gregson\u2019s skull.\n\n\u201cRemember,\u201d Parsons said, \u201cyou should be as relaxed as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou took no sedative, Doctor,\u201d Morrissey said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need one. The anesthetic will be enough.\u201d\n\nThe nurses moved with silent competence about the table. The emergency\noxygen apparatus was tested. The adrenalin was checked; the sterilizer\nsteamed on its table. Bruno emptied his mind and relaxed as a nurse\nswabbed his arm with alcohol.\n\nSuperimposure of the electronic mental matrix of sanity ... psychic\nrapport ... the pattern of his sanity-dampers would be fixed\nunalterably in the twisted, warped mind of the manic-depressive.\n\nHe felt the sting of the needle. Automatically he began counting. One.\nTwo. Three....\n\nHe opened his eyes. The face of Morrissey, intent and abstracted, hung\nover him. Beyond Morrissey was the bright ceiling fluorescent, glaring\ndown with a brilliance that made Bruno blink. His arm stung slightly but\notherwise there were no after effects.\n\n\u201cCan you hear me, Doctor?\u201d Morrissey said.\n\nBruno nodded. \u201cYes. I\u2019m awake now.\u201d His tongue was a little thick. That\nwas natural. \u201cGregson?\u201d\n\nBut Morrissey\u2019s face was growing smaller. No, it was receding. The\nceiling light shrank. _He was falling_\u2014\n\nHe shot down with blinding rapidity. White walls rushed up past him.\nMorrissey\u2019s face receded to a shining dot far above. It grew darker as\nhe fell. Winds screamed, and there was a slow, gradually increasing\nthundering like an echo resounding from the floor of this monstrous\nabyss.\n\nDown and down, faster and faster, with the white walls fading to gray\nand to black, till he was blind, till he was deafened with that roaring\necho.\n\nVisibility returned. Everything was out of focus. He blinked, swallowed,\nand made out the rectangular shape of a bedside screen. There was\nsomething else, white and irregular.\n\n\u201cAre you awake, Doctor?\u201d\n\n\u201cHello, Harwood,\u201d Bruno said to the nurse. \u201cHow long have I been out?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout two hours. I\u2019ll call Dr. Morrissey.\u201d\n\nShe stepped out of the room. Bruno flexed his muscles experimentally. He\nfelt all right. Not even a headache. His vision was normal now. He\ninstinctively reached for his wrist and began counting the pulse.\nThrough the window he could see the slow motion of a branch, the leaves\nfluttering in a gentle wind. Footsteps sounded.\n\n\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Morrissey said, coming to the bed. \u201cGregson\u2019s in\nshock, but he\u2019s already beginning to come out of it. No prognosis yet,\nbut I\u2019ll bet a cookie you\u2019ve done it.\u201d\n\nBruno let out his breath in a long sigh. \u201cYou think so?\u201d\n\nMorrissey laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you weren\u2019t sure!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always sure,\u201d Bruno said. \u201cJust the same, confirmation\u2019s always\npleasant. I\u2019m thirsty as the devil. Get me some ice, Ken, will you?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right.\u201d Morrissey leaned out of the door and called the nurse. Then\nhe came back and lowered the Venetian blind. \u201cSun in your eyes. That\nbetter? How do you feel, or need I ask?\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite normal. No ill effects at all. Say, you\u2019d better notify Barbara\nI\u2019m alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI already have. She\u2019s coming over. Meanwhile, Parsons is outside. Want\nto see him?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n\nThe physicist must have been near the door, for he appeared almost\ninstantly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to depend on you now,\u201d he said. \u201cPsychiatric examinations are\nout of my line, but Dr. Morrissey tells me we\u2019ve apparently succeeded.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be sure yet,\u201d Bruno said cautiously, reaching for cracked ice.\n\u201cI\u2019m keeping my fingers crossed.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a healthier specimen in this hospital than Dr. Bruno,\u201d\nMorrissey said, \u201cI\u2019ve yet to hear of it. I\u2019ll be back. I\u2019ve got to check\na patient.\u201d He went out.\n\nBruno lay back on his pillow.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be up and around tomorrow,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ll want to make some\ntests on Gregson then. Meanwhile, I\u2019ll relax\u2014for a change. One good\nthing about this place; the routine\u2019s so perfect that you can unhitch\nyourself completely and let yourself rest, if you want to. A dependable\nstaff.\u201d\n\nThe Venetian blind clattered in the wind. Parsons grunted and went\ntoward it, taking hold of the cord.\n\nHe raised the blind and stood there, his back to Bruno. But it was dark\noutside the window.\n\n\u201cThe sun was in my eyes,\u201d Bruno said. \u201cWait a minute! That was only a\nlittle while ago. Parsons, something\u2019s wrong!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Parsons asked, without turning.\n\n\u201cMorrissey said I was unconscious for only two hours. And I took\nanesthesia at half-past nine. At night! But the sun was shining in that\nwindow when I woke up, a few minutes ago!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s night now,\u201d Parsons said.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be. Get Morrissey. I want to\u2014\u201d\n\nBut Parsons suddenly leaned forward and opened the window. Then he\njumped out and vanished.\n\n\u201c_Morrissey!_\u201d Bruno shouted.\n\nMorrissey came in. He didn\u2019t look at Bruno. He walked quickly across the\nroom and jumped out of the window into the darkness.\n\nFerguson and Dale entered, still in their operating gowns. They followed\nMorrissey through the window.\n\nBruno hoisted himself up. Three nurses came through the door. An intern\nand an orderly followed. Then others.\n\nIn nightmare procession the staff filed into Bruno\u2019s room. In deadly\nsilence they walked to the window and jumped out.\n\nThe blankets slipped down from Bruno\u2019s body. He saw them sail slowly\ntoward the window\u2014\n\nThe bed was tilting! No\u2014the room itself was turning, revolving, till\nBruno clung frantically to the head-board while gravity dragged him\ninexorably toward a window that now gaped directly below him.\n\nThe bed fell. It spilled Bruno out. He saw the oblong of the window\nopening like a mouth to swallow him. He plunged through into utter\nblackness, into an echoing, roaring hell of night and thunder....\n\n\u201cOh, good heavens!\u201d Bruno moaned. \u201cWhat a dream! Morrissey, get me a\nsedative!\u201d\n\nThe psychiatrist laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a dream-within-a-dream before,\nhaven\u2019t you, Doctor? It sounds unnerving, but now you\u2019ve told me all\nabout it. The catharsis is better than a barbiturate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose so.\u201d Bruno lay back in the bed.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the room he had dreamed about. It was much larger, and\noutside the windows was normal darkness. Morrissey had said that the\nanesthetic had lasted for several hours.\n\n\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m jittery,\u201d Bruno said.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had any nerves.... Here, Harwood.\u201d Morrissey\nturned to the nurse and scribbled down a few symbols on a pad. \u201cThere.\nWe\u2019ll get your sedative. Don\u2019t you want to know about Gregson?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d forgotten about him completely,\u201d Bruno acknowledged. \u201cCan you tell\nanything definite yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe caught him on the downcurve of the depressive cycle, remember? Well,\nhe isn\u2019t talking yet, but there\u2019s a touch of euphoria. The elation will\nwear off. One thing, you\u2019ve broken the cycle. His mind isn\u2019t adjusted\nyet to those\u2014damper bars you put in \u2019em, but off-hand, I\u2019d say it looks\npretty good.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does Parsons think?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s immersed in calculations. Said he\u2019d be around to see you as soon\nas you woke up. Here\u2019s that sedative.\u201d\n\nBruno accepted the capsules from the nurse and washed them down with\nwater.\n\n\u201cThanks. I\u2019d rather rest a bit. I must have unconsciously piled up quite\na lot of tension.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I gather,\u201d Morrissey said drily. \u201cWell, here\u2019s the bell-cord.\nAnything else?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust rest.\u201d Bruno hesitated. \u201cOh\u2014one thing.\u201d He extended his arm.\n\u201cPinch it.\u201d\n\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n\nMorrissey stared and chuckled.\n\n\u201cStill not sure you\u2019re awake? I can assure you you are, Doctor. I\u2019m not\ngoing to jump out of the window. And it\u2019s still night, you\u2019ll notice.\u201d\n\nWhen Bruno didn\u2019t move, Morrissey pinched up a fold of the other\u2019s\nforearm between thumb and finger.\n\n\u201cOuch!\u201d Bruno said. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny time,\u201d Morrissey said cheerfully. \u201cGet some rest now. I\u2019ll be\nback.\u201d\n\nHe went out with the nurse. Bruno blew out his breath and let his gaze\nwander around the room. Everything looked perfectly solid and normal. No\nblack, thundering abyss lurked under the floor. An unpleasant dream!\n\nHe reached for pad and pencil and made careful notes on the curious\ndouble-delusion before he let himself relax. Then he felt the sedative\ncreeping slowly along his nerves, a warm, pleasant sensation that he was\nglad to encourage. He didn\u2019t want to think. Later would be time enough.\nThe empathy surrogate experiment, Gregson, the physicist Parsons,\nBarbara\u2014later!\n\nHe drowsed. It seemed only a moment before he opened his eyes to see\nsunlight beyond the window. Brief panic touched him, then he looked at\nhis wrist-watch and was reassured to see that it said eleven o\u2019clock. He\ncould hear the muffled sounds of the ordinary hospital routine going on\noutside door and window. Presently, feeling refreshed, he got up and\ndressed.\n\nIn Nurse Harwood\u2019s office he telephoned Morrissey, exchanged brief\ngreetings, and then went to his own office to shower and shave.\n\nHe telephoned Barbara.\n\n\u201cHello, there,\u201d she said. \u201cMorrissey notified me you were doing all\nright. So I thought I\u2019d wait till you woke up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m awake now. Suppose I come over to the house for lunch?\u201d\n\n\u201cSwell. I\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cHalf an hour, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cHalf an hour. I\u2019m glad you called, Bob. I was worried.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t have been.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas your experiment a success?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t tell yet. Keep your fingers crossed.\u201d\n\nTen minutes later Bruno\u2019s fingers were still crossed as he examined\nGregson. Parsons and Morrissey were present. The physicist kept making\nnotes, but Morrissey stood silent and watchful.\n\nThere was very little to be seen as yet. Gregson lay in his bed, the\nshaved spots on his head white against the dark hair, his features\nrelaxed and peaceful. The typical anxiety expression was gone. Bruno\nopened the man\u2019s eyes and flashed his light into them. Contraction of\nthe pupils seemed normal.\n\n\u201cCan you hear me, Gregson?\u201d\n\nGregson\u2019s lips moved. But he said nothing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right. You\u2019re feeling fine, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re not worried\nabout anything, are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cHeadache,\u201d Gregson said. \u201cBad headache.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll give you something for that. Now try to sleep.\u201d\n\nOutside, in the corridor, Bruno tried hard to repress his exultation.\nParsons blinked at him, scowling.\n\n\u201cCan you tell anything yet?\u201d\n\nBruno checked himself. \u201cNo. It\u2019s too soon. But\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe manic-depressive phase is passed,\u201d Morrissey put in. \u201cHe seems\nrational. And he hasn\u2019t been for three years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose damper bars\u2014\u201d Bruno smiled. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll have to wait and see.\nWe can\u2019t write up a report yet. He\u2019s certainly oriented. We\u2019ll give him\na chance to rest. More tests later. I don\u2019t want to jump the gun.\u201d\n\nBut with Barbara he let himself be more enthusiastic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done it, Barbara! Found a specific for insanity.\u201d\n\nShe leaned across the table to pour coffee.\n\n\u201cI thought there were so many types of psychosis that the treatment\nvaried considerably.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s true, but we\u2019ve never got to the real basis of the trouble\nbefore. You can cure a cold by rest therapy, force fluids and aspirin,\nbut cold vaccine gets directly to the root of the trouble. Some types of\ninsanity have been thought incurable, but tetanus was incurable till we\ngot a vaccine for it. The empathy surrogate therapy is the lowest common\ndenominator. It works on the electronic structure of the mind, and\nunless there\u2019s physical deterioration, as in advanced paresis, our\ntreatment should work beautifully.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what you were working on,\u201d Barbara said. \u201cBob, you don\u2019t know\nhow glad I am that it\u2019s successful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2014we hope. We\u2019re almost sure. But\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can take a vacation now? You\u2019ve been working so hard!\u201d\n\n\u201cA few more weeks, and I\u2019ll be ready. I\u2019ve got to collate my notes. I\ncan\u2019t run out on Parsons at this stage. But very soon, I promise.\u201d\n\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n\nHe looked up to see her smile. Suddenly he stiffened. Her smile was\nbroadening, stretching, the lower lip dropping till all her teeth\nshowed. The lower lids of her eyes hung ... stretched....\n\nHer nose lengthened.\n\nHer eyes slowly crawled out of their sockets and lengthened on dreadful\nstalks down her cheeks.\n\nShe melted down and out of sight beneath the table.\n\nThe table began to sink.\n\nAnd now everything around him was melting. Under him the chair became\nplastic and then fluid. The floor was a bowl, and the walls were\ndripping down into it, into a shining whirlpool at the center.\n\nHe slipped helplessly along that slope till the pool engulfed him, in a\nchaos of thunder and confusion and sickening horror.\n\nThe winds bellowed.... The empty drop closed around him.... He\nfell in darkness....\n\nThis time, when he woke, he wasn\u2019t sure. The panic had not left him. He\nlearned, later, that he had been semi-delirious for eight days, and only\nMorrissey\u2019s unceasing attention had kept him reasonably quiet. Then\nthere were weeks of convalescence, and a vacation, and it seemed a long\ntime before he came back from Florida, tanned and healthy, to resume his\nduties.\n\nEven then, though, there was the fear.\n\nWhen he drove toward the blocky buildings of the sanitarium he felt a\ntouch of it brush him. He reached for Barbara\u2019s hand, and felt some\ncomfort in the assurance of her nearness. She had been helpful, too,\nthough she had not understood.\n\nEvery day after that, when he left her, there was a fleeting\napprehension lest he never see her again. To forget the uncertainty of\nhis footing, the ground that was no longer absolutely solid, he plunged\ninto the hospital\u2019s routine. And gradually, after more weeks, the terror\nbegan to leave him.\n\nGregson had been cured. He was still under precautionary observation,\nbut all traces of his psychosis seemed to have vanished. There were\nstill minor neuroses, the natural result of the past six years of\nabnormal restraint, but they were disappearing under proper therapy. The\nempathy surrogate treatment was successful. Yet, for a while, Bruno\nrefused to attempt more experiments.\n\nParsons was displeased. He was anxious to chart a graph on the process,\nand one trial did not provide enough evidence. Bruno kept putting the\nphysicist off with promises. It eventually ended in a minor spat which\nMorrissey halted by pointing out that Dr. Robert Bruno was, technically,\nhis own patient, and was not yet ready for further research on the\ndangerous subject.\n\nParsons, furious, went off. Bruno followed Morrissey into the latter\u2019s\noffice and sat down in one of the more comfortable chairs. It was\nmid-afternoon, and beyond the windows the drowsy hum of summer made a\npeaceful counterpoint to the conversation.\n\n\u201cCigarette, Ken?\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks.... Look, Bob.\u201d The two men had drawn closer together in the\nlast weeks. Morrissey no longer addressed his Chief of Staff with the\nformer \u201cDoctor.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been collating the facts of your case, and I\nthink I\u2019ve got at the root of the trouble. Do you want to hear my\ndiagnosis?\u201d\n\n\u201cCandidly, I don\u2019t,\u201d Bruno said, closing his eyes and inhaling smoke.\n\u201cI\u2019d prefer to forget it. But I know I can\u2019t. That would be psychically\nruinous.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou had a cyclic self-containing dream\u2014I suppose you could call it\nthat. You dreamed you were dreaming you were dreaming. You know what\nyour trouble is?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not sure you\u2019re awake now.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure enough,\u201d Bruno said. \u201cMost of the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be sure all the time. Or else make yourself believe that\nit doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re dreaming or waking.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter! Ken! To know that everything may melt away under my\nfeet at any time, and to think that doesn\u2019t matter! That\u2019s impossible!\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019ve got to be sure you\u2019re awake. Those hallucinations you had\nare over. Weeks have passed.\u201d\n\n\u201cHallucinatory time is elastic and subjective.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a defense mechanism\u2014you know that, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cDefense against what?\u201d\n\nMorrissey moistened his lips. \u201cRemember, I\u2019m the psychiatrist and you\u2019re\nthe patient. You were psychoanalyzed when you studied psychiatry, but\nyou didn\u2019t get all the devils out of your subconscious. Hang it, Bob,\nyou know very well that most psychiatrists take up the work because\nthey\u2019re attracted to it for pathological reasons\u2014neuroses of their own.\nWhy did you always insist that you were so utterly sure of everything?\u201d\n\n\u201cI always made sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompensation. To allow for a basic unsureness and insecurity in your\nown makeup. Consciously you were sure the empathy surrogate treatment\nwould work, but your unconscious mind wasn\u2019t so certain. You never let\nyourself know that, though. But it came out under stress\u2014the therapy\nitself.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo on,\u201d Bruno said slowly.\n\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n\nMorrissey tapped the papers on his desk.\n\n\u201cI know my diagnosis is pretty accurate, but you can decide that for\nyourself. You can tell, perhaps, better than I can. The frontiers of the\nmind are _terra incognita_. Your simile of a uranium pile was better\nthan you\u2019d realized. When critical mass is approached, there\u2019s danger.\nAnd the damper bars in your own mind\u2014what did Parsons\u2019 machine do to\nthem?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am quite sane,\u201d Bruno said. \u201cI think.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure you are, now. You\u2019re getting over that explosion. You\u2019d been\nbuilding up an anxiety neurosis, and the therapy made it blow off. Just\nhow, I don\u2019t understand. The electronic patterns of the mind aren\u2019t in\nmy field. All I know is that the experiment with Gregson removed the\nsafety blocks from your mind, and you lost control for a while. Thus the\nhallucinations, which simply followed the path of least resistance.\nPoint One: You\u2019re afraid of insecurity and unsureness, and you always\nhave been. Thus your dream follows a familiarly symbolic pattern. At any\ntime the sureness of waking may vanish. Point Two: As long as you think\nyou\u2019re dreaming, you\u2019re dodging responsibility!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood Lord, Ken!\u201d Bruno said. \u201cI just want to be sure I\u2019m awake!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s absolutely no way you can be sure of that,\u201d Morrissey said.\n\u201cThe conviction must come from your own mind and be subjective. No\nobjective proof is possible. Otherwise, if you fail to convince\nyourself, the anxiety neurosis will grow back into a psychosis, and\u2014\u201d\nHe shrugged.\n\n\u201cIt sounds logical,\u201d Bruno said. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to see it pretty\nclearly. I think, perhaps, this clarification is what I needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think you\u2019re dreaming now?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at the moment\u2014certainly.\u201d\n\n\u201cSwell,\u201d Morrissey said. \u201cBecause the conglobulation of the psych\nbetween the forever and upstriding kaleeno bystixing forinder saan\u2014\u201d\n\nBruno jumped up. \u201cKen!\u201d he said, dry-throated. \u201cStop it!\u201d\n\n\u201cFylixar catween baleeza\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c_Stop it!_\u201d\n\n\u201cBYZINDERKONA REPSTILLING AND ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS NEVER KNOWING NEVER\nKNOWING NEVER KNOWING\u2014\u201d\n\nThe words came out in great whirling shining globes. They raced past\nBruno\u2019s head with a screaming hiss. They bombarded him. They carried him\nback into a thundering, windy abyss of blackness and terror.\n\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n\nMorrissey stepped back from the bed and asked:\n\nDr. Robert Bruno managed to nod.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Morrissey said. \u201cYou were out for about three hours. But\neverything\u2019s going nicely. You\u2019ll be up and around pretty soon. There\u2019s\nplenty to be done. Barbara wants to see you\u2014and Parsons.\u201d\n\n\u201cKen,\u201d Bruno said, \u201cwait a minute. Am I awake now? I mean, really\nawake?\u201d\n\nMorrissey stared and grinned.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cI can guarantee that.\u201d\n\nBut Bruno did not answer. His gaze moved to the windows, to the solidity\nof the walls and ceiling, to the reality of his own hands and arms.\n\n_Never knowing?_\n\nHe looked at Morrissey, waiting for Morrissey to vanish, and the black\npit to open again beneath him.",
