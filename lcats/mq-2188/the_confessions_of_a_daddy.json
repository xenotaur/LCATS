OUR NEIGHBORS' BABIES\n\nI guess we folks that live up at our end of town think we are about as\ngood as anybody in Colorado, and mebby a little better. We get along\ntogether as pleasant as you please, and we are a sort of colony, as you\nmight say, all by ourselves.\n\nMe and Marthy make especial good neighbors. We don't have no fights with\nthe other folks in our end of town, and in them days the neighbors hadn't\nany reason to fight with us, for we didn't keep a dog and we hadn't\nno children! I take notice that it is other folks dogs and children\nthat make most of the bad feelin's between neighbors. Of course we had\nmosquitos, but Providence gives everybody something to practise up\ntheir patience, and when me and Marthy sat out on our porch and heard\nother people's children frettin' because the mosquitos was bad, we just\nsat there behind our screened porch and thanked our stars that we did\nn't have no children to leave our screen doors open.\n\nIt was n't but right that me and Marthy should act accordingly. I don't\nmean that we were uppish about it, but we did feel that we could live a\nlittle better than our neighbors that had all the expense of children,\nand if our house was fixed up a little better, and we was able to go off\nthree or four weeks in the summer to the mountains, when all the rest\nstayed right at home, we had a right to feel pleased about it. Lots of\ntimes we had things our neighbors could n't afford, and then the little\nwoman would say to me: \u201cHiram, you don't know how thankful I am that we\nain't got any children,\u201d and I agreed with her every time, and did it\nhearty, too.\n\n'T was n't that we hated children. Far from it. We just thought that\nwhen we saw all the extra worry and trouble and expense that other\npeople's children brought about, we were right satisfied to live the way\nwe had lived the five years since we was married--our neighbors still\ncalled us the \u201cBride and Groom.\u201d Nor I can't say that we were happier\nthan the other folks in our end of town, but we was more care-free. We\nlived more joyous, as you might say.\n\nOne night when I come home from the store Marthy met me at the corner,\nand when I had tucked her arm under mine, I asked her what was the news.\nBobby Jones had cut his finger bad; Stell Marks had took the measles;\nlittle Tot Hemingway had run off, and her ma had gone near crazy until\nthe kid was found again; the Wallaces was n't goin' to take no vacation\nthis year at all because Fred was to go off to school in the fall, and\nthey could n't afford both. It was the usual lot of news of children\nbein' trouble and expense.\n\nI was feelin' fine, the next day bein' a holiday, and Marthy, with the\nslick way women has, sprung a favor on me just when she set the broiled\nsteak on the table. Extry thick, and burnt brown--that's my favorite\nsteak--and whenever I see it that way my mouth waters, and I look out\nfor a favor to be asked.\n\n\u201cHiram,\u201d she says, quite as if she was openin' up a usual bit of talk,\n\u201cdid you take notice of Mrs. Hemingway's silk dress last Sunday?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy no, Marthy,\u201d I says, \u201cI didn't. Was it new?\u201d\n\n\u201cNew!\u201d she laughed. \u201cThe idee! That's just what it wasn't. I believe she\nhas had that same silk ever since we have lived in this end of town, and\nno one knows how much longer. It's a shame. She puts every cent she can\ndig up on those children of hers, and has hardly a decent thing of her\nown. I feel right sorry for her.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel sorry for Hemingway,\u201d says I. \u201cThe old boy is workin' himself to\ndeath. He never gits home until supper is all over, and he told me just\nnow that he felt it his bounden duty to work to-morrow. I tell you,\nMarthy, children is an expensive luxury!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's just what they are,\u201d she agreed. \u201cIf it wasn't for their\nchildren, the Hemingways could live every bit as good as we do, and he\nwouldn't have to work of nights, poor fellow. But, Hiram,\u201d she says, as\nif the idee had just hit her, \u201cdo you recall to mind when this end of\ntown has seen a new silk dress?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, no--no,\u201d I said; \u201cwhen was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYears ago!\u201d says the little woman. \u201cI was figgerin' it up to-day, and\nit was full two years ago. Ain't it awful?\u201d\n\n\u201cDownright scandalous!\u201d I says. \u201cAnd just on account of those children,\ntoo!\u201d\n\nMarthy looked down at her plate, innocent as you please.\n\n\u201cI'm glad we ain't got any children, Hiram,\u201d she says, full of mischief.\n\nThat tickled me. I was tickled to see how she was tickled to think she\nhad trapped me.\n\n\u201cI guess it's our bounden duty to hold up the honor of our end of town\nby showin' it a new silk dress,\u201d I says, and the next thing I knew I was\nfightin' to keep her from chokin' me to death.\n\nAll that evening Marthy was unusual quiet and right happy, too. As she\nsat on the porch her eyes would wander off over-the-hills-and-far-away,\nand I knew she was lost in joyous tanglements of bias and gores and\nplaits, where a man can't foller if he wants to. But when we went inside\nand had the blinds pulled down she put her arms around my neck again and\ngave me another choke.\n\n\u201cDear, dear old Hiram!\u201d she says, and her eyes was tear-wet. \u201cJust\nthink! A new silk dress!\u201d And just then there came into the room the\nnoise of the Marks child--the one with the measles--whimpering.\n\n\u201cAin't you glad,\u201d says the little woman, \u201cthat we haven't any children\nto spoil all our fun, and bother us?\u201d and when I looked down into that\nhappy little face of hers, I was glad, and no mistake.\n\nThe next day was a beauty. It came in like a glory, and we was up\nalmost as soon as the sun was; for we had figgered on one of our regular\nold-time jolly days by ourselves on the hills--one of the kind that made\nour end of town call us the \u201cBride and Groom.\u201d It was our plan to take\na good lunch, and just wander. Marthy was to take a book, and I was to\ntake my fishin' tackle, and beyond that was whatever happy thing that\nturned up.\n\n\u201cIf we had children,\u201d she said, \u201cwe couldn't go off on these long tramps\nby ourselves.\u201d\n\nWe got away while the neighbors in our end of town were still at\nbreakfast, and as we passed the Wallace's place we ran up to holler\ngood-by through the window at them, and there was the youngest Wallace\nfoolin' on the floor with her stockings not on yet, and breakfast half\nover. Marthy stopped long enough to have a good, long look at the child.\n\n\u201cIf all the children was like Daisy Wallace,\u201d she says, \u201cthey wouldn't\nbe so bad. She is the dearest thing I ever did see. She's got the cutest\nway of kissin' a person on the eyelids.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe looks to be just as lazy in the dressin' act as the rest,\u201d I\nremarked, and I was surprised, the way Marthy turned on me.\n\n\u201cWhy, Hiram Smith!\u201d she cried; \u201cdidn't _you_ ever dawdle over your\ndressin'? When I was a girl I got lots of fun out of being late to\nbreakfast. What difference does it make, anyway, when she is perfectly\nlovely all the rest of the time? I simply love that child. I wonder,\u201d\n she said, sort of wistful, \u201cif they would let us take her with us\nto-day. She would enjoy it so.\u201d\n\n\u201cFoolishness,\u201d I said. \u201cWe don't want to pull a kid along with us all\nday; and anyhow, they are going to take her to the photographer's to-day\nto have her picture took.\u201d\n\nWe went out around town, and up the hill road. The morning air was\ngreat, and nobody on the road at all, so far as we could see, and we\nstepped out brisk and lively.\n\n\u201cSeems good to git away from the baby district, don't it?\u201d I says, as\nwe was walkin' up the road. \u201cWe 're like Mister and Missus Robinson\nCrusoe,\u201d and at the very next turn we most fell over Bobby Jones and his\neverlastin' chum, Rex, which is the most no-account dog on earth.\n\n\u201cWhere y' goin'?\u201d he asks.\n\n\u201cNowheres particular,\u201d says Marthy. \u201cJust walkin' out to git the air.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo'm I,\u201d says he, and then he says, sort of bluffin', \u201cI ain't lost.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes you are, Bobby,\u201d I says, severe as I could, \u201cand if you know what's\ngood for a kid about your size you'd better turn right 'round and scoot\nfor home.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me as if he would like to know who I was, to be bossin'\nhim.\n\n\u201cHo!\u201d he says, \u201cYou ain't my pa. I don't have to do what you say! I\nwon't go home for you!\u201d\n\nMarthy was bendin' over him in a second.\n\n\u201cBobby,\u201d she says, coaxing-like, \u201cdo you know what your folks is going\nto have for dinner?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo'm,\u201d he says, as polite as you please.\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d says the little woman. \u201cIce cream. And if you git lost you won't\ngit home in time to git any.\u201d\n\nBobby looked up the road where he hadn't explored yet, and then looked\nback the way he'd come, and then he smiled at Marthy and took off his\ncap to her.\n\n\u201cThank you, Missus Smith,\u201d he says.\n\nMarthy laughed as happy as a girl, and kissed him right on his dusty\nface. She put her arms around him, even, and acted like she had never\nseen a freckled boy before.\n\n\u201cNice boy,\u201d I remarked, when Bobby had gone down the road toward town.\n\n\u201cNice!\u201d says the little woman. \u201cNice! Is that all you can scrape up to\nsay? Why, there ain't a dearer child in our end of town than what Bobby\nis. He's my sweetheart when you ain't at home. Hiram,\u201d she says, looking\nback at him as he paddled along kicking up the dust with his bare toes,\n\u201cI wonder if we dare take him with us?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about his ice-cream?\u201d I says. \u201cWhat about having a kid dragging\nafter us all day?\u201d So we went on, but I seen she felt a little mite\nlonely-like, as you might say. Which was queer.\n\nBy ten o'clock we had got far enough from town, and we pushed through\na field that was all covered with flowers, and over to where the brook\nwas, with the tangle of trees and brush hiding it, and when I pushed\napart the brush to go through, I stopped and motioned for Marthy to come\nquiet and look.\n\nThere, sittin' on a tree trunk, as quiet as you please, was Teddy\nLawrence, with his eyes glued on to his bobber, and thinkin' of nothing\nin the world but fish. I'm a right hearty fisher myself, and it done my\nheart good to see the strictly-business way that kid had. Marthy moved a\nlittle, and I put my hand on her to make her keep still.\n\nThe boy lifted up his pole and looked at the bait like a regular old\nhand. He dug a fresh, fat worm out of his can, and fixed it, and then I\nfairly held my breath. Would he do it? No! But, hold on--yes! He leaned\nover and spit on the bait to bring luck, just as natural as life! Say,\nwasn't that real boy for you? I let the brush come together real quiet,\nand me and Marthy slipped away.\n\nWell, sir, my five-dollar pole and my two-dollar reel, made me feel\nsick.\n\nWhat did I know about fishing, anyhow? I felt right there what was the\ntruth, that all my fishing amounted to was, that I was tryin' to bring\nback the joys I used to have when I was a kid, settin' on a log, happy\nand lonesome, watchin' my bottle-cork joggle on the ripples. What was\nthe use? A feller can't go back to them days. There ain't nothing to do\nabout it. Unless, of course, he can sort of go forward to them in--well,\na feller could sort of live them days over agin in a boy of his own.\n\n\u201cWallace don't deserve that boy,\u201d I says, sort of mad about I don't know\nwhat. \u201cWhat sort of a dad is that old book-worm of a Wallace for a boy\nthat likes to fish like Ted does? I'll bet Wallace never had a fish pole\nin his hands since the day he was born. Now, if I had a boy like that I\ncould show him a thing or two about fishing. If I had a boy like that--\u201d\n\n\u201cLook there!\u201d says Marthy, sudden. \u201cDid you ever see anything sweeter\nthan what that is?\u201d\n\nOver on the other end of the field Ted's sister was strayin' around\nin the flowers, her face all rosy with the fresh air. She was like a\nbutterfly in amongst the butterflies, a mighty pretty girl, and just\nthe age when a mother loves a girl best and when a mother takes the most\ncare of 'em. I like pretty things as well as the next man does, and I'll\nsay right here that there was something about that girl that made me\nfeel like I'd like to own her--just like I feel about a real pretty\nrose, sort of covet to keep it just as it is forever, and take care that\nit don't git spoiled any way.\n\n\u201cI guess Mrs. Wallace don't rightly appreciate May,\u201d says Marthy,\nthoughtful-like. \u201cI thinks she makes her study too much. When I was\nMay's age I had plenty of chances to git the fresh air, and you'd never\nsee me takin' up music-lessons in the summer. I spent my time feedin'\nthe chickens and runnin' about the farm, and enjoyin' life. It ain't\nright, the way girls is forced in their studies nowadays. If I had a\ngirl like that--\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you had, what'd you do?\u201d I asks, kindly enough, but the little woman\nonly laughed. Mebby her laugh was a bit reckless, as you might say.\n\n\u201cWhat's the use thinkin' what I'd do?\u201d she says, turnin' round to go.\nThere didn't seem to be nothing special for me to say right then, so I\njust put my arm around her, and we went on.\n\nWe was plumb tired out when we got home, and mebby that is why we was\nmore than usual quiet at dinner. I sure wasn't cross, but somehow our\nday hadn't panned out as satisfactory as we'd thought it would, and\nmebby the cryin' of the Wilkins' new baby got on my nerves, we being\ntired. I was glad when dinner was over and we could take our chairs and\ngo out on the porch.\n\nIt was a fine night--still, and ca'm as you please. The only noise, not\ncountin' the cryin' of the Wilkins' kid, was the sounds of the laughin'\nand chatter of the children in our end of town. But I was lonesome.\nI can't speak for the little woman, how she felt, but _I_ felt\nlonesome--and her right there beside me, too.\n\nAcross the street we could see the two Hemingway children, who had\ncoaxed an extra half hour to wait for their father to come home before\nthey went to bed. They had their heads bent over a tumbler that they had\ncaught two fireflies in, and on the porch Mrs. Hemingway was rockin' the\nsleepy baby.\n\nThen we heard Hemingway's whistle--he can't whistle, but he likes\nto--and the two children dropped the tumbler, and run to the gate, and\nthen there was a rush, and a mingling up of Hemingway kids and father,\nand the sleepy baby slid down from its ma's lap and stood, unsteady but\ntryin' to git in the kissing, with its arms held out. Happy?\n\nI turned to the little woman, and I looked straight at her. Somehow I\nknew that now, if ever, was a time for me to do some cheering-up.\n\n\u201cWell, little woman,\u201d I says, cheerful-like, \u201c_we_ don't need a lot of\nkids to bolster up our love, do we?\u201d\n\nShe gave my hand a soft squeeze in reply.\n\n\u201cAnd about that gown--that silk gown,\u201d I says, gaily. \u201cHave you decided\nwhat color it is to be yet?\n\n\u201cWon't you be fine! When I think how fine you'll look, I'm glad we\nhaven't no children to--\u201d\n\nJust then them Hemingways went inside, and our whole end of town was\nquiet, and lonesome.\n\nMarthy didn't answer, and when I lifted up her face to kiss her, what\nd'you think? She was cryin'!\n\n\n\n\nII. WHEN SHE CAME\n\nAfore the kid come, me and Marthy used to sit up nights tellin' each\nother how much we'd like it if she turned out to be a boy. I said\neverything that I knowed that was nice about boys, and drawed on my\nimagination for what I didn't know, and Marthy spoke the same; so I\nconvinced Marthy, thorough, that I would be terrible disappointed if it\nwasn't a boy, and she didn't leave me no doubts about her hankerin' for\na baby of the male sect.\n\nCourse we was both tryin' to square ourselves in case it _should_ be a\nboy. Come to find out, we was both of us tickled to death that it was a\ngirl.\n\nWe'd talked over boys' names by the bushel without ever coming to a\ndead-set choice, but we most always squeezed in somewhere, sort of\napologetic, a remark that if it _should_ happen to be a girl we'd have\nto call it Edith L., after its grandmother. Somehow, as I look back on\nit, it seems as if I'd never thought of that kid, at any time, except as\nEdith L. Curious how folks will try to fool theirselves that way.\n\nWhen it come to the auspicious occasion we had Doc Wolfert in, because\nhe was the only doc in our end of town. He certainly was a quaint old\nbone-setter. Some said he took morphine on the sly, and some said it was\njust his natural manner, but he was the shiftiest-eyed medic you ever\nsaw. No man livin' ever got him to say plain yes or no. He'd walk all\n'round them little words, like he was afraid of steppin' on them,\nand his gab was full of perhapses and possiblys, and similar slick\nside-trackers of knowledge.\n\nI had figgered that when the aforesaid auspicious occasion turned up\nI'd clean out to the woods until things got so I'd be useful as well as\nornamental; but when it come to a show-down, I couldn't. Farthest away I\ncould git was the front porch. I done my good twenty miles on the porch\nthat day, I'll bet, and whenever I've had a trial and tribulation time\nsince then, I can hear the sixth board from the south end of that porch\nsqueak.\n\nI was walkin' on the level, but my spirits was climbin' hills and\ncoastin' into valleys. First minute I would be stickin' out my chest\nand thinkin' how all-fired grand it would be to be a daddy, and the next\nminute I'd cave in like a frost-bitten squash and wonder how in\ncreation I'd ever drag along as a widow-man. One minute I'd see myself\nsky-hootin' round with a fine kid on my arm, and the next I'd see myself\nalone, with Marthy gone. I've got the reputation around here of being a\nhumorist man, but I didn't say no funny sayings to myself that day, that\nI can remember. I had fever, and cold sweats, and double contraction\nof the heart, and whenever I thought of Marthy, I couldn't think of a\ndecent thing that I'd ever done to her. I felt I was an ornery, lowdown\ncritter--which I ain't--and I saw Marthy as a spotless angel--which\nshe ain't neither. She's woman and earthly all through, and mighty good\nearth at that. Marthy never knew what a good chance she lost of being\nconsidered a perfectionated saint, but she missed the chance.\n\nJust about when I'd given up all hopes of ever seein' Marthy alive\nagain, Mrs. Murphy, (who we'd got in to sort of give the kid its first\ntoilet, it not being expected to be far enough advanced to do much\nprimping on its own account right at first) come to the door like a\nblessed ray of sunshine, and percolated out a smile at me.\n\nLoony as I was, I had sense enough left to know that she wasn't smilin'\nat me for flirtation, nor because she had a smile that she didn't know\nwhat to do with and so was passing it out to me, like a hand-out, just\nto git rid of it. I connected that smile with other things. I knowed she\nwas smiling me back from a desolate widow-hood, or widow-man-hood, or\nwhatever the right word is. I know the right word, but it's got mislaid.\nThank the stars I ain't ever had no use for it, and I hope never to\nhave. But I guess every man feels like I did when I was walkin' that\nporch. When they shut the door on him, and turn him out, and tell him\nthey will call him when they want him, he's a widow-man right from that\nmoment and feels so. And when they call him in and say all's doin' as\nwell as could be expected under the circumstances, right then he feels\nlike his wife had rose from the dead, and he becomes a married man\nagain. I felt so, anyhow, and I don't know as I'm a specially fancy\nfeeler. I don't look it.\n\nRight then I was boosted, like I tell you, from a deep black hole to a\nhigh and airy location, and by a plain-faced, baggy Irish lady that did\nwashing by the day at fifty cents a day, and you furnished the soap.\nShe's been my friend ever since, and always will be.\n\nAs I passed in, feelin' more like war-whoopin' than like walkin' soft,\nshe whispered three words at me that finished me up.\n\n\u201cIt's a girl,\u201d says she. \u201cWalk light, and stay where you are, and when\nyou can come in and see the girl, I'll bring her out and show her to\nyou.\u201d\n\nI was clean idiotic with satisfaction. I sat down on the edge of a chair\nand twirled my hat until I couldn't sit still, and then got up and edged\nround the room lookin' at the pictures on the wall, for all the world\nlike I was a visitor. I'd got half-way through lookin' at the things\non the what-not, and was castin' my eye round for the photygraft album,\nwhen Mrs. Murphy stuck her blessed face into the parlor.\n\n\u201c'Sh-h!\u201d says she, \u201cmake no noise, and control your feelin's, and you\ncan come in for a quarter of a second and see your daughter.\u201d\n\nI was so proud I had cold chills, and I walked like a clothes-horse on\ncastors.\n\nI looked for Marthy first, and I see she was a-sleepin' beautiful, and\nthen Mrs. Murphy pulled down the covers and showed me Edith L.\n\nI took her all in at a glance, and I formed my own opinion right there.\nI was like a rubber balloon when you stick a pin in it, but I didn't\ncollapse with a bang, I just caved in gradual. I went out of the room,\nand out of the house, and sat down on the porch-step and blubbered. They\nnever missed me.\n\nWhen I think back on that day it makes me laugh, but I was sure a rank\namateur in the baby business, and I didn't know no better then. Right\nnow I'd put up every cent I've got that you couldn't find a finer girl\nin the state than what Edith L. is, and I've learned since that she was\nwhat you might call an A-1 baby right from the start, but it didn't look\nthat way to me. She was the first of that age I'd ever been introduced\nto, and she looked different than what I'd fig-gered on. I'd seen plenty\nof brand new colts, and they run largely to legs, but you'd know them\nfor horse-critters right off; and I 've seen brand-new puppies, and\ntheir eyes ain't open, but you'd know them immediate for dogs; but that\nkid didn't look any more like what I'd calculated Edith L. would look\nlike, than a cucumber looks like a water-melon. My heart was plumb\nbroke. I was scairt when I thought what would happen to Marthy when she\nsaw that wrinkled, red little thing.\n\nI knew we'd have to keep it, but I didn't see how we could bear the\nshame. I made up my mind in a minute that we'd sell off the place and\nmove up into the mountains--just me and Marthy and the girl. I didn't\nthink of her as Edith L. any more. It wouldn't do to insult mother by\ngivin' her name to that baby.\n\nI figgered it all out how I'd act better to Marthy than ever, to make up\nfor the trial that girl would be, and how I'd do all in man's power to\nkeep the girl from knowin' how handicapped she was by her looks.\n\nJust then Brink Tuomy passed by, and he says:\n\n\u201cHow's things comin' along?\u201d\n\nThe boys had all been mighty interested in this baby business, and I\nknew he'd trot off and tell them, so I says, sad enough:\n\n\u201cIt's a girl.\u201d\n\nBrink seen I wasn't very jubilant, so he says:\n\n\u201cYou don't seem very stuck up about it. But girls ain't so bad--when you\ngit used to them. Lady all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I says, \u201cshe's O. K.\u201d\n\nBrink hung round a minute or two, waitin' for further orders, and none\ncomin', he says, hesitatin':\n\n\u201cSo long!\u201d\n\nI let him go and was glad he went.\n\nI looked out across the river, and calculated how I could fix it so Mrs.\nMurphy wouldn't say nothin' outside about that poor kid of mine, and how\nto keep the kid hid until me and Marthy could take her and skin out for\nthe mountains.\n\nMrs. Murphy was a terrible chatty lady--sort of perpetual phonygraft,\nand wholesale and retail news agency. I guessed the best I could do was\nto lock her in the cellar and then herd all comers away from the house.\n\nDoc Wolfert didn't bother me any. I knowed _he_ wouldn't give me away.\n\nIf anybody could so much as git him to admit that there was a baby born\nat my house they would be lucky. Just as a sample of what Doc was like,\ntake the case of Sandy Sam, who fell down the mine shaft and was brought\nup in the bucket, as dead as Adam. Doc was on the ground as soon as\nthey brought Sandy up, and one of the boys that come late asked Doc what\ncaused the crowd to congregate.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says Doc, lookin' off at an angle into the air, \u201cit looks like\nSandy Sam, or some other feller, fell down the mine shaft.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoor old Sam,\u201d says the feller, \u201ckilled him, didn't it?\u201d\n\nDoc looked at the sky and considered.\n\n\u201cIt's a remarkable deep shaft,\u201d he says at last; \u201cremarkable deep.\u201d\n \u201cThunder!\u201d says the feller. \u201cI know it's a deep shaft. What I asked you\nis if Sam's dead. Is he?\u201d\n\nDoc went off into a dream, and when he come to, he looks at the feller.\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d he says, absent like. \u201cIs Sam dead? Perhaps! Perhaps he is.\nI shouldn't like to say. But,\u201d he ended up, sort of pullin' hisself\ntogether at the finish, \u201cI wouldn't like to express an opinion, but I\nguess the boys think he is. They are goin' to bury him.\u201d\n\nSo I wasn't afraid of Doc Wolfert blabbin'. I knowed the worst, and,\nlike everybody else, I wanted somebody to tell me it wasn't so bad as I\nthought.\n\nI nailed Doc as he come out. I backed him up against a porch pillar and\nconversed with him right there. I wanted to know just how bad it was. I\nwanted to know what hope there was, if any.\n\n\u201cDoc,\u201d I said--and I was blessed glad I had a beard so he couldn't see\nthe quivers in my chin--\u201cshe's terrible undersized, ain't she?\u201d\n\n\u201cHum!\u201d says Doc. \u201cYou might call her small or you mightn't. I've seen\n'em bigger, and I 've seen 'em smaller. I've seen 'em all sizes.\u201d\n\nI couldn't see much help in that. \u201cDoc,\u201d I said, tremblin', \u201cshe won't\nalways be so--so dwarfed like, will she? She'll grow--some?\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably,\u201d says Doc. \u201cI'd hate to say she wouldn't.\u201d\n\nI groaned. I had to.\n\n\u201cAin't her head a little off shape, Doc?\u201d I stammered out. I guess the\nshape of the head had worried me most of all. It wasn't just what I'd\nknown good heads to be.\n\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d asked Doc, absent like.\n\n\u201cDon't you?\u201d I went back at him.\n\n\u201cTell me straight. I can stand the worst.\u201d\n\n\u201cHum!\u201d he says. \u201cHeads differ. I've got to go--\u201d\n\n\u201cNo you don't!\u201d I says, backing him up against the post; \u201cnot till\nyou tell me. Her legs, now. Think they will ever straighten out? Think\nshe'll ever git over that red, scalded look? Think she'll ever be able\nto talk, Doc?\u201d\n\nDoc looked anxious toward the road.\n\n\u201cDon't worry,\u201d he says. \u201cDon't fret. Keep cool and ca'm.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I says, scornful like. \u201cMe keep cool! Don't you know I'm that\npoor little, bent-up kid's daddy? Don't you know I looked forward\nto callin' her Edith L.? Don't you know--? Doc,\u201d I says, strong and\nforcible, \u201cmoney ain't no object in a case like this. Tell me this:\nShall I git a specialist? Would it do any good to send to Denver and\ngit a specialist, or Chicago, or New York?\u201d Doc looked interested at the\nhorizon.\n\n\u201cWhy, no,\u201d he says, \u201cno! I don't see that it would.\u201d\n\nI'll bet that that was the first time Doc ever said \u201cNo\u201d straight out.\nIt settled me. I let go of his arm and sat right down. If Doc Wolfert\nspoke up and said \u201cNo\u201d I knew there wasn't nothing to be done.\n\nI sat there probably about a thousand years, if you count by feelin's.\nI had a wish to go in and see the kid, and then, again, I hated to.\nI hated for Mrs. Murphy to look at me; I felt I'd blubber, and I was\nashamed; but I knew I'd ought to be there to take Marthy's hand when she\nwoke up, and to lie to her about it not bein' so bad as she would think.\n\nThat made me pull myself together. I made up my mind that I'd be a man,\nanyway. I had Marthy to think of, and a man ain't made to be blubberin'\naround when his women need help. I swallowed down the chunk of my neck\nthat had got stuck in my throat, and swiped my eyes, and stood on my\nlegs. When I turned, Mrs. Murphy was in the door.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she says, \u201cyou don't take much interest, I must say. Here you\nsit enjoyin' the landscape, and your daughter askin' where her father\nhas gone to, and is she an orphan or what. Come in,\u201d she says, \u201cor\nshe'll be comin' out.\u201d\n\nI walked in.\n\nI stopped a bit by the bedroom door to git up my courage, and then I\nwalked into the room.\n\nMarthy had her eyes open, and they looked up at me with a smile in them,\nand then looked down again at the bunch on her arm under the quilt.\n\n\u201cCome and see her,\u201d she says, feeble but proud. \u201cCome and see your\ndaughter, Edith L.\u201d\n\nShe slid down the covers so I could see her, and I looked at that kid\nwith a sick grin.\n\n\u201cAin't she lovely?\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cSure!\u201d I says, lying bravely.\n\n\u201cDon't talk,\u201d says Mrs. Murphy, speakin' to Marthy, \u201cor the session is\nended.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust one word,\u201d I says. \u201cMarthy, are you satisfied with her--with the\nkid?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe's perfect!\u201d she says, \u201cperfect and lovely.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I says, \u201cthen I don't mind.\u201d\n\nMarthy smiled, sort of weak.\n\n\u201cYou will joke,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cJoke!\u201d says Mrs. Murphy, indignant; \u201cinsult, I call it. Did you ever\nsee a finer baby?\u201d\n\nI looked to see if she winked. She didn't.\n\n\u201cHow so?\u201d I asked, my voice all of a tremble.\n\n\u201cHow so?\u201d she asks; \u201cNo 'how so' at all. She weighs ten pounds, and\nshe's sound in wind and limb,\u201d she says, \u201cand look at the grand shape\nof her head! She'll be a college professoress at least, or maybe in\nCongress before her pa. It's a grand baby she is!\u201d\n\n\u201cTen pounds!\u201d I says; \u201cain't that some dwarfish?\u201d\n\n\u201cHear the man!\u201d she says. \u201cI don't believe he knows a fine baby when he\nsees one.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean that, Mrs. Murphy?\u201d I asked, every bit of blood in me goin'\non the jump.\n\n\u201cMean it?\u201d she says; \u201cI've had six of my own, and not one of them could\nhold a candle to this one.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarthy!\u201d I says. \u201cIs it so?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Murphy has fine children,\u201d she says; \u201cbut my little girl, I think,\nis finer.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow's her head?\u201d I asked. \u201cPerfect,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cAnd her color?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo healthy,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cAnd her legs?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo straight and strong,\u201d she says. I took hold of her hand and squeezed\nit good, and then I went to the window and looked out, and I saw all the\nboys lined up along the fence waitin' for me to come out and let them\nknow that what I'd told Brink Tuomy was so.\n\nProud? I was so proud I felt like givin' Mrs. Murphy a million dollars.\n\n\u201cDang it!\u201d I yelped. \u201cLet her dad have another good look at Edith L.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIII. THE DAY OF THE SPANK\n\n\nNOW, you just take a good look this here right fist of mine.\n\nLooks like a ham, don't it? And see all them callouses on the palm.\nAin't that a tool fit to break rock with? And what'd you say if I told\nyou I used that once to hit that little, tender kid of mine? Actually\nhit her! What you say to that? I won't forgit that night soon, I tell\nyou!\n\nJust figger to yourself that it's sundown, and the blinds pulled down in\nthe room where Deedee's cot was standin' like a little iron-barred\ncage. We got into the way of callin' the kid Deedee, that bein' what she\ncalled herself. There was all the signs that Deedee was goin' to sleep,\nand the plainest sign was Deedee herself, standin' up in her crib, wide\nawake, holdin' on to the foot of the crib, trampin' the sheets into a\ntangle of white underbrush, as you might say, and no more asleep\nthan you are. The way Deedee went to sleep was like the death of an\nalligator--it was a long and strenuous affair.\n\nMarthy stood lookin' at Deedee with reproaches in her eyes. We had a\nsort of tradition in the family that Deedee had to go to sleep quick\nand quiet, without any nonsense. Every night, when Marthy put the little\nwhite rascal in the crib, she had hopes that the tradition would come\ntrue, and every night it didn't. The go-to-sleep hour was the time\nDeedee seemed to pick out to have an hour of especial lively fun, and\nfor weeks she had been breakin' the laws, and walkin' all over the rules\nwith her pink feet. She did not see, comin' up over the horizon, and\ngittin' nearer every day, the stern and horrid Spank!\n\nWe had got together in a sort of family conclave and decided that Deedee\nwas about old enough to be punished by layin' on of hands. We decided\nit one time when Deedee was out of the room, and we had been right stern\nabout it. We could be stern about Deedee when she wasn't in sight. When\nshe come smilin' and singin' along we generally had to quit bein' stern,\nand kiss her.\n\nDeedee was twenty-two months old, and she was ninety-eight per cent,\npure sweetness. Some of the women in our end of town said her short,\ncurly hair was tow-colored, but it wasn't so--they was just envious of\nus. And one and all said her eyes was like round little bits of blue\nsky. It was clear enough that she had inherited her sweetness from\nMarthy; and some said it was equal clear that the two per cent, of\nunadulterated stubbornness come from me. I said so myself, but I didn't\nbelieve it.\n\nDeedee was gittin' to be a regular person. She could tell what she\nwanted, and once in a while we could understand what it was. It was full\ntime, everybody said, that her education had ought to begin. If she was\ngoin' to grow up into a fine, sincere woman like Marthy, she must have\nthe right kind of start. Just the night before the day of the Spank,\nMarthy had begun to teach her her religious education. Standin' up\nat Marthy's knee--for Deedee would not kneel to God or man--she had\nrepeated:--\n\n     \u201cNowee-laimee-downee-seep,\n     Padee-O-so-tee.\u201d\n\nAnybody had ought to know that was:--\n\n     \u201cNow I lay me down to sleep,\n     I pray the Lord my soul to keep.\u201d\n\nIt was a fine success for a first start, only she didn't do what she\nsaid she was goin' to do and \u201clay me down to sleep.\u201d Instead of that she\nstood up in her crib for about an hour, callin' for \u201cMamie,\u201d the meanin'\nof which was that she wanted to be rocked and have Marthy sing \u201cMary had\na little lamb,\u201d to her.\n\nThe day of the Spank had a bad openin'. When Deedee woke up, along\nabout five o'clock a.m., it was rainin' pitchforks, and that meant a\nday indoors, and to start off, she stood up in her crib and called for\n\u201claim.\u201d\n\nMarthy woke up sort of realizin' that Deedee was repeatin' that word\nslow, but regular, and she sat up and thought. \u201cLaim\u201d was a new word,\nand the meanin' of it was unknown, but, whatever it was, Deedee wanted\nit. She wanted it bad. Nothin' but \u201claim\u201d would satisfy her.\n\nMarthy studied that word good and hard. It did not seem to suggest\nanything to eat or drink, and, as near as Marthy could make out, it\ndidn't rightly apply to any toy, game, song, person, or anything else.\nMarthy woke me up, and I sat up with a sigh. Deedee looked at me as if\nshe thought she would git what she wanted now, sure.\n\n\u201cLaim, Deedee?\u201d I asked, and she smiled as sweet as you please.\n\n\u201cPapa, laim!\u201d she says again. \u201cLaim!\u201d I says, thoughtful, lookin' around\nthe room and up at the ceilin'. I screwed up my forehead and studied,\nand twisted my neck to look into the next room. \u201cLaim! What's a 'laim,'\nanyhow?\u201d\n\n\u201cI give it up,\u201d I says, after I'd thought of everything in the world,\npretty near. \u201cMebby her grandpa would know. Mebby it's something he\ntaught her.\u201d\n\nWe lifted Deedee out of her crib, and set her down on the floor, and\nshe pattered down the hall. We could hear her tellin' him to give her\n\u201claim,\u201d and the puzzled way he answered her back.\n\n\u201cLaim, birdy? What is it? Say it again, Deedee. Laim? Grand-daddy don't\nknow what you want, Deedee.\u201d\n\nNeither did Uncle Ed, who was stayin' with us about then. Nobody knew\nwhat \u201claim\u201d was but Deedee, and she wanted it the worst way. She come\nback, and stood by Marthy's bed, and just begged for it.\n\nIt was a hard day for Marthy. It was Monday, and wash-day, so Deedee\ncouldn't bother Katie in the kitchen, and it was rainin' too. Deedee\njust wandered through the house, like she had lost her last friend, and\nthen she would come back to Marthy and ask for \u201claim.\u201d She wouldn't have\nnothing to do with her toys, and she wouldn't sew with a pin, and\nshe wouldn't sit at the table and write, and she wouldn't look at the\nphotygraft book. And the worst of it was that she wouldn't keep still a\nminute.\n\nBy noon-time Marthy had a headache. By sundown she had \u201cnerves,\u201d and\nabout then she began to look at Deedee with a sort of reproachful look.\nDeedee had said that unknown word about ten thousand times. Marthy put\nDeedee to bed in her crib, and I read once how Wellington, at Waterloo,\nin the big fight they had there, prayed for night or Bl\u00fccher, and that\nwas about how Marthy longed for the sandman or me to come. I was the\none that come, at last. I come in the house wet to the skin, and plumb\ndisgusted; my pants stickin' to my legs and all over mud, and I chucked\nmy soakin' hat and my umbrelly into a corner, the way a tired-out man\nwill, and just dropped into a chair, tuckered out. I let out one good,\nlong sigh of thanks that I was at the end of a hard day.\n\n\u201cHiram!\u201d comes Marthy's voice; \u201cCome in here, and see if you can do\nanything with Edith. I have worked with her all day, and I'm played out;\nI'm utter tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, plague!\u201d I says. I sat a minute, drummin' on the arm of my chair,\nand then I got upon my feet, and walked into the bedroom.\n\n\u201cWhat's the matter?\u201d I says, as near cross as I calculate I ever git,\nand Marthy's eyes filled up.\n\n\u201cI _can't_ do anything with her,\u201d she says. \u201cShe _won't_ go to sleep.\nShe has been dreadful all day. I don't feel like I could stand it\nanother minute.\u201d Marthy threw herself on the bed and covered up her face\nwith her hands. She was cryin'.\n\nI guess I frowned.\n\nDeedee looked up at me as sweet as a little angel.\n\n\u201cPapa, laim,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d says I, \u201cNo laim, Deedee. You lie down and go to sleep like a good\ngirl. Papa'll fix your pillow nice.\u201d\n\nI pounded up her pillow, and turned it over, and pulled the sheets out\nstraight. Then I took the baby and laid her down gentle. She smiled and\ncuddled into the pillow.\n\n\u201cOh, what a nice bed!\u201d I says. \u201cAin't it a nice bed, Deedee?\u201d\n\n\u201cNice bed,\u201d she allowed.\n\n\u201cWill I cover your feet?\u201d I says.\n\n\u201cFeet cov,\u201d she _says_, eager.\n\nSo I spread the sheet up over her feet.\n\n\u201cShut little eyes,\u201d I says in warning, but as gentle as you please, and\nshe shut up her eyes so tight her eyelids wrinkled.\n\n\u201cNow, good night, Deedee,\u201d I says.\n\n\u201c'Night, pa--pa!\u201d she coos.\n\nI stole out of the room as quiet as I knowed how, and dropped cautious\ninto my chair. I leaned back and smiled sort of grim. \u201cThat shows,\u201d I\nthinks, \u201cthat women ain't got the right kind of tact to handle a kid, or\nelse they 've got catchin' nerves. It shows how easy a man can--\u201d\n\n\u201cPapa, laim!\u201d\n\nDeedee's clear little voice just cut what I was thinkin' into two\npieces. I was into that bedroom in about two steps. Deedee was standin'\nup in her crib.\n\n\u201cPapa, laim?\u201d she says, sort of anxious.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d I says, stern in earnest. \u201cNo laim!\u201d\n\n\u201cPapa, laim!\u201d she demands.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d I says, in a way that froze her smile right where it was. She\nlooked up at me doubtful-like, her little pink and white chin puckered\nup all ready to cry.\n\n\u201cPapa, laim, laim!\u201d she pleaded.\n\nI reached over and forced her right back on to her pillow.\n\n\u201cDeedee!\u201d I says, in a voice that was new and that she wasn't acquainted\nwith; \u201cgo to sleep! Be quiet! Stop this instant, or I _will_ SPANK you!\u201d\n\nI guess, mebby, the angels kept on singin' as joyful as ever up in\nHeaven. I guess, mebby, somewhere out west further, the sun was shinin'\ndown gay on noddin', careless flowers. Mebby, even in the next block,\nsome good baby was bein' snuggled up in its ma's arms; but to Deedee,\nlyin' in the corner of her crib, the world had got a million years\nolder in about a minute. Her world that had been all smiles and pleasant\nthings had turned into a world of hard words and cruel faces. Her mama\ndear had on a mask of unfeelin' coldness. Her papa dear stood up there\ntowerin' above her, a sort of giant of wrath, flourishin' an awful,\nmysterious weapon, the word \u201cspank.\u201d\n\nIt looked like everybody had gone back on her. Her friends--which was\nme and Marthy, her playmates--which was me and Marthy, her lovers--which\nwas me and Marthy, the providers of her joy--which was me and Marthy,\nhad turned into avengers. She was all alone in a world of clubs. Just\none wee kid and everybody against her.\n\nShe lay there a minute palpitatin', with her chin tremblin' piteous.\nWhat was to be did when her parents vanished, and these strange, harsh\npeople took their places?\n\nShe crep' to the foot of the crib, where I was still standin', and she\ngot up and took hold of my arm and hugged it.\n\n\u201cPa-pa!\u201d she says, loving.\n\nI pushed her back on the pillow again, gentle but firm.\n\n\u201cEdith,\u201d I says in the hard voice she wasn't acquainted with; \u201cLie down\nand go to sleep. I don't want to have no more of this. Go to sleep!\u201d I\nheard the dinner bell tinkle from the dinin'-room, and I helped Marthy\nto git up, and we went out, and left Deedee alone in the dark.\n\nI ate the first part of my dinner without sayin' anything. It wasn't\nexactly easy to be lively under them circumstances. Even Uncle Ned\ndidn't say nothin', and grand-daddy didn't feel called on to start a\nconversation. It got so we was so quiet it hurt. Uncle Ed made bold to\nspeak.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a kid,\u201d he says, lightly, \u201cI used to git spanked with a\nsix-inch plank.\u201d\n\n\u201cEdward!\u201d says Marthy. \u201cHow can you say such a thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt done me good,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can't begin too young. We 've all got\nthe devil in us, and the only way to git it out is to pound it out.\u201d\n\nMarthy laid down her fork, and her lips trembled.\n\n\u201cCut that out, Ed,\u201d I says. \u201cMarthy has the nerves to-night; the subject\nain't popular.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think she's goin' to be good now,\u201d says grand-daddy, who always stuck\nup for the kid bein' the best that ever lived. \u201cShe seems quiet enough.\nShe must have gone off to sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cI sure do hope so,\u201d says Marthy. \u201cI never had such a day with her.\u201d\n \u201cMama, laim!\u201d came the little voice from the bedroom, of a sudden.\n\n\u201cI met Tuomy to-day,\u201d I says, \u201cand he--\u201d\n\n\u201cMama, laim! Mama, laim!\u201d called Deedee.\n\n\u201cHe asked to be remembered to you,\u201d I says. \u201cHe was with May Wilson--\u201d\n\nFrom the bedroom come a low, maddenin' wail:--\n\n\u201cMama, laim! Papa, laim!\u201d\n\nIt kept gittin' louder. It got to be a regular cry, punctuated off here\nand there with calls for \u201claim.\u201d\n\nMarthy looked at me, hopeless. I seen the look and looked down at my\nplate.\n\n\u201cI'll spank her when I'm done my dinner,\u201d I says. \u201cThere's no other\nway.\u201d\n\nWe didn't say much durin' the rest of that meal. It was a very solemn\nfeast. We was all thinkin' of Deedee. There wasn't no doubt that the\ntime had come we had been afraid of. The punishment and the crime was\nproperly fitted to each other.\n\nNow, or never, was the time to spank; but we was a ridiculous\ntender-hearted family, and, as the dinner went on, the spankin'\nof Deedee loomed up bigger than Pike's Peak. It piled up huge and\nrecord-breakin' above the tea-pots and the puddin's, and looked about as\nimportant as the end of the world, or a big war.\n\nWhen we got up it was like the condemned goin' to the execution, and we\nmarched into the front room like a jury, bringin' in the death verdict,\nfiles into the court room.\n\nDeedee still cried for \u201claim.\u201d\n\nWe four sat down, and looked at the carpet, as gloomy as a funeral.\nI opened my mouth, swallowed hard two times, and shut it again. Uncle\nEdward tapped on the carpet with his toe, grand-daddy looked at one of\nthe spots on the same carpet like it was a personal insult to him, and\nMarthy smoothed out one of the roses on it with her heel. We wasn't half\nso interested in that carpet when we bought it as we looked to be that\nvery minute.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d says Marthy, at last. I kept my eye away from hers. I looked out\nof the window. Next I got up and stood by the window and stuck my hands\ndeep down into my pants pockets.\n\n\u201cIf you 're goin' to--\u201d says Marthy. \u201cIf you ain't--\u201d\n\nDeedee was gittin' too bad to stand. It looked as if the neighbors would\nbe comin' in to complain, next thing.\n\nI turned around and walked slow toward the bedroom. The three other\ngrown-ups sat like stone statures. As I pushed aside the curtains,\nMarthy jumped across the room and grabbed me by the arm.\n\n\u201cHiram!\u201d she cried eager, \u201cYou won't be too severe? You won't git mad\nand hurt her?\u201d\n\n\u201cMarthy,\u201d I says, \u201cif you want to spank her, do so. If you want me to\nspank her, don't you mix in.\u201d I shook her hand off of me, and she went\nback to her chair cryin'.\n\nWell, I went into that bedroom. Deedee left off cryin' when she seen me,\nand in the dim light I could see her standin' in the crib. I stuck out\nmy hand to take her, and she hung on to it.\n\n\u201cPapa, laim!\u201d she begged.\n\n\u201cEdith,\u201d I says, hoarse in my throat, \u201cyou 've been naughty. Papa told\nyou to go to sleep, and mama told you to go to sleep. When we tell you\nto go to sleep, you've got to go to sleep. Now, this is the last time\nI'm goin' to tell you. Will you lie down and go to sleep?\u201d\n\n\u201cPapa, laim!\u201d she says, impatient.\n\nI set my mouth and lifted her up and laid her on the bed on her face and\nheld her there. She struggled and yelled.\n\n\u201cBe quiet!\u201d I says, \u201cbe quiet, or I will spank you!\u201d\n\nShe gave one long, lingerin' cry for \u201claim.\u201d\n\nI took a long breath, and lifted up my hand, and--and--I ain't a-goin'\nto tell about that. Let's go into the other room.\n\nThere set the three other grownups, holdin' their hands over their ears,\nwith pained lookin' faces. Even at that they heard the sound of a dozen\nshort, sharp claps, and the sound of the quick cries, and then there was\na silent spell, only broke by the great big sobs of the little kid in\nthe next room,--sobs that sort of exploded their way out, shakin' the\nlittle body till the crib rattled.\n\nThe sobbin' got weaker and weaker, and come further apart, and I stole\nout of the bedroom, wipin' my face with my handkerchief.\n\n\u201cI think she'll be a good girly now,\u201d says grand-daddy, gentle-like.\n\nThat baby, shocked and surprised, laid on the pillow thinkin', as much\nas a baby could think. Something cruel and unexpected had happened to\nher.\n\nMe and Marthy had turned cruel. She didn't have no one to love up to.\nShe had been hurt. Her papa dear had hurt her, because she had cried for\n\u201claim.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope she will,\u201d says Marthy in reply to grand-daddy, and that minute\nfrom the bedroom, come Deedee's voice.\n\n\u201cPapa!\u201d it pleaded.\n\nI jumped up from my chair. Evidently that child needed--\n\n\u201cPapa, kiss!\u201d says Deedee, soft and pleadin'.\n\nWell, I rather guess we all kissed her! We hugged her until she was\ngaspin' for breath, and she smiled at us, and forgive us all, even while\nthe sobs come once in a while to interfere with her smilin'.\n\n\u201cAin't she a dear, _dear_ baby?\u201d cried Marthy. \u201cPoor little thing!\u201d\n\nWhen we had loved her enough to spoil any good the spankin' had done,\nMarthy drove us out.\n\n\u201cCome, deary,\u201d she says to Deedee, \u201csay your little prayers, mama\nforgot.\u201d\n\nDeedee pressed up against her ma's knee, joyous.\n\n\u201cNow I--\u201d Marthy prompts her.\n\n\u201cNowee--\u201d says Deedee.\n\n\u201cLay me--\u201d says Marthy.\n\n\u201c_Laim_,\u201d says Deedee, tickled as you please, and then wonderin' why the\nwhole lot of us shouts out \u201cLaim!\u201d of a sudden, and why we laugh, and\ncrowd 'round her, and kiss her, and kiss her!\n\n\u201cPoor baby!\u201d says Marthy. \u201cTo be spanked for wantin' to say her\nprayers!\u201d\n\n\u201cBy George!\u201d says Uncle Edward. \u201cTalk about your martyrs! She beats the\nwhole bunch!\u201d\n\nAnd to think there was once a time when me and Marthy thought a kid was\nmore bother than it was worth! There ain't no child, nowhere, that ain't\nworth more than everything else in the world all put together. No, sir!\nA baby has got more human nature in it than a man has, even. You take\nyour big, rough hand to it, and you chastise it, so that it screams out,\nand the next minute it takes time in between sobs to hug its soft little\narms around your neck, and kiss you. Ain't that the reallest kind of\nhuman nature? Why, that's the kind that makes the world worth livin' in\nat all.\n\nI don't seem to recollect ever hearin' that Heaven was set aside as a\nsort of place where married folks could hang about by twos. Them that\nhas had experience knows that that would be a mighty poor kind of\nheaven--one without children in it. It's the child kind of human nature\nthat sweetens up the world. The \u201cgive and take\u201d kind--take your spankin'\nwhen it comes, and give back love in return for it.",
