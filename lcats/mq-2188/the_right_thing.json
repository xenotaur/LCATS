    "body": "The girl stood quiet in the cabin doorway looking out at the\nbrilliant, frosty night. Over Sugar Loaf the cold, glittering moon\nshone full; the big fir on its summit stood stark and black against\nthe vivid blue of the star-studded sky behind, like a giant sentinel\nwatching over the silent valley.\n\nBelow her, at the bottom of the little pass, the winding trail with\nits single strand of telephone wire beside it, showed plainly in the\nmoonlight. Up the mountain a wolf began howling. The girl turned back\ninto the cabin abruptly and closed the door behind her.\n\nThe supper she had been preparing was almost ready. The little board\ntable near the fireplace was set for one; over in a corner from a\nlarge, wood-burning stove came the odor of steaming coffee.\n\nThe girl put a lighted kerosene lamp upon the table and served herself\nwith a single plateful of food from the frying-pan. Once she stood\nstill, listening, but only the muffled noise of the brook and the lone\nwolf baying broke the silence. For a brief instant her glance rested\non the telephone instrument fastened to the wall beside the fireplace;\nthen, as though reassured, she sat down and began her solitary meal.\n\nA knock upon the door made her leap to her feet and stand for an\ninstant trembling. She put her hand into the pocket of her gingham\napron, her fingers gripping a little revolver that lay there. The\nknock was repeated. The girl withdrew her hand\u2014empty\u2014and with a\ntrembling smile that seemed to belittle her fear, she crossed the room\nswiftly and flung open the door.\n\nA man stood on the threshold\u2014a slim young man in a short heavy coat,\nblue flannel shirt, corduroy trousers, and neat, incongruous leather\nputtees. He was bareheaded. He stood wavering with a hand against the\ndoorway to steady himself, all his weight on one foot and the toe of\nthe other just touching the ground.\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d cried the girl. Her tone held amazement, but it was tender,\ntoo, with love. Then as she saw the pallor of his face in the\nlamplight, and his lips pressed together in a thin straight line of\npain, she cried again:\n\n\u201cTom, you\u2019re hurt!\u201d\n\nHer arms went around him, and leaning heavily on her, he hobbled\nacross the room. The pain made him moan, and he sank back in the chair\nand closed his eyes. The girl knelt on the floor beside him, and began\ngently to unstrap one of his puttees. After a moment he seemed to\nrecover a little. He sat up and wiped the sweat of weakness from his\nforehead with his coat sleeve.\n\n\u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t have stopped, Beth, but I\u2014I knew you were alone\ntonight.\u201d For an instant the drawn lines of pain left his face; his\neyes looked into the girl\u2019s tenderly.\n\nBeth looked up into his face, brushing back a wisp of hair that had\nfallen forward over her eyes. That he had come here frightened her.\nBut she was glad that he had come, and the sight of his pale face with\nthe look of pain on it made her eyes fill with tears of love and\nsympathy.\n\n\u201cWhat happened, Tom?\u201d she asked.\n\nThe boy shook himself together. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have stopped, honest,\nBeth\u2014only my horse threw me\u2014a mile back toward Rocky Gulch.\u201d He winced\nas the girl withdrew the puttee and began unlacing his shoe.\n\n\u201cOnly sprained, I guess,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it hurts like the devil\u2014and\nI\u2019m bruised all over from the fall.\u201d He laughed a little in boyish\napology for showing his pain to a girl.\n\n\u201cIt was about an hour ago. I wasn\u2019t going to stop\u2014I wanted to get to\nVailstown tonight. The horse shied at something, and bolted, and left\nme lying there. I don\u2019t know\u2014I guess I\u2019m a rotten rider.\u201d He grinned\nsheepishly.\n\nHe had come to her! Of course, it was all he could do then, without a\nhorse and with a sprained ankle at night on the Vailstown road. At the\nthought of having him here with her when he was hurt and needed her\nhelp, the girl\u2019s heart grew very loving and tender.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been an hour coming,\u201d he went on quietly\u2014he brushed her hair\nlightly with his fingers and smiled\u2014\u201cand now I\u2019m here, Beth, I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m\nsort of glad the accident happened.\u201d\n\nShe made no answer, but went on taking off his shoe and the heavy\nwoolen sock; his ankle was red and swollen. She raised his foot to a\nlow wooden bench, and he watched her silently while she filled a pail\nwith hot water. Then he noticed the food on the table.\n\n\u201cFinish eating, Beth,\u201d he said. \u201cThis can wait\u2014it doesn\u2019t hurt much\nwhen I hold it still.\u201d\n\nAgain she did not reply, but held his foot and ankle in the water a\nmoment, and then, wrapping it in an improvised bandage, replaced the\nsock. She was very tender and gentle. Once the boy made as if to kiss\nher, but she pulled away, effectually but without resentment.\nWonderment was in his eyes as he followed her swift, deft movements.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you say something, Beth?\u201d he asked after a moment. \u201cWhat\u2019s\nthe matter with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow you can eat with me,\u201d she said. She had made him as comfortable\nas possible, and returned to the stove.\n\nHe took the plate of food she handed him. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t have\nstopped, Beth\u2014but I couldn\u2019t do anything else, could I?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you know I was alone?\u201d She knew what he was going to answer,\nand it frightened her.\n\n\u201cI saw your stepfather in Rocky Gulch this afternoon\u2014no, wait, listen\nBeth\u2014I\u2019d tell you, wouldn\u2019t I, if anything had happened?\u201d\n\nHe went on impetuously, as though to dispel her rising fear.\n\n\u201cHe was drunk, Beth, and he\u2019s too old a man. Look at that\u201d\u2014he clenched\nhis fist, and the muscles of his bared forearm rose up in knots\u2014\u201cI\ncould have twisted his neck with that for what he said about me and\nyou. But I promised I wouldn\u2019t lift a hand to him, and I didn\u2019t, no\nmatter what he said. I didn\u2019t mean to meet him\u2014and then\u2014when he said\nwhat he did I\u2014well, I just listened and beat it, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nThe boy shoved his food away from him untouched, and looked across the\ntable to meet Beth\u2019s frightened eyes.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you worry, kid,\u201d he added reassuringly, \u201cI won\u2019t hurt him, and\nhe can\u2019t hurt me\u2014except with his gun.\u201d The girl shuddered, and he\nhastened to add:\n\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t do that, Beth. Don\u2019t you think it for a minute! Even when\nhe\u2019s drunk he wouldn\u2019t do that\u2014he\u2019s too much of a coward\u2014he knows he\u2019d\nswing for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe _said_ he would, Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said he would if I come up here again. I didn\u2019t come, did I?\u201d\n\nIt was a month now since her stepfather in drunken rage had ordered\nTom from the house and threatened to shoot him if he ever came there\nagain. But after all, he had to come tonight, as things happened. And\nher stepfather was away\u2014the first time he had been away in months\u2014and\nhe need never know that Tom had been here.\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t be back until tomorrow\u2014you\u2019ll be gone then,\u201d said Beth,\nvoicing her thoughts.\n\nHer words seemed to rouse the boy to sudden anger. \u201cWhy should he\nforbid my seeing you, anyway?\u201d he went on, resentfully. \u201cI love you,\nBeth, and you love me. And I want to marry you!\u201d His tone changed\nabruptly. \u201cYou _do_ love me, Beth?\u201d\n\nHe held out his arms appealingly, and in answer the girl rose silently\nand kissed him. \u201cYou know that, Tom,\u201d she said simply.\n\n\u201cThen why do I have to sneak away like a thief? Just because we love\neach other, what\u2019s that he\u2019s got against me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know why he said it was, Tom.\u201d She crossed the room again to\nattend to the stove.\n\n\u201cBecause I haven\u2019t got any money. I know\u2014that\u2019s what he said. But I\u2019ve\ngot enough to keep you as well as he does\u2014and better.\u201d He glanced\naround the cabin contemptuously. \u201cYou know that isn\u2019t the reason. It\u2019d\nbe the same, anyway\u2014unless maybe I had a fortune and would give him\nsome of it.\u201d\n\nBeth winced. It hurt, somehow, to have him say things like that. But\nshe knew it was true. And she knew, too, just how he felt\u2014how he\nresented the way he had been treated.\n\n\u201cBesides, why shouldn\u2019t I marry you?\u201d the boy went on. \u201cI\u2019m from the\nEast, same as you. I\u2019ve been to college\u2014my family\u2019s as good as\nyours\u2014for all his drunken talk\u2014better than _his_, if you ask me. What\nhe wants is to get you a rich husband back East if he can\u2019t stake a\nbig-paying claim out here. And I don\u2019t fit into that scheme. That\u2019s\nwhat\u2019s the matter, and you know it.\u201d\n\nBeth laid the coffee cups on the table and sat down again, facing him.\n\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t talk that way, Tom,\u201d she remonstrated. \u201cYou just mustn\u2019t.\nI won\u2019t listen. I\u2019ve told you that before. I can\u2019t listen to such\nthings. Why were you going to Vailstown tonight?\u201d\n\nHe ignored her question. \u201cWell, I\u2019m right, and you know it. I love\nyou, and I\u2019d make you happy. He\u2019s the only thing in the way. So far as\nyour happiness is concerned, he\u2019d be better off dead, and I wish he\nwas. Oh, I know it\u2019s a rotten thing to say, but I do. Look at that.\u201d\n\nHe leaned forward suddenly, and gripped her by the shoulder, pulling\nher toward him.\n\n\u201cYour neck\u2019s bruised black and blue. You think I don\u2019t notice things\nlike that, don\u2019t you? I know how he treats you when he\u2019s crazy\ndrunk\u2014and I\u2019m the only one who does. And I can\u2019t do anything about it\nbecause you won\u2019t let me.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom\u2014I\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd because he\u2019s your stepfather, you won\u2019t let anybody say a word\nagainst him. But you know he\u2019s no good to himself, or anybody else.\nHe\u2019d be better off dead, and you know it. Somebody\u2019ll get him one of\nthese days, too\u2014the way he acts down there at the Gulch when he\u2019s\ndrunk\u2014you wait and see. Some day they\u2019ll find him lying in a gully or\nsomething, where somebody\u2019s pushed him. He hasn\u2019t got a decent friend\nin the world\u2014only the bums are good enough for him. And that damn\nOne-Eyed Charlie he pals around with.\u201d\n\nBeth sighed hopelessly.\n\n\u201cSome day they\u2019ll find him dead down there,\u201d the boy went on.\n\u201cCharlie\u2019ll do it, maybe\u2014he\u2019s a rattlesnake anyway. And when he talks\nto me like he did today, and I see your neck horribly bruised the way\nit is now, I feel as if I could do it myself, sometimes\u2014if I had a\ngood chance.\u201d\n\nHis words shocked her, perhaps even more because some little\nwhispering devil inside said it would be better that way\u2014better for\nall three of them. She rose abruptly, and bending down, put her hands\non the boy\u2019s shoulders, looking him squarely in the face.\n\n\u201cTom, you didn\u2019t mean that,\u201d she said evenly.\n\nHis eyes shifted and avoided her own, and she felt her heart leap with\nsudden fear.\n\n\u201cWell, I feel as if I could, anyway,\u201d he answered, sullenly. \u201cAnd you\nwouldn\u2019t be sorry\u2014deep down in your heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, you can\u2019t talk this way. I won\u2019t listen. Don\u2019t you understand\u2014I\nwon\u2019t listen.\u201d\n\nShe pulled her chair close beside him. He put his arm about her\nshoulders and drew her to him hungrily.\n\n\u201cTom, why were you going to Vailstown tonight?\u201d she asked again, when\nhe had released her.\n\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d He seemed to make a sudden decision. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to tell\nyou, Beth, till I was sure.\u201d He met her searching gaze squarely. \u201cI\nthink I\u2019ve struck it, Beth\u2014over there on Cedar Creek. It looks\ngood\u2014pans richer than anything around the Gulch. I wanted to get it\nrecorded in Vailstown tonight. Then, if everything was all right, I\nwas going to phone you.\u201d\n\nHis face was flushed and eager now, and very boyish. She leaned\nforward and kissed him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad. Tom. At last\u2014you deserve it. You\u2019ve worked hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve got it, Beth\u2014got it for you, just like I said I would.\u201d\n\nBeth rose, and went to the window. \u201cIts clouding over,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have snow by morning.\u201d\n\nShe came back to the fireside, and glancing at his bandaged ankle,\nsmiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to stay here tonight. In the morning I\u2019ll walk\nover to Simpson\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s only three miles back around Sugar Loaf\u2014and get\nyou a horse. You can make it to Vailstown then.\u201d\n\nA faint, distant sound outside made them look at each other in sudden\nalarm. They listened. It grew louder\u2014a horse coming along the trail\nfrom Rocky Gulch at a gallop. Beth thought of her stepfather, perhaps\nreturning unexpectedly\u2014to find Tom here with her. In the silence she\ncould hear again the lonely howl of the wolf on Sugar Loaf\u2014a sound\nimmeasurably mournful, very much like the desolate, silent mountains\nthemselves.\n\nShe rose to her feet, trembling. The sound of the horseman approaching\ngrew steadily louder. Then her glance fell upon the little tin clock\nover the fireplace. She smiled with the relief of sudden\ncomprehension.\n\n\u201cNine o\u2019clock, Tom. I\u2019d forgotten. It\u2019s only the mail rider for\nVailstown.\u201d\n\nShe went to the window. \u201cIt\u2019s snowing, Tom,\u201d she added.\n\nTom was sitting up in his chair, tense. She wondered vaguely why he\ndid not seem relieved at her words.\n\n\u201cIt _is_ the mail,\u201d she cried, after a moment. She opened the door a\nlittle and stood looking out.\n\nThe boy started from his chair, standing upon his injured ankle\nwithout thought of it. \u201cHe may stop, Beth. He mustn\u2019t see me here. It\nwouldn\u2019t look right, don\u2019t you see\u2014it\u2014\u201d\n\nShe wheeled on him sharply. \u201cHe isn\u2019t going to stop,\u201d she said. Then\nshe flung the door wide open and stepping outside, waved her hand to\nthe passing rider on the trail below.\n\n\u201cSit down, Tom.\u201d She came back into the room and closed the door. \u201cYou\nmustn\u2019t stand on that ankle.\u201d\n\nHe sank back into the chair, his face white. \u201cGod!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cI\nshouldn\u2019t be up here with you alone tonight after\u2014after what\u2014\u201d\n\nBeth sat down again beside him. The thoughts that came to her mind\nfrightened her. She tried to dispel them, but couldn\u2019t. She put her\nhand upon his arm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve struck it, Tom,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew you would. And\nsome time\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have you for my wife,\u201d he finished. \u201cAnd take you back\nEast, maybe, where you belong.\u201d\n\nSuddenly he flung his arms about her again and kissed her upon the\nlips roughly. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing\u2014the right thing, Beth.\u201d He\nrepeated the words a little bitterly.\n\nShe disengaged herself gently.\n\n\u201cYou say \u2018the right thing,\u2019 Tom,\u201d she returned quietly, \u201cand you mean\nto be cynical. Because I\u2019ve said that to you sometimes\u2014and\u2014you never\nquite understood, did you?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why shouldn\u2019t you marry me if we love each other?\u201d he protested\nagain.\n\nHe had never understood, of course. And hadn\u2019t he the right to\nunderstand?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I meant, Tom\u2014what you have never understood\u2014never\nrealized.\u201d Her face was very earnest, very serious. \u201cYou say my\nstepfather is\u2014is no good. Well, you\u2019re right. He is no good as the\nworld judges those things\u2014and maybe as God judges them, too. But he\u2019s\nthe man my mother loved\u2014there\u2019s no getting away from that, Tom\u2014she\nloved him; and she died loving him, and with the whisper on her lips\ntelling me to help him and care for him as long as he lived.\u201d She\nlaughed\u2014a curious little laugh that seemed to catch in her throat.\n\n\u201cI never told you that, did I, Tom? I was only fourteen then\u2014but that\nday, talking there with mother, I thought out my creed\u2014my religion. To\ndo the right thing always. Tom\u2014that\u2019s it\u2014that\u2019s all there is to it.\nNot the thing that may look best for me at the time or even right for\nme\u2014but the just thing\u2014the right thing in the eyes of God.\u201d\n\nHer delicate little face grew wistful with the memories the words\nevoked. She had never spoken to Tom\u2014or to any one\u2014like this before.\nShe had hardly realized until now as she put it into words, how much\nthis simple creed of hers had come to mean to her\u2014how unconsciously\nshe had used it as her guiding star, through all these dreary,\nmournful years that followed her mother\u2019s death.\n\nShe had been unhappy, she knew; and yet not unhappy, either, since\nhappiness came with the knowledge that she was doing the right thing.\n\nAnd then Tom had come\u2014Tom with his love that had awakened hers, with\nthe promised fulfilment of all her girlish dreams. It was hard for\nTom\u2014hard for her, too, when now the right thing made them deny love.\nBut still, she had gone on trusting\u2014hoping, blindly hoping\u2014just\nwaiting for God to work it out in His own way\u2014the way that would be\nright for them all. And she was sorry now\u2014and a little frightened\u2014that\nshe had never let Tom understand.\n\nHer eyes were dim and soft with tenderness as she leaned forward\ntoward him.\n\n\u201c_That_ you can understand, Tom. It\u2019s very simple, isn\u2019t it? And don\u2019t\nyou see, that\u2019s just what father never has done. It has always been\nthe right thing as he saw it, yes\u2014but the right thing for\nhimself\u2014always the right thing for himself.\n\n\u201cAnd somehow, Tom, it doesn\u2019t seem to work out, when you only figure\nthe right thing for yourself. I don\u2019t just mean that it hurts or\nsacrifices others\u2014but somehow, some way, it don\u2019t work out for\nyou\u2014yourself. It looks all right\u2014you can\u2019t see why it isn\u2019t all right.\nBut there\u2019s something working against it\u2014some law of nature\u2014or God\nmaybe\u2014or something\u2014and it just don\u2019t work out. I believe that, Tom\u2014I\nbelieve it absolutely\u2014and\u2014and no matter how hard it is, I\u2019m trying to\nlive up to it. I promised mother that.\u201d\n\nTom moistened his dry lips. \u201cThen so long as he lives you\u2014you\u2014\u201d\n\nShe put her hand over his mouth.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t, Tom, don\u2019t. It isn\u2019t only that way\u2014it\u2019s in everything. The\nright thing always\u2014even if it looks wrong and bad for me. And I\nbelieve in the end it will work out best\u2014something we don\u2019t understand\nwill make it work out.\u201d\n\nSuddenly she slipped from her chair onto his lap, with her arms about\nhim, her head on his shoulder.\n\n\u201cBut I do love you, Tom, so very, very much.\u201d All the yearning\ntenderness of love was in her voice. \u201cI do want to be your wife\u2014some\nday\u2014when it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nThe telephone bell rang, startlingly loud in the silence of the little\ncabin. Beth pulled away from the boy and rose to her feet. That\nnameless apprehension\u2014the vague presentiment she had felt before\u2014came\nback to her now as she stood looking at the instrument, hesitating.\nThe ring was repeated\u2014a slightly different call this time, abruptly\nstilled.\n\n\u201cWhat is it, Beth? Is it for us?\u201d The telephone was silent now.\n\nShe lifted the receiver. A voice in conversation sounded in her ear;\ninstinctively she did not speak, but listened with an eager attention.\n\n\u201cDead,\u201d said the voice, \u201clying there dead, with marks on his\nthroat\u2014murder, all right.\u201d\n\nThe little cabin room went suddenly black for Beth. The noise of the\nbrook down by the trail seemed roaring in her ears; out beyond she\nheard the wolf still howling. She knew she must not faint\u2014whispered it\nbravely, despairingly to herself.\n\n\u201cBeth! Beth, what is it?\u201d The boy had started to his feet.\n\nAt the sound of his voice her head suddenly cleared. She let go of the\ntelephone box she had clutched for support, and raised her hand in\nwarning for silence. The voice in her ear was still sounding. She\nrecognized the voice now\u2014the sheriff of Rocky Gulch.\n\n\u201c\u2014hell of a scrap this afternoon,\u201d the voice was saying. \u201cIt\u2019s him all\nright\u2014only circumstantial evidence, but damn strong. And he\u2019s gone\u2014you\nknow him\u2014Tom Hawley\u2014that slim young feller from the East over at\nRansome\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThe man in Vailstown made some answer.\n\n\u201cYou send some men down the trail,\u201d the sheriff went on. \u201cHe might\ncome along any time. Probably won\u2019t. And phone Centerville\u2014or whatever\nelse you think best. You\u2019ll hear from me later-morning probably. I\ngotta ride way over now and tell his daughter\u2014I dassent phone her,\nwith her all alone out there. Hell of a job, too. Then in the morning\nwe\u2019ll get busy right.\u201d\n\nAgain the man in Vailstown spoke\u2014some question this time about\nOne-Eyed Charlie\u2014and the conversation then continued.\n\nBut Beth heard no more. The shock of this abrupt news of her\nstepfather\u2019s death, and then the suggestion of murder\u2014murder done by\nTom Hawley, the man she loved\u2014the man whose wife some day she wanted\nto be\u2014all whirled through her confused brain.\n\nTom Hawley, standing there now by the fireplace watching her\nwonderingly\u2014Tom Hawley was a murderer?\n\nThe shock of it caused a sudden revulsion in the girl\u2019s heart. Her\nfingers gripped the little revolver that lay in her apron pocket. The\nsheriff\u2019s voice was still sounding in her ear; her lips were at the\nmouthpiece\u2014she had only to speak to give Tom up\u2014a murderer whom the\nlaw demanded.\n\nAnd then something within her\u2014some tiny voice of nature\u2014whispered to\nthe girl that she loved Tom Hawley. And that he had thought it was the\nright thing to do\u2014only because he loved her\u2014because he wanted her for\nhis wife\u2014wanted to make her happy. If she gave him up he might be\nsentenced and hung. The man she loved, to be killed by the law.\n\nThe right thing! The words of her creed came back to her. Which was\nthe right thing now? Her tired brain groped at the question wearily.\nThe right thing! The words she had said to Tom flashed through her\nmind: \u201cNot the thing that may look best for me, but the right thing in\nthe eyes of God. And something\u2014some law we don\u2019t understand\u2014will make\nit work out all right.\u201d\n\nBeth dropped the telephone receiver to the end of its dangling cord\nand put her hand over the mouthpiece. Then she whirled to face the boy\nwho still stood watching her expectantly.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve found it out, Tom.\u201d Her voice came low, but vibrant and\ntense. In the hand she held outstretched a bit of polished steel\nglistened in the lamplight. \u201cThey know it\u2019s you.\u201d\n\nAt sight of the revolver she pointed at him the boy started forward.\nAmazement, incredulity were on his face.\n\n\u201cBeth! Why, Beth, what\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do the right thing, Tom\u2014the right thing in the eyes of\nGod.\u201d\n\nHe was hobbling forward, and her voice rose suddenly:\n\n\u201cTom\u2014Tom Hawley. Don\u2019t you hear me? Don\u2019t you understand?\u201d She waved\nthe revolver toward the wall nearer the telephone. \u201cStand over\nthere\u2014over there against the wall. No, I mean it\u201d\u2014as he continued\ncoming forward. \u201cNot a word now, Tom, or I\u2019ll shoot. Don\u2019t you\nunderstand? Can\u2019t you see I mean it?\u201d she ended almost with a sob.\n\nThe boy hesitated; stared into her gleaming eyes an instant, and then\ndrew himself up against the wall, silent. Holding the revolver\nleveled, Beth took her hand from the mouthpiece and lifted the\nreceiver again to her ear. The sheriff was still speaking in the\nphone.\n\n\u201cThis is Beth\u2014Beth Rollins,\u201d she interrupted. Her voice sounded almost\ncasual. She heard the sheriff\u2019s gasp of astonishment, his profane\nexclamation, and went on evenly:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been listening, Sheriff Williams. I\u2014you\u2019re looking for Tom\nHawley\u2014well, he\u2019s here\u2014here with me now. He\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s going to stay here\nuntil you come.\u201d She waited through an instant of silence, and then\nthe sheriff\u2019s voice said with seeming contrition:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m mighty sorry, Miss Beth. I was coming over to see you tonight\u2014I\nclean forgot you were on this line in the excitement. Your\nstepfather\u2014he\u2014\u201d\n\nShe interrupted his awkward, embarrassed explanation. Her brain was\nwhirling; the room was dim to her sight, with only the boy\u2019s white\nface and his questioning eyes watching her, standing out clear and\nsharp.\n\n\u201cTom Hawley\u2019s here with me,\u201d she heard her own voice repeating.\n\u201cHe\u2014he\u2019ll wait for you here.\u201d\n\nAnd then the sheriff\u2019s voice said:\n\n\u201cHell, ma\u2019m, your stepfather\u2014it didn\u2019t happen only a few minutes ago.\nIf Tom Hawley\u2019s there with you now that\u2019s all the alibi I want\u2014it\u2019s a\ncinch he wasn\u2019t here. I\u2019m mighty glad you happened to tell me tonight,\nMiss Beth, or it would of gone hard for him. You let me speak with\nhim, ma\u2019m, if he\u2019s there\u2014it must have been One-Eyed Charlie did it.\u201d\n\n                              (The End.)",
