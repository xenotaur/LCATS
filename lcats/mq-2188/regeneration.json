He was pointing down to an object lying\nhalf-buried in the soil at his feet.\n\n\"Another _death-thing_, maybe,\" Sinzor said. \"Another _'thing_ our\nancestors made with which to destroy themselves.\" He peered around the\nsemi-circle of men until he spotted the aged one with a leg missing.\n\"Morge! See that this place is marked forbidden.\" The hunting party moved\non and Morge stayed behind. He hobbled about, collecting sticks and\nstones, arranging them in the \"forbidden-symbol\" way to form a barrier\naround the _'thing_. It was because of such a _'thing_ that he'd lost a\nleg in his youth. He both hated and feared the _death-things_ his\nancestors had so carelessly left lying about before they vanished. But\nthat wasn't right. Morge scratched his grizzly old head and thought hard.\nAccording to Builder, wisest of their tribe, their ancestors hadn't all\nvanished; some of them had become the tribe--Sinzor, Builder, and even old\nMorge. Very puzzling. But it was all because of the _death-things_!\n\nPuffing, Morge completed the barrier, then turned for a last look at the\n_'thing_ gleaming dully in the pale winter sunlight. How strange it\nlooked. In no way did it resemble the usual _death-things_, most of which\nwere long and round with little wings attached. This one was different,\nlike nothing he'd ever seen before. It was boxlike with strange arms\nsticking up; and under the arms, half-buried, was a shelf or platform\nresembling vaguely the upper portion of two legs. The _'thing_ terrified\nMorge for a moment; then, in order to prove his courage to himself, he\nstepped forward and spat on it. Nothing happened. Sneering, he spat on it\nagain and watched his spittle slowly run down its side over a strange\nmarking like a thunderbolt--\n\nThunderbolt!\n\nSuddenly Morge fell grovelling to his one good knee. It was Thor, god of\nthunder and lightning and god of the tribe!\n\n_And he had spat on Thor!_\n\n\n\nFor nearly an hour he knelt there praying forgiveness for his sacrilege.\nThen, trembling, he tore off a piece of his goatskin and wiped the spittle\noff Thor's side, carefully began to uncover the remainder of Thor.\n\nFinally he lifted Thor out of the hole and onto level ground. Kneeling\nonce more, he took a small drink-scoop from his belt and placed it before\nThor. Then he pulled out his knife and folded his single leg under him;\nbending over, he cut a gash in his wrist and let the blood flow into the\nscoop until it was nearly full.\n\nRising to his knee he said, \"Oh, Thor, please take this humble offering to\nshow that I am forgiven.\" Almost prostrate now, he picked up the scoop and\nplaced it on Thor's lap beneath his arms.\n\nImmediately there was a soft rumble and humming. Fearfully old Morge\nwatched Thor's arms come down, lift up the scoop and carry it inside his\nhuge mouth. There was a sucking noise and the scoop was returned empty to\nhis lap.\n\nFilled with joy, Morge spent another endless time thanking Thor. Then all\nof a sudden an idea seized him. What if he carried Thor back to the tribe\nand presented him to the priest, Thougor, for all to worship and give\nsacrifices to? Would not he, the despised, the looked down upon, be the\ngreatest of heroes? All that was known of Thor were the legends, but at\nlast they would have the actual god!\n\nPainfully, with many grunts and groans, he got Thor under one arm and\nstaggered off towards the village, his crutch kicking up little puffs of\ndust.\n\n\n\nBuilder was having trouble with Thougor.\n\nHe almost wished now that he'd continued his search a little longer for a\nsegment of humanity. He might have found a group less primitive who would\nhave appreciated and understood his help much better. But this was the\nbest he'd found; as it was, he'd wandered over the continent nearly a\nlifetime before even finding these poor wretches. But they were at least\nhuman--something that couldn't be said for those _others_ he'd come in\ncontact with all through the past years.\n\nAnd now, after having been with the tribe--the only human tribe--for over\na year, he was being balked by this--priest! Which meant being balked at\nsetting up Truth and Knowledge as the only true gods of humanity, being\nbalked at getting the dam built before the spring rains, so that there\nwould not be another summer drouth followed by a winter of famine such as\nthey had just passed through. The dam was his first big project; without\nfreedom from want, there would be little progress next winter.\n\nAlmost savagely he turned on Thougor. \"But why must you have this\nreligious festival _now_?\"\n\n\"Because of the finding of the god Thor,\" came Thougor's cold answer.\n\n\"Why the offerings of blood? Can't they wait? The dam _must_ be finished\nbefore the rains; but the loss of blood already has so weakened the\nworkers that they can no longer work for a full day.\"\n\n\"Which is more important, worldly or spiritual things?\" Thougor replied.\n\n\"But there maybe won't be anyone around to indulge in spiritual things if\nthere's another drouth this year!\"\n\n\"Thor will see to it that there is not another drouth.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know, but wouldn't it be wiser to be on the safe side? Suppose\nsomebody does something to displease Thor?\"\n\n\"Nobody will displease Thor! It is my duty to see to that! I tell them\nwhat to think, so that they won't displease Thor.\"\n\n_A crafty devil you are_, Builder thought. _Manipulating this image of\nThor you talk about, so that it will take the blood offerings of the\npeople and even you and that half-baked discipline of yours, Morge. I must\nlook at your god Thor one of these days--_\n\nHe suddenly felt very weary and sat down on the floor; looking up at\nThougor, he said, \"But that is not part of being civilized, to tell the\npeople _what_ to think. You must _make_ them think without telling them\nwhat to think. And with the dam, next winter there will be freedom from\nwant for the first time. The tribe will have a chance to think and be on\nthe road to civilization.\"\n\n\"The tribe has already found civilization in finding Thor. By worshipping\nHim as a group they have already ceased their bickering and quarreling.\nDoes not that fit in with your definition of civilization, the one you\ngave my people when you first came to us? Since the coming of Thor we have\nbegun to cooperate, have we not?\"\n\n\"No, hardly at all. I said civilization is cooperation among men in\nadapting to environment--which includes man.\"\n\nThe two men stared at each other, and for awhile there was silence.\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" Thougor finally said, \"Thor and blood offerings continue!\"\n\n\n\nBuilder watched Thougor turn and stalk out of the tiny hovel that housed\nhis plans and his work, himself and his dreams. What could he do? He could\nonly appeal to the tribe's reason; Thougor could appeal to their emotions\nwhich were far stronger. But unless emotion was controlled, used wisely,\nthere could never be any reason.\n\nBuilder realized, with a sinking heart, that he was much too old for the\njob he'd undertaken. Too late in life had he discovered these people.\nAlmost all his energy since youth had been sapped just looking for a\nsegment of humanity. His mother and father had told him there might be\nfailure, but still they had taught him everything they could in the short\ntime before death had overtaken them. They had been the only humans living\nin that towering jungle of concrete and steel. How they had gotten there\nwas never explained to him. It didn't matter, though.\n\nSuddenly Builder shook himself. Here he was recollecting his youth instead\nof concentrating on the task at hand. He must _really_ be getting old.\n\nHe was glad of Thougor's visit. At least he was now fully aware of the\nproblem to be solved. In spite of the priest, he had to find a way of\ngetting that dam finished and soon. Or maybe next year there wouldn't be\nany people, for game was getting scarcer each winter.\n\n\n\nVery little work was done that day in spite of Builder's managing to round\nup his full crew. The blood offering each worker had given the night\nbefore had left them tired and listless. Only four of the fifty-four molds\nrunning across the river were filled with sand and gravel that morning and\nafternoon--there were still nearly fifty to be filled. Builder was very\ndepressed--\n\nBut he was even more depressed when, at the close of day, two workmen grew\ncareless and slipped into the last mold being filled; their ear-splitting\nshrieks brought half the tribe up over the hill above the village and down\nto the dam sight.\n\nAfter Builder explained what had happened, there were angry mutterings to\nthe effect that Thor was displeased with the dam and therefore had taken\nlives. Nothing Builder could say would dissuade them from this notion, so\nwell had Thougor indoctrinated them with religious fear of anything used\nto control nature. Builder hadn't realized until that moment just how much\nthe people were against the dam.\n\nThen he saw Thougor, tall and ominous in his cloak of black skins, come\nstriding through the crowd.\n\nFor a moment he stood facing them with his hands on his hips. There seemed\nto be a silent understanding between them. Slowly the crowd turned and\ndisappeared over the hill.\n\nThen Thougor strode over to Builder and said simply, \"There will be no\nmore dam.\" Turning he followed the rest of the tribe back to the village.\n\nBuilder was thunderstruck. He knew there was no use arguing or trying to\nreason with either Thougor or the tribe. It was too late for that; only\nsome drastic measure would complete the dam now.\n\nHe walked tiredly over the black hill and down to his shack, wondering how\nhe could compete with an idol. He realized now, it had been foolish of him\nto have overlooked the possible effect Thor might have upon the tribe.\nWhen it had been found three months ago, he never dreamed they would spend\nall their leisure in rituals.\n\nThe god was his problem; therefore he must get it out of the way, himself,\nwithout expecting help from anyone. Each evening the clouds on the\nnorthern horizon were darkening and drawing closer.\n\n\n\nIt was night when Builder finally stumbled into his quarters. After\nlighting a pine torch he sat down by his workbench and buried his head in\nhis hands. He was too tired and upset to eat, which was just as well--\n\nOutside of deliberately killing Thougor, there was only one thing he could\ndo--that was to kidnap Thor. With this realization, in spite of the risk\ninvolved, came some peace of mind. He hadn't the vaguest idea just how he\nwas to go about it, especially since his strength was failing him, but do\nit he would. First, though, he would have to wait until sometime before\ndawn when everybody--even Thougor--was sure to be asleep.\n\nThe hours dragged heavily between then and his chosen time. Many were the\ntimes when he longed for something to read, although he supposed that by\nthis time he'd forgotten how. Like wisps of smoke, memories of his youth\nin the concrete jungle drifted through his mind. How long ago that all\nseemed now. Sometimes he wondered if any of it had been real. But here he\nwas, as his parents had wished him to be, trying to help what was left of\nhumanity back up the trail. To what, he wondered? To destruction\nagain--this time, probably complete and final?\n\nHe shook his old head and ran a trembling hand through his white shaggy\nhair. He'd gotten this far; somehow he would get the rest of the way.\n\nBuilder got up and crossed over to his sleeping pile. After tying several\nskins together, he folded them under his arm and walked out into the\npre-dawn night. His bones felt the crackling cold of early spring as they\nhad never felt it before. Slowly he made his way around the village to\nwhere Thor was housed under a huge slanting roof of bark and scraped\nskins. He'd never seen Thor, and now wished he'd paid at least one visit\nto the god.\n\nLike a shadow he glided carefully through the blackness in back of the\ntemple until he was just inside the rear opening. He could see clear\nacross the chamber, out into the pale twinkling stars. Then he detected a\ndark mass in the center of the temple silhouetted against the stars; that\nmust be Thor.\n\nSwiftly Builder advanced towards it until his foot struck something soft,\ncausing him to stumble and fall. As he did so, he heard a grunt sounding\nlike someone being kicked in the stomach--\n\nThen something was on top of him, pounding his head and shoulders with a\nheavy stick of some kind. Old Builder knew he didn't have the strength to\nwrestle; he managed to get his pile of skins unfolded and, with his last\nounce of strength, throw them over the head of his attacker. Somehow he\nmanaged to wiggle out from underneath and climb to his feet. His assailant\nbegan to scream for help, but the heavy skins muffled his shouts.\n\nQuickly Builder looked around for something to hit him with. The only\nthing his eye spotted was the idol. He hobbled over and, using both arms,\ndragged it off its dias. Then, with the remainder of his strength, dropped\nit squarely on top of whomever was under the skins. There was a muted\nclunk followed by silence.\n\nFearfully Builder stood there for a moment catching his breath and\nlistening for anyone coming. All was quiet except the pounding of his\nheart.\n\nAs fast as he could make his arms and hands work he rolled up the body in\nthe skins and painfully hoisted it over one shoulder. With his other hand\nhe reached down and picked Thor up by one of its arms, then, staggering\nunder the load, he started back the way he had come.\n\nExcept for a greyish streak in the east, it was still dark. He stumbled\nand fell several times before reaching his dwelling, but he was confident\nthat he had left no tracks. Every night, even this late in the winter, the\nground froze solid.\n\n\n\nBack inside his shed, still in the dark, Builder unrolled his burden and\nlistened for any heartbeat. There was none. As he rolled the body up\nagain, something clattered to the floor. It was a crutch. Quickly he felt\nfor his victim's legs; one was missing. Of all the people he had to\nkill--Morge! Thougor's right hand man.\n\nHe realized he had to get rid of the body before daylight and fast!\nAlready more grey was lining the eastern horizon.\n\nHe didn't know whether he had the strength to do it or not, but he had to\nget Morge up to the dam and into one of the unfilled molds. For the time\nbeing he would have to hide Thor someplace inside here. He couldn't carry\nboth of them up to the dam.\n\nHe rolled the idol up in another set of skins and placed it under the head\nof his sleeping pile. Then, picking up his other bundle once more, he\nstarted for the dam.\n\n\n\nThe sun was just peeking over the horizon when Builder finally stumbled\nback into his dwelling and into bed.\n\nAll that day, he lay there, body on fire with fever, and heart pounding\nlike a drum. He was almost certain he would soon die. \"It was just as\nwell,\" a little corner of his consciousness said. At least he would be\nmissing all the frenzied excitement of Thor's disappearance along with\nMorge.\n\nBut it looked as though he had failed after all. In spite of removing the\ngod, now he was dying--and the dam still unfinished.\n\nThe day dragged on and on and he didn't die.\n\nAfter waking up in late afternoon he felt better. He ate a handful of nuts\nand figs washed down with a little herb tea. Then as night crept over the\nsky, he tottered down to the village.\n\nWhatever had taken place during the day was done, and little groups of\npeople stood around fires resting and talking--as though it were the old\ndays before the coming of Thor, thought Builder. That was good.\n\nBuilder moved in closer to one of the fires to warm himself against the\nearly spring night. Someone recognized him--it was one of his workers--and\nhe was suddenly made welcome, once again being given the place of honor\nnearest the fire, as in the old days when he'd first discovered the\nhumans.\n\nBuilder was dumbfounded at the sudden cordiality. In recent days, Thougor\nhad done such a good job of discrediting, he never dreamed of regaining\nhis old standing.\n\nThen he was told what had happened during the day while he lay almost\ndying:\n\nWhen the god and Morge were discovered missing, Thougor had called the\nvillage together, explaining that Thor had left them, taking Morge as a\nsacrifice because he was dissatisfied with the tribe's paltry blood\nofferings and worship. Therefore a great death sacrifice of young men and\nwomen must be undertaken to pacify Thor and cause his return.\n\nBut the people questioned Thougor's order; they seemed to feel it was the\npriest who had been at fault, not themselves. After all, he was the\nclosest to Thor, was he not? Therefore it was Thougor, not the village,\nthat Thor had become angered at. And after holding quick council, they had\ndriven Thougor out into the wilderness, telling him he was not to return\nunless Thor was with him.\n\nOld Builder almost cried when he heard this joyful news. The dam would be\ncompleted after all, he was almost certain. He decided to say nothing more\nabout religion, Thor or Thougor. Maybe soon they would forget the whole\nthing. Now he could go back to teaching the youngsters and some of the\nbrighter oldsters the methods of writing in symbols instead of drawing\npictures.\n\n\n\nHours and days turned into weeks and months as Builder taught his people\nwhat feeble knowledge he possessed in arithmetic, simple engineering--such\nas the dam--and most of all, instilling in them the will to want to learn\nand investigate and question anything they came in contact with--even the\nvery thing he was asking them to do.\n\nAs the weeks passed on and the dam was completed, he gradually gathered\naround him an ardent little group of seeker after that most elusive of all\nthings--\"Truth\".\n\nBut Builder knew that his days were numbered now, and his work completed;\nthere was still one thing he had to do, and that was permanently to do\naway with Thor by dropping the idol to the bottom of the dam; he still\nhadn't examined the god hidden under his sleeping pile.\n\nOne evening after returning from a solitary walk above the dam, he entered\nhis shack and lit a torch, then almost dropped it from shock!\n\nHis dwelling was a wreck. The place had been ransacked from top to bottom.\nHis sleeping pile lay in the middle of the floor--the idol was gone!\n\nHe turned and fled from the room, but before he could take a dozen steps\ntowards the village, several shadows glided out from behind trees and\nrocks in the moonlight, resolving themselves into men.\n\nBefore he could cry out or struggle, strong arms pinned his arms to his\nbody and someone clapped a dirty hand over his mouth. He was forced back\ninto his hovel and the door slammed shut. Standing in front of him was a\nvery bedraggled figure whom he recognized as Thougor. He also recognized\nhis three other captors; all were elderly reactionaries of the tribe who\nhad disapproved of him from the beginning. In spite of his predicament\nBuilder felt a warm glow of happiness course through him. If these were\nthe only cronies Thougor could round up, that meant the rest of the\nvillagers were sympathetic with his cause. He suddenly became aware of\nThougor's grating voice:\n\n\"It took me a little time to piece things together, but once I did, it\ndidn't take me long to come back and find the god where I might have at\nfirst suspected it would be--right here! For your sacrilege you will pay\nwith every last drop of blood you have in your scrawny old body--and now!\"\nWhereupon Thougor disappeared out of the hovel.\n\nSomehow Builder had known they were going to kill him before arousing the\nrest of the tribe to the fact that Thor was back. Thougor was taking no\nchances of his standing in the way of him or Thor ever again. But Builder\ndidn't care: he had sown his few seeds of knowledge and wisdom well.\nAlthough Thougor didn't know it, this time he wouldn't have complete\nhomage from all the tribe. There would now be doubts and questionings and\ntests for both Thor and Thougor in the ways of truth and righteousness.\n\nThen Thougor returned to the shack with what, Builder thought, must be\nThor. The hand over his mouth had twisted his head back so that he only\ngot a glimpse, but he didn't miss the long knife Thougor pulled from\nbeneath his tattered skins, nor the large sacrificial bowl one of the\nothers held below his neck. Then his head was tilted forward and sidewise,\nand he got his first full look at the god Thor. At the sight, his whole\nbody shook with smothered laughter. Below the two arms and etched\nthunderbolt were large block letters standing out in bold relief:\n\n                                 _THOR_\n                         _ Automatic Dishwasher_\n                          _ Atomic Powered 1999_",
