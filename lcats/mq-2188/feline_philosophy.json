Shutters\n  They put on the house and the keys\n  Are turned in the locks. The silver\n  Was put in the vault and everything\n  Valuable carefully stowed....\n                                Little Jack\n  Looked well for me. But when he found me\n  Was told to put me outside; a cat has no\n  Place in a house that is closed for\n  The summer.\n              When they were sorely troubled\n  With rats and mice they coaxed me to\n  Come to live in the cellar. They fed\n  Me richly on cream and the choicest\n  Bits from their lavish table. They gave\n  Me a rug to sleep, and taught the children\n  To pet me. All took turns to feed me and\n  They saved the bones of each fish.\n                                    The\n  Mice and rats disappeared; the rug\n  Is filthy, in tatters. Old Horton curses\n  And kicks me and kicks me down stairs when he\n  Meets me; warns the baby to heed my\n  Claws and the older children that\n  Cats breed all sorts of diseases. Edith\n  Has young men to call and \"cannot abide\n  The cat that is covered with ashes.\"\n  Only Jack remembers--which reminds me\n  How well I was treated. I was young when\n  They found me and now have grown wise in\n  Their councils.\n                I have no food and no\n  Lodging.\n\n\n\n\nSECOND CATERWAUL\n\n\n  It's more than a week since I've eaten\n  And my bed is made in the gutter. Well-fed\n  And beggars go by and their boots are\n  All alike ready as soon as they spy me.\n  Jack Horton went by with his father and\n  Stooped to whisper his secret. Old Horton\n  Jerked his arm and urged that he'd miss\n  The train. So even railroad time\n  Seems relentless as the procession\n  Passes over and about me. Between buying\n  A new suit for his party\n  And his affection\n  Even young Jack had no choice.\n  Now I have to hunt\n  And I've eaten a sparrow for breakfast.\n  I ate with infinite relish\n  Though I never ate one before;\n  I was starved and the murder and crime\n  Were lost in my terrible necessity.\n  My depravity is beginning to wear....\n  I shall wander down to the river....\n  I have heard Jack's father say:\n  When a man falls so low as that\n  He had better drown himself than--\n  I've forgotten the rest; I cannot think\n  In my present state of mind.\n\n\n\n\nTHIRD CATERWAUL\n\n\n  Arrived at the wharf there was not\n  Another soul in sight ... except at the very end\n  Where sat a most woebegone looking Tramp\n  Smoking what was once a cigar\n  Of price. Half smoked it had been thrust\n  In the gutter at the theater-entrance\n  By a careless and prosperous merchant.\n  The Tramp was very near to the edge looking out\n  Over the water as blankly as a blind man.\n  A man! Look at him ... and I a mere cat!\n  No doubt Old Horton was right.... One leap\n  Into the darkness and all gloomy thoughts,\n  All trouble, like the half-finished cigar\n  Would give place to beautiful dreams and\n  Never-ending.... At least it cannot be much\n  Worse.... No! Far better than the foul gutter\n  And the murderous cravings for the unattainable.\n  I shall burst my bonds and jump in.\n\n\n\n\nFOURTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  It gave a terrible fright when I struck\n  The water. Even in filth and mud I found it more\n  Pleasure to swim than to drown. How comfortable\n  The gutter now seemed but my strength was\n  Utterly useless.... My thoughts had been\n  Less overwhelming than the murky slime that\n  Would kill me ... and to sink, to be swallowed\n  By fishes that had been sweet food for my palate.\n  A boat came out of the darkness and a brown\n  Arm folded me up from the last gasp in the river.\n  It was going out to a yacht and the mate was the\n  Man who rescued: \"What luck with our rats and mice\n  To find this bedraggled feline.... Maggie can give\n  It some milk and the Master won't curse for the\n  Vermin....\"\n                Perhaps I was born as an antidote!\n  Perhaps I have no choice what to do!\n  But whatever may be I shall at least do\n  What is expected, the best that I can--\n  How else can I expect anything?\n\n\n\n\nFIFTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  Did you ever see a palace in a desert?\n  Ralph Dimon was a good catch and Irene's\n  Father was very rich. Low necked dress,\n  Dress clothes, lace, jewelry, curtains of\n  Fine brocade, mahogany panellings and\n  Nickel-mountings dimmed the lights of Brough's\n  Yacht and were more plentiful than the drops\n  Of water that had nearly drowned me.\n  As I was lifted over the side I saw the\n  Two lovers lounging in the bow where there\n  Were no lights; while inside the electric\n  Lamps burned neglected. The wind blew a gale\n  And I shivered; but comfortable surroundings\n  And even diamonds would warm anybody but a\n  Half drowned cat....\n                          I wonder if pink ribbons\n  And a silver-mounted collar would have made\n  Me warmer or less hungry ... and I was most\n  Interested because Irene's father never paid\n  His bills without a lawsuit.... Perhaps I might\n  With ribbon and collar have had food for the asking.\n  But an honest cat must be kicked around\n  The kitchen by Maggie. Maggie was used to it:\n  \"Haven't you better sense than to bring such\n  Rubbish aboard, Jim? Old Brough will miss the\n  Milk and there'll be the devil to pay.\"--And\n  To think how I could rid this palace of vermin....\n  But that would cost Father Brough money and\n  It wouldn't show....\n  Jim put me ashore ... but I was grateful!\n\n\n\n\nSIXTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  What a terrible contrast: from an interrupted\n  Yachting trip to the garbage can! The smell\n  Of the sea is sweeter but I wasn't dressed\n  For it.... The lure of a square meal is sweeter\n  Than the glitter of paste.\n                            Think of finding a\n  Half beefsteak on top of the can! There was no\n  Gravy but it was cooked to perfection. I ate it\n  With relish, but should have enjoyed it better\n  If only some one would let me work for it--\n  Especially such a meal.... And yet they say beggars\n  Cannot be choosers.... I found a lot more in the can\n  To eat, but the steak satisfied me.\n  I was very tired; so I went to sleep beside the\n  Can....\n      When the collector came he took counsel of\n  My presence and hunted through to see what he could\n  Find of value. He looked up and down the street\n  And then slipped a half-roasted-chicken into his\n  Blouse; but not before casting me a look of\n  Triumph.... But I never can eat two meals at a\n  Sitting and chicken doesn't agree with me. Then,\n  Too, even honey is nourishing, but it may give\n  One indigestion.... I hope he enjoyed the chicken\n  As much as I did my banquet....\n                                Why, thought I, not\n  Offer to stay in this house where plenty runs\n  To overflowing....\n                        It proved to be Brough's!\n\n\n\n\nSEVENTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  I prefer the street and the gutter\n  To the hospitality Brough's might have offered.\n  How lucky to be a cat\n  Free to accept or--refuse\n  What is offered!\n\n\n\n\nEIGHTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n                      I found a door that was open.\n  The grass in the entry was cut close;\n  The hangings and drawing-room furniture\n  Immaculate in their smug neatness. Even the\n  Windows were clean and the books on the\n  Shelves were well dusted. I wandered into\n  The kitchen where oilcloth was spotless\n  And tidy. Even the walls were fresh-papered....\n  No doubt to keep the kalsomine-water\n  From evaporating....\n                            Table-manners in such\n  A house, I fear, are more real than the eating.\n  I turned about and went out lest the hairs\n  In my coat might scatter.\n\n\n\n\nNINTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  I have been housed with Jerolamon Jones\n  And his wife, whom they call \"tame cat,\"\n  For what seems a fairly long time. Jerry\n  They call him for short and short is the Bible\n  He reads. Lovers they are to the world and\n  To each other still more--for that is the\n  Judgment that counts.... Jerry has nights\n  \"At the club\" and loves his dear wife's\n  Friends. She can always reach him by 'phone\n  But she wouldn't do it for worlds as she\n  Trusts him beyond cavil or guile....\n  And the tame cat sits on the laps of a\n  Dozen or more of his friends--but only\n  When Jerry is home.\n                        I followed Jerry one night\n  But his club was not where he went....\n  We came home exactly at twelve--and Marion\n  (That was his wife) was fast asleep in the sheets.\n  Fulton had kissed her that night--and of course\n  She told Jerry next day.... He trusted his wife\n  As she him....\n                  They were playing the game\n  When I left--I left because only I\n  Knew how to end the farce!\n\n\n\n\nTENTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  I have wandered over the city aimless and homeless,\n  Hungered in mind and in body.\n  Days are not irksome in sunshine\n  And rain promises more when it ceases.\n  But the nights are so intimate\n  And the rays of one's mind\n  Are perlucid.\n  Like a criminal tracing his steps\n  Back to the scene of iniquity,\n  I found myself in Horton's neighborhood....\n  But the house was still closed for the summer.\n\n\n\n\nELEVENTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  Mrs. Horton's maid, Alice, came home\n  With the keys. She left the window open\n  When she went to the corner for food.\n  I took unfair advantage--thus experience has taught me--\n  Climbed in at the first opportunity.\n  I hid in her bedroom--the only door that was open.\n  After all I had suffered\n  Perhaps Jack would come back\n  And then my troubles be over.\n  For the first time in months\n  I slept without fear and in comfort....\n  It must have been after midnight\n  When Old Horton came in. It was pitch dark\n  So he couldn't see me. It gave me uncanny pleasure\n  To follow him. He stole up to Alice's room\n  As if a hundred were watching. The door remained\n  Gaping to the empty house and--me.\n  Presently Alice screamed and the harrowing sound\n  Frightens me even now.\n  Horton went back to his room\n  And the house resumed its stillness.\n  I sat on the floor by his bed\n  Lulled by his heavy breathing....\n  Out of the darkness there gleamed\n  A flash from the crack of a pistol.\n  Alice was fully dressed and quietly turned on her heel;\n  Left the house by the basement; walked to the corner\n  And river; threw something deep in its water; then back\n  To the house where she'd killed him--\n  Leaving the front door open.... I followed her up to her room\n  Where she undressed and went back to bed....\n  Dead in his they found Horton,\n  And on his tomb they inscribed:\n\n  \"A LOVING FATHER AND DEVOTED HUSBAND.\"\n\n\n\n\nTWELFTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  I've been sitting in the gutter and wondering--\n  Strange dreams come to me in strange places--\n  The glare of approaching motor\n  Bewildered my thoughts still more.\n  I saw stranger things in the shadows\n  Than the glow of the lights revealed.\n  And the deepest shadows\n  Close behind the gleaming arcs of the motor\n  Showed heads that were snuggled close.\n  Edith Horton was one\n  And Brough--who is married--the other.\n  No matter how dark the night its shame is refulgent\n  To Heaven.\n  The chain of my reverie was broken\n  As the lash will draw blood from the purest....\n  And yet I am only a cat that was nearly\n  Run over!\n\n\n\n\nTHIRTEENTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  Jack Horton has taken me back--\n  His father's boots are now mouldy.\n  Edith does charity work and teaches in\n  Sunday-school. Brough is the superintendent....\n  The mortgage on Mallory's house\n  Was foreclosed on Saturday morning.\n  Mallory, wife and six children\n  Were sitting out on the street,\n  Their shabby trappings about them....\n  A syndicate bought the house\n  From Brough--his profit was ten thousand dollars.\n  Brough is rolling in wealth.\n  But Mallory now and Brough\n  Will seem to me much more alike:\n  Neither will pay his bills.\n  ... But Jack is kind to me\n  And Brough's not the milk\n  That I drink!\n\n\n\n\nFOURTEENTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  When Mallory worked in the shops\n  He drank up the wages he earned.\n  Now that he's out of a job\n  He's docile and kind to his wife\n  And dawdles the baby all day.\n  Old Horton used to say that Mallory\n  Was a good mechanic and a bad father.\n  Thus do critics fall out--Now that Old Horton\n  Is dead\n  He could not reverse his opinion\n  Nor the marble slab on his grave.\n  Joe Mallory was always Jack's chum; so Jack got after\n  His friends.... Now he's delighted and proud\n  For he found Mallory a job\n  Which Mallory thoroughly liked and took\n  For the price of giving up drink.\n\n\n\n\nFIFTEENTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  Edith was reading the paper\n  Breakfasting on the couch\n  At the foot of which I sat.\n  Her face was as pale as a ghost.... She read\n  Something twice out loud:\n  \"James Brough in the Bankruptcy Court.\n  Squandered his fortune on women;\n  Many society girls in his net.\"\n  She fainted just as her mother came in; so I\n  Quietly left the room....\n                      And yet there is now a law\n  That the lamps of motors be dimmed!\n\n\n\n\nSIXTEENTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  Jack and his older brother went to the wharf\n  As Ralph Dimon is going abroad.\n  He's going to stay for some time....\n  Irene's been released\n  From a very long engagement.\n  Not only for mourning it seems\n  That weddings are postponed.\n  Irene looks dejected and weary--\n  She came to see Edith this morning.\n  The two are off for the mountains together....\n  They say Ralph was richer than Brough.\n\n\n\n\nSEVENTEENTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  They are sending Jack to boarding-school--\n  He debated long should he take me?\n  If only I were a dog!--but grown boys\n  Don't make pets of cats....\n  He doesn't know why he's going away--\n  But I do: Alice, the maid, is in trouble\n  And Mrs. Horton is shocked--and doesn't\n  Want Jack to know.\n\n\n\n\nEIGHTEENTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  Ever since Jack went away\n  Mrs. Horton has looked after me.\n  The day he left\n  She came to the window\n  And threw out Old Horton's boots.\n  At first I thought they were thrown\n  At me--but it seems that she threw them\n  Wide of the window!\n  When I voiced my surprise\n  She hurried to me and now\n  I sleep on her divan!\n\n\n\n\nNINETEENTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  Clarence Horton, Jerolamon Jones and a few\n  Of the other young bloods had a party last night--\n  Hunt breakfast they called it, I think.\n  They started by talking of dogs--hounds and\n  Horse-flesh and mounts. I gathered that sort of sport\n  Leaves all the toil to the dogs\n  And the glory and brush to the hunter.\n  For this kind of thing\n  They were well fit--\n  And none of them went home too sober!\n\n\n\n\nTWENTIETH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  Mrs. Horton sent Alice away--she left last night\n  After dark.\n  It was better the neighbors\n  Shouldn't see!\n  There was no reason therefore\n  To send poor Jack away!--\n  Perhaps it was just as well?\n  Mrs. Horton wouldn't have Alice around\n  Lest it embarrass Edith and--her....\n  I followed Alice some way and she seemed\n  Quite cheerful enough.\n  Waiting is much the same\n  No matter what one expects.\n\n\n\n\nTWENTY-FIRST CATERWAUL\n\n\n  Brough is through with the Courts\n  And continues to ride in his car.\n  He called for Edith last night\n  When Mrs. Horton was out--she had gone\n  To the hospital where Alice was\n  Supposed to have gone....\n                          Brough's chauffeur\n  Isn't paid but it's the only way to get what\n  One wants--to keep right on\n  Especially when fishing for eels!\n  Brough is a financier--the rest of us\n  Only fish!\n\n\n\n\nTWENTY-SECOND CATERWAUL\n\n\n  In my morning stroll I found\n  The Jerolamon Jones' door stood open;\n  I looked about and went in\n  But received a scanty welcome--\n  Indeed I was promptly chased out\n  By the maid.\n  This afternoon Mrs. Jones called\n  To beg Mrs. Horton\n  To loan her the valuable cat\n  As the maid had discovered\n  A mouse.\n  Thus do values increase\n  And appreciation follow apace!\n\n\n\n\nTWENTY-THIRD CATERWAUL\n\n\n  The maid that had chased me out\n  Fondled me as she carried me over\n  Till my fur bristled....\n                            The mice have\n  Disappeared--I finished as luncheon was served,\n  And sat by the serving-table.\n  But the Joneses all ate so much\n  That I wasn't even noticed--and when I was,\n  They sent me back to the Horton's\n  At once....\n              Mrs. Horton fed me herself!\n\n\n\n\nTWENTY-FOURTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  I saw the maid, Alice, last night;\n  She was wandering near the bright lights\n  And the carnivorous shadows--Shadows\n  That burned to my soul as I saw her\n  Speak to a man. They went down the street\n  Together, the veil of darkness hid them,\n  And when I got home Mrs. Horton\n  Was telling a friend that \"Alice\n  Was lost beyond any redemption; at any rate\n  She herself could no longer help!\"--\n  What problems beset our family!\n\n\n\n\nTWENTY-FIFTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  Jack was home for Christmas\n  But I saw him hardly at all--\n  To the front door he now has a key\n  And the hours he keeps are quite varied.\n  One morning he slept very late\n  And the name that he spoke in his dreams\n  Was \"Alice.\"\n  Mrs. Horton was proud of her son and the party\n  She gave him was sumptuous.\n\n\n\n\nTWENTY-SIXTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  We have a new cook at the Horton's\n  Who saves the bean water for soup....\n  I've enjoyed such broth at the Mallory's,\n  But at the Horton's!!!--\n  And their bills are always as large\n  As before Bridget was installed.\n  But Edith and Mrs. Horton are pleased\n  And the baby and I can't complain!!\n\n\n\n\nTWENTY-SEVENTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  There's a new baby at the Mallory's\n  And the rest of the children are pleased;\n  Mallory and his wife are as happy as larks....\n  Edith Horton has a toy Angora\n  And Mrs. Horton has forgotten me--\n  Indeed she has put me out....\n  Again I must wander the streets!\n\n\n\n\nTWENTY-EIGHTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  I followed Alice last night\n  Down to her alley and room--\n  She stooped as she entered her door\n  And petted me much as she used to....\n  Then she cuddled her baby and seemed\n  Far fonder of it than Mrs. Horton of hers\n  And nearly as much\n  As Edith of her angora....\n\n\n\n\nTWENTY-NINTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  I sat on the curb at the corner\n  Just outside the saloon\n  Where politics rule and\n  Presidents are made and unmade.\n  Two men were discussing the War....\n  And when they were through, the conclusion\n  Was discussion untempered by argument....\n  Unconvinced I went on my way.\n\n\n\n\nTHIRTIETH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  All afternoon I sat in the shade\n  Of a hideous skyscraper\n  On the Avenue.\n  Women of all sorts went by\n  And their footgear and stockings\n  Were varied.\n  Skirts that our grandmothers used\n  To clothe five- and ten-year-old girlies\n  Revealed twelve inches of hose--\n  Nor the three-shade boots that shod them\n  Would help a Chinaman guess\n  The age of the wearers who proudly\n  Boasted this awful foundation....\n  And yet are most of the women\n  Sweet-souled and modest....\n  I polished my claws once again!\n\n\n\n\nTHIRTY-FIRST CATERWAUL\n\n\n  I looked in at the restaurant window\n  Through which gleamed a medley of color--\n  Diamonds, pearl pendants and rubies,\n  And ruby and gold was the wine\n  Blazing first in glasses rich-stemmed,\n  Then blazoned bright in the glances\n  Of women;\n  Some with their husbands and fathers,\n  Others leering and brazen--\n  But my milk tasted sweeter\n  Next morning, for to the poor\n  All things are pure!\n\n\n\n\nTHIRTY-SECOND CATERWAUL\n\n\n  I hadn't eaten for hours\n  And all the house doors were shut--\n  The heat of the sun was oppressive\n  So I languished in the shade,\n  Though my appetite was appalling....\n  Beside there were plenty of sparrows\n  Ready to eat when I chose to....\n  But when the sun was gone,\n  So were the sparrows!\n\n\n\n\nTHIRTY-THIRD CATERWAUL\n\n\n  The Mallorys have taken me in....\n  Mallory says: one more to feed....\n  But the children like it to play\n  And it looks like Horton's old cat\n  So it's certain to be a good one....\n  Even if discarded.\n\n\n\n\nTHIRTY-FOURTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  Mrs. Mallory read from the paper\n  Where wise ones answer fool's queries\n  And this was one of the questions:\n  Is it possible a woman\n  Who has bitten her nails all her life\n  Since first she had teeth\n  Could so cause her baby\n  The affliction of two thumbs on one hand?...\n  Did they ever think that of cats?\n\n\n\n\nTHIRTY-FIFTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  If we really had nine lives,\n  None akin to the others\n  And all the hopes of each life\n  Were answered in the next,\n  Perhaps a cat's existence would\n  Still be unsatisfactory?\n\n\n\n\nTHIRTY-SIXTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  Joe Mallory told Jack about Alice--\n  At least of her fate.\n  Jack found her address\n  And wanted to help....\n  And yet there are some\n  Who believe heredity infallible!\n\n\n\n\nTHIRTY-SEVENTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  While Jack tried to smother\n  Alice's wild burning fires\n  Joe never obtruded--\n  But when Jack was not watching\n  Joe brought more wood\n  To the kindling....\n  Still they were friends.\n\n\n\n\nTHIRTY-EIGHTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  You should have read Brough's\n  Obituary....

I wonder\n  What I repent?--or is it only\n  Regret?\n\n\n\n\nFORTY-FOURTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  All my life I have studied\n  The passerby-faces\n  And known them....\n  Sometimes they noticed me;\n  Others more often seemed\n  Unconscious I saw them.\n  I wondered what they were thinking....\n  Or had they no thoughts\n  But like wax that responds\n  To momentary impressions?\n  I'm sure I read all the faces....\n  Did I know them--\n  Except when they kicked me\n  Or petted?\n\n\n\n\nFORTY-FIFTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  At last I have to confess\n  That all my judgment is blinded!\n  Jack and Joe are now partners,\n  Croesus and Job united\n  In one homogeneous effort....\n  And yet my kind make nights hideous\n  By howling continuous calamity!\n\n\n\n\nFORTY-SIXTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  Now that the Mallorys have money\n  They haven't changed the brand\n  Of my milk nor their butcher.\n  They wear more clothes\n  And better; but they still\n  Continue to pet me.\n\n\n\n\nFORTY-SEVENTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  Joe sent Pat Mallory through college;\n  Up there Pat says that his father\n  Is Superintendent of power--\n  Old Mallory's just a plain foreman--\n  But Pat still with reason\n  Differs\n  From the verdict given by Horton,\n  For Pat still worships his father,\n  And still calls me\n  Poor old Cat....\n\n\n\n\nFORTY-EIGHTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  I heard Pat talking of college--\n  Some of Pat's friends have been visiting--\n  I wondered what they were learning!\n  Pat is surely improving.\n  Still Joe would always have prospered\n  In or out of a college--\n  And yet I shall always be\n  Just a cat.\n\n\n\n\nFORTY-NINTH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  I've watched in the rain and snow\n  Sunshine and cloudy weather\n  For any change in my spirit;\n  But whether I've eaten a fish\n  Or had just a drink of milk,--\n  Only that I found made\n  A difference.\n\n\n\n\nFIFTIETH CATERWAUL\n\n\n  Go on with your work--\n  Patient Stranger!\n  I've told you enough of my\n  Wanderings.\n  The Mallorys are troubled with mice\n  And never close house for the summer!",
