    "body": "\nESTABLISHING RELATIONS\n\nMr. Richard Catesby, second officer of the ss. _Wizard_, emerged from the\ndock-gates in high good-humour to spend an evening ashore.  The bustle of\nthe day had departed, and the inhabitants of Wapping, in search of\ncoolness and fresh air, were sitting at open doors and windows indulging\nin general conversation with any-body within earshot.\n\nMr. Catesby, turning into Bashford's Lane, lost in a moment all this life\nand colour.  The hum of distant voices certainly reached there, but that\nwas all, for Bashford's Lane, a retiring thoroughfare facing a blank dock\nwall, capped here and there by towering spars, set an example of\ngentility which neighbouring streets had long ago decided crossly was\nimpossible for ordinary people to follow.  Its neatly grained shutters,\nfastened back by the sides of the windows, gave a pleasing idea of\nuniformity, while its white steps and polished brass knockers were\nsuggestive of almost a Dutch cleanliness.\n\nMr. Catesby, strolling comfortably along, stopped suddenly for another\nlook at a girl who was standing in the ground-floor window of No. 5.  He\nwent on a few paces and then walked back slowly, trying to look as though\nhe had forgotten something.  The girl was still there, and met his ardent\nglances unmoved: a fine girl, with large, dark eyes, and a complexion\nwhich was the subject of much scandalous discussion among neighbouring\nmatrons.\n\n\"It must be something wrong with the glass, or else it's the bad light,\"\nsaid Mr. Catesby to himself; \"no girl is so beautiful as that.\"\n\nHe went by again to make sure.  The object of his solicitude was still\nthere and apparently unconscious of his existence.  He passed very slowly\nand sighed deeply.\n\n\"You've got it at last, Dick Catesby,\" he said, solemnly; \"fair and\nsquare in the most dangerous part of the heart.  It's serious this time.\"\n\nHe stood still on the narrow pavement, pondering, and then, in excuse of\nhis flagrant misbehaviour, murmured, \"It was meant to be,\" and went by\nagain.  This time he fancied that he detected a somewhat supercilious\nexpression in the dark eyes--a faint raising of well-arched eyebrows.\n\nHis engagement to wait at Aldgate Station for the second-engineer and\nspend an evening together was dismissed as too slow to be considered.  He\nstood for some time in uncertainty, and then turning slowly into the\nBeehive, which stood at the corner, went into the private bar and ordered\na glass of beer.\n\nHe was the only person in the bar, and the land-lord, a stout man in his\nshirt-sleeves, was the soul of affability.  Mr. Catesby, after various\ngeneral remarks, made a few inquiries about an uncle aged five minutes,\nwhom he thought was living in Bashford's Lane.\n\n\"I don't know 'im,\" said the landlord.\n\n\"I had an idea that he lived at No. 5,\" said Catesby.\n\nThe landlord shook his head.  \"That's Mrs. Truefitt's house,\" he said,\nslowly.\n\nMr. Catesby pondered.  \"Truefitt, Truefitt,\" he repeated; \"what sort of a\nwoman is she?\"\n\n\"Widder-woman,\" said the landlord; \"she lives there with 'er daughter\nPrudence.\"\n\nMr. Catesby said \"Indeed!\" and being a good listener learned that Mrs.\nTruefitt was the widow of a master-lighterman, and that her son, Fred\nTruefitt, after an absence of seven years in New Zealand, was now on his\nway home.  He finished his glass slowly and, the landlord departing to\nattend to another customer, made his way into the street again.\n\nHe walked along slowly, picturing as he went the home-corning of the\nlong-absent son.  Things were oddly ordered in this world, and Fred\nTruefitt would probably think nothing of his brotherly privileges.  He\nwondered whether he was like Prudence.  He wondered----\n\n\"By Jove, I'll do it!\"  he said, recklessly, as he turned.  \"Now for a\nrow.\"\n\nHe walked back rapidly to Bashford's Lane, and without giving his courage\ntime to cool plied the knocker of No. 5 briskly.\n\nThe door was opened by an elderly woman, thin, and somewhat querulous in\nexpression.  Mr. Catesby had just time to notice this, and then he flung\nhis arm round her waist, and hailing her as \"Mother!\" saluted her warmly.\n\nThe faint scream of the astounded Mrs. Truefitt brought her daughter\nhastily into the passage.  Mr. Catesby's idea was ever to do a thing\nthoroughly, and, relinquishing Mrs. Truefitt, he kissed Prudence with all\nthe ardour which a seven-years' absence might be supposed to engender in\nthe heart of a devoted brother.  In return he received a box on the ears\nwhich made his head ring.\n\n\"He's been drinking,\" gasped the dismayed Mrs. Truefitt.\n\n\"Don't you know me, mother?\"  inquired Mr. Richard Catesby, in grievous\nastonishment.\n\n\"He's mad,\" said her daughter.\n\n\"Am I so altered that you don't know me, Prudence?\"  inquired Mr.\nCatesby; with pathos.  \"Don't you know your Fred?\"\n\n\"Go out,\" said Mrs. Truefitt, recovering; \"go out at once.\"\n\nMr. Catesby looked from one to the other in consternation.\n\n\"I know I've altered,\" he said, at last, \"but I'd no idea--\"\n\n\"If you don't go out at once I'll send for the police,\" said the elder\nwoman, sharply.  \"Prudence, scream!\"\n\n\"I'm not going to scream,\" said Prudence, eyeing the intruder with great\ncomposure.  \"I'm not afraid of him.\"\n\nDespite her reluctance to have a scene--a thing which was strongly\nopposed to the traditions of Bashford's Lane--Mrs. Truefitt had got as\nfar as the doorstep in search of assistance, when a sudden terrible\nthought occurred to her: Fred was dead, and the visitor had hit upon this\nextraordinary fashion of breaking the news gently.\n\n\"Come into the parlour,\" she said, faintly.\n\nMr. Catesby, suppressing his surprise, followed her into the room.\nPrudence, her fine figure erect and her large eyes meeting his steadily,\ntook up a position by the side of her mother.\n\n\"You have brought bad news?\" inquired the latter.\n\n\"No, mother,\" said Mr. Catesby, simply, \"only myself, that's all.\"\n\nMrs. Truefitt made a gesture of impatience, and her daughter, watching\nhim closely, tried to remember something she had once read about\ndetecting insanity by the expression of the eyes.  Those of Mr. Catesby\nwere blue, and the only expression in them at the present moment was one\nof tender and respectful admiration.\n\n\"When did you see Fred last?\"  inquired Mrs. Truefitt, making another\neffort.\n\n\"Mother,\" said Mr. Catesby, with great pathos, \"don't you know me?\"\n\n\"He has brought bad news of Fred,\" said Mrs. Truefitt, turning to her\ndaughter; \"I am sure he has.\"\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" said Mr. Catesby, with a bewildered glance from\none to the other.  \"I am Fred.  Am I much changed?  You look the same as\nyou always did, and it seems only yesterday since I kissed Prudence\ngood-bye at the docks.  You were crying, Prudence.\"\n\nMiss Truefitt made no reply; she gazed at him unflinchingly and then bent\ntoward her mother.\n\n\"He is mad,\" she whispered; \"we must try and get him out quietly.  Don't\ncontradict him.\"\n\n\"Keep close to me,\" said Mrs. Truefitt, who had a great horror of the\ninsane.  \"If he turns violent open the window and scream.  I thought he\nhad brought bad news of Fred.  How did he know about him?\"\n\nHer daughter shook her head and gazed curiously at their afflicted\nvisitor.  She put his age down at twenty-five, and she could not help\nthinking it a pity that so good-looking a young man should have lost his\nwits.\n\n\"Bade Prudence good-bye at the docks,\" continued Mr. Catesby, dreamily.\n\"You drew me behind a pile of luggage, Prudence, and put your head on my\nshoulder.  I have thought of it ever since.\"\n\nMiss Truefitt did not deny it, but she bit her lips, and shot a sharp\nglance at him.  She began to think that her pity was uncalled-for.\n\n\"I'm just going as far as the corner.\"\n\n\"Tell me all that's happened since I've been away,\" said Mr. Catesby.\n\nMrs. Truefitt turned to her daughter and whispered.  It might have been\nmerely the effect of a guilty conscience, but the visitor thought that he\ncaught the word \"policeman.\"\n\n\"I'm just going as far as the corner,\" said Mrs. Truefitt, rising, and\ncrossing hastily to the door.\n\nThe young man nodded affectionately and sat in doubtful consideration as\nthe front door closed behind her.  \"Where is mother going?\"  he asked, in\na voice which betrayed a little pardonable anxiety.\n\n\"Not far, I hope,\" said Prudence.\n\n\"I really think,\" said Mr. Catesby, rising--\"I really think that I had\nbetter go after her.  At her age----\"\n\nHe walked into the small passage and put his hand on the latch.\nPrudence, now quite certain of his sanity, felt sorely reluctant to let\nsuch impudence go unpunished.\n\n\"Are you going?\" she inquired.\n\n\"I think I'd better,\" said Mr. Catesby, gravely.  \"Dear mother--\"\n\n\"You're afraid,\" said the girl, calmly.\n\nMr. Catesby coloured and his buoyancy failed him.  He felt a little bit\ncheap.\n\n\"You are brave enough with two women,\" continued the girl, disdainfully;\n\"but you had better go if you're afraid.\"\n\nMr. Catesby regarded the temptress uneasily.  \"Would you like me to\nstay?\" he asked.\n\n\"I?\" said Miss Truefitt, tossing her head.  \"No, I don't want you.\nBesides, you're frightened.\"\n\nMr. Catesby turned, and with a firm step made his way back to the room;\nPrudence, with a half-smile, took a chair near the door and regarded her\nprisoner with unholy triumph.\n\n\"I shouldn't like to be in your shoes,\" she said, agreeably; \"mother has\ngone for a policeman.\"\n\n\"Bless her,\" said Mr. Catesby, fervently.  \"What had we better say to him\nwhen he comes?\"\n\n\"You'll be locked up,\" said Prudence; \"and it will serve you right for\nyour bad behaviour.\"\n\nMr. Catesby sighed.  \"It's the heart,\" he said, gravely.  \"I'm not to\nblame, really.  I saw you standing in the window, and I could see at once\nthat you were beautiful, and good, and kind.\"\n\n\"I never heard of such impudence,\" continued Miss Truefitt.\n\n\"I surprised myself,\" admitted Mr. Catesby.  \"In the usual way I am very\nquiet and well-behaved, not to say shy.\"\n\nMiss Truefitt looked at him scornfully.  \"I think that you had better\nstop your nonsense and go,\" she remarked.\n\n\"Don't you want me to be punished?\" inquired the other, in a soft voice.\n\n\"I think that you had better go while you can,\" said the girl, and at\nthat moment there was a heavy knock at the front-door.  Mr. Catesby,\ndespite his assurance, changed colour; the girl eyed him in perplexity.\nThen she opened the small folding-doors at the back of the room.\n\n\"You're only--stupid,\" she whispered.  \"Quick!  Go in there.  I'll say\nyou've gone.  Keep quiet, and I'll let you out by-and-by.\"\n\nShe pushed him in and closed the doors.  From his hiding-place he heard\nan animated conversation at the street-door and minute particulars as to\nthe time which had elapsed since his departure and the direction he had\ntaken.\n\n\"I never heard such impudence,\" said Mrs. Truefitt, going into the\nfront-room and sinking into a chair after the constable had taken his\ndeparture.  \"I don't believe he was mad.\"\n\n\"Only a little weak in the head, I think,\" said Prudence, in a clear\nvoice.  \"He was very frightened after you had gone; I don't think he will\ntrouble us again.\"\n\n\"He'd better not,\" said Mrs. Truefitt, sharply.  \"I never heard of such a\nthing--never.\"\n\nShe continued to grumble, while Prudence, in a low voice, endeavoured to\nsoothe her.  Her efforts were evidently successful, as the prisoner was,\nafter a time, surprised to hear the older woman laugh--at first gently,\nand then with so much enjoyment that her daughter was at some pains to\nrestrain her.  He sat in patience until evening deepened into night, and\na line of light beneath the folding-doors announced the lighting of the\nlamp in the front-room.  By a pleasant clatter of crockery he became\naware that they were at supper, and he pricked up his ears as Prudence\nmade another reference to him.\n\n\"If he comes to-morrow night while you are out I sha'n't open the door,\"\nshe said.  \"You'll be back by nine, I suppose.\"\n\nMrs. Truefitt assented.\n\n\"And you won't be leaving before seven,\" continued Prudence.  \"I shall be\nall right.\"\n\nMr. Catesby's face glowed and his eyes grew tender; Prudence was as\nclever as she was beautiful.  The delicacy with which she had intimated\nthe fact of the unconscious Mrs. Truefitt's absence on the following\nevening was beyond all praise.  The only depressing thought was that such\nresourcefulness savoured of practice.\n\nHe sat in the darkness for so long that even the proximity of Prudence\nwas not sufficient amends for the monotony of it, and it was not until\npast ten o'clock that the folding-doors were opened and he stood blinking\nat the girl in the glare of the lamp.\n\n\"Quick!\"  she whispered.\n\nMr. Catesby stepped into the lighted room.\n\n\"The front-door is open,\" whispered Prudence.  \"Make haste.  I'll close\nit.\"\n\nShe followed him to the door; he made an ineffectual attempt to seize her\nhand, and the next moment was pushed gently outside and the door closed\nbehind him.  He stood a moment gazing at the house, and then hastened\nback to his ship.\n\n\"Seven to-morrow,\" he murmured; \"seven to-morrow.  After all, there's\nnothing pays in this world like cheek--nothing.\"\n\nHe slept soundly that night, though the things that the second-engineer\nsaid to him about wasting a hard-working man's evening would have lain\nheavy on the conscience of a more scrupulous man.  The only thing that\ntroubled him was the manifest intention of his friend not to let him slip\nthrough his fingers on the following evening.  At last, in sheer despair\nat his inability to shake him off, he had to tell him that he had an\nappointment with a lady.\n\n\"Well, I'll come, too,\" said the other, glowering at him.  \"It's very\nlike she'll have a friend with her; they generally do.\"\n\n\"I'll run round and tell her,\" said Catesby.  \"I'd have arranged it\nbefore, only I thought you didn't care about that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"Female society is softening,\" said the second-engineer.  \"I'll go and\nput on a clean collar.\"\n\nCatesby watched him into his cabin and then, though it still wanted an\nhour to seven, hastily quitted the ship and secreted himself in the\nprivate bar of the Beehive.\n\nHe waited there until a quarter past seven, and then, adjusting his tie\nfor about the tenth time that evening in the glass behind the bar,\nsallied out in the direction of No. 5.\n\nHe knocked lightly, and waited.  There was no response, and he knocked\nagain.  When the fourth knock brought no response, his heart sank within\nhim and he indulged in vain speculations as to the reasons for this\nunexpected hitch in the programme.  He knocked again, and then the door\nopened suddenly and Prudence, with a little cry of surprise and dismay,\nbacked into the passage.\n\n\"You!\"  she said, regarding him with large eyes.  Mr. Catesby bowed\ntenderly, and passing in closed the door behind him.\n\n\"I wanted to thank you for your kindness last night,\" he said, humbly.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Prudence; \"good-bye.\"\n\nMr. Catesby smiled.  \"It'll take me a long time to thank you as I ought\nto thank you,\" he murmured.  \"And then I want to apologise; that'll take\ntime, too.\"\n\n\"You had better go,\" said Prudence, severely; \"kindness is thrown away\nupon you.  I ought to have let you be punished.\"\n\n\"You are too good and kind,\" said the other, drifting by easy stages into\nthe parlour.\n\nMiss Truefitt made no reply, but following him into the room seated\nherself in an easy-chair and sat coldly watchful.\n\n\"How do you know what I am?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Your face tells me,\" said the infatuated Richard.  \"I hope you will\nforgive me for my rudeness last night.  It was all done on the spur of\nthe moment.\"\n\n\"I am glad you are sorry,\" said the girl, softening.\n\n\"All the same, if I hadn't done it,\" pursued Mr. Catesby, \"I shouldn't be\nsitting here talking to you now.\"\n\nMiss Truefitt raised her eyes to his, and then lowered them modestly to\nthe ground.  \"That is true,\" she said, quietly.\n\n\"And I would sooner be sitting here than any-where,\" pursued Catesby.\n\"That is,\" he added, rising, and taking a chair by her side, \"except\nhere.\"\n\nMiss Truefitt appeared to tremble, and made as though to rise.  Then she\nsat still and took a gentle peep at Mr. Catesby from the corner of her\neye.\n\n\"I hope that you are not sorry that I am here?\"  said that gentleman.\n\nMiss Truefitt hesitated.  \"No,\" she said, at last.\"\n\n\"Are you--are you glad?\" asked the modest Richard.\n\nMiss Truefitt averted her eyes altogether.  \"Yes,\" she said, faintly.\n\nA strange feeling of solemnity came over the triumphant Richard.  He took\nthe hand nearest to him and pressed it gently.\n\n\"I--I can hardly believe in my good luck,\" he murmured.\n\n\"Good luck?\" said Prudence, innocently.\n\n\"Isn't it good luck to hear you say that you are glad I'm here?\"  said\nCatesby.\n\n\"You're the best judge of that,\" said the girl, withdrawing her hand.\n\"It doesn't seem to me much to be pleased about.\"\n\nMr. Catesby eyed her in perplexity, and was about to address another\ntender remark to her when she was overcome by a slight fit of coughing.\nAt the same moment he started at the sound of a shuffling footstep in the\npassage.  Somebody tapped at the door.\n\n\"Yes?\" said Prudence.\n\n\"Can't find the knife-powder, miss,\" said a harsh voice.  The door was\npushed open and disclosed a tall, bony woman of about forty.  Her red\narms were bare to the elbow, and she betrayed several evidences of a long\nand arduous day's charing.\n\n\"It's in the cupboard,\" said Prudence.  \"Why, what's the matter, Mrs.\nPorter?\"\n\nMrs. Porter made no reply.  Her mouth was wide open and she was gazing\nwith starting eyeballs at Mr. Catesby.\n\n\"Joe!\" she said, in a hoarse whisper.  \"Joe!\"\n\nMr. Catesby gazed at her in chilling silence.  Miss Truefitt, with an air\nof great surprise, glanced from one to the other.\n\n\"Joe!\" said Mrs. Porter again.  \"Ain't you goin' to speak to me?\"\n\nMr. Catesby continued to gaze at her in speechless astonishment.  She\nskipped clumsily round the table and stood before him with her hands\nclasped.\n\n\"Where 'ave you been all this long time?\"  she demanded, in a higher key.\n\n\"You--you've made a mistake,\" said the bewildered Richard.\n\n\"Mistake?\"  wailed Mrs. Porter.  \"Mistake!  Oh, where's your 'art?\"\n\nBefore he could get out of her way she flung her arms round the horrified\nyoung man's neck and em-braced him copiously.  Over her bony left\nshoulder the frantic Richard met the ecstatic gaze of Miss Truefitt, and,\nin a flash, he realised the trap into which he had fallen.\n\n\"Mrs. Porter!\" said Prudence.\n\n\"It's my 'usband, miss,\" said the Amazon, reluctantly releasing the\nflushed and dishevelled Richard; \"'e left me and my five eighteen months\nago.  For eighteen months I 'aven't 'ad a sight of 'is blessed face.\"\n\nShe lifted the hem of her apron to her face and broke into discordant\nweeping.\n\n\"Don't cry,\" said Prudence, softly; \"I'm sure he isn't worth it.\"\n\nMr. Catesby looked at her wanly.  He was beyond further astonishment, and\nwhen Mrs. Truefitt entered the room with a laudable attempt to twist her\nfeatures into an expression of surprise, he scarcely noticed her.\n\n\"It's my Joe,\" said Mrs. Porter, simply.\n\n\"Good gracious!\" said Mrs. Truefitt.  \"Well, you've got him now; take\ncare he doesn't run away from you again.\"\n\n\"I'll look after that, ma'am,\" said Mrs. Porter, with a glare at the\nstartled Richard.\n\n\"She's very forgiving,\" said Prudence.  \"She kissed him just now.\"\n\n\"Did she, though,\" said the admiring Mrs. Truefitt.  \"I wish I'd been\nhere.\"\n\n\"I can do it agin, ma'am,\" said the obliging Mrs. Porter.\n\n\"If you come near me again--\" said the breathless Richard, stepping back\na pace.\n\n\"I shouldn't force his love,\" said Mrs. Truefitt; \"it'll come back in\ntime, I dare say.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he's affectionate,\" said Prudence.\n\nMr. Catesby eyed his tormentors in silence; the faces of Prudence and her\nmother betokened much innocent enjoyment, but the austerity of Mrs.\nPorter's visage was unrelaxed.\n\n\"Better let bygones be bygones,\" said Mrs. Truefitt; \"he'll be sorry\nby-and-by for all the trouble he has caused.\"\n\n\"He'll be ashamed of himself--if you give him time,\" added Prudence.\n\nMr. Catesby had heard enough; he took up his hat and crossed to the door.\n\n\"Take care he doesn't run away from you again,\" repeated Mrs. Truefitt.\n\n\"I'll see to that, ma'am,\" said Mrs. Porter, taking him by the arm.\n\"Come along, Joe.\"\n\nMr. Catesby attempted to shake her off, but in vain, and he ground his\nteeth as he realised the absurdity of his position.  A man he could have\ndealt with, but Mrs. Porter was invulnerable.  Sooner than walk down the\nroad with her he preferred the sallies of the parlour.  He walked back to\nhis old position by the fireplace, and stood gazing moodily at the floor.\n\nMrs. Truefitt tired of the sport at last.  She wanted her supper, and\nwith a significant glance at her daughter she beckoned the redoubtable\nand reluctant Mrs. Porter from the room.  Catesby heard the kitchen-door\nclose behind them, but he made no move.  Prudence stood gazing at him in\nsilence.\n\n\"If you want to go,\" she said, at last, \"now is your chance.\"\n\nCatesby followed her into the passage without a word, and waited quietly\nwhile she opened the door.  Still silent, he put on his hat and passed\nout into the darkening street.  He turned after a short distance for a\nlast look at the house and, with a sudden sense of elation, saw that she\nwas standing on the step.  He hesitated, and then walked slowly back.\n\n\"Yes?\"  said Prudence.\n\n\"I should like to tell your mother that I am sorry,\" he said, in a low\nvoice.\n\n\"It is getting late,\" said the girl, softly; \"but, if you really wish to\ntell her--Mrs. Porter will not be here to-morrow night.\"\n\nShe stepped back into the house and the door closed behind her.",
