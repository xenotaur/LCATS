Scene, scents and discerned details. Moments\nof climax. Instances at the apex of tension which left all ahanging on\nevery second of charged anticipation relieved by laughter when the\npunch line was delivered. Unexpected turns, surprise when it caught us\nat the tender flank, we were stupefied. Then senses roused us to cheer\nthe deftness of the deed.\n8>)",
