    "body": "A gray taxi was threading the traffic of Fifth Avenue. Up through the\nwealthiest street in the world the driver flashed with all the aplomb\nof a professional \u201cbucker\u201d who knew the elastic limits of the\nautomobile laws.\n\nChester Fay leaned forward now and then and studied the hands which\nshifted the lever at the street intersections like those of an American\nAce at the \u201cstick\u201d of a biplane.\n\n\u201cGood boy,\u201d he exclaimed when the taxi came to a grinding halt before\nthe doorman of the Hotel Rockingham. \u201cGood kid!\u201d he added when he\nextended the fare.\n\n\u201cI thank you,\u201d said the driver of the gray taxi.\n\nFay paused at the marble steps of the Hotel Rockingham. The taxi turned\nand darted southward.\n\nWheeling with a pucker of interest on his features, Fay strode through\nan alley of palms and bronze vases and leaned over an onyx-topped desk\nwhere stood a trim-looking clerk whose collar and tie indicated\nprosperity in subordinate positions.\n\n\u201cArthur Hilton?\u201d Fay questioned.\n\n\u201cBy appointment?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. He phoned me at--\u201d Fay glanced up to the gilt clock over the\nclerk\u2019s head. \u201cExactly twenty minutes ago!\u201d he declared.\n\nThe page who responded to the pressure of a button led the way to a\nprivate elevator, nodded to the pilot and closed the green-grilled door\nwhen Fay stepped briskly inside the cage.\n\nHe was whisked to a silent stop on an upper floor. He stepped out and\nfaced a gray-haired English detective of the superior type, who had\nbeen pacing an ornate hallway.\n\n\u201cArthur Hilton?\u201d said Fay.\n\n\u201cBy Sir Arthur\u2019s consent?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may follow me,\u201d drawled the Scotland Yard man.\n\nFay found himself in the foyer of a splendid suite. He waited, toying\nwith his cap, as the detective passed through a rift in the porti\u00e9res\nwhich led in the general direction of Fifth Avenue. He was on the point\nof coughing to attract attention when the curtains parted in\ninvitation.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nSir Arthur Hilton stood by a long window with the white light of a\nwestern sky reflected across his furrowed face like the reaching hand\nof a specter.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Fay?\u201d he said as the Scotland Yard man backed into the shadow\nof an inner room.\n\n\u201cYes. Chester Fay--Mr. George Mott, the reformer\u2019s friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood--good and bad! There\u2019s the old Nick to pay. Putney Stephney of\nDowning Street--a King\u2019s greyhound--with thirty thousand pounds in\nAmerican banknotes, was found dead on top of a goods-train at\nPoughkeepsie this morning.\u201d\n\nFay pulled out a cigarette.\n\n\u201cMurdered!\u201d declared Hilton with a rising voice. \u201cKilled in cold blood\nsomewhere between the steamer dock at West Street and--and\nPoughkeepsie.\u201d\n\nFay dragged on the cigarette, thrust his hands into his pockets and\nleaned forward. His eyes hardened slightly. They fastened within the\nsteady stare of Sir Arthur\u2019s own.\n\n\u201cFacts are these,\u201d resumed the British representative. \u201cStephney had\nlanded at the dock at ten-twenty last night. Was seen by two of the\nsteamship company\u2019s detectives who were watching all embarking\npassengers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas that the _Carpathia_?\u201d asked Fay.\n\n\u201cYes--the _Carpathia_! Stephney came down the gangplank, turned at the\ncustomroom, went inside a telephone booth, came out and was observed\ntaking a gray taxi at the foot of the dock. That was the last seen of\nhim until the chief of the railroad detectives at Poughkeepsie found\nhis body on top of a goods-train. Skull was slightly crushed. Pockets\nrifled. Portfolio, with banknotes and memoranda, missing.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuick work!\u201d\n\n\u201cBeastly quick!\u201d shot back Hilton through rigid lips. \u201cBeastly clever,\ntoo!\u201d\n\nThe British representative glanced toward the doorway before which the\nporti\u00e9res draped. He strode to Fay\u2019s side and leaned forward as his\nfingers clutched the investigator\u2019s left shoulder in the grip of a\nbulldog.\n\n\u201cStephney didn\u2019t die from the crushed skull,\u201d he said tersely. \u201cThat\naccident came afterward. He was killed by an unknown method. He was\nlured to death in the heart of civilization!\u201d\n\n\u201cAn unknown method?\u201d\n\n\u201cFact! Had the coroner of Poughkeepsie on the wire not an hour ago. A\nsurgeon from Plattsburg happened to assist at the autopsy. It was he\nwho detected the condition of the lungs. Also, Stephney\u2019s face was\ngreenish-black.\u201d\n\nFay backed away and allowed Sir Arthur\u2019s hand to drop. His eyes glazed\nwith speculation. They hardened.\n\n\u201cYou have other facts?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cLittle more! Stephney was last seen alive getting into a gray taxi\nwhich disappeared soon afterward. He was headed for this hotel. I sat\nup until three o\u2019clock waiting for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho else knew he was coming to New York?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Washington Embassy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho knew it in London?\u201d\n\n\u201cDowning Street.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhom do you suspect?\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican crooks.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody blames them--for everything.\u201d\n\nSir Arthur frowned. \u201cI\u2019ve given you the case--on account of Mr. Mott\u2019s\ninterest in ex-convicts and the Gray Brotherhood.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ll take it. I\u2019ll jump! I want all the facts you can allow me to\nhave.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve given you everything. The body found at Poughkeepsie on top of\nthe goods-train was Stephney\u2019s. There\u2019s no doubt of that. He was first\nidentified by the tailor\u2019s name in his pockets--Concre, of London, I\nthink. We\u2019ve a solicitor up there who made a complete identification.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid Stephney ever visit New York before?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce, two years ago--just after the end of the war.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould he know any women here?\u201d\n\n\u201cHardly! He was to come right to me!\u201d\n\nFay moved a chair and lifted his cap. He turned at the porti\u00e9res. His\nglance toward Arthur Hilton was one of understanding.\n\n\u201cYou and Mr. Mott alone know that I am on this case?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is locked with us!\u201d\n\n\u201cI have carte blanche?\u201d\n\n\u201cUp to ten thousand pounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood-by!\u201d said Fay, creasing his checked cap as he parted the curtains\nand strode through the suite to the hallway of the hotel.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe jabbed at a pearl button until the private elevator floated up to\nhim. He reached the street and turned toward the Avenue. He saw there a\ngray taxi. A young man sat on the driver\u2019s seat. He was moving\nsouthward close by the right curb.\n\nA swift sprint, a ducking lunge before the silver radiator of a\npolished limousine, a hasty reach for the wind-shield of the taxi, and\na startled exclamation from the driver--these occurred within seven\nseconds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going downtown,\u201d said Fay, settling back in the front seat and\nstaring boldly at the driver. \u201cDon\u2019t mind if I ride out here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI certainly do! It\u2019s against the company\u2019s regulations.\u201d\n\n\u201cSet the meter and drive on. I\u2019ve really got something I want to say to\nyou.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, of all the nerve!\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly--certainly! I\u2019ve always been interested in this new company\nwith the gray taxies and the paroled men who drive them. I\u2019m a Western\nnewspaper man--come from Chicago. Suppose you tell me all about the\nGray Taxi Company. How many taxies are there? Who\u2019s the originator?\nHow\u2019s business? Do you cover the steamship docks?\u201d\n\n\u201cSay! On the dead, you\u2019ve got nerve. I\u2019m going to call the first\ntraffic cop I meet. There\u2019s one!\u201d\n\nFay reached into his right-hand trouser pocket. His hand appeared with\na five-dollar bill between his fingers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet you this you don\u2019t,\u201d he said, pressing the bill into the\ndriver\u2019s lap. \u201cTake it and buy a good dinner. There\u2019s another coming to\nyou if you answer my questions.\u201d\n\nThe driver clutched the steering-wheel with both hands as he brought\nhis knees together and pressed a leather toe upon the throttle. The\ntaxi leaped by the traffic cop, dodged a bus and roared on down the\nAvenue until an open place was gained.\n\n\u201cGo slow,\u201d said Fay. \u201cLoaf along and let me get some dope for my\narticle. Who owns the Gray Taxi Company?\u201d\n\n\u201cJames Ponsardin.\u201d\n\n\u201cProprietor of the morning _Messenger_?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure! He owns the company.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many taxies?\u201d\n\n\u201cFifty running now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho manages it?\u201d\n\n\u201cA girl!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure! Her name is Elsie De Groot. She\u2019s making it pay, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d Fay stared into the alert face of the driver at\nthe wheel. \u201cIs she an ex-convict?\u201d\n\n\u201cI never heard that said about her!\u201d\n\n\u201cLoyal!\u201d thought Chester Fay, shifting in his position. \u201cYou never\nheard,\u201d he repeated aloud. \u201cThat\u2019s definite. Do you keep records of\npassengers carried?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe make a report out at night. Miss Elsie gets them.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo your taxies cover the steamship docks?\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes--if there\u2019s a call.\u201d\n\nFay saw that he was in the presence of a very matter-of-fact young man\nwho was making his own way in the world.\n\n\u201cMind taking me to the Southampton Line?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe driver\u2019s answer was to glance around the right-hand side of the\ntaxi, slow to a crawl, then swing the corner with both arms over the\nwheel.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nFay braced himself for five blocks of cobbled streets upon the surface\nof which ragged children played ball and dodged death. He stepped down\nfrom the taxi as it came to a gliding stop before the ornate entrance\nto the great dock.\n\n\u201cMind waiting?\u201d\n\nThe driver glanced at the taxi-meter.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve paid me for a couple of hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cStay right here. Ill be back in ten minutes.\u201d\n\nChester Fay found two English detectives covering the dock. With them\nwas a Secret Service operative of slight acquaintance.\n\n\u201cHello!\u201d he said, drawing this man to one side. \u201cSay, Gardner,\u201d he\nwhispered, \u201cwho would know down here what happened last night when the\n_Carpathia\u2019s_ passengers came down the planks? I want to trace a man\nwho took a Gray taxi. The man is--\u201d\n\n\u201cPutney Steph--Stephney.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Fay raised his brows. The matter was evidently out.\n\n\u201cHas he been found?\u201d\n\nFay shook his head. He recalled that Sir Arthur Hilton had not given\ninstructions to make public the matter of the finding of the body on\nthe railroad train at Poughkeepsie.\n\n\u201cNot found yet, eh?\u201d Gardner said. \u201cWell, I did all I could. Come over\nhere. That\u2019s right. Now we can talk. That British team are\nlistening-in.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you find?\u201d\n\n\u201cStephney came down the plank, showed his passports, went into a\nslot-booth, lugged his bag and a leather case out toward the street and\nthere hailed a Gray taxi. That much is settled. The taxi was driven by\na chauffeur with reddish-brown hair. His nose was slightly turned up.\nHe had on a yellow coat and leather leggins. He\u2019d been waiting around\nthe dock for over three hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cMust have expected him!\u201d\n\n\u201cLooks that way, Chester. He had plenty of fares offered him. You see,\nthem Gray taxies are all the fashion now. They\u2019re gettin\u2019 the\nbusiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were here at the time the passenger arrived?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I got my information from old Harry, who watched the express\nwagons and taxies. He\u2019s positive about the red-haired chauffeur. Said\nhe was a bold trick!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s right. Good-by!\u201d\n\nFay left the Government operative and darted for a telephone booth.\nInto the slot of this he dropped a nickel and obtained, after a brief\nwait, Mr. George Mott\u2019s secretary.\n\n\u201cThis is Chester Fay!\u201d he said briskly. \u201cSay, get about ten of the Gray\nBrotherhood rounded up right away and cover these assignments. Got it?\u201d\nhe added, drawing the door shut with caution. \u201cYes--yes! They\u2019ll do.\nCover Poughkeepsie and a corpse found there this morning on top of a\nNew York Central freight-car. Cover the morgue. Have them see the Army\nsurgeon who made the autopsy on the lungs. Have them connect with the\ncoroner and the railroad detectives who found the body.\u201d\n\nFay paused and mopped his brow with his sleeve. It was hot in the\nbooth.\n\n\u201cYes, there\u2019s more!\u201d he snapped. \u201cCover James Ponsardin of the\n_Messenger_. Put him to bed and get him up in the morning. Find him and\nkeep the boys tailing him till I call them off. That\u2019s all ... no, send\nRake to the corner of the block where the Gray Taxi Company has its\ngarage. Tell him I\u2019ll meet him there in fifteen minutes!\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was eleven minutes later when Fay requested the driver of the taxi\nto deposit him on the northeastern corner of the block around which\nGray taxies to the number of a score or more were scattered. Fay handed\nover a second bill with a polite bow.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to visit your boss,\u201d he said with a quick smile. \u201cI\u2019ll pump\nher in private for that write-up of mine. It ought to go big in our\nWestern syndicate.\u201d\n\nThe driver twisted his wrist and studied the time. He set the meter to\nthe off position. \u201cGood-by!\u201d he said, leaning over and releasing the\nemergency brake. \u201cI\u2019m much obliged!\u201d\n\nFay turned and stared into the broad Irish face of the ex-convict he\nhad expected to meet.\n\n\u201cAh, Rake--on time!\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, Chester! I was just watchin\u2019 you and that wild-looking driver.\nThey\u2019re gettin\u2019 all the high-class business.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on! Follow me and keep your eyes open. We\u2019re going to look a\nlittle lady over. Miss Elsie, the manager, is under suspicion.\u201d\n\nFay led the way along the sidewalk and threaded his steps through a\ngroup of young men outside the Gray Taxi Garage. He eyed each one for\npossible red hair and turned-up nose. He entered the doorway, dodged a\nfast-flying taxi which was coming out on second speed, then knocked\nupon the ground glass of a door marked _Private--Keep Out--This Means\nYou!_\n\nA slip of a girl answered the knock. She glanced from Fay\u2019s face to the\npeering countenance of Rake.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for a Miss Elsie De Groot,\u201d said Fay, thrusting his foot\nforward. \u201cI\u2019m a newspaper man. I--want to write her up for a Western\nsyndicate. It ought to bring some business.\u201d\n\nThe girl toyed with a pencil which she jabbed like a bayonet into a\nraven-hued turban. \u201cI\u2019ll see,\u201d she said, turning and gliding through an\ninner door.\n\nPresently her elfin face gladdened the opening as Fay half advanced\ninto the outer office.\n\n\u201cCome in, please. Miss De Groot will see you.\u201d\n\nChester Fay removed his cap, crushed it between his fingers and stepped\nbriskly forward. He paused before the edge of a rug. Across this rug\nsat a girl. She swiveled in a businesslike chair and threw one neat\nankle over the other. She glanced impatiently upward.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to see you alone,\u201d Fay said as he noted a mop of reddish\nhair and a freckled nose which seemed to be pressed up by an unseen\nfinger. \u201cAlone,\u201d he added, swinging upon the stenographer and jerking\nhis chin toward the door.\n\n\u201cWhy, certainly!\u201d\n\nThe girl slipped out and closed the door. Fay left Rake\u2019s side and\nmoved up close to a littered desk which bore some resemblance to order.\n\n\u201cTo be brief as time!\u201d he said, drawing a card from his pocket. \u201cTo be\nbrief,\u201d he whispered, replacing the card, \u201cI want to know just why you\ntook a taxi at or about six o\u2019clock last night, went down to the\nSouthampton Dock and waited for a passenger who wore a Silver\nGreyhound--indicating that he was on British Government business,\nurgent and pressing.\u201d\n\nThe girl\u2019s broad forehead whitened slightly. She recrossed her trim\nankles. She tapped the desk before her with polished nails. She reached\nand adjusted a hairpin in her reddish knot, which added beauty to a\nresolute, somewhat bold face.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what business that is of yours!\u201d she said.\n\nFay frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s the people\u2019s business! It\u2019s Charles Mott\u2019s business.\nAre you going to help me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI never talk to strangers. You may be Mr. Mott\u2019s representative. You\nmay be connected with the Gray Brotherhood. How do I know?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what happened to your fare last night?\u201d\n\nThe girl swung in the chair and glanced at Rake. Her eyes opened to\nbrown pools of protest. She brought both feet down on the rug and rose\nwith her hand on the back of the chair.\n\n\u201cYou both better go.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust a minute. You know Putney Stephney?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what happened to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want to know?\u201d\n\n\u201cSee here!\u201d The girl\u2019s voice indicated reserve strength. \u201cSee here!\nThis is my office. We--I, am obeying the law. Our business is of such a\nnature that we do not talk to strangers. To tell you frankly, I detest\npeople who ask too many questions.\u201d\n\nFay took the thrust with good humor. \u201cThey\u2019re not all the same,\u201d he\nsaid, moving closer to the girl and regarding her with admiration. \u201cNow\nyou, for instance, know full well that I didn\u2019t come here without being\npretty sure of my ground. You\u2019ll have to answer my questions, or you\nwill be called to account for a number of nasty accusations. Mr. Mott\nis your friend--he also is my friend!\u201d\n\nThe girl turned helplessly toward the closed door. She tapped her foot\non the rug. She bent her head.\n\n\u201cHow came you to know Putney Stephney?\u201d Fay asked, feeling his way for\na surprise.\n\n\u201cI met him two years ago. He was just a good friend of mine. I can\u2019t\nsee your purpose in questioning me concerning him.\u201d\n\nFay watched her lips tremble. He had conceived a liking for Elsie De\nGroot over the period of minutes. He said through his white teeth:\n\n\u201cPutney Stephney was murdered last night!\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl swayed. She reached blindly for the arms of the chair.\n\n\u201cMurdered by an unknown method!\u201d\n\nA gasping sob racked the air. The beat of a powerful engine throbbed\nthe garage. It was like the roll of a muffled drum.\n\n\u201cFoully murdered! Done to death between the steamship dock and\nPoughkeepsie, where he was found with skull crushed and his lungs empty\nof air. He was last seen getting into your taxicab!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t! It isn\u2019t true!\u201d\n\nFay leaned until his eyes compelled hers to waver. \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d he\nwhispered. \u201cNow, tell me what happened to Putney Stephney? The matter\nis going to do the Gray Brotherhood and the Gray Taxi Company\nconsiderable harm.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo with him?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly! What did you do with him? The truth, and nothing but the\ntruth. It\u2019s bound to come out!\u201d\n\n\u201cSee here!\u201d The girl braced her shoulders and stared back defiantly.\n\u201cSee here!\u201d she flashed with sudden anger. \u201cI can give you no\ninformation except--\u201d\n\n\u201cExcept what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe record of the call. That is all that I will ever give you or\nanybody else. My personal affairs are not to be dragged about by an\namateur investigator.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I want.\u201d Fay turned and motioned for Rake to leave the\noffice. He waited until the door closed with a click.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be frank,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m here to help you out. You met\nStephney at the dock, after waiting around for hours. I\u2019d judge by this\naction that you knew him. He perhaps wirelessed or telegraphed you from\nQuarantine.\u201d\n\nThe girl brushed her hair from her eyes with the back of her right\nhand. She stared at the rug, then into Fay\u2019s keen face.\n\n\u201cI met him by his own appointment.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh! Now we\u2019re getting on, Miss Elsie. You met him--after waiting a\nlong time. He had an enormous sum of money. You alone knew that he was\ncoming. He trusted in you so as to be safe in a city comparatively\nstrange--to him. He--\u201d\n\n\u201cTrusted me--yes! We stopped at Figaro\u2019s on Forty-second Street. We had\na club sandwich served to us. I sat outside with him because I--I had\nthese clothes on.\u201d\n\nThe girl swept her hands over her leggins and short skirt.\n\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, I took him on uptown within six or seven blocks of the\nRockingham. He said he would walk the rest of the way. I left him on\nthe curb. He started north.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s clear,\u201d said Fay. \u201cHe started north. Did you see him any more?\u201d\n\nThe girl dropped her eyes and studied the design of the office rug. \u201cI\ndid and I didn\u2019t. He got in another cab--I think!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. There was no reason for him to do that. He had only a few blocks\nto go in order to reach the hotel.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a cab?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of ours--a Gray taxi.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t you know who was driving it? Was it following you?\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nA puzzled pucker gathered in a little square upon the girl\u2019s white\nforehead. She reached to the littered desk and lifted a call-sheet. She\nheld this out with shaking fingers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve questioned every one of my drivers. No one of them admits taking\nMr. Stephney or anyone else to the Rockingham. I didn\u2019t understand it\nlast night; I don\u2019t now. It was certainly a taxi painted like ours that\nhe got in. I thought it so strange.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid this other driver call him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I was turning when I looked up the Avenue. Putney was\nrunning from the curb with one hand raised. He jumped on the\nrunning-board of the taxi, which disappeared from under an arclight. I\ndidn\u2019t see anything more.\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t that strike you as a strange proceeding?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it did! I thought a lot about it. I went over the call-sheet and\nasked all of the drivers. Two are out yet, but I know where they were\nat the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you often take representatives of the British Government around?\nHave they a charge-account?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t answer those questions. You must ask Mr. Hilton.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want to tell me anything about James Ponsardin?\u201d\n\nThe girl started. She folded the call-sheet by running it through her\nfingers.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t! You\u2019ll have to see him.\u201d\n\nFay fished in his pocket and brought forth the same card he had before\nshown to the girl.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find me at Mr. George Mott\u2019s office. Please call me up if you\ndiscover anything. Ask those two drivers whom you didn\u2019t question. Help\nus in every way. This murder is an international matter. Keep thinking\nabout what happened last night. We must find the murderer!\u201d\n\nFay laid the card on the desk, bowed slightly toward the silent girl,\nnodded to the stenographer, and joined Rake in the run-way of the\ngarage.\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe big ex-convict was staring at the group of drivers who were\nawaiting assignments. He smiled broadly as he felt Fay\u2019s hand on his\nshoulder.\n\n\u201cSome bunch, Chester!\u201d\n\n\u201cAny of your old pals here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only one I remember is that snob-nosed mechanic over there--the\nfellow under that car.\u201d\n\nFay wheeled. A pair of bright eyes, grease-rimmed and shadowed with\nblond lashes, was peering out at him. A tapping sounded upon the rear\naxle of the taxi as Fay stooped a trifle. The mechanic extended one\nhand and coiled his fingers about a spanner.\n\n\u201cThe only one in the place,\u201d said Rake. \u201cI served time with him\nsomewhere--maybe in Sing Sing, maybe Joliet.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, Rake!\u201d\n\nFay led the way to the sidewalk, nodded pleasantly to the staring\ndrivers, then turned toward the west. It was at the corner of the block\nwhere he paused and glanced in the direction of the garage.\n\n\u201cThe entire case rests there,\u201d he declared without pointing. \u201cStephney\nwas murdered in a Gray taxi. He was suffocated in some way to render\nhim unconscious. He was tossed on top of a freight-train after being\nwell plucked. This much we know. Now, how was it done?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a woman was mixed up in it. That girl looked like a\nperfect lady. An old night-hawk, who is as crooked as his whip, might\ndo it. He could get a cab an\u2019 turn the trick.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the mysterious way of suffocating a man?\u201d\n\nThe ex-convict scratched his head.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d he admitted. \u201cO\u2019Toole, Flynn, Fogarty, Harris an\u2019\nJohnson--they ought to discover something, Chester. Harrigan, Mr.\nMott\u2019s man, sent them running after you telephoned. He\u2019s called on the\nHarlem Branch for three more of the Brotherhood to cover the case.\nYou\u2019ve got nine or ten boys out now.\u201d\n\n\u201cHardly enough. We\u2019ll get more! Suppose we walk west for a block or\ntwo. I want to think this puzzle over.\u201d\n\nRake fell in behind Fay. They crossed the street and took a shady side.\nThe last rays of the western sun struck slanting through the ca\u00f1on of\ntenements. The street resounded with the shouts of urchins playing\nball. A truck went by as Fay paused and clicked keys in his pocket.\n\nHe glanced up at Rake.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to cover the Hudson River homes,\u201d he said. \u201cLooks to me as\nif the body was being taken over the railroad track when it was thrown\non top of a freight-car. Who is investigating Poughkeepsie and the\nrouting of the train?\u201d\n\n\u201cO\u2019Toole an\u2019 Flynn went north, Chester.\u201d\n\nFay dragged out his watch and studied the dial. \u201cIt\u2019s too early yet for\nthem to report. It\u2019s too--\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stared open-mouthed toward the Avenue ahead of him. He reached and\nclutched Rake\u2019s arm. He gripped this with fingers of steel.\n\n\u201cDid you see that?\u201d\n\n\u201cSee wot, Chester?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Gray taxi that went by?\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw one. I didn\u2019t notice it particularly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was being driven thirty miles an hour by Elsie De Groot! I\u2019m\npositive it was her. Reddish hair and turned-up nose!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the colleen who runs the garage?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes--the girl of the garage! The same little lady who met Putney\nStephney at the steamship dock last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gettin\u2019 on, Chester. It looks bad for the Brotherhood.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd for the Sisterhood! We just finished talking to her not a\nhalf--not twenty minutes ago; and there she goes uptown--full speed and\nmore.\u201d\n\nFay eyed his watch and ran a polished finger-nail over the crystal.\n\n\u201cTwenty-two minutes!\u201d he declared, replacing the timepiece in his vest\npocket.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back, Chester.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! We\u2019ll go on to the office of the morning _Messenger_. Foley is\ntheir sporting editor. Perhaps he can tell us something about Ponsardin\nand the taxi-company.\u201d\n\n\u201cNice name!\u201d blurted the ex-inmate. \u201cSounds like a doped wine an\u2019\ndeep-dyed villainy.\u201d\n\nFay grasped Rake by the elbow and hurried him in the direction of the\navenue up which the taxi had flashed. There was no trace of it. Fay\nhesitated a moment, like a keen hound on a scent, then fell into a\nbrisk walk northward, which took him to the somewhat unostentatious\nbuilding that housed the uptown offices of the _Messenger_.\n\nFoley, the sporting editor, was in. He greeted Fay with a hand thrust\nover a battered typewriter propped upon a broken desk. He thrust aside\na bundle of press clippings and cleared off two chairs.\n\n\u201cSit down!\u201d he welcomed. \u201cGot some dope on the crook game for me?\u201d\n\nFay leaned back and glanced about the office with slow caution, then\nshot a question at Foley through rigid lips.\n\n\u201cWhat do you know about Ponsardin--your proprietor?\u201d\n\nFoley tried to wink with lashless eyelids. He upended a huge can of\ncold tea, drank deeply, glanced at the keyboard of his typewriter\nbefore he set the can down on the corner of a box which had once\ncontained ink rolls.\n\n\u201cWhat do I know? Nothing! He\u2019s a queer stick. Bought the paper about\nthree years ago. Hardly ever see him. Goes to Washington quite often.\nThe police are investigating the sheet, I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Fay.\n\n\u201cYep! There\u2019s been talk of the actual ownership being in the hands of a\nlot of sure-thing grafters and gamblers. I\u2019m looking for a knockout and\nan upper-cut from the postal authorities any time. You can\u2019t pinch me!\nI don\u2019t write the editorials.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey advocate horse-racing and open gambling?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey certainly did--a year or two ago. Now we\u2019ve been instructed to\nhit a bunch of contractors and reformers. Take it from me, Fay, I don\u2019t\nthink the _Messenger_ is making any money.\u201d\n\n\u201cBills paid and all that?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, sure! James Ponsardin is rated three A\u2019s and a One.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he French or Swiss?\u201d\n\n\u201cCame from Switzerland, I think. Bright fellow, but--\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere does he live? Directory gives an apartment on Riverside Drive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI went up there once with some tickets to a bout. He wasn\u2019t there.\nButler said he was up-State. I guess he\u2019s dug in, covered up and pulled\nthe hole in after him. No one around here or downtown knows where to\nfind him.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know anything about the Gray Taxi Company?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one with the ex-convict drivers?\u201d\n\nChester Fay nodded.\n\n\u201cNo. I heard the bunch talking about it. Why did you ask?\u201d\n\nFay rose from his chair and threw back his shoulders. \u201cYour boss is\nsupposed to own it,\u201d he said. \u201cPonsardin _is_ the owner! I\u2019ve got a\ncase that\u2019s far from being clear, Foley. I\u2019ll give you first chance\nwhen I\u2019ve worked it out for Mr. Mott. Good-by!\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nRake led the way out and down the steps to the street.\n\n\u201cWhere to, Chester?\u201d he asked as they stood on the sidewalk.\n\n\u201cNearest telephone!\u201d said Fay, thrusting his hands in his pockets in\nsearch for some change.\n\nRake waited outside of the cigar-store while Fay entered a booth. Night\nwas dropping on the city. The sun had set over the blue barriers of the\nPalisades. The lights of Broadway slashed the purple heavens from south\nto north. Forty-second Street with its sign-clusters marked the center\nof the illumination.\n\nIt was a long ten minutes before Fay emerged with his teeth clamping a\nslender Perfecto. He passed one to Rake.\n\n\u201cSmoke up!\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s on the British representatives. I\u2019ve got a\ngood lead from Arthur Hilton. It\u2019s one I overlooked in my haste this\nmorning. I think we get our people tonight!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat people, Chester?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe crooks who killed Stephney. They were after bigger game. The\nothers of Stephney\u2019s suite are due on the _Imparada_. Hilton tells me\nprivately that she has been sighted from Sandy Hook.\u201d\n\nRake examined the cigar, then lighted it and started puffing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get you! What\u2019s due on the ship? What\u2019s it got to do with--\u201d\n\nFay started toward Broadway. Rake followed with the question still upon\nhis mind.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re closing in,\u201d said Fay as he brought a sheet of paper from his\nside pocket and spread it out on the palm of his right hand. \u201cI did a\nlot of phoning. There\u2019s nothing new at Poughkeepsie--except that the\ntrain upon which Stephney\u2019s body was found was made up on Tenth Avenue,\nNew York.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Death Avenue!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s well named. It left at seven o\u2019clock. It passed the Harlem River\nat eight-sixteen. It reached Harmon at nine-three. It rolled into\nPoughkeepsie early in the morning and was shunted on a sidetrack. The\nrailroad detectives searched it carefully while looking for tramps. It\nwas then they found the body.\u201d\n\nRake eyed the sheet of paper.\n\n\u201cDid O\u2019Toole get all that?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cYes. He saw the coroner and the Army surgeon. Stephney was suffocated\nand completely out of this life when his body was dropped on top of the\ntrain. That must have been from some small bridge leading over the\ntracks to the Hudson River. It was either to a boathouse or a private\nestate.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo on,\u201d said Rake.\n\n\u201cHilton--Sir Arthur--tells me that two members of the same banking\nfirm, coming over on the _Imparada_, have considerable money with them.\nThis Commission, of which Stephney was a member, came on different\nsteamers on account of a secret matter pertaining to pending treaties.\nThese two members will dock sometime tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the same pier, Chester?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the Southampton Pier.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat looks like business. We\u2019ll be there, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight there! We\u2019ll meet the bankers at Quarantine, substitute\nourselves for them, and land, all regular and proper, at the\nSouthampton dock. I notified Harrigan, at Mr. Mott\u2019s office, to get our\noutfits. They\u2019ll be waiting for us with a valet at the Battery. We will\nhave a valet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, Chester?\u201d\n\n\u201cJoe Yeader will play that part to perfection. Remember his accent? He\ndid time in Brixton Jail.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it all,\u201d blurted Rake. \u201cWhat is coming off?\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nFay furrowed his brow and stared seriously toward the paper in his\nhand. He thrust it into his pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll explain later,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going right into the lion\u2019s den. We\u2019ll bait the trap with more\nbanknotes. We\u2019ve got to clear the name of the Gray Brotherhood and the\nex-inmates working for the Gray Taxi Company.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you suspect that girl?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have every reason to believe she is guilty.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe don\u2019t look the part.\u201d\n\n\u201cLooks and beauty are skin deep!\u201d\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t talk like a gun moll or a fallen sister.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s employed by a man who is suspected by the police and Mr. Mott.\nShe has sole charge of Ponsardin\u2019s taxicab interests. She was the first\nto meet Stephney on this side of the Atlantic. She was the last to see\nhim alive, according to her own admission. What would you think from\nall that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think a lot, Chester. But appearances are deceiving. She\u2019d never\nadmitted takin\u2019 that Stephney from the dock if she was guilty. She\u2019d of\ndenied it. The only time my Mary, at home, is lyin\u2019 to me is when she\nsays nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIllogical logic!\u201d\n\n\u201cSure--an\u2019 it\u2019s the truth, nine times out of ten, Chester.\u201d\n\nFay glanced at his watch and quickened his steps. \u201cWe\u2019ll take the\nSubway to the Customhouse. From there we go over the Bay.\u201d\n\nRake scratched his head and followed Fay down the steps, past the\nticket-chopper, and lunged with him into the warm interior of a subway\ncar. They were hurtled southward. Fay said nothing during the quick\ntrip. His mind wove the details of the plan which he had to save the\nname of the Gray Brotherhood.\n\nHe mounted to the surface of the street, closely followed by Rake. He\nsought a phone-booth before crossing to the Customhouse. Rake heard him\ngiving a series of rapid-fire directions to Harrigan, the manager at\nGeorge Mott\u2019s headquarters.\n\nFay emerged, tossed a dollar across to the cigar-clerk and jerked his\nthumb toward a box of Perfectos. \u201cEight of those!\u201d he said. \u201cEight!\u201d\n\nOutside, in the cool evening, the two men drew a long breath of smoke\nfor the final plunge. They dodged a flashing taxi, climbed the\nCustomhouse steps, and found, after consulting an alert doorman, that\nthe harbor master\u2019s assistant was in.\n\nTo him Fay showed his card, his authority from George Mott, and other\nidentifications. He sealed the matter with a cigar. The assistant to\nthe harbor master made out passes in duplicate. He found the sealing\nwax and a well-chewed pen. He passed the finished documents over, after\na scrawled signature in each corner.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll take you aboard anything from here to the Hook,\u201d he said,\nleaning and watching Fay.\n\n\u201cThanks!\u201d said Fay. \u201cI\u2019ll see if they will!\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ferry-house was thronged with passengers as the two ex-inmates\nsearched about for Joe Yeader. These passengers thinned. A man stepped\nforward and clucked from the corner of his mouth.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Fay swiftly. \u201cHop aboard, and we\u2019ll follow.\u201d\n\nRake trailed Yeader and Fay. The three men secured seats in the\nsmoking-cabin. Yeader, crossing his legs over a yellow kit-bag, took\nFay\u2019s proffered Perfecto, and drawled:\n\n\u201cAt your service, sirs. Beastly sultry night.\u201d\n\nThe ferry-boat reached St. George. The three rushed for a train which\nwould pass Quarantine Station on an inland route. They descended at a\ndark station, walked rapidly through silent streets till they came to\nthe gleaming waters of the Narrows.\n\nFay saluted a man on guard, showed his authority from the Customhouse,\nand received permission to enter the telegraph station.\n\nHe turned on the steps and glanced down at Yeader and Rake.\n\n\u201cStay here!\u201d he said. \u201cHold the bag. I\u2019m going up and find out when the\n_Imparada_ comes in. Also, I shall send a wireless message to the\nmanager of the Gray Taxi Company.\u201d\n\nRake started. He frowned in perplexity. \u201cHow can you do that, Chester?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got authority to do most anything. I want a Gray taxi to meet us\nwhen we dock with the _Imparada_. Perhaps your nice little blonde with\nthe turned-up nose will be driving.\u201d\n\nRake shook his head when Fay disappeared. He clenched his fists and\nglanced upward at the topmost light in the dark tower. He swung on one\nheel as Yeader touched his shoulder.\n\n\u201cBig ship coming in!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe _Imparada_?\u201d\n\n\u201cLooks like it. We\u2019ll have to hurry. Call Chester!\u201d\n\nFay appeared at Rake\u2019s third shrilling whistle.\n\n\u201cAll set,\u201d he said, waving his arm toward the Government dock. \u201cLet\u2019s\nget down to the quarantine boat.\u201d\n\nA dark wharf jutted like a pointing finger from a green, sloping shore.\nUpon this wharf great, rusty cables and buoys were scattered.\n\nFay led the way through the buoys and presented his passes to a sailor\non guard before a wire gate.\n\n\u201cGoing out to the _Imparada_!\u201d he said authoritatively.\n\nThe sailor hitched his trousers, turned, squinted through the sea\nmists, then swung the gate.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to hurry,\u201d he said. \u201cThe quarantine boat is casting off\nher shore lines.\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nWrapped in the cloak of gray vapor, the three men crouched forward of\nthe wheelhouse and stared out across the Narrows to where a great ship\nglided like a glow-worm in a garden.\n\nThey heard the quarantine boat\u2019s bells as it maneuvered beneath the\ntowering overhang of the giant passenger ship. They mounted a pilot\u2019s\nladder which had been lowered for the quarantine officers.\n\nFay whispered into an officer\u2019s ear after he sprang over the rail. He\nmotioned aft. Rake and Yeader, with the kit-bag, followed closely.\n\nThe two British bankers were seated at the taffrail. To them Fay told\nhis mission, and his object of substituting himself and party, in order\nto discover who had slain Stephney. The bankers had already been\ninformed of the murder. They were noncommittal. They rose from steamer\nchairs, studied Fay\u2019s credentials, stared keenly at Yeader and Rake,\nthen consulted in whispers.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d they said finally. \u201cCome to our staterooms.\u201d\n\nThe transformation which was made while the ship glided to her dock was\nthorough and startling. Fay upended Yeader\u2019s kit-bag and sorted out its\ncontents. He changed his appearance before the eyes of the silent\nBritishers. He put on goggles and borrowed a more pronounced checked\ncap than the one he had worn to the ship.\n\nHe ran a hand across his face, then tapped a well-bound packet\nsuggestively.\n\n\u201cAll set,\u201d he said, looking at himself in a glass. \u201cBy Jove! George\nMott or Arthur Hilton wouldn\u2019t know me!\u201d\n\nWrapping a long mackintosh about his slender form, Fay threw open the\ndoor and led the way to the boat-deck.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll stand here,\u201d he said to Rake and Yeader. \u201cThe ship is almost in.\nNow play your parts. Look out for a Gray taxi.\u201d\n\nThe ship snugged against the dock, under pressure from two snorting\ntugs. Steam plumed aft the giant funnels. A bell clanged its final\nmessage to the engine-room. A gangplank was raised in the gloom. It\nsteadied and swung inboard.\n\n\u201cCome!\u201d cried Fay; \u201cFollow me!\u201d\n\nThe way led down through a companion, along a luggage-littered deck and\npast the second officer, who gave the signal that they could descend\nthe gangplank.\n\nFay shaded his face from the Central Office men at the foot of the\nplank. He turned and motioned for Rake and Yeader. They hurried over\nthe splintered dock and reached the first of the shore throng to meet\nthe incoming passengers.\n\n\u201cGo ahead!\u201d said Fay to Yeader. \u201cLug the bag and find the taxi. Tell\nthe driver you\u2019re from the British Banking Commission. Pile on all the\nCockney you know.\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe throng parted. Fay saw, to one side of the dock entrance, a waiting\ntaxi. Upon its seat a form crouched. Yeader waved his hand, opened the\ntaxi door, tossed in the bag and assisted Fay and Rake to mount the\nrunning-board and step inside.\n\n\u201c\u2019Otel Rockingham!\u201d exclaimed Yeader. \u201cGo a\u2019ead!\u201d\n\nThe door clicked shut with a strong pressure. The driver lowered the\ntaxi-meter flag, released the brake and moved through first, second,\nand into third speed with the cunning manipulation of a professional.\n\nFay rubbed the thick plate glass at his side, glanced out at the\nflashing lights and street intersections, before he leaned down and\nopened the bag.\n\n\u201cTake these,\u201d he whispered, handing Rake and Yeader two heavy\nautomatics. \u201cPlant them on the seat. Now this hatchet.\u201d\n\nJoe Yeader straightened with the package in his hand. He broke the\nstring, ripped off the wrapping paper and held out a bright-looking\nhatchet.\n\n\u201cHold it ready!\u201d said Fay. \u201cWe\u2019re turning into Fifth Avenue!\u201d\n\nThe taxi swerved, straightened and lunged northward. Rake sputtered and\nswore as he attempted to open a door. Yeader bent over and tried the\nknob on the other door.\n\n\u201cDid you notice our driver?\u201d asked Fay.\n\n\u201cRed hair and turned-up nose,\u201d said Yeader. \u201cWhat to hell kind of a\nbloody trap did we get into?\u201d\n\nRake turned and pressed his nose against the front glass of the taxi.\nHe turned as Fay reached and jerked down the blind.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Elsie De Groot!\u201d he blurted. \u201cIt\u2019s the dame of the garage!\u201d\n\n\u201cListen!\u201d\n\nA slight noise like a steam-exhaust sounded. Fay reached close by the\nseat. He pressed one knee against Yeader. He nodded comprehendingly.\n\n\u201cThe air\u2019s gettin\u2019 thinner!\u201d exclaimed Rake. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe!\u201d\n\nFay dropped to his knees, swayed, and ran his hand over the bottom of\nthe cab. He curled into a knot with his feet on the seat. He raised a\nhand and indicated for Rake and Yeader to bend down.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be dead!\u201d he whispered. \u201cThere\u2019s a suction pump on\nthe engine that\u2019s exhausting the air from the cab. The driver started\nthe pump when she started the cab. The windows and framework are built\nto withstand enormous outside pressure.\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe taxi came to a sudden halt at a curb. The driver sprang from the\nfront seat, mounted the running-board and pressed a pair of sharp eyes\nagainst the side glass. Fay, Rake and Yeader lay on the cab floor with\ntheir faces shielded by their up-thrown arms.\n\nThe driver swung into the seat, raced the engine, and clicked through\nthe speeds. The taxi darted up Fifth Avenue. It gained Fifty-ninth\nStreet and turned into the Park. It swung the dark curves on its swift\npassage uptown.\n\nFay\u2019s fingers groped along the seat and clasped an automatic. \u201cGet the\nother!\u201d he said into Rake\u2019s ear. \u201cYou, Yeader, take the hatchet and pry\nat the bottom of the door. I\u2019ve got my hand over the suction pipe. We\nwont be suffocated.\u201d\n\nThe ride seemed endless. The taxi rolled from out the foliage of the\nPark and climbed a long hill. It turned northward along street-car\ntracks.\n\n\u201cBroadway!\u201d said Fay, sensing his position. \u201cWe\u2019re going right out\nBroadway.\u201d\n\nRake gasped and pressed a finger across his mouth. He coughed, pounded\nhis chest, and recovered himself. His eyes glared indignantly. He\nwaited till the taxi clattered over a bridge, then he protested:\n\n\u201cLet me out, Chester. I\u2019ll wring that damn girl\u2019s neck! I can\u2019t stand\nthis much longer. There\u2019s no air.\u201d\n\n\u201cSisst!\u201d said Fay. \u201cAre you sure Elsie De Groot is driving the taxi?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure! I\u2019d swear to it!\u201d\n\nFay chuckled. \u201cWe\u2019ll soon know. This is Yonkers. We\u2019ve passed Getty\nSquare. We\u2019re turning now. Now we\u2019re going north. Two turns and then a\nstraight road. I\u2019d know where we are, blindfolded.\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was twenty minutes later when the taxi slowed, backed, then swung\ntoward the left and took a narrow bumpy road. Fay sat up, pressed his\ntoe on the sucking exhaust-pipe and clamped his teeth with a suggestive\ngrind.\n\n\u201cAll ready!\u201d he said nudging Yeader. \u201cSee, we\u2019re rising. We\u2019re going\nacross a bridge. Listen! That\u2019s the New York Central Railroad below us.\nThis is where Stephney was thrown on the freight-train. Now--look out!\u201d\n\nThe taxi dropped down a long, sharp incline with its brakes grinding.\nIt rounded a lodge-gate, swung by a dark, stone house and came to a\nsudden halt in a sheltered courtyard.\n\nThe driver sprang out. Fay braced his feet against the door. He heard\ntwo voices in whispered conversation. A third joined in with a\nprotesting snarl. The handle of the door clicked. A key was inserted.\nThe lock snapped open.\n\nFay bent his knees, aimed at the exact center of the panel and kicked\noutward. He rolled over with the force of his blow. He staggered from\nthe cab with Yeader and Rake scrambling after him.\n\n\u201cGet up your hands!\u201d he exclaimed, jabbing forward the automatic. \u201cUp!\nUp! Up! All three of you!\u201d\n\nRake lunged swiftly and wrapped his arms about the forward figure of a\nstartled group. He went down with the man under him.\n\nThe two figures in front of Fay\u2019s automatic hesitated, spread, and\nbolted to right and left. Fay lowered his gun, fired once at the\nground, then dashed in pursuit of the taxi-driver, whose khaki leggings\nwere a fair mark to follow.\n\nHe gained with each stride. He reached forward, stumbled over a low\nwall, and clutched a coat which was torn from his fingers. He bounded\nacross a roadway, dropped the automatic and made a flying tackle which\nbrought his quarry to the close-cropped grass.\n\n\u201cLie still, you!\u201d he ordered as his fingers closed on a pair of\nflailing arms. \u201cGet down! I think I know you!\u201d\n\n                *       *       *       *       *\n\nFay\u2019s hands gripped with strength. He heard a low moan below him, and\neased the clutch he had fastened upon a thick throat. He wheeled and\nstared toward the courtyard. Rake had already secured his prisoner. The\nbig ex-convict was looking up the road, which merged into gloom and\ndripping trees. A man was bounding along this road, with Yeader close\nbehind him. The Cockney raised his revolver in a slow aim. He lowered\nit and dashed on. A taxi with blazing cones of yellow light swung over\nthe bridge across the railroad track and began descending the grade. It\nslowed. It stopped with a shriek of metal bands on metal.\n\nTwo drivers sprang from the front seat and reached for the man whom\nYeader was pursuing. He sank to his knees in the roadway as other forms\nscrambled from the taxi. He was surrounded by a resolute group of\ntaxi-drivers. Their leader called an order and came running toward the\ntaxi in the courtyard.\n\nFay twisted his fingers in a close collar, ran his hand over the figure\nbelow him and found, in a pocket, a matted red wig. He sprang erect.\n\n\u201cThe mechanic of the garage!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cYou settle one doubt! You\nimpersonated Elsie De Groot!\u201d\n\nThe leader of the drivers who had arrived in the second taxi ran across\nthe courtyard, paused, and stared at Fay\u2019s prisoner. She turned with\nher eyes sweeping the windows of the silent house. She came over the\ngrass.\n\n\u201cJust in time, Miss Elsie!\u201d said Fay. \u201cYou got a man up the road. Who\nwas he?\u201d\n\n\u201cA crook! And this is--\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is one of your mechanics. He resembles you. He must have had\naccess to your desk. He impersonated you by putting on a wig after you\nset Stephney down on Fifth Avenue. He was Ponsardin\u2019s tool. His taxi\nwas equipped with a suction pipe and a set of snap locks on the doors.\nIt was death to enter it. They were after big game tonight.\u201d\n\nThe girl shuddered. She turned away from Fay and his prisoner.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how it all happened,\u201d she said. \u201cI suspected the mechanic\nafter your visit. We followed him tonight. He had a taxi exactly like\nours. We lost him in the Park. We were close behind you. Then--we found\nthe trail again, up above Yonkers. It led here. You see, he had\ndifferent tires than most cars. One was vulcanized on the tread and\nmade a different mark in the dust.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was clever!\u201d\n\nThe girl trembled slightly.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s the third man,\u201d Fay asked, \u201cthe one you looked at before you\ncame over to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s Ponsardin! He\u2019s the owner of the Gray Taxi Company. I\nwonder what will become of it now? I hate to see the boys lose their\njobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t, and you won\u2019t. I\u2019m sure I can fix things so that once in a\nwhile I can drop around and call upon Miss Elsie De Groot--President\nand General Manager of the Gray Taxi Company--which Mr. George Mott\nwill surely take care of, no matter what happens to Ponsardin.\u201d\n\nThe girl seized Fay\u2019s extended hand.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be corking! The Gray Brotherhood has certainly cleared its\nname tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so have you!\u201d said Chester Fay with a smile.",
