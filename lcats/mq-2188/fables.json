Do not enquire\n    The How and Why of things\u2014or higher.\n    Be Virtuous, and neglect the Schools;\n    For Wisdom was but made for fools.\n    Scorn still the shallow Mind that pries\n    In science, art, philosophies;\n    Essays the future to forecast,\n    Forsooth, by study of the past;\n    Maintains the laws should be (what treason!)\n    Compounded by the use of reason;\n    And will advise e\u2019en men of note\n    To govern well by thinking o\u2019t;\n    Avers when honest people chatter\n    That he knows best who knows the matter;\n    And even go so far as state\n    Goats can by thinking mend their fate.\n    So hold this saw before your eyes,\n    Be Good and let who will be wise.\u2019\n\n    Alas, with his own virtue blind,\n    He fail\u2019d to mark the Wolf behind;\n    Who, as he seized and bore him off,\n    Distress\u2019d him with this bitter scoff\u2014\n    \u2018With your high views I sympathise;\n    But better also to be Wise.\u2019\n\n\n\n\n_The truth of Truth_\n\n\n    Within a vast and gloomy Fane\n    There hung a Curtain to the floor,\n    Which fill\u2019d with terror those who came\n    To wonder there or to adore;\n\n    For, as the Priest had often said,\n    Within the chamber dwelt in sooth\n    A breathing Horror, half divine,\n    Half demon, and whose name was Truth.\n\n    And none there were so doughty bold\n    As durst to lift the tapestry;\n    For it was death, he said, to peer\n    Upon the awful Mystery;\n\n    Until one day\u2014oh dreadful hour\u2014\n    Up jump\u2019d a foolish hardy Youth,\n    Who cried, \u2018I care not if I die,\n    But I will have the truth of Truth.\u2019\n\n    There came a Crowd to see the deed\u2014\n    To hear him shriek within and fall;\n    But they were much astonish\u2019d when\n    He found\u2014why Nothing there at all;\n\n    Except indeed upon the floor\n    (Ill fortune take the prying sinner!)\n    A Pasty and a Pot of Beer\n    Which the poor Priest had got for dinner.\n\n\n\n\n_The Man, the Lion, and the Fly_\n\n_Dedicated to Reformers_\n\n\n    There was a Man to wisdom dead\n    Who took a mad thought in his head\u2014\n    \u2018A second Hercles I,\u2019 he said.\n    \u2018Behold,\u2019 he cried, \u2018I will go forth\n    From east to west, from south to north,\n    And with this knotted bludgeon bash\n    The Things that Sting, and those that Gnash\n    Blood-dripping teeth, and Giants glum\n    So mighty that with finger and thumb\n    They pick and eat chance passengers.\n    And I will slay each thing that stirs\n    To grief of man and dole of beast,\n    Until the world from wrong released\n    Pronounce me Emperor at least.\u2019\n\n    But as he spoke, upon the way\n    A casual Lion chanced to stray,\n    Just as on any other day;\n    And he, to measure of his thought\n    In ready deed inferior nought,\n    Sprang at him furious, and they fought.\n\n    Three hours they fought, until the sun\n    Ymounted in the vault begun\n    To make them wish that they had done.\n    \u2018Friend,\u2019 quoth the Lion, \u2018or why foe\n    Upon my word I do not know\u2014\n    If we fight more we melt, I trow.\u2019\n    \u2018A little grace,\u2019 the Man replied,\n    Wiping his brow, \u2018is not denied;\n    You\u2019ll have but little when you\u2019ve died.\u2019\n\n    So each beneath a tree disposed\n    Took ease. The languid Lion dozed.\n    The Man, who should have done likewise\n    (So says the Saga that is wise),\n    Was waked each time he sued repose\n    By a great Fly upon his nose.\n    First in the one ear then in t\u2019other\n    The winged monster buzz\u2019d with bother;\n    The twitching tender nostrils tried,\n    The corners of the lips beside;\n    From lip to eyelid leapt with fuss,\n    Like old dame in an omnibus;\n    Delighted vastly to have met\n    So great a store of unctuous sweat.\n    At last to desperation driven\n    The Man accursed the Fly to Heaven,\n    And with his bludgeon great assay\u2019d\n    To stay the small annoying raid.\n    Wielding to right and left he smote;\n    But still the nimble Fly, remote,\n    Laughed at his anger and enjoy\u2019d\n    Fresh perspiration.\n                      Thus annoy\u2019d,\n    His bludgeon broken on the tree,\n    A helpless, weary wight was he.\n    The Lion rose, refresh\u2019d, with glee;\n    \u2018I\u2019m ready now,\u2019 he said, \u2018my man,\n    To end the work the Fly began.\u2019\n    And this (the Chronicler explains)\n    Is why the Lion still remains.\n\n\n\n\n_Orpheus and the Busy Ones_\n\n_Dedicated to the Public_\n\n\n    Orpheus, the Stygian current cross\u2019d,\n    When Hell stood still to hear him sing,\n    Torn from Eurydice twice lost\n    (Almost by music saved e\u2019er lost)\n    Over the world went wandering.\n    One day, sate on a mountain slope,\n    Weary and sick for want of hope,\n    (Or rather, shall we term it, dead,\n    Since life is gone when hope is sped),\n    He twang\u2019d his lyre; till song sublime\n    Out of the ashes of his prime\n    And fire of grief like Phoenix sprang;\n    And all the startled hillside rang.\n    Aroused, the dew-engrossed Flowers\n    Turn\u2019d to him all their maiden eyes;\n    And from the sweet forgotten bowers\n    Flew forth a thousand Butterflies.\n    The Trees forgot their roots. Beneath,\n    The noisy Crickets of the heath\n    Rub\u2019d each his forehead with amaze\n    To hear one sing such heavenly lays.\n    Under her stone the lumpy Toad\n    Peer\u2019d forth; even the solid sod\n    Grew peopled with emerging Worms\u2014\n    Such power hath Music on all forms.\n    Above, the pinched Pard amort\n    (She had three cublings in a den)\n    Forgot her hunger, and in short\n    Reposed herself to listen then,\n    Upon her furry paws her chin;\n    And from her vantage watch\u2019d the Poet,\n    Delighted, but enraged to know it,\n    While all her spotted sleek of skin\n    Heaved with the pleasure she took in.\n    Not only this, but shall I say \u2019t,\n    The very Hills began debate\n    Whether, to hear the singing clearer,\n    They should not move a little nearer.\n\n    Only, the Bard, to these strange ways\n    Accustom\u2019d, noted with amaze\n    A herd of Hogs that near him fed,\n    Which might for all he sang be dead.\n    He ceased his song and tried the scale\n    To find out where his voice might fail;\n    His lyre divine descanted soon\n    To see the strings were all in tune;\n    Till satisfied that these were right,\n    And at those Hogs astonish\u2019d quite\n    That they not to his conquering lyre,\n    Which all things else did so admire,\n    Gave heed, but routed in the rye\n    As tho\u2019 he had not been close by,\n    He ask\u2019d of them the reason why.\n    \u2018Good friend,\u2019 a Bacon old replied,\n    \u2018We have too much to do beside;\n    The roots are many, the field is wide.\n    Should we neglect this plenteousness\n    We should be wrong, you must confess\u2014\n    The gods some day might give us less.\n    Our girth is great;
