So the spiders fed, and grew, and fed, and grew...._]\n\n\n\n                                       April 18, 1956\n\nDear Ben: It breaks my heart you didn't sign on for this trip. Your\nreplacement, who _calls_ himself an ichthyologist, has only one talent\nthat pertains to fish--he drinks like one. There are nine of us in the\nexpedition, and every one of us is fed up with this joker, Cleveland,\nalready. We've only been on the island a week, and he's gone native,\ncomplete with beard, bare feet and bone laziness. He slops around the\nlagoon like a beachcomber and hasn't brought in a decent specimen yet.\n\nThe island is a bit of paradise, though. Wouldn't be hard to let\nyourself relax under the palms all day instead of collecting blisters\nand coral gashes out in the bright sun of the atoll. No complaints,\nhowever. We aren't killing ourselves, and our little camp is very\ncomfortable. The portable lab is working out fine, and the screened\nsleeping tent-houses have solved the one big nuisance we've suffered\nbefore: _Insects_. I think an entomologist would find more to keep him\nbusy here than we will.\n\nYour ankle should be useable by the time our next supply plane from\nHawaii takes off. If you apply again at the Foundation right now I'm\nsure Sellers and the others will help me get rid of Cleveland, and\nthere'll be an open berth here.\n\nGot to close now. Our amphib jets off in an hour for the return trip.\nHope this note is properly seductive. Come to the isles, boy, and\nlive!--Cordially, Fred\n\n\n\n                                       May 26, 1956\n\nDear Ben: Now, aren't you sorry you didn't take my advice?!!!! I'm\nassuming you read the papers, and also, that too tight a censorship\nhasn't clamped down on this thing yet. Maybe I'm assuming too much on\nthe latter. Anyhow, here's a detailed version from an actual eyewitness.\n\nThat's right! I was right there on the beach when the \"saucer\" landed.\nOnly it looked more like a king-size pokerchip. About six feet across\nand eight inches thick with a little hemispherical dome dead center on\ntop. It hit offshore about seventy-five yards with a splash that sounded\nlike a whale's tail. Jenner and I dropped our seine, waded to shore and\nstarted running along the beach to get opposite it. Cleveland came out\nof the shade and helped us launch a small boat.\n\nWe got within twenty feet of the thing when it started moving out,\nslowly, just fast enough to keep ahead of us. I was in the bow looking\nright at it when the lid popped open with a sound like a cork coming out\nof a wine bottle. The little dome had split. Sellers quit rowing and we\nall hit the bottom of the boat. I peeked over the gunwale right away,\nand it's a good thing. All that came out of the dome was a little cloud\nof flies, maybe a hundred or so, and the breeze picked them up and blew\nthem over us inshore so fast that Cleveland and Sellers never did see\nthem.\n\nI yelled at them to look, but by then the flies were in mingling with\nthe local varieties of sudden itch, and they figured I was seeing\nthings. Cleveland, though, listened with the most interest. It develops\nthat his specialty _is_ entomology. He took this job because he was out\nof work. Don't know how he bluffed his way past the Foundation, but here\nhe is, and it looks like he might be useful after all.\n\nHe was all for going ashore, but Sellers and I rowed after the white\ndisk for awhile until it became apparent we couldn't catch it. It's a\ngood thing we didn't. A half hour later, Olafsen caught up to it in the\npower launch. We were watching from shore. It was about a half mile out\nwhen Ole cut his speed. Luckily he was alone. We had yelled at him to\npick us up and take us along, but he was too excited to stop. He passed\nus up, went out there and boom!\n\nIt wasn't exactly an A-bomb, but the spray hit us a half mile away, and\nthe surface wave swamped us.\n\nSellers radioed the whole incident to Honolulu right away, and they are\nsending out a plane with a diver, but we don't think he'll find\nanything. Things really blew! So far we haven't even found any\nidentifiable driftwood from the launch, let alone Ole's body or traces\nof the disk.\n\nMeanwhile, Cleveland has come to believe my story, and he's out prowling\naround with an insect net. Most energy he's shown in weeks.\n\n\n\nMay 28--Looks like this letter will be delayed a bit. We are under\nquarantine. The government plane came this morning. They sent along a\ndiver, two reporters and a navy officer. The diver went down right away,\nbut it's several hundred feet deep out there and slants off fast. This\nisland is the tip of a sunken mountain, and the diver gave up after less\nthan an hour. Personally I think a couple of sharks scared him off, but\nhe claims there's so much vegetable ruck down there he couldn't expect\nto find anything smaller than the launch's motor.\n\nCleveland hasn't found anything unusual in his bug net, but everyone is\nexcited here, and you can guess why.\n\nWhen the \"saucer\" reports stopped cold about a year ago, you'll\nremember, it made almost as much news for a while as when they were\nfirst spotted. Now the people out here are speculating that maybe this\ndisc thing came from the same source as the _saucers_, after they had a\nchance to look us over, study our ecology and return to their base.\nCleveland is the one who started this trend of thought with his\nobsession that the flies I reported seeing are an attack on our planet\nfrom someone out in space.\n\nCommander Clawson, the navy officer, doesn't know what to think. He\nwon't believe Cleveland until he produces a specimen of the\n\"fly-from-Mars\", but then he turns around and contradicts himself by\ndeclaring a temporary quarantine until he gets further orders from\nHonolulu.\n\nThe reporters are damned nuisances. They're turning out reams of Sunday\nsupplement type stuff and pestering the devil out of Sparks to let them\nwire it back, but our radio is now under navy control, too.\n\nSure is crowded in the bunk-house with the six additional people, but no\none will sleep outside the screen.\n\n\n\nMay 29--Cleveland thinks he has his specimen. He went out at dawn this\nmorning and came in before breakfast. He's quit drinking but he hasn't\nslept in three days now and looks like hell. I thought he was getting\nhis fancy imagination out of the bottle, but the soberer he got the more\nworried he looked over this \"invasion\" idea of his.\n\nNow he claims that his catch is definitely a sample of something new\nunder our particular sun. He hustled it under a glass and started\nclassifying it. It filled the bill for the arthropods, class Insecta. It\nlooked to me, in fact, just like a small, ordinary blowfly, except that\nit has green wings. And I mean _green_, not just a little iridescent\ncolor.\n\nCleve very gently pulled one wing off and we looked at it under low\npower. There is more similarity to a leaf than to a wing. In the bug's\nback is a tiny pocket, a sort of reservoir of the green stuff, and\nCleve's dissection shows tiny veins running up into the wings. It seems\nto be a closed system with no connection with the rest of the body\nexcept the restraining membrane.\n\nCleveland now rests his extraterrestrial origin theory on an idea that\nthe green stuff is chlorophyll. If it is chlorophyll, either Cleve is\nright or else he's discovered a new class of arthropods. In other\nrespects the critter is an ordinary biting and sucking bug with the\npotentials of about a deerfly for making life miserable. The high-power\nlens showed no sign of unusual or malignant microscopic life inside or\nout of the thing. Cleve can't say how bad a bite would be, because he\ndoesn't have his entomologist kit with him, and he can't analyze the\nsecretion from the poison gland.\n\nThe commander has let him radio for a botanist and some micro-analysis\nequipment.\n\nEveryone was so pitched up that Cleve's findings have been rather\nanti-climactic. I guess we were giving more credence to the\nspace-invader theory than we thought. But even if Cleve has proved it,\nthis fly doesn't look like much to be frightened over. The reporters are\nclamoring to be let loose, but the quarantine still holds.\n\n\n\nJune 1--By the time the plane with the botanist arrived we were able to\ngather all the specimens of _Tabanidae viridis_ (Cleveland's\ndesignation) that he wanted. Seems like every tenth flying creature you\nmeet is a green \"Tabby\" now.\n\nThe botanist helped Cleve and me set up the bio kit, and he confirmed\nCleve's guess. The green stuff is chlorophyll. Which makes Tabby quite a\nbug.\n\nKyser, the youngest reporter, volunteered to let a Tabby bite him. It\ndid without too much coaxing. Now he has a little, itchy bump on his\nwrist, and he's happily banging away at his typewriter on a story\ntitled, \"I Was Bitten by the Bug from Space!\" That was hours ago, and we\nhaven't learned anything sinister about the green fly except that it\ndoes have a remarkable breeding ability.\n\nOne thing the reporter accomplished: we can go outside the screened\nquarters now without wondering about catching space-typhus.\n\n\n\nJune 2--The quarantine was probably a pretty good idea. Cleve has turned\nup some dope on Tabby's life cycle that makes us glad all over that we\nare surrounded by a thousand miles of salt water. Tabby's adult life is\nonly a couple of days, but she is viviparous, prolific (some thousand\nyoung at a sitting), and her green little microscopic babies combine the\nbest survival features of spores and plankton, minus one: they don't\nlive in salt water. But they do very well almost anyplace else. We have\nwatched them grow on hot rocks, leaves, in the sand and best of all,\nfiltered down a little into the moist earth.\n\nThey grow incredibly fast with a little sun, so the chlorophyll is\nbiologically justified in the life-cycle. This puzzled us at first,\nbecause the adult Tabby turns into a blood-sucking little brute.\nDeprived of any organic matter, our bottled specimens die in a short\ntime, in or out of the sunlight, indicating the green stuff doesn't\nprovide them with much if any nourishment after they are full-grown.\n\nNow we are waiting for a supply of assorted insecticides to find the\nbest controls over the pests. The few things we had on hand worked quite\nwell, but I guess they aren't forgetting our sad experience with DDT a\nfew years back.\n\nThe Tabbies now outnumber all the other insects here, and most outside\nwork has been halted. The little green devils make life miserable\noutside the tent-houses. We have built another screened shelter to\naccommodate the latest arrivals. We are getting quite a fleet of\namphibian aircraft floating around our lagoon. No one will be allowed to\nreturn until we come up with all the answers to the question of\ncontrolling our insect invasion.\n\nCleveland is trying to convince Sellers and the commander that we should\nget out and send in atomic fire to blow the whole island into the sea.\nThey forwarded his suggestion to the U. N. committee which now has\njurisdiction, but they wired back that if the insect is from space, we\ncouldn't stop other discs from landing on the mainlands. Our orders are\nto study the bug and learn all we can.\n\nOpinion is mixed here. I can't explain the flying disc unless it's\nextraterrestrial, but why would an invader choose an isolated spot like\nthis to attack? Cleve says this is just a \"test patch\" and probably\nunder surveillance. But why such an innocuous little fly if they mean\nbusiness?\n\nThe newsmen are really bored now. They see no doom in the bugs, and\nsince they can't file their stories they take a dim view of the\nquarantine. They have gotten up an evening fishing derby with the crew\nmembers of the planes. Have to fish after dusk. The Tabbies bite too\noften as long as the sun is up.\n\nCleve has turned into a different man. He is soft-spoken and intense.\nHis hands tremble so much that he is conducting most of his work by\nverbal directions with the botanist and me to carry them out. When his\nsuggestion about blowing up the atoll was turned down he quit talking\nexcept to conduct his work. If things were half as ominous as he makes\nout we'd be pretty worried.\n\n\n\nJune 4--The spray planes got here and none too soon. We were running out\nof drinking water. The Tabbies got so thick that even at night a man\nwould get stung insane if he went outside the screen.\n\nThe various sprays all worked well. This evening the air is relatively\nclear. Incidentally, the birds have been having a feast. Now the gulls\nare congregating to help us out like they did the Mormons in the cricket\nplague. The spiders are doing all right for themselves, too. In fact,\nnow that we have sprayed the place the spiders and their confounded webs\nare the biggest nuisance we have to contend with. They are getting fat\nand sassy. Spin their webs between your legs if you stand still a minute\ntoo long. Remind me of real estate speculators in a land boom, the\nlittle bastardly opportunists. As you might gather, I don't care for\nbrothers Arachnidae. They make everyone else nervous, too. Strangely,\nCleveland, the entomologist, gets the worst jolt out of them. He'll\nstand for minutes at the screen watching them spin their nasty webs and\nskipping out to de-juice a stray Tabby that the spray missed. And he'll\nmutter to himself and scowl and curse them. It is hard to include them\nas God's creatures.\n\nCleve still isn't giving out with the opinions. He works incessantly and\nhas filled two notebooks full of data. Looks to me like our work is\nalmost done.\n\n\n\nAugust 7, Year of our Lord 1956--To whom it will never concern: I can no\nlonger make believe this is addressed to my friend, Ben Tobin. Cleveland\nhas convinced me of the implications of our tragedy here. But somehow it\ngives me some crazy, necessary ray of hope to keep this journal until\nthe end.\n\nI think the real horror of this thing started to penetrate to me about\nJune 6. Our big spray job lasted less than 24 hours, and on that morning\nI was watching for the planes to come in for a second try at it when I\nnoticed the heavy spider webbing in the upper tree foliage. As I looked\na gull dove through the trees, mouth open, eating Tabbies. Damned if the\nwebs didn't foul his wings. At first he tore at them bravely and it\nlooked like he was trying to swim in thin mud--sort of slow motion. Then\nhe headed into a thick patch, slewed around at right angles and did a\ncomplete flip. Instantly three mammoth spiders the size of my fist\npounced out on him and trussed him up before he could tear loose with\nhis feet.\n\nHis pitiful squawking was what made me feel that horror for the first\ntime. And the scene was repeated more and more often. The planes dusted\nus with everything they had, and it cut down the Tabbies pretty well\nagain, but it didn't touch the spiders, of course.\n\nAnd then our return radio messages started getting very vague. We were\ntransmitting Cleve's data hourly as he compiled it, and we had been\ngetting ordinary chatter and speculation from the Honolulu operator at\nthe end of our message. That stopped on the sixth of June. Since then,\nwe've had only curt acknowledgements of our data and sign-offs.\n\nAt the same time, we noticed that complete censorship on news of our\nsituation and progress apparently hit all the long-wave radio\nbroadcasts. Up to that time the newscasts had been feeding out a dilute\nand very cautious pablum about our fight against Tabby. Immediately when\nwe noticed this news blind spot Cleve went all to pieces and started\ndrinking again.\n\nCleve, Sellers and I had the lab tent to ourselves, having moved our\nbunks in there, so we got a little out of touch with the others. It\nwasn't the way Sellers and I liked it, but none of us liked the trip\nfrom lab to living quarters any more, although it was only fifty feet or\nso.\n\nThen Sparks moved in, too. For the same reason. He said it was getting\non his nerves running back and forth to the lab to pick up our outgoing\nbulletins. So he shifted the generator, radio gear and all over to a\ncorner of the lab and brought in his bunk.\n\nBy the tenth of June we could see that the spraying was a losing battle.\nAnd it finally took the big tragedy to drive home the truth that was all\nabout us already. When the crew got ready to go out to their planes on\nthe eleventh, everyone except the four of us in the lab tent was drafted\nto help clear webs between the tents and the beach. We could hear them\nshouting from tent to tent as they made up their work party. We could no\nlonger see across the distance. Everywhere outside, vision was obscured\nby the grayish film of webs on which little droplets caught the tropical\nsun like a million tiny mirrors. In the shade it was like trying to peer\nthrough thin milk, with the vicious, leggy little shadows skittering\nabout restlessly.\n\nAs usual in the morning, the hum of the Tabbies had risen above the\nnormal jungle buzzing, and this morning it was the loudest we'd heard\nit.\n\nWell, we heard the first screen door squeak open, and someone let out a\nwhoop as the group moved out with brooms, palm fronds and sticks to\nsnatch a path through the nightmare of spider webs. The other two doors\nopened and slammed, and we could hear many sounds of deep disgust voiced\namid the grunts and thrashings.\n\nThey must have been almost to the beach when the first scream reached\nus. Cleve had been listening in fascination, and the awful sound tore\nhim loose of his senses. He screamed back. The rest of us had to sit on\nhim to quiet him. Then the others outside all began screaming--not\nwords, just shattering screams of pure terror, mixed with roars of pain\nand anger. Soon there was no more anger. Just horror. And in a few\nminutes they died away.\n\n\n\nSellers and Sparks and I looked at each other. Cleve had vomited and\npassed out. Sparks got out Cleve's whiskey, and we spilled half of it\ntrying to get drinks into us.\n\nSparks snapped out of it first. He didn't try to talk to us. He just\nwent to his gear, turned on the generator and warmed up the radio. He\ntold Honolulu what had happened as we had heard it.\n\nWhen he finished, he keyed over for an acknowledgment. The operator said\nto hold on for a minute. Then he said they would _try_ to dispatch an\nair task force to get us off, but they couldn't be sure just when.\n\nWhile this was coming in Cleve came to his senses and listened. He was\ndeadly calm now, and when Honolulu finished he grabbed the mike from\nSparks, cut in the TX and asked, \"Are they landing discs on the\nmainlands?\"\n\nThe operator answered, \"Sorry, that's classified.\"\n\n\"For God's sake,\" Cleve demanded, \"if you are ready to write us off you\ncan at least answer our questions. Are there any of the green\nsonsofbitches on the mainland?\"\n\nThere was another little pause, and then, \"Yes.\"\n\nThat was all. Sparks ran down the batteries trying to raise them again\nfor more answers, but no response. When the batteries went dead he\nchecked the generator that had kicked off. It was out of gasoline. The\ndrums were on the beach. Now we were without lights, power and juice for\nour other radios.\n\nWe kept alive the first few days by staying half drunk. Then Cleve's\ncase of whiskey gave out and we began to get hungry. Sparks and Sellers\nset fire to one of our straw-ticking mattresses and used it as a torch\nto burn their way over to the supply tent about thirty feet away. It\nworked fairly well. The silky webs flashed into nothing as the flames\nhit them, but they wouldn't support the fire, and other webs streamed\ndown behind the two. They had to burn another mattress to get back with\na few cases of food.\n\nThen we dug a well under the floor of our tent. Hit water within a few\nfeet. But when we cut through the screen floor it cost us sentry duty.\nWe had to have one person awake all night long to stamp on the spiders\nthat slipped in around the edge of the well.\n\nThrough all of this Cleveland has been out on his feet. He has just\nstood and stared out through the screen all day. We had to force him to\neat. He didn't snap out of it until this morning.\n\nSparks couldn't stand our radio silence any longer, so he talked Sellers\ninto helping him make a dash for the gas drums on the beach. They set\nfire to two mattresses and disappeared into the tunnel of burned webs\nthat tangled and caved in behind them.\n\nWhen they were gone, Cleveland suddenly came out of his trance and put a\nhand on my shoulder. I thought for a moment he was going to jump me, but\nhis eyes were calm. He said, \"Well, Fred, are you convinced now that\nwe've been attacked?\"\n\nI said, \"It makes no sense to me at all. Why these little flies?\"\n\nCleve said, \"They couldn't have done better so easily. They studied our\necology well. They saw that our greatest potential enemy was the insect\npopulation, and the most vicious part of it was the spider. _Tabanidae\nviridis_ was not sent just to plague us with horsefly bites. Tabby was\nsent to multiply and feed the arachnids. There are durable species in\nall climates. And if our botanist were still alive he could explain in\ndetail how long our plant life can last under this spider infestation.\n\n\"Look for yourself,\" he said pointing outside. \"Not only are the regular\npollenizing insects doomed, but the density of those webs will choke out\neven wind pollinated grains.\"\n\nHe stared down our shallow well hole and stamped on a small, black, flat\nspider that had slithered under the screening. \"I suppose you realize\nthe spiders got the others. Down here in the tropics the big varieties\ncould do it by working together. Sellers and Sparks won't return. Sounds\nlike they got through all right, but they'll be bitten so badly they\nwon't try to get back.\"\n\nAnd even as he spoke we heard one of the aircraft engines start up. The\nsound was muffled as under a bed quilt.\n\nCleve said, \"I don't blame them. I'd rather die in the sun, too. The\nbeach should be fairly clear of webs. We've got one mattress left. What\ndo you say?\"\n\nHe's standing there now holding the mattress with the ticking sticking\nout. I don't think one torch will get us through. But it will be worth a\ntry for one more look at the sun.",
