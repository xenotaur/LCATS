Asks others: \u201cWhich of you can\ndescribe the backbone?\u201d\n\n_Geraldine_ (raises hand, standing on one foot in her eagerness to\nanswer). \u201cThe backbone is something that holds up the head and ribs,\nand keeps you from having legs clear up your neck.\u201d\n\n_Teacher._ \u201cNow, children, what is a cat covered with? Is it wool? Is\nit fur? Is it feathers?

This rapid motion through space\ncauses it to perspire. This is called dew.\u201d\n\n_Teacher._ \u201cHenry, where was the Declaration of Independence signed?\u201d\n\n_Henry._ \u201cAt the bottom, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n_Teacher._ \u201cWhat is mathematics, Isaac?\u201d\n\n_Isaac._ \u201cDunno.\u201d\n\n_Ira._ \u201cMe neither.\u201d\n\n_Teacher._ \u201cWell, mathematics is the science that treats of measurement\nor numbering. For instance: If it takes one man twelve days to build a\nhouse, then twelve men can build it in one day. That\u2019s mathematics.\u201d\n\n(Isaac and Ira put heads together over pencil and paper while teacher\nasks next question.)\n\n_Teacher._ \u201cBessie, if your mother bought four baskets of grapes, the\ndealer\u2019s price being a quarter a basket, how much would the purchase\ncost her?\u201d\n\n_Bessie._ \u201cYou never can tell. Ma\u2019s great at a bargain.\u201d\n\n(Isaac and Ira wave their hands to attract attention.)\n\n_Teacher._ \u201cWell, Isaac? Well, Ira?\u201d\n\n_Isaac._ \u201cSay Miss Fitzimmons, me\u2019n Ira\u2019s figgered out that two hundred\nand eighty-eight men will build it in one hour; seventeen thousand two\nhundred and eighty, in a minute, and--\u201d\n\n_Ira_ (interrupts). \u201cAnd one million, thirty-six thousand eight hundred\nmen will put it up in a second, an\u2019--\u201d\n\n_Teacher._ \u201cThere, that will do--that\u2019s quite enough. I see you\nunderstand the meaning of mathematics fully.\u201d\n\n_Curiosity_ (raises hand and asks). \u201cPlease, teacher, did you ever see\na stone step, or a bed spring, or a apple turn over?\u201d\n\n_Teacher._ \u201cCuriosity Cornhusk, I want you to stop asking questions at\nonce. Don\u2019t you know that curiosity once killed a cat?\u201d (Curiosity is\nthoughtful.) \u201cChildren, you may all take your seats.\u201d\n\n_Curiosity._ \u201cPlease, teacher, what was it the cat wanted to know?\u201d\n\n_Teacher_ (sinks into chair). \u201cSomebody bring me a glass of water,\nquick!\u201d\n\n(Geraldine gravely goes to pail in the corner and brings a large tin\ndipper full. Teacher revives.)\n\n_Teacher._ \u201cChildren I wanted to speak to you about that poor family\nwho have just moved into the old brown house in the Hollow. The father\nis just getting up from a sick-bed and not able to work yet and I\nhear there\u2019s scarcely a thing to eat in the house, and to-morrow is\nThanksgiving, you know. I do wish we could send them a good dinner. Can\nany of you think of a way to manage it without asking too much of our\nparents?\u201d\n\n(A loud knock is heard at the outer door. While teacher answers it\nscholars occupy themselves with throwing spit-balls, and various pranks\nof school children. She returns.)\n\n_Teacher._ \u201cThere are two automobiles just down the hill. They got off\nthe main road by mistake, and one of them is broken down, and the men\nare trying to get it fixed up. They wanted to know if there was any\nplace near here where they could get something to eat. The one at the\ndoor says they\u2019re \u2018positively starving,\u2019 and would be willing to pay\na good round sum for anything fit to eat. You know there is no house\nnearer than old Mr. Dawson\u2019s and--\u201d\n\n_Annabel._ \u201cDon\u2019t send \u2019em there, teacher; Mis\u2019 Dawson is just doin\u2019\nher washin\u2019 to-day, and she\u2019ll most likely have a cold bite.\u201d\n\n_Teacher._ \u201cThat\u2019s true--and the next place is Mr. Temple\u2019s--\u201d\n\n_Curiosity._ \u201cI saw \u2019em drivin\u2019 off to town as I came by, an\u2019 the house\nwas all shut up.\u201d\n\n_Teacher._ \u201cThen there\u2019s quite a stretch between there and your place,\nBessie.\u201d\n\n_Bessie._ \u201cMercy! Don\u2019t send them there, Miss Fitzimmons. Mother\u2019s\nmakin\u2019 mince-meat and cookin\u2019 up pumpkin for pies, and she\u2019d be all\nupset.\u201d\n\n_Teacher._ \u201cWell, it appears there isn\u2019t very good promise of lunch\nfor these wayfarers unless we help them out. What do you say if we\nsell our lunches to them and take the proceeds to buy supplies for the\nfolks down in the Hollow? We only have a short session after recess on\naccount of the holiday, so you wouldn\u2019t get so terribly hungry before\nyou go home. I\u2019ll leave you here for awhile, and if you decide to make\nthis sacrifice you can place your lunches on my desk.\u201d\n\n(Scholars immediately begin discussion; some for, some against proposed\ndisposal of lunches; all talking at once and moving about.)\n\n(Presently Annabel rises, sighs and slowly advances to desk, placing\nbasket there, and saying:) \u201cI hate to give up that piece of pumpkin\npie, but I couldn\u2019t relish it thinking of that Hollow family; I\u2019ve been\nhollow myself.\u201d (This is funnier if the speaker is a stout girl.)\n\n_Bessie_ (follows her example). \u201cAll I hope is that the stew don\u2019t all\nget et up before I get home to-day.\u201d\n\n_Curiosity._ \u201cGuess I\u2019ll keep mine.\u201d\n\n_Dennis._ \u201cI love my lunch, but oh! them hungry kids.\u201d (Goes forward.)\n\n_Geraldine._ \u201cGuess I\u2019m as generous as anybody.\u201d (Adds her lunch.)\n\n_Etta_ to _Curiosity_. \u201cYou\u2019d ought to be ashamed of yourself.\u201d\n(Arises.) \u201cMy lunch is out in the cloak-room; I\u2019ll go get it.\u201d\n\n(While she is gone, Curiosity puts her lunch with the rest, sighing:)\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it, but I guess I\u2019ll die like that Curiosity cat; I\u2019ll be\nso hungry.\u201d (Thoughtfully.) \u201cWonder what that cat _did_ want to know\nanyhow.\u201d\n\n_Joshua._ \u201cGuess if they can stand them biscuits of Sis\u2019s, I oughtn\u2019t\nto kick.\u201d\n\n(Etta returns with huge basket, which she deposits with an air of\nimportance on the desk. Looks contemptuously at Curiosity.)\n\n_Fanny._ \u201cAnd I bet you we won\u2019t have nothin\u2019 but fried praties and\nonions for supper. But maybe _they_ ain\u2019t got even them.\u201d (Puts bag\nwith others.)\n\n(Isaac and Ira go up together, saying:) \u201cAnd there\u2019s ours.\u201d\n\n_Henry._ \u201cHere\u2019s mine, too.\u201d\n\n_Etta_ to _Curiosity_. \u201cThere, you see; everybody\u2019s give up their lunch\nbut you, you little stingy, contrary, stubborn, selfish, tight-fisted,\nover-fed, pie-faced pig you--\u201d\n\n_Curiosity._ \u201cAre you through?\u201d\n\n_Etta._ \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n_Curiosity._ \u201cAin\u2019t you got nothin\u2019 more to say?\u201d\n\n_Etta._ \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n_Curiosity._ \u201cWell, all of them things you called me you are. I put my\nlunch there when you went after yours.\u201d\n\n_Etta_ (repentently). \u201cOh, I take it all back.\u201d\n\n_Curiosity_ (cordially). \u201cAll right, you\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n\n(Enter teacher.)\n\n_Teacher._ \u201cAh, this looks as if everybody has been generous. I\u2019m proud\nof you. You\u2019re all true friends in need. But I was sure you\u2019d do it, so\nI spoke to the gentleman at the door and he says, he will consider it\na bargain at any price we say, and will be back with his friends soon.\nNow for the recitations. Each one of you try to recite something, if\nonly a stanza. And after all have recited, I will call for the fire\ndrill, and all be ready to respond immediately. Don\u2019t hesitate, do as\nyou would if the building was really on fire. Now, Annabel you\u2019re first\non the roll, so you begin speaking.\u201d\n\nAnnabel comes forward, bows, announces: \u201cMary\u2019s Little Lamb.\u201d Bows\nagain, and recites as follows:\n\n  \u201cSome folks say that fleas is black,\n    But that ain\u2019t true I know,\n  For Mary had a little lamb\n    Its fleas was white as snow.\u201d\n\n_Teacher._ \u201cNow Bessie, it\u2019s your turn.\u201d\n\n_Bessie._ \u201cMe and Curiosity\u2019s got one together.\u201d\n\n_Curiosity._\n\n  \u201cI asked my Pa a simple thing,\n    Where holes in doughnuts go?\n  Pa read his paper, then he said,\n    \u2018Oh, you\u2019re too young to know.\u2019\u201d\n\n_Bessie._\n\n  \u201cI asked my Ma about the wind,\n    Why you can\u2019t see it blow?\n  Ma thought a moment, then she said,\n    \u2018Oh, you\u2019re too young to know.\u2019\u201d\n\n_Both together._\n\n  \u201cNow why on earth do you suppose\n    They went and licked us so.\n  Ma asked, \u2018Where is that jam?\u2019 I said,\n    \u2018Oh, you\u2019re too young to know.\u2019\u201d\n\n_Teacher._ \u201cNow, Dennis.\u201d\n\n_Dennis recites._\n\n  \u201cThe lady in the street-car\n    Was glaring down at me,\n  Because I chanced to have a seat\n    And she did not, you see.\n\n  \u201cBut I rose very quickly\n    And offered her my seat.\n  \u2019Twas a question whether she or I\n    Should stand upon _my_ feet.\n                                      Ouch!\u201d\n\n_Teacher._ \u201cNow we\u2019ll have yours, Etta.\u201d\n\n_Etta._ \u201cPlease, teacher, I ain\u2019t thought of mine yet.\u201d (Nudges Fanny.)\n\u201cYou g\u2019wan, Fanny.\u201d\n\n_Fanny_ (grinning and twisting apron).\n\n  \u201cHyer Oi stand, all ragged and dirty,\n  Ask me me name, an\u2019 Oi\u2019ll run like a turkey.\u201d\n\n_Teacher._ \u201cGeraldine next.\u201d\n\n_Geraldine._\n\n  \u201cWhen mother was a little maid\n    She was so very good,\n  I really often think that she\n    Must have been made of wood.\n\n  \u201c_She_ never, never played a trick\n    On her pet pussy \u2018Tib,\u2019\n  _She_ would not tease; she would not tell\n    The tiniest little fib.\n\n  \u201c_She_ always kept her dresses clean,--\n    Her curls were brushed just right;\n  _She_ never cried and coaxed that she\n    Might stay up late at night.\n\n  \u201cAnd very often when I\u2019ve been\n    In mischief and been bad,\n  I think, \u2018Ain\u2019t it an _awful shame_\n    That I took after Dad.\u2019\u201d\n\n_Teacher._ \u201cNow, Henry.\u201d\n\n_Henry_ (very rapidly and jerkily).\n\n  \u201cThere was a young girl from Boo Loo\n    Who wanted to catch the two-two.\n  Said the porter, \u2018Don\u2019t hurry, or scurry or worry,\n    It\u2019s a minute or two to two-two.\u2019\u201d\n\n_Teacher._ \u201cIsaac and Ira, I suppose you have one between you?\u201d (They\nnod.) \u201cAll right.\u201d\n\n_Isaac._\n\n  \u201cThe verse you write\n    You say is written.\n\n_Ira._\n\n  You fly your kite\n    But not your kitten.\n\n_Isaac._\n\n  The gas you light\n    Is never litten.\n\n_Ira._\n\n  The things you drank\n    Were doubtless drunk.\n\n_Isaac._\n\n  The boy you spank\n    Is never spunk.\n\n_Ira._\n\n  A friend you thank\n    But never thunk.\n\n_Isaac._\n\n  Suppose you speak\n    Then you have spoken.\n\n_Ira._\n\n  But if you sneak\n    You have not snoken.\n\n_Isaac._\n\n  The shoes that squeak\n    Have never squoken.\u201d\n\n_Teacher._ \u201cWhat is yours, Joshua?\u201d\n\n_Joshua._\n\n  \u201cGrandma, here\u2019s a little gumdrop.\u201d\n    \u201cThank you very much, my sweet,\n  What a thoughtful little boy you are\n    To bring Grandma a treat.\u201d\n\n  \u201cDid you like that gumdrop, Grandma?\u201d\n    \u201cYes, my dear, \u2019twas very nice.\u201d\n  \u201cAin\u2019t it queer now, Towsey didn\u2019t\n    \u2019Cause he spitted it out twice.\u201d\n\n_Teacher._ \u201cDear me, Joshua, perhaps you\u2019d better let me choose your\nnext piece. Now, Etta, if you are ready, we\u2019ll have your piece as the\nfinal recitation.\u201d\n\n_Etta._\n\n  Once there was a little boy, whose name was Robert Reece,\n    And every Friday afternoon he had to speak a piece.\n  So many poems thus he learned, that soon he had a store\n    Of recitations in his head, and still kept learning more.\n\n  And now this is what happened; he was called upon one week\n    And totally forgot the piece he was about to speak!\n  His brain he cudgelled! not a word remained within his head!\n    And so he spoke at random, and this is what he said.\n\n  \u201cMy Beautiful, my Beautiful, who standest proudly by,\n    It was the schooner Hesperus--the breaking waves dashed high!\n  Why is the Forum crowded? What means this stir in Rome?\n    Under the spreading chestnut tree, there is no place like home.\n\n  \u201cWhen Freedom from her mountain height cried, Twinkle little star,\n    Shoot if you must this old gray head, King Henry of Navarre!\n  Roll on, thou deep and dark blue crested crags of Drachenfels,\n    My name is Norval on the Grampion Hills, ring out wild bells!\u201d\n\n  \u201cIf you\u2019re waking call me early, to be or not to be,\n    The curfew must not ring to-night.

Laughter and\ntalking is heard, followed by the entrance of the automobile party of\nsix persons.)\n\n_Mrs. Morrison_, a stout, elderly lady.\n\n_May Morrison_, her daughter, affected young lady.\n\n_Betty Bennet_, May\u2019s friend.\n\n_Charley Chadwick_, May\u2019s beau, something of a \u201csmarty,\u201d but a \u201cgood\nsort.\u201d\n\n_Mr. and Mrs. Brown_, an affectionate couple.\n\n\n_May Morrison_ (ecstatically). \u201cOh, what a perfectly darling place! The\nveritable little old red schoolhouse.\u201d\n\n(Miss Fitzsimmons sniffs audibly as she looks her over disdainfully.)\n\n_Charley Chadwick_ (taking her hand and skipping with her down the\naisle, sings):\n\n  \u201cSchool-days, school-days\n    Dear old Golden Rule days.\n  Readin\u2019 and writin\u2019 and \u2019rithmetic,\n    Taught to the tune of the hick\u2019ry stick.\n  You were my queen in calico,\n    I was your bashful, bare-foot beau,\n  And you wrote on my slate, \u2018I love you, Joe,\u2019\n    When we were a couple of kids.\u201d\n\n_Mrs. Morrison_ (advances to the teacher\u2019s desk). \u201cGood morning.\nMiss--ah?\u201d\n\n_Teacher_ (shortly). \u201cFitzsimmons.\u201d\n\n_Mrs. M._ \u201cAh yes, of course. You are the teacher, I presume?\u201d (Miss\nFitzsimmons nods.) \u201cAwfully nice of you to extend your hospitality to\nus in this way.\u201d\n\n_Mr. Brown_ (joins in). \u201cYes, indeed, its great of you to help us out.\u201d\n\n_Charley_ (facetiously). \u201cOh, no, Brown; this is a case of our being\n\u2018taken in.\u2019\u201d\n\n(The girls giggle.)\n\n_Miss Fitzsimmons_ (after a contemptuous glance in his direction,\nresponds quite graciously to the others). \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m glad we could\nbe of service to you, and the children are pleased at the prospect of\nhelping the poor family, which your generosity has made possible.\u201d\n\n_Mr. Brown._ \u201cOh, don\u2019t mention it.\u201d\n\n_Miss Fitzsimmons._ \u201cAnd you\u2019ll find all the lunches on those seats\u201d\n(pointing to them). \u201cI hope you will enjoy them.\u201d (Turns to her papers.\nThe others murmur their thanks and proceed to remove their wraps, all\nbut Mrs. Brown, who draws her fur more closely about her throat.)\n\n_Mr. Brown._ \u201cCold, dearie?\u201d\n\n_Mrs. B._ (plaintively). \u201cSimply freezing, honey.\u201d\n\n_Charley_ (aside to May). \u201cBuzz! Buzz!\u201d\n\n_Mr. Brown_ (bustling about). \u201cWhere is the radiator, anyhow?\u201d\n\n_Miss Fitzsimmons._ \u201cThe _stove\u2019s_ up there at the other end of the\nroom.\u201d\n\n_Charley._ \u201cOh, I say, Brown, let\u2019s turn our attention to the baskets\nnow and hug the stove afterwards. I\u2019m completely caved in.\u201d\n\n(Mr. and Mrs. Brown gracefully agree to this, and the opening of the\nbaskets, bags and kettles begins.)\n\n(The door in view of the audience opens on a crack and Curiosity\u2019s\nhooded head appears unnoticed by the occupants of the schoolroom, and\none after another the curious faces of the children appear.)\n\n_Betty_ (gleefully). \u201cOh! Oh! a cup of cranberry jelly.\u201d (Takes it out.)\n\n_May._ \u201cAnd here are two simply luscious-looking cakes with chocolate\non top.\u201d\n\n_Charley._ \u201cHorray! pumpkin pie.\u201d\n\n_Mrs. Brown._ \u201cOh, lovey, look! A great big, juicy cruller.\u201d (Holds it\nup.)\n\n_Mr. Brown._ \u201cWe\u2019ll eat it together over by the stove, pet.\u201d\n\n_Charley._ \u201cGoing to eat the _whole_ of it?\u201d\n\n_May._ \u201cOh, Charley, you funny funny thing!\u201d\n\n(They group themselves about and arrange the viands on napkins found in\nthe baskets.)\n\n(Just then Charley espies the faces at the door, which promptly bob out\nof sight, except Curiosity\u2019s.)\n\n_Charley._ \u201cHello there, sis! How\u2019s all the pigs up at your place?\u201d\n\n_Curiosity._ \u201cOh, pretty well, thank you. How\u2019s all your folks?\u201d\n\n(Betty claps her hands.) \u201cGood! good!\u201d (The others laugh, Charley\nincluded.)\n\n_Charley._ \u201cOh, I say! What\u2019s your name, anyhow?\u201d\n\n_Curiosity._ \u201cSame as father\u2019s.\u201d\n\n_Charley._ \u201cYes, I know that, but what\u2019s father\u2019s now?\u201d\n\n_Curiosity._ \u201cSame\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\n_Charley._ \u201cWell, but what do they say when they call you to breakfast.\u201d\n\n_Curiosity._ \u201cThey don\u2019t never call me. I allers git there first.\u201d\n\n_Teacher._ \u201cWhy, Curiosity, I thought you had gone home.\u201d\n\n_Curiosity._ \u201cNo\u2019m. We thought we\u2019d wait and take our baskets home\nafter they\u2019re through with \u2019em.\u201d\n\n_Mrs. Morrison._ \u201cOh, let them stay, Miss--Persimmons.\u201d\n\n_Teacher._ \u201c_Fitz_simmons.\u201d\n\n_Mrs. Morrison._ \u201cOh, yes, of course, Fitzsimmons. Let them all come\nin; there\u2019s plenty here for all of us and them, too.\u201d\n\n_May._ \u201cOh, yes, do. It\u2019ll be a perfect circus.\u201d\n\n(Charley throws wide the door.) \u201cCome in, come in, friends, and help us\neat up your lunches.\u201d\n\n(The children, after much whispering and \u201cyou go first,\u201d troop in\nbashfully, giggling and nudging one another, and the eating commences,\nMrs. Morrison presiding over the distribution of the lunches.)\n\n_Charley_ (munching a sandwich). \u201cMy, but this chicken sandwich is\nprime. Who brought it, anyway?\u201d\n\n_Dennis_ (shyly). \u201cI did.\u201d\n\n_Charley._ \u201cYour own chickens?\u201d\n\n_Dennis._ \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n_Charley._ \u201cI should think you\u2019d hate to chop the heads off the poor\nchickens.\u201d\n\n_Dennis._ \u201cOh, we get around that all right.\u201d\n\n_Charley._ \u201cHow, now?\u201d\n\n_Dennis._ \u201cOh, we chop the chickens off.\u201d\n\n(The grown-ups all laugh delightedly.)\n\n_Curiosity_ (intently regarding Miss May\u2019s enjoyment of the generous\nportions of lunch at her place and Charley\u2019s attentions toward her),\nasks Mr. Brown, \u201cIs he going to marry her?\u201d (indicating them by a nod\nof her head).\n\n_Mr. Brown._ \u201cI believe so.\u201d\n\n_Curiosity._ \u201cAnd buy her everything?\u201d\n\n_Mr. Brown._ \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n_Curiosity._ \u201cClo\u2019s and dinners and ice-cream and things?\u201d\n\n_Mr. Brown._ \u201cI presume so.\u201d\n\n_Curiosity._ \u201cWell, that man\u2019s got lots of courage, ain\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n(Mr. and Mrs. Brown laugh amusedly, and Charley turns from a\nconversation with May to ask), \u201cHello! now what\u2019s the joke?\u201d\n\n_Etta E._ \u201cOh, its her\u201d (motions to Curiosity), \u201cshe\u2019s et so much of my\ntomato ketshup she\u2019s gettin\u2019 sawcy.\u201d\n\n_Curiosity._ \u201cWell, you et that big apple out of my basket.\u201d\n\n_Etta._ \u201cWell, here, plant the seeds and you can have a whole orchard.\u201d\n(Holds them out to her provokingly.)\n\n_Charley_ (to Annabel). \u201cWell, sister, did you make this pie?\u201d\n\n_Annabel._ \u201cNo, sir. Ma did, though, and she\u2019ll write off how if you\nwant me to ask her to.\u201d\n\n_Charley._ \u201cNow that\u2019s kind of you. Pray do. How\u2019d you like a good\nreceipt for catching rabbits?\u201d\n\n_Annabel_ (staring). \u201cWh-y! I--I\u2019d like to have it.\u201d\n\n_Charley._ \u201cWell, you crouch down behind a thick stone wall and make a\nnoise like a turnip.\u201d\n\n_Annabel._ \u201cO--h!\u201d (thinks it over).\n\n_Mr. Brown_ (to Mrs. B.) \u201cIsn\u2019t this blackberry jam delicious,\nsweetness?\u201d (Gives her a spoonful.) \u201cBut you\u2019d know it reminds me of a\npainful blunder I made once when visiting the country, which I never\nwant to repeat.\u201d\n\n_Mrs. Brown._ \u201cDear me! Did you mistake a stranger for an acquaintance,\nhoney?\u201d\n\n_Mr. Brown._ \u201cNo, not exactly that, but I mistook a bumblebee for a\nblackberry.\u201d\n\n_Mrs. Brown._ \u201cOh, my!\u201d\n\n_Annabel_ (to Charley). \u201cI can tell you a better way to catch \u2019em.\u201d\n\n_Charley._ \u201cCatch what?\u201d\n\n_Annabel._ \u201cWhy, them rabbits.\u201d\n\n_Charley._ \u201cHow now?\u201d\n\n_Annabel._ \u201cYou go and sit quietly in a bed of cabbages and look\nnatural.\u201d\n\n(The laugh is on Charley.)\n\n_May_ (to Bessie Bolitsky). \u201cNow I expect you little girls know a\nperfectly awful lot, don\u2019t you? Can you tell me how many ribs you have?\u201d\n\n_Bessie_ (squirming and giggling). \u201cI don\u2019t know, ma\u2019am. I\u2019m so awful\nticklish I never could count \u2019em.\u201d\n\n_Mr. Brown_ (to Fanny). \u201cI hear we pass your house on our way to the\nturnpike. I\u2019d like to stop and see your father about buying some of\nthese apples (eating one). Think he is home?\u201d\n\n_Fanny._ \u201cOh, yes-sir. He\u2019s worrikin\u2019 down at the end of the back lot\nwhere the pigs is. You\u2019ll know father \u2019cause he\u2019s got a hat on.\u201d (A\nburst of laughter.)\n\n_Fanny_ (indignantly). \u201cWell, I don\u2019t see what you\u2019re laughin\u2019 at. The\nhired man\u2019s got on a cap.\u201d\n\n_Mrs. Morrison._ \u201cI suppose you children know lots about history. Now\nwho can tell me the name of the first man?\u201d\n\n_Henry._ \u201cGeorge Washington.\u201d\n\n_Mrs. M._ \u201cWhy do you think George Washington was the first man?\u201d\n\n_Henry._ \u201cBecause he was first in war, first in peace, and first in the\nhearts of his countrymen.\u201d\n\n_Joshua._ \u201cNo, Henry. You\u2019re way off. George Washington couldn\u2019t a\u2019\nbeen the first man \u2019cause my history-book says he married a widow; so\nthere must a\u2019 been another man way ahead of him.\u201d\n\n(Laughter from grown-ups.)\n\n_May._ \u201cYou surely are well informed about Washington. How about\nLincoln?\u201d\n\n_Geraldine._ \u201cWe\u2019s just writing compositions on him to hand in next\nMonday. I\u2019ve got mine here if you\u2019l like to hear it.\u201d\n\n_May._ \u201cI\u2019d simply love to.\u201d\n\n_Betty._ \u201cOh, yes, do read it.\u201d\n\n_Geraldine_ (takes paper out of book and reads). \u201cAbraham Lincoln was\nborn in Kentucky at a very early age. His father moved the family to\nOhio, floating down the Mississippi. If he had not been killed by a\nmurderer he might be living to-day. He was an intelligent man and could\neasily have been President of New York City.\u201d\n\n(The grown-ups try to hide their smiles.)\n\n_May._ \u201cPerfectly remarkable.\u201d\n\n_Mrs. Morrison_ (to Isaac). \u201cHave another sandwich, my boy, or a pickle\nor something.\u201d\n\n_Isaac._ \u201cNo\u2019m, thanks; I\u2019m full.\u201d\n\n_Mrs. M._ \u201cBut surely you are not finished yet. Why here is some\ndelicious pie.\u201d\n\n_Isaac._ \u201cYes\u2019m, I\u2019m saving my neck for that.\u201d\n\n_Mrs. Brown_ (to Annabel). \u201cAnd this little girl has stopped eating,\ntoo. Do take another cake.\u201d\n\n_Annabel_ (with a sigh, as she takes the proffered cake). \u201cWell, I\u2019ve\nquit swallerin\u2019, but I can chaw yet.\u201d\n\n_Mrs. M._ (rising and going to the teacher\u2019s desk, where Miss\nFitzsimmons is lunching while she marks and arranges papers). \u201cWell, my\ndear Miss Fitzgibbons--\u201d\n\n_Teacher._ \u201cFitzsimmons.\u201d\n\n_Mrs. M._ \u201cOh, of course, Fitzsimmons. My dear Miss Fitzsimmons, this\nhas been a most enjoyable and unique occasion to us.\u201d\n\n_Teacher._ \u201cI\u2019m glad, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\n(Mr. and Mrs. Brown join them.)\n\n_Mr. B._ \u201cWe\u2019ll remember it as one of the events of our lives, won\u2019t\nwe, Rosebud?\u201d\n\n_Mrs. B._ \u201cIndeed we shall. It makes one wish she were a little\nschoolgirl once again.\u201d\n\n_Mr. B._ (fondly aside). \u201cAnd I a little schoolboy to carry her books.\u201d\n\n_Mrs. B._ \u201cYou dear, foolish boy.\u201d\n\n_Charley._ \u201cBut, oh, say, Mrs. Morrison, before we go let\u2019s have a game\nof something or other. What say, everybody?\u201d\n\n_May and Betty._ \u201cOh, yes, let\u2019s.\u201d\n\n_Children._ \u201cOh let\u2019s do.\u201d\n\n_Charley._ \u201cWhat shall it be?\u201d\n\n_Children cry._ \u201cRing-around-a-rosey,\u201d \u201cPuss-in-the-corner\u201d and \u201cLondon\nBridge.\u201d\n\n_Charley._ \u201cWell, let\u2019s see; that\u2019s three to choose from. How many say\nRing-around-a-rosey, hold up your hands.\u201d\n\n(A few of the children\u2019s hands are raised.)\n\n_Charley._ \u201cNow Puss-in-the-corner. How many am I bid for\nPuss-in-the-corner?\u201d\n\n(A few more hands are raised.)\n\n_Charley._ \u201cNow for London Bridge. Going--going--gone.\u201d\n\n(The other children and all of the grown-ups hands are raised except\nthe teacher\u2019s and Mrs. Morrison\u2019s, who stand aside laughing.)\n\n_Charley._ \u201cLondon Bridge has it. You come on, too, Mamma Morrison and\nMiss Teacher. Everybody forward. Who\u2019ll be London Bridge? You do, Betty\nand May, and come on, the rest of you. Line up behind me and we\u2019ll\nstorm the bridge.\u201d\n\n(The two young ladies join hands, and the others, headed by\nCharley--Mrs. Morrison and the teacher protestingly joining, coaxed by\nthe children--pass under the arched hands, singing:\n\n  \u201cLondon Bridge is falling down,\n  Falling down, falling down.\n  London Bridge is falling down,\n              My fair lady.\u201d\n\nMay and Betty drop their hands around the person going under the arch\nas the word \u201clady\u201d is sung.)\n\n\n\n  Italicized text is surrounded by underscores: _italics_.\n\n  Obvious typographical errors have been corrected.\n\n  Inconsistencies in hyphenation have been standardized.",
