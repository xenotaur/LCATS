    "body": "Me and \u201cMuley\u201d Bowles and \u201cChuck\u201d Warner are putting a saddle on a\ncolt in the Cross J corral, when \u201cTelescope\u201d Tolliver enters the\nprecincts of said ranch, and we gets our first glimpse of Archibald\nAmes.\n\nArchibald occupies a seat on the buckboard with Telescope, and they\nsoon comes over and climbs on top of the corral fence. Archibald\u2019s\nname fits him\u2014in a way. The length of his first name indicates his\ngirth and his last name his height. He\u2019s one of them persons who you\u2019d\nnever invite to set down, \u2019cause he don\u2019t seem to require no such\nposture.\n\nIt takes him quite a long time to negotiate the top-pole of the\ncorral, and when he does get up there he has to balance\u2014his feet won\u2019t\nreach the next pole. He\u2019s wearing them dinky little pants, with the\nseat of a shoplifter and the knees of Lord Fauntleroy. His calves\nperspire in shiny leggings, and for a hat he wears a libel on the name\nof Stetson.\n\nMuley gives him a passing glance, yanks up another notch on the cinch,\nand grunts\u2014\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll we do with it?\u201d\n\n\u201cLove it to death or render it out,\u201d grunts Chuck. \u201cLooks to me like\none of them playthings for kids that yuh can\u2019t tip over and make it\nstay down. Let\u2019s give this colt a chance to breathe, while we peers a\nlittle closer at this attraction.\u201d\n\nWe ambles over and looks up at the critter\u2019s soles.\n\n\u201cMister Ames,\u201d orates Telescope, \u201cI\u2019m obliged to make yuh used to\nMuley Bowles. He\u2019s the sylph-like critter in woolly chaps. That one\nwith the sad, horse-faced features is Chuck Warner, the anti-George\nWashington of Yaller Rock County, and the other person down there is\nHenry Peck. They\u2019re all harmless.\n\n\u201cBunch, this is Mister Archibald Ames, who is to be with us for a\nspell.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased to meet yuh,\u201d smiles Archie.\n\n\u201cYou ought to be,\u201d agrees Muley. \u201cIt ain\u2019t often that we shows this\nmuch interest in a stranger. What seems to bring yuh hither?\u201d\n\n\u201cI brung him,\u201d states Telescope. \u201cMister Ames is looking for local\ncolor. Sabe?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he done, and is he wanted by Federal, State or county?\u201d asks\nChuck, serious-like, wiggling his ears.\n\nChuck can wiggle his ears just like a mule.\n\n\u201cDone what?\u201d grunts Telescope. \u201cChuck, you boob, don\u2019t yuh know what\nlocal color is?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bite,\u201d grins Chuck. \u201cGo ahead and spring it, Telescope.\u201d\n\nTelescope clears his throat, rolls a cigaret and glares at Chuck, who\nglares right back, and wiggles his ears.\n\n\u201cLook at them ears!\u201d applauds Archibald. \u201cI\u2019d love to get a close-up\nof them.\u201d\n\n\u201cMister,\u201d reproves Chuck, \u201cit ain\u2019t seemly that a stranger should set\non top of a corral and make remarks about the physical failings of a\nnative son. Keep on at the pace you\u2019ve started, and that spell that\nTelescope spoke about can be spelled in four letters: g-o-n-e. Sabe?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got a lot to say about it, now ain\u2019t yuh?\u201d reproves Telescope.\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t nothing around here but a forty-dollar puncher. You got a\nlot of chance to tell visitors where to head in. Come on, Mister Ames,\nand we\u2019ll go up and see the man what owns this ranch, and ain\u2019t no\nmore sense than to pay forty dollars to a runt like that.\u201d\n\nThey climbs down and goes up to the ranch-house.\n\n\u201cHaw! Haw! Haw!\u201d whoops Muley, shaking every ounce of his two hundred\nand forty pounds of bone and lard. \u201cHaw! Haw! \u2018Come on, Mister Ames,\nand we go up to see the man\u2019\u2014haw, haw, haw! You will tell folks where\nto head in at, will yuh?\u201d\n\nMuley is a poet. There might \u2019a\u2019 been as good rhymers as him once upon\na time, but they\u2019re all dead and departed. Muley is the he-buzzard of\nthe flock right now. He hangs on to the side of the corral and wipes\nthe tears out of his eyes.\n\n\u201cGosh!\u201d he snorts. \u201cTelescope sure showed his breeding, Chuck. Yuh\ncould tell he\u2019s been well raised. Sticks his chin up in the air, like\na grouse with a goiter, and proclaims: \u2018Come on with me, Mister Ames.\u2019\nHaw! Haw! Haw!\u201d\n\n\u201cSome day I\u2019m going to reach up and hang my fist on his jaw,\u201d\nproclaims Chuck.\n\n\u201cYou better catch him in bed or carry a ladder with yuh,\u201d says I. \u201cYou\ngot ambition, Chuck, but your height ain\u2019t noways adequate.\u201d\n\nA little later old man Whittaker, who owns the Cross J outfit, comes\nout with Archibald, and them two goes back to town in the buckboard.\nTelescope comes down to the bunk-house and sets down in our midst.\n\nChuck gives him a mean look, and goes on playing solitaire. Telescope\nadmires himself in our cracked shaving-mirror.\n\n\u201cBetter fix your features in your mind, Telescope, \u2019cause you\u2019re sure\ngoing to need a pattern after Chuck gets through with yuh,\u201d laughs\nMuley.\n\n\u201cThat banty little ear-wiggler!\u201d snorts Telescope. \u201cI got a feeling\nthat I ain\u2019t going to punch cows much longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cDead men punch no cows,\u201d states Chuck. \u201cYour perceptions are getting\nclearer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere do yuh feel bad, Telescope?\u201d I asks. \u201cTell papa where it\nhurts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAw \u2014\u2014!\u201d Telescope turns from the mirror and glares at us. \u201cI\u2019m glad\nI\u2019m going to get away from you half-wits.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas the old man been kicking on yuh wasting so much time over at the\nBowers ranch, holding hands with Miss Amy, or has that tumble-bug yuh\nhad down to the corral been whispering sweet nothings in your ear?\u201d\nasks Chuck.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201cYou leave Miss Bowers\u2019 name out of it!\u201d snaps Telescope. \u201cMister Ames\nis a moving-picture man, and I may cease punching the festive cow to\nplay hero parts for him. Me and him have had quite some conversation\nregarding same, and he assures me that I\u2019ve got the physique and\nfeatures for a lead.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got the physique and features for a funeral if yuh don\u2019t quit\nwearing my red tie,\u201d says I. \u201cThat\u2019s right\u2014throw it on the floor. If\nyuh wants to make a hit with folks, why don\u2019t yuh buy some clothes of\nyour own?\u201d\n\n\u201cTell us all about it, little one,\u201d begs Muley, resting his fat chin\non his hands, and squinting at Telescope.\n\n    \u201cSing us a song of a locoed man,\n      Who got stuck on your face and shape\u2014\n    A form that was built by accident,\n      And the face of a Jungle ape.\n    Sing us a song of a keeper bold,\n      Who went sound asleep one day,\n    A keeper who\u2019s going to show up soon,\n      And lead little Archie away.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell yuh nothing!\u201d yelps Telescope. \u201cYou fellers are just plumb\nignorant.\u201d\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t it true?\u201d nods Chuck. \u201cI\u2019d take a job, too, if I was begged.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d snorts Telescope. \u201cHaw, haw, haw! Mister Ames told me that if\nhe wanted something for the public to laugh at he\u2019d sure hire you. No,\nChuckie. This is a moving picture\u2014not a sideshow.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the idea,\u201d continues Telescope. \u201cMister Ames wants something\nreal. He wants real punchers and\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNinety-eight cents in Chicago,\u201d nods Chuck. \u201cI seen in a mail-order\ncatalog where yuh could get good ones for\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants a real hold-up,\u201d states Telescope. \u201cHe wants a stage held\nup, and he don\u2019t want no fake. Sabe? Somehow he\u2019s got the idea that I\ncould do it artistic-like.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour experience will help yuh out,\u201d nods Chuck. \u201cThere was a hold-up\nover in Mexican Ca\u00f1on once, and the feller\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSufficient, Chuck!\u201d snorts Muley, and Chuck winks at me.\n\n\u201cWell, of course it wasn\u2019t done by one man,\u201d murmurs Chuck. \u201cOne of\nthe posse shot the horns off a animile and made a muley. Correct me if\nI appear to be wrong,\u201d\n\n\u201cYou stand corrected,\u201d states Muley. \u201cDesist from historical romance,\nor I\u2019ll remember one Summer afternoon down in Cottonwood, when a\ncertain man went into a bank, and \u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI accepts the correction,\u201d admits Chuck, playing a red queen on a red\nking, and Telescope continues:\n\n\u201cYou fellers keep this under your hats. Sabe? Along about Wednesday\nafternoon I\u2019m going to hold up the stage from Piperock. Of course\nafter it\u2019s over I\u2019ll return everything, and all the while this picture\nwill be taken. He wants to advertise it as a real hold-up, and she\nwill be all that.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoing south, as she drags out of Hell Gate Crossing,\u201d orates Chuck.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the designated place,\u201d grins Telescope. \u201cYou must \u2019a\u2019 been\nstudying the situation, Chuck.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuppose somebody takes a shot at yuh?\u201d I suggests. \u201cArt Miller ain\u2019t\nno suckling infant, and if there\u2019s a shipment from the Golden Cross\naboard there might be a guard.\u201d\n\n\u201cYuh never can tell about them shipments,\u201d agrees Chuck. \u201cI\u2019ve tried\nseveral times to find out.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo wonder yuh know a good place,\u201d laughs Telescope. \u201cNever mind,\nthere ain\u2019t going to be no shooting. I\u2019ll have \u2019em buffaloed. My\nshells will all be blanks. If I makes good in this I cinches a job\nwith Archibald Ames, and it\u2019s good-by to the Cross J. No more will\nMister Tolliver ride the hills and smell of burnt hair and corrals.\nPoor, eh? I\u2019ll be eating breakfast in bed while Chuck Warner is out\nchopping holes in the ice so the doggies can drink.\u201d\n\n\u201cA little more such talk and yuh won\u2019t have to be a actor to get\nbreakfast in bed,\u201d states Chuck. \u201cKeep it up, and you\u2019ll have all your\nmeals in bed. If you wants to hear me say what I think about you being\na actor you got to come outside. I got too much respect for the\nbunk-house to express myself here.\u201d\n\nThis day being Monday, we has to put up with that kind of conversation\nuntil Tuesday afternoon, when Chuck opines that he\u2019s going up to\nPiperock. Chuck can\u2019t stand prosperity, and Tuesday is payday. He\u2019s a\nroulette fiend, and he runs into bad luck every time he bucks a wheel\nin Paradise, so he wearies his bronc with monthly trips to Piperock.\nOnce he won eight dollars up there. It cost him forty but he never\nfigured that side of the ledger.\n\nAnyway we wishes him many happy returns of the day, and he lopes away.\nAs he forks his bronc he grins at Telescope, and says:\n\n\u201cTo be a good actor, yuh got to imagine you\u2019re the party you\u2019re\nimitating. Just think you\u2019re \u2018Slippery\u2019 Silverton, Telescope. He\u2019s a\ngood pattern to go by. Sabe?\u201d\n\nSlippery sure ain\u2019t no imitation. He\u2019s had the Montana officers\nbuffaloed for so long that they think he\u2019s more than one man. The\naccumulated rewards for him look like the weekly clean-up at the U. S.\nmint.\n\nMe and Muley wishes to see the proceedings, so we rides down to\nParadise the next day with Telescope, and has converse with Archibald\nAmes. He squints at the sky and shakes his head.\n\n\u201cI doubt it,\u201d says he. \u201cToo cloudy. Yuh can\u2019t get snappy stuff in\natmosphere like this, and there can\u2019t be no retake. We\u2019ll let her go\nuntil tomorrow. I may set up after a while and get some character\nstuff. Lots of local color around here. Good characters, and the\nbackground is great. Know what I mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfectly,\u201d says I. \u201cSheep-herders and so forth.\u201d\n\nTelescope opines that old man Bowers\u2019 ranch is calling him, so a\nlittle later on he rides away, he and Muley horns into a poker game,\nand about an hour later Archibald Ames invades the place and leans\nagainst the bar. Mike Pelly leaves the table to serve him, but Archie\nain\u2019t dry. He asks a question\u2014\n\n\u201cCan you tell me where I can get some raw beef?\u201d\n\nHe turns to us, and we sees the most wonderful black eye yuh ever\nseen.\n\n\u201cHoly henhawks!\u201d I snorts. \u201cWhat yuh been doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell yuh,\u201d snorts \u201cDoughgod\u201d Smith, from the doorway. \u201cHe\u2019s been\nexhibiting his danged ignorance. He opines to get a picture of a\nshepherd and he picked me!\u201d\n\n\u201cDoughgod ain\u2019t no shepherd,\u201d I explains to Archie.\n\n\u201cThis is a \u2014\u2014 of a time to tell me!\u201d wails Archie, and he goes across\nthe street to a restaurant.\n\nThe next we sees of him he\u2019s taking a picture of a rackful of broncs\nand then he goes over and photygrafts a greaser kid and a dog.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nMe and Muley donates as much as we can to Mike\u2019s game, and then quits.\nWe wanders down to Art Miller\u2019s barn, and sets down in the sun. We\nhaven\u2019t been there long, when we sees the stage drive up to the depot.\nThey dumps some stuff off, and then drives down to the barn. Beside\nArt is old man Warner\u2019s son Chuck, and when he sees us he grins all\nover his homely face. Art sees us, and they both whoops.\n\n\u201cAwful funny,\u201d says Muley. \u201cHaw, haw!\u201d\n\n\u201cAny time yuh don\u2019t think it was yuh got another think coming,\u201d whoops\nChuck, hanging on to a front wheel. \u201cHaw! Haw! Haw! Left the danged\nfool up a\u2014haw, haw, haw\u2014tree!\u201d\n\nArt leans against one of his wheelers, and the tears runs out of his\neyes.\n\n\u201cSome\u2014haw, haw, haw\u2014picture!\u201d gargles Art. \u201cI ain\u2019t laughed so much in\nmy whole life!\u201d\n\nHim and Chuck looks at each other, and busts out laughing again.\n\n\u201cWhat seems to be tickling yuh?\u201d asks Muley. \u201cIs it a secret?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, glory!\u201d gasps Chuck. \u201cListen, you fellers. That\u2019s going to be\nsome picture. Telescope held up that stage, but nobody will ever see\nthat picture. Haw! Haw! Haw! We drives out of the crossing, and he\nstops us, just like a regular bandit. Of course we know he\u2019s got\nblanks in his gun, but we elevates our hands to make the play good,\nHe\u2019s got a sack over his head, so yuh can\u2019t see his face, and I got a\nfalse mustache on so he won\u2019t know me. I made it myself.\n\n\u201cWell, we kicks the express box off, and sudden-like goes for our\nguns. He must \u2019a\u2019 been dreaming to let us get the drop thataway. We\nmakes him throw his gun in the river. Haw! Haw! Haw!\n\n\u201cThen we makes him put the box back on the stage,\u201d whoops Art. \u201cAfter\nhe gets that done we makes him walk down to the river, and get a big\nrock. Then we marches him back and makes him put it on the empty boot.\nHe made ten trips after boulders. Then we makes him dance a while,\ncrawl all the way around the outfit on his hands and knees, and to\nfinish up we made him climb up an old cottonwood snag, and he\u2019s there\nwhen we drives out of sight, with our thumbs at our noses at him. Haw!\nHaw!\u201d\n\n\u201cWait \u2019till I see Telescope,\u201d promises Chuck, weak-like.\n\n\u201cHaw!\u201d says Muley. \u201cHe\u2019d admire to hear it, Chuck. He was here until a\nwhile ago, and went over to Bowers\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere? Telescope?\u201d squeaks Chuck.\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d says I. \u201cit was too cloudy, so we postponed taking that\npicture.\u201d\n\nArt and Chuck looks foolish-like at each other and then at us.\n\n\u201cWell!\u201d says Chuck \u201cI don\u2019t sabe this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the trouble with you, Chuck,\u201d opines Muley. \u201cArt don\u2019t have\nmuch sabe either. I reckon you fellers had about ten thousand easy\ndollars crawling around your stage on its hands and knees, and just to\nshow your contempt for it yuh rode away with your thumbs at your nose\nand your fingers wiggling at it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSus-slippery Silverton!\u201d stutters Chuck. \u201cThat sure was Slippery!\nAin\u2019t we the dangdest fools on earth!\u201d\n\n\u201cBy a majority of two,\u201d agrees Muley, \u201cTelescope will be delighted.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy \u2014\u2014!\u201d gasps Art. \u201cSlippery Silverton! I think that box had a\nshipment from the Golden Cross. What a chance I took!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the way from Piperock,\u201d says I, but I don\u2019t think Chuck got it\u2014he\nwas beyond words.\n\nMe and Muley went up and had a drink, and Muley laughs so hard that he\nforgot to pay for it. We meets Art a little later on but there ain\u2019t\nmuch fun joshing him about it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on Chuck,\u201d says he. \u201cHe explains the joke to me, and as she\u2019s\npulled off as per schedule I thinks it\u2019s all right.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it spoils things for Telescope,\u201d says I. \u201cYou knowing about it\nspoils the hold-up. It might look like a fake. Sabe?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d agrees Art. \u201cTelescope is a friend of mine and\u2014I got\nit! I\u2019ll make out that I don\u2019t feel good, and I\u2019ll ask \u2018Ricky\u2019\nHenderson to drive for me. He wants to come down anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d says Muley. \u201cTelescope will make it right with you, and\nwe won\u2019t tell him about today.\u201d\n\nThat night we don\u2019t have neither Telescope or Chuck with us. Telescope\nis just riding away as we come in, and we don\u2019t have a chance to talk\nwith him, and Chuck don\u2019t come home, \u2019cause he\u2019s too danged ashamed to\nface Telescope.\n\nThe next morning the old man sends me and Muley over to the Triangle\nto get some cows that Johnny Myers brought out of the Sleeping Crick\nHills with some of his, and we misses the picture-taking. We travels\nas fast as we can, but the stage has gone past when we hits the main\nroad on our way back. There ain\u2019t nobody at the Hell Gate crossing, so\nwe pilgrims on to the ranch.\n\nAbout an hour later Telescope comes in, and a little later Chuck\ndrifts home.\n\n\u201cThere seems to be a Jonah on this job,\u201d states Telescope.\n\n\u201cWhat yuh limping about, Telescope?\u201d asks Chuck.\n\n\u201cHurt my knee. Reckon it\u2019s a good thing the stage didn\u2019t come down\ntoday, \u2019cause I\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 been a cripple in that picture. Slipped on a\nrock.\u201d\n\n\u201cStage didn\u2019t come down?\u201d I asks, and Telescope shakes his head.\n\n\u201cNope. Me and Mister Ames was there for two hours after the time, but\nshe don\u2019t show up.\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t come down?\u201d wonders Chuck, aloud. \u201cDidn\u2019t go to Paradise?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe sure didn\u2019t. Hadn\u2019t been there when I left.\u201d\n\nChuck looks foolish-like, and gets busy reading an old magazine. I\nnotices that he\u2019s got it upside down, but his lips are moving, so I\nreckon it don\u2019t matter. He\u2019s restless, and don\u2019t sleep well that\nnight.\n\nThe next morning, right after breakfast, up rides Bill McFee, our\nunworthy sheriff; Ricky Henderson, Art Miller and Al McGuire, who\nmanages the ground work of the Golden Cross. Telescope limps over to\ngreet them, and they seems a heap interested in Telescope\u2019s walk.\n\n\u201cWhat do yuh think, Ricky?\u201d asks McFee.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d hate to swear to it, Bill, but he limped.\u201d\n\n\u201cI arrests yuh in the name of the law for robbing the Piperock stage\nyesterday, Telescope,\u201d states Bill.\n\nTelescope looks foolish-like at Bill, and then laughs.\n\n\u201cYesterday, Bill? Why, it never\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe description covers yuh,\u201d states Bill. \u201cI got your pardner, who\ncalls himself Archibald Ames, in jail. He\u2019s already admitted the\nintent to rob it, but says if you robbed it he don\u2019t know nothing\nabout it. Said he was late meeting yuh, so he don\u2019t know what yuh\nmight \u2019a\u2019 done.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoever done it got seven thousand in that box,\u201d states McGuire.\n\n\u201cSeven thousand!\u201d wonders Telescope. \u201cI thought the clean-up was\nbrought down yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome folks did,\u201d grins McGuire. \u201cWe figured to double-cross some wise\nfolks.\u201d\n\nI hears a deep breath, and Chuck sets down hard on the step. Old man\nWhittaker comes out, and they has to chaw the whole thing over again.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says the old man, \u201cI don\u2019t think that Telescope done it, but\nunder the circumstances I reckon he\u2019ll have to go to jail.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt least yuh can have breakfast in bed,\u201d consoles Muley, and then he\nrecites:\n\n    \u201cA man in jail don\u2019t have no cares;\n      The flight of time don\u2019t bother him,\n    There ain\u2019t no place for him to go,\n      The passing hours lightly skim.\n    The judge may say, \u2018A year or two,\n      In places where they don\u2019t need clocks,\u2019\n    But you should care\u2014when you get loose,\n      You\u2019ve seven thousand in that box.\u201d\n\n\u201cMuley, when I get loose I\u2019m going to cut your rhymer square in two,\u201d\nproclaims Telescope, and just then the old man leads Telescope\u2019s bronc\nup, and he rides away with the posse.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe\u2019re sad. Doggone, it sure is a sad sight to see our compatriot in\nthe hands of the law. We smokes a while, and then I turns to Chuck\u2014\n\n\u201cWhere is that seven thousand, Chuck?\u201d He looks, queer-like, at me for\na moment, and shakes his head.\n\n\u201cDanged if I know, Hen.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou had it, didn\u2019t yuh?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope. Listen; I held up that stage before it got to the ford. Sabe? I\nwas going to chase Ricky away and drive it myself. Figured I\u2019d have\nsome fun with Telescope. Sabe? Well, I scared \u2014\u2014 out of Ricky. He\nain\u2019t got no nerves anyway, and\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d yelps Muley. \u201cDo you mean to set there and tell us that you\nscared Ricky so bad that he didn\u2019t know your physique from\nTelescope\u2019s? How about the limp?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t rush me!\u201d snaps Chuck. \u201cTelescope was so cocky about that\npicture stuff that I figured to have some fun. Did yuh ever walk on\nstilts? Well, I did when I was a kid. I made me a pair that just\nfilled my boots, and pulled a flour sack over my head. Limp?\n\n\u201cOf course I\u2019d limp. I danged near fell on my face when I yelled for\nhim to stop. I made him get out and walk back up the road, and told\nhim if he stopped I\u2019d perforate him. I took the box off the seat,\nwhich I figured was that shipment, and looks her over. On it in big\nletters she proclaims to be dynamite. I lays that box back on the\nseat, gets my stilt tangled in a wheel, and fell plumb off the grade.\n\n\u201cWell, the team ran away, that\u2019s all I know. I figured that Ricky\nwould stop \u2019em\u2014they wasn\u2019t running fast.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a looking box?\u201d asks Muley.\n\n\u201cWooden box with two ends and four sides. Regular dynamite box.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell described,\u201d applauds Muley. \u201cAll we got to find is a wooden box,\nwith two ends and four sides.\u201d\n\nArt Miller comes back in about an hour for some things of Telescope\u2019s,\nand we talks it over with him.\n\n\u201cMust \u2019a\u2019 been Telescope or the party what held her up that other\ntime,\u201d says he. \u201cThe feller that me and Chuck fussed around with\ndidn\u2019t have no limp.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe the exercise that you and Chuck gave him made him stiff and\nsore,\u201d I suggests, and Art grins. \u201cMaybe. Funny thing about that\nhold-up. After that feller helps himself he must \u2019a\u2019 scared that team,\n\u2019cause they runs away and scatters things all the way up to \u2018Mighty\u2019\nJones\u2019 place, where they smashes a front wheel on a stump and stops.\n\n\u201cRicky says there was a box of dynamite from the Golden Cross, the\nsame of which he holds careful in the seat. He said that he was meek\nwhen held up, \u2019cause he was afraid that feller might shoot into that\nbox. That box is a goner, and it\u2019s a wonder it didn\u2019t blow that outfit\nto thunder\u2014unless that\u2019s the treasure-box.\u201d\n\nArt pilgrims back towards town, and we all starts for the corral.\n\n\u201cWhere yuh going?\u201d asks Muley.\n\n\u201cAfter some dynamite dough,\u201d says all three of us together.\n\nWe rides up and down that road from the ford to Mighty\u2019s place, but we\ndon\u2019t find nothing. We stops at the old Soda Springs trail, which\nshows fresh tracks. By mutual consent we turns up the trail. About\nhalf a mile up the crick we discovers a camp.\n\nWe recognizes old \u201cFrenchy\u201d Timmons as the party humped over the fire,\ntossing flapjacks, so we rides up and greets him. He\u2019s got a couple of\nmoth-eaten burros nosing around his little tent. Frenchy is so crooked\nthat he\u2019s suspicious of himself. He\u2019s one of them kind of prospectors\nwhat goes around with the feeling that every man what speaks kindly to\nhim is laying to beat him out of the next strike he makes. He looks up\nthrough a decade of whiskers and grunts a greeting.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s your stock of location notices holding out, Frenchy?\u201d asks\nMuley. \u201cFor a man with only two burros you can make more \u2018discoveries\u2019\nthan any sourdough I ever seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cYah-h-h-h!\u201d gurgles Frenchy, way back in the whiskers. \u201cI find heem\nsometame, Mooley.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou dang well know yuh\u2014yuh sure have, Frenchy. Look!\u201d\n\nMuley points behind Frenchy, and there one end sticking out of the\nbrush, is a wooden box, and the word \u201cDYNAMITE\u201d fairly yelps at us in\nbig letters.\n\nFrenchy turns to see what we\u2019re looking at, and the son-of-a-gun\nreaches for his six-shooter. He was years too late. Me and Chuck have\nhim covered before he can touch his gun, and he stands there like a\nlamb, while Muley balances that box in front of him on the\nsaddle-horn.\n\n\u201cNext time yuh better find out who owns things before yuh picks \u2019em up\nfor yourself,\u201d advises Chuck. \u201cThrow that gun over in the brush!\nThat\u2019s the stuff. Now keep your mouth shut! Sabe?\u201d\n\nFrenchy didn\u2019t say a word, but we can see that he\u2019s a heap annoyed. We\nstrings out down the trail, and when we\u2019re about two hundred yards\nfrom the camp, comes a splintering noise, and the report of a big\nrifle. Me and Chuck throws our broncs off the trail and gets down. We\ncan hear Muley complaining about things, and we asks him why he feels\nso cross.\n\n\u201cDanged old pelican!\u201d he wails. \u201cThat bullet cut the corner off our\nbox!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou still got it, ain\u2019t yuh?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cUh-huh, I got her, Hen, but she almost met her Waterloo on a rock.\nReckon it loosened all the nails. Shall we go back and smoke up that\nold coot?\u201d\n\n\u201cNext Christmas,\u201d replies Chuck. \u201cThat old coot has got a Sharps\n.45-70, and the Warners don\u2019t care for that style of death. He\u2019s\ncrazy, Muley, and we\u2019d put ourselves in his class if we went back.\u201d\n\nWe lifts that box back on Muley\u2019s saddle, and went on.\n\nWe hits the road, and makes good lime for a mile or two, when we meets\nMighty Jones. He stops and we exchanges pleasantries. We comments on\nthe weather, the crops\u2014which theer ain\u2019t none\u2014and the general wear and\ntear on the human race. Muley switches the position of that box, and\nthe next second we\u2019re covered by Mighty Jones. I starts to grin, but\nwhen I sees that Mighty is in earnest I irons my face out flat again.\n\n\u201cHands up!\u201d he snaps, and Muley lets that box slip. She hits the\nground and rolls over. I glances at Mighty, and he\u2019s got the look on\nhis face of a man who has seen all there is in life, but ain\u2019t ready\nto go blind.\n\n\u201cMy \u2014\u2014!\u201d he gasps, whirls his bronc around and gallops off down the\nroad like a crazy man, holding on to his hat with one hand and fanning\nhis bronc with the other.\n\nWe watches him fade away in the dust, and puts our hands down.\n\n\u201cOf all the locoed actions on earth that\u2019s the sharp end of the\nlimit,\u201d proclaims Muley, sliding off his bronc.\n\nThat last shock was almost too much for that box, \u2019cause when Muley\nessays to lift her she sort \u2019a\u2019 opened on one end.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nMuley holds his position for a moment, straightens up and gets on his\nbronc without taking his eyes off the box. He spurs his bronc,\neasy-like, until he\u2019s a few feet away from that box, and then he\nimitates Mighty Jones.\n\nMe and Chuck puffs away on our cigarets and watches Muley depart.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll likely get scared, too, but I\u2019m taking a chance,\u201d states Chuck,\nand walks over to the box.\n\nHe sighs deep-like, and takes off his hat.\n\n\u201cHenry Peck, there must be a Supreme Being what watches over fools and\ncow-punchers. This box is full of eighty per cent. dynamite. Come and\ntake a look.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour word is as good as gold, Chuck. That stuff must have a good\ndisposition to stand all that grief. Let\u2019s go home before something\nhappens to irritate it.\u201d\n\nWe finds Muley at the ford, but he ain\u2019t got much to say. He asks\nChuck if he saw what was in that box, and Chuck said that he did.\n\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d exclaims Muley. \u201cIt stood rough handling but I never\nthought a face like yours could look upon eighty per cent. dynamite\nand not explode it. That\u2019s why I went away so rapid.\u201d\n\nThe old man is home when we gets there, and he announces that\nTelescope and Archibald Ames are still in jail.\n\n\u201cWhat does Archibald have to say about it?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cThat fat four-flusher!\u201d yelps the old man. \u201cHe says that Telescope\nmight \u2019a\u2019 done it. Of course this Ames feller don\u2019t fit the\ndescription, but he might at least\u2014aw\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going down to see Telescope,\u201d announces Muley.\n\n    \u201cHe lies down there in durance vile\n      Behind the bolts and locks,\n    With prison staring in his face\n      \u2019Cause we can\u2019t find that box.\n    That held a little bunch of gold,\n      Which was labeled dynamite.\n    Will we let our pal wear striped clothes?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot by a gol-danged sight!\u201d I finishes, being somewhat of a poet\nmyself.\n\nMuley shakes my hand and invites me to join the Perverted Order of\nParadise Poets, of which he\u2019s the only living member.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell too much down there, Muley,\u201d advises Chuck. \u201cIf you runs\noff at the mouth I might get eased into jail, and that would cut down\nthe number of detectives on the case. Sabe?\u201d\n\n\u201cFear not,\u201d says Muley. \u201cI go but to bring cheer to the needy. I will\nbe back anon.\u201d\n\nAbout three hours later Doughgod Smith rides in, and we walks out to\nwhere him and the old man are greeting each other.\n\n\u201cIf this keeps on, Whittaker, you\u2019re going to be short of men,\u201d states\nDoughgod.\n\n\u201cHuh!\u201d grunts the old man. \u201cOne man don\u2019t make no difference this time\nof year. Three punchers is enough to set around and play cards, and\neat up good grub.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou only got two left now,\u201d says Doughgod. \u201cMuley\u2019s in jail, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cMuley!\u201d snorts the old man. \u201cWhat\u2019s he in for?\u201d\n\n\u201cStealing dynamite from Mighty Jones.\u201d\n\nChuck had started to set down on his heels, but when Doughgod\u2019s\ninformation hits his ears he sprawls flat on his back and blinks at\nthe sky. I starts to lean on a buckboard wheel that is ten feet away,\nand I ends up on my back with my feet over the tongue.\n\n\u201cMighty spoke of some folks being accessory to the fact, too,\u201d states\nDoughgod, offhand-like.\n\n\u201cStealing dynamite!\u201d yelps the old man. \u201cWhere, when and what for?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Mighty comes to town and acts like a man what has had\ndelirious delight scared out of him. He anchors to Pelly\u2019s bar until\nhe\u2019s gained normal again, and then he speaks knowingly of\npowder-thieves. Mighty\u2019s half-loco, and what ain\u2019t loco is\nabsent-mindness, but just the same he has Muley arrested, and he hints\nof more arrests as soon as certain persons hit town. I seen Muley, and\nhe said if I came this way to have Chuck and Hen come to see him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d agrees the old man. \u201cWe\u2019ll all go down.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot me,\u201d says I. \u201cI got rheumatic pains in my knees. Notice how I\nfell over that buckboard handle? I ain\u2019t myself today, and I simply\ncouldn\u2019t stand it to ride.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither could I,\u201d says Chuck. \u201cI\u2019m sore all over. Let\u2019s wait until\ntomorrow. Muley will be there just the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go in the buckboard,\u201d says the old man. \u201cIn a case like this\nI\u2019d go if I had to walk.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d admire to walk,\u201d says Chuck, but the old man goes after the team,\nand me and Chuck helps each other limp to the bunk-house.\n\n\u201cShake hands with a murderer, Henry,\u201d says Chuck, offering his hand.\n\u201cI\u2019ve killed the old man and crippled Doughgod for life\u2014in my mind.\nYou and me will spend the evening and night in the Paradise jail,\nHenry Clay Peck.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t yuh think of nothing cheerful to sing?\u201d I asks. \u201cIf we\u2019re in\njail we never will find that box. Think!\u201d\n\n\u201cThink \u2014\u2014!\u201d yelps Chuck, going to the door. \u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy the\nuntainted air as long as I can.\u201d\n\nI rustles out my war-sack and puts on clean clothes. It\u2019s liable to be\nsome time before I gets a chance to change again. Chuck comes back\nafter a while and sets down on the bunk, disconsolate-like, and plays\n\u201cJust Before the Battle, Mother\u201d on his mouth-organ. Pretty soon the\nold man yells to us.\n\nWe walks out, slow-like, and I climbs, painfully, into the seat with\nthe old man. Chuck holds the team by the bits until we\u2019re all set.\nThen he lets loose and hops aboard as we goes past. We whirls out of\nthe yard and hits the road on the run. Sudden-like that equipage does\na high dive on one side, and yours truly stands on his head in a\nmesquite bush.\n\nWhen I gets through making a cactus pincushion of my cranium, I riseth\nup and looks around.\n\nDown the road about fifty yards sets the old man, gazing off down the\nroad, and cussing at a piece of line he\u2019s still got in one hand. I\nhears a groan across the road, and Chuck\u2019s head sticks up out of the\nbrush. The old man gets up out of the road and painfully dusts off the\nseat of his pants. He plods up to us and looks us over.\n\n\u201cBy cripes!\u201d he snorts, \u201cI ain\u2019t suspicious of nobody on earth. I\u2019m a\nman among men, and I don\u2019t suspicion nobody, but if that wasn\u2019t foul\nplay I\u2019ll eat the whole ranch. Now, I\u2019ll haul you hombres to town in a\nlumber wagon.\u201d\n\nHe plods on to the house, while I extracts cactus spines and cuss\nwords from my carcass. Chuck limps over and rubs his hip.\n\n\u201cLight on a rock?\u201d I asks, and he feels of his hip some more.\n\nHe reaches into his hip pocket, takes out an object and tosses it on\nthe ground.\n\n\u201cLit right on the darned thing!\u201d he groans.\n\nIt\u2019s the nut off a front wheel of that buckboard. I kicks it off into\nthe brush, and rolls a smoke.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says he, after a while, \u201cyou can give me credit for blocking\nthe wheels of progress for a minute, can\u2019t yuh? I\u2019ll likely have to\nstand up all the way to town.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get plenty of time to rest,\u201d says I.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe got to Paradise, but it wasn\u2019t no pleasure-ride, and the first\nperson we see is Mighty Jones.\n\nMighty seems to have drowned his feelings, and he\u2019s spending his\nafternoon trying to hold up the hitch-rack. The old man goes in the\nsaloon, but me and Chuck goes over to have a interview with our enemy.\nHe nods at us like an owl.\n\n\u201cTut-tut-tried to bub-blow me up,\u201d he stutters, \u201cTha\u2019s mean thing\nto-to-to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell us all about it, old-timer,\u201d says Chuck, helping the old boy let\nloose of the rack, and leading him over to the sidewalk. \u201cWhat\u2019s all\nthis dynamite stuff I\u2019m hearing about?\u201d\n\nMighty gets very deliberate in his language:\n\n\u201cEighty pershent. Tha\u2019s good powder. Sabe? Good powder but too\nener-zhetic. Know what I mean? Mine\u2019s eighty per shent. Stage runs\naway and sehtops at my place. I find box of shixty per shent. Sabe?\nEighty too dangeroush to pack, so I exchanges. Sabe. Same price.\nEighty per shent too easy on trigger. Know what I mean? Lissen;\nshomebody mus\u2019 \u2019a\u2019 stole that eighty from the stage, and I can\u2019 fin\u2019\nmine. Sabe?\u201d\n\n\u201cThink!\u201d yelps Chuck. \u201cThink where yuh put it, Mighty!\u201d\n\nMighty bobs his head and screws up his face:\n\n\u201cI know. Tha\u2019s the box Muley tried to assassinate me with.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was eighty per cent.!\u201d yells Chuck. \u201cDoyuh get that? It was\neighty per cent.!\u201d\n\n\u201cZas so? Fool to drop eighty per shent. Awful careless.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did you put that box you took off the stage?\u201d I asks,\npronouncing every word distinct and separate.\n\nMighty is so danged absent-minded that yuh got to make him remember.\n\n\u201cYou took it out of the stage, and then what did you do with it?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody must \u2019a\u2019 stole\u2014whoa! I know! In the woodshed. I thought I\nput it in the barn. Ain\u2019 that the limit? Mus\u2019 go and turn poor old\nMuley loosh. Yes, sir. He never stole nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d applauds Chuck. \u201cGo right over and tell the sheriff to\nturn him loose.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got to shee Ricky firsht,\u201d states the old pelican, wise as a barn\nowl. \u201cMus\u2019 shee if Ricky wants to hold him for stealing that eighty\nper shent. Mighty Jones is law-abiding pershon. Know what I mean?\u201d\n\nWe watches Mighty weave down the street, and Chuck grins all over his\nface\u2014\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll find Telescope\u2019s and Muley\u2019s broncs, and we\u2019ll go up to Mighty\nJones\u2019 woodshed and rescue that money.\u201d\n\nWe finds both broncs in Pelly\u2019s barn, so we saddles up and fares\nforth. We don\u2019t fare far until we meets Bill McFee. We stops and asks\nBill if there\u2019s anything new.\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d says he. \u201cI reckon we got \u2019em in jail.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d says Chuck. \u201cBill, how would you like to take a ride with us and\nbring back that seven thousand?\u201d\n\nBill grins like it was a good joke:\n\n\u201cUh-huh. I\u2019d admire that. What\u2019s the joke?\u201d\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t no joke, Sheriff,\u201d says I. \u201cYou go with us and bring the gold\nback. Is that satisfactory?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d admire to know a little more.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all necessary,\u201d says Chuck. \u201cElection is only three months\naway, and the credit ain\u2019t going to hurt yuh none, Bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s sensible,\u201d agrees Bill. \u201cI\u2019m with yuh.\u201d\n\nBill attempts to find out things, but we don\u2019t talk much, and it\u2019s\ndark when we climbs off at Mighty\u2019s place. We hikes right over to the\nwoodshed. Bill lights a match and looks inside, drops the match and\ndon\u2019t stop running for a hundred yards. Me and Chuck gallops with him\nfor a ways, sort of sympathetic-like.\n\n\u201cBobcats!\u201d whistles Bill. \u201cShed\u2019s full of \u2019em!\u201d\n\nYuh never can tell what kind of a pet a nut like Mighty is liable to\nhave, so we ain\u2019t surprised a lot.\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t afraid of no cat what ever lived,\u201d states Chuck. \u201cI\u2019m going\nto get that box in spite of anything.\u201d\n\nWe pilgrims up close again, with our guns ready. Chuck finds an old\nnewspaper, which he lights, and we peeks around the corner of the\ndoor, and looks right into the shiny eyes of two big cats. Three guns\ngoes off at the same time, and three men went away. There ain\u2019t a\nsound from the shed, so we sneaks back.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good shooting,\u201d applauds Bill. \u201cTwo shots killed \u2019em both,\n\u2019cause I shot in the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure was,\u201d I agrees, \u201cI did, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d agrees Chuck. \u201cThey must \u2019a\u2019 jumped high, \u2019cause mine\nwent through the roof.\u201d\n\nChuck tosses in that burning paper. Them cats are still there but\ndon\u2019t move.\n\n\u201cRugs!\u201d snorts Chuck. \u201cMighty is sort of a taxidermist, and he put\nthem eyes in himself. They sure look natural.\u201d\n\nWe found that box. Chuck makes a presentation speech to the minion of\nthe law, who recites a few appropriate words in return. Bill takes the\nbox on his saddle-horn, and we goes back to Paradise.\n\nWe gets McGuire and all the rest of Paradise\u2019s population to see the\ngrand opening. We assembles in Pelly\u2019s saloon and Mike furnishes the\nhammer.\n\n\u201cGents,\u201d states Bill, \u201cthis ain\u2019t a complete exoneration of Telescope\nand Ames, but I reckon it clears \u2019em a plenty. The law recovers said\nstolen property, but I\u2019ll let Mister Warner and Mister Peck tell the\nstory. I can hunt lost things but I can\u2019t tell a interesting story\nlike some folks.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou better superintend this, McGuire,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of\nwealth to look upon.\u201d\n\nHe tears the top boards off, and Paradise gazes a plenty.\n\nMe and Chuck takes one gaze, and slips loose. We meets at the door,\nambles around the corner and forks our broncs. I follers Chuck\u2019s lead,\nand about a mile from town we stops and looks back.\n\n\u201cHenry,\u201d says he, sad-like, \u201cwho do you suppose put them rocks in that\nbox?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I knew I\u2019d be a murderer,\u201d says I, and then it strikes me funny.\n\u201cBox of scab-rock guarded by two mounted bobcats! Haw! Haw! Haw!\nMister McFee, we hereby puts in your care and custody one box, the\nvalue of same being problematical. You being a duly elected officer of\nthe law, and, we having faith in your integrity and sense of duty,\nturneth over said box to be dealt with as yuh see fit,\u201d says I,\nquoting Chuck\u2019s woodshed speech.\n\n\u201cValue being problematical takes the curse of anyway, Hen,\u201d says he.\n\nIt\u2019s about midnight when we arrives at the Cross J. The old man is in\nthe bunk-house, and he looks us over, sad-like.\n\n\u201cWhat are you fellers trying to do?\u201d he asks. \u201cThe sheriff sure is one\nsore person. Says he can prove that one or both of you was mixed up in\nthat robbery.\u201d\n\n\u201cAw \u2014\u2014!\u201d snorts Chuck. \u201cI thought it was the right box.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was. McGuire identified it. The question is this: you knowed where\nthe box was\u2014where are the contents? That\u2019s what Paradise wants to\nknow.\u201d\n\n\u201cParadise ain\u2019t got nothing on us, eh, Chuck?\u201d says I. \u201cIf they wanted\nto know any worse than we do they\u2019d all be sick.\u201d\n\nMe and Chuck talks it all over and decides that the longer we\u2019re out\nof jail the more they\u2019ll have against us when we do get in, so we\ndecide to give ourself up before we\u2019re liable to capital punishment.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next morning we rides away to be locked up in self-defense. Just\noutside of Paradise we overtakes an Injun. He\u2019s jogging along on a\nglass-eyed pinto, and he grins when he sees Chuck. Chuck stands in\nwith all the aborigines.\n\n\u201cHello, Tenas Charley,\u201d grins the buck.\n\n\u201cHello, Hiawatha,\u201d grins Chuck. \u201cWhere you go so early?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sabe Doc Milliken?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou bet. Why you wantum?\u201d\n\n\u201cGivum letter. Me got letter. White man hurtum leg. No walk. Me go to\nDoc Milliken. Sabe?\u201d\n\nHe fusses around in his blanket and produces a piece of paper. Chuck\ntakes the paper and reads the few words. He hands me the letter and\ngrins. It reads like this:\n\n    Hurt my leg. Follow the Injun to me.\n\nThere ain\u2019t no name signed.\n\n\u201cHeap scared,\u201d informs the Injun. \u201cHurtum leg on tree.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere you camp?\u201d asks Chuck, and we gets informed that it\u2019s on Little\nBeaver Crick. Chuck gives him back the letter, and swings around. \u201cSo\nlong, Setting Bull,\u201d says he, and the Injun grins and bobs off down\nthe road.\n\n\u201cNow where?\u201d I asks, and Chuck grins, \u201cSlippery Silverton!\u201d he whoops.\n\u201cIf it was anybody around here they\u2019d \u2018a\u2019 signed their name. He\u2019s\nhived up with that Injun, and we\u2019re going to land him, Henry. Maybe\nhe\u2019s got the gold, too.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t take us long to find that camp. We advances on foot. There\u2019s\na white man setting on the sunny side of that teepee, and he\u2019s in\nblissful ignorance until me and Chuck lands on his shoulders like two\nplayful bears. He gets energetic, but Chuck taps him on the head with\nhis gun, and we hog-ties him proper. When he opens his eyes Chuck\ngrins at him an\u2019 says\u2014\n\n\u201cHello, Slippery.\u201d\n\nHe don\u2019t say a word.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk,\u201d advises Chuck. \u201cYuh might wear out your teeth.\u201d\n\nThe feller looks at us, foolish-like, so we hoists him up on Chuck\u2019s\nbronc, and Chuck rides behind him. Once he opened his mouth and spoke\none line:\n\n\u201cYou fellers are an hour late.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s all he said. I reckon Chuck hit him pretty hard.\n\nWe pilgrims right into Paradise, and up to Pelly\u2019s saloon. There ain\u2019t\na soul in sight, but we observes signs of life down where we holds our\ncourt. We takes our captive down there, cuts the ropes off his legs\nand takes him inside.\n\nThe place is crowded and Telescope is on the stand. We gets in just in\ntime to hear the judge ask Telescope if he can think of any earthly\nreason why he shouldn\u2019t be held for the next term of court.\n\n\u201cA lot of reason, Judge!\u201d yells Chuck, pushing our prisoner up to the\nfront. \u201cHere\u2019s the main reason. Gents, I makes yuh used to Slippery\nSilverton!\u201d\n\n\u201cSilverton \u2014\u2014!\u201d I hears McGuire yelp.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the owner of the Golden Cross mine, Mister Warde,\u201d And then he\nhorns his way over to our prisoner and snorts\u2014\u201cWhat does this all\nmean?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d says the feller. \u201cI\u2014\u2014 I must \u2019a\u2019 got hurt. Unless I\u2019m\nmistaken I came part-way from the mine with Joe Allerton. We had that\ngold shipment. We sent out two decoy boxes on account of so many\nrobberies. We rode across the hills. Joe figured on just making that\ntrain. He went to Helena. I wanted a pair of moccasins, and Joe left\nme at that Indian teepee. The owner wasn\u2019t there, so I waited. That\u2019s\nall, I guess. Somebody jumped on to me and\u2014here I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe\u2014the gold didn\u2019t come down yesterday?\u201d gasps McGuire, and Warde\nshakes his head, painful-like. \u201cNo. Just a box of rocks.\u201d\n\nJust then in comes Doc Milliken.\n\n\u201cSay!\u201d he yells. \u201cWill one of you strong men come and help me set a\nman\u2019s leg? Mighty Jones cut a tree the wrong way and it lit on him.\nLucky he was found by an Injun, who came for help. He was able to send\na note but fainted before he could sign his name. All I want is\nsomebody to hold him down. He\u2019s so absent-minded that he\u2019s liable to\nrun away. He says to tell Ricky Henderson that his box of dynamite is\neither in the hay-loft or under his cabin floor. He can\u2019t remember\nwhich.\u201d\n\nArt Miller is standing close to Chuck, and Chuck grabs him by the arm\nand whispers\u2014\u201cWhat does a new wheel for your stage cost, Art?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout eight dollars, Chuck\u2014why?\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s ten. Don\u2019t ask me.\u201d\n\nWhile there is plenty of talk me and Chuck backs out and rides out of\ntown. We\u2019re in the bunk-house when Telescope and Muley and the old man\ncomes home. Telescope and Muley comes in and looks us over,\nsolemn-like. Pretty soon Muley climbs up on the bunk and recites, with\nappropriate gestures and feeling:\n\n    \u201cLet me sing yuh a song of four danged fools,\n      Four punchers whose brains are nix,\n    Who done some things they ought not to do,\n      And got in a \u2014\u2014 of a fix.\n    One was stuck on himself and wanted to be\n      Admired at ten cents a throw.\n    Another wore stilts so he\u2019d look like a man,\n      When he went out after the dough.\n    Three of the fools fooled with dynamite,\n      One beat up an innocent man.\n    The price of a wheel was all that it cost.\n      You may beat it\u2014I don\u2019t think yuh can.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeautiful,\u201d says I. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a soul, Muley. There\u2019s still that box\nof dynamite of Mighty\u2019s to account for.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe picked it up on his way home,\u201d says Muley. \u201cThat\u2019s settled.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid Archibald Ames get his local color?\u201d I asks, and Telescope shakes\nhis head. \u201cArchibald Ames didn\u2019t wait for nothing. He even hired\nsomebody to drive him to Silver Bend. I asked him what he wanted me to\ndo, and he told me to go to a place where they don\u2019t cut holes in the\nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll miss them meals in bed,\u201d sympathizes Chuck, wiggling his ears,\nand ducks outdoors just in time.\n\nA boot-jack splintered on the door behind him.\n\n\u201cWell, it ended all right anyway,\u201d grunts Muley. \u201cHow\u2019d yuh say yuh\nhurt that leg, Telescope?\u201d\n\nTelescope peeks out of the door, and then limps back to me and Muley.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go to Bowers\u2019 that first day the stage was robbed,\u201d he\nwhispers. \u201cDon\u2019t breathe it to a soul. I wouldn\u2019t have Chuck hear it\nfor a million.\u201d\n\nWe holds up our right hands.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says he, \u201cthat cottonwood snag they made me climb didn\u2019t have\nno bark on it, and when I started down I slid too fast. Sabe?\u201d\n\n\u201cChuck was right!\u201d I snorts. \u201cHe sure told the truth that time.\u201d\n\nTelescope hops to his feet and grabs me by the arms.\n\n\u201cWhat do yuh mean, Hen? What did Chuck say?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said it sure was slippery,\u201d says I.",
