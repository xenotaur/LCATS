    "body": "The landing port at Titan had not changed much in five years.\n\nThe ship settled down on the scarred blast shield, beside the same trio\nof squat square buildings, and quickly disgorged its scanty quota\nof cargo and a lone passenger into the flexible tube that linked the\nloading hatch with the main building.\n\nAs soon as the tube was disconnected, the ship screamed off through\nthe murky atmosphere, seemingly glad to get away from Titan and head\nback to the more comfortable and settled parts of the Solar System.\n\nThe passenger, Dr. Sidney Lee, stood by the window-wall of the main\nbuilding and watched the ship disappear into the dark sky. He was tall\nand lean, seemingly all bone and tendon, with graying dark hair and\nfaintly haunted eyes set deep into a rough-hewn, weather-worn face.\nWhen the ship was nothing more than another star overhead, he turned\nand looked at the place.\n\n_Five years hasn't made any difference_, he thought. The single room\nof the main port building was unchanged: a little grimier, perhaps,\nand a little more worn. But essentially unchanged. There were the same\nturnstiles and inspection machines, the same processing and handling\ngadgets for your papers and baggage, the same (it couldn't be, but they\n_looked_ the same) two bored techs sitting at the far end of the room,\nunwilling to lift an eyebrow unless specifically commanded to do so.\n\nLee walked over to the papers processor and pushed his credentials into\nits slot. After a few wheezes and clanks its green light flickered\non and the papers fell into the \"return\" bin properly stamped and\napproved. At the same time, his lone bag slid along a conveyor belt\nand onto the pickup table.\n\nWith his credentials back inside his jacket and the bag in hand, Lee\nlooked toward the two clerks. They were studiously avoiding his eyes,\nsearching intently through some schedules that they kept on hand for\njust such emergencies.\n\n\"Sid! Hi!\"\n\nHe turned at the sound of her voice.\n\n\"I'm sorry to be late,\" she said, hurrying across the big empty room,\n\"but we never know when the Ancient Mariner is going to arrive. It's\nnot a matter of whether it'll be on schedule or not ... just a question\nof guessing how late it's going to be.\"\n\nHe smiled at her. \"Hello, Elaine. It's good to see you again.\"\n\nShe hadn't changed either, and this time he was glad of it. She was\nstill slim and young, her hair a reddish gold, her eyes gray-green. She\nwas dressed with typical casualness: comfortable boots, dark slacks and\nsweater that outlined her trim figure, and a light green scarf for a\ntouch of color. Outwardly, at least, she seemed cheerful.\n\n\"Come on,\" she said, \"I've got a buggy in the parking area. I wanted to\nget a few more of the old gang to come out and meet you, but there's\nnot many of them left, and they're all pretty busy....\" Her voice\ntrailed off.\n\n\"I didn't expect a brass band and a key to the city,\" Lee said. Then he\nadded, \"You're pretty gay for a female scientist,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm always gay when I meet old friends again.\"\n\nHe said nothing.\n\n\"I wish you'd cheer up,\" Elaine coaxed.\n\n\"I will; give me time.\"\n\n\n\nThey entered the parking building and got into a bubble-top car. Elaine\ngunned it to life, and they slid out of the near-empty parking area,\nthrough the pressure doors, and into Titan's unbreathable atmosphere.\n\n\"Have you been here straight through since I left?\" he asked.\n\n\"No. I spent about eighteen months on Venus, slushing through the\nswamps in search of ruins that couldn't possibly have survived a\ncentury in that climate.\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"That's it,\" she said, shrugging. \"Something ventured but nothing\nfound. So I asked to be returned here.\"\n\n\"It's got you, too, hasn't it?\"\n\nHer face became serious for the first time. \"Certainly it's got me.\nIt's got all of us. Do you think we'd stay out here otherwise?\"\n\n\"Anything new turned up?\"\n\nElaine shook her head. \"Nothing you haven't seen in the reports. Which\nmeans nothing, really.\"\n\nHe lapsed into silence and watched the frozen landscape slide by as\nthe car raced along Titan's only highway. They crossed a bleak, frozen\nplain, bluish-white in the dim twilight from the distant Sun. The stars\ntwinkling in the dark sky overhead made the barren scene look even\ncolder. The road climbed across a row of hills, and as they made a turn\naround the highest bluff, Saturn came into view.\n\nNo matter how many times Lee had seen the planet, it had always\nthrilled him. Now, five years later, it was still an experience.\nThree times larger than the full moon as seen from Earth, daubed\nwith brilliant yellow, red and orange stripes, and circled about its\nmiddle by the impossible-looking rings, Saturn hung fat and low on the\nhorizon, casting shadows stronger than the Sun's.\n\n\"It's a compensation, isn't it?\" Elaine said.\n\nSoon they were down on the plain again, but now it was a shattered,\nbroken expanse of jagged rock and ice. A greenish methane cloud drifted\nover the face of Saturn, and Lee finally turned his eyes away.\n\n\"You can see the towers from here,\" Elaine reminded him.\n\n\"I know,\" he said. He could not make out any detail, but there they\nwere, just as they had been for--how long? Ten thousand years? A\nhundred thousand? Five towers jutting straight up from the bleak plain,\nclustered around a central, taller tower.\n\n\"Is the machinery still running?\" he asked, pointlessly.\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"There was some talk a year or so back about trying to stop it.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"They wouldn't dare.\"\n\n\n\nThe machine had been discovered more than ten years earlier, when the\nfirst Earthmen landed on Titan. Saturn's largest satellite was devoid\nof life, a world of dark and cold, of hydrogen atmosphere and methane\nclouds, of ammonia seas and ice mountains.\n\nAnd there in the midst of it all stood the machine: a brazenly\nunconcealed cluster of mammoth buildings, with its five stately towers\nsurmounted by the soaring central sixth. And within, row upon row of\nunexplained machinery, fully automated, operating continuously in\nperfect order.\n\nAlien.\n\nThe discoverers soon concluded that the machine was unbelievably\nold, older than the Egyptian pyramids, perhaps even older than the\nMartian canals. And it was running smoothly. For untold centuries, for\nuncounted millennia, it had continued to operate efficiently, tended\nonly by automatic machines.\n\nA clear challenge to the space-rovers from Earth. Who made this\nmachine? How does it work? Why is it here? What is it doing?\n\nAs soon as its discovery was made known, the machine was visited by a\nsteady stream of Earthmen--physicists, archeologists, engineers of a\nthousand different specialties, and soldiers, politicians, men who were\nnow forced to believe the inevitable. The machine was photographed,\nx-rayed, blueprinted, analyzed spectroscopically, philosophically, even\ntheologically.\n\nWho built it? How does it work? Why is it here?\n\nNo answers.\n\nDr. Sidney Lee, an anthropologist who had made a name for himself by\nunraveling the history of the ruins on Mars, arrived on Titan full of\noptimism and enthusiasm. Twenty months later he was taken from Titan to\na psychomedical center on Earth--completely irrational and suffering\nfrom man's oldest dread: the unknown.\n\n\n\nReturning to the underground center that had grown over the years\nnear the machine, to house the living and working quarters of the\ntiny scientific community on Titan, was something like returning home\nfor Dr. Lee. Someone had seen to it that he got his old quarters back\nagain. Most of the people he had known from five years ago had gone\nelsewhere, but a few remained.\n\n\n\nLee spent his first few days renewing acquaintances and meeting the\nnew men and women. He was surprised at their youth, until he tried to\nrecall how he must have looked and acted when he first arrived on Titan.\n\n\"Makes you realize how time takes its toll, regardless of geriatrics,\"\nhe said to Dr. Kimball Bennett. Official director of the center,\nBennett had called Lee into his office for a chat.\n\n\"Come on now,\" Bennett scoffed, \"you're talking like a man of ninety.\nWhy, you won't need geriatrics for at least another month.\"\n\nThey both laughed. Bennett was a shy-looking, slender astrophysicist\nwho spoke softly, never seemed to exert himself, and yet commanded the\nunabashed admiration of every member of the center.\n\n\"All right,\" Lee said. \"You didn't call me to discuss my failing years.\nWhat's on your mind?\"\n\n\"Oh, I just thought it's about time you got to work. You've been\nloafing around for a week now. We can't afford to feed you free\nforever, you know.\"\n\n\"No, I guess you can't,\" Lee agreed, smiling.\n\nBennett leaned back in his chair and studied Lee for a long moment. \"I\nwon't ask you why you wanted to come back. But I was delighted when I\nsaw the paperwork with your name on it. Want to know why?\"\n\n\"Now I am curious.\"\n\n\"I want to leave Titan. I've been heading this operation for too\nmany years, now. I want out. And I really can't leave until I have a\ntop-notch man to run this little show. You're my replacement.\"\n\n\"As director?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Not me,\" Lee said, shaking his head. \"I couldn't.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Why? Hell, Kim, you saw them carry me out of here five years ago. How\ndo you know the same thing won't happen again? How do I know it?\"\n\nA trace of a smile flickered across Bennett's face. \"Look, the fact\nthat you returned to Titan--to this center and to that infernal machine\nout there--well, that's proof enough to me that you've licked whatever\nit was that caused your breakdown.\"\n\n\"Maybe you're satisfied,\" Lee countered, \"but how about the rest of\nthe staff? How will they feel about having a reconditioned neurotic\nheading the show?\"\n\nBennett's smile broke into an open grin. \"Self-pity is a terrible\nthing. Do you know what those kids think of you? You're Dr. Sidney Lee,\nthe foremost xeno-anthropologist of the human race. You're the man who\ndeciphered the Martian Script, who uncovered the ruins on Tau Ceti, who\ndid the definitive studies on the cave man cultures on Sirius and Vega.\nYour troubles here on Titan are just a six-month incident in the middle\nof a dazzling career. Haven't you noticed the deference with which\nthey've been treating you? You're a big man on this campus.\"\n\n\"I don't know....\"\n\n\"It won't be a lifetime job,\" Bennett coaxed. \"In a couple of years\nsome of the young squirts around here will have acquired enough poise\nand self-control to run the show. Then you can go on to something else.\"\n\nLee got up from his chair and paced slowly to the bookshelf that lined\none wall of the office. \"Why don't you stay on for another year or so,\nand then turn it over to one of the youngsters?\"\n\nBennett wordlessly extended his arms over the desk. His hands were\ntrembling, almost imperceptibly, but trembling.\n\nLee stared at the hands. \"You too?\"\n\nBennett placed his hands palms down on the desk. \"Do you think you're\nthe only one who worries about an alien race who can build a machine\nthat we can't understand after ten years of investigation and study?\"\n\n\n\nThe official transfer took place the following day, shortly after\nbreakfast. Bennett called a meeting of the six department heads and\nannounced that he would leave Titan on the next ship. It came as no\nsurprise.\n\n\"From here on, I'm just an interested observer,\" he said. \"Dr. Lee is\nin charge.\" He paused for a moment, then went on, \"I thought this would\nbe a good time to review what's been going on most recently, and where\nwe stand.\"\n\nLee took an old pipe out of his jacket pocket and filled it while he\nwatched them try to decide who would talk first. The six department\nheads all looked young and eager, he thought. Elaine was among them, of\ncourse, as head of the archeology group.\n\nAfter a bit of finger-pointing and head-shaking, Dr. Richards took\nthe floor. Head of the physics section, he had one of those open,\nclear-eyed, crew-cut faces that would look young even after his hair\nturned gray.\n\n\"It just so happens,\" he began, \"that we finished a study yesterday\nthat may be of some slight significance.\" From the size of his grin,\nLee judged that the physicist was making a weak attempt to underplay\nhis speech.\n\nRichards walked to the viewscreen at the far end of the room and turned\na dial. The screen flickered for a moment, then showed a chart.\n\n\"You remember from our last meeting,\" he said, \"that our group finally\nsucceeded in reaching the generating unit that powers all the machinery\nout there. Uh, Dr. Lee, this is something we've been working on for\nmore than a year. The power unit is buried in the sublevel of the main\nbuilding out there, and it's damned difficult to get to it without\ntearing out other machines. We finally wormed a man down there about a\nmonth ago.\"\n\n\n\nRichards turned back to the rest of the group. \"This chart shows what\nwe've been able to learn about the power unit. Which isn't much.\nThere's no input to it. No batteries, no solar cells, nothing. There's\na fuel tank--at least, we think it's a fuel tank--that's sunk inside a\ncryogenic magnetic coil.\"\n\nElaine spoke up. \"You told us that last time. Have you been able to get\ninto the tank?\"\n\nRichards shook his head. \"Not unless we break up the coil, which we\ndon't dare try. It would probably mean destroying the power unit and\nstopping all the machinery. And we can't do _that_ until we're certain\nof what the machinery's doing.\"\n\n\"We all know that,\" said Dr. Kulaki, a wiry Polynesian who headed the\nelectronics group.\n\n\"Yes. Well, we did make a very elegant experiment,\" Richards continued,\n\"a variation of Cavendish's experiment to obtain the gravitational\nconstant, in the Eighteenth Century....\"\n\n\"Spare the history,\" Dr. Kurtzman said, half-smiling.\n\n\"Okay, okay,\" Richards said. \"We determined the mass of the fuel tank,\nand therefore of the fuel in it. The tank contains a degenerate gas....\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"A degenerate gas,\" Richards repeated. \"The stuff must weigh several\ntons per spoonful.\"\n\nDr. Petchkovich, the astronomer, frowned puzzledly. \"Wait a minute.\nDegenerate gases are found only in the cores of certain types of\nstars ... are you saying that this magnetic field they've put around\nthe fuel tank is strong enough to create a pressure similar to the\nweight of a star?\"\n\n\"Take a look at the chart,\" Richards said, pointing to the viewscreen.\n\"If you know of any other type of substance with a density like that,\nI'll eat it.\"\n\nThere was a brief conversation, then Dr. Bennett said, \"All right, Pat.\nIs that all?\"\n\n\"Hell no,\" Richards said, his cat-like grin returning. \"There's more.\"\n\nHe tapped a button on the viewscreen control panel, and another chart\ncame up on the screen.\n\n\n\n\"We know the power output of the generator. That was simply obtained,\nsince the one unit powers all the machinery in the buildings out there.\nSo we calculated all the known methods for obtaining power from a\ndegenerate gas, and checked them against the amount of fuel the system\nhas used up so far....\"\n\nLee interrupted. \"How do you know how much fuel has been used if you\ncan't get into the tank?\"\n\nRichards' grin broadened. \"Oh, that's easy, Dr. Lee. We know how much a\ndegenerate gas should weigh, per unit volume. We know the size of the\ntank, and therefore how much it can hold, when full. So we can estimate\nhow full the tank is simply by measuring its mass and comparing it to\nthe mass it would have if it were full.\"\n\n\"Doesn't the chemical composition of the gas have any effect on the\nmass? Wouldn't uranium be heavier than hydrogen?\"\n\n\"Yes, but not much. A factor of a hundred. You'll see in a minute that\nit's not enough to matter at this stage of the game.\"\n\nLee nodded and the physicist went on. \"Well, anyway, you can check\nout our math in the report we'll issue later this month. But it turns\nout that the only possible energy source for this gadget is total\nannihilation of the gas particles into energy.\"\n\n\"Total annihilation? How?\"\n\n\"That's a good question. I don't think we'll be able to answer it until\nwe can start taking the damned machine apart.\" He flicked a new graph\non the screen. \"But, we can calculate how long the thing has been\nrunning, on the basis of the fuel it's used up, and the energy rates\nwe've assumed....\"\n\nA slow wave of astonishment crept through the small room as, one by\none, they grasped the significance of the curving lines on the graph.\n\n\"That's right,\" Richards said. \"Unless our rough calculations are\ncompletely off the beam, which I doubt, the damned thing has been\noperating continuously for something like ten-to-the-fifth or\nten-to-the-sixth Earth years.\"\n\nA hundred thousand to a million years.\n\nThe rest of the meeting was quiet and orderly. They were all subdued\nby Richards' report. _It's been running continuously for a million\nyears_, Lee kept thinking. _A million years._\n\nHe listened automatically as the other department heads made their\nreports.\n\nRay Kurtzman was first. His report was actually a combined discussion\nof the work that his engineering group, and Dr. Kulaki's electronics\npeople, had been jointly undertaking. They had tried to determine\n(for the _n_th time) just what sort of power was being beamed by the\nantennas atop the machine's towers. No luck. The machinery was using\npower, the antennas were broadcasting _something_, but whatever it was\ncould not be detected by any instrument the Kurtzman and Kulaki had\napplied to the problem.\n\nElaine gave a routine report on the latest digging expeditions that had\nbeen sent out. No artifacts, no foundations, no remains of any sort.\nBlank.\n\nDr. Childe, a short, sharp-voiced mathematician, gave his report on his\ndepartment's analysis of the wave patterns that were being sent out by\nthe antennas. The patterns had been deduced from the fluctuations in\nenergy consumption by the antenna equipment. Childe reported another\nblank. The patterns were completely random.\n\n\"It's foolish to call them patterns at all,\" Childe complained. \"They\nlook more like the ramblings of an idiot than anything produced by\nintelligence.\"\n\n\n\nFinally, Petchkovich reported on the latest astronomical studies. The\nantennas were tracking an empty section of space between the Sun and\nthe planet Mercury. Careful observations had shown no noticeable effect\nin the widespread area where the antennas were focused.\n\n\"It is my belief,\" he concluded, \"that the antennas were originally\nfocused on one of the planets, but have since become disoriented in\nsome way, and are now well off-target.\"\n\nKurtzman huffed. \"Not very likely. If they--whoever they are--could\nmake this whole damned set of buildings full of machinery to operate\ncontinuously for a million years, do you think they'd slip up on where\nthe antennas are pointing?\"\n\n\"If it's a million years we're talking about,\" Petchkovich answered\nslowly, \"then the chances for errors are simply that much greater.\"\n\nLee decided it was time for him to step in. \"Have there been any other\nattempts to date the buildings or the machines? Radioactive decay\nrates, or something like that?\"\n\nElaine nodded. \"It's been tried at least once or twice a year, every\nyear. Nothing conclusive has ever been established. The buildings are\nobviously very old ... but million years....\"\n\nThey all lapsed into silence.\n\nLee took a deep breath and began once more. \"This million-year-business\nthrows a new light on the whole subject. Up to now, I think, we've all\nbeen looking at this machine on a day-to-day basis. I mean, we've been\nexamining what it's doing _now_. It might be worth our while to sit\nback a little and try to extrapolate the behavior we've observed back\nover a million years.\"\n\n\"Could you be a bit more explicit?\" Richards asked.\n\n\"I'll try. It's mostly a matter of viewpoint, I think. Let's start\nlooking at this machine as something that's been in operation for a\nmillion years. Let's admit to ourselves that what we see today is only\na very small slice of the whole picture. Dr. Petchkovich, you're an\nastronomer; you're accustomed to studying a star for a few months and\ncoming up with a story that covers perhaps billions of years. Right?\"\n\n\"Yes, but this is entirely different....\"\n\n\"I know. I know,\" Lee said. \"But the line of attack isn't so different.\nFor instance: Dr. Childe, suppose you send your wave patterns to the\nOrbital Computation Center at Earth and have the Big Brain work them\nover. Do you think it might come up with something useful?\"\n\nChilde shrugged elaborately. \"Maybe. If we try to extrapolate the\nsample patterns we have now over a million years, maybe something will\nshow up.\"\n\n\"It'll take months to get the Big Brain's time,\" Elaine said. \"They're\nwaiting in line all the way back to Mars for it.\"\n\n\"What are months compared to the time we've already spent?\" Bennett\ncountered.\n\n\"Or to a million years?\" Lee added.\n\nKulaki suddenly started to bob up and down in his chair. \"Say, we might\nbe on the track of something here,\" he said. \"If those circuits have\nbeen in continuous operation for a million years ... we could learn an\nawful lot about reliability....\"\n\nLee nodded in agreement. \"We have a lot to learn, that's true enough.\"\nHe cleared his throat nervously. \"There's one more thing, I am about\nto publish a paper ... it's a sort of a general paper, but it has some\nbearing on the work going on here. I wonder if you'd be good enough to\nbe a tryout audience for me?\"\n\nThey sat back to listen.\n\n\n\nLee gave only the basic outline of his paper. He discussed his findings\namong the ruins on Mars and on the lone planet circling the star Tau\nCeti; and he drew some conclusions from his investigations of the\nprimitive human cultures found on the planetary systems of Sirius and\nVega.\n\nFirst, both Sirius and Vega have both been long known to be\ncomparatively young stars. Astrophysical evidence compiled from the\nTwentieth Century onward, and finally geophysical data from the planets\nthemselves, showed that Sirius and Vega--and their planets--were\nconsiderably less than a billion years old. By contrast, the Solar\nSystem was known to be at least five billion years old.\n\nNow, the development of life takes time. It took close to three billion\nyears for life to make its first appearance on Earth. Another two\nbillion years of evolution were necessary before man arose.\n\n\"If the planets circling Sirius and Vega are less than one billion\nyears old,\" Lee stated, \"then the human populations of those\nplanets--no matter how primitive they are--_could not have originated\nthere_. They must have come from another planetary system. The closest\nsystem that could have born life on its own is our Solar System.\"\n\nSecond, the ruins on Tau Ceti and on Mars were both definitely built\nby human beings. The plans of the buildings, their furnishings and\nutensils, the scant writings and pictures that survived--all were of\nhuman origin.\n\n\"Although dating the time of destruction of these buildings is very\ndifficult,\" Lee went on, \"we can definitely say two things: they were\ndestroyed suddenly in some immense cataclysm; and they were destroyed\nat very nearly the same time, both on Mars and Tau Ceti. I hadn't\nrealized the correlation until this morning, but the destruction might\neasily be dated at approximately one million years ago.\"\n\nThere was a stir of reaction at the mention of the time period.\n\nAlso, Lee told them, he had been able to partially translate one of the\nfolk tales of the Vegan people.\n\n\"Stripped of its nonessentials, it tells of a cataclysmic war between\nthe ancestors of the Vegan people and another race, mentioned only as\nthe Others.\"\n\nHe paused and looked at them, sitting around the table. They seemed\nengrossed.\n\n\"The Vegan folk tales relate that the Others won an overwhelming\nvictory, and smashed forever their Golden Age, when they travelled\nthrough the skies and lived in unbelievable splendor.\n\n\"I'd like to make one final point. The Vegan and Sirian peoples are\nhardly human, by our standards. In addition to slight physiological\ndifferences, they live in caves and eat shellfish and giant insects.\nThey do not hunt meat-bearing animals, simply because there are not\nyet any meat-bearing animals on their planets. The humans on those\nplanets did not evolve there; they are a billion years ahead of the\nnatural evolution of their worlds.\"\n\nBennett spoke up. \"In other words, they were originally a colony from\nEarth.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"That's a lot to swallow in one sitting,\" Patrick said, quietly.\n\n\"I know,\" Lee answered. \"But it fits in with what we've found here.\nElaine, I'm certain that if you knew where to look, you could find on\nEarth the remains of a human civilization that is more than a million\nyears old....\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"That's contrary to every known scrap of evidence\nabout early man. Besides, a million years of weathering would wipe out\nalmost anything on Earth. Wind, rain, Ice Ages, earthquakes ... it\nwould be impossible.\"\n\n\"What about the Moon?\" Petchkovich asked. \"There should be some\narcheological evidence on the Moon that hasn't been completely\ndestroyed. Maybe buried under the dust or lava flows....\"\n\n\"At any rate,\" Lee said, \"I'm convinced that there was a human culture\na million years ago; that it expanded out through the Solar System and\nto the stars; that it met an implacably hostile alien race; and that\nthe humans were utterly defeated. Nearly wiped out.\"\n\n\"And the machine out there?\"\n\n\"It was built by the Others. It's alien. And hostile,\" Lee said.\n\"That's why we must find out what it's doing, and how.\"\n\n\n\nYou could feel the change in attitude throughout the center after that\nconference. An invisible, but almost palpable wave of tension swept\nthrough every office, every lab, every section of the underground\ncommunity. Not everyone believed Lee's theory about the Others.\nBut they could never look at those strange buildings again without\nwondering. What had been a puzzling, frustrating riddle took on the\nattributes of a living, intelligent enemy; an enemy that mocked their\nefforts to understand, to control; an enemy that seemed in every way\nsuperior to the feeble powers of the men from Earth.\n\n\n\nA few days after that conference, Dr. Bennett left Titan for good. Lee\nwas in full command now.\n\nHe was just finishing a quick lunch at the robocafeteria when Elaine\nwalked by and stopped at his table.\n\n\"Hi boss. I'm on my way out to the buildings. Want to come along?\"\n\nLee punched a button at the end of the table, and the dishes slid into\na wall receptacle. \"No thanks,\" he said. \"I've got some paperwork to\ndo....\"\n\n\"Sid, you're going to have to come out and face it sooner or later. Why\ndon't you come now? There's practically nobody there.\"\n\nHe looked up at her. \"You're not a part-time psychotech, are you?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, grinning. \"But I wouldn't want anybody to start\nthinking that you're afraid to go into the buildings. And I especially\ndon't want _you_ to think that.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" he said, getting up from his chair. \"You're right ... as usual.\"\n\nThey took a lift chute to the surface bubble, a dome of clear\nplastisteel that housed ground vehicles and miscellaneous outdoor\nequipment. There they squirmed into pressure suits, complete with\nfishbowl helmets. After checking out their oxygen tanks, heaters and\nradios, they were ready to go outside.\n\n\"Want to walk?\" Elaine asked.\n\nLee nodded.\n\nIt took him a few minutes to get accustomed to the low-gravity shuffle\nthat you must employ to walk on Titan, with its one-third Earth gravity.\n\nThey headed for the buildings, under the double shadows cast by the\ndistant Sun and the ever-present, overpowering Saturn. The buildings\nloomed straight up from the dark plain, gaunt gloomy specters from a\nbygone age haunting this shadow world. There were five low, square\nfeatureless structures ringed around a central pentagonally-shaped\ntower that swept upward to a series of spires and antennas. Several\ndoors had been cut into the outer buildings' walls by the inquiring\nEarthmen. Originally, the walls had been perfectly blank.\n\n\"Did you bring a torch?\" Lee asked.\n\nElaine shook her head. \"Don't need one anymore. We installed lights\ninside. They're tripped by a photocell as we cross through a doorway.\"\n\nHe could feel it coming on as they approached the buildings--the\ntenseness, the prickling along the spine, as if a deeply-buried memory\nwas writhing within his mind.\n\nEven before they entered the doorway he could sense the throbbing,\nbeating _purposefulness_ of the machines.\n\nAnd then they were inside, surrounded by them, row on row, tier on\ntier, inhuman untiring infallible machines humming, growling, whining,\nfilling the vast building with the rumbling power of their work.\nDriving, constantly driving at their unknown tasks. Along catwalks\nthat snaked through the maze of machines, automatic maintenance\nvehicles scurried along, stopping here for a quick adjustment, there\nfor replacement of a faulty part.\n\nNo matter where the two invading humans went along the twining\ncatwalks, the maintenance vehicles avoided them. If they stopped before\na machine that was to be serviced, the maintenance vehicle would hover\nnearby, glowering at them, waiting for them to get out of the way.\n\n\n\nHe could feel it again--the alienness, the lurking presence of an\nintelligence that scorned the intruders from Earth. Every nerve in his\nbody screamed the same message: get out, get away, this thing is evil,\nhostile, a weapon against all mankind. In the conference room, telling\nthem of his theory, he had inwardly wondered how much of it he himself\nreally believed. But here, in the midst of these implacably efficient\nmachines--he _knew_. This is the product of a cosmic hatred, the work\nof those who seek to destroy man, our ancient enemy, the unknown, the\nnameless Others.\n\n\"Are you all right?\"\n\nElaine's voice in his earphones snapped him back to reality.\n\n\"Why, do I look green?\"\n\nShe came up close enough so that their helmets nearly touched. \"A\nlittle green,\" she said, smiling. \"It gives me the creeps, too. Want to\ngo?\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered. \"Let's see the work that's going on.\"\n\nHe took a firm grip on himself and went through it all, from the\ncombined crews of archeologists and engineers tracing wiring circuits,\nto the handful of physicists conducting further tests on the power\ngenerator buried deep in the central building's foundation.\n\n\"It goes awfully slowly,\" Elaine said as they trudged back to the\ncenter.\n\n\"We're on the outside looking in,\" Lee said. \"If we could only\ndetermine the _purpose_ of the machinery, then the rest of it would\ncome pretty easily.\"\n\nThey returned to the surface bubble and took off their pressure suits.\n\n\"Nearly dinner time,\" Elaine said, as they descended to the living\narea. \"How about eating in my quarters?\" she asked.\n\n\"Can you cook?\"\n\n\"You'll find out.\"\n\n\n\nA few hours later, he had decided that she definitely could cook, and\nthat she had somehow managed to bring to Titan some of the best wine he\nhad tasted in years.\n\nNow the table was folded back into the wall, and they were sitting\ntogether on the couch, listening to music tapes.\n\n\"What's that?\" he asked.\n\n\"Villa-Lobos, a Twentieth Century composer. _Bachianas Brazilieris._\nNumber eight, I think....\"\n\nThey listened in silence for a few moments to the moody, restless music.\n\n\"Reminds me of topside, standing at the shore of the ammonia sea when a\nstorm is coming up,\" he said.\n\nElaine nodded. \"Yes ... the wind, and the dark, and the waves....\"\n\nAbruptly, the music snapped off.\n\n\"Oh damn!\" Elaine blurted. \"I thought I had the thing fixed.\"\n\n\"Let me take a look at it,\" Lee said getting up from the couch.\n\nHe tinkered with the recorder for a while, to no avail. \"I'm no\nelectronics tech, that's for sure.\"\n\nElaine shrugged. \"Don't worry about it. I'll have it repaired tomorrow.\"\n\nShe went into the kitchenette and called back, \"How about some brandy?\"\n\n\"Fine,\" he answered.\n\nShe returned and handed him a glass.\n\n\"Ad astra,\" he said, as they touched glasses.\n\n\"Amen.\"\n\nElaine walked slowly away from him, swishing the liquor in her glass.\n\"Let's go topside and see the stars,\" she said, suddenly.\n\n\"H'mm?\"\n\n\"Up to the bubble. Come on.\"\n\n\n\nSo they left her one-room quarters and took the lift tube up to the\nbubble. It was deserted. Overhead, Saturn was low on the horizon,\nsilhouetting the alien buildings. They turned to the other side of\nthe sky, where it was clear and dark. Thousands of stars twinkled in\nthe darkness; they made out Sirius and Vega, then Mars, and finally\nEarth--a bright blue jewel that outshone all the others.\n\n\"I guess Jupiter's on the other side of the Sun,\" Lee said.\n\nElaine nodded. \"It looks so far away,\" she said, staring at Earth, \"and\nso lonely, out there in all that emptiness.\"\n\n\"A psychotech would call that 'projection.'\"\n\n\"I know. We're the lonely ones, aren't we?\"\n\nShe was perfectly serious now.\n\n\"You know that Ruth and I have split up,\" he said.\n\n\"I heard ... that she left you.\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"That's a matter of viewpoint. She got tired sitting\nEarthside while I batted around the Solar System. When I told her I was\ngoing to Vega, she called it quits.\"\n\n\"Couldn't she have gone with you?\"\n\n\"If she had wanted to....\"\n\n\"Do you still love her?\" Elaine asked.\n\n\"I don't know. I don't think I know what love really is, anymore. All I\nknow is ... on that long trip out to Vega, when I had nothing to do but\nsit and think, it wasn't Ruth I was thinking about. It was you.\"\n\n\"Oh....\"\n\nThey talked a bit more, and finally he took her in his arms and kissed\nher and she was his, at least for a little while.\n\n\n\nWeeks lapsed into months, and the work on Titan inched steadily along.\nIf he stopped to think about it, Lee knew that all they were doing was\nscratching around the base of the problem, and making precious little\nheadway. _The blind men and the elephant_, he told himself. But then\nhe asked himself what else they could possibly do, and the answer was\nalways, nothing. But the machine was still there, doing whatever it\nwas designed to do, and he could sense the scornful laughter of its\ncreators as he vainly tried to understand their work. Only the thought\nof Elaine, the sight of her, the touch of her, allowed him to keep his\nsense of balance.\n\nPeople left Titan, baffled and confused; new people arrived--eager,\nfull of energy, excited at the chance to tackle the unknown,\nundimmed--at first--by the day-to-day frustrations of trying to unlock\na door that has no key.\n\n\n\nLee dialed his selection at the robocafeteria and waited a few moments\nfor the tray of food to appear at the pickup table. He had spent the\nmorning shut away in his office, searching months worth of reports for\nsome glimmer of encouragement. There was progress, of course; there was\nalways progress. But it was never in a direction that would take them\ncloser to the final answer.\n\nAnd, carefully tucked into the top drawer of his desk was a nasty\nyellow sheet that bore a querulous message from Earth: What is the\nstatus of the project? Why are expenditures constantly climbing? Is a\nninety-three-man staff really needed? When can some solid results be\nexpected?\n\nLee picked an unoccupied table and sat down. As he started to eat, a\nquartet of young engineers, headed by Dr. Kurtzman, came in and sat at\nthe next table.\n\n\"I still don't see why they keep digging,\" one of them was saying.\n\"They'll never find anything outside the buildings.\"\n\nAnother countered, \"Look, they've got to follow every possible angle.\nThe only way we're ever going to understand this thing is to put\ntogether every scrap of evidence we can find until there's enough to\nform an understandable picture.\"\n\nKurtzman shook his head. \"Not at all. This isn't going to be solved\nby putting pieces together, like a puzzle. There's more evidence in\nthose buildings than we can ever hope to digest. It's not a matter\nof adding up clues ... this is going to be a _gestalt_. One of these\ndays, somebody's going to get a few thousand million of his brain cells\nturned the right way, and he'll say, \"Ah-HAH!\" Then we'll have\nit. Until then, it's our job to keep poking around, hoping to find the\nright piece of information to trigger the _gestalt_.\"\n\nThe first one spluttered. \"But that ... that's non-scientific!\"\n\n\"So?\" Kurtzman asked, arching his eyebrows. \"Do you see science making\nany great strides around here? We're in over our heads. Intuition is\nthe only thing that can save us.\"\n\n\"If we're that bad off, we might as well quit,\" the first one said. \"In\nfact, that might be the best idea of all. Forget it and go home. Let\nthe damned machine run for another million years, if it wants to.\"\n\nLee could not keep quiet any longer. \"That would be fine, wouldn't\nit?\" he said, turning on the surprised engineer. \"Give it up and forget\nabout it, without knowing where it came from, or what it's doing, or\nwhy.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean....\"\n\n\"Listen to me. It's not just that the thing could be a weapon. It may\nnot be. But we don't know. And as long as we don't know, we've got to\nkeep trying to find out. Understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, but....\"\n\n\"And there's more at stake here than just an intellectual puzzle,\"\nLee insisted. \"If we turn our backs on this machine, we've turned our\nbacks on a basic premise of all scientific thought. If we admit that we\ncan't understand this machine, then we admit that there's an absolute\nlimit to our ability to understand the universe. We give in to the old\nwitch-doctor's claim that there are some things in the world that man\nmust not tamper with. Taboo!\n\n\"The basic nature of man and science is at stake here! We've got to\nunderstand that machine. Our claim to the stars is tied up in it.\"\n\nLee looked up and saw that everyone in the dining hall was watching\nhim. He stood up.\n\n\"Sorry; I didn't mean to get so vehement,\" he mumbled to the engineer.\n\"Guess I'm a bit edgy today.\"\n\nHe walked quickly out of the dining area and returned to his office.\n\n\n\nSlowly, quietly, the work went on. Dr. Petchkovich spent six weeks on\nMercury, supervising at first hand the investigation of the area where\nthe machine's antennas were focused. He returned to Titan in high\nexcitement.\n\n\"We have definitely proved that there is a disturbance in the\ninterplanetary magnetic field at the focal point of the machine's\nantennas,\" he announced to the department heads, when they convened in\nthe conference room to hear his report.\n\n\"How strong a disturbance?\" Dr. Kulaki asked.\n\nPetchkovich hesitated a moment. \"Well, it's only one part in a hundred\nthousand....\"\n\nThe excitement died quickly. It was a discovery, yes. But it did not\nbring them any closer to understanding the machine and its purpose.\n\n\n\nLee was sitting at his desk, staring moodily at a graph that Dr. Childe\nhad left with him: the results of the Orbital Computing Center's\nextrapolation of the wave patterns broadcast by the machine.\n\nThe phone buzzer sounded. Without taking his eyes from the graph, Lee\nflicked the phone on.\n\n\"Are you busy right now?\"\n\nHe looked up and saw Elaine's face on the screen. \"No, not really,\" he\nanswered. \"Come on in.\"\n\n\"I'll be there in a few minutes.\"\n\nAs soon as she came through the door he knew that something was wrong.\nShe was trying too hard not to look concerned.\n\n\"What's up?\" he asked her.\n\nShe shrugged and sat down in front of the desk. \"I just thought we\nmight talk for a while.\"\n\n\"In my office?\"\n\n\"It concerns official business.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nShe looked at the graph. \"What's that? Something new?\"\n\n_Changing the subject_, he thought to himself. _What's she afraid of?_\n\nAloud, he answered, \"It's Childe's results from the Big Brain ... the\nmachine's wave patterns extrapolated over a million years.\" He turned\nthe graph around so she could see it better.\n\nElaine studied it for a moment, then shook her head. \"Childe was right,\nwasn't he? It doesn't make any sense at all. No pattern, no rhyme, no\nreason.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Lee said. \"There's something ... well, something\nstrange about these waves. They don't follow a regular pattern, and\nyet....\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nHe frowned. \"They're just too damned irregular to be really random.\nThat doesn't make much sense, does it? Well, anyway, I've got the\nfeeling that I've seen this pattern--or lack of pattern--before.\nSomewhere I've seen something that looks a lot like this ... but I\ncan't remember where.\"\n\nElaine looked at the graph again, at the multiple curves swinging back\nand forth across the paper, intertwining in seeming confusion. \"It\nlooks like some of the graphs I drew when I was an undergrad.\"\n\nHe laughed. \"Maybe that's where I saw it.\"\n\nThere was an awkward silence. Lee got up from his seat and walked\naround the desk. He pulled up another chair and sat beside Elaine.\n\"Now, what's the trouble?\"\n\n\"I've been thinking,\" she said slowly. \"I ... I've decided to transfer\noff Titan.\"\n\n\"Leave? But why?\"\n\n\"For us, Sid. For both of us. Before we get so wrapped up in each other\nthat we won't be able to break it up without really getting hurt....\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" he said.\n\nShe spoke calmly and softly, no tears, no hysterics. She had thought it\nall out very carefully. \"Sid, take a look around you. We're like two\ncastaways on a desert world. We love each other--here and now. But we\nwon't always be here. What happens when we leave Titan? What happens\nwhen we're not faced with the loneliness and that ... that _thing_ out\nthere? Suppose we find that we don't really need each other? What then?\"\n\n\"But I do need you, Elaine. I love you.\"\n\n\"You do now,\" she answered. \"But how long will it last? Sid, I have to\nget away, at least for a little while. I need a sense of perspective.\"\n\n\"I see,\" he said, shifting his gaze away from her. \"That doesn't leave\nme much to say, does it? All right, Elaine. Make out a transfer request\nand I'll sign it.\"\n\n\"Thanks. I ... I hope you understand.\" She got up and started slowly\ntoward the door.\n\n\"I'm not so sure that you understand this yourself,\" he replied. \"But I\nknow this--I don't want to lose you, Elaine. If you haven't worked this\nout within a month or so after you leave Titan, I'll come looking for\nyou.\"\n\nShe turned and, without a word, went over and kissed him. Then she\nquickly left the office.\n\nLee returned to his desk. He sat down and stared at Childe's graph\nagain. After a few minutes, he angrily slapped it in a drawer, slammed\nthe thing shut, and stamped out of the room.\n\n\n\nPersonal matters were soon buried in the excitement of another\ndiscovery, this time an important one. It looked promising.\n\nKurtzman and Kulaki finally discovered what form of energy the antennas\nwere beaming out.\n\nAfter years of trial-and-error experimentation, the engineer and\nelectronicist asked Richards and Childe to lend a hand. With a firm\ntheoretical and mathematical background to bolster their work, Kurtzman\nand Kulaki started out on a process of elimination.\n\nThey soon proved that the antennas were not broadcasting any known\nform of electromagnetic energy, from gamma to long-radio waves. They\ninvestigated one possibility after another, turning up a steady\nsuccession of negative answers. Negative, but answers all the same. It\nwas time-consuming, but at least they were definitely determining which\navenues were blind alleys.\n\nThen Childe started tinkering with a hunch, and showed his paperwork\nto Richards. The two of them made a few suggestions to Kurtzman and\nKulaki. Their problem was that their detection instruments were drawing\nblanks, when applied to the antennas' output. But the power input to\nthe antennas showed they were working continuously.\n\nChilde showed, mathematically, that their output must be an extremely\nweak, low-frequency form of energy. Richards agreed, and pointed out\nthat there was only one known form of energy that fulfilled these\nconditions: gravity.\n\n\"Gravity waves?\" Kurtzman asked, incredulously, when they told him\nabout it.\n\nKulaki's mind reacted faster. \"Knowing it's gravity waves, on paper,\nand proving it experimentally are two different things.\"\n\nBut they were up to the test. They had to scavenge equipment from the\ncenter's grav screen machinery, and the whole underground community\nwas without its Earth-normal grav field for two and a half days, but\nwhen the field was returned to normal (and people stopped hopping and\nbouncing all through the center) Kurtzman and Kulaki had proved that\nthe antennas were indeed beaming out gravity waves.\n\n_It's all here_, Lee thought, as he read their combined report. _Now\nwe know what the machine is doing. But to what purpose? What influence\ndoes this have on Earth?_\n\nThen he put down the report and turned to another bit of paperwork that\nlay on his desk: Elaine's official request for a transfer. He looked\nthrough it automatically. There was a place marked _Justification for\nRequest_. Elaine had typed simply, \"Personal.\" Lee flipped to the last\npage and signed.\n\nHe leaned back in his chair and tried to let his mind float free;\nforget about her, forget about the buildings out there, forget about\neverything ... at least for a few moments. Just drift and let your mind\nwander where it pleases....\n\n\n\nThe automatic secretary on his desk hummed into life and announced,\n\"Department heads' meeting starts in five minutes.\"\n\nTo hell with the department heads. To hell with Titan. A world of cold\nand dark and ice. Like Dante's Inferno. Titan is hell. A place where\nsinning scientists are sent. Their punishment is to stand out in the\ncold and try to solve the unanswerable. Forever. Stand in the icy\ndarkness and try to understand the unknown. Once in a while you make\na discovery that excites you; but when you look again, your discovery\nis meaningless, you know as little about the real answer as you knew\nbefore. The discoveries are just part of the punishment, part of the\neternal torment, they just keep you going after the carrot on the\nstick, but the carrot is always out of reach....\n\n\"Department heads' meeting beginning now,\" the automatic voice said.\n\nLee cocked an eye at the tiny device. \"All right,\" he said, getting up,\n\"I'm going.\"\n\nThe meeting was strictly routine. The reaction had set in. A week ago\nthey had all been agog with the gravity-waves discovery. Now it had\nbecome apparent that the discovery had not opened the door they were\ntrying to get through. _We're like children_, Lee thought, _trying to\nput together a stereo transceiver from an assembly kit; all the pieces\nare there, but we can't get them together in the proper way_.\n\nIt was a short meeting. As they broke up, Lee saw Richards walk over to\nElaine.\n\n\"I hear you're leaving us,\" the young physicist said. \"Going Earthside?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Elaine answered. \"For a while, at least.\"\n\nRichards broke into his feline grin again. \"Good. I'll be vacationing\non Earth in a few weeks. Do you like to ski?\"\n\n\"I haven't skied in years....\"\n\n\"There's a lodge I go to in Switzerland. Really fine. And the skiing is\nmarvelous. Even if you don't want to ski, there are mountains to\nclimb ... and glaciers....\"\n\nLee started toward them, thought better of it, and walked sullenly out\nof the room. He went to his office, sat fidgeting at his desk for a\nwhile, then called her on the intercom. She was not at her office or\nher quarters, so the equipment automatically paged her. When her face\nfinally showed on the viewscreen, Lee could see that she was still in\nthe conference room, which was now empty, except for her and Richards.\n\n\"What is it, Sid?\"\n\n\"Uh ... can you come down to my office for a minute? Right now?\"\n\nShe quickly covered her surprise. \"Of course. I'll be right down.\"\n\n\n\nWithin a few minutes, she was entering his office. \"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" he said, gesturing her to a chair. \"I just wanted to get you\nout of the grips of that All-American physicist.\"\n\n\"What? Why, you jealous old goat!\"\n\n\"Never mind. If you want to listen to propositions, please make sure\nI'm out of earshot.\"\n\nShe laughed. \"Is that what you brought me down here for?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I'm flattered.\"\n\n\"Don't be cute.\"\n\n\"He's a very nice boy.\"\n\nHe frowned. \"All right, so I'm foolish and juvenile....\"\n\n\"And he's so interesting,\" she went on, paying no attention. \"He was\ntelling me all about glaciers. In Switzerland. Near this ski lodge.\nSeems the glaciers have been growing during the past few years.\nSomething I should really be sure to see.\"\n\n\"Sounds fascinating,\" Lee grumbled.\n\n\"Oh, it is. The glaciers, that is. They were retreating, you know,\nuntil a few years ago. Now they're growing again. Goes in cycles, it\nseems....\"\n\nLee suddenly stiffened. \"Great God of our forefathers!\"\n\n\"What now?\"\n\nInstead of answering, he scrambled out of his chair and went to the\nfloor-to-ceiling bookcase that lined one wall of the office.\n\n\"Sid, what's the matter? Did I say something....\"\n\nBut he was not listening to her. \"That's it,\" he was muttering, \"That\n_must_ be it.\"\n\nElaine watched him paw through the shelves of books, desperately\nsearching for something.\n\n\"Can I help?\" she asked.\n\n\"No. I think ...\" he snatched at a book and riffled through it. \"Yes!\nLook at it!\"\n\nHe wheeled and shoved the open book at her. She nearly dropped it as he\nducked back around his desk and rummaged through a pile of papers.\n\n\"Here it is. Look at them!\" he shouted, handing her a sheet of paper.\n\"Put them side by side and look at them.\"\n\nThe book was opened to a graph, Elaine saw, that showed the advance and\nretreat of the Ice Age glaciers over the past million years on Earth.\nThe sheet of paper was Childe's graph of the wave patterns of the\nmachine's antennas.\n\nHer face went pale as she looked at the two graphs, side by side.\n\"They ... they're the same ... almost identical.\"\n\n\"It all fits together now,\" Lee said, drumming his fingers on the\ndesktop in a restless tattoo. \"The machine beams gravity waves into\nthe interplanetary plasma between the Sun and Mercury. The effect is\ninfinitesimal, by our short-term standards, but over a hundred thousand\nyears or so, the cumulative effect must be enough to block off a small\nfraction of the Sun's radiation. The Earth goes into a deep freeze for\na few millennia!\"\n\n\"But why?\" Elaine asked. \"Why did the Others build it?\"\n\n\n\nLee paced nervously across the room. \"Think a minute. They had beaten\nthe Earthmen in a bitter interstellar war. They had done their best to\nwipe out the human race. What better way to insure their victory than\nby subjecting our homeworld to violent climate changes? They probably\nthought they were guaranteeing the complete extinction of mankind.\"\n\n\"But the Ice Ages didn't destroy man,\" Elaine said.\n\n\"No. They reduced him to the level of a beast, though. Those few\nsurvivors of the interstellar war were robbed of their civilization.\nThey had to go back to living in caves, to fighting the other animals\nfor sheer survival. They made it, though, and re-learned what was lost,\nand built a new civilization.\"\n\n\"Then the machine failed its purpose.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Lee said. \"But remember, it's only an automatic machine.\nThose who made it, the Others, they're still out there among the stars\nsomewhere. They're going to be mighty upset when they find out that\nwe're not dead.\"\n\n\"It's ... terrifying ... in a way.\"\n\n\"The important thing is that we _understand_. Now we can face them,\nwherever they are. They're no more intelligent than we are. We've\nproved that by learning what the machine is all about. They may be\nolder, and they certainly know more tricks, but they're not on a\ncompletely higher plain of mental development.\"\n\nElaine leaned back in her seat. \"Well, it's over. At last it's ended.\nWe can leave Titan for good now.\"\n\n\"Leave? Not likely. Now we can finally start to tear the machinery\napart and see how it works. We've just been sniffing around it so far,\ntreating it like a museum exhibit. Now we can shut the damned thing\noff and start dissecting it. There's a lot to be done, a whole new\ntechnology to be learned. How does it work? Who are the Others and\nwhere did they come from? There are more questions to answer now than\never.\"\n\n\"That means that you won't be leaving Titan?\" she asked.\n\n\"Not for a while. How about you?\"\n\nShe thought for a moment, then answered, \"If you're right about all\nthis, then there should be a lot of archeological evidence awaiting\ndiscovery on the Moon. Maybe I should organize a team....\"\n\n\"Then you're leaving anyway,\" he said.\n\n\"For a while, Sid. I'll be back in time.\"\n\n\"Stay off the ski slopes.\"\n\nShe grinned and got up from her chair. Lee kissed her, and she turned\naway and went to the door. She looked back to say a final word, but he\nwas already at his desk, punching buttons on the automatic secretary:\n\n\"All right, you mechanical marvel, call the department heads to the\nconference room for a meeting in five minutes. And take a message\nfor the Terran Council Science Committee--Gentlemen: It is my belief\nthat the question of the alien machinery on Titan is now essentially\nsolved....\"\n\n\n                                THE END",
