    "body": "Ingomar Bjorgson knew he was going to die.\n\nHe turned his back on his useless ship and went inside the bubble house\nthat had been his home for ninety-nine days. Methodically he donned his\nall-weather clothes, his environment suit. He did not want to die in\nthis place. Here was food and refrigeration for the days, warmth and\ncomfort for the nights. He could not bring himself to put a gun to his\nhead, or end it by any other direct, willful act. But out there in the\ndesert, away from man-made helps for survival ... there a man could get\nhimself into circumstances where nature took care of it.\n\nThat was his reason for being here on this lonely planet, in the first\nplace--the promise of finding intelligent life. For intelligence was\nrare in the universe, after all. A lone adventurer, a year before,\nforced down on this planet by a cosmic storm, had waited a week here\nfor the storm to subside, then had landed on Earth with the feverish\nnews of intelligent life. Ingomar Bjorgson had come to investigate.\n\nBirds, yet.\n\n\n\nThey were only two. Two birds with minds like the edge of a razor,\nliving alone on this planet that was one hundred per cent desert.\n\nHe took one last look around the bubble, then walked out, leaving the\ndoor open. From ten feet away he watched the sand already blowing in\nthrough the doorway, and he felt very lonely and small. He knew that\nhis death, like his life, would never be marked anywhere with any\ndegree of permanence.\n\nHe walked. There was no hurry, so he walked slowly, stopping\noccasionally to turn and stare at the tracks his feet had scuffed in\nthe sand, watching sand drift into them. He smiled wryly. The universe\nwas so eager to be rid of him--as if he were a disease.\n\nHe looked up again, studying the whole sky. But there was no movement\nof wings, no silver streak of a ship coming to pick him up. Only one\nspot marred the desert's domain--the tiny bright reflection of the\nburning sun on the now distant bubble.\n\nThe birds had promised him. They had been so sure of themselves.\n\nWhen he knew that the fierce sun and wind would kill him before he\ncould get back to the bubble, he started removing his all-weather\nclothes. He flung them aside like a dancer. Coat to the left, trousers\nto the right. The hot wind threw the trousers back against his face. He\ntore them off with a curse. Shirt to the left. He kept the shoes on,\nout of respect for his feet. Then he trudged on, wondering vaguely how\na half dressed man, dying on his feet, could make the same marks in the\nsand as a fully clothed, comfortable one.\n\nHe stumbled on an outcropping of rock. He fell. He picked himself up\nagain. It would be quick, after all. The sun was in league with the\nrest of the universe. He would die soon.\n\nHe fell again.\n\nHe had found the planet of Lorrane easily. The adventurer's charts were\naccurate. It was a dry, barren place, an old, worn-out world where only\nwind and sand moved, where mountains shoved their eroded peaks into\nthe impotent sky. But Ingomar found, upon emerging from his ship, that\nthere was another movement. Two black dots appeared far away in the sky\nand rapidly grew larger. He had been told that the planet was populated\nby an intelligent form of bird life. Two were approaching now.\n\nHe smiled to himself. \"Imagine that,\" he said to himself, \"A smart\nbird. How should you meet a smart bird? Should you shake hands?\"\n\nThe birds alighted in the sand before him. They eyed him with bright,\nintelligent eyes. They were quite large, standing at least two feet\ntall. Their gray feathers lay smooth and straight, immaculately cared\nfor. Ingomar cast around in his mind for something to say, or some sign\nto make that indicated friendship.\n\nThen one of the birds looked at the other and said, \"This one is\nlarger.\"\n\n\"Much,\" the other replied.\n\nIngomar was astonished. \"You can talk?\" he asked, \"In English?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Didn't the first man tell how he instructed us?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, of course,\" Ingomar said, confused. \"But I didn't remem ...\nthat is.... Well, I didn't believe it.\"\n\nThe birds eyed each other again. \"I like him,\" one said. \"If there's\nanything I hate, it's a completely honest person.\"\n\nThe other gave him a vicious peck on his back. \"Shut up!\" it said, \"Do\nyou want him to think we condone dishonesty?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" the other retorted hotly, \"I just meant that,\nconsidering social protocol, it is sometimes kind to tell a very small\nlie.\"\n\n\n\nIngomar was speechless. He looked back at his ship, standing tall and\nstraight, ready to blast itself into the sky again. He glanced around\nat the lonely landscape. Finally he said, \"It is difficult to see a\ndifference between you two. Do you have names that I might be able to\nuse?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. We beg your pardon. How uncivil of us. Our name, translated\ninto your tongue, is Pisces.\"\n\n\"The fish?\"\n\n\"Well,\" they said, \"from our home planet the constellation does not\nlook like a fish.\"\n\n\"Oh. Well, are both of you named Pisces? Oh, I see. That is your\nspecies. I am called Man; you are called Pisces.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" they said, \"You were right the first time. Pisces is\nour name. You can say, 'Pisces, get me that ship.' And we would do so.\"\n\n\"How can both of you have the same name? Are you actually one\nintelligence? And see that you keep your hands ... I mean, see that you\nleave my ship alone.\"\n\nOne said, \"We wouldn't think of touching your ship.\" The other said,\n\"No, we are two separate entities.\"\n\nIngomar passed a hand over his face, thinking. The two very\nEarth-looking birds stood quietly before him, their feet buried in the\nsand so that it looked like their legs were two stilts shoved into the\nground. At last he said, \"Well, I know what we'll do. I will call you\nPisces I,\" he pointed to the bird on his left, \"and your companion\nPisces II.\"\n\nThe identical birds glanced at each other, then leapt into the air.\nThey circled high above his head. They swooped low. They engaged in\nmarvelous aerial gymnastics wonderful to see. Ingomar made notes in his\nbook concerning their agility. Finally they came to rest before him\nagain, so suddenly that he stepped backward quickly, frightened.\n\n\"Now,\" they said, \"which one of us is Pisces I and which is Pisces II?\"\n\nPuzzled, Ingomar studied them carefully. The one with the quick temper\nmight show this characteristic in some way. He pointed to the bird on\nhis right. \"You,\" he said, \"are Pisces I.\"\n\nThey laughed. It was a verbal sound only. No expression showed in their\neyes.\n\n\n\n\"All right,\" Ingomar said, after some thought. \"I can fix that.\" He\nentered his ship and rummaged around in his clothes locker, then\nemerged with a brilliant red ribbon of plastic. \"I'll tie this to your\nleg. That way I'll know that you are Pisces I. If you promise not to\nmove it from one to the other.\"\n\n\"We promise.\"\n\nHe stooped over to tie the plastic on the leg of the one he thought was\nPisces I, and was almost caught in the sudden flurry of slashing beaks\nand raking claws, like a mating fight in an aviary.\n\n\"_I_ am Pisces I,\" one screamed, administering a resounding peck on the\nother's back.\n\n\"No, you're not. I am.\" This one leapt into the air and landed on the\nother's back. He raked vicious, long talons across the well-groomed\nfeathers. \"I am more intelligent than you. _I_ should be Pisces I.\"\n\nFrom a safe ten feet away, Ingomar threw the ribbon at them. \"Stop it!\"\nhe yelled.\n\nThey obeyed instantly, and stood quietly side by side facing him.\nIngomar drew his hand gun and pointed it at them. \"Now stop your\nfighting, or I'll blow you to kingdom come.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" they said. \"Anything to get off this miserable planet. How far\nis it?\"\n\nIngomar smiled, in spite of his anger. \"It's an expression. It means I\nwill destroy you.\"\n\nOne of the birds quickly picked up the plastic ribbon and carried it\nto the other, and dropped it near the leg. Then both took it in their\nbeaks and together they tied it around the leg. It was done so quickly\nthat Ingomar stood there aghast, surprised into immobility. He had\nnever before seen birds tie knots.\n\n\"It would not be wise to destroy us,\" Pisces I said. \"We can help you.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"You need help,\" Pisces II said. \"A storm is coming.\"\n\n\"A cosmic storm?\" Ingomar asked. \"I'm not worried about that. I'll stay\nhere until it moves on.\"\n\nPisces I shook his head. \"A planetary storm.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"Sometime tonight.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Ingomar said. \"Thanks. I'll stay inside.\"\n\n\"It's not so easy as that. You must blast off and put your ship in\norbit for the night.\"\n\n\"Why? Do you know how much fuel it takes to get into orbit? I have none\nto spare.\"\n\nPisces II scratched in the sand with his claws, thinking. Then he said,\n\"Only one alternative exists. If you remain, the storm will wreck your\nship. Take us aboard now, and blast off for your home planet. To stay\nhere means death.\"\n\nIngomar snorted and turned back toward his ship. He thought, \"Take\nthem aboard my ship? Not in a million years.\" He saw their plan, now.\nThey wanted to get into his ship. Then, by some means he could not now\nforesee, they would take the ship away from him.\n\n\n\nHe was so shaken by this conclusion that he quickly retreated to\nsafety, closing the airlock. The birds stayed outside. They were\narguing between themselves. He could tell by the gesticulations they\nmade with their heads. Once Pisces I attacked Pisces II viciously,\nraking him mercilessly with sharp talons. Pisces II fought back\nferociously. They rolled over and over in the sand. Ingomar threw a\nswitch that gave him communication outside the ship, and yelled at them.\n\nThey stopped fighting at once. He said, \"Have you two lost your minds?\"\n\nPisces II laughed. \"Now how could one lose his mind? It goes with him\neverywhere.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Ingomar said. \"I meant, have you become insane?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" Pisces I said. \"We are peaceful entities. We\nintentionally developed this argument to break the monotony of life\nhere.\"\n\n\"Is it so bad as that?\"\n\n\"It is terrible. Will you take us aboard?\"\n\nIngomar did not answer, but switched the communicator off and busied\nhimself with recording his observations. He took advantage of their\ncontinued presence and took photographs.\n\nFinally, after several hours, they leapt into the air and flew away\ntoward the distant mountains. Ingomar was sorry to see them leave, and\nmore than once checked his instruments for signs of a coming storm in\ncase they were right. But nothing outside had changed.\n\nAfter they had left he opened the ship and stepped outside, taking\nreadings with instruments to record the character of the planet. He\ntrudged through the eternally drifting sand, looking for some sign of\nlife. No plants, insects, animals anywhere. Only the fine, mobile sand,\noccasionally an outcropping of rock not yet eroded away. And the heat!\nIngomar was forced to turn the controls of his environment suit almost\nall the way up to keep comfortable. Then, when the sun receded behind\nthe ghostly barren mountains, the cold came creeping in. Ingomar turned\nhis controls in the other direction, while walking back to his ship. He\nwas afraid he would not keep the cold outside.\n\nThe landscape, with the sun's absence, was dark and fearful. Shadows\nmoved in the wind, shadows of drifting sand that took on the\nshapes of monsters lurking in the darkness. Ingomar was not one to\nfrighten easily, but the night took on such ominous sighs and moans\nand movements that his imagination began to magnify them beyond\nrecognition. When he finally saw the ship loom up before him he ran,\nstumbling toward it. He fumbled in the darkness for the control knob\nto open the lock and found it at last. He leapt inside, accompanied by\na cold blast of wind and sand, and stood there panting, hearing his\nheart pound in his ears.\n\nThe night was long and lonely. He was too far from civilization for\nhis radio equipment to bring the comfort of familiar sounds. He tried\nto read, but found concentration impossible. He thought of the birds,\nwondering where they were now, how they kept from freezing to death at\nnight. He rewrote his notes, adding remembered facts and impressions.\nFinally he decided sleep was the most painless way of spending the\nnight, and swallowed a small capsule designed to induce total sleep for\nat least six hours.\n\n\n\nHe awoke the next morning standing on his head.\n\nThe bed, horizontal the night before, was now vertical. The whole room\nwas vertical. Panic swept over him like a wave of burning fire. He\nscrambled to the airlock. It opened grotesquely.\n\nThe ship, which last night had stood so proudly, now lay on its side.\nAnd in his drugged sleep he had not known when it fell. For Ingomar,\nthe bottom dropped out of everything, and his heart dropped with it.\nThere was no resetting of a ship once it had fallen. This took special\nequipment. Ingomar Bjorgson was a doomed man, and he knew it.\n\nWhile he stood outside in the morning sun, staring at the horrible\nspectacle before him, the two birds alighted, one on each side.\n\n\"Why didn't you listen to us?\" Pisces I said in an accusing tone.\n\n\"Yes,\" Pisces II echoed angrily. \"You make me sick, thinking you're\nso smart, coming down here in your big ship and strutting around like\nyou think you're a God, or something. Now, how big do you feel? Do you\nrealize that this is our first opportunity to leave this planet? I've a\ngood notion to peck your stupid eyes out right here and now.\"\n\n\"Leave him be,\" Pisces I said. \"He may not be so bright, but I think\nhe would have taken us with him, after he got used to us and saw how\nharmless we are.\"\n\nPisces II leapt at him, almost knocking Ingomar off his feet. \"Shut up!\nI've a good notion to peck your eyes out, too.\"\n\n\"Oh, stop it!\" Ingomar said wearily. \"We're all doomed to spend the\nrest of our lives here. How was I to know that the storm would be so\nbad? My instruments gave no indication whatever.\"\n\n\"Actually, it was our fault,\" Pisces II said, more calmly. \"We failed\nto mention the nature of the storm. We thought you knew. It was a\nmagnetic storm. A shifting of magnetic currents surrounding the planet.\nWe had no idea that you would think of the weather.\"\n\nThey walked with him around the fallen ship. It was not injured, that\nmuch Ingomar could see. The soft bed of sand had cushioned its fall. If\nit could only be righted! Ingomar knew it was impossible.\n\n\"It is pointed toward that knoll out there. See? Suppose we all got\ninside and blasted off. We would slide along and maybe when we reached\nthe knoll we'd have enough speed to keep on going in a straight line\nuntil we could point her nose upward.\"\n\nIngomar shook his head, but he appreciated the suggestion. It indicated\nthat they were willing to try anything. He knew their motives were not\nentirely philanthropic, but he liked them more for it, anyway.\n\nHe said, \"There is only one way out, and that is for someone to come in\nand get us.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Pisces II said, \"What are you waiting for? Call them.\"\n\n\"I can't. We are too far out for communication.\"\n\nThe two gray birds eyed one another in disbelief. Pisces I scratched\nhis breast impolitely. Then he said, \"Are you telling us that you have\ncome this far from your own solar system, knowing that you could not\ncall for help, if necessary?\"\n\nIngomar nodded.\n\n\n\nPisces II snorted through his beak, and scratched in the sand.\n\"Stupidity,\" he said. \"There is no other word for it.\"\n\n\"Yes, there is,\" Pisces I answered, somewhat sharply. \"In fact, there\nare several possible words. Bravery. Desperation. Actually I think\nit is a combination of both. I am sure that you are aware how rare\nintelligent life is in the universe. When you heard of us, you rushed\nout here at once. I would call it bravery to go beyond the sound of the\nvoices of your kind. You are desperate because you are lonely in an\nalmost empty universe.\"\n\n\"We must help him,\" said Pisces II.\n\n\"Of course. But first let's make him comfortable. It will be a long\nwait.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Ingomar said, moved by their sympathy. \"But you cannot\nhelp. Or do you have a way to send messages?\"\n\n\"Yes, in a way,\" Pisces II said, \"You see....\"\n\nPisces I lifted a huge wing and knocked Pisces II in the sand. He\nturned to Ingomar. \"Do you promise to take us with you, if we should\nsucceed in getting help?\"\n\nIngomar did not think it over. \"Yes,\" he said.\n\n\"Then we will do it. But first we must make you comfortable. Do you\nhave equipment for shelter, besides the ship?\"\n\n\"Yes, there is the bubble. It can be expanded to become a house.\"\n\n\"Get it,\" Pisces II said.\n\nIngomar did. He dragged it outside and began to unfold it, in\npreparation for inflation. But Pisces II stopped him. \"Not here,\" he\nsaid. \"It will be a long time. Our calculation is that it will take at\nleast forty-five days to get help. The trip from your planet alone is\nat least forty days. You will not wish to stare at your toppled ship\nfor so long. I suggest we go beyond the first knoll.\"\n\nPisces I laughed and said to Ingomar, \"For once he is using his brain.\nWe will carry it.\"\n\nHe grasped the bubble in his claws, flapped his enormous wings and\nsailed off. Soon he returned, and among the three of them all his food\nand books and any equipment he might need was carried over the knoll\nout of sight of the wrecked ship.\n\n\"We will not return,\" they said, \"until the rescue ship arrives. So\nmake yourself comfortable. Do not stray too far from the ship. This is\nthe most miserable planet in the universe. Give us plenty of time. We\nknow we can summon help, but we do not know how long it will take. We\nmay need as many as seventy-five days.\"\n\nIngomar settled down to wait.\n\n\n\nThe fierce, burning sun had turned Ingomar's face and naked arms into\nfried areas of intense pain, but he regained consciousness when he felt\nthe coolness of the ointment. It penetrated deep down, under the burned\nskin, into flesh and muscle, soothing injured cells.\n\nHe opened his eyes. He moved his head. The eyes were burned and\nbloodshot, but he could see a ship standing a hundred feet away. It was\nnot sleek and long, pointing its needle nose at the sky, though. It was\nround, dull white, like a giant egg laid by a giant bird.\n\nBird? Ingomar chuckled, senses returning, thinking through his pain of\nPisces I or Pisces II laying an egg. Then he laughed aloud.\n\nHe stopped, quite abruptly, and looked again. The egg was still there,\nbut it was not an egg. It was actually a ship and the airlock was open\nand Pisces II was backing out, dragging a sort of stretcher on wheels.\n\n\"It's a ... a ... ship!\" he exclaimed, tears running down his cheeks,\nover the ointment. \"Whose ship is it?\"\n\n\"Ours,\" said Pisces I.\n\n\"Yours?\" Ingomar said, after a long pause while the pain raged over\nhis skin. He tried to sit up, and Pisces I got behind him and pushed,\nnudging him upright. \"Where did you get it?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Pisces II interrupted. \"We had it all the time.\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" Pisces I yelled. \"He asked me.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue,\" Pisces II retorted hotly, \"or I'll take off and\nleave you here. I've had enough of you in the past century to last a\nlifetime.\"\n\nPisces I said to Ingomar, \"Pay no attention to that peasant.\" He helped\nPisces II push the stretcher next to Ingomar. Then he pushed a lever\nand the stretcher reduced itself to ground height. It was too short\nfor Ingomar's body, having been designed for the body of a bird. \"He's\nright, though,\" Pisces I continued, giving the stretcher a kick because\nit wasn't long enough. \"We had the ship all along. It was despicable of\nus to deceive you, but our ship was defective, and we needed yours for\nparts.\"\n\nIngomar shook his head. \"There was no magnetic storm?\"\n\nPisces II nodded his head. \"Oh, yes, there was a storm. But not a\nnatural phenomenon, I'm sorry to say. Too bad. The natural storms are\nmuch more beautiful.\"\n\n\"And you had the bubble set up away from the ship so I wouldn't see\nyou steal the parts?\"\n\nThey hung their heads. \"Despicable,\" they said. \"A rotten thing to do.\"\n\nIngomar was too ill for anger. \"Let me understand this,\" he said. \"You\nruined my ship to get parts for yours. Why? Why not just take my ship?\"\n\n\"Too slow,\" Pisces II said. He took the container of ointment in his\nbeak and set it beside Ingomar's hand. \"Here, you can rub it on by\nyourself now. Get busy.\"\n\nPisces I said, \"By your standards our planet is a terrible distance\naway. Your ship would take too long. Hurry, now. We've got to take you\nto ... what do you call it, Earth? What an odd name! We're in sort of a\nhurry to get home, as you might imagine.\"\n\nIngomar hurried. With the help of the mysterious, healing ointment he\nwas soon able to get up and make his way to the ship.\n\n\"One more question,\" he said. \"Your ship was defective and you set down\nhere and you've been here for a long time, and you're a long way from\nhome. What were you doing so far from home, in the first place?\"\n\n\"What do you suppose?\" said Pisces I irritably. \"We were looking for\nintelligent life. Get a move on, now. If we don't waste too much time\non this Earth, we may still find some!\"",
