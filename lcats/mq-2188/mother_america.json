    "body": "The tall young man faded back quickly, poised for an instant and then\nthrew a long high pass. The crowd came up roaring. Twenty yards from the\ngoal line a smaller, sturdier player swerved quickly around the end and\ntook the pass in his stride. With a beautiful curving run he tricked the\nfullback, crossed the line and then, showing no sign of effort, trotted\nback up the field and threw the ball to the umpire.\n\n\"Wonderful! What a magnificent runner that lad is! You're lucky to have\nhim, George.\" The speaker, a trimly built, athletic man in his middle\nforties turned to his companion, talking loudly above the buzz of the\ncrowd.\n\nGeorge Turner nodded agreement. \"We are. Every other University in the\nStates was after him. He's the first Boy America you know. We've been\nwatching him for years.\"\n\n\"The first Boy America?\" John Harmon echoed in surprise. \"I didn't know\nthat. You did say Boy America ... not All American?\"\n\n\"He's both; All American in football and a Boy America too.\"\n\nThe gun signalled the end of the game and the two men rose from their\nbox seats to go out. Directly below them the players trotted quickly\ntowards the dressing rooms. Harmon leaned over to watch.\n\n\"There he is now. A fine-looking boy too!\" He studied the young man's\nface intently. \"Y'know he reminds me of somebody ... somebody I know\nwell, but I can't put my finger on it.\"\n\n\"I'm not surprised. He's Gloria Manson's boy.\"\n\nHarmon frowned. \"No, that's not it, George. Of course there's the\nresemblance to his mother ... and who could forget the glorious Gloria\neven after twenty years. But it was the way he moved, and that smile.\"\nHe shook his head. \"It'll come to me yet.\"\n\nThey took the belt walk to the parking area and stepped off it at\nGeorge's car. Moving quietly on its air cushion, the car joined the\nline-up out on the main road where George locked the controls on to\nRoute 63. The speed rose to eighty and steadied as the car settled into\nits place in the traffic pattern. Relaxed in their seats the two men lit\ntheir anticancers and puffed contentedly as they watched the scenery. It\nwould be another hour before George would need to touch the controls as\nthey neared home.\n\n\"So he looks like someone you know?\" George asked. \"I'd like to know who\nit is just out of curiosity. As you are aware, no one but the Genetic\nPanel knows whose sperm is used to impregnate the Mother America.\"\n\n\"I haven't got it yet, George, but I will. Were you the geneticist for\nthis boy?\"\n\n\"Yes, I was. I told you he was Gloria Manson's. Don't you remember when\nyou met her?\"\n\n\"Soaring satellites!\" Harmon exclaimed. \"How could I forget? You\nintroduced me to her.\"\n\n\"Twenty years ago,\" Turner mused. \"What a crazy week that was. I guess\nyou were glad to get back to the Space Force.\"\n\n\"In a way,\" Harmon agreed. \"I've often wondered where you were since\nthen. I never dreamed you'd be Dean of the Genetics Faculty when I came\nto the Space Engineering School.\"\n\n\"I hope you'll like it here,\" George said. \"They couldn't have picked a\nbetter Director.\"\n\n\n\nThe senator from Alaska had the floor. He had had it for several hours\nnow and the chamber was almost empty as he droned on.\n\n\"And so, gentlemen, I feel that the greatest state in the union, the\nonly state that can afford to increase its population because there is\nstill some unoccupied space, the only state where anti-conception\nvaccination is not compulsory until after four children instead of two,\nthe state where ordinary people will have room to get out and exercise\ninstead of being spectators, this state of Alaska, I say, is the only\nstate that should be considered when we select a fine, virile American\nmale as the father of America's Child of the Year. I would dare to go\nfarther and say we should also provide the female, Mother America of\n1995, except that our President, my fellow Alaskan, has generously\ndecided that no one state can have both mother and father. Alaska is a\nman's country. It should provide the man ...\"\n\nWearily George Turner got up and turned off the colorvision. The\npolitical pressures were increasing rapidly; that was obvious. What had\nstarted as a national search for the most suitable future parents in\nAmerica would soon be a free-for-all. He would have to give the\ncommittee his choice, and quickly! Back to his work he went; calculating\npossibilities, eliminating entrants one by one. The National Genetics\nLaboratory had been given the task of screening the finalists from each\nstate and Turner, much against his will, had been selected by the\nDirector to do the work.\n\n\"George,\" he'd said one fateful morning, \"I have a job for you.\"\n\n\"What's that, sir?\"\n\n\"You've seen the report of this new contest being run by Dee Lish Baby\nFoods, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Can't say I have, sir. I've been working on that new sex gene. Haven't\nhad time to read the papers.\"\n\n\"Oh? Well it all started on their colorvision program, the one where\nthey select the All American babies. You've seen it haven't you?\"\n\n\n\nTurner shook his head.\n\n\"Sputtering sputniks! I know you're all wrapped up in your work but it\ndoesn't have to be a shroud. You'd better get out into the world a\nlittle.\" The Director laid a friendly arm on George's shoulder. \"This\njob will be just the thing.\"\n\n\"What job?\"\n\n\"Why, the contest! Dee Lish separate the babies into three groups.\nThere's the natural All American baby selected from families in the\ntwo-baby group; then there's a prize for best baby in the unlimited\nfamily section. Naturally, since those parents are in the genetically\nsuperior group, it wouldn't be fair to pit them against the two-baby\nfamilies. Then there's a class for babies of artificially impregnated\nmothers, both married and single. It's a very popular program. The\nprizes are wonderful and the winners in the limited family class are\nallowed to have more children than their quota, all expenses paid of\ncourse.\"\n\n\"I can see why it's popular all right,\" George said, \"but where do I\ncome in?\"\n\n\n\n\"Three months ago the Dee Lish scenario writers had a brainstorm. They\nreasoned that if they began a new contest to pick the most suitable\nmother in America and then had her impregnated, artificially of course,\nby the most suitable donor, they would stir up all sorts of excitement\nfor the next nine months and produce a baby that should be a\nworldbeater. The mother would be given a tremendous annuity, for life,\nand the babe assured of all expenses right through college.\"\n\n\"It all sounds faintly nauseating to me.\"\n\n\"George, you're impossible. A geneticist who still believes in\nfortuitous breeding!\"\n\n\"I'm not so darn sure we can pick 'em better any other way. We certainly\nhaven't got all the answers.\"\n\n\"I agree, George, I agree,\" the Director's smile was still friendly, if\na little strained. \"This is a National Laboratory, however, and the\nPresident rang me up the other day and asked that we do the final\nscreening.\"\n\n\"The President? But this is a commercial gag!\"\n\n\"Not any longer, my boy. You see the Russians recently came out with a\nwonder drug, a sort of gene stimulator, that they claim produces highly\nintelligent and well-proportioned children. The Chinese now claim that,\nby using a controlled environment in their communes, they are producing\na super race. We had to do something! Our side is going to claim that\nthe union of a red-blooded American male and a modern capitalist female\nwill produce offspring far superior to anything else in the world, thus\ndemonstrating the supremacy of the American way of life.\"\n\n\"Dear God! Why pick me?\"\n\n\"You're junior to all the others, for one thing. And besides, you'll\nstill be around to see Boy America grow up.\"\n\n\"Boy America?\"\n\n\"Each year there will be a new contest; a boy the first year, a girl the\nsecond and so on. You'll have to appear on colorvision of course. It\nwill be a nice change for you, and good for the Laboratory too! New York\nis a grand town for a vacation.\"\n\n\n\n\"New York is a grand town for a vacation,\" George thought bitterly, as\nhe parried the reporters' persistent questions in the lobby of\nColoraudio System a week later.\n\n\"Say Doc, what about this super-female from Texas,\" one needler shouted\nabove the babble.\n\n\"So what about her?\" George said gruffly.\n\n\"Senator Bragg says she should be the one selected for Mother America.\"\n\n\"Look, friend, Senator Bragg is a Texan and a politician. Naturally he\nwants his state to have the honor. I'll pick the one I think best\nqualified!\"\n\n\"Yeah, Doc, we know. But what is this super-female gag anyway?\"\n\n\"Some women have more female sex genes than others. She happens to have\nthe most ever reported to the Genetic Registry. Has the Senator seen\nher?\"\n\n\"He didn't say.\"\n\n\"He should take a look sometime. She's five feet five, one hundred and\nsixty pounds and looks like a Texas longhorn, without the horns.\" He\nbrushed past the reporter. \"You got any more bright ideas?\"\n\nA New York reporter pulled on his coat sleeve. Annoyed by their\npersistence Turner shrugged free.\n\n\"Doctor Turner,\" the man said. \"What do you think of this idea of using\nthe Man from Mars as the male donor?\"\n\n\"You mean Captain Jack Harmon of the Space Force?\"\n\n\"Yes. He's in town for the big parade right now.\"\n\n\"Look, we can't tell you who the donor will be. It's against the law,\nremember?\" Turner quoted the rule, \"Under Section 48b, single females\nmay bear children if they wish, when authorized by law, but are not\nallowed to pick the donor. He must remain anonymous. The local Genetics\nPanel does the choosing. Besides, Harmon has been in space for months.\nWho knows what changes there may be in his sex glands.\"\n\nThey reached the conference room and entered. The Dee Lish\nrepresentative looked at his watch and raised his hands.\n\n\"Gentlemen, no more questions please. We have a program on the air\ntonight and Doctor Turner has to be prepared.\" When the room cleared he\nturned to George. \"Doctor, will you be ready to name the winner on\ntonight's program?\"\n\nTurner shook his head. \"You know I've interviewed all the finalists but\none, Miss Gloria Manson. Until I see her I can't decide. I haven't\ntalked to her at all but her press agent promised he would have her here\nthis afternoon.\"\n\n\"That's Gloria Manson the actress-dramatist?\"\n\n\"Yes, the one who wrote _The Canals of Mars_ and takes the female lead.\"\n\n\"Roaring rockets! If she wins what a blastoff that will be.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"We have arranged with the Mayor of New York that the winner will ride\nwith Captain Jack Harmon tomorrow in the big parade celebrating his\nreturn from Mars. And Miss Manson is the star in a hilarious hit about\nspace. What could be better?\"\n\n\"To stop the whole damn foolishness altogether,\" said George gloomily\nand ignored the hurt look on the press agent's face.\n\n\n\nThey were getting up to leave when the door burst open and slammed\nagainst the wall. A tall, beautifully dressed and shaped brunette\nbrushed aside a little man who was trying to talk to her and strode into\nthe room. Her green eyes narrowed like a cat's after a bird.\n\n\"Which of you is the geneticist?\" she demanded, and then to George, \"You\n... you must be ... you aren't dressed like a business man. Your suit is\nfive years out of style.\"\n\nAbashed, George looked at himself. \"What's wrong with it?\"\n\n\"You'd never understand and I haven't time to tell you. What I want to\nknow is, who gave you the right to use my name in this silly Mother\nAmerica contest. And you,\" she turned on the Dee Lish agent, \"quit\ngawping at me. I'm not going to blast off. Who are you anyway?\"\n\n\"Miss Manson, please!\" The little man was in front of her again. \"If the\nreporters hear about this ...\"\n\n\"Oh shut up, Harry! All right, Doctor, what's your excuse?\"\n\nGeorge rallied and attacked. \"I haven't any, Miss Manson. I didn't ask\nfor your name. It was submitted to me as a possibility from the Dee\nLish Company. You needn't worry, however. You are displaying adequate\nreasons for me to disqualify your entry right now.\"\n\n\"Oh, an advertising stunt, is it? Harry, this is your idea ... you and\nthat pap purveyor!\"\n\n\"But Gloria, think of the publicity ... the big parade with the man from\nMars! Why your play would run for years!\"\n\n\"OK, I'll do it!\" she said with a big smile and watched the ad-men's\ngloomy faces change to astonished delight. \"There's just one little\nthing ... if I win!\" She prodded Harry in the chest with a long stiff\nfinger.\n\n\"Yes, dear ... anything!\"\n\n\"_YOU_ have the baby!\" The scowl came back to her face. \"You utter\nidiots ... you misfired missiles! How in the Universe do you think I can\nplay a romantic lead wearing a maternity dress?\"\n\nGeorge chuckled with delight at the thought and she turned on him.\n\n\"What's so funny, Doctor? And what do you mean I'm disqualified from the\ncontest? What's wrong with me?\"\n\n\"Not a thing, Miss Manson.\" He grinned happily at her. \"But if you can\nstand having dinner with a man in an old-fashioned suit, I'll tell you\nwhy Mother America should be a contented cow instead of a tantalizing\ntigress.\"\n\n\"Hm, this is one orbit I haven't travelled.\" She smiled and nodded her\napproval. \"Set me a course, Navigator.\"\n\nThey moved towards the door together.\n\n\"Doctor! The program tonight ... have you forgotten?\"\n\nGeorge looked back and waved airily. \"Don't worry. I'll be there. And\nwe'll name the winner too!\"\n\n\n\n\"Well now, Gloria, the dessert!\" George was saying. \"What'll it be,\ncrepes suzette?\"\n\nShe smiled across the table. \"Mm,\" she considered the menu carefully. \"I\nthink I'll stick to good old American apple pie and cheese.\"\n\n\"A genuine American small town girl, with small town likes and dislikes!\nThat's what you are underneath the glamour. Aren't you?\"\n\nShe laughed and raised her champagne glass. \"And this is from the\nhome-town vineyard too?\"\n\nGeorge leaned towards her, his face a little flushed with the wine.\n\"Gloria, with your ability as an actress we could play the biggest\npractical joke in the history of colorvision. If only I dared!\"\n\n\"What's your idea, George?\"\n\n\"I'm sick of all this pseudo-scientific nonsense about genetics,\" he\nsaid, \"and I'm even sicker of the crass commercialism and political\npropaganda surrounding this Mother America business.\"\n\n\"George, you surprise me more and more! I thought you did this for the\nmoney and publicity, to say nothing of the great honor.\"\n\n\"Stop kidding, Gloria! You know I was ordered to do it by the\nDepartment. All I get is an expense account from Dee Lish Baby Foods.\nThe thing that really bothers me is the type of winner I have to pick.\"\n\n\"Have to pick? You have free choice, don't you?\"\n\n\"Not really. The people who watch that program, from the President on\ndown, including our Director too, expect a sweet wholesome type ... you\nknow, curvy in the right places like a Miss America but wouldn't think\nof posing in a bathing suit. They want an adolescent dream girl type,\nthe kind that goes well with a rose-covered cottage and four\nrosy-cheeked kids all waiting for Daddy to come home.\"\n\n\"But most women work in America today.\"\n\n\"I know but the dream remains, along with the cowboy, the daring Air\nForce pilot, the self-made business tycoon and all the other romantic\nstereotypes of the first half of the century. She makes togetherness\nseem right, and God knows we have so many people today we're together\nwhether we like it or not. So that's the type I have to pick.\"\n\n\"Where does the joke come in?\"\n\n\"If you'd play the part of the American dream girl you'd win that\ncontest going away, like a four stage rocket booster.\"\n\n\"But I don't want to have a baby by remote control.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't have to. You can always withdraw before the impregnation\nceremony.\"\n\n\"Suppose I do it, what's the point?\"\n\n\"Well for one thing, you'd show how easily people are fooled by\nappearances and smart propaganda. As a geneticist I can only go so far\nand be honest. I can make sure you have good heredity; that you have no\nobvious physical or mental defects; that your chance of having certain\ndisabling diseases are small; that your intelligence is high, and so on.\nI can't really measure things such as initiative, wit, courage,\ndetermination, all the things that make one human so much better than\nanother of equal physical and mental capacity.\"\n\n\"Educated people know that already.\"\n\n\"True, but it needs constant emphasis or it is forgotten under the\npropaganda. Besides, I don't believe in mating people like cattle or\nslaves. That's why this whole thing is a travesty of love and marriage.\nI hate being used to give it a semblance of scientific authenticity. I'm\ngoing to declare the top four contestants equal. They are, as far as I\nam concerned, genetically speaking. The audience will decide the winner.\nThey'll love it and so will the sponsor. The other three are real\nAmerican dream girls. I want you to outsmart them at their own game ...\nand tell America later what a farce it all was.\"\n\n\"You really are a romantic, underneath the cynicism,\" Gloria said\nwonderingly. \"I didn't think scientists were built with hearts any\nmore.\" She reached across and took his hand. \"But I like you that way.\nDo you think I could do it?\"\n\n\"Easily. Just pretend you are Ellen the Earthling from that comedy of\nyours. That's the type they want.\"\n\n\"Yes, but when I bow out later they'll be calling me Marina the Martian\nMenace ... that won't be so funny.\"\n\n\"They won't, Gloria. You can laugh it off as a publicity stunt and get\nthem laughing with you. Who knows, it might even stop this mad fad of\ncareer women having babies without a proper home and a father to raise\nthem.\"\n\nShe laughed. \"Are you afraid you're going to be replaced by a machine,\nGeorge?\" her eyes twinkled with amusement.\n\nHe grinned. \"Oh, we still have our uses. Time to go. Will you do it?\"\n\nShe stood up. \"I'll play it by ear. If the audience is the type you say\nthey are, it will be a pleasure.\"\n\n\n\nThe parade was over. Now, as they waited for the banquet and the\nspeeches to begin, John Harmon spoke to Turner.\n\n\"You're a lucky man, George.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Spending so much time with Gloria. She had me laughing all the way up\nWall Street with her remarks about the parade. If I didn't have to go\nback to the base tomorrow I'd steal her for a date.\" He turned to\nGloria. \"I mean it, honey. You really leave me weightless!\"\n\nGloria smiled at him. \"I'll take a recount, John. We can blast off some\nother time.\"\n\nAfter the banquet the Mayor of New York made the major address of the\nevening. \"And so, ladies and gentleman,\" he concluded, \"you have seen\ntoday two people who represent the end of one era and the beginning of\nanother. The lovely lady on my right is to be the first Mother America.\nFor the first time in history, our nation is actively planning our\nfuture citizens. It is true that for years now, with the help of the\nGenetics Laboratories, represented so ably by Doctor Turner, individual\ncitizens have planned their parenthood, but never before have a\nPresident and Congress given their approval, their official blessing,\nfor such a purpose. This then is a milestone we have passed, a point in\nour history we will never forget.\"\n\n\"They'll never forget me either when I back out,\" Gloria whispered to\nGeorge. \"I'm getting worried. We're in too deep.\"\n\n\"Don't be scared, baby,\" George said. \"I'll get you out of it, if you\nhave to fall sick to do it.\" He patted her arm reassuringly but somehow,\nwithout the rosy glow of a bottle of wine to color this view, the joke\ndidn't seem as funny as it had the previous night.\n\nThe Mayor continued. \"Another point in our history was passed when this\nyoung man on my left, at that time Captain, now Major John Harmon of the\nSpace Force, returned from Mars. He and his crew represent the end of\nour isolation in space. The Moon, after all, is a satellite of Earth.\nMars is another planet, and Major Harmon has landed there. We are not\nlikely in our time to see another such event since the next big step,\nbeyond the Solar System, will require a technology we do not possess.\nSo, ladies and gentlemen, you, tonight, are witnessing the beginning of\na new age, an age of supermen borne by women of America, such as Gloria\nManson, and led by heroes such as John Harmon. I propose we drink a\ntoast to them ... together.\"\n\n\n\nAfterwards, in Gloria's apartment, the three of them sat and talked\nuntil late. Then John Harmon looked at his watch and got up to leave.\n\n\"I have to catch the ramjet out of La Guardia,\" he said. \"We start\nplanning the next space trip in Colorado tomorrow, or rather this\nmorning. It's been fun.\" He shook George's hand and kissed Gloria\nquickly. \"I'll be seeing you one of these days.\"\n\nGeorge shut the door behind him. \"I guess I'd better go now,\" he said.\n\n\"No! Have one for the road,\" Gloria said quickly. \"I want to talk to\nyou.\"\n\nGeorge poured another Scotch. \"You still worried?\"\n\n\"A bit,\" she admitted. \"What is the next step?\"\n\n\"Now I'm supposed to pick the male donor.\"\n\n\"I thought you'd done that already.\"\n\n\"No. You see we have to know what blood types the female has and what\nher genetic structure is; whether she has any antibodies against sperm\nand so on, before we pick the male. To do it before the winner is\npicked would entail a lot of unnecessary work.\"\n\n\"Then we still have some time before the impregnation ceremony?\"\n\n\"I can stall for maybe four weeks ... no longer. You see I have to\nconsider your cycle too.\" He got up to go. \"Gloria, I guess I was half\nlit last night. I'm sorry. It was a damn-fool idea.\"\n\nShe came close to him. \"But you really do believe in the old-fashioned\nmarriage, even if not in the old-fashioned girl?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do. I still think people should be in love and not just mated\nbecause a calculating machine says they'll produce superior offspring.\"\n\n\"You're sweet.\" She put her arms around his neck and kissed him. The\nkiss lasted ... and lasted. Finally George broke it off.\n\n\"My God!\" he mumbled. \"Don't we have enough problems, without this?\"\n\n\n\nThree weeks later, on Monday, George announced he had a suitable donor.\nThe New York Genetics Panel, in session, considered the records and\nannounced that permission was granted for one Gloria Manson, spinster,\nof New York City, to bear a child by artificial impregnation. The date\nwas set for Wednesday. On Tuesday night George went to Gloria's\napartment.\n\n\"What are we going to do?\" Gloria asked as she watched George wearing a\npath on the rug. \"We've left it awfully late.\"\n\n\"I couldn't do anything else,\" George said. \"We can't plead illness as\nI'd hoped to do. This afternoon the panel decided on a last minute\nindependent medical check to be sure you're OK. That means I can't fake\nit and there's no time to give you a cold or some mild illness now.\nSomehow I've got to stall past the fertile period and then we will have\nanother month to think of something.\"\n\n\"How long is the fertile period?\"\n\n\"Our tests show that in your case it is approximately twenty-four hours\nand begins about midnight tonight.\"\n\n\"Couldn't I disappear for a day or pretend I'm frightened of having a\nbaby and call it off? Goodness knows we're both getting frightened right\nnow.\" She poured out two stiff drinks.\n\n\"You can't just quit, Gloria. The whole nation has been whipped up into\nhysteria over this business, both by the politicians in their\nanticommunist speeches and by the sponsors on Coloraudio system. I never\ndreamed it could put a whole country into orbit ... but it has. We'll\nboth be ruined if I can't figure a way out that doesn't anger the\npublic.\" He drained his glass and began pacing again.\n\n\"If I have to go on with it can't you at least do something to prevent\nconception?\" Gloria asked. \"I don't mean vaccination. I want to have\nchildren later. I can stand the ceremony if I know I won't become\npregnant.\"\n\n\"In that case I could give you a shot of antiserum against sperm,\"\nGeorge said. \"That would stop pregnancy all right.\"\n\n\"Would it make me sterile for long?\"\n\n\"Oh no ... no! I wouldn't use pooled serum from all types anyway. You\nsee we make some specific serum when we are testing each donor and it\nworks only against the sperm of that particular man.\"\n\n\"Then we're all right? All I need is a shot?\"\n\nGeorge shook his head. \"I'm afraid to risk it, Gloria. They'll probably\nexamine your blood tomorrow. If they found the specific antibody, or\neven a general antisperm antibody, that would really get us into trouble\nfor fraud.\" He shook his head. \"No. I'm afraid that's not the answer. I\ndon't know what to do.\" He poured another drink and downed it.\n\n\"George,\" Gloria wailed, her control breaking at last, \"I don't want a\ntest-tube husband, a parent by proxy. I want a man!\" She began to cry.\n\nHe came over to the couch and dropped down beside her. \"Darling, please!\nPlease don't cry. There must be a way to beat this.\" He took her in his\narms.\n\n\n\nThe aircar warning light came on and the buzzer sounded. George unhooked\nthe automatic pilot and took over. They swung into University City and\nacross the campus to the Faculty residential area.\n\n\"I certainly was lucky to find a job here on retirement from the Space\nForce,\" John Harmon said. \"It was good of you to invite me to stay the\nweek-end. Are you sure Mrs. Turner won't mind?\"\n\n\"Quite sure.\" George smiled. \"She's been looking forward to meeting\nyou.\" He pulled the car into a spacious port and opened the front door\nof the house for Harmon. A tall, good-looking brunette moved to meet\nthem.\n\n\"So nice to meet you, Mrs. ...\" Harmon began automatically. \"Great\nmountains of the moon! Gloria ... Gloria Manson!\" He turned to George.\n\"You didn't tell me.\"\n\n\"You mean you didn't know?\" Gloria asked, and kissed him affectionately.\n\n\"I found out that he didn't. He was back in space at the time we were\nmarried.\" George said. \"I wanted to surprise him.\" A happy smile\ncreased his face.\n\nHarmon stared at him. \"Oh no!\" he said and began to laugh. They watched\nhim, astonished. He tried to talk. \"George ... ha, ha ... Wonderful!\" He\nconvulsed again, struggled to a chair and collapsed. \"The boy ...\" he\nwhispered weakly between great whoops.\n\n\"The boy? Then you guessed!\" The wide smile split George's face again.\n\n\"Yes, that smile ... couldn't miss it. But how?\" Harmon had recovered.\nThey went into the living room and sat down to talk.\n\n\"So there we were,\" George concluded, \"tanking up on lox and nothing\ncoming out but smoke. I was getting a bit woozy when Gloria asked me\nwhat time it was.\n\n\"I looked at my watch. 'It's midnight,' I said. That did it.\n\n\"'Midnight!' she screeched and gave me the green-eyed tiger look. 'Well,\nGeorge Turner, maybe you can't think of something ... but I can!'\n\n\"About nine in the morning the secretary of the panel called my room at\nthe hotel. 'The ceremony is at ten, Doctor!' she said. 'We are waiting\nfor you.'\n\n\"Man, what a head I had! You could have pushed the Destruct button and\nI'd never have known. Anyway I got to the hospital and there was\nGloria, looking absolutely beautiful. There were press photographers\neverywhere. We went through with the ceremony and that was that. Nine\nmonths later, with a lot of sonic booming, Boy America was born. You saw\nhim today.\"\n\n\"But he looks like you,\" John protested.\n\n\"He should,\" Gloria said. \"He's his.\"\n\n\"But ...\" John hesitated. \"I don't want to pry, but how can you be\nsure?\"\n\nGloria laughed. \"Well, I know what we did the first couple of hours\nafter midnight. You tell him the rest, George.\"\n\n\"There isn't much else to tell,\" George said. \"After the ceremony I gave\nher a shot of the specific antiserum as soon as I could get her alone.\nLater the committee examined her blood. They found she was pregnant so\nnobody even thought of testing for antisperm bodies. Then the boy was\nborn. Naturally I was a bit concerned. I took blood samples and did\ngenetic studies. There was no doubt. He was my son.\"\n\n\"And nobody ever suspected?\" Harmon asked.\n\n\"No,\" Turner said. \"The law prescribes examination before pregnancy but\nnot afterwards. We were married three months later and everybody was\nvery happy. As for the boy looking like me, everyone who has noticed it\nassumes I picked a donor like myself.
