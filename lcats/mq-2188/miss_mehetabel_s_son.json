THE OLD TAVERN AT BAYLEY'S FOUR CORNERS.\n\nYou will not find Greenton, or Bayley's Four-Corners, as it is more\nusually designated, on any map of New England that I know of. It is\nnot a town; it is not even a village; it is merely an absurd hotel. The\nalmost indescribable place called Greenton is at the intersection of\nfour roads, in the heart of New Hampshire, twenty miles from the nearest\nsettlement of note, and ten miles from any railway station. A good\nlocation for a hotel, you will say. Precisely; but there has always\nbeen a hotel there, and for the last dozen years it has been pretty well\npatronized--by one boarder. Not to trifle with an intelligent public, I\nwill state at once that, in the early part of this century, Greenton was\na point at which the mail-coach on the Great Northern Route stopped to\nchange horses and allow the passengers to dine. People in the county,\nwishing to take the early mail Portsmouth-ward, put up overnight at the\nold tavern, famous for its irreproachable larder and soft feather-beds.\nThe tavern at that time was kept by Jonathan Bayley, who rivalled his\nwallet in growing corpulent, and in due time passed away. At his death\nthe establishment, which included a farm, fell into the hands of a\nson-in-law. Now, though Bayley left his son-in-law a hotel--which sounds\nhandsome--he left him no guests; for at about the period of the old\nman's death the old stage-coach died also. Apoplexy carried off one, and\nsteam the other. Thus, by a sudden swerve in the tide of progress,\nthe tavern at the Corners found itself high and dry, like a wreck on a\nsand-bank. Shortly after this event, or maybe contemporaneously, there\nwas some attempt to build a town at Green-ton; but it apparently failed,\nif eleven cellars choked up with _debris_ and overgrown with burdocks\nare any indication of failure. The farm, however, was a good farm, as\nthings go in New Hampshire, and Tobias Sewell, the son-in-law, could\nafford to snap his fingers at the travelling public if they came near\nenough--which they never did.\n\nThe hotel remains to-day pretty much the same as when Jonathan Bayley\nhanded in his accounts in 1840, except that Sewell hasfrom time to time\nsold the furniture of some of the upper chambers to bridal couples\nin the neighborhood. The bar is still open, and the parlor door says\nParlour in tall black letters. Now and then a passing drover looks in at\nthat lonely bar-room, where a high-shouldered bottle of Santa Cruz rum\nogles with a peculiarly knowing air a shrivelled lemon on a shelf; now\nand then a farmer rides across country to talk crops and stock and take\na friendly glass with Tobias; and now and then a circus caravan with\nspeckled ponies, or a menagerie with a soggy elephant, halts under the\nswinging sign, on which there is a dim mail-coach with four phantomish\nhorses driven by a portly gentleman whose head has been washed off\nby the rain. Other customers there are none, except that one regular\nboarder whom have mentioned.\n\nIf misery makes a man acquainted with strange bed-fellows, it is equally\ncertain that the profession of surveyor and civil engineer often takes\none into undreamed-of localities. I had never heard of Greenton until\nmy duties sent me there, and kept me there two weeks in the dreariest\nseason of the year. I do not think I would, of my own volition, have\nselected Greenton for a fortnight's sojourn at any time; but now the\nbusiness is over, I shall never regret the circumstances that made me\nthe guest of Tobias Sewell, and brought me into intimate relations with\nMiss Mehetabel's Son.\n\nIt was a black October night in the year of grace 1872, that discovered\nme standing in front of the old tavern at the Corners.\n\nThough the ten miles' ride from K------ had been depressing, especially\nthe last five miles, on account of the cold autumnal rain that had set\nin, I felt a pang of regret on hearing the rickety open wagon turn round\nin the road and roll off in the darkness. There were no lights visible\nanywhere, and only for the big, shapeless mass of something in front of\nme, which the driver had said was the hotel, I should have fancied that\nI had been set down by the roadside. I was wet to the skin and in no\namiable humor; and not being able to find bell-pull or knocker, or even\na door, I belabored the side of the house with my heavy walking-stick.\nIn a minute or two I saw a light flickering somewhere aloft, then I\nheard the sound of a window opening, followed by an exclamation of\ndisgust as a blast of wind extinguished the candle which had given me\nan instantaneous picture _en silhouette_ of a man leaning out of a\ncasement.\n\n\"I say, what do you want, down there?\" inquired an unprepossessing\nvoice.\n\n\"I want to come in; I want a supper, and a bed, and numberless things.\"\n\n\"This is n't no time of night to go rousing honest folks out of their\nsleep. Who are you, anyway?\"\n\nThe question, superficially considered, was a very simple one, and I, of\nall people in the world, ought to have been able to answer it off-hand;\nbut it staggered me. Strangely enough, there came drifting across my\nmemory the lettering on the back of a metaphysical work which I had\nseen years before on a shelf in the Astor Library. Owing to an\nunpremeditatedly funny collocation of title and author, the lettering\nread as follows: \"Who am I? Jones.\" Evidently it had puzzled Jones to\nknow who he was, or he would n't have written a book about it, and come\nto so lame and impotent a conclusion. It certainly puzzled me at that\ninstant to define my identity. \"Thirty years ago,\" I reflected, \"I was\nnothing; fifty years hence I shall be nothing again, humanly speaking.\nIn the mean time, who am I, sure-enough?\" It had never before occurred\nto me what an indefinite article I was. I wish it had not occurred to\nme then. Standing there in the rain and darkness, I wrestled vainly with\nthe problem, and was constrained to fall back upon a Yankee expedient.\n\n\"Isn't this a hotel?\" I asked finally,\n\n\"Well, it is a sort of hotel,\" said the voice, doubtfully. My hesitation\nand prevarication had apparently not inspired my interlocutor with\nconfidence in me.\n\n\"Then let me in. I have just driven over from K------ in this infernal\nrain. I am wet through and through.\"\n\n\"But what do you want here, at the Corners? What's your business? People\ndon't come here, leastways in the middle of the night.\"\n\n\"It is n't in the middle of the night,\" I returned, incensed. \"I come\non business connected with the new road. I 'm the superintendent of the\nworks.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"And if you don't open the door at once, I'll raise the whole\nneighborhood--and then go to the other hotel.\"\n\nWhen I said that, I supposed Greenton was a village with a population of\nat least three or four thousand and was wondering vaguely at the absence\nof lights and other signs of human habitation. Surely, I thought, all\nthe people cannot be abed and asleep at half past ten o'clock: perhaps I\nam in the business section of the town, among the shops.\n\n\"You jest wait,\" said the voice above.\n\nThis request was not devoid of a certain accent of menace, and I braced\nmyself for a sortie on the part of the besieged, if he had any such\nhostile intent. Presently a door opened at the very place where I least\nexpected a door, at the farther end of the building, in fact, and a man\nin his shirtsleeves, shielding a candle with his left hand, appeared on\nthe threshold. I passed quickly into the house, with Mr. Tobias Sewell\n(for this was Mr. Sewell) at my heels, and found myself in a long,\nlow-studded bar-room.\n\nThere were two chairs drawn up before the hearth, on which a huge\nhemlock backlog was still smouldering, and on the un-painted deal\ncounter contiguous stood two cloudy glasses with bits of lemon-peel in\nthe bottom, hinting at recent libations. Against the discolored wall\nover the bar hung a yellowed handbill, in a warped frame, announcing\nthat \"the Next Annual N. H. Agricultural Fair\" would take place on the\n10th of September, 1841. There was no other furniture or decoration in\nthis dismal apartment, except the cobwebs which festooned the ceiling,\nhanging down here and there like stalactites.\n\nMr. Sewell set the candlestick on the mantel-shelf, and threw some\npine-knots on the fire, which immediately broke into a blaze, and\nshowed him to be a lank, narrow-chested man, past sixty, with sparse,\nsteel-gray hair, and small, deep-set eyes, perfectly round, like a\nfish's, and of no particular color. His chief personal characteristics\nseemed to be too much feet and not enough teeth. His sharply cut,\nbut rather simple face, as he turned it towards me, wore a look\nof interrogation. I replied to his mute inquiry by taking out my\npocket-book and handing him my business-card, which he held up to the\ncandle and perused with great deliberation.\n\n\"You 're a civil engineer, are you?\" he said, displaying his gums, which\ngave his countenance an expression of almost infantile innocence.\nHe made no further audible remark, but mumbled between his thin lips\nsomething which an imaginative person might have construed into \"If you\n're at civil engineer, I 'll be blessed if I would n't like to see an\nuncivil one!\"\n\nMr. Sewell's growl, however, was worse than his bite--owing to his\nlack of teeth probably--for he very good-naturedly set himself to work\npreparing supper for me. After a slice of cold ham, and a warm punch,\nto which my chilled condition gave a grateful flavor, I went to bed in a\ndistant chamber in a most amiable mood, feeling satisfied that Jones was\na donkey to bother himself about his identity.\n\nWhen I awoke, the sun was several hours high. My bed faced a window, and\nby raising myself on one elbow I could look out on what I expected would\nbe the main street. To my astonishment I beheld a lonely country\nroad winding up a sterile hill and disappearing over the ridge. In\na cornfield at the right of the road was a small private graveyard,\nenclosed by a crumbling stonewall with a red gate. The only thing\nsuggestive of life was this little corner lot occupied by death. I got\nout of bed and went to the other window. There I had an uninterrupted\nview of twelve miles of open landscape, with Mount Agamenticus in the\npurple distance. Not a house or a spire in sight. \"Well,\" I exclaimed,\n\"Greenton does n't appear to be a very closely packed metropolis!\" That\nrival hotel with which I had threatened Mr. Sewell overnight was not a\ndeadly weapon, looking at it by daylight. \"By Jove!\" I reflected, \"maybe\nI 'm in the wrong place.\" But there, tacked against a panel of the\nbedroom door, was a faded time-table dated Greenton, August 1, 1839.\n\nI smiled all the time I was dressing, and went smiling down stairs,\nwhere I found Mr. Sewell, assisted by one of the fair sex in the\nfirst bloom of her eightieth year, serving breakfast for me on a small\ntable--in the bar-room!\n\n\"I overslept myself this morning,\" I remarked apologetically, \"and I see\nthat I am putting you to some trouble. In future, if you will have me\ncalled, I will take my meals at the usual _table de hote_.\"\n\n\"At the what?\" said Mr. Sewell.\n\n\"I mean with the other boarders.\"\n\nMr. Sewell paused in the act of lifting a chop from the fire, and,\nresting the point of his fork against the woodwork of the mantelpiece,\ngrinned from ear to ear.\n\n\"Bless you! there is n't any other boarders. There has n't been anybody\nput up here sence--let me see--sence father-in-law died, and that was in\nthe fall of '40. To be sure, there 's Silas; _he_'s a regular boarder;\nbut I don't count him.\"\n\nMr. Sewell then explained how the tavern had lost its custom when the\nold stage line was broken up by the railroad. The introduction of steam\nwas, in Mr. Sewell's estimation, a fatal error. \"Jest killed local\nbusiness. Carried it off, I 'm darned if I know where. The whole country\nhas been sort o' retrograding ever sence steam was invented.\"\n\n\"You spoke of having one boarder,\" I said.\n\n\"Silas? Yes; he come here the summer 'Tilda died--she that was 'Tilda\nBayley--and he 's here yet, going on thirteen year. He could n't live\nany longer with the old man. Between you and I, old Clem Jaffrey,\nSilas's father, was a hard nut. Yes,\" said Mr. Sewell, crooking his\nelbow in inimitable pantomime, \"altogether too often. Found dead in the\nroad hugging a three-gallon demijohn. _Habeas corpus_ in the barn,\"\nadded Mr. Sewell, intending, I presume, to intimate that a _post-mortem_\nexamination had been deemed necessary. \"Silas,\" he resumed, in that\nrespectful tone which one should always adopt when speaking of capital,\n\"is a man of considerable property; lives on his interest, and keeps a\nhoss and shay. He 's a great scholar, too, Silas; takes all the\npe-ri-odicals and the Police Gazette regular.\"\n\nMr. Sewell was turning over a third chop, when the door opened and a\nstoutish, middle-aged little gentleman, clad in deep black, stepped into\nthe room.\n\n\"Silas Jaffrey,\" said Mr. Sewell, with a comprehensive sweep of his\narm, picking up me and the new-comer on one fork, so to speak. \"Be\nacquainted!\"\n\nMr. Jaffrey advanced briskly, and gave me his hand with unlooked-for\ncordiality. He was a dapper little man, with a head as round and nearly\nas bald as an orange, and not unlike an orange in complexion, either;\nhe had twinkling gray eyes and a pronounced Roman nose, the numerous\nfreckles upon which were deepened by his funereal dress-coat and\ntrousers. He reminded me of Alfred de Musset's blackbird, which, with\nits yellow beak and sombre plumage, looked like an undertaker eating an\nomelet.\n\n\"Silas will take care of you,\" said Mr. Sewell, taking down his hat from\na peg behind the door. \"I 've got the cattle to look after. Tell him, if\nyou want anything.\"\n\nWhile I ate my breakfast, Mr. Jaffrey hopped up and down the narrow\nbar-room and chirped away as blithely as a bird on a cherry-bough,\noccasionally ruffling with his fingers a slight fringe of auburn hair\nwhich stood up pertly round his head and seemed to possess a luminous\nquality of its own.\n\n\"Don't I find it a little slow up here at the Corners? Not at all, my\ndear sir. I am in the thick of life up here. So many interesting things\ngoing on all over the world--inventions, discoveries, spirits, railroad\ndisasters, mysterious homicides. Poets, murderers, musicians, statesmen,\ndistinguished travellers, prodigies of all kinds turning up everywhere.\nVery few events or persons escape me. I take six daily city papers,\nthirteen weekly journals, all the monthly magazines, and two\nquarterlies. I could not get along with less. I could n't if you asked\nme. I never feel lonely. How can I, being on intimate terms, as it were,\nwith thousands and thousands of people? There's that young woman out\nWest. What an entertaining creature _she_ is!--now in Missouri, now\nin Indiana, and now in Minnesota, always on the go, and all the time\nshedding needles from various parts of her body as if she really enjoyed\nit! Then there 's that versatile patriarch who walks hundreds of miles\nand saws thousands of feet of wood, before breakfast, and shows no signs\nof giving out. Then there's that remarkable, one may say that historical\ncolored woman who knew Benjamin Franklin, and fought at the battle of\nBunk--no, it is the old negro man who fought at Bunker Hill, a mere\ninfant, of course, at that period. Really, now, it is quite curious\nto observe how that venerable female slave--formerly an African\nprincess--is repeatedly dying in her hundred and eleventh year, and\ncoming to life again punctually every six months in the small-type\nparagraphs. Are you aware, sir, that within the last twelve years no\nfewer than two hundred and eighty-seven of General Washington's colored\ncoachmen have died?\"\n\nFor the soul of me I could not tell whether this quaint little gentleman\nwas chaffing me or not. I laid down my knife and fork, and stared at\nhim.\n\n\"Then there are the mathematicians!\" he cried vivaciously, without\nwaiting for a reply. \"I take great interest in them. Hear this!\" and Mr.\nJaffrey drew a newspaper from a pocket in the tail of his coat, and read\nas follows: \"_It has been estimated that if all the candles manufactured\nby this eminent firm (Stearine & Co.) were placed end to end, they\nwould reach 2 and 7/8 times around the globe_. Of course,\" continued Mr.\nJaffrey, folding up the journal reflectively, \"abstruse calculations of\nthis kind are not, perhaps, of vital importance, but they indicate the\nintellectual activity of the age. Seriously, now,\" he said, halting in\nfront of the table, \"what with books and papers and drives about the\ncountry, I do not find the days too long, though I seldom see any one,\nexcept when I go over to K------ for my mail. Existence may be very full\nto a man who stands a little aside from the tumult and watches it with\nphilosophic eye. Possibly he may see more of the battle than those who\nare in the midst of the action. Once I was struggling with the crowd, as\neager and undaunted as the best; perhaps I should have been struggling\nstill. Indeed, I know my life would have been very different now if I\nhad married Mehetabel--if I had married Mehetabel.\"\n\nHis vivacity was gone, a sudden cloud had come over his bright face, his\nfigure seemed to have collapsed, the light seemed to have faded out\nof his hair. With a shuffling step, the very antithesis of his brisk,\nelastic tread, he turned to the door and passed into the road.\n\n\"Well,\" I said to myself, \"if Greenton had forty thousand inhabitants,\nit could n't turn out a more astonishing old party than that!\"\n\n\n\n\nII. THE CASE OF SILAS JAFFREY.\n\nA man with a passion for _bric-a-brac_ is always stumbling over antique\nbronzes, intaglios, mosaics, and daggers of the time of Benvenuto\nCellini; the bibliophile finds creamy vellum folios and rare Alduses and\nElzevirs waiting for him at unsuspected bookstalls; the numismatist has\nbut to stretch forth his palm to have priceless coins drop into it. My\nown weakness is odd people, and I am constantly encountering them.\nIt was plain that I had unearthed a couple of very queer specimens at\nBayley's Four-Corners. I saw that a fortnight afforded me too brief an\nopportunity to develop the richness of both, and I resolved to devote\nmy spare time to Mr. Jaffrey alone, instinctively recognizing in him\nan unfamiliar species. My professional work in the vicinity of Greenton\nleft my evenings and occasionally an afternoon unoccupied; these\nintervals I purposed to employ in studying and classifying my\nfellow-boarder. It was necessary, as a preliminary step, to learn\nsomething of his previous history, and to this end I addressed myself to\nMr. Sewell that same night.\n\n\"I do not want to seem inquisitive,\" I said to the landlord, as he was\nfastening up the bar, which, by the way, was the _salle a manger_ and\ngeneral sitting-room--\"I do not want to seem inquisitive, but\nyour friend Mr. Jaffrey dropped a remark this morning at breakfast\nwhich--which was not altogether clear to me.\"\n\n\"About Mehetabel?\" asked Mr. Sewell, uneasily.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, I wish he would n't!\"\n\n\"He was friendly enough in the course of conversation to hint to me that\nhe had not married the young woman, and seemed to regret it.\"\n\n\"No, he did n't marry Mehetabel.\"\n\n\"May I inquire _why_ he did n't marry Mehetabel?\"\n\n\"Never asked her. Might have married the girl forty times. Old Elkins's\ndaughter, over at K------. She 'd have had him quick enough. Seven\nyears, off and on, he kept company with Mehetabel, and then she died.\"\n\n\"And he never asked her?\"\n\n\"He shilly-shallied. Perhaps he did n't think of it. When she was dead\nand gone, then Silas was struck all of a heap--and that's all about it.\"\n\nObviously Mr. Sewell did not intend to tell me anything more, and\nobviously there was more to tell. The topic was plainly disagreeable to\nhim for some reason or other, and that unknown reason of course piqued\nmy curiosity.\n\nAs I was absent from dinner and supper that day, I did not meet Mr.\nJaffrey again until the following morning at breakfast. He had recovered\nhis bird-like manner, and was full of a mysterious assassination that\nhad just taken place in New York, all the thrilling details of which\nwere at his fingers' ends. It was at once comical and sad to see this\nharmless old gentleman with his naive, benevolent countenance, and his\nthin hair flaming up in a semicircle, like the footlights at a theatre,\nrevelling in the intricacies of the unmentionable deed.\n\n\"You come up to my room to-night,\" he cried, with horrid glee, \"and I\n'll give you my theory of the murder. I 'll make it as clear as day to\nyou that it was the detective himself who fired the three pistol-shots.\"\n\nIt was not so much the desire to have this point elucidated as to make\na closer study of Mr. Jaffrey that led me to accept his invitation.\nMr. Jaffrey's bedroom was in an L of the building, and was in no way\nnoticeable except for the numerous files of newspapers neatly arranged\nagainst the blank spaces of the walls, and a huge pile of old magazines\nwhich stood in one corner, reaching nearly up to the ceiling, and\nthreatening to topple over each instant, like the Leaning Tower at Pisa.\nThere were green paper shades at the windows, some faded chintz valances\nabout the bed, and two or three easy-chairs covered with chintz. On\na black-walnut shelf between the windows lay a choice collection of\nmeerschaum and brier-wood pipes.\n\nFilling one of the chocolate-colored bowls for me and another for\nhimself, Mr. Jaffrey began prattling; but not about the murder, which\nappeared to have flown out of his mind. In fact, I do not remember that\nthe topic was even touched upon, either then or afterwards.\n\n\"Cosey nest this,\" said Mr. Jaffrey, glancing complacently over the\napartment. \"What is more cheerful, now, in the fall of the year, than an\nopen wood-fire? Do you hear those little chirps and twitters coming\nout of that piece of apple-wood? Those are the ghosts of the robins and\nbluebirds that sang upon the bough when it was in blossom last spring.\nIn summer whole flocks of them come fluttering about the fruit-trees\nunder the window: so I have singing birds all the year round. I take\nit very easy here, I can tell you, summer and winter. Not much society.\nTobias is not, perhaps, what one would term a great intellectual force,\nbut he means well. He 's a realist--believes in coming down to what he\ncalls 'the hard pan;' but his heart is in the right place, and he 's\nvery kind to me. The wisest thing I ever did in my life was to sell out\nmy grain business over at K------, thirteen years ago, and settle down\nat the Corners. When a man has made a competency, what does he want\nmore? Besides, at that time an event occurred which destroyed any\nambition I may have had. Mehetabel died.\" \"The lady you were engaged\nto?\" \"N-o, not precisely engaged. I think it was quite understood\nbetween us, though nothing had been said on the subject. Typhoid,\" added\nMr. Jaffrey, in a low voice.\n\nFor several minutes he smoked in silence, a vague, troubled look playing\nover his countenance. Presently this passed away, and he fixed his gray\neyes speculatively upon my face.\n\n\"If I had married Mehetabel,\" said Mr. Jaffrey, slowly, and then he\nhesitated. I blew a ring of smoke into the air, and, resting my pipe\non my knee, dropped into an attitude of attention. \"If I had married\nMehetabel, you know, we should have had--ahem!--a family.\"\n\n\"Very likely,\" I assented, vastly amused at this unexpected turn.\n\n\"A Boy!\" exclaimed Mr. Jaffrey, explosively.\n\n\"By all means, certainly, a son.\"\n\n\"Great trouble about naming the boy. Mehetabel's family want him named\nElkanah Elkins, after her grandfather; I want him named Andrew Jackson.\nWe compromise by christening him Elkanah Elkins Andrew Jackson Jaffrey.\nRather a long name for such a short little fellow,\" said Mr. Jaffrey,\nmusingly.\n\n\"Andy is n't a bad nickname,\" I suggested.\n\n\"Not at all. We call him Andy, in the family. Somewhat fractious at\nfirst--colic and things. I suppose it is right, or it would n't be so;\nbut the usefulness of measles, mumps, croup, whooping-cough, scarlatina,\nand fits is not clear to the parental eye. I wish Andy would be a model\ninfant, and dodge the whole lot.\"\n\nThis supposititious child, born within the last few minutes, was plainly\nassuming the proportions of a reality to Mr. Jaffrey. I began to feel a\nlittle uncomfortable. I am, as I have said, a civil engineer, and it is\nnot strictly in my line to assist at the births of infants, imaginary or\notherwise. I pulled away vigorously at the pipe, and said nothing.\n\n\"What large blue eyes he has,\" resumed Mr. Jaffrey, after a pause;\n\"just like Hetty's; and the fair hair, too, like hers. How oddly certain\ndistinctive features are handed down in families! Sometimes a mouth,\nsometimes a turn of the eyebrow. Wicked little boys over at K------ have\nnow and then derisively advised me to follow my nose. It would be an\ninteresting thing to do. I should find my nose flying about the world,\nturning up unexpectedly here and there, dodging this branch of the\nfamily and re-appearing in that, now jumping over one greatgrandchild to\nfasten itself upon another, and never losing its individuality. Look\nat Andy. There 's Elkanah Elkins's chin to the life. Andy's chin is\nprobably older than the Pyramids. Poor little thing,\" he cried, with\nsudden indescribable tenderness, \"to lose his mother so early!\" And Mr.\nJaf-frey's head sunk upon his breast, and his shoulders slanted forward,\nas if he were actually bending over the cradle of the child. The whole\ngesture and attitude was so natural that it startled me. The pipe\nslipped from my fingers and fell to the floor.\n\n\"Hush!\" whispered Mr. Jaffrey, with a deprecating motion of his hand.\n\"Andy's asleep!\"\n\nHe rose softly from the chair and, walking across the room on tiptoe,\ndrew down the shade at the window through which the moonlight was\nstreaming. Then he returned to his seat, and remained gazing with\nhalf-closed eyes into the dropping embers.\n\nI refilled my pipe and smoked in profound silence, wondering what would\ncome next.\n\nBut nothing came next. Mr. Jaffrey had fallen into so brown a study\nthat, a quarter of an hour afterwards, when I wished him good-night and\nwithdrew, I do not think he noticed my departure.\n\nI am not what is called a man of imagination; it is my habit to exclude\nmost things not capable of mathematical demonstration; but I am not\nwithout a certain psychological insight, and I think I understood Mr.\nJaffrey's case. I could easily understand how a man with an unhealthy,\nsensitive nature, overwhelmed by sudden calamity, might take refuge in\nsome forlorn place like this old tavern, and dream his life away. To\nsuch a man--brooding forever on what might have been and dwelling wholly\nin the realm of his fancies--the actual world might indeed become as a\ndream, and nothing seem real but his illusions. I dare say that thirteen\nyears of Bayley's Four-Corners would have its effect upon me; though\ninstead of conjuring up golden-haired children of the Madonna, I should\nprobably see gnomes and kobolds, and goblins engaged in hoisting false\nsignals and misplacing switches for midnight express trains.\n\n\"No doubt,\" I said to myself that night, as I lay in bed, thinking over\nthe matter, \"this once possible but now impossible child is a great\ncomfort to the old gentleman--a greater comfort, perhaps, than a real\nson would be. Maybe Andy will vanish with the shades and mists of night,\nhe's such an unsubstantial infant; but if he does n't, and Mr. Jaffrey\nfinds pleasure in talking to me about his son, I shall humor the old\nfellow. It would n't be a Christian act to knock over his harmless\nfancy.\"\n\nI was very impatient to see if Mr. Jaffrey's illusion would stand the\ntest of daylight. It did. Elkanah Elkins Andrew Jackson Jaffrey was, so\nto speak, alive and kicking the next morning. On taking his seat at\nthe breakfast-table, Mr. Jaffrey whispered to me that Andy had had a\ncomfortable night.\n\n\"Silas!\" said Mr. Sewell, sharply, \"what are you whispering about?\"\n\nMr. Sewell was in an ill-humor; perhaps he was jealous because I had\npassed the evening in Mr. Jaffrey's room; but surely Mr. Sewell could\nnot expect his boarders to go to bed at eight o'clock every night, as he\ndid. From time to time during the meal Mr. Sewell regarded me unkindly\nout of the corner of his eye, and in helping me to the parsnips he\nponiarded them with quite a suggestive air. All this, however, did not\nprevent me from repairing to the door of Mr. Jaffrey's snuggery when\nnight came.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Jaffrey, how 's Andy this evening?\"\n\n\"Got a tooth!\" cried Mr. Jaffrey, vivaciously.\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Yes, he has! Just through. Gave the nurse a silver dollar. Standing\nreward for first tooth.\"\n\nIt was on the tip of my tongue to express surprise that an infant a day\nold should cut a tooth, when I suddenly recollected that Richard III.\nwas born with teeth. Feeling myself to be on unfamiliar ground, I\nsuppressed my criticism. It was well I did so, for in the next breath I\nwas advised that half a year had elapsed since the previous evening.\n\n\"Andy 's had a hard six months of it,\" said Mr. Jaffrey, with the\nwell-known narrative air of fathers. \"We 've brought him up by hand. His\ngrandfather, by the way, was brought up by the bottle\"--and brought down\nby it, too, I added mentally, recalling Mr. Sewell's account of the old\ngentleman's tragic end.\n\nMr. Jaffrey then went on to give me a history of Andy's first six\nmonths, omitting no detail however insignificant or irrelevant. This\nhistory I would in turn inflict upon the reader, if I were only certain\nthat he is one of those dreadful parents who, under the aegis of\nfriendship, bore you at a streets corner with that remarkable thing\nwhich Freddy said the other day, and insist on singing to you, at an\nevening parly, the Iliad of Tommy's woes.\n\nBut to inflict this _enfantillage_ upon the unmarried reader would be\nan act of wanton cruelty. So I pass over that part of Andy's biography,\nand, for the same reason, make no record of the next four or five\ninterviews I had with Mr. Jaffrey. It will be sufficient to state\nthat Andy glided from extreme infancy to early youth with astonishing\ncelerity--at the rate of one year per night, if I remember correctly;\nand--must I confess it?--before the week came to an end, this invisible\nhobgoblin of a boy was only little less of a reality to me than to Mr.\nJaffrey.\n\nAt first I had lent myself to the old dreamer's whim with a keen\nperception of the humor of the thing; but by and by I found that I\nwas talking and thinking of Miss Mehetabel's son as though he were a\nveritable personage. Mr. Jafifrey spoke of the child with such an air of\nconviction!--as if Andy were playing among his toys in the next room, or\nmaking mud-pies down in the yard. In these conversations, it should be\nobserved, the child was never supposed to be present, except on that\nsingle occasion when Mr. Jafifrey leaned over the cradle. After one of\nour _seances_ I would lie awake until the small hours, thinking of the\nboy, and then fall asleep only to have indigestible dreams about him.\nThrough the day, and sometimes in the midst of complicated calculations,\nI would catch myself wondering what Andy was up to now! There was no\nshaking him off; he became an inseparable nightmare to me; and I felt\nthat if I remained much longer at Bayley's Four-Corners I should\nturn into just such another bald-headed, mild-eyed visionary as Silas\nJaffrey.\n\nThen the tavern was a grewsome old shell any way, full of unaccountable\nnoises after dark--rustlings of garments along unfrequented passages,\nand stealthy footfalls in unoccupied chambers overhead. I never knew of\nan old house without these mysterious noises. Next to my bedroom was a\nmusty, dismantled apartment, in one corner of which, leaning against the\nwainscot, was a crippled mangle, with its iron crank tilted in the air\nlike the elbow of the late Mr. Clem Jaffrey. Sometimes,\n\n     \"In the dead vast and middle of the night,\"\n\nI used to hear sounds as if some one were turning that rusty crank on\nthe sly. This occurred only on particularly cold nights, and I conceived\nthe uncomfortable idea that it was the thin family ghosts, from the\nneglected graveyard in the cornfield, keeping themselves warm by running\neach other through the mangle. There was a haunted air about the whole\nplace that made it easy for me to believe in the existence of a phantasm\nlike Miss Mehetabel's son, who, after all, was less unearthly than Mr.\nJaffrey himself, and seemed more properly an inhabitant of this globe\nthan the toothless ogre who kept the inn, not to mention the silent\nWitch of Endor that cooked our meals for us over the bar-room fire.\n\nIn spite of the scowls and winks bestowed upon me by Mr. Sewell, who let\nslip no opportunity to testify his disapprobation of the intimacy,\nMr. Jaffrey and I spent all our evenings together--those long autumnal\nevenings, through the length of which he talked about the boy, laying\nout his path in life and hedging the path with roses. He should be sent\nto the High School at Portsmouth, and then to college; he should be\neducated like a gentleman, Andy.\n\n\"When the old man dies,\" remarked Mr. Jaffrey one night, rubbing his\nhands gleefully, as if it were a great joke, \"Andy will find that the\nold man has left him a pretty plum.\"\n\n\"What do you think of having Andy enter West Point, when he 's old\nenough?\" said Mr. Jaffrey on another occasion. \"He need n't necessarily\ngo into the army when he graduates; he can become a civil engineer.\"\n\nThis was a stroke of flattery so delicate and indirect that I could\naccept it without immodesty.\n\nThere had lately sprung up on the corner of Mr. Jaffrey's bureau a small\ntin house, Gothic in architecture and pink in color, with a slit in the\nroof, and the word _Bank_ painted on one facade. Several times in the\ncourse of an evening Mr. Jaffrey would rise from his chair without\ninterrupting the conversation, and gravely drop a nickel into the\nscuttle of the bank. It was pleasant to observe the solemnity of his\ncountenance as he approached the edifice, and the air of triumph with\nwhich he resumed his seat by the fireplace. One night I missed the tin\nbank. It had disappeared, deposits and all, like a real bank. Evidently\nthere had been a defalcation on rather a large scale. I strongly\nsuspected that Mr. Sewell was at the bottom of it, but my suspicion\nwas not shared by Mr. Jaffrey, who, remarking my glance at the bureau,\nbecame suddenly depressed. \"I 'm afraid,\" he said, \"that I have failed\nto instil into Andrew those principles of integrity which--which\"--and\nthe old gentleman quite broke down.\n\nAndy was now eight or nine years old, and for some time past, if the\ntruth must be told, had given Mr. Jaffrey no inconsiderable trouble;\nwhat with his impishness and his illnesses, the boy led the pair of us\na lively dance. I shall not soon forget the anxiety of Mr. Jaffrey the\nnight Andy had the scarlet-fever--an anxiety which so infected me that\nI actually returned to the tavern the following afternoon earlier than\nusual, dreading to hear that the little spectre was dead, and greatly\nrelieved on meeting Mr. Jaffrey at the door-step with his face wreathed\nin smiles. When I spoke to him of Andy, I was made aware that I was\ninquiring into a case of scarlet-fever that had occurred the year\nbefore!\n\nIt was at this time, towards the end of my second week at Greenton,\nthat I noticed what was probably not a new trait--Mr. Jaffrey's curious\nsensitiveness to atmospherical changes. He was as sensitive as a\nbarometer. The approach of a storm sent his mercury down instantly. When\nthe weather was fair he was hopeful and sunny, and Andy's prospects\nwere brilliant. When the weather was overcast and threatening he grew\nrestless and despondent, and was afraid that the boy was not going to\nturn out well.\n\nOn the Saturday previous to my departure, which had been fixed for\nMonday, it rained heavily all the afternoon, and that night Mr. Jaffrey\nwas in an unusually excitable and unhappy frame of mind. His mercury was\nvery low indeed.\n\n\"That boy is going to the dogs just as fast as he can go,\" said Mr.\nJaffrey, with a woful face. \"I can't do anything with him.\"\n\n\"He'll come out all right, Mr. Jaffrey. Boys will be boys. I would not\ngive a snap for a lad without animal spirits.\"\n\n\"But animal spirits,\" said Mr. Jaffrey sententiously, \"should n't saw\noff the legs of the piano in Tobias's best parlor. I don't know what\nTobias will say when he finds it out.\"\n\n\"What! has Andy sawed off the legs of the old spinet?\" I returned,\nlaughing. \"Worse than that.\" \"Played upon it, then!\" \"No, sir. He has\nlied to me!\" \"I can't believe that of Andy.\" \"Lied to me, sir,\" repeated\nMr. Jaffrey, severely. \"He pledged me his word of honor that he would\ngive over his climbing. The way that boy climbs sends a chill down my\nspine. This morning, notwithstanding his solemn promise, he shinned\nup the lightning-rod attached to the extension, and sat astride the\nridge-pole. I saw him, and he denied it! When a boy you have caressed\nand indulged and lavished pocket-money on lies to you and _will_ climb,\nthen there's nothing more to be said. He's a lost child.\" \"You take too\ndark a view of it, Mr. Jaffrey. Training and education are bound to tell\nin the end, and he has been well brought up.\"\n\n\"But I did n't bring him up on a lightning-rod, did I? If he is ever\ngoing to know how to behave, he ought to know now. To-morrow he will be\neleven years old.\"\n\nThe reflection came to me that if Andy had not been brought up by the\nrod, he had certainly been brought up by the lightning. He was eleven\nyears old in two weeks!\n\nI essayed, with that perspicacious wisdom which seems to be the peculiar\nproperty of bachelors and elderly maiden ladies, to tranquillize Mr.\nJaffrey's mind, and to give him some practical hints on the management\nof youth.\n\n\"Spank him,\" I suggested at last.\n\n\"I will!\" said the old gentleman.\n\n\"And you 'd better do it at once!\" I added, as it flashed upon me that\nin six months Andy would be a hundred and forty-three years old!--an age\nat which parental discipline would have to be relaxed.\n\nThe next morning. Sunday, the rain came down as if determined to drive\nthe quicksilver entirely out of my poor friend. Mr. Jaffrey sat bolt\nupright at the breakfast-table, looking as woe-begone as a bust of\nDante, and retired to his chamber the moment the meal was finished. As\nthe day advanced, the wind veered round to the northeast, and settled\nitself down to work. It was not pleasant to think, and I tried not to\nthink, what Mr. Jaffrey's condition would be if the weather did not mend\nits manners by noon; but so far from clearing off at noon, the storm\nincreased in violence, and as night set in the wind whistled in a\nspiteful falsetto key, and the rain lashed the old tavern as if it\nwere a balky horse that refused to move on. The windows rattled in the\nworm-eaten frames, and the doors of remote rooms, where nobody ever\nwent, slammed to in the maddest way. Now and then the tornado, sweeping\ndown the side of Mount Agamenticus, bowled across the open country, and\nstruck the ancient hostelry point-blank.\n\nMr. Jaffrey did not appear at supper. I knew that he was expecting me to\ncome to his room as usual, and I turned over in my mind a dozen plans\nto evade seeing him that night. The landlord sat at the opposite side\nof the chimney-place, with his eye upon me. I fancy he was aware of the\neffect of this storm on his other boarder, for at intervals, as the wind\nhurled itself against the exposed gable, threatening to burst in the\nwindows, Mr. Sewell tipped me an atrocious wink, and displayed his gums\nin a way he had not done since the morning after my arrival at Greenton.\nI wondered if he suspected anything about Andy. There had been odd times\nduring the past week when I felt convinced that the existence of Miss\nMehetabel's son was no secret to Mr. Sewell.\n\nIn deference to the gale, the landlord sat up half an hour later than\nwas his custom. At half-past eight he went to bed, remarking that he\nthought the old pile would stand till morning.\n\nHe had been absent only a few minutes when I heard a rustling at the\ndoor. I looked up, and beheld Mr. Jaffrey standing on the threshold,\nwith his dress in disorder, his scant hair flying, and the wildest\nexpression on his face.\n\n\"He's gone!\" cried Mr. Jaffrey.\n\n\"Who? Sewell? Yes, he just went to bed.\"\n\n\"No, not Tobias--the boy!\"\n\n\"What, run away?\"\n\n\"No--he is dead! He has fallen from a step-ladder in the red chamber and\nbroken his neck!\"\n\nMr. Jaffrey threw up his hands with a gesture of despair, and\ndisappeared. I followed him through the hall, saw him go into his own\napartment, and heard the bolt of the door drawn to. Then I returned to\nthe bar-room, and sat for an hour or two in the ruddy glow of the fire,\nbrooding over the strange experience of the last fortnight.\n\nOn my way to bed I paused at Mr. Jaf-frey's door, and, in a lull of the\nstorm, the measured respiration within told me that the old gentleman\nwas sleeping peacefully.\n\nSlumber was coy with me that night. I lay listening to the soughing of\nthe wind, and thinking of Mr. Jaffrey's illusion. It had amused me at\nfirst with its grotesqueness; but now the poor little phantom was dead,\nI was conscious that there had been something pathetic in it all along.\nShortly after midnight the wind sunk down, coming and going fainter and\nfainter, floating around the eaves of the tavern with an undulating,\nmurmurous sound, as if it were turning itself into soft wings to bear\naway the spirit of a little child.\n\nPerhaps nothing that happened during my stay at Bayley's Four-Corners\ntook me so completely by surprise as Mr. Jaffrey's radiant countenance\nthe next morning. The morning itself was not fresher or sunnier. His\nround face literally shone with geniality and happiness. His eyes\ntwinkled like diamonds, and the magnetic light of his hair was turned\non full. He came into my room while I was packing my valise. He chirped,\nand prattled, and carolled, and was sorry I was going away--but never a\nword about Andy. However, the boy had probably been dead several years\nthen!\n\nThe open wagon that was to carry me to the station stood at the door;\nMr. Sewell was placing my case of instruments under the seat, and Mr.\nJaffrey had gone up to his room to get me a certain newspaper containing\nan account of a remarkable shipwreck on the Auckland Islands. I took the\nopportunity to thank Mr. Sewell for his courtesies to me, and to express\nmy regret at leaving him and Mr. Jaffrey.\n\n\"I have become very much attached to Mr. Jaffrey,\" I said; \"he is a most\ninteresting person; but that hypothetical boy of his, that son of Miss\nMehetabel's\"--\n\n\"Yes, I know!\" interrupted Mr. Sewell, testily. \"Fell off a step-ladder\nand broke his dratted neck. Eleven year old, was n't he? Always does,\njest at that point. Next week Silas will begin the whole thing over\nagain, if he can get anybody to listen to him.\"\n\n\"I see. Our amiable friend is a little queer on that subject.\"\n\nMr. Sewell glanced cautiously over his shoulder, and, tapping himself\nsignificantly on the forehead, said in a low voice,\n\n\"Room To Let--Unfurnished!\"",
