    "body": "Bertha and I were like a couple of city kids on their first country\nouting when we arrived at Morton's place. The weather was perfect--the\nfirst chill of autumn had arrived in the form of a fine, needle-shower\nrain of the type that doesn't look very bad through a window, but when\nyou get out in it, it seeks out every tiny opening between the warp\nand weft of your clothing and runs through your hair and eyebrows,\nunder your collar and over the surfaces of your body until, as though\ndirected by some knowing, invisible entity, it finds its way to your\nbelly-button.\n\nIt was beautifully timed: the ancient motor-bus had two blowouts on the\nway up the last half-mile of corduroy road that led to the place, and\nof course we were obliged to change the tires ourselves. This was a new\nexperience for both of us, and on the very first day! Everything was as\nadvertised, and we hadn't even arrived at the admission gate yet.\n\nWe didn't dare talk. On the way from the heliport we had seen some of\nthe other folks at work in the swamp that surrounded the camp proper.\nThey were digging out stumps with mattocks, crowbars and axes, and some\nof them stood waist-deep in the dark water. Bertha had said \"Looky\nthere!\" and had made some remark about the baggy gray coveralls they\nwore--\"Just like convicts,\" she said. The driver, a huge, swinelike\ncreature with very small, close-set eyes, had yanked the emergency\nbrake and wheeled around at us then.\n\n\"You shnooks might just as well get outa the habit o' talkin' right\nhere an' now. One more peep outa ya, 'n ya git clobbered!\"\n\nAll we could do was look at each other and giggle like a couple of kids\nin the back pew of Sunday School, after that. Bertha looked ten years\nyounger already.\n\nThe gate was exactly as the brochure had pictured it: solid and\nmassive, it was let into a board fence about ten feet high which\nextended as far as you could see in either direction and lost itself on\neither side in a tangle of briers, elder bushes and dark trees. There\nwere two strands of barbed wire running along the top. A sign over the\ngate--stark, black lettering on a light gray background--read:\n\n                    _Silence!--No admission without\n                        authority--No smoking!_\n\n                    *** _MORTON'S MISERY FARM_ ***\n\n                   _30 acres of swamp--Our own rock\n                   quarry--Jute Mill--Steam laundry\n\n                         Harshest dietary laws\n                           in the Catskills_\n\nA small door opened at one side of the gate and a short, stocky,\nwell-muscled woman in a black visored cap and a shapeless black uniform\ncame out and boarded the bus. She had our releases with her, fastened\nto a clipboard. She thrust this under my nose.\n\n\"Read and sign, shnook!\" she said in a voice that sounded like rusty\nboiler plate being torn away from more rusty boiler plate.\n\nThe releases were in order. Our hands shook a little when we signed\nthe papers; there was something so terribly final and irreversible\nabout it. There would be no release except in cases of severe medical\ncomplaint, external legal involvement or national emergency. We were\npaid up in advance, of course. There was no turning away.\n\nAnother attendant, who also looked like a matron of police, boarded the\nbus with a large suitcase and two of the baggy gray garments we had\nseen the others wearing in the swamp. No shoes, socks or underwear.\n\n\"Strip and pack your clothes here, shnooks,\" said the woman with the\nempty suitcase. We did, though it was pretty awkward ... standing there\nin the aisle of the bus with those two gorgons staring at us. I started\nto save out a pack of cigarettes, but was soon disabused of this idea.\nThe older of the two women knocked the pack from my hand, ground it\nunder her heel on the floor and let me have one across the face with\nwhat I am almost certain must have been an old sock full of rancid hog\nkidneys.\n\n\"What the hell was that?\" I protested.\n\n\"Sock fulla hog kidneys, shnook. Soft but heavy, know what I mean? Just\nlet us do the thinkin' around here. Git outa line just once an' you'll\nsee what we can do with a sock fulla hog kidneys.\"\n\nI didn't press the matter further. All I could think of was how I\nwanted a smoke just then. When I thought of the fresh, new pack of\ncigarettes with its unbroken cellophane and its twenty, pure white\ncylinders of fragrant Turkish and Virginia, I came as close to weeping\nas I had in forty years.\n\nThe ground was slimy and cold under our bare feet when we got down from\nthe bus, but the two viragos behind us gave us no time to pick our way\ndelicately over the uneven ground. We were propelled through the small\ndoor at the side of the gate, and at last we found ourselves within the\nten-foot barriers of the Misery Camp. We just looked at each other and\ngiggled.\n\nInside the yard, about twenty other guests shuffled around and around\nin a circle. Their gray coveralls were dark and heavy with the rain and\nclung to their bodies in clammy-looking patches. All moved sluggishly\nthrough the mud with their arms hanging slack at their sides, their\nshoulders hunched forward against the wet chill, and their eyes turned\ndownward, as though they were fascinated with the halting progress of\ntheir own feet. I had never seen people look so completely dispirited\nand tired. Only one man raised his head to look at us as we stood\nthere. I noticed that his forehead had bright purple marks on it. These\nproved to be \"_No. 94, Property of MMF_,\" in inch-high letters which\nran from temple to temple just above his eyebrows. Incredibly enough\nthe man grinned at us.\n\n\"You'll be sah-reeeee,\" he yelped. I saw him go down into the mud under\na blow with a kidney-sock from a burly male guard who had been standing\nin the center of the cheerless little circle.\n\n\"Leave the welcoming ceremonies to us, knoedelhead!\" barked the guard.\nThe improvident guest rose painfully and resumed his plodding with the\nrest. I noticed that he made no rejoinder. He cringed.\n\nWe were led into a small office at one end of a long, wooden, one-story\nbuilding. A sign on the door said, simply, \"_Admissions. Knock and\nRemove Hat._\" The lady guard knocked and we entered. We had no hats to\nremove; indeed, this was emphasized for us by the fact that the rain\nhad by now penetrated our hair and brows and was running down over our\nfaces annoyingly.\n\n\n\nAs soon as I'd blinked the rain from my eyes, I was able to see the\nform of the person behind the desk with more clarity than I might\nhave wished. He was large, but terribly emaciated, with the kind of\ngauntness that should be covered by a sheet--tenderly, reverently\nand finally. Picture the archetype of every chain-gang captain who\nhas been relieved for inhumanity to prisoners; imagine the naked\nattribute Meanness, stripped of all accidental, incongruous, mitigating\nintegument; picture all kindness, all mercy, all warmth, all humanity\nexcised or cauterized, or turned back upon itself and let ferment into\nsome kind of noxious mash; visualize the creature from which all the\ngentle qualities had been expunged, thus, and then try to forget the\nimage.\n\nThe eyes were perhaps the worst feature. They burned like tiny\nphosphorescent creatures, dimly visible deep inside a cave under dark,\noverhanging cliffs--the brows. The skin of the face was drawn over the\nbones so tautly that you felt a sharp rap with a hard object would\ncause the sharp cheekbones to break through. There was a darkness about\nthe skin that should have been, yet somehow did not seem to be the\nhealthy tan of outdoor living. It was a coloring that came from the\ninside and radiated outwards; perhaps pellagra--a wasting, darkening\nmalnutritional disease which no man had suffered for three hundred\nyears. I wondered where, where on the living earth, they had discovered\nsuch a specimen.\n\n\"I am in full charge here. You will speak only when spoken to,\" he\nsaid. His voice came as a surprise and, to me at least, as a profound\nrelief. I had expected an inarticulate drawl--something not yet\nlanguage, not quite human. Instead his voice was clipped, precise,\nclear as new type on white paper. This gave me hope at a time when hope\nwas at a dangerously low mark on my personal thermometer. My mounting\nmisgivings had come to focus on this grim figure behind the desk, and\nthe most feared quality that I had seen in the face, a hard, sharp,\nimmovable and imponderable stupidity, was strangely mitigated and even\ncontradicted by the flawless, mechanical speech of the man.\n\n\"What did you do on the Outside, shnook?\" he snapped at me.\n\n\"Central Computing and Control. I punched tapes. Only got four hours of\nwork a month,\" I said, hoping to cover myself with a protective film of\nhumility.\n\n\"Hah! Another low-hour man. I don't see how the hell you could afford\nto come here. Well, anyway--we've got work for climbers like you. Real\nwork, shnook. I know climbers like you hope you'll meet aristocracy\nin a place like this--ten hour men or even weekly workers, but I\ncan promise you, shnook, that you'll be too damned tired to disport\nyourself socially, and too damned busy looking at your toes. Don't\nforget that!\"\n\nRemembering, I looked down quickly, but not before one of the matrons\nbehind me had fetched me a solid clout on the side of the head with her\nsap.\n\n\"Mark 'em and put 'em to work,\" he barked at the guards. Two uniformed\nmen, who must have sneaked in while I was fascinated by the man behind\nthe desk, seized me and started painting my forehead with an acrid\nfluid that stung like strong disinfectant in an open wound. I squinted\nmy eyes and tried to look blank.\n\n\"This is indelible,\" one of them explained. \"We have the chemical to\ntake it off, but it doesn't come off till we say so.\"\n\nWhen I had been marked, one of the guards took his ink and brush and\nadvanced upon Bertha. The other addressed himself to me. \"There is a\nchoice of activities. There is the jute mill, the rock quarry, the\nstump-removal detail, the manure pile....\"\n\n\"How about the steam laundry?\" I asked, prompted now by the cold sound\nof a sudden gust of rain against the wooden side of the building.\n\n_Splukk!_ went the guard's kidney-sock as it landed on the right hinge\nof my jaw. Soft or not, it nearly dropped me.\n\n\"I said there _is_ a choice--not _you have_ a choice, shnook. Besides,\nthe steam laundry is for the ladies. Don't forget who's in charge here.\"\n\n\"Who _is_ in charge here, then?\" I asked, strangely emboldened by the\nclout on the side of the jaw.\n\n_Splukk!_ \"That's somethin' you don't need to know, shnook. You ain't\ngonna sue nobody. You signed a _release_--remember?\"\n\nI had nothing to say. My toes, I noted, looked much the same. Then,\nbehind my back, I heard a sharp squeal from Bertha. \"Stop that! Oh\nstop! Stop! The brochure said nothing about--\"\n\n\"Take it easy lady,\" said the other guard in an oily-nasty voice. \"I\nwon't touch you none. Just wanted to see if you was amenable.\"\n\nI would like more than anything else in the world to be able to say\nhonestly that I felt a surge of anger then. I didn't. I can remember\nwith terrible clarity that I felt nothing.\n\n\"So he wants a nice inside job in the steam laundry?\" said the man\nbehind the desk--\"the captain,\" we were instructed to call him. Another\ngust of wet wind joined his comments. \"Put him on 'The Big Rock Candy\nMountain.'\" He fixed me then with those deep-set, glow-worm eyes,\ncoldly appraising. The two Sisters of Gorgonia, meanwhile, seized\nBertha's arms and dragged her from the room. I did not try to follow. I\nknew the rules: there were to be three husband-and-wife visiting hours\nper week. Fifteen minutes each.\n\nThe Captain was still scrutinizing me from under the dark cliff of his\nbrow. A thin smile now took shape on his lipless mouth. One of the\nguards was beating a slow, measured, somewhat squudgy tattoo on the\nedge of the desk with his kidney-sock.\n\n\"You wouldn't be entertaining angry thoughts, would you shnook?\" asked\nthe Captain, after what seemed like half an hour of sickly pause.\n\nMy toes hadn't changed in the slightest respect.\n\n\n\nIt must have been then, or soon after that, that my sense of time went\ngently haywire. I was conducted to \"The Big Rock Candy Mountain,\" which\nturned out to be a Brobdingnagian manure heap. Its forbidding bulk\novershadowed all other features of the landscape except some of the\nlarger trees.\n\nA guard stood in the shadow of a large umbrella, at a respectable and\ntolerable distance from the nitrogenous colossus, but not so distant\nthat his voice did not command the entire scene. \"_Hut-ho! hut-ho!\nHut-ho HAW!_\" he roared, and the wretched, gray-clad figures, whose\nnumber I joined without ceremony or introduction, moved steadily at\ntheir endless work in apparent unawareness of his cadenced chant.\n\nI do not remember that anyone spoke to me directly or, at least,\ncoherently enough so that words lodged in my memory, but someone must\nhave explained the general pattern of activity. The object, it seemed,\nwas to move all this soggy fertilizer from its present imposing site\nto another small but growing pile located about three hundred yards\ndistant. This we were to accomplish by filling paper cement bags with\nthe manure and carrying it, a bag at a time, to the more distant pile.\nNeedless to say, the bags frequently dissolved or burst at the lower\nseams. This meant scraping up the stuff with the hands and refilling\nanother paper bag. Needless to say, also, pitchforks and shovels\nwere forbidden at the Farm, as was any potentially dangerous object\nwhich could be lifted, swung or hurled. It would have been altogether\nredundant to explain this rule.\n\nI have absolutely no way of knowing how long we labored at this Augean\nenterprise; my watch had been taken from me, of course, and of the\nstrange dislocation of my normal time-sense I have already spoken. I\ndo remember that floodlights had been turned on long before a raucous\nalarm sounded, indicating that it was time for supper.\n\nMy weariness from the unaccustomed toil had carried me past the\npoint of hunger, but I do remember my first meal at the Farm. We had\ndumplings. You usually think fondly of dumplings as being _in_ or\n_with_ something. We had just dumplings--cold and not quite cooked\nthrough.\n\nImpressions of this character have a way of entrenching themselves,\nperhaps at the cost of more meaningful ones. Conversation at the Farm\nwas monosyllabic and infrequent, so it may merely be that I recall\nmost lucidly those incidents with which some sort of communication was\nassociated. A small man sitting opposite me in the mess hall gloomily\nindicated the dumpling at which I was picking dubiously.\n\n\"They'll bind ya,\" he said with the finality of special and personal\nknowledge. \"Ya don't wanta let yaself get bound here. They've got a--\"\n\nI don't now recall whether I said something or whether I merely held up\nmy hand. I do know that I had no wish to dwell on the subject.\n\nIf I had hoped for respite after \"supper,\" it was at that time that I\nlearned not to hope. Back to \"The Big Rock Candy Mountain\" we went, and\nunder the bleak, iridescent glare of the lights we resumed our labor\nof no reward. One by one I felt my synapses parting, and one by one,\nslowly and certainly, the fragile membranes separating the minute from\nthe hour, the Now from the Then, and the epoch out of unmeasured time\nsoftened and sloughed away. I was, at last, Number 109 at work on a\nmonstrous manure pile, and I labored with the muscles and nerves of an\nundifferentiated man. I experienced change.\n\nI knew now that my identity, my ego, was an infinitesimal thing which\nrode along embedded in a mountain of more or less integrated organisms,\nmore or less purposeful tissues, fluids and loosely articulated bones,\nas a tiny child rides in the cab of a locomotive. And the rain came\ndown and the manure bags broke and we scrabbled with our hands to\nrefill new ones.\n\nThe raucous alarm sounded again, and a voice which might have been that\nof a hospital nurse or of an outraged parrot announced that it was time\nfor \"Beddy-by.\" And in a continuous, unbroken motion we slogged into\nanother long building, discarded our coveralls, waded through a shallow\ntank of cloudy disinfectant solution and were finally hosed down by\nthe guards. I remember observing to myself giddily that I now knew how\ncars must feel in an auto laundry. There were clean towels waiting for\nus at the far end of the long building, but I must have just blotted\nthe excess water off myself in a perfunctory way, because I still felt\nwet when I donned the clean coverall that someone handed me.\n\n\"Beddy-by\" was one of a row of thirty-odd slightly padded planks like\nironing boards, which were arranged at intervals of less than three\nfeet in another long, low-ceilinged barracks. I knew that I would find\nno real release in \"Beddy-by\"--only another dimension of that abiding\nstupor which now served me for consciousness. I may have groaned,\ncroaked, whimpered, or expressed myself in some other inarticulate way\nas I measured the length of the board with my carcass; I only remember\nthat the others did so. There was an unshaded light bulb hanging\ndirectly over my face. To this day, I cannot be sure that this bleak\nbeacon was ever turned off. I think not. I can only say with certainty\nthat it was burning just as brightly when the raucous signal sounded\nagain, and the unoiled voice from the loudspeaker announced that it was\ntime for the morning Cheer-Up Entertainment.\n\n\n\nThese orgies, it turned out, were held in the building housing\nthe admission office. There was a speech choir made up of elderly\nwomen, all of whom wore the black uniform of the Farm matrons. The\nrealization that a speech choir still existed may have startled me into\na somewhat higher state of awareness; I had assumed that the speech\nchoir had gone out with hair-receivers and humoristic medicine. The\nthings they recited were in a childishly simple verse form: _One and\ntwo and three and four; One and two and THREE._ These verses had to do\nwith the virtues of endless toil, the importance of thrift, and the\nhideous dangers lurking in cigarette smoking and needless borrowing.\n\nI am happy to report that I do not remember them more specifically\nthan this, but I was probably more impressed by the delivery than the\nmessage delivered. I could not imagine where they had discovered these\nwomen. During their performance, some sense of duration was restored to\nme; while I could be certain of nothing pertaining to the passage of\ntime, it is not possible that the Cheer-Up period lasted less than two\nhours. Then they let us go to the latrine.\n\nAfter a breakfast of boiled cabbage and dry pumpernickel crusts--more\nsavory than you might imagine--we were assigned to our work for the\nday. I had expected to return to the manure pile, but got instead the\nrock quarry. I remember observing then, with no surprise at all, that\nthe sun was out and the day promised to be a hot one.\n\nThe work at the rock quarry was organized according to the same\nfutilitarian pattern that governed the manure-pile operation. Rock\nhad to be hacked, pried and blasted from one end of the quarry, then\nreduced to coarse gravel with sledge-hammers and carted to the other\nend of the excavation in wheelbarrows. Most of the men commenced\nworking at some task in the quarry with the automatic unconcern of\ntrained beasts who have paused for rest and water, perhaps, but have\nnever fully stopped. A guard indicated a wheelbarrow to me and uttered\na sharp sound ... something like HUP! I picked up the smooth handles of\nthe barrow, and time turned its back upon us again.\n\nIt was that night--or perhaps the following night--that Bertha and I\nhad our first fifteen-minute visit with each other. She was changed:\nher face glowed with feverish vitality, her hair was stringy and moist,\nand her eyes were serenely glassy. She had not been more provocative\nin twenty-five years. An old dormant excitement stirred within\nme--microscopically but unmistakably.\n\nShe told me that she had been put to work in the jute mill, but had\npassed out and had been transferred to the steam laundry. Her job in\nthe laundry was to sort out the socks and underwear that were too bad\nto go in with the rest of the wash. We speculated on where the socks\nand underwear could have come from, as such fripperies were denied to\nus at the Farm. We also wondered about the manure, considering that\nno animals were in evidence here. Both, we concluded, must have been\nshipped in specially from the Outside. We found it in us to giggle,\nwhen the end of the visit was announced, over our own choice of\nconversational material for that precious quarter hour. Thereafter,\nwhen we could catch glimpses of each other during the day, we would\nexchange furtive signals, then go about our work exhilarated by the\nfiction that we shared some priceless Cabalistic knowledge.\n\nThe grim Captain made an appearance in the rock quarry one morning\njust as we were beginning work. He stood on top of a pile of stones,\nswinging his kidney-sap from his wrist and letting his eyes sweep over\nus as though selecting one for slaughter.\n\nWhen the silence had soaked in thoroughly, he announced in his cold,\nincisive tone that \"there will be no rest periods, no chow, no\n'Beddy-by,' until this entire rock face is reduced to ballast rock.\"\nHe indicated a towering slab of stone. We raised our heads only long\nenough to reassure ourselves of the utter hopelessness of the task\nbefore us. Not daring to look at each other closely, fearing to see our\nown despair reflected in the faces of others, we picked up our hammers\nand crowbars and crawled to the top of the monolithic mass. The film\nmust have cleared from my eyes then, momentarily.\n\n\"Why--this thing is nothing but a huge writing slate,\" I said to a\nsmall, bald inmate beside me. He made a feeble noise in reply. The\nCaptain left, and the only other guard now relaxed in the shade of a\nboulder nearly fifty yards away. He was smoking a forbidden cigar.\nSuddenly and unaccountably, I felt a little taller than the others,\nand everything looked unnaturally clear. The slab was less than six\ninches wide at the top!\n\n\"If we work this thing right, this job will practically do itself.\nWe'll be through here before sundown,\" I heard myself snap out. The\nothers, accustomed now to obeying any imperative voice, fell to with\ncrowbars and peaveys as I directed them. \"Use them as levers,\" I said.\n\"Don't just flail and hack--pry!\" No one questioned me. When all of the\ntools were in position I gave the count:\n\n\"_One--two--HEAVE!_\"\n\nThe huge slab finally leaned out, wavered for a queasy moment, then\nfell with a splintering crash onto the boulders below. After the dust\nsettled, we could see that much of the work of breaking up the mass was\nalready accomplished. We descended and set to work with an enthusiasm\nthat was new.\n\nLong before sundown, of course, we were marched back to the latrine\nand then to the mess hall. Later I had expected that some further work\nwould be thrust upon us, but it didn't happen. The grim Captain stopped\nme as I entered the mess hall. I froze. There was a queer smile on his\nface, and I had grown to fear novelty.\n\n\"You had a moment,\" he said, simply and declaratively. \"You didn't miss\nit, did you?\"\n\n\"No,\" I replied, not fully understanding. \"No, I didn't miss it.\"\n\n\"You are more fortunate than most,\" he went on, still standing between\nme and the mess hall. \"Some people come here year after year, or they\ngo to other places like this, or permit themselves to be confined\nin the hulls of old submarines, and some even apprentice themselves\nto medical missionaries in Equatorial Africa; they expose themselves\nto every conceivable combination of external conditions, but nothing\nreally happens to them. They feel nothing except a fleeting sensation\nof contrast--soon lost in a torrent of other sensations. No 'moment';\nonly a brief cessation of the continuing pleasure process. You have\nbeen one of the fortunate few, Mr. Devoe.\"\n\nThen the film dissolved--finally and completely--from the surface of\nmy brain, and my sense of time returned to me in a flood of ordered\nrecollections. Hours and days began to arrange themselves into\nmeaningful sequence. Was it possible that two whole glorious weeks\ncould have passed so swiftly?\n\n\"You and Mrs. Devoe may leave tonight or in the morning, just as you\nprefer,\" said the Captain.\n\n\n\nBertha and I have had little to say to one another as we wait in\nthe office for the car that will take us to the heliport. For the\nmoment--this moment--it suffices that we stand here in our own clothes,\nthat we have tasted coffee again, brought to us on a tray by a matron\nwhose manner towards us bordered on the obsequious, and that the aroma\nof a cigarette is just as gratifying as ever.\n\nWe will go back to our ten-room apartment on the ninety-first floor\nof the New Empire State Hotel; back to our swimming pool, our\nthree-dimensional color television, our anti-gravity sleeping chambers,\nour impeccably efficient, relentlessly cheerful robot servants, and our\nlibrary of thrills, entertainment, solace, diversion and escape--all\nimpressed on magnetic tape and awaiting our pleasure.\n\nI will go back to my five kinds of cigars and my sixteen kinds of\nbrandy; Bertha will return to her endless fantasy of pastries and\ndesserts--an endless, joyous parade of goodies, never farther away than\nthe nearest dumb-waiter door. And we will both become softer, heavier,\na little less responsive.\n\nWhen, as sometimes happens, the sweet lethargy threatens to choke off\nour breath, we will step into our flying platform and set its automatic\ncontrols for Miami, Palm Beach, or the Cote d'Azur. There are conducted\ntours to the Himalayas now, or to the \"lost\" cities of the South\nAmerican jungles, or to the bottom of any one of the seven seas. We\nwill bide our time, much as others do.\n\nBut we will survive these things: I still have my four hours per month\nat Central Computing and Control; Bertha has her endless and endlessly\nvarying work on committees (the last one was dedicated to the abolition\nof gambling at Las Vegas in favor of such wholesome games as Scrabble\nand checkers).\n\nWe cannot soften and slough away altogether, for when all else fails,\nwhen the last stronghold of the spirit is in peril, there is always the\nvision of year's end and another glorious vacation.",
