    "body": "Jeb was shaken from his bed; his dream told him it was a glacier with\nwild winds howling laughter, and when he opened his eyes, shivering, he\nsaw his wife, Laurie, had pulled the heat switch off. She stood there\nglaring. Today her hair was a lovely purple with a fashionable streak\nof gold starting from the forehead, but it didn't help the cold look on\nher face.\n\n\"Get up, you bum,\" she said in her sweet contralto. \"Go out and earn\nsome credits or I'll certify you.\"\n\nThe thought of being transferred by the Economy Agent to Assigned\nDuty Status, with its virtual imprisonment to monotony by the Welfare\nOffice, made Jeb tumble from bed and fumble for his shoes.\n\n\"My darling,\" he said placatingly, \"how beautiful you are this morning!\nHow undeserving I am of you!\"\n\n\"You're damn right about that,\" said Laurie with bitterness. \"When I\nthink of the men I could have married, the wonderful life I might have\nlived, instead of scrimping along with a no-good freelance Monitor\nlike you....\"\n\n\"_Sometimes_ I do pretty well. Three years ago, I sent you to the\nPleasure Palace for a month, remember?\"\n\n\"Three years ago. Big deal.\"\n\n\n\nShe flounced out of the room. Sadly, Jeb went to the closet and\nexamined the various uniforms and disguises that were part of his\nequipment as a freelance Monitor. As he selected the silver and black\nskintight suit of an Air Pollution Inspector, he wistfully remembered\nhow nice it had been when Laurie had smiled at him. Immediately a flood\nof determination filled him to go out and do big things today. Maybe\nhe would make a big strike and get a nice fat commission; then Laurie\nwould....\n\nThe televisor buzzed, flickered, and the genial face of the man from\nMarriage Relations appeared.\n\n\"Good morning, Monitor Jeb,\" said the man, smiling. \"And how are things\n'twixt you and your beloved?\"\n\n\"Rough,\" moaned Jeb. \"She's really in a foul mood today.\"\n\nThe man from Marriage Relations beamed. \"Fine, fine, glad to hear it.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" said Jeb.\n\n\"Her Sadism Index Rating went up five points,\" the man explained. \"We\nwanted to make sure we hadn't made an error. Well, that certainly is\ngood news for you two. I'll guess you'll both be all right now.\"\n\n\"All _right_? Are you _kidding_?\"\n\n\"Now, now, we know what's best for you. Your Masochism Rating is quite\nhigh, you know. Laurie is just what you need. Why, you two were _made_\nfor each other.\"\n\nSuddenly the man stopped talking, gasped, and the screen flickered and\nwent dead. Jeb's astonishment was wiped away by the soft, silvery bell\ntone of his portable Monitex, a flat two-by-six-inch machine resting on\na shelf nearby. As Jeb wildly lunged toward it, he saw it was glowing\nred, activated by a violation, and as he snatched it up, the coded\nreading dial had a notification: _Bx-P-203_.\n\nTrembling, Jeb pressed a button on the lower left of the Monitex and\na voice promptly droned mechanically from the waferlike loudspeaker\nhidden under the surface, giving details of the violation.\n\n\"Bx-P-203--At ten minutes after eight A.M., Monitex 27965 of\nFreelance Monitor Jeb picked up violation of Copyright on the phrase\n'were made for each other.' Said phrase property of Joint Owners\nregistered under Copyright of Verbal Phrases Act of 1996. Owners,\nMagnum Motion Picture Studios and Universal Publications. Fee for use\n80 credits, commission fifty per cent.\"\n\n\n\nThe voice went dead and the flat metal surface glowed with letters\nstrung into words reading \"Please Collect and Remit Total Fee.\"\n\nAs Jeb uttered a yelp of delight, Laurie came running into the room.\n\n\"I heard the Monitex bell,\" she said eagerly.\n\n\"You sure did,\" crowed Jeb. \"Now aren't you proud of me? I was smart\nenough to leave the Monitex on all night. We picked up a Verbal\nCopyright violation....\"\n\n\"You left it on all night?\" screeched Laurie, her joy fading. \"You\nimbecile, the leasing charge on the Monitex is ten credits an hour,\nisn't it? What's your commission on this violation?\"\n\n\"Forty credits. I--I guess I'm losing money, b-but....\"\n\nLaurie gave him her opinion of his supposed shrewdness.\n\nJeb unhappily went to the televisor and punched out a call on the\nbutton keyboard which would recall the image of the Marriage Relations\nrepresentative. He shrank back in alarm as the man's glaring face\nappeared.\n\n\"Sorry to hook you this way, old boy,\" said Jeb meekly, \"but it's\nmy job, you know. Got you on a Verbal for using 'were made for each\nother.' That phrase is owned by--\"\n\n\"You dirty, sneaking spy!\" yelled the man on the televisor screen.\n\"I'll bet your grandfather informed on diamond smugglers for a\npercentage.\"\n\n\"He....\" Jeb feebly started to protest.\n\n\"It's a hell of a thing,\" raved the other, \"when a man can't even use\nwords to express himself without paying....\"\n\nIn alarm, Jeb leaned forward and hastily punched a combination of\nbuttons on the televisor. One half the screen blanked. The image of\nthe Marriage Relations representative moved to the right and the lean,\npuritanical face of Jeb's supervisor, Dirdon, flared onto the left half.\n\nDirdon looked icily at Jeb. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"Complaint on policy and purpose of Copyright Law,\" said Jeb nervously.\n\"Would you please handle it, sir? I'll switch you.\"\n\n\n\nAs Dirdon's mouth pressed into a thin line and he nodded, Jeb flicked a\nswitch. Both men on the screen immediately turned profiles to Jeb and\nLaurie, seeing each other in their own screens.\n\n\"Did you have a complaint, sir?\" asked Dirdon.\n\n\"I don't know who the devil you are,\" shouted the man from Marriage\nRelations, \"but I assume you're one of those pirates cashing in on that\ncopyright swindle. That new law has gone much too far. Copyrighting a\nwork of skill, art, or expression is okay, I suppose, but to extend it\nto everyday speech, to verbal phrases--\"\n\n\"Now just a minute,\" said Dirdon briskly. \"You buy greeting cards, I\nsuppose, sir?\"\n\n\"So I buy greeting cards, so what?\"\n\n\"What are greeting cards exactly? Just a small square of paper with\na few words, a _very_ few words of sentiment on them. Words that any\nnormal person certainly might be able to--\"\n\n\"Any moron can write a better sentiment than those lousy cards express.\"\n\n\"But _you_ buy them sometimes?\"\n\n\"Well ... sometimes.\"\n\n\"Why?\" demanded Dirdon.\n\n\"Saves me the bother of figuring out what to say, I guess,\" was the\ngrowled answer.\n\n\"Right. And you _paid_ for these very few moronic phrases, paid good\nhard credits for them. Now isn't it just as logical to protect owners\nof a phrase when somebody else uses it verbally?\"\n\n\"But,\" said the man desperately, \"I didn't _want_ to violate the\nCopyright on Verbal Use. I didn't _know_ that phrase was under\nCopyright. Who can keep track of them all? Every day, more phrases and\nexpressions are under Copyright as somebody else's property. Why, first\nthing you know, there'll hardly be any words left to say.\"\n\n\n\n\"That isn't true,\" objected Dirdon. \"Copyright Law on Verbal Use is a\ngreat boon to society. Rule 7 for admission to protection requires that\nthe phrase covered be one which may be considered 'shopworn, overused\nand so artistically traditional that it is a wearisome truism.' That\nmeans that verbal mediocrity is heavily penalized, which is right and\nproper. Why, you ought to be ashamed to use a phrase like 'were made\nfor each other.' It's Monitors like Jeb who make you watch your words\nand think very carefully before you speak.\"\n\n\"Listen, stupid--\"\n\n\"Already,\" Dirdon plowed on, happily oratorical, \"our citizens are\nbeing forced to express themselves more richly, with initiative,\ncasting off triteness!\"\n\nThe man from Marriage Relations looked disgusted. \"Ah,\" he said\nangrily, \"why don't you drop dead.\"\n\nBong!\n\n\n\nThe man moaned as the Monitex Jeb held glowed red with another\nviolation. Jeb grinned and pressed the loudspeaker button.\n\n\"Mz-R-14,\" droned the voice. \"At half-past eight, Monitex 27965 of\nFreelance Monitor Jeb picked a violation of....\"\n\nThe man covered his ears. After a few moments, he took his hands away\nand looked numbly from the screen as Dirdon smirked.\n\n\"What's the Copyright fee on that one?\" he asked.\n\n\"The use of the words 'Drop Dead' will cost you ten credits,\" said Jeb.\n\"We'll bill you for both violations.\"\n\nDirdon was beaming as Jeb snapped the whole screen dark.\n\nWith a start, Jeb remembered Laurie and turned to face her anger. \"See,\nhoneybunch?\" he said hopefully. \"Even if I did lose a few credits on\nthe leasing charge by leaving the Monitex on all night, it looks like a\nlucky day. Why, I'll bet I make enough commissions today to send you on\na nice vacation.\"\n\nLaurie gave him a narrow-eyed, cold stare.\n\n\"You'd better,\" she said. \"Because I've just about had enough of you.\nEither you make a big killing today or I certify you by midnight\ntonight. Do you hear me?\"\n\nJeb nodded in fright. He scuttled out of the room, picking up a gravity\nharness from the stand in the foyer and not pausing to buckle himself\ninto it until she slammed the door behind him.\n\nSighing, Jeb got into the harness and took off. He floated out the\nopening at the end of the corridor at the sixty-story level and joined\nthe stream of commuters at two thousand feet.\n\nAs he set his speed at thirty miles an hour, he came abreast of a man\nwearing the solid gray uniform of an Unassigned Citizen. Jeb saw the\nlook of misery on the man's drawn face and felt so sympathetic, he\ndidn't even bother to hide his Monitex in its disguising parcel. You\nhad to be pretty low to make your money out of a guy in that tough\nstatus. _Hell_, thought Jeb defiantly, _let him see it and be warned; I\ndon't care. Even if the Inspector sees me._\n\nHe noted the Unassigned Citizen staring down at the panorama of the\nvast city beneath them. At different lower levels, myriad flights of\nstreaming citizens moved in various directions. The tremendous blocks\nof buildings had thin slits between them at the bottom of which were\nwalks filled with antlike figures.\n\n\"Ugly, huh?\" said Jeb.\n\nHe got a moody stare in return. \"Believe it or not, I suddenly find it\nbeautiful. Compared to where I'm heading, anyway.\"\n\n\n\nJeb was shocked. \"Oh?\"\n\n\"I've been certified,\" said the man bluntly. \"Not enough credits for\nsupport. I had to go to the Welfare Office and ask for assistance. Had\nmy own gravity harness repair shop till a month ago. But the new ones\nare foolproof, business fell off. Now I'm in for it.\"\n\n\"Gosh,\" muttered Jeb, \"that's really tough. But what do you mean,\n'compared to where you're heading?' Sure, you'll be assigned a dirty\nunderground job, on the cables maybe, and the pay will be ridiculous,\nbut it'll be right here, won't it?\"\n\n\"Haven't you heard?\" The other smiled grimly. \"So many of us small\nbusiness guys are being certified, the Welfare people had no more jobs.\nAnd you know the law. Indigents must be assigned to some duty. And it\njust happens that they're opening new mines on Mars and they can't get\nhelp. I've no choice.\"\n\n\"Mines?\" Jeb paled at the thought. \"That Melbonite dust. One speck\nthrough the sealed-in suit and you've got a burn they still can't\nheal.\" He shuddered; then, seeing the face of the Unassigned Citizen,\nhe said soothingly, \"But those suits are foolproof, I understand.\"\n\n\"Not always,\" said the man in gray. \"Anyway, they haven't licked the\nventilation problem. The last suits they tried to air-condition, so\nmuch Melbonite dust filtered in....\" He took a deep breath of horror.\n\"So the ones in use become awfully sweaty. I'm going to a living\nhell....\"\n\nBong!\n\nJeb's Monitex glowed red with a violation. \"Living Hell\" was an\nold-fashioned dramatic phrase somebody sharp had dug up after diligent\nstudy and copyrighted in the hope of picking up a few credits.\n\nAs Jeb numbly listened to the droning voice detail the facts and four\ncredits charge, the man in the gray suit said mirthlessly, \"Well, well,\nthat's just fine. Thanks a lot, my friend, for a nice sendoff.\"\n\nJeb snapped off the Monitex. \"Look,\" he said hurriedly, \"that was an\naccident. This one is on me. Here.\" He took four credit tokens from a\npocket and thrust the silvery rectangles at the Unassigned Citizen.\n\"Put these aside until you're billed for the violation and pay it with\nmy credits. Okay?\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said the man gratefully. \"I'll remember you.\"\n\nJeb gave him a twisted grin. \"You may not have to, pal. I may be right\nbeside you in the next shipment. My wife is ready to certify me for\nnon-support. If I don't clean up a nice fat commission by tonight,\nblooey, it's the mines for me, too.\"\n\n\n\nThe Unassigned Citizen started to form the words _Good luck!_ when Jeb\nhastily interrupted, \"That's on Copyright. Take it easy.\"\n\n\"Uh ... my heart goes beside yours,\" said the man, choosing his words\ncarefully. \"My sympathy has arms, one of which is around your mighty\nshoulders. I say to you farewell.\"\n\n\"Wonderful!\" exclaimed Jeb. He pumped the other's hand. \"I like the way\nyou put that. It's new. It has a freshness.\"\n\nThey smiled at each other. Then the oval building that housed The\nSuperMonitex Feeder came into view and Jeb waved good-by and swung out\nof the commuter stream in the regulation spiral under the cold eyes of\na golden-clad traffic cop. Jeb landed on the balcony ledge outside the\nninetieth-level corridor and walked in, finally entering a huge room in\nthe center of which was a circular wall with plug outlets and sets of\ndials and screens at intervals all the way around.\n\nJeb greeted a few of his co-workers, but didn't pause to gossip. He\nwasn't in a gay mood this morning, as were many of them who were\ngleefully recounting some of the slick violations they'd picked up. Jeb\nwent to the circular wall and plugged his Monitex into a receptacle. He\npunched a button marked _New Copyrights_ and waited for the humming to\nstop indicating that his Monitex had been fed all the latest phrases\nadded to the huge group protected by law.\n\nWith his Monitex coded up to date, its memory bank fattened, Jeb went\nto the supply room to requisition a hollowed-out air pollution meter to\nconceal his Monitex. A hand tapped his shoulder.\n\n\"Hi, there,\" said Monitor Platt, a lean-faced, smirking man Jeb\ndisliked. \"I just came off night shift. Had a big evening.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\" asked Jeb, his skin crawling. Monitor Platt specialized in\ncopyright violations in the area of lakes and parks where lovers\nmurmured words they soon found out were not at all new and quite\nexpensive.\n\nMonitor Platt chuckled. \"Been cleaning up on a new copyright just\nregistered. The good old wolf whistle. One hundred credits fee.\"\n\nEven Jeb was startled. \"But that's not a phrase.\"\n\n\"No, but it's a 'shopworn, overused and wearisome truism,' so they\nslipped it through.\"\n\n\"Golly, next thing you know, they'll be copyrighting a deep sigh or\nthe smacking sound of a kiss.\"\n\n\n\nMonitor Platt laughed in appreciation. Then, as Jeb frowned and\nattended to fitting his detector into the shell of the air pollution\nmeter, Monitor Platt regaled him with the violations that had poured\ncredits into his pockets.\n\n\"Got a cute dame, nice curves, getting a good hugging under the moon\nnear the lake. She says timidly to this sap, 'It's the first time\nI've ever been kissed, honestly.' Bong! Fifty credits for the expense\naccount. And another one I picked up in a canoe parked on the bank.\nThis guy says soulfully, 'I'm not the marrying kind, but....' He never\ngets a chance to finish. Bong! Thirty credits. I sure cleaned up today.\nIf I were you, I'd head straight for the snuggle spots. A whole raft\nof corny love lines have been blanketed in, you know, and nobody's\nalerted.\"\n\n\"Uh, well,\" muttered Jeb, who didn't want any enemies and so didn't\nexpress his feelings about making a living from such a source, \"I\nalready have my schedule figured out, but I'll keep it in mind.\"\n\n\"Where you headed for?\"\n\nMonitor Jeb was relieved when the big bell sounded, its brassy\nreverberations warning Monitors to quit gabbing and get out into the\nfield to scoop up violations and revenue for the corporation. The\npaunchy office manager, seated up on a small balcony overlooking\nthe giant hall, saw that the signal was, as usual, being ignored.\nIndignantly he punched a button on the board facing him and a repulsive\nodor filled the air which had the Monitors hastily seizing their\nequipment and leaving the building.\n\nJeb gladly took off into the windy canyons between the skyscrapers.\nInstead of ascending, he plummeted down forty stories and drifted\nalong, his nostrils twitching with the bad air at this height.\nFleetingly, he had the grumbling thought that, with present-day\ntechnology, there was no excuse at all for polluted atmosphere.\n\n_Oh, well_, he thought, _one of these days, somebody public-minded\nwill do something about it. Right now, I've got to make enough to stop\nLaurie from certifying me._\n\nHe felt a sudden chill as he recalled his wife's threat. Quickly he\nsought out the first location he'd mapped out for some easy revenue,\nthe personnel office of the Air Pollution Control Corp. Jeb switched\noff anti-gravity and heavily walked through the corridor, stepped\ninside the deep-rugged, gray and green office and joined the small\nnervous group of inspectors waiting for interviews.\n\n\n\nJeb, in his air pollution uniform, was as acceptable as a long-used\npiece of furniture. Unnoticed, he sat on one of the hard benches with\nthe others. They stared and listened to the interview being conducted\nby the genial, balding man behind the open partition ten feet away. The\nair pollution inspector facing him was tense, pale and overanxious.\n\n\"Yes, indeed, you _do_ have a good record,\" the personnel man was\nsaying approvingly. \"No absences in five years, no latenesses. Very\ngood indeed.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said the air pollution inspector eagerly, \"I'll be upgraded?\nI'll get that promotion promised two years ago?\"\n\nThe personnel man cleared his throat, but his smile remained radiant.\n\"Just as soon as business picks up, we'll give you a promotion and\nraise in pay....\"\n\nBong!\n\nA roar of mirth arose from the waiting air pollution men as Monitor Jeb\nnervously pulled his Monitex from its concealing pollution meter shell\nand read the violation off to the enraged personnel man. A fifty credit\nfee for use of the copyrighted verbal phrase _Just as soon as business\npicks up, we'll give you a promotion and raise in pay._\n\nAs Jeb escaped the wrath of his victim, one of the men snickering\nnearby muttered, \"Hah! He'll have to rack his tiny brain for a new way\nof stalling us from now on.\"\n\nIn the next three hours, Jeb drove himself hard. He picked up a twenty\ncredit fee when a doorman outside a Teletheatre had bonged the Monitex\nwith \"Plenty of seats inside!\" He scooped up another violation in a\nbar when a bleary-eyed man with veins showing in his nose murmured to\nthe bartender, \"Well, I'll have just _one_ more.\" He wandered to the\ntelephone booths and waited for one of the standby violations to fall\ninto his pocket; sure enough, a handsome, dark-eyed fellow murmured\ninto the mouthpiece, \"I'll be working late tonight again, honey; sorry.\"\n\nThe time passed too swiftly and when Jeb paused to get a bite of food,\nhe saw, dismayed, that even though he was having a pretty good day, it\nwas far from the killing he'd promised Laurie. Ten and twenty credit\nviolations didn't make a man rich.\n\n_What I need is one of the really big ones_, thought Jeb desperately.\n\nWith fumbling fingers, he pressed out a core number on the Monitex.\n\nIt glowed blue.\n\nThe voice droned, \"Information!\"\n\nJeb asked eagerly, \"What have we got with fees of a thousand credits\nand higher?\"\n\n\n\nA moment hummed by. Then the voice announced that a large batch of\npolitical \"corn\" had been copyrighted in view of the current election\ncampaign. Jeb listened with mounting excitement to some of them: _If I\nam elected, taxes will be reduced.... As I look upon the intelligent\nfaces in my audience.... I am reminded of a story.... What a lovely\nchild, Madam.... A helicopter on every roof...._\n\nJeb shut it off, perspiration breaking out on his face. It was a\nuranium mine! Jeb's mind reeled at the astonishing fee set for these\ncopyright violations. A thousand credits per use. The party in power\nwas really out to fight off the opposing Traditionalist Party with\nevery possible trick, with the result that Jeb could make the biggest\ncleanup of his life.\n\nThat is, if he got away alive.\n\nFull of foreboding, Jeb floated up toward the meeting rooms of the\nlocal Traditionalist Headquarters, which were on the fiftieth level\nof a nearby skyscraper. His terrified adrenal glands kicked his heart\ninto a frenzy. The boys who ran the local club were no patsies. Many\nan argumentative citizen had been found floating in the rarified\nstratosphere, frozen stiff, with his anti-gravity belt turned on full\nand his hands bound so he could not stop the upward climb.\n\nMonitor Jeb nervously drifted into the corridor opening and restored\ngravity. He sneaked past the open door, getting a quick glimpse of a\nhall filled with citizens listening to a red-faced, stoutish man on a\nplatform.\n\nJeb frantically searched for and, with throat-catching relief,\nfound the back entrance to the big hall. It led to a dusty area of\nscaffolding and discarded, rusting tools. Now Jeb was crawling down an\nincline leading under the platform and found the small, railed-off area\nwhich once had housed a hidden prompter for musical entertainments.\n\nPanting, Jeb squatted in the dark, hearing the booming voice just above\nhim, only slightly muffled. As Jeb shoved the Monitex up against the\ncrack in the boards over him, the speaker's voice came to him strongly,\n\"Now, fellers, you're all precinct captains and it's a helluva empty\ntitle to have when your party is outa power. But if we get back on the\ngravy train--well, need I say more?\"\n\nA muffled roar from the audience made Jeb crouch worriedly.\n\n\"Now we're gonna take this election, see? I want all you _loyal party\nworkers_....\"\n\nBong!\n\n\n\nHowls of rage shook the walls and reverberated through to Jeb as the\npolitical hacks recognized the sound and understood that somewhere a\nMonitex had automatically recorded the voice vibration pattern of the\nspeaker in a Verbal Copyright violation.\n\n\"Kill the dirty spy!\" screamed the speaker.\n\nBong! went the Monitex.\n\n\"Lynch him!\"\n\nIn three minutes of unguarded outrage, Jeb had recorded ten thousand\ncredits in violations which the speakers never could escape because,\nlike fingerprints, all voice patterns were registered by the government.\n\nJeb turned to the exit behind him and crawled painfully for twenty\nfeet, then got up and began running. He ran straight into a brawny body\nat the turn of the corridor. The next thing he knew, he was on his back\nand ruthless hands were banging his head against the floor.\n\nThe siren of a golden-clad policeman cut the air and magically the\nhands fell away, leaving Jeb sprawling and groggy.\n\nAfter a moment, he was able to focus his eyes. The policeman stared\ndown at him, fists authoritatively on his hips.\n\n\"Well, I came just in time, eh?\" said the cop. \"Saved your neck.\"\n\nBong! went the Monitex.\n\nJeb said hastily, \"It's all right, Officer. It's on the house.\"\n\n\"It had damn well better be,\" growled the policeman. \"If you know\nwhat's good for you--\"\n\nBong! went the Monitex.\n\n\"Go on, get outa here before I run ya in,\" yelled the officer.\n\nBong! went the Monitex.\n\n\n\n\"Have a good time, dear,\" Jeb called after Laurie as she happily took\noff into space from their level, clutching her purse, which was jammed\nwith enough credits to keep her brimful of fun for two whole months at\nthe Pleasure Palace.\n\n\"Don't you worry about that,\" said Laurie over her shoulder.\n\nJeb went back to his apartment. He stretched out on the couch,\ncontentment welling up in him. He opened the footstool nearby\nand, within its archaic shape, slid open the cunningly concealed\nrefrigerator. He took out a plastic cone of beer.\n\n\"A-ah!\" sighed Jeb. How wonderful to be alone, free of Laurie's nagging\nfor two whole months! A superb reward for his hard work. How clever of\nthe government to have passed such a regulation!\n\nAfter a while, like wax melting, his grin drooped away. It certainly\nwas quiet, wasn't it?\n\nWithin half an hour, he was wild and didn't know why. Jittering, he\ndialed his televisor and the man from Marriage Relations appeared on\nthe screen. He glared at Jeb and cautiously looked around for the\nMonitex until he spotted it.\n\n\"Shut that thing off or no advice,\" snapped the man.\n\n\"It's _off_! Look, I don't know what's bothering me. Can I have special\npermission to join my wife on her vacation? Or get her back here?\"\n\n\"Afraid not,\" said the man. \"The principle of working so one's wife\ncan have a vacation has been established through the centuries; the\ngovernment merely put it into law. And as for joining her or getting\nher back here--that's against the law.\"\n\n\"But that's unfair!\" yelled Jeb.\n\n\"Oh?\" The man smiled. \"So! I'm glad to see how happy, how perfect is\nthe marriage we arranged for you.\" He rubbed his hands in delight.\n\"She's just barely gone and already you miss her. Wonderful.\"\n\n\"Wonderful? I'm _suffering_!\"\n\nThe man from Marriage Relations glanced at a dial nearby. \"Of course\nyou are. Suffering is the ideal joy for a Masochist. Just think what a\nlovely two months of missing her you'll have.\"\n\n\"All right, so it's a rule that I have to send her on a vacation and\ncan't join her,\" Jeb complained savagely, \"but, damn it, she doesn't\nhave to _enjoy_ it!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the man, looking back to Jeb, \"there's the answer. Your\nMasochism index has gone down any number of points. You're angry!\"\n\nJeb thought it over. \"You bet I am! But what do I do about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" said the man from Marriage Relations, \"the same thing husbands\nhave been doing ever since they started working to send their wives\naway on vacations. When the cat's away, you know--\" He stopped in alarm.\n\nJeb grinned. \"I told you the Monitex is off. But thanks for the trite\ntruism. She thinks _she's_ the only one who'll have a vacation, eh?\nI'll show her!\"\n\n\"Service is our motto. And it really is,\" the man said pugnaciously.\n\"We own the Copyright.\"\n\nThe face flickered off the screen and Jeb began poking around in\ninnocent-looking secret places for a little black book he hadn't\nthought of using in years.\n\nHe was dismayed to find himself singing \"My wife's gone to the country,\nhooray, hooray,\" until he remembered that he actually had shut off the\nMonitex.",
