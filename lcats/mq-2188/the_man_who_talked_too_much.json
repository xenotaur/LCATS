    "body": "The Westbound Overland on the Santa Fe Railway, although doing its\nsplendid fifty miles an hour, seemed to two of its passengers to be\nmoving at a snail\u2019s pace; for the journey ahead of them was long, and\ntheir destination, which was far northward from San Francisco, the only\nspot on earth worth reaching. To increase boredom they had for so long\nbeen partners and fellow adventurers that all ordinary topics of\nconversation between them had long been exhausted, and the barren\nscenery through which they passed was too familiar to be worthy of\ninterest.\n\nFurthermore, they had, but a few days previously, escaped from a certain\ndistrict in Mexico where for a brief time they had gambled their lives,\nand were still too glad of escape to indulge in foolish conversation.\nThe veriest fool could not have mistaken them for other than what they\nwere; miners, prospectors, men of still places where life is crude and\nhard. There was nothing to distinguish them or attract a second glance,\nother than their incongruity of size; for one was a magnificent giant,\nand the other a blocky, stocky runt, with shoulders much too large for\nhis stature and a flaming red head that seemed to have defied even the\nbleaching of the sun. That these two were known to frontiersmen and men\nof their ilk, over many thousands of miles, as \u201cDavid and Goliath,\u201d\nmeant nothing to them, nor to any of their fellow passengers; but that\nthey had casually reversed a seat in the smoking car and thus sprawled\nover two seats instead of one did, as a magnet, attract the attention of\na man who wandered inward with a very large and very new alligator-skin\nsuit case that he dropped in the aisle beside them.\n\n\u201cYou boys mind if I sit in this seat?\u201d he demanded, and, although they\nvery much did, they promptly lowered their feet to the floor, doubled\ntheir tired legs back into cramped postures, and told him to \u201cset in.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoin\u2019 far?\u201d he asked, before his weight had settled.\n\n\u201cClean through to Los Angeles, then to San Francisco,\u201d David, the\nsmaller man, replied after a moment\u2019s pause.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m bound for Frisco myself,\u201d the man said, and then as if considering\nan introduction necessary, added, \u201cI\u2019m Cochran. \u2018Lucky\u2019 Cochran, as they\ncall me.\u201d\n\nThe partners did not appear impressed, or act as if they deemed it\nincumbent on them to either register surprise, curiosity, or tell him\ntheir own names.\n\n\u201cReckon you\u2019ve heard of me--Lucky Cochran?\u201d the newcomer asked with a\ngrin that was entirely self-complacent.\n\nThe partners studied him for a moment and then the smaller man said, not\nwithout a suggestion of disapproval, \u201cNope. Can\u2019t say I ever did. Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever heard tell of me? Lucky Cochran? I\u2019m the man that owned the ranch\nat Placides, where they struck oil. I\u2019m the boy they paid twenty\nthousand to last week and-- By gosh!--if things go right, I\u2019ll get a\nmillion more.\u201d\n\nGoliath yawned openly, stretched his long legs out into the aisle, and\nDavid unblinkingly gazed at him as if taking stock of all his new\nclothing, his diamond stud screwed into a flannel shirt, the diamond\nring on his heavy, thick-knuckled hands, and thence downward to his big\nfeet that were incased in patent-leather shoes of a design affected by\n\u201csporting gents\u201d of the previous decade.\n\n\u201cHumph! He looks it, don\u2019t he?\u201d David said, turning toward his partner.\nAs if his attention had just been casually called to something outside,\nGoliath, in turn, appraised Mr. Cochran and then rumbled, \u201cHe sure\ndoes!\u201d\n\nEntirely unabashed by their comments, Mr. Cochran seemed, on the\ncontrary, to be highly pleased.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me!\u201d he remarked. \u201cLucky Cochran! That\u2019s me, boys.\u201d And then, as\nif stimulated to speech, he began talking. He told them the history of\nhis new wealth, of his lean years, of where he had originated. He even\ntold them stories. His tongue wagged as if on a pivot, pendulous, and\nthe fact that neither of them evidenced the slightest interest, or\ninterpolated any remarks, did not in the least curb his loquacity.\n\nThe partners moved into the emigrant sleeping car, where they breathed\ndeeply, thanking Heaven that they had lost Mr. Lucky Cochran. Two hours\nlater Mr. Cochran also moved in and greeted them like long-lost\nbrothers. The partners fled to the smoking compartment, and Cochran\npursued them. The tiny cabin was filled with men and smoke, and to their\nrelief Cochran began telling his story to those therein assembled, and\nthe partners fled to the smoking car at the front end of the train. They\nsat quietly, glad of the fact that no conversation was hurled at them;\nfor they were wonderfully skilled as listeners, although short in words.\nOne man was telling another of how much cheaper it was to travel to San\nFrancisco from San Diego by steamer than by rail, and how much more\ncomfortable if one had time to spare. The partners listened and weighed\nhis words.\n\n\u201cGoliath, what\u2019s the matter with our takin\u2019 the boat up?\u201d David asked,\nafter the man and his companion had gone.\n\n\u201cJust the thing, provided we can lose that lucky guy,\u201d said Goliath with\na grin.\n\n\u201cRight! Anything to lose him,\u201d David agreed, and they considered their\ninformation fortunate when Mr. Cochran found them again and opened up\nhis verbal batteries with, \u201cBy gosh! Been lookin\u2019 for you boys. It\u2019s\nmighty lucky we\u2019re to keep company all the way to Frisco. Where do we\nstop in Los Angeles?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t stop,\u201d said David sourly. \u201cWe\u2019ve got business down in San\nDiego.\u201d\n\n\u201cSan Dieger, eh? Come to think of it, I ain\u2019t never been to San Dieger.\nTell you what I\u2019ll do, I\u2019ll go along with you!\u201d he added benignantly, as\nif doing them a great favor.\n\nIt was on the tip of Goliath\u2019s tongue to say, \u201cNot by a dam sight, you\nwon\u2019t,\u201d but David broke in hurriedly with, \u201cCome to think of it we ain\u2019t\nso sure. Maybe we won\u2019t go that way. We\u2019re thinkin\u2019 it over.\u201d\n\nBy skillful dodging they succeeded in losing Cochran, when they arrived\nat Los Angeles, and went to an obscure hotel, where they intended to\nstop overnight and break their journey; for railways to men of their\nstamp were like temporary prisons. Unfortunately, after dining, they sat\nin the rotunda which was ablaze with lights. In from the street rushed\nMr. Cochran with great jubilation.\n\n\u201cMighty nice I found you!\u201d he roared. \u201cBeen lookin\u2019 everywhere for you.\nA fool nigger grabbed my suit case there at the deepot, and while I was\nchasin\u2019 him I lost you. Reckon you were worried about me, too, wa\u2019n\u2019t\nyou?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were! We were!\u201d David declared, most fervently and truthfully.\n\nCochran bolted from them to the desk, held a conversation with the\nclerk, produced a wad of bills as big as a Mohave maiden\u2019s leg, and then\nrushed back to them and seized a vacant chair.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right! Got her fixed up now. Sent over to the Willard House\nfor my things and got a room here. By gosh! It\u2019s a lonesome thing to be\ntravelin\u2019 alone. I\u2019m tickled as stiff as a burro\u2019s ears just to be with\nyou two fellers, because it seems as if we was real old friends. But\nit\u2019s all right now, don\u2019t you worry none!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wasn\u2019t; but we are!\u201d growled Goliath, but Cochran took not the\nslightest notice. He wanted to take them to a show. Failing in that, he\nwanted to buy drinks. Failing in that, he bought three cigars at a\ndollar each. They could find no complaint regarding his liberality. He\nwould have gladly paid their traveling expenses to continue in their\ncompany.\n\nAnd then, when they were ripe to murder him, he did something that at\nleast gained their tolerance. A terribly bent and crippled old man came\ntimorously into the rotunda with a tray of collar buttons and shoe\nlaces. The clerk spotted the vender, called harshly, and a burly porter\nrushed forward to eject such an objectionable intruder. Cochran rose to\nthe occasion.\n\n\u201cYou git to hell out of this!\u201d he roared, planting himself between the\nporter and the derelict, and poking a hard, huge fist under the\nbouncer\u2019s nose. \u201cThis old feller\u2019s a friend of mine. You let him alone.\nCome over here and sit down, old hoss. Here--take my cheer!\u201d\n\nMuch to the partners\u2019 interest in the proceedings, Lucky Cochran seated\nthe old man and said to him reassuringly, \u201cNever mind, old feller. It\u2019s\nme that\u2019s lookin\u2019 after you. Me--Lucky Cochran. What I say goes, back in\nTexas, where I\u2019m known. I know tough luck when I see it. Had a heap of\nit myself. What\u2019s ailin\u2019 your legs and back? Rheumatiz? U-m-m-mh! I know\nwhat that is, too. Had it myself.\u201d\n\nThe partners watched Cochran with a dawning respect and--as\nusual--listened. Cochran certainly had sympathy for one who was in what\nhe called \u201ctough luck.\u201d He asked personal questions that made the\npartners wince, and then smoothed the wincing with his kindly drawl.\nThey were gradually getting bored when Cochran suddenly said: \u201cSee here,\nuncle, I was goin\u2019 off on a bust. I got money, I have; but I reckon I\ncouldn\u2019t blow in all I got comin\u2019 to me, if I took twenty years for the\njob. And I reckon I can cut out a few things I was goin\u2019 to do, anyhow.\nYou said just now that if you had a thousand you could buy a cigar shop\nyou know of, where you wouldn\u2019t have to worry no more.\u201d\n\nHe dug out that huge roll of bills again, wet his heavy thumb on the tip\nof his tongue, and proceeded to laboriously count off some bills. He\nwent over them twice, while the partners, aghast, watched him. He thrust\nthe bills into the old man\u2019s half-reluctant hands.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cyou hustle out and buy that cigar place. I hate to see\na busted up old feller like you peddlin\u2019 things in hotels and saloons.\nAlways makes me think of what might have happened to me. Come on. I\u2019ll\nwalk out to the door with you so\u2019s no one can bother you.\u201d\n\nAnd he did escort the derelict to the exit and for a few minutes\ndisappeared with him. The partners stared at each other, as if doubting\ntheir senses.\n\n\u201cWell--well--what do you think of that!\u201d exclaimed Goliath.\n\n\u201cThink of it? Can\u2019t quite say--yet! But it looks to me as if there was\nsome good streaks in this piece of bad bacon after all,\u201d David said, and\nthen added, \u201cThe big boob!\u201d\n\nIt may have been the somewhat kindly feeling engendered by Cochran\u2019s\nliberality that caused the partners, after much consultation, to leave a\nnote to be delivered to him after their departure on the following\nmorning. It read:\n\n    Impossible for us to wait to say good-by and good luck to\n    you. Found we have to hustle to catch the train. Better not\n    take the trouble to wait for us to come back, but go on to\n    San Francisco. May your good luck continue.\n\nDavid was very proud of his note.\n\n\u201cShe don\u2019t tell lies, nor nothin\u2019, and don\u2019t give nothin\u2019 away,\u201d he\nremarked, as he sealed it into a hotel envelope, carried it down to the\ndesk, after carefully reconnoitering to make sure that Cochran, the\nloquacious, was not in the lobby, paid their bills, and gleefully joined\nGoliath who appeared with their suit cases.\n\nIn San Diego they had to wait twenty-four hours for the northbound\nsteamer, during which time they lived in some slight apprehension lest\nCochran appear; but once they had climbed the gangplank and been shown\nto their cabin, they felt secure and jubilant. They went back on the\ndeck to see the steamer cast off, interested, as landsmen usually are,\nin anything so novel. The \u201call off\u201d had been given, the last of the\nstewards had come aboard, and the order had been given to clear the\ngangway, when there was a whirl of excitement in the outskirts on the\ndock, and there appeared, breathless, but loudly yelling an appeal to\nhold fast until he could get aboard, a belated passenger.\n\n\u201cGood Lord! It\u2019s him all right!\u201d groaned David.\n\n\u201cHis luck holds good; but--hang it all!--ours is out!\u201d Goliath growled,\nas Cochran climbed aboard, discovered them, and, dropping his big\nalligator suit case to which he had clung, rushed upon them.\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t I the lucky one, eh? Lucky Cochran! That\u2019s me. You spoke in your\nletter about troublin\u2019 to wait for you; but, pshaw! It wasn\u2019t any\ntrouble to me, although it was right thoughtful and kind of you fellers\nto say so. Nothin\u2019 ever troubles me. So I just found out from the boss\nporter at the hotel how you\u2019d been makin\u2019 inquiries about trains to San\nDieger, and about the boat, and says I, \u2018I\u2019ll just pop down and join\n\u2019em, and won\u2019t they be surprised to see that I\u2019m goin\u2019 to keep \u2019em\ncompany.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re surprised, all right!\u201d David remarked, but Cochran did not\nobserve that he had omitted any reference to the happiness his arrival\nhad caused.\n\nTheir sole remaining chance for peace now rested upon wind, wave, and\nweather. They hoped, earnestly, that Mr. Cochran would be as sick as the\nwhale that swallowed Jonah; but Cochran\u2019s luck held, and if the ship had\nturned somersaults, he would have merely laughed. For an hour they\nwatched him solicitously before they gave way to despair. He talked as\njoyously as ever, roaring with laughter at his own jokes, and bubbling\nover with human kindness in sufficient quantities to deter them from\nmurdering him. If he could have but kept his mouth shut, the partners\nwould have rather liked him. And then Goliath suddenly gave a groan,\nclutched himself around the abdomen and said, \u201cI got to get below. I\nfeel awful, I do!\u201d And away he went.\n\n\u201cPore feller! I\u2019m awful sorry for him. Anybody sick or ailin\u2019 always\ngits my goat,\u201d said Cochran sympathetically. \u201cI couldn\u2019t kill a\nrattlesnake, if it was hurted. One time I had a burro that busted its\nforeleg right above the pastern joint, and I couldn\u2019t shoot it. Didn\u2019t\nhave the heart! And every time I tried to nuss it the damn thing bit\nme.\u201d\n\nDavid failed to draw the sympathetic connection between rattlers, mules,\nand his partner. Indeed, at the moment, he was solicitous for Goliath,\nand after a time went to investigate, and try to help, having much\ndifficulty in dissuading Cochran from accompanying him. He found the\ngiant on his back in the lower berth, calmly reading a dime novel.\n\n\u201cThought you was seasick?\u201d David blurted through the half-opened door.\n\n\u201cSeasick? Hell! I was talk sick!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood! Never thought of that. I reckon I\u2019m seasick, too. But what are we\ngoin\u2019 to do? Stay shut up here all the way to Frisco?\u201d\n\n\u201cEither that, or chuck the perpetual-motion talkin\u2019 machine overboard,\u201d\ngrowled Goliath.\n\n\u201cGot another one of them dime novels? Gimme it. I\u2019m sick, too,\u201d David\nsaid as he climbed into the upper berth.\n\nAt intervals for the first few hours Cochran called on them, bringing\nvarious remedies that he had solicited from their fellow passengers; but\nwhen dusk came the partners ventured out, trusting to the darkness to\nescape the attention of their well-wisher. As time went on they gained\ncourage, and began to enjoy their freedom. They even dared to saunter\nalong the decks. From the smoke room, which was forward under the\nbridge, came inviting sounds of conversation, merriment, and human\nsociety. They paused and looked enviously through the open window and\nbreathed more freely, for they discerned Cochran absorbed in a game of\npoker, but still talking steadily.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me. Lucky Cochran!\u201d they heard him explode, as he raked in a\npot.\n\n\u201cGood old sport! Hope he plays poker from now until this boat ties up at\nthe dock,\u201d David remarked. \u201cThat\u2019ll keep him busy, and make it a lot\nnicer for us.\u201d\n\nTheir hopes seemed justified when, after the deck lights were turned out\nthey retired to their cabin, for Cochran was still playing and still\nwinning--and still garrulous. It was a late session, they learned on the\nfollowing morning. They were leaning up against a deck cabin, staring at\nthe sea and, as usual, saying nothing because there was nothing to talk\nabout, when through the open window near them they heard a yawn, as some\nlate sleeper turned in his berth, and then an answering yawn.\n\n\u201cGad! I dreamed that sucker Cochran was talking to me in my sleep. Bad\nenough to have to sit up until three o\u2019clock and listen to him. We\ncertainly do have to work hard to earn our money. What?\u201d\n\nThe other voice yawned and said, \u201cYep; but what we want to watch out for\nmost is the howl he\u2019ll make when we collar his bank roll. Rubes like him\nalways yelp the loudest.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got no friends aboard, I reckon; and he\u2019s too much of a mutt to\nmake a gun play, and, besides, we don\u2019t want to pull it off, if we can\nhelp it, until just about the time the boat is ready to land. He can\nyell all he wants to then, and we can stand it.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018\u2019Tis music to the gambler\u2019s ears to hear the loser squeal,\u2019\u201d the other\nvoice quoted the old proverb.\n\nDavid looked across at Goliath, gestured for silence, and slipped\ncautiously away. Goliath, with equal care, followed him until they were\nwell aft, but from where they could keep an observant eye on the door of\nthe cabin occupied by the complacent \u201cSure-thing men.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s the way of it, eh?\u201d Goliath rumbled.\n\n\u201cLooks like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cReckon we ought to wise him up. I\u2019d not do that, if it wasn\u2019t\nfor--ummh!--the way he acted there in the hotel and--it\u2019s better for him\nto give his money away where it\u2019ll do some good, than pass it over to a\ncouple of sharks.\u201d\n\nAfter a time, the door they had under observation opened, and two men\nsauntered out who were neither over nor underdressed, but had the\nappearance of being nothing more than possibly a pair of small-town\nmerchants. The partners marked them well for future identification and\npatiently waited for Lucky Cochran to appear. He came after a further\ninterval, and David, with characteristic bluntness, opened up on him.\n\n\u201cYou played poker until three o\u2019clock this mornin\u2019 with some strangers,\u201d\nhe said, staring at the prosperous one. \u201cAnd me and my pardner have\nfound out that they\u2019re nothin\u2019 but a pair of sharps out to do you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOut to do me? Out to do Lucky Cochran? It\u2019s a joke! Why, boys, I won\nfifteen hundred dollars last night. Nobody can beat me. I\u2019m Cochran.\nLucky Cochran!\u201d\n\nAnd his \u201cHaw, haw, haw!\u201d was so loud it startled even the deck steward,\nwho barely missed dropping a cup of hot coffee he was carrying to an\ninvalid, and prompted an A. B. on the boat deck to peer over, to learn\nwhether there was a menagerie aboard.\n\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re lucky, are you?\u201d David answered with a badly concealed\nsneer. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve won at the first sitting, have you? Well, see here,\nCochran, I\u2019m goin\u2019 to tell you something. The boob always wins at\nfirst--until the stakes get high. After that his luck changes. If we\u2019re\neither locoed, or talkin\u2019 through our hats, I\u2019ll tell you what we\noverheard this mornin\u2019.\u201d And then, in confidential tones, he repeated\nall the conversation that had come through the cabin window shutters,\nand ended with, \u201cIf you\u2019ll take a little pasear with me I\u2019ll point the\ntwo crooks out to you, so that you can steer clear of another game with\nthem, and quit fifteen hundred to the good.\u201d\n\n\u201cPsho!\u201d said Lucky Cochran. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean it! Come on and show \u2019em to\nme.\u201d\n\nThe three men promenaded the deck, casually looked into the smoke room,\nand finally discovered their quarry in the bows holding earnest\nconversation.\n\n\u201cThere they are,\u201d David said, pointing at them.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s them, all right,\u201d Cochran agreed. \u201cAnd right nice sociable\nfellers they are, too. Don\u2019t see how it kin be that two such nice\nfellers as them could be out to skin a good old feller like me. Think\nI\u2019ll go over and tell \u2019em what I think of \u2019em, right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d said David. \u201cWe\u2019ll come along and see you through.\u201d\n\nCochran moved as if to carry out an intention, then stopped, looked at\nthe partners and wagged his head slowly and solemnly.\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d he said, then paused and grinned. \u201cI reckon I\u2019ve got the best of\nit as it is--got their fifteen hundred, so I\u2019ll just hang on to it and\nleave \u2019em alone, and stick around with you two fellers. I was mighty\nlonesome yisttiday without you two and-- By heck! I\u2019m glad you ain\u2019t\nseasick any more. Reminds me of a story about a feller that--\u201d\n\nAnd the partners glanced at each other, as if admitting a great mistake;\nfor the garrulous one was on again, had promised to stay with them\nindefinitely, closely, intimately, and--talk their heads off! He clung\nto them like a loving leach, or as a bride of seventy adheres to a\nbridegroom of twenty, or as does the unbreakable limpet to its gray\nrock. His sole virtue was that he never repeated himself. Their sole\nhope was that some time he would run down, get hoarse, or have paralysis\nof the tongue. He tried indirectly to learn all about them, where they\nhad been, their business, whither bound, and what luck they had endured\nor profited by; but the partners, bored, surfeited with words, and\ncasting about for means of escape, maintained their customary reticence.\n\nDavid was the first to escape and most callously deserted his partner;\nbut Goliath, being less diplomatic, eventually invented an excuse and\nran, rather than walked, to a distant part of the ship. The partners met\nin their cabin and took turns in imprecating the kindliness that had\ninspired their well-meant interference.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a cuss what happens to him now. He\u2019s been warned, and if\nhe loses his wad it\u2019s not our fault,\u201d David asserted.\n\n\u201cNeither do I care what happens to him,\u201d Goliath growled. \u201cI ain\u2019t no\nhero, nor Christian martyr, nor nothin\u2019 like that. All I want is to have\nhim keep away from me. I\u2019m goin\u2019 to read from now on, right here in this\ncabin. I\u2019m afraid to go out on the deck.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo\u2019m I!\u201d David asserted; but their resolution broke, after some hours,\nand the craving for open space, habitual with such men of outdoors,\novercame their fears of Cochran, and they slipped away to the decks\nagain. Almost surreptitiously they looked through a window of the smoke\nroom and then frowned. Cochran was sitting at the same table with the\nsame pair of gamblers, playing with what was probably the same deck of\ncards and talking Just as steadily as ever before. Even as the partners\nlooked they caught signs of undoubted signals between the two card\nsharps, saw a bet brought to a finale, and by the interchange of money\ndiscerned that Lucky Cochran\u2019s luck seemed to be out, and that he was\npassing over considerable sums of his accidental wealth. Save for these\nthree earnest players, the smoke room was deserted.\n\n\u201cThink we ought to go in and bust up that combination?\u201d Goliath asked.\n\n\u201cHumph! That old boob would think we were hornin\u2019 into his business. The\npair of cutthroats he\u2019s playin\u2019 with would yell to the skipper of the\nship for help, and--no!--all we can do is to get him outside and tell\nhim he\u2019s bein\u2019 trimmed by good sign work.\u201d\n\nDavid sauntered in through the door and said, with an attempt at\nsuavity: \u201cCochran, I\u2019d like to talk to you a minute outside. It\u2019s\nsomethin\u2019 right urgent. Sorry to disturb your game, but--\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, pardner, sure!\u201d said Cochran, lumbering to his feet and sweeping\nhis money into his pockets. \u201cSee you fellers later,\u201d he said to the two\ngamblers who glared at David, exchanged glances of inquiry, and then\nresignedly began pocketing their own money. But David and Goliath gained\nnothing by their warning. Cochran merely grinned and then chuckled, and\nfinally laughed.\n\n\u201cYou boys just let me alone,\u201d he said. \u201cMe lose? Lucky Cochran? Not by\nthe mill by the damsite. Why--say!--I\u2019m still winner by nigh onto four\nhundred dollars. Can\u2019t beat that, kin you?\u201d\n\nThey exhorted him for his own protection to stop and call his four\nhundred an ample winning. He appeared to ponder it, and then blurted:\n\u201cBut what\u2019s a feller to do when he\u2019s out on the fust vacation he\u2019s had\nfor more\u2019n forty year, if he can\u2019t play a few keerds--huh? Here! Tell\nyou what me\u2019ll and you\u2019ll do! We\u2019ll go in and play penny ante and cut\nthem fellers out. What say?\u201d\n\nThe partners flatly refused this proffered amusement, remembering that\nMr. Cochran would have them completely at the mercy of his interminable,\nunquenchable drawl. Anxious as they were to protect him, they thought\nthe price in self-sacrifice too great, and found difficulty enough, as\nit was, to finally shake him off.\n\nSomething went amiss in the engine room, and for a couple of hours the\nsteamer hove to, lolling gently, on a gentle sea. It was conducive to\nsleep, although rendering it certain that their landing in San Francisco\nmust be made late at night. The partners were awakened by the supper\ngong and on arriving at the table discovered that not only Lucky\nCochran, but the two card sharps, were not to be seen. Nor did they\nappear in the smoke room afterward, and as the hours passed, the\npartners began to be apprehensive. They made inquiries of the deck\nsteward, and learned that he had served sandwiches and coffee to three\ngentlemen who were now playing cards in one of the deck cabins, which he\npointed out, and the partners promptly retired to the rail in wrath and\ndisgust.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m through!\u201d declared David. \u201cLet \u2019em trim him for all I care.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat goes for me, too,\u201d Goliath snorted.\n\nLights became visible, and passengers crowded the decks waiting for the\nfirst big spread of glowing points that would open out after the ship\nhad rounded the Golden Gate. Luggage had all been packed and stewards\nwere bringing out and heaping up piles of traveling impedimenta. And\nthen what the partners had expected, happened. A very gloomy man came\nthrough the crowd, stumbled into contact with them, and said: \u201cWell,\nwhat do you think of that! You was right about them two fellers bein\u2019\nregular cheaters and crooks!\u201d\n\n\u201cGot you, did they?\u201d David inquired sarcastically. \u201cWell, it\u2019s your own\nfault. We did all we could to pry you loose from \u2019em, and it serves you\ndarned well right.\u201d\n\n\u201cYep. And the fact is if you hadn\u2019t talked so much they\u2019d never have\ngone after you the way they did,\u201d Goliath added. \u201cDid they get all that\ntwenty thousand dollars you was blowin\u2019 about?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot all of it,\u201d said Cochran dolefully. \u201cI got enough to get back home\non, anyhow. My luck didn\u2019t altogether leave me, but--\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only thing for you to do is to go and get a cop the minute the boat\nlands, and nail \u2019em!\u201d David declared.\n\n\u201cI reckon maybe they\u2019d fork over, if you did that,\u201d Goliath seconded.\n\n\u201cThink so?\u201d said Cochran hopefully. \u201cBut--how in tarnation can we keep\n\u2019em here till I find a cop?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll keep \u2019em for you, all right,\u201d growled Goliath. \u201cYou be the first\none off that gangplank when she goes down, and get a hustle on you. And\nmind this--that if it\u2019d been a square game me and my pardner wouldn\u2019t\nturn a hand to help you, because--we both hates a squealer. It\u2019s only\nbecause you\u2019re such a dam old simpleton that we do anything at all.\nMaybe this\u2019ll teach you a lesson!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will! It will!\u201d groaned the now \u201cunlucky\u201d Cochran, with great\nhumility. \u201cBut--but--how you goin\u2019 to hold \u2019em aboard this here ship?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re goin\u2019 to horn into their cabin with a gun and just naturally keep\n\u2019em there,\u201d said David as the plan slipped into his agile mind.\n\n\u201cBy gosh! That\u2019ll be good!\u201d Cochran gleefully chortled. \u201cMe for the head\nof that gangplank!\u201d\n\nDavid and Goliath stationed themselves outside the cabin door of the two\nsharpers and waited. They seemed to be in no hurry. Indeed, from the few\nsounds that could be overheard from within, they were indulging in a hot\naltercation and mutual recriminations.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re fightin\u2019 over the split, I got an idea,\u201d David mumbled to his\npartner.\n\n\u201cLet \u2019em fight! Saves us trouble,\u201d said Goliath.\n\nThe gangplank fell and the passengers began to pass away, in an orderly\nprocession, before the cabin door opened, and the first of the sharks\nappeared. Instantly he was confronted by a determined little red-headed\nman, who said: \u201cJust a minute. I want to talk to you two fellers. We\u2019ll\njust step inside, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\nWith an oath of surprise the man fell back, and both Goliath and David\nentered, and closed the door behind them.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to wait here a few minutes. It won\u2019t be long,\u201d David\nremarked in a voice that forbade any light reply. \u201cYou might as well sit\ndown and take it cool--unless you\u2019re lookin\u2019 for trouble.\u201d\n\nThe card sharpers looked at each other helplessly, and, quite evidently\nbelieving themselves held up by officers of the law for some of their\nmisdeeds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in for it, Crump!\u201d one of them growled at the other.\n\n\u201cYou sure are, and the less you have to say the better it\u2019ll be for\nyou,\u201d David announced sharply. Whereupon the evil pair settled\ndisconsolately to the edges of the lower berth and stared at their\ncaptors.\n\n\u201cGoliath, keep an eye out of the door for the cop and call him this\nway,\u201d said David, still acting as master of ceremonies.\n\nThe two crooks scowled apprehensively, and one of them inquired\nsavagely: \u201cYou might at least tell us what it\u2019s all about?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find that out soon enough,\u201d David snapped back at him, after\nwhich there was no further conversation, while outside the shuffling of\nfeet began to diminish, the running of porters slowed down to mere\nwalking strides, and the voices of officers could be heard calling to\none another. In the doorway Goliath\u2019s broad back began to twist this way\nand that, and with an impatient \u201cHumph! Wonder if that boob\u2019s got lost?\u201d\nhe disappeared. The wait continued, and sounds indicated that the very\nlast of the passengers had departed not only from the ship, but from the\ndock. David felt like expressing his impatience with the tardy Mr.\nCochran aloud, and himself looked out of the door just as Goliath\nreappeared with a man in uniform--not a policeman\u2019s garb, but that of\nthe ship\u2019s chief officer.\n\n\u201cThe mate says we can\u2019t hold these fellers here all night, but must take\n\u2019em out to the police office at the end of the docks,\u201d Goliath\nannounced. \u201cI\u2019ll get our suit cases and you can make \u2019em tote theirs,\nand we\u2019ll go.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on!\u201d David ordered his prisoners, and the chief officer scowled at\nthem as if to identify them for future reference as they descended the\ngangplank. They made their way to the little building at the end of the\nwharf, which, to their astonishment, was filled with harbor police. It\ndid seem as if Cochran must have been blind not to find it himself. A\nplain-clothes man, evidently of authority, looked up and smiled with\ngreat satisfaction and lighted eyes, as he said: \u201cHello! \u2018Crump\u2019 Smith\nand \u2018Slippery\u2019 Murdock, eh? Hope you\u2019ve got somethin\u2019 on \u2019em, this time,\nthat we can put \u2019em over for. I\u2019ve been tryin\u2019 to get the goods on them\nfor a long time now.\u201d\n\nThe disconsolate sharpers scowled like a pair of pirates and sank down\non a bench, while the detective called David into an inner office to\nquestion him. He listened to David\u2019s story and then shook his head\ndoubtfully.\n\n\u201cSomething funny about this,\u201d he said at last. \u201cThis man Cochran\u2019s been\ngone more than an hour. He\u2019s the complaining witness. We can\u2019t hold this\npair of sharks without him. Not but that I\u2019d like to, right enough. We\ncan detain \u2019em for a few hours, but no longer. You two men better go and\nsee if you can find your friend that they skinned out of his wad. If I\ndon\u2019t hear from you before morning and have to turn \u2019em loose, I\u2019ve got\na way of keepin\u2019 track of \u2019em so that we can pick \u2019em up again, when you\nfind your man. What hotel you going to stop at?\u201d\n\nHe wrote down the address David gave, and ushered him out. The partners\ncaught a nighthawk taxi and went to their hotel first, and then\ninstituted such inquiries as they could for the missing Mr. Cochran--all\nwithout success. Alarmed over his disappearance, and fearing that ill\nhad befallen him, they arose, after a few hours\u2019 sleep, prepared to\nresume their philanthropic quest. They pictured him as having wandered\noff the dock and having been sandbagged. They feared he might have\nfallen even into more merciless hands than those of the two callous\ncrooks who had rooked him aboard the steamer. They recalled tales of\ndoping, of shanghaiing, of murders done on the Barbary Coast, and dead\nmen thrown into the bay. They forgot the boredom of his gabbling tongue,\nhis tiresome and unquenchable garrulity, and remembered only that he was\na simple and unsophisticated old fellow who had shown a touching and\nhomely liberality to a derelict whom he had accidentally met. As their\napprehensions increased, so did their sense of helplessness.\n\n\u201cThe only thing left for us to do,\u201d said David wisely, \u201cis to go down to\nthe harbor police and see if they\u2019ve learned anything about what became\nof him.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d said Goliath. \u201cAnd if they ain\u2019t, don\u2019t you reckon we ought to\nkind of stir \u2019em up by offerin\u2019 a reward or somethin\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure! We can\u2019t balk at blowin\u2019 in a little money for that poor old\ncuss. I reckon we\u2019re the only friends he\u2019s got in this whole blamed town\nto look after him and help him out. But-- By the great horn spoon! He\nought to be in an orphan asylum or hire a guardian, I reckon.\u201d\n\nGlum with anxiety they boarded a Market Street car and rode to the\nferry. Glum with anxiety they trudged from there to the police office\nand, glum with anxiety they entered. The same plain-clothes man they had\ninterviewed in the night lowered a paper he had been reading, looked at\nthem, recognized them, and grinned.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he inquired pleasantly, \u201cdid you find your man Cochran? No?\nHumph! Guess you didn\u2019t; but I did!\u201d\n\nAnd then, as if unable to restrain himself, he indulged in a great\nlaugh.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d he declared, again looking up at their amazed faces, \u201cis one of\nthe best jokes that\u2019s blown along the water front for the past year. Sit\ndown and have a smoke. Tell you about it.\u201d\n\nThe partners subsided limply into two worn and shiny old chairs and\ngravely eyed him.\n\n\u201cOne time,\u201d he said, as if to give his story a true narrative flavor,\n\u201cthere was two of the slickest crooks and card sharks who ever flimmed a\nmutt, sailed on a ship. They\u2019d done it before--lots of times, and got\naway with many a hick\u2019s vacation money. That\u2019s Crump Smith and Slippery\nMurdock. They pick up a rube calling himself Lucky Cochran. Regular\nbackwoods goat. Moss on his back an inch thick. Hay in his whiskers.\nBirds\u2019 nests in his hair. Nice old man that talks all about himself\nevery time he can get any one to listen long enough. Funny old cuss with\na sense of humor. Some of the time he\u2019s been in Texas. Some of the time,\nmind you. For--say--the last five or six years.\n\n\u201cThis pair of slick guys set out to do him until a busted and dried\nbladder would look bigger than a circus tent in comparison with what\nhe\u2019ll be like when they get through with him. Now, what I guess is that\nthis fine old gentleman thought that he\u2019d found a couple of miners who\nwere worth lookin\u2019 after and so hung on to them; but when they didn\u2019t\nprove worth his while, he grins to himself and says, \u2018I\u2019ll devote a few\nidle hours to this pair of smart Alecks that are cruising the seas of\nadventure, because it\u2019s a rule of mine to make somebody else pay my\ntraveling expenses.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe stopped, grinned again, threw his paper to one side, and, lowering\none leg that had been crossed over the other, leaned toward them.\n\n\u201cSettling down to business, and all fooling aside,\u201d he said with an\nabrupt change to seriousness, \u201cthe man you knew as Lucky Cochran, the\nrancher, is nobody but \u2018Peerless\u2019 Carfield, the sharpest, cleverest,\ncoolest, shrewdest man who ever skinned a sucker and then sympathized\nwith him over his loss. He\u2019d gamble with a rabbit for its winter\u2019s nest.\nThe only thing that\u2019s to his credit is that he\u2019d most likely hand it\nback after he\u2019d won it. He\u2019d win a squatter\u2019s farm, and then, if he\nwasn\u2019t short himself, hand it back to the squat, and tell him how to\nclear the title.\n\n\u201cNobody can put anything across with him. He\u2019s had \u2019em all, from New\nYork to New South Wales, and from London to Lima. Crump Smith and\nSlippery Murdock were a pair of infants in his mitts. He won everything\nthey had, from their bank roll down to their shoe buttons, and then,\njust as a joke, left \u2019em hung up with you two standin\u2019 guard over \u2019em\nwhen he got off the boat and grabbed a taxicab for the most expensive\nhotel in this town, and rode away.\n\n\u201cSorry for him, were you? Well, you needn\u2019t be sorry any more. He\u2019s most\nlikely forgotten all about you two by now, and is living up at the most\nswell hotel in this town, in a suite of rooms for which he pays about\nfifty bucks a day; same rooms that a Russian prince had a year or two\nago. If you\u2019ve got sympathy to waste you\u2019d better hang some of it on to\nCrump Smith and Slippery Murdock; because if skins were overcoats and\nthis was nothing but mid-summer, they\u2019d shiver in the wind.\u201d\n\nThe partners, in a daze, got up and walked outside. The docks were busy.\nMasts showed here and there against the sky line. Teamsters drove\nstraining horses hauling highly piled wagons into the caverns, and the\nrumble of hoofs and wheels echoed like a song of export in the morning\nair. The screech of a hundred steam winches told of cargoes being\nlowered into holds. Off toward the ferry nave the clanging of street\ncars joined ragged symphony. The giant looked away toward the north, as\nif scenting forests and mountains and cabins, and then said, \u201cHumph! So\nthat\u2019s that! We\u2019re always buttin\u2019 into somethin\u2019 that ain\u2019t worth while.\nAnd--we thought he was the man that talked too much, and didn\u2019t sabe how\nto take care of himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s me and you that ought to have a nurse leadin\u2019 us by the ears,\u201d\nDavid replied, then paused, seemed to quest for some excuse, and then\nscowled upward at his stalwart and time-tried partner, and said\nadmonishingly: \u201cGoliath, you\u2019re all right; but--but--it\u2019s you that talks\ntoo damn much!\u201d\n\nAnd Goliath, whose habitual conversation consisted of a mere \u201cyes\u201d or\n\u201cno\u201d cogitated with the utmost seriousness, pondered as if reviewing all\nthe words he had ever uttered, remembering them all, and uttered a long\nspeech. He blinked, wet his lips with his tongue, hesitated, and then\nvery gravely said, \u201cYep!\u201d\n\n                                THE END",
