True, our  little parlor is\ncomfortable, especially here, where  the old man sits in his old\narm-chair; but on  Thanksgiving night the blaze should dance high up the\nchimney, and send a shower of sparks into the  outer darkness.  Toss\non an armful of those dry oak chips, the last relics of the Mermaid's\nknee-timbers, the bones of your namesake, Susan.  Higher yet, and\nclearer  be the blaze, till our cottage windows glow the ruddiest in\nthe village, and the light of our household mirth  flash far across\nthe bay to Nahant.  And now, come,  Susan, come, my children, draw\nyour chairs round me,  all of you.  There is a dimness over your\nfigures!  You  sit quivering indistinctly with each motion of the\nblaze,  which eddies about you like a flood, so that you all have  the\nlook of visions, or people that dwell only in the fire  light, and\nwill vanish from existence, as completely as  your own shadows, when\nthe flame shall sink among  the embers.  Hark!  let me listen for the\nswell of the  surf; it should be audible a mile inland, on a night\nlike  this.  Yes; there I catch the sound, but only an uncertain\nmurmur, as if a good way down over the beach; though, by the almanac,\nit is high tide at eight o'clock, and the billows must now be dashing\nwithin thirty yards of our door.  Ah! the old man's ears are failing\nhim; and so is his eyesight, and perhaps his mind; else you would not\nall be so shadowy, in the blaze of his Thanksgiving fire.\n\nHow strangely the Past is peeping over the shoulders of the Present!\nTo judge by my recollections, it is but a few moments since I sat in\nanother room; yonder model of a vessel was not there, nor the old\nchest of drawers, nor Susan's profile and mine, in that gilt frame;\nnothing, in short, except this same fire, which glimmered on books,\npapers, and a picture, and half discovered my solitary figure in a\nlooking-glass.  But it was paler than my rugged old self, and younger,\ntoo, by almost half a century.  Speak to me, Susan; speak, my beloved\nones; for the scene is glimmering on my sight again, and as it\nbrightens you fade away.  O, I should be loath to lose my treasure of\npast happiness, and become once more what I was then; a hermit in the\ndepths of my own mind; sometimes yawning over drowsy volumes, and anon\na scribbler of wearier trash than what I read; a man who had wandered\nout of the real world and got into its shadow, where his troubles,\njoys, and vicissitudes were of such slight stuff, that he hardly knew\nwhether he lived, or only dreamed of living. Thank Heaven, I am an old\nman now, and have done with all such vanities!\n\nStill this dimness of mine eyes!  Come nearer, Susan, and stand before\nthe fullest blaze of the hearth.  Now I behold you illuminated from\nhead to foot, in your clean cap and decent gown, with the dear lock of\ngray hair across your forehead, and a quiet smile about your mouth,\nwhile the eyes alone are concealed, by the red gleam of the fire upon\nyour spectacles.  There, you made me tremble again!  When the flame\nquivered, my sweet Susan, you quivered with it, and grew indistinct,\nas if melting into the warm light, that my last glimpse of you might\nbe as visionary as the first was, full many a year since.  Do you\nremember it?  You stood on the little bridge, over the brook, that\nruns across King's Beach into the sea.  It was twilight; the waves\nrolling in, the wind sweeping by, the crimson clouds fading in the\nwest, and the silver moon brightening above the hill; and on the\nbridge were you, fluttering in the breeze like a sea-bird that might\nskim away at your pleasure.  You seemed a daughter of the viewless\nwind, a creature of the ocean foam and the crimson light, whose merry\nlife was spent in dancing on the crests of the billows, that threw up\ntheir spray to support your footsteps.  As I drew nearer, I fancied\nyou akin to the race of mermaids, and thought how pleasant it would be\nto dwell with you among the quiet coves, in the shadow of the cliffs,\nand to roam along secluded beaches of the purest sand, and when our\nnorthern shores grew bleak, to haunt the islands, green and lonely,\nfar amid summer seas.  And yet it gladdened me, after all this\nnonsense, to find you nothing but a pretty young girl, sadly perplexed\nwith the rude behavior of the wind about your petticoats.\n\nThus I did with Susan as with most other things in my earlier days,\ndipping her image into my mind and coloring it of a thousand fantastic\nhues, before I could see her as she really was.  Now, Susan, for a\nsober picture of our village!  It was a small collection of dwellings\nthat seemed to have been cast up by the sea, with the rock-weed and\nmarine plants that it vomits after a storm, or to have come ashore\namong the pipe-staves and other lumber, which had been washed from the\ndeck of an Eastern schooner.  There was just space for the narrow and\nsandy street between the beach in front, and a precipitous hill that\nlifted its rocky forehead in the rear, among a waste of juniper-bushes\nand the wild growth of a broken pasture.  The village was picturesque,\nin the variety of its edifices, though all were rude.  Here stood a\nlittle old hovel, built, perhaps, of drift-wood, there a row of\nboat-houses, and beyond them a two-story dwelling, of dark and\nweather-beaten aspect, the whole intermixed with one or two snug cottages,\npainted white, a sufficiency of pigsties, and a shoemaker's shop.  Two\ngrocery-stores stand opposite each other, in the centre of the\nvillage.  These were the places of resort, at their idle hours, of a\nhardy throng of fishermen, in red baize shirts, oilcloth trousers, and\nboots of brown leather covering the whole leg; true seven-league\nboots, but fitter to wade the ocean than walk the earth.  The wearers\nseemed amphibious, as if they did but creep out of salt water to sun\nthemselves; nor would it have been wonderful to see their lower limbs\ncovered with clusters of little shellfish, such as cling to rocks and\nold ship-timber over which the tide ebbs and flows.  When their fleet\nof boats was weather-bound, the butchers raised their price, and the\nspit was busier than the frying-pan; for this was a place of fish, and\nknown as such, to all the country round about; the very air was fishy,\nbeing perfumed with dead sculpins, hardheads, and dogfish, strewn\nplentifully on the beach.  You see, children, the village is but\nlittle changed, since your mother and I were young.\n\nHow like a dream it was, when I bent over a pool of water, one\npleasant morning, and saw that the ocean had dashed its spray over me\nand made me a fisherman!  There were the tarpauling, the baize shirt,\nthe oil-cloth trousers and seven-league boots, and there my own\nfeatures, but so reddened with sunburn and sea-breezes, that methought\nI had another face, and on other shoulders too.  The sea-gulls and the\nloons, and I, had now all one trade; we skimmed the crested waves and\nsought our prey beneath them, the man with as keen enjoyment as the\nbirds. Always, when the east grew purple, I launched my dory, my\nlittle flat-bottomed skiff, and rowed cross-handed to Point Ledge, the\nMiddle Ledge, or, perhaps, beyond Egg Rock; often, too, did I anchor\noff Dread Ledge, a spot of peril to ships unpiloted; and sometimes\nspread an adventurous sail and tracked across the bay to South Shore,\ncasting my lines in sight of Scituate.  Ere nightfall, I hauled my\nskiff high and dry on the beach, laden with red rock-cod, or the\nwhite-bellied ones of deep water; haddock, bearing the black marks of\nSt. Peter's fingers near the gills; the longbearded hake, whose liver\nholds oil enough for a midnight lamp; and now and then a mighty\nhalibut, with a back broad as my boat.  In the autumn, I trolled and\ncaught those lovely fish, the mackerel.  When the wind was high,--when\nthe whale-boats, anchored off the Point, nodded their slender masts at\neach other, and the dories pitched and tossed in the surf,--when\nNahant Beach was thundering three miles off, and the spray broke a\nhundred feet in air, round the distant base of Egg Rock,--when the\nbrimful and boisterous sea threatened to tumble over the street of our\nvillage,--then I made a holiday on shore.\n\nMany such a day did I sit snugly in Mr. Bartlett's store, attentive to\nthe yarns of Uncle Parker; uncle to the whole village, by right of\nseniority, but of Southern blood, with no kindred in New England.  His\nfigure is before me now, enthroned upon a mackerel-barrel; a lean old\nman, of great height, but bent with years, and twisted into an uncouth\nshape by seven broken limbs; furrowed also, and weather-worn, as if\nevery gale, for the better part of a century, had caught him somewhere\non the sea. He looked like a harbinger of tempest, a shipmate of the\nFlying Dutchman.  After innumerable voyages aboard men-of-war and\nmerchant-men, fishing-schooners and chebacco-boats, the old salt had\nbecome master of a handcart, which he daily trundled about the\nvicinity, and sometimes blew his fish-horn through the streets of\nSalem.  One of Uncle Parker's eyes had been blown out with gunpowder,\nand the other did but glimmer in its socket. Turning it upward as he\nspoke, it was his delight to tell of cruises against the French, and\nbattles with his own shipmates, when he and an antagonist used to be\nseated astride of a sailor's chest, each fastened down by a spike-nail\nthrough his trousers, and there to fight it out.  Sometimes he\nexpatiated on the delicious flavor of the liagden, a greasy and\ngoose-like fowl, which the sailors catch with hook and line on the Grand\nBanks. He dwelt with rapture on an interminable winter at the Isle of\nSables, where he had gladdened himself, amid polar snows, with the rum\nand sugar saved from the wreck of a West India schooner. And\nwrathfully did he shake his fist, as he related how a party of Cape\nCod men had robbed him and his companions of their lawful spoil, and\nsailed away with every keg of old Jamaica, leaving him not a drop to\ndrown his sorrow.  Villains they were, and of that wicked brotherhood\nwho are said to tie lanterns to horses' tails, to mislead the mariner\nalong the dangerous shores of the Cape.\n\nEven now I seem to see the group of fishermen, with that old salt in\nthe midst.  One fellow sits on the counter, a second bestrides an\noil-barrel, a third lolls at his length on a parcel of new cod-lines, and\nanother has planted the tarry seat of his trousers on a heap of salt,\nwhich will shortly be sprinkled over a lot of fish.  They are a likely\nset of men.  Some have voyaged to the East Indies or the Pacific, and\nmost of them have sailed in Marblehead schooners to Newfoundland; a\nfew have been no farther than the Middle Banks, and one or two have\nalways fished along the shore; but, as Uncle Parker used to say, they\nhave all been christened in salt water, and know more than men ever\nlearn in the bushes.  A curious figure, by way of contrast, is a\nfish-dealer from farup country, listening with eyes wide open to\nnarratives that might startle Sindbad the sailor.  Be it well with you,\nmy brethren!  Ye are all gone, some to your graves ashore, and others\nto the depths of ocean; but my faith is strong that ye are happy; for\nwhenever I behold your forms, whether in dream or vision, each\ndeparted friend is puffing his long-nine, and a mug of the right\nblackstrap goes round from lip to lip.\n\nBut where was the mermaid in those delightful times?  At a certain\nwindow near the centre of the village appeared a pretty display of\ngingerbread men and horses, picture-books and ballads, small\nfish-hooks, pins, needles, sugar-plums, and brass thimbles, articles on\nwhich the young fishermen used to expend their money from pure\ngallantry.  What a picture was Susan behind the counter!  A slender\nmaiden, though the child of rugged parents, she had the slimmest of\nall waists, brown hair curling on her neck, and a complexion rather\npale, except when the sea-breeze flushed it.  A few freckles became\nbeauty-spots beneath her eyelids.  How was it, Susan, that you talked\nand acted so carelessly, yet always for the best, doing whatever was\nright in your own eyes, and never once doing wrong in mine, nor\nshocked a taste that had been morbidly sensitive till now?  And whence\nhad you that happiest gift, of brightening every topic with an\nunsought gayety, quiet but irresistible, so that even loomy spirits\nfelt your sunshine, and did not shrink from it?  Nature wrought the\ncharm.  She made you a frank, simple, kind-hearted, sensible, and\nmirthful girl.  Obeying nature, you did free things without\nindelicacy, displayed a maiden's thoughts to every eye, and proved\nyourself as innocent as naked Eve.\n\nIt was beautiful to observe, how her simple and happy nature mingled\nitself with mine.  She kindled a domestic fire within my heart, and\ntook up her dwelling there, even in that chill and lonesome cavern\nhung round with glittering icicles of fancy.  She gave me warmth of\nfeeling, while the influence of my mind made her contemplative.  I\ntaught her to love the moonlight hour, when the expanse of the\nencircled bay was smooth as a great mirror and slept in a transparent\nshadow; while beyond Nahant, the wind rippled the dim ocean into a\ndreamy brightness, which grew faint afar off, without becoming\ngloomier.  I held her hand and pointed to the long surf wave, as it\nrolled calmly on the beach, in an unbroken line of silver; we were\nsilent together, till its deep and peaceful murmur had swept by us.\nWhen the Sabbath sun shone down into the recesses of the cliffs, I led\nthe mermaid thither, and told her that those huge, gray, shattered\nrocks, and her native sea, that raged forever like a storm against\nthem, and her own slender beauty, in so stern a scene, were all\ncombined into a strain of poetry.  But on the Sabbath eve, when her\nmother had gone early to bed, and her gentle sister had smiled and\nleft us, as we sat alone by the quiet hearth, with household things\naround, it was her turn to make me feel that here was a deeper poetry,\nand that this was the dearest hour of all.  Thus went on our wooing,\ntill I had shot wild-fowl enough to feather our bridal bed, and the\nDaughter of the Sea was mine.\n\nI built a cottage for Susan and myself, and made a gateway in the form\nof a Gothic arch, by setting up a whale's jaw-bones.  We bought a\nheifer with her first calf, and had a little garden on the hillside,\nto supply us with potatoes and green sauce for our fish.  Our parlor\nsmall and neat, was ornamented with our two profiles in one gilt\nframe, and with shells and pretty pebbles on the mantel-piece,\nselected from the sea's treasury of such things, on Nahant Beach.  On\nthe desk, beneath the looking-glass, lay the Bible, which I had begun\nto read aloud at the Book of Genesis, and the singing-book that Susan\nused for her evening psalm.  Except the almanac, we had no other\nliterature.  All that I heard of books, was when an Indian history, or\ntale of shipwreck, was sold by a peddler or wandering subscription-man,\nto some one in the village, and read through its owner's nose to a\nslumberous auditory.  Like my brother fishermen, I grew into the\nbelief that all human erudition was collected in our pedagogue, whose\ngreen spectacles and solemn phiz, as he passed to his little schoolhouse,\namid a waste of sand, might have gained him a diploma from any\ncollege in New England.  In truth I dreaded him.  When our children\nwere old enough to claim his care, you remember, Susan, how I frowned,\nthough you were pleased, at this learned man's encomiums on their\nproficiency.  I feared to trust them even with the alphabet; it was\nthe key to a fatal treasure.\n\nBut I loved to lead them by their little hands along the beach, and\npoint to nature in the vast and the minute, the sky, the sea, the\ngreen earth, the pebbles, and the shells.  Then did I discourse of the\nmighty works and coextensive goodness of the Deity, with the simple\nwisdom of a man whose mind had profited by lonely days upon the deep,\nand his heart by the strong and pure affections of his evening home.\nSometimes my voice lost itself in a tremulous depth; for I felt His\neye upon me as I spoke. Once, while my wife and all of us were gazing\nat ourselves, in the mirror left by the tide in a hollow of the sand,\nI pointed to the pictured heaven below, and bade her observe how\nreligion was strewn everywhere in our path; since even a casual pool\nof water recalled the idea of that home whither we were travelling, to\nrest forever with our children.  Suddenly, your image, Susan, and all\nthe little faces made up of yours and mine, seemed to fade away and\nvanish around me, leaving a pale visage like my own of former days\nwithin the frame of a large looking-glass.  Strange illusion!\n\nMy life glided on, the past appearing to mingle with the present and\nabsorb the future, till the whole lies before me at a glance. My\nmanhood has long been waning with a stanch decay; my earlier\ncontemporaries, after lives of unbroken health, are all at rest,\nwithout having known the weariness of later age; and now, with a\nwrinkled forehead and thin white hair as badges of my dignity, I have\nbecome the patriarch, the Uncle of the village.  I love that name; it\nwidens the circle of my sympathies; it joins all the youthful to my\nhousehold, in the kindred of affection.\n\nLike Uncle Parker, whose rheumatic bones were dashed against Egg Rock,\nfull forty years ago, I am a spinner of long yarns.  Seated on the\ngunwale of a dory, or on the sunny side of a boat-house, where the\nwarmth is grateful to my limbs, or by my own hearth, when a friend or\ntwo are there, I overflow with talk, and yet am never tedious.  With a\nbroken voice I give utterance to much wisdom.  Such, Heaven be\npraised! is the vigor of my faculties, that many a forgotten usage,\nand traditions ancient in my youth, and early adventures of myself or\nothers, hitherto effaced by things more recent, acquire new\ndistinctness in my memory.  I remember the happy days when the haddock\nwere more numerous on all the fishing-grounds than sculpins in the\nsurf; when the deepwater cod swain close in shore, and the dogfish,\nwith his poisonous horn, had not learned to take the hook.  I can\nnumber every equinoctial storm, in which the sea has overwhelmed the\nstreet, flooded the cellars of the village, and hissed upon our\nkitchen hearth.  I give the history of the great whale that was landed\non Whale Beach, and whose jaws, being now my gateway, will last for\nages after my coffin shall have passed beneath them. Thence it is an\neasy digression to the halibut, scarcely smaller than the whale, which\nran out six cod-lines, and hauled my dory to the mouth of Boston\nHarbor, before I could touch him with the gaff.\n\nIf melancholy accidents be the theme of conversation, I tell how a\nfriend of mine was taken out of his boat by an enormous shark; and the\nsad, true tale of a young man on the eve of marriage, who had been\nnine days missing, when his drowned body floated into the very\npathway, on Marblehead Neck, that had often led him to the dwelling of\nhis bride; as if the dripping corpse would have come where the mourner\nwas.  With such awful fidelity did that lover return to fulfil his\nvows!  Another favorite story is of a crazy maiden, who conversed with\nangels and had the gift of prophecy, and whom all the village loved\nand pitied, though she went from door to door accusing us of sin,\nexhorting to repentance, and foretelling our destruction by flood or\nearthquake.  If the young men boast their knowledge of the ledges and\nsunken rocks, I speak of pilots, who knew the wind by its scent and\nthe wave by its taste, and could have steered blindfold to any port\nbetween Boston and Mount Desert, guided only by the rote of the shore;\nthe peculiar sound of the surf on each island, beach, and line of\nrocks, along the coast.  Thus do I talk, and all my auditors grow\nwise, while they deem it pastime.\n\nI recollect no happier portion of my life, than this, my calm old age.\nIt is like the sunny and sheltered slope of a valley, where, late in\nthe autumn, the grass is greener than in August, and intermixed with\ngolden dandelions, that have not been seen till now, since the first\nwarmth of the year.  But with me, the verdure and the flowers are not\nfrostbitten in the midst of winter.  A playfulness has revisited my\nmind; a sympathy with the young and gay; an unpainful interest in the\nbusiness of others; a light and wandering curiosity; arising, perhaps,\nfrom the sense that my toil on earth is ended, and the brief hour till\nbedtime may be spent in play.  Still, I have fancied that there is a\ndepth of feeling and reflection, under this superficial levity,\npeculiar to one who has lived long, and is soon to die.\n\nShow me anything that would make an infant smile, and you shall behold\na gleam of mirth over the hoary ruin of my visage.  I can spend a\npleasant hour in the sun, watching the sports of the village children,\non the edge of the surf; now they chase the retreating wave far down\nover the wet sand; now it steals softly up to kiss their naked feet;\nnow it comes onward with threatening front, and roars after the\nlaughing crew, as they scamper beyond its reach.  Why should not an\nold man be merry too, when the great sea is at play with those little\nchildren?  I delight, also, to follow in the wake of a pleasure-party\nof young men and girls, strolling along the beach after an early\nsupper at the Point.  Here, with hand kerchiefs at nose, they bend\nover a heap of eel-grass, entangled in which is a dead skate, so oddly\naccoutred with two legs and a long tail, that they mistake him for a\ndrowned animal.  A few steps farther, the ladies scream, and the\ngentlemen make ready to protect them against a young shark of the\ndogfish kind, rolling with a life-like motion in the tide that has\nthrown him up.  Next, they are smit with wonder at the black shells of\na wagon-load of live lobsters, packed in rock-weed for the country\nmarket.  And when they reach the fleet of dories, just hauled ashore\nafter the day's fishing, how do I laugh in my sleeve, and sometimes\nroar outright, at the simplicity of these young folks and the sly\nhumor of the fishermen!  In winter, when our village is thrown into a\nbustle by the arrival of perhaps a score of country dealers,\nbargaining for frozen fish, to be transported hundreds of miles, and\neaten fresh in Vermont or Canada, I am a pleased but idle spectator in\nthe throng.  For I launch my boat no more.\n\nWhen the shore was solitary, I have found a pleasure that seemed even\nto exalt my mind, in observing the sports or contentions of two gulls,\nas they wheeled and hovered about each other, with hoarse screams, one\nmoment flapping on the foam of the wave, and then soaring aloft, till\ntheir white bosoms melted into the upper sunshine.  In the calm of the\nsummer sunset, I drag my aged limbs, with a little ostentation of\nactivity, because I am so old, up to the rocky brow of the hill.\nThere I see the white sails of many a vessel, outward bound or\nhomeward from afar, and the black trail of a vapor behind the eastern\nsteamboat; there, too, is the sun, going down, but not in gloom, and\nthere the illimitable ocean mingling with the sky, to remind me of\neternity.\n\nBut sweetest of all is the hour of cheerful musing and pleasant talk,\nthat comes between the dusk and the lighted candle, by my glowing\nfireside.  And never, even on the first Thanksgiving night, when Susan\nand I sat alone with our hopes, nor the second, when a stranger had\nbeen sent to gladden us, and be the visible image of our affection,\ndid I feel such joy as now.  All that belong to me are here; Death has\ntaken none, nor Disease kept them away, nor Strife divided them from\ntheir parents or each other; with neither poverty nor riches to\ndisturb them, nor the misery of desires beyond their lot, they have\nkept New England's festival round the patriarch's board.  For I am a\npatriarch! Here I sit among my descendants, in my old arm-chair and\nimmemorial corner, while the firelight throws an appropriate glory\nround my venerable frame.  Susan!  My children!  Something whispers\nme, that this happiest hour must be the final one, and that nothing\nremains but to bless you all, and depart with a treasure of\nrecollected joys to heaven.  Will you meet me there? Alas!  your\nfigures grow indistinct, fading into pictures on the air, and now to\nfainter outlines, while the fire is glimmering on the walls of a\nfamiliar room, and shows the book that I flung down, and the sheet\nthat I left half written, some fifty years ago.  I lift my eyes to the\nlooking-glass, and perceive myself alone, unless those be the\nmermaid's features, retiring into the depths of the mirror, with a\ntender and melancholy smile.\n\nAll! one feels a chillness, not bodily, but about the heart, and,\nmoreover, a foolish dread of looking behind him, after these pastimes.\nI can imagine precisely how a magician would sit down in gloom and\nterror, after dismissing the shadows that had personated dead or\ndistant people, and stripping his cavern of the unreal splendor which\nhad changed it to a palace.  And now for a moral to my revery.  Shall\nit be, that, since fancy can create so bright a dream of happiness, it\nwere better to dream on from youth to age, than to awake and strive\ndoubtfully for something real!  O, the slight tissue of a dream can no\nmore preserve us from the stern reality of misfortune, than a robe of\ncobweb could repel the wintry blast.  Be this the moral, then. In\nchaste and warm affections, humble wishes, and honest toil for some\nuseful end, there is health for the mind, and quiet for the heart, the\nprospect of a happy life, and the fairest hope of heaven.",
