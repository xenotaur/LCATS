    "body": "Doak Parker was thinking of June, when the light flashed. He was\nthinking of the two months' campaign and the very probable probability\nof his knocking her off this week-end. It was going to be a conquest\nto rank among his best. It was going to be....\n\nThe buzzer buzzed, the light flashed and the image of Ryder appeared\non his small desk-screen. Ryder said, \"Come in, Doak. A little job for\nthe week-end.\"\n\n_No_, Doak thought, _no, no, no! Not this week-end. Not this\nparticular triumphant looming week-end. No!_ He said, \"Be right\nthere, Chief.\"\n\nRyder was sitting behind his desk when Doak entered. Ryder was a man\nof about sixty, with a lined, weary face and a straggling mustache. He\nnodded at the chair across the desk from him.\n\nRyder depressed a button on his desk and the screen beyond him began\nto glow. Ryder said, \"An electronic transcript of a phone call I\nreceived this morning from former Senator Elmer Arnold. You know who\nhe is, I guess, Doak.\"\n\n\"Author of the Arnold Law?\" Doak smiled. \"Who doesn't?\"\n\nThen the image of former Senator Arnold came on the screen. He didn't\nlook any more than a hundred and ten years old, a withered and thin\nlipped man with a complexion like ashes. He began to talk.\n\n\"Ryder, I guess you know I'm no scatterbrain and I guess you know I'm\nnot one to cry wolf--but there's something damned funny going on in\nthe old Fisher place on the Range Road. You better send a man down\nhere, and I mean quick. You have him contact me.\"\n\nThe image faded, the rasping voice ceased. Doak sighed and looked at\nhis nails.\n\n\"Senile, you're thinking?\" Ryder said quietly.\n\n\"I wasn't thinking at all, Chief,\" Doak said.\n\n\"Not even about that new one, that June?\" the Chief asked, smiling.\n\nDoak looked up, startled. \"Is there no privacy? Are there no\nsanctuaries?\"\n\n\"Not from Security,\" Ryder said. \"But don't be disturbed. There's no\nlaw against _that_ yet excepting some of the old ones--and who has\ntime for the old ones?\"\n\n\"As long as we're being frank,\" Doak said, \"he mentioned the old\nFisher place and a road as though you should know them. Friends of\nyours?\"\n\n\"Friends? That's our home town. Senator Arnold was very instrumental\nin my Department climb.\" Ryder paused. \"And no crackpot.\"\n\n\"I'll buy that,\" Doak agreed. \"He was the man who first saw the power\nin combining pressure groups. He surely made some strange bedfellows.\"\n\n\"Any lobbyist would be a strange bedfellow, I've been told,\" the Chief\nanswered. \"The Arnold Law has saved us one hell of a lot of work,\nDoak, and saved the Department money.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Doak said. \"I'm to understand this couldn't be put off\nuntil Monday?\"\n\nRyder nodded.\n\n\"And no other Security Officer would do?\"\n\n\"No other.\"\n\nDoak rose. \"Anything else--_sir_?\"\n\nRyder smiled. \"Just one. As a guess, what do you think it is, in the\nold Fisher place, on the Range Road?\"\n\n\"Readers,\" Doak answered, \"or why would the--uh, Mr. Arnold be so\nworried.\"\n\nRyder chuckled. \"I can see them now, in the curtained room, huddling\nover an old railroad timetable. I think your guess is sound, Doak.\" He\nrose. \"And there'll be other week-ends. That girl can wait. She isn't\ngoing to spoil.\"\n\n\"But _I_ might explode,\" Doak said. \"Well, it will be triple-time.\nThat's some consolation. Enough for a new video set--I need one in the\nbathroom.\"\n\nIt was still a half hour to quitting time and Doak went back to his\ndesk. He sat there, trying to remember the history of Senator Arnold.\nIt was all on the tape in the Biography Center, he knew, but he didn't\nwant that much information.\n\n_Subversive_ kicked around in his memory and the phrase \"free press.\"\nAnd then he remembered the Censors. The religious, the political, the\nscientific, the capitalist, the communist, the ridiculous and the\nabsurd.\n\nArnold had unified the Censors and they had made strange bedfellows.\nFor where one bit of ink and paper might be anti-Christian, the next\nmight be anti-anti-Christian and the next anti-anti-anti--ad\nabsurdium. And sex? Where couldn't one find sex in print, even among\nthe prissy writers? For wasn't a large part of it boy meets girl? And\nthey didn't meet to exchange election buttons--that much was certain.\n\nWell, there were the P.T.A. and the N.A.M. and the fine if disguised\nhand of the Lenin lovers and the S.P.C.A. who didn't like dogs to play\na sub-human part in the world of letters. All these, fighting each\nother, until Senator Arnold came forth.\n\nThe Senator had never enjoyed a favorable press and had a habit of\nsaying things that looked silly, three years later, in print. The\nSenator was the new spokesman for the Censors.\n\nAnd those who loathed sex or Christians or Republicans or Democrats or\nthe Big Ten or the small snifter were unified under this noble man who\nread with his lips.\n\nThey were for him. And they established the biggest lobby ever to\ncrawl out of the woodwork in Washington. They had their day.\n\nThe printers fought a little but were offered jobs in Hollywood. The\npaper manufacturers were promised all the government map-work plus a\nnew sheaf of picture magazines. The publishers were all rich and ready\nto retire anyway.\n\nThe writers? They were disorganized because some were rich and some\nweren't, the game being what it was, and the difference in viewpoint\nbetween a rich and a non-rich writer makes McCarthy and Malenkov look\nlike brothers.\n\n_There shall be in that area of the galaxy under American control\nno material of a literary or non-literary, educational or\nnon-educational, pertinent or impertinent nature, which is printed,\nwritten, enscribed, engraved, mimeographed, dupligraphed,\nelectro-graved, arti-scribed, teleprinted...._\n\nThat wasn't the exact wording, but close.\n\nSimple enough--how can there be subversive literature if there is no\nliterature?\n\nThere were still sex, Democrats, Lenin lovers, some religion and two\nRepublicans (on Venus). There was, of course, no Post Office\nDepartment, nor need for any.\n\nOn Connecticut Ave (S.E.) there was a girl named June waiting for a\ncall from Doak. She had been in a negative frame of mind for two\nmonths, but the week-end ahead had shown promise of bringing matters\nto a head and maybe, considering everything, well, what the hell....\n\nDoak looked at the newsscreen over the water cooler and saw,\n_Stormy and some rain. Temp. 93. 1730._\n\nA gong sounded.\n\nThe other wage-slaves rose with assorted sighs, looking forward to the\nweek-end. Doak dialed June's number.\n\nHis outside screen lighted up and there she was, her hair in curlers\nbut luscious as a peach. \"Hi,\" she said. And then frowned at the\nseriousness of his smile.\n\n\"Look, June,\" he said, \"I--I've got to go out of town.\"\n\n\"I'll _bet_,\" she said.\n\n\"So help me, kid, it's....\" Well, he couldn't say what it was. \"I'll\nphone you, though, as soon--\"\n\nHis screen went blank. He dialed again, and again. The screen stayed\nblank.\n\nRyder came out from his office, his hat on, looking weary. He managed\na smile for Doak. \"You'd better get to the cashier before he closes,\nif you haven't already.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Doak said. \"Dubbinville, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Dubbinville,\" Ryder said. \"My old Wisconsin home. You'll find it\nbeautiful this time of the year. You'll love it, Doak.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Doak said.\n\nThe cashier was just getting ready to close when Doak came to the\nwindow. \"Week-end trip,\" Doak said. \"Secret.\"\n\n\"How much?\"\n\nDoak faced him squarely. \"Two thousand.\"\n\nThe cashier seemed to wince but Doak's gaze didn't relent. He was only\nthree years behind in his taxes now and this extra moola on the\nswindle-sheet could bring him two months closer. Anyone who was only\ntwo years behind on his taxes was considered a very solid citizen.\n\nThe cashier reached down to pull up four packets of twenties. \"Well,\"\nhe said quietly, \"it's not _my_ money.\" He tossed the two thousand out\nto Doak and yawned. \"Remind me about it Monday if I forget, will you?\nI'm not much good the end of the week.\"\n\n_Or any other part of the week_, Doak thought. He said, \"If I'm back,\nMonday. If I'm not I'll scream for more.\"\n\n\"You do that well,\" the cashier said and reached up to turn off the\nlight overhead.\n\nIt was hot outside. The sun seemed to be imprisoned in the white\ncorridor that stretched for miles between the government buildings and\nthe ashment of the parking lot glittered like broken glass.\n\n\n\nFrom the mines of Mars the ashment came, the best paving surface known\nto man. And what was Mars but mines? With all their grand talk, who\nwanted to leave Mother Earth? What was Venus but a sanctuary, a\nvacation spot, and what was Mars but mines? When a big cog like the\nChief could send a lonely man all the way to Dubbinville because of a\nneighbor's summons, how could they expect little cogs to grow up to\ngalactic thinking?\n\nDubbinville and the heat of a Wisconsin summer--and June waiting in\nthe apartment on Connecticut (S.E.). Doak swore quietly and\nthoroughly and stepped into the oven that was his Chev.\n\nThe cooling system started with the motor and the interior was\ncomfortable by the time he pulled into the stream of home-bound\ntraffic. It was a fourteen-lane highway and jammed to the curbs.\n\n\n\nThere were only two signals in eight miles but traffic moved in fits\nand starts at this time of day. He could see the first light when he\nwas a hundred yards from it and was sure he could make it.\n\nBut it turned amber when he was still fifteen yards from the corner\nand the force-field actuated his traffic-servant and he heard the\nbrake control click. Well, it avoided accidents but it sure as hell\nwas rough on brake linings. He skidded to a stop.\n\nCars, cars, cars for miles. And the glittering ashment and all the\nboys and gals going home to plot the week-end. No magazines, no books,\nno papers with their social columns, so the girls would be out and\nlooking around.\n\nAnd the men would be out and looking around and what more did you\nneed?\n\nThe light changed and his brake was released and he moved out at the\nhead of his line, thinking about Dubbinville, trying to imagine it,\nsome hamlet tucked away in a Wisconsin hill, dreaming of yesterday.\nGreat, fine, dandy!\n\nIn his apartment all his video sets yammered at him and he stopped in\nthe doorway, staring. They should have turned off when he'd thrown the\nmaster switch this morning.\n\nIn the hallway, he checked the switch, and it read _off_. Must be\nshorted....\n\nHe went from dinette to kitchen to bedroom to living room, turning off\neach set individually. All of them had the same program, Milton Berle\nIV. He liked that better than wrestling though not much.\n\nIn his chrome and plastic kitchen he dialed June's number.\n\nHer hair wasn't in the curlers. It was golden and braided and high on\nher classic head. She said, \"Your picture isn't coming through. Who is\nthis, please?\"\n\nDoak said in a falsetto, \"Guess.\"\n\nThe screen went blank.\n\nDoak snapped the video switch to _on_ and dialed Lateral-American. A\nbrunette with vivid blue eyes came into view.\n\n\"A priority to Dubbinville, Wisconsin, first trip possible,\" Doak said\nand gave her Security's code number.\n\n\"Dubbinville?\" she said and frowned. She consulted a station box out\nof his view and looked up again. \"You'll have to take surface\ntransportation from Milwaukee. It's only about twenty miles from there\nin Waukesha County.\"\n\n\"Good enough. And when's the first to Milwaukee?\"\n\n\"At nineteen hundred, ramp eighty-seven. Kindly pick up your ticket at\nBooth sixty-two.\" The screen went blank.\n\nThe ticket wasn't really though the name had persisted. The 'ticket'\nwas a coin. Doak looked in his refrigerator and there was nothing\nworthwhile in there. He'd eat at the airport.\n\nHe looked at the phone and decided against it. He went into the\nbedroom and threw some shirts and socks and a pair of clean pajamas\ninto his durapelt bag.\n\nDubbinville--and June out looking around. What a lousy deal!\n\n\nII\n\nThe great ship lay sleekly quiet under the slanting sun, the\npassengers like ants measured against its giant hull. Clink, clink,\nclink went the coins into the counting box, the light over each seat\ngoing on with the clink of the coin.\n\nThen they were seated, the lights all on, and the tractor was pulling\nthe giant to the channelled runway, guarded by the blast walls.\n\n_Milwaukee, here I come._\n\nThe whirr of the rolling wheels, the reverberations from the blast\nwalls, a crescendo of sound, and they were free of earth. An\naccelerating, effortless flight, a faint tremor as they passed the\nsonic barrier, then no sensory impressions at all.\n\nFlight as free as the wind's passage but more silent. Through the\nvisacrys windows a blur of blue-green. Speed without strain, power\nwithout tumult.\n\nDoak relaxed and for the first time since the Chief's summons he\nwasn't thinking of June. He was thinking of Man, from the cave to\nVenus, from the wheel to free flight. And something out of his\nchildhood memory came to mind.\n\n    _Studious let me sit_\n    _And hold high converse with the mighty dead_\n\nWhere had he heard that? Some Scotch poet, it must have been, for his\nmother recited only the Scotch poets. _Studious let me sit_--in front\nof a video set, to watch the wrestling?\n\n_And hold high converse with the mighty dead_--not in this world where\nthere was only tomorrow, not in this world of no books. There were no\nwriters on television--they had no need to attract an audience. They\n_had_ an audience. An audience that would watch wrestling would watch\nanything.\n\nSo the ad men took over the duties of the semi-writers who had\nprepared the radio programs. Ad men offended nobody, even those with\ndenture breath. That could be cured and so could acne, B.O., straight\nhair and seam squirrels.\n\n_Hey!_ he though suddenly. _Watch where you're thinking, Doak Parker._\n\nA government man, a Security Officer, he straightened in his seat as\nthe stewardess came along the aisle.\n\nShe smiled at him, \"Everything all right, Mr. Parker?\"\n\n\"Dandy,\" Doak said. \"Great, fine! Why?\"\n\nShe paused, disconcerted \"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't everything be all right? Lateral-American, the skyway\nto the stars, right?\"\n\nShe smiled \"Absolutely correct.\"\n\n\"_And_ Milwaukee,\" Doak added. \"Do you only handle the earth runs?\"\n\n\"Until next year,\" she said. \"I'm new.\"\n\n\"I'm old,\" Doak said. \"Is there anything to drink on board?\"\n\n\"Water, Mr. Parker.\"\n\n\"I'm not _that_ old,\" he said.\n\nShe glanced at her watch. \"We'll be in Milwaukee in six minutes. And\nthat's the beer town.\"\n\nBut he had no time for a glass of beer. The limousine took him to the\nelevated station and the last car for Dubbinville was leaving in three\nminutes.\n\nIt was a nine-minute trip. He'd picked up an hour, coming west, and\nused but thirty-three minutes. It was still only seven o'clock when\nthe huge elevated car hissed to a stop in front of the Dubbinville\nstation.\n\nThere was a smell to the place, a smell of sun-warmed grass and fruit\nblossoms, of lilacs and quiet rains. Doak stood on the platform,\nsurveying the winding main street leading up into the gentle hills.\nPeople on porches and teenagers in front of the drugstore. A\nreddish-brown setter padded past on some secret business of his own.\n\nThere was no whiz, no whir, no clank, no squeal, no grind. This was\nDubbinville, U.S.A.\n\nThe station agent was picking up a pair of film boxes, as Doak walked\nover. He smiled at Doak. \"Beautiful evening, isn't it?\"\n\n\"It certainly is. Is there--a place to stay in town, a hotel?\"\n\nThe station agent shook his head. \"No hotel. But you could stay at\nMrs. Klein's. She takes in boarders.\" He pointed with a bony\nforefinger. \"That grey house with the blue shutters, right on the\ncurve there.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Doak said. \"What's the population here?\"\n\n\"Around eight hundred, last census, though we had a couple families\nmove in since then. Hasn't changed much the last hundred years.\"\n\n\"Retired farmers, mostly?\" Doak asked.\n\n\"Mmmm, I guess. Just--people.\"\n\nPeople.... Which meant nothing and everything. Doak had turned away\nbefore he remembered. Then he turned back. \"Oh, yes, and Senator\nArnold? Where does he live?\"\n\n\"Big house, over the hill,\" the agent said. \"Only big house around\nhere--you can't miss it. Got a high stone fence all around it and two\nvicious dogs. God knows what he's scared of.\" This was a different man\nfrom the one who had remarked on the beauty of the evening.\n\n\"Thanks,\" Doak said. \"Thanks again.\"\n\nPolitical resentment--or some local feud? Doak went along the platform\nto the single step that led to the street.\n\nThere was a breeze from the east, cooling the warm air. He turned in\nat the drug store and could scarcely believe his eyes.\n\nBent wire chairs and marble-topped tables with bent wire legs. No\ntoasters, video sets, geiger counters, ray guns or portable garbage\ndetergents.\n\nBut dim and cool and with a high marble fountain. \"A lime-ade,\" Doak\nsaid, \"with a sprig of mint.\"\n\nThe man behind the fountain wore a blue jacket over his white shirt.\nHe had a thin face and a high-domed head and intelligent blue eyes.\n\nDoak sat on one of the high wire stools and lighted a cigarette. \"Hot\nday, was it?\"\n\n\"Hot enough. But we get the night breeze. Stranger in town?\"\n\n\"From Milwaukee,\" Doak said. \"Out to visit Senator Arnold.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" The man set the drink in front of Doak.\n\n\"Trying to talk him into leaving some money to the University,\" Doak\nadded. \"Guess he's a pretty hard man to get money from.\"\n\n\"I hear he is. I wouldn't know about it. He--doesn't shop in town.\"\n\nThe drink was freshly flavorful, cool as springwater. Doak rubbed the\nbeaded moisture with a thumb. \"Pretty town,\" he said. \"Pretty country\naround here.\"\n\n\"Peaceful,\" the man agreed. \"I've never been anywhere else, so I\ncouldn't judge it right, I guess--but then I've never had the urge to\ngo anywhere else, so it must be all right.\"\n\n\"These days,\" Doak said, \"a man doesn't need to go anywhere else. They\nbring the world right to you.\"\n\n\"I guess. Hear they're having a hard time getting Venus populated. I\nguess people aren't as rootless as the planners figured.\"\n\nBy \"the planners\" the man undoubtedly meant THAT WASHINGTON CROWD.\nDoak finished his drink and went up the street to the grey house with\nthe blue shutters on the curve.\n\nThere was a woman sitting on the front porch, a short and heavy woman\nwith dark hair and brown eyes. She smiled at him and said, \"Good\nevening,\" without rising.\n\n\"Mrs. Klein?\" Doak asked and she nodded. He said, \"The station agent\ntold me you rented rooms and served meals. My name is Doak Parker.\"\n\n\"A pleasure, Mr. Parker. If you'll go through the living room and take\nthat door at the east end of it, you'll come to a hall. The room at\nthe back of the hall's the one, if you'd like to look at it.\" She\ndidn't move from her chair.\n\nHe went into the dim living room and through the door and down the\nhall. A mahogany bed with a patchwork quilt for a spread, a mahogany\ndresser and a huge wicker chair, upholstered in a bright chintz. It\nwas a chintzy house.\n\n\n\nHe looked out the back window and saw a neat lawn, bordered with\nflowering shrubs. He put his grip on the floor and came back to the\nliving room.\n\nThere were windows along the front of this room and they were open. He\ncould see Mrs. Klein in her chair and a girl standing next to her.\n\nThere was no reason for him to pause but he did. He'd heard Mrs.\nKlein say, \"Another meeting tonight, Martha?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" The girl's voice was defensive.\n\n\"Why--why, Martha? Don't you realize the danger of--oh, Martha!\"\n\n\"Mother, please. There's no danger. We're careful.\"\n\nDoak coughed and walked out again onto the porch. The girl standing\nthere was as dark as her mother but slim and long-legged and vividly\nbeautiful.\n\nMrs. Klein said, \"My daughter Martha, Mr. Parker. You liked the room?\"\n\n\"It's fine,\" he said and to Martha, \"How do you do?\"\n\n\"How do you do, Mr. Parker? You've had supper?\"\n\nHe nodded and lied, \"In Milwaukee. I'm up here to try and get some\nmoney out of Senator Arnold. I wonder if this might be a good time to\nsee him.\"\n\nMrs. Klein said, \"I doubt if anytime is a good time to see him. You're\na salesman, Mr. Parker?\"\n\n\"No, no. It's philanthropy I'm concerned with. Mr. Arnold's old enough\nto start thinking about his benefactors.\"\n\n\"He'll probably leave it all to the dogs,\" Mrs. Klein said. \"And you\nbe careful of them, Mr. Parker.\"\n\n\"That I will,\" Doak said. \"I think I'll walk up there now. Not much of\na walk, I understand. Just over the hill, isn't it?\"\n\nIt was the girl who answered. \"That's right. I'm going that way\nmyself. I'll be glad to show you the house.\"\n\nMrs. Klein said, \"You're leaving so soon, Martha?\"\n\n\"Right now. I'll be home early. Don't fret about me, Mother.\"\n\nThey went down the walk together, Doak and Martha, and he had\nforgotten June and the Department and all the girls who would be out,\nlooking, tonight in Washington.\n\nShe walked easily at his side, poised and quiet.\n\nHe said, \"Do you work in town?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"For an attorney. I was going to law school myself until\nDad died.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" he said.\n\nHe wondered at his lack of words, and the strange sense of--almost of\ninferiority glimmering in him. She hadn't said anything or done\nanything to place him at a disadvantage but he knew this was no lass\nfor the casual pitch.\n\nThey came to the crest of the hill and saw the dying sun low in the\nwest. The quiet was almost absolute. About a hundred yards on the\nother side of the ridge was a road leading off to the south. On the\nright side of this road was the big house with the high stone fence.\n\nDoak said quietly, \"There's a few sentences that have been bothering\nme all day. I wonder if you'd recognize them. They're, 'Studious, let\nme sit and hold high converse with the mighty dead.' One of the Scotch\npoets probably.\"\n\n\"Thomson,\" she said, \"from his _Seasons_.\" She looked straight ahead.\n\n\"I'm not sure I understand exactly what he meant,\" Doak said.\n\n\"He meant--reading.\" She turned to look at him. \"This is Senator\nArnold's house, Mr. Parker. You might ask him what Thomson meant.\"\n\nHer smile was brief and cool. She walked on.\n\nBehind the fence, the dogs started to bark. In the huge gatepost was a\npair of paneled doors about three feet high, the lower edges about\nfour feet from the ground. A sign read, _Visitors, kindly use this\nphone_.\n\nDoak opened the double doors and lifted the phone. As he did so a\nscanning light went on in the weatherproof niche. Someone said, \"Yes?\"\n\n\"Officer Parker of Security. I believe I'm expected.\"\n\n\"One moment, sir.\"\n\nSilence, except for the sniffing dogs. And then the sniffing stopped\nand he heard the pad of their feet, as they raced for the house and\nthe voice in the phone said, \"The gates will be open soon, Mr.\nParker.\"\n\nThey opened in less than a minute. At the far end of the gravel drive\na turreted monstrosity loomed, a weathered wooden structure that had\nundoubtedly once been white.\n\nIt was now as ashen as the face of Senator Arnold, bleak against the\nskyline, set back on a dandelion-covered lawn. Behind the wrought-iron\nfence, to the right of the house, the dogs watched him approach.\n\nThey were German Boxers, formidable creatures and great slobberers.\nThey drooled as he walked up to the low porch but uttered not a sound.\n\nThe man who opened the door was fat and needed a shave. He wore a\nshiny, duraserge suit. \"Follow me, please, Mr. Parker.\"\n\n\nIII\n\nDoak followed him through a high musty living room into a small room\noff this. There was a small hynrane heater in here, and the room was\nstifling.\n\nSenator Arnold sat in a wheel chair, his feet elevated. He wore a\ngreasy muffler around his thin neck and a heavy reefer buttoned all\nthe way up.\n\nThe fat man left, closing the door behind him. Arnold looked Doak over\nfrom head to feet and came back up. \"It's about time. Your\ncredentials?\"\n\nDoak handed over his wallet. There was, he saw, no chair in the room.\nEvidently, he was supposed to stand through the interview.\n\nThe old man handed the wallet back. \"The place is right up that road\nto the south. First house, only house in sight.\"\n\nDoak put his wallet in his pocket. \"Just what kind of business do you\nthink is going on up there, Senator?\"\n\nThe old man seemed to spit the word. \"Readers.\"\n\nDoak exhaled, saying nothing.\n\n\"And maybe more,\" the old man said and his eyes were unholy. \"Maybe--I\nwouldn't be surprised if they're--they're _printing_ something up\nthere.\" He coughed.\n\nSweat poured off Doak as the glowing hynrane heater made an oven of\nthe windowless room.\n\nThe old man closed his eyes. \"In my home town, the vermin, in my own\ntown! They always laughed at me here but, by God, that was before the\nstate saw fit to send me to the Senate. The last laugh's been mine.\nBut now--right under my nose, you might say!\" He opened his eyes and\nglared at Doak.\n\n\"Subversive reading, you think?\" Doak asked.\n\nThe old man stared at him. \"Is there another kind? I shouldn't have to\nask that of a Security Officer. What kind of men is the Department\nhiring these days?\"\n\nDoak thought of something to say and decided not to. He said, \"I\nwondered about how dangerous they were. If I'd need additional men.\"\n\n\"For readers? Young man, there must be some red blood in your veins.\nBy God, if I was two years younger, I'd go along just for the joy of\nsmashing them.\" He was trembling, leaning forward in his chair. \"Go\nnow, go and trap the filthy scum.\"\n\nDoak went. He left the hot and odorous room and went out through the\ncool and odorous room to the front hall and out the front door. There\nhis nausea quieted a little under the sun-warmed air from the east.\n\nBehind the wrought-iron fence the dogs slobbered and watched, only\ntheir heads moving. As he went down the gravel drive to the heavy gate\nhe was conscious of their stares and a coldness moved through him. The\ngates opened when he was twenty feet away.\n\nIt was growing dark and the breeze seemed stronger. On the road to the\nsouth, the Range Road, the house identified as the old Fisher place\nrevealed one light in a first-floor room. There were two cars in the\nyard.\n\nDoak turned back toward town but paused over the crest of the hill and\nsought cover. There was a small grove of hickory and oak to his left.\nHe walked into their shelter until he was out of any passerby's range\nof vision.\n\nReaders wouldn't be any trouble. But printers? If the old mummy was\nright in his guess Doak could have more trouble than one man could\nhandle.\n\nHe put his back up against the rough bark of an oak tree and sat\nhugging his knees, waiting for the darkness. _Studious let me sit...._\nOh, yes.\n\nPrinters--and what would they print? Had any poets been born since the\nArnold Law, any writers? Was there some urge to write in a readerless\nworld? In the Russian homes, he'd heard, under the machine gods, the\nold religion persisted, from parent to child, by word of mouth.\n\nBut writers without an audience? An art that persisted without\nfollowers?\n\nThat girl, that lovely poised girl-creature had been quick to identify\nThomson and he wasn't one of the giants. If there were others with\nequally fertile memories, and they got together, it would be like a\nsmall--what was the word?--a small library.\n\nThey could write or print or type the remembered offerings of all the\nreaders and have a book. Or at least a pamphlet.\n\nIt grew darker and he thought of June and wondered, if her memory were\nsearched, just what would be dredged up. He'd bet it would be one\nword--_no_.\n\nAnd now it was dark enough and he rose and made his way back over the\nhill, toward the Fisher place, following the field instead of the\nroad, keeping to the tall grass, conscious of the crickets and the\nnight breeze and the light in the first floor room of the Fisher\nplace.\n\nThere was another car in the drive now and he could see a few people\nin the room. He could see Martha and next to her an aged man with a\nbeard like snow. He went past the window and around in back of the\nhouse.\n\nThere was an unlatched rear door and he entered a dark rear hall and\nput on his infra-scope. Now he could see the three steps leading to an\nopen door and he went up the steps to the kitchen. There he could hear\ntheir voices.\n\nMartha was talking. \"As Dan has told you there's nothing to fear from\nan injection of lucidate. It's a perfectly harmless drug with no\nserious aftereffects that promotes total recall. Total recall is what\nwe need unless we get a much larger group of donors than we have\npresently.\n\n\"Readers are no problem. We've had more requests for our magazine than\nwe can fill. Our biggest problem, more important than getting memory\ndonors, is to find someone who can contribute significant original\nwork. For that kind of man we're still searching. Or woman.\"\n\nDoak moved quietly, very slowly, past the kitchen sink and along the\nshort hall that led to the dining room. There was a swinging door\nhere, closed, but the upper half was glass and he could see through\nthe dining room into the lighted living room. He took off the\ninfra-scope glasses.\n\nNine people were in the room, seven men and two women. The men ranged\nin age from about twenty-three to the old gent with the beard, who\nseemed ageless. The other woman was a gray-haired lady of about fifty\nwith fine features and a rich contralto voice.\n\nShe was saying, \"I'd like to be the first to go under the lucidate.\"\n\nNext to a maple fireman's chair a man who looked about forty nodded\nand the woman came forward to sit in the chair. He had a hypodermic in\nhis hand and she extended her arm.\n\nOn the far side of the room Martha was wheeling up a small recording\nmachine.\n\nNow the woman's eyes were closed and the others sat back, watching\nher. The contralto voice was clear and resonant.\n\n  \"'... 'tis but thy name that is my enemy\n  Thou art thyself though, not a Montague.\n  What's Montague? It is nor hand nor foot,\n  Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part\n  Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!\n  What's in a name? that which we call a rose,\n  By any other name would smell as sweet...'\"\n\nThe rich voice, the flowing rhythm, the silence--was it Burns she\nquoted? No--he knew all of Burns--but this was some giant of the past;\nthis was almost up to vintage Burns.\n\nHe left his vantage point and went quietly back to the kitchen,\ndonning his infra-scope once more. In some of these old houses there\nwas a back steps, leading to the second floor.\n\nAnother door leading off the kitchen, another hall--and the steps.\n\nThey would undoubtedly creak. But they might not creak loudly enough\nto disturb that circle of mesmerized individuals listening to the\ncontralto magic.\n\nThere was only one small creak, halfway up.\n\nThree rooms led off a narrow hall. One held a cot and a dresser and a\nstraight-backed chair. The second room he entered had a strange smell.\nA smell he didn't recognize. Ink? Was that a mimeograph machine?\nSomething stirred in his memory, some picture he had seen of a\nduplicating machine somewhere. This other dingus was undoubtedly a\ntypewriter--and this small gadget on the desk a stapler.\n\nAnd here, on a small pine table, was a sheaf of four mimeographed\npages, stapled together.\n\nThe heading read, _The Heritage Herald_.\n\nThat was the name of their magazine. Printers, under the technical\ninterpretation of the law. A typewriter and a duplicating machine and\nstencils and ink--and words.\n\nShakespeare, whoever he was, and Robert W. Service and Milton and an\noriginal by S. Crittington Jones.\n\nThe original was a short-short tale about a wrestler and a cowboy and\na video comedian, a space-farce. There was a piece headed _Editorial_\nby Martha Klein. It had a sub-heading--_For Those Who Are Willing To\nFight_.\n\nIt was a stirring and vigorous call to arms against the Arnold Law. It\nwas as subversive as anything Doak had seen in his Department career.\n\nHe folded the magazine, and put it into an upper jacket pocket. He\nwent to the third room and saw the paper stacked there and the bottles\nof ink and new stencils.\n\nHe went back to the stairs, and quietly down them. From the living\nroom, he heard--\n\n  \"'... From scenes like these old Scotia's grandeur springs,\n  That makes her loved at home, revered abroad;\n  Princes and lords are but the breath of kings,\n  An honest man's the noblest work of God!'\"\n\nThis was more like it, except for that last line the bard had\nborrowed. This was the true giant, and who was quoting him? It was\nnot the contralto voice. Who?\n\nHe moved out to the kitchen and back to his vantage point. He took off\nthe infra-scope and looked into the living room. It was the old gent,\nwith the beard. And who else could it be? For wasn't he the cream of\nthe lot, the most obvious scholar, the most evident gentleman?\nScholarship and breeding seemed to flow from every hair in his beard.\n\n  \"O Scotia! my dear, my native soil!\n  From whom my warmest wish to heaven is sent,\n  Long may thy hardy sons of rustic toil\n  Be blessed with health and peace and sweet content!\n  And, O, may heaven their--\"\n\nDoak felt a stirring in him and tears moved down his cheeks and he\nturned, quickly and silently, and went out the back door. He was no\nchild at his mother's knee, he was no mewling kitten--he was a\nSecurity Officer and this was subversion.\n\nOutside the stars were bright in a black sky. He stood in the back\nyard, breathing heavily, ashamed at the sudden surge of feeling that\nhad moved through him. Some streak of adolescence, he thought, stirred\nby the words he had remembered from his mother's lips.\n\nHe walked slowly back toward town. He could call in local help and\nround up the gang back there in the house. He could wash this up\ntonight and be back in Washington tomorrow morning. With June.\n\nThe prospect of being with June had lost its flavor somehow. And if\nthis was a widely published magazine, he had a larger duty than merely\napprehending the gang. All of the magazine's readers were breaking the\nlaw and a real operative comes in with a complete, clean case.\n\nMrs. Klein still sat on her front porch. \"Any luck?\" she asked, as he\ncame up to sit on the glider near her chair.\n\n\"Some. I'll see him again tomorrow.\"\n\nHer voice was dry. \"One of our most prominent citizens, the Senator.\nThe other's Glen Ryder. I guess you know who he is.\"\n\nHe stiffened, trying to see her face in the dark. \"Ryder? Oh, yes, in\nthe Security Department.\"\n\n\"That's right. Glen isn't anything to be ashamed of really. But that\nSenator Arnold--my, the stories my mother told me about him!\"\n\n\"I've heard,\" Doak said, \"he was pretty wild as a young man.\"\n\n\"Wild?\" Mrs. Klein sniffed. \"Degraded would be a better word. If his\nfather didn't have all the money in the county he'd have gone to jail\nmore than once, that man. And then the people of this state sending\nhim to the Senate.\"\n\nDoak said nothing, staring out at the quiet night.\n\n\"Would you like a little snack?\" Mrs. Klein asked. \"I've some baked\nham and rolls out in the kitchen.\"\n\n\"No thanks,\" Doak said. \"I'm not very hungry. Was Glen Ryder a friend\nof Senator Arnold's?\"\n\n\"Not until Glen went to work for the government. I don't think the\nSenator had any friends except those who could profit by it.\"\n\n\"This Ryder was something of an--opportunist?\"\n\n\"If that means what it sounds like, I guess that would describe Glen.\nHe wasn't one to overlook any opportunity to better himself and he cut\nit pretty thin at times.\"\n\nDoak looked over but could not see her face in the darkness. He said\nslowly, \"I guess we all have to look out for ourselves and the devil\ntake the hindmost.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" she said placidly. \"Though it would depend on what you\nwanted out of life. Here in Dubbinville I think we're a little more\nneighborly than that.\"\n\n\"It's a nice town,\" Doak said. \"A real nice town.\"\n\nIn front a car was stopping on the other side of the road. Someone got\nout from the door on the far side and the car moved on.\n\n\"That would be Martha, I guess,\" Mrs. Klein said. \"She'll want some of\nthat ham, I know. You may as well have a cup of coffee with us\nanyway.\"\n\n\nIV\n\nDoak had some coffee and some rolls and ham. And some talk with both\nof them in the bright comfortable kitchen. They talked about the\nridiculous price of food in the city and how cool the house was after\nthe heat of the day and what was it like on Venus?\n\nNeither of the women had ever been to Venus. Doak told them about the\nlakes, the virgin timber, the glareless warmth that came from the\ngenerative earth.\n\nAnd about the lack of communication facilities.\n\n\"There isn't enough commerce to make any video installations\nworthwhile,\" he explained, \"and the only information transmission is\nby amateur radio operators. But nobody seems to miss it. It's got\nenough vacation facilities without video.\"\n\nMartha looked at him evenly. \"The--Arnold Law applies there, too,\ndoesn't it?\"\n\nDoak met her gaze. \"Of course.\" And then, \"Why do you ask?\"\n\nShe smiled. \"I was thinking it would be a good place to curl up with a\nbook.\" Her chin lifted. \"Or establish a newspaper.\"\n\nHe didn't answer. He took another roll and buttered it.\n\nMrs. Klein said, \"Martha's too young to know what a newspaper is--or a\nbook. And so are you, Mr. Parker. I say we're not missing much.\"\n\nHe grinned at her. \"Bad, were they?\"\n\n\"There was a paper in Chicago so bad you'd think I was lying if I\ntried to describe it to you. And all the books seemed to be concerned\nwith four-letter words.\"\n\nHe carefully put a piece of ham between the broken halves of the roll.\n\"Even Bobbie Burns? From what my mother told me he was quite a lad.\"\n\n\"He was dead before your mother was born,\" Mrs. Klein said. \"All the\ngood ones were, all the ones who tried to entertain instead of shock\nor corrupt.\"\n\nMartha said lightly, \"Mama's an admirer of Senator Arnold, the way it\nsounds.\"\n\n\"I'll thank you not to mention his name while I'm eating,\" Mrs. Klein\nsaid acidly. \"And I'm not forgetting why _he_ hated the printed word.\nBut that's looking a gift horse in the mouth.\"\n\nDoak sipped his coffee. His voice was casual. \"Why did he hate the\nprinted word?\"\n\n\"He couldn't read anything but the simplest words. The tutors his\nfather hired and fired to get some learning into that man! He was just\nhopeless, that's all.\"\n\nDoak smiled. \"Well, he seems to have done all right without it. I'd\nlike to have his money.\"\n\n\"And his brain?\" Martha asked.\n\n\"Just his money,\" Doak said. \"And maybe I'll get some of it before I\ngive up on him.\"\n\nHe happened to glance at Martha after he finished saying that. Her\nface was coldly skeptical and he had an uncomfortable feeling that his\nlie hadn't registered with her at all.\n\nIn his room, as he undressed, as he hung his clothes in the small\ncloset, he felt the folded thickness of the dupligraphed magazine in\nhis jacket pocket.\n\nWhat more did he need? Tomorrow he'd take the first train back to\nMilwaukee and the first plane from Milwaukee. Here was evidence and he\nrealized now it wasn't something he would be wise to tackle alone. A\nfew weeks' work by a half dozen operatives and the entire\npublisher-reader organization would be spotted and ready for one\nunified move.\n\nLocal authorities were subject to local loyalties and one leak could\nscare off the whole organization. He could be back in Washington\nbefore noon, which would give him a full day and a half of free time,\nof June time. To say nothing of the nights.\n\nWhy should he hang around this whistle stop for a wasted week-end,\nholding kitchen conversations with the unmighty living?\n\nBut that Martha, that lovely, that proud and knowing gal.... The\ncrickets helped him to Dreamland.\n\nThe morning sun was bright on the quilted bedspread when he opened his\neyes. There was no sound of meal preparation in the house, no\ndialogue. Was it early?\n\nIt was ten o'clock. Not since he was a child had he enjoyed as long\nand satisfying a sleep as this.\n\nWhen he came out of the bathroom Mrs. Klein was in the hall. \"About\nfive minutes?\" she asked.\n\n\"Make it two,\" he told her and winked. \"I'm starving.\"\n\nMartha had already gone to work. Doak sat down alone to popovers and\noatmeal, eggs and Canadian bacon. And real coffee. He had an almost\nanimal sense of well being. His decision to go back to Washington,\nwhich had seemed so final last night, was fading under the Dubbinville\nspell.\n\nAfter breakfast he walked down to the station and inquired about\nMilwaukee-bound trains.\n\n\"There's one due at noon,\" the agent told him. \"Stops on signal. You\nwant me to stop it?\"\n\n\"That's kind of early,\" Doak said. \"When's the next?\"\n\n\"At six tonight. A local. Doesn't need a signal.\"\n\nThat would be soon enough. Doak left and walked slowly up the main\nstreet of Dubbinville. He was walking past the bank when the beard\ncaught his gaze.\n\n\n\nIt was the Burns quoter of last night. He was sitting behind the\nbiggest desk in the open portion of the bank, and there was a sign on\nhis desk.\n\nThe sign read, _Malcolm S. Sutherland--President_.\n\nLordy, Lordy, Lordy--the president of the bank! That showed the strata\nthis subversion was reaching. Didn't the man realize what a risk he\nwas taking?\n\nIn the drugstore he saw another of the faces he had seen last night.\nIt was the man who had administered the hypodermic. He was talking to\nthe druggist. Doak turned and went in.\n\n\"All right, Doctor,\" the druggist said. \"I'll have it about one\no'clock. Will that be all right?\"\n\n\"Fine,\" the doctor said. He went out.\n\nDoak bought a package of cigarettes. \"Was that Doctor Ryan by any\nchance?\"\n\n\"No. Doctor Helgeson. I don't recall a Doctor Ryan. Doctor Helgeson's\nthe only medical doctor in town.\"\n\n\"This Ryan's a Ph.D.\" Doak said. \"Senator Arnold told me about him.\nBeautiful day, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Beautiful,\" the druggist agreed.\n\nWalking back to the house Doak wondered if this couldn't be handled\nwithout punitive measures being taken. The only doctor in town and the\npresident of the bank--and they were probably only a small part of the\npicture. It could disrupt this town if Senator Arnold had his way.\n\nAnd what was their crime? Reading. A law as stupid as the ancient\nprohibition law had been, pushed through a bewildered Congress under\nmuch the same conditions. Supported by a strange blend of the divine\nand ridiculous, the naive and the clever, the gullible and the\nknowing.\n\nWell, was it his business? _He_ didn't make the laws--he only helped\nto enforce them. It was a logical answer and why didn't it satisfy\nhim?\n\nHe had a job, a good job at the public trough in a woman-heavy city, a\nsecurity that was as solid as his country. Why should he fret over a\ngang of law-breakers? Unless it was that cow-town cutie, that Martha.\nUnless he was so dame-happy he'd sell out the Department. That corrupt\nhe certainly wasn't--at least, not yet.\n\nAnd they weren't readers anyway--they were publishers. He had almost\nforgotten that. Inciters to violence, instigators of strife, polluters\nof the mind ... Good Lord, he was beginning to sound like\ncrack-brained ex-Senator Arnold!\n\n\nV\n\nMrs. Klein was shaking out a rug on the front porch. She smiled at\nhim. \"Not much to do here, for a city man, is there?\"\n\n\"I'm not bored,\" he said, \"for some reason. You have a beautiful\ndaughter, Mrs. Klein.\"\n\n\"I'd feel happier about her looks if she'd marry somebody,\" Mrs. Klein\nsaid dryly. \"Seems to me they're wasted this way.\"\n\nDoak sat on the glider. What was it someone had said about marriage?\nOh, yes--that it combined the ultimate in temptation with the ultimate\nin opportunity.\n\nHe said, \"I'm surprised she isn't married. The men around here must be\nblind or mute.\"\n\n\"Oh, she's had enough offers,\" Mrs. Klein answered. She laid the rug\nover the porch railing. \"But she's a fussy stubborn girl.\" She sat in\nher chair. \"You a married man, Mr. Parker?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"Never had the time nor the money--and besides they\nall said no to me.\"\n\n\"I'll bet. With that hair of yours and that fine head, with those\neyes, I'll _bet_ they said no.\"\n\n\"Why, thank you!\" Doak said. \"You have a number of good points,\nyourself, Mrs. Klein.\"\n\n\"My popovers and my coffee, maybe,\" she agreed. \"And my figure wasn't\nbad, a decade or two back. But I never had Martha's looks. That's from\nher dad's side of the family.\"\n\n\"Handsome, were they?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. High falutin' people, scholars and beauties who owned half\nthe land in the county, at one time. Old Wisconsin Germans. I'm Irish\nmyself.\"\n\nBright scintillating dialogue, stirring the quick response. But he\nfelt as relaxed as though he had hay in his hair. He looked out at the\ndeserted road, at the fields beyond, at the clouds on the clear\nhorizon. Rural summer--a quiet Saturday morning in the agricultural\nMidwest only nineteen minutes from Chicago.\n\nPeople spoke of other worlds and here was one, nineteen minutes from\nChicago. And last night, under the lucidate, the town banker had gone\nto another world, three hundred years away, had gone back to the magic\nof Burns.\n\nA great lad for the ladies, Bobbie Burns, and a great love for the\npeople. A poet with revolutionary leanings, all heart, a bleeder and a\nbeliever. Studious, Doak sat, on the front porch in another world.\n\nWere the people so stupid they couldn't be trusted with words? They\ncould be misled with words and confused and stirred to unrighteous\nanger. And informed with words and guided and ennobled and solaced and\nstirred to high destiny.\n\nHow had wrestling ever taken the place of words?\n\nSomeone said, \"Dreaming, city-man?\"\n\nHe looked up quickly to see Martha standing there. Mrs. Klein had\nevidently gone into the house without his being aware of it.\n\n\"Dreaming,\" Doak admitted. \"Holding high converse with the mighty\ndead.\" He smiled at her. \"Through for the week?\"\n\n\"Through.\" She took the chair her mother usually occupied. \"Five and a\nhalf days of whereas and wherefore earns me a day and a half for\nmyself. At the risk of seeming forward would you like to go swimming\nwith me this afternoon?\"\n\n\"I can't think of a better way to spend it,\" Doak answered. \"How about\ntransportation?\"\n\n\"It's only a little over a mile. We can walk.\" She paused. \"Or did you\nplan to see Senator Arnold?\"\n\n\"I'd rather go swimming,\" Doak said.\n\nWhich they did. In the waters of Lake Memahbin, in the small cove that\nharbored the entire recreational facilities of Dubbinville. Doak\nrented some trunks there and they swam out to the raft.\n\nThere weren't too many adults in the water this afternoon but the kids\nwere everywhere. Noisy splashing running kids--but very few of them\nventured out to the big raft.\n\nThere was a park running the length of the beach and a variety of\ngames--table tennis, horse-shoes, shuffleboard. There was a small\ngroup around the table in the grove who seemed to be just sitting.\n\nDoak saw the beard and the lady who had quoted the unknown poet, last\nnight. He and Martha lay on their stomachs on the raft, looking back\ntoward the shore.\n\nDoak said easily, \"That gang in the glade doesn't seem to be having\nmuch fun.\"\n\n\"Solid citizens,\" Martha said. \"That lady is the principal of the high\nschool and the man with the beard is president of the bank. You\ncouldn't expect them to run and shout, could you?\"\n\nDoak said nothing.\n\nShe turned over on her side to look at him. \"Any luck with the\nSenator?\"\n\n\"Not much so far. I'll get him, before Monday, though.\"\n\nShe stood up and he felt a stirring in him at the sight of her taut\nfully-feminine figure. She poised on the edge of the raft and then her\ntanned body went slanting toward the water.\n\nShe came up directly beneath him and splashed a handful of water into\nhis face. \"Sun worshipper,\" she mocked. \"The trip out do you in?\"\n\nHe made a face at her and she went under.\n\nHe looked over at the group in the glade. High school principal,\ncustodian of young minds--and a reader. Worse than that, a partner in\na publishing venture.\n\nCorruption? What kind of mind would it take to believe there was\ncorruption in that group? A Senator Arnold kind of mind. Rebellion,\nyes. Oh, very definitely rebellion--under the Arnold Law.\n\nBut how could--\n\nSomebody had his feet and he was being pulled head over toes into the\nwaiting water. He came up spluttering to see Martha laughing at him\nfrom the edge of the raft.\n\nHe started to climb up and she dove off the further side. He went\nafter her. Much laughter and great sport. An excuse to grab her, here\nand there, to feel the firm, warm smoothness of her, to quicken to the\nchallenge of her body.\n\nIn the glade the watchers sat, missing nothing.\n\nDoak said, \"I'm not sure the solid citizens approve of your maidenly\nfrolicking. They seem to be frowning our way.\"\n\n\"Studious types,\" Martha said, \"but not necessarily disapproving.\"\n\nDoak was silent, staring at the water.\n\n\"Bored?\" Her voice was light.\n\nHe looked up. \"I've never been less bored. Martha, I....\" He shook his\nhead in vexation.\n\n\"It's a little early for a pitch,\" she said, \"though you do give it a\nwarming amateur earnestness. Or wasn't it going to be a pitch?\"\n\nHe looked at her steadily. \"What else?\"\n\n\"A warning maybe?\" a break in the light tone.\n\n\"What kind of warning?\"\n\nIt was her turn to look at the water--and to color? It seemed so,\nfaintly, under the tan. She said, \"To warn me that you're married or\npoor or uninterested.\" She looked up, smiling. \"I'm such a simple\ncountry girl.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"Sure.\" He looked over at the watchers. \"Are they\nfriends of yours?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Her eyes wide and searching, her face and body taut. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Wondered. Am I being played for a patsy?\"\n\nSilence while she studied him. Silence while the raft gently rocked,\nand the world. \"Patsy?\" she asked.\n\n\"Forget it. You have a great charm and an unholy animal attraction for\nme, Martha Klein, and maybe we'd better get back to shore and have a\nquiet cigarette.\"\n\nThey had a cigarette and a hot dog with a skin on it, the first Doak\nhad ever seen. They had grape pop and a few laughs. Fun in the sun at\nDubbinville, U.S.A. Wouldn't the gang at home get a belt out of this?\nAnd where was June's bright metallic laughter being heard this golden\nafternoon?\n\nThey walked back to town quietly, exertion-spent, sun-calmed. They\ncame up onto the porch, and Mrs. Klein looked from Martha's face to\nDoak's and frowned--and sighed.\n\n\"Fun?\" she asked.\n\n\"Wonderful,\" Doak said. \"And Martha surprised me by being able to\nswim. None of my other girls can swim a lick.\"\n\n\"Martha's no girl,\" Mrs. Klein said. \"She's twenty-seven.\"\n\nMartha laughed. \"Why, mother, you'll never get rid of me that way.\"\n\nMrs. Klein said, \"I almost forgot. Mr. Arnold called. Wants to see\nyou, Mr. Parker, tonight.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe he is sold. Wonder how he knew I was here.\"\n\n\"There isn't much he doesn't know about what's going on in town,\"\nMrs. Klein said. \"I'd wager there isn't _anything_.\" She looked at\nMartha as she said that last.\n\nMartha's face was blank.\n\n\"Maybe I can put it off until tomorrow,\" Doak said. \"It's been a\npretty good day up to now.\"\n\nHe called the Senator from the drug store in town. He told him,\n\"Nothing definite, yet, Senator.\"\n\n\"Don't give me that,\" Arnold said raspingly. \"Get up here right away,\nParker.\"\n\nDoak stopped at the house on the way back. He told Mrs. Klein, \"I\nmight be a little late for supper. I think I'll run up and see the\nSenator now and get it over with.\"\n\n\"We'll hold it,\" she said. She looked around to see if Martha was\nwithin hearing. Then, \"You're not trifling with my girl, Mr. Parker?\"\n\n\"Not for a second,\" Doak assured her. \"Though I have an uncomfortable\nfeeling she's trifling with me, but good.\"\n\nMrs. Klein shook her dark head. \"Not with that sick-calf look on her\nface. The girl's smitten. You watch your step, Mr. Parker.\"\n\n\"I promise,\" he said. \"I'll be back as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe hot room, the face like ashes, the cracked voice. No chair again\nfor Doak. Arnold said, \"You went up there last night, I know. Well?\"\n\n\"I'll make a full report to my superior,\" Doak said. \"I'm not\npermitted to discuss Department business with _anybody_, Senator.\"\n\nArnold's thin lips were open, his bony jaw slack. \"Well, I'll be\ndamned. Do you know who you're talking to, young man?\"\n\n\"An _ex_-Senator,\" Doak answered.\n\n\"That's right--and the man who put your superior where he is. He'd\nstill be peddling papers if I hadn't got him into the Department.\"\n\nDoak said nothing.\n\n\"I could get your job in a minute,\" Arnold went on. \"I'm a hell of a\nlong ways from dead, Parker. You'd better wake up.\"\n\nDoak had no words.\n\n\"Well, damn it, man, are you dumb? What have you got to say?\"\n\n\"I've said it, sir,\" Doak said quietly.\n\nFor long and silent seconds, Arnold glared at him. And then he said,\n\"All right. I'll get my report from Ryder--and your job. Now get out.\"\n\nFine, _great_! Hero Doak Parker, of Security. Lion bearder,\nhair-splitter, cutter-of-his-own-throat, lover of a country lass. And\nman without a future, it looked like now.\n\n\n\nThe dogs slobbered and watched, the gravel grated under his feet. The\ngreat gates swung open and Doak took a deep breath of the warm clean\nair. Why did he feel so free?\n\nMartha was sitting on the front porch. She looked up and smiled as he\ncame near and he stooped to kiss her.\n\n\"Hey!\" she said. \"Watch it, city man.\" But she hadn't taken her lips\naway for a few seconds.\n\nFrom his jacket pocket he took the _Heritage Herald_ and tossed it in\nher lap. She looked down at it for seconds, then up to read his face.\nHe said nothing.\n\n\"Last night,\" she said, \"you got it. I missed it when I went upstairs,\nlast night, but I thought someone else might have taken it.\"\n\n\"_I_ took it--last night.\"\n\nHer eyes searched his wonderingly but there was no evident tension in\nher. Doak sat on the glider.\n\nShe said, \"I was too forward to be believed this afternoon, perhaps?\nDid you listen last night?\"\n\n\"I listened. I'm from Security, Martha--or was. I'm resigning.\"\n\n\"Oh? To fight the good fight?\"\n\nHe nodded. \"But legally--or what is known as legally. Through the\npressure-group pattern. I know my way around Washington, Martha. I\nthink, in time and with the right people behind me, I think I\ncould--oh, hell!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"Oh, hell! When you were swimming this afternoon we\ncould have got this, Doak. I told them to wait. I told them I thought\nyou had the makings of an honest man.\"\n\n\"Why?\" He stared at her.\n\n\"I don't know why. Maybe your curly hair. I'm admitting nothing along\nthat line, not yet, Doak. I want to see what kind of fighter you are,\nhow much man you are.\"\n\n\"I wish I knew,\" he said quietly. \"One thing I'm sure of, I'm going to\nenjoy the battle.\"\n\n\"You're going to enjoy both battles,\" Martha said. \"And probably win\nboth. But oh, the bastards we're going to have to fight.\"\n\nHe smiled and looked out at the shadowed lawn. This would be a place\nfor the historians, the _writing_ historians, Dubbinville, U.S.A. And\nwhy should a man be happy, looking forward to so damned much trouble?\n\n\n    _Mr. Gault has just presented us with a wholly plausible if\n    highly terrifying view of a reasonably near future. Such\n    things could, conceivably, come to pass. And prophecy, from\n    the time of Jules Verne to the present, has long been one of\n    the several spinal columns of science fiction. Yet is it\n    possible for anyone to predict an unvisited future? We are\n    inclined to think not. Gadgetry to come, as repeatedly\n    demonstrated by Verne, is easy. But no one yet has been able\n    to tell what human beings are going to do from day to day,\n    much less years and years ahead of time._",
