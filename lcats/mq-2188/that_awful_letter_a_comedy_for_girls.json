Margaret\noverdressed, is sitting reading a magazine. She looks up impatiently\nand throws it down in disgust._)\n\nMARGARET\u2014(_crossly._) There\u2019s no use in my trying to read or do\nanything else when I\u2019m so provoked. I don\u2019t see why dad can\u2019t (_the\nbell rings_) Oh, drat that bell! I don\u2019t want to see any person. I wish\npeople would stay at home. (_Goes and looks out._) Oh! it\u2019s Helen! I\nwonder what she wants now. She is always running over and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m\nnever over there any more than four times a day at the most. (_Helen\ncomes in and Margaret rushes to embrace her._) Oh Helen, you dear girl!\nI\u2019m so glad to see you. I was just wishing you would come over. Do take\noff your hat and stay awhile. I\u2019ve just been so mad I could boil over\nor bite somebody or do something awful.\n\nHELEN\u2014Why, what is the matter with you? What are you mad about?\n(_Aside, It seems to me she is always in hot water or a stew about\nsomething._)\n\nMARGARET\u2014Well, sit down and I\u2019ll tell you about it. (_They sit down\non a couch._) It seems that dad has some country relations somewhere\nin the backwoods. He\u2019s had them ever since he was born but he\u2019s just\nremembering them now. Well, it seems that there\u2019s a girl about my age\nand dad was looking over some old photos last night and came across one\nof her when she was six years old. That picture put him into the notion\nthat he would like to see that girl and nothing will do but I must\nwrite and ask her up.\n\nHELEN\u2014That won\u2019t hurt you, will it? I think it would be nice to have a\ngirl visiting you. I know when Marian Staddon was visiting me, we had a\ndandy time\u2014parties, dances, and heaps of things.\n\nMARGARET\u2014Yes, but can\u2019t you get anything into your head? This is a\ncousin from the _backwoods_ and just imagine the kind of figure she\u2019d\ncut in our set! Why, she\u2019ll likely have the oddest clothes and speak\nmost horrible English and, and\u2014not know beans. And then that would\nspoil all our plans for getting in with Edith Browning. The Brownings,\nyou know, are such an aristocratic family and are the whole cheese\nsince they moved to the city. I\u2019m just crazy to get in with them, but\nof course if they saw me with that girl, that would spoil everything.\nEdith would know that my father had sprung from common ordinary farmers\nand we have just succeeded in making people think we had very important\nancestors.\n\nHELEN\u2014(_aside_) Gee! but isn\u2019t she some snob. Well, nobody is deceived\nI can vouch for that. (_aloud._) I know Edith Browning is the whole\nthing just at present. I\u2019ve met her several times and think she is\nlovely, (_pause_) not a bit stuck up, you know. Of course we want to\nget in with her, especially this winter when Beth Norton is going to\nvisit her, for everybody will be having parties and things for her.\n\nMARGARET\u2014And pray, who is Beth Norton?\n\nHELEN\u2014Don\u2019t you know? Why, she is the girl that all the girls at\nErskine College were just crazy about. Why, they say there\u2019s never\nbeen a girl there before who was as popular. And act! Why, she took\nthe chief parts in all their plays and the girls said she had any\nprofessional actress beaten all to pieces. Oh yes, we must manage to\nget in with them if we can. Now about your cousin, say, why can\u2019t you\nhave her up for just a couple of days and keep her out of the way?\n\nMARGARET\u2014Dad is bound that I\u2019ll invite her up for two weeks anyway. I\ncan generally manage him pretty well, but this time he\u2019s as obstinate\nas a mule. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t inherit his bad qualities.\n\nHELEN\u2014(_aside_) I think she has all of his and some of her own to boot,\n(_aloud_) I have an idea. Write her such a letter that if she has any\nsense at all she\u2019ll know she\u2019s not wanted and then perhaps she won\u2019t\ncome.\n\nMARGARET\u2014(_jumping up_) That _is_ a good idea! Let\u2019s write it now. What\nshall we put into it? (_goes to a table where there is paper and ink,\nsits down to write_)\n\nHELEN\u2014(_going to the table_) Tell her that,\u2014oh, I don\u2019t know. You\nought to be good at that sort of thing. (_Margaret looks up sharply_).\nWriting letters I mean. You can write such splendid ones, you know.\n(_Margaret writes awhile while Helen looks over her shoulder._)\n\nMARGARET\u2014(_rising_) There, that ought to do the trick. What do you\nthink of it?\n\nHELEN\u2014Well, if she can\u2019t take the hint from that that she\u2019s not wanted,\nshe must be as dense as a\u2014a fog! (_goes to put on her hat._) I must go\nfor I promised to stay only a few minutes. Good-bye (_goes towards the\ndoor_) I hope your cousin won\u2019t be too boorish if she does come.\n\nMARGARET\u2014Good-bye. We\u2019ll trust to luck. (_Helen disappears. Margaret\ncomes to centre of stage_) Well, that letter _is_ a good stunt, but my,\nwouldn\u2019t dad be angry if he knew! But I\u2019ll chance it that he doesn\u2019t\nfind out. Now for a toast. (_Pretends to drink._) Here\u2019s to the refusal\nof my invitation to my country cousin.\n\n\nCURTAIN\n\n\n\n\nSCENE II\n\n\n(_A country kitchen. Elizabeth in middy and skirt, enters slowly toward\ncentre of stage, examining an envelope._)\n\nELIZABETH\u2014(_still examining envelope._) I wonder who this letter\u2019s\nfrom. I don\u2019t know the writing and it\u2019s from New York City. But there\u2019s\nlot of people I know there. Perhaps it\u2019s from one of those little girls\nat Erskine College that were always getting a crush on us bigger girls\nand bothering us to death with their gushing. Now, who is it from\nanyway? (_laughing._) Say, I never thought of it, but perhaps if I\nopened it I\u2019d find out. (_Opens and glances over it, and seems amazed\nand reads very slowly aloud._)\n\n                             14 Riverside Drive, New York City.\n\n    Dear Cousin Elizabeth:\n\n    Father wished me to write and ask you to visit us for a\n    couple of weeks. I know that you really wouldn\u2019t want\n    to come as you\u2019d feel so shy and awkward in a city home\n    and among the girls in our set and doubtless you have\n    no clothes suitable for the city; but as he wished me\n    to ask you, I have done so.\n\n                                 Yours truly,\n                                         Margaret Neilson.\n\n(_Elizabeth looks up bewildered._)\n\nELIZABETH\u2014What a queer letter! I wonder if any of the girls are playing\na trick on me. (_thinks._) Now, I have it. I\u2019ve heard mother mention\nher brother, Jerry Neilson, who went to the city and his aristocratic\nwife made him cut his country relations when they got rich. So this\nmust be from my cousin. But how could any girl write such a rude,\ninsolent letter like that! She certainly was forced to write against\nher will. I bet her father never saw that letter. It would serve her\nright if I sent it to him. I\u2019d feel out of place in a city home and in\nher set! Well, (_laughing_) that\u2019s a joke, when I\u2019ve been in some of\nthe best homes in New York City. I wonder what Edith Browning would say\nto that and a lot of the other girls at dear old Erskine. Well, my dear\ncousin, I\u2019ll just write you a polite note of refusal.\n\n(_Goes to table and writes, then reads aloud_).\n\n\u201cMiss Edith Norton regrets with pleasure the sincerely cordial and\nhospitable invitation of Miss Margaret Neilson.\u201d Oh, (_suddenly\njumping and clapping her hands._) I\u2019ve an idea! I\u2019ll accept my kind\nand hospitable cousin\u2019s invitation since she\u2019s so anxious to have me\nand since she expects me to be such a queer freak from the backwoods,\nit would be too bad to disappoint her, so I\u2019ll dress and act the part\nof the poor country cousin she\u2019s looking for. Oh, (_dancing around_)\nit will be heaps of fun. I\u2019ll stay there a day and then I\u2019ll pay Edith\nBrowning that visit I\u2019ve promised her for ages. (_Going towards the\nexit._) The girls at Erskine always said I was a born actress and now\nI\u2019ll have the chance to prove whether they were just flattering me\nor not. (_Stops and glances at the address, 14 Riverside Drive._)\nWhy, Mildred Ewing lives just a couple houses from there. I\u2019ll dress\nthere and just slip over when the coast is clear. There\u2019s some of my\nmasquerade costumes up in the attic. I\u2019ll run and see if I can find\nsomething suitable for my new role. Say, but won\u2019t I lead my dear\ncousin a merry dance! (_Laughs and runs off the stage._)\n\n\nCURTAIN\n\n\n\n\nSCENE III\n\n(_Sitting room in Neilson\u2019s house. Margaret is seated doing fancywork.\nHelen comes in and Margaret rushes to meet her._)\n\n\nHELEN\u2014Say, what\u2019s up now that you had to have me come over in such a\nhurry? Have you any startling news? (_Both go towards centre._)\n\nMARGARET\u2014Oh Helen, I\u2019m in a terrible fix and all over that awful letter\nyou made me write to\u2014\n\nHELEN\u2014(_interrupting indignantly._) I made you write!\n\nMARGARET\u2014Yes, to Elizabeth\u2014or Lizzie as I guess she\u2019s called. Would you\never think she\u2019d accept that invitation?\n\nHELEN\u2014No, she hasn\u2019t, has she?\n\nMARGARET\u2014Yes, she has and here\u2019s her answer. (_shows her a letter\nwritten on some very brightly colored paper or wrapping paper._) Just\nlook at the spelling and the style! Wouldn\u2019t it crimp you? And just\nwait until I read it to you (_begins to read, while Helen follows her\nover her shoulder and giggles all through the reading of it._)\n\n    Dear Maggie\u2014(_Isn\u2019t that abominable?_)\u2014\n\n    I\u2019ve been wanting ter visit the city ever since I was\n    skin high to a grasshopper, but didn\u2019t know I had any\n    kin in the city that I could visit. It\u2019s awferlly kind\n    of youse to ask me and I\u2019ll be there as sure as guns\n    this coming Wednesday. I jest got some new clothes made\n    by Susannah Sparks and they\u2019re mighty stylish, I kin\n    tell yer. I aint a bit bashful so youse kin invite all\n    the people in youse like. I\u2019d like ter meet yer friends\n    awful well. Remember me to yer pap.\n\n                                 Yers to a sliver,\n                                          Lizzie Norton.\n\n(_throws the letter down on the table in disgust and makes a face._)\nIsn\u2019t that perfectly awful? That means she\u2019ll be here to-morrow and oh,\nshe must be dreadful! And what if she should tell dad about that awful\nletter we wrote! Oh, why did I do it, and whatever will I do? (_Sinks\ndown in chair and begins to cry._)\n\nHELEN\u2014(_going over and putting her arm around her._) Oh, cheer up!\nThings might be worse. You can manage to avoid the girls for awhile\nand you can give Lizzie books to read or something to keep her in the\nbackground and out of mischief.\n\nMARGARET\u2014(_drying her eyes._) It\u2019s a good thing she isn\u2019t coming today\nfor you know I\u2019ve invited Edith Browning for tea and I want to be on my\nbest behavior and be as nice as I can so as to make a good impression.\nIf Lizzie were here, I would be mortified to death. (_bell rings behind\nstage._) Oh, there\u2019s the bell. It\u2019s too early for Edith. I wonder who\nit is. (_goes to the door and looks out._) There\u2019s Nora answering the\ndoor now. (_throws up her hands in horror._) Good heavens, who can that\nawful person be!\n\nHELEN\u2014What person? (_Goes and looks too and giggles._) Goodness, I bet\nshe\u2019s escaped from some asylum. But listen, Nora\u2019s going to settle her.\n(_both listen at door._)\n\nNORA\u2014(_behind the scenes_) Yez can\u2019t come in here. This is no place for\nthe likes of ye. Ye\u2019d better thry the asylum where ye belong.\n\nELIZABETH\u2014(_behind the scenes_) Yer\u2019d better go there yerself. Let me\ntell yer that I kin come in if I want ter. I\u2019ve come to visit my Uncle\nJerry and yer needn\u2019t think a red-haired freckled flip of a thing like\nyer can stop me. Now stop making a door of yerself and let me through\nor I\u2019ll tell my cousin Maggie on yer.\n\nHELEN\u2014Good heavens, here she comes! (_Drags Margaret to front of stage\nwhere they both fall limp into chairs._)\n\nMARGARET\u2014Merciful powers, it\u2019s Lizzie! Isn\u2019t she\u2014(_Elizabeth appears at\ndoor, dressed in a most ridiculous fashion and carries an old-fashioned\ntelescope and a big satchel. Both girls sit staring at her._)\n\nELIZABETH\u2014(_Rushing up to them and throwing down her telescope_)\nHelloa, girls! Be one of youse my cousin Maggie? I\u2019m Lizzie Norton. I\ngot a chance ter come up a day earlier so I didn\u2019t think it would make\nany odds. (_The girls have jumped to their feet thunder-struck._)\n\nELIZABETH\u2014(_looks from one to the other_) Say, what\u2019s the matter with\nyouse? Be youse both deef and dumb?\n\nMARGARET\u2014(_extending her hand which Elizabeth seizes_) I\u2019m _Margaret_\nNeilson so I suppose you must be my cousin Lizzie. We were not\nexpecting you until to-morrow. (_Aside to Helen._) Oh, Helen, isn\u2019t she\nperfectly dreadful?\n\nHELEN\u2014(_aside to Margaret_) Well, I should say! And her clothes sure\nare the latest style as there\u2019s never been any like them\u2014yet!\n\nELIZABETH\u2014(_tugging at the elastic on her hat_) Well, youse didn\u2019t tell\nme ter take off my hat, but I guess I\u2019ll make myself ter hum. (_Takes\noff her hat and throws it on the couch and stares around._) My, aint\neverything here perfectly grand! (_Goes around the room._) Youse folks\nmust be pretty stylish. Now, ter home us folks aint never seen such\nnice things. (_Turns suddenly._) Say, how\u2019s Uncle Jerry, Maggie?\n\nMARGARET\u2014If you\u2019re referring to my father, his name is J. Ernest\nNeilson, so please call him Uncle Ernest. As for myself, I detest the\nname of Maggie. _Do_ call me Margaret.\n\nELIZABETH\u2014Oh, yer rather peppery aint yer? I\u2019m sure Jerry is just as\ngood a name as yer kin find anywhere. Why, we named our old white horse\nthat and a better horse yer couldn\u2019t have. As for Maggie, our black\nand white spotted cow is called that and she gives more milk than any\nof them. (_Margaret looks more and more disgusted and Helen amused._)\nSay, aint you going to interduce me to your friend? At hum we always\ninterduce everybody to everybody else.\n\nMARGARET\u2014I beg your pardon. This is my friend, Miss Helen Montgomery.\n(_Helen raises her hand very high and Elizabeth pulls it down and\nshakes it heartily._)\n\nELIZABETH\u2014Please ter meet you, Helly. I suspect I\u2019ll get real\nacquainted with yer before my visit\u2019s over. Yer don\u2019t look quite as\nstuck-uppish as my cousin there. (_Margaret makes a face while Helen\nlaughs._)\n\nHELEN\u2014I feel greatly complimented, I\u2019m sure. (_Aside_) She\u2019s summed up\nMargaret pretty well for a green country girl.\n\nELIZABETH\u2014(_examining the girl\u2019s clothes_) Say, girls, yer dressed up\nmighty swell. Be yer going to a party?\n\nMARGARET\u2014(_proudly_) Why, no, these are just our every-day clothes.\n\nELIZABETH\u2014(_in surprise_). You don\u2019t say! (_Smoothing down her own\ndress proudly._) Don\u2019t you like my new dress? (_Margaret looks\ndisdainful._) I was bound to have Susannah make it stylish and put in\nall the pleats and frills she could. I think she made a real good job\nof it, don\u2019t youse?\n\nHELEN\u2014(_sarcastically_) Why, yes, I think it is beautiful (_looking\nat Elizabeth\u2019s hat_) and what a lovely hat you have and so becoming.\n(_Turns her back to laugh._)\n\nELIZABETH\u2014(_getting the hat and turning it around in her hand_) Yes, I\nthink it mighty nice and so should it be for it was awferlly expensive.\nI paid $1.98 for the shape itself at (_names a local milliner_) and\nI trimmed it myself. (_Puts it back on sofa. Helen and Margaret sit\ndown._)\n\nHELEN\u2014(_aside_) It wouldn\u2019t need a detective to make that discovery,\nthat\u2019s one thing sure.\n\nELIZABETH\u2014(_unfastening satchel and taking out a gaily colored\ncentre-piece_) Now, I\u2019ll jest set down and work at this centre-piece.\n(_Sits down in rocking chair and works._) I\u2019m going to give it to you,\nMag\u2014_Margaret_, I mean, for yer parler table.\n\nMARGARET\u2014(_aside_) Oh, gee, imagine that on our highly polished table.\nI guess it will be more likely to adorn the attic. (_aloud_) Oh, that\u2019s\nvery nice of you. By the way, how did you find your way here?\n\nHELEN\u2014Oh yes, how did you when you had never been in the city before?\n\nELIZABETH\u2014Well, now, I did have a mighty hard time of it at first. I\nasked one of them policemen if he could tell me where Uncle Jer\u2014where\nMr. J. Ernest Neilson lived and he just laughed at me. (_She keeps\nrocking._)\n\nHELEN\u2014Well, I should think he would. Didn\u2019t you know any better than\nthat?\n\nELIZABETH\u2014(_still sewing_) Why, I was told that them policemen could\nanswer any kind of a question. At hum everybody knows where everybody\nelse lives so I thought it would be the same here. (_Both girls\nlaugh._) Anyway he asked what his address was and I showed him the top\nof yer letter.\n\nMARGARET\u2014(_in horror_) You didn\u2019t show him my letter!\n\nELIZABETH\u2014Sure and he must have got a good squint at what was in it,\ntoo, for he looked so funny. Well he told me to get into one of them\nstreet car things, and the feller who was all dressed up in brass\nbuttons and took the tickets told me when to get into another so it was\nreal easy. But I think the people here are dreadfully imperlite. They\nkept giggling and giggling. I asked one what the joke was and she grew\nawfully red and didn\u2019t answer. I think it\u2019s mighty rude not to tell\nother folks the joke, why down to hum\u2014(_looks up just as the girls are\nturning up their noses_). Say, what\u2019s the matter with your noses? Have\nthey nervous twitches in them? Get a bottle of Dr. Cure-all\u2019s syrup of\ntar at (_name of local druggist_) and it will soon stop that for it\ncured my cold. (_Rising and throwing fancy work on chair._) Laws a me,\nI\u2019m awfully thirsty. Where\u2019s the kitchen (_goes towards door, Margaret\nstarts up_). Never mind coming. I\u2019ll just use the dipper so you don\u2019t\nneed to get me a glass.\n\nMARGARET\u2014Well, tell Nora to get you a drink. (_Exit Elizabeth_). Oh\nHelen, I never saw anybody so common\u2014\n\nHELEN\u2014(_interrupting_). Why she\u2019s the most _un_common specimen I ever\nmet in all my life.\n\nMARGARET\u2014(_proceeding_)\u2014and horrid before\u2014and oh, (_jumping up in\nconsternation_), I forgot all about Edith coming. She\u2019ll be here soon\nnow and I simply must get Lizzie out of the way before she comes. Oh\nHelen, (_putting her arm around her_), hurry up and think up something\nto help me out of this hole.\n\nHELEN\u2014(_aside_), And she was so grateful when I tried to help her the\nlast time. But she\u2019s in a pretty tight box now so I guess I\u2019ll have\nto try and patch it up. I wish her _important ancestors_ had given\nher some brains. (_Aloud._) Oh, tell her\u2014tell her\u2014. Now let me think\n(_thinks for a minute and suddenly grabs Margaret\u2019s arm_). I have it.\nTell her that you know she must be very tired after her long journey\nand that you\u2019re sure she would like to rest and have tea quietly in\nher own room. Nora could take it up on a tray. Lizzie will think it\u2019s\nso considerate of you, I\u2019m pretty sure, and the novelty of having\nthings sent up to her might appeal to her. Let\u2019s try it anyway.\n\nMARGARET\u2014All right. I\u2019d try anything. (_Elizabeth appears._) But here\nshe comes now. (_Elizabeth comes toward centre and Margaret goes to\nmeet her and puts her arm around Elizabeth\u2019s waist_). Oh Lizzie, I know\nyou must be pretty tired after your long journey. I think perhaps you\nhad better rest quietly until tea time. Then I\u2019ll tell Nora to fix you\nup a nice dainty tray and you\u2019ll be under no nervous strain at all.\n\nELIZABETH\u2014Me tired after that speck of a ride on the train! Why I\u2019ve\nsaw me walk five miles ter town and go home and milk ten cows and not\nbe a bit the worse for it. And talk about nerves. Well I may be _nervy_\nbut I aint got them nerves that make people act like sillies. Now I\u2019ll\njust go up and put on my red chiny silk dress Susannah fixed up that\nstylish with yeller bows and six frills and point de spit lace. It will\nonly take me a few minutes and I\u2019ll be down in lots of time for supper.\n(_Gets valise and goes towards exit, then stops at one end of stage_),\n(_Aside_), I guess it\u2019s time that I ended this farce. I think I\u2019ve\ngiven my dear cousin a pretty strong jolt, judging from her face and\nactions. Gee, she\u2019s the limit all right. Anyway, I had better change\ninto a decent dress as I would hate to offend Uncle Jerry\u2014I mean _Uncle\nJ. Ernest Neilson_ (_exit Elizabeth_).\n\n(_Margaret sits moodily in chair with head propped on knees. Helen sits\ntoying with some fancy work._)\n\nHELEN\u2014For goodness sake, Margaret, cheer up, you\u2019re not dead yet!\n\nMARGARET\u2014I wish I were. What am I going to do? and Edith is due any\nminute. I wonder what made Lizzie strike today.\n\nHELEN\u2014(_explosively_) Well, do you know, I like her!\n\nMARGARET\u2014(_in surprise_) Do you really? Well, I believe I do myself.\nThere\u2019s something rather refreshing about her and she\u2019s so frank and\ngood-natured. She doesn\u2019t bear the least grudge for that horrid letter\nwe sent. Perhaps she doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with it though. Oh,\nwhatever made me do it? I feel as mean as dirt everytime I think of it.\nI\u2019d give anything if I had never written it.\n\nHELEN\u2014Yes, I guess it was pretty shabby, but what\u2019s done cannot be\nundone. Anyway, I don\u2019t suppose she knows enough to take offense at it.\n(_Starting up._) Oh, I have an idea!\n\nMARGARET\u2014(_moodily_), I notice that you do catch on to one once in a\nwhile. Well let\u2019s hear it.\n\nHELEN\u2014(_aside in disgust_) Now, wouldn\u2019t that crimp you! She couldn\u2019t\nfind an idea all by herself in a thousand years. (_Aloud_). Why, I was\njust thinking that Lizzie would look quite pretty if she had a decent\ndress to wear and was fixed up some. Now, what\u2019s to hinder you lending\nher one of your pretty dresses and doing her hair in some becoming\nfashion? I bet she wouldn\u2019t look bad at all.\n\nMARGARET\u2014Why, she wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019ll go right up now and do it (_starts\ntoward exit_), or she\u2019ll be coming down in some awful concoction of a\ndress. Oh, dear, I feel awfully nervous.\n\nHELEN\u2014Did you hear what she said about nerves? The very idea, when\nnerves are all the go now. (_Bell rings_). Oh, there\u2019s Edith now. I\nwish she had stayed away for half an hour longer.\n\nMARGARET\u2014So do I. And however will I manage to fix Lizzie up now?\n\nHELEN\u2014Talk for a few minutes and then excuse yourself and I\u2019ll\nentertain Edith until you come back.\n\nMARGARET\u2014(_warmly_) Helen, you\u2019re a dear and just full of ideas. I\ndon\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you. (_Goes out_).\n\nHELEN\u2014(_aside dramatically_), Behold the expanding of Miss Margaret\nNeilson\u2019s character. She is actually wakening up to what I am trying to\ndo for her and has even expressed one grain of gratitude. Well I guess\nI\u2019ll hang on to the grain, perhaps it will sprout. (_Sees Lizzie\u2019s hat\nand fancy work._) Goodness I\u2019d better get these out of sight or they\u2019d\nbe a sure giveaway. (_Runs and thrusts fancy work under a cushion and\nthrows hat behind couch. Margaret appears arm in arm with Edith who is\nwell but quietly dressed. Helen goes to meet them._)\n\nMARGARET\u2014You know Helen Montgomery don\u2019t you, Miss Browning?\n\nEDITH\u2014Oh call me Edith, it\u2019s more sociable and I\u2019ll call you Margaret.\nWhy yes, (_shaking hands with Helen_), I have met you several times,\nhaven\u2019t I? Coming to a new city it takes a person quite awhile to get\nacquainted, but I\u2019m managing not too badly.\n\nHELEN\u2014Why, I should say not. You have made hosts of friends already\nfrom all accounts.\n\nEDITH\u2014Yes, everybody has been awfully kind to me and then I\u2019d met\nseveral people when I was at Erskine. (_All girls take seats, Edith\nsitting where she can see the exit by turning slightly._) I hope you\ngirls weren\u2019t expecting me any sooner. I had some shopping to do and\nthat delayed me.\n\nMARGARET\u2014Oh, that\u2019s all right, but we were just saying we wish you\u2019d\nhurry up so that we could have a nice, long chat about everything\nbefore supper, so\u2014\n\nHELEN\u2014(_interrupting_) Oh, Edith, do tell us about some of the jolly\ntimes you had at Erskine College. I\u2019m just aching to hear about them.\n(_Draws chair closer to Edith_).\n\nMARGARET\u2014Yes, please do! (_Draws her chair closer_).\n\nEDITH\u2014Why, I could tell you lots, but really I wouldn\u2019t know where to\nbegin and once I began, I wouldn\u2019t know where to stop. For one thing\nwe used to have midnight suppers whenever one of the girls would get a\nbox from home. We\u2019d all meet in one room and have nothing but candles\nfor a light and when we heard anyone coming, we would have to blow them\nout, quick as wink. Oh, but it was exciting when we heard any footsteps\noutside! There\u2019d be a wild scamper, I can tell you.\n\nHELEN AND MARGARET\u2014I guess there would be. What would you do?\n\nEDITH\u2014Everybody would grab the first thing that came handy and we\u2019d\nmake ourselves as small as possible. We\u2019d squeeze four or five into bed\nwith the eats and a few under while the rest would get into a closet.\nOne of the girls would snore and the teacher would think she was asleep\nand pass on. It was pretty hard on the eats, though, being grabbed\nin such a hurry and getting all crushed up, but then it was lots of\nexcitement and fun.\n\nHELEN\u2014What else did you do?\n\nEDITH\u2014Well, we put on some pretty good amateur plays. Beth Norton, was\nsimply grand in anything like that. Say, (_with enthusiasm_) you just\nought to know Beth. She\u2019s the dearest girl out. Everybody raved over\nher at Erskine. She was just bubbling over with fun and mischief and\nkept things lively all the time. She was so good-hearted and kind too\nand had the most forgiving nature. One girl said she was so full of fun\nthat there wasn\u2019t a speck of room for spite to lodge in.\n\nMARGARET\u2014She must be lovely. I\u2019d like awfully well to meet her.\n\nEDITH\u2014Well, I don\u2019t see why you couldn\u2019t for I just got a letter from\nher and she said she was going to visit me in a couple days. She said\nshe was visiting some snobbish cousin of hers who needs to be taken\ndown a peg or two. I\u2019d love to see her do it, but I wouldn\u2019t like to be\nthe cousin, I can tell you.\n\nMARGARET\u2014No, nor I either, but those people who put on such airs ought\nto have it taken out of them some way or other. I wonder who she is.\n\nEDITH\u2014I don\u2019t know. Beth wouldn\u2019t think of giving her away. (_Helen\nstares fixedly at Margaret and nods. Margaret rises_).\n\nMARGARET\u2014I wonder if you\u2019d excuse me for a few minutes. I have some\nthings I must attend to.\n\nEDITH\u2014Why of course. Don\u2019t hurry back. (_Gazes at Margaret starting to\ngo out. Elizabeth appears at exit very daintily dressed._)\n\nEDITH\u2014(_rushing past Margaret seizes Elizabeth and hugs her_), Why\nBeth, you dear girl, (_pulls her towards centre_), wherever did you\ncome from? The girls were just saying they didn\u2019t know you. (_Margaret\nand Helen both stand in amazement._) That\u2019s funny.\n\nELIZABETH\u2014Oh, helloa Edith! I didn\u2019t know you knew my cousin. I\u2019m just\nstaying here until to-morrow and then I\u2019m going to your place for\nawhile.\n\nEDITH\u2014(_aside in horror_), So this Margaret Neilson is the snob Beth\nis to take down a peg. Good gracious, but I\u2019ve put my foot into it.\n(_Edith and Beth go to one side and eagerly converse in low tones_).\n\nMARGARET\u2014(_to Helen_), Lizzie, Beth Norton! Why whatever does it mean\nanyway? (_thinks_), How can she be one and the same person? Oh, oh, I\nsee it now. The names are both nicknames and I never imagined my cousin\nElizabeth was the much talked of Beth. And so I\u2019m the snob that Edith\nsaid Beth was to take down a peg! (_Pauses_) And the worst of it is I\nknow I deserve it after that horrible letter. I don\u2019t deserve to have\nher ever speak to me again.\n\nHELEN\u2014But, whatever did she mean by dressing up like that!\n\nMARGARET\u2014Why, don\u2019t you see? Didn\u2019t you say that when she acted, she\nhad all the professionals beaten to pieces? Well, she\u2019s acted that\ncountry gawk I inferred in that letter to take me down that peg. Gee,\nshe\u2019s taken me down a whole bunch of them. And oh look how we treated\nher since she came. Oh, Helen, I\u2019m so ashamed. I wish there was a hole\nin the floor so that I could crawl into it.\n\nHELEN\u2014(_aside_), Thank goodness, she\u2019s admitted that much. There\u2019s hope\nfor her yet. (_Aloud._) We both acted awfully mean and for my part I\u2019m\ngoing to take my pill and swallow it.\n\nMARGARET\u2014I will too. It\u2019s mighty bitter, but the worse the medicine\ntastes, as a rule, the better are the results. I\u2019ll never\u2014(_Elizabeth\ncomes up to her_).\n\nELIZABETH\u2014Well, Mag\u2014Margaret, I guess it\u2019s up to me to explain. You see\nwhen I got your letter which showed me so plainly that you considered\nany person brought up in the country was some sort of a curiosity\nand nothing but an ignoramus, I thought I would come and explain to\nyou that the farmers of today are among the best educated and most\nwealthy people there are and their daughters are receiving the very\nbest advantages that can be gotten. But when I read your letter over, I\ncouldn\u2019t resist the temptation of acting the awkward gawk of a specimen\nyou expected. Did I succeed?\n\nMARGARET\u2014Succeed! Oh goodness, it was awful. (_Sinks into a chair and\nstarts to cry_), Oh, Liz\u2014Beth, I mean. I know I\u2019ve been as nasty and\nsnobbish as I could. And you don\u2019t know how mean I\u2019ve felt ever since\nI wrote that awful, awful letter. I\u2019ve wished again and again that I\u2019d\nnever been so rude and horrid. Will you ever forgive me? (_Cries_).\n\nELIZABETH\u2014(_Putting her arm around her_), Oh, cheer up, Margaret, of\ncourse I\u2019ll forgive you; you just need some of your notions changed.\nThat\u2019s all. And when it comes to forgiving, perhaps I\u2019d better ask you\nto forgive me for playing such a trick on you. (_Aside, laughing_),\nBut, gee it was the best fun I\u2019ve had for ages. Their shocked faces!\n(_laugh_), their turned up noses, (_laughs_), their open disgust. Oh\nglory, it was worth a circus to see them.\n\nEDITH\u2014Well, let\u2019s forget everything that\u2019s been done and said and begin\nall over again. I think we\u2019ll be great friends. Let\u2019s shake over it.\n(_She takes Helen\u2019s hand, Elizabeth takes Margaret\u2019s and they stand\nwith crossed hands in front of stage_).\n\nELIZABETH\u2014Oh girls, see how our hands are crossed; I wonder who\u2019s going\nto be married first.\n\n\n    CURTAIN\n\n\n\n\nChristmas Entertainments\n\n\n=CHRISTMAS AT PUNKIN HOLLER.= A new Christmas play by Elizabeth F.\nGuptill that abounds in clean, wholesome fun from beginning to end.
