The grayish skin\nof his face seemed to fall in diagonal furrows, from the eyes, from the\nnose, from the mouth. He sat, still to his finger-tips, staring.\n\nHe was sitting so when a servant slipped in and stood motionless a\nminute, and went to the wide window where the west light glared through\nleafless branches outside, and drew the shades lower, and went to the\nfireplace and touched a match. Wood caught and crackled and a cheerful\norange flame flew noisily up the chimney, but the man sitting on the\ndivan did not notice. The butler waited a moment, watching, hesitating,\nand then:\n\n\"Have you had lunch, sir?\" he asked in a tentative, gentle voice.\n\nThe staring eyes moved with an effort and rested on the servant's face.\n\"Lunch?\" he repeated, apparently trying to focus on the meaning of the\nword. \"Lunch? I don't know, Miller. But don't bring anything.\"\n\nWith a great anxiety in his face Miller regarded his master. \"Would you\nlet me take your overcoat, Judge?--you'll be too warm,\" he said.\n\nHe spoke in a suppressed tone as if waiting for, fearing something, as\nif longing to show sympathy, and the man stood and let himself be cared\nfor, and then sat down again in the same unrestful, fixed attitude,\ngazing out again through the glittering panes into the stormy, tawny\nwest sky. Miller came back and stood quiet, patient; in a few minutes\nthe man seemed to become aware of him.\n\n\"I forgot, Miller. You'll want to know,\" he said in a tone which went to\nshow an old bond between the two. \"You'll be sorry to hear, Miller,\" he\nsaid--and the dull eyes moved difficultly to the anxious ones, and his\nvoice was uninflected--\"you'll be sorry to know that the coroner's jury\ndecided that Master Jack was a murderer.\"\n\nThe word came more horribly because of an air of detachment from the\nman's mind. It was like a soulless, evil mechanism, running unguided.\nMiller caught at a chair.\n\n\"I don't believe it, sir,\" he gasped. \"No lawyer shall make me. I've\nknown him since he was ten, Judge, and they're mistaken. It's not any\nmere lawyers can make me believe that awful thing, sir, of our Master\nJack.\" The servant was shaking from head to foot with intense rejection,\nand the man put up his hand as if to ward off his emotion.\n\n\"I wish I could agree with you,\" he said quietly, and then added, \"Thank\nyou, Miller.\" And the old butler, walking as if struck with a sickness,\nwas gone.\n\nThe man sat on the edge of the divan staring out of the window, minute\nafter minute; the November wind tossed the clean, black lines of the\nbranches backward and forward against the copper sky, as if a giant hand\nmoved a fan of sea-weed before a fire. The man sat still and stared. The\nsky dulled; the delicate, wild branches melted together; the diamond\nlines in the window blurred; yet, unmoved, unseeing, the eyes stared\nthrough them.\n\nThe burr of an electric bell sounded; some one came in at the front door\nand came to the door of the library, but the fixed figure did not stir.\nThe newcomer stood silent a minute, two minutes; a young man in clerical\ndress, boyish, with gray, serious eyes. At length he spoke.\n\n\"May I come in? It's Dick.\"\n\nThe man's head turned slowly and his look rested inquiringly on his\nnephew. It was a minute before he said, as if recognizing him, \"Dick.\nYes.\" And set himself as before to the persistent gazing through the\nwindow.\n\n\"I lost you at the court-house,\" the younger man said. \"I didn't mean to\nlet you come home alone.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Dick.\" It seemed as if neither joy nor sorrow would find a\nway into the quiet voice again.\n\nThe wind roared; the boughs rustled against the glass; the fire, soberly\nsettled to work, steamed and crackled; the clock ticked indifferently;\nthere was no other sound in the room; the two men were silent, the one\nstaring always before him, the other sitting with a hand on the older\nman's hand, waiting. Minutes they sat so, and the wintry sky outside\ndarkened and lay sullenly in bands of gray and orange against the\nwindows; the light of the logs was stronger than the daylight; it\nflickered carelessly across the ashiness of the emotionless face. The\nyoung man, watching the face, bent forward and gripped his other hand on\nthe unresponsive one in his clasp.\n\n\"Uncle,\" he asked, \"will it make things worse if I talk to you?\"\n\n\"No, Dick.\"\n\nNothing made a difference, it seemed. Silence or words must simply fall\nwithout effect on the rock bottom of despair. The young man halted, as\nif dismayed, before this overpowering inertia of hopelessness; he drew a\nquick breath.\n\n\"A coroner's jury isn't infallible. I don't believe it of Jack--a lot of\npeople don't believe it,\" he said.\n\nThe older man looked at him heavily. \"You'd say that. Jack's friends\nwill. I've been trained to weigh evidence--I must believe it.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" the young man urged. \"Don't shut down the gates like that. I'm\nnot a lawyer, but I've been trained to think, too, and I believe you're\nnot thinking squarely. There's other evidence that counts besides this.\nThere's Jack--his personality.\"\n\n\"It has been taken into consideration.\"\n\n\"It can't be taken into consideration by strangers--it needs years of\nintimacy to weigh that evidence as I can weigh it--as you--You know best\nof all,\" he cried out impulsively, \"if you'll let yourself know, how\nimpossible it was. That Jack should have bought that pistol and taken it\nto Ben Armstrong's rooms to kill him--it was impossible--impossible!\"\nThe clinched fist came down on the black broadcloth knee with the\nconviction of the man behind it. The words rushed like melted metal,\nhot, stinging, not to be stopped. The judge quivered as if they had\nstung through the callousness, touched a nerve. A faint color crawled\nto his cheeks; for the first time he spoke quickly, as if his thoughts\nconnected with something more than gray matter.\n\n\"You talk about my not allowing myself to believe in Jack. You seem\nnot to realize that such a belief would--might--stand between me and\nmadness. I've been trying to adjust myself to a possible scheme of\nliving--getting through the years till I go into nothingness. I can't.\nAll I can grasp is the feeling that a man might have if dropped from\na balloon and forced to stay gasping in the air, with no place in it,\nnothing to hold to, no breath to draw, no earth to rest on, no end to\nhope for. There is nothing beyond.\"\n\n\"Everything is beyond,\" the young man cried triumphantly. \"'The end,' as\nyou call it, is an end to hope for--it is the beginning. The beginning\nof more than you have ever had--with them, with the people you care\nabout.\"\n\nThe judge turned a ghastly look upon the impetuous, bright face. \"If\nI believed that, I should be even now perfectly happy. I don't see how\nyou Christians can ever be sorry when your friends die--it's childish;\nanybody ought to be able to wait a few years. But I don't believe it,\"\nhe said heavily, and went on again as if an inertia of speech were\ncarrying him as an inertia of silence had held him a few minutes before.\n\"When my wife died a year ago it ended my personal life, but I could\nlive Jack's life. I was glad in the success and honor of it. Now the\nsuccess--\" he made a gesture. \"And the honor--if I had that, only the\nhonor of Jack's life left, I think I could finish the years with\ndignity. I've not been a bad man--I've done my part and lived as seemed\nright. Before I'm old the joy is wiped out and long years left. Why?\nIt's not reasonable--not logical. With one thing to hold to, with Jack's\ngood name, I might live. How can I, now? What can I do? A life must have\na _raison d'etre._\"\n\n\"Listen,\" the clergyman cried again. \"You are not judging Jack as fairly\nas you would judge a common criminal. You know better than I how often\njuries make mistakes--why should you trust this jury to have made none?\"\n\n\"I didn't trust the jury. I watched as I have never before known how to\nwatch a case. I felt my mind more clear and alert than common.\"\n\n\"Alert!\" he caught at the word. \"But alert on the side of\nterror--abnormally clear to see what you dreaded. Because you are\nfair-minded, because it has been the habit of your life to correct at\nonce any conscious prejudice in your judgment, you have swayed to the\nside of unfairness to yourself, to Jack. Uncle,\" he flashed out, \"would\nit tear your soul to have me state the case as I see it? I might, you\nknow--I might bring out something that would make it look different.\"\n\nAlmost a smile touched the gray lines of his face. \"If you wish.\"\n\nThe young man drew himself into his chair and clasped his hands around\nhis knee. \"Here it is. Mr. Newbold, on the seventh floor of the Bruzon\nbachelor apartments, heard a shot at one in the morning, next his\nbedroom, in Ben Armstrong's room. He hurried into the public hall, saw\nthe door wide open into Ben's apartment, went in and found Ben shot\ndead. Trying to use the telephone to call help, he found it was out of\norder. So he rushed again into the hall toward the elevator with the\nidea of getting Dr. Avery, who lived below on the second floor. The\nelevator door was open also, and a man's opera-hat lay near it on the\nfloor; he saw, just in time, that the car was at the bottom of the\nshaft, almost stepping inside, in his excitement, before he noticed\nthis. Then he ran down the stairs with Jack's hat in his hand, and got\nDr. Avery, and they found Jack at the foot of the elevator shaft. It was\nknown that Ben Armstrong and Jack had quarrelled the day before; it was\nknown that Jack was quick-tempered; it is known that he bought that\nevening the pistol which was found on the floor by Ben, loaded, with one\nempty shell. That's the story.\"\n\nThe steady voice stopped a moment and the young man shivered slightly;\nhis look was strained. Steadily he went on.\n\n\"That's the story. From that the coroner's jury have found that Jack\nkilled Ben Armstrong--that he bought the pistol to kill him, and went\nto his rooms with that purpose; that in his haste to escape, he missed\nseeing that the elevator was down, as Mr. Newbold all but missed seeing\nit later, and jumped into the shaft and was killed instantly himself.\nThat's what the jury get from the facts, but it seems to me they're\nbegging the question. There are a hundred hypotheses that would fit\nthe case of Jack's innocence--why is it reasonable to settle on the\none that means his guilt? This is my idea. Jack and Ben Armstrong had\nbeen friends since boyhood and Jack, quick-tempered as he was, was\nwarm-hearted and loyal. It was like him to decide suddenly to go to Ben\nand make friends. He had been to a play in the evening which had more\nor less that _motif_; he was open to such influences. It was like\nthe pair of them, after the reconciliation, to set to work looking at\nJack's new toy, the pistol. It was a brand-new sort, and the two have\nbeen interested always in guns--I remember how I, as a youngster, was\nimpressed when Ben and Jack bought their first shot-guns together. Jack\nhad got the pistol at Mellingham's that evening, you know--he was likely\nto be keen about it still, and then--it went off. There are plenty of\nother cases where a man has shot his friend by accident--why shouldn't\npoor Jack be given the benefit of the doubt? The telephone wouldn't\nwork; Jack rushed out with the same idea which struck Mr. Newbold later,\nof getting Dr. Avery--and fell down the shaft.\n\n\"For me there is no doubt. I never knew him to hold malice. He was\nviolent sometimes, but that he could have gone about for hours with\na pistol in his pocket and murder in his heart; that he could have\nplanned Ben Armstrong's death and carried it out deliberately--it's\na contradiction in terms. It's impossible, being Jack. You must know\nthis--you know your son--you know human nature.\"\n\nThe rapid _resume_ was but an impassioned appeal. Its answer came\nafter a minute; to the torrent of eager words, three words:\n\n\"Thank you, Dick.\"\n\nThe absolute lack of impression on the man's judgment was plain.\n\n\"Ah!\" The clergyman sprang to his feet and stood, his eyes blazing,\ndespairing, looking down at the bent, listless figure. How could he let\na human being suffer as this one was suffering? Quickly his thoughts\nshifted their basis. He could not affect the mind of the lawyer; might\nhe reach now, perhaps, the soul of the man? He knew the difficulty,\nfor before this his belief had crossed swords with the agnosticism of\nhis uncle, an agnosticism shared by his father, in which he had been\ntrained, from which he had broken free only five years before. He had\nfaced the batteries of the two older brains at that time, and come out\nwith the brightness of his new-found faith untarnished, but without, he\nremembered, scratching the armor of their profound doubt in everything.\nOne could see, looking at the slender black figure, at the visionary\ngaze of the gray wide eyes, at the shape of the face, broad-browed,\novalled, that this man's psychic make-up must lift him like wings into\nan atmosphere outside a material, outside even an intellectual world.\nHe could breathe freely only in a spiritual air, and things hard to\nbelieve to most human beings were, perhaps, his every-day thoughts. He\ncaught a quick breath of excitement as it flashed to his brain that now,\npossibly, was coming the moment when he might justify his life, might\nhelp this man whom he loved, to peace. The breath he caught was a\nprayer; his strong, nervous fingers trembled. He spoke in a tone whose\nconcentration lifted the eyes below him, that brooded, stared.\n\n\"I can't bear it to stand by and see you go under, when there's help\nclose. You said that if you could believe that they were living, that\nyou would have them again, you would be perfectly happy no matter how\nmany years you must wait. They are living as sure as I am here, and as\nsure as Jack was here, and Jack's mother. They are living still. Perhaps\nthey're close to you now. You've bound a bandage over your eyes, you've\ncovered the vision of your spirit, so that you can't see; but that\ndoesn't make nothingness of God's world. It's there--here--close,\nmaybe. A more real world than this--this little thing.\" With a boyish\ngesture he thrust behind him the universe. \"What do we know about the\nearth, except effects upon our consciousness? It's all a matter of\ninference--you know that better than I. The thing we do know beyond\ndoubt is that we are each of us a something that suffers and is happy.\nHow is that something the same as the body--the body that gets old\nand dies--how can it be? You can't change thought into matter--not\nconceivably--everybody acknowledges that. Why should the thinking part\ndie then, because the material part dies? When the organ is broken is\nthe organist dead? The body is the hull, the covering, and when it has\ngrown useless it will fall away and the live seed in it will stand free\nto sunlight and air--just at the beginning of life, as a plant is when\nit breaks through earth in the spring. It's the seed in the ground,\nand it's the flower in the sunlight, but it's the same thing--the same\nlife--it is--it _is_.\" The boy's intensity of conviction shot like\na flame across the quiet room.\n\n\"It is the same thing with us too. The same spirit-substance underlies\nboth worlds and there is no separation in space, only in view-point.\nLife goes on--it's just transfigured. It's as if a bandage should be\nlifted from our eyes and we should suddenly see things in whose presence\nwe had been always.\"\n\nThe rushing, eager voice stopped. He bent and laid his hand on the older\nman's and stared at his face, half hidden now in the shadows of the\nlowering fire. There was no response. The heavy head did not lift and\nthe attitude was unstirred, hopeless. As if struck by a blow he sprang\nerect and his fingers shut hard. He spoke as if to himself, brokenly.\n\n\"He does not believe--a single word--I say. I can't help him--I\n_can't_ help him.\"\n\nSuddenly the clinched fists flung out as if of a power not their own,\nand his voice rang across the room.\n\n\"God!\" The word shot from him as if a thunderbolt fell with it. \"God!\nLift the bandage!\"\n\nA log fell with a crash into the fire; great battling shadows blurred\nall the air; he was gone.\n\nThe man, startled, drew up his bent shoulders, and pushed back a lock of\ngray hair and stared about, shaking, bewildered. The ringing voice, the\nword that had flashed as if out of a larger atmosphere--the place was\nyet full of these, and the shock of it added a keenness to his misery.\nHis figure swung sideways; he fell on the cushions of the sofa and his\narms stretched across them, his gray head lying heedless; sobs that tore\nroots came painfully; it was the last depth. Out of it, without his\nvolition, he spoke aloud.\n\n\"God, God, God!\" his voice said, not prayerfully, but repeating the\nsound that had shocked his torture. The word wailed, mocked, reproached,\ndefied--and yet it was a prayer. Out of a soul in mortal stress that\nword comes sometimes driven by a force of the spirit like the force of\nthe lungs fighting for breath--and it is a prayer.\n\n\"God, God, God!\" the broken voice repeated, and sobs cut the words. And\nagain. Over and over, and again the sobbing broke it.\n\nAs suddenly as if a knife had stopped the life inside the body, all\nsound stopped. A movement shook the man as he lay face down, arms\nstretched. Then for a minute, two minutes, he was quiet, with a quiet\nthat meant muscles stretched, nerves alert. Slowly, slowly the tightened\nmuscles of the arms pushed the shoulders backward and upward; the head\nlifted; the face turned outward, and if an observer had been there he\nmight have seen by the glow of the firelight that the features wet,\ndistorted, wore, more than all at this moment, a look of amazement.\nSlowly, slowly, moving as if afraid to disturb something--a dream--a\npresence--the man sat erect as he had been sitting before, only that the\nrigidity was in some way gone. He sat alert, his eyes wide, filled with\nastonishment, gazing before him eagerly--a look different from the dull\nstare of an hour ago by the difference between hope and despair. His\nhands caught at the stuff of the divan on either side and clutched it.\n\nAll the time the look of his face changed; all the time, not at once,\nbut by fast, startling degrees, the gray misery which had bound eyes and\nmouth and brow in iron dropped as if a cover were being torn off and a\nlight set free. Amazement, doubting, incredulous came first, and with\nthat eagerness, trembling and afraid. And then hope--and then the fear\nto hope. And hunger. He bent forward, his eyes peered into the quiet\nemptiness, his fingers gripped the cloth as if to anchor him to a\nwonder, to an unbelievable something; his body leaned--to something--and\nhis face now was the face of a starved man, of a man dying from thirst,\nwho sees food, water, salvation.\n\nAnd his face changed; a quality incredible was coming into it--joy. He\nwas transformed. Lines softened by magic; color came, and light in the\neyes; the first unbelief, the amazement, shifted surely, swiftly, and in\na flash the whole man shone, shook with rapture. He threw out before him\nhis arms, reaching, clasping, and from his radiant look the arms might\nhave held all happiness.\n\nA minute he stayed so with his hands stretched out, with face glowing,\nthen slowly, his eyes straining as if perhaps they followed a vision\nwhich faded from them--slowly his arms fell and the expectancy went from\nhis look. Yet not the light, not the joy. His body quivered; his breath\ncame unevenly, as of one just gone through a crisis; every sense seemed\nstill alive to catch a faintest note of something exquisite which\nvanished; and with that the spell, rapidly as it had come, was gone.\nAnd the man sat there quiet, as he had sat an hour before, and the face\nwhich had been leaden was brilliant. He stirred and glanced about the\nroom as if trying to adjust himself, and his eyes smiled as they rested\non the familiar objects, as if for love of them, for pleasure in them.\nOne might have said that this man had been given back at a blow youth\nand happiness. Movement seemed beyond him yet--he was yet dazed with the\nnewness of a marvel--but he turned his head and saw the fire and at that\nput out his hand to it as if to a friend.\n\nThe electric bell burred softly again through the house, and the man\nheard it, and his eyes rested inquiringly on the door of the library. In\na moment another man stood there, of his own age, iron-gray,\nstrong-featured.\n\n\"Dick told me I might come,\" he said. \"Shall I trouble you? May I stay\nwith you awhile?\"\n\nThe judge put out his hand friendlily, a little vaguely, much as he had\nput it out to the fire. \"Surely,\" he said, and the newcomer was all at\nonce aware of his look. He started.\n\n\"You're not well,\" he said. \"You must take something--whiskey--Miller----\"\n\nThe butler moved in the room making lights here and there, and he came\nquickly.\n\n\"No,\" the judge said. \"I don't want anything--I don't need anything.\nIt's not as you think. I'll tell you about it.\"\n\nMiller was gone; Dick's father waited, his gaze fixed on the judge's\nface anxiously, and for moments no word was spoken. The judge gazed into\nthe fire with the rapt, smiling look which had so startled his\nbrother-in-law. At length:\n\n\"I don't know how to tell you,\" he said. \"There seem no words. Something\nhas happened, yet it's difficult to explain.\"\n\n\"Something happened?\" the other repeated, bewildered but guarded. \"I\ndon't understand. Has some one been here? Is it about--the trial?\"\n\n\"No.\" A slight spasm twisted the smiling lines of the man's mouth, but\nit was gone and the mouth smiled still.\n\nA horror-struck expression gleamed for a second from the anxious eyes of\nthe brother-in-law, but he controlled it quickly. He spoke gently. \"Tell\nme about it--it will do you good to talk.\"\n\nThe judge turned from the fire, and at sight of his flushed cheeks and\nlighted eyes the other shrank back, and the judge saw it. \"You needn't\nbe alarmed,\" he said quietly. \"Nothing is wrong with me. But something\nhas happened, as I told you, and everything--is changed.\" His eyes\nlifted as he spoke and strayed about the room as if considering a change\nwhich had come also to the accustomed setting.\n\nA shock of pity flashed from the other, and was mastered at once. \"Can\nyou tell me what has happened?\" he urged. The judge, his face bright\nwith a brightness that was dreadful to the man who watched him, held his\nhand to the fire, turning it about as if enjoying the warmth. The other\nshivered. There was silence for a minute. The judge broke it, speaking\nthoughtfully:\n\n\"Suppose you had been born blind, Ned,\" he began, \"and no one had ever\ngiven you a hint of the sense of vision, and your imagination had never\npresented such a power to your mind. Can you suppose that?\"\n\n\"I think so--yes,\" the brother-in-law answered, with careful gentleness,\nwatching always the illumined countenance. \"Yes, I can suppose it.\"\n\n\"Then fancy if you will that all at once sight came, and the world\nflashed before you. Do you think you'd be able to describe such an\nexperience?\"\n\nThe voice was normal, reflective. Many a time the two had talked\ntogether of such things in this very room, and the naturalness of the\nscene, and of the judge's manner, made the brother-in-law for a second\nforget the tragedy in which they were living.\n\n\"Why, of course,\" he answered. \"If one had never heard of such a power\none's vocabulary wouldn't take in the words to describe it.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" the judge agreed. \"That's the point I'm making. Perhaps now I\nmay tell you what it is that has happened. Or rather, I may make you\nunderstand how a definite and concrete event has come to pass, which I\ncan't tell you.\"\n\nAlarm suddenly expressed itself beyond control in the brother-in-law's\nface. \"John, what do you mean? Do you see that you distress me? Can't\nyou tell clearly if some one has been here--what it is, in plain\nEnglish, that has happened?\"\n\nThe judge turned his dreamy, bright look toward the frightened man. \"I\ndo see--I do see,\" he brought out affectionately. \"I'll try to tell, as\nyou say, in plain English. But it is like the case I put--it is a\nquestion of lack of vocabulary. A remarkable experience has occurred in\nthis room within an hour. I can no more describe it than the man born\nblind could describe sight. I can only call it by one name, which may\nstartle you. A revelation.\"\n\n\"A revelation!\" the tone expressed incredulity, scarcely veiled scorn.\n\nThe judge's brilliant gaze rested undisturbed on the speaker. \"I\nunderstand--none better. A day ago, two hours ago, I should have\nanswered in that tone. We have been trained in the same school, and have\nthought alike. Dick was here a while ago and said things--you know what\nDick would say. You know how you and I have been sorry for the lad--been\nindulgent to him--with his keen, broad mind and that inspired\nself-forgetfulness of his--how we've been sorry to have such qualities\nwasted on a parson, a religion machine. We've thought he'd come around\nin time, that he was too large a personality to be tied to a treadmill.\nWe've thought that all along, haven't we? Well, Dick was here, and out\nof the hell where I was I thought that again. When he talked I thought\nin a way--for I couldn't think much--that after a consistent voyage of\nagnosticism, I wouldn't be whipped into snivelling belief at the end, by\nshipwreck. I would at least go down without surrendering. In a dim way I\nthought that. And all that I thought then, and have thought through my\nlife, is nothing. Reasoning doesn't weigh against experience. Dick is\nright.\"\n\nThe other man sat before him, bent forward, his hands on his knees,\nlistening, dazed. There was a quality in the speaker's tone which made\nit necessary to take his words seriously. Yet--the other sighed and\nrelaxed a bit as he waited, watched. The calm voice went on.\n\n\"The largest event of my life has happened in the last hour, in this\nroom. It was this way. When Dick went out I--went utterly to pieces.\nIt was the farthest depth. Out of it I called on God, not knowing what\nI did. And he answered. That's what happened. As if--as if a bandage\nhad been lifted from my eyes, I was--I was in the presence of\nthings--indescribable. There was no change, only that where I was blind\nbefore I now saw. I don't mean vision. I haven't words to explain what\nI mean. But a world was about me as real as this; it had perhaps always\nbeen there; in that moment I was first aware of it. I knew, as if a door\nhad been opened, what heaven means--a condition of being. And I knew\nanother thing more personal--that, without question, it was right with\nthose I thought I had lost and that the horror which seemed blackest\nI have no need to dread. I cannot say that I saw them or heard or\ntouched them, but I was with them. I understand, but I can't make you\nunderstand. I told Dick an hour ago that if I could believe they were\nliving, that I should ever have them again, I should be perfectly happy.\nThat's true now. I believe it, and I am--perfectly happy.\"\n\nThe listener groaned uncontrollably.\n\n\"I know your thought,\" the judge answered the sound, and his eyes were\nlike lamps as he turned them toward the man. \"But you're wrong--my mind\nis not unhinged. You'll see. After what I've gone through, after facing\neternity without hope, what are mere years? I can wait. I know. I\nam--perfectly happy.\"\n\nThen the man who listened rose from his chair and came and put a hand\ngently on the shoulder of the judge, looking down at him gravely. \"I\ndon't understand you very well, John,\" he said, \"but I'm glad of\nanything--of anything\"--his voice went suddenly. \"Will you wait for me\nhere a few minutes? I'm going home and I'll be back. I think I'll spend\nthe night with you if you don't object.\"\n\n\"Object! Wait!\" The judge looked up in surprise, and with that he\nsmiled. \"I see. Surely. I'd like to have you here. Yes, I'll certainly\nwait.\"\n\nOutside in the hall one might have heard the brother-in-law say a low\nword or two to Miller as the man helped him on with his coat; then the\nfront door shut softly, and he was gone, and the judge sat alone, his\nhead thrown back against his chair, his face luminous.\n\nThe other man swung down the dark street, rushing, agitated. As he came\nto the corner an electric light shone full on him and a figure crossing\ndown toward him halted.\n\n\"Father! I was coming to find you. Something extraordinary has happened.\nI was coming to find you.\"\n\n\"Yes, Dick.\" The older man waited.\n\n\"I've just left Charley Owen at the house--you remember Charley Owen?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you do--he's been here with--Jack. He was in Jack's class in\ncollege--in Jack's and Ben Armstrong's. He used to go on shooting trips\nwith them both--often.\"\n\n\"I remember now.\"\n\n\"Yes, I knew you would.\" The young voice rushed on. \"He has been away\njust now--down in Florida shooting--away from civilization. He got all\nhis mail for a month in one lump--just now--two days ago. In it was a\nletter from Jack and Ben Armstrong, written that night, written\ntogether. Do you see what that means?\"\n\n\"What!\" The word was not\na question, but an exclamation.\n\"What--Dick!\"\n\n\"Yes--yes. There were newspapers, too, which gave an account of the\ntrial--the first he'd heard of it--he was away in the Everglades. He\nstarted instantly, and came on here when he had read the papers, and\nrealized the bearing his letter would have on the trial. He has\ntravelled day and night. He hoped to get here in time. Jack and Ben\nthought he was in New York. They wrote to ask him to go\nduck-shooting--with them. And, father--here's the most startling point\nof it all.\" As the man waited, watching his son's face, he groaned\nsuddenly and made a gesture of despair.\n\n\"Don't, father--don't take it that way. It's good--it's glorious--it\nclears Jack. My uncle will be almost happy. But I wouldn't tell him at\nonce--I'd be careful,\" he warned the other.\n\n\"What was it--the startling point you spoke of?\"\n\n\"Oh--surely--this. The letter to Charley Owen spoke of Jack's new\npistol--that pistol. Jack said they would have target-shooting with it\nin camp. They were all crack shots, you know. He said he had bought it\nthat evening, and that Ben thought well of it. Ben signed the letter\nafter Jack, and then added a postscript. It clears Jack--it clears him.\nDoesn't it, father? But I wouldn't tell my uncle just yet. He's not fit\nto take it in for a few hours--don't you think so?\"\n\n\"No, I won't tell him--just yet.\"\n\nThe young man's wide glance concentrated with a flash on his father's\nface. \"What is it? You speak queerly. You've just come from there.\nHow is he--how is my uncle?\"\n\nThere was a letterbox at the corner, a foot from the older man's\nshoulder. He put out his hand and held to the lid a moment before he\nanswered. His voice was harsh.\n\n\"Your uncle is--perfectly happy,\" he said. \"He's gone mad.\"",
