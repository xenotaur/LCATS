    "body": "There is no one today who has seen a living horse. The creature became\nextinct a couple of centuries ago, about the year 2,800. Man, who\nbetrayed the horse into what he became, hardly regretted the passing.\n\nHowever, and I speak with all sincerity, there will be men of the\nfuture who will see a horse. Perhaps men of the future may ride\nhorseback like knights and cowboys of the Middle Ages.\n\nThe secret of time travel has been discovered. No one has traveled\nthrough time as yet, although man has explored the universe for more\nthan twenty light years from the sun. But the day of time travel is not\nfar distant. It had simple beginnings. All great things began in simple\nways. Newton and the apple were the beginnings of modern understanding\nof the laws of the physical world; Watts and the teakettle were the\norigins of industry and the machine age. A very beautiful young woman\nand an unscrupulous man were responsible for time travel.\n\nI met the man early in the morning of July 2, 3002. I remember the\ndate because on the day before I had visited in Alexandria, Egypt, and\nI had eaten dinner in Shanghai, China. It was nearly midnight when I\nreached the rocket port in Chicago and a jam in the pneumatics delayed\nmy arrival home until nearly one o'clock in the morning.\n\nBlake, fully dressed, met me at the door. There was a worried look in\nhis eyes.\n\n\"There is a gentleman to see you, sir,\" Blake said. \"I explained that\nyou would not return until quite late and I tried to get him to leave,\nbut he said it was urgent that he see you the minute you returned.\"\nBlake glanced over his shoulder toward the library and lowered his\nvoice to a whisper. \"I was a little frightened of him, sir. He doesn't\nseem quite--ah--quite right, sir, if you know what I mean. Shall I call\nthe police?\"\n\n\"No, Blake.\" I felt confident of licking my weight in madmen and I\nentered the library.\n\nA tall, distinguished, dark haired gentleman rose to greet me.\n\n\"Ah! Dr. Huckins! I was afraid you would not get here in time!\"\n\nAs he spoke I noticed a peculiar light in his eyes. It seemed to be a\nreflection from the fluorescent lamps of the library, but it showed a\nlittle too much of the whites of his eyes and I thought of what Blake\nhad said about the man not being \"quite right.\"\n\nI did not feel that I owed him an apology for keeping him waiting,\nsince I usually received visitors by appointment.\n\n\"I am Gustav Keeshwar!\" he introduced himself. He seemed to expect some\nreaction, but unfortunately the name meant nothing to me, although if\nI had paid more attention to the newspapers I would have known who he\nwas at once.\n\n\"I am the president of the Stellar Transport Company,\" he announced.\n\nAs he spoke he glanced secretively about the room, as though he feared\nan eavesdropper. Then he picked up a brief case which was lying on the\ntable. With no explanation he opened it and pulled out package after\npackage of thousand dollar bills.\n\n\"You may count it if you wish,\" Keeshwar said. \"There are 1,000 bills,\neach of one thousand dollar denomination. One million dollars in cold\ncash.\"\n\nThere are any number of bank presidents who have never seen a million\ndollars in one pile. Spread out before me, I could scarcely grasp the\namount of wealth it represented. As I recall now, my clearest mental\nreaction was a curiosity about how he managed to tuck it away so neatly\nin a brief case. Then I wondered if it was real money. A closer glance\nat the bills convinced me that it was.\n\nSuddenly I came to my senses. I closed the library door and locked it.\nI glanced nervously at the shades to make sure all were pulled down.\n\n\"Great Scott, man, you shouldn't carry all that money around with you\nin a brief case!\" As I said it, I spoke with the realization that the\nman was mad.\n\n\"I brought the money to you,\" Keeshwar said. \"It is yours if you will\ndo one thing for me.\"\n\n\"I must ask you to leave and to take your money with you,\" I said,\nrealizing that I was turning down the ransom of a king. \"No honest task\never called for a million dollars compensation--\"\n\n\"But you have not asked me what I wish you to do!\" Keeshwar exploded.\n\"Look! Do you see how much money a million dollars is?\"\n\nI do not wish to pose as a man over-stocked with principles. A million\ndollars is more money than I ever hope to see again at one time.\nBut I had a good income, a nice little fortune tucked away in worth\nwhile investments. I had a good name and my position in the world was\nbetter than average. I did not trust this man. I had a feeling that the\nmillion dollars he offered would not be worth the price.\n\n\"I am a surgeon,\" I said. \"If you wish my professional services, I will\ncharge you a reasonable fee.\"\n\n\"I want your services,\" Keeshwar said. \"I want them for one day.\"\n\n\"You may have them. I will send you a bill after I complete the task.\"\n\n\"I want your services tomorrow,\" said Keeshwar, persistently.\n\nI shook my head. \"I have a delicate operation scheduled tomorrow. It is\nan operation I cannot postpone.\"\n\n\"It is an operation on Trella Mayo?\"\n\nI started. \"How did you know that?\"\n\n\"It is this operation that I wish you to perform for me,\" Keeshwar\nsaid. \"Would it not be simple to let your knife slip, or to allow\nsomething to happen to her--for one million dollars!\"\n\nI do not remember clearly what happened next. I think I knocked the man\ndown. I do remember stuffing his million dollars into his brief case\nand throwing it after him out of the door.\n\nWhen I closed the door I was excited and unnerved. I found some\nsedative tablets and swallowed one. Then I sat down to think. Trella\nMayo, beautiful, young and intelligent, a woman in a billion! Someone\nwanted to kill her.\n\nShe was only twenty-eight, yet her discoveries in physics had astounded\nthe world. She might have taken first place in any beauty contest, yet\nshe preferred working in a laboratory with men too old to notice her\ncharms.\n\nHer operation was not serious, except that it involved delicate skill.\nI resolved that nothing must happen during that operation the following\nday.\n\nTwo weeks later I visited Trella, now convalescing from her operation.\n\n\"I've wanted to talk to you, Fred,\" she said after I had taken her\ntemperature, felt her pulse and gone through the usual ritual.\n\n\"I must warn you that I'll send you a bill for any medical advice I\ngive you,\" I replied, laughing.\n\nShe smiled only a little and then puckered her brow seriously.\n\n\"I wanted to ask you about that operation. Wasn't it performed under\nunusual circumstances?\"\n\nI was taken by surprise and I am afraid that the truth forced its\nindications through my professional manner. \"Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"I noticed Blake standing near the door. There seemed to be a bulge\nin his pocket. It couldn't have been a gun, could it? And you kept\nwatching, as if you were afraid a tribe of Indians would drop in for a\nmassacre. I wonder if there couldn't have been a tall, dark gentleman\nmixed up in these unusual precautions?\"\n\nI did not reply.\n\n\"And I've noticed during my convalescence that the internes that\ncontinually hover around my door have a look as if--well, shall I say\nthat they look more like policemen than internes?\"\n\nI laughed nervously. \"I think you are a mental case, Miss Mayo,\" I\nsaid. \"I shall have to call in a specialist.\"\n\n\"You do not need to deny it, Fred,\" she said. \"Why do you suppose I\ninsisted that you perform the operation? Why didn't I let you call in\nsomeone else? It was because you are the only man in the world that I\ntrust, Fred. How much did Gustav Keeshwar offer you to do me in?\"\n\nBefore I could stop myself I opened my mouth and blurted the truth.\n\n\"One million dollars!\"\n\n\"Whew!\" Trella whistled softly. \"I'm worth a lot to you! I must be\ngetting close if Keeshwar will pay a million to see me out of the way.\"\n\n\"Trella,\" I pleaded. \"What is it all about? What's behind this\nmystery?\"\n\n\"If you turned down a million dollars for my sake, I think I can trust\nyou,\" she said. \"Supposing I was about to invent a new method of\nlocomotion? Can you see where Keeshwar might find me obnoxious?\"\n\n\"A new kind of space ship?\"\n\nTrella shook her head. \"A new kind of locomotion. Animals either swim\nor walk. Man also uses wheels.\"\n\n\"He also can fly. So can birds.\"\n\n\"Flying is simply swimming through the air and crawling, as a worm\nor snake, is gliding, like swimming. Space ships swim, too, after a\nfashion. Boats swim through the sea and sleds swim on ice. Therefore we\nhave only three kinds of locomotion: Legs, wheels and sleds. Another\nmight revolutionize everything.\"\n\n\"But there couldn't be any other way to travel. Even the planets 'sled'\nthrough ether.\"\n\n\"There is another way. It will open exploration to the furthest limits\nof the galaxy.\"\n\n\"I can see why Keeshwar was so interested.\"\n\n\"As soon as I'm out of bed, I want you to call on me at my laboratory,\nFred. I'll show you something that will make your eyes pop out of your\nhead.\"\n\nI turned to leave, when something on the window pane caught my eye.\nIt was a small, cherry-red spot, about the size of a twenty-five cent\npiece.\n\nThe minute I saw it, I knew what it was. I shouted to the\ninterne--really a detective--outside the door, and lifted Trella into\nmy arms. I must admit that I handled her a little roughly and she\ngroaned as I hurried her out of the room. But what I did was necessary.\n\nAs I left the room, the glass of the pane melted and a beam flashed\nacross the room, striking the bed where Trella had been an instant\nbefore. That beam was an Oronic Ray, 5,000 degrees hot, of the type\nused in welding the rockets of space ships.\n\nIt was evident that Gustav Keeshwar intended to finish Trella Mayo\nwhether I would help him or not.\n\n\n\nA few weeks later I visited Trella in her laboratory.\n\n\"I'm anxious to see this incomprehensible conveyance,\" I explained.\n\n\"At least, I'm glad you are taking an interest in something besides my\nsafety and my operation scar,\" she replied.\n\nShe led me through a corridor toward a heavy steel door, which she\nunlocked.\n\n\"You are the first person besides myself to go into this room in the\npast five years,\" Trella added.\n\nI scarcely know what I had expected to see. What would anyone expect\nto see, if he was told he was going to be shown a machine that\nneither walked, glided nor rolled? Such a contraption is beyond human\nexperience.\n\nIt was a long, hollow tube, large enough to hold a human body. It was\nmade of quartz and on each side was a cylindrical, low power atomic\nenergy machine.\n\n\"This,\" Trella said, \"is the translator.\"\n\n\"The what?\"\n\n\"I call it my space-time translator, which someday will make the rocket\nas obsolete for space travel as the horse for surface travel. It will\ntake an object from one point in space-time to another instantly.\"\n\n\"Instantly?\"\n\n\"There is a small lapse of time,\" Trella confessed. \"You see the\nmachine has two motors, one for starting the operation and the other\nfor completing it. It takes about one second's time to switch the\nmotive power from one motor to the other.\"\n\nThe machine, except for the motors, was made entirely of quartz and\nsilver. On the right side of the machine was a long strip of silver\nrunning the full length of the tube. It was about three inches wide and\nit was connected with a knife-like blade of silver on the left side\nof the tube by a strand of silver wire. Silver was used, of course,\nbecause it was the best known conductor of electricity and other forms\nof energy.\n\n\"It would be wonderful if it worked,\" I said.\n\n\"It does work,\" Trella said. \"We sent two guinea pigs to the Sirius\nsystem yesterday morning. We got them back in an hour with a copy of\nyesterday's issue of _The Sirian Daily Universe_. Here's the paper.\"\n\nShe held out a copy of the beautifully printed daily magazine. On the\ncover was the date, August V2, 504 (3002).\n\nIt was customary for terrestrials to use terrestrial dates wherever\ntheir outposts were located in the stellar system. But instead of using\nthe terrestrial year--as shown in parenthesis on _The Sirian Daily\nUniverse_--the year always was reckoned from the date when the planet\nwas first visited by an expedition from the solar system. Although days\nwere not always the same, twenty-four hour periods could be reckoned\nquite easily so that on some planets a single day might have more than\none terrestrial date, and on others a single day would be a fraction of\na legal day. The number of actual days usually was indicated by a Roman\nnumeral preceding the Arabic figure. Thus August V2 indicated that\nSirius had risen and set five times while the sun had done so twice\nduring the month of August.\n\n\"Unbelievable!\" I said. \"How does it work?\"\n\n\"It operates through time,\" Trella explained. \"It takes a short cut\nbetween two parallel instants.\"\n\nShe took a guinea pig from a cage in the laboratory. She put the\nwriggling animal inside the quartz tube and strapped it firmly in the\ncenter.\n\n\"Watch,\" she said.\n\nShe turned a switch on one of the boxes. A low hum arose from the\natomic motor. Trella watched a dial located in the top of the quartz\ntube until an arrow pointed to a gold star. Then she pressed a button\nin the motor on the right side of the machine.\n\nI noticed that the translator had controls that could be operated from\ninside the tube as well as from the outside.\n\nThere were two distinct gasps of the motor. Half of the guinea pig\ndisappeared with the first gasp and the remaining half disappeared with\nthe second.\n\nWhere the tube had been a second before, there was nothing now.\n\n\"He's on Proxima Centaur now,\" Trella said. \"I managed to equip a\nlaboratory there about two years ago. It was through that laboratory\nthat Keeshwar learned of my experiments in translation. My men on\nProxima will send back the guinea pig in a few minutes.\"\n\nWe sat down and waited. Trella explained the machine, although at the\ntime the explanation was a little over my head. The actual translation\nwas accomplished by the pushing of one motor and the pulling of another\nacross an extra-dimensional space. Half of the object to be translated\nwas hurled across space by the pushing of the first motor. The second\nmotor, which operated automatically, began pulling the other half,\nincluding the first motor, after it as soon as it materialized at the\nend of the journey.\n\nBy means of radio signals the exact location of every explored planet\nhad been determined. It was therefore only a matter of mathematical\ncalculation to find the target. There was some risk, of course, if a\nmathematical error were made in computing the range but considering the\nrisks involved in ordinary methods of interstellar flight everything\nwas in favor of the translator.\n\n\"The whole secret of the invention lies in locating the proper _Now_ in\nspace-time,\" Trella explained.\n\n\"The proper _Now_?\" I asked.\n\n\"Of course,\" she said, \"the _Now_ we experience on earth is not the\nsame _Now_ that exists simultaneously on Rihlon, the second planet\nof Proxima Centaur. We are dealing with space-time, Fred. Time is a\ndimension, it stretches like a line through space. If we connect the\n_Now_ of the present with the _Now_ of ten minutes ago, we have a\nstraight line, just as we would have a straight line if we connected\nany two points in the universe. The _Now_ of the present and the _Now_\nten minutes ago on Rihlon also would be a straight line, but it would\nnot be the same straight line.\"\n\n\"But it would be parallel!\" I exclaimed, beginning to see her point.\n\n\"Oh, so you _do_ know something about mathematics?\"\n\n\"Of course! If you connect the _Nows_ of the present on both the earth\nand Rihlon, you have a straight line, perpendicular to the parallel\ntime lines of both the earth and Rihlon. Why couldn't your invention be\nused for time travel? Couldn't you connect the present--_Now_ of Rihlon\nwith any _Now_ in the time line of the earth--any _Now_ of the past or\nfuture?\"\n\n\"The idea occurred to me, but it won't work,\" Trella replied. \"There's\na serious obstacle we can't overcome. In going backward or forward in\ntime we do not travel in lines perpendicular to the parallel time lines\nof the earth and Rihlon--or for any other planet for that matter. But\nwe travel like this--\" Trella drew a figure on a piece of paper.\n\n    A      G    E    B\n    -------+----+------\n            \\   |\n             \\  |\n              \\ |\n    C          \\|F   D\n    ------------+-----\n\nFigure 1]\n\n\"The line AB represents the time line of the earth and the line CD\nrepresents the time line of any other planet X. The two lines are\nparallel. E represents the earth--_Now_, and F the _Now_ on planet X. A\nline connecting the two is perpendicular to both AB and CD. Supposing\nwe should travel from F to a point G, a _Now_ in the earth's past. If\nwe connect F and G we would have a right triangle GEF. The hypothenuse\nGF would be the square root of GE squared plus EF squared.\"\n\n\"There is nothing mathematically implausible in that,\" I said.\n\n\"There is nothing implausible, yet to determine the exact distance from\nG to F is in most cases impossible. Unless the distances involved are\nof the proper ratio, say, 4 and 5, the line GF becomes an irrational\nnumber, of which it is impossible to find the exact value. Supposing\nthe distance from E to F was one light-year and the distance from G\nto E, one year. Then GF would be the square root of one squared plus\none squared, or the square root of two. Because we are dealing with\nsuch immense distances and because even the smallest decimal point of\nerror might lead to disastrous results, we cannot attempt time travel\nunless we know the exact value of the square root of two, or any other\nirrational number.\"\n\nAs Trella finished speaking there was a coughing hum and the translator\nappeared in the room, containing the unharmed guinea pig and a copy of\nthe _Rihlon Gazette_ for Aug. 3rd, which was this day.\n\n\"Do you believe me?\" she cried gleefully, waving the paper over her\nhead.\n\nIt was quite convincing, I admitted.\n\n\"Now I am going to make a trip in the translator!\"\n\n\"You!\"\n\nIt was the beginning of a long argument. There was danger in the trip,\nI told her, and Trella had come to mean a great deal to me. She scoffed\nat my fears and told me that if I didn't care to witness the first\ntranslation of man to another planet in another star system she would\ndo it when I wasn't there.\n\nOf course, no man can win an argument with a woman.\n\nTrella climbed into the translator.\n\nI closed the opening. Her hand rose to the switch that operated the\nmechanism from inside the tube. She smiled and her lips moved in a\ncheerful good-by. Then she touched the switch.\n\nThe indicator on the dial crept upward toward the gold star.\n\nSuddenly the unexpected occurred.\n\nThe door of the laboratory opened. Trella had forgotten to lock the\ndoor when we entered the room.\n\nAs I heard the noise, I turned and saw Gustav Keeshwar leveling a gun\ntoward the helpless young woman in the glass tube.\n\nI sprang toward him just as the gun went off.\n\nApparently he had not expected to find me in the room, for as I lunged\nhe uttered a cry and threw the gun at my face. Then he turned and ran.\n\nI managed to duck in time to receive only a glancing blow on the head.\nI started to pursue, when my eyes fell on the translator.\n\nSomething terrible was wrong.\n\nHalf of the tube had disappeared and, with it, half of Trella's body.\nThe other half, containing half of the most beautiful woman on the\nearth, remained in the laboratory.\n\nMy spring toward Keeshwar had spoiled his aim enough to keep the bullet\nfrom striking Trella, but the bullet had struck the small silver wire\nthat ran from the atomic motor on one side to the atomic motor on the\nother. The translation had been only half completed.\n\nHalf of Trella's body was on the earth, while the other was on Rihlon,\nfour light years away!\n\nHer single eye was open and her half-face was frozen in an expression\nof terror. She did not move and she was not breathing. There was no\nblood. It was a complete suspension of animation.\n\nSuddenly I realized that I was losing precious seconds. Unless\nsomething was done, Trella would die.\n\nI picked up the bit of wire that had been broken off by Keeshwar's\nbullet. I lifted it toward the end dangling from the motor.\n\nThen Trella moved! It was not suspended animation, but something\nelse--something new!\n\nHer eye swung toward me. Her half-head visibly shook. Her half-lips\nmoved but no sound of her voice reached me. But I understood. She was\ntelling me not to replace the wire.\n\nShe lifted her hand and drew a right-angled triangle on the side of the\ntube.\n\nI understood. Trella was alive and she would continue to live, but it\nwould be impossible to restore her component halves merely by mending\nthe broken wire.\n\nTrella was linked in time. She was still whole, but half of her body\nwas visible in one _Now_ and the other half in a _Now_ on Proxima\nCentaur, four light years away.\n\nTo join the halves of her body, would mean joining the two _Nows_ and\nto do that would form a triangle, at least one side of which would be\nan irrational number. Unless the riddle of time travel were solved, it\nwould be impossible to make Trella whole.\n\nI walked around the half-tube. Her appearance was not what I expected\nto see. It was not a case of sawing a woman in half. The cross section\nof her body appeared only as an opaque blankness. When I touched\nher side I felt something cold and hard. It was as if I had touched\neternity.\n\nThe laboratory officials were called in for consultation. It was\ndecided that the matter should be hushed, at least until we knew what\nshould be done. There was too much to do now to be bothered with police\nand reporters. We would not have a warrant issued for Keeshwar. There\nwould be time to deal with him later.\n\nWe discovered that Trella could eat and she seemed to be in perfect\nhealth. But I knew that she was doomed unless we could restore the\nparts of her body. Her muscles would atrophy. Inaction is more deadly\nto the human machine than millions of disease germs.\n\nIf it would be possible to locate some day in the future when the wires\nmight be pieced together and the linking of Trella's two halves might\nbe accomplished without rationalizing irrational numbers, our problem\nwould be solved. But the nearest date in the future when this could be\ndone was three years ahead.[1]\n\n[Footnote 1: Three years from the time this accident occurred would\nmake the sides of the triangle between the past event, the present, and\nthe present on Rihlon (four light years away) equal to the units 3, 4\nand 5. Three squared, plus four squared equals five squared.]\n\nBut in three years Trella would be dead. We could not wait for the\ncoordinates to adjust themselves. We had to make the coordinates\nadjustable to our purposes.\n\nA small chronometer located in the atomic energy machine on the quartz\ntube gave us the exact time the silver wire had been broken.\n\nEven Blake, my servant, offered a suggestion:\n\n\"If you could take the earth half of Miss Trella's body to Rihlon, or\nbring the Rihlon half to earth and bring the two _Nows_ together, would\nthat form a rational triangle?\"\n\nI took paper and pencil and tried to figure it out.\n\n    B      E               H         A\n    -------+---------------+----------\n           |              /|\n           |             / |\n           |            /  |\n           |           /   |\n           |          /    |\n    -------+---------+-----+----------\n    C      F         G     J         D\n\nFigure 2]\n\nThe line BA represented the time line of Rihlon. The line CD was the\ntime line of the earth. The points E and F were the _Nows_ on Rihlon\nand earth, respectively, at which the accident occurred. The point G\nrepresented the _Now_ at which a space ship would leave the earth for\nRihlon carrying Trella's half body. The point H represented the _Now_\nof arrival on Rihlon and the point J the parallel point on earth.\nWe still had a right-angled triangle and we still had to deal with\nirrational numbers. But hold on--\n\nI gazed at my drawing. Before my eyes was the answer! The whole thing\nwas clearly and completely solved. The secret of time travel was\nsolved. Trella was saved. The invention of the translator had been\nperfected so that all danger of becoming lost in time was removed![2]\n\n[Footnote 2: As a mental exercise, I would suggest that the reader look\nat Figure 2 for a minute or two and figure out the answer. The answer\nis there and high school mathematics should enable a person to discover\nhow to extract the irrational number.--Dr. Fred Huckins.]\n\n\"Blake,\" I said to the servant, \"bring me my automatic pistol.\"\n\n\"Wh-what?\" Blake stuttered.\n\n\"I said bring me my automatic pistol. I'm going to save Trella, or\nmurder somebody.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I should call your lawyer.\"\n\nI threw a book at him and he left hurriedly, to return in a few minutes\nwith my pistol and holster. I strapped the weapon about my waist and\nslammed my straw hat on my head. In a few minutes I stepped from a taxi\nin front of the Galaxy building, in which the officers of the Stellar\nTransport Company are located.\n\nA clerk with thick glasses interviewed me.\n\n\"I want to charter a ship for a trip to Proxima Centaur,\" I explained.\n\"I want one of your late model cruisers which can go about ten times\nthe speed of light. I want to get there quickly.\"\n\nThe clerk nodded. I have often wondered about the composure of clerks\nwho never seem to be astonished at anything. \"We have a ship available\nthat could get you there in three months, that's sixteen times the\nspeed of light. But to charter it would cost one million dollars.\"\n\nHe never batted an eye when he named the price. I doubt if the clerk\nwas receiving more than forty a week.\n\n\"I should like to transact the deal directly with Mr. Keeshwar,\" I said.\n\n\"He will be pleased, I'm sure,\" the clerk replied. \"What is your name?\"\n\n\"Andrew J. Colt,\" I said, for lack of more originality.\n\nThe clerk disappeared into the sanctum. He returned presently with:\n\n\"Mr. Keeshwar will see you, Mr. Colt.\"\n\nI had counted on Keeshwar being--or pretending to be very busy as I\nentered. I expected him to pay no attention to my entry, and not even\nto glance in my direction, as if a million dollars were a trifling\nmatter, until we were alone.\n\nI judged Keeshwar right. When at last he glanced at me he was unnerved\nby the presence of an automatic pistol which was pointed directly at\nhis head.\n\n\"I must warn you not to touch any of those buttons on your desk,\" I\nsaid. \"It would give me a great deal of pleasure to drill you and I\nwon't go out of my way for an opportunity.\"\n\n\"Wh-what d-d-do you w-w-ant?\" he asked, turning pale.\n\n\"One day you offered me a million dollars to take Miss Mayo's life,\"\nI said. \"Now I'm asking you to contribute an equal amount to save it.\nHowever, I'm willing to take it out in trade. I want you to pilot one\nof your ships for me to Rihlon.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" Keeshwar said, regaining some of his composure. \"I\ncouldn't leave my business for a period long enough to make the trip.\"\n\n\"If you don't leave your business to make the trip right now you won't\nexist any more,\" I warned casually. I reached into my pocket and\nbrought out a silencer, which I fitted to the end of the pistol barrel.\nI unfastened the safety and aimed deliberately.\n\n\n\nThe space ship containing the terrestrial half of Trella Mayo, in\ncompany with myself, Blake, two other scientists and Gustav Keeshwar,\narrived on Rihlon three months later. Keeshwar, who had had a pistol\ntrained on him almost every instant since I had called at his office,\nwas released and permitted to return to earth. He did not know that I\nhad left the instructions on earth for his arrest for felonious assault\nthe minute he landed.\n\nWe located Trella's Rihlon laboratory. It was the matter of a few\nminutes to make the connection of the broken wire and to finish the\ntranslation of her two halves.\n\nTrella stepped out of her quartz prison, swayed unsteadily for a second\non her feet, and then collapsed.\n\n\"How on earth did you do it?\" she asked. \"How did you reconcile the\nirrational number?\"\n\nI sketched the figure roughly (Figure 2). \"The distance from F to G and\nthe distance from E to H does not enter into the equation,\" I said.\n\"The only thing we are interested in is the distances GJ, JH and GH.\"\n\n\"And GH is an irrational number,\" Trella said.\n\n\"Quite right, although like most things that appear absurd on the\nsurface, it is not as irrational as it seems. The distance G to J\nis three months, the time required for the flight from the earth to\nRihlon. We will represent this by the unit 1. The distance JH is\nfour light years, the distance in space from earth to Rihlon. This,\ntherefore, would be sixteen units. Using the formula (GJ)^2 plus (JH)^2\nequals (GH)^2 we find that GH is the square root of one plus 256, or\n257. The square root of 257 is 16.031228, etc., an irrational number.\n\n\"It can't be expressed in figures! We do not need figures when we can\ndraw a picture. The triangle GHJ is a picture of an irrational number.\nWe had only to go to Rihlon to complete the equation.\"\n\n\"Time can be traveled,\" Trella said.\n\n\"Where would you like to go on our honeymoon?\" I asked.\n\n\"To the Garden of Eden,\" she said.",
