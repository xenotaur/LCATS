Casement at back C. opening\non the street; door, L. 3. E.; rough bedstead R. of window; rude chairs\nand table, with candle, manuscripts, and writing materials on it, L. C.;\nold washstand, on which are a glass, a basin, and a broken jug of water,\nR. 2. E.  The Garret is in the house of Mrs. Angell, and is the lodging\nof the Poet Chatterton.  It is the night of August 24th, 1770.  Music\non rise of curtain.  A distant bell is heard tolling the hour.\n\nMrs. Angell.  [Knocking from without.]  Mr. Chatterton!  [Knocking.]\nMr. Chatterton!  [Knocking.]  Mr. Chatterton!\n\nEnter Mrs. Angell with lamp.  Lights up.\n\nMr. Chatterton, a gentleman--[Looking around.]  Alack! the boy is out.\n[Places lamp on table, and goes back to door.]  Come in, sir.\n\nEnter Burgum and Bertha.\n\nMr. Chatterton is not in.  Will you wait, Mr.--, Mr.--\n\nBurgum.  [Pompously.]  Mr. de Burgum, Madam.  I trust that I shall have\na more honorable title soon;--eh, daughter?\n\nBertha.  There is no more honorable title, father.\n\nBurgum.  Bah! romantic.\n\nMrs. Angell.  He surely will return soon: he is seldom out in the\nevening.\n\nBurgum.  I'll await his coming.  I must see him on a matter connected\nwith the de Burgum Pedigree, which he was fortunate enough to discover.\nI say \"fortunate enough,\" since otherwise some one else would have\ndiscovered it--birth, like murder, will out.\n\nMrs. Angell.  Pray be seated, sir.  [Burgum sits R. of table; Bertha,\nL.]\n\nBurgum.  [Looking around the room.]  The rewards of poetry, my dear.\n\nBertha.  The rewards of poetry, father, only poets know.\n\nBurgum.  Another romantic speech!  If you must worship a poet, worship\nmy collateral ancestor, Master John de Bergham, a Cistercian monk, one\nof the greatest ornaments of his age--so the Pedigree reads--and a\ntranslator of the Iliad.  This boy never can be a poet: he knows no\nLatin and Greek.\n\nBertha.  He is not writing Latin and Greek.\n\nBurgum.  I regret that I permitted you to come.  You are a sentimental\ngirl likely to fall in love with such a vagabond as Chatterton.\n\nBertha.  Do not call him a vagabond, father: you owe so much to him.\n\nBurgum.  For what?\n\nBertha.  Your Pedigree.\n\nBurgum.  He has been paid.\n\nBertha.  Yes--a crown.\n\nBurgum.  Hem!  He shall have more after the College of Heralds has\npassed upon my claims--not before.\n\nBertha.  In the meantime he may starve.\n\nMrs. Angell.  Indeed, lady, he is starving now.\n\nBurgum.  Nonsense!  One-half the troubles in life are due to gorging.\nBesides, I heard before we left Bristol that he had sent his mother some\nchina and dress patterns--even British herb-tobacco and a pipe for his\ngrandmother.  Starving?--nonsense!\n\nMrs. Angell.  That was over a month ago, sir.  Then he always was\ntelling of what he was going to do for his mother; but now he seems so\nhopeless, and still he writes so hopefully to her.  I do not believe he\nhas had a morsel of food these two days.  He is too proud to take\nanything from me.  He says he is not hungry, and yet he looks almost\nfamished.\n\nBertha.  Poor Chatterton!\n\nBurgum.  Why does he not work?\n\nMrs. Angell.  He does work, sir--all night sometimes--writing, writing,\nwriting.\n\nBurgum.  I mean at something profitable--looking up pedigrees, for\ninstance,--the boy has a genius for pedigrees.\n\nMrs. Angell.  I believe he is trying to get an appointment as a\nsurgeon's mate.  My husband, good man, offered to secure him a place as\na compter; but Mr. Chatterton stormed about the house.\n\nBurgum.  A poet's gratitude.\n\nBertha.  A poet's indignation 'gainst a clown.\n\nMrs. Angell.  My husband is no clown, lady.\n\nBertha.  I beg your pardon, Madam.\n\nBurgum.  [To Mrs. Angell.]  Pay no attention to her: she is as crazy as\nChatterton.\n\nBertha.  I would I were.\n\nBurgum.  Bah!  You are half in love with the beggar already.\n\nMrs. Angell.  If he had a chance, sir, I think he would make something\ngreat.\n\nBertha.  I am sure of it!\n\nBurgum.  You never met him.\n\nBertha.  But I have seen him, and have read his poems.\n\nBurgum.  That doggerel in the \"Town and County\"? [Taking a paper from\ntable.]  Here is more of it.  [Glances at paper.]  What's this?\n[Reads.]\n\n  \"Gods! what would Burgum give to get a name\n  And snatch his blundering dialect from shame?\"\n\nThe ingrate!\n\n  \"What would he give to hand his memory down\n  To time's remotest boundary--a crown.\n  Would you ask more, his swelling face looks blue;\n  Futurity he rates at two pounds two.\"\n\nZounds! this of a de Burgum--a descendant of Simon de Seyncte Lyze, a\ncompanion of William the Conqueror!\n\nMrs. Angell.  Be not angry with him, sir; he is not like one of us.\n\nEnter Chatterton, who pauses near doorway.\n\nBurgum.  Thank heaven for that!  I will not longer brook\nThe impudence of this ungrateful boy,\nWho mutters, rants, and doth himself opine\nOne of the brooding darlings of the world.\nBy what right is he moody and revengeful?\n\nBertha.  He is as nature made him: full of pride\nAnd fierce resentment 'gainst a callous race.\nGive him but patience to endure neglect--\nQuell his rebellious spirit, and you take\nFrom his tossed soul God's gift of poesy.\n\nChatterton.  [Coming forward.]\nLady, were I the poet of my dreams,\nInstead of Chatterton, I could not word\nMy gratitude to you.\n\nBertha.               'Tis Chatterton!\n\nChatterton.  Well, Burgum, what's the news?\n\nBurgum.  [Aside.]                            Impertinence!\n\nMrs. Angell.  [To Chatterton.]\nBe seated, sir; you must be very tired;\nYou have not been at home since ten o'clock.\nThe day--\n\nChatterton.  [Sinking upon a chair.]\n           Clouds, sunshine, rain--I'll sleep to-night.\n\nMrs. Angell.  Is there not something I can get you, sir?\n\nChatterton.  Ah, yes: go purchase me another heart;\nThe world has worn this out--'tis like my shoes.\n\nMrs. Angell.  When through with business you must dine with us:\nI have some sheep tongues I would have you try.\n\nChatterton.  What use are sheep tongues when I needs must roar?\nI'd eat a lion's litter.\n\nBertha.  [Aside.]         O, how strange!\n\nMrs. Angell.  [Aside.]  The boy talks very wildly.\n\nChatterton.  [Impatiently.]                         Madam, go!\nYou'd make a helpless invalid of me.  [Exit Mrs. Angell.]\nShe is a noble woman and a bore.\nNow, Norman blood, what's wrong in Bristol that\nBrings you to town?\n\nBurgum.              Let us be serious, sir.\n\nChatterton.  First let me borrow Lord North's goggle eyes,\nAnd have the modish stare: my fiery orb\nDisquiets men of birth.  Go on, go on.\n\nBurgum.  My pedigree--\n\nChatterton.           Should antedate the flood:\nI'll read your partner's brother's silly book\nOn the Noachian Deluge, and report\nWhat I can glean.\n\nBurgum.  [Aside.]  Did I not need his help,\nI'd cane the rogue.  [To him.]  I've brought my quarterings\nAnd pedigree that you did kindly trace\nTo be examined and attested by\nThe Herald's College.\n\nChatterton.  [Aside.]  George!\nHe'll find 'tis all a hoax!\n\nBurgum.                      They have them now.\nI must solicit you to go with me,\nAnd answer certain questions.  I'll pay you well.\n\nChatterton.  Not for the wealth of Soho Square, my lord.\nI am the Duke de Garret: they must come\nTo interview me here.\n\nBurgum.                Impossible!\n\nChatterton.  Then let them nose among their dusty tomes\nTo solve the riddles.\n\nBurgum.  [Indignantly.]  'Tis an outrage, sir!\nI am a lineal descendant from--\n\nChatterton.  [Laughing.]  I copied that, and know it all by rote.\nYour ancestor, in reign of Henry Sixth,\nObtained a royal patent to transmute\nAll the inferior metals into gold;\nAnd now, while George the Fat squats on the throne,\nYou, by that charter, deal in pewter, sir.\nFrom gold to pewter--'tis a fearful fall;\nAnd yet you glory in it.  O for shame!\n\nBurgum.  Remember that my daughter's here.\n\nChatterton.                                 Forgive me.\nIf I could aid you, I do vow I would,\nBut 'tis beyond my power.  [Aside.]  I do regret,\nFor her sweet sake, I played the prank.\n\nBurgum.                                  Well, well;\nI fear your going would not further me.\n\nChatterton.  [Aside.]  You'll learn that soon enough.\n\nBurgum.  [Taking coin from purse.]  Here is a shilling;\nYour landlady asserts you are in need.\n\nChatterton.  [In anger.]  'Tis false!--a lie.\n\nBurgum.                                       Well, Bertha, was I right?\nAnd, Chatterton, I'll give you this advice.\nYou eat too much or too irregular.\nA much disordered stomach is a rot\nFrom which young imps, bred like to maggots, rise,\nAnd pester sore the brain.  Could I destroy\nThe miseries by bad digestion blown,\nI'd be the benefactor of the age--\nYea! of all time.  The world is gone astray:\nYour melancholy bard o'erloads his paunch,\nAnd thinks it is poetic pregnancy.\n\nChatterton.  Few poets have a chance to overfeed.\n\nEnter Mrs. Angell.\n\nBertha.  O father, you are cruel.\n\nMrs. Angell.  [To Burgum.]         Pardon, sir.\nThere is a gentleman below, who says\nHe must see you at once.  Shall he come up?\n\nBurgum.  No, no: I'll go to him.\n\nMrs. Angell.                      I'll tell him so.\n[Exit Mrs. Angell.]\n\nBurgum.  He may bring news about the Pedigree.\n[To Bertha.]  Wait here; I shall return.  [Exit Burgum.]\n\nChatterton.  [Going to table.]            Fair advocate,\nFor your defence my thanks must be the fee.\nYou come from Bristol--is my mother well?\n\nBertha.  I really do not know.\n\nChatterton.                     No, no, of course:\nMy head is heavy.\n\nBertha.            O, you do need aid!\n\nChatterton.  Perhaps; yet more I need another mind\nThat turns not giddy on this whirling sphere.\nBut that is naught to any one save me--\nWho cares for Chatterton?\n\nBertha.                    There's one at least:\nOne who beheld him roam the Bristol streets\nBeset by dangers of a forward youth--\nMisunderstood, unhappy; one who knows\nAll that he must have suffered here from want,\nFrom loneliness, and hopes unrealized;\nOne who for him will offer up her prayers.\n\nChatterton.  Have mercy, lady, do not make me weep.\nYou do not know me: I am harsh indeed.\nI have a most unlucky way of raillery,\nAnd when the fit of satire is upon me,\nI spare not friend nor foe.  Your father's duped.\n\nBertha.  Why then we shall be happier; so 'tis well.\n\nChatterton.  Part of this wretchedness that seethes within\nIs due to damned, unconquerable pride,\nAnd part from hot imagination flows.--\nMy brain's afire.\n\nBertha.            I pity you the more:\nImaginary woes are real to him\nWhom they oppress, and hardest to dispel;\nAnd if you truly do deserve your fate,\nThen have you more to bear.\n\nChatterton.                  You came in time;\nTo-morrow--to-morrow might have been too late.\n\nBertha.  My father soon will come, and I would ask--\n\nChatterton.  My life, and it is yours.\n\nBertha.                                 No, not your life;\nBut that you nobly live.\n\nChatterton.               I'll try, I'll try.\n\nBertha.  Give me some token; let it be a verse\nIn your own hand.\n\nChatterton.        I have none worthy you.\n\nBertha.  Have you not one among your papers there?\nI know 'tis much to ask.\n\nChatterton.               No: it is yours.\n[Taking up a sheet of paper.]\nOn melancholy--that will scarcely do.\n\nBertha.  Read it to me, and I shall be the judge.\n\nChatterton.  [Reads.]\n\n  When silent are the chambers of the mind\n    To rippling laughter and to whispering love,\n    When Hope hath whirred away, a mourning dove,\n  And bats dart in and out, and moans the wind,\n  Then Melancholy comes, to night consigned,\n    And haunts the moonlit windows.  Perhaps above,\n    Not on this earth, can shadowy thoughts that rove\n  Like troubled ghosts a sweet oblivion find.\n\n  O like some cindered orb that shineth not,\n    Yet holdeth still its planets as a sun,\n  Is one burnt out by sorrow and o'erfraught\n    With that mute anguish of a life undone--\n  That sinking of the heart, that deadly thought\n    That all is lost and would be worthless won.\n\n[Handing paper to her.]  I would that it were better.\n\nBertha.                                                'Tis so sad.\n\nChatterton.  I wrote it on the midnight of the day\nI fell into a new-made grave.\n\nBertha.                        O, sir,\nYield not to gloom; for you are rich in mind.\nOf all the boons the Fates propitious grant\nI'd choose the golden branch of poesy.\n\nChatterton.  Each man doth pay a price for what he has.\nThe very qualities of mind and heart\nThat make a poet make a sufferer.\nThe keenness of perception, which unfolds\nA realm of beauty hid to other eyes,\nUnmasks the world: shows him indifference\nBehind the flimsy guise of courtesy,\nThe shallowness of friendship, the alloy\nOf self, debasing charity to trade.\nThe vividness of his imagination,\nWhich, in a garret, gives him trees and flowers,\nThe cool salt sea and heaven's blue expanse,\nEnlarges troubles, and creates such fears\nHe trembles at the possible in life.\nThe sensibility, which treasures up\nEach word or look of kindness as a gem,\nMakes bitterer the haughtiness of birth,\nThe vulgar swelling of a pompous purse,\nThe slur, the slight, the mockery of fools.\nBeyond he sees a spiritual sphere,\nWhere, by unselfishness, the terrible\nBecomes a valued teacher--where the power\nTo wound through self is lost; yet cannot reach it.\nHe is a medium through which all things speak:\nThe human passions wrack his nervous frame;\nEach thing in nature makes his heart its pulse.\nWho would aspire to wear the laurel crown?--\nIt is a crown of thorns!  [Sinks back upon chair.]\n\nBertha.  O you are faint from hunger!\n\nChatterton.                            'Tis not so:\nA giddiness--be not afraid--'t will pass--  [Faints.]\n\nBertha.  [Going to him and raising his head.]\nO Chatterton, look up!  He's dead!  He's dead!\nO world, behold your deed!  His eyelids move!\n\nChatterton.  [Recovering.]\n'Tis gone.  O I would die to wake like this.\n\nBertha.  I'll get a glass of water.\n[Goes to washstand and brings water back.]\n                                    Here, drink this.\n\nChatterton.  [After drinking.]\nI have these spells--they are not serious.\n\nBertha.  You are not well, you are not well.\n[An increasing noise outside is heard.]\n\nEnter Mrs. Angell in great excitement.\n\nMrs. Angell.  Fly, Chatterton, fly! fly!\n\nChatterton.                               Have you gone mad?\n\nMrs. Angell.  Fly!  Mr. Burgum swears he'll murder you--\nHe is enraged.\n\nChatterton.     I would fly only one\nWho had the power to extend my lease of life:\nI am aweary of the premises.\n\nMrs. Angell.  He's foaming at the mouth.\n\nChatterton.                               Then let him foam.\nEach petty wave upon the mighty sea\nFoams at its pleasure--why not he?  I say\nThen let him foam.\n\nEnter Burgum in a fury.\n\nBurgum.  [Waving his cane.]  I'll murder him!\n\nBertha.  [Interposing.]  You shall not harm him, father.\n\nMrs. Angell.  [To Chatterton.]                            Come away!\n\nChatterton.  Nay; he is harmless as a bottled bee:\nHe can but buzz.\n\nBertha.  [To Burgum.]  What is the matter, sir?\n\nBurgum.  That knave! that knave!--the pedigree is false!\nWhat can you say, you villain?\n\nBertha.                         He is ill.\n\nBurgum.  I care not for his illness, let him speak!--\nYou swindler, speak!\n\nBertha.               You gave him but a crown.\n\nBurgum.  Peace, peace; or I shall drive you from the room.\n[To Chatterton.]  Now answer me!\n\nChatterton.  [Rising.]            Were it not for your age\nAnd for your daughter whom I do respect,\nI'd answer not in words.\n\nBertha.                   O Chatterton!\n\nMrs. Angell.  O gentlemen, I beg you both forbear.\n\nChatterton.  [To Bertha.]\nHave no fear, lady; did he bear a knife\nTo stab me here, I would not parry it,\nIf by such action I should frighten you.\nStand not between.\n\nBurgum.             In King's Bench you shall lodge!\n\nChatterton.  Then I shall fatten at the town's expense.\nNow, look you, Burgum, I'll no more of this,\nUnless the lady bid me, so take heed.\nThis room doth show my poverty and needs,\nYet 'tis my castle, sir!\n\nBurgum.                   I am undone;\nAnd Bristol will clap hands upon her sides\nAnd roar with mirth.  Why did you dupe me so?--\n'Twas not for money, for 'twas but a crown.\n\nChatterton.  'Twas not for money, or you should have paid\nA thousand crowns.  You will remember, sir,\nThat when a pupil at the Bluecoat School,\nPoor, lonely, friendless, with a thirst for lore,\nI came to ask of you the loan of books,\nYou mocked my poverty, jeered at my verse,\nAnd sneering bade me learn the cobbler's trade.\nI knew your passion was for gold and birth;\nAnd gold you had.  In bitter sport\nI wrote your pedigree, scarce thinking it\nWould be received with credence; yet it was.\nI should have told you then, but you did swell\nAnd treat me with disdain.  I tell you now\nThat, since you are the father of this girl,\nI'd give my life to undo what is done;\nYet, were you not her father, I do swear\nI'd give my life to do it o'er again.\nI made a fool of gold, for it had made\nA fool of me so long.\n\nBurgum.                The whole is false:\nMy ancestor was not of Norman blood,\nAnd John de Bergham never lived at all.\n\nChatterton.  He habited a world within a world--\nThis globe of fancy, where strange creatures live,\nAnd all the business of existence moves\nUnrecked of, as though on some distant orb.--\nThank heaven! that, being a poet, he dwelt not here.\n\nBurgum.  [Despairingly.]  What shall I do?\n\nBertha.  [To Chatterton.]                   Can nothing be contrived\nBy which my father may derision 'scape?\n\nChatterton.  [To Burgum, after a thoughtful pause.]\nYou are not known in London; what is done\nWill ne'er to Bristol come: you can give out,\nAnent the pedigree, 'twas all your joke.\nPlay your cards slowly, and with that same tact\nWith which you bargain for your tin and lead;\nAnd, sir, the game is yours.\n\nBurgum.  [Chuckling.]         To turn the laugh\nUpon the laughers--good--that is the trick.\nCome, daughter, come.\n\nMrs. Angell.           'Tis dark: I'll go before.\n[Exit Mrs. Angell followed by Burgum.]\n\nBertha.  Good-by.\n\nChatterton.        O lady, when I said good-by\nTo my dear mother on the cloudy night\nI took the coach for London, I did feel\nAs though that word were fully charged with grief;\nBut 'twas not so.\n\nBertha.            O, sir, do not despair;\nAnd should we never meet again, believe\nMy thoughts will ever wander back to you.\n\nChatterton.  We shall not meet again.\n\nBurgum.  [Calling from without.]       Come, Bertha.\n\nBertha.  [To Burgum.]                                 Yes!\n[To Chatterton.]  Why so?\n\nChatterton.                If Barrett recommend me strong,\nI sail for Africa as surgeon's mate.\n\nBertha.  Indeed!--but then you will return.\n\nChatterton.                                  Perhaps.\n\nBertha.  I will not say good-by--good-night.\n\nChatterton.  [Kissing her hand.]              Farewell.\n\n[Chatterton sinks upon chair, his elbows resting on table, his face upon\nhis hands.  Bertha pauses at doorway, looks back pityingly, and then\ngoes out.]\n\nChatterton.  [Raising his head.]\nAlone, again alone, yet more alone\nThan e'er I was before.  [After a pause.]  The hope is vain.\nO there is consolation in the thought\nThat though a puppet in the hands of fate\nA man is born and lives--made now a king,\nAnd now, the sport for mocking enemies,\nHe has the power when evils hedge him round,\nAnd joy and love and hope have fled for aye,\nTo laugh! ring down the drop, and end the play.\n\nEnter Mrs. Angell.\n\nMrs. Angell.  Here is a letter, sir, that came to-day.\n[Hands letter to Chatterton.]\n\nChatterton.  [To himself.]\nThis is in Barrett's hand: it seals my doom.\n[Opens letter and reads to himself.]\nI cannot recommend you for the place\nOf surgeon's mate--you know too little physic.\n[Tears up letter and throws pieces on floor.]\n\nMrs. Angell.  Bad news?\n\nChatterton.              Good news--a warrant for my death.\n\nMrs. Angell.  How pale you look! but I have that will bring\nThe color to your cheek.  The lady begs\nThat you accept this as a loan.  [Gives a purse to Chatterton.]\n\nChatterton.                      She's kind.\nHeaven grant her happiness.  [Throwing up purse.]\n                             This yellow god\nDistributes favors with a curious hand.\nThe kings of his creation are so low\nOf forehead that their crowns sit on their eyebrows.\nThey have, for motley fools, wise men--so called\n(Not wise enough to live within their age),\nWho feed upon the bones their masters throw\nBeneath the table.  'Tis the voice of fate,\nExclusion's cruel law, that he who carries\nIn the clouds his head shall stumble on the earth.\nHere, take the trash--I am no pauper yet.  [Gives purse to her.]\n\nMrs. Angell.  [Aside.]  The boy is surely crazed.\n\nChatterton.                                        There, go at once.\nI cannot, with these artificial words,\nShow the brain busy, and keep out the thoughts\nThat knock to be admitted.  No more--go!\n\nMrs. Angell.  [With emotion.]  I meant not to offend.\n\nChatterton.                                            I am too rude.\nI needs must take a tenderer farewell.\n\nMrs. Angell.  Farewell?  Why how you talk!  You will not leave?\n\nChatterton.  I may, perhaps.\n\nMrs. Angell.                  Where are you going, sir?\n\nChatterton.  To sea; but vex me not at present, please;\nAnd, should my mother come to you, tell her\nHow hard I worked; but 'twas of no use--no use.\nGood-by, dear Mrs. Angell.  [Kisses her.]\n\nMrs. Angell.                I'll leave the lamp.\n\nChatterton.  No: take it--'tis too brilliant.\n[Lights candle and hands lamp to her.]\n\nMrs. Angell.                                   You will feel\nMuch better in the morning.\n\nChatterton.                  Pray I may.\n\nMrs. Angell.  [Aside.]  I'll ask my husband what is best to do.\n[Exit Mrs. Angell with lamp.  Lights lowered.]\n\nChatterton.  And should I reach ambition's goal at last--\nMy brain would not hold out.  Why, even now\nI feel rebellion 'gainst the reason strong\nAnd frenzy coming on.  No, not that fate--\nConfined within a mad-house! there to sit,\nPerchance for years--long years--with vacant stare\nAnd slabber dripping from the fallen lip;\nOr with a maniac's eye to see such things\nAs hell doth not contain; to hear loud shrieks\nAnd clanking chains--O God, not that, not that!\n[After a pause.]  I'll do it, and to-night.\n[Goes to door and locks it.  The click of the lock is heard.]\n                                             There Hope, stay out:\nCome not to me when life is past recall.\n[Comes back to table.]\nThey shall not have the poems which they spurned,\nBut Rowley shall with Chatterton expire.\n[Draws out box from under table, and takes out manuscripts.]\nO how these papers plead with me for life!\nAll my young thoughts and all my early dreams--\nI cannot do it!  O I cannot do it!\n[Weeping, he lets his head fall upon his arm.]\n[After a pause.]  Here fools may thrive; and I--why I lack bread.\n[Firmly.]  It must be thus.\n[Tears up papers, and throws pieces fluttering into the air.]\nO turn to white-winged gulls, and fly away:\nThis is no place for you.  And now the end.\n[Takes a vial from his pocket.]\nI feel much calmer.  [Looking at vial.]  It is better thus:\nA bullet tearing through my fevered brain\nSeems so abhorrent to me.  Yet 'tis sad\nTo send this ghostly messenger to bid\nMy troubled heart be still--and then these hands,\nThese faithful, willing hands that even now\nObey me to the death.\n[Coarse laughter of a man and woman far off in the street is heard.]\n                       What noise is that?\n[The ribalds come nearer and nearer, singing the following song, with\noccasional bursts of mirth.  Chatterton goes to window, throws open\ncasement.  The moonlight streams in.]\n\nVoices.  [From street.]\n\n  Say'st thou it is a lawless love\n    That lusts within mine eye?\n  Know thou there is no lawless love\n    Beneath the love-lit sky.\n\nFemale Voice.  I'm out of tune; give me another drink.\n[Laughter.]\n\nBoth Voices.  [Singing.]\n\n  Man maketh law, but Nature, love;\n    And in the court above\n  Love's cast for only fickleness--\n    But then it is not love.\n\n[Laughter and singing die away in the distance.  Chatterton comes from\nwindow, laughs wildly, and then suddenly checks his mirth.]\n\nChatterton.  O, what an unction for the closing eye,\nAnd what a chant to fill the parting ear!\n[A distant clock again strikes the hour.]\nA signal! be it so.  [Drinks poison.]  The deed is done.\nO, my poor mother!--peace, my anguished soul.\nHave mercy, heaven, when I cease to be,\nAnd this last act of wretchedness forgive.\n[A look of agony passes over his face; he staggers to the bed and sinks\nupon his knees; then he rises and speaks deliriously.]\nThe coach!--\nThe coach is coming!  I can hear its wheels!\nGood-by, my friends; and mother, have no fear:\nI shall succeed.  I'll write you all from London!\n\n[Falls in the moonlight upon the pieces of his manuscripts, and dies.\nSlow curtain.  Curtain rises.  Lights up.  It is morning.  Chatterton is\ndiscovered lying on the floor as before.  A discussion among voices is\nheard without.  Loud knocking.]\n\nMrs. Angell.  [From without.]  Mr. Chatterton!  [Knocking.]  Mr.\nChatterton!  [Knocking.]  Mr. Chatterton!\n\nCURTAIN",
