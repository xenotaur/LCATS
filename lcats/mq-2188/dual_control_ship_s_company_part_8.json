    "body": "\nDUAL CONTROL\n\n\n\"Never say 'die,' Bert,\" said Mr. Culpepper, kindly; \"I like you, and so\ndo most other people who know what's good for 'em; and if Florrie don't\nlike you she can keep single till she does.\"\n\nMr. Albert Sharp thanked him.\n\n\"Come in more oftener,\" said Mr. Culpepper.  \"If she don't know a steady\nyoung man when she sees him, it's her mistake.\"\n\n\"Nobody could be steadier than what I am,\" sighed Mr. Sharp.\n\nMr. Culpepper nodded.  \"The worst of it is, girls don't like steady young\nmen,\" he said, rumpling his thin grey hair; \"that's the silly part of\nit.\"\n\n\"But you was always steady, and Mrs. Culpepper married you,\" said the\nyoung man.\n\nMr. Culpepper nodded again.  \"She thought I was, and that came to the\nsame thing,\" he said, composedly.  \"And it ain't for me to say, but she\nhad an idea that I was very good-looking in them days.  I had chestnutty\nhair.  She burnt a piece of it only the other day she'd kept for thirty\nyears.\"\n\n\"Burnt it?  What for?\"  inquired Mr. Sharp.\n\n\"Words,\" said the other, lowering his voice.  \"When I want one thing\nnowadays she generally wants another; and the things she wants ain't the\nthings I want.\"\n\nMr. Sharp shook his head and sighed again.\n\n\"You ain't talkative enough for Florrie, you know,\" said Mr. Culpepper,\nregarding him.\n\n\"I can talk all right as a rule,\" retorted Mr. Sharp.  \"You ought to hear\nme at the debating society; but you can't talk to a girl who doesn't talk\nback.\"\n\n\"You're far too humble,\" continued the other.  \"You should cheek her a\nbit now and then.  Let 'er see you've got some spirit.  Chaff 'er.\"\n\n\"That's no good,\" said the young man, restlessly.  \"I've tried it.  Only\nthe other day I called her 'a saucy little kipper,' and the way she went\non, anybody would have thought I'd insulted her.  Can't see a joke, I\ns'pose.  Where is she now?\"\n\n\"Upstairs,\" was the reply.\n\n\"That's because I'm here,\" said Mr. Sharp.  \"If it had been Jack Butler\nshe'd have been down fast enough.\"\n\n\"It couldn't be him,\" said Mr. Culpepper, \"because I won't have 'im in\nthe house.  I've told him so; I've told her so, and I've told 'er aunt\nso.  And if she marries without my leave afore she's thirty she loses the\nseven hundred pounds 'er father left her.  You've got plenty of time--ten\nyears.\"\n\nMr. Sharp, sitting with his hands between his knees, gazed despondently\nat the floor.  \"There's a lot o' girls would jump at me,\" he remarked.\n\"I've only got to hold up my little finger and they'd jump.\"\n\n\"That's because they've got sense,\" said Mr. Culpepper.  \"They've got the\nsense to prefer steadiness and humdrumness to good looks and dash.  A\nyoung fellow like you earning thirty-two-and-six a week can do without\ngood looks, and if I've told Florrie so once I have told her fifty\ntimes.\"\n\n\"Looks are a matter of taste,\" said Mr. Sharp, morosely.  \"Some of them\ngirls I was speaking about just now--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Mr. Culpepper, hastily.  \"Now, look here; you go on a\ndifferent tack.  Take a glass of ale like a man or a couple o' glasses;\nsmoke a cigarette or a pipe.  Be like other young men.  Cut a dash, and\ndon't be a namby-pamby.  After you're married you can be as miserable as\nyou like.\"\n\nMr. Sharp, after a somewhat lengthy interval, thanked him.\n\n\"It's my birthday next Wednesday,\" continued Mr. Culpepper, regarding him\nbenevolently; \"come round about seven, and I'll ask you to stay to\nsupper.  That'll give you a chance.  Anybody's allowed to step a bit over\nthe mark on birthdays, and you might take a glass or two and make a\nspeech, and be so happy and bright that they'd 'ardly know you.  If you\nwant an excuse for calling, you could bring me a box of cigars for my\nbirthday.\"\n\n\"Or come in to wish you 'Many Happy Returns of the Day,'\" said the\nthrifty Mr. Sharp.\n\n\"And don't forget to get above yourself,\" said Mr. Culpepper, regarding\nhim sternly; \"in a gentlemanly way, of course.  Have as many glasses as\nyou like--there's no stint about me.\"\n\n\"If it ever comes off,\" said Mr. Sharp, rising--\"if I get her through\nyou, you shan't have reason to repent it.  I'll look after that.\"\n\nMr. Culpepper, whose feelings were a trifle ruffled, said that he would\n\"look after it too.\"  He had a faint idea that, even from his own point\nof view, he might have made a better selection for his niece's hand.\n\nMr. Sharp smoked his first cigarette the following morning, and,\nencouraged by the entire absence of any after-effects, purchased a pipe,\nwhich was taken up by a policeman the same evening for obstructing the\npublic footpath in company with a metal tobacco-box three parts full.\n\nIn the matter of ale he found less difficulty.  Certainly the taste was\nunpleasant, but, treated as medicine and gulped down quickly, it was\nendurable.  After a day or two he even began to be critical, and on\nMonday evening went so far as to complain of its flatness to the wide-\neyed landlord of the \"Royal George.\"\n\n\"Too much cellar-work,\" he said, as he finished his glass and made for\nthe door.\n\n\"Too much!  'Ere, come 'ere,\" said the landlord, thickly.  \"I want to\nspeak to you.\"\n\nThe expert shook his head, and, passing out into, the street, changed\ncolour as he saw Miss Garland approaching.  In a blundering fashion he\nclutched at his hat and stammered out a \"Good evening.\"\n\nMiss Garland returned the greeting and, instead of passing on, stopped\nand, with a friendly smile, held out her hand.  Mr. Sharp shook it\nconvulsively.\n\n\"You are just the man I want to see,\" she exclaimed.  \"Aunt and I have\nbeen talking about you all the afternoon.\"\n\nMr. Sharp said \"Really!\"\n\n\"But I don't want uncle to see us,\" pursued Miss Garland, in the low\ntones of confidence.  \"Which way shall we go?\"\n\nMr. Sharp's brain reeled.  All ways were alike to him in such company.\nHe walked beside her like a man in a dream.\n\n\"We want to give him a lesson,\" said the girl, presently.  \"A lesson that\nhe will remember.\"\n\n\"Him?\"  said the young man.\n\n\"Uncle,\" explained the girl.  \"It's a shocking thing, a wicked thing, to\ntry and upset a steady young man like you.  Aunt is quite put out about\nit, and I feel the same as she does.\"\n\n\"But,\" gasped the astonished Mr. Sharp, \"how did you?\"\n\n\"Aunt heard him,\" said Miss Garland.  \"She was just going into the room\nwhen she caught a word or two, and she stayed outside and listened.  You\ndon't know what a lot she thinks of you.\"\n\nMr. Sharp's eyes opened wider than ever.  \"I thought she didn't like me,\"\nhe said, slowly.\n\n\"Good gracious!\"  said Miss Garland.  \"Whatever could have put such an\nidea as that into your head?  Of course, aunt isn't always going to let\nuncle see that she agrees with him.  Still, as if anybody could help--\"\nshe murmured to herself.\n\n\"Eh?\"  said the young man, in a trembling voice.\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nMiss Garland walked along with averted face; Mr. Sharp, his pulses\nbounding, trod on air beside her.\n\n\"I thought,\" he said, at last \"I thought that Jack Butler was a favourite\nof hers?\"\n\n\"Jack Butler!\"  said the girl, in tones of scornful surprise.  \"The idea!\nHow blind men are; you're all alike, I think.  You can't see two inches\nin front of you.  She's as pleased as possible that you are coming on\nWednesday; and so am--\"\n\nMr. Sharp caught his breath.  \"Yes?\"  he murmured.\n\n\"Let's go down here,\" said Miss Garland quickly; \"down by the river.  And\nI'll tell you what we want you to do.\"\n\nShe placed her hand lightly on his arm, and Mr. Sharp, with a tremulous\nsmile, obeyed.  The smile faded gradually as he listened, and an\nexpression of anxious astonishment took its place.  He shook his head as\nshe proceeded, and twice ventured a faint suggestion that she was only\nspeaking in jest.  Convinced at last, against his will, he walked on in\nsilent consternation.\n\n\"But,\" he said at last, as Miss Garland paused for breath, \"your uncle\nwould never forgive me.  He'd never let me come near the house again.\"\n\n\"Aunt will see to that,\" said the girl, confidently.  \"But, of course, if\nyou don't wish to please me--\"\n\nShe turned away, and Mr. Sharp, plucking up spirit, ventured to take her\nhand and squeeze it.  A faint, a very faint, squeeze in return decided\nhim.\n\n\"It will come all right afterwards,\" said Miss Garland, \"especially with\nthe hold it will give aunt over him.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" said the young man.  \"If not, I shall be far--farther off\nthan ever.\"\n\nMiss Garland blushed and, turning her head, gazed steadily at the river.\n\n\"Trust me,\" she said at last.  \"Me and auntie.\"\n\nMr. Sharp said that so long as he pleased her nothing else mattered, and,\nin the seventh heaven of delight, paced slowly along the towpath by her\nside.\n\n\"And you mustn't mind what auntie and I say to you,\" said the girl,\ncontinuing her instructions.  \"We must keep up appearances, you know; and\nif we seem to be angry, you must remember we are only pretending.\"\n\nMr. Sharp, with a tender smile, said that he understood perfectly.\n\n\"And now I had better go,\" said Florrie, returning the smile.  \"Uncle\nmight see us together, or somebody else might see us and tell him.\nGood-bye.\"\n\nShe shook hands and went off, stopping three times to turn and wave her\nhand.  In a state of bewildered delight Mr. Sharp continued his stroll,\nrehearsing, as he went, the somewhat complicated and voluminous\ninstructions she had given him.\n\nBy Wednesday evening he was part-perfect, and, in a state of mind divided\nbetween nervousness and exaltation, set out for Mr. Culpepper's.  He\nfound that gentleman, dressed in his best, sitting in an easy-chair with\nhis hands folded over a fancy waistcoat of startling design, and, placing\na small box of small cigars on his knees, wished him the usual \"Happy\nReturns.\"  The entrance of the ladies, who seemed as though they had just\ncome off the ice, interrupted Mr. Culpepper's thanks.\n\n\"Getting spoiled, that's what I am,\" he remarked, playfully.  \"See this\nwaistcoat?  My old Aunt Elizabeth sent it this morning.\"\n\nHe leaned back in his chair and glanced down in warm approval.  \"The\nmissis gave me a pipe, and Florrie gave me half a pound of tobacco.  And\nI bought a bottle of port wine myself, for all of us.\"\n\nHe pointed to a bottle that stood on the supper-table, and, the ladies\nretiring to the kitchen to bring in the supper, rose and placed chairs.\nA piece of roast beef was placed before him, and, motioning Mr. Sharp to\na seat opposite Florrie, he began to carve.\n\n\"Just a nice comfortable party,\" he said, genially, as he finished.\n\"Help yourself to the ale, Bert.\"\n\nMr. Sharp, ignoring the surprise on the faces of the ladies, complied,\nand passed the bottle to Mr. Culpepper.  They drank to each other, and\nagain a flicker of surprise appeared on the faces of Mrs. Culpepper and\nher niece.  Mr. Culpepper, noticing it, shook his head waggishly at Mr.\nSharp.\n\n\"He drinks it as if he likes it,\" he remarked.\n\n\"I do,\" asserted Mr. Sharp, and, raising his glass, emptied it, and\nresumed the attack on his plate.  Mr. Culpepper unscrewed the top of\nanother bottle, and the reckless Mr. Sharp, after helping himself, made a\nshort and feeling speech, in which he wished Mr. Culpepper long life and\nhappiness.  \"If you ain't happy with Mrs. Culpepper,\" he concluded,\ngallantly, \"you ought to be.\"\n\nMr. Culpepper nodded and went on eating in silence until, the keen edge\nof his appetite having been taken off, he put down his knife and fork and\nwaxed sentimental.\n\n\"Been married over thirty years,\" he said, slowly, with a glance at his\nwife, \"and never regretted it.\"\n\n\"Who hasn't?\"  inquired Mr. Sharp.\n\n\"Why, me,\" returned the surprised Mr. Culpepper.\n\nMr. Sharp, who had just raised his glass, put it down again and smiled.\nIt was a faint smile, but it seemed to affect his host unfavourably.\n\n\"What are you smiling at?\"  he demanded.\n\n\"Thoughts,\" said Mr. Sharp, exchanging a covert glance with Florrie.\n\"Something you told me the other day.\"\n\nMr. Culpepper looked bewildered.  \"I'll give you a penny for them\nthoughts,\" he said, with an air of jocosity.\n\nMr. Sharp shook his head.  \"Money couldn't buy 'em,\" he said, with owlish\nsolemnity, \"espec--especially after the good supper you're giving me.\"\n\n\"Bert,\" said Mr. Culpepper, uneasily, as his wife sat somewhat erect\n\"Bert, it's my birthday, and I don't grudge nothing to nobody; but go\neasy with the beer.  You ain't used to it, you know.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with the beer?\"  inquired Mr. Sharp.  \"It tastes all\nright--what there is of it.\"\n\n\"It ain't the beer; it's you,\" explained Mr. Culpepper.\n\nMr. Sharp stared at him.  \"Have I said anything I oughtn't to?\"  he\ninquired.\n\nMr. Culpepper shook his head, and, taking up a fork and spoon, began to\nserve a plum-pudding that Miss Garland had just placed on the table.\n\n\"What was it you said I was to be sure and not tell Mrs. Culpepper?\"\ninquired Mr. Sharp, dreamily.  \"I haven't said that, have I?\"\n\n\"No!\"  snapped the harassed Mr. Culpepper, laying down the fork and spoon\nand regarding him ferociously.  \"I mean, there wasn't anything.  I mean,\nI didn't say so.  You're raving.\"\n\n\"If I did say it, I'm sorry,\" persisted Mr. Sharp.  \"I can't say fairer\nthan that, can I?\"\n\n\"You're all right,\" said Mr. Culpepper, trying, but in vain, to exchange\na waggish glance with his wife.\n\n\"I didn't say it?\"  inquired Mr. Sharp.\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Culpepper, still smiling in a wooden fashion.\n\n\"I mean the other thing?\"  said Mr. Sharp, in a thrilling whisper.\n\n\"Look here,\" exclaimed the overwrought Mr. Culpepper; \"why not eat your\npudding, and leave off talking nonsense?  Nobody's listening to you.\"\n\n\"Speak for yourself,\" said his wife, tartly.  \"I like to hear Mr. Sharp\ntalk.  What was it he told you not to tell me?\"\n\nMr. Sharp eyed her mistily.  \"I--I can't tell you,\" he said, slowly.\n\n\"Why not?\"  asked Mrs. Culpepper, coaxingly.\n\n\"Because it--it would make your hair stand on end,\" said the industrious\nMr. Sharp.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Mrs. Culpepper, sharply.\n\n\"He said it would,\" said Mr. Sharp, indicating his host with his spoon,\n\"and he ought--to know-- Who's that kicking me under the table?\"\n\nMr. Culpepper, shivering with wrath and dread, struggled for speech.\n\"You'd better get home, Bert,\" he said at last.  \"You're not yourself.\nThere's nobody kicking you under the table.  You don't know what you are\nsaying.  You've been dreaming things.  I never said anything of the\nkind.\"\n\n\"Memory's gone,\" said Mr. Sharp, shaking his head at him.  \"Clean gone.\nDon't you remember--\"\n\n\"NO!\"  roared Mr. Culpepper.\n\nMr. Sharp sat blinking at him, but his misgivings vanished before the\nglances of admiring devotion which Miss Garland was sending in his\ndirection.  He construed them rightly not only as a reward, but as an\nincentive to further efforts.  In the midst of an impressive silence Mrs.\nCulpepper collected the plates and, producing a dish of fruit from the\nsideboard, placed it upon the table.\n\n\"Help yourself, Mr. Sharp,\" she said, pushing the bottle of port towards\nhim.\n\nMr. Sharp complied, having first, after several refusals, put a little\ninto the ladies' glasses, and a lot on the tablecloth near Mr. Culpepper.\nThen, after a satisfying sip or two, he rose with a bland smile and\nannounced his intention of making a speech.\n\n\"But you've made one,\" said his host, in tones of fierce expostulation.\n\n\"That--that was las' night,\" said Mr. Sharp.  \"This is to-night--your\nbirthday.\"\n\n\"Well, we don't want any more,\" said Mr. Culpepper.\n\nMr. Sharp hesitated.  \"It's only his fun,\" he said, looking round and\nraising his glass.  \"He's afraid I'm going to praise him up--praise him\nup.  Here's to my old friend, Mr. Culpepper: one of the best.  We all\nhave our--faults, and he has his--has his.  Where was I?\"\n\n\"Sit down,\" growled Mr. Culpepper.\n\n\"Talking about my husband's faults,\" said his wife.\n\n\"So I was,\" said Mr. Sharp, putting his hand to his brow.  \"Don't be\nalarm',\" he continued, turning to his host; \"nothing to be alarm' about.\nI'm not going to talk about 'em.  Not so silly as that, I hope.  I don't\nwant spoil your life.\"\n\n\"Sit down,\" repeated Mr. Culpepper.\n\n\"You're very anxious he should sit down,\" said his wife, sharply.\n\n\"No, I'm not,\" said Mr. Culpepper; \"only he's talking nonsense.\"\n\nMr. Sharp, still on his legs, took another sip of port and, avoiding the\neye of Mr. Culpepper, which was showing signs of incipient inflammation,\nlooked for encouragement to Miss Garland.\n\n\"He's a man we all look up to and respect,\" he continued.  \"If he does go\noff to London every now and then on business, that's his lookout.  My\nidea is he always ought to take Mrs. Culpepper with him.\n\n\"He'd have pleasure of her company and, same time, he'd be money in pocket\nby it.  And why shouldn't she go to music-halls sometimes?  Why shouldn't\nshe--\"\n\n\"You get off home,\" said the purple Mr. Culpepper, rising and hammering\nthe table with his fist.  \"Get off home; and if you so much as show your\nface inside this 'ouse again there'll be trouble.  Go on.  Out you go!\"\n\n\"Home?\"  repeated Mr. Sharp, sitting down suddenly.  \"Won't go home till\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Oh, we'll soon see about that,\" said Mr. Culpepper, taking him by the\nshoulders.  \"Come on, now.\"\n\nMr. Sharp subsided lumpishly into his chair, and Mr. Culpepper, despite\nhis utmost efforts, failed to move him.  The two ladies exchanged a\nglance, and then, with their heads in the air, sailed out of the room,\nthe younger pausing at the door to bestow a mirthful glance upon Mr.\nSharp ere she disappeared.\n\n\"Come--out,\" said Mr. Culpepper, panting.\n\n\"You trying to tickle me?\"  inquired Mr. Sharp.\n\n\"You get off home,\" said the other.  \"You've been doing nothing but make\nmischief ever since you came in.  What put such things into your silly\nhead I don't know.  I shall never hear the end of 'em as long as I live.\"\n\n\"Silly head?\"  repeated Mr. Sharp, with an alarming change of manner.\n\"Say it again.\"\n\nMr. Culpepper repeated it with gusto.\n\n\"Very good,\" said Mr. Sharp.  He seized him suddenly and, pushing him\nbackwards into his easychair, stood over him with such hideous\ncontortions of visage that Mr. Culpepper was horrified.  \"Now you sit\nthere and keep quite still,\" he said, with smouldering ferocity.  \"Where\ndid you put carving-knife?  Eh?  Where's carving-knife?\"\n\n\"No, no, Bert,\" said Mr. Culpepper, clutching at his sleeve.  \"I--I was\nonly joking.  You--you ain't quite yourself, Bert.\"\n\n\"What?\"  demanded the other, rolling his eyes, and clenching his fists.\n\n\"I--I mean you've improved,\" said Mr. Culpepper, hurriedly.  \"Wonderful,\nyou have.\"\n\nMr. Sharp's countenance cleared a little.  \"Let's make a night of it,\" he\nsaid.  \"Don't move, whatever you do.\"\n\nHe closed the door and, putting the wine and a couple of glasses on the\nmantelpiece, took a chair by Mr. Culpepper and prepared to spend the\nevening.  His instructions were too specific to be disregarded, and three\ntimes he placed his arm about the waist of the frenzied Mr. Culpepper and\ntook him for a lumbering dance up and down the room.  In the intervals\nbetween dances he regaled him with interminable extracts from speeches\nmade at the debating society and recitations learned at school.\nSuggestions relating to bed, thrown out by Mr. Culpepper from time to\ntime, were repelled with scorn.  And twice, in deference to Mr. Sharp's\ndesires, he had to join in the chorus of a song.\n\nTen o'clock passed, and the hands of the clock crawled round to eleven.\nThe hour struck, and, as though in answer, the door opened and the\nagreeable face of Florrie Garland appeared.  Behind her, to the intense\nsurprise of both gentlemen, loomed the stalwart figure of Mr. Jack\nButler.\n\n\"I thought he might be useful, uncle,\" said Miss Garland, coming into the\nroom.  \"Auntie wouldn't let me come down before.\"\n\nMr. Sharp rose in a dazed fashion and saw Mr. Culpepper grasp Mr. Butler\nby the hand.  More dazed still, he felt the large and clumsy hand of Mr.\nButler take him by the collar and propel him with some violence along the\nsmall passage, while another hand, which he dimly recognized as belonging\nto Mr. Culpepper, was inserted in the small of his back.  Then the front\ndoor opened and he was thrust out into the night.  The door closed, and a\nlow feminine laugh sounded from a window above.",
