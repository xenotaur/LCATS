    "body": "\n      An honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to him a\n      great many years, but was now growing old and every day more and more\n      unfit for work. His master therefore was tired of keeping him and began to\n      think of putting an end to him; but the ass, who saw that some mischief\n      was in the wind, took himself slyly off, and began his journey towards the\n      great city, \u2018For there,\u2019 thought he, \u2018I may turn musician.\u2019\n    \n\n      After he had travelled a little way, he spied a dog lying by the roadside\n      and panting as if he were tired. \u2018What makes you pant so, my friend?\u2019 said\n      the ass. \u2018Alas!\u2019 said the dog, \u2018my master was going to knock me on the\n      head, because I am old and weak, and can no longer make myself useful to\n      him in hunting; so I ran away; but what can I do to earn my livelihood?\u2019\n      \u2018Hark ye!\u2019 said the ass, \u2018I am going to the great city to turn musician:\n      suppose you go with me, and try what you can do in the same way?\u2019 The dog\n      said he was willing, and they jogged on together.\n    \n\n      They had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the\n      road and making a most rueful face. \u2018Pray, my good lady,\u2019 said the ass,\n      \u2018what\u2019s the matter with you? You look quite out of spirits!\u2019 \u2018Ah, me!\u2019\n      said the cat, \u2018how can one be in good spirits when one\u2019s life is in\n      danger? Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my ease\n      by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress laid hold\n      of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky enough to\n      get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon.\u2019 \u2018Oh,\u2019 said the\n      ass, \u2018by all means go with us to the great city; you are a good night\n      singer, and may make your fortune as a musician.\u2019 The cat was pleased with\n      the thought, and joined the party.\n    \n\n      Soon afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a cock\n      perched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main.\n      \u2018Bravo!\u2019 said the ass; \u2018upon my word, you make a famous noise; pray what\n      is all this about?\u2019 \u2018Why,\u2019 said the cock, \u2018I was just now saying that we\n      should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and the\n      cook don\u2019t thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my head\n      tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming on Sunday!\u2019\n      \u2018Heaven forbid!\u2019 said the ass, \u2018come with us Master Chanticleer; it will\n      be better, at any rate, than staying here to have your head cut off!\n      Besides, who knows? If we care to sing in tune, we may get up some kind of\n      a concert; so come along with us.\u2019 \u2018With all my heart,\u2019 said the cock: so\n      they all four went on jollily together.\n    \n\n      They could not, however, reach the great city the first day; so when night\n      came on, they went into a wood to sleep. The ass and the dog laid\n      themselves down under a great tree, and the cat climbed up into the\n      branches; while the cock, thinking that the higher he sat the safer he\n      should be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and then, according to his\n      custom, before he went to sleep, looked out on all sides of him to see\n      that everything was well. In doing this, he saw afar off something bright\n      and shining and calling to his companions said, \u2018There must be a house no\n      great way off, for I see a light.\u2019 \u2018If that be the case,\u2019 said the ass,\n      \u2018we had better change our quarters, for our lodging is not the best in the\n      world!\u2019 \u2018Besides,\u2019 added the dog, \u2018I should not be the worse for a bone or\n      two, or a bit of meat.\u2019 So they walked off together towards the spot where\n      Chanticleer had seen the light, and as they drew near it became larger and\n      brighter, till they at last came close to a house in which a gang of\n      robbers lived.\n    \n\n      The ass, being the tallest of the company, marched up to the window and\n      peeped in. \u2018Well, Donkey,\u2019 said Chanticleer, \u2018what do you see?\u2019 \u2018What do I\n      see?\u2019 replied the ass. \u2018Why, I see a table spread with all kinds of good\n      things, and robbers sitting round it making merry.\u2019 \u2018That would be a noble\n      lodging for us,\u2019 said the cock. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said the ass, \u2018if we could only get\n      in\u2019; so they consulted together how they should contrive to get the\n      robbers out; and at last they hit upon a plan. The ass placed himself\n      upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the window;\n      the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dog\u2019s shoulders,\n      and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat\u2019s head. When all was ready a\n      signal was given, and they began their music. The ass brayed, the dog\n      barked, the cat mewed, and the cock screamed; and then they all broke\n      through the window at once, and came tumbling into the room, amongst the\n      broken glass, with a most hideous clatter! The robbers, who had been not a\n      little frightened by the opening concert, had now no doubt that some\n      frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon them, and scampered away as fast as\n      they could.\n    \n\n      The coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what the\n      robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected to\n      eat again for a month. As soon as they had satisfied themselves, they put\n      out the lights, and each once more sought out a resting-place to his own\n      liking. The donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in the yard, the\n      dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door, the cat rolled herself\n      up on the hearth before the warm ashes, and the cock perched upon a beam\n      on the top of the house; and, as they were all rather tired with their\n      journey, they soon fell asleep.\n    \n\n      But about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were\n      out and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had been in\n      too great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder than the\n      rest, went to see what was going on. Finding everything still, he marched\n      into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a match in order to light\n      a candle; and then, espying the glittering fiery eyes of the cat, he\n      mistook them for live coals, and held the match to them to light it. But\n      the cat, not understanding this joke, sprang at his face, and spat, and\n      scratched at him. This frightened him dreadfully, and away he ran to the\n      back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the leg; and as he\n      was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the cock, who had been\n      awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might. At this the robber ran\n      back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told the captain how a\n      horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at him and scratched his\n      face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a knife in his hand had\n      hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him in the leg; how a black\n      monster stood in the yard and struck him with a club, and how the devil\n      had sat upon the top of the house and cried out, \u2018Throw the rascal up\n      here!\u2019 After this the robbers never dared to go back to the house; but the\n      musicians were so pleased with their quarters that they took up their\n      abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at this very day.\n    ",
