    "name": "Grimm - the Story Of the Youth Who Went Forth To Learn What Fear Was",
    "body": "\n      A certain father had two sons, the elder of who was smart and sensible,\n      and could do everything, but the younger was stupid and could neither\n      learn nor understand anything, and when people saw him they said: \u2018There\u2019s\n      a fellow who will give his father some trouble!\u2019 When anything had to be\n      done, it was always the elder who was forced to do it; but if his father\n      bade him fetch anything when it was late, or in the night-time, and the\n      way led through the churchyard, or any other dismal place, he answered:\n      \u2018Oh, no father, I\u2019ll not go there, it makes me shudder!\u2019 for he was\n      afraid. Or when stories were told by the fire at night which made the\n      flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said: \u2018Oh, it makes us shudder!\u2019 The\n      younger sat in a corner and listened with the rest of them, and could not\n      imagine what they could mean. \u2018They are always saying: \u201cIt makes me\n      shudder, it makes me shudder!\u201d It does not make me shudder,\u2019 thought he.\n      \u2018That, too, must be an art of which I understand nothing!\u2019\n    \n\n      Now it came to pass that his father said to him one day: \u2018Hearken to me,\n      you fellow in the corner there, you are growing tall and strong, and you\n      too must learn something by which you can earn your bread. Look how your\n      brother works, but you do not even earn your salt.\u2019 \u2018Well, father,\u2019 he\n      replied, \u2018I am quite willing to learn something\u2014indeed, if it could\n      but be managed, I should like to learn how to shudder. I don\u2019t understand\n      that at all yet.\u2019 The elder brother smiled when he heard that, and thought\n      to himself: \u2018Goodness, what a blockhead that brother of mine is! He will\n      never be good for anything as long as he lives! He who wants to be a\n      sickle must bend himself betimes.\u2019\n    \n\n      The father sighed, and answered him: \u2018You shall soon learn what it is to\n      shudder, but you will not earn your bread by that.\u2019\n    \n\n      Soon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and the father\n      bewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was so backward in\n      every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing. \u2018Just think,\u2019 said\n      he, \u2018when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread, he actually\n      wanted to learn to shudder.\u2019 \u2018If that be all,\u2019 replied the sexton, \u2018he can\n      learn that with me. Send him to me, and I will soon polish him.\u2019 The\n      father was glad to do it, for he thought: \u2018It will train the boy a\n      little.\u2019 The sexton therefore took him into his house, and he had to ring\n      the church bell. After a day or two, the sexton awoke him at midnight, and\n      bade him arise and go up into the church tower and ring the bell. \u2018You\n      shall soon learn what shuddering is,\u2019 thought he, and secretly went there\n      before him; and when the boy was at the top of the tower and turned round,\n      and was just going to take hold of the bell rope, he saw a white figure\n      standing on the stairs opposite the sounding hole. \u2018Who is there?\u2019 cried\n      he, but the figure made no reply, and did not move or stir. \u2018Give an\n      answer,\u2019 cried the boy, \u2018or take yourself off, you have no business here\n      at night.\u2019\n    \n\n      The sexton, however, remained standing motionless that the boy might think\n      he was a ghost. The boy cried a second time: \u2018What do you want here?\u2014speak\n      if you are an honest fellow, or I will throw you down the steps!\u2019 The\n      sexton thought: \u2018He can\u2019t mean to be as bad as his words,\u2019 uttered no\n      sound and stood as if he were made of stone. Then the boy called to him\n      for the third time, and as that was also to no purpose, he ran against him\n      and pushed the ghost down the stairs, so that it fell down the ten steps\n      and remained lying there in a corner. Thereupon he rang the bell, went\n      home, and without saying a word went to bed, and fell asleep. The sexton\u2019s\n      wife waited a long time for her husband, but he did not come back. At\n      length she became uneasy, and wakened the boy, and asked: \u2018Do you know\n      where my husband is? He climbed up the tower before you did.\u2019 \u2018No, I don\u2019t\n      know,\u2019 replied the boy, \u2018but someone was standing by the sounding hole on\n      the other side of the steps, and as he would neither give an answer nor go\n      away, I took him for a scoundrel, and threw him downstairs. Just go there\n      and you will see if it was he. I should be sorry if it were.\u2019 The woman\n      ran away and found her husband, who was lying moaning in the corner, and\n      had broken his leg.\n    \n\n      She carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the boy\u2019s\n      father, \u2018Your boy,\u2019 cried she, \u2018has been the cause of a great misfortune!\n      He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke his leg. Take the\n      good-for-nothing fellow out of our house.\u2019 The father was terrified, and\n      ran thither and scolded the boy. \u2018What wicked tricks are these?\u2019 said he.\n      \u2018The devil must have put them into your head.\u2019 \u2018Father,\u2019 he replied, \u2018do\n      listen to me. I am quite innocent. He was standing there by night like one\n      intent on doing evil. I did not know who it was, and I entreated him three\n      times either to speak or to go away.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 said the father, \u2018I have\n      nothing but unhappiness with you. Go out of my sight. I will see you no\n      more.\u2019\n    \n\n      \u2018Yes, father, right willingly, wait only until it is day. Then will I go\n      forth and learn how to shudder, and then I shall, at any rate, understand\n      one art which will support me.\u2019 \u2018Learn what you will,\u2019 spoke the father,\n      \u2018it is all the same to me. Here are fifty talers for you. Take these and\n      go into the wide world, and tell no one from whence you come, and who is\n      your father, for I have reason to be ashamed of you.\u2019 \u2018Yes, father, it\n      shall be as you will. If you desire nothing more than that, I can easily\n      keep it in mind.\u2019\n    \n\n      When the day dawned, therefore, the boy put his fifty talers into his\n      pocket, and went forth on the great highway, and continually said to\n      himself: \u2018If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!\u2019 Then a man\n      approached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with\n      himself, and when they had walked a little farther to where they could see\n      the gallows, the man said to him: \u2018Look, there is the tree where seven men\n      have married the ropemaker\u2019s daughter, and are now learning how to fly.\n      Sit down beneath it, and wait till night comes, and you will soon learn\n      how to shudder.\u2019 \u2018If that is all that is wanted,\u2019 answered the youth, \u2018it\n      is easily done; but if I learn how to shudder as fast as that, you shall\n      have my fifty talers. Just come back to me early in the morning.\u2019 Then the\n      youth went to the gallows, sat down beneath it, and waited till evening\n      came. And as he was cold, he lighted himself a fire, but at midnight the\n      wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire, he could not get warm. And\n      as the wind knocked the hanged men against each other, and they moved\n      backwards and forwards, he thought to himself: \u2018If you shiver below by the\n      fire, how those up above must freeze and suffer!\u2019 And as he felt pity for\n      them, he raised the ladder, and climbed up, unbound one of them after the\n      other, and brought down all seven. Then he stoked the fire, blew it, and\n      set them all round it to warm themselves. But they sat there and did not\n      stir, and the fire caught their clothes. So he said: \u2018Take care, or I will\n      hang you up again.\u2019 The dead men, however, did not hear, but were quite\n      silent, and let their rags go on burning. At this he grew angry, and said:\n      \u2018If you will not take care, I cannot help you, I will not be burnt with\n      you,\u2019 and he hung them up again each in his turn. Then he sat down by his\n      fire and fell asleep, and the next morning the man came to him and wanted\n      to have the fifty talers, and said: \u2018Well do you know how to shudder?\u2019\n      \u2018No,\u2019 answered he, \u2018how should I know? Those fellows up there did not open\n      their mouths, and were so stupid that they let the few old rags which they\n      had on their bodies get burnt.\u2019 Then the man saw that he would not get the\n      fifty talers that day, and went away saying: \u2018Such a youth has never come\n      my way before.\u2019\n    \n\n      The youth likewise went his way, and once more began to mutter to himself:\n      \u2018Ah, if I could but shudder! Ah, if I could but shudder!\u2019 A waggoner who\n      was striding behind him heard this and asked: \u2018Who are you?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t\n      know,\u2019 answered the youth. Then the waggoner asked: \u2018From whence do you\n      come?\u2019 \u2018I know not.\u2019 \u2018Who is your father?\u2019 \u2018That I may not tell you.\u2019\n      \u2018What is it that you are always muttering between your teeth?\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019\n      replied the youth, \u2018I do so wish I could shudder, but no one can teach me\n      how.\u2019 \u2018Enough of your foolish chatter,\u2019 said the waggoner. \u2018Come, go with\n      me, I will see about a place for you.\u2019 The youth went with the waggoner,\n      and in the evening they arrived at an inn where they wished to pass the\n      night. Then at the entrance of the parlour the youth again said quite\n      loudly: \u2018If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!\u2019 The host who\n      heard this, laughed and said: \u2018If that is your desire, there ought to be a\n      good opportunity for you here.\u2019 \u2018Ah, be silent,\u2019 said the hostess, \u2018so\n      many prying persons have already lost their lives, it would be a pity and\n      a shame if such beautiful eyes as these should never see the daylight\n      again.\u2019\n    \n\n      But the youth said: \u2018However difficult it may be, I will learn it. For\n      this purpose indeed have I journeyed forth.\u2019 He let the host have no rest,\n      until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood a haunted castle\n      where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was, if he would but\n      watch in it for three nights. The king had promised that he who would\n      venture should have his daughter to wife, and she was the most beautiful\n      maiden the sun shone on. Likewise in the castle lay great treasures, which\n      were guarded by evil spirits, and these treasures would then be freed, and\n      would make a poor man rich enough. Already many men had gone into the\n      castle, but as yet none had come out again. Then the youth went next\n      morning to the king, and said: \u2018If it be allowed, I will willingly watch\n      three nights in the haunted castle.\u2019\n    \n\n      The king looked at him, and as the youth pleased him, he said: \u2018You may\n      ask for three things to take into the castle with you, but they must be\n      things without life.\u2019 Then he answered: \u2018Then I ask for a fire, a turning\n      lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife.\u2019\n    \n\n      The king had these things carried into the castle for him during the day.\n      When night was drawing near, the youth went up and made himself a bright\n      fire in one of the rooms, placed the cutting-board and knife beside it,\n      and seated himself by the turning-lathe. \u2018Ah, if I could but shudder!\u2019\n      said he, \u2018but I shall not learn it here either.\u2019 Towards midnight he was\n      about to poke his fire, and as he was blowing it, something cried suddenly\n      from one corner: \u2018Au, miau! how cold we are!\u2019 \u2018You fools!\u2019 cried he, \u2018what\n      are you crying about? If you are cold, come and take a seat by the fire\n      and warm yourselves.\u2019 And when he had said that, two great black cats came\n      with one tremendous leap and sat down on each side of him, and looked\n      savagely at him with their fiery eyes. After a short time, when they had\n      warmed themselves, they said: \u2018Comrade, shall we have a game of cards?\u2019\n      \u2018Why not?\u2019 he replied, \u2018but just show me your paws.\u2019 Then they stretched\n      out their claws. \u2018Oh,\u2019 said he, \u2018what long nails you have! Wait, I must\n      first cut them for you.\u2019 Thereupon he seized them by the throats, put them\n      on the cutting-board and screwed their feet fast. \u2018I have looked at your\n      fingers,\u2019 said he, \u2018and my fancy for card-playing has gone,\u2019 and he struck\n      them dead and threw them out into the water. But when he had made away\n      with these two, and was about to sit down again by his fire, out from\n      every hole and corner came black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains,\n      and more and more of them came until he could no longer move, and they\n      yelled horribly, and got on his fire, pulled it to pieces, and tried to\n      put it out. He watched them for a while quietly, but at last when they\n      were going too far, he seized his cutting-knife, and cried: \u2018Away with\n      you, vermin,\u2019 and began to cut them down. Some of them ran away, the\n      others he killed, and threw out into the fish-pond. When he came back he\n      fanned the embers of his fire again and warmed himself. And as he thus\n      sat, his eyes would keep open no longer, and he felt a desire to sleep.\n      Then he looked round and saw a great bed in the corner. \u2018That is the very\n      thing for me,\u2019 said he, and got into it. When he was just going to shut\n      his eyes, however, the bed began to move of its own accord, and went over\n      the whole of the castle. \u2018That\u2019s right,\u2019 said he, \u2018but go faster.\u2019 Then\n      the bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it, up and down, over\n      thresholds and stairs, but suddenly hop, hop, it turned over upside down,\n      and lay on him like a mountain. But he threw quilts and pillows up in the\n      air, got out and said: \u2018Now anyone who likes, may drive,\u2019 and lay down by\n      his fire, and slept till it was day. In the morning the king came, and\n      when he saw him lying there on the ground, he thought the evil spirits had\n      killed him and he was dead. Then said he: \u2018After all it is a pity,\u2014for\n      so handsome a man.\u2019 The youth heard it, got up, and said: \u2018It has not come\n      to that yet.\u2019 Then the king was astonished, but very glad, and asked how\n      he had fared. \u2018Very well indeed,\u2019 answered he; \u2018one night is past, the two\n      others will pass likewise.\u2019 Then he went to the innkeeper, who opened his\n      eyes very wide, and said: \u2018I never expected to see you alive again! Have\n      you learnt how to shudder yet?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said he, \u2018it is all in vain. If\n      someone would but tell me!\u2019\n    \n\n      The second night he again went up into the old castle, sat down by the\n      fire, and once more began his old song: \u2018If I could but shudder!\u2019 When\n      midnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard; at first\n      it was low, but it grew louder and louder. Then it was quiet for a while,\n      and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down the chimney and\n      fell before him. \u2018Hullo!\u2019 cried he, \u2018another half belongs to this. This is\n      not enough!\u2019 Then the uproar began again, there was a roaring and howling,\n      and the other half fell down likewise. \u2018Wait,\u2019 said he, \u2018I will just stoke\n      up the fire a little for you.\u2019 When he had done that and looked round\n      again, the two pieces were joined together, and a hideous man was sitting\n      in his place. \u2018That is no part of our bargain,\u2019 said the youth, \u2018the bench\n      is mine.\u2019 The man wanted to push him away; the youth, however, would not\n      allow that, but thrust him off with all his strength, and seated himself\n      again in his own place. Then still more men fell down, one after the\n      other; they brought nine dead men\u2019s legs and two skulls, and set them up\n      and played at nine-pins with them. The youth also wanted to play and said:\n      \u2018Listen you, can I join you?\u2019 \u2018Yes, if you have any money.\u2019 \u2018Money\n      enough,\u2019 replied he, \u2018but your balls are not quite round.\u2019 Then he took\n      the skulls and put them in the lathe and turned them till they were round.\n      \u2018There, now they will roll better!\u2019 said he. \u2018Hurrah! now we\u2019ll have fun!\u2019\n      He played with them and lost some of his money, but when it struck twelve,\n      everything vanished from his sight. He lay down and quietly fell asleep.\n      Next morning the king came to inquire after him. \u2018How has it fared with\n      you this time?\u2019 asked he. \u2018I have been playing at nine-pins,\u2019 he answered,\n      \u2018and have lost a couple of farthings.\u2019 \u2018Have you not shuddered then?\u2019\n      \u2018What?\u2019 said he, \u2018I have had a wonderful time! If I did but know what it\n      was to shudder!\u2019\n    \n\n      The third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly: \u2018If I\n      could but shudder.\u2019 When it grew late, six tall men came in and brought a\n      coffin. Then he said: \u2018Ha, ha, that is certainly my little cousin, who\n      died only a few days ago,\u2019 and he beckoned with his finger, and cried:\n      \u2018Come, little cousin, come.\u2019 They placed the coffin on the ground, but he\n      went to it and took the lid off, and a dead man lay therein. He felt his\n      face, but it was cold as ice. \u2018Wait,\u2019 said he, \u2018I will warm you a little,\u2019\n      and went to the fire and warmed his hand and laid it on the dead man\u2019s\n      face, but he remained cold. Then he took him out, and sat down by the fire\n      and laid him on his breast and rubbed his arms that the blood might\n      circulate again. As this also did no good, he thought to himself: \u2018When\n      two people lie in bed together, they warm each other,\u2019 and carried him to\n      the bed, covered him over and lay down by him. After a short time the dead\n      man became warm too, and began to move. Then said the youth, \u2018See, little\n      cousin, have I not warmed you?\u2019 The dead man, however, got up and cried:\n      \u2018Now will I strangle you.\u2019\n    \n\n      \u2018What!\u2019 said he, \u2018is that the way you thank me? You shall at once go into\n      your coffin again,\u2019 and he took him up, threw him into it, and shut the\n      lid. Then came the six men and carried him away again. \u2018I cannot manage to\n      shudder,\u2019 said he. \u2018I shall never learn it here as long as I live.\u2019\n    \n\n      Then a man entered who was taller than all others, and looked terrible. He\n      was old, however, and had a long white beard. \u2018You wretch,\u2019 cried he, \u2018you\n      shall soon learn what it is to shudder, for you shall die.\u2019 \u2018Not so fast,\u2019\n      replied the youth. \u2018If I am to die, I shall have to have a say in it.\u2019 \u2018I\n      will soon seize you,\u2019 said the fiend. \u2018Softly, softly, do not talk so big.\n      I am as strong as you are, and perhaps even stronger.\u2019 \u2018We shall see,\u2019\n      said the old man. \u2018If you are stronger, I will let you go\u2014come, we\n      will try.\u2019 Then he led him by dark passages to a smith\u2019s forge, took an\n      axe, and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground. \u2018I can do better\n      than that,\u2019 said the youth, and went to the other anvil. The old man\n      placed himself near and wanted to look on, and his white beard hung down.\n      Then the youth seized the axe, split the anvil with one blow, and in it\n      caught the old man\u2019s beard. \u2018Now I have you,\u2019 said the youth. \u2018Now it is\n      your turn to die.\u2019 Then he seized an iron bar and beat the old man till he\n      moaned and entreated him to stop, when he would give him great riches. The\n      youth drew out the axe and let him go. The old man led him back into the\n      castle, and in a cellar showed him three chests full of gold. \u2018Of these,\u2019\n      said he, \u2018one part is for the poor, the other for the king, the third\n      yours.\u2019 In the meantime it struck twelve, and the spirit disappeared, so\n      that the youth stood in darkness. \u2018I shall still be able to find my way\n      out,\u2019 said he, and felt about, found the way into the room, and slept\n      there by his fire. Next morning the king came and said: \u2018Now you must have\n      learnt what shuddering is?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 he answered; \u2018what can it be? My dead\n      cousin was here, and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of\n      money down below, but no one told me what it was to shudder.\u2019 \u2018Then,\u2019 said\n      the king, \u2018you have saved the castle, and shall marry my daughter.\u2019 \u2018That\n      is all very well,\u2019 said he, \u2018but still I do not know what it is to\n      shudder!\u2019\n    \n\n      Then the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but howsoever\n      much the young king loved his wife, and however happy he was, he still\n      said always: \u2018If I could but shudder\u2014if I could but shudder.\u2019 And\n      this at last angered her. Her waiting-maid said: \u2018I will find a cure for\n      him; he shall soon learn what it is to shudder.\u2019 She went out to the\n      stream which flowed through the garden, and had a whole bucketful of\n      gudgeons brought to her. At night when the young king was sleeping, his\n      wife was to draw the clothes off him and empty the bucket full of cold\n      water with the gudgeons in it over him, so that the little fishes would\n      sprawl about him. Then he woke up and cried: \u2018Oh, what makes me shudder\n      so?\u2014what makes me shudder so, dear wife? Ah! now I know what it is\n      to shudder!\u2019\n    ",
