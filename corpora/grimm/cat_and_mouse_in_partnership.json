    "name": "Grimm - Cat And Mouse In Partnership",
    "body": "\n      A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much\n      to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at\n      length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.\n      \u2018But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer from\n      hunger,\u2019 said the cat; \u2018and you, little mouse, cannot venture everywhere,\n      or you will be caught in a trap some day.\u2019 The good advice was followed,\n      and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where to put it. At\n      length, after much consideration, the cat said: \u2018I know no place where it\n      will be better stored up than in the church, for no one dares take\n      anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar, and not touch\n      it until we are really in need of it.\u2019 So the pot was placed in safety,\n      but it was not long before the cat had a great yearning for it, and said\n      to the mouse: \u2018I want to tell you something, little mouse; my cousin has\n      brought a little son into the world, and has asked me to be godmother; he\n      is white with brown spots, and I am to hold him over the font at the\n      christening. Let me go out today, and you look after the house by\n      yourself.\u2019 \u2018Yes, yes,\u2019 answered the mouse, \u2018by all means go, and if you\n      get anything very good to eat, think of me. I should like a drop of sweet\n      red christening wine myself.\u2019 All this, however, was untrue; the cat had\n      no cousin, and had not been asked to be godmother. She went straight to\n      the church, stole to the pot of fat, began to lick at it, and licked the\n      top of the fat off. Then she took a walk upon the roofs of the town,\n      looked out for opportunities, and then stretched herself in the sun, and\n      licked her lips whenever she thought of the pot of fat, and not until it\n      was evening did she return home. \u2018Well, here you are again,\u2019 said the\n      mouse, \u2018no doubt you have had a merry day.\u2019 \u2018All went off well,\u2019 answered\n      the cat. \u2018What name did they give the child?\u2019 \u2018Top off!\u2019 said the cat\n      quite coolly. \u2018Top off!\u2019 cried the mouse, \u2018that is a very odd and uncommon\n      name, is it a usual one in your family?\u2019 \u2018What does that matter,\u2019 said the\n      cat, \u2018it is no worse than Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.\u2019\n    \n\n      Before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said to the\n      mouse: \u2018You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for a day\n      alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a white\n      ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.\u2019 The good mouse consented, but the\n      cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured half the pot\n      of fat. \u2018Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to oneself,\u2019 said\n      she, and was quite satisfied with her day\u2019s work. When she went home the\n      mouse inquired: \u2018And what was the child christened?\u2019 \u2018Half-done,\u2019 answered\n      the cat. \u2018Half-done! What are you saying? I never heard the name in my\n      life, I\u2019ll wager anything it is not in the calendar!\u2019\n    \n\n      The cat\u2019s mouth soon began to water for some more licking. \u2018All good\n      things go in threes,\u2019 said she, \u2018I am asked to stand godmother again. The\n      child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that exception, it\n      has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only happens once\n      every few years, you will let me go, won\u2019t you?\u2019 \u2018Top-off! Half-done!\u2019\n      answered the mouse, \u2018they are such odd names, they make me very\n      thoughtful.\u2019 \u2018You sit at home,\u2019 said the cat, \u2018in your dark-grey fur coat\n      and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that\u2019s because you do not go\n      out in the daytime.\u2019 During the cat\u2019s absence the mouse cleaned the house,\n      and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely emptied the pot of fat.\n      \u2018When everything is eaten up one has some peace,\u2019 said she to herself, and\n      well filled and fat she did not return home till night. The mouse at once\n      asked what name had been given to the third child. \u2018It will not please you\n      more than the others,\u2019 said the cat. \u2018He is called All-gone.\u2019 \u2018All-gone,\u2019\n      cried the mouse \u2018that is the most suspicious name of all! I have never\n      seen it in print. All-gone; what can that mean?\u2019 and she shook her head,\n      curled herself up, and lay down to sleep.\n    \n\n      From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but when the\n      winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found outside, the\n      mouse thought of their provision, and said: \u2018Come, cat, we will go to our\n      pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves\u2014we shall enjoy\n      that.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 answered the cat, \u2018you will enjoy it as much as you would\n      enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the window.\u2019 They set\n      out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of fat certainly was\n      still in its place, but it was empty. \u2018Alas!\u2019 said the mouse, \u2018now I see\n      what has happened, now it comes to light! You are a true friend! You have\n      devoured all when you were standing godmother. First top off, then\n      half-done, then\u2014\u2019 \u2018Will you hold your tongue,\u2019 cried the cat, \u2018one\n      word more, and I will eat you too.\u2019 \u2018All-gone\u2019 was already on the poor\n      mouse\u2019s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang on her,\n      seized her, and swallowed her down. Verily, that is the way of the world.\n    ",
