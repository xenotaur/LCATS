    "body": "\n      There was once a king\u2019s son who had a bride whom he loved very much. And\n      when he was sitting beside her and very happy, news came that his father\n      lay sick unto death, and desired to see him once again before his end.\n      Then he said to his beloved: \u2018I must now go and leave you, I give you a\n      ring as a remembrance of me. When I am king, I will return and fetch you.\u2019\n      So he rode away, and when he reached his father, the latter was\n      dangerously ill, and near his death. He said to him: \u2018Dear son, I wished\n      to see you once again before my end, promise me to marry as I wish,\u2019 and\n      he named a certain king\u2019s daughter who was to be his wife. The son was in\n      such trouble that he did not think what he was doing, and said: \u2018Yes, dear\n      father, your will shall be done,\u2019 and thereupon the king shut his eyes,\n      and died.\n    \n\n      When therefore the son had been proclaimed king, and the time of mourning\n      was over, he was forced to keep the promise which he had given his father,\n      and caused the king\u2019s daughter to be asked in marriage, and she was\n      promised to him. His first betrothed heard of this, and fretted so much\n      about his faithfulness that she nearly died. Then her father said to her:\n      \u2018Dearest child, why are you so sad? You shall have whatsoever you will.\u2019\n      She thought for a moment and said: \u2018Dear father, I wish for eleven girls\n      exactly like myself in face, figure, and size.\u2019 The father said: \u2018If it be\n      possible, your desire shall be fulfilled,\u2019 and he caused a search to be\n      made in his whole kingdom, until eleven young maidens were found who\n      exactly resembled his daughter in face, figure, and size.\n    \n\n      When they came to the king\u2019s daughter, she had twelve suits of huntsmen\u2019s\n      clothes made, all alike, and the eleven maidens had to put on the\n      huntsmen\u2019s clothes, and she herself put on the twelfth suit. Thereupon she\n      took her leave of her father, and rode away with them, and rode to the\n      court of her former betrothed, whom she loved so dearly. Then she asked if\n      he required any huntsmen, and if he would take all of them into his\n      service. The king looked at her and did not know her, but as they were\n      such handsome fellows, he said: \u2018Yes,\u2019 and that he would willingly take\n      them, and now they were the king\u2019s twelve huntsmen.\n    \n\n      The king, however, had a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew all\n      concealed and secret things. It came to pass that one evening he said to\n      the king: \u2018You think you have twelve huntsmen?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said the king,\n      \u2018they are twelve huntsmen.\u2019 The lion continued: \u2018You are mistaken, they\n      are twelve girls.\u2019 The king said: \u2018That cannot be true! How will you prove\n      that to me?\u2019 \u2018Oh, just let some peas be strewn in the ante-chamber,\u2019\n      answered the lion, \u2018and then you will soon see. Men have a firm step, and\n      when they walk over peas none of them stir, but girls trip and skip, and\n      drag their feet, and the peas roll about.\u2019 The king was well pleased with\n      the counsel, and caused the peas to be strewn.\n    \n\n      There was, however, a servant of the king\u2019s who favoured the huntsmen, and\n      when he heard that they were going to be put to this test he went to them\n      and repeated everything, and said: \u2018The lion wants to make the king\n      believe that you are girls.\u2019 Then the king\u2019s daughter thanked him, and\n      said to her maidens: \u2018Show some strength, and step firmly on the peas.\u2019 So\n      next morning when the king had the twelve huntsmen called before him, and\n      they came into the ante-chamber where the peas were lying, they stepped so\n      firmly on them, and had such a strong, sure walk, that not one of the peas\n      either rolled or stirred. Then they went away again, and the king said to\n      the lion: \u2018You have lied to me, they walk just like men.\u2019 The lion said:\n      \u2018They have been informed that they were going to be put to the test, and\n      have assumed some strength. Just let twelve spinning-wheels be brought\n      into the ante-chamber, and they will go to them and be pleased with them,\n      and that is what no man would do.\u2019 The king liked the advice, and had the\n      spinning-wheels placed in the ante-chamber.\n    \n\n      But the servant, who was well disposed to the huntsmen, went to them, and\n      disclosed the project. So when they were alone the king\u2019s daughter said to\n      her eleven girls: \u2018Show some constraint, and do not look round at the\n      spinning-wheels.\u2019 And next morning when the king had his twelve huntsmen\n      summoned, they went through the ante-chamber, and never once looked at the\n      spinning-wheels. Then the king again said to the lion: \u2018You have deceived\n      me, they are men, for they have not looked at the spinning-wheels.\u2019 The\n      lion replied: \u2018They have restrained themselves.\u2019 The king, however, would\n      no longer believe the lion.\n    \n\n      The twelve huntsmen always followed the king to the chase, and his liking\n      for them continually increased. Now it came to pass that once when they\n      were out hunting, news came that the king\u2019s bride was approaching. When\n      the true bride heard that, it hurt her so much that her heart was almost\n      broken, and she fell fainting to the ground. The king thought something\n      had happened to his dear huntsman, ran up to him, wanted to help him, and\n      drew his glove off. Then he saw the ring which he had given to his first\n      bride, and when he looked in her face he recognized her. Then his heart\n      was so touched that he kissed her, and when she opened her eyes he said:\n      \u2018You are mine, and I am yours, and no one in the world can alter that.\u2019 He\n      sent a messenger to the other bride, and entreated her to return to her\n      own kingdom, for he had a wife already, and someone who had just found an\n      old key did not require a new one. Thereupon the wedding was celebrated,\n      and the lion was again taken into favour, because, after all, he had told\n      the truth.\n    ",
