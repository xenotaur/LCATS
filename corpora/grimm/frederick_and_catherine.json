    "name": "Grimm - Frederick And Catherine",
    "body": "\n      There was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was\n      Catherine, and they had not long been married. One day Frederick said.\n      \u2018Kate! I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be\n      hungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.\u2019\n      \u2018Very well,\u2019 said she, \u2018it shall all be ready.\u2019 When dinner-time drew\n      nigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and put\n      it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look brown, and to crackle\n      in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it: then she\n      said to herself, \u2018The steak is almost ready, I may as well go to the\n      cellar for the ale.\u2019 So she left the pan on the fire and took a large jug\n      and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. The beer ran into the\n      jug and Catherine stood looking on. At last it popped into her head, \u2018The\n      dog is not shut up\u2014he may be running away with the steak; that\u2019s\n      well thought of.\u2019 So up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough the\n      rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth, and was making off with it.\n    \n\n      Away ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran\n      faster than she, and stuck close to the steak. \u2018It\u2019s all gone, and \u201cwhat\n      can\u2019t be cured must be endured\u201d,\u2019 said Catherine. So she turned round; and\n      as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely to cool\n      herself.\n    \n\n      Now all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not turned\n      the cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till the\n      cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had\n      happened. \u2018My stars!\u2019 said she, \u2018what shall I do to keep Frederick from\n      seeing all this slopping about?\u2019 So she thought a while; and at last\n      remembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair, and\n      that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale nicely.\n      \u2018What a lucky thing,\u2019 said she, \u2018that we kept that meal! we have now a\n      good use for it.\u2019 So away she went for it: but she managed to set it down\n      just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus all the ale\n      that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. \u2018Ah! well,\u2019 said\n      she, \u2018when one goes another may as well follow.\u2019 Then she strewed the meal\n      all about the cellar, and was quite pleased with her cleverness, and said,\n      \u2018How very neat and clean it looks!\u2019\n    \n\n      At noon Frederick came home. \u2018Now, wife,\u2019 cried he, \u2018what have you for\n      dinner?\u2019 \u2018O Frederick!\u2019 answered she, \u2018I was cooking you a steak; but\n      while I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while I\n      ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale with the\n      sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but the cellar is\n      now quite dry, and looks so clean!\u2019 \u2018Kate, Kate,\u2019 said he, \u2018how could you\n      do all this?\u2019 Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the ale to run, and\n      then spoil all the meal?\u2019 \u2018Why, Frederick,\u2019 said she, \u2018I did not know I\n      was doing wrong; you should have told me before.\u2019\n    \n\n      The husband thought to himself, \u2018If my wife manages matters thus, I must\n      look sharp myself.\u2019 Now he had a good deal of gold in the house: so he\n      said to Catherine, \u2018What pretty yellow buttons these are! I shall put them\n      into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you never go\n      near or meddle with them.\u2019 \u2018No, Frederick,\u2019 said she, \u2018that I never will.\u2019\n      As soon as he was gone, there came by some pedlars with earthenware plates\n      and dishes, and they asked her whether she would buy. \u2018Oh dear me, I\n      should like to buy very much, but I have no money: if you had any use for\n      yellow buttons, I might deal with you.\u2019 \u2018Yellow buttons!\u2019 said they: \u2018let\n      us have a look at them.\u2019 \u2018Go into the garden and dig where I tell you, and\n      you will find the yellow buttons: I dare not go myself.\u2019 So the rogues\n      went: and when they found what these yellow buttons were, they took them\n      all away, and left her plenty of plates and dishes. Then she set them all\n      about the house for a show: and when Frederick came back, he cried out,\n      \u2018Kate, what have you been doing?\u2019 \u2018See,\u2019 said she, \u2018I have bought all\n      these with your yellow buttons: but I did not touch them myself; the\n      pedlars went themselves and dug them up.\u2019 \u2018Wife, wife,\u2019 said Frederick,\n      \u2018what a pretty piece of work you have made! those yellow buttons were all\n      my money: how came you to do such a thing?\u2019 \u2018Why,\u2019 answered she, \u2018I did\n      not know there was any harm in it; you should have told me.\u2019\n    \n\n      Catherine stood musing for a while, and at last said to her husband, \u2018Hark\n      ye, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back: let us run after the\n      thieves.\u2019 \u2018Well, we will try,\u2019 answered he; \u2018but take some butter and\n      cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.\u2019 \u2018Very\n      well,\u2019 said she; and they set out: and as Frederick walked the fastest, he\n      left his wife some way behind. \u2018It does not matter,\u2019 thought she: \u2018when we\n      turn back, I shall be so much nearer home than he.\u2019\n    \n\n      Presently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there was\n      a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees on each side\n      as they passed. \u2018Ah, see now,\u2019 said she, \u2018how they have bruised and\n      wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.\u2019 So she took pity on\n      them, and made use of the butter to grease them all, so that the wheels\n      might not hurt them so much. While she was doing this kind office one of\n      her cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled down the hill. Catherine\n      looked, but could not see where it had gone; so she said, \u2018Well, I suppose\n      the other will go the same way and find you; he has younger legs than I\n      have.\u2019 Then she rolled the other cheese after it; and away it went, nobody\n      knows where, down the hill. But she said she supposed that they knew the\n      road, and would follow her, and she could not stay there all day waiting\n      for them.\n    \n\n      At last she overtook Frederick, who desired her to give him something to\n      eat. Then she gave him the dry bread. \u2018Where are the butter and cheese?\u2019\n      said he. \u2018Oh!\u2019 answered she, \u2018I used the butter to grease those poor trees\n      that the wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran away so I sent the\n      other after it to find it, and I suppose they are both on the road\n      together somewhere.\u2019 \u2018What a goose you are to do such silly things!\u2019 said\n      the husband. \u2018How can you say so?\u2019 said she; \u2018I am sure you never told me\n      not.\u2019\n    \n\n      They ate the dry bread together; and Frederick said, \u2018Kate, I hope you\n      locked the door safe when you came away.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 answered she, \u2018you did not\n      tell me.\u2019 \u2018Then go home, and do it now before we go any farther,\u2019 said\n      Frederick, \u2018and bring with you something to eat.\u2019\n    \n\n      Catherine did as he told her, and thought to herself by the way,\n      \u2018Frederick wants something to eat; but I don\u2019t think he is very fond of\n      butter and cheese: I\u2019ll bring him a bag of fine nuts, and the vinegar, for\n      I have often seen him take some.\u2019\n    \n\n      When she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door she\n      took off the hinges, and said, \u2018Frederick told me to lock the door, but\n      surely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.\u2019 So she took her\n      time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she cried out, \u2018There,\n      Frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch it as carefully as you\n      please.\u2019 \u2018Alas! alas!\u2019 said he, \u2018what a clever wife I have! I sent you to\n      make the house fast, and you take the door away, so that everybody may go\n      in and out as they please\u2014however, as you have brought the door, you\n      shall carry it about with you for your pains.\u2019 \u2018Very well,\u2019 answered she,\n      \u2018I\u2019ll carry the door; but I\u2019ll not carry the nuts and vinegar bottle also\u2014that\n      would be too much of a load; so if you please, I\u2019ll fasten them to the\n      door.\u2019\n    \n\n      Frederick of course made no objection to that plan, and they set off into\n      the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them: and when\n      it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there.\n      Scarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very rogues they\n      were looking for. They were in truth great rascals, and belonged to that\n      class of people who find things before they are lost; they were tired; so\n      they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where Frederick and\n      Catherine were. Frederick slipped down on the other side, and picked up\n      some stones. Then he climbed up again, and tried to hit the thieves on the\n      head with them: but they only said, \u2018It must be near morning, for the wind\n      shakes the fir-apples down.\u2019\n    \n\n      Catherine, who had the door on her shoulder, began to be very tired; but\n      she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so she said\n      softly, \u2018Frederick, I must let the nuts go.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 answered he, \u2018not now,\n      they will discover us.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t help that: they must go.\u2019 \u2018Well, then,\n      make haste and throw them down, if you will.\u2019 Then away rattled the nuts\n      down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried, \u2018Bless me, it is\n      hailing.\u2019\n    \n\n      A little while after, Catherine thought the door was still very heavy: so\n      she whispered to Frederick, \u2018I must throw the vinegar down.\u2019 \u2018Pray don\u2019t,\u2019\n      answered he, \u2018it will discover us.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t help that,\u2019 said she, \u2018go it\n      must.\u2019 So she poured all the vinegar down; and the thieves said, \u2018What a\n      heavy dew there is!\u2019\n    \n\n      At last it popped into Catherine\u2019s head that it was the door itself that\n      was so heavy all the time: so she whispered, \u2018Frederick, I must throw the\n      door down soon.\u2019 But he begged and prayed her not to do so, for he was\n      sure it would betray them. \u2018Here goes, however,\u2019 said she: and down went\n      the door with such a clatter upon the thieves, that they cried out\n      \u2018Murder!\u2019 and not knowing what was coming, ran away as fast as they could,\n      and left all the gold. So when Frederick and Catherine came down, there\n      they found all their money safe and sound.\n    ",
