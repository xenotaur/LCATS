    "body": "\n      There was once a king, whose queen had hair of the purest gold, and was so\n      beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face of the\n      earth. But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her end\n      drew near she called the king to her and said, \u2018Promise me that you will\n      never marry again, unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful as I\n      am, and who has golden hair like mine.\u2019 Then when the king in his grief\n      promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died. But the king was not\n      to be comforted, and for a long time never thought of taking another wife.\n      At last, however, his wise men said, \u2018this will not do; the king must\n      marry again, that we may have a queen.\u2019 So messengers were sent far and\n      wide, to seek for a bride as beautiful as the late queen. But there was no\n      princess in the world so beautiful; and if there had been, still there was\n      not one to be found who had golden hair. So the messengers came home, and\n      had had all their trouble for nothing.\n    \n\n      Now the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and\n      had the same golden hair. And when she was grown up, the king looked at\n      her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he said to his\n      courtiers, \u2018May I not marry my daughter? She is the very image of my dead\n      wife: unless I have her, I shall not find any bride upon the whole earth,\n      and you say there must be a queen.\u2019 When the courtiers heard this they\n      were shocked, and said, \u2018Heaven forbid that a father should marry his\n      daughter! Out of so great a sin no good can come.\u2019 And his daughter was\n      also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts; so she\n      said to him, \u2018Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses: one must be\n      of gold, like the sun; another must be of shining silver, like the moon;\n      and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this, I want a mantle\n      of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to which every beast in\n      the kingdom must give a part of his skin.\u2019 And thus she thought he would\n      think of the matter no more. But the king made the most skilful workmen in\n      his kingdom weave the three dresses: one golden, like the sun; another\n      silvery, like the moon; and a third sparkling, like the stars: and his\n      hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in his kingdom, and to take\n      the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a mantle of a thousand furs\n      was made.\n    \n\n      When all were ready, the king sent them to her; but she got up in the\n      night when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a golden ring,\n      a golden necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the three dresses\u2014of\n      the sun, the moon, and the stars\u2014up in a nutshell, and wrapped\n      herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur, and besmeared her face\n      and hands with soot. Then she threw herself upon Heaven for help in her\n      need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole night, till at last she\n      came to a large wood. As she was very tired, she sat herself down in the\n      hollow of a tree and soon fell asleep: and there she slept on till it was\n      midday.\n    \n\n      Now as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his dogs came\n      to the tree, and began to snuff about, and run round and round, and bark.\n      \u2018Look sharp!\u2019 said the king to the huntsmen, \u2018and see what sort of game\n      lies there.\u2019 And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and when they came back\n      again said, \u2018In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful beast, such as\n      we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand kinds of fur, but\n      there it lies fast asleep.\u2019 \u2018See,\u2019 said the king, \u2018if you can catch it\n      alive, and we will take it with us.\u2019 So the huntsmen took it up, and the\n      maiden awoke and was greatly frightened, and said, \u2018I am a poor child that\n      has neither father nor mother left; have pity on me and take me with you.\u2019\n      Then they said, \u2018Yes, Miss Cat-skin, you will do for the kitchen; you can\n      sweep up the ashes, and do things of that sort.\u2019 So they put her into the\n      coach, and took her home to the king\u2019s palace. Then they showed her a\n      little corner under the staircase, where no light of day ever peeped in,\n      and said, \u2018Cat-skin, you may lie and sleep there.\u2019 And she was sent into\n      the kitchen, and made to fetch wood and water, to blow the fire, pluck the\n      poultry, pick the herbs, sift the ashes, and do all the dirty work.\n    \n\n      Thus Cat-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully. \u2018Ah! pretty\n      princess!\u2019 thought she, \u2018what will now become of thee?\u2019 But it happened\n      one day that a feast was to be held in the king\u2019s castle, so she said to\n      the cook, \u2018May I go up a little while and see what is going on? I will\n      take care and stand behind the door.\u2019 And the cook said, \u2018Yes, you may go,\n      but be back again in half an hour\u2019s time, to rake out the ashes.\u2019 Then she\n      took her little lamp, and went into her cabin, and took off the fur skin,\n      and washed the soot from off her face and hands, so that her beauty shone\n      forth like the sun from behind the clouds. She next opened her nutshell,\n      and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sun, and so went to\n      the feast. Everyone made way for her, for nobody knew her, and they\n      thought she could be no less than a king\u2019s daughter. But the king came up\n      to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and he thought in his\n      heart, \u2018I never saw any one half so beautiful.\u2019\n    \n\n      When the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked round\n      for her, she was gone, no one knew wither. The guards that stood at the\n      castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one. The truth was, that\n      she had run into her little cabin, pulled off her dress, blackened her\n      face and hands, put on the fur-skin cloak, and was Cat-skin again. When\n      she went into the kitchen to her work, and began to rake the ashes, the\n      cook said, \u2018Let that alone till the morning, and heat the king\u2019s soup; I\n      should like to run up now and give a peep: but take care you don\u2019t let a\n      hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of never eating again.\u2019\n    \n\n      As soon as the cook went away, Cat-skin heated the king\u2019s soup, and\n      toasted a slice of bread first, as nicely as ever she could; and when it\n      was ready, she went and looked in the cabin for her little golden ring,\n      and put it into the dish in which the soup was. When the dance was over,\n      the king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well,\n      that he thought he had never tasted any so good before. At the bottom he\n      saw a gold ring lying; and as he could not make out how it had got there,\n      he ordered the cook to be sent for. The cook was frightened when he heard\n      the order, and said to Cat-skin, \u2018You must have let a hair fall into the\n      soup; if it be so, you will have a good beating.\u2019 Then he went before the\n      king, and he asked him who had cooked the soup. \u2018I did,\u2019 answered the\n      cook. But the king said, \u2018That is not true; it was better done than you\n      could do it.\u2019 Then he answered, \u2018To tell the truth I did not cook it, but\n      Cat-skin did.\u2019 \u2018Then let Cat-skin come up,\u2019 said the king: and when she\n      came he said to her, \u2018Who are you?\u2019 \u2018I am a poor child,\u2019 said she, \u2018that\n      has lost both father and mother.\u2019 \u2018How came you in my palace?\u2019 asked he.\n      \u2018I am good for nothing,\u2019 said she, \u2018but to be scullion-girl, and to have\n      boots and shoes thrown at my head.\u2019 \u2018But how did you get the ring that was\n      in the soup?\u2019 asked the king. Then she would not own that she knew\n      anything about the ring; so the king sent her away again about her\n      business.\n    \n\n      After a time there was another feast, and Cat-skin asked the cook to let\n      her go up and see it as before. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said he, \u2018but come again in half an\n      hour, and cook the king the soup that he likes so much.\u2019 Then she ran to\n      her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her dress out which was\n      silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went in, looking like a\n      king\u2019s daughter, the king went up to her, and rejoiced at seeing her\n      again, and when the dance began he danced with her. After the dance was at\n      an end she managed to slip out, so slyly that the king did not see where\n      she was gone; but she sprang into her little cabin, and made herself into\n      Cat-skin again, and went into the kitchen to cook the soup. Whilst the\n      cook was above stairs, she got the golden necklace and dropped it into the\n      soup; then it was brought to the king, who ate it, and it pleased him as\n      well as before; so he sent for the cook, who was again forced to tell him\n      that Cat-skin had cooked it. Cat-skin was brought again before the king,\n      but she still told him that she was only fit to have boots and shoes\n      thrown at her head.\n    \n\n      But when the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the third time,\n      it happened just the same as before. \u2018You must be a witch, Cat-skin,\u2019 said\n      the cook; \u2018for you always put something into your soup, so that it pleases\n      the king better than mine.\u2019 However, he let her go up as before. Then she\n      put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and went into the\n      ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and thought she had\n      never looked so beautiful as she did then. So whilst he was dancing with\n      her, he put a gold ring on her finger without her seeing it, and ordered\n      that the dance should be kept up a long time. When it was at an end, he\n      would have held her fast by the hand, but she slipped away, and sprang so\n      quickly through the crowd that he lost sight of her: and she ran as fast\n      as she could into her little cabin under the stairs. But this time she\n      kept away too long, and stayed beyond the half-hour; so she had not time\n      to take off her fine dress, and threw her fur mantle over it, and in her\n      haste did not blacken herself all over with soot, but left one of her\n      fingers white.\n    \n\n      Then she ran into the kitchen, and cooked the king\u2019s soup; and as soon as\n      the cook was gone, she put the golden brooch into the dish. When the king\n      got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and soon\n      saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst they were\n      dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and when she\n      wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off a little\n      on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.\n    \n\n      Then he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and\n      beautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so she\n      washed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the most\n      beautiful princess upon the face of the earth. But the king said, \u2018You are\n      my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each other.\u2019 And\n      the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever was heard of\n      or seen in that country, or indeed in any other.\n    ",
