    "body": "\n      There was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had served the\n      king faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer\n      because of the many wounds which he had received. The king said to him:\n      \u2018You may return to your home, I need you no longer, and you will not\n      receive any more money, for he only receives wages who renders me service\n      for them.\u2019 Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living, went away\n      greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the evening he\n      entered a forest. When darkness came on, he saw a light, which he went up\n      to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch. \u2018Do give me one night\u2019s\n      lodging, and a little to eat and drink,\u2019 said he to her, \u2018or I shall\n      starve.\u2019 \u2018Oho!\u2019 she answered, \u2018who gives anything to a run-away soldier?\n      Yet will I be compassionate, and take you in, if you will do what I wish.\u2019\n      \u2018What do you wish?\u2019 said the soldier. \u2018That you should dig all round my\n      garden for me, tomorrow.\u2019 The soldier consented, and next day laboured\n      with all his strength, but could not finish it by the evening. \u2018I see well\n      enough,\u2019 said the witch, \u2018that you can do no more today, but I will keep\n      you yet another night, in payment for which you must tomorrow chop me a\n      load of wood, and chop it small.\u2019 The soldier spent the whole day in doing\n      it, and in the evening the witch proposed that he should stay one night\n      more. \u2018Tomorrow, you shall only do me a very trifling piece of work.\n      Behind my house, there is an old dry well, into which my light has fallen,\n      it burns blue, and never goes out, and you shall bring it up again.\u2019 Next\n      day the old woman took him to the well, and let him down in a basket. He\n      found the blue light, and made her a signal to draw him up again. She did\n      draw him up, but when he came near the edge, she stretched down her hand\n      and wanted to take the blue light away from him. \u2018No,\u2019 said he, perceiving\n      her evil intention, \u2018I will not give you the light until I am standing\n      with both feet upon the ground.\u2019 The witch fell into a passion, let him\n      fall again into the well, and went away.\n    \n\n      The poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the blue\n      light went on burning, but of what use was that to him? He saw very well\n      that he could not escape death. He sat for a while very sorrowfully, then\n      suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which was still\n      half full. \u2018This shall be my last pleasure,\u2019 thought he, pulled it out,\n      lit it at the blue light and began to smoke. When the smoke had circled\n      about the cavern, suddenly a little black dwarf stood before him, and\n      said: \u2018Lord, what are your commands?\u2019 \u2018What my commands are?\u2019 replied the\n      soldier, quite astonished. \u2018I must do everything you bid me,\u2019 said the\n      little man. \u2018Good,\u2019 said the soldier; \u2018then in the first place help me out\n      of this well.\u2019 The little man took him by the hand, and led him through an\n      underground passage, but he did not forget to take the blue light with\n      him. On the way the dwarf showed him the treasures which the witch had\n      collected and hidden there, and the soldier took as much gold as he could\n      carry. When he was above, he said to the little man: \u2018Now go and bind the\n      old witch, and carry her before the judge.\u2019 In a short time she came by\n      like the wind, riding on a wild tom-cat and screaming frightfully. Nor was\n      it long before the little man reappeared. \u2018It is all done,\u2019 said he, \u2018and\n      the witch is already hanging on the gallows. What further commands has my\n      lord?\u2019 inquired the dwarf. \u2018At this moment, none,\u2019 answered the soldier;\n      \u2018you can return home, only be at hand immediately, if I summon you.\u2019\n      \u2018Nothing more is needed than that you should light your pipe at the blue\n      light, and I will appear before you at once.\u2019 Thereupon he vanished from\n      his sight.\n    \n\n      The soldier returned to the town from which he came. He went to the best\n      inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord furnish\n      him a room as handsome as possible. When it was ready and the soldier had\n      taken possession of it, he summoned the little black manikin and said: \u2018I\n      have served the king faithfully, but he has dismissed me, and left me to\n      hunger, and now I want to take my revenge.\u2019 \u2018What am I to do?\u2019 asked the\n      little man. \u2018Late at night, when the king\u2019s daughter is in bed, bring her\n      here in her sleep, she shall do servant\u2019s work for me.\u2019 The manikin said:\n      \u2018That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very dangerous thing for you,\n      for if it is discovered, you will fare ill.\u2019 When twelve o\u2019clock had\n      struck, the door sprang open, and the manikin carried in the princess.\n      \u2018Aha! are you there?\u2019 cried the soldier, \u2018get to your work at once! Fetch\n      the broom and sweep the chamber.\u2019 When she had done this, he ordered her\n      to come to his chair, and then he stretched out his feet and said: \u2018Pull\n      off my boots,\u2019 and then he threw them in her face, and made her pick them\n      up again, and clean and brighten them. She, however, did everything he\n      bade her, without opposition, silently and with half-shut eyes. When the\n      first cock crowed, the manikin carried her back to the royal palace, and\n      laid her in her bed.\n    \n\n      Next morning when the princess arose she went to her father, and told him\n      that she had had a very strange dream. \u2018I was carried through the streets\n      with the rapidity of lightning,\u2019 said she, \u2018and taken into a soldier\u2019s\n      room, and I had to wait upon him like a servant, sweep his room, clean his\n      boots, and do all kinds of menial work. It was only a dream, and yet I am\n      just as tired as if I really had done everything.\u2019 \u2018The dream may have\n      been true,\u2019 said the king. \u2018I will give you a piece of advice. Fill your\n      pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in the pocket, and then if you\n      are carried away again, they will fall out and leave a track in the\n      streets.\u2019 But unseen by the king, the manikin was standing beside him when\n      he said that, and heard all. At night when the sleeping princess was again\n      carried through the streets, some peas certainly did fall out of her\n      pocket, but they made no track, for the crafty manikin had just before\n      scattered peas in every street there was. And again the princess was\n      compelled to do servant\u2019s work until cock-crow.\n    \n\n      Next morning the king sent his people out to seek the track, but it was\n      all in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting, picking up\n      peas, and saying: \u2018It must have rained peas, last night.\u2019 \u2018We must think\n      of something else,\u2019 said the king; \u2018keep your shoes on when you go to bed,\n      and before you come back from the place where you are taken, hide one of\n      them there, I will soon contrive to find it.\u2019 The black manikin heard this\n      plot, and at night when the soldier again ordered him to bring the\n      princess, revealed it to him, and told him that he knew of no expedient to\n      counteract this stratagem, and that if the shoe were found in the\n      soldier\u2019s house it would go badly with him. \u2018Do what I bid you,\u2019 replied\n      the soldier, and again this third night the princess was obliged to work\n      like a servant, but before she went away, she hid her shoe under the bed.\n    \n\n      Next morning the king had the entire town searched for his daughter\u2019s\n      shoe. It was found at the soldier\u2019s, and the soldier himself, who at the\n      entreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate, was soon brought back,\n      and thrown into prison. In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable\n      things he had, the blue light and the gold, and had only one ducat in his\n      pocket. And now loaded with chains, he was standing at the window of his\n      dungeon, when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by. The\n      soldier tapped at the pane of glass, and when this man came up, said to\n      him: \u2018Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I have left lying in the\n      inn, and I will give you a ducat for doing it.\u2019 His comrade ran thither\n      and brought him what he wanted. As soon as the soldier was alone again, he\n      lighted his pipe and summoned the black manikin. \u2018Have no fear,\u2019 said the\n      latter to his master. \u2018Go wheresoever they take you, and let them do what\n      they will, only take the blue light with you.\u2019 Next day the soldier was\n      tried, and though he had done nothing wicked, the judge condemned him to\n      death. When he was led forth to die, he begged a last favour of the king.\n      \u2018What is it?\u2019 asked the king. \u2018That I may smoke one more pipe on my way.\u2019\n      \u2018You may smoke three,\u2019 answered the king, \u2018but do not imagine that I will\n      spare your life.\u2019 Then the soldier pulled out his pipe and lighted it at\n      the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths of smoke had ascended, the\n      manikin was there with a small cudgel in his hand, and said: \u2018What does my\n      lord command?\u2019 \u2018Strike down to earth that false judge there, and his\n      constable, and spare not the king who has treated me so ill.\u2019 Then the\n      manikin fell on them like lightning, darting this way and that way, and\n      whosoever was so much as touched by his cudgel fell to earth, and did not\n      venture to stir again. The king was terrified; he threw himself on the\n      soldier\u2019s mercy, and merely to be allowed to live at all, gave him his\n      kingdom for his own, and his daughter to wife.\n    ",
