    "body": "\n      It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to\n      herself: \u2018He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the\n      world,\u2019 she spoke to him in a friendly way. \u2018Good day, dear Mr Fox, how\n      are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard times?\u2019\n      The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from head to\n      foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give any answer or\n      not. At last he said: \u2018Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you piebald fool,\n      you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have you the cheek\n      to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How many arts do you\n      understand?\u2019 \u2018I understand but one,\u2019 replied the cat, modestly. \u2018What art\n      is that?\u2019 asked the fox. \u2018When the hounds are following me, I can spring\n      into a tree and save myself.\u2019 \u2018Is that all?\u2019 said the fox. \u2018I am master of\n      a hundred arts, and have into the bargain a sackful of cunning. You make\n      me sorry for you; come with me, I will teach you how people get away from\n      the hounds.\u2019 Just then came a hunter with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly\n      up a tree, and sat down at the top of it, where the branches and foliage\n      quite concealed her. \u2018Open your sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,\u2019 cried the\n      cat to him, but the dogs had already seized him, and were holding him\n      fast. \u2018Ah, Mr Fox,\u2019 cried the cat. \u2018You with your hundred arts are left in\n      the lurch! Had you been able to climb like me, you would not have lost\n      your life.\u2019\n    ",
