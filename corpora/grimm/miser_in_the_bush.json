    "name": "Grimm - the Miser In the Bush",
    "body": "\n      A farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for him\n      three years, without having been paid any wages. At last it came into the\n      man\u2019s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer; so he went\n      to his master, and said, \u2018I have worked hard for you a long time, I will\n      trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my trouble.\u2019 The farmer\n      was a sad miser, and knew that his man was very simple-hearted; so he took\n      out threepence, and gave him for every year\u2019s service a penny. The poor\n      fellow thought it was a great deal of money to have, and said to himself,\n      \u2018Why should I work hard, and live here on bad fare any longer? I can now\n      travel into the wide world, and make myself merry.\u2019 With that he put his\n      money into his purse, and set out, roaming over hill and valley.\n    \n\n      As he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little dwarf\n      met him, and asked him what made him so merry. \u2018Why, what should make me\n      down-hearted?\u2019 said he; \u2018I am sound in health and rich in purse, what\n      should I care for? I have saved up my three years\u2019 earnings and have it\n      all safe in my pocket.\u2019 \u2018How much may it come to?\u2019 said the little man.\n      \u2018Full threepence,\u2019 replied the countryman. \u2018I wish you would give them to\n      me,\u2019 said the other; \u2018I am very poor.\u2019 Then the man pitied him, and gave\n      him all he had; and the little dwarf said in return, \u2018As you have such a\n      kind honest heart, I will grant you three wishes\u2014one for every\n      penny; so choose whatever you like.\u2019 Then the countryman rejoiced at his\n      good luck, and said, \u2018I like many things better than money: first, I will\n      have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly, a fiddle\n      that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and thirdly, I\n      should like that everyone should grant what I ask.\u2019 The dwarf said he\n      should have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle, and went\n      his way.\n    \n\n      Our honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before, he\n      was now ten times more so. He had not gone far before he met an old miser:\n      close by them stood a tree, and on the topmost twig sat a thrush singing\n      away most joyfully. \u2018Oh, what a pretty bird!\u2019 said the miser; \u2018I would\n      give a great deal of money to have such a one.\u2019 \u2018If that\u2019s all,\u2019 said the\n      countryman, \u2018I will soon bring it down.\u2019 Then he took up his bow, and down\n      fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree. The miser crept\n      into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into the middle, his\n      companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the miser began to dance\n      and spring about, capering higher and higher in the air. The thorns soon\n      began to tear his clothes till they all hung in rags about him, and he\n      himself was all scratched and wounded, so that the blood ran down. \u2018Oh,\n      for heaven\u2019s sake!\u2019 cried the miser, \u2018Master! master! pray let the fiddle\n      alone. What have I done to deserve this?\u2019 \u2018Thou hast shaved many a poor\n      soul close enough,\u2019 said the other; \u2018thou art only meeting thy reward\u2019: so\n      he played up another tune. Then the miser began to beg and promise, and\n      offered money for his liberty; but he did not come up to the musician\u2019s\n      price for some time, and he danced him along brisker and brisker, and the\n      miser bid higher and higher, till at last he offered a round hundred of\n      florins that he had in his purse, and had just gained by cheating some\n      poor fellow. When the countryman saw so much money, he said, \u2018I will agree\n      to your proposal.\u2019 So he took the purse, put up his fiddle, and travelled\n      on very pleased with his bargain.\n    \n\n      Meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous\n      plight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve his\n      late companion some trick. At last he went to the judge, and complained\n      that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him into the\n      bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his back and a\n      fiddle hung round his neck. Then the judge sent out his officers to bring\n      up the accused wherever they should find him; and he was soon caught and\n      brought up to be tried.\n    \n\n      The miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of his\n      money. \u2018No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you.\u2019 said the\n      countryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the matter\n      short by ordering him off to the gallows.\n    \n\n      So away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, \u2018My Lord\n      Judge, grant me one last request.\u2019 \u2018Anything but thy life,\u2019 replied the\n      other. \u2018No,\u2019 said he, \u2018I do not ask my life; only to let me play upon my\n      fiddle for the last time.\u2019 The miser cried out, \u2018Oh, no! no! for heaven\u2019s\n      sake don\u2019t listen to him! don\u2019t listen to him!\u2019 But the judge said, \u2018It is\n      only this once, he will soon have done.\u2019 The fact was, he could not refuse\n      the request, on account of the dwarf\u2019s third gift.\n    \n\n      Then the miser said, \u2018Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity\u2019s sake.\u2019 But\n      the countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first\n      note judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering, and no\n      one could hold the miser. At the second note the hangman let his prisoner\n      go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first bar of the\n      tune, all were dancing together\u2014judge, court, and miser, and all the\n      people who had followed to look on. At first the thing was merry and\n      pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a while, and there seemed to be\n      no end of playing or dancing, they began to cry out, and beg him to leave\n      off; but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreaties, till the\n      judge not only gave him his life, but promised to return him the hundred\n      florins.\n    \n\n      Then he called to the miser, and said, \u2018Tell us now, you vagabond, where\n      you got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,\u2019 \u2018I stole\n      it,\u2019 said the miser in the presence of all the people; \u2018I acknowledge that\n      I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.\u2019 Then the countryman stopped\n      his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at the gallows.\n    ",
