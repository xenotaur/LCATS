    "name": "Grimm - the King Of the Golden Mountain",
    "body": "\n      There was once a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very\n      young, and barely able to run alone. He had two richly laden ships then\n      making a voyage upon the seas, in which he had embarked all his wealth, in\n      the hope of making great gains, when the news came that both were lost.\n      Thus from being a rich man he became all at once so very poor that nothing\n      was left to him but one small plot of land; and there he often went in an\n      evening to take his walk, and ease his mind of a little of his trouble.\n    \n\n      One day, as he was roaming along in a brown study, thinking with no great\n      comfort on what he had been and what he now was, and was like to be, all\n      on a sudden there stood before him a little, rough-looking, black dwarf.\n      \u2018Prithee, friend, why so sorrowful?\u2019 said he to the merchant; \u2018what is it\n      you take so deeply to heart?\u2019 \u2018If you would do me any good I would\n      willingly tell you,\u2019 said the merchant. \u2018Who knows but I may?\u2019 said the\n      little man: \u2018tell me what ails you, and perhaps you will find I may be of\n      some use.\u2019 Then the merchant told him how all his wealth was gone to the\n      bottom of the sea, and how he had nothing left but that little plot of\n      land. \u2018Oh, trouble not yourself about that,\u2019 said the dwarf; \u2018only\n      undertake to bring me here, twelve years hence, whatever meets you first\n      on your going home, and I will give you as much as you please.\u2019 The\n      merchant thought this was no great thing to ask; that it would most likely\n      be his dog or his cat, or something of that sort, but forgot his little\n      boy Heinel; so he agreed to the bargain, and signed and sealed the bond to\n      do what was asked of him.\n    \n\n      But as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him that he\n      crept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked up in his\n      face and laughed. Then the father started, trembling with fear and horror,\n      and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do; but as no gold was\n      come, he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a joke that the\n      dwarf was playing him, and that, at any rate, when the money came, he\n      should see the bearer, and would not take it in.\n    \n\n      About a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumber-room to look for\n      some old iron, that he might sell it and raise a little money; and there,\n      instead of his iron, he saw a large pile of gold lying on the floor. At\n      the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about his son, went\n      into trade again, and became a richer merchant than before.\n    \n\n      Meantime little Heinel grew up, and as the end of the twelve years drew\n      near the merchant began to call to mind his bond, and became very sad and\n      thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon his face. The boy\n      one day asked what was the matter, but his father would not tell for some\n      time; at last, however, he said that he had, without knowing it, sold him\n      for gold to a little, ugly-looking, black dwarf, and that the twelve years\n      were coming round when he must keep his word. Then Heinel said, \u2018Father,\n      give yourself very little trouble about that; I shall be too much for the\n      little man.\u2019\n    \n\n      When the time came, the father and son went out together to the place\n      agreed upon: and the son drew a circle on the ground, and set himself and\n      his father in the middle of it. The little black dwarf soon came, and\n      walked round and round about the circle, but could not find any way to get\n      into it, and he either could not, or dared not, jump over it. At last the\n      boy said to him. \u2018Have you anything to say to us, my friend, or what do\n      you want?\u2019 Now Heinel had found a friend in a good fairy, that was fond of\n      him, and had told him what to do; for this fairy knew what good luck was\n      in store for him. \u2018Have you brought me what you said you would?\u2019 said the\n      dwarf to the merchant. The old man held his tongue, but Heinel said again,\n      \u2018What do you want here?\u2019 The dwarf said, \u2018I come to talk with your father,\n      not with you.\u2019 \u2018You have cheated and taken in my father,\u2019 said the son;\n      \u2018pray give him up his bond at once.\u2019 \u2018Fair and softly,\u2019 said the little\n      old man; \u2018right is right; I have paid my money, and your father has had\n      it, and spent it; so be so good as to let me have what I paid it for.\u2019\n      \u2018You must have my consent to that first,\u2019 said Heinel, \u2018so please to step\n      in here, and let us talk it over.\u2019 The old man grinned, and showed his\n      teeth, as if he should have been very glad to get into the circle if he\n      could. Then at last, after a long talk, they came to terms. Heinel agreed\n      that his father must give him up, and that so far the dwarf should have\n      his way: but, on the other hand, the fairy had told Heinel what fortune\n      was in store for him, if he followed his own course; and he did not choose\n      to be given up to his hump-backed friend, who seemed so anxious for his\n      company.\n    \n\n      So, to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter, it was settled that\n      Heinel should be put into an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard by;\n      that the father should push him off with his own hand, and that he should\n      thus be set adrift, and left to the bad or good luck of wind and weather.\n      Then he took leave of his father, and set himself in the boat, but before\n      it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one side low in the\n      water, so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost, and went home\n      very sorrowful, while the dwarf went his way, thinking that at any rate he\n      had had his revenge.\n    \n\n      The boat, however, did not sink, for the good fairy took care of her\n      friend, and soon raised the boat up again, and it went safely on. The\n      young man sat safe within, till at length it ran ashore upon an unknown\n      land. As he jumped upon the shore he saw before him a beautiful castle but\n      empty and dreary within, for it was enchanted. \u2018Here,\u2019 said he to himself,\n      \u2018must I find the prize the good fairy told me of.\u2019 So he once more\n      searched the whole palace through, till at last he found a white snake,\n      lying coiled up on a cushion in one of the chambers.\n    \n\n      Now the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very glad to\n      see him, and said, \u2018Are you at last come to set me free? Twelve long years\n      have I waited here for the fairy to bring you hither as she promised, for\n      you alone can save me. This night twelve men will come: their faces will\n      be black, and they will be dressed in chain armour. They will ask what you\n      do here, but give no answer; and let them do what they will\u2014beat,\n      whip, pinch, prick, or torment you\u2014bear all; only speak not a word,\n      and at twelve o\u2019clock they must go away. The second night twelve others\n      will come: and the third night twenty-four, who will even cut off your\n      head; but at the twelfth hour of that night their power is gone, and I\n      shall be free, and will come and bring you the Water of Life, and will\n      wash you with it, and bring you back to life and health.\u2019 And all came to\n      pass as she had said; Heinel bore all, and spoke not a word; and the third\n      night the princess came, and fell on his neck and kissed him. Joy and\n      gladness burst forth throughout the castle, the wedding was celebrated,\n      and he was crowned king of the Golden Mountain.\n    \n\n      They lived together very happily, and the queen had a son. And thus eight\n      years had passed over their heads, when the king thought of his father;\n      and he began to long to see him once again. But the queen was against his\n      going, and said, \u2018I know well that misfortunes will come upon us if you\n      go.\u2019 However, he gave her no rest till she agreed. At his going away she\n      gave him a wishing-ring, and said, \u2018Take this ring, and put it on your\n      finger; whatever you wish it will bring you; only promise never to make\n      use of it to bring me hence to your father\u2019s house.\u2019 Then he said he would\n      do what she asked, and put the ring on his finger, and wished himself near\n      the town where his father lived.\n    \n\n      Heinel found himself at the gates in a moment; but the guards would not\n      let him go in, because he was so strangely clad. So he went up to a\n      neighbouring hill, where a shepherd dwelt, and borrowed his old frock, and\n      thus passed unknown into the town. When he came to his father\u2019s house, he\n      said he was his son; but the merchant would not believe him, and said he\n      had had but one son, his poor Heinel, who he knew was long since dead: and\n      as he was only dressed like a poor shepherd, he would not even give him\n      anything to eat. The king, however, still vowed that he was his son, and\n      said, \u2018Is there no mark by which you would know me if I am really your\n      son?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said his mother, \u2018our Heinel had a mark like a raspberry on\n      his right arm.\u2019 Then he showed them the mark, and they knew that what he\n      had said was true.\n    \n\n      He next told them how he was king of the Golden Mountain, and was married\n      to a princess, and had a son seven years old. But the merchant said, \u2018that\n      can never be true; he must be a fine king truly who travels about in a\n      shepherd\u2019s frock!\u2019 At this the son was vexed; and forgetting his word,\n      turned his ring, and wished for his queen and son. In an instant they\n      stood before him; but the queen wept, and said he had broken his word, and\n      bad luck would follow. He did all he could to soothe her, and she at last\n      seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in truth, and was only thinking\n      how she should punish him.\n    \n\n      One day he took her to walk with him out of the town, and showed her the\n      spot where the boat was set adrift upon the wide waters. Then he sat\n      himself down, and said, \u2018I am very much tired; sit by me, I will rest my\n      head in your lap, and sleep a while.\u2019 As soon as he had fallen asleep,\n      however, she drew the ring from his finger, and crept softly away, and\n      wished herself and her son at home in their kingdom. And when he awoke he\n      found himself alone, and saw that the ring was gone from his finger. \u2018I\n      can never go back to my father\u2019s house,\u2019 said he; \u2018they would say I am a\n      sorcerer: I will journey forth into the world, till I come again to my\n      kingdom.\u2019\n    \n\n      So saying he set out and travelled till he came to a hill, where three\n      giants were sharing their father\u2019s goods; and as they saw him pass they\n      cried out and said, \u2018Little men have sharp wits; he shall part the goods\n      between us.\u2019 Now there was a sword that cut off an enemy\u2019s head whenever\n      the wearer gave the words, \u2018Heads off!\u2019; a cloak that made the owner\n      invisible, or gave him any form he pleased; and a pair of boots that\n      carried the wearer wherever he wished. Heinel said they must first let him\n      try these wonderful things, then he might know how to set a value upon\n      them. Then they gave him the cloak, and he wished himself a fly, and in a\n      moment he was a fly. \u2018The cloak is very well,\u2019 said he: \u2018now give me the\n      sword.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said they; \u2018not unless you undertake not to say, \u201cHeads\n      off!\u201d for if you do we are all dead men.\u2019 So they gave it him, charging\n      him to try it on a tree. He next asked for the boots also; and the moment\n      he had all three in his power, he wished himself at the Golden Mountain;\n      and there he was at once. So the giants were left behind with no goods to\n      share or quarrel about.\n    \n\n      As Heinel came near his castle he heard the sound of merry music; and the\n      people around told him that his queen was about to marry another husband.\n      Then he threw his cloak around him, and passed through the castle hall,\n      and placed himself by the side of the queen, where no one saw him. But\n      when anything to eat was put upon her plate, he took it away and ate it\n      himself; and when a glass of wine was handed to her, he took it and drank\n      it; and thus, though they kept on giving her meat and drink, her plate and\n      cup were always empty.\n    \n\n      Upon this, fear and remorse came over her, and she went into her chamber\n      alone, and sat there weeping; and he followed her there. \u2018Alas!\u2019 said she\n      to herself, \u2018was I not once set free? Why then does this enchantment still\n      seem to bind me?\u2019\n    \n\n      \u2018False and fickle one!\u2019 said he. \u2018One indeed came who set thee free, and\n      he is now near thee again; but how have you used him? Ought he to have had\n      such treatment from thee?\u2019 Then he went out and sent away the company, and\n      said the wedding was at an end, for that he was come back to the kingdom.\n      But the princes, peers, and great men mocked at him. However, he would\n      enter into no parley with them, but only asked them if they would go in\n      peace or not. Then they turned upon him and tried to seize him; but he\n      drew his sword. \u2018Heads Off!\u2019 cried he; and with the word the traitors\u2019\n      heads fell before him, and Heinel was once more king of the Golden\n      Mountain.\n    ",
