    "name": "Grimm - the Juniper-tree",
    "body": "\n      Long, long ago, some two thousand years or so, there lived a rich man with\n      a good and beautiful wife. They loved each other dearly, but sorrowed much\n      that they had no children. So greatly did they desire to have one, that\n      the wife prayed for it day and night, but still they remained childless.\n    \n\n      In front of the house there was a court, in which grew a juniper-tree. One\n      winter\u2019s day the wife stood under the tree to peel some apples, and as she\n      was peeling them, she cut her finger, and the blood fell on the snow.\n      \u2018Ah,\u2019 sighed the woman heavily, \u2018if I had but a child, as red as blood and\n      as white as snow,\u2019 and as she spoke the words, her heart grew light within\n      her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and she returned to\n      the house feeling glad and comforted. A month passed, and the snow had all\n      disappeared; then another month went by, and all the earth was green. So\n      the months followed one another, and first the trees budded in the woods,\n      and soon the green branches grew thickly intertwined, and then the\n      blossoms began to fall. Once again the wife stood under the juniper-tree,\n      and it was so full of sweet scent that her heart leaped for joy, and she\n      was so overcome with her happiness, that she fell on her knees. Presently\n      the fruit became round and firm, and she was glad and at peace; but when\n      they were fully ripe she picked the berries and ate eagerly of them, and\n      then she grew sad and ill. A little while later she called her husband,\n      and said to him, weeping. \u2018If I die, bury me under the juniper-tree.\u2019 Then\n      she felt comforted and happy again, and before another month had passed\n      she had a little child, and when she saw that it was as white as snow and\n      as red as blood, her joy was so great that she died.\n    \n\n      Her husband buried her under the juniper-tree, and wept bitterly for her.\n      By degrees, however, his sorrow grew less, and although at times he still\n      grieved over his loss, he was able to go about as usual, and later on he\n      married again.\n    \n\n      He now had a little daughter born to him; the child of his first wife was\n      a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow. The mother loved her\n      daughter very much, and when she looked at her and then looked at the boy,\n      it pierced her heart to think that he would always stand in the way of her\n      own child, and she was continually thinking how she could get the whole of\n      the property for her. This evil thought took possession of her more and\n      more, and made her behave very unkindly to the boy. She drove him from\n      place to place with cuffings and buffetings, so that the poor child went\n      about in fear, and had no peace from the time he left school to the time\n      he went back.\n    \n\n      One day the little daughter came running to her mother in the store-room,\n      and said, \u2018Mother, give me an apple.\u2019 \u2018Yes, my child,\u2019 said the wife, and\n      she gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest; the chest had a very\n      heavy lid and a large iron lock.\n    \n\n      \u2018Mother,\u2019 said the little daughter again, \u2018may not brother have one too?\u2019\n      The mother was angry at this, but she answered, \u2018Yes, when he comes out of\n      school.\u2019\n    \n\n      Just then she looked out of the window and saw him coming, and it seemed\n      as if an evil spirit entered into her, for she snatched the apple out of\n      her little daughter\u2019s hand, and said, \u2018You shall not have one before your\n      brother.\u2019 She threw the apple into the chest and shut it to. The little\n      boy now came in, and the evil spirit in the wife made her say kindly to\n      him, \u2018My son, will you have an apple?\u2019 but she gave him a wicked look.\n      \u2018Mother,\u2019 said the boy, \u2018how dreadful you look! Yes, give me an apple.\u2019\n      The thought came to her that she would kill him. \u2018Come with me,\u2019 she said,\n      and she lifted up the lid of the chest; \u2018take one out for yourself.\u2019 And\n      as he bent over to do so, the evil spirit urged her, and crash! down went\n      the lid, and off went the little boy\u2019s head. Then she was overwhelmed with\n      fear at the thought of what she had done. \u2018If only I can prevent anyone\n      knowing that I did it,\u2019 she thought. So she went upstairs to her room, and\n      took a white handkerchief out of her top drawer; then she set the boy\u2019s\n      head again on his shoulders, and bound it with the handkerchief so that\n      nothing could be seen, and placed him on a chair by the door with an apple\n      in his hand.\n    \n\n      Soon after this, little Marleen came up to her mother who was stirring a\n      pot of boiling water over the fire, and said, \u2018Mother, brother is sitting\n      by the door with an apple in his hand, and he looks so pale; and when I\n      asked him to give me the apple, he did not answer, and that frightened\n      me.\u2019\n    \n\n      \u2018Go to him again,\u2019 said her mother, \u2018and if he does not answer, give him a\n      box on the ear.\u2019 So little Marleen went, and said, \u2018Brother, give me that\n      apple,\u2019 but he did not say a word; then she gave him a box on the ear, and\n      his head rolled off. She was so terrified at this, that she ran crying and\n      screaming to her mother. \u2018Oh!\u2019 she said, \u2018I have knocked off brother\u2019s\n      head,\u2019 and then she wept and wept, and nothing would stop her.\n    \n\n      \u2018What have you done!\u2019 said her mother, \u2018but no one must know about it, so\n      you must keep silence; what is done can\u2019t be undone; we will make him into\n      puddings.\u2019 And she took the little boy and cut him up, made him into\n      puddings, and put him in the pot. But Marleen stood looking on, and wept\n      and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there was no need of\n      salt.\n    \n\n      Presently the father came home and sat down to his dinner; he asked,\n      \u2018Where is my son?\u2019 The mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish of\n      black pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing.\n    \n\n      The father again asked, \u2018Where is my son?\u2019\n    \n\n      \u2018Oh,\u2019 answered the wife, \u2018he is gone into the country to his mother\u2019s\n      great uncle; he is going to stay there some time.\u2019\n    \n\n      \u2018What has he gone there for, and he never even said goodbye to me!\u2019\n    \n\n      \u2018Well, he likes being there, and he told me he should be away quite six\n      weeks; he is well looked after there.\u2019\n    \n\n      \u2018I feel very unhappy about it,\u2019 said the husband, \u2018in case it should not\n      be all right, and he ought to have said goodbye to me.\u2019\n    \n\n      With this he went on with his dinner, and said, \u2018Little Marleen, why do\n      you weep? Brother will soon be back.\u2019 Then he asked his wife for more\n      pudding, and as he ate, he threw the bones under the table.\n    \n\n      Little Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of\n      her bottom drawer, and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the\n      table and carried them outside, and all the time she did nothing but weep.\n      Then she laid them in the green grass under the juniper-tree, and she had\n      no sooner done so, then all her sadness seemed to leave her, and she wept\n      no more. And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the branches waved\n      backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and then together\n      again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for joy. After this a\n      mist came round the tree, and in the midst of it there was a burning as of\n      fire, and out of the fire there flew a beautiful bird, that rose high into\n      the air, singing magnificently, and when it could no more be seen, the\n      juniper-tree stood there as before, and the silk handkerchief and the\n      bones were gone.\n    \n\n      Little Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were\n      still alive, and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to the\n      table and ate.\n    \n\n      The bird flew away and alighted on the house of a goldsmith and began to\n      sing:\n    \n\n \u2018My mother killed her little son;\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\n  My sister loved me best of all;\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\n  And took my bones that they might lie\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\u2019\n\n\n      The goldsmith was in his workshop making a gold chain, when he heard the\n      song of the bird on his roof. He thought it so beautiful that he got up\n      and ran out, and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his slippers.\n      But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on one foot\n      and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still held the\n      gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing up at the\n      bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.\n    \n\n      \u2018Bird,\u2019 he said, \u2018how beautifully you sing! Sing me that song again.\u2019\n    \n\n      \u2018Nay,\u2019 said the bird, \u2018I do not sing twice for nothing. Give that gold\n      chain, and I will sing it you again.\u2019\n    \n\n      \u2018Here is the chain, take it,\u2019 said the goldsmith. \u2018Only sing me that\n      again.\u2019\n    \n\n      The bird flew down and took the gold chain in his right claw, and then he\n      alighted again in front of the goldsmith and sang:\n    \n\n \u2018My mother killed her little son;\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\n  My sister loved me best of all;\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\n  And took my bones that they might lie\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\u2019\n\n\n      Then he flew away, and settled on the roof of a shoemaker\u2019s house and\n      sang:\n    \n\n \u2018My mother killed her little son;\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\n  My sister loved me best of all;\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\n  And took my bones that they might lie\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\u2019\n\n\n      The shoemaker heard him, and he jumped up and ran out in his\n      shirt-sleeves, and stood looking up at the bird on the roof with his hand\n      over his eyes to keep himself from being blinded by the sun.\n    \n\n      \u2018Bird,\u2019 he said, \u2018how beautifully you sing!\u2019 Then he called through the\n      door to his wife: \u2018Wife, come out; here is a bird, come and look at it and\n      hear how beautifully it sings.\u2019 Then he called his daughter and the\n      children, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran up the\n      street to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was with its red and\n      green feathers, and its neck like burnished gold, and eyes like two bright\n      stars in its head.\n    \n\n      \u2018Bird,\u2019 said the shoemaker, \u2018sing me that song again.\u2019\n    \n\n      \u2018Nay,\u2019 answered the bird, \u2018I do not sing twice for nothing; you must give\n      me something.\u2019\n    \n\n      \u2018Wife,\u2019 said the man, \u2018go into the garret; on the upper shelf you will see\n      a pair of red shoes; bring them to me.\u2019 The wife went in and fetched the\n      shoes.\n    \n\n      \u2018There, bird,\u2019 said the shoemaker, \u2018now sing me that song again.\u2019\n    \n\n      The bird flew down and took the red shoes in his left claw, and then he\n      went back to the roof and sang:\n    \n\n \u2018My mother killed her little son;\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\n  My sister loved me best of all;\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\n  And took my bones that they might lie\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\u2019\n\n\n      When he had finished, he flew away. He had the chain in his right claw and\n      the shoes in his left, and he flew right away to a mill, and the mill went\n      \u2018Click clack, click clack, click clack.\u2019 Inside the mill were twenty of\n      the miller\u2019s men hewing a stone, and as they went \u2018Hick hack, hick hack,\n      hick hack,\u2019 the mill went \u2018Click clack, click clack, click clack.\u2019\n    \n\n      The bird settled on a lime-tree in front of the mill and sang:\n    \n\n \u2018My mother killed her little son;\n\n\n      then one of the men left off,\n    \n\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\n\n\n      two more men left off and listened,\n    \n\n  My sister loved me best of all;\n\n\n      then four more left off,\n    \n\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\n  And took my bones that they might lie\n\nNow there were only eight at work,\n\n  Underneath,\n\nand now only five,\n\n  the juniper-tree.\n\nand now only one,\n\n\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\u2019\n\n\n      then he looked up and the last one had left off work.\n    \n\n      \u2018Bird,\u2019 he said, \u2018what a beautiful song that is you sing! Let me hear it\n      too; sing it again.\u2019\n    \n\n      \u2018Nay,\u2019 answered the bird, \u2018I do not sing twice for nothing; give me that\n      millstone, and I will sing it again.\u2019\n    \n\n      \u2018If it belonged to me alone,\u2019 said the man, \u2018you should have it.\u2019\n    \n\n      \u2018Yes, yes,\u2019 said the others: \u2018if he will sing again, he can have it.\u2019\n    \n\n      The bird came down, and all the twenty millers set to and lifted up the\n      stone with a beam; then the bird put his head through the hole and took\n      the stone round his neck like a collar, and flew back with it to the tree\n      and sang\u2014\n    \n\n \u2018My mother killed her little son;\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\n  My sister loved me best of all;\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\n  And took my bones that they might lie\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\u2019\n\n\n      And when he had finished his song, he spread his wings, and with the chain\n      in his right claw, the shoes in his left, and the millstone round his\n      neck, he flew right away to his father\u2019s house.\n    \n\n      The father, the mother, and little Marleen were having their dinner.\n    \n\n      \u2018How lighthearted I feel,\u2019 said the father, \u2018so pleased and cheerful.\u2019\n    \n\n      \u2018And I,\u2019 said the mother, \u2018I feel so uneasy, as if a heavy thunderstorm\n      were coming.\u2019\n    \n\n      But little Marleen sat and wept and wept.\n    \n\n      Then the bird came flying towards the house and settled on the roof.\n    \n\n      \u2018I do feel so happy,\u2019 said the father, \u2018and how beautifully the sun\n      shines; I feel just as if I were going to see an old friend again.\u2019\n    \n\n      \u2018Ah!\u2019 said the wife, \u2018and I am so full of distress and uneasiness that my\n      teeth chatter, and I feel as if there were a fire in my veins,\u2019 and she\n      tore open her dress; and all the while little Marleen sat in the corner\n      and wept, and the plate on her knees was wet with her tears.\n    \n\n      The bird now flew to the juniper-tree and began singing:\n    \n\n \u2018My mother killed her little son;\n\n\n      the mother shut her eyes and her ears, that she might see and hear\n      nothing, but there was a roaring sound in her ears like that of a violent\n      storm, and in her eyes a burning and flashing like lightning:\n    \n\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\n\n\n      \u2018Look, mother,\u2019 said the man, \u2018at the beautiful bird that is singing so\n      magnificently; and how warm and bright the sun is, and what a delicious\n      scent of spice in the air!\u2019\n    \n\n  My sister loved me best of all;\n\n\n      then little Marleen laid her head down on her knees and sobbed.\n    \n\n      \u2018I must go outside and see the bird nearer,\u2019 said the man.\n    \n\n      \u2018Ah, do not go!\u2019 cried the wife. \u2018I feel as if the whole house were in\n      flames!\u2019\n    \n\n      But the man went out and looked at the bird.\n    \n\n She laid her kerchief over me,\n And took my bones that they might lie\n Underneath the juniper-tree\n Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\u2019\n\n\n      With that the bird let fall the gold chain, and it fell just round the\n      man\u2019s neck, so that it fitted him exactly.\n    \n\n      He went inside, and said, \u2018See, what a splendid bird that is; he has given\n      me this beautiful gold chain, and looks so beautiful himself.\u2019\n    \n\n      But the wife was in such fear and trouble, that she fell on the floor, and\n      her cap fell from her head.\n    \n\n      Then the bird began again:\n    \n\n \u2018My mother killed her little son;\n\n\n      \u2018Ah me!\u2019 cried the wife, \u2018if I were but a thousand feet beneath the earth,\n      that I might not hear that song.\u2019\n    \n\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\n\n\n      then the woman fell down again as if dead.\n    \n\n  My sister loved me best of all;\n\n\n      \u2018Well,\u2019 said little Marleen, \u2018I will go out too and see if the bird will\n      give me anything.\u2019\n    \n\n      So she went out.\n    \n\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\n  And took my bones that they might lie\n\n\n      and he threw down the shoes to her,\n    \n\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\u2019\n\n\n      And she now felt quite happy and lighthearted; she put on the shoes and\n      danced and jumped about in them. \u2018I was so miserable,\u2019 she said, \u2018when I\n      came out, but that has all passed away; that is indeed a splendid bird,\n      and he has given me a pair of red shoes.\u2019\n    \n\n      The wife sprang up, with her hair standing out from her head like flames\n      of fire. \u2018Then I will go out too,\u2019 she said, \u2018and see if it will lighten\n      my misery, for I feel as if the world were coming to an end.\u2019\n    \n\n      But as she crossed the threshold, crash! the bird threw the millstone down\n      on her head, and she was crushed to death.\n    \n\n      The father and little Marleen heard the sound and ran out, but they only\n      saw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot, and when these had\n      passed, there stood the little brother, and he took the father and little\n      Marleen by the hand; then they all three rejoiced, and went inside\n      together and sat down to their dinners and ate.\n    ",
