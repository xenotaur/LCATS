    "name": "Grimm - King Grisly-beard",
    "body": "\n      A great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was very\n      beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the\n      princes who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her, and she\n      only made sport of them.\n    \n\n      Once upon a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all her\n      suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their rank\u2014kings,\n      and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons, and knights.\n      Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them she had something\n      spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat: \u2018He\u2019s as round as a\n      tub,\u2019 said she. The next was too tall: \u2018What a maypole!\u2019 said she. The\n      next was too short: \u2018What a dumpling!\u2019 said she. The fourth was too pale,\n      and she called him \u2018Wallface.\u2019 The fifth was too red, so she called him\n      \u2018Coxcomb.\u2019 The sixth was not straight enough; so she said he was like a\n      green stick, that had been laid to dry over a baker\u2019s oven. And thus she\n      had some joke to crack upon every one: but she laughed more than all at a\n      good king who was there. \u2018Look at him,\u2019 said she; \u2018his beard is like an\n      old mop; he shall be called Grisly-beard.\u2019 So the king got the nickname of\n      Grisly-beard.\n    \n\n      But the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved, and\n      how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or\n      unwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that\n      came to the door.\n    \n\n      Two days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play under\n      the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said, \u2018Let him\n      come in.\u2019 So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when he had sung\n      before the king and the princess, he begged a boon. Then the king said,\n      \u2018You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for your wife.\u2019\n      The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, \u2018I have sworn to give\n      you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.\u2019 So words and tears were\n      of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married to the fiddler.\n      When this was over the king said, \u2018Now get ready to go\u2014you must not\n      stay here\u2014you must travel on with your husband.\u2019\n    \n\n      Then the fiddler went his way, and took her with him, and they soon came\n      to a great wood. \u2018Pray,\u2019 said she, \u2018whose is this wood?\u2019 \u2018It belongs to\n      King Grisly-beard,\u2019 answered he; \u2018hadst thou taken him, all had been\n      thine.\u2019 \u2018Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!\u2019 sighed she; \u2018would that I had\n      married King Grisly-beard!\u2019 Next they came to some fine meadows. \u2018Whose\n      are these beautiful green meadows?\u2019 said she. \u2018They belong to King\n      Grisly-beard, hadst thou taken him, they had all been thine.\u2019 \u2018Ah! unlucky\n      wretch that I am!\u2019 said she; \u2018would that I had married King Grisly-beard!\u2019\n    \n\n      Then they came to a great city. \u2018Whose is this noble city?\u2019 said she. \u2018It\n      belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all been\n      thine.\u2019 \u2018Ah! wretch that I am!\u2019 sighed she; \u2018why did I not marry King\n      Grisly-beard?\u2019 \u2018That is no business of mine,\u2019 said the fiddler: \u2018why\n      should you wish for another husband? Am not I good enough for you?\u2019\n    \n\n      At last they came to a small cottage. \u2018What a paltry place!\u2019 said she; \u2018to\n      whom does that little dirty hole belong?\u2019 Then the fiddler said, \u2018That is\n      your and my house, where we are to live.\u2019 \u2018Where are your servants?\u2019 cried\n      she. \u2018What do we want with servants?\u2019 said he; \u2018you must do for yourself\n      whatever is to be done. Now make the fire, and put on water and cook my\n      supper, for I am very tired.\u2019 But the princess knew nothing of making\n      fires and cooking, and the fiddler was forced to help her. When they had\n      eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the fiddler called her up\n      very early in the morning to clean the house. Thus they lived for two\n      days: and when they had eaten up all there was in the cottage, the man\n      said, \u2018Wife, we can\u2019t go on thus, spending money and earning nothing. You\n      must learn to weave baskets.\u2019 Then he went out and cut willows, and\n      brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made her fingers very\n      sore. \u2018I see this work won\u2019t do,\u2019 said he: \u2018try and spin; perhaps you will\n      do that better.\u2019 So she sat down and tried to spin; but the threads cut\n      her tender fingers till the blood ran. \u2018See now,\u2019 said the fiddler, \u2018you\n      are good for nothing; you can do no work: what a bargain I have got!\n      However, I\u2019ll try and set up a trade in pots and pans, and you shall stand\n      in the market and sell them.\u2019 \u2018Alas!\u2019 sighed she, \u2018if any of my father\u2019s\n      court should pass by and see me standing in the market, how they will\n      laugh at me!\u2019\n    \n\n      But her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she did\n      not wish to die of hunger. At first the trade went well; for many people,\n      seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares, and paid their money\n      without thinking of taking away the goods. They lived on this as long as\n      it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of ware, and she sat\n      herself down with it in the corner of the market; but a drunken soldier\n      soon came by, and rode his horse against her stall, and broke all her\n      goods into a thousand pieces. Then she began to cry, and knew not what to\n      do. \u2018Ah! what will become of me?\u2019 said she; \u2018what will my husband say?\u2019 So\n      she ran home and told him all. \u2018Who would have thought you would have been\n      so silly,\u2019 said he, \u2018as to put an earthenware stall in the corner of the\n      market, where everybody passes? but let us have no more crying; I see you\n      are not fit for this sort of work, so I have been to the king\u2019s palace,\n      and asked if they did not want a kitchen-maid; and they say they will take\n      you, and there you will have plenty to eat.\u2019\n    \n\n      Thus the princess became a kitchen-maid, and helped the cook to do all the\n      dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat that was\n      left, and on this they lived.\n    \n\n      She had not been there long before she heard that the king\u2019s eldest son\n      was passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the windows\n      and looked out. Everything was ready, and all the pomp and brightness of\n      the court was there. Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly\n      which had brought her so low. And the servants gave her some of the rich\n      meats, which she put into her basket to take home.\n    \n\n      All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king\u2019s son in golden\n      clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her by the\n      hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she trembled\n      for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was making sport\n      of her. However, he kept fast hold, and led her in; and the cover of the\n      basket came off, so that the meats in it fell about. Then everybody\n      laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed, that she wished herself\n      a thousand feet deep in the earth. She sprang to the door to run away; but\n      on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and brought her back and\n      said, \u2018Fear me not! I am the fiddler who has lived with you in the hut. I\n      brought you there because I really loved you. I am also the soldier that\n      overset your stall. I have done all this only to cure you of your silly\n      pride, and to show you the folly of your ill-treatment of me. Now all is\n      over: you have learnt wisdom, and it is time to hold our marriage feast.\u2019\n    \n\n      Then the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and\n      her father and his whole court were there already, and welcomed her home\n      on her marriage. Joy was in every face and every heart. The feast was\n      grand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you and\n      I had been of the party.\n    ",
