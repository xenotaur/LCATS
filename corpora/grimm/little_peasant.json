    "name": "Grimm - the Little Peasant",
    "body": "\n      There was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich peasants,\n      and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant. He had not\n      even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and yet he and his\n      wife did so wish to have one. One day he said to her: \u2018Listen, I have a\n      good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall make us a wooden\n      calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any other, and in time it\n      will certainly get big and be a cow.\u2019 the woman also liked the idea, and\n      their gossip the carpenter cut and planed the calf, and painted it as it\n      ought to be, and made it with its head hanging down as if it were eating.\n    \n\n      Next morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant\n      called the cow-herd in and said: \u2018Look, I have a little calf there, but it\n      is still small and has to be carried.\u2019 The cow-herd said: \u2018All right,\u2019 and\n      took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set it among the\n      grass. The little calf always remained standing like one which was eating,\n      and the cow-herd said: \u2018It will soon run by itself, just look how it eats\n      already!\u2019 At night when he was going to drive the herd home again, he said\n      to the calf: \u2018If you can stand there and eat your fill, you can also go on\n      your four legs; I don\u2019t care to drag you home again in my arms.\u2019 But the\n      little peasant stood at his door, and waited for his little calf, and when\n      the cow-herd drove the cows through the village, and the calf was missing,\n      he inquired where it was. The cow-herd answered: \u2018It is still standing out\n      there eating. It would not stop and come with us.\u2019 But the little peasant\n      said: \u2018Oh, but I must have my beast back again.\u2019 Then they went back to\n      the meadow together, but someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone. The\n      cow-herd said: \u2018It must have run away.\u2019 The peasant, however, said: \u2018Don\u2019t\n      tell me that,\u2019 and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his\n      carelessness condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which\n      had run away.\n    \n\n      And now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had so\n      long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for it, and\n      could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed. They salted the\n      flesh, and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell the skin\n      there, so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds. On the way he\n      passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings, and out of pity\n      he took him and wrapped him in the skin. But as the weather grew so bad\n      and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could go no farther, and turned\n      back to the mill and begged for shelter. The miller\u2019s wife was alone in\n      the house, and said to the peasant: \u2018Lay yourself on the straw there,\u2019 and\n      gave him a slice of bread and cheese. The peasant ate it, and lay down\n      with his skin beside him, and the woman thought: \u2018He is tired and has gone\n      to sleep.\u2019 In the meantime came the parson; the miller\u2019s wife received him\n      well, and said: \u2018My husband is out, so we will have a feast.\u2019 The peasant\n      listened, and when he heard them talk about feasting he was vexed that he\n      had been forced to make shift with a slice of bread and cheese. Then the\n      woman served up four different things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine.\n    \n\n      Just as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking outside.\n      The woman said: \u2018Oh, heavens! It is my husband!\u2019 she quickly hid the roast\n      meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow, the salad on the\n      bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the closet on the porch. Then\n      she opened the door for her husband, and said: \u2018Thank heaven, you are back\n      again! There is such a storm, it looks as if the world were coming to an\n      end.\u2019 The miller saw the peasant lying on the straw, and asked, \u2018What is\n      that fellow doing there?\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 said the wife, \u2018the poor knave came in the\n      storm and rain, and begged for shelter, so I gave him a bit of bread and\n      cheese, and showed him where the straw was.\u2019 The man said: \u2018I have no\n      objection, but be quick and get me something to eat.\u2019 The woman said: \u2018But\n      I have nothing but bread and cheese.\u2019 \u2018I am contented with anything,\u2019\n      replied the husband, \u2018so far as I am concerned, bread and cheese will do,\u2019\n      and looked at the peasant and said: \u2018Come and eat some more with me.\u2019 The\n      peasant did not require to be invited twice, but got up and ate. After\n      this the miller saw the skin in which the raven was, lying on the ground,\n      and asked: \u2018What have you there?\u2019 The peasant answered: \u2018I have a\n      soothsayer inside it.\u2019 \u2018Can he foretell anything to me?\u2019 said the miller.\n      \u2018Why not?\u2019 answered the peasant: \u2018but he only says four things, and the\n      fifth he keeps to himself.\u2019 The miller was curious, and said: \u2018Let him\n      foretell something for once.\u2019 Then the peasant pinched the raven\u2019s head,\n      so that he croaked and made a noise like krr, krr. The miller said: \u2018What\n      did he say?\u2019 The peasant answered: \u2018In the first place, he says that there\n      is some wine hidden under the pillow.\u2019 \u2018Bless me!\u2019 cried the miller, and\n      went there and found the wine. \u2018Now go on,\u2019 said he. The peasant made the\n      raven croak again, and said: \u2018In the second place, he says that there is\n      some roast meat in the tiled stove.\u2019 \u2018Upon my word!\u2019 cried the miller, and\n      went thither, and found the roast meat. The peasant made the raven\n      prophesy still more, and said: \u2018Thirdly, he says that there is some salad\n      on the bed.\u2019 \u2018That would be a fine thing!\u2019 cried the miller, and went\n      there and found the salad. At last the peasant pinched the raven once more\n      till he croaked, and said: \u2018Fourthly, he says that there are some cakes\n      under the bed.\u2019 \u2018That would be a fine thing!\u2019 cried the miller, and looked\n      there, and found the cakes.\n    \n\n      And now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller\u2019s wife was\n      frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with her. The\n      miller would have liked much to know the fifth, but the little peasant\n      said: \u2018First, we will quickly eat the four things, for the fifth is\n      something bad.\u2019 So they ate, and after that they bargained how much the\n      miller was to give for the fifth prophecy, until they agreed on three\n      hundred talers. Then the peasant once more pinched the raven\u2019s head till\n      he croaked loudly. The miller asked: \u2018What did he say?\u2019 The peasant\n      replied: \u2018He says that the Devil is hiding outside there in the closet on\n      the porch.\u2019 The miller said: \u2018The Devil must go out,\u2019 and opened the\n      house-door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys, and the peasant\n      unlocked the closet. The parson ran out as fast as he could, and the\n      miller said: \u2018It was true; I saw the black rascal with my own eyes.\u2019 The\n      peasant, however, made off next morning by daybreak with the three hundred\n      talers.\n    \n\n      At home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful\n      house, and the peasants said: \u2018The small peasant has certainly been to the\n      place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in shovels.\u2019\n      Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor, and bidden to say\n      from whence his wealth came. He answered: \u2018I sold my cow\u2019s skin in the\n      town, for three hundred talers.\u2019 When the peasants heard that, they too\n      wished to enjoy this great profit, and ran home, killed all their cows,\n      and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in the town to the\n      greatest advantage. The mayor, however, said: \u2018But my servant must go\n      first.\u2019 When she came to the merchant in the town, he did not give her\n      more than two talers for a skin, and when the others came, he did not give\n      them so much, and said: \u2018What can I do with all these skins?\u2019\n    \n\n      Then the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus\n      outwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of this\n      treachery before the mayor. The innocent little peasant was unanimously\n      sentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water, in a barrel\n      pierced full of holes. He was led forth, and a priest was brought who was\n      to say a mass for his soul. The others were all obliged to retire to a\n      distance, and when the peasant looked at the priest, he recognized the man\n      who had been with the miller\u2019s wife. He said to him: \u2018I set you free from\n      the closet, set me free from the barrel.\u2019 At this same moment up came,\n      with a flock of sheep, the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had long\n      been wishing to be mayor, so he cried with all his might: \u2018No, I will not\n      do it; if the whole world insists on it, I will not do it!\u2019 The shepherd\n      hearing that, came up to him, and asked: \u2018What are you about? What is it\n      that you will not do?\u2019 The peasant said: \u2018They want to make me mayor, if I\n      will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it.\u2019 The shepherd\n      said: \u2018If nothing more than that is needful in order to be mayor, I would\n      get into the barrel at once.\u2019 The peasant said: \u2018If you will get in, you\n      will be mayor.\u2019 The shepherd was willing, and got in, and the peasant shut\n      the top down on him; then he took the shepherd\u2019s flock for himself, and\n      drove it away. The parson went to the crowd, and declared that the mass\n      had been said. Then they came and rolled the barrel towards the water.\n      When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd cried: \u2018I am quite willing to\n      be mayor.\u2019 They believed no otherwise than that it was the peasant who was\n      saying this, and answered: \u2018That is what we intend, but first you shall\n      look about you a little down below there,\u2019 and they rolled the barrel down\n      into the water.\n    \n\n      After that the peasants went home, and as they were entering the village,\n      the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of sheep and\n      looking quite contented. Then the peasants were astonished, and said:\n      \u2018Peasant, from whence do you come? Have you come out of the water?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\n      truly,\u2019 replied the peasant, \u2018I sank deep, deep down, until at last I got\n      to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out of the barrel, and crept out, and\n      there were pretty meadows on which a number of lambs were feeding, and\n      from thence I brought this flock away with me.\u2019 Said the peasants: \u2018Are\n      there any more there?\u2019 \u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 said he, \u2018more than I could want.\u2019 Then\n      the peasants made up their minds that they too would fetch some sheep for\n      themselves, a flock apiece, but the mayor said: \u2018I come first.\u2019 So they\n      went to the water together, and just then there were some of the small\n      fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which are called little lambs, and they\n      were reflected in the water, whereupon the peasants cried: \u2018We already see\n      the sheep down below!\u2019 The mayor pressed forward and said: \u2018I will go down\n      first, and look about me, and if things promise well I\u2019ll call you.\u2019 So he\n      jumped in; splash! went the water; it sounded as if he were calling them,\n      and the whole crowd plunged in after him as one man. Then the entire\n      village was dead, and the small peasant, as sole heir, became a rich man.\n    ",
