    "body": "It was nearly sundown when Ravdin eased the ship down into the last slow\narc toward the Earth's surface. Stretching his arms and legs, he tried\nto relax and ease the tension in his tired muscles. Carefully, he\ntightened the seat belt for landing; below him he could see the vast,\ntangled expanse of Jungle-land spreading out to the horizon. Miles ahead\nwas the bright circle of the landing field and the sparkling glow of the\ncity beyond. Ravdin peered to the north of the city, hoping to catch a\nglimpse of the concert before his ship was swallowed by the brilliant\nlanding lights.\n\nA bell chimed softly in his ear. Ravdin forced his attention back to the\nlanding operation. He was still numb and shaken from the Warp-passage,\nhis mind still muddled by the abrupt and incredible change. Moments\nbefore, the sky had been a vast, starry blanket of black velvet; then,\nabruptly, he had been hovering over the city, sliding down toward warm\nfriendly lights and music. He checked the proper switches, and felt the\nthrobbing purr of the anti-grav motors as the ship slid in toward the\nlanding slot. Tall spires of other ships rose to meet him, circle upon\ncircle of silver needles pointing skyward. A little later they were\nblotted out as the ship was grappled into the berth from which it had\nrisen days before.\n\nWith a sigh, Ravdin eased himself out of the seat, his heart pounding\nwith excitement. Perhaps, he thought, he was too excited, too eager to\nbe home, for his mind was still reeling from the fearful discovery of\nhis journey.\n\nThe station was completely empty as Ravdin walked down the ramp to the\nshuttles. At the desk he checked in with the shiny punch-card robot, and\nwalked swiftly across the polished floor. The wall panels pulsed a\nsomber blue-green, broken sharply by brilliant flashes and overtones of\nscarlet, reflecting with subtle accuracy the tumult in his own mind. Not\na sound was in the air, not a whisper nor sign of human habitation.\nVaguely, uneasiness grew in his mind as he entered the shuttle station.\nSuddenly, the music caught him, a long, low chord of indescribable\nbeauty, rising and falling in the wind, a distant whisper of life....\n\nThe concert, of course. Everyone would be at the concert tonight, and\neven from two miles away, the beauty of four hundred perfectly\nharmonized voices was carried on the breeze. Ravdin's uneasiness\ndisappeared; he was eager to discharge his horrible news, get it off his\nmind and join the others in the great amphitheater set deep in the\nhillside outside the city. But he knew instinctively that Lord Nehmon,\nanticipating his return, would not be at the concert.\n\nRiding the shuttle over the edges of Jungle-land toward the shining\nbright beauty of the city, Ravdin settled back, trying to clear his mind\nof the shock and horror he had encountered on his journey. The curves\nand spires of glowing plastic passed him, lighted with a million hues.\nHe realized that his whole life was entangled in the very beauty of this\nwonderful city. Everything he had ever hoped or dreamed lay sheltered\nhere in the ever-changing rhythm of colors and shapes and sounds. And\nnow, he knew, he would soon see his beloved city burning once again,\nturning to flames and ashes in a heart-breaking memorial to the age-old\nfear of his people.\n\nThe little shuttle-car settled down softly on the green terrace near\nthe center of the city. The building was a masterpiece of smoothly\ncurving walls and tasteful lines, opening a full side to the south to\ncatch the soft sunlight and warm breezes. Ravdin strode across the deep\ncarpeting of the terrace. There was other music here, different music, a\nwilder, more intimate fantasy of whirling sound. An oval door opened for\nhim, and he stopped short, staggered for a moment by the overpowering\nbeauty in the vaulted room.\n\nA girl with red hair the color of new flame was dancing with enthralling\nbeauty and abandon, her body moving like ripples of wind to the music\nwhich filled the room with its throbbing cry. Her beauty was exquisite,\nevery motion, every flowing turn a symphony of flawless perfection as\nshe danced to the wild music.\n\n\"Lord Nehmon!\"\n\nThe dancer threw back her head sharply, eyes wide, her body frozen in\nmid-air, and then, abruptly, she was gone, leaving only the barest\nflickering image of her fiery hair. The music slowed, singing softly,\nand Ravdin could see the old man waiting in the room. Nehmon rose, his\ngaunt face and graying hair belying the youthful movement of his body.\nSmiling, he came forward, clapped Ravdin on the shoulder, and took his\nhand warmly. \"You're too late for the concert--it's a shame. Mischana is\nthe master tonight, and the whole city is there.\"\n\nRavdin's throat tightened as he tried to smile. \"I had to let you know,\"\nhe said. \"_They're coming_, Nehmon! I saw them, hours ago.\"\n\nThe last overtones of the music broke abruptly, like a glass shattered\non stone. The room was deathly still. Lord Nehmon searched the young\nman's face. Then he turned away, not quite concealing the sadness and\npain in his eyes. \"You're certain? You couldn't be mistaken?\"\n\n\"No chance. I found signs of their passing in a dozen places. Then I\nsaw _them_, their whole fleet. There were hundreds. They're coming, I\nsaw them.\"\n\n\"Did they see you?\" Nehmon's voice was sharp.\n\n\"No, no. The Warp is a wonderful thing. With it I could come and go in\nthe twinkling of an eye. But I could see them in the twinkling of an\neye.\"\n\n\"And it couldn't have been anyone else?\"\n\n\"Could anyone else build ships like the Hunters?\"\n\nNehmon sighed wearily. \"No one that we know.\" He glanced up at the young\nman. \"Sit down, son, sit down. I--I'll just have to rearrange my\nthinking a little. Where were they? How far?\"\n\n\"Seven light years,\" Ravdin said. \"Can you imagine it? Just seven, and\nmoving straight this way. _They know where we are_, and they are coming\nquickly.\" His eyes filled with fear. \"They _couldn't_ have found us so\nsoon, unless they too have discovered the Warp and how to use it to\ntravel.\"\n\nThe older man's breath cut off sharply, and there was real alarm in his\neyes. \"You're right,\" he said softly. \"Six months ago it was eight\nhundred light years away, in an area completely remote from us. Now just\n_seven_. In six months they have come so close.\"\n\nThe scout looked up at Nehmon in desperation. \"But what can we do? We\nhave only weeks, maybe days, before they're here. We have no time to\nplan, no time to prepare for them. What can we do?\"\n\nThe room was silent. Finally the aged leader stood up, wearily, some\nfraction of his six hundred years of life showing in his face for the\nfirst time in centuries. \"We can do once again what we always have done\nbefore when the Hunters came,\" he said sadly. \"We can run away.\"\n\n\n\nThe bright street below the oval window was empty and quiet. Not a\nbreath of air stirred in the city. Ravdin stared out in bitter silence.\n\"Yes, we can run away. Just as we always have before. After we have\nworked so hard, accomplished so much here, we must burn the city and\nflee again.\" His voice trailed off to silence. He stared at Nehmon,\nseeking in the old man's face some answer, some reassurance. But he\nfound no answer there, only sadness. \"Think of the concerts. It's taken\nso long, but at last we've come so close to the ultimate goal.\" He\ngestured toward the thought-sensitive sounding boards lining the walls,\nthe panels which had made the dancer-illusion possible. \"Think of the\nbeauty and peace we've found here.\"\n\n\"I know. How well I know.\"\n\n\"Yet now the Hunters come again, and again we must run away.\" Ravdin\nstared at the old man, his eyes suddenly bright. \"Nehmon, when I saw\nthose ships I began thinking.\"\n\n\"I've spent many years thinking, my son.\"\n\n\"Not what I've been thinking.\" Ravdin sat down, clasping his hands in\nexcitement. \"The Hunters come and we run away, Nehmon. Think about that\nfor a moment. We run, and we run, and we run. From what? We run from the\nHunters. They're hunting _us_, these Hunters. They've never quite found\nus, because we've always already run. We're clever, we're fortunate, and\nwe have a way of life that they do not, so whenever they have come close\nto finding us, we have run.\"\n\nNehmon nodded slowly. \"For thousands of years.\"\n\nRavdin's eyes were bright. \"Yes, we flee, we cringe, we hide under\nstones, we break up our lives and uproot our families, running like\nfrightened animals in the shadows of night and secrecy.\" He gulped a\nbreath, and his eyes sought Nehmon's angrily. \"_Why do we run, my\nlord?_\"\n\nNehmon's eyes widened. \"Because we have no choice,\" he said. \"We must\nrun or be killed. You know that. You've seen the records, you've been\ntaught.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I know what I've been taught. I've been taught that eons ago\nour remote ancestors fought the Hunters, and lost, and fled, and were\npursued. But why do we keep running? Time after time we've been\ncornered, and we've turned and fled. _Why?_ Even animals know that when\nthey're cornered they must turn and fight.\"\n\n\"We are not animals.\" Nehmon's voice cut the air like a whiplash.\n\n\"But we could fight.\"\n\n\"Animals fight. We do not. We fought once, like animals, and now we must\nrun from the Hunters who continue to fight like animals. So be it. Let\nthe Hunters fight.\"\n\nRavdin shook his head. \"Do you mean that the Hunters are not men like\nus?\" he said. \"That's what you're saying, that they are animals. All\nright. We kill animals for our food, isn't that true? We kill the\ntiger-beasts in the Jungle to protect ourselves, why not kill the\nHunters to protect ourselves?\"\n\nNehmon sighed, and reached out a hand to the young man. \"I'm sorry,\" he\nsaid gently. \"It seems logical, but it's false logic. The Hunters are\nmen just like you and me. Their lives are different, their culture is\ndifferent, but they are men. And human life is sacred, to us, above all\nelse. This is the fundamental basis of our very existence. Without it we\nwould be Hunters, too. If we fight, we are dead even if we live. That's\nwhy we must run away now, and always. Because we know that we must not\nkill men.\"\n\n\n\nOn the street below, the night air was suddenly full of voices,\nchattering, intermingled with whispers of song and occasional brief\nharmonic flutterings. The footfalls were muted on the polished pavement\nas the people passed slowly, their voices carrying a hint of puzzled\nuneasiness.\n\n\"The concert's over!\" Ravdin walked to the window, feeling a chill pass\nthrough him. \"So soon, I wonder why?\" Eagerly he searched the faces\npassing in the street for Dana's face, sensing the lurking discord in\nthe quiet talk of the crowd. Suddenly the sound-boards in the room\ntinkled a carillon of ruby tones in his ear, and she was in the room,\nrushing into his arms with a happy cry, pressing her soft cheek to his\nrough chin. \"You're back! Oh, I'm so glad, so very glad!\" She turned to\nthe old man. \"Nehmon, what has happened? The concert was ruined tonight.\nThere was something in the air, everybody felt it. For some reason the\npeople seemed _afraid_.\"\n\nRavdin turned away from his bride. \"Tell her,\" he said to the old man.\n\nDana looked at them, her gray eyes widening in horror. \"The Hunters!\nThey've found us?\"\n\nRavdin nodded wordlessly.\n\nHer hands trembled as she sat down, and there were tears in her eyes.\n\"We came so close tonight, so very close. I _felt_ the music before it\nwas sung, do you realize that? I _felt_ the fear around me, even though\nno one said a word. It wasn't vague or fuzzy, it was _clear_! The\ntransference was perfect.\" She turned to face the old man. \"It's taken\nso long to come this far, Nehmon. So much work, so much training to\nreach a perfect communal concert. We've had only two hundred years here,\nonly _two hundred_! I was just a little girl when we came, I can't even\nremember before that. Before we came here we were undisturbed for a\nthousand years, and before that, four thousand. But _two hundred_--we\n_can't_ leave now. Not when we've come so far.\"\n\nRavdin nodded. \"That's the trouble. They come closer every time. This\ntime they will catch us. Or the next time, or the next. And that will be\nthe end of everything for us, unless we fight them.\" He paused, watching\nthe last groups dispersing on the street below. \"If we only knew, for\ncertain, what we were running from.\"\n\nThere was a startled silence. The girl's breath came in a gasp and her\neyes widened as his words sank home. \"Ravdin,\" she said softly, \"_have\nyou ever seen a Hunter_?\"\n\nRavdin stared at her, and felt a chill of excitement. Music burst from\nthe sounding-board, odd, wild music, suddenly hopeful. \"No,\" he said,\n\"no, of course not. You know that.\"\n\nThe girl rose from her seat. \"Nor have I. Never, not once.\" She turned\nto Lord Nehmon. \"Have _you_?\"\n\n\"Never.\" The old man's voice was harsh.\n\n\"Has _anyone_ ever seen a Hunter?\"\n\nRavdin's hand trembled. \"I--I don't know. None of us living now, no.\nIt's been too long since they last actually found us. I've read--oh, I\ncan't remember. I think my grandfather saw them, or my great-grandfather,\nsomewhere back there. It's been thousands of years.\"\n\n\"Yet we've been tearing ourselves up by the roots, fleeing from planet\nto planet, running and dying and still running. But suppose we don't\nneed to run anymore?\"\n\nHe stared at her. \"They keep coming. They keep searching for us. What\nmore proof do you need?\"\n\nDana's face glowed with excitement, alive with new vitality, new hope.\n\"Ravdin, can't you see? _They might have changed._ They might not be the\nsame. Things can happen. Look at us, how we've grown since the wars with\nthe Hunters. Think how our philosophy and culture have matured! Oh,\nRavdin, you were to be master at a concert next month. Think how the\nconcerts have changed! Even my grandmother can remember when the\nconcerts were just a few performers playing, and everyone else just\nsitting and _listening_! Can you imagine anything more silly? They\nhadn't even thought of transference then, they never dreamed what a\n_real_ concert could be! Why, those people had never begun to understand\nmusic until they themselves became a part of it. Even we can see these\nchanges, why couldn't the Hunters have grown and changed just as we\nhave?\"\n\nNehmon's voice broke in, almost harshly, as he faced the excited pair.\n\"The Hunters don't have concerts,\" he said grimly. \"You're deluding\nyourself, Dana. They laugh at our music, they scoff at our arts and\ntwist them into obscene mockeries. They have no concept of beauty in\ntheir language. The Hunters are incapable of change.\"\n\n\"And you can be certain of that when _nobody has seen them for thousands\nof years_?\"\n\nNehmon met her steady eyes, read the strength and determination there.\nHe knew, despairingly, what she was thinking--that he was old, that he\ncouldn't understand, that his mind was channeled now beyond the approach\nof wisdom. \"You mustn't think what you're thinking,\" he said weakly.\n\"You'd be blind. You wouldn't know, you couldn't have any idea what you\nwould find. If you tried to contact them, you could be lost completely,\ntortured, killed. If they haven't changed, you wouldn't stand a chance.\nYou'd never come back, Dana.\"\n\n\"But she's right all the same,\" Ravdin said softly. \"You're wrong, my\nlord. We can't continue this way if we're to survive. Sometime our\npeople must contact them, find the link that was once between us, and\nforge it strong again. We could do it, Dana and I.\"\n\n\"I could forbid you to go.\"\n\nDana looked at her husband, and her eyes were proud. \"You could forbid\nus,\" she said, facing the old man. \"But you could never stop us.\"\n\n\n\nAt the edge of the Jungle-land a great beast stood with green-gleaming\neyes, licking his fanged jaws as he watched the glowing city, sensing\nsomehow that the mystifying circle of light and motion was soon to\nbecome his Jungle-land again. In the city the turmoil bubbled over, as\nwave after wave of the people made the short safari across the\nintervening jungle to the circles of their ships. Husbands, wives,\nfathers, mothers--all carried their small, frail remembrances out to the\nships. There was music among them still, but it was a different sort of\nmusic, now, an eerie, hopeless music that drifted out of the city in the\nwind. It caused all but the bravest of the beasts, their hair prickling\non their backs, to run in panic through the jungle darkness. It was a\nmelancholy music, carried from thought to thought, from voice to voice\nas the people of the city wearily prepared themselves once again for the\nlong journey.\n\nTo run away. In the darkness of secrecy, to be gone, without a trace,\nwithout symbol or vestige of their presence, leaving only the scorched\ncircle of land for the jungle to reclaim, so that no eyes, not even the\nsharpest, would ever know how long they had stayed, nor where they might\nhave gone.\n\nIn the rounded room of his house, Lord Nehmon dispatched the last of his\nbelongings, a few remembrances, nothing more, because the space on the\nships must take people, not remembrances, and he knew that the\nremembrances would bring only pain. All day Nehmon had supervised the\nloading, the intricate preparation, following plans laid down millennia\nbefore. He saw the libraries and records transported, mile upon endless\nmile of microfilm, carted to the ships prepared to carry them, stored\nuntil a new resting place was found. The history of a people was\nrecorded on that film, a people once proud and strong, now equally\nproud, but dwindling in numbers as toll for the constant roving. A proud\npeople, yet a people who would turn and run without thought, in a panic\nof age-old fear. They _had_ to run, Nehmon knew, if they were to\nsurvive.\n\nAnd with a blaze of anger in his heart, he almost hated the two young\npeople waiting here with him for the last ship to be filled. For these\ntwo would not go.\n\nIt had been a long and painful night. He had pleaded and begged, tried\nto persuade them that there was no hope, that the very idea of remaining\nbehind or trying to contact the Hunters was insane. Yet he knew _they_\nwere sane, perhaps unwise, naive, but their decision had been reached,\nand they would not be shaken.\n\nThe day was almost gone as the last ships began to fill. Nehmon turned\nto Ravdin and Dana, his face lined and tired. \"You'll have to go soon,\"\nhe said. \"The city will be burned, of course, as always. You'll be left\nwith food, and with weapons against the jungle. The Hunters will know\nthat we've been here, but they'll not know when, nor where we have\ngone.\" He paused. \"It will be up to you to see that they don't learn.\"\n\nDana shook her head. \"We'll tell them nothing, unless it's safe for them\nto know.\"\n\n\"They'll question you, even torture you.\"\n\nShe smiled calmly. \"Perhaps they won't. But as a last resort, we can\nblank out.\"\n\nNehmon's face went white. \"You know there is no coming back, once you do\nthat. You would never regain your memory. You must save it for a last\nresort.\"\n\nDown below on the street the last groups of people were passing; the\nlast sweet, eerie tones of the concert were rising in the gathering\ntwilight. Soon the last families would have taken their refuge in the\nships, waiting for Nehmon to trigger the fire bombs to ignite the\nbeautiful city after the ships started on their voyage. The concerts\nwere over; there would be long years of aimless wandering before another\nhome could be found, another planet safe from the Hunters and their\nships. Even then it would be more years before the concerts could again\nrise from their hearts and throats and minds, generations before they\ncould begin work again toward the climactic expression of their\nheritage.\n\nRavdin felt the desolation in the people's minds, saw the utter\nhopelessness in the old man's face, and suddenly felt the pressure of\ndespair. It was such a slender hope, so frail and so dangerous. He knew\nof the terrible fight, the war of his people against the Hunters, so\nmany thousand years before. They had risen together, a common people,\ntheir home a single planet. And then, the gradual splitting of the\nnations, his own people living in peace, seeking the growth and beauty\nof the arts, despising the bitterness and barrenness of hatred and\nkilling--and the Hunters, under an iron heel of militarism, of\ngovernment for the perpetuation of government, split farther and farther\nfrom them. It was an ever-widening split as the Hunters sneered and\nridiculed, and then grew to hate Ravdin's people for all the things the\nHunters were losing: peace, love, happiness. Ravdin knew of his people's\nslowly dawning awareness of the sanctity of life, shattered abruptly by\nthe horrible wars, and then the centuries of fear and flight, hiding\nfrom the wrath of the Hunters' vengeance. His people had learned much in\nthose long years. They had conquered disease. They had grown in strength\nas they dwindled in numbers. But now the end could be seen, crystal\nclear, the end of his people and a ghastly grave.\n\nNehmon's voice broke the silence. \"If you must stay behind, then go now.\nThe city will burn an hour after the count-down.\"\n\n\"We will be safe, outside the city.\" Dana gripped her husband's hand,\ntrying to transmit to him some part of her strength and confidence.\n\"Wish us the best, Nehmon. If a link can be forged, we will forge it.\"\n\n\"I wish you the best in everything.\" There were tears in the old man's\neyes as he turned and left the room.\n\n\n\nThey stood in the Jungle-land, listening to the scurry of frightened\nanimals, and shivering in the cool night air as the bright sparks of the\nships' exhausts faded into the black starry sky. A man and a woman\nalone, speechless, watching, staring with awful longing into the skies\nas the bright rocket jets dwindled to specks and flickered out.\n\nThe city burned. Purple spumes of flame shot high into the air, throwing\na ghastly light on the frightened Jungle-land. Spires of flame seemed to\nbe seeking the stars with their fingers as the plastic walls and streets\nof the city hissed and shriveled, blackening, bubbling into a vanishing\nmemory before their eyes. The flames shot high, carrying with them the\nlast remnants of the city which had stood proud and tall an hour before.\nThen a silence fell, deathly, like the lifeless silence of a grave. Out\nof the silence, little whispering sounds of the Jungle-land crept to\ntheir ears, first frightened, then curious, then bolder and bolder as\nthe wisps of grass and little animals ventured out and out toward the\nclearing where the city had stood. Bit by bit the Jungle-land gathered\ncourage, and the clearing slowly, silently, began to disappear.\n\nDays later new sparks of light appeared in the black sky. They grew to\nlarger specks, then to flares, and finally settled to the earth as\npowerful, flaming jets.\n\nThey were squat, misshapen vessels, circling down like vultures,\nhissing, screeching, landing with a grinding crash in the tall thicket\nnear the place where the city had stood. Ravdin's signal had guided them\nin, and the Hunters had seen them, standing on a hilltop above the\ndemolished amphitheater. Men had come out of the ships, large men with\ncold faces and dull eyes, weapons strapped to their trim uniforms. The\nHunters had blinked at them, unbelieving, with their weapons held at\nready. Ravdin and Dana were seized and led to the flagship.\n\nAs they approached it, their hearts sank and they clasped hands to\nbolster their failing hope.\n\nThe leader of the Hunters looked up from his desk as they were thrust\ninto his cabin. Frankle's face was a graven mask as he searched their\nfaces dispassionately. The captives were pale and seemed to cringe from\nthe pale interrogation light. \"Chickens!\" the Hunter snorted. \"We have\nbeen hunting down chickens.\" His eyes turned to one of the guards. \"They\nhave been searched?\"\n\n\"Of course, master.\"\n\n\"And questioned?\"\n\nThe guard frowned. \"Yes, sir. But their language is almost\nunintelligible.\"\n\n\"You've studied the basic tongues, haven't you?\" Frankle's voice was as\ncold as his eyes.\n\n\"Of course, sir, but this is so different.\"\n\nFrankle stared in contempt at the fair-skinned captives, fixing his\neyes on them for a long moment. Finally he said, \"Well?\"\n\nRavdin glanced briefly at Dana's white face. His voice seemed weak and\nhigh-pitched in comparison to the Hunter's baritone. \"You are the leader\nof the Hunters?\"\n\nFrankle regarded him sourly, without replying. His thin face was\nswarthy, his short-cut gray hair matching the cold gray of his eyes. It\nwas an odd face, completely blank of any thought or emotion, yet capable\nof shifting to a strange biting slyness in the briefest instant. It was\na rich face, a face of inscrutable depth. He pushed his chair back, his\neyes watchful. \"We know your people were here,\" he said suddenly. \"Now\nthey've gone, and yet you remain behind. There must be a reason for such\nrashness. Are you sick? Crippled?\"\n\nRavdin shook his head. \"We are not sick.\"\n\n\"Then criminals, perhaps? Being punished for rebellious plots?\"\n\n\"We are not criminals.\"\n\nThe Hunter's fist crashed on the desk. \"Then why are you here? _Why?_\nAre you going to tell me now, or do you propose to waste a few hours of\nmy time first?\"\n\n\"There is no mystery,\" Ravdin said softly. \"We stayed behind to plead\nfor peace.\"\n\n\"For peace?\" Frankle stared in disbelief. Then he shrugged, his face\ntired. \"I might have known. Peace! Where have your people gone?\"\n\nRavdin met him eye for eye. \"I can't say.\"\n\nThe Hunter laughed. \"Let's be precise, you don't _choose_ to say, just\nnow. But perhaps very soon you will wish with all your heart to tell\nme.\"\n\nDana's voice was sharp. \"We're telling you the truth. We want peace,\nnothing more. This constant hunting and running is senseless, exhausting\nto both of us. We want to make peace with you, to bring our people\ntogether again.\"\n\nFrankle snorted. \"You came to us in war, once, long ago. Now you want\npeace. What would you do, clasp us to your bosom, smother us in your\nidiotic music? Or have you gone on to greater things?\"\n\nRavdin's face flushed hotly. \"Much greater things,\" he snapped.\n\nFrankle sat down slowly. \"No doubt,\" he said. \"Now understand me\nclearly. Very soon you will be killed. How quickly or slowly you die\nwill depend largely upon the civility of your tongues. A civil tongue\nanswers questions with the right answers. That is my definition of a\ncivil tongue.\" He sat back coldly. \"Now, shall we commence asking\nquestions?\"\n\nDana stepped forward suddenly, her cheeks flushed. \"We don't have the\nwords to express ourselves,\" she said softly. \"We can't tell you in\nwords what we have to say, but music is a language even you can\nunderstand. We can tell you what we want in music.\"\n\nFrankle scowled. He knew about the magic of this music, he had heard of\nthe witchcraft these weak chicken-people could weave, of their strange,\nmagic power to steal strong men's minds from them and make them like\nchildren before wolves. But he had never heard this music with his own\nears. He looked at them, his eyes strangely bright. \"You know I cannot\nlisten to your music. It is forbidden, even you should know that. How\ndare you propose--\"\n\n\"But this is different music.\" Dana's eyes widened, and she threw an\nexcited glance at her husband. \"Our music is beautiful, wonderful to\nhear. If you could only hear it--\"\n\n\"Never.\" The man hesitated. \"Your music is forbidden, poisonous.\"\n\nHer smile was like sweet wine, a smile that worked into the Hunter's\nmind like a gentle, lazy drug. \"But who is to permit or forbid? After\nall, you are the leader here, and forbidden pleasures are all the\nsweeter.\"\n\nFrankle's eyes were on hers, fascinated. Slowly, with a graceful\nmovement, she drew the gleaming thought-sensitive stone from her\nclothing. It glowed in the room with a pearly luminescence, and she saw\nthe man's eyes turning to it, drawn as if by magic. Then he looked away,\nand a cruel smile curled his lips. He motioned toward the stone. \"All\nright,\" he said mockingly. \"Do your worst. Show me your precious music.\"\n\nLike a tinkle of glass breaking in a well, the stone flashed its fiery\nlight in the room. Little swirls of music seemed to swell from it,\nblossoming in the silence. Frankle tensed, a chill running up his spine,\nhis eyes drawn back to the gleaming jewel. Suddenly, the music filled\nthe room, rising sweetly like an overpowering wave, filling his mind\nwith strange and wonderful images. The stone shimmered and changed,\ntaking the form of dancing clouds of light, swirling with the music as\nit rose. Frankle felt his mind groping toward the music, trying\ndesperately to reach into the heart of it, to become part of it.\n\nRavdin and Dana stood there, trancelike, staring transfixed at the\ngleaming center of light, forcing their joined minds to create the\ncrashing, majestic chords as the song lifted from the depths of oblivion\nto the heights of glory in the old, old song of their people.\n\nA song of majesty, and strength, and dignity. A song of love, of\naspiration, a song of achievement. A song of peoples driven by ancient\nfears across the eons of space, seeking only peace, even peace with\nthose who drove them.\n\nFrankle heard the music, and could not comprehend, for his mind could\nnot grasp the meaning, the true overtones of those glorious chords, but\nhe felt the strangeness in the pangs of fear which groped through his\nmind, cringing from the wonderful strains, dazzled by the dancing light.\nHe stared wide-eyed and trembling at the couple across the room, and for\nan instant it seemed that he was stripped naked. For a fleeting moment\nthe authority was gone from his face; gone too was the cruelty, the\navarice, the sardonic mockery. For the briefest moment his cold gray\neyes grew incredibly tender with a sudden ancient, long-forgotten\nlonging, crying at last to be heard.\n\nAnd then, with a scream of rage he was stumbling into the midst of the\nlight, lashing out wildly at the heart of its shimmering brilliance. His\nhuge hand caught the hypnotic stone and swept it into crashing,\near-splitting cacophony against the cold steel bulkhead. He stood rigid,\nhis whole body shaking, eyes blazing with fear and anger and hatred as\nhe turned on Ravdin and Dana. His voice was a raging storm of bitterness\ndrowning out the dying strains of the music.\n\n\"Spies! You thought you could steal my mind away, make me forget my duty\nand listen to your rotten, poisonous noise! Well, you failed, do you\nhear? I didn't hear it, I didn't listen, _I didn't_! I'll hunt you down\nas my fathers hunted you down, I'll bring my people their vengeance and\nglory, and your foul music will be dead!\"\n\nHe turned to the guards, wildly, his hands still trembling. \"Take them\nout! Whip them, burn them, do anything! But find out where their people\nhave gone. Find out! Music! We'll take the music out of them, once and\nfor all.\"\n\n\n\nThe inquisition had been horrible. Their minds had had no concept of\nsuch horror, such relentless, racking pain. The blazing lights, the\nquestions screaming in their ears, Frankle's vicious eyes burning in\nfrustration, and their own screams, rising with each question they would\nnot answer until their throats were scorched and they could no longer\nscream. Finally they reached the limit they could endure, and muttered\ntogether the hoarse words that could deliver them. Not words that\nFrankle could hear, but words to bring deliverance, to blank out their\nminds like a wet sponge over slate. The hypnotic key clicked into the\nlock of their minds; their screams died in their brains. Frankle stared\nat them, and knew instantly what they had done, a technique of memory\nobliteration known and dreaded for so many thousands of years that\nhistory could not remember. As his captives stood mindless before him,\nhe let out one hoarse, agonized scream of frustration and defeat.\n\nBut strangely enough he did not kill them. He left them on a cold stone\nledge, blinking dumbly at each other as the ships of his fleet rose one\nby one and vanished like fireflies in the dark night sky. Naked, they\nsat alone on the planet of the Jungle-land. They knew no words, no\nmusic, nothing. And they did not even know that in the departing ships a\nseed had been planted. For Frankle _had_ heard the music. He had grasped\nthe beauty of his enemies for that brief instant, and in that instant\nthey had become less his enemies. A tiny seed of doubt had been planted.\nThe seed would grow.\n\nThe two sat dumbly, shivering. Far in the distance, a beast roared\nagainst the heavy night, and a light rain began to fall. They sat naked,\nthe rain soaking their skin and hair. Then one of them grunted, and\nmoved into the dry darkness of the cave. Deep within him some instinct\nspoke, warning him to fear the roar of the animal.\n\nBlinking dully, the woman crept into the cave after him. Three thoughts\nalone filled their empty minds. Not thoughts of Nehmon and his people;\nto them, Nehmon had never existed, forgotten as completely as if he had\nnever been. No thoughts of the Hunters, either, nor of their unheard-of\nmercy in leaving them their lives--lives of memoryless oblivion, like\nanimals in this green Jungle-land, but lives nonetheless.\n\nOnly three thoughts filled their minds:\n\nIt was raining.\n\nThey were hungry.\n\nThe Saber-tooth was prowling tonight.\n\nThey never knew that the link had been forged.\n\n\n\n\n",
