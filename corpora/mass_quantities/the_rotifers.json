    "body": "Henry Chatham knelt by the brink of his garden pond, a glass fish bowl\ncupped in his thin, nervous hands. Carefully he dipped the bowl into the\ngreen-scummed water and, moving it gently, let trailing streamers of\nsubmerged water weeds drift into it. Then he picked up the old scissors\nhe had laid on the bank, and clipped the stems of the floating plants,\ngetting as much of them as he could in the container.\n\nWhen he righted the bowl and got stiffly to his feet, it contained, he\nthought hopefully, a fair cross-section of fresh-water plankton. He was\npleased with himself for remembering that term from the book he had\nstudied assiduously for the last few nights in order to be able to cope\nwith Harry\u2019s inevitable questions.\n\nThere was even a shiny black water beetle doing insane circles on the\nsurface of the water in the fish bowl. At sight of the insect, the eyes\nof the twelve-year-old boy, who had been standing by in silent\nexpectation, widened with interest.\n\n\"What\u2019s that thing, Dad?\" he asked excitedly. \"What\u2019s that crazy bug?\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t know its scientific name, I\u2019m afraid,\" said Henry Chatham. \"But\nwhen I was a boy we used to call them whirligig beetles.\"\n\n\"He doesn\u2019t seem to think he has enough room in the bowl,\" said Harry\nthoughtfully. \"Maybe we better put him back in the pond, Dad.\"\n\n\"I thought you might want to look at him through the microscope,\" the\nfather said in some surprise.\n\n\"I think we ought to put him back,\" insisted Harry. Mr. Chatham held the\ndripping bowl obligingly. Harry\u2019s hand, a thin boy\u2019s hand with narrow\nsensitive fingers, hovered over the water, and when the beetle paused\nfor a moment in its gyrations, made a dive for it.\n\nBut the whirligig beetle saw the hand coming, and, quicker than a wink,\nplunged under the water and scooted rapidly to the very bottom of the\nbowl.\n\nHarry\u2019s young face was rueful; he wiped his wet hand on his trousers. \"I\nguess he wants to stay,\" he supposed.\n\nThe two went up the garden path together and into the house, Mr. Chatham\nbearing the fish bowl before him like a votive offering. Harry\u2019s mother\nmet them at the door, brandishing an old towel.\n\n\"Here,\" she said firmly, \"you wipe that thing off before you bring it in\nthe house. And don\u2019t drip any of that dirty pond water on my good\ncarpet.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s not dirty,\" said Henry Chatham. \"It\u2019s just full of life, plants\nand animals too small for the eye to see. But Harry\u2019s going to see them\nwith his microscope.\" He accepted the towel and wiped the water and\nslime from the outside of the bowl; then, in the living-room, he set it\nbeside an open window, where the life-giving summer sun slanted in and\nfell on the green plants.\n\n                                  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe brand-new microscope stood nearby, in a good light. It was an\nexpensive microscope, no toy for a child, and it magnified four hundred\ndiameters. Henry Chatham had bought it because he believed that his only\nson showed a desire to peer into the mysteries of smallness, and so far\nHarry had not disappointed him; he had been ecstatic over the\ninstrument. Together they had compared hairs from their two heads, had\nseen the point of a fine sewing needle made to look like the tip of a\ncrowbar by the lowest power of the microscope, had made grains of salt\nlook like discarded chunks of glass brick, had captured a house-fly and\nmarvelled at its clawed hairy feet, its great red faceted eyes, and the\ndelicate veining and fringing of its wings.\n\nHarry was staring at the bowl of pond water in a sort of fascination.\n\"Are there germs in the water, Dad? Mother says pond water is full of\ngerms.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" answered Mr. Chatham, somewhat embarrassed. The book on\nmicroscopic fresh-water fauna had been explicit about _Paramecium_ and\n_Euglena_, diatomes and rhizopods, but it had failed to mention anything\nso vulgar as germs. But he supposed that which the book called Protozoa,\nthe one-celled animalcules, were the same as germs.\n\nHe said, \"To look at things in water like this, you want to use a\nwell-slide. It tells how to fix one in the instruction book.\"\n\nHe let Harry find the glass slide with a cup ground into it, and another\nsmooth slip of glass to cover it. Then he half-showed, half-told him how\nto scrape gently along the bottom sides of the drifting leaves, to\ncapture the teeming life that dwelt there in the slime. When the boy\nunderstood, his young hands were quickly more skillful than his\nfather\u2019s; they filled the well with a few drops of water that was\npromisingly green and murky.\n\nAlready Harry knew how to adjust the lighting mirror under the stage of\nthe microscope and turn the focusing screws. He did so, bent intently\nover the eyepiece, squinting down the polished barrel in the happy\nexpectation of wonders.\n\nHenry Chatham\u2019s eyes wandered to the fish bowl, where the whirligig\nbeetle had come to the top again and was describing intricate patterns\namong the water plants. He looked back to his son, and saw that Harry\nhad ceased to turn the screws and instead was just looking\u2014looking with\na rapt, delicious fixity. His hands lay loosely clenched on the table\ntop, and he hardly seemed to breathe. Only once or twice his lips moved\nas if to shape an exclamation that was snatched away by some new vision.\n\n\"Have you got it, Harry?\" asked his father after two or three minutes\nduring which the boy did not move.\n\nHarry took a last long look, then glanced up, blinking slightly.\n\n\"You look, Dad!\" he exclaimed warmly. \"It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s like a garden in the\nwater, full of funny little people!\"\n\nMr. Chatham, not reluctantly, bent to gaze into the eyepiece. This was\nnew to him too, and instantly he saw the aptness of Harry\u2019s simile.\nThere was a garden there, of weird, green, transparent stalks composed\nof plainly visible cells fastened end to end, with globules and bladders\nlike fruits or seed-pods attached to them, floating among them; and in\nthe garden the strange little people swam to and fro, or clung with odd\nappendages to the stalks and branches. Their bodies were transparent\nlike the plants, and in them were pulsing hearts and other organs\nplainly visible. They looked a little like sea horses with pointed\ntails, but their heads were different, small and rounded, with big,\ndark, glistening eyes.\n\nAll at once Mr. Chatham realized that Harry was speaking to him, still\nin high excitement.\n\n\"What are they, Dad?\" he begged to know.\n\nHis father straightened up and shook his head puzzledly. \"I don\u2019t know,\nHarry,\" he answered slowly, casting about in his memory. He seemed to\nremember a microphotograph of a creature like those in the book he had\nstudied, but the name that had gone with it eluded him. He had worked as\nan accountant for so many years that his memory was all for figures now.\n\nHe bent over once more to immerse his eyes and mind in the green\nwater-garden on the slide. The little creatures swam to and fro as\nbefore, growing hazy and dwindling or swelling as they swam out of the\nnarrow focus of the lens; he gazed at those who paused in sharp\ndefinition, and saw that, although he had at first seen no visible means\nof propulsion, each creature bore about its head a halo of thread-like,\nflickering cilia that lashed the water and drew it forward, for all the\nworld like an airplane propeller or a rapidly turning wheel.\n\n\"I know what they are!\" exclaimed Henry Chatham, turning to his son with\nan almost boyish excitement. \"They\u2019re rotifers! That means\n\u2019wheel-bearers\u2019, and they were called that because to the first\nscientists who saw them it looked like they swam with wheels.\"\n\nHarry had got down the book and was leafing through the pages. He looked\nup seriously. \"Here they are,\" he said. \"Here\u2019s a picture that looks\nalmost like the ones in our pond water.\"\n\n\"Let\u2019s see,\" said his father. They looked at the pictures and\ndescriptions of the Rotifera; there was a good deal of concrete\ninformation on the habits and physiology of these odd and complex little\nanimals who live their swarming lives in the shallow, stagnant waters of\nthe Earth. It said that they were much more highly organized than\nProtozoa, having a discernible heart, brain, digestive system, and\nnervous system, and that their reproduction was by means of two sexes\nlike that of the higher orders. Beyond that, they were a mystery; their\nrelationship to other life-forms remained shrouded in doubt.\n\n\"You\u2019ve got something interesting there,\" said Henry Chatham with\nsatisfaction. \"Maybe you\u2019ll find out something about them that nobody\nknows yet.\"\n\nHe was pleased when Harry spent all the rest of that Sunday afternoon\npeering into the microscope, watching the rotifers, and even more\npleased when the boy found a pencil and paper and tried, in an\namateurish way, to draw and describe what he saw in the green\nwater-garden.\n\nBeyond a doubt, Henry thought, here was a hobby that had captured Harry\nas nothing else ever had.\n\n                                  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMrs. Chatham was not so pleased. When her husband laid down his evening\npaper and went into the kitchen for a drink of water, she cornered him\nand hissed at him: \"I told you you had no business buying Harry a thing\nlike that! If he keeps on at this rate, he\u2019ll wear his eyes out in no\ntime.\"\n\nHenry Chatham set down his water glass and looked straight at his wife.\n\"Sally, Harry\u2019s eyes are young and he\u2019s using them to learn with. You\u2019ve\nnever been much worried over me, using my eyes up eight hours a day,\nfive days a week, over a blind-alley bookkeeping job.\"\n\nHe left her angrily silent and went back to his paper. He would lower\nthe paper every now and then to watch Harry, in his corner of the\nliving-room, bowed obliviously over the microscope and the secret life\nof the rotifers.\n\nOnce the boy glanced up from his periodic drawing and asked, with the\nair of one who proposes a pondered question: \"Dad, if you look through a\nmicroscope the wrong way is it a telescope?\"\n\nMr. Chatham lowered his paper and bit his underlip. \"I don\u2019t think\nso\u2014no, I don\u2019t know. When you look through a microscope, it makes things\nseem closer\u2014one way, that is; if you looked the other way, it would\nprobably make them seem farther off. What did you want to know for?\"\n\n\"Oh\u2014nothing,\" Harry turned back to his work. As if on after-thought, he\nexplained, \"I was wondering if the rotifers could see me when I\u2019m\nlooking at them.\"\n\nMr. Chatham laughed, a little nervously, because the strange fancies\nwhich his son sometimes voiced upset his ordered mind. Remembering the\ndark glistening eyes of the rotifers he had seen, however, he could\nrecognize whence this question had stemmed.\n\nAt dusk, Harry insisted on setting up the substage lamp which had been\nbought with the microscope, and by whose light he could go on looking\nuntil his bedtime, when his father helped him arrange a wick to feed the\nlittle glass-covered well in the slide so it would not dry up before\nmorning. It was unwillingly, and only after his mother\u2019s strenuous\ncomplaints, that the boy went to bed at ten o\u2019clock.\n\nIn the following days his interest became more and more intense. He\nspent long hours, almost without moving, watching the rotifers. For the\nlittle animals had become the sole object which he desired to study\nunder the microscope, and even his father found it difficult to\nunderstand such an enthusiasm.\n\nDuring the long hours at the office to which he commuted, Henry Chatham\noften found the vision of his son, absorbed with the invisible world\nthat the microscope had opened to him, coming between him and the\ncolumns in the ledgers. And sometimes, too, he envisioned the dim green\nwater-garden where the little things swam to and fro, and a strangeness\nfilled his thoughts.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, he glanced at the fish bowl and noticed that the\nwater beetle, the whirligig beetle, was missing. Casually, he asked his\nson about it.\n\n\"I had to get rid of him,\" said the boy with a trace of uneasiness in\nhis manner. \"I took him out and squashed him.\"\n\n\"Why did you have to do that?\"\n\n\"He was eating the rotifers and their eggs,\" said Harry, with what\nseemed to be a touch of remembered anger at the beetle. He glanced\ntoward his work-table, where three or four well-slides with small green\npools under their glass covers now rested in addition to the one that\nwas under the microscope.\n\n\"How did you find out he was eating them?\" inquired Mr. Chatham, feeling\na warmth of pride at the thought that Harry had discovered such a\nscientific fact for himself.\n\nThe boy hesitated oddly. \"I\u2014I looked it up in the book,\" he answered.\n\nHis father masked his faint disappointment. \"That\u2019s fine,\" he said. \"I\nguess you find out more about them all the time.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" admitted Harry, turning back to his table.\n\nThere was undoubtedly something a little strange about Harry\u2019s manner;\nand now Mr. Chatham realized that it had been two days since Harry had\nasked him to \"Quick, take a look!\" at the newest wonder he had\ndiscovered. With this thought teasing at his mind, the father walked\ncasually over to the table where his son sat hunched and, looking down\nat the litter of slides and papers\u2014some of which were covered with\nfigures and scribblings of which he could make nothing. He said\ndiffidently, \"How about a look?\"\n\nHarry glanced up as if startled. He was silent a moment; then he slid\nreluctantly from his chair and said, \"All right.\"\n\nMr. Chatham sat down and bent over the microscope. Puzzled and a little\nhurt, he twirled the focusing vernier and peered into the eyepiece,\nlooking down once more into the green water world of the rotifers.\n\n                                  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThere was a swarm of them under the lens, and they swam lazily to and\nfro, their cilia beating like miniature propellers. Their dark eyes\nstared, wet and glistening; they drifted in the motionless water, and\nclung with sucker-like pseudo-feet to the tangled plant stems.\n\nThen, as he almost looked away, one of them detached itself from the\ngroup and swam upward, toward him, growing larger and blurring as it\nrose out of the focus of the microscope. The last thing that remained\ndefined, before it became a shapeless gray blob and vanished, was the\ndark blotches of the great cold eyes, seeming to stare full at him\u2014cold,\nmotionless, but alive.\n\nIt was a curious experience. Henry Chatham drew suddenly back from the\neyepiece, with an involuntary shudder that he could not explain to\nhimself. He said haltingly, \"They look interesting.\"\n\n\"Sure, Dad,\" said Harry. He moved to occupy the chair again, and his\ndark young head bowed once more over the microscope. His father walked\nback across the room and sank gratefully into his arm-chair\u2014after all,\nit had been a hard day at the office. He watched Harry work the focusing\nscrews as if trying to find something, then take his pencil and begin to\nwrite quickly and impatiently.\n\nIt was with a guilty feeling of prying that, after Harry had been sent\nreluctantly to bed, Henry Chatham took a tentative look at those papers\nwhich lay in apparent disorder on his son\u2019s work table. He frowned\nuncomprehendingly at the things that were written there; it was neither\nmathematics nor language, but many of the scribblings were jumbles of\nletters and figures. It looked like code, and he remembered that less\nthan a year ago, Harry had been passionately interested in cryptography,\nand had shown what his father, at least, believed to be a considerable\naptitude for such things.... But what did cryptography have to do with\nmicroscopy, or codes with\u2014rotifers?\n\nNowhere did there seem to be a key, but there were occasional words and\nphrases jotted into the margins of some of the sheets. Mr. Chatham read\nthese, and learned nothing. \"Can\u2019t dry up, but they can,\" said one.\n\"Beds of germs,\" said another. And in the corner of one sheet, \"1\u2014Yes.\n2\u2014No.\" The only thing that looked like a translation was the note:\n\"rty34pr is the pond.\"\n\nMr. Chatham shook his head bewilderedly, replacing the sheets carefully\nas they had been. Why should Harry want to keep notes on his scientific\nhobby in code? he wondered, rationalizing even as he wondered. He went\nto bed still puzzling, but it did not keep him from sleeping, for he was\ntired.\n\nThen, only the next evening, his wife maneuvered to get him alone with\nher and burst out passionately:\n\n\"Henry, I told you that microscope was going to ruin Harry\u2019s eyesight! I\nwas watching him today when he didn\u2019t know I was watching him, and I saw\nhim winking and blinking right while he kept on looking into the thing.\nI was minded to stop him then and there, but I want you to assert _your_\nauthority with him and tell him he can\u2019t go on.\"\n\nHenry Chatham passed one nervous hand over his own aching eyes. He asked\nmildly, \"Are you sure it wasn\u2019t just your imagination, Sally? After all,\na person blinks quite normally, you know.\"\n\n\"It was not my imagination!\" snapped Mrs. Chatham. \"I know the symptoms\nof eyestrain when I see them, I guess. You\u2019ll have to stop Harry using\nthat thing so much, or else be prepared to buy him glasses.\"\n\n\"All right, Sally,\" said Mr. Chatham wearily. \"I\u2019ll see if I can\u2019t\npersuade him to be a little more moderate.\"\n\nHe went slowly into the living-room. At the moment, Harry was not using\nthe microscope; instead, he seemed to be studying one of his cryptic\npages of notes. As his father entered, he looked up sharply and swiftly\nlaid the sheet down\u2014face down.\n\nPerhaps it wasn\u2019t all Sally\u2019s imagination; the boy did look nervous, and\nthere was a drawn, white look to his thin young face. His father said\ngently, \"Harry, Mother tells me she saw you blinking, as if your eyes\nwere tired, when you were looking into the microscope today. You know if\nyou look too much, it can be a strain on your sight.\"\n\nHarry nodded quickly, too quickly, perhaps. \"Yes, Dad,\" he said. \"I read\nthat in the book. It says there that if you close the eye you\u2019re looking\nwith for a little while, it rests you and your eyes don\u2019t get tired. So\nI was practising that this afternoon. Mother must have been watching me\nthen, and got the wrong idea.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Henry Chatham. \"Well, it\u2019s good that you\u2019re trying to be\ncareful. But you\u2019ve got your mother worried, and that\u2019s not so good. I\nwish, myself, that you wouldn\u2019t spend all your time with the microscope.\nDon\u2019t you ever play baseball with the fellows any more?\"\n\n\"I haven\u2019t got time,\" said the boy, with a curious stubborn twist to his\nmouth. \"I can\u2019t right now, Dad.\" He glanced toward the microscope.\n\n\"Your rotifers won\u2019t die if you leave them alone for a while. And if\nthey do, there\u2019ll always be a new crop.\"\n\n\"But I\u2019d lose track of them,\" said Harry strangely. \"Their lives are so\nshort\u2014they live so awfully fast. You don\u2019t know how fast they live.\"\n\n\"I\u2019ve seen them,\" answered his father. \"I guess they\u2019re fast, all\nright.\" He did not know quite what to make of it all, so he settled\nhimself in his chair with his paper.\n\nBut that night, after Harry had gone later than usual to bed, he stirred\nhimself to take down the book that dealt with life in pond-water. There\nwas a memory pricking at his mind; the memory of the water beetle, which\nHarry had killed because, he said, he was eating the rotifers and their\neggs. And the boy had said he had found that fact in the book.\n\nMr. Chatham turned through the book; he read, with aching eyes, all that\nit said about rotifers. He searched for information on the beetle, and\nfound there was a whole family of whirligig beetles. There was some\nmaterial here on the characteristics and habits of the Gyrinidae, but\nnowhere did it mention the devouring of rotifers or their eggs among\ntheir customs.\n\nHe tried the topical index, but there was no help there.\n\nHarry must have lied, thought his father with a whirling head. But why,\nwhy in God\u2019s name should he say he\u2019d looked a thing up in the book when\nhe must have found it out for himself, the hard way? There was no sense\nin it. He went back to the book, convinced that, sleepy as he was, he\nmust have missed a point. The information simply wasn\u2019t there.\n\nHe got to his feet and crossed the room to Harry\u2019s work table; he\nswitched on the light over it and stood looking down at the pages of\nmystic notations. There were more pages now, quite a few. But none of\nthem seemed to mean anything. The earlier pictures of rotifers which\nHarry had drawn had given way entirely to mysterious figures.\n\nThen the simple explanation occurred to him, and he switched off the\nlight with a deep feeling of relief. Harry hadn\u2019t really _known_ that\nthe water beetle ate rotifers; he had just suspected it. And, with his\nboy\u2019s respect for fair play, he had hesitated to admit that he had\nexecuted the beetle merely on suspicion.\n\nThat didn\u2019t take the lie away, but it removed the mystery at least.\n\n                                  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHenry Chatham slept badly that night and dreamed distorted dreams. But\nwhen the alarm clock shrilled in the gray of morning, jarring him awake,\nthe dream in which he had been immersed skittered away to the back of\nhis mind, out of knowing, and sat there leering at him with strange,\ndark, glistening eyes.\n\nHe dressed, washed the flat morning taste out of his mouth with coffee,\nand took his way to his train and the ten-minute ride into the city. On\nthe way there, instead of snatching a look at the morning paper, he sat\nstill in his seat, head bowed, trying to recapture the dream whose\nvanishing made him uneasy. He was superstitious about dreams in an\nup-to-date way, believing them not warnings from some Beyond outside\nhimself, but from a subsconscious more knowing than the waking conscious\nmind.\n\nDuring the morning his work went slowly, for he kept pausing, sometimes\nin the midst of totalling a column of figures, to grasp at some mocking\nhalf-memory of that dream. At last, elbows on his desk, staring\nunseeingly at the clock on the wall, in the midst of the subdued murmur\nof the office, his mind went back to Harry, dark head bowed motionless\nover the barrel of his microscope, looking, always looking into the pale\ngreen water-gardens and the unseen lives of the beings that....\n\nAll at once it came to him, the dream he had dreamed. _He_ had been\nbending over the microscope, _he_ had been looking into the unseen\nworld, and the horror of what he had seen gripped him now and brought\nout the chill sweat on his body.\n\nFor he had seen his son there in the clouded water, among the twisted\nglassy plants, his face turned upward and eyes wide in the agonized\nappeal of the drowning; and bubbles rising, fading. But around him had\nbeen a swarm of the weird creatures, and they had been dragging him\ndown, down, blurring out of focus, and their great dark eyes glistening\nwetly, coldly....\n\nHe was sitting rigid at his desk, his work forgotten; all at once he saw\nthe clock and noticed with a start that it was already eleven a.m. A\nfear he could not define seized on him, and his hand reached\nspasmodically for the telephone on his desk.\n\nBut before he touched it, it began ringing.\n\nAfter a moment\u2019s paralysis, he picked up the receiver. It was his wife\u2019s\nvoice that came shrilly over the wires.\n\n\"Henry!\" she cried. \"Is that you?\"\n\n\"Hello, Sally,\" he said with stiff lips. Her voice as she answered\nseemed to come nearer and go farther away, and he realized that his hand\nholding the instrument was shaking.\n\n\"Henry, you\u2019ve got to come home right now. Harry\u2019s sick. He\u2019s got a high\nfever, and he\u2019s been asking for you.\"\n\nHe moistened his lips and said, \"I\u2019ll be right home. I\u2019ll take a taxi.\"\n\n\"Hurry!\" she exclaimed. \"He\u2019s been saying queer things. I think he\u2019s\ndelirious.\" She paused, and added, \"And it\u2019s all the fault of that\nmicroscope _you_ bought him!\"\n\n\"I\u2019ll be right home,\" he repeated dully.\n\n                                  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHis wife was not at the door to meet him; she must be upstairs, in\nHarry\u2019s bedroom. He paused in the living room and glanced toward the\ntable that bore the microscope; the black, gleaming thing still stood\nthere, but he did not see any of the slides, and the papers were piled\nneatly together to one side. His eyes fell on the fish bowl; it was\nempty, clean and shining. He knew Harry hadn\u2019t done those things; that\nwas Sally\u2019s neatness.\n\nAbruptly, instead of going straight up the stairs, he moved to the table\nand looked down at the pile of papers. The one on top was almost blank;\non it was written several times: rty34pr ... rty34pr.... His memory for\nfigure combinations served him; he remembered what had been written on\nanother page: \"rty34pr is the pond.\"\n\nThat made him think of the pond, lying quiescent under its green scum\nand trailing plants at the end of the garden. A step on the stair jerked\nhim around.\n\nIt was his wife, of course. She said in a voice sharp-edged with\napprehension: \"What are you doing down here? Harry wants you. The doctor\nhasn\u2019t come; I phoned him just before I called you, but he hasn\u2019t come.\"\n\nHe did not answer. Instead he gestured at the pile of papers, the empty\nfish bowl, an imperative question in his face.\n\n\"I threw that dirty water back in the pond. It\u2019s probably what he caught\nsomething from. And he was breaking himself down, humping over that\nthing. It\u2019s _your_ fault, for getting it for him. Are you coming?\" She\nglared coldly at him, turning back to the stairway.\n\n\"I\u2019m coming,\" he said heavily, and followed her upstairs.\n\nHarry lay back in his bed, a low mound under the covers. His head was\npropped against a single pillow, and his eyes were half-closed, the lids\nswollen-looking, his face hotly flushed. He was breathing slowly as if\nasleep.\n\nBut as his father entered the room, he opened his eyes as if with an\neffort, fixed them on him, said, \"Dad ... I\u2019ve got to tell you.\"\n\nMr. Chatham took the chair by the bedside, quietly, leaving his wife to\nstand. He asked, \"About what, Harry?\"\n\n\"About\u2014things.\" The boy\u2019s eyes shifted to his mother, at the foot of his\nbed. \"I don\u2019t want to talk to her. _She_ thinks it\u2019s just fever. But\nyou\u2019ll understand.\"\n\nHenry Chatham lifted his gaze to meet his wife\u2019s. \"Maybe you\u2019d better go\ndownstairs and wait for the doctor, Sally.\"\n\nShe looked hard at him, then turned abruptly to go out. \"All right,\" she\nsaid in a thin voice, and closed the door softly behind her.\n\n\"Now what did you want to tell me, Harry?\"\n\n\"About _them_ ... the rotifers,\" the boy said. His eyes had drifted\nhalf-shut again but his voice was clear. \"They did it to me ... on\npurpose.\"\n\n\"Did _what_?\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t know.... They used one of their cultures. They\u2019ve got all\nkinds: beds of germs, under the leaves in the water. They\u2019ve been\ngrowing new kinds, that will be worse than anything that ever was\nbefore.... They live so fast, they work so fast.\"\n\nHenry Chatham was silent, leaning forward beside the bed.\n\n\"It was only a little while, before I found out they knew about me. I\ncould see them through my microscope, but they could see me too.... And\nthey kept signaling, swimming and turning.... I won\u2019t tell you how to\ntalk to them, because nobody ought to talk to them ever again. Because\nthey find out more than they tell.... They know about us, now, and they\nhate us. They never knew before\u2014that there was anybody but them.... So\nthey want to kill us all.\"\n\n\"But why should they want to do that?\" asked the father, as gently as he\ncould. He kept telling himself, \"He\u2019s delirious. It\u2019s like Sally says,\nhe\u2019s been wearing himself out, thinking too much about\u2014the rotifers. But\nthe doctor will be here pretty soon, the doctor will know what to do.\"\n\n\"They don\u2019t like knowing that they aren\u2019t the only ones on Earth that\ncan think. I expect people would be the same way.\"\n\n\"But they\u2019re such little things, Harry. They can\u2019t hurt us at all.\"\n\nThe boy\u2019s eyes opened wide, shadowed with terror and fever. \"I told you,\nDad\u2014They\u2019re growing germs, millions and billions of them, _new_ ones....\nAnd they kept telling me to take them back to the pond, so they could\ntell all the rest, and they could all start getting ready\u2014for war.\"\n\nHe remembered the shapes that swam and crept in the green water gardens,\nwith whirling cilia and great, cold, glistening eyes. And he remembered\nthe clean, empty fish bowl in the window downstairs.\n\n\"Don\u2019t let them, Dad,\" said Harry convulsively. \"You\u2019ve got to kill them\nall. The ones here and the ones in the pond. You\u2019ve got to kill them\ngood\u2014because they don\u2019t mind being killed, and they lay lots of eggs,\nand their eggs can stand almost anything, even drying up. _And the eggs\nremember what the old ones knew._\"\n\n\"Don\u2019t worry,\" said Henry Chatham quickly. He grasped his son\u2019s hand, a\nhot limp hand that had slipped from under the coverlet. \"We\u2019ll stop\nthem. We\u2019ll drain the pond.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s swell,\" whispered the boy, his energy fading again. \"I ought to\nhave told you before, Dad\u2014but first I was afraid you\u2019d laugh, and then\u2014I\nwas just ... afraid....\"\n\nHis voice drifted away. And his father, looking down at the flushed\nface, saw that he seemed asleep. Well, that was better than the sick\ndelirium\u2014saying such strange, wild things\u2014\n\nDownstairs the doctor was saying harshly, \"All right. All right. But\nlet\u2019s have a look at the patient.\"\n\nHenry Chatham came quietly downstairs; he greeted the doctor briefly,\nand did not follow him to Harry\u2019s bedroom.\n\nWhen he was left alone in the room, he went to the window and stood\nlooking down at the microscope. He could not rid his head of\nstrangeness: A window between two worlds, our world and that of the\ninfinitely small, a window that looks both ways.\n\nAfter a time, he went through the kitchen and let himself out the back\ndoor, into the noonday sunlight.\n\nHe followed the garden path, between the weed-grown beds of vegetables,\nuntil he came to the edge of the little pond. It lay there quiet in the\nsunlight, green-scummed and walled with stiff rank grass, a lone\ndragonfly swooping and wheeling above it. The image of all the stagnant\nwaters, the fertile breeding-places of strange life, with which it was\njoined in the end by the tortuous hidden channels, the oozing pores of\nthe Earth.\n\nAnd it seemed to him then that he glimpsed something, a hitherto unseen\nmiasma, rising above the pool and darkening the sunlight ever so little.\nA dream, a shadow\u2014the shadow of the alien dream of things hidden in\nsmallness, the dark dream of the rotifers.\n\nThe dragonfly, having seized a bright-winged fly that was sporting over\nthe pond, descended heavily through the sunlit air and came to rest on a\nbroad lily pad. Henry Chatham was suddenly afraid. He turned and walked\nslowly, wearily, up the path toward the house.\n\n\n                                 *END*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
