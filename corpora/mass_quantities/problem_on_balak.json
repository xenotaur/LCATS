It never gets dull--and\nin some pretty strange places, at that.\n\nTake the _S.E.2100's_ discovery of Balak, which is a little planet\ncircling 70 Ophiuchi some 20,000 light-years from Earth, for example.\nYou'd never expect to run across the greatest race of surgeons in the\nGalaxy--structural, neural or what have you--on a little apple like\nthat, any more than you'd expect a four man complement like ours to be\nhanded the sort of life-and-death problem they put to us.\n\nAnd, if by some miracle of prophecy you anticipated both, it's a cinch\nyou'd never expect that problem to be solved in the way ours was.\n\n\n\nCaptain Corelli and Gibbons and I couldn't have gone more than a hundred\nyards from the _S.E.2100_ before we met our first Balakian native. Or,\nto be more accurate, before he met us.\n\nCorelli and I were filling our little sterilized bottles with samples of\nsoil and vegetation and keeping a wary eye out for possible predators\nwhen it happened. Gibbons, our ecologist and the scientific mainspring\nof our crew, was watching a swarm of little twelve-legged bugs that were\nbusily pollinating a dwarf shrub at the top and collecting payment in\ndrops of white sap that oozed out at the bottom in return. His eyes were\nshining behind their spectacles, and he was swearing to himself in a\npleased monotone.\n\n\"Signal the ship and tell the Quack--if you can pry that hypochondriac\nidiot away from his gargles and germicide sprays--to bring out a\nlive-specimen container,\" he called to Captain Corelli. \"We've stumbled\nonto something really new here, a conscious symbiosis between entirely\ndissimilar life-forms! If the rest of the flora and fauna cooperate like\nthis....\"\n\nAt the moment, Gibbons' discovery didn't register, because it was just\nthen that the first Balakian showed himself.\n\nThe native looked at first glance something like a wrinkled pink\noctopus, standing three feet high and nearly as broad, and he walked in\na skip-a-step swing like a man on crutches because his three short legs\nwere set in a horizontal row. He had four arms to each side, the lower\nones meant for grasping and holding and the upper ones for manipulation.\nHe didn't have a head, exactly, but there was a face of sorts up near\nthe top of the body that looked like nothing so much as a politely\ngrinning Oriental's.\n\nHe wasn't armed, but I took no chances--I dropped my specimen kit and\nyanked out the heat-gun that is a part of every S.E. field operative's\ngear. Captain Corelli, who was on the point of calling the Quack at the\nship, took his thumb off the mike button and grabbed for his own\nweapon. Gibbons, like a true scientist, stood by with his mouth open,\ntoo interested to be scared.\n\nThen the Balakian spoke, and Corelli and I gaped wider than Gibbons. As\nI said before, Balak is some 20,000 light-years from Earth, and to our\nknowledge we were the first human beings ever to come within a hundred\nparsecs of the place.\n\n\"Please don't shoot, gentlemen,\" he said to us in Terran. \"My name is\nGaffa, and I assure you that I am quite friendly.\"\n\n\n\nI had to give Gibbons credit for being fast on his mental feet; he had\ntaken over before Corelli and I could get our mouths closed, and was\ntalking to the native as if this sort of thing happened every time we\nmade planetfall.\n\n\"You speak Terran fluently,\" Gibbons said. \"Or is this some sort of\ntelepathic contact that creates the illusion of oral communication?\"\n\nThe native grinned delightedly. \"The contact is oral. We learned your\nlanguage from an independent planet-hunter named Haslop, who was\nwrecked here some years ago.\"\n\nIn Solar Exploitations you learn to expect the unexpected, but to me\nthis was stretching coincidence clear out of joint. We had the latest\nzero-interval-transference drive made, and I couldn't believe that any\nindependent planet-staker could have beaten us here with outmoded\nequipment.\n\n\"A Terran?\" I asked. \"Where is he now?\"\n\n\"Coming up,\" Gaffa said. \"With my fellows.\"\n\nA couple of dozen other Balakians, looking exactly like him, bore down\non us through the dwarf shrubbery, and with them were two lanky Terrans\ndressed in loose shirt-and-drawers ensembles which obviously had been\nmade on Balak. Even at a distance the Terrans looked disturbingly alike,\nand when they got closer I could see that they were identical twins.\n\n\"You don't count so good, chum,\" I said. \"I see _two_ Terrans.\"\n\n\"Only one,\" Gaffa corrected, grinning wider. \"The other is one of us.\"\n\nI didn't believe it, of course. Corelli didn't get it, either; his eyes\nhad a glazed look, and he was shaking his head like a man with a gnat in\nhis ear.\n\nOne of the Terrans rushed up to us with tears in his eyes and his\nAdam's apple bobbing, so overcome with emotion that I was afraid he\nmight kiss us.\n\n\"I'm Ira Haslop,\" he said in a choked voice. \"I've been marooned here\nfor twenty-two eternal years, and I never thought I'd see a Terran face\nagain. And now--\"\n\nHe stopped, but not for breath. The other skinny Terran had grabbed his\narm and swung him around.\n\n\"What the hell do you think you're doing, you masquerading nightmare?\"\nthe second one yelled. \"_I'm_ Ira Haslop, and you damn well know it! If\nyou think you're going to pass yourself off as me and go home to Earth\nin my place....\"\n\nThe first Haslop gaped at him for a moment; then he slapped the other's\nhand off his arm and shook a bony fist in his face.\n\n\"So that's your game! That's why these grinning freaks made you look\nlike me and threw us together all these years--they've planned all along\nto ring in a switch and send you home instead of me! Well, it won't\nwork!\"\n\n\n\nThe second Haslop swung on him then and the two of them went to the mat\nlike a pair of loose-drawered tigers, cursing and gouging. The grinning\nnatives separated them after a moment and examined them carefully for\ndamage, chattering away with great satisfaction in their own language.\n\nCorelli and Gibbons and I stared at each other like three fools. It was\nimpossible to think that either of the two men could be anything but\nwhat he claimed to be, a perfectly normal and thoroughly angry Terran;\nbut when each of them swore that one of them--the other one, of\ncourse--was an alien, and the natives backed up the accusation, what\nelse could we believe?\n\nGaffa, who seemed to be a sort of headman, took over and explained the\nsituation--which seemed to be an incredibly long-range gag cooked up by\nthese octopod jokers, without the original Haslop's knowledge, against\nthe day when another Terran ship might land on Balak. Their real intent,\nGaffa said, was to present us with a problem that could be solved only\nby a species with a real understanding of its own kind. If we could\nsolve it, his people stood ready to assist us in any way possible. If\nnot....\n\nI didn't like the sound of it, so I reached for my heat-gun again. So\ndid Captain Corelli and Gibbons, but we were too slow.\n\nA little stinging bug--another link in the cooperative Balakian\necology--bit each of us on the back of the neck and we passed out cold.\nWhen we woke up again, we were \"guests\" of Gaffa and his tribe in a sort\nof settlement miles from the _S.E.2100_, and there wasn't so much as a\nnail file among us in the way of weapons.\n\nThe natives hadn't bothered to shackle us or lock us up. We found\nourselves lying instead in the middle of a circular court surrounded by\nmossy mounds that looked like flattened beehives, but which were\nactually dwellings where the Balakians lived.\n\nWe learned later that the buildings were constructed by swarms of tiny\nburrowing brutes like termites, who built them up grain by grain\naccording to specifications. I can't begin to explain the principle\nbehind the harmony existing between all living things on Balak; it just\nwas, and seemed to operate like a sort of hyper-sympathy or interlocking\ntelepathy between species. Every creature on the planet performed some\nservice for some other creature--even the plants, which grew edibles\nwithout pain-nerves so it wouldn't hurt to be plucked, and which sent up\nclouds of dust-dry spores once a week to make it rain.\n\nAnd the three-legged, eight-armed natives were right at the top of this\nscrewy utopia, lords of it all.\n\nNot that any of us were interested at first in it as an ecological\nmarvel, of course. From the moment we woke up we were too busy with\nplans for escaping the trap we'd fallen into.\n\n\n\n\"The Quack is our only hope,\" Captain Corelli said, and groaned at the\nthought. \"If that hypochondriac idiot has brains enough to sit tight, we\nmay have a chance. If they get him, too, we're lost.\"\n\nThe Quack was a damned poor reed to lean on.\n\nHis name was Alvin Frick, but no one ever used it. He was twenty-nine,\nand would never have rated a space berth as anything but a hydroponics\nattendant, which is one step above manual labor. He was short, plump and\nscrubbed to the pink, and he was the only hypochondriac I ever knew in\nthis modern age of almost no sickness. He groused about the germs\nswarming in his reduction tanks, and he was scared green, in spite of\nhis permanent immunization shots, that he'd contract some nameless alien\ndisease at every planetfall. He dosed himself continuously with\nconcoctions whipped up from an old medical book he had found somewhere,\nand he spent most of his off-duty time spraying himself and his quarters\nwith disinfectant. His mania had only one good facet--if he had been the\ncareless sort, hydroponics being what it is, he'd have smelled like a\nbarnyard instead of a dispensary.\n\nWe had never made any attempt to get rid of him, since we might have\ndrawn an even worse tank-farmer, but we began to wish now that we had.\nWe had hardly begun to figure ways and means of escaping when a bunch of\ngrinning natives swung into our court and deposited the Quack, sleeping\nsoundly, in our midst.\n\nHe came to just before sundown, and when we told him what had happened,\nhe promptly passed out again--this time from fright.\n\n\"A fine lot of help _you_ are, you super-sterile slob,\" I said when he\nwoke up for the second time. I'd probably have said worse, but it was\njust then that the real squeeze began.\n\nGaffa came back with the two scowling Haslops in tow and handed us the\nproblem his tribe had spent twenty-two years in working up.\n\n\"We have learned enough already from Haslop,\" Gaffa said, \"to know\nsomething of the pressures and complexities that follow the expansion of\nyour Terran Realm through the galaxy, and to assure us that in time we\nmust either become a part of that Realm or isolate ourselves completely.\n\n\"We are a peaceful species and feel that we should probably benefit as\nmuch from your physical sciences as your people would from our\nbiological skills, but there is a question of compatibility that must be\nsettled first, before we may risk making ourselves known to Terra. So we\nhave devised a test to determine what our course shall be.\"\n\n\n\nWe raised our brows at one another over that, not guessing at the time\njust what the Balakians really had on the ball.\n\n\"For thousands of generations, we have devoted our energies to knowing\nourselves and our environment,\" Gaffa said, \"because we know that no\nspecies can be truly balanced unless it understands itself. The\nsymbiosis between all life-forms on our planet is the result of that\nknowledge. We should like to assure ourselves that you are capable of\nunderstanding your own kind as well before we offer our services to your\nTerran Realm--and therein lies the test we have arranged for you.\"\n\nCaptain Corelli drew himself up stiffly. \"I think,\" he said, \"that the\nthree of us should be able to unravel your little riddle, if you'll\ncondescend to tell us what it is.\"\n\nGaffa sent a puzzled look at the Quack, and I could see that he was\nwondering why Corelli hadn't included him in the boast. But Gaffa\ndidn't know how simple the Quack could be, nor how preoccupied with his\nown physiology he was.\n\n\"One of these two,\" said Gaffa, pointing to the two Haslops, \"is the\noriginal Ira Haslop, who was stranded here twenty-two Terran years ago.\nThe other is a synthetic creation of ours--an android, if you like, who\nis identical, cell by cell, with the original so far as exterior\nlikeness is concerned. We could not duplicate the interior without\ndissection, which of course was out of the question, so we were forced\nto make compromises that--\"\n\nGibbons interrupted him incredulously. \"You mean you've created a living\ncreature, brain and all?\"\n\n\"Only the body,\" Gaffa said. \"Creation of intelligence is still beyond\nus. The brain of the duplicate Haslop is one of our own, transplanted\nand conditioned to Haslop's knowledge, memories and ideology.\"\n\nHe paused for a moment, and the waiting circle of Balakians grinned with\nhim in anticipation.\n\n\"Your problem is this,\" Gaffa said. \"If you know yourselves well enough\nto merit our help, then you should be able to distinguish readily\nbetween the real and false Haslops. If you fail, we shall have no\nalternative but to keep you here on Balak for the rest of your lives,\nsince to release you would bring other Terrans down on us in force.\"\n\nAnd that was it. All we had to do was to take these two identical\ntwins--who looked alike, thought alike and cursed alike--and determine\nwhich was real and which was bogus.\n\n\"For a very pertinent reason which you may or may not discover,\" Gaffa\nsaid, \"the test must be limited to a few hours. You have until sunrise\ntomorrow morning, gentlemen.\"\n\nAnd with that he crutched away at his skip-a-step walk, taking his\ngrinning cohorts with him. The two Haslops remained behind, glowering\nand grumbling at each other.\n\n\n\nThe situation didn't look too bad at first.\n\n\"There are no two things,\" Captain Corelli declared, \"that are exactly\nand absolutely identical. And that applies, I should say, especially to\nidentities.\"\n\nIt had a heartening sound. I've never been long on logic, being a very\nordinary S.E. navigator whose automatic equipment is designed to do\npractically everything for him, and Corelli seemed to know what he was\ntalking about.\n\nGibbons, being a scientist, saw it differently.\n\n\"That's not even good sophistry,\" he said. \"The concept of identity\nbetween two objects has no meaning whatever, Captain, unless we have a\nprior identification of one or the other. Aristotle himself couldn't\nhave told an apple from a coconut if he'd never seen or heard of\neither.\"\n\n\"Any fool would know that,\" one of the Haslops grunted. And the other\nadded in the same tone: \"Hey, if you guys are going at it like that,\nwe'll be here forever!\"\n\n\"All right,\" Corelli said, deflated. \"We'll try another tack.\"\n\nHe thought for a minute or two. \"How about screening them for background\ndetail? The real Haslop was a bounty-claimer, which means that he must\nhave made thousands of planetfalls before crashing here. The bogus one\ncouldn't remember the details of all those worlds as well as the\noriginal, no matter how many times he'd been told, could he?\"\n\n\"Won't work,\" one of the Haslops said disgustedly. \"Hell, after\ntwenty-two years I can't remember those places myself, and I was\n_there_.\"\n\nThe other Haslop gave him a dirty look. \"You were _here_, fellow--_I_\nwas _there_.\"\n\nAnd to the captain he said, \"We're getting nowhere, friend. You're\nunderestimating these Balakians--they look and act like screwballs, but\nthey're sharp. In the twenty-two years I've lived with that carbon copy\nof myself, he's learned everything I know.\"\n\n\"He's right,\" Gibbons put in. He blinked a couple of times and turned\npink. \"Unless the real Haslop happened to be married, that is. I'm a\nbachelor myself, but I'd say there are some memories that a married man\nwouldn't discuss, even when marooned.\"\n\nCaptain Corelli stared at him admiringly. \"I never gave you enough\ncredit, Gibbons,\" he said. \"You're right! How about--\"\n\n\"Don't help any,\" one of the Haslops said morosely. \"I never was\nmarried. And now I never will be if I've got to depend on you jerks to\nget me out of this mess.\"\n\nThe sun went down just then and a soft, drowsy darkness fell. I thought\nat first that we'd have to finish our investigation in the dark, but the\nnatives had made provisions for that. A swarm of fireflies as big as\nrobins sailed in from somewhere and circled around over the court,\nlighting it as bright as day. The Balakian houses made a dim row of\nflattened shadow-mounds at the outskirts of the circle. A ring of\nnatives sat tailor-fashion on the ground in front of them--a neat trick\nconsidering that they had three legs each to fold up--and grinned at us.\n\nThey had waited twenty-two years for this show, and now that it had\ncome they were enjoying every minute of it.\n\n\n\nOur investigation was pretty rough going. The fireflies overhead all\ncircled in one direction, which made you dizzy every time you looked up,\nand besides that the Quack had remembered that he was a prisoner in an\nalien environment and was at the mercy of any outlandish disease that\nmight creep past his permanent immunization. He muttered and grumbled to\nhimself about the risk, and his grousing got on our nerves even worse\nthan usual.\n\nI moved over to shut him up, and blinked when I saw him pop something\ninto his mouth. My first guess was that he had managed to sneak some\nfood concentrate out of the ship somehow, and the thought made me\nrealize how hungry I was.\n\n\"What've you got there, Quack?\" I demanded. \"Come on, give--what are you\nhiding out?\"\n\n\"Antibiotics and stuff,\" he answered, and pulled a little flat plastic\ncase out of a pocket.\n\nIt was his portable medicine chest, which he carried the way\nsuperstitious people used to carry rabbits' feet, and it was largely\nresponsible for our calling him the Quack. It was full of patent capsule\nremedies that he had gleaned out of his home medical book--a cut thumb,\na surprise headache, or a siege of gas on the stomach would never catch\nthe Quack unprepared!\n\n\"Jerk,\" I said, and went back to Gibbons and Corelli, who were arguing a\nnew approach to our problem.\n\n\"It's worth a try,\" Gibbons said. He turned on the two Haslops, who were\nbristling like a pair of strange dogs. \"This question is for the real\nHaslop: Have you ever been put through a Rorschach, thematic\napperception or free association test?\"\n\nThe real Haslop hadn't. Either of them.\n\n\"Then we'll try free association,\" Gibbons said, and explained what he\nwanted of them.\n\n\"_Water_,\" Gibbons said, popping it out quick and sharp.\n\n\"Spigot,\" the Haslops said together. Which is exactly what any spaceman\nwould say, since the only water important to him comes out of a ship's\ntank. \"Lake\" and \"river\" and \"spring,\" to him, are only words in books.\n\nGibbons chewed his lip and tried again, but the result was the same\nevery time. When he said \"payday\" they both came back \"binge,\" and when\nhe said \"man\" they answered \"woman!\" with the same gleam in their eyes.\n\n\"I could have told you it wouldn't work,\" one Haslop said when Gibbons\nthrew up his hands and quit. \"I've lived so long with that phony that\nhe even knows what I'm going to say next.\"\n\n\"I was going to say the same thing,\" the other one growled. \"After\ntwenty-two years of drinking and arguing with him, we've begun--God help\nme!--to think alike.\"\n\nI tried my own hand just once.\n\n\"Gaffa says that they are exactly identical so far as outside appearance\ngoes,\" I said. \"But he may be wrong, or lying. Maybe we'd better check\nfor ourselves.\"\n\n\n\nThe Haslops raised a howl, of course, but it did them no good. Gibbons\nand Corelli and I ganged them one at a time--the Quack refused to help\nfor fear of being contaminated--and examined them carefully. It was a\nlively job, since both of them swore they were ticklish, and under\ndifferent circumstances it could have been embarrassing.\n\nBut it settled one point. Gaffa hadn't lied. They were absolutely\nidentical, as far as we could determine.\n\nWe had given it up and were resting from our labors when Gaffa came\ngrinning out of the darkness and brought us a big crystal pitcher of\nsomething that would have passed for a first-class Planet Punch except\nthat it was nearer two-thirds alcohol than the fifty-fifty mix you get\nat most interplanetary ginmills.\n\nThe two Haslops had a slug of it as a matter of course, being accustomed\nto it, and the rest of us followed suit. Only the Quack refused, turning\ngreen at the thought of all the alien bacteria that might be swimming\naround in the pitcher.\n\nA couple of drinks made us feel better.\n\n\"I've been thinking,\" Captain Corelli said, \"about what Gaffa said when\nhe limited the time of the test, that we might or might not discover the\nreason for ourselves. Now what the hell did the grinning heathen mean by\nthat? Is there a reason, or was he only dragging a red herring across\nthe bogus Haslop's track?\"\n\nGibbons looked thoughtful. I sat back while he pondered and watched the\nQuack, who was swallowing another antibiotic capsule.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Gibbons exclaimed. \"Captain, you've hit on something\nthere!\"\n\nHe stared at the Haslops. They stared back, unimpressed.\n\n\"Gaffa said you two were exactly alike outside,\" Gibbons said. \"And\nwe've proved it. Does that mean you're not alike _inside_?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" one of them said. \"But what of it? You're sure as hell not going\nto cut one of us open to see!\"\n\n\"You're confusing the issue,\" Gibbons snapped. \"What I'm getting at is\nthis--if you two aren't made alike inside, then you can't possibly exist\non the same sort of diet. One of you eats the same sort of food as\nourselves. The other can't. But which is which?\"\n\nOne of the Haslops pointed a quivering finger at the other. \"It's him!\"\nhe said. \"I've watched him drink his dinner for twenty-two years--he's\nthe fake!\"\n\n\"Liar!\" the other one yelled, springing up. Corelli stepped between them\nand the second Haslop subsided, grumbling. \"It's true enough, only\n_he's_ the one that drinks his meals. This stuff in the pitcher is the\nfood he lives on--alcohol for energy, with minerals and other stuff\ndissolved in it. I drink it with him for kicks, but that phony can't eat\nanything else.\"\n\n\n\nCorelli snapped his fingers.\n\n\"So that's why they limited our time, and why they brought this\nstuff--to keep their fake Haslop refueled! All we've got to do to\nseparate our men now is feed them something solid. The one that eats it\nis the real Haslop.\"\n\n\"Sure, all we need now is some solid food,\" I said. \"You don't happen to\nhave a couple of sandwiches on you, do you?\"\n\nEverybody got quiet for a couple of minutes, and in the silence the\nQuack surprised us all by deciding to speak up.\n\n\"Since I'm stuck here for life,\" he said, \"a few germs more or less\nwon't matter much. Pass me the pitcher, will you?\"\n\nHe took a man-sized slug of the fiery stuff without even wiping off the\npitcher's rim.\n\nAfter that we gave it up, as who wouldn't have? Captain Corelli said the\nhell with it and took such a slug out of the pitcher that the two\nHaslops yelled murder and grabbed it quick themselves, and from then on\nwe just sat around and drank and talked and waited for the sunrise that\nwould condemn us to Balak for the rest of our lives.\n\nThinking about our problem had reminded me of an old puzzle I'd heard\nsomewhere about three men being placed in a room where they can see each\nother but not themselves; they're shown three white hats and two black\nones, and then they're blindfolded and a hat is put on each of their\nheads. When the blindfolds are taken off, the third man knows by looking\nat the other two and by what they say just what color hat he's wearing\nhimself, but I always forget how it is that he knows.\n\nWe got so interested in the hat problem that the east was turning pink\nbefore we realized it.\n\nNone of us actually saw the sun rise, though, except the Quack and the\nbogus Haslop.\n\nI was right in the middle of a sentence when all of a sudden my stomach\nrolled over and growled like a dying tiger, and I never had such an\nall-gone feeling in my life. I looked at the others, wondering if the\nstuff in the pitcher had poisoned us all, and saw Gibbons and Corelli\nstaring at each other with the same startled look in their eyes. One of\nthe Haslops was hit, too--he had the same pinched expression around the\nmouth, and perspiration stood out on his forehead in drops as big as\ngrapes.\n\nAnd then the four of us were on our feet and dashing for open country,\nleaving the Quack and the remaining Haslop staring after us. The Haslop\nwho stayed looked puzzled, I thought, but the Quack only seemed\ninterested and very much entertained.\n\nI couldn't be sure of that, though. There wasn't time to look twice.\n\n\n\nWhen we came back to the court later, shaken and pale and bracing\nourselves for another dash at any minute, we found Gaffa and his\ngrinning chums congratulating the Quack. The bogus Haslop had dropped\nhis impersonation act and seemed very happy.\n\n\"I've learned to like Haslop so well after twenty-two years,\" he said,\n\"that I'm quite prejudiced in favor of his species, and I'm delighted\nthat we are to join your Realm. Balak and Terra will get along famously,\nI know, since you people are so ingenious and appreciative of humor.\"\n\nWe ignored the Balakians and swooped down on the Quack.\n\n\"You put something in that pitcher after you drank out of it, you insult\nto humanity,\" I said. \"What was it?\"\n\nThe Quack backed off with a wary look in his eye.\n\n\"A recipe from the curiosa section of my medical book,\" he said. \"I\nwhipped up some capsules for my pocket kit, just in case of emergency,\nand I couldn't help thinking of them when--\"\n\n\"Never mind the buildup,\" Captain Corelli said. \"_What was it?_\"\n\n\"A formula invented by ancient Terran bartenders, and not recommended\nexcept in extreme cases,\" the Quack said. \"With a very odd name. It's\ncalled a twin Mickey.\"\n\nWe'd probably have murdered him then and there if the Quack's concoction\nhad let us.\n\nLater on we had to admit that the Quack had actually done us a service,\nsince his identifying the real Haslop saved us from being marooned for\nlife on Balak. And the Balakians were such an immediate sensation in the\nTerran Realm that the Quack's part in their admittance made him famous\novernight. Somebody high up in Government circles got him out of Solar\nExploitations field work and gave him a sinecure in an antibiotics\nlaboratory, where he wound up as happy as a pig in a peanut field.\n\nWhich points up the statement I made in the beginning, that one thing\nyou never have to worry about in Solar Exploitations work is being\nbored.\n\nYou see what I mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
