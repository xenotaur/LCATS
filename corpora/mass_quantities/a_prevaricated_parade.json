    "body": "\u201cAnd for the support of this A declaration, with a firm reliance on\nthe protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other\nour lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor.\u201d\n\nHank Padden shifted his seat on the top pole of the corral, and marks\nthe place with his finger.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d says he, \u201cshall I orate the names of the men who signed it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d replies old man Whittaker. \u201cWe don\u2019t know none of them,\npersonally, so we\u2019ll let what you\u2019ve already read be sufficient and\nplenty. After listening to all you\u2019ve read out of that book, Hank, I\u2019m\nof the impression that she\u2019s a fitting day to be celebrated. What do\nyou think, Hen?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s worth a passing memorial,\u201d says I, and \u201cScenery\u201d Sims, the\nfourth member of our committee, nods his head:\n\n\u201cShe sure is, gents. I never cared for kings, except in jack-pots, and\nour glorious forefathers sure did proclaim their feelings. I\u2019m with\nyuh from the hondo to the saddle-horn.\u201d\n\nThat makes it unanimous. The night before there\u2019s a meeting in\nParadise, and they appoints me and Scenery, Hank Padden and old man\nWhittaker as a committee to investigate the reasons and so forth of\nthe Fourth of July, and whether, in our own minds, she\u2019s of sufficient\nimport to consider a celebration.\n\nWe finds that she is. Hank Padden reads us the reasons out of a\ndictionary, while we sets there on the corral top, at the Cross J.\n\nOld man Whittaker owns the Cross J, Hank Padden the Seven A, and\nScenery Sims is the possessor of the Circle S outfit and the\nsqueakiest voice ever anchored in the throat of a human being. Every\ntime I hears Scenery start to talk I pray for cylinder oil or\nchloroform. Me? I\u2019m Henry Clay Peck. I work for old man Whittaker. I\nain\u2019t got nothing but a conscience, a heap of respect for the truth\nand the feeling that I lowers myself when I punches cows.\n\nWe has just arrived at our conclusion when \u201cMuley\u201d Bowles saunters\ndown to the corral, climbs up beside us and bends our seat all to\npieces. We four moves to the next section for safety. Muley weighs so\nmuch that he has to bandage his bronc\u2019s legs with splints to keep it\nfrom being bowlegged. The world lost a cracking good poet when Muley\nessayed to punch cows. He don\u2019t look the part, not having soulful eyes\nnor emaciated ribs, but when it comes to making up poetry he\u2019s got \u2019em\nall lashed to the snubbing-post.\n\n\u201cHas the committee arrived at a satisfactory conclusion?\u201d he asks,\npuffing hard on his cigaret, and shaking out a new rope.\n\n\u201cWhen the facts is made public we\u2019ll let yuh know with the rest,\u201d\nsqueaks Scenery, who dislikes Muley a heap.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s talking to you?\u201d demands Muley. \u201cScenery, you takes too much\nupon yourself. I been thinking of a sweet little rhyme what sounds\nlike this, and I gives yuh three guesses who I mean:\n\n    \u201cHe had a squeaky little voice,\n    A skinny little frame.\n    He lived in God\u2019s own country,\n    But the country wa\u2019n\u2019t to blame.\n    Comparing him with growed-up men,\n    Who rode the Sawtooth Hills,\n    He looked like a pewter nickel\n    In a bunch of green-back bills.\u201d\n\n\u201cYah-h-h-h!\u201d shrills Scenery. \u201cYou\u2019re sore \u2019cause you wasn\u2019t elected\nto the committee. Lard!\u201d\n\nScenery puts all the venom in his system into that last word, and at\nthe finish his voice would have split a cigaret paper. As he makes his\ngreasy statement his right boot snaps up to horizontal, and Muley\u2019s\nloop gets him around the ankle.\n\nIt sure was one beautiful and speedy piece of rope work, and the next\nminute Scenery is on his shoulders in the corral, with his right foot\nsnubbed high and handsome to the top of a corral post.\n\nMuley lights his cigaret and climbs down the other side.\n\n\u201cThe committee will have to turn him loose,\u201d he states. \u201cI won\u2019t\npollute my hands by touching him. I reckon the acid in his measly\nlittle carcass will ruin that metal hondo before he gets loose, but\nit\u2019s worth it.\u201d\n\nMuley peers through the poles of the corral and grins at Scenery.\n\n\u201cNext time yuh opines to speak of a byproduct of your family, Scenery,\ndon\u2019t look at me,\u201d he states.\n\nOur nerves are rasped considerable before we gets Scenery calmed down,\nbut we finally pacifies him, and all sets in judgment on the Fourth of\nJuly again.\n\n\u201cNow that we\u2019ve decided to celebrate\u2014how\u2019ll we do it?\u201d asks Hank. \u201cShe\nought to be did befitting the solemnity of the occasion, hadn\u2019t it,\nWhittaker?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe deserves it,\u201d agrees the old man. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a salute at\nsunrise, won\u2019t we? Then what\u2019ll we do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got to have a pe-rade,\u201d squeaks Scenery. \u201cThem is necessary\nadjunct to celebrations. I was down to Cottonwood last Fourth, and\nthey sure had a humdinger of a pe-rade. Had a feller all dressed up in\na fancy hat and a sash, riding in front, and then comes a lot of\ndress-up wagons, what they designates as floats. They has a beautiful\ngal all dressed up to imitate Miss Columbus, and\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s she?\u201d asks Hank.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know who Columbus was?\u201d asked Scenery, and Hank nods.\n\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t ask fool questions then,\u201d squeaks Scenery. \u201cThey has\nhoss-races, foot-races and\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have nothing that we can\u2019t have,\u201d pronounces Hank.\n\n\u201cWe can have all that. I\u2019ll ride at the head of the pe-rade and\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t unanimous,\u201d interrupts Scenery. \u201cWhy you any more than me,\nHank? Next thing we know you\u2019ll want to be Miss Columbus.\u201d\n\n\u201cHang on to yourselves,\u201d advises Whittaker. \u201cYou fellers elects\nyourselves to everything\u2014seems to me. A leading man in a pe-rade ought\nto dress the part, I reckon. When I lives in Great Falls I\u2019m elected\nas a ornery member of a organization. It had something to do about\nwoodcraft, and we dresses up like a plush hoss, when we meets. I still\ngot my war-bonnet and pants left. Some son of a gun stole the coat. I\nstill got my ax, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou still got the ax?\u201d squeaks Scenery. \u201cWonderful! Go home and cut\nsome wood. I think your fire\u2019s out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile you old spavs are fighting for honors, what\u2019s the matter with\nconsidering me?\u201d I asks. \u201cYou\u2019re all so danged old and stove-up that\nyou\u2019d have to lead it in a lumber-wagon. Look at me, and step back in\nthe ranks. I\u2019m young, handsome\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPause!\u201d yelps Scenery. \u201cPause, Hen. It takes brains to lead a\npe-rade.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen let\u2019s not quarrel,\u201d says I. \u201cWe ain\u2019t eligible. Let\u2019s settle\nthese little details later and in a place what ain\u2019t so dry. It won\u2019t\nbe the Fourth of July until day after tomorrow, so let\u2019s adjourn.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey agrees. Scenery and Hank goes home, and I goes up to the\nbunk-house, where \u201cTelescope\u201d Tolliver and Muley are playing pitch.\n\n\u201cHen, what has the committee decided to do?\u201d askes Telescope.\n\nI tells him what our plans are, so far, and while I\u2019m telling in comes\n\u201cChuck\u201d Warner, the prize liar of Yaller Rock County. Chuck punches\ncows with us for a living, and carries the greatest assortment of\nprevarications on earth as a side-line. I been with him so long that\nat times I shades the truth a little, too.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t all lead the pe-rade, that\u2019s a cinch,\u201d states Chuck. \u201cI\nseen a pe-rade down to New York one time that\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou never was in New York,\u201d states Telescope.\n\n\u201cI was born there,\u201d declares Chuck, wiggling his ears.\n\n\u201cIn Pima County, Arizona,\u201d says Telescope. \u201cI know when, too, Chuck.\u201d\n\n\u201cDates don\u2019t count, Telescope. I said I was born in New York, and it\u2019s\nmy business if I wants to stick to my statement. Now, Telescope, if\nyou said you was born in a teepee on a Digger reservation I wouldn\u2019t\nargue with you for a minute. I\u2019d take it as Gospel. A feller has a\nright to a birthplace, and I takes New York.\u201d\n\nThat argument shows Chuck Warner in his native state. He\u2019s got a face\nlike a bronc, shortest legs on earth, and can wiggle his ears like a\nburro. The only time he can\u2019t look yuh square in the eye is when he\u2019s\ntelling the truth.\n\n\u201cYuh ought to get somebody with a little style to lead that pe-rade,\nHen,\u201d opines Muley.\n\n\u201cMight get \u2018Pole Cat\u2019 Perkins or \u2018Harelip\u2019 Hansen,\u201d laughs Telescope.\n\u201cHave Harelip ride one of his goats, and have Pole Cat walk slow\nbehind him, leading a skunk. Have the goat wear the old man\u2019s striped\npants, and put Scenery\u2019s hat on the skunk.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou fellers ought to be on the committee,\u201d says I, sarcastic-like.\n\u201cYuh might get up your own pe-rade.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good scheme,\u201d agrees Chuck. \u201cWe\u2019ll form a offensive and\ndefensive alliance.\u201d\n\n\u201cOffensive is right,\u201d says I, and then I goes up to see the old man.\n\nThe next morning me and the old man goes to Paradise, and goes into\nexecutive session, with Scenery and Hank, in the rear of Dug Chaffin\u2019s\nsaloon. Hank pounds on the table with his boot heel, and calls the\nroll. We\u2019re all present.\n\n\u201cGents,\u201d asks Hank, \u201cwho is going to lead the pe-rade?\u201d\n\nWe looks at each other, and then the old man clears his throat.\n\n\u201cI looked up them lodge raiment, and they\u2019re dazzlers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still got that hard hat that I wore to a Dimmicrat rally down to\nSilver Bend ten year ago,\u201d orates Scenery. \u201cShe looks a heap\ndignified, and it\u2019s too small for any of you fellers. I got a sword,\ntoo\u2014in a holster.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo lead a pe-rade a man ought to look dignified\u2014not his clothes,\u201d\nproclaims Hank.\n\n\u201cThis here glory thing is going to cause hard feelings,\u201d says I. \u201cI\nmoves that we does like this: we\u2019ll all be here before the pe-rade is\nready to start, and we\u2019ll let some uninterested party pick out the\nsuitable person for to lead it. Dress for the part, and if yuh don\u2019t\nget picked, be a good sport and pe-rade anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll keep the mortality down to a certain extent,\u201d agrees Hank,\nand the other two nods.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d says Hank, \u201chow about this person to be Miss Columbus?\u201d\n\n\u201cI got her picked,\u201d states Scenery. \u201cI nominates Miss Eulalie McFee.\u201d\n\n\u201cSheriff\u2019s daughter, eh?\u201d laughs Hank. \u201cShe\u2019s so danged thin that if\nshe stood edge-ways yuh couldn\u2019t see her, Scenery. I nominates Miss\nMaggie Smith, niece of \u2018Doughgod\u2019 Smith. Who seconds the motion?\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Columbus ought to be a danged sight better-looking than Maggie\nSmith,\u201d states the old man. \u201cWho ever heard of Miss Columbus with\ncrossed eyes and freckles? I marks X at the top of my ticket for Miss\nClarice Chaffin, daughter of Dug. Do I hear an agreeable voice?\u201d\n\n\u201cHaw! Haw!\u201d roars Hank. \u201cClarice Chaffin! This contest ain\u2019t for no\nanimated flag-pole, Whittaker. How\u2019s your sentiments, Hen?\u201d\n\n\u201cI leans toward Mrs. Genevieve Saunders, widder of the late \u2018Slim\u2019\nSaunders. She\u2019d fill the part.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be danged small if she didn\u2019t,\u201d Scenery. \u201cShe weighs at\nleast two hundred and\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cScenery,\u201d says I, \u201csome day I\u2019m going to hang a pebble on your neck,\nthrow yuh into a tin cup of water and drown yuh.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s vote on it,\u201d suggests Hank.\n\n\u201cIt don\u2019t require no vote,\u201d replies Whittaker. \u201cIf Hen wants to drown\nScenery I\u2019m\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean vote on the lady!\u201d snaps Hank. We did. We each cast a vote for\nour choice, and it starts a argument that\u2019s a humdinger, and before we\nleaves the council-chamber we\u2019re mentally wallering in each other\u2019s\ngore.\n\nParadise is busy fixing up floats and decorations, and we\u2019re asked a\nlot of questions that we don\u2019t dare to answer.\n\n\u201cWho is going to lead the pe-rade?\u201d whispers Doughgod to me, and I\nwhispers back\u2014\n\n\u201cI am.\u201d\n\nHe toilers me for a distance, and whispers once more\u2014\n\n\u201cHen, who is going to be Miss Columbus?\u201d I answers\u2014\n\n\u201cThe widder Saunders.\u201d\n\n\u201cHank told me that my niece, Maggie was going to be her.\u201d\n\n\u201cHank\u2019s a liar,\u201d says I, and Doughgod nods, and walks away.\n\nI\u2019m over at the rack, cinching up my saddle, when here comes Dug\nChaffin.\n\n\u201cHenry, I\u2019m looking for information that I can\u2019t seem to get from any\nof your cohorts. Who is due to be Miss Columbus tomorrow?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe widder Saunders. That\u2019s settled, Dug.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know that old man Whittaker is a liar?\u201d he asks, and I nods.\n\u201cYes, he\u2019s a liar,\u201d declares Dug. \u201cHe said he\u2019d stick for Clarice\n\u2019till hell froze over.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe got cold feet,\u201d says I, and Dug goes back to his palace of sin, in\na unhappy mood.\n\nI gets on my bronc and points toward the Cross J. I\u2019m sick of being on\na committee, and having to hurt people\u2019s feelings.\n\nParadise ain\u2019t no safe place to cause discord in. There\u2019s a sentiment\nin that place that leans towards shooting first and asking questions\nafterwards. There\u2019s only one thing the whole place will agree on, and\nthat is this: yuh can\u2019t have a royal flush if your opponent has four\nkings.\n\n\u201cStuttering\u201d Stevens thought he\u2019d establish a precedent by holding one\nagainst kings and sevens in one hand and kings and eights in another.\nThe coroner said that either shot would have been fatal. Stuttering\nmust a been guilty, \u2019cause no man would steal kings to make up two\npair.\n\nI hammers my bronc along down to where the Cross J road forks with the\none from Silver Bend, when I hears a peculiar noise. Sounds to me like\na threshing machine with St. Vitus dance. My bronc shows signs of\nnervousness, so I gets off. Pretty soon it comes in sight, and I\nrecognizes it as being an autymobile, the same of which ain\u2019t been in\nthis country since the one belonging to Scenery Sims runs over some\ndynamite at Piperock and evaporates.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy bronc drags me off into the mesquite for a ways, until I can get my\nrope around a bush and stop him, and then I pilgrims back to the road.\nAt first I don\u2019t recognize the inhabitant of that carriage. I looks\nhim over, careful-like, and then he grins and betrays himself. It\u2019s\nold \u201cCalamity\u201d Carson. I ain\u2019t seen him for five years, and I shakes\nhis hand industrious-like. After we gets through pumping elbows I\nleans back and surveys his equipage.\n\n\u201cSome vehicle, eh, Henry?\u201d he says, with a dusty grin. \u201cSurprised to\nsee me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, not exactly, Calamity. We been expecting yuh.\u201d\n\n\u201cExpecting me?\u201d he wonders aloud. \u201cI suppose \u2018Tellurium\u2019 had to go and\ntell everybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d I agrees. \u201cTellurium Woods never could keep still.\u201d\n\nSo far as I know Tellurium ain\u2019t been in Paradise for six months, but\nhe\u2019s as good as anybody to blame it on. Him and Calamity used to be\npardners.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d says Calamity, brushing the dust off his mustache, and\ngiving his cigaret a chance to burn hair freely. \u201cHere I been figuring\non surprising the old-timers, and I been told upon by a friend. Henry\nPeck, I done sold out my property over in the Little Rockies, and now\nI\u2019m rich.\n\n\u201cI got more money than a dog has fleas, but I ain\u2019t enjoyed it none. I\nopines to throw a surprise into Paradise, so I buys this gasoline\nbuckboard, has her shipped to Silver Bend, and here I am. She\u2019s worse\nthan any outlaw bronc that ever flinched under a saddle, Henry, and\nI\u2019m older by years and years than I was a week ago when a man teached\nme how to drive it. I don\u2019t know what makes her run. All I got to do\nis put gasoline in her, twist her tail a few times, pull the\ndesignated levers, and point her away from the stumps. She sure makes\nenough noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou figured the tune right, Calamity,\u201d says I. \u201cParadise sure is\ndoing itself proud in your honor.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018In my honor?\u2019 What\u2019s the idea, Henry?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yuh see it ain\u2019t often that a town can have a former inhabitant\ncome home rich and distinguished like you are. The public sure admires\na man with a chunk off the root of all evil, Calamity. We\u2019ve decorated\nin your honor, and tomorrow we parades before yuh to show our\nadmiration and respect. Sabe?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy gosh, Henry!\u201d he snorts. \u201cThis is too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s considerable, Calamity, but look who you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a fact, Henry\u2014it sure is. Well, well!\u201d\n\nHe sets there, with a far-away look in his eyes, and that cigaret\nsizzling on his mustache, and sudden-like he reaches under the seat\nand hauls out a jug.\n\n\u201cHenry Peck, I been saving this for my old friends\u2014Tellurium,\nDoughgod, \u2018Half Mike\u2019 Smith, et cettry, but you qualifies, Henry. Your\noration sure puts joy into my old heart. Go as deep as yuh like.\u201d\n\nI sets there in his gas go-devil, and we swears allegiance to each\nother. We celebrates our new-found friendship, and regales each other\nwith anecdotes. I tells him all the neighborhood gossip, and we toast\neach and every one. He tells me about his property in the Little\nRockies, and we drinks a toast to all the little rocks.\n\nMy bronc gets the rope loose, and passes us on his way home. We toasts\nthe Cross J and my pinto.\n\n\u201cWho did yuh say was going to lead the pe-rade in my honor?\u201d asks\nCalamity.\n\n\u201cI am. Being your best friend, Calamity, I\u2019m eligible. I\u2019ll ride that\npinto bronc at the head end of that great conglomeration. How\u2019d yuh\nlike that, old-timer?\u201d\n\n\u201cI got a better idea,\u201d says he, solemn-like. \u201cI\u2019ll teach yuh how to\nrun this here contraption, and you lead her in this. How\u2019d yuh like to\ndo that, Henry?\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds to me like the voice of angels. What yuh packing in them two\ncans in the rear?\u201d\n\n\u201cGasoline. Twenty gallons I shipped with the car. All yuh got to do is\nto twist that front crank until she starts humming. Sabe? Then yuh get\nin and let this here brake loose. You get out and give her a twist,\nHenry. That\u2019s the first lesson.\u201d\n\nI falls out and ambles around to the front. I grasps the crank in both\nhands, gives it a man-sized yank, slips with both feet, and that\njuggernaut runs right across my floating ribs. She sure squashes me a\nplenty, and I don\u2019t more than start to get up when here she comes\nright back to run over me again. Calamity stops her just in time.\n\n\u201cYou forgot the e-mergency,\u201d observes Calamity, scared-like, over the\nback of the seat.\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d says I. \u201cI forgot my name and address, too, if that\u2019s\nanything to snort over. What are yuh supposed to do\u2014put her against a\nrock to start her?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a simple thing, Hen.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, so is a stick uh dynamite,\u201d says I, rubbing the kinks out of my\nhide. \u201cLet\u2019s not call school right now, Calamity. We\u2019ll go up to the\nCross J, where prying eyes can see us not, and there yuh can show me\nall things. Anyway yuh don\u2019t want to show up in Paradise today.\nEverybody is busy getting things ready, and if you was to go down\nthere now they\u2019d drop everything. Sabe?\u201d\n\n\u201cPopularity warmeth my cold heart,\u201d says he. \u201cBeing of the committee,\nHenry Peck, I bows to superior wisdom. We\u2019ll proceed to the old Cross\nJ, and take a lesson.\u201d\n\nWe stops at the Seeping Springs and has a nice drink\u2014out of the jug.\nWe starts out merrily along the road, when all to once Calamity starts\nto tell me a story. Calamity must have French blood in his carcass,\n\u2019cause he talks with his hands.\n\nAt least he might a picked out a flat place to do his gestures in, but\nas it was we hops off the road, down a hill, and pokes the front end\nof that machine into a mesquite bush. What part of it didn\u2019t plow\nthrough the bush jumped over.\n\nI untangles myself from the brush and wanders over to the wagon. She\ndon\u2019t seem hurt much, but her heart has quit beating.\n\n\u201c_Hyas cultus chuck, chick_,\u201d states a voice, and I turns to\nsee old Running Wolf, a Piegan, squatting on his haunches, looking at\nthat machine.\n\nHe\u2019s got a look on his face that Columbus might a had when he first\nsaw the shores of our fair country.\n\n\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d asks a weak voice, and Calamity appears from the\nother side of the car.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018It\u2019s a mighty bad wagon,\u2019\u201d I interprets, and Calamity nods\nhis head:\n\n\u201cThat Injun ain\u2019t no danged idiot, Henry. Wonder if he\u2019d like to take\na ride?\u201d\n\n\u201c_Mesika klatawa kopa chick, chick?_\u201d I asks, but the old\nredskin puts his thumb up to his nose and wiggles his fingers at us.\n\n\u201cNah-h-h-h-h!\u201d he gargles, and points at his moccasins.\n\nWe manages to get that wagon back on the road. We drinks a toast to\nour good luck and to honest and cautious Injuns, and plods on up to\nthe Cross J. I reckon our toasts covers too much territory, \u2019cause\nwhen Calamity opines to have me read his book of rules, all I can do\nis sing.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt\u2019s almost dark when I wakes up. Beside me on the bunk is Calamity,\nsnoring like a shepherd, so I sticks my boot into his ribs.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d says he, after a look around. \u201cThanks, Henry. I was having a\nautymobilemare.\u201d\n\nJust then in comes old man Whittaker. He looks around, sort of\nmad-like, and glares at me and Calamity.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t seem to be here\u2014gol dingle dangle it!\u201d he yelps.\n\nMe and Calamity looks around and shakes our heads.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d says I. \u201cThey must a left.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey never went alone!\u201d he howls. \u201cThat fancy, lodge war-bonnet and\nthem striped pants never went away alone. I reckon I got to kill\nsomebody!\u201d\n\nHe slams the door, as he goes out, and Calamity looks at me.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with him?\u201d he asks. \u201cHe never recognized me, and\nI\u2019ve knowed Whittaker for years and years.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrazy,\u201d says I. \u201cHe went crazy over fancy clothes. He don\u2019t know\nanybody any more, Calamity.\u201d\n\n\u201cPshaw! I knowed he wasn\u2019t\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nWe hears a voice at the door, and I yells, \u201cCome in!\u201d and in ambles\nPole Cat Perkins. He\u2019s got a bundle under his arm, and he sets down on\nthe bunk and grins at me and Calamity.\n\n\u201cHuh-Hen, I\u2019m after your permission,\u201d says he.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got it, Pole Cat. What yuh going to do with it?\u201d\n\nHe unrolls that bundle and produces a yaller stove-pipe hat, dented\nand moth-eaten, and an old rusty sword. He balances that old hat on\nhis ball-shaped head, and runs the sword along the palm of his left\nhand.\n\n\u201cDo I qualify, Mister Peck?\u201d he asks.\n\n\u201cFor certain places, Pole Cat. What\u2019s the idea?\u201d\n\n\u201cChuck gives me these habiliments and tells me that I\u2019ll have to get\nyour permission to lead the pe-rade tomorrow. I admires the chance so\nmuch that I ain\u2019t lost no time in coming. Do I get it?\u201d\n\n\u201cPole Cat,\u201d says I, solemn-like, \u201cyou probably will. Let your judgment\nbe your guiding star.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Henry. I bids yuh good afternoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter make it farewell,\u201d says I.\n\n\u201cLoco crop must be flourishing up here,\u201d observes Calamity. \u201cSome\nsmells worse than others, Henry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis one is named after his associates,\u201d says I, and just then\nsomebody rides up to the door and I hears Harelip Hansen\u2019s voice. \u201cGet\nbehind the bunk!\u201d I hisses at Calamity. \u201cIf Harelip sees you up here\nhe never will leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowdy, Henry,\u201d says Harelip. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see yuh.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased to know that the sight of me makes folks glad,\u201d says I.\n\u201cWhat yuh got on your mind and under your arm?\u201d\n\nHe unrolls enough for me to see that he\u2019s got Whittaker\u2019s lodge\nclothes.\n\n\u201cChuck told me I could wear these at the front end of that pe-rade\ntomorrow, but I\u2019d have to see you first.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do yuh reckon to have me do\u2014dress yuh?\u201d I asks, and he grins all\nover his homely face.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be all right, will it?\u201d he asks, and I nods and replies:\n\n\u201cYou know best, Harelip. There\u2019s a divinity that shapes our ends.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh. I gives you thanks, Henry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take \u2019em, Harelip,\u201d says I. \u201cI may never have any use for them,\nbut it will be something to remember yuh by, old trailer.\u201d\n\nI watches him climb on his flea-bitten cayuse, and jog off down the\nroad. Calamity is looking over my shoulder, and as Harelip drifts out\nof sight he yelps:\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my autymobile, Henry? We left her right out there didn\u2019t we?\u201d\n\nWe goes out and looks around. There\u2019s the tracks we made when we came\nin, and there\u2019s the tracks where it went out, and back down the road.\nCalamity scratches his head, and hitches up his pants.\n\n\u201cHenry,\u201d says he, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. What yuh going to lead that pe-rade in\nnow?\u201d\n\nI simply shakes my head, and says to myself:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a well-led pe-rade. She\u2019s already got two front\nends.\u201d\n\n\u201cHenry,\u201d says Calamity, pointing at the dust, \u201cthey just missed that\ngate-post as they goes out and they didn\u2019t get on to the road for a\nhundred yards. I\u2019d opine that they ain\u2019t familiar with the thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas there anything left under the seat?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cOne two-gallon jug, Henry\u2014and what was left in ours.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is much to look forward to, Calamity,\u201d says I. \u201cMaybe we better\ntake a shovel along. I hope they don\u2019t bust up your machine.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let that molest your heart strings, Henry. I been thinking for\nseveral days thay maybe she\u2019s going to be a fatal fad. Of course it\u2019s\ngoing to spoil my entry into Paradise. A person of my financial\nstanding hadn\u2019t ought to enter his old home town except in a fitting\nequipage. Ain\u2019t I right, Henry?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says I, \u201csince the old man left with his buckskin team and\nrattle wagon, and some heartless hombre has turned loose every bronc\non the place, there ain\u2019t no mode of locomotion in sight except them\ntwo burros up there at the cook-shack. Are yuh too proud to straddle a\njackass, Calamity?\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll soon be dark, Henry. Many a man has done things in the dark\nthat he wouldn\u2019t do in the light. Let\u2019s equip the shameful things and\nbe on our way.\u201d\n\nWe puts saddles on them long-eared things and pilgrims off down the\nroad in the dusty dusk. When we comes opposite the Saunders place, I\npulls up.\n\n\u201cWhow,\u201d says I. \u201cI got a mission to perform. We got to have a Miss\nColumbus for your pe-rade, Calamity, and I got to bear her the news.\u201d\n\nWe goes up and knocks on her door, and informs her of the fact.\n\n\u201cMy gosh, Henry!\u201d says she. \u201cI ain\u2019t got nothing to wear!\u201d\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d says Calamity, bowing low, \u201cdon\u2019t you let that worry yuh. A\nfigure like yours don\u2019t need no clothes.\u201d\n\nThe door shuts off the conversation, and we wanders back to our trusty\nsteeds.\n\n\u201cCalamity, you been a lot of help to me this evening,\u201d says I. \u201cYou\nsure cut our cinch with the widder Saunders.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m prostrated with grief,\u201d orates the old pelican. \u201cAnyway I don\u2019t\nsee what Columbus has to do with my homecoming, Henry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain it to yuh, Calamity. You\u2019d have to see it for\nyourself.\u201d\n\nWe pilgrims down to Paradise, and ties our steeds on a side street.\nThere\u2019s a scarcity of rolling stock in sight, and it makes me wonder a\nheap. Usually yuh can see broncs tied all over town, when a\ncelebration is in prospect.\n\nWe pokes along up the street to Mike Pelly\u2019s saloon and goes inside.\nMike is alone in there, setting at the end of the bar, with a shotgun\nbeside him.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Paradise?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cCivilization,\u201d says Mike.\n\n\u201cAre we welcome?\u201d asks Calamity, taking in the attitude of Mike, and\nsizing up the place.\n\n\u201cYou are,\u201d replies Mike. \u201cThis place is neutral. I\u2019d advise you to get\nout of line with that window. The town is divided against itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat causes the divisions?\u201d I asks, taking Mike\u2019s advice.\n\nMike bites off a fresh chew and settles back in his chair.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201cNumerous and sundry things, Henry. Old man Whittaker is setting up\nthere in Henderson\u2019s barbershop, with a Winchester, swearing he\u2019s\ngoing to perforate Harelip Hansen, who is across the street in Dug\nChaffin\u2019s corral, nursing a peeled nose and a six-shooter. The old man\nswears that Harelip stole his clothes.\n\n\u201cPole Cat Perkins is behind my place here, trying to jam some lead\ninto Scenery Sims before Scenery can slip some to him. It seems that\ntheir trouble grows out of a clothes controversy, too. Pole Cat avers\nthat he\u2019s going to slit Scenery with a rusty sword.\n\n\u201cDoughgod Smith seems to be seeking Hank Padden\u2019s gore over something\nabout Columbus\u2019 daughter, and Dug Chaffin\u2019s got the same thing against\nold man Whittaker and orates his intentions of puncturing the old\nman\u2019s hide for prevarication. Bill McFee refuses to arrest anybody\nexcept Scenery Sims, and his feelings seem some rasped over this same\nColumbus thing. Who in \u2014\u2014 is Miss Columbus, Henry?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t, eh?\u201d laughs Mike. \u201cThe \u2014\u2014 yuh don\u2019t! You sure ought to,\nHenry. Yuh sent notes to both of the Mudgett sisters, to Hulda\nPeterson, cook at the Triangle, Annie Schmidt, at the Seven A, and to\nMrs. \u2018Breezy\u2019 Benson, asking \u2019em to fill the part. Every one of them\nhas been down here looking for you today. According to what I can find\nout there can\u2019t more than one be it, and that seems to cause a heap of\ndissatisfaction, Henry. Abe Mudgett and Breezy was here today, and\nthey are wishful to see yuh.\u201d\n\n\u201cHenry,\u201d says Calamity, \u201cyou\u2019ve overdone your duty.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would look thataway to a innocent bystander,\u201d I agrees. \u201cWhere\u2019s\nall the broncs, Mike? Did everybody walk in today?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the civilization part comes in. A autymobile invades our\nfair city today, and she swept us clean of hossflesh. Out on them\nracks is fifteen pieces of rope flopping in the breeze. Old man\nWhittaker\u2019s buckskin team was in the lead the last we seen of the\nrace. That\u2019s why nobody is leaving. They\u2019d rather be shot at than\nwalk.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho had the autymobile?\u201d asks Calamity.\n\n\u201cNobody knows. It went too fast for us to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cHoo, hoo!\u201d comes a voice from outside, and we all ducks. \u201cHoo, hoo!\u201d\nshe comes again, and then we hears a female voice, \u201cIs Mister Peck in\nthere?\u201d\n\n\u201cGo out and see who it is,\u201d I whispers to Mike, but he shakes his\nhead:\n\n\u201cNot me. She wants you, Henry.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe can take it out in wanting. I don\u2019t take no chances. You go out,\nCalamity. Nobody\u2019s got a thing against you.\u201d\n\nCalamity thinks it over, and then goes out all humped like he was\nsuffering from kidney disease. Me and Mike lays low, and pretty soon\nCalamity comes sneaking back.\n\n\u201cIt was that female person we went up to see,\u201d he states. \u201cShe wishes\nto forgive me, and wants me to tell you that she\u2019ll take up your\noffer, Henry. She\u2019ll be Miss Columbus.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother victim,\u201d grunts Mike. \u201cYou\u2019re a bigger liar than Chuck\nWarner.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe done it for me,\u201d defends Calamity. \u201cHenry wanted to make my\nhomecoming a complete success, and it ain\u2019t all his fault if it don\u2019t\nexactly work out. When a man has a pe-rade given in his honor he can\u2019t\nkick if some of the details do get a little balled up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn your honor?\u201d wonders Mike, out loud. \u201cAre you Fourth of July,\nMister?\u201d\n\n\u201cFourth of July?\u201d Calamity looks at me and Mike, and then seems to dig\ndeep-like into his memory for buried information.\n\nWhile he seems to check off some numbers on his fingers, I edges\ntoward the back door. He nods, sort of agreeable-like, chaws one side\nof his mustache, and fingers his waistline, where his gun makes a\nbulge.\n\n\u201cFourth of July,\u201d he mutters. \u201cUh-huh. That\u2019s right. Henry Peck told\nme\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nI opens the door, easy-like, and misses the rest of the complaint.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d says I to me, \u201cyou\u2019re branded as a liar, Henry Peck. The best\nthing you can do is to get your little jackass and go home. Your\nforefathers never fought for glorious freedom, so there ain\u2019t no use\nof you celebrating the happy event. The men who were responsible for\nthe Pecks\u2019 family tree was all hung for lying and stealing long before\nthe Declaration of Independence was signed.\u201d\n\nWith these few cheering words ringing in my windpipe I ambles around\nthe corner, and down to where we left them burros. I gets there just\nin time. Scenery Sims is untying one of my trusty animiles, so I\nquickens my pace and shoves a gun in his ribs.\n\n\u201cUnhand that charger!\u201d I roars in his ear, and Scenery wilts against\nthe hitch-rack. \u201cYou danged burro thief!\u201d I hisses. \u201cIf you wants to\nlead that pe-rade\u2014go get your own rolling stock.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2014I dud-don\u2019t want to le-lead nothing but the sus-simple life,\u201d he\nstutters. \u201cI want to go home, Henry. Pup-Pole Cat shot the back out of\nmy suspenders, and stuck a bullet into the cylinder of my gun so she\nwon\u2019t work. I\u2019m through, Hen. You lead it.\u201d\n\nHere comes somebody down the street toward us, puffing like a bronc\nwith the heaves. He lopes up to us, sticks his heels into the ground\nand skids around to the opposite side of the burros. It is old man\nWhittaker.\n\n\u201cQuick!\u201d he pants. \u201cI\u2019m rushed to death.\u201d\n\nThen he begins to fuss with a tie rope.\n\n\u201cIs speed essential?\u201d I asks, and he snorts. \u201cYou know it is! I\u2019m out\nof shells\u2014got more at the ranch. Dang the man what tied this rope!\u201d\n\nJust then somebody fires a shot up the street and I don\u2019t hesitate. I\nhops on to that Rocky Mountain canary, sets my spurs into his hide,\nand down the street we goes, frog-hopping, high, wide and handsome. A\nbullet plows under my steed, and he sails out of Paradise faster than\nany burro ever did before or since.\n\nWe keep up that speed for about a mile, and then slows down to a\namble. I know where a pack-trail leaves the main road, a mile or so\nabove where the road does, so I opines to take the shortest route to\nthe Cross J. I leads my animile, while I searches for the trail in the\ndark, and all to once I hears voices down the road. I hears Muley\u2019s\nbass and Chuck\u2019s baritone, a cross between a greaseless wheel and\npneumonia, raised in song\u2014\n\n\u201c\u2018It was at Aunt Dinah\u2019s quilting partee-e-e-e\u2014\u2014\u2019\u201d\n\nThen Telescope\u2019s tenor rings in\u2014\n\n\u201c\u2018I was see-e-e-e-e-eing Nellie-e-e-e-e home.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cTha\u2019s harmonee,\u201d I hears Chuck opine. \u201cLe\u2019s all shing \u2018Holy City.\u2019\n\u2018Lash night as I lay sheeping\u2019\u2014shay, Teleschope, why don\u2019t this\nmachine go on, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do I know,\u201d replies Telescope. \u201cShomebody light \u2019nother match so\nI can read the reashon in the little book.\u201d\n\n\u201cAw, who cares?\u201d asks Muley. \u201cLet\u2019s have more cheer\u2014listen:\n\n    \u201cI love a little lager beer,\n    I love a little wine;\n    A little bit a alcohol\n    Makes my heart feel fine.\n    But when I want a reg\u2019lar drink,\n    To make my feelings hug,\n    I take a little snifter\n    From the old brown jug.\u201d\n\nI sets there and listens to that kind of a conversation for a while.\nThey tries to sing another song, but she don\u2019t finish, and after a\nwhile I wanders down and looks \u2019em over.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nChuck is in the bottom of the machine, with his boots hanging over the\ndashboard, while Telescope is doubled up in the seat, with his feet on\nChuck\u2019s head. Muley is on the ground, with his head through a space in\na front wheel, where some spokes are missing, and he\u2019s snoring by\nnote.\n\nI rolls him away from the machine. I gives Telescope a gentle shove,\nhangs on to his leg so he won\u2019t hit too hard and deposits him along\nwith Muley. Chuck is wedged in there pretty tight, and when I opines\nto loosen him a little he orates something about wanting his maw to\nwake him up, \u2019cause he\u2019s going to be queen of the May. I never did\nlike to ride alone, so I lets him stay. It pains me to see the flower\nof young manhood in the gutter of alcohol thataway. I finds the jug,\nand am glad to see that part of it is still there.\n\nI drinks what would measure about three inches in a wash-tub, before I\nremembers how Calamity runs that machine, but all to once she comes\nback to me. I sets that brake, gives her a mighty twist, and away she\ngoes, _whirrup, whirrup, whirrup, zuz, zuz, zuz, zuz_.\n\nI\u2019ve rode a lot of broncs that didn\u2019t sabe the meaning of a bit, but\nthat thing was less bridlewise than anything I ever seen. We grinds\nback toward Paradise, smelling of burnt grease, gasoline and so forth.\nI takes another look into that jug, and feels so elevated that I puts\nmy feet over the dashboard. Somehow that seems to give the critter\nmore freedom, and we goes faster.\n\nI gets so expert right away that I can drive one-handed, and I\ndiscovers a little jigger on the handle that will make her prick up\nher ears at a touch. I gives her a few touches, and marvels at how\nfast the mesquite goes past, when all to once I hears a yelp, and we\nhits something or somebody, and when I stops I\u2019m cross ways of the\nroad.\n\nMy machine is as dead as a nail. Pretty soon I hears a rustling noise\nin the dark, and then old man Whittaker\u2019s voice:\n\n\u201cWho run into me? Gol dingle dang yuh! Blasted mule couldn\u2019t run\nfaster than I could! Hey, you feller with a autymobile! Ain\u2019t yuh got\nno sense? Gol dang your soul, I\u2019ll show yuh how yuh can run me down!\n_Bang!_\u201d\n\nHe cut loose with that six-gun, and I drops out the other side and\nsneaks behind a tree.\n\nI hears the old man cussing some more, and pretty soon he finds the\nmachine and strikes a match. He has to light the second one before he\nfinds what he\u2019s looking for. He holds the match above his head for a\nminute and then wails:\n\n\u201cGol dang yuh, Chuck! Why didn\u2019t yuh speak? Aw \u2014\u2014! Chuckie, where did\nI hit yuh? Can\u2019t yuh speak to a feller? Are yuh dead? My \u2014\u2014!\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s silent for a spell, and then he starts again:\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s that danged slow-footed mule? Here yuh are, yuh long-eared\nsnail! Got to get a doctor. Self-defense\u2014nope, accident. Whoa! Maybe\nhis neck is broke, too. Aw, this ain\u2019t no way to celebrate nohow.\u201d\n\nHe pilgrims off up the road, complaining about everything and cussing\nthat mule for taking him all over the State instead of straight to the\nCross J. I\u2019d opine that the old man was so excited that he\u2019d taken the\nwrong road out of town.\n\nI hauls the front end of that machine around again, and winds her up.\nIf that front end hadn\u2019t been against a rock my obituary would have\nbeen written right there in the dusty road, \u2019cause she\u2019s wide open,\nwith no brake set. She\u2019s backing and filling when I hops aboard, and\nwe begins our merry ride once more.\n\nI rubs my heel on Chuck\u2019s ear and yells:\n\n\u201cChuck, you\u2019re dead! Old man Whittaker shot yuh.\u201d\n\n\u201cTha\u2019s good,\u201d he replies. \u201cSame to you and many of \u2019em.\u201d\n\nWe runs slow-like to Paradise, and I bumps the front end of the\nmachine into McFee\u2019s corral to stop her. I gives Chuck an alcoholic\nanesthetic, and leaves him there. I ambles over to the town, and finds\na crowd in front of Mike\u2019s place. I moves up closer and hears the\nconversation.\n\n\u201cIt was deplorable,\u201d I hears old man Whittaker state, with tears in\nhis voice. \u201cI loved Chuck like he was my own son. It was a accident,\nBill\u2014just accidental. You don\u2019t think I\u2019d kill him with malice\naforethought, do yuh, Bill?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can tell better what yuh killed him with after we sees the\nre-mains,\u201d replies Bill. \u201cI can\u2019t help jailing yuh, Whit. It\u2019s the\nlaw. If you\u2019re innocent, yuh ain\u2019t got nothing to fear. I got Scenery\nSims down there now, so yuh won\u2019t get lonesome.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did Scenery do?\u201d asks the old man.\n\n\u201cDisturbed the peace. This place is law-abiding, if yuh asks me. Just\nfor the looks of the thing we\u2019ll take Doc Milliken along, while we\ngets your victim\u2019s body. Where did yuh say this here dastardly deed\nwas done?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t dastardly!\u201d whoops the old man. \u201cIt was accidental, I tell\nyuh! It happens near where the old pack-trail leaves the main road.\nYou know where that is?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. Wait a minute, fellers, and I\u2019ll be with yuh.\u201d\n\nHe takes the old man and goes off down toward the jail, and when he\ncomes back they all gets in that wagon and rattles off down the road.\nThe old man must a been rattled, \u2019cause it happens a long ways this\nside of the pack-trail end. That\u2019s where I leaves Muley and Telescope.\n\nMike and Calamity stands there on the porch as the wagon leaves, and I\nhears Mike yell at Bill:\n\n\u201cHey, Bill! Be sure and get back before sunrise on account of them\nsalutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat salutes is them?\u201d asks Calamity.\n\n\u201cBill\u2019s got \u2019em down in the jail. He\u2019s got five ten-gallon kerosene\ncans full of water down there, and in each can is six sticks of\ndynamite, wrapped in canvas and covered with axle-grease. They\u2019re all\nready to touch off. Some salute, eh? Now, if Bill\u2019s late we won\u2019t have\nour sunrise salute.\u201d\n\nThey goes back inside. I looks at my watch, and sees that it\u2019s danged\nnear morning, and at the same time I gets a happy idea. I ambles back\nto the autymobile, and finds Chuck setting on the seat, holding his\nhead in his hands.\n\n\u201cHenry,\u201d says he, \u201chow came I here, and why am I so dry?\u201d\n\n\u201cI brought yuh here, Chuck, and I hid the jug under the wagon.\u201d\n\nI gives him a shock and he gets enthusiastic.\n\n\u201cChuck,\u201d says I, \u201cwould yuh like to hear a big, big noise?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the idea, Henry\u2014a great big noise. Can\u2019t be too big. Where yuh\ngoing to get it?\u201d\n\nI tells him about them loaded cans down at the jail, and he\u2019s for me.\nWe enthuses over the jug a little more, and then goes down to the\njail. I posts Chuck about a hundred feet from the jail, and tells him\nto watch for anybody coming from town.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Paradise jail ain\u2019t much. It\u2019s one story, mostly dobe, and stands\nway out from any other shack, a grim reminder that there still is law\nand order\u2014at times. A strong man might kick the walls loose if they\nwasn\u2019t afraid the roof would fall on \u2019em. I takes a rock and busts the\npadlock. There\u2019s only one cell in the place, and when I lights a match\nI sees the faces of Scenery Sims and the old man.\n\nI busts the lock off the cell door, and lets \u2019em out.\n\n\u201cVamoose!\u201d I whispers. \u201cGet a-going. We don\u2019t want no lynching in\nParadise on the Fourth of July.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, Henry\u2014\u201d squeaks Scenery.\n\n\u201cNo time for argument!\u201d I snaps. \u201cYou\u2019ll find out later. Go fast and\nfar. Sabe?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make this right with you, Henry,\u201d says the old man,\nearnest-like, and I nods in the dark and says to myself\u2014\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll likely try.\u201d\n\nThey slips out together, and in about a minute I hears Chuck come up\nto the door, and he seems peevish over something.\n\n\u201cHen!\u201d he whispers. \u201cAw, Hen! Henry Peck!\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t say nothing, and pretty soon he remarks, sad-like:\n\n\u201cDrunk. Saw two Henry Pecks go away from here. Must be drunk as a\nboiled owl.\u201d\n\nHe goes out of hearing, complaining to himself about the effects of\nalcohol on the optic nerves.\n\nI takes the dynamite out of them cans and puts it in one pile on the\nfloor. Bill must a been afraid of that stuff, \u2019cause he\u2019s got about\nten minutes\u2019 worth of extra fuse.\n\nI runs the fuse out the door, puts the padlock back in place, and\ntouches her off. I goes back up to Mike\u2019s place but don\u2019t go in. Mike\nand Calamity are playing cards, while they waits for Chuck\u2019s body to\narrive, so I goes over and climbs up on the hitch-rack. I gets up\nthere, and gets right down. Comes a rumble and a shake, the town is\nlit up for a second, and then it begins to rain pieces of jail all\nover town. Thirty sticks of dynamite is some little dwelling-mover.\n\nMike and Calamity staggers out on the porch, and gazes at the world.\n\n\u201cWhat do yuh reckon it was?\u201d gasps Calamity.\n\n\u201cDynamite!\u201d yells Mike. \u201cThere\u2019s \u2014\u2014 to pay and no pitch hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cBill McFee insisted on leaving that stuff in the jail until it was\ntime to touch it off, and he done put old man Whittaker and Scenery\nSims in there\u2014and\u2014they both smoke!\u201d\n\n\u201cGosh all hemlock!\u201d wails Calamity. \u201cThere ain\u2019t a thing we can do, is\nthere, Mike?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing. When you\u2019re near thirty sticks of dynamite, and she goes\noff, there ain\u2019t nothing that anybody can do\u2014not even the coroner.\u201d\n\nThey don\u2019t much more than get inside, when I hears the rattle of\nwheels, and into Paradise comes the ambulance. They swings around in\nfront of the place and stops. Out comes Mike and Calamity.\n\n\u201cWas he dead?\u201d asks Mike, and we hears McFee snort:\n\n\u201cOld man Whittaker must be crazy! We couldn\u2019t find Chuck nor the\nautymobile. All we found was Muley and Telescope, setting along the\nroad trying to sing. They don\u2019t know about no shooting scrape.\nWhittaker is a danged old liar!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t speak disrespectable of the dead,\u201d advises Calamity. \u201cNo matter\nhow a man acted in this vale of tears yuh hadn\u2019t ought to besmirch his\nmemory with recriminations.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe ain\u2019t dead, I tell yuh!\u201d yelps Bill. \u201cWell,\u201d says Mike, \u201cif he\nain\u2019t he\u2019s made of iron. No man can stand a shock like that and ever\nbe the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cShock? Who do yuh mean\u2014Chuck?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Mike, sad-like. \u201cI mean Whittaker.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Scenery Sims,\u201d adds Calamity, removing his hat. \u201cThey must a\nthrew a match on to a fuse. The padlock came through the back door,\nand is sticking in Mike\u2019s bar.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s complete silence for a while, and then McFee gasps\u2014\n\n\u201cMy \u2014\u2014!\u201d\n\nHe yanks the team around, and away he goes, rattlety bang, down toward\nthe jail, while the crowd races along behind him. Muley and Telescope\nsets there on the steps and finishes up their song.\n\n\u201cRet-ret-retribution,\u201d pronounces Telescope. \u201cThe old man kills Chuck,\nand then gets hoist with his own petard.\u201d\n\n\u201cHoisted,\u201d corrects Muley. \u201cI never heard dynamite called petard but a\nrose by any other name would smell as sweet. Some celebration, eh,\nTelescope. I wonder if anybody has yet killed Henry Peck this fair\nmorning?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe day is yet young, so why worry?\u201d says Telescope. \u201cI fain wouldst\nlook upon the red when it is wine. Let\u2019s tend a little bar, Muley.\u201d\n\nI wanders around back of Mike\u2019s place. I feels weary, and when I\nnotices Mike\u2019s little barn, I gets an inspiration. Why not sleep until\ncelebration time? I climbs into the loft and sprawls on the hay.\n\n\u201cAll the comforts of home,\u201d says I out loud.\n\n\u201cHey, Henry,\u201d comes a whisper. \u201cWas Chuck dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d says I. \u201cIs Scenery with yuh?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is,\u201d squeaks Scenery. \u201cWhat was that explosion, Henry?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey say that Harelip and Pole Cat blew up the jail. I don\u2019t know how\nmuch truth there is in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHenry,\u201d quavers the old man, \u201cyou was a friend in need. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\n\nJust then a faint voice begins singing, somewhere in the hay. It\u2019s a\nvoice that nobody ever heard and forgot. Cross between a greaseless\nwheel and pneumonia.\n\n\u201c\u2018Rockuhvages clef\u2019 for me-e-e, le\u2019 me hide myself\u2014\u2014\u2019\u201d\n\nWe listens for a few seconds. Old man Whittaker gathers his legs under\nhimself like a rabbit, and shoots out a that hay-loft like a swaller.\nWe hears him hit the ground and gallop out of range. Scenery don\u2019t say\na word. He yawns, crawls over to the window, and lets himself down,\neasy-like, and sneaks away.\n\n\u201cHenry,\u201d says Chuck, \u201cdid I hear your voice?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop talking to yourself, you shepherd, and let a man sleep. I had a\nawful dream, Henry. Dreamed that the world blowed up. It hit me\nand\u2014ho, hum-m-m!\u201d\n\n\u201cHo, hum-m-m-m!\u201d says I, and goes to sleep, too.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I woke up the birds were singing, and the sun was shining through\nthe cracks in the loft. Chuck is still snoring, so I climbs down\nalone. I\u2019m as dry as a drouth in Arizona, so I pilgrims into Mike\u2019s\nplace regardless of consequences.\n\nThe place is fairly filled, and sadness is the prevailing color\nscheme. On the bar stands Scenery\u2019s old stove-pipe hat, with a wide\nband of black cloth around it, and Mike\u2019s mirror is hung with the\nemblem of mourning.\n\nMcFee is standing there with bowed head, and sadness fairly drips from\nhis lips.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a most awful situation,\u201d he orates. \u201cIf we could only find a\nsingle piece of \u2019em. There ain\u2019t nothing left\u2014nothing!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere ain\u2019t nothing left of poor Chuck either,\u201d tolls Muley. \u201cPoor\nold Chuck. He was a gentleman and a scholar. I\u2019d love to gaze upon his\nface once more.\n\n    \u201cHe\u2019s went away and left us\n        In the prime of his young life.\n    He\u2019s gone from this here vale of tears\n        With all it\u2019s joy and strife.\n    No more we\u2019ll see his banty legs,\n        Nor hear him tell a lie.\n    He\u2019s vanished from old Paradise,\n        And we never said good-by.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a mighty pretty thing, Muley,\u201d applauds Pole Cat. \u201cCan\u2019t yuh\nthink of something nice to say for old man Whittaker?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rest of you fellers stand back from Pole Cat and Harelip, and old\nman Whittaker will say something for himself,\u201d states a voice at the\ndoor, and there stands the old man, with a shotgun which he levels at\nPole Cat and Harelip.\n\nThe crowd obeys. Bill McFee\u2019s legs get so weak that he sets down on\nthe bar-rail where he gasps like a fish out of water.\n\n\u201cYou danged pair of dynamiters!\u201d snaps the old man. \u201cWith the shadder\nof the gallows staring me in the eye, and Chuck Warner\u2019s ghost\nhaunting my dreams, I comes back to show yuh that your dastardly deed\nfailed. When yuh blowed up that jail yuh didn\u2019t get me and Scenery.\nSabe? Shut up!\u201d he snaps, as Harelip starts to say something. \u201cDon\u2019t\ntry to deny it, Harelip. I can prove it by the heero what let us out.\nThere he stands, gents. Henry Clay Peck. He busted the lock and\nliberated\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nThe crowd turns to look at me, but I don\u2019t seem to be the point of\ninterest at that. They looks right past me. Old man Whittaker\u2019s gun\nslips from his hands, and clangs on the floor. I twists my neck and\nlooks behind me, and there stands Chuck. He yawns and leans against\nthe pool-table.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says Chuck, in a dry voice, \u201cain\u2019t somebody going to set \u2019em\nup? Sleeping in timothy makes a feller dry.\u201d\n\nBill McFee looks at Chuck and back at Whittaker and the tears of joy\nruns out of his eyes. Whittaker leans against the door and tries to\nlaugh, but he can\u2019t.\n\n\u201cHaw!\u201d says Harelip, but that\u2019s as far as he got.\n\nChuck ambles up to the bar, and looks \u2019em over.\n\n\u201cHoly henhawks!\u201d he snorts. \u201cHave yuh all gone loco?\u201d\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t\u2014ain\u2019t yuh dead, Chuck?\u201d stutters the old man.\n\n\u201cAlmost\u2014from thirst.\u201d\n\nBill McFee has been looking, steady-like, at me for some time, and\nwhen he gets on his feet he sort of starts edging toward me. I edges\nthe other way, sort of unconcerned-like, and bumps into Calamity. He\u2019s\ngot a billiard cue in his hands.\n\n\u201cHenry,\u201d he whispers, \u201cyou lied to me.\u201d\n\nI nods, kicks his feet out from under him, and goes out of that back\ndoor like a shot. I races around to the front, and runs into\nsomething. They\u2019re grouped, and I\u2019m into \u2019em before I has time to\nthink.\n\nThere\u2019s the two Mudgett sisters, Hulda Peterson, Annie Schmidt, Mrs.\nBenson, Maggie Smith, Clarice Chaffin and the widder Saunders. The\nmale members of the vigilance committee is Abe Mudgett and Breezy\nBenson.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for you, Henry,\u201d states the widder, sort of\nbelligerent-like, and the chorus sings the last four words.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a little explanation from you,\u201d states Breezy\nBenson, and Abe nods\u2014\n\n\u201cWe desires the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d says I. \u201cIn the course of human e-vents\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGrab that dynamiter!\u201d yells McFee, from the front door, and Breezy\ntried to foller instructions. Anybody that reaches out to grasp old\nman Peck\u2019s loving son Henry, in times of stress, is in continuous\ndanger. Breezy got it on the jaw, and yours truly went away from there\nwith the enraged citizens on the trail.\n\nNever again do I sic a pack of hounds after a coyote. What few broncs\nare in town are immediate and soon rode after me, and I sure have a\nplenty to attend to. I got a good start, but I know I can\u2019t keep it\nforever. I\u2019m hopping off down a washout, when I happens to see McFee\u2019s\ncorral. I gets an idea right there.\n\nThe gang is quite a ways behind me, trying to make me come out of a\nold shack, so I takes a chance and races for that corral. The\nautymobile is pointed the wrong way, and I ain\u2019t got no time to turn\nit around. I yanks the front wheels around, sets the brake, grabs the\ncrank and prays. Bingo! She took it the first turn. I yanks off the\nbrake, and away I goes, straight for the posse.\n\nI yanks the little jigger down and we sure hits for Paradise in a\nhurry. They scatters at my approach, swings in behind me, and up the\nmain street of Paradise we goes, strung out for a quarter of a mile\nand stretching all the time.\n\nThat machine was a humdinger as long as I\u2019m in danger, but when I\nleaves \u2019em far behind she lays down and quits like a yal-ler pup. I\nsets there and looks around, and out into the road wanders three\nsaddled broncs. I ducks, thinking they\u2019re some of the posse, but a\nsecond look tells me that they\u2019re some of the broncs what left\nParadise yesterday, when the autymobile first came in.\n\nOne Cross J bronc has a long rope dragging, so I catches him and then\nropes the other two. I strings out across the hills toward home, puts\n\u2019em in the home corral, and goes to bed. I reckon it\u2019s almost morning\nwhen the Cross J bunch gets home. Muley, Telescope, Chuck and the old\nman all comes into the bunk-house, but they don\u2019t see me.\n\n\u201cHo, hum-m-m-m!\u201d yawns the old man. \u201cI\u2019m glad to be home. This has\nbeen one strenuous holiday, fellers.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe sure has,\u201d agrees Telescope. \u201cThat pe-rade was a humdinger.\u201d\n\nI sets up in bed and looks \u2019em over.\n\n\u201cPe-rade?\u201d I asks. \u201cDid they have a pe-rade?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, little one,\u201d replied Muley. \u201cWe had a pe-rade that we\u2019ll date\ntime from. We had eight Miss Columbuses and\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2014who led it?\u201d I asks.\n\n\u201cYou did, you danged fool!\u201d whooped Telescope.\n\n                              THE END",
