    "body": "\n[Sidenote: Joey knew the old man had somehow faked his pictures; after\nall, nobody could photograph the future. But then the future began to\nhappen!]\n\nJoey Barrett set his camera carefully to one side and swung onto the\nedge of the desk. He knew this annoyed Nugent, and, at the moment,\nnothing gave him greater satisfaction than his ability to irritate the\neditor.\n\nHis heels thunked against the highly polished sides of the desk, and he\nshook his head very deliberately, in rhythm with the heel-hammering.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"I don't think so, Nugent.\" He decided the drumming had\nlost its impact, so, he crossed his legs and turned to face the balding\nman behind the desk. \"Why should I? This assignment's out of my line and\nyou know it.\"\n\nNugent nodded. \"I know. But this is an unusual story, Joey, and I'd like\nto get a photographer's slant on it.\"\n\n\"Want to find out how the other half thinks, huh?\"\n\nNugent referred to a memo. \"This is the address.\" He pushed the slip of\npaper toward Joey. \"I think you'll find this Jason Ewing most\ncooperative.\"\n\n\"He's a crackpot.\" Joey shied away from the memo and slid off the desk.\n\"That's why none of your brainy reporters will touch the assignment.\"\n\n\"He's eccentric.\" Nugent didn't bother to hide his impatience. \"What\ninventor isn't?\"\n\n\"He's an inventor?\"\n\n\"New kind of camera. That's where you come in, Joey.\" Nugent leaned back\nin his swivel chair. \"I want a photographer's reactions to it.\"\n\n\"What's so special about his camera?\"\n\nNugent didn't look at Joey. \"It photographs another dimension.\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence. Nugent was abruptly preoccupied with his\nhands. Joey moved slowly toward the desk.\n\n\"Another dimension! You mean stereoptican stuff? With depth?\"\n\nNugent stood. \"No. I don't think that's what Ewing means.\" He moved from\nhis desk to the window. \"I want you to find out what it is. Get all the\ninformation you can.\"\n\n\"Are you sure this doesn't belong on the comic page, Nugent?\"\n\nDusk was settling over the city. Nugent stared out at the darkening\nskyline. \"I admit it sounds crazy. But, it'll make a good human interest\nyarn.\" He turned back to Joey. \"Just bring in the facts and one of the\nre-write boys will put them in shape.\"\n\nJoey Barrett's chin set doggedly. \"You've got no right to ask me to....\"\n\nBut he didn't finish. His editor had abruptly moved in very close.\n\"You're in no position to quibble, Joey.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\nNugent's thin lips were tightly compressed. \"The management's not happy\nwith you.\" Joey's laugh was brittle. Nugent walked slowly back to his\ndesk. \"I've had more and more complaints about your work.\"\n\nJoey was close behind him. \"I take the assignments you hand me. And\nthere's no one on the staff gets a sharper shot.\"\n\nNugent waved this aside. \"It's your manner.\" He pushed a glossy eight by\nten print toward the photographer. \"You play up the grisly, the\nmacabre.\"\n\nJoey stared down at the picture. A slow smile narrowed his eyes. \"I\nphotograph what I see. I figure it's what your readers want to see,\ntoo.\"\n\nNugent sat heavily. \"We had a hundred phone calls about that picture.\nBrutal ... sadistic ... morbid.\"\n\nThe print fell face up before Nugent. He turned it over. Joey laughed.\n\"Sure. It's all those things. And they loved it.\" He leaned very close\nto Nugent. \"You didn't have to print it.\"\n\n\"It was the only shot I had. It was print it or be scooped on one of the\nbig stories of the year.\"\n\nJoey's outward nonchalance failed to mask entirely his inner tension.\n\"When I take a picture, they remember it.\"\n\n\"There's a difference between memorable photography and cheap\nsensationalism.\" The editor picked up the memo with Ewing's address.\n\"All things considered,\" he said, \"I think you'd better get this\ninterview for me.\"\n\nJoey stared at Nugent for an insolent second. Then, he took the memo. He\nchecked the address, jammed the paper into his pocket, and moved quickly\nto the door. Hand on the knob, he paused.\n\n\"Oh, Nugent,\" he called, \"if you can't see the story I bring back, just\nremember: it's in another dimension.\"\n\nHe slammed the door on Nugent's anger.\n\n\n\nEarly evening traffic was heavy as he pulled into the quiet,\nold-fashioned street where Ewing lived.\n\nSober brownstone houses, their front steps rising steeply to stain-glass\npaneled doors; heavily curtained bay windows; weather-stained and\nrotting gingerbread; an atmosphere of reluctant decay and genteel\nsenescence. Ewing's house was like a dozen others in the same block.\n\nJoey was not a man given to hunches, and yet, as he climbed out of his\ncar and stood staring up at the silent house, he could not repress a\nshiver of apprehension.\n\nHe looked up the street. Nothing marred the quiet. A middle-aged woman\nhurried home with her armload of groceries. A man paraded an ancient dog\non a leash.\n\nSlowly, Joey climbed the steps. His apprehension was no more than the\nresentment he felt for the assignment. He yanked the old-fashioned bell\nand listened for its echoes dying deep in the house.\n\nHe fidgeted impatiently. Perhaps old Ewing wasn't at home. Or, maybe he\nwas so eccentric he no longer answered the bell. Joey jerked it again.\n\nOn the traffic-noisy boulevard a block away, he heard a raw squealing of\nbrakes.\n\nJoey sighed and turned away. He'd wasted an hour. He started down the\nsteps. And the door opened.\n\nJason Ewing was very old. His incredibly blue eyes seemed alien in the\nyellow parchment face. His clothing, his manner, even his speech were\narchaic.\n\nAs Joey shook the bony hand, Ewing was apologizing for the delay.\n\n\"I was in my dark-room,\" he said--the voice strangely resonant to come\nfrom so frail a chest--\"and I had to get the developer off my hands.\"\n\nJoey nodded and stepped inside. The atmosphere of the house was a\ncurious mixture of chemical and decay. There was a layer of dust on the\nbric-a-brac, and as Joey followed the stooped figure from the entry-hall\ninto the living-room, he saw Ewing as a kind of insubstantial ghost,\nmoving through the deserted rooms so carefully that the dust was not\ndisturbed.\n\nEwing gestured to a chair which looked prim and uncomfortable in its\nyellowed antimacassars. \"Sit down, please, Mr. Barrett.\" He switched on\nan ornate table lamp. \"It's most kind of you to be interested in my\nwork.\"\n\nJoey gave him the automatic smile. The room was a combination studio and\nparlor. A bulky, antique camera lorded it over the conventional\nfurnishings. Its unblinking eye regarded Joey coldly.\n\nThere was a fireplace, with massive brass andirons cast to resemble\ngriffon-heads; purple draperies at the window were faded by sun and\ntime; the heavy furniture was defiantly shabby; even the antique\nphotograph album with its plush cover and gold-plated clasp and lock was\nright for the room. This was Jason Ewing's world and Joey felt himself\nto be an alien.\n\n\n\nEwing hovered nervously, white fingers clenching and unclenching,\nreaching out, now and then, to touch the album on the dusty table-top.\n\"I know you are a busy man, Mr. Barrett,\" he said, \"so I'll come at once\nto the point.\"\n\nJoey relaxed as much as he could in the old chair. \"I should tell you\nfirst, Mr. Ewing, that I'm not a writer. I'm a photographer. My editor\nthought maybe you and me would talk the same language.\"\n\nEwing bobbed his head up and down. \"Excellent. Excellent.\" He pulled up\na small chair. \"Believe me, Mr. Barrett, I hesitated a very long while\nbefore I decided to make my discovery public.\"\n\nJoey disguised a grin. \"What finally decided you?\"\n\nEwing closed his eyes. \"I'm not well. Heart. Most unreliable. Doctor\ntells me I may ... may die ... at any time.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\n\"But, before I die,\" the old man said, leaning forward again, \"I must\nshare my secret.\" He seemed to have difficulty in finding the words he\nsought. \"It's ... it's so extraordinary, Mr. Barrett, that I've been\nafraid to divulge it.\" He gave a sad shake of his head. \"People today\nare so unwilling to accept the unusual.\"\n\nJoey writhed inwardly. This was worse than he had thought. He would make\nNugent pay. \"Mr. Nugent said something about your photographing another\ndimension,\" he prompted.\n\nThe old man pushed himself to his feet. \"It was accidental. I've dabbled\nin amateur photography for years.\" He limped over to his camera. \"Not\nonly took pictures--developed my own.\" He paused and looked very\ndirectly at Joey. \"About six years ago, I began experimenting with a new\ndeveloper.\"\n\nEwing's eyes were disturbing. Joey looked away. \"You had used commercial\ndevelopers before?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Ewing gripped the camera. \"I wanted a developer that would give a\nmore sharply defined image. I tried fifty different formulae--never\nquite achieving what I had in mind.\"\n\nJoey lit a cigarette. \"You must have spent a lot of time on it.\"\n\n\"I had retired. I live alone here. No other interests.\" The phrases came\nin little gasps, as if Ewing had to force the words between his lips.\n\"Made no progress. And then, I tried Formula #53.\"\n\nThe pause indicated Joey was expected to react. \"Formula #53?\"\n\nEwing moved back to the light. \"My fifty-third experiment. Radical\ndeparture from commercial developers.\"\n\n\"It succeeded?\"\n\n\"It succeeded, Mr. Barrett, but not in the way I had imagined.\" The\nfish-white hands rested on the photo album. \"I developed some film in\nFormula #53 and received the shock of my life.\" His voice was a whisper.\n\"The pictures on the negative were NOT the pictures I had taken.\"\n\nHe paused to watch the effect on Barrett. Joey scratched his ear. \"You\ntook one set of pictures and the negatives you got were of another set?\"\n\n\"I know what you're thinking,\" Ewing said. \"What I thought at first:\nthat I'd gotten hold of the wrong film. But that wasn't the answer. The\nsame thing happened again and again. Whenever I used Formula #53 as my\ndeveloper, I produced a strange set of pictures.\"\n\nJoey stood up nervously. The old boy was crazier than he had first\nguessed. Humoring him seemed the only answer. \"That's incredible.\"\n\nEwing nodded excitedly. \"I thought I was losing my mind. But, slowly, I\nbegan to realize what had happened.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nThe old man sank into the chair by the table. \"School of modern\nphilosophers ... teaches all time is co-existent.\"\n\nJoey felt almost sorry for the old boy. He was so much in earnest about\nhis crack-brained discovery. \"Time ... co-existent?\"\n\n\"Past, present, future--all simultaneous. Running along in parallel\ndimensions.\"\n\n\n\nJoey tried a laugh. \"Little rough for me, Mr. Ewing,\" he apologized.\n\"Look,\" he went on quickly, \"I've been thinking....\"\n\nBut Ewing wasn't listening. \"Simplify it. At this moment, Caesar\ncrossing the Rubicon; Columbus is discovering America; you and I are\ntalking; a man in the twenty-fifth century is rocketing toward Mars.\"\n\n\"I see what you mean.\"\n\nEwing was holding the old fashioned photo album in his lap. \"Well, I\nknow now that what I've stumbled into with Formula #53 is another\ndimension in time.\"\n\n\"You mean that ... that you can take a picture of what's happening in\nanother time?\"\n\nEwing nodded. \"I know it's difficult to grasp, Mr. Barrett.\" He held out\nthe plush-covered album. \"But I have proof.\"\n\nJoey stepped toward the old man. \"You've got pictures in there--pictures\nof this other dimension?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" He fumbled in his vest pocket, found a small key, and with\ntrembling hand inserted it in the album lock. \"I've never shown anyone\nthese pictures before,\" he said.\n\nDespite himself, Joey felt excited. Even as he dismissed Ewing as a\nhopeless crackpot, he was disturbingly eager to see the pictures in the\nold album.\n\nEwing gestured for him to be seated. Joey sat in the chair near the\ntable and the old man handed him the open album.\n\n\"So far,\" Ewing said, \"I haven't been able to control the process. I\nphotograph a subject and the picture may be projected ten years into the\nfuture or a hundred years into the past. There must be an infinite\nnumber of dimensions registered on the film, but my developer varies.\"\n\nJoey's initial eagerness was quickly dissipated. The photographs in the\nalbum were disappointingly ordinary. True, there were some that seemed\nto be trick-shots and a few in which the costuming was unfamiliar, but\ncertainly nothing to document the old boy's claim. Aside from a few\nshots that were interesting because of their violence, there was nothing\nin the album.\n\nEwing waited for Joey's reaction--the parchment face even more deeply\nwrinkled by excitement--the blue eyes blazing.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Barrett?\"\n\nJoey left the album open at the picture of a gruesome accident.\nApparently, two cars had met head-on. The one had been a sleek\nconvertible. The other was an old sedan. Both were terribly crumpled.\nGlass littered the street. Steam spewed from the twisted radiator of the\nold wreck.\n\nA man sprawled from the front seat of the sedan--an elderly man, with a\nwhite beard--a beard spattered with blood. His sightless eyes stared\naccusingly at the small cluster of onlookers who surrounded the wreck.\nNearby, thrown from the crushed convertible by the impact, lay a woman.\nShe wore an extreme evening dress, and a fur cape had fallen not far\nfrom her body. All around her were pearls ... spilled from the broken\nstrand at her throat.\n\nJoey looked up at Ewing. He shook his head. \"You've got some interesting\npictures, but I can't see that they prove your theory. They could have\nbeen taken any time.\" He pointed to the photo of the wreck. \"This one,\nfor instance.\" He smiled up at the old man. \"That looks like a shot I\nmight have made.\"\n\nEwing's entire body seemed shaken by his eagerness to prove his point.\n\"Mr. Barrett ... that picture is of an accident that hasn't occurred.\nOne evening, I took a picture of the street out there ... at the corner\n... where our street joins the Boulevard.\" His voice was low, urgent.\n\"When I snapped that photo, the street was deserted. There were no\ncars--no people.\"\n\n\n\nJoey took another look at the wreck. He closed the album with finality.\n\"Mr. Ewing,\" he said, \"I'm not questioning your sincerity. I can see\nthat you're convinced your developer has extraordinary powers.\"\n\n\"But you don't believe me.\" There was despair in the old man's voice.\n\"What can I say to make you believe that you've just looked at the\npicture of an accident that's yet to happen.\"\n\nJoey laid the album on the table. \"It's an interesting theory.\"\n\nEwing moved to his camera. \"It's more than a theory. I can prove it.\" He\nducked behind the camera. \"Let me take your picture, Mr. Barrett, and\nI'll prove it.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute!\" Joey half rose from the chair in protest, and then,\nwith a shrug subsided. \"Sure,\" he said. \"Why not?\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Ewing answered. He focused the camera, cut on extra lights,\nposed Joey, took his picture.\n\nThe ordeal over, Joey moved toward the door.\n\n\"You'll see, Mr. Barrett. This picture will convince you.\"\n\nJoey nodded. \"Sure, sure. You give me a call.\"\n\nThey were in the entry-hall. \"As I said,\" Ewing continued, \"I haven't\nmuch time. That's why I'm very anxious to pass on my discovery. It could\ndo great good--in the right hands.\"\n\nJoey opened the door. \"I understand,\" he said. \"You give me a call.\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\nJoey was outside--the door between him and Ewing's pathetic eagerness.\nAs he bounded down the steps, he was devising a revenge extreme enough\nfor Nugent.\n\nHe slipped in behind the wheel. It was surprising that anyone as near\npsycho as Ewing should be loose. The old boy had lived too long alone in\nthe empty house.\n\nJust as he drew away from the curb, Joey heard the crash. Squealing\nrubber, splintering glass, rending metal, perhaps a human scream ...\ncompounded into an awful discord that ricocheted against the quiet\nbrownstone fronts, building to a crescendo of metallic anguish.\n\nAfter the first moment of surprise, Joey experienced the curious\nexaltation he always felt at a scene of violence. The trip wasn't a\nwaste after all. He'd get a picture, and from the sound of the crash, it\nwould be a good one.\n\nAs he clambered out of his car, camera ready, people were running down\nsteps, cars were swinging off the boulevard--the first cluster of the\ncurious was collecting.\n\nWith professional assurance, Joey brushed people aside and moved in. One\ncar had been stopped at the intersection and the other had careened off\nthe boulevard and smashed head-on into it.\n\nJoey stopped on the crowd's inner edge and stared.\n\nIt was impossible. One car was an old sedan. The other, a sleek\nconvertible. An old man with blood-spattered white beard half-spilled\nfrom the sedan and on the glistening pavement lay a woman in evening\ndress, surrounded by dozens of pearls.\n\n\n\nFrom habit, Joey took the picture of the accident and delivered it to\nNugent. By the time he had developed his picture, he was beginning to\nenjoy the knowledge that it was an exact duplicate of the photograph in\nEwing's album.\n\nOnly he and Ewing realized the power of Formula #53. It couldn't be\ncoincidence. The details were too exact. Ewing's explanation was the\nonly one possible. And that meant the old boy wasn't crazy. The formula\nwas all he insisted.\n\nSuch a formula could be a great force for good, the old man had said. In\nthe right hands. In the hands of Joey Barrett.\n\nJoey decided to keep his secret. This was not a power to be shared with\nLeslie Nugent or anyone else. So, when he faced his editor again, he was\ncareful to dismiss the Ewing interview with just the proper degree of\ncasualness.\n\n\"There's no doubt about it,\" he said. \"Ewing's a crackpot.\"\n\nNugent scowled impatiently. \"Even so....\"\n\n\"I tell you, if we run the story he gave me, we'll be laughed out of\nbusiness.\" Joey watched Nugent closely.\n\n\"But surely as a human interest yarn,\" the editor protested, \"we'd be\njustified.\"\n\nJoey shook his head. \"He's an old crank, trying to build up his ego with\nthese phony claims.\"\n\nNugent leaned back. \"There was absolutely no basis for his theory?\"\n\n\"None.\" Joey laughed easily. \"You should have seen the obvious trick\nphotos he tried to pass off as evidence. My advice is: forget Jason\nEwing.\"\n\nThere was a long pause. Then, Nugent nodded. \"All right. Thanks, Joey.\"\nHe picked up a glossy of the accident. \"You outdid yourself on this\none.\"\n\nJoey sauntered to the door. \"The master's touch,\" he called. \"I'll hit\nyou for a raise later.\"\n\nSatisfied that Nugent considered the Ewing story dead, Joey left the\npaper and hurried to a pay-phone.\n\nWhen Jason Ewing answered, there was a note of near-hysteria in his\nvoice. He seemed frightened by Joey's interest and was extremely\nreluctant to give him another interview.\n\n\"I don't blame you for being irritated,\" Joey said. \"I was very rude.\nBut look, Mr. Ewing, now I see I was wrong. We can't talk about it on\nthe phone. All I want is a chance to see you again. Maybe tomorrow?\"\n\nThere was such a long pause that Joey thought Ewing had broken the\nconnection. Then, he heard the old man sigh.\n\n\"I ... I don't know what to say,\" Ewing faltered. \"In the light of ...\nof recent developments, I think it would be unwise to involve you, Mr.\nBarrett.\"\n\nJoey laughed. \"Listen, this is the break of a lifetime for me. How about\ntomorrow morning at nine?\"\n\n\"Tomorrow.\" The one word was neither affirmation nor question.\n\nBut Joey chose to interpret it as agreement. \"See you in the morning at\nnine, Mr. Ewing,\" he said, and hung up quickly.\n\n\n\nJoey slept little that night. He was up early, gulped a hasty breakfast,\nand stood on the steps at Ewing's house at five minutes to nine.\n\nAgain, as on the day before, he had to ring the bell twice before the\ndoor opened and the wrinkled face showed itself. He was shocked by the\nchange in Ewing. The man seemed much older and there was a haunting fear\nin the blue eyes.\n\n\"It would have been wiser,\" the old man whispered, \"if you had not come\nhere again--for us not to have met.\"\n\nJoey was determined to be charming. He put his hand on the thin old arm\nand gently pushed Ewing into the entry hall. \"I don't blame you for\nbeing bitter,\" he said, closing the door. \"I was a fool yesterday.\"\n\nEwing pulled free and moved agitatedly into the living-room. Even the\nmorning sun made no impression on the shadows there.\n\nThe old man didn't look at Joey. \"You were right,\" he said. \"It would be\nbetter to forget the formula.\"\n\nJoey fought down his impatience. He tried to move smoothly, keep his\nvoice calm. \"No. You mustn't think that. You can't be selfish. You said\nyourself, Mr. Ewing, that this knowledge could do great good.\"\n\nThe quiet persuasiveness of Joey's approach seemed cause for further\nalarm. \"I said that, but since then ... I ... I see that it might also\ndo great harm.\"\n\nHe tottered away from Joey and slumped tiredly into the chair by the\ntable.\n\n\"Mr. Ewing,\" Joey said, following him, \"yesterday I saw one of your\npictures come to life.\"\n\nEwing did not look up. \"I know. The accident at the corner. I was afraid\nyou had seen it.\"\n\n\"Afraid!\" Joey laughed. \"That was the clincher.\" He leaned over the old\nman. \"Listen, Mr. Ewing, the second I saw that wreck, I realized what we\nhave in Formula #53. I want to help you make use of it--the proper use.\"\n\nThe old man shook his head. \"I'm afraid,\" he whimpered.\n\nJoey ignored the interruption. \"We'll work this together. If we play it\nsmart, the sky's the limit. We can be millionaires. Name our own\nprices.\" He laughed in his excitement. \"They'll meet our demands when\nthey see what we've got to offer.\"\n\nEwing had slowly pushed himself to his feet. He regarded Joey with mixed\napprehension and disgust. \"You ... you can't commercialize my\ndiscovery,\" he protested. \"I wouldn't permit the formula to be used for\npersonal gain.\"\n\n\"Not just MY gain. You and me together.\" Joey looked at the red-plush\nphoto album and rubbed his hands. \"I'll bet we got pictures in that\nalbum worth a hundred grand.\"\n\nAbruptly, Ewing stepped past Joey and seized the album. He cradled it in\nhis arms. \"That's out of the question.\" He tottered toward the\nfireplace. \"Mr. Barrett,\" he pleaded, \"I beg you to go now.\"\n\nAnger simmered in Joey--anger and frustration. \"All right,\" he said,\nforcing himself to be reasonable. \"Those are your pictures.\" He faced\nEwing at the fireplace. \"But if I take some, will you give me the\nformula so I can develop them?\"\n\nStubbornly, the old man shook his head.\n\n\"What IS the formula?\" Joey demanded.\n\n\"I've never written it down.\" Ewing clutched the red-plush photo album\nwith one hand and gestured imploringly with the other. \"Mr. Barrett,\nevery moment you stay here, you jeopardize us both. Leave now. Please.\nForget we ever met ... that you ever heard of Formula #53.\"\n\n\"Forget!\" Joey's hands clenched and unclenched in mounting desperation.\n\"You can't start a guy on a thing like this, Ewing, and then tell him to\nforget it!\" For a long second, they stared at each other. Ewing was\nbreathing heavily and perspiration beaded the parchment face.\n\n\n\nJoey tried another tactic: \"Look ... if you don't want to give me the\nformula, at least let me have a few of the pictures in that album.\nWhatever I get out of them, I'll split with you.\" He reached out\ntentatively.\n\nEwing shrank back. \"Go away. Let me alone. There's nothing in the album.\nI burned the pictures.\"\n\n\"You're lying!\" The thought of the money the old fool had thrown away\ncut into Joey like a knife. \"You wouldn't do a crazy thing like that.\"\n\n\"Only two left. Should have burned them.\"\n\nPanic seized Joey. He grabbed at the red-plush album. \"I don't believe\nyou. Let me see.\"\n\nEwing held onto the book with the tenacity of an aged crab. \"You\nmustn't,\" he croaked. \"You're destroying yourself. Don't.\"\n\nBut the old man's stubborn and futile resistance stoked the smouldering\nfires of Joey's anger. He gripped one corner of the coveted trophy with\nhis left hand, and with his right, gave Ewing a vicious shove.\n\nWith a rattling cry, the old man staggered back and fell with a clatter\ninto the fireplace.\n\nThe book was in Joey's hand. He didn't look at Ewing. The clasp was not\nlocked. Feverishly, he opened the heavy cover. The truth took his breath\naway. Ewing hadn't lied. The pages were empty. He had burned the\npictures. The crazy old fool!\n\nBut he had said there were two pictures left. Joey thumbed hastily\nthrough the empty album till he reached the first of the remaining\npictures.\n\nHe cried out.\n\nIt was a self-portrait of Ewing. He lay sprawled on the floor before the\nfireplace, blue eyes staring up at the ceiling, blood smearing his\ntemple and one of the massive brass andirons.\n\nJoey dropped the album on the table and slowly turned. He closed his\neyes. \"Oh, God!\" he whispered. \"No! No!\"\n\nLike a sleep-walker, he moved to the silent figure, knelt, searched in\nvain for pulse or heart-beat. There was none. Jason Ewing was dead.\n\nJoey stared at the andiron with its tell-tale stain. He pulled himself\nup to a half-crouch and looked wildly around the dark living-room. The\ncamera was an accusing eye. \"It was an accident,\" he murmured. \"His\nheart. He was an old man.\"\n\nThe photo album still lay open on the table.\n\nEwing had saved two pictures. One of himself. The other....\n\nThere was a heavy knocking at the front door.\n\nJoey went shakily to the album. Gripping the table's edge, he turned to\nthe second picture:\n\nJoey Barrett sat in a chair. His trousers were slit. His head was shaved\nand there were straps and electrodes.\n\nIt was the kind of picture that would sell a thousand extra copies.\n\n\n\n\n",
