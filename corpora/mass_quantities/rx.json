    "body": "                _The tenth son of a tenth son was very\n                sick, but it was written that he would\n                never die. Of course, it was up to the\n                 Earth doctor to see that he didn't!_\n\n\nThey didn't realize they were in trouble until it was too late to stop\nit. The call from Morua II came in quite innocently, relayed to the\nship from HQ in Standard GPP Contract code for crash priority, which\nmeant Top Grade Planetary Emergency, and don't argue about it, fellows,\njust get there, fast. Red Doctor Sam Jenkins took one look at the\nflashing blinker and slammed the controls into automatic; gyros hummed,\nbearings were computed and checked, and the General Practice Patrol\nship _Lancet_ spun in its tracks, so to speak, and began homing on the\ncall-source like a hound on a fox. The fact that Morua II was a Class\nVI planet didn't quite register with anybody, just then.\n\nTen minutes later the Red Doctor reached for the results of the Initial\nInformation Survey on Morua II, and let out a howl of alarm. A single\ncard sat in the slot with a wide black stripe across it.\n\nJenkins snapped on the intercom. \"Wally,\" he yelped. \"Better get up\nhere fast.\"\n\n\"Trouble?\" said the squawk-box, sleepily.\n\n\"Oh, brother,\" said Jenkins. \"Somebody's cracked the Contract Code or\nsomething.\"\n\nA moment later a tall sleepy man in green undershorts appeared at\nthe control room, rubbing his eyes. \"What happened?\" he said. \"We've\nchanged course.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Ever hear of Morua II?\"\n\nGreen Doctor Wally Stone frowned and scratched his whiskered chin.\n\"Sounds familiar, but I can't quite tune in. Crash call?\" His eye\ncaught the black-striped card. \"Class VI planet ... a plague spot! How\ncan we get a crash-call from _this_?\"\n\n\"You tell me,\" said Jenkins.\n\n\"Wait a minute. Seems to me there was some sort of nasty business--\"\n\nJenkins nodded heavily. \"There sure was. Five successive attempts\nto establish a Contract with them, and five times we got thrown out\nbodily. The last time an Earth ship landed there half the crew was\nsummarily shot and the others came home with their ears cut off. Seems\nthe folks on Morua II didn't want a Contract with Hospital Earth. And\nthey're still in the jungle, as far as their medicine goes. Witch\ndoctors and spells.\" He tossed the Info-card down the chute with a\ngrowl. \"So now we have an emergency call from them in a Contract code\nthey couldn't possibly know.\"\n\nThe surgeon in the green undershorts chewed his lip. \"Looks like\nsomebody in that last crew spilled the beans before they shot him.\"\n\n\"Obviously.\"\n\n\"Well, what are we doing on automatics? We're not _going_ there, are\nwe?\"\n\n\"What else? You know the law. Instantaneous response to any\ncrash-priority call, regardless of circumstances--\"\n\n\"Law be damned,\" Stone cried. \"File a protest with HQ. Cancel the\ncourse bearings and thumb our noses at them!\"\n\n\"And spend the next twenty years scrubbing test tubes.\" Jenkins shook\nhis head. \"Sorry, it took me too long to get aboard one of these tubs.\nWe don't do that in the General Practice Patrol, remember? I don't know\nhow Morua II got the code, but they got it, and that's all the farther\nwe're supposed to think. We answer the call, and beef about it later.\nIf we still happen to be around later, that is.\"\n\n\n\nIt had always been that way. Since the first formal Medical Service\nContract had been signed with Deneb III centuries before, Hospital\nEarth had laboriously built its reputation on that single foundation\nstone: immediate medical assistance, without question or hesitation,\nwhenever and wherever it was required, on any planet bound by Contract.\nThat was the law, for Hospital Earth could not afford to jeopardize a\nContract.\n\nIn the early days of galactic exploration, of course, Medical Services\nwas only a minor factor in an expanding commercial network that drew\nmultitudes of planets into social and economic interdependence; but\nin any growing civilization division of labor inevitably occurs.\nOther planets outstripped Earth in technology, in communications, in\ntransport, and in production techniques--but Earth stood unrivaled in\nits development of the biological sciences. Wherever an Earth ship\nlanded, the crew was soon rendering Medical Services of one sort or\nanother, whether they had planned it that way or not. On Deneb III\nthe Medical Service Contract was formalized, and Hospital Earth came\ninto being. Into all known corners of the galaxy ships of the General\nPractice Patrol were dispatched--\"Galactic Pill Peddlers\" forging a\nchain of Contracts from Aldebaran to Zarn, accepting calls, diagnosing\nills, arranging for proper disposition of whatever medical problems\nthey came across. Serious problems were shuttled back to Hospital Earth\nwithout delay; more frequently the GPP crews--doctors of the Red and\nGreen services, representing the ancient Earthly arts of medicine and\nsurgery--were able to handle the problems on the spot and by themselves.\n\nIt was a rugged service for a single planet to provide, and it was\ncostly. Many planets studied the terms of Contract and declined,\npleasantly but firmly--and were assured nevertheless that GPP ships\nwould answer an emergency call if one was received. There would be a\nfee, of course, but the call would be answered. And then there were\nother planets--places such as Morua II....\n\nThe _Lancet_ homed on the dismal grey planet with an escort of eight\nugly fighter ships which had swarmed up like hornets to greet her. They\ntriangled her in, grappled her, and dropped her with a bone-jarring\ncrash into a landing slot on the edge of the city. As Sam Jenkins and\nWally Stone picked themselves off the bulkheads, trying to rearrange\nthe scarlet and green uniforms of their respective services, the main\nentrance lock burst open with a squeal of tortured metal. At least a\ndozen Moruans poured into the control room--huge bearlike creatures\nwith heavy grey fur ruffing out around their faces like thick hairy\ndog collars. The one in command strode forward arrogantly, one huge\npaw leveling a placer-gun with a distinct air of business about it.\n\"Well, you took long enough!\" he roared, baring a set of yellow fangs\nthat sent shivers up Jenkins' spine. \"Fourteen hours! Do you call that\nspeed?\"\n\nJenkins twisted down the volume on his Translator with a grimace.\n\"You're lucky we came at all,\" he said peevishly. \"Where's your\nContract? Where did you get the Code?\"\n\n\"Bother the Contract,\" the Moruan snarled. \"You're supposed to be\nphysicians, eh?\" He eyed them up and down as though he disapproved of\neverything that he saw. \"You make sick people well?\"\n\n\"That's the general idea.\"\n\n\"All right.\" He poked a hairy finger at a shuttle car perched outside.\n\"In there.\"\n\nThey were herded into the car with three guards in front and three\nbehind. A tunnel gulped them into darkness as the car careened madly\ninto the city. For an endless period they pitched and churned through\nblackness--then suddenly emerged into a high, gilded hall with pale\nsunlight filtering down. From the number of decorated guards, and\nthe scraping and groveling that went on as they were hurried through\nembattled corridors, it seemed likely they were nearing the seat of\ngovernment. Finally a pair of steel doors opened to admit them to\na long, arched hallway. Their leader, who was called Aguar by his\nflunkies, halted them with a snarl and walked across to the tall figure\nguarding the far door. The guard did not seem pleased; he wore a long\npurple cap with a gold ball on the end which twitched wildly as their\nwhispered conference devolved into growling and snarling. Finally\nAguar motioned them to follow, and they entered the far chamber, with\nPurple-Hat glaring at them malignantly as they passed.\n\nAguar halted them at the door-way. \"His Eminence will see you,\" he\ngrowled.\n\n\"Who is His Eminence?\" Jenkins asked.\n\n\"The Lord High Emperor of All Morua and Creator of the Galaxies,\" Aguar\nrumbled. \"He is the Tenth Son of a Tenth Son, and it is written that he\ncan never die. When you enter, bow,\" he added.\n\nThe Tenth Son of a Tenth Son couldn't have cared less whether they\nbowed or not. The room was dark and rank with the smell of sickness. On\na pallet in the center lay a huge Moruan, panting and groaning. He was\nwrapped like a mummy in bedclothes of scarlet interwoven with gold; on\neither side of the bed braziers flickered with sickly greenish light.\n\nHis Eminence looked up at them from bloodshot eyes and greeted them\nwith a groan of anguish that seemed to roll up from the soles of his\nfeet. \"Go away,\" he moaned, closing his eyes again and rolling over\nwith his back toward them.\n\nThe Red Doctor blinked at his companion, then turned to Aguar. \"What\nillness is this?\" he whispered.\n\n\"He is afflicted with a Pox, as any fool can see. All others it\nkills--but His Eminence is the Tenth Son of a Tenth Son, and it is\nwritten--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I know. He can never die.\" Sam gave Wally a sour look. \"What\nhappens, though, if he just up and does?\"\n\nAguar's paw came down with a clatter on the hilt of his sword. \"_He\ndoes not die._ We have you here now. You are doctors, you say. Cure\nhim.\"\n\nThey walked to the bedside and lifted back the covers. Jenkins took a\nlimp paw in his hand. He finally found a palpable pulse just below the\nsecond elbow joint. It was fast and thready. The creature's skin bagged\nloosely from his arm.\n\n\"Looks like His Eminence can't read,\" Wally muttered. \"He's going fast,\nDoc.\"\n\nJenkins nodded grimly. \"What does it look like to you?\"\n\n\"How should I know? I've never seen a healthy Moruan before, to say\nnothing of a sick one. It looks like a pox all right.\"\n\n\"Probably a viremia of some sort.\" Jenkins went over the great groaning\nhulk with inquiring fingers.\n\n\"If it's a viremia, we're cooked,\" Stone whispered. \"None of the drugs\ncross over--and we won't have time to culture the stuff and grow any\nnew ones--\"\n\nJenkins turned to Aguar. \"How long has this gone on?\"\n\n\"For days,\" the Moruan growled. \"He can't speak. He grows hot and\ncannot eat. He moans until the Palace trembles.\"\n\n\"What about your own doctors?\"\n\nAguar spat angrily on the floor. \"They are jealous as cats until\ntrouble comes. Then they hide in the caves like chickens. See the\ngreen flames? Death flames. They leave him here to die. But now that\nis all over. We have heard about you wizards from Hospital Earth. You\ncure all, the stories say. You are very wise, they say. You balance\nthe humors and drive forth the spirits of the Pox like devils.\" He\ngave them a terrible grin and tightened his hand on the gold-encrusted\nsword. \"Now we see.\"\n\n\"We can't promise,\" Jenkins began. \"Sometimes we're called too\nlate--but perhaps not in this case,\" he added hastily when he saw the\nMoruan's face. \"Tenth Son and all that. But you'll have to give us\nfreedom to work.\"\n\n\"What kind of freedom?\"\n\n\"We'll need supplies and information from our ship. We'll have to\nconsult your physicians. We'll need healthy Moruans to examine--\"\n\n\"But you will cure him,\" Aguar said.\n\nJenkins took a deep breath and gripped his red tunic around his throat\ntightly. \"Sure, sure,\" he said weakly. \"You just watch us.\"\n\n\n\n\"But what do you think we're going to do?\" the surgeon wailed, back\nin the control room of the _Lancet_. \"Sam, we can't _touch_ him. If\nhe didn't die naturally we'd kill him for sure! We can't go near him\nwithout a Bio-survey--look what happened on Baron when they tried it!\nHalf the planetary population wiped out before they realized that the\nantibiotic was more deadly to the race than the virus was....\"\n\n\"Might not be such a bad idea for Morua,\" the Red Doctor muttered\ngrimly. \"Well, what did you expect me to do--politely refuse? And\nhave our throats slit right on the spot?\" He grabbed a pad and began\nscribbling. \"We've got to do _something_ just to keep alive for a\nwhile.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Wally. \"What, for instance?\"\n\n\"Well, we've got a little to go on just from looking at them. They're\noxygen-breathers, which means they manage internal combustion of\ncarbohydrates, somehow. From the grey skin color I'd guess at a cuprous\nor stannous heme-protein carrying system. They're carnivores, but god\nknows what their protein metabolism is like--Let's get going on some of\nthese specimens Aguar has rounded up for us.\"\n\nThey dug in frantically. Under normal conditions a GPP ship would\nsend in a full crew of technicians to a newly-Contracted planet to\nmake the initial Bio-survey of the indigenous races. Bio-chemists,\nphysiologists, anatomists, microbiologists, radiologists--survey\nworkers from every Service would examine and study the new clients,\ntake them apart cell by cell to see what made them tick.\n\nCertain basic principles were always the same, a fact which accelerated\nthe program considerably. Humanoid or not, all forms of life had basic\nqualities in common. Biochemical reactions were biochemical reactions,\nwhether they happened to occur in a wing-creature of Wolf IV or a\ndoctor from Sol III. Anatomy was a broad determinant: a jelly-blob from\nDeneb I with its fine skein of pulsating nerve fibrils was still just\na jelly-blob, and would never rise above the level of amoeboid yes-no\nresponse because of its utter lack of organization. But a creature\nwith an organized central nervous system and a functional division of\nwork among organ systems could be categorized, tested, studied, and\ncompared, and the information used in combating native disease. Given\nno major setbacks, and full cooperation of the natives, the job only\ntook about six months to do--\n\nFor the crew of the _Lancet_ six hours was seven hours too long. They\nherded cringing Moruan \"volunteers\" into the little ship's lab. Jenkins\nhandled external examinations and blood and tissue chemistries; Stone\nran the X-ray and pan-endoscopic examinations. After four grueling\nhours the Red Doctor groaned and scowled at the growing pile of data.\n\"Okay. It seems that they're vaguely humanoid. And that's about all we\ncan say for sure. I think we're wasting time. What say we tackle the\nWizards for a while?\"\n\nAguar's guards urged the tall Moruan with the purple cap into the\ncontrol room at gunpoint, along with a couple of minor medical\npotentates. Purple-hat's name was Kiz, and it seemed that he wasn't\nhaving any that day.\n\n\"Look,\" said Jenkins intensely. \"You've seen this illness before. We\nhaven't. So you can at least get us started. What kind of course does\nit run?\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"All right then, what causes it? Do you know? Bacteria? Virus?\nDegeneration?\"\n\nSilence.\n\nJenkins' face was pale. \"Look, boys--your Boss out there is going to\ncool before long if something doesn't happen fast--\" His eyes narrowed\non Kiz. \"Of course, that might be right up your alley--how about that?\nHis Eminence bows out, somebody has to bow in, right? Maybe you, huh?\"\n\nKiz began sputtering indignantly; the Red Doctor cut him off. \"It\nadds up,\" he said heatedly. \"You've got the power, you've got your\nmagic and all. Maybe you were the boys that turned thumbs down so\nviolently on the idea of a Hospital Earth Contract, eh? Couldn't risk\nhaving outsiders cutting in on your trade.\" Jenkins rubbed his chin\nthoughtfully. \"But somehow it seems to me you'd have a whale of a lot\nmore power if you learned how to control this Pox.\"\n\nKiz stopped sputtering quite abruptly. He blinked at his confederates\nfor a long moment. Then: \"You're an idiot. It can't be done.\"\n\n\"Suppose it could.\"\n\n\"The Spirit of the Pox is too strong. Our most powerful spells make him\nlaugh. He eats our powders and drinks our potions. Even the Iron Circle\nwon't drive him out.\"\n\n\"Won't it, now! Well, we have iron _needles_ and potions that eat the\nbottoms out of their jars. Suppose _they_ drive him out?\"\n\nThe Moruan was visibly shaken. He held a whispered conference with his\nhenchmen. \"You'll _show_ us these things?\" he asked suspiciously.\n\n\"I'll make a bargain,\" said Jenkins. \"You give us a Contract, we give\nyou the power--fair enough?\"\n\nMore whispers. Wally Stone tugged at Sam's sleeve. \"What do you think\nyou're doing?\" he choked. \"These boys will cut your throat quicker than\nAguar will--\"\n\n\"Maybe not,\" said Sam. \"Look, I've got an idea--risky, but it might\nwork if you'll play along. We can't lose much.\"\n\nThe whispers stopped and Kiz nodded to the Red Doctor. \"All right, we\nbargain,\" he said. \"_After_ you show us.\"\n\n\"Now or never.\" Jenkins threw open the door and nodded to the guards.\n\"I'll be in the sickroom in a very short while. If you're with me, I'll\nsee you there. If not--\" He fingered his throat suggestively.\n\nAs soon as they had gone Jenkins dived into the storeroom and began\nthrowing flasks and bottles into a black bag. Wally Stone watched him\nin bewilderment. \"You're going to kill him,\" he moaned. \"Prayers,\npromises, pills and post-mortems. That's the Medical service for you.\"\n\nSam grinned. \"Maybe you should operate on him. _That_ would open their\neyes all right.\"\n\n\"No thanks, not me. This is a medical case and it's all yours. What do\nyou want me to do?\"\n\n\"Stay here and try your damnedest to get through to HQ,\" said Sam\ngrimly. \"Tell them to send an armada, because we're liable to need one\nin the next few hours--\"\n\n\n\nIf the Tenth Son of a Tenth Son had looked bad before, three hours had\nwitnessed no improvement. The potentate's skin had turned from grey\nto a pasty green as he lay panting on the bed. He seemed to have lost\nstrength enough even to groan, and his eyes were glazed.\n\nOutside the royal chambers Jenkins found a group of green-clad\nmourners, wailing like banshees and tearing out their fur in great grey\nchunks. They stood about a flaming brazier; as Jenkins entered the\nsickroom the wails rose ten decibels and took on a howling-dog quality.\n\nAguar met him at the door. \"He's dying,\" he roared angrily. \"Why don't\nyou do something? Every hour he sinks more rapidly, and all you do is\npoke holes in the healthy ones! And then you send in _this_ bag of\nbones again--\" He glowered at the tall purple-capped figure bending\nover the bed.\n\nJenkins looked sharply at Kiz, and the wizard nodded his head slowly.\n\"Try being quiet for a while,\" Jenkins said to Aguar. \"We're going to\ncure the Boss here.\" Solemnly he slipped off his scarlet tunic and cap\nand laid them on a bench, then set his black bag carefully on the floor\nand threw it open. \"First off, get rid of those things.\" He pointed\nto the braziers at the bedside. \"They're enough to give anybody a\nheadache. And tell those people outside to stop the racket. How can\nthey expect the Spirit of the Pox to come out of His Eminence when\nthey're raising a din like that?\"\n\nAguar's eyes widened for a moment as he hesitated; then he threw open\nthe door and screamed a command. The wailing stopped as though a switch\nhad been thrown. As a couple of cowering guards crept in to remove the\nbraziers, Red Doctor Jenkins drew the wizard aside.\n\n\"Tell me what spells you've already used.\"\n\nHurriedly, Kiz began enumerating, ticking off items on hairy fingers.\nAs he talked Jenkins dug into the black bag and started assembling a\nliter flask, tubing and needles.\n\n\"First we brewed witches' root for seven hours and poured it over his\nbelly. When the Pox appeared in spite of this we lit three red candles\nat the foot of the bed and beat His Eminence steadily for one hour out\nof four, with new rawhide. When His Eminence protested this, we were\ncertain the Spirit had possessed him, so we beat him one hour out of\ntwo--\"\n\nJenkins winced as the accounting of cabalistic clap-trap continued. His\nEminence, he reflected, must have had the constitution of an ox. He\nglanced over at the panting figure on the bed. \"But doesn't _anybody_\never recover from this?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--if the Spirit that afflicts them is very small. Those are\nthe fortunate ones. They grow hot and sick, but they still can eat\nand drink--\" The wizard broke off to stare at the bottle-and-tube\narrangement Jenkins had prepared. \"What's that?\"\n\n\"I told you about the iron needles, didn't I? Hold this a moment.\"\nJenkins handed him the liter flask. \"Hold it high.\" He began searching\nfor a vein on the patient's baggy arm. The Moruan equivalent of blood\nflowed back greenishly in the tube for an instant as he placed the\nneedle; then the flask began to drip slowly.\n\nAguar let out a horrified scream and raced from the room; in a moment\nhe was back with a detachment of guards, all armed to the teeth, and\nthree other Moruan physicians with their retinues of apprentices. Sam\nJenkins held up his hand for silence. He allowed the first intravenous\nflask to pour in rapidly; the second he adjusted to a steady\ndrip-drip-drip.\n\nNext he pulled two large bunsen burners and a gas tank from the bag.\nThese he set up at the foot of the bed, adjusting the blue flames to\nhigh spear-tips. On the bedside table he set up a third with a flask\nabove it; into this he poured some water and a few crystals from a dark\nbottle. In a moment the fluid in the flask was churning and boiling, an\nominous purple color.\n\nKiz watched goggle-eyed.\n\n\"Now!\" said Jenkins, pulling out a long thin rubber tube. \"This should\nannoy the Spirit of the Pox something fierce.\" He popped the tube into\nthe patient's mouth. His Eminence rose up with a gasp, choking and\nfighting, but the tube went down. The Red Doctor ground three white\npills into powder, mixed in some water, and poured it down the tube.\n\nThen he stepped back to view the scene, wiping cold perspiration from\nhis forehead. He motioned to Kiz. \"You see what I'm doing, of course?\"\nhe said loudly enough for Aguar and the guards to hear.\n\n\"Oh, yes--yes! Indeed, indeed,\" said Kiz.\n\n\"Fine. Now this is most important.\" Jenkins searched in the bag until\nhe found a large mortar which he set down on the floor. Squatting\nbehind it, he began tapping it slowly with the pestle, in perfect\nrhythm with the intravenous drip ... and waited.\n\nThe room was deathly still except for a heavy snuffling sound from His\nEminence and the plink-plink of the pestle on the mortar. The flask of\npurple stuff gurgled quietly. An hour passed, and another. Suddenly\nJenkins motioned to Kiz. \"His pulse--quickly!\"\n\nKiz scampered gratefully over to the bedside. \"A hundred and eighty,\"\nhe whispered.\n\nJenkins' face darkened. He peered at the sick man intently. \"It's a\nbad sign,\" he said. \"The Spirit is furious at the intrusion of an\noutsider.\" He motioned toward the mortar. \"Can you do this?\"\n\nWithout breaking the rhythm he transferred the plinking-job to Kiz.\nHe changed the dwindling intravenous bottle. \"Call me when the bottle\nis empty--or if there is any change. Whatever you do, _don't touch\nanything_.\"\n\nWith that he tiptoed from the room. Four murderous-looking guards\ncaught Aguar's eye and followed him out, swords bared. Jenkins sank\ndown on a bench in the hall and fell asleep in an instant.\n\n\n\nThey woke him once, hours later, to change the intravenous solution,\nand he found Kiz still intently pounding on the mortar. Jenkins\nadministered more of the white powder in water down the tube, and went\nback to his bench. He had barely fallen asleep again when they were\nrousing him with frightened voices. \"Quickly!\" Aguar cried. \"There's\nbeen a terrible change!\"\n\nIn the sickroom His Eminence was drenched with sweat, his face\nglistening in the light of the bunsen burners. He rolled from side to\nside, groaning hoarsely. \"_Faster!_\" Jenkins shouted to Kiz at the\nmortar, and began stripping off the sodden bedclothes. \"Blankets,\nnow--plenty of them.\"\n\nThe plink-plink rose to a frantic staccato as Jenkins checked the\npatient's vital signs, wiped more sweat from his furry brow. Quite\nsuddenly His Eminence opened bleary eyes, stared about him, let out a\nmonumental groan and buried his head in the blankets. In two minutes\nhe was snoring softly. His face was cool now, his heart-beat slow and\nregular.\n\nJenkins snatched the mortar from Kiz, and with a wild flourish smashed\nit on the stone floor. Then he grabbed the wizard's paw, raising it\nhigh. \"You've done well!\" he cried to the bewildered physician. \"It's\nover now--the Spirit has departed. His Eminence will recover.\"\n\n\n\nThey escorted him in triumphal procession back to the _Lancet_, where\nWally Stone stared in disbelief as Jenkins and Kiz bowed and hugged\neach other like long-lost brothers at a sad farewell. \"I finally got\nthrough to somebody at HQ,\" he said as the Red Doctor climbed aboard.\n\"It'll take them twenty days at least, to get help, considering that\nMorua is not a Contract planet and we're not supposed to be here in the\nfirst place, but that's the best they can do....\"\n\n\"Tell them to forget the armada,\" said Jenkins, grinning. \"And anyway,\nthey've got things all wrong back at HQ.\" He brandished a huge roll\nof parchment, stricken through with the colors of the seven Medical\nServices of Hospital Earth. \"Take a look, my boy--the juiciest Medical\nServices Contract that's been written in three centuries--\" He tossed\nthe Contract in the dry-storage locker with a sigh. \"Old Kiz just\nfinished his first lesson, and he's still wondering what went on--\"\n\n\"So am I,\" said the Green Doctor suspiciously.\n\n\"It was simple. We cured His Eminence of the Pox.\"\n\n\"With what? Incantations?\"\n\n\"Oh, the incantations were for the _doctors_,\" said Jenkins. \"They\nexpected them, obviously, since that was the only level of medicine\nthey could understand. And incidentally, the only level that could\npossibly get us a Contract. Anyway, I couldn't do very much else, under\nthe circumstances, except for a little supportive therapy. Without a\nBio-survey we were hamstrung. But whatever the Pox is, it obviously\ninvolves fever, starvation and dehydration. I knew that His Eminence\ncould assimilate carbohydrates, and I took a long gamble that an\nantipyretic wouldn't hurt him too much--\"\n\nWally Stone's jaw sagged. \"So you treated him with sugar-water and\naspirin,\" he said weakly. \"And on that you risked our necks.\"\n\n\"Not quite,\" said the Red Doctor. \"You're forgetting that I had\none other prescription to use--the oldest, most trustworthy\nhealer-of-all-ills known to medicine, just as potent now as it was a\nthousand years ago. Without it, Hospital Earth might just as well pack\nup her little black bag and go home.\" He smiled into the mirror as he\nadjusted the scarlet band of the Red Service across his shoulders. \"We\ncall it Tincture of Time,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n",
