    "body": "It was a deathless world, but a woman was dying.\n\nAnne Tabor lay limp and pale, her long, slender limbs making only\nshallow depressions on the mercury bath which supported her. Webb\nFellow stood over her awaiting the effects of the sedative to relieve\nher pain.\n\nHis title was _Doctor_, but almost everyone in this age had an M. D.\ncertificate with several specialties to his credit. Webb Fellow was\nsimply one who continued to find interest and diversion in the field\nof physiological maintenance.\n\nHe stood tall and strong above her, lean-bellied, smooth-faced and calm\nappearing, yet he didn't feel especially calm. As the agony eased from\nAnne's face he spoke softly.\n\n\"I'm glad you came to me, Anne.\"\n\nShe moistened her lips and spoke without opening her eyes. \"It was\nyou or Clifford--and Cliff hasn't practiced for a century or more.\nIt's--it's quite important to me, Webb. I really want to live. Not\nbecause I'm afraid of dying, but....\"\n\n\"I know, Anne. I know.\"\n\nEveryone in Chicago knew. Anne Tabor was the first female of that city\nto be chosen for motherhood in almost a decade. And in the three days\nsince the news had flashed from Washington, Anne Tabor had generated\nwithin the blood-stream of her lovely, near-perfect body, a mutated\ncancerous cell that threatened to destroy her. Mutant leukemia!\n\n\"Just relax, dear. We have the whole city of Chicago to draw on for\nblood while we work this thing out.\"\n\nHe touched a cool hand to her fevered forehead, and the slight motion\nstirred the golden halo that her hair made on the silvery surface of\nthe mercury.\n\nThe word, \"dear\", echoed strangely in his ears once he had said it. Her\neyes had opened at the expression of sentiment, and now they were wide\nand blue as they examined him. A tiny smile curved her pale lips. \"Did\nI hear correctly?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear.\" He repeated the word deliberately, and for the first time\nsince his student days he felt the web of his emotions tighten and\ntwist into a knot of unreason.\n\nShe mustn't die ... not now!\n\nHer smile widened with her look of mild amazement. \"Why Webb, I do\nbelieve you mean it!\"\n\n\"You have always been high in my affections, Anne.\"\n\n\"Yes, but--_it's a long life_. Such a long life!\"\n\n_That damned phrase again!_ The essence of sanity, they called it. The\ncliche of cliches that under-scored this whole business of immortality.\n_Be not concerned for the frustrations of the moment. All obstacles are\ntransient--all obstacles and all emotions. The price of immortality is\ncaution, patience, temperance. Deep personal attachments lead to love,\nlove leads to jealousy, jealousy to un-saneness, insanity to violence_,\nviolence to--\n\nAll he had said was that she was high in his affections, but no one\nspoke of such things any more. When one did, it was considered that\nmore than conventional promiscuity was involved in his intentions.\n\nHe turned away abruptly and studied the dials that registered her\nblood-pressure, pulse and metabolism. Incredible how even women three\nhundred years old remained sensitive to the slightest sign of infantile\npassion in their men. And more fantastic yet, that he, Webb Fellow,\nof the original generation of immortals some seven hundred years old,\nshould find the destructive spark of possessiveness still alive in his\nsemantically adjusted nervous system.\n\nMechanically he noted the systole and diastole lines on the revolving\nchart and ordered an attendant to administer whole blood. Before he\nleft her he turned back for a moment. \"It shouldn't be more than 24\nhours, Anne, and I promise you there won't be any impairment of your\nmaternal capacity.\"\n\nHe was startled to note that tears welled into her eyes. \"Thank you,\nWebb. Clifford was worried that I might be disqualified.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! Clifford hasn't kept up on things.\" He strode away without\nfurther comment, but as he stepped from surgery into pathology he was\ntroubled. Why was Clifford so worried about her? Did Clifford think\nthat Anne would choose _him_ to father her child?\n\nThe thought struck like a snake. Before he could block it the fangs\nwere deep, and the venom of adolescent jealousy raced from brain to\nendocrines to blood-stream, poisoning his whole nervous system.\n\n_It's a long life!_\n\nHe resorted to the old antidote himself, despising his weakness as he\nbreathed the words. They came out as a sigh. He discovered that he was\nsearching his memory to determine whether he or Clifford could lay\nclaim to Anne by seniority.\n\nSeniority? What damned nonsense was that? Anne had traded back and\nforth between Clifford and him for at least 250 years--with uncounted,\ntrivial alliances with how many other men?\n\nBut the others didn't count. It was he and Clifford whom Anne\npreferred, just as he and Clifford had discussed on countless occasions\nAnne's perpetual attraction to them both. Anne _was_ Clifford's\nfavorite, and he'd made no secret of it.\n\n\"Over here, Webb. We have it!\" It was Porter, the head staff\npathologist holding out a small vial of crimson-clear liquid. \"This\nferric-protein salt should cure our famous lady quite quickly. It\nplayed sudden hell in the culture.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes? Fine. Thank you, Porter. Thank you very much!\"\n\nThe narrow-shouldered pathologist gave him a second look. \"Certainly.\nDon't mention it.\" He paused then asked bluntly, \"Did she name you for\npaternity?\"\n\nWebb managed to hold the vial steady to the light, but his voice was a\nshade too taut and high. \"Not yet--that is, we haven't discussed it.\nIt's a possibility, I suppose.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" Porter mocked gently. \"You with the highest\ngenetic-desirability rating in the State, give or take a couple of\ncounties.\"\n\nYes, there were a couple other males in Illinois with as high a genetic\nrating as Webb Fellow, and one of them was Clifford Ainsley.\n\nThe obvious question thrust itself upon Webb for the first time. Was\nthat why Anne Tabor had seemed to concentrate her favors upon him and\nClifford? Had she actually anticipated the eventuality of being chosen\nfor motherhood, and had her criterion for male companionship been\nsimply a high genetic rating?\n\n_It's a long life._ Even with such unlikely odds against the\ncontingency, he supposed any qualified female secretly nurtured the\nhope that someday--\n\nWith the inexplicable tension mounting in him he passed the vial along\nto an assistant with instructions for administering it. Anne would be\nin no condition to discuss the matter for another day or two.\n\nBut he must know. He must know whether she had already chosen Clifford.\n\nHe slipped into a light street-jacket, caught an express to top-side\nand engaged a taxi. His finger was poised over the destination dial\nbefore he realized with a start that he had forgotten the five-digit\nnumber for Clifford's address. It had been that long since he had\ncalled on his old friend.\n\nFriend? The concept seemed suddenly strange. How long since their\nfriendship had actually dissolved into an unacknowledged rivalry?\n\nNonsense. He and Clifford had both been uncommonly busy with their\nrespective professions. And since Clifford had branched from medicine\ninto robotics, their paths and interests had simply diverged.\nAlternating almost weekly between the two men, Anne Tabor had kept each\nmore or less informed of the other's activities, but somehow he and\nClifford had ceased looking each other up.\n\nThe directory gave him Clifford's number, and he dialed it. The small\nvehicle lifted quickly, slipped into the invisible traffic pattern and\nbegan applying the dialed code-address to the electronic grid that\ncross-hatched Chicago like a mammoth waffle. As traffic cluttered ahead\non one particular striation, the taxi banked smoothly and right-angled\nto the next parallel course and proceeded.\n\nNeat, safe, fool-proof. Perfect transportation within proscribed\ngeometrical limits, Webb thought. An infinite number of routes from\none point to another--like the course of a human life--but all within\ncertain proscribed limits.\n\n_It's a long life._\n\nThe course of a man's life could be considered a passage with infinite\npossibilities only if he were allowed to backtrack occasionally. Was\nthat what he was doing? Had life grown so dull that he was seeking the\ndiversion of immaturity again?\n\nImmortality.\n\nWas it really so important? Once there had been a time when love,\nopen, unashamed love had been accepted as one of life's strongest\nmotivations. And it wasn't just a feeling of jealous possessiveness.\nThere was a feeling of mutuality in it, a tenderness, an unselfishness\nand closeness of communion between man and woman.\n\nHow had this exalted condition become debased into the casual\nassociation that now existed between the sexes? Debased? That was a\nloaded term. What was the matter with him? Anne Tabor was a lovely,\ndesirable creature, but no more lovely, no more desirable than a\nhundred other females he knew.\n\nAn odd, almost unique feeling of shame swept over him as his cab sank\nto the landing strip on Clifford's apartment building. He must conceal\nhis state of mind from Clifford or be judged a complete imbecile.\n\n\n\n\"Well, Webb! This is a surprise.\" Cliff's face was entirely without\nemotion. \"Anne! It's about Anne, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Anne will be fine.\"\n\n\"Good, good! You startled me, standing there in the door like a\nmessenger of doom. I thought for a moment--well, things wouldn't be the\nsame without little Annie, would they?\"\n\nThey had moved into Cliff's apartment, and Webb shrugged out of his\njacket. The spacious quarters and expensive appointments reminded Webb\nof Clifford's wealth.\n\n\"The robot business must be thriving,\" Webb remarked. \"Anne didn't\nmention such luxury over here.\"\n\n\"The girl is tactful, my friend. Tactful, sweet, intelligent.\"\n\nWebb looked up quickly. He had seated himself, and Clifford stood\nbefore him in a stiff, almost challenging pose. \"Am I welcome here?\"\nthe physician asked bluntly.\n\n\"Certainly, certainly. We'll always welcome you here. Nothing need be\nchanged just because Anne is to have a child. Nothing, that is, except\nthe customary observance of monogamous convention until the child is\nborn and raised.\"\n\nA pound of lead sagged in Webb's stomach. \"Then--Anne has named you for\npaternity?\"\n\nClifford's slender, well-made body lost itself in the precise center of\nan over-size chair, he looked at Webb thoughtfully. \"Well, practically.\nWe were discussing it the other night when she had the first symptoms\nof this attack.\" He rubbed his hairless chin. \"Why? Did you especially\naspire to the noble station of parenthood?\"\n\nThe lazy sarcasm was salt in the wound. With difficulty, Webb kept\nhis face expressionless. \"When I heard the news, naturally I gave the\npossibility some consideration. That's why I came over here.\"\n\n\"I see. Anne didn't tell you.\"\n\n\"She was in considerable distress when they brought her in. I--I didn't\nask her.\"\n\nIn spite of the raven-black hair and youthful face, there was something\nabout Clifford that Webb didn't like, a hardness, a lack-luster\nindifference verging on boorishness. The thought of losing Anne\ncompletely for more than eighteen years to this man was more painful\neven than Webb had anticipated.\n\nImpulsively he said, \"For old time's sake, Cliff, will you do me a big\nfavor?\"\n\nThe engineer stared at him and waited.\n\n\"Take a vacation. Disappear for a few months.\"\n\nThe dark eyebrows remained in a straight line. \"And run out on Anne?\nYou aren't serious.\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\nClifford laughed without smiling. \"You'd better head for hormone harbor\nand take _yourself_ a vacation, old man. You're becoming senile.\"\n\n\"Then you won't withdraw?\"\n\n\"Of course not. You're asking more than a favor. You're asking me to\noffend Anne. These things are important to females.\"\n\n\"It's important to me, too, Cliff.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll be--\" The smaller man rolled to his feet and put his hands\non his hips. \"I never thought to see the day when honored Elder Webb\nFellow would come muling around like a sub-century freshman. Of all the\nanachronistic drivel!\"\n\n\"You see?\" Webb said eagerly, \"It isn't important to you at all. Why\ncan't you do this for me, Cliff? I--I just can't stand the thought of\nbeing without Anne all those years.\"\n\n\"Relax, Webb. _It's a long life._ Anne will be back in circulation\nbefore you know it.\" He paced to a low desk and extracted a small\naddress book from a drawer. \"If you're short of female acquaintances at\nthe moment you can have these. I won't be needing them for awhile.\"\n\nHe flipped the book at Webb. By chance the cover opened, caught the\nair and slanted the book up in its course so it struck the physician's\ncheek with a slap. The faint sting was the detonator that exploded all\nthe careful restraint of seven centuries.\n\nWebb arose to his feet slowly and moved toward Clifford. \"So\nmedicine was too elementary for you? Human physiology and behaviour\nhas no unsolved problems in it, you said once. So you went into\nrobotics--positronic brains--infinite variety of response, with built\nin neuroses and psychoses. Human behaviour was too stereo-typed for\nyou, Clifford. Everyone was predictable to seven decimal places. You\nwere bored.\"\n\n\"You have it about right,\" the engineer said insolently. He let his\narms drop to his sides, relaxed, unconcerned at the tension in the\nphysician's voice.\n\n\"You build fine chess-playing machines, I hear,\" Webb said softly,\ngradually closing the distance between them. \"Your mechanical geniuses\nhave outstripped our finest playwrights and novelists for creativity\nand originality. You've probed every conceivable aberrated twist of\nhuman nature with your psychological-probabilities computers. You've\nreduced sociology and human relations to a cipher--\"\n\nClifford shrugged. \"Merely an extension of early work in general\nsemantics--the same work that gave us mental stability to go with\nphysical immortality. Certainly you don't disparage--\"\n\n\"I'm disparaging nothing,\" Webb broke in. \"I'm merely pointing out your\nblind spot, your fatal blind spot.\"\n\n\"Fatal?\"\n\n\"Yes, Clifford, fatal. I'm going to kill you.\"\n\nThe words seemed to have no effect. Not until Webb's powerful surgeon's\nhands closed about his neck did Clifford go rigid and begin his futile\nstruggle.\n\nWebb did not crush the larynx immediately. He squeezed down with slow,\nbreath-robbing pressure, feeling for the windpipe under his thumbs.\nClifford gasped, \"_'Sa long life, Webb_ ... don't ... commit suicide.\"\n\n\"It's a long life, but not for you, my stupid friend. Sure, they'll\nexecute me. But you won't have her. Never again, do you hear?\"\n\nClifford's eyes were closed now, and Webb knew that the roaring in his\nvictim's ears would be blotting out all external sound. The knowledge\ninfuriated him, and he screamed, \"You fool, I pleaded with you. I took\nyour insults and gave you every clue you needed--didn't you recognize\nmy condition? You fool! You brilliant, blind fool!\"\n\nClifford collapsed to his knees, and Webb let him go with one final,\nirrevocable wrench that certified his death.\n\nClifford's death and his own. The penalty for murder was still capital\npunishment, and in his own case Webb acknowledged the logic and\nnecessity of such harsh consequences.\n\nIf there was one activity that immortal, 28th Century Man could no\nlonger afford, it was the luxury of falling in love....\n\n\n\nWebb stood back and looked down at his crumpled victim. The heavy\npressure was subsiding from his temples, and the gray film of\nirrational hate faded from his vision.\n\n\"Cliff--I--\" Then full horror closed in on him and he choked off. His\nhands felt slick and slippery, but it was his own sweat, not blood. The\ntactile memory of his fingers squeezing, crushing Clifford's throat,\nfed details of touch, texture and temperature to his tortured but\nclear brain. His surgeon's fingers were twitching, trying to tell him\nwhat they had discovered moments ago, but a more over-whelming thought\nblocked the message.\n\n_I've taken a man's life ... and my own. And ruined Anne's happiness.\nI've brought her tragedy instead of happiness._\n\nNo, not tragedy. Inconvenience. It would still be a long life for Anne.\nShe would find a suitable mate, then her child would quickly erase the\nmemory of this day.\n\nStill, he had committed murder, the first deliberate murder the world\nhad known in centuries. \"Damn you!\" he screamed down at the body. \"Why\ndidn't you protect yourself?\"\n\n\"Oh, I did, Webb, I did!\"\n\nWebb spun to face the direction of the voice behind him. His eyes\nmust be playing tricks--an after-image, perhaps. \"Who are you?\" Webb\ndemanded.\n\n\"Clifford Ainsley. The prototype, that is, in the flesh and not a\nroboid.\" He nodded at the body on the floor. \"Ainsley the Second.\nStrictly a lab job.\"\n\n\"Cliff? Oh, my God!\" Webb fell into a chair and sobbed with relief.\n\nClifford Ainsley came to him and put a hand to his shoulder. \"I'm truly\nsorry, Webb, but it was better this way. We can be thankful that I\nanticipated your actions.\"\n\nWebb looked up. \"You--expected me to murder you?\"\n\n\"The p c--probability computation--was remarkably high. You see, I ran\nyour genetic pattern into the computer, added the double stress factor\nof Anne's serious illness _and_ her forthcoming motherhood, and the\nsubtotal spelled out a four letter word.\"\n\nWebb nodded slowly. \"Love.\"\n\n\"Right. And you know the corollary to that. When I punched in the\ndetails of your relationship with Anne _and_ me, well, the next\nsubtotal read--homicide.\"\n\nThe expression of relief in Webb's face changed to show the hurt he\nfelt. \"But if you knew all this, why did you have to play out this\nscene, even with a remote control robot?\"\n\n\"To discharge the murder impulse, my friend. I had to play it straight,\nreacting just as I would to your demands, had I not known of your\ncondition. Otherwise the computations would have been based on false\ninter-reaction premises. And until you made the attempt on my life, you\nwere a real danger to me--and yourself. Now the shock of your murder\nattempt and the relief at your failure have dissipated that danger.\"\n\nIt was true, Webb admitted to himself. No longer did he feel the least\nmalice toward Cliff. But bitterness was still rank on his tongue. \"So\nhow does the story end? Does boy get girl or not?\"\n\n\"Of course. Boy always gets girl, if he wants her. _It's a long life._\nAt this phase she wants me.\"\n\n\"Is that your own opinion or just another subtotal of the computer?\"\n\n\"Both.\"\n\n\"But--how does it really end. What happens when you punch the _total_\nkey?\"\n\n\"You ask that, Webb? You, one of the very first to embrace the rigors\nof physical immortality? My dear friend, _there is no total key_.\"\n\n\n\n\n",
