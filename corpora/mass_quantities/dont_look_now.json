    "body": "The man in the brown suit was looking at himself in the mirror behind\nthe bar. The reflection seemed to interest him even more deeply than the\ndrink between his hands. He was paying only perfunctory attention to\nLyman\u2019s attempts at conversation. This had been going on for perhaps\nfifteen minutes before he finally lifted his glass and took a deep\nswallow.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look now,\u201d Lyman said.\n\nThe brown man slid his eyes sidewise toward Lyman; tilted his glass\nhigher, and took another swig. Ice-cubes slipped down toward his mouth.\nHe put the glass back on the red-brown wood and signaled for a refill.\nFinally he took a deep breath and looked at Lyman.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at what?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cThere was one sitting right beside you,\u201d Lyman said, blinking rather\nglazed eyes. \u201cHe just went out. You mean you couldn\u2019t see him?\u201d\n\nThe brown man finished paying for his fresh drink before he answered.\n\u201cSee who?\u201d he asked, with a fine mixture of boredom, distaste and\nreluctant interest. \u201cWho went out?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat have I been telling you for the last ten minutes? Weren\u2019t you\nlistening?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly I was listening. That is\u2014certainly. You were talking\nabout\u2014bathtubs. Radios. Orson\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot Orson. H. G. Herbert George. With Orson it was just a gag. H. G.\n_knew_\u2014or suspected. I wonder if it was simply intuition with him? He\ncouldn\u2019t have had any proof\u2014but he did stop writing science-fiction\nrather suddenly, didn\u2019t he? I\u2019ll bet he knew once, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cKnew what?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout the Martians. All this won\u2019t do us a bit of good if you don\u2019t\nlisten. It may not anyway. The trick is to jump the gun\u2014with proof.\nConvincing evidence. Nobody\u2019s ever been allowed to produce the evidence\nbefore. You _are_ a reporter, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n\nHolding his glass, the man in the brown suit nodded reluctantly.\n\n\u201cThen you ought to be taking it all down on a piece of folded paper. I\nwant everybody to know. The whole world. It\u2019s important. Terribly\nimportant. It explains everything. My life won\u2019t be safe unless I can\npass along the information and make people believe it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t your life be safe?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of the Martians, you fool. They own the world.\u201d\n\nThe brown man sighed. \u201cThen they own my newspaper, too,\u201d he objected,\n\u201cso I can\u2019t print anything they don\u2019t like.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never thought of that,\u201d Lyman said, considering the bottom of his\nglass, where two ice-cubes had fused into a cold, immutable union.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not omnipotent, though. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re vulnerable, or why\nhave they always kept under cover? They\u2019re afraid of being found out. If\nthe world had convincing evidence\u2014look, people always believe what they\nread in the newspapers. Couldn\u2019t you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHa,\u201d said the brown man with deep significance.\n\nLyman drummed sadly on the bar and murmured, \u201cThere must be some way.\nPerhaps if I had another drink....\u201d\n\nThe brown suited man tasted his collins, which seemed to stimulate him.\n\u201cJust what is all this about Martians?\u201d he asked Lyman. \u201cSuppose you\nstart at the beginning and tell me again. Or can\u2019t you remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I can remember. I\u2019ve got practically total recall. It\u2019s\nsomething new. Very new. I never could do it before. I can even remember\nmy last conversation with the Martians.\u201d Lyman favored the brown man\nwith a glance of triumph.\n\n\u201cWhen was that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can even remember conversations I had last week,\u201d the brown man said\nmildly. \u201cSo what?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. They make us forget, you see. They tell us what\nto do and we forget about the conversation\u2014it\u2019s post-hypnotic\nsuggestion, I expect\u2014but we follow their orders just the same. There\u2019s\nthe compulsion, though we think we\u2019re making our own decisions. Oh, they\nown the world, all right, but nobody knows it except me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how did you find out?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I got my brain scrambled, in a way. I\u2019ve been fooling around with\nsupersonic detergents, trying to work out something marketable, you\nknow. The gadget went wrong\u2014from some standpoints. High-frequency\nwaves, it was. They went through and through me. Should have been\ninaudible, but I could hear them, or rather\u2014well, actually I could see\nthem. That\u2019s what I mean about my brain being scrambled. And after that,\nI could see and hear the Martians. They\u2019ve geared themselves so they\nwork efficiently on ordinary brains, and mine isn\u2019t ordinary any more.\nThey can\u2019t hypnotize me, either. They can command me, but I needn\u2019t\nobey\u2014now. I hope they don\u2019t suspect. Maybe they do. Yes, I guess they\ndo.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way they look at me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do they look at you?\u201d asked the brown man, as he began to reach for\na pencil and then changed his mind. He took a drink instead. \u201cWell? What\nare they like?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I can see them, all right, but only when they\u2019re dressed\nup.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d the brown man said patiently. \u201cHow do they look, dressed\nup?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust like anybody, almost. They dress up in\u2014in human skins. Oh, not\nreal ones, imitations. Like the Katzenjammer Kids zipped into crocodile\nsuits. Undressed\u2014I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never seen one. Maybe they\u2019re\ninvisible even to me, then, or maybe they\u2019re just camouflaged. Ants or\nowls or rats or bats or\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOr anything,\u201d the brown man said hastily.\n\n\u201cThanks. Or anything, of course. But when they\u2019re dressed up like\nhumans\u2014like that one who was sitting next to you awhile ago, when I\ntold you not to look\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat one was invisible, I gather?\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of the time they are, to everybody. But once in a while, for some\nreason, they\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d the brown man objected. \u201cMake sense, will you? They dress up in\nhuman skins and then sit around invisible?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly now and then. The human skins are perfectly good imitations.\nNobody can tell the difference. It\u2019s that third eye that gives them\naway. When they keep it closed, you\u2019d never guess it was there. When\nthey want to open it, they go invisible\u2014like _that_. Fast. When I see\nsomebody with a third eye, right in the middle of his forehead, I know\nhe\u2019s a Martian and invisible, and I pretend not to notice him.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d the brown man said. \u201cThen for all you know, I\u2019m one of your\nvisible Martians.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I hope not!\u201d Lyman regarded him anxiously. \u201cDrunk as I am, I don\u2019t\nthink so. I\u2019ve been trailing you all day, making sure. It\u2019s a risk I\nhave to take, of course. They\u2019ll go to any length\u2014any length at all\u2014to\nmake a man give himself away. I realize that. I can\u2019t really trust\nanybody. But I had to find someone to talk to, and I\u2014\u201d He paused. There\nwas a brief silence. \u201cI could be wrong,\u201d Lyman said presently. \u201cWhen the\nthird eye\u2019s closed, I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s there. Would you mind opening\nyour third eye for me?\u201d He fixed a dim gaze on the brown man\u2019s forehead.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cSome other time. Besides, I don\u2019t know you.\nSo you want me to splash this across the front page, I gather? Why\ndidn\u2019t you go to see the managing editor? My stories have to get past\nthe desk and rewrite.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to give my secret to the world,\u201d Lyman said stubbornly. \u201cThe\nquestion is, how far will I get? You\u2019d expect they\u2019d have killed me the\nminute I opened my mouth to you\u2014except that I didn\u2019t say anything while\nthey were here. I don\u2019t believe they take us very seriously, you know.\nThis must have been going on since the dawn of history, and by now\nthey\u2019ve had time to get careless. They let Fort go pretty far before\nthey cracked down on him. But you notice they were careful never to let\nFort get hold of genuine proof that would convince people.\u201d\n\nThe brown man said something under his breath about a human interest\nstory in a box. He asked, \u201cWhat do the Martians do, besides hang around\nbars all dressed up?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still working on that,\u201d Lyman said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy to understand.\nThey run the world, of course, but why?\u201d He wrinkled his brow and stared\nappealingly at the brown man. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they do run it, they\u2019ve got a lot to explain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean. From our viewpoint, there\u2019s no sense to it. We do\nthings illogically, but only because they tell us to. Everything we do,\nalmost, is pure illogic. Poe\u2019s _Imp of the Perverse_\u2014you could give it\nanother name beginning with M. Martian, I mean. It\u2019s all very well for\npsychologists to explain why a murderer wants to confess, but it\u2019s still\nan illogical reaction. Unless a Martian commands him to.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be hypnotized into doing anything that violates your moral\nsense,\u201d the brown man said triumphantly.\n\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n\nLyman frowned. \u201cNot by another human, but you can by a Martian. I expect\nthey got the upper hand when we didn\u2019t have more than ape-brains, and\nthey\u2019ve kept it ever since. They evolved as we did, and kept a step\nahead. Like the sparrow on the eagle\u2019s back who hitch-hiked till the\neagle reached his ceiling, and then took off and broke the altitude\nrecord. They conquered the world, but nobody ever knew it. And they\u2019ve\nbeen ruling ever since.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTake houses, for example. Uncomfortable things. Ugly, inconvenient,\ndirty, everything wrong with them. But when men like Frank Lloyd Wright\nslip out from under the Martians\u2019 thumb long enough to suggest something\nbetter, look how the people react. They hate the thought. That\u2019s their\nMartians, giving them orders.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook. Why should the Martians care what kind of houses we live in? Tell\nme that.\u201d\n\nLyman frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t like the note of skepticism I detect creeping\ninto this conversation,\u201d he announced. \u201cThey care, all right. No doubt\nabout it. They _live_ in our houses. We don\u2019t build for our convenience,\nwe build, under order, for the Martians, the way they want it. They\u2019re\nvery much concerned with everything we do. And the more senseless, the\nmore concern.\n\n\u201cTake wars. Wars don\u2019t make sense from any human viewpoint. Nobody\nreally wants wars. But we go right on having them. From the Martian\nviewpoint, they\u2019re useful. They give us a spurt in technology, and they\nreduce the excess population. And there are lots of other results, too.\nColonization, for one thing. But mainly technology. In peace time, if a\nguy invents jet-propulsion, it\u2019s too expensive to develop commercially.\nIn war-time, though, it\u2019s got to be developed. Then the Martians can use\nit whenever they want. They use us the way they\u2019d use tools or\u2014or\nlimbs. And nobody ever really wins a war\u2014except the Martians.\u201d\n\nThe man in the brown suit chuckled. \u201cThat makes sense,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\nmust be nice to be a Martian.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not? Up till now, no race ever successfully conquered and ruled\nanother. The underdog could revolt or absorb. If you know you\u2019re being\nruled, then the ruler\u2019s vulnerable. But if the world doesn\u2019t know\u2014and\nit doesn\u2019t\u2014\n\n\u201cTake radios,\u201d Lyman continued, going off at a tangent. \u201cThere\u2019s no\nearthly reason why a sane human should listen to a radio. But the\nMartians make us do it. They like it. Take bathtubs. Nobody contends\nbathtubs are comfortable\u2014for us. But they\u2019re fine for Martians. All the\nimpractical things we keep on using, even though we know they\u2019re\nimpractical\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTypewriter ribbons,\u201d the brown man said, struck by the thought. \u201cBut\nnot even a Martian could enjoy changing a typewriter ribbon.\u201d\n\nLyman seemed to find that flippant. He said that he knew all about the\nMartians except for one thing\u2014their psychology.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know _why_ they act as they do. It looks illogical sometimes,\nbut I feel perfectly sure they\u2019ve got sound motives for every move they\nmake. Until I get that worked out I\u2019m pretty much at a standstill. Until\nI get evidence\u2014proof\u2014and help. I\u2019ve got to stay under cover till then.\nAnd I\u2019ve been doing that. I do what they tell me, so they won\u2019t suspect,\nand I pretend to forget what they tell me to forget.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019ve got nothing much to worry about.\u201d\n\nLyman paid no attention. He was off again on a list of his grievances.\n\n\u201cWhen I hear the water running in the tub and a Martian splashing\naround, I pretend I don\u2019t hear a thing. My bed\u2019s too short and I tried\nlast week to order a special length, but the Martian that sleeps there\ntold me not to. He\u2019s a runt, like most of them. That is, I think they\u2019re\nrunts. I have to deduce, because you never see them undressed. But it\ngoes on like that constantly. By the way, how\u2019s your Martian?\u201d\n\nThe man in the brown suit set down his glass rather suddenly.\n\n\u201cMy Martian?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow listen. I may be just a little bit drunk, but my logic remains\nunimpaired. I can still put two and two together. Either you know about\nthe Martians, or you don\u2019t. If you do, there\u2019s no point in giving me\nthat, \u2018What, _my_ Martian?\u2019 routine. I know you have a Martian. Your\nMartian knows you have a Martian. My Martian knows. The point is, do\n_you_ know? Think hard,\u201d Lyman urged solicitously.\n\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n\n\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t got a Martian,\u201d the reporter said, taking a quick drink.\nThe edge of the glass clicked against his teeth.\n\n\u201cNervous, I see,\u201d Lyman remarked. \u201cOf course you _have_ got a Martian. I\nsuspect you know it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would I be doing with a Martian?\u201d the brown man asked with dogged\ndogmatism.\n\n\u201cWhat would you be doing without one? I imagine it\u2019s illegal. If they\ncaught you running around without one they\u2019d probably put you in a pound\nor something until claimed. Oh, you\u2019ve got one, all right. So have I. So\nhas he, and he, and he\u2014and the bartender.\u201d Lyman enumerated the other\nbarflies with a wavering forefinger.\n\n\u201cOf course they have,\u201d the brown man said. \u201cBut they\u2019ll all go back to\nMars tomorrow and then you can see a good doctor. You\u2019d better have\nanother dri\u2014\u201d\n\nHe was turning toward the bartender when Lyman, apparently by accident,\nleaned close to him and whispered urgently,\n\n\u201c_Don\u2019t look now!_\u201d\n\nThe brown man glanced at Lyman\u2019s white face reflected in the mirror\nbefore them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any Mar\u2014\u201d\n\nLyman gave him a fierce, quick kick under the edge of the bar.\n\n\u201cShut up! One just came in!\u201d\n\nAnd then he caught the brown man\u2019s gaze and with elaborate unconcern\nsaid, \u201c\u2014so naturally, there was nothing for me to do but climb out on\nthe roof after it. Took me ten minutes to get it down the ladder, and\njust as we reached the bottom it gave one bound, climbed up my face,\nsprang from the top of my head, and there it was again on the roof,\nscreaming for me to get it down.\u201d\n\n\u201c_What?_\u201d the brown man demanded with pardonable curiosity.\n\n\u201cMy cat, of course. What did you think? No, never mind, don\u2019t answer\nthat.\u201d Lyman\u2019s face was turned to the brown man\u2019s, but from the corners\nof his eyes he was watching an invisible progress down the length of the\nbar toward a booth at the very back.\n\n\u201cNow why did he come in?\u201d he murmured. \u201cI don\u2019t like this. Is he anyone\nyou know?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs who\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat Martian. Yours, by any chance? No, I suppose not. Yours was\nprobably the one who went out a while ago. I wonder if he went to make a\nreport, and sent this one in? It\u2019s possible. It could be. You can talk\nnow, but keep your voice low, and stop squirming. Want him to notice we\ncan see him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see him. Don\u2019t drag me into this. You and your Martians can\nfight it out together. You\u2019re making me nervous. I\u2019ve got to go,\nanyway.\u201d But he didn\u2019t move to get off the stool. Across Lyman\u2019s\nshoulder he was stealing glances toward the back of the bar, and now and\nthen he looked at Lyman\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cStop watching me,\u201d Lyman said. \u201cStop watching him. Anybody\u2019d think you\nwere a cat.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy a cat? Why should anybody\u2014do I look like a cat?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were talking about cats, weren\u2019t we? Cats can see them, quite\nclearly. Even undressed, I believe. They don\u2019t like them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho doesn\u2019t like who?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhom. Neither likes the other. Cats can see Martians\u2014sh-h!\u2014but they\npretend not to, and that makes the Martians mad. I have a theory that\ncats ruled the world before Martians came. Never mind. Forget about\ncats. This may be more serious than you think. I happen to know my\nMartian\u2019s taking tonight off, and I\u2019m pretty sure that was your Martian\nwho went out some time ago. And have you noticed that nobody else in\nhere has his Martian with him? Do you suppose\u2014\u201d His voice sank. \u201cDo you\nsuppose they could be _waiting for us outside_?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Lord,\u201d the brown man said. \u201cIn the alley with the cats, I suppose.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stop this yammer about cats and be serious for a moment?\u201d\nLyman demanded, and then paused, paled, and reeled slightly on his\nstool. He hastily took a drink to cover his confusion.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter now?\u201d the brown man asked.\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d Gulp. \u201cNothing. It was just that\u2014he _looked_ at me.\nWith\u2014you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me get this straight. I take it the Martian is dressed in\u2014is\ndressed like a human?\u201d\n\n\u201cNaturally.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s invisible to all eyes but yours?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. He doesn\u2019t want to be visible, just now. Besides\u2014\u201d Lyman paused\ncunningly. He gave the brown man a furtive glance and then looked\nquickly down at his drink. \u201cBesides, you know, I rather think you can\nsee him\u2014a little, anyway.\u201d\n\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n\nThe brown man was perfectly silent for about thirty seconds. He sat\nquite motionless, not even the ice in the drink he held clinking. One\nmight have thought he did not even breathe. Certainly he did not blink.\n\n\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d he asked in a normal voice, after the\nthirty seconds had run out.\n\n\u201cI\u2014did I say anything? I wasn\u2019t listening.\u201d Lyman put down his drink\nabruptly. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go now.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d the brown man said, closing his fingers around Lyman\u2019s\nwrist. \u201cNot yet you won\u2019t. Come back here. Sit down. Now. What was the\nidea? Where were you going?\u201d\n\nLyman nodded dumbly toward the back of the bar, indicating either a\njuke-box or a door marked MEN.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel so good. Maybe I\u2019ve had too much to drink. I guess I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re all right. I don\u2019t trust you back there with that\u2014that\ninvisible man of yours. You\u2019ll stay right here until he leaves.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going now,\u201d Lyman said brightly. His eyes moved with great\nbriskness along the line of an invisible but rapid progress toward the\nfront door. \u201cSee, he\u2019s gone. Now let me loose, will you?\u201d\n\nThe brown man glanced toward the back booth.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cHe isn\u2019t gone. Sit right where you are.\u201d\n\nIt was Lyman\u2019s turn to remain quite still, in a stricken sort of way,\nfor a perceptible while. The ice in _his_ drink, however, clinked\naudibly. Presently he spoke. His voice was soft, and rather soberer than\nbefore.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. He\u2019s still there. You can see him, can\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nThe brown man said, \u201cHas he got his back to us?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou _can_ see him, then. Better than I can maybe. Maybe there are more\nof them here than I thought. They could be anywhere. They could be\nsitting beside you anywhere you go, and you wouldn\u2019t even guess,\nuntil\u2014\u201d He shook his head a little. \u201cThey\u2019d want to be _sure_,\u201d he\nsaid, mostly to himself. \u201cThey can give you orders and make you forget,\nbut there must be limits to what they can force you to do. They can\u2019t\nmake a man betray himself. They\u2019d have to lead him on\u2014until they were\nsure.\u201d\n\nHe lifted his drink and tipped it steeply above his face. The ice ran\ndown the slope and bumped coldly against his lip, but he held it until\nthe last of the pale, bubbling amber had drained into his mouth. He set\nthe glass on the bar and faced the brown man.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d he said.\n\nThe brown man looked up and down the bar.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting late,\u201d he said. \u201cNot many people left. We\u2019ll wait.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait for what?\u201d\n\nThe brown man looked toward the back booth and looked away again\nquickly.\n\n\u201cI have something to show you. I don\u2019t want anyone else to see.\u201d\n\nLyman surveyed the narrow, smoky room. As he looked the last customer\nbeside themselves at the bar began groping in his pocket, tossed some\nchange on the mahogany, and went out slowly.\n\nThey sat in silence. The bartender eyed them with stolid disinterest.\nPresently a couple in the front booth got up and departed, quarreling in\nundertones.\n\n\u201cIs there anyone left?\u201d the brown man asked in a voice that did not\ncarry down the bar to the man in the apron.\n\n\u201cOnly\u2014\u201d Lyman did not finish, but he nodded gently toward the back of\nthe room. \u201cHe isn\u2019t looking. Let\u2019s get this over with. What do you want\nto show me?\u201d\n\nThe brown man took off his wrist-watch and pried up the metal case. Two\nsmall, glossy photograph prints slid out. The brown man separated them\nwith a finger.\n\n\u201cI just want to make sure of something,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst\u2014why did you\npick me out? Quite a while ago, you said you\u2019d been trailing me all day,\nmaking sure. I haven\u2019t forgotten that. And you knew I was a reporter.\nSuppose you tell me the truth, now?\u201d\n\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n\nSquirming on his stool, Lyman scowled. \u201cIt was the way you looked at\nthings,\u201d he murmured. \u201cOn the subway this morning\u2014I\u2019d never seen you\nbefore in my life, but I kept noticing the way you looked at things\u2014the\nwrong things, things that weren\u2019t there, the way a cat does\u2014and then\nyou\u2019d always look away\u2014I got the idea you could see the Martians too.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo on,\u201d the brown man said quietly.\n\n\u201cI followed you. All day. I kept hoping you\u2019d turn out to be\u2014somebody I\ncould talk to. Because if I could _know_ that I wasn\u2019t the only one who\ncould see them, then I\u2019d know there was still some hope left. It\u2019s been\nworse than solitary confinement. I\u2019ve been able to see them for three\nyears now. Three years. And I\u2019ve managed to keep my power a secret even\nfrom them. And, somehow, I\u2019ve managed to keep from killing myself, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree years?\u201d the brown man said. He shivered.\n\n\u201cThere was always a little hope. I knew nobody would believe\u2014not\nwithout proof. And how can you get proof? It was only that I\u2014I kept\ntelling myself that maybe you could see them too, and if you could,\nmaybe there were others\u2014lots of others\u2014enough so we might get together\nand work out some way of proving to the world\u2014\u201d\n\nThe brown man\u2019s fingers were moving. In silence he pushed a photograph\nacross the mahogany. Lyman picked it up unsteadily.\n\n\u201cMoonlight?\u201d he asked after a moment. It was a landscape under a deep,\ndark sky with white clouds in it. Trees stood white and lacy against the\ndarkness. The grass was white as if with moonlight, and the shadows\nblurry.\n\n\u201cNo, not moonlight,\u201d the brown man said. \u201cInfra-red. I\u2019m strictly an\namateur, but lately I\u2019ve been experimenting with infra-red film. And I\ngot some very odd results.\u201d\n\nLyman stared at the film.\n\n\u201cYou see, I live near\u2014\u201d The brown man\u2019s finger tapped a certain quite\ncommon object that appeared in the photograph. \u201c\u2014and something funny\nkeeps showing up now and then against it. But only with infra-red film.\nNow I know chlorophyll reflects so much infra-red light that grass and\nleaves photograph white. The sky comes out black, like this. There are\ntricks to using this kind of film. Photograph a tree against a cloud,\nand you can\u2019t tell them apart in the print. But you can photograph\nthrough a haze and pick out distant objects the ordinary film wouldn\u2019t\ncatch. And sometimes, when you focus on something like this\u2014\u201d He tapped\nthe image of the very common object again, \u201cyou get a very odd image on\nthe film. Like that. A man with three eyes.\u201d\n\nLyman held the print up to the light. In silence he took the other one\nfrom the bar and studied it. When he laid them down he was smiling.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Lyman said in a conversational whisper, \u201ca professor of\nastrophysics at one of the more important universities had a very\ninteresting little item in the _Times_ the other Sunday. Name of\nSpitzer, I think. He said that, if there were life on Mars, and if\nMartians had ever visited earth, there\u2019d be no way to prove it. Nobody\nwould believe the few men who saw them. Not, he said, unless the\nMartians happened to be photographed....\u201d\n\nLyman looked at the brown man thoughtfully.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s happened. You\u2019ve photographed them.\u201d\n\nThe brown man nodded. He took up the prints and returned them to his\nwatch-case. \u201cI thought so, too. Only until tonight I couldn\u2019t be sure.\nI\u2019d never seen one\u2014fully\u2014as you have. It isn\u2019t so much a matter of\nwhat you call getting your brain scrambled with supersonics as it is of\njust knowing where to look. But I\u2019ve been seeing _part_ of them all my\nlife, and so has everybody. It\u2019s that little suggestion of movement you\nnever catch except just at the edge of your vision, just out of the\ncorner of your eye. Something that\u2019s _almost_ there\u2014and when you look\nfully at it, there\u2019s nothing. These photographs showed me the way. It\u2019s\nnot easy to learn, but it can be done. We\u2019re conditioned to look\ndirectly at a thing\u2014the particular thing we want to see clearly,\nwhatever it is. Perhaps the Martians gave us that conditioning. When we\nsee a movement at the edge of our range of vision, it\u2019s almost\nirresistible not to look directly at it. So it vanishes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen they can be seen\u2014by anybody?\u201d\n\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot in a few days,\u201d the brown man said. \u201cSince I took\nthose photographs. You have to train yourself. It\u2019s like seeing a trick\npicture\u2014one that\u2019s really a composite, after you study it. Camouflage.\nYou just have to learn how. Otherwise we can look at them all our lives\nand never see them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe camera does, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, the camera does. I\u2019ve wondered why nobody ever caught them this\nway before. Once you see them on film, they\u2019re unmistakable\u2014that third\neye.\u201d\n\n\u201cInfra-red film\u2019s comparatively new, isn\u2019t it? And then I\u2019ll bet you\nhave to catch them against that one particular background\u2014you know\u2014or\nthey won\u2019t show on the film. Like trees against clouds. It\u2019s tricky. You\nmust have had just the right lighting that day, and exactly the right\nfocus, and the lens stopped down just right. A kind of minor miracle. It\nmight never happen again exactly that way. But ... don\u2019t look now.\u201d\n\nThey were silent. Furtively, they watched the mirror. Their eyes slid\nalong toward the open door of the tavern.\n\nAnd then there was a long, breathless silence.\n\n\u201cHe looked back at us,\u201d Lyman said very quietly. \u201cHe looked at us ...\nthat third eye!\u201d\n\nThe brown man was motionless again. When he moved, it was to swallow the\nrest of his drink.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that they\u2019re suspicious yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThe trick will be\nto keep under cover until we can blow this thing wide open. There\u2019s got\nto be some way to do it\u2014some way that will convince people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s proof. The photographs. A competent cameraman ought to be able\nto figure out just how you caught that Martian on film and duplicate the\nconditions. It\u2019s evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvidence can cut both ways,\u201d the brown man said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m hoping is\nthat the Martians don\u2019t really like to kill\u2014unless they have to. I\u2019m\nhoping they won\u2019t kill without proof. But\u2014\u201d He tapped his wrist-watch.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two of us now, though,\u201d Lyman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stick\ntogether. Both of us have broken the big rule\u2014_don\u2019t look now_\u2014\u201d\n\nThe bartender was at the back, disconnecting the juke-box. The brown man\nsaid, \u201cWe\u2019d better not be seen together unnecessarily. But if we both\ncome to this bar tomorrow night at nine for a drink\u2014that wouldn\u2019t look\nsuspicious, even to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuppose\u2014\u201d Lyman hesitated. \u201cMay I have one of those photographs?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf one of us had\u2014an accident\u2014the other one would still have the\nproof. Enough, maybe, to convince the right people.\u201d\n\nThe brown man hesitated, nodded shortly, and opened his watch-case\nagain. He gave Lyman one of the pictures.\n\n\u201cHide it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014evidence. I\u2019ll see you here tomorrow.\nMeanwhile, be careful. Remember to play safe.\u201d\n\nThey shook hands firmly, facing each other in an endless second of\nfinal, decisive silence. Then the brown man turned abruptly and walked\nout of the bar.\n\nLyman sat there. Between two wrinkles in his forehead there was a stir\nand a flicker of lashes unfurling. The third eye opened slowly and\nlooked after the brown man.",
