He mentally concluded that she\nhad been waiting on the porch for the game to finish.\n\nShe wore a picture-hat, carried a parasol and was extremely cool, as\nwas attested by her manner as she drew a chair up to his table and\nsaid:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Charlie Laurie\u2019s only daughter.\u201d\n\nHad the California sky fallen upon the links, Fay would not have\nbeen more surprised. Charlie Laurie was serving fifty years in the\nIsolation Section of Dannemora for the crime, committed against the\ndignity of New York State, of forcing open a national bank, seizing\nthe contents of the vault and escaping to Argentina, where he was\nlater turned up by a former pal.\n\nThis man, as Fay recalled him in that long minute of his stare\nacross the table, was bulky, rough-voiced and disfigured by a giant\nscar which ran from the lobe of his right ear down to, and under,\nhis chin. The girl who now professed to be his daughter resembled\nhim in no particular.\n\n\u201cSome mistake,\u201d Fay said, rising gallantly. \u201cI\u2019m sure that you have\ntaken me for some one else.\u201d\n\nThe girl lifted her elbows from the table, opened her parasol,\nraised it and asked:\n\n\u201cWont you sit down? I haven\u2019t mistaken you for some one else. You\nare Chester Fay, alias Edward Letchmere--an old friend of my\nfather\u2019s.\u201d\n\nFay took off his plaid cap and sat down. He fingered a\nplatinum-and-gold cigarette-case, removed a monogrammed cigarette,\nscratched a match on the bottom of the table and inhaled a deep\nbreath of Turkish-scented smoke.\n\n\u201cBy what other name was your father known?\u201d he tested her.\n\n\u201cHe was sometimes called \u2018Big Scar\u2019!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere were you born?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Chi. I was with Micky Gleason\u2019s mob in Paris. I worked deep-sea\nwith Minnie May, \u2018The Duchess.\u2019 I have been trained by my father to\ndip, forge, stall for pennyweighting and ever so many useful\nthings.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look it!\u201d Fay exclaimed. \u201cUpon my word I don\u2019t believe\nyou\u2019re Charlie Laurie\u2019s daughter. Why, he is hardly your kind--at\nall.\u201d\n\n\u201cLaying aside compliments, Mr. Fay, and how I found where you were\nhere in California and--so many things that take up time, I\u2019ve got a\nproposition to make which should be mutually advantageous. In other\nwords you are the only man in the world I would let in on a great,\nbig job.\u201d\n\nFay removed his cigarette from his mouth and eyed the ashes. He ran\nhis slender fingers through his prematurely gray hair. His face\nlighted with retrospection.\n\n\u201cGo on Miss--\u201d\n\n\u201cSaidee Isaacs, they call me, although you know my name is Saidee\nLaurie.\u201d\n\n\u201cProceed, Miss Isaacs, with your plan.\u201d\n\nThe girl\u2019s olive-shaped and tinted eyes swept the golf-links. She\nbrushed back a lock of sherry-colored hair.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to help you crack a safe,\u201d she informed him, \u201cThe\nsafe--or goopher, as Father would call it--is in the brokerage\noffice of Frank Robertson Pope, otherwise known in California\nget-rich-quick circles as \u2018The Black Cougar.\u2019\u201d\n\nFay crushed his cigarette. A film dropped over his eyes. His lips\nhardened to a straight line.\n\n\u201cGo on,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou know the man?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know him!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe deserves no mercy?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is a disgrace to all the good crooks in the world--a coward and\na hypocrite. He has served time--for usury. He got out of San\nQuentin by squealing on his pals. He is trimming suckers right and\nleft. He makes suicides of widows. He fills the poorhouses. He is\nwithin the law--but far guiltier than you or I.\u201d\n\nFay realized that he faced a very well-informed young woman. He\nmoistened his lips and gazed over the golf-links. No one was within\ndriving distance of the Nineteenth Hole.\n\n\u201cBriefly,\u201d he suggested, \u201cyou believe me to be Chester Fay, an old\nfriend of your father\u2019s. You located this Chester Fay through the\nunderworld. You want him to help you turn off a trick on \u2018The Black\nCougar.\u2019 What would there be in it for him if this trick were\nsuccessfully turned?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne hundred thousand for him and the same for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow is the goopher protected?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy every known electrical device. It is in the back of his office.\nIt consists of three layers of vanadium steel and two layers of\nfireproofing. The circular door has two dials and a time-lock. The\ninner door has one dial. The day door has a flat-key lock.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is above the vault?\u201d\n\n\u201cA photograph studio.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is in the basement?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe basement is occupied by a cigar-store. It doesn\u2019t close until\ntwelve o\u2019clock. There\u2019s a pool-room in the back. Sometimes men play\npoker there all night.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many watchmen in the building?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne, employed by \u2018The Black Cougar.\u2019 He can\u2019t be bought. I\u2019ve\ntried.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe regular thing, then--watchman, electric protection, standard\nvault built by Seaber, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo--by Terryton!\u201d\n\n\u201cA good box, but soft on top.\u201d\n\nThe girl tilted her parasol so that her face was in a shadow.\n\n\u201cAre you game?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cThe proposition strikes me as being peculiar. Suppose I am Chester\nFay. How do I know that you are Charlie Laurie\u2019s daughter?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould this convince you?\u201d The girl reached in her breast and laid a\nfolded photograph on the table. Fay picked it up. It was a good\nlikeness taken in a rogues\u2019 gallery. A tag with a number was about\nthe girl\u2019s neck. Her eyes were straight before her. Beneath the card\nwas the notation:\n\n\u201cSaidee Laurie, _alias_ Saidee Isaacs, _alias_ English Kitty.\nShoplifter, gun-moll, con-woman, gay-cat for Continental mobs of\nsafe-blowers and card-sharpers. Sentences, suspended each instance:\nAuburn, N. Y., Rochester Workhouse, Rochester, N. Y., Bridewell,\nChicago, Ill.\u201d\n\nFay turned the card over, then handed it back.\n\n\u201cRather convincing,\u201d he said. \u201cFrankly, you don\u2019t look it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you going to help me?\u201d\n\nFay traced circles on the iron table-top. He stared at his golf-bag.\nHe considered the situation from a score of angles. The thing that\nswayed him and inclined him toward the proposition was the fact that\n\u201cThe Black Cougar\u201d was fair game for any self-respecting crook.\n\n\u201cI make one stipulation,\u201d he said, finally. \u201cBuy out the photograph\ngallery and establish yourself above the vault. I\u2019ll advance the\nmoney.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have the money. I had already figured on that,\u201d was the girl\u2019s\nreply.\n\n\u201cYou seem to have thought of most things. Do you know that if that\nvault is taken by either an electric-arc or an oxy-acetylene\nblow-pipe, I will be suspected?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a fact! You see the police and the private agencies know a\nman by his work. How can we take that vault in a new way? How can I\ngo through three layers of vanadium steel?\u201d\n\n\u201cHas it ever been done?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, by the introduction of graduated blasts of nitroglycerin.\u201d\n\n\u201cFather would have opened the safe that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour father was of the old school. The presence of a watchman, the\npoker-players in the basement, the natural suspicion which \u2018The\nBlack Cougar\u2019 will have concerning his ill-gotten gains, calls for a\nnew idea--one that will be effective and noiseless. Can you think of\na way?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. That\u2019s why I came to see you.\u201d\n\nFay crossed his legs and leaned away from the table. The girl\u2019s face\nwas still in the shadow cast by her parasol. Again the thought came\nto him that the whole proposition was a trick. Perhaps she was a\ntool in the employ of \u201cThe Black Cougar.\u201d Perhaps the police had\nsent her to Short Hills in order to arrange a trap. He dismissed\nthis thought, however. The police of Los Angeles would have been\nanxious to make a quick arrest. The price on his head amounted to\nfive figures.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll chance you!\u201d he said. \u201cThe only motive I see for your actions\nis the one you\u2019ve explained. You want to rob a robber--cheat a\ncheater. Frank Robertson Pope, which is only one of \u2018The Black\nCougar\u2019s\u2019 names, has amassed too much money, in too rotten a way. I\nunderstand he has the longest and most complete sucker-list of any\nbucket-shop broker in this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can steal that and sell it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are people who would buy it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know a very well-known firm in New York and Washington that would\npay fifty thousand dollars for the list.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps that is all Pope has in the vault?\u201d\n\nThe girl dropped her parasol to the turf, rose, leaned over the\ntable and said:\n\n\u201cIf that _were_ all, would you still be game enough to try it?\u201d\n\nFay stood erect. He pulled on his cap, pocketed his cigarette-case\nand smiled down at Saidee Isaacs.\n\n\u201cAfter thinking the matter over--I will do anything in my power to\nbeat \u2018The Black Cougar.\u2019 He is within the law and you and I are\noutside the law. But I\u2019ll take my chances against his, on Judgment\nDay.\u201d\n\nSaidee Isaacs thrust out an impulsive hand.\n\n\u201cI like you immensely for saying that, Chester Fay. I knew I\u2019d like\nyou--from what Father told me. You see I visited him when I was\nEast, last week. He gave me directions how to find you here at Short\nHills.\u201d\n\nFay recalled a letter which he had written to Charlie Laurie. In it\nhad been a code telling where to send an answer. There was very\nlittle danger in doing this, for prison guards were notoriously\nstupid.\n\n\u201cThat explains everything I wanted to know,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had\nbetter hurry to Los Angeles and secure that studio.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already looked it over. I can buy all of the fixtures and\nassume the lease. I\u2019ll set up a Miss Sorjoni, Photographer of\nChildren. You\u2019ll have until day-after-tomorrow to find out a way to\ncut down through the vault.\u201d\n\n               *       *       *       *       *\n\nFay watched the girl cross the lawn to the clubhouse, where she\nentered a taxi which was waiting under the _porte-coch\u00e8re_. The taxi\ndisappeared over the dusty surface of a winding road that led to Los\nAngeles, via Pasadena.\n\nHe wasted no time. Picking up his golf-bag, he strode lankily to the\nshowers, bathed, took the small elevator to his room and there\nchanged his clothes. He went to Los Angeles, by trolley. His costume\nwas calculated to disarm any suspicion. A closely woven Panama hat\nshaded his features. A plaid suit and square-toed shoes gave him the\nappearance of a remittance-man in town for the theater.\n\nOf Robertson Pope, otherwise \u201cThe Black Cougar,\u201d he learned\nconsiderable. The bucket-shop operator lived in an Italian-period\npalace on one of the principal avenues given over to motion-picture\nmagnates, oil-boomers and actresses. Pope had a string of seventy\nbranch offices extending from San Diego to Boston, Mass. The\nGovernment, through the Post Office Department, had recently been\ndefeated in the higher courts by \u201cThe Black Cougar\u2019s\u201d attorneys. It\nhad been proved that his business was legitimate.\n\nFay stayed in Los Angeles that night and went over the record in the\nBuilding Inspector\u2019s Office the next morning. He was able to do this\nby posing as an architect in search of villa specifications. He\ntraced on rice-paper, a working drawing of the building wherein Pope\nhad his main office. The floor plans gave the location of the\nphotograph studio, the construction of the ceilings and the\nthickness of the walls. A skylight was shown above the studio.\n\nHe rounded out a day\u2019s hard work and went back to Short Hills. The\nplan he had in mind took slow form. Many details depended on Saidee\nIsaacs.\n\n               *       *       *       *       *\n\nA phone call from her studio, the next afternoon, brought him from\nthe golf-links.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just moved in,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything is topsy-turvy. Wont you\nbring little Cecil tomorrow? I\u2019ll have my camera up then. Good-by.\u201d\n\n\u201cTalks like a man,\u201d thought Fay. \u201cSnappy and direct.\u201d\n\nHe passed the day considering the plan of relieving \u201cThe Black\nCougar\u201d of his available wealth. The bucket-shop operator was\nshrewder than most men of his type. He was a crook, at heart. Fay\nrealized that no one, not excepting millionaires, raised a louder\noutcry when robbed than a thief himself. Old Charlie Laurie had once\nsaid, \u201cThe poor man never squeals when trimmed, but look out for the\nbig grafters.\u201d\n\nFay\u2019s precautions when visiting the studio consisted in wearing a\nbaggy, tweed suit, yellow gloves and sun-glasses. He found a child\nwho could play the part of \u201cCecil\u201d for the first visit.\n\nSaidee Isaacs had accomplished the impossible. A new sign was hung\nin the place of the old one. New curtains were at the front windows.\nGrass matting covered the floor of the reception-room. The camera\nshe had set up between the studio and the dark-room was a fair\nimitation of a good one. It was covered with a black cloth.\n\n\u201cThis is all right,\u201d Fay said to her. \u201cBut there\u2019s one thing to be\nchanged. That skylight has got to be moved south about seven feet.\u201d\nHe consulted the rice-paper tracing while the boy sat in the\nreception-room.\n\n\u201cWhy has it got to be moved?\u201d\n\nFay pointed to the floor of the photographing-room. \u201cThe vault is in\nthe wrong place. We can\u2019t move it. We have got to move the\nskylight.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas the skylight anything to do with cutting through the top of the\nsafe?\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything, Saidee.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen it\u2019ll be moved where you say, if a carpenter can do it.\u201d\n\nThe other tenants of the Bradock Building, so called from a stone\nover the doorway to \u201cThe Black Cougar\u2019s\u201d brokerage offices, had\nample opportunity to observe Miss Saidee Sorjoni, Photographer of\nChildren. She wore shiny celluloid cuffs and a neat white ruching\nabout her neck. Her fingers were stained with developer. Beneath\nthis yellow stain was a coating of collodium--a sovereign cure for\nfingerprints.\n\nThe boy, whom Fay had picked up in the street, held down the\nposition of messenger. He could be sent on almost any kind of\npretext. He had an innocent though dirty face, that disarmed\nsuspicion.\n\nFay took his time in cutting through the floor over the exact center\nof \u201cThe Black Cougar\u2019s\u201d customers\u2019 room--a place of wire-wickets,\ntickers, soft chairs and a long board upon which two boys changed\nthe day\u2019s quotations with lightning-like celerity.\n\nThe hole he made through the floor of the studio\u2019s front office was\ncone-shaped and ended in a quarter-inch opening. A view could be\nobtained by means of this peekhole of \u201cThe Black Cougar\u2019s\u201d private\nden--adjoining the vault.\n\nFay neatly fitted this opening with a trapdoor covered by a small\ntable. Upon this he placed current magazines and samples of\nphotographic art--left by the late owner of the studio.\n\n\u201cCome here, Saidee,\u201d he said to her one day. \u201cGet down and watch\nPope. What is he doing at his desk? What is that he has carried from\nthe vault?\u201d\n\nShe dropped to her knees and looked through the opening. She bent\nlower. Suddenly she rose and arranged her skirt.\n\n\u201cThat is queer,\u201d she said. \u201cHe took a large spool of wire out of the\nvault, set it on a spindle, passed one end of the wire through a\nlittle box he has on his desk and then started winding the wire on\nanother spool. He\u2019s doing it now.\u201d\n\nFay lay flat on the grass matting. He saw, through the circular\nopening, the board-room, the grill and ground-glass partitions and\nthe thick purple neck and bald head of \u201cThe Black Cougar.\u201d The\nbucket-shop operator was doing nothing more interesting than winding\nwire from one spool to another. He stopped now and then to examine a\ntape which came out of the box on his desk. He reached suddenly. He\ntore off this tape, pulled down the cover of his desk, sprang from\nhis swivel-chair and went to a window which opened into the\ncompartment occupied by a score of stenographers.\n\n\u201cPetroleum, preferred,\u201d he snarled as a timid girl took the tape.\n\u201cSend them Red Letter No 10. Follow up, one day week. Quote 6574\nasked. Get me?\u201d\n\nThe girl whispered her answer. She disappeared beyond Fay\u2019s range of\nvision. He waited and watched \u201cThe Black Cougar\u201d unwind the wire,\ntuck the spool under his thick arm and hurry into the vault. An\ninner door slammed. The bucket-shop operator came out, closed the\nouter door, twirled the combinations and started pacing the thick\nTurkish rug.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a new one,\u201d said Fay to Saidee Isaacs. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to open\nthat vault to find out what that spool of wire is for!\u201d\n\n\u201cCould it have been an electrical connection to the little box on\nhis desk?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! It was not insulated wire. It looked to me like fine steel or\niron wire--perhaps finer than the wire used in the smallest size\nhairpin.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe spool was big enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was all of a thousand feet of wire on it, Saidee.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s some trick.\u201d\n\nFay nodded. He got down on his knees and watched \u201cThe Black Cougar.\u201d\nHe rose and covered up the hole in the floor. Before going out he\nsaid to the girl:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have some things sent up. Tonight I start work over\nthe safe. We shall enter the vault by Sunday, when no one is in\nPope\u2019s office.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow are you going to cut that vanadium steel? Father told me once\nit was the hardest kind of metal.\u201d\n\nFay glanced at the skylight which had been changed to a new\nposition. \u201cI told you,\u201d he smiled, \u201cthat I had an idea. It\u2019s so far\nout of my line that the police wont suspect me. I\u2019ve been accused of\nusing thermite, the oxy-acetylene blow-pipe, the electric-arc, with\na water-rheostat, and other devices. This time I\u2019ll go everybody one\nbetter. The material will be up by special messenger.\u201d\n\nFay left the studio. His thoughts were not on the method he intended\nusing to open \u201cThe Black Cougar\u2019s\u201d strong box. They drifted between\ntwo mysteries--the matter-of-factness of Saidee Isaacs, who was\ncertainly unemotional, and the spool of wire which Pope had locked\nin the vault.\n\n               *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe shop Fay visited that afternoon, and where he waited while a\nglazier finished the last of his order, was far enough from the\ncenter of the city to admit of no danger from the police.\n\n\u201cYou see,\u201d Fay told the proprietor, \u201cI am making some experiments at\nan ostrich farm near Pasadena. Be careful when you pack the mirrors.\nI\u2019ll have to carry them on a trolley-car.\u201d\n\nHe took a huge, well-wrapped package after paying the man the price\ndemanded, and rounded the block. He found a messenger standing in\nfront of a telegraph-office.\n\n\u201cFor Miss Saidee Sorjoni, photographer,\u201d he told the boy. \u201cShe\u2019s\nlocated in the Bradock Building. Here\u2019s a four-bit piece. Don\u2019t\nbreak anything.\u201d\n\nFay watched the boy until he had disappeared. He went through narrow\nstreets to a second glazier\u2019s. This man had constructed two halves\nof a hollow lens. This lens was about three feet in diameter. It was\nfar from being accurate.\n\n\u201cA burning-glass,\u201d said Fay, \u201cdoes not necessarily need to be solid.\nI intend to paste the edges together with plaster of Paris and fill\nthe whole thing with clear water.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoing to make a sun-motor?\u201d asked the artisan.\n\n\u201cSomething like that. Wrap it in tissue paper. I don\u2019t want to break\nit on my way to Pasadena.\u201d\n\nHaving thus thrown off all clues, Fay carried the hollow lens to the\nstudio. Saidee Isaacs had received the package, left it unopened on\nthe dark-room floor and pinned a brief note to the table in the\nreception-room.\n\n\u201cGone for the day. Have a headache. Will be at my hotel if you want\nto call me up.\u201d\n\nFay destroyed the note, took off his coat, tie and collar and\nstarted to work rigging the mirrors and the hollow lens upon a\nscaffolding beneath the skylight.\n\nIt was shortly after midnight when he finished adjusting the device\nto his satisfaction. He went to the window, peered out, saw the\nnight-watchman talking with a uniformed policeman on the\nstreet-corner, and smiled with some slight degree of satisfaction.\n\nThe hole he cut directly over the vault and beneath the scaffolding\nwas aimed to miss two floor-beams which he had located by a line of\nnail-heads. He reached, before dawn, the first and upper plate of\nvanadium steel which protected the vault. He cleared a square space\nand emptied the plaster and shavings in a box.\n\nA neat trapdoor, hinged on the lower side, was the work of a silent\nhour wherein he used screws instead of nails on the hinges. He\ncovered the floor with a matting, swept out the corners for chance\nevidence and washed up.\n\nThe arrangement of mirrors, the hollow lens, which had not yet been\nfilled with water, the adjustable scaffolding beneath the skylight,\nall resembled a part of a photograph outfit designed to intensify\nthe overhead rays of the California sun. The lens reminded Fay of a\nlarge goldfish bowl.\n\nSaidee Isaacs came in at seven o\u2019clock. She looked at the\nscaffolding, removed her gloves, lifted her broad-brimmed hat from\nher sherry-colored hair and exclaimed:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the limit! I thought I\u2019d got in the wrong studio.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working all night, Saidee.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is that thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cAn up-to-date method of cutting steel--particularly vanadium,\nchrome or high-carbon stuff. It\u2019s new in the history of\nsafe-breaking. There\u2019s nothing like being original--even in your\nsinning.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut will it work?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you at noon. Lock the front door, pull down the blinds,\nand if the boy comes send him away. We\u2019re going to cop \u2018The Black\nCougar\u2019s\u2019 bank-roll by Sunday. All we\u2019ll leave him is the\nrubber-band.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m curious about that spool of iron wire, Chester.\u201d\n\n\u201cSame here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why he should lock up a ridiculous thing like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got the reputation of being very clever. He\u2019s been an\nusurer--for the underworld. He\u2019s a telegraph operator and an\nelectrician of sorts. I think he was mixed up with Larry Anderson\nand \u2018Blondie\u2019 in a phantom-circuit around a pool-room\u2019s fast wire. I\nexpected to find the vault protected on top, but they overlooked\nthat. Queer, isn\u2019t it, that a clever man like him--a fiend for money\nand a brain-worker of the first class--should neglect an important\ntrifle?\u201d\n\nSaidee Isaacs said: \u201cThey all overlook the essential trifle. We must\nbe careful we don\u2019t overlook anything. I\u2019m not afraid of the police\nhalf as much as \u2018The Black Cougar.\u2019\u201d\n\nFay glanced at the matting over the trapdoor. \u201cYou\u2019re sure there\u2019s\ngoing to be two hundred thousand in the vault?\u201d\n\n\u201cHis last statement given to the post-office authorities showed that\nmuch, or more, balance. He also has money with the Coast National.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was in the newspapers three weeks ago when the trial was going\non.\u201d\n\nFay was satisfied with the girl\u2019s answer. He heard her moving around\nin the dark-room. He rolled the grass matting to one side and lifted\nthe trapdoor over the vault.\n\nThe bright sunlight illuminated the room. A beam reflected from the\nmirrors on the scaffolding. The city roared beyond the locked door.\n\nFay drew a piece of blue chalk from his pocket, knelt down on the\nvanadium steel plate and carefully outlined an oblong--three feet\nlong and two feet wide. He rose and stared at his design. He went to\nwork filling the hollow lens with water. Saidee mixed the plaster of\nParis. The edges were quickly sealed. A small opening was left at\nthe top. Through this aperture the air rushed out as the liquid ran\nin. This hole was finally stopped with chewing-gum.\n\n\u201cUseful stuff,\u201d said the girl. \u201cWith that and a hairpin you could\nfix anything.\u201d\n\nFay climbed upon the table and adjusted the hollow lens. He blocked\none edge so that it could be shifted. He raised and lowered the\nframe upon which it rested. A sudden flash, followed by a small\ncloud of smoke, indicated that the focused rays had touched the\nwoodwork at the edge of the trapdoor.\n\n\u201cHotter than any electric-arc,\u201d he said. \u201cNow watch when I get the\npoint of light on the vanadium. This is the same scheme old\nArchimedes used centuries ago to burn ships.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought he used mirrors--\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps he did. I\u2019ve got mirrors to heat the vanadium and keep the\ntemperature of the plate high. Our chief difficulty will be in the\nloss of heat due to radiation. The--\u201d\n\nSaidee Isaacs sprang back from the opening. A sizzling sounded. Blue\nsmoke filled the room. The plate was being melted along the line Fay\nhad drawn. The movement of the sun, from east to west, was changing\nthe position of the ray.\n\nFay climbed to the table and adjusted his curved mirrors. He focused\nthem about the spot of whiter light that coned down from the hollow\nlens. The California sun is bright. The skylight did not require\nopening.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting on!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019ve gone through the first plate\nand reached the fireproofing. I\u2019ll have to change the lens and spot\nacross the oblong. My east and west lines are easy. The cross lines\nwill take some time.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about the heat melting the paint in the vault?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe asbestos layers between the plates will prevent that. See! We\nwere lucky that \u2018The Black Cougar\u2019s\u2019 was both fireproof and\nburglar-proof. But then, Saidee, they make them all that way.\u201d\n\nThe girl shielded her eyes and leaned over the opening in the floor.\nA narrow channel showed where the spot of light had cut through the\nfirst vanadium plate. The fused metal formed bubbles along the\nedges. Beneath the bubbles was the white fireproofing material.\n\nFay pulled her back. \u201cLook out for that ray,\u201d he said. \u201cI estimate\nits temperature to be all of five thousand degrees Fahrenheit.\nThat\u2019ll melt anything--particularly high-carbon steel.\u201d\n\n\u201cCould you have done the same thing with the oxy-acetylene\nblow-torch?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! You have to have an edge to start on. All we had here was a\nflat plate. This is the only way we could have done it. The\nelectric-arc requires a heavy amperage--far more than can be\nobtained from a lamp-circuit. Besides, the coppers would suspect me\nif I used an arc.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to think this was done by electricity.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, they\u2019re not. We\u2019ll leave the mirrors behind us. It\u2019ll throw\nthem off my trail.\u201d\n\nSaidee went out at noon and returned with two lunches bought at a\nrestaurant. She found Fay standing on the table and holding the lens\nso that it spotted tiny blisters first along the north, then south,\nlines of the oblong. The sun went behind a cloud. Fay sprang to the\nfloor lightly. He sat down, turned in his chair, and stared at the\ntop of the vault. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the first plate pretty well cut\nthrough,\u201d he said. \u201cSuppose you look and see what \u2018The Black Cougar\u2019\nis doing.\u201d\n\nShe rose and dusted her knees after a long study of the operator\u2019s\noffice.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got that spool of iron wire on his desk. He\u2019s been running it\nthrough the little box. There\u2019s a lot of tape scattered about. It\nmust be a quotation machine of some kind, Chester.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. The days of the old swindle are gone. He couldn\u2019t get away with\nfake quotations. He may have a fast wire and a slow wire in his\noffices. The customer trades on the slow wire while the firm sells\non the fast wire. But then, I understand \u2018The Black Cougar\u2019s\u2019\nbusiness is done mostly through the mails. That spool he has down\nthere has something to do with his mail game. Maybe it\u2019s a system to\nbeat the market.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere never will be such a thing!\u201d\n\nFay nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re very wise,\u201d he mused, staring directly at her.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t remind me of your old man, at all. He did a lot of very\nheavy work--such as blasting and using a can-opener. You inherited\nyour quick-wittedness from your mother\u2019s side, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cPartly.\u201d\n\nFay went to work with the lens as the sun came out. He finished the\nfirst cutting by two o\u2019clock. He lifted the plate out, after\nallowing it to cool. It was three quarters of an inch in thickness.\nIts edges were brittle as glass.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll cut away the fireproofing,\u201d he told Saidee, \u201cand get ready for\nthe sun tomorrow. I expect, from what I know of the Terryton boxes,\nthat the middle plate will be almost twice as thick as the outer\none. That means a lot of burning.\u201d\n\nSaidee Isaacs attended to the meals. She watched the studio door in\ncase of interruption. Once Fay saw her adjust the shade at a certain\nheight. This shade could be seen from the street.\n\nHe recalled an old signal used by house prowlers to indicate that it\nwas all right for pals to enter the house. The thought flashed\nthrough him that the girl had a confederate outside. He puzzled over\nthis matter, without speaking to her about it. There seemed no\nreason to suspect treachery on her part.\n\nHer interest in robbing \u201cThe Black Cougar\u201d reached a high point when\nhe succeeded, after two days\u2019 work, in cutting out the second, or\ncentral, plate of the vault. This plate was an inch and a quarter in\nthickness. It was designed to resist drills. It was hardened on the\nsurface and somewhat soft inside.\n\nThe fumes and smoke from the burning metal floated through the\nskylight. The heat of the hot spot was sufficient to vaporize most\nmetal. Fay added to this heat the radiations from the concave\nmirrors. He feared, at times, that there would be indication inside\nthe vault that work was going on above.\n\nSaidee, on watch over the peekhole, kept him informed of \u201cThe Black\nCougar\u2019s\u201d movements. The bucket-shop operator had not used the spool\nof wire for two days. He had entered the vault but twice. Each time\nhe came out with yellow bills in his hands.\n\n\u201cTomorrow\u2019s Saturday,\u201d said Saidee. \u201cThat\u2019s a half-holiday for\nbrokers. There wont be anybody in the office during the afternoon or\nSunday. We must go through the last plate and get that money.\u201d\n\nFay washed up and put on his coat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll attend to our getaway,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll bring a lot of tourist\nfolders and lay them around the reception-room. They\u2019ll all indicate\nto the average sleuth that we fled to Seattle and from there took an\nAlaskan boat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a dick in this town who wouldn\u2019t fall for that,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cThe detectives I\u2019ve met are a lot of boobs. There\u2019s only one\nor two in the Secret Service who are any good.\u201d\n\n\u201cOld Triggy Drew?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and Marway--the man who was never seen by a criminal.\u201d\n\nFay opened the door.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of him,\u201d he said going out.\n\nThe railroad and steamship folders were secured. Saidee\u2019s inspection\nof her room at the hotel, and a general search of the photograph\nstudio for overlooked clues, left Saturday and Sunday for work. It\nwas that period of the California summer when the sun is brightest.\nThe girl reported the office below clear of clerks and customers.\nThe janitress came and scrubbed up. The watchman made his rounds.\nThe time-lock on the vault\u2019s outer door had been set by \u201cThe Black\nCougar\u201d so that no one could open it until Monday morning.\n\nFay took the chance. He went through the inner plate Saturday\nafternoon. He burned a larger hole, set the lens and allowed the\nhigh swing of the overhead sun to trace out a line. Smoke and vapor\nrose from the sizzling pencil of light. Drops of molten metal fell\nwithin the vault, the floor of which was not carpeted.\n\n               *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe job was finished soon after noon on Sunday. Fay looped a wire\naround the plate and tapped its edges with a hammer. The last of the\nmetal cracked. The plate swung free. The way was open.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go down!\u201d exclaimed Saidee.\n\n\u201cNo, not yet. Let the things cool off. Help me get the lens apart.\nWe\u2019ll destroy it. We\u2019ll clean up everything incriminating.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut--\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be in such a hurry. The vault may be \u2018bugged\u2019 inside. Suppose\nthere\u2019s an electric mat?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you know best! But I\u2019m very anxious.\u201d\n\nFay took his time. He coolly moved to the front window, raised the\nblind an inch and looked out. Autos and trolley-cars hurried by.\nPolicemen stood directing traffic. Tourists thronged the street.\n\nHe went to Saidee Isaacs. She helped him lift down the lens. He\npoured out the water, smashed the two halves with the hammer, and\ntossed the fragments into a box.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll never suspect what that was,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, give me your\nhand and lower me into the vault. I can\u2019t touch the edges yet.\nThey\u2019re still hot!\u201d\n\nShe braced herself over the opening, grasped his wrists, and lowered\nhim. Her strength was considerable. He felt her face close to his\nown as she leaned.\n\n\u201cLet go,\u201d he said, steadying his legs.\n\nHe landed on the metal floor of the vault. The light that streamed\nthrough the jagged opening was sufficient for his purpose. He\nstarted removing ledgers and cash-boxes to the center of the\nstrong-room. Some, but not all, of these boxes contained money. It\ntook him ten minutes, no longer, to count up the spoil.\n\nAllowing for small bills and silver, he had obtained thirty-seven\nthousand dollars. He had expected two hundred thousand.\n\nHe bundled up the larger packages of bills, snapped rubber-bands\nabout them and began a search of the shelves. He overlooked nothing.\nBook after book was torn apart.\n\nHaving finished with the last ledger, he stared up at Saidee\u2019s\nintent face framed in the jagged opening.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fine pal!\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve only got thirty-seven grand.\nYou\u2019ve steered me wrong!\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you found the sucker-list?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook around. It must be there. He probably had no copy. He wouldn\u2019t\ntrust anybody with a copy. It is far more important than the money.\u201d\n\nFay coolly tossed up the bundle of bank-bills. He hesitated.\n\n\u201cLook again--it\u2019s not here,\u201d she said. \u201cLook on the shelves. See if\nthere isn\u2019t a secret panel, or something.\u201d\n\nFay had already searched for any break in the metal of the vault. It\nwas smooth and enameled. He regarded the remaining objects.\n\n\u201cThe spools of iron wire are here.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive one of them to me. Put it in my hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very heavy. We might as well leave them.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! We must not overlook a single thing. Hand me a spool. I can\nlift it.\u201d\n\nFay poised a heavy spool between his fingers. Saidee drew it through\nthe opening. He waited until she lowered a short piece of\nclothes-line. He went up this, hooked his knee over the edge of the\nplate, and rose to her side.\n\n\u201cWe might as well split the money two ways and go,\u201d he said coldly.\n\u201cI\u2019m not exactly satisfied. I should never have gone into this\nthing. We\u2019ve smeared things up. We\u2019ve left more or less of a trail\nand gotten very little for our trouble.\u201d\n\nSaidee sat on the floor. She started searching through the torn\nbooks. Now and then she glanced at Fay without saying anything.\nDisappointment stamped her features when she finished. She projected\nthe package of money toward him with a sharp kick.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all yours, Chester!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m not that kind of a man. But you\u2019re a foolish little moll.\nHere we\u2019ve gone and laid ourselves open to twenty years in stir for\nnext to nothing. We haven\u2019t even put a dent in \u2018The Black Cougar\u2019s\u2019\nbank-roll. The chances are that he transferred most of his\nill-gotten gains to the Coast National Bank.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll I wanted was the sucker-list. That would have put him out of\nbusiness. He has about twenty thousand preferred names of boobs in\nthis country who will bite at anything.\u201d\n\nFay scraped the collodium from his finger-tips. He washed his hands,\nwent through the studio rooms, looked everywhere for possible\nleft-over clues, and then said:\n\n\u201cCome on. I\u2019ll carry the money. We might as well leave here.\u201d\n\nShe reached down and lifted the spool of iron wire. \u201cYou take the\nmoney and I\u2019ll take this,\u201d she said at the door. \u201cWe\u2019ll separate. I\nmay have to come back here--so give me the key.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d\n\nFay caught a direct stare full of meaning. \u201cYou\u2019re not a boob,\nthough you fell like one. My name isn\u2019t Saidee Laurie. It\u2019s Saidee\nIsaacs of the Secret Service, Post Office Department, at present. We\nintercepted your note to Charlie Laurie at Dannemora. They had me\ndecipher your rather simple code. The order was out to bring you in.\nI had been working on \u2018The Black Cougar\u2019 case. I thought you might\nbe of more help outside than inside. So I posed as Charlie Laurie\u2019s\ndaughter and got you to help me rob the vault. The rogues\u2019 gallery\npicture was framed up to make things more convincing.\u201d\n\nFay\u2019s eyes flashed.\n\n\u201cYou see,\u201d went on Saidee Isaacs, \u201cthe importance of getting \u2018The\nBlack Cougar\u2019s\u2019 sucker-list overshadowed the importance of putting\nan end to your activities. There was no way, through the law, that\nwould stop the bucket-shop operator. He had the list, and as long as\nit was in his possession, he could trim the suckers. They\u2019d buy\nanything, and they wouldn\u2019t squeal on him.\u201d\n\nFay blurted: \u201cWell, in that case you\u2019ve lost and I have gained.\nThirty-seven thousand isn\u2019t going back to him, nor is it going to\nthe Government. I\u2019m going to keep it--for professional services.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s yours, Chester. The police have been pulled off this job. You\ncan go free.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about the sucker-list? Who\u2019s coming back here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI may bring Marway. I may not need to bring him.\u201d\n\nSaidee lifted the heavy spool from her knee, \u201cAfter you,\u201d she said.\n\u201cOpen the door for me. Go out to the golf-club and wait.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll wait about twenty minutes!\u201d he exclaimed hotly. \u201cI suppose\nMarway will order me pinched.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in charge of the entire case. I\u2019ve failed so far--unless--\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis spool contains part of the sucker-list. I don\u2019t see how it\ncan. Do you?\u201d\n\nFay jerked the door open, allowed the girl to pass through, and\nlocked it. He thrust the key into her hand.\n\n\u201cGood-by,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo. Promise you will wait on the links for me. You have my word you\nwont be pinched.\u201d\n\nHis packing of the two kit-bags in his room at the club took no\nlonger than fifteen minutes. He paid his bill, left his bags with a\nporter, and went out on the links.\n\nGolfers, a fair gallery, and caddies were scattered over the green.\nHe sat down at a table and pulled out his watch. The California sun\nwas sinking over the Coast Range when a taxi churned through the\ndust, swung under the _porte-coch\u00e8re_ and discharged Saidee Isaacs.\n\nShe crossed the turf with her face as inscrutable as ever. Her hand\ndarted over the table. Shading her eyes with her parasol, she\nwhispered:\n\n\u201cSorry to keep you waiting, Chester, but we found the sucker-list.\nPart was in that spool. Marway\u2019s assistant found it ten minutes\nago.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy experimentation. I told Marway what I had seen \u2018The Black\nCougar\u2019 doing at his desk. You remember he ran the wire through a\nticker-machine and the tape came out printed with dots and dashes?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know they were dots and dashes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. He\u2019s a telegraph operator--an old Phillips code man. His\nstenographers could read Morse like print.\u201d\n\nFay began to see the purpose of the wire.\n\n\u201cThe sucker-list,\u201d continued Saidee, \u201cis magnetized in the fine wire\nthat is wound about the spools. Each few inches contains a name and\naddress in dots and dashes. The Black Cougar had an apparatus to\nmagnetize the wire. Marway\u2019s assistant said this apparatus probably\nconsisted of a small solenoid through which the wire was drawn at\nthe beginning. A touch of a key would make a dot. A longer touch\nmade a dash. The wire was special--hard and capable of being made\ninto a permanent magnet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen he could read these same dots and dashes by running the wire\nthrough the relay-ticker on his desk?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. That part of the idea has been used in duplex telegraphy and\nin seeing-over-a-wire-apparatus. You can find it in the technical\nbooks.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did Marway demonstrate it?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy a small pocket-compass. It\u2019s really very ingenious and simple.\n\u2018The Black Cougar\u2019 kept his whole sucker-list on the spools. He has\nno copy of it. He is beaten without it. He might as well go out of\nbusiness. Marway and the assistant operative are going to mail every\nsucker on the list a warning letter authorized by the Government.\nSome of them will get wise.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut most of them will fall for another swindler.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did our part--pulled \u2018The Black Cougar\u2019s\u2019 claws.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I pulled the chestnuts for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThirty-seven thousand dollars and the satisfaction of knowing you\ndid a good deed in a wicked world is no chestnut.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going East on the first train tonight, Saidee.\u201d\n\n\u201cStay around. Marway would like to meet you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought he had never been seen by a criminal?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a criminal. You only think you are.\u201d\n\nFay leaned over the table.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a dub,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI\u2019ll let you put it all over me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I let you go free with my best wishes,\u201d said Saidee Isaacs.\n\u201cTurn for turn, Chester. Don\u2019t write to prisons and give your\naddress in code lettering. I had orders to come here and arrest\nyou--about a week ago.\u201d\n\nFay flushed. She was gone across the short-cropped turf.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a dub,\u201d he repeated, \u201cand yet I wouldn\u2019t have had it happen any\nother way for the world.\u201d\n\n\n                               The End",
