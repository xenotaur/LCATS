    "body": "At last she was on the gangplank, entering the mouth of the\nspaceship--and nothing could ever stop her now. Not unless she broke\ndown completely in front of all these hurrying, Moon-bound passengers,\nin plain sight of the scattered crowd which clustered on the other\nside of the space-field barriers. Even that possibility was denied her\nwhen two gently insistent middle-aged ladies indicated she was blocking\nthe way....\n\nSomehow, dizzily, she was at her seat, led there by a smiling,\nbrown-clad stewardess; and her azure-tipped fingers were clutching at\nthe pearl-gray plasta-leather of the chair arm. Her eyes, the azure\nof her nails, the azure (so she had been told) of Earth seen from\ninterplanetary space, grew hot. She closed them, and for a moment\ngave herself up to an almost physical yearning for the Toluca Lake\nhouse--the comfort, the safety, the--the _sanity_ of it.\n\n\n\nStubbornly she forced herself back to reality. At any moment Jack,\ndark-eyed and scrappy, might come swinging down the long, shining\naisle. Jack--Captain Jack McHenry, if you please--must not know, yet,\nwhat she was doing to patch up their marriage.\n\nShe turned her face away from the aisle, covered her cheek with her\nhand to hide it. Her gaze went out through the ray-proof glass port to\nthe field, to the laboring beetle of a red tractor bearing the gangway\non its busy back, to the low, blast-proof administration building. When\nher gaze came to the tall sign over the entrance, she hurried it past;\nit was too late to think about that now, the square, shouting type that\nread:\n\n                                CAUTION\n\n              HAVE YOU PASSED YOUR PHYSICAL EXAMINATION?\n\n                   _Avoiding It May Cost Your Life!_\n\n\"May I see your validation, please?\"\n\nMarcia McHenry stiffened. Had she read the sign aloud? She turned\nstartled eyes up to the smiling stewardess, who was holding out a\nwell-groomed hand. Marcia responded weakly to the smile, overcame a\nsudden urge to blurt out that she had no validation--not her own,\nanyway. But her stiff fingers were already holding out the pink card\nwith Nellie Foster's name on it.\n\n\"You're feeling well, Mrs. Foster?\"\n\n_Feeling well? Yes, of course. Except for the--usual sickness. But\nthat's so very normal_.... Her numb lips moved. \"I'm fine,\" she said.\n\nMiss Eagen (which, her neat lapel button attested, was her name) made\na penciled frown as lovely as her machined smile. \"Some day,\" she told\nMarcia, \"we won't have to ask the passengers if they're well. It's so\neasy to come aboard on someone else's validation, and people don't seem\nto realize how dangerous that is.\"\n\nAs Miss Eagen moved to the next seat, Marcia shrank into a small\nhuddle, fumbling with the card until it was crammed shapeless into her\npurse. Then from the depths of her guilt came rebellion. It was going\nto be all right. She was doing the biggest thing she'd ever done, and\nJack would rise to the occasion, and it would be all right.\n\nIt _had_ to be all right....\n\nAfter this--if this didn't work--there just would be nothing else she\ncould do. She wasn't a scheming woman. No one would ever know how\ndifficult it had been for her to think up the whole plan, to find\nNellie Foster (someone Jack had never met) and to persuade Nellie to\nregister for the trip and take the physical for her. She'd had to lie\nto Nellie, to make Nellie think she was brave and adventurous, and that\nshe was just doing it to surprise Jack.\n\nOh, he'd be surprised, all right.\n\nThe flash walls on the field were being raised to keep the blow-by from\nthe ship's jets from searing the administration building and the area\nbeyond. Marcia realized with crushing suddenness that the ship was\nabout to blast off in seconds. She half-rose, then sank back, biting\nher lip. Silly ... Jack had said that--her fear of space was silly.\nHe'd said it during the quarrel, and he'd roared at her, \"And that's\nwhy you want me to come back--ground myself, be an Earth-lubber--so I\ncan spare you the anguish of sitting home wondering if I'll come back\nalive!\"\n\n\n\nAnd then he'd been sorry he'd shouted, and he sat by her, taking her\nchin in his hand. \"Marcia, Marcia,\" he'd said gently, \"you're so\n_silly_! It's been nineteen whole years since your father died in the\nexplosion of a Moon-rocket. Rocket motors just don't explode any more,\nhoney! Ships travel to the Moon and back on iron-clad, mathematical\norbits that are figured before the ship puffs a jet--\"\n\n\"The _Elsinore_?\" She'd said it viciously, to taunt him, and something\nin her had been pleased at the dull flush that rose to his face.\nEveryone knew about the _Elsinore_, the 500-foot Moon-ferry that almost\nmissed the Moon.\n\n\"That,\" he said bitterly, \"was human damnfoolishness botching up the\nequations. Too many lobbyists have holdings on the Moon and don't\nwant to risk not being able to go there in a hurry. So they haven't\npassed legislation to keep physically unfit people off spaceships.\nOne of the passengers got aboard the _Elsinore_ on somebody else's\nvalidation--which meant that nobody knew he was taking endocrine\ntreatments to put hair on his brainless head and restore his--Oh, the\n_Jaywalker_!\" Jack spat in disgust. \"Anyway, he was the kind of idiot\nwho never realizes that certain glandular conditions are fatal in free\nfall.\"\n\nEven now she distinctly recalled the beginnings of the interplanetary\ncold that always seeped into the warm house when he talked about space,\nwhen he was about to leave her for it. And this time it was worse than\never before.\n\nHe went on remorselessly, \"Once the _Elsinore_ reached the free-fall\nflight, where power could be shut off, the skipper had to put the\nferry into an axial spin under power, creating artificial gravity\nto save the worthless life of that fool. So of course he lost his\ntrajectory, and had to warp her in as best he could, without passing\nthe Moon or crashing into it. And of course you're not listening.\"\n\n\"It's all so dull!\" she had flared, and then, \"How can I be interested\nin what some blundering space-jockey did?\"\n\n\"Blun--Marcia, you really don't realize what that skipper did was the\nfinest piece of shiphandling since mankind got off the ground.\"\n\n\"Was it?\" she'd yawned. \"Could you do it?\"\n\n\"I--like to think I could,\" he said. \"I'd hate to have to try.\"\n\nShe'd shrugged. \"Then it can't be very difficult, darling.\"\n\nShe hadn't meant to be so cruel. Or so stupid. But when they were\nquarreling, or when he talked that repugnant, dedicated, other-world\ngarble, something always went cold and furious and--lonely inside her,\nand made her fight back unfairly.\n\nAfter he'd gone--for good, he said--her anger had sustained her for a\nfew weeks. Then, bleakly, she knew she'd go to the ends of Earth for\nJack. Or even to the Moon....\n\n\n\nSitting rigid in the tense stillness of a rocket ship that was about\nto leap from Earth, Marcia started as an officer ducked his head into\nthe passenger compartment from the pilot room's deep glow. But it\nwasn't Jack. The officer's lips moved hurriedly as he counted over the\nseats. He ducked back out of sight. From the bulk-heads, the overhead,\neverywhere, came a deep, quiet rumble. Some of the passengers looked\nanxious, some excited, and some just leafed casually through magazines.\n\nNow the brown-clad Miss Eagen was speaking from the head of the aisle.\n\n\"Those of you who haven't been in a rocket before won't find it much\ndifferent from being in an airplane. At the same time--\" She paused,\nquiet brown eyes solemn. \"What you are about to experience is something\nthat will make you proud to belong to the human race.\"\n\n_That_ again! thought Marcia furiously; and then all emotion left her\nbut cold, ravening fear as the rumble heightened. She tried to close\nher eyes, her ears against it, but her mind wouldn't respond. She\nsquirmed in her chair and found herself staring down at the field.\nIt looked the way she felt--flat and pale and devoid of life, with a\nmonstrous structure of terror squatting in it. The scene was abruptly\nsplashed with a rushing sheet of flame that darkened the daytime sky.\nThen it was torn from her vision.\n\nIt was snatched away--the buildings, the trees, the roads surrounding\nthe field seemed to pour in upon it, shrinking as they ran together.\nRoads dried up like parched rivers, thinning and vanishing into the\ncircle of her horrified vision. A great, soft, uniform weight pressed\nher down and back; she fought it, but it was too big and too soft.\n\nNow Earth's surface was vague and Sun-splashed. Marcia's sense of loss\ntore at her. She put up her hands, heavily, and pressed the glass as\nif she could push it out, push herself out, go back, back to Earth\nand solidity. Clouds shot by like bullets, fell away until they were\nsnowflakes roiling in violet haze. Then, in the purling universe that\nhad grown around the ship, Earth was a mystic circle, a shallow dish\nfloating darkly and heavily below.\n\n\"We are now,\" said Miss Eagen's calm voice, \"thirty-seven miles over\nLos Angeles.\"\n\nAfter that, there was scarcely room for thought--even for fear, though\nit lurked nearby, ready to leap. There was the ascent, the quiet,\nsleeplike ascent into space. Marcia very nearly forgot to breathe. She\nhad been prepared for almost anything except this quality of peace and\nawe.\n\n\n\nShe didn't know how long she had been sitting there, awestruck,\nspellbound, when she realized that she had to finish the job she'd\nstarted, and do it right now, this minute. It might already be too\nlate ... she wished, suddenly, and for the very first time, that she'd\npaid more attention to Jack's ramblings about orbits and turn-over\npoints and correction blasts, and all that gobbledegook. She glanced\noutside again and the sky was no longer deep blue, but black. She\npressed herself up out of the soft chair--it was difficult, because of\nthe one-and-a-half gravities the ship was holding--and plodded heavily\nup the aisle. Miss Eagen was just rising from the chair in which she\nsat for the take-off.\n\n\"Miss Eagen--\"\n\n\"Yes, Mrs. Fos--why, what's the matter?\"\n\nSeeing the startled expression on the stewardess' face, Marcia realized\nshe must be looking like a ghost. She put a hand to her cheek and found\nit clammy.\n\n\"Come along,\" said Miss Eagen cheerfully. She put a firm arm around\nMarcia's shoulder. \"Just a touch of space-sickness. This way. _That's_\nit. We'll have you fixed up in a jiffy.\"\n\n\"It isn't s-space sickness,\" said Marcia in a very small and very\npositive voice. She let herself be led forward, through the door and to\nthe left, where there was a small and compact ship's hospital.\n\n\"Now, now,\" said Miss Eagen briskly, \"just you lie down there, Mrs.\nFoster. Does it hurt any special place?\"\n\nMarcia lay down gratefully. She closed her eyes tightly and said, \"I'm\nnot Mrs. Foster. It doesn't hurt.\"\n\n\"You're not--\" Miss Eagen apparently decided to take one thing at a\ntime. \"How do you feel?\"\n\n\"Scared,\" said Marcia.\n\n\"Why, what--is there to be scared of?\"\n\n\"I'm pregnant.\"\n\n\"Well, that's no--You're _what_?\"\n\n\"I'm Mrs. McHenry. I'm Jack's wife.\"\n\nThere was such a long pause that Marcia opened her eyes. Miss Eagen was\nlooking at her levelly. She said, \"I'll have to examine you.\"\n\n\"I know. Go ahead.\"\n\nMiss Eagen did, swiftly and thoroughly. \"You're so right,\" she\nbreathed. She went to the small sink, stripping off her rubber gloves.\nWith her back to Marcia, she said, \"I'll have to tell the captain, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"I know. I'd rather ... tell him myself.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Miss Eagen flatly. Marcia felt as if she'd been slapped.\nMiss Eagen dried her hands and crossed to an intercom. \"Eagen to\nCaptain.\"\n\n\"McHenry here.\"\n\n\"Captain McHenry, could you come back to the hospital right away?\"\n\n\"Not right away, Sue.\" _Sue! No wonder he had found it so easy to walk\nout!_ She looked at the trim girl with hating eyes. The intercom said,\n\"You know I've got course-correction computations from here to yonder.\nGive me another forty minutes.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Sue Eagen into the mike, \"that the computations can\nwait.\"\n\n\"The hell you do!\" The red contact light on the intercom went out.\n\n\"He'll be right here,\" said Miss Eagen.\n\n\n\nMarcia sat up slowly, clumsily. Miss Eagen did not offer to help.\nMarcia's hands strayed to her hair, patted it futilely.\n\nHe came in, moving fast and purposefully, as always. \"Sue, what in time\ndo you think you--_Marcia!_\" His dark face broke into a delighted grin\nand he put his arms out. \"You--you're here--_here_, on my ship!\"\n\n\"I'm pregnant, Jack,\" she said. She put out a hand to ward him off. She\ncouldn't bear the thought of his realizing what she had done while he\nhad his arms around her.\n\n\"You _are_? You--we--\" He turned to Miss Eagen, who nodded once, her\nface wooden. \"Just find it out?\"\n\nThis time Miss Eagen didn't react at all, and Marcia knew that she had\nto speak up. \"No, Jack. I knew weeks ago.\"\n\nThere was no describable change in his face, but the taut skin of his\nspace-tanned cheek seemed, somehow, to draw inward. His eyebrow ridges\nseemed to be more prominent, and he looked older, and very tired.\nSoftly and slowly he asked, \"What in God's name made you get on the\nship?\"\n\n\"I had to, Jack. I had to.\"\n\n\"Had to kill yourself?\" he demanded brutally. \"This tears it. This ties\nit up in a box with a bloody ribbon-bow. I suppose you know what this\nmeans--what I've got to do now?\"\n\n\"Spin ship,\" she replied immediately, and looked up at him pertly, like\na kindergarten child who knows she has the right answer.\n\nHe groaned.\n\n\"You said you could do it.\"\n\n\"I can ... try,\" he said hollowly. \"But--why, _why_?\"\n\n\"Because,\" she said bleakly, \"I learned long ago that a man grows to\nlove what he has to fight for.\"\n\n\"And you were going to make me fight for you and the child--even if the\nlives of a hundred and seventy people were involved?\"\n\n\"You said you could handle it. I thought you could.\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" he said wearily. \"Oh, I'll try.\" He went out, dragging his\nfeet, his shoulders down, without looking at her.\n\nThere was a stiff silence. Marcia looked up at Miss Eagen. \"It's true,\nyou know,\" she said. \"A man grows to love the things he has to defend,\nno matter how he felt about them before.\"\n\nThe stewardess looked at her, her face registering a strange mixture of\ndetachment and wonder. \"You really believe that, don't you?\"\n\nMarcia's patience, snapped. \"You don't have to look so superior. I know\nwhat's bothering _you_. Well, he's _my_ husband, and don't you forget\nit.\"\n\n\n\nMiss Eagen's breath hissed in. Her eyes grew bright and she shook her\nhead slightly. Then she turned on her heel and went to the intercom.\nMarcia thought for a frightened moment that she was going to call Jack\nback again. Instead she dialed and said, \"Hospital to Maintenance.\nPetrucelli?\"\n\n\"Petrucelli here.\"\n\n\"Come up with a crescent wrench, will you, Pet?\"\n\nAnother stiff silence. A question curled into Marcia's mind and she\nasked it. \"Do you work on all these ships at one time or another?\"\n\nMiss Eagen did not beat around the bush. \"I've been with Captain\nMcHenry for three years. I hope to work with him always. I think he's\nthe finest in the Service.\"\n\n\"He--th-thinks as well of you, no doubt.\"\n\nPetrucelli lounged in, a big man, easy-going, powerful. \"What's busted,\nmuscles?\"\n\n\"Bolt the bed to the bulkhead, Pet. Mrs. McHenry--I'm sorry, but you'll\nhave to get up.\"\n\nMarcia bounced resentfully off the cot and stood aside. Petrucelli\nlooked at her, cocked an eyebrow, looked at Miss Eagen, and asked,\n\"Jaywalker?\"\n\n\"Please hurry, Pet.\" She turned to Marcia. \"I've got to explain to the\npassengers that there won't be any free fall. Most of them are looking\nforward to it.\" She went out.\n\nMarcia watched the big man work for a moment. \"Why are you putting the\nbed on the wall?\"\n\nHe looked at her and away, quickly. \"Because, lady, when we start to\nspin, that outside bulkhead is going to be _down_. Centrifugal force,\nsee?\" And before she could answer him he added, \"I can't talk and work\nat the same time.\"\n\nFeeling very much put-upon, Marcia waited silently until he was\nfinished, and the bed hung ludicrously to the wall like a walking fly.\nShe thanked him timidly, and he ignored it and went out.\n\nMiss Eagen returned.\n\n\"That man was very rude,\" said Marcia.\n\nMiss Eagen looked at her coolly. \"I'm sorry,\" she said, obviously not\nmeaning sorry at all.\n\nMarcia wet her lips. \"I asked you a question before,\" she said evenly.\n\"About you and the captain.\"\n\n\"You did,\" said Sue Eagen. \"Please don't.\"\n\n\"And why not?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Miss Eagen, and in that moment she looked almost as\ndrawn as Jack had, \"I'm supposed to be of service to the passengers at\nall times no matter what. If I have feelings at all, part of my job is\nto keep them to myself.\"\n\n\"Very courteous, I'm sure. However, I want to release you from your\nsense of duty. I'm _most_ interested in what you have to say.\"\n\nMiss Eagen's arched nostrils seemed pinched and white. \"You really want\nme to speak my piece?\"\n\n\n\nIn answer Marcia leaned back against the bulkhead and folded her arms.\nMiss Eagen gazed at her for a moment, nodded as if to herself, and\nsaid, \"I suppose there always will be people who don't pay attention\nto the rules. Jaywalkers. But out here jaywalkers don't have as much\nmargin for error as they do crossing against a traffic light on Earth.\"\nShe looked Marcia straight in the eye. \"What makes a jaywalker isn't\nignorance. It's a combination of stupidity and stubbornness. The\njaywalker does _know_ better. In your case....\"\n\nShe sighed. \"It's well known--even by you--that the free-fall condition\nhas a weird effect on certain people. The human body is in an\nunprecedented situation in free fall. Biologically it has experienced\nthe condition for very short periods--falling out of trees, or on\ndelayed parachute jumps. But it isn't constituted to take hour after\nhour of fall.\"\n\n\"What about floating in a pool for hours?\" asked Marcia sullenly.\n\n\"That's quite a different situation. 'Down' exists when you're\nswimming. Free-fall means that everything around you is 'up.' The\nbody's reactions to free-fall go much deeper than space-nausea and a\nmild feeling of panic. When there's a glandular imbalance of certain\nkinds, the results can be drastic. Apparently some instinctual part\nof the mind reacts as if there were a violent emergency, when no\nemergency is recognized by the reasoning part of the mind. There\nare sudden floods of adrenalin; the 17-kesteroids begin spastic\nsecretions; the--well, it varies in individuals. But it's pretty well\nestablished that the results can be fatal. It kills men with prostate\ntrouble--sometimes. It kills women in menopause--often. It kills women\nin the early stages of pregnancy--_always_.\"\n\n\"But how?\" asked Marcia, interested in spite of her resentment.\n\n\"Convulsions. A battle royal between a glandular-level panic and a\nviolent and useless effort of the will to control the situation.\nMuscles tear, working against one another. Lungs rupture and air\nis forced into the blood-stream, causing embolism and death. Not\neverything is known about it, but I would guess that pregnant women are\nespecially susceptible because their protective reflexes, through and\nthrough, are much more easily stimulated.\"\n\n\"And the only thing that can be done about it is to supply gravity?\"\n\n\"Or centrifugal force (or centripetal, depending on where you're\nstanding, but why be technical?)--or, better yet, keep those people\noff the ships.\"\n\n\"So now Jack will spin the ship until I'm pressed against the walls\nwith the same force as gravity, and then everything will be all right.\"\n\n\"You make it sound so simple.\"\n\n\"There's no need to be sarcastic!\" Marcia blurted. \"Jack can do it. You\nthink he can, don't you? Don't you?\"\n\n\"He can do anything any space skipper has ever done, and more,\"\nsaid Sue Eagen, and her face glowed. \"But it isn't easy. Right this\nminute he's working over the computer--a small, simple, ship-board\ncomputer--working out orbital and positional and blast-intensity data\nthat would be a hard nut for the giant calculators on Earth to crack.\nAnd he's doing it in half the time--or less--than it would take the\naverage mathematician, because he has to; because it's a life-and-death\nmatter if he makes a mistake or takes too long.\"\n\n\n\n\"But--but--\"\n\n\"But what?\" Miss Eagen's composure seemed to have been blasted to\nshreds by the powerful currents of her indignation. Her eyes flashed.\n\"You mean, but why doesn't he just work the ship while it's spinning\nthe same way he does when it isn't?\"\n\nThrough a growing fear, Marcia nodded mutely.\n\n\"He'll spin the ship on its long axis,\" said the stewardess with\nexaggerated patience. \"That means that the steering jet tubes in the\nnose and tail are spinning, too. You don't just turn with a blast on\none tube or another. The blasts have to be let off in hundreds of short\nbursts, timed to the hundredth of a second, to be able to make even a\nslight course correction. The sighting instruments are wheeling round\nand round while you're checking your position. Your fuel has to be\ncalculated to the last ounce--because enough fuel for a Moon flight,\nwith hours of fuelless free-fall, and enough fuel for a power spin\nand course corrections while spinning, are two very different things.\nCaptain McHenry won't be able to maneuver to a landing on the Moon.\nHe'll do it exactly right the first time, or not at all.\"\n\nMarcia was white and still. \"I--I never--\"\n\n\"But I haven't told you the toughest part of it yet,\" Miss Eagen went\non inexorably. \"A ship as massive as this, spinning on its long axis,\nis a pretty fair gyroscope. It doesn't want to turn. Any force that\ntries to make it turn is resisted at right angles to the force applied.\nWhen that force is applied momentarily from jets, as they swing into\nposition and away again, the firing formulas get--well, complex. And\nthe ship's course and landing approach are completely new. Instead\nof letting the ship fall to the Moon, turning over and approaching\ntail-first with the main jets as brakes, Captain McHenry is going to\nhave to start the spin first and go almost the whole way nose-first.\nHe'll come up on the Moon obliquely, pass it, stop the spin, turn over\nonce to check the speed of the ship, and once again to put the tail\ndown when the Moon's gravity begins to draw us in. There'll be two\nshort periods of free-fall there, but they won't be long enough to\nbother you much. And if we can do all that with the fuel we've got, it\nwill be a miracle. A miracle from the brain of Captain McHenry.\"\n\nMarcia forced herself away from the bulkhead with a small whimper of\nhurt and hatred--hatred of the stars, of this knowledgeable, inspired\ngirl, and--even more so--of herself. She darted toward the door.\n\nMiss Eagen was beside her in an instant, a hard small hand on her arm.\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"I'm going to stop him. He can't take that chance with his ship, with\nthese people....\"\n\n\"He will and he must. You surely know your husband.\"\n\n\"I know him as well as you do.\"\n\n\n\nMiss Eagen's firm lips shut in a thin hard line. \"Do as you like,\" she\nwhispered. \"And while you're doing it--think about whom he's spinning\nship for.\" She took her hand from Marcia's arm.\n\nMarcia twisted away and went into the corridor.\n\nShe found herself at the entrance to the pilot room. In one sweeping\nglance she saw a curved, silver board. Before it a man sat tranquilly.\nNearer to her was Jack, hunched over the keyboard of a complex, compact\nmachine, like a harried bookkeeper on the last day of the month.\n\nHer lips formed his name, but she was silent. She watched him, his\nsquare, competent hands, his detached and distant face. Through the\nforward view-plate she saw a harsh, jagged line, the very edge of the\nMoon's disc. Next to it, and below, was the rear viewer, holding the\nshimmering azure shape of Earth.\n\n\"_All Earth watches me when I work, but with your eyes._\"\n\nJack had said that to her once, long ago, when he still loved her.\n\n\"... human damnfoolishness botching up the equations....\" He had said\nthat once, too.\n\nMiss Eagen was standing by the hospital door, watching her. When Marcia\nturned away without speaking to Jack, Miss Eagen smiled and held out\nher hand.\n\nMarcia went to her and took the hand. They went into the hospital. Miss\nEagen didn't speak; she seemed to be waiting.\n\n\"Yes, I know who Jack's spinning the ship for,\" said Marcia.\n\nMiss Eagen looked an unspoken question.\n\nMarcia said, painfully, \"He's like the Captain of the _Elsinore_. He's\nrisking his life for a--a stranger. A jaywalker. Not for me. Not even\nfor his baby.\"\n\n\"Does it hurt to know that?\"\n\nMarcia looked into the smooth, strong face and said with genuine\nastonishment, \"Hurt? Oh, no! It's so--so big!\"\n\nThere was a sudden thunder. Over Miss Eagen's shoulder, through the\nport, Marcia saw the stars begin to move. Miss Eagen followed her gaze.\n\"He's started the spin. You'll be all right now.\"\n\n\n\nMarcia could never recall the rest of the details of the trip. There\nwas the outboard bulkhead that drew her like a magnet, increasingly,\nuntil suddenly it wasn't an attracting wall, but normally and naturally\n\"down.\" Then a needle, and another one, and a long period of deep\ndrowsiness and unreality.\n\nBut through and through that drugged, relaxed period, Jack and the\nstars, the Moon and Sue Eagen danced and wove. Words slipped in and out\nof it like shreds of melody:\n\n\"A man comes to love the things he has to fight for.\" And Jack\nfighting--for his ship, for the Moon, for the new-building traditions\nof the great ones who would carry humanity out to the stars.\n\nSue Eagen was there, too, and the thing she shared with Jack. Of course\nthere was something between them--so big a thing that there was\nnothing for her to fear in it.\n\nJack and Sue Eagen had always had it, and always would have; and now\nMarcia had it too. And with understanding replacing fear, Marcia was\nfree to recall that Jack had worked with Sue Eagen--but it was Marcia\nthat he had loved and married.\n\n\n\nThere was a long time of blackness, and then a time of agony, when\nshe was falling, falling, and her lungs wanted to split, explode,\ndisintegrate, and someone kept saying, \"Hold tight, Marcia; hold tight\nto me,\" and she found Sue Eagen's cool strong hands in hers.\n\n_Marcia. She called me Marcia._\n\nMore blackness, more pain--but not so much this time; and then a long,\ndeep sleep.\n\nA curved ceiling, but a new curve, and soft rose instead of the\ngunmetal-and-chrome of the ship. White sheets, a new feeling of \"down\"\nthat was unlike either Earth or the ship, a novel and exhilarating\nbuoyancy. And kneeling by the bed--\n\n\"Jack!\"\n\n\"You're all right, honey.\"\n\nShe raised herself on her elbow and looked out through the unglazed\nwindow at the ordered streets of the great Luna Dome. \"The Moon....\nJack, you did it!\"\n\nHe snapped his fingers. He looked like a high-school kid. \"Nothin' to\nit.\" She could see he was very proud. Very tired, too. He reached out\nto touch her.\n\nShe drew back. \"You don't have to be sweet to me,\" she said quietly. \"I\nunderstand how you must feel.\"\n\n\"Don't _have_ to?\" He rose, bent over her, and slid his arms around\nher. He put his face into the shadowed warmth between her hair and her\nneck and said, \"Listen, egghead, there's no absolute scale for courage.\nWe had a bad time, both of us. After it was over, and I had a chance\nto think, I used it trying to look at things through your eyes. And\nthat way I found out that when you walked up that gangway, you did the\nbravest thing I've ever known anyone to do. And you did it for me. It\ndoesn't matter what else happened.
