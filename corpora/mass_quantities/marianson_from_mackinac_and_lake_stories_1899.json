  "body": "When the British landed on the west side of Mackinac Island at three\no'clock in the morning of July 17,1812, Canadians were ordered to\ntransport the cannon. They had only a pair of six-pounders, but these\nhad to be dragged across the long alluvial stretch to heights which\nwould command the fortress, and sand, rock, bushes, trees, and fallen\nlogs made it a dreadful portage. Voyageurs, however, were men to\naccomplish what regulars and Indians shirked.\n\nAll but one of the hundred and sixty Canadians hauled with a good\nwill on the cannon ropes. The dawn was glimmering. Paradise hid in the\nuntamed island, breathing dew and spice. The spell worked instantly upon\nthat one young voyageur whose mind was set against the secret\nattack. All night his rage had been swelling. He despised the British\nregulars-forty-two lords of them only being in this expedition-as they\nin turn despised his class. They were his conquerors. He had no desire\nto be used as means of pushing their conquest further. These islanders\nhe knew to be of his own race, perhaps crossed with Chippewa blood.\n\nSeven hundred Indians, painted and horned for war, skulked along as\nallies in the dim morning twilight. He thought of sleeping children\nroused by tomahawk and scalping-knife in case the surprised fort did not\nimmediately surrender. Even then, how were a few hundred white men to\nrestrain nearly a thousand savages?\n\nThe young Canadian, as a rush was made with the ropes, stumbled over a\nlog and dropped behind a bush. His nearest companions scarcely noticed\nthe desertion in their strain, but the officer instantly detailed an\nIndian.\n\n“One of you Sioux bring that fellow back or bring his scalp.”\n\nA Sioux stretched forward and leaped eagerly into the woods. All the\nboy's years of wilderness training were concentrated on an escape. The\nEnglish officer meant to make him a lesson to the other voyageurs. And\nhe smiled as he thought of the race he could give the Sioux. All his\narms except his knife were left behind the bush; for fleet-ness was to\ncount in this venture. The game of life or death was a pretty one, to\nbe enjoyed as he shot from tree to tree, or like a noiseless-hoofed deer\nmade a long stretch of covert. He was alive through every blood drop.\nThe dewy glory of dawn had never seemed so great. Cool as the Sioux\nwhom he dodged, his woodsman's eye gathered all aspects of the strange\nforest. A detached rock, tall as a tree, raised its colossal altar,\nsurprising the eye like a single remaining temple pillar.\n\nOld logs, scaled as in a coat of mail, testified to the humidity of this\nlush place. The boy trod on sweet white violets smelling of incense.\n\nThe wooded deeps unfolded in thinning dusk and revealed a line of high\nverdant cliffs walling his course. He dashed through hollows where\nmillions of ferns bathed him to the knees. As daylight grew--though it\nnever was quite daylight there-so did his danger. He expected to hear\nthe humming of an arrow, and perhaps to feel a shock and sting and\ncleaving of the bolt, and turned in recklessly to climb for the uplands,\nwhere after miles of jutting spurs the ridge stooped and pushed out in\nfront of itself a round-topped rock. As the Canadian passed this rock a\nyellow flare like candle-light came through a crack at its base.\n\nHe dropped on all-fours. The Indian was not in sight. He squirmed within\na low battlement of serrated stone guarding the crack, and let himself\ndown into what appeared to be the mouth of a cave. The opening was so\nlow as to be invisible just outside the serrated breastwork. He found\nhimself in a room of rock, irregularly hollow above, with a candle\nburning on the stone floor. As he sat upright and stretched forth a hand\nto pinch off the flame, the image of a sleeping woman was printed on his\neyeballs so that he saw every careless ring of fair hair around her head\nand every curve of her body for hours afterwards in the dusk.\n\nHis first thought was to place himself where his person would intercept\nany attack at the mouth of the cave. Knife in hand, he waited for a\nhorned, glittering-eyed face to stoop or an arrow or hatchet to glance\nunder that low rim, the horizon of his darkness. His chagrin at having\ntaken to a trap and drawn danger on a woman was poignant; the candle\nhad caught him like a moth, and a Sioux would keenly follow. Still, no\nlightest step betrayed the Sioux's knowledge of his whereabouts. A\nlong time passed before he relaxed to an easy posture and turned to the\ninterior of the cave.\n\nThe drip of a veiled water-vein at the rear made him conscious of\nthirst, but the sleeping woman was in the way of his creeping to take\na drink. Wrapped in a fur robe, she lay breathing like an infant,\nwhite-skinned, full-throated, and vigorous, a woman older than himself.\n\nThe consequences of her waking did not threaten him as perilous. Without\nreasoning, he was convinced that a woman who lay down to sleep beside\na burning candle in this wild place would make no outcry when she\nawoke and found the light had drawn instead of kept away possible\ncave-inhabitants. Day grew beyond the low sill and thinned obscurity\naround him, showing the swerve of the roof to a sloping shelf.\nPerspiration cooled upon him and he shivered. A fire and a breakfast\nwould have been good things, which he had often enjoyed in danger.\nRowing all night, and landing cannon at the end of it, and running a\nleague or more for life, exhausted a man.\n\nThe woman stirred, and the young voyageur thought of dropping his knife\nback into its sheath. At the slight click she sat up, drawing in her\nbreath.\n\nHe whispered: “Do not be afraid. I have not come in here to hurt you.”\n\nShe was staring at him, probably taking him for some monster of the\ndark.\n\n“Have you anything here to eat?”\n\nThe woman resumed her suspended breath, and answered in the same guarded\nway, and in French like his: “Yes. I come to this part of the island so\nof ten that I have put bread and meat and candles in the cave. How did\nyou find it? No one but myself knew about it.”\n\n“I saw the candle-light.”\n\n“The candle was to keep off evil spirits. It has been blown out. Where\ndid you come from?”\n\n“From St. Joseph Island last night with the English. They have taken the\nisland by surprise.”\n\nShe unexpectedly laughed in a repressed gurgle, as a faun or other woods\ncreature might have laughed at the predicaments of men.\n\n“I am thinking of the stupid American soldiers--to lie asleep and let\nthe British creep in upon them. But have you seen my cow? I searched\neverywhere, until the moon went down and I was tired to death, for my\ncow.”\n\n“No, I saw no cow. I had the Sioux to watch.”\n\n“What Sioux?”\n\n“The Indian our commandant sent after me. Speak low. He may be listening\noutside.”\n\nThey themselves listened.\n\n“If Indians have come on the island they will kill all the cattle.”\n\n“There are the women and children and men--even poor voyageurs--for them\nto kill first.”\n\nShe gasped, “Is it war?”\n\n“Yes, it is war.”\n\n“I never have seen war. Why did you come here?”\n\n“I did not want to, mademoiselle, and I deserted. That is why the Indian\nwas sent after me.”\n\n“Do not call me mademoiselle. I am Marianson Bruelle, the widow of André\nChenier. Our houses will be burned, and our gardens trampled, and our\nboats stolen.”\n\n“Not if the fort surrenders.”\n\nAgain they harkened to the outside world in suspense. The deserter had\nexpected to hear cannon before sunlight so slowly crept under the cave's\nlip. It was as if they sat within a colossal skull, broad between the\nears but narrowing towards the top, with light coming through the parted\nmouth. Accustomed to the soft twilight, the two could see each other,\nand the woman covertly put her dress in order while she talked.\n\nMore than fearlessness, even a kind of maternal passion, moved her. She\nsearched in the back of the cave and handed her strange guest food, and\ngathered him a birch cup of water from the dripping rock. The touch of\nhis fingers sent a new vital thrill through her. Two may talk together\nunder the same roof for many years, yet never really meet; and two\nothers at first speech are old friends. She did not know this young\nvoyageur, yet she began to claim him.\n\nHe was so tired that the tan of his cheek turned leaden in the cave\ngloom. She rose from her bearskin and spread it for him, when he\nfinished eating.\n\n“You cannot go out now,” he whispered, when he saw her intention. “The\nSioux is somewhere in the woods watching for me. The Indians came on\nthis island for scalps. You will not be safe, even in the fort, until\nthe fight is over, or until night comes again.”\n\nMarianson, standing convinced by what he said, was unable to take her\neyes off him. Mass seemed always irksome to her in spite of the frequent\nchanges of posture and her conviction that it was good for her soul. She\nwas at her happiest plunging through woods or panting up cliffs which\nsquaws dared not scale. Yet enforced hiding with a stranger all day in\nthe cave was assented to by this active sylvan creature. She had not\na word to say against it, and the danger of going out was her last\nthought. The cavern's mouth was a very awkward opening to crawl through,\nespecially if an Indian should catch one in the act. There was nothing\nto do but to sit down and wait.\n\nA sigh of pleasure, as at inhaling the spirit of a flower, escaped her\nlips. This lad, whose presence she knew she would feel without seeing\nif he came into church behind her, innocent of the spell he was casting,\nstill sat guarding the entrance, though the droop of utter weariness\nrelaxed every posture. Marianson bade him lie down on the fur robe, and\nimperiously arranged her lap to hold his head.\n\n“I am maman to you. I say to you sleep, and you shall sleep.”\n\nThe appealing and thankful eyes of the boy were closed almost as soon\nas he crept upon the robe and his head sunk in its comfortable pillow.\nMarianson braced her back against the wall and dropped her hands at her\nsides. Occasionally she glanced at the low rim of light. No Indian could\nenter without lying flat. She had little dread of the Sioux.\n\nEvery globule which fell in darkness from the rock recorded, like the\nsand grain of an hour-glass, some change in Marianson.\n\n“I not care for anybody, me,” had been her boast when she tantalized\nsoldiers on the village street. Her gurgle of laughter, and the hair\nblowing on her temples from under the blanket she drew around her face,\nworked havoc in Mackinac. To her men were merely useful objects, like\ncows, or houses, or gardens, or boats. She hugged the social liberty of\na woman who had safely passed through matrimony and widowhood. Married\nto old André Chenier by her parents, that he might guard her after their\ndeath, she loathed the thought of another wearisome tie, and called it\nveneration of his departed spirit. He left her a house, a cow, and a\nboat. Accustomed to work for him, she found it much easier to work for\nherself when he was gone, and resented having young men hang around\ndesiring to settle in her house. She laughed at every proposal a father\nor mother made her. No family on the island could get her, and all\nunited in pointing her out as a bad pattern for young women.\n\nA bloom like the rose flushing of early maidenhood came over Marianson\nwith her freedom. Isolated and daring and passionless, she had no\nconception of the scandal she caused in the minds of those who carried\nthe burdens of the community, but lived like a bird of the air. Wives\nwho bore children and kept the pot boiling found it hard to see her\ntiptoeing over cares which swallowed them. She did not realize that\nmaids desired to marry and she took their lovers from them.\n\nBut knowledge grew in her as she sat holding the stranger's head in\nher lap, though it was not a day on which to trouble one's self with\nknowledge. There was only the forest's voice outside, that ceaseless\nmajestic hymn of the trees, accompanied by the shore ripple, which was\nsuch a little way off. Languors like the sweet languors of spring came\nover her. She was happier than she had ever been before in her life.\n\n“It is delicious,” she thought. “I have been in the cave many times, but\nit will never be like this again.”\n\nAnd it was a strange joy to find the touch of a human being something\nto delight in. There was sweet wickedness in it; penance might have to\nfollow. What would the curé say if he saw her? To amuse one's self with\nsoldiers and islanders was one thing; to sit tranced all day in a cave\nwith a stranger must be another.\n\nThere was a rough innocence in his relaxed body--beautiful as the virgin\nsoftness of a girl. Under the spell of his unconscious domination, she\ndid not care about his past. Her own past was nothing. She had arrived\nin the present. Time stood still. His face was turned towards her, and\nshe studied all its curves, yet knew if he had other features he would\nstill be the one person in the world who could so draw her. What was the\npower? Had women elsewhere felt it? At that thought she had a pang of\nanguish and rage altogether new to her. Marianson was tender even in her\namusements; her benevolence extended to dumb cattle; but in the hidden\ndarkness of her consciousness she found herself choosing the Sioux for\nhim, rather than a woman.\n\nOnce he half raised his head, but again let it sink to its rest.\nMarianson grew faint; and as the light waned at the cave mouth she\nremembered she had not eaten anything that day. The fast made her seem\nfit to say prayers, and she said all she knew over his head, like a\nmother brooding.\n\nHe startled her by sitting up, without warning, fully roused and alert.\n\n“What time is it?” inquired the boy.\n\n“Look at the door. The sun has long been behind the trees.”\n\n“Have I slept all day?”\n\n“Perhaps.”\n\n“And have you heard no sound of battle?”\n\n“It has been still as the village street during mass.”\n\n“What, then, have they done, those English? They must have taken the\nfort without firing a gun. And the Sioux-you have not seen him?”\n\n“Nothing has passed the cave door, not even a chipmunk.”\n\nHe stretched his arms upward into the hollow, standing tall and well\nmade, his buckskin shirt turned back from his neck.\n\n“I am again hungry.”\n\n“I also,” said Marianson. “I have not eaten anything to-day.”\n\nHer companion dropped on his knees before her and took out of her hands\nthe food she had ready. His face expressed shame and compunction as he\nfed her himself, offering bites to her mouth with gentle persistence.\nShe laughed the laugh peculiar to herself, and pushed his hand back to\nhis own lips. So they ate together, and afterwards drank from the same\ncup. Marianson showed him where the drops came down, and he gathered\nthem, smiling at her from the depths of the cave. They heard the evening\ncawing of crows, and the waters rushing with a wilder wash on the beach.\n\n“I will bring more bread and meat when I come back,” promised\nMarianson--“unless the English have burned the house.”\n\n“No. When it is dark I will leave the cave myself,” said the voyageur.\n“Is there any boat near by that I can take to escape in from the\nisland?”\n\n“There is my boat. But it is at the post.”\n\n“How far are we from the post?”\n\n“It is not so far if one might cross the island; but to go by the west\nshore, which would be safest, perhaps, in time of war, that is the\ngreater part of the island's girth.”\n\nThey drew near together as they murmured, and at intervals he held the\ncup to her lips, making up for his forgetfulness when benumbed with\nsleep.\n\n“One has but to follow the shore, however,” said the boy. “And where can\nI find the boat?”\n\n“You cannot find it at all.”\n\n“But,” he added, with sudden recollection, “I could never return it\nagain.”\n\nMarianson saw on the cave's rough wall a vision of her boat carrying him\naway. Her own little craft, the sail of which she knew how to trim--her\nbird, her flier, her food-winner--was to become her robber.\n\n“When the war is over,” she ventured, “then you might come back.”\n\nHe began to explain difficulties like an honest lad, and she stopped\nhim. “I do not want to know anything. I want you to take my boat.”\n\nHe put the cup down and seized her hands and kissed them. She crouched\nagainst the cave's side, her eyes closed. If he was only grateful to\nher for bread and shelter and means of escape, it was little enough she\nreceived, but his warm touch and his lips on her palms--for he kissed\nher palms--made her none the less dizzy.\n\n“Listen to me,” said Marianson. “If I give you my boat, you must do\nexactly as I bid you.”\n\n“I promise.”\n\n“You must stay here until I bring it to you. I am going at once.”\n\n“But you cannot go alone in the dark. You are a woman--you will be\nafraid.”\n\n“Never in my life have I been afraid.”\n\n“But there are Indians on the war-path now.”\n\n“They will be in camp or drunk at the post. Your Sioux has left this\npart of the island. He may come back by morning, but he would not camp\naway from so much plunder. Sioux cannot be unlike our Chippewas. Do you\nthink,” demanded Marianson, “that you will be quite, quite safe in the\ncave?”\n\nHer companion laughed.\n\n“If I find the cave unsafe I can leave it; but you in the dark\nalone--you must let me go with you.”\n\n“No; the risk is too great. It is better for me to go alone. I know\nevery rock, every bend of the shore. The pull back around the island\nwill be hardest, if there is not enough wind.”\n\n“I go with you,” decided the boy.\n\n“But you gave me your promise to do exactly as I bade you. I am older\nthan you,” said Marianson.\n\n“I know what is best, and that is that you remain here until I come.\nSwear to me that you will.”\n\nHe was silent, beseeching her with his eyes to relent. Then, owning her\nright to dominate, he pledged her by the name of his saint to do as she\nrequired.\n\nTheir forced companionship, begun at daylight, was ending as darkness\ncrept through the cavern's mouth. They waited, and those last moments of\nsilence, while they leaned to look closely at each other with the night\ngrowing between them, were a benediction on the day.\n\nMarianson stooped to creep through the cavern's mouth, but once more she\nturned and looked at him, and it was she herself who stretched appealing\narms. The boy's shyness and the woman's aversion to men vanished as in\nfire. They stood together in the hollow of the cave in one long embrace.\nHe sought her mouth and kissed her, and, suffocating with joy, she\nescaped through the low door.\n\nIndifferent to the Indian who might be dogging her, she drew her strip\nof home-spun around her face and ran, moccasined and deft-footed, over\nthe stones, warm, palpitating, and laughing, full of physical hardihood.\nIn the woods, on her left, she knew there were rocks splashed with stain\nblack as ink and crusted with old lichens. On her right white-caps were\nrunning before the west wind and diving like ducks on the strait. She\ncrossed the threads of a brook ravelling themselves from density.\nFor the forest was a mask. But Marianson knew well the tricks of that\nbrook--its pellucid shining on pebbles, its cascades, its hidings\nunderground of all but a voice and a crystal pool. Wet to her knees, she\nhad more than once followed it to its source amid such greenery of moss\nand logs as seemed a conflagration of verdure.\n\nThe many points and bays of the island sped behind her, and cliffs\ncrowded her to the water's edge or left her a dim moving object on a\nlonesome beach. Sometimes she heard sounds in the woods and listened; on\nthe other hand, she had the companionship of stars and moving water. On\nthat glorified journey Marianson's natural fearlessness carried her past\nthe Devil's Kitchen and quite near the post before she began to consider\nhow it was best to approach a place which might be in the hands of an\nenemy. Her boat was tied at the dock. She had the half-ruined distillery\nyet to pass. It had stood under the cliff her lifetime. As she drew\nnearer, cracks of light and a hum like the droning of a beehive\nmagically turned the old distillery into a caravansary of spirits.\n\nNothing in her long tramp had startled her like this. It was a relief to\nhear the click of metal and a strange-spoken word, and to find herself\nface to face with an English soldier. He made no parley, but marched\nher before him; and the grateful noise of squalling babies and maternal\nprotests and Maman Pelott's night lullaby also met her as they proceeded\ntowards the distillery.\n\nThe long dark shed had a chimney-stack and its many-coiled still in one\nend. Beside that great bottle-shaped thing, at the base of the chimney,\nwas an open fireplace piled with flaming sticks, and this had made the\nluminous crevices. All Mackinac village was gathered within the walls,\nand Marian-son beheld a camp supping, putting children to bed on\nblankets in corners, sitting and shaking fingers at one another in\nwrathful council, or running about in search of lost articles. The curé\nwas there, keeping a restraint on his people. Clothes hung on spikes\nlike rows of suicides in the weird light. Even fiddlers and jollity\nwere not lacking. A heavier race would have come to blows in that strait\nenclosure, but these French and half-breeds, in danger of scalping if\nthe Indians proved turbulent, dried their eyes after losses, and shook\ntheir legs ready for a dance at the scraping of a violin.\n\nLittle Ignace Pelott was directly pulling at Mari-anson's petticoat to\nget attention.\n\n“De Ingins kill our 'effer,” he lamented, in the mongrel speech of the\nquarter-breed. “Dey didn't need him; dey have plenty to eat. But dey\nkill our 'effer and laugh.”\n\n“My cow, is it also killed, Ignace?”\n\nMarianson's neighbors closed around her, unsurprised at her late\narrival, filled only with the general calamity. Old men's pipe smoke\nmingled with odors of food; and when the English soldier had satisfied\nhimself that she belonged to this caldron of humanity, he lifted the\ncorners of his nose and returned to open air and guard duty.\n\nThe fort had been surrendered without a shot, to save the lives of the\nvillagers, and they were all hurried to the distillery and put under\nguard. They would be obliged to take the oath of allegiance to England,\nor leave the island. Michael Dousman, yet held in the enemy's camp, was\nfiercely accused of bringing the English upon them. No, Marianson could\nnot go to the village, or even to the dock.\n\nEverybody offered her food. A boat she did not ask for. The high\ncobwebby openings of the distillery looked on a blank night sky.\nMarianson felt her happiness jarred as the wonderful day came to such\nlimits. The English had the island. It might be searched for that young\ndeserter waiting for her help, and if she failed to get a boat, what\nmust be his fate?\n\nShe had entered the west door of the distillery. She found opportunity\nto slip out on the east side, for it was necessary to reach the dock\nand get a boat. She might risk being scalped, but a boat at any cost she\nwould have, and one was sent her--as to the fearless and determined\nall their desires are sent. She heard the thump of oars in rowlocks,\nbringing the relief guard, and with a swish, out of the void of the lake\na keel ran upon pebbles.\n\nSo easy had been the conquest of the island, the British regular found\nhis amusement in his duty, and a boat was taken from the dock to save\nhalf a mile of easy marching. It stood empty and waiting during a lax\nminute, while the responsibility of guarding was shifted; but perhaps\nbeing carelessly beached, though there was no tide on the strait, it\ndrifted away.\n\nMarianson, who had helped it drift, lay flat on the bottom and heard the\nrueful oaths of her enemies, forced to march back to the post. There\nwas no sail. She steered by a trailing oar until lighted distillery and\nblack cliff receded and it was safe for her to fix her sculls and row\nwith all her might.\n\nShe was so tired her heart physically ached when she slipped through\ndawn to a landing opposite the cave. There would be no more yesterdays,\nand there would be no time for farewells. The wash which drove her\nroughly to mooring drove with her the fact that she did not know even\nthe name of the man she was about to give up.\n\nMarianson turned and looked at the water he must venture upon, without\na sail to help him. It was not all uncovered from the night, but a long\npurple current ran out, as if God had made a sudden amethyst bridge\nacross the blue strait.\n\nReluctant as she was to call him from the cave, she dared not delay. The\nbreath of the virgin woods was overpoweringly sweet. Her hair clung to\nher forehead in moist rings, and her cheeks were pallid and wet with\nmist which rose and rose on all sides like clouds in a holy picture.\n\nHe was asleep.\n\nShe crouched down on cold hands and saw that. He had waited in the cave\nas he promised, and had fallen asleep. His back was towards her. Instead\nof lying at ease, his body was flexed. Her enlarging pupils caught a\nstain of red on the bear-skin, then the scarlet tonsure on his crown. He\nwas asleep, but the Sioux had been there.\n\nThe low song of wind along that wooded ridge, and the roar of dashing\nlake water, repeated their monotone hour after hour. It proved as fair a\nday as the island had ever seen, and when it was nearly spent, Marianson\nBruelle still sat on the cave floor holding the dead boy in her arms.\nHeart-uprooting was a numbness, like rapture. At least he could not\nleave her. She had his kiss, his love. She had his body, to hide in a\ngrave as secret as a flower's. The curé could some time bless it, but\nthe English who had slain him should never know it. As she held him to\nher breast, so the sweet processes of the woods should hold him, and\nmake him part of the island.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
