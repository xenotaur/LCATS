    "body": "George H. Cutter wheeled his big convertible into his reserved space in\nthe Company parking lot with a flourish. A bright California sun drove\nits early brightness down on him as he strode toward the square,\nfour-story brick building which said _Cutter Products, Inc._ over its\nfront door. A two-ton truck was grinding backward, toward the loading\ndoors, the thick-shouldered driver craning his neck. Cutter moved\nbriskly forward, a thick-shouldered man himself, though not very tall. A\nglint of light appeared in his eyes, as he saw Kurt, the truck driver,\nfitting the truck's rear end into the tight opening.\n\n\"Get that junk out of the way!\" he yelled, and his voice roared over the\nnoise of the truck's engine.\n\nKurt snapped his head around, his blue eyes thinning, then recognition\nspread humor crinkles around his eyes and mouth. \"All right, sir,\" he\nsaid. \"Just a second while I jump out, and I'll lift it out of your\nway.\"\n\n\"With bare hands?\" Cutter said.\n\n\"With bare hands,\" Kurt said.\n\nCutter's laugh boomed, and as he rounded the front of the truck, he\nstruck the right front fender with his fist. Kurt roared back from the\ncab with his own laughter.\n\nHe liked joking harshly with Kurt and with the rest of the truck\ndrivers. They were simple, and they didn't have his mental strength. But\nthey had another kind of strength. They had muscle and energy, and most\nimportant, they had guts. Twenty years before Cutter had driven a truck\nhimself. The drivers knew that, and there was a bond between them, the\ndrivers and himself, that seldom existed between employer and employee.\n\nThe guard at the door came to a reflex attention, and Cutter bobbed his\nhead curtly. Then, instead of taking the stairway that led up the front\nto the second floor and his office, he strode down the hallway to the\nleft, angling through the shop on the first floor. He always walked\nthrough the shop. He liked the heavy driving sound of the machines in\nhis ears, and the muscled look of the men, in their coarse work shirts\nand heavy-soled shoes. Here again was strength, in the machines and in\nthe men.\n\nAnd here again too, the bond between Cutter and his employees was a\nthing as real as the whir and grind and thump of the machines, as real\nas the spray of metal dust, spitting away from a spinning saw blade. He\nwas able to drive himself through to them, through the hard wall of\nunions and prejudices against business suits and white collars and soft\nclean hands, because they knew that at one time he had also been a\nmachinist and then tool and die operator and then a shop foreman. He got\nthrough to them, and they respected him. They were even inspired by him,\nCutter knew, by his energy and alertness and steel confidence. It was\none good reason why their production continually skimmed along near the\ntop level of efficiency.\n\nCutter turned abruptly and started up the metal-lipped concrete steps to\nthe second floor. He went up quickly, his square, almost chunky figure\nmoving smoothly, and there was not the faintest shortening in his breath\nwhen he reached the level of his own office.\n\nComing up the back steps required him to cross the entire administration\noffice which contained the combined personnel of Production Control,\nProcurement, and Purchasing. And here, the sharp edge of elation,\nwhetted by the walk past the loading dock and the truck drivers and the\nmachine shop and the machinists, was dulled slightly.\n\nOn either side of him as he paced rapidly across the room, were the rows\nof light-oak desks which contained the kind of men he did not like:\nfragile men, whether thin or fat, fragile just the same, in the eyes and\nmouth, and pale with their fragility. They affected steel postures\nbehind those desks, but Cutter knew that the steel was synthetic, that\nthere was nothing in that mimicked look of alertness and virility but\nposing. They were a breed he did not understand, because he had never\nbeen a part of them, and so this time, the invisible but very real\nquality of employer-employee relationship turned coldly brittle, like\nfrozen cellophane.\n\nThe sounds now, the clicking of typewriters, the sliding of file\ndrawers, the squeak of adjusted swivel chairs--all of it--irritated him,\nrather than giving him inspiration, and so he hurried his way,\nespecially when he passed that one fellow with the sad, frightened eyes,\nwho touched his slim hands at the papers on his desk, like a cautious\nfawn testing the soundness of the earth in front of him. What was his\nname? Linden? God, Cutter thought, the epitome of the breed, this man:\nsallow and slow and so hesitant that he appeared to be about to leap\nfrom his chair at the slightest alarm.\n\nCutter broke his aloofness long enough to glare at the man, and Linden\nturned his frightened eyes quickly to his desk and began shuffling his\npapers nervously. Some day, Cutter promised himself, he was going to\nstop in front of the man and shout, \"Booo!\" and scare the poor devil to\nhell and back.\n\nHe pushed the glass doors that led to his own offices, and moving into\nLucile's ante-room restored his humor. Lucile, matronly yet quick and\nyouthfully spirited, smiled at him and met his eyes directly. Here was\nsome strength again, and he felt the full energy of his early-morning\ndrive returning fully. Lucile, behind her desk in this plain but\nexpensive reception room, reminded him of fast, hard efficiency, the\nquality of accomplishment that he had dedicated himself to.\n\n\"Goddamned sweet morning, eh, Lucy?\" he called.\n\n\"Beautiful, George,\" she said. She had called him by his first name for\nyears. He didn't mind, from her. Not many could do it, but those who\ncould, successfully, he respected.\n\n\"What's up first?\" he asked, and she followed him into his own office.\nIt was a high-ceilinged room, with walls bare except for a picture of\nAlexander Hamilton on one wall, and an award plaque from the State\nChamber of Commerce on the opposite side of the room. He spun his\nleather-cushioned swivel chair toward him and sat down and placed his\nthick hands against the surface of the desk. Lucile took the only other\nchair in the office, to the side of the desk, and flipped open her\nappointment pad.\n\n\"Quay wants to see you right away. Says it's important.\"\n\nCutter nodded slightly and closed his eyes. Lucile went on, calling his\nappointments for the day with clicking precision. He stored the\ninformation, leaning back in his chair, adjusting his mind to each, so\nthat there would be no energy wasted during the hard, swift day.\n\n\"That's it,\" Lucile said. \"Do you want to see Quay?\"\n\n\"Send him in,\" Cutter said, and he was already leaning into his desk,\nsigning his name to the first of a dozen letters which he had dictated\ninto the machine during the last ten minutes of the preceding day.\n\nLucile disappeared, and three minutes later Robert Quay took her place\nin the chair beside Cutter's desk. He was a taller man than Cutter, and\nthinner. Still, there was an athletic grace about him, a sureness of\nstep and facial expression, that made it obvious that he was physically\nfit. He was single and only thirty-five, twelve years younger than\nCutter, but he had been with Cutter Products, Inc. for thirteen years.\nIn college he had been a Phi Beta Kappa and lettered three years on the\nvarsity as a quarterback. He was the kind of rare combination that\nCutter liked, and Cutter had offered him more than the Chicago Cardinals\nto get him at graduation.\n\nCutter felt Quay's presence, without looking up at him. \"Goddamned sweet\nmorning, eh, Bob?\"\n\n\"It really is, George,\" Quay said.\n\n\"What's up?\" Cutter stopped signing, having finished the entire job, and\nhe stared directly into Quay's eyes. Quay met the stare unflinchingly.\n\n\"I've got a report from Sid Perry at Adacam Research.\"\n\n\"Your under-cover agent again, eh?\"\n\nQuay grinned. Adacam Research conducted industrial experimentation which\nincluded government work. The only way to find out what really went on\nthere, Cutter had found out, was to find a key man who didn't mind\ntalking for a certain amount of compensation, regardless of sworn oaths\nand signatures to government statements. You could always get somebody,\nCutter knew, and Quay had been able to get a young chemist, Sidney\nPerry.\n\n\"Okay,\" Cutter said. \"What are they doing over there?\"\n\n\"There's a fellow who's offered Adacam his project for testing. They're\nhighly interested, but they're not going to handle it.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\nQuay shrugged. \"Too touchy. It's a device that's based on electronics--\"\n\n\"What the hell is touchy about electronics?\"\n\n\"This deals with the human personality,\" Quay said, as though that were\nexplanation enough.\n\nCutter understood. He snorted. \"Christ, anything that deals with the\nhuman personality scares them over there, doesn't it?\"\n\nQuay spread his hands.\n\n\"All right,\" Cutter said. \"What's this device supposed to do?\"\n\n\"The theory behind it is to produce energy units which reach a plane of\nintensity great enough to affect the function of the human ego.\"\n\n\"Will it?\" Cutter never wasted time on surprise or curiosity or theory.\nHis mind acted directly. Would it or wouldn't it? Performance versus\nnon-performance. Efficiency versus inefficiency. Would it improve\nproduction of Cutter Products, Inc., or would it not?\n\n\"Sid swears they're convinced it will. The factors, on paper, check out.\nBut there's been no experimentation, because it involves the human\npersonality. This thing, when used, is supposed to perform a definite\npersonality change on the individual subjected.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"You know the theory of psychiatric therapy--the theory of shock\ntreatment. The effect is some what similar, but a thousand times more\neffective.\"\n\n\"What _is_ the effect?\"\n\n\"A gradual dissolving of inferiority influences, or inhibitions, from\nthe personality. A clear mind resulting. A healthy ego.\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"Confidence.\"\n\nCutter stared at Quay's eyes, assimilating the information. \"That's all\nvery damned nice. Now where does it fit in with Cutter Products?\"\n\nQuay drew a notebook from his coat pocket swiftly. \"You remember that\nefficiency check we had made two months ago--the rating of individual\ndepartments on comparable work produced?\"\n\nCutter nodded.\n\nQuay looked at his notebook. \"All administrative personnel departments\nshowed an average of--\"\n\n\"Thirty-six point eight less efficiency than the skilled and unskilled\nlabor departments,\" Cutter finished.\n\nQuay smiled slightly. He snapped the notebook shut. \"Right. So that's\nour personnel efficiency bug.\"\n\n\"Christ, I've known that for twenty years,\" Cutter snapped.\n\n\"Okay,\" Quay said quickly, alerting himself back to the serious effort.\n\"Now then, you'll remember we submitted this efficiency report to\nBabcock and Steele for analysis, and their report offered no answer,\nbecause their experience showed that you _always_ get that kind of\nratio, because of personality differences. The administrative personnel\nshow more inferiority influences per man, thus less confidence, thus\nless efficiency.\"\n\n\"I remember all that,\" Cutter said.\n\n\"Their report also pointed out that this inevitable loss of efficiency\nis leveled out, by proportionately smaller wage compensation. The\nadministrative personnel gets approximately twenty-five percent less\ncompensation than the skilled labor personnel, and the remaining eleven\npoint eight percent loss of efficiency is made up by the more highly\nefficient unskilled labor receiving approximately the same compensation\nas the administrative personnel.\"\n\n\"I remember all that nonsense, too,\" Cutter reddened faintly with a\nsudden anger. He did not believe the statistics were nonsense, only that\nyou should expect to write off a thirty-six point eight efficiency loss\non the basis of adjusted compensation. A thirty-six point eight\nefficiency loss was a comparable loss in profits. You never compensated\na loss in profits, except by erasing that loss. \"And so this is supposed\nto fix it?\"\n\nQuay's head bobbed. \"It's worth a try, it seems to me. I've talked to\nSid about it extensively, and he tells me that Bolen, who's developed\nthis thing, would be willing to install enough units to cover the entire\nadministrative force, from the department-head level down.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\nQuay motioned a hand. \"It's no larger than a slightly thick saucer. It\ncould be put inside the chairs.\" Quay smiled faintly. \"They sit on it,\nyou see, and--\"\n\nCutter was not amused. \"How much?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Quay said quickly. \"Absolutely nothing. Bolen wants actual\ntests badly, and the Institute wouldn't do it. Snap your fingers, and\ngive him a hundred and fifty people to work on, and it's yours to use\nfor nothing. He'll do the installing, and he _wants_ to keep it secret.\nIt's essential, he says, to get an accurate reaction from the subjects\naffected. For him it's perfect, because we're running a continuous\nefficiency check, and if this thing does the job like it's supposed to\ndo it, we'll have gained the entire benefits for nothing. How can we\nlose?\"\n\nCutter stared at Quay for a moment, his mind working swiftly. \"Call\nHorner in on this, but nobody else. Absolutely nobody else. Tell Horner\nto write up a contract for this fellow to sign. Get a clause in there to\nthe effect that this fellow, Bolen, assumes all responsibility for any\neffects not designated in the defining part of the contract. Fix it up\nso that he's entirely liable, then get it signed, and let's see what\nhappens.\"\n\nQuay smiled fully and stood up. \"Right, sir.\" He had done a good job, he\nknew. This was the sort of thing that would keep him solidly entrenched\nin Cutter's favor. \"Right, George,\" he said, remembering that he didn't\nneed to call Cutter sir anymore, but he knew he wouldn't hear any more\nfrom Cutter, because Cutter was already looking over a blueprint, eyes\nthin and careful, mind completely adjusted to a new problem.\n\n\n\nEdward Bolen called the saucer-sized disk, the Confidet. He was a thin,\nshort, smiling man with fine brown hair which looked as though it had\njust been ruffled by a high wind, and he moved, Cutter noticed, with\nquick, but certain motions. The installing was done two nights after\nCutter's lawyer, Horner, had written up the contract and gotten it\nsigned by Bolen. Only Quay, Bolen, and Cutter were present.\n\nBolen fitted the disks into the base of the plastic chair cushions, and\nhe explained, as he inserted one, then another:\n\n\"The energy is inside each one, you see. The life of it is indefinite,\nand the amount of energy used is proportionate to the demand created.\"\n\n\"What the hell do you mean by energy?\" Cutter demanded, watching the\nsmall man work.\n\nBolen laughed contentedly, and Quay flushed with embarrassment over\nanyone laughing at a question out of Cutter's lips. But Cutter did not\nreact, only looked at Bolen, as though he could see somehow, beneath\nthat smallness and quietness, a certain strength. Quay had seen that\nlook on Cutter's face before, and it meant simply that Cutter would\nwait, analyzing expertly in the meantime, until he found his advantage.\nQuay wondered, if this gadget worked, how long Bolen would own the\nrights to it.\n\n\nCutter drove the Cadillac into Hallery Boulevard, as though the\nautomobile were an English Austin, and just beyond the boundaries of the\ncity, cut off into the hills, sliding into the night and the relative\ndarkness of the exclusive, sparsely populated Green Oaks section.\n\nTen minutes later, his house, a massive stone structure which looked as\nthough it had been shifted intact from the center of some medieval moat,\nloomed up, gray and stony, and Capra, his handyman, took over the car\nand drove it into the garage, while Cutter strode up the wide steps to\nthe door.\n\nNiels took his hat, and Mary was waiting for him in the library.\n\nShe was a rather large woman, although not fat, and when she wore high\nheels--which she was not prone to do, because although Cutter would not\nhave cared, she kept trying to project into other people's minds and\ntrying, as she said, \"Not to do anything to them, that I wouldn't want\nthem to do to me.\"--she rose a good inch above Cutter. She was pleasant\nhumored, and cooperative, and the one great irritant about her that\nannoyed Cutter, was the fact that she was not capable of meeting life\nwholeheartedly and with strength.\n\nShe steadily worried about other people's feelings and thoughts, so that\nCutter wondered if she were capable of the slightest personal\nconviction. Yet that weakness was an advantage at the same time, to him,\nbecause she worked constantly toward making him happy. The house was run\nto his minutest liking, and the servants liked her, so that while she\ndid not use a strong enough hand, they somehow got things done for her,\nand Cutter had no real complaint. Someday, he knew, he would be able to\ndevelop her into the full potential he knew she was capable of\nachieving, and then there wouldn't be even that one annoyance about her.\n\nHe sat down in the large, worn, leather chair, and she handed him a\nScotch and water, and kissed his cheek, and then sat down opposite him\nin a smaller striped-satin chair.\n\n\"Did you have a nice day, dear?\" she asked.\n\nShe was always pleasant and she always smiled at him, and she was\nindeed a handsome woman. They had been married but five years, and she\nwas almost fifteen years younger than he, but they had a solid\nunderstanding. She respected his work, and she was careful with the\nmoney he allowed her, and she never forgot the Scotch and water. \"The\nday was all right,\" he said.\n\n\"My goodness,\" she said, \"you worked late. Do you want dinner right\naway?\"\n\n\"I had some sandwiches at the office,\" he said, drinking slowly.\n\n\"That isn't enough,\" she said reproachfully, and he enjoyed her concern\nover him. \"You'd better have some nice roast beef that Andre did just\nperfectly. And there's some wonderful dressing that I made myself, for\njust a small salad.\"\n\nHe smiled finally. \"All right,\" he said. \"All right.\"\n\nShe got up and kissed him again, and he relaxed in the large chair,\nsipping contentedly at his drink, listening to her footsteps hurrying\naway, the sound another indication that she was doing something for him.\nHe felt tired and easy. He let his mind relax with his body. The gadget,\nthe Confidet; that was going to work, he knew. It would erase the last\nimportant bug in his operational efficiency, and then he might even\nexpand, the way he had wanted to all along. He closed his eyes for a\nmoment, tasting of his contentment, and then he heard the sound of his\ndinner being placed on the dining room table, and he stood up briskly\nand walked out of the library. He really was hungry, he realized. Not\nonly hungry but, he thought, he might make love to Mary that evening.\n\n\n\nThe first indication that the Confidet might be working, came three\nweeks later, when Quay handed Cutter the report showing an efficiency\nincrease of 3.7 percent. \"I think that should tell the story,\" Quay said\nelatedly.\n\n\"Doesn't mean anything,\" Cutter said. \"Could be a thousand other factors\nbesides that damned gimmick.\"\n\n\"But we've never been able to show more than one point five variance on\nthe administrative checks.\"\n\n\"The trouble with you, Quay,\" Cutter said brusquely, \"is you keep\nlooking for miracles. You think the way to get things in this world is\nto hope real hard. Nothing comes easy, and I've got half a notion to get\nthose damned silly things jerked out.\" He bent over his work, obviously\nfinished with Quay, and Quay, deflated, paced out of the office.\n\nCutter smiled inside the empty office. He liked to see Quay's enthusiasm\nbroken now and then. It took that, to mold a really good man, because\nthat way he assumed real strength after a while. If he got knocked down\nand got up enough, he didn't fall apart when he hit a really tough\nobstacle. Cutter was not unhappy about the efficiency figures at all,\nand he knew as well as Quay that they were decisive.\n\nGive it another two weeks, he thought, and if the increase was\ncomparable, then they might have a real improvement on their hands.\nThose limp, jumpy creatures on the desks out there might actually start\nearning their keep. He was thinking about that, what it would mean to\nthe total profit, when Lucile opened his door and he caught a glimpse of\nthe office outside, including the clerk with the sad, frightened eyes.\nEven you, Linden, Cutter thought, we might even improve you.\n\n\nThe increase _was_ comparable after another two weeks. In fact, the\nefficiency figure jumped to 8.9. Quay was too excited to be knocked down\nthis time, and Cutter was unable to suppress his own pleasure.\n\n\"This is really it this time, George,\" Quay said. \"It really is. And\nhere.\" He handed Cutter a set of figures. \"Here's what accounting\nestimates the profit to be on this eight-nine figure.\"\n\nCutter nodded, his eyes thinning the slightest bit. \"We won't see that\nfor a while.\"\n\n\"No,\" Quay said, \"but we'll see it! We'll sure as hell see it! And if it\ngoes much higher, we'll absolutely balance out!\"\n\n\"What does Bolen figure the top to be?\"\n\n\"Ten percent.\"\n\n\"Why not thirty-six point eight?\" Cutter said, his eyes bright and\nnarrow.\n\nQuay whistled. \"Even at ten, at the wage we're paying--\"\n\n\"Never settle for quarters or thirds,\" Cutter said. \"Get the whole\nthing. Send for Bolen. I want to talk to him. And in the meantime, Bob,\nthis is such a goddamned sweet morning, what do you say we go to lunch\nearly?\"\n\nQuay blinked only once, which proved his adaptability. Cutter had just\nasked him to lunch, as though it were their habit to lunch together\nregularly, when in reality, Quay had never once gone to lunch with\nCutter before. Quay was quite nonchalant, however, and he said, \"Why,\nfine, George. I think that's a good idea.\"\n\n\n\nBolen appeared in Cutter's office the next morning, smiling, his eyes\ndarting quickly about Cutter's desk and walls, so that Cutter felt, for\na moment, that showing Bolen anything as personal as his office, was a\nlittle like letting the man look into his brain.\n\n\"Quay tells me you've set ten percent as the top efficiency increase we\ncan count on, Bolen.\" Cutter said it directly, to the point.\n\nBolen smiled, examining Cutter's hands and suit and eyes. \"That's right,\nMr. Cutter.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nBolen placed his small hands on his lap, looked at the tapered fingers,\nthen up again at Cutter. He kept smiling. \"It's a matter of saturation.\"\n\n\"How in hell could ten percent more efficiency turn into saturation?\"\n\n\"Not ten percent more efficiency,\" Bolen said quietly. \"Ten percent\n_effect_ on the individual who _creates_ the efficiency. Ten percent\neffect of that which _causes_ him to be ten percent more efficient.\"\n\nCutter snorted. \"Whatever the hell that damned gimmick does, it creates\nconfidence, drive, strength, doesn't it? Isn't that what you said?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Bolen said politely. \"Approximately.\"\n\n\"Can you explain to me then, how ten percent more confidence in a man is\nsaturation?\"\n\nBolen studied what he was going to say carefully, smiling all the while.\n\"Some men,\" he said very slowly, \"are different than others, Mr. Cutter.\nSome men will react to personality changes as abrupt as this in\ndifferent ways than others. You aren't too concerned, are you, with what\nthose changes might already have done to any of the individuals\naffected?\"\n\n\"Hell, no,\" Cutter said loudly. \"Why should I be? All I'm interested in\nis efficiency. Tell me about efficiency, and I'll know what you're\ntalking about.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Bolen said. \"We have no way of knowing right now which men\nhave been affected more than others. All we have is an average. The\naverage right now is eight and nine-tenths percent. But perhaps you have\nsome workers who do not react, because they really do not suffer the\nlacks or compulsions or inhibitions that the Confidet is concerned with.\nPerhaps they are working at top efficiency right now, and no amount of\nfurther subjection to the Confidet will change them.\"\n\n\"All right then,\" Cutter said quickly, \"we'll ferret that kind of\ndeadwood out, and replace them!\"\n\n\"How will you know which are deadwood?\" Bolen asked pleasantly.\n\n\"Individual checks, of course!\"\n\nBolen shook his head, looking back at his tapering fingers. \"It won't\nnecessarily work. You see, the work that these men are concerned with is\nnot particularly demanding work, is it? And that means you want to\nstrike a balance between capability and demand. It's the unbalance of\nthese things that creates trouble, and in your case, the demand\noutweighed the capability. Now, if you get a total ten-percent increase,\nthen you're balanced. If you go over that, you'll break the balance all\nover again, except that you'll have, in certain cases, capability\noutweighing the demand of the work.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Cutter said. \"Any man whose capability outweighs the work he's\ndoing will simply keep increasing his efficiency.\"\n\nBolen shook his head. \"No. He'll react quite the other way. He'll lose\ninterest, because the work will no longer be a challenge, and then the\nefficiency will drop.\"\n\nCutter's jaw hardened. \"All right then. I'll move that man up, and fill\nhis place with someone else.\"\n\nBolen looked at Cutter's eyes, examined them curiously. \"Some men have a\ngreat deal of latent talent, Mr. Cutter. This talent released--\"\n\nCutter frowned, studying Bolen carefully. Then he laughed suddenly. \"You\nthink I might not be able to handle it?\"\n\n\"Well, let's say that you've got a stable of gentle, quiet mares, and\nyou turn them suddenly into thoroughbreds. You have to make allowances\nfor that, Mr. Cutter. The same stalls, the same railings, the same\nstable boys might not be able to do the job anymore.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Cutter said, smiling without humor, \"but the _owner_ has nothing\nto do with stalls and railings and stable boys, only in the sense that\nthey are subsidiary. The owner is the owner, and if he has to make a few\nsubsidiary changes, all right. But nothing really affects the owner, no\nmatter whether you've got gentle mares or thoroughbreds.\"\n\nBolen nodded, as though he had expected that exact answer. \"You are a\nvery certain man, aren't you, Mr. Cutter?\"\n\n\"Would I be here, in this office, heading this company, if I weren't,\nBolen?\"\n\nBolen smiled.\n\nCutter straightened in his chair. \"All right, do we go on? Do we shoot\nfor the limit?\"\n\nBolen chose his words carefully. \"I am interested in testing my\nConfidet, Mr. Cutter. This is the most important thing in the world to\nme. I don't recommend what you want to do. But, as long as you'll give\nme accurate reports on the effects of the Confidet, I'll go along with\nyou. Providing you grant me one concession.\"\n\nCutter frowned.\n\n\"I want our written contract dissolved.\"\n\nCutter reddened faintly. Nobody ever demanded anything of him and got it\neasily, but his mind turned over rapidly, judging the increase in\nefficiency, the increase in profits. He would not necessarily have to\nstop with administrative personnel. There were other departments, too,\nthat could stand a little sharpening. Finally he nodded, reluctantly.\n\"All right, Bolen.\"\n\nBolen smiled and left quickly, and Cutter stared at his desk for a\nmoment, tense. Then, he relaxed and the hard sternness of his face\nsoftened a bit. He put his finger on his desk calendar, and looked at a\ndate Lucile had circled for him. He grinned, and picked up the\ntelephone, and dialed.\n\n\"This is George H. Cutter,\" he said to the man who answered. \"My wife's\nbirthday is next Saturday. Do you remember that antique desk I bought\nher last year? Good. Well, the truth is, she uses it all the time, so\nthis year I'd like a good chair to match it. She's just using an\noccasional chair right now, and...\"\n\n\n\nLike everything he gave her, Mary liked his gift extremely well, and\nnight after night, after the birthday, he came home to find her at the\ndesk, using the chair, captaining her house and her servant staff. And\nthe improvement was noticeable in her, almost from the first day. Within\na month, he could detect a remarkable change, and for the first time,\nsince they had been married, Mary gave a dinner for thirty people\nwithout crying just before it started.\n\nThere were other changes.\n\nQuay brought in efficiency report after efficiency report, and by the\nend of three months, they had hit eighteen and seven-tenths percent\nincrease. The administrative office was no longer the dull, listless\nplace it had been; now it thrived and hummed like the shop below. Cutter\ncould see the difference with his own eyes, and he could particularly\nsee the differences in certain individuals.\n\nBrown and Kennedy showed remarkable improvement, but it was really Harry\nLinden who astonished Cutter. An individual check showed a sixty-percent\nincrease by Linden, and there was a definite change in the man's looks.\nHe walked differently, with a quick, virile step, and the look of his\nface and eyes had become strong and alive. He began appearing early in\nthe morning, ahead of the starting hour, and working late, and the only\ntime he missed any work hours, was one afternoon, during which, Lucile\ninformed Cutter, he had appeared in court for his divorce trial.\n\nWithin a month, Cutter had fired Stole and Lackter and Grant, as\ndepartment heads, and replaced them with Brown, Kennedy, and Linden. He\nhad formulated plans for installation of the Confidets in the drafting\ndepartment and the supply department, and already the profits of\nincreased efficiency were beginning to show in the records. Cutter was\nfull of new enthusiasm and ambition, and there was only one thorn in the\nentire development.\n\nQuay had resigned.\n\nCutter had been startled and extremely angry, but Quay had been\nunperturbed and stubborn. \"I've enjoyed working with you immensely,\nGeorge, but my mind is made up. No hard feelings?\"\n\nCutter had not even shaken his hand.\n\nIt had bothered him for days, and he checked every industrial company in\nthe area, to see where Quay had found a better position. He was highly\nsurprised, when he learned, finally, that Quay had purchased a small\nboat and was earning his living by carrying fishermen out onto the Bay.\nQuay had also married, four days after his resignation, and Cutter\npushed the entire thing out of his mind, checking it off to partial\ninsanity.\n\nBy February of the next year, he had promoted Harry Linden to Quay's old\njob, gotten rid of the deadwood that showed up so plainly on the\nindividual checks, and the total efficiency average had reached\nthirty-three percent. His and Mary's anniversary was on the fourth of\nMarch, and when that day arrived, he was certain that he had reached\nthat point where he could expand to another plant.\n\nHe was about to order her a mink stole in celebration, but it was also\nthat day that he was informed that she was suing him for divorce. He\nrushed home, furious, but she was gone. She had taken her clothes and\njewelry and the second Cadillac. In fact, all that she had left of her\npersonal possessions were the antique desk and chair. When the trial was\nover, months later, she had won enough support to take her to France,\nwhere, he learned, she purchased a chateau at Cannes.\n\nHe tried to lose himself in his work, but for the first time in his\nlife, he had begun to get faintly worried. It was only a sliver of\nworry, but it kept him from going on with the expansion. Stocks in the\ncompany had turned over at an amazingly rapid rate, and while it was\nstill nothing more than intuition on his part, he began to tighten up,\nreadying himself to meet anything.\n\nThe explosion came in July.\n\nDrindor Products had picked up forty-nine percent of the stock on the\nmarket, by using secondary buyers. There had been a leak somewhere,\nCutter realized, that had told his competitor, Drindor, the kind of\nprofit he was making. He knew who it had been instantly, but before he\ncould fire Harry Linden, all of his walls crashed down. Four months\nbefore, to put more _esprit de corps_ into Linden, he had allowed\nLinden eight shares of his own stock, intending to pick it up later from\nthe market. Linden had coerced with Drindor. Cutter lost control.\n\nA board of directors was elected by Drindor, and Drindor assumed the\npresidency by proxy. Harry Linden took over Cutter's office, as Vice\nPresident In Charge.\n\nCutter had wildly ordered Edward Bolen to remove the Confidets one week\nbefore, but even then he had known that it was too late, and the\nsmiling, knowing look on Bolen's face had infuriated him to a screaming\nrage. Bolen remained undisturbed, and quietly carried the disks away.\nCutter, when he left his office that final day, moved slowly, very\nslowly.\n\n\n\nHe brooded for many long days after that, searching his mind for a way\nto counterattack. He still had enough stock to keep him comfortable if\nhe lived another hundred years. But he no longer had the power, and he\nthirsted for that. He turned it around and around in his brain, trying\nto figure out how he could do it, and the one thing he finally knew, the\none certain thing, was that if he used enough drive, enough strength,\nthen he would regain control of the company he had built with his own\nhands and mind.\n\nHe paced the library and the long living room and the dining room, and\nhis eyes were lost, until he saw, through the doorway of the sewing\nroom, that desk and that chair, and he remembered he hadn't done\nanything about that.\n\nHe paused only briefly, because he had not lost an ounce of his ability\nto make a sudden decision, and then he removed that disk and carried it\nto the library and fitted it under the cushion of the large, worn,\nleather chair.\n\n\nBy fall, he had done nothing to regain control, and he was less certain\nof how he should act than he had been months before. He kept driving by\nthe plant and looking at it, but he did so carefully, so that no one\nwould see him, and he was surprised to find that, above all, he didn't\nwant to face Harry Linden. The memory of the man's firm look, the sharp,\nbold eyes, frightened him, and the knowledge of his fright crushed him\ninside. He wished desperately that Mary were back with him, and he even\nwrote her letters, pleading letters, but they came back, unopened.\n\nFinally he went to see Robert Quay, because Quay was the only man in his\nmemory whom he somehow didn't fear talking to. He found Quay in a small\ncottage near the beach. There was a six-day old infant in a crib in the\nbedroom, and Quay's wife was a sparkling-eyed girl with a smile that\nmade Cutter feel relatively at ease for the first time in weeks.\n\nShe politely left them alone, and Cutter sat there, embarrassed faintly,\nbut glad to be in Quay's home and presence. They talked of how it had\nbeen, when Quay was with the company, and finally Cutter pushed himself\ninto asking about it:\n\n\"I've often wondered, Bob, why you left?\"\n\nQuay blushed slightly, then grinned. \"I might as well admit it. I got\none of those things from Bolen, and had it installed in my own chair.\"\n\nCutter thought about it, surprised. He cleared his throat. \"And then you\nquit?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Quay said. \"All my life, I'd wanted to do just what I'm doing.\nBut things just came easy to me, and the opportunities were always\nthere, and I just never had the guts to pass anything by. Finally I\ndid.\"\n\nQuay smiled at him, and Cutter shifted in his chair. \"The Confidet did\nthat.\"\n\nCutter nodded.\n\nIt came to him suddenly, something he'd never suspected until that\nmoment. There was something very definitely wrong with what had happened\nto him. The Confidet had affected everyone but him; there must have been\nsomething wrong with the one he had been using. It had worked with Mary,\nbut hadn't Bolen said something about the energy being used in\nproportion to the demand? Mary had certainly created a demand. Bolen\nsaid the life of it was indefinite, but couldn't the energy have been\nused up?\n\n\"Ah,\" he said carefully, smiling, to Quay. \"You wouldn't have it around,\nwould you? That Confidet of yours?\"\n\n\"Oh, hell, no,\" Quay said. \"I gave it to Bolen a long time ago. He came\naround for it, in fact. Said he had to keep track of all of them.\"\n\nCutter left hurriedly, with Quay and his wife following him to his car.\nHe drove straight to Bolen's house.\n\nFury built inside of him. All this time, Bolen had kept track of his\nConfidet, the one that Mary had used, and all this time, he had known\nCutter still had it. Cutter was furious over the realization that Bolen\nhad been using him for experimentation, and also because the Confidet\nthat he had tried to use had turned worthless.\n\nAll his hatred, all his anger churned inside of him like the heat from\nshaken coals, but when he walked up the path to Bolen's small house, he\ndid so quietly, with extreme care.\n\nWhen he saw Bolen's face in the doorway, he wanted to strike the man,\nbut he kept his hands quietly at his sides; and though he hated himself\nfor it, he even smiled a little at the man.\n\n\"Come in,\" Bolen smiled, and he spoke softly, and at the same time he\nexamined Cutter with quick, penetrating eyes. \"Come in, Mr. Cutter.\"\n\nCutter wanted to stand there and demand another Confidet, a good one,\nand not walk inside, politely, like he did. And he wished that his voice\nwould come out, quickly, with the power and hate in it that he had once\nbeen capable of. But for some reason, he couldn't say a word.\n\nBolen was extremely polite. \"You've been using that Confidet, haven't\nyou?\" He spoke gently, almost as though he were speaking to a frightened\nchild.\n\n\"Yes,\" Cutter managed to say.\n\n\"And what you expected to happen, didn't. That's what you want to tell\nme, isn't it?\"\n\nCutter's insides quivered with rage, but he was able only to nod.\n\n\"Would you like to know why?\" Bolen said.\n\nCutter rubbed his damp palms over his knees. He nodded.\n\nBolen smiled, his eyes sparkling. \"Very simple really. It wasn't the\nfault of the Confidet so much, Mr. Cutter, as you. You see, you are a\nrare exception. What you are, or possibly I should say, what you were,\nwas a complete super ego. There are very few of those, Mr. Cutter, in\nthis world, but you happened to be one of them. A really absolute,\ncomplete super ego, and the Confidet's effect was simply the reverse of\nwhat it would have been with anyone else.\" Bolen shook his head,\nsympathetically, but he didn't stop smiling, and his eyes didn't stop\ntheir infuriating exploration of Cutter's face and eyes and hands. \"It's\nreally a shame, because I was almost certain you were a super ego, Mr.\nCutter. And when you didn't return that last Confidet, I somehow felt\nthat you might use it, after all that nasty business at the company and\nall.\n\n\"But while I was fairly certain of the effects, Mr. Cutter, I wasn't\nabsolutely _sure_, you see, and so like the rest of the experiments, I\nhad to forget my conscience. I'm really very sorry.\"\n\nThe anger was a wild thing inside Cutter now, and it made his hands\ntremble and sweat, and his mouth quiver, and he hated the man in front\nof him, the man who was responsible for what had happened to him, the\nsmiling man with the soft voice and exploring eyes. But he didn't say\nanything, not a word. He didn't show his anger or his frustration or his\nresentment. He didn't indicate to Bolen a particle of his inner\nwildness.\n\nHe didn't have the nerve.\n\n\n\n\n",
