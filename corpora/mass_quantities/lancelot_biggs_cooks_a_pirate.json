    "body": "The whole trouble started with Slops. Slops wasn't a _bad_ cook, you\nunderstand. He just wasn't a cook at all, rightly speaking. He had\nwhat you might call a \"tapioca complex.\" It was tapioca for breakfast,\ntapioca for lunch, tapioca for dinner. Every day. Boiled tapioca,\nstewed tapioca, even fricasseed tapioca--\n\nUgh! When you hop gravs twice a month on a lugger shuttling between\nEarth and Venus, you can't get by forever on a diet of ta--that stuff!\n\nAnyhow, it finally got to be too much for even an iron-bellied old\nspacedog like Cap Hanson. So when we pulled into the Sun City airport,\nCap said firmly, \"You're through, Slops. And I do mean through!\" And he\nkicked our (alleged) chef off the _Saturn_, along with his clothing,\nhis back pay, his harmonica and his ta--you know what.\n\nWhich left us way out on the end of a limb, for it turned out that\nthere wasn't a single spaceriding cook dry-docked in Sun City. While\nthe _Saturn_ was taking on its cargo for Earth, pepsin and medical\nsupplies, mostly, with one or two holds full of _mekel_ and _clab_,\nthe Skipper did his doggonedest to scare up a grub-wrangler. But no\nsoap.\n\nAn hour before we were scheduled to blast off, he ambled up to my\ncontrol turret. He plumped himself into my easy chair and scratched his\ngray pate nervously.\n\n\"Damn it, Sparks,\" he complained, \"I thought I was doin' the right\nthing when I fired Slops, but--\"\n\n\"You were,\" I told him. \"By chucking that grease-ball off the ship you\nsaved fourteen lives. The crew. They were planning on either mutiny or\nmurder, they didn't care which, if they had to eat one more dish of\nthat goo.\"\n\n\"But,\" he continued worriedly, \"in another hour we throw lugs for\nEarth. And we don't have no cook. What the blue space are we goin' to\ndo?\"\n\nOur First Mate, Lancelot Biggs, had entered as the skipper was talking.\nNow he offered, helpfully, \"I'll ask Slops to come back if you want me\nto, Captain. I saw him at the Palace Bar--\"\n\n\"_No!_\" said the Cap and I in the same breath.\n\nBiggs looked hurt. His wobbly Adam's-apple bobbed in his throat like an\nunswallowed orange. And he defended, \"Well, after all, tapioca's good\nfor you! It contains valuable food elements that--\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" howled Cap Hanson. He wasn't in a mood to take advice from\nanybody, and especially Lancelot Biggs. Perhaps that was because our\nrecent \"transmuting trip,\" in the course of which we had attempted to\nturn lead jars to platinum by exposure to cosmic radiation, had failed.\nThe Corporation had carpeted Cap for that, and Cap was sore at Biggs\nbecause the whole thing had been Biggs' idea in the beginning. \"I'll\nmurder the guy who even mentions that--that stuff!\"\n\nMr. Biggs said aggrievedly, \"I was only trying to be helpful.\"\n\n\"You're as much help,\" the skipper told him caustically, \"as fins on a\ndicky-bird's chest. Now, git out of here! G'wan! Git!\"\n\nOur lanky first mate turned and started to leave the turret. And then,\nsuddenly--\n\n\"Wait a minute!\" yelped Cap Hanson. \"Where do you think you're goin',\nMr. Biggs?\"\n\nBiggs gulped, \"Why--why you told me to--\"\n\n\"Never mind what I said! Do what I say! I think I've got the\nsolution. Mr. Biggs, that cranium of yours appears to be stuffed with\nmiscellaneous lore. Do you by any chance happen to know anything about\nthe art of cooking?\"\n\n\"Who?\" said Biggs. \"Me? Why, no, Captain. But I don't imagine it would\nbe very difficult. After all, it is based on elementary chemical\nprocesses. By exposing certain organic substances to the action of\nhydrogen dioxide, under suitable thermostatic conditions--\"\n\nCap Hanson's jaw dropped open. He goggled at me. \"Wh-what's he sayin',\nSparks?\"\n\n\"He means,\" I translated, \"that cooking is easy. All you need is water,\nheat and victuals.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" The skipper grinned ghoulishly. \"In that case, our problem's\nsolved. Mr. Biggs, you've just earned a new private office an' a new\nunyform. You'll find both of 'em below decks, third door on your right.\"\n\nIt was Biggs' turn to look shocked. His protuberant larynx performed a\nreverse Immelmann. \"H-huh? But I'm not a cook, Captain. I'm your First\nMate!\"\n\n\"You _was_ my First Mate,\" corrected the Old Man coolly, \"until just\nnow. The IPS codebook says, 'It is the Captain's privilege to draft any\nmember of crew or command for any duty in times of emergency.' This\nis an emergency. An' besides, you just got done sayin' that cookin'\nis simply a matter of exposin' certain hoochamacallits to the action\nof thingamajigs. So--\" He brushed his hairy paws with a gesture of\nfinality, \"That's that! To the galley, Mr. Slops!\"\n\n\n\nAnd he was right. That was that. But the funny part of it was that,\nforced to a showdown, Lancelot Biggs came through!\n\nThe first meal out, which was lunch served at noon Earthtime, I\nwent down to the dining hall thinking anything might happen and\nexpecting the worst. I got the shock of my life, and shocks are a not\ninconsiderable part of the life of a spacelugger radioman.\n\nMr. Lancelot Slops had pulled a banquet out of the hat! We had fried\nchicken with cream gravy, hot biscuits, candied yams, a side dish of\nstewed _clab_, Creole style, raisin pie, and the best damn coffee ever\nserved on the wallowing old _Saturn_.\n\nWhat the other men of the crew thought, I have no idea. They didn't\nsay. Every man-jack of 'em was so busy shoveling grub into his puss\nthat the conversation was dead as a Martian herring. But after I'd\nbulged my belt to the last notch with fried pullet, I waddled into the\ngalley and confronted Mr. Biggs.\n\n\"Biggs,\" I said accusingly, \"you've been holding out on us! Why didn't\nyou tell us before you could cook a meal like that?\"\n\nHe shuffled his feet sheepishly. He said, \"Was it all right, Sparks?\"\n\n\"All right? It was terrific! I haven't had such a feed since I was a\nkid.\"\n\nHe looked relieved. \"I'm glad. Because, you see, that was the first\nmeal I ever cooked.\"\n\n\"It was the first--_what!_\"\n\n\"Mmm-hmm! But there were lots of cook books here in the galley. And\nI figured so long as I had to do it, I might as well do it right--\"\nHe grinned at me shyly. Once in a while I wondered, briefly, whether\nany of us understood this strange, lanky genius, Lancelot Biggs. This\nwas one of the times. \"I--I found it rather interesting, Sparks, to\ntell you the truth. It is, just as I told Cap Hanson, just a matter of\nelementary chemistry. The pots and pans are the test-tubes; the stove\nis a huge Bunsen burner.\"\n\nI said admiringly, \"I'll hand you one thing, Mr. Biggs. You believe in\nsticking to theories, don't you?\"\n\n\"But of course. 'Get the theory first'; that's the big secret of\nsuccess in any undertaking.\" He looked pleased and a little excited,\ntoo. \"We're going to have a good trip home, Sparks. There's plenty of\nfood here to experiment with. And in the holds--\"\n\nIt was just then that I caught my number being buzzed on the\nintercommunicating audio. I cut through and yelled, \"Sparks speaking.\nWhat's up?\"\n\n\"Sparks?\" It was my relief man calling from the radio room. \"You'd\nbetter come up here on the double. A message from Sun City, and I think\nit's bad news.\"\n\n\"Right with you,\" I hollered. I snapped a brief \"See you later!\" to\nBiggs and raced up the Jacob's ladder to the turret. My relief man was\nthere, also Cap Hanson and the second-in-command, Lt. Todd. All three\nof them looked a bit grim and a bit glum and quite a bit apprehensive.\nMy relief shoved a wire flimsy into my hand. It was a cipher message\nfrom Sun City spaceport. I knew the code as well as I know English and\nUniversal, so I read it aloud.\n\n\"HANSON COMMANDER IPS SATURN EN ROUTE VENUS-EARTH. TURN BACK\nIMMEDIATELY FOR CONVOY. PIRATE HAKE REPORTED ON COORDINATES THREE\nFIFTEEN PLUS NINE OH NINE YOUR TRAJECTORY.\" It was signed, \"Allonby,\nComm. S.S.C.B.\"\n\nI stared at Cap Hanson, wondering if my face were as queasy as my tummy\nfelt. I said, \"Hake! Runt Hake!\"\n\nHanson said, \"Yes, but that's not the worst of it, Sparks. Tell him,\nMr. Todd.\"\n\nTodd wet his lips and faltered, \"We--we're in a serious spot, Sparks.\nWe accelerated to max twenty minutes ago and cut motors for the free\nrun. And since we had--or thought we had--almost nine days of idleness,\nI told Chief Engineer Garrity he could take down that number. Three\nhypatomic that's been missing.\"\n\nThat still didn't make sense. I said, \"So he took it down? So what? He\ncan put it together again, can't he?\"\n\n\"No. He found the casing worn, melted it down for a recast. We--we\ncan't recase it for at least two days!\"\n\n\n\nFor the sake of you Earthlubbers who don't get the lingo, let me say it\nin words of one syllable. We were in a hell of a jam! The hypatomics\nare the motors that operate spacecraft. In this case, one of them had\nshown signs of weakness. With the ship \"free wheeling,\" so to speak,\nin space, the engineers had taken down the faulty motor, discovered it\nneeded remoulding, and had melted down the casing. As Todd had said, it\nwould take at least two days--probably more--to recast the moulding,\nput the hyp together again, so we could blast.\n\nBut the worst of if was--Hake! Runt Hake. There are pirates and pirates\nin the wide transverses between the planets. Some of them are good\nguys, that is, if an outlaw can ever be considered a \"good guy.\" Like\nLark O'Day, for instance, that gay, smiling bandit who always gave\nlugger captains a signed receipt for the cargoes he stole, and who had\nonce let a tramp freighter go through untouched because the Captain\nacknowledged his life savings were wrapped up in the cargo. Who had\nonce stopped a passenger superliner for the express purpose of stealing\na single kiss from its charming passenger, the newly crowned \"Miss\nUniverse.\"\n\nBut others were skunks and dogs and--well, think of the nastiest things\nyou can think of. Then multiply by ten, add infinity, and you have Runt\nHake.\n\nRunt Hake was a killer. A throwback to the rotten old days when men's\nfirst thoughts were of death and, war and violence. He was a pirate\nnot so much because of the value of the cargoes he lifted as because\nhe liked to do battle. And he had a sadistic strain in him somewhere.\nHis idea of good clean fun was to board a freighter--like the\n_Saturn_--unload the cargo at his convenience, then blast a slow leak\nthrough the outer hull.\n\nAfter--I might mention--having first removed all lifeskiffs and bulgers\nfrom the ill-fated victim. Once, in the asteroid Sargossa, I saw a ship\nthat had been scuttled by Runt Hake's cutthroat crew. Its crew still\nremained with the ship. But not as recognizable human beings. As raw\nand frozen clots of pressured flesh.\n\nOh, a swell guy, this Runt Hake. And now we, disabled and helpless,\nwere drifting right into the trajectory where he awaited us.\n\nCap Hanson said grimly, \"There's nothin' much that we can do about it,\nof course. We've got one six millimeter rotor-gun for'rd. We'll give\nhim that.\"\n\n\"And get ourselves blown to atoms,\" interjected Todd, \"with his\npierce-guns. No, Skipper, that's no good. But how about the Ampie? If\nwe set out our Ampie, maybe--\"\n\nAn \"Ampie\" is that strange, energy-devouring beast from Venus whose\ninordinate appetite for electrical power forms a shield for spaceships\npenetrating the Heaviside layers of the various planets. It wasn't\naltogether a bad idea. But Hanson shook his head.\n\n\"No. It wouldn't work. An Ampie couldn't take a heat ray. There's\nonly one thing to do. Send word for the convoy to come on the\ndouble-quick--and hope it reaches us before we run into Hake.\"\n\nThat was my cue. I shoved the relief man to hell off the bench and got\nthe wobble-bug going. And, mister, I filled the ether with SOS's--and\nadded a couple of PDQ's for good measure. I picked up an acknowledgment\nfrom Sun City, and threw them a hasty explanation. They wired back that\nthe convoy cruiser would make all haste, and to not be frightened....\n\nHa! Can I help it if my knees chatter?\n\n\n\nThere was one thing you could absolutely depend on Lancelot Biggs to\ndo. And that was--stick his nose in at the wrong minute. For as we\nthree were giving the sob-towel the good old go-over, the door popped\nopen and who gangled in but Mr. Slops, First-Mate-and-Bottle-Washer!\nHis face, in contrast to ours, was radiant with joy and delight. He had\na grin on his phizz that stretched from here to there and back again.\nHe chortled, \"Hey, Cap--\"\n\n\"Go 'way!\" mourned Cap Hanson. \"I'm thinking.\"\n\n\"But, look!\" Biggs opened one hamlike paw. And there was a wee, gray\nship-mouse. He placed it on the floor before him. \"Look what I found in\nthe No. 4 Bin. It acts so darned funny--\"\n\n\"Go 'way!\" repeated the skipper, still gloomily. \"If you make me lose\nmy temper--\"\n\nBiggs said, \"But he _does_ act funny--\" And to tell you the truth, the\nlittle mouse did. Usually, you know, a mouse is the scaredyest thing\nalive. Put him down in a place like this, surrounded by giant humans,\nand he'll run like mad to the darkest corner.\n\nBut this little twerp didn't run. Matter of fact, he deliberately moved\nto the man nearest him, Todd, that was, and began to nuzzle himself\nagainst Todd's shoe! Just as if the Lieutenant were an old and loved\nacquaintance! Mr. Biggs chuckled again.\n\n\"See that? Do you know what makes him act that way, Skipper? I'll tell\nyou. It's the prol--\"\n\n\"_Mister Biggs!_\" The Old Man's face was fiery red with rage. \"This is\nno time for nonsense. Within hours, or perhaps minutes, we may all be\ndead! Now, for the last time, get out of here!\"\n\nBiggs, sort of stunned, said, \"Y-yes, sir!\" He retrieved his\ncuriously-acting little pet from where it rubbed its soft muzzle\nagainst Todd's shoelaces, put it in his pocket, and backed out the\ndoorway. As he went he tossed me a beseeching wigwag. I nodded; then\nwhen no one was paying me any neverminds, joined him in the runway\noutside.\n\n\"What's the matter, Sparks?\" he demanded.\n\nI gave it to him, both barrels. He had a right to know. Every man has\na right to know when it's bye-bye time. \"But don't tell the crew,\" I\nwarned. \"The Old Man'll do that if he thinks best.\"\n\nBiggs' eyes were huge and round. \"Runt Hake! Gee, no wonder the Skipper\nwas cross.\" He plunged into one of his characteristic silences. Then,\nsuddenly, \"Hey!\"\n\n\"Hey, what?\"\n\n\"They say Hake is a show-off. Likes to crack the whip on captured\nships, ordering up big meals and so on before he scuttles it--\"\n\n\"Well?\" I said. \"You think you're going to poison him, maybe? Don't be\na dope. He'll make you swallow a pussfull of everything you serve him.\"\n\n\"Never mind. I'm not sure my idea is any good--yet! But have you got a\nbook on physiochemistry?\"\n\n\"In my office.\"\n\n\"Swell. Get it for me, will you? I'll explain later.\"\n\nWell, I got him the book and he jammed it into his pocket and\ndisappeared toward the galley, jogging along like a stork on stilts.\nBut I had no time, now, to laugh at Biggs' physical or mental\npeculiarities.\n\nBecause my ears had just caught a sound they did not want to catch.\nThe sound of metal grating on metal near the off-port. The banging of\na mailed fist on _permalloy_, the asthmatic wheeze of the airlock, a\nsailor's shout ending in a choked gurgle--\n\nI charged back into the radioroom. \"Cap,\" I yelled, \"at the airlock!\nSomebody. It must be--\"\n\nIt was. Runt Hake and his pirates.\n\n\n\nYou wouldn't think, to look at Runt Hake, that he was a killer. True,\nhe held a hand pierce gun on us as he approached, moving smoothly,\nlightly, up the runway. A half dozen men behind him also held their\nside arms poised, ready for action, while another half dozen deployed\ndown the side corridors toward the engine rooms and control turrets.\nBut as Hake came nearer he tossed back the quartzite headpiece of his\nbulger, and I saw that his hair was wheat-gold, his lips curved into\nsomething like a tender smile, his cheeks smooth, soft, boyish.\n\nHis voice was gentle, too. He said, \"You offer no resistance, Captain?\nThat is wise.\"\n\nCap Hanson said, \"Hake, I surrender my ship to you freely. But do not\nharm my men. That is all I ask. My men do not deserve--\"\n\n\"But, Captain!\" The slender little pirate's eye-brows lifted archly.\n\"Surely you are a little premature in your pleas? We have just arrived.\nThere are so many, many things to be done before we--ah--enjoy our\nlittle pleasures.\"\n\nAnd then, as he said that, I saw why men cursed the name of Runt Hake.\nIt was not in his face. His golden hair, his pink cheeks, his soft\nmouth--all these were but gilding for the rottenness within him. The\nreal Hake was in his eyes. Those dancing, glinting, gloating eyes that\nleaped into swift, flaming delight as he hinted at that which was to\ncome.\n\nHe was a devil. A pint-sized devil, perhaps, but a devil nonetheless.\nI knew, now, that the stories were all true; that we could expect no\nmercy of this man. He would amuse himself with us for a while, toying\nwith us in feline fashion. Then he would leave. And we would stay. Like\nthe broken things I had seen in the Sargossa.\n\nHe was speaking again. Softly, melodiously, as if he were a warrant\nofficer at some cargo port on Earth rather than a midspace pirate\nappraising his \"take\".\n\n\"The cargo, of course, Captain, is mine. Even now my men will be\ntransferring it to my ship beside yours. But there are a few other\nthings we will do while aboard. It is lonely, being in space for\nmonths on end. And we do not dine luxuriously. You have, I suppose,\na well-stocked larder? With fine foods; wines, perhaps, to tempt the\npalate?\"\n\nHanson tried again.\n\n\"We have, Hake. And they are all yours if you'll promise me the men\nwill be unharmed.\" He hesitated. \"Take me along as hostage, if you want\nto. That'll be all right. But--\"\n\n\"But, no, Captain! That would never do. I think you had best\nremain--with your men.\" Again there was that tiny, dancing light in\nHake's eyes. \"You see, many know my name, Captain, and I understand I\nhave a small reputation. But none have ever seen my face--and lived. It\nwould be unfortunate if I were to be identified, would it not?\"\n\nHe turned to his followers.\n\n\"Disarm them,\" he designated us negligently. \"And when the cargo has\nbeen transferred, have our men come in to dine. We will dine aboard the\n_Saturn_.\"\n\n\n\nYou Earthlubbers will think this part strange, maybe? That we showed no\nmore resistance than this to Hake's invasion? Well, I don't blame you.\nI've read _Martian Tales_ and _Spaceways Weekly_, too. The writers for\nthose mags would like you to believe that every freighter captain is\na horny-fisted John Paul Jones. But think it over! The _Saturn_ was a\nlumbering old cow compared to Hake's streamliner. Hanson had adopted\nthe only sane policy. To placate the pirate, be nice to him, hope we\ncould stall off his scuttling plans until the S.S.C.B. cruiser reached\nus.\n\nSo for more than two hours, unarmed and disconsolate, we of the\n_Saturn_ sat around and diddled our fingers while Hake's men, using our\nengine crew, the wipers and blasters, for porters, transferred the more\nvaluable parts of our cargo to their ship. They didn't take the bulk\nstuff. Just small necessities that could be fenced from a hideout on\none of the rogue asteroids.\n\nMeanwhile, Runt Hake had made at least one special trip. Down to the\ngalley. He took Todd and Cap and me along so he could keep an eye on\nus. Down there we found Lancelot Biggs, quietly reading.\n\nHake said in that soft purr of his, \"You--you're the cook on this ship?\"\n\nBiggs answered, \"Mmm-hmm.\"\n\n\"You will address me,\" suggested the little outlaw, \"as 'Sir.' Very\nwell, Slops. I want you to prepare a meal for us. A _good_ meal. Fresh\nmeats and vegetables. You have no idea--\" He drawled this last to\nHanson. \"How one wearies of canned concentrates.\"\n\nHanson just glowered. But Biggs looked confused. He said, \"I--I'll\nhave to get produce from the storage bins if you want a big meal. This\ngalley's small--\" He looked about him helplessly.\n\nHake nodded. \"That is granted. But, mind you, attempt no\nmedieval--ah--toxicological exploits. I remember the chef of the\n_Spica_ tried something of the sort. Poor lad! He screamed horribly ...\nI shall never forget it.\"\n\nI bet he wouldn't! The louse. But I hoped, now, that Biggs would\nunderstand I had been right. He couldn't pull any funny business on\nRunt and get away with it.\n\nHe seemed to understand, all right. He said, goggling, \"I'll do the\nbest I can--sir. It will take a little time, of course.\"\n\n\"We have time and to spare,\" agreed Hake. \"A good meal, that is what we\nwant. And now, gentlemen--?\"\n\nHe motioned us toward the turret room. We started to leave the galley.\nI was the last to pass through the door. As I did so, I felt a fumbling\nat my side. Mr. Biggs was shoving something into my pocket. He\nwhispered in my ear, \"Sparks--give each of our men a piece. Tell them\nto chew it!\"\n\n\n\nFor a moment my hopes flamed high. I didn't know what Biggs had up his\nsleeve, but I dared dream that he had devised some way of overcoming\nthe pirate menace. But when I managed to get away, unobserved, a few\nminutes later to see what he had thrust in my jacket, my hopes died as\nsuddenly as they had been born.\n\nThe stuff was nothing but pepsin. Plain, ordinary pepsin; a by-product\nfrom the outspread Venusian ranches.\n\nI was half minded to chuck the damn stuff away. I thought maybe worry,\ndesperation, had made Biggs slip his gravs. Then I thought better of\nit. After all, he may have had some reason. And in a spot like this,\nany gamble was worth taking....\n\nSo, slowly, I started getting the stuff distributed around. I\nmanaged to slip half the package to Doug Enderby, the steward, with\ninstructions to get it to the black gang. I met Chief Garrity 'tween\ndecks, and gave him some for his engine room crew. Todd took a piece,\nwondering, reluctant, but put it in his mouth when I signalled him to\ndo so. Me? Sure, I had some, too. After all, it tasted good. And a man\nmight as well check out with a clean taste in his mouth.\n\nThe only man I couldn't slip a piece to at any time was Cap Hanson.\nRunt Hake had the old eagle eye on the Skipper. Matter of fact, Hake\nhad the eagle eye on all of us. He didn't miss a trick, that murderous\nlittle squirt. Just before dinner was served he made my heart miss a\nbeat when he asked, \"What are you chewing on, Sparks? Gum?\"\n\nHe gave me the fright and the out at the same time. I nodded. \"Yeah,\" I\nsaid. Then, fearful not to ask, \"You want a piece?\"\n\nHe shuddered delicately. \"Barbarian custom. I do not want a piece.\"\n\nBoy, was that a break for our side!\n\n\n\nSo, like I said, Biggs donged out the dinner call, and we all went\ninto the mess hall. Talk about irony! Here we were, a score of honest,\nhard-working spacemen and an equal number of pirates, sitting down to\nthe same table, eating the same meal.\n\nScrewy? Sure--but that was Hake for you. As Mr. Biggs had said, he\nwas a show-off. But don't think he took any chances. We were unarmed,\nhis men were walking hardware stores. As for the conviviality of that\nbanquet, that was strictly on the stinko! To outward appearances, we\nwere all palsy-walsy at the banquet table; actually we of the _Saturn_\nwere being fattened for the slaughter to follow.\n\nStill--well, you know the old gag. \"The condemned man ate a hearty\nmeal.\" That's what I did, and that's what most of the other fellows\ndid, too. Because Mr. Lancelot Slops had come up with another Q.E.D.\nthat cooking is, after all, nothing but applied chemistry.\n\nWe had, just to make you drool a little, chilled consomm\u00e9 with a light\nsherry. Then a tempting wisp of baked whiting, served with Moselle\nErdener Treppchen, and was the Old Man fuming! (He'd been saving that\nfor his golden anniversary). Then a chicken saut\u00e9 Florentine....\n\nThey were the preludes. The main drag-'em-out was a saddle of lamb\naccompanied by peas in mint, potatoes Parisienne, and served along\nwith Pommard, 1974. The salad was a Salad Alma; the dessert was\nsomething which Biggs told me later was Plombi\u00e8re a l'Havane Friandises\n(pineapples, bananas, frozen custard, and not a damn bit of tapioca in\nit!)\n\nThis came along with the Piper Heidsieck, '65. A demi-tasse was next,\nthen liqueurs--\n\nIt was here that Runt Hake called a halt. \"We'll transfer the\nbeverages,\" he said, \"to our own ship. We want no drunkenness aboard\nwhile we--ah--do that which is now necessary. Captain Hanson?\"\n\nHe nodded significantly toward the turret room. I rose, so did Todd.\nSurprisingly, Biggs joined our group as we moved up deck. Hake said,\nwith a malevolent regretfulness I shall never forget, \"We have enjoyed\nour banquet exceedingly, Captain. But you understand I can allow\nnothing to stand in the way of my next--ah--duty. So--\"\n\nHanson said stonily, \"You will give us a lifeskiff before scuttling the\n_Saturn_, Hake?\"\n\nHake lied, \"Captain, I had planned to do that very thing. But a most\nunfortunate accident ... it seems that some of my men were so careless\nas to blast holes in each of the skiffs. Of course if you'd still like\nto take your chances in the damaged craft--?\"\n\nOh, he was a whipper, that Hake! I looked at Todd and saw the same\nthought mirrored in his eyes that I was thinking. This was our last\nchance. If we didn't get Hake now, it would be too late. I tensed\nmyself. If we could grab the pirate chieftain, maybe his men would not\ndare do anything for fear of hurting him. And Hake, quick as he was on\nthe trigger, might not get us both before--\n\nThen once again Lancelot Biggs intervened. To me he barked, \"No! No,\nSparks!\" And to Hake, quietly, almost tenderly, \"Why, Mr. Hake--it's\nall a big mistake, isn't it? These rough, nasty old men think you want\nto hurt them! And you don't at all. Aren't they the old meanies?\"\n\n\n\nAnd then--hold your hats, folks!--and then Runt Hake's soft mouth began\nto twitch! Yes, twitch! It pursed up like the mouth of a kid, his eyes\nwrinkled, and he began to blubber!\n\n\"Hurt them?\" he complained. \"Me hurt them? Why, I wouldn't do a thing\nlike that! I love them! They're my pals.\" And he tossed his pierce gun\naway, reached out and patted Biggs' cheek!\n\nBeside me I heard Lt. Todd whisper hoarsely, \"Good gods of Greece,\nwhat is this!\" I myself was stunned for a moment. But I had sense\nenough to stoop down and get Runt Hake's gun before this crazy\ninterlude had passed. \"He's blown his fuses!\" I squalled. \"Grab him,\nTodd! Mr. Biggs, come with me! You and I will round up his crew--\"\n\nBut Biggs said quietly, \"Take your time, Sparks. There's no hurry. See?\"\n\nHe stepped to the wall; flicked on the visiplate that showed the\ninterior of the mess hall. And there, where a moment before, a\ngrim-faced score of space pirates had maintained watch over our crew,\nnow our crew were standing staring with blank, uncomprehending faces\nat twenty men who looked and acted for all the world like affectionate\npuppies!\n\nThey were hugging each other, patting each other's arms and faces,\nmurmuring soft words of endearment. It was stupefying. More than\nthat--it was embarrassing! Off in one corner a bearded, one-eyed outlaw\ndandled a companion on his knee. Another burly bruiser, big enough to\ntear a man in half with his bare hands, was playing piggy-back with a\nbuddy!\n\nI gulped and stared and gulped again. I choked, \"But, what--what--\"\n\nBiggs said suddenly, \"Sparks! You didn't give the Skipper a piece of\nthat pepsin!\"\n\n\"I didn't get a chance. But how--\"\n\nThen I saw. The Skipper and Runt Hake were sitting in the same chair,\nmurmuring soft words of tenderness at each other, stroking each other's\nhair fondly. Just as I looked, the Old Man leaned forward and gave the\npirate a big, juicy kiss on the forehead!\n\nAnd just then there came a welcome interruption. The audio throbbed to\nelectric life; a brusque voice rasped, \"Calling the _Saturn! Saturn_,\nahoy! S.S.C.B. Cruiser _Iris_ calling. Stand by! We'll come alongside\nyou in twenty minutes....\"\n\n\n\nAfterward, when Runt Hake and his pirates, still babbling incoherent\nprotestations of endearment, had been removed to the patrol ship and\ntaken back toward the Venusian prison that had long awaited them, we\nheld a confab in my radio room. Todd was there, and Chief Garrity, and\nLancelot Biggs and myself. Also a very foggy-eyed, befuddled Captain\nHanson who seemed to be having a hard time keeping from saying we were\nall \"dear, sweet boys\"--as he had told us quite a few times in the past\nhour or so.\n\nI couldn't make head or tail of it. So I asked Biggs bluntly, \"But\nwhat was it, Mr. Biggs? We all know it was something you put in the\nfood. Something from which the pepsin saved us. But what? Surely no\ndrug would make a man act like that.\"\n\nBiggs grinned, his Adam's-apple jerking amiably.\n\n\"No, not a drug. But a chemical. Prolactin, to be exact. If you'll\nremember, I started to tell you we were carrying a load of it to earth.\"\n\n\"Prolactin?\" said Todd. \"What's that?\"\n\n\"An extract of the pituitary gland; the hormone that governs human\naffections. Prolactin is the hormone that is responsible for all\nacts of parental love. It causes roosters to brood and set on eggs,\ntomcats to give milk and milk-deficient females to become normal. It is\ncommonly known as the 'mother-love' crystal.\"\n\n\"And we,\" I said, \"were carrying a load of it. I still don't\nunderstand, though, why we had to chew the pepsin. And why it failed to\nturn all of us into bunny-huggers like--\"\n\nI glanced at the Old Man, then glanced away again. He looked at me\nfondly.\n\n\"Well, you see,\" explained Biggs, \"prolactin happens to be a pure\nprotein. And pure proteins are insoluble in most things, alcohol,\nwater, anything you might normally take in your diet.\n\n\"I cooked Hake's banquet, and his goose, with liberal sprinklings\nof prolactin. But, as you had previously pointed out, I had to find\nsome way of keeping _our_ men from being affected by the hormone that\ndisrupted their morale. Pepsin was the answer. Pepsin breaks down pure\nproteids into soluble peptones. That is why it is commonly used as a\ndigestive agent.\"\n\n\"Drwstbynlvy--\" mumbled the Skipper soothingly.\n\n\"Eh?\" I demanded, \"What's that?\"\n\nBiggs looked embarrassed. \"I'm not sure,\" he said, \"but I think\nhe's saying, 'You're a dear sweet baby and I love you very much!'\nEr--Sparks--I think maybe we'd better put him to bed until it wears\noff....\"\n\nSo that was that. And maybe I shouldn't have told you all this; I don't\nknow. Because the Skipper, recovered now from his spell of \"maternal\naffection\" is rather sensitive on the subject. And I'm still clicking\nthe bug on the _Saturn_.\n\nAnyhow, now you know. But if you ever tell Cap Hanson I told you, it's\ngoing to be just too bad for me. I may have to catch the next express\nfor Pluto and points west. Me and Biggs both. There's not much \"mother\nlove\" in Cap Hanson's right cross!\n\n\n",
