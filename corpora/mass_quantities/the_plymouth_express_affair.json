    "body": "Alec Simpson, R. N., stepped from the platform at Newton Abbot into a\nfirst-class compartment of the Plymouth Express. A porter followed him\nwith a heavy suitcase. He was about to swing it up to the rack, but\nthe young sailor stopped him.\n\n\u201cNo\u2014leave it on the seat. I\u2019ll put it up later. Here you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d The porter, generously tipped, withdrew.\n\nDoors banged; a stentorian voice shouted: \u201cPlymouth only. Change for\nTorquay. Plymouth next stop.\u201d Then a whistle blew, and the train drew\nslowly out of the station.\n\nLieutenant Simpson had the carriage to himself. The December air was\nchilly, and he pulled up the window. Then he sniffed vaguely, and\nfrowned. What a smell there was! Reminded him of that time in\nhospital, and the operation on his leg. Yes, chloroform; that was it!\n\nHe let the window down again, changing his seat to one with its back\nto the engine. He pulled a pipe out of his pocket and lit it. For a\nlittle time he sat inactive, looking out into the night and smoking.\n\nAt last he roused himself, and opening the suitcase, took out some\npapers and magazines, then closed the suitcase again and endeavored to\nshove it under the opposite seat\u2014without success. Some hidden obstacle\nresisted it. He shoved harder with rising impatience, but it still\nstuck out halfway into the carriage.\n\n\u201cWhy the devil wont it go in?\u201d he muttered, and hauling it out\ncompletely, he stooped down and peered under the seat....\n\nA moment later a cry rang out into the night, and the great train came\nto an unwilling halt in obedience to the imperative jerking of the\ncommunication-cord.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201cMon ami,\u201d said Poirot. \u201cYou have, I know, been deeply interested in\nthis mystery of the Plymouth Express. Read this.\u201d\n\nI picked up the note he flicked across the table to me. It was brief\nand to the point.\n\n    Dear Sir:\n\n    I shall be obliged if you will call upon me at your\n    earliest convenience.\n\n                                Yours faithfully,\n                                      Ebenezer Halliday.\n\nThe connection was not clear to my mind, and I looked inquiringly at\nPoirot. For answer he took up the newspaper and read aloud:\n\n\u201c\u2018A sensational discovery was made last night. A young naval officer\nreturning to Plymouth found under the seat of his compartment, the\nbody of a woman, stabbed through the heart. The officer at once pulled\nthe communication-cord, and the train was brought to a standstill. The\nwoman who was about thirty years of age, and richly dressed, has not\nyet been identified.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd later we have this: \u2018The woman found dead in the Plymouth Express\nhas been identified as the Honorable Mrs. Rupert Carrington.\u2019 You see\nnow, my friend? Or if you do not, I will add this. Mrs. Rupert\nCarrington was, before her marriage, Flossie Halliday, daughter of old\nman Halliday, the steel king of America.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he has sent for you? Splendid!\u201d\n\n\u201cI did him a little service in the past\u2014an affair of bearer bonds. And\nonce, when I was in Paris for a royal visit, I had Mademoiselle\nFlossie pointed out to me. _La jolie petite pensionnaire!_ She had the\n_jolie dot_ too! It caused trouble. She nearly made a bad affair.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow was that?\u201d\n\n\u201cA certain Count de la Rochefour. _Un bien mauvais sujet!_ A bad hat,\nas you would say. An adventurer pure and simple, who knew how to\nappeal to a romantic young girl. Luckily her father got wind of it in\ntime. He took her back to America in haste. I heard of her marriage\nsome years later, but I know nothing of her husband.\u201d\n\n\u201cH\u2019m,\u201d I said. \u201cThe Honorable Rupert Carrington is no beauty, by all\naccounts. He\u2019d pretty well run through his own money on the turf, and\nI should imagine old man Halliday\u2019s dollars came along in the nick of\ntime. I should say that for a good-looking, well-mannered, utterly\nunscrupulous young scoundrel, it would be hard to find his match!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, the poor little lady! _Elle n\u2019est pas bien tomb\u00e9e!_\u201d\n\n\u201cI fancy he made it pretty obvious at once that it was her money, and\nnot she, that had attracted him. I believe they drifted apart almost\nat once. I have heard rumors lately that there was to be a definite\nlegal separation.\u201d\n\n\u201cOld man Halliday is no fool. He would tie up her money pretty tight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI dare say. Anyway, I know as a fact that the Honorable Rupert is\nsaid to be extremely hard up.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh-ha! I wonder\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wonder what?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy good friend, do not jump down my throat like that. You are\ninterested, I see. Supposing you accompany me to see Mr. Halliday.\nThere is a taxi stand at the corner.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nA very few minutes sufficed to whirl us to the superb house in Park\nLane rented by the American magnate. We were shown into the library,\nand almost immediately we were joined by a large, stout man, with\npiercing eyes and an aggressive chin.\n\n\u201cM. Poirot?\u201d said Mr. Halliday. \u201cI guess I don\u2019t need to tell you what\nI want you for. You\u2019ve read the papers, and I\u2019m never one to let the\ngrass grow under my feet. I happened to hear you were in London, and I\nremembered the good work you did over those bonds. Never forget a\nname. I\u2019ve got the pick of Scotland Yard, but I\u2019ll have my own man as\nwell. Money no object. All the dollars were made for my little\ngirl\u2014and now she\u2019s gone, I\u2019ll spend my last cent to catch the damned\nscoundrel that did it! See? So it\u2019s up to you to deliver the goods.\u201d\n\nPoirot bowed.\n\n\u201cI accept, monsieur, all the more willingly that I saw your daughter\nin Paris several times. And now I will ask you to tell me the\ncircumstances of her journey to Plymouth and any other details that\nseem to you to bear upon the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, to begin with,\u201d responded Halliday, \u201cshe wasn\u2019t going to\nPlymouth. She was going to join a house-party at Avonmead Court, the\nDuchess of Swansea\u2019s place. She left London by the twelve-fourteen\nfrom Paddington, arriving at Bristol (where she had to change) at\ntwo-fifty. The principal Plymouth expresses, of course, run via\nWestbury, and do not go near Bristol at all. The twelve-fourteen does\na nonstop run to Bristol, afterward stopping at Weston, Taunton,\nExeter and Newton Abbot. My daughter traveled alone in her carriage,\nwhich was reserved as far as Bristol, her maid being in a third-class\ncarriage in the next coach.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nPoirot nodded, and Mr. Halliday went on: \u201cThe party at Avonmead Court\nwas to be a very gay one, with several balls, and in consequence my\ndaughter had with her nearly all her jewels\u2014amounting in value\nperhaps, to about a hundred thousand dollars.\u201d\n\n\u201c_Un moment_,\u201d interrupted Poirot. \u201cWho had charge of the jewels? Your\ndaughter, or the maid?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy daughter always took charge of them herself, carrying them in a\nsmall blue morocco case.\u201d\n\n\u201cContinue, monsieur.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt Bristol the maid, Jane Mason, collected her mistress\u2019 dressing-bag\nand wraps, which were with her, and came to the door of Flossie\u2019s\ncompartment. To her intense surprise, my daughter told her that she\nwas not getting out at Bristol, but was going on farther. She directed\nMason to get out the luggage and put it in the cloak-room. She could\nhave tea in the refreshment-room, but she was to wait at the station\nfor her mistress, who would return to Bristol by an up-train in the\ncourse of the afternoon. The maid, although very much astonished, did\nas she was told. She put the luggage in the cloak-room and had some\ntea. But up-train after up-train came in, and her mistress did not\nappear. After the arrival of the last train, she left the luggage\nwhere it was, and went to a hotel near the station for the night. This\nmorning she read of the tragedy, and returned to town by the first\navailable train.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there nothing to account for your daughter\u2019s sudden change of\nplan?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, there is this: According to Jane Mason, at Bristol, Flossie was\nno longer alone in her carriage. There was a man in it who stood\nlooking out of the farther window so that she could not see his face.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe train was a corridor one, of course?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich side was the corridor?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the platform side. My daughter was standing in the corridor as she\ntalked to Mason.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd there is no doubt in your mind\u2014excuse me!\u201d He got up, and\ncarefully straightened the inkstand which was a little askew. \u201c_Je\nvous demande pardon_,\u201d he continued, reseating himself. \u201cIt affects my\nnerves to see anything crooked. Strange, is it not? I was saying,\nmonsieur, that there is no doubt in your mind, as to this probably\nunexpected meeting being the cause of your daughter\u2019s sudden change of\nplan?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems the only reasonable supposition.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have no idea as to who the gentleman in question might be?\u201d\n\nThe millionaire hesitated for a moment, and then replied.\n\n\u201cNo\u2014I do not know at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow\u2014as to the discovery of the body?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was discovered by a young naval officer who at once gave the\nalarm. There was a doctor on the train. He examined the body. She had\nbeen first chloroformed, and then stabbed. He gave it as his opinion\nthat she had been dead about four hours, so it must have been done not\nlong after leaving Bristol. \u2014Probably between there and Weston,\npossibly between Weston and Taunton.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the jewel-case.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe jewel-case, M. Poirot, was missing.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing more, monsieur. Your daughter\u2019s fortune\u2014to whom does it\npass at her death?\u201d\n\n\u201cFlossie made a will soon after her marriage, leaving everything to\nher husband.\u201d He hesitated for a minute, and then went on: \u201cI may as\nwell tell you, Monsieur Poirot, that I regard my son-in-law as an\nunprincipled scoundrel, and that, by my advice, my daughter was on the\neve of freeing herself from him by legal means\u2014no difficult matter. I\nsettled her money upon her in such a way that he could not touch it\nduring her lifetime, but although they have lived entirely apart for\nsome years, she has frequently acceded to his demands for money,\nrather than face an open scandal. However, I was determined to put an\nend to this, and at last Flossie agreed, and my lawyers were\ninstructed to take proceedings.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd where is Monsieur Carrington?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn town. I believe he was away in the country yesterday, but he\nreturned last night.\u201d\n\nPoirot considered a little while. Then he said: \u201cI think that is all,\nmonsieur.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would like to see the maid, Jane Mason?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you please.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nHalliday rang the bell, and gave a short order to the footman. A few\nminutes later Jane Mason entered the room, a respectable,\nhard-featured woman, as emotionless in the face of tragedy as only a\ngood servant can be.\n\n\u201cYou will permit me to put a few questions? Your mistress, she was\nquite as usual before starting yesterday morning? Not excited or\nflurried?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no sir!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut at Bristol she was quite different?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes sir, regular upset\u2014so nervous she didn\u2019t seem to know what she\nwas saying.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did she say exactly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell sir, as near as I can remember, she said: \u2018Mason, I\u2019ve got to\nalter my plans. Something has happened\u2014I mean, I\u2019m not getting out\nhere after all. I must go on. Get out the luggage and put it in the\ncloak-room; then have some tea, and wait for me in the station.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Wait for you here, ma\u2019am?\u2019 I asked.\n\n\u201c\u2018Yes, yes. Don\u2019t leave the station. I shall return by a later train.\nI don\u2019t know when. It mayn\u2019t be until quite late.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Very well, ma\u2019am,\u2019 I says. It wasn\u2019t my place to ask questions, but\nI thought it very strange.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was unlike your mistress, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery unlike her, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell sir, I thought it was to do with the gentleman in the carriage.\nShe didn\u2019t speak to him, but she turned round once or twice as though\nto ask him if she was doing right.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t see the gentleman\u2019s face?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo sir; he stood with his back to me all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you describe him at all?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had on a light fawn overcoat, and a traveling cap. He was tall and\nslender, like, and the back of his head was dark.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t know him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no, I don\u2019t think so, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was not your master, Mr. Carrington, by any chance?\u201d\n\nMason looked rather startled.\n\n\u201cOh! I don\u2019t think so, sir!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you are not _sure_?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was about the master\u2019s build, sir\u2014but I never thought of it being\nhim. We so seldom saw him. I couldn\u2019t say it _wasn\u2019t_ him!\u201d\n\nPoirot picked up a pin from the carpet, and frowned at it severely;\nthen he continued: \u201cWould it be possible for the man to have entered\nthe train at Bristol before you reached the carriage?\u201d\n\nMason considered.\n\n\u201cYes sir, I think it would. My compartment was very crowded, and it\nwas some minutes before I could get out\u2014and then there was a very\nlarge crowd on the platform, and that delayed me too. But he\u2019d only\nhave had a minute or two to speak to the mistress, that way. I took it\nfor granted that he\u2019d come along the corridor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is more probable, certainly.\u201d\n\nHe paused, still frowning.\n\n\u201cYou know how the mistress was dressed, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe papers give a few details, but I would like you to confirm them.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was wearing a white fox fur toque, sir, with a white spotted\nveil, and a blue frieze coat and skirt\u2014the shade of blue they call\nelectric.\u201d\n\n\u201cH\u2019m, rather striking.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d remarked Halliday. \u201cInspector Japp is in hopes that that may\nhelp us to fix the spot where the crime took place. Anyone who saw her\nwould remember her.\u201d\n\n\u201c_Pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment!_ \u2014Thank you, mademoiselle.\u201d The maid left the room.\n\n\u201cWell!\u201d Poirot got up briskly. \u201cThat is all I can do here\u2014except,\nmonsieur, that I would ask you to tell me everything\u2014but\n_everything_!\u201d\n\n\u201cI have done so.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen there is nothing more to be said. I must decline the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you have not been frank with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI assure you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you are keeping something back.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a moment\u2019s pause, and then Halliday drew a paper from his\npocket and handed it to my friend.\n\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s what you\u2019re after, Monsieur Poirot\u2014though how you know\nabout it fairly gets my goat!\u201d\n\nPoirot smiled, and unfolded the paper. It was a letter written in thin\nsloping handwriting. Poirot read it aloud.\n\n    \u201c\u2018Ch\u00e8re Madame:\n\n    \u201c\u2018It is with infinite pleasure that I look forward to the\n    felicity of meeting you again. After your so amiable reply to\n    my letter, I can hardly restrain my impatience. I have never\n    forgotten those days in Paris. It is most cruel that you\n    should be leaving London tomorrow. However, before very long,\n    and perhaps sooner than you think, I shall have the joy of\n    beholding once more the lady whose image has ever reigned\n    supreme in my heart.\n\n    \u201c\u2018Believe, ch\u00e8re madame, all the assurances of my most devoted\n    and unaltered sentiments\u2014\n\n                                        \u201c\u2018Armand de la Rochefour.\u2019\u201d\n\nPoirot handed the letter back to Halliday with a bow.\n\n\u201cI fancy, monsieur, that you did not know that your daughter intended\nrenewing her acquaintance with the Count de la Rochefour?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt came as a thunderbolt to me! I found this letter in my daughter\u2019s\nhandbag. As you probably know, Monsieur Poirot, this so-called count\nis an adventurer of the worst type.\u201d\n\nPoirot nodded.\n\n\u201cBut what I want to know is how you knew of the existence of this\nletter?\u201d\n\nMy friend smiled. \u201cMonsieur, I did not. But to track footmarks, and\nrecognize cigarette-ash is not sufficient for a detective. He must\nalso be a good psychologist! I knew that you disliked and mistrusted\nyour son-in-law. He benefits by your daughter\u2019s death; the maid\u2019s\ndescription of the mysterious man bears a sufficient resemblance to\nhim. Yet you are not keen on his track! Why? Surely because your\nsuspicions lie in another direction. Therefore you were keeping\nsomething back.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, Monsieur Poirot. I was sure of Rupert\u2019s guilt until I\nfound this letter. It unsettled me horribly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. The Count says: \u2018Before very long, and perhaps sooner than you\nthink.\u2019 Obviously he would not want to wait until you should get wind\nof his reappearance. Was it he who traveled down from London by the\ntwelve-fourteen, and came along the corridor to your daughter\u2019s\ncompartment? The Count de la Rochefour is also, if I remember rightly,\ntall and dark!\u201d\n\nThe millionaire nodded.\n\n\u201cWell, monsieur, I will wish you good day. Scotland Yard, has, I\npresume, a list of the jewels?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I believe Inspector Japp is here now if you would like to see\nhim.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nJapp was an old friend of ours, and greeted Poirot with a sort of\naffectionate contempt.\n\n\u201cAnd how are you, monsieur? No bad feeling between us, though we\n_have_ got our different ways of looking at things. How are the\n\u2018little gray cells,\u2019 eh? Going strong?\u201d\n\nPoirot beamed upon him. \u201cThey function, my good Japp; assuredly they\ndo!\u201d\n\n\u201cThen that\u2019s all right. Think it was the Honorable Rupert, or a crook?\nWe\u2019re keeping an eye on all the regular places, of course. We shall\nknow if the shiners are disposed of, and of course whoever did it\nisn\u2019t going to keep them to admire their sparkle. Not likely! I\u2019m\ntrying to find out where Rupert Carrington was yesterday. Seems a bit\nof a mystery about it. I\u2019ve got a man watching him.\u201d\n\n\u201cA great precaution, but perhaps a day late,\u201d suggested Poirot gently.\n\n\u201cYou always will have your joke, Monsieur Poirot. Well, I\u2019m off to\nPaddington. Bristol, Weston, Taunton, that\u2019s my beat. So long.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will come round and see me this evening, and tell me the result?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure thing, if I\u2019m back.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat good Inspector believes in matter in motion,\u201d murmured Poirot as\nour friend departed. \u201cHe travels; he measures footprints; he collects\nmud and cigarette-ash! He is extremely busy! He is zealous beyond\nwords! And if I mentioned psychology to him, do you know what he would\ndo, my friend? He would smile! He would say to himself: \u2018Poor old\nPoirot! He ages! He grows senile!\u2019 Japp is the \u2018younger generation\nknocking on the door.\u2019 And _ma foi!_ They are so busy knocking that\nthey do not notice that the door is open!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what are you going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we have _carte blanche_, I shall expend threepence in ringing up\nthe Ritz\u2014where you may have noticed our Count is staying. After that,\nas my feet are a little damp, and I have sneezed twice, I shall return\nto my rooms and make myself a _tisano_ over the spirit lamp!\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nI did not see Poirot again until the following morning. I found him\nplacidly finishing his breakfast.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d I inquired eagerly. \u201cWhat has happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Japp?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have not seen him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Count?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe left the Ritz the day before yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe day of the murder?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen that settles it! Rupert Carrington is cleared.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause the Count de la Rochefour has left the Ritz? You go too fast,\nmy friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyway, he must be followed, arrested! But what could be his motive?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne hundred thousand dollars\u2019 worth of jewelry is a very good motive\nfor anyone. No, the question to my mind is: why kill her? Why not\nsimply steal the jewels? She would not prosecute.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause she is a woman, _mon ami_. She once loved this man. Therefore\nshe would suffer her loss in silence. And the Count, who is an\nextremely good psychologist where women are concerned,\u2014hence his\nsuccesses,\u2014would know that perfectly well! On the other hand, if\nRupert Carrington killed her, why take the jewels, which would\nincriminate him fatally?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a blind.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps you are right, my friend. Ah, here is Japp! I recognize his\nknock.\u201d\n\nThe Inspector was beaming good-humoredly.\n\n\u201cMorning, Poirot. Only just got back. I\u2019ve done some good work! And\nyou?\u201d\n\n\u201cMe, I have arranged my ideas,\u201d replied Poirot placidly.\n\nJapp laughed heartily.\n\n\u201cOld chap\u2019s getting on in years,\u201d he observed beneath his breath to\nme. \u201cThat wont do for us young folk,\u201d he said aloud.\n\n\u201c_Quel dommage?_\u201d Poirot inquired.\n\n\u201cWell, do you want to hear what I\u2019ve done?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou permit me to make a guess? You have found the knife with which\nthe crime was committed by the side of the line between Weston and\nTaunton, and you have interviewed the paper-boy who spoke to Mrs.\nCarrington at Weston!\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nJapp\u2019s jaw fell. \u201cHow on earth did you know? Don\u2019t tell me it was\nthose almighty \u2018little gray cells\u2019 of yours!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am glad you admit for once that they are _all mighty_! Tell me, did\nshe give the paper-boy a shilling for himself?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it was half a crown!\u201d Japp recovered his temper and grinned.\n\u201cPretty extravagant, these rich Americans!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd in consequence the boy did not forget her?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot he. Half-crowns don\u2019t come his way every day. She hailed him and\nbought two magazines. One had a picture of a girl in blue on the\ncover. \u2018That\u2019ll match me,\u2019 she said. Oh! he remembered her perfectly.\nWell, that was enough for me. By the doctor\u2019s evidence, the crime\n_must_ have been committed before Taunton. I guessed they\u2019d throw the\nknife away at once, and I walked down the line looking for it; and\nsure enough, there it was. I made inquiries at Taunton about our man,\nbut of course it\u2019s a big station, and it wasn\u2019t likely they\u2019d notice\nhim. He probably got back to London by a later train.\u201d\n\nPoirot nodded. \u201cVery likely.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I found another bit of news when I got back. They\u2019re passing the\njewels, all right! That large emerald was pawned last night\u2014by one of\nthe regular lot. Who do you think it was?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014except that he was a short man.\u201d\n\nJapp stared. \u201cWell, you\u2019re right there. He\u2019s short enough. It was Red\nNarky.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho on earth is Red Narky?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cA particularly sharp jewel-thief, sir. And not one to stick at\nmurder. Usually works with a woman\u2014Gracie Kidd; but she doesn\u2019t seem\nto be in it this time\u2014unless she\u2019s got off to Holland with the rest of\nthe swag.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve arrested Narky?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure thing. But mind you, it\u2019s the other man we want\u2014the man who went\ndown with Mrs. Carrington in the train. He was the one who planned the\njob, right enough. But Narky wont squeal on a pal.\u201d\n\nI noticed that Poirot\u2019s eyes had become very green.\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d he said gently, \u201cthat I can find Narky\u2019s pal for you, all\nright.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of your little ideas, eh?\u201d Japp eyed Poirot sharply. \u201cWonderful\nhow you manage to deliver the goods sometimes, at your age and all.\nDevil\u2019s own luck, of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps, perhaps,\u201d murmured my friend. \u201cHastings, my hat. And the\nbrush. So! My galoshes if it still rains! We must not undo the good\nwork of that _tisano_. Au revoir, Japp!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood luck to you, Poirot.\u201d\n\nPoirot hailed the first taxi we met, and directed the driver to Park\nLane.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen we drew up before Halliday\u2019s house, he skipped out nimbly, paid\nthe driver and rang the bell. To the footman who opened the door he\nmade a request in a low voice, and we were immediately taken upstairs.\nWe went up to the top of the house, and were shown into a small neat\nbedroom.\n\nPoirot\u2019s eyes roved round the room and fastened themselves on a small\nblack trunk. He knelt in front of it, scrutinized the labels on it,\nand took a small twist of wire from his pocket.\n\n\u201cAsk Mr. Halliday if he will be so kind as to mount to me here,\u201d he\nsaid over his shoulder to the footman.\n\n(It is suggested that the reader pause in his perusal of the story at\nthis point, make his own solution of the mystery\u2014and then see how\nclose he comes to that of the author.\u2014The Editors.)\n\nThe man departed, and Poirot gently coaxed the lock of the trunk with\na practiced hand. In a few minutes the lock gave, and he raised the\nlid of the trunk. Swiftly he began rummaging among the clothes it\ncontained, flinging them out on the floor.\n\nThere was a heavy step on the stairs, and Halliday entered the room.\n\n\u201cWhat in hell are you doing here?\u201d he demanded, staring.\n\n\u201cI was looking, monsieur, for _this_.\u201d Poirot withdrew from the trunk\na coat and skirt of bright blue frieze, and a small toque of white fox\nfur.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing with my trunk?\u201d I turned to see that the maid,\nJane Mason, had just entered the room.\n\n\u201cIf you will just shut the door, Hastings. Thank you. Yes, and stand\nwith your back against it. Now, Mr. Halliday, let me introduce you to\nGrace Kidd, otherwise Jane Mason, who will shortly rejoin her\naccomplice, Red Narky, under the kind escort of Japp.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201cIt was of the most simple.\u201d Poirot waved a deprecating hand, then\nhelped himself to more caviare. It is not every day that one lunches\nwith a millionaire.\n\n\u201cIt was the maid\u2019s insistence on the clothes that her mistress was\nwearing that first struck me. Why was she so anxious that our\nattention should be directed to them? I reflected that we had only the\nmaid\u2019s word for the mysterious man in the carriage at Bristol. As far\nas the doctor\u2019s evidence went, Mrs. Carrington might easily have been\nmurdered _before_ reaching Bristol. But if so, then the maid must be\nan accomplice. And if she were an accomplice, she would not wish this\npoint to rest on her evidence alone. The clothes Mrs. Carrington was\nwearing were of a striking nature. A maid usually has a good deal of\nchoice as to what her mistress shall wear. Now if, after Bristol,\nanyone saw a lady in a bright blue coat and skirt, and a fur toque, he\nwill be quite ready to swear he has seen Mrs. Carrington.\n\n\u201cI began to reconstruct. The maid would provide herself with duplicate\nclothes. She and her accomplice chloroform and stab Mrs. Carrington\nbetween London and Bristol, probably taking advantage of a tunnel. Her\nbody is rolled under the seat; the maid takes her place. At Weston she\nmust make herself noticed. How? In all probability, a newspaper-boy\nwill be selected. She will insure his remembering her by giving him a\nlarge tip. She also drew his attention to the color of her dress by a\nremark about one of the magazines. After leaving Weston, she throws\nthe knife out of the window to mark the place where the crime\npresumably occurred, and changes her clothes, or buttons a long\nmackintosh over them. At Taunton she leaves the train and returns to\nBristol as soon as possible, where her accomplice has duly left the\nluggage in the cloak-room. He hands over the ticket and himself\nreturns to London. She waits on the platform, carrying out her r\u00f4le,\ngoes to a hotel for the night and returns to town in the morning\nexactly as she said.\n\n\u201cWhen Japp returned from his expedition, he confirmed all my\ndeductions. He also told me that a well-known crook was passing the\njewels. I knew that whoever it was would be the exact opposite of the\nman Jane Mason described. When I heard that it was Red Narky, who\nalways worked with Gracie Kidd\u2014well, I knew just where to find her.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the Count?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe more I thought of it, the more I was convinced that he had\nnothing to do with it. That gentleman is much too careful of his own\nskin to risk murder. It would be out of keeping with his character.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Monsieur Poirot,\u201d said Halliday. \u201cI owe you a big debt. And the\ncheck I write after lunch wont go near to settling it.\u201d\n\nPoirot smiled modestly, and murmured to me: \u201cThe good Japp, he shall\nget the official credit, all right, but though he has got his Gracie\nKidd, I think that I, as the Americans say, have got his goat!\u201d",
