  "body": "THE house of Heine Brothers, in Munich, was of good repute at the time of\nwhich I am about to tell,—a time not long ago; and is so still, I trust.\nIt was of good repute in its own way, seeing that no man doubted the word\nor solvency of Heine Brothers; but they did not possess, as bankers, what\nwould in England be considered a large or profitable business.  The\noperations of English bankers are bewildering in their magnitude.\nLegions of clerks are employed.  The senior book-keepers, though only\nsalaried servants, are themselves great men; while the real partners are\ninscrutable, mysterious, opulent beyond measure, and altogether unknown\nto their customers.  Take any firm at random,—Brown, Jones, and Cox, let\nus say,—the probability is that Jones has been dead these fifty years,\nthat Brown is a Cabinet Minister, and that Cox is master of a pack of\nhounds in Leicestershire.  But it was by no means so with the house of\nHeine Brothers, of Munich.  There they were, the two elderly men, daily\nto be seen at their dingy office in the Schrannen Platz; and if any\nbusiness was to be transacted requiring the interchange of more than a\nword or two, it was the younger brother with whom the customer was, as a\nmatter of course, brought into contact.  There were three clerks in the\nestablishment; an old man, namely, who sat with the elder brother and had\nno personal dealings with the public; a young Englishman, of whom we\nshall anon hear more; and a boy who ran messages, put the wood on to the\nstoves, and swept out the bank.  Truly he house of Heine Brothers was of\nno great importance; but nevertheless it was of good repute.\n\nThe office, I have said, was in the Schrannen Platz, or old Market-place.\nMunich, as every one knows, is chiefly to be noted as a new town,—so new\nthat many of the streets and most of the palaces look as though they had\nbeen sent home last night from the builders, and had only just been taken\nout of their bandboxes It is angular, methodical, unfinished, and\npalatial.  But there is an old town; and, though the old town be not of\nsurpassing interest, it is as dingy, crooked, intricate, and dark as\nother old towns in Germany.  Here, in the old Market-place, up one long\nbroad staircase, were situated the two rooms in which was held the bank\nof Heine Brothers.\n\nOf the elder member of the firm we shall have something to say before\nthis story be completed.  He was an old bachelor, and was possessed of a\nbachelor’s dwelling somewhere out in the suburbs of the city.  The junior\nbrother was a married man, with a wife some twenty years younger than\nhimself, with two daughters, the elder of whom was now one-and-twenty,\nand one son.  His name was Ernest Heine, whereas the senior brother was\nknown as Uncle Hatto.  Ernest Heine and his wife inhabited a portion of\none of those new palatial residences at the further end of the Ludwigs\nStrasse; but not because they thus lived must it be considered that they\nwere palatial people.  By no means let it be so thought, as such an idea\nwould altogether militate against whatever truth of character painting\nthere may be in this tale.  They were not palatial people, but the very\nreverse, living in homely guise, pursuing homely duties, and satisfied\nwith homely pleasures.  Up two pairs of stairs, however, in that street\nof palaces, they lived, having there a commodious suite of large rooms,\nfurnished, after the manner of the Germans, somewhat gaudily as regarded\ntheir best salon, and with somewhat meagre comfort as regarded their\nother rooms.  But, whether in respect of that which was meagre, or\nwhether in respect of that which was gaudy, they were as well off as\ntheir neighbours; and this, as I take it, is the point of excellence\nwhich is desirable.\n\nErnest Heine was at this time over sixty; his wife was past forty; and\nhis eldest daughter, as I have said, was twenty-one years of age.  His\nsecond child, also a girl, was six years younger; and their third child,\na boy, had not been born till another similar interval had elapsed.  He\nwas named Hatto after his uncle, and the two girls had been christened\nIsa and Agnes.  Such, in number and mode of life, was the family of the\nHeines.\n\nWe English folk are apt to imagine that we are nearer akin to Germans\nthan to our other continental neighbours.  This may be so in blood, but,\nnevertheless, the difference in manners is so striking, that it could\nhardly be enhanced.  An Englishman moving himself off to a city in the\nmiddle of Central America will find the customs to which he must adapt\nhimself less strange to him there, than he would in many a German town.\nBut in no degree of life is the difference more remarkable than among\nunmarried but marriageable young women.  It is not my purpose at the\npresent moment to attribute a superiority in this matter to either\nnationality.  Each has its own charm, its own excellence, its own\nHeaven-given grace, whereby men are led up to purer thoughts and sweet\ndesires; and each may possibly have its own defect.  I will not here\ndescribe the excellence or defect of either; but will, if it be in my\npower, say a word as to this difference.  The German girl of\none-and-twenty,—our Isa’s age,—is more sedate, more womanly, more\nmeditative than her English sister.  The world’s work is more in her\nthoughts, and the world’s amusements less so.  She probably knows less of\nthose things which women learn than the English girl, but that which she\ndoes know is nearer to her hand for use.  She is not so much accustomed\nto society, but nevertheless she is more mistress of her own manner.  She\nis not taught to think so much of those things which flurry and disturb\nthe mind, and therefore she is seldom flurried and disturbed.  To both of\nthem, love,—the idea of love,—must be the thought of all the most\nabsorbing; for is it not fated for them that the joys and sorrows of\ntheir future life must depend upon it?  But the idea of the German girl\nis the more realistic, and the less romantic.  Poetry and fiction she may\nhave read, though of the latter sparingly; but they will not have imbued\nher with that hope for some transcendental paradise of affection which so\noften fills and exalts the hearts of our daughters here at home.  She is\nmoderate in her aspirations, requiring less excitement than an English\ngirl; and never forgetting the solid necessities of life,—as they are so\noften forgotten here in England.  In associating with young men, an\nEnglish girl will always remember that in each one she so meets she may\nfind an admirer whom she may possibly love, or an admirer whom she may\nprobably be called on to repel.  She is ever conscious of the fact of\nthis position; and a romance is thus engendered which, if it may at times\nbe dangerous, is at any rate always charming.  But the German girl, in\nher simplicity, has no such consciousness.  As you and I, my reader,\nmight probably become dear friends were we to meet and know each other,\nso may the German girl learn to love the fair-haired youth with whom\nchance has for a time associated her; but to her mind there occurs no\nsuggestive reason why it should be so,—no probability that the youth may\nregard her in such light, because that chance has come to pass.  She can\ntherefore give him her hand without trepidation, and talk with him for\nhalf an hour, when called on to do so, as calmly as she might do with his\nsister.\n\nSuch a one was Isa Heine at the time of which I am writing.  We English,\nin our passion for daily excitement, might call her phlegmatic, but we\nshould call her so unjustly.  Life to her was a serious matter, of which\nthe daily duties and daily wants were sufficient to occupy her thoughts.\nShe was her mother’s companion, the instructress of both her brother and\nher sister, and the charm of her father’s vacant hours.  With such calls\nupon her time, and so many realities around her, her imagination did not\nteach her to look for joys beyond those of her present life and home.\nWhen love and marriage should come to her, as come they probably might,\nshe would endeavour to attune herself to a new happiness and a new sphere\nof duties.  In the meantime she was contented to keep her mother’s\naccounts, and look after her brother and sister up two pair of stairs in\nthe Ludwigs Strasse.  But change would certainly come, we may prophesy;\nfor Isa Heine was a beautiful girl, tall and graceful, comely to the eye,\nand fit in every way to be loved and cherished as the partner of a man’s\nhome.\n\nI have said that an English clerk made a part of that small establishment\nin the dingy banking-office in the Schrannen Platz, and I must say a word\nor two of Herbert Onslow.  In his early career he had not been fortunate.\nHis father, with means sufficiently moderate, and with a family more than\nsufficiently large, had sent him to a public school at which he had been\nvery idle, and then to one of the universities, at which he had run into\ndebt, and had therefore left without a degree.  When this occurred, a\nfamily council of war had been held among the Onslows, and it was decided\nthat Herbert should be sent off to the banking-house of Heines, at\nMunich, there being a cousinship between the families, and some existing\nconnections of business.\n\nIt was, therefore, so settled; and Herbert, willing enough to see the\nworld,—as he considered he should do by going to Munich,—started for his\nGerman home, with injunctions, very tender from his mother, and very\nsolemn from his aggrieved father.  But there was nothing bad at the heart\nabout young Onslow, and if the solemn father had well considered it, he\nmight perhaps have felt that those debts at Cambridge reflected more\nfault on him than on his son.  When Herbert arrived at Munich, his\ncousins, the Heines,—far-away cousins though they were,—behaved kindly to\nhim.  They established him at first in lodgings, where he was boarded\nwith many others, having heard somewhat of his early youth.  But when\nMadame Heine, at the end of twelve months, perceived that he was punctual\nat the bank, and that his allowances, which, though moderate in England,\nwere handsome in Munich, carried him on without debt, she opened her\nmotherly arms and suggested to his mother and to himself, that he should\nlive with them.  In this way he also was domiciled up two pairs of stairs\nin the palatial residence in the Ludwigs Strasse.\n\nBut all this happened long ago.  Isa Heine had been only seventeen when\nher cousin had first come to Munich, and had made acquaintance with him\nrather as a child than as a woman.  And when, as she ripened into\nwomanhood, this young man came more closely among them, it did not strike\nher that the change would affect her more powerfully than it would the\nothers.  Her uncle and father, she knew, had approved of Herbert at the\nbank; and Herbert had shown that he could be steady; therefore he was to\nbe taken into their family, paying his annual subsidy, instead of being\nleft with strangers at the boarding-house.  All this was very simple to\nher.  She assisted in mending his linen, as she did her father’s; she\nvisited his room daily, as she visited all the others; she took notice of\nhis likings and dislikings as touching their table arrangement,—but by no\nmeans such notice as she did of her father’s; and without any flutter,\ninwardly in her imagination or outwardly as regarded the world, she made\nhim one of the family.  So things went on for a year,—nay, so things went\non for two years with her, after Herbert Onslow had come to the Ludwigs\nStrasse.\n\nBut the matter had been regarded in a very different light by Herbert\nhimself.  When the proposition had been made to him, his first idea had\nbeen that so close a connection with, a girl so very pretty would be\ndelightful.  He had blushed as he had given in his adhesion; but Madame\nHeine, when she saw the blush, had attributed it to anything but the true\ncause.  When Isa had asked him as to his wants and wishes, he had blushed\nagain, but she had been as ignorant as her mother.  The father had merely\nstipulated that, as the young Englishman paid for his board, he should\nhave the full value of his money, so that Isa and Agnes gave up their\npretty front room, going into one that was inferior, and Hatto was put to\nsleep in the little closet that had been papa’s own peculiar property.\nBut nobody complained of this, for it was understood that the money was\nof service.\n\nFor the first year Herbert found that nothing especial happened.  He\nalways fancied that he was in love with Isa, and wrote some poetry about\nher.  But the poetry was in English, and Isa could not read it, even had\nhe dared to show it to her.  During the second year he went home to\nEngland for three months, and by confessing a passion to one of his\nsisters, really brought himself to feel one.  He returned to Munich\nresolved to tell Isa that the possibility of his remaining there depended\nupon her acceptance of his heart; but for months he did not find himself\nable to put his resolution in force.  She was so sedate, so womanly, so\nattentive as regarded cousinly friendship, and so cold as regarded\neverything else, that he did not know how to speak to her.  With an\nEnglish girl whom he had met three times at a ball, he might have been\nmuch more able to make progress.  He was alone with Isa frequently, for\nneither father, mother, nor Isa herself objected to such communion; but\nyet things so went between them that he could not take her by the hand\nand tell her that he loved her.  And thus the third year of his life in\nMunich, and the second of his residence in the Ludwigs Strasse, went by\nhim.  So the years went by, and Isa was now past twenty.  To Herbert, in\nhis reveries, it seemed as though life, and the joys of life, were\nslipping away from him.  But no such feeling disturbed any of the Heines.\nLife of course, was slipping away; but then is it not the destiny of man\nthat life should slip away?  Their wants were all satisfied, and for\nthem, that, together with their close family affection, was happiness\nenough.\n\nAt last, however, Herbert so spoke, or so looked, that both Isa and her\nmother saw that his heart was touched.  He still declared to himself that he\nhad made no sign, and that he was an oaf, an ass, a coward, in that he\nhad not done so.  But he had made some sign, and the sign had been read.\nThere was no secret,—no necessity for a secret on the subject between the\nmother and daughter, but yet it was not spoken of all at once.  There was\nsome little increase of caution between them as Herbert’s name was\nmentioned, so that gradually each knew what the other thought; but for\nweeks, that was all.  Then at last the mother spoke out.\n\n“Isa,” she said, “I think that Herbert Onslow is becoming attached to\nyou.”\n\n“He has never said so, mamma.”\n\n“No; I am sure he has not.  Had he done so, you would have told me.\nNevertheless, is it not true?”\n\n“Well, mamma, I cannot say.  It may be so.  Such an idea has occurred to\nme, but I have abandoned it as needless.  If he has anything to say he\nwill say it.”\n\n“And if he were to speak, how should you answer him?”\n\n“I should take time to think.  I do not at all know what means he has for\na separate establishment.”  Then the subject was dropped between them for\nthat time, and Isa, in her communications with her cousin, was somewhat\nmore reserved than she had been.\n\n“Isa, are you in love with Herbert?” Agnes asked her, as they were\ntogether in their room one night.\n\n“In love with him?  No; why should I be in love with him?”\n\n“I think he is in love with you,” said Agnes.\n\n“That is quite another thing,” said Isa, laughing.  “But if so, he has\nnot taken me into his confidence.  Perhaps he has you.”\n\n“Oh no.  He would not do that, I think.  Not but what we are great\nfriends, and I love him dearly.  Would it not be nice for you and him to\nbe betrothed?”\n\n“That depends on many things, my dear.”\n\n“Oh yes, I know.  Perhaps he has not got money enough.  But you could\nlive here, you know, and he has got some money, because he so often rides\non horseback.”  And then the matter was dropped between the two sisters.\n\nHerbert had given English lessons to the two girls, but the lessons had\nbeen found tedious, and had dwindled away.  Isa, nevertheless, had kept\nup her exercises, duly translating German into English, and English into\nGerman; and occasionally she had shown them to her cousin.  Now, however,\nshe altogether gave over such showing of them, but, nevertheless, worked\nat the task with more energy than before.\n\n“Isa,” he said to her one day,—having with some difficulty found her\nalone in the parlour, “Isa, why should not we go on with our English?”\n\n“Because it is troublesome,—to you I mean.”\n\n“Troublesome.  Well; yes; it is troublesome.  Nothing good is to be had\nwithout trouble.  But I should like it if you would not mind.”\n\n“You know how sick you were of it before;—besides, I shall never be able\nto speak it.”\n\n“I shall not get sick of it now, Isa.”\n\n“Oh yes you would;—in two days.”\n\n“And I want you to speak it.  I desire it especially.”\n\n“Why especially?” asked Isa.  And even she, with all her tranquillity of\ndemeanour, could hardly preserve her even tone and quiet look, as she\nasked the necessary question.\n\n“I will tell you why,” said Herbert; and as he spoke, he got up from his\nseat, and took a step or two over towards her, where she was sitting near\nthe window.  Isa, as she saw him, still continued her work, and strove\nhard to give to the stitches all that attention which they required.  “I\nwill tell you why I would wish you to talk my language.  Because I love\nyou, Isa, and would have you for my wife,—if that be possible.”\n\nShe still continued her work, and the stitches, if not quite as perfect\nas usual, sufficed for their purpose.\n\n“That is why I wish it.  Now will you consent to learn from me again?”\n\n“If I did, Herbert, that consent would include another.”\n\n“Yes; certainly it would.  That is what I intend.  And now will you learn\nfrom me again?”\n\n“That is,—you mean to ask, will I marry you?”\n\n“Will you love me?  Can you learn to love me?  Oh, Isa, I have thought of\nthis so long!  But you have seemed so cold that I have not dared to\nspeak.  Isa, can you love me?”  And he sat himself close beside her.  Now\nthat the ice was broken, he was quite prepared to become an ardent\nlover,—if she would allow of such ardour.  But as he sat down she rose.\n\n“I cannot answer such a question on the sudden,” she said.  “Give me till\nto-morrow, Herbert, and then I will make you a reply;” whereupon she left\nhim, and he stood alone in the room, having done the deed on which he had\nbeen meditating for the last two years.  About half an hour afterwards he\nmet her on the stairs as he was going to his chamber.  “May I speak to\nyour father about this,” he said, hardly stopping her as he asked the\nquestion.  “Oh yes; surely,” she answered; and then again they parted.\nTo him this last-accorded permission sounded as though it carried with it\nmore weight than it in truth possessed.  In his own country a reference\nto the lady’s father is taken as indicating a full consent on the lady’s\npart, should the stern paterfamilias raise no objection.  But Isa had no\nsuch meaning.  She had told him that she could not give her answer till\nthe morrow.  If, however, he chose to consult her father on the subject,\nshe had no objection.  It would probably be necessary that she should\ndiscuss the whole matter in family conclave, before she could bring\nherself to give any reply.\n\nOn that night, before he went to bed, he did speak to her father; and Isa\nalso, before she went to rest, spoke to her mother.  It was singular to\nhim that there should appear to be so little privacy on the subject; that\nthere should be held to be so little necessity for a secret.  Had he made\na suggestion that an extra room should be allotted to him at so much per\nannum, the proposition could not have been discussed with simpler ease.\nAt last, after a three days’ debate, the matter ended thus,—with by no\nmeans a sufficiency of romance for his taste.  Isa had agreed to become\nhis betrothed if certain pecuniary conditions should or could be\nfulfilled.  It appeared now that Herbert’s father had promised that some\nsmall modicum of capital should be forthcoming after a term of years, and\nthat Heine Brothers had agreed that the Englishman should have a\nproportionate share in the bank when that promise should be brought to\nbear.  Let it not be supposed that Herbert would thus become a\nmillionaire.  If all went well, the best would be that some three hundred\na year would accrue to him from the bank, instead of the quarter of that\nincome which he at present received.  But three hundred a year goes a\nlong way at Munich, and Isa’s parents were willing that she should be\nHerbert’s wife if such an income should be forthcoming.\n\nBut even of this there was much doubt.  Application to Herbert’s father\ncould not be judiciously made for some months.  The earliest period at\nwhich, in accordance with old Hatto Heine’s agreement, young Onslow might\nbe admitted to the bank, was still distant by four years; and the present\nmoment was thought to be inopportune for applying to him for any act of\ngrace.  Let them wait, said papa and mamma Heine,—at any rate till New\nYear’s Day, then ten months distant.  Isa quietly said that she would\nwait till New Year’s Day.  Herbert fretted, fumed, and declared that he\nwas ill-treated.  But in the end he also agreed to wait.  What else could\nhe do?\n\n“But we shall see each other daily, and be close to each other,” he said\nto Isa, looking tenderly into her eyes.  “Yes,” she replied, “we shall\nsee each other daily—of course.  But, Herbert—”\n\nHerbert looked up at her and paused for her to go on.\n\n“I have promised mamma that there shall be no change between us,—in our\nmanner to each other, I mean.  We are not betrothed as yet, you know, and\nperhaps we may never be so.”\n\n“Isa!”\n\n“It may not be possible, you know.  And therefore we will go on as\nbefore.  Of course we shall see each other, and of course we shall be\nfriends.”\n\nHerbert Onslow again fretted and again fumed, but he did not have his\nway.  He had looked forward to the ecstasies of a lover’s life, but very\nfew of those ecstasies were awarded to him.  He rarely found himself\nalone with Isa, and when he did do so, her coldness overawed him.  He\ncould dare to scold her and sometimes did do so, but he could not dare to\ntake the slightest liberty.  Once, on that night when the qualified\nconsent of papa and mamma Heine had first been given, he had been allowed\nto touch her lips with his own; but since that day there had been for him\nno such delight as that.  She would not even allow her hand to remain in\nhis.  When they all passed their evenings together in the beer-garden,\nshe would studiously manage that his chair should not be close to her\nown.  Occasionally she would walk with him, but not more frequently now\nthan of yore.  Very few, indeed, of a lover’s privileges did he enjoy.\nAnd in this way the long year wore itself out, and Isa Heine was\none-and-twenty.\n\nAll those family details which had made it inexpedient to apply either to\nold Hatto or to Herbert’s father before the end of the year need not be\nspecially explained.  Old Hatto, who had by far the greater share in the\nbusiness, was a tyrant somewhat feared both by his brother and\nsister-in-law; and the elder Onslow, as was known to them all, was a man\nstraitened in circumstances.  But soon after New Year’s Day the\nproposition was made in the Schrannen Platz, and the letter was written.\nOn this occasion Madame Heine went down to the bank, and together with\nher husband, was closeted for an hour with old Hatto.  Uncle Hatto’s\nverdict was not favourable.  As to the young people’s marriage, that was\nhis brother’s affair, not his.  But as to the partnership, that was a\nserious matter.  Who ever heard of a partnership being given away merely\nbecause a man wanted to marry?  He would keep to his promise, and if the\nstipulated moneys were forthcoming, Herbert Onslow should become a\npartner,—in four years.  Nor was the reply from England more favourable.\nThe alliance was regarded by all the Onslows very favourably.  Nothing\ncould be nicer than such a marriage!  They already knew dear Isa so well\nby description!  But as for the money,—that could not in any way be\nforthcoming till the end of the stipulated period.\n\n“And what shall we do?” said Herbert to Papa Heine.\n\n“You must wait,” said he.\n\n“For four years?” asked Herbert.\n\n“You must wait,—as I did,” said Papa Heine.  “I was forty before I could\nmarry.”  Papa Heine, however, should not have forgotten to say that his\nbride was only twenty, and that if he had waited, she had not.\n\n“Isa,” Herbert said to her, when all this had been fully explained to\nher, “what do you say now?”\n\n“Of course it is all over,” said she, very calmly.\n\n“Oh, Isa, is that your love?”\n\n“No, Herbert, that is not my love; that is my discretion;” and she even\nlaughed with her mild low laughter, as she answered him.  “You know you\nare too impatient to wait four years, and what else therefore can I say?”\n\n“I wonder whether you love me?” said Herbert, with a grand look of\ninjured sentiment.\n\n“Well; in your sense of the word I do not think I do.  I do not love you\nso that I need make every one around us unhappy because circumstances\nforbid me to marry you.  That sort of love would be baneful.”\n\n“Ah no, you do not know what love means!”\n\n“Not your boisterous, heartbreaking English love, Herbert.  And, Herbert,\nsometimes I think you had better go home and look for a bride there.\nThough you fancy that you love me, in your heart you hardly approve of\nme.”\n\n“Fancy that I love you!  Do you think, Isa, that a man can carry his\nheart round to one customer after another as the huckster carries his\nwares?”\n\n“Yes; I think he can.  I know that men do.  What did your hero Waverley\ndo with his heart in that grand English novel which you gave me to read?\nI am not Flora Mac Ivor, but you may find a Rose Bradwardine.”\n\n“And you really wish me to do so?”\n\n“Look here, Herbert.  It is bad to boast, but I will make this boast.  I\nam so little selfish, that I desire above all that you should do that\nwhich may make you most happy and contented.  I will be quite frank with\nyou.  I love you well enough to wait these four years with the hope of\nbecoming your wife when they are over.  But you will think but little of\nmy love when I tell you that this waiting would not make me unhappy.  I\nshould go on as I do now, and be contented.”\n\n“Oh heavens!” sighed Herbert.\n\n“But as I know that this would not suit you,—as I feel sure that such\ndelay would gall you every day, as I doubt whether it would not make you\nsick of me long before the four years be over,—my advice is, that we\nshould let this matter drop.”\n\nHe now walked up to her and took her hand, and as he did so there was\nsomething in his gait and look and tone of voice that stirred her heart\nmore sharply than it had yet been stirred.  “And even that would not make\nyou unhappy,” he said.\n\nShe paused before she replied, leaving her hand in his, for he was\ncontented to hold it without peculiar pressure.  “I will not say so,” she\nreplied.  “But, Herbert, I think that you press me too hard.  Is it not\nenough that I leave you to be the arbiter of my destiny?”\n\n“I would learn the very truth of your heart,” he replied.\n\n“I cannot tell you that truth more plainly.  Methinks I have told it too\nplainly already.  If you wish it, I will hold myself as engaged to\nyou,—to be married to you when those four years are past.  But, remember,\nI do not advise it.  If you wish it, you shall have back your troth.  And\nthat I think will be the wiser course.”\n\nBut neither alternative contented Herbert Onslow, and at the time he did\nnot resolve on either.  He had some little present income from home, some\nfifty pounds a year or so, and he would be satisfied to marry on that and\non his salary as a clerk; but to this papa and mamma Heine would not\nconsent;—neither would Isa.\n\n“You are not a saving, close man,” she said to him when he boasted of his\neconomies.  “No Englishmen are.  You could not live comfortably in two\nsmall rooms, and with bad dinners.”\n\n“I do not care a straw about my dinners.”\n\n“Not now that you are a lover, but you would do when you were a husband.\nAnd you change your linen almost every day.”\n\n“Bah!”\n\n“Yes; bah, if you please.  But I know what these things cost.  You had\nbetter go to England and fetch a rich wife.  Then you will become a\npartner at once, and Uncle Hatto won’t snub you.  And you will be a grand\nman, and have a horse to ride on.”  Whereupon Herbert went away in\ndisgust.  Nothing in all this made him so unhappy as the feeling that\nIsa, under all their joint privations, would not be unhappy herself.  As\nfar as he could see, all this made no difference in Isa.\n\nBut, in truth, he had not yet read Isa’s character very thoroughly.  She\nhad spoken truly in saying that she knew nothing of that boisterous love\nwhich was now tormenting him and making him gloomy; but nevertheless she\nloved him.  She, in her short life, had learnt many lessons of\nself-denial; and now with reference to this half-promised husband she\nwould again have practised such a lesson.  Had he agreed at once to go\nfrom her, she would have balanced her own account within her own breast,\nand have kept to herself all her sufferings.  There would have been no\noutward show of baffled love,—none even in the colour of her cheeks; for\nsuch was the nature of her temperament.  But she did suffer for him.  Day\nby day she began to think that his love, though boisterous as she had at\nfirst called it, was more deep-seated than she had believed.  He made no\nslightest sign that he would accept any of those proffers which she had\nmade him of release.  Though he said so loudly that this waiting for four\nyears was an impossibility, he spoke of no course that would be more\npossible,—except that evidently impossible course of an early marriage.\nAnd thus, while he with redoubled vehemence charged her with coolness and\nwant of love, her love waxed warmer and warmer, and his happiness became\nthe chief object of her thoughts.  What could she do that he might no\nlonger suffer?\n\nAnd then he took a step which was very strange to them all.  He banished\nhimself altogether from the house, going away again into lodgings.  “No,”\nhe said, on the morning of his departure, “I do not release you.  I will\nnever release you.  You are mine, and I have a right so to call you.  If\nyou choose to release yourself, I cannot help it; but in doing so you\nwill be forsworn.”\n\n“Nay, but, Herbert, I have sworn to nothing,” said she, meaning that she\nhad not been formally betrothed to him.\n\n“You can do as you please; it is a matter of conscience; but I tell you\nwhat are my feelings.  Here I cannot stay, for I should go mad; but I\nshall see you occasionally;—perhaps on Sundays.”\n\n“Oh, Herbert!”\n\n“Well, what would you have?  If you really cared to see me it would not\nbe thus.  All I ask of you now is this, that if you decide,—absolutely\ndecide on throwing me over, you will tell me at once.  Then I shall leave\nMunich.”\n\n“Herbert, I will never throw you over.”  So they parted, and Onslow went\nforth to his new lodgings.\n\nHer promise that she would never throw him over was the warmest word of\nlove that she had ever spoken, but even that was said in her own quiet,\nunimpassioned way.  There was in it but very little show of love, though\nthere might be an assurance of constancy.  But her constancy he did not,\nin truth, much doubt.  Four years,—fourteen,—or twenty-four, would be the\nsame to her, he said, as he seated himself in the dull, cold room which\nhe had chosen.  While living in the Ludwigs Strasse he did not know how\nmuch had been daily done for his comfort by that hand which he had been\nso seldom allowed to press; but he knew that he was now cold and\ncomfortless, and he wished himself back in the Ludwigs Strasse.\n\n“Mamma,” said Isa, when they were alone.  “Is not Uncle Hatto rather hard\non us?  Papa said that he would ask this as a favour from his brother.”\n\n“So he did, my dear; and offered to give up more of his own time.  But\nyour Uncle Hatto is hard.”\n\n“He is rich, is he not?”\n\n“Well; your father says not.  Your father says that he spends all his\nincome.  Though he is hard and obstinate, he is not selfish.  He is very\ngood to the poor, but I believe he thinks that early marriages are very\nfoolish.”\n\n“Mamma,” said Isa again, when they had sat for some minutes in silence\nover their work.\n\n“Well, my love?”\n\n“Have you spoken to Uncle Hatto about this?”\n\n“No, dear; not since that day when your papa and I first went to him.  To\ntell the truth, I am almost afraid to speak to him; but, if you wish it,\nI will do so.”\n\n“I do wish it, mamma.  But you must not think that I am discontented or\nimpatient.  I do not know that I have any right to ask my uncle for his\nmoney;—for it comes to that.”\n\n“I suppose it does, my dear.”\n\n“And as for myself, I am happy here with you and papa.  I do not think so\nmuch of these four years.”\n\n“You would still be young, Isa;—quite young enough.”\n\n“And what if I were not young?  What does it matter?  But, mamma, there\nhas been that between Herbert and me which makes me feel myself bound to\nthink of him.  As you and papa have sanctioned it, you are bound to think\nof him also.  I know that he is unhappy, living there all alone.”\n\n“But why did he go, dear?”\n\n“I think he was right to go.  I could understand his doing that.  He is\nnot like us, and would have been fretful here, wanting that which I could\nnot give him.  He became worse from day to day, and was silent and\nmorose.  I am glad he went.  But, mamma, for his sake I wish that this\ncould be shortened.”\n\nMadame Heine told her daughter that she would, if Isa wished it, herself\ngo to the Schrannen Platz, and see what could be done by talking to Uncle\nHatto.  “But,” she added, “I fear that no good will come of it.”\n\n“Can harm come, mamma?”\n\n“No, I do not think harm can come.”\n\n“I’ll tell you what, mamma, I will go to Uncle Hatto myself, if you will\nlet me.  He is cross I know; but I shall not be afraid of him.  I feel\nthat I ought to do something.”  And so the matter was settled, Madame\nHeine being by no means averse to escape a further personal visit to the\nHead of the banking establishment.\n\nMadame Heine well understood what her daughter meant, when she said she\nought to do something, though Isa feared that she had imperfectly\nexpressed her meaning.  When he, Herbert, was willing to do so much to\nprove his love,—when he was ready to sacrifice all the little comforts of\ncomparative wealth to which he had been accustomed, in order that she\nmight be his companion and wife,—did it not behove her to give some proof\nof her love also?  She could not be demonstrative as he was.  Such\nexhibition of feeling would be quite contrary to her ideas of female\ndelicacy, and to her very nature.  But if called on to work for him, that\nshe could do as long as strength remained to her.  But there was no\nsacrifice which would be of service, nor any work which would avail.\nTherefore she was driven to think what she might do on his behalf, and at\nlast she resolved to make her personal appeal to Uncle Hatto.\n\n“Shall I tell papa?” Isa asked of her mother.\n\n“I will do so,” said Madame Heine.  And then the younger member of the\nfirm was informed as to the step which was to be taken; and he, though he\nsaid nothing to forbid the attempt, held out no hope that it would be\nsuccessful.\n\nUncle Hatto was a little snuffy man, now full seventy years of age, who\npassed seven hours of every week-day of his life in the dark back chamber\nbehind the banking-room of the firm, and he had so passed every week-day\nof his life for more years than any of the family could now remember.  He\nhad made the house what it was, and had taken his brother into\npartnership when that brother married.  All the family were somewhat\nafraid of him, including even his partner.  He rarely came to the\napartments in the Ludwigs Strasse, as he himself lived in one of the\nolder and shabbier suburbs on the other side of the town.  Thither he\nalways walked, starting punctually from the bank at four o’clock, and\nfrom thence he always walked in the morning, reaching the bank punctually\nat nine.  His two nieces knew him well; for on certain stated days they\nwere wont to attend on him at his lodgings, where they would be regaled\nwith cakes, and afterwards go with him to some old-fashioned beer-garden\nin his neighbourhood.  But these festivities were of a sombre kind; and\nif, on any occasion, circumstances prevented the fulfilment of the\nceremony, neither of the girls would be loud in their lamentations.\n\nIn London, a visit paid by a niece to her uncle would, in all\nprobability, be made at the uncle’s private residence; but at Munich\nprivate and public matters were not so effectually divided.  Isa\ntherefore, having put on her hat and shawl, walked off by herself to the\nSchrannen Platz.\n\n“Is Uncle Hatto inside?” she asked; and the answer was given to her by\nher own lover.  Yes, he was within; but the old clerk was with him.  Isa,\nhowever, signified her wish to see her uncle alone, and in a few minutes\nthe ancient grey-haired servant of the house came out into the larger\nroom.\n\n“You can go in now, Miss Isa,” he said.  And Isa found herself in the\npresence of her uncle before she had been two minutes under the roof.  In\nthe mean time Ernest Heine, her father, had said not a word, and Herbert\nknew that something very special must be about to occur.\n\n“Well, my bonny bird,” said Uncle Hatto, “and what do you want at the\nbank?”  Cheery words, such as these, were by no means uncommon with Uncle\nHatto; but Isa knew very well that no presage could be drawn from them of\nany special good nature or temporary weakness on his part.\n\n“Uncle Hatto,” she began, rushing at once into the middle of her affair,\n“you know, I believe, that I am engaged to marry Herbert Onslow?”\n\n“I know no such thing,” said he.  “I thought I understood your father\nspecially to say that there had been no betrothal.”\n\n“No, Uncle Hatto, there has been no betrothal; that certainly is true;\nbut, nevertheless, we are engaged to each other.”\n\n“Well,” said Uncle Hatto, very sourly; and now there was no longer any\ncheery tone, or any calling of pretty names.\n\n“Perhaps you may think all this very foolish,” said Isa, who, spite of\nher resolves to do so, was hardly able to look up gallantly into her\nuncle’s face as she thus talked of her own love affairs.\n\n“Yes, I do,” said Uncle Hatto.  “I do think it foolish for young people\nto hold themselves betrothed before they have got anything to live on,\nand so I have told your father.  He answered me by saying that you were\nnot betrothed.”\n\n“Nor are we.  Papa is quite right in that.”\n\n“Then, my dear, I would advise you to tell the young man that, as neither\nof you have means of your own, the thing must be at an end.  It is the\nonly step for you to take.  If you agreed to wait, one of you might die,\nor his money might never be forth coming, or you might see somebody else\nthat you liked better.”\n\n“I don’t think I shall do that.”\n\n“You can’t tell.  And if you don’t, the chances are ten to one that he\nwill.”\n\nThis little blow, which was intended to be severe, did not hit Isa at all\nhard.  That plan of a Rose Bradwardine she herself had proposed in good\nfaith, thinking that she could endure such a termination to the affair\nwithout flinching.  She was probably wrong in this estimate of her power;\nbut, nevertheless, her present object was his release from unhappiness\nand doubt, not her own.\n\n“It might be so,” she said.\n\n“Take my word for it, it would.  Look all around.  There was Adelaide\nSchropner,—but that was before your time, and you would not remember.”\nConsidering that Adelaide Schropner had been for many years a\ngrandmother, it was probable that Isa would not remember.\n\n“But, Uncle Hatto, you have not heard me.  I want to say something to\nyou, if it will not take too much of your time.”  In answer to which,\nUncle Hatto muttered something which was unheeded, to signify that Isa\nmight speak.\n\n“I also think that a long engagement is a foolish thing, and so does\nHerbert.”\n\n“But he wants to marry at once.”\n\n“Yes, he wants to marry—perhaps not at once, but soon.”\n\n“And I suppose you have come to say that you want the same thing.”\n\nIsa blushed ever so faintly as she commenced her answer.  “Yes, uncle, I\ndo wish the same thing.  What he wishes, I wish.”\n\n“Very likely,—very likely.”\n\n“Don’t be scornful to me, uncle.  When two people love each other, it is\nnatural that each should wish that which the other earnestly desires.”\n\n“Oh, very natural, my dear, that you should wish to get married!”\n\n“Uncle Hatto, I did not think that you would be unkind to me, though I\nknew that you would be stern.”\n\n“Well, go on.  What have you to say?  I am not stern; but I have no doubt\nyou will think me unkind.  People are always unkind who do not do what\nthey are asked.”\n\n“Papa says that Herbert Onslow is some day to become a partner in the\nbank.”\n\n“That depends on certain circumstances.  Neither I nor your papa can say\nwhether he will or no.”\n\nBut Isa went on as though she had not heard the last reply.  “I have come\nto ask you to admit him as a partner at once.”\n\n“Ah, I supposed so;—just as you might ask me to give you a new ribbon.”\n\n“But, uncle, I never did ask you to give me a new ribbon.  I never asked\nyou to give me anything for myself; nor do I ask this for myself.”\n\n“Do you think that if I could do it,—which of course I can’t,—I would not\nsooner do it for you, who are my own flesh and blood, than for him, who\nis a stranger?”\n\n“Nay; he is no stranger.  He has sat at your desk and obeyed your orders\nfor nearly four years.  Papa says that he has done well in the bank.”\n\n“Humph!  If every clerk that does well,—pretty well, that is,—wanted a\npartnership, where should we be, my dear?  No, my dear, go home and tell\nhim when you see him in the evening that all this must be at an end.\nMen’s places in the world are not given away so easily as that.  They\nmust either be earned or purchased.  Herbert Onslow has as yet done\nneither, and therefore he is not entitled to take a wife.  I should have\nbeen glad to have had a wife at his age,—at least I suppose I should, but\nat any rate I could not afford it.”\n\nBut Isa had by no means as yet done.  So far the interview had progressed\nexactly as she had anticipated.  She had never supposed it possible that\nher uncle would grant her so important a request as soon as she opened\nher mouth to ask it.  She had not for a moment expected that things would\ngo so easily with her.  Indeed she had never expected that any success\nwould attend her efforts; but, if any success were possible, the work\nwhich must achieve that success must now commence.  It was necessary that\nshe should first state her request plainly before she began to urge it\nwith such eloquence as she had at her command.\n\n“I can understand what you say, Uncle Hatto.”\n\n“I am glad of that, at any rate.”\n\n“And I know that I have no right to ask you for anything.”\n\n“I do not say that.  Anything in reason, that a girl like you should ask\nof her old uncle, I would give you.”\n\n“I have no such reasonable request to make, uncle.  I have never wanted\nnew ribbons from you or gay toys.  Even from my own mother I have not\nwanted them;—not wanted them faster than they seemed to come without any\nasking.”\n\n“No, no; you have been a good girl.”\n\n“I have been a happy girl; and quite happy with those I loved, and with\nwhat Providence had given me.  I had nothing to ask for.  But now I am no\nlonger happy, nor can I be unless you do for me this which I ask of you.\nI have wanted nothing till now, and now in my need I come to you.”\n\n“And now you want a husband with a fortune!”\n\n“No!” and that single word she spoke, not loudly, for her voice was low\nand soft, but with an accent which carried it sharply to his ear and to\nhis brain.  And then she rose from her seat as she went on.  “Your scorn,\nuncle, is unjust,—unjust and untrue.  I have ever acted maidenly, as has\nbecome my mother’s daughter.”\n\n“Yes, yes, yes;—I believe that.”\n\n“And I can say more than that for myself.  My thoughts have been the\nsame, nor have my wishes even, ever gone beyond them.  And when this\nyoung man came to me, telling me of his feelings, I gave him no answer\ntill I had consulted my mother.”\n\n“She should have bade you not to think of him.”\n\n“Ah, you are not a mother, and cannot know.  Why should I not think of\nhim when he was good and kind, honest and hardworking?  And then he had\nthought of me first.  Why should I not think of him?  Did not mamma\nlisten to my father when he came to her?”\n\n“But your father was forty years old, and had a business.”\n\n“You gave it him, Uncle Hatto.  I have heard him say.”\n\n“And therefore I am to do as much for you.  And then next year Agnes will\ncome to me; and so before I die I shall see you all in want, with large\nfamilies.  No, Isa; I will not scorn you, but this thing I cannot do.”\n\n“But I have not told you all yet.  You say that I want a husband.”\n\n“Well, well; I did not mean to say it harshly.”\n\n“I do want—to be married.”  And here her courage failed her a little, and\nfor a moment her eye fell to the ground.  “It is true, uncle.  He has\nasked me whether I could love him, and I have told him I could.  He has\nasked me whether I would be his wife, and I have given him a promise.\nAfter that, must not his happiness be my happiness, and his misery my\nmisery?  Am I not his wife already before God?”\n\n“No, no,” said Uncle Hatto, loudly.\n\n“Ah, but I am.  None feel the strength of the bonds but those who are\nthemselves bound.  I know my duty to my father and mother, and with God’s\nhelp I will do it, but I am not the less bound to him.  Without their\napproval I will not stand with him at the altar; but not the less is my\nlot joined to his for this world.  Nothing could release me from that but\nhis wish.”\n\n“And he will wish it in a month or two.”\n\n“Excuse me, Uncle Hatto, but in that I can only judge for myself as best\nI may.  He has loved me now for two years—”\n\n“Psha!”\n\n“And whether it be wise or foolish, I have sanctioned it.  I cannot now\ngo back with honour, even if my own heart would let me.  His welfare must\nbe my welfare, and his sorrow my sorrow.  Therefore I am bound to do for\nhim anything that a girl may do for the man she loves; and, as I knew of\nno other resource, I come to you to help me.”\n\n“And he, sitting out there, knows what you are saying.”\n\n“Most certainly not.  He knows no more than that he has seen me enter\nthis room.”\n\n“I am glad of that, because I would not wish that he should be\ndisappointed.  In this matter, my dear, I cannot do anything for you.”\n\n“And that is your last answer, uncle?”\n\n“Yes, indeed.  When you come to think over this some twenty years hence,\nyou will know then that I am right, and that your request was\nunreasonable.\n\n“It may be so,” she replied, “but I do not think it.”\n\n“It will be so.  Such favours as you now ask are not granted in this\nworld for light reasons.”\n\n“Light reasons!  Well, uncle, I have had my say, and will not take up\nyour time longer.”\n\n“Good-bye, my dear.  I am sorry that I cannot oblige you;—that it is\nquite out of my power to oblige you.”\n\nThen she went, giving him her hand as she parted from him; and he, as she\nleft the room looked anxiously at her, watching her countenance and her\ngait, and listening to the very fall of her footstep.  “Ah,” he said to\nhimself; when he was alone, “the young people have the best of it.  The\nsun shines for them; but why should they have all?  Poor as he is, he is\na happy dog,—a happy dog.  But she is twice too good for him.  Why did\nshe not take to one of her own country?”\n\nIsa, as she passed through the bank, smiled sweetly on her father, and\nthen smiled sweetly at her lover, nodding to him with a pleasant kindly\nnod.  If he could have heard all that had passed at that interview, how\nmuch more he would have known of her than he now knew, and how proud he\nwould have been of her love.  No word was spoken as she went out, and\nthen she walked home with even step, as she had walked thither.  It can\nhardly be said that she was disappointed, as she had expected nothing.\nBut people hope who do not expect, and though her step was even and her\nface calm, yet her heart was sad.\n\n“Mamma,” she said, “there is no hope from Uncle Hatto.”\n\n“So I feared, my dear.”\n\n“But I thought it right to try—for Herbert’s sake.”\n\n“I hope it will not do him an injury in the bank.”\n\n“Oh, mamma, do not put that into my head.  If that were added to it all,\nI should indeed be wretched.”\n\n“No; he is too just for that.  Poor young man!  Sometimes I almost think\nit would be better that he should go back to England.”\n\n“Mamma, if he did, I should—break my heart.”\n\n“Isa!”\n\n“Well, mamma!  But do not suppose that I mean to complain, whatever\nhappens.”\n\n“But I had been so sure that you had constrained your feelings!”\n\n“So I had,—till I knew myself.  Mamma, I could wait for years, if he were\ncontented to wait by my side.  If I could see him happy, I could watch\nhim and love him, and be happy also.  I do not want to have him kneeling\nto me, and making sweet speeches; but it has gone too far now,—and I\ncould not bear to lose him.”  And thus to her mother she confessed the\ntruth.\n\nThere was nothing more said between Isa and her mother on the subject,\nand for two days the matter remained as it then stood.  Madame Heine had\nbeen deeply grieved at hearing those last words which her daughter had\nspoken.  To her also that state of quiescence which Isa had so long\naffected seemed to be the proper state at which a maiden’s heart should\nstand till after her marriage vows had been pronounced.  She had watched\nher Isa, and had approved of everything,—of everything till this last\navowal had been made.  But now, though she could not approve, she\nexpressed no disapproval in words.  She pressed her daughter’s hand and\nsighed, and then the two said no more upon the matter.  In this way, for\ntwo days, there was silence in the apartments in the Ludwigs Strasse; for\neven when the father returned from his work, the whole circle felt that\ntheir old family mirth was for the present necessarily laid aside.\n\nOn the morning of the third day, about noon, Madame Heine returned home\nfrom the market with Isa, and as they reached the landing, Agnes met them\nwith a packet.  “Fritz brought it from the bank,” said Agnes.  Now Fritz\nwas the boy who ran messages and swept out the office, and Madame Heine\nput out her hand for the parcel, thinking, not unnaturally, that it was\nfor her.  But Agnes would not give it to her mother, “It is for you,\nIsa,” she said.  Then Isa, looking at the address, recognised the\nhandwriting of her uncle.  “Mamma,” she said, “I will come to you\ndirectly;” and then she passed quickly away into her own room.\n\nThe parcel was soon opened, and contained a note from her uncle, and a\nstiff, large document, looking as though it had come from the hands of a\nlawyer.  Isa glanced at the document, and read some few of the words on\nthe outer fold, but they did not carry home to her mind any clear\nperception of their meaning.  She was flurried at the moment, and the\nwords, perhaps, were not very plain.  Then she took up her note, and that\nwas plain enough.  It was very short, and ran as follows:—\n\n    “My dear Niece,\n\n    You told me on Monday that I was stern, and harsh, and unjust.\n    Perhaps I was.  If so, I hope the enclosed will make amends, and that\n    you will not think me such an old fool as I think myself.\n\n                                                 “Your affectionate uncle,\n                                                             “HATTO HEINE.\n\n    “I have told nobody yet, and the enclosed will require my brother’s\n    signature; but I suppose he will not object.”\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n“But he does not know it, mamma,” said Isa.  “Who is to tell him?  Oh,\nmamma, you must tell him.”\n\n“Nay, my dear; but it must be your own present to him.”\n\n“I could not give it him.  It is Uncle Hatto’s present Mamma, when I left\nhim I thought that his eye was kind to me.”\n\n“His heart, at any rate, has been very kind.”  And then again they looked\nover the document, and talked of the wedding which must now be near at\nhand.  But still they had not as yet decided how Herbert should be\ninformed.\n\nAt last Isa resolved that she herself would write to him.  She did write,\nand this was her letter:—\n\n    “Dear Herbert,\n\n    “Mamma and I wish to see you, and beg that you will come up to us\n    this evening.  We have tidings for you which I hope you will receive\n    with joy.  I may as well tell you at once, as I do not wish to flurry\n    you.  Uncle Hatto has sent to us a document which admits you as a\n    partner into the bank.  If; therefore, you wish to go on with our\n    engagement, I suppose there is nothing now to cause any very great\n    delay.\n\n                                                                    “ISA.”\n\nThe letter was very simple, and Isa, when she had written it, subsided\ninto all her customary quiescence.  Indeed, when Herbert came to the\nLudwigs Strasse, not in the evening as he was bidden to do, but\ninstantly, leaving his own dinner uneaten, and coming upon the Heines in\nthe midst of their dinner, she was more than usually tranquil.  But his\nlove was, as she had told him, boisterous.  He could not contain himself,\nand embraced them all, and then scolded Isa because she was so calm.\n\n“Why should I not be calm,” said she, “now that I know you are happy?”\n\nThe house in the Schrannen Platz still goes by the name of Heine\nBrothers, but the mercantile world in Bavaria, and in some cities out of\nBavaria, is well aware that the real pith and marrow of the business is\nderived from the energy of the young English partner.\n\n\n\n",
