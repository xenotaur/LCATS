    "body": "My marriage has been a failure. I am one of those unfortunate men with\nwhom fate deals unjustly. I tried my best. I started with plenty of\nopportunity, with what I thought was every chance of success. I\nworked the whole thing out carefully\u2014I knew what was necessary for our\nhappiness and I went after it, sanely and unswervingly. I lacked\nneither ambition nor purpose; I did not shirk hard work.\n\nI did my best always\u2014the best both for her and for me. And I lost. The\nwoman I loved and trusted\u2014trusted too much, I know now\u2014deceived me. My\nhonor has been trampled under foot\u2014my marriage wrecked in spite of the\nfact I did everything I could to make it a success.\n\nI shall tell you about it plainly, just as it occurred.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy name is William Durrant; I was born in Philadelphia thirty-two\nyears ago. My family was prominent in Philadelphia society; my mother\na woman of superior culture and a very great social ambition.\n\nI received a university education and then entered my father\u2019s\nbusiness\u2014wholesale neckwear. My mother died soon after this, and as I\nhad no brothers or sisters\u2014or in fact any near relatives\u2014my father and\nI were drawn very close together.\n\nIt was then I learned for the first time the true state of my father\u2019s\naffairs. I can remember perfectly that evening when he had his first\nintimate talk with me; it was about two months after my mother died.\n\n\u201cSit down, Will,\u201d he began. We were in the library of the old Durrant\nmansion on Arch Street. \u201cI want to talk to you\u2014seriously.\u201d\n\nWe drew our chairs together before the fire and I lighted a cigarette.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a child any more, Will,\u201d he went on. \u201cYou\u2019re nearly\ntwenty-six\u2014a man.\u201d He laid his hand on mine with more evidence of\naffection than I had ever had from him before. \u201cWe\u2019re all alone\nnow\u2014you and I. There are many things you don\u2019t understand\u2014and I want\nyou to\u2014for we must be very close to each other now.\u201d\n\nI waited, wondering.\n\n\u201cYou think we\u2019re rich, don\u2019t you? Your mother did, and God knows I was\nnot the one to undeceive her.\u201d He laughed a little bitterly, glancing\naround the luxuriously furnished room.\n\n\u201cWe have always had luxury. Your mother demanded it, Will\u2014it was her\nlife. The Philadelphia Durrants! Luxury\u2014social prestige\u2014I have\nmaintained them, all these years\u2014at what a cost!\u201d He passed his hand\nacross his eyes wearily.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all a sham, Will\u2014a sham. But now it\u2019s over\u2014there\u2019s only you and\nme to please. The bubble is broken. Only you and me\u2014and the wreck of a\nbusiness for us to save.\u201d He raised his hand to check my sharp\nexclamation.\n\n\u201cI have hidden this from you, Will. But we won\u2019t go into that now\u2014it\u2019s\nunimportant.\n\n\u201cI want to talk of you. For twenty-six years you have been scarcely\nunder my guidance. I cannot blame your mother\u2014only myself. I\u2019ve known\nthe sort of life you\u2019ve been leading away from home\u2014the sort of\nfriends you have\u2014the women\u2014\u201d He raised his hand again, and his voice\nrose sharply.\n\n\u201cDid you think I didn\u2019t know about the money you lost at cards, and\nyour mother gave you, time and time again? Do you think I\u2019m ignorant\nof the fact that you\u2014my son\u2014are to-day in the way of becoming a\nwastrel? Do you think so?\u201d\n\nI laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d\n\nHis face softened; he put his hand again over mine. \u201cI cannot blame\nyou\u2014only myself. It is the way you were brought up. But I want you to\nchange, Will. I want you to see yourself and me as we are\u2014I want you\nto love me. We will work together, you and I\u2014work to find some of the\ngood things in life\u2014the real things. I know we\u2019ll find them if we\ntry\u2014if we really pull together.\u201d\n\nThree weeks later he was dead.\n\nThis talk with my father, and one or two others we had subsequently,\nmade a great impression on me. When he died of pneumonia, after an\nillness of only a few days, leaving me utterly alone in the world, I\nresolved to take his advice, for my own good, and act differently. The\nbusiness he left me was indeed in a precarious condition. He had drawn\nfrom it heavily during the last ten years to meet my mother\u2019s\ndemands\u2014and more lately, mine\u2014and handicapped thus by a depleted\ncapital it was going down-hill rapidly.\n\nI realized then that life was not worth living unless one were\nrich\u2014really rich\u2014for money held everything desirable. My father was\nright\u2014the social prestige my mother had maintained was a sham. Without\nthe solidity of real wealth it could never be anything but a bubble\nthat might burst at any moment. I resolved then to settle down; to\nwork untiringly at this business that had been left me.\n\nI found, when my father\u2019s affairs had been settled up, a truly\nastounding number of debts. It has never been my way to do things by\nhalves; I sold the Arch Street house, settled the debts, and moved the\nbusiness and myself to New York for a fresh start.\n\nThe two years that followed I devoted exclusively to work and saw\nmyself in a fair way, ultimately, to succeed in my ambition. I lived\nfor business during these two years\u2014I did nothing else\u2014I thought of\nnothing else. The pleasures of life that I had given up I did not\nbegrudge. They were only postponed. This was my big chance\u2014my only\nchance for wealth and happiness through life\u2014and I was unwilling to do\neven the smallest thing to jeopardize it.\n\nThen I met Ruth Wilson, and six months later we were married. She was\nfive years younger than I\u2014a girl with beauty, of a family nearly the\nequal of the Durrants, and with all the social graces\u2014in a word, a\ngirl of whom any man might be proud.\n\nI knew she would make me a good wife; it was a safe, satisfactory step\nfor me to take. I was glad of this, for I was now as cautious of the\nthings I did as formerly I had been careless.\n\nWe took an apartment on Riverside Drive, and were very happy. We had\nno children. I do not like children; I cannot stand their crying. And\nbesides they are difficult and expensive to bring up properly\u2014father\u2019s\narraignment of me in my younger days showed me that\u2014and it was obvious\nthat no girl of the grace and beauty of Ruth should be so handicapped.\nThat she disagreed with me did not alter my opinion, for I realized\nthat she was hardly more than a child and could not understand things\nas I did.\n\nOur life during these first years of marriage was very satisfactory. I\nworked all day at the office, and two or three nights a week played in\na game of cards which we held regularly at the club. I did not\nintroduce these men to Ruth\u2014they were not her kind\u2014she would not have\nunderstood them. Indeed I should not have played in the game at all,\nexcept that I found the mental relaxation stimulating and helpful to\nme, for I was at this time working very hard. My luck, too, seemed to\nhave changed permanently for the better. Whereas in Philadelphia I had\nfrequently lost, I now won steadily\u2014sums sufficiently large to justify\nin themselves, the amount of time I gave to the pursuit.\n\nOnce or twice a week Ruth and I would go to the theater\u2014to musical\nshows generally, for I liked them best\u2014and occasionally we would play\ncards with friends. This latter diversion interested me not at all. I\nwas having enough of card playing outside, and the people to whom Ruth\nintroduced me were particularly uninteresting. I had no time then for\ntheir chatter about art or music, or the books or plays or operas they\nseemed determined to discuss. The whole thing bored me immensely, and\nprobably, because I do not believe in hypocrisy, I did not hesitate to\nlet them see how I felt.\n\nWe did not leave New York for the summer months, except twice we spent\na week or two at one of the big Atlantic City hotels. My business\nwould have permitted me to leave for longer periods, but I did not\nfeel that we should spend so much money.\n\nOne summer Ruth thoughtlessly suggested that we get away into the\nMaine woods and ramble, or to take a canoe trip somewhere. I explained\nto her how foolish that was\u2014how she particularly, a girl of breeding,\nused to luxury, would not care for that in the way we could afford to\ndo it. Camping was all right, if it were done properly. We Durrants\nonce had a big camp in the Adirondacks\u2014my grandfather had established\nit. There, with the proper staff of servants and with guests of the\nright kind one might rough it comfortably. But my father had given up\nthat camp, and such things were, as yet, quite beyond my means.\n\nI pointed out all this to Ruth, showing her plainly how illogical she\nwas. And so we stayed in town.\n\nThese years, as I have said, were working out very satisfactorily to\nRuth and me. I was getting my business on its feet and the time when\nwe could enjoy some of the real luxuries of life did not now seem so\nvery far distant. That Ruth should be so impatient at the delay had\nnever occurred to me until one day, when we had been married about\nthree years, she spoke of it.\n\n\u201cAre you going to keep on indefinitely this way, Will?\u201d she asked\nquietly.\n\nThis was apropos of the fact that she wanted me to take her that\nevening to the opera. I disliked opera intensely\u2014it seems to me an\nextremely morbid\u2014not to say boring\u2014form of amusement. And besides this\nwas one of the nights our card game was on. I could not explain that\nto Ruth\u2014she would not have realized how much more important to our\nultimate good my evening\u2019s winnings would be than a mere evening at\nthe opera\u2014which in itself was expensive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to the club,\u201d I answered.\n\n\u201cThen I shall call up Gerald Rolf and ask him to take me,\u201d she said.\n\nShe still spoke quietly. That was one of Ruth\u2019s peculiarities, I was\nsoon to discover; she concealed her feelings beneath a quiet,\ndignified reserve. I would rather a woman came right out plainly with\nwhat was in her mind. Then you can meet her with logic.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s agreeable to me,\u201d I rejoined, and went to the club.\n\nI have not mentioned Gerald Rolf. He was a good-natured sort of boy\u2014at\nleast I considered him so at that time\u2014a year or so older than Ruth.\nHe was an artist, painted weird-looking landscapes, and to make his\nliving, did magazine illustrating. When Ruth first introduced him to\nme I thought he was a nice enough boy, except that his interminable\npiano-playing was a nuisance.\n\nI was soon undeceived about Gerald Rolf, soon made to realize how\nuncertain is happiness and how even the most innocent circumstances\nmay become a menace to a married man so easy-going, so tolerant as I.\n\nRuth seemed to like Rolf immensely, although why I could not imagine.\nI had one or two long talks with him. He knew nothing about\nbusiness\u2014indeed even the simplest things seemed quite beyond his\nmental capacity.\n\nI tried to get him to discuss poker\u2014he said he played it a little. But\nthe mathematical laws of chance that govern the game he did not grasp\nat all.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve got me out of my depth, Durrant,\u201d he said, and\nlaughed.\n\nThen he wanted me to play a game of chess, which I cannot conceive any\nrational-minded person being interested in.\n\nGerald Rolf came to our home frequently after that, often on the\nevenings I was out. I should have objected to this; but I did not. I\nadmit this fault freely. I saw their intimacy growing, but I was so\ntrustful, so confident of Ruth, I did nothing to prevent it.\n\nHe was teaching her chess, he said. And she sang a little to his piano\naccompaniment, weird sort of songs\u2014nothing bright or lively of the\nkind I liked. And they went to the opera together sometimes\u2014\u201cin the\ngallery,\u201d as he laughingly told me, for like all artists he had no\nmoney. Then later, they took to horseback riding. But this was\nexpensive, and they rode infrequently.\n\nI saw all this going on, as I have said, and I did nothing to prevent\nit. I suppose because Ruth, curiously enough, seemed to enjoy such\nthings, and her happiness was always uppermost in my mind. It was for\nthe attainment of that I was working so hard\u2014to be able, some day, to\ngive her the things that really would make her happy.\n\nThen, when this had been going on nearly a year, came the climax; and\nI learned, with a shock that was all the greater because of its\nsuddenness, how unjust fate may be to a man who unreservedly trusts\none he loves and who always tries to do the best he can in every way.\n\nThe morning of the particular day I have to tell of, I remember, I\nwent to the office feeling miserably ill. I had taken a sudden chill\nthe night before, and rose with a slight fever and the start of the\ngrip or something of the kind.\n\nAbout four o\u2019clock in the afternoon I felt so badly, I left the office\nand went home. Ruth was out and I went into the library, planning to\nsleep for an hour or two before dinner. I sat down in a large\neasy-chair in a darkened corner of the room, partly sheltered from the\nwindow-light by a screen which stood near by. I was feeling really\nvery miserable and soon fell into a troubled slumber.\n\nI was awakened by the sound of voices and realized that my wife and\nGerald Rolf were in the room. Evidently they had not seen me. They\nwere sitting over by the windows and Ruth was serving him tea; I could\njust see them from my chair, around the corner of the screen.\n\nThe first words that I heard, as soon as I was fully awake,\nelectrified me. And yet I remained silent, did not make my presence\nknown then. I do not know why, for I am not one who believes in\neaves-dropping.\n\nIt was Rolf\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cWe must face it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no avoiding it now.\u201d\n\nRuth did not answer at once. I saw her face was very pale, and her\nhand trembled as she poured him a cup of tea.\n\n\u201cYou should not have told me you loved me, too,\u201d he went on. \u201cThat\nwould have made it easier. You should have rebuked me\u2014sent me away.\u201d\n\nAnother silence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going anyhow,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cGerald!\u201d She put her hand on his arm.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no other way, is there?\u201d He met her eyes steadily. \u201cI love\nyou too much to do anything else but go away. You can understand that,\ncan\u2019t you? After to-day\u2014after what we\u2019ve confessed to each other.\u201d\n\nI held myself back with an effort. My brain was whirling. That this\nimpudent boy should dare talk to Ruth\u2014to my wife\u2014like this!\n\nThere was another silence. Then I saw Ruth slide her hand down his\nforearm until her fingers touched his.\n\n\u201cHave you thought it all over carefully Gerald? Are you sure, quite\nsure, that for you to go away\u2014alone\u2014is the best thing\u2014the right\nthing?\u201d\n\nShe spoke quietly. Even now she seemed to maintain that reserve I\ndisliked in her so intensely.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said; his voice sounded very tired. \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing to\ndo now\u2014with honor.\u201d\n\nHonor! He could prate of honor, when by their very words, their\nthoughts, they were dragging _my_ honor in the mire!\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d She spoke softly\u2014so softly I could hardly hear the\nwords. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, Gerald. I\u2019ve thought about this, too. I\u2019ve seen\nit coming\u2014oh yes, I have\u2014for a very long time. I\u2019ve known what was in\nyour heart\u2014and in mine.\n\n\u201cFor you to go away\u2014never to see me again\u2014that may be the best\nthing\u2014the right thing for you. It will hurt you, of\ncourse\u2014terribly\u2014for a while. And then, inevitably you\u2014you will find\nsome one else\u2014some other woman who will make you happy.\u201d Her voice\ntrembled a little but she still spoke evenly.\n\n\u201cThat is what the future holds for you, Gerald. Are you sure you are\nnot thinking only of yourself when you say we must never see each\nother again? What about me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou! Why, Ruth\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does the future hold for me? You haven\u2019t thought of that, have\nyou, Gerald? Not another love like ours\u2014that is open to you\u2014but not to\nme.\n\n\u201cYou have known me now two years. You know Will\u2014the sort of man he\nis\u2014\u201d I took a new grip on myself at this mention of my name; I would\nhear them out.\n\n\u201cYou know Will,\u201d she repeated; a new note of passion came into her\nvoice. \u201cYou know how empty, how utterly devoid of everything that\nmakes a life worth living mine was until you came into it. All that is\nin the past. But the future\u2014have you thought what you are condemning\nme to in the future? Have you thought of that, Gerald?\u201d\n\nHe avoided her eyes. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be no other\nlove for me. I _have_ thought it all over\u2014I have faced it\u2014and I\ncannot\u2014will not\u2014take our happiness in dishonor.\u201d\n\nShe leaned over the tea-tray and put both her hands on his shoulders,\nforcing him to look at her.\n\n\u201cI love you, Gerald,\u201d she said. \u201cLook at me. I love you with all the\nlove I once thought I felt for him\u2014the love he did not\u2014could\nnot\u2014understand. Do you realize what you have brought me with your\nlove? How you have filled that emptiness that was killing me? How you\nhave\u2014have made my dreams\u2014all those vague little ideals that fill every\ngirl\u2019s heart\u2014do you realize how you have made them all come true?\n\n\u201cYou have won my love, Gerald. Are you going to cast it away\u2014and leave\nme nothing\u2014because you say that to take it would be dishonorable?\u201d\n\nDishonorable! They could talk thus of dishonor! They did not think of\n_my_ honor\u2014the honor of William Durrant\u2014that they were dragging about\nin the slime of their words. I felt a sudden impulse to leap to my\nfeet and confront them; but I held myself firm.\n\n\u201cWe must think of him, too,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot build our happiness\nupon the wreck of his life. We cannot do that, Ruth\u2014we would lose out\nin the end.\u201d\n\nShe dropped her hands from his shoulders.\n\n\u201cHis life wrecked?\u201d She laughed bitterly. \u201cYou do not understand him,\nGerald. Do you think losing me would wreck his life? It would not be\nloss of me, but the loss of his wife that would hurt. His wife\u2014his\nhonor\u2014the honor of William Durrant\u2014that would be attacked. You do not\nunderstand him if you think that.\u201d\n\nAgain she put her hands on his shoulders.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fighting, Gerald,\u201d she went on softly. \u201cFighting for the only\nthing worth while that life holds for me. Are you going to let me go\ndown beaten\u2014a woman who has lost the only good things\u2014real things\u2014a\nwoman ever can hope for. The love of a real man. And\u2014and children. To\nhave children\u2014oh, Gerald, you don\u2019t understand\u2014you don\u2019t understand!\u201d\n\nHer voice broke suddenly and she ended with a sob. I saw his arms go\naround her. I pushed my chair back violently and sprang to my feet.\n\nHow it must have surprised them to be so abruptly confronted by me,\nthe one person in the world they had injured, I can imagine. They both\nstarted guiltily at my sudden appearance. Gerald Rolf rose to his\nfeet; Ruth sat quiet with her eyes fixed upon my face.\n\nI strode across the room. I made up my mind then that there would be\nno heroics\u2014no melodrama. The Durrants did not have to descend to that\nto protect their honor.\n\n\u201cI have heard all you said,\u201d I began sternly; I looked at each of them\nin turn. \u201cI could not help it\u2014sitting there.\u201d\n\nThey met my eyes brazenly. There was a moment of silence; I wondered\nwhich of them would dare address me. Then Gerald Rolf spoke.\n\n\u201cWhat you have heard, Mr. Durrant, is all true\u2014every word of it.\nPerhaps it is better that you did hear\u2014for now you can see things as\nthey really are.\u201d He spoke quite quietly, evidently suppressing with\nan effort his agitation and fear of the consequences of his folly.\n\n\u201cYes, I think now I understand you as you really are\u2014you two. Since\nthat is so\u2014what do you think you\u2019re going to do about it?\u201d I permitted\nmyself a veiled sneer with this question.\n\n\u201cYou heard me say what I was going to do,\u201d Gerald Rolf answered.\n\nRuth gave a low exclamation and I turned on her sternly.\n\n\u201cBe quiet,\u201d I said. \u201cWe will settle this.\u201d I faced Gerald Rolf again.\n\n\u201cYour decision is very wise,\u201d I said sarcastically. \u201cIt is fortunate\nthat\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI said I was going away,\u201d he broke in. \u201cNeither of you will ever\nagain see or hear of me.\u201d\n\nAgain I heard Ruth give a low exclamation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m leaving her happiness with you.\u201d\n\nI took a menacing step toward him as he said this. He faced me with an\nassumption of bravery.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m leaving her to you,\u201d he went on, \u201cWhat has happened has\nbeen\u2014unfortunate\u2014\u201d His voice faltered, but he drew his lips tightly\ntogether and continued.\n\n\u201cPerhaps it has been for the best\u2014perhaps the future may hold more\nhappiness for you both than the past gave you.\u201d\n\nI could listen to no more of this.\n\n\u201cGo,\u201d I said sharply.\n\nHe picked up his hat and coat which were lying near by. Then, avoiding\nRuth\u2019s eyes, he turned again to me.\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d he said. He hesitated. Then:\n\n\u201cFor her sake I hope you will become a man,\u201d he added.\n\nHe met Ruth\u2019s tearful eyes in good-by and before I could answer this\nlast insult, he had left the room.\n\nI sent Ruth to her bedroom immediately; she was sobbing hysterically,\nin no fit mental condition for me to talk with then. Some hours\nlater\u2014after I had dined alone, I went in to see her.\n\nI suffered greatly during those hours\u2014how greatly no one but myself\nwill ever know. The whole thing came so unexpectedly; I had always\ntrusted Ruth so implicitly. The fact that a thing so unsavory, so\nsordid, should come to me, of all people, almost unnerved me. A\nmarriage of one of the Durrants to be so besmirched! It was almost\nunbelievable.\n\nSuch things had happened to others. That I could understand. But when\nI had selected Ruth for my wife, I had been confident of her worth\u2014her\nbreeding, her very manner seemed to make such a catastrophe as this\nimpossible. Yet it had come and I had to face it\u2014make the best of\nit\u2014hide it from the world as my mother would have done. Our marriage\nmust go on, of course, but it would never be for me that it had been.\n\nI found Ruth sitting on her bed staring blankly before her.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d I said; I felt that in justice to myself I should be harsh in\nthis interview. \u201cWell, what have you to say for yourself?\u201d\n\nShe stared at me with a light in her eyes that made me doubt her\nsanity.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, in that irritating, soft voice of hers. \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow\u2014I cannot think\u2014what to do.\u201d\n\nI leaned against the wall just inside the doorway. I was quite calm; I\neven permitted myself to smile.\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t you go away now?\u201d she added, almost in a whisper. \u201cYou must\nleave me alone\u2014I must think\u2014decide\u2014\u201d\n\nShe seemed to be still on the verge of hysteria and I concluded it\nwould be useless for me to go on talking then.\n\n\u201cIt is a great shock to me,\u201d I said deliberately, \u201cto find that of all\nthe women in the world I should have chosen one who was bad.\u201d\n\nWith that I turned and left her.\n\nI spent that evening at the club\u2014trying to forget in the card-playing\nthe trouble that had come upon me so abruptly.\n\nThe next morning when I went to see Ruth in her room, I found she had\ngone, taking with her only a few personal effects! I called up Gerald\nRolf immediately after breakfast; they told me he had left the city.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat was six months ago. She did not come back and she has asked me\nnow to divorce her. She says she has found happiness, and I suppose\nshe thinks she has. I shall divorce her, of course. I have always\ntried to do the right thing. But the unavoidable publicity will hurt\nme terribly.\n\nI have told you what occurred, plainly. I have nothing to add. I tried\nmy best. Yet, in spite of that\u2014and the injustice of it sometimes makes\nme very bitter\u2014my marriage has been a failure.",
