    "body": "The examiner looked doubtful and said, \"But Mr. Holloway, regulations\nrequire that I read your log before I take verbal testimony.\"\n\nHolloway's face was drawn and ravaged. His bloodshot eyes sat in\nblack pits. They were trained on the Examiner but looked through him\nrather than at him.\n\nHolloway said, \"But, I _must_ talk! I've got to tell you about it. I\nhave to keep talking.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\nHolloway's words tumbled out. \"It started in the control cabin there\nin deep space. When Mrs. Kelvey came in. She was the blonde one. I\nturned around and she said, 'Captain, there's a great big tiger in the\ncompanionway.'\"\n\nThe desperate Holloway, fearful of being stopped or running out of\nwords, went into minute detail. \"She made the statement as a pouting\ncomplaint, almost casually. Then, before I could speak, she realized\nwhat she'd said and her face changed. A kind of horrified double-take.\n'_A tiger? In the companionway of a space ship?_' This last was an\nincredulous question she asked herself. Then she fainted. I looked\noutside. I thought I saw something blurred and indistinct but it\nvanished quickly if it was really there at all. The companionway was\nempty. No tiger. No animal of any kind--\"\n\nThe Examiner, holding up a hand of protest, looked like a man\ndirecting traffic. \"Please, Mr. Holloway--please. We must remember\nregulations.\"\n\nHolloway's eyes closed for a moment but he resolutely forced them open\nas though afraid of something.\n\nThe scene was Holloway's two-room suite in the Space Port Hotel. There\nwere three men present--Holloway, skipper of the _Space King_, John\nMason, Port Resident, and Merle Kennedy, Section Examiner for the\nSpace Authority people. Kennedy regarded Holloway with frank concern.\nGood heavens--the man was a complete mess. Looked ready to collapse.\nKennedy turned to Mason. \"This can be postponed, you know.\"\n\nMason was regarding Holloway also. Strange, he thought; Holloway had\nleft in a fanfare of publicity. Now it appeared his return would be\neven more dramatic. Maybe Holloway was that kind of a chap; the kind\nthings just happened to.\n\nHe was quite young though he certainly didn't look it now. He'd been\nknown as a playboy ever since his father struck it big in Venusian\noil. But good-looking, personable, he had worn the label well. He'd\nbeen good copy because the public regarded him with patronizing\naffection. To them, he'd been a nice kid having fun; not a young\nwastrel wasting his father's money.\n\nNaturally he would pick a glamour girl to play the romantic feminine\nrole and Melody Hayden had filled the bill perfectly. Together, they\nhad enchanted the public. Princess and Prince Charming stuff. Then\ntragedy. Disaster in a rocketing sports car; Melody's coffin sealed\nbefore the funeral; young Holloway coming off without a scratch.\nMelody's death was a bombshell and everyone asked. _What will he do\nnow?_ expecting of course, something sensational.\n\nHe didn't let them down. Dramatically, he announced a completely new\nlife. He bought a space ship and foreswore his old ways. He had quite\na reputation as a big game hunter. He'd stalked the vicious Plutonian\nice bears and lain in Venusian swamps waiting for the ten-ton lizards\nto rise out of the slime. He had knocked over the wiliest of animals,\na telepathic Uranian mountain wolf and had dropped in flight a Martian\nradar-bat, a feat duplicated by only three other marksmen of record.\n\nSo what more natural occupation than guiding hunting parties in deep\nspace? Holloway had been obviously torn by Melody's tragic death.\nPerhaps out among the stars he could forget.\n\n\n\nThere had been some trouble, Mason recalled, in clearing Holloway's\nfirst cruise. A party of five. Not to any established hunting ground\nbut a D. U. thing. _Destination Unknown_, and they were always\ntrouble. Clearance had been made, though, and now--here was Holloway\nback again--dramatically of course--with one of his party dead and the\nother four in trance-like stupors. Strange.\n\nAnd stranger still, Holloway's reason for wanting to talk immediately;\nwith no rest--no medical attention:\n\n\"It will help keep me awake. I mustn't go to sleep. Can't I make you\nunderstand? _I've got to stay awake._\"\n\nMason pitied the man. He turned to Kennedy. \"I have the log here, sir.\nPerhaps you could go over it now--\"\n\nHolloway leaned forward. \"I'll tell you what's in the log. Every word\nof it. If I just sit here waiting--\"\n\nMason laid a hand on his knee. \"It's all right, old chap. I won't let\nyou go to sleep. You and I will talk while Mr. Kennedy goes through\nthe log. It won't take long.\"\n\nMason handed the book to Kennedy. He was almost apologetic. \"It's a\nstrange log, sir, It--\"\n\n\"Strange?\" Kennedy frowned. Logs had no right to be strange. There\nwere regulations--rules stating exactly how a log should be kept.\n\n\"Well sir, the lad is young. His first trip. I just meant there's\nperhaps a little more in the log than should appear there.\"\n\n\"We'll see,\" Kennedy said. There was a slight frost on his words. If\ndisciplinary measures were in the offing it would pay not to get too\ncozy with Holloway and the Resident.\n\nKennedy opened the log. The first entry was dated June 3rd, 4:10 p. m.\nEarth time. Kennedy frowned. Permissible of course, but sloppy, very\nsloppy. The better skippers computed from Orion immediately after\nblast-off. Kennedy set back and began to read:\n\n\n_June 3rd, 4:10 p. m._\n\nWe blasted at 2:18 p. m. A good getaway. Course 58.329 by the polar\nangle. No blast sickness among the passengers. They are old hands. I\nput the automatic board into control at 3:50 p. m. I checked the\ntubes. Pressures balanced and equal.\n\nI don't like this cruise. I don't like Murdo. He's a domineering slob.\nThe other four, well--Keebler is an alcoholic, Kelvey an empty-headed\nopportunist. I don't particularly dislike them. They're just a\nworthless pair who would rather fawn on Murdo and take his insults\nthan work for a living. The two wives are both young. Martha Keebler\nhas a child's mind in a woman's body. Jane Kelvey is an oversexed\nwitch with an indecent exposure complex. I may have trouble with her.\nAlready she's parading around in skimpy shorts and a bra. Evidently\nMurdo doesn't care for women. He pays no attention to her. Money and\npower are his dish. And a terrible restlessness.\n\nMelody baby--I wish you were here--\n\n\n_June 4th, 3:00 p. m._\n\nI had a talk with Murdo about this silly cruise. Tried to swing him\nonto something that makes a little more sense. Pluto, Venus,\nGanymede--some hunting ground I'm familiar with. No good. Even a\nsuggestion and he thinks you're crossing him and snorts like a bull.\nStill demands to go to this place where big game prowls in space.\nWhere elephants and leopards and snakes and anything you can name fly\naround your ship and look in your ports. Where you do your hunting in\nspace suits right out in the void.\n\nWhy in hell did I fall for this idiocy? Guess I just didn't care.\nMaybe I thought it was a good idea because it sounded like a cruise\nyou could get killed on without much trouble. No--I shouldn't say\nthat. Melody wouldn't like me to say it. She was so wonderful--so\nlevel-headed. How wrong they all were about us. About her. Because she\nwas so beautiful, I guess. I tried to tell them I'd married an angel\nand they took bets among themselves on how long it would last. The\nanswer to that would have been forever. It still is. I've lost so much\nand learned so much in such a very short time. The hell with Murdo and\nhis four puppets. I'll take them out and bring them back. Then I'll go\nsomewhere alone and I won't come back at all.\n\nMelody.\n\nCourse 28.493 by the polar angle. Went through small asteroid\nfield....\n\n\n\nKennedy looked up sharply. He frowned. \"This log is unacceptable.\"\n\nHolloway was pacing the floor, his eyes blank and terrible\n\"Unacceptable?\"\n\n\"Course and position should be noted within each twenty-four hour\nperiod. You missed June 5th entirely. You--\" Kennedy leafed through\nthe pages. \"Why at times you missed three and four days in sequence!\"\n\n\"Sometimes I didn't have time to write.\"\n\nMason tried to hide his disgust. How did men like Kennedy get into\npositions they weren't fitted for? The ass! Couldn't he see this man\nwas suffering? Mason said, \"Why not reserve comment until you've\nfinished, Mr. Kennedy?\"\n\nKennedy's eyes widened at the sharp tone of Mason's voice. Really.\nWhen residents start dictating to Examiners--Kennedy saw the stiffness\nin Mason's face. And something more. He went quickly back to his\nreading:\n\n\n_June 6, 1:00 p. m._\n\nI talked some more with Murdo about this fool cruise. He got wind of\nour destination--wherever it is--from some rich idiot in Paris. And I\ndon't use _idiot_ figuratively. His informant was in some kind of a\nprivate nut house--an exclusive insane asylum of idiots with lots of\nmoney--and he had lucid intervals. At one of these times he told Murdo\nwhere he'd been and what had happened. I don't think Murdo believes\nall of it but he wants to see for himself. Well, if he wants to spend\nhis money chasing meteorites it's his business.\n\nKeebler got drunk as a goat. Strapped him in his bunk and left him\nthere. Murdo spent a few hours explaining guns to Mrs. Keebler. I\nthink he enjoys the look of wonder on her face. Makes him feel very\nsuperior knowledgewise. Her face is just built that way and so far as\nshe's concerned he could be talking Greek. He thinks she's very\nbeautiful. I wonder if he ever saw Melody's picture?\n\nCourse 36.829 by the Orion angle. All clear.\n\n\n_June 9th, 1:00 a. m._\n\nCourse 36.841 by the Orion angle. Small asteroids.\n\nJane Kelvey is bored and has started taking it out on me. When I\npassed her door it was open. She was taking a sponge bath, stark naked\nin the middle of the cabin. She turned around to face me and did a\nvery bad job of acting flustered, trying to cover herself up with a\nsmall sponge! How crude can a female get? She was hoping I'd come in.\nIf I had it would have been to slap her face. I got away as fast as I\ncould.\n\n\n_June 10th, 7 p. m._\n\nCourse 41.864 by the Orion angle. Brushed a small asteroid.\n\nI've been noting the time wrong. It should be figured on a\ntwenty-four-hour cycle. Midnight to midnight, the hell with it.\n\nHad a fight with Murdo. He wanted to take over the ship. His words\nwere, \"Let's get some speed out of this slop bucket.\" I reminded him I\nwas Captain. He reminded me he was footing the bills. I asked him how\nhe would like to be locked in his cabin for the remainder of the\ncruise? He didn't say, but I guess he wouldn't have liked it because\nhe quieted down. Keebler has been quietly drunk for the last two days.\nLucky Keebler.\n\n\n_June 13th, 18 hours._\n\nCourse 26.932 by the Virgo angle. Went four degrees off course to\navoid small planetoid.\n\nJane Kelvey came to my cabin an hour ago. The rest were asleep. She\nwore a blue dressing gown with nothing under it. I want to set down\nwhat happened in case there's ever a kickback although I don't think\nthere ever will be.\n\nI was sitting in a chair and she came up behind me and it was very\nunfortunate because I saw the blue dressing gown first. By sheer\nchance it was almost exactly like the one Melody wore that first\nnight. I was thinking of Melody. Melody was all around me and inside\nme. In my mind, in my heart, in all my aching regrets.\n\nSo when that dressing gown brushed me, something electric happened\ninside and I got up and took Jane Kelvey in my arms. It wasn't more\nthan three or four seconds but in that time the gown had been brushed\naside. Then I came to my senses and pushed her away.\n\nThe dressing gown stayed parted. She stepped back, confused. She said,\n\"What's the matter? Are you scared?\"\n\n\"I'm disgusted. Button your gown. Get out of here!\"\n\n\"What are you? Not one of those noble creatures I hope--who wouldn't\ntouch a man's wife.\"\n\n\"I said get out! I wouldn't touch you regardless.\"\n\n\"But you just did.\"\n\n\"It was a mistake. I--\"\n\n\"Look--I'm a woman. You're a man--I think. We're alone in space and\nlife is short. Let's have fun and then forget about it.\"\n\nI slapped her across the mouth. A skipper can be jailed for life for\nstriking a passenger. Even with cause. But I slapped her and I'm\nsetting it down in the log....\n\n\n\nKennedy looked up from his reading. \"Jane Kelvey--she is the dead\none?\"\n\nMason nodded.\n\nKennedy looked at Holloway with marked severity. \"Are you sure you\nonly slapped her?\"\n\nMason exploded. \"Good God, man. Did you see the body? You're not\nimplying he did that to her, are you?\"\n\n\"I'm not implying anything,\" Kennedy said within a restrained grimness\nthat infuriated Mason.\n\n\"Why don't you finish the log before you start passing judgment?\"\n\nKennedy leafed through the pages. \"I--wait a minute! This log doesn't\ncover the whole cruise! It breaks off in the middle of a sentence!\"\n\n\"Read what's there, man! Read what's there.\"\n\n\"Very serious--very serious,\" Kennedy muttered. \"Not completing a log.\nNo license should have been issued this man. Lax! Very lax.\" He sat\nback to make himself more comfortable and prepared to go on with his\nreading.\n\n\n_June 30th--3 hours_\n\nCourse 29.341 by the Virgo angle. I think that's the course. The\ninstruments are acting funny. In fact a lot of things seem to be\nwrong. Some of the constellations aren't in the right places anymore.\n\nI began noticing these things a couple of days ago and spoke to Murdo.\nI suggested we turn back. I told him it was my duty as a skipper to\nlook out for the welfare of my passengers. And that included not\ncontinuing if vital instruments showed signs of failure.\n\nHe sneered at me and said, \"I thought you were a big game hunter,\nHolloway?\"\n\nI told him I'd hunted big game--yes.\n\n\"It doesn't sound like it. You sound like a timid old woman. So you've\nmade some miscalculations. The course is still right. It's on the\nflight pattern in the automatic control board and I know it's correct\nbecause I gave it to you.\"\n\n\"But if instruments fail nothing stays right.\"\n\n\"Okay--you're the skipper. If you've turned yellow and want to show\nyour tail I guess there's nothing I can do about it.\"\n\nHe almost got his jaw broken, but I was able to hold myself. Then,\nsuddenly, I didn't care. I didn't care whether Murdo stayed alive or\ngot killed. As to the others--they'd come on the cruise with their\neyes open. They deserved whatever they got. And I certainly didn't\ngive a damn about myself. Guess I wasn't cut out to skipper a ship. A\nskipper should care. That's all he _should_ do. Just care. I'd rather\ndream about Melody.\n\n\nI don't know what the date is. The chronometer stopped so I don't even\nknow what time it is. But what does it matter about the time if you\ndon't even know what day it is? We just go on and on.\n\nMurdo--I can't figure out. Windbag or not--braggart or no--he has an\niron will. I think he's scared but he won't admit it. And some\nstubborn streak inside him won't let him turn tail and run. He hides\nhis fear behind long accounts of his hunting trips. He describes the\nvicious animals he's killed. He bores us with accounts of his skill as\na great hunter.\n\nThe rest listen because they have to. I go to my cabin and remember\nMelody.\n\nThe rest are scared too, but they're too scared of Murdo to let him\nknow it. That's an odd one. Scared for your life but afraid to tell\nthe big man because he might kill you. Would Murdo kill in a fit of\nrage? I don't know.\n\nKeebler stays drunk so none of it bothers him. Keebler's wife, I\nthink, is in love with Murdo but it's a kind of little-girl love. She\nnever quite grew up. Kelvey glues himself to Murdo and sticks like a\nplaster. He seems to consider Murdo a haven, as though Murdo's bulk\nwill make everything all right.\n\nJane Kelvey hasn't quit making passes at me but they're half-hearted.\nShe bothers me. I'm uneasy when she's around. I get the feeling that\nany minute she might drop to her knees and beg. What do you do with a\nwoman on her knees before you, begging? Maybe before long her husband\nwill look good to her. Maybe she'll be able to get him away from\nMurdo's side for a while.\n\nI look at both these women and realize what I lost. Melody.\n\n\n\nJane Kelvey came to my cabin. It's hit her that things aren't right.\nShe's scared. She asked, \"Why did you tell Murdo you wanted to turn\nback?\"\n\n\"Because I thought we'd come too far.\"\n\n\"Do you still think so?\"\n\n\"Everything will be all right.\"\n\n\"The instruments--are they working again?\"\n\nI lied to her. \"They're working.\"\n\n\"Do you think it's really as Murdo says--that there are animals out in\nspace?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nShe looked wan and forlorn and I was sorry for her. She said, \"I've\nonly been on one hunting trip in my life.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\"\n\n\"In India. A boy carried my gun for me. When the tiger came the boy\nhanded me the gun and told me where to point. I fired but I didn't hit\nthe tiger. Somebody else shot it.\"\n\n\"That was too bad.\"\n\n\"No, it was all right. He was such a big beautiful animal. So sleek\nand powerful.\"\n\nI saw her body tremble as she closed her eyes. I said, \"You better get\nsome rest.\"\n\nShe passed a hand over her eyes and then gave me an odd wistful smile.\n\"Animals are smarter, I think. We _do_ make awful messes out of our\nlives, don't we?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid we do.\"\n\n\"But is it our fault? God makes us this way. We can't help that.\"\n\n\"No, I guess we can't.\"\n\n\"Why did God make us like we are?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Jane. Let's hope _He_ does.\"\n\n\"Isn't that sacrilege or something? Doubting Him?\"\n\n\"I guess it is.\"\n\nShe reached out suddenly and touched my face. \"You're a nice guy. I\ndon't blame you for slapping me.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. You're pretty nice yourself.\"\n\nThe smile faded. \"I'm not,\" she said miserably, and left the cabin.\n\nPoor kid. I forgot her and thought of Melody.\n\n\nSomething's gone wrong with everything. Not a very scientific\nstatement for a skipper to make but that's how it is. The stars have\ndisappeared. The instruments jumped around as though they had minds of\ntheir own. The dial needles spin around like crazy.\n\nAnd something else--something even worse. Space has _changed_. I mean\nthere's something out there in space. First I just felt it. A raw\nuneasiness. Then I trained a light through the port and I could see\nit. Stuff that looks like dust but isn't. It's hazy and yet it\nsparkles and you have a sense of being on a ship that's pushing its\nway through a fog so thick the friction holds you back. And there's\nsomething more about this sparkling fog. You look out at it and it\nseems to be looking back at you. Or maybe I'm losing my mind. Anyhow,\nthat's the way it seems. As though it's waiting for you to speak to\nit--say hello or something.\n\nI guess I'm going crazy.\n\nThe sparkling fog is affecting the others, too. They've all quieted\ndown and they slip along the bulkheads as though they were being\nfollowed. Only Murdo blusters back. He says, what the hell? We\nexpected something different, didn't we? Well, this is sure different\nenough, isn't it?\n\nI'd turn back but I don't know how. I have nothing to go by. The\ninstruments make no sense.\n\n\nI _am_ going crazy. I looked out the port just now and saw a water\nbuffalo. It was standing right out there in space with its head down\nlooking at the ship! I had a light turned on it and suddenly it\ncharged and hit the port headon. It bounced off and went staggering\naway and disappeared.\n\nBut it left a big white scratch on the quartz outside. At least I\nthink it did. Wait. I'll look again. Yes. A big white scratch. It's\nstill there. So how can I be mad? Maybe it's a new kind of madness....\n\n\n\nSome of the sparkling fog has penetrated the ship. Turn out the light\nand you can see it in the cabin. Not as thick as out in the void but\nthick enough to see; thick enough to stand there and ask you to talk\nto it.\n\nMurdo is ready to turn back. He came to the control room and said, \"I\nsaw it out there.\"\n\n\"You saw what?\"\n\nHis face was pale and his hands twitched. \"A boa-constrictor. Exactly\nlike the one I killed four years ago on the Amazon. It came to the\nport and looked in at me.\"\n\n\"It must be your imagination.\"\n\n\"No. It was there. Let's turn back. Get out of this.\"\n\n\"I wish we could.\"\n\n\"You mean--?\"\n\n\"I don't know where back is. We might just as well go as we are.\nChanging course doesn't help if you don't know your directions. Our\nonly hope is to drive on out of this cloud. If I turned I might go\nright back into it.\"\n\n\"Then one direction is as good as another?\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\nHis mind wandered as he turned away. \"I didn't know it would be like\nthis,\" he muttered. \"I thought it would be fun--sport. I thought we'd\nput on space suits and go out and make a kill. I thought--\"\n\n\"The space suits are ready. Do you want to try it?\"\n\nHe shuddered, his hanging jowls almost flapping. \"You couldn't drag me out\nthere.\"\n\n\nThe stuff is getting thicker in the ship.\n\n\nJane came into my cabin. She had an odd look on her face. She said,\n\"There's a big tiger in the companionway.\"\n\nI got up from my bunk and suddenly she seemed to realize what she'd\nsaid. She repeated it. Then she fell down in a faint. I put her in my\nbunk and looked out into the companionway. The sparkling fog glittered\nbut there was no tiger.\n\nWhen she came to, she didn't seem to know where she was. Then she\nsmiled. \"I must have been drinking too much,\" she said. Then she\nrealized where she was. \"But look where it got me? Into your bunk.\"\n\n\"Do you feel all right now?\"\n\n\"I guess so. I can get up now. I _do_ have to get up, don't I?\"\n\n\"I think you'd better.\"\n\nAfter she left I did some thinking. The sparkling haze had been\noutside the ship and I'd seen a water buffalo through the port. Murdo\nhad seen a boa-constrictor. Then the haze penetrated the hull and got\ninside the ship. And Jane had seen a tiger in the companionway.\n\nWere they phantoms? Was Jane's tiger a tiger of the mind? Murdo swore\nhis snake had been real and my buffalo left a mark on the port. I sat\nthere trying to think. With the sparkling fog drifting around me. It\nseemed to be trying to tell me something.\n\n\nThings grow worse. Today, at mess, Murdo was holding forth about a\nPlutonian ice bear he'd killed. I think he was trying to cover the\ngloom that has settled over us. Anyhow, he'd just got to the point\nwhere the bear was charging down on him when we heard the roar of\nthunder from outside. Maybe I'd better repeat that for the record. _We\nheard a roaring through the walls of the space ship. In the void._\nNothing goes through the walls of a space ship in the void but we all\nheard it and jumped to the port. And we all saw it.\n\nAn ice bear as big as ten of the largest that ever lived in the\nPlutonian ice flows. A huge ravening beast that rushed through the\nvoid at the ship and tried to tear the port out of its metal seat with\nteeth as big as the height of a man.\n\nThe women fell back, screaming. Keebler, in his usual stupor stared\nblankly as though not realizing what was going on. Kelvey looked to\nMurdo for guidance. When none came he crouched behind a chair.\n\nMurdo fell back slowly, step by step as though his eyes were fastened\nto the quartz and it was hard to pull away. I don't remember what I\ndid. Murdo was saying \"My God--my God--my God,\" as though chanting a\nritual. He tore his eyes from the sight and looked at me.\n\n\"You wanted big game, buster,\" I croaked. \"There it is.\"\n\n\"But it can't be real. It _can't_!\"\n\n\"Maybe not, but if that port gives I'll bet it won't be from vacuum\npressure.\"\n\n\"Vacuum draws. It doesn't press,\" Kelvey babbled inanely, but nobody\npaid any attention to him.\n\nThe beast made two more charges on the ship, then drew back screaming\nin rage from a snapped tooth. And all around us, there in the ship,\nthe sparkling fog glittered and tried to talk.\n\n\nTwo hours. The beast still rages in the void outside our ship.\n\n\n\nJane is dead. She was horribly mangled. I put her in her bunk and laid\na blanket over her and now the blanket is soaked in her blood.\n\nNo one could have helped her. It happened in the lounge. She was in\nthere alone. I was in the control room. I don't know where the rest\nwere.\n\nI was working uselessly with the controls when I heard a terrible\nscream mixed with a hideous snarling. I ran into the companionway and\nstared toward the lounge. Murdo appeared from somewhere and we were\nshouldering each other on the companion ladder. Murdo fell heavily.\nThen we were both looking into the lounge.\n\nIt was too late to help Jane. We saw her there, still and bloody. A\nshiny black leopard was crouching gory-mouthed over her body with its\npaws on her breast. It's eyes were black magnets, holding mine.\n\nI said, \"Get a gun,\" trying to speak without moving my lips.\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Damn you--get a gun!\"\n\nMurdo staggered away. It seemed a year before he came back with a\nHinzie Special .442. The leopard was tight, ready to spring. I didn't\ndare move a muscle. I said, \"Over my shoulder. Get him. Don't miss.\"\n\nThat last was a little silly. How could a man miss with a Hinzie at\nten feet? Murdo fired and tore the leopard's head off. It was down\nalready so it didn't move. It sat there headless, its tail twitching\nslightly. Then it was still.\n\nI didn't hesitate this time. I said, \"Come on. We've got to get this\nout of here before the others show.\"\n\nWe put the dead leopard into the forward storage bunker. Then I picked\nup poor Jane and carried her to her room. Murdo helped me up the\nladder. The others were in the companionway and they pressed back in\nhorror to let me pass. For the first time since we'd started, Keebler\nwas sober. Ashen, shaking, stone sober. He broke; screamed and ran for\nhis bottle, the world of reality too terrible for him to bear.\n\nThere was no huddle, no conference, no meeting of the minds. Everyone\nelse went to the galley and sat staring into space; stared at the\ndancing little sparkles in the air.\n\nI went to my cabin.\n\n\nWhen confronted by a reality no matter how crazy and improbable, a man\nmust not turn from it. He can not carry the mangled body of a woman in\nhis arms and then say to himself: _This isn't real because it doesn't\nmake sense._ It _does_ make sense--some kind of sense or it would not\nexist. A man must say rather: _I don't understand this and maybe I\nnever will but God gave me a brain and I must try. I can't sit back\nand deny reality. I must try to understand it._ I cleared my mind and\ntried to rationalize the things around us.\n\nOut in the darkness there was a terrible roaring and yammering. The\nthuds and bellows of violence. I went to the port.\n\nThere, in the light from the ship, the ice bear and the water buffalo\nwere fighting. It was a terrible and magnificent thing but to me it\nwas anticlimax; a sideshow of almost casual interest.\n\nThe ice bear outsized the water buff by too much to be in any danger,\nbut the buff fought savagely and the ice bear had no easy time. The\nbuff opened a long deep gash in the bear's throat when the bear missed\na lunge and the Plutonian mammal fell back with a roar of pain and\nfury. They came together again and this time the bear got the buff in\na hug and it was all over. The buff's spine broke and the bear bent\nthe body double, then tore it to pieces. I wondered if the others were\nwatching.\n\nI went back to pacing; back to my thinking.\n\nI have been thinking, thinking, thinking; wracking my brain. And of\none thing I am sure. Some invisible intelligence is trying to help me;\ntrying to give me knowledge. The sparkling fog?\n\n\n\nA great and wonderful thing has happened.\n\n_And I know._ Do you realize what that means? To know in a situation\nlike this? And to be wonderfully and wildly happy? The knowledge was\nnot all given me. There was a thought process of my own developing.\nThe thing given me was the basic knowledge upon which to build. And\nproof of this knowledge. Absolute and indisputable proof.\n\n_The sparkling fog is mind stuff._\n\nI will not defend that statement. I will not rationalize it. But I\nwill seek explanations; consider possibilities.\n\nKnown: This sparkling fog through which we drift is intelligent\nmatter; the stuff of thoughts; the basic material from which\nconsciousness springs. It is consciousness itself.\n\nSupposed: It is probably electronuclear in composition, and appears to\nbe completely innocent. By that I mean it has no intention to harm,\nperhaps because it does not understand the difference between good and\nevil, harm and help, pain and pleasure.\n\nIt has only one urge; the basic urge of all creation. To evolve, to\ndevelop. As the tree has but one basic urge--to grow and greaten; the\nflower but one desire--to bloom, to improve; to assert itself through\nevolution and become better.\n\nPerhaps--and who can successfully deny it?--this great space cloud\ncould be a storage place of the Creator Himself; a storage place for\nmind stuff. When an infant or an animal or a plant is touched with the\nmagic thing called life--where does that magic come from? Is it\ncreated at the very moment or does it come somehow from a source-pile?\nIs this cloud a source-pile of life itself? No one can say. But I\nthink I've hit on a limitation of this mind stuff. I'm going to try an\nexperiment and pray to God it works.\n\nI'm going to find Murdo and knock him unconscious.\n\n\nI have solved the mind-stuff. What just happened is the last bit of\nproof I need. I went to the galley. Murdo had wandered away. I found\nhim in the lounge. I stepped casually in front of him, set myself, and\ndrove a straight right to his jaw. He went down like a log.\n\nI closed my eyes and counted to twenty praying to God to make me right\nin my belief--in the crazy theory I evolved. I opened my eyes and\nturned to the storage locker. I looked inside.\n\nThe dead leopard was gone.\n\nI went to the port and looked out. The huge ice bear had been ravening\ninsanely among the shreds of the water buffalo's body. As I watched\nboth bear and buff began fading.\n\nBefore my eyes, they disappeared, evolved back into the stuff of the\nsparkling fog. I had proved my theory.\n\nNow all the parts dropped into place. The mind stuff has only the\nability and the urge to evolve--nothing else--no imagination. It can\nevolve only if given something to reproduce.\n\nThis it can get only from a human mind. It is able to see an image\npictured in the human memory and reproduce it in a state of absolute\nreality.\n\nWitness: Jane saw a tiger in the companionway. Clear in her memory was\nthe image of the tiger she had shot at in India. The mind-stuff saw it\nand reproduced it in reality. The water buffalo came from my own mind.\nI killed one exactly like it a year ago. The ice bear was out of\nMurdo's memory as was the black leopard and the snake.\n\nWitness: The three animals created inside the ship did not appear\nuntil the mind stuff from outside penetrated the hull and entered the\nship. They were of normal size. But the animals created outside the\nship were far out of proportion, the ice bear especially. Why?\nBecause, I believe, the mind stuff is denser in the void. There it has\nmore strength.\n\nMy defense against the mind stuff was formulated almost accidentally.\nI remembered the sequence of Jane's tiger. She saw it, entered my\ncabin, realized its significance, and fainted. I looked into the\ncompanionway and saw the tiger fading.\n\nSo I knocked out Murdo for final proof and got it. As soon as he\nlapsed into unconsciousness the recreations from his mind turned back\ninto sparkling fog. Obviously, and a heaven-sent phenomenon it is--the\nmind stuff immediately loses its subject-image when the mind from\nwhich it came goes unconscious. The mind-stuff has no memory of its\nown and cannot hold its recreated image in the evolved form under\nconditions of unconsciousness. The answer now becomes simple.\n\n\nI drugged Murdo before he regained consciousness. I drugged the other\nthree by means of whisky and food. They have been unconscious for\ntwelve hours. Nothing has happened. I shall keep them that way.\n\n\nThe mind-stuff is trying to complain to me. Almost petulantly; as a\nchild. I sense it sharply. It does not understand the wrong it has\ndone and feels it has been deprived of its right.\n\n\nI have no time for the mind-stuff. I guard myself against it and\nignore it. There are other things on my mind. Shall I go back if we\never escape from the sparkling fog? I don't know. I don't want to go\nback. I want to go on and on forever just like this. But the others\ncannot go on like this. It would be murder. I don't know.--I don't\nknow.\n\n\nI must keep awake. I use drugs. I must not sleep--not sleep.\n\n\nWe have cleared the fog. The instruments are working again. Again the\nstars glow. What shall I do. _Melody...._\n\n\n\n_Kennedy_ looked up from his reading. \"As I said,\"--and he spoke\nseverely--\"you break off at an abrupt point. You did not complete the\nlog.\"\n\nHolloway's red eyes were glazed. \"I had other things to do. I was\ntired of keeping a log.\"\n\nMason sought to draw Kennedy off his quarry. \"There's an odd point,\"\nhe said, looking at Holloway. \"Only animals were recreated. Do you\nthink the mind stuff was capable only of recreating animals?\"\n\nHolloway spoke in an exhausted monotone. \"It took the clearest image\nfrom the strongest minds. Murdo thought mainly of hunting. He\npondered on his more spectacular kills. Thus the mind-stuff used his\nimages.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nHolloway seemed to sag--to shrink. He said, \"The mind-stuff could\nrecreate anything. It brought Melody back to me.\"\n\nKennedy sprang to his feet. \"There is no reference in this log to--\"\n\nMason turned on him. \"Shut up, you fool!\" He laid a gentle hand on\nHolloway's shoulder. \"Tell us about it, old chap.\"\n\nHolloway turned his burning eyes on the closed door to the next room.\n\"She's in there. I wanted to get rid of you. I was afraid you would\ntake her away from me. But it's no use. I can't hold my consciousness\nmuch longer. Then she will vanish.\"\n\nHolloway tried weakly to rise from his chair. He called,\n\"Melody--Melody baby!\"\n\nThe door opened. A beautiful girl in a blue dressing gown came\ngracefully into the room. She walked straight to Holloway and took his\ntortured head into her soft hands. Her eyes pleaded with the men. \"He\nsuffers so. He will not sleep. I can't make him sleep. I--I don't\nunderstand.\"\n\nHolloway's head dropped suddenly onto his chest. He slumped down in\nhis chair. And as he did so, a change took place. The two men stood\nrooted, staring.\n\nAs Melody began to fade. Slowly, slowly, into a transparent image,\ninto a mist, into a handful of sparkling fog.\n\nThen she was gone.\n\nMason knelt by the bone-thin body in the chair. He made a quick\nexamination and got wearily to his feet.\n\n\"Holloway is dead,\" he murmured. \"Drugs of that nature would kill an\nelephant. I can't understand how he lived so long.\"\n\nKennedy blinked and seemed to come out of a trance. He frowned. \"And\nthe investigation hardly started.\"\n\nMason shook his head and looked pityingly at Kennedy. It was just no\nuse with a man like him. Mason said. \"There's one point entirely\napparent without an investigation.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\nMason's voice was sharp and cold. \"That our little playboy, for all\nhis reputation of frivolity, was a better man than you and I put\ntogether. Does that register, Mr. Kennedy?\"\n\nKennedy flared. \"Now see here. I'm only doing my job!\"\n\n\"Oh shut up,\" Mason said.\n\nAnd strode out of the room.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
