Then he recoiled.\n\n\"What is incorrect about me, then?\" the stranger demanded. \"Do I not\nhave two eyes, one nose and one mouth, the identical as other people?\"\n\nPaul studied the other man. \"Yes, but somehow they seem to be put\ntogether all wrong. Not that you can help it, of course,\" he added\napologetically, for, when he thought of it, he hated to hurt people's\nfeelings.\n\n\"Yes, I can, for, of a truth, 'twas I who put myself together. What did\nI do amiss?\"\n\nPaul looked consideringly at him. \"I can't quite put my finger on it,\nbut there are certain subtle nuances you just don't seem to have caught.\nIf you want my professional advice, you'll model yourself directly on\nsome real person until you've got the knack of improvisation.\"\n\n\"Like unto this?\" The stranger's outline shimmered and blurred into an\namorphous cloud, which then coalesced into the shape of a tall,\nbeautiful young man with the face of an ingenuous demon. \"Behold, is\nthat superior?\"\n\n\"Oh, far superior!\" Paul reached up to adjust a stray lock of hair, then\nrealized he was not looking into a mirror. \"Trouble is--well, I'd rather\nyou chose someone else to model yourself on. You see, in my profession,\nit's important to look as unique as possible; helps people remember you.\nI'm an actor, you know. Currently I happen to be at liberty, but the\nyear before last--\"\n\n\"Well, whom should I appear like? Should I perhaps pick some fine\nupstanding figure from your public prints to emulate? Like your\nPresident, perhaply?\"\n\n\"I--hardly think so. It wouldn't do to model yourself on someone well\nknown--or even someone obscure whom you might just happen to run into\nsomeday.\" Being a kind-hearted young man, Paul added, \"Come up to my\nroom. I have some British film magazines and there are lots of\nrelatively obscure English actors who are very decent-looking chaps.\"\n\n\n\nSo they climbed up to Paul's hot little room under the eaves and, after\nleafing through several magazines, Paul chose one Ivo Darcy as a likely\ncandidate. Whereupon the stranger deliquesced and reformed into the\npersonable simulacrum of young Mr. Darcy.\n\n\"That's quite a trick,\" Paul observed as it finally got through to him\nwhat the other had done. \"It would come in handy in the profession--for\ncharacter parts, you know.\"\n\n\"I fear you would never be able to acquisition it,\" the stranger said,\nsurveying his new self in the mirror complacently. \"It is not a trick\nbut a racial ableness. You see, I feel I can trust you--\"\n\n\"--Of course I'm not really a character actor; I'm a leading man, but I\nbelieve one should be versatile, because there are times when a really\ngood character part comes along--\"\n\n\"--I am not a human being. I am a native of the fifth planet circulating\naround the star you call Sirius, and we Sirians have the ableness to\nchange ourselves into the apparition of any other livid form--\"\n\n\"I thought that might be a near-Eastern accent!\" Paul exclaimed,\ndiverted. \"Is Lebanese anything like it? Because I understand there's a\nreally juicy part coming up in--\"\n\n\"I said _Sirian_, not _Syrian_; I do not come from Minor Asia but from\nouter space, from an other-where solar system. I am an outworlder, an\nextraterrestrial.\"\n\n\"I hope you had a nice trip,\" Paul said politely. \"From Sirius, did you\nsay? What's the state of the theater there?\"\n\n\"In its infanticide,\" the stranger told him, \"but--\"\n\n\"Let's face it,\" Paul muttered bitterly, \"it's in its infancy here, too.\nNo over-all planning. No appreciation of the fact that all the\ncomponents that go to make up a production should be a continuing\ntotality, instead of a tenuous coalition of separate forces which\ndisintegrate--\"\n\n\"You, I comprehend, are disemployed at current. I should--\"\n\n\"You won't find that situation in Russia!\" Paul went on, pleased to\ndiscover a sympathetic audience in this intelligent foreigner. \"Mind\nyou,\" he added quickly, \"I disapprove entirely of their politics. In\nfact, I disapprove of all politics. But when it comes to the theater, in\nmany respects the Russians--\"\n\n\"--Like to make a proposal to our mutual advanceage--\"\n\n\"--You wouldn't find an actor there playing a lead role one season and\nthen not be able to get any parts except summer stock and odd bits for\nthe next two years. All right, so the show I had the lead in folded\nafter two weeks, but the critics all raved about my performance. It was\nthe play that stank!\"\n\n\"Will you terminate the monologue and hearken unto me!\" the alien\nshouted.\n\nPaul stopped talking. His feelings were hurt. He had thought Ivo liked\nhim; now he saw all the outworlder wanted to do was talk about his own\nproblems.\n\n\"I desire to extend to you a position,\" said Ivo.\n\n\"I can't take a regular job,\" Paul said sulkily. \"I have to be available\nfor interviews. Fellow I knew took a job in a store and, when he was\ncalled to read for a part, he couldn't get away. The fellow who did get\nthat part became a big star, and maybe the other fellow could have been\na star, too, but now all he is is a lousy chairman of the board of some\ndepartment store chain--\"\n\n\"This work can be undergone at your convention between readings and\ninterviews, whenever you have the timing. I shall pay you beautifully,\nbeing abundant with U.S.A. currency. I want you to teach me how to act.\"\n\n\"Teach you how to act,\" Paul repeated, rather intrigued. \"Well, I'm not\na dramatic coach, you know; however, I do happen to have some ideas on\nthe subject. I feel that most acting teachers nowadays fail to give\ntheir students a really thorough grounding in all aspects of the\ndramatic art. All they talk about is method, method, method. But what\nabout technique?\"\n\n\"I have observed your species with great diligence and I thought I had\nacquisitioned your habits and speakings to perfectness. But I fear that,\nlike my initial face, I have got them awry. I want you to teach me to\nact like a human being, to talk like a human being, to think like a\nhuman being.\"\n\nPaul's attention was really caught. \"Well, that _is_ a challenge! I\ndon't suppose Stanislavsky ever had to teach an extraterrestrial, or\neven Strasberg--\"\n\n\"Then we are in accordance,\" Ivo said. \"You will instruction me?\" He\nessayed a smile.\n\nPaul shuddered. \"Very well,\" he said. \"We'll start now. And I think the\nfirst thing we'd better start with is lessons in smiling.\"\n\nIvo proved to be a quick study. He not only learned to smile, but to\nfrown and to express surprise, pleasure, horror--whatever the occasion\ndemanded. He learned the knack of counterfeiting humanity with such\nskill that, Paul was moved to remark one afternoon when they were\nleaving Brooks Brothers after a fitting, \"Sometimes you seem even more\nhuman than I do, Ivo. I wish you'd watch out for that tendency to rant,\nthough. You're supposed to speak, not make speeches.\"\n\n\"I try not to,\" Ivo said, \"but I keep getting carried away by\nenthusiasm.\"\n\n\"Apparently I have a real flair for teaching,\" Paul went on as, expertly\ncamouflaged by Brooks, the two young men melted into the dense\ncharcoal-gray underbrush of Madison Avenue. \"I seem to be even more\nversatile than I thought. Perhaps I have been--well, not wasting but\nlimiting my talents.\"\n\n\"That may be because your talents have not been sufficiently\nappreciated,\" his star pupil suggested, \"or given enough scope.\"\n\nIvo was so perceptive! \"As a matter of fact,\" Paul agreed, \"it has often\nseemed to me that if some really gifted individual, equally adept at\nacting, directing, producing, playwriting, teaching, et al., were to\nundertake a thorough synthesis of the theater--ah, but that would cost\nmoney,\" he interrupted himself, \"and who would underwrite such a\nproject? Certainly not the government of the United States.\" He gave a\nbitter laugh.\n\n\"Perhaps, under a new regime, conditions might be more favorable for the\nartist--\"\n\n\"Shhh!\" Paul looked nervously over his shoulder. \"There are Senators\neverywhere. Besides, I never said things were _good_ in Russia, just\n_better_--for the actor, that is. Of course the plays are atrocious\npropaganda--\"\n\n\"I was not referring to another human regime. The human being is, at\nbest, save for certain choice spirits, unsympathetic to the arts. We\noutworlders have a far greater respect for things of the mind.\"\n\nPaul opened his mouth; Ivo continued without giving him a chance to\nspeak, \"No doubt you have often wondered just what I am doing here on\nEarth?\"\n\nThe question had never crossed Paul's mind. Feeling vaguely guilty, he\nmurmured, \"Some people have funny ideas of where to go for a vacation.\"\n\n\"I am here on business,\" Ivo told him. \"The situation on Sirius is\nserious.\"\n\n\"You know, that's catchy! 'The situation on Sirius is serious',\" Paul\nrepeated, tapping his foot. \"I've often thought of trying my hand at a\nmusical com--\"\n\n\"I mean we have had a ser--grave population problem for the last couple\nof centuries, hence our government has sent out scouts to look for other\nplanets with similar atmosphere, climate, gravity and so on, where we\ncan ship our excess population. So far, we have found very few.\"\n\nWhen Paul's attention was focused, he could be as quick as anybody to\nput two and two together. \"But Earth is already occupied. In fact, when\nI was in school, I heard something about our having a population problem\nourselves.\"\n\n\"The other planets we already--ah--took over were in a similar state,\"\nIvo explained. \"We managed to surmount that difficulty.\"\n\n\"How?\" Paul asked, though he already suspected the answer.\n\n\"Oh, we didn't dispose of _all_ of the inhabitants. We merely weeded out\nthe undesirables--who, by fortunate chance, happened to be in the\nmajority--and achieved a happy and peaceful coexistence with the rest.\"\n\n\"But, look,\" Paul protested. \"I mean to say----\"\n\n\"For instance,\" Ivo said suavely, \"take the vast body of people who\nwatch television and who have never seen a legitimate play in their\nlives and, indeed, rarely go to the motion pictures. Surely they are\nexpendable.\"\n\n\"Well, yes, of course. But even among them there might be--oh, say, a\nplaywright's mother--\"\n\n\"One of the first measures our regime would take would be to establish a\nvast network of community theaters throughout the world. And you, Paul,\nwould receive first choice of starring roles.\"\n\n\"Now wait a minute!\" Paul cried hotly. He seldom allowed himself to lose\nhis temper, but when he did ... he got _angry_! \"I pride myself that\nI've gotten this far wholly on my own merits. I don't believe in using\ninfluence to--\"\n\n\"But, my dear fellow, all I meant was that, with an intelligently\ncoordinated theater and an intellectually adult audience, your abilities\nwould be recognized automatically.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Paul.\n\nHe was not unaware that he was being flattered, but it was so seldom\nthat anyone bothered to pay him any attention when he was not playing a\nrole that it was difficult not to succumb. \"Are--are you figuring on\ntaking over the planet single-handed?\" he asked curiously.\n\n\"Heavens, no! Talented as I am, there are limits. I don't do\nthe--ah--dirty work myself. I just conduct the preliminary investigation\nto determine how powerful the local defenses are.\"\n\n\"We have hydrogen bombs,\" Paul said, trying to remember details of a\nnewspaper article he had once read in a producer's ante-room, \"and\nplutonium bombs and--\"\n\n\"Oh, I know about all those,\" Ivo smiled expertly. \"My job is checking\nto make sure you don't have anything really dangerous.\"\n\nAll that night, Paul wrestled with his conscience. He knew he shouldn't\njust let Ivo go on. Yet what else could he do? Go to the proper\nauthorities? But which authorities were the proper ones? And even if he\nfound them, who would believe an actor offstage, delivering such\nimprobable lines? He would either be laughed at or accused of being part\nof a subversive plot. It might result in a lot of bad publicity which\ncould ruin his career.\n\nSo Paul did nothing about Ivo. He went back to the usual rounds of\nagents' and producers' offices, and the knowledge of why Ivo was on\nEarth got pushed farther into the back of his mind as he trudged from\ninterview to reading to interview.\n\nIt was an exceptionally hot October--the kind of weather when sometimes\nhe almost lost his faith and began to wonder why he was batting his head\nagainst a stone wall, why he didn't get a job in a department store\nsomewhere or teaching school. And then he thought of the applause, the\ncurtain calls, the dream of some day seeing his name in lights above the\ntitle of the play--and he knew he would never give up. Quitting the\ntheater would be like committing suicide, for off the stage he was alive\nonly technically. He was good; he knew he was good, so some day, he\nassured himself, he was bound to get his big break.\n\nToward the end of that month, it came. After the maximum three readings,\nbetween which his hopes alternately waxed and waned, he was cast as the\nmale lead in _The Holiday Tree_. The producers were more interested,\nthey said, in getting someone who fitted the role of Eric Everard than\nin a big name--especially since the female star preferred to have her\nluster undimmed by competition.\n\nRehearsals took up so much of his time that he saw very little of Ivo\nfor the next five weeks--but by then Ivo didn't need him any more.\nActually, they were no longer teacher and pupil now but companions,\ndrawn together by the fact that they both belonged to different worlds\nfrom the one in which they were living. Insofar as he could like anyone\nwho existed outside of his imagination, Paul had grown rather fond of\nIvo. And he rather thought Ivo liked him, too--but, because he couldn't\never be quite sure of ordinary people's reactions toward him, how could\nhe be sure of an outworlder's?\n\nIvo came around to rehearsals sometimes, but naturally it would be\nboring for him, since he wasn't in the profession, and, after a while,\nhe didn't come around very often. At first, Paul felt a twinge of guilt;\nthen he remembered that he need not worry. Ivo had his own work.\n\n\n\nThe whole _Holiday Tree_ troupe went out of town for the tryouts, and\nPaul didn't see Ivo at all for six weeks. Busy, happy weeks they were,\nfor the play was a smash hit from the start. It played to packed houses\nin New Haven and Boston, and the box office in New York was sold out for\nmonths in advance before they even opened.\n\n\"Must be kinda fun--acting,\" Ivo told Paul the morning after the New\nYork opening, as Paul weltered contentedly on his bed--he had the best\nroom in the house now--amid a pile of rave notices. At long last, he had\narrived. Everybody loved him. He was a success.\n\nAnd now that he had read the reviews and they were all favorable, he\ncould pay attention to the strange things that had happened to his\nfriend. Raising himself up on an elbow, Paul cried, \"Ivo, you're\n_mumbling_! After all I taught you about articulation!\"\n\n\"I got t'hanging 'round with this here buncha actors while y'were gone,\"\nIvo said. \"They say mumbling's the comin' thing. 'Sides, y'kept yapping\nthat I declaimed, so--\"\n\n\"But you don't have to go to the opposite extreme and--_Ivo_!\"\nIncredulously, Paul took in the full details of the other's appearance.\n\"What happened to your Brooks Brothers' suits?\"\n\n\"Hung 'em inna closet,\" Ivo replied, looking abashed. \"I did wear one\nlas' night, though,\" he went on defensively. \"Wooden come dressed like\nthis to y'opening. But all the other fellas wear blue jeans 'n leather\njackets. I mean, hell, I gotta conform more'n anybody. Y'know that,\nPaul.\"\n\n\"And--\" Paul sat bolt upright; this was the supreme outrage--\"you've\nchanged yourself! You've gotten _younger_!\"\n\n\"This is an age of yout',\" Ivo mumbled. \"An' I figured I was 'bout ready\nfor improvisation, like you said.\"\n\n\"Look, Ivo, if you really want to go on the stage----\"\n\n\"Hell, I don' wanna be no actor!\" Ivo protested, far too vehemently.\n\"Y'know damn' well I'm a--a spy, scoutin' 'round t'see if y'have any\nsecret defenses before I make m'report.\"\n\n\"I don't feel I'm giving away any government secrets,\" Paul said, \"when\nI tell you that the bastions of our defenses are not erected at the\nActors' Studio.\"\n\n\"Listen, pal, you lemme spy the way I wanna an' I'll letcha act the way\nyou wanna.\"\n\nPaul was disturbed by this change in Ivo because, although he had\nalways tried to steer clear of social involvement, he could not\nhelp feeling that the young alien had become in a measure his\nresponsibility--particularly now that he was a teen-ager. Paul would\neven have worried about Ivo, if there hadn't been so many other things\nto occupy his mind. First of all, the producers of _The Holiday Tree_\ncould not resist the pressure of an adoring public; although the\noriginal star sulked, three months after the play had opened in New\nYork, Paul's name went up in lights next to hers, _over the title of the\nplay. He was a star._\n\nThat was good. But then there was Gregory. And that was bad. Gregory was\nPaul's understudy--a handsome, sullen youth who had, on numerous\noccasions, been heard to utter words to the effect of: \"It's the part\nthat's so good, not him. If I had the chance to play Eric Everard just\nonce, they'd give Lambrequin back to the Indians.\"\n\nSometimes he had said the words in Paul's hearing; sometimes the remarks\nhad been lovingly passed on by fellow members of the cast who felt that\nPaul ought to know.\n\n\n\n\"I don't like that Gregory,\" Paul told Ivo one Monday evening as they\nwere enjoying a quiet smoke together, for there was no performance that\nnight. \"He used to be a juvenile delinquent, got sent to one of those\nreform schools where they use acting as therapy and it turned out to be\nhis _m\u00e9tier_. But you never know when that kind'll hear the call of the\nwild again.\"\n\n\"Aaaah, he's a good kid,\" Ivo said. \"He just never had a chanct.\"\n\n\"Trouble is, I'm afraid he's going to _make_ himself a chanct--chance,\nthat is.\"\n\n\"Aaaah,\" retorted Ivo, with prideful inarticulateness.\n\nHowever, when at six-thirty that Friday, Paul fell over a wire stretched\nbetween the jambs of the doorway leading to his private bathroom and\nbroke a leg, even Ivo was forced to admit that this did not look like an\naccident.\n\n\"Ivo,\" Paul wailed when the doctor had left, \"what am I going to do? I\nrefuse to let Gregory go on in my place tonight!\"\n\n\"Y'gonna hafta,\" Ivo said, shifting his gum to the other side of his\nmouth. \"He's y'unnastudy.\"\n\n\"But the doctor said it would be weeks before I can get around again.\nEither Gregory'll take over the part completely with his interpretation\nand I'll be left out in the cold, or more likely, he'll louse up the\nplay and it'll fold before I'm on my feet.\"\n\n\"Y'gotta have more confidence in y'self, kid. The public ain't gonna\nforgetcha in a few weeks.\"\n\nBut Paul knew far better than the idealistic Ivo how fickle the public\ncan be. However, he chose an argument that would appeal to the boy.\n\"Don't forget, he booby-trapped me!\"\n\n\"Cert'ny looks like it,\" Ivo was forced to concede. \"But watcha gonna\ndo? Y'can't prove it. 'Sides, the curtain's gonna gwup in a li'l over a\nnour--\"\n\nPaul gripped Ivo's sinewy wrist. \"Ivo, you've got to go on for me!\"\n\n\"Y'got rocks in y'head or somepin?\" Ivo demanded, trying not to look\npleased. \"I ain't gotta Nequity card, and even if I did, _he's_\ny'unnastudy.\"\n\n\"No, you don't understand. I don't want you to go on as Ivo Darcy\nplaying Eric Everard. I want you to go on as Paul Lambrequin playing\nEric Everard. _You can do it, Ivo!_\"\n\n\"Good Lord, so I can!\" Ivo whispered, temporarily neglecting to mumble.\n\"I'd almost forgotten.\"\n\n\"You know my lines, too. You've cued me in my part often enough.\"\n\nIvo rubbed his hand over his forehead. \"Yeah, I guess I do.\"\n\n\"Ivo,\" Paul beseeched him, \"I thought we were--pals. I don't want to ask\nany favors, but I helped you out when you were in trouble. I always\nfigured I could rely on you. I never thought you'd let me down.\"\n\n\"An' I won't.\" Ivo gripped Paul's hand. \"I'll go on t'night 'n play 'at\npart like it ain't never been played before! I'll--\"\n\n\"No! No! Play it the way I played it. You're supposed to be _me_, Ivo!\nForget Strasberg; go back to Stanislavsky.\"\n\n\"Okay, pal,\" Ivo said. \"Will do.\"\n\n\"And promise me one thing, Ivo. Promise me _you won't mumble_.\"\n\nIvo winced. \"Okay, but you're the on'y one I'd do 'at for.\"\n\nSlowly, he began to shimmer. Paul held his breath. Maybe Ivo had\nforgotten how to transmute himself. But technique triumphed over method.\nIvo Darcy gradually coalesced into the semblance of Paul Lambrequin. The\nshow would go on!\n\n\n\n\"Well, how was everything?\" Paul asked anxiously when Ivo came into his\nroom shortly after midnight.\n\n\"Pretty good,\" Ivo said, sitting down on the edge of the bed. \"Gregory\nwas extremely surprised to see me--asked me half a dozen times how I was\nfeeling.\" Ivo was not only articulating, Paul was gratified to notice;\nhe was enunciating.\n\n\"But the show--how did that go? Did anyone suspect you were a ringer?\"\n\n\"No,\" Ivo said slowly. \"No, I don't think so. I got twelve curtain\ncalls,\" he added, staring straight ahead of him with a dreamy smile.\n\"Twelve.\"\n\n\"Friday nights, the audience is always enthusiastic.\" Then Paul\nswallowed hard and said, \"Besides, I'm sure you were great in the role.\"\n\nBut Ivo didn't seem to hear him. Ivo was still wrapped in his golden\ndaze. \"Just before the curtain went up, I didn't think I was going to be\nable to do it. I began to feel all quivery inside, the way I do before\nI--I change.\"\n\n\"Butterflies in the stomach is the professional term.\" Paul nodded\nwisely. \"A really good actor gets them before every performance. No\nmatter how many times I play a role, there's that minute when the house\nlights start to dim when I'm in an absolute panic--\"\n\n\"--And then the curtain went up and I was all right. I was fine. I was\nPaul Lambrequin. I was Eric Everard. I was--everything.\"\n\n\"Ivo,\" Paul said, clapping him on the shoulder, \"you're a born trouper.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Ivo murmured, \"I'm beginning to think so myself.\"\n\nFor the next four weeks, Paul Lambrequin lurked in his room while Ivo\nDarcy played Paul Lambrequin playing Eric Everard.\n\n\"It's terrific of you to take all this time away from your duties, old\nchap,\" Paul said to Ivo one day between the matinee and the evening\nperformances. \"I really do appreciate it. Although I suppose you've\nmanaged to squeeze some of them in. I never see you on non-matinee\nafternoons.\"\n\n\"Duties?\" Ivo repeated vacantly. \"Yes, of course--my duties.\"\n\n\"Let me give you some professional advice, though. Be more careful when\nyou take off your makeup. There's still some grease paint in the roots\nof your hair.\"\n\n\"Sloppy of me,\" Ivo agreed, getting to work with a towel.\n\n\"I can't understand why you bother to put on the stuff at all,\" Paul\ngrinned, \"when all you need to do is just change a little more.\"\n\n\"I know.\" Ivo rubbed his temples vigorously. \"I suppose I just like\nthe--smell of the stuff.\"\n\n\"Ivo,\" Paul laughed, \"there's no use trying to kid me; you are\nstagestruck. I'm sure I have enough pull now to get you a bit part\nsomewhere, when I'm up and around again, and then you can get yourself\nan Equity card. Maybe,\" he added amusedly, \"I can even have you replace\nGregory as my understudy.\"\n\n\n\nLater, in retrospect, Paul thought perhaps there had been a curious\nexpression in Ivo's eyes, but right then he'd had no inkling that\nanything untoward was up. He did not find out what had been at the back\nof Ivo's mind until the Sunday before the Tuesday on which he was\nplanning to resume his role.\n\n\"Lord, it's going to be good to feel that stage under my feet again,\" he\nsaid as he went through a series of complicated limbering-up exercises\nof his own devisement, which he had sometimes thought of publishing as\n_The Lambrequin Time and Motion Studies_. It seemed unfair to keep them\nfrom other actors.\n\nIvo turned around from the mirror in which he had been contemplating\ntheir mutual beauty, \"Paul,\" he said quietly, \"you're never going to\nfeel that stage under your feet again.\"\n\nPaul sat on the floor and stared at him.\n\n\"You see, Paul,\" Ivo said, \"I am Paul Lambrequin now. I am more Paul\nLambrequin than I was--whoever I was on my native planet. I am more Paul\nLambrequin than _you_ ever were. You learned the part superficially,\nPaul, but I really _feel_ it.\"\n\n\"It's not a part,\" Paul said querulously. \"It's me. I've always been\nPaul Lambrequin.\"\n\n\"How can you be sure of that? You've had so many identities, why should\nthis be the true one? No, you only _think_ you're Paul Lambrequin. I\n_know_ I am.\"\n\n\"Dammit,\" Paul said, \"that's the identity in which I've taken out Equity\nmembership. And be reasonable, Ivo--there can't be two Paul\nLambrequins.\"\n\nIvo smiled sadly. \"No, Paul, you're right. There can't.\"\n\nOf course Paul had known all along that Ivo was not a human being. It\nwas only now, however, that full realization came to him of what a\nruthless alien monster the other was, existing only to gratify his own\npurposes, unaware that others had a right to exist.\n\n\"Are--are you going to--dispose of me, then?\" Paul asked faintly.\n\n\"To dispose of you, yes, Paul. But not to kill you. My kind has killed\nenough, conquered enough. We have no real population problem; that was\njust an excuse we made to salve our own consciences.\"\n\n\"You have consciences, do you?\" Paul's face twisted in a sneer that he\nhimself sensed right away was overly melodramatic and utterly\nunconvincing. Somehow, he could never be really genuine offstage.\n\nIvo made a sweeping gesture. \"Don't be bitter, Paul. Of course we do.\nAll intelligent life-forms do. It's one of the penalties of sentience!\"\n\nFor a moment, Paul forgot himself. \"Watch it, Ivo. You're beginning to\nham up your lines.\"\n\n\"We can institute birth control,\" Ivo went on, his manner subdued. \"We\ncan build taller buildings. Oh, there are many ways we can cope with the\npopulation increase. That's not the problem. The problem is how to\ndivert our creative energies from destruction to construction. And I\nthink I have solved it.\"\n\n\"How will your people know you have,\" Paul asked cunningly, \"since you\nsay you're not going back?\"\n\n\"_I_ am not going back to Sirius, Paul--_you_ are. It is you who are\ngoing to teach my people the art of peace to replace the art of war.\"\n\nPaul felt himself turn what was probably a very effective white.\n\"But--but I can't even speak the language! I--\"\n\n\"You will learn the language during the journey. I spent those\nafternoons I was away making a set of _Sirian-in-a-Jiffy_ records for\nyou. Sirian's a beautiful language, Paul, much more expressive than any\nof your Earth languages. You'll like it.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I shall, but--\"\n\n\"Paul, you are going to bring my people the outlet for self-expression\nthey have always needed. You see, I lied to you. The theater on Sirius\nis not in its infancy; it has never been conceived. If it had been, we\nwould never have become what we are today. Can you imagine--a race like\nmine, so superbly fitted to practice the dramatic art, remaining in\nblind ignorance that such an art exists!\"\n\n\"It does seem a terrible waste,\" Paul had to agree, although he could\nnot be truly sympathetic just then. \"But I am hardly equipped--\"\n\n\"Who is better equipped than you to meet this mighty challenge? Can't\nyou see that at long last you will be able to achieve your great\nsynthesis of the theatrical arts--as producer, teacher, director, actor,\nplaywright, whatever you will, working with a cast of individuals who\ncan assume any shape or form, who have no preconceived notions of what\ncan be done and what cannot. Oh, Paul, what a glorious opportunity\nawaits you on Sirius V. How I envy you!\"\n\n\"Then why don't you do it yourself?\" Paul asked.\n\nIvo smiled sadly again. \"Unfortunately, I do not have your manifold\nabilities. All I can do is act. Superbly, of course, but that's all. I\ndon't have the capacity to build a living theater from scratch. You do.\nI have talent, Paul, but you have genius.\"\n\n\"It _is_ a temptation,\" Paul admitted. \"But to leave my own world....\"\n\n\"Paul, Earth isn't your world. You carry yours along with you wherever\nyou go. Your world exists in the mind and heart, not in reality. In any\nreal situation, you're just as uncomfortable on Earth as you would be on\nSirius.\"\n\n\"Yes, but--\"\n\n\"Think of it this way, Paul. You're not leaving your world. You're just\nleaving Earth to go on the road. It's a longer road, but look at what's\nwaiting for you at the end of it.\"\n\n\"Yes, look,\" Paul said, reality very much to the fore in his mind and\nheart at that moment, \"death or vivisection.\"\n\n\"Paul, do you believe I'd do that to you?\" There were tears in Ivo's\neyes. If he was acting, he was a great performer. _I really am one hell\nof a good teacher_, Paul thought, _and with lots of raw material like\nIvo to work with, I could.... Could he really mean what he's saying_?\n\n\"They won't harm you, Paul, because you will come to Sirius bearing a\nmessage from me. You will tell my people that Earth has a powerful\ndefensive weapon and you have come to teach them its secret. And it's\ntrue, Paul. The theater is your world's most powerful weapon, its best\ndefense against the universal enemy--reality.\"\n\n\"Ivo,\" Paul said, \"you really must check that tendency toward bombast.\nEspecially with a purple speech like that; you've simply got to learn to\nunderplay. You'll watch out for that when I'm gone, won't you?\"\n\n\"I will!\" Ivo's face lighted up. \"Oh, I will, Paul. I promise never to\nchew the scenery again. I won't so much as nibble on a prop!\"\n\n\n\nThe next day, the two of them went up to Bear Mountain where Ivo's ship\nhad been cached all those months. Ivo explained to Paul how the controls\nworked and showed him where the clean towels were.\n\nPausing in the airlock, Paul looked back toward Manhattan. \"I'd dreamed\nso many years of seeing my name up in lights on Broadway,\" he murmured,\n\"and now, just when I made it--\"\n\n\"I'll keep it up there,\" Ivo vowed. \"I promise. And, meanwhile, you'll\nbe building a new Broadway up there in the stars!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Paul said dreamily, \"that is something to look forward to, isn't\nit?\" Fresh, enthusiastic audiences, performers untrammeled by tradition,\na cooperative government, unlimited funds--why, there was a whole\nwonderful new world opening up before him.\n\n\"--In another ten years or so,\" Ivo was saying, \"Sirian actors will be\ncoming to Earth in droves, making the native performers look sick--\"\n\nPaul smiled wisely. \"Now, Ivo, you know Equity would never stand for\n_that_.\"\n\n\"Equity won't be able to help itself. Public pressure will surge upward\nin a mounting wave and--\" Ivo stopped. \"Sorry. I was ranting again,\nwasn't I? It's being out in the open air that does it. I need to be\nbounded by the four walls of a theater.\"\n\n\"That's a fallacy,\" Paul began. \"On the Greek stage--\"\n\n\"Save that for the stars, fella,\" Ivo smiled. \"You've got to leave\nbefore it gets light.\" Then he wrung Paul's hand. \"Good-by, kid,\" he\nsaid. \"You'll knock 'em dead on Sirius.\"\n\n\"Good-by, Ivo.\" Paul returned the grip. Then he got inside and closed\nthe airlock door behind him. He did hope Ivo would correct that tendency\ntoward declamation; on the other hand, it was certainly better than\nmumbling.\n\nPaul put a _Sirian-in-a-jiffy_ record on the turntable, because he might\nas well start learning the language right away. Of course he'd have no\none to talk to but himself for many months, but then, when all was said\nand done, he was his own favorite audience. He strapped himself into the\nacceleration couch and prepared for take-off.\n\n\"Next week, _East Lynne_,\" he said to himself.\n\n\n\n\n",
