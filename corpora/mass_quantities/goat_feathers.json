We seem to\nbe born liars in that particular, all of us, and I am no different.\nI'm starting out now to tell the bitter, agonizing truth about\nmyself, but before I am through I shall probably be lying at the\nrate of a mile a minute and cracking myself up something awful! A\nman can tell only so much truth; then he begins to wabble.\n\nThe truth is, I ought to be making as much money as Robert W.\nChambers, and winning prizes of honor like Ernest Poole, and I'm\nnot. I ought to be better known as a humorist than George Ade and\nMark Twain rolled into one, and I'm not. The trouble with me is\nthat I am always too ready and eager to break away and go gathering\ngoat-feathers. If it had not been for that I might be a millionaire\nor the President of the United States or the leading American\nAuthor, bound in Red Russia leather. I might have been a Set of\nBooks, like Sir Walter Scott or Dickens or Balzac, and when people\npassed my house the natives would say, \"No, that isn't the city\nhall or the court-house; that's where Butler lives.\" Of course some\nstrangers would say, \"Butler, the grocer?\" but that would be the\nignorant few. The real people would whisper, \"Butler, the Author!\"\nin a sort of subdued awe and remove their hats. Some of them would\npick a blade of grass from my lawn and take it home to hand down to\ntheir children's children as the most treasured family possession.\nAs it is, I have gathered so many goat-feathers that half the\npeople introduce me as Ellis Butler Parker and the other half as\nButler Parker Ellis, and if there is a ton of hay growing on my\nlawn nobody bothers to pick a pint. My father has to cut it and\nrake it away.\n\nGoat-feathers, you understand, are the feathers a man picks and\nsticks all over his hide to make himself look like the village\ngoat. It often takes six days, three hours and eighteen minutes to\ngather one goat-feather, and when a man has it and takes it home it\nis about as useful and valuable to him as a stone-bruise on the\nback of his neck. I have recently spent several days over a month\ngathering one goat-feather, and as a reward I was grabbed and\nchased after another that ate up two weeks and three days of my\ntime. Goat-feathers are the distractions, side lines and\ndeflections that take a man's attention from his own business and\nkeep him from getting ahead. They are the Greatest Thing in the\nWorld--to make a man look like a goat.\n\nI think I can claim, without fear of dispute, to have gathered more\ngoat-feathers in a fifty-year career, and to look more like a goat,\nthan any other man living, and not excepting Pooh Bah, who added\nsuch a pleasing, goat-like character to Gilbert-and-Sullivan's\n\"Mikado.\" Pooh Bah, poor amateur! could boast only that he was\nFirst Lord of the Treasury, Lord Chief Justice, Commander-in-Chief,\nLord High Admiral, Master of the Buck Hounds, Groom of the Back\nStairs, Archbishop of Titipu, Lord Mayor, Lord Chamberlain,\nAttorney-General, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Privy Purse, Private\nSecretary, Lord High Auditor, First Commissioner of Police,\nPaymaster General, Judge Ordinary, Master of the Rolls, Secretary\nof State for the Home Department, Groom of the Second Floor Front,\nand Registrar. I can beat that all to pieces.\n\nWhen I wake in the morning as President of the Authors' League Fund\nI can give some attention to my work as Publicity Manager of the\nLiberty Loan Committee while preparing to devote an hour or two to\nthe Secretaryship of the Armenian Relief and the Treasurership of\nthe Volunteer Committee for the Fatherless Children of France,\nbefore I consider my duties as Vice-President of the Flushing\nSavings and Loan and as Vice-President, Director and Member of the\nDiscount Committee of the Flushing National Bank. As a Councillor\nand Member of the Executive Committee of the Authors' League, and\none of the Membership Committee of the City Club, Governor of the\nTuscarora Club and Publicity Manager for the Flushing Red Cross,\nFlushing Red Cross Drive and Queensboro Red Cross Drive I can put\nin a few hours of goat-feather gathering. Night may come without my\nhaving to do any real work, but if not I can avoid it and\naccumulate a few more goat-feathers as Member of the Book Committee\nand Executive Committee of the Queensboro Public Library, Member of\nthe Queensboro Committee on Training Camp Activities, Executive\nCommitteeman of the Vigilantes, Authors' Committeeman of the\nAmerican Defense Society, and so on for hours and hours and hours.\nI am a member of everything but the Mothers' Club of Public School\n20, and everything takes time from my legitimate work. I estimate\nthat in the last twenty years I have gathered twenty thousand\npounds of goat-feathers at a cost of about five dollars a pound,\nand the whole lot is worth about twenty cents.\n\nWhat I marvel at is that I make a living at all. My telephone rings\nseven thousand eight hundred and six times a day, and only once in\nthe last eight years has it been rung by any one who wanted to buy\na story from me. The other eighty-two million times it was rung by\npeople who wanted me to gather a new crop of goat-feathers.\n\nAt one time I moved out to the barn to get away from the telephone.\nThe result was that I had to come down out of the second story of\nthe barn, walk across my property, enter the house, and go upstairs\nevery time the telephone rang. I did this eighty-two times a day,\nand then moved back to the house and had an extension telephone put\nin my workroom so close to my desk that every time I flexed a\nmuscle I knocked the 'phone off its table. This made it much\nhandier for the goat-feather distributers, so they called me up\noftener. They call me before I am out of bed, when I am in the\nbathtub, and after I go to bed. Usually they call me to the 'phone\nand then tell me to wait a minute until Mr. Jonesky comes. The\nfavorite times for calling me are when I am in the bathtub, when I\nam at meals, and when I am trying to concentrate on my writing.\n\nI am not blaming any one for this. I did not have to rent a\ntelephone. I could have let people come to the house. A great many\ndo come to the house. On the average, it takes the person who comes\nto the house just one hour to state a proposition that could be put\nin a six-word telegram or 'phoned in one minute. The visitor always\nbegins with a few neat remarks about \"Pigs and Pigs,\" which is not\nthe name of the story, tells how his grandmother laughed over it\nuntil she swallowed her false teeth, explains that his grandmother\nwas one of the Tootlecoms of Worcester, but married into the\nBlahblah family. About half an hour later the visitor remarks, \"I\nknow you are very busy and I hate to ask you, but----\" Then he asks\nme to do some little trifle like raising $80,000,000 in Flushing\nfor the War Fund of the One-Legged Gardeners' League, which has a\nplan for planting sweet peas in the trenches in Mesopotamia. \"We\nknow you can do it,\" he says pleasantly. I know I can do it, too. I\nfeel the great urge of ability rise within me. I don't care a hang\nfor Mesopotamia, or for sweet peas in the trenches there; but it is\nsomething I can do, and I go ahead and do it. I gather two quarts\nof red, white, and blue goat-feathers, give eighteen magazine\neditors a chance to forget I am alive, and find at the end of the\nmonth that I am three hundred and forty dollars deeper in debt than\nI was before.\n\nIt has come about that people are actually offended if I don't jump\ninto every mad goat-feather quest that is proposed. I am firmly\nconvinced that there is now extant an Association to Prevent Butler\nDoing a Full Day's Work. I don't want to seem egotistical, but I am\nnow of the opinion that the Kaiser started the war in order to make\nit seem necessary for me to make Four-Minute speeches on Food\nConservation, Give Your Binoculars, and Buy a Thrift Stamp.\n\nOf course, all our patriotic, Liberty Loan, Red Cross, Thrift Stamp\nside-lining isn't goat-feathering. The genuine variety is\neagle-feather gathering, and I am as proud of my eagle-feathers as\nI am sour on my goat-feathers.\n\nNow it is a fine thing to be treasurer of the Flushing Hospital,\nand it is a fine thing to be president of the Flushing Country\nClub, but the goat-feathers pall when you know that the reason you\nwere given those glories was because nobody else would take them.\nIt's a \"grand and glorious feelin'\" to know you can take some\naffair and make it a success, or a near-success; but it is not\nbusiness. A man may make a success of a Flushing Public Playground\nand not be making a success of himself. He may be making a goat of\nhimself. The chances are ten to one that he is making a goat of\nhimself.\n\nI'll never get the Pulitzer prize for the best novel or for the\nbest play, but if there was a Pulitzer prize for the greatest human\ngoat nobody else would be in the running. I have not got\ngoat-feathers by the dozen or by the pound--I have them by the\nbale. I estimate that if all my goat-feathers were placed end to\nend they would reach from the bread line to the poor-house.\n\nIt is just possible that by this time you may gather that I have a\ngrouch on myself. If so, you are right. To-day I am forty-nine\nyears and six months old, and as a bright and shining literary\nlight I am exactly where I was twelve years ago. I am twelve years\nolder and have that much less time in which to complete the joy of\nmaking good as one of the great American authors. Presently the\ninfirmities of age will begin to gnaw at me, the moths will ruin my\nflossy collection of goat-feathers, all those who now pat me on the\nback because they can make use of me free of charge will forget\nthat I am alive, and my executors will shake their heads and say,\n\"Ain't it too bad he left so little!\"\n\nDistraction isn't really good for a man if he wants to reach a\ngoal. No salesman ever got very far by carrying too many side\nlines. The poorest sort of monopoly for any man to undertake is a\nmonopoly of goat-feathers.\n\nNo man in the world had a better chance to make himself the Great\nAmerican Humorist than I had when I wrote \"Pigs is Pigs.\" I had a\ngood, solid foundation of fairly good humorous work under it and\nthe little story had a wonderful success. The thing for me to have\ndone then was to stick to humor, regardless of anything. I have\nwritten dainty stories, sympathetic stories, serious stories, all\nkinds of stories, but not many humorous stories. It is surprising\nhow often editors have had to announce \"A story that shows this\nfamous humorist in an entirely new vein.\"\n\nTaking literature as a business, I can say that a humorist should\nhave no \"new vein.\" Neither does a plumber succeed as a plumber by\nspending a large share of his working hours making violins. No one\never succeeds by allowing himself to be deflected from the most\nimportant business of life, which is making the most of the best\nthat is in him. Even a cow does better if she sticks close to the\nbusiness of eating grass and chewing the cud. When she starts in to\nlearn to whistle like a catbird and to flit from field to field\nlike a butterfly it is safe to say she is no longer a success in\nlife. When a cow strays from plain milk-producing methods and\nbegins climbing trees and turning somersaults, she may be more\npicturesque, but she is gathering nothing but goat-feathers. Seven\nfarmers, a school-teacher and a tin peddler may line up along the\nfence and applaud her all afternoon until she is swelled with\npride, but when she gets back to the barn at sundown she will not\ngive much milk. She will not be known as a milch cow long; she will\nbe a low grade of corned beef, a couple of flank steaks and a few\npairs of three-dollar shoes.\n\nI can sit down to write a story about a man who fell off a bridge\nand landed in a kettle of tar on a canal boat and, before I have\ncompleted a full paragraph, I can have stopped to clean the small\no, small e, and small a of my typewriter with a toothpick, stopped\nto think about the pearl buttons on a vest I owned in 1894, the\nSpanish-American War, what the French word for \"illumination\" is,\nand whether I paid my last Liberty Loan installment. Before I have\nfinished that first paragraph I may have stopped to fill my\nfountain pen, gone downtown to attend a meeting of the Red Cross\nCommittee, started to recatalogue my published stories, and taken a\ntrip to Chicago. Before I have got to the first period in the first\nsentence I may have decided that I would not have a man fall off\nthe bridge but have a woman fall off it, that I would not have her\nfall off a bridge but off the Woolworth Building, that I would not\nhave her fall into a kettle of tar but into a wagonload of feather\nbeds, that I would not have her fall at all, that I would not write\na humorous story at all, that I would not write at all, and that I\nwould, instead, get an empty cigar box and make a toy circus wagon\nfor my young son.\n\nI once made an entire doll's house, two stories, four rooms,\nkitchen and bath, with hand-carved stairways and electric lighting\nthroughout, the walls entirely weatherboarded, put in the carpets,\npapered the walls, hung lace curtains at the windows and painted\nthe exterior, and all between two paragraphs of a story. I spent\nthree months on that little trip after goat-feathers, and in the\nmeantime Arnold Bennett probably wrote three novels of several\nhundred thousand words each, gained an international reputation,\nand passed me on the road to fame like an airplane passing a snail.\nGeorge Ade kept pegging away at his \"Fables\" with the regularity of\na day laborer, and Peter Finley Dunne ground out his \"Mister\nDooley\" like an unwearied sausage-grinder.\n\nOn my wall, alongside my desk, I have a calendar, and the sheet\nthat faces me is that for the first week in March, 1916. It says\n\"Concentration. Concentrate all your thoughts upon the work in\nhand. The sun's rays do not burn until brought to a focus.\nAlexander G. Bell.\" That is the whole matter in a nutshell, but the\nonly use the motto has been to me has been to permit me to look at\nit and think about it when I ought to be thinking of the story I\nwas trying to write.\n\nSo far as I am concerned, the most important person in the world is\nmyself. The most important success in the world is my success. The\nmost important money in the world is my money. A whole lot of the\nmost important debts in the world are my debts. The same is true of\nyou and your success and your money and your debts.\n\nI hope you are not near fifty years old. I hope you are nearer\ntwenty, but whatever your age I can tell you that chasing after\ngoat-feathers is mighty poor business. The time to investigate\ninteresting by-paths is when you are on a vacation, but the New\nYork-Chicago Express gets there by staying on the track. The minute\nit starts climbing some interesting country lane after daisies and\nbuttercups the coroners begin to gather and the claim agents flock\ntogether, and some slow but sure old freight train, plugging along\non the next track but sticking to it, toots a couple of times and\npasses by.\n\nIf I am ever the boss of a school board I shall insist that no child\ngraduate until he can foot correctly a pile of numbers four deep and\nforty high, and do it the first time. I have been a bookkeeper in my\nday, and I have footed a column of figures twenty times and got ten\ndifferent results. I can go up a column of figures, starting like a\nrace horse--\"Seven and six are thirteen, and five are eighteen, and\ntwo are twenty, and--and I wonder if I put a stamp on the letter I\nmailed this morning--I wonder if Bacon wrote Shakespeare's plays--I\nwonder if a bomb from an airplane would go through from the roof of\nmy house to the cellar--cellar--cellar--well, I'm glad I've got eight\ntons of coal in, but I'll have to get more in as soon as I can--and\nsix----\" Then I have to begin at the beginning again with \"Seven and\nsix are thirteen, and five are eighteen----\"\n\nThe reason children don't get their examples right in school is\nbecause they don't concentrate on the matter in hand, and the\nreason men don't get their lives right is because they don't\nconcentrate on the matter of making good at what they know is the\nbusiness of their lives--success. If you stop a moment and think of\nthe men you know who are not successes, but who might be successes,\nyou will find they are goat-feather gatherers. Anything that leads\na man aside from the straight path to his goal is a goat-feather.\nEvery useless side line is a goat-feather. Every unnecessary\ndistraction is a goat-feather. Nine tenths of the things I do are\ngoat-feathers.\n\nI don't mind telling you that I consider myself a very, very\nwonderful man. Nobody but a most remarkable man could spend so much\ntime in the goat-feather groves gathering goat-feathers and still\nkeep his family from starvation. I actually gasp when I think what\na great man I should have been if I had stuck to business instead\nof being drawn aside by every sweet odor and pleasant sound. Then I\nactually swear when I think how many hours and days and weeks I\nhave given to making myself look like a cross between a llama and a\nstuffed owl, when I might have been writing things the editors\nnever have enough of, and buy as soon as they read the first\nparagraph.\n\nIt is all right! I'm not jealous! I'll sit in the front row every\ntime Ade or Tarkington or Chambers pulls a success, and I'll\napplaud as whole-heartedly as any one, but I reserve the right to\nkick myself when I get outside. This article is one of the kicks,\nand I hope it will have a good effect on me. I hope it will teach\nme a lesson. I doubt it; I'm too old; I'm too accustomed to chasing\ngoat-feathers to give it up now.\n\nSo there you have the story of what is the matter with me. You know\nnow why, when you think of me, you think of a story I wrote twelve\nyears ago. I had a main goal, but I liked too well to investigate\nall the cross-roads instead of keeping straight on. That's bad;\nthat's gathering goat-feathers. It has been bad for me, and bad for\nmy success as an author, and bad for my success in the only life I\nhave to live, but it is apt to be much worse for you to gather\ngoat-feathers than for me to gather them, because I can,\noccasionally, weave some of them into a story, while you can't do\nanything at all with those you acquire.\n\nThe time we waste in excursions off the main line of our road to\nour goal is the difference between success and half-success; often\nit is the difference between success and failure.\n\n\n\n\n",
