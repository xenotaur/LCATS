    "body": "\"Gun, boy!\" Mulveen cried.\n\nThe big saurian--a thirty-tonner, at least--came splashing and\nbellowing out of the swamp. Gilbert quickly brought up the archaic\nEarth rifle, ramming a shell into the breech with the bolt-action\nloader. With almost the same motion he thrust the big, capable weapon\ninto Mulveen's waiting hands and the hunter brought it to his shoulder\nwithout a moment to spare.\n\nActually, it was an adapted old big-game rifle: the shells it fired\nwere atomic. Standing his ground weaponless, Gilbert saw Mulveen's\nfinger whiten on the trigger, saw the scale-hided saurian grow\nimmensely before them, heard its surprisingly high piping challenge,\nthen saw and heard in one quick flash of suspended time the roar and\nsmoke of the big rifle and the sudden life-ending, sleek-scaled,\ncolumn-legged death-rearing of the big saurian as it came upright, the\npiping a high death scream now, the small forelimbs tearing at air, the\nhead with the very tiny hole between the eyes swaying as if drunk from\nside to side, the long, muscular, five-ton tail still thrashing in the\nswamp waters.\n\nThen the saurian came down, crashing through the brakes. There was only\na trickle of blood, but the bullet, like a Dum-Dum of three hundred\nyears before, had exploded inside the monster's head, the minute atomic\ncharge destroying everything within the thick bone walls of the skull\nbut leaving skull and metal-tough skin intact.\n\nTime flowed again. Mulveen returned the rifle to Gilbert and waded\nforward through the brackish water, his hipboots glistening.\n\n\"Beauty, isn't it?\" Gilbert said with feigned professional enthusiasm\nMulveen needed the enthusiasm: the big humanoid from the Sirian system\nhad been a grumpy, fussy, dissatisfied hunter throughout the safari.\n\n\"Don't try and dun me for a tip,\" Mulveen snapped. \"You get paid\nwhatever the Earth company pays you.\" He was a big, bald man with a\nflorid face, an amazing girth of shoulders, a barrel chest and almost\npipe-stem legs which seemed barely able to support his weight.\n\nHe reached the saurian's five-foot-long head and walked around it,\nmuttering to himself. It was a prize specimen: a faudi reptile from\nEpsilon Aurigae III, bred here on Earth in the huge, planet-wide\ngame-farm. It was the sort of specimen a big-game hunter would give his\nproverbial eyeteeth to own, but Mulveen did not look happy. He merely\nsaid:\n\n\"So this is a faudi.\"\n\n\"Want me to prepare the skull, sir?\" Gilbert asked. Gilbert was\neighteen, one of the youngest guides in the game area known as\nLewsanna. His father had been a guide for the hunters from the\noutworlds, and his father's father. His father had died tracking: it\nwas a good, clean death and Gilbert's father had never known poverty.\nThat was the most an Earthman could expect, Gilbert thought without\nbitterness. For civilization had left Earth behind. Earth was in the\nbackwaters of galactic trade. Earth was a game-preserve, with the\ngreat beasts of five dozen worlds brought to it and bred here for the\nhunters. It figured, naturally: you couldn't deny it. The outworlds\nwere new; they were built as twenty-fourth century worlds should be\nbuilt. Earth had been a world of ancient cities and meaningless ancient\ntraditions. Earth was the logical place for the game-farm. Earth, once\nthe parent of all the galactic planets, reduced to a vacation spot for\nthe very rich and the foolhardy....\n\n\"No,\" Mulveen said shortly. \"Don't prepare the skull. I don't want the\nskull.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Forget it, kid! I've hunted everywhere, wherever there's hunting\nleft on the outworlds. When I grew jaded, they said come to Earth.\nEarth will be different, a hunter's paradise. You know what? It isn't\ndifferent. It's the same.\"\n\n\"If you--\"\n\n\"You wouldn't understand kid. Well, let's go back to camp.\"\n\n\"The trophy--\" Gilbert began.\n\n\"Forget about the trophy, damnit!\"\n\nGilbert followed Mulveen in silence to camp. The beaters and camp-boys\nhad the evening meal prepared. The sun went down over the swamplands.\nGilbert ate alone. He was a cut above the beaters and camp-boys, who\nhad willingly surrendered their civilized birthright, but he was\nseveral cuts above the hunter from the Sirian System.\n\n\n\nMulveen drank heavily after dinner. Gilbert watched, not caring.\nOf course, that might make it dangerous when they hunted tomorrow:\nMulveen's reflexes might be slower. Well, it had happened before.\n\n\"Boy!\" Mulveen shouted, his voice thick with alcohol.\n\nGilbert trotted up obediently. \"Sir?\"\n\nMulveen smiled at him. \"How would you like to earn five thousand\ncredits?\"\n\nThe answer was obvious: Gilbert made fifty credits a safari and\nsometimes went on as many as eight a year. Tips might bring the figure\nto an even five hundred credits a year. The figure Mulveen had named\nwas ten year's work.\n\n\"I'm listening,\" Gilbert said.\n\nMulveen paced back and forth. Something had gotten to him. Hunters were\nlike that, Gilbert knew. They were capable of being possessed by an\nidea--to the exclusion of all else. Gilbert had known hunters who, so\npossessed, had crossed a dozen light years.\n\n\"This planet,\" Mulveen said, \"is real jerkwater, isn't it?\"\n\n\"If you mean what I think, yes.\"\n\n\"What kind of law do you have?\"\n\n\"Only what we need. It doesn't apply to extra-terrestrials.\"\n\n\"I thought so. Then an extra-terrestrial can commit any crime, any\ncrime at all?\"\n\nGilbert smiled grimly. \"The Earth government--such as it is--considers\nextra-terrestrials too civilized to commit crimes. Also,\nextra-terrestrial hunters are responsible for most of Earth's income.\nThis is a poor planet, Mr. Mulveen: civilization and then the attempt\nto keep up with civilization, has drained it.\"\n\n\"You know a lot for a kid.\"\n\n\"But that isn't what I'm getting five thousand credits for.\"\n\n\"Here,\" Mulveen said. He gave Gilbert one of the rifles, which had been\ncleaned during supper by the boys. He gave Gilbert a cartridge belt.\n\"Here.\"\n\n\"I don't get it,\" Gilbert said.\n\n\"If no game on Earth holds a thrill for me, no game anywhere in the\ngalaxy will. The five thousand is yours if you do.\"\n\nMulveen took another drink, poured again, drank again, poured....\n\n\"If I do what?\"\n\n\"Get out of camp,\" Mulveen said. \"I'll come for you in the morning.\"\n\n\"Come for me...?\"\n\n\"Come hunting, Gilbert. I've never hunted a human being before. On\nEarth I think I can get away with it. Well, can't I?\"\n\nGilbert felt his pulses hammering. It was a drunken impulse, but\nMulveen would go through with it. Gilbert was, despite his age, an\nexpert guide. Mulveen was a crack hunter. Five thousand credits....\n\n\"To the death?\" Gilbert asked.\n\n\"I wouldn't be playing games. Hell, yes.\"\n\n\"What if I get killed?\"\n\n\"I'll put it in writing. The credits go to whatever person you name, in\nthe event of your death.\"\n\nGilbert thought, _if I'm dead I won't need the credits, but if I live,\nif I win, those credits can buy me a new way of life...._\n\nFive thousand credits....\n\n\"Can I fight back?\" Gilbert heard himself asking.\n\n\"Does an animal? Of course you can. I'll also put in writing that\nyou're not responsible in the event of my death. What do you say, boy?\nWhat do you say?\"\n\nThe swamp smell was thick on the still, heavy air of night. Insects\nbuzzed and sawed off in the darkness. Mulveen was breathing heavily,\nimpatiently, consumed by the fires of his idea. \"Well?\"\n\nGilbert broke the silence by holding the rifle up to the firelight and\nbolting open the chamber. A fresh clip of ammo was in place.\n\n\"Didn't trust me?\" Mulveen asked.\n\n\"Should I have?\"\n\n\"Up to this minute, sure. But if your answer is yes, stop trusting me\nabout anything. Because then you're on your own.\"\n\n\"For how long?\" Gilbert asked. \"A day?\"\n\n\"Day, hell. Till I get you--or you get me.\"\n\n\"And you'll have the beaters, the boys?\"\n\n\"I paid for them, didn't I?\"\n\nGilbert nodded. The night beckoned. He took his rifle and left camp.\nMulveen wrote the agreement.\n\n\n\nHe had not gone very far until he realized he was being followed.\nAlready? he thought. He slipped silently off the trail and waited in\nthe hot, sweat-producing darkness. Footsteps came along the trail.\nGilbert saw a shadowy figure. Too small for Mulveen.\n\nGilbert waited until the figure was abreast of him, then leaped.\n\nThey went down together in the mud. Gilbert's strong young muscles soon\nbested his opponent. He sat astride the unseen enemy's middle, his\nfists raised. \"Surrender,\" he said.\n\n\"I surrender.\" Gilbert recognized Wenzi's voice. Wenzi was one of the\nbeaters, an aloofly quiet boy who had kept to himself all during the\nsafari, and who, Gilbert remembered, wore far too much clothing for the\nwarm, sticky weather.\n\nGilbert got up, holding Wenzi's elbow. Wenzi said, \"I heard what the\nmaster and you said. I came.\"\n\n\"But why?\" Gilbert demanded. \"Don't tell me you think I'll beat\nMulveen?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Wenzi glumly. \"Mulveen will win. But I was afraid.\"\n\n\"Of what?\"\n\n\"Before the hunt this morning,\" Wenzi said, \"I went down to the stream\nto wash. I went alone.\"\n\n\"You always go alone,\" Gilbert said. \"Sweating in your trousers and\nshirt no matter how hot it is.\"\n\n\"I have to,\" said Wenzi.\n\n\"Have to?\"\n\n\"Mulveen must have been suspicious. He followed me this morning. He\nsaw. Tonight, he said. Tonight, Wenzi. I had to come after you,\nGilbert.\"\n\n\"Tonight? Tonight what?\"\n\n\"Mulveen saw me at the stream. This is a good way to make a living,\nGilbert. Better than the other ways which are open to me. It is clean.\nIt is decent, if degrading. I am a girl, Gilbert.\"\n\nThe news stunned him. A girl on safari--it was unthinkable. A girl,\nhere....\n\n\"But don't you have a family? A father or brother to provide for you?\"\n\n\"No one. And I'm seventeen.\"\n\nSeventeen. Wenzi, by modern Earth standards gone primitive, was a woman.\n\nSuddenly Gilbert tensed. He had heard something, a slight stirring in\nthe dark swamp. Had Wenzi been followed? Had this whole thing been\nelaborately planned by Mulveen, planned already in the morning, giving\nWenzi a reason to flee so that Wenzi would flee to Gilbert at night and\nGilbert would be caught and killed, legitimate quarry now, even before\nmorning came?\n\nGilbert touched Wenzi's lips with his fingers, hoping she would\nunderstand. He took her arm and led her silently from the swamp-trail.\n\nThey waited in among the wet creepers and tree-roots. Gilbert could\nfeel Wenzi's frightened breathing as she leaned close to him. Whatever\nwas pursuing them came on through the swamp. Once it floundered off the\ntrail in darkness, splashing. It came on again. It paused, making a\nsniffing sound. An animal? A swamp-hog, perhaps? It sounded about the\nright size and bulk--but so would a man....\n\nGilbert brought the rifle up. A dark shadow stirred. \"Stop!\" Gilbert\ncommanded. \"You're in my sights. I can kill you.\"\n\n\"Gil!\" a voice implored.\n\nGilbert dropped the rifle and let it swing on the shoulder thong.\n\n\"Arnaud,\" he said. \"I could have shot you.\" Arnaud was the safari's\nchief beater and second in command to Gilbert.\n\n\"Mulveen told me what he was doing,\" Arnaud said. \"I slipped out of\ncamp.\"\n\n\"Why? You think Mulveen's going to lose?\"\n\n\"With a dozen boys? No, I couldn't help him hunt you and kill you,\nthat's all.\"\n\nArnaud touched his hand. They shook hands solemnly. It was an old\ngesture which Earthmen had never lost. Gilbert told Arnaud Wenzi was\nthere, told Arnaud Wenzi was a girl.\n\n\"So there are three of us now,\" Arnaud said.\n\nGilbert nodded, then realized the gesture was lost in darkness. He\nsaid, aloud, \"We'd better put some distance between us and the camp.\"\n\nThey returned to the trail, plodded through the hot darkness. They\nwalked for three hours and reached high ground as Gilbert had expected.\n\"We can sleep here,\" he said. \"But we'll have to be up before the sun.\nAnd we'll have to hunt for our food, too. Mulveen has provisions.\"\n\n\"Do you hate Mulveen?\" Wenzi asked.\n\n\"For his proposition? No, why should I?\"\n\n\"For his arrogance--\"\n\n\"He is an outworlder,\" Arnaud said.\n\n\"For what he wanted of you,\" Gilbert told Wenzi, \"yes. But only for\nthat.\"\n\n\"Do you have any plans?\" Arnaud asked as they settled on the hillock.\n\nGilbert thought about it. They would need a plan, all right. It was\nwhat the animals of Earth lacked. The ability to plan, to rationally\npursue their survival. And so the animals of Earth never had a chance.\n\n\"Mulveen will probably stalk us in the morning,\" Gilbert said. \"We'll\nhave to move fast. We'll be able to move faster than Mulveen because\nhe'll be tracking us. We can circle around behind him--while he still\nbelieves himself behind us.\"\n\n\"It might work,\" Wenzi said, but not too optimistically.\n\n\"I don't see how it can miss!\" Arnaud declared jubilantly. \"Now let's\nget some sleep.\"\n\nGilbert was tired all at once. He felt the fatigue crawl through his\nmuscles, dull his senses. He'd been on the go all day, and walking half\nthe night. He drifted quickly into sleep and dreamed of a faudi reptile\nwith the face of the hunter Mulveen, chasing them with tail-supported\nforty yard leaps....\n\n\n\nHe awoke in dim light. Like any experienced hunter, he awoke knowing\nexactly where he was and what was happening. The first thing he did was\nreach for his rifle. He had placed it at his side.\n\nIt was gone.\n\n\"Wenzi?\" he called. No answer.\n\n\"Arnaud?\" Silence.\n\n\"Wenzi! Arnaud!\" he shouted. He stood up quickly. He had the hillock of\nhigh, dry ground all to himself.\n\nDistantly, he heard a scream. Wenzi's voice? he thought it was.\n\n\"Wenzi!\" he shouted again, at the top of his voice.\n\nThe scream was faint. She might have been calling his name. It might\nhave been pure terror.\n\nArnaud, he thought. Arnaud has taken Wenzi. But why? Why? He was only a\ntracker, a beater. He couldn't provide for her. He wouldn't dare ravish\nher, for while there was no penalty for an outworlder, the penalty for\nan Earthman was severe.\n\nMulveen, he thought.\n\nMulveen's idea. Arnaud had never left Mulveen. Arnaud had come\nfollowing Gilbert--as Mulveen's man. Mulveen knew Wenzi was gone.\nMulveen reasoned she had gone to Gilbert, further reasoned that Gilbert\nwould protect her. Mulveen had sent Arnaud for her. And for Gilbert's\nrifle.\n\nGilbert was weaponless.\n\nFive thousand credits, he thought. And my life.\n\nWenzi--in Mulveen's possession. Or, in his possession when the traitor\nArnaud brought her back to camp.\n\nI can forget about her. I don't know her. Until last night I thought\nshe was a boy, he told himself. I can flee and find a weapon somewhere.\n\nEven while he told himself this, he was walking back along the trail.\nWenzi had trusted him. Wenzi had fled to him at once. She had faith\nin him. A blind, almost childish faith, even if she hadn't put it in\nwords. She had come, and that was enough.\n\nFor the first time in his life, Gilbert felt anger. And a burning,\nconsuming hate.\n\nHe loped with ground-consuming strides along the trail.\n\n\n\nAn hour later, he heard the beaters. They were coming. They were coming\nfor him.\n\nThey could have waited. But Mulveen was trying everything. Throw the\nworks if you could, that's what the guides always said. Mulveen had\nWenzi. It was a kind of bait and Gilbert might or might not rise to it.\nSo the beaters were coming through the swamp.\n\nBeaters. Yesterday, his men. Now, he was their quarry.\n\nHe crouched. In a moment he became part of the jungle, a shadow barely\nseen in the dim swamp, insubstantial, soundless. The beaters came on.\nIf he were hunting a man-sized and weaponless animal, Gilbert thought,\nhe would send the beaters through with staves and machetes....\n\nHe watched them come. He could name them, they came so close. They\nbeat the undergrowth and the hanging creepers, vines and lianas with\ntheir clubs. Here and there he caught the gleam of a machete blade.\nIf they spotted him they would make a rush, cutting off his retreat,\nsurrounding him on three sides and forcing him back along the trail\ntoward where Mulveen was waiting, probably in a comfortable blind, with\nan atomic rifle.\n\nUnless, right now, Mulveen was too busy with Wenzi....\n\nNo, he told himself. It wouldn't be that way. Mulveen would want his\ntriumph first. Wenzi would wait, a prisoner, for nightfall. But could\nhe be sure?\n\nThe beaters went by, advancing through the swamp. One came so close,\nGilbert could have reached out and touched him.\n\nGilbert stood up, stretching his stiff muscles. He waited an agonizing\nfive more minutes, then set out along the trail.\n\nA laggard beater materialized abruptly in his path. The machete blurred\noverhead, blade gleaming. The man's face showed recognition, but\nneither pity nor regret. He wouldn't kill Gilbert, naturally. He wanted\nGilbert to run--back toward Mulveen.\n\nGilbert ducked under the upswinging arm. He drove his shoulder into\nthe beater's midsection and felt the hard wall of muscle hold for a\nsplit-second, then yield. The beater jackknifed over. Gilbert let\nhimself drop, grasped the beater's ankles and heaved. The beater\nsailed, yelling, over his head. The beater landed face-first in the\nswamp and Gilbert dove after him. He found the machete-haft, twisted.\nThe big-bladed weapon came free in his hand, but the beater lifted his\nhead from the mud and cried:\n\n\"Mulveen! Mulveen, sir! Mulveen!\"\n\nGilbert struck with the side of the machete blade, using it as a club.\nThe beater subsided face-down in the mud. Gilbert looked down at him,\nthen scowled and turned him face-up in the swamp so he wouldn't drown.\n\nJust then Mulveen's rifle cracked. The swamp-water swallowed the flat\nsound: there was no echo.\n\nMulveen heard the cry--he was close. Perhaps close enough to see the\nwhite sheen of frothing water where the beater had fallen....\n\nQuickly Gilbert slipped with his machete among the mangrove roots. He\nmade his way through the thick tangle of gnarled roots and the slime of\nthe swamp back in the direction from which the beater had come. Behind\nhim he heard the clubs and machetes of the other beaters, returning now\ntoward the rifle fire.\n\nUp ahead somewhere unseen in the swamp Mulveen was waiting with his\natomic rifle. Behind Gilbert, the beaters were coming.\n\nWenzi screamed, close by. With Mulveen? Gilbert crashed through the\nmangroves in that direction. Mulveen would hear him--but wouldn't see\nhim. The mangroves were a thick tangle of twisted trunks and roots.\nMulveen would have no chance for a clear shot until almost the last\nmoment.\n\nSuddenly, Gilbert stopped dead in his tracks. Wenzi--was she part\nof it? She could have fled to him, pretending. She could have been\nin league with Arnaud and Mulveen. There was no reason to believe\notherwise. The trackers and beaters knew no loyalties. They were hardly\nmore than animals. But somehow, Wenzi seemed different. As Gilbert\nthought himself different.\n\nThe thoughts raced through his mind. There were the continents of\nEarth, but the continents were game-reserves. The men were hardly more\nthan game themselves. But there were the offshore islands, which had\nnot been stocked with animals. It was rumored that another brand of men\nlived there, men who had fled from the continents, men determined to\npreserve their heritage and one day when they were strong enough return\nwith it to the mainlands....\n\nWith his five thousand credits, Gilbert could buy a boat, sail to the\nislands....\n\nWenzi screamed again.\n\nMulveen's rifle roared. He was closer now. Wood splintered from the\nmangrove roots, peppering Gilbert. Heedless, he plunged on, impelled\nby the shouts of the beaters behind him. Grimly he thought: I'm giving\nMulveen his money's worth. But that wasn't quite true. Mulveen would\nnot really get his money's worth until Gilbert was dead.\n\n\n\nThe rifle roared again and Gilbert thought he saw the muzzle-flash up\nahead in the dark swamp. He ran splashing through the water and felt\nthe spray as the rifle spoke once more. The minute atomic explosion\nwent off in the water not ten yards from Gilbert. The concussion\nstaggered him and he fell forward on his face, his head striking a\nmangrove root jarringly.\n\nHis senses swam. He heard a splashing, floundering sound. Mulveen.\nMulveen was coming for him. He ducked behind a mangrove, waiting.\nMiraculously he still held the machete. He felt blood on his shoulder\nand chest, realized that he had probably fallen sideways across the\nblade.\n\nWenzi and Mulveen came through the swamp. Wenzi was in front. They were\nso close that Gilbert could see how the girl's hands were secured\nbehind her back, how Mulveen held a trailing rope, how the trailing\nrope was wrapped around Mulveen's thick waist so he could drop it when\nhe had to and lift his rifle in both hands....\n\nGilbert came charging at them with his machete. With one swift stroke\nhe parted the rope and shouted: \"Run, Wenzi! Run!\"\n\nThe rifle-muzzle came up. Gilbert dove face-down as the weapon roared.\nHe felt the fierce blast of it, then was clawing through the mud at\nMulveen's legs. Mulveen brought the rifle-butt crashing down. It jarred\nagainst Gilbert's shoulder, pushing him down into the water. He felt\nthe machete drop from his fingers and from what seemed a long way off\nhe heard Wenzi's scream although he was aware that the girl had not\nmoved, was standing there awaiting the outcome.\n\nThe rifle pointed down at him. He reached up, tugging at the muzzle,\npulling himself upright. Mulveen stumbled, cursing. Gilbert pulled the\nrifle-barrel into the mud and Mulveen came down with it on top of him.\nThe beaters had reached them now, but the beaters were indifferent.\nMulveen was the hunter: Mulveen had given his orders. But Gilbert was\ntheir chief guide and now it was a question of who was hunter and who\nhunted. Their loyalty would belong to the victor....\n\nMulveen's great weight came down on top of him. Mulveen had discarded\nthe water-filled rifle. His hands closed on Gilbert's throat. His\nweight held Gilbert pinned.... In seconds--certainly no more than\nminutes--Gilbert would lose consciousness, the last air used up and\nself-poisoned and burning in his lungs, Mulveen's triumphant shouts\nringing in his ears.\n\nBut it wasn't merely for himself.\n\nAnd it wasn't merely for Wenzi.\n\nIt was for Gilbert of Lewsanna--Earthman. And for a dream of the\nislands, and of Earthmen claiming their heritage again, if not in\nGilbert's generation then in the one which followed....\n\nHe scooped a handful of mud and brought his hand, ooze and all, against\nMulveen's face. He found the eyes and clawed at them. He heard Mulveen\nbellowing for the beaters. But the beaters were impartial.\n\nHis thumbs were pressing on Mulveen's eyes now, but Mulveen's strong\nfingers were still on his throat. He felt something give. Mulveen went\non bellowing, but also slowly choking the life out of him.\n\nHe shifted his hands to Mulveen's mouth. He pulled at the lips. He\nyanked with all his remaining strength and there was suddenly a pure\nanimal scream of pain and a quick flow of hot blood across his hand and\na release of the terrible pressure around his throat.\n\nHe got up. Mulveen's face was torn. Mulveen lifted his hand weakly.\nThere was a knife in it. Gilbert slapped out at the hand and the knife\ndropped. Gilbert caught it, held the point at Mulveen's throat.\n\n\"I could kill you,\" Gilbert said.\n\nMulveen whined: \"Don't! Please, you've earned the money. The money is\nyours!\"\n\nHe could kill Mulveen, yes--but would one of the Earthmen of the\nislands, the real Earthmen, have done that? They would have been\ncontent with victory--and with shaming the outworlder Mulveen in front\nof the beaters and trackers.\n\n\"Don't come back to Earth,\" Gilbert said. \"Ever. We don't want you\nhere. Put that in writing too.\"\n\n\"I will. I will, I swear!\" Mulveen was cowering.\n\nArnaud came to them, smiling. \"Great work, Gil--\" he began. Gilbert hit\nhim and the tracker went sprawling in the mud. He came up snarling but\nlooked at Gilbert and muttered a curse and did nothing.\n\nLater, a completely beaten Mulveen, his face swathed in bandages,\ncounted out the credits. \"Make it ten thousand,\" Gilbert told him.\n\"Five thousand for Wenzi.\"\n\nMulveen counted out ten thousand credits. \"But you'll have to lead us\nback to civilization,\" he said.\n\nGilbert looked at Arnaud. \"He will,\" Gilbert told Mulveen. \"I'm not a\nguide now. I'm a man. An Earthman.\"\n\nMulveen looked at him. Mulveen did not smile. Something in Mulveen's\nface, in his eyes, spoke clearly of the day when Earthmen would regain\ntheir heritage. Mulveen was afraid.\n\nGilbert took Wenzi's hand and walked off into the swamp. They would buy\na boat. And after that....\n",
