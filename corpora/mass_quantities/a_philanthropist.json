She spoke with irritation because of the amused smile\nof the lodger. He bowed with the grace that characterized all his lazy\nmovements.\n\n\u201cHe looked very much like that Tom Waters that I had at the Reformed\nDrunkards' League last year. I even thought he was Tom--\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know Tom?\u201d hazarded the lodger.\n\n\u201cNo. I don't know whether I ever mentioned him to you. He came twice to\nthe League, and we were really quite hopeful about him, and the third\ntime he asked to have the meeting at his house. We thought it a great\nsign--the best of signs, in fact. So as a great favor we went there\ninstead of meeting at the Rooms. I was a little late--I lost the\nway--and when I got there I heard a great noise as if they were singing\ndifferent songs at the same time. I hurried in to lead them--they get\nso mixed in the singing--and--it makes me blush now to think of it!--the\nwretch had invited them all early, and--and they were all intoxicated!\n\n\u201cI am sorry I told you,\u201d she added with dignity; for the lodger, in an\nendeavor to smile sympathetically, had lost his way and was convulsed\nwith a mirth entirely unregretful.\n\n\u201cNot at all, not at all,\u201d he murmured politely. \u201cIt is a delightful\nstory. I would not have missed it--a choir of reformed drunkards! But do\nyou not, my dear Miss Gould, perceive in these little setbacks a warning\nagainst further attempts? Do you still attend the League? It is not\npossible!\u201d\n\n\u201cPossible?\u201d echoed his visitor; for owing to certain recent and untoward\ncircumstances, Miss Gould was half reclining in her lodger's great\nIndian chair, sipping a glass of his '49 port. \u201cIndeed I do! They\nhad every one of them to be reformed all over again! It was most\ndisgraceful!\u201d\n\nHer lodger checked a rising smile, and leaned solicitously toward her,\nregarding her firm, fine-featured face with flattering attention.\n\n\u201cAre you growing stronger? Can I bring you anything?\u201d he inquired.\n\nMiss Gould's color rose, half with anger at her weakness of body, half\nwith a vexed consciousness of his amusement.\n\n\u201cThank you, no,\u201d she returned coldly, \u201cI am ashamed to have been so\nweak-minded. I must go now and tell Henry to pile the wood again in the\neast corner. There will probably come another tramp very soon--they are\nvery prevalent this month, I hear.\u201d\n\nHer lodger left his low wicker seat--a proof of enormous excitement--and\nfrowned at her.\n\n\u201cDo you seriously mean, Miss Gould, that you are going to run the risk\nof another such--such catastrophe? It is absurd. I cannot believe it of\nyou! Is there no other way--\u201d\n\nBut he had been standing a long while, it occurred to him, and he\nretired to the chair again. A splinter of wood on his immaculate white\nflannel coat caught his eye, and a slow smile spread over his handsome,\nlazy face. It grew and grew until at last a distinct chuckle penetrated\nto the dusky corner where the Indian chair leaned back against dull\nOriental draperies. Its occupant attempted to rise, her face stern, her\nmouth unrelenting. He was at her side instantly.\n\n\u201cTake my arm--and pardon me!\u201d he said with an irresistible grace. \u201cIt is\nonly my fear for your comfort, you know, Miss Gould. I cannot bear that\nyou should be at the mercy of every drunken fellow that wishes to impose\non you!\u201d\n\nAs she crossed the hall that separated her territory from his, her fine,\nfull figure erect, her dark head high in the air, a whimsical regret\ncame over him that they were not younger and more foolish.\n\n\u201cI should certainly marry her to reform her,\u201d he said to the birch log\nthat spluttered on his inimitable colonial fire-dogs. And then, as the\nremembrance of the events of the morning came to him, he laughed again.\n\nHe had been disturbed at his leisurely coffee and roll by a rapid\nand ceaseless pounding, followed by a violent rattling, and varied by\nstifled cries apparently from the woodshed. The din seemed to come from\nthe lower part of the house, and after one or two futile appeals to the\nman who served as valet, cook, and butler in his bachelor establishment,\nhe decided that he was alone in his half of the house, and that the\nnoise came from Miss Gould's side. He strolled down the beautiful\nwinding staircase, and dragged his crimson dressing-gown to the top\nof the cellar stairs, the uproar growing momentarily more terrific.\nHalf-way down the whitewashed steps he paused, viewing the remarkable\nscene below him with interest and amazement. The cemented floor was\nliterally covered with neatly chopped kindling-wood, which rose as in a\ntide under the efforts of a large red-faced man who, with the regularity\nof a machine, stooped, grasped a billet in either hand, shook them in\nthe face of Miss Gould, who cowered upon a soap-box at his side, and\nflung them on the floor. From the woodhouse near the cellar muffled\nshouts were heard through a storm of blows on the door. From the\nrattling of this door, and the fact that the red-faced man aimed every\nthird stick at it, the observer might readily conclude that some one\ndesirous of leaving the woodhouse was locked within it.\n\nFor a moment the spectator on the stairs stood stunned. The noise\nwas deafening; the appearance of the man, whose expression was one of\nsettled rage but whose actions were of the coldest regularity, was most\nbewildering, partially obscured as it was by the flying billets of\nwood; the mechanical attempts of Miss Gould to rise from the soap-box,\ninvariably checked by a fierce brandishing of the stick just taken from\nthe lessening pile, were at once startling and fascinating, inasmuch\nas she was methodically waved back just as her knees had unbent for the\ntrial, and as methodically essayed her escape again, alternately rising\nwith dignity and sinking back in terror.\n\nThe red dressing-gown advanced a step, and met her gaze. Dignity and\nterror shifted to relief.\n\n\u201cOh, Mr. Welles!\u201d she gasped. Her lodger girded up his _robe de chambre_\nwith its red silk cord and advanced with decision through the chaos of\nbirch and hickory. A struggle, sharp but brief, and he turned to find\nMiss Gould offering a coil of clothes-rope with which to bind the\nconquered, whom conflict had sobered, for he made no resistance.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean by such idiotic actions?\u201d the squire of dames\ndemanded, as he freed the maddened Henry from his durance vile in the\nwoodhouse and confronted the red-faced man, who had not uttered a word.\n\nHe cast a baffled glance at Miss Gould and a triumphant smile at Henry\nbefore replying. Then, disdaining the lady's righteous indignation and\nthe hired man's threatening gestures, he faced the gentleman in the\nscarlet robe and spoke as man to man.\n\n\u201cGov'nor,\u201d he said with somewhat thickened speech, \u201cI come here an' I\nasked for a meal. An' she tol' me would I work fer it? An' I said yes.\nAn' she come into this ol' vault of a suller, an' she pointed to that\nol' heap o' wood, an' she tol' me ter move it over ter that corner.\nAn' I done so fer half an hour. An' I says to that blitherin' fool over\nthere, who was workin' in that ol' wood-house, what the devil did she\ncare w'ich corner the darned stuff was in? An' he says that she didn't\ncare a hang, but that she'd tell the next man that come along to move\nit back to where I got it from; he said 'twas a matter er principle\nwith her not to give a man a bite fer nothin'! So I shut him in his ol'\nhouse, an' w'en she come down I gave her a piece of my mind. I don't\nmind a little work, mister, but when it come to shufflin' kind-lin's\nround in this ol' tomb fer half an hour an' makin' a fool o' myself fer\nnothin', I got my back up. My time ain't so vallyble to me as 'tis to\nsome, gov'nor, but it's worth a damn sight more'n that!\u201d\n\nMiss Gould's lodger shuddered as he remembered the quarter he had\nsurreptitiously bestowed upon the man, and the withering scorn that\nwould be his portion were the weakness known. He smiled as he recalled\nthe scene in the cellar when he had helped Miss Gould up the stairs and\nreturned to soothe Henry, who regretted that he had left one timber of\nthe woodhouse upon another.\n\n\u201cThough I'm bound to say, Mr. Welles, that I see how he felt. I've often\nfelt like a fool explainin' how they was to move that wood back an'\nforth. It does seem strange that Miss Gould has to do it that way. Give\n'em some-thin' an' let 'em go, I say!\u201d\n\nIt was precisely his own view--but how fundamentally immoral the\nposition was he knew so well! He recalled Miss Gould's lectures on the\nsubject, miracles of eloquence and irrefutably correct in deductions\nthat interested him not nearly so much as the lecturer.\n\n\u201cSo firm, so positive, so wholesome!\u201d he would murmur to himself in\ntacit apology for the instructive hours spent before their common\nground, the great fireplace in the central hall. He never sat there\nwithout remembering their first interview: her resentment at an\nabsolutely inexcusable intrusion slowly melting before his exquisite\nappreciation of every line and corner of the old colonial homestead; her\nreserve waning at every touch of his irresistible courtesy, till, to her\nown open amazement, she rose to conduct this connoisseur in antiquities\nthrough the rooms whose delights he had perfectly foreseen, he assured\nher, from the modelling of the front porch; her utter and instantaneous\nrefusal to consider for a second his proposal to lodge a stranger in\nhalf of her father's house; and the na\u00efve and conscientious struggle\nwith her principles when, with a logic none the less forcible because\nit was so gracefully developed, he convinced her that her plain duty lay\nalong the lines of his choice.\n\nFor as a philanthropist what could she do? Here were placed in her hands\nmeans she could not in conscience overlook. Rapidly translating his\ndollars into converts, he juggled them before her dazzled eyes; he\neven hinted delicately at Duty, with that exact conception of the\nrequirements of the stern daughter felt by none so keenly as those who\nsystematically avoid her.\n\nHis good genius prompted him to refer casually to soup-kitchens.\nNow soup-kitchens were the delight of Miss Gould's heart; toward the\nestablishment of a soup-kitchen she had looked since the day when her\nfather's death had left her the double legacy of his worldly goods and\nhis unworldly philanthropy.\n\nVisions of dozens of Bacchic revellers, riotous no more, but seated\ntemperately each before his steaming bowl, rose to her delighted eyes;\nshe saw in fancy the daughters and nieces of the reformed in smiles and\nwhite aprons ladling the nutritious and attractive compound, earning\nthus an honest wage; she saw a neatly balanced account-book and a\ntriumphant report; she saw herself the respected and deprecatory idol of\na millennial village. She wavered, hesitated, and was lost.\n\nThat very evening saw the establishment of a second m\u00e9nage in the north\nside of the house, and though a swift regret chilled her manner for\nweeks, she found herself little by little growing interested in her\nlodger, and conscious of an increasing desire to benefit him, an\nirritated longing to influence him for good, to turn him from the\nbutterfly whims of a pretended invalid to an appreciation of the\nresponsibilities of life.\n\nFor in all her well-ordered forty years Miss Gould had never seen so\nindolent, so capricious, so irresponsible a person. That a man of easy\nmeans, fine education, sufficient health, and gray hair should have\nnothing better to do than collect willow-ware and fire-irons, read the\nmagazines, play the piano, and stroll about in the sun seemed to her\nnothing less than horrible.\n\nEach day that added some new treasure to his perfectly arranged rooms,\nand in consequence some new song to his seductive repertoire, left a new\nsting in her soul. She had been influencing somebody or something all\nher life. She had been educating and directing and benefiting till she\nwas forced to be grateful to that providential generosity that caused\nnew wickedness and ignorance to spring constantly from this very soil\nshe had cleared; for if one reform had been sufficient she would long\nsince have been obliged to leave the little village for larger fields.\nShe had ministered to the starved mind as to the stunted body; the idle\nand dissolute quaked before her. And yet here in her own household,\nacross her hall, lived the epitome of uselessness, indolence,\nselfishness, and--she was forced to admit it--charm. What corresponded\nto a sense of humor in her caught at the discrepancy and worried over\nit.\n\nWhat! was she not competent, then, to influence her equals? For in\neverything but moral stamina she was forced to admit that her lodger was\nher equal, if no more. Widely travelled, well read, well born, talented,\nhandsome, deferential--but persistently amused at her, irrevocably\nindolent, hopelessly selfish.\n\nWith the firm intention of turning the occasions to his benefit, she had\nfinally accepted his regular and courteous invitation to take tea with\nhim, and had watched his graceful management of samovar and tea-cup with\nopen disfavor. \u201cA habit picked up in England,\u201d he had assured her, when,\nwith the frankness characteristic of her, she had criticised him for the\neffeminacy. And his smiling explanation had sent a sudden flush across\nher smooth, firm cheeks. Was she provincial? Did she seem to him a New\nEngland villager and nothing more? She bit her lip, and the appeal she\nhad planned went unspoken that day.\n\nBut her desire could not rest, and as to her strict notions the\ncontinual visits from her side to his seemed unsuitable, she gave in\nself-defence her own invitation, and Wednesday and Saturday afternoons\nsaw her lodger across the hall drinking her own tea with wine and\nplum-cake by the shining kettle.\n\nIf she could command his admiration in no other way, she felt, she might\nsafely rely on his deferential respect for the owner of that pewter\ntea-service--velvety, shimmering, glistening dully, with shapes that\nvaguely recalled Greek lamps and Etruscan urns. And she piled wedges of\nambrosial plum-cake with yellow frosting on sprigged china, and set out\nwine in her great-grandfather's long-necked decanter, and, with what\nshe considered a gracious tact, overlooked the flippancy of her guest's\ndesultory conversation, and sincerely tried to discover the humorous\nquality in her conversation that forced a subdued chuckle now and then\nfrom her listener.\n\nShe confided most of her schemes to him, sometimes unconsciously, and\ngrew to depend more than she knew upon his common sense and experience;\nfor, though openly cynical of her works, he would give her what she\noften realized to be the best of practical advice, and his amusing\ngeneralities, though to her mind insults to humanity, had been so\nbitterly proved true that she looked fearfully to see his lightest\nadverse prophecy fulfilled.\n\nAfter a cautious introduction of the subject by asking his advice as\nto the minimum of hours in the week one could conscientiously allow a\ndoubtful member of the Weekly Culture Club to spend upon Browning, she\nendeavored to get his idea of that poet. Her famous theory as to\nher ability to place any one satisfactorily in the scale of culture\naccording to his degree of appreciation of \u201cRabbi ben Ezra\u201d\n was unfortunately known to her lodger before she could with any\nverisimilitude produce the book, and he was wary of committing himself.\nThe exquisite effrontery with which she finally brought out her\ngray-green volume was only equalled by the forbearing courtesy with\nwhich he welcomed both it and her. Nor did he offer any other comment on\nher opening the book at a well-worn page than an apologetic removal to\nthe only chair in the room more comfortable than the one he was at the\ntime occupying. He listened in silence to her intelligent if somewhat\nsonorous rendering of selected portions of \u201cSaul,\u201d thanking her politely\nat the close, and only stipulating that he should be allowed to return\nthe favor by a reading from one of his own favorite poets. With a\nshocked remembrance of certain yellow-covered volumes she had often\ncleared away from the piazza, Miss Gould inquired if the poet in\nquestion were English. On his hearty affirmative she resigned herself\nwith no little interest to the opportunity of seeing her way more\nclearly into this baffling mind, horrified at his criticism of the\nsecond reading--for she had brought the \u201cRabbi\u201d forward at last,\n\n     \u201cThen welcome each rebuff\n     That turns earth's smoothness rough,\n     Each sting that bids nor sit nor stand, but go!\u201d\n\nshe had intoned; and, fixing her eye sternly on the butterfly in white\nflannels, she had asked him with a telling emphasis what that meant to\nhim? With the sweetest smile in the world, he had leaned forward, sipped\nhis tea, gazed thoughtfully in the fire, and answered, with a polite\napology for the homeliness of the illustration, that it reminded him\nmost strongly of a tack fixed in the seat of a chair, with the attendant\ncircumstances! After a convulsive effort to include in one terrible\nsentence all the scorn and regret and pity that she felt, Miss Gould had\ndecided that silence was best, and sat back wondering why she suffered\nhim one instant in her parlor. He took from the floor beside him at this\npoint a neat red volume, and, murmuring something about his inability to\ndo the poet justice, he began to read. For one, two, four minutes Miss\nGould sat staring; then she interrupted him coldly:\n\n\u201cAnd who is the author of that doggerel, Mr. Welles?\u201d\n\n\u201cEdward Lear, dear Miss Gould--and a great man, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I might have been spared--\u201d she began with such genuine anger\nthat any but her lodger would have quailed. He, however, merely smiled.\n\n\u201cBut the subtlety of it--the immensity of the conception--the power of\ncharacterization!\u201d he cried. \u201cJust see how quietly this is treated.\u201d\n\nAnd to her amazement she let him go on; so that a chance visitor,\nentering unannounced, might have been treated to the delicious spectacle\nof a charming middle-aged gentleman in white flannels reading, near a\nbirch fire and a priceless pewter tea-service, to a handsome middle-aged\nwoman in black silk, the following pregnant lines:\n\n     \u201cThere was an old person of Bow,\n     Whom nobody happened to know,\n          So they gave him some soap,\n          And said coldly, 'We hope\n     You will go back directly to Bow!'\n\nAnd the illustration is worthy of the text,\u201d he added enthusiastically,\nas he passed the volume to her.\n\nShe had no sense of humor, but she had a sense of justice, and it\noccurred to her that after all an agreement was an agreement. If to\nlisten to insinuating inanities was the price of his attention, she\nwould pay it. She had borne more than this in order to do good.\n\nSo the readings continued, a source of unmixed delight to her lodger and\na great spiritual discipline to herself.\n\nAs the days grew milder their intimacy, profiting by the winter\nseclusion, led him to accompany her on her various errands. She was at\nfirst unwilling to accept his escort--it too clearly resembled a tacit\nconsent to his idleness. But his quiet persistence, together with\nhis evident cynicism as to the results of these professional tours,\naccomplished, as usual, his end; and the wondering village might observe\non hot June mornings its benefactress, languidly accompanied by a\nslender man in white flannels, balancing a large white green-lined\numbrella, picking his way daintily along the dusty paths, with a covered\nbasket dangling from one hand and a gray-green volume distending one\nwhite pocket.\n\nThere was material, too, for the interested observer in the picture of\nMiss Gould distributing reading matter, fruit, and lectures on household\neconomy in the cottages of the mill-hands, while her lodger pitched\npennies with the delighted children outside. It was on one of these\noccasions that Miss Gould took the opportunity to address Mr. Thomas\nWaters, late of the paper and cardboard manufacturing force, on the\nwickedness and folly of his present course of action. Mr. Waters had\nleft his position on the strength of his wife's financial success.\nMrs. Waters was a laundress, and the summer boarders, together with\nMr. Welles, who alone went far toward establishing the fortunes of\nthe family, had combined to place the head of the house in his present\ncondition of elegant leisure. \u201cI wonder at you, Tom Waters, after all\nthe interest we've taken in you \\ Are you not horribly ashamed to depend\non your wife in this lazy way?\u201d Miss Gould demanded of the once member\nof the Reformed Drunkards' League. \u201cHow many times have I explained to\nyou that nothing--absolutely nothing--is so disgraceful as a man who\nwill not work? What were you placed in the world for? How do you justify\nyour existence?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow,\u201d replied her unabashed audience, with a wave of his pipe toward\nthe front yard, where Mr. Welles was amiably superintending a wrestling\nmatch, \u201cdoes he justify hisn?\u201d\n\nHad Miss Gould been less consistent and less in earnest, there were many\nreplies open to her. As it was, she colored violently, bit her lip,\nmade an inaudible remark, and with a bitter glance at the author of\nher confusion, now cheering on to the conflict the scrambling Waters\nchildren, she called their mother to account for their presence in the\nyard at this time on a school-day, and for the first time in her life\nleft the house without exacting a solemn promise of amendment from the\nhead of the family.\n\n\u201cI guess I fixed her that time!\u201d Mr. Waters remarked triumphantly, as he\nsummoned his second pair of twins from the yard and demanded of them if\nthe gentleman had given them nickels or dimes.\n\nThe gentleman in question became uncomfortably conscious, in the course\nof their walk home, of an atmosphere not wholly novel, that lost no\nstrength in this case from its studied repression. That afternoon, as\nthey sat in the shade of the big elm, he in his flexible wicker chair,\nshe in a straight-backed, high-seated legacy from her grandfather, the\nwhirlwind that Mr. Waters had so lightly sown fell to the reaping of a\nvictim too amiable and unsuspecting not to escape the sentence of any\nbut so stern a judge as the handsome and inflexible representative of\nthe moral order now before him.\n\nMiss Gould was looking her best in a crisp lavender dimity, upon whose\nfrills Mrs. Waters had bestowed the grateful exercise of her highest\nart. Her sleek, dark coils of hair, from which no one stray lock\nescaped, framed her fresh cheeks most admirably; her strong white\nhands appeared and disappeared with an absolute regularity through\nthe dark-green wool out of which she was evolving a hideous and useful\nshawl. To her lodger, who alternately waved a palm-leaf fan and drank\nlemonade, reading at intervals from a two-days-old newspaper, and\ncarrying on the desultory and amusing soliloquy that they were pleased\nto consider conversation, she presented the most attractive of pictures.\n\u201cSo firm, so positive, so wholesome,\u201d he murmured to himself, calling\nher attention to the exquisite effect of the slanting rays that struck\nthe lawn in a dappled pattern of flickering leaf-shadows, and remarking\nthe violet tinge thrown by the setting sun on the old spire below in the\nmiddle of the village. She did not answer immediately, and when she did\nit was in tones that he had learned from various slight experiments to\nregard as final.\n\n\u201cMr. Welles,\u201d she said, bending upon him that direct and placid regard\nthat rendered evasion difficult and paltering impossible, \u201cthings have\ncome to a point;\u201d and she narrated the scene of the morning.\n\n\u201cIt is indeed a problem,\u201d observed her lodger gravely, \u201cbut what is one\nto do? It is just such questions as this that illustrate the futility--\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no question about it, Mr. Welles,\u201d she interrupted gravely.\n\u201cTom was right and I was wrong. There is no use in my talking to him or\nanybody while I--while you--while things are as they are. You must make\nup your mind, Mr. Welles.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, great heavens, dear Miss Gould, what do you mean? What am I\nto make up my mind about? Am I to provide myself with an occupation,\nperhaps, for the sake of Tom Waters's principles? Or am I--\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. That is just it. You know what I have always felt, Mr. Welles,\nabout it. But I never seemed to be able to make you see. Now, as I say,\nthings have come to a point. You must do something.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is absurd, Miss Gould! I am not a child, and surely nobody can\ndream of holding you in any way responsible--\u201d\n\n\u201c_I_ hold myself responsible,\u201d she replied simply, \u201cand I have never\napproved of it--never!\u201d\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders desperately. She was imperturbable; she was\nimpossible; she was beyond argument or persuasion or ridicule.\n\n\u201cSuppose I say that I think the situation is absurd, and that I refuse\nto be placed at Mr. Waters's disposal?\u201d he suggested with a furtive\nglance. She drew the ivory hook through the green meshes a little\nfaster.\n\n\u201cI should be obliged to refuse to renew your lease in the fall,\u201d she\nanswered. He started from his wicker chair.\n\n\u201cYou cannot mean it, Miss Gould! You would not be so--so unkind, so\nunjust!\u201d\n\n\u201cI should feel obliged to, Mr. Welles, and I should not feel unjust.\u201d\n\nHe sank back into the yielding chair with a sigh. After all, her\nfascination had always lain in her great decision. Was it not illogical\nto expect her to fail to display it at such a crisis? There was a long\nsilence. The sun sank lower and lower, the birds twittered happily\naround them. Miss Gould's long white hook slipped in and out of the\nwool, and her lodger's eyes followed it absently. After a while he rose,\nsettled his white jacket elaborately, and half turned as if to go back\nto the house.\n\n\u201cI need not tell you how I regret this unfortunate decision of yours,\u201d\n he said politely, with a slight touch of the hauteur that sat so well on\nhis graceful person. \u201cI can only say that I am sorry you yourself should\nregret it so little, and that I hope it will not disturb our pleasant\nacquaintance during the weeks that remain to me.\u201d\n\nShe bowed slightly with a dignified gesture that often served her as a\nreply, and he took a step toward her.\n\n\u201cWould we not better come in?\u201d he suggested. \u201cThe sun is gone, and your\ndress is thin. Let me send Henry after the chairs,\u201d and his eyes dropped\nto her hands again. They were nearly hidden by the green wool, but the\nlong needle quivered like a leaf in the wind; she could not pass it\nbetween the thread and her white forefinger. He hesitated a moment,\nglanced at her face, smiled inscrutably, and deliberately reseated\nhimself.\n\n\u201cWhat in the world could I do, you see?\u201d he inquired meditatively, as if\nthat had been the subject under discussion for some time. \u201cI can't\nmake cardboard boxes, you know. It's perfectly useless, my going into a\nfactory. Wheels and belts and things always give me the maddest\nlonging to jump into them--I couldn't resist it! And that would be so\nunpleasant--\u201d\n\nShe dropped her wool and clasped her hands under it.\n\n\u201cOh, Mr. Welles,\u201d she cried eagerly, \u201chow absurd! As if I meant that! As\nif I meant anything like it!\u201d\n\n\u201cHad you thought of anything, then?\u201d he asked interestedly.\n\nShe nodded gravely. \u201cWhy, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wouldn't be right for me\nto say you must do something, and then offer no suggestions whatever,\nknowing as I do how you feel about it. I thought of such a good plan,\nand one that would be the best possible answer to Tom--\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, good heavens!\u201d murmured her lodger, but she went on quickly: \u201cYou\nknow I was going to open the soup-kitchen in October. Well, I've just\nthought, Why not get the Rooms all ready, and the reading-room moved\nover there, and have lemonade and sandwiches and sarsaparilla, and\nKitty Waters to begin to serve right away, as she's beginning to run the\nstreets again, and Annabel Riley with her? Then the Civic Club can have\nits headquarters there, and people will begin to be used to it before\ncold weather.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I am to serve sarsaparilla and sandwiches with Kitty and Annabel?\nReally, dear Miss Gould, if you knew how horribly ill sarsaparilla is\ncertain to make me--I have loathed it from childhood--\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no, no, no!\u201d she interrupted, with her sweet, tolerant smile. She\nsmiled at him as if he had been a child.\n\n\u201cYou know I never meant that you should work all day, Mr. Welles. It\nisn't at all necessary. I have always felt that an hour or two a day of\nintelligent, cultivated work was fully equal to a much longer space of\nmanual labor that is more mechanical, more tiresome.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter fifty years of poker than a cycle of croquet!\u201d her lodger\nmurmured. \u201cYes, I have always felt that myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd somebody must be there from ten to twelve, say, in the mornings,\nin what we call the office; just to keep an eye on things, and answer\nquestions about the kitchen, and watch the reading-room, and recommend\nthe periodicals, and take the children's Civic League reports, and\noversee the Rooms generally. Now I'd be there Wednesdays to meet the\nmothers, and Mrs. Underwood Saturdays for the Band of Hope and the\nkitchen-garden. It would be just Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and\nFridays from ten to twelve, say!\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom ten to twelve, say,\u201d he repeated absently, with his eyes on her\nhandsome, eager face. He had never seen her so animated, so girlishly\ninsistent. She urged with the vivid earnestness of twenty years.\n\n\u201cMy dear lady,\u201d he brought out finally, \u201cyou are like Greek architecture\nor Eastlake furniture or--or 'God Save the Queen'--perfectly absolute!\nAnd I am so hideously relative--But, after all, why should a sense of\nhumor be an essential? One is really more complete--I suppose Mahomet\nhad none--When shall I begin?\u201d\n\nThe interested villagers were informed early and regularly of the\nprogress of the latest scheme of their benefactress. Henry and Mr.\nWaters furnished most satisfactory and detailed bulletins to gatherings\nof leisurely and congenial spirits, who listened with incredulous\namazement to the accounts of Mr. Welles's proceedings.\n\n\u201cHim an' that hired man o' his, they have took more stuff over to them\nRooms than you c'd shake a stick at! I never see nothing like it--never!\nWaxed that floor, they have, and put more mats onto it--fur and colored.\nAn' the stuff--oh, Lord! China--all that blue china he got fr'm ol' Mis'\nSimms, an' them ol' stoneware platters that Mis' Rivers was goin' to\nfire away, an' he give her two dollars for the lot--all that's scattered\nround on tables and shelves. An' that ol' black secr'tary he got fr'm\nLord knows where, an' brakes growin' in colored pots standin' right up\nthere, an' statyers o' men an' women--no heads onto 'em, some ain't got;\nit's all one to him--he'd buy any ol' thing so's 'twas broke, you might\nsay. An' them ol' straight chairs--no upholsterin' on 'em, an' some o'\nthem wicker kind that bends any way, with piliers in 'em. An' cups and\nsassers, with a tea-pot 'n' kittle; an' he makes tea himself an' drinks\nit--I swear it's so. An' a guitar, an', Lord, the pictures! You can't\nsee no wall for 'em!\n\n\u201c'It's a mighty lucky thing, havin' this room, Thompson,' says he to\nthat hired man, 'the things was spillin' over. We'll make it a bower o'\nbeauty, Thompson,' says he. 'Yes, sir,' says the man. That's all he ever\nsays, you might say. I never see nothin' like it, never, the way that\nhired man talks to him; you'd think he was the Queen o' Sheba.\n\n\u201cAn' he goes squintin' about here an' there, changin' this an' that, an'\nsingin' away an' laughin'--you'd think he'd have a fit. Seems's if he\nloved to putter about 'n' fool with things in a room, like women.\nI heard him say so myself. I was helpin' Miss Gould with the other\nrooms--she ain't seen his; she don't know no more'n the dead what he's\ngot in there--an' I was by the door when he said it.\n\n\u201c'Thompson,' says he, 'if I don't keep my present situation,' says he,\n'I c'n go out as a decorator an' furnisher. Don't you think I'd succeed,\nThompson?' says he. 'Yes, sir,' says Thompson.\n\n\u201c'You see, we've got to do something Thompson,' says he. 'We've got ter\njustify our existence, Thompson,' an' he commenced to laugh. 'Yes, sir,'\nsays Thompson. Beats all I ever see, the way that man answers back!\u201d\n\nAn almost unprecedented headache, brought on by her unremitting labor in\neffecting the change in the Rooms, kept Miss Gould in the house for two\ndays after the new headquarters had been satisfactorily arranged; and\nas Mr. Welles had refused to open his office for inspection till it was\ncompletely furnished, she did not enter that characteristic apartment\ntill the third day of its official existence.\n\nAs she went through the narrow hallway connecting the four rooms on\nwhich the social regeneration of her village depended, she caught the\nsweet low thrum of a guitar and a too familiarly seductive voice burst\nforth into a chant, whose literal significance she was unable to grasp,\nowing to lack of familiarity with the language in which it was couched,\nbut whose general tenor no one could mistake, so tender and arch was the\nrendering.\n\nWith a vague thrill of apprehension she threw open the door.\n\nSunk in cushions, a tea-cup on the arm of his chair, a guitar resting on\nhis white flannel sleeve, reclined the director of the Rooms. Over\nhis head hung a large and exquisite copy of the Botticelli Venus.\nMiss Gould's horrified gaze fled from this work of art to rest on a\nrepresentation in bronze of the same reprehensible goddess, clothed,\nto be sure, a little more in accordance with the views of a retired New\nEngland community, yet leaving much to be desired in this direction.\nKitty Waters attentively filled his empty cup, beaming the while, and\nthe once errant Annabel, sitting on a low stool at his feet, with a red\nbow in her pretty hair, and her great brown eyes fixed adoringly on\nhis face as he directed the fascinating incomprehensible little song\nstraight at her charming self, was obviously in no present danger of\nrunning the streets.\n\n\u201cGood morning, Miss Gould!\u201d he said cheerfully, rising and handing the\nguitar to the abashed Annabel. \u201cAnd you are really quite recovered?\n_C'est bien!_ Business is dull, and we are amusing each other, you see.\nHow do you like the rooms? I flatter myself--\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you flattered none but yourself, Mr. Welles, much harm would be\navoided,\u201d she interrupted with uncompromising directness. \u201cKitty and\nAnnabel, I cannot see how you can possibly tell how many people may or\nmay not be wanting lunch!\u201d\n\n\u201cBilly Rider tells us when any one comes,\u201d the director assured her.\n\u201cThey don't come till twelve, anyway, and then they want to see the\nroom, mostly--which we show them, don't we, Annabel?\u201d\n\nAnnabel blushed, cast down her eyes, lifted them, showed her dimples,\nand replied in the words, if not in the accents, of Thompson: \u201cYes,\nsir!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's really going to be an education in itself, don't you think so?\u201d\n he continued. \u201cIt's amazing how the people like it--it's really quite\ngratifying. Perhaps it may be my mission to abolish the chromo and the\ntidy from off the face of New England! We have had crowds here--just to\nlook at the pictures.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't doubt it!\u201d replied Miss Gould briefly.\n\n\u201cAnd I got the most attractive sugar-bowl from the little boy who\nbrought in the reports about picking up papers and such things from the\nstreets. He said he ought to have five cents, so I gave him a dime--I\nhadn't five--and I bought the bowl. Annabel, my child, bring me--\u201d\n\nBut Annabel and her fellow-waitress had disappeared. Miss Gould sat in\nsilence. At intervals her perplexed gaze rested unconsciously on the\nBotticelli Venus, from which she instantly with a slight frown lowered\nit and regarded the floor. When she at last met his eyes the expression\nof her own was so troubled, the droop of her firm mouth so pathetic\nand unusual, that he left his chair and dragged the little stool to\nher feet, assuming an attitude so boyish and graceful that in spite of\nherself she smiled at him.\n\n\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d he asked confidentially. \u201cIs anything wrong?\nDon't you like the room? I enjoy it tremendously, myself. I've been\nhere almost all the time since it was done. I think Tom Waters must be\ntremendously impressed--\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's the trouble; he is,\u201d said Miss Gould simply.\n\n\u201cTrouble? trouble? Is his impression unfavorable? Heavens,\nhow unfortunate!\u201d exclaimed the director airily. \u201cSurely, my\napplication--Does the room fail to meet his approval, or--\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it does,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cHe says it's no place for a man to be\nin; and he says the pictures are--are--well, he says they are improper!\u201d\n glancing at the Venus.\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d responded the director with a suspicious sweetness. \u201cHe does not\ncare for the nude, then?\u201d\n\nShe sighed deeply. \u201cOh, Mr. Welles!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is indeed to be regretted that Mr. Waters's ideals are so\nhigh--and--shall we say--so elusive?\u201d proceeded the director smoothly.\n\u201cIt is so difficult--so well-nigh impossible--to satisfy him. One\ndevotes one's energies--I may say one slaves night and day--to win\nsome slight mark of approval; and just as one is about to reap the\nwell-earned reward--a smile, a word of appreciation--all is forfeited!\nIt is hard indeed! Would you suggest the rearrangement of the Rooms\nunder Mr. Waters's direction? Thompson is at his service--\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Mr. Welles!\u201d she sighed hopelessly. \u201cIt isn't only that! It's not\nalone the room, though Mrs. Underwood wonders that I should think she\nwould be able to conduct the Band of Hope in here, and Mrs. Rider says\nthat after what her husband told her she should no more think of sitting\nhere for a mothers' meeting than anything in the world. It's the whole\nthing. Why did you treat them all to lemonade the first day? Surely you\nknew that our one aim is to prevent miscellaneous charity. And Tom says\nyou smoked in here--he smelt it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI smelt him, too,\u201d remarked the director calmly. \u201cThat was one reason\nwhy I smoked.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd--and having Kitty and Annabel here all the time! The Girls' Club\nare so j---- Well, the Girls' Club like the old rooms better, they say,\nand it's so difficult to get them to work together at best. And now we\nshall have to work so hard--\n\n\u201cAnd the men think it's just a joke, the lemonade and everything, and\nthe room gave them such a wrong impression, and they don't seem to want\nit, anyway. Tom Waters says he can't abide sarsaparilla--\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat heavens!\u201d the director broke in, \u201cis it possible? A point on\nwhich Mr. Waters's opinion coincides with mine? I have not lived in\nvain! But this is too much; I have not deserved--\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don't!\u201d she begged. \u201cThere is more. When I corrected Annabel for\nwhat I had heard about her--her impertinent behavior, she said that\nMrs. Underwood had never approved of the whole thing, and that if I had\nconsulted her she would never have given her consent to your being here,\nand that I was dictatorial--I!\u201d\n\nHer lodger coughed and ejaculated, \u201cYou, indeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when I said that their ingratitude actually made me wonder why I\nworked so hard for them, she said--oh, dear! It is all dreadful! I don't\nknow what to do!\u201d\n\n\u201cI do!\u201d returned her lodger promptly. \u201cGo away and leave 'em! They\naren't fit to trouble you any more. Besides, they're really not so\nbad, after all, you know. There has to be just about so much laziness\nand--and that sort of thing, don't you see. Look at me, for instance!\nThink of how much misdirected energy I balance! And it gives other\npeople something to do.... Go away and leave it all for a while!\u201d he\nrepeated smilingly.\n\n\u201cGo away! But where? Why should I? What do you mean?\u201d she stammered,\nconfused at something in his eyes, which never left her face.\n\n\u201cTo England--you said you'd like to see it. With me--for I certainly\ncouldn't stay here alone. Why do you suppose I stay, dear lady? I used\nto wonder myself. No, sit still, don't get up! I am about to make you an\noffer of marriage; indeed, I am serious, Miss Gould!\n\n\u201cI don't see that it's ridiculous at all. I see every practical reason\nin favor of it. In the first place, if they are gossiping--oh, yes,\nThompson told me, and I wonder that they hadn't before: these villages\nare dreadful places--I couldn't very well stay, you see; and then where\nshould I put all my things? In the second place, I have so much stuff,\nand there's no house fit for it but--but ours; and if we were married I\ncould have just twice as much room for it--and I'm getting far too much\nfor my side. In the third place, I find that I can't look forward with\nany pleasure to travelling about alone, because, in the fourth place,\nI've grown so tremendously fond of you, dear Miss Gould! I think you\ndon't dislike me?\u201d\n\nShe plucked the guitar strings nervously with her white, strong fingers.\nThe rich, vibrating tones of it filled the room and confused her still\nmore.\n\n\u201cPeople will say that I--that we--\u201d He caught her hand: it had never\nbeen kissed before. \u201cWould you rather I went away and then there would\nbe nothing left for them to say?\u201d he asked softly.\n\nShe caught her breath.\n\n\u201cI'm too--\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are too charming not to have some one who appreciates the fact as\nthoroughly as I do,\u201d he interrupted gallantly. \u201cI think you do me so\nmuch good, you know,\u201d he added, still holding her hand. She looked at\nhim directly for the first time.\n\n\u201cDo I really? Is that true?\u201d she demanded, with a return of her old\nmanner so complete and sudden as to startle him. \u201cIf I thought that--\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would?\u201d he asked with a smile. \u201cI thought so! Here is a village\nthat scorns your efforts and a respectful suitor who implores them. Can\nyou hesitate?\u201d\n\nHis smile was irresistible, and she returned it half reprovingly. \u201cWill\nyou never be serious?\u201d she said. \u201cI wonder that I can--\u201d She stopped.\n\n\u201cThat you can--\u201d he repeated, watching her blush, but she would not\nfinish.\n\n\u201cYou must not think that I can give up my work--my real work--so\neasily,\u201d she said, rising and looking down on him with a return of her\nsimple impressive seriousness. \u201cI shall have to consider. I have been\nvery much disturbed by their conduct. I will see you after supper,\u201d and\nwith a gesture that told him to remain, she left the room, her head\nhigh as she caught Annabel's voice from outside. She turned in the door,\nhowever, and the stern curves of her mouth melted with a smile so sweet,\na promise so gracious and so tender, that when her eyes, frank and\ndirect as a boy's, left his, he looked long at the closed door,\nwondering at the quickening of his pulses.\n\nA moment later he heard her voice, imperious and clear, and the mumble\nof Mr. Waters's unavailing if never-ending excuses. He laughed softly to\nhimself, and touched the strings of the guitar that she had struck.\n\u201cI shall save the worthy Thomas much,\u201d he murmured to himself, \u201cand of\ncourse I do it to reform her--I cannot pull down the village and die\nwith the Philistines!\u201d\n\nShe went up the long main street, Mr. Waters at her side and Annabel\nRiley behind her. Her lodger watched her out of sight, and prepared to\nlock up the Rooms.\n\n\u201cSo firm, so positive, so wholesome!\u201d he said, as he started after her.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
