    "body": "Cargyle wiped away the blood from a flesh wound over one eye. The body\nof a mutineer lay half across the threshold of the small cabin. They'd\ngotten that close to him. They were out there in the corridors, the\nmutineers, searching out the officers ... killing them.\n\nFar off in the rocket ship a burst of firing broke out. A chorus of\nwild yelling began, muted by distance and the intervening walls.\nCargyle listened intently; perhaps a stand was being made against the\ncrew! The sounds seemed to come from the control room. He hesitated,\nstaring through the heavy port in the hull at the still stars in the\nblackness beyond. If there were officers still defending the pilot\nroom, his place was with them. But if the mutineers were in possession,\nhe'd be going to his death. With a shrug, he pressed a concealed button\nset in the wall. A panel of the inner wall of the hull slid quietly\nopen. Tucking his blastor pistol into his belt, Cargyle crawled into\nthe space revealed.\n\nAll space cruisers were equipped with passages like this, known only to\nthe officers: in the long monotonous months in space tension between\nmen would sometimes sweep up to murderous frenzy, and mutinies were not\nuncommon.\n\nMutiny on the _Denebola_ had been long coming. They were returning from\na three-year surveying and specimen-collecting expedition among the\nasteroids. Sent out by the Cranford Foundation, they had outfitted in\nthe Martian colony of Tracolatown.\n\nLoneliness and monotony change men queerly, undermine character\nand sanity. And three years is a long time. Quarrels flared up and\nbecame feuds. Between two members of the crew, Kalson and Wrymore, a\nparticularly bitter hatred developed.\n\nThe crew were permitted no weapons, but Kalson was found shot to death.\nThe crew and their quarters were searched by the officers. No weapons\nwere found. There are many places small side arms can be hidden in the\nlength of a ship.\n\nCaptain Wallace didn't confine Wrymore, for there was no definite proof\nof his guilt. But he informed him he would be turned over for trial at\nthe first port reached.\n\nThen there was the starboard-dorsal rocket jet, forever threatening\ndisintegration, which no amount of tinkering ever made right. At any\nunusual sound the crew would freeze, their expressions set. Had that\njet gone at last?\n\nBut with all this Wallace could cope. A stern man, old in the service,\nhe was fully capable of controlling a crew unnerved by the ceaseless\nwatching of infinity. He strode through the ship, as stern and calm as\nthough in his office on Earth, holding the men to their duty, their\nsanity.\n\nBut when the \"flame of all colors\" appeared....\n\n\n\nThe _Denebola_ pointed her sharp nose homeward; the frozen, dead lumps\nof the asteroids dropped behind. A new and clearer expression found its\nway to the faces of the crew.\n\nAnd then Wrymore flung himself out of a storage compartment, where\nhe'd been sent for a replacement part during one of the interminable\nrepair jobs on the rocket jet. He dashed into the engine room, and the\nastonished engineers dragged him from behind a convertor, a trembling\nwreck of a man, near to madness. He told them Kalson's ghost was in the\nstorage cabin--he'd seen it, a crawling flame-like thing, in which all\nthe colors of the spectrum flickered and twined.\n\nThey put him in sick bay--and the next \"day\" an electrician calmly\nreported to the officer on watch the presence of \"a funny-colored\nthing something like a slow flame\" in the forward thermal chamber.\nInvestigation revealed nothing but the inexplicable presence of an\namount of hydrogen gas.\n\nThe ship seemed haunted. Men saw, or thought they saw, queer flames in\nevery corner. Captain Wallace wondered if they were all going mad. Only\nhe and Cargyle had yet to see the things. What was worse, things were\ndisappearing--tools, supplies, replacement parts. More hydrogen made\nits appearance.\n\nThe effect of all this on the already teetering crew can be imagined.\nCaptain Wallace left the problem of the mysterious flames to Calvin\nMarkoe, the astrophysicist appointed by the Cranford people, and\ndevoted himself to keeping the crew in hand.\n\nBut for the first time Wallace found himself helpless to stem the\ntide. The crew were too far gone, too fear-harried and space-crazy to\nknow reason or fear punishment. And when corroded-looking holes began\nappearing in the walls of the ship, the mutiny burst out with all the\nsavageness and fury of madness long suppressed.\n\nCargyle, the second officer, charged by a yelling, wild-eyed mob of\ncrazy murderers, fought them coldly, shooting with deadly precision.\nHis slow retreat brought him to the little cabin, where his position\nwas almost impregnable, and which he knew connected through the secret\npassage with the control cabin.\n\nHe grinned as he crawled along the passage. What would the mutineers\nthink when they charged the cabin and found it empty? They'd be sure\nthe ship was haunted.\n\nIt was black as the Coal-Sack in the low-ceilinged tunnel. When a dim,\nelusive light began forming ahead of him, he first thought it a trick\nof his eyes, but as the thing brightened Cargyle halted and stared in\namazement. At last he, too, was seeing one of the haunting flames.\n\nIn shape the thing did somewhat suggest a flame, but such a flame as\nnever seen before. It was a writhing mozaic of colors that twined and\nfaded one into the other. It curled as he watched, and the gleaming tip\nbowed slowly until it touched the floor. The thing lay flat, pulsing\nslowly with a gorgeous display of color.\n\nCargyle forgot the mutineers, the beleagured officers. In sheer\nbewilderment he watched the deliberate, enigmatic movements of the\nthing before him.\n\nIn all his wandering through the system he had never seen anything\nlike this. What was it? A phenomenon of space, heretofore unknown, or\nwas it--alive? The tip of the thing, bent to the floor, was moving\ndelicately in small circles, touching and retreating, almost in the\nmanner of a caterpillar on a leaf.\n\nCargyle was crouched on one knee. Abruptly his foot slipped, the heel\ncoming down hard on the metal floor. The resultant clangor in that\nnarrow tube was deafening. The flame-like entity sprang vibrantly\nerect. A huge red bubble, swelling, emerged from somewhere within its\nbody and wound upward through vellicating strands of color. The thing\npaused there, its inner wonder of radiant light in flickering, nervous\nagitation. The tip, aloft again, twisted and writhed, once forming a\nsuperb, faultless spiral of brilliant scarlet.\n\n\n\nThe next moment it was moving toward him, and Cargyle, who had faced\nundaunted the thousand dangers, the unearthly foes of the spaceman,\nfound himself shaking with a resistless horror.\n\nFurious at himself, he took deliberate aim, and fired.\n\nIf the slip of his foot had been thunderous, the sound that followed\nthe discharge of the blastor pistol was as that of worlds coming\ntogether. The walls of the passage shivered to the detonation, so\nterrific that an entrance door to the passage burst from its hinges,\nand fell into the cabin on which it opened.\n\nDeafened, and blinded by the sudden flash, Cargyle waited helplessly.\nWhen his vision cleared he stared eagerly down the corridor. The\nflame-thing was where he had seen it last, motionless, unharmed!\n\nAs he stared in astonishment a roll of emerald smoke seemed to eddy\nunder its surface, and it moved toward him. A recurrent wave of that\nstrange horror surged through Cargyle. What _was_ this thing? Was it\nsentient--did it perceive and threaten him?\n\nHe thrust his pistol back in his belt--apparently it was useless\nagainst whatever stood before him--and started grimly forward. The\nthing waited, pale colors flowing fluidly through it. Suddenly it\nseemed to thin and tower and in its middle a ring appeared--a ring of\ndead black--and from that ring burst a blast of light; an intolerable,\nblinding beam that flamed in the very core of Cargyle's brain. Agony\nseared through him, rose to a piercing crescendo. Then a merciful\nblackness engulfed him, and the second officer crumpled to the floor.\nThe flame-thing took up its incessant tapping and probing.\n\n\n\n\"Well,\" said Wallace. \"We thought you were dead. What did they do to\nyou? There's no wound; apparently no injury. But you were as close to\ndeath as a man can get, and still come back. What happened?\"\n\nCargyle choked and coughed. His brain and chest were burning agony.\nDimly he struggled, and the flow of raw oxygen that was making him gasp\nceased. The pain in his head was going. As the space-helmet was pulled\noff, he found himself regarding Captain Wallace and the astrophysicist,\nMarkoe. They helped him to his feet, held him while he wavered back and\nforth unsteadily.\n\n\"The light--the light from the flame-thing,\" stammered Cargyle.\n\n\"It attacked you?\" Markoe caught his arm. \"How?\"\n\n\"A light--a ray of some kind. Shot it into me. I was coming through\nthe starboard passage ... heard firing ... the mutineers ... where are\nthey? Where's the crew?\"\n\n\"They've gone mad completely,\" said Wallace. \"We held them off at the\npilot cabin--all the officers and a few loyal men are with me--and\nafter an hour or so they went away. Half hour later we saw them through\na port. They deserted in the two scouting rockets. What's left of the\ncrew must have crowded into the two small ships; we didn't find a\nliving man when we explored the ship. Except you. Where they expect to\ngo, God knows. With a normal crew of four the air in a scout rocket is\ngood for only about five days. Crowded they won't last two, and Mars is\nit least a week away.\"\n\n\"How did you know that oxygen would bring me back?\" asked Cargyle.\nThey had started back toward the pilot room.\n\n\"Didn't,\" replied Wallace. \"Markoe and I were inspecting the ship--we\nhad to wear space-suits aft of the main air renewer. The whole stern of\nthe ship's riddled. These flame-things doing it, Markoe says. We've got\nall the compartments closed off, but if he's right, the _Denebola's_\nthrough. We found you on our way back. Looked as though you were\ndead. But we tried the oxygen from one of the helmets on you, and it\neventually brought you around.\n\n\"What are they?\" Cargyle asked. \"These flames? Are they alive?\"\n\n\"If they are,\" said Markoe, \"they're like no kind of life ever known\nbefore. They set up a powerful field of some kind. I've been studying\nthem back there in the stern. Trying to find out what they are.\" He\nheld up some equipment--coils, and a detector.\n\n\"I turned a blastor pistol on one,\" said Cargyle. \"It was only ten feet\naway--I couldn't have missed. And the thing never moved!\"\n\nA thunder of running feet brought the three men to a sudden halt. The\nnext instant a man charged out of a side passage. At sight of them he\nhalted and one glance at his face told them he was hopelessly insane.\nHis eyes blazed with madness, and a line of foam ringed his mouth. In\none hand he held a gun.\n\n\"Kalson!\" he screamed at them. \"He's following me! He's dead! I killed\nhim once! But he's here! I'm going to open the port and let the air\nout! Then Kalson won't follow me. I'll kill him again! Then I won't see\nhim crawling ... and crawling....\"\n\nHe wheeled and ran down the corridor.\n\n\"It's Wrymore!\" gasped Captain Wallace. \"I thought he'd gone with the\nrest. Come on! We've got to stop him!\"\n\nThe three raced down the corridor after the madman, who had disappeared\ninto the main passage leading to the 'midships airlock. They reached\nthe corridor together and wheeled into it. There at their feet lay\nWrymore--they almost fell over him.\n\nMarkoe turned the man over. \"He's dead!\" he exclaimed. \"What could\nhave--\"\n\n\"Fright, I suppose,\" said Wallace. \"Look.\"\n\n\n\nThey followed his gaze along the corridor. There, on the deck in the\ncenter of the passage, slender, mobile tip questing and probing, lay\none of the flame-things. Markoe and the captain drew their pistols, but\nCargyle, who had already one experience with these glowing enigmas,\nseized their arms.\n\n\"It's no good,\" he whispered. \"Come away. It's no good. You can't hurt\nthem.\"\n\n\"Well, by the Star of Saffta, I'm going to try,\" retorted Wallace,\nand he swung up his gun. The next moment the cavernous passage-way\nroared and trembled to the blaster's discharge, and the hissing uproar\nwas intensified as Markoe fired in turn. The flame-thing sprang\nupright--grew longer--towered high above them.\n\n\"Run!\" snapped Cargyle, diving into the side passage.\n\nBut the other two, struck with astonishment, stood where they were.\nCargyle, peering cautiously around the corner, saw that ominous,\ndead-black ring in the flame-thing's middle.\n\nBefore he could draw back the intense and brilliant beam sprang out\nof the black ring, but this time it struck at Wallace and Markoe, and\nCargyle, although momentarily blinded, was not subjected to the tearing\npain that had snuffed out his consciousness. When he could see again,\nhe perceived his companions sprawled on the deck--to all appearances,\ndead. Their attacker was again pursuing its endless testing of the\nfloor.\n\nWould the thing strike at him if he went to his companions' assistance?\nCargyle shrugged. He'd have to take that chance.\n\nCautiously he moved out into the passage. Except for a noticeable\nincrease in the rapidity of the pulsation of its shifting colors,\nthe flame-thing ignored him. As quietly as possible he dragged first\nCaptain Wallace and then the astrophysicist back into the shelter of\nthe side passage.\n\nWhat in God's Name were these flame-things, Cargyle wondered. They\nappeared to recognize and resent attack. They _must_ be alive! Where\nhad they come from, and was Markoe right? Were they slowly destroying\nthe _Denebola_?\n\nBut he had no time for such questions now. He ran back to the\nspace-suit, dropped when Wrymore had appeared, and got the helmet and\nits oxygen tank. Captain Wallace looked lifeless; he was waxen-white\nand unbreathing. But there was a faint heart-action. Cargyle thrust the\nhelmet over his head, and turned the flow-control.\n\nHe sat there an hour or more, and he thought the oxygen tank would have\nemptied before Markoe showed signs of life.\n\nBoth men were still dazed when they entered the pilot room. While\nCargyle explained what had happened to them, and the manner of his own\nsurvival, his glance noted the signs of battle. Blackened pits, marks\nof blastor discharges, spattered the walls and furniture. Equipment had\nbeen shattered by chance shots. The inner lens of one of the ports had\nbeen drilled through the center, long cracks radiating from the spot.\nIt had been hastily repaired, fused together with _thurlite_.\n\nMost of the men wore bloody bandages, and one lay unconscious. Chapman,\nthe chief pilot, was pacing nervously back and forth before the dead\ncontrol board; the other men were now dropping back into attitudes of\nlistless dejection.\n\n\"Why are we drifting?\" Cargyle asked. The ship was silent,\nvibrationless. All rockets were inoperative--they were sweeping\nhelplessly through space, undirected.\n\n\"Why?\" growled Simms. \"Because those crazy devils took as much fuel as\nthey could and then drained the tanks. We're falling into an orbit--\"\n\n\"Speed?\"\n\n\"Roughly ten per second. We were trying to contact Tracolatown, but the\nmutineers smashed the hull plates. Parker and Swift are out on the hull\nnow, working on the plates.\"\n\n\"Then we're--\"\n\n\"We're sunk, unless we can fix those plates and get a patrol ship out\nto us.\"\n\n\n\nA red light over the viso-set winked, and then glowed steadily.\nBarfield, the viso operator, sprang to his control board and swiftly\nmanipulated switches and dials. The viso-screen remained blank, but\nfrom the speaker came the familiar uproar produced by the vibrations\nthat flood space. Barfield swung the controls, seeking the wave-length\nof the station at Tracolatown.\n\n\"Calling the _Denebola_,\" said the speaker, hollowly, a moment later.\n\"Calling the _Denebola_ ... where are you, _Denebola_? 3TRA45 calling.\nTracolatown calling the _Denebola_.\"\n\n\"They've got those hull plates working, Captain,\" cried Barfield.\n\"That's the Martian operator, Nunglon! This is the _Denebola_,\nNunglon!\" he continued, speaking into the phone. \"The _Denebola_\ncalling Tracolatown! A mutiny ... the crew deserted. They drained our\ntanks and we're drifting. Here's our position--\" He turned to Chapman.\n\"What is the position?\"\n\nThe pilot began reading off the ship's co-ordinates. \"Send him those.\nThey're some hours old, but they can start on them, and correct course\nas soon as our present position is determined.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" interrupted Markoe. \"Wait a minute. We can't call a ship out\nhere. What about the flames?\"\n\nThey looked at him. In the silence two men in space-suits entered the\ncabin; stood still, surprised. \"What's the matter?\" asked one, crawling\nfrom his suit. \"The plates are working, ain't they? What's wrong?\"\n\n\"What's the flames got to do with it?\" demanded Simms. \"To hell with\nthe flames! We can transfer to the patrol ship if the _Denebola's_\ncompletely destroyed. We could even navigate her back in space-suits,\nif she'll still move. Go on, Barfield, send our position.\"\n\n\"Mr. Simms,\" said Wallace, quietly, \"I'll give the orders. We'll hear\nMr. Markoe's objection. What about the flames, sir?\"\n\n\"Just this, Captain,\" said Markoe. \"If we call a ship out here and\ntransfer to it, what's to stop these things from transfering, too? Any\nship that comes near us is done for, the same as the _Denebola_, unless\nwe find some way to destroy them.\"\n\n\"So you tell us,\" growled Simms. \"And ask us to sacrifice our lives\non your guesses. I won't do it, I tell you! You don't know what these\nthings are, or where they came from. You know nothing about them.\"\n\n\"They came from the asteroids, I believe,\" replied Markoe. \"Give me a\nday or two more. There must be some way of destroying them. And have\nyou forgotten the oath you took? The oath of the spaceman, never to\nreturn to port with an unknown disease that might become a plague?\nThese flames are included ... in the spirit of that oath, at least I\ntell you we can't call a ship's crew out here, possibly to their death!\"\n\n\"That's the answer,\" said Wallace, firmly. \"We call no other ship until\nthese things are gone. Operator, tell Tracolatown we'll call them\nlater. Markoe, it's up to you now.\"\n\n\"I can't tell Nunglon the ship's full of funny-colored flames,\"\nprotested Barfield. \"He'll think we're all space-crazy!\"\n\n\"Tell him we haven't our position--that we're working it out,\"\ninstructed Wallace. \"Tell him we're away off the ecliptic, and that it\nwill take time.\"\n\nFor the next three days they saw little of Markoe. He spent hours in\nthe airless stern of the ship, where he had set up a rough laboratory.\nOccasionally he appeared to renew the oxygen tank of his helmet. A\nglance at his face was sufficient. They asked him nothing.\n\nCargyle joined him frequently, and tried to be of assistance, but the\nastrophysicist's experiments meant little to the second officer.\n\nOnce Markoe turned to him and said, tensely, \"There's a wave-length, or\na modulation, that will break down their field. I know it! But how to\nfind it? How to find it in time!\"\n\n\"Markoe,\" said Cargyle, \"why haven't they attacked the control cabin?\nIt's the one compartment of the ship where you never see them. There\nmust be some reason.\"\n\nMarkoe looked at him a moment, then shook his head. \"Chance, that's\nall. They started in the tail of the ship, and they're working forward.\nThere's nothing in the pilot cabin to stop them. I've tried the\nviso-set's wave-lengths. Doesn't bother them.\"\n\nBut, unreasonably, Cargyle clung to the belief that there was something\nabout the control cabin....\n\n\n\nIn the high vacuum of those airless cabins there was no diffusion of\nlight--the shadows were deep, ink-black. Through the jagged holes in\nthe hull--where holes in the inner and outer skin coincided--entered\nfaint star-light; on Markoe's table dim lights gleamed; and everywhere\nthe gorgeous colors of the flame-things flickered. It was a weird and\neerie setting: a suitable background for the incredible beings that\nmoved against it.\n\nDanger was there also, which was the principle reason Cargyle spent\nso much time there. Should Markoe be struck down by one of the\nflame-things he might suffocate, if his oxygen tank was nearly empty,\nor turned off by the fall, before anyone came to him.\n\nBut the flame-things paid them little attention. The men moved little,\nand then slowly.\n\nThey watched them reproduce. A tiny branch flame would appear. At\nfirst it would be ochre-colored, but as it lengthened it acquired the\nprismatic character of its parent. Then, abruptly, it broke off, and\nwas a separate individual.\n\nIt was upon these \"infant\" flames that most of Markoe's experiments\nwere made--they were unable to discharge the paralyzing ray of their\nparents, and they could be moved about by persuading them to mount a\nloose piece of metal.\n\nOne cabin in the stern Cargyle avoided. It held the dead--a half dozen\nbodies laid side by side, each under a white sheet. In the sharp mosaic\nof pale light and deep shadow, these six glimmering shapes, austere\nand rigid in the final stillness of death, struck a cold foreboding\ninto the beholder. Preserved in the airless cold of space, there was\nsomething prophetic in their fixity.\n\nOn the third day the men closed off the last compartment. They were\nconfined now to the control room, unless they wished to visit Markoe's\nlaboratory, or roam the ship in space-suits.\n\nThe control cabin contained a separate plant for light, heat and\nair-renewal. Batteries, and a small generator operated by its own motor\nand tank of fuel, were banked beneath the floor. It constituted another\ndefense against mutineers.\n\nPeriodically Wallace took sights and computed their position. Simms\nmade no effort to relieve him. The chief officer had discarded coat and\ncap; dark hair, uncombed, hung across his forehead. From beneath it his\nshadowed eyes watched the captain sullenly.\n\nStrain marked them all. Some sat in hopeless silence; others restlessly\npaced the slow hours away. Parker, alone among those aboard the dying\n_Denebola_, seemed unaffected. He busied himself repairing the damaged\nequipment, devoting most of his time to the starboard dorsal rocket\ntimer, which resisted all his efforts. Although it sparked each time a\nterminal was contacted, something inside the timer was out of order,\nfor it boiled and hissed.\n\nOnce Simms snarled at him: \"Parker, you fool! Let it alone! What the\nhell's the use of that now?\"\n\nEach compartment was separated from the adjoining one by an airlock,\nleft open when both compartments contained an atmosphere. As Markoe and\nCargyle emerged from the airlock they heard Simms' voice.\n\n\"--and we're desperate, Captain,\" he was saying. \"You're got to call\nTracolatown and give them our position. Do you want us to die like\nrats? How much longer will these batteries last? Perhaps it's too late\nnow. Let Markoe stay here and play with these things if he wants. I'm\nnot!\"\n\n\"Mr. Simms, I've warned you once,\" said Wallace, sternly. \"If you\nforget yourself again, I shall place you under arrest.\"\n\n\"How do you know they will attack another ship, Captain Wallace?\"\njoined in Chapman. \"I agree with Simms. We're sacrificing our lives for\na trifle. Even if they should transfer with us, the patrol ship that\npicked us up could get back to Mars before they'd done much damage. Are\nyou going to kill us all to save a few holes in a patrol rocket's hull?\"\n\nOnly one feeble light burned in the pilot cabin; the others were\nextinguished to conserve power. Cargyle noticed the air had a thick,\ndry taste to it.\n\n\n\n\"I can answer some of those questions, with your permission, sir,\"\nsaid Markoe, stepping forward. Wallace nodded. \"Do you realize, Mr.\nChapman,\" continued Markoe, \"what it would mean if we led these things\nback to Mars? They reproduce; multiply where their food supply is\ngreatest. Can't you picture it? From Mars to Earth to Venus. And what\nwould they leave behind?\"\n\n\"You know they're living things, and what their food supply is?\"\ndemanded Chapman.\n\n\"They're not protoplasmic, but what's life? They're alive in the sense\nwe mean. They reproduce. Cargyle and I both have seen them. And as for\ntheir food supply--yes, I can tell you definitely what it is.\n\n\"These things are not matter--they're pure energy. I've seen nothing\nlike it before. They're energy concentrated and undissipating--held\ntogether somehow. And that energy behaves in a life-like manner. It\nfeeds on energy, and it grows.\n\n\"Call them earthworms of space. They break up matter--do something to\nthe big, complex atoms of the heavy elements to break them down. And\nwhen they are done, the light, simple atoms are left--hydrogen, and\nhelium. That's what's happening to the _Denebola_--the earthworms of\nspace feed on the energy in the heavy atoms of her metal hull, and we\nfind traces of hydrogen. The rest of it drifts out into space. And that\nwill go on till there's no metal left. They haven't attacked living\nthings. Maybe they can't. But they'll never leave the _Denebola_ while\na shred of metal remains. Unless they can be destroyed or driven away\nthere's no hope for us.\"\n\n\"You mean--\" began Chapman.\n\n\"I mean, sir, that we dare not call any ship to our assistance while\nthese things exist. I have found no way of destroying them. If we\nlead them back to Mars, and they prove indestructible, we would doom\nthe system. They would be carried to every planet. And the planets\nthemselves are food for them.\"\n\n\"Mightn't other physicists succeed where you fail, Markoe?\" asked\nChapman, with a sneer. \"Maybe you're not as good as you think! We have\nplenty of brilliant men in the labs and universities. They'd probably\nlick these spaceworms in no time.\"\n\n\"There are many men more brilliant than myself,\" replied Markoe,\nignoring the sneer. \"And if they can be destroyed those men would\nfind the way. But it would take time. Time! I am not in error about\nthat, Mr. Chapman. Barring a lucky accident it would take months of\nexperiment. Think of the loss of life that would precede their success!\nAnd it's fully possible that they are indestructible. Lord, man! Will\nyou gamble the fate of our whole civilization just to save your own\nskin? These flames are of disease of metal--maybe a disease of planets.\nBy our oath, we must find the cure--or not return!\"\n\n\"Damned nonsense!\" broke in Simms. \"To hell with that stuff! Why\nhaven't these flames attacked the planets before, if they're all you\nsay? And if they've just come into the system we can't stop them.\nThey're probably on the planets already. What good will our death do?\nI don't have to be a physicist to see that these things can live in\nspace. They don't need heat or air. They can go where they like--\"\n\n\"That's where you're wrong, Mr. Simms,\" interrupted Markoe. \"They can't\ngo where they like. It's true they need no atmosphere. But they do\nneed _food_! They can move through empty space only relatively short\ndistances; the force which holds them together consumes tremendous\nquantities of energy. When the _Denebola_ is gone they will break up,\ndie, if you want to call it that, unless an asteroid or meteor is\nwithin their reach. And they aren't new to the system, in my opinion.\nI suppose they're as old on the asteroids as life is on Earth; older,\nmaybe, but they can't cross the enormous gulf between the asteroid belt\nand the nearest planets, Mars and Jupiter.\"\n\n\"You're space crazy!\" retorted Simms. \"Why, in that length of time\nthey'd have reduced a quarter of matter a thousand times as great as\nall the asteroids--\"\n\n\"You forget the distances between the asteroids themselves. The normal\n'death-rate' of the earthworms of space on the asteroids must be very\nhigh. And their consumption of stone and ore is much slower; I've timed\nthem on samples we collected.\"\n\n\n\nSimms shook his head, as though to clear it. His eyes were blood-shot\nand wild, his face sullen. \"I don't give a damn for all that! That's\njust guessing. Maybe he's right and maybe he ain't. I say he's\nspace-crazy, and drunk on bad air. Earthworms of space! Hell! Talk and\ntalk and talk, while we're all dying! Barfield, get Tracolatown! We're\ncalling a patrol ship out to us. Go on, start your set!\"\n\n\"Barfield, sit still!\" Wallace's quiet voice was like the sharp edge of\na knife. \"Mr. Simms, you are under arrest. Mr. Chapman, I remind you\nthat you are an officer. It should not be necessary. I have seen raw\napprentices who behaved better--\"\n\nChapman made a move toward the captain, belligerently. But Simms was\nbefore him. \"Do you see that?\" he cried, pointing wildly at a port\nbeyond which the cold stars gleamed. \"Do you know what that is, out\nthere? It's death! Death, do you understand, you fool? And it's coming\nin here--it's closing on us, while you stand bleating about--\"\n\n\"He's right, and I'm with Simms,\" shouted Chapman, suddenly. \"Captain\nor no captain, we're calling Tracolatown, and the rest of you interfere\nwith us at your peril!\"\n\nA cold stillness, an awful sense of impending disaster grew in that\nshadowy cabin. Only the captain moved, stepping a pace or two away.\nHis gray eyes under the thick, white brows, were gleaming coldly, and\nhis right hand hung suggestively near the holster at his hip. When he\nspoke his voice rang with scorn. \"Drop your weapons, both of you! You\ndisgrace the service! You are cowards!\"\n\n\"Coward, am I? I'll show you, you old fool!\" With the glint of madness\nburning in his eyes, Simms swung his hand down to his holster, brought\nit up holding a blastor pistol. Chapman's hand moved. The spell holding\nCargyle snapped and he sprang into action. Chapman was nearest him.\nCargyle swung from the hip--smashed his fist into the pilot's jaw. The\nman went over backward; crashed on the floor; lay still. At the same\ninstant two brilliant flashes blazed almost as one in the gloom--two\nthunderous detonations roared and echoed in the narrow cabin. Cargyle's\neyes sought the two principals in the swift drama.\n\nFor an incredibly protracted moment Simms and the captain stood staring\nat each other, each bent slightly forward. Cargyle noticed abstractedly\nthat the force of the explosions of their guns had thrown their hands\nup slightly.\n\nThen Simms slowly straightened, stretched, stood tall as he could,\nmuscles straining. Abruptly he collapsed and fell in a limp and\nlifeless heap upon the floor. Slow blood welled through the back of his\nshirt.\n\n\"For Mr. Simms' death I shall take full responsibility, should I ever\nbe in a position to make a report of the occurrence,\" said Wallace, and\nthrust his blastor pistol back in its holster. \"Parker, Swift--remove\nhis body. And relieve Mr. Chapman of his pistol.\"\n\n\n\nThe slow hours crept by. Men no longer spoke. They sat apart, unmoving,\nin the shadowed cabin. Markoe alone was absent--at work in his\nlaboratory in the stern; hopeless, but fighting to the last. Parker lay\nsleeping peacefully.\n\nThe air was still, and faintly musty. Beyond the ports the stars\nblazed. The ship was rolling slightly, and at long intervals the sun,\nsmall with distance, rose sluggishly in the starboard ports, shot\nshafts of brighter light into the cabin.\n\nIn the silence a clock's tick was loud, portentous--a funeral drum\nattending the passing seconds. With a curse, one of the men got up and\nstopped its ticking.\n\nCargyle was lost in a deep reverie, remembering Earth, his home, his\nparents, green fields bright with spring foliage, the great cities\nhe had known, the mountains, seas. In his imagination he heard the\nmusic of Earth, and saw the sunrise. It was very far away now, and\nlost forever. But he had known the price the spaceman paid. He had no\nregrets.\n\nInto his line of vision crept a pale blur of light and his eyes focused\non it. It was a flame-thing--one of the earthworms of space. They had\nat last invaded the pilot cabin. Idly he watched it. It was no more\nthan a foot in length--an \"infant.\" It made a feeble glow against the\nwall as it came slowly toward them, its tip moving like the tongue of a\nsnake.\n\nParker awoke, and made a small disturbance as he groaned, yawned, and\ngot up and helped himself to water and food. When he gathered his tools\nand started for the recalcitrant rocket timer one of the anonymous\nshapes in the shadow growled: \"For Lord's sake!\"\n\n\"Go to hell,\" said Parker, and crouched down over the timer.\n\nCargyle grinned. With so little time left--and to spend it on a broken\npiece of machinery! But after all, maybe Parker's way was the sanest.\nHe was moving the manual control, and the timer crackled, and spat fat,\nblue sparks.\n\nThe flame-thing suddenly recoiled, drew back as though stung.\nCautiously it advanced again; again sprang back. It rose upright, stood\nweaving and swaying.\n\n\"You fool! Don't you know we're--\"\n\n\"Sure I know!\" Parker shut off the timer to turn and answer. \"We're\ngoing out! To hell with it! Sit there and cry about it, if you want!\nBut before I go I'll know what's wrong with this damned thing!\"\n\nThe \"infant\" flame was advancing again.\n\nParker switched on the timer, and began his rhythmic movement of\nthe control. The instant the timer began its hissing little beat,\nthe \"spaceworm\" stopped, sprang erect, began twisting, winding. It\nhad approached quite close. A tiny sound came from it--a thin, high\nsquealing--the first sound Cargyle had ever heard them make.\n\nSomething strange was happening to the spaceworm. It had lost its\nunity; its upper end was splitting up into fine threads of twisting\ncolor that spread out, separated.\n\nThe squealing ceased; there was a final faint _pop!_ a brighter flash\nof color, then the thing was gone!\n\nCargyle at first watched curiously, then with a growing intentness.\nWhen the spaceworm vanished he sat staring. Slowly his eyes swung\naround to the timer, mumbling feebly as Parker moved its control. It\nspat its brisk, blue sparks.\n\nAnd suddenly Cargyle got it! The timer ... Parker working on it hour\nafter hour ... and no spaceworms in the control cabin--no spaceworms in\nthe cabin till Parker slept, and the timer was still!\n\n\"Barfield!\" he yelled, in a voice that brought the men to their feet.\n\"Send our position! We've won! We're going in!\"\n\nLord, was there time? He grabbed up a space-helmet, switched on its\ntiny set, and shouted into the speaker: \"Come back, Markoe! I've found\nit--the wave-length! Come back!\"\n\n\n\nIt was simple, the way Markoe explained it later. The lucky accident,\nthe chance in a million, had happened. The field which the broken timer\nbuilt up when operated neutralized whatever force held the flame-things\ntogether. The spaceworms could only retreat before that field; if they\nwere caught in it their cohesion vanished, and their energy fled--they\n\"died.\"\n\nIt was only necessary, Markoe said, to analyze and then amplify that\nfield; send it pulsing out into space. Most of the spaceworms would be\ncaught in it instantly, gathered, as they were, upon the _Denebola_.\nIf any were further out in space they would be driven back before the\nfield, or overtaken and destroyed.\n\nThe heavy hopelessness that had filled the control cabin vanished.\nLights went on. Barfield snapped on his set.\n\n\"The _Denebola_ ... calling Tracolatown. Calling 3TRA45 ... this is the\n_Denebola_....\" Strongly, urgently, the call went out.\n\n\"Can we last?\" Cargyle asked.\n\n\"If we contact them quickly,\" replied Wallace. \"At the worst, we\ncan hold out a while in space-suits. But we've got to pick up the\nTracolatown station soon.\"\n\nMarkoe and Parker set to work on the timer; Captain Wallace and Cargyle\nchecked and rechecked their position; everyone seemed to find something\nto do. But all activity stopped, men stood motionless to listen, as\nthey heard it--faint at first, but swiftly stronger, clearer, even to\nthe tinge of anxiety in the voice.\n\n\"... where are you, _Denebola_? Report your position at once. We have\nbeen calling you. What is your position, _Denebola_? Patrol rocket\nready to take off. Tracolatown calling the _Denebola_....\"\n\nThe musty air seemed fresher as that voice echoed in the small control\nroom.\n\n\n\n\n",
