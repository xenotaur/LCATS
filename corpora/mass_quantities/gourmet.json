    "body": "Unable to get out to the ballgame and a long way off from the girls,\nmen on ships think about, talk about, bitch about their food. It's\ntrue that Woman remains a topic of thoughtful study, but discussion\ncan never replace practice in an art. Food, on the other hand, is a\nchallenge shipmen face three times a day, so central to their thoughts\nthat a history of sea-faring can be read from a commissary list.\n\nIn the days when salt-sea sailors were charting islands and spearing\nseals, for example, the fo'c's'le hands called themselves Lobscousers,\ncelebrating the liquid hash then prominent in the marine menu. The\nLimey sailor got the name of the anti-scorbutic citrus squeezed into\nhis diet, a fruit known to us mariners of a more sophisticated age\nonly as garnish for our groundside gin-and-tonic. And today we Marsmen\nare called Slimeheads, honoring in our title the _Chlorella_ and\n_Scenedesmus_ algae that, by filling up the spaces within, open the\nroad to the larger Space without.\n\nShould any groundsman dispute the importance of belly-furniture in\nhistory--whether it be exterminating whales, or introducing syphilis\nto the Fiji Islanders, or settling the Australian littoral with\ncross-coves from Middlesex and Hampshire--he is referred to the\nhundred-and-first chapter of _Moby Dick_, a book spooled in the\namusement tanks of all but the smallest spacers. I trust, however, that\nno Marsman will undertake to review this inventory of refreshment more\nthan a week from groundfall. A catalogue of sides of beef and heads of\nLeyden cheese and ankers of good Geneva would prove heavy reading for a\nman condemned to snack on the Chlorella-spawn of cis-Martian space.\n\nThe _Pequod's_ crew ate wormy biscuit and salt beef. Nimitz's men won\ntheir war on canned pork and beans. The _Triton_ made her underwater\nperiplus of Earth with a galley stocked with frozen pizza and\nconcentrated apple-juice. But then, when sailors left the seas for the\nskies, a decline set in.\n\nThe first amenity of groundside existence to be abandoned was decent\nfood. The earliest men into the vacuum swallowed protein squeezings\nfrom aluminum tubes, and were glad enough to drop back to the\ngroundsman's diet of steak and fried potatoes.\n\n\n\nLong before I was a boy in Med School, itching to look at black sky\nthrough a view-port, galley science had fulfilled the disgusting\nexordium of _Isaiah_ 36:12, to feed the Slimeheads for breakfast today\nwhat was day-before-yesterday's table-scraps and jakes-water.\n\nThe Ship's Cook, the man who accomplishes the daily miracle of turning\noffal into eatables, is in many ways the most vital man aboard a\nspacer. He can make morale or foment a mutiny. His power is paramount.\nSlimeheads remember the H. M. S. _Ajax_ fiasco, for example, in which a\ngalleyman leveled his Chlorella tanks with heavy water from the ship's\nshielding. Four officers and twenty-one Other Ranks were rescued from\nthe _Ajax_ in deep space, half dead from deuterium poisoning. We think\nof the _Benjo Maru_ incident, too, caused by a Ship's Cook who allowed\nhis algaeal staff-of-life to become contaminated with a fast-growing\n_Saccharomycodes_ yeast. The Japanese vessel staggered to her pad at\nPiano West after a twenty-week drunk: the alien yeast had got into\nthe stomach of every man aboard, where it fermented each subsequent\nbite he ate to a superior grade of _sake_. And for a third footnote to\nthe ancient observation, \"God sends food, and the Devil sends cooks,\"\nMarsmen will recall what happened aboard my ship the _Charles Partlow\nSale_.\n\nThe _Sale_ blasted off from Brady Station in the middle of August, due\nin at Piano West in early May. In no special hurry, we were taking\nthe low-energy route to Mars, a pathway about as long in time as the\nhuman period of gestation. Our cargo consisted mostly of Tien-Shen fir\nseedlings and some tons of an arctic grass-seed--these to be planted\nin the _maria_ to squeeze out the native blue bugberry vines. We had\naboard the Registry minimum of six men and three officers. Ship's\nSurgeon was myself, Paul Vilanova. Our Captain was Willy Winkelmann,\nthe hardest man in space and very likely the fattest. Ship's Cook was\nRobert Bailey.\n\nCooking aboard a spacer is a job combining the more frustrating\ntensions of biochemistry, applied mycology, high-speed farming,\ndietetics and sewage engineering. It's the Cook's responsibility to\nsee that each man aboard gets each day no less than five pounds of\nwater, two pounds of oxygen, and one-and-a-half pounds of dry food.\nThis isn't just a paragraph from the Spacer Union Contract. It's a\nstatement of the least fuel a man can run on.\n\nTwelve tons of water, oxygen, and food would have filled the cargo\ncompartments to bursting, and left a small ship like the _C. P. Sale_\nno reason to reach for Mars. By allowing a colony of Chlorella algae to\nwork over our used air, water and other effluvia, though, three tons\nof metabolites would see us through from Brady Station to Piano West\nand back. Recycling was the answer. The molecule of carbohydrate, fat,\nprotein or mineral that didn't feed the crew fed the algae. And the\nalgae fed us.\n\nAll waste was used to fertilize our liquid fields. Even the stubble\nfrom our 2,680 shaves and the clippings from our 666 haircuts en route\nand back would be fed into the Chlorella tanks. Human hair is rich in\nessential amino acids.\n\nThe algae--dried by the Cook, bleached with methyl alcohol to kill the\nsmell and make the residue more digestible, disguised and seasoned in a\nhundred ways--served as a sort of meat-and-potatoes that never quite\nwore out. Our air and water were equally immortal. Each molecule of\noxygen would be conversant with the alveoli of every man aboard by the\nend of our trip. Every drop of water would have been intimate with the\nglomeruli of each kidney on the ship before we grounded in. Groundling\npoliticians are right enough when they say that we spacers are a\nbreed apart. We're the one race of men who can't afford the luxury of\nsqueamishness.\n\n\n\nThough I'm signed aboard as Ship's Surgeon, I seldom lift a knife\nin space. My employment is more in the nature of TS-card-puncher\nextraordinary. My duties are to serve as wailing-wall, morale officer,\nguardian of the medicinal whiskey and frustrator of mutual murder.\nGenerally the man aboard who'd serve as the most popular murder-victim\nis the Cook. This trip, the-man-you-love-to-hate was our Captain.\n\nIf the Cook hadn't problems enough with the chemical and psychic duties\nof his office, Winkelmann supplied the want. Captain Willy Winkelmann\nwas the sort of man who, if he had to go into space at all, had best do\nso alone. If the Prussians had a Marine Corps, Winkelmann would have\ndone splendidly as Drill Instructor for their boot camp. His heart\nwas a chip of helium ice, his voice dripped sarcastic acid. The planet\nEarth was hardly large enough to accommodate a wart as annoying as\nWilly Winkelmann. Cheek-by-jowl every day in a nacelle the size of a\nPullman car, our Captain quickly established himself as a major social\nhemorrhoid.\n\nThe Captain's particular patsy was, of course, young Bailey the Cook.\nIt was Winkelmann who saw humorous possibilities in the entry, \"Bailey,\nRobert,\" on Ship's Articles. He at once renamed our unfortunate\nshipmate \"Belly-Robber.\" It was Winkelmann who discussed _haut\ncuisine_ and the properties of the nobler wines while we munched our\nalgaeburgers and sipped coffee that tasted of utility water. And it was\nCaptain Willy Winkelmann who never referred to the ship's head by any\nother name than The Kitchen Cabinet.\n\nBailey tried to feed us by groundside standards. He hid the taste\nof synthetic methionine--an essential amino acid not synthesized by\nChlorella--by seasoning our algaeal repasts with pinches of oregano\nand thyme. He tinted the pale-green dollops of pressed Chlorella pink,\ntextured the mass to the consistency of hamburger and toasted the\nslabs to a delicate brown in a forlorn attempt to make mock-meat.\nFor dessert, he served a fudge compounded from the dextrose-paste of\nthe carbohydrate recycler. The crew thanked him. The Captain did not.\n\"Belly-Robber,\" he said, his tone icy as winter wind off the North Sea,\n\"you had best cycle this mess through the tanks again. There is a pun\nin my home country: _Mensch ist was er isst._ It means, you are what\nyou eat. I think you are impertinent to suggest I should become this\n_Schweinerei_ you are feeding me.\" Captain Winkelmann blotted his chin\nwith his napkin, heaved his bulk up from the table, and climbed up the\nladder from the dining-cubby.\n\n\n\n\"Doc, do you like Winkelmann?\" the Cook asked me.\n\n\"Not much,\" I said. \"I suspect that the finest gift our Captain can\ngive his mother is to be absent from her on Mother's Day. But we've got\nto live with him. He's a good man at driving a ship.\"\n\n\"I wish he'd leave off driving this Cook,\" Bailey said. \"The fat swine!\"\n\n\"His plumpness is an unwitting tribute to your cooking, Bailey,\" I\nsaid. \"He eats well. We all do. I've dined aboard a lot of spacers in\nmy time, and I'll testify that you set a table second to none.\"\n\nBailey took a handful of dried Chlorella from a bin and fingered it. It\nwas green, smelled of swamp, and looked appetizing as a bedsore. \"This\nis what I have to work with,\" he said. He tossed the stuff back into\nits bin. \"In Ohio, which is my home country, in the presence of ladies,\nwe'd call such garbage Horse-Leavings.\"\n\n\"You'll never make Winkelmann happy,\" I said. \"Even the simultaneous\ndeath of all other human beings could hardly make him smile. Keep up\nthe good work, though, and you'll keep our Captain fat.\"\n\nBailey nodded from his one-man cloud of gloom. I got a bottle of rye\nfrom Medical Stores and offered him a therapeutic draught. The Cook\nwaved my gift aside. \"Not now, Doc,\" he said. \"I'm thinking about\ntomorrow's menu.\"\n\nThe product of Bailey's cerebrations was on the mess table at noon the\nnext day. We were each served an individual head of lettuce, dressed\nwith something very like vinegar and oil, spiced with tiny leaves of\nburnet. How Bailey had constructed those synthetic lettuces I can only\nguess: the hours spent preparing a green Chlorella paste, rolling and\ndrying and shaping each artificial leaf, the fitting together of nine\nheads like crisp, three-dimensional jigsaw puzzles. The _pi\u00e8ce de\nr\u00e9sistance_ was again a \"hamburger steak;\" but this time the algaeal\nmass that made it up was buried in a rich, meaty gravy that was only\nfaintly green. The essence-of-steak used in these Chlorella cutlets had\nbeen sprinkled with a lavish hand. Garlic was richly in evidence. \"It's\nso tender,\" the radioman joked, \"that I can hardly believe it's really\nsteak.\"\n\nBailey stared across the dining-cubby toward Winkelmann, silently\nimploring the Captain's ratification of his masterpiece. The big\nman's pink cheeks bulged and jumped with his chewing. He swallowed.\n\"Belly-Robber,\" Winkelmann said, \"I had almost rather you served me\nthis pond-scum raw than have it all mucked-up with synthetic onions and\ncycler-salt.\"\n\n\n\n\"You seem able enough to choke down Bailey's chow, Captain,\" I said. I\ngazed at Winkelmann's form, bulbous from a lifetime of surfeit feeding.\n\n\"Yes, I eat it,\" the Captain said, taking and talking through another\nbite. \"But I eat only as a man in the desert will eat worms and\ngrasshoppers, to stay alive.\"\n\n\"Sir, what in heaven's name do you expect from me?\" Bailey pleaded.\n\n\"Only good food,\" Winkelmann mumbled through his mouthful of disguised\nalgae. He tapped his head with a finger. \"This--the brain that guides\nthe ship--cannot be coaxed to work on hog-slop. You understand me,\nBelly-Robber?\"\n\nBailey, his hands fisted at his sides, nodded. \"Yes, sir. But I really\ndon't know what I can do to please you.\"\n\n\"You are a spacer and a Ship's Cook, not a suburban _Hausfrau_ with the\nvapors,\" Winkelmann said. \"I do not expect from you hysterics, tantrums\nor weeping. Only--can you understand this, so simple?--food that will\nkeep my belly content and my brain alive.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Bailey said, his face a picture of that offense the British\nterm Dumb Insolence.\n\nWinkelmann got up and climbed the ladder to the pilot-cubicle. I\nfollowed him. \"Captain,\" I said, \"you're driving Bailey too hard.\nYou're asking him to make bricks without straw.\"\n\nWinkelmann regarded me with his pale-blue stare. \"You think, Doctor,\nthat my cruelty to the Belly-Robber is the biliousness of a middle-aged\nman?\"\n\n\"Frankly, I can't understand your attitude at all,\" I said.\n\n\"You accuse me of driving a man to make bricks without straw,\"\nWinkelmann said. \"Very well, Doctor. It is my belief that if the\nPharaoh's taskmaster had had my firmness of purpose, the Children of\nIsrael would have made bricks with stubble. Necessity, Doctor, is the\nmother of invention. I am Bailey's necessity. My unkindnesses make him\nuncomfortable, I doubt that not. But I am forcing him to experiment,\nto improvise, to widen the horizons of his ingenuity. He will learn\nsomehow to bring good food from Chlorella tanks.\"\n\n\"You're driving him too hard, Sir,\" I said. \"He'll crack.\"\n\n\"Bailey will have some fifty thousand dollars' salary waiting when we\nground at Brady Station,\" Captain Winkelmann said. \"So much money buys\nmany discomforts. That will be all, Doctor Vilanova.\"\n\n\"Crew morale on the ship....\" I began.\n\n\"That will be all, Doctor Vilanova,\" Captain Winkelmann repeated.\n\n\n\nBailey grew more silent as we threaded our way along the elliptical\npath to Mars. Each meal he prepared was a fresh attempt to propitiate\nthe appetite of our splenetic Captain. Each such offering was condemned\nby that heartless man. Bailey began to try avoiding the Captain at\nmealtimes, but was frustrated by Winkelmann's orders. \"Convey my\ncompliments to the Chef, please,\" the Captain would instruct one of\nthe crew, \"and ask him to step down here a moment.\" And the Cook would\ncheerlessly appear in the dining-cubby, to have his culinary genius\nacidly called in question again.\n\nI myself do not doubt that Bailey was the finest Cook ever to go\ninto Hohmann orbit. His every meal established a higher benchmark in\nbrilliant galleymanship. We were served, for instance, an _ersatz_ hot\nturkey supreme. The cheese-sauce was almost believable, the Chlorella\nturkey-flesh was white and tender. Bailey served with this delicacy\na grainy and delicious \"cornbread,\" and had extracted from his algae\na lipid butter-substitute that soaked into the hot \"bread\" with a\ngenuinely dairy smell. \"Splendid, Bailey,\" I said.\n\n\"We are not amused,\" said Captain Winkelmann, accepting a second\nhelping of the pseudo-turkey. \"You are improving, Belly-Robber, but\nonly arithmetically. Your first efforts were so hideous as to require\na geometric progression of improving excellence to raise them to mere\nedibility. By the time we are halfway 'round the Sun, I trust you will\nhave learned to cook with the competence of a freshman Home Economics\nstudent. That will be all, Bailey.\"\n\nThe crew and my fellow-officers were amused by Winkelmann's riding of\nBailey; they were in addition gratified that the battle between their\nCaptain and their Cook served to feed them so well. Most spacers embark\non an outward voyage somewhat plump, having eaten enough on their last\nfew days aground to smuggle several hundred calories of fat and many\nmemories of good food aboard with them. This trip, none of the men had\nlost weight during the first four months in space. Winkelmann, indeed,\nseemed to have gained. His uniform was taut over his plump backside,\nand he puffed a bit up the ladders. I was considering suggesting to our\nCaptain that he curtail his diet for reasons of health, a bit of advice\nthat would have stood unique in the annals of space medicine, when\nWinkelmann produced his supreme insult to our Cook.\n\n\n\nEach man aboard a spacer is allowed ten kilograms of personal effects\nbesides his uniforms, these being considered Ship's Furnishing. As\nhis rank and responsibility merit, the Captain is allowed double this\nration. He may thus bring aboard with him some forty-five pounds of\nbooks, playing-cards, knitting-wool, whiskey or what have you to help\nhim while away the hours between the planets. Bailey, I knew for a\nfact, had used up his weight-allowance in bringing aboard a case of\nspices: marjoram and mint, costmary, file powder, basil and allspice,\nand a dozen others.\n\nCaptain Winkelmann was not a reader, and had brought no books. Cards\ninterested him not at all, as card-playing implies a sociability alien\nto his nature. He never drank aboard ship. I had supposed that he'd\nexercised his option of returning his personal-effects weight allowance\nto the owners for the consideration of one hundred dollars a kilogram.\nTo collect the maximum allowance, spacers have been known to come\naboard their ship mother-naked.\n\nBut this was not the case with Winkelmann. His personal-effects\nbaggage, an unlabeled cardboard box, appeared under the table at noon\nmess some hundred days out from Piano West. Winkelmann rested his feet\non the mysterious box as he sat to eat.\n\n\"What disgusting form does the ship's garbage appear in today,\nBelly-Robber?\" he asked the Cook.\n\nBailey frowned, but kept his temper, an asceticism in which by now he'd\nhad much practice. \"I've been working on the problem of steak, Sir,\"\nhe said. \"I think I've whipped the taste; what was left was to get the\ntexture steak-like. Do you understand, Sir?\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Winkelmann growled. \"You intend that your latest mess\nshould feel like steak to the mouth, and not like baby-food. Right?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir,\" Bailey said. \"Well, I squeezed the\nsteak-substrate--Chlorella, of course, with all sorts of special\nseasonings--through a sieve, and blanched the strands in hot algaeal\noil. Then I chopped those strands to bits and rolled them out. _Voila!_\nI had something very close in texture to the muscle-fibers of genuine\nmeat.\"\n\n\"Remarkable, Bailey,\" I said.\n\n\"It rather throws me off my appetite to hear how you muddle about with\nour food,\" the Captain said, his jowls settling into an expression of\ndistaste. \"It's quite all right to eat lobster, for example, but I\nnever cared to see the ugly beast boiled before my eyes. Detail spoils\nthe meal.\"\n\nBailey lifted the cover off the electric warming-pan at the center of\nthe table and tenderly lifted a small \"steak\" onto each of our plates.\n\"Try it,\" he urged the Captain.\n\n\n\nCaptain Winkelmann sliced off a corner of his algaeal steak. The\ncolor was an excellent medium-rare, the odor was the rich smell\nof fresh-broiled beef. Winkelmann bit down, chewed, swallowed. \"Not\ntoo bad, Belly-Robber,\" he said, nodding. Bailey grinned and bobbed\nhis head, his hands folded before him in an ecstasy of pleasure. A\nkind word from the Captain bettered the ruffles-and-flourishes of a\nmore reasonable man. \"But it still needs something ... something,\"\nWinkelmann went on, slicing off another portion of the tasty Chlorella.\n\"Aha! I have it!\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir?\" Bailey asked.\n\n\"This, Belly-Robber!\" Winkelmann reached beneath the mess-table and\nripped open his cardboard carton. He brought out a bottle and unscrewed\nthe cap. \"Ketchup,\" he said, splattering the red juice over Bailey's\nmasterpiece. \"The scarlet burial-shroud for the failures of Cooks.\"\nLifting a hunk of the \"steak,\" streaming ketchup, to his mouth,\nWinkelmann chewed. \"Just the thing,\" he smiled.\n\n\"Damn you!\" Bailey shouted.\n\nWinkelmann's smile flicked off, and his blue eyes pierced the Cook.\n\n\"... Sir,\" Bailey added.\n\n\"That's better,\" Winkelmann said, and took another bite. He said\nmeditatively, \"Used with caution, and only by myself, I believe I have\nsufficient ketchup here to see me through to Mars. Please keep a\nbottle on the table for all my future meals, Belly-Robber.\"\n\n\"But, Sir....\" Bailey began.\n\n\"You must realize, Belly-Robber, that a dyspeptic Captain is a threat\nto the welfare of his ship. Were I to continue eating your surrealistic\nslops for another hundred days, without the small consolation of\nthis sauce I had the foresight to bring with me, I'd likely be in\nno condition to jet us safely down to the Piano West pad. Do you\nunderstand, Belly-Robber?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I understand that you're an ungrateful, impossible, square-headed,\nslave-driving....\"\n\n\"Watch your noun,\" Winkelmann cautioned the Cook. \"Your adjectives are\ninsubordinate; your noun might prove mutinous.\"\n\n\"Captain, you've gone too far,\" I said. Bailey, his fists knotted, was\nscarlet, his chest heaving with emotion.\n\n\"Doctor, I must point out to you that it ill behooves the Ship's\nSurgeon to side with the Cook against the Captain,\" Winkelmann said.\n\n\"Sir, Bailey has tried hard to please you,\" I said. \"The other officers\nand the men have been more than satisfied with his work.\"\n\n\"That only suggests atrophy of their taste buds,\" Winkelmann said.\n\"Doctor, you are excused. As are you, Belly-Robber,\" he added.\n\n\n\nBailey and I climbed from the mess compartment together. I steered him\nto my quarters, where the medical supplies were stored. He sat on my\nbunk and exploded into weeping, banging his fists against the metal\nbulkhead. \"You'll have that drink now,\" I said.\n\n\"No, dammit!\" he shouted.\n\n\"Orders,\" I said. I poured us each some fifty cc's of rye. \"This is\ntherapy, Bailey,\" I told him. He poured the fiery stuff down his throat\nlike water and silently held out his glass for a second. I provided it.\n\nAfter a few minutes Bailey's sobbing ceased. \"Sorry, Doc,\" he said.\n\n\"You've taken more pressure than most men would,\" I said. \"Nothing to\nbe ashamed of.\"\n\n\"He's crazy. What sane man would expect me to dip Wiener schnitzel\nand sauerkraut and _Backhahndl nach suddeutscher Art_ out of an algae\ntank? I've got nothing but microscopic weeds to cook for him! Worn-out\nmolecules reclaimed from the head; packaged amino acid additives. And\nhe expects meals that would take the blue ribbon at the annual banquet\nof the Friends of Escoffier!\"\n\n\"Yours is an ancient plaint, Bailey,\" I said. \"You've worked your\nfingers to the bone, slaving over a hot stove, and you're not\nappreciated. But you're not married to Winkelmann, remember. A year\nfrom now you'll be home in Ohio, fifty grand richer, set to start that\nrestaurant of yours and forget about our fat Flying Dutchman.\"\n\n\"I hate him,\" Bailey said with the simplicity of true emotion. He\nreached for the bottle. I let him have it. Sometimes alcohol can be\nan apt confederate of _vis medicatrix naturae_, the healing power of\nnature. Half an hour later I strapped Bailey into his bunk to sleep it\noff. That therapeutic drunk seemed to be just what he'd needed.\n\nFor morning mess the next day we had a broth remarkable in\nhorribleness, a pottage or boiled _Chlorella vulgaris_ that looked\nand tasted like the vomit of some bottom-feeding sea-beast. Bailey,\nred-eyed and a-tremble, made no apology, and stared at Winkelmann as\nthough daring him to comment. The Captain lifted a spoonful of the\ndisgusting stuff to his lips, smacked and said, \"Belly-Robber, you're\nimproving a little at last.\"\n\nBailey nodded and smiled. \"Thank you, Sir,\" he said.\n\nI smiled, too. Bailey had conquered himself. His psychic defenses were\nnow strong enough to withstand the Captain's fiercest assaults of\nirony. Our food would likely be bad the rest of this trip, but that was\na price I was willing to pay for seeing destroyed the Willy Winkelmann\ntheory of forcing a Cook to make bricks without straw. The Captain\nhad pushed too hard. He'd need that ketchup for the meals to come, I\nthought.\n\nNoon mess was nearly as awful as breakfast had been. The coffee tasted\nof salt, and went largely undrunk. The men in the mess compartment were\nvehement in their protests, blaming the Captain, in his absence, for\nthe decline in culinary standards. Bailey seemed not to care. He served\nthe algaeburgers with half a mind, and hurried back into his galley\noblivious of the taunts of his crewmates.\n\n\n\nThere being only three seats in the _Sale's_ mess compartment, we ate\nour meals in three shifts. That evening, going down the ladder to\nsupper, my nose was met with a spine-tingling barbecue tang, a smell\nto make a man think of gray charcoal glowing in a picnic brazier,\nof cicadas chirping and green grass underfoot, of the pop and hiss\nof canned beer being church-keyed. \"He's done it, Doc!\" one of the\nfirst-shift diners said. \"It actually tastes of food!\"\n\n\"Then he's beat the Captain at his game,\" I said.\n\n\"The Dutchman won't want to mess ketchup on these steaks,\" the crewman\nsaid.\n\nI sat, unfolded my napkin, and looked with hope to the electric\nwarming-pan at the center of the table. Bailey served the three of\nus with the small \"steaks.\" Each contained about a pound of dried\nChlorella, I judged, teasing mine with my fork. But they were drenched\nin a gravy rich as the stuff grandma used to make in her black iron\nskillet, peppery and seasoned with courageous bits of garlic. I cut\na bit from my steak and chewed it. Too tender, of course; there are\nlimits to art. But the pond-scum taste was gone. Bailey appeared in the\ngalley door. I gestured for him to join me. \"You've done it, Bailey,\"\nI said. \"Every Slimehead in orbit will thank you for this. This is\nactually _good_.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Doc,\" Bailey said.\n\nI smiled and took another bite. \"You may not realize it, Bailey; but\nthis is a victory for the Captain, too. He drove you to this triumph;\nyou couldn't have done it without him.\"\n\n\"You mean he was just whipping me on, trying to make me do better?\"\nBailey asked.\n\n\"He was driving you to do the impossible,\" I said; \"and you did it. Our\nCaptain may be a hard man, Bailey; but he did know how to coax maximum\nperformance out of his Ship's Cook.\"\n\nBailey stood up. \"Do you like Captain Winkelmann, Doctor?\" he asked.\n\nI thought about his question a moment. Winkelmann was good at his job.\nHe persuaded his men by foul means, true; but it was all for the good\nof the ship and his crew. \"Do I like Captain Winkelmann?\" I asked,\nspearing another piece of my artificial steak. \"Bailey, I'm afraid I'll\nhave to admit that I do.\"\n\nBailey smiled and lifted a second steak from the warming-pan onto my\nplate. \"Then have another piece,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n",
