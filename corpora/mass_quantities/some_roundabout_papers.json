    "body": "ON SOME CARP AT SANS SOUCI\n\n\nWE have lately made the acquaintance of an old lady of ninety, who has\npassed the last twenty-five years of her old life in a great metropolitan\nestablishment, the workhouse, namely, of the parish of Saint Lazarus.\nStay\u2014twenty-three or four years ago, she came out once, and thought to\nearn a little money by hop-picking; but being overworked, and having to\nlie out at night, she got a palsy which has incapacitated her from all\nfurther labour, and has caused her poor old limbs to shake ever since.\n\nAn illustration of that dismal proverb which tells us how poverty makes\nus acquainted with strange bed-fellows, this poor old shaking body has to\nlay herself down every night in her workhouse bed by the side of some\nother old woman with whom she may or may not agree.  She herself can\u2019t be\na very pleasant bed-fellow, poor thing! with her shaking old limbs and\ncold feet.  She lies awake a deal of the night, to be sure, not thinking\nof happy old times, for hers never were happy; but sleepless with aches,\nand agues, and rheumatism of old age.  \u201cThe gentleman gave me\nbrandy-and-water,\u201d she said, her old voice shaking with rapture at the\nthought.  I never had a great love for Queen Charlotte, but I like her\nbetter now from what this old lady told me.  The Queen, who loved snuff\nherself, has left a legacy of snuff to certain poorhouses; and, in her\nwatchful nights, this old woman takes a pinch of Queen Charlotte\u2019s snuff,\n\u201cand it do comfort me, sir, that it do!\u201d  _Pulveris exigui munus_.  Here\nis a forlorn aged creature, shaking with palsy, with no soul among the\ngreat struggling multitude of mankind to care for her, not quite trampled\nout of life, but past and forgotten in the rush, made a little happy, and\nsoothed in her hours of unrest by this penny legacy.  Let me think as I\nwrite.  (The next month\u2019s sermon, thank goodness! is safe to press.)\nThis discourse will appear at the season when I have read that\nwassail-bowls make their appearance; at the season of pantomime, turkey\nand sausages, plum-puddings, jollifications for schoolboys; Christmas\nbills, and reminiscences more or less sad and sweet for elders.  If we\noldsters are not merry, we shall be having a semblance of merriment.  We\nshall see the young folks laughing round the holly-bush.  We shall pass\nthe bottle round cosily as we sit by the fire.  That old thing will have\na sort of festival too.  Beef, beer, and pudding will be served to her\nfor that day also.  Christmas falls on a Thursday.  Friday is the\nworkhouse day for coming out.  Mary, remember that old Goody Twoshoes has\nher invitation for Friday, 26th December!  Ninety is she, poor old soul?\nAh! what a bonny face to catch under a mistletoe!  \u201cYes, ninety, sir,\u201d\nshe says, \u201cand my mother was a hundred, and my grandmother was a hundred\nand two.\u201d\n\nHerself ninety, her mother a hundred, her grandmother a hundred and two?\nWhat a queer calculation!\n\nNinety!  Very good, granny: you were born, then, in 1772.\n\nYour mother, we will say, was twenty-seven when you were born, and was\nborn therefore in 1745.\n\nYour grandmother was thirty-five when her daughter was born, and was born\ntherefore in 1710.\n\nWe will begin with the present granny first.  My good old creature, you\ncan\u2019t of course remember, but that little gentleman for whom you mother\nwas laundress in the Temple was the ingenious Mr Goldsmith, author of a\n\u201cHistory of England,\u201d the \u201cVicar of Wakefield,\u201d and many diverting\npieces.  You were brought almost an infant to his chambers in Brick\nCourt, and he gave you some sugar-candy, for the doctor was always good\nto children.  That gentleman who well-nigh smothered you by sitting down\non you as you lay in a chair asleep was the learned Mr S. Johnson, whose\nhistory of \u201cRasselas\u201d you have never read, my pour soul; and whose\ntragedy of \u201cIrene\u201d I don\u2019t believe any man in these kingdoms ever\nperused.  That tipsy Scotch gentleman who used to come to the chambers\nsometimes, and at whom everybody laughed, wrote a more amusing book than\nany of the scholars, your Mr Burke and your Mr Johnson, and your Dr\nGoldsmith.  Your father often took him home in a chair to his lodgings;\nand has done as much for Parson Sterne in Bond Street, the famous wit.\nOf course, my good creature, you remember the Gordon Riots, and crying No\nPopery before Mr Langdale\u2019s house, the Popish distiller\u2019s, and that bonny\nfire of my Lord Mansfield\u2019s books in Bloomsbury Square?  Bless us, what a\nheap of illuminations you have seen! For the glorious victory over the\nAmericans at Breed\u2019s Hill; for the peace in 1814, and the beautiful\nChinese bridge in St James\u2019s Park; for the coronation of his Majesty,\nwhom you recollect as Prince of Wales, Goody, don\u2019t you?  Yes; and you\nwent in a procession of laundresses to pay your respects to his good\nlady, the injured Queen of England, at Brandenburg House; and you\nremember your mother told you how she was taken to see the Scotch lords\nexecuted at the Tower.  And as for your grandmother, she was born five\nmonths after the battle of Malplaquet, she was; where her poor father was\nkilled, fighting like a bold Briton for the Queen.  With the help of a\n\u201cWade\u2019s Chronology,\u201d I can make out ever so queer a history for you, my\npoor old body, and a pedigree as authentic as many in the peerage-books.\n\nPeerage-books and pedigrees?  What does she know about them? Battles and\nvictories, treasons, kings, and beheadings, literary gentlemen, and the\nlike, what have they ever been to her? Granny, did you ever hear of\nGeneral Wolfe?  Your mother may have seen him embark, and your father may\nhave carried a musket under him.  Your grandmother may have cried huzza\nfor Marlborough; but what is the Prince Duke to you, and did you ever so\nmuch as hear tell of his name?  How many hundred or thousand of years had\nthat toad lived who was in the coal at the defunct exhibition?\u2014and yet he\nwas not a bit better informed than toads seven or eight hundred years\nyounger.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me your nonsense about Exhibitions, and Prince Dukes, and\ntoads in coals, or coals in toads, or what is it?\u201d says granny.  \u201cI know\nthere was a good Queen Charlotte, for she left me snuff; and it comforts\nme of a night when I lie awake.\u201d\n\nTo me there is something very touching in the notion of that little pinch\nof comfort doled out to granny, and gratefully inhaled by her in the\ndarkness.  Don\u2019t you remember what traditions there used to be of chests\nof plate, bulses of diamonds, laces of inestimable value, sent out of the\ncountry privately by the old Queen, to enrich certain relatives in\nM-ckl-nb-rg Str-l-tz?  Not all the treasure went.  _Non omnis moritur_.\nA poor old palsied thing at midnight is made happy sometimes as she lifts\nher shaking old hand to her nose.  Gliding noiselessly among the beds\nwhere lie the poor creatures huddled in their cheerless dormitory, I\nfancy an old ghost with a snuff-box that does not creak.  \u201cThere, Goody,\ntake of my rappee.  You will not sneeze, and I shall not say \u2018God bless\nyou.\u2019  But you will think kindly of old Queen Charlotte, won\u2019t you?  Ah!\nI had a many troubles, a many troubles.  I was a prisoner almost so much\nas you are.  I had to eat boiled mutton every day: _entre nous_, I\nabominated it.  But I never complained.  I swallowed it.  I made the best\nof a hard life.  We have all our burdens to bear.  But hark!  I hear the\ncock-crow, and snuff the morning air.\u201d  And with this the royal ghost\nvanishes up the chimney\u2014if there be a chimney in that dismal harem, where\npoor old Twoshoes and her companions pass their nights\u2014their dreary\nnights, their restless nights, their cold long nights, shared in what\nglum companionship, illumined by what a feeble taper!\n\n\u201cDid I understand you, my good Twoshoes, to say that your mother was\nseven-and-twenty years old when you were born, and that she married your\nesteemed father when she herself was twenty-five? 1745, then, was the\ndate of your dear mother\u2019s birth.  I daresay her father was absent in the\nLow Countries, with his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland, under whom\nhe had the honour of carrying a halberd at the famous engagement of\nFontenoy\u2014or if not there, he may have been at Preston Pans, under General\nSir John Cope, when the wild Highlanders broke through all the laws of\ndiscipline and the English lines; and, being on the spot, did he see the\nfamous ghost which didn\u2019t appear to Colonel Gardner of the Dragoons?  My\ngood creature, is it possible you don\u2019t remember that Doctor Swift, Sir\nRobert Walpole (my Lord Orford, as you justly say), old Sarah\nMarlborough, and little Mr Pope, of Twitnam, died in the year of your\nbirth?  What a wretched memory you have!  What? haven\u2019t they a library,\nand the commonest books of reference at the old convent of Saint Lazarus,\nwhere you dwell?\u201d\n\n\u201cConvent of Saint Lazarus, Prince William, Dr Swift, Atossa, and Mr Pope,\nof Twitnam!  What is the gentleman talking about?\u201d says old goody, with a\n\u201cHo! ho!\u201d and a laugh like a old parrot\u2014you know they live to be as old\nas Methuselah, parrots do, and a parrot of a hundred is comparatively\nyoung (ho! ho! ho!).  Yes, and likewise carps live to an immense old age.\nSome which Frederick the Great fed at Sans Souci are there now, with\ngreat humps of blue mould on their old backs; and they could tell all\nsorts of queer stories, if they chose to speak\u2014but they are very silent,\ncarps are\u2014of their nature _peu communicatives_.  Oh! what has been thy\nlong life, old goody, but a dole of bread and water and a perch on a\ncage; a dreary swim round and round a Lethe of a pond?  What are Rossbach\nor Jena to those mouldy ones, and do they know it is a grandchild of\nEngland who brings bread to feed them?\n\nNo!  Those Sans Souci carps may live to be a thousand years old and have\nnothing to tell but that one day is like another; and the history of\nfriend Goody Twoshoes has not much more variety than theirs.  Hard\nlabour, hard fare, hard bed, numbing cold all night, and gnawing hunger\nmost days.  That is her lot.  Is it lawful in my prayers to say, \u201cThank\nheaven, I am not as one of these\u201d?  If I were eighty, would I like to\nfeel the hunger always gnawing, gnawing? to have to get up and make a bow\nwhen Mr Bumble the beadle entered the common room? to have to listen to\nMiss Prim, who came to give me her ideas of the next world?  If I were\neighty, I own I should not like to have to sleep with another gentleman\nof my own age, gouty, a bad sleeper, kicking in his old dreams, and\nsnoring; to march down my vale of years at word of command, accommodating\nmy tottering old steps to those of the other prisoners in my dingy,\nhopeless old gang; to hold out a trembling hand for a sickly pittance of\ngruel, and say, \u201cThank you, ma\u2019am,\u201d to Miss Prim, when she has done\nreading her sermon.  John! when Goody Twoshoes comes next Friday, I\ndesire she may not be disturbed by theological controversies.  You have a\nfair voice, and I heard you and the maids singing a hymn very sweetly the\nother night, and was thankful that our humble household should be in such\nharmony.  Poor old Twoshoes is so old and toothless and quaky, that she\ncan\u2019t sing a bit; but don\u2019t be giving yourself airs over her, because she\ncan\u2019t sing and you can.  Make her comfortable at our kitchen hearth.  Set\nthat old kettle to sing by our hob.  Warm her old stomach with nut-brown\nale and a toast laid in the fire.  Be kind to the poor old school-girl of\nninety, who has had leave to come out for a day of Christmas holiday.\nShall there be many more Christmases for thee?  Think of the ninety she\nhas seen already; the four-score and ten cold, cheerless, nipping New\nYears!\n\nIf you were in her place, would you like to have a remembrance of better\nearly days, when you were young and happy, and loving, perhaps; or would\nyou prefer to have no past on which your mind could rest?  About the year\n1788, Goody, were your cheeks rosy, and your eyes bright, and did some\nyoung fellow in powder and a pigtail look in them?  We may grow old, but\nto us some stories never are old.  On a sudden they rise up, not dead,\nbut living\u2014not forgotten, but freshly remembered.  The eyes gleam on us\nas they used to do.  The dear voice thrills in our hearts.  The rapture\nof the meeting, the terrible, terrible parting, again and again the\ntragedy is acted over.  Yesterday, in the street, I saw a pair of eyes so\nlike two which used to brighten at my coming once, that the whole past\ncame back as I walked lonely, in the rush of the Strand, and I was young\nagain in the midst of joys and sorrows, alike sweet and sad, alike sacred\nand fondly remembered.\n\nIf I tell a tale out of school, will any harm come to my old school-girl?\nOnce, a lady gave her a half-sovereign, which was a source of great pain\nand anxiety to Goody Twoshoes.  She sewed it away in her old stays\nsomewhere, thinking here at least was a safe investment\u2014(vestis\u2014a vest\u2014an\ninvestment,\u2014pardon me, thou poor old thing, but I cannot help the\npleasantry).  And what do you think?  Another pensionnaire of the\nestablishment cut the coin out of Goody\u2019s stays\u2014_an old woman who went\nupon two crutches_!  Faugh, the old witch!  What?  Violence amongst these\ntoothless, tottering, trembling, feeble ones?  Robbery amongst the\npenniless?  Dogs coming and snatching Lazarus\u2019s crumbs out of his lap?\nAh, how indignant Goody was as she told the story!  To that pond at\nPotsdam where the carps live for hundreds of hundreds of years, with\nhunches of blue mould on their back, I daresay the little Prince and\nPrincess of Preussen-Britannien come sometimes with crumbs and cakes to\nfeed the mouldy ones.  Those eyes may have goggled from beneath the weeds\nat Napoleon\u2019s jack-boots: they have seen Frederick\u2019s lean shanks\nreflected in their pool; and perhaps Monsieur de Voltaire has fed them,\nand now for a crumb of biscuit they will fight, push, hustle, rob,\nsquabble, gobble, relapsing into their tranquillity when the ignoble\nstruggle is over.  Sans souci, indeed!  It is mighty well writing \u201cSans\nsouci\u201d over the gate; but where is the gate through which Care has not\nslipped?  She perches on the shoulders of the sentry in the sentry-box:\nshe whispers the porter sleeping in his arm-chair: she glides up the\nstaircase, and lies down between the king and queen in their bed-royal:\nthis very night I daresay she will perch upon poor old Goody Twoshoes\u2019\nmeagre bolster, and whisper, \u201cWill the gentleman and those ladies ask me\nagain!  No, no; they will forget poor old Twoshoes.\u201d Goody!  For shame of\nyourself!  Do not be cynical.  Do not mistrust your fellow-creatures.\nWhat?  Has the Christmas morning dawned upon thee ninety times?  For\nfour-score and ten years has it been thy lot to totter on this earth,\nhungry and obscure? Peace and goodwill to thee, let us say at this\nChristmas season.  Come, drink, eat, rest awhile at our hearth, thou poor\nold pilgrim!  And of the bread which God\u2019s bounty gives us, I pray,\nbrother reader, we may not forget to set aside a part for those noble and\nsilent poor, from whose innocent hands war has torn the means of labour.\nEnough!  As I hope for beef at Christmas, I vow a note shall be sent to\nSaint Lazarus Union House, in which Mr Roundabout requests the honour of\nMrs Twoshoes\u2019 company on Friday, 26th December.\n\n\n\n\nDE JUVENTUTE\n\n\nWE who lived before railways, and survive out of the ancient world, are\nlike Father Noah and his family out of the Ark.  The children will gather\nround and say to us patriarchs, \u201cTell us, grandpapa, about the old\nworld.\u201d  And we shall mumble our old stories; and we shall drop off one\nby one; and there will be fewer and fewer of us, and these very old and\nfeeble.  There will be but ten pr\u00e6-railroadites left: then three\u2014then\ntwo\u2014then one\u2014then 0!  If the hippopotamus had the least sensibility (of\nwhich I cannot trace any signs either in his hide or his face), I think\nhe would go down to the bottom of his tank, and never come up again.\nDoes he not see that he belongs to bygone ages, and that his great\nhulking barrel of a body is out of place in these times?  What has he in\ncommon with the brisk young life surrounding him?  In the watches of the\nnight, when the keepers are asleep, when the birds are on one leg, when\neven the little armadillo is quiet, and the monkeys have ceased their\nchatter, he\u2014I mean the hippopotamus\u2014and the elephant, and the long-necked\ngiraffe, perhaps may lay their heads together and have a colloquy about\nthe great silent antediluvian world which they remember, where mighty\nmonsters floundered through the ooze, crocodiles basked on the banks, and\ndragons darted out of the caves and waters before men were made to slay\nthem.  We who lived before railways are antediluvians\u2014we must pass away.\nWe are growing scarcer every day; and old\u2014old\u2014very old relicts of the\ntimes when George was still fighting the Dragon.\n\nNot long since, a company of horseriders paid a visit to our\nwatering-place.  We went to see them, and I bethought me that young\nWalter Juvenis, who was in the place, might like also to witness the\nperformance.  A pantomime is not always amusing to persons who have\nattained a certain age; but a boy at a pantomime is always amused and\namusing, and to see his pleasure is good for most hypochondriacs.\n\nWe sent to Walter\u2019s mother, requesting that he might join us, and the\nkind lady replied that the boy had already been at the morning\nperformance of the equestrians, but was most eager to go in the evening\nlikewise.  And go he did; and laughed at all Mr Merryman\u2019s remarks,\nthough he remembered them with remarkable accuracy, and insisted upon\nwaiting to the very end of the fun, and was only induced to retire just\nbefore its conclusion by representations that the ladies of the party\nwould be incommoded if they were to wait and undergo the rush and trample\nof the crowd round about.  When this fact was pointed out to him, he\nyielded at once, though with a heavy heart, his eyes looking longingly\ntowards the ring as we retreated out of the booth.  We were scarcely\nclear of the place, when we heard \u201cGod save the Queen,\u201d played by the\nequestrian band, the signal that all was over.  Our companion entertained\nus with scraps of the dialogue on our way home\u2014precious crumbs of wit\nwhich he had brought away from that feast.  He laughed over them again as\nhe walked under the stars.  He has them now, and takes them out of the\npocket of his memory, and crunches a bit, and relishes it with a\nsentimental tenderness, too, for he is, no doubt, back at school by this\ntime; the holidays are over; and Doctor Birch\u2019s young friends have\nreassembled.\n\nQueer jokes, which caused a thousand simple mouths to grin!  As the jaded\nMerryman uttered them to the old gentleman with the whip, some of the old\nfolks in the audience, I daresay, indulged in reflections of their own.\nThere was one joke\u2014I utterly forget it\u2014but it began with Merryman saying\nwhat he had for dinner.  He had mutton for dinner, at one o\u2019clock, after\nwhich \u201che had to _come to business_.\u201d  And then came the point.  Walter\nJuvenis, Esq., Rev. Doctor Birch\u2019s, Market Rodborough, if you read this,\nwill you please send me a line, and let me know what was the joke Mr\nMerryman made about having his dinner?  _You_ remember well enough.  But\ndo I want to know?  Suppose a boy takes a favourite, long-cherished lump\nof cake out of his pocket, and offers you a bit?  _Merci_!  The fact is,\nI _don\u2019t_ care much about knowing that joke of Mr Merryman\u2019s.\n\nBut whilst he was talking about his dinner, and his mutton, and his\nlandlord, and his business, I felt a great interest about Mr M. in\nprivate life\u2014about his wife, lodgings, earnings, and general history, and\nI daresay was forming a picture of those in my mind:\u2014wife cooking the\nmutton; children waiting for it; Merryman in his plain clothes, and so\nforth; during which contemplation the joke was uttered and laughed at,\nand Mr M., resuming his professional duties, was tumbling over head and\nheels.  Do not suppose I am going, _sicut est mos_, to indulge in\nmoralities about buffoons, paint, motley, and mountebanking.  Nay, Prime\nMinisters rehearse their jokes; Opposition leaders prepare and polish\nthem: Tabernacle preachers must arrange them in their minds before they\nutter them.  All I mean is, that I would like to know any one of these\nperformers thoroughly, and out of his uniform: that preacher, and why in\nhis travels this and that point struck him; wherein lies his power of\npathos, humour, eloquence;\u2014that Minister of State, and what moves him,\nand how his private heart is working;\u2014I would only say that, at a certain\ntime of life certain things cease to interest: but about _some_ things\nwhen we cease to care, what will be the use of life, sight, hearing?\nPoems are written, and we cease to admire.  Lady Jones invites us, and we\nyawn; she ceases to invite us, and we are resigned.  The last time I saw\na ballet at the opera\u2014oh! it is many years ago\u2014I fell asleep in the\nstalls, wagging my head in insane dreams, and I hope affording amusement\nto the company, while the feet of five hundred nymphs were cutting\nflicflacs on the stage at a few paces distant.  Ah, I remember a\ndifferent state of things!  _Credite posteri_.  To see these\nnymphs\u2014gracious powers, how beautiful they were!  That leering, painted,\nshrivelled, thin-armed, thick-ankled old thing, cutting dreary capers,\ncoming thumping down on her board out of time\u2014_that_ an opera-dancer?\nPooh!  My dear Walter, the great difference between my time and yours,\nwho will enter life some two or three years hence, is that, now, the\ndancing women and singing women are ludicrously old, out of time, and out\nof tune; the paint is so visible, and the dinge and wrinkles of their\nwretched old cotton stockings, that I am surprised how anybody can like\nto look at them.  And as for laughing at me for falling asleep, I can\u2019t\nunderstand a man of sense doing otherwise.  In my time, _\u00e0 la bonne\nheure_.  In the reign of George IV., I give you my honour, all the\ndancers at the opera were as beautiful as Houris.  Even in William IV.\u2019s\ntime, when I think of Duvernay prancing in as the Bayad\u00e8re,\u2014I say it was\na vision of loveliness such as mortal eyes can\u2019t see nowadays.  How well\nI remember the tune to which she used to appear!  Kaled used to say to\nthe Sultan, \u201cMy lord, a troop of those dancing and singing gurls called\nBayaderes approaches,\u201d and, to the clash of cymbals, and the thumping of\nmy heart, in she used to dance!  There has never been anything like\nit\u2014never.  There never will be\u2014I laugh to scorn old people who tell me\nabout your Noblet, your Montessu, your Vistris, your Parisot\u2014pshaw, the\nsenile twaddlers!  And the impudence of the young men, with their music\nand their dancers of to-day!  I tell you the women are dreary old\ncreatures.  I tell you one air in an opera is just like another, and they\nsend all rational creatures to sleep.  Ah, Ronzi de Begnis, thou lovely\none!  Ah, Caradori, thou smiling angel!  Ah, Malibran!  Nay, I will come\nto modern times, and acknowledge that Lablache was a very good singer\nthirty years ago (though Porto was the boy for me): and they we had\nAmbrogetti, and Curioni, and Donzelli, a rising young singer.\n\nBut what is most certain and lamentable is the decay of stage beauty\nsince the days of George IV.  Think of Sontag!  I remember her in\n_Otello_ and the _Donna del Lago_ in \u201928.  I remember being behind the\nscenes at the opera (where numbers of us young fellows of fashion used to\ngo), and seeing Sontag let her hair fall down over her shoulders previous\nto her murder by Donzelli.  Young fellows have never seen beauty like\n_that_, heard such a voice, seen such hair, such eyes.  Don\u2019t tell _me_!\nA man who has been about town since the reign of George IV., ought he not\nto know better than you young lads who have seen nothing?  The\ndeterioration of women is lamentable; and the conceit of the young\nfellows more lamentable still, that they won\u2019t see this fact, but persist\nin thinking their time as good as ours.\n\nBless me! when I was a lad, the stage was covered with angels, who sang,\nacted, and danced.  When I remember the Adelphi, and the actresses there:\nwhen I think of Miss Chester, and Miss Love, and Mrs Serle at Sadler\u2019s\nWells, and her forty glorious pupils\u2014of the Opera and Noblet, and the\nexquisite young Taglioni, and Pauline Leroux, and a host more!  One\nmuch-admired being of those days I confess I never cared for, and that\nwas the chief _male_ dancer\u2014a very important personage then, with a bare\nneck, bare arms, a tunic, and a hat and feathers, who used to divide the\napplause with the ladies, and who has now sunk down a trap-door for ever.\nAnd this frank admission ought to show that I am not your mere twaddling\n_laudator temporis acti_\u2014your old fogey who can see no good except in his\nown time.\n\nThey say that claret is better nowadays, and cookery much improved since\nthe days of _my_ monarch\u2014of George IV.  _Pastry Cookery_ is certainly not\nso good.  I have often eaten half-a-crown\u2019s worth (including, I trust,\nginger-beer) at our school pastrycook\u2019s, and that is a proof that the\npastry must have been very good, for could I do as much now?  I passed by\nthe pastrycook\u2019s shop lately, having occasion to visit my old school.  It\nlooked a very dingy old baker\u2019s; misfortunes may have come over him\u2014those\npenny tarts certainly did not look so nice as I remember them: but he may\nhave grown careless as he has grown old (I should judge him to be now\nabout ninety-six years of age), and his hand may have lost its cunning.\n\nNot that we were not great epicures.  I remember how we constantly\ngrumbled at the quantity of the food in our master\u2019s house\u2014which on my\nconscience I believe was excellent and plentiful\u2014and how we tried once or\ntwice to eat him out of house and home.  At the pastrycook\u2019s we may have\nover-eaten ourselves (I have admitted half-a-crown\u2019s worth for my own\npart, but I don\u2019t like to mention the _real_ figure for fear of\nperverting the present generation of boys by my monstrous confession)\u2014we\nmay have eaten too much, I say.  We did; but what then?  The school\napothecary was sent for: a couple of small globules at night, a trifling\npreparation of senna in the morning, and we had not to go to school, so\nthat the draught was an actual pleasure.\n\nFor our amusements, besides the games in vogue, which were pretty much in\nold times as they are now (except cricket _par exemple_\u2014and I wish the\npresent youth joy of their bowling, and suppose Armstrong and Whitworth\nwill bowl at them with light field-pieces next), there were novels\u2014ah! I\ntrouble you to find such novels in the present day!  O Scottish Chiefs,\ndidn\u2019t we weep over you! O Mysteries of Udolpho, didn\u2019t I and Briggs\nMinor draw pictures out of you, as I have said?  Efforts, feeble indeed,\nbut still giving pleasure to us and our friends.  \u201cI say, old boy, draw\nus Vivaldi tortured in the Inquisition,\u201d or, \u201cDraw us Don Quixote and the\nwindmills, you know,\u201d amateurs would say, to boys who had a love of\ndrawing.  \u201cPeregrine Pickle\u201d we liked, our fathers admiring it, and\ntelling us (the sly old boys) it was capital fun; but I think I was\nrather bewildered by it, though \u201cRoderick Random\u201d was and remains\ndelightful.  I don\u2019t remember having Sterne in the school library, no\ndoubt because the works of that divine were not considered decent for\nyoung people.  Ah! not against thy genius, O father of Uncle Toby and\nTrim, would I say a word in disrespect.  But I am thankful to live in\ntimes when men no longer have the temptation to write so as to call\nblushes on women\u2019s cheeks, and would shame to whisper wicked allusions to\nhonest boys.  Then, above all, we had WALTER SCOTT, the kindly, the\ngenerous, the pure\u2014the companion of what countless delightful hours; the\npurveyor of how much happiness; the friend whom we recall as the constant\nbenefactor of our youth! How well I remember the type and the brownish\npaper of the old duodecimo \u201cTales of My Landlord!\u201d  I have never dared to\nread the \u201cPirate,\u201d and the \u201cBride of Lammermoor,\u201d or \u201cKenilworth,\u201d from\nthat day to this, because the finale is unhappy, and people die, and are\nmurdered at the end.  But \u201cIvanhoe,\u201d and \u201cQuentin Durward\u201d!  Oh! for a\nhalf-holiday, and a quiet corner, and one of those books again!  Those\nbooks, and perhaps those eyes with which we read them; and, it may be,\nthe brains behind the eyes! It may be the tart was good; but how fresh\nthe appetite was!  If the gods would give me the desire of my heart, I\nshould be able to write a story which boys would relish for the next few\ndozen of centuries.  The boy-critic loves the story: grown up, he loves\nthe author who wrote the story.  Hence the kindly tie is established\nbetween writer and reader, and lasts pretty nearly for life.  I meet\npeople now who don\u2019t care of Walter Scott, or the \u201cArabian Nights\u201d; I am\nsorry for them, unless they in their time have found _their_\nromancer\u2014their charming Scheherazade.  By the way, Walter, when you are\nwriting, tell me who is the favourite novelist in the fourth form now?\nHave you got anything so good and kindly as dear Miss Edgeworth\u2019s\n_Frank_?  It used to belong to a fellow\u2019s sisters generally; but though\nhe pretended to despise it, and said, \u201cOh, stuff for girls!\u201d he read it;\nand I think there were one or two passages which would try my eyes now,\nwere I to meet with the little book.\n\nAs for Thomas and Jeremiah (it is only my witty way of calling Tom and\nJerry), I went to the British Museum the other day on purpose to get it;\nbut somehow, if you will press the question so closely, on reperusal, Tom\nand Jerry is not so brilliant as I had supposed it to be.  The pictures\nare just as fine as ever; and I shook hands with broad-backed Jerry\nHawthorn and Corinthian Tom with delight, after many year\u2019s absence.  But\nthe style of the writing, I own, was not pleasing to me; I even thought\nit a little vulgar\u2014well! well! other writers have been considered\nvulgar\u2014and as a description of the sports and amusements of London in the\nancient times, more curious than amusing.\n\nBut the pictures!\u2014oh! the pictures are noble still!  First, there is\nJerry arriving from the country, in a green coat and leather gaiters, and\nbeing measured for a fashionable suit at Corinthian House, by Corinthian\nTom\u2019s tailor.  Then away for the career of pleasure and fashion.  The\npark! delicious excitement! The theatre! the saloon!! the green-room!!!\nRapturous bliss\u2014the opera itself! and then perhaps to Temple Bar, to\n_knock down a Charley_ there!  There are Jerry and Tom, with their tights\nand little cocked hats, coming from the opera\u2014very much as gentlemen in\nwaiting on royalty are habited now.  There they are at Almack\u2019s itself,\namidst a crowd of high-bred personages, with the Duke of Clarence himself\nlooking at them dancing.  Now, strange change, they are in Tom Cribb\u2019s\nparlour, where they don\u2019t seem to be a whit less at home than in\nfashion\u2019s gilded halls; and now they are at Newgate, seeing the irons\nknocked off the malefactors\u2019 legs previous to execution.  What hardened\nferocity in the countenance of the desperado in yellow breeches!  What\ncompunction in the face of the gentleman in black (who, I suppose, has\nbeen forging), and who clasps his hands, and listens to the chaplain!\nNow we haste away to merrier scenes: to Tattersall\u2019s (ah gracious powers!\nwhat a funny fellow that actor was who performed Dicky Green in that\nscene in the play!); and now we are at a private party, at which\nCorinthian Tom is waltzing (and very gracefully too, as you must confess)\nwith Corinthian Kate, whilst Bob Logic, the Oxonian, is playing on the\npiano!\n\n\u201cAfter,\u201d the text says, \u201c_the Oxonian_ had played several pieces of\nlively music, he requested as a favour that Kate and his friend Tom would\nperform a waltz.  Kate without any hesitation immediately stood up.  Tom\noffered his hand to his fascinating partner, and the dance took place.\nThe plate conveys a correct representation of the \u2018gay scene\u2019 at that\nprecise moment.  The anxiety of the _Oxonian_ to witness the attitudes of\nthe elegant pair had nearly put a stop to their movements.  On turning\nround from the pianoforte and presenting his comical _mug_, Kate could\nscarcely suppress a laugh.\u201d\n\nAnd no wonder; just look at it now (as I have copied it to the best of my\nhumble ability), and compare Master Logic\u2019s countenance and attitude with\nthe splendid elegance of Tom!  Now every London man is weary and _blas\u00e9_.\nThere is an enjoyment of life in these young bucks of 1823 which\ncontrasts strangely with our feelings of 1860.  Here, for instance, is a\nspecimen of their talk and walk, \u201cIf,\u2019 says LOGIC\u2014\u2018if _enjoyment_ is your\n_motto_, you may make the most of an evening at Vauxhall, more than at\nany other place in the metropolis.  It is all free and easy.  Stay as\nlong as you like, and depart when you think proper.\u2019\u2014\u2018Your description is\nso flattering,\u2019 replied JERRY, \u2018that I do not care how soon the time\narrives for us to start.\u2019  LOGIC proposed a \u2018_bit of a stroll_\u2019 in order\nto get rid of an hour or two, which was immediately accepted by Tom and\nJerry.  A _turn_ or two in Bond Street, a _stroll_ through Piccadilly, a\n_look in_ at TATTERSALL\u2019s, a _ramble_ through Pall Mall, and a _strut_ on\nthe Corinthian path, fully occupied the time of our heroes until the hour\nfor dinner arrived, when a few glasses of TOM\u2019s rich wines soon put them\non the _qui vive_.  VAUXHALL was then the object in view, and the TRIO\nstarted, bent upon enjoying the pleasures which this place so amply\naffords.\u201d\n\nHow nobly those inverted commas, those italics, those capitals, bring out\nthe writer\u2019s wit and relieve the eye!  They are as good as jokes, though\nyou mayn\u2019t quite preceive the point.  Mark the varieties of lounge in\nwhich the young men indulge\u2014now a _stroll_, then a _look in_, then a\n_ramble_, and presently a _strut_.  When George, Prince of Wales, was\ntwenty, I have read in an old Magazine, \u201cthe Prince\u2019s lounge\u201d was a\npeculiar manner of walking which the young bucks imitated.  At Windsor\nGeorge III. had a _cat\u2019s path_\u2014a sly early walk which the good old king\ntook in the grey morning before his household was astir.  What was the\nCorinthian path here recorded?  Does any antiquary know?  And what were\nthe rich wines which our friends took, and which enable them to enjoy\nVauxhall?  Vauxhall is gone, but the wines which could occasion such a\ndelightful perversion of the intellect as to enable it to enjoy ample\npleasures there, what were they?\n\nSo the game of life proceeds, until Jerry Hawthorn, the rustic, is fairly\nknocked up by all this excitement and is forced to go home, and the last\npicture represents him getting into the coach at the \u201cWhite Horse\nCellar,\u201d he being one of six inside; whilst his friends shake him by the\nhand; whilst the sailor mounts on the roof; whilst the Jews hang round\nwith oranges, knives, and sealing-wax: whilst the guard is closing the\ndoor.  Where are they now, those sealing-wax vendors? where are the\nguards? where are the jolly teams? where are the coaches? and where the\nyouth that climbed inside and out of them; that heard the merry horn\nwhich sounds no more; that saw the sun rise over Stonehenge; that rubbed\naway the bitter tears at night after parting as the coach sped on the\njourney to school and London; that looked out with beating heart as the\nmilestones flew by, for the welcome corner where began home and holidays.\n\nIt is night now: and here is home.  Gathered under the quiet roof elders\nand children lie alike at rest.  In the midst of a great peace and calm,\nthe stars look out from the heavens.  The silence is peopled with the\npast; sorrowful remorses for sins and shortcomings\u2014memories of passionate\njoys and griefs rise out of their graves, both now alike calm and sad.\nEyes, as I shut mine, look at me, that have long ceased to shine.  The\ntown and the fair landscape sleep under the starlight, wreathed in the\nautumn mists.  Twinkling among the houses a light keeps watch here and\nthere, in what may be a sick chamber or two.  The clock tolls sweetly in\nthe silent air.  Here is night and rest.  An awful sense of thanks makes\nthe heart swell, and the head bow, as I pass to my room through the\nsleeping house, and feel as though a hushed blessing were upon it.\n\n\n\n\nROUND ABOUT THE CHRISTMAS TREE\n\n\nTHE kindly Christmas tree, from which I trust every gentle reader has\npulled out a bonbon or two, is yet all aflame whilst I am writing, and\nsparkles with the sweet fruits of its season.  You young ladies, may you\nhave plucked pretty giftlings from it; and out of the cracker sugar-plum\nwhich you have split with the captain or the sweet young curate may you\nhave read one of those delicious conundrums which the confectioners\nintroduce into the sweetmeats, and which apply to the cunning passion of\nlove.  Those riddles are to be read at _your_ age, when I daresay they\nare amusing.  As for Dolly, Merry, and Bell, who are standing at the\ntree, they don\u2019t care about the love-riddle part, but understand the\nsweet-almoned portion very well.  They are four, five, six years old.\nPatience, little people!  A dozen merry Christmases more, and you will be\nreading those wonderful love-conundrums, too.  As for us elderly folks,\nwe watch the babies at their sport, and the young people pulling at the\nbranches: and instead of finding bonbons or sweeties in the packets which\nwe pluck off the boughs, we find enclosed Mr Carnifex\u2019s review of the\nquarter\u2019s meat; Mr Sartor\u2019s compliments, and little statement for self\nand the young gentlemen; and Madame de Sainte-Crinoline\u2019s respects to the\nyoung ladies, who encloses her account, and will sent on Saturday,\nplease; or we stretch our hand out to the educational branch of the\nChristmas tree, and there find a lively and amusing article from the Rev.\nHenry Holyshade, containing our dear Tommy\u2019s exceedingly moderate account\nfor the last term\u2019s school expenses.\n\nThe tree yet sparkles, I say.  I am writing on the day before Twelfth\nDay, if you must know; but already ever so many of the fruits have been\npulled, and the Christmas lights have gone out.  Bobby Miseltow, who has\nbeen staying with us for a week (and who has been sleeping mysteriously\nin the bath-room), comes to say he is going away to spend the rest of the\nholidays with his grandmother\u2014and I brush away the manly tear of regret\nas I part with the dear child.  \u201cWell, Bob, good-bye, since you _will_\ngo.  Compliments to grandmamma.  Thank her for the turkey.  Here\u2019s \u2014\u201d\n(_A slight pecuniary transaction takes place at this juncture_, _and Bob\nnods and winks_, _and puts his hand in his waistcoat pocket_.)  \u201cYou have\nhad a pleasant week?\u201d\n\nBOB.\u2014\u201cHaven\u2019t I!\u201d  (_And exit_, _anxious to know the amount of the coin\nwhich has just changed hands_.)\n\nHe is gone, and as the dear boy vanishes through the door (behind which I\nsee him perfectly), I too cast up a little account of our past Christmas\nweek.  When Bob\u2019s holidays are over, and the printer has sent me back\nthis manuscript, I know Christmas will be an old story.  All the fruit\nwill be off the Christmas tree then; the crackers will have cracked off;\nthe almonds will have been crunched; and the sweet-bitter riddles will\nhave been read; the lights will have perished off the dark green boughs;\nthe toys growing on them will have been distributed, fought for,\ncherished, neglected, broken.  Ferdinand and Fidelia will each keep out\nof it (be still, my gushing heart!) the remembrance of a riddle read\ntogether, of a double almond munched together, and of the moiety of an\nexploded cracker. . . .  The maids, I say, will have taken down all that\nholly stuff and nonsense about the clocks, lamps, and looking-glasses,\nthe dear boys will be back at school, fondly thinking of the pantomime\nfairies whom they have seen; whose gaudy gossamer wings are battered by\nthis time; and whose pink cotton (or silk is it?) lower extremities are\nall dingy and dusty.  Yet but a few days, Bob, and flakes of paint will\nhave cracked off the fairy flower-bowers, and the revolving temples of\nadamantine lustre will be as shabby as the city of Pekin.  When you read\nthis, will Clown still be going on lolling his tongue out of his mouth,\nand saying, \u201cHow are you to-morrow?\u201d  To-morrow, indeed!  He must be\nalmost ashamed of himself (if that cheek is still capable of the blush of\nshame) for asking the absurd question.  To-morrow, indeed!  To-morrow the\ndiffugient snows will give place to spring; the snowdrops will lift their\nheads; Ladyday may be expected, and the pecuniary duties peculiar to that\nfeast; in place of bonbons, trees will have an eruption of light green\nknobs; the whitebait season will bloom . . . as if one need go on\ndescribing these vernal phenomena, when Christmas is still here, though\nending, and the subject of my discourse!\n\nWe have all admired the illustrated papers, and noted how boisterously\njolly they become at Christmas time.  What wassail-bowls,\nrobin-redbreasts, waits, snow landscapes, bursts of Christmas song!  And\nthen to think that these festivities are prepared months before\u2014that\nthese Christmas pieces are prophetic!  How kind of artists and poets to\ndevise the festivities beforehand, and serve them pat at the proper time!\nWe ought to be grateful to them, as to the cook who gets up at midnight\nand sets the pudding a-boiling, which is to feast us at six o\u2019clock.  I\noften think with gratitude of the famous Mr Nelson Lee\u2014the author of I\ndon\u2019t know how many hundred glorious pantomimes\u2014walking by the summer\nwave at Margate, or Brighton perhaps, revolving in his mind the idea of\nsome new gorgeous spectacle of fa\u00ebry, which the winter shall see\ncomplete.  He is like cook at midnight (_si parva licet_).  He watches\nand thinks.  He pounds the sparkling sugar of benevolence, the plums of\nfancy, the sweetmeats of fun, the figs of\u2014well, the figs of fairy\nfiction, let us say, and pops the whole in the seething cauldron of\nimagination, and at due season serves up the PANTOMIME.\n\nVery few men in the course of nature can expect to see _all_ the\npantomimes in one season, but I hope to the end of my life I shall never\nforego reading about them in that delicious sheet of _The Times_ which\nappears on the morning after Boxing-day.  Perhaps reading is even better\nthan seeing.  The best way, I think, is to say you are ill, lie in bed,\nand have the paper for two hours, reading all the way down from Drury\nLane to the Britannia at Hoxton.  Bob and I went to two pantomimes.  One\nwas at the Theatre of Fancy, and the other at the Fairy Opera, and I\ndon\u2019t know which we liked the best.\n\nAt the Fancy, we saw \u201cHarlequin Hamlet, or Daddy\u2019s Ghost and Nunky\u2019s\nPison,\u201d which is all very well\u2014but, gentlemen, if you don\u2019t respect\nShakspeare, to whom will you be civil?  The palace and ramparts of\nElsinore by moon and snowlight is one of Loutherbourg\u2019s finest efforts.\nThe banqueting hall of the palace is illuminated: the peaks and gables\nglitter with the snow: the sentinels march blowing their fingers with the\ncold\u2014the freezing of the nose of one of them is very neatly and\ndexterously arranged: the snow storm rises: the winds howl awfully along\nthe battlements: the waves come curling, leaping, foaming to shore.\nHamlet\u2019s umbrella is whirled away in the storm.  He and his two friends\nstamp on each other\u2019s toes to keep them warm.  The storm-spirits rise in\nthe air, and are whirled howling round the palace and the rocks.  My\neyes! what tiles and chimney-pots fly hurtling through the air!  As the\nstorm reaches its height (here the wind instruments come in with\nprodigious effect, and I compliment Mr Brumby and the violoncellos)\u2014as\nthe snow storm rises (queek, queek, queek, go the fiddles, and then\nthrumpty thrump comes a pizzicato movement in Bob Major, which sends a\nshiver into your very boot-soles), the thunder-clouds deepen (bong, bong,\nbong, from the violoncellos).  The forked lightning quivers through the\nclouds in a zig-zag scream of violins\u2014and look, look, look! as the\nfrothing, roaring waves come rushing up the battlements, and over the\nreeling parapet, each hissing wave becomes a ghost, sends the\ngun-carriages rolling over the platform, and plunges into the water\nagain.\n\nHamlet\u2019s mother comes on to the battlements to look for her son.  The\nstorm whips her umbrella out of her hands, and she retires screaming in\npattens.\n\nThe cabs on the stand in the great market-place at Elsinore are seen to\ndrive off, and several people are drowned.  The gas-lamps along the\nstreet are wrenched from their foundations, and shoot through the\ntroubled air.  Whist, rush, hish! how the rain roars and pours!  The\ndarkness becomes awful, always deepened by the power of the music\u2014and\nsee\u2014in the midst of a rush, and whirl, and scream of spirits of air and\nwave\u2014what is that ghastly figure moving hither?  It becomes bigger,\nbigger, as it advances down the platform\u2014more ghastly, more horrible,\nenormous!  It is as tall as the whole stage.  It seems to be advancing on\nthe stalls and pit, and the whole house screams with terror, as the Ghost\nof THE LATE HAMLET comes in, and begins to speak.  Several people faint,\nand the light-fingered gentry pick pockets furiously in the darkness.\n\nIn the pitchy darkness, this awful figure throwing his eyes about, the\ngas in the boxes shuddering out of sight, and the wind-instruments\nbugling the most horrible wails, the boldest spectator must have felt\nfrightened.  But hark! what is that silver shimmer of the fiddles?  Is\nit\u2014can it be\u2014the grey dawn peeping in the stormy east?  The ghost\u2019s eyes\nlook blankly towards it, and roll a ghastly agony.  Quicker, quicker ply\nthe violins of Phoebus Apollo.  Redder, redder grow the orient clouds.\nCockadoodledoo! crows that great cock which has just come out on the roof\nof the palace.  And now the round sun himself pops up from behind the\nwaves of night.  Where is the ghost?  He is gone!  Purple shadows of morn\n\u201cslant o\u2019er the snowy sward,\u201d the city wakes up in life and sunshine, and\nwe confess we are very much relieved at the disappearance of the ghost.\nWe don\u2019t like those dark scenes in pantomimes.\n\nAfter the usual business, that Ophelia should be turned into Columbine\nwas to be expected; but I confess I was a little shocked when Hamlet\u2019s\nmother became Pantaloon, and was instantly knocked down by Clown\nClaudius.  Grimaldi is getting a little old now, but for real humour\nthere are few clowns like him.  Mr Shuter, as the gravedigger, was chaste\nand comic, as he always is, and the scene-painters surpassed themselves.\n\n\u201cHarlequin Conqueror and the Field of Hastings,\u201d at the other house, is\nvery pleasant too.  The irascible William is acted with great vigour by\nSnoxall, and the battle of Hastings is a good piece of burlesque.  Some\ntrifling liberties are taken with history, but what liberties will not\nthe merry genius of pantomime permit himself?  At the battle of Hastings,\nWilliam is on the point of being defeated by the Sussex volunteers, very\nelegantly led by the always pretty Miss Waddy (as Haco Sharpshooter),\nwhen a shot from the Normans kills Harold.  The Fairy Edith hereupon\ncomes forward, and finds his body, which straightway leaps up a live\nharlequin, whilst the Conqueror makes an excellent clown, and the\nArchbishop of Bayeux a diverting pantaloon, &c. &c. &c.\n\nPerhaps these are not the pantomimes we really saw; but one description\nwill do as well as another.  The plots, you see, are a little intricate\nand difficult to understand in pantomimes; and I may have mixed up one\nwith another.  That I was at the theatre on Boxing-night is certain\u2014but\nthe pit was so full that I could only see fairy legs glittering in the\ndistance, as I stood at the door.  And if I was badly off, I think there\nwas a young gentleman behind me worse off still.  I own that he has good\nreason (though others have not) to speak ill of me behind my back, and\nhereby beg his pardon.\n\nLikewise to the gentleman who picked up a party in Piccadilly, who had\nslipped and fallen in the snow, and was there on his back, uttering\nenergetic expressions: that party begs to offer thanks, and compliments\nof the season.\n\nBob\u2019s behaviour on New Year\u2019s day, I can assure Dr Holyshade, was highly\ncreditable to the boy.  He had expressed a determination to partake of\nevery dish which was put on the table; but after soup, fish, roast-beef,\nand roast-goose, he retired from active business until the pudding and\nmince-pies made their appearance, of which he partook liberally, but not\ntoo freely.  And he greatly advanced in my good opinion by praising the\npunch, which was of my own manufacture, and which some gentlemen present\n(Mr O\u2019M\u2014g\u2014n, amongst others) pronounced to be too weak.  Too weak! A\nbottle of rum, a bottle of Madeira, half a bottle of brandy, and two\nbottles and a half of water\u2014_can_ this mixture be said to be too weak for\nany mortal?  Our young friend amused the company during the evening, by\nexhibiting a two-shilling magic-lantern, which he had purchased, and\nlikewise by singing \u201cSally, come up!\u201d a quaint, but rather monotonous\nmelody, which I am told is sung by the poor negro on the banks of the\nbroad Mississippi.\n\nWhat other enjoyments did we proffer for the child\u2019s amusement during the\nChristmas week?  A great philosopher was giving a lecture to young folks\nat the British Institution.  But when this diversion was proposed to our\nyoung friend Bob, he said, \u201cLecture?  No, thank you.  Not as I knows on,\u201d\nand made sarcastic signals on his nose.  Perhaps he is of Dr Johnson\u2019s\nopinion about lectures: \u201cLectures, sir! what man would go to hear that\nimperfectly at a lecture, which he can read at leisure in a book?\u201d  _I_\nnever went, of my own choice, to a lecture; that I can vow.  As for\nsermons, they are different; I delight in them, and they cannot, of\ncourse, be too long.\n\nWell, we partook of yet other Christmas delights besides pantomime,\npudding, and pie.  One glorious, one delightful, one most unlucky and\npleasant day, we drove in a brougham, with a famous horse, which carried\nus more quickly and briskly than any of your vulgar railways, over\nBattersea Bridge, on which the horse\u2019s hoofs rung as if it had been iron;\nthrough suburban villages, plum-caked with snow; under a leaden sky, in\nwhich the sun hung like a red-hot warming-pan; by pond after pond, where\nnot only men and boys, but scores after scores of women and girls, were\nsliding, and roaring, and clapping their lean old sides with laughter, as\nthey tumbled down, and their hobnailed shoes flew up in the air; the air\nfrosty with a lilac haze, through which villas, and commons, and\nchurches, and plantations glimmered.  We drive up the hill, Bob and I; we\nmake the last two miles in eleven minutes; we pass that poor, armless man\nwho sits there in the cold, following you with his eyes.  I don\u2019t give\nanything, and Bob looks disappointed.  We are set down neatly at the\ngate, and a horse-holder opens the brougham door.  I don\u2019t give anything;\nagain disappointment on Bob\u2019s part.  I pay a shilling apiece, and we\nenter into the glorious building, which is decorated for Christmas, and\nstraightway forgetfulness on Bob\u2019s part of everything but that\nmagnificent scene.  The enormous edifice is all decorated for Bob and\nChristmas.  The stalls, the columns, the fountains, courts, statues,\nsplendours, are all crowned for Christmas.  The delicious negro is\nsinging his Alabama choruses for Christmas and Bob.  He has scarcely\ndone, when, Tootarootatoo!  Mr Punch is performing his surprising\nactions, and hanging the beadle.  The stalls are decorated.  The\nrefreshment-tables are piled with good things; at many fountains \u201cMULLED\nCLARET\u201d is written up in appetizing capitals.  \u201cMulled Claret\u2014oh, jolly!\nHow cold it is!\u201d says Bob; I pass on.  \u201cIt\u2019s only three o\u2019clock,\u201d says\nBob.  \u201cNo, only three,\u201d I say meekly.  \u201cWe dine at seven,\u201d sighs Bob,\n\u201cand it\u2019s so-o-o coo-old.\u201d  I still would take no hints.  No claret, no\nrefreshment, no sandwiches, no sausage-rolls for Bob.  At last I am\nobliged to tell him all.  Just before we left home, a little Christmas\nbill popped in at the door and emptied my purse at the threshold.  I\nforgot all about the transaction, and had to borrow half-a-crown from\nJohn Coachman to pay for our entrance into the palace of delight.  _Now_\nyou see, Bob, why I could not treat you on that second of January when we\ndrove to the palace together; when the girls and boys were sliding on the\nponds at Dulwich; when the darkling river was full of floating ice, and\nthe sun was like a warming-pan in the leaden sky.\n\nOne more Christmas sight we had, of course; and that sight I think I like\nas well as Bob himself at Christmas, and at all seasons.  We went to a\ncertain garden of delight, where, whatever your cares are, I think you\ncan manage to forget some of them, and muse, and be not unhappy; to a\ngarden beginning with a Z, which is as lively as Noah\u2019s ark; where the\nfox has brought his brush, and the cock has brought his comb, and the\nelephant has brought his trunk, and the kangaroo has brought his bag, and\nthe condor his old white wig and black satin hood.  On this day it was so\ncold that the white bears winked their pink eyes, as they plapped up and\ndown by their pool, and seemed to say, \u201cAha, this weather reminds us of\ndear home!\u201d  \u201cCold! bah!  I have got such a warm coat,\u201d says brother\nBruin, \u201cI don\u2019t mind\u201d; and he laughs on his pole, and clucks down a bun.\nThe squealing hy\u00e6nas gnashed their teeth and laughed at us quite\nrefreshingly at their window; and, cold as it was, Tiger, Tiger, burning\nbright, glared at us red-hot through his bars, and snorted blasts of\nhell.  The woolly camel leered at us quite kindly as he paced round his\nring on his silent pads.  We went to our favourite places.  Our dear\nwambat came up, and had himself scratched very affably.  Our\nfellow-creatures in the monkey room held out their little black hands,\nand piteously asked us for Christmas alms.  Those darling alligators on\ntheir rock winked at us in the most friendly way.  The solemn eagles sat\nalone, and scowled at us from their peaks; whilst little Tom Ratel\ntumbled over head and heels for us in his usual diverting manner.  If I\nhave cares in my mind, I come to the Zoo, and fancy they don\u2019t pass the\ngate.  I recognise my friends, my enemies, in countless cages.  I\nentertained the eagle, the vulture, the old billy-goat, and the\nblack-pated, crimson-necked, blear-eyed, baggy, hook-beaked old marabou\nstork yesterday at dinner; and when Bob\u2019s aunt came to tea in the\nevening, and asked him what he had seen, he stepped up to her gravely,\nand said\u2014\n\n    \u201cFirst I saw the white bear, then I saw the black,\n    Then I saw the camel with a hump upon his back.\n\n                            _Chorus of Children_.\n\n    Then I saw the camel with a HUMP upon his back!\n\n    Then I saw the grey wolf, with mutton in his maw;\n    Then I saw the wambat waddle in the straw;\n    Then I saw the elephant with his waving trunk,\n    Then I saw the monkeys\u2014mercy, how unpleasantly they\u2014smelt!\u201d\n\nThere.  No one can beat that piece of wit, can he Bob?  And so it is\nover; but we had a jolly time, whilst you were with us, hadn\u2019t we?\nPresent my respects to the doctor; and I hope, my boy, we may spend\nanother merry Christmas next year.\n\n\n\n",
