But when I look at\nMaria's picture on my desk, I realize it couldn't have been a dream.\nActually, it was only six months ago that I sat at this same desk,\nlooking at her picture, wondering what could have happened to her. It\nhad been six weeks since there had been any word from her, and she had\npromised to write as soon as she arrived in Europe. Considering that my\nfuture rested in her small hands, I had every right to be apprehensive.\n\nWe had grown up together, had lost our folks within a few years of each\nother and had been fond of each other the way kids are apt to be. Then\nthe change came: It seemed I loved her, and she was still just \"fond\" of\nme. During our early college days I sort of let things ride, but once we\nwent on to graduate school, I began to crowd her.\n\nThe next thing I knew, she had signed up with a student tour destined\nfor Central Europe, and told me she would give me my answer when she\nreturned. I had to be content with that, but couldn't help worrying.\nMaria was a strange girl--withdrawn, dreamy and soft-hearted. Knowing\nthe section she was going to, I was inclined to be uneasy, since it is\nthe realm of gypsies, fortune tellers and the like. It is also the\nbirthplace of many strange legends, and Maria claimed to be strongly\npsychic. As a matter of fact, she had foretold one or two things which\nwere probably coincidental, like the death of our parents, and which\neven made an impression on me--and you'd hardly call me a \"believer.\"\n\nThis so-called talent of hers led her into trouble on more than one\noccasion. I remember in her senior year at college she fell under the\nspell of a short, fat, greasy spook-reader with a strictly phony accent\nand all but gave her eye teeth away, until I realized something was\namiss, got to the bottom of it, and dispatched friend spook-reader\n_pronto_. If she should meet some unscrupulous person now, with no one\naround to get her out of the scrape--but I didn't want to think of that.\nI was sure this time everything would be all right.\n\nWhen she didn't write at first, I let it go that she was busy. Finally,\nsix weeks' silent treatment aroused my curiosity. It also aroused my\nnasty temper, and the next thing I knew I was on a plane bound for the\nContinent. Within two hours after landing, I found her at a little inn\nin Transylvania, a quaint little place that looked as if it were made of\ngingerbread, and was surrounded by the huge, craggy Transylvania\nMountain range. I also found Tod Hunter.\n\n\"What's wrong, Maria? Why didn't you write?\" I asked.\n\nHer usually gay, shining brown eyes flashed angrily. \"Why couldn't you\nleave me alone? I told you not to come after me. I came here so I could\nthink this out. For God's sake, Bill, can't you see I wanted to think?\nTo be by myself?\"\n\n\"But you promised to write,\" I persisted, wondering at this change in\nher, this impatience. Wondered, too, at her wraithlike slimness. She'd\nalways been curved in the right places.\n\n\"Maria has been studying much too diligently,\" Tod said slowly. \"She's\nalways tired lately. She hasn't been too well, either. Her throat\nbothers her.\"\n\n\n\nI wanted to punch his head in. For some reason I didn't like him. Not\nbecause I sensed his rivalry; I was above that. God knows I wanted her\nto be happy, above everything. It was just something about him that\nirritated me. An attitude. Not supercilious; I could have coped with\nthat. Rather, it was a calm imperturbability that seemed to speak his\nfaith in his eventual success, regardless of any effort on my part.\n\nI don't know how to fight that sort of strategy. I look like I am: blunt\nand obvious. Suddenly I didn't care if he was there.\n\n\"Maria. Ria, darling. This guy's no good for you, can't you see that?\nWhat do you know about him?\"\n\nShe looked at me, her eyes surprised and a little hurt. Then she looked\nat him, seemed to be looking _through_ him and into herself, if you know\nwhat I mean. A slow flush spread from the base of her throat, that thin,\nalmost transparent throat.\n\n\"All I have to know,\" she said softly. \"I love him.\"\n\nShe looked out the window. \"I'm going up into _Konigstein Mountain_, to\na small sanitarium for my health shortly; the doctor has told me I must\ngo away, and Tod has suggested this place. There Tod and I shall be\nmarried.\"\n\nI knew then how it felt to be on the receiving end of a monkey-punch.\nThat she had come to this decision because of my objections, I had not\nthe slightest doubt. She was going to marry someone about whom she knew\nabsolutely nothing. She was much more ill than she knew. Hunter was\nundoubtedly after her money; she was considerably well-off. Obviously\nshe was once more being influenced in the wrong direction.\n\n\"I won't let you!\" I warned. \"Give it some more time, if for nothing\nelse, then for old times' sake.\"\n\n\"How about me, Morris?\" Tod interrupted. \"You haven't asked me my\nfeelings on the subject. I happen to love Maria dearly. Have I no say\njust because you're a childhood friend of hers?\"\n\n\"Childhood friend! I was her whole family for years before she ever\nheard of you! I'll see you in hell before I let her marry you!\" I\nshouted. Looking back, I'm sure that had he said anything else, I would\nhave killed him, if Ria hadn't come between us.\n\n\"That's enough, Bill Morris! I've heard all I want to from you. I'm\ntwenty-three, and if I choose to marry Tod, I'll do so and there's\nnothing you can do about it. Now, please go.\"\n\n\"Okay, Ria,\" I said, \"if that's the way you want it. But I'm not\nthrough. If you won't protect yourself, I'll do it for you. I'd like to\nknow more about the mysterious Mr. Tod Hunter, American, and I do wish,\nfor your own sake, you'd do the same. I wouldn't care if you married\nKing Tut, so long as you knew all about him. People just don't marry\nstrangers; not if they're smart. For God's sake, ask him about himself!\"\n\n\"All right, Bill,\" she replied, smiling patiently. \"I'll ask him. Now,\ndo stop being childish.\"\n\n\"Okay, darling,\" I said sheepishly. \"But do me one more favor. Don't\nmarry him until I get back. Only a little while; give me a week. Just\nwait a little longer.\"\n\nAs I closed the door, I could still feel his smile, mocking--yet a\nlittle sad.\n\nBut Maria didn't wait. I was gone a week. I had walked my legs off\ntrying to track down the elusive Mister Hunter and discovered\nexactly--nothing. All his landlady could tell me was that he was an\nAmerican who had come to this climate for his health, and that he slept\nlate mornings. I was licked and I knew it. If I had been a pup, I would\nhave fitted my tail neatly between my legs and made for home. But I\nwasn't a pup, so I headed straight for Ria's flat to face the music.\n\n\n\nThey were waiting for me, she and Tod. When I saw her, I wished I were\ndead.\n\nShe lay in Tod's arms, her body a mere whisper of a body. White and cold\nshe was, like frozen milk on a cold winter's day. They were both dead.\n\nYou know how it is when at a wake someone views the deceased and says\nkindly, \"She's beautiful,\" and \"she\" isn't beautiful at all; just a\nmade-up, lifeless handful of clay. Dead as dead, and frightening. Well,\nit wasn't that way this time. Their fair skins were faintly pink-tinted\nand their blonde heads, hers ashen and his a reddish cast, gleamed\nbrightly. And they sat so close in the sofa before the fire, his head\nresting in the hollow of her throat. They looked--peaceful; no line\nmarred their faces. I almost fancied I saw them breathe. And on her\nthird finger, left hand, was the ring--a thin, platinum band. He had\nwon, and in winning somehow he had lost. How they had died and why they\nfound each other and death at the same time, I would probably never\nknow. I only knew one thing: I had to get away from there--quickly. I\nalmost ran the distance to my flat. Stumbled into the place and poured a\ntriple Scotch which I could scarcely hold. The Scotch seared my throat\nand tasted bitter; someone must have poured salt in it. Then I realized\nthat it was tears--my tears. I, Bill Morris, who hadn't cried since my\nfifth birthday--I was sobbing like a baby.\n\nI didn't call the police. That would mean I would have to go back and\nwatch them cover that lovely body, carry it away and submit it to untold\nindignities in order to ascertain the cause of death. The cleaning girl\nwould find them in the morning and would notify the police.\n\nBut it wasn't so simple as that. In the morning I found I couldn't shake\noff the guilt which possessed me. Even two bottles of Scotch hadn't\nhelped me to forget. I was dead drunk and cold sober at the same time.\n\nI phoned Ria's landlady and told her I had failed to reach the Hunters\nby phone, that I was sure something was amiss. Would she please go to\ntheir flat and see if anything was wrong.\n\nShe was amused. \"Really, Mr. Morris, you must be mistaken. Miss Maria\nwent out just an hour ago with her new husband. Surely you are jesting.\nWhy she has never looked better. So happy. They have left for\n_Konigstein_. They have also left you a note.\n\nI told her I would be right over, and hopped a cab. I began to think I\nwas losing my mind. I had seen them both--dead. The landlady had seen\nthem this morning--_alive!_\"\n\nWhen I arrived, the landlady looked at me for a long moment, taking in\nmy rough, dark-blue complexion, unpressed clothes, red-rimmed eyes, then\nwagged a finger playfully.\n\n\"You are playing a joke, no? A wedding joke, maybe. Here, too, we haze\nnewlyweds. But of course I understood. Who could help loving Miss Maria?\nBe of good heart, young man. For you there will be another, some day.\nBut I talk too much. Here is your letter.\"\n\nI went where I would be undisturbed, to the reading room of the library\non the same street as my flat. To the musty, oblong, dimly lit room\nwhose threshold sunshine and fresh air dared not cross. Without the\nsaving warmth of sunlight or the fresh, clean relief of sweet-smelling\nair, I read. Read, inhaling the pungent, sour smell of the Scotch I had\nconsumed during the long, sleepless night. Read, and then doubted that I\nhad read at all--but the blue ink on the white paper forced me to\nacknowledge its actuality. It had been written by Hunter, in a neat,\nscholar's script.\n\n_Dear Morris_: (It began)\n\n_Why should I not have wanted Maria? You did; others doubtless did. Why\nthen should she not be mine? There are many things worse than being\nmarried to me; she might have married a man who beat her!_\n\n_With her I have known the two happiest days of my life. I want no more\nthan that. I have no right to ask for more. Have we, any of us, a right\nto endless bliss on this earth? Hardly._\n\n_You thought of her welfare above all; for that I owe you some\nexplanation. You must be patient, you must believe, and in the end, you\nmust do as I ask._ You must.\n\n_You wanted to know about me--of my life before Maria. Before Maria? It\nseems strange to think about it. There is no life without Maria. Still,\nthere was a time when for me she didn't exist. I have been constantly\ngoing forward to the day when I would meet her, yet there was a time\nwhen I didn't know where I would find her, or even what her name would\nbe!_\n\n_It was chance that brought us together. For me, good chance; for you,\npossibly ill chance; for Maria? Only she can say. Some three years ago I\nwas studying in England under a Rhodes Scholarship. The future held\ngreat things for me. I was a Yank like yourself, and damn proud of it.\nLife in England seemed strange and slow and sometimes utterly dismal\nunder Austerity. Then, little by little I slipped into their slower\nways, growing to love the people for their spunk, and finally coming to\nfeel I was one of them, so to speak._\n\n_I have said everything slowed down: I was wrong. Studying intensified\nfor me. The folklore of the British Isles intrigued me. I delved into\nthe Black Welsh tales, the mischievous fancies of the Irish, the English\nlegends of the prowling werewolf. For me it was a relief from political\nscience, which suddenly palled and which smacked of treason in the light\nof current events. My extracurricular research consumed the better part\nof my evenings. My books were and always have been a part of me, and as\nwas to be expected, I overdid it. I studied too hard with too little\nlet-up. Sometimes it seemed to me there was more truth to what I read\nthan myth. It became somewhat of an obsession. Suddenly, one night,\neverything blacked out._\n\n_I came to in a sanatorium. I didn't know how I got there, and when they\nexplained it to me, I laughed. I thought they were joking. When I tried\nto get up, to walk, I collapsed. Then I knew how bad it had been. I\nknew, too, I would have to go slowly._\n\n_It was there I met Eve. She was beautiful. Not like Maria, who is like\na fragile, fair, spun-sugar angel. Eve was more earthy, with skin like\nivory, creamy and rich and pale. Her blue-black hair she wore long and\ngathered in the back. She looked about twenty-five, but a streak of pure\nwhite ran back from each of her temples. She was the most striking woman\nI have ever met. I had never known anyone like her, nor have I since I\nsaw her last._\n\n_You know how it is: the air of mystery about a woman makes a man like a\nkid again. She reminded me of a sleek, black cat, with her large, hazel\neyes. I bumped into her one day on the verandah, and spent every day\nwith her after that._\n\n_The doctors wanted me to take exercise--short walks and the like, and\nEve went with me, struggling to keep up with me. The slightest effort\ntired her. She suffered from a rather nasty case of anemia. She seldom\nsmiled; the effort was probably too much for her. I saw her really smile\nonly once._\n\n_We had been on one of our short hikes in the woods close by the\ngrounds. She stumbled over a twig or a branch, I'm not sure which.\nSuddenly she was in my arms. Have you ever held a cloud in your arms,\nMorris? So light she was, although she was almost as tall as I. Warm and\npulsating. Her eyes held mine; it was almost uncanny. I have never been\naffected like that by a woman. Then I was kissing her; then a sharp\nsting, and I winced. There was the warm, salt taste of blood on my lips.\nI never knew how it happened. But she was smiling, her full mouth parted\nin the strangest smile I have ever seen. And those small white teeth\ngleamed; and in her eyes, which were all black pupils now, with the iris\nquite hidden, was desire--or something beyond desire. I couldn't define\nit then; now, I think I can. Her small, pink tongue darted over her\nlips, tasting, seeming to savor._\n\n_I was frightened, for some indefinable reason. I wanted to get away\nfrom her, from the woods, from myself. I grasped her arm roughly and we\nstarted back for the grounds. We never mentioned the episode again, but\nwe neither of us ever forgot. She intrigued me now, more than ever. The\ndoctors were able to satisfy my curiosity somewhat. They told me she had\nbeen a patient for some four years. Some days she was better, some days\nworse. She needed rest--much rest. Most days she slept past noon with\ntheir approval. Some days there was a faint flush beneath that ivory\nskin; other days it was pale and cool._\n\n_Just when we became lovers, I scarcely remember. Things were happening\nso fast I could barely keep pace with them. There was a magnetism about\nEve which compelled. I couldn't have resisted if I'd wanted to--and I\ndidn't._\n\n_I began to have long periods of lassitude, times when I would black out\nand remember nothing afterwards. And the dreams began. I would dream I\nwas stroking a large, velvety-black cat, a cat with shining yellow eyes\nthat looked at me as if they knew my every thought. I would stroke it\ncontinuously and it would nip me playfully. Then, one night the dream\nintensified: I was playing with the creature, caressing it gently, when\nof a sudden its lips drew back in a snarl, and without warning it sprang\nat my throat and buried its fangs deep! I thought I could feel life\nbeing drawn from me; I screamed._\n\n_The doctors told me afterwards that I was semi-conscious for days; that\nI had to be restrained._\n\n_When I was well again, Eve came to see me. She was gentle--soothing.\nShe held me close to her and oh! it was good to be alive and to belong\nto someone._\n\n_I remember to this day what she wore. Black velvet lounging slacks, a\nlow-necked amber satin blouse, caught at the \"V\" by a curiously wrought\nantique silver pin. It was round, about four inches in diameter. In its\ncenter was the carved figure of a serpent coiled to strike. Its eyes\nwere deep amber topazes and its darting tongue was raised and set with a\nblood-red ruby._\n\n_\"What an unusual pin, Eve,\" I said \"I've never seen it before, have\nI?\"_\n\n_\"No,\" she replied. \"It belongs to the deep, dark, seldom discussed\nskeleton in the Orcaczy closet, Tod. You see, my great-great grandmother\nwas quite a wicked lady, to hear tell. Went in for Witches' masses and\nthe like. They say she poisoned her husband, a rather elderly and very\nchildish man, for her lover, whom she subsequently married. Together\nthey did away with relatives who stood in the way of their accumulating\nmore money. This pin was the instrument of death.\"_\n\n_Her slim fingers pressed the ruby tongue and the pin opened, revealing\na space large enough to secrete powder._\n\n_\"It's like those employed by the infamous Borgias, as you can see,\" she\ncontinued, shrugging. \"Perhaps it was fate then, that her devoted new\nhusband tired of her once her fortune was assured him, took a young\nmistress for himself, and disposed of the unfortunate wife, using her\nown pin to perpetrate her murder. She was excommunicated by her church,\ntoo, which must have made it most unpleasant for her, poor old dear.\"\nThe slim shoulders straightened. \"But let's not discuss such unpleasant\nthings, my dear. The important thing now is for you to get well quickly.\nI've missed you terribly, you know.\"_\n\n_It was then I asked her to marry me. I knew I didn't really love her,\nbut there seemed nothing to prevent our marriage. And she had gotten\nunder my skin. It was as elemental as that. She said she thought we\nshould wait until I fully recovered._\n\n_\"Don't say any more, darling,\" she said. \"Rest your poor, sore\nthroat.\"_\n\n_She bent over me solicitously and I reached up to stroke that smooth\nblack hair. It had a familiar feel to it that I couldn't quite place. Of\ncourse I had stroked it hundreds of times before, but it wasn't that.\nThen she looked straight at me, those large, glowing hazel eyes boring\ninto mine, and I knew. Knew and disbelieved at the same time. I froze\nwhere I lay, paralyzed by my fear; unable to make a sound._\n\n_\"So you know,\" she whispered. \"It is well. I have marked you for my own\nthese many months. Now that you know, you will not fight. You know what\nI am, or at least you can guess. This pin you admired so--it was mine\nthree hundred years ago and it will always be mine!\"_\n\n_Her lips were on mine. She had never kissed me like this. It was like\nthe touch of hot ice, freezing, then searing. Unendurable. I lay inert;\nI couldn't have moved if I wanted to. I could scarcely breathe. Then I\nfelt the blood within me pounding, pulsing, beginning to answer in spite\nof myself. I tasted once more the warm, salty fluid on my lips. Eve's\nbody was liquid in my arms; warm, heady, narcotizing. Once again I felt\nthe agonizing, dagger sharp pain in my throat and--darkness._\n\n_Have you ever wakened to a bright, sunny afternoon and heard yourself\npronounced dead? They spoke in low, hushed tones. How unfortunate. Young\nfellow only thirty, dying so far away from his homeland. No family. Good\nthing he was well-set in life. This sudden anemia was most\nextraordinary; fellow showed no signs of it previously. All he had\nreally needed was rest. If he had recovered, that lovely Eve Orcaczy\nmight have made both their lives happier, richer. Sad ending to what\nmight have been an idyll. Good of her to claim the body. She said she\nwas going to inter it in the family vault in_ Konigstein Mountain _in\nTransylvania._\n\n_I heard them distinctly. I wanted to shout that I wasn't dead; I wanted\nto wake up from this horrible nightmare. I was as alive as they. I knew\nI had to get out of there, some way; to get away from Eve, whom I now\nfeared. They left to make arrangements._\n\n_The lassitude crept through me without warning; I dozed in spite of\nmyself. And I dreamed again. I was a cat running, leaping through\nwindows, loping over the countryside, stopping for no one. I panted with\nmy exertions. Towns and cities flew by; I had to get someplace and\nquickly. Then the dream ended._\n\n_\"Tod,\" she said, \"Get up, my dear.\" I heard Her and I hated Her. Hated\nHer while I was drawn to Her. There was a white mist before my eyes. I\nreached up to brush it away. It was not a mist; it was a cloth. I\nshivered._\n\n_\"I must wake up,\" I whispered hoarsely, \"I must! I'm going mad!\"_\n\n_There was a creaking sound and daylight descended upon me. When I saw\nwhere I was, I covered my face with my hands and sobbed. I tried to\npray, but the words froze on my lips._ I was sitting in a coffin in a\nmausoleum! I had been buried alive!\n\n_\"What am I?\" I shrieked. \"Where am I and what have You done? I'm out of\nmy mind; stark, staring mad!\"_\n\n_Eve's lips parted, showing the even white teeth--those slightly pointed\nteeth._\n\n_\"You're quite sane, my dear,\" She said calmly. \"You are now one of us;\na revenant, even as I, and to live you must feed on the living.\"_\n\n_\"It's not true!\" I shouted. \"This is all a crazy nightmare, part of my\nillness! You're not real! Nothing is real!\"_\n\n_\"I'm quite real, Tod. To be trite, I am what I am, and have accepted it\ncalmly, as you shall in time. I have told you of my life. You have been\na student of legends. Legends are often--more often than you\nthink--reality. When one has been murdered, if one has lived a so-called\nwicked life, he is doomed to walk the earth battening on the living. My\nfate was sealed as I lay in my coffin. But that wasn't enough. As I lay\nthere, my pet cat, Suma, slunk into the room and leapt over me. That was\na double insurance of my life after death. Those whom I mark for my own\nmust, too, live on. Accept it, my dear. You have no other choice.\"_\n\n_\"No!\" I cried. \"I'm an American! Things like this don't happen to us!\nIt's only in stories, and then to foreigners!\"_\n\n_She chuckled drily. \"I'm afraid these things do happen, and in this\ncase, you're it, my dear. Make the best of it.\"_\n\n_But I wouldn't; I refused to--for a while. I would not feast on the\nblood of the living. Something within me fought. For a time._\n\n_Then, the awful hunger began. The tearing pangs of hunger that ordinary\nfood wouldn't arrest. I fought it as long as I could. I lost._\n\n_First it was small animals; animals that I loved. It was my life or\ntheirs. Then there was a little girl; a dear little creature who might\nhave been my child under different circumstances._\n\n_After the episode of the little girl, Eve left me. She had no further\nuse for me; she had wanted the child, too, and I had got it. I was now\ncompetition to be shunned. I was alone once again alone and thoroughly\nmiserable. I couldn't understand myself, my motives, so how could I\nexpect someone else to understand?_\n\n_I only knew what I was; nor could I rationalize on why I had become\nthis way. I could only presume it had happened to others equally as\ninnocent as myself of wrong-doing. In the daytime, when I was like\nothers, I reproached myself; goodness knows I loathed myself and what I\nhad to do in order to \"live.\" I wished I might really die, for I was\ntired--so frightfully tired and sick of it all. But I knew of no way to\naccomplish this, so I had to bear it all, fasting until my voracious,\ndisgusting appetites got the better of me._\n\n_I decided there must be some information on my kind, particularly in\nthis area where vampire legends are rife, so I took to haunting reading\nrooms. It was there I met Maria. She told me, after we knew each other\nbetter, that she was doing graduate work in regional superstitions and\nhad decided that her thesis would treat of the history of vampirism. She\nfound it terribly amusing, but at the same time frightening: Didn't I? I\nfear I saw nothing laughable about it, but I held my peace. Why, I could\nhave done a thesis for her that would have driven some mild-mannered\nprof completely out of his mind! I kept my knowledge to myself, though;\nI didn't want to scare Maria._\n\n_She was like a flash of sunshine in a darkened room. She made each day\nworth living. For the first time the hunger pangs ceased. Ceased for one\nweek, then two. I was certain I was cured. Perhaps, I thought, the whole\nthing was just a dream and I am finally awake._\n\n_I felt then I had the right to tell her of my love. She looked\ninfinitely sad. She wasn't certain, she said. She knew she was awfully\nfond of me, but she was confused. She had just come away from the\nStates, trying to make up her mind about someone dear, whom she didn't\nwant to hurt, and she wanted a breather. I said I would wait up to and\nthrough eternity, if she wished._\n\n_Things, went along peacefully then. We would walk for hours together,\nwalk in complete silence and understanding. My strength seemed to be\nreturning more day by day. We went far afield in search of material for\nher thesis. She would track down the most minute speck of hearsay, to\nget authenticity._\n\n_One day, in our wanderings, I thoughtlessly let myself be led too near\nmy resting place. One of the locals mentioned a \"place of horror\" nearby\nand Maria wanted to investigate. I had no choice. We poked amid the\nstill fustiness of the deserted mausoleum I knew so well. She thought it\nodd that the door was unlocked. I said, yes, wasn't it. Then she saw the\nbox, that gleaming copper box which Eve had so thoughtfully provided.\nShe stroked it gently, commenting on its beauty, and before I could\nprevent it or divert her attention, she had lifted the heavy lid\nexposing the disarranged shroud, the remains of one or two hapless small\ncreatures, the horrible blood-stained satin lining. She screamed and\ndropped the lid, somehow pinching her finger. She hopped on one foot, as\none usually does to fight down sudden pain. Then she was clinging to me,\nthoroughly frightened._\n\n_\"What does it mean, Tod?\"_\n\n_I quieted her with the usual platitudes. Then I was kissing that poor,\nred little finger. Without warning to myself or her, I nipped it\naffectionately. A warm glow spread through me; there was a taste more\ndelightful than fine old brandy, or vintage wine, and I knew irrevocably\nthat I was not cured; no, nor ever should be! And I knew, too, that I\nwanted Maria--not just as a man longs for the woman he loves--but to\ndrink of the fountain of her life, that warm, intoxicating fountain,\ngreedily, joyously. She never knew what went through my mind at that\nmoment. If I could have killed myself then, I would have, and with no\ncompunction. But there is more to killing a revenant than that. The\nChurch knows the procedure. I hurried Maria home as fast as I could and\ntold her I had to go away for a week on business. She believed me and\nsaid she would miss me. But I didn't go away. That night I fought a\nlosing battle with myself, and then and every night thereafter, I\nreturned to her, partook of her and slunk away, loathing myself. I knew\nthat I must soon kill the one being I loved above all others, kill, too,\nher immortal soul, and there was nothing I could do to prevent it._\n\n_She began to fade visibly. When I \"returned\" in a week, she was so ill\nthat a few steps tired her. Her appetite all but vanished. She seemed\ngenuinely glad to see me. She was beset by nightmares, she said. Could I\nhelp her get some rest? I took her to a physician who sagely prescribed\na change in climate, rest and a diet rich in blood and iron, gave her a\nprescription for sedatives, and called it a day._\n\n_You know how she looked when you saw her. The day was approaching when\nshe would have no more blood, when life as you know it would stop and\nshe would become like me. Somehow I couldn't take her with me without\nsome warning, but I didn't know how to do it. You see, since I was an\ninnocent victim myself. I could speak, could warn my intended victim,\nbecause although my soul had all but died, there was still a spark that\nevil hadn't touched. I knew she would think it a joke if I told her\nabout myself without warning._\n\n_Then, happily for me, you came along. I knew you would sense something\namiss and I didn't care. I was almost certain of her love, and I decided\nto seize the few minutes left me and devil take the hindmost! When you\ntold her to confront me, you gave me the happiest days of my life. For\nthis I thank you sincerely. For what I have done and will ask you to do,\nforgive me!_\n\n_Maria asked me directly, as you had known she would. I replied frankly,\nsparing her nothing. I told her that the fact that this life had been\nwished on me, as it were, gave me some rights, and that I could tell her\nhow to rid herself of me, if she wished. Then she turned to me, her\nlarge, lovely eyes thoughtful._\n\n_\"Tod, dearest,\" she said softly, \"I must die some day, really die, so\nwhat difference does it make when? I only know that I love you. Why wait\nuntil I'm decrepit and alone, with only a few memories to look back on?\nWhy not now, with you, where life doesn't really stop? With all I've\nread about this, don't you think I could free myself if I wished?\"_\n\n_I still wonder if she really believed me. We were married three days\nlater. I never told her what her life with me would be like--that one\nday I would desert her, fearing and hating her rivalry for the very\nsource of my life, and the ghastly chain would continue. I couldn't. I\nloved her so, Morris, can you understand that? I couldn't betray her\nthen and I can't now._\n\n_On the second night of our marriage, she died as you know it, in my\narms. I don't think she knows it yet. But it won't be long until she\ndoes discover it. We were quite alive when you found us; she was in an\nhypnotic state induced by her condition. She heard and saw nothing. But\nI knew. And I must keep my faith. I must, and you are the only one who\ncan help me._\n\n_If you will show this to a priest, he will gladly accompany you to the\nplace in_ Konigstein, _where we rest during the morning in a new \"bed\" I\nhad specially constructed for us. I couldn't bring Maria to that other\nbed of corruption. A map of how to get there is enclosed. There you will\nperform the ancient, effective rites, and you will lay us to rest\ntogether, as we wish. That is all I ask...._\n\n\n\nWhen I had finished reading I stared at nothing, trying to force myself\nto think. This was \"all\" he asked. In substance, he wished me to murder\nthe girl I loved. I could refuse; I could ignore his request. I could\neven doubt the verity of his statements. He might be a madman. But I\ndidn't doubt. I believed every word, and I knew I would do as he asked.\n\nThat she had gone willingly I didn't doubt. I no longer hated him so\nmuch; rather I pitied him, the hapless victim of a horrible chain of\ncircumstance.\n\n\n\nI found the priest, a venerable, gentle soul, after much searching. The\nyounger men had looked at me searchingly, laughed and told me to read\nthe Good Book for consolation, and to lay off the bottle. Father Kalman\nwas understanding, with the wisdom of the very old.\n\n\"Yes, my son,\" he said, \"I will go. Many might doubt, but I believe.\nLucifer roams the earth in many guises and must be recognized and\nexorcised.\"\n\nIt was five o'clock in the morning when we approached the mausoleum. The\nGood Father explained that the \"creatures of darkness\" had to be back in\ntheir resting places before the cock crew. At night they drew\nsustenance; during the morning they slept.\n\nThere was a gleaming copper casket. Tod had not lied. We approached it\nwarily. In it was nothing but grisly remains, bloodstains and dust. We\ndrew back, fearful. Then we saw the other, newer casket in richest\nmahogany, almost twice the width of the copper box: _Their bridal bed!_\n\nThey lay together, his arm about her. She wore a gown of palest blue,\nbut oh, that mockery of a gown! Stained it was with fresh blood which\nhad seeped onto it from him. Obviously she had not taken to prowling\nyet. His mouth was dark, rich with blood, slightly open in a half-smile.\nHis hand pressed her fair head close to his chest. She lay trustingly\nwithin the circle of his arm, like a small child. The priest crossed\nhimself. The bodies twitched slightly.\n\n\"You know what you must do,\" Father Kalman whispered.\n\nI nodded, the pit of my stomach churning madly. I couldn't do it! Not\nMaria, the lovely. But I knew I would; I had to. She must not wake again\nto see that blood-stained gown or to wonder at her husband's gory lips.\nShe should know rest, eternal rest.\n\nFather Kalman circled the box several times, ringing his small bell, and\nat one point laid a crucifix upon each of their chests. Their faces\nwrithed and I felt my skin creep.\n\nThen, chanting in a low, firm voice, the priest gave me the signal.\nTogether we drove two long stakes, dipped first in Holy Water, home,\npiercing their hearts simultaneously.\n\nThe bodies leapt forward in the box, straining against the stake, and a\nhorrible, drawn-out wail shattered the stillness of the tomb. The priest\ndropped to his knees and I clapped my hands over my ears, but the\ndreadful shriek penetrated. My stomach turned over and I retched. The\nGood Father followed suit. We were no supermen and our bodies and our\nvery souls revolted against this monstrous thing.\n\n\"Let us finish, my son,\" the priest said slowly, after a time, his face\nthe color of ashes. \"We must bury these dead, that they may sleep in\nconsecrated ground.\"\n\nI couldn't. I had to see her again before it was done. She lay, small\nand fragile as ever, her face calm, only there was no trace of life now.\nShe was still and white, as only the dead--the truly dead--are. Tod's\narm was flung across her chest, as if to protect her. I made myself move\nthe arm, resting her head upon his shoulder, where it belonged. Then, as\nI looked, there was just Maria. Tod was gone and only a handful of dust\nlay piled up around the stake. It was enough. I slammed the lid shut.\n\n\n\nLooking back now, I can see it was all for the best. Ria was\ndifferent--apart from other women. A dreamer, a mystic, too easily\ninfluenced by the bizarre and un-normal. I, on the other hand, am\npractical almost to a fault. Had she married me I might have crushed in\nher the very thing that drew me to her. In time she might have grown to\nhate me.\n\nHunter, on the other hand, was a student. Introspective, given to\nromanticizing. Susceptible to suggestion. Had I been confronted with an\nEve, I should have run like hell. To him, though, she was cloaked in\nmystery; hence, more desirable. What better choice for him ultimately\nthan Ria? That Ria had to die to achieve her happiness is of no real\nimportance. Life is a transitory thing anyway.\n\nSometimes, though, when I look at Ria's picture, it's hard to be\npractical. She was everything I shall ever want.\n\nI had never been to Europe before the summer of 1947. I went to find\nMaria, to marry her. Instead, I found and murdered her, and I will never\ngo back again.\n\n\n\n\n",
