    "body": "\"What time did you get to bed last night?\"\n\n\"Oh, about ... well, fairly early.\"\n\n\"Who were you out with?\"\n\n\"Brannan.\"\n\n\"Then you didn't get to bed early! If you got in by three, it would be\nearly, if I know Brannan.\"\n\n\"I got in _much_ before three!\"\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"Oh ... enough. You'd be surprised....\"\n\n\"I'm sure I would! Mary, how do you expect us to get anywhere with this\nexperiment if you come in dog-tired?\"\n\n\"Donald Jensen, I'm not dog-tired. It's _you_ who's got me in bed in\nthe wee hours, not me! I came in early.\"\n\n\"Then why won't you state the exact time?\" he was exasperated.\n\nShe smiled at him archly. \"I don't remember, exactly.\"\n\n\"You don't seem to have much of a memory for anything when it comes to\nBrannan. What you see in a guy like that, I don't know.\"\n\n\"What's wrong with him?\"\n\n\"Not a thing. He's a nice guy. Quiet, respectable, deep--and only one\nthing on his mind.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nHe glared at her. \"You're a smart girl,\" he said. \"You work with me in\nthis laboratory eight hours a day. You are engaged in a very complex\nexperiment with the human brain, registering its waves and emanations\nin relation to thought, emotions and purely psychological relations.\nYou've got a degree in psychology, another in psychiatry, a third in\nbiology. You have written several advanced papers on the functions of\nthe subconscious mind and its effect on the conscious mind. You have\nkept this job for three years, exacting as it is. You're a _brilliant_\ngirl. And yet you can ask a stupid question like that!\"\n\nShe smiled at him even more brightly. \"What's stupid about it?\"\n\nHe stared at her, then suddenly grinned back. \"Okay, you're ribbing me.\nBut dammit, you let a guy like Brannan soft-soap you and squire you\nall around the town, and eat it up, and when I pay you a legitimate\ncompliment, you act like ... like a _woman_!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Mr. Jensen, sir,\" she said. \"I didn't mean to forget we are\nworking in a scientific laboratory and that you are my boss. We are\nboth men, working on a man's job--\"\n\nHe groaned. \"Okay, you win. But will you quit rubbing in that silly\nstatement I made when I hired you? Sure, I said it was a man's job,\nand I wanted it handled like a man. But you needn't grow a beard over\nit!\"\n\n\"Might be a good idea. Then when you fire me for being dog-tired, I\ncould get a job in a circus.\"\n\n\"Yes, and if you bungle this morning's experiment, _I_ may be able to\nget a job in a nuthouse!\"\n\nShe was instantly contrite. \"Oh Don, I won't! But why don't you do the\nhard work, and let me be the subject? Then if anything goes wrong, all\nyour work won't be lost....\"\n\n\"Nuts. You know as much about it as I do. And besides, what if I\naccidentally picked up your emotional seat and found out what time\nBrannan _really_ brought you in last night?\"\n\n\"Maybe you'd be surprised.\"\n\n\"I'd like to have Brannan under the machine,\" he said. \"Maybe _you'd_\nbe surprised.\"\n\n\"Mary Mason can take care of herself,\" she said.\n\nHe looked at her. \"Yeah, I guess you _can_. So, how about dinner\ntonight?\"\n\n\"Psychology class tonight.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow night.\"\n\n\"Choir practice.\"\n\n\"Thursday.\"\n\n\"Brannan.\"\n\n\"Friday.\"\n\n\"Washing and ironing.\"\n\n\"Saturday and Sunday.\"\n\n\"My days off.\"\n\n\"Then do you mind if we get to work?\"\n\n\"That's what you hired me for.\"\n\nHe bent over his machine and uttered something in a muffled voice.\n\n\"What did you say?\" she asked innocently.\n\n\"I wouldn't repeat it for a lady's ears,\" he snapped.\n\n\n\n\"The pineal gland--the mystery gland of the human brain. Mystics call\nit the 'third eye.' Some say it is an atrophied eye, in the center of\nthe forehead, others say it is a new sense man is developing, for use\nin the future.\"\n\n\"Shut up and let me put this electrode in place,\" said Mary. She\nswabbed at his forehead with a piece of cotton dipped in alcohol. Then\nshe placed a small pad of felt dipped in water over the spot, and\nplaced the silver electrode over it, clamped it in place on his head.\n\nHe grinned up at her. \"Maybe when you turn on the power, and amplify\nthe waves, I'll be able to read your mind.\"\n\n\"You'd better not. Unless you want me to quit and go home to San\nFrancisco.\"\n\n\"What's the matter? Afraid to let anyone know what you're thinking?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said firmly. \"I just think my thoughts are private, that's\nall.\"\n\n\"Then what are you working on this thing with me for?\"\n\n\"We're measuring brain waves, charting patterns, recording reactions.\nAll this stuff about mind-reading is purely imagination. If that's what\nyou're working toward, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed.\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"Got the oscilloscope hooked up?\"\n\n\"Yes. And also the television screen and the camera. It'll amplify\nthe wave patterns and project them ... and in your case I'm convinced\nthey'll all be....\"\n\n\"Don't say it,\" he said hastily. \"I don't need to read your brain waves\nto know what you're thinking.\"\n\n\"Nor do I need this machine to know what you are usually thinking of,\"\nshe finished. \"Now lie down and relax. I'm going to give you the lowest\nvoltage first. I still don't think you are right in saying there's no\nreal danger.\"\n\nHe lay back and closed his eyes.\n\nSwiftly she went about, making adjustments, turning rheostats, watching\nindications on meters with narrowed eyes. Then, with a final check over\nthe entire apparatus, she switched on the machine to lowest voltage.\n\nSlowly the tubes warmed up, then there came a slight crackling from\nthe loudspeaker, developing swiftly into a hum that rose and fell\nin a musical pattern. The green bands on the oscilloscope danced in\ntime to the hum from the loudspeaker, and on the television screen\nan image began to form. By stages it grew, at first seeming to be a\nwavering white pillar, then a ghostly form, like a sheeted figure in a\ngraveyard, then suddenly it began to clarify. A face emerged into view,\nand Mary almost gasped as she recognized it as her own. But the rest of\nthe picture remained shadowy and indistinct.\n\n\"More power,\" murmured Mary. She turned the rheostat up a trifle\nfurther, and the hum from the loudspeaker became even louder, more\nvibrant. On the screen the rest of the dancing figure coalesced and\nsuddenly Mary jumped back from the screen. She turned toward Jensen\nwhere he lay, relaxing with a slight smile on his face, and uttered an\nexclamation.\n\n\"Don, you stop that!\" She reached for the electrode to snatch it\nindignantly from his head. As she did so her fingers touched the\nmetal. A bright flash came from the silver disk, raced up her arm, and\nher muscles tightened in shock. Her voice rose suddenly in a scream,\nand then, as Jensen jerked violently under her hands, everything\nwent black. She slumped beside him, unconscious, and the hum from\nthe loudspeaker took on a higher, treble note that filled the whole\nlaboratory with its vibrant pulsations.\n\n\n\nHigh over the valley came a keening note, drifting down the wind with a\nstrange, heterodyning effect. It rose and fell with a definite cadence,\nas though it were a message.\n\nOut of the murky darkness at the far end came a stirring; a gigantic\ngroping, as of a monstrous something responding sluggishly to the\ncall. Then, more swiftly, getting its bearings, the shadowed something\nbegan moving forward, gaining purpose, gaining massiveness, gaining\nspeed. There was almost an anxious eagerness in its progress, as though\nit were an appetite sensing a free meal. At the same time there was\nsomething obscene in its haste, as though it anticipated more than\nmere food.\n\nHigh on the south wall of the valley, atop the ramparts of the City,\nstood a figure in a red cloak, staring out over the valley's dark\ndepths. He was tall, saturnine, and his face, though darkly handsome,\nwas somehow malevolent, menacing, revolting. He was leering now, in\nghastly anticipation of something that was to occur at the base of the\ncliffs at his feet. Behind him the keening of the Call still emanated\nfrom the lips of the gory idol enthroned in the Temple. He shook a fist\nat the darkness below.\n\n\"Feel now the dire might of the anger of Bra Naan!\" he mouthed. \"Die,\nDahnjen Saan, despoiler of the Temple!\" He turned to an accolyte.\n\"Control the Beast, when he comes. Let him kill, but save the\nPriestess. Her punishment shall be mine alone.\" He licked his lips.\n\n\"Yes, Oh High One. The Beast shall move only as the Hypno-ray\ndictates.\" The accolyte hurried off into the Temple and in a moment,\nlancing down from above, came the beam of the ray, searching into the\ndepths of the valley.\n\n\n\nThe Priestess Marima Saan no longer struggled in Dahnjen Saan's\ngrasp, as he carried her amid the gloomy ramparts of the weird stone\nformations on the valley floor. Instead she wept, and clung to him.\n\n\"Why do you weep?\" he asked harshly.\n\n\"Because now we both will die,\" she said. \"Oh Dahnjen, why did you do\nit?\"\n\n\"Because I do not propose that Bra Naan will remain forever as a\nbarrier to our love,\" he said. \"Beyond the Valley his power does not\nexist. We are going there to live our lives as they should be lived.\"\n\n\"Alone, in the Wild Land?\"\n\nHe laughed. \"It's not so wild as you think. I've been there. And\nnothing so fearsome exists that we cannot overcome it. Nor will anyone\never find us. The natives are friendly--I know them well.\"\n\nOnce more she began to weep. \"But we'll never get there. We cannot\nescape from the Valley. It is guarded at the exit by the Beast. None\nhave ever escaped him.\"\n\nDahnjen patted the rifle strapped to his back. \"Think you that the\nPriests alone know anything of science?\" he asked.\n\nShe looked at the long barrel of the rifle. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"Something the Beast will not like,\" he promised. \"And now, be still.\nSoon we will be on more level ground, and you will be able to walk.\"\n\nSome minutes later he set her down, and she walked by his side. But as\nthey moved deeper into the Valley, and into the gloom, a sound began\nbehind them. It was a keening noise, shrill, penetrating, rising and\nfalling with the chill of terror in its pitch.\n\n\"The Call!\" cried Marima Saan. \"Bra Naan calls the Beast! Now we shall\nsurely die!\" She clung to him.\n\nHe urged her forward again, looking swiftly about him as they went.\nFinally he spied the rock formation he wanted, and together they\ncrouched in its shadow, waiting. Above them, lancing through the dark\nmists came the ray from atop the cliff. Dahnjen growled. \"He wants to\nmake sure--he's using the Hypno-ray. Good thing it only works on the\nBeast!\"\n\nAhead of them now they heard sounds. Huge thumping sounds,\nearth-shaking motions as a monstrous body moved toward them in the\ndarkness.\n\n\"The Beast comes!\" said Marima tragically. \"Oh Dahnjen, what shall we\ndo?\" She flung her arms around his neck and clung to him. \"Is this the\nway our love will end?\"\n\nHe bent his head and kissed her, then he grinned at her. \"In just a\nmoment you will learn more about that,\" he said. \"But right now, you\ncrouch down behind me and stay there. As soon as I can see, you'll find\nout that not only the Priests are possessed of wonderful instruments.\"\nHe slipped the rifle from his shoulder and held it ready in his hands.\n\nThe searching ray swept over them several times, and the third pass\nfound them. Momentarily it outlined them in its light, then swept on,\nas though in disdain. Finally it halted, down the valley, centered on a\nlumbering form, outlining it in the darkness so that its head could be\nseen looming high above the ground.\n\n\"The Beast!\" breathed Marima.\n\nAnd now, moving more purposefully, heading straight toward them, the\nmonster came. Although they knew that it could not see them as yet, in\nthe darkness, it did not deviate from its course, and they know that\nits feeble mind was under the control of the priests in the Temple far\nabove them on the cliff wall. As it came, its jowls slavered, and its\neyes glared ferociously. The light gleamed off its bared teeth, and\nreflected from the scaly ugliness of its hide.\n\nDahnjen Saan lifted his newly invented weapon, sighted carefully.\nThen as Marima Saan cringed back in terror, a sharp explosion echoed\nand re-echoed in the confines of the valley. A brilliant flash of\nlight illuminated the scene for a moment, and then a second explosion\ncame from the neck of the Beast. It faltered, uttered a tremendous\nroar of rage and pain, and blood gouted from its wound. Then roaring\ncontinuously, it charged forward once more. Again and again Dahnjen\nfired his rifle, and each time explosions shook the valley and jarred\nthe oncoming monster. First one eye, then the other vanished in a\nshredding of gore, and then the mouth literally exploded, and the\nbrilliant white of the bared teeth vanished in red blood.\n\nThe monster stopped, stood swaying, then came on again, but it was\nobvious that it had been seriously wounded, and was not guiding its own\nmovements. Its giant head was turned sideways in an awkward stiffness,\nexposing its ear. Dahnjen aimed a shot directly into it, and the top of\nthe head seemed to disintegrate. Brains flew through the air, mingled\nwith red, and the monster halted again. For long moments it swayed,\nthen with a crash that shook the rock beside which the two fugitives\ncrouched, it collapsed to the floor of the valley and lay kicking\ngigantically, thrashing about in monstrous death throes.\n\n\"Dahnjen!\" screamed Marima. \"You've killed the Beast!\"\n\nHe shouldered his rifle and lifted her to her feet. Then he bent and\nkissed her again. \"It was what I had in mind,\" he admitted.\n\n\n\nBefore them lay the narrow entrance to the Valley's lower end. Beyond\nthe gap they saw blue sky and the rolling green of a forest.\n\n\"There,\" said Dahnjen, \"lies our freedom. Once in the depths of that\nforest, we will be safe. Hundreds of miles away lies a land where the\npower of the priests does not reach.\"\n\nMarima clasped his hand in hers and they both hastened forward.\n\nBut suddenly, across the narrow gap before them, rose a dozen red-robed\nfigures. In the fore was the menacing form of Bra Naan. Leveled at them\nwas the deadly crossbow of the Priesthood.\n\nMarima uttered a cry of horror and leaped forward, placing her body\nbetween that of Bra Naan and Dahnjen. There was a sharp twang of a\nbowstring, and the arrow leaped from the priest's crossbow to bury\nitself in her breast. With a scream she sank to the ground. But as she\ndid so Dahnjen recovered from his frozen surprise and whipped his\nrifle from his shoulder. Crouching behind her fallen body, he leveled\nit and pressed the trigger. Bra Naan's head exploded on his shoulders\nand disintegrated. He fell to the ground. And as he did so, the\nremaining priests charged forward. Methodically, cursing and sobbing,\nDahnjen shot them, one by one, and as the last two reached him, he\nclubbed the rifle and swung it savagely about his head. There came a\nsatisfying crunch as the skull of the man in the lead cracked, and then\nthe last man was upon him. Dahnjen brought the stock of the rifle up\nunder the man's chin and almost drove it through his skull. Then, the\nbattle over, he stood there, swaying. Eyes glazing, he dropped to his\nknees and sagged over the body of Marima Saan....\n\n\n\nMary Mason opened her eyes in bewilderment and looked up at Don Jensen\nbending over her. On his forehead the silver electrode was still\nstrapped, but broken wires dangled from it, over one ear.\n\n\"What happened?\" she asked.\n\n\"I don't exactly know,\" he said. \"But I do know you suddenly dashed\nover and clouted me in the face. Then everything went black for what\nI judge was quite a period of time. I must have fallen off the couch,\nfinally, and broken the wires, which stopped the machine. Anyway, I\ncame to to find you lying beside me on the floor. Whatever was the idea\nof bashing me?\"\n\nA flood of red suddenly rose to her cheeks. \"Now I remember,\" she\nsaid. \"It was what you were thinking! It was on the screen!\"\n\nIt was his turn to redden. \"What was on the screen?\"\n\n\"You know very well.\" She got to her feet, went over to the television\nscreen and looked into it. It was blank.\n\nHe followed her over, removing the electrode from his forehead. He\ntossed it on the bench and looked at the clock. \"Twenty minutes,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Twenty minutes what?\" she asked.\n\n\"We were both out twenty minutes, and all the time the machine was\nrunning. So, whatever was recorded, the only evidence we'll have is the\ncamera. Might as well run it back and see what you missed.\"\n\nShe stiffened. \"Lord knows what's on it. If what you started out with\nis any criterion.\"\n\nHe grinned at her. \"It's _my_ thoughts, not yours, which are going to\nbe exposed to the public, in this case you,\" he said. \"And while I\ndevelop the film, I suggest you powder up a bit. You look a bit wan and\ntired....\"\n\n\"Before I do,\" she said, \"I want to warn you.\"\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\"It wasn't just lines and patterns and lights on the screen. It was\nactual pictures.\"\n\nHe gaped at her. \"_Pictures!_\"\n\n\"Yes. And it means at least one of the results of our experiments are\ngoing to be sensational. The pineal gland may be the answer to perfect\npsychiatric diagnosis, because it seems that it translates the brain\nwaves into actual pictures.\"\n\n\"The pineal gland--an eye in reverse!\" he gasped.\n\n\"Exactly. And now, I'll leave you. And if you don't care to show me\nthese particular pictures, I'll....\"\n\n\"Judging from what I was thinking initially, it's going to be a\npleasure!\" he said.\n\nShe swept furiously from the room.\n\n\n\nTwo hours later he seated her before the projection screen and went\nback to the projector.\n\n\"If you're sure this isn't going to embarrass you....\" she began.\n\n\"It won't,\" he assured her. \"I haven't seen any of it yet, except a few\ninteresting glimpses I caught in the darkroom. But if you look like\nsome of the things I saw....\"\n\n\"Just what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Wait and see.\" He switched on the projector and came back to sit down\nbeside her.\n\nAs the first picture appeared on the screen, only an indistinct white\npillar was visible. It swirled, thickened, grew more distinct. A face\nappeared. \"It's you,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"And then I turned up the power to bring the image up\nstronger.\"\n\nThe image on the screen clarified. He drew a long breath. \"Nice!\" he\nbreathed. \"And I gather that's where you socked me?\"\n\n\"Don't you think I should have? Is that all you've ever got in your\nhead....\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" he said in a strained voice. \"There's more of what's\nin my head, apparently. But I swear I never saw any of _that_ before!\"\n\nThe two watched in amazement as the dim confines of the weird valley\nflashed on the screen. They saw the shadowy bulk of the monster moving\nabout. Then abruptly the scene changed, and Mary gasped.\n\n\"Brannan!\" she choked. \"But how evil he looks!\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know.... That's the way I picture him....\"\n\n\"In a long cloak?\" she asked.\n\n\"And with a dagger,\" he agreed.\n\nNow Mary gasped again. \"It's you--carrying me down a cliff!\"\n\n\"Regular Batman, ain't I?\"\n\nShe snorted. And snorted again as the film reached the point where she\nthrew her arms around his neck and received his kiss.\n\n\"You don't like that?\" he asked.\n\nShe tossed her head, but didn't reply. Her eyes were intent on the\nscreen. Suddenly she snickered. \"Look at you!\" she exclaimed. \"You'd\nthink you were preparing to protect me from the Devil, or something,\nthe way you push me behind that rock and get ready with your gun.\nWhat's coming next--Indians?\"\n\n\"Better than that,\" he said drily. \"If that's an Indian, I'm a pop\nbottle cork....\"\n\nShe screamed involuntarily, then caught herself. \"What a foul looking\nbeast,\" she said. \"So that's what you have in your mind!\"\n\n\"Looks like I don't intend to keep him there,\" he remarked. He watched\nwith interest as his shots took effect on the monster and it crashed to\nthe valley floor. \"Too bad we don't have sound effects.\"\n\nNow she began to shout with laughter. \"Kissing again!\" she said, \"The\nhero has slain the dragon, and even while he stands beside its kicking\ncorpse, he embraces the fair maiden. Ye Gods, Don, is that the _brain_\nI'm working for? You _really_ need a psychiatrist!\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked angrily.\n\n\"Why, it's all so obvious. Here you are, carrying a torch for me,\nand taking out your frustration in comic-book daydreams. And the\nprotagonist in your dream is poor Brannan, of whom you are obviously\njealous. Why, Brannan doesn't mean a thing to me! So, here you are,\nrescuing me--or stealing me--from the evil Brannan, and slaying the\ndragon he sends out to kill us both, and proceeding on your merry way\ntoward a happily-ever-after ending. See, there's the Garden of Eden at\nthe end of the dark valley....\"\n\n\"And there's Brannan again, to foul up the works,\" said Jensen. \"Looks\nlike my daydreams aren't exactly logical....\"\n\nBut he, too, stopped in sudden horror as the film ground on and showed\nMary leaping to her death to save him from the priest's arrow. Neither\nof them said a word as the wild battle that followed was enacted\nbefore them, to the final scene. They watched his body topple down and\nthe screen go blank, then he got up and snapped off the projector and\nturned up the lights.\n\n\"If you ask me,\" he said, \"those last weren't _my_ thoughts. And if\nI remember rightly, when I came to, your hand was still clutching\nthe wires to the machine. Also, I'm hanged if I'd ever even _dream_\nof you being killed. I'd have mopped up on that gang and borne you\ntriumphantly to a leafy bower and....\"\n\n\"... and what?\" she said faintly.\n\n\"We've got a wonderful thing here,\" he said. \"A tremendous method of\npsychiatric diagnoses. We can project every desire, every frustration,\nevery concealed emotion, directly on a screen, and see with our own\neyes exactly what is bothering the subconscious of the patient. We can\nsee exactly what they _really_ want. What they _really_ feel. Like....\"\n\n\"... like what?\" she asked again.\n\nHe bent and kissed her. \"How would you like to raise a flock of our\nkids, while I make a lot of money plowing up the subconscious corn in\nother people?\"\n\n\"I'd have agreed long ago, if you'd asked me,\" she said.\n\n\"I'd have asked long ago, if you hadn't kept on going out with\nBrannan,\" he retorted.\n\n\"What do you think I went out with him for!\"\n\nHe stood nonplussed for a moment, then he grinned. \"Maybe we better\nstrap on the electrodes again,\" he said. \"There's a lot of corn left in\nboth of us!\"\n\n\n\n\n",
