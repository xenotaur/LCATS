    "body": "The first time I met Joe Galloway after he married, I envied him. A\nfriendly, good-natured envy, you understand. He had attained what\nlooked to me like genuine success; he had got somewhere, both in a\nmaterial and spiritual way. He had a connection that gave him income\nsufficient for his needs, sufficient to maintain a decent standard of\nliving, and a substantial interest in the business besides, which was\nslowly but surely building up a competence for him. He had his little\ncircle of friends, and his home. And he was mated to a woman any man\nmight be proud of. I could not see anything a man really craves that\nwas beyond his reach.\n\nI\u2019ve not had what you\u2019d call a multifarious experience in the way of\nmarried folk, but I haven\u2019t gone through the world blind. I have seen\na lot that lived the proverbial cat-and-dog existence. I\u2019ve seen a lot\nmore that lived in a state of more or less tolerant indifference. And\nI have seen a few that appeared to have a corner on confidence and\naffection and genuine understanding, to be really mated, in the widest\nmeaning of the term. Galloway and his wife seemed to me to be one of\nthe finest examples of the latter that I\u2019d ever come across. Joe was a\nreal man, sterling. If one may know a woman by her ordinary manner,\nthen Norma rang as true as he did. And she was a beautiful woman, too;\none of those tall, perfectly formed, radiant creatures that a man is\nproud to be seen walking down the street with.\n\nI\u2019d gone to school with Joe Galloway, but I had seen nothing of him\nfor many a long moon, until I ran across him quite by accident on a\ntrip East. We had been chummy kids, and we had drifted apart because\nJoe was one of those quiet beggars that knows what he wants and stays\neverlastingly on the trail of his purposes\u2014and I\u2019m a rolling stone, a\nfull-fledged brother in the order of the wandering foot. But time and\ndistance made scant difference. He had a warm recollection of me, and\nhe insisted that I make his home my headquarters. I did, and spent\nnearly three weeks with them. They made me feel one with\nthemselves\u2014and, as I said, I envied them in their happiness. If they\nwere not happy and contented, there is no such satisfying state of\nmind.\n\nI came back to the coast in due time, and while I didn\u2019t write,\nbecause I\u2019m not much on correspondence, I did retain some very vivid\nimpressions of Joe and Norma Galloway. I liked to think of them like a\npair of birds in their nest, while I was knocking about in logging\ncamps, with bolt cutters and all the roving, restless lot my way of\nlife took me among. A man playing a lone hand finds his life full of\nbleak spots. He can\u2019t dodge them. And I suppose I thought of those two\noften because their lives seemed full of desirable things which had\neluded me. As I saw it, they had attained as near to the ideal as we\ncan ever reasonably expect to come.\n\nSo you can judge of my surprise and know that I was filled with deep\nwonder and kindred emotions when I came out on the wharf at Coderre\nLanding just as a tubby coaster backed away, and plumped into Joe\nGalloway sitting on a war bag, dressed in mackinaws and calked boots\nlike any logger. I\u2019d never seen him in such garb. I hadn\u2019t seen him at\nall in four years, and he had a week\u2019s growth of beard\u2014but I knew him.\nAnd I knew by the way his eyes widened and then narrowed that he knew\nme. I spoke to him. For a second I thought he meant to refuse\nrecognition. Then he stuck out his hand.\n\n\u201cHello, Steve!\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a long time since we met.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is, and I sure never expected to meet you here,\u201d I blurted out.\n\nHis face darkened a trifle.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he answered slowly, \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you did. Still\u2014I\u2019m in a\nlogging country, dressed like a logger. In fact, I am a logger. Do I\nlook the part?\u201d\n\nI had to admit that he did, although I had no idea what he was driving\nat.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a friend of mine, aren\u2019t you, Steve?\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cI certainly am,\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d he continued, in a weary sort of tone, \u201cjust take me for\ngranted. I\u2019m here, going to work in a shingle-bolt camp. I\u2019m a\nwoodsman, and my name is Joe Hall. Just remember that, and don\u2019t ask\nme how it comes to be that way. Will you? I\u2019m here, but I don\u2019t know\nhow long I\u2019ll be here, nor where I\u2019ll be headed when I leave. And I\ndon\u2019t want to be reminded that I was ever anything else, or that\nthings were ever any different.\u201d\n\nOf course, I told him I would meet him halfway on that proposition,\nand we went up to the Coderre Hotel and had a drink, Joe packing his\nwar bag over his shoulder, as if he had done it all the days of his\nlife. We talked more or less perfunctorily, haltingly, dodging\nconsciously old days and old themes. I found out that he was bound for\nthe bolt camp under whose owner I myself held a five-hundred-cord\ncontract. He seemed a little glad of that, and asked me a lot about my\ncamp and prospects. Then, after a little, he asked the way to Ryder\u2019s.\nI showed him, and he started out. I wanted him to wait an hour or so\ntill I got my business transacted, but he seemed anxious to get on,\nand I didn\u2019t urge my company upon him.\n\nAnd I watched him hike off down an old skid road that led to Ryder\u2019s\ncamp at Skeleton Point, wondering. Naturally I wondered. When a man\nsloughs everything that makes life worth while and turns up at the\nhardest job on the Pacific coast with a different name, and something\nhard and bitter in his eyes, there\u2019s something radically wrong. I\ndidn\u2019t ask him what it was. I had no intention of asking, of prying\ninto his affairs merely to satisfy my own very human curiosity. In the\nlanguage of the undertaker, it was his funeral. But I wondered. I\nsurely did. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d committed any crime. He didn\u2019t act\nlike a fugitive. He seemed to me more like a man who had come some\nterrible cropper and lost all heart for everything. And it must have\nbeen something sinister and very sweeping, for he wasn\u2019t the sort of\nman who lets go easily.\n\nWhat I saw of him afterward only confirmed those first impressions. He\nstuck at the Ryder job, and he used to come down to my camp every few\ndays and play crib with me in the evening. There wasn\u2019t much of the\nold life in him. Not that he was wearied with the work, because he was\na powerful man. Whatever ailed him in his soul, his body hadn\u2019t\nsuffered. I\u2019ve lived in the open most of my life, doing things that\ntake endurance and muscle, and he was physically a better man than I.\nBut where he used to sparkle, to be full of the devil, now he would\nsit around quietly, always immersed in his own thoughts, an absent\nlook stealing over his face if he were left long to himself. And he\nnever spoke of anything east of the Rockies, although the coast States\nseemed like a well-read book to him. So far as speech and actions\nwent, the first thirty years of his life that I knew directly and\nindirectly seemed to have been blotted out. He never talked about it,\nand I dare say he didn\u2019t even want to think about it.\n\nThings ran along like this for a month or so. Joe mentioned at last\nthat Ryder was giving the men rotten grub. I put in my oar at that. I\nhad a contract under Ryder, but we hadn\u2019t much use for each other\u2014and\nI was short-handed, too.\n\n\u201cYou come down here and cut bolts for me,\u201d I proposed. \u201cI can\u2019t pay\nmore per cord than Ryder does, but I\u2019ll guarantee you better food.\u201d\n\nHe considered this a minute.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d he said indifferently. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a change, anyway.\u201d\n\nHe landed in my camp at ten the next morning and went to work. I can\u2019t\nsay that we got any closer for all that we worked in sight of each\nother by day and slept under the same roof in the same room at night.\nJoe remained a silent, preoccupied man. But he had decent food to eat,\nand I had an efficient shingle-bolt cutter, and, in addition, an able\ncrib player to pass the lonely evenings.\n\nI don\u2019t know why, but I felt sorry for him. There was nothing concrete\nin his speech or action to arouse that feeling. It was just an\natmosphere, one that I should likely never have sensed if I hadn\u2019t\nknown him under different circumstances. I couldn\u2019t get it out of my\nhead that the man had suffered, was still suffering, still being\nseared by some inner fire. It isn\u2019t natural for a man of that type to\ncut loose from everything and everybody. He never got a letter, never\nseemed to expect one, never wrote one. He didn\u2019t seem to have any care\nfor the future, any ambition. He lived from one day to another, just\nputting in the day. It seemed to satisfy him. But it didn\u2019t satisfy\nme. It didn\u2019t seem natural.\n\nWhen he had been with me about six weeks we began to get some bad\nsummer winds on the gulf. Skeleton Point lies just at the entrance to\none of the worst tidal passages on the whole North Pacific. The\nthirty-odd miles of the gulf\u2019s width is pinched to a pair of half-mile\nnarrows\u2014one against Vancouver Island, one on the mainland side, where\nmy camp stood. Through this pent channel the tides come and go with\ndevilish ferocity. Woe to the small craft caught therein at the full\nrun either way. Even the powerful coasters lie up for the slack of the\ntide, for few have power to buck that tide race, and if they run with\nit, the danger is little less. Reef and point thrust out from the\nclosing shores to fling the headlong current this way and that in\ngreat whirls that will suck down a sixty-foot timber as if it were a\nmatch. The rivers of the Western watershed have their \u201chell gates\u201d\u2014but\nthat gateway of the sea which I speak of, leading through narrow\nreaches to the open water of Queen Charlotte Sound, is the true gate\nto hell for those who take it otherwise than at slack water.\n\nThis snarling trap for mariners rose to the zenith of its fury a few\nhundred yards past the lagoon in which I boomed my shingle bolts for\nRyder. Snarling rips lifted their torn crests offshore from my cabin,\nwhen the ebb run met the gulf swell. And just within Skeleton Point\nwhere the pent channel widened suddenly, beginning there and extending\nits circumference past my lagoon, there swirled and circled\nceaselessly\u2014save for a brief hour at slack water\u2014a huge back eddy, in\nwhich sailed around and around all the driftwood and flotsam spewed\nthrough Hell Gate or brought to its door by ebb and flood. Round in\nits circle the gray-green water swept, swifter and more swift, until\nat full run in or out it raced, and a hollow whirlpool spun in the\ncenter like a top.\n\nAbout three weeks after Joe came to work for me, we sat at dinner one\nday. Low tide came at one-thirty\u2014the end of a big flood. It had become\nmy habit to watch those tides. The tremendous inrushings and\noutpourings fascinated me. And I, like other men, had seen strange and\nfearful things happen there. Once, indeed, the foolhardy skipper of a\ncoastwise boat, with ninety lives under his hand, tried to buck\nthrough Hell Gate. He had a sixteen-knot-boat contempt for fast water,\nand a schedule of gulf ports to make. He fought tide and whirl and rip\nand eddy till he laid Skeleton Point abeam. There his headway was no\nmore than the race of the stream, and while he quivered and lurched a\ngreat swirl caught and swung him hard on the point, crushing the steel\nskin of his ship like so much cardboard\u2014and of the ninety, only a\ndozen clawed desperately ashore. I saw that. I saw, too, a thirty-foot\nfishing boat go down by the nose in a whirlpool, go down and down till\nthe water closed over her, to be shot afloat, keel up, ten minutes\nlater, her crew of three drowned like rats in the pilot house. In no\nspirit of irony was that grim spot called Hell Gate.\n\nAs I said, we sat at our food, three of us. I gazed at the water\nfoaming by the point, and saw nothing but the racing tide. A second\nlater, with my eyes on my plate, Joe startled me with the vehemence of\nhis exclamation:\n\n\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, look at that!\u201d\n\nI picked the boat up at a glance, and knew that in the moment of my\ninattention the tide had vomited her out of Hell Gate and past the\nblack teeth of Skeleton Point. But she was in hard case, helpless in\nthat terrible sweep, lurching heavily down to her sheer strake. Thus\nshe would lie canted on her side half a minute on end. Then she would\nstraighten loggily. Again she would spin in the grip of a whirl, a\nmasterless craft, at the whimsical mercy of the sea. I knew that by\nthe way she yawed and spun, and the silence of her\u2014no chatter of\nengine, nor dull popping of exhaust. Her power plant was dead. She was\nabout a forty-footer, of the work-boat type. As for her crew\u2014one man\nstood by the stumpy signal mast, and that was all I saw. He waved a\nhand to us airily, as if it were all in the day\u2019s work, that sickening\nlurch, that uncontrollable spinning in the swirls.\n\nWe were all outside on the bank by then, my third man, Joe, and\nmyself. I squinted seaward and saw very near at hand the tide rips\ntumbling in a rising gulf swell.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one chance for him on God\u2019s green earth,\u201d said I. \u201cIf he\ngoes into those rips without steerageway\u2014good night. If the back eddy\ncatches him, we might heave him a line as she swings past. Come on!\u201d\n\nPast the mouth of the lagoon, a low cliff gave straight down on the\neddy\u2019s sweep, and I had often noticed that driftwood making its\ninterminable round passed under the cliff. At the end of my cabin hung\na coil of half-inch rope. This I took hurriedly, and a link from a\nboom chain weighing perhaps half a pound for a weight whereby to cast\nthe line. Skirting the lagoon, we three came to the cliff and stood by\nto watch, I knotting fast the weight. And by the turn of chance or the\nhand of Destiny, the back eddy caught him in the nick of time.\n\nAs he swung out of the seaward stream into the eddy and turning from\nthose ominous rips began his swift circle inshore and toward us, I\nknew that his chance was small if we failed to reach him on the first\nor second turn.\n\nI knew his trouble by the boat\u2019s loggy swing. Without power to give\nher steerageway, she had swept through Hell Gate, taking water by the\nbarrel, escaping destruction against cliff and reef only by some\nmiracle of the sea. But she rode deep, and listed heavily now to\nstarboard, now to port, as if all weary of the struggle. Her buoyancy\nwas gone. If she circled in the eddy till she drew to its center that\nspinning whirl would suck her down.\n\n\u201cGive me the line!\u201d Joe said, as she shot down toward us.\n\nIt was the first word he had spoken, and with it there shone in his\neyes such a gleam of resolve as I had never surprised there\u2014as if\nbefore a fellow being\u2019s peril his own embittered soul had cast off its\nlassitude, had fired with the human instinct to do, to help, to save.\n\nHe swung the link on the rope\u2019s end as a sling-shot thrower whirls his\nmissile, and as the boat\u2014now showing the name _Grosbeak_ in bold white\nagainst her black bow\u2014came abreast, he shot the line with a tremendous\nheave of his body. I could not have cast it as far by forty feet, I\nknow. But the throw failed. It was scarce in a man\u2019s arm to bridge the\ndistance. The speed of the current helped to fool him besides. The\nline fell short, and to the rear.\n\n\u201cHaul in!\u201d Joe panted. \u201cHaul fast!\u201d\n\nI hauled, and as I hauled he threw off his clothes, his heavy boots,\nand catching the loose end of the line, knotted it about his breast\nunder the armpits.\n\n\u201cAhoy, you!\u201d he yelled. We were running now along the bank to keep\nabreast. \u201cSwim for it. I\u2019ll meet you with the line.\u201d\n\nIt was a desperate chance for both of them. But the man leaning\nagainst the pilot house threw off shoes and cap, and, running aft,\npoised lightly on the stern. Then he waved a hand and plunged\nheadfirst, rose, and faced cliff-ward, borne swiftly along on the\neddy, but swimming with slow, vigorous strokes. Galloway\u2014or Hall, as\nhe wished to be known\u2014sprinted along the cliff and gained some headway\non the swimmer.\n\n\u201cPay out!\u201d he gritted. \u201cAnd keep along with the current if you can.\u201d\n\nThen he plunged, thirty feet to the gray-green sweep of the eddy.\n\nIt was a great fight, with us two helpless watchers and every chance\nagainst that hardy soul from the _Grosbeak_. With a line on Joe, we\ncould haul him in. The other had to reach him or drown. And it seemed\nto me and my bolt cutter that he lost ground, that the eddy carried\nhim out for all the power of his stroke. But we told each other that\nif he could hold his own Joe would get him.\n\nAnd he did. With a scant fathom of line left in my hands, and the\n_Grosbeak_ man fast weakening, they met. I saw Joe grip him, and saw\nhim relax in that grip. Then we hauled them in and lifted them out on\na flat rock, both near gone\u2014for the pull of the rope against the drag\nof the tide held them under half the time.\n\nThe man was conscious, but utterly exhausted, too spent to speak. He\nlay on his side, breast heaving, hair in clammy strands across his\nbrow. A good-looking, clean-built chap of thirty, maybe. All he had on\nhim was a thin undershirt and a pair of cotton overalls. Their damp\ncling threw into clean contours the depth of his chest and the ropy\nmuscle of his arms. His face was almost boyish. He lay there panting,\nblinking up at me. Slowly a wry grin, an odd expression for one who\nhad been near to death, stole across his face.\n\nHe sat up and looked at the _Grosbeak_, now on her second swing,\ndrawing fatefully near to the vortex.\n\n\u201cI wonder if she\u2019ll make it?\u201d he murmured indifferently.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about a hundred to one that she won\u2019t,\u201d I answered.\n\nHe looked at Joe appraisingly.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re all right,\u201d said he, \u201cto take a long chance like that for a\nrank stranger. I figured it was thumbs down for me. I knew I couldn\u2019t\nswim ashore in that current, and I knew she\u2019d founder as soon as she\nstruck those rips.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe isn\u2019t going to strike the rips,\u201d my bolt cutter put in. \u201cLook at\nthe old packet.\u201d\n\nThe _Grosbeak_ lay over on her side and skidded\u2014that is the only way I\ncan describe her action\u2014skidded right into the whirlpool, and spun\nthere a dozen turns. Then, curiously, her broad fan-tail stern sucked\ndown, down till the bluff bow pointed skyward, and so spinning, she\ndisappeared.\n\n\u201cEither way,\u201d said the man, with a shrug of his shoulders, \u201cit made no\ndifference.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t,\u201d Joe observed quietly.\n\n\u201cThanks to you, I didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cStill\u2014I wasn\u2019t particular.\u201d\n\nI looked at him attentively. He nursed his chin in one hand, staring\nat the place where the _Grosbeak_ had been, a queer, pursed-up twist\nto his lips. For a man who had cheated death by scant ten feet of\nmanila, he was singularly calm, even indifferent.\n\n\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe _Grosbeak\u2019s_ a stranger through\nthese waters.\u201d\n\n\u201cNanaimo boat,\u201d said he. \u201cBelongs to the G. G. Fish Company. We\nstarted through Hell Gate in plenty of time to get through on the\nfirst of the run. But she dropped her propeller. You can guess the\nrest. Except that the skipper\u2014there were just the two of us\u2014got\npanicky when she began to take water in some of the boiling places. He\nwas so afraid for his life that he threw it away.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d I inquired.\n\n\u201cTook the dinghy to row ashore,\u201d the man grinned. \u201cA whirl caught\nhim.\u201d\n\nHe turned his thumb down expressively.\n\n\u201cSo here I am,\u201d he continued, \u201csafe and sound, which I didn\u2019t look\nfor. Sitting on a rock in a shirt and overalls. Oh, well, it\u2019ll be all\nthe same a hundred years from now.\u201d\n\n\u201cLess time than that,\u201d I smiled. \u201cIn the meantime, come on to the\ncabin and get some dry clothes on\u2014both of you.\u201d\n\nThat is how Ed Broderick happened into my camp at Skeleton Point and\ngave me a pair of human enigmas to observe. He seemed quite\nindifferent as to where he went or what he did. A certain cynically\ncheerful humor came over him when he was dried and fed. He had no\nstrings on him, he declared. The G. G. Company owed him no wages, and\nhis duty to them ended with reporting the matter. And the upshot of\nthat near-tragedy was that Broderick took on a job with me, cutting\ncedar into bolts for the hungry shingle saws.\n\nFrom the very beginning he seemed to exercise a tonic effect on Joe. I\ndon\u2019t attempt to explain it. I know that it worked out that way. The\ntwo became fast friends. Broderick could always banish those silent\nspells of brooding under which Joe fell. He could make him grin, rouse\nhim out of that deadly absorption in himself. They had in common the\nfact that both were afflicted with the itching foot, both had a past\nof which they never talked. Both were men of education, both were of\nthe East. It showed in their inflections, their mannerisms. But the\nterritory beyond the Rockies lay always ignored in the speech.\n\nOtherwise it seemed that from the Gulf of Georgia to San Diego harbor\ntheir trails had crossed and recrossed unknowingly in the last four\nyears. Many the incident they recalled where each had been among those\npresent\u2014a riot in a California hop field, a Frontier Day in Oregon,\nthe stranding of a battleship on the bleak Washington coast. Brothers\nin unrest, they were, and I, listening to their talk of these things,\nwondered more and more what turn of fortune\u2019s wheel had set Joe\nGalloway\u2019s feet in these troubled ways.\n\nTime passed, however, and Joe seemed to brighten up. So far as\nBroderick went, he was a mighty man with ax and saw, and my bolt piles\nrose in corded ricks. Some devil rode him, too, at times, but it rode\nhim to drink more than was good for him, and to fight like a tiger\nwhen the liquor was on him. He seldom sat and pondered. He was all\naction. In the following two months, he broke out at divers times in\nthis fashion. And one evening when the three of us were sitting with\nour pipes\u2014I having let my other man go\u2014Joe took him mildly to task.\nThey had got so chummy that they had planned a prospecting and\ntrapping trip when my contract was finished:\n\n\u201cWhat satisfaction is there in going on one of these rampages?\u201d Joe\nasked. \u201cYou only hurt yourself and make enemies of the men you bruise\nup in those wild rows.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a matter of satisfaction,\u201d Broderick replied\nthoughtfully. \u201cOnly life seems to me now and then to be nothing but a\nghastly joke. And I get a crazy impulse to tear everything to pieces.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat hit _you_ below the belt?\u201d Joe asked softly.\n\n\u201cMyself, I guess,\u201d Broderick grunted. \u201cCircumstances. Most of us have\nour skeletons. When mine rattles I hate the noise so bad I try to\ndrown it out any old way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile I sit still and listen to the clatter of the bones\u2014or I used\nto\u2014\u2014\u201d Joe threw out his hands impatiently. \u201cDamn it, you\u2019re right, Ed.\nLife _is_ a ghastly joke sometimes. It lifts a man to the pinnacle of\nhis dreams\u2014and then blows up the pinnacle. Look at me. Five years ago\nI could say honestly and fervently that the world was mine\u2014or that\npart thereof that I desired. I had everything a man wants\u2014money,\nfriends, a home, a woman\u2019s love. And I had to give it all up. It\nburned me. It hurts yet. I guess I let it hurt me, because it\u2019s always\nbeen simmering in my mind, and I\u2019ve never been able to talk about it\nto any one\u2014never wanted to. I hugged it to myself, and went about\ncrying to myself against fate. And still\u2014I\u2019ve often wondered if I\u2019m\nany different from other men; if the same thing comes to other men,\nand if they take it the same way?\u201d\n\nHe looked up. Broderick was staring absently out over the tide race\npast Skeleton Point, and Joe met only my mildly questioning gaze. He\nsmiled gently.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t murder anybody, nor loot a bank, nor commit any felony\nwhatever to send me on the tramp under an assumed name, Steve,\u201d he\nsaid to me. \u201cI suppose when I put it in plain words it all sounds like\na confession of sheer weakness. It was very simple. You remember how\neverything was with me when you were back there? You remember Norma?\u201d\n\nI nodded.\n\n\u201cFour years ago,\u201d he continued, \u201clike lightning out of a clear sky,\nshe told me one day that our life had been an utter failure\u2014that she\nhad ceased to love me, that she had grown to love another man, and\nthere was no use trying to go on.\n\n\u201cMan,\u201d he broke out passionately, \u201cit drove me nearly mad, with the\ncombined madness of grief and jealous rage. I knew I loved her, but\nuntil I saw myself losing her I never realized how much she meant to\nme, how my life was bound up in her. I humiliated myself, pleaded and\nraved and threatened. It seemed to me a madness that had stricken her.\nI couldn\u2019t see why such a thing had to be. There we were, happy, I\nthought, in our companionship. We had our home, our little circle of\nfriends, all the beautiful plans for the future that, we\u2019d made\ntogether. Nothing seemed to count\u2014nothing but the fact that she loved\nsome other man and no longer cared for me\u2014that she was living a lie,\nand that she was not going to live a lie any longer.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the other man. I never saw him, never learned his name\neven. I never could visualize him, somehow. But he was there somewhere\nin the background, with her hopes and dreams focused on him. I\ncouldn\u2019t seem to grasp that phase of it, why she should turn away from\nme, when she had loved me once, as I know she did. We\u2019d had our\ndifferences. Every man and woman living in the intimacy of marriage\nhas them. They were trifling things to me, I don\u2019t even know if it was\na mere succession of petty irritations that brought it about. But\nthere it was. And while she was sorry, while she regretted it, there\nwas only the one way out as she saw it. She had to get away from me,\nto live her own life in her own way. In every bitter discussion that I\nforced on her when I was lashing out against the impending break I\ndreaded so, I could see that she was getting farther and farther away\nfrom me, that I had no power to stir in her any emotion except\nresentment, and a little pity.\n\n\u201cSo I threw up my hands. I wanted to play fair, as she had played\nfair. She wanted to be free, and she was financially dependent on me\nalone. I cherished a glimmer of hope that she\u2019d come to her senses\u2014as\nI put it\u2014at the last minute. But she didn\u2019t. And so I sacrificed\neverything, turned it all into cash. I didn\u2019t care. Hell, there was a\nwhile I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I had to get quick action or go\nmad. She was leaving me, but I didn\u2019t want economic need to drive her\ninto another man\u2019s arms before she was ready. She wanted to avoid that\nherself. Oh, we talked it over time and again, talked soberly and\nsensibly when I felt like shutting off the breath in her white throat\nrather than let her go. That was only white-hot jealousy. I couldn\u2019t\nhelp it, but I did control it. When I\u2019d cleaned up everything I had\nabout eighteen thousand dollars in cash, and I\u2019d wrecked the\nfoundation of a fortune. But that seemed nothing beside this other\ndread thing that was happening. That gnawed at me day and night. And I\nhad to move with caution, to avoid open scandal. I wanted to save her\nthat. Oh, it was maddening! But the time came at last. I kept five\nthousand and gave her the rest. And I hit the trail. I had to. I\u2019ve\nbeen hitting it ever since.\n\n\u201cI never heard from her. I don\u2019t know how she\u2019s faring. I do know that\nI can\u2019t get away from the hurt of it. I\u2019ve lost something more than my\nmate. The heart to buck up and make life give me those things I used\nto value is clean gone. I strewed that five thousand dear across the\ncontinent trying to make myself forget. But I didn\u2019t. You can\u2019t knife\na man that way without leaving a sore wound. I peg along from day to\nday. But when I think of doing otherwise, when I think of trying to\nstart all over again, I find myself asking \u2018What\u2019s the use?\u2019 If I\ncould shut out all those old memories. But I can\u2019t. My mind keeps\neternally on them, like this back eddy, circling around what was and\nmight have been and can\u2019t be. I\u2019m a Samson shorn, without the mercy of\nperishing when the pillars of my house fell about me.\u201d\n\nJoe stopped and drew the palm of his hand over his forehead. His eyes\nwere glistening. He stared for a minute out over the uneasy gulf,\nunseeing, over Broderick\u2019s head. And Broderick\u2019s gaze was fixed on him\nwith a queer, half-pitying expression.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you ever go back or write to find out if, after all, your wife\nmight have been the victim of an illusion and only realized it when\nyou stepped out of her life?\u201d Broderick asked carelessly.\n\nJoe shook his head.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said he. \u201cI didn\u2019t give her up without a struggle, and when I\nhad to I let go completely. I couldn\u2019t persuade myself to make another\neffort. She knew her own mind, and she held to her determination when\nit was making me suffer like the damned. She was sorry. But I didn\u2019t\nwant her pity. I wanted her love.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get my point,\u201d Broderick pursued. \u201cIf you ask me, I\u2019d say\nyou acted like a fool\u2014any man\u2019s a fool to take a woman\u2019s actions for\ngranted until she\u2019s committed herself irrevocably. You\u2019ve been eating\nyour heart out for four years, and yet you don\u2019t even know but what\nshe\u2019s suffering as much as you do\u2014aching for you to come back. For all\nyou know, the very moment that you were gone and she was free to marry\nthe other man, it may have dawned on her that she didn\u2019t want to, that\nyou filled a place in her life no one else could possibly fill. I\ndon\u2019t think you\u2019ve got a very comprehensive knowledge of women, Joe,\nor of human nature in general. You two loved each other. All right.\nThat being so, you passed together through that peculiar ecstasy of\nfeeling that burns like a flame at mating, and, like a flame,\nsometimes burns out\u2014but always leaves smoldering embers. A man and a\nwoman can only have that emotional experience at its full intensity,\nonce. When you have had it, it\u2019s something that no one and nothing can\ntake away. Its impressions can\u2019t be ironed out as you can iron the\nwrinkles out of a piece of cloth. It\u2019s a bond between a man and a\nwoman as long as their hearts beat. Do you suppose that the hundred\nand one associations of your life together meant nothing to your\nwife?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t seem to,\u201d Joe answered sullenly. \u201cShe was sick of it all.\nShe thought she saw happiness in another direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason for that you probably know better than I do,\u201d Broderick\nsaid. \u201cBut if I loved a woman I\u2019d take _nothing_ for granted. Not even\nif she swore to her feelings on a stack of Bibles. She\u2019d have to prove\nher words by her deeds before I gave up hope. If she\u2019d been mine once,\nI\u2019d almost have to know she was finding comfort in another man\u2019s arms\nbefore I\u2019d be convinced that her feeling for me was dead. There\u2019d be\npain in that, but it would take about that to convince me. And by your\nown admission you don\u2019t know. You haven\u2019t given her or yourself a fair\nfighting chance. It\u2019s one thing to act in a whirl of feeling. Things\noften look altogether different when you\u2019ve dropped back to everyday\nliving. You took your hurt and ran away and nursed it. You didn\u2019t wait\nto see what happened after you\u2019d done your part. You don\u2019t know but\nshe\u2019s somewhere nursing a grief that overtook her the minute you took\nyourself beyond sight and hearing of her.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo chance,\u201d Joe muttered.\n\n\u201cNo chance?\u201d Broderick echoed, with a tinge of scorn in his voice.\n\u201cThe law of probabilities is all on your side. I wish I felt my\nchances as good. I wish that my chance of happiness had been half as\ngood as yours. Would I throw up my hands and go wandering up and down\nthe earth with pain and uncertainty and self-pity like thorns in my\nflesh? I should say not!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d Joe answered somberly. \u201cThere\u2019s some things a\nman can\u2019t put into words. He can only feel them.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I do understand,\u201d Broderick insisted. \u201cI\u2019ve been through the\nmill. A man gets on the grid, and he can only squirm. I know what it\nis to ache with a pain that isn\u2019t physical. But with me it came of\nactual unescapable knowledge\u2014the pain of sheer unchangeable\nhopelessness. _You_ took a lot of things for granted. Seems to me you\nran away under fire.\u201d\n\nJoe threw out his hands impotently. \u201cWhat the devil else could I do?\u201d\nhe demanded harshly. \u201cShe had to be free\u2014free to marry the man she\nwanted. I could have stood on my rights as a husband. What was the\nuse? She\u2019d only have hated me. It wasn\u2019t any light love affair with\nher. She wasn\u2019t that kind. She wanted happiness\u2014she could only see it\nin a certain direction\u2014but she wanted it to come decently and\nhonorably. There was no ground for divorce. I had to devise a ground.\nSo I deserted her. As I saw it, there wasn\u2019t anything else for me to\ndo.\u201d\n\nBroderick\u2019s eyes gleamed.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a man,\u201d he said quietly, \u201ca real man. But a fool for all that,\nI think. Didn\u2019t it ever occur to you that she might really miss you\nafter those years of intimate living? That your clean sweep of\neverything might have made a gap in her life that nothing but you\nyourself could fill in again? A woman\u2019s human\u2014gifted or cursed, as you\nlike to put it\u2014with all the human vagaries of impulse. Sometimes it\ntakes a grand upheaval to make us see things as they really are\u2014to\nknow ourselves.\u201d\n\nJoe got to his feet and threw his arms wide to the sunset, and let\nthem fall by his side.\n\n\u201cWhy should I try to fool myself?\u201d he said. \u201cAll I want is to forget.\nThat\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nHe went into the cabin. We heard the creak of his bunk as he threw\nhimself down. Broderick clasped both hands over his knees and stared\nat the ground. His brows knitted, as over some problem he strove to\nsolve. After a minute, he looked at me.\n\n\u201cJoe unburdened his soul very completely,\u201d he said. \u201cDoes his right\nname happen to be Galloway?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, yes, that\u2019s his name,\u201d said I\u2014surprised into admission. \u201cHow did\nyou know?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d Broderick muttered. \u201cBut I had a hunch.\u201d\n\nHe sat for a little while, picking up pebbles and casting them over\nthe bank with a flip of his hand. Then he, too, rose and went into the\ncabin.\n\nThe door stood open beside me, and the small window above my head.\nEvery word they uttered within came distinctly to me. I heard\nBroderick repeat almost word for word, impatiently, challengingly, the\nlast questioning sentences he had put to Joe.\n\n\u201cWhy bother me with your theories,\u201d Galloway answered roughly. \u201cWhat\nis it to you? What do you know about these things I\u2019ve been fool\nenough to talk about?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know all there is to know about it,\u201d Broderick answered slowly. \u201cA\ngreat deal more than you yourself know. I\u2019m the other man.\u201d\n\nI drew beyond hearing at that. It lay between the two of them, a\nmatter intimate and grievous, not for casual ears. So I moved to the\ncorner, where only came the indistinguishable drone of their voices,\nwondering to myself if the devil that rises in men where a woman is\nconcerned would presently set them at each other\u2019s throats. They were\nstrong, passionate men. I was a little afraid for them, for I liked\nthem both.\n\nAn hour passed. Dusk merged into darkness. Still they talked, their\nvoices never rising above that repressed murmur. Then the lamp flashed\nits yellow square through the doorway, and both came out. Joe turned\naway and walked along the cliff slowly, a dim outline in the night.\nBroderick stood looking about. Presently he called:\n\n\u201cOh, Steve!\u201d\n\n\u201cHere!\u201d I answered.\n\nHe came and sat down on the ground beside me. The match he laid to his\npipe bowl showed his face hard-drawn. His eyes smoldered.\n\n\u201cDid you hear?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI heard you declare yourself,\u201d said I frankly. \u201cThen I moved out of\nearshot.\u201d\n\nHe sat silent for a time.\n\n\u201cJoe doesn\u2019t actively blame me,\u201d he said at last. \u201cBut he resents\neverything. He\u2019s lived within himself so long, bottling up his grief,\nthat he\u2019s morbid. I can\u2019t do anything with him, can\u2019t make him see\nsense. The thing he ought to do for their own two sakes\u2014write to Norma\nor go to her and make up\u2014he won\u2019t do. You knew her, it seems. You\nheard his side of it\u2014absolutely true, so far as it goes. But there\u2019s\ntwo sides to everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cFire away,\u201d said I\u2014for I knew by his tone that he was smoldering\ninside, that he wanted the relief of talk that would neither be\nmisunderstood nor resented.\n\n\u201cJoe made the same mistake that other men have made and regretted,\u201d\nBroderick went on, \u201cas near as I can gather. He let his ambition and\nhis business overshadow his wife and his home. I suppose he felt that\neverything was fixed and secure and final. And that\u2019s a bad thing with\nany woman young and proud and passionate as Norma Galloway. It was\nvery simple. Joe was getting wholly immersed in his business. He was\ntraveling a lot for his firm. And I happened to wander into her life\nat a time when she was in a peculiarly receptive state of mind. That\nsounds commonplace\u2014but I\u2019m not good at analysis. I loved her in my own\nheadlong way. Nothing else mattered to me but her. I knew where I\nstood. She thought she did. There wasn\u2019t anything sordid or underhand\nabout it. We talked it over from every angle, God knows. She wasn\u2019t\nhappy with him. All her feeling for him seemed dead. She knew I loved\nher, and she believed she loved me, and that for us two life together\nmeant happiness if we could take it up honorably together. So she told\nhim, and you know how he played his part.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Joe since we were kids,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019s a white man.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is,\u201d Broderick agreed. \u201cEvery inch of him. But, as I said,\nsomething of a fool where a woman\u2019s heart is concerned. He took too\nmuch for granted\u2014let go too easily. He didn\u2019t have anything but her\nword for it\u2014and a woman\u2019s word is nothing in matters of this sort. One\ncan talk and talk and never get anywhere. It\u2019s deeds that count. He\ndidn\u2019t give her a chance. He never saw me, never even knew my name. I\nwasn\u2019t looming a big figure before him to drive him insane with\nimpotent jealousy. But when the big upheaval came, he effaced himself\nas absolutely as if he had been buried. He made no effort to learn how\nthings went.\n\n\u201cAnd then\u201d\u2014Broderick bowed his head for a second\u2014\u201cthen, after he was\ngone, and there was nothing to do but wait patiently a little while,\nget a divorce quietly, and marry me, she woke up. It wasn\u2019t me she\nwanted. It was Joe. She\u2019d loved him in the beginning. When he\u2019d made\nthe complete renunciation, stepped out of her life for good and all,\nshe found something lacking, a place that nobody else could fill, that\nshe wanted him back, that her heart ached to have him back. Oh, you\ncan\u2019t ever tell anything about a woman. And yet, I suppose it was only\nnatural. He\u2019d become a part of her life. I was only an incident. I\nsuppose so many things used to rise up and make her long for him.\nShe\u2019d lived with him. The nearest she\u2019d ever been to me was to kiss me\nshyly once or twice.\n\n\u201cAnyway, once he was gone, it was all different. The money he gave her\nshe banked and left alone. She would no more have lived on it than she\nwould have let me support her. She used to say that she was being\npunished for breaking a good man\u2019s heart for a passing whim.\u201d\n\nBroderick lifted his head and laughed harshly.\n\n\u201cMeaning Joe, of course,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem to occur to her\nthat I was very deeply involved. The most she would let me do for her\nwas to help her get a position. I happened to have a cousin in the\nmillinery business in Utica, and Norma got work there\u2014enough to live\ndecently on. And when I\u2019d tried every means to move her, and failed, I\nhad to get out and get action or go crazy. So I went on the tramp,\nlike Joe, a good deal. I can live anywhere, under any conditions. And\nthere you are.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d he broke out, after a little, \u201cI didn\u2019t let go like he did. I\nwrote to her. Time and again, at first. Every few months since. That\u2019s\nhow I know where she is, and how she still feels. She\u2019s there yet,\npegging away, waiting. She\u2019s his wife, legally, in spirit, every way.\nShe\u2019s been true as steel. And her one solace is that some time he\u2019ll\ncome back, or she\u2019ll find out where he is and win him back and make up\nsomehow for these ghastly years.\n\n\u201cAnd can you see the tragedy in it?\u201d Broderick went on. \u201cHe refuses to\nact. He won\u2019t do anything. He says he has suffered till he\u2019s numb. And\nI can\u2019t make him see that she has suffered, too, is suffering yet, as\nhe is. It\u2019s pride. If I were in his place, I\u2019d have no pride. I\u2019d\ncrawl on my hands and knees in the dust back to her if I could create\nfor myself the longing she has for him. It isn\u2019t worth while to be\nproud and aloof and miserable when all you have to do is reach out\nyour hands for happiness. Two of us can get our feet out of this\ndeadly coil. Why should all three be lonely and miserable? I know he\ndoesn\u2019t want to have it that way. It\u2019s just a stubborn streak. He\u2019s\nmorbid. What has been can\u2019t be helped. But the future, that\u2019s a\ndifferent matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou might write and tell her where he is and how he feels about it,\u201d\nI suggested. \u201cThat would be a fine thing to do.\u201d\n\nBroderick laughed hard and mirthlessly.\n\n\u201cI suppose I could,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it would be better if he made the\nfirst move. However, I know _she_ wouldn\u2019t hesitate. Yes, I dare say\nit would be eminently proper for me to be the god in the machine\u2014to\nbring them together with a Heaven-bless-you-my-children\u2014and then fade\naway. Well, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll have to think about that.\u201d\n\nHe got up abruptly and walked into the cabin. When I followed, he was\nin his bunk, the blankets drawn over his head. A few minutes later,\nJoe came in. What sort of truce they had declared I never knew.\nBetween them as men there was genuine liking. If that matter of a\nwoman had stirred up feeling of any intensity between them, they were\nmen enough to repress it.\n\nSo, for a matter of two weeks, the days marched past, filled with the\nmonotonous labor of cutting and piling cedar bolts. The fall days were\non us, with their long, gray evenings. My bolt contract was about\ndone, and we took it easy, working short hours. The first man in\nkindled the kitchen fire, and also built another on the ground before\nthe cabin door. When we had eaten we would sit outside under the\nprojecting eave smoking our pipes before the cheerful crackling logs.\nIt was pretty much as it had been before that night of soul\nunburdenings\u2014except that we talked a bit less freely, there was more\nof constraint upon us.\n\nThen one evening, in the first gray of dusk, when we had knocked off\nearly and were sitting outside by the fire, watching the same tubby\ncoaster that had brought Galloway to Coderre go lurching past Skeleton\nPoint into the maw of Hell Gate, I heard the clatter of a buggy on the\nlittle-used road that ran between the landing and my camp. In a minute\nit gained the clearing. I saw the figure of a woman beside the driver.\nA few seconds later she was clambering out and walking toward us with\na firm step. Norma Galloway, just as I recalled her, fair strands of\nhair wind-blown across her face, deep blue eyes shining, lips a trifle\nparted, her gaze fixed on Joe.\n\nI turned to look for Broderick. He was all but behind the cabin, and\nhe beckoned me imperatively. I followed. It didn\u2019t matter, anyway.\nThere was only one man looming before her, and he stood rooted to the\nground as if he doubted the evidence of his visual sense.\n\nBroderick strode along the cliff. When I caught up with him he was\nseated on a log, holding his face in his hands.\n\n\u201cYou did write, And she came,\u201d I said\u2014for lack of something less\nobvious.\n\n\u201cShut up!\u201d he gritted. \u201cI\u2019m not in a talking mood.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know how long we sat there. Broderick did not move, nor lift\nhis head. It grew dark. I looked toward the cabin now and then, and\nonce saw the fire break into a yellow gleam when some one stirred it.\n\n\u201cI guess all\u2019s quiet along the Potomac.\u201d Broderick lifted his face at\nlast. \u201cI\u2019ve done my bit. Let\u2019s go back.\u201d\n\nWe walked slowly. Nearing the cabin and the soft glow before it, a\nstick broke in a shower of sparks and sent up a bright flame that\nthrew into bold relief two figures\u2014Joe on a block seat, his wife\ncurled on the earth beside smiled up at him, and then at me. There\nwasn\u2019t any further explanation needed.\n\n\u201cEd has gone,\u201d I said\u2014and added a white lie to smooth things. \u201cHe told\nme to wish you luck.\u201d\n\nIt seemed to me a shade of relief crossed both their faces. Love _is_\nselfish. But I couldn\u2019t blame them.\n\nI gave them the cabin that night and made my bed beside the fire. But\nI didn\u2019t sleep. No. Broderick loomed too big in my mind.\n\nThe back eddy had brought him unwitting to the spot, to straighten a\ngrievous tangle in two lives, to bring peace to unquiet souls. And it\nmight be that the eddy took him away. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve often\nwondered. I know I never saw him, never heard of him again.",
