    "body": "The stratoship from Cairo was late, and I was wondering whether the\nnewsreel theatre or a couple of drinks would make time pass faster.\nIt was early dusk. Through the immense, curved wall-window of the\nManhattan Port Room I could see the landing field, with a silvery ship\nbeing rolled over the tarmac, and the skyscrapers of New York beyond.\n\nThen I saw Arnsen.\n\nIt was Steve Arnsen, of course. No doubt about that. No other man had\nhis great breadth of shoulders, his Herculean build. Ten years ago we\nhad been classmates at Midwestern. I remembered rakehell, laughing,\nhandsome Steve Arnsen very well, with his penchant for getting into\ntrouble and out of it again, usually dragging Douglas O'Brien, his\nroom-mate, along with him like the helpless tail of a kite. Poor Doug!\nHe was the antithesis of Arnsen, a thoughtful, studious boy with the\nshadow of a dream lurking always in his dark eyes. An idealist was\nDouglas O'Brien, as his Celtic ancestors had been. Strong friendship\nhad existed between the two men--the mental communion of laughter and a\ndream.\n\nArnsen was looking up into the darkening sky, a queer tensity in his\nposture. He turned abruptly, came to a table near me, and sat down.\nFrom his pocket he took a small box. It snapped open. His gaze probed\ninto the unknown thing that was hidden by his cupped hands.\n\nI picked up my drink and went to Arnsen's table. All I could see was\nthe back of his sleek, massive head. Then he looked up--\n\nIf ever I saw hell in a man's face, I saw it in Arnsen's then. There\nwas a dreadful longing, and an equally horrible hopelessness, the\nexpression one might see on the face of a damned soul looking up from\nthe pit at the shining gates forever beyond his reach.\n\nAnd Arnsen's face had been--ravaged.\n\nThe searing mark of some experience lay there, branded into his\nfurrowed cheeks, his tightened lips, into his eyes where a sickness\ndwelt. No--this was not Steve Arnsen, the boy I had known at\nMidwestern. Youth had left him, and hope as well.\n\n\"Vail!\" he said, smiling crookedly. \"Good Lord, of all people! Sit down\nand have a drink. What are you doing here?\"\n\nI sought for words as I dropped into a chair. Arnsen watched me for a\nmoment, and then shrugged. \"You might as well say it. I've changed.\nYeah--I know that.\"\n\n\"What happened?\" There was no need to fence.\n\nHis gaze went beyond me, to the dark sky above the landing field. \"What\nhappened? Why don't you ask where Doug is? We always stuck together,\ndidn't we? Surprising to see me alone--\"\n\n\n\nHe lit a cigarette and crushed it out with an impatient gesture. \"You\nknow, Vail, I've been hoping I'd run into you. This thing that's been\nboiling inside of me--I haven't been able to tell a soul. No one would\nhave believed me. You may. The three of us kicked around together a\nlot, in the old days.\"\n\n\"In trouble?\" I asked. \"Can I help?\"\n\n\"You can listen,\" he said. \"I came back to Earth thinking I might be\nable to forget. It hasn't worked. I'm waiting for the airliner to take\nme to Kansas Spaceport. I'm going to Callisto--Mars--somewhere. Earth\nisn't the right place any more. But I'm glad we ran into each other,\nVail. I want to talk. I want you to answer a question that's been\ndriving me almost insane.\"\n\nI signalled the waiter and got more drinks. Arnsen was silent till we\nwere alone once more. Then he opened his cupped hands and showed me\na small shagreen box. It clicked open. Nestling in blue velvet was a\ncrystal, not large, but lovelier than any gem I had ever seen before.\n\nLight drifted from it like the flow of slow water. The dim shining\npulsed and waned. In the heart of the jewel was--\n\nI tore my eyes away, staring at Arnsen. \"What is it? Where did you get\nthe thing? Not on Earth!\"\n\nHe was watching the jewel, sick hopelessness on his face. \"No--not on\nEarth. It came from a little asteroid out there--somewhere.\" He waved\nvaguely toward the sky. \"It isn't charted. I took no reckonings. So I\ncan never go back. Not that I want to, now. Poor Doug!\"\n\n\"He's dead, isn't he?\" I asked.\n\nArnsen looked at me strangely as he closed the box and slipped it back\ninto his pocket. \"Dead? I wonder. Wait till you know the story, Vail.\nAbout Doug's lucky charm, and the dreams, and the Crystal Circe....\"\n\nThe slow horror of remembrance crept across his face. Out there, in\nspace, something had happened. I thought: It must have been frightful\nto leave such traces on Arnsen.\n\nHe read my thought. \"Frightful? Perhaps. It was quite lovely, too. You\nremember the old days, when I thought of nothing but raising hell....\"\n\nAfter a long pause, I said, \"Who was--the Crystal Circe?\"\n\n\"I never knew her name. She told me, but my brain couldn't understand\nit. She wasn't human, of course. I called her Circe, after the\nenchantress who changed her lovers to swine.\" Again he looked at the\ndarkening sky. \"Well--it began more than two years ago, in Maine. Doug\nand I were on a fishing trip when we ran into the meteorite. Little\nfishing we got done then! You know how Doug was--like a kid reading a\nfairy tale for the first time. And that meteorite--\"\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER ONE\n\n                             The Star-Gem\n\n\nIt lay in the crater it had dug for itself, a rounded arc visible about\nthe brown earth. Already sumac and vines were mending the broken soil.\nWarm fall sunlight slanted down through the trees as Douglas O'Brien\nand Steve Arnsen plodded toward the distant gurgling of the stream,\nthoughts intent on catching the limit. No fingering tendril of menace\nthrust out to warn them.\n\n\"Mind your step,\" Arnsen said, seeing the pit. He detoured around it\nand turned, realizing that O'Brien had not followed. \"Come on, Doug.\nIt's getting late.\"\n\nO'Brien's tanned young face was intent as he peered down into the\nhollow. \"Wait a bit,\" he said absently. \"This looks--say! I'll bet\nthere's a meteor down there!\"\n\n\"So there's a meteor. We're not fishing for meteors, professor. They're\nmostly iron, anyway. Gold, now, would be a different matter.\"\n\nO'Brien dropped lightly into the hole, scraping at the dirt with his\nfingers. \"Wonder how long it's been here? You run along, Steve. I'll\ncatch up with you.\"\n\nArnsen sighed. O'Brien, with his vast enthusiasm for everything under\nthe sun, was off again. There would be no stopping him now till he had\nsatisfied his curiosity about the meteorite. Well, Arnsen had a new fly\nhe was anxious to use, and it would soon be too late for good fishing.\nWith a grunt he turned and pushed on toward the stream.\n\nThe fly proved excellent. In a surprisingly short time Arnsen had\nbagged the limit. There was no sign of O'Brien, and hunger made itself\nevident. Arnsen retraced his steps.\n\nThe younger man was sitting cross-legged beside the crater, holding\nsomething in his cupped hands and staring down at it. A swift glance\nshowed Arnsen that the meteorite had been uncovered, and, apparently,\ncracked in two, each piece the size of a football. He stepped closer,\nto see what O'Brien held.\n\nIt was a gray crystal, egg-sized, filled with cloudy, frozen mists. It\nhad been cut into a diamond-shaped, multifaced gem.\n\n\"Where'd you get that?\" Arnsen asked.\n\nO'Brien jumped, turning up a startled face. \"Oh--hello, Steve. It was\nin the meteorite. Damnedest thing I ever saw. I saw the meteorite had\na line of fission all around it, so I smacked the thing with a rock. It\nfell apart, and this was in the middle. Impossible, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Let's see.\" Arnsen reached for the jewel. O'Brien showed an odd\nreluctance in giving it up, but finally dropped it into the other's\noutstretched hand.\n\nThe gem was cold, and yet not unpleasantly so. A tingling raced up\nArnsen's arm to his shoulder. He felt an abrupt, tiny shock.\n\nO'Brien snatched the jewel. Arnsen stared at him.\n\n\"I'm not going to eat it. What--\"\n\nThe boy grinned. \"It's my luck piece, Steve. My lucky charm. I'm going\nto have it pierced.\"\n\n\"Better take it to a jeweler first,\" Arnsen suggested. \"It may be\nvaluable.\"\n\n\"No--I'll keep it.\" He slipped the gem into his pocket. \"Any luck?\"\n\n\"The limit, and I'm starving. Let's get back to camp.\"\n\n\n\nOver their meal of fried trout, O'Brien fingered the find, staring into\nthe cloudy depths of the gem as though he expected to find something\nthere. Arnsen could sense a strange air of withdrawal about him. That\nnight O'Brien fell asleep holding the jewel in his hand.\n\nHis sleep was troubled. O'Brien watched the boy, the vaguest hint of\nworry in his blue eyes. Once Doug lifted his hand and let it fall\nreluctantly. And once a flash of light seemed to lance out from the\ngem, brief and vivid as lightning. Imagination, perhaps....\n\nThe moon sank. O'Brien stirred and sat up. Arnsen felt the other's eyes\nupon him. He said softly, \"Doug?\"\n\n\"Yes. I wondered if you were awake.\"\n\n\"Anything wrong?\"\n\n\"There's a girl....\" O'Brien said, and fell silent. After what seemed a\nlong time, he went on: \"Remember you said once that I'd never find a\ngirl perfect enough to love?\"\n\n\"I remember.\"\n\n\"You were wrong. She's like Deirdre of the Tuatha D\u00c3\u00a9, like Freya, like\nRan of the northern seas. She has red hair, red as dying suns are red,\nand she's a goddess like Deirdre, too. The Song of Solomon was made for\nher. 'Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.... I sleep,\nbut my heart waketh; it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh.'\nSteve,\" he said, and his voice broke sharply. \"It wasn't a dream. I\nknow it wasn't. She exists, somewhere.\" He stirred; Arnsen guessed that\nhe was peering at the gray jewel.\n\nThere was nothing to say. The frosty brilliance of the stars gleamed\nthrough the laced branches above. A curious breath of the unearthly\nseemed to drop down from the vast abyss of the sky, chilling Arnsen's\nheart.\n\nIn that moment he knew that his friend was ensorcelled.\n\nSuperstition--foolishness! He shook the thought away. But all the blood\nof his Northern ancestors rose up in him, the Vikings who had believed\nin Queen Ran of Ocean, in trolls and warlocks and the water-maidens who\nguard sunken gold.\n\n\"You're dreaming,\" he said stubbornly, more loudly than he thought.\n\"It's time we got back to the city. We've been here long enough.\"\n\nTo his surprise, O'Brien agreed. \"I think so. I've an idea I want to\nwork on.\" And the boy shut up like a clam, relaxing almost instantly\ninto peaceful slumber.\n\nBut Arnsen did not sleep for a long time. The stars seemed too close\nand, somehow, menacing. From the black void, eyes watched--not human\neyes, for all their loveliness. They were pools of darkest night, and\nstars glimmered within them.\n\nHe wished that O'Brien had not found the meteorite.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER TWO\n\n                          Lure of the Crystal\n\n\nThere was a change in the boy after that. The dream in his eyes did not\nfade, but he worked now with an intensity of purpose that had never\nexisted before. Previously, the two had held routine jobs in a huge\ncommercial organization. Without warning O'Brien quit. Arnsen followed\nsuit, feeling the necessity for staying close to the younger man. Yet\nin the days to come, he amounted to little more than excess baggage.\n\nO'Brien had plans. He borrowed money, scraped together enough to equip\na small laboratory, and there he worked long hours. Arnsen helped when\nhe could, though that was not often. He seldom knew exactly what the\nboy was trying to accomplish.\n\nOnce O'Brien said a queer thing. They were in the laboratory, awaiting\nthe result of an experiment, and Arnsen was pacing back and forth\nnervously.\n\n\"I wish I knew what was up, Doug,\" he said almost with anger. \"We've\nbeen at this for months now. What do you expect, anyway? You've had no\nmore than an ordinary training in physics.\"\n\n\"The jewel helps,\" O'Brien said. He took the gem from its suede bag and\nstared into the cloudy depths. \"I catch--thoughts from it.\"\n\nArnsen stopped short, staring. His face changed.\n\n\"You kidding?\" he demanded.\n\nO'Brien flushed. \"Okay, try it,\" he said, thrusting the stone at\nArnsen, who took it rather reluctantly. \"Shut your eyes and let your\nmind go blank. That does it, sometimes.\"\n\n\"I--all right.\" Arnsen squeezed his eyes closed and thought of nothing.\nInstantly a sick, horrible feeling swept through him--a terrible\nyearning such as he had never known before. So might the Assassins\nfeel, deprived of the magic drug that took them to Paradise. An\nAssassin exiled, cast into outer darkness.\n\nA face swam into view, lovely and strange beyond imagination. Only a\nglimpse he had, blotted out by rainbow, coruscating lights that darted\nand flashed like elfin fireflies. Then darkness, once more, and the\nfrightful longing--for what?\n\nHe let go of the gem; O'Brien caught it as it fell. The boy smiled\nwryly.\n\n\"I wondered if you'd get it, too. Did you see her?\"\n\n\"I saw nothing,\" Arnsen snarled, whirling toward the door. \"I felt\nnothing!\"\n\n\"Yet you're afraid. Why? I don't fear her, or the stone.\"\n\n\"The more fool you,\" Arnsen cast over his shoulder as he went out. He\nfelt sick and weak, as though unnameable vistas had opened before him.\nThere was no explanation for what he had felt--no sane explanation, at\nleast.\n\n\n\nAnd yet there might be, he thought, as he paced about the yard, smoking\nan endless chain of cigarettes. Telepathy, thought-transference--he had\nsimply caught what was in O'Brien's mind. But it was horrible to know\nthat Doug was feeling that soul-sick craving for the goddess-girl who\ncould not exist.\n\nO'Brien came out of the laboratory, eyes aglow. \"It's done,\" he said,\ntrying to repress his triumph. \"We've got the alloy at last. That last\ntreatment did the trick.\"\n\nArnsen felt vague apprehension. He tried to congratulate O'Brien, but\nhis tone rang false to his own ears. The boy smiled understandingly.\n\n\"It's been good of you to string along, Steve. The thing will pay off\nnow. Only--I'll need a lot of money.\"\n\n\"You'll have a lot. Plenty of companies will be bidding for the\nprocess.\"\n\nO'Brien said, \"I want enough to buy a spaceship.\"\n\nArnsen whistled. \"That's a lot. Even for a small boat.\" His eyes\nnarrowed. \"Why do you want it?\"\n\n\"I'm going to find Deirdre,\" the other said simply. \"She's out there,\nsomewhere.\" He tilted his head back. \"And I'll find her.\"\n\n\"Space is pretty big.\"\n\n\"I've a guide.\" O'Brien took out the gray gem. \"It wants to go to her,\ntoo. It wants to go back. It isn't really alive here on Earth, you\nknow. And I'm not just dreaming, Steve. How do you suppose I managed\nto make this alloy--the perfect plastic, tougher than beryllium steel,\nlighter than aluminum, a conductor or non-conductor of electricity\ndepending on the mix.... You know I couldn't have done it alone.\"\n\n\"You did it.\"\n\nO'Brien touched the jewel. \"I found out how to do it. There's life in\nhere, Steve. Not earthly life, but intelligent. I could understand a\nlittle, not much. Enough to work out the alloy. I had to do that first,\nso I could get money enough to buy a spaceship.\"\n\n\"You don't know how to pilot in space.\"\n\n\"We'll hire a pilot.\"\n\n\"We?\"\n\nHe grinned. \"I'm going to prove my point. You don't believe in Deirdre.\nBut you'll see her, Steve. The jewel will guide us. It wants to go\nhome--so we'll take it there.\"\n\nArnsen scowled and turned away, his big shoulders tense with\nunreasoning anger. He found himself hating the imaginary being O'Brien\nhad created. Deirdre! His fists clenched.\n\nShe did not exist. The major planets and satellites had been explored;\nthe inhabited ones held nothing remotely human. Martians were\nhuge-headed, spindle-legged horrors; Venusians were scaled amphibians,\nliving in a state of feudalism and constant warfare. The other\nplanets ... the avian, hollow-boned Callistans were closest to\nhumanity, but by no stretch of the imagination could they be called\nbeautiful. And Deirdre was beautiful. Imaginary or not, she was lovely\nas a goddess.\n\n_Damn her!_\n\nBut that did no good. O'Brien was not to be turned from his purpose.\nWith relentless, swift intensity he patented the alloy process, sold\nit to the highest bidder, and purchased a light space cruiser. He\nfound a pilot, a leather-skinned, tough, tobacco-chewing man named Tex\nHastings, who could be depended on to do what he was told and keep his\nmouth shut.\n\n\n\nO'Brien chafed with impatience till the cruiser jetted off from the\nspaceport. The closer he came to achieving his goal, the more nervous\nhe grew. The jewel he kept clenched in one hand most of the time.\nArnsen noticed that a dim brilliance was beginning to glow within it as\nthe ship plunged farther out toward the void.\n\nHastings cast quizzical glances at O'Brien, but did what he was told.\nHe confided in Arnsen.\n\n\"We haven't even bothered with charts. It's screwy, but I'm not\nkicking. Only this isn't piloting. Your friend just points at a\nstar-sector and says, 'Go there.' Funny.\" He scratched his leathery\ncheek, faded eyes intent on Arnsen's face.\n\nThe big man nodded. \"I know. But it isn't up to me, Hastings. I'm\nsuper-cargo.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Well, if you--want any help--you can count on me. I've seen\nspace-madness before.\"\n\nArnsen snorted. \"Space-madness!\"\n\nHastings' eyes were steady. \"I may be wrong, sure. But anything can\nhappen out here. We're not on Earth, Mr. Arnsen. Earth laws don't\napply. Neither does logic. We're on the edge of the unknown.\"\n\n\"I never thought you were superstitious.\"\n\n\"I'm not. Only I've been around, and seen a lot. That crystal Mr.\nO'Brien lugs around with him--I never saw anything like that before.\"\nHe waited, but Arnsen didn't speak. \"All right, then. I've known things\nto drift in from Outside. Funny things, damn funny. The Solar System's\nlike a Sargasso. It catches flotsam from other systems, even other\nuniverses, for all I know. One rule I've learned--when you can't guess\nthe answer, it's a good idea to stay clear.\"\n\nArnsen grunted moodily, staring out a port at the glaring brilliance of\nthe stars.\n\n\"Ever heard any stories about jewels like that one?\"\n\nHastings shook his closely-cropped head. \"No. But I saw a wreck once,\nSunside of Pluto--a ship that hadn't been designed in this System. It\nwas deserted; God knows how long it had been out there. Or where it\ncame from. Inside, it wasn't designed for human beings at all. It came\nfrom Outside, of course, and Outside is a big place. That jewel, now--\"\nHe bit the end off a quid of tobacco.\n\n\"What about it?\"\n\n\"It's an Outside sort of thing. And your friend isn't acting normal. It\nmay add up to trouble. It may not. My point is that I'm going to keep\nmy eyes open, and you'd be wise to do the same thing.\"\n\nArnsen went back to the galley and fried eggs, angry with himself for\nlistening to Hastings' hints. He was more than ever uncomfortable. Back\non Earth, it had been easier to disbelieve in any unknown powers that\nthe gray jewel might possess; here, it was different. Space was the\nhinterland, the waste that bordered the cryptic Outside. The forward\nstep in science that threw open the gates of interplanetary travel had,\nin a way, taken man back in time to a day when he cowered in a cave,\nfearing the powers of the dark that lurked in the unknown jungle.\nSpace travel had broken barriers. It opened a door that, perhaps,\nshould have remained forever closed.\n\nOn the shores of space strange flotsam was cast. Arnsen's gaze probed\nout through the port, to the red globe of Mars, the blinding brilliance\nof the Milky Way, the enigmatic shadow of the Coal Sack. Out there\nanything might lie. Life grown from a matrix neither Earthly nor even\nthree-dimensional. Charles Fort had hinted at it; scientists had\nhazarded wild guesses. The cosmic womb of space, from which blasphemous\nabortions might be cast.\n\nSo they went on, day after day, skirting Mars and plunging on into the\nthick of the asteroid belt. It was uncharted country now, a Sargasso of\nremnants from an exploded planet that had existed here eons ago. Sounds\nrang loudly in the narrow confines of the space ship. Nervousness\ngripped all three of the men. But O'Brien found comfort in the gray\ncrystal. His eyes held a glowing light of triumph.\n\n\"We are coming closer, Steve,\" he said. \"Deirdre isn't far away now.\"\n\n\"Damn Deirdre,\" Arnsen said--but not aloud.\n\nThe ship went on, following the blind course O'Brien pointed. Hastings\nshook his head in grim silence, and trained his passengers in the use\nof the space-suits. Few of the asteroids had atmosphere, and it became\nincreasingly evident that the destination was an asteroid....\n\n\n\n\n                             CHAPTER THREE\n\n                         The Singing Crystals\n\n\nThey found it at last, a jagged, slowly revolving ball that looked\nincredibly desolate, slag from some solar furnace. The telescope showed\nno life. The ball had hardened as it whirled, and the molten rock\nhad frozen instantly, in frigid space, into spiky, giant crags and\nstalagmites. No atmosphere, no water, no sign of life in any form.\n\nThe crystal O'Brien held had changed. A pale light streamed from it.\nO'Brien's face was tensely eager.\n\n\"This is it. Set the ship down, Hastings.\"\n\nThe pilot made a grimace, but bent toward the controls. It was a\nticklish task at best, for he had to match the ship's speed to the\nspeed of the asteroid's revolution and circle in, describing a\nnarrowing spiral. Rocket ships are not built for maneuverability. They\nblast their way to ground and up again through sheer roaring power.\n\nShe settled bumpily on the iron-hard surface of the asteroid, and\nArnsen looked through the thick visiglass at desolation that struck\na chill to his heart. Life had never existed here. It was a world\ndamned in the making, a tiny planetoid forever condemned to unbearable\nnight and silence. It was one with the darkness. The sun-glare, in\nthe absence of atmosphere, made sharp contrasts between light and jet\nshadow. The fingers of rock reached up hungrily, as though searching\nfor warmth. There was nothing menacing about the picture. It was\nhorrible in its lifelessness; that was all.\n\nIt was not intended for life. Arnsen felt himself an intruder.\n\nO'Brien met his glance. The boy was smiling, rather wryly.\n\n\"I know,\" he said. \"It doesn't look very promising, does it? But this\nis the place.\"\n\n\"Maybe--a million years ago,\" Arnsen said skeptically. \"There's nothing\nhere now.\"\n\nSilently O'Brien put the crystal in the giant's hand.\n\nFrom it a pulse of triumph burst out! Exultation! The psychic wave\nshook Arnsen with its intensity, wiped doubt from his face. Invisibly\nand intangibly, the jewel shouted its delight!\n\nThe glow within it waxed brighter.\n\nHastings said abruptly, \"Time to eat. Metabolism's higher in space. We\ncan't afford to miss a meal.\"\n\n\"I'm going out,\" O'Brien said.\n\nBut Arnsen seconded the pilot. \"We're here now. You can afford to wait\nan hour or so. And I'm hungry.\"\n\nThey opened thermocans in the galley and gulped the hot food standing.\nThe ship had suddenly become a prison. Even Hastings was touched with\nthe thirst to know what awaited them outside.\n\n\"We circled the asteroid,\" he said at last, his voice argumentative.\n\"There's nothing here, Mr. O'Brien. We _saw_ that.\"\n\nBut O'Brien was hurrying back to the control cabin.\n\nThe suits were cumbersome, even in the slight gravity. Hastings tested\nthe oxygen tanks strapped on the backs, and checked the equipment with\nstringent care. A leak would be fatal on this airless world.\n\n\n\nSo they went out through the airlock, and Arnsen, for one, felt his\nmiddle tightening with the expectation of the unknown. His breathing\nsounded loud and harsh within the helmet. The tri-polarized faceplates\nof the helmets were proof against sun-glare, but they could not\nminimize the horrible desolation of the scene.\n\nA world untouched--more lifeless, more terrible, than frigid Jotunheim,\nwhere the Frost Giants dwelt. Arnsen's heavily-leaded boots thumped\nsolidly on the slag. There was no dust here, no sign of erosion, for\nthere was no air.\n\nIn O'Brien's hand the crystal flamed with milky pallor. The boy's face\nwas thin and haggard with desire. Arnsen, watching, felt hot fury\nagainst the incubus that had worked its dark spell on the other.\n\nHe could do nothing--only follow and wait. His hand crept to the\nweighted blackjack in his belt.\n\nHe saw the hope slowly fade from O'Brien's eyes. Against his will he\nsaid, \"We're only on the surface, Doug. Underground--\"\n\n\"That's right. Maybe there's an entrance, somewhere. But I don't know.\nWe may be a thousand years too late, Steve.\" His gaze clung to the\ncrystal.\n\nIt pulsed triumphantly. Pale flame lanced joyously from it. Alive it\nwas; Arnsen had no doubt of that now. Alive, and exulting to be home\nonce more.\n\nYears too late? There was not the slightest trace of any artifact on\nthis airless planetoid. The bleakness of outer space itself cast a veil\nover the nameless world. The three men plodded on.\n\nIn the end, they went back to the ship.\n\nThe quick night of the tiny world had fallen. The flaming corona of the\nsun had vanished; stars leaped into hard, jeweled brilliance against\nutter blackness. The sky blazed with cold fires.\n\nLifeless, alien, strange. It was the edge of the unknown.\n\nThey slept at last; metabolism was high, and they needed to restore\ntheir tissues. Hours later Arnsen came to half wakefulness. In his\nbunk he rose on one elbow, wondering what had roused him. His mind felt\ndulled. He could scarcely tell whether or not he was dreaming.\n\nAcross the ship a man's head and shoulders were silhouetted against a\nport, grotesquely large and distorted. Beyond, the stars blazed.\n\nThey moved. They swirled in a witch-dance of goblin lanterns, dancing,\nwhirling, spiraling. Blue, yellow, amethyst and milky pearl, streaks of\nlight golden as the eye of a lioness--and nameless colors, not earthly,\nmade a patterned arabesque as they danced their elfin saraband there in\nthe airless dark.\n\nThe dark swallowed Arnsen. Slumber took him....\n\n\n\nSlowly, exhaustedly, he came back to consciousness. His head ached; his\ntongue was thick. For a moment he lay quietly, trying to remember.\n\nDream? Arnsen cursed, threw his blankets aside, and sprang from the\nbunk.\n\nO'Brien was gone. Tex Hastings was gone. Two space-suits had vanished\nfrom their racks.\n\nArnsen's face twisted into a savage mask. He knew, now, what had been\nso wrong about his vision of the night. The man he had glimpsed at the\nport had been _outside_ the ship. Doug?\n\nOr Hastings. It did not matter. Both men were gone. He was alone, on\nthe mystery world.\n\nArnsen set his jaw, gulped caffeine tablets to clear his head, and\nwrenched a space-suit from its hooks. He donned it, realizing that\nsunlight once more was pouring down from the distant sun.\n\nSoon he was ready. He went out of the ship, climbed atop it, and stared\naround. Nothing. The bleak, light-and-shadow pattern of the asteroid\nstretched to the sharply curving horizon all around. There was nothing\nelse.\n\nNor were there tracks in the iron-hard slag. He would have to search\nat random, by pure guesswork. In the low gravity his leap to the\nground scarcely jarred him. He gripped the billy at his left and moved\nforward, toward a high pinnacle in the distance.\n\nHe found nothing.\n\nWorst of all, perhaps, was the horrible loneliness that oppressed\nhim. He was too close to Outside now. He was the only living thing\nin a place never meant for human life. The ghastly bleakness of the\nasteroid sank like knife-blades into his mind, searing it coldly. There\nwas no relief when he looked up. The distant sun, with its corona,\nwas infinitely far away. The rest of the sky held stars, remote, not\ntwinkling as on Earth, but shining with a cold intensity, a pale fury\nrelentless and eternal. In the light the heat seared him through his\narmor; in the shadows he shivered with cold.\n\nHe went on, sick with hate, seeking the unknown thing that had taken\nDoug.\n\nThe boy was a poet, a dreamer, a fool, easy victim for the terror that\nhaunted the asteroid.\n\nExhausted, he turned back. His air supply was running low, and there\nwas no sign of either Doug or Hastings. He headed for the ship....\n\nIt was further than he had thought. He sighted it at last, beneath a\ntowering stalagmite that thrust up into the harsh sunlight, and his\nsteps quickened. Why hadn't he thought to bring extra cylinders of\noxygen?\n\nThe lock stuck under his gloved, awkward fingers; he wrenched at it\nsavagely. At last the great valve swung open. He went through the\nairlock, opened his visiplate, and took great breaths of the fresher\nair. Oxygen cylinders were racked near by; he swung several into\nposition on his back and clamped them into place. He gulped more\ncaffeine tablets.\n\nSome instinct made him turn and look back through the port. Over the\nuneven ground a space-suited figure was staggering, a quarter of a mile\ndistant....\n\nArnsen's heart jumped. In one swift motion he clamped shut his\nvisiplate and leaped for the airlock. It seemed an eternity before he\nwas outside, leaping, racing, straining toward the man who had fallen\nhelpless, a motionless shadow amid the glare. Doug? Hastings?\n\n\n\nIt was O'Brien, his young face gray with exhaustion and flushed with\noxygen-thirst. For a moment Arnsen thought the boy was dead. He\nthrust one arm under O'Brien's back, lifting him; with the other hand\nhe fumbled at an auxiliary air-hose, thrusting it into the valve in\nO'Brien's chin-plate as he ripped away the useless hose. Oxygen flowed\ninto the boy's suit.\n\nHis nostrils distended as he drank in the precious air. Arnsen watched,\nteeth bared in a mirthless grin. Good! Color came back to O'Brien's\ncheeks--a healthy flush under the deep tan. His eyes opened, looked\ninto Arnsen's.\n\n\"Couldn't find her,\" he whispered, his voice hollow through the\naudiophone. \"Deirdre--I couldn't find her, Steve.\"\n\nArnsen said, \"What happened, Doug?\"\n\nO'Brien took a deep breath and shook his head. \"I woke up--something\nwarned me. This.\" He unclasped his gloved hand and showed the milky\ncrystal. \"It knew--she--was close. I felt it. I woke up, went to a\nport, and saw the--the lights. Hastings was out there. She'd called\nhim, I guess. He was running after the lights.... I had sense enough to\nput on my suit. Then I followed. But Hastings was too fast for me. I\nfollowed till I lost him. Miles--hours. Then I saw my oxygen was low. I\ntried to get back to the ship--\"\n\nHe tried to smile. \"Why did she call Hastings, Steve? Why not me?\"\n\nArnsen felt cold. \"We're getting off this asteroid. Right away.\"\n\n\"Leaving Hastings?\"\n\n\"We--I'll look for him myself. There's life here, malignant life.\nPlenty dangerous.\"\n\n\"Not evil. No. Beyond evil, beyond good. I'm not going, Steve.\"\n\n\"You're going if I have to hog-tie you.\"\n\nO'Brien's gloved hand tightened on the milky crystal. \"Deirdre!\" he\nsaid.\n\nAnd, in the emptiness above them, a glow brightened.\n\nThere was no other warning. Arnsen tilted back his head to see--the\nincredible.\n\n_Deirdre_, he thought. Then, unbidden, another name leaped into his\nmind.\n\n_Circe!_\n\nCirce of Colchis, goddess of Aea--Circe, Daughter of the Day, who\nchanged men to swine! Circe--more than human!\n\nFor this was no human figure that hovered above them. It seemed to be\na girl, unclad, reclining in nothingness, her floating hair tinted\nlike the rays of a dying sun. Her body swept in lines of pure beauty,\nlong-limbed and gracious. Her eyes were veiled; long lashes hid them.\n\nThere was tenderness in her face, and aloofness, and alienage. There\nwas beauty there--not entirely human beauty.\n\nRainbow crystals garmented her.\n\nSome large, some small, multi-faceted gems danced and shimmered\nagainst the blackness of the sky and the whiteness of Circe's body.\nMoon-yellow, amber-gold, blue as the sea off Capri, green as the\npine-clad hills of Earth--angry scarlet and lambent dragon-green!\n\nWith some distantly sane corner of his mind, Arnsen realized that it\nwas impossible for any living being to exist without protection on the\nfrigid, airless surface of the asteroid. Then he knew that both air and\nwarmth surrounded the girl.\n\nThe crystals protected her. He knew that, somehow.\n\nO'Brien twisted in his arms. He saw the girl, tried to spring free.\nArnsen gripped him.\n\nThe boy swung a jolting blow that jarred the giant's helmet. His mailed\nglove smashed against the metal plate. Dazed and giddy, Arnsen fell\nback, clawing at O'Brien. His fingers slipped along the other's arm; he\nfelt something drop into his hand, and clutched it.\n\nThen O'Brien was free. He wrenched an oxygen-tank from Arnsen's\nshoulders, whirled, and took a step toward the girl. She was further\naway now....\n\nArnsen staggered up. His head was throbbing furiously. Too late he\nrealized that, in the scuffle, his air-valve had fouled. He fumbled at\nit with clumsy fingers--and fell.\n\nHis helmet thudded solidly against hard slag. Blackness took him....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nCirce the Immortal\n\n\nIt was dark when he woke. Oxygen was once more pouring into his suit;\nhe had managed to open the valve before falling. Far above, the\ndistant, corona-crowned sun flamed against the starry backdrop. The\nship lay beneath its crag.\n\nBut of O'Brien there was no trace whatever.\n\nAfter that, something akin to madness came to Arnsen. Again the utter\nloneliness of space crushed down on him, with suffocating terror. Doug\nwas gone, like Hastings. Where?\n\nHe searched, then, and in the days thereafter. He grew haggard and\ngaunt, drugging himself with stimulants so he could drive himself\nbeyond his limit. Hour after hour he searched the tiny world, squinting\nagainst sun-glare, peering into black shadow, shouting O'Brien's name,\ncursing bitter, searing oaths that sounded futile to his ears. Time\ndragged on into an eternity. He had been here forever. He could not\nremember a time when he had not been plodding across the asteroid,\nwatching for a glimpse of a space-suited figure, of dancing jewels of\nfire, of a slim white body....\n\nWho was she? _What_ was she? Not human--no. And the crystals, what were\nthey?\n\nHe returned to the ship one day, shoulders slumping, and passed the\nspot where he had seen the girl. Something on the ground caught his\neye. A pearly, shining gem.\n\nHe remembered his scuffle with O'Brien, and the thing that had dropped\ninto his glove.\n\nThe jewel, of course. It had lain here, unnoticed, for many revolutions\nof the asteroid.\n\nHe picked it up, staring into the milky depths. A pulse tingled up his\narm, fingering into his mind. A pulse of longing--\n\nThe girl had appeared when O'Brien summoned her.\n\nPerhaps it would work again. There was no other hope.\n\nBut he could not call her Deirdre. He gripped the hard crystal. His\nthought probed out, forceful and summoning.\n\n\"_Circe!_\"\n\nNothing. The eternal silence, the cold blaze of the stars....\n\n\"_Circe!_\"\n\nThe gem in his hand leaped with eagerness. In emptiness above him a\nrainbow glitter of coruscating light flamed. The crystals--and, within\nthem, the girl!\n\nShe had not changed. Lovely and alien, she lay among her dancing,\nshining gems, and her lashes still veiled the cryptic depth of her\neyes. Arnsen stumbled forward.\n\n\"Where's O'Brien?\" His voice cracked, harsh and inhuman. \"Damn you!\nWhere is he?\"\n\nShe did not look at him. Her body seemed to recede. The jewels swirled\ninto swift motion about her.\n\nArnsen lurched on. His mind felt on fire. He whipped out his elastic\nbilly and plunged toward the girl.\n\nShe was not there. She had drifted back amid the rainbow crystals.\n\nArnsen could not overtake her. It was like following a\nwill-o'-the-wisp, a torch of St. Elmo's fire. But he did not take his\neyes from the girl. More than once he fell. She was leading him away\nfrom the ship, he knew. That did not matter. Not if she also led him to\nDoug.\n\nWhat had she done with the boy? He hated her, hated her relentless\ninhumanity, her incredible beauty. Teeth bared, red-rimmed eyes\nglaring, Arnsen plunged on in a nightmare race across the face of the\nsilent asteroid.\n\nHours later, it seemed, she vanished in black shadow under a thrusting\npinnacle of slag. Arnsen followed, reeling with fatigue, expecting to\ncannon into a rock wall. But the darkness remained intangible. The\nground sloped down beneath his leaded boots. Suddenly light shone\nthrough a cleft at his side.\n\nPale, warm, liquid light, it drifted up from a slanting corridor in\nthe rock. Far down the passage Arnsen could see the cloud of dancing\nflames that marked the girl's crystal attendants. He stumbled on.\n\nDown he went, and down, till at last the passage turned again in the\ndistance. He rounded the bend--and stopped, blinded and dazed.\n\n\n\nAs his vision adjusted itself, Arnsen made out a pillar of fire that\nrose from floor to ceiling of the cavern before him. Yet it was not\nfire. It was something beyond human knowledge. Pure energy, perhaps,\nwrenched from the locked heart of the atom itself, silently thundering\nand pouring up like a geyser. The pillar shook. It wavered and rocked,\ncoldly white, intensely brilliant, like a living thing blazing with a\npower inconceivable.\n\nWalls and floor and roof of the cavern were crusted with jewels. The\nrainbow crystals clung quivering, thousands of them, some tiny, others\nhuge. They watched.\n\nThey were alive.\n\nThe girl stood near Arnsen. A score of the jewels pressed against her\nlovingly. They caressed her. The veiled eyes did not meet Arnsen's. But\nshe lifted her arm.\n\nThere was a movement in Arnsen's gloved hand. The milky gem stirred; a\npulse of eagerness beat out from it.\n\nIt leaped free--raced toward Circe.\n\nShe caught it, flung it at the shaking tower of flame.\n\nInto the pillar's blazing heart the crystal darted.\n\nThe fires sank--rose again. Spewed forth the jewel.\n\nNo longer milky--no longer dulled. It blazed with fantastic brilliance!\nVital energy streamed from it; it whirled and danced joyously with\nsheer delight. It was like a sleeper suddenly awakened.\n\nIt spun toward Circe, pulsed madly with the intoxication of life.\n\nThe girl rose, featherlight, without gravity, drifting across the\ncavern to a passage-mouth that gaped in the wall. The jewels clustered\naround it swayed toward her. Some broke free, rushing in her train.\n\nShe vanished into the portal.\n\nThe spell that held Arnsen broke. He flung himself after her, too late.\nAlready she was gone. But along the corridor jewels floated, bright,\nshining, alive.\n\nAnd suddenly strong arms were around Arnsen. The face of O'Brien\nwas before him. O'Brien, no longer wearing his space-suit, haggard,\nand yet aflame with a vital something that glowed in his dark eyes.\nO'Brien--laughing.\n\n\"Steve!\" His voice shook. \"So you followed me. I'm glad. Come in\nhere--it's all right.\"\n\nThe energy went out of Arnsen, leaving him weak and exhausted. He\ncast one glance up the empty corridor and followed O'Brien through a\ncave-opening into a little room cut out of solid rock. He felt the\nother's fingers loosening his helmet, removing the bulky space-suit.\nSome remnant of caution returned.\n\n\"The oxygen--\"\n\n\"There's air here. It's a place of wonders, Steve!\"\n\nThere was air. Cool, sweet, and refreshing, it crept into Arnsen's\nlungs. He looked around. The little cavern was empty, save for dozens\nof the rainbow crystals clinging to the walls.\n\nThey watched alertly.\n\nO'Brien pressed him back, made a quick gesture. A jewel floated\nforward, hovering over Arnsen's face. He felt water trickling between\nhis lips, and, too exhausted for wonder, swallowed gratefully.\n\n\"You need sleep,\" O'Brien said. \"But it's all right, Steve. It's all\nright, I tell you. You'll hear all about it when you wake up. Time\nenough then. You'll see Deirdre.\"\n\nArnsen tried to struggle up. \"I won't--\"\n\nO'Brien signalled again. Another gem drifted close. From it a gray\nbreath of cloud floated, perfume-sweet, soporific. It crept into\nArnsen's nostrils....\n\nAnd he slept.\n\n\n\n\n                             CHAPTER FIVE\n\n                            The Jewel-Folk\n\n\nThe room was unchanged when he woke once more. O'Brien sat\ncross-legged, looking into space. His face had altered, had acquired a\nnew peace and maturity.\n\nHe heard Arnsen's slight movement and turned.\n\n\"Awake? How do you feel?\"\n\n\"All right. Well enough to hear explanations,\" Arnsen said with a flash\nof temper. \"I've been nearly crazy--looking for you all over this\ndamned asteroid. I still think I'm crazy after all this.\"\n\nO'Brien chuckled. \"I can imagine. I felt pretty upset for a while, till\nthe crystals explained.\"\n\n\"The crystals _what_?\"\n\n\"They're alive, Steve. The ultimate product of evolution, perhaps.\nCrystalline life. Perfect machines. They can do almost anything. You\nsaw how one created drinkable water, and--well, look here.\" He beckoned.\n\nA jewel floated close. From it a jet of flame shot, red and brilliant.\nO'Brien waved his hand; the gem drifted back to its place.\n\n\"They can convert energy into matter, you see. It's logical, when you\nforget about hide-bound science. All matter's made up of energy. It's\nsimply locked in certain patterns--certain matrixes. But inside the\natom--the framework of matter--you've got nothing but energy. These\ncrystals build patterns out of basic energy.\"\n\nArnsen shook his head. \"I don't see it.\"\n\nO'Brien's voice grew deeper, stronger. \"Long ago--very long ago, and\nin another galaxy, light-years away, there was a civilization far\nbeyond ours. Deirdre is a child of that race. It was--mighty. It passed\nthrough our culture-level and went far beyond. Till machines were no\nlonger needed. Instead, the race made the crystals--super-machines,\nsuper-robots, with incredible powers locked in them. They supplied all\nthe needs of Deirdre's race.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"This asteroid doesn't belong to our family of planets. It's from\nthat other system, in the neighboring galaxy. It drifted here by\naccident, I think. I don't quite know the facts of it. It came under\nthe gravitational pull of a comet, or a wandering planet, and was\nyanked out into space. Eventually it settled into this orbit. Deirdre\ndidn't care. Her mind isn't like ours. The crystals supplied all her\nneeds--made air, gave her food and water. Everything she desired.\"\n\nArnsen said, \"How long has this been going on?\"\n\n\"Forever, perhaps,\" O'Brien said quietly. \"I think Deirdre's immortal.\nAt least she is a goddess. Do you remember the crystal I found in that\nmeteorite?\"\n\n\"Yeah. I remember.\"\n\n\"It came from here. It was one of Deirdre's servants. Somehow it was\nlost--wandered away. Cosmic dust collected on it as it moved in an\norbit around the sun--for thousands of years, perhaps. Iron atoms. At\nlast it was a meteorite, with the crystal at its heart. So it fell on\nEarth, and I found it, and it wanted to go home, back to Deirdre. It\ntold me that. I felt its thoughts. It drew me here, Steve--\"\n\nArnsen shivered. \"It's unbelievable. And that girl isn't human.\"\n\n\"Have you looked into her eyes?\"\n\n\"No--\"\n\n\"She isn't human. She is a goddess.\"\n\nA new thought came to Arnsen. \"Where's Tex Hastings? Here?\"\n\n\"I haven't seen him,\" O'Brien said. \"I don't know where he is.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. What have you been doing?\"\n\n\"She brought me here. The crystals took care of me. And Deirdre--\" He\nstood up. \"She's summoning me. Wait, Steve--I'll be back.\"\n\nArnsen put out a detaining hand; it was useless. O'Brien stepped\nthrough the portal and was gone. A dozen crystals swept after him.\n\n\n\nArnsen followed, refusing to admit that he, too, wanted another glimpse\nof the girl. Down the passage he went in O'Brien's trail, till the\nboy vanished from sight. Arnsen increased his pace. He halted on the\nthreshold of the cavern where the pillar of flame swept up to the roof.\n\nHe had thought it thundered. It did not--it rushed up in utter silence,\nshaking and swaying with the surcharged intensity of its power. The\nwalls were crusted with the dancing, watching crystals. Now Arnsen saw\nthat some were dull gray, motionless and dead. These were sprinkled\namong the others, and there were thousands of them.\n\nO'Brien paced forward--and suddenly Circe was standing with her back to\nArnsen, the gems clustering about her caressingly. She lifted her arms,\nand O'Brien turned.\n\nA great hunger leaped into his face. The girl did not move, and O'Brien\ncame into the circle of her arms.\n\nSo swift was her movement that Arnsen did not realize it till too late.\nThe slender arms slid free; Circe stepped back a pace--and thrust\nO'Brien toward the tower of flame!\n\nHe stumbled, off balance, and the crystals leaped from Circe's body.\nThey were no longer a garment. They pressed against O'Brien, forcing\nhim away, thrusting, pushing. Arnsen cried out and sprang forward--\n\nO'Brien reeled, was engulfed by the flame-pillar. The pouring torrent\nswallowed him.\n\nSimultaneously from the farther wall a gray, dead jewel detached itself\nand shot toward the tower of fire. Into the blazing heart it fled and\nvanished.\n\nThe pillar sank down. It pulsed--thundered up again, silently streaming\nlike a torrent toward the roof. And out of its depths the jewel came\ntransformed.\n\nSentiment, blazing, shining with a myriad hues, it swirled toward\nCirce. Scintillant with delight, it hovered about her caressingly.\n\nIt was alive!\n\nArnsen cried out, flung himself forward. Circe turned to face him.\nStill her eyes were hidden; her face was aloofly lovely and inhuman.\n\nThe crystal swept toward Arnsen, cupping itself into his outthrust\nhand. From it a wave of mad delight rushed into his brain.\n\nIt was Doug--_it was Doug!_ Frozen with sick horror, Arnsen halted,\nwhile thoughts poured from the sentient crystal into his mind.\n\n\"The--the gray jewel--\" His tongue fumbled thickly with the words. He\nlooked up to where the dull gems clung among the shining ones.\n\n\"Machines, Steve.\" The thought lanced into him from the living\nthing he held. \"Robots, not energized. Only one thing can energize\nthem--life-force, vital energy. The flame-pillar does that, through\natomic transmutation. It's not earthly science--it was created in\nanother galaxy. There, Deirdre's race had slave people to energize the\ncrystals.\"\n\n\"Doug--she's killed you--\"\n\n\"I'm not dead. I'm alive, Steve, more alive than I ever have been.\nAll the crystals--Martians, Venusians, beings from other systems and\ngalaxies that landed on this asteroid. Deirdre took them for her own.\nAs she took Hastings. As she has taken me. We serve her now--\"\n\nThe jewel tore free from Arnsen's grip. It fled back to Circe, brushing\nher lips, caressing her hair. The other gems, scores of them, danced\nabout the girl like elfin lovers.\n\n\n\nArnsen stood there, sick and nauseated. He understood now. The\nintricate crystal machines were too complicated to work unless\nlife-force energized them. Circe, who took the minds of living beings\nand prisoned them in silicate robot-forms.\n\nThey felt no resentment. They were content to serve.\n\n\"Damn you!\" Arnsen mouthed, and took a step forward. His fists balled.\nHis fingers ached to curl about the girl's slender neck and snap it\nwith sharp, vicious pressure.\n\nHer lashes swept up. Her eyes looked into his.\n\nThey were black as space, with stars prisoned in their depths. They\nwere not human eyes.\n\nNow Arnsen knew why O'Brien had asked if he had looked into Deirdre's\neyes. They were her secret and her power. Her human form was not enough\nto enchant and enslave the beings of a hundred worlds. It was the\nsoul-shaking alienage that looked out of Circe's eyes.\n\nThrough those dark windows Arnsen saw the Outside. He saw the gulf\nbetween the stars, and no longer did he fear it. For Circe was a\ngoddess.\n\nShe was above and beyond humanity. A great void opened between her\nand the man, the void of countless evolutionary cycles, and a million\nlight-years of space. But across that gulf something reached and met\nand clung, and Arnsen's senses drowned in a soul-shaking longing for\nCirce.\n\nIt was her power. She could control emotion, as she could control the\ncrystals, and the power of her mind reached into Arnsen and wrung\nsanity and self from it. Only in outer semblance was she even slightly\nhuman. Beside her Arnsen was an animal, and like an animal he could be\ncontrolled.\n\nShe blazed like a flame before him. He forgot O'Brien, forgot Hastings\nand Earth and his purpose. Her power clutched him and left him helpless.\n\nThe grip upon his mind relaxed. Circe, confident of her triumph, let\nher eyelids droop.\n\nAnd Arnsen's mind came back in a long, slow cycle from the gulfs\nbetween the stars, drifted leisurely back into the crystalline cavern\nand the presence of the goddess--and woke.\n\nNot wholly. He would never be whole again. But he felt the crowding\nvibrations of the countless prisoners in crystal who had gone the way\nhis own feet were walking now, bewildered, drunken and drowning in\nemotions without name, sacrificing identity without knowing what they\nsacrificed. Flung into eternity at the whim of a careless goddess to\nwhom all life-forms were one....\n\nShe was turning half away as realization came back to Arnsen. She had\nlifted one round white arm to let the crystals cascade along it. She\ndid not even see him lurch forward.\n\nWhat he did was without thought. The emotions she had called up in him\ndrowned all thought. He only knew that he must do what he did--he could\nnot yet think why.\n\nThe breath hissed between his lips as he stumbled forward and thrust\nCirce into the flame....\n\n\n\nFrom the roof a gray jewel dropped. The tower of fire paused in its\nrhythm--beat out strongly again. From it a crystal leaped. It hung\nmotionless in the air, and Arnsen seized it with shaking fingers. He\nfelt great, racking sobs shake him. His fingers caressed the jewel,\npressed it to his lips.\n\n\"Circe!\" he whispered, eyes blind with tears. \"Circe--\"\n\n\n\n\n                              _Epilogue_\n\n\nArnsen had not spoken for a long time. Through the window I could see\nthe Cairo stratoship being wheeled into place. Beyond, the lights of\nNew York glowed yellow.\n\n\"And so you came back,\" I said.\n\nHe nodded. \"And so I came back. I put on my space-suit and went back\nto the ship. The crystals didn't try to stop me. They seemed to be\nwaiting. I don't know for what. I blasted off and headed Sunward. I\nknew enough to do that. After a while I began to send out S.O.S.\nsignals, and a patrol boat picked me up. That was all.\"\n\n\"Doug--\"\n\n\"Still there, I suppose. With all the others. Vail, why did I do it?\nWas I right?\" He didn't wait for an answer, but cupped the little\nshagreen box in his hand. He didn't open it.\n\n\"No,\" he went on, \"you can't answer me; nobody can. Circe took the soul\nout of my body, and I'm empty now. There's no peace for me on Earth,\nor in the space-ways. And out there, somewhere, on that asteroid, the\ncrystals are waiting--waiting for Circe to come back--\n\n\"But she will never come back. She will stay with me till I die, and\nthen she'll be buried with me in space. In the meantime--Circe doesn't\nlike it here on Earth. So I'm going out again. Sometime, perhaps, I'll\ntake her back Outside, to the unknown place from which she came. I\ndon't know--\"\n\nAn audio announced the plane for Kansas. Arnsen stood up, gave me a\nsmile from his ravaged face, and without a word went out.\n\nI never saw him again.\n\nI think that beyond Pluto, beyond the farthest limits of the system,\na little cruiser may be fleeing into the void, controls set, racing,\nperhaps, for the darkness of the Coal Sack. In the ship is a man and a\njewel. He will die, but I do not think that even in death his hand will\nrelax its grip on that jewel.\n\nAnd the ship will go on, into the blackness which has no name.\n\n",
