    "body": "The only friend in space Willard had ever known was dying. Dobbin's\nlips were parched and his breath came spasmodically. The tips of his\nfingers that had so many times caressed the control board of the _Mary\nLou_ were now black as meteor dust.\n\n\"We'll never see Earth again,\" he whispered feebly, plucked weakly at\nthe cover.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" Willard broke in hurriedly, hoping that the dying man\nwould not see through the lie. \"We've got the sun's gravity helping\nus drift back to Earth! We'll be there soon! You'll get well soon and\nwe'll start to work again on a new idea of mine....\" His voice trailed\nhelplessly away and the words were lost. It was no use.\n\nThe sick man did not hear him. Two tears rolled down his cheeks. His\nface contorted as he tried to withhold a sob.\n\n\"To see Earth again!\" he said weakly. \"To walk on solid ground once\nmore!\"\n\n\"Four years!\" Willard echoed faintly. He knew how his space mate felt.\nNo man can spend four years away from his home planet, and fail to be\nanguished. A man could live without friends, without fortune, but no\nman could live without Earth. He was like Anteus, for only the feel of\nthe solid ground under his feet could give him courage to go among the\nstars.\n\nWillard also knew what he dared not admit to himself. He, too, like\nDobbin, would never see Earth again. Perhaps, some thousand years from\nnow, some lonely wanderers would find their battered hulk of a ship in\nspace and bring them home again.\n\nDobbin motioned to him and, in answer to a last request, Willard lifted\nhim so he faced the port window for a final look at the panorama of the\nstars.\n\nDobbin's eyes, dimming and half closed, took in the vast play of the\nheavens and in his mind he relived the days when in a frail craft he\nfirst crossed interstellar space. But for Earth-loneliness Dobbin would\ndie a happy man, knowing that he had lived as much and as deeply as any\nman could.\n\nSilently the two men watched. Dobbin's eyes opened suddenly and a\ntremor seized his body. He turned painfully and looked at Willard.\n\n\"I saw it!\" his voice cracked, trembling.\n\n\"Saw what?\"\n\n\"It's true! It's true! It comes whenever a space man dies! It's there!\"\n\n\"In heaven's name, Dobbin,\" Willard demanded, \"What do you see? What is\nit?\"\n\nDobbin lifted his dark bony arm and pointed out into star-studded\nspace.\n\n\"The Ghost Ship!\"\n\nSomething clicked in Willard's memory. He had heard it spoken of in\nwhispers by drunken space men and professional tellers of fairy tales.\nBut he had never put any stock in them. In some forgotten corner of\nDobbin's mind the legend of the Ghost Ship must have lain, to come up\nin this time of delirium.\n\n\"There's nothing there,\" he said firmly.\n\n\"It's come--for me!\" Dobbin cried. He turned his head slowly toward\nWillard, tried to say something and then fell back upon the pillow. His\nmouth was open and his eyes stared unseeing ahead. Dobbin was now one\nwith the vanished pioneers of yesterday. Willard was alone.\n\nFor two days, reckoned in Earth time, Willard kept vigil over the body\nof his friend and space mate. When the time was up he did what was\nnecessary and nothing remained of Harry Dobbin, the best friend he had\never had. The atoms of his body were now pure energy stored away in the\nuseless motors of the _Mary Lou_.\n\n\n\nThe weeks that followed were like a blur in Willard's mind. Though the\nship was utterly incapable of motion, the chance meteor that damaged\nit had spared the convertors and assimilators. Through constant care\nand attention the frail balance that meant life or death could be kept.\nThe substance of waste and refuse was torn down and rebuilt as precious\nfood and air. It was even possible to create more than was needed.\n\nWhen this was done, Willard immediately regretted it. For it would be\nthen that the days and the weeks would roll by endlessly. Sometimes\nhe thought he would go mad when, sitting at the useless control\nboard, which was his habit, he would stare for hours and hours in\nthe direction of the Sun where he knew the Earth would be. A great\nloneliness would then seize upon him and an agony that no man had ever\nknown would tear at his heart. He would then turn away, full of despair\nand hopeless pain.\n\nTwo years after Dobbin's death a strange thing happened. Willard was\nsitting at his accustomed place facing the unmoving vista of the stars.\nA chance glance at Orion's belt froze him still. A star had flickered!\nDistinctly, as if a light veil had been placed over it and then lifted,\nit dimmed and turned bright again. What strange phenomena was this? He\nwatched and then another star faded momentarily in the exact fashion.\nAnd then a third! And a fourth! And a fifth!\n\nWillard's heart gave a leap and the lethargy of two years vanished\ninstantly. Here, at last, was something to do. It might be only a few\nminutes before he would understand what it was, but those few minutes\nwould help while away the maddening long hours. Perhaps it was a mass\nof fine meteorites or a pocket of gas that did not disperse, or even a\nmoving warp of space-light. Whatever it was, it was a phenomena worth\ninvestigating and Willard seized upon it as a dying man seizes upon the\nlast flashing seconds of life.\n\nWillard traced its course by the flickering stars and gradually plotted\nits semi-circular course. It was not from the solar system but,\ninstead, headed toward it. A rapid check-up on his calculations caused\nhis heart to beat in ever quickening excitement. Whatever it was, it\nwould reach the _Mary Lou_.\n\nAgain he looked out the port. Unquestionably the faint mass was nearing\nhis ship. It was round in shape and almost invisible. The stars,\nthough dimmed, could still be seen through it. There was something\nabout its form that reminded him of an old-fashioned rocket ship. It\nresembled one of those that had done pioneer service in the lanes forty\nyears ago or more. Resembled one? It was one! Unquestionably, though\nhalf-invisible and like a piece of glass immersed in water, it was a\nrocket ship.\n\nBut the instruments on the control board could not lie. The presence of\nany material body within a hundred thousand miles would be revealed.\nBut the needle on the gauge did not quiver. Nothing indicated the\npresence of a ship. But the evidence of his eyes was incontestable.\n\nOr was it? Doubt gripped him. Did the loneliness of all these years\nin space twist his mind till he was imagining the appearance of faint\nghost-like rocket ships?\n\nThe thought shot through his mind like a thunder bolt. Ghost Ship!\nWas this the thing that Dobbin had seen before he died? But that was\nimpossible. Ghost Ships existed nowhere but in legends and tall tales\ntold by men drunk with the liquors of Mars.\n\n\"There is no ship there. There is no ship there,\" Willard told himself\nover and over again as he looked at the vague outline of the ship, now\nmotionless a few hundred miles away.\n\nDeep within him a faint voice cried, \"_It's come--for me!_\" but Willard\nstilled it. This was no fantasy. There was a scientific reason for it.\nThere must be! Or should there be? Throughout all Earth history there\nhad been Ghost Ships sailing the Seven Seas--ships doomed to roam\nforever because their crew broke some unbreakable law. If this was true\nfor the ships of the seas, why not for the ships of empty space?\n\nHe looked again at the strange ship. It was motionless. At least it was\nnot nearing him. Willard could see nothing but its vague outline. A\nmoment later he could discern a faint motion. It was turning! The Ghost\nShip was turning back! Unconsciously Willard reached out with his hand\nas if to hold it back, for when it was gone he would be alone again.\n\nBut the Ghost Ship went on. Its outline became smaller and smaller,\nfainter and fainter.\n\nTrembling, Willard turned away from the window as he saw the rocket\nrecede and vanish into the emptiness of space. Once more the dreaded\nloneliness of the stars descended upon him.\n\n\n\nSeven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n\n\"_Arden, Rocketport_--Thirteen years ago the Space Ship _Mary Lou_\nunder John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n_Mary Lou II_, in memory of his father.\"\n\nMemories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n\nWillard, master and lone survivor of the _Mary Lou_, knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n\nAnd so it was that each night--for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time--Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n\nIn his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n\nAbove all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n\nClearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n\nGrimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n\nDoomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk--the Ghost will come--for you!\n\nAnd this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n\nAnother year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the _Mary Lou_. At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star _through_ the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n\nSince then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n\nHow many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n\n\n\nWillard awoke from a deep sleep and prepared his bed. He did it, not\nbecause it was necessary, but because it was a habit that had long been\ningrained in him through the years.\n\nHe checked and rechecked every part of the still functioning mechanism\nof the ship. The radio, even though there was no one to call, was in\nperfect order. The speed-recording dials, even though there was no\nspeed to record, were in perfect order. And so with every machine. All\nwas in perfect order. Perfect useless order, he thought bitterly, when\nthere was no way whatever to get sufficient power to get back to Earth,\nlong forgotten Earth.\n\nHe was leaning back in his chair when a vague uneasiness seized him.\nHe arose and slowly walked over to the window, his age already being\nmarked in the ache of his bones. Looking out into the silent theater of\nthe stars, he suddenly froze.\n\nThere was a ship, coming toward him!\n\nFor a moment the reason in his mind tottered on a balance. Doubt\nassailed him. Was this the Ghost Ship come to torment him again? But no\nphantom this! It was a life and blood rocket ship from Earth! Starlight\nshone on it and not through it! Its lines, window, vents were all solid\nand had none of the ghost-like quality he remembered seeing in the\nGhost Ship in his youth.\n\nFor another split second he thought that perhaps he, too, like Dobbin,\nhad gone mad and that the ship would vanish just as it approached him.\n\nThe tapping of the space-telegrapher reassured him.\n\n\"CALLING SPACE SHIP MARY LOU,\" the message rapped out, \"CALLING SPACE\nSHIP MARY LOU.\"\n\nWith trembling fingers that he could scarcely control, old Willard sent\nthe answering message.\n\n\"SPACE SHIP MARY LOU REPLYING. RECEIVED MESSAGE. THANK GOD!\"\n\nHe broke off, unable to continue. His heart was ready to burst within\nhim and the tears of joy were already welling in his eyes. He listened\nto the happiest message he had ever heard:\n\n\"NOTICE THAT SPACE SHIP MARY LOU IS DISABLED AND NOT SPACE WORTHY. YOU\nARE INVITED TO COME ABOARD. HAVE YOU SPACE SUIT AND--ARE YOU ABLE TO\nCOME?\"\n\nWillard, already sobbing with joy, could send only two words.\n\n\"YES! COMING!\"\n\nThe years of waiting were over. At last he was free of the _Mary Lou_.\nIn a dream like trance, he dressed in his space suit, pathetically\nglad that he had already checked every detail of it a short time ago.\nHe realized suddenly that everything about the _Mary Lou_ was hateful to\nhim. It was here that his best friend died, and it was here that twenty\nyears of his life were wasted completely in solitude and despair.\n\nHe took one last look and stepped into the air-lock.\n\nThe Earth-ship, he did not see its name, was only a hundred yards away\nand a man was already at the air-lock waiting to help him. A rope was\ntossed to him. He reached for it and made his way to the ship, leaving\nthe _Mary Lou_ behind him forever.\n\nSuddenly the world dropped away from him. Willard could neither see nor\nsay anything. His heart was choked with emotion.\n\n\"It's all right,\" a kindly voice assured him, \"You're safe now.\"\n\nHe had the sensation of being carried by several men and then placed in\nbed. The quiet of deep sleep descended upon him.\n\n\n\nHe woke many times in the following days, but the privations of the\npassing years had drained his strength and his mind, had made him so\nmuch of a hermit that the presence of other men frightened him to the\npoint of gibbering insanity.\n\nHe knew that the food and drink were drugged, for after eating he\nnever remembered seeing the men enter the room to care for him and to\nremove the dirty dishes. But there was enough sanity in his mind to\nalso realize that, without the gradual reawakening of his senses to the\nvalue of human companionship, he might not be able to stand the mental\nshock of moving about among his people back on Earth.\n\nDuring those passing days, he savored each new impression, comparing\nit with what he remembered from that age-long past when he and his\nfriends had walked on Earth's great plains and ridden on the oceans'\nsleek ships or flown with the wings of birds over the mountain ranges.\nAnd each impression was doubly enjoyable, for his memory was hazy and\nconfused.\n\nGradually, though, his mind cleared; he remembered the past, and he no\nlonger was afraid of the men who visited him from time to time. But\nthere was a strangeness about the men that he could not fathom; they\nrefused to talk about anything, any subject, other than the actual\nrunning of the great ship. Always, when he asked his eager questions,\nthey mumbled and drifted away.\n\nAnd then in his third week on the rescue ship, he went to sleep one\nnight while peering from the port hole at the blue ball of Earth\nswimming in the blackness of space. He slept and he dreamed of the\nyears he had spent by himself in the drifting, lifeless hulk of the\n_Mary Lou_. His dreams were vivid, peopled with men and women he had\nonce known, and were horrible with the fantasies of terror that years\nof solitary brooding had implanted deep in his mind.\n\n\n\nHe awoke with a start and a cry of alarm ran through him as he thought\nthat perhaps he might still be in the _Mary Lou_. The warm, smiling face\nof a man quickly reassured him.\n\n\"I'll call the captain,\" the space man said. \"He said to let him know\nwhen you came to.\"\n\nWillard could only nod in weak and grateful acceptance. It was true! He\npressed his head back against the bed's pillows. How soft! How warm! He\nyawned and stretched his arms as a thrill of happiness shot through his\nentire body.\n\nHe would see Earth again! That single thought ran over and over in his\nmind without stopping. He would see Earth again! Perhaps not this year\nand perhaps not the next--for the ship might be on some extra-Plutonian\nexpedition. But even if it would take years before it returned to home\nbase Willard knew that those years would fly quickly if Earth was at\nthe end of the trail.\n\nThough he had aged, he still had many years before him. And those\nyears, he vowed, would be spent on Earth and nowhere else.\n\nThe captain, a pleasant old fellow, came into the room as Willard stood\nup and tried to walk. The gravity here was a bit different from that of\nhis ship, but he would manage.\n\n\"How do you feel, Space Man Willard?\"\n\n\"Oh, you know me?\" Willard looked at him in surprise, and then smiled,\n\"Of course, you looked through the log book of the _Mary Lou_.\"\n\nThe captain nodded and Willard noticed with surprise that he was a very\nold man.\n\n\"You don't know how much I suffered there,\" Willard said slowly,\nmeasuring each word. \"Years in space--all alone! It's a horrible thing!\"\n\n\"Yes?\" the old captain said.\n\n\"Many times I thought I would go completely mad. It was only the\nthought and hope that some day, somehow, an Earth-ship would find me\nand help me get back to Earth. If it was not for that, I would have\ndied. I could think of nothing but of Earth, of blue green water, of\nvast open spaces and the good brown earth. How beautiful it must be\nnow!\"\n\nA note of sadness, matched only by that of Willard's, entered the\ncaptain's eyes.\n\n\"I want to walk on Earth just once--then I can die.\"\n\nWillard stopped. A happy dreamy smile touched his lips.\n\n\"When will we go to Earth?\" he asked.\n\nThe Captain did not answer. Willard waited and a strange memory tugged\nat him.\n\n\"You don't know,\" the Captain said. It was not a question or a\nstatement. The Captain found it hard to say it. His lips moved slowly.\n\nWillard stepped back and before the Captain told him, _he knew_.\n\n\"Matter is relative,\" he said, \"the existent under one condition is\nnon-existent under another. The real here is the non-real there. All\nthings that wander alone in space are gradually drained of their mass\nand energy until nothing is left but mere shells. That is what happened\nto the _Mary Lou_. Your ship was real when we passed by twenty years\nago. It is now like ours, a vague outline in space. We cannot feel\nthe change ourselves, for change is relative. That is why we became\nmore and more solid to you, as you became more and more faint to any\nEarth-ship that might have passed. We are real--to ourselves. But to\nsome ship from Earth which has not been in space for more than fifteen\nyears--to that ship, to all intents and purposes, we do not exist.\n\n\"Then this ship,\" Willard said, stunned, \"you and I and everything on\nit...\"\n\n\"... are doomed,\" the Captain said. \"We cannot go to Earth for the\nsimple reason that we would go _through_ it!\"\n\nThe vision of Earth and green trees faded. He would never see Earth\nagain. He would never feel the crunch of ground under feet as he\nwalked. Never would listen to the voices of friends and the songs of\nbirds. Never. Never. Never....\n\n\"Then this is the Ghost Ship and we are the Ghosts!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\n\n\n",
