    "body": "The Colonel was the idol of his bragging old regiment and of the\nbragging brigade which for the last six months he had commanded.\n\nHe was the idol, not because he was good and gracious, not because he\nspared his soldiers or treated them as fellow-citizens, but because he\nhad led them to victory and made them famous. If a man will win battles\nand give his brigade a right to brag loudly of its doings, he may have\nits admiration and even its enthusiastic devotion, though he be as\npitiless and as wicked as Lucifer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothin\u2019 to me what the Currnell is in prrivit, so long as he shows\nus how to whack the rrebs,\u201d said Major Gahogan, commandant of the \u201cOld\nTenth.\u201d \u201cMoses saw God in the burrnin\u2019 bussh, an\u2019 bowed down to it, an\u2019\nworr-shipt it. It wasn\u2019t the bussh he worrshipt; it was his God that\nwas in it. An\u2019 I worrship this villin of a Currnell (if he is a villin)\nbecause he\u2019s almighty and gives us the vict\u2019ry. He\u2019s nothin\u2019 but a human\nburrnin\u2019 bussh, perhaps, but he\u2019s got the god of war in um. Adjetant\nWallis, it\u2019s a------long time between dhrinks, as I think ye was\nsayin\u2019, an\u2019 with rayson. See if ye can\u2019t confiscate a canteen of whiskee\nsomewhere in the camp. Bedad, if I can\u2019t buy it I\u2019ll stale it. We\u2019re\ngoin\u2019 to fight tomorry, an\u2019 it may be it\u2019s the last chance we\u2019ll have\nfor a dhrink, unless there\u2019s more lik\u2019r now in the other worrld than\nDives got.\u201d\n\nThe brigade was bivouacked in some invisible region, amid the damp,\nmisty darkness of a September night. The men lay in their ranks, each\nwith his feet to the front and his head rearward, each covered by his\novercoat and pillowed upon his haversack, each with his loaded rifle\nnestled close beside him. Asleep as they were, or dropping placidly into\nslumber, they were ready to start in order to their feet and pour out\nthe red light and harsh roar of combat. There were two lines of battle,\neach of three regiments of infantry, the first some two hundred yards\nin advance of the second. In the space between them lay two four-gun\nbatteries, one of them brass twelve-pounder \u201cNapoleons,\u201d and the other\nrifled Parrotts. To the rear of the infantry were the recumbent troopers\nand picketed horses of a regiment of cavalry. All around, in the far,\nblack distance, invisible and inaudible, paced or watched stealthily the\nsentinels of the grand guards.\n\nThere was not a fire, not a torch, nor a star-beam in the whole bivouac\nto guide the feet of Adjutant Wallis in his pilgrimage after\nwhiskey. The orders from brigade headquarters had been strict against\nilluminations, for the Confederates were near at hand in force, and a\nsurprise was proposed as well as feared. A tired and sleepy youngster,\nalmost dropping with the heavy somnolence of wearied adolescence, he\nstumbled on through the trials of an undiscernible and unfamiliar\nfooting, lifting his heavy riding-boots sluggishly over imaginary\nobstacles, and fearing the while lest his toil were labor misspent. It\nwas a dry camp, he felt dolefully certain, or there would have been more\nnoise in it. He fell over a sleeping sergeant, and said to him hastily,\n\u201cSteady, man--a friend!\u201d as the half-roused soldier clutched his rifle.\nThen he found a lieutenant, and shook him in vain; further on a captain,\nand exchanged saddening murmurs with him; further still a camp-follower\nof African extraction, and blasphemed him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a God-forsaken camp, and there isn\u2019t a horn in it,\u201d said Adjutant\nWallis to himself as he pursued his groping journey. \u201cBet you I don\u2019t\nfind the first drop,\u201d he continued, for he was a betting boy, and\nfrequently argued by wagers, even with himself. \u201cBet you two to one I\ndon\u2019t. Bet you three to one--ten to one.\u201d\n\nThen he saw, an indefinite distance beyond him, burning like red-hot\niron through the darkness, a little scarlet or crimson gleam, as of a\nlighted cigar.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Old Grumps, of the Bloody Fourteenth,\u201d he thought. \u201cI\u2019ve raided\ninto his happy sleeping-grounds. I\u2019ll draw on him.\u201d\n\nBut Old Grumps, otherwise Colonel Lafayette Gildersleeve, had no\nrations--that is, no whiskey.\n\n\u201cHow do you suppose an officer is to have a drink, Lieutenant?\u201d he\ngrumbled. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that our would-be Brigadier sent all the\ncommissary to the rear day before yesterday? A eanteenful can\u2019t last two\ndays. Mine went empty about five minutes ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, thunder!\u201d groaned Wallis, saddened by that saddest of all thoughts,\n\u201cToo late!\u201d \u201cWell, least said soonest mended. I must wobble back to my\nMajor.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll send you off to some other camp as dry as this one. Wait ten\nminutes, and he\u2019ll be asleep. Lie down on my blanket and light your\npipe. I want to talk to you about official business--about our would-be\nBrigadier.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, _your_ turn will come some day,\u201d mumbled Wallis, remembering\nGildersleeve\u2019s jealousy of the brigade commander--a jealousy which only\ngave tongue when aroused by \u201ccommissary.\u201d \u201cIf you do as well as usual\nto-morrow you can have your own brigade.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose you think we are all going to do well to-morrow,\u201d scoffed Old\nGrumps, whose utterance by this time stumbled. \u201cI suppose you expect to\nwhip and to have a good time. I suppose you brag on fighting and enjoy\nit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like it well enough when it goes right; and it generally does go\nright with this brigade. I should like it better if the rebs would fire\nhigher and break quicker.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat depends on the way those are commanded whose business it is to\nbreak them,\u201d growled Old Grumps. \u201cI don\u2019t say but what we are rightly\ncommanded,\u201d he added, remembering his duty to superiors. \u201cI concede and\nacknowledge that our would-be Brigadier knows his military business. But\nthe blessing of God, Wallis! I believe in Waldron as a soldier. But as a\nman and a Christian, faugh!\u201d\n\nGildersleeve had clearly emptied his canteen unassisted; he never talked\nabout Christianity when perfectly sober.\n\n\u201cWhat was your last remark?\u201d inquired Wallis, taking his pipe from his\nmouth to grin. Even a superior officer might be chaffed a little in the\ndarkness.\n\n\u201cI made no last remark,\u201d asserted the Colonel with dignity. \u201cI\u2019m not\na-dying yet. If I said anything last it was a mere exclamation of\ndisgust--the disgust of an officer and gentleman. I suppose you know\nsomething about our would-be Brigadier. I suppose you think you know\nsomething about him.\u201d\n\n\u201cBet you I know _all_ about him,\u201d affirmed Wallis. \u201cHe enlisted in the\nOld Tenth as a common soldier. Before he had been a week in camp they\nfound that he knew his biz, and they made him a sergeant. Before we\nstarted for the field the Governor got his eye on him and shoved him\ninto a lieutenancy. The first battle h\u2019isted him to a captain. And\nthe second--bang! whiz! he shot up to colonel right over the heads of\neverybody, line and field. Nobody in the Old Tenth grumbled. They saw\nthat he knew his biz. I know _all_ about him. What\u2019ll you bet?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a betting man, Lieutenant, except in a friendly game of poker,\u201d\n sighed Old Grumps. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about your Brigadier,\u201d he\nadded in a sepulchral murmur, the echo of an empty canteen. \u201cI have only\nbeen in this brigade a month, and I know more than you do, far, very far\nmore, sorry to say it. He\u2019s a reformed clergyman. He\u2019s an apostatized\nminister.\u201d The Colonel\u2019s voice as he said this was solemn and sad enough\nto do credit to an undertaker. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad sort, Wallis,\u201d he continued,\nafter another deep sigh, a very highly perfumed one, the sigh of a\nbarkeeper. \u201cWhen a clergyman falls, he falls for life and eternity,\nlike a woman or an angel. I never knew a backslidden shepherd to come\nto good. Sooner or later he always goes to the devil, and takes down\nwhomsoever hangs to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll take down the Old Tenth, then,\u201d asserted Wallis. \u201cIt hangs to\nhim. Bet you two to one he takes it along.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, Adjutant; spoken like a soldier,\u201d swore Gildersleeve,\n\u201cAnd the Bloody Fourteenth, too. It will march into the burning pit as\nfar as any regiment; and the whole brigade, yes, sir! But a backslidden\nshepherd, my God! Have we come to that? I often say to myself, in the\nsolemn hours of the night, as I remember my Sabbath-school days, \u2018Great\nScott! have we come to that?\u2019 A reformed clergyman! An apostatized\nminister! Think of it, Wallis, think of it! Why, sir, his very wife ran\naway from him. They had but just buried their first boy,\u201d pursued Old\nGrumps, his hoarse voice sinking to a whimper. \u201cThey drove home from the\nburial-place, where lay the new-made grave. Arrived at their door, _he_\ngot out and extended his hand to help _her_ out. Instead of accepting,\ninstead of throwing herself into his arms and weeping there, she turned\nto the coachman and said, \u2018Driver, drive me to my father\u2019s house.\u2019 That\nwas the end of their wedded life, Wallis.\u201d\n\nThe Colonel actually wept at this point, and the maudlin tears were not\naltogether insincere. His own wife and children he heartily loved, and\nremembered them now with honest tenderness. At home he was not a drinker\nand a rough; only amid the hardships and perils of the field.\n\n\u201cThat was the end of it, Wallis,\u201d he repeated. \u201cAnd what was it while it\nlasted? What does a woman leave her husband for? Why does she separate\nfrom him over the grave of her innocent first-born? There are twenty\nreasons, but they must all of them be good ones. I am sorry to give it\nas my decided opinion, Wallis, in perfect confidence, that they must all\nbe whopping good ones. Well, that was the beginning; only the beginning.\nAfter that he held on for a while, breaking the bread of life to a\nskedaddling flock, and then he bolted. The next known of him, three\nyears later, he enlisted in your regiment, a smart but seedy recruit,\nsmelling strongly of whiskey.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I smelt half as strong of it myself,\u201d grumbled Wallis. \u201cIt might\nkeep out the swamp fever.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the true story of Col. John James Waldron,\u201d continued Old\nGrumps, with a groan which was very somnolent, as if it were a twin to a\nsnore. \u201cThat\u2019s the true story.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe the first word of it--that is to say, Colonel, I think\nyou have been misinformed--and I\u2019ll bet you two to one on it. If he was\nnothing more than a minister, how did he know drill and tactics?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I forgot to say he went through West Point--that is, nearly\nthrough. They graduated him in his third year by the back door, Wallis.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that was it, was it? He was a West Pointer, was he? Well, then, the\nbacksliding was natural, and oughtn\u2019t to count against him. A member of\nBenny Haven\u2019s church has a right to backslide anywhere, especially as\nthe Colonel doesn\u2019t seem to be any worse than some of the rest of us,\nwho haven\u2019t fallen from grace the least particle, but took our stand at\nthe start just where we are now. A fellow that begins with a handful of\ntrumps has a right to play a risky game.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what euchered him, Wallis. It was the old Little Joker; and\nthere\u2019s another of the same on hand now.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn hand where? What are you driving at, Colonel?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe looks like a boy. I mean she looks like a boy. You know what I\nmean, Wallis; I mean the boy that makes believe to wait on him. And\nher brother is in camp, got here to-night. There\u2019ll be an explanation\nto-morrow, and there\u2019ll be bloodshed.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood-night, Colonel, and sleep it off,\u201d said Wallis, rising from\nthe side of a man whom he believed to be sillily drunk and altogether\nuntrustworthy. \u201cYou know we get after the rebs at dawn.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know it--goo-night, Adjutant--gawbless-you,\u201d mumbled Old Grumps.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll lick those rebs, won\u2019t we?\u201d he chuckled. \u201cGoo-night, ole fellow,\nan\u2019 gawblessyou.\u201d\n\nWhereupon Old Grumps fell asleep, very absurdly overcome by liquor, we\nextremely regret to concede, but nobly sure to do his soldierly duty as\nsoon as he should awake.\n\nStumbling wearily blanketward, Wallis found his Major and regimental\ncommander, the genial and gallant Gahogan, slumbering in a peace like\nthat of the just. He stretched himself anear, put out his hand to touch\nhis sabre and revolver, drew his caped great-coat over him, moved once\nto free his back of a root or pebble, glanced languidly at a single\nstruggling star, thought for an instant of his far-away mother, turned\nhis head with a sigh and slept. In the morning he was to fight, and\nperhaps to die; but the boyish veteran was too seasoned, and also too\ntired, to mind that; he could mind but one thing--nature\u2019s pleading for\nrest.\n\nIn the iron-gray dawn, while the troops were falling dimly and\nspectrally into line, and he was mounting his horse to be ready for\norders, he remembered Gildersleeve\u2019s drunken tale concerning the\ncommandant, and laughed aloud. But turning his face toward brigade\nheadquarters (a sylvan region marked out by the branches of a great\noak), he was surprised to see a strange officer, a fair young man in\ncaptain\u2019s uniform, riding slowly toward it.\n\n\u201cIs that the boy\u2019s brother?\u201d he said to himself; and in the next instant\nhe had forgotten the whole subject; it was time to form and present the\nregiment.\n\nQuietly and without tap of drum the small, battle-worn battalions filed\nout of their bivouacs into the highway, ordered arms and waited for\nthe word to march. With a dull rumble the field-pieces trundled slowly\nafter, and halted in rear of the infantry. The cavalry trotted off\ncircuitously through the fields, emerged upon a road in advance and\nlikewise halted, all but a single company, which pushed on for half a\nmile, spreading out as it went into a thin line of skirmishers.\n\nMeanwhile a strange interview took place near the great oak which had\nsheltered brigade headquarters. As the unknown officer, whom Wallis had\nnoted, approached it, Col. Waldron was standing by his horse ready\nto mount. The commandant was a man of medium size, fairly handsome in\nperson and features, and apparently about twenty-eight years of age.\nPerhaps it was the singular breadth of his forehead which made the lower\npart of his face look so unusually slight and feminine. His eyes were\ndark hazel, as clear, brilliant, and tender as a girl\u2019s, and brimming\nfull of a pensiveness which seemed both loving and melancholy. Few\npersons, at all events few women, who looked upon him ever looked beyond\nhis eyes. They were very fascinating, and in a man\u2019s countenance very\nstrange. They were the kind of eyes which reveal passionate romances,\nand which make them.\n\nBy his side stood a boy, a singularly interesting and beautiful boy,\nfair-haired and blue-eyed, and delicate in color. When this boy saw\nthe stranger approach he turned as pale as marble, slid away from\nthe brigade commander\u2019s side, and disappeared behind a group of staff\nofficers and orderlies. The new-comer also became deathly white as he\nglanced after the retreating youth. Then he dismounted, touched his\ncap slightly and, as if mechanically, advanced a few steps, and said\nhoarsely, \u201cI believe this is Colonel Waldron. I am Captain Fitz Hugh, of\nthe --th Delaware.\u201d\n\nWaldron put his hand to his revolver, withdrew it instantaneously, and\nstood motionless.\n\n\u201cI am on leave of absence from my regiment, Colonel,\u201d continued Fitz\nHugh, speaking now with an elaborate ceremoniousness of utterance\nsignificant of a struggle to suppress violent emotion. \u201cI suppose you\ncan understand why I made use of it in seeking you.\u201d\n\nWaldron hesitated; he stood gazing at the earth with the air of one who\nrepresses deep pain; at last, after a profound sigh, he raised his eyes\nand answered:\n\n\u201cCaptain, we are on the eve of a battle. I must attend to my public\nduties first. After the battle we will settle our private affair.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is but one way to settle it, Colonel.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shall have your way if you will. You shall do what you will. I only\nask what good will it do to _her?_\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will do good to _me_, Colonel,\u201d whispered Fitz Hugh, suddenly\nturning crimson. \u201cYou forget _me_.\u201d\n\nWaldron\u2019s face also flushed, and an angry sparkle shot from under\nhis lashes in reply to this utterance of hate, but it died out in an\ninstant.\n\n\u201cI have done a wrong, and I will accept the consequences,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI pledge you my word that I will be at your disposal if I survive the\nbattle. Where do you propose to remain meanwhile?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will take the same chance, sir. I propose to do my share in the\nfighting if you will use me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am short of staff officers. Will you act as my aid?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will, Colonel,\u201d bowed Fitz Hugh, with a glance which expressed\nsurprise, and perhaps admiration, at this confidence.\n\nWaldron turned, beckoned his staff officers to approach, and said,\n\u201cGentlemen, this is Captain Fitz Hugh of the --th Delaware. He has\nvolunteered to join us for the day, and will act as my aid. And now,\nCaptain, will you ride to the head of the column and order it forward?\nThere will be no drum-beat and no noise. When you have given your order\nand seen it executed, you will wait for me.\u201d\n\nFitz Hugh saluted, sprang into his saddle and galloped away. A few\nminutes later the whole column was plodding on silently toward\nits bloody goal. To a civilian, unaccustomed to scenes of war, the\ntranquillity of these men would have seemed very wonderful. Many of the\nsoldiers were still munching the hard bread and raw pork of their meagre\nbreakfasts, or drinking the cold coffee with which they had filled their\ncanteens the day previous. Many more were chatting in an undertone,\ngrumbling over their sore feet and other discomfits, chaffing each\nother, and laughing. The general bearing, however, was grave, patient,\nquietly enduring, and one might almost say stolid. You would have said,\nto judge by their expressions, that these sunburned fellows were merely\ndoing hard work, and thoroughly commonplace work, without a prospect of\nadventure, and much less of danger. The explanation of this calmness, so\nbrutal perhaps to the eye of a sensitive soul, lies mainly in the fact\nthat they were all veterans, the survivors of marches, privations,\nmaladies, sieges, and battles. Not a regiment present numbered four\nhundred men, and the average was not above three hundred. The\nwhole force, including artillery and cavalry, might have been about\ntwenty-five hundred sabres and bayonets.\n\nAt the beginning of the march Waldron fell into the rear of his staff\nand mounted orderlies. Then the boy who had fled from Fitz Hugh dropped\nout of the tramping escort, and rode up to his side.\n\n\u201cWell, Charlie,\u201d said Waldron, casting a pitying glance at the yet\npallid face and anxious eyes of the youth, \u201cyou have had a sad fright. I\nmake you very miserable.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has found us at last,\u201d murmured Charlie in a tremulous soprano\nvoice. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are to talk to-morrow. He acts as my aide-de-camp to-day. I ought to\ntell you frankly that he is not friendly.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, I knew it,\u201d sighed Charlie, while the tears fell.\n\n\u201cIt is only one more trouble--one more danger, and perhaps it may pass.\nSo many _have_ passed.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you tell him anything to quiet him? Did you tell him that we were\nmarried?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we are not married yet, Charlie. We shall be, I hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you ought to have told him that we were. It might stop him from\ndoing something--mad. Why didn\u2019t you tell him so? Why didn\u2019t you think\nof it?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear little child, we are about to have a battle. I should like to\ncarry some honor and truth into it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d continued Charlie, unconvinced and unappeased. \u201cI want to\nsee him. Is he at the head of the column? I want to speak to him, just\none word. He won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d\n\nShe suddenly spurred her horse, wheeled into the fields, and dashed\nonward. Fitz Hugh was lounging in his saddle, and sombrely surveying the\npassing column, when she galloped up to him.\n\n\u201cCarrol!\u201d she said, in a choked voice, reining in by his side, and\nleaning forward to touch his sleeve.\n\nHe threw one glance at her--a glance of aversion, if not of downright\nhatred, and turned his back in silence.\n\n\u201cHe is my husband, Carrol,\u201d she went on rapidly. \u201cI knew you didn\u2019t\nunderstand it. I ought to have written you about it. I thought I would\ncome and tell you before you did anything absurd. We were married as\nsoon as he heard that his wife was dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the use of this?\u201d he muttered hoarsely. \u201cShe is not dead. I\nheard from her a week ago. She was living a week ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Carrol!\u201d stammered Charlie. \u201cIt was some mistake then. Is it\npossible! And he was so sure! But he can get a divorce, you know. She\nabandoned him. Or _she_ can get one. No, _he_ can get it--of course,\nwhen she abandoned him. But, Carrol, she _must_ be dead--he was _so_\nsure.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is _not_ dead, I tell you. And there can be no divorce. Insanity\nbars all claim to a divorce. She is in an asylum. She had to leave him,\nand then she went mad.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no, Carrol, it is all a mistake; it is not so. Carrol,\u201d she\nmurmured in a voice so faint that he could not help glancing at her,\nhalf in fury and half in pity. She was slowly falling from her horse.\nHe sprang from his saddle, caught her in his arms, and laid her on the\nturf, wishing the while that it covered her grave. Just then one of\nWaldron\u2019s orderlies rode up and exclaimed: \u201cWhat is the matter with\nthe--the boy? Hullo, Charlie.\u201d\n\nFitz Hugh stared at the man in silence, tempted to tear him from his\nhorse. \u201cThe boy is ill,\u201d he answered when he recovered his self-command.\n\u201cTake charge of him yourself.\u201d He remounted, rode onward out of sight\nbeyond a thicket, and there waited for the brigade commander, now and\nthen fingering his revolver. As Charlie was being placed in an ambulance\nby the orderly and a sergeant\u2019s wife, Waldron came up, reined in his\nhorse violently, and asked in a furious voice, \u201cIs that boy hurt?\n\n\u201cAh--fainted,\u201d he added immediately. \u201cThank you, Mrs. Gunner. Take good\ncare of him--the best of care, my dear woman, and don\u2019t let him leave\nyou all day.\u201d\n\nFurther on, when Fitz Hugh silently fell into his escort, he merely\nglanced at him in a furtive way, and then cantered on rapidly to the\nhead of the cavalry. There he beckoned to the tall, grave, iron-gray\nChaplain of the Tenth, and rode with him for nearly an hour, apart,\nengaged in low and seemingly impassioned discourse. From this interview\nMr. Colquhoun returned to the escort with a strangely solemnized, tender\ncountenance, while the commandant, with a more cheerful air than he had\nyet worn that day, gave himself to his martial duties, inspecting the\nlandscape incessantly with his glass, and sending frequently for news\nto the advance scouts. It may properly be stated here that the Chaplain\nnever divulged to any one the nature of the conversation which he had\nheld with his Colonel.\n\nNothing further of note occurred until the little army, after two hours\nof plodding march, wound through a sinuous, wooded ravine, entered a\nbroad, bare, slightly undulating valley, and for the second time halted.\nWaldron galloped to the summit of a knoll, pointed to a long eminence\nwhich faced him some two miles distant, and said tranquilly, \u201cThere is\nour battle-ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that the enemy\u2019s position?\u201d returned Captain Ives, his\nadjutant-general. \u201cWe shall have a tough job if we go at it from here.\u201d\n\nWaldron remained in deep thought for some minutes, meanwhile scanning\nthe ridge and all its surroundings.\n\n\u201cWhat I want to know,\u201d he observed, at last, \u201cis whether they have\noccupied the wooded knolls in front of their right and around their\nright flank.\u201d\n\nShortly afterward the commander of the scout ing squadron came riding\nback at a furious pace.\n\n\u201cThey are on the hill, Colonel,\u201d he shouted.\n\n\u201cYes, of course,\u201d nodded Waldron; \u201cbut have they occupied the woods\nwhich veil their right front and flank?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a bit of it; my fellows have cantered all through, and up to the\nbase of the hill.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d exclaimed the brigade commander, with a rush of elation. \u201cThen it\nwill be easy work. Go back, Captain, and scatter your men through\nthe wood, and hold it, if possible. Adjutant, call up the regimental\ncommanders at once. I want them to understand my plan fully.\u201d\n\nIn a few minutes, Gahogan, of the Tenth; Gildersleeve, of the\nFourteenth; Peck, of the First; Thomas, of the Seventh; Taylor, of the\nEighth, and Colburn, of the Fifth, were gathered around their commander.\nThere, too, was Bradley, the boyish, red-cheeked chief of the artillery;\nand Stilton, the rough, old, bearded regular, who headed the cavalry.\nThe staff was at hand, also, including Fitz Hugh, who sat his horse a\nlittle apart, downcast and sombre and silent, but nevertheless keenly\ninterested. It is worthy of remark, by the way, that Waldron took\nno special note of him, and did not seem conscious of any disturbing\npresence. Evil as the man may have been, he was a thoroughly good\nsoldier, and just now he thought but of his duties.\n\n\u201cGentlemen,\u201d he said, \u201cI want you to see your field of battle. The enemy\noccupy that long ridge. How shall we reach it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think, if we got at it straight from here, we shan\u2019t miss it,\u201d\n promptly judged Old Grumps, his red-oak countenance admirably cheerful\nand hopeful, and his jealousy all dissolved in the interest of\napproaching combat.\n\n\u201cNor they won\u2019t miss us nuther,\u201d laughed Major Gahogan. \u201cBetther slide\nour infantree into thim wuds, push up our skirmishers, play wid our guns\nfor an hour, an\u2019 thin rowl in a couple o\u2019 col\u2019ms.\u201d\n\nThere was a general murmur of approval. The limits of volunteer\ninvention in tactics had been reached by Gahogan. The other regimental\ncommanders looked upon him as their superior in the art of war.\n\n\u201cThat would be well, Major, if we could do nothing better,\u201d said\nWaldron. \u201cBut I do not feel obliged to attack the front seriously\nat all. The rebels have been thoughtless enough to leave that long\nsemicircle of wooded knolls unoccupied, even by scouts. It stretches\nfrom the front of their centre clear around their right flank. I shall\nuse it as a veil to cover us while we get into position. I shall throw\nout a regiment, a battery, and five companies of cavalry, to make a\nfeint against their centre and left. With the remainder of the brigade\nI shall skirt the woods, double around the right of the position, and\nclose in upon it front and rear.\u201d\n\n\u201cLoike scissors blades upon a snip o\u2019 paper,\u201d shouted Gahogan, in\ndelight. Then he turned to Fitz Hugh, who happened to be nearest him,\nand added, \u201cI tell ye he\u2019s got the God o\u2019 War in um. He\u2019s the burnin\u2019\nbussh of humanity, wid a God o\u2019 Battles inside on\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how if they come down on our thin right wing?\u201d asked a cautious\nofficer, Taylor, of the Eighth. \u201cThey might smash it and seize our line\nof retreat.\u201d\n\n\u201cMen who have taken up a strong position, a position obviously chosen\nfor defence, rarely quit it promptly for an attack,\u201d replied Waldron.\n\u201cThere is not one chance in ten that these gentlemen will make a\nconsiderable forward movement early in the fight. Only the greatest\ngeniuses jump from the defensive to the offensive. Besides, we must hold\nthe wood. So long as we hold the wood in front of their centre we save\nthe road.\u201d\n\nThen came personal and detailed instructions. Each regimental commander\nwas told whither he should march, the point where he should halt to\nform line, and the direction by which he should attack. The mass of\nthe command was to advance in marching column toward a knoll where the\nhighway entered and traversed the wood. Some time before reaching\nit Taylor was to deploy the Eighth to the right, throw out a strong\nskirmish line and open fire on the enemy\u2019s centre and left, supported by\nthe battery of Parrotts, and, if pushed, by five companies of cavalry.\nThe remaining troops would reach the knoll, file to the left under cover\nof the forest, skirt it for a mile as rapidly as possible, infold the\nright of the Confederate position, and then move upon it concentrically.\nCounting from the left, the Tenth, the Seventh, and the Fourteenth were\nto constitute the first line of battle, while five companies of cavalry,\nthen the First, and then the Fifth formed the second line. Not until\nGahogan might have time to wind into the enemy\u2019s right rear should\nGildersleeve move out of the wood and commence the real attack.\n\n\u201cYou will go straight at the front of their right,\u201d said Waldron, with\na gay smile, to this latter Colonel. \u201cSend up two companies as\nskirmishers. The moment they are clearly checked, lead up the other\neight in line. It will be rough work. But keep pushing. You won\u2019t have\nfifteen minutes of it before Thomas, on your left, will be climbing the\nend of the ridge to take the rebels in flank. In fifteen minutes more\nGahogan will be running in on their backs. Of course, they will try to\nchange front and meet us. But they have extended their line a long way\nin order to cover the whole ridge. They will not be quick enough. We\nshall get hold of their right, and we shall roll them up. Then, Colonel\nStilton, I shall expect to see the troopers jumping into the gaps and\nmaking prisoners.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, Colonel,\u201d answered Stilton in that hoarse growl which is apt\nto mark the old cavalry officer. \u201cWhere shall we find you if we want a\nfresh order?\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall be with Colburn, in rear of Gildersleeve. That is our centre.\nBut never mind me; you know what the battle is to be, and you know how\nto fight it. The whole point with the infantry is to fold around the\nenemy\u2019s right, go in upon it concentrically, smash it, and roll up their\nline. The cavalry will watch against the infantry being flanked, and\nwhen the latter have seized the hill, will charge for prisoners. The\nartillery will reply to the enemy\u2019s guns with shell, and fire grape at\nany offensive demonstration. You all know your duties, now, gentlemen.\nGo to your commands, and march!\u201d\n\nThe colonels saluted and started off at a gallop. In a few minutes\ntwenty-five hundred men were in simultaneous movement. Five companies of\ncavalry wheeled into column of companies, and advanced at a trot through\nthe fields, seeking to gain the shelter of the forest. The six infantry\nregiments slid up alongside of each other, and pushed on in six parallel\ncolumns of march, two on the right of the road and four on the left. The\nartillery, which alone left the highway, followed at a distance of two\nor three hundred yards. The remaining cavalry made a wide detour to the\nright as if to flank the enemy\u2019s left.\n\nIt was a mile and a quarter--it was a march of fully twenty minutes--to\nthe edge of the woodland, the proposed cover of the column. Ten minutes\nbefore this point was reached a tiny puff of smoke showed on the brow of\nthe hostile ridge; then, at an interval of several seconds, followed the\nsound of a distant explosion; then, almost immediately, came the screech\nof a rifled shell. Every man who heard it swiftly asked himself, \u201cWill\nit strike _me?_\u201d But even as the words were thought out it had passed,\nhigh in air, clean to the rear, and burst harmlessly. A few faces turned\nupward and a few eyes glanced backward, as if to see the invisible\nenemy. But there was no pause in the column; it flowed onward quietly,\neagerly, and with business-like precision; it gave forth no sound but\nthe trampling of feet and the muttering of the officers. \u201cSteady, men!\nFor-ward, men!\u201d\n\nThe Confederates, however, had got their range. A half minute later four\npuffs of smoke dotted the ridge, and a flight of hoarse humming shrieks\ntore the air. A little aureole cracked and splintered over the First,\nfollowed by loud cries of anguish and a brief, slight confusion. The\nvoice of an officer rose sharply out of the flurry, \u201cClose up, Company\nA! Forward, men!\u201d The battalion column resumed its even formation in an\ninstant, and tramped unitedly onward, leaving behind it two quivering\ncorpses and a wounded man who tottered rearward.\n\nThen came more screeches, and a shell exploded over the highroad,\nknocking a gunner lifeless from his carriage. The brigade commander\nglanced anxiously along his batteries, and addressed a few words to his\nchief of artillery. Presently the four Napoleons set forward at a gallop\nfor the wood, while the four Parrotts wheeled to the right, deployed,\nand advanced across the fields, inclining toward the left of the enemy.\nNext Taylor\u2019s regiment (the Eighth) halted, fronted, faced to the right,\nand filed off in column of march at a double-quick until it had gained\nthe rear of the Parrotts, when it fronted again, and pushed on in\nsupport. A quarter of a mile further on these guns went into battery\nbehind the brow of a little knoll, and opened fire. Four companies\nof the Eighth spread out to the right as skirmishers, and commenced\nstealing toward the ridge, from time to time measuring the distance with\nrifle-balls. The remainder of the regiment lay down in line between\nthe Parrotts and the forest. Far away to the right, five companies of\ncavalry showed themselves, manoeuvring as if they proposed to turn the\nleft flank of the Southerners. The attack on this side was in form and\nin operation.\n\nMeantime the Confederate fire had divided. Two guns pounded away at\nTaylor\u2019s feint, while two shelled the main column. The latter was struck\nrepeatedly; more than twenty men dropped silent or groaning out of\nthe hurrying files; but the survivors pushed on without faltering and\nwithout even caring for the wounded. At last a broad belt of green\nbranches rose between the regiments and the ridge; and the rebel\ngunners, unable to see their foe, dropped suddenly into silence.\n\nHere it appeared that the road divided. The highway traversed the\nforest, mounted the slope beyond and dissected the enemy\u2019s position,\nwhile a branch road turned to the left and skirted the exterior of the\nlong curve of wooded hillocks. At the fork the battery of Napoleons had\nhalted, and there it was ordered to remain for the present in quiet.\nThere, too, the Fourteenth filed in among the dense greenery, threw out\ntwo companies of skirmishers toward the ridge, and pushed slowly after\nthem into the shadows.\n\n\u201cGet sight of the enemy at once!\u201d was Wal-dron\u2019s last word to\nGildersleeve. \u201cIf they move down the slope, drive them back. But don\u2019t\ncommence your attack under half an hour.\u201d\n\nNext he filed the Fifth to the thickets, saying to Colburn, \u201cI want you\nto halt a hundred yards to the left and rear of Gildersleeve. Cover his\nflank if he is attacked; but otherwise lie quiet. As soon as he charges,\nmove forward to the edge of the wood, and be ready to support him. But\nmake no assault yourself until further orders.\u201d\n\nThe next two regiments--the Seventh and First--he placed in _\u00e9chelon_,\nin like manner, a quarter of a mile further along. Then he galloped\nforward to the cavalry, and a last word with Stilton. \u201cYou and Gahogan\nmust take care of yourselves. Push on four or five hundred yards, and\nthen face to the right. Whatever Gahogan finds let him go at it. If he\ncan\u2019t shake it, help him. You two _must_ reach the top of the ridge.\nOnly, look out for your left flank. Keep a squadron or two in reserve on\nthat side.\u201d\n\n\u201cCurrnel, if we don\u2019t raich the top of the hill, it\u2019ll be because\nit hasn\u2019t got wan,\u201d answered Gahogan. Stilton only laughed and rode\nforward.\n\nWaldron now returned toward the fork of the road. On the way he sent a\nstaff officer to the Seventh with renewed orders to attack as soon as\npossible after Gildersleeve. Then another staff officer was hurried\nforward to Taylor with directions to push his feint strongly, and drive\nhis skirmishers as far up the slope as they could get. A third staff\nofficer set the Parrotts in rear of Taylor to firing with all their\nmight. By the time that the commandant had returned to Col-burn\u2019s\nambushed ranks, no one was with him but his enemy, Fitz Hugh.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to trust me with duty, Colonel,\u201d said the young man.\n\n\u201cI shall use you only in case of extremity, Captain,\u201d replied Waldron.\n\u201cWe have business to settle to-morrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ask no favors on that account. I hope you will offer me none.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn case of need I shall spare no one,\u201d declared Waldron.\n\nThen he took out his watch, looked at it impatiently, put it to his ear,\nrestored it to his pocket, and fell into an attitude of deep attention.\nEvidently his whole mind was on his battle, and he was waiting,\nwatching, yearning for its outburst.\n\n\u201cIf he wins this fight,\u201d thought Fitz Hugh, \u201chow can I do him a harm?\nAnd yet,\u201d he added, \u201chow can I help it?\u201d\n\nMinutes passed. Fitz Hugh tried to think of his injury, and to steel\nhimself against his chief. But the roar of battle on the right, and the\nsuspense and imminence of battle on the left, absorbed the attention of\neven this wounded and angry spirit, as, indeed, they might have\nabsorbed that of any being not more or less than human. A private wrong,\ninsupportable though it might be, seemed so small amid that deadly\nclamor and awful expectation! Moreover, the intellect which worked so\ncalmly and vigorously by his side, and which alone of all things near\nappeared able to rule the coming crisis, began to dominate him, in spite\nof his sense of injury. A thought crossed him to the effect that the\ngreat among men are too valuable to be punished for their evil deeds.\nHe turned to the absorbed brigade commander, now not only his ruler,\nbut even his protector, with a feeling that he must accord him a word\nof peace, a proffer in some form of possible forgiveness and friendship.\nBut the man\u2019s face was clouded and stern with responsibility and\nauthority. He seemed at that moment too lofty to be approached with a\nmessage of pardon. Fitz Hugh gazed at him with a mixture of prof ound\nrespect and smothered hate. He gazed, turned away, and remained silent.\n\nMinutes more passed. Then a mounted orderly dashed up at full speed,\nwith the words, \u201cColonel, Major Gahogan has fronted.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas he?\u201d answered Waldron, with a smile which thanked the trooper and\nmade him happy. \u201cRide on through the thicket here, my man, and tell\nColonel Gildersleeve to push up his skirmishers.\u201d\n\nWith a thud of hoofs and a rustling of parting foliage the cavalryman\ndisappeared amid the underwood. A minute or two later a thin, dropping\nrattle of musketry, five hundred yards or so to the front, announced\nthat the sharpshooters of the Fourteenth were at work. Almost\nimmediately there was an angry response, full of the threatenings and\nexecution of death. Through the lofty leafage tore the screech of a\nshell, bursting with a sharp crash as it passed overhead, and scattering\nin humming slivers. Then came another, and another, and many more,\nchasing each other with hoarse hissings through the trembling air, a\nsuccession of flying serpents. The enemy doubtless believed that nearly\nthe whole attacking force was massed in the wood around the road, and\nthey had brought at least four guns to bear upon that point, and were\nworking them with the utmost possible rapidity. Presently a large\nchestnut, not fifty yards from Fitz Hugh, was struck by a shot. The\nsolid trunk, nearly three feet in diameter, parted asunder as if it were\nthe brittlest of vegetable matter. The upper portion started aside with\na monstrous groan, dropped in a standing posture to the earth, and then\ntoppled slowly, sublimely prostrate, its branches crashing and all its\nleaves wailing. Ere long, a little further to the front, another Anak of\nthe forest went down; and, mingled with the noise of its sylvan agony,\nthere arose sharp cries of human suffering. Then Colonel Colburn, a\nbroad-chested and ruddy man of thirty-five, with a look of indignant\nanxiety in his iron-gray eyes, rode up to the brigade commander.\n\n\u201cThis is very annoying, Colonel,\u201d he said. \u201cI am losing my men without\nusing them. That last tree fell into my command.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre they firing toward our left?\u201d asked Waldron.\n\n\u201cNot a shot.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good,\u201d said the chief, with a sigh of contentment. \u201cIf we can only\nkeep them occupied in this direction! By the way, let your men lie down\nunder the fallen tree, as far as it will go. It will protect them from\nothers.\u201d\n\nColburn rode back to his regiment. Waldron looked impatiently at his\nwatch. At that moment a fierce burst of line firing arose in front,\nfollowed and almost overborne by a long-drawn yell, the scream of\ncharging men. Waldron put up his watch, glanced excitedly at Fitz Hugh,\nand smiled.\n\n\u201cI must forgive or forget,\u201d the latter could not help saying to himself.\n\u201cAll the rest of life is nothing compared with this.\u201d\n\n\u201cCaptain,\u201d said Waldron, \u201cride off to the left at full speed. As soon as\nyou hear firing at the shoulder of the ridge, return instantly and let\nme know.\u201d\n\nFitz Hugh dashed away. Three minutes carried him into perfect peace,\nbeyond the whistling of ball or the screeching of shell. On the right\nwas a tranquil, wide waving of foliage, and on the left a serene\nlandscape of cultivated fields, with here and there an embowered\nfarm-house. Only for the clamor of artillery and musketry far behind\nhim, he could not have believed in the near presence of battle, of blood\nand suffering and triumphant death. But suddenly he heard to his right,\nassaulting and slaughtering the tranquillity of nature, a tumultuous\noutbreak of file firing, mingled with savage yells. He wheeled, drove\nspurs into his horse, and flew back to Waldron. As he re-entered the\nwood he met wounded men streaming through it, a few marching alertly\nupright, many more crouching and groaning, some clinging to their less\ninjured comrades, but all haggard in face and ghastly.\n\n\u201cAre we winning?\u201d he hastily asked of one man who held up a hand with\nthree fingers gone and the bones projecting in sharp spikes through\nmangled flesh.\n\n\u201cAll right, sir; sailing in,\u201d was the answer.\n\n\u201cIs the brigade commander all right?\u201d he inquired of another who was\nwinding a bloody handkerchief around his arm.\n\n\u201cStraight ahead, sir; hurrah for Waldron!\u201d responded the soldier, and\nalmost in the same instant fell lifeless with a fresh ball through his\nhead.\n\n\u201cHurrah for him!\u201d Fitz Hugh answered frantically, plunging on through\nthe underwood. He found Waldron with Colburn, the two conversing\ntranquilly in their saddles amid hissing bullets and dropping branches.\n\n\u201cMove your regiment forward now,\u201d the brigade commander was saying; \u201cbut\nhalt it in the edge of the wood.\u201d\n\n\u201cShan\u2019t I relieve Gildersleeve if he gets beaten?\u201d asked the subordinate\nofficer eagerly.\n\n\u201cNo. The regiments on the left will help him out. I want your men and\nPeck\u2019s for the fight on top of the hill. Of course the rebels will try\nto retake it; then I shall call for you.\u201d\n\nFitz Hugh now approached and said, \u201cColonel, the Seventh has attacked in\nforce.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d answered Waldron, with that sweet smile of his which thanked\npeople who brought him pleasant news. \u201cI thought I heard his fire.\nGahogan will be on their right rear in ten minutes. Then we shall get\nthe ridge. Ride back now to Major Bradley, and tell him to bring his\nNapoleons through the wood, and set two of them to shelling the enemy\u2019s\ncentre. Tell him my idea is to amuse them, and keep them from changing\nfront.\u201d\n\nAgain Fitz Hugh galloped off as before on a comfortably safe errand,\nsafer at all events than many errands of that day. \u201cThis man is sparing\nmy life,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cWould to God I knew how to spare his!\u201d\n\nHe found Bradley lunching on a gun caisson, and delivered his orders.\n\u201cSomething to do at last, eh?\u201d laughed the rosy-cheeked youngster. \u201cThe\nsmallest favors thankfully received. Won\u2019t you take a bite of rebel\nchicken, Captain? This rebellion must be put down. No? Well, tell the\nColonel I am moving on, and John Brown\u2019s soul not far ahead.\u201d\n\nWhen Fitz Hugh returned to Waldron he found him outside of the wood, at\nthe base of the long incline which rose into the rebel position. About\nthe slope were scattered prostrate forms, most numerous near the bottom,\nsome crawling slowly rearward, some quiescent. Under the brow of the\nridge, decimated and broken into a mere skirmish line sheltered in knots\nand singly, behind rocks and knolls, and bushes, lay the Fourteenth\nRegiment, keeping up a steady, slow fire. From the edge above, smokily\ndim against a pure, blue heaven, answered another rattle of musketry,\nincessant, obstinate, and spiteful. The combatants on both sides were\nlying down; otherwise neither party could have lasted ten minutes. From\nFitz Hugh\u2019s point of view not a Confederate uniform could be seen. But\nthe smoke of their rifles made a long gray line, which was disagreeably\nvisible and permanent; and the sharp _whit! whit!_ of their bullets\ncontinually passed him, and cheeped away in the leafage behind.\n\n\u201cOur men can\u2019t get on another inch,\u201d he ventured to say to his\ncommander. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be well for me to ride up and say a cheering\nword?\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery battle consists largely in waiting,\u201d replied Waldron\nthoughtfully. \u201cThey have undoubtedly brought up a reserve to face\nThomas. But when Gahogan strikes the flank of the reserve, we shall\nwin.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish you would take shelter,\u201d begged Fitz Hugh. \u201cEverything depends\non your life.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy life has been both a help and a hurt to my fellow-creatures,\u201d sighed\nthe brigade commander. \u201cLet come what will to it.\u201d\n\nHe glanced upward with an expression of profound emotion; he was\nevidently fighting two battles, an outward and an inward one.\n\nPresently he added, \u201cI think the musketry is increasing on the left.\nDoes it strike you so?\u201d\n\nHe was all eagerness again, leaning forward with an air of earnest\nlistening, his face deeply flushed and his eye brilliant. Of a sudden\nthe combat above rose and swelled into higher violence. There was a\nclamor far away--it seemed nearly a mile away--over the hill. Then\nthe nearer musketry--first Thomas\u2019s on the shoulder of the ridge, next\nGildersleeve\u2019s in front--caught fire and raged with new fury.\n\nWaldron laughed outright. \u201cGahogan has reached them,\u201d he said to one of\nhis staff who had just rejoined him. \u201cWe shall all be up there in five\nminutes. Tell Colburn to bring on his regiment slowly.\u201d\n\nThen, turning to Fitz Hugh, he added, \u201cCaptain, we will ride forward.\u201d\n\nThey set off at a walk, now watching the smoking brow of the eminence,\nnow picking their way among dead and wounded. Suddenly there was a shout\nabove them and a sudden diminution of the firing; and looking upward\nthey saw the men of the Fourteenth running confusedly toward the summit.\nWithout a word the brigade commander struck spurs into his horse and\ndashed up the long slope at a run, closely followed by his enemy and\naid. What they saw when they overtook the straggling, running, panting,\nscreaming pellmell of the Fourteenth was victory!\n\nThe entire right wing of the Confederates, attacked on three sides at\nonce, placed at enormous disadvantage, completely outgeneraled, had\ngiven way in confusion, was retreating, breaking, and flying. There\nwere lines yet of dirty gray or butternut; but they were few, meagre,\nfluctuating, and recoiling, and there were scattered and scurrying men\nin hundreds. Three veteran and gallant regiments had gone all to wreck\nunder the shock of three similar regiments far more intelligently\ndirected. A strong position had been lost because the heroes who held it\ncould not perform the impossible feat of forming successively two fresh\nfronts under a concentric fire of musketry. The inferior brain power had\nconfessed the superiority of the stronger one.\n\nOn the victorious side there was wild, clamorous, fierce exultation. The\nhurrying, shouting, firing soldiers, who noted their commander riding\namong them, swung their rifles or their tattered hats at him, and\nscreamed \u201cHurrah!\u201d No one thought of the Confederate dead underfoot, nor\nof the Union dead who dotted the slope behind. \u201cWhat are you here\nfor, Colonel?\u201d shouted rough old Gildersleeve, one leg of his trousers\ndripping blood. \u201cWe can do it alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a battle won,\u201d laughed Fitz Hugh, almost worshiping the man whom\nhe had come to slay.\n\n\u201cIt is a battle won, but not used,\u201d answered Waldron. \u201cWe haven\u2019t a gun\nyet, nor a flag. Where is the cavalry? Why isn\u2019t Stilton here? He must\nhave got afoul of the enemy\u2019s horse, and been obliged to beat it off.\nCan anybody hear anything of Stilton?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet him go,\u201d roared Old Grumps. \u201cThe infantry don\u2019t want any help.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour regiment has suffered, Colonel,\u201d answered Waldron, glancing at the\nscattered files of the Fourteenth. \u201cHalt it and reorganize it, and\nlet it fall in with the right of the First when Peck comes up. I shall\nreplace you with the Fifth. Send your Adjutant back to Colburn and tell\nhim to hurry along. Those fellows are making a new front over there,\u201d\n he added, pointing to the centre of the hill. \u201cI want the Fifth, Seventh\nand Tenth in _\u00e9chelon_ as quickly as possible. And I want that cavalry.\nLieutenant,\u201d turning to one of his staff, \u201cride off to the left and find\nColonel Stilton. Tell him that I need a charge in ten minutes.\u201d\n\nPresently cannon opened from that part of the ridge still held by the\nConfederates, the shell tearing through or over the dissolving groups\nof their right wing, and cracking viciously above the heads of the\nvictorious Unionists. The explosions followed each other with stunning\nrapidity, and the shrill whirring of the splinters was ominous. Men\nbegan to fall again in the ranks or to drop out of them wounded. Of all\nthis Waldron took no further note than to ride hastily to the brow of\nthe ridge and look for his own artillery.\n\n\u201cSee how he attinds to iverything himself,\u201d said Major Gahogan, who\nhad cantered up to the side of Fitz Hugh. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matther of plain\nbusiness, an\u2019 he looks after it loike a business man. Did ye see us,\nthough, Captin, whin we come in on their right flank? By George, we\nmurthered urn. There\u2019s more\u2019n a hundred lyin\u2019 in hapes back there. As\nfor old Stilton, I just caught sight of um behind that wood to our left,\nan\u2019 he\u2019s makin\u2019 for the enemy\u2019s right rair. He\u2019ll have lots o\u2019 prisoners\nin half an hour.\u201d\n\nWhen Waldron returned to the group he was told of his cavalry\u2019s\nwhereabouts, and responded to the information with a smile of\nsatisfaction.\n\n\u201cBradley is hurrying up,\u201d he said, \u201cand Taylor is pushing their left\nsmartly. They will make one more tussle to recover their line of\nretreat; but we shall smash them from end to end and take every gun.\u201d\n\nHe galloped now to his infantry, and gave the word \u201cForward!\u201d The three\nregiments which composed the _\u00e9chelon_ were the Fifth on the right, the\nSeventh fifty yards to the rear and left of the Fifth, the Tenth to\nthe rear and left of the Seventh. It was behind the Fifth, that is, the\nforemost battalion, that the brigade commander posted himself.\n\n\u201cDo _you_ mean to stay here, Colonel?\u201d asked Fitz Hugh, in surprise and\nanxiety.\n\n\u201cIt is a certain victory now,\u201d answered Wal-dron, with a singular glance\nupward. \u201cMy life is no longer important. I prefer to do my duty to the\nutmost in the sight of all men.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall follow you and do mine, sir,\u201d said the Captain, much moved, he\ncould scarcely say by what emotions, they were so many and conflicting.\n\n\u201cI want you otherwheres. Ride to Colonel Taylor at once, and hurry him\nup the hill. Tell him the enemy have greatly weakened their left. Tell\nhim to push up everything, infantry, and cavalry, and artillery, and to\ndo it in haste.\u201d\n\n\u201cColonel, this is saving my life against my will,\u201d remonstrated Fitz\nHugh.\n\n\u201cGo!\u201d ordered Waldron, imperiously. \u201cTime is precious.\u201d\n\nFitz Hugh dashed down the slope to the right at a gallop. The brigade\ncommander turned tranquilly, and followed the march of his _\u00e9chelon_.\nThe second and decisive crisis of the little battle was approaching,\nand to understand it we must glance at the ground on which it was to\nbe fought. Two hostile lines were marching toward each other along\nthe broad, gently rounded crest of the hill and at right angles to its\ngeneral course. Between these lines, but much the nearest to the Union\ntroops, a spacious road came up out of the forest in front, crossed the\nridge, swept down the smooth decline in rear, and led to a single wooden\nbridge over a narrow but deep rivulet. On either hand the road was\nhedged in by a close board fence, four feet or so in height. It was for\nthe possession of this highway that the approaching lines were about\nto shed their blood. If the Confederates failed to win it all their\nartillery would be lost, and their army captured or dispersed.\n\nThe two parties came on without firing. The soldiers on both sides were\nveterans, cool, obedient to orders, intelligent through long service,\nand able to reserve all their resources for a short-range and final\nstruggle. Moreover, the fences as yet partially hid them from each\nother, and would have rendered all aim for the present vague and\nuncertain.\n\n\u201cForward, Fifth!\u201d shouted Waldron. \u201cSteady. Reserve your fire.\u201d Then, as\nthe regiment came up to the fence, he added, \u201cHalt; right dress. Steady,\nmen.\u201d\n\nMeantime he watched the advancing array with an eager gaze. It was a\nnoble sight, full of moral sublimity, and worthy of all admiration. The\nlong, lean, sunburned, weather-beaten soldiers, in ragged gray stepped\nforward, superbly, their ranks loose, but swift and firm, the men\nleaning forward in their haste, their tattered slouch hats pushed\nbackward, their whole aspect business-like and virile. Their line was\nthree battalions strong, far outflanking the Fifth, and at least equal\nto the entire _\u00e9chelon_. When within thirty or forty yards of the\nfurther fence they increased their pace to nearly a double-quick, many\nof them stooping low in hunter fashion, and a few firing. Then Waldron\nrose in his stirrups and yelled, \u201cBattalion! ready--aim--aim low. Fire!\u201d\n\nThere was a stunning roar of three hundred and fifty rifles, and a\ndeadly screech of bullets. But the smoke rolled out, the haste to reload\nwas intense, and none could mark what execution was done. Whatever the\nConfederates may have suffered, they bore up under the volley, and\nthey came on. In another minute each of those fences, not more than\ntwenty-five yards apart, was lined by the shattered fragment of a\nregiment, each firing as fast as possible into the face of the other.\n\nThe Fifth bled fearfully: it had five of its ten company commanders shot\ndead in three minutes; and its loss in other officers and in men fell\nscarcely short of this terrible ratio. On its left the Seventh and the\nTenth were up, pouring in musketry, and receiving it in a fashion hardly\nless sanguinary. No one present had ever seen, or ever afterward saw,\nsuch another close and deadly contest.\n\nBut the strangest thing in this whole wonderful fight was the conduct\nof the brigade commander. Up and down the rear of the lacerated Fifth\nWaldron rode thrice, spurring his plunging and wounded horse close to\nthe yelling and fighting file-closers, and shouting in a piercing voice\nencouragement to his men. Stranger still, considering the character\nwhich he had borne in the army, and considering the evil deed for which\nhe was to account on the morrow, were the words which he was distinctly\nand repeatedly heard to utter. \u201cStand steady, men--God is with us!\u201d was\nthe extraordinary battle-cry of this backslidden clergyman, this sinner\nabove many.\n\nAnd it was a prophecy of victory. Bradley ran up his Napoleons on the\nright in the nick of time, and, although only one of them could be\nbrought to bear, it was enough; the grape raked the Confederate left,\nbroke it, and the battle was over. In five minutes more their whole\narray was scattered, and the entire position open to galloping cavalry,\nseizing guns, standards, and prisoners.\n\nIt was in the very moment of triumph, just as the stubborn Southern line\nreeled back from the fence in isolated clusters, that the miraculous\nimmunity of Waldron terminated, and he received his death wound. A\nquarter of an hour later Fitz Hugh found a sorrowful group of officers\ngazing from a little distance upon their dying commander.\n\n\u201cIs the Colonel hit?\u201d he asked, shocked and grieved, incredible as the\nemotion may seem.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go near him,\u201d called Gildersleeve, who, it will be remembered,\nknew or guessed his errand in camp. \u201cThe chaplain and surgeon are there.\nLet him alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to render his account,\u201d added Ga-hogan. \u201cAn\u2019 whativer he\u2019s\ndone wrong, he\u2019s made it square to-day. Let um lave it to his brigade.\u201d\n\nAdjutant Wallis, who had been blubbering aloud, who had cursed the\nrebels and the luck energetically, and who had also been trying to pray\ninwardly, groaned out, \u201cThis is our last victory. You see if it ain\u2019t.\nBet you two to one.\u201d\n\n\u201cHush, man!\u201d replied Gahogan. \u201cWe\u2019ll win our share of um, though we\u2019ll\nhave to work harder for it. We\u2019ll have to do more ourselves, an\u2019 get\nless done for us in the way of tactics.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so, Major,\u201d whimpered a drummer, looking up from his duty of\nattending to a wounded comrade. \u201cHe knowed how to put his men in the\nright place, and his men knowed when they was in the right place. But\nit\u2019s goin\u2019 to be uphill through the steepest part of hell the rest of\nthe way.\u201d\n\nSoldiers, some of them weeping, some of them bleeding, arrived\nconstantly to inquire after their commander, only to be sent quietly\nback to their ranks or to the rear. Around lay other men--dead men,\nand senseless, groaning men--all for the present unnoticed. Everything,\nexcept the distant pursuit of the cavalry, waited for Wal-dron to die.\nFitz Hugh looked on silently with the tears of mingled emotions in his\neyes, and with hopes and hatreds expiring in his heart. The surgeon\nsupported the expiring victor\u2019s head, while Chaplain Colquhoun knelt\nbeside him, holding his hand and praying audibly. Of a sudden the\npetition ceased, both bent hastily toward the wounded man, and after\nwhat seemed a long time exchanged whispers. Then the Chaplain rose, came\nslowly toward the now advancing group of officers, his hands outspread\ntoward heaven in an attitude of benediction, and tears running down his\nhaggard white face.\n\n\u201cI trust, dear friends,\u201d he said, in a tremulous voice, \u201cthat all is\nwell with our brother and commander. His last words were, \u2018God is with\nus.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! but, man, _that_ isn\u2019t well,\u201d broke out Gahogan, in a groan. \u201cWhat\ndid ye pray for his soul for? Why didn\u2019t ye pray for his loife?\u201d\n\nFitz Hugh turned his horse and rode silently away. The next day he was\nseen journeying rearward by the side of an ambulance, within which lay\nwhat seemed a strangely delicate boy, insensible, and, one would say,\nmortally ill.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
