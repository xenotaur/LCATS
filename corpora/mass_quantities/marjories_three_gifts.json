Old Rover lay at her feet, the white kitten purred on her\nshoulder, and friendly robins hopped about her in the grass, chirping \u201cA\nhappy birthday, Marjorie!\u201d\n\nBut the little maid neither saw nor heard, for her eyes were fixed on\nthe green pods, and her thoughts were far away. She was recalling the\nfairy-tale granny told her last night, and wishing with all her heart\nthat such things happened nowadays. For in this story, as a poor girl\nlike herself sat spinning before the door, a Brownie came by, and gave\nthe child a good-luck penny; then a fairy passed, and left a talisman\nwhich would keep her always happy; and last of all, the prince rolled\nup in his chariot, and took her away to reign with him over a lovely\nkingdom, as a reward for her many kindnesses to others.\n\nWhen Marjorie imagined this part of the story, it was impossible to help\ngiving one little sigh, and for a minute she forgot her work, so busy\nwas she thinking what beautiful presents she would give to all the poor\nchildren in her realm when THEY had birthdays. Five impatient young peas\ntook this opportunity to escape from the half-open pod in her hand and\nskip down the steps, to be immediately gobbled up by an audacious robin,\nwho gave thanks in such a shrill chirp that Marjorie woke up, laughed,\nand fell to work again. She was just finishing, when a voice called out\nfrom the lane,--\n\n\u201cHi, there! come here a minute, child!\u201d and looking up, she saw a little\nold man in a queer little carriage drawn by a fat little pony.\n\nRunning down to the gate, Marjorie dropped a curtsy, saying\npleasantly,--\n\n\u201cWhat did you wish, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust undo that check-rein for me. I am lame, and Jack wants to drink\nat your brook,\u201d answered the old man, nodding at her till his spectacles\ndanced on his nose.\n\nMarjorie was rather afraid of the fat pony, who tossed his head, whisked\nhis tail, and stamped his feet as if he was of a peppery temper. But she\nliked to be useful, and just then felt as if there were few things she\ncould NOT do if she tried, because it was her birthday. So she proudly\nlet down the rein, and when Jack went splashing into the brook, she\nstood on the bridge, waiting to check him up again after he had drunk\nhis fill of the clear, cool water.\n\nThe old gentleman sat in his place, looking up at the little girl, who\nwas smiling to herself as she watched the blue dragon-flies dance among\nthe ferns, a blackbird tilt on the alderboughs, and listened to the\nbabble of the brook.\n\n\u201cHow old are you, child?\u201d asked the old man, as if he rather envied this\nrosy creature her youth and health.\n\n\u201cTwelve to-day, sir;\u201d and Marjorie stood up straight and tall, as if\nmindful of her years.\n\n\u201cHad any presents?\u201d asked the old man, peering up with an odd smile.\n\n\u201cOne, sir,--here it is;\u201d and she pulled out of her pocket a tin\nsavings-bank in the shape of a desirable family mansion, painted red,\nwith a green door and black chimney. Proudly displaying it on the rude\nrailing of the bridge, she added, with a happy face,--\n\n\u201cGranny gave it to me, and all the money in it is going to be mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much have you got?\u201d asked the old gentleman, who appeared to like\nto sit there in the middle of the brook, while Jack bathed his feet and\nleisurely gurgled and sneezed.\n\n\u201cNot a penny yet, but I'm going to earn some,\u201d answered Marjorie,\npatting the little bank with an air of resolution pretty to see.\n\n\u201cHow will you do it?\u201d continued the inquisitive old man.\n\n\u201cOh, I'm going to pick berries and dig dandelions, and weed, and drive\ncows, and do chores. It is vacation, and I can work all the time, and\nearn ever so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut vacation is play-time,--how about that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, that sort of work IS play, and I get bits of fun all along. I\nalways have a good swing when I go for the cows, and pick flowers with\nthe dandelions. Weeding isn't so nice, but berrying is very pleasant,\nand we have good times all together.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat shall you do with your money when you get it?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, lots of things! Buy books and clothes for school, and, if I get a\ngreat deal, give some to granny. I'd love to do that, for she takes care\nof me, and I'd be so proud to help her!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood little lass!\u201d said the old gentleman, as he put his hand in his\npocket. \u201cWould you now?\u201d he added, apparently addressing himself to a\nlarge frog who sat upon a stone, looking so wise and grandfatherly that\nit really did seem quite proper to consult him. At all events, he gave\nhis opinion in the most decided manner, for, with a loud croak, he\nturned an undignified somersault into the brook, splashing up the\nwater at a great rate. \u201cWell, perhaps it wouldn't be best on the whole.\nIndustry is a good teacher, and money cannot buy happiness, as I know to\nmy sorrow.\u201d\n\nThe old gentleman still seemed to be talking to the frog, and as he\nspoke he took his hand out of his pocket with less in it than he had at\nfirst intended.\n\n\u201cWhat a very queer person!\u201d thought Marjorie, for she had not heard a\nword, and wondered what he was thinking about down there.\n\nJack walked out of the brook just then, and she ran to check him up; not\nan easy task for little hands, as he preferred to nibble the grass\non the bank. But she did it cleverly, smoothed the ruffled mane, and,\ndropping another curtsy, stood aside to let the little carriage pass.\n\n\u201cThank you, child--thank you. Here is something for your bank, and good\nluck to it.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke, the old man laid a bright gold dollar in her hand, patted\nthe rosy cheek, and vanished in a cloud of dust, leaving Marjorie so\nastonished at the grandeur of the gift, that she stood looking at it\nas if it had been a fortune. It was to her; and visions of pink calico\ngowns, new grammars, and fresh hat-ribbons danced through her head in\ndelightful confusion, as her eyes rested on the shining coin in her\npalm.\n\nThen, with a solemn air, she invested her first money by popping it down\nthe chimney of the scarlet mansion, and peeping in with one eye to see\nif it landed safely on the ground-floor. This done, she took a long\nbreath, and looked over the railing, to be sure it was not all a dream.\nNo; the wheel marks were still there, the brown water was not yet clear,\nand, if a witness was needed, there sat the big frog again, looking so\nlike the old gentleman, with his bottle-green coat, speckled trousers,\nand twinkling eyes, that Marjorie burst out laughing, and clapped her\nhands, saying aloud,--\n\n\u201cI'll play he was the Brownie, and this is the good-luck penny he gave\nme. Oh, what fun!\u201d and away she skipped, rattling the dear new bank like\na castanet.\n\nWhen she had told granny all about it, she got knife and basket, and\nwent out to dig dandelions; for the desire to increase her fortune was\nso strong, she could not rest a minute. Up and down she went, so busily\npeering and digging, that she never lifted up her eyes till something\nlike a great white bird skimmed by so low she could not help seeing\nit. A pleasant laugh sounded behind her as she started up, and, looking\nround, she nearly sat down again in sheer surprise, for there close by\nwas a slender little lady, comfortably established under a big umbrella.\n\n\u201cIf there WERE any fairies, I'd be sure that was one,\u201d thought Marjorie,\nstaring with all her might, for her mind was still full of the old\nstory; and curious things do happen on birthdays, as every one knows.\n\nIt really did seem rather elfish to look up suddenly and see a lovely\nlady all in white, with shining hair and a wand in her hand, sitting\nunder what looked very like a large yellow mushroom in the middle of\na meadow, where, till now, nothing but cows and grasshoppers had been\nseen. Before Marjorie could decide the question, the pleasant laugh came\nagain, and the stranger said, pointing to the white thing that was still\nfluttering over the grass like a little cloud,--\n\n\u201cWould you kindly catch my hat for me, before it blows quite away?\u201d\n\nDown went basket and knife, and away ran Marjorie, entirely satisfied\nnow that there was no magic about the new-comer; for if she had been an\nelf, couldn't she have got her hat without any help from a mortal child?\nPresently, however, it did begin to seem as if that hat was bewitched,\nfor it led the nimble-footed Marjorie such a chase that the cows stopped\nfeeding to look on in placid wonder; the grasshoppers vainly tried to\nkeep up, and every ox-eye daisy did its best to catch the runaway, but\nfailed entirely, for the wind liked a game of romps, and had it that\nday. As she ran, Marjorie heard the lady singing, like the princess in\nthe story of the Goose-Girl,--\n\n    \u201cBlow, breezes, blow!\n     Let Curdkin's hat go!\n     Blow, breezes, blow!\n     Let him after it go!\n     O'er hills, dales and rocks,\n          Away be it whirled,\n     Till the silvery locks\n          Are all combed and curled.\u201d\n\nThis made her laugh so that she tumbled into a clover-bed, and lay there\na minute to get her breath. Just then, as if the playful wind\nrepented of its frolic, the long veil fastened to the hat caught in a\nblackberry-vine near by, and held the truant fast till Marjorie secured\nit.\n\n\u201cNow come and see what I am doing,\u201d said the lady, when she had thanked\nthe child.\n\nMarjorie drew near confidingly, and looked down at the wide-spread book\nbefore her. She gave a start, and laughed out with surprise and delight;\nfor there was a lovely picture of her own little home, and her own\nlittle self on the door-step, all so delicate, and beautiful, and true,\nit seemed as if done by magic.\n\n\u201cOh, how pretty! There is Rover, and Kitty and the robins, and me! How\ncould you ever do it, ma'am?\u201d said Marjorie, with a wondering glance\nat the long paint-brush, which had wrought what seemed a miracle to her\nchildish eyes.\n\n\u201cI'll show you presently; but tell me, first, if it looks quite right\nand natural to you. Children sometimes spy out faults that no one else\ncan see,\u201d answered the lady, evidently pleased with the artless praise\nher work received.\n\n\u201cIt looks just like our house, only more beautiful. Perhaps that is\nbecause I know how shabby it really is. That moss looks lovely on the\nshingles, but the roof leaks. The porch is broken, only the roses hide\nthe place; and my gown is all faded, though it once was as bright as you\nhave made it. I wish the house and everything would stay pretty forever,\nas they will in the picture.\u201d\n\nWhile Marjorie spoke, the lady had been adding more color to the sketch,\nand when she looked up, something warmer and brighter than sunshine\nshone in her face, as she said, so cheerily, it was like a bird's song\nto hear her,--\n\n\u201cIt can't be summer always, dear, but we can make fair weather for\nourselves if we try. The moss, the roses, and soft shadows show the\nlittle house and the little girl at their best, and that is what we all\nshould do; for it is amazing how lovely common things become, if one\nonly knows how to look at them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish _I_ did,\u201d said Marjorie, half to herself, remembering how often\nshe was discontented, and how hard it was to get on, sometimes.\n\n\u201cSo do I,\u201d said the lady, in her happy voice. \u201cJust believe that there\nis a sunny side to everything, and try to find it, and you will be\nsurprised to see how bright the world will seem, and how cheerful you\nwill be able to keep your little self.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess granny has found that out, for she never frets. I do, but I'm\ngoing to stop it, because I'm twelve to-day, and that is too old for\nsuch things,\u201d said Marjorie, recollecting the good resolutions she had\nmade that morning when she woke.\n\n\u201cI am twice twelve, and not entirely cured yet; but I try, and don't\nmean to wear blue spectacles if I can help it,\u201d answered the lady,\nlaughing so blithely that Marjorie was sure she would not have to try\nmuch longer. \u201cBirthdays were made for presents, and I should like to\ngive you one. Would it please you to have this little picture?\u201d she\nadded, lifting it out of the book.\n\n\u201cTruly my own? Oh, yes, indeed!\u201d cried Marjorie, coloring with pleasure,\nfor she had never owned so beautiful a thing before.\n\n\u201cThen you shall have it, dear. Hang it where you can see it often, and\nwhen you look, remember that it is the sunny side of home, and help to\nkeep it so.\u201d\n\nMarjorie had nothing but a kiss to offer by way of thanks, as the lovely\nsketch was put into her hand; but the giver seemed quite satisfied, for\nit was a very grateful little kiss. Then the child took up her basket\nand went away, not dancing and singing now, but slowly and silently; for\nthis gift made her thoughtful as well as glad. As she climbed the wall,\nshe looked back to nod good-by to the pretty lady; but the meadow was\nempty, and all she saw was the grass blowing in the wind.\n\n\u201cNow, deary, run out and play, for birthdays come but once a year,\nand we must make them as merry as we can,\u201d said granny, as she settled\nherself for her afternoon nap, when the Saturday cleaning was all done,\nand the little house as neat as wax.\n\nSo Marjorie put on a white apron in honor of the occasion, and, taking\nKitty in her arms, went out to enjoy herself. Three swings on the gate\nseemed to be a good way of beginning the festivities; but she only got\ntwo, for when the gate creaked back the second time, it stayed shut, and\nMarjorie hung over the pickets, arrested by the sound of music.\n\n\u201cIt's soldiers,\u201d she said, as the fife and drum drew nearer, and flags\nwere seen waving over the barberry-bushes at the corner.\n\n\u201cNo; it's a picnic,\u201d she added in a moment; for she saw hats with\nwreaths about them bobbing up and down, as a gayly-trimmed hay-cart full\nof children came rumbling down the lane.\n\n\u201cWhat a nice time they are going to have!\u201d thought Marjorie, sadly\ncontrasting that merry-making with the quiet party she was having all by\nherself.\n\nSuddenly her face shone, and Kitty was waved over her head like a\nbanner, as she flew out of the gate, crying, rapturously,--\n\n\u201cIt's Billy! and I know he's come for me!\u201d\n\nIt certainly WAS Billy, proudly driving the old horse, and beaming at\nhis little friend from the bower of flags and chestnut-boughs, where he\nsat in state, with a crown of daisies on his sailor-hat and a spray of\nblooming sweetbrier in his hand. Waving his rustic sceptre, he led off\nthe shout of \u201cHappy birthday, Marjorie!\u201d which was set up as the wagon\nstopped at the gate, and the green boughs suddenly blossomed with\nfamiliar faces, all smiling on the little damsel, who stood in the lane\nquite overpowered with delight.\n\n\u201cIt's a s'prise party!\u201d cried one small lad, tumbling out behind.\n\n\u201cWe are going up the mountain to have fun!\u201d added a chorus of voices, as\na dozen hands beckoned wildly.\n\n\u201cWe got it up on purpose for you, so tie your hat and come away,\u201d said\na pretty girl, leaning down to kiss Marjorie, who had dropped Kitty, and\nstood ready for any splendid enterprise.\n\nA word to granny, and away went the happy child, sitting up beside\nBilly, under the flags that waved over a happier load than any royal\nchariot ever bore.\n\nIt would be vain to try and tell all the plays and pleasures of happy\nchildren on a Saturday afternoon, but we may briefly say that Marjorie\nfound a mossy stone all ready for her throne, and Billy crowned her with\na garland like his own. That a fine banquet was spread, and eaten with\na relish many a Lord Mayor's feast has lacked. Then how the whole court\ndanced and played together afterward! The lords climbed trees and turned\nsomersaults, the ladies gathered flowers and told secrets under the\nsweetfern-bushes, the queen lost her shoe jumping over the waterfall,\nand the king paddled into the pool below and rescued it. A happy little\nkingdom, full of summer sunshine, innocent delights, and loyal hearts;\nfor love ruled, and the only war that disturbed the peaceful land was\nwaged by the mosquitoes as night came on.\n\nMarjorie stood on her throne watching the sunset while her maids of\nhonor packed up the remains of the banquet, and her knights prepared\nthe chariot. All the sky was gold and purple, all the world bathed in a\nsoft, red light, and the little girl was very happy as she looked down\nat the subjects who had served her so faithfully that day.\n\n\u201cHave you had a good time, Marjy?\u201d asked King William; who stood below,\nwith his royal nose on a level with her majesty's two dusty little\nshoes.\n\n\u201cOh, Billy, it has been just splendid! But I don't see why you should\nall be so kind to me,\u201d answered Marjorie, with such a look of innocent\nwonder, that Billy laughed to see it.\n\n\u201cBecause you are so sweet and good, we can't help loving you,--that's\nwhy,\u201d he said, as if this simple fact was reason enough.\n\n\u201cI'm going to be the best girl that ever was, and love everybody in the\nworld,\u201d cried the child, stretching out her arms as if ready, in the\nfulness of her happy heart, to embrace all creation.\n\n\u201cDon't turn into an angel and fly away just yet, but come home, or\ngranny will never lend you to us any more.\u201d\n\nWith that, Billy jumped her down, and away they ran, to ride gayly back\nthrough the twilight, singing like a flock of nightingales.\n\nAs she went to bed that night, Marjorie looked at the red bank, the\npretty picture, and the daisy crown, saying to herself,--\n\n\u201cIt has been a VERY nice birthday, and I am something like the girl in\nthe story, after all, for the old man gave me a good-luck penny, the\nkind lady told me how to keep happy, and Billy came for me like the\nprince. The girl didn't go back to the poor house again, but I'm glad\n_I_ did, for MY granny isn't a cross one, and my little home is the\ndearest in the world.\u201d\n\nThen she tied her night-cap, said her prayers, and fell asleep; but the\nmoon, looking in to kiss the blooming face upon the pillow, knew that\nthree good spirits had come to help little Marjorie from that day forth,\nand their names were Industry, Cheerfulness, and Love.\n\n\n\n\n\nROSES AND FORGET-ME-NOTS\n\n\n\n\nI. ROSES\n\n\nIt was a cold November storm, and everything looked forlorn. Even the\npert sparrows were draggle-tailed and too much out of spirits to fight\nfor crumbs with the fat pigeons who tripped through the mud with their\nlittle red boots as if in haste to get back to their cosy home in the\ndove-cot.\n\nBut the most forlorn creature out that day was a small errand girl, with\na bonnet-box on each arm, and both hands struggling to hold a big broken\numbrella. A pair of worn-out boots let in the wet upon her tired feet; a\nthin cotton dress and an old shawl poorly protected her from the storm;\nand a faded hood covered her head.\n\nThe face that looked out from this hood was too pale and anxious for one\nso young; and when a sudden gust turned the old umbrella inside out with\na crash, despair fell upon poor Lizzie, and she was so miserable she\ncould have sat down in the rain and cried.\n\nBut there was no time for tears; so, dragging the dilapidated umbrella\nalong, she spread her shawl over the bonnet-boxes and hurried down the\nbroad street, eager to hide her misfortunes from a pretty young girl who\nstood at a window laughing at her.\n\nShe could not find the number of the house where one of the fine hats\nwas to be left; and after hunting all down one side of the street, she\ncrossed over, and came at last to the very house where the pretty girl\nlived. She was no longer to be seen; and, with a sigh of relief, Lizzie\nrang the bell, and was told to wait in the hall while Miss Belle tried\nthe hat on.\n\nGlad to rest, she warmed her feet, righted her umbrella, and then sat\nlooking about her with eyes quick to see the beauty and the comfort that\nmade the place so homelike and delightful. A small waiting-room opened\nfrom the hall, and in it stood many blooming plants, whose fragrance\nattracted Lizzie as irresistibly as if she had been a butterfly or bee.\n\nSlipping in, she stood enjoying the lovely colors, sweet odors, and\ndelicate shapes of these household spirits; for Lizzie loved flowers\npassionately; and just then they possessed a peculiar charm for her.\n\nOne particularly captivating little rose won her heart, and made her\nlong for it with a longing that became a temptation too strong to\nresist. It was so perfect; so like a rosy face smiling out from the\ngreen leaves, that Lizzie could NOT keep her hands off it, and having\nsmelt, touched, and kissed it, she suddenly broke the stem and hid it in\nher pocket. Then, frightened at what she had done, she crept back to her\nplace in the hall, and sat there, burdened with remorse.\n\nA servant came just then to lead her upstairs; for Miss Belle wished the\nhat altered, and must give directions. With her heart in a flutter, and\npinker roses in her cheeks than the one in her pocket, Lizzie followed\nto a handsome room, where a pretty girl stood before a long mirror with\nthe hat in her hand.\n\n\u201cTell Madame Tifany that I don't like it at all, for she hasn't put in\nthe blue plume mamma ordered; and I won't have rose-buds, they are so\ncommon,\u201d said the young lady, in a dissatisfied tone, as she twirled the\nhat about.\n\n\u201cYes, miss,\u201d was all Lizzie could say; for SHE considered that hat the\nloveliest thing a girl could possibly own.\n\n\u201cYou had better ask your mamma about it, Miss Belle, before you give any\norders. She will be up in a few moments, and the girl can wait,\u201d put in\na maid, who was sewing in the ante-room.\n\n\u201cI suppose I must; but I WON'T have roses,\u201d answered Belle, crossly.\nThen she glanced at Lizzie, and said more gently, \u201cYou look very cold;\ncome and sit by the fire while you wait.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm afraid I'll wet the pretty rug, miss; my feet are sopping,\u201d said\nLizzie, gratefully, but timidly.\n\n\u201cSo they are! Why didn't you wear rubber boots?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven't got any.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'll give you mine, then, for I hate them; and as I never go out in\nwet weather, they are of no earthly use to me. Marie, bring them here;\nI shall be glad to get rid of them, and I'm sure they'll be useful to\nyou.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, thank you, miss! I'd like 'em ever so much, for I'm out in the rain\nhalf the time, and get bad colds because my boots are old,\u201d said Lizzie,\nsmiling brightly at the thought of the welcome gift.\n\n\u201cI should think your mother would get you warmer things,\u201d began Belle,\nwho found something rather interesting in the shabby girl, with shy\nbright eyes, and curly hair bursting out of the old hood.\n\n\u201cI haven't got any mother,\u201d said Lizzie, with a pathetic glance at her\npoor clothes.\n\n\u201cI'm so sorry! Have you brothers and sisters?\u201d asked Belle, hoping to\nfind something pleasant to talk about; for she was a kind little soul.\n\n\u201cNo, miss; I've got no folks at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, dear; how sad! Why, who takes care of you?\u201d cried Belle, looking\nquite distressed.\n\n\u201cNo one; I take care of myself. I work for Madame, and she pays me a\ndollar a week. I stay with Mrs. Brown, and chore round to pay for my\nkeep. My dollar don't get many clothes, so I can't be as neat as I'd\nlike.\u201d And the forlorn look came back to poor Lizzie's face.\n\nBelle said nothing, but sat among the sofa cushions, where she had\nthrown herself, looking soberly at this other girl, no older than she\nwas, who took care of herself and was all alone in the world. It was a\nnew idea to Belle, who was loved and petted as an only child is apt to\nbe. She often saw beggars and pitied them, but knew very little about\ntheir wants and lives; so it was like turning a new page in her happy\nlife to be brought so near to poverty as this chance meeting with the\nmilliner's girl.\n\n\u201cAren't you afraid and lonely and unhappy?\u201d she said, slowly, trying to\nunderstand and put herself in Lizzie's place.\n\n\u201cYes; but it's no use. I can't help it, and may be things will get\nbetter by and by, and I'll have my wish,\u201d answered Lizzie, more\nhopefully, because Belle's pity warmed her heart and made her troubles\nseem lighter.\n\n\u201cWhat is your wish?\u201d asked Belle, hoping mamma wouldn't come just yet,\nfor she was getting interested in the stranger.\n\n\u201cTo have a nice little room, and make flowers, like a French girl I\nknow. It's such pretty work, and she gets lots of money, for every one\nlikes her flowers. She shows me how, sometimes, and I can do leaves\nfirst-rate; but--\u201d\n\nThere Lizzie stopped suddenly, and the color rushed up to her forehead;\nfor she remembered the little rose in her pocket and it weighed upon her\nconscience like a stone.\n\nBefore Belle could ask what was the matter, Marie came in with a tray of\ncake and fruit, saying:\n\n\u201cHere's your lunch, Miss Belle.\u201d\n\n\u201cPut it down, please; I'm not ready for it yet.\u201d\n\nAnd Belle shook her head as she glanced at Lizzie, who was staring hard\nat the fire with such a troubled face that Belle could not bear to see\nit.\n\nJumping out of her nest of cushions, she heaped a plate with good\nthings, and going to Lizzie, offered it, saying, with a gentle courtesy\nthat made the act doubly sweet:\n\n\u201cPlease have some; you must be tired of waiting.\u201d\n\nBut Lizzie could not take it; she could only cover her face and cry;\nfor this kindness rent her heart and made the stolen flower a burden too\nheavy to be borne.\n\n\u201cOh, don't cry so! Are you sick? Have I been rude? Tell me all about\nit; and if I can't do anything, mamma can,\u201d said Belle, surprised and\ntroubled.\n\n\u201cNo; I'm not sick; I'm bad, and I can't bear it when you are so good to\nme,\u201d sobbed Lizzie, quite overcome with penitence; and taking out the\ncrumpled rose, she confessed her fault with many tears.\n\n\u201cDon't feel so much about such a little thing as that,\u201d began Belle,\nwarmly; then checked herself, and added, more soberly, \u201cIt WAS wrong to\ntake it without leave; but it's all right now, and I'll give you as many\nroses as you want, for I know you are a good girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you. I didn't want it only because it was pretty, but I wanted to\ncopy it. I can't get any for myself, and so I can't do my make-believe\nones well. Madame won't even lend me the old ones in the store, and\nEstelle has none to spare for me, because I can't pay her for teaching\nme. She gives me bits of muslin and wire and things, and shows me now\nand then. But I know if I had a real flower I could copy it; so she'd\nsee I did know something, for I try real hard. I'm SO tired of slopping\nround the streets, I'd do anything to earn my living some other way.\u201d\n\nLizzie had poured out her trouble rapidly; and the little story was\nquite affecting when one saw the tears on her cheeks, the poor clothes,\nand the thin hands that held the stolen rose. Belle was much touched,\nand, in her impetuous way, set about mending matters as fast as\npossible.\n\n\u201cPut on those boots and that pair of dry stockings right away. Then tuck\nas much cake and fruit into your pocket as it will hold. I'm going to\nget you some flowers, and see if mamma is too busy to attend to me.\u201d\n\nWith a nod and a smile, Belle flew about the room a minute; then\nvanished, leaving Lizzie to her comfortable task, feeling as if fairies\nstill haunted the world as in the good old times.\n\nWhen Belle came back with a handful of roses, she found Lizzie absorbed\nin admiring contemplation of her new boots, as she ate sponge-cake in a\nblissful sort of waking-dream.\n\n\u201cMamma can't come; but I don't care about the hat. It will do very well,\nand isn't worth fussing about. There, will those be of any use to you?\u201d\n And she offered the nosegay with a much happier face than the one Lizzie\nfirst saw.\n\n\u201cOh, miss, they're just lovely! I'll copy that pink rose as soon as ever\nI can, and when I've learned how to do 'em tip-top, I'd like to bring\nyou some, if you don't mind,\u201d answered Lizzie, smiling all over her face\nas she buried her nose luxuriously in the fragrant mass.\n\n\u201cI'd like it very much, for I should think you'd have to be very clever\nto make such pretty things. I really quite fancy those rosebuds in my\nhat, now I know that you're going to learn how to make them. Put an\norange in your pocket, and the flowers in water as soon as you can, so\nthey'll be fresh when you want them. Good-by. Bring home our hats every\ntime and tell me how you get on.\u201d\n\nWith kind words like these, Belle dismissed Lizzie, who ran downstairs,\nfeeling as rich as if she had found a fortune. Away to the next place\nshe hurried, anxious to get her errands done and the precious posy\nsafely into fresh water. But Mrs. Turretviile was not at home, and the\nbonnet could not be left till paid for. So Lizzie turned to go down the\nhigh steps, glad that she need not wait. She stopped one instant to take\na delicious sniff at her flowers, and that was the last happy moment\nthat poor Lizzie knew for many weary months.\n\nThe new boots were large for her, the steps slippery with sleet, and\ndown went the little errand girl, from top to bottom, till she landed in\nthe gutter directly upon Mrs. Turretville's costly bonnet.\n\n\u201cI've saved my posies, anyway,\u201d sighed Lizzie, as she picked herself\nup, bruised, wet, and faint with pain; \u201cbut, oh, my heart! won't Madame\nscold when she sees that band-box smashed flat,\u201d groaned the poor child,\nsitting on the curbstone to get her breath and view the disaster.\n\nThe rain poured, the wind blew, the sparrows on the park railing chirped\nderisively, and no one came along to help Lizzie out of her troubles.\nSlowly she gathered up her burdens; painfully she limped away in the big\nboots; and the last the naughty sparrows saw of her was a shabby little\nfigure going round the corner, with a pale, tearful face held lovingly\nover the bright bouquet that was her one treasure and her only comfort\nin the moment which brought to her the great misfortune of her life.\n\n\n\n\nII. FORGET-ME-NOTS\n\n\n\u201cOh, mamma, I am so relieved that the box has come at last! If it had\nnot, I do believe I should have died of disappointment,\u201d cried pretty\nBelle, five years later, on the morning before her eighteenth birthday.\n\n\u201cIt would have been a serious disappointment, darling; for I had sot\nmy heart on your wearing my gift to-morrow night, and when the steamers\nkept coming in without my trunk from Paris, I was very anxious. I hope\nyou will like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDear mamma, I know I shall like it; your taste is so good and you know\nwhat suits me so well. Make haste, Marie; I'm dying to see it,\u201d said\nBelle, dancing about the great trunk, as the maid carefully unfolded\ntissue papers and muslin wrappers.\n\nA young girl's first ball-dress is a grand affair,--in her eyes, at\nleast; and Belle soon stopped dancing, to stand with clasped hands,\neager eyes and parted lips before the snowy pile of illusion that was\nat last daintily lifted out upon the bed. Then, as Marie displayed\nits loveliness, little cries of delight were heard, and when the whole\ndelicate dress was arranged to the best effect she threw herself upon\nher mother's neck and actually cried with pleasure.\n\n\u201cMamma, it is too lovely I and you are very kind to do so much for me.\nHow shall I ever thank you?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy putting it right on to see if it fits; and when you wear it look\nyour happiest, that I may be proud of my pretty daughter.\u201d\n\nMamma got no further, for Marie uttered a French shriek, wrung her\nhands, and then began to burrow wildly in the trunk and among the\npapers, crying distractedly:\n\n\u201cGreat Heavens, madame! the wreath has been forgotten! What an\naffliction! Mademoiselle's enchanting toilette is destroyed without the\nwreath, and nowhere do I find it.\u201d\n\nIn vain they searched; in vain Marie wailed and Belle declared it must\nbe somewhere; no wreath appeared. It was duly set down in the bill, and\na fine sum charged for a head-dress to match the dainty forget-me-nots\nthat looped the fleecy skirts and ornamented the bosom of the dress. It\nhad evidently been forgotten; and mamma despatched Marie at once to try\nand match the flowers, for Belle would not hear of any other decoration\nfor her beautiful blonde hair.\n\nThe dress fitted to a charm, and was pronounced by all beholders the\nloveliest thing ever seen. Nothing was wanted but the wreath to make\nit quite perfect, and when Marie returned, after a long search, with no\nforget-me-nots, Belle was in despair.\n\n\u201cWear natural ones,\u201d suggested a sympathizing friend.\n\nBut another hunt among greenhouses was as fruitless as that among the\nmilliners' rooms. No forget-me-nots could be found, and Marie fell\nexhausted into a chair, desolated at what she felt to be an awful\ncalamity.\n\n\u201cLet me have the carriage, and I'll ransack the city till I find some,\u201d\n cried Belle, growing more resolute with each failure.\n\nMarnma was deep in preparations for the ball, and could not help her\nafflicted daughter, though she was much disappointed at the mishap. So\nBelle drove off, resolved to have her flowers whether there were any or\nnot.\n\nAny one who has ever tried to match a ribbon, find a certain fabric, or\nget anything done in a hurry, knows what a wearisome task it\nsometimes is, and can imagine Belle's state of mind after repeated\ndisappointments. She was about to give up in despair, when some one\nsuggested that perhaps the Frenchwoman, Estelle Valnor, might make the\ndesired wreath, if there was time.\n\nAway drove Belle, and, on entering the room, gave a sigh of\nsatisfaction, for a whole boxful of the loveliest forget-me-nots stood\nupon the table. As fast as possible, she told her tale and demanded the\nflowers, no matter what the price might be. Imagine her feelings when\nthe Frenchwoman, with a shrug, announced that it was impossible to give\nmademoiselle a single spray. All were engaged to trim a bridesmaid's\ndress, and must be sent away at once.\n\nIt really was too bad! and Belle lost her temper entirely, for no\npersuasion or bribes would win a spray from Estelle. The provoking part\nof it was that the wedding would not come off for several days, and\nthere was time enough to make more flowers for that dress, since Belle\nonly wanted a few for her hair. Neither would Estelle make her any, as\nher hands were full, and so small an order was not worth deranging one's\nself for; but observing Belle's sorrowful face, she said, affably:\n\n\u201cMademoiselle may, perhaps, find the flowers she desires at Miss\nBerton's. She has been helping me with these garlands, and may have some\nleft. Here is her address.\u201d\n\nBelle took the card with thanks, and hurried away with a last hope\nfaintly stirring in her girlish heart, for Belle had an unusually ardent\nwish to look her best at this party, since Somebody was to be there, and\nSomebody considered forget-me-nots the sweetest flowers in the world.\nMamma knew this, and the kiss Belle gave her when the dress came had a\nmore tender meaning than gratified vanity or daughterly love.\n\nUp many stairs she climbed, and came at last to a little room, very poor\nbut very neat, where, at the one window, sat a young girl, with crutches\nby her side and her lap full of flower-leaves and petals. She rose\nslowly as Belle came in, and then stood looking at her, with such a\nwistful expression in her shy, bright eyes, that Belle's anxious face\ncleared involuntarily, and her voice lost its impatient tone.\n\nAs she spoke, she glanced about the room, hoping to see some blue\nblossoms awaiting her. But none appeared; and she was about to despond\nagain, when the girl said, gently:\n\n\u201cI have none by me now, but I may be able to find you some.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you very much; but I have been everywhere in vain. Still, if\nyou do get any, please send them to me as soon as possible. Here is my\ncard.\u201d\n\nMiss Berton glanced at it, then cast a quick look at the sweet, anxious\nface before her, and smiled so brightly that Belle smiled also, and\nasked, wonderingly:\n\n\u201cWhat is it? What do you see?\u201d\n\n\u201cI see the dear young lady who was so kind to me long ago. You don't\nremember me, and never knew my name; but I never have forgotten you all\nthese years. I always hoped I could do something to show how grateful\nI was, and now I can, for you shall have your flowers if I sit up all\nnight to make them.\u201d\n\nBut Belle still shook her head and watched the smiling face before\nher with wondering eyes, till the girl added, with sudden color in her\ncheeks:\n\n\u201cAh, you've done so many kind things in your life, you don't remember\nthe little errand girl from Madame Tifany's who stole a rose in your\nhall, and how you gave her rubber boots and cake and flowers, and were\nso good to her she couldn't forget it if she lived to be a hundred.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you are so changed,\u201d began Belle, who did faintly recollect that\nlittle incident in her happy life.\n\n\u201cYes, I had a fall and hurt myself so that I shall always be lame.\u201d\n\nAnd Lizzie went on to tell how Madame had dismissed her in a rage; how\nshe lay ill till Mrs. Brown sent her to the hospital; and how for a year\nshe had suffered much alone, in that great house of pain, before one of\nthe kind visitors had befriended her.\n\nWhile hearing the story of the five years, that had been so full of\npleasure, ease and love for herself, Belle forgot her errand, and,\nsitting beside Lizzie, listened with pitying eyes to all she told of her\nendeavors to support herself by the delicate handiwork she loved.\n\n\u201cI'm very happy now,\u201d ended Lizzie, looking about the little bare room\nwith a face full of the sweetest content. \u201cI get nearly work enough to\npay my way, and Estelle sends me some when she has more than she can do.\nI've learned to do it nicely, and it is so pleasant to sit here and make\nflowers instead of trudging about in the wet with other people's hats.\nThough I do sometimes wish I was able to trudge, one gets on so slowly\nwith crutches.\u201d\n\nA little sigh followed the words, and Belle put her own plump hand on\nthe delicate one that held the crutch, saying, in her cordial young\nvoice:\n\n\u201cI'll come and take you to drive sometimes, for you are too pale, and\nyou'll get ill sitting here at work day after day. Please let me; I'd\nlove to; for I feel so idle and wicked when I see busy people like you\nthat I reproach myself for neglecting my duty and having more than my\nshare of happiness.\u201d\n\nLizzie thanked her with a look, and then said, in a tone of interest\nthat was delightful to hear:\n\n\u201cTell about the wreath you want; I should so love to do it for you, if I\ncan.\u201d\n\nBelle had forgotten all about it in listening to this sad little story\nof a girl's life. Now she felt half ashamed to talk of so frivolous a\nmatter till she remembered that it would help Lizzie; and, resolving to\npay for it as never garland was paid for before, she entered upon the\nsubject with renewed interest.\n\n\u201cYou shall have the flowers in time for your ball to-morrow night. I\nwill engage to make a wreath that will please you, only it may take\nlonger than I think. Don't be troubled if I don't send it till evening;\nit will surely come in time. I can work fast, and this will be the\nhappiest job I ever did,\u201d said Lizzie, beginning to lay out mysterious\nlittle tools and bend delicate wires.\n\n\u201cYou are altogether too grateful for the little I have done. It makes\nme feel ashamed to think I did not find you out before and do something\nbetter worth thanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, it wasn't the boots or the cake or the roses, dear Miss Belle. It\nwas the kind looks, the gentle words, the way it was done, that went\nright to my heart, and did me more good than a million of money. I never\nstole a pin after that day, for the little rose wouldn't let me forget\nhow you forgave me so sweetly. I sometimes think it kept me from greater\ntemptations, for I was a poor, forlorn child, with no one to keep me\ngood.\u201d\n\nPretty Belle looked prettier than ever as she listened, and a bright\ntear stood in either eye like a drop of dew on a blue flower. It touched\nher very much to learn that her little act of childish charity had been\nso sweet and helpful to this lonely girl, and now lived so freshly in\nher grateful memory. It showed her, suddenly, how precious little deeds\nof love and sympathy are; how strong to bless, how easy to perform, how\ncomfortable to recall. Her heart was very full and tender just then, and\nthe lesson sunk deep into it never to be forgotten.\n\nShe sat a long time watching flowers bud and blossom under Lizzie's\nskilful fingers, and then hurried home to tell all her glad news to\nmamma.\n\nIf the next day had not been full of most delightfully exciting events,\nBelle might have felt some anxiety about her wreath, for hour after hour\nwent by and nothing arrived from Lizzie.\n\nEvening came, and all was ready. Belle was dressed, and looked so lovely\nthat mamma declared she needed nothing more. But Marie insisted that\nthe grand effect would be ruined without the garland among the sunshiny\nhair. Belle had time now to be anxious, and waited with growing\nimpatience for the finishing touch to her charming toilette.\n\n\u201cI must be downstairs to receive, and can't wait another moment; so\nput in the blue pompon and let me go,\u201d she said at last, with a sigh\nof disappointment, for the desire to look beautiful that night in\nSomebody's eyes had increased four-fold.\n\nWith a tragic gesture, Marie was about to adjust the pompon when the\nquick tap of a crutch came down the hall, and Lizzie hurried in, flushed\nand breathless, but smiling happily as she uncovered the box she carried\nwith a look of proud satisfaction.\n\nA general \u201cAh!\u201d of admiration arose as Belle, mamma, and Marie surveyed\nthe lovely wreath that lay before them; and when it was carefully\narranged on the bright head that was to wear it, Belle blushed with\npleasure. Mamma said: \u201cIt is more beautiful than any Paris could have\nsent us;\u201d and Marie clasped her hands theatrically, sighing, with her\nhead on one side:\n\n\u201cTruly, yes; mademoiselle is now adorable!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am so glad you like it. I did my very best and worked all night, but\nI had to beg one spray from Estelle, or, with all my haste, I could not\nhave finished in time,\u201d said Lizzie, refreshing her weary eyes with a\nlong, affectionate gaze at the pretty figure before her.\n\nA fold of the airy skirt was caught on one of the blue clusters, and\nLizzie knelt down to arrange it as she spoke. Belle leaned toward her\nand said softly: \u201cMoney alone can't pay you for this kindness; so tell\nme how I can best serve you. This is the happiest night of my life, and\nI want to make every one feel glad also.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen don't talk of paying me, but promise that I may make the flowers\nyou wear on your wedding-day,\u201d whispered Lizzie, kissing the kind hand\nheld out to help her rise, for on it she saw a brilliant ring, and in\nthe blooming, blushing face bent over her she read the tender little\nstory that Somebody had told Belle that day.\n\n\u201cSo you shall! and I'll keep this wreath all my life for your sake,\ndear,\u201d answered Belle, as her full heart bubbled over with pitying\naffection for the poor girl who would never make a bridal garland for\nherself.\n\nBelle kept her word, even when she was in a happy home of her own; for\nout of the dead roses bloomed a friendship that brightened Lizzie's\nlife; and long after the blue garland was faded Belle remembered the\nhelpful little lesson that taught her to read the faces poverty\ntouches with a pathetic eloquence, which says to those who look,\n\u201cForget-me-not.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
