    "body": "We stood before the airlock, the old man and I, and watched them go\nout. Ellison was a granite man and I was just the lad who threw the\nswitches.\n\nI was new at it. They had sent me out with a pat on the back and a\ncommission, but I didn't feel like a Mercury run officer. Mining\nuranium on the Sun's firstling was no job for a green kid of\ntwenty-two. Outside were lakes of molten zinc and a temperature of 790\ndegrees Fahr.\n\nNo part of that temperature seeped into us, but just knowing it was\nout there was spine-chilling. I am not being facetious. To keep from\nthinking of the hot face we thought of the cold face, and you can't\nimagine extremes of cold without feeling shivery. Out on the cold face\nwere other miners, working under conditions I wouldn't wish on my worst\nenemy. They had the cold of open space to contend with, and a little of\n_that_ seeped in.\n\nThe Commander was passing out advice to each of the miners as they\nstepped into the lock.\n\n\"Murphy, it's uranium we want. We're not zoologists. The next time you\ngo specimen chasing--\"\n\n\"But it looked like a frog, Chief. I swear it did.\"\n\n\"You know damn well no froglike animal could hop around on red-hot\nrocks.\"\n\n\"I won't let him out of my sight this time, sir,\" said the miner at\nMurphy's heels.\n\n\"Thank you, Haines. He needs a nurse, but do what you can.\"\n\nFive miners stepped out, each with a glance from Ellison which said\nas plain as words that he would walk beside them until they came back\nin again. The old man had so much quiet strength that he could split\noff simulacra of himself, and send them out through the airlock by\njust passing out advice. He moved like a living presence over the\nsemi-molten Mercurian crust beside each of his men, fretting when a\ncoupling slipped or mysterious stirrings caused the lads to look at one\nanother with a wild surmise.\n\nHe knew that the merciless heat beating down did something to the\nscarred and cracked surface rocks which made them seem to buckle\nand split up into little leaping ghosts, and half his warnings were\ndirected against \"heat-devils\" and other optical illusions.\n\nWhen the last man had passed out he turned to me with a wry smile.\n\"Dave, speaking as a psychiatrist, and without knowing for sure, I've a\nhunch there is too much tension inside of you.\"\n\nThe old man actually was a psychiatrist. You have to be pretty nearly\neverything to qualify as a Mercury run commander and Ellison's\nknowledge started with Aasen and ended with Zwolle. There were some\ngaps in between, but not many, and he frequently surprised me by\npulling rabbits out of those.\n\nWe went down into the cuddy and the old man brought out some real smoky\nScotch, and we had at least three while a strained look came into his\nface. One of these days someone is going to stop putting bulkhead\nchronometers in the cuddies of Mercury run spaceships. Men have to go\nout and Commanders have to wait, and if an officer can't get his mind\noff the seconds in a cuddy what chance has he of relaxing at all?\n\nHanging on the corrugated metal bulkhead were curios from all over\nthe Solar System, and I tried to interest myself in the things the\nCommander had collected in his travels. A dried Venusian weejee head\nlooks pretty grotesque, but so does a deep-sea fish from home, and when\nyou've seen both dozens of times--\n\nA sudden vibrant humming made me spill a jigger of Scotch on my liberty\nuniform. The lad who was taking my place at the lock control was\nbuzzing the old man from the \"peel off\" room. Ellison swung about, and\nbarked into the auxiliary circuit audiocoil. \"Well?\"\n\n\"The men have returned, sir.\"\n\n\"All right. Keep the inner locks closed and watch the insulators.\nRawley is taking over.\"\n\n\n\nBetween the outer and inner locks we had to cool off the men a little.\nWhen they stepped in from the crust the sheath couplings on their\nnon-combustible suits had to be sprayed over with liquid air.\n\nWe went up in the jacket-lift with our knees braced and down the stern\npassageway to the \"peel off\" room, the old man striding on ahead of\nme. Had I stopped to reflect I might have realized there was trouble\nbrewing. The old man wasn't psychic exactly, but his hunches came out\npat.\n\nBefore I looked through the lock port my nerves were merely jumpy, but\nwhen I actually saw Murphy standing in the freeze vault enveloped in\nsmoke and sizzle I nearly passed out from shock.\n\nMurphy was waving his arms up and down and the man behind him was\nmaking frantic signs to us. The frog was dangling by its long legs from\nthe Irishman's gloved right hand. It was about three feet in height.\nEvery time he raised it up it tried to leap in his hand, and twisted\nits eyes around.\n\nSome quirk of parallel evolution had given it a froglike face, webbed\nfeet and long, powerful hindlimbs. But, of course, it wasn't a frog. It\nwas a Mercurian animal, and my stomach went tight ten seconds after I\nlaid eyes on it.\n\nI've said that I was just a green kid. The old man thought otherwise,\nbut he was wrong and I proceeded to prove it. I turned on the freeze\nconduits. Liquid air poured into the vault over Murphy and he stopped\ngesticulating. He just stood there looking at me through the eye-piece\nof his helmet.\n\nMurphy had gone out at the risk of his life and brought back a living\nMercurian animal. When he perceived that I had frozen that frog to a\ncrisp something must have gone dead inside him. When he came in through\nthe inner locks his couplings were coated with frost and there was a\nlook of anguish on the upper part of his face. Behind the eye-piece his\nfeatures seemed all wrenched apart. From his gloved right hand the frog\nstill dangled, but its squirmings had ceased. Its limbs were rigid, its\nstalked eyes frozen shut.\n\nWith shaking fingers Murphy removed his helmet and started peeling off\nhis suit, his gaze riveted on my face. The other miners stood watching\nhim as though fearful of what he might do.\n\nThe old man laid a hand on my arm. \"You'd better go below, Dave.\"\n\nMurphy shook his head. \"No, no, let the lad stay.\"\n\nHe had laid the frog on the deck and was pushing his suit down below\nhis knees. I noticed that his features were twitching, but I thought he\nwas making an effort to control his anger until he came up out of that\ncrouch with all his strength riding on his fists.\n\nHe clipped me on the side of the head, and delivered a blow to my\nmidriff which sent me reeling back against the bulkhead.\n\nThe old man leapt between us. \"Watch yourself, Murphy,\" he thundered.\n\"I'm still in command here.\"\n\nMurphy spat on the deck, a slow flush creeping up over his face. \"I\njust can't figure it,\" he muttered. \"I saw an infant once without one,\nbut its skull tapered and it had to be fed through a tube.\"\n\nI had always liked Murphy, but suddenly I saw red. I jumped him,\nand for a minute it was touch and go. We rolled over on the deck,\nexchanging hammer blows. He was hampered by the tangle his legs were\nin, but he made good use of his fists.\n\nThe old man had to intervene again. He accomplished it by backing up\nhis tuggings with profanity. He cast aspersions on our ancestry, and\nthreatened us with the psycho-lash.\n\nI'm hot-tempered, but I cool off quickly. The instant I realized I was\nmaking it tough for the old man I struggled to my feet, and held out my\nhand.\n\n\"Any time you're ready, Murphy,\" I said.\n\nThe Irishman rose groggily, shaking his head to clear it. He stood\nfor a minute staring incredulously at my extended palm, his eyebrows\ntwitching. Then his own hand went out and locked with mine.\n\n\"I guess I was a bit hasty, lad,\" he said.\n\n\n\nTen minutes later Sylvia was placing cool pads on my face, one on each\ncheek, and shaking her head over my blackened eye. \"I'm not really\nsorry for you, Dave,\" she said. \"You apparently _enjoy_ lashing out\nwith your fists. You just used that frog as an excuse.\"\n\nPerhaps I should have mentioned sooner that there was a woman on board.\nA slim and attractive girl with coppery hair named Sylvia Varner was\nvisiting us for five days consecutively. But she had come out on the\ncrew-shift cruiser _Aquila_ which was berthed right alongside of us on\nthe semi-molten crust.\n\nWomen are out of place on Mercury run ships, and if I were taking\nfictional liberties with this record I'd leave her out. But facts are\nfacts, and the feminine zig-zag had a lot to do with the way the frog\nbrought us all to the brink of despair. Without her it would have been\nless though, but less exciting, too, and, of course, for romantic\nreasons I was glad she had come. She happened to be Ellison's niece,\nand my fiancee, and had a kid brother working on the metallurgical\nstaff.\n\n\"But it isn't a frog,\" I said, irritably. \"It's a Mercurian animal. And\nI don't blame Murphy for sailing into me.\"\n\n\"You're being very charitable,\" she said. \"He tried to kill you.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I said. \"For a minute he went berserk. But what would\n_you_ do if you bagged the first Mercurian animal ever seen and a dumb\nkid turned it into a museum piece? If Murphy could have brought that\nfrog back to Earth alive the National Geographic Society would have\nsmothered him with medals.\"\n\n\"But won't it thaw out, Dave?\"\n\n\"It's limper than a rag right now,\" I said. \"But it is also dead as a\ndoornail.\"\n\nSylvia's brow crinkled. \"I should think a Mercurian animal would have\nto be plated like an armadillo. I should think it would need some sort\nof air-cooling system and a--\"\n\n\"Hold on,\" I said. \"You're jumping to a priori conclusions. We'll start\nwith the animal. It _is_ froglike, so conditions on Mercury must favor\nthe development of slender, agile quadrupeds with powerful hindlimbs.\nSince Mercury is flecked with semi-molten 'marsh patches' its froglike\nappearance does not surprise me. We can only speculate as to its\nhabits, but it's probably oviparous, and has a brief life-cycle.\n\n\"Now, in hot baths with carefully regulated approaches human beings\nhave been able to stand degrees of heat above the boiling point of\nwater. Back in the eighteenth century a Frenchman named Chamouni the\nIncombustible entered an oven containing a raw leg of mutton, and\nremained there until the meat was completely cooked. Medical history\nrecords hundreds of similar cases.\"\n\n\"But what has that to do with Murphy's frog?\"\n\n\"Don't you see? If human beings can build up all that resistance in a\nfew minutes what's to stop a _rapidly breeding_ Mercurian animal from\nacquiring ten times as much immunity in fifty thousand generations?\nWith already immune invertebrates to start with natural selection could\ngive even a highly evolved, meaty-fleshed animal plenty of resistance.\"\n\nI was feeling distinctly proud of myself when Sylvia countered with:\n\"You said the sides of its body and its hindlimbs were covered with\nfine, reddish hairs. Villosities was the term you used. How could\nnatural selection build up immunity in hair?\"\n\nI could have brought up another player, but I wanted her to smooth\nmy forehead instead. So I leaned back with a sigh and refrained from\npointing out that chitin was slow-burning at best, and that the only\nhairy frog on Earth--Trichobatatrachus robustus from West Africa--lived\nup to its name.\n\nShe sat on the arm of my chair and leaned forward and for a minute I\nthought I was going to get my wish. But all she did was kiss me. She\nleaned her lips against mine and for about three minutes a pleasant\ntingling surged through me. Then I began to grow restless. I couldn't\nbreathe and her lips were no longer warm and vibrant.\n\nI had to move her face to one side in order to inhale, and the instant\nI did so she swayed and her elbows descended on my chest.\n\n\n\nA chill coursed through me. Her arms were rigid and she seemed almost\nweightless. Alarmed, I rose, grasped her wrists and eased her gently\ndown into the chair.\n\nShe just sat there staring up at me, her face a petrified mask and her\nbody so utterly still that it did something to sound. In place of the\nfaint susurrous which occupied space gives forth the chair seemed to be\nenveloped in a kind of auditory vacuum which chilled me to the core of\nmy being.\n\nI can't remember how long I stood there with horror slapping at my\nbrain like the tides of some cold, dead moon. I only know that I turned\nat last and went stumbling from her presence with one thought uppermost\nin my mind.\n\nI must get medical aid to her quickly, before that trance could deepen,\nbefore it could endanger her life.\n\nGoing up in the jacket-lift to the sick bay I kept visualizing Ned\nDawson's face. Dawson was a strong-jawed, competent physician with\nyears of experience behind him and I was sure he would know what to do.\n\nHe was usually in the sick bay attending to the many little sprains\nand bruises the men brought in with them from the crust. There was a\nflicker of violet light as the jacket-lift hummed to a stop. I stepped\nout and raced down a cold-lighted passageway to the \"drug shop,\" my\nbreath coming fast.\n\nOn meta-glass chairs amidst a faint odor of antiseptics two men sat\nfrozen, but I thought they were asleep. I went straight through the\nwaiting space with scarcely a glance at them, and burst into the sick\nbay unannounced.\n\nDawson was there all right, but he was bent nearly double, frozen in\nthe act of applying a gauze bandage to the badly cut ankle of a miner\nwho stood contemplating his navel like a schizophrene, his head sunken\non his chest.\n\n\n\nFor an instant I just stood there gasping, too stunned to realize that\nI was staring at a physician who could no longer heal. It wasn't until\nI went up to him and discovered that his body was cold and his face a\nfrozen mask that my brain started to soak up horror.\n\nI went reeling out into the passageway like a drunken man and tried to\nlocate the commander, and found him at last in the control room with\nhis body glinting in light-silvered dust.\n\nHe was standing before one of the _Lyra's_ translucent windows staring\nout upon the steamy Mercurian landscape, his arms folded on his\nchest. When I touched him he swayed and when I looked into his eyes I\nperceived that the pupils were set in a fixed stare, and covered with a\ndull, grayish film.\n\nMurphy was standing beside him. The Irishman had evidently come in\nfor orders and stiffened to immobility with a pipe in his mouth and a\nslightly provoked look on his face, as though my stupidity still riled\nhim.\n\nA nightmare unreality lengthened the minutes which followed into\nunevenly-spaced eternities filled with a steadily mounting dread. In\nthe more crowded parts of the ship frozen men clustered in little\nqueues. Every member of the atomotor crew stood frozen at his post. The\nstarboard watch looked like statues carved in bronze and in the chain\nlocker room were three crewmen whose muscular contortions conveyed an\nillusion of motion as they tugged at windlasses which had ceased to\nturn.\n\nMy palms were wet and I was trembling in every limb when I completed\nmy inspection of the ship. It was especially bad going back in the\njacket-lift to the commander's cabin. In the dark fore-hold I had\nglimpsed obscure, rigid shadows which had unnerved me more than all the\nfrozen, brittle men illumed by cold light in the crew spaces fore and\naft.\n\nWhen I stepped from the jacket-lift a voice said: \"They only _seem_\nbrittle, Rawley. Actually they are still soft and flabby, like all the\ninhabitants of the third planet.\"\n\nIt was a telepathic voice, but I didn't know that. I thought it was a\nhuman voice speaking close to my ear. Appalled, I swung about.\n\nThe frog was peering around a bend in the passageway, its stalked\neyes pointing toward the lift. I fought a desire to scream as it\nleapt agilely toward me. It seemed to be grinning up at me. Its wet,\nyellowish lips were split in a grimace which gave it the appearance of\nbeing convulsed with mirth.\n\n\"Why are you trembling, Rawley?\" it said. \"Surely you expected to find\nintelligent life on at least _one_ of the planets.\"\n\n\"You mean you are--\"\n\n\"Intelligent, yes. So intelligent that you seem very primitive to us.\nIt is a hindrance, in a way. Too wide a gulf.\"\n\n\"Then _you_ did this,\" I choked. \"You--you froze every man on this\nship.\"\n\n\"Froze? Oh, I see what you mean. It is unfortunate that I am\ncompelled to use your mental concepts to think with. You are giving\nmy thoughts a verbal twist peculiar to yourself. You see, Rawley,\nI can correlate your fugitive reactions to a given phenomenon with\neverything experienced by you from the day of your birth. By simply\ntuning in on your thoughts I can get your--your slant. Not merely your\nthought images, Rawley, but all the little twists and turns of your\nfamiliar speech. Fortunately you have telepathic powers, too. Somewhat\nrudimentary, but adequate.\"\n\nThe frog's eyes quivered. \"Don't glare at me, Rawley. I have no\nintention of harming you.\"\n\n\"You harmed _her_,\" I groaned.\n\n\"I harmed--Oh, I see. The girl, eh? We propagate by fission, so we've\nbeen spared all that. I didn't harm her, Rawley. All I did was diminish\nher mass. I had to do that to warm myself.\n\n\"Rawley, I was almost gone. I can stand a little cold, but that liquid\nair--\"\n\n\"You did _what_ to her?\"\n\n\"Diminished her mass. Now keep your shirt on, Rawley. I need the glow\nto warm me. Needed it badly. For real warmth there's nothing like the\nradiant energies imprisoned in kalium. The bodies of terrestrials are\nideal sources of heat in all respects; not only because they contain\nkalium, but because the other elements of which they are composed are\namong the easiest to tap.\n\n\"No harm done, you understand. I can radiate back subatomic particles\nat any time. All I did was squeeze out the radiations in a soft,\nglutinous mass. You don't have to bombard atoms or surround them with\nwater-jackets to strip them, Rawley. With a little patience you can\nsqueeze out their energies the way you squeeze toothpaste from a tube.\n\n\"My body has soaked up a fine, tingling warmth from all those frozen\nterrestrials. They are mere atomic husks now, but perfectly preserved\nand restorable at any time.\"\n\nI scarcely heard it. Something was happening to the ship. Beneath my\nfeet the deck was unmistakably swaying, and there were twangings and\ncreakings all along the passageway which could only mean one thing.\n\nThe ship was in motion!\n\n\n\nThe frog had noticed it, too. It stiffened abruptly and cocked its head\nas though listening, its stalked eyes squinting shut.\n\nIn paralyzed astonishment I stood staring at the vibrating overhead,\nwondering what in hell it could mean. Had one of the frozen crewmen\nregained the use of his limbs and attempted an emergency take-off?\nI strained my ears, but could detect no atomotor drone, or other\nindication that we were rocketing upward from the crust.\n\n\"No, Rawley,\" the frog's voice came again, vibrant but strained. \"No,\nwe are not leaving the planet. I think I know what is happening.\nRawley, you have an instrument which enables you to see the ship as\nthough it were being viewed from a distance by someone out on the\nplanet. Horiz--horizonscope. Suppose we see for ourselves.\"\n\nWe descended in the jacket-lift together, the frog bracing its knees\nprecisely as the commander had done long ago in another world.\n\nI don't know how I lived through the next ten minutes. When I stood in\nthe control room and looked in the horizonscope I saw a sight which I\nshall never forget if I live to be a hundred.\n\nOn both sides of the ship were dozens of froglike shapes moving in\nsingle file, their bodies bent nearly double as though they were\nstraining at the leash.\n\nAll about them swirled steamy vapors and flickering tongues of flame.\nA blood-red sun, so gigantic that it spanned a fifth of the sky, hung\nlike a vast, glowing eye directly overhead, dazzling my pupils as I\nstared. Even in the horizonscope it seemed huge, blinding.\n\nThe scene was weird beyond all imagining--weird and unutterably\nterrifying.\n\n\"Rawley, they are moving the ship. They are using magnetic tow lines\nand making a mighty good job of it.\"\n\n\"Where--where are they taking us?\" I gasped.\n\nThe frog's reply was utterly bewildering. \"We'll label it terrestrial\nfauna--habitat group. We'll take the ship right into the museum.\nLarge-brained bipeds from the third planet, stooping above their\nartifacts in perfectly natural attitudes. Magnificent.\n\n\"Mustn't let sunlight touch them. It's curious I didn't think of this\nwhen I absorbed their energies. My one thought was to warm myself, but\nnecessity is the mother of invention. They'll honor me for this. I'll\n_head_ the next expedition. My instructions were imbecilic. 'Observe\nall their habits and then mummify them.'\n\n\"What good are shriveled specimens? So long as sunlight doesn't\ntouch them they'll keep this way for a thousand years. This one has\nbeen--helpful. Oh, enormously. Just as well I didn't tap him.\n\n\"I mustn't let him suspect that I couldn't--can't. I've absorbed too\nmuch radiance as it is. My energies are brimming over. He thinks I can\nstill diminish his mass. Might have to kill him if he knew.\n\n\"Kill him. I could do that, of course. But I'd hate to lose one of\nthese specimens.\"\n\nIt hit me all at once, with the force of a physical blow. There was\nsomething that the frog didn't know. It didn't know that I could listen\nin on its private thoughts. It thought it could shut off its mind from\nme. Hitting me also with force was the sudden realization that when in\nclose proximity to it I had telepathic powers which were first rate, as\ngood as its own.\n\nWait a minute--better. Because it didn't seem aware of what I\nwas thinking now. So we were just animals to it, eh? Big-brained\nbipeds--_specimens_. I was edging away from it and toward the control\npanel, very cautiously.\n\n\n\nKeeping my excitement down wasn't easy. There was a lot of anger mixed\nup with it, and more fear than a man of courage likes to own up to. I\nwondered how strong the magnetic tow lines were. Would they hold the\nship if I blasted out all the rocket jets and started the atomotors ten\nseconds later?\n\nIt didn't seem likely. If I could reach the control panel nine-tenths\nof the battle would be won. Nearer to it I inched, and nearer.\n\nThe frog stirred just as my hand touched the rocket control. I swung\ndown on it hard. Something in my brain started babbling as I swung my\nother hand toward the atomotor emergency bulb and splintered it with my\nnaked palm.\n\nThe whole ship seemed to explode, carrying the top of my skull with it.\nI was no longer in a Mercury run spaceship screaming defiance at a frog.\n\nI was far out in space between massive gaseous suns, red and blue\nand mottled, with island universes to right and left of me and a\nlong-tailed comet sweeping down from a ragged hole on the sky.\n\nWhen I crawled through the fence into my own backyard again I was\nbruised and partly numb, but the ship was plowing steadily through the\nvoid, and Mercury was so far away from it that it was a mere fly-speck\nmottling on the dull-corona-encircled disk of the sun.\n\nThe frog? Yes, it was still with us, but all the cockiness had gone out\nof it. It came to me, as meek as a lamb, and laid all its cards on the\ntable.\n\nIt would be the specimen now. So long as we didn't cast it out through\nthe air-locks to freeze in the void it would consent to be exhibited\nin every museum on Earth. Only the museums would have to be roofless,\nbecause it would need the sunlight.\n\nIt promised not to diminish the mass of a single human being on Earth.\nAll it needed was our sunlight. Locked up in the _Lyra_ and freezing\nto death it had been compelled to tap the nearest energy source, which\nhappened to be us.\n\nBut on Earth it would tap the sunlight. It pointed out that the\nsunlight falling on one square foot of Earth would keep one of our big\npower plants running for a year, if we knew as much as the Mercurians\ndid about radiant heat.\n\n\"I'll be no trouble at all, Rawley. And if you wish, I'll show you\nhow to convert sunlight into useful energy. You won't need so many\ncyclotrons then. Before _I'd_ monkey with anything as unpredictable as\na skinless atom I'd go jump in a lake.\"\n\nI was no longer listening. There was something I had left unfinished\nand it suddenly seemed more important to me than anything a frog could\nsay or do.\n\nGoing down in the jacket-lift to Sylvia I kept trying to recall just\nhow I felt when it had cheated me out of something I was entitled to.\n\nIt didn't seem right to leave a kiss dangling in midair, and I was sure\nthat Sylvia was feeling frustrated, too.\n\nShe was. She came into my arms in utter silence, and we did the kiss up\nbrown, and stored it away in our memories for when we were eighty-eight.\n\n\"Darling,\" she said. \"I'm glad we thought of that.\"\n\nI felt better almost at once. They had sent me out from Earth with\na pat on the back and a commission, and I was returning with the\ncommander's niece in my arms and a story in my brain which the news\nsyndicates would certainly want.\n\nI'd ask a good price for it. Lunar honeymoons were expensive, and\nalthough Sylvia wasn't extravagant she liked orchids as well as the\nnext girl and was just the right height to wear sables with grace.\n\n\n\n\n",
