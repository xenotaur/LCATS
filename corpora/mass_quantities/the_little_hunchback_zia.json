BENDA\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it came to pass nigh upon\nnineteen hundred and sixteen years ago\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE LITTLE HUNCHBACK ZIA\n\nThe little hunchback Zia toiled slowly up the steep road, keeping in the\ndeepest shadows, even though the night had long fallen. Sometimes he\nstaggered with weariness or struck his foot against a stone and\nsmothered his involuntary cry of pain. He was so full of terror that he\nwas afraid to utter a sound which might cause any traveler to glance\ntoward him. This he feared more than any other thing--that some man or\nwoman might look at him too closely. If such a one knew much and had\nkeen eyes, he or she might in some way guess even at what they might not\nyet see.\n\nSince he had fled from the village in which his wretched short life had\nbeen spent he had hidden himself in thickets and behind walls or rocks\nor bushes during the day, and had only come forth at night to stagger\nalong his way in the darkness. If he had not managed to steal some food\nbefore he began his journey and if he had not found in one place some\nbeans dropped from a camel's feeding-bag, he would have starved. For\nfive nights he had been wandering on, but in his desperate fear he had\nlost count of time. When he had left the place he had called his home he\nhad not known where he was going or where he might hide himself in the\nend. The old woman with whom he had lived and for whom he had begged and\nlabored had driven him out with a terror as great as his own.\n\n\"Begone!\" she had cried in a smothered shriek. \"Get thee gone, accursed!\nEven now thou mayest have brought the curse upon me also. A creature\nborn a hunchback comes on earth with the blight of Jehovah's wrath upon\nhim. Go far! Go as far as thy limbs will carry thee! Let no man come\nnear enough to thee to see it! If thou go far away before it is known,\nit will be forgotten that I have harbored thee.\"\n\nHe had stood and looked at her in the silence of the dead, his immense,\nblack Syrian eyes growing wider and wider with childish horror. He had\nalways regarded her with slavish fear. What he was to her he did not\nknow; neither did he know how he had fallen into her hands. He knew only\nthat he was not of her blood or of her country and that he yet seemed to\nhave always belonged to her. In his first memory of his existence, a\nlittle deformed creature rolling about on the littered floor of her\nuncleanly hovel, he had trembled at the sound of her voice and had\nobeyed it like a beaten spaniel puppy. When he had grown older he had\nseen that she lived upon alms and thievery and witchlike evil doings\nthat made all decent folk avoid her. She had no kinsfolk or friends, and\nonly such visitors as came to her in the dark hours of night and seemed\nto consult with her as she sat and mumbled strange incantations while\nshe stirred a boiling pot. Zia had heard of soothsayers and dealers with\nevil spirits, and at such hours was either asleep on his pallet in a far\ncorner or, if he lay awake, hid his face under his wretched covering and\nstopped his ears. Once when she had drawn near and found his large eyes\nopen and staring at her in spellbound terror, she had beaten him\nhorribly and cast him into the storm raging outside.\n\nA strange passion in her seemed her hatred of his eyes. She could not\nendure that he should look at her as if he were thinking. He must not\nlet his eyes rest on her for more than a moment when he spoke. He must\nkeep them fixed on the ground or look away from her. From his babyhood\nthis had been so. A hundred times she had struck him when he was too\nyoung to understand her reason. The first strange lesson he had learned\nwas that she hated his eyes and was driven to fury when she found them\nresting innocently upon her. Before he was three years old he had\nlearned this thing and had formed the habit of looking down upon the\nearth as he limped about. For long he thought that his eyes were as\nhideous as his body was distorted. In her frenzies she told him that\nevil spirits looked out from them and that he was possessed of devils.\nWithout thought of rebellion or resentment he accepted with timorous\nhumility, as part of his existence, her taunts at his twisted limbs.\nWhat use in rebellion or anger? With the fatalism of the East he\nresigned himself to that which was. He had been born a deformity, and\neven his glance carried evil. This was life. He knew no other. Of his\norigin he knew nothing except that from the old woman's rambling\noutbursts he had gathered that he was of Syrian blood and a homeless\noutcast.\n\nBut though he had so long trained himself to look downward that it had\nat last become an effort to lift his heavily lashed eyelids, there came\na time when he learned that his eyes were not so hideously evil as his\ntask-mistress had convinced him that they were. When he was only seven\nyears old she sent him out to beg alms for her, and on the first day of\nhis going forth she said a strange thing, the meaning of which he could\nnot understand.\n\n\"Go not forth with thine eyes bent downward on the dust. Lift them, and\nlook long at those from whom thou askest alms. Lift them and look as I\nsee thee look at the sky when thou knowest not I am near thee. I have\nseen thee, hunchback. Gaze at the passers-by as if thou sawest their\nsouls and asked help of them.\"\n\nShe said it with a fierce laugh of derision, but when in his\nastonishment he involuntarily lifted his gaze to hers, she struck at\nhim, her harsh laugh broken in two.\n\n\"Not at me, hunchback! Not at me! At those who are ready to give!\" she\ncried out.\n\nHe had gone out stunned with amazement. He wondered so greatly that when\nhe at last sat down by the roadside under a fig-tree he sat in a dream.\nHe looked up at the blueness above him as he always did when he was\nalone. His eyelids did not seem heavy when he lifted them to look at the\nsky. The blueness and the billows of white clouds brought rest to him,\nand made him forget what he was. The floating clouds were his only\nfriends. There was something--yes, there was something, he did not know\nwhat. He wished he were a cloud himself, and could lose himself at last\nin the blueness as the clouds did when they melted away. Surely the\nblueness was the something.\n\nThe soft, dull pad of camel's feet approached upon the road without his\nhearing them. He was not roused from his absorption until the camel\nstopped its tread so near him that he started and looked up. It was\nnecessary that he should look up a long way. He was a deformed little\nchild, and the camel was a tall and splendid one, with rich trappings\nand golden bells. The man it carried was dressed richly, and the\nexpression of his dark face was at once restless and curious. He was\nbending down and staring at Zia as if he were something strange.\n\n\"What dost thou see, child?\" he said at last, and he spoke almost in a\nbreathless whisper. \"What art thou waiting for?\"\n\nZia stumbled to his feet and held out his bag, frightened, because he\nhad never begged before and did not know how, and if he did not carry\nback money and food, he would be horribly beaten again.\n\n\"Alms! alms!\" he stammered. \"Master--Lord--I beg for--for her who keeps\nme. She is poor and old. Alms, great lord, for a woman who is old!\"\n\nThe man with the restless face still stared. He spoke as if unaware that\nhe uttered words and as if he were afraid.\n\n\"The child's eyes!\" he said. \"I cannot pass him by! What is it? I must\nnot be held back. But the unearthly beauty of his eyes!\" He caught his\nbreath as he spoke. And then he seemed to awaken as one struggling\nagainst a spell.\n\n\"What is thy name?\" he asked.\n\nZia also had lost his breath. What had the man meant when he spoke of\nhis eyes?\n\nHe told his name, but he could answer no further questions. He did not\nknow whose son he was; he had no home; of his mistress he knew only that\nher name was Judith and that she lived on alms.\n\nEven while he related these things he remembered his lesson, and,\ndropping his eyelids, fixed his gaze on the camel's feet.\n\n\"Why dost thou cast thine eyes downward?\" the man asked in a troubled\nand intense voice.\n\nZia could not speak, being stricken with fear and the dumbness of\nbewilderment. He stood quite silent, and as he lifted his eyes and let\nthem rest on the stranger's own, they became large with tears--big,\npiteous tears.\n\n\"Why?\" persisted the man, anxiously. \"Is it because thou seest evil in\nmy soul?\"\n\n\"No, no!\" sobbed Zia. \"One taught me to look away because I am hideous\nand--my eyes--are evil.\"\n\n\"Evil!\" said the stranger. \"They have lied to thee.\" He was trembling as\nhe spoke. \"A man who has been pondering on sin dare not pass their\nbeauty by. They draw him, and show him his own soul. Having seen them, I\nmust turn my camel's feet backward and go no farther on this road which\nwas to lead me to a black deed.\" He bent down, and dropped a purse into\nthe child's alms-bag, still staring at him and breathing hard. \"They\nhave the look,\" he muttered, \"of eyes that might behold the Messiah. Who\nknows? Who knows?\" And he turned his camel's head, still shuddering a\nlittle, and he rode away back toward the place from which he had come.\n\nThere was gold in the purse he had given, and when Zia carried it back\nto Judith, she snatched it from him and asked him many questions. She\nmade him repeat word for word all that had passed.\n\nAfter that he was sent out to beg day after day, and in time he vaguely\nunderstood that the old woman had spoken falsely when she had said that\nevil spirits looked forth hideously from his eyes. People often said that\nthey were beautiful, and gave him money because something in his gaze\ndrew them near to him. But this was not all. At times there were those\nwho spoke under their breath to one another of some wonder of light in\nthem, some strange luminousness which was not earthly.\n\n\"He surely sees that which we cannot. Perhaps when he is a man he will\nbe a great soothsayer and reader of the stars,\" he heard a woman whisper\nto a companion one day.\n\nThose who were evil were afraid to meet his gaze, and hated it as old\nJudith did, though, as he was not their servant, they dared not strike\nhim when he lifted his soft, heavy eyelids.\n\nBut Zia could not understand what people meant when they whispered about\nhim or turned away fiercely. A weight was lifted from his soul when he\nrealized that he was not as revolting as he had believed. And when\npeople spoke kindly to him he began to know something like happiness for\nthe first time in his life. He brought home so much in his alms-bag that\nthe old woman ceased to beat him and gave him more liberty. He was\nallowed to go out at night and sleep under the stars. At such times he\nused to lie and look up at the jeweled myriads until he felt himself\ndrawn upward and floating nearer and nearer to that unknown something\nwhich he felt also in the high blueness of the day.\n\nWhen he first began to feel as if some mysterious ailment was creeping\nupon him he kept himself out of Judith's way as much as possible. He\ndared not tell her that sometimes he could scarcely crawl from one place\nto another. A miserable fevered weakness became his secret. As the old\nwoman took no notice of him except when he brought back his day's\nearnings, it was easy to evade her. One morning, however, she fixed her\neyes on him suddenly and keenly.\n\n\"Why art thou so white?\" she said, and caught him by the arm, whirling\nhim toward the light. \"Art thou ailing?\"\n\n\"No! no!\" cried Zia.\n\nShe held him still for a few seconds, still staring.\n\n\"Thou art too white,\" she said. \"I will have no such whiteness. It is\nthe whiteness of--of an accursed thing. Get thee gone!\"\n\nHe went away, feeling cold and shaken. He knew he was white. One or two\nalmsgivers had spoken of it, and had looked at him a little fearfully.\nHe himself could see that the flesh of his thin body was becoming an\nunearthly color. Now and then he had shuddered as he looked at it\nbecause--because--There was one curse so horrible beyond all others that\nthe strongest man would have quailed in his dread of its drawing near\nhim. And he was a child, a twelve-year-old boy, a helpless little\nhunchback mendicant.\n\nWhen he saw the first white-and-red spot upon his flesh he stood still\nand stared at it, gasping, and the sweat started out upon him and rolled\ndown in great drops.\n\n\"Jehovah!\" he whispered, \"God of Israel! Thy servant is but a child!\"\n\nBut there broke out upon him other spots, and every time he found a new\none his flesh quaked, and he could not help looking at it in secret\nagain and again. Every time he looked it was because he hoped it might\nhave faded away. But no spot faded away, and the skin on the palms of\nhis hands began to be rough and cracked and to show spots also.\n\n\nIn a cave on a hillside near the road where he sat and begged there\nlived a deathly being who, with face swathed in linen and with bandaged\nstumps of limbs, hobbled forth now and then, and came down to beg also,\nbut always keeping at a distance from all human creatures, and, as he\napproached the pitiful, rattled loudly his wooden clappers, wailing out:\n\"Unclean! Unclean!\"\n\nIt was the leper Berias, whose hopeless tale of awful days was almost\ndone. Zia himself had sometimes limped up the hillside and laid some of\nhis own poor food upon a stone near his cave so that he might find it.\nOne day he had also taken a branch of almond-blossom in full flower, and\nhad laid it by the food. And when he had gone away and stood at some\ndistance watching to see the poor ghost come forth to take what he had\ngiven, he had seen him first clutch at the blossoming branch and fall\nupon his face, holding it to his breast, a white, bound, shapeless\nthing, sobbing, and uttering hoarse, croaking, unhuman cries. No\nalmsgiver but Zia had ever dreamed of bringing a flower to him who was\nforever cut off from all bloom and loveliness.\n\nIt was this white, shuddering creature that Zia remembered with the sick\nchill of horror when he saw the spots.\n\n\"Unclean! Unclean!\" he heard the cracked voice cry to the sound of the\nwooden clappers. \"Unclean! Unclean!\"\n\nJudith was standing at the door of her hovel one morning when Zia was\ngoing forth for the day. He had fearfully been aware that for days she\nhad been watching him as he had never known her to watch him before.\nThis morning she had followed him to the door, and had held him there a\nfew moments in the light with some harsh speech, keeping her eyes fixed\non him the while.\n\nEven as they so stood there fell upon the clear air of the morning a\nhollow, far-off sound--the sound of wooden clappers rattled together,\nand the hopeless crying of two words, \"Unclean! Unclean!\"\n\nThen silence fell. Upon Zia descended a fear beyond all power of words\nto utter. In his quaking young torment he lifted his eyes and met the\ngaze of the old woman as it flamed down upon him.\n\n\"Go within!\" she commanded suddenly, and pointed to the wretched room\ninside. He obeyed her, and she followed him, closing the door behind\nthem.\n\n\"Tear off thy garment!\" she ordered. \"Strip thyself to thy skin--to thy\nskin!\"\n\nHe shook from head to foot, his trembling hands almost refusing to obey\nhim. She did not touch him, but stood apart, glaring. His garments fell\nfrom him and lay in a heap at his feet, and he stood among them naked.\n\nOne look, and she broke forth, shaking with fear herself, into a\nbreathless storm of fury.\n\n\"Thou hast known this thing and hidden it!\" she raved. \"Leper! Leper!\nAccursed hunchback thing!\"\n\nAs he stood in his nakedness and sobbed great, heavy childish sobs, she\ndid not dare to strike him, and raged the more.\n\nIf it were known that she had harbored him, the priests would be upon\nher, and all that she had would be taken from her and burned. She would\nnot even let him put his clothes on in her house.\n\n\"Take thy rags and begone in thy nakedness! Clothe thyself on the\nhillside! Let none see thee until thou art far away! Rot as thou wilt,\nbut dare not to name me! Begone! begone! begone!\"\n\nAnd with his rags he fled naked through the doorway, and hid himself in\nthe little wood beyond.\n\nLater, as he went on his way, he had hidden himself in the daytime\nbehind bushes by the wayside or off the road; he had crouched behind\nrocks and boulders; he had slept in caves when he had found them; he had\nshrunk away from all human sight. He knew it could not be long before he\nwould be discovered, and then he would be shut up; and afterward he\nwould be as Berias until he died alone. Like unto Berias! To him it\nseemed as though surely never child had sobbed before as he sobbed,\nlying hidden behind his boulders, among his bushes, on the bare hill\namong the rocks.\n\n\nFor the first four nights of his wandering he had not known where he was\ngoing, but on this fifth night he discovered. He was on the way to\nBethlehem--beautiful little Bethlehem curving on the crest of the\nJudean mountains and smiling down upon the fairness of the fairest of\nsweet valleys, rich with vines and figs and olives and almond-trees. He\ndimly recalled stories he had overheard of its loveliness, and when he\nfound that he had wandered unknowingly toward it, he was aware of a\nfaint sense of peace. He had seen nothing of any other part of the world\nthan the poor village outside which the hovel of his bond-mistress had\nclung to a low hill. Since he was near it, he vaguely desired to see\nBethlehem.\n\nHe had learned of its nearness as he lay hidden in the undergrowth on\nthe mountain-side that he had begun to climb the night before. Awakening\nfrom sleep, he had heard many feet passing up the climbing road--the\nfeet of men and women and children, of camels and asses, and all had\nseemed to be of a procession ascending the mountainside. Lying flat upon\nthe earth, he had parted the bushes cautiously, and watched, and\nlistened to the shouts, cries, laughter, and talk of those who were near\nenough to be heard. So bit by bit he had heard the story of the passing\nthrong. The great Emperor Augustus, who, to the common herd seemed some\nstrange omnipotent in his remote and sumptuous paradise of Rome,\nhad issued a decree that all the world of his subjects should be\nenrolled, and every man, woman, and child must enroll himself in his own\ncity. And to the little town of Bethlehem all these travelers were\nwending their way, to the place of their nativity, in obedience to the\ngreat Caesar's command.\n\nAll through the day he watched them--men and women and children who\nbelonged to one another, who rode together on their beasts, or walked\ntogether hand in hand. Women on camels or asses held their little ones\nin their arms, or walked with the youngest slung on their backs. He\nheard boys laugh and talk with their fathers--boys of his own age, who\ntrudged merrily along, and now and again ran forward, shouting with\nglee. He saw more than one strong man swing his child up to his shoulder\nand bear him along as if he found joy in his burden. Boy and girl\ncompanions played as they went and made holiday of their journey; young\nmen or women who were friends, lovers, or brothers and sisters bore one\nanother company.\n\n\"No one is alone,\" said Zia, twisting his thin fingers together--\"no\none! no one! And there are no lepers. The great Caesar would not count a\nleper. Perhaps, if he saw one, he would command him to be put to death.\"\n\nAnd then he writhed upon the grass and sobbed again, his bent chest\nalmost bursting with his efforts to make no sound. He had always been\nalone--always, always; but this loneliness was such as no young human\nthing could bear. He was no longer alive; he was no longer a human\nbeing. Unclean! Unclean! Unclean!\n\nAt last he slept, exhausted, and past his piteous, prostrate childhood\nand helplessness the slow procession wound its way up the mountain road\ntoward the crescent of Bethlehem, knowing nothing of his nearness to its\nunburdened comfort and simple peace.\n\nWhen he awakened, the night had fallen, and he opened his eyes upon a\nhigh vault of blue velvet darkness strewn with great stars. He saw this\nat the first moment of his consciousness; then he realized that there\nwas no longer to be heard the sound either of passing hoofs or treading\nfeet. The travelers who had gone by during the day had probably reached\ntheir journey's end, and gone to rest in their tents, or had found\nrefuge in the inclosing khan that gave shelter to wayfarers and their\nbeasts of burden.\n\nBut though there was no human creature near, and no sound of human voice\nor human tread, a strange change had taken place in him. His loneliness\nhad passed away, and left him lying still and calm as though it had\nnever existed, as though the crushed and broken child who had plunged\nfrom a precipice of woe into deadly, exhausted sleep was only a vague\nmemory of a creature in a dark past dream.\n\nHad it been himself? Lying upon his back, seeing only the immensity of\nthe deep blue above him and the greatness of the stars, he scarcely\ndared to draw breath lest he should arouse himself to new anguish. It\nhad not been he who had so suffered; surely it had been another Zia.\nWhat had come upon him, what had come upon the world? All was so still\nthat it was as if the earth waited--as if it waited to hear some word\nthat would be spoken out of the great space in which it hung. He was not\nhungry or cold or tired. It was as if he had never staggered and\nstumbled up the mountain path and dropped shuddering, to hide behind the\nbushes before the daylight came and men could see his white face. Surely\nhe had rested long. He had never felt like this before, and he had never\nseen so wonderful a night. The stars had never been so many and so\nlarge. What made them so soft and brilliant that each one was almost\nlike a sun? And he strangely felt that each looked down at him as if it\nsaid the word, though he did not know what the word was. Why had he been\nso terror-stricken? Why had he been so wretched? There were no lepers;\nthere were no hunchbacks. There was only Zia, and he was at peace, and\nakin to the stars that looked down.\n\nHow heavenly still the waiting world was, how heavenly still! He lay and\nsmiled and smiled; perhaps he lay so for an hour. Then high, high above\nhe saw, or thought he saw, in the remoteness of the vault of blue a\nbrilliant whiteness float. Was it a strange snowy cloud or was he\ndreaming? It seemed to grow whiter, more brilliant. His breath came\nfast, and his heart beat trembling in his breast, because he had never\nseen clouds so strangely, purely brilliant. There was another, higher,\nfarther distant, and yet more dazzling still. Another and another showed\nits radiance until at last an arch of splendor seemed to stream across\nthe sky.\n\n\"It is like the glory of the ark of the covenant,\" he gasped, and threw\nhis arm across his blinded eyes, shuddering with rapture.\n\nHe could not uncover his face, and it was as he lay quaking with an\nunearthly joy that he first thought he heard sounds of music as remotely\ndistant as the lights.\n\n\"Is it on earth?\" he panted. \"Is it on earth?\"\n\nHe struggled to his knees. He had heard of miracles and wonders of old,\nand of the past ages when the sons of God visited the earth.\n\n\"Glory to God in the highest!\" he stammered again and again and again.\n\"Glory to the great Jehovah!\" and he touched his forehead seven times to\nthe earth.\n\nThen he beheld a singular thing. When he had gone to sleep a flock of\nsheep had been lying near him on the grass. The flock was still there,\nbut something seemed to be happening to it. The creatures were awakening\nfrom their sleep as if they had heard something. First one head was\nraised, and then another and another and another, until every head was\nlifted, and every one was turned toward a certain point as if listening.\nWhat were they listening for? Zia could see nothing, though he turned\nhis own face toward the climbing road and listened with them. The\nfloating radiance was so increasing in the sky that at this point of the\nmountain-side it seemed no longer to the night, and the far-away paeans\nheld him breathless with mysterious awe. Was the sound on earth? Where\ndid it come from? Where?\n\n\"Praised be Jehovah!\" he heard his weak and shaking young voice quaver.\n\nSome belated travelers were coming slowly up the road. He heard an ass's\nfeet and low voices.\n\nThe sheep heard them also. Had they been waiting for them? They rose one\nby one--the whole flock--to  their feet, and turned in a body toward the\napproaching sounds.\n\nZia stood up with them. He waited also, and it was as if at this moment\nhis soul so lifted itself that it almost broke away from his\nbody--almost.\n\nAround the curve an ass came slowly bearing a woman, and led by a man\nwho walked by his side. He was a man of sober years and walked wearily.\nZia's eyes grew wide with awe and wondering as he gazed, scarce\nbreathing.\n\nThe light upon the hillside was so softly radiant and so clear that he\ncould see that the woman's robe was blue and that she lifted her face to\nthe stars as she rode. It was a young face, and pale with the pallor of\nlilies, and her eyes were as stars of the morning. But this was not all.\nA radiance shone from her pure pallor, and bordering her blue robe and\nveil was a faint, steady glow of light. And as she passed the standing\nand waiting sheep, they slowly bowed themselves upon their knees before\nher, and so knelt until she had passed by and was out of sight. Then\nthey returned to their places, and slept as before.\n\nWhen she was gone, Zia found that he also was kneeling. He did not know\nwhen his knees had bent. He was faint with ecstasy.\n\n\n\"She goes to Bethlehem,\" he heard himself say as he had heard himself\nspeak before. \"I, too; I, too.\"\n\nHe stood a moment listening to the sound of the ass's retreating feet as\nit grew fainter in the distance. His breath came quick and soft. The\nlight had died away from the hillside, but the high-floating radiance\nseemed to pass to and fro in the heavens, and now and again he thought\nhe heard the faint, far sound that was like music so distant that it was\nas a thing heard in a dream.\n\n\"Perhaps I behold visions,\" he murmured. \"It may be that I shall awake.\"\n\nBut he found himself making his way through the bushes and setting his\nfeet upon the road. He must follow, he must follow. Howsoever steep the\nhill, he must climb to Bethlehem. But as he went on his way it did not\nseem steep, and he did not waver or toil as he usually did when walking.\nHe felt no weariness or ache in his limbs, and the high radiance gently\nlighted the path and dimly revealed that many white flowers he had never\nseen before seemed to have sprung up by the roadside and to wave softly\nto and fro, giving forth a fragrance so remote and faint, yet so clear,\nthat it did not seem of earth. It was perhaps part of the vision.\n\nOf the distance he climbed his thought took no cognizance. There was in\nthis vision neither distance nor time. There was only faint radiance,\nfar, strange sounds, and the breathing of air which made him feel an\necstasy of lightness as he moved. The other Zia had traveled painfully,\nhad stumbled and struck his feet against wayside stones. He seemed ten\nthousand miles, ten thousand years away. It was not he who went to\nBethlehem, led as if by some power invisible. To Bethlehem! To\nBethlehem, where went the woman whose blue robe was bordered with a glow\nof fair luminousness and whose face, like an uplifted lily, softly\nshone. It was she he followed, knowing no reason but that his soul was\ncalled.\n\nWhen he reached the little town and stood at last near the gateway of\nthe khan in which the day-long procession of wayfarers had crowded to\ntake refuge for the night, he knew that he would find no place among the\nmultitude within its walls. Too many of the great Caesar's subjects had\nbeen born in Bethlehem and had come back for their enrolment. The khan\nwas crowded to its utmost, and outside lingered many who had not been\nable to gain admission and who consulted plaintively with one another as\nto where they might find a place to sleep, and to eat the food they\ncarried with them.\n\nZia had made his way to the entrance-gate only because he knew the\ntravelers he had followed would seek shelter there, and that he might\nchance to hear of them.\n\n\nHe stood a little apart from the gate and waited. Something would tell\nhim what he must do. Almost as this thought entered his mind he heard\nvoices speaking near him. Two women were talking together, and soon he\nbegan to hear their words.\n\n\"Joseph of Nazareth and Mary his wife,\" one said. \"Both of the line of\nDavid. There was no room for them, even as there was no room for others\nnot of royal lineage. To the mangers in the cave they have gone, seeing\nthe woman had sore need of rest. She, thou knowest--\"\n\nZia heard no more. He did not ask where the cave lay. He had not needed\nto ask his way to Bethlehem. That which had led him again directed his\nfeet away from the entrance-gate of the khan, past the crowded court and\nthe long, low wall of stone within the inclosure of which the camels and\nasses browsed and slept, on at last to a pathway leading to the gray of\nrising rocks. Beneath them was the cave, he knew, though none had told\nhim so. Only a short distance, and he saw what drew him trembling\nnearer. At the open entrance, through which he could see the rough\nmangers of stone, the heaps of fodder, and the ass munching slowly in a\ncorner, the woman who wore the blue robe stood leaning wearily against\nthe heavy wooden post. And the soft light bordering her garments set her\nin a frame of faint radiance and glowed in a halo about her head.\n\n\"The light! the light!\" cried Zia in a breathless whisper. And he\ncrossed his hands upon his breast.\n\nHer husband surely could not see it. He moved soberly about, unpacking\nthe burden the ass had carried and seeming to see naught else. He heaped\nstraw in a corner with care, and threw his mantle upon it.\n\n\"Come,\" he said. \"Here thou canst rest, and I can watch by thy side. The\nangels of the Lord be with thee!\" The woman turned from the door and\nwent toward him, walking with slow steps. He gazed at her with mild,\nunillumined eyes.\n\n\"Does he not see the light!\" panted Zia. \"Does he not see the light!\"\n\nSoon he himself no longer saw it. Joseph of Nazareth came to the wooden\ndoors and drew them together, and the boy stood alone on the\nmountain-side, trembling still, and wet with the dew of the night; but\nnot weary, not hungered, not athirst or afraid, only quaking with wonder\nand joy--he, the little hunchback Zia, who had known no joy before since\nthe hour of his birth.\n\nHe sank upon the earth slowly in an exquisite peace--a peace that\nthrilled his whole being as it stole over his limbs, deepening moment by\nmoment. His head drooped softly upon a cushion of moss. As his eyelids\nfell, he saw the splendor of whiteness floating in the height of the\npurple vault above him.\n\nThe dawn was breaking and yet the stars had not faded away. This was his\nthought when his eyes first opened on a great one, greater than any\nother in the sky, and of so pure a brilliance that it seemed as if even\nthe sun would not be bright enough to put it out. It hung high in the\npaling blue, high as the white radiance; and as he lay and gazed, he\nthought it surely moved. What new star was it that in that one night had\nbeen born? He had watched the stars through so many desolate hours that\nhe knew each great one as a friend, and this one he had never seen\nbefore.\n\nThe morning was cold, and his clothes were wet with dew, but he felt no\nchill. He remembered; yes, he remembered. If he had lived in a vision\nthe day before, he was surely living in one yet. The Zia who had been\nstarved and beaten and driven out naked into the world, who had clutched\nhis thin breast and sobbed, writhing upon the earth, where was he? He\nlooked down upon his hands and saw the cracked and scaling palms, and it\nwas as though they were not. He thrust back the covering from his chest\nand saw the spots there. But there were no lepers, there were no\nhunchbacks; there were only Zia and the light. He knelt and turned\nhimself toward the cave and prayed, and as he so knelt and prayed the\nman Joseph rolled open the heavy wooden door.\n\nThen Zia, still kneeling, beat himself softly upon the breast and prayed\nagain, not as before to Jehovah, but to that which he beheld.\n\nThe light was there, fair, radiant, wonderful. The cave was bathed in\nit. The woman in the blue robe sat upon the straw, and in her arms she\nheld a new-born child. Zia touched his forehead to the earth again,\nagain, again, unknowing that he did so. The child was the light itself!\n\nHe must rise and draw near. That which had drawn him up the mountainside\ndrew him again. The child was the light itself! As he crept near the\ncave's entrance, the woman's eyes rested upon him soft and wonderful.\n\nShe spoke to him--she spoke!\n\n\"Be not afraid,\" she said. \"Draw nigh and behold!\"\n\nHer voice was not as the voice of other women; it was like her eyes, his\nbody, through his blood, through every limb and fleshy atom of him, he\nfelt it steal--new life, warming, thrilling, wakening in his veins new\nlife! As he felt it, he knelt quaking with rapture even as he had stood\nthe night before gazing at the light. The new-born hand lay still.\n\nHe did not know how long he knelt. He did not know that the woman leaned\ntoward him, scarce drawing breath, her wondrous eyes resting upon him as\nif she waited for a sign. Even as she so gazed she beheld it, and spoke,\nwhispering as in awed prayer:\n\n\"Go forth and cleanse thy flesh in running water,\" she said. \"Go forth.\"\n\nHe moved, he rose, he stood upright--the hunchback Zia who had never\nstood upright before! His body was straight, his limbs were strong. He\nlooked upon his hands, and there was no blemish or spot to be seen!\n\n\"I am made whole!\" he cried in ecstasy so wild that his boy's voice rang\nand echoed in the cave's hollowed roof. \"I am made whole!\"\n\n\"Go forth,\" she said softly. \"Go forth and give praise.\"\n\nHe turned and went into the dawning day. He stood swaying, and heard\nhimself sob forth a rapturous cry of prayer. His flesh was fresh and\npure; he stood erect and tall. He was as others whom God had not cursed.\nThe light! the light! He stretched forth his arms to the morning sky.\n\nSome shepherds roughly clothed in the skins of lambs and kids were\nclimbing the hill toward the cave. They carried their crooks, and they\ntalked eagerly as though in wonderment at some strange thing which had\nbefallen them, looking up at the heavens, and one pointed with his\ncrook.\n\n\"Surely it draws nearer, the star!\" he said. \"Look!\"\n\nAs they passed a thicket where a brook flowed through the trees a fair\nboy came forth, cleansed, fresh, and radiant as if he had but just\nbathed in its clear waters. It was the boy Zia.\n\n\"Who is this one?\" said the oldest shepherd.\n\n\"How beautiful he is! How the light shines on him! He looks like a king's\nson.\"\n\nAnd as they passed, they made obeisance to him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
