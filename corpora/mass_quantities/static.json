    "body": "Water slogged heavily against the hull of the Niger packet _Lagarto_.\nClose at hand the jungle, waving ghostly arms in the moonlight, seemed\nto be giving a horrid imitation of great beasts floundering and\nslobbering at the edge of the river. On the deck of the _Lagarto_\nlounged Captain Angus Todd, who in spite of his name, was ending his far\njourneying and hard-driving life as the master of a clumsy freight boat.\nHe was tall, and lean, with that Scotch type of leanness which can best\nbe understood by pronouncing the name \u201cSandy\u201d with the \u201ca\u201d broad. He\nsmoked a foul pipe and occasionally spat into the greasy water below.\n\n\u201cYou mind, Mac,\u201d he said finally, tapping the dead ash from his pipe on\nthe rail. \u201cYou mind that I\u2019m growing a bit older these days, and the\nmore I think on it, the more I feel that Africa\u2019s no the place for any\nwhite man.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d came the answer, evidently emanating from a black bundle slumped\nin a steamer chair under the awning. \u201cI\u2019m thinking I\u2019ve heard that idea\nexpressed before--several times in fact. Maybe you\u2019re right, but you\ncan\u2019t deny that the English make big money here, buying palm oil and\nrubber for about nothing. And selling geegaws, trade gin and trade cloth\nfor ten times their value--even though the natives are getting wise to\ntraders\u2019 tricks--converting the heathen and making the nigger women wear\ncalico dresses. You\u2019ll admit that\u2019s an accomplishment.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye, but the price, man. Think on that a bit.\u201d The captain paused and\nwatched a native canoe with its lonely paddler drift softly past the\nship and disappear in the moon glow. Then he resumed. \u201cTell me, Mac, how\nmany men has your company sent out here in the last ten years? I hate to\nthink--twenty, anyway. Great, strappin\u2019 youngsters, most of them, pink\nand white and blond, brought up to play cricket and football. It fair\nmakes my heart bleed to think how they came out for the bonus--to make\nenough to marry, perhaps, or to lift the mortgage. And they usually got\nthe bonus, too, but have you noted them at the end of their three years.\nSallow and racked with fever. Wishing to Heaven they were dead, many of\nthem, and soaked with booze, a lot. Most of them spent that bonus and a\ngreat deal more keeping out of the grave after they went home. I\u2019m glad\nthe company\u2019s making you agent at Maraban at last, Mac.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Scots that keep the Empire running,\u201d grunted Thomas\nMacAllister, the man in the deck chair. \u201cAnd me at Maraban as kernel\nclerk for more years than I care to think on, doing my work and that of\nthe agent, mostly, and not complainin\u2019 overmuch, mind you. Then, when\nthe agent blew up, shipping him down river and holding things together\nuntil they sent up another Boy from Home to take his place.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye, I understand, and the home office scratching its head and\nwondering what is the matter at Maraban,\u201d replied the captain. \u201cGosh,\nthey don\u2019t know what this stinkin\u2019 hole is. \u2018The White Man\u2019s Graveyard,\u2019\n\u2019tis called, but that\u2019s merely a name outside. At least those fellows in\nthe Scriptures got out of the fiery furnace after a bit. We never do. So\nit was Timmy Smith you took out this time?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes--and Timmy was a nice chap when he first came. Manicured his\nfingers--dressed for dinner and all of that. Shaved every day, Heaven\nforbid. Well, you saw him last week. Bleary and smeared, in a bath towel\nand singlet, with a native huzzy for a wife, and a sick mind. After two\nyears and a month. Went completely off his nut the day after you were at\nMaraban. I had to take him out to Forcados. Headquarters down there gave\nup in despair and appointed me in his place. Todd,\u201d the new agent\ncontinued savagely, puffing rapidly at his cigarette, which winked\nbrightly in the shadows, \u201cit\u2019s only leather bellies like you and me who\nshould be sent up to the lonely stations where all the people one sees\nare negroes. I tell you, they\u2019ve got to come to it. I never knew but one\nyoungster who came through decently. That was Charles Markley. \u2019Member\nhim?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, rather,\u201d chuckled the captain. \u201cI was just reading in the _Times_\nabout his success as a radio wizard back home. Seems he\u2019s succeeded in\neliminating static, or something.\u201d He kicked another deck chair into\nbeing and sat down. \u201cDo you remember when he first came out, Mac? I\nbrought him up river while he was nursing the worst grouch I ever saw.\n\n\u201cIt was such a night as this, all silver and black, I recall, when I\ntook him up to your hell\u2019s hole at Maraban. The jungle was sloshing and\nsquawling over there, and Markley sitting about where you are, staring\nat the moon with hard eyes, set in a face sour as spoiled milk. He was\nrather handsome, tall and long-legged as the best of the English are,\nand I liked him.\n\n\u201cI came up with an idea of giving him some friendly advice, like I do\nall your slaves, MacAllister, though a fine lot of good it does. Well,\nafter we\u2019d started a conversation, or rather, after I had made some sort\nof attempt at it, I said: \u2018Mr. Markley, you want to be verra careful\nabout the amount of whisky you drink in this climate. It\u2019s deadly.\u2019\n\n\u201cMaybe that wasn\u2019t very tactful, but how can you be tactful with an\novergrown, sulky boy. Anyway, he turned round with a snap and says: \u2018Mr.\nTodd,\u2019 says he, \u2018I intend to make a big dent in the liquor supply of\nNigeria inside of the next three years.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhich gave me a sort of shock, for most of the boys come out maundering\nof high ideals, clean living and Sir Galahad morality--when they first\narrive, that is.\n\n\u201c\u2018And you must be careful about mixing up wi\u2019 the native girls, at all,\nat all,\u2019 I went on. \u2018You\u2019ll be thinking I\u2019m insulting you now, but men\nwill do strange things when they\u2019re lonely, and it always leads to\ntrouble.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019m sorry to disappoint, Mr. Todd,\u2019 he snaps, \u2018but that\u2019s just what I\nwant to inquire into immediately. If you should happen to know of any\nreasonably clean, good-looking negro girl of not over seventeen, I wish\nyou\u2019d buy her for me, or whatever their beastly custom is here, and send\nher over to Maraban as soon as you can. I\u2019d greatly appreciate it, and\npay well.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou can imagine that shut me up right quickly and I left Mr. Markley to\nhis own sour thoughts, whatever they were.\n\n\u201cThe _Lagarto_ tied up at the oil wharf at Maraban next morning, and he\ngot ashore, dressed in an old pair of khaki breeches, a sleeveless\njersey and a pair of tennis shoes. He looked a sight, and I half\nexpected the sun to shrivel him up before my eyes. His baggage consisted\nmostly of two huge boxes which he grudgingly admitted contained radio\napparatus, a few books, among which I saw one named \u2018Studies in\nPessimism\u2019 by some German author--a few others, equally dismal, and ten\ncases of Scotch whisky. I suppose you discovered this soon enough, but\nit fair made me stagger when I thought that it was over and above the\nwhisky already at the station. He said good-by decently, and I left him\nstanding there, thinking black thoughts and batting at the flies which\nbuzzed around his head.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd a fine time I had of it the next few months,\u201d grunted MacAllister.\n\u201cThe kid almost pestered me to death trying to discover new short cuts\nto hell. He started drinking like a fish immediately upon his\narrival--cocktails, highballs, rickeys--he had a book of recipes for\nabout two hundred different drinks, and went through it methodically,\nmixing his own and swilling \u2019em down in a way which no good\nPresbyterian--and I am one, even in this hole --could tolerate.\n\n\u201c\u2018Mr. MacAllister,\u2019 he would say. \u2018Let\u2019s have a drink,\u2019 and if I\naccepted, he would say \u2018MacAllister, let\u2019s have another,\u2019 and after that\nit was \u2018Mac, another won\u2019t hurt us.\u2019\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019d continued that way the station would have been a total loss, so\nI had finally to refuse to drink with him. He didn\u2019t appreciate my point\nof view at all.\n\n\u201cHe raided the medicine cabinet and experimented with the little opium I\nhad there, the result being that he was violently ill for some time. The\nwhole thing was laughable, if he hadn\u2019t been so damned serious about it,\nor if he had been content to quit the foolishness after a while. It\u2019s\nbad enough, captain, to see a man disintegrate little by little under\nthe influence of the heat and stink, but cripes, it\u2019s positively\nindecent to see one conscientiously trying to kill himself.\n\n\u201cHe kept everlastingly at me to find him a girl, but right there I\nbalked. It was so cold-blooded and morbid. \u2018But I tell you, old thing,\u2019\nhe\u2019d beam at me, \u2018really a nigger girl is part of the white man\u2019s\nburthen, if one believes the plays and novels published nowadays. It\u2019s\nquite _de rigueur_, donchaknow,\u2019 he would drawl.\n\n\u201cJust as luck would have it, the girl did turn up, a few weeks later.\nShe was black as ebony, and graceful as the devil\u2019s wife, if he has one.\nThe tale she told was that she was a cousin of one of the house boys,\nand that her family had died of sleeping sickness, or something, so that\nshe had to come to live with her last relative. Well, you can guess what\nhappened after that. Markley simply appropriated her. Not, I sincerely\nbelieve, because he particularly wanted her, but because she fitted into\nsome gloomy picture of his final demise which he had built up. \u2018Mac, my\nboy,\u2019 he grinned at me after he had moved her into the bungalow, over my\nalmost tearful protests. \u2018She is rather chic, you know. Wouldn\u2019t she\nmake a sensation in London with that figure and that hide.\u2019 I went out\nand cursed the day both of us were born, and I\u2019m not usually a\nblasphemous man, Todd.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must have been about a month after he got the girl that I saw\nMarkley for the second time,\u201d the captain took up the tale. \u201cI had some\nstuff for the station and tied up at the wharf. Things looked about as\nusual. A few natives with loaded canoes, a few Kroo boys busy tidying\nthe compound. In fact I began to think that Markley had got over his fit\nuntil I reached the bungalow veranda. He was sitting there, with his\nbare feet sticking over the rail. It startled me somewhat. Apparently,\nhe had accomplished in two months what even the most soft-willed white\nman seldom reaches in years. I\u2019ll admit I admired his determination.\n\n\u201cHe was dressed in a singlet, while about his waist was a bath towel,\nwhich automatically defined his state of disintegration. He was in the\nbath-towel stage, the next step being for him to \u2018go native\u2019 and spend\nthe rest of his days rotting in some nigger village, ashamed to let\nwhite men see him.\n\n\u201c\u2018Greetings, cap\u2019n,\u2019 he called. \u2018Come up and refresh yourself. Ruth,\u2019 he\nshouted to some one inside, \u2018bring a glass for a gentleman, a clean one.\nPardon me,\u2019 he added, turning back to me, \u2018I was referring to the glass,\nnot the gentleman, though I suppose it would be equally appropriate.\u2019\nDuring the pause which followed I tried to imagine who this \u2018Ruth\u2019 might\nbe. A white woman could have come up the river, but it was very doubtful\nthat it would have happened without my knowing of it. Then Ruth came out\nof the bungalow. MacAllister, I\u2019ll agree with you. She was\nremarkable--lithe and clean-cut, with some forgotten Arab strain, I\nsuspect. And she wasn\u2019t wearing a stitch of clothes.\u201d\n\nFrom his chair, MacAllister snorted in disgust.\n\n\u201c\u2018Lemme introdush you,\u2019 Markley grinned, shambling to his feet and\ngrasping her shoulder to steady himself. \u2018Ruth meet cap\u2019n, cap\u2019n meet\nRuth\u2019--all that sort of thing. \u2018You may,\u2019 he continued owlishly, \u2018marvel\nat her name. I have bestowed the historic appellation because the\noriginal Ruth was also a gleaner. I have insisted on the d\u00e9collet\u00e9 for\ntwo reasons, first because, dreshed that way, it will be impossible for\nher to carry off her gleanings when she leaves the bungalow. As a result\nof this precaution I have lost none of the silver plate or gilded\nphotograph albums. Second, because it\u2019s so awful hot that I feel sorry\nfor any one who has to wear clothes.\u2019 He unwound the bath towel, swabbed\nhis face, neck and chest and reshipped it around his waist. Then he sank\nback into his chair and pushed the warm whisky and soda toward me.\n\n\u201cI suppose I should have got his receipts for the shipment and left\nimmediately, for he was certainly beyond the pale of tolerance, but the\nlad was so plainly lonely and miserable that I sat sipping the whisky,\nwhich was really good, and listening to the tale, which, between periods\nof weeping, he unfolded. I suppose you\u2019ve heard it all before, haven\u2019t\nyou, Mac?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was tight as a clam with me when it came to family history,\u201d replied\nMacAllister. \u201cBesides we didn\u2019t talk any more than necessary after he\ntook that woman in.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe came from Devonshire, he said,\u201d the captain resumed. \u201cAttended\nOxford and some technical college----\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, he used to rub it in a little about being an Oxford man, I\nremember, after he learned I had attended King\u2019s College back in the\ndark ages,\u201d growled MacAllister.\n\n\u201cHe said there had always been plenty of money,\u201d Todd resumed. \u201cHis\nfather paid all bills without much complaint. Some difficulty with his\neyes kept him out of the war, so that he finished his courses,\nspecializing in mechanics and electricity. Naturally he became\nfascinated with the radio. That was back in 1919, you remember, when the\nwhole thing was in its infancy, and commercial broadcasting was hardly\nthought of. A lot of experimenting was being done, however, and Markley\nhit upon a great idea--to make a radio receiving amplifier loud enough\nto fill great auditoriums and provide entertainment for vast\ncongregations. The only trouble was that when music or voices were\namplified so many times, the static was amplified along with it,\nresulting in intense vibrations and awful screeches and yells, so that\nthe program itself would be inaudible. There was also some danger, he\ndeclared, if the amplification was great enough, of shaking down the\nceiling of the auditorium itself. The boy claimed he had overcome this\ndifficulty.\n\n\u201c\u2018Captain,\u2019 he blurted, patting my shoulder tenderly, \u2018cap\u2019n, you shee\nbefore you the one and only, triple-guaranteed eliminator of static in\nthis little world. Gaze upon him well, cap\u2019n. The odds are running three\nto one it will be your last chance.\u2019\n\n\u201cWas he lying or not, Mac?\u201d\n\n\u201cI almost wish he had been,\u201d growled the new agent. \u201cBut he was telling\nyou strict truth. Radio was the only thing he was interested in, even at\nMaraban. He dug his apparatus out of the packing cases the week he\narrived, and rigged it up in a deserted sheet iron shack. There he\u2019d\nsit, tinkering with it and drinking--straight whisky, too--until almost\nmorning, to the great awe of the niggers and the total abolishment of\nsleep at the station. A few broadcasting stations were opening up over\nthe world, especially in America. You remember that was the summer every\none went crazy over the things. His set was big enough to get them all,\ntoo. With the amplifiers cut in, the music would blare through the whole\ncompound at night, until I threatened to sleep in the jungle. When he\ntuned in on a speech or a bedtime story--he preferred those--the voice\nsounded like that of a giant, with ten times the volume of ordinary\ntones, but clearer and more free from noise than the best phonograph. It\nfair had the natives hypnotized. They used to take little offerings to\nthe door of the shanty to appease the wrath of the juju inside. \u2018Big\nmouf\u2019 they termed him.\n\n\u201cThe only difficulty, as Markley explained to me once, in a moment of\nfriendliness, was that he had to keep eternally balancing the static out\nof it with special condensers. I remember one morning he went to sleep\nover the thing. Pandemonium broke loose. The little shack seemed almost\nto bounce off the ground as the set went out of balance and the static\nseeped in. The row was deafening. I ran down and jerked all the switches\nI could find to shut it off, but Markley slept through it all, under the\nradio table. I had an awful temptation to smash the thing, Todd. Only\nthe fact that I am a good Presbyterian saved me. Lucky it did.\u201d\n\nThe captain chuckled, refueled his pipe and continued: \u201cThe boy told me\nthings began to look pretty bad in England. No one wanted to finance his\ninventions, least of all his father, who decided his son wasn\u2019t as\nbright as he had hoped. What broadcasting was being done was purely\nexperimental, so that there seemed little chance of financial success\nfrom his idea.\n\n\u201cThe upshot was that his father promised to cut off his allowance if he\ndidn\u2019t go to work--all the big electrical corporations refused to meddle\nwith the thing, and, as a last straw, the girl in the case--oh, yes,\nthere was one--sided with his father.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s about all, except that since no one had confidence in him--since\nhis sweetheart didn\u2019t love him for himself alone--he got very tearful at\nthis point--he decided to come to darkest Africa and romantically go to\nhell in a hurry, principally, of course, so that the girl would realize\nher mistake too late. He got a position with the African Produce\nAssociation--was made an agent, in fact, due perhaps to father\u2019s\ninfluence, and came out prepared to cut all the corners.\n\n\u201c\u2018You see,\u2019 he explained, looking at me owlishly. \u2018I\u2019d read so much\nabout what the tropics do to a man--how unless he\u2019s made of steel they\nwill wreck him within a year or so, no matter how he fights. Well, I\njust thought it would be interesting to cut out the preliminaries. Go\nthe whole route, as you might say, at once, and have it over with.\u2019\n\n\u201cWith that he lapsed from tears into slumber and I departed, feeling a\nwee bit old and helpless--wishing there were some way of shaking him out\nof his romantic notions and back into reality. But what can a man do\nwhen a boy gets it into his head to kill himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I thought the same thing during the next few months,\u201d groaned\nMacAllister. \u201cThings went from bad to worse. Oh, the station went along\nfairly well, with everything running smoothly and the oil coming in\nregularly. Markley, in the mornings before he had a chance to get too\nsoused, did what little work there was for him to do, well enough, but\nthe rest of the time he would sit on the veranda, swilling liquor in a\nmanner I never thought possible. What a constitution he must have had! I\ncould have sworn he hated the stuff, but was drinking it on some kind of\nbet with himself. In a way things got as bad as they did later when\nTimmy Smith came, and yet again they didn\u2019t. Markley wouldn\u2019t allow the\nboys to loaf. He made them keep the bungalow and compound reasonably\nclean, and he kept all his socks under lock and key because he had read\nsomewhere that the native cooks particularly prize them as coffee\nstrainers. After that woman came--her native name was Eta something or\nother--he made her keep his quarters spick and span clean, and I\u2019ll have\nto admit she did it well. But he drank day and night. It got so that he\nwas just one jump ahead of D. T.\u2019s, and I can\u2019t help feeling that he was\nbetting with himself just how long it would take him to achieve them.\n\n\u201cHis only diversion was the radio. He never tired of it. Used to take\nEta down to the shack and amuse himself trying to explain the workings\nof the set to her in a mixture of pidgin and mission English.\n\n\u201cOne day he called in all the natives about the place, including a\nnumber of canoemen from upriver, and explained that the shack concealed\nthe white man\u2019s God, whose voice they heard. No harm, he declared, could\ncome to those under the protection thereof. Blasphemy it was, and myself\na good Presbyterian. I remember Markley was especially drunk that day.\nHis eyes were burning and his hands shook. Hanging onto a chair with one\nhand, gesticulating wildly with the other, he made a speech to the\nnatives in such an amazing mixture of English, Latin and pidgin as must\nhave rivaled the gibberish of their own witch doctors.\n\n\u201cAbout a week after that a runner from King Tolo appeared at the station\nwith a message. Now Tolo, as you know, is an imperialist with the idea\nthat he owns a large per cent of the Niger. He has no more love for the\nEnglish than they have for him, but he just manages to keep inside the\ndeadline. The message was written by some mission-bred negro who had\ndrawn it up in what he conceived to be strictly legal form, with such a\nsprinkling of \u201chereinbefores\u201d and \u201cwhereas\u2019s\u201d as to make the muggy paper\nalmost unintelligible. After we had deciphered it, it became apparent\nthat King Tolo was greatly hurt and grieved--that one Eta, a cousin of\nthe king--now residing with the agent at Maraban, one Charles\nMarkley--had been married without the knowledge or consent of the\naforesaid Tolo, or worse yet, that she had never been married. Now,\ntherefore, the said Tolo demanded as his rightful marriage portion, the\nfollowing, to wit: A list which included, among other impossible things,\na case of whisky and two rifles.\n\n\u201cMarkley laughed for the first time since he had been in Maraban when he\ngot the gist of it, and his yellow, dulled eyes seemed to brighten a\nlittle. It was his first show of human feelings in about eight months.\nHe immediately translated the message to Eta, getting quite appreciative\nover the fact that the thirty-second cousin of King Tolo was worth two\nMauser rifles.\n\n\u201c\u2018How does it happen you never mentioned your high connections before,\nRuth,\u2019 he demanded.\n\n\u201c\u2018No savvy, boss,\u2019 she replied, uncomfortably. \u2018You no ask me,\nmebbe-so.\u2019\n\n\u201cAfter the messenger had departed, first being duly kicked by\nmyself--Markley was too shaky--things began to happen. Trade slackened\nabruptly. A houseboy was found badly cut up just outside the compound\nand several of the Kroo boys stole a canoe and deserted downriver.\n\n\u201cTo cap the climax Markley called me into his room and, pointing to an\nentirely imaginary black panther cat which he swore was squatting on his\nbed, asked me if I wanted to shoot it, or tame it.\n\n\u201cIt was a week later, I think, that another messenger arrived. This time\nhe came, not directly from Tolo, but from the chief witch doctor of the\nrealm, one Buhu, I gathered, who had heard of the magic of the\ngod-who-talks.\n\n\u201cThe messenger sat circumspectly at a distance and explained his errand.\nBuhu, it seemed, had conceived some very potent ideas as to the powers\nof Markley\u2019s magic. Now, in effect, he proposed a sort of bout between\nthem.\n\n\u201cAs the messenger explained:\n\n\u201c\u2018Chief Tolo he say mak\u2019 so-so little-bit palaver, Buhu and Boss Markley\nupriver. Take \u2019long juju big mouf, mebbe so. Mebbe so he not come talk\njuju belong along Buhu, trade not come along company house. Mebbe so he\ncome, Tolo not ask dash for Eta. Palaver set.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhich, freely translated, meant that Buhu was becoming anxious about\nthe presence of bigger gods than his own on the Niger, and had persuaded\nTolo to put the screws on Markley so that he could get a look-see at\nthis strange spirit. If we came, Tolo would agree to let bygones be\nbygones, withdraw his request for the marriage price of his\nthirty-second cousin and allow trade to return to the compound. If not,\nthings would be rather dull at Maraban in the future. Also I rather\nsuspected that Buhu was planning a coup of some kind to get the loud\nmouf juju into his possession, for there is no more jealous person in\nthe world than a witch doctor when he thinks some one is stealing his\nthunder. I suppose they live so close to the edge of discovery that they\nbecome jumpy.\n\n\u201cMarkley had listened to the message from his usual seat on the veranda,\nleaning forward and trying to focus his eyes on the messenger. I\nexpected him to roundly curse the black, and slump back in his chair. In\nthat world of whisky haze in which he was living those days, nothing\nseemed to matter very much. Instead, he wobbled to his feet and replied\nloudly:\n\n\u201c\u2018Go speak your so-so witch doctor Buhu. Tell him Big Boss Markley come,\nmebbe so two days. Juju big mouf he come, too, mebbe so, mebbe not. He\nbig juju fo\u2019 sure. Eta come \u2019long big boss. By an\u2019 by, my juju he win,\nEta stay along me. By an\u2019 by, Buhu win, Tolo take Eta and have dash,\ntoo. Palaver set.\u2019\n\n\u201cAs soon as the messenger had departed Markley set about preparations\nfor the trip. In his half-delirious mind, it became a huge joke, reality\nbeing all mixed up with the whisky phantoms which peopled his brain. He\nwouldn\u2019t listen when I told him that there was probably danger in the\nundertaking, but proceeded to pack all the radio apparatus in a big\ncase. Then calling Eta, he produced a bright crimson shawl, a pair of\ndancing pumps of the same color and a brilliant bandanna, which he had\nordered from Forcados on the last boat, and presented them to her,\ndeclaring that she must be decently dressed when visiting a cousin.\nAfter that he took a long drink and declared himself ready to start.\n\n\u201cThat was a queer trip. I had wanted to stay at the station, but Markley\nwouldn\u2019t hear of it. Said there was no danger at Maraban--that the big\nshow would come at Mobungo, one of Chief Tolo\u2019s villages, and he might\nneed me there. We locked the bungalow and store, placed things in charge\nof the most trusted negroes--a poor policy, but the best I could do, and\nstarted upriver in the station\u2019s motor launch.\n\n\u201cI steered. Markley sat in the middle where he watched the engine. Eta\nsat near the bow, staring steadily upriver. She was a weird creature,\nthat girl. Light on her feet as a shadow and about as quick. She never\nsaid a word to anybody except Markley, though even with him she seemed\nto hold aloof. She was always obedient and met all of his sometimes\neccentric demands upon her without complaint, but her sloe-black eyes,\nslanting here and there in an almost Oriental fashion, sometimes gave me\nthe creeps.\n\n\u201cStrangely enough, Markley brought only a quart of whisky with him, and\nused that very sparingly. \u2018Dickie,\u2019 he explained to me, \u2018I fear I must\npass up the nectar for a time. But there\u2019s plenty of it back at the\nstation, or will be if those damned negroes don\u2019t run off with it. When\nwe get back, I\u2019ll celebrate. Maybe you\u2019ll condescend to take a few,\ntoo.\u2019 That\u2019s the way he rambled on, but I could see a new sparkle in his\nbloodshot eyes, and began to wonder if maybe there wasn\u2019t something in\nhim besides his vicious habits after all. I suppose he was the type who\nlives on excitement, though why he came to Africa to find it I never\ncould understand.\n\n\u201cWe reached Mobungo after a two-day run. The usual gaping crowd met us,\nbut before we were ashore, Tolo himself, with a military escort, plowed\nthrough the jam and greeted us. Have you ever seen Tolo, captain?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot since he was the prince charming of the Niger, years ago,\u201d Todd\nchuckled in the darkness.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s still about the same. Wears flowers in his wool and all that, but\nhe\u2019s getting older and fatter, and dreaming of empire instead of fair\nwomen. He\u2019ll get into serious trouble sometime soon. However he treated\nus civilly enough, giving us a hut in which to clean up a bit.\n\n\u201cThat evening we met him at the imperial palace, such as it was, for an\naudience. The room was furnished in Afro-American style, with a\nphonograph, a player piano and a nickel and white barber chair serving\nas a throne. Tolo was there, tricked out in his royal robes. Beside him\nsquatted Buhu. The latter wasn\u2019t all that I expected--just a lean,\nhungry-looking, rather young and rather shiny individual who did nothing\nbut teeter back and forth on his toes and scowl at us.\n\n\u201cThe meeting began in one of those duels of silence--the man who speaks\nfirst being considered the weaker character--but Markley wasn\u2019t up to\nthe strain of it and almost immediately broke silence by demanding why\nthe devil Tolo had sent him a note like that.\n\n\u201cThe old chap hemmed and hawed, but finally explained that there was no\nthreat implied, merely a friendly contest between rival demons.\n\n\u201cMarkley was willing to let it go at that, so that without much further\nparleying, details were arranged for the exhibition next morning, and we\nturned in for the night, leaving the niggers dancing and prancing in\nsome kind of a ceremonial outside the hut.\n\n\u201c\u2018Mark,\u2019 I asked, as we were undressing in the dark. \u2018You noticed that\nphonograph in the throne room. How do you expect to make much of an\nimpression when they\u2019re acquainted with such things.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Sound and fury, sound and fury, me lad,\u2019 he chuckled. \u2018I\u2019m not\nexpecting to impress the king of Buhu, much. But one must always\nconsider the mob. Whatever Buhu is up to, he\u2019s out to impress the\nrabble--and so are we. Damn, I wish I had a drink.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe next morning we were escorted to the sacred cavern where Buhu did\nhis tricks. It was large, about one hundred feet deep, with a wide,\nhigh-arching mouth and appeared to have been caused by erosion at some\ntime when the river bed lay in front of it.\n\n\u201cHere Buhu kept his charms and talismans, most of them in a stinking\nheap in one corner. There were bones, both human and animal, strange\nherbs, and charms, of all varieties. The air was rank with\nunidentifiable stinks. A fire was kept burning at the entrance, with the\nresult that the place was full of smoke most of the time, which,\nwhirling and eddying inside, caused a really ghostly effect.\n\n\u201cAt the invitation of the morose witch doctor Markley here set up the\nmouthpiece of big mouf, the intruder. We rigged some lights from a\nstorage battery and soon had everything in readiness. At the magician\u2019s\ncommand the whole population of the village--about three hundred\npersons--shuffled hesitatingly into the cavern.\n\n\u201cPersonally I thought Buhu\u2019s show was pretty poor stuff. It wouldn\u2019t\neven have made a hit on the variety stage at home. There were a few\nparlor magic tricks, a clever attempt at group hypnotism which succeeded\nfairly well with the natives, but left Markley and myself untouched, and\na final tableau where Buhu seemed to vanish in a cloud of red smoke,\nimmediately re\u00ebntering the cavern through the audience. That was really\ndeserving of applause, but didn\u2019t impress the crowd greatly. Perhaps the\ntrick had grown stale by repetition. It was the climax of the show and\nBuhu signed for us to begin.\n\n\u201cMarkley had placed the apparatus under a dim red light, and with the\ntrue showman\u2019s instinct had posed Eta, in her crimson shawl and shoes,\nbeside it. After making a somewhat wobbly salaam to the machinery he\nimmediately got busy, tuning in on a London station with very little\namplification, so that just a whisper of sound filled the cave. It was\nan organ recital. The natives shivered and shifted their positions. As\nhe began cutting in amplification the notes swelled and seemed almost to\nsolidify, the sounds shuddering in the great cave like the wings of an\nimprisoned bird.\n\n\u201cEven I, who had become well acquainted with the possibilities of the\nthing, felt the spell. Every note was perfect.\n\n\u201cOver the dials, Markley, dressed in a dark-green robe with a cowl,\nwhich he had concocted from some trade cloth for this occasion, seemed\ntruly a priest making his invocations.\n\n\u201cAs the last notes of the program died away the natives broke into\nexclamations of wonder, admiration and awe. Their love of music was\naroused, and it was easy to see that they had forgotten Buhu and his\nsorceries.\n\n\u201cWaiting until the excitement had abated somewhat Markley picked up\nanother station, this time at New York. Some one was making an\naddress--strangely enough--upon the wonders of radio, the miraculous\nadvancement it had made in the last year, and so on.\n\n\u201cI had noticed sometime before that Eta had left her place beside the\ncabinet. Now I saw her in earnest converse with Buhu, across the cave.\nIt gave me quite a shock and I watched closely. Evidently the witchman\nwas in the dumps. His head sagged. His hands quivered. He knew when he\nwas beaten. But Eta actually was shaking his holiness by the shoulder. I\ncould see her lips moving in a vehement exhortation of some kind,\nalthough not a word of it could be heard above the voice of the orator.\n\n\u201c\u2018A new era for the world has begun,\u2019 thundered the voice to the\nuncomprehending natives. \u2018Men are being drawn closer together by this\nnew marvel, and will become one great brotherhood. If only there can be\nfound some way to eliminate static our problem will be solved, and, I\nwish to add, that great monetary rewards now are available to the man\nwho will step forward to eliminate this great obstruction to radio\ncommunication.\u2019\n\n\u201cI glanced at Markley. He was listening, spellbound, forgetful of\neverything that was transpiring. I glanced back at Eta. She had risen\nand was moving slowly toward us. Buhu was whispering vehemently to\nseveral of the natives. As I watched, Eta approached, and, without\nwarning, placed her glossy back tight against the loudspeaker\u2019s mouth.\nThe spell was broken. The orator\u2019s voice died to a murmur, completely\nblocked by the obstruction.\n\n\u201cSuddenly Eta\u2019s voice rang out, speaking in purest native dialect, which\nI understood fairly well, but which Markley had never cared to learn.\n\n\u201c\u2018Oh, my people,\u2019 she cried, lifting her arms high. \u2018This man is an\nimpostor. He is not the servant of this great voice.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018What the hell, Ruth,\u2019 broke in Markley sharply, \u2018get out of the way.\nYou\u2019re spoiling the show.\u2019 He half rose to push her away, but a huge\nblack who had slipped behind him unnoticed in the excitement, gripped\nhis shoulders and held him to his seat. At the same moment I felt the\nwarning pressure of a knife point on my neck.\n\n\u201c\u2018Oh, my people,\u2019 continued Eta, unperturbed, \u2018ye know that I am the\nsister of Buhu, master of life and death, and that I was sent by my\nbrother to spy upon this wicked foreigner. You know that I have suffered\ngreatly at his hands. But Eta, the tigress, is patient. Know, all ye,\nthat I have learned that this man is not the priest of the voice. He is\na great magician who holds the god in his power, even as the wicked\nsnake which charms the singing bird. Know also that I have discovered by\nwatching closely how to break the spell and release the voice from its\nprison. It has promised me to make the people of Tolo the greatest on\nthe river. Away with the white witch doctor,\u2019 she shrieked. \u2018I will be\nits priestess.\u2019\n\n\u201cI realized that Eta must have been using her eyes closely during the\nlast months. She knew how to operate Markley\u2019s radio and this whole\naffair was a plot to take it from us.\n\n\u201c\u2018Kill the white men,\u2019 Eta screamed in a frenzy. \u2018Kill, kill----\u2019 But\nMarkley had at last caught the meaning of her harangue, and with a roar,\nshook himself free from his captor and leaped at the girl. But his\ncoordinations were shaky from his whisky swilling and he fell an easy\nvictim to the dozen or so warriors who sprang forward. He went down,\nsenseless from the blow of a club, lying where he fell, while Eta,\ntearing his green robe from him, clothed herself in it and took up her\nposition behind the dials. I suppose I should have gone to his rescue,\nbut how could I, with a black devil gripping my neck with one hand and\nholding a knife as long as my arm in the other.\n\n\u201cThe orator in the loudspeaker continued his talk uninterruptedly,\ntelling of the great things which might occur in the world due to\nradio\u2019s magic--but, suddenly, his voice was broken by a frightful\nsquawk! My heart jumped. The set was going out of balance without\nMarkley\u2019s expert hand on the dials. Confidently Eta bent over the\ncabinet, but it seemed she had forgotten something essential, for the\nmachine let out a louder shriek, this time a sound like the scraping of\na titanic file across glass.\n\n\u201cSuddenly pandemonium broke loose. Somewhere between Africa and New York\nthere must have started a thunderstorm. Such frightful noises I had\nnever believed possible. The cave fairly rocked with them. The\nloudspeaker seemed to dance about the platform.\n\n\u201cThe black holding me let loose his grip and sprinted for the cave\nmouth. So did all the natives in fact, but unluckily, perhaps, because\nthe vibration had set up a miniature earthquake inside the cavern, great\nstones and quantities of earth began falling from the roof. I saw more\nthan one negro brained or broken as I crouched close to the wall. I had\ndragged Markley\u2019s body out of the greatest danger and leaned over him,\nwith my hands over my ears.\n\n\u201cOnly Eta stuck to her post, twisting the dials back and forth, but only\nsucceeding in making the vibration greater. It sounded as if all the\ndevils in hell were shrieking, and would yell forever. The cave filled\nwith dust. Through it I could see the girl, quiet and tense, working\ndoggedly--hopelessly. But all things have an end. As I watched in the\ndim red light, a giant boulder, detached after a repose of centuries,\ntumbled from the ceiling, crushing both Eta and the radio. A last\ndespairing scream and then all the noise ceased. Do you know, Mac, in\nspite of the fact that I had hated her, I felt damned sorry.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s about all,\u201d MacAllister concluded softly. \u201cMarkley was merely\nstunned and came round after a while. The natives had fled the village,\nso that it was an easy matter to return to the boat and start downriver.\n\n\u201cMarkley acted like another man. Whether he had realized that he could\nnow go home to a chance of success with his inventions or whether the\nshock had cleared his half-insane mind, I don\u2019t know, but he confessed\nto me shamefacedly that he had been acting like a damned fool. Said he\nhad wanted to quit the whole game long ago--that he hated the taste of\nwhisky, but his pride wouldn\u2019t let him stop halfway on the road to the\ninfernal regions.\n\n\u201cWe buried what was left of Eta in the river and Mark was rather cut up\nabout it. That, with the whisky he had been drinking so steadily brought\na reaction. He almost winked out with a case of acute alcoholism, but we\nmanaged to pull him through at Maraban. I took him downriver a few weeks\nlater, bound for home, looking like a ghost, but on the road to\nrecovery.\n\n\u201cThat ends the story, Todd. While it doesn\u2019t point a moral exactly,\nbeing the exception which maybe proves the rule, let\u2019s go down anyway\nand take a drink to all of us who fight this rotten, fascinating\nriver--and fail.\u201d",
