    "body": "As the soft tones of the morning gong sounded through the cabin Ool\nyawned and stretched. Then he grinned, remembering. This was the\nfirst morning of his honeymoon. Of course, honeymoons were even more\nout-of-date than marriage services. But Loris had wanted both and Ool\nwas willing to let her have her way.\n\nFunny to think that after all this time Loris was really his. His hand\ncaressed the form lying beside him, the flesh smooth and cold as marble.\n\nCold! He sat up suddenly, staring at the girl. The pearly lustre\nof her skin had faded to a chalky white, and he could see no sign\nof breathing. Frantically he felt for a heartbeat. There was none.\nLoris--his beautiful Loris, was dead.\n\n\n\nAs the lights glowed on the board, the young Watcher forgot discipline,\neven forgot the inter-office video. Stumbling into the captain's\noffice, he shouted,\n\n\"It's Commander Ool. He's requesting permission to land--\" he gulped,\ncame to attention, \"sir.\"\n\nThe captain was equally startled. But years of training helped him to\nkeep control.\n\n\"Wonder where he's been all this time. No report from him in weeks.\nPermission granted. And tell him to report up here at once. The Old Men\nwill want to hear about this. I wouldn't want to be in his boots.\"\n\n\"If I'd been gone this long I wouldn't have bothered to come back,\" the\nWatcher said.\n\n\"They'd have found him sooner or later. He couldn't stay up forever,\"\nthe captain said. \"Better get those signals out.\" And the young\nWatcher went back to his post, shaking his head over anyone foolish\nenough to anger the Old Men, while the captain put through a call to\nCommittee headquarters.\n\nBetween the frequent tests and long periods of questioning, Ool was\nalso wondering where he had been. Two weeks gone out of his life\nwithout the slightest glimmer of a memory about them. Two weeks of\nfloating in space. Had Loris been dead all the time? Or had she died\nwhile he lay unconscious? Had he--could he have killed her without\nknowing it?\n\nFuriously Ool tried to assemble his thoughts, to force his tired brain\nback over all that had happened, trying to find some explanation.\n\nHe could remember perfectly except for the last two weeks. The\nInvasion--which had threatened to wipe out Civilization. When, in the\nlast desperate moments, the untested Gilkite rays had been used, and\nlike an invisible screen, had held off the foe. How he alone had stood\nfor hours at the machines, after Gilk, the froglike Martian inventor\nhad run from the scene, howling with terror.\n\nThe crowds claiming him as the hero of the hour, screaming for the\nsight of him. Then the meeting with Loris--Loris of the silver hair,\nthe long slim body which gleamed like pearl, the husky voice.\n\nIt had been a struggle to get the Old Men to grant them permission to\nmate, for Loris was a Venusian and not at all the proper sort of mate\nfor a Warrior. But with the success of Gilkite, there might be no more\nneed for Warriors--so permission was granted. And now Loris was dead.\n\nOnce more Ool was summoned before the committee.\n\n\"The committee agrees,\" said the Oldest Man, \"that you could not have\nbeen responsible for the death of your mate.\"\n\n\"The Gilkite--\" Ool began.\n\n\"Only Gilk knows positively what to expect from it, and he cannot be\nfound. However, our scientists have given you every known test. And\nbelieve me, Captain, if there were the slightest suspicion in the minds\nof any one of them, the order would have been given for your immediate\ndestruction. We would take no chances on your being a carrier of death\nrays.\"\n\n\"And Loris?\"\n\n\"You will remember that the committee opposed this mating. Although\nLoris' ancestors--like those of all of us--were Terrans, the\ngenerations had adapted themselves to life on Venus. We do not know\nwhat changes have taken place; how they will be affected by situations\nwhich are normal to us.\"\n\nOol stood silent. In his own mind, that did not answer the question of\nwhat had happened to Loris, or what had gone on during the two weeks.\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" the Oldest Man went on smoothly, as if answering his\nthoughts, \"we have no way of telling what did happen. There was a flaw\nin the communications system of your ship. Shortly after you took off\nthe Security Screen went blank.\"\n\nThe prisoner felt the blood slowly rising in his face. The screen had\ngone blank, but it had been no accident.\n\n\n\nHe remembered Loris coming up behind him as he worked on the screen.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" she asked curiously.\n\n\"Sh,\" he warned. He worked a moment more, then the screen went blank.\n\n\"This is one ship that isn't going to have any Security Check for a\nwhile,\" he announced with satisfaction.\n\n\"Won't you get into trouble?\"\n\n\"Probably, but it will be worth it.\" He grinned at her appreciatively.\nLoris was wearing a robe of misty green, through which her body gleamed\nas though she stood in the midst of a soft cloud. Ool shook his head.\n\n\"Good thing I turned it off when I did. If some old Security Watcher\ncould see you now, his hardened arteries would probably break into a\nmillion pieces.\"\n\nLoris laughed huskily and stretched her arms above her head. The green\nmist settled slowly around her ankles. He could remember his vague\nsurprise that the pearly-hued flesh was not cold as she came into his\narms, but warm, quite warm--\n\nWas he imagining it, or was there a twinkle in the eye of the Oldest\nMan?\n\n\"The Old Men,\" he was saying drily, \"are not too old to have memories.\nThe destruction of a Security Check could be considered a major crime\nbut, since there is no war, the committee is willing to take into\nconsideration your excellent record as Commander of the Patrol--and the\ncircumstances. It is regrettable that we cannot tell what did happen to\nyour mate, but the committee agrees that you are not to blame. You are\nfree to go, Captain.\"\n\nOol walked out into the sunlight. He was free but Loris was dead.\n\nHe soon found that he was not alone in his grief. Messages poured in.\nWith the familiarity they always feel toward their heroes, the people\nhad made his loss their own. And when he met Tanya, the exotic Martian\ndancer, they shared his happiness.\n\nThere was no attempt this time to disconnect the Security Screen, so\nthe Watchers were able to tell exactly what happened. The two merely\nfell asleep. Ool--as he must have done before--slept for several days,\nas if he had been drugged, then awoke to find himself a widower for the\nsecond time. Nothing had happened, but Tanya was dead.\n\nThe examination to which Ool was submitted now was even more thorough\nthan the one he had undergone earlier. The results were the same. Once\nmore he was found innocent.\n\nBut if the committee absolved him, many of the people did not. Black\nlooks were thrown at him, people began to edge away from him in the\nstreets.\n\nOol did not blame them. To him, it was as simple as it was to them. Two\nwomen had mated with him; two women were dead. The fault was his.\n\nThere were plenty of places where they didn't care who you were\nor what you had done as long as you had the price of a drink. Ool\nfound them all. In them gathered the outcasts of half a dozen\nplanets--thieves, murderers, saboteurs--and in the midst of them,\nCaptain Ool, the pride of the Interplanetary Patrol, tried to drink\nhimself into oblivion.\n\nHe was well on his way one night sitting alone at his table when a girl\ncame to the door and looked in, as if searching for someone. Not the\nsort of girl you'd expect to find in a place like this; she was clean\nand healthy. Her short golden curls gleamed through the blue haze, and\nher firm-muscled young body in its short tunic was the focus of many\nbleary eyes as she threaded her way between the tables.\n\n\"Ool, I've been looking for you,\" she cried. He looked at her hazily.\n\n\"You don't want me,\" he spoke carefully, managing not to slur his\nwords. \"I'm Ool, the lady killer. I'll get you if you don't watch out.\"\nHe giggled and tipped up the bottle. It was empty so he waved the\nwaiter over.\n\n\"My capac--capacity's increasing,\" he told the girl. \"At first I\ncouldn't finish one bottle. Now I can almost finish two.\"\n\n\"Ool, listen--\" she caught at his arm.\n\nHe brushed her aside and reached for the bottle in the waiter's hand.\n\nThe girl beckoned the waiter aside, whispered to him. He shook his\nhead, then nodded as she slipped something into his hand. They came to\nthe table.\n\n\"You'd better go with the lady,\" the waiter advised, but Ool ignored\nhim and took another drink. The waiter lifted him to his feet. Through\nthe thickening fog Ool saw the man's fist go back.\n\nThen came the oblivion he wanted.\n\n\n\nHe awoke in what seemed to be a laboratory. It seemed familiar. So did\nthe voices he heard, both talking at once. They broke off as he moved.\n\n\"Ryyn, he's coming to,\" the girl's voice cried.\n\nOol looked up. Standing over him were two figures in white tunics. Both\nhad the same blue eyes and short golden hair. He closed his eyes and\nshook his head to clear it, then wished he hadn't.\n\nThe girl laughed happily.\n\n\"You're not seeing double,\" she assured him. \"Don't you remember us?\"\n\nOol opened his eyes once more. The words, the girl's tone, set his\nfuzzy brain to working. Of course--the man was Ryyn, who had been one\nof his best friends at the Academy. Ryyn, whose brilliant mind had\nalready won him a recommendation for a place on the committee; the\nyoungest man ever to be considered.\n\nThen the girl--the girl who had come after him--must be Ryaa, his twin\nsister. Ool remembered her as a slim, boyish kid. There was certainly\nnothing boyish about her appearance now.\n\nOol tried to sit up and instantly Ryaa was by his side, helping him.\n\n\"Just take it easy,\" she advised. \"Ryyn is going to give you something\nto make you feel better.\"\n\n\"Ryaa, I am not in the business of making hangover remedies,\" Ryyn\ngrowled. But at the same time he thrust something into Ool's hand.\n\"Drink,\" he commanded.\n\nOol obeyed, shuddering.\n\n\"Anything that tastes that bad should either kill or cure,\" he said.\n\"Probably be better for me if it killed.\"\n\n\"Don't say that,\" Ryaa cried. \"Ryyn is going to help you, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Nobody can help me.\" He buried his face in his hands. \"For all I know\nI really may have killed them.\"\n\nRyyn nodded.\n\n\"There's always that chance but I don't think so. Anything that\ndeadly would show up in a test. But I'll have to know more about what\nhappened--\"\n\nStep by step he led Ool back over every detail, from his meeting with\neach girl to her death.\n\nRyaa sat beside Ool, her hand in his, trying not to wince when he\ntightened his grip at some painful memory.\n\n\"Thanks,\" Ryyn said at last. \"I think that's all I need right now.\nSorry if I had to hurt you but I'm not in a position to keep up with\nthe news. If we can do anything you'll have Ryaa to thank for it. She\ndragged me away from my experiments and made me promise to do what I\ncould--or else,\" he grinned at his sister, \"she threatened to foul\nthings up and leave me hanging somewhere in space indefinitely.\"\n\nOol stared at the girl beside him. This didn't sound like the quiet\nlittle Ryaa he had known. But her scarlet face showed that at least a\npart of Ryyn's statement was true.\n\n\"Now,\" Ryyn continued, \"I have things to do. Ryaa, why don't you take\nthis big fellow in tow, and the two of you go out and have a good time?\"\n\n\"Do you think it's wise?\" Ool asked.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" Ryaa breathed. Ryyn grinned.\n\n\"I think so. I want you to forget as completely as possible that this\nconversation ever took place. For a few days try not to think about it\nor me. It will help me if you don't.\"\n\nWhen Ool began to be seen in public with another girl, excited whispers\nspread the news rapidly. Sympathetic glances came Ryaa's way but she\nseemed not to notice them. Before long some of her gaiety transferred\nitself to Ool, and for a time he forgot the tragedy hanging over him.\n\nHe was reminded abruptly by a summons from Ryyn.\n\n\"I know the answer,\" he told Ool, \"but we will have to have proof. The\ncommittee has given permission for an experiment. If Ryaa is willing to\ntake a chance--\"\n\n\"I'll do anything to help Ool,\" Ryaa said fervently.\n\n\"I thought so,\" her brother answered. \"So I asked the committee to\ngrant you two permission to mate.\"\n\n\"No,\" Ool cried hoarsely. \"Not Ryaa. I don't want her to die too.\"\n\n\"Nothing will happen to Ryaa if you both do exactly as I say. It's our\nonly chance to prove your innocence. Besides, I've already made the\nannouncement. There's nothing you can do about it now.\"\n\nOol glared at him helplessly, then sank into a chair. Ryaa came to him\nand put her arms around him.\n\n\"You said you were willing to do what Ryyn wanted. So am I. If he says\nI'll be all right, I will.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Ool was only half convinced. \"If it's all right with Ryaa. What\ndo you want us to do.\"\n\n\"Just one thing right now--just stay here till I give the word.\"\n\nRyyn's announcement spread quickly, and the reception was what might\nhave been expected. The people were shocked.\n\n\"I don't think the committee should allow it,\" was the usual comment.\n\n\"There may be more women than men in the Universe, but if Ool keeps on\nmating with them, we'll soon be even,\" remarked someone with misplaced\nhumor.\n\n\n\nWhen Ryyn had decided that the news had spread enough, he gave them the\nword. Ryaa had voted for the space ship to show that she really wasn't\nafraid of the jinx, but Ryyn forbade that. He had personally chosen a\nresort, and had used his influence to overcome the owner's reluctance.\nIt was Ryyn, too, who had the would-be interviewers and most of the\ncurious crowd cleared away.\n\nSeveral of the remarks made by the crowd had started Ool to worrying\nagain. And in spite of her brave remarks, he knew that Ryaa was afraid\ntoo.\n\n\"You don't have to go through with this,\" he told her. \"No one would\nblame you for walking out.\"\n\nRyaa shook her head.\n\n\"It will be all right,\" she insisted. Standing on tiptoe, she caught\nhis face between her hands and pressed her lips to his.\n\n\"That's how much I think of your old curse,\" she murmured and fled into\nthe other room.\n\nWhen she returned she had changed into a sheer blue gown that just\nmatched her eyes, and did nothing to hide her perfectly formed body.\nOol stared. He knew that she had grown up but he hadn't realized how\nbeautiful she had become.\n\nHe took a step toward her. But there, standing beside her, were the\nghostly figures of Loris and Tanya. He stopped abruptly and his arms\nfell to his sides.\n\n\"I must say you don't act much like an ardent bridegroom,\" Ryaa\ncomplained. \"After all, we're supposed to behave normally.\" She caught\nhis arms and drew them around her. Slipping her arms around his neck\nshe raised her face to his.\n\nOol's arms tightened around her and his lips met hers.\n\nBehind Ryaa a chair disintegrated with a whispered sigh, unheard by\nthe lovers. But they did hear the crash of splintering glass as two\nstruggling figures hurtled into the room. Ryaa clung to Ool as the\nfighters threshed around them, unrecognizable at first. Then a slim,\ngolden-haired figure seemed to be forcing his opponent down.\n\n\"Ryyn,\" Ryaa exclaimed. \"But who--\"\n\nThe two figures were struggling over some sort of a weapon. A sudden\ntwist of Ryyn's wrist sent it hurtling across the room. Ool scooped it\nup--a strange sort of gun--and stood ready to aid Ryyn. But it was no\nlonger necessary for Ryyn had pinned the other's arms behind him and\nnow forced him to his feet. He was a dark, squat Martian, who looked\nlike a malevolent frog.\n\n\"Gilk!\" The name broke from Ool's incredulous lips.\n\n\"Gilk,\" Ryyn agreed. \"The only person who had reason to hate you and\nwas clever enough to think up such a fiendish plot. Too clever, really,\nto be caught in such a simple trap, with you two doing your best to\ngive it away. We were lucky that he was mad with hate, so he didn't\nnotice.\" He called out and two guards came into the room, one from the\ndoor and the other through the broken window. Behind them came the\nmembers of the committee.\n\n\"Here's our murderer,\" Ryyn told them. \"It shouldn't be hard to prove\nthat he killed the others now that we saw him try to kill Ryaa and Ool.\"\n\n\"Not Ool,\" Gilk snarled. \"I didn't want him to die. Only her. Ool would\nhave stayed alive to suffer again.\"\n\n\"But why?\" Ool asked. \"We were friends.\"\n\n\"Friends!\" Gilk spat the word at him. \"After all that you did to me. I\ninvented Gilkite--I alone--the only thing powerful enough to halt an\nentire invasion force. But you received all the glory.\"\n\n\"Because you were a coward,\" Ryaa cried, stepping in front of Ool. \"You\nran away and left him to face the entire fleet alone.\"\n\n\"I wasn't a coward,\" Gilk told her in a hurt tone. \"There was always\na chance that something might go wrong; that it might not stop them.\nPatrol Commanders are plentiful enough; Ool could have been replaced.\nBut there is only one Gilk. No one could have replaced me.\" His voice\nrose to a shriek. \"Then Ool took all the credit, and they laughed at\nme. But their great hero isn't a hero any longer.\"\n\n\"You arranged all that, didn't you?\" Ryyn asked.\n\n\"Of course I arranged it. No one else would be clever enough. But\nfor me it was simple. A little preparation of mine, slipped into the\nbride's clothing or perfume. Just a matter of timing. But this time I\ncouldn't get to her things ahead of time. I suppose that was your idea.\nI had to come and do it myself. And I will!\"\n\nWith a swift motion he slipped from Ryyn's grasp. A needle glittered in\nhis hand as he threw himself toward Ryaa.\n\nThe guards stood helpless. Neither of them could fire without hitting\nRyaa. Ryyn started forward but Ool was ahead of him. With one hand he\nsent Ryaa sprawling out of danger. With the other, which still held the\ngun, he struck Gilk a smashing blow across the face.\n\nThe Martian staggered backward, tripped and fell. He screamed once and\nwas still. Ryyn bent over him.\n\n\"He fell on the needle,\" he announced. \"At least it was quick.\"\n\n\"Now I don't suppose that anyone will ever know how to make Gilkite,\"\none of the guards said as they picked up the body.\n\n\"Perhaps it's just as well,\" said the Oldest Man. \"It's too dangerous a\nsecret for anyone to possess. But tell us, Ryyn. What made you think of\nhim?\"\n\nRyyn smiled.\n\n\"The tools of our trades have changed quite a bit through the ages,\" he\nsaid. \"But basically people haven't. The First Murderer that we know of\nkilled his brother out of jealousy. It's still an important motive.\"\n\n\"And with the motive established it wasn't hard to find your killer?\"\nsaid the Oldest Man. \"But you also mentioned that when the experiment\nwas over, you thought that Ool might petition the committee to set\naside this latest mating.\"\n\nRyyn glanced at Ool, kneeling beside Ryaa, gathering her into his arms.\n\n\"I think we'd better forget that part, sir,\" he suggested.\n\n\n\n\n",
