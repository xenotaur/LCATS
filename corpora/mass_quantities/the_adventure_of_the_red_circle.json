    "body": "\"Well, Mrs. Warren, I cannot see that you have any particular cause for\nuneasiness, nor do I understand why I, whose time is of some value,\nshould interfere in the matter.  I really have other things to engage\nme.\"  So spoke Sherlock Holmes and turned back to the great scrapbook\nin which he was arranging and indexing some of his recent material.\n\nBut the landlady had the pertinacity and also the cunning of her sex.\nShe held her ground firmly.\n\n\"You arranged an affair for a lodger of mine last year,\" she said--\"Mr.\nFairdale Hobbs.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes--a simple matter.\"\n\n\"But he would never cease talking of it--your kindness, sir, and the\nway in which you brought light into the darkness.  I remembered his\nwords when I was in doubt and darkness myself.  I know you could if you\nonly would.\"\n\nHolmes was accessible upon the side of flattery, and also, to do him\njustice, upon the side of kindliness.  The two forces made him lay down\nhis gum-brush with a sigh of resignation and push back his chair.\n\n\"Well, well, Mrs. Warren, let us hear about it, then.  You don't object\nto tobacco, I take it?  Thank you, Watson--the matches! You are uneasy,\nas I understand, because your new lodger remains in his rooms and you\ncannot see him.  Why, bless you, Mrs. Warren, if I were your lodger you\noften would not see me for weeks on end.\"\n\n\"No doubt, sir; but this is different.  It frightens me, Mr. Holmes.  I\ncan't sleep for fright.  To hear his quick step moving here and moving\nthere from early morning to late at night, and yet never to catch so\nmuch as a glimpse of him--it's more than I can stand.  My husband is as\nnervous over it as I am, but he is out at his work all day, while I get\nno rest from it.  What is he hiding for?  What has he done?  Except for\nthe girl, I am all alone in the house with him, and it's more than my\nnerves can stand.\"\n\nHolmes leaned forward and laid his long, thin fingers upon the woman's\nshoulder.  He had an almost hypnotic power of soothing when he wished.\nThe scared look faded from her eyes, and her agitated features smoothed\ninto their usual commonplace.  She sat down in the chair which he had\nindicated.\n\n\"If I take it up I must understand every detail,\" said he.  \"Take time\nto consider.  The smallest point may be the most essential. You say\nthat the man came ten days ago and paid you for a fortnight's board and\nlodging?\"\n\n\"He asked my terms, sir.  I said fifty shillings a week.  There is a\nsmall sitting-room and bedroom, and all complete, at the top of the\nhouse.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"He said, 'I'll pay you five pounds a week if I can have it on my own\nterms.'  I'm a poor woman, sir, and Mr. Warren earns little, and the\nmoney meant much to me.  He took out a ten-pound note, and he held it\nout to me then and there.  'You can have the same every fortnight for a\nlong time to come if you keep the terms,' he said.  'If not, I'll have\nno more to do with you.'\n\n\"What were the terms?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, they were that he was to have a key of the house. That was\nall right.  Lodgers often have them.  Also, that he was to be left\nentirely to himself and never, upon any excuse, to be disturbed.\"\n\n\"Nothing wonderful in that, surely?\"\n\n\"Not in reason, sir.  But this is out of all reason.  He has been there\nfor ten days, and neither Mr. Warren, nor I, nor the girl has once set\neyes upon him.  We can hear that quick step of his pacing up and down,\nup and down, night, morning, and noon; but except on that first night\nhe had never once gone out of the house.\"\n\n\"Oh, he went out the first night, did he?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, and returned very late--after we were all in bed.  He told\nme after he had taken the rooms that he would do so and asked me not to\nbar the door.  I heard him come up the stair after midnight.\"\n\n\"But his meals?\"\n\n\"It was his particular direction that we should always, when he rang,\nleave his meal upon a chair, outside his door.  Then he rings again\nwhen he has finished, and we take it down from the same chair.  If he\nwants anything else he prints it on a slip of paper and leaves it.\"\n\n\"Prints it?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; prints it in pencil.  Just the word, nothing more. Here's\nthe one I brought to show you--soap.  Here's another--match. This is\none he left the first morning--daily gazette.  I leave that paper with\nhis breakfast every morning.\"\n\n\"Dear me, Watson,\" said Homes, staring with great curiosity at the\nslips of foolscap which the landlady had handed to him, \"this is\ncertainly a little unusual.  Seclusion I can understand; but why print?\nPrinting is a clumsy process.  Why not write?  What would it suggest,\nWatson?\"\n\n\"That he desired to conceal his handwriting.\"\n\n\"But why?  What can it matter to him that his landlady should have a\nword of his writing?  Still, it may be as you say.  Then, again, why\nsuch laconic messages?\"\n\n\"I cannot imagine.\"\n\n\"It opens a pleasing field for intelligent speculation.  The words are\nwritten with a broad-pointed, violet-tinted pencil of a not unusual\npattern.  You will observe that the paper is torn away at the side here\nafter the printing was done, so that the 's' of 'soap' is partly gone.\nSuggestive, Watson, is it not?\"\n\n\"Of caution?\"\n\n\"Exactly.  There was evidently some mark, some thumbprint, something\nwhich might give a clue to the person's identity.  Now. Mrs. Warren,\nyou say that the man was of middle size, dark, and bearded.  What age\nwould he be?\"\n\n\"Youngish, sir--not over thirty.\"\n\n\"Well, can you give me no further indications?\"\n\n\"He spoke good English, sir, and yet I thought he was a foreigner by\nhis accent.\"\n\n\"And he was well dressed?\"\n\n\"Very smartly dressed, sir--quite the gentleman.  Dark clothes--nothing\nyou would note.\"\n\n\"He gave no name?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"And has had no letters or callers?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"But surely you or the girl enter his room of a morning?\"\n\n\"No, sir; he looks after himself entirely.\"\n\n\"Dear me! that is certainly remarkable.  What about his luggage?\"\n\n\"He had one big brown bag with him--nothing else.\"\n\n\"Well, we don't seem to have much material to help us.  Do you say\nnothing has come out of that room--absolutely nothing?\"\n\nThe landlady drew an envelope from her bag; from it she shook out two\nburnt matches and a cigarette-end upon the table.\n\n\"They were on his tray this morning.  I brought them because I had\nheard that you can read great things out of small ones.\"\n\nHolmes shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"There is nothing here,\" said he.  \"The matches have, of course, been\nused to light cigarettes.  That is obvious from the shortness of the\nburnt end.  Half the match is consumed in lighting a pipe or cigar.\nBut, dear me! this cigarette stub is certainly remarkable.  The\ngentleman was bearded and moustached, you say?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I don't understand that.  I should say that only a clean-shaven man\ncould have smoked this.  Why, Watson, even your modest moustache would\nhave been singed.\"\n\n\"A holder?\" I suggested.\n\n\"No, no; the end is matted.  I suppose there could not be two people in\nyour rooms, Mrs. Warren?\"\n\n\"No, sir.  He eats so little that I often wonder it can keep life in\none.\"\n\n\"Well, I think we must wait for a little more material.  After all, you\nhave nothing to complain of.  You have received your rent, and he is\nnot a troublesome lodger, though he is certainly an unusual one.  He\npays you well, and if he chooses to lie concealed it is no direct\nbusiness of yours.  We have no excuse for an intrusion upon his privacy\nuntil we have some reason to think that there is a guilty reason for\nit.  I've taken up the matter, and I won't lose sight of it.  Report to\nme if anything fresh occurs, and rely upon my assistance if it should\nbe needed.\n\n\"There are certainly some points of interest in this case, Watson,\" he\nremarked when the landlady had left us.  \"It may, of course, be\ntrivial--individual eccentricity; or it may be very much deeper than\nappears on the surface.  The first thing that strikes one is the obvious\npossibility that the person now in the rooms may be entirely different\nfrom the one who engaged them.\"\n\n\"Why should you think so?\"\n\n\"Well, apart from this cigarette-end, was it not suggestive that the\nonly time the lodger went out was immediately after his taking the\nrooms?  He came back--or someone came back--when all witnesses were out\nof the way.  We have no proof that the person who came back was the\nperson who went out.  Then, again, the man who took the rooms spoke\nEnglish well.  This other, however, prints 'match' when it should have\nbeen 'matches.'  I can imagine that the word was taken out of a\ndictionary, which would give the noun but not the plural.  The laconic\nstyle may be to conceal the absence of knowledge of English.  Yes,\nWatson, there are good reasons to suspect that there has been a\nsubstitution of lodgers.\"\n\n\"But for what possible end?\"\n\n\"Ah! there lies our problem.  There is one rather obvious line of\ninvestigation.\"  He took down the great book in which, day by day, he\nfiled the agony columns of the various London journals. \"Dear me!\" said\nhe, turning over the pages, \"what a chorus of groans, cries, and\nbleatings!  What a rag-bag of singular happenings!  But surely the most\nvaluable hunting-ground that ever was given to a student of the\nunusual!  This person is alone and cannot be approached by letter\nwithout a breach of that absolute secrecy which is desired.  How is any\nnews or any message to reach him from without?  Obviously by\nadvertisement through a newspaper.  There seems no other way, and\nfortunately we need concern ourselves with the one paper only.  Here\nare the Daily Gazette extracts of the last fortnight.  'Lady with a\nblack boa at Prince's Skating Club'--that we may pass.  'Surely Jimmy\nwill not break his mother's heart'--that appears to be irrelevant.  'If\nthe lady who fainted on Brixton bus'--she does not interest me.  'Every\nday my heart longs--' Bleat, Watson--unmitigated bleat!  Ah, this is a\nlittle more possible.  Listen to this:  'Be patient.  Will find some\nsure means of communications.  Meanwhile, this column.  G.'  That is\ntwo days after Mrs. Warren's lodger arrived.  It sounds plausible, does\nit not?  The mysterious one could understand English, even if he could\nnot print it.  Let us see if we can pick up the trace again.  Yes, here\nwe are--three days later.  'Am making successful arrangements.\nPatience and prudence.  The clouds will pass.  G.'  Nothing for a week\nafter that.  Then comes something much more definite:  'The path is\nclearing.  If I find chance signal message remember code agreed--One A,\ntwo B, and so on. You will hear soon.  G.'  That was in yesterday's\npaper, and there is nothing in to-day's. It's all very appropriate to\nMrs. Warren's lodger.  If we wait a little, Watson, I don't doubt that\nthe affair will grow more intelligible.\"\n\nSo it proved; for in the morning I found my friend standing on the\nhearthrug with his back to the fire and a smile of complete\nsatisfaction upon his face.\n\n\"How's this, Watson?\" he cried, picking up the paper from the table.\n\"'High red house with white stone facings.  Third floor. Second window\nleft.  After dusk.  G.'  That is definite enough. I think after\nbreakfast we must make a little reconnaissance of Mrs. Warren's\nneighbourhood.  Ah, Mrs. Warren! what news do you bring us this\nmorning?\"\n\nOur client had suddenly burst into the room with an explosive energy\nwhich told of some new and momentous development.\n\n\"It's a police matter, Mr. Holmes!\" she cried.  \"I'll have no more of\nit!  He shall pack out of there with his baggage.  I would have gone\nstraight up and told him so, only I thought it was but fair to you to\ntake your opinion first.  But I'm at the end of my patience, and when\nit comes to knocking my old man about--\"\n\n\"Knocking Mr. Warren about?\"\n\n\"Using him roughly, anyway.\"\n\n\"But who used him roughly?\"\n\n\"Ah! that's what we want to know!  It was this morning, sir.  Mr.\nWarren is a timekeeper at Morton and Waylight's, in Tottenham Court\nRoad.  He has to be out of the house before seven. Well, this morning\nhe had not gone ten paces down the road when two men came up behind\nhim, threw a coat over his head, and bundled him into a cab that was\nbeside the curb.  They drove him an hour, and then opened the door and\nshot him out.  He lay in the roadway so shaken in his wits that he\nnever saw what became of the cab. When he picked himself up he found he\nwas on Hampstead Heath; so he took a bus home, and there he lies now on\nhis sofa, while I came straight round to tell you what had happened.\"\n\n\"Most interesting,\" said Holmes.  \"Did he observe the appearance of\nthese men--did he hear them talk?\"\n\n\"No; he is clean dazed.  He just knows that he was lifted up as if by\nmagic and dropped as if by magic. Two at least were in it, and maybe\nthree.\"\n\n\"And you connect this attack with your lodger?\"\n\n\"Well, we've lived there fifteen years and no such happenings ever came\nbefore.  I've had enough of him.  Money's not everything. I'll have him\nout of my house before the day is done.\"\n\n\"Wait a bit, Mrs. Warren.  Do nothing rash. I begin to think that this\naffair may be very much more important than appeared at first sight.\nIt is clear now that some danger is threatening your lodger.  It is\nequally clear that his enemies, lying in wait for him near your door,\nmistook your husband for him in the foggy morning light.  On\ndiscovering their mistake they released him. What they would have done\nhad it not been a mistake, we can only conjecture.\"\n\n\"Well, what am I to do, Mr. Holmes?\"\n\n\"I have a great fancy to see this lodger of yours, Mrs. Warren.\"\n\n\"I don't see how that is to be managed, unless you break in the door.\nI always hear him unlock it as I go down the stair after I leave the\ntray.\"\n\n\"He has to take the tray in.  Surely we could conceal ourselves and see\nhim do it.\"\n\nThe landlady thought for a moment.\n\n\"Well, sir, there's the box-room opposite.  I could arrange a\nlooking-glass, maybe, and if you were behind the door--\"\n\n\"Excellent!\" said Holmes.  \"When does he lunch?\"\n\n\"About one, sir.\"\n\n\"Then Dr. Watson and I will come round in time.  For the present, Mrs.\nWarren, good-bye.\"\n\nAt half-past twelve we found ourselves upon the steps of Mrs. Warren's\nhouse--a high, thin, yellow-brick edifice in Great Orme Street, a\nnarrow thoroughfare at the northeast side of the British Museum.\nStanding as it does near the corner of the street,  it commands a view\ndown Howe Street, with its more pretentious houses.  Holmes pointed with\na chuckle to one of these, a row of residential flats, which projected\nso that they could not fail to catch the eye.\n\n\"See, Watson!\" said he.  \"'High red house with stone facings.' There is\nthe signal station all right.  We know the place, and we know the code;\nso surely our task should be simple.  There's a 'to let' card in that\nwindow.  It is evidently an empty flat to which the confederate has\naccess.  Well, Mrs. Warren, what now?\"\n\n\"I have it all ready for you.  If you will both come up and leave your\nboots below on the landing, I'll put you there now.\"\n\nIt was an excellent hiding-place which she had arranged.  The mirror\nwas so placed that, seated in the dark, we could very plainly see the\ndoor opposite.  We had hardly settled down in it, and Mrs. Warren left\nus, when a distant tinkle announced that our mysterious neighbour had\nrung.  Presently the landlady appeared with the tray, laid it down upon\na chair beside the closed door, and then, treading heavily, departed.\nCrouching together in the angle of the door, we kept our eyes fixed\nupon the mirror. Suddenly, as the landlady's footsteps died away, there\nwas the creak of a turning key, the handle revolved, and two thin hands\ndarted out and lifted the tray from the chair.  An instant later it was\nhurriedly replaced, and I caught a glimpse of a dark, beautiful,\nhorrified face glaring at the narrow opening of the box-room.  Then the\ndoor crashed to, the key turned once more, and all was silence. Holmes\ntwitched my sleeve, and together we stole down the stair.\n\n\"I will call again in the evening,\" said he to the expectant landlady.\n\"I think, Watson, we can discuss this business better in our own\nquarters.\"\n\n\"My surmise, as you saw, proved to be correct,\" said he, speaking from\nthe depths of his easy-chair.  \"There has been a substitution of\nlodgers.  What I did not foresee is that we should find a woman, and no\nordinary woman, Watson.\"\n\n\"She saw us.\"\n\n\"Well, she saw something to alarm her.  That is certain.  The general\nsequence of events is pretty clear, is it not?  A couple seek refuge in\nLondon from a very terrible and instant danger. The measure of that\ndanger is the rigour of their precautions. The man, who has some work\nwhich he must do, desires to leave the woman in absolute safety while\nhe does it.  It is not an easy problem, but he solved it in an original\nfashion, and so effectively that her presence was not even known to the\nlandlady who supplies her with food.  The printed messages, as is now\nevident, were to prevent her sex being discovered by her writing. The\nman cannot come near the woman, or he will guide their enemies to her.\nSince he cannot communicate with her direct, he has recourse to the\nagony column of a paper.  So far all is clear.\"\n\n\"But what is at the root of it?\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, Watson--severely practical, as usual!  What is at the root of\nit all?  Mrs. Warren's whimsical problem enlarges somewhat and assumes\na more sinister aspect as we proceed.  This much we can say:  that it\nis no ordinary love escapade.  You saw the woman's face at the sign of\ndanger.  We have heard, too, of the attack upon the landlord, which was\nundoubtedly meant for the lodger.  These alarms, and the desperate need\nfor secrecy, argue that the matter is one of life or death.  The attack\nupon Mr. Warren further shows that the enemy, whoever they are, are\nthemselves not aware of the substitution of the female lodger for the\nmale.  It is very curious and complex, Watson.\"\n\n\"Why should you go further in it?  What have you to gain from it?\"\n\n\"What, indeed?  It is art for art's sake, Watson.  I suppose when you\ndoctored you found yourself studying cases without thought of a fee?\"\n\n\"For my education, Holmes.\"\n\n\"Education never ends, Watson.  It is a series of lessons with the\ngreatest for the last.  This is an instructive case.  There is neither\nmoney nor credit in it, and yet one would wish to tidy it up.  When\ndusk comes we should find ourselves one stage advanced in our\ninvestigation.\"\n\nWhen we returned to Mrs. Warren's rooms, the gloom of a London winter\nevening had thickened into one gray curtain, a dead monotone of colour,\nbroken only by the sharp yellow squares of the windows and the blurred\nhaloes of the gas-lamps.  As we peered from the darkened sitting-room\nof the lodging-house, one more dim light glimmered high up through the\nobscurity.\n\n\"Someone is moving in that room,\" said Holmes in a whisper, his gaunt\nand eager face thrust forward to the window-pane.  \"Yes, I can see his\nshadow.  There he is again!  He has a candle in his hand.  Now he is\npeering across.  He wants to be sure that she is on the lookout.  Now\nhe begins to flash.  Take the message also, Watson, that we may check\neach other.  A single flash--that is A, surely.  Now, then.  How many\ndid you make it?  Twenty.  So did I.  That should mean T.  AT--that's\nintelligible enough. Another T.  Surely this is the beginning of a\nsecond word.  Now, then--TENTA. Dead stop.  That can't be all, Watson?\nATTENTA gives no sense.  Nor is it any better as three words AT, TEN,\nTA, unless T. A. are a person's initials.  There it goes again! What's\nthat?  ATTE--why, it is the same message over again. Curious, Watson,\nvery curious.  Now he is off once more!  AT--why he is repeating it for\nthe third time.  ATTENTA three times!  How often will he repeat it?\nNo, that seems to be the finish.  He has withdrawn from the window.\nWhat do you make of it, Watson?\"\n\n\"A cipher message, Holmes.\"\n\nMy companion gave a sudden chuckle of comprehension.  \"And not a very\nobscure cipher, Watson,\" said he.  \"Why, of course, it is Italian!  The\nA means that it is addressed to a woman.  'Beware! Beware!  Beware!'\nHow's that, Watson?\n\n\"I believe you have hit it.\"\n\n\"Not a doubt of it.  It is a very urgent message, thrice repeated to\nmake it more so.  But beware of what?  Wait a bit, he is coming to the\nwindow once more.\"\n\nAgain we saw the dim silhouette of a crouching man and the whisk of the\nsmall flame across the window as the signals were renewed. They came\nmore rapidly than before--so rapid that it was hard to follow them.\n\n\"PERICOLO--pericolo--eh, what's that, Watson?  'Danger,' isn't it?\nYes, by Jove, it's a danger signal.  There he goes again! PERI.\nHalloa, what on earth--\"\n\nThe light had suddenly gone out, the glimmering square of window had\ndisappeared, and the third floor formed a dark band round the lofty\nbuilding, with its tiers of shining casements.  That last warning cry\nhad been suddenly cut short.  How, and by whom?  The same thought\noccurred on the instant to us both.  Holmes sprang up from where he\ncrouched by the window.\n\n\"This is serious, Watson,\" he cried.  \"There is some devilry going\nforward!  Why should such a message stop in such a way?  I should put\nScotland Yard in touch with this business--and yet, it is too pressing\nfor us to leave.\"\n\n\"Shall I go for the police?\"\n\n\"We must define the situation a little more clearly.  It may bear some\nmore innocent interpretation.  Come, Watson, let us go across ourselves\nand see what we can make of it.\"\n\n\n\n\nTwo\n\n\n\nAs we walked rapidly down Howe Street I glanced back at the building\nwhich we had left.  There, dimly outlined at the top window, I could\nsee the shadow of a head, a woman's head, gazing tensely, rigidly, out\ninto the night, waiting with breathless suspense for the renewal of\nthat interrupted message.  At the doorway of the Howe Street flats a\nman, muffled in a cravat and greatcoat, was leaning against the\nrailing.  He started as the hall-light fell upon our faces.\n\n\"Holmes!\" he cried.\n\n\"Why, Gregson!\" said my companion as he shook hands with the Scotland\nYard detective.  \"Journeys end with lovers' meetings. What brings you\nhere?\"\n\n\"The same reasons that bring you, I expect,\" said Gregson.  \"How you\ngot on to it I can't imagine.\"\n\n\"Different threads, but leading up to the same tangle.  I've been\ntaking the signals.\"\n\n\"Signals?\"\n\n\"Yes, from that window.  They broke off in the middle.  We came over to\nsee the reason.  But since it is safe in your hands I see no object in\ncontinuing this business.\"\n\n\"Wait a bit!\" cried Gregson eagerly.  \"I'll do you this justice, Mr.\nHolmes, that I was never in a case yet that I didn't feel stronger for\nhaving you on my side.  There's only the one exit to these flats, so we\nhave him safe.\"\n\n\"Who is he?\"\n\n\"Well, well, we score over you for once, Mr. Holmes.  You must give us\nbest this time.\"  He struck his stick sharply upon the ground, on which\na cabman, his whip in his hand, sauntered over from a four-wheeler\nwhich stood on the far side of the street. \"May I introduce you to Mr.\nSherlock Holmes?\" he said to the cabman.  \"This is Mr. Leverton, of\nPinkerton's American Agency.\"\n\n\"The hero of the Long Island cave mystery?\" said Holmes.  \"Sir, I am\npleased to meet you.\"\n\nThe American, a quiet, businesslike young man, with a clean-shaven,\nhatchet face, flushed up at the words of commendation. \"I am on the\ntrail of my life now, Mr. Holmes,\" said he.  \"If I can get Gorgiano--\"\n\n\"What!  Gorgiano of the Red Circle?\"\n\n\"Oh, he has a European fame, has he?  Well, we've learned all about him\nin America.  We KNOW he is at the bottom of fifty murders, and yet we\nhave nothing positive we can take him on.  I tracked him over from New\nYork, and I've been close to him for a week in London, waiting some\nexcuse to get my hand on his collar. Mr. Gregson and I ran him to\nground in that big tenement house, and there's only one door, so he\ncan't slip us.  There's three folk come out since he went in, but I'll\nswear he wasn't one of them.\"\n\n\"Mr. Holmes talks of signals,\" said Gregson.  \"I expect, as usual, he\nknows a good deal that we don't.\"\n\nIn a few clear words Holmes explained the situation as it had appeared\nto us.  The American struck his hands together with vexation.\n\n\"He's on to us!\" he cried.\n\n\"Why do you think so?\"\n\n\"Well, it figures out that way, does it not?  Here he is, sending out\nmessages to an accomplice--there are several of his gang in London.\nThen suddenly, just as by your own account he was telling them that\nthere was danger, he broke short off.  What could it mean except that\nfrom the window he had suddenly either caught sight of us in the\nstreet, or in some way come to understand how close the danger was, and\nthat he must act right away if he was to avoid it?  What do you\nsuggest, Mr. Holmes?\"\n\n\"That we go up at once and see for ourselves.\"\n\n\"But we have no warrant for his arrest.\"\n\n\"He is in unoccupied premises under suspicious circumstances,\" said\nGregson.  \"That is good enough for the moment.  When we have him by the\nheels we can see if New York can't help us to keep him.  I'll take the\nresponsibility of arresting him now.\"\n\nOur official detectives may blunder in the matter of intelligence, but\nnever in that of courage.  Gregson climbed the stair to arrest this\ndesperate murderer with the same absolutely quiet and businesslike\nbearing with which he would have ascended the official staircase of\nScotland Yard.  The Pinkerton man had tried to push past him, but\nGregson had firmly elbowed him back. London dangers were the privilege\nof the London force.\n\nThe door of the left-hand flat upon the third landing was standing\najar.  Gregson pushed it open.  Within all was absolute silence and\ndarkness.  I struck a match and lit the detective's lantern.  As I did\nso, and as the flicker steadied into a flame, we all gave a gasp of\nsurprise.  On the deal boards of the carpetless floor there was\noutlined a fresh track of blood.  The red steps pointed towards us and\nled away from an inner room, the door of which was closed.  Gregson\nflung it open and held his light full blaze in front of him, while we\nall peered eagerly over his shoulders.\n\nIn the middle of the floor of the empty room was huddled the figure of\nan enormous man, his clean-shaven, swarthy face grotesquely horrible in\nits contortion and his head encircled by a ghastly crimson halo of\nblood, lying in a broad wet circle upon the white woodwork.  His knees\nwere drawn up, his hands thrown out in agony, and from the centre of\nhis broad, brown, upturned throat there projected the white haft of a\nknife driven blade-deep into his body.  Giant as he was, the man must\nhave gone down like a pole-axed ox before that terrific blow.  Beside\nhis right hand a most formidable horn-handled, two-edged dagger lay\nupon the floor, and near it a black kid glove.\n\n\"By George! it's Black Gorgiano himself!\" cried the American detective.\n\"Someone has got ahead of us this time.\"\n\n\"Here is the candle in the window, Mr. Holmes,\" said Gregson. \"Why,\nwhatever are you doing?\"\n\nHolmes had stepped across, had lit the candle, and was passing it\nbackward and forward across the window-panes.  Then he peered into the\ndarkness, blew the candle out, and threw it on the floor.\n\n\"I rather think that will be helpful,\" said he.  He came over and stood\nin deep thought while the two professionals were examining the body.\n\"You say that three people came out from the flat while you were\nwaiting downstairs,\" said he at last.  \"Did you observe them closely?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did.\"\n\n\"Was there a fellow about thirty, black-bearded, dark, of middle size?\"\n\n\"Yes; he was the last to pass me.\"\n\n\"That is your man, I fancy.  I can give you his description, and we\nhave a very excellent outline of his footmark.  That should be enough\nfor you.\"\n\n\"Not much, Mr. Holmes, among the millions of London.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not. That is why I thought it best to summon this lady to your\naid.\"\n\nWe all turned round at the words.  There, framed in the doorway, was a\ntall and beautiful woman--the mysterious lodger of Bloomsbury.  Slowly\nshe advanced, her face pale and drawn with a frightful apprehension,\nher eyes fixed and staring, her terrified gaze riveted upon the dark\nfigure on the floor.\n\n\"You have killed him!\" she muttered.  \"Oh, Dio mio, you have killed\nhim!\"  Then I heard a sudden sharp intake of her breath, and she sprang\ninto the air with a cry of joy.  Round and round the room she danced,\nher hands clapping, her dark eyes gleaming with delighted wonder, and a\nthousand pretty Italian exclamations pouring from her lips.  It was\nterrible and amazing to see such a woman so convulsed with joy at such\na sight.  Suddenly she stopped and gazed at us all with a questioning\nstare.\n\n\"But you!  You are police, are you not?  You have killed Giuseppe\nGorgiano.  Is it not so?\"\n\n\"We are police, madam.\"\n\nShe looked round into the shadows of the room.\n\n\"But where, then, is Gennaro?\" she asked.  \"He is my husband, Gennaro\nLucca.  I am Emilia Lucca, and we are both from New York. Where is\nGennaro?  He called me this moment from this window, and I ran with all\nmy speed.\"\n\n\"It was I who called,\" said Holmes.\n\n\"You!  How could you call?\"\n\n\"Your cipher was not difficult, madam.  Your presence here was\ndesirable. I knew that I had only to flash 'Vieni' and you would surely\ncome.\"\n\nThe beautiful Italian looked with awe at my companion.\n\n\"I do not understand how you know these things,\" she said. \"Giuseppe\nGorgiano--how did he--\"  She paused, and then suddenly her face lit up\nwith pride and delight.  \"Now I see it!  My Gennaro!  My splendid,\nbeautiful Gennaro, who has guarded me safe from all harm, he did it,\nwith his own strong hand he killed the monster!  Oh, Gennaro, how\nwonderful you are!  What woman could ever be worthy of such a man?\"\n\n\"Well, Mrs. Lucca,\" said the prosaic Gregson, laying his hand upon the\nlady's sleeve with as little sentiment as if she were a Notting Hill\nhooligan, \"I am not very clear yet who you are or what you are; but\nyou've said enough to make it very clear that we shall want you at the\nYard.\"\n\n\"One moment, Gregson,\" said Holmes.  \"I rather fancy that this lady may\nbe as anxious to give us information as we can be to get it.  You\nunderstand, madam, that your husband will be arrested and tried for the\ndeath of the man who lies before us?  What you say may be used in\nevidence.  But if you think that he has acted from motives which are\nnot criminal, and which he would wish to have known, then you cannot\nserve him better than by telling us the whole story.\"\n\n\"Now that Gorgiano is dead we fear nothing,\" said the lady.  \"He was a\ndevil and a monster, and there can be no judge in the world who would\npunish my husband for having killed him.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Holmes, \"my suggestion is that we lock this door,\nleave things as we found them, go with this lady to her room, and form\nour opinion after we have heard what it is that she has to say to us.\"\n\nHalf an hour later we were seated, all four, in the small sitting-room\nof Signora Lucca, listening to her remarkable narrative of those\nsinister events, the ending of which we had chanced to witness.  She\nspoke in rapid and fluent but very unconventional English, which, for\nthe sake of clearness, I will make grammatical.\n\n\"I was born in Posilippo, near Naples,\" said she, \"and was the daughter\nof Augusto Barelli, who was the chief lawyer and once the deputy of\nthat part.  Gennaro was in my father's employment, and I came to love\nhim, as any woman must.  He had neither money nor position--nothing but\nhis beauty and strength and energy--so my father forbade the match.  We\nfled together, were married at Bari, and sold my jewels to gain the\nmoney which would take us to America.  This was four years ago, and we\nhave been in New York ever since.\n\n\"Fortune was very good to us at first.  Gennaro was able to do a\nservice to an Italian gentleman--he saved him from some ruffians in the\nplace called the Bowery, and so made a powerful friend. His name was\nTito Castalotte, and he was the senior partner of the great firm of\nCastalotte and Zamba, who are the chief fruit importers of New York.\nSignor Zamba is an invalid, and our new friend Castalotte has all power\nwithin the firm, which employs more than three hundred men.  He took my\nhusband into his employment, made him head of a department, and showed\nhis good-will towards him in every way.  Signor Castalotte was a\nbachelor, and I believe that he felt as if Gennaro was his son, and\nboth my husband and I loved him as if he were our father.  We had taken\nand furnished a little house in Brooklyn, and our whole future seemed\nassured when that black cloud appeared which was soon to overspread our\nsky.\n\n\"One night, when Gennaro returned from his work, he brought a\nfellow-countryman back with him.  His name was Gorgiano, and he had\ncome also from Posilippo.  He was a huge man, as you can testify, for\nyou have looked upon his corpse.  Not only was his body that of a giant\nbut everything about him was grotesque, gigantic, and terrifying.  His\nvoice was like thunder in our little house.  There was scarce room for\nthe whirl of his great arms as he talked.  His thoughts, his emotions,\nhis passions, all were exaggerated and monstrous.  He talked, or rather\nroared, with such energy that others could but sit and listen, cowed\nwith the mighty stream of words.  His eyes blazed at you and held you\nat his mercy.  He was a terrible and wonderful man.  I thank God that\nhe is dead!\n\n\"He came again and again.  Yet I was aware that Gennaro was no more\nhappy than I was in his presence.  My poor husband would sit pale and\nlistless, listening to the endless raving upon politics and upon social\nquestions which made up our visitor's conversation.  Gennaro said\nnothing, but I, who knew him so well, could read in his face some\nemotion which I had never seen there before.  At first I thought that\nit was dislike.  And then, gradually, I understood that it was more\nthan dislike.  It was fear--a deep, secret, shrinking fear.  That\nnight--the night that I read his terror--I put my arms round him and I\nimplored him by his love for me and by all that he held dear to hold\nnothing from me, and to tell me why this huge man overshadowed him so.\n\n\"He told me, and my own heart grew cold as ice as I listened.  My poor\nGennaro, in his wild and fiery days, when all the world seemed against\nhim and his mind was driven half mad by the injustices of life, had\njoined a Neapolitan society, the Red Circle, which was allied to the\nold Carbonari.  The oaths and secrets of this brotherhood were\nfrightful, but once within its rule no escape was possible.  When we\nhad fled to America Gennaro thought that he had cast it all off\nforever. What was his horror one evening to meet in the streets the\nvery man who had initiated him in Naples, the giant Gorgiano, a man who\nhad earned the name of 'Death' in the south of Italy, for he was red to\nthe elbow in murder!  He had come to New York to avoid the Italian\npolice, and he had already planted a branch of this dreadful society in\nhis new home.  All this Gennaro told me and showed me a summons which\nhe had received that very day, a Red Circle drawn upon the head of it\ntelling him that a lodge would be held upon a certain date, and that\nhis presence at it was required and ordered.\n\n\"That was bad enough, but worse was to come.  I had noticed for some\ntime that when Gorgiano came to us, as he constantly did, in the\nevening, he spoke much to me; and even when his words were to my\nhusband those terrible, glaring, wild-beast eyes of his were always\nturned upon me.  One night his secret came out.  I had awakened what he\ncalled 'love' within him--the love of a brute--a savage.  Gennaro had\nnot yet returned when he came.  He pushed his way in, seized me in his\nmighty arms, hugged me in his bear's embrace, covered me with kisses,\nand implored me to come away with him.  I was struggling and screaming\nwhen Gennaro entered and attacked him.  He struck Gennaro senseless and\nfled from the house which he was never more to enter.  It was a deadly\nenemy that we made that night.\n\n\"A few days later came the meeting.  Gennaro returned from it with a\nface which told me that something dreadful had occurred. It was worse\nthan we could have imagined possible.  The funds of the society were\nraised by blackmailing rich Italians and threatening them with violence\nshould they refuse the money. It seems that Castalotte, our dear friend\nand benefactor, had been approached.  He had refused to yield to\nthreats, and he had handed the notices to the police.  It was resolved\nnow that such an example should be made of them as would prevent any\nother victim from rebelling. At the meeting it was arranged that he and\nhis house should be blown up with dynamite.  There was a drawing of\nlots as to who should carry out the deed.  Gennaro saw our enemy's\ncruel face smiling at him as he dipped his hand in the bag. No doubt it\nhad been prearranged in some fashion, for it was the fatal disc with\nthe Red Circle upon it, the mandate for murder, which lay upon his\npalm.  He was to kill his best friend, or he was to expose himself and\nme to the vengeance of his comrades.  It was part of their fiendish\nsystem to punish those whom they feared or hated by injuring not only\ntheir own persons but those whom they loved, and it was the knowledge\nof this which hung as a terror over my poor Gennaro's head and drove\nhim nearly crazy with apprehension.\n\n\"All that night we sat together, our arms round each other, each\nstrengthening each for the troubles that lay before us.  The very next\nevening had been fixed for the attempt.  By midday my husband and I\nwere on our way to London, but not before he had given our benefactor\nfull warning of this danger, and had also left such information for the\npolice as would safeguard his life for the future.\n\n\"The rest, gentlemen, you know for yourselves.  We were sure that our\nenemies would be behind us like our own shadows.  Gorgiano had his\nprivate reasons for vengeance, but in any case we knew how ruthless,\ncunning, and untiring he could be.  Both Italy and America are full of\nstories of his dreadful powers.  If ever they were exerted it would be\nnow.  My darling made use of the few clear days which our start had\ngiven us in arranging for a refuge for me in such a fashion that no\npossible danger could reach me. For his own part, he wished to be free\nthat he might communicate both with the American and with the Italian\npolice.  I do not myself know where he lived, or how.  All that I\nlearned was through the columns of a newspaper.  But once as I looked\nthrough my window, I saw two Italians watching the house, and I\nunderstood that in some way Gorgiano had found our retreat. Finally\nGennaro told me, through the paper, that he would signal to me from a\ncertain window, but when the signals came they were nothing but\nwarnings, which were suddenly interrupted.  It is very clear to me now\nthat he knew Gorgiano to be close upon him, and that, thank God! he was\nready for him when he came.  And now, gentleman, I would ask you\nwhether we have anything to fear from the law, or whether any judge\nupon earth would condemn my Gennaro for what he has done?\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Gregson,\" said the American, looking across at the official,\n\"I don't know what your British point of view may be, but I guess that\nin New York this lady's husband will receive a pretty general vote of\nthanks.\"\n\n\"She will have to come with me and see the chief,\" Gregson answered.\n\"If what she says is corroborated, I do not think she or her husband\nhas much to fear.  But what I can't make head or tail of, Mr. Holmes,\nis how on earth YOU got yourself mixed up in the matter.\"\n\n\"Education, Gregson, education.  Still seeking knowledge at the old\nuniversity.  Well, Watson, you have one more specimen of the tragic and\ngrotesque to add to your collection.  By the way, it is not eight\no'clock, and a Wagner night at Covent Garden!  If we hurry, we might be\nin time for the second act.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
