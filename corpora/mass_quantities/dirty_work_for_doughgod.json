    "body": "Author of \u201cFor the Parson of Paradise,\u201d \u201cJay Bird\u2019s Judgment,\u201d etc.\n\n\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d says Mike Pelly. \u201cNo more female teachers for Paradise.\n\u2019Cause why? \u2019Cause all the fool punchers fall in love with her and ruin\nher educational qualities\u2014that\u2019s why. We don\u2019t no more than get a she\nteacher, until all the saddle-slickers around here quit working and\nprevents her from teaching the young idea how to shoot straight.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis here miss, who writes me from Great Falls, orates that she\u2019s the\ngoods,\u201d states \u201cDoughgod\u201d Smith. \u201cShe slings a good hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet her sling it\u2014in Great Falls,\u201d says Mike. \u201cAs chairman of the Board\nof Trustees of Paradise, I hereby open and above board objects to\nanything but a male teacher.\u201d\n\n\u201cI places my bet with yours,\u201d says J. B. Whittaker, owner of the Cross J\noutfit. \u201cWomen has always been the bane of my existence, and in a case\nlike this I opens my mouth like a wolf and openly howls for a man.\n_Lignum vit\u00e6._\u201d\n\n\u201c_E pluribus unum_,\u201d says Mike, and the session is over.\n\nMe and \u201cChuck\u201d Warner sets there on the saloon steps and listens to\nthose words of wisdom. Chuck wiggles his ears a lot at the decision and\nwatches them adjourn for a drink.\n\n\u201cConfounded old coots,\u201d says Chuck sad-like. \u201cOnly one of them is\nmarried, and he ain\u2019t got no kids. I don\u2019t blame Mike for harboring\nresentment against the weaker sex\u2014after seeing his wife, but them other\ntwo loveless lunatics ain\u2019t got no cause to boycott calico for\neducational purposes. I figured on a woman teacher, Henry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and me both,\u201d says I. \u201cAccording to fiction, a puncher has to fall\nin love with a school-teacher.\u201d\n\nOld Doughgod Smith wanders out and comes over to us, wiping his\nmustache.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re three lovely old joy-killers, Doughgod,\u201d says Chuck. \u201cRegular\nold race-suiciders.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, now, Chuck,\u201d says Doughgod, setting down with us. \u201cDon\u2019t blame me.\nIt\u2019s two against one, and I\u2019m the one. Also, I\u2019m sort of up against it.\nI didn\u2019t know them snake-huntin\u2019 cohorts of mine were so bitter against\nwomen\u2014honest to gosh! That Miss\u2014\u201d Doughgod scratched his head\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t\nknow her name right now\u2014well, she sounds on paper like a regular\nteacher; so I told her to come and take the job. She\u2019s on her way now,\nand I don\u2019t know how to head her off.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo ways out,\u201d states Chuck. \u201cEither shoot J. B. or Mike and get a\nwarmhearted man in their place, or meet the train and send her back from\nwhence she comes.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeet her at the train? Me? Not Doughgod Smith! Not me, Chuck. I got\nrheumatism in the vocal cords when it comes to denying a female\nanything. I can stand without hitching long enough to meet a lady in a\ncrowd, but I don\u2019t walk right up and speak to one. Reckon I\u2019ll have to\npay her way back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could meet her if I was properly coaxed,\u201d observes Chuck. \u201cMe\u2014I ain\u2019t\nscared of no female woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you do that, Chuck?\u201d asks Doughgod anxious-like. \u201cHonestly, would\nyou?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. Give me the money for the ticket.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy grab, Chuck, you and me are friends for life. Here\u2019s twenty. I don\u2019t\nknow what the ticket costs, but I ain\u2019t asking questions. If she asks\nfor me, you tell her\u2014what\u2019ll you tell her?\u201d\n\n\u201cI never rehearse, Doughgod. I\u2019ll tell her something\u2014you gamble on\nthat.\u201d\n\nDoughgod wanders away, hugging himself, so me and Chuck buys a drink. We\nmeets \u201cMuley\u201d Bowles and \u201cTelescope\u201d Tolliver, and Chuck tells them\nabout the trustee meeting.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a danged shame,\u201d states Telescope. \u201cThis here country is pining\nfor the touch of a woman\u2019s gentle hand. Now, when she shows up, we got\nto tell her to pilgrim along. Just \u2019cause them two old, dried-up\nspecimens don\u2019t want women, it ain\u2019t no reason why we don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cDogs in a manger,\u201d says Muley, shaking his fat face until it wobbles.\nMuley had had about enough cheer for a fat man, and he ain\u2019t none too\nsecure on his feet. \u201cAs the poet would shay:\n\n    \u201cDrink to me only with thy eyes,\n      Oh, women, lovely women,\n    If I hadn\u2019t washed las\u2019 Shummer\n      I\u2019d like to go in schwimmin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cMuley, you\u2019re making light of a dark subject,\u201d chides Telescope.\n\u201cThis is a case of two old pelicans trying to cut the sentiment out of\nthe cow business, and we\u2019ve got to frustrate it. _Sabe?_\u201d\n\n\u201cShentiment?\u201d asks Muley serious-like. \u201cThis is my shentiments:\n\n    \u201cLove is a fleeting flower\n      That fleeted away from me,\n    Like a tumble-weed in a cyclone\n      Adrift on a Wintry sea.\n    Where are the loves of yesterday\n      That made my heart so light?\n    Gone like the howl of a coyote\n      That was howled at the moon last night.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s shentiment,\u201d says Muley. \u201cDeep from the heart. Who\u2019s going to\nthe dance at the Triangle tonight, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cDances is secondary to the main issue,\u201d says Telescope judicial-like,\n\u201cand poetry is incidental. We must contemplate deep and act as our\nbetter natures dictates.\u201d\n\nMuley Bowles is a self-made poet. Something inside that\ntwo-hundred-and-forty-pound carcass seems to move him to rime, and\nnothing can stop him. He\u2019s so heavy in a saddle that all of his broncs\nare bowed in the legs and run their shoes over awful.\n\nTelescope Tolliver came from down in the moonshine belt, and he\u2019s got\nsome strange and awful ideas of what constitutes a code of honor. He\u2019s\nso long in the legs that a bronc has to pitch twice at the same time to\nget him high enough to throw.\n\nChuck Warner is a Roman-nosed puncher, with the shortest legs on record\nand the trusting eyes of a bird-dog. According to all we can find out,\nChuck is a titled person. Of course, being an ordinary puncher, he don\u2019t\nwish to have folks know him as anything but just plain Chuck, but the\ntitle remains just the same\u2014Ananias the Second. I won\u2019t go so far as to\nsay that he can\u2019t tell the truth, but I will insist that he won\u2019t.\n\nMe\u2014I\u2019m Henry Clay Peck. I play the banjo cheerfully, take my baths on\nthe same day of every month and do what I\u2019m told. I can\u2019t blame nor\ncredit anybody but me for what I am.\n\nThe four of us punches cows for the Cross J, draw down forty a month and\nspend our leisure time trying to figure out how old J. B. Whittaker ever\ngot so much talent together in one bunch. We sure make a pretty good\nquartette for singing. We\u2019ve got one tenor and three other voices.\n\nWe hives up around Mike Pelly\u2019s bar that day and sings songs until Chuck\nsuggests that we better go down to the depot and see if the lady comes\nin. We\u2019ve got several trains a day; so it\u2019s up to us to see \u2019em all. The\ntrain ain\u2019t in yet; so we sings a few more songs. After a while the\ntrain comes in\u2014but no lady. Muley starts an argument with the conductor\nover it, but the conductor is a big, mean-looking person; we takes Muley\naway from him and sets him on a truck.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe train pulls out, and on the far side of the track stands a female.\nShe must have got off on the wrong side. She sure is fair to look upon,\nand Muley falls off the truck when he tries to take off his hat to her.\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d says Telescope, bowing and trying to take off the hat he\u2019s\nalready got in his hand, \u201cma\u2019am, the town is on this side.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d says she and then stares at us.\n\n    \u201cHer hair was gug-golden, and her lips was blue.\n    Her eyes was sweeter than the morning dew.\n    Her nose was like sea-shells, and her ears was pug\u2014\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019d like to assassinate Mike Pelly and J. B. Whittaker\u2014honest to\ngosh!\u201d says Muley, still on his hands and knees with his hat down over\none eye.\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am, it sure pains me to tell you this, but\u2014you\u2019ve got to go right\nback where you came from,\u201d says Chuck sad-like. \u201cHonestly.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo back?\u201d she gasps, and Chuck nods.\n\n\u201cYes\u2019m. You\u2019ve got to. Not on our account, ma\u2019am, but there seems to be\na sentiment against women. One of them says that women is the banes of\nhis existence, and the other says that\u2014aw, Telescope, you talk a little.\nI ain\u2019t going to stand here all day arguing with a perfect lady.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou heard him say it, ma\u2019am,\u201d agrees Telescope. \u201cThey\u2019re against a\nwoman. Now if you was a\u2014wait a minute! Gosh, lady, I got a hy-iu scheme.\nWe\u2019ll slip one over on the women-haters.\u201d\n\nTelescope grabs her by the arm, and the lady acts mystified-like.\n\n\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t understand,\u201d says she. \u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThis ain\u2019t no time or place to settle it,\u201d says Telescope. \u201cCome on,\neverybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right, ma\u2019am,\u201d says Muley, taking hold of her other arm.\n\u201cYou can trust Telescope\u2014as long as me and Chuck and Hen are along to\nprotect you. Where we going, Telescope?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll leave our broncs here and take the buckboard,\u201d says Telescope.\n\u201cThe old man is in a poker game by this time, and he won\u2019t need it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked you in a lady-like manner to tell me where we\u2019re going,\u201d says\nMuley. \u201cIs it a secret, Telescope?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain when we get there, Muley,\u201d he replies.\n\nThe four of us helps the lady into the buckboard, while them two roan\nbroncs dance a jig against the hitching-rack. The lady acts scared\nstiff, but that\u2019s natural under these circumstances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll drive,\u201d proclaims Telescope. \u201cThe lady sets in the middle, and\nMuley on the end. You other two can set in the back or get your broncs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour statement shows lack of consideration and fine thought,\u201d states\nChuck. \u201cI am going to ride on that seat. Sabe?\u201d\n\n\u201cNominations being in order, I\u2019ll speak a word or two in favor of old\nman Peck\u2019s son, Henry,\u201d says I. \u201cI don\u2019t care a whoop who drives, but\nI\u2019ll say right here that Henry Clay Peck is the third member of the\nseat-riders.\u201d\n\nAll of which makes it hard to arrive at a peaceful solution. Telescope\u2019s\nidea of a proper argument is to slam his sombrero on the ground and talk\nat the top of his voice. Naturally this aggravates said touchy team,\nwith the result that they casts domestication to the four winds and\nwhales off up the street with the fair one all alone on the seat and the\nlines dragging.\n\n\u201cWho in \u2014\u2014 untied them animals?\u201d yelps Muley.\n\n\u201cWhich ain\u2019t nothing but a question,\u201d replies Chuck, throwing down the\ntwo halters in disgust. \u201cCome on and let\u2019s get our broncs. She\u2019s due to\nget killed in about a minute.\u201d\n\nThe four of us lopes down the street to where our animals are tied, and\nif you asks me I\u2019d say that we went out of town fast. In fact we showed\nso much animation that Bill McFee, our progressive sheriff, took a shot\nat us, just on general principles.\n\nWe strung off up the road, me and Telescope fighting for first place\nwith Chuck running a close second and Muley bringing up the rear, eating\nalkali dust like a machine.\n\nWe hammers along for about two miles, when all to once we sees a cloud\nof dust ahead of us. Said cloud is sliding toward the grade down to the\nWind River crossing, and we all sighs to think what that runaway team\nwill do to that lady when they hit the boulders of Wind River. We shoves\non more steam and unhooks our ropes. Me and Telescope ain\u2019t got room for\ntwo loops the way we\u2019re running; so I slips back into second place.\n\nDown that grade we sails and into the willows just short of the ford.\nChuck and Muley have picked up a little, which hampers our show to do\nany fancy rope stunts, and them four animals runs almost a dead heat to\nwhere the road breaks straight down to the river. Which only gives us a\npitch of about thirty feet to the water\u2019s edge.\n\nI don\u2019t just know what happened then. We\u2019re going too fast to even take\na second look. I seen a buckboard, with the horses standing up in the\nwater, and then the next thing I know I\u2019m spinning over and over in the\nair. Above me is Muley, with his legs spread out like sails, and he\u2019s\nflopping his arms like he was trying to fly higher. I remember that I\nlaughed at Muley trying to imitate a bird, and just then I took my first\nbath short of Saturday evening.\n\nI landed in the river flat on my stummick and found out that a feller\ndon\u2019t have to learn to swim in order to do it. All the wind is out of my\ncarcass, but I sure done some fancy crawling until I lands on a sandbar\ndown the river and pumps some more wind into my system. In my pocket is\na bottle of \u201cTrack Annihilator,\u201d and I immediate and soon finds the need\nof a stimulant. I hauls it out, removes the stopper and squints through\nit at the sun.\n\n\u201cBlam!\u201d That bottle fades out of my hand, and all I\u2019ve got left is the\ncork.\n\nThe next bullet cuts a rosette off my chaps; so I slides into the water\nlike an alligator and proceeds to waller off downstream. I may die from\ndrowning\u2014I say may, \u2019cause I\u2019m taking a chance\u2014but it\u2019s a cinch that if\nI stay on that sand-bar any longer that _hombre_ with the rifle is going\nto improve with practise, which will spoil all of Henry Peck\u2019s future\nambitions.\n\nI hears a few more shots before I grabs a willer and hauls myself out\ninto the high grass. I\u2019m too tired to hunt for information; so I\nrusticates there until I hears somebody tramping grass and grunting:\n\n\u201cGol dang \u2019em! Gol dang \u2019em! Hope I drownded the whole mess of pups.\nHope I leaded up all that didn\u2019t drown. Half-witted horse-wranglers. No\nbrains! Race right into me and my load of dynamite. Too bad it didn\u2019t\nbust and blow \u2019em all to \u2014\u2014! Team runs away and leaves me on the wrong\nside. Gol dang\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWick Smith, throw up your hands,\u201d says I sweet-like.\n\nHe drops his gun and grabs atmosphere.\n\n\u201cToss that rifle into the brush,\u201d says I, and he reaches down like a\nnice little feller and obeys.\n\nI takes it and throws it further into the woods, and then I walks out to\nhim.\n\n\u201cHello, Wick,\u201d says I. \u201cHow\u2019s things in Piperock?\u201d\n\n\u201cTolable, Hen. How\u2019s the Cross J these nice days? Where\u2019s your gun?\u201d\n\n\u201cLost it in the river,\u201d says I.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe looks at each other for a while, and then he says\u2014\n\n\u201cWhat was your hurry a while ago, Hen?\u201d\n\n\u201cRunaway. Strange lady comes in on the train, and we\u2019re going to take\nher to\u2014I wonder where we was going to take her, Wick?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy gosh, didn\u2019t you have no place picked out?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe Telescope did. Well, she got in the buckboard, and the team runs\naway, and we thought you was it, and\u2014well, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cStrange lady came in on the train?\u201d he gasps. \u201cWhat did she look like?\u201d\n\n\u201cMorn in Spring,\u201d says I. \u201cShe had hair and eyes and a mouth and\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat lovely dove!\u201d he whoops. \u201cThat\u2019s her to a flea\u2019s flicker.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy wife\u2019s sister, Amelia. My \u2014\u2014! She ain\u2019t due yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cCame today,\u201d says I. \u201cCame today, and\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWent away,\u201d says a sad voice, and there stands Muley, Telescope and\nChuck.\n\nThey sure are something for to see. They look like they had been made of\nmud and hadn\u2019t dried out yet.\n\n\u201cIt was fate,\u201d says Muley, digging the ooze out of his eye.\n\n    \u201cShe braved the dangers of the iron trail,\n    Maybe she rode on boats that have a sail,\n      And all was well,\n    Until she came to peaceful Paradise,\n    Where everybody leaves who has the price.\n      Fate sure is\u2014!!\u201d\n\n\u201cAmen,\u201d says Telescope. \u201cYou handled that well, Muley.\u201d\n\n\u201cGents,\u201d says I, \u201cdon\u2019t be sacrilegious. You are now standing in the\npresence of the bereaved brother-in-law. The lost lady was his wife\u2019s\nsister.\u201d\n\n\u201cShucks!\u201d exclaims Telescope, trying to remove the hat he ain\u2019t got.\n\n\u201cThis is painful, Wick. Where\u2019s your outfit?\u201d\n\n\u201cHoly henhawks!\u201d wails Wick. \u201cYou fellers bucked over it and through it,\net cettery, and left me setting on the bank on a busted box of dynamite,\nwith nothing left but my rifle\u2014and Hen threw that in the jungle. The\nrest, if there\u2019s anything left, is likely on its way to Piperock.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re on foot,\u201d wails Chuck. \u201cMy tobacco is wet, and there ain\u2019t a\ndrink in the crowd, and\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Shakespeare\u2019s dead, and Longfellow\u2019s dead, and I don\u2019t feel very\ngood myself,\u201d finishes Muley.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ve got to find that runaway,\u201d says I. \u201cThey\u2019re likely at the\nranch\u2014unless they\u2019re strung out along the road.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy wife will give me particular thunder,\u201d wails Wick. \u201cShe ain\u2019t\nexpecting me to bring back no deceased sister-in-law\u2014darn it all! I\nreckon we better toddle over to the ranch, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know a short-cut,\u201d offers Chuck. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk back over that ridge and\nswing on to the road on the other side of Ghost Gulch. That\u2019s only about\nfour miles.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd still four miles from the ranch,\u201d groans Muley. \u201cAnd us wearing\nhigh-heeled boots.\u201d\n\n\u201cYe gods, I wish I had that rifle,\u201d grunts Wick. \u201cI\u2019d kill four punchers\nright here.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeath ain\u2019t nothing,\u201d groans Muley, limping along.\n\n    \u201cHell hath no fury like a blistered heel,\n    That busts and then begins to peel.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s dark when we got to the Cross J ranch, and we limps in like five\nlost souls. There ain\u2019t a trace of that buckboard or the lady. There\nain\u2019t nobody around the place.\n\n\u201cMy gosh!\u201d wails Wick. \u201cSomething has got to be did. She was my wife\u2019s\nsister.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy use the past tense?\u201d complains Muley. \u201cMaybe she still is your\nwife\u2019s sister. We\u2019ll be square with her, Wick, and consider her alive\nuntil she disappoints us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know where the old man keeps his spirits,\u201d states Chuck, fussing with\na window. \u201cYou fellers feel spirit voices calling?\u201d\n\nWe did. Chuck found the cache, and we has quite a seance.\n\n\u201cWalking is too slow,\u201d complains Wick. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go faster than that,\nboys. Ain\u2019t there a danged thing around here I can ride upon?\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t you _hombres_ got enough _sabe_ in your system to know that out\nthere somewhere in the stilly night is a remnant of my wife\u2019s family,\ncrying for succor?\u201d\n\n\u201cMight he not ride, Solomon?\u201d asks Chuck, wiggling his ears at Muley.\n\n\u201cBeyond question he may,\u201d nods Muley. \u201cHang a hull on Solomon, Chuck,\nand let the sucker arrive at his wife\u2019s sister\u2019s side without delay.\u201d\n\n\u201cSolomon is which?\u201d asks Wick.\n\n\u201cSolomon,\u201d says Telescope, \u201cis a mule. A white mule\u2014in color. He ain\u2019t\nno speed-demon, but he sure can save shoe leather, Wick.\u201d\n\n\u201cI accepts the nomination,\u201d says Wick and takes another drink.\n\nChuck comes back in about ten minutes, leading that long, hungry-looking\nmule. We helps Wick into the saddle, wishes him a pleasant journey, and\nthen Chuck hits Solomon across the rump with a strap. Solomon bucks\nstiff-legged down to the gate, and then we hear him pounding off down\nthe hard road.\n\nChuck stands there looking at what he\u2019s got in his hand, and then:\n\n\u201cGee gosh! When I took the rope off that mule, I took the bridle, too.\nPoor Wickie ain\u2019t got no rudder for his old white ship.\u201d\n\n\u201cCancel any help from Smiths,\u201d says Telescope. \u201cSolomon, with all his\nwives, never was half as crazy as that namesake of his. Let us all have\nanother inoculation of paralysis microbes and start out being merciful.\nWe\u2019ve got to find that lady.\u201d\n\nThen four fools started out in the dark. We sang a song at the gate and\nthen piked off down the road, arm in arm. As usual Muley gets so\nsentimental that he has to compose a little; so we has to stop while he\nrecites:\n\n    \u201cAn angel came to cow-land and stole my heart away.\n    She was a shrinking flower that came to me today.\n    My heart is like a sinker, \u2019cause I love her well,\n    But I\u2019m \u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nMuley breaks down and begins to sob:\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t finish it! My rimer gets drownded in tears.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me assist you,\u201d begs Chuck. \u201cHow\u2019s thish?\n\n    \u201cMy heart is like a sinker, \u2019cause I love her well,\n    But I\u2019m \u2019fraid thish lovely angel has got busted all to \u2014\u2014!\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t that shome finish?\u201d\n\n\u201cGrewshome ghoul,\u201d shudders Telescope.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fac\u2019,\u201d argues Chuck. \u201cBet anybody forty dollars she never made\nthe turn out of Sillman Gulch. Betcha she turned over there. Ain\u2019t\nnobody got any shporting blood? Even money that she didn\u2019t make that\nturn\u2014thirty to forty that they hung up before they got that far. Any\ntakers? Bet ten \u2019gainst forty that\u2014that Solomon has killed Wick Smith\nbefore thish.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019re getting into pleasant conversation,\u201d says Telescope. \u201cThat\u2019s\nwhat I call looking at the doughnut instead of the hole.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know where we went. We took turns carrying that demijohn. We\nwanted something to pour between unresisting lips, like you read about,\nbut we can\u2019t seem to find no unresisting lips.\n\nI know we all fell into Wind River, which is three miles from Paradise.\nMuley hung up on a sand-bar and sobbed himself to sleep. Telescope\ncrawled back on the bank and implored us to go ahead and save the women\nand children and leave him to die like a man. I heard Chuck singing\u2014\n\n\u201cLocked in a stable with a s-h-e-e-p,\nI lay me dow-w-w-wn in hay to sle-e-e-e-ep.\u201d\n\nMe, I got tangled up in the limbs of a fallen tree and went to sleep\nwith my feet over a limb.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201cWell!\u201d says a voice, and I woke up. There is \u201cRicky\u201d Henderson setting\non his bronc, looking at us. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you fellers? I\nhelped rope your broncs yesterday when they came back to town, and\nthey\u2019re tied to the rack in front of the Eureka\u2014or were last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe matter with us?\u201d asks Muley mean-like. \u201cThat\u2019s our business, Ricky.\nWho told you to tie up our broncs in Paradise? Next time you leave \u2019em\nalone and let \u2019em come home. _Sabe?_\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d snorts Ricky, riding away. \u201cWith their tails behind them, eh?\nAll right, _Little Bo-Peep_.\u201d\n\n\u201c_Bo-Peep_, eh?\u201d whispers Chuck, wiggling his ears. \u201cMamma mine!\u201d\n\n\u201cOur broncs are in Paradise,\u201d mentions Telescope. \u201cThree miles more,\ncomrades.\u201d We hobbles along on sore feet for a while, and then Chuck\nsays\u2014\n\n\u201cSay, Telescope, where was you aiming to take the lady? And what was\nyour big scheme?\u201d\n\n\u201cOut to the ranch, Chuck. I figured on dressing her up in our clothes\nand hiring her out as a male teacher. _Sabe?_ Figured we\u2019d slip one over\non them three old pelicans, and then they\u2019d have to keep her\u2014or never\nhear the last of it. It was a good idea. If that little runt of a Warner\nhad sense enough to leave the team tied,\u201d adds Telescope a little later.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to throw your hat on the ground and whoop like a\ndrunken Indian,\u201d reproves Muley. \u201cYou\u2019re to blame, Telescope.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d says I. \u201cYou and Telescope has to argue like a pair of fools.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you wasn\u2019t in the argument, was you?\u201d sneers Telescope. \u201cYou three\ngrocery-store punchers make me tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cut out that runt talk,\u201d says Chuck. \u201cI\u2019d rather be small and\nshapely than to be so tall that the buzzards roost in my hair. You think\nyou\u2019re a lady-killer, Telescope, and this is the one time when you\nlikely qualify. Maybe the jury will adjudge so.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and he swore aloud before her,\u201d says I. \u201cHe talked around her like\nshe was his wife.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe smiled at me,\u201d grins Chuck sweetlike, and Muley snorts:\n\n\u201cSmiled! Laughed, Chuck. Do you think for a minute that a person like\nher would smile at critters like you three? That woman\u2019s got a soul.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere do you qualify with soulful women, Muley?\u201d asks Telescope. \u201cSince\nwhen has the fair sex designated a hunk of lard as the target for\nsoulful glances? Of course, if you designated a runt like Chuck or a\nsquint-faced _hombre_ like Hen Peck\u2014\u201d\n\nLove has cut a breach in the Four Disgraces. Cupid has poisoned his\narrows, and we forgets friendship ties. Maybe it was an accident\u2014maybe\nnot, but anyway we ain\u2019t gone far when Muley steps on Chuck\u2019s ankle.\nChuck yowls like a tom-cat and slaps Muley right in the face. Telescope\ngrabs Chuck by the neck, and I kicks Telescope\u2019s feet out from under\nhim.\n\nThat took team work, if anybody asks you. I reckon the buzzards were the\nonly ones who enjoyed it. Somebody hit me between the eyes, and I\nup-ended in a mesquite bush, where I found a snag, about two feet long\nand as big as my wrist. So I waded right back into the conflict. Then\nsomebody handed me an encore in the same spot, and I got used as a\nwelcome mat. Then somebody laid down on top of me and pushed me into the\ndirt, but I got out, found an unoccupied boot and hit that somebody\nseveral times over the head. My eyes don\u2019t permit me to judge distance,\nbut I felt out my target and made no misses.\n\nThen I laid down, too, and went to sleep.\n\nAfter a while I woke up and sat there, looking around. I can see\nTelescope\u2019s legs sticking up over the top of a mesquite, and Chuck is\nsetting in the shade of the same bush, crooning to himself while he\ntries to light a cigaret on the sole of his boot. Muley is beside me,\nsnoring sweetly, and setting there beside us on a dilapidated white mule\nis Wick Smith.\n\nWick sure looks like he had been someplace and met something awful. The\nmule\u2019s head is hanging down weary-like, while Wick slouches in the\nsaddle, with his jaw hanging down about three inches.\n\nHe weaves in the saddle and his mustache acts nervous-like.\n\n\u201cFind anything?\u201d he asks like the weak croak of a frog.\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d I whispers back at him.\n\nHe nods, slaps the mule side of its head and turns into the road.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still looking,\u201d he whispers, and I says:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine. So am I, but I can\u2019t see nothing, Wick.\u201d\n\nAnd when I laid down beside Muley, I saw Wick and Solomon fade off up\nthe road toward Paradise. After a while we all got up and sort of stood\naround. Chuck yawned and looked at his watch-chain. Pretty soon\nTelescope cleared his throat\u2014\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m all through\u2014with all of you\u2014the whole danged bunch!\u201d says he\nhesitating-like and starts limping toward town.\n\n\u201cMe\u2014me, too,\u201d says Muley and follers Telescope.\n\nChuck looks at me mean-like and says\u2014\u201cMe too.\u201d\n\nHe pilgrims after Muley.\n\nThen the whole danged bunch limped in behind Chuck.\n\nI passed Chuck in a few minutes, and then I made Muley eat my dust.\nTelescope has contracted a limp, which causes him to weave across the\nroad a lot and makes it hard for me to pass him. But I made it. Nobody\nsaid anything to me, and, when folks don\u2019t speak to me as I go past, I\nget snobby, too.\n\nI hobbles into Mike Pelly\u2019s saloon and sets down. There ain\u2019t nobody\nthere except the bartender. Pretty soon Telescope weaves in and sets\ndown in the other corner. Chuck points straight for the pool-table, and\nthen Muley stumbles in. He looks to have lost twenty pounds, and his\nfeet have swelled until he\u2019s had to slit his boots.\n\n\u201cYou fellers quitting the Cross J?\u201d asks the bartender. \u201cThought maybe\nyou was,\u201d he continues when we don\u2019t answer, \u201c\u2019cause I seen your boss\nleading four horses behind the wagon when he left last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast night?\u201d asks Muley. \u201cWagon?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh. Borrowed Mike\u2019s team and wagon.\u201d\n\nI rolled a smoke, and the match made as much noise as a six-shooter. We\nnever thought to look in the corral last night.\n\nThen Wick Smith comes in. He buys himself a drink, and then he wipes his\nmustache. He looks at us sad-like and shakes his head.\n\n\u201cBeen to the post-office,\u201d says he. \u201cShe ain\u2019t coming until this\nafternoon.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014\u2014!\u201d grunts Telescope. \u201cThat team must \u2019a\u2019 taken her a long ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t have nun-nothing on that\u2014that mum-mule,\u201d grunts Wick, and then\nhe weaves out of the door.\n\nWick has been drinking.\n\n\u201cWhat seems to be the trouble with you fellers?\u201d asked the bartender.\n\u201cYou look like you\u2019d been to battle and got run over by a cannon.\u201d\n\nWe ignores the inquiry, and pretty soon Telescope says\u2014\n\n\u201cBeen anything startling going on here lately?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014\u2014!\u201d snorts the bartender. \u201cStartling! Nothing ever happens in\nParadise.\u201d And he goes on wiping glasses.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d says Muley soft-like. \u201cI love a quiet village.\u201d\n\nWe got up, one at a time, and wandered outside. I\u2019m the last one out.\nThere ain\u2019t nothing to do but walk back. We might chip in and hire a rig\nat the livery stable, but under the circumstances\u2014well, we don\u2019t feel\nlike riding so close together, and rigs cost money.\n\nI seen Muley setting on the sidewalk, pulling off his boots, and over on\nthe watering-trough, one on each end, sets Telescope and Chuck like a\ncouple of snow-birds, soaking their sore feet. Muley joins them, and\nthen Henry Peck goes over and immerses his corns. We ain\u2019t been there\nlong when here comes Doughgod Smith, galloping up the street.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s got any more dirty work to have done, he can do it himself,\u201d\nproclaims Chuck. \u201cI\u2019m through deceiving women.\u201d\n\nDoughgod races up to us and hops up and down around us.\n\n\u201cGet down to the depot, Chuck!\u201d he yelps. \u201cShe\u2019s there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d asks Chuck.\n\n\u201cThe lady\u2014dog-gone you! The one I gave you the money for. _Sabe?_ Point\nher homeward, boys, and make it sudden,\u201d and Doughgod lopes on up the\nstreet.\n\nHe sure is skittish around calico.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to stand together,\u201d observes Chuck, pulling on his boots.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to. Divided we fall.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder them circumstances I waves a flag of truce,\u201d says Telescope. \u201cI\nmay kill a friend later on, but it never can be said that a Tolliver\never went back on a friend in need.\u201d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe all plods down the street, with Muley carrying his boots, and, just\nas we got to the depot, a freight-train whistles. The lady is there.\nShe\u2019s setting there on a low truck in the shade, doing fancy work, and\nshe\u2019s the same lady.\n\n\u201cMy \u2014\u2014!\u201d snorts Telescope. \u201cShe must be made of cast-iron. Ain\u2019t bunged\nup a bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I ain\u2019t only got seven dollars of that money left,\u201d wails Chuck. \u201cI\nmust \u2019a\u2019 lost it.\u201d\n\nWe all digs down and manages to collect enough to make up the original\ntwenty, and, just as the freight rolls in, we walks over to the lady.\nChuck leans over and drops the money in her lap, and her face turns\nwhite as flour when she looks up at us.\n\n\u201cGet right into the caboose,\u201d orders Chuck. \u201cDog-gone it, ma\u2019am, we\u2019re\nsorry as \u2014\u2014, but we ain\u2019t got no time to argue. There\u2019s the money, and\nhere\u2019s your train. Get on like a nice little girl, and you can write to\nDoughgod for further information. _Sabe?_\u201d\n\nI sure felt sorry for her. She sort of gasps and slides off that truck,\nbut I reckon our looks were enough. She allows herself to walk right\ninto the train, and away she goes off up the track toward Silver Bend.\n\nDoughgod has sneaked up and saw the whole thing, and he sure is glad. We\nall sets down on the platform, and all to once we feels that it has been\na year since we had anything to eat. Doughgod offers to take us to a\nrestaurant, but we ain\u2019t presentable; so he offers to bring us a ton of\ncrackers and cheese and sardines. We accepts and cheers Doughgod as he\nhurries up-town. There\u2019s another train due in an hour; so we sets down\nthere in the shade to eat. We seen the depot-agent looking at us through\nthe window. He\u2019s a new man there; so we don\u2019t blame him for looking with\nsuspicion upon us. We sure filled our skin with food, and then the train\ncomes rambling in.\n\nThe usual bunch of folks hops off to stretch their legs, and all to once\nwe hears a voice behind us\u2014\n\n\u201cCan you tell me where I can find Mr. Smith?\u201d\n\nWe all turns, and there stands a tall, skinny female, with a nose like\nthe beak of a hawk and a lot of mustard-colored hair. I glances around\nand saw Doughgod galloping off up the street like a scared coyote.\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d says Telescope, \u201cI can\u2019t say. He may stop in Paradise, but I\u2019d\nfavor Canada.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay!\u201d yelps a heavy voice behind us, and we all turns. It is the new\nstation agent, and in his hands is one of them sawed-off shotguns which\nare furnished by express companies, and he\u2019s got it cocked. \u201cI want to\nknow,\u201d says he, \u201cif you are the four whelps who kidnapped my wife and\nput her in that rig yesterday. The team ran away, turned the corner and\nran into a fence, and that\u2019s all that saved her life. I\u2019m asking a\nquestion?\u201d\n\n\u201cYesterday?\u201d asks Telescope foolish-like. \u201cYesterday?\u201d\n\n\u201cI said it!\u201d he yelps. \u201cAnd an hour or so ago the same four whelps\nforced her to climb on a freight-train. She just wired me from Silver\nBend. I\u2019m still asking questions, gents.\u201d\n\nI seen that skinny lady edging away from us, and I seen her hop on to\nthe last step as the train starts, and she ducks inside like a rabbit.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d says Telescope. \u201cYou got that right? The team ran around the\ncorner and into a fence and stopped. Is that right?\u201d\n\n\u201cKe-rect!\u201d he snaps. \u201cI\u2019ve sworn out John Doe warrants for the men who\ndid it, and the sheriff is investigating right now. All I want is to\nfind \u2019em and I\u2019ll fill \u2019em so full of \u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n_Blam!_\n\nTelescope hooked one of his feet behind that feller\u2019s legs, and yanked\nso quick and hard that the station agent got an upside-down view of his\nown place of business.\n\nMan, we moved. A buckshot cut a groove in my boot heel, and Muley got\none across his hip pocket before we got out of range, which was fast\nwork with a gun.\n\nWe dusts straight for town, when we almost runs over Wick Smith. He\u2019s\ncoming along, taking up most of the road, and me and him both tries to\nturn the same way. I picked myself up as quick as possible, and started\non, when I heard Wick say\u2014\n\n\u201cTrain in yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d I yells back and tries to catch up with the rest of my bunch,\nwho seem to have met somebody and then went on.\n\nThat somebody was Doughgod. I finds him setting in the middle of the\nroad with the brim of his hat down around his neck and a fool look on\nhis face. As I come up, he holds up the letter he\u2019s hanging on to and he\nsays to me:\n\n\u201cHuh-Henry, she ain\u2019t\u2014ain\u2019t coming here. She\u2019s gug-got a bub-better job.\nShe ain\u2019t coming here, Henry.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe shows a lot of sense,\u201d says I, and I lopes on.\n\nI seen Telescope and Chuck and Muley gallop off the street and cut\nacross the hills; so I puts on more speed and catches them.\n\n\u201cBill McFee is up there,\u201d pants Telescope when we slows to a walk.\n\u201cDud-don\u2019t forget we\u2019re four John Does.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t nothing to the word I\u2019d use,\u201d groans Muley.\n\nWell, we eventually got home. We collapses on the steps of the\nbunk-house, and I don\u2019t care if I never move again. Pretty soon\nTelescope glances up at the door and grunts.\n\nHalf-way up the door a piece of white paper has been pasted; so we\ncreaks to a standing position and peruses same:\n\n    I put your horses in the livery-stable last night, and, if\n    you don\u2019t want a big bill against them, you better get them\n    right away.\n                                              (signed) J. B. W.\n\n\u201c\u2014\u2014!\u201d snorts Muley. \u201cHe\u2014he just led them down to the stable, and that\nfool bartender thought he was taking them home.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we been walking away from them all this time,\u201d groans Chuck.\n\n\u201cHere comes Mike Pelly and the old man now,\u201d says Telescope.\n\nWe watches old J. B. Whittaker and Mike Pelly walking down from the\nranch-house, talking serious-like. The old man turns at the barn, but\nMike comes on down to us.\n\n\u201cHowdy,\u201d says Mike. \u201cHow\u2019s everything, boys?\u201d\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t able to kick,\u201d says Telescope. \u201cHow\u2019s it with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cTolable. See Doughgod in town?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was there the last we seen of him,\u201d admits Muley. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cGoing down to see him. Dang this trustee business, anyway. Nothing but\ntrouble. Me and the old man have decided to accept that teacher that\nwrote to Doughgod, even if she is a female. Never mix into the\nschool-teacher business, boys. She\u2019s \u2014\u2014!\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is,\u201d agrees Muley, and we all nods.\n\nTHE END",
