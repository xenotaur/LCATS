    "body": "To stay alive five years on Mars, you have to have a nose for trouble.\nYou have to be able to smell it before it happens, to catch the\noderiferous tang of it in the dry wind blowing across the red deserts,\nto sense it in the shifting shadows of the sunset. Otherwise you may\nnot stay alive on Mars for five months let alone five years. Or for\nfive days, if you happen to be in the wrong place.\n\nBoyd Larkin had lived seven years on Mars, in the wrongest of all wrong\nplaces on the red planet, the city of Sudal. No other earth trader ever\neven ventured here. In view of the peculiarity of the Martian customs,\nfew traders found it wise to attempt to operate on Mars at all.\n\nThe City of Sudal was noted for several reasons. In a way, it was the\nholy city of Mars. Here also were to be found a few lingering relics\nof the vast scientific achievement this race had once known and had\nforgotten in the hard struggle for life across the centuries. Here\nalso was a ruler by the name of Malovar, who, within the framework of\nMartian law and custom, was an utter despot. The reputation of Malovar\nalone was sufficient to keep most traders away from Sudal.\n\nThis, in itself, was enough to bring Boyd Larkin here.\n\nHe stood in the door of this store--it had once been the wing of a\ntemple--just before the hour of sunset. A vague uneasiness was in him,\na presentiment of trouble. His eyes went over the city, searching for\nthe stimulus that had aroused the feeling in him. The peaked roofs of\nthe buildings of the city glinted peacefully in the rays of the setting\nsun. Peaked roofs here on this world of no-rain always struck him as\nodd but he knew these roofs were relics of the far-gone centuries when\nrain had fallen plentifully on Mars.\n\nBeyond the city lay the desert with its fretwork of canals and its\npathetic patches of green growth, pathetic because where once grain had\ngrown as far as the eye could reach now only a few patches were under\ncultivation. It was not the failure of the soil or of the water that\nmade the desert bare. This soil would still grow lush vegetation. But\nthe grains, though lush, would be worthless, incapable of supporting\nlife. The minerals had been virtually exhausted from the top-soil of\nMars.\n\nWithout minerals, the grain did not support life.\n\nThe breeze that came in from the red deserts was soft and peaceful,\nwith no trace of danger in it, no howl of a devil dog from the desert's\nbrim, no chirrrr of a winged horde of locusts coming to devour the\ncrops.\n\nWhere, then, was the source of his feeling of danger?\n\nHad Malovar begun to doubt him? Was the Martian ruler considering what\naction he might take at the next time of the testing? At the thought,\na slight shudder passed over the tall trader as if the desert wind had\nsuddenly become tinged with a trace of bitter chill. No, that could\nhardly be the source of the trouble he sensed. He was no telepath, he\ncould not read Martian minds, nor they his.\n\nWhat then was the source of the trouble that he sensed?\n\n\n\nFrom inside the store a soft voice called out, \"_Send motan_.\"\n\nLarkin went inside. The Martian had entered by the side door. He was\ntall and slender, with a big chest and a skin the color of old copper.\nHis features were finely moulded, the face of a dreaming esthetic. In\none hand he held a jewel, one of the Martian opals, uncut. At a glance\nLarkin knew that this opal was worth approximately seventy dollars\ndelivered on Earth.\n\nIn the other hand the Martian held a list which he was turning in\nnervous, uncertain fingers.\n\n\"Yes, Seekin?\" Larkin said.\n\nThe Martian smiled. A little uncertainly he pushed the list across the\ncounter.\n\n\"I do not need all of these for me and mine, but the ground is prepared\nand ready, and if I have these minerals I will be able to grow more\nthan I need. Then there will be something over for someone else to use\nin the time of scarcity.\" His voice was as soft as a breeze, there was\nno hint of a demand in it. But there was a pleading in the eyes that\nlooked at the human.\n\nLarkin took the list. Rapidly translating the Martian script, he saw\nthat Seekin wanted approximately five grams of powdered cobalt, copper,\nboron, manganese, with traces of iron, zinc, and calcium. Phosphorus\nalso was included and a smattering of trace elements.\n\nThe trader went quickly to the bins and filled the order, tossing the\ncorrect amount of the powdered elements into the agitator for mixing.\nHe spun the crank of the agitator and the machine hummed softly. The\npowdered minerals poured from the spout. He bagged the mixture. His\npracticed eye told him that the cost of these minerals, delivered here\non Mars, was approximately two hundred dollars.\n\nThe Martian's eyes became fixed longingly on the little bag when\nLarkin laid it on the counter. There was an eagerness in the eyes that\nwas almost as strong as the eagerness for life itself. But there was\nuncertainty too. He fumbled with the opal.\n\n\"This is all we have,\" he said.\n\nLarkin grinned. \"It's odd, isn't it, how things achieve a balance?\nThose minerals come to just exactly the price of this jewel.\"\n\nA glow lit the Martian's face. \"Do you mean it?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Take the minerals, give me the opal. It is a fair trade.\"\n\nOn Seekin's face appeared a glow that was like the light of the rising\nsun. He clutched the bag of minerals to his chest.\n\n\"Thank you, my friend. This will be remembered.\" Turning, he went out\nthe door. On the verbal level his thanks had not been profuse, but the\nglow on his face had exhibited another kind of thanks, to Larkin a much\nmore important kind.\n\nLarkin felt some of the inner glow within him that had appeared on the\nMartian's face. The minerals he had practically given away would be\nspread on some little patch of irrigated land, spread with all the care\nand saving thought that alert minds and hands educated for centuries\nin extracting the last trace of food value from unwilling soil could\nbestow. The grain would be eaten by Seekin and his family. They would\nfeel a new throb of life within them as mineral-hungry tissues took up\nand utilized the earth elements down to the last molecule. And there\nwould be something left over for somebody else in the time of need.\nLarkin especially liked that.\n\nA warm glow flooding through him, Larkin went again to the door of his\nstore. He lit his pipe and stood there contentedly smoking, a tall,\nangular Earthman who had wandered from his native planet for a reason\nthat he considered sufficient. Except for two articles for scientific\njournals, dealing with the problem of supplying minerals to the\ntop-soil of Mars and the vast need for such mineral fertilizer, he had\nhad no contact with Earth in seven years. Nor did he anticipate that he\nwould ever again see Earth, or anyone from that planet, except possibly\na rare, far-wandering trader like himself. There was peace in Boyd\nLarkin.\n\nBut there was trouble in the air.\n\nHis ears caught the far-off drum-fire of rockets.\n\nHe felt his pulse pick up. A ship was coming.\n\nInstantly he knew the source of his feeling of coming trouble. He had\nheard the sound of those far-off rockets long before he was aware of\nit as sub-liminal ranges of sound penetrated to his inner being. That\nsound had been the stimulus for the feeling of trouble that had arisen\nin him.\n\nA ship, men, humans, were coming.\n\nWherever humans were, there was trouble.\n\n\nII\n\n\"The fools!\" he thought. \"What do they want here?\"\n\nHe watched the ship land in a fury of splashing jets, just outside\nthe city, but he did not go to it. He was not in a mood to see his\nfellowmen. They would come to him in the morning, searching out the\nlone human in this Martian city. He did not think he would wait for\nthem. In the morning he would take a trip to some outlying settlement\nwhere the need of minerals was great: For a few days he would trade\nthere.\n\nHe was sitting in his chair outside his store deciding which of the\nvarious Martian villages he would visit in the morning when he saw the\nthree humans approaching through the twilight. Astonished, he rose to\nhis feet. They hadn't waited for the morning. They had come to him now,\nbefore night.\n\nThree burly spacemen, big enough and obviously willing to cut a throat\nor rape a woman, were coming toward him. No Martian guided them but\nthey seemed to know where they were going. They came directly toward\nhim. As they approached, he saw they carried _Kell_ guns, the vicious\nlittle weapons that spurted a stream of explosive bullets like water\nout of a hose. The sight of the guns startled him. He had forgotten\nthat such weapons existed, or that men used them.\n\nHe heard the voices of the men as they approached. Harsh, brutal\nvoices, the language all rough consonants. He had forgotten too, the\nsound of men. The language spoken by the Martians was all soft vowel\nsounds, gentle words breathed so easily that they seemed to brush only\nthe surface of the aural mechanism and hardly seemed ever to reach the\nmind beneath.\n\n\"There he is!\" The men saw him now, came straight toward him.\n\nHe rose to his feet. He would greet them politely, like a gentleman, if\nit killed him.\n\n\"You--Are you Larkin?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" He advanced with hand outstretched. \"Gentlemen, it is certainly\na privilege to see you. Won't you come in?\" He gestured toward the\ntemple wing that served as his store.\n\n\"Naw!\" There was no effort at answering politeness in the harsh voice.\n\"We come to get you. Come on with us.\"\n\n\"Come to get me?\"\n\n\"Yeah. The boss wants you. Mr. Docker.\"\n\n\"I don't believe I know a Mr. Docker. What does he want?\"\n\n\"To see you. Come along.\"\n\nLarkin found himself marching ahead of the three men toward the ship\nthat lay at the edge of the city. No Martian made a move to interfere.\nNo Martians were on the streets, none were visible. He did not doubt\nthat they watched him from the windows of the houses along the streets,\nbut they made no effort to inquire what was happening.\n\nWhat could they do, even if they had wanted to help him? To the best of\nhis knowledge, the only weapons they had were knives.\n\nWhat were knives against _Kell_ guns? Why should the Martians help him,\nan alien among them?\n\nDocker was a big man with a red face that perpetually showed the red\ncoloration of hidden anger. He had full, thick lips, the avid lips of\na greedy man. Whatever these lips tasted or drank, they wanted more of\nit, all of it. His eyes confirmed his lips. Here was a man who wanted\nthe world with an iron fence around it. Or better still, the solar\nsystem, with a big sign saying--KEEP OUT. THIS IS ALL MINE. He looked\nup as Larkin entered the cabin, glanced up at the men with him.\n\n\"He's clean,\" one of the men said.\n\n\"Okay, you can leave. Set down, Larkin.\" Docker's eyes went back to the\npapers on his desk.\n\nLarkin sat down. There seemed nothing else to do. He was very much\naware that his situation here was ticklish. Docker finished with the\npapers. He looked up. His eyes were bold, confident, and arrogant.\n\n\"Larkin, we're taking over the distribution of all minerals used for\nsoil enrichment on Mars.\"\n\n\n\nLarkin felt shock rise in him. He held it under control. His hands\nclenched into fists. \"By whose authority?\" His voice had acid in it.\n\n\"Whose authority?\" For an instant, Docker looked astonished. \"Why, Roy\nsaid--\" He caught himself. The astonishment turned into swift anger\nwhich showed as a tide of red creeping over his face. \"By our own\nauthority!\" His fist pounded on the desk, emphasizing the words.\n\n\"You do not have the sanction of the Martian government?\"\n\n\"What government is there on Mars?\" Docker demanded. \"The whole cursed\nplanet is split into a hundred different tribes that do not even know\nthe meaning of the word government.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" Larkin said.\n\nDocker spoke the truth, or part of it. There was no central government\non the red planet. Yet there was a central authority, of a sort. It\ncentered here in this city of Sudal, in the person of a despot named\nMalovar. Larkin did not pretend to understand the system but he knew\nthat far-ranging desert tribes followed Malovar's orders, at least to a\ndegree. Malovar's orders and Martian law and custom.\n\n\"What about Earth Government?\" Larkin questioned.\n\n\"Earth Government can go to hell!\" Docker answered. \"They have no\ncontrol over Mars. Why do you bring up such questions? I told you we\nwere taking over distribution of mineral fertilizers on this planet.\nThat's enough authority for you or for anybody else.\" Again the fist\nbanged on the desk.\n\nLarkin looked at the fist and was silent. The fist impressed him not\nat all but the situation did impress him. There was a question he\nwanted to ask but he was afraid he knew the answer without asking. He\nstarted to ask it, then hastily changed his mind.\n\n\"How do you know the Martians will buy from you?\"\n\n\"They buy from you, don't they? They've been buying from you for seven\nyears. They'll buy from us.\" He sounded very sure of himself, like a\nman who has a plan all made, a plan which he knows will work.\n\n\"Ah!\" Larkin sighed and was silent. True, the Martians had bought from\nhim, but there was a price which he had to pay for doing business\nhere, a price which Docker and his men might not relish paying. Larkin\ntried to imagine the consequences of their refusal to pay that price.\nHis imagination failed him. These Martians had forgotten a great many\nthings that humans had not yet learned. Larkin thought again of the\nquestion he wanted to ask, and again put off asking it.\n\n\"What prices do you intend to charge for your minerals?\"\n\nA grin that had relish in it showed on Docker's face. \"Our prices will\nbe fair. Of course, we expect to show a profit.\"\n\n\"Suppose the Martians can't pay your prices?\"\n\n\"To hell with that!\" Docker snorted. \"We're not transporting minerals\nall the way to Mars just to give them away. They'll pay all right.\nThey'll pay or they won't eat.\" He smacked his lips with obvious\nrelish. A situation in which people paid his prices or did not eat\npleased him.\n\nLarkin was silent. There was still the question he did not want to ask.\n\"You seem to have everything worked out to the last detail,\" he said.\n\n\"We have,\" Docker nodded agreement. \"Roy's a genius along those lines.\"\nAgain he caught himself as if the name had slipped out unintentionally.\n\nRoy? A thought came into Larkin's mind. He put it out. What he was\nthinking was impossible. He writhed inwardly. He was going to have to\nask the question he had tried to avoid.\n\n\"Why have you come to me?\"\n\nA smile appeared on Docker's face. \"Because you are the only trader\nwho has been able to win the complete confidence of the Martians.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Larkin said.\n\n\"So we have a use for you,\" Docker continued. \"You tell us how you have\nwon the confidence of these Martians and we'll cut you in on the deal.\nWe'll see that you are adequately paid. Any price within reason.\"\n\n\"Ah.\" Larkin was again silent. \"But I thought you indicated that the\nMartians will have no choice except to deal with you. Under those\ncircumstances why do you need me?\"\n\nDocker's smile lost none of its easy sureness. \"We prefer to do things\nthe easy way, so nobody gets hurt. Since you are here and know the\nground, it'd make sense for you to throw in with us.\"\n\n\"So I am the easy way?\" Larkin said.\n\n\"Well--\"\n\n\"You go to hell!\" Larkin said. He got to his feet, turned toward the\ndoor. Surprisingly, no effort was made to stop him.\n\n\"We'll see you in the morning,\" Docker said.\n\n\"It won't do you any good.\"\n\nLarkin walked out of the ship. No effort was made to stop him. He moved\nslowly across the desert toward the city.\n\nThere was nothing about this situation that he liked. Least of all he\nliked the fact that Docker seemed to know a lot about him. How could\nthat be? No one on Earth remembered him or knew about him. At the\nthought, sadness came up in him, replacing the smouldering anger. It\nwould be nice to have someone to stand beside him now, someone fighting\nshoulder to shoulder with him. The word Roy came into his mind again.\nHe quickly put it aside. Let dead dreams lie. But Docker had used the\nword twice. What did Docker mean? Larkin shrugged off this line of\nthinking.\n\nThere was almost no question in his mind as to what he was going to\ndo. If he took Docker's offer, and tried to trim the Martians, he knew\nbeyond the shadow of a doubt what old Malovar would do. The temper of\nthe Martian ruler--chieftain, high priest--he had all these titles and\nmore--was certain. Malovar brooked no cheating of his people.\n\nBut, of course, Malovar did not know about this offer of Docker's.\nLarkin was glad of that. He did not want Malovar even to guess what was\nin the minds of the men in the ship.\n\nEntering his store, Larkin started in surprise. Seated in a soft chair\nat the back was Malovar.\n\n\n\nThe Martian ruler was old, how old only Malovar and the gods of Mars\nknew. His skin was wrinkled, his face was a bleak mask that looked as\nif it had never formed a smile. Except for the curious metal staff\nthat he held across his lap, the Martian ruler wore no insignia of his\noffice. His clothing was a simple tunic like the togas of the ancient\nRomans. He was smoking a thin reed pipe, the only luxury he ever\npermitted himself, and the rich flavor of Martian tobacco was heavy in\nthe room. With him was one attendant, an elder of the tribe.\n\nLarkin bowed. \"I am honored, sire.\" It was not too unusual for Malovar\nto pay him a visit. The ruler went from the greatest mansion to the\nhumblest hut at will.\n\n\"Come sit, my friend.\" The Martian's voice was as gentle as the passing\nof a soft breeze but Larkin knew that this breeze would turn into a\ntornado in an instant. He sat down. Silently, Malovar extended his\ntobacco pouch. Silently Larkin took it.\n\n\"A ship landed this afternoon, my friend,\" Malovar said.\n\n\"Yes,\" Larkin agreed.\n\n\"You have been to talk to your countrymen.\"\n\nIt was a simple statement. Larkin writhed inwardly but attempted no\ndenial. \"How did you know?\"\n\n\"I have ways of knowing. Tell me, are they scientists, or explorers, or\ntraders? Or some other breed of that curious creature--the human being?\"\n\n\"They--\" Larkin hesitated. How much did he dare reveal? This Martian\nhad most penetrating and discerning eyes. \"They hope to trade.\"\n\n\"Ah.\" Malovar was quiet for a long time. \"My friend, you have been here\nand I have known you for seven years. During this time I have been\npleased to call you friend.\"\n\n\"I have been honored.\" Larkin spoke. \"They have been most enjoyable\nyears.\" Why was this feeling of sweat suddenly appearing on his body?\nThe room was cool almost to the point of being chilly now that the\nnight had come.\n\n\"You have helped many of us. Seekin was in here this afternoon--\"\n\n\"It was nothing,\" Larkin said, embarrassed.\n\n\"Many times you have done this deed which you call _nothing_,\" Malovar\ncontinued. \"I just wanted you to know that I was aware of some of these\ninstances.\"\n\n\"It is good of you to mention them,\" Larkin said. He did not like this\nsparring, this talk that seemed to go nowhere.\n\n\"I wanted you to know that at the next time of the testing these deeds\nwhich you call _nothing_ will be taken into consideration,\" Malovar\nsaid.\n\nSweat broke out all over Boyd Larkin.\n\n\"They will be given due weight, but they will _not_ sway the scales in\nyour favor against other possible deeds.\"\n\nOnly a strong effort of will kept Larkin from shaking. \"Sire--\"\n\nMalovar rose. He lingered in the doorway. \"I have come to regard you as\na friend, the only human I have ever known whom I was willing to call\nby that name. I should regret very much losing my human friend.\"\n\n\"Sire--\"\n\n\"But my regret will not stay my hand at the time of the testing!\"\n\nHis lone elder following him, Malovar was gone into the Martian night.\n\n\nIII\n\nMalovar left behind him an exceedingly perturbed human. Larkin knew\nthe ruler well enough to know that Malovar meant what he said. His\nhand would not be stayed at the time of the testing. And that time\nmight be any time when the temple bells sounded a summons to the vast,\nalmost-ruined amphitheater which was used for the tests. Again a chill\npassed through Larkin. He had been through the testing before, many\ntimes, but there had never been any doubt in his mind that he would win\nthrough it. Now there was doubt.\n\nHe had seen what happened to those who failed. In him the chill grew to\na shudder. These Martians had the damnedest customs.\n\nFaced with this choice, there could be only one answer.\n\nDocker and his cut-throat crew could really go to hell. Better defy\nDocker than Malovar. There was no way in which the humans could enforce\ntheir demands on him.\n\nOr was there? So far as he knew there were no weapons in this city\nstrong enough to resist the power of the single ship that lay outside.\nThe Martians obeyed Malovar because of custom, and not because the\nruler had any way to enforce his orders. Larkin could see no way by\nwhich Malovar could force Docker to go through the testing. A single\ntrader could be forced. But a ship full of men armed with _Kell_\nguns--No!\n\nLarkin spent most of the night going over what he would say to Docker's\nmen when they arrived in the morning.\n\nThey came early. Three were the same. Standing in the door of his\nstore, Larkin stared at the fourth man with growing horror in his\nheart. The sight of that fourth man hit him harder than Malovar's grim\nwarning about the time of the testing.\n\nThe fourth man moved ahead of the others, came toward him. In this\nminute it seemed to Boyd Larkin that he had aged years. Something that\nhe had left back on Earth, left there because he could neither control\nit nor face it, had come unbidden to him here on Mars. In this moment,\nhe wildly regretted that he had not fled to some outlying village\nduring the hours of darkness.\n\nIt was too late to flee now. He had to face the consequences.\n\nHe forced himself to move forward, to hold out his hand. Inside of him,\noperating on an unconscious level, a kind of wild gladness came up. He\nforced it back down. This was no time for errant emotions.\n\n\"Roy!\"\n\nThis man was his son.\n\nRoy Larkin took his father's hand indifferently. \"Hi,\" he said, and\ndropped the hand.\n\nWith horribly mixed memories flooding through him, Boyd Larkin stared\nat this man who was his son. He remembered this man in his play-pen,\na curly headed tot fiercely demanding his toys. He remembered him in\nhigh school, the kid who was going to be the best athlete in school,\nor else. The hard driving, I-don't-give-a-damn-what-happens-to-you,\nI'll-get-mine attitude had been obvious in him even then.\n\nIt was an attitude which the best specialists in the functioning of the\nemotions had been unable to control. Roy Larkin seemed to have been\nborn with the grim intention of grabbing everything that was handy, and\nto hell with everybody else. When his father, knowing the inevitable\noutcome of such an attitude, had been driven finally to interfere, the\nexplosion had been catastrophic.\n\nLarkin's ears still burned with the memory of what he had been called.\n\"A stupid fool. An incompetent jackass. An idiot without enough sense\nto come in out of the rain!\" There had been other words too. At the end\nof the argument, the youth had slugged his father. This had happened\nwhen he was twenty.\n\nBoyd Larkin had come to Mars then, a grim, bitter, disappointed and\nfrustrated man fleeing from all memories. He had hoped never to hear of\nhis son again.\n\nBut his son had come to him here on Mars.\n\n\"I'm taking over,\" Roy Larkin said. \"The fact that you're my old man\nwon't get you anything.\"\n\n\"_You're_ taking over? I thought Docker--\"\n\n\"Docker works for me.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You heard me.\" The voice was blunt. It stated a fact. \"I listened\nwhile he talked to you last night. I wanted to get an estimate of the\nsituation. Of course, we'll take care of you. We'll leave you in charge\nof the station here.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"There are no 'buts' about it. I have made a study of the need for\nagricultural minerals on Mars. If handled properly, the thing is\nricher than forty mints. I intend to see that it is handled properly.\nYou could have made a fortune here, if you'd a had good sense.\" An\naccusatory note crept into the voice as if the failure to make a\nfortune when one was to be had was an act that Roy Larkin could neither\nunderstand nor forgive.\n\n\n\nBoyd Larkin felt a burning inside of him, replacing the gladness he had\nfelt when first he saw this man. There had been no change. There was no\npossibility of change. \"You seem to know quite a lot about Mars.\"\n\n\"I do,\" Roy Larkin grinned. \"I've made a study of the subject. A couple\nof articles you wrote gave me the idea that the right man could clean\nup here. Of course, I didn't think that _you_ were the man--\"\n\n\"There may be difficulties,\" the father said.\n\n\"We expect them. So what?\" Roy Larkin gestured at the men with him,\na gesture which also included the _Kell_ guns they carried and which\nincluded the _Kell_ gun held in the elbow of his left arm. \"If these\ndon't do the job, we've got bigger things on the ship.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Boyd Larkin said. He was regaining some of his lost composure\nbut he was acquiring no liking for the situation.\n\n\"We're not looking for trouble but we came prepared for it. I thought\nyou would be a big enough fool to tell us to go to hell if you had the\nchance. Well, you've got the chance but you either throw in with us or\nwe throw you out--bodily.\" His manner said he was prepared to back up\nhis words.\n\nLarkin was silent. They could remove him bodily from this place. He\ncould not resist four men. \"But what if the Martians refuse to trade\nwith you when you take over?\" he said quietly.\n\n\"How can they refuse? They've got to have minerals. Without them, they\nstarve.\"\n\n\"They might choose to starve,\" Boyd Larkin said.\n\n\"What?\" the younger man gasped. \"But that's silly. That's crazy. You\ndon't know what the hell you're talking about. You're trying to pull a\nfast one.\"\n\n\"They're a strange people,\" Boyd Larkin said, ignoring his son's\noutburst. \"Sometimes they seem to do crazy things though I have usually\nfound that back of their craziness is a vein of such hard common sense\nthat it is bewildering to us humans.\"\n\nRoy Larkin was a little uncertain. \"They've been dealing with you.\nThey'll deal with us.\"\n\n\"That does not necessarily follow. What you do not understand is that\nthey have a certain test, and that I have passed it.\"\n\n\"A test? Well, what is it. If you can pass it so can we. You haven't\ngot anything that we haven't got.\"\n\nAn involuntary shudder passed over Larkin. \"Perhaps. But this test\nisn't exactly easy.\" A sound came to his ears. Over the city of Sudal\nwas flooding the sound of temple bells. The shudder came over him\nagain, grew stronger.\n\nHis son's eyes were sharp on him. \"What the hell are you shaking about?\"\n\n\"The temple bells--\"\n\n\"So what?\"\n\n\"That's the call to the testing. It's an emergency call. It means us.\"\n\nHe saw unease appear momentarily on the face of his son and the men\nwith him, then he saw it shrugged away. \"If we have to pass some kind\nof a test to do business with these fools, all right. We'll pass it.\"\n\n\"I hope,\" Boyd Larkin whispered. Already the elders had put in their\nappearance and were coming toward them. They carried with them the long\nmetal rods like the one Malovar carried and which were the sign of\ntheir office.\n\n\"They come to take us to the place of the testing,\" Larkin said. He\nstraightened his shoulders. The Martian elders bowed politely and\nmotioned him to precede them.\n\nNeither his son nor the men with him liked the idea. They did not know\nwhat was going to happen. They would have preferred to go elsewhere.\nBut Larkin was going and they could hardly let him out-face them.\nBesides, they had _Kell_ guns. So what danger could they meet that they\ncould not overcome?\n\n\nIV\n\nThe place of the testing was a huge coliseum that had been centuries\nold when the human race was still in the barbaric stage of its\ndevelopment. It had been designed to hold tens of thousands of\nspectators and once unquestionably it had held them but the whole\npopulation of Sudal and the surrounding territory would now hardly fill\nthe lower tiers. Looking out at the encroaching desert, where pathetic\nlittle patches of greenery tried to stem the tide of encroaching\ndesolation, it was easy to see why this stadium could no longer be\nfilled.\n\nAlready the Martians were beginning to trickle into the lower seats\nwhen the humans arrived at the top of the vast bowl.\n\n\"What the hell goes on here?\" Roy Larkin kept demanding. \"I don't like\nthis.\"\n\n\"You've got your _Kell_ guns, what are you afraid of?\" the trader\nasked.\n\n\"I'm not afraid,\" the younger man angrily answered. \"Except for the\nmetal rods the old gooks are carrying, they're not armed. Hell, we're\nnot afraid of them. It's just that I don't know what the hell is\nsupposed to take place.\"\n\n\"You'll find out,\" Boyd Larkin answered.\n\nIn the center of the vast amphitheater was a raised stone altar.\nIn this dry atmosphere, the red stains on it never weathered away.\nDirectly behind the altar was a chair. Malovar was already taking his\nplace in this chair. Leading up to the altar, a double line of elders\nwas forming. Other elders had already made a large circle of living\nstatues around their ruler.\n\nWith only the slightest perceptible hesitancy in his stride, Larkin\nwent down the steps of this coliseum. Very vaguely he wondered how\nmany Martians had traveled this path in the centuries gone. There must\nhave been uncounted millions of them. He, personally, had seen most\nof the inhabitants of Sudal pass this way at one time or another. He\nhad passed this way himself upon his arrival here. He had not fully\nunderstood what could happen then, he had been hurt to the bottom of\nhis soul, and he had not cared much what did happen. He had passed the\ntest, then and later. But now--\n\nMalovar's warning of the night before was still ringing in his ears.\n\"My regret will not stay my hand at the time of the testing.\"\n\n\"Where the hell are we supposed to go?\" Roy Larkin questioned, as they\nreached the bottom of the steps. \"This looks like a Roman circus, or\nsomething.\"\n\n\"Follow me,\" the trader answered. His step was firm as he trod between\nthe lines of the elders. He knew them, all of them, he had sold\nminerals to most of them. Now their faces were as immobile as stone.\nThey seemed never to have seen him. At this moment, he was a stranger\namong them, an alien they did not seem to know.\n\nHe walked up in front of the altar, stood facing Malovar.\n\nSitting in the big throne chair behind the altar, the face of the\nMartian ruler was a mask far more bleak than the faces of his elders.\nNow in this moment he wore the regalia of his office, the carved\njeweled crown, the diadem of gems suspended from his throat. Either\nthe crown or the diadem would have been worth a fortune back on Earth.\nBehind him, Larkin heard the humans catch their breath at the sight of\nthese jewels. He knew what they were thinking: a few quick bursts from\nthe _Kell_ guns and this fortune would be theirs.\n\n\"Are you prepared for the test?\" Malovar's eyes centered on Larkin.\n\n\"I am prepared, Sire. But why am I being tested now?\"\n\n\"Any individual may be tested at any time the welfare of the people in\nmy opinion requires such testing.\" The Martian words seemed almost to\nbe part of a ritual.\n\n\"And on what will your decision be reached?\"\n\n\"Again, the welfare of my people,\" Malovar answered.\n\n\"I mean--what deeds of mine will be judged here?\"\n\nMalovar's face grew bleaker still. \"Perhaps nothing you have done but\nsomething you may do.\"\n\n\"But you cannot test me now for something I have not yet done, you\ncannot read the future!\" the human protested.\n\n\"Perhaps by testing you now I may guide the future,\" Malovar answered.\n\"But--enough of talk. Kneel!\"\n\nLarkin knew he had no further choice. He went down on his knees before\nthe altar. Out of the corner of his eyes, he saw one of the elders take\nMalovar's staff from him, hand him instead the sword. Larkin knew that\nthe blade of that sword was razor sharp. Driven with only moderate\nforce it would cut flesh and bone instantly.\n\nHe closed his eyes.\n\nHe felt himself grabbed by the shoulder and jerked backward. He faced\nthe raging, frightened eyes of his son. \"What the hell's going on here?\"\n\n\"This is the test,\" he explained. \"You have to go through this test\nbefore you can sell minerals to the people of Sudal.\"\n\n\"But what's he going to do?\" The younger man gestured toward Malovar\nwho stood erect.\n\n\"I do not know. His action is his choice.\"\n\n\"But he is acting and you are acting as if he may chop off your head!\"\n\n\"That is exactly what he may do, if he so chooses.\"\n\n\"But that's crazy!\" Roy Larkin exploded.\n\n\"To us, yes. To the Martians, no. This is the way they have of testing\nthe loyalty of individuals to the group. At the time of the annual\ntesting all the inhabitants of this city pass one by one before\nMalovar.\"\n\n\"And he cuts off the heads of the ones he don't like!\" Horror sounded\nin Roy Larkin's voice.\n\n\"I do not think his liking or not liking has anything to do with it,\"\nthe trader explained. \"He is working for the good of his whole people,\nnot his personal good. And he cuts off heads if he chooses. I have seen\nhim lop off a dozen heads in a single hour.\"\n\nSweat oozed out of Larkin as the memory came back to him.\n\n\"But, damn it, we don't have to go through with this test. We're not\nMartians--\"\n\n\"We propose to do business with them. This is the way they test our\nfitness to do business with them. They make the rules here.\"\n\n\n\nA snarl was in his son's voice. \"But we don't have to obey them!\"\n\n\"What is this discussion?\" Malovar spoke softly, in Martian.\n\n\"I am explaining to my son what is happening here,\" Larkin said.\n\n\"Your son?\" Something very close to surprise showed on the wrinkled,\nbleak face. \"Is _this_ man _your_ son?\"\n\n\"He is,\" Larkin answered. There was no apology and no attempt at\nexplanation in his voice. He stated a fact, and if it damned him,\nthen it damned him. The interpretation of that fact he left up to the\nMartian ruler.\n\nMalovar seemed not to find that interpretation difficult. For an\ninstant, the eyes of the Martian went to the younger Larkin, weighing\nand testing him. Malovar's face grew bleak indeed as if his eyes saw\nthe surface and what was under the surface and found none of it to his\nliking. Then his eyes came back to the trader.\n\n\"We will continue with the testing,\" he said.\n\n\"I am ready,\" Larkin answered, moving toward the altar.\n\n\"Hey, wait a minute,\" his son said, seizing his arm.\n\nLarkin shrugged off the grip. \"You idiot!\" Anger blazed in his voice.\n\"Don't you know what you face here? This test must be accepted, or you\nwill never do business on Mars.\"\n\n\"All right, you old fool!\" His son's voice was shrill with anger too,\nthough not the same kind of anger. \"Go on and get your stupid head\nchopped off and see if I care.\"\n\n\"I did not expect you to care,\" Larkin answered. He laid his head on\nthe altar.\n\nMalovar lifted the long sword.\n\nOver the coliseum the assembled Martians seemed to catch their\ncollective breath and then to stop breathing. The silence became thick,\nheavy, like a pall of gray mist. In that voiceless instant it seemed to\nBoyd Larkin that time itself was standing still. What would Malovar do?\nLarkin did not know, and had never known, the facts on which the ruler\nbased his decision to strike or not to strike.\n\nWhat did knowing, or not knowing, matter now, in the moment that might\nsee the end of his life?\n\nThe hushed silence was broken by a single sharp cry. Larkin opened his\neyes. He saw Malovar catch the movement of the sword. He turned his\nhead in the direction from which the cry had come.\n\nDown between the lines of the elders a single Martian was running.\n\nSeekin!\n\nSeekin came to a halt before the altar, bowed before Malovar. His gaze\ndid not go to the human rising to his feet. He looked at Malovar.\n\n\"I claim the privilege of taking his place, Sire,\" Seekin said.\n\"According to the ancient law of the testing, I take his place.\"\n\nLarkin blinked startled eyes. A glow came up in him. He was hardly\naware of it. He had never seen this thing happen before, he did not\nknow it could happen, he did not know that Martian minds worked this\nway. Surprise was in him.\n\nSurprise seemed to be in Malovar too. Over the coliseum the silence\nseemed to become heavier as if thousands of Martians were each holding\nhis breath in wonder and in awe.\n\nAfter the first flash of surprise, Malovar's face became bleak again.\n\n\"Do you accept the human's fate as your fate, whatever my decision may\nbe?\" the Martian ruler questioned.\n\nUnder his brown, Seekin showed a creeping tide of white. He knew what\nwas meant, knew it intimately and well. But his nod was resolute and\nundaunted.\n\n\"Yesterday he gave me valuable minerals in exchange for a valueless\njewel. Thus he gave life to me and to my family. And he gave me more\nthan was needed, so that something more might be grown--for someone\nelse. Thus he has fulfilled the highest tenet of our law. Sire--\"\nSeekin bowed low. \"--whatever it may be, I accept his fate.\"\n\nThe words were simply spoken. The soft slurred sounds hardly disturbed\nthe quiet air. But they carried a wealth of meaning.\n\nOver the vast throng a sigh arose as if the watching Martians were\nseeing a miracle. For the first time since he had been on Mars, Boyd\nLarkin saw a real smile appear on the bleak and bitter face of Malovar.\nThe smile was almost a benediction.\n\nThe benediction of that moment was shattered by a furious blast of\nsound.\n\n_Brrrrp, brrrrp, brrrrp!_\n\nThe sound of _Kell_ guns in operation.\n\n\nV\n\nThe elder standing beside Malovar clutched his throat and collapsed,\nblood spurting from a hole in his throat. Larkin jerked startled eyes\ntoward the source of the sound.\n\nOn top of the coliseum was a group of men from the ship. Docker led\nthem. They were firing _Kell_ guns indiscriminately into the Martian\ncrowd.\n\nThe brrrrrp-brrrrrp was an almost continuous blast of sound. Following\nthe throb of the guns was the violence of the explosions of the\nstriking missiles. The whole vast arena throbbed to the fury of the\nsound.\n\n\"No!\" Larkin screamed.\n\nThis was a slaughter of helpless innocents. The Martians were\nunprotected, incapable of defending themselves. And they had done\nnothing wrong.\n\n\"Stop!\" The voice of Malovar was like thunder rolling through the\narena. He spoke in Martian but there was no mistaking his meaning.\nHe dropped the sword, took back his metal rod that was part of the\nregalia of his office, held it erect. In that moment he was like a\ntribal god ordering the lightning and the thunder.\n\nThe answer, coming from above, was a slug that whistled within inches\nof Malovar's head and exploded behind him.\n\n\"For the last time, stop!\"\n\nAnother slug howled downward.\n\nThen Malovar acted.\n\nLarkin was not quite certain what happened but out from the tip of\nthe metal staff that Malovar held seemed to flash a bolt of blinding\nradiance. It was not a thunderbolt, it was not electrical, it was\nprobably no force known to Earth scientists.\n\nLooking upward, Larkin expected to see the flashing radiance blast\nthrough the group of humans like a smashing thunderbolt, searing and\ndestroying them, leaving in its wake chunks of charred and writhing\nflesh that had once been men.\n\nNo such thing happened. The blinding radiance swirled around the men.\nIt formed a coating around each of them. In a split second each of them\nwas encased in a plastic cocoon that looked like ice, a covering that\nheld them helpless. They still retained their guns but the plastic\nforce covered the guns too. The guns were silent. Either they could not\nfire into the plastic coat or the men who still grasped them could not\nmove their fingers to press the triggers.\n\nLike statues frozen in motion, the group stood at the top of the\ncoliseum, on the highest row of seats of that vast circling arena.\n\nA cry of rage sounded near Larkin, then was suddenly stilled.\n\nAt the sound of the cry near him, Larkin turned, saw that his son and\nthe men with him were likewise encased in plastic envelopes. He saw\nthat his son's eyes were bulging from terror, his throat pulsating from\nthe effort of trying to scream. But no sound was coming forth.\n\nRadiance pouring from the tip of the staff of one of the elders had\naccomplished this effect.\n\nThe torture of that moment must have been a terrible thing for Roy\nLarkin. To be held helpless by a force that stilled all motion, to\nwant to scream but be unable to hear the blessed sound of your own\nvoice, to see the consequences of your own acts coming home upon your\nhead--this was torture.\n\nMalovar and his elders had not been helpless. They had retained in the\nmetal rods some of the vast forgotten science of old Mars, a science\nthat they rarely used, and rarely needed to use.\n\nMalovar, his face still like thunder, was standing erect and was\ndirecting what was to happen next.\n\n\n\nThere were screams in the coliseum, of wounded and dying Martians, and\na vast stir as Martian friends ran to help those who had been injured,\nand a babble of voices rising in anger. The elders were moving. Some of\nthem were attending to the stricken. Others were directing the removal\nof Docker and the men with him from the top of the coliseum. Docker and\nhis men were being carried down by Martians. They seemed incapable of\nmovement of their own.\n\nThe whole group was brought before Malovar.\n\nThe face of the Martian was the face of a tribal god, furious with\nanger. He made a motion with his hand toward Docker. The Martians\ncarrying the man laid him face down on the altar. Malovar handed his\nmetal staff to the nearest elder, took up the sword.\n\nThere was no mistaking the intention of the Martian. He lifted the\nsword, brought it down. Just before it reached its target, the plastic\nenvelope collapsed as the elder holding the staff made a slight shift\nwith it.\n\nDocker had time to start a scream. The scream ended. A head skittered\nacross the stone, blood spurted.\n\nA moan went over the watching throng.\n\nLarkin watched, appalled. He had seen Martian heads roll here before\nbut somehow this scene was different. Here was Martian justice, swift,\nsure, and final.\n\nMalovar made another motion with his hand. The nearest human, one of\nthe men with Docker, was lifted, carried to the altar. Larkin saw the\nman's muscles writhe against the plastic force envelope that held him,\nwrithe unavailingly.\n\nSunlight glinted on the red blade of the sword as it came down.\n\nAgain a moan went up from the audience.\n\nMalovar pointed with his sword--at Roy Larkin. Elders seized the man,\nlifted him, carried him to the altar.\n\nThe sword came up.\n\n\"NO!\" A single burst of involuntary sound came from the lips of the\ntrader. He leaped forward. \"NO!\"\n\nMalovar held the sword, looked at him. The Martian looked a little sad.\n\n\"I know he is your son, my friend, but he came here to cheat and to\nrob. Men under his direction have killed.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"The laws of my people are explicit,\" Malovar continued. \"Nor will I\nstay my hand for the sake of friendship at the time of the testing.\"\n\n\"But--\" Larkin still protested. Here was a bond, an obligation, that\nwent beyond friendship.\n\n\"I am sorry,\" Malovar said gently. His tone of voice and the expression\non his face said he was really sorry. But they also said he had no\nintention of holding his hand from striking.\n\nBoyd Larkin moved again. He was not quite sure why he did what he did\nand he was utterly unsure as to what the result would be, but in the\nface of the rising sword, he lifted his son from the altar.\n\n\"I claim your law,\" he said. \"I take his place.\" He laid himself on the\naltar.\n\nOver the watching throng there was silence. He sensed rather than saw\nMalovar lift the sword.\n\nThere was a stir of feet near him. A gentle voice spoke.\n\n\"I also claim the law. I have bought his life once this day. You may\nnot strike him.\"\n\nSeekin's voice. Soft and gentle but very firm and very sure. Seekin\nstood before the altar with uplifted hand. He spoke to Malovar but his\neyes were on Larkin.\n\n\"You are free, my friend. Our laws protect you now and will protect you\nuntil the next time of the testing.\"\n\nMalovar lowered the sword blade. \"Our laws hold,\" he said. \"I may not\naccept you as a substitute sacrifice. Nor may I accept Seekin. Nor may\nI accept him--\" his eyes sought Roy Larkin. His voice became terrible\nas he spoke a single word. \"--now.\"\n\nHe made a gesture with his hand toward the elder who had taken his\nmetal staff. The elder touched the staff in a certain place. Around\nRoy Larkin the plastic envelope vanished.\n\nRoy Larkin came to his feet, his fingers clutching the _Kell_ gun, the\nwild light of terror in his eyes. Looking at him, Boyd Larkin caught\nhis breath. There was such terror and wild fear in this man as he had\nnever seen before, such terror as might send death spurting from the\nmuzzle of the _Kell_ gun in a steady stream.\n\nLarkin saw his son's finger tighten on the trigger, an involuntary\nmovement. Malovar must have seen the movement too, all the Martian\nelders must have seen it. They must have known the meaning of it, must\nhave understood that they were facing death. Not a Martian moved a\nmuscle.\n\nRoy Larkin apparently had expected them to cringe, to fawn, to beg.\nWhen they did nothing, he seemed confused. Wonderingly he stared at\nthem. His gaze came to the face of his father. On his features the\nconfusion grew. His eyes came down to the _Kell_ gun. Something was\nhappening inside of him, what it was no man except he knew or could\nknow. As he seemed to realize he still held the gun, a look of horror\nappeared on his face. He dropped the weapon. It clattered on the stone\nfloor, the only sound in that vast silence.\n\nThen there was another sound, a sound that resembled the cry of a child\ngulping a single word--\"Daddy.\" Roy Larkin was saying that single word\nand he was moving toward his father.\n\n\"I've been so terribly wrong,\" Roy Larkin whispered. \"For so many years\nI've been wrong. I wanted to tell you, but I never could, until now.\"\n\nBoyd Larkin folded his son into his arms. The hard, bitter driving man\nthat he had known this morning was somehow gone. The man who was in his\narms and clutching his shoulders and burying his head against his chest\nwas somehow a little boy who had been lost, bewildered, and alone, and\nwho was no longer lost, who in this moment was growing to the stature\nof manhood.\n\nLarkin patted the shoulders of this man-boy. His eyes were moist and\nthere was a choke in his throat. Here was something that he had wanted\ndesperately for so many years. Now he had it. His son, his son!\n\nIn him somewhere was a feeling not of triumph but of vast achievement.\nHe looked over his son's shoulders at Malovar. The Martian's face was\nglowing as if he too was tasting this feeling of vast achievement.\nIn this moment Malovar no longer looked like a tribal god demanding\nvengeance. Malovar looked like a very gentle and kindly old Martian.\n\n\"Mine eyes have seen wonders this day,\" Malovar spoke. \"I think at the\nnext time of the testing all of you will be safe from me.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that?\" Larkin whispered.\n\n\"Of course. I never make careless statements.\" He made a gesture toward\nthe elder who held his metal staff.\n\nAround him Larkin was aware that the other humans were being freed from\nthe force envelopes that held them powerless. There were clattering\nsounds, the noises of weapons being dropped from hands that no longer\nchose to use them.\n\nOver the watching throng a sigh was rising, such a sigh as may come\nfrom the lips of those who have seen wonders past the understanding.\n\n\n\nAt the top of the coliseum, where the vast red deserts stretched away\nunder a thin harness of tiny canals, they paused.\n\nRoy Larkin had changed. The fear and the terror were gone. A different\nenthusiasm was in his voice. \"We can still bring minerals here but we\nwill no longer operate as I had planned. We will operate on a cost-plus\nbasis, we will deliver them here at a price....\"\n\n\"The buyer can afford,\" Boyd Larkin said softly.\n\n\"Right,\" his son said.\n\nBehind them stood Malovar and Seekin. Malovar grunted approvingly.\n\"Through such men as you, minerals can come to Mars--and with them new\nlife may come to an old and dying world.\"\n\nMalovar looked beyond the city to the red deserts. He seemed to be\nseeing them as vast stretches of greenery, as interlacing canals with\nlush vegetation covering all the land that now was desert but someday\nwould be something else. His face glowed.\n\n\"You also seem to have won a victory here,\" Boyd Larkin spoke.\n\n\"Yes,\" Malovar answered. \"I have blended the laws of my people with\nthe drive of you humans, made each aware of the other, made each\nrespect and support the other. The victory will be _there_, in the\nyears that are to come.\"\n\nHe gestured toward the deserts where in his imagination an old world\nwas again coming to life. The glow deepened on his face. He was seeing\na lost dream come true.\n\nBoyd Larkin had the fleeting impression that this old Martian ruler had\nsomehow manipulated and conspired the actions that had taken place in\nthe arena down below, that he had moved both his own people--and the\nhumans--like puppets on strings. For an instant the thought startled\nthe trader. Then he looked again at Malovar's face, saw the glow there,\nand knew that even if Malovar had manipulated them like puppets on\nstrings the purpose of Malovar's manipulations was clear. It was new\nlife on an old planet, new life for two peoples, the Martians and the\nhumans.\n\nWith that purpose, Boyd Larkin had complete sympathy.\n\nQuietly the four of them moved down from the top of the coliseum,\ntoward the peaked roofs of the city of Sudal.\n\nBeyond them, the red deserts already seemed to be greening with new\nvegetation, new life.\n",
