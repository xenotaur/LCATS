To\nme all that is detestable, and I am sure it is not the sort of thing that\nMiss Holmes would like.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe always had it at Christmas when we were young.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, mamma, the world is so changed.\u201d\n\nThe point in dispute was one very delicate in its nature, hardly to be\ndiscussed in all its bearings, even in fiction, and the very mention of\nwhich between mother and daughter showed a great amount of close\nconfidence between them.  It was no less than this.  Should that branch\nof mistletoe which Frank Garrow had brought home with him out of the\nLowther woods be hung up on Christmas Eve in the dining-room at Thwaite\nHall, according to his wishes; or should permission for such hanging be\npositively refused?  It was clearly a thing not to be done after such a\ndiscussion, and therefore the decision given by Mrs. Garrow was against\nit.\n\nI am inclined to think that Miss Garrow was right in saying that the\nworld is changed as touching mistletoe boughs.  Kissing, I fear, is less\ninnocent now than it used to be when our grand-mothers were alive, and we\nhave become more fastidious in our amusements.  Nevertheless, I think\nthat she made herself fairly open to the raillery with which her brothers\nattacked her.\n\n\u201cHoni soit qui mal y pense,\u201d said Frank, who was eighteen.\n\n\u201cNobody will want to kiss you, my lady Fineairs,\u201d said Harry, who was\njust a year younger.\n\n\u201cBecause you choose to be a Puritan, there are to be no more cakes and\nale in the house,\u201d said Frank.\n\n\u201cStill waters run deep; we all know that,\u201d said Harry.\n\nThe boys had not been present when the matter was decided between Mrs.\nGarrow and her daughter, nor had the mother been present when these\nlittle amenities had passed between the brothers and sister.\n\n\u201cOnly that mamma has said it, and I wouldn\u2019t seem to go against her,\u201d\nsaid Frank, \u201cI\u2019d ask my father.  He wouldn\u2019t give way to such nonsense, I\nknow.\u201d\n\nElizabeth turned away without answering, and left the room.  Her eyes\nwere full of tears, but she would not let them see that they had vexed\nher.  They were only two days home from school, and for the last week\nbefore their coming, all her thoughts had been to prepare for their\nChristmas pleasures.  She had arranged their rooms, making everything\nwarm and pretty.  Out of her own pocket she had bought a shot-belt for\none, and skates for the other.  She had told the old groom that her pony\nwas to belong exclusively to Master Harry for the holidays, and now Harry\ntold her that still waters ran deep.  She had been driven to the use of\nall her eloquence in inducing her father to purchase that gun for Frank,\nand now Frank called her a Puritan.  And why?  She did not choose that a\nmistletoe bough should be hung in her father\u2019s hall, when Godfrey Holmes\nwas coming to visit him.  She could not explain this to Frank, but Frank\nmight have had the wit to understand it.  But Frank was thinking only of\nPatty Coverdale, a blue-eyed little romp of sixteen, who, with her sister\nKate, was coming from Penrith to spend the Christmas at Thwaite Hall.\nElizabeth left the room with her slow, graceful step, hiding her\ntears,\u2014hiding all emotion, as latterly she had taught herself that it was\nfeminine to do.  \u201cThere goes my lady Fineairs,\u201d said Harry, sending his\nshrill voice after her.\n\nThwaite Hall was not a place of much pretension.  It was a moderate-sized\nhouse, surrounded by pretty gardens and shrubberies, close down upon the\nriver Eamont, on the Westmoreland side of the river, looking over to a\nlovely wooded bank in Cumberland.  All the world knows that the Eamont\nruns out of Ulleswater, dividing the two counties, passing under Penrith\nBridge and by the old ruins of Brougham Castle, below which it joins the\nEden.  Thwaite Hall nestled down close upon the clear rocky stream about\nhalf way between Ulleswater and Penrith, and had been built just at a\nbend of the river.  The windows of the dining-parlour and of the\ndrawing-room stood at right angles to each other, and yet each commanded\na reach of the stream.  Immediately from a side of the house steps were\ncut down through the red rock to the water\u2019s edge, and here a small boat\nwas always moored to a chain.  The chain was stretched across the river,\nfixed to the staples driven into the rock on either side, and the boat\nwas pulled backwards and forwards over the stream without aid from oars\nor paddles.  From the opposite side a path led through the woods and\nacross the fields to Penrith, and this was the route commonly used\nbetween Thwaite Hall and the town.\n\nMajor Garrow was a retired officer of Engineers, who had seen service in\nall parts of the world, and who was now spending the evening of his days\non a small property which had come to him from his father.  He held in\nhis own hands about twenty acres of land, and he was the owner of one\nsmall farm close by, which was let to a tenant.  That, together with his\nhalf-pay, and the interest of his wife\u2019s thousand pounds, sufficed to\neducate his children and keep the wolf at a comfortable distance from his\ndoor.  He himself was a spare thin man, with quiet, lazy, literary\nhabits.  He had done the work of life, but had so done it as to permit of\nhis enjoying that which was left to him.  His sole remaining care was the\nestablishment of his children; and, as far as he could see, he had no\nground for anticipating disappointment.  They were clever, good-looking,\nwell-disposed young people, and upon the whole it may be said that the\nsun shone brightly on Thwaite Hall.  Of Mrs. Garrow it may suffice to say\nthat she always deserved such sunshine.\n\nFor years past it had been the practice of the family to have some sort\nof gathering at Thwaite Hall during Christmas.  Godfrey Holmes had been\nleft under the guardianship of Major Garrow, and, as he had always spent\nhis Christmas holidays with his guardian, this, perhaps, had given rise\nto the practice.  Then the Coverdales were cousins of the Garrows, and\nthey had usually been there as children.  At the Christmas last past the\ncustom had been broken, for young Holmes had been abroad.  Previous to\nthat, they had all been children, excepting him.  But now that they were\nto meet again, they were no longer children.  Elizabeth, at any rate, was\nnot so, for she had already counted nineteen winters.  And Isabella\nHolmes was coming.  Now Isabella was two years older than Elizabeth, and\nhad been educated in Brussels; moreover she was comparatively a stranger\nat Thwaite Hall, never having been at those early Christmas meetings.\n\nAnd now I must take permission to begin my story by telling a lady\u2019s\nsecret.  Elizabeth Garrow had already been in love with Godfrey Holmes,\nor perhaps it might be more becoming to say that Godfrey Holmes had\nalready been in love with her.  They had already been engaged; and, alas!\nthey had already agreed that that engagement should be broken off!\n\nYoung Holmes was now twenty-seven years of age, and was employed in a\nbank at Liverpool, not as a clerk, but as assistant-manager, with a large\nsalary.  He was a man well to do in the world, who had money also of his\nown, and who might well afford to marry.  Some two years since, on the\neve of leaving Thwaite Hall, he had with low doubting whisper told\nElizabeth that he loved her, and she had flown trembling to her mother.\n\u201cGodfrey, my boy,\u201d the father said to him, as he parted with him the next\nmorning, \u201cBessy is only a child, and too young to think of this yet.\u201d  At\nthe next Christmas Godfrey was in Italy, and the thing was gone by,\u2014so at\nleast the father and mother said to each other.  But the young people had\nmet in the summer, and one joyful letter had come from the girl home to\nher mother.  \u201cI have accepted him.  Dearest, dearest mamma, I do love\nhim.  But don\u2019t tell papa yet, for I have not quite accepted him.  I\nthink I am sure, but I am not quite sure.  I am not quite sure about\nhim.\u201d\n\nAnd then, two days after that, there had come a letter that was not at\nall joyful.  \u201cDearest Mamma,\u2014It is not to be.  It is not written in the\nbook.  We have both agreed that it will not do.  I am so glad that you\nhave not told dear papa, for I could never make him understand.  You will\nunderstand, for I shall tell you everything, down to his very words.  But\nwe have agreed that there shall be no quarrel.  It shall be exactly as it\nwas, and he will come at Christmas all the same.  It would never do that\nhe and papa should be separated, nor could we now put off Isabella.  It\nis better so in every way, for there is and need be no quarrel.  We still\nlike each other.  I am sure I like him, but I know that I should not make\nhim happy as his wife.  He says it is my fault.  I, at any rate, have\nnever told him that I thought it his.\u201d  From all which it will be seen\nthat the confidence between the mother and daughter was very close.\n\nElizabeth Garrow was a very good girl, but it might almost be a question\nwhether she was not too good.  She had learned, or thought that she had\nlearned, that most girls are vapid, silly, and useless,\u2014given chiefly to\npleasure-seeking and a hankering after lovers; and she had resolved that\nshe would not be such a one.\n\nIndustry, self-denial, and a religious purpose in life, were the tasks\nwhich she set herself; and she went about the performance of them with\nmuch courage.  But such tasks, though they are excellently well adapted\nto fit a young lady for the work of living, may also be carried too far,\nand thus have the effect of unfitting her for that work.  When Elizabeth\nGarrow made up her mind that the finding of a husband was not the only\npurpose of life, she did very well.  It is very well that a young lady\nshould feel herself capable of going through the world happily without\none.  But in teaching herself this she also taught herself to think that\nthere was a certain merit in refusing herself the natural delight of a\nlover, even though the possession of the lover were compatible with all\nher duties to herself, her father and mother, and the world at large.  It\nwas not that she had determined to have no lover.  She made no such\nresolve, and when the proper lover came he was admitted to her heart.\nBut she declared to herself unconsciously that she must put a guard upon\nherself, lest she should be betrayed into weakness by her own happiness.\nShe had resolved that in loving her lord she would not worship him, and\nthat in giving her heart she would only so give it as it should be given\nto a human creature like herself.  She had acted on these high resolves,\nand hence it had come to pass,\u2014not unnaturally,\u2014that Mr. Godfrey Holmes\nhad told her that it was \u201cher fault.\u201d\n\nShe was a pretty, fair girl, with soft dark-brown hair, and soft long\ndark eyelashes.  Her grey eyes, though quiet in their tone, were tender\nand lustrous.  Her face was oval, and the lines of her cheek and chin\nperfect in their symmetry.  She was generally quiet in her demeanour, but\nwhen moved she could rouse herself to great energy, and speak with\nfeeling and almost with fire.  Her fault was a reverence for martyrdom in\ngeneral, and a feeling, of which she was unconscious, that it became a\nyoung woman to be unhappy in secret;\u2014that it became a young woman, I\nmight rather say, to have a source of unhappiness hidden from the world\nin general, and endured without any detriment to her outward\ncheerfulness.  We know the story of the Spartan boy who held the fox\nunder his tunic.  The fox was biting into him,\u2014into the very entrails;\nbut the young hero spake never a word.  Now Bessy Garrow was inclined to\nthink that it was a good thing to have a fox always biting, so that the\ntorment caused no ruffling to her outward smiles.  Now at this moment the\nfox within her bosom was biting her sore enough, but she bore it without\nflinching.\n\n\u201cIf you would rather that he should not come I will have it arranged,\u201d\nher mother had said to her.\n\n\u201cNot for worlds,\u201d she had answered.  \u201cI should never think well of myself\nagain.\u201d\n\nHer mother had changed her own mind more than once as to the conduct in\nthis matter which might be best for her to follow, thinking solely of her\ndaughter\u2019s welfare.  \u201cIf he comes they will be reconciled, and she will\nbe happy,\u201d had been her first idea.  But then there was a stern fixedness\nof purpose in Bessy\u2019s words when she spoke of Mr. Holmes, which had\nexpelled this hope, and Mrs. Garrow had for a while thought it better\nthat the young man should not come.  But Bessy would not permit this.  It\nwould vex her father, put out of course the arrangements of other people,\nand display weakness on her own part.  He should come, and she would\nendure without flinching while the fox gnawed at her.\n\nThat battle of the mistletoe had been fought on the morning before\nChristmas-day, and the Holmeses came on Christmas-eve.  Isabella was\ncomparatively a stranger, and therefore received at first the greater\nshare of attention.  She and Elizabeth had once seen each other, and for\nthe last year or two had corresponded, but personally they had never been\nintimate.  Unfortunately for the latter, that story of Godfrey\u2019s offer\nand acceptance had been communicated to Isabella, as had of course the\nimmediately subsequent story of their separation.  But now it would be\nalmost impossible to avoid the subject in conversation.  \u201cDearest\nIsabella, let it be as though it had never been,\u201d she had said in one of\nher letters.  But sometimes it is very difficult to let things be as\nthough they had never been.\n\nThe first evening passed over very well.  The two Coverdale girls were\nthere, and there had been much talking and merry laughter, rather\njuvenile in its nature, but on the whole none the worse for that.\nIsabella Holmes was a fine, tall, handsome girl; good-humoured, and well\ndisposed to be pleased; rather Frenchified in her manners, and quite able\nto take care of herself.  But she was not above round games, and did not\nturn up her nose at the boys.  Godfrey behaved himself excellently,\ntalking much to the Major, but by no means avoiding Miss Garrow.  Mrs.\nGarrow, though she had known him since he was a boy, had taken an\naversion to him since he had quarrelled with her daughter; but there was\nno room on this first night for showing such aversion, and everything\nwent off well.\n\n\u201cGodfrey is very much improved,\u201d the Major said to his wife that night.\n\n\u201cDo you think so?\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed I do.  He has filled out and become a fine man.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn personal appearance, you mean.  Yes, he is well-looking enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd in his manner, too.  He is doing uncommonly well in Liverpool, I can\ntell you; and if he should think of Bessy\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is nothing of that sort,\u201d said Mrs. Garrow.\n\n\u201cHe did speak to me, you know,\u2014two years ago.  Bessy was too young then,\nand so indeed was he.  But if she likes him\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she does.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen there\u2019s an end of it.\u201d  And so they went to bed.\n\n\u201cFrank,\u201d said the sister to her elder brother, knocking at his door when\nthey had all gone up stairs, \u201cmay I come in,\u2014if you are not in bed?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn bed,\u201d said he, looking up with some little pride from his Greek book;\n\u201cI\u2019ve one hundred and fifty lines to do before I can get to bed.  It\u2019ll\nbe two, I suppose.  I\u2019ve got to mug uncommon hard these holidays.  I have\nonly one more half, you know, and then\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t overdo it, Frank.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo; I won\u2019t overdo it.  I mean to take one day a week, and work eight\nhours a day on the other five.  That will be forty hours a week, and will\ngive me just two hundred hours for the holidays.  I have got it all down\nhere on a table.  That will be a hundred and five for Greek play, forty\nfor Algebra\u2014\u201d and so he explained to her the exact destiny of all his\nlong hours of proposed labour.  He had as yet been home a day and a half,\nand had succeeded in drawing out with red lines and blue figures the\ntable which he showed her.  \u201cIf I can do that, it will be pretty well;\nwon\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, Frank, you have come home for your holidays,\u2014to enjoy yourself?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut a fellow must work now-a-days.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t overdo it, dear; that\u2019s all.  But, Frank, I could not rest if I\nwent to bed without speaking to you.  You made me unhappy to-day.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid I, Bessy?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou called me a Puritan, and then you quoted that ill-natured French\nproverb at me.  Do you really believe your sister thinks evil, Frank?\u201d\nand as she spoke she put her arm caressingly round his neck.\n\n\u201cOf course I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why say so?  Harry is so much younger and so thoughtless that I can\nbear what he says without so much suffering.  But if you and I are not\nfriends I shall be very wretched.  If you knew how I have looked forward\nto your coming home!\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not mean to vex you, and I won\u2019t say such things again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my own Frank.  What I said to mamma, I said because I thought it\nright; but you must not say that I am a Puritan.  I would do anything in\nmy power to make your holidays bright and pleasant.  I know that boys\nrequire so much more to amuse them than girls do.  Good night, dearest;\npray don\u2019t overdo yourself with work, and do take care of your eyes.\u201d\n\nSo saying she kissed him and went her way.  In twenty minutes after that,\nhe had gone to sleep over his book; and when he woke up to find the\ncandle guttering down, he resolved that he would not begin his measured\nhours till Christmas-day was fairly over.\n\nThe morning of Christmas-day passed very quietly.  They all went to\nchurch, and then sat round the fire chatting until the four o\u2019clock\ndinner was ready.  The Coverdale girls thought it was rather more dull\nthan former Thwaite Hall festivities, and Frank was seen to yawn.  But\nthen everybody knows that the real fun of Christmas never begins till the\nday itself be passed.  The beef and pudding are ponderous, and unless\nthere be absolute children in the party, there is a difficulty in\ngrafting any special afternoon amusements on the Sunday pursuits of the\nmorning.  In the evening they were to have a dance; that had been\ndistinctly promised to Patty Coverdale; but the dance would not commence\ntill eight.  The beef and pudding were ponderous, but with due efforts\nthey were overcome and disappeared.  The glass of port was sipped, the\nalmonds and raisins were nibbled, and then the ladies left the room.  Ten\nminutes after that Elizabeth found herself seated with Isabella Holmes\nover the fire in her father\u2019s little book-room.  It was not by her that\nthis meeting was arranged, for she dreaded such a constrained confidence;\nbut of course it could not be avoided, and perhaps it might be as well\nnow as hereafter.\n\n\u201cBessy,\u201d said the elder girl, \u201cI am dying to be alone with you for a\nmoment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you shall not die; that is, if being alone with me will save you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have so much to say to you.  And if you have any true friendship in\nyou, you also will have so much to say to me.\u201d\n\nMiss Garrow perhaps had no true friendship in her at that moment, for she\nwould gladly have avoided saying anything, had that been possible.  But\nin order to prove that she was not deficient in friendship, she gave her\nfriend her hand.\n\n\u201cAnd now tell me everything about Godfrey,\u201d said Isabella.\n\n\u201cDear Bella, I have nothing to tell;\u2014literally nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is nonsense.  Stop a moment, dear, and understand that I do not\nmean to offend you.  It cannot be that you have nothing to tell, if you\nchoose to tell it.  You are not the girl to have accepted Godfrey without\nloving him, nor is he the man to have asked you without loving you.  When\nyou write me word that you have changed your mind, as you might about a\ndress, of course I know you have not told me all.  Now I insist upon\nknowing it,\u2014that is, if we are to be friends.  I would not speak a word\nto Godfrey till I had seen you, in order that I might hear your story\nfirst.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, Bella, there is no story to tell.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I must ask him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you wish to play the part of a true friend to me, you will let the\nmatter pass by and say nothing.  You must understand that, circumstanced\nas we are, your brother\u2019s visit here,\u2014what I mean is, that it is very\ndifficult for me to act and speak exactly as I should do, and a few\nunfortunate words spoken may make my position unendurable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you answer me one question?\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot tell.  I think I will.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you love him?\u201d  For a moment or two Bessy remained silent, striving\nto arrange her words so that they should contain no falsehood, and yet\nbetray no truth.  \u201cAh, I see you do,\u201d continued Miss Holmes.  \u201cBut of\ncourse you do.  Why else did you accept him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI fancied that I did, as young ladies do sometimes fancy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd will you say that you do not, now?\u201d  Again Bessy was silent, and\nthen her friend rose from her seat.  \u201cI see it all,\u201d she said.  \u201cWhat a\npity it was that you both had not some friend like me by you at the time!\nBut perhaps it may not be too late.\u201d\n\nI need not repeat at length all the protestations which upon this were\npoured forth with hot energy by poor Bessy.  She endeavoured to explain\nhow great had been the difficulty of her position.  This Christmas visit\nhad been arranged before that unhappy affair at Liverpool had occurred.\nIsabella\u2019s visit had been partly one of business, it being necessary that\ncertain money affairs should be arranged between her, her brother, and\nthe Major.  \u201cI determined,\u201d said Bessy, \u201cnot to let my feelings stand in\nthe way; and hoped that things might settle down to their former friendly\nfooting.  I already fear that I have been wrong, but it will be\nungenerous in you to punish me.\u201d  Then she went on to say that if anybody\nattempted to interfere with her, she should at once go away to her\nmother\u2019s sister, who lived at Hexham, in Northumberland.\n\nThen came the dance, and the hearts of Kate and Patty Coverdale were at\nlast happy.  But here again poor Bessy was made to understand how\nterribly difficult was this experiment of entertaining on a footing of\nfriendship a lover with whom she had quarrelled only a month or two\nbefore.  That she must as a necessity become the partner of Godfrey\nHolmes she had already calculated, and so much she was prepared to\nendure.  Her brothers would of course dance with the Coverdale girls, and\nher father would of course stand up with Isabella.  There was no other\npossible arrangement, at any rate as a beginning.\n\nShe had schooled herself, too, as to the way in which she would speak to\nhim on the occasion, and how she would remain mistress of herself and of\nher thoughts.  But when the time came the difficulty was almost too much\nfor her.\n\n\u201cYou do not care much for dancing, if I remember?\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cOh yes, I do.  Not as Patty Coverdale does.  It\u2019s a passion with her.\nBut then I am older than Patty Coverdale.\u201d  After that he was silent for\na minute or two.\n\n\u201cIt seems so odd to me to be here again,\u201d he said.  It was odd;\u2014she felt\nthat it was odd.  But he ought not to have said so.\n\n\u201cTwo years make a great difference.  The boys have grown so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and there are other things,\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cBella was never here before; at least not with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.  But I did not exactly mean that.  All that would not make the place\nso strange.  But your mother seems altered to me.  She used to be almost\nlike my own mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose she finds that you are a more formidable person as you grow\nolder.  It was all very well scolding you when you were a clerk in the\nbank, but it does not do to scold the manager.  These are the penalties\nmen pay for becoming great.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not my greatness that stands in my way, but\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019m sure I cannot say what it is.  But Patty will scold you if you\ndo not mind the figure, though you were the whole Board of Directors\npacked into one.  She won\u2019t respect you if you neglect your present\nwork.\u201d\n\nWhen Bessy went to bed that night she began to feel that she had\nattempted too much.  \u201cMamma,\u201d she said, \u201ccould I not make some excuse and\ngo away to Aunt Mary?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, mamma; now; to-morrow.  I need not say that it will make me very\nunhappy to be away at such a time, but I begin to think that it will be\nbetter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat will papa say?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must tell him all.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Aunt Mary must be told also.  You would not like that.  Has he said\nanything?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, nothing;\u2014very little, that is.  But Bella has spoken to me.  Oh,\nmamma, I think we have been very wrong in this.  That is, I have been\nwrong.  I feel as though I should disgrace myself, and turn the whole\nparty here into a misfortune.\u201d\n\nIt would be dreadful, that telling of the story to her father and to her\naunt, and such a necessity must, if possible, be avoided.  Should such a\nnecessity actually come, the former task would, no doubt, be done by her\nmother, but that would not lighten the load materially.  After a\nfortnight she would again meet her father, and would be forced to discuss\nit.  \u201cI will remain if it be possible,\u201d she said; \u201cbut, mamma, if I wish\nto go, you will not stop me?\u201d  Her mother promised that she would not\nstop her, but strongly advised her to stand her ground.\n\nOn the following morning, when she came down stairs before breakfast, she\nfound Frank standing in the hall with his gun, of which he was trying the\nlock.  \u201cIt is not loaded, is it, Frank?\u201d said she.\n\n\u201cOh dear, no; no one thinks of loading now-a-days till he has got out of\nthe house.  Directly after breakfast I am going across with Godfrey to\nthe back of Greystock, to see after some moor-fowl.  He asked me to go,\nand I couldn\u2019t well refuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not.  Why should you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be deuced hard work to make up the time.  I was to have been up\nat four this morning, but that alarum went off and never woke me.\nHowever, I shall be able to do something to-night.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make a slavery of your holidays, Frank.  What\u2019s the good of having\na new gun if you\u2019re not to use it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the new gun.  I\u2019m not such a child as that comes to.  But, you\nsee, Godfrey is here, and one ought to be civil to him.  I\u2019ll tell you\nwhat I want you girls to do, Bessy.  You must come and meet us on our way\nhome.  Come over in the boat and along the path to the Patterdale road.\nWe\u2019ll be there under the hill about five.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if you are not, we are to wait in the snow?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make difficulties, Bessy.  I tell you we will be there.  We are to\ngo in the cart, and so shall have plenty of time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how do you know the other girls will go?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, to tell you the truth, Patty Coverdale has promised.  As for Miss\nHolmes, if she won\u2019t, why you must leave her at home with mamma.  But\nKate and Patty can\u2019t come without you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour discretion has found that out, has it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey say so.  But you will come; won\u2019t you, Bessy?  As for waiting, it\u2019s\nall nonsense.  Of course you can walk on.  But we\u2019ll be at the stile by\nfive.  I\u2019ve got my watch, you know.\u201d  And then Bessy promised him.  What\nwould she not have done for him that was in her power to do?\n\n\u201cGo!  Of course I\u2019ll go,\u201d said Miss Holmes.  \u201cI\u2019m up to anything.  I\u2019d\nhave gone with them this morning, and have taken a gun if they\u2019d asked\nme.  But, by-the-bye, I\u2019d better not.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d said Patty, who was hardly yet without fear lest something\nshould mar the expedition.\n\n\u201cWhat will three gentlemen do with four ladies?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I forgot,\u201d said Patty innocently.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t care,\u201d said Kate; \u201cyou may have Harry if you like.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for nothing,\u201d said Miss Holmes.  \u201cI want one for myself.  It\u2019s\nall very well for you to make the offer, but what should I do if Harry\nwouldn\u2019t have me?  There are two sides, you know, to every bargain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he isn\u2019t anything to me,\u201d said Kate.  \u201cWhy, he\u2019s not quite\nseventeen years old yet!\u201d\n\n\u201cPoor boy!  What a shame to dispose of him so soon.  We\u2019ll let him off\nfor a year or two; won\u2019t we, Miss Coverdale?  But as there seems by\nacknowledgment to be one beau with unappropriated services\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I have appropriated nobody,\u201d said Patty, \u201cand didn\u2019t intend.\u201d\n\n\u201cGodfrey, then, is the only knight whose services are claimed,\u201d said Miss\nHolmes, looking at Bessy.  Bessy made no immediate answer with either her\neyes or tongue; but when the Coverdales were gone, she took her new\nfriend to task.\n\n\u201cHow can you fill those young girls\u2019 heads with such nonsense?\u201d\n\n\u201cNature has done that, my dear.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut nature should be trained; should it not?  You will make them think\nthat those foolish boys are in love with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe foolish boys, as you call them, will look after that themselves.  It\nseems to me that the foolish boys know what they are about better than\nsome of their elders.\u201d  And then, after a moment\u2019s pause, she added, \u201cAs\nfor my brother, I have no patience with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cPray do not discuss your brother,\u201d said Bessy.  \u201cAnd, Bella, unless you\nwish to drive me away, pray do not speak of him and me together as you\ndid just now.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you so bad as that,\u2014that the slightest commonplace joke upsets you?\nWould not his services be due to you as a matter of course?  If you are\nso sore about it, you will betray your own secret.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no secret,\u2014none at least from you, or from mamma; and, indeed,\nnone from him.  We were both very foolish, thinking that we knew each\nother and our own hearts, when we knew neither.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate to hear people talk of knowing their hearts.  My idea is, that if\nyou like a young man, and he asks you to marry him, you ought to have\nhim.  That is, if there is enough to live on.  I don\u2019t know what more is\nwanted.  But girls are getting to talk and think as though they were to\nsend their hearts through some fiery furnace of trial before they may\ngive them up to a husband\u2019s keeping.  I am not at all sure that the\nFrench fashion is not the best, and that these things shouldn\u2019t be\nmanaged by the fathers and mothers, or perhaps by the family lawyers.\nGirls who are so intent upon knowing their own hearts generally end by\nknowing nobody\u2019s heart but their own; and then they die old maids.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter that than give themselves to the keeping of those they don\u2019t know\nand cannot esteem.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a matter of taste.  I mean to take the first that comes, so long\nas he looks like a gentleman, and has not less than eight hundred a year.\nNow Godfrey does look like a gentleman, and has double that.  If I had\nsuch a chance I shouldn\u2019t think twice about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I have no such chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way the wind blows; is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no.  Oh, Bella, pray, pray leave me alone.  Pray do not interfere.\nThere is no wind blowing in any way.  All that I want is your silence and\nyour sympathy.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well.  I will be silent and sympathetic as the grave.  Only don\u2019t\nimagine that I am cold as the grave also.  I don\u2019t exactly appreciate\nyour ideas; but if I can do no good, I will at any rate endeavour to do\nno harm.\u201d\n\nAfter lunch, at about three, they started on their walk, and managed to\nferry themselves over the river.  \u201cOh, do let me, Bessy,\u201d said Kate\nCoverdale.  \u201cI understand all about it.  Look here, Miss Holmes.  You\npull the chain through your hands\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd inevitably tear your gloves to pieces,\u201d said Miss Holmes.  Kate\ncertainly had done so, and did not seem to be particularly well pleased\nwith the accident.  \u201cThere\u2019s a nasty nail in the chain,\u201d she said.  \u201cI\nwonder those stupid boys did not tell us.\u201d\n\nOf course they reached the trysting-place much too soon, and were very\ntired of walking up and down to keep their feet warm, before the\nsportsmen came up.  But this was their own fault, seeing that they had\nreached the stile half an hour before the time fixed.\n\n\u201cI never will go anywhere to meet gentlemen again,\u201d said Miss Holmes.\n\u201cIt is most preposterous that ladies should be left in the snow for an\nhour.  Well, young men, what sport have you had?\u201d\n\n\u201cI shot the big black cock,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cDid you indeed?\u201d said Kate Coverdale.\n\n\u201cAnd here are the feathers out of his tail for you.  He dropped them in\nthe water, and I had to go in after them up to my middle.  But I told you\nthat I would, so I was determined to get them.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you silly, silly boy,\u201d said Kate.  \u201cBut I\u2019ll keep them for ever.  I\nwill indeed.\u201d  This was said a little apart, for Harry had managed to\ndraw the young lady aside before he presented the feathers.\n\nFrank had also his trophies for Patty, and the tale to tell of his own\nprowess.  In that he was a year older than his brother, he was by a\nyear\u2019s growth less ready to tender his present to his lady-love, openly\nin the presence of them all.  But he found his opportunity, and then he\nand Patty went on a little in advance.  Kate also was deep in her\nconsolations to Harry for his ducking; and therefore the four disposed of\nthemselves in the manner previously suggested by Miss Holmes.  Miss\nHolmes, therefore, and her brother, and Bessy Garrow, were left together\nin the path, and discussed the performances of the day in a manner that\nelicited no very ecstatic interest.  So they walked for a mile, and by\ndegrees the conversation between them dwindled down almost to nothing.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing I dislike so much as coming out with people younger\nthan myself,\u201d said Miss Holmes.  \u201cOne always feels so old and dull.\nListen to those children there; they make me feel as though I were an old\nmaiden aunt, brought out with them to do propriety.\u201d\n\n\u201cPatty won\u2019t at all approve if she hears you call her a child.\u201d\n\n\u201cNor shall I approve, if she treats me like an old woman,\u201d and then she\nstepped on and joined the children.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t spoil even their sport\nif I could help it,\u201d she said to herself.  \u201cBut with them I shall only be\na temporary nuisance; if I remain behind I shall become a permanent\nevil.\u201d  And thus Bessy and her old lover were left by themselves.\n\n\u201cI hope you will get on well with Bella,\u201d said Godfrey, when they had\nremained silent for a minute or two.\n\n\u201cOh, yes.  She is so good-natured and light-spirited that everybody must\nlike her.  She has been used to so much amusement and active life, that I\nknow she must find it very dull here.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is never dull anywhere,\u2014even at Liverpool, which, for a young lady,\nI sometimes think the dullest place on earth.  I know it is for a man.\u201d\n\n\u201cA man who has work to do can never be dull; can he?\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed he can; as dull as death.  I am so often enough.  I have never\nbeen very bright there, Bessy, since you left us.\u201d\n\nThere was nothing in his calling her Bessy, for it had become a habit\nwith him since they were children; and they had formerly agreed that\neverything between them should be as it had been before that foolish\nwhisper of love had been spoken and received.  Indeed, provision had been\nmade by them specially on this point, so that there need be no\nawkwardness in this mode of addressing each other.  Such provision had\nseemed to be very prudent, but it hardly had the desired effect on the\npresent occasion.\n\n\u201cI hardly know what you mean by brightness,\u201d she said, after a pause.\n\u201cPerhaps it is not intended that people\u2019s lives should be what you call\nbright.\u201d\n\n\u201cLife ought to be as bright as we can make it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt all depends on the meaning of the word.  I suppose we are not very\nbright here at Thwaite Hall, but yet we think ourselves very happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sure you are,\u201d said Godfrey.  \u201cI very often think of you here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe always think of places where we have been when we were young,\u201d said\nBessy; and then again they walked on for some way in silence, and Bessy\nbegan to increase her pace with the view of catching the children.  The\npresent walk to her was anything but bright, and she bethought herself\nwith dismay that there were still two miles before she reached the Ferry.\n\n\u201cBessy,\u201d Godfrey said at last.  And then he stopped as though he were\ndoubtful how to proceed.  She, however, did not say a word, but walked on\nquickly, as though her only hope was in catching the party before her.\nBut they also were walking quickly, for Bella was determined that she\nwould not be caught.\n\n\u201cBessy, I must speak to you once of what passed between us at Liverpool.\u201d\n\n\u201cMust you?\u201d said she.\n\n\u201cUnless you positively forbid it.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop, Godfrey,\u201d she said.  And they did stop in the path, for now she no\nlonger thought of putting an end to her embarrassment by overtaking her\ncompanions.  \u201cIf any such words are necessary for your comfort, it would\nhardly become me to forbid them.  Were I to speak so harshly you would\naccuse me afterwards in your own heart.  It must be for you to judge\nwhether it is well to reopen a wound that is nearly healed.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut with me it is not nearly healed.  The wound is open always.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are some hurts,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich do not admit of an absolute and\nperfect cure, unless after long years.\u201d  As she said so, she could not\nbut think how much better was his chance of such perfect cure than her\nown.  With her,\u2014so she said to herself,\u2014such curing was all but\nimpossible; whereas with him, it was as impossible that the injury should\nlast.\n\n\u201cBessy,\u201d he said, and he again stopped her on the narrow path, standing\nimmediately before her on the way, \u201cyou remember all the circumstances\nthat made us part?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; I think I remember them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you still think that we were right to part?\u201d\n\nShe paused for a moment before she answered him; but it was only for a\nmoment, and then she spoke quite firmly.  \u201cYes, Godfrey, I do; I have\nthought about it much since then.  I have thought, I fear, to no good\npurpose about aught else.  But I have never thought that we had been\nunwise in that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet I think you loved me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am bound to confess I did so, as otherwise I must confess myself a\nliar.  I told you at the time that I loved you, and I told you so truly.\nBut it is better, ten times better, that those who love should part, even\nthough they still should love, than that two should be joined together\nwho are incapable of making each other happy.  Remember what you told\nme.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do remember.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou found yourself unhappy in your engagement, and you said it was my\nfault.\u201d\n\n\u201cBessy, there is my hand.  If you have ceased to love me, there is an end\nof it.  But if you love me still, let all that be forgotten.\u201d\n\n\u201cForgotten, Godfrey!  How can it be forgotten?  You were unhappy, and it\nwas my fault.  My fault, as it would be if I tried to solace a sick child\nwith arithmetic, or feed a dog with grass.  I had no right to love you,\nknowing you as I did; and knowing also that my ways would not be your\nways.  My punishment I understand, and it is not more than I can bear;\nbut I had hoped that your punishment would have been soon over.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are too proud, Bessy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is very likely.  Frank says that I am a Puritan, and pride was the\nworst of their sins.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo proud and unbending.  In marriage should not the man and woman adapt\nthemselves to each other?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen they are married, yes.  And every girl who thinks of marrying\nshould know that in very much she must adapt herself to her husband.  But\nI do not think that a woman should be the ivy, to take the direction of\nevery branch of the tree to which she clings.  If she does so, what can\nbe her own character?  But we must go on, or we shall be too late.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you will give me no other answer?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone other, Godfrey.  Have you not just now, at this very moment, told\nme that I was too proud?  Can it be possible that you should wish to tie\nyourself for life to female pride?  And if you tell me that now, at such\na moment as this, what would you tell me in the close intimacy of married\nlife, when the trifles of every day would have worn away the courtesies\nof guest and lover?\u201d\n\nThere was a sharpness of rebuke in this which Godfrey Holmes could not at\nthe moment overcome.  Nevertheless he knew the girl, and understood the\nworkings of her heart and mind.  Now, in her present state, she could be\nunbending, proud, and almost rough.  In that she had much to lose in\ndeclining the renewed offer which he made her, she would, as it were,\ncontinually prompt herself to be harsh and inflexible.  Had he been poor,\nhad she not loved him, had not all good things seemed to have attended\nthe promise of such a marriage, she would have been less suspicious of\nherself in receiving the offer, and more gracious in replying to it.  Had\nhe lost all his money before he came back to her, she would have taken\nhim at once; or had he been deprived of an eye, or become crippled in his\nlegs, she would have done so.  But, circumstanced as he was, she had no\nmotive to tenderness.  There was an organic defect in her character,\nwhich no doubt was plainly marked by its own bump in her cranium,\u2014the\nbump of philomartyrdom, it might properly be called.  She had shipwrecked\nher own happiness in rejecting Godfrey Holmes; but it seemed to her to be\nthe proper thing that a well-behaved young lady should shipwreck her own\nhappiness.  For the last month or two she had been tossed about by the\nwaters and was nearly drowned.  Now there was beautiful land again close\nto her, and a strong pleasant hand stretched out to save her.  But though\nshe had suffered terribly among the waves, she still thought it wrong to\nbe saved.  It would be so pleasant to take that hand, so sweet, so\njoyous, that it surely must be wrong.  That was her doctrine; and Godfrey\nHolmes, though he hardly analysed the matter, partly understood that it\nwas so.  And yet, if once she were landed on that green island, she would\nbe so happy.  She spoke with scorn of a woman clinging to a tree like\nivy; and yet, were she once married, no woman would cling to her husband\nwith sweeter feminine tenacity than Bessy Garrow.  He spoke no further\nword to her as he walked home, but in handing her down to the ferry-boat\nhe pressed her hand.  For a second it seemed as though she had returned\nthis pressure.  If so, the action was involuntary, and her hand instantly\nresumed its stiffness to his touch.\n\nIt was late that night when Major Garrow went to his bedroom, but his\nwife was still up, waiting for him.  \u201cWell,\u201d said she, \u201cwhat has he said\nto you?  He has been with you above an hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch stories are not very quickly told; and in this case it was\nnecessary to understand him very accurately.  At length I think I do\nunderstand him.\u201d\n\nIt is not necessary to repeat at length all that was said on that night\nbetween Major and Mrs. Garrow, as to the offer which had now for a third\ntime been made to their daughter.  On that evening, after the ladies had\ngone, and when the two boys had taken themselves off, Godfrey Holmes told\nhis tale to his host, and had honestly explained to him what he believed\nto be the state of his daughter\u2019s feelings.  \u201cNow you know all,\u201d said he.\n\u201cI do believe that she loves me, and if she does, perhaps she may still\nlisten to you.\u201d  Major Garrow did not feel sure that he \u201cknew it all.\u201d\nBut when he had fully discussed the matter that night with his wife, then\nhe thought that perhaps he had arrived at that knowledge.\n\nOn the following morning Bessy learned from the maid, at an early hour,\nthat Godfrey Holmes had left Thwaite Hall and gone back to Liverpool.  To\nthe girl she said nothing on the subject, but she felt obliged to say a\nword or two to Bella.  \u201cIt is his coming that I regret,\u201d she said;\u2014\u201cthat\nhe should have had the trouble and annoyance for nothing.  I acknowledge\nthat it was my fault, and I am very sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt cannot be helped,\u201d said Miss Holmes, somewhat gravely.  \u201cAs to his\nmisfortunes, I presume that his journeys between here and Liverpool are\nnot the worst of them.\u201d\n\nAfter breakfast on that day Bessy was summoned into her father\u2019s\nbook-room, and found him there, and her mother also.  \u201cBessy,\u201d said he,\n\u201csit down, my dear.  You know why Godfrey has left us this morning?\u201d\n\nBessy walked round the room, so that in sitting she might be close to her\nmother and take her mother\u2019s hand in her own.  \u201cI suppose I do, papa,\u201d\nshe said.\n\n\u201cHe was with me late last night, Bessy; and when he told me what had\npassed between you I agreed with him that he had better go.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was better that he should go, papa.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he has left a message for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cA message, papa?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Bessy.  And your mother agrees with me that it had better be given\nto you.  It is this,\u2014that if you will send him word to come again, he\nwill be here by Twelfth-night.  He came before on my invitation, but if\nhe returns it must be on yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, papa, I cannot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not say that you can, but think of it calmly before you altogether\nrefuse.  You shall give me your answer on New Year\u2019s morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cMamma knows that it would be impossible,\u201d said Bessy.\n\n\u201cNot impossible, dearest.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn such a matter you should do what you believe to be right,\u201d said her\nfather.\n\n\u201cIf I were to ask him here again, it would be telling him that I would\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly, Bessy.  It would be telling him that you would be his wife.  He\nwould understand it so, and so would your mother and I.  It must be so\nunderstood altogether.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, papa, when we were at Liverpool\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have told him everything, dearest,\u201d said Mrs. Garrow.\n\n\u201cI think I understand the whole,\u201d said the Major; \u201cand in such a matter\nas this I will not give you counsel on either side.  But you must\nremember that in making up your mind, you must think of him as well as of\nyourself.  If you do not love him;\u2014if you feel that as his wife you\nshould not love him, there is not another word to be said.  I need not\nexplain to my daughter that under such circumstances she would be wrong\nto encourage the visits of a suitor.  But your mother says you do love\nhim.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not ask you.  But if you do;\u2014if you have so told him, and allowed\nhim to build up an idea of his life-happiness on such telling, you will,\nI think, sin greatly against him by allowing a false feminine pride to\nmar his happiness.  When once a girl has confessed to a man that she\nloves him, the confession and the love together put upon her the burden\nof a duty towards him, which she cannot with impunity throw aside.\u201d  Then\nhe kissed her, and bidding her give him a reply on the morning of the new\nyear, left her with her mother.\n\nShe had four days for consideration, and they went past her by no means\neasily.  Could she have been alone with her mother, the struggle would\nnot have been so painful; but there was the necessity that she should\ntalk to Isabella Holmes, and the necessity also that she should not\nneglect the Coverdales.  Nothing could have been kinder than Bella.  She\ndid not speak on the subject till the morning of the last day, and then\nonly in a very few words.  \u201cBessy,\u201d she said, \u201cas you are great, be\nmerciful.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I am not great, and it would not be mercy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs to that,\u201d said Bella, \u201che has surely a right to his own opinion.\u201d\n\nOn that evening she was sitting alone in her room when her mother came to\nher, and her eyes were red with weeping.  Pen and paper were before her,\nas though she were resolved to write, but hitherto no word had been\nwritten.\n\n\u201cWell, Bessy,\u201d said her mother, sitting down close beside her; \u201cis the\ndeed done?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat deed, mamma?  Who says that I am to do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe deed is not the writing, but the resolution to write.  Five words\nwill be sufficient,\u2014if only those five words may be written.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is for one\u2019s whole life, mamma.  For his life, as well as my own.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue, Bessy;\u2014that is quite true.  But equally true whether you bid him\ncome or allow him to remain away.  That task of making up one\u2019s mind for\nlife, must at last be done in some special moment of that life.\u201d\n\n\u201cMamma, mamma; tell me what I should do.\u201d\n\nBut this Mrs. Garrow would not do.  \u201cI will write the words for you if\nyou like,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it is you who must resolve that they shall be\nwritten.  I cannot bid my darling go away and leave me for another\nhome;\u2014I can only say that in my heart I do believe that home would be a\nhappy one.\u201d\n\nIt was morning before the note was written, but when the morning came\nBessy had written it and brought it to her mother.\n\n\u201cYou must take it to papa,\u201d she said.  Then she went and hid herself from\nall eyes till the noon had passed.  \u201cDear Godfrey,\u201d the letter ran, \u201cPapa\nsays that you will return on Wednesday if I write to ask you.  Do come\nback to us,\u2014if you wish it.  Yours always, Bessy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is as good as though she had filled the sheet,\u201d said the Major.  But\nin sending it to Godfrey Holmes, he did not omit a few accompanying\nremarks of his own.\n\nAn answer came from Godfrey by return of post; and on the afternoon of\nthe sixth of January, Frank Garrow drove over to the station at Penrith\nto meet him.  On their way back to Thwaite Hall there grew up a very\nclose confidence between the two future brothers-in-law, and Frank\nexplained with great perspicuity a little plan which he had arranged\nhimself.  \u201cAs soon as it is dark, so that she won\u2019t see it, Harry will\nhang it up in the dining-room,\u201d he said, \u201cand mind you go in there before\nyou go anywhere else.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very glad you have come back, Godfrey,\u201d said the Major, meeting him\nin the hall.\n\n\u201cGod bless you, dear Godfrey,\u201d said Mrs. Garrow, \u201cyou will find Bessy in\nthe dining-room,\u201d she whispered; but in so whispering she was quite\nunconscious of the mistletoe bough.\n\nAnd so also was Bessy, nor do I think that she was much more conscious\nwhen that introduction was over.  Godfrey had made all manner of promises\nto Frank, but when the moment arrived, he had found the moment too\nimportant for any special reference to the little bough above his head.\nNot so, however, Patty Coverdale.  \u201cIt\u2019s a shame,\u201d said she, bursting out\nof the room, \u201cand if I\u2019d known what you had done, nothing on earth should\nhave induced me to go in.  I won\u2019t enter the room till I know that you\nhave taken it out.\u201d  Nevertheless her sister Kate was bold enough to\nsolve the mystery before the evening was over.\n\n\n\n",
