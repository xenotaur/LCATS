My former sad\nexperience, as you know, has gifted me with some degree of insight into\nthe gloomy mysteries of the human heart, through which I have wandered\nlike one astray in a dark cavern, with his torch fast flickering to\nextinction. But this man, this class of men, is a hopeless puzzle.”\n\n“Well, but propound him,” said the sculptor. “Let us have an idea of\nhint, to begin with.”\n\n“Why, indeed,” replied Roderick, “he is such a being as I could\nconceive you to carve out of marble, and some yet unrealized perfection\nof human science to endow with an exquisite mockery of intellect; but\nstill there lacks the last inestimable touch of a divine Creator. He\nlooks like a man; and, perchance, like a better specimen of man than\nyou ordinarily meet. You might esteem him wise; he is capable of\ncultivation and refinement, and has at least an external conscience;\nbut the demands that spirit makes upon spirit are precisely those to\nwhich he cannot respond. When at last you come close to him you find\nhim chill and unsubstantial,—a mere vapor.”\n\n“I believe,” said Rosina, “I have a glimmering idea of what you mean.”\n\n“Then be thankful,” answered her husband, smiling; “but do not\nanticipate any further illumination from what I am about to read. I\nhave here imagined such a man to be—what, probably, he never\nis—conscious of the deficiency in his spiritual organization. Methinks\nthe result would be a sense of cold unreality wherewith he would go\nshivering through the world, longing to exchange his load of ice for\nany burden of real grief that fate could fling upon a human being.”\n\nContenting himself with this preface, Roderick began to read.\n\n\nIn a certain old gentleman’s last will and testament there appeared a\nbequest, which, as his final thought and deed, was singularly in\nkeeping with a long life of melancholy eccentricity. He devised a\nconsiderable sum for establishing a fund, the interest of which was to\nbe expended, annually forever, in preparing a Christmas Banquet for ten\nof the most miserable persons that could be found. It seemed not to be\nthe testator’s purpose to make these half a score of sad hearts merry,\nbut to provide that the stern or fierce expression of human discontent\nshould not be drowned, even for that one holy and joyful day, amid the\nacclamations of festal gratitude which all Christendom sends up. And he\ndesired, likewise, to perpetuate his own remonstrance against the\nearthly course of Providence, and his sad and sour dissent from those\nsystems of religion or philosophy which either find sunshine in the\nworld or draw it down from heaven.\n\nThe task of inviting the guests, or of selecting among such as might\nadvance their claims to partake of this dismal hospitality, was\nconfided to the two trustees or stewards of the fund. These gentlemen,\nlike their deceased friend, were sombre humorists, who made it their\nprincipal occupation to number the sable threads in the web of human\nlife, and drop all the golden ones out of the reckoning. They performed\ntheir present office with integrity and judgment. The aspect of the\nassembled company, on the day of the first festival, might not, it is\ntrue, have satisfied every beholder that these were especially the\nindividuals, chosen forth from all the world, whose griefs were worthy\nto stand as indicators of the mass of human suffering. Yet, after due\nconsideration, it could not be disputed that here was a variety of\nhopeless discomfort, which, if it sometimes arose from causes\napparently inadequate, was thereby only the shrewder imputation against\nthe nature and mechanism of life.\n\nThe arrangements and decorations of the banquet were probably intended\nto signify that death in life which had been the testator’s definition\nof existence. The hall, illuminated by torches, was hung round with\ncurtains of deep and dusky purple, and adorned with branches of cypress\nand wreaths of artificial flowers, imitative of such as used to be\nstrewn over the dead. A sprig of parsley was laid by every plate. The\nmain reservoir of wine, was a sepulchral urn of silver, whence the\nliquor was distributed around the table in small vases, accurately\ncopied from those that held the tears of ancient mourners. Neither had\nthe stewards—if it were their taste that arranged these\ndetails—forgotten the fantasy of the old Egyptians, who seated a\nskeleton at every festive board, and mocked their own merriment with\nthe imperturbable grin of a death’s-head. Such a fearful guest,\nshrouded in a black mantle, sat now at the head of the table. It was\nwhispered, I know not with what truth, that the testator himself had\nonce walked the visible world with the machinery of that sane skeleton,\nand that it was one of the stipulations of his will, that he should\nthus be permitted to sit, from year to year, at the banquet which he\nhad instituted. If so, it was perhaps covertly implied that he had\ncherished no hopes of bliss beyond the grave to compensate for the\nevils which he felt or imagined here. And if, in their bewildered\nconjectures as to the purpose of earthly existence, the banqueters\nshould throw aside the veil, and cast an inquiring glance at this\nfigure of death, as seeking thence the solution otherwise unattainable,\nthe only reply would be a stare of the vacant eye-caverns and a grin of\nthe skeleton jaws. Such was the response that the dead man had fancied\nhimself to receive when he asked of Death to solve the riddle of his\nlife; and it was his desire to repeat it when the guests of his dismal\nhospitality should find themselves perplexed with the same question.\n\n“What means that wreath?” asked several of the company, while viewing\nthe decorations of the table.\n\nThey alluded to a wreath of cypress, which was held on high by a\nskeleton arm, protruding from within the black mantle.\n\n“It is a crown,” said one of the stewards, “not for the worthiest, but\nfor the wofulest, when he shall prove his claim to it.”\n\nThe guest earliest bidden to the festival was a man of soft and gentle\ncharacter, who had not energy to struggle against the heavy despondency\nto which his temperament rendered him liable; and therefore with\nnothing outwardly to excuse him from happiness, he had spent a life of\nquiet misery that made his blood torpid, and weighed upon his breath,\nand sat like a ponderous night-fiend upon every throb of his\nunresisting heart. His wretchedness seemed as deep as his original\nnature, if not identical with it. It was the misfortune of a second\nguest to cherish within his bosom a diseased heart, which had become so\nwretchedly sore that the continual and unavoidable rubs of the world,\nthe blow of an enemy, the careless jostle of a stranger, and even the\nfaithful and loving touch of a friend, alike made ulcers in it. As is\nthe habit of people thus afflicted, he found his chief employment in\nexhibiting these miserable sores to any who would give themselves the\npain of viewing them. A third guest was a hypochondriac, whose\nimagination wrought necromancy in his outward and inward world, and\ncaused him to see monstrous faces in the household fire, and dragons in\nthe clouds of sunset, and fiends in the guise of beautiful women, and\nsomething ugly or wicked beneath all the pleasant surfaces of nature.\nHis neighbor at table was one who, in his early youth, had trusted\nmankind too much, and hoped too highly in their behalf, and, in meeting\nwith many disappointments, had become desperately soured. For several\nyears back this misanthrope bad employed himself in accumulating\nmotives for hating and despising his race,—such as murder, lust,\ntreachery, ingratitude, faithlessness of trusted friends, instinctive\nvices of children, impurity of women, hidden guilt in men of saint-like\naspect,—and, in short, all manner of black realities that sought to\ndecorate themselves with outward grace or glory. But at every atrocious\nfact that was added to his catalogue, at every increase of the sad\nknowledge which he spent his life to collect, the native impulses of\nthe poor man’s loving and confiding heart made him groan with anguish.\nNext, with his heavy brow bent downward, there stole into the hall a\nman naturally earnest and impassioned, who, from his immemorial\ninfancy, had felt the consciousness of a high message to the world;\nbut, essaying to deliver it, had found either no voice or form of\nspeech, or else no ears to listen. Therefore his whole life was a\nbitter questioning of himself: “Why have not men acknowledged my\nmission? Am I not a self-deluding fool? What business have I on earth?\nWhere is my grave?” Throughout the festival, he quaffed frequent\ndraughts from the sepulchral urn of wine, hoping thus to quench the\ncelestial fire that tortured his own breast and could not benefit his\nrace.\n\nThen there entered, having flung away a ticket for a ball, a gay\ngallant of yesterday, who had found four or five wrinkles in his brow,\nand more gray hairs than he could well number on his head. Endowed with\nsense and feeling, he had nevertheless spent his youth in folly, but\nhad reached at last that dreary point in life where Folly quits us of\nher own accord, leaving us to make friends with Wisdom if we can. Thus,\ncold and desolate, he had come to seek Wisdom at the banquet, and\nwondered if the skeleton were she. To eke out the company, the stewards\nhad invited a distressed poet from his home in the almshouse, and a\nmelancholy idiot from the street-corner. The latter had just the\nglimmering of sense that was sufficient to make him conscious of a\nvacancy, which the poor fellow, all his life long, had mistily sought\nto fill up with intelligence, wandering up and down the streets, and\ngroaning miserably because his attempts were ineffectual. The only lady\nin the hall was one who had fallen short of absolute and perfect\nbeauty, merely by the trifling defect of a slight cast in her left eye.\nBut this blemish, minute as it was, so shocked the pure ideal of her\nsoul, rather than her vanity, that she passed her life in solitude, and\nveiled her countenance even from her own gaze. So the skeleton sat\nshrouded at one end of the table, and this poor lady at the other.\n\nOne other guest remains to be described. He was a young man of smooth\nbrow, fair cheek, and fashionable mien. So far as his exterior\ndeveloped him, he might much more suitably have found a place at some\nmerry Christmas table, than have been numbered among the blighted,\nfate-stricken, fancy-tortured set of ill-starred banqueters. Murmurs\narose among the guests as they noted, the glance of general scrutiny\nwhich the intruder threw over his companions. What had he to do among\nthem? Why did not the skeleton of the dead founder of the feast unbend\nits rattling joints, arise, and motion the unwelcome stranger from the\nboard?\n\n“Shameful!” said the morbid man, while a new ulcer broke out in his\nheart. “He comes to mock us! we shall be the jest of his tavern friends\nI—he will make a farce of our miseries, and bring it out upon the\nstage!”\n\n“O, never mind him!” said the hypochondriac, smiling sourly. “He shall\nfeast from yonder tureen of viper-soup; and if there is a fricassee of\nscorpions on the table, pray let him have his share of it. For the\ndessert, he shall taste the apples of Sodom, then, if he like our\nChristmas fare, let him return again next year!”\n\n“Trouble him not,” murmured the melancholy man, with gentleness. “What\nmatters it whether the consciousness of misery come a few years sooner\nor later? If this youth deem himself happy now, yet let him sit with us\nfor the sake of the wretchedness to come.”\n\nThe poor idiot approached the young man with that mournful aspect of\nvacant inquiry which his face continually wore, and which caused people\nto say that he was always in search of his missing wits. After no\nlittle examination he touched the stranger’s hand, but immediately drew\nback his own, shaking his head and shivering.\n\n“Cold, cold, cold!” muttered the idiot.\n\nThe young man shivered too, and smiled.\n\n“Gentlemen, and you, madam,” said one of the stewards of the festival,\n“do not conceive so ill either of our caution or judgment, as to\nimagine that we have admitted this young stranger—Gervayse Hastings by\nname—without a full investigation and thoughtful balance of his claims.\nTrust me, not a guest at the table is better entitled to his seat.”\n\nThe steward’s guaranty was perforce satisfactory. The company,\ntherefore, took their places, and addressed themselves to the serious\nbusiness of the feast, but were soon disturbed by the hypochondriac,\nwho thrust back his chair, complaining that a dish of stewed toads and\nvipers was set before him, and that there was green ditchwater in his\ncup of wine. This mistake being amended, he quietly resumed his seat.\nThe wine, as it flowed freely from the sepulchral urn, seemed to come\nimbued with all gloomy inspirations; so that its influence was not to\ncheer, but either to sink the revellers into a deeper melancholy, or\nelevate their spirits to an enthusiasm of wretchedness. The\nconversation was various. They told sad stories about people who might\nhave been Worthy guests at such a festival as the present. They talked\nof grisly incidents in human history; of strange crimes, which, if\ntruly considered, were but convulsions of agony; of some lives that had\nbeen altogether wretched, and of others, which, wearing a general\nsemblance of happiness, had yet been deformed, sooner or later, by\nmisfortune, as by the intrusion of a grim face at a banquet; of\ndeath-bed scenes, and what dark intimations might be gathered from the\nwords of dying men; of suicide, and whether the more eligible mode were\nby halter, knife, poison, drowning, gradual starvation, or the fumes of\ncharcoal. The majority of the guests, as is the custom with people\nthoroughly and profoundly sick at heart, were anxious to make their own\nwoes the theme of discussion, and prove themselves most excellent in\nanguish. The misanthropist went deep into the philosophy of evil, and\nwandered about in the darkness, with now and then a gleam of discolored\nlight hovering on ghastly shapes and horrid scenery. Many a miserable\nthought, such as men have stumbled upon from age to age, did he now\nrake up again, and gloat over it as an inestimable gem, a diamond, a\ntreasure far preferable to those bright, spiritual revelations of a\nbetter world, which are like precious stones from heaven’s pavement.\nAnd then, amid his lore of wretchedness he hid his face and wept.\n\nIt was a festival at which the woful man of Uz might suitably have been\na guest, together with all, in each succeeding age, who have tasted\ndeepest of the bitterness of life. And be it said, too, that every son\nor daughter of woman, however favored with happy fortune, might, at one\nsad moment or another, have claimed the privilege of a stricken heart,\nto sit down at this table. But, throughout the feast, it was remarked\nthat the young stranger, Gervayse Hastings, was unsuccessful in his\nattempts to catch its pervading spirit. At any deep, strong thought\nthat found utterance, and which was torn out, as it were, from the\nsaddest recesses of human consciousness, he looked mystified and\nbewildered; even more than the poor idiot, who seemed to grasp at such\nthings with his earnest heart, and thus occasionally to comprehend\nthem. The young man’s conversation was of a colder and lighter kind,\noften brilliant, but lacking the powerful characteristics of a nature\nthat had been developed by suffering.\n\n“Sir,” said the misanthropist, bluntly, in reply to some observation by\nGervayse Hastings, “pray do not address me again. We have no right to\ntalk together. Our minds have nothing in common. By what claim you\nappear at this banquet I cannot guess; but methinks, to a man who could\nsay what you have just now said, my companions and myself must seem no\nmore than shadows flickering on the wall. And precisely such a shadow\nare you to us.”\n\nThe young man smiled and bowed, but, drawing himself back in his chair,\nhe buttoned his coat over his breast, as if the banqueting-ball were\ngrowing chill. Again the idiot fixed his melancholy stare upon the\nyouth, and murmured, “Cold! cold! cold!”\n\nThe banquet drew to its conclusion, and the guests departed. Scarcely\nhad they stepped across the threshold of the hall, when the scene that\nhad there passed seemed like the vision of a sick fancy, or an\nexhalation from a stagnant heart. Now and then, however, during the\nyear that ensued, these melancholy people caught glimpses of one\nanother, transient, indeed, but enough to prove that they walked the\nearth with the ordinary allotment of reality. Sometimes a pair of them\ncame face to face, while stealing through the evening twilight,\nenveloped in their sable cloaks. Sometimes they casually met in\nchurchyards. Once, also, it happened that two of the dismal banqueters\nmutually started at recognizing each other in the noonday sunshine of a\ncrowded street, stalking there like ghosts astray. Doubtless they\nwondered why the skeleton did not come abroad at noonday too.\n\nBut whenever the necessity of their affairs compelled these Christmas\nguests into the bustling world, they were sure to encounter the young\nman who had so unaccountably been admitted to the festival. They saw\nhim among the gay and fortunate; they caught the sunny sparkle of his\neye; they heard the light and careless tones of his voice, and muttered\nto themselves with such indignation as only the aristocracy of\nwretchedness could kindle, “The traitor! The vile impostor! Providence,\nin its own good time, may give him a right to feast among us!” But the\nyoung man’s unabashed eye dwelt upon their gloomy figures as they\npassed him, seeming to say, perchance with somewhat of a sneer, “First,\nknow my secret then, measure your claims with mine!”\n\nThe step of Time stole onward, and soon brought merry Christmas round\nagain, with glad and solemn worship in the churches, and sports, games,\nfestivals, and everywhere the bright face of Joy beside the household\nfire. Again likewise the hall, with its curtains of dusky purple, was\nilluminated by the death-torches gleaming on the sepulchral decorations\nof the banquet. The veiled, skeleton sat in state, lifting the\ncypress-wreath above its head, as the guerdon of some guest illustrious\nin the qualifications which there claimed precedence. As the stewards\ndeemed the world inexhaustible in misery, and were desirous of\nrecognizing it in all its forms, they had not seen fit to reassemble\nthe company of the former year. New faces now threw their gloom across\nthe table.\n\nThere was a man of nice conscience, who bore a blood-stain in his\nheart—the death of a fellow-creature—which, for his more exquisite\ntorture, had chanced with such a peculiarity of circumstances, that he\ncould not absolutely determine whether his will had entered into the\ndeed or not. Therefore, his whole life was spent in the agony of an\ninward trial for murder, with a continual sifting of the details of his\nterrible calamity, until his mind had no longer any thought, nor his\nsoul any emotion, disconnected with it, There was a mother, too,—a\nmother once, but a desolation now,—who, many years before, had gone out\non a pleasure-party, and, returning, found her infant smothered in its\nlittle bed. And ever since she has been tortured with the fantasy that\nher buried baby lay smothering in its coffin. Then there was an aged\nlady, who had lived from time immemorial with a constant tremor\nquivering through her-frame. It was terrible to discern her dark shadow\ntremulous upon the wall; her lips, likewise, were tremulous; and the\nexpression of her eye seemed to indicate that her soul was trembling\ntoo. Owing to the bewilderment and confusion which made almost a chaos\nof her intellect, it was impossible to discover what dire misfortune\nhad thus shaken her nature to its depths; so that the stewards had\nadmitted her to the table, not from any acquaintance with her history,\nbut on the safe testimony of her miserable aspect. Some surprise was\nexpressed at the presence of a bluff, red-faced gentleman, a certain\nMr. Smith, who had evidently the fat of many a rich feast within him,\nand the habitual twinkle of whose eye betrayed a disposition to break\nforth into uproarious laughter for little cause or none. It turned out,\nhowever, that, with the best possible flow of spirits, our poor friend\nwas afflicted with a physical disease of the heart, which threatened\ninstant death on the slightest cachinnatory indulgence, or even that\ntitillation of the bodily frame produced by merry thoughts. In this\ndilemma he had sought admittance to the banquet, on the ostensible plea\nof his irksome and miserable state, but, in reality, with the hope of\nimbibing a life-preserving melancholy.\n\nA married couple had been invited from a motive of bitter humor, it\nbeing well understood that they rendered each other unutterably\nmiserable whenever they chanced to meet, and therefore must necessarily\nbe fit associates at the festival. In contrast with these was another\ncouple still unmarried, who had interchanged their hearts in early\nlife, but had been divided by circumstances as impalpable as morning\nmist, and kept apart so long that their spirits now found it impossible\nto meet, Therefore, yearning for communion, yet shrinking from one\nanother and choosing none beside, they felt themselves companionless in\nlife, and looked upon eternity as a boundless desert. Next to the\nskeleton sat a mere son of earth,—a hunter of the Exchange,—a gatherer\nof shining dust,—a man whose life’s record was in his ledger, and whose\nsoul’s prison-house the vaults of the bank where he kept his deposits.\nThis person had been greatly perplexed at his invitation, deeming\nhimself one of the most fortunate men in the city; but the stewards\npersisted in demanding his presence, assuring him that he had no\nconception how miserable he was.\n\nAnd now appeared a figure which we must acknowledge as our acquaintance\nof the former festival. It was Gervayse Hastings, whose presence had\nthen caused so much question and criticism, and who now took his place\nwith the composure of one whose claims were satisfactory to himself and\nmust needs be allowed by others. Yet his easy and unruffled face\nbetrayed no sorrow.\n\nThe well-skilled beholders gazed a moment into his eyes and shook their\nheads, to miss the unuttered sympathy—the countersign never to be\nfalsified—of those whose hearts are cavern-mouths through which they\ndescend into a region of illimitable woe and recognize other wanderers\nthere.\n\n“Who is this youth?” asked the man with a bloodstain on his conscience.\n“Surely he has never gone down into the depths! I know all the aspects\nof those who have passed through the dark valley. By what right is he\namong us?”\n\n“Ah, it is a sinful thing to come hither without a sorrow,” murmured\nthe aged lady, in accents that partook of the eternal tremor which\npervaded her whole being “Depart, young man! Your soul has never been\nshaken, and, therefore, I tremble so much the more to look at you.”\n\n“His soul shaken! No; I’ll answer for it,” said bluff Mr. Smith,\npressing his hand upon his heart and making himself as melancholy as he\ncould, for fear of a fatal explosion of laughter. “I know the lad well;\nhe has as fair prospects as any young man about town, and has no more\nright among us miserable creatures than the child unborn. He never was\nmiserable and probably never will be!”\n\n“Our honored guests,” interposed the stewards, “pray have patience with\nus, and believe, at least, that our deep veneration for the sacredness\nof this solemnity would preclude any wilful violation of it. Receive\nthis young man to your table. It may not be too much to say, that no\nguest here would exchange his own heart for the one that beats within\nthat youthful bosom!”\n\n“I’d call it a bargain, and gladly, too,” muttered Mr. Smith, with a\nperplexing mixture of sadness and mirthful conceit. “A plague upon\ntheir nonsense! My own heart is the only really miserable one in the\ncompany; it will certainly be the death of me at last!”\n\nNevertheless, as on the former occasion, the judgment of the stewards\nbeing without appeal, the company sat down. The obnoxious guest made no\nmore attempt to obtrude his conversation on those about him, but\nappeared to listen to the table-talk with peculiar assiduity, as if\nsome inestimable secret, otherwise beyond his reach, might be conveyed\nin a casual word. And in truth, to those who could understand and value\nit, there was rich matter in the upgushings and outpourings of these\ninitiated souls to whom sorrow had been a talisman, admitting them into\nspiritual depths which no other spell can open. Sometimes out of the\nmidst of densest gloom there flashed a momentary radiance, pure as\ncrystal, bright as the flame of stars, and shedding such a glow upon\nthe mysteries of life, that the guests were ready to exclaim, “Surely\nthe riddle is on the point of being solved!” At such illuminated\nintervals the saddest mourners felt it to be revealed that mortal\ngriefs are but shadowy and external; no more than the sable robes\nvoluminously shrouding a certain divine reality, and thus indicating\nwhat might otherwise be altogether invisible to mortal eye.\n\n“Just now,” remarked the trembling old woman, “I seemed to see beyond\nthe outside. And then my everlasting tremor passed away!”\n\n“Would that I could dwell always in these momentary gleams of light!”\nsaid the man of stricken conscience. “Then the blood-stain in my heart\nwould be washed clean away.”\n\nThis strain of conversation appeared so unintelligibly absurd to good\nMr. Smith, that he burst into precisely the fit of laughter which his\nphysicians had warned him against, as likely to prove instantaneously\nfatal. In effect, he fell back in his chair a corpse, with a broad grin\nupon his face, while his ghost, perchance, remained beside it\nbewildered at its unpremeditated exit. This catastrophe of course broke\nup the festival.\n\n“How is this? You do not tremble!” observed the tremulous old woman to\nGervayse Hastings, who was gazing at the dead man with singular\nintentness. “Is it not awful to see him so suddenly vanish out of the\nmidst of life,—this man of flesh and blood, whose earthly nature was so\nwarm and strong? There is a never-ending tremor in my soul, but it\ntrembles afresh at, this! And you are calm!”\n\n“Would that he could teach me somewhat!” said Gervayse Hastings,\ndrawing a long breath. “Men pass before me like shadows on the wall;\ntheir actions, passions, feelings, are flickerings of the light, and\nthen they vanish! Neither the corpse, nor yonder skeleton, nor this old\nwoman’s everlasting tremor, can give me what I seek.”\n\nAnd then the company departed.\n\nWe cannot linger to narrate, in such detail, more circumstances of\nthese singular festivals, which, in accordance with the founder’s will,\ncontinued to be kept with the regularity of an established institution.\nIn process of time the stewards adopted the custom of inviting, from\nfar and near, those individuals whose misfortunes were prominent above\nother men’s, and whose mental and moral development might, therefore,\nbe supposed to possess a corresponding interest. The exiled noble of\nthe French Revolution, and the broken soldier of the Empire, were alike\nrepresented at the table. Fallen monarchs, wandering about the earth,\nhave found places at that forlorn and miserable feast. The statesman,\nwhen his party flung him off, might, if he chose it, be once more a\ngreat man for the space of a single banquet. Aaron Burr’s name appears\non the record at a period when his ruin—the profoundest and most\nstriking, with more of moral circumstance in it than that of almost any\nother man—was complete in his lonely age. Stephen Guard, when his\nwealth weighed upon him like a mountain, once sought admittance of his\nown accord. It is not probable, however, that these men had any lesson\nto teach in the lore of discontent and misery which might not equally\nwell have been studied in the common walks of life. Illustrious\nunfortunates attract a wider sympathy, not because their griefs are\nmore intense, but because, being set on lofty pedestals, they the\nbetter serve mankind as instances and bywords of calamity.\n\nIt concerns our present purpose to say that, at each successive\nfestival, Gervayse Hastings showed his face, gradually changing from\nthe smooth beauty of his youth to the thoughtful comeliness of manhood,\nand thence to the bald, impressive dignity of age. He was the only\nindividual invariably present. Yet on every occasion there were\nmurmurs, both from those who knew his character and position, and from\nthem whose hearts shrank back as denying his companionship in their\nmystic fraternity.\n\n“Who is this impassive man?” had been asked a hundred times. “Has he\nsuffered? Has he sinned? There are no traces of either. Then wherefore\nis he here?”\n\n“You must inquire of the stewards or of himself,” was the constant\nreply. “We seem to know him well here in our city, and know nothing of\nhim but what is creditable and fortunate. Yet hither he comes, year\nafter year, to this gloomy banquet, and sits among the guests like a\nmarble statue. Ask yonder skeleton, perhaps that may solve the riddle!”\n\nIt was in truth a wonder. The life of Gervayse Hastings was not merely\na prosperous, but a brilliant one. Everything had gone well with him.\nHe was wealthy, far beyond the expenditure that was required by habits\nof magnificence, a taste of rare purity and cultivation, a love of\ntravel, a scholar’s instinct to collect a splendid library, and,\nmoreover, what seemed a magnificent liberality to the distressed. He\nhad sought happiness, and not vainly, if a lovely and tender wife, and\nchildren of fair promise, could insure it. He had, besides, ascended\nabove the limit which separates the obscure from the distinguished, and\nhad won a stainless reputation in affairs of the widest public\nimportance. Not that he was a popular character, or had within him the\nmysterious attributes which are essential to that species of success.\nTo the public he was a cold abstraction, wholly destitute of those rich\nlines of personality, that living warmth, and the peculiar faculty of\nstamping his own heart’s impression on a multitude of hearts, by which\nthe people recognize their favorites. And it must be owned that, after\nhis most intimate associates had done their best to know him\nthoroughly, and love him warmly, they were startled to find how little\nhold he had upon their affections. They approved, they admired, but\nstill in those moments when the human spirit most craves reality, they\nshrank back from Gervayse Hastings, as powerless to give them what they\nsought. It was the feeling of distrustful regret with which we should\ndraw back the hand after extending it, in an illusive twilight, to\ngrasp the hand of a shadow upon the wall.\n\nAs the superficial fervency of youth decayed, this peculiar effect of\nGervayse Hastings’s character grew more perceptible. His children, when\nhe extended his arms, came coldly to his knees, but never climbed them\nof their own accord. His wife wept secretly, and almost adjudged\nherself a criminal because she shivered in the chill of his bosom. He,\ntoo, occasionally appeared not unconscious of the chillness of his\nmoral atmosphere, and willing, if it might be so, to warm himself at a\nkindly fire. But age stole onward and benumbed him snore and more. As\nthe hoar-frost began to gather on him his wife went to her grave, and\nwas doubtless warmer there; his children either died or were scattered\nto different homes of their own; and old Gervayse Hastings, unscathed\nby grief,—alone, but needing no companionship,—continued his steady\nwalk through life, and still one very Christmas day attended at the\ndismal banquet. His privilege as a guest had become prescriptive now.\nHad he claimed the head of the table, even the skeleton would have been\nejected from its seat.\n\nFinally, at the merry Christmas-tide, when he had numbered fourscore\nyears complete, this pale, highbrowed, marble-featured old man once\nmore entered the long-frequented hall, with the same impassive aspect\nthat had called forth so much dissatisfied remark at his first\nattendance. Time, except in matters merely external, had done nothing\nfor him, either of good or evil. As he took his place he threw a calm,\ninquiring glance around the table, as if to ascertain whether any guest\nhad yet appeared, after so many unsuccessful banquets, who might impart\nto him the mystery—the deep, warm secret—the life within the\nlife—which, whether manifested in joy or sorrow, is what gives\nsubstance to a world of shadows.\n\n“My friends,” said Gervayse Hastings, assuming a position which his\nlong conversance with the festival caused to appear natural, “you are\nwelcome! I drink to you all in this cup of sepulchral wine.”\n\nThe guests replied courteously, but still in a manner that proved them\nunable to receive the old man as a member of their sad fraternity. It\nmay be well to give the reader an idea of the present company at the\nbanquet.\n\nOne was formerly a clergyman, enthusiastic in his profession, and\napparently of the genuine dynasty of those old Puritan divines whose\nfaith in their calling, and stern exercise of it, had placed them among\nthe mighty of the earth. But yielding to the speculative tendency of\nthe age, he had gone astray from the firm foundation of an ancient\nfaith, and wandered into a cloud-region, where everything was misty and\ndeceptive, ever mocking him with a semblance of reality, but still\ndissolving when he flung himself upon it for support and rest. His\ninstinct and early training demanded something steadfast; but, looking\nforward, he beheld vapors piled on vapors, and behind him an impassable\ngulf between the man of yesterday and to-day, on the borders of which\nhe paced to and fro, sometimes wringing his hands in agony, and often\nmaking his own woe a theme of scornful merriment. This surely was a\nmiserable man. Next, there was a theorist,—one of a numerous tribe,\nalthough he deemed himself unique since the creation,—a theorist, who\nhad conceived a plan by which all the wretchedness of earth, moral and\nphysical, might be done away, and the bliss of the millennium at once\naccomplished. But, the incredulity of mankind debarring him from\naction, he was smitten with as much grief as if the whole mass of woe\nwhich he was denied the opportunity to remedy were crowded into his own\nbosom. A plain old man in black attracted much of the company’s notice,\non the supposition that he was no other than Father Miller, who, it\nseemed, had given himself up to despair at the tedious delay of the\nfinal conflagration. Then there was a man distinguished for native\npride and obstinacy, who, a little while before, had possessed immense\nwealth, and held the control of a vast moneyed interest which he had\nwielded in the same spirit as a despotic monarch would wield the power\nof his empire, carrying on a tremendous moral warfare, the roar and\ntremor of which was felt at every fireside in the land. At length came\na crushing ruin,—a total overthrow of fortune, power, and\ncharacter,—the effect of which on his imperious and, in many respects,\nnoble and lofty nature might have entitled him to a place, not merely\nat our festival, but among the peers of Pandemonium.\n\nThere was a modern philanthropist, who had become so deeply sensible of\nthe calamities of thousands and millions of his fellow-creatures, and\nof the impracticableness of any general measures for their relief, that\nhe had no heart to do what little good lay immediately within his\npower, but contented himself with being miserable for sympathy. Near\nhim sat a gentleman in a predicament hitherto unprecedented, but of\nwhich the present epoch probably affords numerous examples. Ever since\nhe was of capacity to read a newspaper, this person had prided himself\non his consistent adherence to one political party, but, in the\nconfusion of these latter days, had got bewildered and knew not\nwhereabouts his party was. This wretched condition, so morally desolate\nand disheartening to a man who has long accustomed himself to merge his\nindividuality in the mass of a great body, can only be conceived by\nsuch as have experienced it. His next companion was a popular orator\nwho had lost his voice, and—as it was pretty much all that he had to\nlose—had fallen into a state of hopeless melancholy. The table was\nlikewise graced by two of the gentler sex,—one, a half-starved,\nconsumptive seamstress, the representative of thousands just as\nwretched; the other, a woman of unemployed energy, who found herself in\nthe world with nothing to achieve, nothing to enjoy, and nothing even\nto suffer. She had, therefore, driven herself to the verge of madness\nby dark broodings over the wrongs of her sex, and its exclusion from a\nproper field of action. The roll of guests being thus complete, a\nside-table had been set for three or four disappointed office-seekers,\nwith hearts as sick as death, whom the stewards had admitted partly\nbecause their calamities really entitled them to entrance here, and\npartly that they were in especial need of a good dinner. There was\nlikewise a homeless dog, with his tail between his legs, licking up the\ncrumbs and gnawing the fragments of the feast,—such a melancholy cur as\none sometimes sees about the streets without a master, and willing to\nfollow the first that will accept his service.\n\nIn their own way, these were as wretched a set of people as ever had\nassembled at the festival. There they sat, with the veiled skeleton of\nthe founder holding aloft the cypress-wreath, at one end of the table,\nand at the other, wrapped in furs, the withered figure of Gervayse\nHastings, stately, calm, and cold, impressing the company with awe, yet\nso little interesting their sympathy that he might have vanished into\nthin air without their once exclaiming, “Whither is he gone?”\n\n“Sir,” said the philanthropist, addressing the old man, “you have been\nso long a guest at this annual festival, and have thus been conversant\nwith so many varieties of human affliction, that, not improbably, you\nhave thence derived some great and important lessons. How blessed were\nyour lot could you reveal a secret by which all this mass of woe might\nbe removed!”\n\n“I know of but one misfortune,” answered Gervayse Hastings, quietly,\n“and that is my own.”\n\n“Your own!” rejoined the philanthropist. “And looking back on your\nserene and prosperous life, how can you claim to be the sole\nunfortunate of the human race?”\n\n“You will not understand it,” replied Gervayse Hastings, feebly, and\nwith a singular inefficiency of pronunciation, and sometimes putting\none word for another. “None have understood it, not even those who\nexperience the like. It is a chillness, a want of earnestness, a\nfeeling as if what should be my heart were a thing of vapor, a haunting\nperception of unreality! Thus seeming to possess all that other men\nhave, all that men aim at, I have really possessed nothing, neither joy\nnor griefs. All things, all persons,—as was truly said to me at this\ntable long and long ago,—have been like shadows flickering on the wall.\nIt was so with my wife and children, with those who seemed my friends:\nit is so with yourselves, whom I see now before one. Neither have I\nmyself any real existence, but am a shadow like the rest.”\n\n“And how is it with your views of a future life?” inquired the\nspeculative clergyman.\n\n“Worse than with you,” said the old man, in a hollow and feeble tone;\n“for I cannot conceive it earnestly enough to feel either hope or fear.\nMine,—mine is the wretchedness! This cold heart,—this unreal life! Ah!\nit grows colder still.”\n\nIt so chanced that at this juncture the decayed ligaments of the\nskeleton gave way, and the dry hones fell together in a heap, thus\ncausing the dusty wreath of cypress to drop upon the table. The\nattention of the company being thus diverted for a single instant from\nGervayse Hastings, they perceived, on turning again towards him, that\nthe old man had undergone a change. His shadow had ceased to flicker on\nthe wall.\n\n\n“Well, Rosina, what is your criticism?” asked Roderick, as he rolled up\nthe manuscript.\n\n“Frankly, your success is by no means complete,” replied she. “It is\ntrue, I have an idea of the character you endeavor to describe; but it\nis rather by dint of my own thought than your expression.”\n\n“That is unavoidable,” observed the sculptor, “because the\ncharacteristics are all negative. If Gervayse Hastings could have\nimbibed one human grief at the gloomy banquet, the task of describing\nhim would have been infinitely easier. Of such persons—and we do meet\nwith these moral monsters now and then—it is difficult to conceive how\nthey came to exist here, or what there is in them capable of existence\nhereafter. They seem to be on the outside of everything; and nothing\nwearies the soul more than an attempt to comprehend them within its\ngrasp.”\n\n\n\n",
