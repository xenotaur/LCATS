McALPIN, ESQUIRE,\n\nWHO KNOWS A LOT\n\nABOUT EATING\n\n\n\n\nNo Red Meats, but Only Sea Foods. _Frontispiece_\n\n\"Herb, Stand Back! Stand Well Back to Avoid Being Splashed!\"\n\nHalf a Dozen Times a Night or Oftener He Travelled under Escort\nthrough the Room\n\n\n\n\n_Eating in Two or Three Languages_\n\n\nOn my way home from overseas I spent many happy hours mapping out a\ncampaign. To myself I said: \"The day I land is going to be a great day\nfor some of the waiters and a hard day on some of the cooks. Persons\nwho happen to be near by when I am wrestling with my first ear of\ngreen corn will think I am playing on a mouth organ. My behaviour in\nregard to hothouse asparagus will be reminiscent of the best work of\nthe late Bosco. In the matter of cantaloupes I rather fancy I shall\nconsume the first two on the half shell, or _au naturel_, as we\nveteran correspondents say; but the third one will contain about as\nmuch vanilla ice cream as you could put in a derby hat.\n\n\"And when, as I am turning over my second piece of fried chicken, with\nVirginia ham, if H. Hoover should crawl out from under it, and,\nshaking the gravy out of his eyes, should lift a warning hand, I shall\nsay to him: 'Herb,' I shall say, 'Herb, stand back! Stand well back\nto avoid being splashed, Herb. Please desist and do not bother me now,\nfor I am busy. Kindly remember that I am but just returned from over\nthere and that for months and months past, as I went to and fro across\nthe face of the next hemisphere that you'll run into on the left of\nyou if you go just outside of Sandy Hook and take the first turn to\nthe right, I have been storing up a great, unsatisfied longing for the\nspecial dishes of my own, my native land. Don't try, I pray you, to\ntell me a patriot can't do his bit and eat it too, for I know better.\n\n\"'Shortly I may be in a fitter frame of mind to listen to your\nadmonitions touching on rationing schemes; but not to-day, and\npossibly not to-morrow either, Herb. At this moment I consider food\nregulations as having been made for slaves and perhaps for the run of\nother people; but not for me. As a matter of fact, what you may have\nobserved up until now has merely been my preliminary attack--what you\nmight call open warfare, with scouting operations. But when they\nbring on the transverse section of watermelon I shall take these two\ntrenching tools which I now hold in my hands, and just naturally start\ndigging in. I trust you may be hanging round then; you'll certainly\noverhear something.'\n\n\"'Kindly pass the ice water. That's it. Thank you. Join me, won't you,\nin a brimming beaker? It may interest you to know that I am now on my\nsecond carafe of this wholesome, delicious and satisfying beverage.\nWhere I have lately been, in certain parts of the adjacent continent,\nthere isn't any ice, and nobody by any chance ever drinks water.\nNobody bathes in it either, so far as I have been able to note. You'll\ndoubtless be interested in hearing what they do do with it over on\nthat side. It took me months to find out.\n\n\"'Then finally, one night in a remote interior village, I went to an\nentertainment in a Y.M.C.A. hut. A local magician came out on the\nplatform; and after he had done some tricks with cards and\nhandkerchiefs which were so old that they were new all over again, he\nreached up under the tails of his dress coat and hauled out a big\nglass globe that was slopping full of its crystal-pure fluid contents,\nwith a family of goldfish swimming round and round in it, as happy as\nyou please.\n\n\"'So then, all in a flash, the answer came and I knew the secret of\nwhat the provincials in that section of Europe do with water. They\nloan it to magicians to keep goldfish in. But I prefer to drink a\nlittle of it while I am eating and to eat a good deal while I am\ndrinking it; both of which, I may state, I am now doing to the best of\nmy ability, and without let or hindrance, Herb.'\"\n\nTo be exactly correct about it, I began mapping out this campaign long\nbefore I took ship for the homeward hike. The suggestion formed in my\nmind during those weeks I spent in London, when the resident\npopulation first went on the food-card system. You had to have a meat\ncard, I think, to buy raw meat in a butcher shop, and you had to have\nanother kind of meat card, I know, to get cooked meat in a\nrestaurant; and you had to have a friend who was a smuggler or a\nhoarder to get an adequate supply of sugar under any circumstances.\nBefore I left, every one was carrying round a sheaf of cards. You\ndidn't dare go fishing if you had mislaid your worm card.\n\nThe resolution having formed, it budded and grew in my mind when I was\nup near the Front gallantly exposing myself to the sort of\ntable-d'h\u00f4te dinners that were available then in some of the lesser\ntowns immediately behind the firing lines; and it kept right on\ngrowing, so that by the time I was ready to sail it was full sized. En\nroute, I thought up an interchangeable answer for two of the oldest\nconundrums of my childhood, one of them being: \"Round as a biscuit,\nbusy as a bee; busiest thing you ever did see,\" and the other, \"Opens\nlike a barn door, shuts like a trap; guess all day and you can't guess\nthat.\" In the original versions the answer to the first was \"A watch,\"\nand to the second, \"A corset\"--if I recall aright But the joint\nanswer I worked out was as follows: \"My face!\"\n\nSuch was the pleasing program I figured out on shipboard. But, as is\nso frequently the case with the most pleasing things in life, I found\nthe anticipation rather outshone the realisation. Already I detect\nmyself, in a retrospective mood, hankering for the savoury _rago\u00fbts_\nwe used to get in peasant homes in obscure French villages, and for\nthe meals they gave us at the regimental messes of our own forces,\nwhere the cooking was the home sort and good honest American slang\nabounded.\n\nThey called the corned beef Canned Willie; and the stew was known\naffectionately as Slum, and the doughnuts were Fried Holes. When the\nadjutant, who had been taking French lessons, remarked \"What the _la_\nhell does that _sacr\u00e9-blew_ cook mean by serving forty-fours at every\nmeal?\" you gathered he was getting a mite tired of baked army beans.\nAnd if the lieutenant colonel asked you to pass him the Native Sons\nyou knew he meant he wanted prunes. It was a great life, if you\ndidn't weaken--and nobody did.\n\nBut, so far as the joys of the table are concerned, I think I shall be\nable to wait for quite a spell before I yearn for another whack at\nEnglish eating. I opine Charles Dickens would be a most unhappy man\ncould he but return to the scenes he loved and wrote about.\n\nDickens, as will be recalled, specialised in mouth-watering\ndescriptions of good things and typically British things to eat--roast\nsucking pigs, with apples in their snouts; and baked goose; and suety\nplum puddings like speckled cannon balls; and cold game pies as big\nround as barrel tops--and all such. He wouldn't find these things\nprevailing to any noticeable extent in his native island now. Even the\nkidney, the same being the thing for which an Englishman mainly raises\na sheep and which he always did know how to serve up better than any\none else on earth, somehow doesn't seem to be the kidney it once upon\na time was when it had the proper sorts of trimmings and sauces to go\nwith it.\n\nAt this time England is no place for the epicure. In peacetime English\ncooks, as a rule, were not what you would call versatile; their range,\nas it were, was limited. Once, seeking to be blithesome and light of\nheart, I wrote an article in which I said there were only three\ndependable vegetables on the average Englishman's everyday\nmenu--boiled potatoes, boiled cabbage, and a second helping of the\nboiled potatoes.\n\nThat was an error on my part; I was unintentionally guilty of the\ncrime of underestimation. I should have added a fourth to the list of\nstand-bys--to wit: the vegetable marrow. For some reason, possibly\nbecause they are a stubborn and tenacious race, the English persist in\nlooking upon the vegetable marrow as an object designed for human\nconsumption, which is altogether the wrong view to take of it. As a\nfoodstuff this article hasn't even the merit that attaches to stringy\ncelery. You do not derive much nourishment from stale celery, but\neating at it polishes the teeth and provides a healthful form of\nexercise that gives you an appetite for the rest of the meal.\n\nFrom the vegetable marrow you derive no nourishment, and certainly you\nderive no exercise; for, being a soft, weak, spiritless thing, it\noffers no resistance whatever, and it looks a good deal like a streak\nof solidified fog and tastes like the place where an indisposed carrot\nspent the night. Next to our summer squash it is the feeblest\nimitation that ever masqueraded in a skin and called itself a\nvegetable. Yet its friends over there seem to set much store by it.\n\nLikewise the English cook has always gone in rather extensively for\nboiling things. When in doubt she boiled. But it takes a lot of\nretouching to restore to a piece of boiled meat the juicy essences\nthat have been simmered and drenched out of it. Since the English\npeople, with such admirable English thoroughness, cut down on fats and\noils and bacon garnishments, so that the greases might be conserved\nfor the fighting forces; and since they have so largely had to do\nwithout imported spices and condiments, because the cargo spaces in\nthe ships coming in were needed for military essentials, the boiled\ndishes of England appear to have lost most of their taste.\n\nYou can do a lot of browsing about at an English table these days and\ncome away ostensibly filled; but inside you there will be a persistent\nunsatisfied feeling, all the same, which is partly due, no doubt, to\nthe lack of sweetening and partly due to the lack of fats, but due\nmost of all, I think, to a natural disappointment in the results. In\nthe old times a man didn't feel that he had dined well in England\nunless for an hour or two afterward he had the comfortable gorged\nsensation of a python full of pigeons.\n\nI shall never forget the first meals I had on English soil, this\nlatest trip. At the port where we landed, in the early afternoon of a\nraw day, you could get tea if you cared for tea, which I do not; but\nthere was no sugar--only saccharine--to sweeten it with, and no rich\ncream, or even skim milk, available with which to dilute it. The\naccompanying buns had a flat, dry, floury taste, and the portions of\nbutter served with them were very homoeopathic indeed as to size and\nvery oleomargarinish as to flavour.\n\nGoing up to London we rode in a train that was crowded and darkened.\nBrilliantly illuminated trains scooting across country offered an\nexcellent mark for the aim of hostile air raiders, you know; so in\neach compartment the gloom was enhanced rather than dissipated by two\ntiny pin points of a ghastly pale-blue gas flame. I do not know why\nthere should have been two of these lights, unless it was that the\nsecond one was added so that by its wan flickerings you could see the\nfirst one, and vice versa.\n\nDuring the trip, which lasted several hours longer than the scheduled\nrunning time, we had for refreshments a few gnarly apples, purchased\nat a way station; and that was all. Recalling the meals that formerly\nhad been served aboard the boat trains of this road, I realised I was\ngetting my preliminary dose of life on an island whose surrounding\nwaters were pestered by U-boats and whose shipping was needed for\ntransport service. But I pinned my gastronomic hopes on London, that\ncity famed of old for the plenteous prodigality of its victualling\nfacilities. In my ignorance I figured that the rigours of rationing\ncould not affect London to any very noticeable extent. A little\ntrimming down here and there, an enforced curtailment in this\ndirection and that--yes, perhaps so; but surely nothing more serious.\n\nImmediately on arrival we chartered a taxicab--a companion and I did.\nThis was not so easy a job as might be imagined by one who formed his\nopinions on past recollections of London, because, since gasoline was\ncarefully rationed there, taxis were scarce where once they had been\nnumerous. Indeed, I know of no city in which, in antebellum days,\ntaxis were so numerously distributed through almost every quarter of\nthe town as in London. At any busy corner there were almost as many\ntaxicabs waiting and ready to serve you as there are taxicabs in New\nYork whose drivers are cruising about looking for a chance to run over\nyou. The foregoing is still true of New York, but did not apply to\nLondon in war time.\n\nHaving chartered our cab, much to the chagrin of a group of our fellow\ntravellers who had wasted precious time getting their heavy luggage\nout of the van, we rode through the darkened streets to a hotel\nformerly renowned for the scope and excellence of its cuisine. We\nreached there after the expiration of the hour set apart under the\nfood regulations for serving dinner to the run of folks. But, because\nwe were both in uniform--he as a surgeon in the British Army, and I as\na correspondent--and because we had but newly finished a journey by\nrail, we were entitled, it seemed, to claim refreshment.\n\nHowever, he, as an officer, was restricted to a meal costing not to\nexceed six shillings--and six shillings never did go far in this\nhotel, even when prices were normal. Not being an officer but merely a\ncivilian disguised in the habiliments of a military man, I, on the\nother hand, was bound by no such limitations, but might go as far as I\npleased. So it was decided that I should order double portions of\neverything and surreptitiously share with him; for by now we were\nhungry to the famishing point.\n\nWe had our minds set on a steak--a large thick steak served with\nonions, Desdemona style--that is to say, smothered. It was a pretty\nthought, a passing fair conception--but a vain one.\n\n\"No steaks to-night, sir,\" said the waiter sorrowfully.\n\n\"All right, then,\" one of us said. \"How about chops--fat juicy chops?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, sir; no chops, sir,\" he told us.\n\n\"Well then, what have you in the line of red meats?\"\n\nHe was desolated to be compelled to inform us that there were no red\nmeats of any sort to be had, but only sea foods. So we started in with\noysters. Personally I have never cared deeply for the European oyster.\nIn size he is an\u00e6mic and puny as compared with his brethren of the\neastern coast of North America; and, moreover, chronically he is\nsuffering from an acute attack of brass poisoning. The only way by\nwhich a novice may distinguish a bad European oyster from a good\nEuropean oyster is by the fact that a bad one tastes slightly better\nthan a good one does. In my own experience I have found this to be the\none infallible test.\n\nWe had oysters until both of us were full of verdigris, and I, for\none, had a tang in my mouth like an antique bronze jug; and then we\nproceeded to fish. We had fillets of sole, which tasted as they\nlooked--flat and a bit flabby. Subsequently I learned that this lack\nof savour in what should be the most toothsome of all European fishes\nmight be attributed to an insufficiency of fat in the cooking; but at\nthe moment I could only believe the trip up from Dover had given the\npoor thing a touch of car sickness from which he had not recovered\nbefore he reached us.\n\nAfter that we had lobsters, half-fare size, but charged for at the\nfull adult rates. And, having by now exhausted our capacity for sea\nfoods, we wound up with an alleged dessert in the shape of three\ndrowned prunes apiece, the remains being partly immersed in a palish\ncustardlike composition that was slightly sour.\n\n\"Never mind,\" I said to my indignant stomach as we left the\ntable--\"Never mind! I shall make it all up to you for this\nmistreatment at breakfast to-morrow morning. We shall rise early--you\nand I--and with loud gurgling cries we shall leap headlong into one of\nthose regular breakfasts in which the people of this city and nation\nspecialise so delightfully. Food regulators may work their ruthless\nwill upon the dinner trimmings, but none would dare to put so much as\nthe weight of one impious finger upon an Englishman's breakfast table\nto curtail its plenitude. Why, next to Magna Charta, an Englishman's\nbreakfast is his most sacred right.\"\n\nThis in confidence was what I whispered to my gastric juices. You see,\nbeing still in ignorance of the full scope of the ration scheme in\nits application to the metropolitan district, and my disheartening\nexperience at the meal just concluded to the contrary notwithstanding,\nI had my thoughts set upon rashers of crisp Wiltshire bacon, and broad\nsegments of grilled York ham, and fried soles, and lovely plump\nsausages bursting from their jackets, and devilled kidneys paired off\non a slice of toast, like Noah and his wife crossing the gangplank\ninto the Ark.\n\nNeed I prolong the pain of my disclosures by longer withholding the\ndistressing truth that breakfast next morning was a failure too? To\nbegin with, I couldn't get any of those lovely crisp crescent rolls\nthat accord so rhythmically with orange marmalade and strawberry jam.\nI couldn't get hot buttered toast either, but only some thin hard\nslabs of war bread, which seemingly had been dry-cured in a kiln. I\ncould have but a very limited amount of sugar--a mere pinch, in fact;\nand if I used it to tone up my coffee there would be none left for\noatmeal porridge. Moreover, this dab of sugar was to be my full day's\nallowance, it seemed. There was no cream for the porridge either, but,\ninstead, a small measure of skimmed milk so pale in colour that it had\nthe appearance of having been diluted with moonbeams.\n\nFurthermore, I was informed that prior to nine-thirty I could have no\nmeat of any sort, the only exceptions to this cruel rule being\nkippered herrings and bloaters; and in strict confidence the waiter\nwarned me that, for some mysterious reason, neither the kippers nor\nthe bloaters seemed to be up to their oldtime mark of excellence just\nnow. From the same source I gathered that it would be highly\ninadvisable to order fried eggs, because of the lack of sufficient fat\nin which to cook them. So, as a last resort, I ordered two eggs,\nsoft-boiled. They were served upended, English-fashion, in little\nindividual cups, the theory being that in turn I should neatly scalp\nthe top off of each egg with my spoon and then scoop out the contents\nfrom Nature's own container.\n\nNow Englishmen are born with the faculty to perform this difficult\nachievement; they inherit it. But I have known only one American who\ncould perform the feat with neatness and despatch; and, as he had\ndevoted practically all his energies to mastering this difficult alien\nart, he couldn't do much of anything else, and, except when eggs were\nbeing served in the original packages, he was practically a total loss\nin society. He was a variation of the breed who devote their lives to\nproducing a perfect salad dressing; and you must know what sad affairs\nthose persons are when not engaged in following their lone talent.\nTake them off of salad dressings and they are just naturally null and\nvoid.\n\nIn my crude and amateurish way I attacked those eggs, breaking into\nthem, not with the finesse the finished egg burglar would display, but\nmore like a yeggman attacking a safe. I spilt a good deal of the\ninsides of those eggs down over their outsides, producing a most\nuntidy effect; and when I did succeed in excavating a spoonful I\ngenerally forgot to season it, or else it was full of bits of shell.\nAltogether, the results were unsatisfactory and mussy. Rarely have I\neaten a breakfast which put so slight a subsequent strain upon my\ndigestive processes.\n\nUntil noon I hung about, preoccupied and surcharged with inner\nyearnings. There were plenty of things--important things, too, they\nwere--that I should have been doing; but I couldn't seem to fix my\nmind upon any subject except food. The stroke of midday found me\nbriskly walking into a certain restaurant on the Strand that for many\ndecades has been internationally famous for the quality and the\nunlimited quantity of its foods, and more particularly for its beef\nand its mutton. If ever you visited London in peacetime you must\nremember the place I mean.\n\nThe carvers were middle-aged full-ported men, with fine ruddy\ncomplexions, and moustaches of the Japanese weeping mulberry or\nmammoth droop variety. On signal one of them would come promptly to\nyou where you sat, he shoving ahead of him a great trencher on\nwheels, with a spirit lamp blazing beneath the platter to keep its\ndelectable burden properly hot. It might be that he brought to you a\nnoble haunch of venison or a splendid roast of pork or a vast leg of\nboiled mutton; or, more likely yet, a huge joint of beef uprearing\nlike a delectable island from a sea of bubbling gravy, with an edging\nof mashed potatoes creaming up upon its outer reefs.\n\nIf, then, you enriched this person with a shilling, or even if you\ndidn't, he would take in his brawny right hand a knife with a blade a\nfoot long, and with this knife he would cut off from the joint a slice\nabout the size and general dimensions of a horseshoer's apron. And if\nyou cared for a second slice, after finishing the first one, the\ncarver felt complimented and there was no extra charge for it. It was\nhis delight to minister to you.\n\nBut, alas, on this day when I came with my appetite whetted by my sea\nvoyage, and with an additional edge put upon it by the privations I\nhad undergone since landing, there was to be had no beef at all! Of a\nsudden this establishment, lacking its roast beef, became to me as the\ntragedy of Hamlet, the melancholy Dane, would be with Hamlet and\nOphelia and her pa and the ghost and the wicked queen, and both the\ngravediggers, all left out.\n\nWhen I had seated myself one of the carvers came to me and, with an\nabased and apologetic air, very different from his jaunty manner of\nyore, explained in a husky half whisper that I might have jugged hare\nor I might have boiled codfish, or I might have one of the awful\ndishes. Anyhow, that was what I understood him to say.\n\nThis last had an especially daunting sound, but I suppose I was in a\nmorbid state, anyhow, by now; and so I made further inquiry and\nascertained from him that the restrictions applying to the sale of\nmeat did not apply to the more intimate organs of the butchered\nanimal, such as the liver and the heart, and, in the case of a cow,\nthe tripe. But the English, with characteristic bluntness, choose to\ncall one of these in its cooked state an offal dish--pronounced as\nspelled and frequently tasting as pronounced.\n\nAs one who had primed himself for a pound or so of the rib-roast\nsection of a grass-fed steer, I was not to be put off with one of the\ncritter's spare parts, as it were. Nor did the thought of codfish, and\nespecially boiled codfish, appeal to me greatly. I have no settled\nantipathy to the desiccated tissues of this worthy deep-sea voyager\nwhen made up into fish cakes. Moreover that young and adolescent\ncreature, commonly called a Boston scrod, which is a codfish whose\nvoice is just changing, is not without its attractions; but the\nfull-grown species is not a favourite of mine.\n\nTo me there has ever been something depressing about an adult codfish.\nAny one who has ever had occasion to take cod-liver oil--as who,\nunhappily, has not?--is bound to appreciate the true feelings that\nmust inevitably come to a codfish as he goes to and fro in the deep\nfor years on a stretch, carrying that kind of a liver about with him\nall the while.\n\nAs a last resort I took the jugged hare; but jugged hare was not what\nI craved. At eventide, returning to the same restaurant, I was\nluckier. I found mutton on the menu; but, even so, yet another hard\nblow awaited me. By reason of the meat-rationing arrangements a single\npurchaser was restricted to so many ounces a week, and no more. The\nportion I received in exchange for a corner clipped off my meat card\nwas but a mere reminder of what a portion in that house would have\nbeen in the old days.\n\nThere had been a time when a sincere but careless diner from up\nScotland way, down in London on a visit, would have carried away more\nthan that much on his necktie; which did not matter particularly then,\nwhen food was plentiful; and, besides, usually he wore a pattern of\nnecktie which was improved by almost anything that was spilled upon\nit. But it did matter to me that I had to dine on this hangnail pared\nfrom a sheep.\n\nA few days later I partook of a fast at what was supposed to be a\nluncheon, which the Lord Mayor of London attended, in company with\nsundry other notables. Earlier readings had led me to expect an\nendless array of spicy and succulent viands at any table a Lord Mayor\nmight grace with his presence. Such, though, was not the case here. We\nhad eggs for an _entr\u00e9e_; and after that we had plain boiled turbot,\nwhich to my mind is no great shakes of a fish, even when tuckered up\nwith sauces; and after that we had coffee and cigars; and finally we\nhad several cracking good speeches by members of a race whose men are\nerroneously believed by some Americans to be practically inarticulate\nwhen they get up on their feet and try to talk.\n\nThere was a touch of tragedy mingled in with the comedy of the\nsituation in the spectacle of these Englishmen, belonging to a nation\nof proverbially generous feeders, stinting themselves and cutting the\nlardings and the sweetenings and the garnishments down to the limit\nthat there might be a greater abundance of solid sustenance\nforthcoming for their fighting forces.\n\nI do not mean by this that there was any real lack of nourishing\nprovender in London or anywhere else in England that I went. The long\nqueues of waiting patrons in front of the butcher shops during the\nfirst few days of my sojourn very soon disappeared when people learned\nthat they could be sure of getting meat of one sort or another, and at\na price fixed by law; which was a good thing too, seeing that thereby\nthe extortioner and the profiteer lost their chances to gain unduly\nthrough the necessities of the populace. So far as I was able to\nascertain, nobody on the island actually suffered--except the present\nwriter of these lines; and he suffered chiefly because he could not\nrestrain himself from comparing the English foods of pre-war periods\nwith the English foods of the hour.\n\nIf things were thus in England, what would they be in France? This was\nthe question I repeatedly put to myself. But when I got to France a\nsurprise awaited me. It was a surprise deferred, because for the\nfirst week of my sojourn upon French soil I was the guest of the\nBritish military authorities at a ch\u00e2teau maintained for the\nentertainment of visiting Americans who bore special credentials from\nthe British Foreign Office.\n\nHere, because Britain took such good and splendid care to provide\namply for her men in uniform, there was a wide variety of good food\nand an abundance of it for the guests and hosts alike. I figured,\nthough, that when I had passed beyond the zone of this gracious\nhospitality there would be slim pickings. Not at all!\n\nIn Paris there was to be had all the food and nearly all the sorts of\nfood any appetite, however fastidious, might crave. This was before\nthe French borrowed the card system of ration control in order to\ngovern the consumption of certain of the necessities. Of poultry and\nof sea foods the only limits to what one might order were his interior\ncapacity and his purse. Of red meats there was seemingly a boundless\nsupply.\n\nOne reason for this plenitude lay in the fact that France, to a very\ngreat extent, is a self-contained, self-supporting land, which England\ndistinctly is not; and another reason undoubtedly was that the French,\nbeing more frugal and careful than their British or their American\nbrethren ever have been, make culinary use of a great deal of\nhealthful provender which the English-speaking races throw away.\nMerely by glancing at the hors d'oeuvres served at luncheon in a\nmedium-priced caf\u00e9 in Paris one can get a good general idea of what\ndiscriminating persons declined to eat at dinner the night before.\n\nThe Parisian garbage collector must work by the day and not by the\njob. On a piecework contract he would starve to death. And a third\nreason was that all through the country the peasants, by request of\nthe Government, were slaughtering their surplus beeves and sheep and\nswine, so there might be more forage for the army horses and more\ngrain available for the flour rations of the soldiers.\n\nIn Paris the bread was indifferently poor. An individual was\nrestricted to one medium-sized roll of bread at a meal. Butter was not\nby any means abundant, and of sugar there was none to be had at all\nunless the traveller had bethought him to slip a supply into the\ncountry with him. The bulk of the milk supply was requisitioned for\nbabies and invalids and disabled soldiers. Cakes or pastries in any\nform were absolutely prohibited in the public eating places, and, I\nthink, in private homes as well. But of beef and mutton and veal and\nfowls, and the various products of the humble but widely versatile\npig, there was no end, provided you had the inclination plus the\nprice.\n\nAnd so, though the lack of sugar in one's food gave one an almost\nconstant craving for something sweet--and incidentally insured a host\nof friends for anybody who came along with a box of American candy\nunder his arm or a few cakes of sweet chocolate in his pocket--one\nmight take his choice of a wide diversity of fare at any restaurant\nof the first or second class, and keep well stayed.\n\nIn connection with the Paris restaurants I made a most interesting\ndiscovery, which was that when France called up her available man\npower at the time of the great mobilisation, the military heads\nsomehow overlooked one group who, for their sins, should have been\nsent up where bullets and Huns were thickest. The slum gave up its\nApache--and a magnificent fighter he is said to have made too! And the\npiratical cab drivers who formerly infested the boulevards must have\nanswered the summons almost to a man, because only a few of them are\nleft nowadays, and they mainly wear markings to prove they have served\nin the ranks; but by a most reprehensible error of somebody in\nauthority the typical head waiters of the caf\u00e9s were spared. I base\nthis assertion upon the fact that all of them appeared to be on duty\nat the time of my latest visit. If there was a single absentee from\nthe ranks I failed to miss him.\n\nThere they were, the same hawk-eyed banditti crew that one was\nconstantly encountering in the old days; and up to all the same old\ntricks too--such as adding the date of the month and all the figures\nof the year into the bill; and such as invariably recommending the\nmost expensive dishes to foreigners; and such as coming to one and\nbending over one and smiling upon one and murmuring to one: \"An' wot\nwill ze gentailman 'ave to-day?\"--and then, before the gentailman can\nanswer, jumping right in and telling him what he is going to have,\nalways favouring at least three different kinds of meats for even the\nlightest meal, and never less than two vegetables, and never once\nfailing to recommend a full bottle of the costliest wine on the\npremises.\n\nStress of war had not caused these gentry to forget or forgo a single\none of the ancient wiles that for half a century their kind has\npractised upon American tourists and others who didn't care what else\nthey did with their money so long as they were given a chance to spend\nit for something they didn't particularly want. Yep; those charged\nwith the responsibility of calling up the reserves certainly made a\nbig mistake back yonder in August of 1914. They practised\ndiscrimination in the wrong quarter altogether. If any favouritism was\nto be shown they should have taken the head waiters and left the\nApaches at home.\n\nMany's the hard battle that I had with these chaps in 1918. It never\nfailed--not one single, solitary time did it fail--that the\nfunctionary who took my order first tried to tell me what my order was\ngoing to be, and then, after a struggle, reluctantly consented to\nbring me the things I wanted and insisted on having. Never once did he\nomit the ceremony of impressing it upon me that he would regard it as\na deep favour if only I would be so good as to order a whole lobster.\nI do not think there was anything personal in this; he recommended the\nlobster because lobster was the most expensive thing he had in stock.\nIf he could have thought of anything more expensive than lobster he\nwould have recommended that.\n\nI always refused--not that I harbour any grudge against lobsters as a\nclass, but because I object to being dictated to by a buccaneer with\nflat feet, who wears a soiled dickey instead of a shirt, and who is\nonly waiting for a chance to overcharge me or short-change me, or give\nme bad money, or something. If every other form of provender had\nfailed them the populace of Paris could have subsisted very\ncomfortably for several days on the lobsters I refused to buy in the\ncourse of the spring and summer of last year. I'm sure of it.\n\nAnd when I had firmly, emphatically, yea, ofttimes passionately\ndeclined the proffered lobster, he, having with difficulty mastered\nhis chagrin, would seek to direct my attention to the salmon, his\nmotive for this change in tactics being that salmon, though apparently\nplentiful, was generally the second most expensive item upon the\nregular menu. Salmon as served in Paris wears a different aspect from\nthe one commonly worn by it when it appears upon the table here.\n\nOver there they cut the fish through amidships, in cross-sections,\nand, removing the segment of spinal column, spread the portion flat\nupon a plate and serve it thus; the result greatly resembling a pair\nof miniature pink horse collars. A man who knew not the salmon in his\nnative state, or ordering salmon in France, would get the idea that\nthe salmon was bowlegged and that the breast had been sold to some one\nelse, leaving only the hind quarters for him.\n\nHarking back to lobsters, I am reminded of a tragedy to which I was an\neyewitness. Nearly every night for a week or more two of us dined at\nthe same restaurant on the Rue de Rivoli. On the occasion of our first\nappearance here we were confronted as we entered by a large table\nbearing all manner of special delicacies and cold dishes. Right in the\nmiddle of the array was one of the largest lobsters I ever saw,\nreposing on a couch of water cress and seaweed, arranged upon a\nserviette. He made an impressive sight as he lay there prone upon his\nstomach, fidgeting his feelers in a petulant way.\n\nWe two took seats near by. At once the silent signal was given\nsignifying, in the cipher code, \"Americans in the house!\" And the\n_ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel_ came to where he rested and, grasping him firmly just\nback of the armpits, picked him up and brought him over to us and\ninvited us to consider his merits. When we had singly and together\ndeclined to consider the proposition of eating him in each of the\nthree languages we knew--namely, English, bad French, and profane--the\nmaster sorrowfully returned him to his bed.\n\nPresently two other Americans entered and immediately after them a\nparty of English officers, and then some more Americans. Each time the\nboss would gather up the lobster and personally introduce him to the\nnewcomers, just as he had done in our case, by poking the monster\nunder their noses and making him wriggle to show that he was really\nalive and not operated by clockwork, and enthusiastically dilating\nupon his superior attractions, which, he assured them, would be\nenormously enhanced if only _messieurs_ would agree forthwith to\npartake of him in a broiled state. But there were no takers; and so\nback again he would go to his place by the door, there to remain till\nthe next prospective victim arrived.\n\nWe fell into the habit of going to this place in the evenings in order\nto enjoy repetitions of this performance while dining. The lobster\nbecame to us as an old friend, a familiar acquaintance. We took to\ncalling him Jess Willard, partly on account of his reach and partly on\naccount of his rugged appearance, but most of all because his manager\nappeared to have so much trouble in getting him matched with anybody.\n\nHalf a dozen times a night, or oftener, he travelled under escort\nthrough the dining room, always returning again to his regular\nstation. Along about the middle of the week he began to fail visibly.\nBefore our eyes we saw him fading. Either the artificial life he was\nleading or the strain of being turned down so often was telling upon\nhim. It preyed upon his mind, as we could discern by his morose\nexpression. It sapped his splendid vitality as well. No longer did he\nexpand his chest and wave his numerous extremities about when being\nexhibited before the indifferent eyes of possible investors, but\nremained inert, logy, gloomy, spiritless--a melancholy spectacle\nindeed.\n\nIt now required artificial stimulation to induce him to display even a\ntemporary interest in his surroundings. With a practised finger, his\nkeeper would thump him on the tenderer portions of his stomach, and\nthen he would wake up; but it was only for a moment. He relapsed again\ninto his lamentable state of depression and languor. By every outward\nsign here was a lobster that fain would withdraw from the world. But\nwe knew that for him there was no opportunity to do so; on the hoof he\nrepresented too many precious francs to be allowed to go into\nretirement.\n\nComing on Saturday night we realised that for our old friend the end\nwas nigh. His eyes were deeply set about two-thirds of the way back\ntoward his head and with one listless claw he picked at the serviette.\nThe summons was very near; the dread inevitable impended.\n\nSunday night he was still present, but in a greatly altered state.\nDuring the preceding twenty-four hours his brave spirit had fled. They\nhad boiled him then; so now, instead of being green, he was a bright\nand varnished red all over, the exact colour of Truck Six in the\nPaducah Fire Department.\n\nWe felt that we who had been sympathisers at the bedside during some\nof his farewell moments owed it to his memory to assist in the last\nsad rites. At a perfectly fabulous price we bought the departed and\nundertook to give him what might be called a personal interment; but\nhe was a disappointment. He should have been allowed to take the veil\nbefore misanthropy had entirely undermined his health and destroyed\nhis better nature, and made him, as it were, morbid. Like Harry Leon\nWilson's immortal Cousin Egbert, he could be pushed just so far, and\nno farther.\n\nBefore I left Paris the city was put upon bread cards. The country at\nlarge was supposed to be on bread rations too; but in most of the\nsmaller towns I visited the hotel keepers either did not know about\nthe new regulation or chose to disregard it. Certainly they generally\ndisregarded it so far as we were concerned. For all I know to the\ncontrary, though, they were restricting their ordinary patrons to the\nordained quantities and making an exception in the case of our people.\nIt may have been one of their ways of showing a special courtesy to\nrepresentatives of an allied race. It would have been characteristic\nof these kindly provincial innkeepers to have done just that thing.\n\nLikewise, one could no longer obtain cheese in a first-grade Paris\nrestaurant or aboard a French dining car, though cheese was to be had\nin unstinted quantity in the rural districts and in the Paris shops;\nand, I believe, it was also procurable in the caf\u00e9s of the Parisian\nworking classes, provided it formed a part of a meal costing not more\nthan five francs, or some such sum. In a first-rate place it was, of\ncourse, impossible to get any sort of meal for five francs, or ten\nfrancs either; especially after the ten per cent luxury tax had been\ntacked on.\n\nIn March prices at the smarter caf\u00e9 eating places had already\nadvanced, I should say, at least one hundred per cent above the\ncustomary pre-war rates; and by midsummer the tariffs showed a second\nhundred per cent increase in delicacies, and one of at least fifty per\ncent in staples, which brought them almost up to the New York\nstandards. Outside of Paris prices continued to be moderate and fair.\n\nJust as I was about starting on my last trip to the Front before\nsailing for home, official announcement was made that dog biscuits\nwould shortly be advanced in price to a well-nigh prohibitive figure.\nSo I presume that very shortly thereafter the head waiters began\noffering dog biscuits to American guests. I knew they would do so,\njust as soon as a dog biscuit cost more than a lobster did.\n\nUntil this trip I never appreciated what a race of perfect cooks the\nFrench are. I thought I did, but I didn't. One visiting the big cities\nor stopping at show places and resorts along the main lines of motor\nand rail travel in peacetime could never come to a real and due\nappreciation of the uniformly high culinary expertness of the populace\nin general. I had to take campaigning trips across country into\nisolated districts lying well off the old tourist lanes to learn the\nlesson. Having learned it, I profited by it.\n\nNo matter how small the hamlet or how dingy appearing the so-called\nhotel in it might be, we were sure of getting satisfying food, cooked\nagreeably and served to us by a friendly, smiling little French\nmaiden, and charged for at a most reasonable figure, considering that\ngenerally the town was fairly close up to the fighting lines and the\nbringing in of supplies for civilians' needs was frequently\nsubordinated to the handling of military necessities.\n\nIndeed, the place might be almost within range of the big guns and\nsubjected to bombing outrages by enemy airmen, but somehow the local\nBoniface managed to produce food ample for our desires, and most\nappetising besides. His larder might be limited, but his good nature,\nlike his willingness and his hospitality, was boundless.\n\nI predict that there is going to be an era of better cooking in\nAmerica before very long. Our soldiers, returning home, are going to\ndemand a tastier and more diversified fare than many of them enjoyed\nbefore they put on khaki and went overseas; and they are going to get\nit, too. Remembering what they had to eat under French roofs, they\nwill never again be satisfied with meats fried to death, with soggy\nvegetables, with underdone breads.\n\nSometimes as we went scouting about on our roving commission to see\nwhat we might see, at mealtime we would enter a community too small\nto harbour within it any establishment calling itself a hotel. In such\na case this, then, would be our procedure: We would run down to the\nrailroad crossing and halt at the door of the inevitable _Caf\u00e9 de la\nStation_, or, as we should say in our language, the Last Chance\nSaloon; and of the proprietor we would inquire the name and\nwhereabouts of some person in the community who might be induced, for\na price, to feed a duet or a trio of hungry correspondents.\n\nAt first, when we were green at the thing, we sometimes tried to\ninterrogate the local gendarme; but complications, misunderstandings,\nand that same confusion of tongues which spoiled so promising a\nbuilding project one time at the Tower of Babel always ensued. Central\nEurope has a very dense population, as the geographies used to tell\nus; but the densest ones get on the police force.\n\nSo when by bitter experience we had learned that the gendarme never by\nany chance could get our meaning and that we never could understand\nhis gestures, we hit upon the wise expedient of going right away to\nthe Last Chance for information.\n\nAt the outset I preferred to let one of my companions conduct the\ninquiry; but presently it dawned upon me that my mode of speech gave\nunbounded joy to my provincial audiences, and I decided that if a\nlittle exertion on my part brought a measure of innocent pleasure into\nthe lives of these good folks it was my duty, as an Ally, to oblige\nwhenever possible.\n\nI came to realise that all these years I have been employing the wrong\nvehicle when I strive to dash off whimsicalities, because frequently\nmy very best efforts, as done in English, have fallen flat. But when\nin some remote village I, using French, uttered the simplest and most\ncommonplace remark to a French tavern keeper, with absolutely no\nintent or desire whatsoever, mind you, to be humorous or facetious,\ninvariably he would burst instantly into peals of unbridled merriment.\n\nFrequently he would call in his wife or some of his friends to help\nhim laugh. And then, when his guffaws had died away into gentle\nchuckles, he would make answer; and if he spoke rapidly, as he always\ndid, I would be swept away by the freshets of his eloquence and left\ngasping far beyond my depth.\n\nThat was why, when I went to a revue in Paris, I hoped they'd have\nsome good tumbling on the bill.\n\nI understand French, of course, curiously enough, but not as spoken. I\nlikewise have difficulty in making out its meaning when I read it; but\nin other regards I flatter myself that my knowledge of the language is\nquite adequate. Certainly, as I have just stated, I managed to create\na pleasant sensation among my French hearers when I employed it in\nconversation.\n\nAs I was saying, the general rule was that I should ask the name and\nwhereabouts of a house in the town where we might procure victuals;\nand then, after a bit, when the laughing had died down, one of my\ncompanions would break in and find out what we wanted to know.\n\nThe information thus secured probably led us to a tiny cottage of\nmud-daubed wattles. Our hostess there might be a shapeless, wrinkled,\nclumsy old woman. Her kitchen equipment might be confined to an open\nfire and a spit, and a few battered pots.\n\nHer larder might be most meagrely circumscribed as to variety, and\ngenerally was. But she could concoct such savoury dishes for us--such\nmarvellous, golden-brown fried potatoes; such good soups; such savoury\nomelets; such toothsome fragrant stews! Especially such stews!\n\nFor all we knew--or cared--the meat she put into her pot might have\nbeen horse meat and the garnishments such green things as she had\nplucked at the roadside; but the flavour of the delectable broth cured\nus of any inclinations to make investigation as to the former stations\nin life of its basic constituents. I am satisfied that, chosen at\nrandom, almost any peasant housewife of France can take an old Palm\nBeach suit and a handful of potherbs and, mingling these together\naccording to her own peculiar system, turn out a ragout fit for a\nking. Indeed, it would be far too good for some kings I know of.\n\nAnd if she had a worn-out bath sponge and the cork of a discarded\nvanilla-extract bottle she, calling upon her hens for a little help in\nthe matter of eggs, could produce for dessert a delicious meringue,\nwith floating-island effects in it. I'd stake my life on her ability\nto deliver.\n\nIf, on such an occasion as the one I have sought to describe, we were\nperchance in the south of France or in the C\u00f4te-d'Or country, lying\nover toward the Swiss border, we could count upon having a bait of\ndelicious strawberries to wind up with. But if perchance we had fared\ninto one of the northeastern provinces we were reasonably certain the\nmeal would be rounded out with helpings of a certain kind of cheese\nthat is indigenous to those parts. It comes in a flat cake, which\ninvariably is all caved in and squashed out, as though the\ncheese-maker had sat upon it while bringing it into the market in his\ntwo-wheeled cart.\n\nLikewise, when its temperature goes up, it becomes more of a liquid\nthan a solid; and it has an aroma by virtue of which it secures the\nattention and commands the respect of the most casual passer-by. It is\nmore than just cheese. I should call it mother-of-cheese. It is to\nother and lesser cheeses as civet cats are to canary birds--if you get\nwhat I mean; and in its company the most boisterous Brie or the most\nvociferous Camembert you ever saw becomes at once deaf and dumb.\n\nIts flavour is wonderful. Mainly it is found in ancient Normandy; and,\namong strangers, eating it--or, when it is in an especially fluid\nstate, drinking it--comes under the head of outdoor sports. But the\nnatives take it right into the same house with themselves.\n\nAnd, no matter where we were--in Picardy, in Brittany, in the Vosges\nor the Champagne, as the case might be--we had wonderful crusty bread\nand delicious butter and a good light wine to go along with our meal.\nWe would sit at a bare table in the smoky cluttered interior of the\nold kitchen, with the rafters just over our heads, and with the broken\ntiles--or sometimes the bare earthen floor--beneath our feet, and\nwould eat our fill.\n\nMore times than once or twice or thrice I have known the mistress of\nthe house at settlement time to insist that we were overpaying her.\nFrom a civilian compatriot she would have exacted the last sou of her\njust due; but, because we were Americans and because our country had\nsent its sons overseas to help her people save France, she, a\nrepresentative of the most canny and thrifty class in a country known\nfor the thriftiness of all its classes, hesitated to accept the full\namount of the sum we offered her in payment.\n\nShe believed us, of course, to be rich--in the eyes of the European\npeasant all Americans are rich--and she was poor and hard put to it to\nearn her living; but here was a chance for her to show in her own way\na sense of what she, as a Frenchwoman, felt for America. Somehow, the\nmore you see of the French, the less you care for the Germans.\n\nMoving on up a few miles nearer the trenches, we would run into our\nown people; and then we were sure of a greeting, and a chair apiece\nand a tin plate and a tin cup apiece at an American mess. I have had\nchuck with privates and I have had chow with noncoms; I have had grub\nwith company commanders and I have dined with generals--and always the\nmeal was flavoured with the good, strong man-talk of the real\nhe-American.\n\nThe food was of the best quality and there was plenty of it for all,\nand some to spare. One reason--among others--why the Yank fought so\nwell was because he was so well fed between fights.\n\nThe very best meals I had while abroad were vouchsafed me during the\nthree days I spent with a front-line regiment as a guest of the\ncolonel of one of our negro outfits. To this colonel a French\ngeneral, out of the goodness of his heart, had loaned his cook, a\nwhiskered poilu, who, before he became a whiskered poilu, had been the\nchef in the castle of one of the richest men in Europe.\n\nThis genius cooked the midday meals and the dinners; but, because no\nFrenchman can understand why any one should require for breakfast\nanything more solid than a dry roll and a dab of honey, the\npreparation of the morning meal was intrusted to a Southern black boy,\nwho, I may say, was a regular skillet hound. And this gifted youth\nwrestled with the matutinal ham and eggs and flipped the flapjacks for\nthe headquarters mess.\n\nOn a full Southern breakfast and a wonderful French luncheon and\ndinner a grown man can get through the day very, very well indeed, as\nI bear witness.\n\nHowsomever, as spring wore into summer and summer ran its course, I\nbegan to long with a constantly increasing longing for certain\ndistinctive dishes to be found nowhere except in my native clime;\nbrook trout, for example, and roasting ears, and--Oh, lots of things!\nSo I came home to get them.\n\nAnd, now that I've had them, I often catch myself in the act of\nthoughtfully dwelling upon the fond remembrances of those spicy\nfragrant stews eaten in peasant kitchens, and those army doughnuts,\nand those slices of bacon toasted at daybreak on the lids of mess kits\nin British dugouts.\n\nI suppose they call contentment a jewel because it is so rare.\n\n\n\nFICTION\n\nTHOSE TIMES AND THESE\nLOCAL COLOR\nOLD JUDGE PRIEST\nFIBBLE, D.D.\nBACK HOME\nTHE ESCAPE OF MR.
