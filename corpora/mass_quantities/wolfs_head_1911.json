    "body": "1911\n\n\nIt might well be called the country of the outlaw, this vast tract of\ndense mountain forests and craggy ravines, this congeries of swirling\ntorrents and cataracts and rapids. Here wild beasts lurked out their\nsavage lives, subsisting by fang and prey,--the panther, the bear, the\ncatamount, the wolf,--and like unto them, ferocious and fugitive, both\nfearsome and afraid, the man with a \u201cwolf\u2019s head,\u201d on which was set a\nprice, even as the State\u2019s bounty for the scalps of the ravening brutes.\n\nOne gloomy October afternoon, the zest of a group of sportsmen, who had\npitched their camp in this sequestered wilderness, suffered an abatement\non the discovery of the repute of the region and the possibility of\nbeing summoned to serve on a sheriff\u2019s posse in the discharge of the\ngrimmest of duties.\n\n\u201cBut he is no outlaw in the proper sense of the term. The phrase has\nsurvived, but the fact is obsolete,\u201d said Seymour, who was both a prig\nand a purist, a man of leisure, and bookish, but a good shot, and vain\nof his sylvan accomplishments. \u201cOur law places no man beyond the pale\nof its protection. He has a constitutional right to plead his case in\ncourt.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the reward offered to hale him forth and force him to enjoy\nthat privilege--five hundred dollars?\u201d asked Bygrave, who was a\nnewspaper man and had a habit of easy satire.\n\n\u201cOf course he would never suffer himself to be taken alive.\u201d Purcell\u2019s\nvocation was that of a broker, and he was given to the discrimination\nof chances and relative values. \u201cTherefore he is as definitely _caput\nlupinum_ as any outlaw of old. Nobody would be held accountable for\ncracking his \u2018wolf\u2019s head\u2019 off, in the effort to arrest him for the sake\nof the five hundred dollars. But, meantime, how does the fellow contrive\nto live!\u201d\n\n\u201cJes by his rifle, I reckon,\u201d replied the rural gossip whom intrusive\ncuriosity occasionally lured to their camp-fire. \u201cThough sence that thar\nbig reward hev been n\u2019ised abroad, I\u2019d think he\u2019d be plumb afraid ter\nfire a shot. The echoes be mighty peart these dumb, damp fall days.\u201d\n\nThe old jeans-clad mountaineer had a certain keen spryness of aspect,\ndespite his bent knees and stooped shoulders. His deeply grooved,\nnarrow, thin face was yet more elongated by the extension of a high\nforehead into a bald crown, for he wore his broad wool hat on the back\nof his head. There was something in his countenance not dissimilar to\nthe facial contour of a grasshopper, and the suggestion was heightened\nby his persistent, rasping chirp.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what frets Meddy; she can\u2019t abide the idee of huntin\u2019 a human\nwith sech special coursers ez money reward. She \u2018lows it mought tempt\na\u2019 evil man or a\u2019 ignorant one ter swear a miser\u2019ble wretch\u2019s life\naway. Let the law strengthen its own hands--that\u2019s what Meddy say. Don\u2019t\nkindle the sperit of Cain in every brother\u2019s breast. Oh, Meddy is plumb\ncomical whenst she fairly gits ter goin\u2019, though it\u2019s all on account of\nthat thar man what war growed up in a tree.\u201d\n\nThe dryadic suggestions of a dendroidal captivity flashed into Seymour\u2019s\nmind with the phrase, and stimulated his curiosity as to some quaint\nrural perversion of the legend.\n\nBut it was grim fact that the old mountaineer detailed in answer to the\nquestion, as he sat on a log by the fire, while the sportsmen lay on the\nground about it and idly listened.\n\n\u201cOne day--\u2018t war \u2018bout two year\u2019 ago--thar war a valley-man up hyar\na-huntin\u2019 in the mountings with some other fellers, an\u2019 toward sunset\nhe war a-waitin\u2019 at a stand on a deer-path up thar nigh Headlong Creek,\nhopin\u2019 ter git a shot whenst the deer went down to drink. Waal, I reckon\nluck war ag\u2019in\u2019 him, fer he got nuthin\u2019 but durned tired. So, ez he\nwaited, he grounded his rifle, an\u2019 leaned himself ag\u2019in\u2019 a great big\ntree ter rest his bones. And presently he jes happened ter turn his\nhead, an\u2019, folks! he seen a sight! Fer thar, right close ter his cheek,\nhe looked into a skellington\u2019s eye-sockets. Thar war a skellington\u2019s\ngrisly face peerin\u2019 at him through a crack in the bark.\u201d\n\nThe raconteur suddenly stopped short, while the group remained silent\nin expectancy. The camp-fire, with its elastic, leaping flames, had\nbepainted the darkening avenues of the russet woods with long, fibrous\nstrokes of red and yellow, as with a brush scant of color. The autumnal\nair was dank, with subtle shivers. A precipice was not far distant on\nthe western side, and there the darksome forest fell away, showing above\nthe massive, purple mountains a section of sky in a heightened clarity\nof tint, a suave, saffron hue, with one horizontal bar of vivid\nvermilion that lured the eye. The old mountaineer gazed retrospectively\nat it as he resumed:\n\n\u201cWaal, sirs, that town-man had never consorted with sech ez\nskellingtons. He lit out straight! He made tracks! He never stopped till\nhe reached Colbury, an\u2019 thar he told his tale. Then the sheriff he tuk\na hand in the game. Skellingtons, he said, didn\u2019t grow on trees\nspontaneous, an\u2019 he hed an official interes\u2019 in human relics out o\u2019\nplace. So he kem,--the tree is \u2018twixt hyar an\u2019 my house thar on the\nrise,--an\u2019, folks! the tale war plain. Some man chased off \u2018n the face\nof the yearth, hid out from the law,--that\u2019s the way Meddy takes it,--he\nhed clomb the tree, an\u2019 it bein\u2019 holler, he drapped down inside it,\nthinkin\u2019 o\u2019 course he could git out the way he went in. But, no! It\nmonght hev been deeper \u2018n he calculated, or mo\u2019 narrow, but he couldn\u2019t\nmake the rise. He died still strugglin\u2019, fer his long, bony fingers war\ngripped in the wood--it\u2019s rotted a deal sence then.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho was the man?\u201d asked Seymour.\n\n\u201cNobody knows,--nobody keers \u2018cept\u2019 Meddy. She hev wep\u2019 a bushel o\u2019\ntears about him. The cor\u2019ner \u2018lowed from the old-fashioned flint-lock\nrifle he hed with him that it mus\u2019 hev happened nigh a hunderd years\nago. Meddy she will git ter studyin\u2019 on that of a winter night, an\u2019 how\nthe woman that keered fer him mus\u2019 hev watched an\u2019 waited fer him, an\u2019\n\u2018lowed he war deceitful an\u2019 de-sertin\u2019, an\u2019 mebbe held a gredge agin\nhim, whilst he war dyin\u2019 so pitiful an\u2019 helpless, walled up in that\ntree. Then Meddy will tune up agin, an\u2019 mighty nigh cry her eyes out.\nHe warn\u2019t even graced with a death-bed ter breathe his last; Meddy air\npartic\u2019lar afflicted that he hed ter die afoot.\u201d Old Kettison glanced\nabout the circle, consciously facetious, his heavily grooved face\ndistended in a mocking grin.\n\n\u201cA horrible fate!\u201d exclaimed Seymour, with a half-shudder.\n\n\u201cEdzac\u2019ly,\u201d the old mountaineer assented easily.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s her name--Meggy?\u201d asked the journalist, with a mechanical\naptitude for detail, no definite curiosity.\n\n\u201cNaw; Meddy--short fer Meddlesome. Her right name is Clementina Haddox;\nbut I reckon every livin\u2019 soul hev forgot\u2019 it but me. She is jes\nMeddlesome by name, an\u2019 meddlesome by natur\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe suddenly turned, gazing up the steep, wooded slope with an expectant\nmien, for the gentle rustling amidst the dense, red leaves of the\nsumac-bushes heralded an approach.\n\n\u201cThat mus\u2019 be Meddy now,\u201d he commented, \u201cwith her salt-risin\u2019 bread. She\nlowed she war goin\u2019 ter fetch you-uns some whenst I tol\u2019 her you-uns war\nlackin\u2019.\u201d\n\nFor the camp-hunt had already been signalized by divers disasters: the\nstore of loaves in the wagon had been soaked by an inopportune shower;\nthe young mountaineer who had combined the offices of guide and cook was\nthe victim of an accidental discharge of a fowling-piece, receiving a\nload of bird-shot full in his face. Though his injury was slight, he had\nreturned home, promising to supply his place by sending his brother, who\nhad not yet arrived. Purcell\u2019s boast that he could bake ash-cake proved\na bluff, and although the party could and did broil bacon and even birds\non the coals, they were reduced to the extremity of need for the staff\nof life.\n\nHence they were predisposed in the ministrant\u2019s favor as she appeared,\nand were surprised to find that Meddlesome, instead of masterful and\nmiddle-aged, was a girl of eighteen, looking very shy and appealing as\nshe paused on the verge of the flaring sumac copse, one hand lifted to\na swaying bough, the other arm sustaining a basket. Even her coarse gown\nlent itself to pleasing effect, since its dull-brown hue composed well\nwith the red and russet glow of the leaves about her, and its short\nwaist, close sleeves, and scant skirt, reaching to the instep, the\nimmemorial fashion of the hills, were less of a grotesque rusticity\nsince there was prevalent elsewhere a vogue of quasi-Empire modes, of\nwhich the cut of her garb was reminiscent. A saffron kerchief about her\nthroat had in its folds a necklace of over-cup acorns in three strands,\nand her hair, meekly parted on her forehead, was of a lustrous brown,\nand fell in heavy undulations on her shoulders. There was a delicate but\ndistinct tracery of bine veins in her milky-white complexion, and she\nmight have seemed eminently calculated for meddling disastrously with\nthe peace of mind of the mountain youth were it not for the preoccupied\nexpression of her eyes. Though large, brown and long-lashed, they were\nfull of care and perplexity, and a frowning, disconcerted line between\nher eye-brows was so marked as almost to throw her face out of drawing.\nTroubled about many things, evidently, was Meddlesome. She could not\neven delegate the opening of a basket that her little brother had\nbrought and placed beside the camp-fire.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t, Gran\u2019dad,\u201d she exclaimed suddenly, stepping alertly\nforward--\u201c_don\u2019t_ put that loaf in that thar bread-box; the box \u2018pears\nter be damp. Leave the loaf in the big basket till ter-morrer. It\u2019ll\neat shorter then, bein\u2019 fraish-baked. They kin hev these biscuits fer\nsupper,\u201d--dropping on one knee and setting forth on the cloth, from the\nbasket on her arm, some thick soggy-looking lumps of dough,--\u201cI baked\nsome dodgers, too--four, six, eight, ten,\u201d--she was counting a dozen\ngolden-brown cates of delectable aspect--\u201cknowin\u2019 they would hone fer\ncornmeal arter huntin\u2019, an\u2019 nuthin\u2019 else nohow air fitten ter eat with\nfeesh or aigs. Hev you-uns got any aigs!\u201d She sprang up, and, standing\non agile tiptoe, peered without ceremony into their wagon. Instantly\nshe recoiled with a cry of horrified reproach. \u201cThar \u2018s ants in yer\nshort-sweetenin\u2019! How _could_ you-uns let sechez that happen!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, surely not,\u201d exclaimed Purcell, hastening to her side. But the fact\ncould not be gainsaid; the neglected sugar was spoiled.\n\nMeddlesome\u2019s unwarranted intrusion into the arcana of their domestic\nconcerns disclosed other shortcomings. \u201cWhy n\u2019t ye keep the top on yer\ncoffee-can? Don\u2019t ye know the coffee will lose heart, settin\u2019 open?\u201d She\nrepaired this oversight with a deft touch, and then proceeded: \u201cWe-uns\nain\u2019t got no short-sweetenin\u2019 at our house, but I\u2019ll send my leetle\nbrother ter fetch some long-sweetenin\u2019 fer yer coffee ter night. Hyar,\nSol,\u201d--addressing the small, limber, tow-headed, barefooted boy, a\nludicrous miniature of a man in long, loose, brown-jeans trousers\nsupported by a single suspender over an unbleached cotton shirt,--\u201crun\nter the house an\u2019 fetch the sorghum-jug.\u201d\n\nAs Sol started off with the alertness of a scurrying rabbit, she shrilly\ncalled out in a frenzy of warning: \u201cGo the other way, Sol--up through\nthe pawpaws! Them cherty rocks will cut yer feet like a knife.\u201d\n\nSol had nerves of his own. Her sharp cry had caused him to spring\nprecipitately backward, frightened, but uncomprehending his danger.\nBeing unhurt, he was resentful\u2019 \u201cThey ain\u2019t none o\u2019 _yer_ feet, nohow,\u201d\n he grumbled, making a fresh start at less speed.\n\n\u201cOh, yes, Sol,\u201d said the old grandfather, enjoying the contretemps and\nthe sentiment of revolt against Meddlesome\u2019s iron rule. \u201cEverything\nbelongs ter Meddlesome one way or another, \u2018ca\u2019se she jes makes it\nhern. So take keer of _yer_ feet for _her_ sake.\u201d He turned toward her\njocosely as the small emissary disappeared among the undergrowth. \u201cI jes\nbeen tellin\u2019 these hunter-men, Meddy, \u2018bout how ye sets yerself even\nter meddle with other folkses\u2019 mourning--what they got through with a\nhunderd year\u2019 ago--tormentatin\u2019 \u2018bout that thar man what war starved in\nthe tree.\u201d\n\nShe heard him, doubtless, for a rising flush betokened her deprecation\nof this ridicule in the presence of these strangers. But it was rather\nthat she remembered his words afterward than heeded them now. It would\nseem that certain incidents, insignificant in themselves, are the pivots\non which turns the scheme of fate. She could not imagine that upon her\naction in the next few seconds depended grave potentialities in more\nlives than one. On the contrary, her deliberations were of a trivial\nsubject, even ludicrous in any other estimation than her own.\n\nSol was small, she argued within herself, the jug was large and sticky.\nHe might be tempted to lighten it, for Sol had saccharine predilections,\nand the helpless Jug was at his mercy. Sol had scant judgment and one\nsuit of clothes available; the other, sopping wet from the wash, now\nswayed in the process of drying on an elder-bush in the dooryard. Should\nhis integrity succumb, and the jug tilt too far, the stream of sorghum\nmight inundate his raiment, and the catastrophe would place him beyond\nthe pale of polite society. The seclusion of bed would be the only place\nfor Sol till such time as the elder-bush should bear the fruit of dry\nclothes.\n\n\u201cPoor Sol!\u201d she exclaimed, her prophetic sympathy bridging the chasm\nbetween possibility and accomplished fact. \u201cI\u2019ll fetch the jug myself.\nI\u2019ll take the short cut an\u2019 head him.\u201d\n\nThus she set her feet in the path of her future. It led her into dense,\ntangled woods, clambering over outcropping ledges and boulders. By the\nflare of the west she guided her progress straight to the east till she\nreached the banks of Headlong Creek on its tumultuous course down the\nmountainside. In her hasty enterprise she had not counted on crossing\nit, but Meddlesome rarely turned back. She was strong and active, and\nafter a moment\u2019s hesitation, she was springing from one to another of\nthe great, half-submerged boulders amidst the whirl of the transparent\ncrystal-brown water, with its fleck and fringe of white foam. More\nthan once, to evade the dizzying effect of the sinuous motion and the\ncontinuous roar, she stood still in midstream and gazed upward or at the\nopposite bank. The woods were dense on the slope. All in red and yellow\nand variant russet and brown tints, the canopy of the forest foliage was\nimpenetrable. The great, dark boles of oak and gum and spruce contrasted\nsharply with the white and greenish-gray trunks of beeches and\nsycamore and poplar, and, thus breaking the monotony, gave long, almost\nillimitable avenues of sylvan vistas. She noted amidst a growth of\nwillows on the opposite bank, at the waters-edge, a spring, a circular,\nrock-bound reservoir; in the marshy margin she could see the imprints of\nthe cleft hoofs of deer, and thence ran the indefinite trail known as\na deer-path. The dense covert along the steep slope was a famous\n\u201cdeer-stand,\u201d and there many a fine buck had been killed. All at once\nshe was reminded of the storied tree hard by, the tragedy of which she\nhad often bewept.\n\nThere it stood, dead itself, weird, phantasmal, as befitted the housing\nof so drear a fate. Its branches now bore no leaves. The lightnings of\na last-year\u2019s storm had scorched out its vital force and riven the fibre\nof the wood. Here and there, too, the tooth of decay had gnawed fissures\nthat the bark had not earlier known; and from one of these--she thought\nherself in a dream--a ghastly, white face looked out suddenly, and as\nsuddenly vanished!\n\nHer heart gave one wild plunge, then it seemed to cease to beat She\nwondered afterward that she did not collapse, and sink into the plunging\nrapids to drown, beaten and bruised against the rocks. It was a\nmuscular instinct that sustained her rather than a conscious impulse of\nself-preservation. Motionless, horrified, amazed, she could only gaze\nat the empty fissure of the tree on the slope. She could not then\ndiscriminate the wild, spectral imaginations that assailed her untutored\nmind. She could not remember these fantasies later. It was a relief\nso great that the anguish of the physical reaction was scarcely less\npoignant than the original shock when she realized that this face\nwas not the grisly skeleton lineaments that had looked out thence\nheretofore, but was clothed with flesh, though gaunt, pallid, furtive.\nOnce more, as she gazed, it appeared in a mere glimpse at the fissure,\nand in that instant a glance was interchanged. The next moment a hand\nappeared,--beckoning her to approach.\n\nIt was a gruesome mandate. She had scant choice. She did not doubt that\nthis was the fugitive, the \u201cwolf\u2019s head,\u201d and should she turn to flee,\nhe could stop her progress with a pistol-ball, for doubtless he would\nfancy her alert to disclose the discovery and share in the reward.\nPerhaps feminine curiosity aided fear; perhaps only her proclivity to\nfind an employ in the management of others influenced her decision;\nthough trembling in every fibre, she crossed the interval of water, and\nmade her way up the slope. But when she reached the fateful tree it was\nshe who spoke first. He cast so ravenous a glance at the basket on her\narm that all his story of want and woe was revealed. Starvation had\ninduced his disclosure of his identity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s empty,\u201d she said, inverting the basket. She watched him flinch,\nand asked wonderingly, \u201cIs game skeerce?\u201d\n\nHis eyes were at once forlorn and fierce. \u201cOh, yes, powerful skeerce,\u201d\n he replied with a bitter laugh.\n\nThere was an enigma in the rejoinder; she did not stay to read the\nriddle, but went on to possess the situation, according to her wont. \u201cYe\nhev tuk a powerful pore place ter hide,\u201d she admonished him. \u201cThis tree\nis a plumb cur\u2019osity. Gran\u2019dad Kettison war tellin\u2019 some camp-hunters\n\u2018bout\u2019n it jes this evenin\u2019. Like ez not they\u2019ll kem ter view it.\u201d\n\nHis eyes dilated with a sudden accession of terror that seemed always\na-smoulder. \u201cLawd, Lawd, Lawd!\u201d he moaned wretchedly.\n\nMeddlesome was true to her name and tradition. \u201cYe oughter hev\nremembered the Lawd \u2018fore ye done it,\u201d she said, with a repellent\nimpulse; then she would have given much to recall the reproach. The man\nwas desperate; his safety lay in her silence. A pistol-shot would secure\nit, and anger would limber the trigger.\n\nBut he did not seem indignant. His eyes, intelligent and feverishly\nbright, gazed down at her only in obvious dismay and surprise. \u201cDone\nwhat?\u201d he asked, and as, prudence prevailing for once, she did not\nreply, he spoke for her. \u201cThe murder, ye mean? Why, gal, I warn\u2019t even\nthar. I knowed nuthin\u2019 \u2018bout it till later. Ez God is my helper and my\nhope, I warn\u2019t even thar.\u201d\n\nShe stood astounded. \u201cThen why n\u2019t ye leave it ter men?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t _prove_ it ag\u2019in\u2019 the murderers\u2019 oaths. I had been consarned\nin the moonshinin\u2019 that ended in murder, but _I_ hed not been nigh the\nstill fer a month,--I war out a-huntin\u2019--when the revenuers made the\nraid. There war a scrimmage \u2018twixt the raiders an\u2019 the distillers, an\u2019\nan outsider that hed nuthin\u2019 ter do with the Federal law--he war the\nconstable o\u2019 the deestrick, an\u2019 jes rid with the gang ter see the fun\nor ter show them the way--he war killed. An\u2019 account o\u2019 _him_, the State\nlaw kem into the game. Them other moonshiners war captured, an\u2019 they\nswore ag\u2019in\u2019 me \u2018bout the shootin\u2019 ter save tharselves, but I hearn thar\nfalse oaths hev done them no good, they being held as accessory. An\u2019 I\nbe so ez I can\u2019t prove an alibi--I can\u2019t _prove_ it, though it\u2019s God\u2019s\ntruth. But before high heaven\u201d--he lifted his gaunt right hand--\u201cI am\ninnercent, I am inner-cent.\u201d\n\nShe could not have said why,--perhaps she realized afterward,--but\nshe believed him absolutely, implicitly. A fervor of sympathy for his\nplight, of commiseration, surged up in her heart. \u201cI wisht it war so I\ncould gin ye some pervisions,\u201d she sighed, \u201cthough ye do \u2018pear toler\u2019ble\ntriflin\u2019 ter lack game.\u201d\n\nThen the dread secret was told. \u201cGal,\u201d--he used the word as a polite\nform of address, the equivalent of the more sophisticated \u201clady,\u201d--\u201cef\nye will believe me, all my ammunition is spent. Not a ca\u2019tridge lef\u2019,\nnot a dust of powder.\u201d\n\nMeddy caught both her hands to her lips to intercept and smother a cry\nof dismay.\n\n\u201cI snared a rabbit two days ago in a dead-fall. My knife-blade is bruk,\nbut I reckon thar is enough lef\u2019 ter split my jugular whenst the eend is\nkem at last.\u201d\n\nThe girl suddenly caught her faculties together. \u201cWhat sorter fool talk\nis that!\u201d she demanded sternly.\u2019 \u201cYe do my bid, ef ye knows what\u2019s good\nfer ye. Git out\u2019n this trap of a tree an\u2019 hide \u2018mongst the crevices\nof the rocks till seben o \u2018clock ternight. Then kem up ter Gran\u2019dad\nKettison\u2019s whenst it is cleverly dark an\u2019 tap on the glass winder--not\non the batten shutter. An\u2019 I\u2019ll hev cartridges an\u2019 powder an\u2019 ball for\nye\u2019 an\u2019 some victuals ready, too.\u201d\n\nBut the fugitive, despite his straits, demurred. \u201cI don\u2019t want ter git\nold man Kettison into trouble for lendin\u2019 ter me.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018T ain\u2019t his\u2019n. \u2018T is my dad\u2019s old buckshot ca\u2019tridges an\u2019 powder an\u2019\nball. They belong ter me. The other childern is my half-brothers, bein\u2019\nmy mother war married twice. Ye kin _steal_ this gear from me, ef that\nwill make ye feel easier.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what will yer gran\u2019dad say ter me?\u201d \u201cHe won\u2019t know who ye be; he\nwill jes \u2018low ye air one o\u2019 the boys who air always foolin\u2019 away thar\ntime visitin\u2019 me an\u2019 makin\u2019 tallow-dips skeerce.\u201d The sudden gleam\nof mirth on her face was like an illuminating burst of sunshine, and\nsomehow it cast an irradiation into the heart of the fugitive, for,\nafter she was gone out of sight, he pondered upon it.\n\nBut the early dusk fell from a lowering sky, and the night came on\nbeclouded and dark. Some turbulent spirit was loosed in the air, and the\nwind was wild. Great, surging masses of purple vapor came in a mad rout\nfrom the dank west and gathered above the massive and looming mountains.\nThe woods bent and tossed and clashed their boughs in the riot, of\ngusts, the sere leaves were flying in clouds, and presently rain began\nto fall. The steady downpour increased in volume to torrents; then the\nbroad, pervasive flashes of lightning showed, in lieu of myriad lines,\nan unbroken veil of steely gray swinging from the zenith, the white foam\nrebounding as the masses of water struck the earth. The camp equipage,\ntents and wagons succumbed beneath the fury of the tempest, and, indeed,\nthe hunters had much ado to saddle their horses and grope their way\nalong the bridle-path that led to old Kettison\u2019s house.\n\nThe rude comfort of the interior had a heightened emphasis by reason\nof the elemental turmoils without. True, the rain beat in a deafening\nfusillade upon the roof, and the ostentation of the one glass window, a\nsource of special pride to its owner, was at a temporary disadvantage in\nadmitting the fierce and ghastly electric glare, so recurrent as to seem\nunintermittent. But the more genial illumination of hickory flames, red\nand yellow, was streaming from the great chimney-place, and before\nthe broad hearth the guests were ensconced, their outstretched boots\nsteaming in the heat. Strings of scarlet peppers, bunches of dried\nherbs, gourds of varied quaint shapes, hung swaying from the rafters.\nThe old man\u2019s gay, senile chirp of welcome was echoed by his wife,\na type of comely rustic age, who made much of the fact that, though\nhousebound from \u201crheumatics,\u201d she had reared her dead daughter\u2019s \u201ctwo\norphin famblies,\u201d the said daughter having married twice, neither man\n\u201cbein\u2019 of a lastin\u2019 quality,\u201d as she seriously phrased it. Meddy, \u201cthe\neldest fambly,\u201d had been guide, philosopher, and friend to the swarm\nof youngsters, and even now, in the interests of peace and space and\nhearing, was seeking to herd them into an adjoining room, when a sudden\nstentorian hail from without rang through the splashing of the rain from\nthe eaves, the crash of thunder among the \u201cbalds\u201d of the mountains, with\nits lofty echoes, and the sonorous surging of the wind.\n\n\u201cLight a tallow-dip, Meddy,\u201d cried old Kettison, excitedly. \u201cAn\u2019 fetch\nthe candle on the porch so ez we-uns kin view who rides so late in sech\na night \u2018fore we bid \u2018em ter light an\u2019 hitch.\u201d\n\nBut these were travelers not to be gainsaid--the sheriff of the county\nand four stout fellows from the town of Colbury, summoned to his aid as\na posse, all trooping in as if they owned the little premises. However,\nthe officer permitted himself to unbend a trifle under the influence of\na hospitable tender of home-made cherry-bounce, \u201cstrong enough to walk\nfrom here to Colbury,\u201d according to the sheriff\u2019s appreciative phrase.\nHe was a portly man, with a rolling, explanatory cant of his burly head\nand figure toward his interlocutor as he talked. His hair stood up in\ntwo tufts above his forehead, one on each side, and he had large, round,\ngrayish eyes and a solemn, pondering expression. To Meddy, staring\nhorror-stricken, he seemed as owlishly wise as he looked while he\nexplained the object of his expedition.\n\n\u201cThis district have got a poor reputation with the law, Mr. Kettison.\nHere is this fellow, Boyston McGurny, been about here two years, and a\nreward for five hundred dollars out for his arrest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Boy\u2019s fault, Sher\u2019ff, not our\u2019n,\u201d leered the glib old man. He,\ntoo, had had a sip of the stalwart cherry-bounce. \u201cBoy\u2019s in no wise\nsociable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s plumb flying in the face of the law,\u201d declared the officer. \u201cIf\nI had a guide, I\u2019d not wait a minute, or if I could recognize the man\nwhenst I viewed him. The constable promised to send a fellow to meet me\nhere,--what\u2019s his name!--yes, Smith, Barton Smith,--who will guide us to\nwhere he was last glimpsed. I hope to take him alive.\u201d he added with an\ninflection of doubt.\n\nCertainly this was a dreary camp-hunt, with all its distasteful\nsequelae. Purcell, who had no more imagination than a promissory note,\nsilently sulked under the officer\u2019s intimation that, being able-bodied\nmen, he would expect the hunters also to ride with him. They were not of\nhis county, and doubted their obligation, but they would not refuse\nto aid the law. Bygrave, however, realized a \u201cstory\u201d in the air, and\nSeymour was interested in the impending developments; for being a close\nobserver, he had perceived that the girl was in the clutch of some\ntumultuous though covert agitation. Her blood blazed at fever-heat in\nher cheeks; her eyes were on fire; every muscle was tense; and her brain\nwhirled. To her the crisis was tremendous. This was the result of her\nunwarranted interference. Who was she, indeed, that she should seek\nto command the march of events and deploy sequences? Her foolish\nmaneuvering had lured this innocent man to ruin, capture, anguish,\nand death. No warning could he have; the window was opaque with the\ncorrugations of the rainfall on the streaming panes, and set too high\nto afford him a glimpse from without. And, oh, how he would despise\nthe traitor that she must needs seem to be! She had not a moment for\nreflection, for counsel, for action. Already the signal,--he was prompt\nat the tryst,--the sharp, crystalline vibration of the tap on the glass!\n\nThe sheriff rose instantly with that cumbrous agility sometimes\ncharacterizing portly men. \u201cThere he is now!\u201d he exclaimed.\n\nBut Meddy, with a little hysterical cry, had sprung first to the opening\ndoor. \u201cBarton Smith!\u201d she exclaimed, with shrill significance. \u201cHyar is\nyer guide, Sher\u2019ff, wet ez a drownded rat.\u201d\n\nThe pale face in the dark aperture of the doorway, as the fire-light\nflashed on it, grew ghastly white with terror and lean with amazement.\nFor a moment the man seemed petrified. Seymour, vaguely fumbling with\nhis suspicions, began to disintegrate the plot of the play, and to\ndiscriminate the powers of the dramatis person\u00e6.\n\n\u201cNow, my man, step lively,\u201d said the officer in his big, husky voice.\n\u201cDo you know this Royston McGurny?\u201d\n\nTo be sure, Seymour had no cause for suspicion but his own intuition and\nthe intangible evidence of tone and look all as obvious to the others as\nto him. But he was at once doubtful and relieved when the haggard wretch\nat the door, mustering his courage, replied: \u201cKnow Royston McGurny! None\nbetter. Knowed him all my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cGot pretty good horse?\u201d\n\n\u201cGot none at all; expect ter borry Mr. Kettison\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go show ye whar the saddle be,\u201d exclaimed Meddy, with her wonted\nofficious-ness, and glibly picking up the bits of her shattered scheme.\nSeymour fully expected they would not return from the gloom without,\nwhither they had disappeared, but embrace the immediate chance of escape\nbefore the inopportune arrival of the real Barton Smith should balk the\npossibility. But, no,--and he doubted anew all his suspicions,--in\na trice here they both were again, a new courage, a new hope in that\npallid, furtive face, and another horse stood saddled among the equine\ngroup at the door. Meddlesome was pinning up the brown skirt of her\ngown, showing a red petticoat that had harmonies with a coarse, red\nplaid shawl adjusted over her head and shoulders.\n\n\u201cGran\u2019dad,\u201d she observed, never looking up, and speaking with her mouth\nfull of pins, \u201cBarton Smith say he kin set me down at Aunt Drusina\u2019s\nhouse. Ye know she be ailin\u2019, an\u2019 sent for me this evenin\u2019; but I hed no\nway ter go.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff looked sour enough at this intrusion; but he doubtless\nimagined that this relative was no distant neighbor, and as he had need\nof hearty aid and popular support, he offered no protest.\n\nThere was a clearing sky without, and the wind was laid. The frenzy\nof the storm was over, although rain was still falling. The little\ncavalcade got to horse deliberately enough amid the transparent dun\nshadows and dim yellow flare of light from open door and window. One\nof the mounts had burst a girth, and a strap must be procured from\nthe plow-gear in the shed. Another, a steed of some spirit, reared and\nplunged at the lights, and could not be induced to cross the illuminated\nbar thrown athwart the yard from the open door. The official impatience\nof the delay was expressed in irritable comments and muttered oaths; but\nthroughout the interval the guide, with his pallid, strained face,\nsat motionless in his saddle, his rifle across its pommel, an apt\npresentment of indifference, while, perched behind him, Meddy was\ncontinually busy in readjusting her skirts or shawl or a small bundle\nthat presumably contained her rustic finery, but which, to a close\napproach, would have disclosed the sulphurous odor of gunpowder. When\nthe cluster of horsemen was fairly on the march, however, she sat quite\nstill, and more than once Seymour noted that, with her face close to\nthe shoulder of the guide, she was whispering in his ear. What was their\ngarnet he marvelled, having once projected the idea that this late comer\nwas, himself, the \u201cwolf\u2019s head\u201d whom they were to chase down for a rich\nreward, incongruously hunting amidst his own hue and cry. Or, Seymour\nagain doubted, had he merely constructed a figment of a scheme from his\nown imaginings and these attenuations of suggestion? For there seemed,\nafter all, scant communication between the two, and this was even less\nwhen the moon was unveiled, the shifting shimmer of the clouds\nfalling away from the great sphere of pearl, gemming the night with\nan incomparable splendor. It had grown almost as light as day, and the\nsheriff ordered the pace quickened. Along a definite cattle-trail they\nwent at first, but presently they were following through bosky recesses\na deer-path, winding sinuously at will on the way to water. The thinning\nfoliage let in the fair, ethereal light, and all the sylvan aisles\nstood in sheeny silver illumination. The drops of moisture glittered\njewel-wise on the dark boughs of fir and pine, and one could even\ndiscriminate the red glow of sour-wood and the golden flare of hickory,\nso well were the chromatic harmonies asserted in this refined and\nrefulgent glamour.\n\n\u201cBarton Smith!\u201d called the sheriff, suddenly from the rear of the party.\nThere was no answer, and Seymour felt his prophetic blood run cold.\nHis conscience began to stir. Had he, indeed, no foundation for his\nsuspicion?\n\n\u201cSmith! _Smith_\u201d cried the irascible officer. \u201cHey, there! Is the man\ndeaf!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot deef, edzac\u2019ly,\u201d Meddlesome\u2019s voice sounded reproachfully; \u201cjes a\nleetle hard o\u2019 hear in\u2019.\u201d She had administered a warning nudge.\n\n\u201cHey? What ye want?\u201d said the \u201cWolf\u2019s Head,\u201d suddenly checking his\nhorse.\n\n\u201cHave you any idea of where you are going, or how far?\u201d demanded the\nofficer, sternly.\n\n\u201cJust acrost the gorge,\u201d the guide answered easily.\n\n\u201cI heard he had been glimpsed in a hollow tree. That word was telephoned\nfrom the cross-roads to town. It was the tree the skeleton was in.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat tree? It\u2019s away back yander,\u201d observed one of the posse, reluctant\nand disaffected.\n\n\u201cOh, he has quit that tree; he is bound for up the gorge now,\u201d said the\nguide.\n\n\u201cWell, I suppose you know, from what I was told,\u201d said the sheriff,\ndiscontentedly; \u201cbut this is a long ja\u2019nt. Ride up! Ride up!\u201d\n\nOnward they fared through the perfumed woods. The wild asters were\nblooming, and sweet and subtile distillations of the autumnal growths\nwere diffused on the air. The deer are but ill at road-making,--such\ntangled coverts, such clifty ledges, such wild leaps; for now the path\nthreaded the jagged verge of precipices. The valley, a black abyss above\nwhich massive, purplish mountains loomed against a sky of pearly tints,\nwas visibly narrowing. They all knew that presently it would become a\nmere gorge, a vast indentation in the mountain-side. The weird vistas\nacross the gorge were visible how, craggy steeps, and deep woods\nfilled with moonlight, with that peculiar untranslated intendment which\ndifferentiates its luminosity in the wilderness from the lunar glamour\n\u2018of cultivated Scenes--something weird, melancholy, eloquent of a\nmeaning addressed to the soul, but which the senses cannot entertain or\nwords express.\n\nWith a sudden halt, the guide dismounted. The girl still sat on the\nsaddle-blanket, and the horse bowed his head and pawed. The posse were\ngazing dubiously, reluctantly, at a foot-bridge across a deep abyss. It\nwas only a log, the upper side hewn, with a shaking hand-rail held by\nslight standards.\n\n\u201cHave we got to cross this?\u201d asked the officer, still in the saddle and\ngazing downward.\n\n\u201cEf ye foller me,\u201d said the guide, indifferently.\n\nBut he was ahead of his orders. He visibly braced his nerves for the\neffort, and holding his rifle as a balancing-pole, he sped along the\nlight span with a tread as deft as a fox or a wolf. In a moment he had\ngained the farther side.\n\nThey scarcely knew how it happened. So unexpected was the event that,\nthough it occurred before their eyes, they did not seem to see it. They\nremembered, rather than perceived, that he stooped suddenly; with one\nsingle great effort of muscular force he dislodged the end of the\nlog, heaved it up in the air, strongly flung it aside, whence it went\ncrashing down into the black depths below, its own weight, as it fell,\nsufficing to wrench out the other end, carrying with it a mass of earth\nand rock from the verge of the precipice.\n\nThe horses sprang back snorting and frightened; the officer\u2019s, being a\nfine animal in prime condition, tried to bolt. Before he had him well\nin hand again, the man on the opposite brink had vanished. The sheriff\u2019s\nsuspicions were barely astir when a hallooing voice in the rear made\nitself heard, and a horseman, breathless with haste, his steed flecked\nwith foam, rode up, indignant, flushed, and eager.\n\n\u201cWhyn\u2019t ye wait for me, Sher\u2019ff? Ye air all on the wrong track,\u201d he\ncried. \u201cBoyston McGurny be hid in the skellington\u2019s tree. I glimpsed him\nthar myself, an\u2019 gin information.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff gazed down with averse and suspicious eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s all\nthis!\u201d he said sternly. \u201cGive an account of yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe!\u201d exclaimed the man in amazement. \u201cWhy, I\u2019m Barton Smith, yer guide,\nthat\u2019s who. An\u2019 I\u2019m good for five hundred dollars\u2019 reward.\u201d\n\nBut the sheriff called off the pursuit for the time, as he had no means\nof replacing the bridge or of crossing the chasm.\n\nMeddlesome\u2019s share in the escape was not detected, and for a while she\nhad no incentive to the foolhardiness of boasting. But her prudence\ndiminished when the reward for the apprehension of Boyston McGurny was\nsuddenly withdrawn. The confession of one of the distillers, dying of\ntuberculosis contracted in prison, who had himself fired the fatal shot,\nhad established the alibi that McGurny claimed, and served to relieve\nhim of all suspicion.\n\nHe eventually became a \u201cherder\u201d of cattle on the bald of the mountain\nand a farmer in a small way, and in these placid pursuits he found a\ncontented existence. But, occasionally, a crony of his olden time would\ncontrast the profits of this tame industry at a disadvantage with the\nquick and large returns of the \u201cwild cat,\u201d when he would \u201cconfess and\navoid.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true, that\u2019s all true; but a man can\u2019t holp it no ways in the\nworld whenst he hev got a wife that is so out-an\u2019-out meddlesome that\nshe won\u2019t let him run ag\u2019in\u2019 the law, nohow he kin fix it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n",
